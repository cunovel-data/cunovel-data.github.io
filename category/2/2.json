The tale begins in New York, where Lestat, the coolest of Rice\u0027s vampire heroes, is stalking a big-time cocaine dealer and religious-art smuggler--this guy should get it in the neck. Lestat is also growing fascinated with the dealer\u0027s lovely daughter, a TV evangelist who\u0027s not a fraud. Lestat is also being stalked himself, by some shadowy guy who turns out to be Memnoch, the devil, who spirits him away. From here on, the book might have been called Interview with the Devil (by a Vampire). It\u0027s a rousing story interrupted by a long debate with the devil. Memnoch isn\u0027t the devil as ordinarily conceived: he got the boot from God because he objected to God\u0027s heartless indifference to human misery. Memnoch takes Lestat to heaven, hell, and throughout history.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/memnoch-the-devil-the-vampire-chronicles-5.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":2,"name":"Horror","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}},{"id":2214,"title":"The Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles #6)","description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cstrong\u003eStoryline: \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e \n \u003cp\u003eThe Vampire Armand (The Vampire Chronicles #6) \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eArmand until now has played a small role in the Vampire Chronicles.
