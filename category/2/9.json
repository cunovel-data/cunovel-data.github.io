Mankind is silently infected by a millennia-old bacteria unknowingly exhumed by a scientific expedition in Antarctica. Now, in some rare cases, a person\u0027s so-called \"junk DNA\" becomes activated, and depending on their racial and ethnic heritage they begin to manifest one of the many diverse forms of the \"others\" that are the true basis for the legends of supernatural creatures. These aren\u0027t your usual vampires and werewolves - it goes much deeper than that. Conceived by Jonathan Maberry, V Wars features stories from various \"frontlines\" as reported by such contributors as Nancy Holder, Yvonne Navarro, James A. Moore, Gregory Frost, John Everson, Keith R.A. DeCandido, and Scott Nicholson (as well as Maberry himself, of course). The result is a compelling series of tales that create a unique chronicle of mankind\u0027s response to this sudden, hidden threat to humanity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/v-wars.jpg","author":"Jonathan Maberry","type":"Horror","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":2,"name":"Horror","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}},{"id":2572,"title":"Black Blood (The Last Vampire #2)","description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cstrong\u003eStoryline: \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e \n \u003cp\u003eBlack Blood (The Last Vampire #2) \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eThe terrifying sequel to The Last Vampire.

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. \"World War Z\" is the result.

Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, \"By excluding the human factor, aren\u0027t we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it?
