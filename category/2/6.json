This millennium\u0027s savior has come in the form of Damali Richards, a hip-hop diva with the heart of a warrior and an attitude to match. But a war in Hell has cost Damali both her powers and her past love, Carlos Rivera. Still, Damali can\u0027t let her grief stand in her way. Several gruesome deaths, starting with an American research team, have come to Damali\u0027s attention in Brazil.

Reunited, Damali and Carlos give in to the erotic passion they have fought for so long. Together, they are a powerful force.

But Carlos and Damali should know by now that there is no rest for the saviors of the known world. One of the four topside Master vampires has stolen one of the Keys-the living blood of Christ---that opens the sixth seal as foretold in Revelations. He who possesses the Key and the Seal can decide to the outcome of the Final War, a.k.a. Armageddon. With a vampire in possession of the Key, the balance between the Light and the Dark have been thrown off and even Damali is deeply effected. She is now sporting a pair of fangs. In order to retrieve the Key, Carlos and Damali are quickly thrust into a web of vampire politics and intrigue. And when Carlos\u0027s secret drug, Oblivion, finds its way into the hands of the enemies, even the seventh level of Hell comes calling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-bitten-vampire-huntress-legend-4.jpg","author":"L.A.
