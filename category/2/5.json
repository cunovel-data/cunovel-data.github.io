The vampire Saint-Germain seeks sanctuary at an isolated monastery, unwilling to abandon the hundreds of terrified villagers he has led in flight from the Huns. A few Roman soldiers and some village Watchmen are the monastery\u0027s defense force - and they are undermined by the religious fervor of some of the monks, who argue that since everyone\u0027s fate is in God\u0027s hands, it is foolish to defend themselves. In the hothouse atmosphere of the high-walled monastery, Saint-Germain must take special care when slaking his vampire thirst, for discovery of his True Nature will result in his True Death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/burning-shadows-saint-germain-23.jpg","author":"Chelsea Quinn Yarbro","type":"Horror","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":2,"name":"Horror","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}},{"id":2506,"title":"An Embarrassment of Riches (Saint-Germain #24)","description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cstrong\u003eStoryline: \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e \n \u003cp\u003eAn Embarrassment of Riches (Saint-Germain #24) \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eMore than two decades strong, the Saint-Germain cycle is one of the most compelling works of dark fantasy and horror of our age. Historically accurate, often involving key events or figures from throughout world history, these deeply emotional novels have a devoted readership. Each novel is written as a stand-alone and they are not chronologically consecutive, so readers may enter the saga with any book and move backward or forward in time as they choose, from Pharaonic Egypt to Paris in the 1700s, from the fall of the Roman Empire to World War II Europe. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eIn An Embarrassment of Riches, the vampire Count finds himself a virtual prisoner in the Court of Kunigunde in Bohemia in the 1200s. Rakoczy Ferncsi, as Saint-Germain is known, passes his days making jewels to delight Queen Kunigunde and trying not to become involved in the Court\u0027s intrigues. In this, the vampire fails. Handsome, apparently wealthy, and obviously unmarried, he soon finds himself being sexually blackmailed by Rozsa, an ambitious lady-in-waiting. If he does not satisfy her, she will denounce him to the priests and he\u0027ll be burned at the stake, resulting in his True Death. Despite his care, the vampire makes more than one enemy at the Bohemian Court, and by the end of An Embarrassment of Riches, the Count can see only one road to freedom...through death.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/an-embarrassment-of-riches-saint-germain-24.jpg","author":"Chelsea Quinn Yarbro","type":"Horror","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":2,"name":"Horror","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}},{"id":2507,"title":"A Mortal Glamour","description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cstrong\u003eStoryline: \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e \n \u003cp\u003eAmidst the many calamities of the late 14th century something sinister is at work among the sisters of la Tres Saunte Annunciacion, a force the women and the men around them seem powerless to fight?
