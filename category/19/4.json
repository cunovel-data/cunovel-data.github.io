The prime suspect, a minister\u0027s son, was also dead, the victim of a jailhouse suicide. The case is closed, as far as the NYPD is concerned. Now the murdered prostitute\u0027s father wants it opened again-and that\u0027s where Matthew Scudder comes in. But this assignment carries the unmistakable stench of sleaze and perversion, luring ex-cop-turned-investigator Scudder into a sordid world of phony religion and murderous lust where children must die for their parents most secret, unspeakable sins.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-sins-of-the-fathers-matthew-scudder-1.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":0,"category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}},{"id":2320,"title":"In the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3)","description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cstrong\u003eStoryline: \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e \n \u003cp\u003eIn the Midst of Death (Matthew Scudder #3) \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eBad cop Jerry Broadfield didn\u0027t make any friends on the force when he volunteered to squeal to an ambitious d.a. about police corruption.

And the more \"clients, \" he figured, the more money - and more people eager to see him dead. So no one is surprised when the pigeon is found floating in the East River with his skull bashed in. And what\u0027s worse, no one cares - except Matthew Scudder. The ex-cop-turned-private-eye is no conscientious avenging angel.
