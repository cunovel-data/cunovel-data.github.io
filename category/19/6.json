With his French-born mother dying—and divulging to her son one last, stunning secret—Reacher is forced to question everything he once believed…about his family, his career, his loyalties—and himself. Because this soldier’s son is on his way into the darkness, where he finds a tangled drama of desperate desires and violent death—and a conspiracy more chilling, ingenious, and treacherous than anyone could have guessed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-enemy-jack-reacher-8.jpg","author":"Lee Child","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}},{"id":2347,"title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher #9)","description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cstrong\u003eStoryline: \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e \n \u003cp\u003eOne Shot (Jack Reacher #9) \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eSix shots.
