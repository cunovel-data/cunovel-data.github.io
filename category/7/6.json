Published in 1854, it details Thoreau\u0027s sojourn in a cabin near Walden Pond, amidst woodland owned by his friend and mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson, near Concord, Massachusetts. Thoreau lived at Walden for two years, two months, and two days, but Walden was written so that the stay appears to be a year, with expressed seasonal divisions. Thoreau did not intend to live as a hermit, for he received visitors and returned their visits. Instead, he hoped to isolate himself from society in order to gain a more objective understanding of it. Simplicity and self-reliance were Thoreau\u0027s other goals, and the whole project was inspired by Transcendentalist philosophy. However the house was not in wilderness but at the edge of town, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) from his family home, and his mother cooked him meals and cleaned the house.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/walden.jpg","author":"Henry David Thoreau","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":0,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}},{"id":1579,"title":"The Hunt (The Hunt #1)","description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cstrong\u003eStoryline: \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e \n \u003cp\u003eThe Hunt (The Hunt #1) \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eDon\u0027t Sweat.

When Kyle meets him in a sting operation, Tarr turns the tables and takes him captive—he intends to give Kyle to his twin brother Taz, to become his love slave. Taz wants nothing to do with any Lycan, the ones who held him on their planet as a prisoner of war. Yet the second he sees Kyle, drugged, naked and bound in a cage on Tarr’s ship, he knows he has to save him. When Kyle awakens, he sees his mate in Taz and imprints on him immediately, in the way of Lycan wolves. Both men are extremely dominant, but only one can win this struggle between them. Meanwhile, Kyle’s family is planning a rescue, and they don’t care who gets in the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/captive-wolf-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-5.jpg","author":"Shannon West","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":0,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}},{"id":1596,"title":"Wolf\u0027s Bounty (Love Slaves of the Alphas #6)","description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cstrong\u003eStoryline: \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e \n \u003cp\u003eWolf\u0027s Bounty (Love Slaves of the Alphas #6) \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eLarsson Balenescu is trying hard to get over the fact that his fated mate is not only a Tygerian, and one of the Alliance’s most bitter enemies, but also the fact that he’s Tarr Bonnet, one of the worst pirates and sex slave traffickers in the known galaxies. When Larsson discovers that Tarr has put a price on his head, he’s furious, and vows never to mate with the man, no matter how painful it is for him to stay away from him. Soon he’s captured by Tarr’s men and taken to his ship where Tarr sets out to claim him as his love slave.
