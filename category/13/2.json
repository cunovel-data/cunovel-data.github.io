His boss is taken with the royal redhead -- brunette, whatever, it\u0027s not like he keeps track of that stuff -- and nobody realizes that he just wants to be left alone in his lab. All alone. All the time. Weekends, holidays -- it\u0027s all good. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eNow here\u0027s Miss Royalpants, insisting that he escort her around the marine institute, explain what he s doing, kiss her until her toes curl -- no, wait, that was his idea. She\u0027s not even apologetic about being born into a royal family! Says it\u0027s his problem to overcome, not hers. Which leaves him with one option: to kiss her again. And again. And... \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eSo she\u0027s nothing like he expected. In fact, Dr. Rivers can see that this fantastic, exasperating woman has problems no princess should ever have to deal with. And he has an idea to help her get some much-needed sleep. Of course, it involves getting very, very tired beforehand, but if she\u0027s up to it, then so is he...\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-royal-pain-alaskan-royal-family-2.jpg","author":"MaryJanice Davidson","type":"Humorous","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":0,"category":{"id":13,"name":"Humorous","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}},{"id":2791,"title":"The Royal Mess (Alaskan Royal Family #3)","description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cstrong\u003eStoryline: \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e \n \u003cp\u003eThe Royal Mess (Alaskan Royal Family #3) \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eJeffrey Rodinov is descended from one of the oldest families in Alaska, and a Rodinov has been protecting a Baranov for generations. It\u0027s a job Jeffrey takes VERY seriously. Six feet four inches, 220 fatless lbs., black hair, and blue eyes;weapon of choice: the 9 mm Beretta. In a pinch? His fists. IQ: 157. (Yes, crossword puzzle, in ink, just after taking out the guy behind you. No thanks necessary.) No one ever sees Jeffrey Rodinov coming, and no one--not even a mouthy, illegitimate princess--is going to keep him from playing bodyguard when his king decrees it. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eRight. But no Rodinov ever had to protect Princess Nicole Krenski. Her credentials? Hunting guide in the Alaskan wilderness. Smart. Stubborn bordering on exasperating. Five-seven. Blue eyes. Very kissable mouth. Very kissable neck, back, legs, wrists, earlobes. The lady says she doesn\u0027t need a bodyguard, but that\u0027s where she\u0027s wrong. Someone needs to watch her and show her the royal ropes (and cuffs. . .and scarves. . .). Someone who can make her feel like a queen--in and out of bed. And that\u0027s a job Jeffrey Rodinov takes very seriously as well. . .\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-royal-mess-alaskan-royal-family-3.jpg","author":"MaryJanice Davidson","type":"Humorous","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":0,"category":{"id":13,"name":"Humorous","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}},{"id":2792,"title":"My Side","description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cstrong\u003eStoryline: \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e \n \u003cp\u003eErin Benson felt like she\u0027d won the lottery when she arrived all the way from North Dakota with the keys to her first home in hand. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eCrisp white walls: Check. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eBreathtaking view of downtown Boston: Check. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eMinutes from Northeastern School of Law: Check. \u003c/p\u003e\n \u003cp\u003eBut home is not always where the heart is.
