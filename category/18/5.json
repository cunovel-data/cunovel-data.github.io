Zombie cowboys and spectral cattle drives are kicking up dust, the local weather girls are total witches who forecast perfect storms, and some Hollywood fanatic is recasting zombies as the greatest stars of the silver screen. And speaking of silver, Delilahâ€™s special affinity for the all-purpose monster-repellent leads her posse straight down a silver brick roadâ€”and into a notso- fun house of mirrorsâ€”putting her face-to-face with her dicey past and a mystery woman named Lilith, whoâ€™s a real dead ringer for Delilah. The key word being dead.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/silver-zombie-delilah-street-4.jpg","author":"Carole Nelson Douglas","type":"Fantasy","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":0,"category":{"id":18,"name":"Fantasy","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}},{"id":2119,"title":"Armor","description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cstrong\u003eStoryline: \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e \n \u003cp\u003eArmor is, I believe, my favorite science fiction novel ever. It follows to basic plotlines -- one is the story of a desperate soldier fighting an impossible war, the other from the point of view of an ex-pirate escaped from prison who joined up with the wrong crew. The two plots do intertwine, but the plots aren\u0027t the appeal of this novel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/armor.jpg","author":"John Steakley","type":"Fantasy","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":0,"category":{"id":18,"name":"Fantasy","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}]
