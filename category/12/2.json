The down-on-his-luck repo man has just been hired to repossess Teddy\u0027s boat. Little does he know there\u0027s a baseball card on board that some men are willing to kill for. Thus begins a rip-roaring cross-country odyssey-and with bodies piling up, the squeeze is on for the penultimate piece of Americana. And Conner will be lucky if he ends up back where he started: broke and (still) breathing. \"From the Hardcover edition.\"\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/suicide-squeeze.jpg","author":"Victor Gischler","type":"Thriller","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":0,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Thriller","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}},{"id":2246,"title":"Gun Monkeys","description":"\u003cdiv\u003e\n \u003cstrong\u003eStoryline: \u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e \n\u003cdiv\u003e \n \u003cp\u003eCharlie Swift just pumped three .38-caliber bullets into a dead polar bear in his taxidermist girlfriend’s garage.
