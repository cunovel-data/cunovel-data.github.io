I was worried about you.” Larsson laughed. “I only wish I had a picture of you in that dress!” “Damn it, it wasn’t a dress! It was harem pants. They didn’t have anything else in my size, so I said I’d wear them. I didn’t know Lucas was going to blow a gasket when he saw them.” Lucas smiled and shook his head. “Harem pants…leave it to you to be kidnapped and wind up in a harem!” Nikolai grinned back at him and came over to lean against the rail. “It wasn’t a harem exactly— just me and my mate, and I was his concubine—it’s kind of a long story.” Lucas regarded him fondly, a look of relaxed relief on his face now that they had him back. “You just couldn’t stand to be outdone by Blayde, could you? You had to go and get yourself a prince.” “Prince Charming at that!” Konnor said, bent over laughing. “I thought I’d bust a gut when your handsome prince was talking about you sleeping in the cinders! I remember that old fairy tale Nanna used to tell us.” Nanna had been the human concubine of their Lycan great-grandmother, purchased for her by their notorious great-grandfather to help distract her from his sexual exploits. She had been a sweet woman with a wide, comfortable lap, and she would tell the cousins stories for hours. The story of Cinderella had been one of their favorites when they were all quite small. Kyle and the others joined in the general laughter, and Nikolai shrugged. “Well, he wondered why I wasn’t fighting him about being his love slave. I had to come up with something. Thank goodness he’d never heard the story of Cinderella before.” “Cinderella…” Lucas shook his head, still grinning. “With me as the wicked stepmother, I guess.” Nikolai returned his grin. “Yep—and all the rest of you as wicked stepsisters.” Lucas shook his head. “I guess the wicked stepmother role is marginally better than being the fairy godmother.” The on-board computer interrupted then, the monotone female voice reporting calmly. “Attention, please. Disturbance on deck two, cabin four.” Nikolai recognized his room location with a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. “What kind of disturbance, computer?” “The life form inside the room is trying to break down the door, sir.” “How in all the hells is he doing that?” “By kicking it, sir.” Nikolai stood up and sighed. “Shit. Only Jagger would try to kick down a steel door. I better go check on him before he hurts himself. I hoped he’d stay asleep for a little while. Guess not.” He waved a hand at his family as he walked toward the lift. “Be back as soon as I can.” Nikolai could hear the banging sounds as he entered the corridor, and the noise grew louder as he came up to the door of his room, a loud, rhythmic thumping on the other side of the door. Nikolai could barely fit the key in the lock for the strength of the vibrations on the door. Managing to get the key in and swing the door wide open, he was just in time to see Jagger’s boot come toward him. Nikolai caught it in his hand and glowered at his mate. “Damn, baby. It’s a solid steel door. I admire the effort, but did you really think you could kick it down?” Jagger reeled away from him, pulling his boot back so forcefully he fell on his ass and scooted backward toward the far wall. “S-stay away from me! Don’t come any closer! Don’t touch me!” Nikolai raised one eyebrow and leaned against the door frame. “Settle down, sweetheart. It’s just me. You slept naked in my arms the past two nights. A little late to play the outraged virgin, isn’t it?” Ignoring his words, Jagger got to his feet and backed slowly to the wall, his eyes darting around the room, trying to gain an advantage. Nikolai stepped further into the room, holding out his hand. “Sweetheart…?” “Stay away! Y-you’re a monster! I-I saw what you did! I saw you ch-change!” Nikolai continued to walk slowly toward him, holding his hands out, palms up. “Baby, calm down. I’m Lycan. You know that—you know it’s what we do, right?” “Stay away from me!” Jagger broke and tried to run around Nikolai, but Nikolai caught him around the waist and pulled his backside up to his body, wrapping both arms around him and holding him tight. Jagger went crazy, kicking and squirming out of control. He was fighting so hard, Nikolai feared he would hurt himself, so he threw him on the bed and lay down full out on top of him, holding his hands over his head and keeping his kicking legs tightly confined with his own. It took about five minutes of struggling for all he was worth, but finally Jagger exhausted himself, sagging down and trying hard to catch his breath. Nikolai pressed his lips to Jagger’s ear, murmuring endearments to him, assuring him he was safe. Finally, his body relaxed, though he kept his face turned stubbornly away, biting his lower lip so hard he brought a few drops of blood to the surface. Nikolai licked the drops away and drew back, staring down at his mate. “Better?” Obstinately, Jagger refused to look at him. Instead, he said, “Let me up,” in a firm tone. “Not until I’m sure you’re not going to hurt yourself freaking out.” Jagger made a little snorting sound and cut his eyes resentfully over to Nikolai. “Hurt myself? Damn it, I’m not a child. Please remove yourself from my person. You’re going to take me back home. Right now!” The corners of Nikolai’s mouth quirked, but he stayed where he was. “You’ve got it all wrong, love. You don’t make the rules anymore. You’re—what was it you called it? Spoils of war, that’s it. You belong to me now, and I think I’ll keep you.” Jagger hissed in a sharp breath and cast Nikolai a furious glance. “No!” he said. “Niki, let me go. Don’t do this!” “I think it’s only fair, Princeling. You captured me. Now you’re my captive—it has a nice symmetry to it, don’t you think?” Jagger snarled and drew back his fist to hit him, but Nikolai caught his fist in his hand. “Stop it. You’re not back on Jayron. You’re on my ship and subject to my rules.” Jagger glared back at him for long moment, his eyes flashing fire and promising retribution. He began to struggle wildly again, swearing and kicking out at Nikolai, who threw him on his back and straddled him, looking down into his face. His mate was being rebellious and defiant, and his wolf reared up in righteous anger. Glaring down at his little mate, Nikolai felt his fangs drop from his gums. Chapter Five Jagger knew almost immediately he’d made a very big mistake. As he took in Niki’s normally handsome face twisted into a snarl, his ruby eyes grown dark with fury, he stopped his thrashing, breathing hard, his chest heaving up and down. Terrified, he saw Niki bare his teeth at him again, and the sharp, white fangs that had descended from his gums. Despite himself, he shivered, remembering the incredible shift of the wolves earlier in the evening. It had truly been terrifying to see those creatures suddenly emerge in his father’s throne room. He knew Niki wouldn’t hurt him in his human form, but he wasn’t sure about this bestial creature. Survival instinct stirred within him, telling him to be quiet. He knew somehow that any further struggling would simply incite Niki to even stronger shows of domination. This same strong instinct made him lie completely still and turn his eyes downward. He twisted his head to the side to present his throat. It was difficult to do it, when every natural feeling inside him told him to protect his neck, not bare it, but some primal instinct deep within told him this was the only way to avoid an even stronger show of domination. Niki continued to growl and snarl at him for another moment and then he lowered his mouth to Jagger’s throat, licking a hot, wet tongue along the entire length to his jaw. He made a different kind of growl now, half whine, half rumble deep in his chest. If he’d been a cat, Jagger would have called it a purr. Niki’s hands began to tug impatiently at Jagger’s clothes, soon divesting him of everything and leaving him shivering and naked on the bed. The sight of his golden-brown flesh seemed to incite Nikolai even further, and he flipped Jagger over to his stomach with one strong, rough motion. Jagger knew he was about to get fucked into the mattress, but instead of being frightened, he found himself strangely excited. He was aware of Nikolai pulling at his own clothes, and then a large hand went under his stomach and pulled him up to meet a hot, wet mouth. Niki’s tongue probed his hole relentlessly, laving him with moisture as Niki got him ready. Jagger grabbed the blankets with both hands, gasping in shock. No one had ever put their mouth there before, not in his most intimate spot. He couldn’t hold back his startled gasps and screams, but the animal-like sounds he was making only seemed to increase Nikolai’s lust. He began to suck and nip at his hole, sticking his tongue further inside. Jagger found he was losing himself to mindless pleasure. Wantonly, he thrust his ass upward again to meet Niki’s mouth, craving more and more contact. He could feel his balls drawing up tight against his body, so very close to losing their load. He felt Nikolai’s cock nudge his hole, and with a wordless cry, Nikolai thrust his shaft up inside him. Jagger arched his back, tightening up and instantly a hard slap came down on his ass. “Don’t fight me! Open yourself to me,” a deep, growly voice said in his ear, and Jagger parted his legs wider, obediently pushing his ass up toward him in invitation. A kiss dropped on his back as reward, and Nikolai thrust deep inside him again and again. Niki’s hot breath fanned his ear as he lay across his back, and Jagger cried out as Niki’s huge cock pulsed over that one spot inside him that caused him to lose his mind. Nikolai thrust once more, finally taking Jagger’s throbbing shaft in his hand, pumping it hard once and then again, and Jagger lost all control, spurting uncontrollably. Nikolai joined him a moment later, filling him with his hot cum and straining against him, his breathing harsh and fast.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-alpha-s-concubine-love-slaves-of-the-alphas-2/page-12.html","bookId":1592,"book":{"id":1592,"title":"The Alpha\u0027s Concubine (Love Slaves of the Alphas #2)","description":"Storyline: The Alpha\u0027s Concubine (Love Slaves of the Alphas #2) When Nikolai Balenescu and his brother stop by a small, out of the way planet called Jayron to deliver some goods, they have no idea what’s in store for them.
