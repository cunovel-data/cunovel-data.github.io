{"id":66085,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"A staffer from the Office of Protection Research was waiting when Reacher and Neagley and Stuyvesant got back to the Treasury Building. He was standing in the reception area wearing a knitted sweater and blue pants, like he had run straight in from the family dinner table. He was about Reacher\u0027s age and looked like a university professor except for his eyes. They were wise and wary, like he had seen a few things, and heard about plenty more. His name was Swain. Stuyvesant introduced him all around and disappeared. Swain led Reacher and Neagley through corridors they hadn\u0027t used before to an area that clearly doubled as a library and a lecture room. It had a dozen chairs set facing a podium and was lined on three walls with bookshelves. The fourth wall had a row of hutches with computers on desks. A printer next to each computer.\\n\\n \"I heard what the FBI is saying,\" Swain said.\\n\\n \"You believe it?\" Reacher asked.\\n\\n Swain just shrugged.\\n\\n \"Yes or no?\" Reacher asked.\\n\\n \"I guess it\u0027s not impossible,\" Swain said. \"But there\u0027s no reason to believe it\u0027s likely. Just as likely that it\u0027s ex-FBI agents. Or current FBI agents. As an agency we\u0027re better than they are. Maybe they\u0027re trying to bring us down.\"\\n\\n \"Think we should look in that direction?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re Joe Reacher\u0027s brother, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n Reacher nodded.\\n\\n \"I worked with him,\" Swain said. \"Way back.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"He used to encourage random observations.\"\\n\\n \"So do I,\" Reacher said. \"You got any?\"\\n\\n \"My job is strictly academic,\" Swain said. \"You understand? I\u0027m purely a researcher. A scholar, really. I\u0027m here to analyze.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"This situation feels different from anything else I\u0027ve seen. The hatred is very visible. Assassinations fall into two groups, ideological or functional. A functional assassination is where you need to get rid of a guy for some specific political or economic reason. An ideological assassination is where you murder a guy because you hate him, basically. There have been plenty of attempts along those lines, over the years. I can\u0027t tell you about any of them except to say that most don\u0027t get very far. And that there\u0027s certainly always plenty of hatred involved. But usually it\u0027s well hidden, down at the conspirator level. They whisper among themselves. All we ever see is the result. But this time the hatred is right there in our face. They\u0027ve gone to a lot of trouble and taken a lot of risks to make sure we know all about it.\"\\n\\n \"So what\u0027s your conclusion?\"\\n\\n \"I just think the early phase was extraordinary. The messages? Think about the risks. Think about the energy required to minimize those risks. They put unbelievable resources into the early phase. So I have to assume they felt it was worthwhile.\"\\n\\n \"But it wasn\u0027t,\" Neagley said. \"Armstrong has never even seen any of the messages. They were wasting their time.\"\\n\\n \"Simple ignorance,\" Swain said. \"Were you aware we absolutely won\u0027t discuss threats with a protectee?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Neagley said. \"I was surprised.\"\\n\\n \"Nobody\u0027s aware,\" Swain said. \"Everybody\u0027s surprised. These guys thought they were getting right to him. So I\u0027m convinced it\u0027s personal. Aimed at him, not us.\"\\n\\n \"So are we,\" Reacher said. \"You got a specific reason?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll think I\u0027m naive,\" Swain said. \"But I don\u0027t believe anybody who works or has worked for us would have killed the other two Armstrongs. Not just like that.\"\\n\\n Reacher shrugged. \"Maybe you\u0027re naive. Maybe you aren\u0027t. But it doesn\u0027t matter. We\u0027re convinced anyway.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s your reason?\"\\n\\n \"The hyphen in the second message.\"\\n\\n \"The hyphen?\" Swain said. Then he paused. \"Yes, I see. Plausible, but a little circumstantial, wouldn\u0027t you say?\"\\n\\n \"Whatever, we\u0027re working with the assumption it was personal.\"\\n\\n \"OK, but why? Only possible answer is they absolutely hate him. They wanted to taunt him, scare him, make him suffer first. Just shooting him isn\u0027t enough for them.\"\\n\\n \"So who are they? Who hates him that bad?\"\\n\\n Swain made a gesture with his hand, like he was pushing that question aside.\\n\\n \"Something else,\" he said. \"This is a little off the wall, but I think we\u0027re miscounting. How many messages have there been?\"\\n\\n \"Six,\" Reacher said.\\n\\n \"No,\" Swain said. \"I think there have been seven.\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the seventh?\"\\n\\n \"Nendick,\" Swain said. \"I think Nendick delivered the second message, and was the third message. You see, you got here and forty-eight hours later you got to Nendick, which was pretty quick. But with respect, we\u0027d have gotten there anyway, sooner or later. It was inevitable. If it wasn\u0027t the cleaners, it had to be the tapes. So we\u0027d have gotten there. And what was waiting for us? Nendick wasn\u0027t just a delivery system. He was a message in himself. He showed what these people are capable of. Assuming Armstrong was in the loop, he\u0027d have been getting pretty shaky by that point.\"\\n\\n \"Then there are nine messages,\" Neagley said. \"On that basis, we should add in the Minnesota and the Colorado situations.\"\\n\\n \"Absolutely,\" Swain said. \"You see what I mean? Everything has fear as its purpose. Every single thing. Suppose Armstrong was in the loop all along. He gets the first message, he\u0027s worried. We get the second message, he\u0027s more worried. We trace its source, and he starts to feel better, but no, it gets even worse, because we find Nendick paralyzed with fear. Then we get the demonstration threat, he\u0027s worried some more. Then the demonstration happens, and he\u0027s devastated by how ruthless it was.\"\\n\\n Reacher said nothing. Just stared at the floor.\\n\\n \"You think I\u0027m overanalytical,\" Swain said.\\n\\n Reacher shook his head, still looking at the floor. \"No, I think I\u0027m underanalytical. Maybe. Possibly. Because what are the thumbprints about?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re a taunt of a different sort,\" Swain said. \"They\u0027re a boast. A puzzle. A tease. Can\u0027t catch me sort of thing.\"\\n\\n \"How long did you work with my brother?\"\\n\\n \"Five years. I worked for him, really. I say with him as a vain attempt at status.\"\\n\\n \"Was he a good boss?\"\\n\\n \"He was a great boss,\" Swain said. \"Great guy all around.\"\\n\\n \"And he ran random-observation sessions?\"\\n\\n Swain nodded. \"They were fun. Anybody could say anything.\"\\n\\n \"Did he join in?\"\\n\\n \"He was very lateral.\"\\n\\n Reacher looked up. \"You just said everything has fear as its purpose, every single thing. Then you said the thumbprints are a taunt of a different sort. So not everything is the same, right? Something\u0027s different.\"\\n\\n Swain shrugged. \"I could stretch it. The thumbprints induce the fear that these guys are too clever to be caught. Different sort of fear, but it\u0027s still fear.\"\\n\\n Reacher looked away. Went quiet. Thirty seconds, a whole minute.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to cave in,\" he said. \"Finally. I\u0027m going to be like Joe. I\u0027m wearing his suit. I was sleeping with his girlfriend. I keep meeting his old colleagues. So now I\u0027m going to make a lateral random off-the-wall observation, just like he did, apparently.\"\\n\\n \"What is it?\" Neagley said.\\n\\n \"I think we missed something,\" Reacher said. \"Just skated right on by it.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got all these weird images going around in my head. Like for instance, Stuyvesant\u0027s secretary doing things at her desk.\"\\n\\n \"What things?\"\\n\\n \"I think we\u0027ve got the thumbprint exactly ass-backward. All along we\u0027ve assumed they knew it was untraceable. But I think we\u0027re completely wrong. I think it\u0027s just the opposite. I think they expected it would be traceable.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because I think the thumbprint thing is exactly the same as the Nendick thing. I met a watchmaker today. He told me where squalene comes from.\"\\n\\n \"Sharks\u0027 livers,\" Neagley said.\\n\\n \"And people\u0027s noses,\" Reacher said. \"Same stuff. That gunk you wake up with in the morning is squalene. Same chemical exactly.\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"So I think our guys gambled and got unlucky. Suppose you picked a random male person aged about sixty or seventy. What are the chances he\u0027d have been fingerprinted at least once in his lifetime?\"\\n\\n \"Pretty good, I guess,\" Neagley said. \"All immigrants are printed. American born, he\u0027d have been drafted for Korea or Vietnam and printed even if he didn\u0027t go. He\u0027d have been printed if he\u0027d ever been arrested or worked for the government.\"\\n\\n \"Or for some private corporations,\" Swain said. \"Plenty of them require prints. Banks, retailers, people like that.\"\\n\\n \"OK,\" Reacher said. \"So here\u0027s the thing. I don\u0027t think the thumbprint comes from one of the guys themselves. I think it comes from somebody else entirely. From some innocent bystander. From somebody they picked out at random. And it was supposed to lead us directly to that somebody.\"\\n\\n The room went quiet. Neagley stared at Reacher.\\n\\n \"What for?\" she said.\\n\\n \"So we could find another Nendick,\" he said. \"The thumbprint was on every message, and the guy it came from was a message, just like Swain says Nendick was. We were supposed to trace the print and find the guy and find an exact replica of the Nendick situation. Some terrified victim, too scared to open his mouth and tell us anything. A message in himself. But by pure accident our guys hit on somebody who had never been printed, so we couldn\u0027t find him.\"\\n\\n \"But there were six paper messages,\" Swain said. \"Probably twenty days between the first one going in the mail and the last one being delivered to Froelich\u0027s house. So what does that mean? All the messages were prepared in advance? That\u0027s way too much planning ahead, surely.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s possible,\" Neagley said. \"They could have printed dozens of variations, one for every eventuality.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Reacher said. \"I think they printed them up as they went along. I think they kept the thumbprint available to them at all times.\"\\n\\n \"How?\" Swain asked. \"They abducted some guy and took him hostage? They\u0027ve stashed him somewhere? They\u0027re taking him everywhere with them?\"\\n\\n \"Couldn\u0027t work,\" Neagley said. \"Can\u0027t expect us to find him if he\u0027s not home.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s home,\" Reacher said. \"But his thumb isn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Nobody spoke.\\n\\n \"Fire up a computer,\" Reacher said. \"Search NCIC for the word thumb.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve got a big field office in Sacramento,\" Bannon said. \"Three agents are already mobile. A doctor, too. We\u0027ll know in an hour.\"\\n\\n This time Bannon had come to them. They were in the Secret Service conference room, Stuyvesant at the head of the table, Reacher and Neagley and Swain together on one side, Bannon alone on the other.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a bizarre idea,\" Bannon said. \"What would they do? Keep it in the freezer?\"\\n\\n \"Probably,\" Reacher said. \"Thaw it a bit, rub it down their nose, print it on the paper. Just like Stuyvesant\u0027s secretary with her rubber stamp. It\u0027s probably drying out a bit with age, which is why the squalene percentage keeps getting higher.\"\\n\\n \"What are the implications?\" Stuyvesant said. \"Assuming you\u0027re right?\"\\n\\n Reacher made a face. \"We can change one major assumption. Now I would guess they\u0027ve both got prints on file, and they\u0027ve both been wearing the latex gloves.\"\\n\\n \"Two renegades,\" Bannon said.\\n\\n \"Not necessarily ours,\" Stuyvesant said.\\n\\n \"So explain the other factors,\" Bannon said.\\n\\n Nobody spoke. Bannon shrugged.\\n\\n \"Come on,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve got an hour. And I don\u0027t want to be looking in the wrong place. So convince me. Show me these are private citizens gunning for Armstrong personally.\"\\n\\n Stuyvesant glanced at Swain, but Swain said nothing.\\n\\n \"Time is ticking by,\" Bannon said.\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t an ideal context,\" Swain said.\\n\\n Bannon smiled. \"What, you only preach to the choir?\"\\n\\n Nobody spoke.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got no case,\" Bannon said. \"I mean, who cares about a Vice President? They\u0027re nobodies. What was it, a bucket of warm spit?\"\\n\\n \"It was a pitcher,\" Swain said. \"John Nance Garner said the Vice Presidency isn\u0027t worth a pitcher of warm spit. He also called it a spare tire on the automobile of government. He was FDR\u0027s first running mate. John Adams called it the most insignificant office man had ever invented, and he was the first Vice President of all.\"\\n\\n \"So who cares enough to shoot a spare tire or an insignificant pitcher of spit?\"\\n\\n \"Let me start from the beginning,\" Swain said. \"What does a Vice President do?\"\\n\\n \"He sits around,\" Bannon says. \"Hopes the big guy dies.\"\\n\\n Swain nodded. \"Somebody else said the Vice President\u0027s job is merely about waiting. In case the President dies, sure, but more often for the nomination in his own right eight years down the track. But in the short term, what is the Vice President for?\"\\n\\n \"Beats the hell out of me,\" Bannon said.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s there to be a candidate,\" Swain said. \"That\u0027s the bottom line. His design life lasts from when he\u0027s tapped in the summer until election day. He\u0027s useful for four or five months, tops. He starts out as a pick-me-up for the campaign. Everybody\u0027s bored to death with the presidential nominees by midsummer, so the VP picks put a jolt into the campaigns. Suddenly we\u0027ve all got something else to talk about. Somebody else to analyze. We look at their qualities and their records. We figure out how well they balance the tickets. That\u0027s their initial function. Balance and contrast. Whatever the presidential nominee isn\u0027t, the VP nominee is, and vice versa. Young, old, racy, dull, northern, southern, dumb, smart, hard, soft, rich, poor.\"\\n\\n \"We get the picture,\" Bannon said.\\n\\n \"So he\u0027s there for what he is,\" Swain said. \"Initially he\u0027s just a photograph and a biography. He\u0027s a concept. Then his duties start. He\u0027s got to have campaigning skills, obviously. Because he\u0027s there to be the attack dog. He\u0027s got to be able to say the stuff the presidential candidate isn\u0027t allowed to say himself. If the campaign scripts an attack or a put-down, it\u0027s the VP candidate they get to deliver it. Meanwhile the presidential candidate stands around somewhere else looking all statesmanlike. Then the election happens and the presidential candidate goes to the White House and the VP gets put away in a closet. His usefulness is over, first Tuesday in November.\"\\n\\n \"Was Armstrong good at that kind of stuff?\"\\n\\n \"He was excellent. The truth is he was a very negative campaigner, but the polls didn\u0027t really show it because he kept that nice smile on his face the whole time. Truth is he was deadly.\"\\n\\n \"And you think he trod on enough toes to get himself assassinated for it?\"\\n\\n Swain nodded. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m working on now. I\u0027m analyzing every speech and comment, matching up his attacks against the profile of the people he was attacking.\"\\n\\n \"The timing is persuasive,\" Stuyvesant said. \"Nobody can argue with that. He was in the House for six years and the Senate for another six and barely got a nasty letter. This whole thing was triggered by something recent.\"\\n\\n \"And his recent history is the campaign,\" Swain said.\\n\\n \"Nothing way in his background?\" Bannon asked.\\n\\n Swain shook his head.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re covered four ways,\" he said. \"First and most recent was your own FBI check when he was nominated. We\u0027ve got a copy and it shows nothing. Then we\u0027ve got opposition research from the other campaign from this time around and from both of his congressional races. Those guys dig up way more stuff than you do. And he\u0027s clean.\"\\n\\n \"North Dakota sources?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" Swain said. \"We talked to all the papers up there, matter of course. Local journalists know everything, and there\u0027s nothing wrong with the guy.\"\\n\\n \"So it was the campaign,\" Stuyvesant said. \"He pissed somebody off.\"\\n\\n \"Somebody who owns Secret Service weapons,\" Bannon said. \"Somebody who knows about the interface between the Secret Service and the FBI. Somebody who knows you can\u0027t mail something to the Vice President without it going through the Secret Service office first. Somebody who knew where Froelich lived. You ever heard of the duck test? If it looks like a duck, sounds like a duck, walks like a duck?\"\\n\\n Stuyvesant said nothing. Bannon checked his watch. Took his cell phone out of his pocket and laid it on the table in front of him. It sat there, silent.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sticking with the theory,\" he said. \"Except now I\u0027m listing both of the bad guys as yours. If this phone rings and Reacher turns out to be right, that is.\"\\n\\n The phone rang right then. He had the ringer set to a squeaky little rendition of some famous classical overture. It sounded ludicrous in the somber stillness of the room. He picked it up and clicked it on. The fatuous tune died. Somebody must have said chief? because he said yeah and then just listened, not more than eight or nine seconds. Then he clicked the phone off and dropped it back in his jacket pocket.\\n\\n \"Sacramento?\" Stuyvesant asked.\\n\\n \"No,\" Bannon said. \"Local. They found the rifle.\"\\n\\n They left Swain behind and headed over to the FBI labs inside the Hoover Building. An expert staff was assembling. They all looked a lot like Swain himself, academic and scientific types dragged in from home. They were dressed like family men who had expected to remain inert in front of the football game for the rest of the day. A couple of them had already enjoyed a couple of beers. That was clear. Neagley knew one of them, vaguely, from her training stint in the labs many years before.\\n\\n \"Was it a Vaime Mk2?\" Bannon asked.\\n\\n \"Without a doubt,\" one of the techs said.\\n\\n \"Serial number on it?\"\\n\\n The guy shook his head. \"Removed with acid.\"\\n\\n \"Anything you can do?\"\\n\\n The guy shook his head again.\\n\\n \"No,\" he said. \"If it was a stamped number, we could go down under it and find enough distressed crystals in the metal to recover the number, but Vaime uses engraving instead of stamping. Nothing we can do.\"\\n\\n \"So where is it now?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re fuming it for prints,\" the guy said. \"But it\u0027s hopeless. We got nothing on the fluoroscope. Nothing on the laser. It\u0027s been wiped.\"\\n\\n \"Where was it found?\"\\n\\n \"In the warehouse. Behind the door of one of the third-floor rooms.\"\\n\\n \"I guess they waited in there,\" Bannon said. \"Maybe five minutes, slipped out at the height of the mayhem. Cool heads.\"\\n\\n \"Shell cases?\" Neagley asked.\\n\\n \"None,\" the tech said. \"They must have collected their brass. But we\u0027ve got all four bullets. The three from today are wrecked from impact on hard surfaces. But the Minnesota sample is intact. The mud preserved it.\"\\n\\n He walked to a lab bench where the bullets were laid out on a sheet of clean white butcher paper. Three of them were crushed to distorted blobs by impact. One of the three was clean. That was the one that had missed Armstrong and hit the wall. The other two were smeared with black residue from Crosetti\u0027s brains and Froelich\u0027s blood, respectively. The remains of the human tissue had printed on the copper jackets and burned on the hot surface in characteristic lacy patterns. Then the patterns had collapsed after the bullets had flown on and impacted whatever came next. The back wall, in Froelich\u0027s case. The interior hallway wall, presumably, in Crosetti\u0027s. The Minnesota bullet looked new. Its passage through the farmyard mud had scoured it clean.\\n\\n \"Get the rifle,\" Bannon said.\\n\\n It came out of the laboratory still smelling of the hot super-glue fumes that had been blown all over it in the hope of finding latent fingerprints. It was a dull, boxy, undramatic weapon. It was painted all over in factory-finish black epoxy paint. It had a short stubby bolt and a relatively short barrel made much longer by the fat suppressor. It had a powerful scope fixed to the sight mounts.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the wrong scope,\" Reacher said. \"That\u0027s a Hensoldt. Vaime uses Bushnell scopes.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, it\u0027s been modified,\" one of the techs said. \"We already logged that.\"\\n\\n \"By the factory?\"\\n\\n The guy shook his head.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so,\" he said. \"High standard, but it\u0027s not factory workmanship.\"\\n\\n \"So what does that mean?\" Bannon asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure,\" Reacher said.\\n\\n \"Is a Hensoldt better than a Bushnell?\"\\n\\n \"Not really. They\u0027re both fine scopes. Like BMW and Mercedes. Like Canon and Nikon.\"\\n\\n \"So a person might have a preference?\"\\n\\n \"Not a government person,\" Reacher said. \"Like, what would you say if one of your crime scene photographers came to you and said, I want a Canon instead of this Nikon you gave me?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d probably tell him to get lost.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly. He works with what he\u0027s got. So I don\u0027t see somebody going to their department armorer and asking him to junk a thousand-dollar Bushnell just because he prefers the feel of a thousand-dollar Hensoldt.\"\\n\\n \"So why the switch?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure,\" Reacher said again. \"Damage, maybe. If you drop a rifle you can damage a sniper scope pretty easily. But a government repairer would use another Bushnell. They don\u0027t just buy the rifles. They buy crateloads of spare parts along with them.\"\\n\\n \"Suppose they were short? Suppose the scopes got damaged a lot?\"\\n\\n \"Then they might use a Hensoldt, I guess. Hensoldts usually come with SIG rifles. You need to look at your lists again. Find out if there\u0027s anybody who buys Vaimes and SIGs for their snipers.\"\\n\\n \"Is the SIG silenced too?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Reacher said.\\n\\n \"So there you go,\" Bannon said. \"Some agency needs two types of sniper rifles, it buys Vaimes as the silenced option and SIGs as the unsilenced option. Two types of scope in the spare-parts bins. They run out of Bushnells, they start in on the Hensoldts.\"\\n\\n \"Possible,\" Reacher said. \"You should make the inquiries. You should ask specifically if anybody has fitted a Hensoldt scope to a Vaime rifle. And if they haven\u0027t, you should start asking commercial gunsmiths. Start with the expensive ones. These are rare pieces. This could be important.\"\\n\\n Stuyvesant was staring into the distance. Worry in the slope of his shoulders.\\n\\n \"What?\" Reacher asked.\\n\\n Stuyvesant focused, and shook his head. A defeated little gesture.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid we bought SIGs,\" he said, quietly. \"We had a batch of SG550s about five years ago. Unsilenced semiautomatics, as an alternative option. But we don\u0027t use them much because the automatic mechanism makes them a little inaccurate for close crowd situations. They\u0027re mostly stored. We use the Vaimes everywhere now. So I\u0027m sure the SIG parts bins are still full.\"\\n\\n The room was quiet for a moment. Then Bannon\u0027s phone rang again. The insane little overture trilled into the silence. He clicked it on and put it to his ear and said yeah and listened.\\n\\n \"I see,\" he said. Listened some more.\\n\\n \"The doctor agree?\" he asked. Listened some more.\\n\\n \"I see,\" he said, and listened.\\n\\n \"I guess,\" he said, and listened.\\n\\n \"Two?\" he asked, and listened.\\n\\n \"OK,\" he said, and clicked the phone off.\\n\\n \"Upstairs,\" he said. He was pale.\\n\\n Stuyvesant and Reacher and Neagley followed him out to the elevator and rode with him up to the conference room. He sat at the head of the table and the others stayed together toward the other end, like they didn\u0027t want to get too close to the news. The sky was full dark outside the windows. Thanksgiving Day was grinding to a close.\\n\\n \"His name is Andretti,\" Bannon said. \"Age seventy-three, retired carpenter, retired volunteer firefighter. He\u0027s got granddaughters. That\u0027s where the pressure came from.\"\\n\\n \"Is he talking?\" Neagley asked.\\n\\n \"Some,\" Bannon said. \"Sounds like he\u0027s made of slightly sterner stuff than Nendick.\"\\n\\n \"So how did it go down?\"\\n\\n \"He frequents a cop bar outside of Sacramento, from his firefighting days. He met two guys in there.\"\\n\\n \"Were they cops?\" Reacher asked.\\n\\n \"Cop-like,\" Bannon said. \"That was his description. They got to talking, they got to showing each other pictures of the family. They got to talking about what a rotten world it is, and what they would do to protect their families from it. It was gradual, he said.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"He clammed up on us for a spell, but then our doctor took a look at his hand. The left thumb has been surgically removed. Well, not really surgically. Somewhere between severed and hacked off, our guy said. But there was an attempt at neatness. Andretti stuck to his carpentry story. Our doctor said, no way was that a saw. Like, no way. Andretti seemed pleased to be contradicted, and he talked some more.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"He lives alone. Widower. The two cop-like guys had wormed an invitation home with him. They were asking him, what would you do to protect your family? Like, what would you do? How far would you go? It was all rhetorical at first, and then it got practical fast. They told him he would have to give up his thumb or his granddaughters. His choice. They held him down and did it. They took his photographs and his address book. Told him now they knew what his granddaughters looked like and where they lived. Told him they\u0027d take out their ovaries the same way they\u0027d taken off his thumb. And he was ready to believe them, obviously. He would be, right? They\u0027d just done it to him. They stole a cooler from the kitchen and some ice from the refrigerator to transport the thumb. They left and he made it to the hospital.\"\\n\\n Silence in the room.\\n\\n \"Descriptions?\" Stuyvesant asked.\\n\\n Bannon shook his head.\\n\\n \"Too scared,\" he said. \"My guys talked about Witness Protection for the whole family, but he\u0027s not going to bite. My guess is we\u0027ve got all we\u0027re going to get.\"\\n\\n \"Forensics in the house?\"\\n\\n \"Andretti cleaned it thoroughly. They made him. They watched him do it.\"\\n\\n \"What about the bar? Anybody see them talking?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll ask. But this was nearly six weeks ago. Don\u0027t hold your breath.\"\\n\\n Nobody spoke for a long time.\\n\\n \"Reacher?\" Neagley said.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"What are you thinking?\"\\n\\n He shrugged.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m thinking about Dostoyevsky,\" he said. \"I just found a copy of Crime and Punishment that I sent Joe for a birthday present. I remember I almost sent him The Brothers Karamazov instead, but I decided against it. You ever read that book?\"\\n\\n Neagley shook her head.\\n\\n \"Part of it is about what the Turks did in Bulgaria,\" he said. \"There was all kinds of rape and pillage going on. They hanged prisoners in the mornings after making them spend their last night nailed to a fence by their ears. They threw babies in the air and caught them on bayonets. They said the best part was doing it in front of the mothers. Ivan Karamazov was seriously disillusioned by it all. He said no animal could ever be so cruel as a man, so artfully, so artistically cruel. Then I was thinking about these guys making Andretti clean his house while they watched. I guess he had to do it one-handed. He probably struggled with it. Dostoyevsky put his feelings in a book. I don\u0027t have his talent. So now I\u0027m thinking I\u0027m going to find these guys and impress on them the error of their ways in whatever manner my own talent allows.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t strike me as a reader,\" Bannon said.\\n\\n \"I get by,\" Reacher said.\\n\\n \"And I would caution you against vigilantism.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a big word for a Special Agent.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever, I don\u0027t want independent action.\"\\n\\n Reacher nodded.\\n\\n \"Noted,\" he said.\\n\\n Bannon smiled. \"You done the math puzzle yet?\"\\n\\n \"What math puzzle?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re assuming that Vaime rifle was in Minnesota on Tuesday and North Dakota yesterday. Now it\u0027s here in D.C. today. They didn\u0027t fly it in, that\u0027s for damn sure, because putting long guns on a commercial flight leaves a paper trail a mile long. And it\u0027s too far to drive in the time they had. So either one guy was on his own with the Heckler amp; Koch in Bismarck while the other guy was driving all the way from Minnesota to here with the Vaime. Or if both guys were in Bismarck then they must own two Vaimes, one there, one stashed here. And if both guys were in Bismarck but they own only one Vaime, then somebody else drove it in from Minnesota for them, in which case we\u0027re dealing with three guys, not two.\"\\n\\n Nobody spoke.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going back to see Swain,\" Reacher said. \"I\u0027ll walk. It\u0027ll do me good.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll come with you,\" Neagley said.\\n\\n It was a fast half mile west on Pennsylvania Avenue. The sky was still cloudless, which made the night air cold. There were some stars visible through the faint city smog and the orange glow of street lighting. There was a small moon, far away. No traffic. They walked past the Federal Triangle and the bulk of the Treasury Building came closer. The White House roadblocks had gone. The city was back to normal. It was like nothing had ever happened.\\n\\n \"You OK?\" Neagley asked.\\n\\n \"Facing reality,\" Reacher said. \"I\u0027m getting old. Slowing up, mentally. I was pretty pleased about getting to Nendick as fast as I did, but I was supposed to get there right away. So in fact I was terrible. Same with the thumbprint. We spent hours boxing around that damn print. Days and days. We twisted and turned to accommodate it. Never saw the actual intention.\"\\n\\n \"But we got there in the end.\"\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m feeling guilty, as usual.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"I told Froelich she was doing well,\" Reacher said. \"But I should have told her to double the sentries on the roof. One guy on the edge, one in the stairwell. Might have saved her.\"\\n\\n Neagley was silent. Six strides, seven.\\n\\n \"It was her job, not yours,\" she said. \"Don\u0027t feel guilty. You\u0027re not responsible for everybody in the world.\"\\n\\n Reacher said nothing. Just walked.\\n\\n \"And they were masquerading as cops,\" Neagley said. \"They\u0027d have walked through two sentries just the same as one. They\u0027d have walked through a dozen sentries. Fact is, they did walk through a dozen sentries. More than that. They must have. The whole area was crawling with agents. There\u0027s nothing anybody could have done different. Shit happens.\"\\n\\n Reacher said nothing.\\n\\n \"Two sentries, they\u0027d both have gotten killed,\" Neagley said. \"Another casualty wouldn\u0027t have helped anybody.\"\\n\\n \"You think Bannon looks like a cop?\" Reacher asked.\\n\\n \"You think there are three guys?\" Neagley asked back.\\n\\n \"No. Not a chance. This is a two-guy thing. Bannon\u0027s missing something very obvious. Occupational hazard with a mind like his.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s he missing?\"\\n\\n \"You think he looks like a cop?\"\\n\\n Neagley smiled, briefly.\\n\\n \"Exactly like a cop,\" she said. \"He probably was a cop before he joined the Bureau.\"\\n\\n \"What makes him look like a cop?\"\\n\\n \"Everything. Every single thing. It\u0027s in his pores.\"\\n\\n Reacher went quiet. Walked on.\\n\\n \"Something in Froelich\u0027s pep talk,\" he said. \"Just before Armstrong showed up. She was warning her people. She said it\u0027s very easy to look a little like a homeless person, but very difficult to look exactly like a homeless person. I think it\u0027s the same with cops. If I put a tweed sport coat on and gray pants and plain shoes and held up a gold badge, would I look like a cop?\"\\n\\n \"A little. But not exactly.\"\\n\\n \"But these guys do look exactly like cops. I saw one of them and never thought twice. And they\u0027re in and out of everywhere without a single question.\"\\n\\n \"It would explain a lot of things,\" Neagley said. \"They were right at home in the cop bar with Nendick. And with Andretti.\"\\n\\n \"Like Bannon\u0027s duck test,\" Reacher said. \"They look like cops, they walk like cops, they talk like cops.\"\\n\\n \"And it would explain how they knew about DNA on envelopes, and the NCIC computer thing. Cops would know that the FBI networks all that information.\"\\n\\n \"And the weapons. They might filter through to second-tier SWAT teams or State Police specialists. Especially refurbished items with nonstandard scopes.\"\\n\\n \"But we know they aren\u0027t cops. You went through ninety-four mug shots.\"\\n\\n \"We know they aren\u0027t Bismarck cops,\" Reacher said. \"Maybe they\u0027re cops from someplace else.\"\\n\\n Swain was still waiting for them. He looked unhappy. Not necessarily with the waiting. He looked like a man with bad news to hear, and bad news to give. He looked a question at Reacher, and Reacher nodded, once.\\n\\n \"His name was Andretti,\" he said. \"Same situation as Nendick, basically. He\u0027s holding up better, but he\u0027s not going to talk, either.\"\\n\\n Swain said nothing.\\n\\n \"Your score,\" Reacher said. \"You made the connection. And the rifle was a Vaime with a Hensoldt scope where a Bushnell should be.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t specialize in firearms,\" Swain said.\\n\\n \"You need to tell us what you know about the campaign. Who got mad at Armstrong?\"\\n\\n There was a short silence. Then Swain looked away.\\n\\n \"Nobody,\" he said. \"What I said in there wasn\u0027t true. Thing is, I finished the analysis days ago. He upset people, for sure. But nobody very significant. Nothing out of the ordinary.\"\\n\\n \"So why say it?\"\\n\\n \"I wanted to get the FBI off their track, was all. I don\u0027t think it was one of us. I don\u0027t like to see our agency getting abused that way.\"\\n\\n Reacher said nothing.\\n\\n \"It was for Froelich and Crosetti,\" Swain said. \"They deserve better than that.\"\\n\\n \"So you\u0027ve got a feeling and we\u0027ve got a hyphen,\" Reacher said. \"Most cases I ever dealt with had stronger foundations than that.\"\\n\\n \"What do we do now?\"\\n\\n \"We look somewhere else,\" Neagley said. \"If it\u0027s not political it must be personal.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure if I can show you that stuff,\" Swain said. \"It\u0027s supposed to be confidential.\"\\n\\n \"Is there anything bad in it?\"\\n\\n \"No, or you\u0027d have heard about it during the campaign.\"\\n\\n \"So what\u0027s the problem?\"\\n\\n \"Is he faithful to his wife?\" Reacher asked.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Swain said.\\n\\n \"Is she faithful to him?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Is he kosher financially?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"So everything else is deep background. How can it hurt to let us take a look?\"\\n\\n \"I guess it can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"So let\u0027s go.\"\\n\\n They headed through the back corridors toward the library, but when they got there the phone was ringing. Swain picked it up and then handed it to Reacher.\\n\\n \"Stuyvesant, for you,\" he said.\\n\\n Reacher listened for a minute and then put the phone down.\\n\\n \"Armstrong\u0027s coming in,\" he said. \"He\u0027s upset and restless and wants to talk to everybody he can find who was there today.\"\\n\\n They left Swain in the library and walked back to the conference room. Stuyvesant came in a minute later. He was still in his golf clothes. He still had Froelich\u0027s blood on his shoes. It was splashed up on the welts, black and dry. He looked close to exhaustion. And mentally shattered. Reacher had seen it before. A guy goes twenty-five years, and it all falls apart in one terrible day. A suicide bombing will do it, or a helicopter crash or a secrets leak or a furlough rampage. Then the retributive machinery clanks into action and a flawless career spent garnering nothing but praise is trashed at the stroke of a pen, because it all has to be somebody\u0027s fault. Shit happens, but never in an official inquiry commission\u0027s final report.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to be thin on the ground,\" Stuyvesant said. \"I gave most people twenty-four hours and I\u0027m not dragging them back in just because the protectee can\u0027t sleep.\"\\n\\n Two more guys came in five minutes later. Reacher recognized one of them as a rooftop sharpshooter and the other as one of the agent screen around the food line. They nodded tired greetings and turned around and went and got coffee. Came back in with a plastic cup for everybody.\\n\\n Armstrong\u0027s security preceded him like the edge of an invisible bubble. There was radio communication with the building while he was still a mile away. There was a second call when he reached the garage. His progress into the elevator was reported. One of his personal detail entered the reception area and announced an all-clear. The other two brought Armstrong inside. The procedure was repeated at the conference room door. The first agent came in, glanced around, spoke into his cuff, and Armstrong leapfrogged past him into the room.\\n\\n He had changed into casual clothes that didn\u0027t suit him. He was in corduroy pants and a patterned sweater and a suede jacket. All the colors matched and all the fabrics were stiff and new. It was the first false note Reacher had seen from him. It was like he had asked himself what would a Vice President wear? instead of just grabbing whatever was at the front of his closet. He nodded somber greetings all around and moved toward the table. Didn\u0027t speak to anybody. He seemed awkward. The silence grew. It reached the point where it was embarrassing.\\n\\n \"How\u0027s your wife, sir?\" the sharpshooter asked.\\n\\n It was the perfect political question, Reacher thought. It was an invitation to talk about somebody else\u0027s feelings, which was always easier than talking about your own. It was collegial, in that it said we all are on the inside here, so let\u0027s talk about somebody who isn\u0027t. And it said: here\u0027s your chance to thank us for saving her ass, and yours.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s very shaken,\" Armstrong said. \"It was a terrible thing. She wants you to know how sorry she is. She\u0027s been giving me a hard time, actually. She says it\u0027s wrong of me to be putting you people at risk.\"\\n\\n It was the perfect political answer, Reacher thought. It invited only one reply: Just doing our job, sir.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s our job, sir,\" Stuyvesant said. \"If it wasn\u0027t you, it would be somebody else.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" Armstrong said. \"For being so gracious. And thank you for performing so superbly well today. From both of us. From the bottom of our hearts. I\u0027m not a superstitious guy, but I kind of feel I owe you now. Like I won\u0027t be free of an obligation until I\u0027ve done something for you. So don\u0027t hesitate to ask me. Anything at all, formal or informal, collective or individual. I\u0027m your friend for life.\"\\n\\n Nobody spoke.\\n\\n \"Tell me about Crosetti,\" Armstrong said. \"Did he have family?\"\\n\\n The sharpshooter nodded.\\n\\n \"A wife and a son,\" he said. \"The boy is eight, I think.\"\\n\\n Armstrong looked away.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" he said.\\n\\n Silence in the room.\\n\\n \"Is there anything I can do for them?\" Armstrong asked.\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll be looked after,\" Stuyvesant said.\\n\\n \"Froelich had parents in Wyoming,\" Armstrong said. \"That\u0027s all. She wasn\u0027t married. No brothers or sisters. I spoke with her folks earlier today. After I saw you at the White House. I felt I ought to offer my condolences personally. And I felt I should clear my statement with them, you know, before I spoke to the television people. I felt I couldn\u0027t misrepresent the situation without their permission, just for the sake of a decoy scheme. But they liked the idea of a memorial service on Sunday. So much so that they\u0027re going to go ahead with it, in fact. So there will be a service, after all.\"\\n\\n Nobody spoke. Armstrong picked a spot on the wall, and looked hard at it.\\n\\n \"I want to attend it,\" he said. \"In fact, I\u0027m going to attend it.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t permit that,\" Stuyvesant said.\\n\\n Armstrong said nothing.\\n\\n \"I mean, I advise against it,\" Stuyvesant said.\\n\\n \"She was killed because of me. I want to attend her service. It\u0027s the least I can do. I want to speak there, actually. I guess I should talk to her folks again.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure they\u0027d be honored, but there are security issues.\"\\n\\n \"I respect your judgment, of course,\" Armstrong said. \"But it isn\u0027t negotiable. I\u0027ll go on my own, if I have to. I might prefer to go on my own.\"\\n\\n \"That isn\u0027t possible,\" Stuyvesant said.\\n\\n Armstrong nodded. \"So find three agents who want to be there with me. And only three. We can\u0027t turn it into a circus. We\u0027ll get in and out fast, unannounced.\"\\n\\n \"You announced it on national television.\"\\n\\n \"It isn\u0027t negotiable,\" Armstrong said again. \"They won\u0027t want to turn the whole thing into a circus. That wouldn\u0027t be fair. So, no media and no television. Just us.\"\\n\\n Stuyvesant said nothing.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to her service,\" Armstrong said. \"She was killed because of me.\"\\n\\n \"She knew the risks,\" Stuyvesant said. \"We all know the risks. We\u0027re here because we want to be.\"\\n\\n Armstrong nodded. \"I spoke with the director of the FBI. He told me the suspects got away.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just a matter of time,\" Stuyvesant said.\\n\\n \"My daughter is in the Antarctic,\" Armstrong said. \"It\u0027s coming up to midsummer down there. The temperature is up to twenty below zero. It\u0027ll peak at maybe eighteen below in a week or two. We just spoke on the satellite phone. She\u0027s says it feels unbelievably warm. We\u0027ve had the same conversation for the last two years straight. I used to take it as a kind of metaphor. You know, everything\u0027s relative, nothing\u0027s that bad, you can get used to anything. But now I don\u0027t know anymore. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll ever get over today. I\u0027m alive only because another person is dead.\"\\n\\n Silence in the room.\\n\\n \"She knew what she was doing,\" Stuyvesant said. \"We\u0027re all volunteers.\"\\n\\n \"She was terrific, wasn\u0027t she?\"\\n\\n \"Let me know when you want to meet with her replacement.\"\\n\\n \"Not yet,\" Armstrong said. \"Tomorrow, maybe. And ask around about Sunday. Three volunteers. Friends of hers who would want to be there anyway.\"\\n\\n Stuyvesant was silent. Then he shrugged.\\n\\n \"OK,\" he said.\\n\\n Armstrong nodded. \"Thank you for that. And thank you for today. Thank you all. From both of us. That\u0027s really all I came here to say.\"\\n\\n His personal detail picked up the cue and moved him to the door. The invisible security bubble rolled out with him, probing forward, checking sideways, checking backward. Three minutes later a radio call came in from his car. He was secure and mobile north and west toward Georgetown.\\n\\n \"Shit,\" Stuyvesant said. \"Now Sunday is going to be a damn nightmare on top of everything else.\"\\n\\n Nobody looked at Reacher, except Neagley. They walked out alone and found Swain in the reception area. He had his coat on.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going home,\" he said.\\n\\n \"In an hour,\" Reacher said. \"First you\u0027re going to show us your files.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/without-fail-jack-reacher-6/page-15.html","bookId":2344,"book":{"id":2344,"title":"Without Fail (Jack Reacher #6)","description":"Storyline: Without Fail (Jack Reacher #6) \\n by Lee Child , Dick Hill (Narrator) \\n Skilled, cautious, and anonymous, Jack Reacher is perfect for the job: to assassinate the vice president of the United States.
