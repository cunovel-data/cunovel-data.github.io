{"id":66084,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"He peeled off his clothes. They were stiff and cold and clammy with blood. He dropped them on the closet floor and stepped into the bathroom. Set the shower going. The tray under his feet ran red and then pink and then clear. He washed his hair twice and shaved carefully. Dressed in another of Joe\u0027s shirts and another of his suits and chose the regimental tie that Froelich had bought, as a tribute. Then he went back out to the lobby.\n Neagley was waiting for him there. She had changed, too. She was wearing a black suit. It was the old Army way. If in doubt, go formal. She had a cup of coffee ready for him. She was talking to the U.S. marshals. They were a new crew. The day shift, he guessed.\n \"Stuyvesant\u0027s coming back,\" she told him. \"Then we go meet with Bannon.\"\n He nodded. The marshals were quiet around him. Almost respectful. Toward him or because of Froelich, he didn\u0027t know.\n \"Tough break,\" one of them said.\n Reacher looked away.\n \"I guess it was,\" he replied.\n Then he looked back.\n \"But hey, shit happens,\" he said.\n Neagley smiled, briefly. It was the old Army way. If in doubt, be flippant.\n Stuyvesant showed up an hour later and drove them to the Hoover Building. The balance of power had changed. Killing federal agents was a federal crime, so now the FBI was firmly in charge. Now it was a straightforward manhunt. Bannon met them in the main lobby and took them up in an elevator to their conference room. It was better than Treasury\u0027s. It was paneled in wood and had windows. There was a long table with clusters of glasses and bottles of mineral water. Bannon was conspicuously democratic and avoided the head of the table. He just dumped himself down in one of the side chairs. Neagley put herself on the same side, two places away. Reacher sat down opposite her. Stuyvesant chose a place three away from Reacher and poured himself a glass of water.\n \"Quite a day,\" Bannon said in the silence. \"My agency extends its deepest sympathies to your agency.\"\n \"You haven\u0027t found them,\" Stuyvesant said.\n \"We got a heads up from the medical examiner,\" Bannon said. \"Crosetti was shot through the head with a NATO 7.62 round. Died instantly. Froelich was shot through the throat from behind, same gun, probably. The bullet clipped her carotid artery. But I guess you already know that.\"\n \"You haven\u0027t found them,\" Stuyvesant said again.\n Bannon shook his head.\n \"Thanksgiving Day,\" he said. \"Pluses and minuses. Main minus was that we were short of personnel because of the holiday, and so were you, and so were the Metro cops, and so was everybody else. Main plus was that the city itself was very quiet. On balance it was quieter than we were shorthanded. The way it turned out we were the majority population all over town five minutes after it happened.\"\n \"But you didn\u0027t find them.\"\n Bannon shook his head again.\n \"No,\" he said. \"We didn\u0027t find them. We\u0027re still looking, of course, but being realistic we would have to say they\u0027re out of the District by now.\"\n \"Outstanding,\" Stuyvesant said.\n Bannon made a face. \"We\u0027re not turning cartwheels. But there\u0027s nothing to be gained by yelling at us. Because we could yell right back. Somebody got through the screen you deployed. Somebody decoyed your guy off the roof.\"\n He looked directly at Stuyvesant as he said it.\n \"We paid for it,\" Stuyvesant said. \"Big time.\"\n \"How did it happen?\" Neagley asked. \"How did they get up there at all?\"\n \"Not through the front,\" Bannon said. \"There was a shit-load of cops watching the front. They saw nothing, and they can\u0027t all have fallen asleep at the critical time. Not down the back alley either. There was a cop on foot and a cop in a car watching, both ends. Those four all say they saw nobody either, and we believe all four of them. So we think the bad guys got into a building a block over. Walked through the building and out a rear door into the alley halfway down. Then they skipped ten feet across the alley and got in the back of the warehouse and walked up the stairs. No doubt they exited the same way. But they were probably running, on the way out.\"\n \"How did they decoy Crosetti?\" Stuyvesant said. \"He was a good agent.\"\n \"Yes, he was,\" Reacher said. \"I liked him.\"\n Bannon shrugged again. \"There\u0027s always a way, isn\u0027t there?\"\n Then he looked around the room, the way he did when he wanted people to understand more than he was saying. Nobody responded.\n \"Did you check the trains?\" Reacher asked.\n Bannon nodded. \"Very carefully. It was fairly busy. People heading out for family dinners. But we were thorough.\"\n \"Did you find the rifle?\"\n Bannon just shook his head. Reacher stared at him.\n \"They got away carrying a rifle?\" he said.\n Nobody spoke. Bannon looked back at Reacher.\n \"You saw the shooter,\" he said.\n Reacher nodded. \"Just a glimpse, for a quarter-second, maybe. In silhouette, as he moved away.\"\n \"And you figure you\u0027ve seen him before.\"\n \"But I don\u0027t know where.\"\n \"Outstanding,\" Bannon said.\n \"There was something about the way he moved, that\u0027s all. The shape of his body. His clothing, maybe. It\u0027s just out of reach. Like the next line of an old song.\"\n \"Was he the guy from the garage video?\"\n \"No,\" Reacher said.\n Bannon nodded. \"Whatever, it doesn\u0027t mean much. Stands to reason you\u0027ve seen him before. You\u0027ve been in the same place at the same time, in Bismarck for sure, and maybe elsewhere. We already know they\u0027ve seen you. Because of the phone call. But it would be nice to have a name and face, I guess.\"\n \"I\u0027ll let you know,\" Reacher said.\n \"Your theory still standing?\" Stuyvesant asked.\n \"Yes,\" Bannon said. \"We\u0027re still looking at your ex-employees. Now more than ever. Because we think that\u0027s why Crosetti left his post. We think he saw somebody he knew and trusted.\"\n They drove the half mile west on Pennsylvania Avenue and parked in the garage and rode up to the Secret Service\u0027s own conference room. Every inch of the short journey was bitter without Froelich.\n \"Hell of a thing,\" Stuyvesant said. \"I never lost an agent before. Twenty-five years. And now I\u0027ve lost two in a day. I want these guys, so bad.\"\n \"They\u0027re dead men walking,\" Reacher said.\n \"All the evidence is against us,\" Stuyvesant said.\n \"So what are you saying? You don\u0027t want them if they\u0027re yours?\"\n \"I don\u0027t want them to be ours.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think they are yours,\" Reacher said. \"But either way, they\u0027re going down. Let\u0027s be real straight about that. They\u0027ve crossed so many lines I\u0027ve given up counting.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want them to be ours,\" Stuyvesant said again. \"But I\u0027m afraid Bannon might be right.\"\n \"It\u0027s either-or,\" Reacher said. \"That\u0027s all. Either he\u0027s right or he\u0027s wrong. If he\u0027s right, we\u0027ll know soon enough because he\u0027ll bust his balls to show us. Thing is, he\u0027ll never look at the possibility that he\u0027s wrong. He wants to be right too much.\"\n \"Tell me he\u0027s wrong.\"\n \"I think he is wrong. And the upside is, if I\u0027m wrong that he\u0027s wrong, it doesn\u0027t matter worth a damn. Because he\u0027s going to leave no stone unturned. We can absolutely rely on him. He doesn\u0027t need our input. Our responsibility is to look at what he\u0027s not looking at. Which I think is the right place to look anyway.\"\n \"Just tell me he\u0027s wrong.\"\n \"His thing is like a big pyramid balancing on its point. Very impressive, until it falls over. He\u0027s betting everything on the fact that Armstrong hasn\u0027t been told. But there\u0027s no logic in that. Maybe these guys are targeting Armstrong personally. Maybe they just didn\u0027t know you wouldn\u0027t tell him.\"\n Stuyvesant nodded.\n \"I might buy that,\" he said. \"God knows I want to. But there\u0027s the NCIC thing. Bannon was right about that. If they were outside our community, they\u0027d have pointed us toward Minnesota and Colorado personally. We have to face that.\"\n \"The weapons are persuasive too,\" Neagley said. \"And Froelich\u0027s address.\"\n Reacher nodded. \"So is the thumbprint, actually. If we really want to depress ourselves we should consider if maybe they knew the print wouldn\u0027t come back. Maybe they ran a test from this end.\"\n \"Great,\" Stuyvesant said.\n \"But I still don\u0027t believe it,\" Reacher said.\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Get the messages and take a real close look.\"\n Stuyvesant waited a beat and then stood up slowly and left the room. Came back three minutes later with a file folder. He opened it up and laid the six official FBI photographs in a neat line down the center of the table. He was still wearing his pink sweater. The bright color was reflected in the glossy surfaces of the eight-by-tens as he leaned over them. Neagley moved around the table and all three of them sat side by side so they could read the messages the right way up.\n \"OK,\" Reacher said. \"Examine them. Everything about them. And remember why you\u0027re doing it. You\u0027re doing it for Froelich.\"\n The line of photographs was four feet long, and they had to stand up and shuffle left to right along the table to inspect them all.\n You are going to die.\n Vice-President-elect Armstrong is going to die.\n The day upon which Armstrong will die is fast approaching.\n A demonstration of your vulnerability will be staged today.\n Did you like the demonstration?\n It\u0027s going to happen soon.\n \"So?\" Stuyvesant asked.\n \"Look at the fourth message,\" Reacher said. \"Vulnerability is correctly spelled.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"That\u0027s a big word. And look at the last message. The apostrophe in it\u0027s is correct. Lots of people get that wrong, you know, it\u0027s and its. There are periods at the ends, except for the question mark.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"The messages are reasonably literate.\"\n \"OK.\"\n \"Now look at the third message.\"\n \"What about it?\"\n \"Neagley?\" Reacher asked.\n \"It\u0027s a little fancy,\" she said. \"A little awkward and old-fashioned. The upon which thing. And the fast approaching thing.\"\n \"Exactly,\" Reacher said. \"A little archaic.\"\n \"But what does all this prove?\" Stuyvesant asked.\n \"Nothing, really,\" Reacher said. \"But it suggests something. Have you ever read the Constitution?\"\n \"Of what? The United States?\"\n \"Sure.\"\n \"I guess I\u0027ve read it,\" Stuyvesant said. \"A long time ago, probably.\"\n \"Me too,\" Reacher said. \"Some school I was at gave us a copy each. It was a thin little book, thick cardboard covers. Very narrow when it was shut. The edges were hard. We used to karate-chop each other with it. Hurt like hell.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"It\u0027s a legal document, basically. Historical, too, of course, but it\u0027s fundamentally legal. So when somebody prints it up as a book, they can\u0027t mess with it. They have to reproduce it exactly word for word, otherwise it wouldn\u0027t be valid. They can\u0027t modernize the language, they can\u0027t clean it up.\"\n \"Obviously not.\"\n \"The early parts are from 1787. The last amendment in my copy was the twenty-sixth, from 1971, lowering the voting age to eighteen. A span of a hundred and eighty-four years. With everything reproduced exactly like it was written down at the particular time.\"\n \"So?\"\n \"One thing I remember is that in the first part, Vice President is written without a hyphen between the two words. Same in the latest part. No hyphen. But in the stuff that was written in the middle period, there is a hyphen. It\u0027s Vice-President with a hyphen between the words. So clearly from about the 1860s up to maybe the 1930s it was considered correct usage to use a hyphen there.\"\n \"These guys use a hyphen,\" Stuyvesant said.\n \"They sure do,\" Reacher said. \"Right there in the second message.\"\n \"So what does that mean?\"\n \"Two things,\" Reacher said. \"We know they paid attention in class, because they\u0027re reasonably literate. So the first thing it means is that they went to school someplace where they used old textbooks and old style manuals that were way out of date. Which explains the third message\u0027s archaic feel, maybe. And which is why I figured they might be from a poor rural area with low school taxes. Second thing it means is they never worked for the Secret Service. Because you guys are buried in paperwork. I\u0027ve never seen anything like it, even in the Army. Anybody who worked here would have written Vice President a million times over in their career. All with the modern usage without the hyphen. They would have gotten totally used to it that way.\"\n There was quiet for a moment.\n \"Maybe the other guy wrote it,\" Stuyvesant said. \"The one who didn\u0027t work here. The one with the thumbprint.\"\n \"Makes no difference,\" Reacher said. \"Like Bannon figured, they\u0027re a unit. They\u0027re collaborators. And perfectionists. If one guy had written it wrong, the other guy would have corrected it. But it wasn\u0027t corrected, therefore neither of them knew it was wrong. Therefore neither of them worked here.\"\n Stuyvesant was silent for a long moment.\n \"I want to believe it,\" he said. \"But you\u0027re basing everything on a hyphen.\"\n \"Don\u0027t dismiss it,\" Reacher said.\n \"I\u0027m not dismissing it,\" Stuyvesant said. \"I\u0027m thinking.\"\n \"About whether I\u0027m crazy?\"\n \"About whether I can afford to back this kind of hunch.\"\n \"That\u0027s the beauty of it,\" Reacher said. \"It doesn\u0027t matter if I\u0027m completely wrong. Because the FBI is taking care of the alternative scenario.\"\n \"It could be deliberate,\" Neagley said. \"They might be misleading us. Trying to disguise their background or their education level. Throwing us off.\"\n Reacher shook his head.\n \"I don\u0027t think so,\" he said. \"This is too subtle. They\u0027d do all the usual things. Gross misspellings, bad punctuation. A hyphen between Vice and President is something you don\u0027t know from right or wrong. It\u0027s something you just do.\"\n \"What are the exact implications?\" Stuyvesant asked.\n \"Age is critical,\" Reacher said. \"They can\u0027t be older than early fifties, to be running around doing all this stuff. Up ladders, down stairs. They can\u0027t be younger than mid-forties, because you read the Constitution in junior high, and surely by 1970 every school in America had new books. I think they were in junior high at or toward the end of the period when isolated rural schools were still way behind the times. You know, maybe one-room schoolhouses, fifty-year-old textbooks, out-of-date maps on the wall, you\u0027re sitting there with all your cousins listening to some gray-haired old lady.\"\n \"It\u0027s very speculative,\" Stuyvesant said. \"It\u0027s a pyramid too, balancing on its point. Looks good until it falls over.\"\n Silence in the room.\n \"Well, I\u0027m going to pursue it,\" Reacher said. \"With Armstrong, or without him. With you, or without you. By myself, if necessary. For Froelich\u0027s sake. She deserves it.\"\n Stuyvesant nodded. \"If neither of them worked for us, how would they know to rely on an FBI scan of the NCIC reports?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Reacher said.\n \"How did they decoy Crosetti?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"How would they get our weapons?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"How did they know where M. E. lived?\"\n \"Nendick told them.\"\n Stuyvesant nodded. \"OK. But what would be their motive?\"\n \"Animosity against Armstrong personally, I guess. A politician must make plenty of enemies.\"\n Silence again.\n \"Maybe it\u0027s half and half,\" Neagley said. \"Maybe they\u0027re outsiders with animosity against the Secret Service. Maybe guys who got rejected for a job. Guys who really wanted to work here. Maybe they\u0027re some kind of nerdy law-enforcement buffs. They might know about NCIC. They might know what weapons you buy.\"\n \"That\u0027s possible,\" Stuyvesant said. \"We turn down a lot of people. Some of them get very upset about it. You could be right.\"\n \"No,\" Reacher said. \"She\u0027s wrong. Why would they wait? I\u0027m sticking by my age estimate. And nobody applies for a Secret Service job at the age of fifty. If they ever got turned down, it was twenty-five years ago. Why wait until now to retaliate?\"\n \"That\u0027s a good point too,\" Stuyvesant said.\n \"This is about Armstrong personally,\" Reacher said. \"It has to be. Think about the time line here. Think about cause and effect. Armstrong became the running mate during the summer. Before that nobody had ever heard of him. Froelich told me that herself. Now we\u0027re getting threats against him. Why now? Because of something he did during the campaign, that\u0027s why.\"\n Stuyvesant stared down at the table. Placed his hands flat on it. Moved them in small neat circles like there was a wrinkled tablecloth under them that needed flattening. Then he leaned over and butted the first message under the second. Then both of them under the third. He kept at it until he had all six stacked neatly. He scooped his file folder under the pile and closed it.\n \"OK, this is what we\u0027re going to do,\" he said. \"We\u0027re going to give Neagley\u0027s theory to Bannon. Somebody we refused to hire is more or less in the same category as somebody we eventually fired. The bitterness component would be about the same. The FBI can deal with all of that as a whole. We\u0027ve got the paperwork. They\u0027ve got the manpower. And the balance of probability is that they\u0027re correct. But we\u0027d be derelict if we didn\u0027t also consider the alternative. That they might not be correct. So we\u0027re going to spend our time looking at Reacher\u0027s theory. Because we\u0027ve got to do something, for Froelich\u0027s sake, apart from anything else. So where do we start?\"\n \"With Armstrong,\" Reacher said. \"We figure out who hates him and why.\"\n Stuyvesant called a guy from the Office of Protection Research and ordered him into the office immediately. The guy pleaded he was eating Thanksgiving dinner with his family. Stuyvesant relented and gave him two hours to finish up. Then he headed back to the Hoover Building to meet with Bannon again. Reacher and Neagley waited in reception. There was a television in there and Reacher wanted to see if Armstrong delivered on the early news. It was a half hour away.\n \"You OK?\" Neagley asked.\n \"I feel weird,\" Reacher said. \"Like I\u0027m two people. She thought I was Joe with her at the end.\"\n \"What would Joe have done about it?\"\n \"Same as I\u0027m going to do about it, probably.\"\n \"So go ahead and do it,\" Neagley said. \"You always were Joe as far as she was concerned. You may as well square the circle for her.\"\n He said nothing.\n \"Close your eyes,\" Neagley said. \"Clear your mind. You need to concentrate on the shooter.\"\n Reacher shook his head. \"I won\u0027t get it if I concentrate.\"\n \"So think about something else. Use peripheral vision. Pretend you\u0027re looking somewhere else. The next roof along, maybe.\"\n He closed his eyes. Saw the edge of the roof, harsh against the sun. Saw the sky, bright and pale all at the same time. A winter sky. Just a trace of uniform misty haze all over it. He gazed at the sky. Recalled the sounds he had been hearing. Nothing much from the crowd. Just the clatter of serving spoons, and Froelich saying thanks for stopping by. Mrs. Armstrong saying enjoy, nervously, like she wasn\u0027t quite sure what she had gotten herself into. Then he heard the soft chunk of the first silenced bullet hitting the wall. It had been a poor shot. It had missed Armstrong by four feet. Probably a rushed shot. The guy comes up the stairs, stands in the rooftop doorway, calls softly to Crosetti. And Crosetti responds. The guy waits for Crosetti to come to him. Maybe backs away into the stairwell. Crosetti comes on. Crosetti gets shot. The rooftop hutch muffles the sound from the silencer. The guy steps over the body and runs crouched straight to the lip of the roof. Kneels and fires hastily, too soon, before he\u0027s really settled, and he misses by four feet. The miss craters the brick and a small chip flies off and hits Reacher in the cheek. The guy racks the bolt and aims more carefully for the second shot.\n He opened his eyes.\n \"I want you to work on how,\" he said.\n \"How what, exactly?\" Neagley said.\n \"How they lured Crosetti away from his post. I want to know how they did that.\"\n Neagley was quiet for a moment.\n \"I\u0027m afraid Bannon\u0027s theory fits best,\" she said. \"Crosetti looked up and saw somebody he recognized.\"\n \"Assume he didn\u0027t,\" Reacher said. \"How else?\"\n \"I\u0027ll work on it. You work on the shooter.\"\n He closed his eyes again and looked at the next roof along. Back down at the serving tables. Froelich, in the last minute of her life. He recalled the spray of blood and his immediate instinctive reaction. Incoming lethal fire. Point of origin? He had glanced up and seen... what? The curve of a back or a shoulder. It was moving. The shape and the movement were somehow one and the same thing.\n \"His coat,\" he said. \"The shape of his coat over his body, and the way it draped when he moved.\"\n \"Seen the coat before?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Color?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. Not sure it really had a color.\"\n \"Texture?\"\n \"Texture is important. Not thick, not thin.\"\n \"Herringbone?\"\n Reacher shook his head. \"Not the coat we saw on the garage video. Not the guy, either. This guy was taller and leaner. Some length in his upper body. It gave the coat its drape. I think it was a long coat.\"\n \"You only saw his shoulder.\"\n \"It flowed like a long coat.\"\n \"How did it flow?\"\n \"Energetically. Like the guy was moving fast.\"\n \"He would be. Far as he knew he\u0027d just shot Armstrong.\"\n \"No, like he was always energetic. A rangy guy, decisive in his movements.\"\n \"Age?\"\n \"Older than us.\"\n \"Build?\"\n \"Moderate.\"\n \"Hair?\"\n \"Don\u0027t remember.\"\n He kept his eyes closed and searched his memory for coats. A long coat, not thick, not thin. He let his mind drift, but it always came back to the Atlantic City coat store. Standing there in front of a rainbow of choices, five whole minutes after making a stupid random decision that had led him away from the peace and quiet of a lonely motel room in La Jolla, California.\n He gave up on it twenty minutes later and gestured for the duty officer to turn the television sound up for the news. The story led the bulletin, obviously. The coverage opened with a studio portrait of Armstrong in a box behind the anchorman\u0027s shoulder. Then it cut to video of Armstrong handing his wife out of the limo. They stood up together and smiled. Started to walk past the camera. Then the tape cut to Armstrong holding up his ladle and his spoon. A smile on his face. The voice-over paused long enough for the live sound to come up: Happy Thanksgiving, everybody! Then there were seven or eight seconds taken from a little later on when the food line was really moving.\n Then it happened.\n Because of the silencer there was no gunshot, and because there was no gunshot the cameraman didn\u0027t duck or startle in the usual way. The picture held steady. And because there was no gunshot it seemed completely inexplicable why Froelich was suddenly jumping at Armstrong. It looked a little different, seen from the front. She just took off from her left foot and twisted up and sideways. She looked desperate, but graceful. They ran it once at normal speed, and then again in slow motion. She got her right hand on his left shoulder and pushed him down and herself up. Her momentum carried her all the way around and she drew her knees up and simply knocked him over with them. He fell and she followed him down. She was a foot below her maximum height when the second bullet came in and hit her.\n \"Shit,\" Reacher said.\n Neagley nodded, slowly. \"She was too quick. A quarter second slower she\u0027d still have been high enough in the air to take it in the vest.\"\n \"She was too good.\"\n They ran it again, normal speed. It was all over in a second. Then they let the tape run on. The cameraman seemed rooted to the spot. Reacher saw himself barging through the tables. Saw the other agents firing. Froelich was out of sight, on the floor. The camera ducked because of the firing, but then came up level again and started moving in. The picture wobbled as the guy stumbled over something. There were long moments of total confusion. Then the cameraman started forward again, hungry for a shot of the downed agent. Neagley\u0027s face appeared, and the picture went black. Coverage switched back to the anchorman. The anchorman looked straight at the camera and announced that Armstrong\u0027s reaction had been immediate and emphatic.\n The picture cut to tape of an outdoors location Reacher recognized as the West Wing\u0027s parking lot. Armstrong was standing there with his wife. They were both still in their casual clothes, but they had taken their Kevlar vests off. Somebody had cleaned Froelich\u0027s blood from Armstrong\u0027s face. His hair was combed. He looked resolute. He spoke in low, controlled tones, like a plain man wrestling with strong emotions. He talked about his extreme sadness that two agents had died. He extolled their qualities as individuals. He offered sincere sympathy to their families. He went on to say he hoped it would be seen that they had died protecting democracy itself, not just himself in person. He hoped their families might take some small measure of comfort from that, as well as a great deal of justified pride. He promised swift and certain retribution against the perpetrators of the outrage. He assured America that no amount of violence or intimidation could deter the workings of government, and that the transition would continue unaffected. But he finished by saying that as a mark of his absolute respect, he was remaining in Washington and canceling all engagements until he had attended a memorial service for his personal friend and protection team leader. He said the service would be held on Sunday morning, in a small country church in a small Wyoming town called Grace, where no finer metaphor for America\u0027s enduring greatness could be found.\n \"Guy\u0027s full of shit,\" the duty officer said.\n \"No, he\u0027s OK,\" Reacher said.\n The bulletin cut to first-quarter football highlights. The duty officer muted the sound and turned away. Reacher closed his eyes. Thought of Joe, and then of Froelich. Thought of them together. Then he rehearsed his upward glance once again. The curved spray of Froelich\u0027s blood, the curve of the shooter\u0027s shoulder, retreating, swinging away, swooping away. The coat flowing with him. The coat. He ran it all again, like the TV station had rerun its tape. He froze on the coat. He knew. He opened his eyes wide.\n \"Figured how yet?\" he asked.\n \"Can\u0027t get past Bannon\u0027s take,\" Neagley answered.\n \"Say it.\"\n \"Crosetti saw somebody he knew and trusted.\"\n \"Man or woman?\"\n \"Man, according to you.\"\n \"OK, say it again.\"\n Neagley shrugged. \"Crosetti saw some man he knew and trusted.\"\n Reacher shook his head. \"Two words short. Crosetti saw some type of man he knew and trusted.\"\n \"Who?\" she asked.\n \"Who can get in and out of anywhere without suspicion?\"\n Neagley looked at him. \"Law enforcement?\"\n Reacher nodded. \"The coat was long, kind of reddish-brown, faint pattern to it. Too thin for an overcoat, too thick for a raincoat, flapping open. It swung as he ran.\"\n \"As who ran?\"\n \"That Bismarck cop. The lieutenant or whatever he was. He ran over to me after I came out of the church. It was him on the warehouse roof.\"\n \"It was a cop?\"\n \"That\u0027s a very serious allegation,\" Bannon said. \"Based on a quarter-second of observation from ninety yards during extreme mayhem.\"\n They were back in the FBI\u0027s conference room. Stuyvesant had never left it. He was still in his pink sweater. The room was still impressive.\n \"It was him,\" Reacher said. \"No doubt about it.\"\n \"Cops are all fingerprinted,\" Bannon said. \"Condition of employment.\"\n \"So his partner isn\u0027t a cop,\" Reacher said. \"The guy on the garage video.\"\n Nobody spoke.\n \"It was him,\" Reacher said again.\n \"How long did you see him for in Bismarck?\" Bannon asked.\n \"Ten seconds, maybe,\" Reacher said. \"He was heading for the church. Maybe he\u0027d seen me inside, ducked out, saw me leave, turned around, got ready to go back in.\"\n \"Ten and a quarter seconds total,\" Bannon said. \"Both times in panic situations. Defense counsel would eat you up.\"\n \"It makes sense,\" Stuyvesant said. \"Bismarck is Armstrong\u0027s hometown. Hometowns are the places to look for feuds.\"\n Bannon made a face. \"Description?\"\n \"Tall,\" Reacher said. \"Sandy hair going gray. Lean face, lean body. Long coat, some kind of a heavy twill, reddish-brown, open. Tweed jacket, white shirt, tie, gray flannel pants. Big old shoes.\"\n \"Age?\"\n \"Middle or late forties.\"\n \"Rank?\"\n \"He showed me a gold badge, but he stayed twenty feet away. I couldn\u0027t read it. He struck me as a senior guy. Maybe a detective lieutenant, maybe even a captain.\"\n \"Did he speak?\"\n \"He shouted from twenty feet away. Couple dozen words, maybe.\"\n \"Was he the guy on the phone?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"So now we know both of them,\" Stuyvesant said. \"A shorter squat guy in a herringbone overcoat from the garage video and a tall lean cop from Bismarck. The squat guy spoke on the phone, and it\u0027s his thumbprint. And he was in Colorado with the machine gun because the cop is the marksman with the rifle. That\u0027s why he was heading for the church tower. He was going to shoot.\"\n Bannon opened a file. Pulled a sheet of paper. Studied it carefully.\n \"Our Bismarck field office listed all attending personnel,\" he said. \"There were forty-two local cops on the field. Nobody above the rank of sergeant except for two, firstly the senior officer present, who was a captain, and his second-in-command, who was a lieutenant.\"\n \"Might have been either one of them,\" Reacher said.\n Bannon sighed. \"This puts us in a difficult spot.\"\n Stuyvesant stared at him. \"Now you\u0027re worried about upsetting the Bismarck PD? You didn\u0027t worry too much about upsetting us.\"\n \"I\u0027m not worried about upsetting anybody,\" Bannon said. \"I\u0027m thinking tactically, is all. If it had been a patrolman out there I could call the captain or the lieutenant and ask him to investigate. Can\u0027t do that the other way around. And alibis are going to be all over the place. Senior ranks will be off-duty today for the holiday.\"\n \"Call now,\" Neagley said. \"Find out who\u0027s not in town. They can\u0027t be home yet. You\u0027re watching the airports.\"\n Bannon shook his head. \"People aren\u0027t home today for lots of reasons. They\u0027re visiting family, stuff like that. And this guy could be home already. He could have gotten through the airports easy as anything. That\u0027s the whole point, isn\u0027t it? Mayhem like we had today, multiple agencies out and looking, nobody knows each other, all he\u0027s got to do is hustle along holding his badge up and he walks straight through anywhere. That\u0027s obviously how they got into the immediate area. And out again. What\u0027s more natural in the circumstances than a cop running full speed with his badge held up?\"\n The room went quiet.\n \"Personnel files,\" Stuyvesant said. \"We should get Bismarck PD to send us their files and let Reacher look at the photographs.\"\n \"That would take days,\" Bannon said. \"And who would I ask? I might be speaking directly to the bad guy.\"\n \"So speak to your Bismarck field office,\" Neagley said. \"Wouldn\u0027t surprise me if the local FBI had illicit summaries on the whole police department, with photographs.\"\n Bannon smiled. \"You\u0027re not supposed to know about things like that.\"\n Then he stood up slowly and went out to his office to make the necessary call.\n \"So Armstrong made the statement,\" Stuyvesant said. \"Did you see it? But it\u0027s going to cost him politically, because I can\u0027t let him go.\"\n \"I need a decoy, is all,\" Reacher said. \"Better for me if he doesn\u0027t really show up. And the last thing I care about right now is politics.\"\n Stuyvesant didn\u0027t answer. Nobody spoke again. Bannon came back into the room after fifteen minutes. He had a completely neutral look on his face.\n \"Good news and bad news,\" he said. \"Good news is that Bismarck isn\u0027t the largest city on earth. Police department employs a hundred thirty-eight people, of which thirty-two are civilian workers, leaving a hundred and six badged officers. Twelve of those are women, so we\u0027re down to ninety-four already. And thanks to the miracles of illicit intelligence and modern technology we\u0027ll have scanned and e-mailed mug shots of all ninety-four of them within ten minutes.\"\n \"What\u0027s the bad news?\" Stuyvesant asked.\n \"Later,\" Bannon said. \"After Reacher has wasted a little more of our time.\"\n He looked around the room. Wouldn\u0027t say anything more. In the end the wait was a little less than ten minutes. An agent in a suit hurried in with a sheaf of paper. He stacked it in front of Bannon. Bannon pushed the pile across to Reacher. Reacher picked it up and flicked through. Sixteen sheets, some of them still a little wet from the printer. Fifteen sheets had six photographs each and the sixteenth had just four. Ninety-four faces in total. He started with the last sheet. None of the four faces was even close.\n He picked up the fifteenth sheet. Glanced across the next six faces and put the paper down again. Picked up the fourteenth sheet. Scanned all six pictures. He worked fast. He didn\u0027t need to study carefully. He had the guy\u0027s features fixed firmly in his mind. But the guy wasn\u0027t on the fourteenth sheet. Or the thirteenth.\n \"How sure are you?\" Stuyvesant asked.\n Nothing on the twelfth sheet.\n \"I\u0027m sure,\" Reacher said. \"That was the guy, and the guy was a cop. He had a badge and he looked like a cop. He looked as much like a cop as Bannon.\"\n Nothing on the eleventh sheet. Or the tenth.\n \"I don\u0027t look like a cop,\" Bannon said.\n Nothing on the ninth sheet.\n \"You look exactly like a cop,\" Reacher said. \"You\u0027ve got a cop coat, cop pants, cop shoes. You\u0027ve got a cop face.\"\n Nothing on the eighth sheet.\n \"He acted like a cop,\" Reacher said.\n Nothing on the seventh sheet.\n \"He smelled like a cop,\" Reacher said.\n Nothing on the sixth sheet. Nothing on the fifth sheet.\n \"What did he say to you?\" Stuyvesant asked.\n Nothing on the fourth sheet.\n \"He asked me if the church was secure,\" Reacher said. \"I asked him what was going on. He said some kind of big commotion. Then he yelled at me for leaving the church door open. Just like a cop would talk.\"\n Nothing on the third sheet. Or the second. He picked up the first sheet and knew instantly that the guy wasn\u0027t on it. He dropped the paper and shook his head.\n \"OK, now for the bad news,\" Bannon said. \"Bismarck PD had nobody there in plain clothes. Nobody at all. It was considered a ceremonial occasion. They were all in full uniform. All forty-two of them. Especially the brass. The captain and the lieutenant were in full dress uniform. White gloves and all.\"\n \"The guy was a Bismarck cop,\" Reacher said.\n \"No,\" Bannon said. \"The guy was not a Bismarck cop. At best he was a guy impersonating a Bismarck cop.\"\n Reacher said nothing.\n \"But he was obviously making a pretty good stab at it,\" Bannon said. \"He convinced you, for instance. Clearly he had the look, and the mannerisms.\"\n Nobody spoke.\n \"So nothing\u0027s changed, I\u0027m afraid,\" Bannon said. \"We\u0027re still looking at recent Secret Service ex-employees. Because who better to impersonate a provincial cop than some other law-enforcement veteran who just worked his whole career alongside provincial cops at events exactly like that one?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/without-fail-jack-reacher-6/page-14.html","bookId":2344,"book":{"id":2344,"title":"Without Fail (Jack Reacher #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Without Fail (Jack Reacher #6) \n by Lee Child , Dick Hill (Narrator) \n Skilled, cautious, and anonymous, Jack Reacher is perfect for the job: to assassinate the vice president of the United States.
