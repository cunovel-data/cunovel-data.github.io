{"id":78600,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"The others turned to Jenny. He\u0027s your cousin; you deal with him, their looks said.\\n\\n Jenny took another deep breath. \"You know perfectly well it will make a difference,\" she said tightly. \"If we don\u0027t get the paper house back-you know what could happen.\"\\n\\n \"And what are you going to do if we do get it? Burn it? Shred it? With them inside? Isn\u0027t that murder, or don\u0027t P.C. and Slug count?\"\\n\\n Everyone burst into speech. \"They wouldn\u0027t care about us-\" Audrey began.\\n\\n \"Just cool it,\" Dee said, standing over Zach like a lioness.\\n\\n \"Maybe they\u0027re not inside. Maybe they just took it and skipped town or something,\" Michael offered.\\n\\n Jenny gathered all her self-control, then she stood, looking at Zach directly. \"If you don\u0027t have anything useful to say, then you\u0027d better leave,\" she said.\\n\\n She saw the looks of surprise from the others. Zach didn\u0027t look surprised. He stood, his thin beaky-nosed face even more intense than usual, staring at Jenny. Then, without a word, he turned around and left.\\n\\n Jenny sat back down, feeling shaken.\\n\\n \"Good grief,\" Michael said mildly.\\n\\n \"He deserved it,\" said Dee.\\n\\n Jenny knew the point was not whether Zach had deserved it, but that Michael was surprised Jenny would give it to him.\\n\\n I\u0027ve changed, Jenny thought. She tried to push the knowledge away with a \"So what,\" but it nagged at her. She had the feeling that, deep down, she might have changed more than anybody knew yet.\\n\\n \"We have to find the paper house,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Right,\" Dee said. \"Even though I don\u0027t think so there\u0027s a chance in hell of P.C. and Slug making it all the way to the third floor where Julian is. Not with that snake and that wolf around-\"\\n\\n \"The Creeper and the Lurker,\" Audrey said with precision.\\n\\n \"-but we might as well be safe.\" A bell rang. \"See you in physiology,\" Dee added to Jenny, grabbed her empty Carbo-Force can, and ran for the art block.\\n\\n Michael brushed cookie crumbs off his lap, got up, and began the trek to the gym.\\n\\n Jenny knew she should be hurrying, too. She and Audrey had to get changed for tennis. But at the moment she really didn\u0027t care if she was late or not.\\n\\n \"Want to cut?\" she said to Audrey.\\n\\n Audrey stopped dead in the middle of reapplying her lipstick. Then she finished, snapped her compact shut, and put the lipstick away. \"What\u0027s happened to you?\" she said.\\n\\n \"Nothing-\" Jenny was beginning, when she realized that somebody was walking up to them.\\n\\n It was a guy, a senior from Jenny\u0027s world lit class. Brian Dettlinger. He looked at Audrey uncertainly, but when it was apparent she wasn\u0027t going anywhere he said hi to both of them.\\n\\n Jenny and Audrey said hi back.\\n\\n \"Just wondering,\" he said, eyeing a bumblebee hovering over a clump of Mexican lilies, \"if you had, you know, a date for the prom.\"\\n\\n Prom\u0027s over, Jenny thought stupidly. Then she realized that of course he meant senior prom.\\n\\n Audrey\u0027s chestnut eyes had widened. \"No, she doesn\u0027t,\" she said instantly, with the slight pursing of lips that brought out her beauty mark.\\n\\n \"But I have a boyfriend,\" Jenny said, astonished.\\n\\n Everyone knew that. Just as everyone knew that she and Tom had been together since elementary school, that for years people had talked about them as Tom-and-Jenny, a single unit, as if they were joined at the hip. Everyone knew that.\\n\\n \"Oh, yeah,\" Brian Dettlinger said, looking vaguely embarrassed. \"But I just thought-he isn\u0027t around much anymore, and...\"\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" Jenny said. \"I can\u0027t go.\" She knew she sounded scandalized, and that Brian didn\u0027t deserve it. He was only trying to be nice. But she was put off balance by the whole situation. Obviously she couldn\u0027t have been his first choice, since today was Monday and the prom was this Saturday, but to have been asked at all by him was a compliment. Brian Dettlinger wasn\u0027t just any scabby senior scrambling for a date at the last minute, he was captain of the football team and went with the head cheerleader. He was a star.\\n\\n \"Ma epazzo?\" Audrey said when he\u0027d gone. \"Are you nuts? That was Brian Dettlinger.\"\\n\\n \"What did you expect me to do? Go with him?\"\\n\\n \"No-well-\" Audrey shook her head, then tilted it backward, to look at Jenny appraisingly through spiky jet-black lashes. \"You have changed, you know. It\u0027s almost scary. It\u0027s like you\u0027ve blossomed, and everybody\u0027s noticed. Like a light went on inside you. Ever since-\"\\n\\n \"We have to go to P.E.,\" Jenny said abruptly.\\n\\n \"I thought you wanted to cut.\"\\n\\n \"Not anymore.\" Jenny didn\u0027t want anything else to change. She wanted to be safe, the way she was before. She wanted to be a regular junior looking forward to summer vacation in a month or so. She wanted Tom.\\n\\n \"Come on,\" she said. For a moment, just as they left, dropping iced tea bottles in the metal trash can by the English block, she had the feeling that someone was watching her. She turned her head quickly, but she couldn\u0027t see anything there.\\n\\n Tom watched her go.\\n\\n He felt bad lurking there in the shadow of the English building, behind the scarred metal pillars that held the porchlike roof up. But he couldn\u0027t make himself come out.\\n\\n He was going to lose her, and it was his own fault.\\n\\n The thing was, he\u0027d blown it already. He\u0027d screwed up. The most important thing in his life-and he hadn\u0027t even realized it was the most important thing until seventeen days ago. April 22. The day of the Game. The day Julian came and took Jenny away.\\n\\n Of course he\u0027d loved Jenny. Loving was easy. But he\u0027d never thought about what it might feel like without her, because he\u0027d always known she\u0027d be there. You don\u0027t sit around and think to yourself, \"I wonder what it would feel like if the sun didn\u0027t come up tomorrow.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d assumed things, taken things for granted. He\u0027d been lazy. That was what came of having everything handed to you on a platter. Of never having to prove yourself, of having people fawn on you because of your good looks and your hot car and your knuckleball. Of, essentially, being Tom Locke. You get to think you don\u0027t need anything.\\n\\n Then you find out how wrong you are.\\n\\n The problem was that just when he\u0027d started to realize how much he needed Jenny Thornton, she\u0027d discovered she didn\u0027t need him.\\n\\n He\u0027d seen her in that Other Place, inside that paper house that had turned real. She\u0027d been so brave and so beautiful it made his throat hurt. She\u0027d functioned absolutely perfectly without him.\\n\\n It might still have been all right-except for Julian. The Shadow Man. The guy with eyes the color of glacier pools, the guy that had kidnapped all of them because he wanted Jenny. Which had been an indisputably evil, but in Tom\u0027s view, completely understandable thing to do.\\n\\n Jenny had changed since Julian had gotten to her, Maybe the others hadn\u0027t really noticed yet, but Tom had. She was different now, even more beautiful, and just-different. There were times when she sat with a faraway look as if she were listening to things no one else could hear. Listening to Julian\u0027s voice in her mind, maybe.\\n\\n Because Julian had loved her. Julian had said it, had said all the things that Tom had never thought to mention. And Julian had the charm of the devil.\\n\\n How could Jenny resist that? Especially being as innocent as she was. Jenny might actually think that she could change Julian, or that he wasn\u0027t as evil as he seemed. Tom knew differently, but what was the use of telling her? He\u0027d seen them together, seen Julian\u0027s eyes when he looked at her. He\u0027d seen the kind of spell Julian could cast. When Julian came for Jenny next time, Tom was going to lose.\\n\\n So now all he could do was lurk in shadows, watching her. Noticing the way wisps of her hair blew over the rest of it, light as cornsilk and the color of honey in sunlight. Remembering her eyes, a dark green touched with gold. Everything about her was golden, even her skin. Funny he\u0027d never bothered to tell her that. Maybe that was what Dettlinger had been doing just now. Tom wasn\u0027t surprised that the football star had come to talk with Jenny; he was just surprised at how fast he\u0027d gone away. He wished he could have heard the conversation.\\n\\n It didn\u0027t matter. It didn\u0027t matter how many guys approached Jenny. Tom was only worried about one-and that one had better watch out.\\n\\n Tom couldn\u0027t have her anymore, but he could protect her. When Julian did come back-not if; Tom was virtually certain that he would-when Julian did come back for Jenny, and tried to play on her innocence again, Tom would be there to stop it. He didn\u0027t quite know how, but he would stop it.\\n\\n Even if it killed him.\\n\\n And if it made Jenny hate him, so be it. She\u0027d thank him someday.\\n\\n Moving quietly and purposefully, Tom followed the copper head and the golden one, stalking the girls to the gym.\\n\\n It might have been his imagination, but he had the odd feeling that something else was stalking them, too.\\n\\n They drove to the Center in two cars; Jenny and Audrey in Audrey\u0027s little red Alpha Spider, and Dee and Michael in Michael\u0027s VW Bug. Jenny braced herself as they walked inside.\\n\\n No matter how she braced, the west wall was still a shock. It was covered with pictures of Summer.\\n\\n Hundreds of them. Not just the flyers and posters.\\n\\n Summer\u0027s parents had brought in dozens of photographs, too, to show Summer from different angles, or maybe just to remind people what all this efficiency and envelope-stuffing was really about. Somebody had gotten one of the pictures blown up into a monstrous billboard-like print, so that Summer\u0027s soft blond curls spanned five feet and Summer\u0027s wisteria blue eyes stared out at them like God\u0027s.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the Tomcat?\" one of the volunteers asked Jenny. She was a college girl, and she always asked about Tom.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Jenny said briefly. The same question had been stabbing at her since lunch.\\n\\n \"If I were you, I\u0027d know. What a hunk. I\u0027d be keeping tabs on him... .\" Jenny stopped listening. As usual, she wanted to get away from the Center as soon as possible. It was a warm, earnest, busy place, full of hope and good cheer-and it was a farce.\\n\\n There was a sick feeling in Jenny\u0027s stomach as she turned to the large map on the wall. The map showed which areas had been postered and which hadn\u0027t. Jenny pretended to study it, even though she already knew where she had to go. If the Crying Girl had been P.C.\u0027s friend, she might live near him.\\n\\n She scarcely noticed as the Center door opened and one of the volunteers whispered, \"It\u0027s that psychic who called. The one from Beverly Hills.\"\\n\\n \"Will you look at that Mercedes?\" Michael said.\\n\\n Jenny turned and saw a woman with frosted blond hair, who was decorated with ropes of expensive-looking gold chains. At the same moment the psychic turned and saw her-and gasped.\\n\\n Her eyes got very large. She took several steps toward Jenny, until her Giorgio perfume overpowered Audrey\u0027s Chloe Narcisse. She stared into Jenny\u0027s face.\\n\\n \"You,\" she whispered, \"have seen them. Those from the Other Side.\"\\n\\n Jenny stood frozen. Lightning-struck.\\n\\n \"I have a message for you,\" the psychic said. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-forbidden-game-the-chase-the-forbidden-game-2/page-3.html","bookId":2435,"book":{"id":2435,"title":"The Forbidden Game: The Chase (The Forbidden Game #2)","description":"Storyline: Jenny and her friends are dealing with the aftermath of the events of the first book.
