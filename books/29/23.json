{"id":826,"no":23,"title":"Chapter 12 Bathsheba makes her choice","content":"On the same day that Bathsheba arrived home， Mr Boldwood went to apologize to her for speaking so violently the last time he had seen her. He knew nothing of her trip to Bath，and supposed she had only been to visit Liddy. But at her door he was told he could not see her，and he realized she had not forgiven him. \n \n On his way home through Weatherbury he saw the coach from Bath. It stopped at the usual place，and a soldier in a red and gold uniform jumped down. Sergeant Troy picked up his bag and was about to take the road to Bathsheba\u0027s house，when Boldwood stepped forward. \n \n ‘Sergeant Troy？I am William Boldwood. ’ \n \n ‘Indeed？’said Troy，showing little interest. \n \n ‘I want to speak to you—about two women. ’ \n \n Troy saw the heavy stick Boldwood was holding，and real－ized how determined he was. He decided it was worth being polite. \n \n ‘I\u0027ll listen with pleasure，but do speak quietly. ’ \n \n ‘Well then，I\u0027ve heard about your relationship with Fanny Robin，and I think you ought to marry her. ’ \n \n ‘I suppose I ought. Indeed，I want to，but I cannot. ’ \n \n ‘Why can\u0027t you？’ \n \n Troy was going to reply immediately，but he stopped him－self. ‘I am too poor，’he said，looking quickly at Boldwood to see if the farmer believed him. Boldwood did not notice the look. \n \n ‘I don\u0027t want to talk about right or wrong，I just want to discuss business with you. I was engaged to Miss Everdene，when you came and—’ \n \n ‘Not engaged，’said Troy. \n \n ‘More or less engaged，’insisted Boldwood. ‘If you hadn\u0027t come，she would certainly have accepted my proposal by now. Well，her position in society is so much higher than yours that you can\u0027t hope to marry her. So all I ask is that you don\u0027t bother her any more，and marry Fanny. ’ \n \n ‘Why should I？’asked Troy carelessly. \n \n ‘I\u0027ll pay you. If you leave Weatherbury today，I\u0027ll give you fifty pounds Fanny will have fifty pounds for wedding clothes，and I\u0027ll give her five hundred pounds the day she marries you. ’Boldwood\u0027s manner showed that he was a little ashamed of offering money，but he was prepared to do almost anything to prevent Troy marrying Bathsheba. \n \n Troy appeared to consider the offer. ‘It\u0027s true I like Fanny best，although she\u0027s only a maid. Fifty pounds now，you said？’ \n \n ‘Here\u0027s the money，’said Boldwood，handing the soldier a purse of gold coins. \n \n ‘Stop，listen！’said Troy in a whisper. Light footsteps could be heard on the road，coming from Bathsheba\u0027s house. \n \n ‘It\u0027s Bathsheba！She\u0027s expecting me. I must go and speak to 132 her，and say goodbye to her，as you and I have arranged. ’ \n \n ‘Why do you need to speak to her？’ \n \n ‘She\u0027ll look for me if I don\u0027t. Don\u0027t worry，you\u0027ll hear every word I say to her. It may help you in your courting，when I\u0027ve gone！Stand over there behind the tree，and listen. ’ \n \n Troy stepped forward and whistled a double note. \n \n ‘Frank，darling，is that you？’It was Bathsheba\u0027s voice. \n \n ‘Oh God！’said Boldwood，unheard behind the tree. \n \n ‘Yes，it\u0027s me，’replied Troy. \n \n ‘You\u0027rs so late，Frank，’she continued. ‘The coach arrived a long time ago！Frank，it\u0027s so lucky！There\u0027s nobody in my house except me tonight，so nobody will know about your visit. ’ \n \n ‘Excellent，’said Troy. ‘But I\u0027ll just have to cdlect my bag，so you run home and I promise to be there in ten minutes. ’ \n \n ‘Yes，Frank. ’She ran back to her house. \n \n Troy turned to Boldwood，who had stepped out from behind the tree，his face white and his whole body trembling. \n \n ‘Shall I tell her I cannot marry her？’laughed the soldier. \n \n ‘No，no，wait！I have more to say to you！whispered Boldwood，the muscles in his face strangely out of control. \n \n ‘Now，’said Troy，‘you see my problem. I can\u0027t marry them both. But I have two reasons for choosing Fanny. First，I like her best，I think，and second，you\u0027re paying me for it. ’ \n \n At that moment Boldwood lost control. He attacked Troy fiercely，holding his neck with botn hands. \n \n ‘Wait，’gasped Troy，who had not expected this，‘let me breathe！If you kill me，you injure the woman you love！’ \n \n ‘What do you mean？’cried the farmer. ‘I should kill you like a dog！’But he let go of Troy\u0027s neck，and listened. \n \n ‘You heard how Bathsheba loves me and expects me to visit her tonight Soon the whole village will know this. The only way to save her good name，and her position in Weatherbury，is for me to marry her. ’ \n \n ‘True，true，’agreed Boldwood after a pause. ‘Troy，marry her！Poor，weak woman！She must love you madly to give herself so completely to you！’ \n \n ‘But what about Fanny？’asked the soldier cleverly. \n \n ‘Don\u0027t desert her，Troy，I beg you！I don\u0027t mean Fanny，I\u0027m speaking of Bathsheba！How can I persuade you？I know！I\u0027ll pay you five hundred pounds on the day you marry Bathsheba！’ \n \n Troy was secretly shocked at Boldwood\u0027s wild offer. \n \n ‘And I\u0027ll receive something now as well？’he asked. \n \n ‘Yes，all the money I have with me！’He counted the coins in his pocket. ‘Twenty－one pounds—it\u0027s all for you！’ \n \n ‘Give me the money，and we\u0027ll go to her house. I\u0027ll ask her to marry me. Of course I won\u0027t say anything about the money. ’ \n \n They went along the road to the farmhouse，and Boldwood waited outside while Troy entered. He returned in a moment with a piece cut out of a Bath newspaper. \n \n ‘Here，read this first，’he said，smiling. And Boldwood read： \n \n MARRIAGES：On the 17th，in Bath，Frank Troy，Sergeant，to Bathsheba Everdene of Weatherbury. \n \n The paper fell from Boldwood\u0027s hands，as the soldier began to laugh. ‘Fifty pounds to marry Fanny. Twenty－one pounds not to marry Fanny，but Bathsheba. And now you see I\u0027m already Bathsheba\u0027s husband. You\u0027re a fool，Boldwood. Although I may be a bad man，I\u0027d never bribe anyone to mar-ry，as you\u0027ve tried to. And Fanny？She left me long ago，and I don\u0027t know where she is. I\u0027ve searched everywhere for her. Now take your money back！I don\u0027t want it！’and Troy threw the gold coins into the road. \n \n ‘You black－hearted dog！I\u0027ll punish you one day，remember that！’cried the broken man. Troy laughed loudly as he closed Bathsheba\u0027s front door. \n \n Through the whole of the long night that followed，Boldwood\u0027s dark figure could be seen walking over the hills of Weatherbury like a ghost. \n \n Just before the clock struck five the next morning，Gabriel and Coggan were walking to the hayfields past their mistress\u0027s house，when they saw a surprising sight. Bathsheba\u0027s bedroom window was open，and looking out of it was a hand-some man，with his red jacket undone. It was Sergeant Troy. \n \n ‘She\u0027s married him！’whispered Coggan. Gabriel said nothing，but he felt so ill that he had to rest on the gate for a moment. He thought with pity of her future，as he knew her marriage to Troy could not be happy for long. \n \n ‘Good morning，friends！’shouted Troy cheerfully to the men. \n \n ‘We must be polite to him，’whispered Coggan，‘if he\u0027s married the mistress. ’ \n \n ‘Good morning，Sergeant Troy，’said Gabriel miserably. \n \n ‘Now that I\u0027ve left the army，I\u0027ll soon be down in the fields with you again，’said Troy lightly. ‘My new position won\u0027t change that，and I\u0027ll be friendly with you all，just as before. Drink to my health，men. ’And he threw a coin towards Gabriel，who refused to pick it up. Coggan，however，put it in his pocket. \n \n As they went on their way，they noticed Mr Boldwood riding past them. Gabriel forgot his own sadness when he saw the bitterness and deep despair on the farmer\u0027s face. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/1015/30559.html","bookId":29,"book":{"id":29,"title":"远离尘嚣 Far from the madding crowd","description":"简介： 《远离尘嚣（Far from the madding crowd）》发表于一八七四年，是哈代第一部成功的长篇，也是他此后一系列以威塞克斯乡村为背景的优秀长篇小说的第一部。这些小说包括《还乡记》（1878）、《卡斯特桥市长》（1886）、《德伯家的苔丝》（1891）以及《无名的裘德》（1896...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201404/21/10-06-12-99-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/1015","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM"}}
