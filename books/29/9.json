{"id":812,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 5 Bathsheba sends a valentine","content":"When Bathsheba first appeared at the weekly Caster－ bridge market，where farmers bought and sold their wheat and animals，she caused a sensation. Men\u0027s heads turned to look at her，the only woman there. Like any woman，she was happy to be admired，but she was also deter- mined to sell her wheat at a good price，and to do business with the other farmers like a man. There was one farmer， however，who did not seem to notice her，and this annoyed her a little. It was Mr Boldwood. \n \n One Sunday afternoon，on the thirteenth of February，Bathsheba and Liddy were in the sitting－room together. It was a dull，cold day，and they were both very bored. \n \n ‘Have you ever tried to discover who you\u0027re going to marry，miss，’asked Liddy，‘with a Bible and a key？’ \n \n ‘I don\u0027t believe in such foolish games，Liddy. ’ \n \n ‘Well，some people believe it works. ’ \n \n ‘All right，let\u0027s try it，’said Bathsheba suddenly，jumping up from her seat. Together they opened the big family Bible and put a key on a page. \n \n ‘Now you think of someone you could marry，miss，’said Liddy，‘then read aloud the words on that page，and if the Bible moves，perhaps you\u0027ll marry him. ’ \n \n Bathsheba read the words，holding the Bible. As they watched，the Bible turned in her hands，and Bathsheba blushed. \n \n ‘Who were you thinking of？’asked Liddy curiously. \n \n ‘I\u0027m not going to tell you，’answered her mistress. \n \n ‘By the way，did you notice Mr Boldwood in church this morning？’asked Liddy，making it very clear who she was thinking of. ‘He didn\u0027t turn his head once to look at you！’ \n \n ‘Why should he？’replied Bathsheba，annoyed. ‘I didn\u0027t ask him to look at me. ’ \n \n ‘Oh no. But everybody else in church was looking at you. ’ \n \n Bathsheba did not reply to this. After a few minutes she said，‘Oh，I nearly forgot the valentine card I bought yester－ day！’ \n \n ‘A valentine！Who\u0027s it for，miss？Farmer Boldwood？’ \n \n ‘No，of course not. It\u0027s for one of the village children，that sweet little boy of Jan Coggan\u0027s. I\u0027ll write the address on the envelope now，and we\u0027ll post it today. ’ \n \n ‘What fun it would be to send it to that silly old Bold－ wood！’laughed Liddy. \n \n Bathsheba paused to consider. It was certainly a little de－ pressing that the wealthiest and most important man in the area did not seem to admire her，as all the other men did. \n \n ‘We\u0027ll throw a coin to decide，’she said lightly. ‘No，we shouldn\u0027t play with money on a Sunday. I know，we\u0027ll throw this book. If it comes down open，I\u0027ll send the valentine to Jan\u0027s son. If it comes down shut，I\u0027ll send it to Boldwood. ’ The little book went up in the air and came down shut. Bathsheba immediately picked up her pen and wrote Bold-wood\u0027s address on the envelope. \n \n ‘Now we need a seal，’she said. ‘Look for an interesting one，Liddy. Ah，let\u0027s use this one. I can\u0027t remember what it says，but I know it\u0027s funny. ’When she had sealed the enve－lope，Bathsheba looked closely at the words left by the seal： \n \n ‘MARRY ME’. \n \n ‘Just right！’she cried. ‘That would make even a vicar laugh！’And so the valentine was sent，not for love，but as a joke. Bathsheba had no idea of the effect it would have. \n \n It arrived at Mr Boldwood\u0027s house on the morning of St Valentine\u0027s Day，14th February He was puzzled，but strangely excited by it He had never received one before，and all day he thought about it. Who could the woman be who admired him so much that she sent him a valentine？He kept on looking at it，until the words on the large red seal danced in front of his tired eyes，and he could no longer read them. But he knew what they said： \n \n ‘MARRY ME’. \n \n The valentine had destroyed the peaceful routine of Bold－wood\u0027s life. That night he dreamed of the unknown woman，and when he woke up very early，the first thing he saw was the valentine，with its message in red，on the table by his bed. \n \n ‘Marry me，’he repeated to himself. He was too restless to sleep any more so he went out for a walk. He watched the sun rise over the snowy fields，and on his way home he met the postman，who handed him a letter. Boldwood took it quickly and opened it，thinking it could be from the sender of the valentine. \n \n ‘I don\u0027t think it\u0027s for you，sir，’said the postman. ‘I think it\u0027s for your shepherd. ’ \n \n Boldwood looked at the address on the envelope： \n \n To the new shepherd， \n \n Weatherbury Farm， \n \n Near Casterbridge. \n \n ‘Oh，what a mistake！It isn\u0027t mine，or my shepherd\u0027s. It must be for Miss Everdene\u0027s shepherd. His name is Gabriel Oak. ’ \n \n At that moment he noticed a figure in a distant field. \n \n ‘Ah，there he is now，’Boldwood added. ‘I\u0027ll take the let－ ter to him myself. ’The shepherd started walking towards the malthouse，and Boldwood followed him，holding the letter. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/1015/30545.html","bookId":29,"book":{"id":29,"title":"远离尘嚣 Far from the madding crowd","description":"简介： 《远离尘嚣（Far from the madding crowd）》发表于一八七四年，是哈代第一部成功的长篇，也是他此后一系列以威塞克斯乡村为背景的优秀长篇小说的第一部。这些小说包括《还乡记》（1878）、《卡斯特桥市长》（1886）、《德伯家的苔丝》（1891）以及《无名的裘德》（1896...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201404/21/10-06-12-99-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/1015","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM"}}
