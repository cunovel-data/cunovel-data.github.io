{"id":838,"no":35,"title":"Chapter 18 Mr Boldwood\u0027s Christmas party","content":"For months Weatherbury people had been discussing the party that Mr Boldwood was going to give just before Christmas，and now the day had finally arrived. Bathsheba was getting ready for it. \n \n ‘I\u0027m upset，Liddy，it\u0027s foolish of me，I know，’she said. ‘I wish I didn\u0027t have to go to the party. I haven\u0027t spoken to Mr Boldwood since the autumn，when I promised to see him at Christmas，so I\u0027ll have to go. My black silk dress，please. ’ \n \n ‘Surely you don\u0027t need to wear black tonight，ma\u0027am？You\u0027ve been a widow for fourteen months now. That\u0027s a long time. ’ \n \n ‘No，if I wear a bright dress，people will say I\u0027m encouraging Mr Boldwood. How do I look，Liddy？’ \n \n ‘I\u0027ve hardly ever seen you look so lovely，ma\u0027am. ’ \n \n ‘I rish offending him if I don\u0027t go. Oh，I wish I could have continued as I\u0027ve been for the last year or so，with no hopes or fears，and no pleasures and no sadness. ’ \n \n ‘If Mr Boldwood asked you to run away with him，what would you say，ma\u0027am？’said Liddy with a smile. \n \n ‘Now，Liddy，no joking. This is far too serious. I won\u0027t marry anyone for a long time. Get my cloak. It\u0027s time to go. ’ \n \n At the same time，in his farmhouse，Boldwood was also dressing He was trying on a new coat which had just been delivered. Tonight he wanted to look his best. \n \n Just then Gabriel entered，to report on farm business. \n \n ‘Oh，Oak，’said Boldwood. ‘You\u0027re invited to the party tonight，of course. ’ \n \n ‘I\u0027ll try to come，if I\u0027m not too busy，’said Gabriel quietly. ‘I\u0027m glad to see you looking happier，sir. ’ \n \n ‘Yes，I confess I\u0027m cheerful tonight. But my happiness depends on a hope. Oak，my hands are shaking. Could you help me with the buttons on this coat？’And as Gabriel came forward to help，he went on feverishly，‘Oak，does a woman keep her promise to become engaged？You know women better than I do—tell me. ’ \n \n ‘I don\u0027t think I understand women well at all. But if she wants to put right a mistake，she may keep a promise like that. ’ \n \n ‘I think she will，’whispered Boldwood. ‘She says she can think of me as a husband seven years after Troy\u0027s disappear-ance. ’ \n \n ‘Seven years，’said Gabriel，shaking his head. ‘A long time. ’ \n \n ‘But it isn\u0027t seven years！’answered Boldwood impatiently. ‘It\u0027s only five years，nine months and a few days now！’ \n \n ‘Don\u0027t build your hopes on her promise，sir. Remember，she disappointed you once. And she\u0027s young. ’ \n \n ‘She never promised me that first time，so she\u0027s never broken her promise to me yet. I trust her to keep her word. But let\u0027s talk business for a moment，Oak. You work so hard as my farm manager that I want you to have a larger share of the profits. I know a little about your secret. You have warm feelings for her too，but you\u0027ve let me succeed in courting her！I want to show you how grateful I am for that. ’ \n \n ‘Oh，that\u0027s not necessary，thank you，’said Gabriel hurriedly. ‘I must get used to my disappointment as other men have. ’He left，rather worried by Boldwood\u0027s strange manner. \n \n Outside the front door of Boldwood\u0027s house a group of men were talking quietly. \n \n ‘Sergeant Troy was seen in Casterbridge this afternoon，’said Billy Smallbury. ‘His body was never found，you know，neighbours. ’ \n \n ‘Should we tell the mistress？’asked Laban Tall. ‘Poor woman！What a mistake she made in marrying him！’ \n \n Just then Boldwood came out and walked to the gate. He did not notice the men，who were standing in the darkness. \n \n ‘I hope to God she\u0027ll come！’he whispered. ‘Oh，my darling，my darling，why do you make me wait like this！’ \n \n They all heard his words clearly. The sound of wheels came from the road，and Bathsheba arrived. Boldwood took her into the house，and the door closed behind them. \n \n ‘I didn\u0027t realize he was still in love with her！’said Billy. \n \n ‘Poor Mr Boldwood，the news will be hard for him，’said Jan Coggan. ‘We\u0027ll have to tell the mistress her husband\u0027s still alive. We\u0027ll go in and find the right moment to speak to her. ’ \n \n But the right moment never came. Bathsheba had planned to stay at the party for only an hour，and she was in fact preparing to leave when Boldwood found her alone in an upstairs room. \n \n ‘Mrs Troy，you can\u0027t go！’he said wildly. ‘We\u0027ve only just begun！’ \n \n ‘I\u0027d like to go now. I think I\u0027ll walk home. ’ \n \n ‘You know what I want to say to you？’Bathsheba looked silently at the floor. ’You do give it？’he said eagerly. \n \n ‘Give what？’she asked，althoug she knew well what he meant. \n \n ‘Your promise！Just a business arrangement between two sensible people who no longer think of love. To marry me in five to six years！You owe it to me！’ \n \n ‘I have no feeling in that matter at all，’she replied，hesitating. ‘But if I must，I promise—if I\u0027m really a widow. ’ \n \n ‘You\u0027ll marry me in five and three-quarter years’time？’ \n \n ‘Let me think！I\u0027ll marry nobody else. Oh，I don\u0027t know！Is Frank really dead？Perhaps I should ask a lawyer！’ \n \n ‘Say the words，my dear one，and I won\u0027t speak about it any more. A long engagement，then marriage—Oh Bathsheba！Promise yourself to me！’he begged wildly，forgetting his cool，businesslike manner. ‘I\u0027ve loved you so much and for so long！’ \n \n ‘Very well，’she said after a pause，‘I\u0027ll marry you six years from now if we\u0027re both alive and if my husband doesn\u0027t return. ’ \n \n ‘Then wear this ring for me. ’Boldwood took from his pocket a diamond engagement ring，and held it out to her. \n \n ‘No，no，I can\u0027t，I don\u0027t want anyone to know！’ \n \n ‘Just wear it tonight，to please me！’Bathsheba could say no more，and weakly let him put it on her finger. He left her. \n \n In a few minutes she was calmer. She put on her cloak and went downstairs. She paused at the foot of the stairs. Bold-wood was standing near the fire，and he had just noticed that a group of villagers were whispering among themselves. \n \n ‘What\u0027s the matter，men？’he asked cheerfully. ‘Is any-body engaged or married，born or dead？Tell us the news，Tall. ’ \n \n ‘I wish somebody was dead，’replied Laban Tall in a whisper. \n \n ‘What was that，Tall？’asked Boldwood. ‘Speak out，if you have anything to say. ’ \n \n At that moment there was a knock on the front door. One of the men opened it. ‘A stranger wants to see Mrs Troy，’he said. \n \n ‘Ask him to come in，’said Boldwood. \n \n The message was given，and Troy，wrapped up to his eyes in the cloak，stood in the doorway. Those who knew he was in the area recognized him immediately. Boldwood did not. He said，‘Come in，stranger，and have a Christmas drink with us！’ \n \n Troy entered，threw off his cloak and looked Boldwood in the face. But it was only when he laughed that Boldwood recognized the man who had destroyed his hope and happiness once and was about to do it again. \n \n Troy turned to Bathsheba. She had dropped miserably on to the lowest stair. Her mouth was blue and dry，her eyes empty and staring. He said，‘Bathsheba，I\u0027ve come here for you！’She did not reply. ‘Come home with me，do you hear！’He went towards her. \n \n A strange，thin voice，full of despair，came from the fire-place. ‘Bathsheba，go with your husband！’said Boldwood. \n \n She did not move，and when Troy stretched out hi","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/1015/30571.html","bookId":29,"book":{"id":29,"title":"远离尘嚣 Far from the madding crowd","description":"简介： 《远离尘嚣（Far from the madding crowd）》发表于一八七四年，是哈代第一部成功的长篇，也是他此后一系列以威塞克斯乡村为背景的优秀长篇小说的第一部。这些小说包括《还乡记》（1878）、《卡斯特桥市长》（1886）、《德伯家的苔丝》（1891）以及《无名的裘德》（1896...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201404/21/10-06-12-99-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/1015","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM"}}
