{"id":830,"no":27,"title":"Chapter 14 Bathsheba discovers the truth","content":"Summer turned into autumn and one Saturday evening in October Bathsheba and her husband were riding home from Casterbridge market. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Yes，if it hadn\u0027t rained so hard，I\u0027d have won two hundred pounds easily，my love，’Troy was saying. ‘The horse I put my money on fell over in the mud，you see. Such bad luck！’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘But Frank，’said Bathsheba miserably，‘do you realize you\u0027ve lost more than a hundred pounds in a month with this awful horse-racing？It\u0027s foolish of you to spend my money like that！You\u0027ll promise not to go to the next race，on Monday，won\u0027t you？’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘It doesn\u0027t matter whether I go or not. I\u0027ve already put money on an excellent horse in the Monday race. Don\u0027t cry，Bathsheba！If I\u0027d known you were so cautious，I\u0027d never have—’ \\n\\n \\n\\n He did not finish what he was saying. Just then they noticed a woman walking towards them. Although it was almost dark，they could see that she was poorly dressed. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Please，sir，do you know what time the Casterbridge workhouse closes？’she asked in a voice of extreme sadness. \\n\\n \\n\\n Troy jumped in surprise，but kept his face turned away from her before replying，‘I don\u0027t know. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n When the woman hear him speak，and looked up to his face，her expression showed both pain and happiness. She gave a cry，and fell to the ground，unconscious. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Oh poor thing！’cried Bathsheba. ‘I\u0027ll help her！’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘No，stay on your horse，and take mine！’ordered Troy，jumping down. ‘Take the horses to the top of the hill. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Bathsheba obeyed，and moved away. Troy lifted up the woman. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I thought you were far away，or dead！’he told her，in a strangely gentle voice. ‘Why didn\u0027t you write to me，Fanny？’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I was afraid to. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Have you any money？No？Here\u0027s all I have，it\u0027s not much. I can\u0027t ask my wife for any more at the moment. ’The woman said nothing. ’Listen，’continued Troy，‘I\u0027ll have to leave you now. You\u0027re going to the Casterbridge workhouse？Well，stay there for tonight and tomorrow anyway，but I\u0027ll find somewhere better for you. I\u0027ll meet you on Monday morning at ten o\u0027clock on the bridge just outside town. I\u0027ll bring you all the money I can. Goodbye！’ \\n\\n \\n\\n At the top of the hill Bathsheba turned and saw the woman walking slowly on towards Casterbridge. Troy soon caught up with his wife. He looked very upset. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Who is that woman？Bathsheba looked closely into his face. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘She\u0027s not important to either of us，’he replied coldly. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I think you know her，’Bathsheba went on. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I don\u0027t care what you think！’he answered，and they continued their ride in silence. \\n\\n \\n\\n The two miles to Casterbridge seemed a very long way to the woman，who was tired and ill. Sometimes she walked，sometimes she rested a little，beside the road. All through the night her eyes were fixed on the lights of Casterbridge，the end of her journey. At six o\u0027clock the next morning she finally fell in front of the door of the workhouse，and the people there took her in. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bathsheba and her husband did not speak much that evening，or the following day. But on Sunday evening Troy said suddenly，‘Bathsheba，could you let me have twenty pounds？I need it. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Ah！’she said sadly，‘for the races tomorrow. Oh，Frank，only a few weeks ago you said I was far sweeter than all your other pleasures！Now won\u0027t you stop risking money on horses，which is more a worry than a pleasure？Say yes to your wife，Frank，say yes！’Her beautiful face would have persuaded most men，including Troy if he had not been married to her，but he no longer loved her enough to agree to anything she wanted. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Well，the money isn\u0027t for racing anyway，’he said. ‘Don\u0027t keep me short of money，Bathsheba，or you\u0027ll be sorry. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I\u0027m sorry already，’she replied，‘sorry that our love has come to an end. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Love always ends after marriage. I think you hate me. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘No，not you. I only hate your faults. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Then why not help me to improve？Come，let\u0027s be friends. Just give me the twenty pounds. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Well，here\u0027s the money. Take it. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Thank you. I expect I\u0027ll be away before breakfast tomor-row. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Must you go，Frank？Stay with me！There was a time when you used to call me darling. Now you don\u0027t care how I spend my time. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I must go，’said Troy，taking out his watch. He opened the back of the watch case，and Bathsheba，who happened to be looking，saw that there was a curl of hair hidden inside. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Oh Frank！’she gasped. ‘A woman\u0027s hair！Whose is it？’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Troy closed the watch immediately and replied carelessly，‘Why，yours of course. I\u0027d quite forgotten I had it. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘You\u0027re lying，Frank. It\u0027s yellow hair. Mine is darker. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Well，all right，if I must tell you，it\u0027s the hair of a young woman I was going to marry before I met you. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Tell me her name！Is she married？’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I can\u0027t tell you her name，but she\u0027s single. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Is she alive？Is she pretty？’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Yes to both questions. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘How can she be pretty，poor thing，with hair that colour？’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Her hair has been admired by everybody who\u0027s seen her. It\u0027s beautiful hair！Don\u0027t be jealous，Bathsheba！You shouldn\u0027t have married me if you didn\u0027t trust me！’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘This is all I get for loving you so much！’cried Bathsheba bitterly. ‘I would have died for you when I married you，and now you laugh at my foolishness in marrying you！But you\u0027ll burn that hair，won\u0027t you，Frank，to please me？’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Troy only answered，‘I have a duty to someone in my past. Mistakes were made which I must put right. That\u0027s more important than my relationship with you. If you\u0027re sorry you married me，well，so am I！’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Frank，I\u0027m only sorry if you love another woman more than me，’said Bathsheba in a trembling voice. ‘You like the woman with that pretty hair. Yes，it is pretty！Was she the woman we met on the road last night？’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Well，yes. Now you know the truth，I hope you\u0027re happy. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘You haven\u0027t told me everything. Tell me the whole truth，’she said，looking bravely into his face. ‘I never thought I\u0027d beg a man to do anything，but my pride has all gone！’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Don\u0027t be so desperate！’said Troy crossly. He left the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bathsheba was in deep despair. She knew that she had lost her independence as a woman，which she had been so proud of. She hated herself for falling in love so easily with her hand-some husband，who，she now realized，could not be trusted. \\n\\n \\n\\n The next morning Troy left the house early. Bathsheba was walking in her garden，when she noticed Gabriel Oak and Mr Boldwood deep in conversation in the road. They called to Joseph Poorgrass，who was picking apples，and soon he came along the path to Bathsheba\u0027s house. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Well，what\u0027s the message，Joseph？’she asked，curious. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I\u0027m afraid Fanny Robin\u0027s dead，ma\u0027am. Dead in the Casterbridge workhouse. \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘No！Why？What did she die from？’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘I don\u0027t know，ma\u0027am，but she was never very strong. Mr Boldwood is sending a cart to bring her back to be buried here. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Oh，I won\u0027t let Mr Boldwood do that！Fanny was my uncle\u0027s maid，and mine too How very sad to die in a work-house！Tell Mr Boldwood that you will drive my new cart over to Casterbridge this afternoon to fetch her body. And Joseph，put flowers on the cart for poor Fanny. How long was she in the workhouse？’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Only a day，ma\u0027am. She arrived，ill and exhausted，on Sunday morning. She came on foot through Weatherbury. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n The colour left Bathsheba\u0027s face at one. ‘Along the road from Weatherbury to Casterbridge？’she asked eagerly. ‘When did she pass Weatherbury？’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Last Saturday night it was，ma\u0027am. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Thank you，Joseph，you may go. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n Later that afternoon Bathsheba asked Liddy，‘What was the colour of poor Fanny Robin\u0027s hair？I only saw her for a day or two. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘She used to keep it covered，but it was lovely golden hair，ma\u0027am. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Her young man was a soldier，wasn\u0027t he？’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Yes，and Mr Troy knows him well. ’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘What？Mr Troy told you that？’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘Yes. One day I asked him if he knew Fanny\u0027s young man，and he said he knew him as well as he knew himself！’ \\n\\n \\n\\n ‘That\u0027s enough，Liddy！’said Bathsheba，her anxiety mak-ing her unusually cross. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/1015/30563.html","bookId":29,"book":{"id":29,"title":"远离尘嚣 Far from the madding crowd","description":"简介： 《远离尘嚣（Far from the madding crowd）》发表于一八七四年，是哈代第一部成功的长篇，也是他此后一系列以威塞克斯乡村为背景的优秀长篇小说的第一部。这些小说包括《还乡记》（1878）、《卡斯特桥市长》（1886）、《德伯家的苔丝》（1891）以及《无名的裘德》（1896...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201404/21/10-06-12-99-1.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/1015","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:11 AM"}}
