Lucky to have jacks on our nancy five days before the pull?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, lucky,\" Pierce said. \"What if Willy blew?\u0027 He\u0027d tell them we knocked over the London Bridge Terminus.\"\\n\\n \"I doubt he\u0027d blow so much, right off. He\u0027d likely tickle them for a bigger push.\" An informant was in the habit of letting out information bit by bit, with a bribe from the police at each step.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Pierce said, \"but we must take the chance that he did. Now, that\u0027s why we are lucky.\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the luck, then?\" Agar said.\\n\\n \"In the fact that London Bridge is the only station in the city with two lines operating from it. The South Eastern, and the London \u0026 Greenwich.\"\\n\\n \"Aye, that\u0027s so,\" Agar said, with a puzzled look.\\n\\n \"We need a bone nose to blow on us,\" Pierce said.\\n\\n \"You giving the crushers a slum?\"\\n\\n \"They must have something to keep them busy,\" Pierce said. \"In five days\u0027 time, we\u0027ll pull the peters on that train, and I don\u0027t want the crushers around to watch.\"\\n\\n \"Where do you want them?\"\\n\\n \"I was thinking of Greenwich,\" Pierce said. \"It would be pleasant if they were in Greenwich.\"\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re needing a bone nose to pass them the slang.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Pierce said.\\n\\n Agar thought for a moment. \"There\u0027s a dolly-mop, Lucinda, in Seven Dials. They say she knows one or two miltonians--- dabs it up with them whenever they pinch her, which is often, seeing as how they like the dabbing.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Pierce said. \"They wouldn\u0027t believe a woman; it\u0027ll look like a feed to them.\"\\n\\n \"Well, there\u0027s Black Dick, the turfite. Know him? He\u0027s a Jew, to be found about the Queen\u0027s Crown of an evening.\"\\n\\n \"I know him,\" Pierce nodded. \"Black Dick\u0027s a lushington, too fond of his gin. I need a true bone nose, a man of the family.\"\\n\\n \"A man of the family? Then Chokee Bill will do you proper.\"\\n\\n \"Chokee Bill? That old mick?\"\\n\\n Agar nodded. \"Aye, he\u0027s a lag, did a stretch in Newgate. But not for long.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes?\" Pierce was suddenly interested. A shortened prison sentence often implied that the man had made a deal to turn nose, to become an informer. \"Got his ticket-of-leave early, did he?\"\\n\\n \"Uncommon early,\" Agar said. \"And the crushers gave him his broker\u0027s license quick-like, too. Very odd, seeing as he\u0027s a mick.\" Pawnbrokers were licensed by the police, who shared the usual prejudice against Irishmen.\\n\\n \"So he\u0027s in the uncle trade now?\" Pierce said.\\n\\n \"Aye,\" Agar said. \"But they say he deals barkers now and again. And they say he\u0027s a blower.\"\\n\\n Pierce considered this at length, and finally nodded. \"Where is Bill now?\"\\n\\n \"His uncling shop is in Battersea, on Ridgeby Way.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see him now,\" Pierce said, getting to his feet. \"I\u0027ll have a go at plucking the pigeon.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t make it too easy,\" Agar warned.\\n\\n Pierce smiled. \"It will take all their best efforts.\" He went to the door.\\n\\n \"Here, now,\" Agar called to him, with a sudden thought. \"It just came to me mind: what\u0027s there for a flash pull in Greenwich, of all places?\"\\n\\n \"That,\" Pierce said, \"is the very question the crushers will be asking themselves.\"\\n\\n \"But is there a pull?\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"A flash pull?\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"But what is it, then?\"\\n\\n Pierce shook his head. He grinned at Agar\u0027s perplexed look and left the room.\\n\\n When Pierce came out of the accommodation house, it was twilight. He immediately saw the two crushers lurking at opposite corners of the street. He made a show of looking nervously about, then walked to the end of the block, where he hailed a cab.\\n\\n He rode the cab several blocks, then jumped out quickly at a busy part of Regent Street, crossed the thoroughfare, and took a hansom going in the opposite direction. To all appearances, he was operating with the utmost cunning. In fact, Pierce would never bother with the crossover fakement to dodge a tail; it was a glocky ploy that rarely worked, and when he glanced out of the small back window of the hansom cab, he saw that he had not thrown off his pursuers.\\n\\n He rode to the Regency Arms pub house, a notorious place. He entered it, exited from a side door (which was in plain view of the street), and crossed over to New Oxford Street, where he caught another cab. In the process, he lost one of the crushers, but the other was still with him. Now he proceeded directly across the Thames, to Battersea, to see Chokee Bill.\\n\\n The image of Edward Pierce, a respectable and well-dressed gentleman, entering the dingy premises of a Battersea pawnbroker may seem incongruous from a modern perspective. At the time, it was not at all uncommon, for the pawnbroker served more than the lower classes, and whomever he served, his function was essentially the same: to act as a sort of impromptu bank, operating more cheaply than established banking concerns. A person could buy an expensive article, such as a coat, and hock it one week to pay the rent; reclaim it a few days later, for wearing on Sunday; hock it again on Monday, for a smaller loan; and so on until there was no further need for the broker\u0027s services.\\n\\n The pawnbroker thus filled an important niche in the the society, and the number of licensed pawnshops doubled during the mid-Victorian period. Middle-class people were drawn to the broker more for the anonymity of the loan than the cheapness of it; many a respectable household did not wish it known that some of their silver was uncled for cash. This was, after all, an era when many people equated economic prosperity and good fiscal management with moral behavior; and conversely, to be in need of a loan implied some kind of misdeed.\\n\\n The pawnshops themselves were not really very shady, although they had that reputation. Criminals seeking fences usually turned to unlicensed, second-hand goods \"translators,\" who were not regulated by the police and were less likely to be under surveillance. Thus, Pierce entered the door beneath the three balls with impunity.\\n\\n He found Chokee Bill, a red-faced Irishman whose complexion gave the appearance of perpetual near strangulation, sitting in a back corner. Chokee Bill jumped to his feet quickly, recognizing the dress and manner of a gentleman.\\n\\n \"Evening, sir,\" Bill said.\\n\\n \"Good evening,\" Pierce said.\\n\\n \"How may I be serving you, sir?\"\\n\\n Pierce looked around the shop. \"Are we alone?\"\\n\\n \"We are, sir, as my name is Bill, sir.\" But Chokee Bill got a guarded look in his eyes.\\n\\n \"I am looking to make a certain purchase,\" Pierce said. As he spoke, he adopted a broad Liverpool dockyard accent, though ordinarily he had no trace of it.\\n\\n \"A certain purchase ...\"\\n\\n \"Some items you may have at hand,\" Pierce said.\\n\\n \"You see my shop; sir,\" Chokee Bill said, with a wave of his arm. \"All is before you.\"\\n\\n \"This is all?\"\\n\\n \"Aye, sir, whatever you may see.\"\\n\\n Pierce shrugged. \"I must have been told wrongly. Good evening to you.\" And he headed for the door.\\n\\n He was almost there when Chokee Bill coughed. \"What is it you were told, sir?\"\\n\\n Pierce looked back at him. \"I need certain rare items.\"\\n\\n \"Rare items,\" Chokee Bill repeated. \"What manner, of rare items, sir?\"\\n\\n \"Objects of metal,\" Pierce said, looking directly at the pawnbroker. He found all this circumspection tedious, but it was necessary to convincthe genuineness of his transaction.\\n\\n \"Metal, you say?\"\\n\\n Pierce made a deprecating gesture with his hands. \"It is a question of defense, you see.\\n\\n \"Defense.\"\\n\\n \"I have valuables, property, articles of worth... And therefore I need defense. Do you take my meaning?\"\\n\\n \"I take your meaning,\" Bill said. \"And I may have v such a thing as you require.\"\\n\\n \"Actually,\" Pierce said, looking around the shop again, as if to reassure himself that he was truly alone with the proprietor, \"actually, I need five.\"\\n\\n \"Five barkers?\" Chokee Bill\u0027s eyes widened in astonishment.\\n\\n Now that his secret was out, Pierce became very nervous. \"That\u0027s right,\" he said, glancing this way and that, \"five is what I need.\"\\n\\n \"Five\u0027s a goodly number,\" Bill said, frowning.\\n\\n Pierce immediately edged toward the door. \"Well, if you can\u0027t snaffle them---\"\\n\\n \"Wait, now,\" Bill said, \"I\u0027m not saying can\u0027t. You never heard me say can\u0027t. All\u0027s I said is five is a goodly number, which it is, right enough.\"\\n\\n \"I was told you had them at hand,\" Pierce said, still nervous.\\n\\n \"I may.\"\\n\\n \"Well, then, I should like to purchase them at once.\"\\n\\n Chokee Bill sighed. \"They\u0027re not here, sir--- you can count on that--- a man doesn\u0027t keep barkers about in an uncle shop, no, sir.\"\\n\\n \"How quickly can you get them?\"\\n\\n As Pierce became more agitated, Chokee Bill became more calm, more appraising. Pierce could almost see his mind working, thinking over the meaning of a request for five pistols. It implied a major crime, and no mistake. As a blower, he might make a penny or two if he knew the details.\\n\\n \"It would be some days, sir, and that\u0027s the truth,\" Bill said.\\n\\n \"I cannot have them now?\"\\n\\n \"No, sir, you\u0027d have to give me a space of time, and then I\u0027ll have them for you, right enough.\"\\n\\n \"How much time?\"\\n\\n There followed a long silence. Bill went so far as to mumble to himself, and tick off the days on his fingers. \"A fortnight would be safe.\"\\n\\n \"A fortnight!\"\\n\\n \"Eight days, then.\"\\n\\n \"Impossible,\" Pierce said, talking aloud to himself. \"In eight days, I must be in Greenw---\" He broke off. \"No,\" he said. \"Eight days is too long.\"\\n\\n \"Seven?\" Bill asked.\\n\\n \"Seven,\" Pierce said, staring at the ceiling. \"Seven, seven... seven days... Seven days is Thursday next?\"\\n\\n \"Aye, Sir\"\\n\\n At what hour on Thursday next?\"\\n\\n \"A question of timing, is it?\" Bill asked, with a casualness that was wholly unconvincing.\\n\\n Pierce just stared at him.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t mean to pry, sir,\" Bill said quickly.\\n\\n \"Then see you do not. What hour on Thursday?\"\\n\\n \"Noon.\"\\n\\n Pierce shook his head. \"We will never come to terms. It is impossible and I---\"\\n\\n \"Here, now--- here, now. What hour Thursday must it be?\"\\n\\n \"No later than ten o\u0027clock in the morning.\"\\n\\n Chokee Bill reflected. \"Ten o\u0027clock here?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"And no later?\"\\n\\n \"Not a minute later.\"\\n\\n \"Will you be coming yourself, then, to collect them?\"\\n\\n Once again, Pierce gave him a stern look. \"That hardly need concern you. Can you supply the pieces or not?\"\\n\\n \"I can,\" Bill said. \"But there\u0027s an added expense for the quick service.\"\\n\\n \"That will not matter,\" Pierce said, and gave him ten gold guineas. \"You may have this on account\"\\n\\n Chokee Bill looked at the coins, turned them over in his palm. \"I reckon this is the half of it.\"\\n\\n \"So be it.\"\\n\\n \"And the rest will be paid in kind?\"\\n\\n \"In gold, yes.\"\\n\\n Bill nodded. \"Will you be needing shot as well?\"\\n\\n \"What pieces are they?\"\\n\\n \"Webley 48-bore, rim-fire, holster models, if my guess is right.\"\\n\\n \"Then I will need shot.\"\\n\\n \"Another three guineas for shot,\" Chokee Bill said blandly.\\n\\n \"Done,\" Pierce said. He went to the door, and paused. \"A final consideration,\" he said. \"If, when I arrive Thursday next, the pieces are not waiting, it shall go hard with you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m reliable, sir.\"\\n\\n \"It will go very hard,\" Pierce said again, \"if you are not. Think on it\" And he left.\\n\\n It was not quite dark; the street was dimly lit by gas lamps. He did not see the lurking crusher but knew he was there somewhere. He took a cab and drove to Leicester Square, where the crowds were gathering for the evening\u0027s theatrical productions. He entered one throng, bought a ticket for a showing of She Stoops to Conquer, and then lost himself in the lobby. He was home an hour later, after three cab changes and four duckings in and out of pubs. He was quite certain he had not been followed. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-great-train-robbery/page-26.html","bookId":2678,"book":{"id":2678,"title":"The Great Train Robbery","description":"Storyline: Lavish wealth and appalling poverty live side by side in Victorian London -- and Edward Pierce easily navigates both worlds.
