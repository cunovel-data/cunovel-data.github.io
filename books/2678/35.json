{"id":67968,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"Chapter 48 Kangaroo-Hunting \"A thorough comprehension of the devious criminal mind,\" wrote Edward Harranby in his memoirs, \"is vital to police interrogation.\" Harranby certainly had that comprehension, but he had to admit that the man seated before him, coughing and hacking, presented a particularly difficult case. They were in their second hour of questioning, but Robert Agar stuck to his story. In interrogations, Harranby favored the introduction of abrupt new lines of inquiry to keep the villains off balance. But Agar seemed to handle the technique easily. \"Mr. Agar,\" Harranby said. \"Who is John Simms? \"Never heard of \u0027im.\" \"Who is Edward Pierce?\" \"Never heard of \u0027im. I told you that.\" He coughed into a handkerchief offered him by Harranby\u0027s assistant, Sharp. \"Isn\u0027t this man Pierce a famous cracksman?\" \"I wouldn\u0027t know.\" \"You wouldn\u0027t know.\" Harranby sighed. He was certain Agar was lying. His posture, his flicking downcast eyes, his hand gestures--- everything suggested deceit. \"Well, now, Mr. Agar. How long have you been forging?\" \"I didn\u0027t do no soft,\" Agar said. \"I swear it wasn\u0027t me. I was in the pub downstairs, having a daffy or two is all. I swear.\" \"You are innocent?\" \"Aye, I am.\" Harranby paused. \"You\u0027re lying,\" he said. \"It\u0027s God\u0027s truth,\" Agar said. \"We\u0027ll see you in the stir for many years. Make no mistake about it.\" \"There\u0027s no blame upon me,\" Agar said, getting excited. \"Lies, all lies. You\u0027re a counterfeiter, pure and simple.\" \"I swear,\" Agar said. \"I\u0027d not do any soft. There\u0027s no sense to it---\" Abruptly, he broke off. There was a brief silence in the room, punctuated only by the ticking of a clock on the wall. Harranby had purchased the clock especially for its tick, which was steady, loud, and irritating to prisoners. \"Why is there no sense to it?\" he asked softly. \"I\u0027m honest is why,\" Agar said, staring at the floor. \"What honest work do you do?\" \"Local work. Here and there.\" That was a nonspecific excuse, but possible enough. In London at that time, there were nearly half a million unskilled laborers who worked at various odd jobs whenever the jobs were available. \"Where have you worked?\" \"Well, let\u0027s see, now,\" Agar said, squinting. \"I did a day for the gasworks at Millbank, loading. I did two days at Chenworth, hauling bricks. A week past I did some hours for Mr. Barnham, cleaning his cellar. I go where I can, you know.\" \"These employers would remember you?\" Agar smiled. \"Maybe.\" Here was another dead end for Harranby. Employers of casual labor often did not recall their workers, or recalled them incorrectly. Either way, it wouldn\u0027t mean much. Harranby found himself staring at the man\u0027s hands. Agar\u0027s hands were clenched in his lap. Then Harranby noticed that the little fingernail on one hand was long. It had been bitten at, to conceal this fact, but it was still somewhat long. A long fingernail might mean all sorts of things. Sailors wore a nail long for luck, particularly Greek sailors; then, too, certain clerks who used seals kept a nail long to pluck the seal from the hot wax. But for Agar... \"How long have you been a screwsrnan?\" Harranby said. \"Eh?\" Agar replied with an expression of elaborate innocence. \"Screwsman?\" \"Come, now,\" Harranby said. \"You know what a screwsman is.\" \"I worked as a sawyer once. Spent a year in the north, working in a mill as a sawyer, I did.\" Harranby was not distracted. \"Did you make the keys for the safes?\" \"Keys? What keys?\" Harranby sighed. \"You\u0027ve no future as an actor, Agar.\" \"I don\u0027t take your meaning, sir,\" Agar said. \"What keys are you talking of?\" \"The keys to the train robbery.\" Here Agar laughed. \"Cor,\" he said. \"You think if I was in on that flash pull I\u0027d be doing a bit of soft now? You think that? That\u0027s Blocky, that is.\" Harranby\u0027s face was expressionless, but he knew that Agar was right. It made no sense for a man who had participated in a twelve-thousand-pound theft to be stamping out five-pound notes a year later. \"There\u0027s no use in pretending,\" Harranby said. \"We know that Simms has abandoned you. He doesn\u0027t care what happens to you--- why are you protecting him?\" \"Never heard of \u0027im,\" Agar said. \"Lead us to him, and you\u0027ll have a fine reward for your troubles.\" \"Never heard of \u0027im,\" Agar said sgain. \"Can\u0027t you see that plain?\" Harranby paused and stared at Agar. The man was quite calm, except for his coughing attacks. He glanced at Sharp, in the corner. It was time for a different approach. Harranby picked up a piece of paper from his desk, and put on his spectacles. \"Now, then, Mr. Agar,\" he said. \"This is a report on your past record. It\u0027s none too good.\" \"Past record?\" Now his puzzlement was genuine. \"I\u0027ve no past record.\" \"Indeed you do,\" Harranby said, running his finger along the print on the paper. \"Robert Agar... hum... twenty-six years old... hmm... born Bethnal Green... hmm... Yes, here we are. Bridewell prison, six months, charge of vagrancy, in 1849---\" \"That\u0027s not true!\" Agar exploded. \"---and Coldbath, one year eight months, charge of robbery, in 1852---\" \"Not true, I swear it, not true!\" Harranby glared at the prisoner over his glasses. \"It\u0027s all here in the record, Mr. Agar. I think the judge will be interested to learn it. What do you suppose he will get, Mr. Sharp?\" \"Fourteen years transportation, at least,\" Sharp said, in a thoughtful way. \"Umm, yes, fourteen years in Australia--- that sounds about right.\" \"Australia,\" Agar said, in a hushed voice. \"Well, I should think,\" Harranby said calmly. \"Boating\u0027s the thing in a case like this.\" Agar was silent. Harranby knew that although \"transportation\" was popularly portrayed as a much-feared punishment, the criminals themselves viewed banishment to Australia with equanimity or even pleasant expectation. Many villains suspected that Australia was agreeable, and to \"do the kangaroo hunts\" was unquestionably preferable to a long stretch in an English prison. Indeed, at this time Sydney, in New South Wales, was a thriving, handsome seaport of thirty thousand. In addition, it was a place where \"personal history is at a discount, and good memories and inquisitive minds are particularly disliked....\" And if it had its brutal side--- butchers were fond of plucking poultry while it was still alive--- it was also pleasant, with gaslit streets, elegant mansions, bejeweled women, and social pretensions of its own. A man like Agar could view transportation as, at the very least, a mixed blessing. But Agar was greatly agitated. Plainly, he did not want to leave England. Seeing this, Harranby was encouraged. He stood. \"That will be all for now,\" he said. \"If in the next day or so you feel that you have something you wish to tell me, just inform the guards at Newgate.\" Agar was ushered out of the room. Harranby sat back at his desk. Sharp came over. \"What were you reading?\" he asked. Harranby picked up the sheet of paper from his desk. \"A notification from the Buildings Committee,\" he said, \"to the effect that carriages are no longer to be parked in the courtyard.\" After three days, Agar informed the Newgate guards that he would like another audience with Mr. Harranby. On November 13th, Agar told Harranby everything he knew about the robbery, in exchange for the promise of lenient treatment and the vague possibility that one of the institutions involved--- the bank or the railway or even the government itself--- might see fit to present him with a stipend from the still-outstanding offers of reward for information. Agar did not know where the money was kept. He said that Pierce had been paying him a monthly stipend in paper currency. The criminals had previously agreed that they would divide the profits two years after the crime, in May of the following year, 1857. Agar did, however, know the location of Pierces house. On the night of November 13th, the forces of the Yard surrounded the mansion of Edward Pierce, or John Simms, and entered it with barkers at the ready. But the owner was not at home; the frightened servants explained that he had left town to attend the P.R. spectacle the following day in Manchester.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-great-train-robbery/page-35.html","bookId":2678,"book":{"id":2678,"title":"The Great Train Robbery","description":"Storyline: Lavish wealth and appalling poverty live side by side in Victorian London -- and Edward Pierce easily navigates both worlds.
