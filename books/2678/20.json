{"id":67953,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Chapter 26 Crossing the Mary Blaine Scrob\n \"The distinction between base avarice and honest ambition may be exceeding fine,\" warned the Reverend Noel Blackwell in his 1853 treatise, On the Moral Improvement of the Human Race. No one knew the truth of his words better than Pierce, who arranged his next meeting at the Casino de Venise, on Windmill Street. This was a large and lively dance hall, brightly lit by myriad gas lamps. Young men spun and wheeled girls colorfully dressed and gay in their manner. Indeed, the total impression was one of fashionable splendor, which belied a reputation as a wicked and notorious place of assignation for whores and their clientele.\n Pierce went directly to the bar, where a burly man in a blue uniform with silver lapel markings sat hunched over a drink. The man appeared distinctly uncomfortable in the casino. \"Have you been here before?\" Pierce asked.\n The man turned. \"You Mr. Simms?\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n The burly man looked around the room, at the women, the finery, the bright lights. \"No,\" he said, \"never been before.\"\n \"Lively, don\u0027t you think?\"\n The man shrugged. \"Bit above me,\" he said finally, and turned back to stare at his glass.\n \"And expensive,\" Pierce said.\n The man raised his drink. \"Two shillings a daffy? Aye, it\u0027s expensive.\"\n \"Let me buy you another,\" Pierce said, raising a gray-gloved hand to beckon the bartender. \"Where do you live, Mr. Burgess?\"\n \"I got a room on Moresby Road,\" the burly man said.\n \"I hear the air is bad there:\"\n Burgess shrugged. \"It\u0027ll do.\"\n \"You married?\"\n \"Aye.\"\n The bartender came, and Pierce indicated two more drinks. \"What\u0027s your wife do?\"\n \"She sews.\" Burgess showed a flash of impatience. \"What\u0027s this all about, then?\"\n \"Just a little conversation,\" Pierce said, \"to see if you want to make more money.\"\n \"Only a fool doesn\u0027t,\" Burgess said shortly.\n \"You work the Mary Blaine,\" Pierce said.\n Burgess, with still more impatience, nodded and flicked the silver SER letters on his collar: the insignia of the South Eastern Railway.\n Pierce was not asking these questions to obtain information; he already knew a good deal about Richard Burgess, a Mary Blaine scrob, or guard on the railway. He knew where Burgess lived; he knew what his wife did; he knew that they had two children, aged two and four, and he knew that the four-year-old was sickly and needed the frequent attentions of a doctor, which Burgess and his wife could not afford. He knew that their room on Moresby Road was a sgualid, peeling, narrow chamber that was ventilated by the sulfurous fumes of an adjacent gasworks.\n He knew that Burgess fell into the lowest-paid category of railway employee. An engine driver was paid 35 shillings a week; a conductor 25 shillings; a coachman 20 or 21; but a guard was paid 15 shillings a week and counted himself lucky it was not a good deal less.\n Burgess\u0027s wife made ten shillings a week, which meant that the family lived on a total of about sixty-five pounds a year. Out of this came certain expenses--- Burgess had to provide his own uniforms--- so that the true income was probably closer to fifty-five pounds a year, and for a family of four it was a very rough go.\n Many Victorians had incomes at that level, but most contrived supplements of one sort or another: extra work, tips, and a child in industry were the most common. The Burgess household had none of these. They were compelled to live on their income, and it was little wonder that Burgess felt uncomfortable in a place that charged two shillings a drink. It was very far beyond his means.\n \"What\u0027s it to be?\" Burgess said, not looking at Pierce.\n \"I was wondering about your vision.\"\n \"My vision?\"\n \"Yes, your eyesight.\"\n \"My eyes are good enough.\"\n \"I wonder,\" Pierce said, \"what it would take for them to go bad.\"\n Burgess sighed, and did not speak for a moment. Finally he said in a weary voice, \"I done a stretch in Newgate a few years back. I\u0027m not wanting to see the cockchafer again.\"\n \"Perfectly sensible,\" Pierce said. \"And I don\u0027t want anybody to blow my lay. We both have our fears.\"\n Burgess gulped his drink. \"What\u0027s the sweetener?\"\n \"Two hundred quid,\" Pierce said.\n Burgess coughed, and pounded his chest with a thick fist. \"Two hundred quid,\" he repeated.\n \"That\u0027s right,\" Pierce said. \"Here\u0027s ten now, on faith.\" He removed his wallet and took out two fivepound notes; he held the wallet in such a way that Burgess could not fail to notice it was bulging. He set the money on the bar top.\n \"Pretty a sight as a hot nancy,\" Burgess said, but he did not touch it. \"What\u0027s the lay?\"\n \"You needn\u0027t worry over the lay. All you need to do is worry over your eyesight.\"\n \"What is it I\u0027m not to see, then?\"\n \"Nothing that will get you into trouble. You\u0027ll never see the inside of a lockup again, I promise you that.\"\n Burgess turned stubborn. \"Speak plain,\" he said.\n Pierce sighed. He reached for the money. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said,. \"I fear I must take my business elsewhere.\"\n Burgess caught his hand. \"Not overquick,\" he said. \"I\u0027m just asking.\"\n \"I can\u0027t tell you.\"\n \"You think I\u0027ll blow on you to the crushers?\"\n \"Such things,\" Pierce said, \"have been known to happen.\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t blow.\"\n Pierce shrugged.\n There was a moment of silence. Finally, Burgess reached over with his other hand and plucked away the two five-pound notes. \"Tell me what I do,\" he said.\n \"It\u0027s very simple,\" Pierce said. \"Soon you will be approached by a man who will ask you whether your wife sews your uniforms. When you meet that man, you simply... look away.\"\n \"That\u0027s all?\"\n \"That\u0027s all.\"\n \"For two hundred quid?\"\n \"For two hundred quid.\"\n Burgess frowned for a moment, and then began to laugh.\n \"What\u0027s funny?\" Pierce said.\n \"You\u0027ll never pull it,\" Burgess said. \"It\u0027s not to be done, that one. There\u0027s no cracking those safes, wherever I look. Few months past, there\u0027s a kid, works into the baggage car, wants to do those safes. Have a go, I says to him, and he has a go for half an hour, and he gets no further than the tip of my nose. Then I threw him off smartly, bounced him on his noggin.\"\n \"I know that,\" Pierce said. \"I was watching.\"\n Burgess stopped laughing.\n Pierce withdrew two gold guineas from his pocket and dropped them on the counter. \"There\u0027s a dolly-mop in the corner--- pretty thing, wearing pink. I believe she\u0027s waiting for you,\" Pierce said, and then he got up and walked off. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-great-train-robbery/page-20.html","bookId":2678,"book":{"id":2678,"title":"The Great Train Robbery","description":"Storyline: \n Lavish wealth and appalling poverty live side by side in Victorian London -- and Edward Pierce easily navigates both worlds.
