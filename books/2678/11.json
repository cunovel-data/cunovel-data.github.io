{"id":67945,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Chapter 12 The Problem of Miss Elizabeth Trent\n Victorian England was the first society to constantly gather statistics on itself, and generally these figures were a source of unabashed pride. Beginning in 1840, however, one trend worried the leading thinkers of the day: there were increasingly more single women than men. By 1851, the number of single women of marriageable age was reliably put at 2,765,000--- and a large proportion of these women were the daughters of the middle and upper classes.\n Here was a problem of considerable dimension and gravity. Women of lower stations in life could take jobs as seamstresses, flower girls, field workers, or any of a dozen lowly occupations. These women were of no pressing concern; they were slovenly creatures lacking in education and a discriminating view of the world. A. H. White reports, in tones of astonishment, that he interviewed a young girl who worked as a matchbox maker, who \"never went to church or chapel. Never heard of \u0027England\u0027 or \u0027London\u0027 or the \u0027sea\u0027 or \u0027ships.\u0027 Never heard of God. Does not know what He does. Does not know whether it is better to be good or bad.\"\n Obviously, in the face of such massive ignorance, one must simply be grateful that the poor child had discovered some way to survive in society at all. But the problem presented by the daughters of middle- and upper-class households was different. These young ladies possessed education and a taste for genteel living. And they had been raised from birth for no other purpose than to be \"perfect wives.\"\n It was terribly important that such women should marry. The failure to marry--- spinsterhood--- implied a kind of dreadful crippling, for it was universally acknowledged that \"a woman\u0027s true position was that of administratrix, mainspring, guiding star of the home,\" and if she was unable to perform this function, she became a sort of pitiful social misfit, an oddity.\n The problem was made more acute by the fact that well-born women had few alternatives to wifehood. After all, as one contemporary observer noted, what occupations could they find \"without losing their position in society? A lady, to be such, must be a mere lady, and nothing else. She must not work for profit, or engage in any occupation that money can command, lest she invade the rights of the working classes, who live by their labor....\"\n In practice, an unmarried upper-class woman could use the one unique attribute of her position, education, and become a governess. But by 1851, twenty-five thousand women were already employed as governesses and there was, to say the least, no need for more. Her other choices were much less appealing: she might be a shop assistant, a clerk, a telegraphist, or a nurse, but all these occupations were more suitable for an ambitious lower-class woman than a firmly established gentlewoman of quality.\n If a young woman refused such demeaning work, her spinsterhood implied a considerable financial burden upon the household. Miss Emily Downing observed that \"the daughters of professional men... cannot but feel themselves a burden and a drag on the hard-won earnings of their fathers; they must know--- if they allow themselves to think at all--- that they are a constant cause of anxiety, and that should they not get married, there is every probability of their being, sooner or later, obliged to enter the battle of life utterly unprepared and unfitted for the fight.\"\n In short, there was intense pressure for marriage--- any sort of decent marriage--- felt by fathers and daughters alike. The Victorians tended to marry relatively late, in their twenties or thirties, but Mr. Edgar Trent had a daughter Elizabeth, now twenty-nine and of \"wholly marriageable condition\"--- meaning somewhat past her prime. It could not have escaped Mr. Trent\u0027s attention that the red-bearded gentleman might be in need of a wife. The gentleman himself expressed no reluctance to marry, but rather had indicated that the exigencies of business had kept him from pursuing personal happiness. Thus there was no reason to believe that this well-dressed, evidently well-to-do young man with a sporting instinct might not be drawn to Elizabeth. With this in mind, Mr. Trent contrived to invite Mr. Pierce to his house on Highwater Road for Sunday tea, on the pretext of discussing the purchase of a fighting dog from Mr. Pierce. Mr. Pierce, somewhat reluctantly, accepted the invitation.\n Elizabeth Trent was not called as a witness at the trial of Pierce, out of deference to her finer sensibilities. But popular accounts of the time give us an accurate picture of her. She was of medium height, rather darker in complexion than was the fashion, and her features were, in the words of one observer, \"regular enough without being what one might call pretty.\" Then, as now, journalists were inclined to exaggerate the beauty of any woman involved in a scandalous event, so that the absence of compliments about Miss Trent\u0027s appearance probably implies \"an unfortunate aspect.\"\n She apparently had few suitors, save for those openly ambitious fellows eager to marry a bank president\u0027s daughter, and these she staunchly rejected, with her father\u0027s undoubtedly mixed blessing. But she must surely have been impressed with Pierce, that \"dashing, intrepid, fine figure of a man. with charm to burn.\"\n By all accounts, Pierce was equally impressed by the young lady. A servant\u0027s testimony records their initial meeting, which reads as if it came from the pages of a Victorian novel.\n Mr. Pierce was taking tea on the rear lawn with Mr. Trent and Mrs. Trent, an \"acknowledged beauty of the town.\" They watched as bricklayers in the back yard patiently erected a ruined building, while nearby a gardener planted picturesque weeds. This was the last gasp of a nearly one-hundred-year English fascination with ruins; they were still so fashionable that everyone who could afford a decent ruin installed one on his grounds.\n Pierce watched the workmen for a while. \"What is it to be?\" he inquired.\n \"We thought a water mill,\" Mrs. Trent said. \"It will be so delightful, especially if there is the rusted curve of the waterwheel itself. Don\u0027t you think so?\"\n \"We are building the rusted wheel at a goodly expense,\" Mr. Trent grumbled.\n \"It is being constructed of previously rusted metal, saving us a good deal of bother,\" Mrs. Trent added. \"But of course we must wait for the weeds to grow up around the site before it takes on the proper appearance.\"\n At that moment Elizabeth arrived, wearing white crinoline. \"Ah, my darling daughter,\" Mr. Trent said, rising, and Mr. Pierce rose with him. \"May I present Mr. Edward Pierce, my daughter Elizabeth.\"\n \"I confess I did not know you had a daughter,\" Pierce said. He bowed deeply at the waist, took her hand, and seemed about to kiss it but hesitated. He appeared greatly flustered by the young woman\u0027s arrival on the scene.\n \"Miss Trent,\" he said, releasing her hand awkwardly. \"You take me quite by surprise.\"\n \"I cannot tell if that is to my advantage or no,\" Elizabeth Trent replied, quickly taking a seat at the tea table and holding out her hand until a filled cup was put in it.\n \"I assure you, it is wholly to your advantage,\" Mr. Pierce replied. And he was reported to have colored deeply at this remark.\n Miss Trent fanned herself; Mr. Trent cleared his throat; Mrs. Trent, the perfect wife, picked up a tray of biscuits and said, \"Will you try one of these, Mr. Pierce?\"\n \"With gratitude, Madam,\" Mr. Pierce replied, and no one present doubted the sincerity of his words.\n \"We are just discussing the ruins,\" Mr. Trent said, in a somewhat overloud voice. \"But prior to that Mr. Pierce was telling us of his travels abroad. He has recently returned from New York, in point of fact.\"\n It was a cue; his daughter picked it up neatly. \"Really?\" she said, fanning herself briskly. \"How utterly fascinating.\"\n \"I fear it is more so in the prospect than the telling,\" Mr. Pierce replied, avoiding the glance of the young woman to such a degree that all observed his abashed reticence. He was clearly taken with her; and the final proof was that he addressed his remarks to Mrs. Trent. \"It is a city like any other in the world, if truth be told, and chiefly distinguished by the lack of niceties which we residents of London take for granted.\"\n \"I have been informed,\" Miss Trent ventured, still fanning, \"that there are native predators in the region.\"\n \"I should be delighted if I regale you,\" Mr. Pierce said, \"with endless adventures with the Indians--- for so they are called, in America as in the East--- but I fear I have no adventures to report. The wilderness of America does not begin until the Mississippi is crossed.\"\n \"Have you done so?\" asked Mrs. Trent.\n \"I have,\" Mr. Pierce replied. \"It is a vast river, many times more broad than the Thames, and it marks the boundary in America between civilization and savagery. Although lately they are constructing a railway across that vast colony\"--- he permitted himself the condescending reference to America, and Mr. Trent guffawed \"and I expect with the coming of the railway, the savagery will soon vanish.\"\n \"How quaint,\" Miss Trent said, apparently unable to think of anything else to say.\n \"What business took you to New York?\" Mr. Trent asked\n \"If I may be so bold,\" Mr. Pierce continued, ignoring the question, \"and if the delicate ears of the ladies present shall not be offended, I shall give an example of the savagery which persists in the American lands, and the rude way of life which many persons there think nothing remarkable. Do you know of buffaloes?\"\n \"I have read of them,\" said Mrs. Trent, her eyes flashing. According to some of the testimony of the servants, she was as taken with Mr. Pierce as was her stepdaughter, and her demeanor created a minor scandal within the Trent household. Mrs. Trent said, \"These buffaloes are large beasts, like wild cows, and shaggy.\"\n \"Precisely so,\" Mr. Pierce said. \"The western portion of the American country is widely populated with these buffalo creatures, and many persons make their livelihood--- such as it is--- in hunting them.\"\n \"Have you been to California, where there is gold?\" asked Miss Trent abruptly.\n \"Yes,\" Pierce said.\n \"Let the man finish his tale,\" Mrs. Trent said, rather too sharply.\n \"Well,\" Pierce said, \"the buffalo hunters, as they are known, sometimes seek the flesh of the animals, which is reckoned like venison, and sometimes the hide,, which also has value.\"\n \"They lack tusks,\" Mr. Trent said. Mr. Trent had lately financed an elephant-killing expedition on behalf of the bank, and at this very moment an enormous warehouse at dockside was filled with five thousand ivory tusks. Mr. Trent had gone to inspect these goods for himself, a vast room of white curving tusks, most impressive.\n \"No, they have no tusks, although the male of the species possesses horns.\"\n \"Horns, I see. But not of ivory.\"\n \"No, not ivory.\"\n \"I see.\"\n \"Please go on,\" Mrs. Trent said, her eyes still flashing.\n \"Well,\" Pierce said, \"the men who ki--- who dispatch these buffalos are called buffalo hunters, and they utilize rifles for their purposes. On occasion they organize themselves into a line to drive the beasts over some cliff in a mass. But that is not common. Most frequently, the beast is dispatched singly. In any event--- and here I must beg excuses for the crudity of what I must report of this crude countryside--- once the beast has terminated existence, its innards are removed.\"\n \"Very sensible,\" Mr. Trent said.\n \"To be sure,\" Pierce said, \"but here is the peculiar part. These buffalo hunters prize as the greatest of delicacies one portion of the innards, that being the small intestines of the beast.\"\n \"How are they prepared?\" Miss Trent asked. \"By roasting over a fire, I expect.\"\n \"No, Madam,\" Pierce said, \"for I am telling you a tale of abject savagery. These intestines which are so prized, so much considered a delicacy, are consumed upon the spot, in a state wholly uncooked.\"\n \"Do you mean raw?\" asked Mrs. Trent, wrinkling her nose.\n \"Indeed, Madam, as we would consume a raw oyster, so do the hunters consume the intestine, and that while it is still warm from the newly expired beast.\"\n \"Dear God,\" said Mrs. Trent.\n \"Now, then,\" Pierce continued, \"it happens upon occasion that two men may have joined in the killing, and immediately afterward each falls upon one end of the prized intestines. Each hunter races the other, trying to gobble up this delicacy faster than his opponent.\"\n \"Gracious,\" Miss Trent said, fanning herself more briskly.\n \"Not only that,\" Pierce said, \"but in their greedy haste, the buffalo hunter often swallows the portions whole. This is a known trick. But his opponent, recognizing the trick, may in the course of eating pull from the other the undigested portion straightaway from his mouth, as I might pull a string through my fingers. And thus one man may gobble up what another has earlier eaten, in a manner of speaking.\"\n \"Oh, dear,\" said Mrs. Trent, turning quite pale.\n Mr. Trent cleared his throat. \"Remarkable.\"\n \"How quaint,\" said Miss Trent bravely, with a quivering voice.\n \"You really must excuse me,\" said Mrs. Trent, rising.\n \"My dear,\" Mr. Trent said.\n \"Madam, I hope I have not distressed you,\" said Mr. Pierce, also rising.\n \"Your tales are quite remarkable,\" Mrs. Trent said, turning to leave.\n \"My dear,\" Mr. Trent said again, and hastened after her.\n Thus Mr. Edward Pierce and Miss Elizabeth Trent were briefly alone on the back lawn of the mansion; and they were seen to exchange a few words. The content of their conversation is not known. But Miss Trent later admitted to a servant that she found Mr. Pierce \"quite fascinating in a rough-and-ready way,\" and it was generally agreed in the Trent household that young Elizabeth was now in possession of that most valuable of all acquisitions, a \"prospect.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-great-train-robbery/page-11.html","bookId":2678,"book":{"id":2678,"title":"The Great Train Robbery","description":"Storyline: \n Lavish wealth and appalling poverty live side by side in Victorian London -- and Edward Pierce easily navigates both worlds.
