{"id":67949,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Chapter 17 The Necessity of a Fresh\\n\\n Mr. Henry Fowler, seated in a dark recess of the taproom at the lunch hour, showed every sign of agitation. He bit his lip, he twisted his glass in his hands, and he could hardly bring himself to look into the eyes of his friend Edward Pierce. \"I do not know how to begin,\" he said. \"It is a most embarrassing circumstance.\"\\n\\n \"You are assured of my fullest confidence,\" Pierce said, raising his glass.\\n\\n \"I thank you,\" Fowler said. \"You see,\" he began, then faltered. \"You see, it is\"--- he broke off, and shook his head--- \"most dreadfully embarrassing.\"\\n\\n \"Then speak of it forthrightly,\" Pierce advised, \"as one man to another.\"\\n\\n Fowler gulped his drink, and set the glass back on the table with a sharp clink. \"Very well. Plainly, the long and the short of it is that I have the French malady.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, dear,\" Pierce said.\\n\\n \"I fear I have overindulged,\" said Fowler sadly, \"and now I must pay the price. It is altogether most wretched and vexing.\" In those days, venereal disease was thought to be the consequence of sexual overactivity. There were few cures, and fewer doctors willing to treat a patient with the illness. Most hospitals made no provision for gonorrhea and syphilis at all. A respectable man who contracted these diseases became an easy target for blackmail; thus Mr. Fowler\u0027s reticence.\\n\\n \"How may I help you?\" Pierce asked, already knowing the answer.\\n\\n \"I maintained the hope--- not falsely, I pray--- that as a bachelor, you might have knowledge--- ah, that you might make an introduction on my behalf to a fresh girl, a country girl.\"\\n\\n Pierce frowned. \"It is no longer so easy as it once was.\"\\n\\n \"I know that, I know that,\" Fowler said, his voice rising heatedly. He checked himself, and spoke more quietly. \"I understand the difficulty. But I was hoping...\"\\n\\n Pierce nodded. \"There is a woman in the Haymarket,\" he said, \"who often has a fresh or two. I can make discreet inquiries.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, please,\" said Mr. Fowler, his voice tremulous. And he added, \"It is most painful.\"\\n\\n \"All I can do is inquire,\" Pierce said.\\n\\n \"I should be forever in your debt,\" Mr. Fowler said. \"It is most painful.\"\\n\\n \"I shall inquire,\" Pierce said. \"You may expect a communication from me in a day or so. In the meanwhile, do not lose cheer.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, thank you, thank you,\" Fowler said, and called for another drink.\\n\\n \"It may be expensive,\" Pierce warned.\\n\\n \"Damn the expense, man. I swear I will pay anything!\" Then he seemed to reconsider this comment. \"How much do you suppose?\"\\n\\n \"A hundred guineas, if one is to be assured of a true fresh.\"\\n\\n \"A hundred guineas?\" He looked unhappy.\\n\\n \"Indeed, and only if I am fortunate enough to strike a favorable bargain. They are much in demand, you know.\"\\n\\n \"Well, then, it shall be,\" Mr. Fowler said, gulping another drink. \"Whatever it is, it shall be.\"\\n\\n Two days later, Mr. Fowler received by the newly instituted penny post a letter addressed to him at his offices at the Huddleston \u0026 Bradford Bank. Mr. Fowler was much reassured by the excellent quality of the stationery, and the fine penmanship displayed by the mistakably feminine hand.\\n\\n Nov. 11, 1854\\n\\n Sir,\\n\\n Our mutual acquaintance, Mr. P., has requested that I inform you when next I knew of any lady--- fresh. I am pleased to recommend to you a very pretty fair young girl, just come from the country, and I think you will like her very much. If it is convenient for you, you may meet her in four days\u0027 time at Lichfield Street, at the bottom of St. Martin\u0027s Lane, at eight o\u0027clock. She shall be there waiting for you, and suitable arrangements for private quarterings have been made nearby.\\n\\n I remain, Sir, your most obedient humble servant,\\n\\n M.B.\\n\\n South Moulton Street\\n\\n There was no mention of the price of the girl, but Mr. Fowler hardly cared. His private parts were now swollen and extremely tender, so much so, in fact, that he could think of nothing else as he sat at his desk and tried to conduct the business of the day. He looked again at the letter and again felt reassured by the excellent impression it made. In every aspect, it smacked of the utmost reliability, and that was important. Fowler knew that many virgins were nothing of the sort, but rather young girls initiated a score of times over, with their \"demure state\" freshly renewed by the application of a small seamstress\u0027s stitch in a strategic place.\\n\\n He also knew that intercourse with a virgin was not uniformly accepted as a cure for venereal disease. Many men swore the experience produced a cure; others rejected the idea. It was often argued that the failures resulted from the fact that the girl was not genuinely fresh. Thus Mr. Fowler looked at the stationery and the penmanship, and found there the reassurance he hoped to find. He sent off a quick note of vague thanks to his friend Pierce for his assistance in this matter.\\n\\n Chapter 18 The Carriage Fakement\\n\\n On the same day that Mr. Fowler was writing a letter of thanks to Mr. Pierce, Mr. Pierce was preparing to crack the mansion of Mr. Trent. Involved in this plan were five people: Pierce, who had some inside knowledge of the layout of the house; Agar, who would make the wax impression of the key; Agar\u0027s woman, who would act as \"crow,\" or lookout; and Barlow who would be a \"stall,\" providing diversion.\\n\\n There was also the mysterious Miss Miriam. She was essential to the planned housebreak, for she would carry out what was called \"the carriage fakement\" This was one of the most clever methods of breaking into a house. For its effect, the carriage fakement relied upon a solid social custom of the day--- the tipping of servants.\\n\\n In Victorian England, roughly 10 percent of the entire population was \"in service,\" and nearly all were poorly paid. The poorest paid were those whose tasks brought them in contact with visitors and house guests: the butler and the hall porter relied on tips for most of their annual income. Thus the notorious disdain of the porter for insubstantial callers--- and thus, too, the \"carriage fakement \"\\n\\n By nine o\u0027clock on the evening of November 12, 1854, Pierce had his confederates in their places. The crow, Agar\u0027s woman, lounged across the street from the Trent mansion. Barlow, the stall, had slipped down the alley toward the tradesman\u0027s entrance and the dog pens at the back of the house. Pierce and Agar were concealed in shrubbery right next to the front door. When all was in readiness, an elegant closed carriage drew up to the curb in front of the house, and the bell was rung.\\n\\n The Trent household\u0027s hall porter heard the ring, and opened the door. He saw the carriage drawn up at the curb. Dignified and conscious of tips, the porter was certainly not going to stand in the doorway and shout into the night to inquire what was wanted. When, after a moment, no one emerged from the carriage, he went down the steps to the curb to see if he could be of service.\\n\\n Inside the carriage he saw a handsome, refined woman who asked if this was the residence of Mr. Robert Jenkins. The porter said it was not, but he knew of Mr. Jenkins; the house was around the corner, and he gave directions.\\n\\n While this was happening, Pierce and Agar slipped into the house through the open front door. They proceeded directly to the cellar door. This door was locked, but Agar employed a twirl, or picklock, and had it open in a moment. The two men were inside the cellar, with the door closed behind them, by the time the porter received his shilling from the lady in the carriage. The porter tossed the coin in the air, caught it, walked back to the house, and locked up the door once more, never suspecting he had been tricked.\\n\\n That was the carriage fakement.\\n\\n In the light of a narrow-beam lantern, Pierce checked his watch. It was 9:04. That gave them an hour to find the key before Barlow provided his diversion to cover their escape.\\n\\n Pierce and Agar moved stealthily down the creaking stairs into the depths of the cellar. They saw the wine racks, locked behind iron gratings. These new locks yielded easily to Agar\u0027s attentions. At 9:11, they swung the grating door open and entered the wine cellar proper. They immediately began the search for the key.\\n\\n There was no way to be clever about the search. It was a slow and painstaking business. Pierce could make only one assumption about the hiding place: since Mr. Trent\u0027s wife was the person who usually went into the cellar, and since Mr. Trent did not want her coming across the key by accident, the banker probably hid his key at some inconveniently high location. They first searched the tops of the racks, feeling with their fingers. It was dusty, and there was soon a good deal of dust in the air.\\n\\n Agar, with his bad lungs, had difficulty suppressing his cough. Several times his stifled grunts were sufficiently loud to alarm Pierce, but the Trent household never heard them.\\n\\n Soon it was 9:30. Now, Pierce knew, time was beginning to work against them. Pierce searched more frantically and became impatient, hissing his complaints to Agar, who wielded the spot of light from the hot shaded lantern.\\n\\n Ten more minutes passed, and Pierce began to sweat. And then, with startling suddenness, his fingers felt something cold on the top of the wine-rack crossbars. The object fell to the ground with a metallic clink. A few moments of scrambling around on the earthern floor of the cellar, and they had the key. It was 9:45.\\n\\n Pierce held it into the spot from the lantern. In darkness, Agar groaned.\\n\\n \"What is it?\" Pierce whispered.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not it.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"I mean it\u0027s not the ruddy key, it\u0027s the wrong one.\"\\n\\n Pierce turned the key over in his hands. \"Are you sure?\" he whispered, but even as he spoke he knew Agar was right. The key was dusty and old; there was grime in the crevices of the prongs. Agar spoke his thoughts.\\n\\n \"Nobody\u0027s touched her in ten years.\"\\n\\n Pierce swore, and continued his search, while Agar held the lantern. Agar looked at the key critically.\\n\\n \"Damn me but she\u0027s odd,\" he whispered. \"I never seen the likes of it. Small as she is, delicate-like, could be a lady\u0027s twirl to some female trifle, you ask me---\"\\n\\n \"---Shut up,\" Pierce hissed.\\n\\n Agar fell silent. Pierce searched, feeling his heart thump in his chest, not looking at his clock, not wanting to know the time. Then his fingers again felt cold metal. He brought it into the light.\\n\\n It was a shiny key.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s for a safe,\" Agar said when he saw it.\\n\\n \"Right,\" Pierce said, sighing. He took the lantern and held it for Agar. Agar fished two wax blanks from his pockets. He held them in his hands to warm them a moment, and then he pressed the key into them, first one side, then the other.\\n\\n \"Time?\" he whispered.\\n\\n \"Nine-fifty-one,\" Pierce said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do another,\" Agar said, and repeated the process with a second set of blanks. This was common practice among the most adept screwsmen, for one never knew when a blank might be later injured after a break-in. When he had two sets, Pierce returned the key to its hiding place.\\n\\n \"Nine-fifty-seven.\"\\n\\n \"Crikey, it\u0027s close.\"\\n\\n They left the wine cellar, locking it behind them, and slipped up the stairs to the basement door. Then they waited.\\n\\n Barlow, lurking in the shadows near the servants\u0027 quarters, checked his own pocket watch and saw it was ten o\u0027clock. He had a moment of hesitation. On the one hand, every minute his accomplices spent inside the Trent household was dangerous; on the other hand, they might not have finished their work, despite the planned schedule. He had no wish to be the villain, greeted by the spectacle of their angry faces when they made their escape.\\n\\n Finally he muttered to himself, \"Ten is ten,\" and, carrying a bag, he moved back to the dog kennels. Three dogs were there, including the new gift of a made dog from Mr. Pierce. Barlow bent over the run and pushed four squeaking rats out of the bag and into the enclosure. Immediately, the dogs began to yelp and bark, raising a terrible din.\\n\\n Barlow slipped off into the shadows as he saw the lights come on in one window after another in the servants\u0027 quarters.\\n\\n Pierce and Agar, hearing the commotion, opened the cellar door and moved into the hallway, locking that door behind them. There was the sound of running footsteps at the back of the house. They unfastened the locks and bolts of the front door, let themselves out, and disappeared into the night.\\n\\n They left behind their only one sign of their visit: the unlocked front door. They knew that in the morning the hall porter, being first to arise, would come upon the front door and find the locks open. But the porter would remember the incident of the carriage the night before, and would assume that he had forgotten to lock up afterward. He might secretly suspect a housebreak, but as the day went on and nothing was discovered missing, he would forget all about it.\\n\\n In any case, no burglary of the Trent residence was, ever reported to authorities. The mysterious commotion of the dogs was explained by the bodies of the dead rats in the kennel. There was some discussion of how the rats had found their way into the dog run, but the Trent household was large and busy, and there was no time for idle speculation on trivial matters.\\n\\n Thus, by dawn of November 13, 1854, Edward Pierce had the first of the four keys he needed. He immediately directed his attention to obtaining the second key. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-great-train-robbery/page-15.html","bookId":2678,"book":{"id":2678,"title":"The Great Train Robbery","description":"Storyline: Lavish wealth and appalling poverty live side by side in Victorian London -- and Edward Pierce easily navigates both worlds.
