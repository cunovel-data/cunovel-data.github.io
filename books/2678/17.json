{"id":67951,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Chapter 21 An Audacious Act \"Of recent weeks,\" wrote the Illustrated London News on December 21, 1854, \"the incidence of bold and brutal street banditry has reached alarming proportions, particularly of an evening. It would appear that the faith Mr. Wilson placed in street gas lighting as a deterrent to blackguard acts has been unjustified, for the villains are ever bolder, preying upon an unsuspecting populace with the utmost audacity. Only yesterday a constable, Peter Farrell, was lured into an alley, whereupon a band of common thugs fell upon him, beating him and taking all of his possessions and even his very uniform. Nor must we forget that just a fortnight past, Mr. Parkington, M.P., was viciously assaulted in an open, well-lighted place while walking from Parliament to his club. This epidemic of garrotting must receive the prompt attention of authorities in the near future.\" The article went on to describe the condition of Constable Farrell, who was \"faring no better than could be expected.\" The policeman gave the story that he had been called by a well-dressed woman who was arguing with her cabdriver, \"a surly thug of a fellow with a white scar across the forehead.\" When the policeman interceded in the dispute, the cabby fell on him, swearing and cursing and beating him with a neddy, or blackjack; and when the unfortunate policeman came to his senses, he discovered he had been stripped of his clothing. In 1854, many urban-dwelling Victorians were concerned over what was viewed as an upsurge in street crime. Later periodic \"epidemics\" of street violence finally culminated in a pedestrian panic during the years 1862 and 1863, and the passage of the \"Garrotting Act\" by Parliament. This legislation provided unusually stiff penalties for offenders, including flogging in installments--- to allow the prisoners to recover before their next scheduled beating--- and hanging. Indeed, more people were hanged in England in 1863 than in any year since 1838. Brutal street crime was the lowest form of underworld activity. Rampsmen and footpads were frequently despised by their fellow criminals, who abhorred crude lays and acts of violence. The usual method of footpadding called for a victim, preferably drunk, to be lured into a corner by an accomplice, preferably a woman, whereupon the footpad would \"bear up\" on the victim, beat him with a cudgel and rob him, leaving him, in the gutter. It was not an elegant way to make a living. The lurid details of a footpadder bearing up on his hapless quarry were the ordinary fare of news reporting. Apparently, no one ever stopped to think how strange the attack on Constable Farrell really was. In fact, it made very little sense. Then, as now, criminals tried wherever possible to avoid confrontations with the police. To \"prop a crusher\" was merely asking for an all-out manhunt through the rookeries until the culprits were apprehended, for the police took a special interest in attacks on their own kind. Nor was there any sensible reason to attack a policeman. He was more capable than most victims of defending himself, and he never carried much money; often he had no money at all. And, finally, there was absolutely no point in stripping a policeman. In those days, stripping was a common crime, usually the work of old women who lured children into alleys and then took all their clothing to sell at a secondhand shop. But you could not take the down off a crusher\u0027s dunnage; that is, you could not disguise a policeman\u0027s uniform so that it would have resale value. Secondhand shops were always under surveillance, and always accused of taking stolen goods; no \"translator\" would ever accept a police uniform. It was perhaps the only kind of clothing in all London that had no resale value at all. Thus the attack on Constable Farrell was not merely dangerous but pointless, and any thoughtful observer would have been led to ponder why it had occurred at all. Chapter 22 The Prad Prig Sometime in late December, 1854, Pierce met a man named Andrew Taggert in the King\u0027s Arms publican house, off Regent Street. Taggert was by then nearly sixty, and a well-known character in the neighborhood. He had survived a long and varied career, which is worth briefly recounting, for he is one of the few participants in The Great Train Robbery whose background is known. Taggert was born around 1790 outside Liverpool, and came to London near the turn of the century with his unmarried mother, a prostitute. By the age of ten, he was employed in \"the resurrection trade,\" the business of digging up fresh corpses from graveyards to sell to medical schools. He soon acquired a reputation for uncommon daring; it was said that he once transported a stiff through London streets in daylight, with the man propped up in his cart like a passenger. The Anatomy Act of 1838 ended the business in corpses, and Andrew Taggert shifted to the smasher\u0027s job of \"ringing the changes\"--- disposing of counterfeit money. In this maneuver, a genuine coin would be offered to a shopkeeper for some purchase, and then the smasher would fumble in his purse, saying that he thought he had correct change, and take the original coin back. After a while, he would say, \"No, I don\u0027t have it, after all,\" and hand over a counterfeit coin in place of the original. This was petty work, and Taggert soon tired of it. He moved on to a variety of con games, becoming a full-fledged magsman by the middle 1840s. He was apparently very successful in his work; he took a respectable flat in Camden Town, which was not a wholly respectable area. (Charles Dickens had lived there some fifteen years earlier, while his father was in prison.) Taggert also took a wife, one Mary Maxwell, a widow, and it is one of those minor ironies that the master magsman should himself be conned. Mary Maxwell was a coiner specializing in small silver coins. This bit-faker had served time in prison on several occasions, and knew something of the law, which her new husband apparently did not, for she had not married idly. A woman\u0027s legal position was already the subject of active attempts at reform; but at this time women did not have the right to vote, to own property, or to make wills, and the earnings of any married woman who was separated from her husband were still legally the property of her husband. Although the law treated women as near idiots and appeared overwhelmingly to favor men, there were some odd quirks, as Taggert discovered soon enough. In 1847, the police raided Mary Maxwell Taggert\u0027s coining operation, catching her red-handed in the midst of stamping out sixpence pieces. She greeted the raid with equanimity, announced pleasantly that she was married and told the police the whereabouts of her husband. By law, a husband was responsible for any criminal activities of his wife. It was assumed that such activity must be the result of the husband\u0027s planning and execution, in which the wife was a mere--- and perhaps unwilling--- participant. In July, 1847, Andrew Taggert was arrested and convicted of counterfeiting currency and sentenced to eight years in Bridewell Prison; Mary Maxwell was released without so much as a reprimand. She is said to have displayed \"a roistering, bantering demeanour\" in the courtroom at the time of her husband\u0027s sentencing. Taggert served three years, and was given a ticket-of-leave and allowed to depart. Afterward it was said the steel had gone out of him, a common consequence of a prison term; he no longer had the energy or the confidence to be a magsman, and turned to hoof-snafffing, or horse stealing. By 1854, he was a familiar face in the flash sporting pubs frequented by turfites; he was said to have been involved in the scandal of 1853 in which a four-year-old was passed off as a three-year-old in the Derby. No one was certain but, as a known prad prig, he was thought to have engineered the theft of the most famous prad of recent years: Silver Whistle, a three-year-old from Derbyshire. Pierce met him in the King\u0027s Arms with a most peculiar suggestion, and Taggert gulped his gin as he said, \"You want to snaffle a what?\" \"A leopard,\" Pierce said. \"Now, where\u0027s an honest man like me to find a leopard?\" Taggert said. \"I wouldn\u0027t know,\" Pierce said. \"Never in my life,\" Taggert said, \"would I know of any leopard, excepting the bestiaries here and there, which have all manner of beasts.\" \"That\u0027s so,\" Pierce said calmly. \"Is it to be christened?\" Now this was a particularly difficult problem. Taggert was an expert christener--- a man who could conceal the fact that goods were stolen. He could disguise the markings of a horse so that even its owner would not recognize it. But christening a leopard might be harder. \"No,\" Pierce said. \"I can take it as you have it.\" \"Won\u0027t gull nobody.\" \"It doesn\u0027t have to.\" \"What\u0027s it for, then?\" Pierce gave Taggert a particularly severe look and did not reply. \"No harm in asking,\" Taggert said. \"It\u0027s not every day a man gets asked to snaffle a leopard, so I ask why--- no harm intended.\" \"It is a present,\" Pierce said, \"for a lady.\" \"Ah, a lady.\" \"On the Continent\" \"Ah, on the Continent\" \"In Paris.\" \"Ah.\" Taggert looked him up and down. Pierce was well dressed. \"You could buy one right enough,\" he said. \"Cost you just as dear as buying from me.\" \"I made you a business proposition.\" \"So you did, and a proper one, too, but you didn\u0027t mention the joeys for me. You just mention you want a knapped leopard.\" \"I\u0027ll pay you twenty guineas.\" \"Cor, you\u0027ll pay me forty and count yourself lucky.\" \"I\u0027ll pay you twenty-five and you\u0027ll count yourself lucky,\" Pierce said. Taggert looked unhappy. He twisted his gin glass in his hands. \"All right, then,\" he said. \"When\u0027s it to be?\" \"Never you mind,\" Pierce said. \"You find the animal and set the lay, and you\u0027ll hear from me soon enough.\" And he dropped a gold guinea on the counter. Taggert picked it up, bit it, nodded, and touched his cap. \"Good day to you, sir,\" he said. \"Good day,\" Pierce said Chapter 23 The Jolly Gaff The twentieth-century urban dweller\u0027s attitude of fear or indifference to a crime in progress would have astounded the Victorians. In those days, any person being robbed or mugged immediately raised a hue and cry, and the victim both expected and got an immediate response from law-abiding citizens around him, who joined in the fray with alacrity in an attempt to catch the bolting villain. Even ladies of breeding were known, upon occasion, to participate in a fracas with enthusiasm. There were several reasons for the willingness of the populace to get involved in a crime. In the first place, an organized police force was still relatively new; London\u0027s Metropolitan Police was the best in England, but it was only twenty-five years old, and people did not yet believe that crime was \"something for the police to take care of.\" Second, firearms were rare, and remain so to the present day in England; there was little likelihood of a bystander stopping a charge by pursuing a thief. And finally, the majority of criminals were children, often extremely young children, and adults were not hesitant to go after them. In any case, an adept thief took great care to conduct his business undetected, for if any alarm was raised, the chances were that he would be caught. For this very reason thieves often worked in gangs, with several members acting as \"stalls\" to create confusion in any alarm. Criminals of the day also utilized the fracas--- as a staged event--- to cover illegal activities, and this maneuver was known as a \"jolly gaff.\" A good jolly gaff required careful planning and timing, for it was, as the name implied, a form of theatre. On the morning of January 9, 1855, Pierce looked around the cavernous, echoing interior of the London Bridge Station and saw that all his players were in position. Pierce himself would perform the most crucial role, that of the \"beefer.\" He was dressed as a traveler, as was Miss Miriam alongside him. She would be the \"plant.\" A few yards distant was the \"culprit,\" a chavy nine years old, scruffy and noticeably (should anyone care to observe it, too noticeably) out of place among the crowd of first-class passengers. Pierce had himself selected the chavy from among a dozen children in the Holy Land; the criterion was speed, pure and simple. Farther away still was the \"crusher,\" Barlow, wearing a constable\u0027s uniform with the hat pulled down to conceal the white scar across his forehead. Barlow would permit the child to elude him as the gaff progressed. Finally, not far from the steps to the railway dispatcher\u0027s office was the whole point of the ploy: Agar, dressed out of twig--- disguised--- in his finest gentleman\u0027s clothing. As it came time for the London \u0026 Greenwich eleven-o\u0027clock train to depart, Pierce scratched his neck with his left hand. Immediately, the child came up and brushed rather abruptly against Miss Miriam\u0027s right side, rustling her purple velvet dress. Miss Miriam cried, \"I\u0027ve been robbed, John!\" Pierce raised his beef: \"Stop, thief!\" he shouted, and raced after the bolting chavy. \"Stop, thief!\" Startled bystanders immediately grabbed at the youngster, but he was quick and slippery, and soon tore free of the crowd and ran toward the back of the station. There Barlow in his policeman\u0027s uniform came forward menacingly. Agar, as a civic-spirited gentleman, also joined in the pursuit. The child was trapped; his only escape lay in a desperate scramble up the stairs leading to the railway office, and he ran hard, with Barlow, Agar, and Pierce fast on his heels. The little boy\u0027s instructions had been explicit: he was to get up the stairs, into the offce, past the desks of the clerks, and back to a high rear window opening out onto the roof of the station. He was to break this window in an apparent attempt to escape. Then ,Barlow would apprehend him. But he was to struggle valiantly until Barlow cuffed him; this was his signal that the gaff had ended. The child burst into the South Eastern Railway office, startling the clerks. Pierce dashed in immediately afterward: \"Stop him, he\u0027s a thief!\" Pierce shouted and, in his own pursuit, knocked over one of the clerks. The child was scrambling for the window. Then Barlow, the constable, came in. \"I\u0027ll handle this,\" Barlow said, in an authoritative and tough voice, but he clumsily knocked one of the desks over and sent papers flying. \"Catch him! Catch him!\" Agar called, entering the offices. By now the child was scrambling up onto the station dispatcher\u0027s desk, going toward a narrow high window; he cracked the glass with his small fist, cutting himself. The station dispatcher kept saying \"Oh, dear, oh, dear,\" over and over. \"I am an officer of the law, make way!\" Barlow shouted \"Stop him!\" Pierce screamed, allowing himself to become quite hysterical. \"Stop him, he\u0027s getting away!\" Glass fragments from the window fell on the floor, and Barlow and the child rolled on the ground in an uneven struggle that took rather longer to resolve itself than one might expect. The clerks and the dispatchers watched in considerable confusion. No one noticed that Agar had turned his back on the commotion and picked the lock on the door to the office, trying several of his jangling ring of bettys until he found one that worked the mechanism. Nor did anyone notice when Agar then moved to the side wall cabinet, also fitted with a lock, which he also picked with one key after another until he found one that worked. Three or four minutes passed before the young ruffian--- who kept slipping from the hands of the redfaced constable--- was finally caught by Pierce, who held him firmly. At last the constable gave the little villain a good boxing on the ears, and the lad ceased to struggle and handed up the purse he had stolen. He was carted away by the constable. Pierce dusted himself off, looked around the wreckage of the office, and apologized to the clerks and the dispatcher. Then the other gentleman who had joined in the pursuit said, \"I fear, sir, that you have missed your train.\" \"By God, I have,\" Pierce said. \"Damn the little rascal.\" And the two gentlemen departed--- the one thanking the other for helping corner the thief, and the other saying it was nothing--- leaving the clerks to clean up the mess. It was, Pierce later reflected, a nearly perfect jolly gaff.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-great-train-robbery/page-17.html","bookId":2678,"book":{"id":2678,"title":"The Great Train Robbery","description":"Storyline: Lavish wealth and appalling poverty live side by side in Victorian London -- and Edward Pierce easily navigates both worlds.
