{"id":76668,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Chapter 24 Hykey Doings When Clean Willy Williams, the snakesman, arrived at Pierces house late in the afternoon of January 9, 1855, he found himself confronted by a very strange spectacle in the drawing room. Pierce, wearing a red velvet smoking jacket, lounged in an easy chair, smoking a cigar, utterly relaxed, a stopwatch in his hands. In contrast, Agar, in shirtsleeves, stood in the center of the room. Agar was bent into a kind of half-crouch; he was watching Pierce and panting slightly. \"Are you ready?\" Pierce said. Agar nodded. \"Go!\" Pierce said, and flicked the stopwatch. To Clean Willy\u0027s amazement, Agar dashed across the room to the fireplace, where he began to jog in place, counting to himself, his lips moving, in a low whisper, \"...seven ...eight ...nine ....\" \"That\u0027s it,\" Pierce said. \"Door!\" \"Door!\" Agar said and, in pantomime, turned the handle on an unseen door. He then took three steps to the right, and reached up to shoulder height, touching something in the air. \"Cabinet,\" Pierce said. \"Cabinet...\" Now Agar fished two wax flats out of his pocket, and pretended to make an impression of a key. \"Time?\" he asked. \"Thirty-one,\" Pierce said. Agar proceeded to make a second impression, on a second set of flats, all the while counting to himself. \"Thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five....\" Again, he reached into the air, with both hands, as if closing something. \"Cabinet shut,\" he said, and took three paces back across the room. \"Door!\" \"Fifty-four,\" Pierce said. \"Steps!\" Agar said, and ran in place once more, and then sprinted across the room to halt beside Pierces chair. \"Done!\" he cried. Pierce looked at the watch and shook his head. \"Sixty-nine.\" He puffed on his cigar. \"Well,\" Agar said, in a wounded tone, \"it\u0027s better than it was. What was the last time?\" \"Your last time was seventy-three.\" \"Well, it\u0027s better---\" \"---But not good enough. Maybe if you don\u0027t close the cabinet. And don\u0027t hang up the keys, either. Willy can do that.\" \"Do what?\" Willy said, watching. \"Open and close the cabinet,\" Pierce said. Agar went back to his starting position. \"Ready?\" Pierce said. \"Ready,\" Agar said. Once again, this odd charade was repeated, with Agar sprinting across the room, jogging in place, pretending to open a door, taking three steps, making two wax impressions, taking three steps, closing a door, jogging in place, and then running across the room. \"Time?\" Pierce smiled. \"Sixty-three,\" he said Agar grinned, gasping for breath. \"Once more,\" Pierce said, \"just to be certain.\" Later in the afternoon, Clean Willy was given the lay. \"It\u0027ll be tonight,\" Pierce said. \"Once it\u0027s dark, you\u0027ll go up to London Bridge, and get onto the roof of the station. That a problem?\" Clean Willy shook his head. \"What then?\" \"When you\u0027re on the roof, cross to a window that is broken. You\u0027ll see it; it\u0027s the window to the dispatcher\u0027s office. Little window, barely a foot square.\" \"What then?\" \"Get into the office.\" \"Through the window?\" \"Yes.\" \"What then?\" \"Then you will see a cabinet, painted green, mounted on the wall.\" Pierce looked at the little snakesman. \"You\u0027ll have to stand on a chair to reach it. Be very quiet; there\u0027s a jack posted outside the office, on the steps.\" Clean Willy frowned. \"Unlock the cabinet,\" Pierce said, \"with this key.\" He nodded to Agar, who gave Willy the first of the picklocks. \"Unlock the cabinet, and open it up, and wait.\" \"What for?\" \"Around ten-thirty, there\u0027ll be a bit of a shindy. A soak will be coming into the station to chat up the jack.\" \"What then?\" \"Then you unlock the main door to the office, using this key here\"--- Agar gave him the second key--- \"and then you wait.\" \"What for?\" \"For eleven-thirty, or thereabouts, when the jack goes to the W.C. Then, Agar comes up the steps, through the door you\u0027ve unlocked, and he makes his waxes. He leaves, and you lock the first door right away. By now, the jack is back from the loo. You lock the cabinets, put the chair back, and go out the window, quiet-like.\" \"That\u0027s the lay?\" Clean Willy said doubtfully. \"That\u0027s the lay.\" \"You popped me out of Newgate for this?\" Clean Willy said. \"This is no shakes, to knock over a deadlurk.\" \"It\u0027s a deadlurk with a jack posted at the door, and it\u0027s quiet, you\u0027ll have to be quiet-like, all the time.\" Clean Willy grinned. \"Those keys mean a sharp vamp. You\u0027ve planned.\" \"Just do the lay,\" Pierce said, \"and quiet.\" \"Piece of cake,\" Clean Willy said. \"Keep those dubs handy,\" Agar said, pointing to the keys, \"and have the doors ready and open when I come in, or it\u0027s nommus for all of us, and we\u0027re likely ribbed by the crusher.\" \"Don\u0027t want to be nibbed,\" Willy said. \"Then look sharp, and be ready.\" Clean Willy nodded \"What\u0027s for dinner?\" he said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-great-train-robbery/page-18.html","bookId":2678,"book":{"id":2678,"title":"The Great Train Robbery","description":"Storyline: Lavish wealth and appalling poverty live side by side in Victorian London -- and Edward Pierce easily navigates both worlds.
