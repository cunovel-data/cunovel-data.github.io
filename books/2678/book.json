{"id":2678,"title":"The Great Train Robbery","description":"Storyline: Lavish wealth and appalling poverty live side by side in Victorian London -- and Edward Pierce easily navigates both worlds. Rich, handsome, and ingenious, he charms the city\u0027s most prominent citizens even as he plots the crime of his century, the daring theft of a fortune in gold. But even Pierce could not predict the consequences of an extraordinary robbery that targets the pride of England\u0027s industrial era: the mighty steam locomotive. Based on remarkable fact, and alive with the gripping suspense, surprise, and authenticity that are his trademarks, Michael Crichton\u0027s classic adventure is a breathtaking thrill-ride that races along tracks of steel at breakneck speed.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-great-train-robbery.jpg","author":"Michael Crichton","type":"Thriller","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":38,"category":{"id":12,"name":"Thriller","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
