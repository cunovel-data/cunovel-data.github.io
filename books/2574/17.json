{"id":93488,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Stripped to his underpants, lying on the examination table, Danny Torrance looked very small. He was looking up at Dr. (\"Just call me Bill\") Edmonds, who was wheeling a large black machine up beside him. Danny rolled his eyes to get a better look at it.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t let it scare you, guy,\" Bill Edmonds said. \"It\u0027s an electroencephalograph, and it doesn\u0027t hurt.\"\\n\\n \"Electro-\"\\n\\n \"We call it EEG for short. I\u0027m going to hook a bunch of wires to your head- no, not stick them in, only tape them-and the pens in this part of the gadget will record your brain waves.\"\\n\\n \"Like on `The Six Million Dollar Man\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"About the same. Would you like to be like Steve Austin when you grow up?\"\\n\\n \"No way,\" Danny said as the nurse began to tape the wires to a number of tiny shaved spots on his scalp. \"My daddy says that someday he\u0027ll get a short circuit and then he\u0027ll be up sh... he\u0027ll be up the creek.\"\\n\\n \"I know that creek well,\" Dr. Edmonds said amiably. \"I\u0027ve been up it a few times myself, sans paddle. An EEG can tell us lots of things, Danny.\"\\n\\n \"Like what?\"\\n\\n \"Like for instance if you have epilepsy. That\u0027s a little problem where-\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I know what epilespy is.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. There was a kid in my nursery school back in Vermont-I went to nursery school when I was a little kid-and he had it. He wasn\u0027t supposed to use the flashboard.\"\\n\\n \"What was that, Dan?\" He had turned on the machine. Thin lines began to trace their way across graph paper.\\n\\n \"It had all these lights, all different colors. And when you turned it on, some colors would flash but not all. And you had to count the colors and if you pushed the right button, you could turn it off. Brent couldn\u0027t use that.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because bright flashing lights sometimes cause an epileptic seizure.\"\\n\\n \"You mean using the flashboard might\u0027ve made Brent pitch a fit?\"\\n\\n Edmonds and the nurse exchanged a brief, amused glance. \"Inelegantly but accurately put, Danny.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I said you\u0027re right, except you should say `seizure\u0027 instead of `pitch a fit. \u0027 That\u0027s not nice... okay, lie just as still as a mouse now.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n \"Danny, when you have these... whatever they ares, do you ever recall seeing bright flashing lights before?\"\\n\\n \"No...,\\n\\n \"Funny noises? Ringing? Or chimes like a doorbell?\"\\n\\n \"Huh-uh.\"\\n\\n \"How about a funny smell, maybe like oranges or sawdust? Or a smell like something rotten?\"\\n\\n \"No, Sir.\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes do you feel like crying before you pass out? Even though you don\u0027t feel sad?\"\\n\\n \"No way.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s fine, then.\"\\n\\n \"Have I got epilepsy, Dr. Bill?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so, Danny. Just lie still. Almost done.\"\\n\\n The machine hummed and scratched for another five minutes and then Dr. Edmonds shut it off.\\n\\n \"All done, guy,\" Edmonds said briskly. \"Let Sally get those electrodes off you and then come into the next room. I want to have a little talk with you. Okay?\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"Sally, you go ahead and give him a tine test before he comes in.\"\\n\\n \"All right.\"\\n\\n Edmonds ripped off the long curl of paper the machine had extruded and went into the next room, looking at it.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to prick your arm just a little,\" the nurse said after Danny had pulled up his pants. \"It\u0027s to make sure you don\u0027t have TB.\"\\n\\n \"They gave me that at my school just last year,\" Danny said without much hope.\\n\\n \"But that was a long time ago and you\u0027re a big boy now, right?\"\\n\\n \"I guess so,\" Danny sighed, and offered his arm up for sacrifice.\\n\\n When he had his shirt and shoes on, he went through the sliding door and into Dr. Edmonds\u0027s office. Edmonds was sitting on the edge of his desk, swinging his legs thoughtfully.\\n\\n \"Hi, Danny.\"\\n\\n \"Hi.\"\\n\\n \"How\u0027s that hand now?\" He pointed at Danny\u0027s left hand, which was lightly bandaged.\\n\\n \"Pretty good.\"\\n\\n \"Good. I looked at your EEG and it seems fine. But I\u0027m going to send it to a friend of mine in Denver who makes his living reading those things. I just want to make sure.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Sir.\"\\n\\n \"Tell me about Tony, Dan.\"\\n\\n Danny shuffled his feet. \"He\u0027s just an invisible friend,\" he said. \"I made him up. To keep me company.\"\\n\\n Edmonds laughed and put his hands on Danny\u0027s shoulders. \"Now that\u0027s what your Mom and Dad say. But this is just between us, guy. I\u0027m your doctor. Tell me the truth and I\u0027ll promise not to tell them unless you say I can.\"\\n\\n Danny thought about it. He looked at Edmonds and then, with a small effort of concentration, he tried to catch Edmonds\u0027s thoughts or at least the color of his mood. And suddenly he got an oddly comforting image in his head: file cabinets, their doors sliding shut one after another, locking with a click. Written on the small tabs in the center of each door was: A-C, SECRET; D-G, SECRET; and so on. This made Danny feel a little easier.\\n\\n Cautiously he said: \"I don\u0027t know who Tony is.\"\\n\\n \"Is he your age?\"\\n\\n \"No. He\u0027s at least eleven. I think he might be even older. I\u0027ve never seen him right up close. He might be old enough to drive a car.\"\\n\\n \"You just see him at a distance, huh?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Sir.\"\\n\\n \"And he always comes just before you pass out?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I don\u0027t pass out. It\u0027s like I go with him. And he shows me things.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of things?\"\\n\\n \"Well...\" Danny debated for a moment and then told Edmonds about Daddy\u0027s trunk with all his writing in it, and about how the movers hadn\u0027t lost it between Vermont and\\n\\n Colorado after all. It had been right under the stairs all along.\\n\\n \"And your daddy found it where Tony said he would?\"\\n\\n \"Oh yes, sir. Only Tony didn\u0027t tell me. He showed me.\"\\n\\n \"I understand. Danny, what did Tony show you last night? When you locked yourself in the bathroom?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t remember,\" Danny said quickly.\\n\\n \"Are you sure?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n \"A moment ago I said you locked the bathroom door. But that wasn\u0027t right, was it? Tony locked the door.\"\\n\\n \"No, sir. Tony couldn\u0027t lock the door because he isn\u0027t real. He wanted me to do it, so I did. I locked it.\"\\n\\n \"Does Tony always show you where lost things are?\"\\n\\n \"No, sir. Sometimes he shows me things that are going to happen.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. Like one time Tony showed me the amusements and\\n\\n wild animal park in Great Barrington. Tony said Daddy was going to take me there for my birthday. He did, too.\"\\n\\n \"What else does he show you?\"\\n\\n Danny frowned. \"Signs. He\u0027s always showing me stupid old signs. And I can\u0027t read them, hardly ever.\"\\n\\n \"Why do you suppose Tony would do that, Danny?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" Danny brightened. \"But my daddy and mommy are teaching me to read, and I\u0027m trying real hard.\"\\n\\n \"So you can read Tony\u0027s signs.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I really want to learn. But that too, yeah.\"\\n\\n \"Do you like Tony, Danny?\"\\n\\n Danny looked at the tile floor and said nothing.\\n\\n \"Danny?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s hard to tell,\" Danny said. \"I used to. I used to hope he\u0027d come every day, because he always showed me good things, especially since Mommy and Daddy don\u0027t think about DIVORCE anymore.\" Dr. Edmonds\u0027s gaze sharpened, but Danny didn\u0027t notice. He was looking hard at the floor, concentrating on expressing himself. \"But now whenever he comes he shows me bad things. Awful things. Like in the bathroom last night. The things he shows me, they sting me like those wasps stung me. Only Tony\u0027s things sting me up here.\" He cocked a finger gravely at his temple, a small boy unconsciously burlesquing suicide.\\n\\n \"What things, Danny?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t remember!\" Danny cried out, agonized. \"I\u0027d tell you if I could! It\u0027s like I can\u0027t remember because it\u0027s so bad I don\u0027t want to remember. All I can remember when I wake up is REDRUM.\"\\n\\n \"Red drum or red rum?\"\\n\\n \"Rum.,\u0027\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that, Danny?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"Danny?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir?\"\\n\\n \"Can you make Tony come now?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. He doesn\u0027t always come. I don\u0027t even know if I want him to come anymore.\"\\n\\n \"Try, Danny. I\u0027ll be right here.\"\\n\\n Danny looked at Edmonds doubtfully. Edmonds nodded encouragement.\\n\\n Danny let out a long, sighing breath and nodded. \"But I don\u0027t know if it will work. I never did it with anyone looking at me before. And Tony doesn\u0027t always come, anyway.\"\\n\\n \"If he doesn\u0027t, he doesn\u0027t,\" Edmonds said. \"I just want you to try.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n He dropped his gaze to Edmonds\u0027s slowly swinging loafers and cast his mind outward toward his mommy and daddy. They were here someplace... right beyond that wall with the picture on it, as a matter of fact. In the waiting room where they had come in. Sitting side by side but not talking. Leafing through magazines. Worried. About him.\\n\\n He concentrated harder, his brow furrowing, trying to get Into the feeling of his mommy\u0027s thoughts. It was always harder when they weren\u0027t right there in the room with him. Then he began to get it. Mommy was thinking about a sister. Her sister. The sister was dead. His mommy was thinking that was the main thing that turned her mommy into such a\\n\\n (hitch?)\\n\\n into such an old biddy. Because her sister had died. As a little girl she was\\n\\n (hit by a car oh god i could never stand anything like that again like aileen but what if he\u0027s sick really sick cancer spinal meningitis leukemia brain tumor like john gunther\u0027s son or muscular dystrophy oh jeez kids his age get leukemia all the time radium treatments chemotherapy we couldn\u0027t afford anything like that but of course they just can\u0027t turn you out to die on the street can they and anyway he\u0027s all right all right all right you really shouldn\u0027t let yourself think)\\n\\n (Danny-)\\n\\n (about aileen and)\\n\\n (Dannee-)\\n\\n (that car)\\n\\n (Dannee-)\\n\\n But Tony wasn\u0027t there. Only his voice. And as it faded, Danny followed it down into darkness, falling and tumbling down some magic hole between Dr. Bill\u0027s swinging loafers, past a loud knocking sound, further, a bathtub cruised silently by in the darkness with some horrible thing lolling in it, past a sound like sweetly chiming church bells, past a clock under a dome of glass.\\n\\n Then the dark was pierced feebly by a single light, festooned with cobwebs. The weak glow disclosed a stone floor that looked damp and unpleasant. Somewhere not far distant was a steady mechanical roaring sound, but muted, not frightening. Soporific. It was the thing that would be forgotten, Danny thought with dreamy surprise.\\n\\n As his eyes adjusted to the gloom he could see Tony just ahead of him, a silhouette. Tony was looking at something and Danny strained his eyes to see what it was.\\n\\n (Your daddy. See your daddy?)\\n\\n Of course he did. How could he have missed him, even in the basement light\u0027s feeble glow? Daddy was kneeling on the floor, casting the beam of a flashlight over old cardboard boxes and wooden crates. The cardboard boxes were mushy and old; some of them had split open and spilled drifts of paper onto the floor. Newspapers, books, printed pieces of paper that looked like bills. His daddy was examining them with great interest. And then Daddy looked up and shone his flashlight in another direction. Its beam of light impaled another book, a large white one bound with gold string. The cover looked like white leather. It was a scrapbook. Danny suddenly needed to cry out to his daddy, to tell him to leave that book alone, that some books should not be opened. But his daddy was climbing toward it.\\n\\n The mechanical roaring sound, which he now recognized as the boiler at the Overlook which Daddy checked three or four times every day, had developed an ominous, rhythmic hitching. It began to sound like... like pounding. And the smell of mildew and wet, rotting paper was changing to something else-the high, junipery smell of the Bad Stuff. It hung around his daddy like a vapor as he reached for the book... and grasped it.\\n\\n Tony was somewhere in the darkness\\n\\n (This inhuman place makes human monsters. This inhuman place)\\n\\n repeating the same incomprehensible thing over and over.\\n\\n (makes human monsters.)\\n\\n Falling through darkness again, now accompanied by the heavy, pounding thunder that was no longer the boiler but the sound of a whistling mallet striking silkpapered walls, knocking out whiffs of plaster dust. Crouching helplessly on the blue-black woven jungle rug.\\n\\n (Come out)\\n\\n (This inhuman place)\\n\\n (and take your medicine!)\\n\\n (makes human monsters.)\\n\\n With a gasp that echoed in his own head he jerked himself out of the darkness. Hands were on him and at first he shrank back, thinking that the dark thing in the Overlook of Tony\u0027s world had somehow followed him back into the world of real things-and then Dr. Edmonds was saying: \"You\u0027re all right, Danny. You\u0027re all right. Everything is fine.\"\\n\\n Danny recognized the doctor, then his surroundings in the office. He began to shudder helplessly. Edmonds held him.\\n\\n When the reaction began to subside, Edmonds asked, \"You said something about monsters, Danny-what was it?\"\\n\\n \"This inhuman place,\" he said gutturally. \"Tony told me... this inhuman place... makes... makes...\" He shook his head. \"Can\u0027t remember.\"\\n\\n \"Try!\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Did Tony come?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"What did he show you?\"\\n\\n \"Dark. Pounding. I don\u0027t remember.\"\\n\\n \"Where were you?\"\\n\\n \"Leave me alone! I don\u0027t remember! Leave me alone!\" He began to sob helplessly in fear and frustration. It was all gone, dissolved into a sticky mess like a wet bundle of paper, the memory unreadable.\\n\\n Edmonds went to the water cooler and got him a paper cup of water. Danny drank it and Edmonds got him another one.\\n\\n \"Better?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Danny, I don\u0027t want to badger you... tease you about this, I mean. But can you remember anything about before Tony came?\"\\n\\n \"My mommy,\" Danny said slowly. \"She\u0027s worried about me.\"\\n\\n \"Mothers always are, guy.\"\\n\\n \"No... she had a sister that died when she was a little girl. Aileen. She was thinking about how Aileen got hit by a car and that made her worried about me. I don\u0027t remember anything else.\"\\n\\n Edmonds was looking at him sharply. \"Just now she was thinking that? Out in the waiting room?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n \"Danny, how would you know that?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Danny said wanly. \"The shining, I guess.\"\\n\\n \"The what?\"\\n\\n Danny shook his head very slowly. \"I\u0027m awful tired. Can\u0027t I go see my mommy and daddy? I don\u0027t want to answer any more questions. I\u0027m tired. And my stomach hurts.\"\\n\\n \"Are you going to throw up?\"\\n\\n \"No, sir. I just want to go see my mommy and daddy.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, Dan.\" Edmonds stood up. \"You go on out and see them for a minute, then send them in so I can talk to them. Okay?\u0027,\u0027\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n \"There are books out there to look at. You like books, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" Danny said dutifully.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a good boy, Danny.\"\\n\\n Danny gave him a faint smile.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t find a thing wrong with him,\" Dr. Edmonds said to the Torrances. \"Not physically. Mentally, he\u0027s bright and rather too imaginative. It happens. Children have to grow into their imaginations like a pair of oversized shoes. Danny\u0027s is still way too big for him. Ever had his IQ tested?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t believe in them,\" Jack said. \"They straight-jacket the expectations of both parents and teachers.\"\\n\\n Dr. Edmonds nodded. \"That may be. But if you did test him, I think you\u0027d find he\u0027s right off the scale for his age group. His verbal ability, for a boy who is five going on six, is amazing.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t talk down to him,\" Jack said with a trace of pride.\\n\\n \"I doubt if you\u0027ve ever had to in order to make yourself understood.\" Edmonds paused, fiddling with a pen. \"He went into a trance while I was with him. At my request. Exactly as you described him in the bathroom last night. All his muscles went lax, his body slumped, his eyeballs rotated outward. Textbook autohypnosis. I was amazed. I still am.\"\\n\\n The Torrances sat forward. \"What happened?\" Wendy asked tensely, and Edmonds carefully related Danny\u0027s trance, the muttered phrase from which Edmonds had only been able to pluck the word \"monsters,\" the \"dark,\" the \"pounding.\" The aftermath of tears, near-hysteria, and nervous stomach.\\n\\n \"Tony again,\" Jack said.\\n\\n \"What does it mean?\" Wendy asked. \"Have you any idea?\"\\n\\n \"A few. You might not like them.\"\\n\\n \"Go ahead anyway,\" Jack told him.\\n\\n \"From what Danny told me, his `invisible friend\u0027 was truly a friend until you folks moved out here from New England. Tony has only become a threatening figure since that move. The pleasant interludes have become nightmarish, even more frightening to your son because he can\u0027t remember exactly what the nightmares are about. That\u0027s common enough. We all remember our pleasant dreams more clearly than the scary ones. There seems to be a buffer somewhere between the conscious and the subconscious, and one hell of a bluenose lives in there. This censor only lets through a small amount, and often what does come through is only symbolic. That\u0027s oversimplified Freud, but it does pretty much describe what we know of the mind\u0027s interaction with itself.\"\\n\\n \"You think moving has upset Danny that badly?\" Wendy asked.\\n\\n \"It may have, if the move took place under traumatic circumstances,\" Edmonds said. \"Did it?\"\\n\\n Wendy and Jack exchanged a glance.\\n\\n \"I was teaching at a prep school,\" Jack said slowly. \"I lost my job.\"\\n\\n \"I see,\" Edmonds said. He put the pen he bad been playing with firmly back in its holder. \"There\u0027s more here, I\u0027m afraid. It may be painful to you. Your son seems to believe you two have seriously contemplated divorce. He spoke of it in an offhand way, but only because he believes you are no longer considering it.\"\\n\\n Jack\u0027s mouth dropped open, and Wendy recoiled as if slapped. The blood drained from her face.\\n\\n \"We never even discussed it!\" she said. \"Not in front of him, not even in front of each other! We-\"\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s best if you understand everything, Doctor,\" Jack said. \"Shortly after Danny was born, I became an alcoholic. I\u0027d had a drinking problem all the way through college, it subsided a little after Wendy and I met, cropped up worse than ever after Danny was born and the writing I consider to be my real work was going badly. When Danny was three and a half, he spilled some beer on a bunch of papers I was working on... papers I was shuffling around, anyway... and I... well... oh shit.\" His voice broke, but his eyes remained dry and unflinching. \"It sounds so goddam beastly said out loud. I broke his arm turning him around to spank him. Three months later I gave up drinking. I haven\u0027t touched it since.\"\\n\\n \"I see,\" Edmonds said neutrally. \"I knew the arm had been broken, of course. It was set well.\" He pushed back from his desk a little and crossed his legs. \"If I may be frank, it\u0027s obvious that he\u0027s been in no way abused since then. Other than the stings, there\u0027s nothing on him but the normal bruises and scabs that any kid has in abundance.\"\\n\\n \"Of course not,\" Wendy said hotly. \"Jack didn\u0027t mean-\"\\n\\n \"No, Wendy,\" Jack said. \"I meant to do it. I guess someplace inside I really did mean to do that to him. Or something even worse.\" He looked back at Edmonds again. \"You know something, Doctor? This is the first time the word divorce has been mentioned between us. And alcoholism. And child-beating. Three firsts in five minutes.\"\\n\\n \"That may be at the root of the problem,\" Edmonds said. \"I am not a psychiatrist. If you want Danny to see a child psychiatrist, I can recommend a good one who works out of the Mission Ridge Medical Center in Boulder. But I am fairly confident of my diagnosis. Danny is an intelligent, imaginative, perceptive boy. I don\u0027t believe he would have been as upset by your marital problems as you believed. Small children are great accepters. They don\u0027t understand shame, or the need to hide things.\"\\n\\n Jack was studying his hands. Wendy took one of them and squeezed it.\\n\\n \"But he sensed the things that were wrong. Chief among them from his point of view was not the broken arm but the broken-or breaking-link between you two. He mentioned divorce to me, but not the broken arm. When my nurse mentioned the set to him, he simply shrugged if off. It was no pressure thing. `It happened a long time ago\u0027 is what I think he said.\"\\n\\n \"That kid,\" Jack muttered. His jaws were clamped together, the muscles in the cheeks standing out. \"We don\u0027t deserve him.\"\\n\\n \"You have him, all the same,\" Edmonds said dryly. \"At any rate, he retires into a fantasy world from time to time. Nothing unusual about that; lots of kids do. As I recall, I had my own invisible friend when I was Danny\u0027s age, a talking rooster named Chug-Chug. Of course no one could see Chug-Chug but me. I had two older brothers who often left me behind, and in such a situation Chug-Chug came in mighty handy. And of course you two must understand why Danny\u0027s invisible friend is named Tony instead of Mike or Hal or Dutch.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Wendy said.\\n\\n \"Have you ever pointed it out to him?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Jack said. \"Should we?\"\\n\\n \"Why bother? Let him realize it in his own time, by his own logic. You see, Danny\u0027s fantasies were considerably deeper than those that grow around the ordinary invisible friend syndrome, but he felt he needed Tony that much more. Tony would come and show him pleasant things. Sometimes amazing things. Always good things. Once Tony showed him where Daddy\u0027s lost trunk was... under the stairs. Another time Tony showed him that Mommy and Daddy were going to take him to an amusement park for his birthday-\"\\n\\n \"At Great Barrington!\" Wendy cried. \"But how could he know those things? It\u0027s eerie, the things he comes out with sometimes. Almost as if-\"\\n\\n \"He had second sight?\" Edmonds asked, smiling.\\n\\n \"He was born with a caul,\" Wendy said weakly.\\n\\n Edmonds\u0027s smile became a good, hearty laugh. Jack and Wendy exchanged a glance and then also smiled, both of them amazed at how easy it was. Danny\u0027s occasional \"lucky guesses\" about things was something else they had not discussed much.\\n\\n \"Next you\u0027ll be telling me he can levitate,\" Edmonds said, still smiling. \"No, no, no, I\u0027m afraid not. It\u0027s not extrasensory but good old human perception, which in Danny\u0027s case is unusually keen. Mr. Torrance, he knew your trunk was under the stairs because you had looked everywhere else. Process of elimination, what? It\u0027s so simple Ellery Queen would laugh at it. Sooner or later you would have thought of it yourself.\\n\\n \"As for the amusement park at Great Barrington, whose idea was that originally? Yours or his?\"\\n\\n \"His, of course,\" Wendy said. \"They advertised on all the morning children\u0027s programs. He was wild to go. But the thing is, Doctor, we couldn\u0027t afford to take him. And we had told him so.\"\\n\\n \"Then a men\u0027s magazine I\u0027d sold a story to back in 1971 sent a check for fifty dollars,\" Jack said. \"They were reprinting the story in an annual, or something. So we decided to spend it on Danny.\"\\n\\n Edmonds shrugged. \"Wish fulfillment plus a lucky coincidence.\"\\n\\n \"Goddammit, I bet that\u0027s just right,\" Jack said.\\n\\n Edmonds smiled a little. \"And Danny himself told me that Tony often showed him things that never occurred. Visions based on faulty perception, that\u0027s all. Danny is doing subconsciously what these so-called mystics and mind readers do quite consciously and cynically. I admire him for it. If life doesn\u0027t cause him to retract his antennae, I think he\u0027ll be quite a man.\"\\n\\n Wendy nodded-of course she thought Danny would be quite a man-but the doctor\u0027s explanation struck her as glib. It tasted more like margarine than butter. Edmonds had not lived with them. He had not been there when Danny found lost buttons, told her that maybe the TV Guide was under the bed, that he thought he better wear his rubbers to nursery school even though the sun was out... and later that day they had walked home under her umbrella through the pouringrain. Edmonds couldn\u0027t know of the curious way Danny had of preguessing them both. She would decide to have an unusual evening cup of tea, go out in the kitchen and find her cup out with a tea bag in it. She would remember that the books were due at the library and find them all neatly piled up on the hall table, her library card on top. Or Jack would take it into his head to wax the Volkswagen and find Danny already out there, listening to tinny top-forty music on his crystal radio as he sat on the curb to watch.\\n\\n Aloud she said, \"Then why the nightmares now? Why did Tony tell him to lock the bathroom door?\"\\n\\n \"I believe it\u0027s because Tony has outlived his usefulness,\" Edmonds said. \"He was born-Tony, not Danny-at a time when you and your husband were straining to keep your marriage together. Your husband was drinking too much. There was the incident of the broken arm. The ominous quiet between you.\"\\n\\n Ominous quiet, yes, that phrase was the real thing, anyway. The stiff, tense meals where the only conversation had been please pass the butter or Danny, eat the rest of your carrots or may I be excused, please. The nights when Jack was gone and she had lain down, dry-eyed, on the couch while Danny watched TV. The mornings when she and Jack had stalked around each other like two angry cats with a quivering, frightened mouse between them. It all rang true;\\n\\n (dear God, do old scars ever stop hurting?)\\n\\n horribly, horribly true.\\n\\n Edmonds resumed, \"But things have changed. You know, schizoid behavior is a pretty common thing in children. It\u0027s accepted, because all we adults have this unspoken agreement that children are lunatics. They have invisible friends. They may go and sit in the closet when they\u0027re depressed, withdrawing from the world. They attach talismanic importance to a special blanket, or a teddy bear, or a stuffed tiger. They suck their thumbs. When an adult sees things that aren\u0027t there, we consider him ready for the rubber room. When a child says he\u0027s seen a troll in his bedroom or a vampire outside the window, we simply smile indulgently. We have a one-sentence explanation that explains the whole range of such phenomena in children-\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll grow out of it,\" Jack said.\\n\\n Edmonds blinked. \"My very words,\" he said. \"Yes. Now I would guess that Danny was in a pretty good position to develop a full-fledged psychosis. Unhappy home life, a big imagination, the invisible friend who was so real to him that he nearly became real to you. Instead of `growing out of\u0027 is childhood schizophrenia, he might well have grown into it.\"\\n\\n \"And become autistic?\" Wendy asked. She had read about autism. The word itself frightened her; it sounded like dread and white silence.\\n\\n \"Possible but not necessarily. He might simply have entered Tony\u0027s world someday and never come back to what he calls `real things. \u0027 \"\\n\\n \"God,\" Jack said.\\n\\n \"But now the basic situation has changed drastically. Mr. Torrance no longer drinks. You are in a new place where conditions have forced the three of you into a tighter family unit than ever before-certainly tighter than my own, where my wife and kids may see me for only two or three hours a day. To my mind, he is in the perfect healing situation. And I think the very fact that he is able to differentiate so sharply between Tony\u0027s world and `real things\u0027 says a lot about the fundamentally healthy state of his mind. He says that you two are no longer considering divorce. Is he as right as I think he is?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Wendy said, and Jack squeezed her hand tightly, almost painfully. She squeezed back.\\n\\n Edmonds nodded. \"He really doesn\u0027t need Tony anymore. Danny is flushing him out of his system. Tony no longer brings pleasant visions but hostile nightmares that are too frightening for him to remember except fragmentarily. He internalized Tony during a difficult-desperate-life situation, and Tony is not leaving easily. But he is leaving. Your son is a little like a junkie kicking the habit.\"\\n\\n He stood up, and the Torrances stood also.\\n\\n \"As I said, I\u0027m not a psychiatrist. If the nightmares are still continuing when your job at the Overlook ends next spring, Mr. Torrance, I would strongly urge you to take him to this man in Boulder.\"\\n\\n \"I will.\"\\n\\n \"Well, let\u0027s go out and tell him he can go home,\" Edmonds said.\\n\\n \"I want to thank you,\" Jack told him painfully. \"I feel better about all this than I have in a very long time.\"\\n\\n \"So do I,\" Wendy said.\\n\\n At the door, Edmonds paused and looked at Wendy. \"Do you or did you have a sister, Mrs. Torrance? Named Aileen?\"\\n\\n Wendy looked at him, surprised. \"Yes, I did. She was killed outside our home in Somersworth, New Hampshire, when she was six and I was ten. She chased a ball into the street and was struck by a delivery van.\"\\n\\n \"Does Danny know that?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t think so.\"\\n\\n \"He says you were thinking about her in the waiting room.\"\\n\\n \"I was,\" Wendy said slowly. \"For the first time in... oh, I don\u0027t know how long.\"\\n\\n \"Does the word \u0027redrum\u0027 mean anything to either of you?\"\\n\\n Wendy shook her head but Jack said, \"He mentioned that word last night, just before he went to sleep. Red drum.\"\\n\\n \"No, rum,\" Edmonds corrected. \"He was quite emphatic about that. Rum. As in the drink. The alcoholic drink.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" Jack said. \"It fits in, doesn\u0027t it?\" He took his handkerchief out of his back pocket and wiped his lips with it.\\n\\n \"Does the phrase `the shining\u0027 mean anything to you?\"\\n\\n This time they both shook their heads.\\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t matter, I guess,\" Edmonds said. He opened the door into the waiting room. \"Anybody here named Danny Torrance that would like to go home?\"\\n\\n \"Hi, Daddy! Hi, Mommy!\" He stood up from the small table where he had been leafing slowly through a copy of Where the Wild Things Are and muttering the words he knew aloud.\\n\\n He ran to Jack, who scooped him up. Wendy ruffled his hair.\\n\\n Edmonds peered at him. \"If you don\u0027t love your mommy and daddy, you can stay with good old Bill.\"\\n\\n \"No, sir!\" Danny said emphatically. He slung one arm around Jack\u0027s neck, one arm around Wendy\u0027s, and looked radiantly happy.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" Edmonds said, smiling. He looked at Wendy. \"You call if you have any problems.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think you will,\" Edmonds said, smiling. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shining-the-shining-1/page-17.html","bookId":2574,"book":{"id":2574,"title":"The Shining (The Shining #1)","description":"Storyline: Danny was only five years old but in the words of old Mr Halloran he was a \u0027shiner\u0027, aglow with psychic voltage.
