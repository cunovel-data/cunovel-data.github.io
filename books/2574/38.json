{"id":93509,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"(!!! The boiler the goddam boiler!!!)\\n\\n The thought came into Jack Torrance\u0027s mind full-blown, edged in bright, warning red. On its heels, the voice of Watson:\\n\\n (If you forget it\u0027ll just creep an creep and like as not you an your fambly wilt end up on the fuckin moon... she\u0027s rated for two-fifty but she\u0027d blow long before that now... I\u0027d be scared to come down and stand next to her at a hundred and eighty.)\\n\\n He\u0027d been down here all night, poring over the boxes of old records, possessed by a frantic feeling that time was getting short and he would have to hurry. Still the vital clues, the connections that would make everything clear, eluded him. His fingers were yellow and grimy with crumbling old paper. And he\u0027d become so absorbed he hadn\u0027t checked the boiler once. He\u0027d dumped it the previous evening around six o\u0027clock, when he first came down. It was now...\\n\\n He looked at his watch and jumped up, kicking over e stack of old invoices.\\n\\n Christ, it was quarter of five in the morning.\\n\\n Behind him, the furnace kicked on. The boiler was making a groaning, whistling sound.\\n\\n He ran to it. His face, which had become thinner in the last month or so, was now heavily shadowed with beardstubble and he had a hollow concentration-camp look.\\n\\n The boiler pressure gauge stood at two hundred and ten pounds per square inch. He fancied he could almost see the sides of the old patched and welded boiler heaving out with the lethal strain.\\n\\n (She creeps... I\u0027d be scared to come down and stand next to her at a hundred and eighty...)\\n\\n Suddenly a cold and tempting inner voice spoke to him.\\n\\n (Let it go. Go get Wendy and Danny and get the fuck out of here. Let it blow sky-high.)\\n\\n He could visualize the explosion. A double thunderclap that would first rip the heart from this place, then the soul. The boiler would go with an orangeviolet flash that would rain hot and burning shrapnel all over the cellar. In his mind he could see the redhot trinkets of metal careening from floor to walls to ceiling like strange billiard balls, whistling jagged death through the air. Some of them, surely, would whizz right through that stone arch, light on the old papers on the other side, and they would burn merry hell. Destroy the secrets, burn the clues, it\u0027s a mystery no living hand will ever solve. Then the gas explosion, a great rumbling crackle of flame, a giant pilot light that would turn the whole center of the hotel into a broiler. Stairs and hallways and ceilings and rooms aflame like the castle in the last reel of a Frankenstein movie. The flame spreading into the wings, hurrying up the black-and-blue-twined carpets like eager guests. The silk wallpaper charring and curling. There were no sprinklers, only those outmoded hoses and no one to use them. And there wasn\u0027t a fire engine in the world that could get here before late March. Burn, baby, burn. In twelve hours there would be nothing left but the bare bones.\\n\\n The needle on the gauge had moved up to two-twelve. The boiler was creaking and groaning like an old woman trying to get out of bed. Hissing jets of steam had begun to play around the edges of old patches; beads of solder had begun to sizzle.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t see, he didn\u0027t hear. Frozen with his hand on the valve that would dump off the pressure and damp the fire, Jack\u0027s eyes glittered from their sockets like sapphires.\\n\\n (It\u0027s my last chance.)\\n\\n The only thing not cashed in now was the life-insurance policy he had taken out jointly with Wendy in the summer between his first and second years at Stovington. Forty-thousand-dollar death benefit, double indemnity if he or she died in a train crash, a plane crash, or a fire. Seven-come-eleven, die the secret death and win a hundred dollars.\\n\\n (A fire... eighty thousand dollars.)\\n\\n They would have time to get out. Even if they were sleeping, they would have time to get out. He believed that. And he didn\u0027t think the hedges or anything else would try to hold them back if the Overlook was going up in flames.\\n\\n (Flames.)\\n\\n The needle inside the greasy, almost opaque dial bad danced up to two hundred and fifteen pounds per square inch.\\n\\n Another memory occurred to him, a childhood memory. There had been a wasps\u0027 nest in the lower branches of their apple tree behind the house. One of his older brothers-he couldn\u0027t remember which one now-had been stung while swinging in the old tire Daddy had hung from one of the tree\u0027s lower branches. It had been late summer, when wasps tend to be at their ugliest.\\n\\n Their father, just home from work, dressed in his whites, the smell of beer hanging around his face in a fine mist, had gathered all three boys, Brett, Mike, and little Jacky, and told them he was going to get rid of the wasps.\\n\\n \"Now watch,\" he had said, smiling and staggering a little (he hadn\u0027t been using the cane then, the collision with the milk truck was years in the future). \"Maybe you\u0027ll learn something. My father showed me this.\"\\n\\n He had raked a big pile of rain-dampened leaves under the branch where the wasps\u0027 nest rested, a deadlier fruit than the shrunken but tasty apples their tree usually produced in late September, which was then still half a month away. He lit the leaves. The day was clear and windless. The leaves smoldered but didn\u0027t really burn, and they made a smell-a fragrancethat had echoed back to him each fall when men in Saturday pants and light Windbreakers raked leaves together and burned them. A sweet smell with a bitter undertone, rich and evocative. The smoldering leaves produced great rafts of smoke that drifted up to obscure the nest.\\n\\n Their father had let the leaves smolder all that afternoon, drinking beer on the porch and dropping the empty Black Label cans into his wife\u0027s plastic floorbucket while his two older sons flanked him and little Jacky sat on the steps at his feet, playing with his Bolo Bouncer and singing monotonously over and over: \"Your cheating heart... will make you weep... your cheating heart... is gonna tell on you.\"\\n\\n At quarter of six, just before supper, Daddy had gone out to the apple tree with his sons grouped carefully behind him. In one hand he had a garden hoe. He knocked the leaves apart, leaving little clots spread around to smolder and die. Then he reached the hoe handle up, weaving and blinking, and after two or three tries he knocked the nest to the ground.\\n\\n The boys fled for the safety of the porch, but Daddy only stood over the nest, swaying and blinking down at it. Jacky crept back to see. A few wasps were crawling sluggishly over the paper terrain of their property, but they were not trying to fly. From the inside of the nest, the black and alien place, came a never-to-be-forgotten sound: a low, somnolent buzz, like the sound of hightension wires.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t they try to sting you, Daddy?\" he had asked.\\n\\n \"The smoke makes em drunk, Jacky. Go get my gascan.\"\\n\\n He ran to fetch it. Daddy doused the nest with amber gasoline.\\n\\n \"Now step away, Jacky, unless you want to lose your eyebrows.\"\\n\\n He had stepped away. From somewhere in the voluminous folds of his white overblouse, Daddy had produced a wooden kitchen match. He lit it with his thumbnail and flung it onto the nest. There had been a white-orange explosion, almost soundless in its ferocity. Daddy had stepped away, cackling wildly. The wasps\u0027 nest had gone up in no time.\\n\\n \"Fire,\" Daddy had said, turning to Jacky with a smile. \"Fire will kill anything.\"\\n\\n After supper the boys had come out in the day\u0027s waning light to stand solemnly around the charred and blackened nest. From the hot interior had come the sound of wasp bodies popping like corn.\\n\\n The pressure gauge stood at two-twenty. A low iron wailing sound was building up in the guts of the thing. Jets of steam stood out erect in a hundred places like porcupine quills.\\n\\n (Fire will kill anything.)\\n\\n Jack suddenly started. He had been dozing off... and he had almost dozed himself right into kingdom cone. What in God\u0027s name had he been thinking of? Protecting the hotel was his job. He was the caretaker.\\n\\n A sweat of terror sprang to his hands so quickly that at first he missed his grip on the large valve. Then he curled his fingers around its spokes. He whirled it one turn, two, three. There was a giant hiss of steam, dragon\u0027s breath. A warm tropical mist rose from beneath the boiler and veiled him. For a moment he could no longer see the dial but thought he must have waited too long; the groaning, clanking sound inside the boiler increased, followed by a series of heavy rattling sounds and the wrenching screech of metal.\\n\\n When some of the steam blew away he saw that the pressure gauge had dropped back to two hundred and was still sinking. The jets of steam escaping around the soldered patches began to lose their force. The wrenching, grinding sounds began to diminish.\\n\\n One-ninety... one-eighty... one seventy-five...\\n\\n (He was going downhill, going ninety miles an hour, when the whistle broke into a scream-)\\n\\n But he didn\u0027t think it would blow now. The press was down to one-sixty.\\n\\n (-they found him in the wreck with his hand on the throttle, he was scalded to death by the steam.)\\n\\n He stepped away from the boiler, breathing hard, trembling. He looked at his hands and saw that blisters were already rising on his palms. Hell with the blisters, he thought, and laughed shakily. He had almost died with his hand on the throttle, like Casey the engineer in \"The Wreck of the Old 97.\" Worse still, he would have killed the Overlook. The final crashing failure. He had failed as a teacher, a writer, a husband, and a father. He had even failed as a drunk. But you couldn\u0027t do much better in the old failure category than to blow up the building you were supposed to be taking care of. And this was no ordinary building.\\n\\n By no means.\\n\\n Christ, but he needed a drink.\\n\\n The press had dropped down to eighty psi. Cautiously, wincing a little at the pain in his hands, he closed the dump valve again. But from now on the boiler would have to be watched more closely than ever. It might have been seriously weakened. He wouldn\u0027t trust it at more than one hundred psi for the rest of the winter. And if they were a little chilly, they would just have to grin and bear it.\\n\\n He had broken two of the blisters. His hands throbbed like rotten teeth.\\n\\n A drink. A drink would fix him up, and there wasn\u0027t a thing in the goddamn house besides cooking sherry. At this point a drink would be medicinal. That was just it, by God. An anesthetic. He had done his duty and now he could use a little anesthetic-something stronger than Excedrin. But there was nothing.\\n\\n He remembered bottles glittering in the shadows.\\n\\n He had saved the hotel. The hotel would want to reward him. He felt sure of it. He took his handkerchief out of his back pocket and went to the stairs. He rubbed at his mouth. Just a little drink. Just one. To ease the pain.\\n\\n He had served the Overlook, and now the Overlook would serve him. He was sure of it. His feet on the stair risers were quick and eager, the hurrying steps of a man who has come home from a long and bitter war. It was 5:20 A. M., MST. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shining-the-shining-1/page-38.html","bookId":2574,"book":{"id":2574,"title":"The Shining (The Shining #1)","description":"Storyline: Danny was only five years old but in the words of old Mr Halloran he was a \u0027shiner\u0027, aglow with psychic voltage.
