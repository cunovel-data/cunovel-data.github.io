{"id":93482,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"There were four bags in a pile just outside the door. Three of them were giant, battered old suitcases covered with black imitation alligator hide. The last was an oversized zipper bag with a faded tartan skin.\n \"Guess you can handle that one, can\u0027t you?\" Hallorann asked him. He picked up two of the big cases in one hand and hoisted the other under his arm.\n \"Sure,\" Danny said. He got a grip on it with both hands and followed the cook down the porch steps, trying manfully not to grunt and give away how heavy it was.\n A sharp and cutting fall wind had come up since they had arrived; it whistled across the parking lot, making Danny wince his eyes down to slits as he carried the zipper bag in front of him, bumping on his knees. A few errant aspen leaves rattled and turned across the now mostly deserted asphalt, making Danny think momentarily of that night last week when he had wakened out of his nightmare and had heard-or thought he heard, at least-Tony telling him not to go.\n Hallorann set his bags down by the trunk of a beige Plymouth Fury. \"This ain\u0027t much car,\" he confided to Danny, \"just a rental job. My Bessie\u0027s on the other end. She\u0027s a car. 1950 Cadillac, and does she run sweet? I\u0027ll tell the world. I keep her in Florida because she\u0027s too old for all this mountain climbing. You need a hand with that?\"\n \"No, sir,\" Danny said. He managed to carry it the last ten or twelve steps without grunting and set it down with a large sigh of relief.\n \"Good boy,\" Hallorann said. He produced a large key ring from the pocket of his blue serge jacket and unlocked the trunk. As he lifted the bags in he said: \"You shine on, boy. Harder than anyone I ever met in my life. And I\u0027m sixty years old this January.\"\n \"Huh?\"\n \"You got a knack,\" Hallorann said, turning to him. \"Me, I\u0027ve always called it shining. That\u0027s what my grandmother called it, too. She had it. We used to sit in the kitchen when I was a boy no older than you and have long talks without even openin our mouths.\"\n \"Really?\"\n Hallorann smiled at Danny\u0027s openmouthed, almost hungry expression and said, \"Come on up and sit in the car with me for a few minutes. Want to talk to you.\" He slammed the trunk.\n In the lobby of the Overlook, Wendy Torrance saw her son get into the passenger side of Hallorann\u0027s car as the big black cook slid in behind the wheel. A sharp pang of fear struck her and she opened her mouth to tell Jack that Hallorann had not been lying about taking their son to Florida-there was a kidnaping afoot. But they were only sitting there. She could barely see the small silhouette of her son\u0027s head, turned attentively toward Hallorann\u0027s big one. Even at this distance that small head had a set to it that she recognizedit was the way her son looked when there was something on the TV that particularly fascinated him, or when he and his father were playing old maid or idiot cribbage. Jack, who was still looking around for Ullman, hadn\u0027t noticed. Wendy kept silent, watching Hallorann\u0027s car nervously, wondering what they could possibly be talking about that would make Danny cock -his head that way.\n In the car Hallorann was saying: \"Get you kinda lonely, thinkin you were the only one?\"\n Danny, who had been frightened as well as lonely sometimes, nodded. \"Am I the only one you ever met?\" he asked.\n Hallorann laughed and shook his head. \"No, child, no. But you shine the hardest.\"\n \"Are there lots, then?\"\n \"No,\" Hallorann said, \"but you do run across them. A lot of folks, they got a little bit of shine to them. They don\u0027t oven know it. But they always seem to show up with flowers when their wives are feelin blue with the monthlies, they do good on school tests they don\u0027t even study for, they got a good idea how people are feelin as soon as they walk into a room. I come across fifty or sixty like that. But maybe only a dozen, countin my gram, that knew they was shinin.\"\n \"Wow,\" Danny said, and thought about it. Then: \"Do you know Mrs. Brant?\"\n \"Her?\" Hallorann asked scornfully. \"She don\u0027t shine. Just sends her supper back two-three times every night.\"\n \"I know she doesn\u0027t,\" Danny said earnestly. \"But do you know the man in the gray uniform that gets the cars?\"\n \"Mike? Sure, I know Mike. What about him?\"\n \"Mr. Hallorann, why would she want his pants?\"\n \"What are you talking about, boy?\"\n \"Well, when she was watching him, she was thinking she would sure like to get into his pants and I just wondered why-\"\n But he got no further. Hallorann had thrown his head back, and rich, dark laughter issued from his chest, rolling around in the car like cannonfire. The seat shook with the force of it. Danny smiled, puzzled, and at last the storm subsided by fits and starts. Hallorann produced a large silk handkerchief from his breast pocket like a white flag of surrender and wiped his streaming eyes.\n \"Boy,\" he said, still snorting a little, \"you are gonna know everything there is to know about the human condition before you make ten. I dunno if to envy you or not.\"\n \"But Mrs. Brant-\"\n \"You never mind her,\" he said. \"And don\u0027t go askin your mom, either. You\u0027d only upset her, dig what I\u0027m sayin?\"\n \"Yes, sir,\" Danny said. He dug it perfectly well. He had upset his mother that way in the past.\n \"That Mrs. Brant is just a dirty old woman with an itch, that\u0027s all you have to know.\" He looked at Danny speculatively. \"How hard can you hit, doc?\"\n \"Huh?\"\n \"Give me a blast. Think at me. I want to know if you got as much as I think you do.\"\n \"What do you want me to think?\"\n \"Anything. Just think it hard.\"\n \"Okay,\" Danny said. He considered it for a moment, then gathered his concentration and flung it out at Hallorann. He had never done anything precisely like this before, and at the last instant some instinctive part of him rose up and blunted some of the thought\u0027s raw force-he didn\u0027t want to hurt Mr. Hallorann. Still the thought arrowed out of him with a force he never would have believed. It went like a Nolan Ryan fastball with a little extra on it.\n (Gee I hope I don\u0027t hurt him)\n And the thought was:\n (!!! HI, DICK!!!)\n Hallorann winced and jerked bac kward on the seat. His teeth came together with a hard click, drawing blood from his lower lip in a thin trickle. His hands flew up involuntarily from his lap to the level of his chest and then settled back again. For a moment his eyelids fluttered limply, with no conscious control, and Danny was frightened.\n \"Mr. Hallorann? Dick? Are you okay?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Hallorann said, and laughed weakly. \"I honest to God don\u0027t. My God, boy, you\u0027re a pistol.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Danny said, more alarmed. \"Should I get my daddy? I\u0027ll run and get him.\"\n \"No, here I come. I\u0027m okay, Danny. You just sit right there. I feel a little scrambled, that\u0027s all.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t go as hard as I could,\" Danny confessed. \"I was scared to, at the last minute.\"\n \"Probably my good luck you did... my brains would be leakin out my ears.\" He saw the alarm on Danny\u0027s face and smiled. \"No harm done. What did it feel like to you?\"\n \"Like I was Nolan Ryan throwing a fastball,\" he replied promptly.\n \"You like baseball, do you?\" Hallorann was rubbing his temples gingerly.\n \"Daddy and me like the Angels,\" Danny said. \"The Red Sox in the American League East and the Angels in the West. We saw the Red Sox against Cincinnati in the World Series. I was a lot littler then. And Daddy was...\" Danny\u0027s face went dark and troubled.\n \"Was what, Dan?\"\n \"I forget,\" Danny said. He started to put his thumb in his mouth to suck it, but that was a baby trick. He put his hand back in his lap.\n \"Can you tell what your mom and dad are thinking, Danny?\" Hallorann was watching him closely.\n \"Most times, if I want to. But usually I don\u0027t try.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Well...\" he paused a moment, troubled. \"It would be like peeking into the bedroom and watching while they\u0027re doing the thing that makes babies. Do you know that thing?\"\n \"I have had acquaintance with it,\" Hallorann said gravely.\n \"They wouldn\u0027t like that. And they wouldn\u0027t like me peeking at their thinks. It would be dirty.\"\n \"I see.\"\n \"But I know how they\u0027re feeling,\" Danny said. \"I can\u0027t help that. I know how you\u0027re feeling, too. I hurt you. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"It\u0027s just a headache. I\u0027ve had hangovers that were worse. Can you read other people, Danny?\"\n \"I can\u0027t read yet at all,\" Danny said, \"except a few words. But Daddy\u0027s going to teach me this winter. My daddy used to teach reading and writing in a big school. Mostly writing, but he knows reading, too.\"\n \"I mean, can you tell what anybody is thinking?\"\n Danny thought about it.\n \"I can if it\u0027s loud,\" he said finally. \"Like Mrs. Brant and the pants. Or like once, when me and Mommy were in this big store to get me some shoes, there was this big kid looking at radios, and he was thinking about taking one without buying it. Then he\u0027d think, what if I get caught? Then he\u0027d think, I really want it. Then he\u0027d think about getting caught again. He was making himself sick about it, and he was making me sick. Mommy was talking to the man who sells the shoes so I went over and said, `Kid, don\u0027t take that radio. Go away. \u0027 And he got really scared. He went away fast.\"\n Hallorann was grinning broadly. \"I bet he did. Can you do anything else, Danny? Is it only thoughts and feelings, or is there more?\"\n Cautiously: \"Is there more for you?\"\n \"Sometimes,\" Hallorann said. \"Not often. Sometimes... sometimes there are dreams. Do you dream, Danny?\"\n \"Sometimes,\" Danny said, \"I dream when I\u0027m awake. After Tony comes.\" His thumb wanted to go into his mouth again. He had never told anyone but Mommy and Daddy about Tony. He made his thumb-sucking hand go back into his lap.\n \"Who\u0027s Tony?\"\n And suddenly Danny had one of those flashes of understanding that frightened him most of all; it was like a sudden glimpse of some incomprehensible machine that might be safe or might be deadly dangerous. He was too young to know which. He was too young to understand.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" he cried. \"You\u0027re asking me all this because you\u0027re worried, aren\u0027t you? Why are you worried about me? Why are you worried about us?\"\n Hallorann put his large dark hands on the small boy\u0027s shoulders. \"Stop,\" he said. It\u0027s probably nothin. But if it is somethin... well, you\u0027ve got a large thing in your head, Danny. You\u0027ll have to do a lot of growin yet before you catch up to it, I guess. You got to be brave about it.\"\n \"But I don\u0027t understand thingsl\" Danny burst out. \"I do but I don\u0027t! People... they feel things and I feel them, but I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m feeling!\" He looked down at his lap wretchedly. \"I wish I could read. Sometimes Tony shows me signs and I can hardly read any of them.\"\n \"Who\u0027s Tony?\" Hallorann asked again.\n \"Mommy and Daddy call him my `invisible playmate,\"\u0027 Danny said, reciting the words carefully. \"But he\u0027s really real. At least, I think he is. Sometimes, when I try real hard to understand things, he comes. He says, \u0027Danny, I want to show you something. \u0027 And it\u0027s like I pass out. Only... there are dreams, like you said.\" He looked at Hallorann and swallowed. \"They used to be nice. But now... I can\u0027t remember the word for dreams that scare you and make you cry.\"\n \"Nightmares?\" Hallorann asked.\n \"Yes. That\u0027s right. Nightmares.\"\n \"About this place? About the Overlook?\"\n Danny looked down at his thumb-sucking hand again. \"Yes,\" he whispered. Then he spoke shrilly, looking up into Hallorann\u0027s face: \"But I can\u0027t tell my daddy, and you can\u0027t, either! He has to have this job because it\u0027s the only one Uncle Al could get for him and he has to finish his play or he might start doing the Bad Thing again and I know what that is, it\u0027s getting drunk, that\u0027s what it is, it\u0027s when he used to always be drunk and that was a Bad Thing to do!\" He stopped, on the verge of tears.\n \"Shh,\" Hallorann said, and pulled Danny\u0027s face against the rough serge of his jacket. It smelled faintly of mothballs. \"That\u0027s all right, son. And if that thumb likes your mouth, let it go where it wants.\" But his face was troubled.\n He said: \"What you got, son, I call it shinin on, the Bible calls it having visions, and there\u0027s scientists that call it precognition. I\u0027ve read up on it, son. I\u0027ve studied on it. They all mean seeing the future. Do you understand that?\"\n Danny nodded against Hallorann\u0027s coat.\n \"I remember the strongest shine I ever had that way... I\u0027m not liable to forget. It was 1955. I was still in the Army then, stationed overseas in West Germany. It was an hour before supper, and I was standin by the sink, givin one of the KPs hell for takin too much of the potato along with the peel. I says, \u0027Here, lemme show you how that\u0027s done. \u0027 He held out the potato and the peeler and then the whole kitchen was gone. Bang, just like that. You say you see this guy Tony before... before you have dreams?\"\n Danny nodded.\n Hallorann put an arm around him. \"With me it\u0027s smellin oranges. All that afternoon I\u0027d been smellin them and thinkin nothin of it, because they were on the menu for that nightwe had thirty crates of Valencias. Everybody in the damn kitchen was smellin oranges that night.\n \"For a minute it was like I had just passed out. And then I heard an explosion and saw flames. There were people screaming. Sirens. And I heard this hissin noise that could only be steam. Then it seemed like I got a little closer to whatever it was and I saw a railroad car off the tracks and laying on its side with Georgia aced South Carolina Railroad written on it, and I knew like a flash that my brother Carl was on that train and it jumped the tracks and Carl was dead. Just like that. Then it was gone and here\u0027s this scared, stupid little KP in front of me, still holdin out that potato and the peeler. He says, \u0027Are you okay, Sarge?\u0027 And I says, `No. My brother\u0027s just been killed down in Georgia\u0027 And when I finally got my momma on the overseas telephone, she told me how it was.\n \"But see, boy, I already knew how it was.\"\n He shook his head slowly, as if dismissing the memory, and looked down at the wide-eyed boy.\n \"But the thing you got to remember, my boy, is this: Those things don\u0027t always come true. I remember just four years ago I had a job cookin at a boys\u0027 camp up in Maine on Long Lake. So I am sittin by the boarding gate at Logan Airport in Boston, just waiting to get on my flight, and I start to smell oranges. For the first time in maybe five years. So I say to myself, \u0027My God, what\u0027s comin on this crazy late show now?\u0027 and I got down to the bathroom and sat on one of the toilets to be private. I never did black out, but I started to get this feelin, stronger and stronger, that my plane was gonna crash. Then the feeling went away, and the smell of oranges, and I knew it was over. I went back to the Delta Airlines desk and changed my flight to one three hours later. And do you know what happened?\"\n \"What?\" Danny whispered.\n \"Nothin!\" Hallorann said, and laughed. He was relieved to see the boy smile a little, too. \"Not one single thingl That old plane landed right on time and without a single bump or bruise. So you see... sometimes those feelins don\u0027t come to anything.\"\n \"Oh,\" Danny said.\n \"Or you take the race track. I go a lot, and I usually do pretty well. I stand by the rail when they go by the starting gate, and sometimes I get a little shine about this horse or that one. Usually those feelins help me get real well. I always tell myself that someday I\u0027m gonna get three at once on three long shots and make enough on the trifecta to retire early. It ain\u0027t happened yet. But there\u0027s plenty of times I\u0027ve come home from the track on shank\u0027s mare instead of in a taxicab with my wallet swollen up. Nobody shines on all the time, except maybe for God up in heaven.\"\n \"Yes, sir,\" Danny said, thinking of the time almost a year ago when Tony had showed him a new baby lying in a crib at their house in Stovington. He had been very excited about that, and had waited, knowing that it took time, but there had been no new baby.\n \"Now you listen,\" Hallorann said, and took both of Danny\u0027s hands in his own. \"I\u0027ve had some bad dreams here, and I\u0027ve had some bad feelins. I\u0027ve worked here two seasons now and maybe a dozen times I\u0027ve had... well, nightmares. And maybe half a dozen times I\u0027ve thought I\u0027ve seen things. No, I won\u0027t say what. It ain\u0027t for a little boy like you. Just nasty things. Once it had something to do with those damn hedges clipped to look like animals. Another time there was a maid, Delores Vickery her name was, and she had a little shine to her, but I don\u0027t think she knew it. Mr. Ullman fired her... do you know what that is, doc?\"\n \"Yes, sir,\" Danny said candidly, \"my daddy got fired from his teaching job and that\u0027s why we\u0027re in Colorado, I guess.\"\n \"Well, Ullman fired her on account of her saying she\u0027d seen something in one of the rooms where... well, where a bad thing happened. That was in Room 217, and I want you to promise me you won\u0027t go in there, Danny. Not all winter. Steer right clear.\"\n \"All right,\" Danny said. \"Did the lady-the maiden-did she ask you to go look?\"\n \"Yes, she did. And there was a bad thing there. But... I don\u0027t think it was a bad thing that could hurt anyone, Danny, that\u0027s what I\u0027m tryin to say. People who shine can sometimes see things that are gonna happen, and I think sometimes they can see things that did happen. But they\u0027re just like pictures in a book. Did you ever see a picture in a book that scared you, Danny?\"\n \"Yes,\" he said, thinking of the story of Bluebeard and the picture where Bluebeard\u0027s new wife opens the door and sees all the heads.\n \"But you knew it couldn\u0027t hurt you, didn\u0027t you?\"\n \"Ye-ess...\" Danny said, a little dubious.\n \"Well, that\u0027s how it is in this hotel. I don\u0027t know why, but it seems that all the bad things that ever happened here, there\u0027s little pieces of those things still layin around like fingernail clippins or the boogers that somebody nasty just wiped under a chair. I don\u0027t know why it should just be here, there\u0027s bad goings-on in just about every hotel in the world, I guess, and I\u0027ve worked in a lot of them and had no trouble. Only here. But Danny, I don\u0027t think those things can hurt anybody.\" He emphasized each word in the sentence with a mild shake of the boy\u0027s shoulders. \"So if you should see something, in a hallway or a room or outside by those hedges... just look the other way and when you look back, it\u0027ll be gone. Are you diggin me?\"\n \"Yes,\" Danny said. He felt much better, soothed. He got up on his knees, kissed Hallorann\u0027s cheek, and gave him a big hard hug. Hallorann hugged him back.\n When he released the boy he asked: \"Your folks, they don\u0027t shine, do they?\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t think so.\"\n \"I tried them like I did you,\" Hallorann said. \"Your momma jumped the tiniest bit. I think all mothers shine a little, you know, at least until their kids grow up enough to watch out for themselves. Your dad...\"\n Hallorann paused momentarily. He had probed at the boy\u0027s father and he just didn\u0027t know. It wasn\u0027t like meeting someone who had the shine, or someone who definitely did not. Poking at Danny\u0027s father had been... strange, as if Jack Torrance had something-something-that he was hiding. Or something he was holding in so deeply submerged in himself that it was impossible to get to.\n \"I don\u0027t think he shines at all,\" Hallorann finished. \"So you don\u0027t worry about them. You just take care of you. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything here that can hurt you. So just be cool, okay?\"\n \"Okay.\"\n \"Danny! Hey, doc!\"\n Danny looked around. \"That\u0027s Mom. She wants me. I have to go.\"\n \"I know you do,\" Hallorann said. \"You have a good time here, Danny. Best you can, anyway.\"\n \"I will. Thanks, Mr. Hallorann. I feel a lot better.\"\n The smiling thought came in his mind:\n (Dick, to my friends) (Yes, Dick, okay)\n Their eyes met, and Dick Hallorann winked.\n Danny scrambled across the seat of the car and opened the passenger side door. As he was getting out, Hallorann said, \"Danny?\"\n \"What?\"\n \"If there Is trouble... you give a call. A big loud holler like the one you gave a few minutes ago. I might hear you even way down in Florida. And if I do, I\u0027ll come on the run.\"\n \"Okay,\" Danny said, and smiled.\n \"You take care, big boy.\"\n \"I will.\"\n Danny slammed the door and ran across the parking lot toward the porch, where Wendy stood holding her elbows against the chill wind. Hallorann watched, the big grin slowly fading.\n I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything here that can hurt you.\n I don\u0027t think.\n But what if he was wrong? He had known that this was his last season at the Overlook ever since he had seen that thing in the bathtub of Room 217. It had been worse than any picture in any book, and from here the boy running to his mother looked so small...\n I don\u0027t think-\n His eyes drifted down to the topiary animals.\n Abruptly he started the car and put it in gear and drove away, trying not to look back. And of course he did, and of course the porch was empty. They had gone back inside. It was as if the Overlook had swallowed them. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shining-the-shining-1/page-11.html","bookId":2574,"book":{"id":2574,"title":"The Shining (The Shining #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Danny was only five years old but in the words of old Mr Halloran he was a \u0027shiner\u0027, aglow with psychic voltage.
