{"id":93520,"no":49,"title":"Page 49","content":"Larry Durkin was a tall and skinny man with a morose face overtopped with a luxuriant mane of red hair. Hallorann had caught him just as he was leaving the Conoco station, the morose face buried deeply inside an army-issue parka. He was reluctant to do any more business that stormy day no matter how far Hallorann had come, and even more reluctant to rent one of his two snowmobiles out to this wild-eyed black man who insisted on going up to the old Overlook. Among people who had spent most of their lives in the little town of Sidewinder, the hotel had a smelly reputation. Murder had been done up there. A bunch of hoods had run the place for a while, and cutthroat businessmen had run it for a while, too. And things had been done up at the old Overlook that never made the papers, because money has a way of talking. But the people in Sidewinder had a pretty good idea. Most of the hotel\u0027s chambermaids came from here, and chambermaids see a lot. But when Hallorann mentioned Howard Cottrell\u0027s name and showed Durkin the tag inside one of the blue mittens, the gas station owner thawed. \"Sent you here, did he?\" Durkin asked, unlocking one of the garage bays and leading Hallorann inside. \"Good to know the old rip\u0027s got some sense left. I thought he was plumb out of it.\" He flicked a switch and a bank of very old and very dirty fluorescents buzzed wearily into life. \"Now what in the tarnal creation would you want up at that place, fella?\" Hallorann\u0027s nerve had begun to crack. The last few miles into Sidewinder had been very bad. Once a gust of wind that must have been tooling along at better than sixty miles an hour had floated the Buick all the way around in a 360�� turn. And there were still miles to travel with God alone knew what at the other end of them. He was terrified for the boy. Now it was almost ten minutes to seven and he had this whole song and dance to go through again. \"Somebody is in trouble up there,\" he said very carefully. \"The son of the caretaker.\" \"Who? Torrance\u0027s boy? Now what kind of trouble could he be in?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Hallorann muttered. He felt sick with the time this was taking. He was speaking with a country man, and he knew that all country men feel a similar need to approach their business obliquely, to smell around its corners and sides before plunging into the middle of dealing. But there was no time, because now he was one scared nigger and if this went on much longer he just might decide to cut and run. \"Look,\" he said. \"Please. I need to go up there and I have to have a snowmobile to get there. I\u0027ll pay your price, but for God\u0027s sake let me get on with my business!\" \"All right,\" Durkin said, unperturbed. \"If Howard sent you, that\u0027s good enough. You take this ArcticCat. I\u0027ll put five gallons of gas in the can. Tank\u0027s full. She\u0027ll get you up and back down, I guess.\" \"Thank you,\" Hallorann said, not quite steadily. \"I\u0027ll take twenty dollars. That includes the ethyl.\" Hallorann fumbled a twenty out of his wallet and handed it over. Durkin tucked it into one of his shirt pockets with hardly a look. \"Guess maybe we better trade jackets, too,\" Durkin said, pulling off his parka. \"That overcoat of yours ain\u0027t gonna be worth nothin tonight. You trade me back when you return the snowsled.\" \"Oh, hey, I couldn\u0027t-\" \"Don\u0027t fuss with me,\" Durkin interrupted, still mildly. \"I ain\u0027t sending you out to freeze. I only got to walk down two blocks and I\u0027m at my own supper table. Give it over.\" Slightly dazed, Hallorann traded his overcoat for Durkin\u0027s fur-lined parka. Overhead the fluorescents buzzed faintly, reminding him of the lights in the Overlook\u0027s kitchen. \"Torrance\u0027s boy,\" Durkin said, and shook his head. \"Good-lookin little tyke, ain\u0027t he? He n his dad was in here a lot before the snow really flew. Drivin the hotel truck, mostly. Looked to me like the two of em was just about as tight as they could get. That\u0027s one little boy that loves his daddy. Hope he\u0027s all right.\" \"So do I.\" Hallorann zipped the parka and tied the hood. \"Lemme help you push that out,\" Durkin said. They rolled the snowmobile across the oil-stained concrete and toward the garage bay. \"You ever drove one of these before?\" \"No. \"Well, there\u0027s nothing to it. The instructions are pasted there on the dashboard, but all there really is, is stop and go. Your throttle\u0027s here, just like a motorcycle throttle. Brake on the other side. Lean with it on the turns. This baby will do seventy on hardpack, but on this powder you\u0027ll get no more than fifty and that\u0027s pushing it.\" Now they were in the service station\u0027s snow-filled front lot, and Durkin had raised his voice to make himself heard over the battering of the wind. \"Stay on the road!\" he shouted at Hallorann\u0027s ear. \"Keep your eye on the guardrail posts and the signs and you\u0027ll be all right, I guess. If you get off the road, you\u0027re going to be dead. Understand?\" Hallorann nodded. \"Wait a minute!\" Durkin told him, and ran back into the garage bay. While he was gone, Hallorann turned the key in the ignition and pumped the throttle a little. The snowmobile coughed into brash, choppy life. Durkin came back with a red and black ski mask. \"Put this on under your hood!\" he shouted. Hallorann dragged it on. It was a tight fit, but it cut the last of the numbing wind off from his cheeks and forehead and chin. Durkin leaned close to make himself heard. \"I guess you must know about things the same way Howie does sometimes,\" he said. \"It don\u0027t matter, except that place has got a bad reputation around here. I\u0027ll give you a rifle if you want it.\" \"I don\u0027t think it would do any good,\" Hallorann shouted back. \"You\u0027re the boss. But if you get that boy, you bring him to Sixteen Peach Lane. The wife\u0027ll have some soup on.\" \"Okay. Thanks for everything.\" \"You watch out!\" Durkin yelled. \"Stay on the road!\" Hallorann nodded and twisted the throttle slowly. The snowmobile purred forward, the headlamp cutting a clean cone of light through the thickly falling snow. He saw Durkin\u0027s upraised hand in the rearview mirror, and raised his own in return. Then he nudged the handlebars to the left and was traveling up Main Street, the snowmobile coursing smoothly through the white light thrown by the streetlamps. The speedometer stood at thirty miles an hour. It was ten past seven. At the Overlook, Wendy and Danny were sleeping and Jack Torrance was discussing matters of life and death with the previous caretaker. Five blocks up Main, the streetlamps ended. For half a mile there were small houses, all buttoned tightly up against the storm, and then only wind-howling darkness... In the black again with no light but the thin spear of the snowmobile\u0027s headlamp, terror closed in on him again, a childlike fear, dismal and disheartening. He had never felt so alone. For several minutes, as the few lights of Sidewinder dwindled away and disappeared in the rearview, the urge to turn around and go back was almost insurmountable. He reflected that for all of Durkin\u0027s concern for Jack Torrance\u0027s boy, he had not offered to take the other snowmobile and come with him. (That place has got a bad reputation around here.) Clenching his teeth, he turned the throttle higher and watched the needle on the speedometer climb past forty and settle at forty-five. He seemed to be going horribly fast and yet he was afraid it wasn\u0027t fast enough. At this speed it would take him almost an hour to get to the Overlook. But at a higher speed he might not get there at all. He kept his eyes glued to the passing guardrails and the dime-sized reflectors mounted on top of each one. Many of them were buried under drifts. Twice he saw curve signs dangerously late and felt the snowmobile riding up the drifts that masked the dropoff before turning back onto where the road was in the summertime. The odometer counted off the miles at a maddeningly slow clip-five, ten, finally fifteen. Even behind the knitted ski mask his face was beginning to stiffen up and his legs were growing numb. (Guess I\u0027d give a hundred bucks for a pair of ski pants.) As each mile turned over, his terror grew-as if the place had a poison atmosphere that thickened as you neared it. Had it ever been like this before? He had never really liked the Overlook, and there had been others who shared his feeling, but it had never been like this. He could feel the voice that had almost wrecked him outside of Sidewinder still trying to get in, to get past his defenses to the soft meat inside. If it had been strong twenty-five miles back, how much stronger would it be now? He couldn\u0027t keep it out entirely. Some of it was slipping through, flooding his brain with sinister subliminal images. More and more he got the image of a badly hurt woman in a bathroom, holding her hands up uselessly to ward off a blow, and he felt more and more that the woman must be- (Jesus, watch out!) The embankment was looming up ahead of him like a freight train. Woolgathering, he had missed a turn sign. He jerked the snowmobile\u0027s steering gear hard right and it swung around, tilting as it did so. From underneath came the harsh grating sound of the snowtread on rock. He thought the snowmobile was going to dump him, and it did totter on the knife-edge of balance before halfdriving, half-skidding back down to the more or less level surface of the snowburied road. Then the dropoff was ahead of him, the headlamp showing an abrupt end to the snowcover and darkness beyond that. He turned the snowmobile the other way, a pulse beating sickly in his throat. (Keep it on the road Dicky old chum.) He forced himself to turn the throttle up another notch. Now the speedometer needle was pegged just below fifty. The wind howled and roared. The headlamp probed the dark. An unknown length of time later, he came around a driftbanked curve and saw a glimmering flash of light ahead. Just a glimpse, and then it was blotted out by a rising fold of land. The glimpse was so brief he was persuading himself it had been wishful thinking when another turn brought it in view again, slightly closer, for another few seconds. There was no question of its reality this time; he had seen it from just this angle too many times before. It was the Overlook. There were lights on the first floor and lobby levels, it looked like. Some of his terror-the part that had to do with driving off the road or wrecking the snowmobile on an unseen curve-melted entirely away. The snowmobile swept surely into the first half of an S curve that he now remembered confidently foot for foot, and that was when the headlamp picked out the (oh dear Jesus god what is it) in the road ahead of him. Limned in stark blacks and whites, Hallorann first thought it was some hideously huge timberwolf that had been driven down from the high country by the storm. Then, as he closed on it, he recognized it and horror closed his throat. Not a wolf but a lion. A hedge lion. Its features were a mask of black shadow and powdered snow, its haunches wound tight to spring. And it did spring, snow billowing around its pistoning rear legs in a silent burst of crystal glitter. Hallorann screamed and twisted the handlebars hard right, ducking low at the same time. Scratching, ripping pain scrawled itself across his face, his neck, his shoulders. The ski mask was torn open down the back. He was hurled from the snowmobile. He hit the snow, plowed through it, rolled over. He could feel it coming for him. In his nostrils there was a bitter smell of green leaves and holly. A huge hedge paw batted him in the small of the back and he flew ten feet through the air, splayed out like a rag doll. He saw the snowmobile, riderless, strike the embankment and rear up, its headlamp searching the sky. It fell over with a thump and stalled. Then the hedge lion was on him. There was a crackling, rustling sound. Something raked across the front of the parka, shredding it. It might have been stiff twigs, but Hallorann knew it was claws. \"You\u0027re not there!\" Hallorann screamed at the circling, snarling hedge lion. \"You\u0027re not there at all!\" He struggled to his feet and made it halfway to the snowmobile before the lion lunged, batting him across the head with a needletipped paw. Hallorann saw silent, exploding lights. \"Not there,\" he said again, but it was a fading mutter. His knees unhinged and dropped him into the snow. He crawled for the snowmobile, the right side of his face a scarf of blood. The lion struck him again, rolling him onto his back like a turtle. It roared playfully. Hallorann struggled to reach the snowmobile. What he needed was there. And then the lion was on him again, ripping and clawing.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shining-the-shining-1/page-49.html","bookId":2574,"book":{"id":2574,"title":"The Shining (The Shining #1)","description":"Storyline: Danny was only five years old but in the words of old Mr Halloran he was a \u0027shiner\u0027, aglow with psychic voltage.
