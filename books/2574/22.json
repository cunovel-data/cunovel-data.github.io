Wendy and Danny were on their way down to Sidewinder. The day was clear and bright. Danny was turning Jack\u0027s orange library card over and over in his hands and seemed cheerful enough, but Wendy thought he looked drawn and tired, as if be hadn\u0027t been sleeping enough and was going on nervous energy alone.\\n\\n The song ended and the disc jockey came on. \"Yeah, that\u0027s Creedence. And speakin of bad moon, it looks like it may be risin over the KMTX listening area before long, hard as it is to believe with the beautiful, springlike weather we\u0027ve enjoyed for the last couple-three days. The KMTX Fearless Forecaster says high pressure will give way by one o\u0027clock this afternoon to a widespread lowpressure area which is just gonna grind to a stop in our KMTX area, up where the air is rare. Temperatures will fall rapidly, and precipitation should start around dusk. Elevations under seven thousand feet, including the metro-Denver area, can expect a mixture of sleet and snow, perhaps freezing on some roads, and nothin but snow up here, cuz. We\u0027re lookin at one to three inches below seven thousand and possible accumulations of six to ten inches in Central Colorado and on the Slope. The Highway Advisory Board says that if you\u0027re plannin to tour the mountains in your car this afternoon or tonight, you should remember that the chain law will be in effect. And don\u0027t go nowhere unless you have to. Remember,\" the announcer added jocularly, \"that\u0027s how the Donners got into trouble. They just weren\u0027t as close to the nearest Seven-Eleven as they thought.\"\\n\\n A Clairol commercial came on, and Wendy reached down and snapped the radio off. \"You mind?\"\\n\\n \"Huh-uh, that\u0027s okay.\" He glanced out at the sky, which was bright blue. \"Guess Daddy picked just the right day to trim those hedge animals, didn\u0027t he?\"\\n\\n \"I guess he did,\" Wendy said.\\n\\n \"Sure doesn\u0027t look much like snow, though,\" Danny added hopefully.\\n\\n \"Getting cold feet?\" Wendy asked. She was still thinking about that crack the disc jockey had made about the Donner Party.\\n\\n \"Nah, I guess not.\"\\n\\n Well, she thought, this is the time. If you\u0027re going to bring it up, do it now or forever hold your peace.\\n\\n \"Danny,\" she said, making her voice as casual as possible, \"would you be happier if we went away from the Overlook? If we didn\u0027t stay the winter?\"\\n\\n Danny looked down at his hands. \"I guess so,\" he said. \"Yeah. But it\u0027s Daddy\u0027s job.\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes,\" she said carefully, \"I get the idea that Daddy might be happier away from the Overlook, too.\" They passed a sign which read SIDEWINDER 18 mi. and then she took the truck cautiously around a hairpin and shifted up into second. She took no chances on these downgrades; they scared her silly.\\n\\n \"Do you really think so?\" Danny asked. He looked at her with interest for a moment and then shook his head. \"No, I don\u0027t think so.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Because he\u0027s worried about us,\" Danny said, choosing his words carefully. It was hard to explain, he understood so little of it himself. He found himself harking back to an incident he had told Mr. Hallorann about, the big kid looking at department store TV sets and wanting to steal one. That had been distressing, but at least it had been clear what was going on, even to Danny, then little more than an infant. But grownups were always in a turmoil, every possible action muddied over by thoughts of the consequences, by self-doubt, by seIfimage, by feelings of love and responsibility. Every possible choice seemed to have drawbacks, and sometimes he didn\u0027t understand why the drawbacks were drawbacks. It was very hard.\\n\\n \"He thinks...\" Danny began again, and then looked at his mother quickly. She was watching the road, not looking at him, and he felt he could go on.\\n\\n \"He thinks maybe we\u0027ll be lonely. And then he thinks that he likes it here and it\u0027s a good place for us. He loves us and doesn\u0027t want us to be lonely... or sad... but he thinks even if we are, it might be okay in the LONGRUN. Do you know LONGRUN?\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"Yes, dear. I do.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s worried that if we left he couldn\u0027t get another job. That we\u0027d have to beg, or something.\"\\n\\n \"Is that all?\"\\n\\n \"No, but the rest is all mixed up. Because he\u0027s different now.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she said, almost sighing. The grade eased a little and she shifted cautiously back to third gear.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not making this up, Mommy. Honest to God.\"\\n\\n \"I know that,\" she said, and smiled. \"Did Tony tell you?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he said. \"I just know. That doctor didn\u0027t believe in Tony, did he?\"\\n\\n \"Never mind that doctor,\" she said. \"I believe in Tony. I don\u0027t know what he is or who he is, if he\u0027s a part of you that\u0027s special or if he comes from... somewhere outside, but I do believe in him, Danny. And if you... he... think we should go, we will. The two of us will go and be together with Daddy again in the spring.\"\\n\\n He looked at her with sharp hope. \"Where? A motel?\"\\n\\n \"Hon, we couldn\u0027t afford a motel. It would have to be at my mother\u0027s.\"\\n\\n The hope in Danny\u0027s face died out. \"I know-\" he said, and stopped.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" he muttered.\\n\\n She shifted back to second as the grade steepened again. \"No, doc, please don\u0027t say that. This talk is something we should have had weeks ago, I think. So please. What is it you know? I won\u0027t be mad. I can\u0027t be mad, because this is too important. Talk straight to me.\"\\n\\n \"I know how you feel about her,\" Danny said, and sighed.\\n\\n \"How do I feel?\"\\n\\n \"Bad,\" Danny said, and then rhyming, singsong, frightening her: \"Bad. Sad. Mad. It\u0027s like she wasn\u0027t your mommy at all. Like she wanted to eat you.\" He looked at her, frightened. \"And I don\u0027t like it there. She\u0027s always thinking about how she would be better for me than you. And how she could get me away from you. Mommy, I don\u0027t want to go there. I\u0027d rather be at the Overlook than there.\"\\n\\n Wendy was shaken. Was it that bad between her and hermother? God, what hell for the boy if it was and he could really read their thoughts for each other. She suddenly felt more naked than naked, as if she had been caught in an obscene act.\\n\\n \"All right,\" she said. \"All right, Danny.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re mad at me,\" he said in a small, near-to-tears voice.\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m not. Really I\u0027m not. I\u0027m just sort of shook up.\" They were passing a SIDEWINDER 15 mi. sign, and Wendy relaxed a little. From here on in the road was better.\\n\\n \"I want to ask you one more question, Danny. I want you to answer it as truthfully as you can. Will you do that?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Mommy,\" he said, almost whispering.\\n\\n \"Has your daddy been drinking again?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he said, and smothered the two words that rose behind his lips after that simple negative: Not yet.\\n\\n Wendy relaxed a little more. She put a hand on Danny\u0027s jeans-clad leg and squeezed it. \"Your daddy has tried very hard,\" she said softly. \"Because he loves us. And we love him, don\u0027t we?\"\\n\\n He nodded gravely.\\n\\n Speaking almost to herself she went on: \"He\u0027s not a perfect man, but he has tried... Danny, he\u0027s tried so hard! When he... stopped... he went through a kind of hell. He\u0027s still going through it. I think if it hadn\u0027t been for us, he would have just let go. I want to do what\u0027s right. And I don\u0027t know. Should we go? Stay? It\u0027s like a choice between the fat and the fire.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"Would you do something for me, doc?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Try to make Tony come. Right now. Ask him if we\u0027re safe at the Overlook.\"\\n\\n \"I already tried,\" Danny said slowly. \"This morning.\"\\n\\n \"What happened?\" Wendy asked. \"What did he say?\"\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t come,\" Danny said. \"Tony didn\u0027t come.\" And he suddenly burst into tears.\\n\\n \"Danny,\" she said, alarmed. \"Honey, don\u0027t do that. Please-\" The truck swerved across the double yellow line and she pulled it back, scared.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t take me to Gramma\u0027s,\" Danny said through his tears. \"Please, Mommy, I don\u0027t want to go there, I want to stay with Daddy-\"\\n\\n \"All right,\" she said softly. \"All right, that\u0027s what we\u0027ll do.\" She took a Kleenex out of the pocket of her Western-style shirt and handed it to him. \"We\u0027ll stay. And everything will be fine. Just fine.\"\\n\\n \"Bad Moon Rising,\" by J. C. Fogerty, (c) 1969 Jondora Music, Berkeley, California. Used by permission. All rights reserved.
