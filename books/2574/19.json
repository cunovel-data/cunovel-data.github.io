{"id":93490,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"Danny was remembering the words of someone else who had worked at the Overlook during the season: Her saying she\u0027d seen something in one of the rooms where... a bad thing happened. That was in Room 217 and I want you to promise me you won\u0027t go in there, Danny... steer right clear... It was a perfectly ordinary door, no different from any other door on the first two floors of the hotel. It was dark gray, halfway down a corridor that ran at right angles to the main second-floor hallway. The numbers on the door looked no different from the house numbers on the Boulder apartment building they had lived in. A 2, a 1, and a 7. Big deal. Just below them was a tiny glass circle, a peephole. Danny had tried several of them. From the inside you got a wide, fish-eye view of the corridor. From outside you could screw up your eye seven ways to Sunday and still not see a thing. A dirty gyp: (Why are you here?) After the walk behind the Overlook, he and Mommy had come back and she had fixed him his favorite lunch, a cheese and bologna sandwich plus Campbell\u0027s Bean Soup. They ate in Dick\u0027s kitchen and talked. The radio was on, getting thin and crackly music from the Estes Park station. The kitchen was his favorite place in the hotel, and he guessed that Mommy and Daddy must feel the same way, because after trying their meals in the dining room for three days or so, they had begun eating in the kitchen by mutual consent, setting up chairs around Dick Hallorann\u0027s butcher block, which was almost as big as their dining room table back in Stovington, anyway. The dining room had been too depressing, even with the lights on and the music playing from the tape cassette system in the ofce. You were still just one of three people sitting at a table surrounded by dozens of other tables, all empty, all covered with those transparent plastic dustcloths. Mommy said it was like having dinner in the middle of a Horace Walpole novel, and Daddy had laughed and agreed. Danny had no idea who Horace Walpole was, but he did know that Mommy\u0027s cooking had begun to taste better as soon as they began to eat it in the kitchen. He kept discovering little flashes of Dick Hallorann\u0027s personality lying around, and they reassured him like a warm touch. Mommy bad eaten half a sandwich, no soup. She said Daddy must have gone out for a walk of his own since both the VW and the hotel truck were in the parking lot. She said she was tired and might lie down for an hour or so, if he thought he could amuse himself and not get into trouble. Danny told her around a mouthful of cheese and bologna that he thought he could. \"Why don\u0027t you go out into the playground?\" she asked him. \"I thought you\u0027d love that place, with a sandbox for your trucks and all.\" He swallowed and the food went down his throat in a lump that was dry and hard. \"Maybe I will,\" he said, turning to the radio and fiddling with it. \"And all those neat hedge animals,\" she said, taking his empty plate. \"Your father\u0027s got to get out and trim them pretty soon.\" \"Yeah,\" he said. (Just nasty things... once it had to do with those damn hedges clipped to look like animals...) \"If you see your father before I do, tell him I\u0027m lying down.\" \"Sure, Mom.\" She put the dirty dishes in the sink and came back over to him. \"Are you happy here, Danny?\" He looked at her guilelessly, a milk mustache on his lip. \"Uh-huh.\" \"No more bad dreams?\" \"No.\" Tony had come to him once, one night while he was lying in bed, calling his name faintly and from far away. Danny had squeezed his eyes tightly shut until Tony had gone. \"You sure?\" \"Yes, Mom.\" She seemed satisfied. \"How\u0027s your hand?\" He flexed it for her. \"All better.\" She nodded. Jack had taken the nest under the Pyrex bowl, full of frozen wasps, out to the incinerator in back of the equipment shed and burned it. They had seen no more wasps since. He had written to a lawyer in Boulder, enclosing the snaps of Danny\u0027s hand, and the lawyer had called back two days ago-that had put Jack in a foul temper all afternoon. The lawyer doubted if the company that had manufactured the bug bomb could be sued successfully because there was only Jack to testify that he had followed directions printed on the package. Jack had asked the lawyer if they couldn\u0027t purchase some others and test them for the same defect. Yes, the lawyer said, but the results were highly doubtful even if all the test bombs malfunctioned. He told Jack of a case that involved an extension ladder company and a man who had broken his back. Wendy had commiserated with Jack, but privately she had just been glad that Danny had gotten off as cheaply as he had. It was best to leave lawsuits to people who understood them, and that did not include the Torrances. And they had seen no more wasps since. \"Go and play, doc. Have fun.\" But he hadn\u0027t had fun. He had wandered aimlessly around the hotel, poking into the maids\u0027 closets and the janitor\u0027s rooms, looking for something interesting, not finding it, a small boy padding along a dark blue carpet woven with twisting black lines. He had tried a room door from time to time, but of course they were all locked. The passkey was hanging down in the office, he knew where, but Daddy had told him he shouldn\u0027t touch that. And he didn\u0027t want to. Did be? (Why are you here?) There was nothing aimless about it after all. He had been drawn to Room 217 by a morbid kind of curiosity. He remembered a story Daddy had read to him once when he was drunk. That had been a long time ago, but the story was just as vivid now as when Daddy had read it to him. Mommy had scolded Daddy and asked what he was doing, reading a three-year-old baby something so horrible. The name of the story was Bluebeard. That was clear in his mind too, because he had thought at first Daddy was saying Bluebird, and there were no bluebirds in the story, or birds of any kind for that matter. Actually the story was about Bluebeard\u0027s wife, a pretty lady that had corn-colored hair like Mommy. After Bluebeard married her, they lived in a big and ominous castle that was not unlike the Overlook. And every day Bluebeard went off to work and every day he would tell his pretty little wife not to look in a certain room, although the key to that room was hanging right on a hook, just like the passkey was hanging on the office wall downstairs. Bluebeard\u0027s wife had gotten more and more curious about the locked room. She tried to peep through the keyhole the way Danny had tried to look through Room 217\u0027s peephole with similar unsatisfying results. There was even a picture of her getting down on her knees and trying to look under the door, but the crack wasn\u0027t wide enough. The door swung wide and... The old fairy tale book had depicted her discovery in ghastly, loving detail. The image was burned on Danny\u0027s mind. The severed heads of Bluebeard\u0027s seven previous wives were in the room, each one on its own pedestal, the eyes turned up to whites, the mouths unhinged and gaping in silent screams. They were somehow balanced on necks ragged from the broadsword\u0027s decapitating swing, and there was blood running down the pedestals. Terrified, she had turned to flee from the room and the castle, only to discover Bluebeard standing in the doorway, his terrible eyes blazing. \"I told you not to enter this room,\" Bluebeard said, unsheathing his sword. \"Alas, in your curiosity you are like the other seven, and though I loved you best of all your ending shall be as was theirs. Prepare to die, wretched woman!\" It seemed vaguely to Danny that the story had bad a happy ending, but that had paled to insignificance beside the two dominant images: the taunting, maddening locked door with some great secret behind it, and the grisly secret itself, repeated more than half a dozen times. The locked door and behind it the heads, the severed beads. His hand reached out and stroked the room\u0027s doorknob, almost furtively. He had no idea how long be had been here, standing hypnotized before the bland gray locked door. (And maybe three times I\u0027ve thought I\u0027ve seen things... nasty things...) But Mr. Hallorann-Dick-had also said he didn\u0027t think those things could hurt you. They were like scary pictures in a book, that was all. And maybe he wouldn\u0027t see anything. On the other hand... He plunged his left hand into his pocket and it came out holding the passkey. It had been there all along, of course. He held it by the square metal tab on the end which had OFFICE printed on it in Magic Marker. He twirled the key on its chain, watching it go around and around. After several minutes of this he stopped and slipped the passkey into the lock. It slid in smoothly, with no hitch, as if it had wanted to be there all along. (I\u0027ve thought I\u0027ve seen things... nasty things... promise me you won\u0027t go in there.) (I promise.) And a promise was, of course, very important. Still, his curiosity itched at him as maddeningly as poison ivy in a place you aren\u0027t supposed to scratch. But it was a dreadful kind of curiosity, the kind that makes you peek through your fingers during the scariest parts of a scary movie. What was beyond that door would be no movie. (I don\u0027t think those things can hurt you... like scary pictures in a book...) Suddenly he reached out with his left hand, not sure of what it was going to do until it had removed the passkey and stuffed it back into his pocket. He stared at the door a moment longer, blue-gray eyes wide, then turned quickly and walked back down the corridor toward the main hallway that ran at right angles to the corridor he was in. Something made him pause there and he wasn\u0027t sure what for a moment. Then he remembered that directly around this corner, on the way back to the stairs, there was one of those old-fashioned fire extinguishers curled up against the wall. Curled there like a dozing snake. They weren\u0027t chemical-type extinguishers at all, Daddy said, although there were several of those in the kitchen. These were the forerunner of the modern sprinkler systems. The long canvas hoses hooked directly into the Overlook\u0027s plumbing system, and by turning a single valve you could become a one-man fire department. Daddy said that the chemical extinguishers, which sprayed foam or CO, were much better. The chemicals smothered fires, took away the oxygen they needed to burn, while a high-pressure spray might just spread the flames around. Daddy said that Mr. Ullman should replace the old-fashioned hoses right along with the old-fashioned boiler, but Mr. Ullman would probably do neither because he was a CHEAP PRICK. Danny knew that this was one of the worst epithets his father could summon. It was applied to certain doctors, dentists, and appliance repairmen, and also to the head of his English Department at Stovington, who had disallowed some of Daddy\u0027s book orders because he said the books would put them over budget. \"Over budget, hell,\" he had fumed to Wendy-Danny had been listening from his bedroom where he was supposed to be asleep. \"He\u0027s just saving the last five hundred bucks for himself, the CHEAP PRICK.\" Danny looked around the corner. The extinguisher was there, a fiat hose folded back a dozen times on itself, the red tank attached to the wall. Above it was an ax in a glass case like a museum exhibit, with white words printed on a red background: IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, BREAK GLASS. Danny could read the word EMERGENCY, which was also the name of one of his favorite TV shows, but was unsure of the rest. But he didn\u0027t like the way the word was used in connection with that long fiat hose. EMERGENCY was\u0027, fire, explosions, car crashes, hospitals, sometimes death. And he didn\u0027t like the way that hose hung so blandly on the wall. When he was alone, he always skittered past these extinguishers as fast as he could. No particular reason. It just felt better to go fast. It felt safer. Now, heart thumping loudly in his chest, he came around the corner and looked down the hall past the extinguisher to the stairs. Mommy was down there, sleeping. And if Daddy was back from his walk, he would probably be sitting in the kitchen, eating a sandwich and reading a book. He would just walk right past that old extinguisher and go downstairs. He started toward it, moving closer to the far wall until his right arm was brushing the expensive silk paper. Twenty steps away. Fifteen. A dozen. When he was ten steps away, the brass nozzle suddenly rolled off the fat loop it had been lying on and fell to the hall carpet with a dull thump. It lay there, the dark bore of its muzzle pointing at Danny. He stopped immediately, his shoulders twitching forward with the suddenness of his scare. His blood thumped thickly in his ears and temples. His mouth had gone dry and sour, his hands curled into fists. Yet the nozzle of the hose only lay there, its brass casing glowing mellowly, a loop of flat canvas leading back up to the red-painted frame bolted to the wall. So it had fallen off, so what? It was only a fire extinguisher, nothing else. It was stupid to think that it looked like some poison snake from \"Wide World of Animals\" that had heard him and woken up. Even if the stitched canvas did look a little bit like scales. He would just step over it and go down the hall to the stairs, walking a little bit fast, maybe, to make sure it didn\u0027t snap out after him and curl around his foot... He wiped his lips with his left hand, in unconscious imitation of his father, and took a step forward. No movement from the hose. Another step. Nothing. There, see how stupid you are? You got all worked up thinking about that dumb room and that dumb Bluebeard story and that hose was probably ready to fall off for the last five years. That\u0027s all. Danny stared at the hose on the floor and thought of wasps. Eight steps away, the nozzle of the hose gleamed peacefully at him from the rug as if to say: Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m just a hose, that\u0027s all. And even if that isn\u0027t all, what I do to you won\u0027t be much worse than a bee sting. Or a wasp sting. What would I want to do to a nice little boy like you... except bite... and bite... and bite? Danny took another step, and another. His breath was dry and harsh in his throat. Panic was close now. He began to wish the hose would move, then at last be would know, he would be sure. He took another step and now he was within striking distance. But it\u0027s not going to strike at you, he thought hysterically. How can it strike at you, bite at you, when it\u0027s just a hose? Maybe it\u0027s full of wasps. His internal temperature plummeted to ten below zero. He stared at the black bore in the center of the nozzle, nearly hypnotized. Maybe it was full of wasps, secret wasps, their brown bodies bloated with poison, so full of autumn poison that it dripped from their stingers in clear drops of fluid. Suddenly he knew that he was nearly frozen with terror; if he did not make his feet go now, they would become locked to the carpet and he would stay here, staring at the black hole in the center of the brass nozzle like a bird staring at a snake, he would stay here until his daddy found him and then what would happen? With a high moan, he made himself run. As he reached the hose, some trick of the light made the nozzle seem to move, to revolve as if to strike, and he leaped high in the air above it; in his panicky state it seemed that his legs pushed him nearly all the way to the ceiling, that he could feel the stiff back hairs that formed his cowlick brushing the hallway\u0027s plaster ceiling, although later he knew that couldn\u0027t have been so. He came down on the other side of the hose and ran, and suddenly he heard it behind him, coming for him, the soft dry whicker of that brass snake\u0027s head as it slithered rapidly along the carpet after him like a rattlesnake moving swiftly through a dry field of grass. It was coming for him, and suddenly the stairs seemed very far away; they seemed to retreat a running step into the distance for each running step he took toward them. Daddy! he tried to scream, but his closed throat would not allow a word to pass. He was on his own. Behind him the sound grew louder, the dry sliding sound of the snake, slipping swiftly over the carpet\u0027s dry hackles. At his heels now, perhaps rising up with the clear poison dribbling from its brass snout. Danny reached the stairs and had to pinwheel his arms crazily for balance. For one moment it seemed sure that he would cartwheel over and go head-for-heels to the bottom. He threw a glance back over his shoulder. The hose had not moved. It lay as it had lain, one loop off the frame, the brass nozzle on the hall floor, the nozzle pointing disinterestedly away from him. You see, stupid? he berated himself. You made it all up, scaredy-cat. It was all your imagination, scaredy-cat, scaredy-cat. He clung to the stairway railing, his legs trembling in reaction. (It never chased you) his mind told him, and seized on that thought, and played it back. (never chased you, never chased you, never did, never did) It was nothing to be afraid of. Why, he could go back and put that hose right into its frame, if he wanted to. He could, but he didn\u0027t think he would. Because what if it had chased him and had gone back when it saw that it couldn\u0027t... quite... catch him? The hose lay on the carpet, almost seeming to ask him if he would like to come back and try again. Panting, Danny ran downstairs.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shining-the-shining-1/page-19.html","bookId":2574,"book":{"id":2574,"title":"The Shining (The Shining #1)","description":"Storyline: Danny was only five years old but in the words of old Mr Halloran he was a \u0027shiner\u0027, aglow with psychic voltage.
