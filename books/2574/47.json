{"id":93518,"no":47,"title":"Page 47","content":"It was quarter of two in the afternoon and according to the snow-clotted signs and the Hertz Buick\u0027s odometer, he was less than three miles from Estes Park when he finally went off the road.\n In the hills, the snow was falling faster and more furiously than Hallorann had ever seen (which was, perhaps, not to say a great deal, since Hallorann had seen as little snow as he could manage in his lifetime), and the wind was blowing a capricious gale-now from the west, now backing around to the north, sending clouds of powdery snow across his field of vision, making him coldly aware again and again that if he missed a turn he might well plunge two hundred feet off the road, the Electra cartwheeling ass over teapot as it went down. Making it worse was his own amateur status as a winter driver. It scared him to have the yellow center line buried under swirling, drifting snow, and it scared him when the heavy gusts of wind came unimpeded through the notches in the hills and actually made the heavy Buick slew around. It scared him that the road information signs were mostly masked with snow and you could flip a coin as to whether the road was going to break right or left up ahead in the white drive-in movie screen he seemed to be driving through. He was scared, all right. He had driven in a cold sweat since climbing into the hills west of Boulder and Lyons, handling the accelerator and brake as if they were Ming vases. Between rock \u0027n\u0027 roll tunes on the radio, the disc jockey constantly adjured motorists to stay off the main highways and under no conditions to go into the mountains, because many roads were impassable and all of them were dangerous. Scores of minor accidents had been reported, and two serious ones: a party of skiers in a VW microbus and a family that had been bound for Albuquerque through the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The combined score on both was four dead and five wounded. \"So stay off those roads and get into the good music here at KTLK,\" the jock concluded cheerily, and then compounded Hallorann\u0027s misery by playing \"Seasons in the Sun.\" \"We had joy, we had fun, we had-\" Terry Jacks gibbered happily, and Hallorann snapped the radio off viciously, knowing he would have it back on in five minutes. No matter how bad it was, it was better than riding alone through this white madness.\n (Admit it. Dis heap black boy has got at least one long stripe of yaller... and it runs rant up his ebberlubbin back!)\n It wasn\u0027t even funny. He would have backed off before he even cleared Boulder if it hadn\u0027t been for his compulsion that the boy was in terrible trouble. Even now a small voice in the back of his skull-more the voice of reason than of cowardice, he thought-was telling him to hole up in an Estes Park motel for the night and wait for the plows to at least expose the center stripe again. That voice kept reminding him of the jet\u0027s shaky landing at Stapleton, of that sinking feeling that it was going to come in nose-first, delivering its passengers to the gates of hell rather than at Gate 39, Concourse B. But reason would not stand against the compulsion. It had to be today. The snowstorm was his own bad luck. He would have to cope with it. He was afraid that if he didn\u0027t, he might have something much worse to cope with in his dreams.\n The wind gusted again, this time from the northeast, a little English on the ball if you please, and he was again cut off from the vague shapes of the hills and even from the embankments on either side of the road. He was driving through white null.\n And then the high sodium lights of the snowplow loomed out of the soup, bearing down, and to his horror he saw that instead of being to one side, the Buick\u0027s nose was pointed directly between those headlamps. The plow was being none too choosy about keeping its own side of the road, and Hallorann had allowed the Buick to drift.\n The grinding roar of the plow\u0027s diesel engine intruded over the bellow of the wind, and then the sound of its airhorn, hard, long, almost deafening.\n Hallorann\u0027s testicles turned into two small wrinkled sacs filled with shaved ice. His guts seemed to have been transformed into a large mass of Silly Putty.\n Color was materializing out of the white now, snow-clotted orange. He could see the high cab, even the gesticulating figure of the driver behind the single long wiper blade. He could see the V shape of the plow\u0027s wing blades, spewing more snow up onto the road\u0027s left-hand embankment like pallid, smoking exhaust.\n WHAAAAAAAAA! the airhorn bellowed indignantly.\n He squeezed the accelerator like the breast of a muchloved woman and the Buick scooted forward and toward the right. There was no embankment over here; the plows headed up instead of down had only to push the snow directly over the drop.\n (The drop, ah yes, the drop-)\n The wingblades on Hallorann\u0027s left, fully four feet higher than the Electra\u0027s roof, flirted by with no more than an inch or two to spare. Until the plow had actually cleared him, Hallorann had thought a crash inevitable. A prayer which was half an inarticulate apology to the boy flitted through his mind like a torn rag.\n Then the plow was past, its revolving blue lights glinting and flashing in Hallorann\u0027s rearview mirror.\n He jockeyed the Buick\u0027s steering wheel back to the left, but nothing doing. The scoot had turned into a skid, and the Buick was floating dreamily toward the lip of the drop, spurning snow from under its mudguards.\n He flicked the wheel back the other way, in the skid\u0027s direction, and the car\u0027s front and rear began to swap places. Panicked now, he pumped the brake hard, and then felt a hard bump. In front of him the road was gone... he was looking into a bottomless chasm of swirling snow and vague greenish-gray pines far away and far below.\n (I\u0027m going holy mother of Jesus I\u0027m going off)\n And that was where the car stopped, canting forward at a thirty-degree angle, the left fender jammed against a guardrail, the rear wheels nearly off the ground. When Hallorann tried reverse, the wheels only spun helplessly. His heart was doing a Gene Krupa drumroll.\n He got out-very carefully he got out-and went around to the Buick\u0027s back deck.\n He was standing there, looking at the back wheels helplessly, when a cheerful voice behind him said: \"Hello there. fella. You must be shit right out of your mind.\"\n He turned around and saw the plow forty yards further down the road, obscured in the blowing snow except for the raftered dark brown streak of its exhaust and the revolving blue lights on top. The driver was standing just behind him, dressed in a long sheepskin coat and a slicker over it. A blue-and-white pinstriped engineer\u0027s cap was perched on his head, and Hallorann could hardly believe it was staying on in the teeth of the wind.\n (Glue. It sure-God must be glue.)\n \"Hi,\" he said. \"Can you pull me back onto the road?\"\n \"Oh, I guess I could,\" the plow driver said. \"What the hell you doing way up here, mister? Good way to kill your ass.\"\n \"Urgent business.\"\n \"Nothin is that urgent,\" the plow driver said slowly and kindly, as if speaking to a mental defective. \"If you\u0027d \u0027a hit that post a leetle mite harder, nobody woulda got you out till All Fools\u0027 Day. Don\u0027t come from these parts, do you?\"\n \"No. And I wouldn\u0027t be here unless my business was as urgent as I say.\"\n \"That so?\" The driver shifted his stance companionably as if they were having a desultory chat on the back steps instead of standing in a blizzard halfway between hoot and holler, with Hallorann\u0027s car balanced three hundred feet above the tops of the trees below.\n \"Where you headed? Estes?\"\n \"No, a place called the Overlook Hotel,\" Hallorann said. \"It\u0027s a little way above Sidewinder-\"\n But the driver was shaking his head dolefully.\n \"I guess I know well enough where that is,\" he said. \"Mister, you\u0027ll never get up to the old Overlook. Roads between Estes Park and Sidewinder is bloody damn hell. It\u0027s driftin in right behind us no matter how hard we push. I come through drifts a few miles back that was damn near six feet through the middle. And even if you could make Sidewinder, why, the road\u0027s closed from there all the way across to Buckland, Utah. Nope.\" He shook his head. \"Never make it, mister. Never make it at all.\"\n \"I have to try,\" Hallorann said, calling on his last reserves of patience to keep his voice normal. \"There\u0027s a boy up there-\"\n \"Boy? Naw. The Overlook closes down at the last end of September. No percentage keepin it open longer. Too many shit-storms like this.\"\n \"He\u0027s the son of the caretaker. He\u0027s in trouble.\"\n \"How would you know that?\"\n His patience snapped.\n \"For Christ\u0027s sake are you going to stand there and flap y\u0027jaw at me the rest of the day? I know, I know! Now are you going to pull me back on the road or not?\"\n \"Kind of testy, aren\u0027t you?\" the driver observed, not particularly perturbed. \"Sure, get back in there. I got a chain behind the seat.\"\n Hallorann got back behind the wheel, beginning to shake with delayed reaction now. His hands were numbed almost clear through. He had forgotten to bring gloves.\n The plow backed up to the rear of the Buick, and he saw the driver get out with a long coil of chain. Hallorann opened the door and shouted: \"What can I do to help?\"\n \"Stay out of the way, is all,\" the driver shouted back. \"This ain\u0027t gonna take a blink,\"\n Which was true. A shudder ran through the Buick\u0027s frame as the chain pulled tight, and a second later it was back on the road, pointed more or less toward Estes Park. The plow driver walked up beside the window and knocked on the safety glass. Hallorann rolled down the window.\n \"Thanks,\" he said. \"I\u0027m sorry I shouted at you.\"\n \"I been shouted at before,\" the driver said with a grin. \"I guess you\u0027re sorta strung up. You take these.\" A pair of bulky blue mittens dropped into Hallorann\u0027s lap. \"You\u0027ll need em when you go off the road again, I guess. Cold out. You wear em unless you want to spend the rest of your life pickin your nose with a crochetin hook. And you send em back. My wife knitted em and I\u0027m partial to em. Name and address is sewed right into the linin. I\u0027m Howard Cottrell, by the way. You just send em back when you don\u0027t need em anymore. And I don\u0027t want to have to go payin no postage due, mind.\"\n \"All right,\" Hallorann said. \"Thanks. One hell of a lot.\"\n \"You be careful. I\u0027d take you myself, but I\u0027m busy as a cat in a mess of guitar strings.\"\n \"That\u0027s okay. Thanks again.\"\n He started to roll up the window, but Cottrell stopped him.\n \"When you get to Sidewinder-if you get to Sidewinder-you go to Durkin\u0027s Conoco. It\u0027s right next to the li\u0027brey. Can\u0027t miss it. You ask for Larry Durkin. Tell him Howie Cottrell sent you and you want to rent one of his snowmobiles. You mention my name and show those mittens, you\u0027ll get the cut rate.\"\n \"Thanks again,\" Hallorann said.\n Cottrell nodded. \"It\u0027s funny. Ain\u0027t no way you could know someone\u0027s in trouble up there at the Overlook... the phone\u0027s out, sure as hell. But I believe you. Sometimes I get feelins.\"\n Hallorann nodded. \"Sometimes I do, too.\"\n \"Yeah. I know you do. But you take care.\"\n \"I will.\"\n Cottrell disappeared into the blowing dimness with a final wave, his engineer cap still mounted perkily on his head. Hallorann got going again, the chains flailing at the snowcover on the road, finally digging in enough to start the Buick moving. Behind him, Howard Cottrell gave a final good-luck blast on his plow\u0027s airhorn, although it was really unnecessary; Hallorann could feel him wishing him good luck.\n That\u0027s two shines in one day, he thought, and that ought to be some kind of good omen. But he distrusted omens, good or bad. And meeting two people with the shine in one day (when he usually didn\u0027t run across more than four or five in the course of a year) might not mean anything. That feeling of finality, a feeling\n (like things are all wrapped up)\n he could not completely define was still very much with him. It was\n The Buick wanted to skid sideways around a tight curve and Hallorann jockeyed it carefully, hardly daring to breathe. He turned on the radio again and it was Aretha, and Aretha was just fine. He\u0027d share his Hertz Buick with her any day.\n Another gust of wind struck the car, making it rock and slip around. Hallorann cursed it and hunched more closely over the wheel. Aretha finished her song and then the jock was on again, telling him that driving today was a good way to get killed.\n Hallorann snapped the radio off.\n He did make it to Sidewinder, although he was four and a half hours on the road between Estes Park and there. By the time he got to the Upland Highway it was full dark, but the snowstorm showed no sign of abating. Twice he\u0027d had to stop in front of drifts that were as high as his car\u0027s hood and wait for the plows to come along and knock holes in them. At one of the drifts the plow had come up on his side of the road and there had been another close call. The driver had merely swung around his car, not getting out to chew the fat, but he did deliver one of the two finger gestures that all Americans above the age of ten recognize, and it was not the peace sign.\n It seemed that as he drew closer to the Overlook, his need to hurry became more and more compulsive. He found himself glancing at his wristwatch almost constantly. The hands seemed to be flying along.\n Ten minutes after he had turned onto the Upland, he passed two signs. The whooping wind had cleared both of their snow pack so he was able to read them. SIDEWINDER 10, the first said. The second: ROAD CLOSED 12 MILES AHEAD DURING WINTER MONTHS.\n \"Larry Durkin,\" Hallorann muttered to himself. His dark face was strained and tense in the muted green glow of the dashboard instruments. It was ten after six. \"The Conoco by the library. Larry-\"\n And that was when it struck him full-force, the smell of oranges and the thought-force, heavy and hateful, murderous:\n (GET OUT OF HERE YOU DIRTY NIGGER THIS IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS YOU NIGGER TURN AROUND TURN AROUND OR WE\u0027LL KILL YOU HANG YOU UP FROM A TREE LIMB YOU FUCKING JUNGLE-BUNNY COON AND THEN BURN THE BODY THAT\u0027S WHAT WE DO WITH NIGGERS SO TURN AROUND NOW)\n Hallorann screamed in the close confines of the car. The message did not come to him in words but in a series of rebuslike images that were slammed into his head with terrific force. He took his hands from the steering wheel to blot the pictures out.\n Then the car smashed broadside into one of the embankments, rebounded, slewed halfway around, and came to a stop. The rear wheels spun uselessly.\n Hallorann snapped the gearshift into park, and then covered his face with his hands. He did not precisely cry; what escaped him was an uneven huh-huh-huh sound. His chest heaved. He knew that if that blast had taken him on a stretch of road with a dropoff on one side or the other, he might well be dead now. Maybe that had been the idea. And it might hit him again, at any time. He would have to protect against it. He was surrounded by a red force of immense power that might have been memory. He was drowning in instinct.\n He took his hands away from his face and opened his eyes cautiously. Nothing. If there was something trying to scare him again, it wasn\u0027t getting through. He was closed off.\n Had that happened to the boy? Dear God, had that happened to the little boy?\n And of all the images, the one that bothered him the roost was that dull whacking sound, like a hammer splatting into thick cheese. What did that mean?.\n (Jesus, not that little boy. Jesus, please.)\n He dropped the gearshift lever into low range and fed the engine gas a little at a time. The wheels spun, caught, spun, and caught again. The Buick began to move, its headlights cutting weakly through the swirling snow. He looked at his watch. Almost six-thirty now. And he was beginning to feel that was very late indeed. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shining-the-shining-1/page-47.html","bookId":2574,"book":{"id":2574,"title":"The Shining (The Shining #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Danny was only five years old but in the words of old Mr Halloran he was a \u0027shiner\u0027, aglow with psychic voltage.
