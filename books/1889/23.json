Her twentieth birthday is the date she has chosen. Almost seventeen years since she has seen them.\"\n I shake my head, \"Okay, great. That’s the final step.\"\n I can hear Jane smile when she speaks, \"You working? You sound different.\"\n I realize I\u0027m rubbing the front of my pants and stop myself, \"Yes.\" I\u0027ve gotten hard all day like I was a teenaged boy again. Of course, when I was a teenager, I didn’t have that problem much.\n Pacing the apartment has become something of an Olympic sport for me.\n I send her another ‘hi’ text message. She is reading but not responding. It\u0027s like the worst game of cat and mouse. I know she wants to see me. She has to. That sex was like a drug and I need it again. I walk down the hallway to get a shower and see the ornate door. It stops me cold in my tracks.\n It\u0027s exactly the sort of thing a girl like her doesn’t do.\n Or does she?\n I open the door to the bathroom, ignoring the ornate-metal door.\n The shower doesn’t take anything away.\n I change and go back to pacing, ignoring the door to the room, and the images of paddling her.\n Finally Stuart phones, \"Dude, she’s out with that guy. I just followed them to some restaurant. Impromptu date.\"\n The whole world crashes down.\n \"Eli?\"\n I swallow but I can\u0027t speak.\n \"Eli? What did you do?\"\n \"Stu, I need her. Stay there. I need her to come to me.\" My words are broken a little.\n \"Oh man. You didn’t have sex with her, did you?\"\n I lick my lips, it\u0027s involuntary. I hate that. I shake my head, \"Just bring her here.\"\n I hang up and text her the truth but her truth is already there. She finally sent me back a message, \u0027I need you.\u0027\n I take a deep breath and feel my heart start beating again. I send her the way I feel, \u0027I need you too.\u0027\n I need her more than ever but she deserves to see the truth. If she is dating him, she stands a chance at her perfect normal.\n I\u0027ve just finished getting everything ready when I see Stuart pull up in front of the building and walk to the elevator. I hate the damned thing just a little less, now that it has such an amazing memory attached to it. I step inside and wait for her to push the button.\n My heart breaks when it starts moving to the lobby. I can barely swallow when the door dings.\n She looks startled to see me. I put a hand out for her. She takes it but we don’t speak. I have nothing to say. My heart will try to do the talking and then everything will be an even bigger mess. When the elevator stops at ten, I drag her into the house, stomping the whole way to the ornate door and fling her inside.\n The room is warm from the crackling fireplace that I lit. I always do. I love the room and hate it a little. The four-post bed is quite the piece. The canopy rails are my favorite. The bed is king sized but the posts and rails make it that much larger.\n I flick at her chin and nod at the blindfold hanging off of the post. It\u0027s new but she doesn’t know that. I\u0027m waiting for her to run but she doesn’t move. Frozen with fear maybe?\n \"You need to see this. You need to know. This is what I need you for.\" I don’t know if regular sex like in the elevator will ever be enough. I need to face the reality that I have never been regular. This is my normal.\n I close the door when she doesn’t move, hoping to scare her off by making her feel trapped and run from the room screaming.\n She looks at me like I am a monster but says something so opposite, \"You don’t scare me.\"\n I point at the bed, \"You texted me, Sarah. You needed me. This is me. This is what I have to offer. I don’t have anything else to give you.\"\n Her hands shake but they reach for the zipper on her coat.\n Oh shit.\n She holds my gaze hostage and lets her coat drop to the floor. She looked excited. It makes me excited. I bite my lips to stop from begging her to let me lick every inch of her and step back. The chair in the corner is my watching chair. I sit and smile, \"Undress.\"\n She takes a long inhale, contemplating it and then starts. Her shirt is gone first, making my pants uncomfortably tight. Her smooth, white supple breasts are in that odd-looking bra that isn’t a bra. I have never heard a noise as exciting as the sound of her zipper. She wiggles out of the pants and stands there mostly naked.\n The fire crackles, reminding me I have to be the one to talk. I nod at the bed, \"Go to the bed.\"\n She doesn’t get a chance to move much beyond touching the bed and I\u0027m out of the chair. I press myself into her ass and wrap myself around her. Her silky skin under my hands makes them sweat. I want to do a thousand things to her and I know I\u0027ll last about five minutes. The smell of her is intoxicating. I lift her hands to the railing and nuzzle into her neck more, licking and kissing. \"Don’t move those hands,\" She can barely touch the floor with her hands so high. Her body is tight and lean. I kiss and nibble at her neck and back. Her runner\u0027s ass sticks out, taunting me. I pull it back, moving it over the rigid bump of my cock in my pants. Her hands wobble, making me smile but I use my dom voice, \"Don\u0027t let go of that railing, Sarah.\"\n I touch her, savor her and then realize I forgot the blindfold. She has me in knots.\n I tie it over her sexy eyes, making those lips seem like they stick out more. I sit on the bed in front of her and just look. She is so beautiful.\n The weird bra thing is like a band across her breasts. It\u0027s not flattering, but I can see the outline of her nipples. I thumb one through the fabric. Her lips part and mine lift into a smile. If she could see the look on my face she\u0027d laugh. I reach up and play with the other one. I knew a girl once who could orgasm with nipple play. It was fascinating but it taught me that even if girls can\u0027t orgasm, they can get quite excited.\n I flick and squeeze and lightly drag my fingers back and forth until her nipples are so erect, I need them in my mouth. I flip the weird band thing off and there is the most perfect nipple. Seeing her naked before was different. I tried not to see. Now, I want to notice every detail of her perfect pink nipples. I take one in my mouth and, instantly, I notice the way she squeezes her thighs together. I lick and suck and swirl my tongue around one while still rubbing the other. Her thighs clench harder. She wobbles and I swear she\u0027s going to cum. I mutter, \"Are you going to cum for me, Sarah? Before I even touch your pussy?\"\n She moans louder. She likes it when I talk to her.\n \"Come for me, baby.\" I suck harder and she does. She orgasms and loses her grip. My body reacts like it would if she were just a regular girl. I jump up and shove her face down into the blankets. She\u0027s still moaning and gripping the bedding.\n I\u0027m breathless and confused by her effects on me, but I stay in character, \"I told you to keep your hands there.\" Her ass sticking out like that is sending me over the edge.\n I back away, and the next moments are more like a movie playing out in front of me, than real life. I turn to the wall and pull a paddle I\u0027ve never tried before. It\u0027s metal and wide. It feels like it weighs a ton in my hand, and like a zombie I walk to her, rubbing her ass and warming her up. She\u0027s writhing and ready for it. I place the cold metal against her ass. She jumps and then sticks herself out more. She doesn’t shy away from the paddle.\n My words are breathy and cold, \"If you struggle, I will hit you harder.\" I don’t want to do what I am about to, but I can\u0027t stop the movie from playing out. The side of me I never wanted her to see is there and he can\u0027t be stopped.\n I reach a hand forward on her belly and push her butt out more as the paddle comes down, lighting her ass cheeks up for me. My exhale is ragged and more of a shudder.\n \"Touch your toes together,\" I growl at her, forgetting who she is. She does it fast, breathing into the bedding. I hit a second time and a third. She is writhing and moaning. I pull her back a bit and arch her back more so the next hit vibrates against her pussy. She moans harder. I start to get scared she\u0027s going to cum again and I\u0027ve made something much worse than me.\n \"Faster,\" she mutters breathlessly into the blanket.\n My heart is beating out of control; what have I done? She can never go back to being normal after this. You can\u0027t like this and then go back. I give her a chuckle and a line I\u0027ve used before, \"No, no, no. You\u0027ve had an orgasm. You don’t get another one.\" I hit a bit harder, trying to make it less enjoyable. \"That\u0027s my girl.\"\n I don’t know how else to make it horrid than to make her feel like a slut, so I drop the paddle, rip her panties down, and unzip my pants harshly. I shove my swollen cock into her roughly. The reality of what I\u0027m doing makes me sick. I close my eyes and push her down harder. I make noises like I\u0027ve cum, she\u0027s so wet that she won\u0027t be able to tell I didn’t. I fake my orgasm and turn to leave quickly before she can see my raging hard on. I am close to punching a hole in my walls and tearing the fucking house apart, when I get to the living room. I barely manage to get my pants on after a couple minutes trying to squeeze the zipper over my cock.\n I get a drink of water but I can\u0027t get it down my throat. I leave the glass on the counter.\n I am pacing and running my hands through my hair like a psycho when I hear her feet on the hallway. She must think I\u0027m a monster. I shake my head and wait for it. She\u0027s going to scream and hate me and leave and go to that fucker Sebastian.\n Fuck.\n She does something much worse and even more unexpected. She is silent and leaves like the other girls. She isn’t mad at me, she is hurt.\n She doesn’t look at me so I say the only thing I can think of, \"Don\u0027t leave.\"\n It\u0027s a stupid-ass thing to say to a girl you just treated like a whore, but I have got nothing else. The elevator comes and my heart shatters into a thousand pieces.\n She shakes her head, still not looking at me, \"I don’t want your money anymore. Or anything. I\u0027ll make it work on my own.\" She steps into the elevator and presses a button. The look on her face is worse than anything I have ever seen on her. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lost-boy-the-lonely-2/page-23.html","bookId":1889,"book":{"id":1889,"title":"Lost Boy (The Lonely #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Lost Boy (The Lonely #2) \n 19+ \n Being the boy who accidentally shot his sister was hard. \n Never being able to find the girl who actually pulled the trigger was worse. \n Convinced, through years of relentless therapy, that she was a figment of his trauma and imagination, Eli Adams gave up on her existence. \n Until one day a name, bearing remarkable resemblance to the people missing in his life, showed up out of nowhere. \n Suddenly he was thrust into a journey that forced him to offer up his soul as payment for the truth. \n What he discovered along the way, was that the girl who took his sister\u0027s life and his hand, all those years ago, had become the thing he needed to be whole. \n Saving her was one thing. \n Healing her was another. \n Convincing her to love him will be the toughest part of it all.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/lost-boy-the-lonely-2.jpg","author":"Tara Brown","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/lost-boy-the-lonely-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:40 PM"}}
