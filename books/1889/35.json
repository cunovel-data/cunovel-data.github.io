Mine sucked, she fixed it.\"\n I nod, \"Well, you\u0027ll make an excellent journalist and we can hire a cook.\"\n She shakes her head, \"I\u0027m going to get this.\" We get back downstairs and she gives me a funny look.\n \"What?\"\n She walks to the tree and takes an envelope from it. \"I better give you yours too. I don’t think you want to open this in front of my parents.\"\n I scowl. If she did the naughty photo session, I won\u0027t be happy.\n I feel the permanent scowl on my face as I open the envelope. I don’t get sexy, naked pictures of my fiancé though. Instead, I get a hand-written letter in broken English. I frown, \"What is this?\"\n \"Read it.\"\n \"Dear Master Adam. I be in good health. Auntie Cici tell me to write to you because you give us moneys and makes us rich. My school be good too. I learned English and I like it. I hope we come see you soon. I have my own bed room and auntie cici crys a lot. I says why and she says cause shes so happy. She says you are angel. Me and my cousins have a big back yard and a pool. I like swimming in the blue water better than the river. It is nice. Thanks to you, Simone.\"\n I look at her, \"How?\"\n She grins, tears filling her eyes, \"I found Dean a month ago and I asked your father to help set them up for life—I knew you would want it. He went overboard and made them millionaires, but I don’t think they mind, and I don’t think he notices the money being gone. It was not really that much.\"\n I am stunned. I think she was less stunned when I proposed. I shake my head, \"This is the greatest thing you have ever done. Anyone has ever done. I don’t even know how to thank you. It\u0027s the best gift ever.\"\n She nods and holds up the ring, \"I beat you.\"\n I laugh, \"You did. That was amazing. Now let\u0027s go to bed so I can beat you.\" I bring the letter with me to bed; I want to read it again. I want to read it every day. I love that she took the initiative to hunt down Dean and he found the girl. I love everything about this gift and this Christmas. It\u0027s perfect, maybe not normal, but it\u0027s perfect.\n I kiss the top of her head and lead her down the hallway. I don’t know if I deserve any of it, but I am grateful for it all.\n The End \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/lost-boy-the-lonely-2/page-35.html","bookId":1889,"book":{"id":1889,"title":"Lost Boy (The Lonely #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Lost Boy (The Lonely #2) \n 19+ \n Being the boy who accidentally shot his sister was hard. \n Never being able to find the girl who actually pulled the trigger was worse. \n Convinced, through years of relentless therapy, that she was a figment of his trauma and imagination, Eli Adams gave up on her existence. \n Until one day a name, bearing remarkable resemblance to the people missing in his life, showed up out of nowhere. \n Suddenly he was thrust into a journey that forced him to offer up his soul as payment for the truth. \n What he discovered along the way, was that the girl who took his sister\u0027s life and his hand, all those years ago, had become the thing he needed to be whole. \n Saving her was one thing. \n Healing her was another. \n Convincing her to love him will be the toughest part of it all.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/lost-boy-the-lonely-2.jpg","author":"Tara Brown","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/lost-boy-the-lonely-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:06 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:01:40 PM"}}
