Mine sucked, she fixed it.\" I nod, \"Well, you\u0027ll make an excellent journalist and we can hire a cook.\" She shakes her head, \"I\u0027m going to get this.\" We get back downstairs and she gives me a funny look. \"What?\" She walks to the tree and takes an envelope from it. \"I better give you yours too. I don’t think you want to open this in front of my parents.\" I scowl. If she did the naughty photo session, I won\u0027t be happy. I feel the permanent scowl on my face as I open the envelope. I don’t get sexy, naked pictures of my fiancé though. Instead, I get a hand-written letter in broken English. I frown, \"What is this?\" \"Read it.\" \"Dear Master Adam. I be in good health. Auntie Cici tell me to write to you because you give us moneys and makes us rich. My school be good too. I learned English and I like it. I hope we come see you soon. I have my own bed room and auntie cici crys a lot. I says why and she says cause shes so happy. She says you are angel. Me and my cousins have a big back yard and a pool. I like swimming in the blue water better than the river. It is nice. Thanks to you, Simone.\" I look at her, \"How?\" She grins, tears filling her eyes, \"I found Dean a month ago and I asked your father to help set them up for life—I knew you would want it. He went overboard and made them millionaires, but I don’t think they mind, and I don’t think he notices the money being gone. It was not really that much.\" I am stunned. I think she was less stunned when I proposed. I shake my head, \"This is the greatest thing you have ever done. Anyone has ever done. I don’t even know how to thank you. It\u0027s the best gift ever.\" She nods and holds up the ring, \"I beat you.\" I laugh, \"You did. That was amazing. Now let\u0027s go to bed so I can beat you.\" I bring the letter with me to bed; I want to read it again. I want to read it every day. I love that she took the initiative to hunt down Dean and he found the girl. I love everything about this gift and this Christmas. It\u0027s perfect, maybe not normal, but it\u0027s perfect. I kiss the top of her head and lead her down the hallway. I don’t know if I deserve any of it, but I am grateful for it all.
