{"id":1889,"title":"Lost Boy (The Lonely #2)","description":"Storyline: Lost Boy (The Lonely #2) 19+ Being the boy who accidentally shot his sister was hard. Never being able to find the girl who actually pulled the trigger was worse. Convinced, through years of relentless therapy, that she was a figment of his trauma and imagination, Eli Adams gave up on her existence. Until one day a name, bearing remarkable resemblance to the people missing in his life, showed up out of nowhere. Suddenly he was thrust into a journey that forced him to offer up his soul as payment for the truth. What he discovered along the way, was that the girl who took his sister\u0027s life and his hand, all those years ago, had become the thing he needed to be whole. Saving her was one thing. Healing her was another. Convincing her to love him will be the toughest part of it all.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/lost-boy-the-lonely-2.jpg","author":"Tara Brown","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":35,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
