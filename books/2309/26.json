{"id":95562,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"For a time, it seemed as though she would recover. Her appetite increased. She got out of bed for longer and longer periods of time; she asked Montroy to take her into the maze where she sat for over an hour, staring at the rosebushes, at the statues of the raven and the wolf.\\n\\n She seemed at peace there, and for a time, Montroy hoped she had accepted the fact that Rayven was gone. Now, he thought, now she\u0027ll turn to me and we can begin our life together.\\n\\n But it was not to be.\\n\\n For no apparent reason, she went into a decline that came on rapidly, without warning. As the days passed, she grew ever weaker. Her mother and sisters came, bringing sweet treats to tempt her appetite, plying her with hot tea, smiling with forced gaiety as they told her of Aileen\u0027s pregnancy, hoping that the thought of a new life would bring her back from the depths of her despair.\\n\\n But it was all in vain. She looked at them through eyes devoid of life even as she assured them she would be better soon.\\n\\n Montroy summoned his family physician, but the man only shook his head, declaring there was nothing physically wrong with her.\\n\\n Ada summoned the village priest, who laid his hands upon Rhianna\u0027s head, then turned away, promising he would light a candle and offer prayers for the welfare of her soul.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s willing herself to die.\" Ada stood beside her daughter\u0027s bed, staring down into Rhianna\u0027s pale face.\\n\\n Montroy nodded. \"I fear you are right, madam.\" He cursed softly, wondering if Rayven had foreseen such a thing happening when he took his leave.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all that monster\u0027s fault,\" Ada said bitterly. \"He\u0027s put a curse on her.\"\\n\\n Montroy started to object. He didn\u0027t believe in magic, white or black. He thought of all the rumors he had heard about Rayven, the gossip, the speculation. Once, he had laughed it all aside. There were no such things as monsters who stalked the night, draining the life\u0027s blood out of others. But then he looked at Rhianna\u0027s pale face, at the dark shadows beneath her eyes, the hollows in her cheeks, and wondered if the rumors might not be true, after all.\\n\\n He sat by her bed, holding her hand, while Ada McLeod urged her daughter to drink a little tea, felt his hatred grow until it became a living thing within him as he saw the empty look in Rhianna\u0027s once bright eyes. He heard her whisper Rayven\u0027s name, her voice barely audible, before she fell back on the pillows.\\n\\n Stifling a sob, Ada turned away from the bed. Bevins materialized out of the shadows. For a moment, he watched her weep and then, needing to comfort her, he stepped forward and took Ada into his arms.\\n\\n For a moment, she stood stiff in his embrace, and then she collapsed against him. Feeling awkward, he stroked her hair and back, his gentle touch releasing the tears she had refused to shed.\\n\\n Montroy felt his throat thicken as he listened to Ada McLeod weeping for her daughter.\\n\\n He lifted Rhianna\u0027s hand to his lips and kissed her palm, afraid, deep in his heart, that she would never recover.\\n\\n \"Damn you, Rayven,\" he muttered. \"I hope your soul is burning in Hell.\"\\n\\n He woke with the setting sun. Staring into the crypt\u0027s darkness, he remembered how he had gone seeking death and how, when it had been within his grasp, he had discovered he wanted very much to live.\\n\\n He had been hovering on the brink of oblivion when his skin began to tighten. Near the edge of eternity, he had smelled the coming dawn, had heard Rhianna\u0027s voice, growing ever weaker, echoing in his mind, begging him not to leave her, and he had known that, if he died, she would die, too. It was a burden too heavy to bear. He had been ready to end his own life, but he could not take hers, not when she had hardly lived at all.\\n\\n With a strength of will he hadn\u0027t known he possessed, he had dragged himself toward the crypt in which he now lay. The door had been partly open, and he had squeezed in through the narrow crack. The rusty hinges had creaked loudly, shrieking like a soul in torment, as he pulled the door closed behind him and then, breathing heavily, his nostrils filling with the musty odor of old death, he had crawled into a corner and fallen into a deep, deep sleep.\\n\\n How many suns had set since he took refuge here, he wondered. Ten? Twenty? He had lost count.\\n\\n His stomach churned with disgust as he looked at the small furry bodies of mice and rats that littered the floor of the tomb. And yet their blood, repulsive though it might be, had kept him alive - that and his ever-growing need to see Rhianna again.\\n\\n She was dying. He could feel her vitality ebbing along with her will to survive, and he knew that he was to blame. They were linked together by the blood they shared. But, unlike him, she was subject to the weakness of the flesh.\\n\\n Salvatore, help me...\\n\\n He closed his eyes, and the old Vampyre\u0027s image rose up in his mind. Salvatore. Slightly built, his black hair combed back, his dark brown eyes filled with the wisdom of the ages.\\n\\n Rayven smiled faintly. Salvatore looked nothing like the Vampyres of legend. A dapper man, with a thin moustache and refined features. A man who knew what he was and accepted it.\\n\\n To be Vampyre is not for the weak,Salvatore had once told him. Eternity can be very tiring if one does not keep oneself amused. You must keep up with the world, or you will drown in the past.\\n\\n You can be a monster, preying off the life\u0027s blood of others, or not. The choice is up to you...\\n\\n With an effort, he rose to his feet, ran a hand through his hair, settled his cloak around his shoulders.\\n\\n Tonight, for the first time since he had sought death, he would hunt the streets of the city. And then he would go to her and beg her forgiveness.\\n\\n If he was not too late. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-darker-dream/page-26.html","bookId":2309,"book":{"id":2309,"title":"A Darker Dream","description":"Storyline: In four hundred years, Rayven has never met a woman like Rhianna McLeod. She is a vision of light, of warmth, of everything he is not—nor can ever be. Doomed to live forever in darkness and solitude, he knows all too well the risk of getting close to her, yet he hungers for her with a fierce passion he\u0027s sworn he\u0027ll never allow himself to feel. \\n Rhianna\u0027s father sells her to Rayven to put food on the table—so she has no choice but to go with the dark stranger. To her surprise, he gives her everything she wants—the finest clothes, education, and the run of the castle—everything, that is, except his touch. For although she senses danger beneath his soft-spoken manner, although even Rayven himself warns her away, she is drawn to this creature of the night, and loves him as she can no other.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-darker-dream.jpg","author":"Amanda Ashley","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-darker-dream.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:35 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:15:06 PM"}}
