{"id":26263,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 27 Travel Plans","content":"i took mythology a lot more seriously since I\u0027d become a vampire. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Often, when I looked back over my first three months as an immortal, I imagined how the thread of mylife might look in the Fates\u0027 loom—who knew but that it actually existed? I was sure my thread must havechanged color; I thought it had probably started out as a nice beige, something supportive andnon-confrontational, something that would look good in the background. Now it felt like it must be brightcrimson, or maybe glistening gold. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　The tapestry of family and friends that wove together around me was a beautiful, glowing thing, full oftheir bright, complementary colors. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　I was surprised by some of the threads I got to include in my life. The werewolves, with their deep,woodsy colors, were not something I\u0027d expected; Jacob, of course, and Seth, too. But my old friendsQuil and Embry became part of the fabric as they joined Jacob\u0027s pack, and even Sam and Emily werecordial. The tensions between our families eased, mostly due to Renesmee. She was easy to love. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Sue and Leah Clearwater were interlaced into our life, too—two more I had not anticipated. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Sue seemed to have taken it on herself to smooth Charlie\u0027s transition into the world of make-believe. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　She came with him to the Cullens\u0027 most days, though she never seemed truly comfortable here the wayher son and most of Jake\u0027s pack did. She did not speak often; she just hovered protectively near Charlie. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　She was always the first person he looked to when Renesmee did something disturbingly advanced—which was often. In answer, Sue would eye Seth meaningfully as if to say, Yeah, tell me about it. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Leah was even less comfortable than Sue and was the only part of our recently extended family whowas openly hostile to the merger. However, she and Jacob had a new camaraderie that kept her close tous all. I asked him about it once—hesitantly; I didn\u0027t want to pry, but the relationship was so differentfrom the way it used to be that it made me curious. He shrugged and told me it was a pack thing. Shewas his second-in-command now, his \"beta,\" asI\u0027d called it once long ago. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\"I figured as long as I was going to do this Alpha thing for real,\" Jacob explained, \"I\u0027d better nail downthe formalities.\"The new responsibility made Leah feel the need to check in with him often, and since he was always withRenesmee... \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Leah was not happy to be near us, but she was the exception. Happiness was the main component in mylife now, the dominant pattern in the tapestry. So much so that my relationship with Jasper was now muchcloser than I\u0027d ever dreamed it would be. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　At first I was really annoyed, though. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\"Yeesh!\" I complained to Edward one night after we\u0027d put Renesmee in her wrought-iron crib. \"If Ihaven\u0027t killed Charlie or Sue yet, it\u0027s probably not going to happen. I wish Jasper would stop hovering allthe time!\"\"No one doubts you, Bella, not in the slightest,\" he assured me. \"You know how Jasper is—he can\u0027tresist a good emotional climate. You\u0027re so happy all the time, love, he gravitates toward you withoutthinking.\"And then Edward hugged me tightly, because nothing pleased him more than my overwhelming ecstasyin this new life. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　And I was euphoric the vast majority of the time. The days were not long enough for me to get my fill ofadoring my daughter; the nights did not have enough hours to satisfy my need for Edward. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　There was a flipside to the joy, though. If you turned the fabric of our lives over, I imagined the designon the backside would be woven in the bleak grays of doubt and fear. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Renesmee spoke her first word when she was exactly one week old. The word was Momma, whichwould have made my day, except that I was so frightened by her progress I could barely force my frozenface to smile back at her. It didn\u0027t help that she continued from her first word to her first sentence in thesame breath. \"Momma, where is Grandpa?\" she\u0027d asked in a clear, high soprano, only bothering to speakaloud because I was across the room from her. She\u0027d already asked Rosalie, using her normal (orseriously abnormal, from another point of view) means of communication. Rosalie hadn\u0027t known theanswer, so Renesmee had turned to me. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　When she walked for the first time, fewer than three weeks later, it was similar. She\u0027d simply stared atAlice for a long moment, watching intently as her aunt arranged bouquets in the vases scattered aroundthe room, dancing back and forth across the floor with her arms full of flowers. Renesmee got to her feet,not in the least bit shaky, and crossed the floor almost as gracefully. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Jacob had burst into applause, because that was clearly the response Renesmee wanted. The way hewas tied to her made his own reactions secondary; his first reflex was always to give Renesmee whatevershe needed. But our eyes met, and I saw all the panic in mine echoed in his. I made my hands claptogether, too, trying to hide my fear from her. Edward applauded quietly at my side, and we didn\u0027t needto speak our thoughts to know they were the same. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Edward and Carlisle threw themselves into research, looking for any answers, anything to expect. Therewasvery little to be found, and none of it verifiable. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Alice and Rosalie usually began our day with a fashion show. Renesmee never wore the same clothestwice, partly because she outgrew her clothes almost immediately and partly because Alice and Rosaliewere trying to create a baby album that appeared to span years rather than weeks. They took thousandsof pictures, documenting every phase of her accelerated childhood. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　At three months, Renesmee could have been a big one-year-old, or a small two-year-old. She wasn\u0027tshaped exactly like a toddler; she was leaner and more graceful, her proportions were more even, like anadult\u0027s. Her bronze ringlets hung to her waist; I couldn\u0027t bear to cut them, even if Alice would haveallowed it. Renesmee could speak with flawless grammar and articulation, but she rarely bothered,preferring to simply show people what she wanted. She could not only walk but run and dance. Shecould even read. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　I\u0027d been reading Tennyson to her one night, because the flow and rhythm of his poetry seemed restful. (Ihad to search constantly for new material; Renesmee didn\u0027t like repetition in her bedtime stories as otherchildren supposedly did, and she had no patience for picture books.) She reached up to touch my cheek,the image in her mind one of us, only with her holding the book. I gave it to her, smiling. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\" There is sweet music here,\u0027\" she read without hesitation, \"\u0027that softer falls than petals from blown roseson the grass, or night-dews on still waters between walls of shadowy granite, in a gleaming pass—\u0027\"My hand was robotic as I took the book back. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\"If you read, how will you fall asleep?\" I asked in a voice that had barely escaped shaking. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　By Carlisle\u0027s calculations, the growth of her body was gradually slowing; her mind continued to race onahead. Even if the rate of decrease held steady, she\u0027d still be an adult in no more than four years. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Four years. And an old woman by fifteen. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Just fifteen years of life. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　But she was so healthy. Vital, bright, glowing, and happy. Her conspicuous well-being made it easy forme to be happy with her in the moment and leave the future for tomorrow. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Carlisle and Edward discussed our options for the future from every angle in low voices that I tried notto hear. They never had these discussions when Jacob was around, because there was one sure way tohalt aging, and that wasn\u0027t something Jacob was likely to be excited about. I wasn\u0027t. Too dangerous! myinstincts screamed at me. Jacob and Renesmee seemed alike in so many ways, both half-and-half beings,two things at the same time. And all the werewolf lore insisted that vampire venom was a death sentencerather than a course to immortality___Carlisle and Edward had exhausted the research they could do from a distance, and now we werepreparing to follow old legends at their source. We were going back to Brazil, starting there. The Ticunashad legends about children like Renesmee.... If other children like her had ever existed, perhaps sometale of the life span of half-mortal children still lingered___The only real question left was exactly when we would go. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　I was the holdup. A small part of it was that I wanted to stay near Forks until after the holidays, forCharlie\u0027ssake. But more than that, there was a different journey that I knew had to come first—that was the clearpriority. Also, it had to be a solo trip. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　This was the only argument that Edward and I had gotten in since I\u0027d become a vampire. The main pointof contention was the \"solo\" part. But the facts were what they were, and my plan was the only one thatmade rational sense. I had to go see the Volturi, and I had to do it absolutely alone. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Even freed from old nightmares, from any dreams at all, it was impossible to forget the Volturi. Nor didthey leave us without reminders. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Until the day that Aro\u0027s present showed up, i didn\u0027t know that Alice had sent a wedding announcementto the Volturi leaders; we\u0027d been far away on Esme\u0027s island when she\u0027d seen a vision of Volturi soldiers—Jane and Alec, the devastatingly powerful twins, among them. Caius was planning to send a huntingparty to see if I was still human, against their edict (because I knew about the secret vampire world, Ieither must join it or be silenced... permanently). So Alice had mailed the announcement, seeing that thiswould delay them as they deciphered the meaning behind it. But they would come eventually. That wascertain. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　The present itself was not overtly threatening. Extravagant, yes, almost frightening in that veryextravagance. The threat was in the parting line of Aro\u0027s congratulatory note, written in black ink on asquare of heavy, plain white paper in Aro\u0027s own hand: \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　I so look forward to seeing the new Mrs. Cullen in person. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　The gift was presented in an ornately carved, ancient wooden box inlaid with gold and mother-of-pearl,ornamented with a rainbow of gemstones. Alice said the box itself was a priceless treasure, that it wouldhave outshone just about any piece of jewelry besides the one inside it. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\"I always wondered where the crown jewels disappeared to after John of England pawned them in thethirteenth century,\" Carlisle said. \"I suppose it doesn\u0027t surprise me that the Volturi have their share.\"The necklace was simple—gold woven into a thick rope of a chain, almost scaled, like a smooth snakethat would curl close around the throat. One jewel hung suspended from the rope; a white diamond thesize of a golf ball. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　The unsubtle reminder in Aro\u0027s note interested me more than the jewel. The Volturi needed to see that Iwas immortal, that the Cullens had been obedient to the Volturi\u0027s orders, and they needed to see thissoon. They could not be allowed near Forks. There was only one way to keep our life here safe. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\"You\u0027re not going alone,\" Edward had insisted through his teeth, his hands clenching into fists. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\"They won\u0027t hurt me,\" I\u0027d said as soothingly as I could manage, forcing my voice to sound sure. \"Theyhave no reason to. I\u0027m a vampire. Case closed.\"\"No. Absolutely no.\"\"Edward, it\u0027s the only way to protect her.\"And he hadn\u0027t been able to argue with that. My logic was watertight. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Even in the short time I\u0027d known Aro, I\u0027d been able to see that he was a collector—and his most prizedtreasures were his living pieces. He coveted beauty, talent, and rarity in his immortal followers more thanany jewel locked in his vaults. It was unfortunate enough that he\u0027d begun to covet Alice\u0027s and Edward\u0027sabilities. I would give him no more reason to be jealous of Carlisle\u0027s family. Renesmee was beautiful andgifted and unique—she was one of a kind. He could not be allowed to see her, not even throughsomeone\u0027s thoughts. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　And I was the only one whose thoughts he could not hear. Of course I would go alone. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Alice did not see any trouble with my trip, but she was worried by the indistinct quality of her visions. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　She said they were sometimes similarly hazy when there were outside decisions that might conflict butthat had not been solidly resolved. This uncertainty made Edward, already hesitant, extremely opposedto what I had to do. He wanted to come with me as far as my connection in London, but I wouldn\u0027t leaveRenesmee without both her parents. Carlisle was coming instead. It made both Edward and me a littlemore relaxed, knowing that Carlisle would be only a few hours away from me. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Alice kept searching for the future, but the things she found were unrelated to what she was looking for. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　A new trend in the stock market; a possible visit of reconciliation from Irina, though her decision was notfirm; a snowstorm that wouldn\u0027t hit for another six weeks; a call from Renee (I was practicing my \"rough\"voice, and getting better at it every day—to Renee\u0027s knowledge, I was still sick, but mending). \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　We bought the tickets for Italy the day after Renesmee turned three months. I planned for it to be a veryshort trip, so I hadn\u0027t told Charlie about it. Jacob knew, and he took Edward\u0027s view on things. However,today the argument was about Brazil. Jacob was determined to come with us. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　The three of us, Jacob, Renesmee, and I, were hunting together. The diet of animal blood wasn\u0027tRenesmee\u0027s favorite thing—and that was why Jacob was allowed to come along. Jacob had made it acontest between them, and that made her more willing than anything else. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Renesmee was quite clear on the whole good vs. bad as it applied to hunting humans; she just thoughtthat donated blood made a nice compromise. Human food filled her and it seemed compatible with hersystem, but she reacted to all varieties of solid food with the same martyred endurance I had once givencauliflower and lima beans. Animal blood was better than that, at least. She had a competitive nature,and the challenge of beating Jacob made her excited to hunt. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\"Jacob,\" I said, trying to reason with him again while Renesmee danced ahead of us into the longclearing, searching for a scent she liked. \"You\u0027ve got obligations here. Seth, Leah—\"He snorted. \"I\u0027m not my pack\u0027s nanny. They\u0027ve all got responsibilities in La Push anyway.\"\"Sort of like you? Are you officially dropping out of high school, then? If you\u0027re going to keep up withRenesmee, you\u0027re going to have to study a lot harder.\"\"It\u0027s just a sabbatical. I\u0027ll get back to school when things... slow down.\"I lost my concentration on my side of the disagreement when he said that, and we both automaticallylooked atRenesmee. She was staring at the snowflakes fluttering high above her head, melting before they couldstick to the yellowed grass in the long arrowhead-shaped meadow that we were standing in. Her ruffledivory dress was just a shade darker than the snow, and her reddish-brown curls managed to shimmer,though the sun was buried deeply behind the clouds. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　As we watched, she crouched for an instant and then sprang fifteen feet up into the air. Her little handsclosed around a flake, and she dropped lightly to her feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　She turned to us with her shocking smile—truly, it wasn\u0027t something you could get used to—and openedher hands to show us the perfectly formed eight-pointed ice star in her palm before it melted. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\"Pretty,\" Jacob called to her appreciatively. \"But I think you\u0027re stalling, Nessie.\"She bounded back to Jacob; he held his arms out at exactly the moment she leaped into them. They hadthe move perfectly synchronized. She did this when she had something to say. She still preferred not tospeak aloud. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Renesmee touched his face, scowling adorably as we all listened to the sound of a small herd of elkmoving farther into the wood. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\"Suuuureyou\u0027re not thirsty, Nessie,\" Jacob answered a little sarcastically, but more indulgently thananything else. \"You\u0027re just afraid HI catch the biggest one again!\"She flipped backward out of Jacob\u0027s arms, landing lightly on her feet, and rolled her eyes—she lookedso much like Edward when she did that. Then she darted off toward the trees. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\"Got it,\" Jacob said when I leaned as if to follow. He yanked his t-shirt off as he charged after her intothe forest, already trembling. \"It doesn\u0027t count if you cheat,\" he called to Renesmee. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　I smiled at the leaves they left fluttering behind them, shaking my head. Jacob was more a child thanRenesmee sometimes. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　I paused, giving my hunters a few minutes\u0027 head start. It would be beyond simple to track them, andRenesmee would love to surprise me with the size of her prey. I smiled again. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　The narrow meadow was very still, very empty. The fluttering snow was thinning above me, almostgone. Alice had seen that it wouldn\u0027t stick for many weeks. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Usually Edward and I came together on these hunting trips. But Edward was with Carlisle today,planning the trip to Rio, talking behind Jacob\u0027s back.... I frowned. When I returned, I would take Jacob\u0027sside. He should come with us. He had as big a stake in this as any of us—his entire life was at stake, justlike mine. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　While my thoughts were lost in the near future, my eyes swept the mountainside routinely, searching forprey, searching for danger. I didn\u0027t think about it; the urge was an automatic thing. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Or perhaps there was a reason for my scanning, some tiny trigger that my razor-sharp senses had caughtbefore I realized it consciously. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　As my eyes flitted across the edge of a distant cliff, standing out starkly blue-gray against thegreen-black forest, a glint of silver—or was it gold?—gripped my attention. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　My gaze zeroed in on the color that shouldn\u0027t have been there, so far away in the haze that an eaglewouldn\u0027thave been able to make it out. I stared. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　She stared back. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　That she was a vampire was obvious. Her skin was marble white, the texture a million times smootherthan human skin. Even under the clouds, she glistened ever so slightly. If her skin had not given her away,her stillness would have. Only vampires and statues could be so perfectly motionless. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Her hair was pale, pale blond, almost silver. This was the gleam that had caught my eye. It hung straightas a ruler to a blunt edge at her chin, parted evenly down the center. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　She was a stranger to me. I was absolutely certain I\u0027d never seen her before, even as a human. None ofthe faces in my muddy memory were the same as this one. But I knew her at once from her dark goldeneyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Irina had decided to come after all. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　For one moment I stared at her, and she stared back. I wondered if she would guess immediately who Iwas as well. I half-raised my hand, about to wave, but her lip twisted the tiniest bit, making her facesuddenly hostile. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　I heard Renesmee\u0027s cry of victory from the forest, heard Jacob\u0027s echoing howl, and saw Irina\u0027s face jerkreflexively to the sound when it echoed to her a few seconds later. Her gaze cut slightly to the right, and Iknew what she was seeing. An enormous russet werewolf, perhaps the very one who had killed herLaurent. How long had she been watching us? Long enough to see our affectionate exchange before, Iwas sure. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Her face spasmed in pain. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Instinctually, I opened my hands in front of me in an apologetic gesture. She turned back to me, and herlip curled back over her teeth. Her jaw unlocked as she growled. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　When the faint sound reached me, she had already turned and disappeared into the forest. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\"Crap!\" I groaned. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　I sprinted into the forest after Renesmee and Jacob, unwilling to have them out of my sight. I didn\u0027t knowwhich direction Irina had taken, or exactly how furious she was right now. Vengeance was a commonobsession for vampires, one that was not easy to suppress. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Running at full speed, it only took me two seconds to reach them. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\"Mine is bigger,\" I heard Renesmee insist as I burst through the thick thornbushes to the small openspace where they stood. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Jacob\u0027s ears flattened as he took in my expression; he crouched forward, baring his teeth—hismuzzlewas streaked with blood from his kill. His eyes raked the forest. I could hear the growl building in histhroat. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Renesmee was every bit as alert as Jacob. Abandoning the dead stag at her feet, she leaped into mywaiting arms, pressing her curious hands against my cheeks. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\"I\u0027m overreacting,\" I assured them quickly. \"It\u0027s okay, I think. Hold on.\"I pulled out my cell phone and hit the speed dial. Edward answered on the first ring. Jacob andRenesmee listened intently to my side as I filled Edward in. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\"Come, bring Carlisle,\" I trilled so fast I wondered if Jacob could keep up. \"I saw Irina, and she saw me,but thenshe saw Jacob and she got mad and ran away, I think. She hasn\u0027t shown up here—yet, anyway—butshe looked pretty upset so maybe she will. If she doesn\u0027t, you and Carlisle have to go after her and talkto her. I feel so bad.\"Jacob rumbled. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\"We\u0027ll be there in half a minute,\" Edward assured me, and I could hear the whoosh of the wind hisrunning made. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　We darted back to the long meadow and then waited silently as Jacob and I listened carefully for thesound of an approach we did not recognize. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　When the sound came, though, it was very familiar. And then Edward was at my side, Carlisle a fewseconds behind. I was surprised to hear the heavy pad of big paws following behind Carlisle. I supposedI shouldn\u0027t have been shocked. With Renesmee in even a hint of danger, of course Jacob would call inreinforcements. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\"She was up on that ridge,\" I told them at once, pointing out the spot. If Irina was fleeing, she alreadyhad quite a head start. Would she stop and listen to Carlisle? Her expression before made me think not. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　\"Maybe you should call Emmett and Jasper and have them come with you. She looked... really upset. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　She growled at me.\"\"What?\" Edward said angrily. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Carlisle put a hand on his arm. \"She\u0027s grieving. HI go after her.\"Tm coming with you,\" Edward insisted. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　They exchanged a long glance—perhaps Carlisle was measuring Edward\u0027s irritation with Irina against hishelpfulness as a mind reader. Finally, Carlisle nodded, and they took off to find the trail without calling forJasper or Emmett. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Jacob huffed impatiently and poked my back with his nose. He must want Renesmee back at the safetyof the house, just in case. I agreed with him on that, and we hurried home with Seth and Leah running atour flanks. \\n\\n \\n\\n 　　Renesmee was complacent in my arms, one hand still resting on my face. Since the hunting trip had beenaborted, she would just have to make do with donated blood. Her thoughts were a little smug. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/151/5994.html","bookId":740,"book":{"id":740,"title":"暮光之城：破晓 Breaking Dawn","description":"简介： Bella and Edward are married, but their honeymoon is cut short when Bella discovers that she is pregnant.
