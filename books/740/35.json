{"id":26274,"no":35,"title":"Chapter 38 Power","content":"\"Chelsea is trying to break our bindings,\" Edward whispered. \"But she can\u0027t find them. She can\u0027t feel ushere. . . .\" His eyes cut to me. \"Are you doing that?\"I smiled grimly at him. \"I am all over this.\"Edward lurched away from me suddenly, his hand reaching out toward Carlisle. At the same time, I felta much sharper jab against the shield where it wrapped protectively around Carlisle\u0027s light. It wasn\u0027tpainful, but it wasn\u0027t pleasant, either. 　　\"Carlisle? Are you all right?\" Edward gasped frantically. 　　\"Yes. Why?\"\"Jane,\" Edward answered. 　　The moment that he said her name, a dozen pointed attacks hit in a second, stabbing all over the elasticshield, aimed at twelve different bright spots. I flexed, making sure the shield was undamaged. It didn\u0027tseem like Jane had been able to pierce it. I glanced around quickly; everyone was fine. 　　\"Incredible,\" Edward said. 　　\"Why aren\u0027t they waiting for the decision?\" Tanya hissed. 　　\"Normal procedure,\" Edward answered brusquely. \"They usually incapacitate those on trial so they can\u0027tescape.\"I looked across at Jane, who was staring at our group with furious disbelief. I was pretty sure that,besides me, she\u0027d never seen anyone remain standing through her fiery assault. 　　It probably wasn\u0027t very mature. But I figured it would take Aro about half a second to guess—if hehadn\u0027t already—that my shield was more powerful than Edward had known; I already had a big target onmy forehead and there was really no point in trying to keep the extent of what I could do a secret. So Igrinned a huge, smug smile rightat Jane. 　　Her eyes narrowed, and I felt another stab of pressure, this time directed at me. 　　I pulled my lips wider, showing my teeth. 　　Jane let out a high-pitched scream of a snarl. Everyone jumped, even the disciplined guard. Everyonebut the ancients, who didn\u0027t so much as look up from their conference. Her twin caught her arm as shecrouched to spring. 　　The Romanians started chuckling with dark anticipation. 　　\"I told you this was our time,\" Vladimir said to Stefan. 　　\"Just look at the witch\u0027s face,\" Stefan chortled. 　　Alec patted his sister\u0027s shoulder soothingly, then tucked her under his arm. He turned his face to us,perfectly smooth, completely angelic. 　　I waited for some pressure, some sign of his attack, but I felt nothing. He continued to stare in ourdirection, his pretty face composed. Was he attacking? Was he getting through my shield? Was I the onlyone who could still see him? I clutched at Edward\u0027s hand. 　　\"Are you okay?\" I choked out. 　　\"Yes,\" he whispered. 　　\"Is Alec trying?\"Edward nodded. \"His gift is slower than Jane\u0027s. It creeps. It will touch us in a few seconds.\"I saw it then, when I had a clue of what to look for. 　　A strange clear haze was oozing across the snow, nearly invisible against the white. It reminded me of amirage—a slight warping of the view, a hint of a shimmer. I pushed my shield out from Carlisle and therest of the front line, afraid to have the slinking mist too close when it hit. What if it stole right through myintangible protection? Should we run? 　　A low rumbling murmured through the ground under our feet, and a gust of wind blew the snow intosudden flurries between our position and the Voituri\u0027s. Benjamin had seen the creeping threat, too, andnow he tried to blow the mist away from us. The snow made it easy to see where he threw the wind, butthe mist didn\u0027t react in any way. It was like air blowing harmlessly through a shadow; the shadow wasimmune. 　　The triangular formation of the ancients finally broke apart when, with a racking groan, a deep, narrowfissure opened in a long zigzag across the middle of the clearing. The earth rocked under my feet for amoment. The drifts of snow plummeted into the hole, but the mist skipped right across it, as untouched bygravity as it had been by wind. 　　Aro and Caius watched the opening earth with wide eyes. Marcus looked in the same direction withoutemotion. 　　They didn\u0027t speak; they waited, too, as the mist approached us. The wind shrieked louder but didn\u0027tchange the course of the mist. Jane was smiling now. 　　And then the mist hit a wall. 　　I could taste it as soon as it touched my shield—it had a dense, sweet, cloying flavor, it made meremember dimly the numbness of Novocain on my tongue. 　　The mist curled upward, seeking a breach, a weakness. It found none. The fingers of searching hazetwisted upward and around, trying to find a way in, and in the process illustrating the astonishing size ofthe protective screen. 　　There were gasps on both sides of Benjamin\u0027s gorge. 　　\"Well done, Bella!\u00277Benjamin cheered in a low voice. 　　My smile returned. 　　I could see Alec\u0027s narrowed eyes, doubt on his face for the first time as his mist swirled harmlesslyaround the edges of my shield. 　　And then I knew that I could do this. Obviously, I would be the number-one priority, the first one to die,but as long as I held, we were on more than equal footing with the Volturi. We still had Benjamin andZafrina; they had no supernatural help at all. As long as I held. 　　Tm going to have to concentrate,\" I whispered to Edward. \"When it comes to hand to hand, it\u0027s going tobe harder to keep the shield around the right people.\"\"I\u0027ll keep them off you.\"\"No. You have to get to Demetri. Zafrina will keep them away from me.\"Zafrina nodded solemnly. \"No one will touch this young one,\" she promised Edward. 　　\"I\u0027d go after Jane and Alec myself, but I can do more good here.\"\"Jane\u0027s mine,\" Kate hissed. \"She needs a taste of her own medicine.\"\"And Alec owes me many lives, but I will settle for his,\" Vladimir growled from the other side. \"He\u0027smine.\"\"I just want Caius,\" Tanya said evenly. 　　The others started divvying up opponents, too, but they were quickly interrupted. 　　Aro, staring calmly at Alec\u0027s ineffective mist, finally spoke. 　　\"Before we vote,\" he began. 　　I shook my head angrily. I was tired of this charade. The bloodlust was igniting in me again, and I wassorry that I would help the others more by standing still. I wanted to fight. 　　\"Let me remind you,\" Aro continued, \"whatever the council\u0027s decision, there need be no violence here.\"Edward snarled out a dark laugh. 　　Aro stared at him sadly. \"It will be a regrettable waste to our kind to lose any of you. But you especially,young Edward, and your newborn mate. The Volturi would be glad to welcome many of you into ourranks. Bella, Benjamin, Zafrina, Kate. There are many choices before you. Consider them.\"Chelsea\u0027s attempt to sway us fluttered impotently against my shield. Aro\u0027s gaze swept across our hardeyes, looking for any indication of hesitation. From his expression, he found none. 　　I knew he was desperate to keep Edward and me, to imprison us the way he had hoped to enslaveAlice. But this fight was too big. He would not win if I lived. I was fiercely glad to be so powerful that Ileft him no way not to kill me. 　　\"Let us vote, then,\" he said with apparent reluctance. 　　Caius spoke with eager haste. \"The child is an unknown quantity. There is no reasonto allow sucha riskto exist. It must be destroyed, along with all who protect it.\" He smiled in expectation. 　　I fought back a shriek of defiance to answer his cruel smirk. 　　Marcus lifted his uncaring eyes, seeming to look through us as he voted. 　　\"I see no immediate danger. The child is safe enough for now. We can always reevaluate later. Let usleave in peace.\" His voice was even fainter than his brothers\u0027 feathery sighs. 　　None of the guard relaxed their ready positions at his disagreeing words. Caius\u0027s anticipatory grin didnot falter. It was as if Marcus hadn\u0027t spoken atall. 　　\"I must make the deciding vote, it seems,\" Aro mused. 　　Suddenly, Edward stiffened at my side. \"Yes!\" he hissed. 　　I risked a glance at him. His face glowed with an expression of triumph that I didn\u0027t understand—it wasthe expression an angel of destruction might wear while the world burned. Beautiful and terrifying. 　　There was a low reaction from the guard, an uneasy murmur. 　　\"Aro?\" Edward called, nearly shouted, undisguised victory in his voice. 　　Aro hesitated fora second, assessing this new mood warily before he answered. \"Yes, Edward? Youhave something further... ?\"\"Perhaps,\" Edward said pleasantly, controlling his unexplained excitement. \"First, if I could clarify onepoint?\"\"Certainly,\" Aro said, raising his eyebrows, nothing now but polite interest in his tone. My teeth groundtogether; Aro was never more dangerous than when he was gracious. 　　\"The danger you foresee from my daughter—this stems entirely from our inability to guess how she willdevelop? That is the crux of the matter?\"\"Yes, friend Edward,\" Aro agreed. \"If we could but be positive... be sure that, as she grows, she will beable to stay concealed from the human world—not endanger the safety of our obscurity ...\" He trailedoff, shrugging. 　　\"So, if we could only know for sure,\" Edward suggested, \"exactly what she will become... then therewould be no need for a council at all?\"\"If there was some way to be absolutely sure,\" Aro agreed, his feathery voice slightly more shrill. Hecouldn\u0027t see where Edward was leading him. Neither could I. \"Then, yes, there would be no question todebate.\"\"And we would part in peace, good friends once again?\" Edward asked with a hint of irony. 　　Even more shrill. \"Of course, my young friend. Nothing would please me more.\"Edward chuckled exultantly. \"Then I do have something more to offer.\"Aro\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"She is absolutely unique. Her future can only be guessed at.\"\"Not absolutely unique,\" Edward disagreed. \"Rare, certainly, but not one of a kind.\"I fought the shock, the sudden hope springing to life, as it threatened to distract me. The sickly-lookingmist still swirled around the edges of my shield. And, as I struggled to focus, I felt again the sharp,stabbing pressure againstmy protective hold. 　　\"Aro, would you ask Jane to stop attacking my wife?\" Edward asked courteously. \"We are stilldiscussing evidence.\"Aro raised one hand. \"Peace, dear ones. Let us hear him out.\"The pressure disappeared. Jane bared her teeth at me; I couldn\u0027t help grinning back at her. 　　\"Why don\u0027t you join us, Alice?\" Edward called loudly. 　　\"Alice,\" Esme whispered in shock. 　　Alice! 　　Alice, Alice, Alice! 　　\"Alice!\" \"Alice!\" other voices murmured around me. 　　\"Alice,\" Aro breathed. 　　Relief and violent joy surged through me. It took all my will to keep the shield where it was. Alec\u0027s miststill tested, seeking a weakness—Jane would see if I left any holes. 　　And then I heard them running through the forest, flying, closing the distance as quickly as they couldwith no slowing effort at silence. 　　Both sides were motionless in expectation. The Volturi witnesses scowled in fresh confusion. 　　Then Alice danced into the clearing from the southwest, and I felt like the bliss of seeing her face againmight knock me off my feet. Jasper was only inches behind her, his sharp eyes fierce. Close after themran three strangers; the first was a tall, muscular female with wild dark hair—obviously Kachiri. She hadthe same elongated limbs and features as the other Amazons, even more pronounced in her case. 　　The next was a small olive-toned female vampire with a long braid of black hair bobbing against herback. Her deep burgundy eyes flitted nervously around the confrontation before her. 　　And the last was a young man... not quite as fast nor quite as fluid in his run. His skin was an impossiblerich, dark brown. His wary eyes flashed across the gathering, and they were the color of warm teak. Hishair was black and braided, too, like the woman\u0027s, though not as long. He was beautiful. 　　As he neared us, a new sound sent shock waves through the watching crowd—the sound of anotherheartbeat, accelerated with exertion. 　　Alice leaped lightly over the edges of the dissipating mist that lapped at my shield and came to a sinuousstop at Edward\u0027s side. I reached out to touch her arm, and so did Edward, Esme, Carlisle. There wasn\u0027ttime for any other welcome. Jasper and the others followed her through the shield. 　　All the guard watched, speculation in their eyes, as the latecomers crossed the invisible border withoutdifficulty. The brawny ones, Felix and the others like him, focused their suddenly hopeful eyes on me. 　　They had not been sure of what my shield repelled, but it was clear now that it would not stop a physicalattack. As soon as Aro gave the order, the blitz would ensue, me the only object. I wondered how manyZafrina would be able to blind, and how much that would slow them. Long enough for Kate and Vladimirto take Jane and Alec out of the equation? That was all Icould ask for. 　　Edward, despite his absorption in the coup he was directing, stiffened furiously in response to theirthoughts. He controlled himself and spoke to Aro again. 　　\"Alice has been searching for her own witnesses these last weeks,\" he said to the ancient. \"And she doesnot come back empty-handed. Alice, why don\u0027t you introduce the witnesses you\u0027ve brought?\"Caius snarled. \"The time for witnesses is past! Cast your vote, Aro!\"Aro raised one finger to silence his brother, his eyes glued to Alice\u0027s face. 　　Alice stepped forward lightly and introduced the strangers. \"This is Huilen and her nephew, Nahuel.\"Hearing her voice... it was like she\u0027d never left. 　　Caius\u0027s eyes tightened as Alice named the relationship between the newcomers. The Volturi witnesseshissed amongst themselves. The vampire world was changing, and everyone could feel it. 　　\"Speak, Huilen,\" Aro commanded. \"Give us the witness you were brought to bear.\"The slight woman looked to Alice nervously. Alice nodded in encouragement, and Kachiri put her longhand on the little vampire\u0027s shoulder. 　　\"I am Huilen,\" the woman announced in clear but strangely accented English. As she continued, it wasapparent she had prepared herself to tell this story, that she had practiced. It flowed like a well-knownnursery rhyme. \"A century and a half ago, I lived with my people, the Mapuche. My sister was Pire. Ourparents named her after the snow on the mountains because of her fair skin. And she was very beautiful—too beautiful. She came to me one day in secret and told me of the angel that found her in the woods,that visited her by night. I warned her.\" Huilen shook her head mournfully. \"As if the bruises on her skinwere not warning enough. I knew it was the Libishomen of our legends, but she would not listen. Shewas bewitched. 　　\"She told me when she was sure her dark angel\u0027s child was growing inside her. I didn\u0027t try to discourageher from her plan to run away—I knew even our father and mother would agree that the child must bedestroyed, Pire with it. I went with her into the deepest parts of the forest. She searched for her demonangel but found nothing, i cared for her, hunted for her when her strength failed. She ate the animals raw,drinking their blood. I needed no more confirmation of what she carried in her womb. I hoped to saveher life before I killed the monster. 　　\"But she loved the child inside her. She called him Nahuel, after the jungle cat, when he grew strong andbroke her bones—and loved him still. 　　\"I could not save her. The child ripped his way free of her, and she died quickly, begging all the whilethat I would care for her Nahuel. Her dying wish—and I agreed. 　　\"He bit me, though, when I tried to lift him from her body. I crawled away into the jungle to die. I didn\u0027tget far—the pain was too much. But he found me; the newborn child struggled through the underbrush tomy side and waited for me. When the pain ended, he was curled against my side, sleeping. 　　\"I cared for him until he was able to hunt for himself. We hunted the villages around our forest, staying toourselves. We have never come so far from our home, but Nahuel wished to see the child here.\"Huilen bowed her head when she was finished and moved back so she was partially hidden behindKachiri. 　　Aro\u0027s lips were pursed. He stared at the dark-skinned youth. 　　\"Nahuel, you are one hundred and fifty years old?\" he questioned. 　　\"Give or take a decade,\" he answered in a clear, beautifully warm voice. His accent was barelynoticeable. \"We don\u0027t keep track.\"\"And you reached maturity at what age?\"\"About seven years after my birth, more or less, I was full grown.\"\"You have not changed since then?\"Nahuel shrugged. \"Not that I\u0027ve noticed.\"I felt a shudder tremble through Jacob\u0027s body. I didn\u0027t want to think about this yet. I would wait till thedanger was past and I could concentrate. 　　\"And your diet?\" Aro pressed, seeming interested in spite of himself. 　　\"Mostly blood, but some human food, too. I can survive on either.\"\"You were able to create an immortal?\" As Aro gestured to Huilen, his voice was abruptly intense. Irefocused on my shield; perhaps he was seeking a new excuse. 　　\"Yes, but none of the rest can.\"A shocked murmur ran through all three groups. 　　Aro\u0027s eyebrows shot up. \"The rest?\"\"My sisters.\" Nahuel shrugged again. 　　Aro stared wildly for a moment before composing his face. 　　\"Perhaps you would tell us the rest of your story, for there seems to be more.\"Nahuel frowned. 　　\"My father came looking for me a few years after my mother\u0027s death.\" His handsome face distortedslightly. \"He was pleased to find me.\" Nahuel\u0027s tone suggested the feeling was not mutual. \"He had twodaughters, but no sons. He expected me to join him, as my sisters had. 　　\"He was surprised I was not alone. My sisters are not venomous, but whether that\u0027s due to gender or arandom chance... who knows? I already had my family with Huilen, and I was not interested*—hetwisted the word—\"in making a change. I see him from time to time. I have a new sister; she reachedmaturity about ten years back.\"\"Your father\u0027s name?\" Caius asked through gritted teeth. 　　\"Joham,\" Nahuel answered. \"He considers himself a scientist. He thinks he\u0027s creating a new super-race.\"He made no attempt to disguise the disgust in his tone. 　　Caius looked at me. \"Your daughter, is she venomous?\" he demanded harshly. 　　\"No,\" I responded. Nahuel\u0027s head snapped up at Aro\u0027s question, and his teak eyes turned to bore intomy face. 　　Caius looked to Aro for confirmation, but Aro was absorbed in his own thoughts. He pursed his lips andstared at Carlisle, and then Edward, and at last his eyes rested on me. 　　Caius growled. \"We take care of the aberration here, and then follow it south,\" he urged Aro. 　　Aro stared into my eyes for a long, tense moment. I had no idea what he was searching for, or what hefound, but after he had measured me for that moment, something in his face changed, a faint shift in theset of his mouth and eyes, and I knew that Aro had made his decision. 　　\"Brother,\" he said softly to Caius. \"There appears to be no danger. This is an unusual development, but Isee no threat. These half-vampire children are much like us, it appears.\"\"Is that your vote?\" Caius demanded. 　　\"It is.\"Caius scowled. \"And this Joham? This immortal so fond of experimentation?\"\"Perhaps we should speak with him,\" Aro agreed. 　　\"Stop Joham if you will,\" Nahuel said flatly. \"But leave my sisters be. They are innocent.\"Aro nodded, his expression solemn. And then he turned back to his guard with a warm smile. 　　\"Dear ones,\" he called. \"We do not fight today.\"The guard nodded in unison and straightened out of their ready positions. The mist dissipated swiftly, butI held my shield in place. Maybe this was another trick. 　　I analyzed their expressions as Aro turned back to us. His face was as benign as ever, but unlike before,I sensed a strange blankness behind the fagade. As if his scheming was over. Caius was clearly incensed,but his rage was turned inward now; he was resigned. Marcus looked... bored; there really was no otherword for it. The guard was impassive and disciplined again; there were no individuals among them, justthe whole. They were in formation, ready to depart. The Volturi witnesses were still wary; one afteranother, they departed, scattering into the woods. As their numbers dwindled, the remaining sped up. 　　Soon they were all gone. 　　Aro held his hands out to us, almost apologetic. Behind him, the larger part of the guard, along withCaius, Marcus, and the silent, mysterious wives, were already drifting quickly away, their formationprecise once again. Only the three that seemed to be his personal guardians lingered with him. 　　\"I\u0027m so glad this could be resolved without violence,\" he said sweetly. \"My friend, Carlisle—howpleased I am to call you friend again! I hope there are no hard feelings. I know you understand the strictburden that our duty places on our shoulders.\"\"Leave in peace, Aro,\" Carlisle said stiffly. \"Please remember that we still have our anonymity to protecthere, and keep your guard from hunting in this region.\"\"Of course, Carlisle,\" Aro assured him. \"I am sorry to earn your disapproval, my dear friend. Perhaps, intime, you will forgive me.\"\"Perhaps, in time, if you prove a friend to us again.\"Aro bowed his head, the picture of remorse, and drifted backward for a moment before he turnedaround. We watched in silence as the last four Volturi disappeared into the trees. 　　It was very quiet. I did not drop my shield. 　　\"Is it really over?\" I whispered to Edward. 　　His smile was huge. \"Yes. They\u0027ve given up. Like all bullies, they\u0027re cowards underneath theswagger.\u00277He chuckled. 　　Alice laughed with him. \"Seriously, people. They\u0027re not coming back. Everybody can relax now.\"There was another beat of silence. 　　\"Of all the rotten luck,\" Stefan muttered. 　　And then it hit. 　　Cheers erupted. Deafening howls filled the clearing. Maggie pounded Siobhan on the back. Rosalie andEmmett kissed again—longer and more ardently than before. Benjamin and Tia were locked in eachother\u0027s arms, as were Carmen and Eleazar. Esme held Alice and Jasper in a tight embrace. Carlisle waswarmly thanking the South American newcomers who had saved us all. Kachin stood very close toZafrina and Senna, their fingertips interlocked. Garrett picked Kate up off the ground and swung heraround in a circle. 　　Stefan spit on the snow. Vladimir ground his teeth together with a sour expression. 　　And I half-climbed the giant russet wolf to rip my daughter off his back and then crushed her to mychest. Edward\u0027s arms were around us in the same second. 　　\"Nessie, Nessie, Nessie,\" I crooned. 　　Jacob laughed his big, barky laugh and poked the back of my head with his nose. 　　\"Shut up,\" I mumbled. 　　\"I get to stay with you?\" Nessie demanded. 　　\"Forever,\" I promised her. 　　We had forever. And Nessie was going to be fine and healthy and strong. Like the half-human Nahuel,in a hundred and fifty years she would still be young. And we would all be together. 　　Happiness expanded like an explosion inside me—so extreme, so violent that I wasn\u0027t sure I\u0027d survive it. 　　\"Forever,\" Edward echoed in my ear. 　　I couldn\u0027t speak anymore. I lifted my head and kissed him with a passion that might possibly set theforest on fire. 　　I wouldn\u0027t have noticed.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/151/6005.html","bookId":740,"book":{"id":740,"title":"暮光之城：破晓 Breaking Dawn","description":"简介： Bella and Edward are married, but their honeymoon is cut short when Bella discovers that she is pregnant.
