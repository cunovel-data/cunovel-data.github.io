{"id":26270,"no":31,"title":"Chapter 34 Declared","content":"I heard the music before I was out of the car. Edward hadn\u0027t touched his piano since the night Alice left. 　　Now, as I shut the car door, I heard the song morph through a bridge and change into my lullaby. 　　Edward was welcoming me home. 　　I moved slowly as I pulled Renesmee—fast asleep; we\u0027d been gone all day—from the car. We\u0027d leftJacob at Charlie\u0027s—he\u0027d said he was going to catch a ride home with Sue. I wondered if he was trying tofill his head with enough trivia to crowd out the image of the way my face had looked when I\u0027d walkedthrough Charlie\u0027s door. 　　As I walked slowly to the Cullen house now, I recognized that the hope and uplift that seemed almost avisible aura around the big white house had been mine this morning, too. It felt alien to me now. 　　I wanted to cry again, hearing Edward play for me. But I pulled it together. I didn\u0027t want him to besuspicious. I would leave no clues in his mind for Aro if I could help it. 　　Edward turned his head and smiled when I came in the door, but kept playing. 　　\"Welcome home,\" he said, as if this was just any normal day. As if there weren\u0027t twelve other vampiresin the room involved in various pursuits, and a dozen more scattered around somewhere. \"Did you have agood time with Charlie today?\"\"Yes. Sorry I was gone so long. I stepped out to do a little Christmas shopping for Renesmee. I know itwon\u0027t be much of an event, but...\" I shrugged. 　　Edward\u0027s lips turned down. He quit playing and spun around on the bench so that his whole body wasfacing me. He put one hand on my waist and pulled me closer. \"I hadn\u0027t thought much about it. If youwant to make an event of it—\"\"No,\" I interrupted him. I flinched internally at the idea of trying to fake more enthusiasm than the bareminimum. \"I just didn\u0027t want to let it pass without giving her something.\"\"Do I get to see?\"\"If you want. It\u0027s only a little thing.\"Renesmee was completely unconscious, snoring delicately against my neck. I envied her. It would havebeen nice to escape reality, even for just a few hours. 　　Carefully, I fished the little velvet jewelry bag from my clutch without opening the purse enough forEdward to see the cash I was still carrying. 　　\"It caught my eye from the window of an antique store while I was driving by.\"I shook the little golden locket into his palm. It was round with a slender vine border carved around theoutside edge of the circle. Edward popped the tiny catch and looked inside. There was space for a smallpicture and, on the opposite side, an inscription in French. 　　\"Do you know what this says?\" he asked in a different tone, more subdued than before. 　　\"The shopkeeper told me it said something along the lines of \u0027more than my own life.\u0027 Is that right?\"\"Yes, he had it right.\"He looked up at me, his topaz eyes probing. I met his gaze for a moment, then pretended to bedistracted by the television. 　　\"I hope she likes it,\" I muttered. 　　\"Of course she will,\" he said lightly, casually, and I was sure in that second that he knew I was keepingsomething from him. I was also sure that he had no idea of the specifics. 　　\"Let\u0027s take her home,\" he suggested, standing and putting his arm around my shoulders. 　　I hesitated. 　　\"What?\" he demanded. 　　\"I wanted to practice with Emmett a little___\" I\u0027d lost the whole day to my vital errand; it made me feelbehind. 　　Emmett—on the sofa with Rose and holding the remote, of course—looked up and grinned inanticipation. \"Excellent. The forest needs thinning.\"Edward frowned at Emmett and then at me. 　　\"There\u0027s plenty of time for that tomorrow,\" he said. 　　\"Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\" I complained. \"There\u0027s no such thing as plenty of time anymore. That conceptdoes not exist. I have a lot to learn and—\"He cut me off. \"Tomorrow.\"And his expression was such that not even Emmett argued. 　　i was surprised at how hard it was to go back to a routine that was, after all, brand new. But strippingaway even that little bit of hope I\u0027d been fostering made everything seem impossible. 　　I tried to focus on the positives. There was a good chance that my daughter was going to survive whatwascoming, and Jacob, too. If they had a future, then that was a kind of victory, wasn\u0027t it? Our little bandmust be going to hold their own if Jacob and Renesmee were going to have the opportunity to run in thefirst place. Yes, Alice\u0027s strategy only made sense if we were going to put up a really good fight. So, akind of victory there, too, considering that the Volturi had never been seriously challenged in millennia. 　　It was not going to be the end of the world. Just the end of the Cullens. The end of Edward, the end ofme. 　　I preferred it that way—the last part anyway. I would not live without Edward again; if he was leavingthis world, then I would be right behind him. 　　I wondered idly now and then if there would be anything for us on the other side. I knew Edward didn\u0027treally believe so, but Carlisle did. I couldn\u0027t imagine it myself. On the other hand, I couldn\u0027t imagineEdward not existing somehow, somewhere. If we could be together in any place, then that was a happyending. 　　And so the pattern of my days continued, just that much harder than before. 　　We went to see Charlie on Christmas Day, Edward, Renesmee, Jacob, and I. All of Jacob\u0027s pack werethere, plus Sam, Emily, and Sue. It was a big help to have them there in Charlie\u0027s little rooms, their huge,warm bodies wedged into corners around his sparsely decorated tree—you could see exactly where he\u0027dgotten bored and quit—and overflowing his furniture. You could always count on werewolves to bebuzzed about a coming fight, no matter how suicidal. The electricity of their excitement provided a nicecurrent that disguised my utter lack of spirit. Edward was, as always, a better actor than I was. 　　Renesmee wore the locket I\u0027d given her at dawn, and in her jacket pocket was the MP3 player Edwardhad given her—a tiny thing that held five thousand songs, already filled with Edward\u0027s favorites. On herwrist was an intricately braided Quileute version of a promise ring. Edward had gritted his teeth over thatone, but it didn\u0027t bother me. 　　Soon, so soon, I would be giving her to Jacob for safekeeping. How could I be bothered by any symbolof the commitment I was so relying on? 　　Edward had saved the day by ordering a gift for Charlie, too. It had shown up yesterday—priorityovernight shipping—and Charlie spent all morning reading the thick instruction manual to his new fishingsonar system. 　　From the way the werewolves ate, Sue\u0027s lunch spread must have been good. I wondered how thegathering would have looked to an outsider. Did we play our parts well enough? Would a stranger havethought us a happy circle of friends, enjoying the holiday with casual cheer? 　　I think Edward and Jacob both were as relieved as I was when it was time to go. It felt odd to spendenergy on the human fagade when there were so many more important things to be doing. I had a hardtime concentrating. At the same time, this was perhaps the last time I would see Charlie. Maybe it was agood thing that I was too numb to really register that. 　　I hadn\u0027t seen my mother since the wedding, but I found I could only be glad for the gradual distancingthat had begun two years ago. She was too fragile for my world. I didn\u0027t want her to have any part ofthis. Charlie was stronger. 　　Maybe even strong enough for a goodbye now, but I wasn\u0027t. 　　It was very quiet in the car; outside, the rain was just a mist, hovering on the edge between liquid andice. Renesmee sat on my lap, playing with her locket, opening and closing it. I watched her and imaginedthe things I would say to Jacob right now if I didn\u0027t have to keep my words out of Edward\u0027s head. 　　If its ever safe again, take her to Charlie. Tell him the whole story someday. Tell him how much I lovedhim, how I couldn\u0027t bear to leave him even when my human life was over. Tell him he was the best father. 　　Tell him to pass my love on to Renee, all my hopes that she will be happy and well.... 　　I would have to give Jacob the documents before it was too late. I would give him a note for Charlie,too. And a letter for Renesmee. Something for her to read when I couldn\u0027t tell her I loved her anymore. 　　There was nothing unusual about the outside of the Cullen house as we pulled into the meadow, but Icould hear some kind of subtle uproar inside. Many low voices murmured and growled. It soundedintense, and it sounded like an argument. I could pick out Carlisle\u0027s voice and Amun\u0027s more often than theothers. 　　Edward parked in front of the house rather than going around to the garage. We exchanged one waryglance before we got out of the car. 　　Jacob\u0027s stance changed; his face turned serious and careful. I guessed that he was in Alpha mode now. 　　Obviously, something had happened, and he was going to get the information he and Sam would need. 　　\"Alistair is gone,\" Edward murmured as we darted up the steps. 　　Inside the front room, the main confrontation was physically apparent. Lining the walls was a ring ofspectators, every vampire who had joined us, except for Alistair and the three involved in the quarrel. 　　Esme, Kebi, and Tia were the closest to the three vampires in the center; in the middle of the room,Amun was hissing at Carlisle and Benjamin. 　　Edward\u0027s jaw tightened and he moved quickly to Esme\u0027s side, towing me by the hand. I clutchedRenesmee tightly to my chest. 　　\"Amun, if you want to go, no one is forcing you to stay,\" Carlisle said calmly. 　　\"You\u0027re stealing half my coven, Carlisle!\" Amun shrieked, stabbing one finger at Benjamin. \"Is that whyyou called me here? To steal from me?\"Carlisle sighed, and Benjamin rolled his eyes. 　　\"Yes, Carlisle picked a fight with the Volturi, endangered his whole family, just to lure me here to mydeath,\" Benjamin said sarcastically. \"Be reasonable, Amun. I\u0027m committed to do the right thing here—I\u0027mnot joining any other coven. You can do whatever you want, of course, as Carlisle has pointed out.\"\"This won\u0027t end well,\" Amun growled. \"Alistair was the only sane one here. We should all be running.\"\"Think of who you\u0027re calling sane,\" Tia murmured in a quiet aside. 　　\"We\u0027re all going to be slaughtered!\"\"It\u0027s not going to come to a fight,\" Carlisle said in a firm voice. 　　\"You say!\"\"If it does, you can always switch sides, Amun. I\u0027m sure the Volturi will appreciate your help.\"Amun sneered at him. \"Perhaps that is the answer.\"Carlisle\u0027s answer was soft and sincere. \"I wouldn\u0027t hold that against you, Amun. We have been friendsfor a long time, but I would never ask you to die for me.\"Amun\u0027s voice was more controlled, too. \"But you\u0027re taking my Benjamin down with you.\"Carlisle put his hand on Amun\u0027s shoulder; Amun shook it off. 　　\"I\u0027ll stay, Carlisle, but it might be to your detriment. I will join them if that\u0027s the road to survival. You\u0027reall fools to think that you can defy the Volturi.\" He scowled, then sighed, glanced at Renesmee and me,and added in an exasperated tone, \"I will witness that the child has grown. That\u0027s nothing but the truth. 　　Anyone would see that.\"\"That\u0027s all we\u0027ve ever asked.\"Amun grimaced, \"But not all that you are getting, it seems.\" He turned on Benjamin. \"I gave you life. 　　You\u0027re wasting it.\"Benjamin\u0027s face looked colder than I\u0027d ever seen it; the expression contrasted oddly with his boyishfeatures. \"It\u0027s a pity you couldn\u0027t replace my will with your own in the process; perhaps then you wouldhave been satisfied with me.\"Amun\u0027s eyes narrowed. He gestured abruptly to Kebi, and they stalked past us out the front door. 　　\"He\u0027s not leaving,\" Edward said quietly to me, \"but he\u0027ll be keeping his distance even more from now on. 　　He wasn\u0027t bluffing when he spoke of joining the Volturi.\"\"Why did Alistair go?\" I whispered. 　　\"No one can be positive; he didn\u0027t leave a note. From his mutters, it\u0027s been clear that he thinks a fight isinevitable. Despite his demeanor, he actually does care too much for Carlisle to stand with the Volturi. Isuppose he decided the danger was too much.\" Edward shrugged. 　　Though our conversation was clearly just between the two of us, of course everyone could hear it. 　　Eleazar answered Edward\u0027s comment like it had been meant for all. 　　\"From the sound of his mumblings, it was a bit more than that. We haven\u0027t spoken much of the Volturiagenda, but Alistair worried that no matter how decisively we can prove your innocence, the Volturi willnot listen. He thinks they will find an excuse to achieve their goals here.\"The vampires glanced uneasily at one another. The idea that the Volturi would manipulate their ownsacrosanct law for gain was not a popular idea. Only the Romanians were composed, their smallhalf-smiles ironic. They seemed amused at how the others wanted to think well of their ancient enemies. 　　Many low discussions began at the same time, but it was the Romanians I listened to. Maybe becausethe fair-haired Vladimir kept shooting glances in my direction. 　　\"I do so hope Alistair was right about this,\" Stefan murmured to Vladimir. \"No matter the outcome,word will spread. It\u0027s time our world saw the Volturi for what they\u0027ve become. They\u0027ll never fall ifeveryone believes this nonsense about them protecting our way of life.\"\"At least when we ruled, we were honest about what we were,\" Vladimir replied. 　　Stefan nodded. \"We never put on white hats and called ourselves saints.\"Tm thinking the time has come to fight,\" Vladimir said. \"How can you imagine well ever find a betterforce to stand with? Another chance this good?\"\"Nothing is impossible. Maybe someday—\"\"We\u0027ve been waiting for fifteen hundred years, Stefan. And they\u0027ve only gotten stronger with theyears.\" Vladimir paused and looked at me again. He showed no surprise when he saw that I waswatching him, too. \"If the Volturi win this conflict, they will leave with more power than they came with. 　　With every conquest they add to their strengths. Think of what that newborn alone could give them\"—hejerked his chin toward me—\"and she is barely discovering her gifts. And the earth-mover.\" Vladimirnodded toward Benjamin, who stiffened. Almost everyone was eavesdropping on the Romanians now,like me. \"With their witch twins they have no need of the illusionist or the fire touch.\" His eyes moved toZafrina, then Kate. 　　Stefan looked at Edward. \"Nor is the mind reader is exactly necessary. But I see your point. Indeed,they will gain much if they win.\"\"More than we can afford to have them gain, wouldn\u0027t you agree?\"Stefan sighed. \"I think i must agree. And that means...\"\"That we must stand against them while there is still hope.\"\"If we can just cripple them, even, expose them ...\"\"Then, someday, others will finish the job.\"\"And our long vendetta will be repaid. At last.\"They locked eyes for a moment and then murmured in unison. \"It seems the only way.\"\"So we fight,\" Stefan said. 　　Though I could see that they were torn, self-preservation warring with revenge, the smile they exchangedwas full of anticipation. 　　\"We fight,\" Vladimir agreed. 　　I suppose it was a good thing; like Alistair, I was sure the battle was impossible to avoid. In that case,two more vampires fighting on our side could only help. But the Romanians\u0027 decision still made meshudder. 　　\"We will fight, too,\" Tia said, her usually grave voice more solemn than ever. \"We believe the Volturi willoverstep their authority. We have no wish to belong to them.\" Her eyes lingered on her mate. 　　Benjamin grinned and threw an impish glance toward the Romanians. \"Apparently, I\u0027m a hot commodity. 　　It appears I have to win the right to be free.\"\"This won\u0027t be the first time I\u0027ve fought to keep myself from a king\u0027s rule,\" Garrett said in a teasing tone. 　　He walked over and clapped Benjamin on the back. \"Here\u0027s to freedom from oppression.\"\"We stand with Carlisle,\" Tanya said. \"And we fight with him.\"The Romanians\u0027 pronouncement seemed to have made the others feel the need to declare themselves aswell. 　　\"We have not decided/7Peter said. He looked down at his tiny companion; Charlotte\u0027s lips were set indissatisfaction. It looked like she\u0027d made her decision. I wondered what it was. 　　\"The same goes for me,\" Randall said. 　　\"And me,\" Mary added. 　　\"The packs will fight with the Cullens,\" Jacob said suddenly. \"We\u0027re not afraid of vampires,\" he addedwith a smirk. 　　\"Children,\" Peter muttered. 　　\"Infants,\" Randall corrected. 　　Jacob grinned tauntingly. 　　\"Well, I\u0027m in, too,\" Maggie said, shrugging out from under Siobhan\u0027s restraining hand. \"I know truth is onCarlisle\u0027s side. I can\u0027t ignore that.\"Siobhan stared at the junior member of her coven with worried eyes. \"Carlisle,\" she said as if they werealone, ignoring the suddenly formal feel of the gathering, the unexpected outburst of declarations, \"I don\u0027twant this to come to a fight.\"\"Nor do I, Siobhan. You know that\u0027s the last thing I want.\" He half-smiled. \"Perhaps you shouldconcentrate on keeping it peaceful.\"\"You know that won\u0027t help,\" she said. 　　I remembered Rose and Carlisle\u0027s discussion of the Irish leader; Carlisle believed that Siobhan had somesubtle but powerful gift to make things go her way—and yet Siobhan didn\u0027t believe it herself. 　　\"It couldn\u0027t hurt,\" Carlisle said. 　　Siobhan rolled her eyes. \"Shall I visualize the outcome I desire?\" she asked sarcastically. 　　Carlisle was openly grinning now. \"If you don\u0027t mind.\"\"Then there is no need for my coven to declare itself, is there?\" she retorted. \"Since there is no possibilityof a fight.\" She put her hand back on Maggie\u0027s shoulder, pulling the girl closer to her. Siobhan\u0027s mate,Liam, stood silent and expressionless. 　　Almost everyone else in the room looked mystified by Carlisle and Siobhan\u0027s clearly joking exchange,but they didn\u0027t explain themselves. 　　That was the end of the dramatic speeches for the night. The group slowly dispersed, some off to hunt,some to while away the time with Carlisle\u0027s books or televisions or computers. 　　Edward, Renesmee, and I went to hunt. Jacob tagged along. 　　\"Stupid leeches,\" he muttered to himself when we got outside. \"Think they\u0027re so superior.\" He snorted. 　　\"They\u0027ll be shocked when the infants save their superior lives, won\u0027t they?\" Edward said. 　　Jake smiled and punched his shoulder. \"Hell yeah, they will.\"This wasn\u0027t our last hunting trip. We all would hunt again nearer to the time we expected the Volturi. Asthe deadline was not exact, we were planning to stay a few nights out in the big baseball clearing Alicehad seen, just incase. All we knew was that they would come the day that the snow stuck to the ground. We didn\u0027t wantthe Volturi too close to town, and Demetri would lead them to wherever we were. I wondered who hewould track in, and guessed that it would be Edward since he couldn\u0027t track me. 　　I thought about Demetri while I hunted, paying little attention to my prey or the drifting snowflakes thathad finally appeared but were melting before they touched the rocky soil. Would Demetri realize that hecouldn\u0027t track me? What would he make of that? What would Aro? Or was Edward wrong? There werethose little exceptions to what I could withstand, those ways around my shield. Everything that wasoutside my mind was vulnerable—open to the things Jasper, Alice, and Benjamin could do. MaybeDemetri\u0027s talent worked a little differently, too. 　　And then I had a thought that brought me up short. The half-drained elk dropped from my hands to thestony ground. Snowflakes vaporized a few inches from the warm body with tiny sizzling sounds. I staredblankly at my bloody hands. 　　Edward saw my reaction and hurried to my side, leaving his own kill undrained. 　　\"What\u0027s wrong?\" he asked in a low voice, his eyes sweeping the forest around us, looking for whateverhad triggered my behavior. 　　\"Renesmee,\" I choked. 　　\"She\u0027s just through those trees,\" he reassured me. \"I can hear both her thoughts and Jacob\u0027s. She\u0027s fine.\"\"That\u0027s not what I meant,\" I said. \"I was thinking about my shield—you really think it\u0027s worth something,that it will help somehow. I know the others are hoping that I\u0027ll be able to shield Zafrina and Benjamin,even if I can only keep it up for a few seconds at a time. What if that\u0027s a mistake? What if your trust inme is the reason that we fail?\"My voice was edging toward hysteria, though I had enough control to keep it low. I didn\u0027t want to upsetRenesmee. 　　\"Bella, what brought this on? Of course, it s wonderful that you can protect yourself, but you\u0027re notresponsible for saving anyone. Don\u0027t distress yourself needlessly.\"\"But what if I can\u0027t protect anything?\" I whispered in gasps. \"This thing I do, it\u0027s faulty, it\u0027s erratic! 　　There\u0027s no rhyme or reason to it. Maybe it will do nothing against Alec at all.\"\"Shh,\" he hushed me. \"Don\u0027t panic. And don\u0027t worry about Alec. What he does is no different than whatJane or Zafrina does. It\u0027s just an illusion—he can\u0027t get inside your head any more than I can.\"\"But Renesmee does!\" I hissed frantically through my teeth. \"It seemed so natural, I never questioned itbefore. It\u0027s always been just part of who she is. But she puts her thoughts right into my head just like shedoes with everyone else. My shield has holes, Edward!\"I stared at him desperately, waiting for him to acknowledge my terrible revelation. His lips were pursed,as if he was trying to decide how to phrase something. His expression was perfectly relaxed. 　　\"You thought of this a long time ago, didn\u0027t you?\" I demanded, feeling like an idiot for my months ofoverlooking the obvious. 　　He nodded, a faint smile pulling up one corner of his mouth. \"The first time she touched you.\"I sighed at my own stupidity, but his calm had mellowed me some. \"And this doesn\u0027t bother you? Youdon\u0027t see it as a problem?\"\"I have two theories, one more likely than the other.\"\"Give me the least likely first.\"\"Well, she\u0027s your daughter,\" he pointed out. \"Genetically half you. I used to tease you about how yourmind was on a different frequency than the rest of ours. Perhaps she runs on the same.\"This didn\u0027t work for me. \"But you hear her mind just fine. Everyone hears her mind. And what if Alecruns on a different frequency? What if—?\"He put a finger to my lips. \"I\u0027ve considered that. Which is why I think this next theory is much morelikely.\"I gritted my teeth and waited. 　　\"Do you remember what Carlisle said to me about her, right after she showed you that first memory?\"Of course I remembered. \"He said, It\u0027s an interesting twist. Like she\u0027s doing the exact opposite of whatyou can.\u0027\"\"Yes. And so I wondered. Maybe she took your talent and flipped it, too.\"I considered that. 　　\"You keep everyone out,\" he began. 　　\"And no one keeps her out?\" I finished hesitantly. 　　\"That\u0027s my theory,\" he said. \"And if she can get into your head, I doubt there\u0027s a shield on the planet whocould keep her at bay. That will help. From what we\u0027ve seen, no one can doubt the truth of her thoughtsonce they\u0027ve allowed her to show them. And I think no one can keep her from showing them, if she getsclose enough. If Aro allows her to explain___\"I shuddered to think of Renesmee so close to Aro\u0027s greedy, milky eyes. 　　\"Well,\" he said, rubbing my tight shoulders. \"At least there\u0027s nothing that can stop him from seeing thetruth.\"\"But is the truth enough to stop him?\" I murmured. 　　For that, Edward had no answer.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/151/6001.html","bookId":740,"book":{"id":740,"title":"暮光之城：破晓 Breaking Dawn","description":"简介： Bella and Edward are married, but their honeymoon is cut short when Bella discovers that she is pregnant.
