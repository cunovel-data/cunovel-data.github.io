Fate smiles on her when she runs into her former classmate and current cowboy hottie Tell McKay.

But he is no longer that easily manipulated boy these days he\u0027s earned a reputation with the ladies that lives up to the McKay last name. He agrees to escort her to the reunion with one stipulation; that Georgia proves she has left behind the goody-goody cheerleader of the past by sharing his bed.
