Tell remembered how easily she charmed, tempted and cajoled him into doing whatever she wanted. But he wasn’t going to make this easy on her. He leaned forward and murmured, “Just this once has been ten times over the course of the year.” Her haughty look was hot as hell. “I didn’t realize you were keeping track.” Tell shrugged. “I just think it’s time I got something in return for helpin’ you out.” “What do you want?” “What do you think I want?” he countered. Georgia trailed her fingertips across his rough knuckles. “I never noticed how large your hands are. I think you want to put these hands all over me.” He quickly wrapped his fingers around her wrist. “Wrong. I want a kiss. Not a peck on the mouth. A real kiss. With tongue and everything.” “Okay.” She bit her lip. “I can meet you after school.” Tell shook his head. “Right here, right now.” “Why can’t it wait?” “Because I know you. You’ll have second thoughts just like you did with the project. So if you want to copy my homework, you’ll let me taste my fill of them hot lips. Right now.” Desire flashed in her eyes. But she still played the game. “I don’t want to get busted for a PDA.” “The teacher ain’t here.” Tell brought her palm to his mouth and placed a kiss in the center. “And I don’t give a shit what anyone else says or thinks.” She finally sighed. “Fine. Pucker up. The bell is about to ring.” He laughed softly. “Not so fast.” “But—” “Come closer.” Georgia complied with just enough trepidation to make it believable. They met in the middle of his desk. The angle was a bit awkward, but this was how he’d imagined it. Her lips were so full and ripe he ached to take a bite. He skimmed his mouth over hers, catching the edges of her upper and lower lips with the soft, smooth inside of his. Letting the moist undersides cling together before following the contour with a painstakingly slow glide. Her breath came in short bursts, mingling with his measured exhalations. When he swept the tip of his tongue across the seam of her lips, she moaned, opening for him fully. Tell curled his hand around her neck, taking possession of her mouth. His tongue warred with hers; every swirling stroke kicked his need higher. Each suck, each lick, each slide of wet lips urged him to drag her out of the seat. Urged him to press and grind their bodies together. When she eased back, he focused his attention on the section of her throat where her pulse jumped. He could feel her body vibrating, and he realized the kiss had shaken her as much as it had him. “Georgia.” His teeth scraped her throat. “I want you.” “God. Yes. Don’t stop doing that.” As many times as he had imagined this scenario as a seventeen-year-old boy, he hadn’t choreographed the logistics. He didn’t want to bend her over. He wanted to look in her eyes as he slid home. The student desks were too small and unstable for what he had in mind. But the teacher’s desk was perfect. “Baby, we gotta move.” She attempted to smooth her hair back into place as she slid out from the desk. He laughed and hauled her close. “Your hair is gonna look a whole lot messier by the time I get done with you.” “Tell. I don’t know about this.” She squirmed out of his hold and started backing away from him. He stalked her. “You drive me outta my fuckin’ mind, Georgia Hotchkiss.” “Maybe we should sneak out and do it in your truck.” “Maybe you oughta get it through that pretty head of yours that I’m gonna have you. My way. Now.” Tell had let her retreat until she’d literally backed herself into a corner. He slapped his hands on the chalkboard beside her head. Just as he leaned closer, she snaked her arms around his neck, and stole the kiss from him. Her body movements were porn-star-worthy as she made those fucking needy little moans. He had years’ worth of fantasies revolving around him and Georgia alone in a classroom, but dragging this out wasn’t an option. “Are you wet for me?” he whispered. “Sopping wet,” she whispered back. “Who’da thought such a pretty mouth could be so dirty?” “Show me dirty.” She nuzzled his neck. “I’ve wanted you for so long. So, so long.” Her tongue zigzagged back up to his ear. “Fuck me, Tell McKay. Fuck me now. No one ever has to know.” A primitive growl was the only sound he could manage. He held on to her biceps as he pulled her away from the chalkboard and spun her toward the desk. He kicked the chair aside, releasing her only long enough to sweep all the papers off the surface, just like in that teenage fantasy. She emitted an eep of surprise as he picked her up and set her on the surface. Her heated gaze met his when he unbuckled his belt. “Pull that dress out of my way.” The fabric clung to her thighs as she inched the dress up to her hips. She twisted a finger in the elastic band of her silver thong. “You want me to take these off?” “Yes.” He watched with his damn tongue hanging out as she whisked that scrap of satin down her trembling legs, then fingered herself with a soft moan of delight. Then he was wedged between her thighs. Condom on, he lightly pushed her shoulders with a murmured, “Lie back.” Soon as she was, he slid into her. Easily. Fully. He slanted over her, taking her mouth the same way he took her body. With unrestrained passion. Georgia arched; her tits bounced into his chest with his every aggressive thrust. Everything spun into a vortex of pleasure: the tight clasp of her pussy, the sound of his flesh slapping hers, the taste of her mouth and the need building between them with every stroke. She broke the kiss first. “I need…more.” Curling his hands around the steep angle of her high heels, he brought her knees above her hips and spread her wider. Fucking her harder, deeper. “Like that?” “Yes. But I’m sliding around too much.” “Hold on to me.” She reached up, grabbing his biceps. “God, I fuckin’ love it when you dig your nails into me,” he panted. Gasping, she rocked her hips into his every thrust. “Look at you. So damn hot. So much better than any fantasy.” “Tell. Please. Make me come.” He repositioned his pelvis so he connected with her clit every time he plunged to the root. “So close. So…” A long moan flowed from her mouth as she unraveled. Completely. Her body arched and her face became lost in pleasure. He couldn’t tear his eyes away from Georgia, beautiful in abandoning herself to passion, to the moment, to him. Tell wasn’t far behind. He pumped into her three more times and he was done. His eyes rolled into the back of his head as her cunt clamped down and milked him dry. Holy fuck. He opened his eyes and saw Georgia was still as out of it as he was. He ditched the condom and had his pants buckled before she stirred. When he ran his hand up the inside of her thigh, she flinched. “You okay?” Georgia wore a dreamy smile as she stretched her arms above her head. “I feel like an ungrounded wire. In a good way.” “So I gathered.” Tell snuck another kiss. This one sweet and lazy. He rested his forehead on hers. “Thank you. That was amazing.” “Mmm-hmm. I’m still feeling a little dizzy. A shot of you is so heady.” Her fingertips outlined his face from his temples to his jawline. “I don’t want to go back in there.” “Just for a little while.” “I must look well fucked. You think anyone will suspect what we’ve been up to?” I hope so. She laughed. “You are so transparent, McKay. You want me waltzing into the gym with my hair a mess, my dress wrinkled, my grin ten miles wide.” “Busted.” He slipped on his sport coat and watched as she fussed with her dress and her hair. “Ready?” “I guess.” Georgia started toward the door. Staring at her backside, he muttered, “Shit. Wait a second.” “What?” “Ah. You have chalk marks on your ass.” “Seriously?” She tried to look over her shoulder at her butt. “Hang on. I’ll brush them off.” As he swatted, he noticed the perfect bounce in those round cheeks. He had a flash of spanking her ass until those cheeks were pink and hot. Usually he kept his fun-loving persona at the forefront when he took a woman to bed. But sometimes he’d wanted more. Not a longer connection but a more intimate one. He’d finally had the guts to show his intense side to Georgia and she liked his sexual demands. He wondered how far she’d let him take it. “So, are you about done smacking my ass, cowboy?” Tell pinned her back to his chest. “And if I say no?” He nuzzled her ear. “If I admitted my other fantasy was tyin’ you up and spanking your butt until you came, would you be willing to give it a go?” Her breath hitched. It took a few long seconds before she answered. “If I didn’t have to obsess about it beforehand. If we’re in a moment…” “And if I decided that’s what I wanted from you in that moment? You’d be okay with that?” “Yes.” He growled, “You’ve been a naughty girl, Miz Hotchkiss, getting fucked in the classroom. That behavior is against school policy and will result in a trip to the principal’s office for proper punishment.” She peered over her shoulder. “Principal McMasters kept a paddle in his office.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kissin-tell-rough-riders-13/page-28.html","bookId":2694,"book":{"id":2694,"title":"Kissin\u0027 Tell (Rough Riders #13)","description":"Storyline: Kissin\u0027 Tell (Rough Riders #13) She once led him around by a string.
