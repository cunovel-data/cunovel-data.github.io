And those pretty, perky nipples.\n “Beautiful.” He slid his hands up her back and around her rib cage to peel away the sides of the stiff material. His thumbs stroked the underswell of her breasts and the soft, plump sides. Each new stroke sent gooseflesh across her arms. Seeing her reaction caused his cock to jerk against his zipper.\n “Tell. Please. Touch me.”\n Since she asked so nice… “Remind me again about second base. ’Cause I never got to it in high school.”\n “You’re kidding me.”\n “Nope. I was a late bloomer, remember? So second base means I just get to touch? Or do I get to use my mouth?”\n “Uh. It can be whatever you want.”\n “Oh. I want all right.” Tell lowered his head and Georgia arched back slightly. He pursed his lips around the already hard nipple and sucked.\n She groaned and bit her lower lip.\n He delicately swirled his tongue around the crest of her nipple until she squirmed. Then he bit down with enough pressure to get her attention.\n “What the…” She shuddered when he did it again.\n Tell pulled her upright and pressed her against the hard planes of his chest. He brushed his lips over her ear, keeping his hand cupped around her breast trapped between them. “You like a little pain.”\n “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”\n “Liar.” He pinched her nipple and she quivered.\n “Tell—”\n “Do you like that? Yes or no?”\n “Yes, okay? Yes. Do it again.”\n Another pinch brought forth another moan from her.\n “You will be honest with me, Georgia. Even if you haven’t been honest with other men who’ve enjoyed your body. Maybe especially if that’s been the case.” He blew gently in her ear. “Make no mistake. I will enjoy the hell out of this body, and I can give you everything you’ve been afraid to ask for.”\n “God, you’re killing me. Please. More.”\n He growled and pushed her back. Squeezing her tits together so he could nip and suckle her nipples. Making her moan and thrash. The scent of her arousal teased his nose every time she rocked her hips forward. And damn if she wasn’t riding the sweet spot on his cock. And double damn if he didn’t just want to spin her around, yank her pants down and fuck her. Leaving suck marks over every inch of that beautiful skin. From beneath her strong, stubborn chin to the tips of these tasty nipples.\n Georgia moaned louder; her fingernails dug into his biceps as she pushed her nipple against his teeth.\n Fuck. She was hotter than fire. Tell sucked harder, switching between her left and right nipples. Licking. Biting. Devouring her until she released a long wail.\n A pair of male voices echoed to them. “Did you hear that?”\n “What? I don’t hear nothin’.”\n “That’s because you’re drunk. Them grunting and moaning sounds mean someone is getting fucked good.”\n “Let’s see if we can find ’em,” the drunken guy slurred. “I wanna watch live porn. See some big bouncing titties.”\n They both froze. Tell’s eyes met Georgia’s. He mouthed, “Sorry.”\n She wasn’t happy as she began to re-fasten the hooks with shaking hands. He didn’t offer to help; he just kept his hands on her lower back, holding her steady. The only thing that’d stopped him from fucking her right there on the tailgate of his truck was…well, they were on the tailgate, in the parking lot of a damn bar. He wanted so much more than bouncing in the bed of his truck the first time he made her come undone.\n Good timing, though, with the interruption from the peeping drunks. Tell had been seconds away from throwing common sense and caution into the wind, taking Georgia amidst the hay, dirt and tools in his truckbed. How fucking romantic would that have been?\n She tapped his shoulder to get his attention. “You can let go of me now.”\n “Sure.” Tell stood and set her back on her feet.\n She made a big show of straightening her clothes and a big point of not looking at him.\n “Georgia, I’m sorry—”\n “Me too.” Her gaze snapped to his. It wasn’t embarrassment in her eyes, but anger. Or frustration?\n He took a step forward only to have her take a step back.\n “Stay where you are, Tell McKay. I seem to lose all rational thought when you put your hands on me.”\n Tell couldn’t help but grin. “But, sweetness, that’s the way it’s supposed to be when I’m touchin’ you.”\n “Not in public. Again. Not when you have no intention of following through after getting me so worked up. Again. I’m such an idiot. Again.” Georgia took another step back. “Look, I have to go.”\n “But—”\n “Do you want to come back to my place so we can finish what you started?”\n When he didn’t immediately answer, she released a harsh laugh. “I didn’t think so.” She whirled around and set off at a good clip across the parking lot.\n He followed her.\n She stopped beside a black Honda with Texas plates. “I’ll see you.”\n “When?” he demanded.\n “Not tomorrow. I can’t…I have something else going on.”\n Why did he get the feeling she was lying? “Fine. Thursday night. I’ll pick you up. We’ll go out for a nice supper.”\n “Tell, I don’t think—”\n He closed the distance between them. “I will be at your place at seven on Thursday night.”\n “All right.”\n “And you are gonna give me a goodnight kiss.”\n “Why don’t you just take one?” she taunted.\n “Great idea.” He clamped one hand on her ass and grabbed a fistful of her hair, angling her exactly where he wanted as he plundered her mouth.\n They’d shared some hot kisses over the last three days, but nothing like this. This kiss was a primal preview of every raunchy, dirty, kinky thing he planned to do to her. At least three times.\n Maybe he felt a little smug that Georgia whined a protest when he broke the kiss. Maybe he felt a little cocky, seeing the dazed look of need that had heated her pale irises to a deeper blue.\n “Drive safe.”\n Chapter Eight\n Trying to do twelve things at once, she let the phone ring six times before she brusquely answered, “This is Georgia Hotchkiss.”\n “Georgia. I had to hear from Smitty that you got a job in Wyoming?”\n She’d wondered how long before the news reached her father. “It’s been what? Four months since we’ve talked?”\n “I’m calling you now. How long are you in Sundance?”\n Why wouldn’t he assume her job was permanent? “The event promotion company I work for has taken over the summer rodeo events for our latest acquisition. I’m here to ensure it all runs smoothly.” She’d keep the conversation short. “Was there something you needed?”\n “I can’t even call my own daughter? You’re too good to talk to your dad now?”\n Georgia paced. “I’m not going to fight with you. I doubt you would’ve called me if Smitty hadn’t mentioned he’d seen me at Ziggy’s on Tuesday night, right?”\n A pause. “Fine, I’ll admit Smitty called me.”\n “I didn’t realize you and Smitty were so close.”\n “We ain’t. He’s still good friends with Deck. He wondered if Deck would be upset when he heard you were back.”\n “Why would Deck be upset about anything that had to do with me? We’ve been divorced for seven years.”\n “You left him, Georgie. A man don’t take that well, no matter how long it’s been. No reason to rub it in.”\n She hated that he’d called her Georgie. Like a boy. Like the boy he wished she were. “The reason I left him was because I caught him in bed with Tara-Lee.”\n Her father harrumphed. “All men make mistakes.”\n “That was the proverbial straw for me, and his mistake cost him, didn’t it?”\n “Ain’t nothin’ as cut and dried as it looks. Anyway, I’m asking if you’re going to your high school class reunion next weekend.”\n “Why didn’t Deck call me himself and ask?”\n “Because Tara-Lee would get upset. Not good for a woman in her condition.”\n “Terminally stupid is a condition now?” Wow. Had that bitchy comment just come out of her?\n “Such a mean mouth. Just like your mama.”\n Georgia rolled her eyes. Her mom had a mouth so sweet honeybees swarmed around it. “Yes, I’m going to the reunion. With Tell McKay.”\n “Why him, Georgie? That’s gonna cause a big ruckus.”\n “Deck and me being in the same room will cause a lot of speculation anyway. I don’t owe my ex-husband anything, least of all any type of consideration for everything that man has…” Taken from me.\n “You remember your actions reflect on you, not on him.”\n “I’m thrilled to hear that Deck is still golden in your eyes and he’s become the son you lost.”\n “Now wait just a damn minute, Georgia Lou, that’s not—”\n “Sorry, Dad, you’ll have to excuse me, I have a business call coming in on the other line.” She hung up on him.\n Beyond angry, she paced, hands clenched at her sides.\n Even when her father finally deigned to call her, it hadn’t been to see how things were going in her life. No, it was to poke at her.\n Why are you surprised?\n Needing to get out of her head, she cranked up her iPod and stormed outside.\n She’d rented this small, two-story house because it had a great backyard. It wasn’t until she’d signed the lease that the landlord informed her she’d have to keep up with all the yard work. It’d surprised her, how much she enjoyed mowing the lawn, especially on days like today, when exercise was the secondary goal. Something about the mundane physical task alleviated frustration. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kissin-tell-rough-riders-13/page-15.html","bookId":2694,"book":{"id":2694,"title":"Kissin\u0027 Tell (Rough Riders #13)","description":"Storyline: \n Kissin\u0027 Tell (Rough Riders #13) \n She once led him around by a string.
