{"id":83082,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"\"And last semester. Well, I can only imagine what it must have been like—the reports, the debriefings.\"\n I probably hadn\u0027t found anything important; after all, the underside of a drawer isn\u0027t a preferred hiding place for a spy—nothing about it is secure or protected. But it is a good hiding place for a woman—a place to keep something you want nearby but out of sight.\n \"And I want you to know,\" Mom went on, \"that I am so proud of you.\"\n Yes, that\u0027s right, not only was I invading my mother\u0027s personal space right under her nose, but that\u0027s the moment she chose to tell me how proud she was of my new-and-improved behavior! It was official:\n I was a terrible person.\n Then I felt the paper give. It fluttered through the air and landed right on my lap. And from that point on I barely heard a word my mother said.\n Dad. It was a picture of Dad—but like no picture I\u0027d ever seen, because for starters, he looked older than he did in the pictures Grandma had given me, and younger than he did in the pictures of him and my mom. And in this picture, my father wasn\u0027t alone.\n Mr. Solomon\u0027s arm was around my father\u0027s shoulders. They stood on a baseball field. They were young. They were strong. And if I hadn\u0027t known better, I would have sworn they were both immortal.\n But I did know better. And that, I guess, was the problem.\n \"Did you find what you needed, sweetheart?\" Mom asked, and I thought it was a really good question. I aimed my watch at the photo, imagined the faint click as I took a picture. \"Cam,\" Mom said again, moving toward me.\n \"I\u0027m not feeling too well,\" I said, and slipped the picture back to where my mother kept it hidden. From me. From herself. From whoever. I moved away from the desk, toward the door. \"Can I maybe have a rain check on supper?\"\n \"Cam,\" Mom said, stopping me. She put her hand against my forehead like Grandma Morgan always does. \"It could be a cold—you know something has been going around.\" I did know. I\u0027d already seen the proof in her trash can.\n \"I think I just need to go to bed,\" I said. \"It\u0027s pretty late.\"\n But then I opened the door, and there, in the Hall of History, I saw Bex.\n And Liz was sitting on her shoulders.\n Chapter Five\n Time\u0027s a strange thing at the Gallagher Academy. Usually it flies. But sometimes it gets really, really slow. Needless to say, this was one of those times.\n The Operatives modified a Mobile Observation Device (aka Macey\u0027s new digital camera) and attached it to the bookcase across from the entrance to the headmistress\u0027s office with a Retractable Adhesion Unit (aka duct tape) and programmed it to take pictures at ninety-second intervals.\n Down the corridor, I saw Macey kneeling in front of the mysteriously locked door to the East Wing.\n The Operatives secured an Entry/Exit Detection Device (aka a piece of string) to the doorknob in question, knowing it would fall off if the door was opened in The Operatives\u0027 absence.\n For a split second, everything seemed to freeze, but then I heard my mom say, \"What is it, Cam?\" She walked toward me.\n \"Nothing.\" I closed the door and leaned against it. \"It\u0027s just…\" It\u0027s just that my friends are completely insane and on the other side of this door right now, doing things that they really aren\u0027t supposed to be doing, and if you catch them you\u0027ll be really mad—or proud—but probably mad.\n \"It\u0027s just … I wanted to tell you that I think I\u0027m really in a good place this semester.\" (Because technically, at that moment, the best possible place was between the headmistress and my roommates.) \"And I was thinking about what you said,\" I went on. \"I\u0027m committed to—\"\n But then a bang on the door cut me off, and I had a bad feeling that Liz had fallen from Bex\u0027s shoulders and knocked herself unconscious on the doorknob.\n \"Cam,\" Mom said, inching closer. \"You gonna get that?\"\n But I didn\u0027t dare turn around. \"Get what?\" Another knock. \"Ooooh. Thaaaat.\"\n I opened the door. Please let it be Bex, I prayed. Or Liz … Or Macey … Or …\n Anyone but Joe Solomon!\n Oh my gosh! Could the night get any worse? Yes, it turns out—it could. Because not only was one of the CIA\u0027s best secret agents standing in front of me, but my best friends in the world were twenty feet behind him, being secretive and agenty! (I know because I could see Macey\u0027s hand holding a compact around the corner to see whether or not the coast was clear. Which, obviously, it wasn\u0027t!)\n I had to buy some time—a minute, thirty seconds at least—so Bex, Liz, and Macey could pull themselves from their hiding places and get out of there.\n So I said, \"Oh, hello, Mr. Solomon,\" because Madame Dabney has trained me to be socially gracious, and Mr. Solomon himself has trained me to act normal under the most abnormal circumstances.\n \"Ms. Morgan, I hate to bother you, but…\" Mr. Solomon looked past me toward my mother. \"Those records you asked for, Rachel.\" He handed Mom a plain brown envelope.\n An envelope bearing the word Blackthorne in Mr. Solomon\u0027s careful writing.\n And then time got really slow again.\n \"Cam?\" Mom said behind me. \"You really aren\u0027t feeling well, are you sweetie?\"\n \"No,\" I muttered. I was staring at the first piece of concrete evidence that Blackthorne wasn\u0027t some weird dream I\u0027d had, and yet I just stood there, looking at my Covert Operations instructor but seeing the man in the picture—my father\u0027s friend.\n \"Okay, I\u0027m going to go,\" I said with a glance at my mother. \"And you guys have probably got… stuff… to do. And …\"\n I could have said a dozen things in a dozen languages, but before I could blurt a single one I heard a voice at the end of the Hall of History call, \"There you are!\"\n And then the thing that I\u0027d been fearing happened: Mr. Solomon turned around.\n But there\u0027s a difference between getting caught and allowing yourself to be found, and right then, Macey, Bex, and Liz were walking through the Hall of History, hiding in plain sight.\n \"We can\u0027t hold movie night forever, Cam,\" Bex said.\n So I turned my back on my mom and Mr. Solomon, and then, envelope or not, I walked away.\n Do you know how many things I was feeling as we got to the room? A lot. A lot. For starters, there was the crab-puff thing. And then there was the envelope thing. But as soon as our door was closed and our stereo was on, I turned to my best friends and cried, \"You planted surveillance equipment in the Hall of History while my mother was in her office!\" because I guess that was the thing I felt the loudest.\n \"Oh, Cam,\" Bex said, shrugging slightly. \"It was just a little recon.\"\n Deep down, all I really wanted to do was put on my comfy pajamas and go to sleep and brush the crab-puff taste out of my mouth (but not necessarily in that order.) But instead I snapped, \"Yeah, well you almost got caught—you almost got me caught. And getting debriefed by the security department isn\u0027t as much fun as it sounds, guys.\" I forced a laugh. \"Trust me.\"\n I said it kind of snotty, but Bex didn\u0027t answer. She didn\u0027t even get mad. Instead, she looked at me as only a best friend-slash-spy-slash-person-who-has-been-trained-on-reading-body-language can do. She climbed onto her bed and crossed her long legs. \"You found something.\"\n I could have denied it. I could have lied. But right then I was in the one room in the mansion where I could never disappear.\n \"Actually, I did.\" I told them what I\u0027d found in my mother\u0027s desk. I listed the contents of her trash—even the shades of her lipstick. And finally, I told them about the envelope.\n \"We\u0027ve got to get it!\" Bex exclaimed, sounding as excited as a kid on Christmas morning. \"We can wait until everyone goes to bed and then break into the office.\"\n \"That\u0027s not a good idea, Bex,\" I said as I slipped on my pajamas, took off my watch, and pulled my hair into an old stretched-out hairband.\n \"Come on, Cam,\" Bex pleaded, while Macey and Liz looked on. \"If anyone can get into the headmistress\u0027s office, it\u0027s you!\"\n \"No!\" I snapped, maybe because I knew better than to let Bex work up any momentum; maybe because I was still completely on edge. But maybe because sometimes a girl just really needs to snap at someone who she knows will forgive her later.\n I started for the bathroom, but Bex was right behind me. \"Why not?\"\n \"Because it\u0027s not a game,\" I said, talking louder than I wanted, but somehow unable to lower my voice. \"Because sometimes spies get caught. Because sometimes spies get hurt. Because sometimes—\"\n \"We\u0027ve got pictures!\" Liz cried triumphantly. Thin wires ran from my new watch to her computer. Images flashed across the screen. Crab puffs. File folders. And finally…\n Dad.\n Because sometimes spies don\u0027t come home.\n The picture I had taken filled the screen. My jeans were like a denim border—a frame behind the snapshot that had landed on my lap. Liz zoomed in. She magnified.\n \"Ooh,\" Macey said. \"Who\u0027s the hottie?\"\n \"That\u0027s Mr. Solomon, Macey,\" I said, starting for the bathroom because, well, I didn\u0027t want to cry in front of my friends. And one of the advantages of the face-washing process is that you have an excuse for squinting your eyes and looking away.\n \"Not Mr. Solomon,\" Macey said. \"The other guy. Is he Blackthorne?\"\n \"No, Macey,\" Bex said, saving me the trouble. I glanced in the bathroom mirror and saw Bex turn from the screen and catch my eye in the glass. \"That\u0027s Cam\u0027s dad.\"\n We study a lot of dangerous stuff at the Gallagher Academy, but there are some things so feared that they\u0027re never, ever mentioned. Everyone knows my dad was in the CIA. That he went on a mission and never came home. Now there\u0027s an empty grave in the family plot in Nebraska. Everyone knows, but no one ever asks to hear the story. And that night, Macey was no different.\n I splashed cold water on my face and flossed my teeth, clinging to my routine—to normal. I might have stayed in there, flossing forever, if I hadn\u0027t heard Liz say, \"Oh. My. Gosh.\"\n In the mirror I saw her staring at the picture on the screen with the eyes of a scientist, taking in every detail of the faces of the two boys.\n \"Cam,\" Liz called, without taking her eyes from the screen. \"You\u0027ve got to look at this!\"\n I moved from teeth-flossing to face-moisturizing— anything to stay busy. \"I\u0027ve seen it already,\" I told her.\n \"No, Cam,\" Liz said, pointing at the bright screen in the dim room. \"Look! Look at his shirt! Mr. Solomon\u0027s T-shirt!\"\n But she didn\u0027t have to finish, because there…magnified—enhanced—I saw what I hadn\u0027t noticed in my mother\u0027s office. I read the words BLACKTHORNE INSTITUTE FOR BOYS.\n \"It\u0027s a school,\" Macey said slowly.\n \"A boys\u0027 school!\" Liz cried.\n I looked at the picture and said what everyone else was thinking. \"For spies?\"\n Chapter Six\n I\u0027ve always heard that the hardest thing for a spy isn\u0027t knowing things—it\u0027s acting like you don\u0027t know things you\u0027re not supposed to know. But I\u0027d never really appreciated the difference until then. Looking at Mr. Solomon was hard, talking to my mom was impossible, and the whole next day felt like a dream. A very weird there\u0027s-a-boys\u0027-school-for-spies-that-nobody-ever-told-me-about nightmare. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-spy-gallagher-girls-2/page-6.html","bookId":2747,"book":{"id":2747,"title":"Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy (Gallagher Girls #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy (Gallagher Girls #2) \n Cammie Morgan is back, and it\u0027s clear that her life hasn\u0027t calmed down since the events of I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You.
