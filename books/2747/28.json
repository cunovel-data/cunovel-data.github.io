{"id":83104,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"I pointed to the bruise on his face. \"That looks bad.\" But Zach shook his head. \"It isn\u0027t. He—\" \"Hits like a girl?\" I teased. But Zach didn\u0027t smile; he didn\u0027t laugh. Something else hung in the air between us as he said, \"Not the girls I know.\" I thought about the boy I\u0027d met in D.C.—the kid who\u0027d teased me all semester—and I tried to reconcile those images with the boy who stood before me. Zach was still cocky; he was still tough. But on the other hand, he\u0027d offered me candy once when I was hungry, and I couldn\u0027t help thinking that maybe that made him sort of knightlike after all. That maybe it wasn\u0027t his fault his armor was kind of tarnished. A semester was gone, so I didn\u0027t let myself think about what might have happened if things had been different. After all, trust is a hard thing for any girl—especially a Gallagher Girl—and this is the life I\u0027ve chosen. These are questions and doubts that will probably follow me for the rest of my life. I turned slowly, started to walk away—toward my friends and my future and whatever was supposed to come next. \"Oh, and Cammie.\" At the sound of his voice I spun around, expecting to hear him crack a joke or call me Gallagher Girl. The last thing I expected was to feel his arms sliding around me, to sense the whole world turning upside down as Zach dipped me in the middle of the foyer and pressed his lips to mine. Then he smiled that smile I\u0027d come to know. \"I always finish what I start.\" He stepped toward the open door and the warm spring sun that was just waiting to burst into summer, a new season. Another clean slate. \"So this is good-bye?\" I asked. \"Come on, Gallagher Girl.\" Zach turned to me. He winked. \"What would be the odds of that?\" He walked outside and got in the van, and as far as I could tell, he never looked back— Because neither did I. I didn\u0027t think about the rules we\u0027d broken or the time we\u0027d wasted. I didn\u0027t dwell on the questions that had seemed so important once and were now fading like a long-lost note in a heavy rain. There are secrets in my world. They stack side by side like dominoes, and last September they\u0027d started to fall—all because I\u0027d said hello to a boy. Now I was saying good-bye to another one. But now, at least in Zach\u0027s case, I finally knew the truth. Well…most of the truth. And it had set me free. The whole summer lay ahead of us—time to rest, time to wait. And when the future comes—no matter what comes with it—I\u0027ll be smarter. I\u0027ll be stronger. I\u0027ll be ready.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-spy-gallagher-girls-2/page-28.html","bookId":2747,"book":{"id":2747,"title":"Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy (Gallagher Girls #2)","description":"Storyline: Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy (Gallagher Girls #2) Cammie Morgan is back, and it\u0027s clear that her life hasn\u0027t calmed down since the events of I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You.
