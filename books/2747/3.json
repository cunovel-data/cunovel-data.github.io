{"id":83079,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Thirty minutes later I was in my uniform, making my way down the spiral staircase, toward the Grand Hall with the rest of the student body. Well, most of the student body.\n \"Where\u0027s Macey?\"\n \"Oh, she\u0027s back already,\" Liz said, but I knew that much. After all, it was kind of hard to miss Macey\u0027s closetful of designer clothes, her stash of ridiculously expensive skin care products (many of which are legal only in Europe), and the fact that someone had very recently been sleeping in her bed.\n The last time I\u0027d seen our fourth roommate, she\u0027d been preparing for three weeks in the Swiss Alps with her senator father, her cosmetics-heiress mother, and a celebrity chef from the Food Channel; but Macey McHenry had come back early. And now she was nowhere to be seen.\n Bex was looking around, too, staring over the heads of the seventh graders walking in front of us. \"She said she had a bit of research to do in the library, but that was hours ago. I thought she\u0027d meet us down here, but…\" she trailed off, still looking.\n \"You guys go eat,\" I said, stepping away from the crowd and starting down the hall. \"I\u0027ll find her.\"\n I pulled open the heavy library doors and stepped inside the massive bookshelf-lined room. Comfy leather couches and old oak tables surrounded a roaring fire. And there, in the center of it all, was Macey McHenry. Her head was resting on the latest edition of Molecular Chemistry Monthly, pink highlighter marks were on her cheek, and a puddle of drool had run from her mouth to the wooden desktop.\n \"Macey,\" I whispered, reaching out to gently shake her shoulder.\n \"What? Huh…Cammie?\" She struggled upright and blinked at me. \"What time is it?\" she cried, jumping up and knocking a stack of flash cards to the floor.\n I bent down to help her pick them up. \"The welcome-back dinner is about to start.\"\n \"Great,\" she said, sounding like someone who didn\u0027t think it was great at all.\n Her glossy black hair stuck out at odd angles, and her normally bright blue eyes were dazed with sleep. Even though I knew better, I couldn\u0027t help but say, \"So, did you have a nice break?\"\n She cut me a look that could kill (and will—just as soon as our head scientist, Dr. Fibs, perfects his looks-can-kill technology).\n \"Sure.\" Macey blew a stray piece of hair away from her beautiful face and pulled the last of the flash cards into a pile. \"Right up until my parents saw my grades.\"\n \"But you got great grades! You covered nearly two semesters\u0027 worth of work. You—\"\n \"Got four A\u0027s and three B\u0027s,\" Macey finished for me.\n \"I know!\" I cried. After all, I had personally tutored Macey in the finer points of macroeconomics, molecular regeneration, and conversational Swahili.\n \"And according to the Senator,\" Macey said, keeping up her unspoken vow never to call her father by name, \"there\u0027s no way I am capable of earning four A\u0027s and three B\u0027s, so therefore I must be cheating.\"\n \"But …\" I struggled to find the words. \"But…Gallagher Girls don\u0027t cheat!\" And it\u0027s true. Not to sound dramatic or anything, but a Gallagher Girl\u0027s real grades don\u0027t come in pass or fail—they\u0027re measured in life or death. But Senator McHenry didn\u0027t know that. I looked at the gorgeous debutante who had flunked out of every prep academy on the East Coast and was now earning A\u0027s and B\u0027s at spy school, and I realized the senator didn\u0027t know a lot of things. Not even his own daughter.\n The library was empty around us, but I still lowered my voice as I said, \"Macey, you should tell my mom. She could call your dad. We could—\"\n \"No way!\" Macey said, as if I never let her have any fun. \"Besides, I already know what I\u0027m going to do.\"\n We\u0027d reached the heavy doors of the library, but I paused for the answer. \"What?\"\n \"Study.\" Macey cocked a perfectly plucked eyebrow. \"Next time I\u0027ll get all A\u0027s.\" And then she smiled as if, after sixteen years of practice, she\u0027d finally found the ultimate way to defy her parents.\n I heard voices in the corridor outside, which was strange because at that moment the entire Gallagher Academy student body was waiting in the Grand Hall. Something made us freeze. And wait. And despite the heavy doors between us, I could clearly hear my mother say, \"No, Cammie doesn\u0027t know anything.\"\n Well, as a spy (not to mention a girl), there are many, many sentences that will make me stop and listen, and, needless to say, \"Cammie doesn\u0027t know anything\" is totally one of them!\n I leaned closer to the door while, beside me, Macey\u0027s big blue eyes got even wider. She leaned in and whispered, \u0027What don\u0027t you know?\"\n \"She didn\u0027t suspect anything?\" Mr. Solomon, my dreamy CoveOps instructor, asked.\n \"What didn\u0027t you suspect?\" asked Macey.\n Well, of course the whole point of not knowing and not suspecting is that I neither knew nor suspected, but I couldn\u0027t point that out because, at the moment, my mother was on the opposite side of the door saying, \"No, she was being debriefed at the time.\"\n I thought back to the long, quiet ride from D.C., the way my mother had stared at the frosty countryside as she\u0027d told me that she hadn\u0027t watched my interrogation—that she\u0027d had things to do.\n \"We can\u0027t tell her, Joe,\" Mom said. \"We can\u0027t tell anyone. Not until we have to.\"\n \"Not about black thorn?\"\n \"Not about anything.\" And then Mom sighed. \"I just want things to stay as normal as possible for as long as possible.\"\n I looked at Macey. Normal had just taken on a whole new meaning.\n After they left, Macey and I slipped back to the Grand Hall and the sophomore table. Mom had already taken her place at the front of the room. I know that Liz whispered, \"What took you so long?\" as we sat down. But beyond that, I wasn\u0027t sure of anything, because, to tell you the truth, I was having a little trouble hearing. And talking. And walking.\n All moms have secrets—mine more than most—and even though I\u0027ve always known that there are lots of things my mother can never tell me, it had never occurred to me that there were things she might be keeping from me. It may not sound like a big difference, but it is.\n Mom gripped the podium in front of her and looked out at the hundred girls who sat ready for a new semester. \"Welcome back, everyone. I hope you had a wonderful winter break,\" she said.\n \"Cammie,\" Bex whispered, eyeing me and then Macey. \"Something\u0027s going on with you two. Isn\u0027t it?\"\n Before I could answer, my mother continued, \"I\u0027d like to begin with the very exciting news that this semester we will be offering a new course, History of Espionage, taught by Professor Buckingham.\" Light applause filled the Grand Hall as our most senior staff member gave a small wave.\n \"And also,\" my mother said slowly, \"as many of you have no doubt noticed, the East Wing will be off-limits for the time being, since recent work to the mansion revealed that it has been contaminated by fumes from the chemistry labs.\"\n \"Cammie,\" Liz said, scooting closer, \"you look kind of… pukey.\"\n Well I felt kind of pukey.\n \"And most of all,\" my mother said, \"I want to wish everyone a great semester.\"\n The silence that had filled the hall a moment before evaporated into a chorus of talking girls and passing plates. I tried to turn the volume down, to listen to the thoughts that swirled inside my mind like the snow that blew outside. I closed my eyes tightly, forcing the room to dissolve away, until suddenly, everything became clear.\n And I whispered the fact that I\u0027d known for years but only just remembered.\n \"There is no ventilation access from the chem labs to the East Wing.\"\n Chapter Three\n There are many pros and cons to living in a two-hundred-year-old mansion. For example: having about a dozen highly secluded and yet perfectly inbounds places where you can sit and discuss classified information: PRO.\n The fact that none of these places are well heated and/or insulated when you are discussing said information in the middle of the winter: CON.\n Two hours after our welcome-back dinner, Macey was leaning against the stone wall at the top of one of the mansion\u0027s tallest towers, drawing her initials on the window\u0027s frosty panes. Liz paced, Bex shivered, and I sat on the floor with my arms around my knees, too tired to get my blood flowing despite the chill that had seeped through my uniform and settled in my bones.\n \"So that\u0027s it, then?\" Bex asked. \"That\u0027s everything your mom and Mr. Solomon said? Verbatim?\"\n Macey and I looked at each other, recalling the conversation we\u0027d overheard and the story we\u0027d just told. Then we both nodded and said, \"Verbatim.\"\n At that moment, the entire sophomore class was probably enjoying our last homework-free night for a very long time (rumor had it Tina Walters was organizing a Jason Bourne-athon), but the four of us stayed in that tower room, freezing our you-know-whats off, listening for the creaking hinges of the heavy oak door at the base of the stairs that would warn us if we were no longer alone.\n \"I can\u0027t believe it,\" Liz said as she continued to walk back and forth—maybe to keep warm, but probably because…well…Liz has always been a pacer. (And we\u0027ve got the worn spots on our bedroom floor to prove it.)\n \"Cam,\" Liz asked, \"are you sure the East Wing couldn\u0027t have been contaminated by fumes from the chem labs?\"\n \"Of course she\u0027s sure,\" Bex said with a sigh.\n \"But are you absolutely, positively, one hundred-percent sure ?\" Liz asked again. After all, as the youngest person ever published in Scientific American, Liz kind of likes things verified, cross-referenced, and proven beyond a shadow of a doubt.\n \"Cam,\" Bex said, turning to me, \"how many ventilation shafts are there in the kitchen?\"\n \"Fourteen—unless you\u0027re counting the pantry. Are you counting the pantry?\" I asked, which must have been enough to prove my expertise, because Macey rolled her eyes and sank to the floor beside me. \"She\u0027s sure.\"\n In the dim light of the cold room I could see snowflakes swirl in the wind outside, blowing from the mansion\u0027s roof (or … well…the parts of the roof that aren\u0027t protected with electrified security shingles). But inside, the four of us were quiet and still.\n \"Why would they lie?\" Liz asked, but Bex, Macey, and I just looked at her, none of us really wanting to point out the obvious: Because they\u0027re spies.\n It\u0027s something Bex and I had understood all our lives. Judging by the look on her face, Macey had caught on, too (after all, her dad is in politics). But Liz hadn\u0027t grown up knowing that lies aren\u0027t just the things we tell—they\u0027re the lives we lead. Liz still wanted to believe that parents and teachers always tell the truth, that if you eat your vegetables and brush your teeth, nothing bad will ever happen. I\u0027d known better for a long time, but Liz still had a little naivete left. I, for one, hated to see her lose it.\n \"What\u0027s black thorn?\" Macey asked, looking at each of us in turn. \"I mean, you guys don\u0027t know either, right? It\u0027s not just a me-being-the-new-girl thing?\"\n Everyone shook their heads no, then looked to me. \"Never heard of it,\" I said.\n And I hadn\u0027t. It wasn\u0027t the name of any covert operation we\u0027d ever analyzed, any scientific breakthrough we\u0027d ever studied. Black thorn or Blackthorne or whatever could have been anyone, anything, anywhere! And whoever … or whatever … or wherever it was, it had made my mother miss some quality mother-daughter interrogation time. It had also forced my Covert Operations instructor to hold a clandestine conversation with my headmistress. It had crept inside the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women (or at least its East Wing), and so there we were, not quite sure what a Gallagher Girl was supposed to do now. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-spy-gallagher-girls-2/page-3.html","bookId":2747,"book":{"id":2747,"title":"Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy (Gallagher Girls #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy (Gallagher Girls #2) \n Cammie Morgan is back, and it\u0027s clear that her life hasn\u0027t calmed down since the events of I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You.
