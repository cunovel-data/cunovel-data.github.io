{"id":83081,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\"This is not a required course, ladies. You no longer have to be here.\" Mr. Solomon turned around. His green eyes bore into us, and at that moment Joe Solomon wasn\u0027t just our hottest teacher, he was also our scariest. \"Six of your classmates have already chosen a relatively safe life on the research and operations track of study. If you can\u0027t remember a fifty-minute lecture, then I\u0027d encourage you to join them.\"\n He turned back to the board and continued writing. \"Your memory is your first and best weapon, ladies. Learn to use it.\"\n I sat there for a long time, absorbing what he\u0027d said, what it meant, knowing that he was right. Our memories are the only weapons we take with us no matter where we go, but then I thought about the second part of his statement— Don\u0027t make things harder than they have to be. I thought about what I\u0027d overheard the night before. The look in my mother\u0027s eyes on the long, quiet ride home. And finally…Josh. And then I realized that my life would be a whole lot easier if there were some things I could forget.\n Chapter Four\n Summary of Surveillance By utilizing the \"least-intrusive means possible\" model of covert operations, The Operatives were able to ascertain the following:\n According to some very popular Internet search engines, \"black thorn\" is a common type of rose fungus, but does not appear to be a code name for any rogue government conspiracy theories.\n There are approximately 1,947 people in the United States named Blackthorne, but, according to the IRS, none of them have listed their profession as Spy, Spook, Ghoul, Assassin, Hitter, Pro, Freelancer, Black Bag Man (or woman), Operative, Agent, or Pavement Artist.\n Seeing through the door to the East Wing wasn\u0027t possible, because, despite rumors to the contrary, Dr. Fibs\u0027s X-ray vision goggles had not passed beyond the prototype phase. (Which also explained why he was wearing that eye patch.)\n A good thing about going to spy school is that you have genius friends with incredible abilities who are able to help you with any \"special projects\" that may come up. The bad part is that they really get into those \"projects.\" Way into them.\n \"It\u0027s got to be in here somewhere!\" Liz cried over the sound of heavy books crashing onto hard wood as she dropped volumes nine through fourteen of Surveillance Through the Centuries onto the library table.\n I looked around the quiet room, waiting for someone to shush her, but all I heard was the crackling of wood in the fireplace and the sigh of a girl who, after spending every spare moment for a week barricaded in the library, was starting to lose faith in books. (And Liz is the girl who actually slept with a copy of Advanced Encryption and You during finals week of our eighth grade year!)\n Macey tossed aside The Chronicles of Chemical Warfare that lay on her lap. \"Maybe it\u0027s not in the library,\" Macey said, and I seriously thought Liz was going to hyperventilate or something. She might have if Macey hadn\u0027t crossed her legs and asked, \"So what does that mean?\"\n Oh my gosh! I can\u0027t believe we hadn\u0027t asked that question before—that somehow we\u0027d forgotten one of the basic rules of covert operations: everything means something! Not finding something significant was maybe the most significant thing of all.\n \"Do you know how current something has to be not to be in these books?\" Liz asked, backing away, sounding slightly terrified and a little bit giddy. She looked at the volumes on the table as if they were so dangerous they might explode (which is silly, since everyone knows the so-top-secret-they\u0027ll-explode-if-you-read-them-without-clearance books are stored in Sublevel Three).\n \"So black thorn must be—\" Macey started, looking at me.\n \"Classified,\" I finished. \"Really classified.\"\n Spies keep secrets—it\u0027s what we do. So we sat in silence while the fire crackled and the truth washed over us: If Blackthorne was that Top Secret, then I was sure we\u0027d never find it.\n \"You know, Cam,\" Bex said, smiling a smile that might be alarming on an ordinary girl, but on a girl with Bex\u0027s special talents it\u0027s downright terrifying, \"there is one place we haven\u0027t looked.\" She tapped a finger against her chin in a gesture that, even for Bex, was especially dramatic. \"Now, who do we know who has access to the headmistress\u0027s office?\"\n \"No, Bex.\" I sat up straight and began stacking and restacking books. \"No. No. No. I cannot spy on my mom!\"\n \"Why not?\" Bex asked as if I\u0027d just told her I couldn\u0027t pull off wearing red lipstick (which, by the way, I can\u0027t).\n \"Because…she\u0027s my mom\" I said, not even trying to hide the duh in my voice. \"And she\u0027s one of the CIA\u0027s very best operatives. And…she\u0027s my mom!\"\n \"Exactly! She would never suspect\"—Bex paused for effect—\"her own daughter.\" And then Bex, Liz, and Macey looked at me as if this were the best plan ever. Which it wasn\u0027t. At all. I mean, I know a little something about plans, having helped my father design a Trojan horse-type scenario to infiltrate a former Soviet nuclear missile silo that had been taken over by terrorists when I was seven. And this was not a good plan!\n \"Bex!\" I cried. \"I don\u0027t want to do this. It—\"\n But before I could finish, the library door swung open and I heard Macey say, \"Hello, Ms. Morgan.\"\n Even though I\u0027d been sitting relatively still for forty-five minutes, my heart felt like I\u0027d just run a mile. Mom looked down at the Portuguese translation of 101 Classic Covers and the Spies Who\u0027ve Used Them and said, \"What are you girls doing in the library on a sunny day like this?\"\n \"COW extra credit,\" we all said, citing the cover story we\u0027d agreed on before we left the room.\n But still, my pulse didn\u0027t slow down. I just sat there, reminding myself that we weren\u0027t breaking any rules. I hadn\u0027t really told any lies. (Mr. Smith had assigned extra credit, after all.) Technically, I hadn\u0027t broken my promise. Yet.\n \"Okay,\" Mom said, smiling. \"I\u0027ll see you tonight, Cam.\"\n I felt Bex\u0027s eyes on me and knew what she was thinking—that I was going to be spending the evening with my mother. In her office. What kind of operative would I be if I didn\u0027t take advantage of the situation?\n But then I thought about my mother and wondered what kind of daughter I would be if I did.\n Things I\u0027ve Done That I\u0027m Not Necessarily Proud Of:\n A list by Cameron Morgan\n One time I accidentally spilled all of Bex\u0027s detangling conditioner and refilled the bottle with\n volumizing conditioner, and her hair got really big for a few weeks, but I never told her why.\n I once wore Liz\u0027s favorite yoga pants without permission and totally stretched them out. Also,\n her favorite sweater.\n Whenever I\u0027m in Nebraska I always pretend I\u0027m too weak to open pickle jars, because Grandpa\n Morgan likes to do it for me.\n As I have thoroughly documented elsewhere, I once had a clandestine relationship with a really\n cute, really sweet boy and then lied about it.\n A lot.\n · On the first Sunday after winter break in my sophomore year, I helped Liz implant a camera\n in the watch Grandma gave me for my birthday. And then I wore it to Sunday-night supper in my\n mother\u0027s office so that I could do the worst thing I\u0027ve ever done. Ever.\n When you\u0027re the daughter of two secret agents, you learn pretty early that spies walk a moral tightrope. We do bad things for good reasons, and for the most part we can live with that. But that Sunday night, when I sat in my mother\u0027s office eating microwavable crab puffs and fingering my new custom-made spy watch, I thought about my cover: hungry daughter bonding with her mother-slash-mentor. Then I thought about my mission: do a basic recon of the headmistress\u0027s office and hope there will be a report titled Operation Black Thorn or Contents of the East Wing just lying around.\n Sunday-night supper in my mother\u0027s office is something I\u0027ve been doing ever since Mom and I came to the Gallagher Academy. Usually, however, I don\u0027t feel nauseous until after I\u0027ve eaten (because even though Mom once manufactured an antidote for a rare poison by using the contents of a hotel minibar, she has yet to master microwaves and hot plates).\n \"So,\" Mom said, gesturing to the small silver tray of puffs, \"how are they?\"\n (Note to self: research bioweapon potential of microwavable crab puffs.)\n \"They\u0027re great!\" I lied, and my mother smiled. No, scratch that—she glowed. And at that moment I seriously wanted to back out, to put the watch in my pocket and forget how I\u0027d already memorized the exact position of everything on her desk in case I got a chance to snoop and then had to put things back. I wanted to stop being a spy and start being a daughter. Especially when Mom glanced at my wrist and said, \"You\u0027re wearing Grandma\u0027s watch.\"\n I rubbed my thumb over the smooth glass that now doubled as a telephoto lens. \"Yeah.\"\n \"That\u0027s nice,\" she said, and smiled happily. Even though she seemed to be fine now, I thought about the worried woman I\u0027d shared a limo with from D.C., and the conversation I\u0027d overheard. I wasn\u0027t the only operative in that room clinging to her legend.\n And then, before I could stop to think, I blurted, \"Do you have any fingernail clippers?\" Mom looked at me for a second, and I knew I couldn\u0027t back out now, so I held out my right hand, which thankfully, wasn\u0027t shaking. \"I\u0027ve got a hangnail that\u0027s driving me crazy.\"\n \"Sure, sweetie,\" Mom said. \"In my desk. Top drawer.\"\n So see, I didn\u0027t even have to pick the lock or fake the fingerprint-activated drawers. I was perfectly within my daughterly rights as I moved to my mother\u0027s desk and rummaged around for the clippers.\n A brief search of the headmistress\u0027s desk revealed the following:\n Headmistress Morgan had ten different lipsticks in her desk (only three of which were for purely cosmetic uses).\n Mom carried a small pan into her private bathroom and turned on the water, and that\u0027s when I took pictures of every single thing in her trash can. Headmistress Morgan had, evidently, been fighting off a cold, because her trash contained fourteen used tissues and an empty bottle of Vitamin C.\n I knocked a paper clip dispenser off her desk and channeled Liz with a loud \"Oopsy daisy.\" Then I huddled on the floor as I picked up paper clips with one hand and rifled through her bottom desk drawers with the other.\n Of all the items the Gallagher Academy receives royalty revenues from, Band-Aids are surprisingly the most profitable.\n I could hear my mother on the far side of the room, stirring things, pouring things. \"Did you find them?\" she called out.\n I held up the nail clippers with one hand while I closed her bottom drawer with the other.\n I smiled and waved my manicured fingers and thought, I am a terrible daughter.\n But my mother only smiled in return, because maybe I\u0027m also a pretty good spy.\n Ironically, the one person who could explain the difference was the one person I totally couldn\u0027t ask.\n I placed the nail clippers back where I\u0027d found them and looked down at a desk that even an expert would swear had never been touched. I placed my palms against the middle drawer and felt my fingertips brush against the smooth wood of the underside, the cool metal track on which it ran. But something else, too. Something thin and worn.\n \"I know this semester is going to be a big adjustment for you, kiddo,\" Mom said. She stirred a bubbling concoction in a Crock-Pot while I pressed a finger against the paper—felt it move. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-spy-gallagher-girls-2/page-5.html","bookId":2747,"book":{"id":2747,"title":"Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy (Gallagher Girls #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy (Gallagher Girls #2) \n Cammie Morgan is back, and it\u0027s clear that her life hasn\u0027t calmed down since the events of I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You.
