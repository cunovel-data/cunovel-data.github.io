{"id":83085,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"We were free. We were clear. We thought. Chapter Nine Overconfidence is a spy\u0027s worst enemy, so to be on the safe side, Bex and I decided to split up when we left the Metro station. We had exactly twenty minutes to make it to the Museum of American History and our rendezvous with Mr. Solomon. Twenty more minutes to make sure we really were clear. I slipped into the shadows of the Metro station and watched Bex ascend the escalator, then waited long enough to be certain no one followed her. Then I headed to the elevator, but as I reached for the button, another hand beat me to it. \"Hey,\" one of the boys from the park bench said. He did that half head nod thing that all boys seem to do … or at least the boys I know. Which mainly means Josh. \"Hi,\" I replied, pushing the button again, hoping to make the elevator come faster, because the last time a random boy had said hi to me, things had ended badly—like Mr.-Solomon-practically-being-run-over-by-a-forklift badly. And needless to say, that\u0027s not the kind of thing that looks good on a girl\u0027s permanent record. When the elevator doors slid open, I was kind of, sort of hoping he wouldn\u0027t step inside, but of course he did; and since the Metro station was forever and a day underground, the elevator ride was forever and a day long. The boy rested against the railing. He was slightly shorter and broader through the shoulders, but in the blurry reflection of the elevator doors, he almost looked like Josh. \"So,\" the boy said, pointing to the crest on my coat. \"The Guggenheim Academy—\" \"Gallagher Academy,\" I corrected. \"I\u0027ve never heard of it.\" Which was kind of the point, but I didn\u0027t say so. \"Well, it\u0027s my school.\" The elevator seemed to move slower and slower as the clock in my head ticked louder and louder, and I thought about how Mr. Solomon might make us walk back to Roseville if no one achieved our mission objectives. \"You in a hurry or something?\" the boy asked. \"Actually, I\u0027m supposed to meet my teacher at the ruby slipper exhibit. I\u0027ve only got twenty minutes, and if I\u0027m late, he\u0027ll kill me.\" (Not a lie, but maybe an exaggeration—I hoped.) \"How do you know?\" \"Because he said, \u0027Meet me at the ruby slipper exhibit.\u0027\" \"No.\" The boy was smiling, shaking his head. \"How do you know you only have twenty minutes? You\u0027re not wearing a watch.\" \"My friend just told me.\" The lie was smooth and easy, and I was a little bit proud of it, happy that I didn\u0027t have to think about how, in forty-five seconds, this boy had noticed something Josh hadn\u0027t seen in four months. \"You fidget a lot,\" he said. Make that two things Josh hadn\u0027t seen. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said, but I wasn\u0027t. \"I have low blood sugar.\" Lie number three. \"I need to eat something.\" Which wasn\u0027t really a lie, since…well… I was hungry. And then stranger-boy totally knocked me for a loop, because he handed me a bag of M\u0026M\u0027S. \"Here. I ate most of them already.\" \"Oh…um …\" What was that I\u0027d said about strangers with candy? \"That\u0027s okay. Thanks, though.\" He shoved the candy back in his pocket. \"Oh,\" the boy said. \"Okay.\" We finally reached the surface, and the doors slid open onto the Mall, where dusk had somehow fallen in the last ten minutes. \"Thanks again for the candy.\" I darted outside, knowing that to be safe I couldn\u0027t take the most direct way to the museum—not yet. I had to— Wait. I was being followed! But not in any kind of covert sense! \"Where are you going?\" I said, spinning on the boy behind me. \"I thought we were going to meet your teacher in the wonderful world of Oz.\" \"We!\" \"Sure. I\u0027m going with you.\" \"No you\u0027re not,\" I snapped, because A) The aforementioned forklift thing, and B) I\u0027m pretty sure bringing a boy to a clandestine rendezvous isn\u0027t in the CIA handbook. \"Look,\" the boy said confidently. \"It\u0027s dark. You\u0027re by yourself. And this is D.C.\" Oh my gosh. It\u0027s like he had Grandma Morgan on speed-dial or something. \"And you\u0027ve only got\"—he pondered it—\"fifteen minutes to meet your teacher.\" He was wrong by ninety seconds, but I didn\u0027t say so. All I knew was that I couldn\u0027t shake him—not without creating a lot more drama than letting him tag along was going to cause, so I just quickened my pace and said, \"Fine.\" As we walked against the cold wind, I told myself that this was good; this was fine. Nobody looking for a Gallagher Girl would expect me to be with a boy. He was cover. He was useful. \"You can really walk fast,\" he said, but I didn\u0027t say anything back. \"So, do you have a name?\" he asked, as if that were just the most innocent question ever. As if that isn\u0027t how broken hearts and broken covers always start. \"Sure. Lots of them.\" That was probably the most truthful thing I\u0027d told him yet, but the boy just smiled at me as if I were funny and flirty and cute. Let me tell you, I was none of those things, especially after not sleeping or eating, wearing a blindfold for an hour, then walking up and down the frozen Mall all day! My nose was running. My feet were killing me. All I really wanted to do was get to Dorothy\u0027s slippers, click my heels together, and go home. But instead I had to put up with a boy who assumed I needed protecting. A boy with whom I could never \"be myself.\" A boy who was staring at me as if he knew a secret—and worse—as if the secret was about me. \"Do you have a boyfriend?\" he asked. At this point I should point out that I was pretty sure the boy was flirting with me! Or at least I thought he was flirting with me, but without running it by Macey (and maybe plugging a sample into the voice-stress analyzer that Liz had developed for this very purpose), there was no way I could be sure. Last semester I\u0027d thought I was learning how to interpret boy-related things, but all I\u0027d really learned was that Gallagher Girls shouldn\u0027t flirt with normal boys—not because we won\u0027t like them. But because we might like them too much. And that would be the worst thing of all. \"Look, thanks for the chivalry and all, but it really isn\u0027t necessary,\" I muttered what may have been the understatement of the century, since I\u0027m pretty sure I could have killed him with my backpack. \"It\u0027s just up here.\" I pointed to the Museum of American History, which stood gleaming twenty yards away. \"And there\u0027s a cop over there.\" \"What?\" the boy said, glancing at the D.C. police officer that stood at the corner of the street, \"you think that guy can do a better job protecting you than I can?\" Actually, I thought Liz could have done a better job \"protecting\" me than he could, but instead I said, \"No, I think if you don\u0027t leave me alone, I can scream and that cop will arrest you.\" Somehow the boy seemed to know it was a joke…mostly. He stepped away and smiled. And for a moment I felt myself smile, too. \"Hey,\" I called to him, because, despite how annoying he was right then, a pang of guilt shot through my stomach. After all, he had been all knight-in-shining-armory. It wasn\u0027t his fault I\u0027m not the kind of girl who needs saving. \"Thanks anyway.\" He nodded. If it had been another day or I\u0027d been another girl, a hundred other things might have happened. But I had begun the semester with a promise to be myself, and the real me was still a girl on a mission. I darted for the doors and pushed my way inside, then slipped into a narrow hallway behind the help desk. I watched the entrance, waiting ninety seconds to be sure that I was clear. \"Bex.\" I tried my comms unit. \"Courtney…Mick…Kim …\" I told myself there was no way they\u0027d all been made. They were probably downstairs in the ice-cream parlor; or maybe waiting in the van. I grabbed a visitors\u0027 brochure from a stack on the help desk, slipped into a narrow stairwell, and began the three-story climb to the slippers, not really caring that I wouldn\u0027t get to see the sights. (After all, the \"Julia Child\u0027s Kitchen\" exhibit didn\u0027t even illustrate how she used to send coded messages in her recipes.) I could feel the ticking clock, almost see the look on Mr. Solomon\u0027s face and hear him say well done. I was so close; I scanned the map and took the stairs two at a time until I emerged at the far end of the floor, where the ruby slippers were displayed. There were no signs of Mr. Solomon or my classmates; not another soul in the great oval room. I felt the clock in my head chime five o\u0027clock. I stepped toward a case, which looked almost exactly like the one that stood in the center of the Hall of History. But instead of the sword that Gillian Gallagher had used to kill the first guy who\u0027d tried to assassinate President Lincoln, this case held a different kind of national treasure. The ruby slippers were so small, so delicate, that a part of me wanted to marvel in the coolness of being that close to something so rare. The rest of me just wanted to know why seven Gallagher Girls had gone radio silent and my teacher was nowhere to be seen! Then I heard Mr. Solomon\u0027s voice behind me. \"You\u0027re four seconds late.\" The shoes glistened as I spun around. \"But I\u0027m alone.\" \"No, Ms. Morgan. You\u0027re not.\" And then the boy from the elevator, the boy from the bench, stepped out of the shadows. And looked at me. And smiled. And said, \"Hi again, Gallagher Girl.\" Chapter Ten There are changes that come slowly—like evolution. And letting your hair grow out. And then there are changes that happen in a second—with a ringing phone, a well-timed glance. And in that moment I knew the Gallagher Academy wasn\u0027t alone. I knew there was a school for boys. And, most of all, I knew one of them had just gotten the best of me. This can\u0027t be happening, I chanted in my head. This can\u0027t be— \"Nice work, Zach,\" Mr. Solomon said. \"Zach\" winked at me, and I thought, This is totally happening! I\u0027d been sloppy. I\u0027d been distracted. And worst of all, I\u0027d let a boy stand between me and my mission objectives…again. The whole thing might have been too awful—too humiliating—to endure if I hadn\u0027t summoned the courage to say, \"Hi, Blackthorne Boy.\" Since I wasn\u0027t supposed to know the Blackthorne Institute for Boys even existed, there was a split second when I had the upper hand. Mr. Solomon blinked. Zach\u0027s mouth gaped open, and I was the person smiling when my teacher said, \"Very good, Ms. Morgan.\" But then he looked at the boy who had beaten me at my own game, and my face went as red as Dorothy\u0027s shoes. \"But not good enough.\" I saw the day like a movie in my mind: Zach and his friend watching Bex twirl in the breeze; the boys standing on the long escalator ride into the Metro station. They\u0027d been there—we\u0027d seen them! But we\u0027d thought they were just…boys. And they were. Kind of like we\u0027re just girls. \"Your mission was…what?\" I started, amazed by how even my voice sounded, how steady my pulse felt. \"To keep us from achieving our mission?\" The boy cocked his head and raised his eyebrows. \"Something like that.\" Then he smirked and exhaled a half laugh. \"I thought I could just make you late for your meeting. I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d actually tell me where it was and walk me halfway there.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-spy-gallagher-girls-2/page-9.html","bookId":2747,"book":{"id":2747,"title":"Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy (Gallagher Girls #2)","description":"Storyline: Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy (Gallagher Girls #2) Cammie Morgan is back, and it\u0027s clear that her life hasn\u0027t calmed down since the events of I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You.
