{"id":83098,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\"But you wouldn\u0027t do any of that,\" he said, standing. \"Would you, Gallagher Girl?\"\\n\\n \"Of course I—\"\\n\\n Then Zach reached into his pocket and pulled out a small wire that I had last seen disappearing inside an electrical outlet in the boys\u0027 rooms. He dropped the bug on the table, then leaned close to my ear and whispered, \"I\u0027m not all bad, Gallagher Girl.\"\\n\\n He pulled his jacket from the back of the chair and turned to walk away. \"Of course, I\u0027m not all good, either.\"\\n\\n I sat staring at the bug, thinking about what it meant, as Zach turned the corner and called, \"Thanks for the date!\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" Liz demanded, but I didn\u0027t know which part of my horrendous night she was referring to—the part where Zach had said he wasn\u0027t all good or all bad, or how he had routinely employed countersurveillance measures (a sign of the truly cautious and/or guilty), or that he\u0027d thought we\u0027d had a date! To tell you the truth, they all made me want to throw up.\\n\\n Our observation post was dusty and cramped, so we sat on the floor, surrounded by candy wrappers and half-eaten bags of microwave popcorn, notebooks, and charts; and the only thing that was clear was that no matter how much it seemed like normal boys played mind games—going to school with boys who have had actual classes on the subject is infinitely harder.\\n\\n \"So did he think it was a real date?\" Liz asked Macey. \"Because he didn\u0027t buy her anything. Or was it just a study date? Or did he see it as some kind of date with destiny or—\"\\n\\n \"Shhh,\" Bex said, holding an earpiece to her ear. \"We\u0027ve got audio!\" she said, bright eyes shining.\\n\\n 21:08 hours: Audio surveillance captured, a conversation in which many of The Subjects agreed that Headmistress Morgan is a \"smokin\u0027 babe,\" even though The Operatives know for a fact that Rachel Morgan opposes all forms of nicotine use.\\n\\n \"So he didn\u0027t get all the bugs?\" Liz asked.\\n\\n \"Or he left some,\" I said, running through all the possible scenarios. \"Maybe he wants us to keep listening so they can feed us false information. Or maybe he really did miss some bugs. Or maybe he left some in the other boys-rooms because he wants us to suspect them. Or maybe those other boys really did breach security, but Zach just can\u0027t say so because he\u0027s bound by some kind of freaky blood-oath-brotherhood pact that—\"\\n\\n \"Cam!\" Macey snapped, jerking me back to reality. (I fully admit the blood oath thing was a little out there, but the other options were totally viable.) \"He gave you the bug either to show you he\u0027s on to you, or to mess with your head, and…it\u0027s working.\"\\n\\n Spying is a game, and so is dating, I guess. It\u0027s all about strategy and playing to your strengths. People think espionage is all fun and games—that everything we do is cat and mouse, but that night I learned a CoveOps lesson as valuable as anything Joe Solomon had taught me. Real life in the clandestine services isn\u0027t cat and mouse—it\u0027s cat and cat.\\n\\n Chapter Twenty-two\\n\\n \"Lies,\" Mr. Solomon said the next morning as he walked into the classroom. \"We tell them to our friends,\" he said. \"We tell them to our enemies. And eventually…we tell them to ourselves.\" He turned to write on the board.\\n\\n \"A lie is typically accompanied by what physical symptoms, Ms. Lee?\" Mr. Solomon prompted.\\n\\n \"Dilated pupils, increased pulse, and atypical mannerisms,\" Kim said as I racked my brain, trying to remember if any of those things had been true with Zach the night before. If anything he\u0027d ever said had been true.\\n\\n \"Spies tell lies, ladies and gentlemen, but that\u0027s not what today is about. Today,\" Mr. Solomon said, \"is about how to spot them. Now, a seasoned operative will know how to control their pulse and voice, but for the purpose of today\u0027s lesson, I think these will come in handy.\"\\n\\n He handed each of us something that looked like the mood rings Bex and Liz and I had bought in Roseville in the eighth grade. \"Dr. Fibs has been kind enough to share these prototypes of a new portable voice-stress analyzer he\u0027s developing,\" Solomon continued. \"It\u0027s equipped with a microchip that will monitor a person\u0027s voice, and if they are lying, it will vibrate very softly, alerting the wearer to the he.\"\\n\\n The piece of plastic in my hands looked cheap— practically worthless—but like most things at the Gallagher Academy, there was a lot more to it than met the eye\\n\\n \"You have to be close to your subject,\" Mr. Solomon explained as he walked to Tina Walters\u0027s desk. \"And the rings can be fooled, with training. For example, ask me a question, Ms. Walters—any question.\"\\n\\n Tina hesitated a second or two before exclaiming, \"Do you have a girlfriend?\"\\n\\n Half the class giggled and the other sat silently in semi-horror. Joe Solomon bit back a smile and said, \"No.\"\\n\\n Tina\u0027s eyes were glued to the ring on her right hand as she said, \"Nothing. It didn\u0027t do anything. So it\u0027s true?\"\\n\\n \"Ask me again,\" Mr Solomon said.\\n\\n \"Do you have a girlfriend?\"\\n\\n This time Mr. Solomon said, \"Yes.\" A moment later Tina was shaking her hand like it had fallen asleep or something. \"It\u0027s not broken, Ms. Walters,\" Mr. Solomon said knowingly. \"It\u0027s just not as good at detecting lies as I am at telling them.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t help myself; I glanced at Zach, who caught me looking.\\n\\n \"Partner with the person across from you,\" Mr. Solomon said, and an uneasy feeling settled in my stomach. \"Watch their eyes, pay attention to their voice. And see if you can guess who\u0027s lying.\"\\n\\n I know I\u0027m not the first girl in history who\u0027d ever had that mission, but I felt like there\u0027d never been so much riding on it. \"Oh,\" Zach said with a quick raise of his eyebrows, \"this should be fun.\" I didn\u0027t need the ring on my finger to tell me he totally wasn\u0027t lying.\\n\\n I started coming up with reasons I could be excused from the lecture, but no one had been exposed to plutonium since the mid-1990s, so I was stuck. With Zach. And my fibbing ability was about to be tested more than it ever had been before.\\n\\n \"What is your name?\" I asked, thinking back to that cold, sterile room beneath the mall in D.C. and the way a professional had gone about looking for the truth.\\n\\n \"Zach,\" he said.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s your full name?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a pretty boring question, Gallagher Girl.\"\\n\\n \"Zach!\"\\n\\n \"Yes, that\u0027s correct.\" He held up my right hand. \"See— not lying.\"\\n\\n \"Where were you during the Code Black?\"\\n\\n Zach broke out into a broad smile. \"That\u0027s better.\"\\n\\n \"Answer the—\"\\n\\n \"I was with you,\" he said. \"Remember?\" Then he leaned on the desk between us. \"My turn,\" he said, grinning like an idiot. \"Did you have fun last night?\"\\n\\n \"Zach, I really don\u0027t think that\u0027s what Mr. Solomon is going for with this particular exercise.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take that as a yes,\" Zach said. \"We should really do it again sometime.\"\\n\\n I looked at the ring on my hand, but it didn\u0027t do a thing. He was telling the truth. But I still didn\u0027t know what it meant.\\n\\n \"Where are you from?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"The Blackthorne Institute for Boys,\" he replied in a sing-song tune.\\n\\n \"What do your parents do?\" I asked, and for the first time he didn\u0027t respond. He didn\u0027t smirk. He didn\u0027t joke.\\n\\n He just straightened the notebook on his desk and asked, \"What do you think they do?\"\\n\\n I could hear Tina Walters asking Grant, \"So what\u0027s your idea of a perfect date?\" On the far side of the room, Courtney wanted to know what Eva really thought of Courtney\u0027s new haircut, but none of it seemed funny or interesting or cool at the moment.\\n\\n If the Gallagher Academy were to sell truth rings on the black market, every girl in America would line up to have one, but I didn\u0027t need the ring on my finger to tell me that Zach wasn\u0027t acting or lying or living out some legend then. There was a lot more to the story.\\n\\n \"They were CIA?\" I whispered.\\n\\n \"Used to be.\"\\n\\n But I didn\u0027t ask for details, because I knew they were classified; and I knew they were sad; and, most of all, now I knew Zach Goode was a little bit like me.\\n\\n Chapter Twenty-three\\n\\n It should have gone in the reports, of course. I should have told my friends. We\u0027d been searching for weeks for any clue, any sign, that these boys had pasts and histories—that they even existed at all. For one brief moment I had seen the real Zach—no covers, no legends, no lies. But as I walked through the dim, quiet corridors on Sunday night, I carried Zach\u0027s secret with me. I couldn\u0027t bring myself to set it down. \"Hey, kiddo,\" Mom called when she heard me enter the office. Smoke and steam rose from a small electric skillet behind her desk while the microwave hummed. When she came to hug me, I saw that she was wearing thick wool socks that were far too big for her—Dad\u0027s socks. She had on an old fraying sweatshirt that was rolled up at the sleeves—Dad\u0027s sweatshirt. And even though I\u0027d seen my mother in everything from ball gowns to business suits, I don\u0027t think I\u0027d ever seen her look more beautiful.\\n\\n \"Tonight,\" Mom announced happily, \"is taco night!\" I had to wonder if that was the same woman who had sat in this very room while the world went black around us, shrouded in shadows and the red glow of emergency lights. I knew I would never know all my mother\u0027s legends.\\n\\n \"How are your classes?\" she asked, as if she didn\u0027t know.\\n\\n \"Fine.\"\\n\\n \"How are the girls?\" she asked, as if she never saw them.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re great. Macey\u0027s getting bumped up to the ninth grade sciences classes.\"\\n\\n Mom smiled. \"I know.\"\\n\\n Everything was normal. Everything was good. Even the tacos looked halfway edible, but still I picked at my fingernails and shifted around on the couch. I watched my mother, who had wrapped herself in the last traces of my father, and said, \"How did you meet Dad?\"\\n\\n Mom stopped stirring whatever it was she\u0027d taken from the microwave. She forced a smile. \"What brought that on?\"\\n\\n I guess it was a pretty good question. After all, normal girls probably know their parents\u0027 story, but that\u0027s not necessarily true for spy girls—spy girls learn early that most things about their parents are classified.\\n\\n Still, I couldn\u0027t stop. \"Was it a mission? Did you meet when you were both working at Langley, or was it before that?\" I felt myself running out of breath. \"Did the Gallagher Academy do an exchange with Blackthorne then, too?\"\\n\\n Mom cocked her head and studied me as if I might be coming down with something. \"What makes you think your father went to the Blackthorne Institute?\"\\n\\n I thought about the picture but lied. \"I don\u0027t know. I guess I just…assumed. I mean, he did go there—didn\u0027t he?\"\\n\\n She looked down at the bowl and kept on stirring. \"No, sweetie. He had friends who went there. He guest-lectured on occasion. But your dad grew up in Nebraska—you know that.\"\\n\\n I did know that, but somehow in the last few months I\u0027d started questioning everything I\u0027d ever known.\\n\\n \"So how did you meet?\" I asked again. \"How did you know …\" I said, biting back the one question I really wanted to know but couldn\u0027t ask: How could you trust him? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-spy-gallagher-girls-2/page-22.html","bookId":2747,"book":{"id":2747,"title":"Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy (Gallagher Girls #2)","description":"Storyline: Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy (Gallagher Girls #2) \\n Cammie Morgan is back, and it\u0027s clear that her life hasn\u0027t calmed down since the events of I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You.
