{"id":83089,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"So right you are,\" Dr. Steve chimed from the front seat. \"As I was telling Headmistress Morgan just this—\" \"It\u0027s you and the street today,\" Mr. Solomon said, ignoring Dr. Steve. \"Today\u0027s test might be low tech, but this is trade craft at its most essential.\" He pulled a small box from beneath his seat, and I instantly recognized the cache of comms units and tiny cameras that were concealed within pins and earrings, tie clips and silver crosses exactly like the one I\u0027d worn last semester. \"Watch. Listen,\" Mr. Solomon said. \"Remember to communicate. Observe.\" Kim Lee was struggling to pin an American flag-pin-slash-camera onto her coat, and then Grant said, \"Allow me,\" and Kim batted her eyelashes and swooned a little (yes—actual swoonage) as he helped her. \"Pair off,\" Solomon continued his instructions as the van stopped. \"Blend in, and remember, we\u0027ll be watching.\" I looked at Bex and started for the doors, but before I could put a foot outside, Mr. Solomon said, \"Oh no, Ms. Morgan. I believe you already have a partner.\" It shouldn\u0027t have been that hard—not the brush passes, not the questions Mr. Solomon fired through our comms units at regular intervals. None of it. But as I climbed out of the van I knew this was going to be one of the toughest assignments I\u0027d ever been on. Because, for starters, at eleven a.m. on a Friday morning, there isn\u0027t a lot of pedestrian traffic on the town square in Roseville, Virginia, and everyone knows pedestrian traffic is key when trying to covertly pass something between two agents. Also, despite the bright sun and cloudless sky, it was still pretty cold outside, so I could either wear gloves and potentially inhibit my quarter-handling ability, or go gloveless and allow my hands to freeze. And, of course, there is the fact that your partner is your lifeline during covert operations, and at that moment, my partner was Zach. \"Come on, Gallagher Girl,\" he said as he headed for the square. \"This should be fun.\" But it didn\u0027t sound like fun—at all. Fun is movie marathons; fun is experimenting with fourteen kinds of ice cream and creating your own custom flavor. Fun is not hanging out in the place where I had met, kissed, and broken up with the world\u0027s sweetest boy. And participating in a clandestine training exercise with a different boy who wasn\u0027t sweet at all. The gazebo still stood in the center of the square. The movie theater was behind me, and the Abrams and Son Pharmacy—Josh\u0027s family\u0027s business—was exactly where it had been for seventy years. Things are supposed to look different when you come back, but despite the sight of my classmates walking two by two down sidewalks, everything was exactly as I\u0027d remembered. Not even the purses displayed in the Anderson\u0027s Accessories window had changed; for a second it felt like the past two months hadn\u0027t happened. \"So,\" Zach said as he stretched out on the steps of the gazebo, \"come here often?\" The loose stone where Josh and I had hidden our notes— my first dead-letter drop—was just a foot away so I shrugged and said, \"I used to, but then the deputy director of the CIA made me promise to stop.\" Zach laughed a quiet, half-laugh as he squinted up at me through the sun. In my earpiece, I heard Mr. Solomon say, \"Okay, Ms. Walters, you\u0027re it. Be aware of your casual observers, and let\u0027s make those passes quick and clean.\" I saw Tina and Eva walking past each other on the south side of the square; their palms brushed for a split second as the quarter passed between them. \"Well done,\" said Mr. Solomon. Zach tilted his head back, closed his eyes, and soaked in the sun as if he\u0027d been coming to that gazebo his whole life. \"So what about you?\" I asked, once the silence became too much. \"Exactly where does the Blackthorne Institute call home?\" \"Oh.\" He cocked an eyebrow. \"That\u0027s classified.\" I couldn\u0027t help myself: I got annoyed. \"So you can sleep inside the walls of my school, but I can\u0027t even know where yours is?\" Zach laughed again, but it was different this time, not mocking but deeper, as if I were on the outside of a joke I could never hope to understand. \"Trust me, Gallagher Girl, you wouldn\u0027t want to sleep in my school.\" Okay, I have to admit at that point my spy genetics and teenage curiosity were about to overwhelm me. Through my comms unit, I heard Mr. Solomon say, \"Two men are playing chess in the southwest corner of the square. How many moves from checkmate is the man in the green cap, Ms. Baxter?\" Bex replied \"Six\" without even breaking stride as she and Grant strolled along the opposite side of the street. \"What do you mean? Why can\u0027t you tell me?\" \"Just trust me, Gallagher Girl.\" He straightened on the gazebo steps, placed his elbows on his knees, and something more substantial than a quarter seemed to pass between us as he stared at me. \"Can you trust me?\" A torn and faded movie ticket blew across the grass. Mr. Solomon said, \"Ms. Morrison, you just passed three parked cars on Main Street; what were their tag numbers?\" and Mick rattled off her response. But Zach\u0027s gaze never left mine and I thought his question might have been the hardest of them all. In the reflection of the pharmacy window I saw Eva drop the quarter in the open bag at Courtney\u0027s feet while, through my comms unit, Mr. Solomon warned, \"There was an ATM behind you, Ms. Alvarez. ATMs equal cameras. Tighten it up, ladies.\" Zach nodded and said, \"Solomon\u0027s good.\" As if it didn\u0027t go without saying. \"Yeah. He is.\" \"They say you\u0027re good, too.\" And then, despite some very rigorous P\u0026E training, I think a feather could have knocked me over, because A) I had no idea who \"they\" were or where they got their information. And B) Even if it was reliable intel, I never dreamed Zachary Goode, of all people, would say so. \"Okay, Zach,\" Mr. Solomon said. \"Without turning around, tell me how many windows overlook the square from the west side.\" \"Fourteen.\" Zach didn\u0027t miss a beat. His eyes didn\u0027t leave me for a second. Then to me he said, \"They say you\u0027re a real pavement artist.\" Zach leaned back on the steps again. \"You know, it\u0027s probably a good thing we got to tail you in D.C. If you\u0027d been following me, I probably never would have seen you.\" It was supposed to be a compliment—I know it was. After all, for a spy, there\u0027s probably no higher praise. But right then, as I stood in the place where I\u0027d had my first date—my first kiss—I didn\u0027t hear it as a spy; I heard it as a girl. And for a girl, having a boy like Zach Goode tell you that he would never notice you isn\u0027t a compliment. At all. I should have said something sassy. I should have made a joke. I should have done anything but turn around and walk away from the gazebo and my partner and my mission. Bex and Grant veered onto the sidewalk and headed straight toward me. I felt Bex bump into me, heard her say \"I\u0027m sorry\" as her hand slid softly over my own. \"Nice pass, Ms. Baxter,\" Mr. Solomon said as I held the quarter in my palm. I turned down a side street on the far side of the square, passed the pharmacy, and thought for a second about the one boy who had seen me—once—and I wondered if life were just a series of brush passes—things come and go. Then I heard a familiar voice say, \"Cammie, is that you?\" Then I realized that sometimes things come back. Chapter Fourteen Josh. Josh was standing in front of me. Josh was stepping closer. Josh was looking at me, smiling at me. \"Hey, Cammie, I thought that was you.\" Now, I know I\u0027m new to this whole ex-girlfriend thing, but I\u0027m pretty sure exes aren\u0027t supposed to talk to each other. In fact, I\u0027m pretty sure exes are supposed to hide when they see each other, which totally sounded like a great idea to me, because, well, hiding\u0027s what I do best. But Josh had seen me. Josh always saw me. \"Cammie?\" Josh said again. \"Are you okay?\" I honestly didn\u0027t have a clue how to answer, because, on the one hand, Josh was there—talking to me! On the other hand, I had broken up with him. And lied to him. And the last time I\u0027d seen him he\u0027d shown up during a CoveOps exercise, driven a forklift through a wall, and had his memory modified, so okay wasn\u0027t necessarily the word the came to mind when describing how I felt right then. Spies are good at multitasking—we observe and we process, we calculate and we lie, but I didn\u0027t think it was possible to feel so happy, scared, and generally awkward all at the same time, so I muttered, \"Hi, Josh,\" and tried to keep my voice from cracking. \"What are you doing here?\" Josh asked, then looked up and down the narrow street as if he were being followed (which, when you think about it, wasn\u0027t all that far-fetched). \"Oh, it\u0027s a … school thing.\" At the word school, he recoiled slightly. I looked down at the uniform that—until that moment—Josh had never seen me wear. \"So, how have you been?\" \"Okay. How about you?\" \"Okay,\" I said, too, because, even though I could have told Josh a lot of things in a lot of different languages, the things I most wanted to say were the very things that neither the spy in me nor the girl in me could ever let him hear. \"So we\u0027re both okay,\" Josh said. He forced a smile. \"Good for us.\" Oh my gosh, could this moment be any more awkward, I thought—just as… you guessed it… the moment got a lot more awkward. \"Josh.\" The voice was soft and familiar. \"Josh, your dad said he could …\" The voice trailed off, and I saw one of Josh\u0027s oldest friends step out of the pharmacy\u0027s side door. DeeDee\u0027s short blond hair did a little flippy thing where it stuck out of the bottom of her pink hat. Which matched her pink scarf. And her pink mittens. Pink was definitely DeeDee\u0027s signature color. \"Oh my gosh, Cammie! It\u0027s great to see you!\" she exclaimed. She paused and studied my uniform for a second, as if remembering that almost everything I\u0027d told her last semester had been a lie. And then, despite everything, DeeDee hugged me. \"Hi, DeeDee,\" I said, forcing a smile. \"It\u0027s really … good … to see you, too.\" And it would have been if I hadn\u0027t noticed something just then that had nothing to do with being a spy on a training op and everything to do with being an ex-girlfriend. DeeDee and Josh were standing too straight and trying too hard not to touch. A panicked look passed between them that screamed, We\u0027ve been caught. And, Do you think she\u0027ll know? It didn\u0027t take a genius to look at them together—to know that Josh and DeeDee were no longer just friends. Spies don\u0027t train so that we\u0027ll always know what to think; we train so that in times like this we don\u0027t have to think; so that our bodies will go on cruise control and do the right things for us. My mouth smiled. My lungs kept breathing. I maintained cover, even when I heard Mr. Solomon\u0027s voice in my ear saying, \"Okay, Ms. Morgan, let\u0027s see you hand off.\" \"We\u0027re … I mean…I\u0027m…\" DeeDee corrected quickly, as if trying to hide the fact that in the past few weeks she\u0027d lost her single-pronoun status. \"I\u0027m on the committee for the spring fling—it\u0027s a dance…and you know…kind of a big deal…\" She was rambling, unsteadied, which is pretty common for people in deep cover for the first time. \"And Josh is helping me get businesses to donate door prizes and stuff. For the fling. Next Friday night. And—\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-spy-gallagher-girls-2/page-13.html","bookId":2747,"book":{"id":2747,"title":"Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy (Gallagher Girls #2)","description":"Storyline: Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy (Gallagher Girls #2) Cammie Morgan is back, and it\u0027s clear that her life hasn\u0027t calmed down since the events of I\u0027d Tell You I Love You, But Then I\u0027d Have to Kill You.
