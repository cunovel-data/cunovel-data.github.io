She\u0027d had a horrible dream: she had been given the vacuum flask she\u0027d seen her father, Lord Asriel, show to the Master and Scholars of Jordan College. When that had really happened, Lyra had been hiding in the wardrobe, and she\u0027d watched as Lord Asriel opened the flask to show the Scholars the severed head of Stanislaus Grumman, the lost explorer; but in her dream, Lyra had to open the flask herself, and she didn\u0027t want to. In fact, she was terrified. But she had to do it, whether she wanted to or not, and she felt her hands weakening with dread as she unclipped the lid and heard the air rash into the frozen chamber. Then she lifted the lid away, nearly choking with fear but knowing she had to - she had to do it. And there was nothing inside. The head had gone. There was nothing to be afraid of. But she awoke all the same, crying and sweating, in the hot little bedroom facing the harbor, with the moonlight streaming through the window, and lay in someone else\u0027s bed clutching someone else\u0027s pillow, with the ermine Pantalaimon nuzzling her and making soothing noises. Oh, she was so frightened! And how odd it was, that in real life she had been eager to see the head of Stanislaus Grumman, and had begged Lord Asriel to open the flask again and let her look, and yet in her dream she was so terrified. When morning came, she asked the alethiometer what the dream meant, but all it said was, It was a dream about a head. She thought of waking the strange boy, but he was so deeply asleep that she decided not to. Instead, she went down to the kitchen and tried to make an omelette, and twenty minutes later she sat down at a table on the pavement and ate the blackened, gritty thing with great pride while the sparrow Pantalaimon pecked at the bits of shell. She heard a sound behind her, and there was Will, heavy-eyed with sleep. \"I can make omelette,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll make you some if you like.\" He looked at her plate and said, \"No, I\u0027ll have some cereal. There\u0027s still some milk in the fridge that\u0027s all right. They can\u0027t have been gone very long, the people who lived here.\" She watched him shake corn flakes into a bowl and pour milk on them - something else she\u0027d never seen before. He carried the bowl outside and said, \"If you don\u0027t come from this world, where\u0027s your world? How did you get here?\" \"Over a bridge. My father made this bridge, and... I followed him across. But he\u0027s gone somewhere else, I don\u0027t know where. I don\u0027t care. But while I was walking across there was so much fog, and I got lost, I think. I walked around in the fog for days just eating berries and stuff I found. Then one day the fog cleared, and we was up on that cliff back there - \" She gestured behind her. Will looked along the shore, past the lighthouse, and saw the coast rising in a great series of cliffs that disappeared into the haze of the distance. \"And we saw the town here, and came down, but there was no one here. At least there were things to eat and beds to sleep in. We didn\u0027t know what to do next.\" \"You sure this isn\u0027t another part of your world?\" \"\u0027Course. This en\u0027t my world, I know that for certain.\" Will remembered his own absolute certainty, on seeing the patch of grass through the window in the air, that it wasn\u0027t in his world, and he nodded. \"So there\u0027s three worlds at least that are joined on,\" he said. \"There\u0027s millions and millions,\" Lyra said. \"This other daemon told me. He was a witch\u0027s daemon. No one can count how many worlds there are, all in the same space, but no one could get from one to another before my father made this bridge.\" \"What about the window I found?\" \"I dunno about that. Maybe all the worlds are starting to move into one another.\" \"And why are you looking for dust?\" She looked at him coldly. \"I might tell you sometime,\" she said. \"All right. But how are you going to look for it?\" \"I\u0027m going to find a Scholar who knows about it.\" \"What, any scholar?\" \"No. An experimental theologian,\" she said. \"In my Oxford, they were the ones who knew about it. Stands to reason it\u0027ll be the same in your Oxford. I\u0027ll go to Jordan College first, because Jordan had the best ones.\" \"I never heard of experimental theology,\" he said. \"They know all about elementary particles and fundamental forces,\" she explained. \"And anbaromagnetism, stuff like that. Atomcraft.\" \"What - magnetism?\" \"Anbaromagnetism. Like anbaric. Those lights,\" she said, pointing up at the ornamental streetlight. \"They\u0027re anbaric.\" \"We call them electric.\" \"Electric... that\u0027s like electrum. That\u0027s a kind of stone, a jewel, made out of gum from bees. There\u0027s insects in it, sometimes.\" \"You mean amber,\" he said, and they both said, \"Anbar...\" And each of them saw their own expression on the other\u0027s face. Will remembered that moment for a long time afterward. \"Well, electromagnetism,\" he went on, looking away. \"Sounds like what we call physics, your experimental theology. You want scientists, not theologians.\" \"Ah,\" she said warily. \"I\u0027ll find \u0027em.\" They sat in the wide clear morning, with the sun glittering placidly on the harbor, and each of them might have spoken next, because both of them were burning with questions; but then they heard a voice from farther along the harbor front, toward the casino gardens. Both of them looked there, startled. It was a child\u0027s voice, but there was no one in sight. Will said to Lyra quietly, \"How long did you say you\u0027d been here?\" \"Three days, four - I lost count. I never seen anyone. There\u0027s no one here. I looked almost everywhere.\" But there was. Two children, one a girl of Lyra\u0027s age and the other a younger boy, came out of one of the streets leading down to the harbor. They were carrying baskets, and both had red hair. They were about a hundred yards away when they saw Will and Lyra at the caf¨¦ table. Pantalaimon changed from a goldfinch to a mouse and ran up Lyra\u0027s arm to the pocket of her shirt. He\u0027d seen that these new children were like Will: neither of them had a daemon visible. The two children wandered up and sat at a table nearby. \"You from Ci\u0027gazze?\" the girl said. Will shook his head. \"From Sant\u0027Elia?\" \"No,\" said Lyra. \"We\u0027re from somewhere else.\" The girl nodded. This was a reasonable reply. \"What\u0027s happening?\" said Will. \"Where are the grownups?\" The girl\u0027s eyes narrowed. \"Didn\u0027t the Specters come to your city?\" she said. \"No,\" Will said. \"We just got here. We don\u0027t know about Specters. What is this city called?\" \"Ci\u0027gazze,\" the girl said suspiciously. \"Cittagazze, all right.\" \"Cittagazze,\" Lyra repeated. \"Ci\u0027gazze. Why do the grown-ups have to leave?\" \"Because of the Specters,\" the girl said with weary scorn. \"What\u0027s your name?\" \"Lyra. And he\u0027s Will. What\u0027s yours?\" \"Angelica. My brother is Paolo.\" \"Where\u0027ve you come from?\" \"Up the hills. There was a big fog and storm and everyone was frightened, so we all run up in the hills. Then when the fog cleared, the grownups could see with telescopes that the city was full of Specters, so they couldn\u0027t come back. But the kids, we ain\u0027 afraid of Specters, all right. There\u0027s more kids coming down. They be here later, but we\u0027re first.\" \"Us and Tullio,\" said little Paolo proudly. \"Who\u0027s Tullio?\" Angelica was cross: Paolo shouldn\u0027t have mentioned him, but the secret was out now. \"Our big brother,\" she said. \"He ain\u0027 with us. He\u0027s hiding till he can... He\u0027s just hiding.\" \"He\u0027s gonna get - \" Paolo began, but Angelica smacked him hard, and he shut his mouth at once, pressing his quivering lips together. \"What did you say about the city?\" said Will. \"It\u0027s full of Specters?\" \"Yeah, Ci\u0027gazze, Sant\u0027Elia, all cities. The Specters go where the people are. Where you from?\" \"Winchester,\" said Will. \"I never heard of it. They ain\u0027 got Specters there?\" \"No. I can\u0027t see any here, either.\" \"\u0027Course not!\" she crowed. \"You ain\u0027 grown up! When we grow up, we see Specters.\" \"I ain\u0027 afraid of Specters, all right,\" the little boy said, thrusting forward his grubby chin. \"Kill the buggers.\" \"En\u0027t the grownups going to come back at all?\" said Lyra. \"Yeah, in a few days,\" said Angelica. \"When the Specters go somewhere else. We like it when the Specters come, \u0027cause we can run about in the city, do what we like, all right.\" \"But what do the grownups think the Specters will do to them?\" Will said. \"Well, when a Specter catch a grownup, that\u0027s bad to see. They eat the life out of them there and then, all right. I don\u0027t want to be grown up, for sure. At first they know it\u0027s happening, and they\u0027re afraid; they cry and cry. They try and look away and pretend it ain\u0027 happening, but it is. It\u0027s too late. And no one ain\u0027 gonna go near them, they on they own. Then they get pale and they stop moving. They still alive, but it\u0027s like they been eaten from inside. You look in they eyes, you see the back of they heads. Ain\u0027 nothing there.\" The girl turned to her brother and wiped his nose on the sleeve of his shirt. \"Me and Paolo\u0027s going to look for ice creams,\" she said. \"You want to come and find some?\" \"No,\" said Will, \"we got something else to do.\" \"Good-bye, then,\" she said, and Paolo said, \"Kill the Specters!\" \"Good-bye,\" said Lyra. As soon as Angelica and the little boy had vanished, Pantalaimon appeared from Lyra\u0027s pocket, his mouse head ruffled and bright-eyed. He said to Will, \"They don\u0027t know about this window you found.\" It was the first time Will had heard him speak, and he was almost more startled by that than by anything else he\u0027d seen so far. Lyra laughed at his astonishment. \"He - but he spoke! Do all daemons talk?\" Will said. \"\u0027Course they do!\" said Lyra. \"Did you think he was just a pet?\" Will rubbed his hair and blinked. Then he shook his head. \"No,\" he said, addressing Pantalaimon. \"You\u0027re right, I think. They don\u0027t know about it.\" \"So we better be careful how we go through,\" Pantalaimon said. It was strange for only a moment, talking to a mouse. Then it was no more strange than talking into a telephone, because he was really talking to Lyra. But the mouse was separate; there was something of Lyra in his expression, but something else too. It was too hard to work out, when there were so many strange things happening at once. Will tried to bring his thoughts together. \"You got to find some other clothes first,\" he said to Lyra, \"before you go into my Oxford.\" \"Why?\" she said stubbornly. \"Because you can\u0027t go and talk to people in my world looking like that; they wouldn\u0027t let you near them. You got to look as if you fit in. You got to go about camouflaged. I know, see. I\u0027ve been doing it for years. You better listen to me or you\u0027ll get caught, and if they find out where you come from, and the window, and everything... Well, this is a good hiding place, this world. See, I\u0027m... I got to hide from some men. This is the best hiding place I could dream of, and I don\u0027t want it found out. So I don\u0027t want you giving it away by looking out of place or as if you don\u0027t belong. I got my own things to do in Oxford, and if you give me away, I\u0027ll kill you.\" She swallowed. The alethiometer never lied: this boy was a murderer, and if he\u0027d killed before, he could kill her, too. She nodded seriously, and she meant it. \"All right,\" she said. Pantalaimon had become a lemur, and was gazing at him with disconcerting wide eyes. Will stared back, and the daemon became a mouse once more and crept into Lyra\u0027s pocket. \"Good,\" he said. \"Now, while we\u0027re here, we\u0027ll pretend to these other kids that we just come from somewhere in their world. It\u0027s good there aren\u0027t any grownups about. We can just come and go and no one\u0027ll notice. But in my world, you got to do as I say. And the first thing is you better wash yourself. You need to look clean, or you\u0027ll stand out. We got to be camouflaged everywhere we go. We got to look as if we belong there so naturally that people don\u0027t even notice us. So go and wash your hair for a start. There\u0027s some shampoo in the bathroom. Then we\u0027ll go and find some different clothes.\" \"I dunno how,\" she said. \"I never washed my hair. The housekeeper done it at Jordan, and then I never needed to after that.\" \"Well, you\u0027ll just have to work it out,\" he said. \"Wash yourself all over. In my world people are clean.\" \"Hmm,\" said Lyra, and went upstairs. A ferocious rat face glared at him over her shoulder, but he looked back coldly. Part of him wanted to wander about this sunny silent morning exploring the city, and another part trembled with anxiety for his mother, and another part was still numb with shock at the death he\u0027d caused. And overhanging them all was the task he had to do. But it was good to keep busy, so while he waited for Lyra, he cleaned the working surfaces in the kitchen, and washed the floor, and emptied the rubbish into the bin he found in the alley outside. Then he took the green leather writing case from his tote bag and looked at it longingly. As soon as he\u0027d shown Lyra how to get through the window into his Oxford, he\u0027d come back and look at what was inside; but in the meanwhile, he tucked it under the mattress of the bed he\u0027d slept in. In this world, it was safe. When Lyra came down, clean and wet, they left to look for some clothes for her. They found a department store, shabby like everywhere else, with clothes in styles that looked a little old-fashioned to Will\u0027s eye, but they found Lyra a tartan skirt and a green sleeveless blouse with a pocket for Pantalaimon. She refused to wear jeans, refused even to believe Will when he told her that most girls did. \"They\u0027re trousers,\" she said. \"I\u0027m a girl. Don\u0027t be stupid.\" He shrugged; the tartan skirt looked unremarkable, which was the main thing. Before they left, Will dropped some coins in the till behind the counter. \"What you doing?\" she said. \"Paying. You have to pay for things. Don\u0027t they pay for things in your world?\" \"They don\u0027t in this one! I bet those other kids en\u0027t paying for a thing.\" \"They might not, but I do.\" \"If you start behaving like a grownup, the Specters\u0027ll get you,\" she said, but she didn\u0027t know whether she could tease him yet or whether she should be afraid of him. In the daylight, Will could see how ancient the buildings in the heart of the city were, and how near to ruin some of them had come. Holes in the road had not been repaired; windows were broken; plaster was peeling. And yet there had once been a beauty and grandeur about this place. Through carved archways they could see spacious courtyards filled with greenery, and there were great buildings that looked like palaces, for all that the steps were cracked and the doorframes loose from the walls. It looked as if rather than knock a building down and build a new one, the citizens of Ci\u0027gazze preferred to patch it up indefinitely. At one point they came to a tower standing on its own in a little square. It was the oldest building they\u0027d seen: a simple battlemented tower four stories high. Something about its stillness in the bright sun was intriguing, and both Will and Lyra felt drawn to the half-open door at the top of the broad steps; but they didn\u0027t speak of it, and they went on, a bit reluctantly. When they reached the broad boulevard with the palm trees, he told her to look for a little caf¨¦ on a corner, with green-painted metal tables on the pavement outside. They found it within a minute. It looked smaller and shabbier by daylight, but it was the same place, with the zinc-topped bar, the espresso machine, and the half-finished plate of risotto, now beginning to smell bad in the warm air. \"Is it in here?\" she said. \"No. It\u0027s in the middle of the road. Make sure there\u0027s no other kids around.\" But they were alone. Will took her to the grassy median under the palm trees, and looked around to get his bearings. \"I think it was about here,\" he said. \"When I came through, I could just about see that big hill behind the white house up there, and looking this way there was the caf¨¦ there, and...\" \"What\u0027s it look like? I can\u0027t see anything.\" \"You won\u0027t mistake it. It doesn\u0027t look like anything you\u0027ve ever seen.\" He cast up and down. Had it vanished? Had it closed? He couldn\u0027t see it anywhere. And then suddenly he had it. He moved back and forth, watching the edge. Just as he\u0027d found the night before, on the Oxford side of it, you could only see it at all from one side: when you moved behind it, it was invisible. And the sun on the grass beyond it was just like the sun on the grass on this side, except unaccountably different. \"Here it is,\" he said when he was sure. \"Ah! I see it!\" She was agog, she looked as astounded as he\u0027d looked himself to hear Pantalaimon talk. Her daemon, unable to remain inside her pocket, had come out to be a wasp, and he buzzed up to the hole and back several times, while she rubbed her still slightly wet hair into spikes. \"Keep to one side,\" he told her. \"If you stand in front of it people\u0027d just see a pair of legs, and that would make \u0027em curious. I don\u0027t want anyone noticing.\" \"What\u0027s that noise?\" \"Traffic. It\u0027s a part of the Oxford ring road. It\u0027s bound to be busy. Get down and look at it from the side. It\u0027s the wrong time of day to go through, really; there\u0027s far too many people about. But it\u0027d be hard to find somewhere to go if we went in the middle of the night. At least once we\u0027re through we can blend in easy. You go first. Just duck through quickly and move out of the way.\" She had a little blue rucksack that she\u0027d been carrying since they left the caf¨¦, and she unslung it and held it in her arms before crouching to look through. \"Ah!\" She gasped. \"And that\u0027s your world? That don\u0027t look like any part of Oxford. You sure you was in Oxford?\" \"\u0027Course I\u0027m sure. When you go through, you\u0027ll see a road right in front of you. Go to the left, and then a little farther along you take the road that goes down to the right. That leads to the city center. Make sure you can see where this window is, and remember, all right? It\u0027s the only way back.\" \"Right,\" she said. \"I won\u0027t forget.\" Taking her rucksack in her arms, she ducked through the window in the air and vanished. Will crouched down to see where she went. And there she was, standing on the grass in his Oxford with Pan still as a wasp on her shoulder, and no one, as far as he could tell, had seen her appear. Cars and trucks raced past a few feet beyond, and no driver, at this busy junction, would have time to gaze sideways at an odd-looking bit of air, even if they could see it, and the traffic screened the window from anyone looking across from the far side. There was a squeal of brakes, a shout, a bang. He flung himself down to look. Lyra was lying on the grass. A car had braked so hard that a van had struck it from behind, and knocked the car forward anyway, and there was Lyra, lying still - Will darted through after her. No one saw him come; all eyes were on the car, the crumpled bumper, the van driver getting out, and on the little girl. \"I couldn\u0027t help it! She ran out in front,\" said the car driver, a middle-aged woman. \"You were too close,\" she said, turning toward the van driver. \"Never mind that,\" he said. \"How\u0027s the kid?\" The van driver was addressing Will, who was on his knees beside Lyra. Will looked up and around, but there was nothing for it; he was responsible. On the grass next to him, Lyra was moving her head about, blinking hard. Will saw the wasp Pantalaimon crawling dazedly up a grass stem beside her. \"You all right?\" Will said. \"Move your legs and arms.\" \"Stupid!\" said the woman from the car. \"Just ran out in front. Didn\u0027t look once. What am I supposed to do?\" \"You still there, love?\" said the van driver. \"Yeah,\" muttered Lyra. \"Everything working?\" \"Move your feet and hands,\" Will insisted. She did. There was nothing broken. \"She\u0027s all right,\" said Will. \"I\u0027ll look after her. She\u0027s fine.\" \"D\u0027you know her?\" said the truck driver. \"She\u0027s my sister,\" said Will. \"It\u0027s all right. We just live around the corner. I\u0027ll take her home.\" Lyra was sitting up now, and as she was obviously not badly hurt, the woman turned her attention back to the car. The rest of the traffic was moving around the two stationary vehicles, and as they went past, the drivers looked curiously at the little scene, as people always do. Will helped Lyra up; the sooner they moved away, the better. The woman and the van driver had realized that their argument ought to be handled by their insurance companies and were exchanging addresses when the woman saw Will helping Lyra to limp away. \"Wait!\" she called. \"You\u0027ll be witnesses. I need your name and address.\" \"I\u0027m Mark Ransom,\" said Will, turning back, \"and my sister\u0027s Lisa. We live at twenty-six Bourne Close.\" \"Postcode?\" \"I can never remember,\" he said. \"Look, I want to get her home.\" \"Hop in the cab,\" said the van driver, \"and I\u0027ll take you round.\" \"No, it\u0027s no trouble. It\u0027d be quicker to walk, honest.\" Lyra wasn\u0027t limping badly. She walked away with Will, back along the grass under the hornbeam trees, and turned at the first corner they came to. They sat on a low garden wall. \"You hurt?\" Will said. \"Banged me leg. And when I fell down, it shook me head,\" she said. But she was more concerned about what was in the rucksack. She felt inside it, brought out a heavy little bundle wrapped in black velvet, and unfolded it. Will\u0027s eyes widened to see the alethiometer; the tiny symbols painted around the face, the golden hands, the questing needle, the heavy richness of the case took his breath away. \"What\u0027s that?\" he said. \"It\u0027s my alethiometer. It\u0027s a truth teller. A symbol reader. I hope it en\u0027t broken...\" But it was unharmed. Even in her trembling hands the long needle swung steadily. She put it away and said, \"I never seen so many carts and things. I never guessed they was going so fast.\" \"They don\u0027t have cars and vans in your Oxford?\" \"Not so many. Not like these ones. I wasn\u0027t used to it. But I\u0027m all right now.\" \"Well, be careful from now on. If you go and walk under a bus or get lost or something, they\u0027ll realize you\u0027re not from this world and start looking for the way through...\" He was far more angry than he needed to be. Finally he said, \"All right, look. If you pretend you\u0027re my sister, that\u0027ll be a disguise for me, because the person they\u0027re looking for hasn\u0027t got a sister. And if I\u0027m with you, I can show you how to cross roads without getting killed.\" \"All right,\" she said humbly. \"And money. I bet you haven\u0027t - well, how could you have any money? How are you going to get around and eat and so on?\" \"I have got money,\" she said, and shook some gold coins out of her purse. Will looked at them incredulously. \"Is that gold? It is, isn\u0027t it? Well, that would get people asking questions, and no mistake. You\u0027re just not safe. I\u0027ll give you some money. Put those coins away and keep them out of sight. And remember - you\u0027re my sister, and your name\u0027s Lisa Ransom.\" \"Lizzie. I pretended to call myself Lizzie before. I can remember that.\" \"All right, Lizzie then. And I\u0027m Mark. Don\u0027t forget.\" \"All right,\" she said peaceably. Her leg was going to be painful; already it was red and swollen where the car had struck it, and a dark, massive bruise was forming. What with the bruise on her cheek where he\u0027d struck her the night before, she looked as if she\u0027d been badly treated, and that worried him too - suppose some police officer should become curious? He tried to put it out of his mind, and they set off together, crossing at the traffic lights and casting just one glance back at the window under the hornbeam trees. They couldn\u0027t see it at all. It was quite invisible, and the traffic was flowing again. In Summertown, ten minutes\u0027 walk down the Banbury Road, Will stopped in front of a bank. \"What are you doing?\" said Lyra. \"I\u0027m going to get some money. I probably better not do it too often, but they won\u0027t register it till the end of the working day, I shouldn\u0027t think.\" He put his mother\u0027s bank card into the automatic teller and tapped out her PIN number. Nothing seemed to be going wrong, so he withdrew a hundred pounds, and the machine gave it up without a hitch. Lyra watched open-mouthed. He gave her a twenty-pound note. \"Use that later,\" he said. \"Buy something and get some change. Let\u0027s find a bus into town.\" Lyra let him deal with the bus. She sat very quietly, watching the houses and gardens of the city that was hers and not hers. It was like being in someone else\u0027s dream. They got off in the city center next to an old stone church, which she did know, opposite a big department store, which she didn\u0027t. \"It\u0027s all changed,\" she said. \"Like... That en\u0027t the Corn-market? And this is the Broad. There\u0027s Balliol. And Bodley\u0027s Library, down there. But where\u0027s Jordan?\" Now she was trembling badly. It might have been delayed reaction from the accident, or present shock from finding an entirely different building in place of the Jordan College she knew as home. \"That en\u0027t right,\" she said. She spoke quietly, because Will had told her to stop pointing out so loudly the things that were wrong. \"This is a different Oxford.\" \"Well, we knew that,\" he said. He wasn\u0027t prepared for Lyra\u0027s wide-eyed helplessness. He couldn\u0027t know how much of her childhood had been spent running about streets almost identical with these, and how proud she\u0027d been of belonging to Jordan College, whose Scholars were the cleverest, whose coffers the richest, whose beauty the most splendid of all. And now it simply wasn\u0027t there, and she wasn\u0027t Lyra of Jordan anymore; she was a lost little girl in a strange world, belonging nowhere. \"Well,\" she said shakily. \"If it en\u0027t here...\" It was going to take longer than she\u0027d thought, that was all.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-subtle-knife-his-dark-materials-2/page-3.html","bookId":2092,"book":{"id":2092,"title":"The Subtle Knife (His Dark Materials #2)","description":"Storyline: The Subtle Knife(His Dark Materials 2) The Subtle Knife, the second novel in the book His Dark Materials series, was written by English novelist Philip Pullman and published in 1997. The novel continues the adventures of Lyra Belacqua as she investigates the mysterious Dust phenomenon and searches for her father. Will Parry is introduced as a companion to Lyra, and together they explore the new realms to which they have both been introduced. The book focuses more on the characters and their own individual plots, rather than just on Lyra\u0027s father, Lord Asriel, and his war against the Magisterium. It describes not only Lyra and Will\u0027s journey, but also the journeys of Lee Scoresby and Serafina Pekkala. In addition, Pullman alludes heavily to the study of dark matter (or \"Dust\") and particle physics to further establish his metaphysical saga.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-subtle-knife-his-dark-materials-2.jpg","author":"Philip Pullman","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-subtle-knife-his-dark-materials-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:20 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:40:33 PM"}}
