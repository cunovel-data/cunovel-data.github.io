{"id":13554,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I THE HOUSE IN THE PINE WOOD","content":"\"We had better lie down and die,\" said Robin peevishly. \"I can\u0027t go a step further,\" and to emphasise his words he deliberately sat. \n \n \"Infernal little duffer,\" growled Herrick. \"Huh! Might have guessed you would Joyce.\" He threw himself down beside his companion and continued grumbling. \"You have tobacco, a fine night, and a heather couch of the finest, yet you talk as though the world were coming to an end.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m sure this moor never will,\" sighed Joyce, reminded of his cigarettes, \"we have been trudging it since eight in the morning, yet it still stretches to the back-of-beyond. Hai!\" \n \n The pedestrians were pronouncedly isolated. A moonless sky thickly jewelled with stars, arched over a treeless moor, far-stretching as the plain of Shinar. In the luminous summer twilight, the eye could see for a moderate distance, but to no clearly defined horizon; and the verge of sight was limited by vague shadows, hardly definite enough to be mists. \n \n The moor exhaled the noonday heats in thin white vapour, which shut out from the external world those who nestled to its bosom. A sense of solitude, the brooding silence, the formless surroundings, and above all, the insistence of the infinite, would have appealed on ordinary occasions to the poetical and superstitious side of Robin\u0027s nature. But at the moment, his nerves were uppermost. He was worn-out, fractious as a child, and in his helplessness could have cried like one. Herrick knew his friend\u0027s frail physique and inherited neurosis: therefore he forebore to make bad worse by ill advised sympathy. Judiciously waiting until Joyce had in some degree soothed himself with tobacco, he talked of the common-place. \n \n \"Nine o\u0027clock,\" said he peering at his watch; \"thirteen hour\u0027s walking. Nothing to me Robin, but a goodish stretch to you. However we are within hail of civilization, and in England. A few miles further we\u0027ll pick up a village of sorts no doubt. One would think you were exploiting Africa the way you howl.\" \n \n He spoke thus callously, in order to brace his friend; but Joyce resented the tone with that exaggerated sense of injury peculiar to the neurotic. \"I am no Hercules like you Jim,\" he protested sullenly; \"all your finer feelings have been blunted by beef and beer. You can\u0027t feel things as I do. Also,\" continued Robin still more querulously, \"it seems to have escaped your memory, that I returned only last night from a two day\u0027s visit to Town.\" \n \n \"If you _will_ break up your holiday into fragments, you must not expect to receive the benefit its enjoyment as a whole would give you. It was jolly enough last week sauntering through the Midlands, till you larked up to London, and fagged yourself with its detestable civilization.\" \n \n Joyce threw aside his cigarette and nervously began to roll another. \"It was no lark which took me up Jim. The letter that came to the Southberry Inn was about--her business.\" \n \n \"Sorry old man. I keep forgetting your troubles. Heat and the want of food make me savage. We\u0027ll rest here for a time, and then push on. Not that a night in the open would matter to me.\" \n \n Joyce made no reply but lying full length on the dry herbage, stared at the scintillating sky. At his elbow, Herrick, cross-legged like a fakir, gave himself up to the enjoyment of a disreputable pipe. The more highly-strung man considered the circumstances which had placed him where he was. \n \n Two months previously, Robin Joyce had lost his mother, to whom he had been devotedly attached: and the consequent grief had made a wreck of him. For weeks he had shut himself up in the flat once brightened by her presence to luxuriate in woe. He possessed in a large degree that instinct for martyrdom, latent in many people, which searches for sorrow, as a more joyous nature hunts for pleasure. The blow of Mrs. Joyce\u0027s death had fallen unexpectedly, but it brought home to Robin, the knowledge--strange as it may sound--that a mental pleasure can be plucked from misfortune. He locked himself in his room, wept much, and ate little; neglected his business of contributor to several newspapers, and his personal appearance. Thus the pain of his loss merged itself in that delight of self-mortification, which must have been experienced by the hermits of the Thebiad. Not entirely from religious motives was the desert made populous with hermits in the days of Cyril and Hypatia. \n \n Herrick did not realize this transcendental indulgence, nor would he have understood it, had he done so. Emphatically a sane man, he would have deemed it a weakness degrading to the will, if not a species of lunacy. As it was, he merely saw that Robin yielded to an unrestrained grief detrimental to his health, and insisted upon carrying him off for a spell in the open air. With less trouble than he anticipated, Robin\u0027s consent was obtained. The mourner threw himself with ardour into the scheme, selected the county of Berks as the most inviting for a ramble; and when fairly started, showed a power of endurance amazing in one so frail. \n \n Jim however being a doctor, was less astonished than a layman would have been. He knew that in Joyce a tremendous nerve power dominated the feebler muscular force, and that the man would go on like a blood-horse until he dropped from sheer exhaustion. The collapse on the moor did not surprise him. He only wondered that Robin had held out for so many days. \n \n \"But I wish you had not gone to London,\" said Herrick pursuing aloud this train of thought. \n \n \"I had to go,\" replied Joyce not troubling to query the remark. \"The lawyer wrote about my poor mother\u0027s property. In my sorrow, I had neglected to look after it, but at Southberry Junction feeling better, thanks to your open air cure, I thought it wise to attend to the matter.\" \n \n Then Joyce went on to state with much detail, how he had caught the Paddington express at Marleigh--their last stopping place--and had seen his lawyer. The business took some time to settle; but it resulted in the knowledge that Joyce found himself possessed of five hundred a year in Consols. \"Also the flat and the furniture,\" said Robin, \"so I am not so badly off. I can devote myself wholly to novels now, and shall not have to rack my brains for newspaper articles.\" \n \n Herrick nodded over a newly-filled pipe. \"Did you sleep at the flat?\" \n \n \"No, I went up on Tuesday as you know, and slept that night at the Hull Hotel, a small house in one of the Strand side streets. Last night, I joined you at Southberry.\" \n \n \"And it is now Thursday,\" said Herrick laughing. \"How particular you are as to detail Robin. Well, Southberry is a goodish way behind us now and Saxham is our next resting place. Feel better?\" \n \n \"Yes, thanks. In another quarter of an hour, I shall make the attempt to reach Saxham. But we are so late, I fear no bed----\" \n \n \"Oh, that\u0027s alright. We can wake the landlord, I calculate we have only three miles.\" \n \n \"Quite enough too. By the way Jim, what did you do, when I left you?\" \n \n In the semi-darkness Herrick chuckled. \"Fell in love!\" said he. \n \n \"H\u0027m! You lost no time about it. And she?\" \n \n \"A daughter of the gods, divinely tall; dark hair, creamy skin, sea-blue eyes the figure and gait of Diana, and--\" \n \n \"More of the Celt than the Greek,\" interrupted Joyce, \"blue eyes, black hair, that is the Irish type. Where did you see her?\" \n \n \"In Southberry Church, talking to a puny curate, who did not deserve such a companion. Oh, Robin, her voice! like an Eolian harp.\" \n \n \"It must possess a variety of tones then Jim. Did she see you?\" \n \n Herrick nodded and laughed again. \"She looked and blushed. Beauty drew me with a single hair, therefore I thrilled responsive. Love at first sight Robin. Heigh-ho! never again shall I see this Helen of Marleigh.\" \n \n \"Live in hope,\" said Joyce, springing to his feet. \"Allons, mon ami.\" \n \n The more leisurely Herrick rose, markedly surprised at this sudden recuperation. \"Wonderful man. One minute you are dying, the next skipping like a two year old. Hysterical all the same,\" he added as Joyce laughed. \n \n \"Those three miles,\" explained the other feverishly, \"I feel that I have to walk them, and my determination is braced to breaking point.\" \n \n \"That means you\u0027ll collapse half way,\" retorted the doctor unstrapping his knapsack. \"Light a match. Valerian for you my man.\" \n \n Robin made no objection. He knew the value of Valerian for those unruly nerves of his, at present vibrating like so many harp-strings, twangled by an unskilful player. His small white face looked smaller and whiter than ever in the faint light of the match; but his great black eyes flamed like wind-blown torches. The contrast of Herrick\u0027s sun-tanned Saxon looks, struck him as almost ludicrous. Joyce needed no mirror to assure him of his appearance at the moment. He knew only too well how he aged on the eve of a nerve storm. For the present it was averted by the valerian; but he knew and so did Herrick, that sooner or later it would surely come. \n \n \"We must get on as fast as possible,\" said Herrick, the knapsack again on his broad back. \"Food, drink, rest; you need all three. Forward!\" \n \n For some time they walked on in silence. Robin was so small, Dr. Jim so large, that they looked like the giant and dwarf of the old fairy tale on their travels. But in this case it was the giant who did all the work. Joyce was a pampered, lazy, irresponsible child, in the direct line of descent from Harold Skimpole. If Jim Herrick must be likened to another hero of romance, Amyas Leigh was his prototype. \n \n The shadows melted before them, and closed in behind, and still there was nothing but plain and mist. At the end of two miles a dark bulk like a thunder-cloud, loomed before them. It stretched directly across their path. \"Bogey,\" laughed Robin. \n \n \"A wood,\" said the more prosaic Jim, \"this moor is fringed with pine-woods: remember the forest we passed through this morning.\" \n \n \"In the cheerful sunshine,\" shuddered Joyce. \"I don\u0027t like woodlands by night. The fairies are about and goblins of the worst. Ha! Yonder the lantern of Puck. Oberon holds revel in the wood.\" \n \n \"Puck must be putting a girdle round the earth then Robin,\" said Herrick and stared at the white starry light, which beamed above the trees. \n \n \"Hecate\u0027s torch,\" cried Joyce, \"a meeting of witches,\" and he began to chant the gruesome rhymes of the sisterhood, as Macbeth heard them. \"The scene is a blasted heath too,\" said he. \n \n By this time the moon was rising, and silver shafts struck inward to the heart of the pines. The aerial light vanished behind the leafy screen, as the travellers came to a halt on the verge of the undergrowth. \n \n \"We must get through,\" said Dr. Jim, \"or if you like Robin, we can skirt round. Saxham village is just beyond I fancy.\" \n \n \"Let us choose the bee-line,\" murmured Joyce. \"I want a bed and a meal as soon as possible. This part of the world is unknown to me. You lead.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know it myself. However here\u0027s a path. We\u0027ll follow it to the light. That comes from a tower of sorts. Too high up for a house.\" \n \n With Herrick as pioneer, they plunged into the wood, following a winding path. In the gloom, their heads came into contact with boughs and tree-trunks but occasionally the moon made radiant the secret recesses, and revealed unexpected openings. The path sometimes passed across a glade, on the sward of which Joyce declared he saw the fairies dancing: and anon plunged into a cimmerian gloom suggestive of the underworld. No wind swung the heavy pine-boughs; the wild creatures of the wood gave no sign, made no stir: yet the explorers heard a low persistent swish-swurr-swish, like the murmur of a dying breeze. It came from no particular direction, but droned on all sides without pause, without change of note. Herrick heard Robin\u0027s hysterical sob, as the insistent sound bored into his brain. He would have made some remark; but at the moment they emerged into a open space of considerable size. Here, ringed by pines, loomed a vast grey house, with a slim tower. In that tower burned the steady light outshining even the moon\u0027s lustre. But what was more remarkable still, was the illumination of the mansion. Every window radiated white fire. \n \n \"Queer,\" said Robin halting on the verge of the wood, \"not even a fence or a wall: a path or an outhouse. One would think that this was an inferior Aladdin\u0027s palace dropped here by some negligent genii. All ablaze too,\" he added wonderingly; \"the owner must be giving a ball.\" \n \n \"No signs of guests anyhow,\" returned Herrick as puzzled as his companion. \"H\u0027m! Queer thing to find Versailles in a pine wood. However it may afford us a bed and a supper.\" \n \n It was certainly strange. The circle of trees stopped short of the building at fifty yards. On all sides stretched an expanse of shorn and well-kept turf, pathless as the sea. In its midst the mansion was dropped--as Joyce aptly put it--unexpectedly. A two-storey Tudor building, with battlements, and mullioned windows, terraces and flights of shallow steps: the whole weather-worn and grey in the moonlight, over-grown with ivy, and distinctly ruinous. The dilapidated state of the house, contrasted in a rather sinister manner with the perfectly-kept lawn. Also another curious contrast, was the tower. This tacked on to the western corner, stood like a lean white ghost, watching over its earthly habitation. Its gleaming stone-work and sharp outlines showed that it had been built within the last decade. A distinct anachronism, which marred the quaint antiquity of the medi?val mansion. \n \n \"He must be an astrologer,\" said Joyce referring to the owner, \"or it may be that the tower is an inland pharos, to guide travellers across that pathless moor. A horrible place,\" he muttered. \n \n \"Why horrible?\" asked Dr. Jim as they crossed the lawn. \n \n Robin shuddered, and cast a backward glance. \"I can hardly explain. But to my mind, there is something sinister in this lonely mansion, ablaze with light, yet devoid of inhabitants.\" \n \n \"We have yet to find out if that is the case Robin. Hullo! the door is open,\" and in the strong moonlight they looked wonderingly at each other. \n \n The heavy door--oak, clamped with iron--was slightly ajar. Herrick bent upon consummating the adventure, pushed it slightly open. They beheld a large hall with a tesselated pavement, and stately columns. Between these last stood black oak high-backed chairs upholstered in red velvet: also statues of Greek gods and goddesses, holding aloft opaque globes, radiant with light. A vast marble staircase with wide and shallow steps, sloped upwards, and on either side of this, from the height of the landing fell scarlet velvet curtains, shutting in the hall. The whiteness of the marble, the crimson of the draperies, the brilliance of the light; these sumptuous furnishings amazed the dusty pedestrians. It was as though, on a lonely prairie, one should step suddenly into the splendours of the Vatican. \n \n \"The palace of the Sleeping Beauty,\" whispered the awe-struck Robin. \"Who can say romance is dead, when one can stumble upon such an adventure.\" \n \n Herrick shared Robin\u0027s perplexity: but of a more practical nature, he addressed himself less to the romance than to the reality. Seeing no one, hearing nothing, he touched an ivory button, that glimmered a white spot beside the door. Immediately a silvery succession of sounds, shrilled through the--apparently--lonely house. \"Electric bells, electric light. The hermit of this establishment is up-to-date.\" \n \n \"He is also deaf, and has no servants,\" said Joyce impatiently after a few minutes had passed. \"Has a Borgian banquet taken place here? The guests seem to be dead. Hai! the whole thing is damnable.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t let yourself go,\" said the doctor roughly squeezing the little man\u0027s arm, \"wait and see the upshot.\" \n \n Again and again they rang the bell, and themselves heard its imperative summons: but no one appeared. Then they took their courage in both hands, and stepped into the house. Passing through the crimson curtains, they found themselves in a wide corridor enamelled green, with velvet carpet and more light-bearing statues. On either side were doors draped with emerald silk. Herrick led the way through one of these, for Joyce, rendered timorous by the adventure would not take the initiative. \n \n In the first room, an oval table was set out for a solitary meal. The linen was bleached as the Alpine snow, the silver antique, the crystal exquisite, the porcelain worth its weight in gold. An iridescent glass vase in the centre was filled with flowers, but these drooped, withered and brown. The bread also was stale, the fruits were shrivelled from their early freshness. Magnificently furnished and draped, the room glowed in splendour, under innumerable electric lights. But the intruders had eyes only for that sumptuous table, with its air of desolation, and its place set for one. Anything more sinister can scarcely be conceived. \n \n \"No one has sat down to this meal,\" said Herrick lifting the covers of the silver dishes, \"it has stood here for hours, if not for days. Let us see if we can find the creature for whom it was intended.\" \n \n \"Perhaps you expect to find the Beast that loved Beauty, since you call him a creature,\" said Robin hysterically. \"Here is wine.\" \n \n Dr. Jim went to the sideboard, whereon were ranged decanters of Venetian glass containing many different vintages. Passing over these he selected a pint bottle of champagne. \"We must make free of our position,\" he said, unwiring this, \"afterwards we can apologise.\" \n \n \"Ugh!\" cried Robin as the cork popped with a staccato sound in the silence. \"How gruesome; give me a glass at once Jim.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know if it is good for you in your present state,\" replied the doctor brimming a goblet, \"however the whole adventure is so queer, that an attack of nerves is excusable. Drink up.\" \n \n Robin did so, and was joined by Jim. They finished the bottle, and felt exhilarated, and more ready to face the unknown. Again Herrick led the way to further explorations. Adjacent to the dining-room, they discovered a small kitchen, white-tiled and completely furnished. \"Our hermit cooks for himself,\" declared Dr. Jim, eying the utensils of polished copper. \"This is not a servant\u0027s kitchen: also it is off the dining-room.\" \n \n Robin made no reply, but followed his friend, his large eyes becoming larger at every fresh discovery. They entered a drawing-room filled with splendid furniture, silver knick-knacks, costly china, and Eastern hangings of great price. There was a library stored with books in magnificent bindings, and with tables piled with latter-day magazines, novels and newspapers. \"Our hermit keeps himself abreast of the world,\" commented Jim. \n \n Then came a picture gallery, but this was on a second storey and lighted from the roof. Treasures of art ancient and modern glowed here under the radiance of the light, which illuminated every room. A smoking-room fashioned like a ship\u0027s cabin: a Japanese apartment, crammed with the lacquer work, and stiff embroideries of Yeddo and Yokahama; a shooting gallery; a bowling alley; a music room, containing a magnificent Erard. Finally a dozen bedrooms furnished with taste and luxury. To crown all they discovered a gymnasium fitted up completely even to foils and boxing gloves: and a huge bathroom. This last was throughout of white marble, with a square pool of water in the centre. \"What a pond to bathe in!\" cried Jim enviously, for he was hot and dusty. \"Our hermit is an ancient Roman; he understands how to enjoy life. Come along Robin!\" \n \n But by this time they had explored almost the whole of the wonderful house. There remained the back premises, but on entering, they found nothing but darkness and dirt, squalor and coldness. The hermit\u0027s attention to his mansion stopped short at the servant\u0027s door. \"And I don\u0027t believe he has any servants,\" declared Joyce. \"How the deuce does he keep all this clean?\" \n \n The doctor shook his head. He hardly knew what to say. The situation was beyond him. A palace in the wilderness, with an open door inviting thieves! Crammed with treasures, brilliant with light, uninhabited, deserted. Was there ever anything so wonderful? He had to pinch himself to make sure that he was awake. \"We have got into the world of the fourth dimension: the fairy-land of the Arabian Nights. What do you think Joyce?\" \n \n \"I think we had better climb up to the tower,\" said Robin with unusual common sense, \"It is the only place we have left unexplored. There is a light there too; Aladdin may be aloft.\" \n \n Herrick shook his head. \"He would have heard the bell. However come along. We must find someone.\" \n \n With some difficulty they discovered the staircase leading to the tower. It was narrow but straight, and not so steep as might have been expected. At the top Herrick--leading as usual--was confronted by a closed door of plain deal. It was not locked however, and having knocked without receiving a reply he opened it. Joyce at his heels peeped over his shoulder and beheld a small square room with windows on all four sides, and a large central globe burning in the ceiling. In contrast to the rest of the house, this room was absolutely bare. Blank walls, Chinese matting on the floor, a camp bedstead in one corner, a deal table without a covering in another, and two cane chairs. No anchorite could have had a more ascetic cell. \n \n Herrick took in the scene at a glance, took in also, its--to him--central feature, the body of a man lying face downwards, near the bed. Joyce saw the corpse also, and remained at the door, shaking and white. \n \n \"Murder or suicide?\" Jim asked himself as he turned over the dead. \n \n That, which had once been a man, was in evening dress. In the finest of linen and jewellery, the most immaculate of clothes, it lay under the scrutinising eye of Dr. Herrick. A lean evil face, with a hook nose, scanty grey hair cut short and a long moustache carefully trimmed. The left hand gripped a revolver; the shirt front over the heart was covered with blood, and a stream, coagulated and black, streaked the matting. \n \n \"In God\u0027s name?\" cried Joyce not daring to enter, \"what is it?\" \n \n \"It was once the owner of this house I suppose,\" said Herrick grimly. \"Now, it is a piece of carrion. Suicide apparently. Dead over twenty-four hours. Shot through the heart. A steady hand to do that. H\u0027m, left-handed too. Is it suicide, or murder? Here\u0027s a damnable discovery to cap the adventure,\" said Dr. Jim gravely. \n \n From the doorway came a gasp, a tittering laugh. Jim had just time to spring forward when Joyce lunged into his arms. The long expected nerve-storm had come at last. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1878/54300.html","bookId":802,"book":{"id":802,"title":"The Silver Bullet","description":"简介： We had better lie down and die, said Robin peevishly.
