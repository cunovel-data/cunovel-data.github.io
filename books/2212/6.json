{"id":102892,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"FIVE\n IT WAS striking midnight when I reached Talbot Manor. It was as if I had never seen the place before. I had time now to roam the maze in the snow, and to study the pattern of clipped shrubbery, and imagine what the garden would be come spring. Beautiful old place.\n Then there were the close dark little rooms themselves, built to hold out the cold English winters, and the little lead-mullioned windows, many of which were full of light now, and most inviting in the snowy dark.\n David had finished his supper, obviously, and the servants- an old man and woman-were at work still in the kitchen belowstairs while the lord changed his clothes in his bedroom on the second floor.\n I watched him as he put on, over his pajamas, a long black dressing gown with black velvet lapels and sash that made him look very much like a cleric, though it was far too ornately patterned to be a cassock, especially with the white silk scarf tucked in at the neck.\n Then he made his way down the stairs.\n I entered by my favorite door at the end of the passage and came up beside him in the library as he bent to rake the fire.\n Ah, you did come back, he said, trying to conceal his delight, Good Lord, but you come and go so quietly!\n Yes, it\u0027s very annoying, isn\u0027t it? I looked at the Bible on the table, the copy of Faust, and the little short story by Lovecraft, still stapled, but smoothed out. There was David\u0027s decanter of Scotch also and a pretty thick-bottomed crystal glass.\n I stared at the short story, the memory of the anxious young man coming back to me. So odd the way he moved. A vague tremor passed through me at the thought of his having spotted me in three distinctly different places. I\u0027d probably never lay eyes on him again. On the other hand . . . But there was time to deal with this pest of a mortal. David was on my mind now, and the delicious awareness that we had the night to talk to each other.\n Wherever did you get those handsome clothes? David asked. His eyes passed over me slowly, lingeringly, and he seemed not to notice my attention to his books.\n Oh, a little shop somewhere. I never steal the garments of my victims, if that\u0027s what you mean. And besides, I\u0027m too addicted to lowlife and they don\u0027t dress well enough for that sort of thing.\n I settled in the chair opposite his, which was my chair now, I supposed. Deep, pliant leather, creaking springs, but very comfortable, with a high winged back and broad substantial arms. His own chair did not match it but was just as good, and a little more creased and worn.\n He stood before the flames, still studying me. Then he sat down too. He took the glass stopper from the crystal decanter, filled his glass, and lifted it in a little salute.\n He took a deep swallow and winced slightly as the liquid obviously warmed his throat.\n Suddenly, vividly, I remembered that particular sensation. I remembered being in the loft of the barn on my land in France, and drinking cognac just like that, and even making that grimace, and my mortal friend and lover, Nicki, snatching the bottle greedily from my hand.\n I see you are yourself again, David said with sudden warmth, lowering his voice slightly as he peered at me. He sat back, with the glass resting on the right arm of his chair. He looked very dignified, though far more at ease than I had ever seen him. His hair was thick and wavy, and had become a beautiful shade of dark gray.\n Do I seem myself? I asked.\n You have that mischievous look in your eye, he answered under his breath, still scanning me intently. There\u0027s a little smile on your lips. Won\u0027t leave for more than a second when you speak. And the skin-it makes a remarkable difference. I pray you\u0027re not in pain. You aren\u0027t, are you?\n I made a small dismissive gesture. I could hear his heartbeat. It was ever so slightly weaker than it had been in Amsterdam. Now and then it was irregular as well.\n How long will your skin stay dark like this? he asked.\n Years, perhaps, seems one of the ancient ones told me so. Didn\u0027t I write about it in The Queen of the Damned? I thought of Marius and how angry he was with me in genera!. How disapproving he would be of what I\u0027d done.\n It was Maharet, your ancient red-haired one, David said. In your book, she claimed to have done the very thing merely to darken her skin.\n What courage, I whispered. And you don\u0027t believe in her existence, do you Though I am sitting right here with you now.\n Oh, I do believe in her. Of course I do. I believe everything you\u0027ve written. But I know you! Tell me-what actually happened in the desert Did you really believe you would die?\n You would ask that question, David, and right off the bat. I sighed. Well, I can\u0027t claim that I did really believe it. I was probably playing my usual games. I swear to God I don\u0027t tell lies to others. But I lie to myself. I don\u0027t think I can die now, at least not in any way that I myself could contrive.\n He let out a long sigh.\n So why aren\u0027t you afraid of dying, David I don\u0027t mean to torment you with the old offer. I honestly can\u0027t quite figure it out. You\u0027re really, truly not afraid to die, and that I simply do not understand. Because you can die, of course.\n Was he having doubts He didn\u0027t answer immediately. Yet he seemed powerfully stimulated, I could see that. I could all but hear his brain working, though of course I couldn\u0027t hear his thoughts.\n Why the Faust play, David Am I Mephistopheles? I asked. Are you Faust?\n He shook his head. I may be Faust, he said finally, taking another drink of the Scotch, but you\u0027re not the devil, that\u0027s perfectly clear. He gave a sigh.\n I have wrecked things for you, though, haven\u0027t I I knew it in Amsterdam. You don\u0027t stay in the Motherhouse unless you have to. I\u0027m not driving you mad, but I\u0027ve had a very bad effect, have I not?\n Again, he didn\u0027t answer right away. He was looking at me with his large prominent black eyes, and obviously considering the question from all angles. The deep lines of his face-the creases in his forehead, the lines at the corners of his eyes and around the edges of his mouth-reinforced his genial and open expression. There was not a sour note to this being, but there was unhappiness beneath the surface, and it was tangled with deep considerations, going back through a long life.\n Would have happened anyway, Lestat, he said finally. There are reasons why I\u0027m no longer so good at being the Superior General. Would have happened anyway, I\u0027m relatively certain of that.\n Explain it to me. I thought you were in the very womb of the order, that it was your life.\n He shook his head. I was always an unlikely candidate for the Talamasca. I\u0027ve mentioned how I spent my youth in India. I could have lived my life that way. I\u0027m no scholar in the conventional sense, never was. Nevertheless I am like Faust in the play. I\u0027m old, and I haven\u0027t cracked the secrets of the universe. Not at all. I thought I had when I was young. The first time I saw ... a vision. The first time I knew a witch, the first time I heard the voice of a spirit, the first time I called up a spirit and made it do my bidding. I thought I had! But that was nothing. Those are earthbound things. . . earthbound mysteries. Or mysteries I\u0027ll never solve, at any rate.\n He paused, as if he wanted to say something more, something in particular. But then he merely lifted the glass and drank almost absently, and this time without the grimace, for that obviously had been for the first drink of the night. He stared at the glass, and refilled it from the decanter.\n I hated it that I couldn\u0027t read his thoughts, that I caught not the slightest flickering emanations behind his words.\n You know why I became a member of the Talamasca? he asked. It had nothing to do with scholarship at all. Never dreamed I\u0027d be confined to the Motherhouse, wading through papers, and typing files into the computer, and sending faxes off all over the world. Nothing like that at all. It started with another hunting expedition, a new frontier, so to speak, a trip to far-off Brazil. That\u0027s where I discovered the occult, you might say, in the little crooked streets of old Rio, and it seemed every bit as exciting and dangerous as my old tiger hunts had ever been. That\u0027s what drew me-the danger. And how I came to be so far from it, I don\u0027t know.\n I didn\u0027t reply, but something came clear to me, that there was obviously a danger in his knowing me. He must have liked the danger. I had thought he was possessed of a scholar\u0027s naivete about it, but now this didn\u0027t seem to be the case.\n Yes, he said at once, his eyes growing wide as he smiled. Exactly. Although I can\u0027t honestly believe you\u0027d ever harm me.\n Don\u0027t deceive yourself, I said suddenly. And you do, you know. You commit the old sin. You believe in what you see. I am not what you see.\n How so?\n Ah, come now. I look like an angel, but I\u0027m not. The old rules of nature encompass many creatures like me. We\u0027re beautiful like the diamond-backed snake, or the striped tiger, yet we\u0027re merciless killers. You do let your eyes deceive you. But I don\u0027t want to quarrel with you. Tell me this story. What happened in Rio I\u0027m eager to know.\n A little sadness came over me as I spoke these words. I wanted to say, if I cannot have you as my vampire companion, then let me know you as a mortal. It thrilled me, softly and palpably, that we sat there together, as we did.\n All right, he said, you\u0027ve made your point and I acknowledge it. Drawing close to you years ago in the auditorium where you were singing, seeing you the very first tune you came to me-it did have the dark lure of danger. And that you tempt me with your offer-that, too, is dangerous, for I am only human, as we both know.\n I sat back, a little happier, lifting my leg and digging my heel into the leather seat of the old chair. I like people to be a little afraid of me, I said with a shrug. But what happened in Rio?\n I came full in the face of the religion of the spirits; he said. Candomble. You know the word?\n Again I gave a little shrug. Heard it once or twice, I said. I\u0027ll go there sometime, maybe soon. I thought in a flash of the big cities of South America, of her rain forests, and of the Amazon. Yes, I had quite an appetite for such an adventure,\n and the despair that had carried me down into the Gobi seemed very far away. I was glad I was still alive, and quietly I refused to be ashamed.\n Oh, if I could see Rio again, he said softly, more to himself than to me. Of course, she isn\u0027t what she was in those days. She\u0027s a world of skyscrapers now and big luxury hotels. But I would love to see that curving shoreline again, to see Sugar Loaf Mountain, and the statue of Christ atop Corcovado. I don\u0027t believe there is a more dazzling piece of geography on earth. Why did I let so many years go by without returning to Rio?\n Why can\u0027t you go anytime that you wish? I asked. I felt a strong protectiveness for him suddenly. Surely that bunch of monks in London can\u0027t keep you from going. Besides, you\u0027re the boss.\n He laughed in the most gentlemanly manner. No, they wouldn\u0027t stop me, he said. It\u0027s whether or not I have the stamina, both mental and physical. But that\u0027s quite beside the point here, I wanted to tell you what happened. Or perhaps it is the point, I don\u0027t know.\n You have the means to go to Brazil if you want to?\n Oh, yes, that has never been an issue. My father was a clever man when it came to money. As a consequence I\u0027ve never had to give it much thought.\n I\u0027d put the money in your hands if you didn\u0027t have it.\n He gave me one of his warmest, most tolerant smiles. I\u0027m old, he said, I\u0027m lonely, and something of a fool, as any man must be if he has any wisdom at all. But I\u0027m not poor, thank heaven.\n So what happened to you in Brazil How did it begin?\n He started to speak, then fell silent.\n You really mean to remain here To listen to what I have to say?\n Yes, I said immediately. Please. I realized I wanted nothing more in all the world. I had not a single plan or ambition in my heart, not a thought for anything else but being here with him. The simplicity of it stunned me somewhat.\n Still he seemed reluctant to confide in me. Then a subtle change came over him, a sort of relaxation, a yielding perhaps.\n Finally he began.\n It was after the Second World War, he said. The India of my boyhood was gone, simply gone. And besides, I was hungry for new places. I got up a hunting expedition with my friends for the Amazon jungles. I was obsessed with the prospect of the Amazon jungles. We were after the great South American jaguar- He gestured to the spotted skin of a cat I had not noticed before, mounted upon a stand in a corner of the room. How I wanted to track that cat.\n Seems that you did.\n Not immediately, he said with a short ironic laugh. We decided to preface our expedition with a nice luxurious holiday in Rio, a couple of weeks to roam Copacabana Beach, and all the old colonial sites-the monasteries, churches, and so forth. And understand, the center of the city was different in that time, a warren of little narrow streets, and wonderful old architecture! I was so eager for it, for the sheer alien quality of it! That\u0027s what sends us Englishmen into the tropics. We have to get away from all this propriety, this tradition-and immerse ourselves in some seemingly savage culture which we can never tame or really understand.\n His whole manner was changing as he spoke; he was becoming even more vigorous and energetic, eyes brightening and words flowing more quickly in that crisp British accent, which I so loved.\n Well, the city itself surpassed all expectations, of course. Yet it was nothing as entrancing as the people. The people in Brazil are like no people I\u0027ve ever seen. For one thing, they\u0027re exceptionally beautiful, and though everyone agrees on this point, no one knows why. No, I\u0027m quite serious, he said, when he saw me smile, Perhaps it\u0027s the blending of Portuguese and African, and then toss in the Indian blood. I honestly can\u0027t say. The fact is, they are extraordinarily attractive and they have extremely sensuous voices. Why, you could fall in love with their voices, you could end up kissing their voices; and the music, the bossa nova, that\u0027s their language all right.\n You should have stayed there.\n Oh, no! he said, taking another quick sip of the Scotch. Well, to continue. I developed a passion, shall we say, for this boy, Carlos, the very first week. I was absolutely swept away; all we did was drink and make love for days and nights on end in my suite in the Palace Hotel. Quite truly obscene.\n Your friends waited?\n No, laid down the law. Come with us now, or we leave you. But it was perfectly fine with them if Carlos came along. He\n made a little gesture with his right hand. Ah, these were all sophisticated gentlemen, of course.\n Of course.\n But the decision to take Carlos proved to be a dreadful mistake. His mother was a Candomble priestess, though I hadn\u0027t the slightest idea of it, She didn\u0027t want her boy going off into the Amazon jungles. She wanted him going to school. She sent the spirits after me.\n He paused, looking at me, perhaps trying to gauge my reaction.\n That must have been wonderful fun, I said.\n They pummeled me in the darkness. They picked up the bed off the floor and dumped me out! They turned the taps in the shower so that I was nearly scalded. They filled my teacups with urine. After a full seven days, I thought I was going out of my mind. I\u0027d gone from annoyance and incredulity to sheer terror. Dishes flew off the table in front of me. Bells rang in my ears. Bottles went crashing from the shelves. Wherever I went, I saw dark-faced individuals watching roe.\n You knew it was this woman?\n Not at first. But Carlos finally broke down and confessed everything. His mother didn\u0027t intend to remove the curse until I left. Well, I left that very night.\n I came back to London, exhausted and half mad. But it didn\u0027t do any good. They came with me. Same things started to happen right here in Taibot Manor. Doors slamming, furniture moving, the bells ringing all the time in the servants\u0027 pantry belowstairs. Everyone was going mad. And my mother-my mother had been more or less of a spiritualist, always running . to various mediums all over London. She brought in the Talamasca. I told them the whole story, and they started explaining Candomble and spiritism to me.\n They exorcised the demons?\n No. But after about a week\u0027s intense study in the library of the Motherhouse and extensive interviews with the few members who had been to Rio, I was able to get the demons under control myself. Everyone was quite surprised. Then when I decided to go back to Brazil, I astonished them. They warned me this priestess was plenty powerful enough to kill me.\n That\u0027s exactly it I said to them. \u0027I want that sort of power myself. I\u0027m going to become her pupil. She\u0027s going to teach me.\u0027 They begged me not to go. I told them I\u0027d give them a written report on my return. You can understand how I felt. I\u0027d seen the work of these invisible entities. I\u0027d felt them touch me. I\u0027d seen objects hurtling through the air. I thought the great world of the invisible was opening up to me. I had to go there. Why, nothing could have discouraged me from it. Nothing at all.\n Yes, I see, I said. It was as exciting as hunting big game.\n Precisely. He shook his head. Those were the days. I suppose I thought if the war hadn\u0027t killed me, nothing could kill me. He drifted off suddenly, into his memories, locking me out.\n You confronted the woman?\n He nodded.\n Confronted her and impressed her, and then bribed her beyond her wildest dreams. I told her I wanted to become her apprentice. I swore on my knees to her that I wanted to learn, that I wouldn\u0027t leave until I\u0027d penetrated the mystery, and learned all that I could. He gave a little laugh. I\u0027m not sure this woman had ever encountered an anthropologist, even an amateur, and I suppose that is what I might have been called. Whatever, I stayed a year in Rio. And believe you me, that was the most remarkable year of my life. I only left Rio finally, because I knew if I didn\u0027t, I never would. David Talbot the Englishman would have been no more.\n You learned how to summon the spirits?\n He nodded. Again, he was remembering, seeing images I couldn\u0027t see. He was troubled, faintly sad. I wrote it all down, he said finally. It\u0027s in the files at the Motherhouse. Many, many have read the story over the years.\n Never tempted to publish it?\n Can\u0027t do it. It\u0027s part of being in the Talamasca. We never publish outside.\n You\u0027re afraid you\u0027ve wasted your life, aren\u0027t you?\n No. I\u0027m not, really . . . Though what I said earlier is true. I haven\u0027t cracked the secrets of the universe. I\u0027ve never even passed the point I reached in Brazil. Oh, there were shocking revelations afterwards. I remember the first night I read the files on the vampires, how incredulous I was, and then those strange moments when I went down into the vaults and picked through the evidence. But in the end it was like Candomble. I only penetrated so far.\n Believe me, I know. David, the world is meant to remain a mystery. If there is any explanation, we are not meant to hit upon it, of that much I\u0027m sure.\n I think you\u0027re right, he said sadly.\n And I think you\u0027re more afraid of death than you will admit. You\u0027ve taken a stubborn tack with me, a moral one, and I don\u0027t blame you. Maybe you\u0027re old enough and wise enough to really know you don\u0027t want to be one of us. But don\u0027t go talking about death as if it\u0027s going to give you answers. I suspect death is awful. You just stop and there\u0027s no more life, and no more chance to know anything at all.\n No. I can\u0027t agree with you there, Lestat, he said. I simply can\u0027t. He was gazing at the tiger again, and then he said, Somebody formed the fearful symmetry, Lestat. Somebody had to. The tiger and the lamb ... it couldn\u0027t have happened all by itself.\n I shook my head. More intelligence went into the creation of that old poem, David, than ever went into the creation of the world. You sound like an Episcopalian. But I know what you\u0027re saying. I\u0027ve thought it from tune to time myself. Stupidly simple. There has to be something to all this. There has to be! So many missing pieces. The more you consider it, the more atheists begin to sound like religious fanatics. But I think it\u0027s a delusion. It is all process and nothing more.\n Missing pieces, Lestat. Of course! Imagine for a moment that I made a robot, a perfect replica of myself. Imagine I gave him all the encyclopedias of information that I could-you know, programmed it into his computer brain. Well, it would only be a matter of time before he\u0027d come to me, and say, David, where\u0027s the rest of it The explanation! How did it all start Why did you leave out the explanation for why there was ever a big bang in the first place, or what precisely happened when the minerals and other inert compounds suddenly evolved into organic cells What about the great gap in the fossil record\u0027\n I laughed delightedly.\n And I\u0027d have to break it to the poor chap, he said, that there was no explanation. That I didn\u0027t have the missing pieces.\n David, nobody has the missing pieces. Nobody ever will.\n Don\u0027t be so sure.\n That\u0027s your hope, then That\u0027s why you\u0027re reading the Bible You couldn\u0027t crack the occult secrets of the universe, and now you\u0027ve gone back to God?\n God is the occult secret of the universe, David said, thoughtfully, almost as if brooding upon it, face very relaxed and almost young. He was staring at the glass in his hand, maybe liking the way the light collected in the crystal. I didn\u0027t know. I had to wait for him to speak.\n I think the answer might be in Genesis, he said finally, I really do.\n David, you amaze me. Talk about missing pieces. Genesis is a bunch of fragments.\n Yes, but telling fragments remain to us, Lestat. God created man in His own image and likeness. I suspect that that is the key. Nobody knows what it really means, you know. The Hebrews didn\u0027t think God was a man.\n And how can it be the key?\n God is a creative force, Lestat. And so are we. He told Adam, \u0027Increase and multiply.\u0027 That\u0027s what the first organic cells did, Lestat, increased and multiplied. Not merely changed shape but replicated themselves. God is a creative force. He made the whole universe out of Himself through cell division. That\u0027s why the devils are so full of envy-the bad angels, I mean. They are not creative creatures; they have no bodies, no cells, they\u0027re spirit. And I suspect it wasn\u0027t envy so much as a form of suspicion-that God was making a mistake in making another engine of creativity in Adam, so like Himself. I mean the angels probably felt the physical universe was bad enough, with all the replicating cells, but thinking, talking beings who could increase and multiply They were probably outraged by the whole experiment. That was their sin.\n So you\u0027re saying God isn\u0027t pure spirit.\n That\u0027s right. God has a body. Always did. The secret of cell-dividing life lies within God. And all living cells have a tiny part of God\u0027s spirit in them, Lestat, that\u0027s the missing piece as to what makes life happen in the first place, what separates it from nonlife. It\u0027s exactly like your vampiric genesis. You told us that the spirit of Amel-one evil entity-infused the bodies of all the vampires .. . Well, men share in the spirit of God in the same way.\n Good Lord, David, you\u0027re going out of your mind. We\u0027re a mutation.\n Ah, yes, but you exist in our universe, and your mutation mirrors the mutation that we are. Besides, others have struck upon the same theory. God is the fire, and we are all tiny flames; and when we die, those tiny flames go back into the fire of God. But the important thing is to realize that God Himself is Body and Soul! Absolutely.\n Western civilization has been founded upon an inversion. But it is my honest belief that in our daily deeds we know and honor the truth. It is only when we talk religion that we say God is pure spirit and always was and always will be, and that the flesh is evil. The truth is in Genesis, it\u0027s there. I\u0027ll tell you what the big bang was, Lestat. It was when the cells of God began to divide.\n This really is a lovely theory, David. Was God surprised?\n No, but the angels were. I\u0027m quite serious. I\u0027ll tell you the superstitious part-the religious belief that God is perfect. He\u0027s obviously not.\n What a relief, I said. It explains so much.\n You\u0027re laughing at me now. I don\u0027t blame you. But you\u0027re absolutely right. It explains everything. God has made many mistakes. Many, many mistakes. As surely God Himself knows! And I suspect the angels tried to warn Hun. The Devil became the Devil because he tried to warn God. God is love. But I\u0027m not sure God is absolutely brilliant.\n I was trying to suppress my laughter, but I couldn\u0027t do it entirely. David, if you keep this up, you\u0027ll be struck by lightning.\n Nonsense. God does want us to figure it out.\n No. That I can\u0027t accept,\n You mean you accept the rest? he said with another little laugh. No, but I\u0027m quite serious. Religion is primitive in its illogical conclusions. Imagine a perfect God allowing for the Devil to come into existence. No, that\u0027s simply never made sense.\n The entire flaw in the Bible is the notion that God is perfect. It represents a failure of imagination on the part of the early scholars. It\u0027s responsible for every impossible theological question as to good and evil with which we\u0027ve been wrestling through the centuries. God is good, however, wondrously good. Yes, God is love. But no creative force is perfect. That\u0027s clear.\n And the Devil Is there any new intelligence about him?\n He regarded me for a moment with just a touch of impatience. You are such a cynical being, he whispered.\n No, I\u0027m not, I said. I honestly want to know. I have a particular interest in the Devil, obviously. I speak of him much more often than I speak of God. I can\u0027t figure out really why mortals love him so much, I mean, why they love the idea of him. But they do.\n Because they don\u0027t believe in him, David said. Because a perfectly evil Devil makes even less sense than a perfect God. Imagine, the Devil never learning anything during all this time, never changing his mind about being the Devil. It\u0027s an insult to our intellect, such an idea.\n So what\u0027s your truth behind the lie?\n He\u0027s not purely unredeemable. He\u0027s merely part of God\u0027s plan. He\u0027s a spirit allowed to tempt and try humans. He disapproves of humans, of the entire experiment. See, that was the nature of the Devil\u0027s Fall, as I see it. The Devil didn\u0027t think the idea would work. But the key, Lestat, is understanding that God is matter! God is physical, God is the Lord of Cell Division, and the Devil abhors the excess of letting all this cell division run wild.\n Again, he went into one of his maddening pauses, eyes widening again with wonder, and then he said:\n I have another theory about the Devil.\n Tell me.\n There\u0027s more than one of them. And nobody appointed much likes the job. This he said almost in a murmur. He was distracted, as if he wanted to say more, but didn\u0027t.\n I laughed outright.\n Now that I can understand, I said. Who would like the job of being the Devil And to think that one can\u0027t possibly win. And especially considering that the Devil was an angel at the start of it all, and supposed to be very smart.\n Exactly. He pointed his finger at me. Your little story about Rembrandt. The Devil, if he had a brain, should have acknowledged the genius of Rembrandt.\n And the goodness of Faust.\n Ah, yes, you saw me reading Faust in Amsterdam, didn\u0027t you And you purchased your own copy as a consequence.\n How did you know that?\n The proprietor of the bookstore told me the next afternoon. A strange blond-haired young Frenchman came in moments\n after I\u0027d left, bought the very same book, and stood in the street reading it for half an hour without moving. Whitest skin the man had ever seen. Had to be you, of course.\n I shook my head and smiled. I do these clumsy things. It\u0027s a wonder some scientist hasn\u0027t scooped me up in a net.\n That\u0027s no joke, my friend. You were very careless in Miami several nights ago. Two victims drained entirely of blood.\n This created such instant confusion in me that at first I said nothing, then only that it was a wonder the news had reached him on this side of the sea. I felt the old despair touch me with its black wing.\n Bizarre killings make international headlines, he answered. Besides, the Talamasca receives reports of all sorts of things. We have people who clip for us in cities everywhere, sending in items on all aspects of the paranormal for our files. \u0027Vampire Killer Strikes Twice in Miami.\u0027 Several sources sent it along.\n But they don\u0027t really believe it was a vampire, you know they don\u0027t.\n No, but you keep it up and they might come to believe it. That\u0027s what you wanted to happen before with your little rock music career. You wanted them to catch on. It\u0027s not inconceivable. And this sport of yours with the serial killers! You\u0027re leaving quite a trail of those.\n This truly astonished me. My hunting of the killers had taken me back and forth across continents. I had never thought anyone would connect these widely scattered deaths, except Marius, of course.\n How did you come to figure it out?\n I told you. Such stories always come into our hands. Satanism, vampirism, voodoo, witchcraft, sightings of werewolves; it all comes across my desk. Most of it goes into the trash, obviously. But I know the grain of truth when I see it. And your killings are very easy to spot.\n You\u0027ve been going after these mass murderers for some time now. You leave their bodies in the open. You left this last one in a hotel, where he was found only an hour after his death. As for the old woman, you were equally careless! Her son found her the following day. No wounds for the coroner to find on either victim. You\u0027re a nameless celebrity hi Miami, quite overshadowing the notoriety of the poor dead man in the hotel.\n I don\u0027t give a damn, I said angrily. But I did, of course. I deplored my own carelessness, yet I did nothing to correct it. Well, this must surely change. Tonight, had I done any better It seemed cowardly to plead excuses for such things.\n David was watching me carefully. If there was one dominant characteristic to David, it was his alertness. It\u0027s not inconceivable, he said, that you could be caught.\n I gave a scornful, dismissive laugh.\n They could lock you up in a laboratory, study you in a cage of space-age glass.\n That\u0027s impossible. But what an interesting thought.\n I knew it! You want it to happen.\n I shrugged. Might be fun for a little while. Look, it\u0027s a sheer impossibility. The night of my one appearance as a rock singer, all manner of bizarre things happened. The mortal world merely swept up afterwards and closed its files. As for the old woman in Miami, that was a terrible mishap. Should never have happened- I stopped. What about those who died in London this very night\n But you enjoy taking life, he said. You said it was fun.\n I felt such pain suddenly I wanted to leave. But I\u0027d promised I wouldn\u0027t. I just sat there, staring into the fire, thinking about the Gobi Desert, and the bones of the big lizards and the way the light of the sun had filled up the entire world. I thought of Claudia. I smelled the wick of the lamp.\n I\u0027m sorry, I don\u0027t mean to be cruel to you, he said.\n Well, why the hell not I can\u0027t think of a finer choice for cruelty. Besides, I\u0027m not always so kind to you.\n What do you really want What is your overriding passion?\n I thought of Marius, and Louis, who had both asked me that same question many a time.\n What could redeem what I\u0027ve done? I asked. I meant to put an end to the killer. He was a man-eating tiger, my brother. I lay in wait for him. But the old woman-she was a child in the forest, nothing more. But what does it matter? I thought of those wretched creatures whom I\u0027d taken earlier this evening. I\u0027d left such carnage in the back alleys of London. I wish I could remember that it doesn\u0027t matter, I said. I meant to save her. But what good would one act of mercy be in the face of all I\u0027ve done I\u0027m damned if there is a God or a Devil. Now why don\u0027t you go on with your religious talk The odd thing is, I find talk of God and the Devil remarkably soothing. Tell me more about the Devil. He\u0027s changeable, surely. He\u0027s smart. He must feel. Why ever would he remain static?\n Exactly. You know what it says in the Book of Job.\n Remind me.\n Well, Satan is there in heaven, with God. God says, where have you been And Satan says, roaming around the earth! It\u0027s a regular conversation. And they begin arguing about Job. Satan believes Job\u0027s goodness is founded entirely upon his good fortune. And God agrees to let Satan torment Job. This is the most nearly true picture of the situation which we possess. God doesn\u0027t know everything. The Devil is a good friend of his. And the whole thing is an experiment. And this Satan is a far cry from being the Devil as we know him now, worldwide.\n You\u0027re really speaking of these ideas as if they were real beings. . .\n I think they are real, he said, his voice trailing off slightly as he fell into his thoughts. Then he roused himself. I want to tell you something. Actually I should have confessed it before now. In a way, I\u0027m as superstitious and religious as the next man. Because all this is based on a vision of sorts-you know, the sort of revelation that affects one\u0027s reason.\n No, I don\u0027t know. I have dreams but without revelation, I said. Explain, please.\n He sank back into reverie again, looking at the fire.\n Don\u0027t shut me out, I said softly.\n Hmmm. Right. I was thinking how to describe it. Well, you know I am a Candomble priest still. I mean I can summon invisible forces: the pest spirits, the astral tramps, whatever one wants to call them ... the poltergeist, the little haunts. That means I must have always had a latent ability to see spirits.\n Yes. I suppose . . .\n Well, I did see something once, something inexplicable, before I ever went to Brazil.\n Yes?\n Before Brazil, I\u0027d pretty much discounted it. In fact, it was so disturbing, so perfectly unaccountable, that I\u0027d put it out of my mind by the time I went to Rio. Yet now, I think of it all the time. I can\u0027t stop myself from thinking of it. And that\u0027s why I\u0027ve turned to the Bible, as if I\u0027ll find some wisdom there.\n Tell me.\n Happened in Paris right before the war. I was there with my mother. I was in a cafe on the Left Bank, and I don\u0027t even remember now which cafe it was, only that it was a lovely spring day and a simply grand time to be in Paris, as all the songs say. I was drinking a beer, reading the English papers, and I realized I was overhearing a conversation. He drifted away again. I wish I knew what really happened, he murmured under his breath.\n He sat forward, gathered up the poker in his right hand, an jabbed at the logs, sending a plume of fiery sparks up the dark bricks.\n I wanted desperately to pull him back, but I waited. At last he went on.\n I was in this cafe, as I said.\n Yes.\n And I realized I was overhearing this strange conversation . . . and it wasn\u0027t in English and it wasn\u0027t in French . . . and gradually I came to know that it wasn\u0027t in any language really, and yet it was fully understandable to me. I put down my paper, and began to concentrate. On and on it went. It was a sort of argument. And suddenly I didn\u0027t know whether or not the voices were audible in any conventional sense. I wasn\u0027t sure anyone else could actually hear this! I looked up and slowly turned around.\n And there they were . . . two beings, seated at the table talking to each other, and just for a moment, it seemed normal-two men in conversation. I looked back at my paper, and this swimming feeling came over me. I had to anchor myself to something, to fix on the paper for a moment and then the tabletop, and make the swimming cease. The noise of the cafe came back like a full orchestra. And I knew I\u0027d just turned and looked at two individuals who weren\u0027t human beings.\n I turned around again, forcing myself to focus tightly, to be aware of things, keenly aware. And there they were still, and it was painfully clear they were illusory. They simply weren\u0027t of the same fabric as everything else. Do you know what I\u0027m saying I can break it down into parts. They weren\u0027t being illuminated by the same light, for instance, they existed in some realm where the light was from another source.\n Like the light in Rembrandt.\n Yes, rather like that. Their clothes and their faces were smoother than those of human beings. Why, the whole vision was of a different texture, and that texture was uniform in all its details.\n Did they see you?\n No. I mean to say, they didn\u0027t look at me, or acknowledge me. They looked at each other, they went on talking, and I picked up the thread again instantly. It was God talking to the Devil and telling the Devil that he must go on doing the job. And the Devil didn\u0027t want to do it. He explained that his term had already been too long. The same thing was happening to him that had happened to all the others. God said that He understood, but the Devil ought to know how important he was, he couldn\u0027t simply shirk his duties, it wasn\u0027t that simple, God needed him, and needed him to be strong. And all this was very amicable.\n What did they look like?\n That\u0027s the worst part of it. I don\u0027t know. At the time I saw two vague shapes, large, definitely male, or assuming male form, shall we say, and pleasant-looking-nothing monstrous, nothing out of the ordinary really. I wasn\u0027t aware of any absence of particulars-you know, hair color, facial features, that sort of thing. The two figures seemed quite complete. But when I tried to reconstruct the event afterwards, I couldn\u0027t recall any details! I don\u0027t think the illusion was that nearly complete. I think I was satisfied by it, but the sense of completeness sprang from something else.\n From what?\n The content, the meaning, of course.\n They never saw you, never knew you were there.\n My dear boy, they had to know I was there. They must have known. They must have been doing it for my benefit! How else could I have been allowed to see it?\n I don\u0027t know, David. Maybe they didn\u0027t mean for you to see. Maybe it\u0027s that some people can see, and some people can\u0027t. Maybe it was a little rip in the other fabric, the fabric of everything else in the cafe.\n That could be true. But I fear it wasn\u0027t. I fear I was meant to see it and it was meant to have some effect on me. And that\u0027s the horror, Lestat. It didn\u0027t have a very great effect.\n You didn\u0027t change your life on account of it.\n Oh, no, not at all. Why, two days later I doubted I\u0027d even seen it. And with each telling to another person, with each little verbal confrontation-\u0027David, you\u0027ve gone crackers\u0027-it became ever more uncertain and vague. No, I never did anything about it.\n But what was there to do What can anybody do on account of any revelation but live a good life David, surely you told your brethren in the Talamasca about the vision.\n Yes, yes, I told them. But that was much later, after Brazil,, when I filed my long memoirs, as a good member should do. I told them the whole story, such as it was, of course.\n And what did they say?\n Lestat, the Talamasca never says much of anything, that\u0027s what one has to face. \u0027We watch and we are always there.\u0027 To tell the truth, it wasn\u0027t a very popular vision to go talking about with the other members. Speak of spirits in Brazil and you have an audience. But the Christian God and His Devil No, I fear the Talamasca is subject somewhat to prejudices and even fads, like any other institution. The story raised a few eyebrows. 1 don\u0027t recall much else. But then when you\u0027re talking to gentlemen who have seen werewolves, and been seduced by vampires, and fought witches, and talked to ghosts, well, what do you expect?\n But God and the Devil, I said, laughing. David, that\u0027s the big time. Maybe the other members envied you more than you realized.\n No, they didn\u0027t take it seriously, he said, acknowledging my humor with a little laugh of his own. I\u0027m surprised that you\u0027ve taken it seriously, to be quite frank.\n He rose suddenly, excitedly, and walked across the room to the window, and pushed back the drape with his hand. He stood trying to see out into the snow-filled night.\n David, what could these apparitions have meant for you to do?\n I don\u0027t know, he said, in a bitter discouraged voice. That\u0027s my point. I\u0027m seventy-four, and I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll die without knowing. And if there is no illumination, then so be it. That in itself is an answer, whether I am conscious enough to know it or not.\n Come back and sit down, if you will. I like to see your face when you talk.\n He obeyed, almost automatically, seating himself and reaching for the empty glass, eyes shifting to the fire again.\n What do you think, Lestat, really Inside of you Is there a God or a Devil I mean truly, what do you believe?\n I thought for a long time before I answered. Then:\n I do think God exists. I don\u0027t like to say so. But I do. And probably some form of Devil exists as well. I admit-it\u0027s a matter of the missing pieces, as we\u0027ve said. And you might well have seen the Supreme Being and His Adversary in that Paris cafe. But it\u0027s part of their maddening game that we can never figure it out for certain. You want a likely explanation for their behavior Why they let you have a little glimpse They wanted to get you embroiled in some sort of religious response! They play with us that way. They throw out visions and miracles and bits and pieces of divine revelation. And we go off full of zeal and found a church. It\u0027s all part of their game, part of their ongoing and endless talk. And you know I think your view of them-an imperfect God and a learning Devil-is just about as good as anyone else\u0027s interpretation. I think you\u0027ve hit on it.\n He was staring at me intently, but he didn\u0027t reply.\n No, I continued. We aren\u0027t meant to know the answers. We aren\u0027t meant to know if our souls travel from body to body through reincarnation. We aren\u0027t meant to know if God made the world. If He\u0027s Allah or Yahweh or Shiva or Christ. He plants the doubts as He plants the revelations. We\u0027re all His fools.\n Still he didn\u0027t answer.\n Quit the Talamasca, David, I said. Go to Brazil before you\u0027re too old. Go back to India. See the places you want to see.\n Yes, I think I should do that, he said softly. And they\u0027ll probably take care of it all for me. The elders have already met to discuss the entire question of David and his recent absences from the Motherhouse. They\u0027ll retire me with a nice pension, of course.\n Do they know that you\u0027ve seen me?\n Oh, yes. That\u0027s part of the problem. The elders have forbidden contact. Very amusing really, since they are so desperate to lay eyes upon you themselves. They know when you come round the Motherhouse, of course.\n I know they do, I said. What do you mean, they\u0027ve forbidden contact?\n Oh, just the standard admonition, he said, eyes still on the burning log. All very medieval, really, and based upon an old directive: \u0027You are not to encourage this being, not to engage in or prolong conversation; if he persists in his visits, you are to do your best to lure him to some populated place. It is well known that these creatures are loath to attack when surrounded by mortals. And never, never are you to attempt to learn secrets from this being, or to believe for one moment that any emotions evinced by him are genuine, for these creatures dissemble with remarkable ability, and have been known, for reasons that cannot be analyzed, to drive mortals mad. This has befallen sophisticated investigators as well as hapless innocents with whom the vampires come in contact. You are warned to report any and all meetings, sightings, etc., to the elders without delay.\u0027\n Do you really know this by heart?\n I wrote the directive myself, he said, with a little smile. I\u0027ve given it to many other members over the years.\n They know I\u0027m here now?\n No, of course not. I stopped reporting our meetings to them a long time ago. He fell into his thoughts again, and then: Do you search for God? he asked.\n Certainly not, I answered. I can\u0027t imagine a bigger waste of time, even if one has centuries to waste. I\u0027m finished with all such quests. I look to the world around me now for truths, truths mired in the physical and in the aesthetic, truths I can fully embrace. I care about your vision because you saw it, and you told me, and I love you. But that\u0027s all.\n He sat back, gazing off again into the shadows of the room.\n Won\u0027t matter, David. In time, you\u0027ll die. And probably so shall I.\n His smile was warm again as though he could not accept this except as a sort of joke.\n There was a long silence, during which he poured a little more Scotch and drank it more slowly than he had before. He wasn\u0027t even close to being intoxicated. I saw that he planned it that way. When I was mortal I always drank to get drunk. But then I\u0027d been very young, and very poor, castle or no castle, and most of the brew was bad.\n You search for God, he said, with a little nod.\n The hell I do. You\u0027re too full of your own authority. You know perfectly well that I am not the boy you see here.\n Ah, I must be reminded of that, you\u0027re correct. But you could never abide evil. If you\u0027ve told the truth half the time in your books, it\u0027s plain that you were sick of evil from the beginning. You\u0027d give anything to discover what God wants of you and to do what He wants.\n You\u0027re in your dotage already. Make your will.\n Oooh, so cruel, he said with his bright smile.\n I was going to say something else to him, when I was distracted. There was a little pulling somewhere in my consciousness. Sounds. A car passing very slowly on the narrow road through the distant village, in a blinding snow.\n I scanned, caught nothing, merely the snow falling, and the car edging its way along. Poor sad mortal to be driving through the country at this hour. It was four of the clock.\n It\u0027s very late, I said. I have to leave now. I don\u0027t want to spend another night here, though you\u0027ve been most kind. It\u0027s nothing to do with anyone knowing. I simply prefer . . .\n I understand. When will I see you again?\n Perhaps sooner than you think, I said. David, tell me. The other night, when I left here, hell-bent on burning myself to a crisp in the Gobi, why did you say that I was your only friend?\n You are.\n We sat there in silence for a moment.\n You are my only friend as well, David, I said.\n Where are you going?\n I don\u0027t know. Back to London, perhaps. I\u0027ll tell you when I go back across the Atlantic. Is that all right?\n Yes, do tell me. Don\u0027t . . . don\u0027t ever believe that I don\u0027t want to see you, don\u0027t ever abandon me again.\n If I thought I was good for you, if I thought your leaving the order and traveling again was good for you . . .\n Oh, but it is. I don\u0027t belong anymore in the Talamasca. I\u0027m not even sure I trust it any longer, or believe hi its aims.\n I wanted to say more-to tell him how much I loved him, that I\u0027d sought shelter under his roof and he\u0027d protected me and that I would never forget this, and that I would do anything he wished of me, anything at all.\n But it seemed pointless to say so. I don\u0027t know whether he would have believed it, or what the value would have been. I was still convinced that it was not good for him to see me. And there wasn\u0027t very much left to him in this life.\n I know all this, he said quietly, gracing me with that smile again.\n David, I said, the report you made of your adventures in Brazil. Is there a copy here Could I read this report?\n He stood up and went to the glass-doored bookshelf nearest his desk- He looked through the many materials there for a long moment, then removed two large leather folders from the shelf.\n This is my life in Brazil-what I wrote in the jungles after, on a little rattletrap portable typewriter at a camp table, before I came home to England. I did go after the jaguar, of course. Had to do it. But the hunt was nothing compared to my experiences in Rio, absolutely nothing. That was the turning point, you see. I believe the very writing of this was some desperate attempt to become an Englishman again, to distance myself from the Candomble people, from the life I\u0027d been living with them. My report for the Talamasca was based upon the material here.\n I took it from him gratefully.\n And this, he said, holding the other folder, is a brief summary of my days in India and Africa.\n I would like to read that too.\n Old hunting stories mostly. I was young when I wrote this. It\u0027s all big guns and action! It was before the war.\n I took this second folder as well. I stood up, in slow gentlemanly fashion.\n I\u0027ve talked the night away, he said suddenly. That was rude of me. Perhaps you had things to say.\n No, not at all. It was exactly what I wanted. I offered my hand and he took it. Amazing the sensation of his touch against the burnt flesh.\n Lestat, he said, the little short story here... the Lovecraft piece. Do you want it back, or shall I save it for you?\n Ah, that, now that\u0027s a rather interesting tale-I mean how I came in possession of that.\n I took the story from him and shoved it in my coat. Perhaps I\u0027d read it again. My curiosity returned, and along with it a sort of fearful suspicion. Venice, Hong Kong, Miami. How had that strange mortal spotted me in all three places, and managed to see that I had spotted him!\n Do you care to tell me about it? David asked gently,\n When there\u0027s more time, I said, I shall tell you. Especially if I ever see that guy again, I thought. How ever did he do it\n I went out in a civilized manner, actually making a little bit of deliberate noise as I closed the side door of the house.\n It was close to dawn when I reached London. And for the first time in many a night, I was actually glad of my immense powers, and the great feeling of security which they conveyed. I needed no coffins, no dark hiding places, merely a room completely isolated from the rays of the sun. A fashionable hotel with heavy curtains would provide both the peace and the comfort.\n And I had a little time to settle in the warm light of a lamp and begin David\u0027s Brazilian adventure, which I looked forward to, with inordinate delight.\n I had almost no money with me, thanks to my recklessness and madness, so I used my considerable powers of persuasion with the clerks of venerable old Claridge\u0027s so that they accepted the number of my credit account, though I had no card to verify it, and upon my signature-Sebastian Melmoth, one of my favorite aliases-I was shown to a lovely upper suite crowded with charming Queen Anne furniture and fitted with every convenience I could wish.\n I put out the polite little printed notice that I wasn\u0027t to be disturbed, left word with the desk I must not be bothered until well after sunset, then latched all the doors from the inside.\n There really wasn\u0027t time to read. The morning was coming behind the heavy gray sky and the snow drifting down still in large soft wet flakes. I closed all the draperies, save one, so that I might look at the sky, and I stood there, at the front of the hotel, waiting for the spectacle of the light to come, and still a little afraid of its fury, and the pain in my skin growing a little worse from that fear, more than anything else.\n David was much on my mind; I hadn\u0027t ceased to think about our conversation for a second since I\u0027d left him. I kept hearing his voice and trying to imagine his fragmentary vision of God and the Devil in the cafe. But my position on all this was simple and predictable. I thought David in possession of the most comforting delusions. And soon he\u0027d be gone from me. Death would have him. And all I would have would be these manuscripts of his life. I couldn\u0027t force myself to believe he would know anything more at all when he was dead.\n Nevertheless it was all very surprising, really, the turn the conversation had taken, and his energy, and the peculiar things he\u0027d said.\n I was comfortable in these thoughts, watching the leaden sky and the snow piling on the sidewalks far below, when I suddenly experienced a bout of dizziness-in fact, a complete moment of disorientation, as though I were falling asleep. It was very pleasurable, actually, the subtle vibratory sensation, accompanied by a weightlessness, as though I were indeed floating out of the physical and into my dreams. Then came that pressure again which I\u0027d felt so fleetingly in Miami-of my limbs constricting, indeed of my whole form pressing inwards upon me, narrowing me and compressing me, and the sudden frightening image of myself being forced through the very top of my head!\n Why was this happening I shuddered as I had done on that lonely dark Florida beach when it happened before. And at once the feeling was dissipated. I was myself again and vaguely annoyed.\n Was something going wrong with my handsome, godlike anatomy Impossible. I didn\u0027t need the old ones to assure me of such a truth. And I had not made up my mind whether I should worry about this or forget it, or indeed, try to induce it again myself, when I was brought out of my preoccupation by a knock at the door.\n Most irritating.\n A message for you, sir. The gentleman requested I put it in your hands.\n Had to be some mistake. Nevertheless I opened the door The young man gave me an envelope. Fat, bulky. For on second I could only stare at it. I had a one-pound note still in my pocket, from the little thief I\u0027d chomped on earlier, and I gave this to the boy, and locked the door again.\n This was exactly the same kind of envelope I\u0027d been given in Miami by that lunatic mortal who\u0027d come running towards me across the sand. And the sensation! I\u0027d experienced that bizarre sensation right at the moment my eyes had fallen on that creature. Oh, but this was not possible ...\n I tore open the envelope. My hands were suddenly shaking. It was another little printed short story, clipped out of a book exactly as the first one had been, and stapled at the upper-left-hand corner in precisely the same way!\n I was dumbfounded! How in the hell had this being tracked me here No one knew I was here! David didn\u0027t even know I was here! Oh, there were the credit card numbers involved, but dear God, it would have taken hours for any mortal to locate me that way, even if such a thing were possible, which it really was not.\n And what had the sensation to do with it-the curious vibratory feeling and the pressure which seemed to be inside my own limbs\n But there was no time to consider any of this. It was almost morning!\n The danger in the situation made itself immediately apparent to me. Why the hell hadn\u0027t I seen it before This being did most definitely have some means of knowing where I was-even where I chose to conceal myself during daylight! I had to get out of these rooms. How perfectly outrageous!\n Trembling with annoyance, I forced myself to scan this story, which was only a few pages in length. Eyes of the Mummy was the title, author Robert Bloch. A clever little tale, but what could it possibly mean to me I thought of the Lovecraft, which had been much longer and seemed wholly different. What on earth could all this signify The seeming idiocy of it further maddened me.\n But it was too late to think about it anymore. I gathered up David\u0027s manuscripts, and left the rooms, rushing out of a fire exit and going up to the roof. I scanned the night in all directions. I couldn\u0027t find the little bastard! Lucky for him. I would surely have destroyed him on sight. When it comes to protecting my daylight lair, I have little patience or restraint.\n I moved upwards, covering the miles with the greatest speed I could attain. At last I descended in a snow-covered wood far, far north of London and there I dug my own grave in the frozen earth as I had done so many tunes before.\n I was in a fury for having to do so. A positive fury. I\u0027m going to kill this son of a bitch, I thought, whoever the hell he is. How dare he come stalking me, and shoving these stories in my face! Yes, I shall do that, kill him as soon as I catch him.\n But then the drowsiness came, the numbness, and very soon nothing mattered ...\n Once again I was dreaming, and she was there, lighting the oil lamp, and saying, Ah, the flame doesn\u0027t frighten you anymore . . .\n You\u0027re mocking me, I said, miserably. I\u0027d been weeping.\n Ah, but, Lestat, you do have a way of recovering from these cosmic fits of despair awfully fast. There you were dancing under the street lamps in London. Really!\n I wanted to protest, but I was crying, and I couldn\u0027t talk . . .\n In one last jolt of consciousness, I saw that mortal in Venice-under the arches of San Marco-where I\u0027d first noticed him-saw his brown eyes and smooth youthful mouth.\n What do you want I demanded.\n Ah, but it is what you want, he seemed to reply. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-body-thief-the-vampire-chronicles-4/page-6.html","bookId":2212,"book":{"id":2212,"title":"The Tale of the Body Thief (The Vampire Chronicles #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Tale of the Body Thief (The Vampire Chronicles #4) \n Lestat speaks.
