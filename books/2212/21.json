{"id":102907,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"TWENTY\n THE plane ride would have been another absolute nightmare, had I not been so tired that I slept. A full twenty-four hours had passed since my last dreamy rest in Gretchen\u0027s arms, and indeed I fell so deep into sleep now that when David roused me for the change of planes in Puerto Rico, I scarce knew where we were or what we were doing, and for an odd moment, it felt entirely normal to be lugging about this huge heavy body in a state of confusion and thoughtless obedience to David\u0027s commands.\n We did not go outside the terminal for this transfer of planes. And when at last we did land in the small airport in Grenada, I was surprised by the close and delicious Caribbean warmth and the brilliant twilight sky.\n All the world seemed changed by the soft balmy embracing breezes which greeted us. I was glad we had raided the Canal Street shop in New Orleans, for the heavy tweed clothes felt all wrong. As the cab bounced along the narrow uneven road, carrying us to our beachfront hotel, I was transfixed by the lush forest around us, the big red hibiscus blooming beyond little fences, the graceful coconut palms bending over the tiny tumbledown hillside houses, and eager to see, not with this dim frustrating mortal night vision, but in the magical light of the morning sun.\n There had been something absolutely penitential about my undergoing the transformation in the mean cold of Georgetown, no doubt of it at all. Yet when I thought of it-that lovely white snow, and the warmth of Gretchen\u0027s little house, I couldn\u0027t truly complain. It was only that this Caribbean island seemed the true world, the world for real living; and I marveled, as I always did when in these islands, that they could be so beautiful, so warm, and so very poor.\n Here one saw the poverty everywhere-the haphazard wooden houses on stilts, the pedestrians on the borders of the road, the old rusted automobiles, and the total absence of any evidence of affluence, making of course for a quaintness in the eye of the outsider, but something of a hard existence perhaps for the natives, who had never gathered together enough dollars to leave this place, even perhaps for a single day.\n The evening sky was a deep shining blue, as it is often in this part of the world, as incandescent as it can be over Miami, and the soft white clouds made the same clean and dramatic panorama on the far edge of the gleaming sea. Entrancing, and this is but one tiny part of the great Caribbean. Why do I ever wander in other climes at all\n The hotel was in fact a dusty neglected little guesthouse of white stucco under a myriad complex of rusted tin roofs. It was known only to a few Britishers, and very quiet, with a rambling wing of rather old-fashioned rooms looking out over the sands of Grand Anse Beach. With profuse apologies for the broken air-conditioning machines, and the crowded quarters-we must share a room with twin beds, I almost burst into laughter, as David looked to heaven as if to say silently that his persecution would never end!-the proprietor demonstrated that the creaky overhead fan created quite a breeze. Old white louvered shutters covered the windows. The furniture was made of white wicker, and the floor was old tile.\n It seemed very charming to me, but mostly on account of the sweet warmth of the air around me, and the bit of jungle creeping down around the structure, with its inevitable snaggle of banana leaf and Queen\u0027s Wreath vine. Ah, that vine. A nice rule of thumb might be: Don\u0027t ever live in a part of the world which will not support that vine.\n At once we set about to changing clothes. I stripped off the tweeds, and put on the thin cotton pants and shirt I\u0027d bought in New Orleans before we left, along with a pair of white tennis shoes, and deciding against an all-out physical assault upon David, who was changing with his back turned to me, I went out under the graceful arching coconut palms, and made my way down onto the sand.\n The night was as tranquil and gentle as any night I\u0027ve ever known. All my love of the Caribbean came back to me-along with painful and blessed memories. But I longed to see this night with my old eyes. I longed to see past the thickening darkness, and the shadows that shrouded the embracing hills. I longed to turn on my preternatural hearing and catch the soft songs of the jungles, to wander with vampiric speed up the mountains of the interior to find the secret little valleys and waterfalls as only the Vampire Lestat could have done.\n I felt a terrible, terrible sadness for all my discoveries. And perhaps it hit me in its fullness for the first time-that all of my dreams of mortal life had been a lie. It wasn\u0027t that life wasn\u0027t magical; it wasn\u0027t that creation was not a miracle; it wasn\u0027t that the world was not fundamentally good. It was that I had taken my dark power so for granted that I did not realize the vantage point it had given me. I had failed to assess my gifts. And I wanted them back.\n Yes, I had failed, hadn\u0027t I Mortal life should have been enough!\n I looked up at the heartless little stars, such mean guardians, and I prayed to the dark gods who don\u0027t exist to understand.\n I thought of Gretchen. Had she already reached her rain forests, and all the sick ones waiting for the consolations of her touch I wished I knew where she was.\n Perhaps she was already at work in a jungle dispensary, with gleaming vials of medicine, or trekking to nearby villages, with miracles in a pack on her back. I thought of her quiet happiness when she\u0027d described the mission. The warmth of those embraces came back to me, the drowsy sweetness of it, and the comfort of that small room. I saw the snow falling once more beyond the windows. I saw her large hazel eyes fixed on me, and heard the slow rhythm of her speech.\n Then again I saw the deep blue evening sky above me; I felt the breeze that was moving over me as smoothly as if it were water; and I thought of David, David who was here with me now.\n I was weeping when David touched my arm.\n For a moment, I couldn\u0027t make out the features of his face. The beach was dark, and the sound of the surf so enormous that nothing in me seemed to function as it ought to do. Then I realized that of course it was David standing there looking at me, David in a crisp white cotton shirt and wash pants and sandals, managing somehow to look elegant even in this attire-David asking me gently to please come back to the room.\n Jake\u0027s here, he said, our man from Mexico City. I think you should come inside.\n The ceiling fan was going noisily and cool air moved through the shutters as we came into the shabby little room. A faint clacking noise came from the coconut palms, a sound I rather liked, rising and falling with the breeze.\n Jake was seated on one of the narrow saggy little beds-a tall lanky individual in khaki shorts and a white polo shirt, puffing on an odoriferous little brown cigar. All of his skin was darkly tanned, and he had a shapeless thatch of graying blond hair. His posture was one of complete relaxation, but beneath this facade, he was entirely alert and suspicious, his mouth a perfectly straight line.\n We shook hands as he disguised only a little the fact that he was looking me up and down. Quick, secretive eyes, not unlike David\u0027s eyes, though smaller. God only knows what he saw.\n Well, the guns won\u0027t be any problem, he said with an obvious Australian accent. There are no metal detectors at ports such as this. I\u0027ll board at approximately ten a.m., plant your trunk and your guns for you in your cabin on Five Deck, then meet you hi the Cafe Centaur in St. George\u0027s. I do hope you know what you\u0027re doing, David, bringing firearms aboard the Queen Elizabeth 2.\n Of course I know what I\u0027m doing, said David very politely, with a tiny playful smile. Now, what do you have for us on our man?\n Ah, yes. Jason Hamilton. Six feet tall, dark tan, longish blond hair, piercing blue eyes. Mysterious fellow. Very British, very polite. Rumors as to his true identity abound. He\u0027s an enormous tipper, and a day sleeper, and apparently doesn\u0027t bother to leave the ship when she\u0027s in port. Indeed he gives over small packages to be mailed to his cabin steward every morning, quite early, before he disappears for the day. Haven\u0027t been able to discover the post box but that\u0027s a matter of time. He has yet to appear in the Queens Grill for a single meal. It\u0027s rumored he\u0027s seriously ill. But with what, no one knows. He\u0027s the picture of health, which only adds to the mystery. Everyone says so. A powerfully built and graceful fellow with a dazzling wardrobe, it seems. He gambles heavily at the roulette wheel, and dances for hours with the ladies. Seems in fact to like the very old ones. He\u0027d arouse suspicion on that account alone if he weren\u0027t so bloody rich himself. Spends a lot of time simply roaming the ship.\n Excellent. This is just what I wanted to know, said David. You have our tickets.\n The man gestured to a black leather folder on the wicker dressing table. David checked the contents, then gave him an approving nod.\n Deaths on the QE2 so far?\n Ah, now that\u0027s an interesting point. They have had six since they left New York, which is a little more than usual. All very elderly women, and all apparent heart failure. This is the sort of thing you want to know?\n Certainly is, said David:\n The little drink, I thought.\n Now you ought to have a look at these firearms, said Jake, and know how to use them. He reached for a worn little duffel bag on the floor, just the sort of beat-up sack of canvas in which one would hide expensive weapons, I presumed. Out came the expensive weapons-one a large Smith \u0026 Wesson revolver. The other a small black automatic no bigger than the palm of my hand.\n Yes, I\u0027m quite familiar with this, David said, taking the big silver gun and making to aim it at the floor. No problem. He pulled out the clip, then slipped it back in. Pray I don\u0027t have to use it, however. It will make a hell of a noise.\n He then gave it to me.\n Lestat, get the feel of it, he said. Of course there\u0027s no time to practice. I asked for a hair trigger.\n And that you have, said Jake, looking at me coldly. So please watch out.\n Barbarous little thing, I said. It was very heavy. A nugget of destructiveness. I spun the cylinder. Six bullets. It had a curious smell.\n Both the guns are thirty-eights, said the man, with a slight note of disdain. Those are man-stoppers. He showed me a small cardboard box. You\u0027ll have plenty of ammunition available to you for whatever it is that you are going to do on this boat.\n Don\u0027t worry, Jake, said David firmly. Things will probably go without a hitch. And I thank you for your usual efficiency. Now, go have a pleasant evening on the island. And I shall see you at the Centaur Cafe before noon.\n The fellow gave me a deep suspicious look, then nodded, gathered up the guns and the little box of bullets, put them back in his canvas bag, and offered his hand again to me and then to David, and out he went. I waited until the door had closed.\n I think he dislikes me, I said. Blames me for involving you in some sort of sordid crime.\n David gave a short little laugh. I\u0027ve been in far more compromising situations than this one, he said. And if I worried about what our investigators thought of us, I would have retired a long time ago. What do we know now from this information?\n Well, he\u0027s feeding on the old women. Probably stealing from them also. And he\u0027s mailing home what he steals in packages too small to arouse suspicion. What he does with the larger loot we\u0027ll never know. Probably throws it into the ocean. I suspect there\u0027s more than one post box number. But that\u0027s no concern of ours.\n Correct. Now lock the door. It\u0027s time for a little concentrated witchcraft. We\u0027ll have a nice supper later on. I have to teach you to veil your thoughts. Jake could read you too easily. And so can I. The Body Thief will pick up your presence when he\u0027s still two hundred miles out to sea.\n Well, I did it through an act of will when I was Lestat, I said. I haven\u0027t the faintest idea how to do it now.\n Same way. We\u0027re going to practice. Until I can\u0027t read a single image or random word from you. Then we\u0027ll get to the out-of-body travel. He looked at his watch, which reminded me of James suddenly, in that little kitchen. Slip that bolt. I don\u0027t want any maid blundering in here later on.\n I obeyed. Then I sat on the bed opposite David, who had assumed a very relaxed yet commanding attitude, rolling up the stiff starched cuffs of his shirt, which revealed the dark fleece of his arms. There was also quite a bit of dark hair on his chest, bubbling up through the open collar of the shirt. Only a little gray mixed in with it, like the gray that sparkled here and there in his heavy shaven beard. I found it quite impossible to believe he was a man of seventy-four.\n Ah, I caught that, he said with a little lift of the eyebrows. I catch entirely too much. Now. Listen to what I say. You must fix it in your mind that your thoughts remain within you, that you are not attempting to communicate with others-not through facial expression or body language of any sort; that indeed you are impenetrable. Make an image of your sealed mind if you must. Ah, that\u0027s good. You\u0027ve gone blank behind your handsome young face. Even your eyes have changed ever so slightly. Perfect. Now I\u0027m going to try to read you. Keep it up.\n By the end of forty-five minutes, I had learned the trick fairly painlessly, but I could pick up nothing of David\u0027s thoughts even when he tried his hardest to project them to me. In this body, I simply did not have the psychic ability which he possessed. But the veiling we had achieved, and this was a crucial step. We would continue to work on all this throughout the night.\n We\u0027re ready to begin on the out-of-body travel, he said.\n This is going to be hell, I said. I don\u0027t think I can get out of this body. As you can see, I just don\u0027t have your gifts.\n Nonsense, he said. He loosened his posture slightly, crossing his ankles and sliding down a bit in the chair. But somehow, no matter what he did, he never lost the attitude of the teacher, the authority, the priest. It was implicit in his small, direct gestures and above all in his voice.\n Lie down on that bed, and close your eyes. And listen to every word I say.\n I did as I was told. And immediately felt a little sleepy. His voice became even more directive in its softness, rather like that of a hypnotist, bidding me to relax completely, and to visualize a spiritual double of this form.\n Must I visualize myself with this body?\n No. Doesn\u0027t matter. What matters is that you-your mind, your soul, your sense of self-are linked to the form you envision. Now picture it as congruent with your body, and then imagine that you want to lift it up and out of the body-that you want to go up!\n For some thirty minutes David continued this unhurried instruction, reiterating in his own fashion the lessons which priests had taught to their initiates for thousands of years. I knew the old formula. But I also knew complete mortal vulnerability, and a crushing sense of my limitations, and a stiffening and debilitating fear.\n We had been at it perhaps forty-five minutes when I finally sank into the requisite and lovely vibratory state on the very cusp of sleep. My body seemed in fact to have become this delicious vibratory feeling, and nothing more! And just when I realized this, and might have remarked upon it, I suddenly felt myself break loose and begin to rise.\n I opened my eyes; or at least I thought I did. I saw I was floating directly above my body; in fact, I couldn\u0027t even see the real flesh-and-blood body at all. Go up! I said. And instantly I traveled to the ceiling with the exquisite lightness and speed of a helium balloon! It was nothing to turn completely over and look straight down into the room.\n Why, I had passed through the blades of the ceiling fan! Indeed, it was in the very middle of my body, though I could feel nothing. And down there, under me, was the sleeping mortal form I had inhabited so miserably all of these strange days. Its eyes were closed, and so was its mouth.\n I saw David sitting hi his wicker chair, right ankle on his left knee, hands relaxed on his thighs, as he looked at the sleeping man. Did he know I had succeeded I couldn\u0027t hear a word he was speaking. Indeed, I seemed to be in a totally different sphere from these two solid figures, though I felt utterly complete and entire and real myself.\n Oh, how lovely this was! This was so near to my freedom as a vampire that I almost began to weep again. I felt so sorry for the two solid and lonely beings down there. I wanted to pass up through the ceiling and into the night.\n Slowly I went up, and then out over the roof of the hotel, until I was hovering above the white sand.\n But this was enough, wasn\u0027t it Fear gripped me, the fear I\u0027d known when I did this little trick before. What hi the name of God was keeping me alive hi this state! I needed my body! At once I plummeted, blindly, back into the flesh. I woke up, tingling all over, and staring at David as he sat staring back at me.\n I did it, I said. I was shocked to feel these tubes of skin and bone enclosing me again, and to see my fingers moving when I told them to do it, to feel my toes come alive hi my shoes. Lord God, what an experience! And so many, many mortals had sought to describe it. And so many more, in their ignorance, did not believe that such a thing could be.\n Remember to veil your thoughts, David said suddenly. No matter how exhilarated you become. Lock your mind up tight!\n Yes, sir.\n Now let\u0027s do it all again.\n By midnight-some two hours later-I had learned to rise at will. Indeed, it was becoming addictive-the feeling of lightness, the great swooshing ascent! The lovely ease of passing through walls and ceiling; and then the sudden and shocking return. There was a deep throbbing pleasure to it, pure and shining, like an eroticism of the mind.\n Why can\u0027t a man die in this fashion, David I mean why can\u0027t one simply rise into the heavens and leave the earth?\n Did you see an open doorway, Lestat? he asked.\n No, I said sadly. I saw this world. It was so clear, so beautiful. But it was this world.\n Come now, you must learn to make the assault.\n But I thought you would do it, David. You\u0027d jolt him and knock nun out of his body and . . .\n Yes, and suppose he spots me before I can do it, and makes me into a nice little torch. What then No, you must learn the trick as well.\n This was far more difficult. Indeed it required the very opposite of the passivity and relaxation which we had employed and developed before. I had now to focus all my energy upon David with the avowed purpose of knocking him out of his body-a phenomenon which I could not hope to see in any real sense- and then go into his body myself. The concentration demanded of me was excruciating. The timing was critical. And the repeated efforts produced an intense and exhausting nervousness rather like that of a right-handed person trying to write perfectly with the left hand.\n I was near to tears of rage and frustration more than once. But David was absolutely adamant that we must continue and that this could be done. No, a stiff drink of Scotch wouldn\u0027t help. No, we couldn\u0027t eat until later. No, we couldn\u0027t break for a walk on the beach or a late swim.\n The first time I succeeded, I was absolutely aghast. I went speeding towards David, and felt the impact in the same purely mental fashion in which I felt the freedom of the flight. Then I was inside David, and for one split second saw myself-slack-jawed and staring dully-through the dun lenses of David\u0027s eyes.\n Then I felt a dark shuddering disorientation, and an invisible blow as if someone had placed a huge hand on my chest. I realized that he had returned and pushed me out. I was hovering in the air, and then back in my own sweat-drenched body, laughing near hysterically from mad excitement and sheer fatigue.\n That\u0027s all we need, he said. Now I know we can pull this off. Come, once again! We\u0027re going to do it twenty times if we have to, until we know that we can achieve it without fail.\n On the fifth successful assault, I remained in his body for a full thirty seconds, absolutely mesmerized by the different feelings attendant to it-the lighter limbs, the poorer vision, and the peculiar sound of my voice coming out of his throat. I looked down and saw his hands-thin, corded with blood vessels, and touched on the backs of the fingers with dark hair-and they were my hands! How hard it was to control them. Why, one of them had a pronounced tremour which I had never noticed before.\n Then came the jolt again, and I was flying upwards, and then the plummet, back into the twenty-six-year-old body once more.\n We must have done it twelve times before the slave driver of a Candomble priest said it was time for him to really fight my assault.\n Now, you must come at me with much greater determination. Your goal is to claim the body! And you expect a fight.\n For an hour we battled. Finally, when I was able to jolt him out and keep him out for the space of ten seconds, he declared that this would be enough.\n He told you the truth about your cells. They will know you. They will receive you and strive to keep you. Any adult human knows how to use his own body much better than the intruder. And of course you know how to use those preternatural gifts in ways of which he can\u0027t possibly even dream. I think we can do it. In fact, I\u0027m certain now that we can.\n But tell me something, I said. Before we stop, don\u0027t you want to jolt me out of this body and go into it I mean, just to see what it\u0027s like?\n No, he said quietly. I don\u0027t.\n But aren\u0027t you curious? I asked him. Don\u0027t you want to know . . .\n I could see that I was taxing his patience.\n Look, the real truth is, we don\u0027t have time for that experience. And maybe I don\u0027t want to know. I can remember my youth well enough. Too well, in fact. We aren\u0027t playing little games here. You can make the assault now. That\u0027s what counts. He looked at his watch. It\u0027s almost three. We\u0027ll have some supper and then we\u0027ll sleep. We\u0027ve a full day ahead, exploring the ship and confirming our plans. We must be rested and in full control of our faculties. Come, let\u0027s see what we can rustle up in the way of food or drink.\n We went outside and along the walk until we reached the little kitchen-a funny, damp, and somewhat cluttered room. The kindly proprietor had left two plates for us in the rusted, groaning refrigerator, along with a bottle of white wine. We sat down at the table and commenced to devour every morsel of rice, yams, and spiced meat, not caring at all that it was very cold.\n Can you read my thoughts? I asked, after I\u0027d consumed two glasses of wine.\n Nothing, you\u0027ve got the trick.\n So how do I do it in my sleep The Queen Elizabeth 2 can\u0027t be more than a hundred miles out now. She\u0027s to dock in two hours.\n Same way you do it when you\u0027re awake. You shut down. You close up. Because, you see, no one is ever completely asleep. Not even those in a coma are completely asleep. Will is always operative. And will is what this is about.\n I looked at him as we sat there. He was obviously tired, but he did not look haggard or in any way debilitated. His thick dark hair obviously added to the impression of vigor; and his large dark eyes had the same fierce light in them which they always had.\n I finished quickly, shoved the dishes into the sink, and went out on the beach without bothering to say what I meant to do. I knew he would say we had to rest now, and I didn\u0027t want to be deprived of this last night as a human being under the stars.\n Going down to the lip of the water, I peeled off the cotton clothes, and went into the waves. They were cool but inviting, and then I stretched out my arms and began to swim. It was not easy, of course. But it wasn\u0027t hard either, once I resigned myself to the fact that humans did it this way-stroke by stroke against the force of the water, and letting the water buoy the cumbersome body, which it was entirely willing to do.\n I swam out quite far, and then rolled over on my back and looked at the sky. It was still full of fleecy white clouds. A moment of peace came over me, in spite of the chill on my exposed skin, and the dimness all around me, and the strange feeling of vulnerability I experienced as I floated on this dark treacherous sea. When I thought of being back in my old body, I could only be happy, and once again, I knew that in my human adventure, I had failed.\n I had not been the hero of my own dreams. I had found human life too hard.\n Finally I swam back into the shallows and then walked up onto the beach. I picked up my clothes, shook off the sand, slung them over my shoulder, and walked back to the little room.\n Only one lamp burned on the dressing table. David was sitting on his bed, closest to the door, and dressed only in a long white pajama shirt and smoking one of those little cigars. I liked the scent of it, dark and sweet.\n He looked his usual dignified self, arms folded, eyes full of normal curiosity as he watched me take a towel from the bath and dry off my hair and my skin.\n Just called London, he said.\n What\u0027s the news? I wiped my face with the towel, then slung it over the back of the chair. The air felt so good on my naked skin, now that it was dry.\n Robbery in the hills above Caracas. Very similar to the crimes in Curacao. A large villa full of artifacts, jewels, paintings. Much was smashed; only small portables were stolen; three people dead. We should thank the gods for the poverty of the human imagination-for the sheer meanness of this man\u0027s ambitions-and that our opportunity to stop him has come so soon. In time, he would have wakened to his monstrous potential. As it is, he is our predictable fool.\n Does any being use what he possesses? I asked. Perhaps a few brave geniuses know their true limits. What do the rest of us do but complain?\n I don\u0027t know, he said, a sad little smile passing over his face. He shook his head and looked away. Some night, when this is all over, tell me again how it was for you. How you could be in that beautiful young body and hate this world so much. I\u0027ll tell you, but you\u0027ll never understand. You\u0027re on the wrong side of the dark glass. Only the dead know how terrible it is to be alive.\n I pulled a loose cotton T-shirt out of my little suitcase, but I didn\u0027t put it on. I sat down on the bed beside him. And then I bent down and kissed his face again gently, as I had in New Orleans, liking the feel of his roughly shaven beard, just as I liked that sort of thing when I was really Lestat and I would soon have that strong masculine blood inside.\n I moved closer to him, when suddenly he grasped my hand, and I felt him gently push me away.\n Why, David? I asked him.\n He didn\u0027t answer. He lifted his right hand and brushed my hair back out of my eyes.\n I don\u0027t know, he whispered. I can\u0027t. I simply can\u0027t.\n He got up gracefully, and went outside into the night.\n I was too furious with pure stymied passion to do anything for a moment. Then I followed him out. He had gone down on the sand a ways and he stood there alone, as I had done before.\n I came up behind him.\n Tell me, please, why not?\n I don\u0027t know, he said again. I only know I can\u0027t. I want to. Believe me, I do. But I can\u0027t. My past is ... so close to me. He let out a long sigh, and for a while was silent again. Then he went on. My memories of those days are so clear. It\u0027s as if I\u0027m in India again, or Rio. Ah, yes, Rio. It\u0027s as if I am that young man again.\n I knew I was to blame for this. I knew it, and that it was useless to say apologetic words. I also sensed something else. I was an evil being, and even when I was in this body, David .could sense that evil. He could sense the powerful vampiric \u0027greed. It was an old evil, brooding and terrible. Gretchen hadn\u0027t sensed it. I had deceived her with this warm and smiling body. But when David looked at me, he saw that blond blue-eyed demon whom he knew very well.\n I said nothing. I merely looked out over the sea. Give me back my body. Let me be that devil, I thought. Take me away from this paltry brand of desire and this weakness. Take me back into the dark heavens where I belong. And it seemed suddenly that my loneliness and my misery were as terrible as they had ever been before this experiment, before this little sojourn into more vulnerable flesh. Yes, let me be outside it again, please. Let me be a watcher. How could I have been such a fool\n I heard David say something to me, but I didn\u0027t really catch the words. I looked up slowly, pulling myself out of my thoughts, and I saw that he had turned to face me, and I realized that his hand was resting gently on my neck. I wanted to say something angry-Take your hand away, don\u0027t torment me-but I didn\u0027t speak.\n No, you\u0027re not evil, that\u0027s not it, he whispered. It\u0027s me, don\u0027t you understand. It\u0027s my fear! You don\u0027t know what this adventure has meant to me! To be here again in this part of the great world-and with you! I love you. I love you desperately and insanely, I love the soul inside you, and don\u0027t you see, it\u0027s not evil. It\u0027s not greedy. But it\u0027s immense. It overpowers even this youthful body because it is your soul, fierce and indomitable and outside time-the soul of the true Lestat. I can\u0027t give in to it. I can\u0027t... do it. I\u0027ll lose myself forever if I do it, as surely as if. . . as if. . .\n He broke off, too shaken obviously to go on. I\u0027d hated the pain in his voice, the faint tremour undermining its deep firmness. How could I ever forgive myself I stood still, staring past him into the darkness. The lovely pounding of the surf and the faint clacking of the coconut palms were the only sounds. How vast were the heavens; how lovely and deep and calm these hours just before dawn. I saw Gretchen\u0027s face. I heard her voice. There was a moment this morning when I thought I could throw up everything-just to be with you... I could feel it sweeping me away, the way the music once did. And if you were to say Come with me, even now, I might go...
