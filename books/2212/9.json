{"id":102895,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"EIGHT THE next night, I went at once to Jackson Square. The terrible norther had finally come down into New Orleans, bringing with it a freezing wind. This sort of thing can happen at any time during the winter months, though some years it happens not at all. I\u0027d stopped at my rooftop flat to put on a heavy wool overcoat, delighted as before that I had such feeling now in my newly bronzed skin. A few tourists braved the weather to visit the cafes and bakeries still open near the cathedral; and the evening traffic was noisy and hurried. The greasy old Cafe du Monde was crowded behind its closed doors. I saw him immediately. What luck. They had chained the gates of the square, as they always did now at sunset, a dreadful annoyance, and he was outside, facing the cathedral, looking anxiously about. I had a moment to study him before he realized I was there. He was a little taller than I am, six feet two, I figured, and he was extremely well built, as I\u0027d seen before. I\u0027d been right about the age. The body couldn\u0027t have been more than twenty-five years old. He was clad in very expensive clothes-a fur-lined raincoat, very well tailored, and a thick scarlet cashmere scarf. When he saw me, a spasm passed through him, of pure anxiety and mad delight. That awful glittering smile came over him and vainly trying to conceal his panic, he fixed his eyes upon me as I made a slow, humanlike approach. Ah, but you do look like an angel, Monsieur de Lioncourt, he whispered breathlessly, and how splendid your darkened skin. What a lovely enhancement. Forgive me for not saying so before. So you\u0027re here, Mr. James, I said, raising my eyebrows. What\u0027s the proposition I don\u0027t like you. Talk fast. Don\u0027t be so rude, Monsieur de Lioncourt, he said. It would be a dreadful mistake to offend me, really it would. Yes, a voice exactly like David\u0027s voice. Same generation, most likely. And something of India in it, no doubt. You\u0027re quite right on that, he said. I spent many years in India too. And a little time in Australia and Africa as well. Ah, so you can read my thoughts very easily, I said. No, not as easily as you might think, and now probably not at all. I\u0027m going to kill you, I said, if you don\u0027t tell me how you\u0027ve managed to follow me and what you want, You know what I want, he said, laughing mirthlessly and anxiously under his breath, his eyes fixing on me and then veering away. I told you through the stories, but I can\u0027t talk here in the freezing cold. This is worse than Georgetown, which is where I live, by the way. I was hoping to escape this sort of weather. And why ever did you drag me to London and Paris at this time of year? More dry anxious spasms of laughter. Obviously he couldn\u0027t stare at me for more than a minute before glancing away as if I were a blinding light. It was bitter cold in London. I hate cold. This is the tropics, is it not Ah, you with your sentimental dreams of winter snow. This last remark stunned me before I could conceal it. I was enraged for one silent instant, and then I regained my control. Come, the cafe, I said, pointing to the old French Market at the other side of the square. I hurried ahead along the pavement. I was too confused and excited to risk another word. The cafe was extremely noisy but warm. I led the way to a table in the farthest corner from the door, ordered the famous cafe au lait for both of us, and sat there in rigid silence, faintly distracted by the stickiness of the little table, and grimly fascinated by him, as he shivered, unwound his red scarf anxiously, then put it on again, and finally pulled off his fine leather gloves, and stuffed them in his pockets, and then took them out again, and put on one of them, and laid the other one on the table and then snatched it up again, and put it on as well. There was something positively horrible about him, about the way this alluringly splendid body was pumped up with his devious, jittery spirit, and cynical fits of laughter. Yet I couldn\u0027t take my eyes off him. In some devilish way I enjoyed watching him. And I think he knew it. There was a provocative intelligence lurking behind this flawless, beautiful face. He made me realize how intolerant I had become of anyone truly young. Suddenly the coffee was set down before us, and I wrapped my naked hands around the warm cup. I let the steam rise in my face. He watched this, with his large clear brown eyes, as if he were the one who was fascinated, and now he tried to hold my gaze steadily and calmly, which he found very hard. Delicious mouth, pretty eyelashes, perfect teeth. What the hell\u0027s the matter with you? I asked. You know. You\u0027ve figured it out. I\u0027m not fond of this body, Monsieur de Lioncourt. A body thief has his little difficulties, you know. Is that what you are? Yes, a body thief of the first rank. But then you knew that when you agreed to see me, did you not You must forgive me my occasional clumsiness, I have been for most of my life a lean if not emaciated man. Never in such good health. He gave a sigh, the youthful face for a moment sad. But those chapters are closed now, he said with sudden discomfort. Let me come to the point immediately, out of respect for your enormous preternatural intellect and vast experience- Don\u0027t mock me, you little pissant! I said under my breath. **You play with me, I\u0027ll tear you apart slowly. I told you I don\u0027t like you. Even your little title for yourself I don\u0027t like. That shut him up. He canned down altogether. Perhaps he lost his temper, or was frozen with terror. I think it was simply that he stopped being so fearful and became coldly angry instead. All right, he said softly, and soberly, without all the frenzy. I want to trade bodies with you. I want yours for a week. I\u0027ll see to it that you have this body. It\u0027s young, it\u0027s in perfect health. You like the look of it, obviously. I shall show you various certificates of health if you wish. The body was quite thoroughly tested and examined right before I took possession of it. Or stole it. It\u0027s quite strong; you can see that. Obviously, it\u0027s strong, quite remarkably strong- How can you do it? We do it together, Monsieur de Lioncourt, he said very politely, his tone becoming more civil and courteous with each sentence he spoke. There can be no question of body theft when I\u0027m dealing with a creature such as you. But you\u0027ve tried, haven\u0027t you? He studied me for a moment, clearly unsure as to how he should answer. Well, you can\u0027t blame me for that now, can you? he said imploringly. Any more than I can blame you for drinking blood. He smiled as he said the word blood. But really I was simply trying to get your attention, which isn\u0027t an easy thing to do. He seemed thoughtful, utterly sincere. Besides, cooperation is always involved on some level, no matter how submerged that level may be. Yes, I said, but what are the actual mechanics, if that isn\u0027t too crude a word. How do we cooperate with each other! Be specific with me. I don\u0027t believe this can be done. Oh, come now, of course you do, he suggested gently, as if he were a patient teacher. It seemed almost an impersonation of David, without David\u0027s vigor. How else would I have managed to take ownership of this body? He made a little illustrative gesture as he continued. We will meet at an appropriate place. Then we will rise out of our bodies, which you know very well how to do and have so eloquently described in your writing, and then we will take possession of each other\u0027s bodies. There\u0027s nothing to it really, except complete courage and an act of will. He lifted the cup, his hand trembling violently, and he drank a mouthful of the hot coffee. For you, the test will be the courage, nothing more. What will keep me anchored in the new body? There\u0027ll be no one in there, Monsieur de Lioncourt, to push you out. This is entirely different from possession, you understand. Oh, possession is a battle. When you enter into this body, there will be not the slightest resistance from it. You can remain until you choose to disengage. It\u0027s too puzzling! I said, with obvious annoyance. I know reams have been written on these questions, but something doesn\u0027t quite .. . Let me try to put it in perspective, he said, voice hushed and almost exquisitely accommodating. We\u0027re dealing here with science, but it is science which has not yet been fully codified by scientific minds. What we have are the memoirs of poets and occult adventurers, quite incapable of anatomizing what takes place. Exactly. As you pointed out, I\u0027ve done it myself, traveled out of the body. Yet I don\u0027t know what takes place. Why doesn\u0027t the body die when one leaves it I don\u0027t understand. The soul has more than one part, as does the brain. Surely you know that a child can be born without a cerebellum, yet the body can live if it has what is called the brain stem. Dreadful thought. Happens all the time, I assure you. Victims of accidents in which the brain is damaged irretrievably can still breathe and . even yawn in their slumber, as the lower brain carries on. And you can possess such bodies? Oh, no, I need a healthy brain in order to take full possession, absolutely must have all those cells in good working order and able to lock into the invading mind Mark my words, Monsieur de Lioncourt. Brain is not mind. But again, we are not talking of possession, but of something infinitely finer than that. Allow me to continue, please. Go ahead. As I was saying, the soul has more than one part, in the same manner as the brain. The larger part of it-identity, personality, consciousness, if you will-this is what springs loose and travels; but a small residual soul remains. It keeps the vacant body animate, so to speak, for otherwise vacancy would mean death, of course. I see. The residual soul animates the brain stem; that is what you mean. Yes. When you rise out of your body, you will leave a residual soul there. And when you come into this body, you will find the residual soul there as well. It\u0027s the very same residual soul I found when I took possession. And that soul will lock with any higher soul eagerly and automatically; it wants to embrace that higher soul. Without it, it feels incomplete. And when death occurs both souls leave? Precisely. Both souls go together, the residual soul and the larger soul, in a violent evacuation, and then the body is a mere lifeless shell and begins its decay. He waited, observing me with the same seemingly sincere patience, and then he said: The tale of the Body Thief Believe me, the force of actual death is much stronger. There\u0027s no danger at all in what we propose to do. But if this little residual soul is so damned receptive, why can\u0027t I, with all my power, jolt some little mortal soul right out of its skin, and move in? Because the larger soul would try to reclaim its body, Monsieur de Lioncourt, even if there were no understanding of the process, it would try again and again. Souls do not want to be without a body. And even though the residual soul welcomes the invader, something in it always recognizes the particular soul of which it was once a part. It will choose that soul if there is a battle. And even a bewildered soul can make a powerful attempt to reclaim its mortal frame. I said nothing, but much as I suspected him, indeed reminded myself to be on guard, I found a continuity in all he said. Possession is always a bloody struggle, he reiterated. Look what happens with evil spirits, ghosts, that sort of thing. They\u0027re always driven out eventually, even if the victor never knows what took place. When the priest comes with his incense and his holy-water mumbo jumbo, he is calling on that residual soul to oust the intruder and draw the old soul back in. But with the cooperative switch, both souls have new bodies. Precisely. Believe me, if you think you can hop into a human body without my assistance, well, give it a try, and you\u0027ll see what I mean. You\u0027ll never really experience the five senses of a mortal as long as the battle\u0027s raging inside. His manner became even more careful, confidential. Look at this body again, Monsieur de Lioncourt, he said with beguiling softness. It can be yours, absolutely and truly yours. His pause seemed as precise suddenly as ms words. It was a year ago you first saw it in Venice. It\u0027s been host to an intruder without interruption for all of that time. It will play host to you. Where did you get it? Stole it, I told you, he said. The former owner is dead. You have to be more specific. Oh, must I, really I do so hate to incriminate myself. I\u0027m not a mortal officer of the law, Mr. James. I\u0027m a vampire. Speak in words I can understand. He gave a soft, faintly ironic laugh. The body was carefully chosen, he said. The former owner had no mind left. Oh, there was nothing organically wrong with him, absolutely nothing. As I told you, he\u0027d been quite thoroughly tested. He\u0027d become a great quiet laboratory animal of sorts. He never moved. Never spoke. His reason had been hopelessly shattered, no matter how the healthy cells of the brain continued to pop and crackle along, as they are wont to do. I accomplished the switch in stages. Jolting him out of his body was simple. It was luring him down into my old body and leaving him there which took the skill. Where is your old body now? Monsieur de Lioncourt, there is simply no way that the old soul will ever come knocking; that I guarantee. I want to see a picture of your old body. Whatever for? Because it will tell me things about you, more perhaps than you yourself are telling me. I demand it. I won\u0027t proceed without it. You won\u0027t? He retained the polite smile. What if I get up and leave here? I\u0027ll kill your splendid new body as soon as you try. No one in this cafe will even notice. They\u0027ll think you\u0027re drunk and that you\u0027ve tumbled into my arms. I do that sort of thing all the time. He fell silent, but I could see that he was calculating fiercely, and then I realized how much he was savoring all this, that he had been all along. He was like a great actor, deeply immersed in the most challenging part of his career. He smiled at me, with startling seductiveness, and then, carefully removing his right glove, he drew a little item out of his pocket and put it in my hand. An old photograph of a gaunt man with thick white wavy hair. I judged him to be perhaps fifty. He wore some sort of white uniform with a little black bow tie. He was a very nice looking man, actually, much more delicate in appearance than David, but he had the same sort of British elegance about him, and his smile was not unpleasant. He was leaning on the railing of what might have been the deck of a ship. Yes, it was a ship. You knew I\u0027d ask for this, didn\u0027t you? Sooner or later, he said. When was this taken? That\u0027s of no importance. Why on earth do you want to know? He betrayed just a little annoyance, but then he covered it at once. It was ten years ago, he said with a slight sinking of the voice. Will it do? And so that makes you .. . what Mid-sixties, perhaps? I\u0027ll settle for that, he said with a very broad and intimate smile. How did you learn all this Why haven\u0027t others perfected this trick? He looked me up and down and a little coldly, and I thought his composure might snap. Then he retreated into his polite manner again. Many people have done it, he said, his voice assuming a tone of special confidence. Your friend David Talbot could have told you that. He didn\u0027t want to. He lies, like all those wizards in the Talamasca. They\u0027re religious. They think they can control people; they use their knowledge for control. How do you know about them? I was a member of their order, he said, his eyes brightening playfully, as he smiled again. They kicked me out of it. They accused me of using my powers for gain. What else is there, Monsieur de Lioncourt What do you use your powers for, if not for gain? So, Louis had been right. I didn\u0027t speak. I tried to scan him but it was useless. Instead, I received a strong sense of his physical presence, of the heat emanating from him, of the hot fount of his blood. Succulent, that was the word for this body, no matter what one thought of his soul. I disliked the feeling because it made me want to kill him now. I found out about you through the Talamasca, he said, assuming the same confidential tone as before. Of course I was familiar with your little fictions. I read all that sort of thing. That\u0027s why I used those short stories to communicate with you. But it was in the archives of the Talamasca that I discovered that your fictions weren\u0027t fictions at all. I was silently enraged that Louis had figured it right. All right, I said. I understand all this about the divided brain and the divided soul, but what if you don\u0027t want to give my body back to me after we\u0027ve made this little switch, and I\u0027m not strong enough to reclaim it; what\u0027s to keep you from making off with my body for good? He was quite still for a moment, and then said with slow measured words: A very large bribe. Ah. Ten million dollars in a bank account waiting for me when I repossess this body. He reached into his coat pocket again and drew out a small plastic card with a thumbnail picture of his new face on it. There was also a clear fingerprint, and his name, Raglan James, and a Washington address. You can arrange it, surely. A fortune that can only be claimed by the man with this face and this fingerprint You don\u0027t think I\u0027d forfeit a fortune of that size, do you Besides, I don\u0027t want your body forever. You don\u0027t even want it forever, do you You\u0027ve been far too eloquent on the subject of your agonies, your angst, your extended and noisy descent into hell, etcetera. No. I only want your body for a little while. There are many bodies out there, waiting for me to take possession of them, many kinds of adventure. I studied the little card. Ten million, I said. That\u0027s quite a price. It\u0027s nothing to you and you know it. You have billions squirreled away in international banks under all your colorful aliases. A creature with your formidable powers can acquire all the riches of the world. It\u0027s only the tawdry vampires of second-rate motion pictures who tramp through eternity living hand to mouth, as we both know. He blotted his lips fastidiously with a linen handkerchief, then drank a gulp of his coffee. I was powerfully intrigued, he said, by your descriptions of the vampire Armand in The Queen of the Damned-how he used his precious powers to acquire wealth, and built his great enterprise, the Night Island, such a lovely name. It rather took my breath away. He smiled, and then went on, the voice amiable and smooth as before. It wasn\u0027t very difficult for me to document and annotate your assertions, you realize, though as we both know, your mysterious comrade has long ago abandoned the Night Island, and has vanished from the realm of computer records-at least as far as I can ascertain. I didn\u0027t say anything. Besides, for what I offer, ten million is a bargain. Who else has made you such an offer There isn\u0027t anyone else-at the moment, that is-who can or will. And suppose / don\u0027t want to switch back at the end of the week? I asked. Suppose I want to be human forever. That\u0027s perfectly fine with me, he said graciously. I can get rid of your body anytime I want. There are lots of others who\u0027ll take it off my hands. He gave me a respectful and admiring smile. What are you going to do with my body? Enjoy it. Enjoy the strength, the power! I\u0027ve had everything the human body has to offer-youth, beauty, resilience. I\u0027ve even been in the body of a woman, you know. And by the way, I don\u0027t recommend that at all. Now I want what you have to offer. He narrowed his eyes and cocked his head. If there were any corporeal angels hanging about, well, I might approach one of them. The Talamasca has no record of angels? He hesitated, then gave a small contained laugh. Angels are pure spirit, Monsieur de Lioncourt, he said. We are talking bodies, no I am addicted to the pleasures of the flesh. And vampires are fleshly monsters, are they not They thrive on blood. Again, a light came into his eyes when he said the word blood. What\u0027s your game? I asked. I mean really. What\u0027s your passion It can\u0027t be the money. What\u0027s the money for What will you buy with it Experiences you haven\u0027t had? Yes, I would say that\u0027s it. Experiences I haven\u0027t had. I\u0027m obviously a sensualist, for want of a better word, but if you must know the truth-and I don\u0027t see why there should be any lies between us-I\u0027m a thief in every respect. I don\u0027t enjoy something unless I bargain for it, trick someone out of it, or steal it. It\u0027s my way of making something out of nothing, you might say, which makes me like God! He stopped as if he were so impressed with what he had just said that he had to catch his breath. His eyes were dancing, and then he looked down at the half-empty coffee cup and gave a long secretive private smile. You do follow my drift, don\u0027t you? he asked. I stole these clothes, he said. Everything in my house in Georgetown is stolen-every piece of furniture, every painting, every little object d\u0027art. Even the house itself is stolen, or shall we say, it was signed over to me amid a morass of false impressions and false hopes. I believe they call it swindling All the same thing. He smiled proudly again, and with such seeming depth of feeling that I was amazed. All the money I possess is stolen. So is the car I drive in Georgetown. So are the airline tickets I used to chase you around the world. I didn\u0027t respond. How strange he was, I thought, intrigued by him and yet still repelled by him, for all his graciousness and seeming honesty. It was an act, but what a nearly perfect act. And then the bewitching face, which seemed with every new revelation to be more mobile and expressive and pliant. I roused myself. There was more I had to know. How did you accomplish that, following me about How did you know where I was? Two ways, to be perfectly frank with you. The first is obvious. I can leave my body for short periods, and during those periods I can search for you over vast distances. But I don\u0027t like that sort of bodiless travel at all. And of course you are not easy to find. You cloak yourself for long periods; then you blaze away in careless visibility; and of course you move about with no discernible pattern. Often by the time I\u0027d located you, and brought my body to the location, you were gone. Then there\u0027s another way, almost as magical-computer systems. You use many aliases. I\u0027ve been able to discover four of them. I\u0027m often not quick enough to catch up with you through the computer. But I can study your tracks. And when you double back again, I know where to close in. I said nothing, merely marveling again at how much he was enjoying all of this. I like your taste in cities, he said. I like your taste in hotels-the Hassler in Rome, the Ritz in Paris, the Stanhope in New York. And of course the Park Central in Miami, lovely little hotel. Oh, don\u0027t get so suspicious. There\u0027s nothing to chasing people through computer systems. There\u0027s nothing to bribing clerks to show you a credit card receipt, or bullying bank employees to reveal things they\u0027ve been told not to reveal. Tricks usually handle it perfectly well. You don\u0027t have to be a preternatural killer to do it. No, not at all. You steal through the computer systems? When I can, he said with a little twist to his mouth. I steal in any fashion. Nothing\u0027s beneath my dignity. But I\u0027m not capable of stealing ten million dollars through any means. If I were, I wouldn\u0027t be here, now, would I I\u0027m not that clever. I\u0027ve been caught twice. I\u0027ve been in prison. That\u0027s where I perfected the means of traveling out of body, since there wasn\u0027t any other way. He made a weary bitter sarcastic smile. Why are you telling me all this? Because your friend David Talbot is going to tell you. And because I think we should understand each other. I\u0027m weary of taking risks. This is the big score, your body-and ten million dollars when I give it up. What is it with you? I asked. This all sounds so petty, so mundane. Ten million is mundane? Yes. You\u0027ve swapped an old body for a new one. You\u0027re young again! And the next step, if I consent, will be my body, my powers. But it\u0027s the money that matters to you. It\u0027s really just the money and nothing else. It\u0027s both! he said sourly and defiantly. They\u0027re very similar. With conscious effort he regained his composure. You don\u0027t realize it because you acquired your wealth and your power simultaneously, he said. Immortality and a great casket full of gold and jewels. Wasn\u0027t that the story You walked out of Magnus\u0027s tower an immortal with a king\u0027s ransom. Or is the story a lie You\u0027re real enough, that\u0027s plain. But I don\u0027t know about all those things you wrote. But you ought to understand what I\u0027m saying. You\u0027re a thief yourself. I felt an immediate flush of anger. Suddenly he was more consummately distasteful than he\u0027d been in that anxious jittering state when we first sat down. I\u0027m not a thief, I said quietly. Yes, you are, he answered with amazing sympathy. You always steal from your victims. You know you do. No, I never do unless... I have to. Have it your way. I think you\u0027re a thief. He leant forward, eyes glittering again, as the soothing measured words continued: You steal the blood you drink, you can\u0027t argue with that. What actually happened with you and the Talamasca? I asked. I told you, he said. The Talamasca threw me out. I was accused of using my gifts to gain information for personal use. I was accused of deception. And of stealing, of course. They were very foolish and shortsighted, your friends in the Talamasca. They underestimated me completely. They should have valued me. They should have studied me. They should have begged me to teach them the things I know. Instead they gave me the boot. Six months\u0027 severance. A pittance. And they refused my last request for first-class passage to America on the Queen Elizabeth 2. It would have been so simple for them to grant my wish. They owed me that much, after the things I\u0027d revealed to them. They should have done it. He sighed, and glanced at me, and then at his coffee. Little things like that matter in this world. They matter very much. I didn\u0027t reply. I looked down at the picture again, at the figure on the deck of the ship, but I\u0027m not sure he took notice of it. He was staring off into the noisy glare of the cafe, eyes dancing over walls and ceiling and occasional tourists and taking note of none. I tried to bargain with them, he said, voice soft and measured as before. If they wanted a few items returned or a few questions answered-you know. But they wouldn\u0027t hear of it, not them! And money means nothing to them, no more than it means to you. They were too mean-spirited to even consider it. They gave me a tourist-class plane ticket, and a check for six months\u0027 pay. Six months\u0027 pay! Oh, I am so very weary of all the little ups and downs! What made you think you could outwit them? I did outwit them, he said, eyes flashing with a little smile. They\u0027re not very careful with their inventories. They have no idea really how many of their little treasures I managed to appropriate. They\u0027ll never guess. Of course you were the real theft-the secret that you existed. Ah, discovering that little vault full of relics was such a stroke of good luck. Understand, I didn\u0027t take anything of your old possessions-rotted frock coats from your very closets in New Orleans, parchments with your fancy signature, why, there was even a locket with a painted miniature of that accursed little child- Watch your tongue, I whispered. He went quiet. I\u0027m sorry. I meant no offense, truly. What locket? I asked, Could he hear the sudden racing of my heart I tried to still it, to keep the warmth from rising again in my face. How meek he looked as he answered. A gold locket on a chain, little oval miniature inside. Oh, I didn\u0027t steal it. I swear to you. I left it there. Ask your friend Talbot. It\u0027s still in the vault. I waited, commanding my heart to be still, and banishing all images of that locket from my mind. Then: The point is, the Talamasca caught you and they put you out. You don\u0027t have to continue insulting me, he said humbly. It\u0027s entirely possible for us to make our little bargain without any unpleasantness. I\u0027m very sorry that I mentioned this locket, I didn\u0027t- I want to think over your proposition, I said. That might be a mistake. Why? Give it a chance! Act quickly. Act now. And remember, please, if you harm me, you\u0027ll throw away this opportunity forever. I\u0027m the only key to this experience; use me or you\u0027ll never know what it\u0027s like to be a human being again. He drew close to me, so close I could feel his breath on my cheek. You\u0027ll never know what it\u0027s like to walk in the sunlight, to enjoy a full meal of real food, to make love to a woman or a man. I want you to leave here now. Get out of this city and never come back. I\u0027ll come to you at this address in Georgetown when I\u0027m ready. And it won\u0027t be for a week this switch. Not the first time at any rate. It will be . . . May I suggest two days? I didn\u0027t answer. What if we start with one day? he asked. If you like it, then we can arrange for a longer time? One day, I said, my voice sounding very strange to me. One period of twenty-four hours ... for the first time. One day and two nights, he said quietly. Let me suggest this coming Wednesday, as soon after sunset as you like. We shall make the second switch early on Friday, before dawn. I didn\u0027t reply. You have this evening and tomorrow evening to make your preparations, he said coaxingly. After the switch you will have all of Wednesday night and the full day Thursday. Of course you\u0027ll have Thursday night as well up until... shall we say, two hours before Friday\u0027s sunrise That ought to be comfortable enough. He studied me keenly, then became more anxious: Oh, and bring one of your passports with you. I don\u0027t care which one. But I want a passport, and a bit of credit plastic, and money in my pockets over and above the ten million. You understand? I didn\u0027t say anything. You know this will work. Again, I didn\u0027t answer. Believe me, all I\u0027ve told you is true. Ask Talbot. I wasn\u0027t born this handsome individual you see before you. And this body is waiting right now this very minute for you. I was quiet. Come to me Wednesday, he said. You\u0027ll be very glad that you did. He paused, and then his manner became even softer. Look, I... feel that I know you, he said, his voice dropping to a whisper. I know what you want! It\u0027s dreadful to want something and not to have it. Ah, but then to know that it\u0027s within your grasp. I looked up slowly into his eyes. The handsome face was tranquil, devoid of any stamp of expression, and the eyes seemed rather miraculous in their fragility and their precision. The skin itself seemed supple and as if it would feel like satin to my touch. And then came the voice again, in a seductive half whisper, the words touched with sadness. This is something only you and I can do, he said. In a way, it is a miracle which only you and I can understand. The face appeared monstrous suddenly in its tranquil beauty; even the voice seemed monstrous in its lovely timbre and eloquence, so expressive of empathy and even affection, perhaps even love. I had the urge to grab the creature by the throat; I had the urge to shake it until it lost its composure and its semblance of deep feeling, but I would not have dreamed of doing so really. I was mesmerized by the eyes and the voice. I was allowing myself to be mesmerized, the way I had allowed those earlier physical sensations of assault to sweep over me. And it occurred to me that I allowed this simply because this being seemed so very fragile and foolish and I was sure of my own strength. But that was a He. I wanted to do this thing! I wanted to make this switch. Only after a long while, he broke away, and let his gaze move over the cafe. Was he biding his time What went on inside his clever conniving, and thoroughly concealed soul! A being who could steal bodies! Who could live inside another\u0027s flesh. Slowly, he took a pen from his pocket, tore loose one of the paper napkins, and wrote down the name and address of a bank. He gave this to me and I took it and slipped it into my pocket. I didn\u0027t speak. Before we switch, I\u0027ll give you my passport, he said, studying me with every word. The one with the correct face on it, of course. I\u0027ll leave you comfortable in my house. I assume you\u0027ll have money in your pockets. You always do. You\u0027ll find it quite cozy, my house. You\u0027ll like Georgetown. His words were like soft fingers tapping the back of my hand, annoying yet vaguely thrilling. It\u0027s quite a civilized place, an old place. Of course it is snowing there. You realize it. It\u0027s very cold. If you really don\u0027t want to do it in a cold climate- I don\u0027t mind about the snow, I said under my breath. Yes, of course. Well, I\u0027ll be sure to leave you quite a few winter garments, he said in the same conciliatory manner. None of those details matter, I said. What a fool he was to think that they did. I could feel my heart skipping beats. Oh, I don\u0027t know about that, he said. When you\u0027re human you might find that a lot of things matter. To you, perhaps, I thought. All that matters to me is to be in that body, and to be alive. In my mind\u0027s eye, I saw the snow of that last winter in the Auvergne. I saw the sun spilling down on the mountains... I saw the little priest from the village church, shivering in the great hall as he complained to me about the wolves coming down into the village at night. Of course I would hunt down the wolves. It was my duty. I didn\u0027t care whether he\u0027d read these thoughts or not. Ah, but don\u0027t you want to taste good food Don\u0027t you want to drink good wine What about a woman, or a man, for that matter You\u0027ll need money and pleasant accommodations, of course. I didn\u0027t reply. I saw the sun on the snow. I let my eyes move slowly to his face. I thought how curiously graceful he seemed in this new mode of persuasiveness, how very like David, indeed. He was about to go on with his talk of luxuries when I gestured for silence. All right, I said. I think you\u0027ll see me on Wednesday. Shall we say an hour after dark Oh, and I must warn you. This fortune often million dollars. It will only be available to you for two hours on Friday morning. You\u0027ll have to appear in person to claim it. And here I touched his shoulder lightly. This person, of course. Of course. I\u0027m looking forward to it. And you\u0027ll need a code word to complete the transaction. And you\u0027ll only learn the code word from me when you return my body as agreed. No. No code words. The transfer of funds must be complete and irrevocable before the bank closes on Wednesday afternoon. All I have to do the following Friday is appear before the representative, allow him to take my fingerprint if you insist upon it, and then he will sign the money over to me. I was quiet, thinking it over. After all, my handsome friend, he said, what if you don\u0027t like your day as a human being What if you don\u0027t feel you\u0027ve gotten your money\u0027s worth? I\u0027ll get my money\u0027s worth, I whispered, more to myself than to him. No, he said patiently but insistently. No code words. I studied him. He smiled at me, and he appeared almost innocent and truly young. Good Lord, it must have meant something to him, this youthful vigor. How could it not have dazzled him, at least for a while In the beginning, perhaps, he must have thought he\u0027d attained everything that he could ever want. Not by a long shot! he said suddenly, as if he couldn\u0027t stop the words from slipping out of his mouth. I couldn\u0027t help but laugh. Let me tell you a little secret about youth, he said with sudden coldness. Bernard Shaw said it was wasted on the young, you remember that clever overrated little remark? Yes. Well, it isn\u0027t. The young know how difficult and truly dreadful youth can be. Their youth is wasted on everyone else, that\u0027s the horror. The young have no authority, no respect. You\u0027re mad, I said. I don\u0027t think you use what you steal very well. How could you not thrill to the sheer stamina Glory in the beauty you see reflected in the eyes of those who look at you everywhere you go? He shook his head. That\u0027s for you to enjoy, he said. The body\u0027s young the way you\u0027ve always been young. You will thrill to the stamina of it, as you say. You will glory in all those loving looks. He broke off. He took the final sip of his coffee and stared into the cup, No code words, he said politely. Very well. Ah, good, he said with a full warm smile of amazing brightness. Remember I offered you a week for this sum, he said. It\u0027s your decision to take one full day. Perhaps after you\u0027ve had a taste you\u0027ll want a much longer time. Perhaps so, I said. Again, I was distracted by the sight of him, by the sight of the large warm hand which he covered now with the glove. And another switch will cost you another handsome sum, he said merrily, all smiles now, as he arranged his scarf within his lapels. Yes, of course. Money really doesn\u0027t mean anything to you, does it? he asked, thoughtfully. Nothing at all. How tragic for you, I thought, that it means so much. Well, perhaps I should take my leave now, and allow you to make your preparations. I shall see you Wednesday as planned. Don\u0027t try to run out on me, I said in a low voice, leaning forward slightly, and then lifting my hand and touching his face. The gesture clearly startled him; he became motionless, like an animal in the wood who suddenly sensed danger where there had been none before. But his expression remained calm, and I let my fingers rest against his smoothly shaven skin. Then I moved them down slowly, feeling the firmness of his jawbone, and then I placed my hand on his neck. Here, too, the razor had passed, leaving its faint dark shadow; the skin was firm, surprisingly muscular, and a clean, youthful scent rose from it as I saw the sweat break out on his forehead, as I saw his lips move in a surprisingly graceful smile. Surely you enjoyed being young just a little, I said under my breath. He smiled, as if he knew just how radiant and seductive the smile could be. I dream the dreams of the young, he said. And they are always dreams of being older, and richer, and wiser, and stronger, don\u0027t you think? I gave a little laugh. I\u0027ll be there Wednesday night, he said with the same silver-tongued sincerity. You can be certain of it. Come. It will happen, I promise you. He leant forward and whispered. You will be inside this body! And once again, he smiled in the most charming and ingratiating fashion. You\u0027ll see. I want you to leave New Orleans now. Ah, yes, immediately, he said. And without another word, he stood up, moving back away from me, and then tried to conceal his sudden fear. I have my ticket already, he said. I don\u0027t like your filthy little Caribbean backwater. He made a little self-deprecating laugh, an almost pretty laugh. Then he went on as if he were a wise teacher scolding a student. We\u0027ll talk more when you come to Georgetown. And don\u0027t try to spy on me in the meantime. I\u0027ll know it if you do. I\u0027m too good at picking up that sort of thing. Even the Talamasca was amazed at my powers. They should have kept me in the fold! They should have studied me! He broke off. I\u0027ll spy on you anyway, I said, echoing his low key and careful tone. I don\u0027t really care whether or not you know. He laughed again, in a low, subdued, and slightly smoldering fashion, and then gave me a little nod and rushed towards the door. He was once again the awkward, ungainly being, full of crazed excitement. And how tragic it seemed, for surely that body could move like a panther with another soul inside. I caught him on the sidewalk, startling him, indeed scaring him half out of his powerful little psychic mind. We were almost eye-to-eye. What do you want to do with my body? I asked. I mean, besides flee from the sun every morning as if you were a nocturnal insect or a giant slug? What do you think? he said, once again playing the charming English gentleman with utter sincerity. I want to drink blood. His eyes grew very wide, and he leaned closer. I want to take life when I drink it. That\u0027s the point, isn\u0027t it It\u0027s not merely the blood you steal from them, it\u0027s their lives. I\u0027ve never stolen anything that valuable from anyone. He gave me a knowing smile. The body, yes, but not the blood and the life. I let him go, backing away from him as sharply as he\u0027d backed away from me only a moment before. My heart was pounding, and I could feel a tremor passing through me as I stared at him, at his handsome and seemingly innocent face. He continued to smile. You are a thief par excellence, he said. Every breath you take is stolen! Oh, yes, I must have your body. I must experience this. To invade the vampire files of the Talamasca was a triumph, but to possess your body, and to steal blood whilst in it! Ah, that is beyond all my finest accomplishments! You are the ultimate thief. Get away from me, I whispered. Oh, come now, don\u0027t be so fastidious, he said. You hate it when other people do it to you. You\u0027re quite privileged, Lestat de Lioncourt. You\u0027ve found what Diogenes was searching for. An honest man! Another broad smile, and then a low volley of simmering laughter, as if he couldn\u0027t contain it any longer. I shall see you Wednesday. And you must come early. I want as much of the night as I can have. He turned and hurried into the street, waving frantically for a taxi, and then bolting against the traffic to force his way into a cab which had just come to a stop, quite obviously, for someone else. A little argument ensued, but he won out immediately, slamming the door in the other fellow\u0027s face as the cab sped off. I saw him wink at me through the dirty window, and wave. And then he and his taxi were gone. I was sick with confusion. I stood there unable to move. The night for all its coldness was busy and full of the mingled voices of the passing tourists, of cars slowing as they passed the square. Without intent, without words, I tried to see it as it might be in the sunshine; I tried to imagine the heavens over this spot that shocking vague blue. Then slowly I turned up the collar of my coat. I walked for hours. I kept hearing that beautiful cultured voice in my ears. It\u0027s not merely the blood you steal from them, it\u0027s their lives. I\u0027ve never stolen anything that valuable from anyone. The body, yes, but not the blood and the life. I couldn\u0027t have faced Louis. I couldn\u0027t bear the thought of talking to David. And if Marius learned of this, I was finished before I\u0027d begun. Who knew what Marius would do to me for even entertaining such an idea And yet Marius, with all his vast experience, would know if this was truth or fancy! Ye gods, had Marius never wanted to do it himself At last, I went back to my apartment, and turned out the lights and sat sprawled on the soft velvet sofa, before the darkened glass wall, peering out at the city below. Remember, please, if you harm me, you\u0027ll throw away this opportunity forever... Use me or you \u0027II never know what it\u0027s like to be a human being again . . . You\u0027ll never know what it\u0027s like to walk in the sunlight, to enjoy a full meal of real food, to make love to a woman or a man. I thought about the power of rising out of one\u0027s material form. I didn\u0027t like this power, and it did not happen to me spontaneously, this astral projection, as it was called, this spirit traveling. Indeed, I had used it so few times I could have counted them on one hand. And in all my suffering in the Gobi, I had not tried to leave my material form, nor had I been propelled out of it, nor had I even thought of such a possibility. Indeed, the idea of being disconnected from my body-of floating about, earthbound, and unable to find a door to heaven or hell-was absolutely terrifying to me. And that such a traveling, disembodied soul could not pass through the gates of death at will had been plain to me the very first time I\u0027d ever experimented with this little trick. But to go into the body of a mortal! To anchor there, to walk, to feel, to see, as a mortal, ah, I could not contain my excitement. It was becoming pure pain. After the switch you will have all of Wednesday night and the full day Thursday. The full day Thursday, the full day ... Finally, sometime before morning, I called my agent in New York. This man had no knowledge of my Paris agent at all. He knew me under two names only. And I had not used either of these in many a moon. It was very unlikely Raglan James had any knowledge of these identities and their various resources. It seemed the simplest route to pursue. I have some work for you, very complicated work. And it must be done immediately. Yes, sir, always, sir. All right, this is the name and address of a bank in the District of Columbia. I want you to write it down . . .","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-body-thief-the-vampire-chronicles-4/page-9.html","bookId":2212,"book":{"id":2212,"title":"The Tale of the Body Thief (The Vampire Chronicles #4)","description":"Storyline: The Tale of the Body Thief (The Vampire Chronicles #4) Lestat speaks.
