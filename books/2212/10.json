{"id":102896,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"NINE\\n\\n THE following evening I completed all the necessary papers for this transfer of ten million in American dollars, and sent these papers by messenger to the bank in Washington, along with Mr. Raglan James\u0027s photo-identification card, and a full reiteration of instructions in my own hand, and with the signature of Lestan Gregor, which for various reasons, was the best name to be used for the entire affair.\\n\\n My New York agent also knew me by another alias, as I have indicated, and we agreed that this other name would in no way figure in this transaction, and that should I need to contact my agent, this other name, and a couple of new code words, would empower him to make transfers of money on verbal instructions alone.\\n\\n As for the name Lestan Gregor, it was to disappear utterly from record as soon as this ten million went into the possession of Mr. James. All the remaining assets of Mr. Gregor were now transferred to my other name-which by the way was Stanford Wilde, for all that it matters now.\\n\\n All of my agents are used to such bizarre instructions-shifts of funds, collapsing of identities, and the authority to wire funds to me anywhere I might be in the world on the basis of a telephone call. But I tightened the system. I gave bizarre and difficult-to-pronounce code words. I did everything I could, in short, to improve security surrounding my identities, and to fix the terms of the transfer of the ten million as firmly as I could.\\n\\n As of Wednesday noon, the money would be in a trust account at the Washington bank, from which it could only be claimed by Mr. Raglan James, and only between the hours of ten and twelve on the following Friday. Mr. James would verify his identity by physical conformity to his picture, and by fingerprint, and by signature, before the money would be placed in his account. At one minute after twelve noon, the entire transaction would be null and void, and the money would be sent back to New York. Mr. James was to be presented with all these terms on Wednesday afternoon at the very latest, and with the assurance that nothing could prevent this transfer if all the instructions were followed as laid out.\\n\\n It seemed an ironclad arrangement, as far as I could figure, but then I wasn\u0027t a thief, contrary to what Mr. James believed. And knowing that he was, I examined all aspects of the deal over and over, rather compulsively, in order to deny him the upper hand.\\n\\n But why was I still deceiving myself, I wondered, that I would not go through with this experiment For surely I intended to do exactly that.\\n\\n Meantime, the phone in my apartment was ringing over and over again, as David tried desperately to reach me, and I sat there in the dark, thinking things over, and refusing to answer, vaguely annoyed by the ringing, and finally unplugging the cord.\\n\\n This was despicable, what I meant to do. This varmint would use my body, no doubt, for the most sinister and cruel crimes. And I was going to allow this to happen, merely so that I could be human How impossible to justify, in any light whatever, to anyone whom I knew.\\n\\n Every time I thought of the others discovering the truth- any of them-I shuddered, and put the thought completely from my mind. Pray they were busy throughout the vast hostile world, with their own inevitable pursuits.\\n\\n How much better to think about the entire proposition with pounding excitement. And Mr. James was right about the matter of money, of course. Ten million meant absolutely nothing to me. I had carried through the centuries a great fortune, increasing it by various offhand means until even I myself did not know its true size.\\n\\n And much as I understood how very different the world was for a mortal being, I still could not quite comprehend why the money was so important to James. After all, we were dealing with questions of potent magic, of vast preternatural power, of potentially devastating spiritual insights, and demonic, if not heroic, deeds. But the money was clearly what the little bastard wanted. The little bastard, for all his insults, did not really see past the money. And perhaps that was just as well.\\n\\n Think how very dangerous he might be had he truly grand ambitions. But he did not.\\n\\n And I wanted that human body. And that was the bottom line.\\n\\n The rest was rationalization at best. And as the hours passed, I did quite a bit of that,\\n\\n For example, was the surrender of my powerful body really so despicable The little creep couldn\u0027t even use the human body he had. He\u0027d turned into the perfect gentleman for half an hour at the cafe table, then blown it with his awkward graceless gestures, as soon as he\u0027d stood up. He\u0027d never be able to use my physical strength. He wouldn\u0027t be able to direct my telekinetic powers either, no matter how psychic he claimed to be. He might do all right with the telepathy, but when it came to\\n\\n entrancing or spellbinding, I suspected he would not even begin to use those gifts. I doubted he would be able to move very fast. Indeed, he\u0027d be clumsy and slow and ineffective. Actual flight probably wouldn\u0027t be a possibility for him. And he might even get himself into a terrible scrape.\\n\\n Yes, it was all well and good that he was such a small-souled miserable little schemer. Better that than a god on a rampage, certainly. As for me, what did I plan to do\\n\\n The house in Georgetown, the car, these things meant nothing! I\u0027d told him the truth. I wanted to be alive! Of course I would need some money for food and drink. But seeing the light of day cost nothing. Indeed, the experience need not involve any great material comfort or luxury. I wanted the spiritual and physical experience of being mortal flesh again. I saw myself as wholly unlike the miserable Body Thief!\\n\\n But I had one remaining doubt. What if ten million wasn\u0027t enough to bring this man back with my body Perhaps I should double the amount. To such a small-minded person, a fortune of twenty million would truly be an enticement. And in the past, I had always found it effective to double the sums which people charged for their services, thereby commanding a loyalty from them of which they had not even conceived.\\n\\n I called New York again. Double the sum. My agent, naturally enough, thought I was losing my mind. We used our new code words to confirm the authority of the transaction. Then I hung up.\\n\\n It was time now to talk to David or go to Georgetown. I had made a promise to David. I sat very still, waiting for the phone to ring, and when it did, I picked it up.\\n\\n Thank God you\u0027re there.\\n\\n What is it? I asked.\\n\\n I recognized the name Raglan James immediately, and you\u0027re absolutely right. The man is not inside his own body! The person you\u0027re dealing with is sixty-seven years old. He was born in India, grew up in London, and has been in prison five times. He\u0027s a thief known to every law enforcement agency in Europe, and what they call in America a confidence man. He\u0027s also a powerful psychic, a black magician-one of the most crafty we\u0027ve ever known.\\n\\n So he told me. He worked his way into the order.\\n\\n Yes, he did. And this was one of the worst mistakes we\u0027ve ever made. But Lestat, this man could seduce the Blessed Virgin, and steal a pocket watch from the Living Lord. Yet he was his own undoing within a matter of months. That\u0027s the crux of what I\u0027m trying to tell you. Now, please do listen. This sort of black witch or sorcerer always brings evil upon himself! With his gifts he should have been able to deceive us forever; instead he used his skill to fleece the other members, and to steal from the vaults!\\n\\n He told me that. What about this whole question of body switching Can there be any doubt?\\n\\n Describe the man as you\u0027ve seen him.\\n\\n I did. I emphasized the height and the robust nature of the physical frame. The thick glossy hair, the uncommonly smooth and satin like skin. The exceptional beauty.\\n\\n Ah, I\u0027m looking at a picture of the man right now.\\n\\n Explain.\\n\\n He was confined briefly in a London hospital for the criminally insane. Mother an Anglo-Indian, which may explain the exceptionally beautiful complexion you\u0027re describing, and which I can see here plainly enough. Father a London cabbie who died in jail. The fellow himself worked in a garage in London, specializing in extremely expensive cars. Dealt in drugs as a sideline so that he could afford the cars himself. One night he murdered his entire family-wife, two children, brother-in-law and mother-and then gave himself up to the police. A frightening mix of hallucinogenic drugs was found in his blood, along with a great deal of alcohol. These were the very same drugs he often sold to the neighborhood youths.\\n\\n Derangement of the senses but nothing wrong with the brain.\\n\\n Precisely, the entire murderous tantrum was drug induced as far as the authorities could see. The man himself never spoke a word after the incident. He remained steadfastly immune to any stimulus until three weeks after his commitment to hospital, at which time he mysteriously escaped, leaving the body of a slain orderly in his room. Can you guess who this slain orderly turned out to be?\\n\\n James.\\n\\n Exactly. Positive identification made postmortem through fingerprints, and confirmed through Interpol and Scotland Yard. James had been working in the hospital under an assumed name for a month before the incident, no doubt waiting for just such a body to arrive!\\n\\n And then he cheerfully murdered his own body. Steely little son of a bitch to do that.\\n\\n Well, it was a very sick body-dying of cancer to be precise. The autopsy revealed he wouldn\u0027t have survived another six months. Lestat, for all we know, James may have contributed to the commission of the crimes which placed the young man\u0027s body at his disposal. If he hadn\u0027t stolen this body, he would have hit upon another in a similar state. And once he\u0027d dealt the death blow to his old body, it went into the grave, don\u0027t you see, carrying James\u0027s entire criminal record with it.\\n\\n Why did he give me his real name, David Why did he tell me he\u0027d belonged to the Talamasca?\\n\\n So I could verify his story, Lestat. Everything he does is calculated. You don\u0027t understand how clever this creature is. He wants you to know that he can do what he says he can do! And that the former owner of that young body is quite unable to interfere.\\n\\n But, David, there are still aspects to this which are baffling. The soul of the other man. Did it die in that old body Why didn\u0027t it... get out!\\n\\n Lestat, the poor being probably never knew such a thing was possible. Undoubtedly James manipulated the switch. Look, I have a file here of testimony from other members of the order pertaining to how this character jolted them right out of the physical and took possession of their bodies for short periods of time.\\n\\n All the sensations you experienced-the vibration, the constriction-were reported by these people as well. But we are speaking here of educated members of the Order of the Talamasca. This garage mechanic had no training in such things.\\n\\n His entire experience with the preternatural had to do with drugs. And God knows what ideas were mixed up with it. And throughout, James was dealing with a man in a severe state of shock.\\n\\n What if it\u0027s all some sort of clever ruse, I said. Describe James to me, the man you knew.\\n\\n Slender, almost emaciated, very vibrant eyes, and thick white hair. Not a bad-looking man. Beautiful voice, as I recall.\\n\\n That\u0027s our man.\\n\\n Lestat, the note you faxed to me from Paris-it leaves no doubt. It\u0027s James\u0027s writing. It\u0027s his signature. Don\u0027t you realize that he found out about you through the order, Lestat! That is the most disturbing aspect of this to me, that he located our files.\\n\\n So he said.\\n\\n He entered the order to gain access to such secrets. He cracked the computer system. There\u0027s no telling what he might have discovered. Yet he couldn\u0027t resist stealing a silver wrist-watch from one of the members, and a diamond necklace from the vaults. He played reckless games with the others. He robbed their rooms. You can\u0027t entertain any further communication with this person! It\u0027s out of the question.\\n\\n You sound like the Superior General, now, David.\\n\\n Lestat, we\u0027re speaking of switching here! That means putting your body, with all its gifts, at the disposal of this man.\\n\\n I know.\\n\\n You cannot do it. And let me make a shocking suggestion. If you do enjoy taking life, Lestat, as you\u0027ve told me, why not murder this revolting individual as soon as you can?\\n\\n David, this is wounded pride talking. And I am shocked.\\n\\n Don\u0027t play with me. There\u0027s no time for it here. You realize that this character is plenty clever enough to be counting upon your volatile nature in this little game He has picked you for this switch just as he picked the poor mechanic in London. He has studied the evidence of your impulsiveness, your curiosity, your general fearlessness. And he can fairly well assume that you won\u0027t listen to a word of warning from me.\\n\\n Interesting.\\n\\n Speak up; I can\u0027t hear you.\\n\\n What else can you tell me?\\n\\n What else do you require!\\n\\n I want to understand this.\\n\\n Why?\\n\\n David, I see your point about the poor befuddled mechanic; nevertheless, why didn\u0027t his soul pop loose from the cancer-riddled body when James dealt it one fine blow to the head?\\n\\n Lestat, you said it yourself. The blow was to the head. The soul was already enmeshed with the new brain. There was no moment of clarity or will in which it could have sprung free. Even with a clever sorcerer like James, if you damage the tissues of the brain severely before the soul has a chance to disengage, it cannot do it, and physical death will follow, taking the entire soul with it out of this world. If you do decide to put an end to this miserable monster, by all means take him by surprise, and see to it that you smash his cranium as you might a raw egg.\\n\\n I laughed. David, I\u0027ve never heard you so incensed.\\n\\n That\u0027s because I know you, and I think you mean to do this switch, and you must not!\\n\\n Answer a few more of my questions. I want to think this through.\\n\\n No.\\n\\n Near-death experiences, David. You know, those poor souls that suffer a heart attack, go up through a tunnel, see a light, and then come back to life. What\u0027s happening with them?\\n\\n Your guess is as good as mine.\\n\\n I don\u0027t believe you. I reported James\u0027s talk of the brain stem and the residual soul, as best I could. In these near-death experiences, has a little bit of the soul remained behind?\\n\\n Perhaps, or maybe these individuals do confront death- they actually do cross over-and yet the soul, whole and entire, is sent back. I don\u0027t know.\\n\\n But whatever the case, you can\u0027t simply die by going out of your body, can you If in the Gobi Desert, I had gone up and out of my body, I couldn\u0027t have found the gateway, could I It wouldn\u0027t have been there. It opens only for the whole soul.\\n\\n Yes. As far as I know, yes. He paused. Then: Why do you ask me this Do you still dream of dying I don\u0027t believe it. You\u0027re too desperately fond of being alive.\\n\\n I\u0027ve been dead for two centuries, David. What about ghosts The earthbound spirits?\\n\\n They\u0027ve failed to find that gateway, even though it opened. Or they refused to go through. Look, we can talk about all this some night in the future, roaming the alleyways of Rio, or wherever you like. The important thing is, you must swear to me not to deal with this sorcerer any longer, if you won\u0027t go so far as to follow my suggestion that you put an end to him as soon as you can.\\n\\n Why are you so afraid of him!\\n\\n Lestat, you must understand how destructive and vicious this individual can be. You can\u0027t give your body over to him! And that is just what you mean to do. Look, if you meant to possess a mortal body for a while, I\u0027d be dead against it, for that is diabolical and unnatural enough! But to give your body to this madman! Ye gods, will you please come here to London Let me talk you out of this. Don\u0027t you owe me as much!\\n\\n David, you investigated him before he became a member of the order, did you not What sort of man is he... I mean how did he become this wizard of sorts?\\n\\n He deceived us with elaborate fabrications and counterfeit records on a scale you wouldn\u0027t believe. He loves that sort of connivance. And he\u0027s something of a computer genius. Our real investigation took place after he\u0027d gone.\\n\\n So Where did it all start?\\n\\n Family was rich, merchant class. Lost its money before the war. Mother was a famous medium, apparently quite legitimate and dedicated, and charged a pittance for her services. Everybody in London knew her. I remember hearing of her, long before I was ever interested in that sort of thing. The Talamasca pronounced her genuine on more than one occasion, but she refused to be studied. She was a fragile creature, and very much loved her only son.\\n\\n Raglan, I said.\\n\\n Yes, She died of cancer. Terrible pain. Her only daughter became a seamstress, still works for a bridal shop in London. Simply exquisite work. She\u0027s deeply grieved over the death of her troublesome brother, but relieved he\u0027s gone. I talked to her this morning. She said her brother had been destroyed when he was quite young, by their mother\u0027s death.\\n\\n Understandable, I said.\\n\\n Father worked almost all his life for Cunard shipping, spending his last years as a cabin steward in first class on the Queen Elizabeth 2. Very proud of his record. Great scandal and disgrace not so many years ago, when James was also hired, thanks to the influence of his father, and promptly robbed one of the passengers of four hundred pounds in cash. Father disowned him, was reinstated by Cunard before he died. Never spoke to his son again.\\n\\n Ah, the photograph on the ship, I said.\\n\\n What?\\n\\n And when you expelled him, he had wanted to sail on that very vessel back to America . . . first class, of course.\\n\\n He told you that It\u0027s possible. I didn\u0027t really handle the particulars myself.\\n\\n Not important, go on. How did he get into the occult?\\n\\n He was highly educated, spent years at Oxford, though at times he had to live like a pauper. Started dabbling in medium-ship even before his mother died. Didn\u0027t come into his own until the fifties, in Paris, where he soon acquired an enormous following, then started bilking his clients in the most crude and obvious ways imaginable, and went to jail.\\n\\n Same thing happened later in Oslo, more or less. After a series of odd jobs, including very menial work, he started some sort of a spiritualist church, swindled a widow out of her life savings, and was deported. Then Vienna, where he worked as a waiter in a first-class hotel until he became a psychic counselor to the rich within a matter of weeks. Soon a hasty departure. He barely escaped arrest. In Milan, he bilked a member of the old aristocracy out of thousands before he was discovered, and had to leave the city in the middle of the night. His next stop was Berlin, where he was arrested but talked himself out of custody, and then back to London, where he went to jail again.\\n\\n Ups and downs, I said, remembering his words.\\n\\n That\u0027s always the pattern. He rises from the lowest employment to living in extravagant luxury, running up ludicrous accounts for fine clothing, motorcars, jet excursions here and there, and then it all collapses in the face of his petty crimes, treachery, and betrayal. He can\u0027t break the cycle. It always brings him down.\\n\\n So it seems.\\n\\n Lestat, there is something positively stupid about this creature. He speaks eight languages, can invade any computer network, and possess other people\u0027s bodies long enough to loot their wall safes-he is obsessed with wall safes, by the way, hi an almost erotic fashion!-and yet he plays silly tricks on people and ends up with handcuffs on his wrists! The objects he took from our vaults were nearly impossible for him to sell. He ended up dumping them on the black market for a pittance. He\u0027s really something of an arch fool.\\n\\n I laughed under my breath. The thefts are symbolic, David. This is a creature of compulsion and obsession. It\u0027s a game. That\u0027s why he cannot hang on to what he steals. It\u0027s the process that counts with him, more than anything else.\\n\\n But, Lestat, it\u0027s an endlessly destructive game.\\n\\n I understand, David. Thank you for this information. I\u0027ll call you soon.\\n\\n Wait just a minute, you can\u0027t ring off, I won\u0027t allow it, don\u0027t you realize-\\n\\n Of course I do, David.\\n\\n Lestat, there is a saying in the world of the occult. Like attracts like. Do you know what it means?\\n\\n What would I know about the occult, David That\u0027s your territory, not mine.\\n\\n This is no time for sarcasm.\\n\\n I\u0027m sorry. What does it mean?\\n\\n When a sorcerer uses his powers in a petty and selfish fashion, the magic always rebounds upon him.\\n\\n Now you\u0027re talking superstition.\\n\\n I am talking a principle which is as old as magic itself.\\n\\n He isn\u0027t a magician, David, he\u0027s merely a creature with certain measurable and definable psychic powers. He can possess other people. In one case of which we know, he effected an actual switch.\\n\\n It\u0027s the same thing! Use those powers to try to harm others and the harm comes back to oneself.\\n\\n David, I am the extant proof that such a concept is false. Next you will explain the concept of karma to me and I will slowly drop off to sleep.\\n\\n James is the quintessential evil sorcerer! He\u0027s already defeated death once at the expense of another human being; he must be stopped.\\n\\n Why didn\u0027t you try to stop me, David, when you had the opportunity I was at your mercy at Talbot Manor. You could have found some way.\\n\\n Don\u0027t push me away with your accusations!\\n\\n I love you, David. I will contact you soon. I was about to put down the phone, when I thought of something. David, I said. There\u0027s something else I\u0027d like to know.\\n\\n Yes, what? Such relief that I hadn\u0027t hung up.\\n\\n You have these relics of ours-old possessions in your vaults.\\n\\n Yes. Discomfort. This was an embarrassment to him, it seemed.\\n\\n A locket, I said, a locket with a picture of Claudia, you have seen such a thing?\\n\\n I believe I have, he said. I verified the inventory of all of those items after you first came to me. I believe there was a locket. I\u0027m almost certain, in fact. I should have told you this, shouldn\u0027t I, before now?\\n\\n No. Doesn\u0027t matter. Was it a locket on a chain, such as women wear?\\n\\n Yes. Do you want me to look for this locket If I find it, I shall give it to you, of course.\\n\\n No, don\u0027t look for it now. Perhaps sometime in the future. Good-bye, David. I\u0027ll come to you soon.\\n\\n I hung up, and removed the small phone plug from the wall. So there had been a locket, a woman\u0027s locket. But for whom had such a thing been made And why did I see it in my dreams Claudia would not have carried her own image with her in a locket. And surely I would remember it if she had. As I tried to envision it, or remember it, I was filled with a peculiar combination of sadness and dread. It seemed I was very near a dark place, a place full of actual death. And as so often happens with my memories, I heard laughter. Only it wasn\u0027t Claudia\u0027s laughter this time. It was mine. I had a sense of preternatural youth and endless possibility. In other words I was remembering the young vampire I\u0027d been in the old days of the eighteenth century before time had dealt its blows.\\n\\n Well, what did I care about this damned locket Maybe I\u0027d picked up the image from James\u0027s brain as he pursued me. It had been for him merely a tool to ensnare me. And the fact was, I\u0027d never even seen such a locket. He would have done better to pick some other trinket that had once belonged to me.\\n\\n No, that last explanation seemed too simple. The image was too vivid. And I\u0027d seen it in my dreams before James had made his way into my adventures. I grew angry suddenly. I had other things to consider just now, did I not Get thee behind me, Claudia. Take your locket, please, ma cherie, and go.\\n\\n For a very long time, I sat still in the shadows, conscious that the clock was ticking on the mantel, and listening to the occasional noise of traffic from the street.\\n\\n I tried to consider the points David had made to me. I tried. But all I was thinking was ... so James can do it, really do it. He is the white-haired man in the photograph, and he did switch with the mechanic in the hospital in London. It can be done!\\n\\n Now and then I saw the locket in my mind\u0027s eye-1 saw the miniature of Claudia painted so artfully in oils. But no emotion came to me, no sorrow, no anger, no grief.\\n\\n It was James upon whom my entire heart was fastened. James can do it! James isn\u0027t lying. I can live and breathe in that body! And when the sun rises over Georgetown on that morning, I shall see it with those eyes.\\n\\n It was an hour after midnight when I reached Georgetown. A heavy snow had been falling all evening long, and the streets were filled with deep white drifts of it, clean and beautiful; and it was banked against the doors of the houses, and etching in white the fancy black iron railings and the deep window ledges here and there.\\n\\n The town itself was immaculate and very charming-made up of graceful Federal-style buildings, mostly of wood, which had the clean lines of the eighteenth century, with its penchant for order and balance, though many had been built in the early decades of the nineteenth. I roamed for a long time along deserted M Street, with its many commercial establishments, and then through the silent campus of the nearby university, and then through the cheerfully lighted hillside streets.\\n\\n The town house of Raglan James was a particularly fine structure, made of red brick and built right on the street. It had a pretty center doorway and a hefty brass knocker, and two cheerful flickering gas lamps. Old-fashioned solid shutters graced the windows, and there was a lovely fanlight over the door.\\n\\n The windows were clean, in spite of the snow on the sills, and I could see into the bright and orderly rooms. There was a smart look to the interior-trim white leather furnishings of extreme modern severity and obvious expense. Numerous paintings on the walls-Picasso, de Kooning, Jasper Johns, Andy Warhol-and intermingled with these multimillion dollar canvases, several large expensively mounted photographs of modern ships. Indeed there were several replicas of large ocean liners in glass cases in the lower hall. The floors gleamed with plastic lacquer. Small dark Oriental rugs of geometric design were everywhere, and the many ornaments gracing glass tables and inlaid teak cabinets were almost exclusively Chinese.\\n\\n Meticulous, fashionable, costly, and highly individual-that was the personality of the place. It looked to me the way the dwellings of mortals always did-like a series of pristine stage sets. Quite impossible to believe I could be mortal, and belong in such a house, even for an hour or more.\\n\\n Indeed, the small rooms were so polished it seemed impossible that anyone actually inhabited them at all. The kitchen was full of gleaming copper pots, and black glass-doored appliances, cabinets without visible handles to open them, and bright red ceramic plates.\\n\\n In spite of the hour, James himself was nowhere to be found.\\n\\n I entered the house.\\n\\n A second storey held the bedroom, with a low modern bed, no more than a wooden frame with a mattress inside it, and covered with a quilt of bright geometric pattern, and numerous white pillows-as austere and elegant as all the rest. The closet was crammed with expensive garments, and so were the drawers of the Chinese bureau and another small hand-carved chest by the bed.\\n\\n Other rooms lay empty, but nowhere was there evidence of neglect. I saw no computers here either. No doubt he kept these someplace else.\\n\\n In one of these rooms, I concealed a great deal of money for my later use, hiding it inside the chimney of the unused fireplace.\\n\\n I also concealed some money in an unused bathroom, behind a mirror on the wall.\\n\\n These were simple precautions. I really couldn\u0027t conceive of what it would be like to be human. I might feel quite helpless. Just didn\u0027t know.\\n\\n After I made these little arrangements, I went up on the roof. I could see James at the base of the hill, just turning the comer from M Street, a load of parcels in his arms. He\u0027d been up to thievery, no doubt, for there was no place to shop in these slow hours before dawn. I lost sight of him as he started his ascent.\\n\\n But another strange visitor appeared, without making the slightest sound that a mortal could hear. It was a great dog, seeming to materialize out of nowhere, which made its way back the alleyway and to the rear yard.\\n\\n I\u0027d caught its scent as soon as it approached, but I did not see the animal until I came over the roof to the back of the house. I\u0027d expected to hear from it before this time, for surely it would pick up my scent, know instinctively that I wasn\u0027t human, and then begin to sound its natural alarm of growls and barks.\\n\\n Dogs had done that enough to me over the centuries, though they don\u0027t always. Sometimes I can entrance them and command them. But I feared the instinctive rejection and it always sent a pain through my heart.\\n\\n This dog had not barked or given any clue that he knew I was there. He was staring intently at the rear door of the house and the butter-yellow squares of light falling from the window of the door onto the deep snow.\\n\\n I had a good chance to study him in undisturbed silence, and he was, very simply, one of the most handsome dogs I had ever beheld.\\n\\n He was covered in deep, plush fur, beautifully golden and gray in places, and overlaid with a faint saddle of longer black hairs. His overall shape was that of a wolf, but he was far too big to be a wolf, and there was nothing furtive and sly about him, as is the case with wolves. On the contrary, he was wholly majestic in the way that he sat staring motionless at the door.\\n\\n On closer inspection, I saw that he most truly resembled a giant German shepherd, with the characteristic black muzzle and alert face.\\n\\n Indeed, when I drew close to the edge of the roof, and he at last looked up at me, I found myself vaguely thrilled by the fierce intelligence gleaming in his dark almond-shaped eyes.\\n\\n Still he gave no bark, no growl. There seemed a near-human comprehension in him. But how could that explain his silence I had done nothing to enthrall him, to lure or befuddle his dog mind. No. No instinctive aversion at all.\\n\\n I dropped down into the snow in front of him, and he merely continued to look at me, with those uncanny and expressive eyes. Indeed, so large was he and so calm and sure of himself, that I laughed to myself with delight as I looked at him. I couldn\u0027t resist reaching out to touch the soft fur between his ears.\\n\\n He cocked his head to one side as he continued to look at me, and I found this very endearing, and then to my further amazement he lifted his immense paw and stroked my coat. His bones were so big and heavy he put me in mind of my mastiffs of long ago. He had their slow heavy grace as he moved. I reached out to embrace him, loving his strength and his heaviness, and he reared back on his hind legs and threw his huge paws up on my shoulders, and ran his great ham-pink tongue over my face.\\n\\n This produced in me a wonderful happiness, really near to weeping, and then some giddy laughter. I nuzzled him, and held him, and stroked him, loving his clean furry smell, and kissing him all over his black muzzle, and then looking him in the eye.\\n\\n Ah, this is what Little Red Riding Hood saw, I thought, when she beheld the wolf in her grandmother\u0027s nightcap and gown. It was too funny, really, the extraordinary and keen expression in his dark face.\\n\\n Why don\u0027t you know me for what I am? I asked. And then as he sank back down to a majestic sitting position, and looked up at me almost obediently, it struck me that this was an omen, this dog.\\n\\n No, omen is not the proper word. This did not come from anyone, this gift. It was merely something which put me more in mind of what I meant to do and why I meant to do it, and how little I really cared about the risks involved.\\n\\n I stood beside the dog, petting him and stroking him and moments passed. It was a small garden, and the snow was falling again, deepening around us, and the cold pain in my skin was growing deeper too. The trees were bare and black in the silent storm. Whatever flowers or grass there might have been was of course not visible; but a few garden statues of darkened concrete and a sharp, thick shrubbery-now nothing but bare twigs and snow-marked a clear rectangular pattern to the whole.\\n\\n I must have been there with the dog perhaps three minutes before my hand discovered the round silver disk dangling from his chain-link collar, and finally I gathered this up and held it to the light.\\n\\n Mojo. Ah, I knew this word. Mojo. It had to do with voodoo, gris-gris, charms. Mojo was a good charm, a protective charm. I approved of it as a name for a dog; it was splendid, in fact, and when I called him Mojo he became faintly excited and once again stroked me slowly with his big eager paw.\\n\\n Mojo, is it? I said again. That\u0027s very beautiful. I kissed him and felt the leathery black tip of his nose. There was something else written on the disk, however. It was the address of this house.\\n\\n Very suddenly the dog stiffened; it moved slowly and gracefully out of the sitting position and into an alert stance. James was coming. I heard his crunching steps in the snow. I heard the sound of his key in the lock of his front door. I sensed him realize suddenly that I was very near.\\n\\n The dog gave a deep fierce growl and moved slowly closer to the rear door of the house. There came the sound of the boards inside creaking under James\u0027s heavy feet.\\n\\n The dog gave a deep angry bark. James opened the door, fixed his fierce crazy eyes on me, smiled, and then hurled something heavy at the animal which it easily dodged.\\n\\n Glad to see you! But you\u0027re early, he said.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t answer him. The dog was growling at him in the same menacing fashion and he gave his attention to the animal again, with great annoyance.\\n\\n Get rid of it! he .said, purely furious. Kill it!\\n\\n You\u0027re talking to me? I asked coldly. I laid my hand on the animal\u0027s head again, stroking it, and whispering to it to be still. It drew closer to me, rubbing its heavy flank against me and then seated itself beside me.\\n\\n James was tense and shivering as he watched all this. Suddenly he pushed up his collar against the wind, and folded his arms. The snow was blowing all over him, like white powder, clinging to his brown eyebrows and his hair.\\n\\n It belongs to this house, doesn\u0027t it? I said coldly. This house which you stole.\\n\\n He regarded me with obvious hatred, and then flashed one of those awful evil smiles. I truly wished he\u0027d lapse back into being the English gentleman. It was so much easier for me when he did. It crossed my mind that it was absolutely base to have to deal with him. I wondered if Saul had found the Witch of Endor so distasteful. But the body, ah, the body, how splendid it was.\\n\\n Even in his resentment, with his eyes fixed upon the dog, he could not wholly disfigure the beauty of the body.\\n\\n Well, it seems you\u0027ve stolen the dog too, I said.\\n\\n I\u0027ll get rid of it, he whispered, looking at it again with fierce contempt. And you, where do things stand with you I won\u0027t give you forever to make up your mind. You\u0027ve given me no certain answer. I want an answer now.\\n\\n Go to your bank tomorrow morning, I said. I\u0027ll see you after dark. Ah, but there is one more condition.\\n\\n What is it! he asked between his clenched teeth.\\n\\n Feed the animal. Give it some meat.\\n\\n Then I made my exit so swiftly he couldn\u0027t see it, and when I glanced back, I could see Mojo gazing up at me, through the snowy darkness, and I smiled to think that the dog had seen my movement, fast as it was. The last sound I heard was James cursing to himself ungracefully as he slammed the back door.\\n\\n An hour later, I lay in the dark waiting for the sun above, and thinking again of my youth in France, of the dogs lying beside me, of riding out on that last hunt with those two huge mastiffs, picking their way slowly through the deep snow.\\n\\n And the face of the vampire peering at me from the darkness in Paris, calling me Wolfkiller with such reverence, such crazed reverence, before he sank his fangs into my neck.\\n\\n Mojo, an omen.\\n\\n So we reach into the raging chaos, and we pluck some small glittering thing, and we cling to it, and tell ourselves it has meaning, and that the world is good, and we are not evil, and we will all go home in the end.\\n\\n Tomorrow night, I thought, if that bastard has been lying, I shall split open his chest and tear out his beating heart, and feed it to that big beautiful dog.\\n\\n Whatever happens, I shall keep this dog.\\n\\n And I did.\\n\\n And before this story moves any further, let me say something about this dog. He isn\u0027t going to do anything in this book.\\n\\n He won\u0027t save a drowning baby, or rush into a burning building to rouse the inhabitants from near-fatal sleep. He isn\u0027t possessed by an evil spirit; he isn\u0027t a vampire dog. He\u0027s in this narrative simply because I found him in the snow behind that town house in Georgetown, and I loved him, and from that first moment, he seemed somehow to love me. It was all too true to the blind and merciless laws I believe in-the laws of nature, as men say; or the laws of the Savage Garden, as I call them myself. Mojo loved my strength; I loved his beauty. And nothing else ever really mattered at all. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-body-thief-the-vampire-chronicles-4/page-10.html","bookId":2212,"book":{"id":2212,"title":"The Tale of the Body Thief (The Vampire Chronicles #4)","description":"Storyline: The Tale of the Body Thief (The Vampire Chronicles #4) \\n Lestat speaks.
