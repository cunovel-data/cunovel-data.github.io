{"id":102891,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"FOUR\\n\\n TWILIGHT. The pain was still very great. I didn\u0027t want to move. The skin on my chest and on my legs was tightening and tingling and this only gave variation to the pain.\\n\\n Even the blood thirst, raging fiercely, and the smell of the blood of the servants in the house couldn\u0027t make me move. I knew David was there, but I didn\u0027t speak to him. I thought if I tried to speak, I would weep on account of the pain.\\n\\n I slept and I know that I dreamed, but I couldn\u0027t remember the dreams when next I opened my eyes. I would see the oil lamp again, and the light still frightened me. And so did her voice.\\n\\n Once I woke talking to her in the darkness. Why you of all people Why you in my dreams Where\u0027s your bloody knife?\\n\\n I was grateful when the dawn came. I had sometimes deliberately clamped my mouth shut not to cry out over the pain.\\n\\n When I woke the second night, the pain was not very great. My body was sore all over, perhaps what mortals call raw. But the agony was clearly past. I was lying still on the tiger, and the room felt just a little uncomfortably cold.\\n\\n There were logs stacked in the stone fireplace, set way back under the broken arch, against the blackened bricks. The kindling was all there, with a bit of rumpled newspaper. All in readiness. Hmmm. Someone had come dangerously close to me in my sleep. I hoped to heaven I had not reached out, as we sometimes do in our trance, and pinioned this poor creature.\\n\\n I closed my eyes and listened. Snow falling on the roof, snow tumbling down into the chimney. I opened my eyes again and saw the gleaming bits of moisture on the logs.\\n\\n Then I concentrated, and felt the energy leap out from me like a long thin tongue and touch the kindling, which burst at once into tiny dancing flames. The thick crusted surface of the logs began to warm and then blister. The fire was on its way.\\n\\n I felt a sudden flush of exquisite pain in my cheeks and on my forehead as the light grew brighter. Interesting. I climbed to my knees and stood up, alone in the room. I looked at the brass lamp beside David\u0027s chair. With a tiny soundless mental twist, I turned it on.\\n\\n There were clothes on the chair, a pair of new pants of thick soft dark flannel, a white cotton shirt, and a rather shapeless jacket of old wool. All these clothes were a little too big. They had been David\u0027s clothes. Even the fur-lined slippers were too big. But I wanted to be dressed. There were some undistinguished cotton undergarments also, of the kind everyone wears in the twentieth century, and a comb for my hair.\\n\\n I took my time with everything, noting only a throbbing soreness as I pulled the cloth over my skin. My scalp hurt when I combed my hair. Finally I simply shook it until all the sand and dust was out of it, tumbling down into the thick carpet, and disappearing conveniently enough from view. Putting on the slippers was very nice. But what I wanted now was a mirror.\\n\\n I found one in the hallway, an old dark mirror in a heavy gilded frame. Enough light came from the open library door for me to see myself fairly well.\\n\\n For a moment, I could not quite believe what I beheld. My skin was smooth all over, as completely unblemished as it had ever been. But it was an amber color now, the very color of the frame of the mirror, and gleaming only slightly, no more than that of a mortal who had spent a long luxurious sojourn in tropical seas.\\n\\n My eyebrows and eyelashes shone brightly, as is always the case with the blond hair of such sun-browned individuals, and the few lines of my face, left to me by the Dark Gift, were a little bit more deeply etched than before. I refer here to two small commas at the corners of my mouth, the result of smiling so much when I was alive; and to a few very fine lines at the corners of my eyes, and the trace of a line or two across my forehead. Very nice to have them back for I had not seen them in a long time.\\n\\n My hands had suffered more. They were darker than my face, and very human-looking, with many little creases, which put me in mind at once of how many fine wrinkles mortal hands do have.\\n\\n The nails still glistened in a manner that might alarm humans, but it would be a simple thing to rub a bit of ash over them. My eyes, of course, were another matter. Never had they seemed so bright and so iridescent. But a pair of smoke-colored glasses was all that I needed there. The bigger mask of black glasses was no longer necessary to cover up the shining white skin.\\n\\n Ye gods, how perfectly wonderful, I thought, staring at my own reflection. You look almost like a man! Almost like a man! I could feel a dull ache all over in these burnt tissues, but that felt good to me, as if it were reminding me of the shape of my body, and its human limits.\\n\\n I could have shouted. Instead I prayed. May this last, and if it doesn\u0027t I\u0027d go through it all again.\\n\\n Then it occurred to me, rather crushingly-I was supposed to be destroying myself, not perfecting my appearance so that I could move around better among men. I was supposed to be dying. And if the sun over the Gobi Desert hadn\u0027t done it... if all the long day of lying in the sun, and then the second sunrise . . .\\n\\n Ah, but you coward, I thought, you could have found some way to stay above the surface for that second day! Or could you\\n\\n Well, thank God you chose to come back.\\n\\n I turned and saw David coming down the hall. He had only just returned home, his dark heavy coat was wet from the snow, and he hadn\u0027t even removed his boots.\\n\\n He came to an abrupt halt and inspected me from head to toe, straining to see in the shadows. Ah, the clothes will do, he said. Good Lord, you look like one of those beachcombers, those surf people, those young men who live eternally in resorts.\\n\\n I smiled.\\n\\n He reached out, rather bravely, I thought, and took my hand and led me into the library, where the fire was quite vigorously burning by now. He studied me once again.\\n\\n There\u0027s no more pain, he said tentatively.\\n\\n There is sensation, but it\u0027s not exactly what we call pain. I\u0027m going out for a little while. Oh, don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll be back. I\u0027m thirsting. I have to hunt.\\n\\n His face went blank, but not so blank that I didn\u0027t see the blood in his cheeks, or all the tiny vessels in his eyes.\\n\\n Well, what did you think? I asked. That I\u0027d given it up?\\n\\n No, of course not.\\n\\n Well, then, care to come and watch?\\n\\n He said nothing, but I could see I\u0027d frightened him.\\n\\n You must remember what I am, I said. When you help me, you help the devil. I made a little gesture to his copy of Faust, still lying on the table. And there was that Lovecraft story. Hmmm.\\n\\n You don\u0027t have to take life to do it, do you? he asked quite seriously.\\n\\n But what a crude question.\\n\\n I made a short derisive noise. I like to take life, I said. I gestured to the tiger. I\u0027m a hunter as you were once. I think it\u0027s fun.\\n\\n He looked at me for a long moment, his face full of a sort of troubled wonder and then he nodded slowly as if accepting this. But he was very far from accepting it.\\n\\n Have your supper while I\u0027m gone, I said. I can tell you\u0027re hungry. I can smell meat cooking somewhere in this house. And you can be certain that I intend to have my supper before I come back.\\n\\n You\u0027re quite determined that I\u0027m to know you, aren\u0027t you? he asked. That there\u0027s to be no sentimentality or mistake.\\n\\n Exactly. I drew back my lips and showed him my fangs for a second. They are very small, actually, nothing compared to the leopard and the tiger, with which he kept company so obviously by choice. But this grimace always frightens mortals. It does more than frighten them. It actually shocks them. I think it sends some primal message of alarm through the organism which has little to do with its conscious courage or sophistication.\\n\\n He blanched. He stood quite motionless, looking at me, and then gradually the warmth and the expression returned to his face.\\n\\n Very welt, he said. I\u0027ll be here when you come back. If you don\u0027t come back, I\u0027ll be furious! I won\u0027t speak to you again, I swear it. You vanish on me tonight, you\u0027ll never get another nod from me. It will be a crime against hospitality. You understand?\\n\\n All right, all right! I said with a shrug, though I was secretly touched that he wanted me here. I hadn\u0027t really been so sure, and I\u0027d been so rude to him. I\u0027ll come back. Besides, I want to know.\\n\\n What?\\n\\n Why you aren\u0027t afraid of dying.\\n\\n Well, you aren\u0027t afraid of it, are you?\\n\\n I didn\u0027t answer. I saw the sun again, the great fiery ball becoming earth and sky, and I shuddered. Then I saw that oil lamp in my dream.\\n\\n What is it? he asked.\\n\\n I am afraid of dying, I said with a nod for emphasis. All my illusions are being shattered.\\n\\n You have illusions? he asked quite honestly.\\n\\n Of course I do. One of my illusions was that no one could really refuse the Dark Gift, not knowingly ...\\n\\n Lestat, must I remind you that you refused it yourself?\\n\\n David, I was a boy. I was being forced. I fought instinctively. But that had nothing to do with knowing.\\n\\n Don\u0027t sell yourself short, I think you would have refused even if you had fully understood.\\n\\n Now we\u0027re speaking about your illusions, I said. I\u0027m hungry. Get out of my way or I\u0027ll kill you.\\n\\n I don\u0027t believe you. You had better come back.\\n\\n I will. This time I\u0027ll keep the promise I made in my letter. You can say all you have to say.\\n\\n I hunted the back streets of London. I was wandering near Charing Cross Station, looking for some petty cutthroat that would yield a mouthful even if his narrow little ambitions did sour my soul. But it didn\u0027t quite turn out that way.\\n\\n There was an old woman walking there, shuffling along in a soiled coat, her feet bound with rags. Mad and bitter cold she was, and almost certain to die before morning, having stolen out of the back door of some place where they\u0027d tried to lock her up, or so she bawled to the world in general, determined never to be caught again.\\n\\n We made grand lovers! She had a name for me and a great warm cluster of memories, and there we were dancing in the gutter together, she and I, and I held her a long time in my arms. She was very well nourished, as so many beggars are in this century where food is so plentiful in the Western countries, and I drank slowly, oh, so slowly, savoring it, and feeling a rush all through my burnt skin.\\n\\n When it was finished, I realized that I was experiencing the cold very keenly and had been all along. I was feeling all fluctuations of temperature with greater acuity. Interesting.\\n\\n The wind was lashing me and I hated it. Maybe something of my flesh had actually been burnt off. I didn\u0027t know. I felt the wet cold in my feet, and my hands hurt so much I had to bury them in my pockets. I caught those memories again of the French winter of my last year at home, of the young mortal country lord with a bed of hay, and only the dogs for companions. All the blood in the world seemed not enough suddenly. Time to feed again, and again.\\n\\n They were derelicts, all of them, lured into the icy darkness from their shacks of trash and cardboard, and doomed, or so I told myself, moaning and feasting amid the stench of rancid sweat and urine, and phlegm. But the blood was blood.\\n\\n When the clocks struck ten, I was still thirsting, and victims were still plentiful, but I was tired of it, and it didn\u0027t matter anymore.\\n\\n I traveled for many blocks, into the fashionable West End, and there entered a dark little shop, full of smart, finely cut garments for gentlemen-ah, the ready-made wealth of these years-and outfitted myself to my taste in gray tweed pants and belted coat, with a thick white wool sweater, and even a pair of very pale green tinted glasses with delicate gold frames. Then off I wandered, back into the chill night full of swirling snowflakes, singing to myself and doing a little tap dance under the street lamp just as I used to do for Claudia and-\\n\\n Slam! Bang! Up stepped this fierce and beautiful young tough with wine on his breath, divinely sleazy, who drew a knife on me, all set to murder me for the money I didn\u0027t have, which reminded me that I was a miserable thief for having just stolen a wardrobe of fine Irish clothes. Hmmm. But I was lost again in the tight hot embrace, crushing the bastard\u0027s ribs, sucking him dry as a dead rat in a summer attic, and he went down in amazement and ecstasy, one hand clutching painfully, to the very last, at my hair.\\n\\n He did have some money in his pockets. What luck. I put that in the clothier\u0027s for the garments I\u0027d taken, which seemed more than adequate when I did my arithmetic, at which I am not so good, preternatural powers or no. Then I wrote a little note of thanks, unsigned, of course. And I locked up the shop door tight with a few little telepathic twists, and off I went again. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-body-thief-the-vampire-chronicles-4/page-5.html","bookId":2212,"book":{"id":2212,"title":"The Tale of the Body Thief (The Vampire Chronicles #4)","description":"Storyline: The Tale of the Body Thief (The Vampire Chronicles #4) \\n Lestat speaks.
