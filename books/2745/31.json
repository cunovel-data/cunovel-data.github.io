It’s all I’ve thought about since you were walking down the aisle to me.”\n “You look very hot in your tux. I can’t believe that you wore one.”\n “Have you met our mothers, baby?” I ask, looking at her seriously. “If I didn’t put the thing on, they would have dressed me themselves.”\n “You’re right; I’m surprised they didn’t fuss when I picked my own dress.”\n “I would have fought them for you.” I wrap her closer, one hand on her lower back, the other on the side of her face, holding her close to my body as we continue to sway to the music. When the song ends, my dad takes Liz away from me, while I take Liz’s mom’s hand for a dance.\n “Thank you,” she smiles softly, looking up at me.\n “For what?”\n “Loving my daughter.”\n “It’s easy,” I tell her, bending down to kiss her cheek. When the song ends, Liz and I make our way to the table that is holding the cake. Everyone gathers around as we each take a small piece. I feed her the piece I’m holding, making sure that I get it all in her mouth and none on her face. When I bend low for her to give me mine, she touches my nose with it, catching me off guard; my mouth is open, so she shoves the piece in, laughing hysterically then turns to run. But Cash, Asher, and Nico are all blocking her path. Everyone around us starts laughing, and Liz turns back around to face me. I haven’t even moved to wipe the icing from my nose.\n “Sorry,” she laughs. “Um, you have something right here.” She points to her nose. I nod in understanding. “Do you want me to get it?” she asks sweetly.\n “Come here baby,” I say, making sure my voice is the soft but demanding tone that I know drives her crazy.\n She shakes her head no.\n “Come here.” She takes a step towards me, biting her lip. When she gets close enough for me to grab, I lunge, wrapping my arm around her waist. She’s bent back over my arm, and I wipe the icing on my nose down her neck, and then proceed to lick it all off her. I listen to her laughing the whole time. “You taste so much better than the cake, baby,” I tell her, kissing her lips and hearing everyone applaud.\n “I can’t believe this whole place is ours for the next week,” Liz says, as we look out over the forest and lake below. After the reception, we got in my truck, and everyone waved glow sticks and threw confetti as we drove away. We had already packed for our week-long honeymoon, our bags in the back of my truck, but we wouldn’t need a lot of clothes since I planned on taking advantage of the privacy at our family’s Gatlinburg cabin.\n “You want to go in the hot tub?”\n “Yes, but first I need help getting out of this dress.”\n “I’m more than happy to help you get out of this dress,” I tell her, picking her up and heading inside to the bedroom. Once there, I watch as she pulls a small string that is tied into the waist of her dress, causing the whole bottom half of her dress to drop to the floor at her feet. “Holy shit.” I can’t take my eyes away. She still has the top of her dress on that looks like a corset. Everything she’s wearing is white. In my mind, it contrasts with how unbelievably sexy she looks in her corset, a pair of white silk panties, and white silk stockings with a thick edge of lace that are attached to the garter belt around her hips. A small sliver of skin peaks from in-between her panties and the garter belt, making me salivate.\n “Can you untie the back?” She turns around, making me groan. The cheeks of her perfectly round ass are peeking out from the bottom of her silk panties.\n “Are you trying to kill me?” I choke out.\n “What?” Her head snaps around.\n “You seriously have to know how fucking hot you look right now.” She gets a crazy little smile on her face before arching her back slightly.\n “Can you please untie me?” I step towards her, running my fingers along the edge of her panties on her ass before grabbing one of the ribbons, giving it a gentle tug, and unraveling the bow. When I finally get her completely unlaced, she pulls it around to her front, then places it on the bed, before turning around to face me, her hands holding her breasts. The whole visual is so hot; I actually do know where to start. I pull her forward, my hand wrapping around her hair, bending her head back, giving my mouth access to hers when she gasps. I lick, bite, and suck on her lips, her tongue chasing mine. My mouth travels behind her ear, down her neck to first one breast, pulling her nipple in and sucking hard, then the other, doing the same. Her body arches back. I let go of her hair, drop to my knees, pulling her by the hips so her pussy is right in front of my face, and bite her through her panties, before ripping them to the side and fucking her with my mouth. She grinds down on me, using my head as leverage.\n “So fucking wet, baby. You like it when I fuck your pussy with my mouth. You like me eating you.” I look up at her, her cheeks flushed, lips pink, and eyes dark and hungry. I grab both her ass cheeks, pulling her tighter against me. “Tell me,” I growl.\n “Yes, I love it.” Fuck, I was going to come in my pants just from watching her get off. I pull her tighter against me, sucking her clit into my mouth. She comes on a scream, and when I know she’s back with me, I stand up, kissing her deeply, and start getting undressed with her watching me the whole time. While I pull off my pants, she unclips her garter belt from her stockings and is about to roll them down her thighs, when I stop her.\n “Let me do that.” I walked over, my fingers traveling up her hips and under the garter belt before pulling her panties down, leaving everything else in place. I help her onto the bed, crawl between her legs, lift one, and then the other, and rest her ankles on my shoulders. I slowly rolled down her stockings, taking my time to kiss every inch of skin I expose along the way. “You’re so beautiful.” Feeling her wet heat against the head of my cock, I can’t help but to slide into her in one long stroke, feeling her wetness surrounding me. Her pussy tightens, her head arches back, baring her neck, and when her eyes come back to mine, I slide out, then back in the same way. Every stroke is slow and precise, making sure to hit that spot that I know will have her screaming when it finally builds up. “You’re so tight and wet, baby. I love the way you feel surrounding me.” Her arms and legs wrap around me, holding me tightly.\n I can feel myself beginning to lose it when I feel her pussy practically begging to convulse around me, each stroke pulling us both closer and closer. “Come with me. Shit, come with me.” I put my hand between her legs, pinching her clit and sending her over with me. I rolled over so she was on top of me, both of us breathing deeply. “We just consummated our marriage,” I say on a puff of air. She starts laughing, her head coming up.\n “We did; now it’s official. You’re stuck with me, Mr. Mayson.”\n “Thank fuck.” I pull her head back down, kissing the top. “How about the hot tub now?”\n “Sure, just let me lay here for a few minutes.”\n “You can relax in the hot tub.” I palm her ass, stand up, and carry her outside to the hot tub. And this is how we spend our honeymoon. Sleeping late, breakfast in bed, lazing around the cabin while reading, watching movies, kayaking on the lake, and nights and days making love.\n Chapter 12\n “Liz.” I can hear my name being called, and I know the voice, but don’t know why Kara would be calling my name when I’m on my honeymoon with Trevor.\n “Hmm?” I answer from my groggy state.\n “Liz.” I try to lift my head, but become dizzy from the sharp pain that slices through my head. Then I remember that today is my first day back at work. I was there with Kara when two guys came into the store and forced us at gunpoint out to their van. When I tried to prevent them from taking Kara, something slammed into the back of my head.\n “Kara?” I ask, trying to open my eyes; but they seem too heavy, my body to tired. I try to fight against the feeling that is pulling me back under, knowing I need to make sure Kara’s okay.\n “Liz, you need to wake up.” She shakes me and I’m finally able to open my eyes enough to see her standing over me. “Thank God,” she says, falling to her knees next to me.\n “Are you okay?” I look her over, noticing her clothing intact, and no bruising or scratches are on her.\n “Fine…fine.” She holds her face in her hands. “After they knocked you out, I didn’t try to fight them.” She lifts her face, looking at me. “I’m so sorry. They’re looking for Tim. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t want to, but I told them where he is,” she whispers, tears streaming down her cheeks.\n “It’s okay, calm down.” I lift my hand, holding hers. After a few minutes, I’m finally able to sit up. When I look around, I notice that the only light we have is coming from a small battery operated lantern. When I take in our surroundings, I know exactly where we are; well, not exactly, because there are thousands of tornado shelters all over Tennessee, and this one looks like it’s been abandoned for a long time. The old cement block walls are disintegrating; the shelves that are supposed to hold supplies are rotten, the smell of mold is so strong that my stomach turns. “How long was I out?”\n “I don’t know. A while. When they finally stopped, one of the guys took you out of the van, while the other one questioned me about Tim.” She starts to cry again, this time, holding her very large stomach.\n “Kara, you need to calm down. I know you’re upset, but if you go into labor right now, this whole situation is going to go from bad to worse.”\n “How can I be calm? I just handed over my fiancé to men who want to kill him.” She cries harder.\n “Kara, I know that you’re scared for Tim; but right now, you need to think about you and the baby.” I rub her arm, trying to calm her down. “Tim is working with Trevor and his brothers. He is in a better situation than us right now.” I remind her of where Tim is at this moment, hoping that it will help to calm her down enough to help me get us out of this hellhole. After a few minutes, her crying stops, and she uncovers her face. “We need to try and get out of here.” I tell her, trying to stand. My legs wobble, and I stumble sideways into the wall.\n “You’re bleeding.”\n “What?” I ask, leaning against the wall. The back of my head pounds with every beat of my heart. I lift my hand to the back of my head; that’s when I feel the large wound and the wetness from my blood against my fingers. When I bring my hand near my face, it’s covered with blood. “Shit,” I breathe, closing my eyes.\n “I’m going to be sick.” Kara goes to the corner, throwing up and making my already-queasy stomach lurch. I swallow against the feeling. We both don’t need to be sick at the same time; one of us needs to have it together. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-trevor-until-2/page-31.html","bookId":2745,"book":{"id":2745,"title":"Until Trevor (Until #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Until Trevor (Until #2) \n Trevor Mayson had his life planned out - make the family business successful and play the field for a few more years before eventually settling down.
