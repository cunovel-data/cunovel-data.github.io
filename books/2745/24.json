He wants that for his son.” I don’t tell her that Cash took me aside and told me that Jules told him that if he didn’t do what she wanted that she would get an abortion.\\n\\n “His son?”\\n\\n “Yeah, they’re having a boy.”\\n\\n “I feel so horrible for him.”\\n\\n “Me too; but who knows? He and Jules could end up happy,” I tell her, hoping I’m right.\\n\\n She shakes her head, looking out the window. “Yeah, I guess you’re right.”\\n\\n “Asher is talking to November, and I wanted to talk to you about—”\\n\\n “You don’t even have to say it. I know that Cash is a good guy; and regardless of how I feel about Jules, I will be nice to her.”\\n\\n “Thank you.” I walk over, kissing her forehead. “Is your brother still bringing Kara tomorrow?” I ask.\\n\\n After we got back from Jamaica, Tim called saying that the cops he was working with agreed that the best thing to do is have Kara stay somewhere else while they put the finishing touches on the case against the people Tim was spying on. Tim talked to Mike and explained the situation, and that when it was all said and done, he would come work for me and my brothers to earn the money to pay back what Mike had given to Liz. Tim said that Mike also told him that they could stay in the downstairs apartment, where November and Liz used to live, until they were able to start out on their own. It was a win-win for everyone involved. Tim would pay back the money to Mike. I got a new worker. Liz had someone to help her out in the store, and Kara would have people around to help her out, before and after the baby arrived.\\n\\n “Yeah, Tim said that he can only stay the night, and then has to go back.”\\n\\n “Well, tomorrow when I\u0027m helping get Jules moved, you can go over and get Kara settled in; then tomorrow night, we can all go out to dinner. How does that sound?”\\n\\n “Awesome,” she smiles, and then looked over my face. “You look exhausted. Why don’t you try to sleep for a while?”\\n\\n “Why don’t you take a nap with me?”\\n\\n “You and I both know that if I get in that bed with you, you’re going to try and have your wicked way with me and not get any sleep.”\\n\\n “Hmmm…or you could try to put me to sleep.”\\n\\n “By what, suffocating you with a pillow?” she asks with a mock-glare.\\n\\n “I thought I mellowed you out with the three orgasms I gave you.”\\n\\n Her cheeks turn pink, making her look adorable. “How can my girl be so dirty, then act so shy when I say the word orgasms?”\\n\\n “I\u0027m not dirty,” she says, offended.\\n\\n “Oh, baby, you’re so dirty that I think we need to take another shower.” I say the words close to her ear; I feel her shiver, her hands going to my shoulders, and her nails biting into my skin.\\n\\n “You’re insatiable.”\\n\\n “Only for you.”\\n\\n “You’re really good with that mouth of yours, Mr. Mayson.”\\n\\n “I know,” I tell her smugly, putting her up on the counter.\\n\\n “Ugh…I don’t mean like that; I mean with words.”\\n\\n “Sure you do.” I spread her legs, pulling her ass to the edge. The tank top and panties she’s wearing give me easy access.\\n\\n “I have stuff to do today,” she says. At the same time, she leans her head to the side, giving my mouth more access to her neck.\\n\\n “I’ll be quick,” I tell her, knowing that I\u0027m not letting her go anywhere. And I don’t. We spend the rest of the day in bed, in the kitchen, and in the shower; and in each place, I’m inside of Liz.\\n\\n “So, that’s it,” I say, setting the last box down in the living room.\\n\\n “Yep,” Cash says, looking over at Jules who is in the kitchen.\\n\\n “You sure about this?” I ask, watching Cash’s jaw tick as he watches Jules switch out his stuff for hers.\\n\\n “No,” he says, walking into the kitchen and opening the fridge to grab a beer. Jules says something, making his jaw go tight; then he nods, walking back out into the living room. “Look, thanks for your help today, but I think you guys should go,” Cash says, looking at Nico, Asher, and me. “Jules is tired, and I’m fucking exhausted.”\\n\\n “Yeah, sure, send me a text,” Nico says, patting Cash’s back before he walks out. Asher hugs him, saying something that I can’t hear, before turning and walking off.\\n\\n “If you need anything, call,” I tell him, patting his shoulder. He lifts his chin, walking me to the door.\\n\\n “I’ll see you at the site tomorrow,” he says, as the door closes behind me. I can’t help but to feel like I just left my brother in his own personal hell.\\n\\n When I get out to my truck, Nico and Asher are standing near the tailgate talking. “What’s up?” I look between them.\\n\\n “She’s taking over kind of quickly,” Nico says.\\n\\n “Noticed that, did you?” Asher asks, rubbing the back of his neck. “I don’t know about you guys but I hope to god this isn’t some fucked up game and that this kid is his.”\\n\\n “We all know Cash wears his heart on his sleeve; he always has,” Nico says, shaking his head.\\n\\n “That’s what worries me,” Asher grumbles under his breath.\\n\\n “You did the same thing,” I remind him. Wanting to change the subject no one but me knows what Jules told him and it’s not my place to spread that shit. Cash is already stressed out about this if everyone knew what she was telling him. I shake my head at my own thoughts.\\n\\n “I did, and that shit turned out to be a lie. I don’t want to see Cash go through that,” Asher says. I know he knows how Cash feels. His ex-claimed to be pregnant so that he would marry her, then it turned out she was never even pregnant at all; she made the whole story up so that he would commit to her.\\n\\n “No matter how we feel about it, he needs our support,” I tell them, before looking at the time on my phone. “I need to head out. Liz’s brother is in town for the night dropping off his fiancée.”\\n\\n “So when is he going to be here permanently?” Nico asks.\\n\\n “Not sure,” I shrug, pulling my keys out of my pocket.\\n\\n “Tomorrow, I won’t be at the site. I have a job with Kenton,” Nico says, looking between Asher and me. “I know that you guys don’t want to hear it, but we need to come up with a figure so you can buy me out.”\\n\\n “You’re sure that’s what you want?” Asher asks.\\n\\n “I told you guys before, construction is all I’ve ever known; but tracking people is something I\u0027m good at. I love doing it.”\\n\\n “It’s not safe.” I say, shaking my head.\\n\\n “Neither is working on a jobsite; anything can happen when we’re building a house.”\\n\\n “True. “Asher nods, shoving his hands in the pockets of his jeans. “If it’s what you want to do, find out how much your percentage of the business is worth. We’ll all get together, go over the numbers, and figure out how to make it happen.”\\n\\n “I’ll let you know,” Nico says, walking towards his car. I watch him go, worried about both of my little brothers for different reasons. My phone beeps with a message. I look down reading it.\\n\\n LIZ: I\u0027m starving. Come feed me.\\n\\n ME: Be there soon.\\n\\n I type back the quick response, not even realizing that I have been smiling.\\n\\n “What’s that smile for?” I look up at Asher and glare.\\n\\n “That’s the, I\u0027m-pussy-whipped smile,” Nico yells out his car window, before pulling out of the driveway.\\n\\n Asher laughs, and I flip Nico off. “Gotta go,” I say, opening up my truck door.\\n\\n “See you tomorrow,” Asher says, climbing into his Jeep. I give him a flick of my fingers, before starting up my truck and heading home.\\n\\n “So how did today go?” I ask Liz, who is sprawled out on top of me. When we got home from dinner with Tim and Kara, I couldn’t get her naked and in bed fast enough. Once we finished, she climbed off me, went to the bathroom to clean up, then came back to bed with a rag, wiping me off before crawling on top of me. This is where we have been for the last two hours. When I left Cash’s house, I went straight to Mike’s house, and picked up Liz, while Tim and Kara followed behind in their car to the only Mexican place in town. We ended up staying there for a few hours, talking about everything from Tim’s talk with the detective and Kara’s pregnancy, to our engagement.\\n\\n “It was good. It will be nice having Kara around. I\u0027m excited to get to know her better, and have my nephew close when he comes; plus, it will be nice having someone to help out in the shop since mom is planning on spending more time in Alabama with George.”\\n\\n “Yeah, and having her around will give you some time to start planning our wedding.”\\n\\n “Do you want a big wedding?” she asks, setting her chin on the top of her hands.\\n\\n “I don’t care if it’s big or small, as long as when it’s over, you have my last name.” She smiles, lifting a finger and watching as it travels over my lips.\\n\\n “I still can’t believe that we’re getting married,” she says softly, still looking at her finger on my mouth.\\n\\n “Why?”\\n\\n “It’s just all happening so fast,” she shrugs, her eyes meeting mine.\\n\\n “Not fast enough, if you ask me,” I grumble.\\n\\n She laughs, rolling off me to her back, covering her face with her hands. “Who knew that Trevor Earl Mayson would complain about not being tied down fast enough?”\\n\\n “Tied down? I like the sound of that.” I roll on top of her, pinning her hands next to her head.\\n\\n “You’re not tying me down,” she says, her chest rising and falling quickly.\\n\\n “Why not? Don’t you trust me?”\\n\\n “Yes.”\\n\\n “Let’s see how much you trust me.” I pull her hands up above her head, stretching her out underneath me. “Keep your hands up here.” I sit up, straddling her, running my hands down over the smooth skin of her arms. I trail my fingers lower down, grazing the sides of her breasts, along her ribs. Then I use my hands to move back up her waist, cupping her breasts, trapping her nipples between my middle and pointer fingers. I pull up, her body arching off the bed. “Don’t move your hands.” I tell her, when she goes to lift them off the bed.\\n\\n “I thought you were going to tie me down?” she moans. I smile, biting the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing.\\n\\n “We’re working on trust. I trust you to keep your hands above your head.”\\n\\n “Oh.” She lets out a disappointed breath, making me smile and her eyes narrow. My fiancée doesn’t like to admit it, but she is definitely a dirty girl.\\n\\n “Keep your hands where they are.” I lean over the side of the bed, grabbing the first thing I find, which happens to be her lace panties.\\n\\n “What are you doing with those?”\\n\\n “You’ll see,” I say, pulling her up a little higher on the bed so her hands reach the headboard. I cross her wrists over one another, and then use the lacy panties. I wind them around her wrists, and then the slat in the headboard. “Now, where was I?” I look her over, before lifting both her legs with my hands and sit her ass against my thighs, wrapping her legs around my hips. “Now, let’s start over.” I run my palms from her stomach to her breasts, palming both, before tugging on her nipples. I watch as she arches her back, her pussy rubbing against my cock, her breasts rising and falling rapidly. I let go of her nipples, holding onto her at her ribcage. I keep one there, moving the other hand past her lower belly, then using my thumb to slide over her clit, her hips circle, rubbing against my cock again. “Hold on to the headboard, baby,” I tell her, before I pull her feet from around my waist, setting them onto the bed next to my hips. I lift her slightly, flexing my hips, and slide deep inside her. Her body is completely in the air, almost like she’s doing a back bend, making it easy for me to pound into her with a slight raise of my hips. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-trevor-until-2/page-24.html","bookId":2745,"book":{"id":2745,"title":"Until Trevor (Until #2)","description":"Storyline: Until Trevor (Until #2) \\n Trevor Mayson had his life planned out - make the family business successful and play the field for a few more years before eventually settling down.
