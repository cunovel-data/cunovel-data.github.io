When I first did some research on why you might be late, it said it could be stress, so I wanted to give it some time to see if your period came. It hasn’t, so you need to pee on this.” He holds the test up again.\n “Oh my God,” I whisper, feeling a mixture of nerves and excitement. “Baby, you know you’re kinda crazy, right? I’ve never heard of a man keeping track of his wife’s period and doing research on it.” I smile and stroke my fingers along his strong jaw.\n He shrugs. “So?” he says, climbing on top of me, pinning me down to the bed. “You need to get out of bed, wife, and pee on the stick.”\n “Okay,” I smile. His eyes light up as he helps me out of the bed.\n “What are you doing?” he asks when I go to shut the door to the bathroom.\n “I will be right back.”\n “I’m going to stay with you.” His face is so serious that I start to laugh.\n “All I do is pee on it. After that, I will open the door, and you can come in and wait with me while it processes.”\n “Fine,” he grumbles, as I close the door with a giant smile on my face. I didn’t even think that we would be doing this so quickly, but with lots of therapy and support from everyone around me, I stopped taking my birth control about three months ago. The day I handed Trevor my pill case was a happy day for both of us. I look down at the test in my hand, and go about taking the test. When I’m finished, I open the door for Trevor, who hasn’t moved from right outside it. He comes in, wrapping his arms around my waist. As we wait for the results of whether or not our lives were going to completely change, I hear a ringing and I look at Trevor, who pulls out his phone, turning off the timer. “It said three minutes.” He shrugs.\n Trevor\n I put my phone back in the pocket of my sweats, and turn Liz around to face me. “No matter what that test says we are in this together,” she nods, and I pull her bottom lip out of her teeth. I give her a kiss before grabbing the test off the counter behind her. I hold it between us, and we both look down at the test at the same time. The words PREGNANT is clearly stated through the small window of the test. Her hand goes to her stomach. “We’re pregnant,” I say, stunned. I mean, I was pretty sure, but you never know. She starts to laugh, making me look up. “What?”\n “You said ‘we’re pregnant’.”\n “We are pregnant,” I tell her seriously. “I may not get sick or feel the pain from childbirth, but I will be with you the whole way, taking care of you and making sure that you and our child have everything that you could possibly need.” She does a face-plant into my chest, her arms wrapping around my waist. “How are you feeling about this?” I whisper. A few months ago, when she handed me her case of birth control pills, telling me that she was ready for us to start trying to get pregnant, I was worried that she was rushing it because she thought that it was something that I wanted. Later that night, when I was holding her, I expressed my concerns with her. She explained that with counseling and surviving what she and Kara had gone through, she realized how short life really is, and that you can’t let your fears rule you. So I got out of bed, tossed the pills in the trash, and went about making love to my wife.\n “We’re having a baby.”\n “We are.” I kiss her forehead. “I love you, baby.\n “I love you most,” she whispers, making me smile.\n “Let’s get you and my kid something to eat. Then we need to call and see about setting up a doctor’s appointment.”\n “Oh, no. Are you going to start freaking out like Asher?”\n “If you mean being concerned about you and my child, then yes.”\n “Please don’t buy a baby book.”\n “I won’t.”\n “Oh, good,” she sighs, shaking her head.\n “I think I have it memorized from when Asher or Cash had left them hanging around.”\n She smiles then her smile slips away. “How is Cash going to take this?” she asks, looking at her fingers that are playing with the hem of my shirt.\n “He will be happy for us.” All my brothers will be.\n “I\u0027m happy he’s getting a divorce.” Liz whispers.\n “Me to baby.”\n “I hate her.”\n “I know you do. I don’t like her much myself, but now that he has custody of Jax things should get better for him.”\n “I know. Trevor, she was so mean to him. The things she said and did...” She shakes her head, tears start to fill her beautiful eyes.\n “Hush, baby. It’s okay.” I pull her against me again, holding her close. “Let’s stop talking about Cash and Jules.” I’m fucking happy that Cash finally realized that he couldn’t continue to live a lie with Jules. I hate what he went through but I\u0027m glad it’s over. The bitch even tried to claim that my nephew wasn’t Cash’s at one point so Cash had a paternity test done confirming what he already knew. Now they’re getting divorced and Cash is getting full custody not that Jules really wanted custody to begin with she just wanted to fuck with Cash. I lead Liz out of the bathroom and into the kitchen. She starts to make coffee. I stand there, trying to figure out how to tell her that she can’t drink coffee anymore.\n “What do you want for breakfast?” she asks, looking over her shoulder. She looks beautiful in nothing but one of my shirts and a pair of large socks that slouch around her ankles. Her hair is a mess, and the way the sun is shining through the window makes her look like she’s glowing; or maybe she is glowing. I can’t wait until her waist expands, showing off her pregnancy. I never thought that I could love her any more than I already did. Now, knowing she’s carrying my child has elevated every feeling that I have ever had for her.\n “Whatever you want, baby,” I tell her, when I see her raise her eyebrows.\n “How about French toast?”\n “That sounds good,” I say, watching her fill up the coffee pot with water, worried about what I have to do next.\n “Baby, you don’t need to make coffee. I’m not going to drink any this morning.”\n “Its fine,” she shrugs. “I’m going to drink it.”\n “You can’t.” I cringe, me—fucking Trevor Mayson—cringing when giving my slip of a wife the news, afraid of her reaction.\n “What do you mean ‘I can’t’?”\n “Well, you’re not supposed to drink coffee during a pregnancy.”\n “You’re kidding, right?”\n “Nope, you can have decaf though. Just, right now, we don’t have any.”\n “Oh, okay.” She turns off the water, going to the fridge, leaving me kind of stunned.\n “Are you alright?”\n “Fine, just hungry. Can you get my cell phone for me so I can call the doctor and see about setting up an appointment?”\n “Absolutely.” I smile, thinking that Asher is full of shit. Liz didn’t seem to care at all about not having coffee.\n Three months later.\n Liz\n “Will you please calm down? You’re making me nervous.”\n “I can’t sit down. We’re finding out what we’re having. What if we’re having a girl?”\n “Trevor, you know that it’s a fifty/fifty chance.”\n “I know, but I don’t know if I could handle having a girl. Look at Asher. He has all girls, and November is pregnant with another one.”\n “It will be okay.”\n “I don’t feel so well,” he grumbles, sitting down next to me. I want to laugh, but I know that he is really afraid about this. I mean, when Asher and November found out that they would be having yet another girl, Asher freaked out. November said that the doctor had to give him something to help calm him.\n “Mr. and Mrs. Mayson, if you could come with me,” the elderly nurse says, leading us to a room at the end of the hall. “You’re going to need to change into this.” She hands me a paper robe, and instructs me that once I have it on, I should get up on the bed. Once the door is closed, I start to get undressed. Trevor is frowning the whole time.\n “What now?” I ask, exasperated.\n “Your doctor is a man.”\n “Yeah, you know this. You have met him before.”\n “You never had to get completely naked before.”\n “He has to check me this time.”\n “I don’t like it.”\n “I don’t like it either, and I’m the one who is going to have someone looking at me down there. So can you please just relax? You’re making this harder on me.”\n “Sorry, baby. I just really don’t like people seeing you.”\n “You do know that when I go into labor, there will be a lot of people in the room.”\n “Baby,” he groans, leaning his head back. “You’re not making this any better.” I’m laughing when my doctor walks in.\n “How are you feeling today, Liz?”\n “I’m doing really well.” I lean my head to the side, look at Trevor, and smile.\n “Good to hear. Today, we’re going to be giving you an ultrasound to make sure that everything looks like it should; we can also find out the sex of the baby if you’re interested.”\n “Yes, we would like to know what we’re having.”\n “Good. Well let me just get everything set up, and we will get started.” I nod and hold on to Trevor’s hand. Once Dr. Spark has everything in order, he has me lay back on the bed, and place my feet in the stirrups. “I need you to relax for me,” he says. I do my best and feel a slight pressure down below. Then he stands, putting the samples that he took on the counter, and allows me to lay my legs out straight as he starts spreading a large glob of gel on my small bump. He runs the small device over my stomach, and after a few seconds, the fast swoosh of our baby’s heartbeat fills the room. Trevor holds my hand a little tighter, leaning closer to me so he has a clearer picture of the monitor.\n “How does everything look?” Trevor asks, not taking his eyes away from the monitor.\n “Well, let me take a few measurements,” Dr. Spark says, clicking around on the screen. “From the measurements and the blood that I had taken the other day, everything looks good.” He does some more clicking with the mouse and presses around on my belly, before he goes back to looking at the screen. “Alright. Well, let’s see if the little guy or girl will cooperate.” He keeps running the device all over my belly, then finally he stops. “Well, it seems to me that she is going to be stubborn,” he says. It takes me a second to realize what he just said. I look over at Trevor, who is staring at the doctor. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/until-trevor-until-2/page-34.html","bookId":2745,"book":{"id":2745,"title":"Until Trevor (Until #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Until Trevor (Until #2) \n Trevor Mayson had his life planned out - make the family business successful and play the field for a few more years before eventually settling down.
