{"id":87301,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"“They are,” he said. “They have to be. Koslov probably just has a spell up to dampen sound.” Costa kicked down the first door and I kicked at the next, wishing I’d had the presence of mind to grab my crowbar from the floor where Leon had tossed it. These doors stood between Elaine and me—maybe the very one I was trying desperately to break. I had to get it down. The cries no longer sounded from down the hall, and I wasn’t sure if I hoped that was because Koslov was no longer suffering or because of a sound dampening spell that draped the entire section of the hall we walked in, keeping the sounds within a certain distance of their origin. The door I worked on finally gave, and I almost fell into the room, my knee screaming in protest as my foot hit the ground. Light from the hallway poured into the room, and I stared dumbly at Elaine. Dark circles surrounded her eyes and she looked thinner than she had a week before, but she stared at me— wide-eyed and tied to a chair. Alive. I called something to Costa, and after a few second he appeared with a pocketknife to cut Elaine free. She flung herself into my arms. Adrenaline rushed through my body, and I squeezed her tight. Costa was there, pulling me again. Elaine clung to me as we moved, and I saw Natalie, looking slightly rumpled but otherwise unharmed, next to Costa. She rubbed her wrists where she’d no doubt been restrained as well. I followed them down what felt like a never-ending hallway, half carrying Elaine with me. Then there was light. Fresh air filled my aching lungs. And sirens wailed loudly. I held Elaine and Costa held us both until a paramedic took her from my arms. I followed them, but then Elaine was surrounded, and I was forced to hover around the edge of the bodies questioning her. Then Astrid was there, giving me water and asking questions that I couldn’t seem to pull my mind together well enough to answer. A paramedic asked me something, but talking hurt my smoke-burned throat, and all I could stutter out was a question about Elaine. “What the fuck were you thinking?” Vasquez asked, and I blinked at him. I hadn’t even seen him approach. “I’m sorry,” I said, my voice low and raspy. The water I’d forced down had helped—but it wasn’t a miracle cure. He grimaced at my voice. “We’ll talk about this tomorrow. Don’t think you’re free and clear on this stunt.” I nodded, and immediately regretted the motion. I wasn’t sure if the smoke inhalation or the use of my very rusty conscious succubus powers was responsible, but something had given me a heck of a headache. But I was alive, and I’d see as many doctors as they wanted to throw at me after I got Elaine set up in the hospital. Vasquez stomped off, and I saw him corner Costa near the ambulance. They were moving Elaine inside the vehicle, so I pushed up from the police car I’d been sitting on and headed for my sister. Someone tall blocked my path, and it took me a few beats to wrap my mind around the red hair, the pursed lips, and the striking features. “I don’t have time to talk to you, Agent,” I rasped, putting as much bitchiness into my voice as I could. Beatrice raised an eyebrow at that. “You have your sister now. I’d say you have nothing but time.” My gaze flew back to Elaine. Yes. They were definitely loading her up to go to the hospital. I needed to get into that ambulance. She spared a quick glance over her shoulder, and when she looked back at me her expression had softened. “Look, I just wanted to tell you that I was sorry. I acted like a real bitch at the hotel. You didn’t deserve that, and neither did Val. I get…protective of him sometimes.” A smile touched her face, taking her from merely gorgeous to breathtaking. “Okay, scratch that. I get downright jealous.” I couldn’t deal with this right now. I couldn’t think about Costa or his ridiculously attractive partner. “I need to get on that ambulance,” I said simply, and then shouldered past her. I waved at the paramedic who held the door and he paused, understanding. I threw a quick glance over my shoulder before jumping into the ambulance. But Costa was no longer talking to Vasquez—the OWEA agent was gone. Chapter Fifteen I stared at my teacup and tried to make plans for the day. Nearly a week had passed since Costa and I had saved Elaine and Natalie from the warehouse fire. The questions started only minutes after we’d escaped from the building. Questions from the paramedics about Elaine. Questions from Lieutenant Vasquez about Koslov. Questions from OWEA agents about Costa. So many damn questions, and all I wanted was to go home. But I’d heard nothing from Costa. I knew that he had to be up to his ears with his own questions and reports and who knew what else, but I didn’t have to be happy about it. Luckily my burns were easily treated on an outpatient basis. I just had to be careful with the bandages for the first few days. And Koslov’s spell had been short-lived. My lungs and throat were raw, but as long as I kept my voice down, it didn’t bother me too much. Movement in the entryway between the hall and kitchen drew my attention. Elaine, arms crossed with a frown creasing her face, leaned against the doorframe. “Any word?” she said simply. I shook my head. I’d told her what happened during her kidnapping—most of it, anyway. “You should call him.” Her voice was firm. Strong. Like she hadn’t just been held against her will for several days. Of course, she couldn’t hide the full impacts from me. I’d heard her screaming in her sleep. I’d woken her from the nightmares. “You should be resting.” “I’m tired of resting. Why don’t you just call him?” “Because there’s no point.” I took a sip of my tea and turned my eyes back to the table. “Mari, look at me.” I took a deep breath and met her eyes, the same clear blue I saw in the mirror every morning. “I’m here for you,” I said firmly. “I don’t have time or energy to worry about Costa. You are my priority.” Tears welled in her eyes, and I’d crossed the room to pull her into my arms before I realized I’d moved. She squirmed and pushed me away, stepping back so she could capture my gaze again. “Stop this. You can’t keep me any safer than you already do. And I refuse to live my life in fear again. I lost years of my life that way. Years, Mari. And I cost you years of your life, too.” I shook my head furiously, but she didn’t stop talking. “You deserve this, big sister. You deserve a chance to be happy. You deserve a man who will make you happy. And if there’s one thing I learned from all of this, it’s that life can end at any time. We both need to live to the fullest while we can.” I opened my mouth to argue, but the doorbell rang, startling me, and I sloshed some of my tea onto the table. A smile flashed on Elaine’s face. “I’ll be upstairs,” she said, and then she turned and hurried away. “Did you call him?” I hissed after her. But she just waved over her shoulder at me and disappeared up the stairs. I took a deep breath and opened the door. Costa’s expression was serious, and I had to restrain myself from jumping into his arms the moment I saw him. “I’m sorry I didn’t call,” he said, stepping into the house. I looked away from him, suddenly fighting a lump in my throat. “It’s fine,” I finally managed. “No, it’s not, but I wasn’t able to call anyone. The fire… They suspected me, at first until they questioned all the witnesses. And then enough time passed that it seemed like it would be better for me to just come here, talk to you in person.” He closed the door and stepped closer to me. “And Elaine called you,” I muttered, feeling somehow betrayed. I’d known Costa had been implicated but hadn’t realized they’d given him such a hard time. After all, they’d interviewed me and I’d told them about Leon. But considering what had happened, I wasn’t surprised by their extra thoroughness. “There was that, yes.” His expression was something I’d never seen on him. Unsure and hesitant. A little sad. Suddenly I wanted nothing more than to wipe that sadness from his face. But I couldn’t. Not yet. “Explain to me what the hell happened in your hotel room.” Flashes of Bea’s face hit me, and the humiliation I’d felt that morning came back in a rush. I stepped back, needing room between us. “Bea questioned why I’d be working with you on this. I told her it was because I wanted to keep you close in case the kidnapper went for you.” He grimaced and shoved his hands in his pockets. “That was bullshit, of course. It wouldn’t have made any sense for the bastard to come after you, a cop. There were plenty of easier succubi around who would have made more sense.” “But she believed you?” “She knew I was full of shit.” He snorted. “But she wasn’t in town, so there wasn’t much she could do until…” I nodded. “Were—are you involved with her or something?” “No!” he said, and he stepped forward and grasped my shoulders. Startled, I looked up and met his eyes. He dropped his hands to his sides, and stepped back. “I’m sorry. No. We’re close. We’ve been partners for years, and we’ve been through some shit together. But it’s not like that. Not for me, at least. She’s like a sister to me. She’s just protective.” I believed him. I wasn’t sure if it was Beatrice’s apology after the fire, or the desperation in his eyes that did it, but I knew he was telling the truth. “I should have come after you. Explained. I’m sorry. I haven’t exactly been trusting since everything that happened with my brother, and honestly I was scared that you’d just tell me to go to hell.” I sighed. “I should have let you explain. Running out like that…it wasn’t exactly the mature thing to do.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-lost-files-of-the-otherworlder-enforcement-agency-2/page-23.html","bookId":2263,"book":{"id":2263,"title":"Succubus Lost (Files of the Otherworlder Enforcement Agency #2)","description":"Storyline: Succubus Lost (Files of the Otherworlder Enforcement Agency #2) Someone is kidnapping and incinerating otherworlders beyond recognition, and detective Marisol Whitman, a succubus, races to find the murderer before he claims another victim.
