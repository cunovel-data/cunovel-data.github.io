{"id":23763,"no":19,"title":"19. When the Kissing Stopped","content":"Bond leaned on one elbow and looked down at the beautiful drowned face. There was a dew of sweat below the eyes and at the temples. A pulse beat fast at the base of the neck. The lines of authority had been sponged away by the love-making and the face had a soft, sweet, bruised look. The wet eyelashes parted and the tawny eyes, big and faraway, looked up with remote curiosity into Bond\u0027s. They focused lazily and examined him as if they were seeing him for the first time. Bond said, ?I\u0027m sorry. I shouldn\u0027t have done that.? The words amused her. The dimples at each side of the mouth deepened into clefts. She said, ?You talk like a girl who has had it for the first time. Now you are frightened that you will have a baby. You will have to tell your mother.? Bond leaned down and kissed her. He kissed the two corners of her mouth and then the parted lips. He said, ?Come and swim. Then I must talk to you.? He got to his feet and held out his hands. Reluctantly she took them. He pulled her up and against him. Her body flirted with his, knowing it was safe. She smiled impishly up at him and became more wanton. Bond crushed her fiercely to him, to stop her and because he knew they had only a few more minutes of happiness. He said, ?Stop it, Domino. And come on. We don\u0027t need any clothes. The sand won\u0027t hurt your foot. I was only pretending.? She said, ?So was I when I came out of the sea. The spines didn\u0027t hurt all that much. And I could have cured them if I\u0027d wanted to. Like the fishermen do. You know how?? Bond laughed. ?Yes I do. Now, into the sea.? He kissed her once and stood back and looked at her body to remember how it had been. Then he turned abruptly and ran to the sea and dived deeply down. When he got back to shore she was already out and dressing. Bond dried himself. He answered her laughing remarks through the partition with monosyllables. Finally she accepted the change in him. She said, ?What is the matter with you, James? Is anything wrong?? ?Yes, darling.? Pulling on his trousers, Bond heard the rattle of the little gold chain against the coins in his pocket. He said, ?Come outside. I\u0027ve got to talk to you.? Sentimentally, Bond chose a patch of sand on the other side of the nut from where they had been before. She came out and stood in front of him. She examined his face carefully, trying to read it. Bond avoided her eyes. He sat with his arms around his knees and looked out to sea. She sat down beside him, but not close. She said, ?You are going to hurt me. Is it that you too are going away? Be quick. Do it cleanly and I will not cry.? Bond said, ?I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s worse than that, Domino. It\u0027s not about me. It\u0027s about your brother.? Bond sensed the stiffening of her body. She said in a low, tense voice, ?Go on. Tell me.? Bond took the bracelet out of his pocket and silently handed it to her. She took it. She hardly gave it a glance. She turned a little away from Bond. ?So he is dead. What happened to him?? ?It is a bad story, and a very big one. It involves your friend Largo. It is a very great conspiracy. I am here to find out things for my government. I am really a kind of policeman. I am telling you this and I will tell you the rest because hundreds and perhaps thousands of people will die unless you help to prevent it. That is why I had to show you that bracelet and hurt you so that you would believe me. I am breaking my oath in doing this. Whatever happens, whatever you decide to do, I trust you not to tell what I am going to say.? ?So that is why you made love to me-to make me do what you want. And now you blackmail me with the death of my brother.? The words came out between her teeth. Now in a soft, deadly whisper, she said, ?I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.? Bond said coldly, in a matter-of-fact voice, ?Your brother was killed by Largo, or on his orders. I came here to tell you that. But then?-he hesitated-?you were there and I love you and want you. When what happened began to happen I should have had strength to stop it. I hadn\u0027t. I knew it was then or perhaps never. Knowing what I knew, it was a dreadful thing to have done. But you looked so beautiful and happy. I wanted to put off hurting you. That is my only excuse.? Bond paused. ?Now listen to what I have to tell you. Try and forget about your hate for me. In a moment you will realize that we are nothing in all this. This is a thing by itself.? Bond didn\u0027t wait for her to comment. He began from the beginning and went slowly, minutely, through the whole case, omitting only the advent of the Manta , the one factor that could now be of help to Largo and perhaps alter his plans. He ended, ?So you see, there is nothing we can do until those weapons are actually on board the Disco . Until that moment comes, Largo has a perfect alibi with his treasure-hunt story. There is nothing to link him with the crashed plane or with SPECTRE. If we interfere with him now, this moment, arrest the ship on some excuse, put a watch on her, prevent her sailing, there will only be a delay in the SPECTRE plan. Only Largo and his men know where the bombs are hidden. If the plane has gone for them, it will be keeping contact with the Disco by radio. If there\u0027s any hitch, the plane can leave the bombs at the hiding place or at another, dump them in shallow water anywhere, and return for them when the trouble has blown over. Even the Disco could be taken off the job and some other ship or plane used any time in the future. SPECTRE headquarters, wherever they are, will inform the Prime Minister that there has been a change of plan, or they can say nothing at all. Then, perhaps weeks from now, they will send another communication. And this time there will perhaps be only twenty-four hours\u0027 notice for the money to be dropped. The terms will be tougher. And we shall have to accept them. So long as those bombs are still lost to us, the threat is there. You see that?? ?Yes. So what is to be done?? The voice was harsh. The girl\u0027s eyes glittered fiercely as they looked at and through Bond toward some distant target-not, he thought, at Largo the great conspirator, but at Largo who had had her brother killed. ?We have got to know when those bombs are on board the Disco . That is all that matters. Then we can act with all our weight. And we have one great factor on our side. We are pretty sure that Largo feels secure. He still believes that the wonderful plan, and it is wonderful, is going exactly as it was meant to do. That is our strength and our only strength. You see that?? ?And how are you to know when the bombs come on board the yacht?? ?You must tell us.? ?Yes.? The monosyllable was dull, indifferent. ?But how am I to know? And how am I to tell you? This man is no fool. He is only foolish in wanting his mistress?-she spat the word out-?when so much else is at stake.? She paused. ?These people have chosen badly. Largo cannot live without a woman within reach. They should have known that.? ?When did Largo tell you to come back on board?? ?Five. The boat is coming to fetch me at Palmyra.? Bond looked at his watch. ?It is now four. I have this Geiger counter. It is simple to use. It will tell at once if the bombs are on board. I want you to take it with you. If it says there is a bomb on board, I want you to show a light at your porthole-switch the lights on in your cabin several times, anything like that. We have men watching the ship. They will be told to report. Then get rid of the Geiger counter. drop it overboard.? She said scornfully, ?That is a silly plan. It is the sort of melodramatic nonsense people write about in thrillers. In real life people don\u0027t go into their cabins and switch on their lights in daylight. No. If the bombs are there, I will come up on deck-show myself to your men. That is natural behavior. If they are not there, I will stay in my cabin.? ?All right. Have it your own way. But will you do this?? ?Of course. If I can prevent myself killing Largo when I see him. But on condition that when you get him you will see that he is killed.? She was entirely serious. She looked at him with matter-of-fact eyes as if he were a travel agent and she were reserving a seat on a train. ?I doubt if that will happen. I should say that every man on board will get a life sentence in prison.? She considered this. ?Yes. That will do. That is worse than being killed. Now show me how this machine works.? She got to her feet and took a couple of steps up the beach. She seemed to remember something. She looked down at the bracelet in her hand. She turned and walked down to the edge of the sea and stood for a moment looking out across the quiet water. She said some words that Bond couldn\u0027t hear. Then she leaned back and with all her strength threw the gold chain far out over the shoal into the dark blue. The chain twinkled briefly in the strong sun and there was a small splash. She watched the ripples widen and, when the smashed mirror was whole again, turned and walked back up the sand, her small limp leaving footmarks of uneven depth. Bond showed her the working of the machine. He eliminated the wrist-watch indicator and told her to depend entirely on the telltale clicking. ?Anywhere in the ship should be all right,? he explained. ?But better near the hold if you can get there. Say you want to take a photograph from the well deck aft or something. This thing\u0027s made up to look like a Rolleiflex. It\u0027s got all the Rolleiflex lenses and gadgets on the front, lever to press and all. It just hasn\u0027t got a film. You could say that you\u0027d decided to take some farewell pictures of Nassau and the yacht, couldn\u0027t you?? ?Yes.? The girl, who had been listening attentively, now seemed distracted. Tentatively she put out a hand and touched Bond\u0027s arm. She let the hand fall. She looked up at him and then swiftly away. She said shyly, ?What I said, what I said about hating you. That is not true. I didn\u0027t understand. How could I-all this terrible story? I still can\u0027t quite believe it, believe that Largo has anything to do with it. We had a sort of an affair in Capri. He is an attractive man. Everyone else wanted him. It was a challenge to take him from all these other smart women. Then he explained about the yacht and this wonderful trip looking for treasure. It was like a fairy tale. Of course I agreed to come. Who wouldn\u0027t have? In exchange, I was quite ready to do what I had to do.? She looked briefly at him and away. ?I am sorry. But that is how it is. When we got to Nassau and he kept me ashore, away from the yacht, I was surprised but I was not offended. The islands are beautiful. There was enough for me to do. But what you have told me explains many small things. I was never allowed in the radio room. The crew were silent and unfriendly-they treated me like someone who was not wanted on board, and they were on curious terms with Largo, more like equals than paid men. And they were tough men and better educated than sailors usually are. So it all fits. I can even remember that, for a whole week before last Thursday, Largo was terribly nervous and irritable. We were already getting tired of each other. I put it down to that. I was even making plans for flying home by myself. But he has been better the last few days and when he told me to be packed and ready to come on board this evening, I thought I might just as well do as he said. And of course I was very excited over this treasure hunt. I wanted to see what it was all about. But then?-she looked out to sea-?there was you. And this afternoon, after what happened, I had decided to tell Largo I would not go. I would stay here and see where you went and go with you.? For the first time she looked him full in the face and held his eyes. ?Would you have let me do that?? Bond reached out and put his hand against her cheek. ?Of course I would.? ?But what happens now? When shall I see you again?? This was the question Bond had dreaded. By sending her back on board, and with the Geiger counter, he was putting her in double danger. She could be found out by Largo, in which case her death would be immediate. If it came to a chase, which seemed almost certain, the Manta would sink the Disco by gunfire or torpedo, probably without warning. Bond had added up these factors and had closed his mind to them. He kept it closed. He said, ?As soon as this is over. I shall look for you wherever you are. But now you are going to be in danger. You know this. Do you want to go on with it?? She looked at her watch. She said, ?It is half past four. I must go. Do not come with me to the car. Kiss me once and stay here. Do not worry about what you want done. I will do it well. It is either that or a stiletto in the hack for this man.? She held out her arms. ?Come.? Minutes later Bond heard the engine of the MG come to life. He waited until the sound had receded in the distance down the Western Coast Road; then he went to the Land Rover and climbed in and followed. A mile down the coast, at the two white obelisks that marked the entrance to Palmyra, dust still hung in the driveway. Bond sneered at his impulse to drive in after her and stop her from going out to the yacht. What in hell was he thinking of? He drove on fast down the road to Old Fort Point, where the police watchers were housed in the garage of a deserted villa. They were there, one man reading a paperback in a canvas chair while the other sat before tripod binoculars that were trained on the Disco through a gap in the blinds of a side window. The khaki walkie-talkie set was beside them on the floor. Bond gave them the new briefing and got on the radio to the Police Commissioner and confirmed it to him. The Commissioner passed two messages to him from Leiter. One was to the effect that the visit to Palmyra had been negative except that a servant had said the girl\u0027s baggage had gone on board the Disco that afternoon. The boathouse was completely innocent. It contained a glass-bottomed boat and pedallo. The pedallo would have made the tracks they had seen from the air. The second message said that the Manta was expected in twenty minutes. Would Bond meet Leiter at the Prince George, Wharf, where she would dock. *** The Manta , coming with infinite caution up-channel, had none of the greyhound elegance of the conventional submarine. She was blunt and thick and ugly. The bulbous metal cucumber, her rounded nose shrouded with tarpaulin to hide the secrets of her radar scanner from the Nassavians, held no suggestion of her speed, which Leiter said was around forty knots submerged. ?But they won\u0027t tell you that, James. That\u0027s Classified. I guess we\u0027re going to find that even the paper in the can is Classified when we go aboard. Watch out for these Navy guys, Nowadays they\u0027re so tight-lipped they think even a belch is a security risk.? ?What else do you know about her?? ?Well, we won\u0027t tell this to the captain, but of course in C.I.A. we had to be taught the basic things about these atom subs, so we could brief agents on what to look for and recognize clues in their reports. She\u0027s one of the George Washington Class, about four thousand tons, crew of around a hundred, cost about a hundred million dollars. Range, anything you want until the chow runs out or until the nuclear reactor needs topping up-say every hundred thousand miles or so. If she has the same armament as the George Washington, she\u0027ll have sixteen vertical launching tubes, two banks of eight, for the Polaris solid-fuel missile. These have a range of around twelve hundred miles. The crews call the tubes the `Sherwood Forest\u0027 because they\u0027re painted green and the missile compartment looks like rows of great big tree trunks. These Polaris jobs are fired from way down below the surface. The sub stops and holds dead steady. They have the ship\u0027s exact position at all times through radio fixes and star sights through a tricky affair called a star-tracker periscope. All this dope is fed into the missiles automatically. Then the chief gunner presses a button and a missile shoots up through the water by compressed air. When it breaks surface the solid-fuel rockets ignite and take the missile the rest of the way. Hell of a weapon, really, when you come to think of it. Imagine these damned things shooting up out of the sea anywhere in the world and blowing some capital city to smithereens. We\u0027ve got six of them already and we\u0027re going to have more. Good deterrent when you come to think of it. You don\u0027t know where they are or when. Not like bomber bases and firing pads and so on you can track down and put out of action with your first rocket wave.? Bond commented drily, ?They\u0027ll find some way of spotting them. And presumably an atomic depth charge set deep would send a shock wave through hundreds of miles of water and blow anything to pieces over a huge area. But has she got anything smaller than these missiles? If we\u0027re going to do a job on the Disco what are we going to use?? ?She\u0027s got six torpedo tubes up front and I dare say she\u0027s got some smaller stuff-machine guns and so forth. The trouble\u0027s going to be to get the commander to fire them. He\u0027s not going to like firing on an unarmed civilian yacht on the orders of a couple of plainclothes guys, and one of them a Limey at that. Hope his orders from the Navy Department are as solid as mine and yours.? The huge submarine bumped gently against the wharf. Lines were thrown and an aluminum gangplank was run ashore. There was a ragged cheer from the crowd of watchers being held back by a cordon of police. Leiter said, ?Well, here we go. And to one hell of a tad start. Not a hat between us to salute the quarter deck with. You curtsy, I\u0027ll bow.?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1583/47077.html","bookId":1267,"book":{"id":1267,"title":"007之霹雳弹 Thunderball","description":"简介： 魔鬼党是一个世界性的恐怖组织，专门从事毒品、抢劫、勒索等国际性案件。某日，魔鬼党拦截了美国运往英国的两枚原子弹，并向英国首相勒索1亿英镑，否则将于七天内炸毁英国各大城市。英方情急之下，派遣007前往魔鬼党总部，并同杜明娜内应终于拆除核弹引线，阻止了大灾难...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/20/09-21-12-54-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1583","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
