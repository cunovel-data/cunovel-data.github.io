{"id":23766,"no":22,"title":"22. The Shadower","content":"In the attack center of the Manta it was very quiet. Commander Pedersen, standing behind the man at the echo-sounder, occasionally made a comment over his shoulder to Bond and Leiter, who had been given canvas-backed chairs well away from the depth and speed gauges, which had been hooded so that they could be read only by the navigating team. These three men sat side by side on red leather, foam-cushioned, aluminum seats, handling the rudder and the forward and aft diving planes as if they were pilots in an airliner. Now the captain left the echo-sounder and came over to Bond and Leiter. He smiled cheerfully. ?Thirty fathoms and the nearest cay is a mile to westwards. Now we\u0027ve got a clear course all the way to Grand Bahama. And we\u0027re making good speed. If we keep it up, we\u0027ve got about four hours\u0027 sailing. Be off Grand Bahama about an hour before first light. How about some food and a bit of sleep? There won\u0027t be anything on the radar for an hour-these Berry Islands\u002711 fill the screen until we\u0027re clear of them. Then\u002711 come the big question. When we clear them, shall we see that one of the smallest of the cays has broken loose and is sailing fast northwards on a parallel course to ours? If we see that on the screen, it\u0027ll be the Disco. If she\u0027s there, we\u0027ll submerge. You\u0027ll hear the alarm bells. But you can just roll over and have a bit more sleep. Nothing can happen until it\u0027s certain that she\u0027s in the target area. Then we\u0027ll have to think again.? The captain made for the stairway. ?Mind if I lead the way? Watch your head on the pipes. This is the one part of the ship where there isn\u0027t much clearance.? \\n\\n \\n\\n They followed him down and along a passage to the mess hall, a well-lighted dining room finished in cream with pastel pink and green panels. They took their places at the head of one of the Formica-top tables away from the other officers and men, who looked curiously at the two civilians. The captain waved a hand at the walls of the room. ?Bit of a change from the old battleship gray. You\u0027d be surprised how many eggheads are involved in the design of these ships. Have to be, if you want to keep your crew happy when the ship\u0027s submerged for a month or more at a time. The trick-cyclists said We couldn\u0027t have just one color, must have contrast everywhere or the men\u0027s eyes get sort of depressed. This hall\u0027s used for movies, closed-circuit television, cribbage tournaments, bingo, God knows what-anything to keep the men off duty from getting bored. And you notice there\u0027s no smell of cooking or engine smells. Electrostatic precipitators all over the ship that filter them off.? A steward came with menus. ?Now then, let\u0027s get down to it. I\u0027m having the baked Virginia ham with red-eye gravy, apple pie with ice cream, and iced coffee. And steward, don\u0027t go too easy on that red-eye.? He turned to Bond. ?Getting out of harbor always gives me an appetite. You know, it isn\u0027t the sea the captain hates, it\u0027s the land.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond ordered poached eggs with rye toast and coffee. He was grateful for the captain\u0027s cheerful talk, but he himself had no appetite. There was a gnawing tension inside him which would be released only when the Disco was picked up on the radar and there would be a prospect of action. And lurking behind his concern about the whole operation was worry about the girl. Had he been right to trust her with so much of the truth? Had she betrayed him? Had she been caught? Was she alive? He drank down a glass of iced water, and listened to the captain explaining how the ice cubes and the water were distilled from the sea. \\n\\n \\n\\n Finally Bond became impatient with the cheerful, even tone of the conversation. He said, ?Forgive me, Captain, but could I interrupt for a moment and clear my mind about what we\u0027re going to do if we\u0027re right about the Disco and if we come up with her off the Grand Bahama? I can\u0027t quite figure what the next step ought to be. I\u0027ve got my own ideas, but were you thinking we\u0027d try and go alongside and board her, or just blow her out of the water?? \\n\\n \\n\\n The captain\u0027s gray eyes were quizzical. He said, ?I was kind of leaving all that to you fellers. The Navy Department says that I\u0027m under your orders. I\u0027m just the chauffeur. Supposing you tell me what you have in mind and I\u0027ll be glad to go along with anything you suggest so long as it doesn\u0027t endanger my ship?-he smiled-?too much, that is. In the last resort, if the Navy Department means what it says, and from your account of this operation it does, the safety of the ship will also have to go by the board. As I told you aloft in the attack center, I got acknowledgment of our signal and full approval for our proposed course of action. That\u0027s all the clearance I need. Now then, you tell me.? \\n\\n \\n\\n The food came. Bond pecked at his eggs and pushed them away. He lit a cigarette. He said, looking at Felix Leiter, ?Well, I don\u0027t know what you\u0027ve worked out, Felix, but this is how I see the picture we may find around four o\u0027clock in the morning, on the assumption, that is, that the Disco has been sailing north in shoal water under cover of the Berry Islands and that she\u0027ll then make for the Grand Bahama shore somewhere off the site of the missile station. Well now, on that assumption, I\u0027ve had a good look at the charts and it seems to me that, if she\u0027s going to lay that bomb as close to the target as she can, she\u0027ll heave to and anchor about a mile offshore in about ten fathoms and get the bomb another half-mile or so closer to the target, lay it in twelve feet of water or so, switch on the time mechanism, and get the hell away. That\u0027s how I\u0027d go about it. She\u0027d be away by first light and there\u0027s plenty of yacht traffic around West End from what I can gather from the pilot. She\u0027d show up on the station radar, of course, but she\u0027d be just another yacht. Assuming the bomb\u0027s set for the twelve hours Largo\u0027s got before the time limit expires, he could be back in Nassau or twice as far away if he wanted in the time he\u0027s got. For my money, he\u0027ll go back to Nassau with his treasure-hunting story and wait for the next lot of orders from SPECTRE.? Bond paused. He avoided Leiter\u0027s eyes. ?That is, unless he\u0027s managed to get information out of the girl.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Leiter said stanchly, ?Hell, I don\u0027t believe that girl would talk. She\u0027s a tough cookie. And supposing she did? He\u0027s only got to drop her overboard with some lead round her neck and say her aqualung failed on the treasure hunt, or some spiel of that sort. He\u0027d go back to Nassau all right. That man\u0027s cover\u0027s as solid as J. P. Morgan and Company.? \\n\\n \\n\\n The captain interrupted. ?Leaving all that aside, Commander Bond, and sticking to the operational angles, how do you suggest he\u0027s going to get that bomb out of the ship and right into the target area? I agree that according to the charts he can\u0027t get much closer in the yacht, and if he did he might be in trouble with the waterfront guard at the missile station. I see from my dope on the place that they\u0027ve got some kind of a guard boat for chasing away fishermen and suchlike when they\u0027re going to do a practice shoot.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond said decisively, ?I\u0027m sure that\u0027s the real purpose of the underwater compartment in the Disco . They\u0027ve got one of those underwater sleds in there, and probably an electric torpedo to haul it. They\u0027ll load the bomb on the sled and take it in with a team of underwater swimmers, lay it, and come back to the ship. Otherwise, why have all that underwater gear?? \\n\\n \\n\\n The captain said slowly, ?You may be right, Commander. It makes sense. But so what do you want me to do about it?? \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond looked the captain in the eye. ?There\u0027s only one moment to nail these people. If we show our hand too soon, the Disco can get the hell away-only a few hundred yards maybe, and dump the bombs in a hundred fathoms. The only time to get them, and the bomb, the first bomb anyway, is when that team has left the ship and is on its way to the laying point. We\u0027ve got to get their underwater team with our underwater team. The second bomb, if it\u0027s aboard, doesn\u0027t matter. We can sink the ship with the second bomb inside her.? \\n\\n \\n\\n The captain looked down at his plate. He arranged the knife and fork tidily together, straightened the dessert spoon, and took the remains of his iced coffee and swirled the fragments of ice round so that they tinkled. He put the glass back on the table and looked up, first at Leiter then at Bond. He said thoughtfully, ?I guess what you say makes sense, Commander. We have plenty of oxygen re-breathers on board. We also have ten of the finest swimmers in the nuclear flotilla. But they\u0027ll only have knives to fight with. I\u0027ll have to ask for volunteers.? He paused. ?Who\u0027s going to lead them?? Bond said, ?I\u0027ll do that. Skin-diving happens to be one of my hobbies. And I know what fish to look out for and which ones not to mind about. I\u0027ll brief your men about those things.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Felix Leiter interrupted. He said obstinately, ?And don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to leave me behind eating Virginia ham. I put an extra foot-flipper on this?-he held up the shining hook-?and I\u0027ll race you over half a mile any day, gammy leg and all. You\u0027d be surprised the things one gets around to improvise when someone chews off one of your arms. Compensation it\u0027s called by the medics, in case you hadn\u0027t heard about it.? \\n\\n \\n\\n The captain smiled. He got to his feet. ?Okay, okay. I\u0027ll leave you two heroes to fight it out while I have a word to the men over the speaker system. Then we\u0027ll have to get together with the charts and see that the gear\u0027s okay and suchlike. You fellers aren\u0027t going to get any sleep after all. I\u0027ll have a ration of battle pills issued to you. You\u0027re going to need them.? He raised a hand and went off down the mess hall. \\n\\n \\n\\n Leiter turned to Bond. ?You goddam shyster. Thought you were going to leave your old pal behind, didn\u0027t you? God, the treachery of you Limeys! Perfidious Albion is right, all right.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond laughed. ?How the hell was I to know you\u0027d been in the hands of rehabilitators and therapists and so on? I never knew you took life so seriously. I suppose you\u0027ve even found some way of petting with that damned meathook of yours.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Leiter said darkly, ?You\u0027d be surprised. Get a girl round the arm with this and you\u0027d be amazed the effect it has on their good resolutions. Now then, let\u0027s get down to cases. What sort of formation are we going to swim in? Can we get some of those knives made into lances? How are we going to recognize our side from theirs underwater, and in semi-darkness at that? We\u0027ve got to make this operation pretty solid. That Pedersen\u0027s a good guy. We don\u0027t want to get some of his men killed through some damn silly mistake of ours.? \\n\\n \\n\\n The voice of the captain sounded over the communication system. ?Now hear this. This is your Captain speaking. It is possible that we may encounter hazards in the course of this operation. I will tell you how this may come about. This ship has been chosen by the Navy Department for an exercise that is tantamount to an operation of war. I will tell you the story, which will remain classified top secret until further orders. This is what has happened . . .? \\n\\n \\n\\n *** \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond, asleep in one of the duty officers\u0027 bunks, was awakened by the alarm bell. The iron voice of the P.A. system said: ?Diving stations. Diving stations,? and almost at once his bunk tilted slightly and the distant whine of the engines altered pitch. Bond smiled grimly to himself. He slipped off the bunk and went along and up to the attack center. Felix Leiter was already there. The captain turned away from the plot. His face was tense. He said, ?It looks as if you were right, gentlemen. We\u0027ve got her, all right. About five miles ahead and two points to starboard. She\u0027s doing around thirty knots. No other ship could be holding that speed, or would be likely to. And she\u0027s showing no lights. Here, care to have a look through the scope? She\u0027s raising quite a wake and kicking up plenty of phosphorescence. No moon yet, but you\u0027ll see the white blur when your eyes get used to the dark.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond bent to the rubber eye sockets. In a minute he had her, a white scut on the horizon of the soft, feathery swell. He stood back. ?What\u0027s her course?? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?Same as ours-western end of Grand Bahama. We\u0027ll go deeper now and put on a bit of speed. We\u0027ve got her on the Sonar as well, so we shan\u0027t lose her. We\u0027ll get up parallel and close in a bit later. The met. report gives a light westerly breeze in the early hours. That\u0027d be a help. Don\u0027t want it too calm when we unload the swimming party. The surface\u0027ll boil quite a bit as each man goes out. Here.? He turned to a powerful-looking man in white ducks. ?This is Petty Officer Fallon. He\u0027s in command of the swimming party, under your and Mr. Leiter\u0027s orders, of course. All the top swimmers volunteered. He\u0027s chosen nine of them. I\u0027ve taken them off all duties. Maybe you gentlemen would like to get acquainted with your team. You\u0027ll want to discuss your routines. I guess discipline\u0027ll have to be pretty tight-recognition signals and so forth. Okay? The sergeant at arms is looking after the weapons.? He smiled. ?He\u0027s rustled up a dozen flick knives. Had some difficulty persuading the men to give them up, but he\u0027s done it. He\u0027s barbed them and sharpened them down almost to needles, then fitted them into the tops of broom handles. Guess he\u0027ll make you sign an indent for the brooms or he\u0027ll have the supply officer on top of him when we get out of this. All right then. Be seeing you. Ask for anything you want.? He turned back to the plot. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond and Leiter followed Petty Officer Fallon along the lower deck to the engine room and then to the engine-repair shop. On their way they passed through the reactor room. The reactor, the equivalent of a controlled atomic bomb, was an obscene knee-level bulge rising out of the thickly leaded deck. As they passed it, Leiter whispered to Bond, ?Liquid sodium Submarine Intermediate Reactor Mark B.? He grinned sourly and crossed himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond gave the thing a sideways kick with his shoe. ?Steam-age stuff. Our Navy\u0027s got the Mark C.? \\n\\n \\n\\n The repair shop, a long low room equipped with various forms of precision machinery, presented a curious sight. At one end were grouped the nine swimmers clad only in bathing trunks, their fine bodies glowing with sunburn. At the other, two men in gray overalls, drab figures of the machine age, were working in semi-darkness with only pinpoints of bright light cast on the whirring lathes from which the knife blades threw small fountains of blue and orange sparks. Some of the swimmers already had their spears. After the introductions, Bond took one and examined it. It was a deadly weapon, the blade, sharpened to a stiletto and notched near the top into a barb, firmly wired into the top of a long stout stave. Bond thumbed the needle-sharp steel and touched the tip. Even a shark\u0027s skin would not stand up to that. But what would the enemy have? CO2 guns for a certainty. Bond looked the smiling bronzed young men over. There were going to be casualties-perhaps many. Everything must be done to effect surprise. But those golden skins and his own and Leiter\u0027s paler skins would show at twenty feet in the moonlight-all right for the guns, but well out of range of the spears. Bond turned to Petty Officer Fallon: ?I suppose you don\u0027t have rubber suits on board?? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?Why sure, Commander. Have to, for escape in cold waters.? He smiled. ?We\u0027re not always sailing among the palm trees.? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?We\u0027ll all need them. And could you get white or yellow numbers, big ones, painted on their backs? Then we\u0027ll know more or less who\u0027s who.? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?Sure, sure.? He called to his men. ?Hey, Fonda and Johnson. Go along to the Quartermaster and draw rubber suits for the whole team. Bracken, get a pail of rubber solution paint from Stores. Paint numbers on the backs of the suits. A foot deep. From one to twelve. Get going.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Later, with the gleaming black suits hanging like giant bat skins along the wall, Bond called the team together. ?Men, we\u0027re going to have one hell of an underwater battle. There\u0027ll be casualties. Anyone care to change his mind?? The faces grinned back at him. ?All right, then. Now, we\u0027ll be swimming at around ten feet for a quarter, perhaps half a mile. It\u0027ll be pretty light. The moon\u0027ll be up and the bottom\u0027s white sand with some seagrass. We\u0027ll take it easy and go in triangle formation with me, No. 1, leading followed by Mr. Leiter here as No. 2, and Petty Officer Fallon as No. 3. Then we broaden out behind like a wedge of geese. All you have to do is follow the number in front of you and no one\u0027ll get lost. Watch out for isolated niggerheads. As far as I can gather from the chart there\u0027s no true reef, only broken clumps. It\u0027ll be getting on for early feeding time for the fish, so watch out for anything big. But leave it alone unless it gets too inquisitive. Then three of you take it on with the spears. But don\u0027t forget that it\u0027s most unlikely any fish will attack us. Close together we\u0027ll look like one hell of a big black fish to anyone else and I guess we\u0027ll be given a wide berth. Watch out for sea eggs on the coral and mind the tips of your spears. Hold them right up near the blade. Above all, keep quiet. We must try and get surprise on our side. The enemy\u0027s got CO2 guns, range above twenty feet. But they\u0027re slow things to reload. If one\u0027s aimed at you, try and give a small target. Keep flat in the water. Don\u0027t put your feet down and give him a full-length target. As soon as he\u0027s fired, go for him like hell with your spear right out. One jab of those things in almost any part of the head or body and your man\u0027s had it. Wounded men will have to look after themselves. We can\u0027t spare stretcher bearers. If you\u0027re wounded, back out of the fight and get away to a coral clump and rest on it. Or make for the shore and shallow water. If you\u0027ve got a spear in you, don\u0027t try and pull it out. Just hold it in the wound until someone gets to you. Petty Officer Fallon will have one of the ship\u0027s signal flares. He\u0027ll release that to the surface as soon as our attack begins and your captain will at once surface and put out an escape dinghy with an armed party and the ship\u0027s surgeon. Now then, any questions?? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?What do we do as soon as we get out of the sub, sir?? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?Try and not make any fuss on the surface. Get down quickly to ten feet and take your place in the formation. We\u0027re likely to get help from a light breeze, but we\u0027re bound to create turbulence on the surface. Keep it down as much as you can.? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?What about signals underwater, sir? Suppose a mask goes wrong or something.? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?Thumbs down for any kind of emergency. Arm held straight out for a big fish. Thumbs up means `I understand\u0027 or `Coming to help you.\u0027 That\u0027s all you\u0027ll need.? Bond smiled. ?If the feet go up, that\u0027s the signal that you\u0027ve had it.? \\n\\n \\n\\n The men laughed various kinds of laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n There came the sudden voice of the P.A. system. ?Swimming party to the escape hatch. I repeat, swimming party to the escape hatch. Don equipment, Don equipment. Commander Bond to the attack center, please.? \\n\\n \\n\\n The whine of the engines died to a moan and then was silent. There was a slight bump as the Manta hit bottom. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1583/47080.html","bookId":1267,"book":{"id":1267,"title":"007之霹雳弹 Thunderball","description":"简介： 魔鬼党是一个世界性的恐怖组织，专门从事毒品、抢劫、勒索等国际性案件。某日，魔鬼党拦截了美国运往英国的两枚原子弹，并向英国首相勒索1亿英镑，否则将于七天内炸毁英国各大城市。英方情急之下，派遣007前往魔鬼党总部，并同杜明娜内应终于拆除核弹引线，阻止了大灾难...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/20/09-21-12-54-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1583","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
