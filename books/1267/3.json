{"id":23747,"no":3,"title":"3. The Rack","content":"At the end of the hour\u0027s treatment Bond felt as if his body had been eviscerated and then run through a wringer. He put on his clothes and, cursing M, climbed weakly back up the stairs into what, by comparison with the world of nakedness and indignities in the basement, were civilized surroundings. At the entrance to the main lounge were two telephone booths. The switchboard put him through to the only Headquarters number he was allowed to call on an outside line. He knew that all such outside calls were monitored. As he asked for Records, he recognized the hollowness on the line that meant the line was bugged. He gave him number to Head of Records and put his question, adding that the subject was an Oriental probably of Portuguese extraction. After ten minutes Head of Records came back to him. ?It\u0027s a Tong sign.? His voice sounded interested. ?The Red Lightning Tong. Unusual to find anyone but a full-blooded Chinaman being a member. It\u0027s not the usual semi-religious organization. This is entirely criminal. Station H had dealings with it once. They\u0027re represented in Hong Kong, but their headquarters are across the bay in Macao. Station H paid big money to get a courier service running into Peking. Worked like a dream, so they gave the line a trial with some heavy stuff. It bounced, badly. Lost a couple of H\u0027s top men. It was a double-cross. Turned out that Redland had some sort of a deal with these people. Hell of a mess. Since then they\u0027ve cropped up from time to time in drugs, gold smuggling to India, and top-bracket white slavery. They\u0027re big people. We\u0027d be interested if you\u0027ve got any kind of a line.? Bond said, ?Thanks, Records. No, I\u0027ve got nothing definite. First time I\u0027ve heard of these Red Lightning people. Let you know if anything develops. So long.? Bond thoughtfully put back the receiver. How interesting! Now what the hell could this man be doing at Shrublands? Bond walked out of the booth. A movement in the next booth caught his eye. Count Lippe, his back to Bond, had just picked up the receiver. How long had he been in there? Had he heard Bond\u0027s inquiry? Or his comment? Bond had the crawling sensation at the pit of his stomach he knew so well-the signal that he had probably made a dangerous and silly mistake. He glanced at his watch. It was seven-thirty. He walked through the lounge to the sun parlor where ?dinner? was being served. He gave his name to the elderly woman with a wardress face behind a long counter. She consulted a list and ladled hot vegetable soup into a plastic mug. Bond took the mug. He said anxiously, ?Is that all?? The woman didn\u0027t smile. She said severely, ?You\u0027re lucky. You Wouldn\u0027t be getting as much on Starvation. And you may have soup every day at midday and two cups of tea at four o\u0027clock.? Bond gave her a bitter smile. He took the horrible mug over to one of the little café tables near the windows overlooking the dark lawn and sat down and sipped the thin soup while he watched some of his fellow inmates meandering aimlessly, weakly, through the room. Now he felt a grain of sympathy for the wretches. Now he was a member of their club. Now he had been initiated. He drank the soup down to the last neat cube of carrot and walked abstractedly off to his room, thinking of Count Lippe, thinking of sleep, but above all thinking of his empty stomach. After two days of this, Bond felt terrible. He had a permanent slight nagging headache, the whites of his eyes had turned rather yellow, and his tongue was deeply furred. His masseur told him not to worry. This was as it should be. These were the poisons leaving his body. Bond, now a permanent prey to lassitude, didn\u0027t argue. Nothing seemed to matter any more but the single orange and hot water for breakfast, the mugs of hot soup, and the cups of tea which Bond filled with spoonfuls of brown sugar, the only variety that had Mr. Wain\u0027s sanction. On the third day, after the massage and the shock of the sitz baths, Bond had on his program ?Osteopathic Manipulation and Traction.? He was directed to a new section of the basement, withdrawn and silent. When he opened the designated door he expected to find some hairy H-man waiting for him with flexed muscles. (H-man, he had discovered, stood for Health-man. It was the smart thing to call oneself if you were a naturopath.) He stopped in his tracks. The girl, Patricia something, whom he had not set eyes on since his first day, stood waiting for him beside the couch. He closed the door behind him and said, ?Good lord. Is this what you do?? She was used to this reaction of the men patients and rather touchy about it. She didn\u0027t smile. She said in a business-like voice, ?Nearly ten per cent of osteopaths are women. Take off your clothes, please. Everything except your shorts.? When Bond had amusedly obeyed she told him to stand in front of her. She walked round him, examining him with eyes in which there was nothing but professional interest. Without commenting on his scars she told him to lie face downward on the couch and, with strong, precise, and thoroughly practiced holds, went through the handling and joint-cracking of her profession. Bond soon realized that she was an extremely powerful girl. His muscled body, admittedly unresistant, seemed to be easy going for her. Bond felt a kind of resentment at the neutrality of this relationship between an attractive girl and a half-naked man. At the end of the treatment she told him to stand up and clasp his hands behind her neck. Her eyes, a few inches away from his, held nothing but professional concentration. She hauled strongly away from him, presumably with the object of freeing his vertebrae. This was too much for Bond. At the end of it, when she told him to release his hands, he did nothing of the sort. He tightened them, pulled her head sharply toward him, and kissed her full on the lips. She ducked quickly down through his arms and straightened herself, her cheeks red and her eyes shining with anger. Bond smiled at her, knowing that he had never missed a slap in the face, and a hard one at that, by so little. He said, ?It\u0027s all very well, but I just had to do it. You shouldn\u0027t have a mouth like that if you\u0027re going to be an osteopath.? The anger in her eyes subsided a fraction. She said, ?The last time that happened, the man had to leave by the next train.? Bond laughed. He made a threatening move toward her. ?If I thought there was any hope of being kicked out of this damn place I\u0027d kiss you again.? She said, ?Don\u0027t be silly. Now pick up your things. You\u0027ve got half an hour\u0027s traction.? She smiled grimly. ?That ought to keep you quiet.? Bond said morosely, ?Oh, all right. But only on condition you let me take you out on your next day off.? ?We\u0027ll see about that. It depends how you behave at the next treatment.? She held open the door. Bond picked up his clothes and went out, almost colliding with a man coming down the passage. It was Count Lippe, in slacks and a gay windcheater. He ignored Bond. With a smile and a slight bow he said to the girl, ?Here comes the lamb to the slaughter. I hope you\u0027re not feeling too strong today.? His eyes twinkled charmingly. The girl said briskly, ?Just get ready, please. I shan\u0027t be a moment putting Mr. Bond on the traction table.? She moved off down the passage with Bond following. She opened the door of a small anteroom, told Bond to put his things down on a chair, and pulled aside plastic curtains that formed a partition. Just inside the curtains was an odd-looking kind of surgical couch in leather and gleaming aluminum. Bond didn\u0027t like the look of it at all. While the girl fiddled with a series of straps attached to three upholstered sections that appeared to be on runners, Bond examined the contraption suspiciously. Below the couch was a stout electric motor on which a plate announced that this was the Hercules Motorized Traction Table. A power drive in the shape of articulated rods stretched upward from the motor to each of the three cushioned sections of the couch and terminated in tension screws to which the three sets of straps were attached. In front of the raised portion where the patient\u0027s head would lie, and approximately level with his face, was a large dial marked in lbs.-pressure up to 200. After 150 lbs. the numerals were in red. Below the headrest were grips for the patient\u0027s hands. Bond noted gloomily that the leather on the grips was stained with, presumably, sweat. ?Lie face downward here, please.? The girl held the straps ready. Bond said obstinately, ?Not until you tell me what this thing does. I don\u0027t like the look of it.? The girl said patiently, ?This is simply a machine for stretching your spine. You\u0027ve got mild spinal lesions. It will help to free those. And at the base of your spine you\u0027ve got some right sacroiliac strain. It\u0027ll help that too. You won\u0027t find it bad at all. Just a stretching sensation. It\u0027s very soothing, really. Quite a lot of patients fall asleep.? ?This one won\u0027t,? said Bond firmly. ?What strength are you going to give me? Why are those top figures in red? Are you sure I\u0027m not going to be pulled apart?? The girl said with a touch of impatience, ?Don\u0027t be silly. Of course if there was too much tension it might be dangerous. But I shall be starting you only at 90 pounds and in a quarter of an hour I shall come and see how you\u0027re getting on and probably put you up to 120. Now come along. I\u0027ve got another patient waiting.? Reluctantly Bond climbed up on the couch and lay on his face with his nose and mouth buried in a deep cleft in the headrest. He said, his voice muffled by the leather, ?If you kill me, I\u0027ll sue.? He felt the straps being tightened round his chest and then round his hips. The girl\u0027s skirt brushed the side of his face as she bent to reach the control lever beside the big dial. The motor began to whine. The straps tightened and then relaxed, tightened and relaxed. Bond felt as if his body was being stretched by giant hands. It was a curious sensation, but not unpleasant. With difficulty Bond raised his head. The needle on the dial stood at 90. Now the machine was making a soft iron hee-hawing, like a mechanical donkey, as the gears alternatively engaged and disengaged to produce the rhythmic traction. ?Are you all right?? ?Yes.? He heard the girl pass through the plastic curtains and then the click of the outer door. Bond abandoned himself to the soft feel of the leather at his face, to the relentless intermittent haul on his spine and to the hypnotic whine and drone of the machine. It really wasn\u0027t too bad. How silly to have had nerves about it! A quarter of an hour later he heard again the click of the outside door and the swish of the curtains. ?All right?? ?Fine.? The girl\u0027s hand came into his line of vision as she turned the lever. Bond raised his head. The needle crept up to 120. Now the pull was really hard and the voice of the machine was much louder. The girl put her head down to his. She laid a reassuring hand on his shoulder. She said, her voice loud above the noise of the gears, ?Only another quarter of an hour to go.? ?All right.? Bond\u0027s voice was careful. He was probing the new strength of the giant haul on his body. The curtains swished. Now the click of the outside door was drowned by the noise of the machine. Slowly Bond relaxed again into the arms of the rhythm. It was perhaps five minutes later when a tiny movement of the air against his face made Bond open his eyes. In front of his eyes was a hand, a man\u0027s hand, reaching softly for the lever of the accelerator. Bond watched it, at first fascinated, and then with dawning horror as the lever was slowly depressed and the straps began to haul madly at his body. He shouted-something, he didn\u0027t know what. His whole body was racked with a great pain. Desperately he lifted his head and shouted again. On the dial, the needle was trembling at 200! His head dropped back, exhausted. Through a mist of sweat he watched the hand softly release the lever. The hand paused and turned slowly so that the back of the wrist was just below his eyes. In the center of the wrist was the little red sign of the zigzag and the two bisecting lines. A voice said quietly, close up against his ear, ?You will not meddle again, my friend.? Then there was nothing but the great whine and groan of the machine and the bite of the straps that were tearing his body in half. Bond began to scream, weakly, while the sweat poured from him and dripped off the leather cushions onto the floor. Then suddenly there was blackness.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1583/47061.html","bookId":1267,"book":{"id":1267,"title":"007之霹雳弹 Thunderball","description":"简介： 魔鬼党是一个世界性的恐怖组织，专门从事毒品、抢劫、勒索等国际性案件。某日，魔鬼党拦截了美国运往英国的两枚原子弹，并向英国首相勒索1亿英镑，否则将于七天内炸毁英国各大城市。英方情急之下，派遣007前往魔鬼党总部，并同杜明娜内应终于拆除核弹引线，阻止了大灾难...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/20/09-21-12-54-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1583","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
