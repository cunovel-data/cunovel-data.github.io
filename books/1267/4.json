{"id":23748,"no":4,"title":"4. Tea and Animosity","content":"It is just as well that the body retains no memory of pain. Yes, it hurt, that abscess, that broken bone, but just how it hurt, and how much, is soon forgotten by the brain and the nerves. It is not so with pleasant sensations, a scent, a taste, the particular texture of a kiss. These things can be almost totally recalled. Bond, gingerly exploring his sensations as life came flooding back into his body, was astonished that the web of agony that had held his body so utterly had now completely dissolved. It was true that his whole spine ached as if it had been beaten, each vertebra separately, with wooden truncheons, but his pain was recognizable, something within his knowledge and therefore capable of control. The searing tornado that had entered his body and utterly dominated it, replacing his identity with its own, had gone. How had it been? What had it been like? Bond couldn\u0027t remember except that it had reduced him to something lower in the scale of existence than a handful of grass in the mouth of a tiger. The murmur of voices grew more distinct. \\n\\n \\n\\n ?But what told you first that something was wrong, Miss Fearing?? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?It was the noise, the noise of the machine. I had just finished a treatment. A few minutes later I heard it. I\u0027d never heard it so loud. I thought perhaps the door had been left open. I wasn\u0027t really worried but I came along to make sure. And there it was. The indicator up to 200! I tore down the lever and got the straps off and ran to the surgery and found the coramine and injected it into the vein-one c.c, The pulse was terribly weak. Then I telephoned you.? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?You seem to have done everything possible, Miss Fearing. And I\u0027m sure you bear no responsibility for this terrible thing.? Mr. Wain\u0027s voice was doubtful. ?It really is most unfortunate. I suppose the patient must have jerked the lever, somehow. Perhaps he was experimenting. He might easily have killed himself. We must tell the company about this and have some safety arrangement installed.? \\n\\n \\n\\n A hand gingerly clasped Bond\u0027s wrist, feeling for his pulse. Bond thought it was time to re-enter the world. He must quickly get himself a doctor, a real one, not one of these grated-carrot merchants. A sudden wave of anger poured through him. This was all M\u0027s fault. M was mad. He would have it out with him when he got back to Headquarters. If necessary he would go higher-to the Chiefs of Staff, the Cabinet, the Prime Minister. M was a dangerous lunatic-a danger to the country. It was up to Bond to save England. The weak, hysterical thoughts whirled through his brain, mixed themselves up with the hairy hand of Count Lippe, the mouth of Patricia Fearing, the taste of hot vegetable soup, and, as consciousness slipped away from him again the diminishing voice of Mr. Wain: ?No structural damage. Only considerable surface abrasion of the nerve ends. And of course shock. You will take personal charge of the case, Miss Fearing. Rest, warmth, and effleurage. Is that under . . . ?? \\n\\n \\n\\n *** \\n\\n \\n\\n Rest, warmth, and effleurage. When Bond came round again, he was lying face downward on his bed and his whole body was bathed in exquisite sensation. Beneath him was the soft warmth of an electric blanket, his back glowed with the heat from two large sun lamps, and two hands, clad in what felt to be some particularly velvety fur, were rhythmically passing, one after the other, up and down the whole length of his body from his neck to the backs of his knees. It was a most gentle and almost piercingly luxurious experience, and Bond lay and bathed himself in it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently he said sleepily, ?Is that what they call effleurage?? \\n\\n \\n\\n The girl\u0027s voice said softly, ?I thought you\u0027d come round. The whole tone of your skin suddenly changed. How are you feeling?? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?Wonderful. I\u0027d be still better for a double whisky on the rocks.? \\n\\n \\n\\n The girl laughed. ?Mr. Wain did say dandelion tea would be best for you. But I thought a little stimulant might be good, I mean just this once. So I brought the brandy with me. And there\u0027s plenty of ice as I\u0027m going to give you an ice-pack presently. Would you really like some? Wait, I\u0027ll put your dressing gown over you and then you can see if you can turn over. I\u0027ll look the other way.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond heard the lamps being pulled away. Gingerly, he turned on his side. The dull ache returned, but it was already wearing off. He cautiously slipped his legs over the side of the bed and sat up. \\n\\n \\n\\n Patricia Fearing stood in front of him, clean, white, comforting, desirable. In one hand was a pair of heavy mink gloves, but with the fur covering the palm instead of the back. In the other was a glass. She held out the glass. As Bond drank and heard the reassuring, real-life tinkle of the ice, he thought: This is a most splendid girl. I will settle down with her. She will give me effleurage all day long and from time to time a good tough drink like this. It will be a life of great beauty. He smiled at her and held out the empty glass and said, ?More.? \\n\\n \\n\\n She laughed, mostly with relief that he was completely alive again. She took the glass and said, ?Well, just one more, then. But don\u0027t forget it\u0027s on an empty stomach. It may make you dreadfully tight.? She paused with the brandy bottle in her hand. Suddenly her gaze was cool, clinical. ?And now you must try and tell me what happened. Did you accidentally touch the lever or something? You gave us all a dreadful fright. Nothing like that has ever happened before. The traction table\u0027s really perfectly safe, you know.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond looked candidly into her eyes. He said reassuringly, ?Of course. I was just trying to get more comfortable. I heaved about and I do remember that my hand hit something rather hard. I suppose it must have been the lever. Then I don\u0027t remember any more. I must have been awfully lucky you came along so quickly.? \\n\\n \\n\\n She handed him the fresh drink. ?Well, it\u0027s all over now. And thank heavens nothing\u0027s badly strained. Another two days of treatment and you\u0027ll be right as rain.? She paused. She looked rather embarrassed, ?Oh, and Mr. Wain asks if you could possibly keep all this, all this trouble, to yourself. He doesn\u0027t want the other patients to get worried.? \\n\\n \\n\\n I should think not, thought Bond. He could see the headlines, ?PATIENT TORN NEARLY LIMB FROM LIMB AT NATURE CLINIC. RACK MACHINE GOES BERSERK. MINISTRY OF HEALTH STEPS IN.? \\n\\n \\n\\n He said, ?Of course I won\u0027t say anything. It was my fault, anyway.? He finished his drink, handed back the glass, and cautiously lay back on the bed. He said, ?That was marvelous. Now how about some more of the mini treatment. And by the way. Will you marry me? You\u0027re the only girl I\u0027ve ever met who knows how to treat a man properly.? \\n\\n \\n\\n She laughed. ?Don\u0027t be silly. And turn over on your face. It\u0027s your back that needs treatment.? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?How do you know?? \\n\\n \\n\\n *** \\n\\n \\n\\n Two days later, Bond was once more back in the half-world of the nature cure. The routine of the early morning glass of hot water, the orange, carefully sliced into symmetrical pigs by some ingenious machine wielded, no doubt, by the wardress in charge of diets, then the treatments, the hot soup, the siesta, and the blank, aimless walk or bus ride to the nearest tea shop for the priceless strength-giving cups of tea laced with brown sugar. Bond loathed and despised tea, that flat, soft, time-wasting opium of the masses, but on his empty stomach, and in his febrile state, the sugary brew acted almost as an intoxicant. Three cups, he reckoned, had the effect, not of hard liquor. but of just about half a bottle of champagne in the outside world, in real life. He got to know them all, these dainty opium dens-Rose Cottage, which he avoided after the woman charged him extra for emptying the sugar bowl; The Thatched Barn, which amused him because it was a real den of iniquity-large plates of sugar cakes put on one\u0027s table, the piercing temptation of the smell of hot scones; The Transport Cafe, where the Indian tea was black and strong and the lorry drivers brought in a smell of sweat and petrol and the great world (Bond found that all his senses, particularly his palate and nose, had miraculously become sharpened), and a dozen other cottagey, raftery nooks where elderly couples with Ford Populars and Morris Minors talked in muted tones about children called Len and Ron and Pearl and Ethel, and ate in small mouthfuls with the points of their teeth and made not a sound with the tea things. It was all a world whose ghastly daintiness and propriety would normally have sickened him. NOW, empty, weak, drained of all the things that belonged to his tough, fast, basically dirty life, through banting, he had somehow regained some of the innocence and purity of childhood. In this frame of mind the na?veté and total lack of savor, surprise, excitement, of the dimity world of the Nice-Cup-of-Tea, of the Home-Made Cakes, and the One-Lump-or-Two, were perfectly acceptable. \\n\\n \\n\\n And the extraordinary thing was that he could not remember when he had felt so well-not strong, but without any aches and pains, clear of eye and skin, sleeping ten hours a day and, above all, without that nagging sense of morning guilt that one is slowly wrecking one\u0027s body. It was really quite disturbing. Was his personality changing? Was he losing his edge, his point, his identity? Was he losing the vices that were so much part of his ruthless, cruel, fundamentally tough character? Who was he in process of becoming? A soft, dreaming, kindly idealist who would naturally leave the Service and become instead a prison visitor, interest himself in youth clubs, march with the H-bomb marchers, eat nut cutlets, try and change the world for the better? James Bond would have been more worried, as day by day the H-cure drew his teeth, if it had not been for three obsessions which belonged to his former life and which would not leave him-a passionate longing for a large dish of Spaghetti Bolognese containing plenty of chopped garlic and accompanied by a whole bottle of the cheapest, rawest Chianti (bulk for his empty stomach and sharp tastes for his starved palate), an overwhelming desire for the strong, smooth body of Patricia Fearing, and a deadly concentration on ways and means to wring the guts of Count Lippe. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first two would have to wait, though tantalizing schemes for consuming both dishes on the day of his release from Shrublands occupied much of his mind. So far as Count Lippe was concerned, work had started on the project from the moment Bond took up again the routine of the cure. \\n\\n \\n\\n With the cold intensity he would have employed against an enemy agent, say in a hotel in Stockholm or Lisbon during the war, James Bond set about spying on the other man. He became garrulous and inquisitive, chatting with Patricia Fearing about the various routines at Shrublands. ?But when do the staff find time to have lunch?? ?That man Lippe looks very fit. Oh, he\u0027s worried about his waist-line! Aren\u0027t the electric blanket-baths good for that? No, I haven\u0027t seen the Turkish Bath Cabinet. Must have a look at it sometime.? And to his masseur: ?Haven\u0027t seen that big chap about lately, Count something-Ripper? Hipper? Oh yes, Lippe. Oh, noon every day? I think I must try and get that time as well. Nice being clear for the rest of the day. And I\u0027d like to have a spell in the Turkish Bath thing when you\u0027ve finished the massage. Need a good sweat.? Innocently, fragment by fragment, James Bond built up a plan of operations-a plan that would leave him and Lippe alone among the machinery of the soundproof treatment rooms. \\n\\n \\n\\n For there would be no other opportunity. Count Lippe kept to his room in the main building until his treatment time at noon. In the afternoons he swished away in the violet Bentley-to Bournemouth, it seemed, where he had ?business.? The night porter let him in around eleven each night. One afternoon-in the siesta hour-Bond slipped the Yale lock on Count Lippe\u0027s room with a straight piece of plastic cut off a child\u0027s airplane he had bought for the purpose in Washington. He went over the room meticulously and drew a blank. All he learned-from the clothes-was that the Count was a much-traveled man-shirts from Charvet, ties from Tripler, Dior, and Hardy Amies, shoes from Peel, and raw-silk pajamas from Hong Kong. The dark red morocco suitcase from Mark Cross might have contained secrets, and Bond eyed the silk linings and toyed with the Count\u0027s Wilkinson razor. But no! Better that revenge, if it could be contrived, should come out of a clear sky. \\n\\n \\n\\n That same afternoon, drinking his treacly tea, Bond scraped together the meager scraps of his knowledge of Count Lippe. He was about thirty, attractive to women, and physically, to judge from the naked body Bond had seen, very strong. His blood would be Portuguese with a dash of Chinaman and he gave the appearance of wealth. What did he do? What was his profession? At first glance Bond would have put him down as a tough maquereau from the Ritz bar in Paris, the Palace at St. Moritz, the Carlton at Cannes-good at backgammon, polo, water-skiing, but with the yellow streak of the man who lives on women. But Lippe had heard Bond making inquiries about him and that had been enough for an act of violence-an inspired act that he had carried out swiftly and coolly when he finished his treatment with the Fearing girl and knew, from her remark, that Bond would be alone on the traction table. The act of violence might only have been designed to warn, but equally, since Lippe could only guess at the effect of a 200-pound pull on the spine, it might have been designed to kill. Why? Who was this man who had so much to hide? And what were his secrets? Bond poured the last of his tea on to a mound of brown sugar. One thing was certain-the secrets were big ones. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond never seriously considered telling Headquarters about Lippe and what he had done to Bond. The whole thing, against the background of Shrublands, was so unlikely and so utterly ridiculous. And somehow Bond, the man of action and resource, came out of it all as something of a ninny. Weakened by a diet of hot water and vegetable soup, the ace of the Secret Service had been tied to some kind of a rack and then a man had come along and just pulled a lever up a few notches and reduced the hero of a hundred combats to a quivering jelly! No! There was only one solution-a private solution, man to man. Later perhaps, to satisfy his curiosity, it might be amusing to put through a good Trace on Count Lippe-with S.I.S. Records, with the C.I.D., with the Hong Kong Station. But for the time being Bond would stay quiet, keep out of Count Lippe\u0027s way, and plan meticulously for just the right kind of pay-off. \\n\\n \\n\\n By the time the fourteenth day, the last day, came, Bond had it all fixed-the time, the place, and the method. \\n\\n \\n\\n At ten o\u0027clock Mr. Joshua Wain received Bond for his final checkup. When Bond came into the consulting room, Mr. Wain was standing by the open window doing deep-breathing exercises. With a final thorough exhalation through the nostrils he turned to greet Bond with an Ah! Bisto! expression on his healthily flushed face. His smile was elastic with good-fellowship. ?And how\u0027s the world treating you, Mr. Bond? No ill effects from that unhappy little accident? No. Quite so. The body is a most remarkable piece of mechanism. Extraordinary power of recovery. Now then, shirt off, please, and we\u0027ll see what Shrublands has managed to do for you.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Ten minutes later, Bond, blood pressure down to 132/84, weight reduced by ten pounds, osteopathic lesions gone, clear of eye and tongue, was on his way down to the basement rooms for his final treatment. \\n\\n \\n\\n As usual, it was clammily quiet and neutral-smelling in the white rooms and corridors. From the separate cubicles there came an occasional soft exchange between patient and staff, and, in the background, intermittent plumbing noises. The steady whir of the ventilation system created the impression of the deep innards of a liner in a dead calm. It was nearly twelve-thirty. Bond lay face down on the massage table and listened for the authoritative voice and the quick slap of the naked feet of his prey. The door at the end of the corridor sighed open and sighed shut again. ?Morning, Beresford. All ready for me? Make it good and hot today. Last treatment. Three more ounces to lose. Right?? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?Very good, sir.? The gym shoes of the chief attendant, followed by the slapping feet, came down the corridor outside the plastic curtain of the massage room and on to the end room of all, the electric Turkish bath. The door sighed shut and a few minutes later sighed again as the attendant, having installed Count Lippe, came back down the corridor. Twenty minutes went by. Twenty-five. Bond rolled off the table. ?Well, thanks, Sam. You\u0027ve done me a power of good. I\u0027ll be back to see you again one of these days, I expect. I\u0027ll just go along and have a final salt rub and a sitz bath. You cut along to your carrot cutlets. Don\u0027t worry about me. I\u0027ll let myself out when I\u0027ve finished.? Bond wrapped a towel round his waist and moved off down the corridor. There was a flurry of movement and voices as the attendants got rid of their patients and made their way through the staff door for the luncheon break. The last patient, a reformed drunk, called back from the entrance, ?See you later, Irrigator!? Somebody laughed. Now the petty-officer voice of Beresford sounded down the corridor, making certain that everything was shipshape: ?Windows, Bill? Okay. Your next is Mr. Dunbar at two sharp. Len, tell the laundry we shall need more towels after lunch. Ted . . . Ted. You there, Ted? Well, then, Sam, look after Count Lippe, would you, Turkish bath.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond had listened to this routine for a whole week, noting the men that cut minutes off their duty and got off early to lunch, noting the ones that stayed to do their full share of the last chores. Now, from the open door of the empty shower room, he called back, in Sam\u0027s deep voice, ?Okay, Mr. Beresford,? and waited for the crisp squeak of the gym shoes on the linoleum. There it was! The brief pause halfway down the corridor and then the double sigh as the staff door opened and shut. Now there was dead silence save for the hum of the fans. The treatment rooms were empty. Now there was only James Bond and Count Lippe. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond waited a moment and then came out of the shower room and softly opened the door to the Turkish bath. He had had one session in the place, just to get the geography clear in his mind, and the scene was exactly as he remembered. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a white cubicle treatment room like all the others, but in this one the only object was a big cream metal-and-plastic box about five feet tall by four feet square. It was closed on all sides but the top. The front of the big cabinet was hinged to allow a patient to climb in and sit inside and there was a hole in the top with a foam-rubber support for the nape of the neck and the chin, through which the patient\u0027s head emerged. The rest of his body was exposed to the heat from many rows of naked electric bulbs inside the cabinet and the degree of heat was thermostatically controlled by a dial at the back of the cabinet. It was a simple sweat box, designed, as Bond had noticed on his previous visit to the room, by the Medikalischer Maschinenbau G.m.b.H., 44 Franziskanerstrasse, Ulm, Bavaria. \\n\\n \\n\\n The cabinet faced away from the door. At the hiss of the hydraulic fastener, Count Lippe said angrily, ?Goddammit, Beresford. Let me out of this thing. I\u0027m sweating like a pig.? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?You said you wanted it hot, sir.? Bond\u0027s amiable voice was a good approximation to the chief attendant\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n ?Don\u0027t argue, goddammit. Let me out of here.? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?I don\u0027t think you quite realize the value of heat in the H-cure, sir. Heat resolves many of the toxins in the blood stream and for the matter of that in the muscle tissue also. A patient suffering from your condition of pronounced toxemia will find much benefit from the heat treatment.? Bond found the H-lingo rattling quite easily off the tongue. He was not worried about the consequences to Beresford. He would have the solid alibi of luncheon in the staff canteen. \\n\\n \\n\\n ?Don\u0027t give me that crap. I tell you, let me out of here.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond examined the dial on the back of the machine. The needle stood at 120. What should he give the man? The dial ran up to 200 degrees. That much might roast him alive. This was only to be a punishment, not a murder. Perhaps 180 would be a just retribution. Bond clicked the knob up to 180. He said, ?I think just half an hour of real heat will do you the world of good, sir.? Bond dropped the sham voice. He added sharply, ?And if you catch fire you can sue.? \\n\\n \\n\\n The dripping head tried to turn, failed. Bond moved toward the door. Count Lippe now had a new voice, controlled but desperate. He said woodenly, concealing the knowledge and the hate, ?Give you a thousand pounds and we\u0027re quits.? He heard the hiss of the open door. ?Ten thousand. All right then, fifty.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond closed the door firmly behind him and walked quickly down the corridor to put on his clothes and get out. Behind him, deeply muffled, came the first shout for help. Bond closed his ears. There was nothing that a painful week in hospital and plenty of gentian violet or tannic acid jelly wouldn\u0027t cure. But it did cross his mind that a man who could offer a bribe of fifty thousand pounds must be either very rich or have some very urgent reason for needing freedom of movement. It was surely too much to pay just for avoidance of pain. \\n\\n \\n\\n *** \\n\\n \\n\\n James Bond was right. The outcome of this rather childish trial of strength between two extremely tough and ruthless men, in the bizarre surroundings of a nature clinic in Sussex, was to upset, if only in a minute fashion, the exactly timed machinery of a plot that was about to shake the governments of the Western world. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1583/47062.html","bookId":1267,"book":{"id":1267,"title":"007之霹雳弹 Thunderball","description":"简介： 魔鬼党是一个世界性的恐怖组织，专门从事毒品、抢劫、勒索等国际性案件。某日，魔鬼党拦截了美国运往英国的两枚原子弹，并向英国首相勒索1亿英镑，否则将于七天内炸毁英国各大城市。英方情急之下，派遣007前往魔鬼党总部，并同杜明娜内应终于拆除核弹引线，阻止了大灾难...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/20/09-21-12-54-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1583","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
