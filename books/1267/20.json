{"id":23764,"no":20,"title":"20. Time for Decision","content":"The interior of the submarine was incredibly roomy, and it was stairs and not a ladder that led down into the interior. There was no clutter, and the sparkling paintwork was in two-tone green. Powerlines painted in vivid colors provided a cheerful contrast to the almost hospital decor. Preceded by the officer of the watch, a young man of about twenty-eight, they went down two decks. The air (70o with 46% humidity, explained the officer) was beautifully cool. At the bottom of the stairs he turned left and knocked on a door that said ? Commander P. Pedersen, U.S.N. ? The captain looked about forty. He had a square, rather Scandinavian face with a black crew-cut just going gray. He had shrewd, humorous eyes but a dangerous mouth and jaw. He was sitting behind a neatly stacked metal desk smoking a pipe. There was an empty coffee cup in front of him and a signal pad on which he had just been writing. He got up and shook hands, waved them to two chairs in front of his desk, and said to the officer of the watch, ?Coffee, please, Stanton. And have this sent, would you?? He tore the top sheet off the signal pad and handed it across. ?Most Immediate.? He sat down. ?Well, gentlemen. Welcome aboard. Commander Bond, it\u0027s a pleasure to have a member of the Royal Navy visit the ship. Ever been in subs before?? ?I have,? said Bond, ?but only as a supercargo. I was in Intelligence-R.N.V.R. Special Branch. Strictly a chocolate sailor.? The captain laughed. ?That\u0027s good! And you, Mr. Leiter?? ?No, Captain. But I used to have one of my own. You operated it with a sort of rubber bulb and tube. Trouble was they\u0027d never let me have enough depth of water in the bath to see what she could really do.? ?Sounds rather like the Navy Department. They\u0027ll never let me try this ship full out. Except once on trials. Every time you want to get going, the needle comes across a damn red line some interfering so-and-so has painted on the dial. Well gentlemen?-the captain looked at Leiter-?what\u0027s the score? Haven\u0027t had such a flood of Top Secret Most Immediates since Korea. I don\u0027t mind telling you, the last one was from the Chief of the Navy, Personal. Said I was to consider myself under your orders, or, on your death or incapacity, under Commander Bond\u0027s, until Admiral Carlson arrives at 1900 this evening. So what? What\u0027s cooking? All I know is that all signals have been prefixed Operation Thunderball. What is this operation?? Bond had greatly taken to Commander Pedersen. He liked his ease and humor and, in general-the old Navy phrase came back to him-the cut of his jib. Now he watched the stolid good-humored face as Leiter told his story down to the departure of Largo\u0027s amphibian at one-thirty and the instructions Bond had given to Domino Vitali. In the background to Leiter\u0027s voice there was a medley of soft noises-the high, constant whine of a generator overlaid by the muted background of canned music-the Ink Spots singing, ?I love coffee, I love tea.? Occasionally the P.A. system above the captain\u0027s desk crackled and sang with operational double-talk-?Roberts to Chief of the Boat?-?Chief Engineer wants Oppenshaw?- ?Team Blue to Compartment F?-and from somewhere came the suck and gurgle of a pumplike apparatus that sounded punctually every two minutes. It was like being inside the simple brain of a robot that worked by hydraulics and electrical impulses with a few promptings from its human masters. After ten minutes, Commander Pedersen sat back. He reached for his pipe and began filling it absent-mindedly. He said, ?Well, that\u0027s one hell of a story.? He smiled. ?And strangely enough, even if I hadn\u0027t had these signals from the Navy Department, I\u0027d believe it. Always did think something like this would happen one of these days. Hell! I have to carry these missiles around, and I\u0027m in command of a nuclear ship. But that doesn\u0027t mean that I\u0027m not terrified by the whole business. Got a wife and two children, and that doesn\u0027t help either. These atomic weapons are just too damned dangerous. Why, any one of these little sandy cays around here could hold the whole of the United States to ransom-just with one of my missiles trained on Miami. And here am I, fellow called Peter Pedersen, age thirty-eight, maybe sane or maybe not, toting around sixteen of the things-enough to damn near wipe out England. However?-he put his hands down on the desk in front of him-?that\u0027s all by the way. Now we\u0027ve got just one small piece of the problem on our hands-small, but as big as the world. So what are we to do? As I see it, the idea of you gentlemen is that this man Largo will be coming back any minute now in his plane after picking up the bombs from where he hid them. If he\u0027s got the bombs, and on what you\u0027ve told me I\u0027ll go along with the probability that he has, this girl will give us the tip-off. Then we close in and arrest his ship or blow it out of the water. Right? But supposing he hasn\u0027t got the bombs on board, or for one reason or another we don\u0027t get the tip-off, what do we do then?? Bond said quietly, ?We follow him, sit close on his tail, until the time limit, that\u0027s about twenty-four hours from now, is up. That\u0027s all we can do without causing one hell of a legal stink. When the time limit\u0027s up, we can hand the whole problem back to our governments and they can decide what to do with the Disco and the sunken plane and all the rest. By that time, some little man in a speedboat we\u0027ve never heard of may have left one of the bombs off the coast of America and Miami may have gone up in the air. Or there may be a big bang somewhere else in the world. There\u0027s been plenty of time to take those bombs off the plane and get them thousands of miles from here. Well, that\u0027ll be too bad and we\u0027ll have muffed it. But at this moment we\u0027re in the position of a detective watching a man he thinks is going to commit a murder. Doesn\u0027t even know for sure whether he\u0027s got a gun on him or not. There\u0027s nothing the detective can do but follow the man and wait until he actually pulls the gun out of his pocket and points it. Then, and only then, the detective can shoot the man or arrest him.? Bond turned to Leiter. ?Isn\u0027t that about it, Felix?? ?That\u0027s how it figures. And Captain, Commander Bond here and I are damn sure Largo\u0027s our man and that he\u0027ll be sailing for his target in no time at all. That\u0027s why we agreed to panic and ask you along. One gets you a hundred he\u0027ll be placing that bomb at night and tonight\u0027s the last night he\u0027s got. By the way, Captain, have you got steam up, or whatever the atom boys call it?? ?I have, and we can be under way in just about five minutes.? The captain shook his head. ?But there\u0027s one bit of bad news for you, gentlemen. I just can\u0027t figure how we\u0027re going to keep track of the Disco .? ?How\u0027s that? You\u0027ve got the speed, haven\u0027t you?? Leiter caught himself pointing his steel hook threateningly at the captain, and hastily brought it down again to his lap. The captain smiled. ?Guess so. Guess we could give her a good race on a straight course, but you gentlemen don\u0027t seem to have figured on the navigational hazards in this part of the ocean.? He pointed at the British Admiralty chart on the wall. ?Take a look at that. Ever seen a chart with so many figures on it? Looks like a spilled ants\u0027 nest. Those are soundings, gentlemen, and I can tell you that unless the Disco sticks to one of the deep-water channels-Tongue of the Ocean, Northwest Providence Channel, or the Northeast- we\u0027ve had it, as Commander Bond would say. All the rest of that area?-he waved a hand-?may look the same blue color on a map, but after your trip in that Grumman Goose you know darned well it isn\u0027t the same blue color. Darned near the whole of that area is banks and shoal with only around three to ten fathoms over it. If I was quite crazy and looking for a nice cosy job ashore, I\u0027d take the ship along surfaced in ten fathoms-if I could bribe the navigator and seal off the echo-sounder from crew members. But even if we got a long spell of ten fathoms on the chart, you got to remember that\u0027s an old chart, dates back to the days of sail, and these banks have been shifting for more than fifty years since it was drawn up. Then there\u0027s the tides that set directly onto and off the banks, and the coral niggerheads that won\u0027t show up on the echo-sounder until you hear the echo of them smashing up the hull or the screw.? The captain turned back to his desk. ?No, gentlemen. This Italian vessel was darned well chosen. With that hydrofoil device of hers, she probably doesn\u0027t draw more than a fathom. If she chooses to keep to the shallows, we just haven\u0027t got a chance. And that\u0027s flat.? The captain looked from one to another of them. ?Want me to call up the Navy Department and have Fort Lauderdale take over with those fighter bombers you\u0027ve got on call-get them to do a shadowing job?? The two men looked at each other. Bond said, ?She won\u0027t be showing lights. They\u0027ll have the hell of a job picking her up at night. What do you say, Felix? Maybe we\u0027d better call them out even if it\u0027s only to keep some sort of a watch off the American coast. Then, if the Captain\u0027s willing, we\u0027ll take the Northwest Channel-if the Disco sails, that is-and bank on the Bahamas Rocket Station being Target No. 1.? Felix Leiter ran his left hand through the mop of straw-colored hair. ?Goddammit,? he said angrily. ?Hell, yes, I suppose so. We\u0027re looking fools enough already bringing the Manta on stage. What\u0027s a squadron of planes? Sure. We\u0027ve just got to back our hunch that it\u0027s Largo and the Disco . Come on, let\u0027s get together with the Captain and whip off a signal that doesn\u0027t look too damned silly-copy to C.I.A. and to your Chief. How do you want it to go?? ?Admiralty for M, prefixed Operation Thunderball.? Bond wiped a hand down over his face. ?God, this is going to put the cat among the pigeons.? He looked up at the big metal wall clock. ?Six. That\u0027ll be midnight in London. Popular time to get a signal like this.? The P.A. system in the ceiling spoke more clearly. ?Watch Officer to Captain. Police officer with urgent message for Commander Bond.? The captain pressed a switch and spoke into a desk microphone. ?Bring him below. Prepare to cast off lines. All hands prepare for sailing.? The captain waited for the acknowledgment and released the switch. The captain smiled across at them. He said to Bond, ?What\u0027s the name of that girl? Domino? Well, Domino, say the good word.? The door opened. A police corporal, his hat off, crashed to attention on the steel flooring and extended a stiff arm. Bond took the buff O.H.M.S. envelope and slit it open. He ran his eyes down the penciled message signed by the Police Commissioner. Unemotionally he read out: *** ?PLANE RETURNED 1730 HOISTED INBOARD, DISCO SAILED AT 1755, FULL SPEED, COURSE NORTHWEST STOP GIRL DID NOT REPEAT NOT REAPPEAR ON DECK AFTER BOARDING. *** Bond borrowed a signal blank from the captain and wrote: *** MANTA WILL ENDEAVOR SHADOW VIA NORTHWEST PROVIDENCE CHANNEL STOP FIGHTER BOMBER SQUADRON FROM FORT LAUDERDALE WILL BE ASKED THROUGH NAVY DEPARTMENT TO COOPERATE WITHIN RADIUS OF TWO HUNDRED MILES OFF FLORIDA COAST STOP MANTA WILL KEEP CONTACT THROUGH WINDSOR FIELD AIR CONTROL STOP NAVY DEPARTMENT AND ADMIRALTY BEING INFORMED STOP PLEASE INFORM GOVERNOR ALSO ADMIRAL CARLSON AND BRIGADIER FAIRCHILD ON ARRIVAL. *** Bond signed the message and passed it to the captain, who also signed, as did Leiter. Bond put the message in an envelope and gave it to the corporal, who wheeled smartly and clanked out in his heavy boots. When the door was shut, the captain pressed down the switch on the intercom. He gave orders to sail, surfaced, course due north, at ten knots. Then he switched off. In the short silence, there was a flurry of background noise, piping of bosuns\u0027 whistles, a thin mechanical whine, and the sound of running feet. The submarine trembled slightly. The captain said quietly, ?Well, gentlemen, that\u0027s that. I\u0027d like to have the goose a bit less wild and a bit more solid. But I\u0027ll be glad to chase her for you. Now then, that signal.? With only half his mind on the wording of the signal, Bond sat and worried about the significance of the Commissioner\u0027s message and about Domino. It looked bad. It looked as if either the plane had not brought back the two bombs, or one of them, in which case the mobilization of the Manta and of the fighter bombers was a pretty meaningless precaution, hardly justified by the evidence. It could easily be that the crashed Vindicator and the missing bombs were the work of some entirely different group and that, while they chased the Disco , the field was being left clear for SPECTRE. But Bond\u0027s instincts refused to allow him to accept this possibility. As cover, the whole Disco -Largo set-up was one hundred per cent watertight. It could not be faulted in any respect. That in itself was enough to arouse Bond\u0027s suspicions. A plot of this magnitude and audacity would only have been conceived under faultless cover and down to the smallest detail. Largo could have just set off on his treasure hunt, and everything, down to the last-minute plane recce of the treasure location, to see if there were any fishing boats about for instance, fitted in with that possibility. Or he could be sailing to lay the bomb, adjust the time fuse for perhaps a few hours after the deadline to allow time for its recovery or destruction if England and America at the last moment agreed to pay the ransom, and get far enough away from the danger area to avoid the explosion and establish an alibi. But where was the bomb? Had it arrived on board in the plane and had Domino for some reason been unable to go up on deck to make her signal? Or was it going to be picked up en route to the target area? The westerly course from Nassau, heading perhaps for the Northwest Light, through the Berry Island Channel, fitted both possibilities. The sunken plane lay westward, south of the Biminis, and so did Miami and other possible targets on the American coast. Or, after passing through the channel, about fifty miles west of Nassau, the Disco could veer sharply northward and, after another fifty miles of sailing through shoal water that would discourage pursuit, get back into the Northwest Providence Channel and make straight for the Grand Bahamas and the missile station. Bond, fretted with indecision and the fear that he and Leiter were making majestic fools of themselves, forced himself to face one certainty-he and Leiter and the Manta were engaged on a crazy gamble. If the bomb was on board, if the Disco veered north for the Grand Bahamas and the missile station, then, by racing up the Northwest Channel, the Manta might intercept her in time. But if this gamble came off, with all its possibilities of error, why hadn\u0027t Domino made her signal? What had happened to her?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1583/47078.html","bookId":1267,"book":{"id":1267,"title":"007之霹雳弹 Thunderball","description":"简介： 魔鬼党是一个世界性的恐怖组织，专门从事毒品、抢劫、勒索等国际性案件。某日，魔鬼党拦截了美国运往英国的两枚原子弹，并向英国首相勒索1亿英镑，否则将于七天内炸毁英国各大城市。英方情急之下，派遣007前往魔鬼党总部，并同杜明娜内应终于拆除核弹引线，阻止了大灾难...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/20/09-21-12-54-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1583","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
