{"id":23757,"no":13,"title":"13. My Name Is Emilio Largo","content":"Leiter\u0027s ?sixpenny sick? was the hotel launch, a smart Chrysler-engined speedboat that said it would be $20 an hour. They ran out westward from the harbor, past Silver Cay, Long Cay, and Balmoral Island and round Delaporte Point. Five miles farther down the coast, encrusted with glittering seashore properties the boatman said cost ï¿¡400 per foot of beach frontage, they rounded Old Fort Point and came upon the gleaming white and dark blue ship lying with two anchors out in deep water just outside the reef. Leiter whistled. He said in an awestruck voice, ?Boy, is that a piece of boat! I\u0027d sure like to have one of those to play with in my bath.? \n \n Bond said, ?She\u0027s Italian. Built by a firm called Rodrigues at Messina. Thing called an Aliscafo . She\u0027s got a hydrofoil under the hull and when she gets going you let this sort of skid down and she rises up and practically flies. Only the screws and a few feet of the stern stay in the water. The Police Commissioner says she can do fifty knots in calm water. Only good for inshore work of course, but they can carry upwards of a hundred passengers when they\u0027re designed as fast ferries. Apparently this one\u0027s been designed for about forty. The rest of the space is taken up with the owner\u0027s quarters and cargo space. Must have cost damned near a quarter of a million.? \n \n The boatman broke in. ?They say on Bay Street that she goin\u0027 go after the treasure these next few days or so. All the people that own share in the gold come in a few days ago. Then she spen\u0027 one whole night doin\u0027 a final recce. They say is down Exhuma way, or over by Watlings Island. Guess you folks know that\u0027s where Columbus make him first landfall on this side of the Atlantic. Around fourteen ninety somethin\u0027. But could be anywhere down there. They\u0027s always been talk of treasure down \u0027mongst the Ragged Islands-even as far as Crooked Island. Fact is she sail out southward. Hear her myself, right until her engines died away. East by southeast, I\u0027da say.? The boatman spat discreetly over the side. ?Must be plenty heap of treasure with the cost of that ship and all the money they throwing \u0027way. Every time she go to the Hoiling Wharf they say the bill\u0027s five hundred pound.? \n \n Bond said casually, ?Which night was it they did the final recce?? \n \n ?Night after she hoiled. That\u0027d be two nights ago. Sail round six.? \n \n The blank portholes of the ship watched them approach. A sailor polishing brass round the curve of the enclosed dome that was the bridge walked through the hatch into the bridge and Bond could see him talking into a mouthpiece. A tall man in white ducks and a very wide mesh singlet appeared on deck and observed them through binoculars. He called something to the sailor, who came and stood at the top of the ladder down the starboard side. When their launch came alongside, the man cupped his hands and called down, ?What is your business, please? Have you an appointment?? \n \n Bond called back, ?It\u0027s Mr. Bond, Mr. James Bond. From New York. I have my attorney here. I have an inquiry to make about Palmyra, Mr. Largo\u0027s property.? \n \n ?One moment, please.? The sailor disappeared and returned accompanied by the man in white ducks and singlet. Bond recognized him from the police description. He called down cheerfully, ?Come aboard, come aboard.? He gestured for the sailor to go down and help fend the launch. Bond and Leiter climbed out of the launch and went up the ladder. \n \n Largo held out a hand. ?My name is Emilio Largo. Mr. Bond?? \n \n And . . .?? \n \n ?Mr. Larkin, my attorney from New York. Actually I\u0027m English, but I have property in America.? They shook hands. ?I\u0027m sorry to bother you, Mr. Largo, but it\u0027s about Palmyra, the property I believe you rent from Mr. Bryce.? \n \n ?Ah, yes, of course.? The beautiful teeth gleamed warmth and welcome. ?Come on down to the stateroom, gentlemen. I\u0027m sorry I am not properly dressed to receive you.? The big brown hands caressed his flanks, the wide mouth turned down in deprecation. ?My visitors usually announce themselves on the ship-to-shore. But if you will forgive the informality . . .? Largo allowed the phrase to die on the air and ushered them through a low hatch and down a few aluminum steps into the main cabin. The rubber-lined hatch hissed to behind him. \n \n It was a fine large cabin paneled in mahogany with a deep wine-Red carpet and comfortable dark blue leather club chairs. The sun shining through the slats of Venetian blinds over the broad square ports added a touch of gay light to an otherwise rather somber and masculine room, its long center table littered with papers and charts, glass-fronted cabinets containing fishing gear and an array of guns and other weapons, and a black rubber underwater diving suit and aqualung suspended, almost like the skeleton in a sorcerer\u0027s den, from a rack in one corner. The air-conditioning made the cabin deliciously cool, and Bond felt his damp shirt slowly freeing itself from his skin. \n \n ?Please take a chair, gentlemen.? Largo carelessly brushed aside the charts and papers on the table as if they were of no importance. ?Cigarettes?? He placed a large silver box between them. ?And now what can I get you to drink?? He went to the loaded sideboard. ?Something cool and not too strong perhaps? A Planter\u0027s Punch? Gin and tonic? Or there are various beers. You must have had a hot journey in that open launch. I would have sent my boat for you if only I had known.? \n \n They both asked for a plain tonic. Bond said, ?I\u0027m very sorry to barge in like this, Mr. Largo, No idea I could have got you on the telephone. We just got in this morning, and as I\u0027ve only a few days I have to get a move on. The point is, I\u0027m looking for a property down here.? \n \n ?Oh, yes?? Largo brought the glasses and bottles of tonic to the table and sat down so that they formed a comfortable group. ?What a good idea. Wonderful place. I\u0027ve been here f9r six months and already I\u0027d like to stay forever. But the prices they\u0027re asking-? Largo threw up his hands. ?These Bay Street pirates. And the millionaires, they are even worse. But you are wise to come at the end of the season. Perhaps some of the owners are disappointed not to have sold. Perhaps they will not open their mouths so wide.? \n \n ?That\u0027s what I thought.? Bond sat comfortably back and lit a cigarette. ?Or rather what my lawyer, Mr. Larkin, advised.? Leiter shook his head pessimistically. ?He had made some inquiries and he frankly advised that real-estate values down here have gone mad.? Bond turned politely toward Leiter to bring him into the conversation. ?Isn\u0027t that so?? \n \n ?Daft, Mr. Largo, quite daft. Worse even than Florida. Out of \n \n this world. I wouldn\u0027t advise any client of mine to invest at these prices.? \n \n ?Quite so.? Largo obviously didn\u0027t want to get drawn too deeply into these matters. ?You mentioned something about Palmyra. Is there anything I can do to help in that respect?? \n \n Bond said, ?I understand you have a lease of the property, Mr. Largo. And there is talk that you may be leaving the house before long. Only gossip, of course. You know what they are in these small islands. But it sounds more or less what I\u0027m looking for and I gather the owner, this Englishman, Bryce, might sell if he got the right price. What I was going to ask you?-Bond looked apologetic-?was whether we might drive out and look the place over. Some time when you weren\u0027t there of course. Any time that might suit you.? \n \n Largo flashed his teeth warmly. He spread his hands. ?But of course, of course, my dear fellow. Whenever you wish. There is no one in residence but my niece and a few servants. And she is out most of the time. Please just call her up on the telephone. I shall tell her that you will be doing so. It is indeed a charming property-so imaginative. A beautiful piece of design. If only all rich men had such good taste.? \n \n Bond got to his feet and Leiter followed suit. ?Well, that\u0027s extraordinarily kind of you, Mr. Largo. And now we\u0027ll leave you in peace. Perhaps we may meet again in the town some time. You must come and have lunch. But?-Bond poured admiration and flattery into his voice-?with a yacht like this, I don\u0027t suppose you ever want to come ashore. Must be the only one on this side of the Atlantic. Didn\u0027t one used to run between Venice and Trieste? I seem to remember reading about it somewhere.? \n \n Largo grinned his pleasure. ?Yes, that is right, quite right. They are also on the Italian lakes. For passenger traffic. Now they are buying them in South America. A wonderful design for coastal waters. She only draws four feet when the hydrofoil is operating.? \n \n ?I suppose accommodation\u0027s the problem?? \n \n It is a weakness of all men, though not necessarily of all women, to love their material possessions. Largo said, with a trace of pricked vanity, ?No, no. I think you will find that it is not so. You can spare five minutes? We are rather crowded at the moment. You have heard no doubt of our treasure hunt?? He looked sharply at them as a man would who expects ridicule. ?But we will not discuss that now. No doubt you do not believe in these things. But my associates in the affair are all on board. With the crew, there are forty of us. You will see that we are not cramped. You would like?? Largo gestured to the door in the rear of the stateroom. \n \n Felix Leiter showed reluctance. ?You know, Mr. Bond, that we have that meeting with Mr. Harold Christie at five o\u0027clock?? \n \n Bond waved the objection aside. ?Mr. Christie is a charming man. \n \n I know he won\u0027t mind if we are a few minutes late. I\u0027d love to see over the ship if you\u0027re sure you can spare the time, Mr. Largo.? Largo said, ?Come. It will not take more than a few minutes. The excellent Mr. Christie is a friend of mine. He will understand.? He went to the door and held it open. \n \n Bond had been expecting the politeness. It would interfere with \n \n Leiter and his apparatus. He said firmly, ?Please go first, Mr. Largo. \n \n You will be able to tell us when to duck our heads.? With more affabilities, Largo led the way. Ships, however modern, are more or less the same-the corridors to port and starboard of the engine room, rows of cabin doors, which \n \n Largo explained were occupied, the large communal bathrooms, the galley, where two cheerful-looking Italians in white smocks laughed at Largo\u0027s jokes.about the food and seemed pleased with the visitors\u0027 interest, the huge engine room where the chief engineer and his mate, Germans it seemed, gave enthusiastic information about the powerful twin Diesels and explained the hydraulics of the hydrofoil depressor -it was all exactly like visiting any other ship and saying the right things to the crew, using the right superlatives to the owner. \n \n The short space of afterdeck was occupied by the little two-seater amphibian, painted dark blue and white to match the yacht, its wings now folded and its engine cowled against the sun, a big jolly-boat to hold about twenty men, and an electric derrick to hoist them in- and outboard. Bond, estimating the ship\u0027s displacement and her freeboard, said casually, ?And the hold? More cabin space?? \n \n ?Just storage. And the fuel tanks, of course. She is an expensive ship to run. We have to carry several tons. The ballast problem is important with these ships. When her bows come up, the fuel shifts aft. We have to have big lateral tanks to correct these things.? Talking fluently and expertly, Largo led them back up the starboard passageway. They were about to pass the radio room when Bond said, ?You said you had ship-to-shore. What else do you carry? The usual Marconi short and long wave, I suppose. Could I have a look? Radio has always fascinated me.? \n \n Largo said politely, ?Some other time, if you don\u0027t mind. I\u0027m keeping the operator full time on met. reports. They\u0027re rather important to us at the moment.? \n \n ?Of course.? \n \n They climbed up into the enclosed dome of the bridge, where Largo briefly explained the controls and led them out on the narrow deck space. ?So there you are,? said Largo. ?The good ship Disco Volante -the Flying Saucer. And she really does fly, I can assure you. I hope you and Mr. Larkin will come for a short cruise one of these days. For the present?-he smiled with a hint of a secret shared- ?as you may have heard, we are rather busy.? \n \n ?Very exciting, this treasure business. Do you think you\u0027ve got a good chance?? \n \n ?We like to think so.? Largo was deprecating. ?I only wish I could tell you more.? He waved an apologetic hand. ?Unfortunately, as they say, my lips are sealed. I hope you will understand.? \n \n ?Yes, of course. You have your shareholders to consider. I only wish I was one so that I could come along. I suppose there\u0027s not room for another investor?? \n \n ?Alas, no. The issue, as they say, is fully subscribed. It would have been very pleasant to have had you with us.? Largo held out a hand. ?Well, I see that Mr. Larkin has been looking anxiously at his watch during our brief tour. We must not keep Mr. Christie waiting any longer. It has been a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Bond. And you, Mr. Larkin.? \n \n With a further exchange of courtesies they went down the ladder to the waiting launch and got under way. There was a last wave from Mr. Largo before he vanished through the hatch to the bridge. \n \n They sat in the stern well away from the boatman. Leiter shook his head. ?Absolutely negative. Reaction around the engine room and the radio room, but that\u0027s normal. It was all normal, damnably normal. What did you make of him and the whole setup?? \n \n ?Same as you-damned normal. He looks what he says he is, and behaves that way. Not much crew about, but the ones we saw were either ordinary crew or wonderful actors. Only two small things stuck me. There was no way down to the hold that I could see, but of course it could have been a manhole under the passage carpet. But then how do you get the stores he talked of down there? And there\u0027s the hell of a lot of space in that hold even if I don\u0027t know much about naval architecture. I\u0027ll do a check with the oiling wharf through the customs people and see just how much fuel he does carry. Then it\u0027s odd that we didn\u0027t see any of these shareholders. It was around three o\u0027clock when we went on board and most of them may have been having siestas. But surely not all nineteen of them. What do they do in their cabins all the time? Another small thing. Did you notice that Largo didn\u0027t smoke and that there was no trace of tobacco smell anywhere in the ship? That\u0027s odd. Around forty men and not one of them is a smoker. If one had anything else to go on one would say that wasn\u0027t coincidence but discipline. The real pros don\u0027t drink or smoke. But I admit it\u0027s a damned long shot. Notice the Decca Navigator and the echo-sounder? Pretty expensive bits of equipment, both of them. Fairly normal on a big yacht, of course, but I\u0027d have expected Largo to point them out when he was showing us the bridge. Rich men are proud of their toys. But that\u0027s only clutching at straws. I\u0027d have said the whole outfit\u0027s as clean as a whistle if it wasn\u0027t for all that missing space we weren\u0027t shown. That talk about fuel and ballast sounded a bit glib to me. What do you think?? \n \n ?Same as you. There\u0027s at least half of that ship we didn\u0027t see. But then again there\u0027s a perfectly good answer to that. He may have got a stack of secret treasure-hunting gear down there he doesn\u0027t want anyone to see. Remember that merchant ship off Gibraltar during the war? The Italian frogmen used it as a base. Big sort of trapdoor affair cut in the hull below the water line. I suppose he hasn\u0027t got something like that?? \n \n Bond looked sharply at Leiter. ?The Olterra . One of the blackest marks against Intelligence during the whole war.? He paused. ?The Disco was anchored in about forty feet of water. Supposing they\u0027d got the bombs buried in the sand below her. Would your Geiger counter have registered?? \n \n ?Doubt it. I\u0027ve got an underwater model and we could go and have a sniff round when it gets dark. But really, James?-Leiter frowned impatiently-?aren\u0027t we getting a bit off beam-seeing burglars under the bed? We\u0027ve got damn-all to go on. Largo\u0027s a powerful-looking piratical sort of chap, probably a bit of a crook where women are concerned. But what the hell have we got against him? Have you put a Trace through on him and on these shareholders and the crew members?? \n \n ?Yes. Put them all on the wire from Government House, Urgent Rates. We should get an answer by this evening. But look here, Felix.? Bond\u0027s voice was stubborn. ?There\u0027s a damned fast ship with a plane and forty men no one knows anything about. There\u0027s not another group or even an individual in the area who looks in the least promising. All right, so the outfit looks all right and its story seems to stand up. But just supposing the whole thing was a phony-a damned good one of course, but then so it ought to be with all that\u0027s at stake. Take another look at the picture. These so-called shareholders all arrive just in time for June third. On that night the Disco goes to sea and stays out till morning. Just supposing she rendezvous\u0027d that plane in shallow water somewhere. Just suppose she picked up the bombs and put them away-in the sand under the ship, if you like. Anyway, somewhere safe and convenient. Just suppose all that and what sort of a picture do you get?? \n \n ?A B picture so far as I\u0027m concerned, James.? Leiter shrugged resignedly. ?But I guess there\u0027s just enough to make it a lead.? He laughed sardonically. ?But I\u0027d rather shoot myself than put it in tonight\u0027s report. If we\u0027re going to make fools of ourselves, we\u0027d better do it well out of sight and sound of our chiefs. So what\u0027s on your mind? What comes next?? \n \n ?While you get our communications going, I\u0027m going to check with the oiling wharf. Then we\u0027ll call up this Domino girl and try and get ourselves asked for a drink and have a quick look at Largo\u0027s shore base-this Palmyra. Then we go to the Casino and look over the whole of Largo\u0027s group. And then?-Bond looked stubbornly at Leiter -?I\u0027m going to borrow a good man from the Police Commission to give me a hand, put on an aqualung, and go out and have a sniff round the Disco with your other Geiger machine.? \n \n Leiter said laconically, ?Destry Rides Again! Well, I\u0027ll go along with that, James. Just for old times\u0027 sake. But don\u0027t go and stub your toe on a sea urchin or anything. I see there are free cha-cha lessons in the ballroom of the Royal Bahamian tomorrow. We\u0027ve got to keep fit for those. I guess there\u0027ll be nothing else in this trip for my memory book.? \n \n Back in the hotel, a dispatch rider from Government House was waiting for Bond. He saluted smartly, handed over an O.H.M.S. envelope, and got Bond\u0027s signed receipt in exchange. It was a cable from the Colonial Office ?Personal to the Governor.? The text was prefixed PROBOND. The cable read: ?YOUR 1107 RECORDS HAVE NOTHING REPEAT NOTHING ON THESE NAMES STOP INFORMATIVELY ALL STATIONS REPORT NEGATIVELY ON OPERATION THUNDERBALL STOP WHAT HAVE you QUERY.? The message was signed ?PRISM,? which meant that M had approved it. \n \n Bond handed the cable to Leiter. \n \n Leiter read it. He said, ?See what I mean? We\u0027re on a bum steer. This is a thumb-twiddler. See you later in the Pineapple Bar for a dry martini that\u0027s half a jumbo olive. I\u0027ll go send a postcard to Washington and asked them to send down a couple of WAVES. We\u0027re going to have time on our hands.? \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1583/47071.html","bookId":1267,"book":{"id":1267,"title":"007ä¹é¹é³å¼¹ Thunderball","description":"ç®ä»ï¼ é­é¬¼åæ¯ä¸ä¸ªä¸çæ§çææç»ç»ï¼ä¸é¨ä»äºæ¯åãæ¢å«ãåç´¢ç­å½éæ§æ¡ä»¶ãææ¥ï¼é­é¬¼åæ¦æªäºç¾å½è¿å¾è±å½çä¸¤æåå­å¼¹ï¼å¹¶åè±å½é¦ç¸åç´¢1äº¿è±éï¼å¦åå°äºä¸å¤©åç¸æ¯è±å½åå¤§åå¸ãè±æ¹ææ¥ä¹ä¸ï¼æ´¾é£007åå¾é­é¬¼åæ»é¨ï¼å¹¶åææå¨ååºç»äºæé¤æ ¸å¼¹å¼çº¿ï¼é»æ­¢äºå¤§ç¾é¾...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/20/09-21-12-54-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1583","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
