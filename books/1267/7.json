{"id":23751,"no":7,"title":"7. Fasten Your Lap-Strap","content":"James Bond scraped the last dregs of yoghurt out of the bottom of the carton that said: ? Goat-milk culture. From our own Goat Farm at Stanway, Glos. The Heart of the Cotswolds. According to an authentic Bulgarian recipe .? He took an Energen roll, sliced it carefully-they are apt to crumble-and reached for the black treacle. He masticated each mouthful thoroughly. Saliva contains ptyalin. Thorough mastication creates ptyalin which helps to convert starches into sugar to supply energy for the body. Ptyalin is an enzyme. Other enzymes are pepsin, found in the stomach, and trypsin and erepsin, found in the intestine. These and other enzymes are chemical substances that break up the food as it passes through the mouth, the stomach, and the digestive tract and help absorb it directly into the blood stream. James Bond now had all these important facts at his fingertips. He couldn\u0027t understand why no one had told him these things before. Since leaving Shrublands ten days before, he had never felt so well in his life. His energy had doubled. Even the paper work he had always found an intolerable drudgery was now almost a pleasure. He ate it up. Sections, after a period of being only surprised, were now becoming slightly irritated by the forceful, clear-headed minutes that came shooting back at them from the Double-O Section. Bond awoke so early and so full of beans that he had taken to arriving at his office early and leaving late, much to the irritation of his secretary, the delectable Loelia Ponsonby, who found her own private routines being put seriously out of joint. She also was beginning to show signs of irritation and strain. She had even taken upon herself to have a private word with Miss Moneypenny, M\u0027s private secretary and her best friend in the building. Miss Moneypenny, swallowing her jealousy of Loelia Ponsonby, had been encouraging. ?It\u0027s all right, Lil,? she had said over coffee in the canteen. ?The Old Man was like that for a couple of weeks after he had got back from that damned nature-cure place. It was like working for Gandhi or Schweitzer or someone. Then a couple of bad cases came up and rattled him and one evening he went to Blades-to take his mind off things I suppose-and the next day he felt awful, and looked it, and from then on he\u0027s been all right again. I suppose he got back on the champagne cure or something. It\u0027s really the best for men. It makes them awful, but at least they\u0027re human like that. It\u0027s when they get godlike one can\u0027t stand them.? \\n\\n \\n\\n May, Bond\u0027s elderly Scottish treasure, came in to clear the breakfast things away. Bond had lit up a Duke of Durham, king-size, with filter. The authoritative Consumers union of America rates this cigarette the one with the smallest tar and nicotine content. Bond had transferred to the brand from the fragrant but powerful Morland Balkan mixture with three gold rings round the paper that he had been smoking since his teens. The Dukes tasted of almost nothing, but they were at least better than Vanguards, the new ?tobaccoless? cigarette from America that, despite its health-protecting qualities, filled the room with a faint ?burning leaves? smell that made visitors to his office inquire whether something was on fire somewhere. \\n\\n \\n\\n May was fiddling about with the breakfast things-her signal that she had something to say. Bond looked up from the center news page of The Times . ?Anything on your mind, May?? \\n\\n \\n\\n May\u0027s elderly, severe features were flushed. She said defensively, ?I have that.? She looked straight at Bond. She was holding the yoghurt carton in her hand. She crumpled it in her strong fingers and dropped it among the breakfast things on the tray. ?It\u0027s not my place to say it, Mister James, but ye\u0027re poisoning yersel\u0027.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond said cheerfully, ?I know, May. You\u0027re quite right. But at least I\u0027ve got them down to ten a day.? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?I\u0027m not talking about yer wee bitty smoke. I\u0027m talking \u0027bout this-? May gestured at the tray-?this pap.? The word was spat out with disdain. Having got this off her chest, May gathered steam. ?It\u0027s no recht for a man to be eating bairns\u0027 food and slops and suchlike. Ye needn\u0027t worry that I\u0027ll talk, Mister James, but I\u0027m knowing more about yer life than mebbe ye were wishing I did. There\u0027s been times when they\u0027re brought ye home from hospital and there\u0027s talk you\u0027ve been in a motoring accident or some such. But I\u0027m not the old fule ye think I am, Mister James. Motoring accidents don\u0027t make one small hole in yer shoulder or yer leg or somewhere. Why, ye\u0027ve got scars on ye the noo-ach, ye needn\u0027t grin like that, I\u0027ve seen them-that could only be made by buellets. And these guns and knives and things ye carry around when ye\u0027re off abroad. Ach!? \\n\\n \\n\\n May put her hands on her hips. Her eyes were bright and defiant. ?Ye can tell me to mind my ain business and pack me off back to Glen Orchy, but before I go I\u0027m telling ye, Mister James, that if ye get yerself into anuither fight and ye\u0027ve got nothing but yon muck in yer stomach, they\u0027ll be bringing ye home in a hearse. That\u0027s what they\u0027ll be doing.? \\n\\n \\n\\n In the old days, James Bond would have told May to go to hell and leave him in peace. Now, with infinite patience and good humor, he gave May a quick run through the basic tenets of ?live? as against ?dead? foods. ?You see, May,? he said reasonably, ?all these de-naturized foods-white flour, white sugar, white rice, white salts, whites of egg-these are dead foods. Either they\u0027re dead anyway like whites of egg or they\u0027ve had all the nourishment refined out of them. They\u0027re slow poisons, like fried foods and cakes and coffee and heaven knows how many of the things I used to eat. And anyway, look how wonderfully well I am. I feel absolutely a new man since I took to eating the right things and gave up drink and so on. I sleep twice as well. I\u0027ve got twice as much energy. No headaches. No muscle pains. NO hangovers. Why, a month ago there wasn\u0027t a week went by but that on at least one day I couldn\u0027t eat anything for breakfast but a couple of aspirins and a prairie oyster. And you know quite well that that used to make you cluck and tut-tut all over the place like an old hen. Well?-Bond raised his eyebrows amiably-?what about that?? \\n\\n \\n\\n May was defeated. She picked up the tray and, with a stiff back made for the door. She paused on the threshold and turned round. Her eyes were bright with angry tears. ?Well, all I can say is, Mr. James, that mebbe ye\u0027re right and mebbe ye\u0027re wrong. What worries the life out of me is that ye\u0027re not yersel\u0027 any more.? She went out and banged the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond sighed and picked up the paper. He said the magical words that all men say when a middle-aged woman makes a temperamental scene, ?change of life,? and went back to reading about the latest reasons for not having a Summit meeting. \\n\\n \\n\\n The telephone, the red one that was the direct line with Headquarters, gave its loud, distinctive jangle. Bond kept his eyes on the page and reached out a hand. With the Cold War easing off, it was not like the old days. This would be nothing exciting. Probably canceling his shoot at Bisley that afternoon with the new F.N. rifle. \\n\\n \\n\\n ?Bond speaking.? \\n\\n \\n\\n It was the Chief of Staff. Bond dropped his paper on the floor. He pressed the receiver to his ear, trying, as in the old days, to read behind the words. \\n\\n \\n\\n ?At once please, James. M.? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?Something for me?? \\n\\n \\n\\n ?Something for everyone. Crash dive, and ultra hush. If you\u0027ve got any dates for the next few weeks, better cancel them. You\u0027ll be off tonight. See you.? The line went dead. \\n\\n \\n\\n *** \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond had the most selfish car in England. It was a Mark II Continental Bentley that some rich idiot had married to a telegraph pole on the Great West Road. Bond had bought the bits for ￡1500 and Rolls had straightened the bend in the chassis and fitted new clockwork-the Mark IV engine with 9.5 compression. Then Bond had gone to Mulliners with ￡3000, which was half his total capital, and they had sawn off the old cramped sports saloon body and had fitted a trim, rather square convertible two-seater affair, power-operated, with only two large armed bucket seats in black leather. The rest of the blunt end was all knife-edged, rather ugly, trunk. The car was painted in rough, not gloss, battleship gray and the upholstery was black morocco. She went like a bird and a bomb and Bond loved her more than all the women at present in his life rolled, if that were feasible, together. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Bond refused to be owned by any car. A car, however splendid, was a means of locomotion (he called the Continental ?the locomotive?. . . ?I\u0027ll pick you up in my locomotive?) and it must at all times be ready to locomote-no garage doors to break one\u0027s nails on, no pampering with mechanics except for the quick monthly service. The locomotive slept out of doors in front of his flat and was required to start immediately, in all weathers, and, after that, stay on the road. \\n\\n \\n\\n The twin exhausts-Bond had demanded two-inch pipes; he hadn\u0027t liked the old soft flutter of the marque-growled solidly as the long gray nose topped by a big octagonal silver bolt instead of the winged B, swerved out of the little Chelsea square and into King\u0027s Road. It was nine o\u0027clock, too early for the bad traffic, and Bond pushed the car fast up Sloane Street and into the park. It would also be too early for the traffic police, so he did some fancy driving that brought him to the Marble Arch exit in three minutes flat. Then there came the slow round-the-houses into Baker Street and so into Regents Park. Within ten minutes of getting the Hurry call he was going up in the lift of the big square building to the eighth and top floor. \\n\\n \\n\\n Already, as he strode down the carpeted corridor, he smelled emergency. On this floor, besides M\u0027s offices, was housed Communications, and from behind the gray closed doors there came a steady zing and crackle from the banks of transmitters and a continuous machine-gun rattle and clack from the cipher machines. It crossed Bond\u0027s mind that a General Call was going out. What the hell had happened? \\n\\n \\n\\n The Chief of Staff was standing over Miss Moneypenny. He was handing her signals from a large sheaf and giving her, routing instructions. ?CIA Washington, Personal for Dulles. Cipher Triple X by Teleprinter. Mathis, Deuxième Bureau. Same prefix and route. Station F for Head of NATO Intelligence. Personal. Standard route through Head of Section. This one by Safe Hand to Head of M.I.5, Personal, copy to Commissioner of Police, Personal, and these?-he handed over a thick batch-?Personal to Heads of Stations from M. Cipher Double X by Whitehall Radio and Portishead. All right? Clear them as quick as you can, there\u0027s a good girl. There\u0027ll be more coming. We\u0027re in for a bad day.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Miss Moneypenny smiled cheerfully. She liked what she called the shot-and-shell days. It reminded her of when she had started in the Service as a junior in the Cipher Department. She leaned over and pressed the switch on the intercom, ?007\u0027s here, sir.? She looked up at Bond. ?You\u0027re off.? The Chief of Staff grinned and said, ?Fasten your lap-strap.? The red light went on above M\u0027s door. Bond walked through. \\n\\n \\n\\n Here it was entirely peaceful. M sat relaxed, sideways to his desk looking out of the broad window at the distant glittering fretwork of London\u0027s skyline. He glanced up. ?Sit down, 007. Have a look at these.? He reached out and slid some foolscap-sized photostats across the desk. ?Take your time.? He picked up his pipe and began to fill it, absent-minded fingers dipping into the shell-base tobacco jar at his elbow. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond picked up the top photostat. It showed the front and back of an addressed envelope, dusted for fingerprints, which were all over its surface. \\n\\n \\n\\n M glanced sideways. ?Smoke if you like.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond said, ?Thanks, sir. I\u0027m trying to give it up.? \\n\\n \\n\\n M said, ?Humpf,? put his pipe in his mouth, struck a match, and inhaled a deep lungful of smoke. He settled himself deeper in his chair. The gray sailor\u0027s eyes gazed through the window introspectively, seeing nothing. \\n\\n \\n\\n The envelope, prefixed ?PERSONAL AND MOST IMMEDIATE,? was addressed to the Prime Minister, by name, at No. 10, Downing Street, Whitehall, London, sw1. Every detail of the address was correct down to the final ?P.C.? to denote that the Prime Minister was a Privy Councillor. The punctuation was meticulous. The stamp was postmarked Brighton, 8:30 a.m. on June 3. It crossed Bond\u0027s mind that the letter might therefore have been posted under cover of night and that it would probably have been delivered some time in the early afternoon of the same day, yesterday. A typewriter with a bold, rather elegant type had been used. This fact, together with the generous 5-by-7 ?-inch envelope and the spacing and style of the address, gave a solid, businesslike impression. The back of the envelope showed nothing but fingerprints. There was no sealing wax. \\n\\n \\n\\n The letter, equally correct and well laid out, ran as follows: \\n\\n \\n\\n *** \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr Prime Minister, \\n\\n \\n\\n You should be aware, or you will be if you communicate with the Chief of the Air Staff, that, since approximately 10 p.m. yesterday, 2nd June, a British aircraft carrying two atomic weapons is overdue on a training flight. The aircraft is Villiers Vindicator O/NBR from No. 5 R.A.F. Experimental Squadron based at Boscombe Down. The Ministry of Supply Identification Numbers on the atomic weapons are MOS/bd/654/Mk V. and MOS/ bd/655/Mk V. There are also U.S.A.F. Identification Numbers in such profusion and of such prolixity that I will not weary you with them. \\n\\n \\n\\n This aircraft was on a NATO training flight with a crew or five and one observer. It carried sufficient fuel for ten hours\u0027 flying at 600 m.p.h. at a mean altitude of 40,000 feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n This aircraft, together with the two atomic weapons, is now in the possession of this organization. The crew and the observer are deceased and you have our authority to inform the next-of-kin accordingly, thus assisting you in preserving, on the grounds that the aircraft has crashed, the degree of secrecy you will no doubt wish to maintain and which will be equally agreeable to ourselves. The whereabouts of this aircraft and of the two atomic weapons, rendering them possible of recovery, will be communicated to you in exchange for the equivalent of ￡100,000,000 in gold bullion, one thousand, or not less than nine hundred and ninety-nine, fine. Instructions for the delivery of the gold are contained in the attached memorandum. A further condition is that the recovery and disposal of the gold will not be hampered and that a free pardon, under your personal signature and that of the President of the United States, will be issued in the name of this organization and all its members. \\n\\n \\n\\n Failure to accept these conditions within seven days from 5 p.m. G.M.T. on June 3rd, 1959-i.e. not later than 5 p.m. G.M.T. on June 10th, 1959-will have the following consequences. Immediately after that date a piece of property belonging to the Western Powers, valued at not less than the aforesaid ￡100,000,000, will be destroyed. There will be loss of life. If, within 48 hours after this warning, willingness to accept our terms is still not communicated, there will ensue, without further warning, the destruction of a major city situated in an undesignated country of the world. There will be very great loss of life. Moreover, between the two occurrences, this organization will reserve to itself the right to communicate to the world the 48-hour time limit. This measure, which will cause widespread panic in every major city, will be designed to hasten your hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n This, Mr. Prime Minister, is a single and final communication. We shall await your reply, every hour on the hour G.M.T., on the 16-megacycle waveband. \\n\\n \\n\\n Signed \\n\\n \\n\\n S.P.E.C.T.R.E. \\n\\n \\n\\n (The Special Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion) \\n\\n \\n\\n *** \\n\\n \\n\\n James Bond read through the letter again and put it carefully down on the desk in front of him. He then turned to the second page, a detailed memorandum for the delivery of the gold. ?Northwestern slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily . . . Decca Navigational Aid transmitting on ... Full moon period . . . between midnight and 0100 G.M.T . . . individual quarter-ton consignments packed in one-foot-thick foam rubber . . . minimum of three parachutes per consignment . . . nature of planes and flight schedule to be communicated on the 16-megacycle waveband not later than 24 hours before the operation . . . Any counter-measures initiated will be considered a breach of contract and will result in the detonation of Atomic Weapon No. 1 or No. 2 as the case may be.? The typed signature was the same. Both pages had one last line: ?Copy to the President of the United States of America, by Registered Airmail, posted simultaneously.? \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond laid the photostat quietly down on top of the others. He reached into his hip pocket for the gunmetal cigarette case that now contained only nine cigarettes, took one, and lit it, drawing the smoke deep down into his lungs and letting it out with a long, reflective hiss. \\n\\n \\n\\n M swiveled his chair round so they were facing each other. ?Well?? \\n\\n \\n\\n Bond noticed that M\u0027s eyes, three weeks before so clear and vital, were now bloodshot and strained. No wonder! He said, ?If this plane, and the weapons, really are missing, I think it stands up, sir. I think they mean it. I think it\u0027s a true bill.? \\n\\n \\n\\n M said, ?So does the War Cabinet. So do I.? He paused. ?Yes, the plane with the bombs is missing. And the stock numbers on the bombs are correct. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1583/47065.html","bookId":1267,"book":{"id":1267,"title":"007之霹雳弹 Thunderball","description":"简介： 魔鬼党是一个世界性的恐怖组织，专门从事毒品、抢劫、勒索等国际性案件。某日，魔鬼党拦截了美国运往英国的两枚原子弹，并向英国首相勒索1亿英镑，否则将于七天内炸毁英国各大城市。英方情急之下，派遣007前往魔鬼党总部，并同杜明娜内应终于拆除核弹引线，阻止了大灾难...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201606/20/09-21-12-54-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1583","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:45 AM"}}
