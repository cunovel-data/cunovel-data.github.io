{"id":29994,"no":7,"title":"VáRENKA óLESOFF","content":"I \n \n ... A few days after his appointment as instructor in one of the provincial universities, Ippolít Sergyéevitch Polkánoff received a telegram from his sister, from her estate in a distant forest district on the Vólga. \n \n The telegram briefly announced: \n \n \"My husband is dead. For God\u0027s sake, come at once to my assistance. Elizavéta.\" \n \n This alarming summons unpleasantly agitated Ippolít Sergyéevitch, interfering with his projects and his frame of mind. He had already decided to spend the summer in the country, at the house of one of his comrades, and to do a great deal of work there, in order to prepare himself to do justice to his lectures; and now, here it was necessary to travel more than a thousand versts from St. Petersburg and from the place of his appointment, in order to comfort a woman who had lost her husband, with whom, judging from her own letters, her life had been far from sweet. \n \n He had seen his sister, for the last time, four years previously, had corresponded with her rarely, and dong ago there had been established between them those purely formal relations which are so common between two relatives who are separated by distance, and by dissimilarity of their life-interests. \n \n The telegram evoked in him the memory of his sister\u0027s[Pg 324] husband. The latter was a stout, good-natured man, fond of eating and drinking. His face was round, covered with a network of red veins, and his eyes were merry and small; he had a way of roguishly screwing up his left eye, and smiling sweetly, as he sang in atrocious French: \n \n \"Regardez par ci, regardez par là....\" \n \n And Ippolít Sergyéevitch found it difficult to believe, that that jolly young fellow was dead, because common-place people usually live a long time. \n \n His sister had borne herself toward the weaknesses of this man with a half-scornful condescension; being anything but a stupid woman, she had comprehended, that if you shoot at a stone, you merely lose your arrows. And it was not likely that she was greatly afflicted by his death. \n \n But, nevertheless, it was not easy to refuse her request. He could work at her house quite as well as anywhere else.... \n \n After further meditation in this direction, Ippolít Sergyéevitch decided to go, and, a couple of weeks later, on a warm June evening, fatigued with a journey of forty versts[1] by posting-wagon, from the wharf to the village, he was seated at the table opposite his sister, on a terrace which overlooked the park, drinking exquisite tea. \n \n Along the balustrade of the terrace, lilac and acacia bushes grew luxuriantly; the slanting rays of the sun, penetrating through the foliage, quivered in the air, in slender, golden ribbons. A tracery of shadows lay upon the table, closely set with country viands; the air was filled with the fragrance of the lindens, the lilacs, and the damp earth, heated by the sun. In the park birds were chirping[Pg 325] noisily; now and then a bee or a wasp flew to the terrace and buzzed anxiously, as it hovered about the table. Elizavéta Sergyéevna took a napkin in her hand, and flourished it in the air, in vexation, chasing the bees and the wasps off into the park. \n \n [1] A verst is two-thirds of a mile.—Translator. \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch had already succeeded in convincing himself that his sister had not been particularly shocked by the fact of her husband\u0027s death, that she was gazing at him, her brother, in a searching way, and as she chatted with him, was concealing something from him. He had become accustomed to think of her, as a woman entirely engrossed in the cares of housekeeping, broken down with the disorders of her wedded life, and he had expected to behold her nervous, pale and exhausted. But now, as he looked at her oval face, covered with healthy sunburn, calm, confident, and extremely enlivened by the intelligent gleam of her large, bright eyes, he felt that he was pleasantly disappointed; and as he lent an ear to her remarks, he tried to hear the undercurrent, and to understand what it was she was withholding from him. \n \n \"I was prepared for this,—\" she said, in a high, calm contralto, and her voice vibrated charmingly on the upper notes.—\"After his second shock, he complained almost daily of pains in the heart, of its irregular beating, of insomnia ... but, nevertheless, when they brought him home from the fields—I could scarcely stand on my feet.... They tell me that he got very excited out there, and shouted...? and on the day before he had been to visit ólesoff—a landed proprietor, a retired colonel, a drunkard and a cynic, broken down with the gout. By the way, he has a daughter—there\u0027s a treasure, I can tell you I—You must make her acquaintance....\" \n \n [Pg 326] \n \n \"If it cannot be avoided,\" interposed Ippolít Sergyéevitch, glancing at his sister with a smile. \n \n \"It cannot! She is often at our house ... but now, of course, she will come here more frequently than ever,—\" she replied to him, with a smile also. \n \n \"Is she on the lookout for a husband? I\u0027m not fitted for the part.\" \n \n His sister looked him steadily in the face, which was oval, thin, with small, pointed, black beard, and a lofty, white brow. \n \n \"Why are you not fitted for the part? Of course, I am speaking in general, without any idea in connection with Miss ólesoff,—you will understand why when you see her ... but, surely, you are thinking of marrying?\" \n \n \"Not just yet,—\" he answered her briefly, raising from his glass his light-gray eyes with a cold gleam. \n \n \"Yes,—\" said Elizavéta Sergyéevna thoughtfully,—\"at the age of thirty it is both late and early, for a man to take that step....\" \n \n It pleased him that she had ceased to speak of her husband\u0027s death, but why had she summoned him to her so loudly and in so frightened a manner? \n \n \"A man should marry at twenty or at forty,\" she said pensively,—\"in that way, there is less risk of deceiving oneself or of deceiving another person ... but if you do make a mistake, then, in the first case, you pay for it with the freshness of your feelings, and in the second ... at least by your outward position, which is almost always solid in the case of a man of forty.\" \n \n It struck him that she was saying this more for herself than for him, and he did not interrupt her, but leaned back in his arm-chair and deeply inhaled the aromatic air. \n \n [Pg 327] \n \n \"As I was saying—he had been at ólesoff\u0027s on the day before, and, of course, he drank there. Well, and so....\" Elizavéta Sergyéevna shook her head sadly.—\"Now ... I am left alone ... although, after the second year of my life with him, I felt myself inwardly quite alone. But now my position is so strange! I am twenty-eight years old, I have not lived, I have merely been attached to the service of my husband and children,... the children are dead. And I ... what am I now? What am I to do, and how am I to live? I would sell this estate, and go abroad, but his brother lays claim to the inheritance, and there may be a lawsuit. I will not give up what belongs to me, without legal grounds for so doing, and I see none in the claim of his brother. What do you think about it?...\" \n \n \"I am not a lawyer, you know,—\" laughed Ippolít Sergyéevitch.—\"But ... tell me all about this, and we shall see. That brother—has he written to you?\" \n \n \"Yes ... and quite roughly. He is a gambler, a ruined man, who has sunk very low ... my husband did not like him, although they had much in common.\" \n \n \"We shall see!—\" said Ippolít Sergyéevitch, and rubbed his hands with satisfaction. He was delighted to know why his sister needed him, he did not like anything that was not clear and definite. His first care was the preservation of his inward equanimity, and if anything obscure perturbed that equanimity,—a troubled disquietude and irritation arose in his soul, which anxiously incited him to clear up the thing he did not understand as promptly as possible. \n \n \"To speak frankly,\"—explained Elizavéta softly, and without looking at her brother,—\"this stupid claim has[Pg 328] alarmed me. I am so worn out, Ippolít, I do so want to rest ... and here, something is beginning again.\" \n \n She sighed heavily, and taking his glass, she continued in a melancholy tone, which tickled her brother\u0027s ears unpleasantly: \n \n \"Eight years of life with such a man as my deceased husband give me the right, I think, to a rest. Any other woman in my place,—a woman with a less developed sense of duty and respectability—would long ago have broken that heavy chain, but I wore it, although I fainted under its weight. But the death of my children—ah, Ippolít, if you only knew what I endured when I lost them!\" \n \n He looked into her face with an expression of sympathy, but her plaints did not touch his soul. He did not like her language, a bookish sort of language, which was not natural to a person who feels deeply, and her bright eyes flitted strangely from side to side, rarely coming to a pause on anything. Her gestures were soft, and cautious, and an inward chill breathed forth from her whole finely-formed figure. \n \n Some sort of a merry bird perched on the balustrade of the terrace, twittering, hopped along it, and flew away. The brother and sister followed it with their eyes, as they sat a few seconds in silence. \n \n \"Does anyone come to see you? Do you read?\"—asked the brother, as he lighted a cigarette, thinking how delightful it would be to sit in silence, on that magnificent quiet evening, in a comfortable easy-chair, there on the terrace, listening to the quiet rustling of the foliage and waiting for the night, which would come, and extinguish the sounds, and light up the stars. \n \n \"Várenka comes, and once in a while, Mrs. Banártzeff ... do you remember her? Liudmila Vasílievna ...[Pg 329] she, also, is not happy with her husband.. but she understands how to avoid taking offence. A great many men used to come to see my husband,—but not a single one of them was interesting! Decidedly, there is not a soul with whom to exchange a word ... agriculture, hunting, county tittle-tattle, gossip—that is all they talk about.... However, there is one ... a bachelor of law—Benkóvsky ... young, and very highly educated. You remember the Benkóvskys? Wait! I think someone is coming.\" \n \n \"Who is coming ... that Benkóvsky?\"—inquired Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n For some reason, his query set his sister to laughing; as she laughed, she rose from her chair, and said in a voice that was new to him: \n \n \"Várenka!\" \n \n \"Ah!\" \n \n \"Let us see what you will say about her.... Here she has made the conquest of everybody. But what a monster she is, from a spiritual point of view! How-ever—you shall see for yourself.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t care about it,\" he declared indifferently, stretching himself out in his arm-chair. \n \n \"I will be back directly,\"—said Elizavéta Sergyéevna, as she went away. \n \n \"But she will present herself without your help,\" he said with concern. \n \n \"Yes, I\u0027ll be back directly!\" his sister called to him from the room. \n \n He frowned, and remained in his chair, gazing into the park. The swift beat of a horse\u0027s hoofs became audible, and the rumble of wheels on the ground. \n \n Before Ippolít Sergyéevitch\u0027s eyes stood rows of aged,[Pg 330] gnarled linden trees, maples, and oaks, enveloped in the evening twilight. Their angular branches were interwoven one with another, forming overhead a thick roof of fragrant verdure, and all of them, decrepit with time, with rifted bark and broken boughs, seemed to form a living and friendly family of beings, closely united in an aspiration upward, toward the light. But their bark was thickly covered with a yellow efflorescence of mould, at their roots young trees had sprung up luxuriantly, and from this cause, on the old trees there were many dead branches, which swung in the air like lifeless skeletons. \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch gazed at them, and felt an inclination to doze off there in his arm-chair, under the breath of the ancient park. \n \n Between the trunks and boughs gleamed crimson patches of the horizon, and against this vivid background, the trees seemed still more gloomy, and wasted away. Along the avenue, which ran from the terrace into the dusky distance, the thick shadows were slowly moving, and the stillness increased every minute, inspiring confused fancies. Ippolít Sergyéevitch\u0027 imagination, yielding to the sorcery of the evening, depicted from the shadows the silhouette of a woman whom he knew, and his own by her side. They walked in silence down the avenue, into the distance, she pressed closely to him, and he felt the warmth of her body. \n \n \"How do you do!\"—rang out a thick chest voice. \n \n He sprang to his feet, and looked round, somewhat disconcerted. \n \n Before him stood a young girl, of medium stature, in a gray gown, over her head was thrown something white and airy, like a bridal veil,—that was all he noticed in that first moment. \n \n [Pg 331] \n \n She offered him her hand, inquiring: \n \n \"Ippolít Sergyéevitch, is it not? Miss ólesoff.... I already knew that you were to arrive to-day, and came to see what you were like. I have never seen any learned men,—and I did not know what they might be like.\" \n \n A strong, warm, little hand pressed his hand, and he, somewhat abashed by this unexpected attack, bowed to her in silence, was angry at himself for his confusion, and thought that, when he should look at her face, he would find there frank and coarse coquetry. But when he did look at it, he beheld large, dark eyes, which were smiling artlessly and caressingly, illuminating the handsome face. Ippolít Sergyéevitch remembered that he had seen just that sort of a face, proud with healthy beauty, in an old Italian picture. The same little mouth with splendid lips, the same brow, arched and lofty, and the huge eyes beneath it. \n \n \"Permit me ... I will order some lights ... pray be seated....\" he requested her. \n \n \"Don\u0027t trouble yourself, I am quite at home here,\" she said, seating herself in his chair.... \n \n He stood at the table facing her, and gazed at her, feeling that this was awkward, and that it behooved him to speak. But she, not in the least confused by his steady gaze, spoke herself. She asked him how he had come, whether he liked the country, whether he would remain there long; he answered her in monosyllables, and various fragmentary thoughts flashed through his mind. He was stunned, as it were, by a blow, and his brain, always clear, now grew turbid in the presence of feelings suddenly and chaotically aroused by force. His enchantment with her struggled with irritation at himself, and curiosity struggled with something that was akin to fear.[Pg 332] But this young girl, blooming with health, sat opposite him, leaning against the back of her chair, closely enveloped in the material of her costume, which permitted a glimpse of the magnificent outlines of her shoulders, bosom and torso, and in a melodious voice full of masterful notes, uttered to him some trivialities, such as are usual when two unacquainted persons meet for the first time. Her dark chestnut hair curled charmingly, and her eyebrows and eyes were darker than her hair. On her dark neck, around her rosy, transparent ear, the skin quivered, announcing the swift circulation of the blood in her veins, a dimple made its appearance every time a smile disclosed her small, white teeth, and every fold of her garments breathed forth an exasperating seduction. There was something rapacious in the arch of her nose, and in her small teeth, which shone forth from between ripe lips, and her attitude, full of unstudied charm, reminded one of the grace of well-fed and petted kittens. \n \n It seemed to Ippolít Sergyéevitch that he had become two persons: one half of his being was absorbed in this sensual beauty, and was slavishly contemplating it, the second half was mechanically noting the existence of the first, and feeling that it had lost its power over it. He replied to the girl\u0027s questions, and put some questions to her himself, not being in a condition to tear his eyes from her entrancing figure. He had already called her, to himself, a luxurious female, and had inwardly laughed at himself, but this did not annihilate his double existence. Thus it went on, until his sister made her appearance on the terrace, with the exclamation: \n \n \"See what a clever creature! I was hunting for her yonder, and she is already....\" \n \n \"I went round by the park.\" \n \n [Pg 333] \n \n \"Have you made each other\u0027s acquaintance?\" \n \n \"Oh, yes! I thought that Ippolít Sergyéevitch was bald, at least!\" \n \n \"Shall I pour you some tea?\" \n \n \"Please do.\" \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch withdrew a little apart from them, and stood near the steps which led down into the park. He passed his hand over his face, and then drew his fingers across his eyes, as though he were wiping the dust from his face and eyes. He was ashamed of himself for having yielded to a burst of emotion, and this shame soon gave way to irritation against the young girl. To himself, he characterized the scene with her as a Kazák attack on a prospective husband, and he felt like announcing himself to her as a man who was utterly indifferent to her challenging beauty. \n \n \"I\u0027m going to stay over night with you, and spend all day to-morrow here....\" she said to his sister. \n \n \"And how about Vasíly Stepánovitch?\" asked his sister, in surprise. \n \n \"Aunt Lutchítzky is visiting us, she will look after him.... You know, that papa is very fond of her.\" \n \n \"Excuse me,...\" said Ippolít Sergyéevitch drily,—\"I am extremely fatigued, and will go and rest....\" \n \n He bowed and departed, and Várenka\u0027s exclamation of approbation followed him: \n \n \"You ought to have done so long ago!\" \n \n In the tone of her exclamation he detected only good nature, but he set it down as an attempt to ingratiate herself, and as false. \n \n The room which had served his sister\u0027s husband as a study had been prepared for him. In the middle of it stood a heavy, awkward writing-table, before which was[Pg 334] an oaken arm-chair; along one of the walls, almost for its entire length, stretched a broad, ragged Turkish divan, on the other, a harmonium, and two book-cases. Several large, soft chairs, a small smoking table beside the divan, and a chess-table at the window, completed the furniture of the room. The ceiling was low and blackened with smoke. From the walls dark spots, which were pictures and engravings of some sort, in coarse, gilded frames, peered forth—everything was heavy, old, and emitted a disagreeable odor. On the table stood a large lamp with a blue shade, and the light from it fell upon the floor. \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch halted at the edge of this circle of light, and feeling a sensation of confused trepidation, glanced at the windows of the room. There were two of them, and outside, in the gloom of evening the dark silhouettes of the trees were outlined. He went to the windows, and opened both of them. Then the room was filled with the fragrance of the blossoming lindens, and with it floated in a burst of hearty laughter in a chest voice. \n \n On the divan a bed had been made up for him, and it occupied a little more than half of the divan. He glanced at it, and began to undo his necktie; but then, with an abrupt movement, he pushed an arm-chair to the window, and seated himself in it, with a scowl. \n \n This sensation of incomprehensible trepidation disquieted his mind, and irritated him. The feeling of dissatisfaction with himself rarely presented itself to him, but when it did, it never seized hold upon him powerfully, or for long—he managed to get rid of it promptly. He was convinced that a man should and can understand his emotions, and develop or suppress them; and when people[Pg 335] talked to him about the mysterious complication of man\u0027s psychical life, he grinned ironically, and called such opinions metaphysics. It was all the worse for him now to feel that he was entering the sphere of some incomprehensible emotions or other. \n \n He asked himself: Is it possible that the meeting with this healthy and handsome young girl—who must be extremely sensual and stupid,—was it possible that this meeting could have such a strange influence upon him? And after having carefully scrutinized the series of impressions of that day, he was compelled to answer himself in the affirmative. Yes, it was so because she had taken his mind unawares, because he was extremely fatigued with the journey, and had been in a dreamy mood which was quite unusual for him at the moment when she made her appearance before him. \n \n This reflection somewhat soothed him, and she immediately presented herself to his eyes in her splendid, maidenly beauty. He contemplated her, closing his eyes and nervously inhaling the smoke of his cigarette, but as he contemplated her, he criticised. \n \n \"In reality,\"—he reflected,—\"she is vulgar: there is too much blood and muscle in her healthy body, and there are too few nerves. Her ingenuous face is not intelligent, and the pride which beams in the frank gaze of her deep, dark eyes is the pride of a woman who is convinced of her beauty, and is spoiled by the admiration of men. My sister said that this Várenka makes a conquest of everybody.\"—Of course, she was trying to make a conquest of him, also. But he had come hither to work, and not to frolic, and she would soon understand that. \n \n \"But am not I thinking a great deal about her, for a first encounter?\"—flashed through his mind. \n \n [Pg 336] \n \n The disk of the moon, huge and blood-red in hue, was rising somewhere, far away behind the trees of the park: it gazed forth from the darkness like the eye of a monster, born of it. Faint sounds, coming from the direction of the village, were borne upon the air.... Now and then, in the grass beneath the window, a rustling resounded; it must be a tortoise or a hedgehog on the prowl. A nightingale was singing somewhere. And the moon mounted slowly in the sky, as though the fateful necessity of its movement was understood by it and wearied it. Flinging his cigarette, which had gone out, from the window, Ippolít Sergyéevitch rose, undressed, and extinguished the lamp. Then the darkness poured into the room from the garden, the trees moved up to the windows, as though desirous of looking in; on the floor lay two streaks of moonlight, still faint and turbid. \n \n The springs of the divan creaked shrilly under the body of Ippolít Sergyéevitch, and overcome by the pleasant coolness of the linen sheets, he stretched himself out, and lay still on his back. Soon he was dozing, and under his window he heard someone\u0027s cautious footsteps and a thick whisper: \n \n \"... Má-arya ... Are you there? Hey?\" ... \n \n With a smile, he fell fast asleep. \n \n And in the morning, when he awoke in the brilliant sunlight, which filled his room, he smiled again at the memory of the preceding evening, and of the young girl. He presented himself at tea carefully dressed, cold and serious, as was befitting a learned man; but when he saw that his sister was seated alone at the table, he involuntarily burst out: \n \n \"But where is....\" \n \n His sister\u0027s sly smile stopped him before he had finished[Pg 337] his question, and he seated himself, in silence, at the table. Elizavéta Sergyéevna scrutinized his costume in detail, smiling all the while, and paying no heed to his involuntary scowl. Her significant smile enraged him. \n \n \"She rose long ago, and she and I have been to bathe, and she must be in the park now ... and will soon make her appearance,—\" explained Elizavéta Sergyéevna. \n \n \"How circumstantial you are,—\" he said, with a laugh.—\"Please give orders to have my things unloaded immediately after tea.\" \n \n \"And have them taken out?\" \n \n \"No, no, that\u0027s not necessary, I\u0027ll do that myself, otherwise everything will get mixed up.... There are books and candy for you....\" \n \n \"Thanks! That\u0027s nice of you ... and here comes Várenka!\" \n \n She made her appearance in the doorway, in a thin, white gown, which fell from her shoulders to her feet in rich folds. Her costume resembled a child\u0027s blouse, and in it she looked like a child. Pausing for a second at the door, she asked: \n \n \"Have you been waiting for me?—\" and approached the table as noiselessly as a cloud. \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch bowed to her in silence, and as he shook her hand, her arm being bared to the elbow, he perceived a delicate odor of violets which emanated from her. \n \n \"How you have scented yourself!\" exclaimed Elizavéta Sergyéevna. \n \n \"Is it any more than I always do? You are fond of perfumes, Ippolít Sergyéevitch? I am—awfully! When the violets are in bloom, I pluck them every morning after my bath, and rub them in my hands,—I learned that in the pro-gymnasium.... Do you like violets?\" \n \n [Pg 338] \n \n He drank his tea, and did not glance at her, but he felt her eyes on his face. \n \n \"I really have never thought about it—whether I like them or not,—\" he said drily, shrugging his shoulders, but as he involuntarily glanced at her, he smiled. \n \n Shaded by the snow-white material of her gown, her face flamed with a magnificent flush, and her deep eyes beamed with clear joy. She breathed forth health, freshness, unconscious happiness. She was as good as a bright May morning in the north. \n \n \"You haven\u0027t thought about it?\"—she exclaimed.—\"But how is that ... seeing that you are a botanist.\" \n \n \"But not a floriculturist,—\" he explained briefly, and involuntarily reflecting that this might be rude, he turned his eyes away from her face. \n \n \"But are not botany and floriculture one and the same?—\" she inquired, after a pause. \n \n His sister laughed unrestrainedly. And he suddenly became conscious that this laugh made him writhe, for some reason, and he exclaimed pityingly to himself: \n \n \"Yes, she is stupid!\" \n \n But later on, as he explained to her the difference between botany and floriculture, he softened his verdict, and pronounced her merely ignorant. As she listened to his intelligent and serious remarks, she gazed at him with the eyes of an attentive pupil, and this pleased him. As he talked, he often turned his eyes from her face to his sister\u0027s, and in her gaze, which was immovably fixed on Várenka\u0027s face, he discerned eager envy. This interfered with the speech, as it called forth in him a sentiment allied to disdain for his sister. \n \n \"Ye-es,—\" said the young girl slowly,—\"so that\u0027s how it is! And is botany an interesting science?\" \n \n [Pg 339] \n \n \"Hm! you see, one must look upon science from the point of view of its utility to men,—\" he explained, with a sigh. Her lack of development, allied with her beauty, increased his compassion for her. But she, meditatively tapping the edge of her cup with her teaspoon, asked him: \n \n \"Of what utility can it be, that you know how burdock grows? \n \n \"The same which we deduce from studying the phenomena of life in any one man.\" \n \n \"A man and a burdock....\" she smiled. \"Does one man live like all the rest?\" \n \n He found it strange that this uninteresting conversation did not fatigue him. \n \n \"Do I eat and drink in the same way as the peasants?\" she continued seriously, contracting her brows. \"And do many people live as I do?\" \n \n \"How do you live?\"—he inquired, foreseeing that this question would change the course of the conversation. He wished to do so, because a malicious, sneering element had now been added to the envy in the gaze which his sister had fastened upon Várenka. \n \n \"How do I live?—\" the girl suddenly flushed up.—\"Well!—\" And she even closed her eyes with satisfaction. \"You know, I wake up in the morning, and if the day is bright, I immediately feel dreadfully gay! It is as though I had received a costly and beautiful gift, which I had long been wanting to possess.... I run and take my bath—we have a river with springs—the water is cold, and it fairly nips the body! There are very deep spots, and I plunge straight into them, head first, from the bank—splash! It fairly bums one, all over.. you fly into the water as from a precipice, and there is a ringing in your head.... You come to the surface,[Pg 340] tear yourself out of the water, and the sun looks down at you and laughs! Then I go home through the forest, I gather flowers, I inhale the forest air until I am intoxicated; when I arrive, tea is ready! I drink tea, and before me stand flowers.. and the sun gazes at me.... Ah, if you only knew how I love the sun! Then the day advances, and housekeeping cares begin.. everyone loves me at home, they all understand and obey at once,—and everything whirls on like a wheel until the evening .. then the sun sets, the moon and the stars make their appearance ... how beautiful and how new this always is! you understand! I cannot say it intelligibly.. why it is so good to live!... But perhaps you feel just the same yourself, do you? Surely, you understand why such a life is good and interesting?\" \n \n \"Yes ... of course!—\" he assented, ready to wipe the venomous smile from his sister\u0027s face with his hand. \n \n He looked at Várenka, and did not restrain himself from admiring her, as she quivered with the desire to impart to him the strength of the exultation which filled her being, but this ecstasy of hers heightened his feeling of pity for her to the degree of a painfully-poignant sensation. He beheld before him a being permeated with the charm of vegetable life, full of rough poetry, overwhelmingly beautiful, but not ennobled by brains. \n \n \"And in the winter? Are you fond of winter? It is all white, healthy, stimulating, it challenges you to contend with it....\" \n \n A sharp ring of the bell interrupted her speech. Elizavéta Sergyéevna had rung, and when a tall maid, with a round, kind face, and roguish eyes, flew into the room, she said to her, in a weary voice: \n \n \"Clear away the dishes, Másha!\" \n \n [Pg 341] \n \n Then she began to walk up and down the room, in a preoccupied way, shuffling her feet. \n \n All this somewhat sobered the enthusiastic young girl; she twitched her shoulders as though she were shaking something from them, and rather abashed she asked Ippolít Sergyéevitch: \n \n \"Have I bored you with my stupid tales?\" \n \n \"Come, how can you say so?\"—he protested. \n \n \"No, seriously,—I have made myself appear stupid to you?\"—she persisted. \n \n \"But why?!\"—exclaimed Ippolít Sergyéevitch and was surprised that he had said it so warmly and sincerely. \n \n \"I am wild ... that is to say, I am not cultivated ...\" she said apologetically.—\"But I am very glad to talk with you ... because you are a learned man, and so ... unlike what I imagined you to be.\" \n \n \"And what did you imagine me to be like?\"—he queried, with a smile. \n \n \"I thought you would always be talking about various wise things ... why, and how, and this is not so, but this other way, and everybody is stupid, and I alone am wise.... Papa had a friend visiting him, he was a colonel too, like papa, and he was learned, like you ... But he was a military learned man ... what do you call it ... of the General Staff...? and he was frightfully puffed up ... in my opinion, he did not even know anything, but simply bragged....\" \n \n \"And you imagined that I was like that?\"—enquired Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n She was disconcerted, blushed, and springing from her chair, she ran about the room in an absurd way, saying in confusion: \n \n \"Akh, how can you think so ... now, could I....\" \n \n [Pg 342] \n \n \"Well, see here, my dear children....\" remarked Elizavéta Sergyéevna, scanning them with her eyes screwed up,—\"I\u0027m going off to attend to something about the housekeeping, and I leave you ... to the will of God!\" \n \n And she vanished, with a laugh, rustling her skirts as she went. Ippolít Sergyéevitch looked after her reproachfully, and reflected, that he must have a talk with her about her way of behaving toward this really very charming, though undeveloped young girl. \n \n \"Do you know, I have an idea—would you like to go in the boat? We will drive to the forest, and then have a stroll there, and be back by dinner-time. Shall we? I\u0027m awfully glad that the day is so bright, and that I\u0027m not at home.... For papa has another attack of gout, and I should have been obliged to fuss about him. And papa is capricious when he is ill.\" \n \n Amazed at her frank egotism, he did not immediately reply to her in the affirmative, and when he did reply, he recalled the intention, which had arisen in him the evening before, and with which he had emerged from his chamber that morning. But, surely, she had afforded no ground, so far, for suspicion of a desire to conquer his heart? In her speeches, everything was perceptible except coquetry. And, in conclusion, why not spend one day with such ... an undoubtedly original young girl? \n \n \"And do you know how to row? Never mind if you do it badly.... I will do it myself, I am strong. And the boat is so light. Shall we go?\" \n \n They went out upon the terrace, and descended into the park. By the side of his tall, thin figure, she appeared shorter and more plump. He offered her his arm, but she declined it. \n \n [Pg 343] \n \n \"Why? It is nice when one is tired, but otherwise, it only hinders one in walking.\" \n \n He smiled as he looked at her through his eyeglasses, and walked on, adjusting his stride to her pace, which greatly pleased him. Her walk was light and graceful,—her white gown floated around her form, but not a single fold undulated. In one hand she held a parasol, with the other she gesticulated freely and gracefully, as she told him about the beauty of the suburbs of the village. \n \n Her arm, hared to the elbow, was strong and brown, covered with a golden down, and as it moved through the air, it compelled Ippolít Sergyéevitch\u0027s eyes to follow it attentively.... And again, in the dark depths of his soul, a confused, incomprehensible apprehension of something began to tremble. He tried to annihilate it, asking himself: What had prompted him to follow this young girl? And he answered himself:—curiosity, a calm and pure desire to contemplate her beauty. \n \n \"Yonder is the river! Go and take your seat in the boat, and I will get the oars at once....\" \n \n And she disappeared among the trees before he could ask her to show him where he could find the oars. \n \n In the still, cold water of the river, the trees were reflected upside down; he seated himself in the boat, and gazed at them. These spectral images were more splendid and beautiful than the living trees, which stood on the bank, shading the water with their curved and gnarled branches. Their reflection flattered them, thrusting into the background what was deformed, and creating in the water a clear and harmonious fantasy, on the foundation of the paltry reality, disfigured by time. \n \n As he admired the transparent picture, surrounded by the silence and the gleam of the sun which was not yet[Pg 344] hot, and drank in along with the air the songs of the larks full of the joy of existence, Ippolít Sergyéevitch felt springing into life within him a sensation of repose which was novel and agreeable to him, which caressed his brain, and lulled to sleep its constant and rebellious striving to understand and to explain. Quiet peace reigned around, not a leaf quivered on the trees, and in this peace the mute triumph of nature was unceasingly in progress, life, always smitten with death but invincible, was being soundlessly created, and death was working quietly, smiting all things, but never winning the victory. And the blue sky shone in triumphant beauty. \n \n In the background of the picture in the water of the river, a white beauty, with a smile on her face, made her appearance. She stood there, with the oars in her hands, as though inviting him to go to her, mute, very lovely, and she seemed to have dropped down from the sky. \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch knew that it was Várenka, emerging from the park, and that she was looking at him, but he did not wish to destroy the enchantment by a sound or a movement. \n \n \"Say, what a dreamer you are!—\" her astonished exclamation rang out on the air. \n \n Then, with regret, he turned away from the water, glanced at the girl, who was descending vivaciously and easily to the shore, down the steep path from the park. \n \n And his regret vanished with this glance at her, for this girl was, in reality, enchantingly beautiful. \n \n \"I could not possibly have imagined that you were fond of dreaming! You have such a stem, serious face.. You will steer: is that right? We will row upstream.. it is more beautiful there ... and, in general, it is more interesting to go against the current, because then you row, you get exercise, you feel yourself....\" \n \n [Pg 345] \n \n The boat, pushed out from the shore, rocked lazily on the sleepy water, but a powerful stroke of the oars immediately put it alongside of the bank, and rolling from side to side under a second stroke, it glided lightly forward. \n \n \"We will row under the hilly shore, because it is shady there..\" said the young girl, as she cut the water with skilful strokes. \"Only, the current is weak here,... but on the Dnyépr,—Aunt Lutchítzky has an estate there—it\u0027s a terror, I can tell you! It fairly tears the oars out of your hands ... you haven\u0027t seen the rapids of the Dnyépr?...\" \n \n \"Only the threshold of the door,\"[2] Ippolít Sergyéevitch tried to pun. \n \n [2] Poróg, a threshold,—porogt, rapide, in Russian.—Translator. \n \n \"I have been through them,\" she said, laughing.—\"It was fine! One day, they came near smashing the boat, and in that case, we should infallibly have been drowned....\" \n \n \"Well, that would not have been fine at all,\" said Ippolít Sergyéevitch seriously. \n \n \"What of that? I\u0027m not in the least afraid of death ... although I love to live. Perhaps it will be as interesting there as it is here on earth....\" \n \n \"And perhaps there is nothing at all there....\" he said, glancing at her with curiosity. \n \n \"Well, how can there help being!\"—she exclaimed, with conviction. —\"Of course there is!\" \n \n He decided not to interfere with her—let her go on philosophizing; at the proper moment he would stop her, and make her spread out before him the whole miserable little world of her imagination. She sat opposite him, with her small feet resting against a cross-bar, nailed to the bottom of the boat, and with every stroke of the oars,[Pg 346] she bent her body backward. Then, beneath the thin material of her gown, her virgin bosom was outlined in relief, high, springy, quivering with the exercise. \n \n \"She does not wear corsets,—\" said Ippolít Sergyéevitch to himself, dropping his eyes. But there they rested on her tiny feet. Pressed against the bottom of the boat, her legs were tensely stretched, and at such times their outlines were visible to the knees. \n \n \"Did she put on that idiotic dress on purpose?\"—he said to himself in vexation, and turned away, to look at the high shore. \n \n They had passed the park, and now they were floating under a steep cliff; from it swung curly pea-vines, the long slender wreaths of pumpkin, with their velvety leaves, large yellow circles of the sunflower, standing on the edge of the abyss, looked down into the water. The other shore, low and smooth, stretched away into the distance, to the green walls of the forest, and was thickly covered with grass, succulent and brilliant in hue; pale blue and dark blue flowers, as pretty as the eyes of children, peered caressingly forth from it at the boat. And ahead of them stood the dark-green forest—and the river pierced its way into it, like a piece of cold steel. \n \n \"Aren\u0027t you warm?\" asked Várenka. \n \n He glanced at her, and felt abashed:—upon her brow, beneath her crown of waving hair, glistened drops of perspiration, and her breast heaved high and rapidly. \n \n \"Pray forgive me!\"—he exclaimed penitently.—\"I forgot myself in looking about me ... you are tired ... give me the oars!\" \n \n \"I will not give them to you! Do you think I am tired? That is an insult to me! We haven\u0027t gone two versts yet.... No, keep your seat ... we will land presently, and take a stroll.\" \n \n [Pg 347] \n \n It was evident from her face, that it was useless to argue with her, and shrugging his shoulders with vexation, he made no reply, thinking to himself with displeasure: \"It is plain that she considers me weak.\" \n \n \"You see—this is the road to our house,—\" she pointed it out to him on the shore, with a nod of her head.—\"Here is the ford across the river, and from here to our house is fourteen versts. It is fine on our place, also, more beautiful than on your Polkánovka.\" \n \n \"Do you live in the country during the winter?\" he asked. \n \n \"Why not? You see, I have the entire charge of the housekeeping, papa never rises from his chair.... He is carried through the rooms.\" \n \n \"But you must find it tiresome to live in that way?\" \n \n \"Why? I have an awful lot to do ... and only one assistant—Nikon, papa\u0027s orderly. He is already an old man, and he drinks, besides, but he\u0027s awfully strong, and knows his business. The peasants are afraid of him he beats them, and they also once beat him terribly ... very terribly! He is remarkably honest, and he\u0027s devoted to papa and me ... he loves us like a dog! And I love him, too. Perhaps you have read a romance, where the hero is an officer, Count Grammont, and he had an orderly also, Sadi-Coco?\" \n \n \"I have not read it,—\" confessed the young savant modestly. \n \n \"You must be sure to read it—it is a good romance,—\" she advised him with conviction.—\"When Nikon pleases me, I call him Sadi-Coco. At first he used to get angry with me for that, but one day I read that romance to him, and now he knows that it is flattering for him to be like Sadi-Coco.\" \n \n [Pg 348] \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch looked at her, as a European looks at a delicately executed but fantastically-deformed statue of a Chinaman; with a mixture of amazement, compassion and curiosity. But she, with ardor, related to him the feats of Sadi-Coco, filled with disinterested devotion to Count Louis Grammont. \n \n \"Excuse me, Varvára[3] Vasílievna,\" he interrupted her,—\"but have you read the romances of the Russian writers?\" \n \n [3] Várenka it the caressing diminutive of Varvára.—Translator. \n \n \"Oh, yes! But I don\u0027t like them—they are tiresome, very tiresome! And they always write things which I know just as well as they do. They cannot invent anything interesting, and almost everything they say is true.\" \n \n \"But don\u0027t you like the truth?\"—asked Ippolít Sergyéevitch kindly. \n \n \"Ah, no indeed! I always speak the truth, straight to people\u0027s faces, and....\" \n \n She paused, reflected, and inquired: \n \n \"What is there to like in that? It is my habit, how can one like it?\" \n \n He did not manage to say anything to her on this point, because she quickly and loudly gave the command: \n \n \"Steer to the right ... be quick! To that oak-tree, yonder.... A?, how awkward you are!\" \n \n The boat did not obey his hand, and ran ashore broadside on, although he churned the water forcibly with his oar. \n \n \"Never mind, never mind,\" she said, and suddenly rising to her feet, she sprang over the side. \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch uttered a low shriek, and stretched his arms toward her, but she was standing uninjured on[Pg 349] the shore, holding the chain of the boat in her hands, and apologetically asking him: \n \n \"Did I frighten you?\" \n \n \"I thought you would fall into the water,—\" he said, softly. \n \n \"But could anyone fall there? And moreover, the water is not deep there,—\" she defended herself, dropping her eyes, and drawing the boat to the bank. And he, as he sat at the stem, reflected that he ought to have done that. \n \n \"Do you see what a forest there is?—\" she said, when he had stepped out on the bank, and stood beside her.—\"Isn\u0027t it fine here? There are no such beautiful forests around St. Petersburg, are there?\" \n \n In front of them lay a narrow road, hemmed in on both sides by tree trunks of different sizes. Under their feet the gnarled roots, crushed by the wheels of peasant-carts, lay outstretched, and over them was a thick tent of boughs, with here and there, high aloft, blue scraps of sky. The rays of sunlight, slender as violin-strings, quivered in the air, obliquely intersecting this narrow, green corridor. The odor of rotting foliage, of mushrooms and birch trees, surrounded them. Birds flitted past, disturbing the solemn stillness of the forest with their lively songs and anxious twittering. A woodpecker was tapping somewhere, a bee was buzzing, and in front of them, as though showing them the road, two butterflies fluttered, in pursuit of each other. \n \n They strolled slowly on. Ippolít Sergyéevitch was silent, and did not interfere with Várenka\u0027s finding words wherewith to express her thoughts, while she said warmly to him: \n \n \"I don\u0027t like to read about the peasants; what can there[Pg 350] be that is interesting in their lives? I know them, I live with them, and I see that people do not write accurately, do not write the truth about them. They are described as such wretched creatures, but they are only base, and there is nothing to pity them for. They want only one thing—to cheat us, to steal something from us. They are always importuning us, always moaning, they\u0027re disgusting, dirty ... and they\u0027re clever, oh! they\u0027re even very cunning. Oh, if you only knew how they torture me sometimes!\" \n \n She had warmed up to her theme now, and wrath and bad humor were expressed on her face. Evidently, the peasants occupied a large place in her life; she rose to hatred, as she depicted them. Ippolít Sergyéevitch was astonished at the violence of her agitation but, as he did not care to hear these sallies from the master\u0027s point of view, he interrupted the young girl: \n \n \"You were speaking of the French writers....\" \n \n \"Ah, yes! That is to say, about the Russian writers,—\" she corrected him, calming down,—\"you ask, why the Russians write worse than they,—that is dear enough! because they do not invent anything interesting. The French writers have real heroes, who do not talk like everybody else, and who behave differently. They are always brave, in love, jolly ... but with us, the heroes are simple little men, without daring, without fiery feelings,—ugly, pitiful little creatures—the most real sort of men, and nothing more! Why are they heroes? You will never understand that in a Russian book. The Russian hero is a stupid, sluggish sort of fellow, he\u0027s always disgusted with something, he\u0027s always thinking of something incomprehensible, and he pities everybody, and he himself is pitiful, ve-ery pi-tiful indeed! He meditates, and talks[Pg 351] and then he goes to make a declaration of love, and then he meditates again until he gets married ... and when he is married, he says sour nonsense to his wife, and abandons her.... What is there interesting in that? It even angers me, because it resembles a deception—instead of a hero, there is always some sort of a stuffed scarecrow stuck up in a romance! And never, while you are reading a Russian book, can you forget real life,—is that nice? But when you read the works of a Frenchman—you shudder for the heroes, you pity them, you hate, you want to fight when they fight, you weep when they perish ... you wait for the end of the romance with passionate interest, and when you read it—you almost cry with vexation, because that is all. You live—but in Russian books, it is utterly incomprehensible why men live. Why write books, if you cannot narrate anything unusual? Really, it is strange!\" \n \n \"There is a great deal which might be said in reply to you, Varvára Vasílievna,—\" he stemmed the stormy tide of her speech. \n \n \"Well then, reply!—\" she burst out, with a smile.—\"Of course, you will rout me!\" \n \n \"I shall try. First of all, what Russian authors have you read?\" \n \n \"Various ... but they are all alike. Take Saliás, for example ... he imitates the French, but badly. However, he has Russian heroes also, and can one write anything interesting about them? And I have read a great many others—Mórdovtzeff, Márkevitch, Pazúkhin, I think—you see, even from their names it is plain that they cannot write well! You haven\u0027t read them? But have you read Fortuné de Boisgobey? Ponson du Terrail? Arsène Houssaye? Pierre Zaconné? Dumas, Gaboriau,[Pg 352] Borne? How fine, good heavens! Wait ... do you know what pleases me most in romances is the villains, those who so artfully weave various spiteful plots, who murder and poison,... they\u0027re clever, strong ... and when, at last, they are caught,—rage seizes upon me, and I even go so far as to cry. Everybody hates the villain, everybody is against him—he is alone against them all! That\u0027s—a hero! And those others, the virtuous people, become disgusting, when they win.... And, in general, do you know, people please me so long as they strongly desire something, march forward somewhere, seek something, torment themselves ... but if they have reached their goal, and have come to a halt, then they are no longer interesting ... they are even insipid!\" \n \n Excited, and, probably, proud of what she had said to him, she walked slowly by his side, raising her head prettily, and flashing her eyes. \n \n He looked into her face, and nervously twisting his head, he sought for a retort which should, at one stroke, tear from her mind that coarse veil of dust which enveloped it. But, while feeling himself bound to reply to her, he wished to listen longer to her ingenuous and original chatter, to behold her again carried away with her opinions, and sincerely laying bare her soul before him. He had never heard such speeches; they were hideous and impossible in his eyes, but, at the same time, everything she had said harmonized, to perfection, with her rather rapacious beauty. Before him was an unpolished mind, which offended him by its roughness, and a woman who was seductively beautiful, who irritated his sensuality. These two forces crushed him down with all the energy of their directness, and he must set up something in opposition to them, otherwise, he felt—they might drive him out of the[Pg 353] wonted ruts of those views and moods, with which he had dwelt in peace until he met her. He possessed a clear sense of logic, and he had argued well with persons of his own circle. But how was he to talk with her, and what ought he say to her, in order to urge her mind into the right road, and ennoble her soul, which had been deformed by stupid novels, and the society of the peasants, and of that soldier, her drunken father? \n \n \"Ugh, how foolishly I have been talking!—\" she exclaimed, with a sigh.—\"I have bored you, haven\u0027t I?\" \n \n \"No, but....\" \n \n \"You see, I\u0027m very glad to know you. Until you came, I had no one to talk with. Your sister does not like me, and is always angry with me ... it must be became I give my father vódka, and because I thrashed Nikon....\" \n \n \"You?! You thrashed him? Eh ... how did you do that?\"—said Ippolít Sergyéevitch, in amazement. \n \n \"Very simply, I lashed him with papa\u0027s kazák whip, that\u0027s all! You know, they were threshing the grain, there was an awful hurry, and he, the beast, was drunk! Wasn\u0027t I angry! How dared he get drunk when the work was seething, and his eyes were needed in every direction? Those peasants, they....\" \n \n \"But, listen, Varvára Vasílievna,—\" he began, impressively and as gently as possible,—\"is it nice to beat a servant? Is that noble? Reflect! Did those heroes, whom you adore, beat their admirers?... Sadi-Coco....\" \n \n \"Oh, indeed they did! One day, Count Louis gave Coco such a box on the ear, that I even felt sorry for the poor little soldier. And what can I do with them, except beat them? It\u0027s a good thing I am able to do it ... for I am strong! Feel what muscles I\u0027ve got!\" \n \n [Pg 354] \n \n Bending her arm at the elbow, she proudly offered it to him. He laid his hand on her arm above her elbow, and pressed it hard with his fingers, but immediately recollected himself, and in confusion, blushing crimson, he looked around him. Everywhere the trees stood in silence, and only.... \n \n In general, he was not modest with women, but this woman, by her simplicity and trustfulness made him so, although she kindled in him a feeling which was perilous to him. \n \n \"You have enviable health,—\" he said, staring intently and thoughtfully at her little, sun-burned hand, as it adjusted the folds of her gown on her bosom.—\"And I think that you have a very good heart,—\" he broke out, unexpectedly to himself. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know!\"—she retorted, shaking her head. \"Hardly,—I have no character: sometimes I feel sorry for people, even for those whom I do not like.\" \n \n \"Only sometimes?\"—he laughed.—\"But, surely, they are always deserving of pity and sympathy.\" \n \n \"What for?\"—she inquired, smiling also. \n \n \"Cannot you see how unhappy they are? Take those peasants of yours, for example. How difficult it is for them to live, and how much injustice, woe, torture there is in their lives.\" \n \n This burst hotly from him, and she looked attentively at his face, as she said: \n \n \"You must be very good, if you speak like that. But, you see, you don\u0027t know the peasants, you have not lived in the country. They are unhappy, it is true—but who is to blame for that? They are crafty, and no one prevents their becoming happy.\" \n \n \"But they have not even bread enough to satisfy their hunger!\" \n \n [Pg 355] \n \n \"I should think not! See what a lot of them there are....\" \n \n \"Yes, there are a great many of them! But there is a great deal of land, also ... for there are people who own tens of thousands of desyatinas.[4] For instance, how much have you?\" \n \n [4] A desyatína is 2.70 acres.—Translator. \n \n \"Five hundred and seventy-three desyatinas.. Well, and what of that? Is it possible ... come, listen to me! Is it possible to give it to them?\" \n \n She gazed at him with the look of an adult on a child, and laughed softly. This laughter confused and angered him.... There flashed up within him the desire to convince her of the errors of her mind. \n \n And, pronouncing his words distinctly, even sharply, he began to talk to her about the injustice of the distribution of wealth, about the majority of men\u0027s lack of rights, about the fatal struggle for a place in life and for a morsel of bread, about the power of the rich and the helplessness of the poor, and about the mind—the guide in life, crushed by century-long injustice, and the host of prejudices, which are advantageous to the powerful minority of people. \n \n She maintained silence, as she walked along by his side, and gazed at him with curiosity and surprise. \n \n Around them reigned the dusky tranquillity of the forest, that tranquillity across which sounds seem to slide, without disturbing its melancholy harmony. The leaves of the aspens quivered nervously, as though the trees were impatiently awaiting something passionately longed for. \n \n \"The duty of every honest man,\" said Ippolít Sergyéevitch impressively, \"is to contribute to the conflict on behalf of the enslaved all his brain, and all his heart,[Pg 356] endeavoring either to put an end to the tortures of the conflict, or to hasten its progress. For that genuine heroism is required, and precisely in this conflict is where you ought to look for it. Outside of it—there is no heroism. The heroes of this fight are the only ones who are worthy of admiration and imitation ... and you ought to direct your attention precisely to this spot, Varvára Vasílievna, seek your heroes here, expend your strength here ... it seems to me, that you might become a notably-steadfast defender of the truth! But, first of all, you must read a great deal, you must learn to understand life in its real aspect, unadorned by fancy ... you must fling all those stupid romances into the fire....\" \n \n He paused, and wiping the perspiration from his brow, he waited—wearied with his long speech—to see what she would say. \n \n She was gazing into the distance, straight ahead of her, with her eyes narrowed, and on her face quivered shadows. Five minutes of silence were broken by her quiet exclamation: \n \n \"How well you talk!... Is it possible that everybody in the university can talk so well?\" \n \n The young savant heaved a hopeless sigh, and expectation of her answer gave place within him to a dull irritation against her, and compassion for himself. Why would not she accept what was so logically clear for every being endowed with the very smallest reasoning powers? What, precisely, was lacking in his remarks, that they failed to strike home to her feelings? \n \n \"You talk very well!—\" she sighed, without waiting for him to reply, and in her eyes he read genuine satisfaction. \n \n \"But do I speak truthfully?\"—he asked. \n \n \"No!—\" replied the young girl, without stopping to[Pg 357] think.—\"Although you are a learned man, I shall argue with you. For, you see, I also understand some things!—You speak so that it appears.. as though people were building a house, and all of them were equals in the work. And even not they only, but everything:—the bricks, and the carpenters, and the trees, and the master of the house—with you, everything is equal to everything else. But is that possible? The peasant must work, you must teach, and the Governor must watch, to see if everybody does what is necessary. And then you said, that life is a battle ... well, where is it? On the contrary, people live very peaceably. But if it is a battle, then there must be vanquished people. But the general utility is something that I cannot understand. You say that general utility consists in the equality of all men. But that is not true! My papa is a colonel—how is he the equal of Nikon or of a peasant? And you—you are a learned man, but are you the equal of our teacher of the Russian language, who drank vódka, who was red-headed, stupid, and blew his nose loudly, like a trumpet? Aha!\" \n \n She exulted, regarding her arguments as irresistible, while he admired her joyous agitation, and felt satisfied with himself, because he had caused her this joy. \n \n But his mind strove to solve the problem why the solid thought, unassailed by analysis, which he had aroused, worked in a direction exactly opposite to the one in which he had thrust it? \n \n \"I like you and I do not like some other person ... where is the equality?\" \n \n \"You like me?—\" Ippolít Sergyéevitch inquired, rather abruptly. \n \n \"Yes ... very much!\" she nodded her head affirmatively, and immediately asked: \n \n [Pg 358] \n \n \"What of it?\" \n \n He was frightened for himself in the presence of the abyss of ingenuousness which looked forth at him from her clear gaze. \n \n \"Can this be her way of coquetting?\"—he thought—\"she has read romances enough, apparently, to understand herself as a woman....\" \n \n \"Why do you ask about that?—\" she persisted, gazing into his face with curious eyes. \n \n Her gaze confused him. \n \n \"Why?\"—He shrugged his shoulders,—\"I think it is natural. You are a woman ... I am a man....\" he explained, as calmly as he could. \n \n \"Well, and what of that? All the same, there is no reason why you should know. You see, you are not preparing to marry me!\" \n \n She said this so simply, that he was not even disconcerted. It merely struck him, that some power, with which it was useless to contend in view of its blind, elemental character, was altering the work of his brain from one direction to another. And, with a shade of playfulness, he said to her: \n \n \"Who knows?... And then ... the desire to please, and the desire to marry, or to get married—are not identical, as you surely must know.\" \n \n She suddenly burst out into a loud laugh, and he immediately cooled under her laughter, and mutely cursed both himself and her. Her bosom quivered with rich, sincere mirth, which merrily shook the air, but he remained silent, guiltily awaiting a retort to his playfulness. \n \n \"Okh! well, what sort ... what sort of a wife ... should I make for you! It\u0027s as ridiculous ... as the ostrich and the bee! Ha, ha, ha!\" \n \n [Pg 359] \n \n And he, also, broke into laughter,—not at her queer comparison, but at his own failure to comprehend the springs which governed the movements of her soul. \n \n \"You are a charming girl!\"—he broke out sincerely. \n \n \"Give me your hand ... you walk very slowly, and I will pull you along! It is time for us to turn back ... high time! We have been roaming for four hours ... and Elizavéta Sergyéevna will be displeased with us, because we are late for dinner....\" \n \n They went back. Ippolít Sergyéevitch felt himself bound to return to his explanation of her errors, which did not permit him to feel as free by her side as he would have liked to be. But first it was necessary to suppress within himself that obscure uneasiness, which was dully fermenting in him, impeding his intention to listen calmly to her arguments, and to controvert them with decision. It would be so easy for him to cut away the abnormal excrescence from her brain by the cold logic of his mind, if that strange, enervating, nameless sensation did not embarrass him. What was it? It resembled a disinclination to introduce into the spiritual realm of this young girl ideas which were foreign to her.... But such an evasion of his obligations would be shameful in a man who was steadfast in his principles. And he regarded himself in that light, and was profoundly convinced of the power of his mind, and of its supremacy over feeling. \n \n \"Is to-day Tuesday?\" she said.—\"Yes, of course. That means, that three days hence the little black gentleman will arrive....\" \n \n \"Who will arrive, and where, did you say?\" \n \n \"The little black gentleman, Benkóvsky, will come to us on Saturday.\" \n \n \"Why?\" \n \n [Pg 360] \n \n She began to laugh, gazing searchingly at him. \n \n \"Don\u0027t you know? He\u0027s an official....\" \n \n \"Ah! yes, my sister told me....\" \n \n \"She told you?\" said Várenka, becoming animated.— \n \n \"Well, tell me then—will they be married soon?\" \n \n \"What do you mean by that? Why should they marry?\"—asked Ippolít Sergyéevitch disconcerted. \n \n \"Why?\"—said Várenka, in amazement, with a vivid blush.—\"Why, I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s the regulation thing to do! But, oh Lord! Can it be possible that you did not know about that?\" \n \n \"I know nothing!—\" ejaculated Ippolít Sergyéevitch with decision. \n \n \"And I have told you!\"—she cried, in despair.—\"A pretty thing, truly! Please, my dear Ippolít Sergyéevitch, don\u0027t know anything about it now ... as though I had not said anything!\" \n \n \"Very well! But permit me; I really do not know anything. I have understood one thing—that my sister is going to marry Mr. Benkóvsky.. is that it?\" \n \n \"Well, yes! That is to say, if she herself has not told you that, perhaps it will not take place. You will not tell her about this?\" \n \n \"I will not tell her, of course!\" promised he.—\"I came hither to a funeral, and have hit upon a wedding, it seems? That is pleasant!\" \n \n \"Please don\u0027t say a word about the wedding!—\" she entreated him.—\"You don\u0027t know anything.\" \n \n \"That is perfectly true.—What sort of a person is this Mr. Benkóvsky? May I inquire?\" \n \n \"You may, about him! He\u0027s rather black of complexion, rather sweet, and rather taciturn. He has little eyes, a little mustache, little lips, little hands and a little fiddle.[Pg 361] He loves tender little songs, and little cheese patties. I always feel like rapping him over his little snout.\" \n \n \"Well, you don\u0027t love him!\" exclaimed Ippolít Sergyéevitch, feeling sorry for Mr. Benkóvsky at this humiliating description of his exterior. \n \n \"And he does not love me! I ... I can\u0027t endure little, sweet, unassuming men. A man ought to be tall, and strong; he ought to talk loudly, his eyes should be large, fiery, and his emotions should be bold, and know no impediments. He should will a thing and do it—that\u0027s a man!\" \n \n \"Apparently, there are no more such!\" said Ippolít Sergyéevitch, with a dry laugh, feeling that her ideal of a man was repulsive to him, and irritated him. \n \n \"There must be some!\" she exclaimed with confidence. \n \n \"But Varvára Vasílievna, you have depicted a sort of wild beast! What is there attractive about such a monster?\" \n \n \"He\u0027s not a wild beast at all, but a strong man! Strength—that is what is attractive. The men nowadays are born with rheumatism, with a cough, with various diseases—is that nice? Would I find it interesting, for example, to have for a husband a gentleman with pimples on his face, like County Chief Kokóvitch? or a pretty little gentleman, like Benkóvsky? Ora round-shouldered, gaunt hop-pole, like court-usher Múkhin? Or Grísha Tchernonéboff, the merchant\u0027s son, a fat man, with the asthma, and a bald head, and a red nose? What sort of children could such trashy husbands have? For, you see, one must think of that ... mustn\u0027t one? For the children are a very important consideration! But those men don\u0027t think.... They love nothing. They are good for nothing, and I ... I would beat my husband if I were married to any of those men!\" \n \n [Pg 362] \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch stopped her, demonstrating that her judgment of men was, in general, incorrect, because she had seen too few people. And the men she had mentioned must not be regarded from the external point of view alone—that was unjust. A man may have an ugly nose, but a fine soul, pimples on his face, but a brilliant mind. He found it tiresome and difficult to enunciate these elementary truths; until his meeting with her, he had so rarely remembered their existence, that now they all appeared to him musty and threadbare. He felt that all this did not suit her, and that she would not accept it. \n \n \"There is the river!\" she exclaimed joyfully, interrupting his speech. \n \n And Ippolít Sergyéevitch reflected: \n \n \"She rejoices, because I am silenced.\" \n \n Again they floated along the river, seated facing each other. Várenka took possession of the oars, and rowed hastily, powerfully; the water involuntarily gurgled under the boat, little waves flowed to the shores. Ippolít Sergyéevitch watched the shores moving to meet the boat, and felt exhausted with all he had said and heard during the course of this expedition. \n \n \"See, how fast the boat is going!\" Várenka said to him. \n \n \"Yes,\" he replied briefly, without turning his eyes to her. It made no difference even without seeing her, he could picture to himself how seductively her body was bending and her bosom was heaving. \n \n The park came in sight ... Soon they were walking up its avenue, and the graceful figure of Elizavéta Sergyéevna was coming to meet them, with a significant smile. She held some papers in her hands, and said: \n \n \"Well, you have had a long walk!\" \n \n \"Have we been gone long! On the other hand, I have such an appetite, that I—ugh! I could eat you!\" \n \n [Pg 363] \n \n And Várenka, encircling Elizavéta Sergyéevna\u0027s waist, whirled her lightly round her, laughing at the latter\u0027s cries. \n \n The dinner was tasteless and tiresome, because Várenka was engrossed with the process of satisfying her hunger, and maintained silence, and Elizavéta Sergyéevna was angry with her brother, who observed the searching glances which she directed at his face, every now and then. Soon after dinner, Várenka drove off homeward, and Ippolít Sergyéevitch went to his room, lay down on the divan, and began to meditate, summing up the impressions of the day. He recalled the most trivial details of the walk, and felt that a turbid sediment was being formed from them, which was eating into his stable equilibrium of mind and feeling. He even felt the physical novelty of his mood, in the shape of a strange weight, which oppressed his heart—as though his blood had coagulated during that time, and was circulating more slowly than was its wont. This resembled fatigue, inclined him to revery, and formed the preface to some desire which had not yet assumed form. And this was disagreeable only because it remained a nameless sensation, despite Ippolít Sergyéevitch\u0027s efforts to give it a name. \n \n \"I must wait to analyze it, until the fermentation has subsided....\" he came to the conclusion. \n \n But a feeling of keen dissatisfaction with himself presented itself, and he simultaneously reproached himself for having lost the ability to control his emotions, and for having that day conducted himself in a manner unbecoming a serious man. Alone with himself, he was always firm and stem with himself, more so than when with other people. Accordingly, he now began to scrutinize himself. \n \n Indisputably, that young girl was stupefyingly beautiful,[Pg 364] but to behold her, and instantly to enter in the dark circle of some troubled sensation or other—was too much for her, and was disgraceful for him, for that was wantonness, a lack of strength of character. She strongly stirred his sensuality,—yes, but he must contend against that. \n \n \"Must I?\"—suddenly flashed into his head the curt, poignant question. \n \n He frowned, and bore himself toward the question as though it had been put by someone outside of himself. In any case, what was going on within him was not the beginning of a passion for a woman, rather was it a protest of his mind, which had been affronted by the encounter from which he had not emerged as the conqueror, although his opponent had been as weak as a child. He ought to have talked to that girl figuratively, for it was evident that she did not understand a logical argument. His duty was to exterminate her wild conceptions, to destroy all those coarse and stupid fancies, with which her brain was soaked. He must strip her mind of all those errors, purify, empty her soul, and then she would be capable of accepting the truth and of holding it within her. \n \n \"Can I do that?\"—an irrelevant question again flashed up within him. And again he evaded it.... What would she be like, when she had accepted something new, and contrary to what was already in her? And it seemed to him, that when her soul, freed from the captivity of error, should have become permeated with harmonious teaching, foreign to everything obscure and blinding,—that young girl would be doubly beautiful. \n \n When he was called to tea, he had already firmly made up his mind to reconstruct her world, imposing this decision upon himself as a direct obligation. Now he would meet her coldly and composedly, and would impart to his[Pg 365] intercourse with her a character of stem criticism of everything that she should say, or should do. \n \n \"Well, how do you like Várenka?\"—inquired his sister, when he emerged on the terrace. \n \n \"Very charming girl,\" he replied, elevating his brows. \n \n \"Yes? So, that\u0027s it ... I thought you would be struck by her lack of development.\" \n \n \"I really am rather surprised at that side of her,—\" he assented.—\"But, to speak frankly, she is, in many ways, better than the girls who are developed and who put on airs over that fact.\" \n \n \"Yes, she is handsome.. and a desirable bride ... she has five hundred desyatinas of very fine land, about one hundred of building timber. And, in addition, she will inherit a solid estate from her aunt. And neither estate is mortgaged....\" \n \n He perceived that his sister was determined not to understand him, but he did not care to explain to himself why she found this necessary. \n \n \"I do not look at her from that point of view,—\" said he. \n \n \"Do so, then ... I seriously advise it.\" \n \n \"Thanks.\" \n \n \"You are a little out of temper, apparently?\" \n \n \"On the contrary. But what of that?\" \n \n \"Nothing. I want to know it, as an anxious sister.\" \n \n She smiled prettily, and rather ingratiatingly. That smile reminded him of Mr. Benkóvsky, and he, also, smiled at her. \n \n \"What are you laughing at?—\" she inquired. \n \n \"And you, what are you laughing at?\" \n \n \"I feel merry.\" \n \n \"I feel merry also, although I did not bury my wife two weeks ago,—\" he said, with a laugh. \n \n [Pg 366] \n \n But she put on a serious face, and sighed, as she said: \n \n \"Perhaps, in your soul, you condemn me for lack of feeling toward my deceased husband. You think that I am egotistical? But, Ippolít, you know what my husband was, I wrote to you what my life was like. And I often said to myself:—\u0027My God! and was I created merely for the purpose of pleasing the coarse appetites of Nikolá? Stepánovitch Banártzeff, when he has drunk himself into such a state of intoxication that he cannot distinguish his wife from a simple peasant woman, or a woman of the street?\u0027\" \n \n \"You don\u0027t say so!\" ... exclaimed Ippolít Sergyéevitch, recalling her letters, in which she had talked a great deal about her husband\u0027s lack of character, his fondness for liquor, his indolence, and of all vices except debauchery. \n \n \"Do you doubt it?—\" she inquired reproachfully, and sighed. —\"Nevertheless, it is a fact. He was often in such a condition.... I do not assert that he betrayed me, but I admit it. Could he be conscious, whether I was with him, or some other woman, when he mistook the window for the door? Yes.. and that was the way I lived for years....\" She talked long and tediously to him about her sad life, and he listened and waited for her to tell him the thing that she wished to tell. And it involuntarily occurred to him, that Várenka would never be likely to complain of her life, however it might turn out for her. \n \n \"It seems to me that fate ought to reward me for those long years of grief.... Perhaps it is near—my recompense.\" \n \n Elizavéta Sergyéevna paused, and casting an interrogative glance at her brother, she blushed slightly. \n \n \"What do you mean to say?\"—he inquired, affectionately, bending toward her. \n \n [Pg 367] \n \n \"You see ... perhaps I shall ... marry again!\" \n \n \"And you will do exactly right! I congratulate you!... But why are you so disconcerted?\" \n \n \"Really, I do not know!\" \n \n \"Who is he?\" \n \n \"I think I have mentioned him to you ... Benkóvsky ... the future procurator ... and, in the meantime, a poet and dreamer.... Perhaps you have come across his verses? He prints them....\" \n \n \"I do not read verses. Is he a good man? However, of course he is good....\" \n \n \"I am sufficiently clever not to answer in the affirmative; but I think I may say, without self-delusion, that he is capable of making up to me for the past. He loves me.... I have invented a little philosophy for myself ... perhaps it will seem rather harsh to you.\" \n \n \"Philosophize without fear, that\u0027s the fashion at present ...\" jested Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n \"Men and women are two tribes, which are everlastingly at war\" said the woman softly,... \"Confidence, friendship and other feelings of that sort, are hardly possible between me and a man. But love is possible.... And love is the victory of the one who loves the least over the one who loves the most.... I have been conquered once, and have paid for it ... now I have won the victory, and shall enjoy the fruits of conquest....\" \n \n \"It is a tolerably fierce sort of philosophy,...\" Ippolít Sergyéevitch interrupted her, feeling, with satisfaction, that Várenka could not philosophize in that manner. \n \n \"Life has taught it to me.... You see, he is four years younger than I am,... he has only just finished at the university,... I know that that is dangerous for me ... and, how shall I express it?... I should like to[Pg 368] arrange matters with him in such a way, that my property-right shall not be subjected to any risk.\" \n \n \"Yes ... so what then?\" inquired Ippolít Sergyéevitch, becoming attentive. \n \n \"So, you are to advise me as to how this is to be arranged. I do not wish to give him any legal rights over my property ... and I would not give him any over my person, if that could be avoided.\" \n \n \"It strikes me that that could be effected by a civil marriage. However....\" \n \n \"No, I reject a civil marriage....\" \n \n He looked at her, and thought, with a feeling of fastidiousness: \"Well, she is wise! If God created men, life re-creates them so easily, that they certainly must have long ago become repulsive to him.\" \n \n And his sister convincingly explained to him her view of marriage. \n \n \"Marriage ought to be a reasonable contract, excluding every risk. That is precisely how I mean to deal with Benkóvsky. But, before taking that step, I should like to clear up the legality of that vexatious brother\u0027s claim. Please look over these documents.\" \n \n \"Will you permit me to undertake this matter to-morrow\"—he inquired. \n \n \"Of course, when you like.\" \n \n She continued, for a long time, to set forth her ideas to him, then she told him a great deal about Benkóvsky. Of him she spoke condescendingly, with a smile flitting over her lips, and, for some reason, with her eyes puckered up, Ippolít listened to her, and was amazed at the utter absence in himself of all sympathy for her fate, or interest in her remarks. \n \n [Pg 369] \n \n The sun had already set when they parted, he, exhausted by her, to his own room; she, animated by the conversation, with a confident sparkle in her eyes,—to attend to her housekeeping. \n \n When he arrived in his own quarters, Ippolít lighted the lamp, got a book, and tried to read; but with the very first page, he comprehended that it would please him equally well if he closed the book. Stretching himself luxuriously, he closed it, and fidgetted about in his arm-chair, seeking a comfortable attitude, but the chair was hard; then he betook himself to the divan, and lay down on it. At first, he thought of nothing at all; then, with vexation, he remembered, that he would soon be obliged to make the acquaintance of Mr. Benkóvsky, and immediately he smiled, as he recalled the sketch which Várenka had given of that gentleman. \n \n And soon she alone occupied his thoughts and his imagination. Among other things, he thought: \n \n \"And what if I were to marry such a charming monster? I think she might prove a very interesting wife if only for the reason that one does not hear from her mouth the cheap wisdom of the popular books....\" \n \n But after having surveyed his position, in the character of Várenka\u0027s husband, from all sides, he began to laugh, and categorically answered himself: \n \n \"Never!\" \n \n And after that, he felt sad. \n \n [Pg 370] \n II \n \n On Saturday morning, a little unpleasantness began for Ippolít Sergyéevitch: as he was dressing himself, he had knocked the lamp off of the little table to the floor, it had flown into fragments, and several drops of kerosene from the broken reservoir had fallen into one of his shoes, which he had not yet put on his feet. The shoes, of course, had been cleaned, but it began to seem to Ippolít Sergyéevitch that a repulsive, oily odor was streaming upon the air from the tea, the bread, the butter, and even from the beautifully dressed hair of his sister. \n \n This spoiled his temper. \n \n \"Take off the shoe, and set it in the sun, then the kerosene will evaporate,—\" his sister advised him.—\"And, in the meantime, put on my husband\u0027s slippers, there is one pair which is perfectly new.\" \n \n \"Please don\u0027t worry. It will soon disappear.\" \n \n \"It is of the greatest importance to wait until it disappears. Really, shall not I order the slippers to be brought?\" \n \n \"No ... I don\u0027t want them. Throw them away.\" \n \n \"Why? They are nice slippers, of velvet ... they are fit to use.\" \n \n He wanted to argue, the kerosene irritated him. \n \n \"What will they be good for? You will not wear them.\" \n \n \"Of course I shall not, but Alexander will.\" \n \n \"Who is he?\" \n \n \"Why, Benkóvsky.\" \n \n \"Aha!—\" he gave way to a hard laugh.—\"That is very touching fidelity on the part of your dead husband\u0027s slippers. And practical.\" \n \n \"You are malicious to-day.\" \n \n [Pg 371] \n \n She looked at him somewhat offended, but very searchingly, and, he, catching that expression in her eyes, thought unpleasantly: \n \n \"She certainly imagines that I am irritated by Várenka\u0027s absence.\" \n \n \"Benkóvsky will arrive in time for dinner, probably,—\" she informed him, after a pause. \n \n \"I\u0027m very glad to hear it,—\" he replied, as he commented to himself: \n \n \"She wants me to be amiable toward my future brother-in-law.\" \n \n And his irritation was augmented by a feeling of oppressive boredom. But Elizavéta Sergyéevna said, as she carefully spread a thin layer of butter on her bread: \n \n \"Practicalness, in my opinion, is a very praiseworthy quality. Especially at the present moment, when impoverishment so oppresses our brethren, who live upon the fruits of the earth. Why should not Benkóvsky wear the slippers of my deceased husband?...\" \n \n \"And his shroud also, if you removed the shroud from him, and have preserved it,\"—said Ippolít Sergyéevitch venomously to himself, concentrating his attention upon the operation of transferring the boiled cream from the cream-jug to his glass. \n \n \"And, altogether, my husband has left a very extensive and appropriate wardrobe. And Benkóvsky is not spoiled. For you know how many of them there are—three young fellows besides Alexander, and five young girls. And the estate has about ten mortgages on it. You know, I purchased their library, on very advantageous terms;—there are some very valuable things in it. Look it over, and perhaps you will find something you need.... Alexander subsists on a very paltry salary.\" \n \n [Pg 372] \n \n \"Have you known him long?—\" he asked her;—it was necessary to talk about Benkóvsky, although he did not wish to do so. \n \n \"Four years, altogether, and so ... intimately, seven or eight months. You will see that he is very nice. He is so tender, so easily excited, and something of an idealist, a decadent, I think. However, all the young generation are inclined to decadentism.... Some fall on the side of idealism, others on the side of materialism ... and both sorts seem very clever to me.\" \n \n \"There are men who profess \u0027scepticism of a hundred horse power,\u0027 as one of my comrades has defined it,—\" said Ippolít Sergyéevitch, bending his face over his glass. \n \n She laughed, as she said: \n \n \"That is witty, though it is also rather coarse. Really, I am on the verge of scepticism myself, the healthy scepticism, you know, which fetters the wings of all possible impulses, and seems to me indispensable for ... the acquisition of correct views as to the life of people.\" \n \n He made haste to finish his tea, and went away, announcing that he had to sort over the books which he had brought with him. But the odor of kerosene lingered still in his chamber, in spite of the open doors. He scowled, and taking a book, he went out into the park. There, in the closely clustered family of ancient trees, wearied with gales and thunderstorms, reigned a melancholy silence, which enervated the mind, and he walked on, without opening his book, down the principal avenue, thinking of nothing, desiring nothing. \n \n Here was the river and the boat. Here he had seen Várenka reflected in the water, and angelically beautiful in that reflection. \n \n \"Well, I\u0027m just like a boy from the gymnasium!\" he[Pg 373] cried to himself, conscious that the memory of her was agreeable to him. \n \n After halting for a moment by the side of the river, he stepped into the boat, seated himself in the stern, and began to gaze at that picture in the water, which had been so lovely three days before. It was equally beautiful to-day, but to-day, on its transparent background the white figure of that strange young girl did not make its appearance. Polkánoff lighted a cigarette, and immediately flung it into the water, reflecting that, perhaps, he had done a foolish thing in coming hither. As a matter of fact, of what use was he there? Apparently, only for the sake of preserving his sister\u0027s good name, to speak more simply, in order to enable his sister to receive Mr. Benkóvsky into her house, without offending the proprieties. It was not an important r?le.... And that Benkóvsky could not be very clever if he really did love Polkánoff\u0027s sister, who was, if anything, too clever. \n \n After having sat there for three hours in a semi-meditative condition, his thoughts paralyzed, in a certain way, and gliding over subjects, without sitting in judgment upon them, he rose, and went slowly to the house, angry with himself for the uselessly wasted time, and firmly resolving to set to work as speedily as possible. As he approached the terrace, he beheld a slender young man, in a white blouse, girt with a strap. The young man was standing with his back to the avenue, and was looking at something, as he bent over the table. Ippolít Sergyéevitch slackened his pace, wondering whether this could possibly be Benkóvsky? Then the young man straightened up, with a graceful gesture flung back the long locks of curling hair from his brow, and turned his face toward the avenue. \n \n [Pg 374] \n \n \"Why, he\u0027s a page of the Middle Ages!\" exclaimed Ippolít Sergyéevitch to himself. \n \n Benkóvsky\u0027s face was oval, of a dead-white hue, and appeared jaded, because of the strained gleam of his large, almond-shaped, black eyes, deeply sunken in their orbits. His beautifully formed mouth was shaded by a small, black mustache, and his arched brow by locks of carelessly dishevelled, waving hair. He was small, below middle stature, but his willowy figure, elegantly built, and finely proportioned, concealed this defect. He looked at Ippolít Sergyéevitch as short-sighted persons look, and there was something sympathetic, but sickly, about his pale face. In a velvet beretta and costume, he really would seem like a page who had escaped from a picture representing a court of the Middle Ages. \n \n \"Benkóvsky!\"—he said, in a low tone, offering his white hand, with the long, slender fingers of a musician, to Ippolít Sergyéevitch, as the latter ascended the steps of the terrace. \n \n The young savant shook his hand cordially. \n \n For a moment, both preserved an awkward silence, then Ippolít Sergyéevitch began to talk about the beauty of the park. The young man answered him briefly, being anxious, evidently, merely to comply with the demands of politeness, and exhibiting no interest whatever in his companion. \n \n Elizavéta Sergyéevna soon made her appearance, in a loose white gown, with black lace on the collar, and girt at the waist with a long, black cord, terminating in tassels. This costume harmonized well with her calm countenance, imparting a majestic expression to its small, but regular features. On her cheeks played a flush of satisfaction, and her cold eyes had an animated look. \n \n [Pg 375] \n \n \"Dinner will be ready at once,—\" she announced.—\"I am going to treat you to ice-cream. But why are you so bored, Alexander Petróvitch? Yes! You have not forgotten Schubert?\" \n \n \"I have brought Schubert and the books,—\" he replied frankly, and meditatively admiring her. \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch observed the expression of his face, and felt awkward, comprehending that this charming young man must have made a vow to himself not to recognize his existence. \n \n \"That\u0027s fine!\"—exclaimed Elizavéta Sergyéevna, smiling at Benkóvsky.—\"Shall we play it after dinner?\" \"If you like!—\" and he bowed his head before her. This was gracefully done, but, nevertheless, it made Ippolít Sergyéevitch grin inwardly. \n \n \"It does please me very much,—\" declared his sister coquettishly. \n \n \"And are you fond of Schubert?—\" inquired Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n \"I love Beethoven best of all—he is the Shakspear of music,—\" replied Benkóvsky, turning his profile toward him. \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch had heard Beethoven called the Shakspear of music before, and the difference between him and Schubert constituted one of those mysteries which did not interest him in the least. But this boy did interest him, and he seriously inquired: \n \n \"Why do you place Beethoven, in particular, at the head of all?\" \n \n \"Because he is more of an idealist than all the other musical composers put together.\" \n \n \"Really? Do you, also, take that as the true view of the world?\" \n \n [Pg 376] \n \n \"Undoubtedly. And I know that you are an extreme materialist,—\" explained Benkóvsky, and his eyes gleamed strangely. \n \n \"He wants to argue!\" thought Ippolít Sergyéevitch,—\"But he\u0027s a nice young fellow, straightforward, and, probably, strictly honorable.\" \n \n And his sympathy for this idealist, who was condemned to wear the dead man\u0027s slippers, increased. \n \n \"So, you and I are enemies?\"—he inquired, with a smile. \n \n \"Gentlemen!\"—Elizavéta Sergyéevna called to them from the room.—\"Don\u0027t forget that you have only just made each other\u0027s acquaintance....\" \n \n Másha, the maid, was setting the table, with a clatter of dishes, and she cast a furtive glance at Benkóvsky with eyes in which sparkled artless rapture. Ippolít also gazed at him, reflecting that he must treat this young fellow with all possible delicacy, and that it would be well to avoid \"ideal\" conversations with him, because he would, in all probability, get excited to the point of rage in arguments. But Benkóvsky stared at him with a burning glitter in his eyes, and a nervous quiver on his face.... Evidently, he was passionately anxious to talk, and he restrained his desire with difficulty. Ippolít Sergyéevitch made up his mind to confine himself to the bounds of strictly official courtesy. \n \n His sister, who was already seated at the table, tossed insignificant phrases, in a jesting tone, now to one, now to the other: the men made brief replies—one with the careless familiarity of a relative, the other with the respect of the lover. And all three were seized with a certain feeling of awkwardness and embarrassment, which made them keep watch over one another, and over themselves. \n \n [Pg 377] \n \n Másha brought the first course out on the terrace. \n \n \"Please come to dinner, gentlemen!\"—Elizavéta Sergyéevna invited them, as she armed herself with the soup-ladle.—\"Will you have a glass of vódka?\" \n \n \"Yes, I will!\"—said Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n \"And I will not, if you will excuse me,\" declared Benkóvsky. \n \n \"I willingly excuse you. But you will drink, will you not?\" \n \n \"I do not wish to....\" \n \n \"Touch glasses with a materialist,—\" thought Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n Either the savory soup with patties, or Ippolít Sergyéevitch\u0027s ceremonious manner seemed somewhat to cool and soften the sullen gleam of the young man\u0027s black eyes, and when the second course was served he began to talk: \n \n \"Perhaps my exclamation, in reply to your question, struck you as a challenge—are we enemies? Perhaps it is impolite, but I assume that people\u0027s relations to one another should be free from their official falsehood, which everyone has accepted as the rule.\" \n \n \"I entirely agree with you,\" answered Ippolít Sergyéevitch, with a smile.—\"The more simply, the better. And your straightforward declaration only pleased me, if you will permit me to express myself in that way.\" \n \n Benkóvsky smiled sadly, as he said: \n \n \"We really are enemies in the realm of ideas, but that defines itself at once, of itself. Now, you say—c the more simply, the better,\u0027 and I think so too, but I put one construction on those words, while you put another....\" \n \n \"Do we?\"—inquired Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n \"Undoubtedly, if you proceed in the straight line of logic from the views set forth in your article.\" \n \n [Pg 378] \n \n \"Of course I do....\" \n \n \"There, you see.... And from my point of view, your idea of simplicity would be coarse. But let us drop that question.... Tell me, in regarding life merely as a mechanism, which has worked out everything, including ideas, do not you feel conscious of an inward chill, and is there not in your soul a single drop of compassion for all the mysterious and enchantingly beautiful, which we degrade to simple chemistry, to a commingling of atoms of material?\" \n \n \"Hm!... I do not feel that chill, for my place is clear to me, in the great mechanism of life, which is more poetical than all fantasies.... As for the metaphysical fermentation of sentiment and mind, that, you know, is a matter of taste. So far, no one knows what beauty is. In any case, it is proper to assume that it is a physiological sensation.\" \n \n One talked in a low tone, full of pensiveness and sorrowful notes of pity for his erring interlocutor; the other spoke calmly, with a consciousness of his mental superiority, and with a desire not to employ words which wounded the vanity of his opponent—words which are so frequent in a discussion between two well-bred men, as to whose truth is the nearer to the real truth. Elizavéta Sergyéevna smiled slightly, as she watched the play of their countenances, and composedly ate her dinner, carefully gnawing the bones of her game. Másha peeped from behind the door, and, evidently, wished to understand what the gentlemen were saying, for her face wore a strained expression, and her eyes had become round, and lost their wonted expression of cunning and amiability. \n \n \"You say—actuality, but what is it, when everything around us, and we ourselves are merely chemistry and[Pg 379] mechanism, working without cessation? Everywhere motion, and everything is motion, and there is not the hundredth part of a second of rest.—How shall I seize actuality, how shall I recognize it, if I myself, at any given moment, am not what I was, am not what I shall be the following moment? You, I, we—are we merely material? But some day we shall lie beneath the holy pictures, filling the air with the vile stench of corruption.... All that will remain of us on earth will be, perhaps, some faded photographs, and they can never tell anyone about the joys and torments of our existence, which has been swallowed up by the unknown. Is it not terrible to believe that all we thinking and suffering beings live only for the purpose of decaying?\" \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch listened attentively to his speech, and said to himself: \n \n \"If you were convinced of the truth of your belief, you would be at ease. But here you are, shouting. And it is not because you are an idealist that you shout, my good fellow, but because you have weak nerves.\" \n \n But Benkóvsky, gazing into his face, with flaming eyes, went on: \n \n \"You talk about science,—very good!—I bow down before it as before a mighty power which will loose the bonds of the mystery that fetters me.... But by the light of it I behold myself on the same spot where stood my distant ancestor, who believed that the thunder rumbles thanks to the prophet Elijah. I do not believe in Elijah; I know that it is caused by the action of electricity, but how is that any clearer than Elijah? In that it is more complicated? It is as inexplicable as motion, and all the other powers, which people are unsuccessfully trying to substitute for one. And it sometimes seems to me, that the[Pg 380] entire business of science amounts to complicating conceptions—that is all! I think, that it is good to believe; people laugh at me, they say: \u0027It is not necessary to believe, but to know,\u0027 I want to know what matter is, and they answer me, literally, thus: \u0027Matter is what is contained in that locality of space, in which we render objective the cause of the sensations that we receive,\u0027 Why talk like that? Can that be given out as the answer to the question? It is a sneer at those who are passionately and sincerely seeking an answer to the anxious queries of their spirits.... I want to know the aim of existence—that aspiration of my spirit is also ridiculed. But I am living, life is not easy, and it gives me a right to demand a categorical answer from the monopolists of wisdom—why do I live?\" \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch cast a sidelong glance at the face of Benkóvsky, which was glowing with emotion, and recognized the fact that that young man must be answered with words which should correspond with his own words, in the matter of the strength of stormy feeling injected into them. But, while he recognized this fact, he felt within himself a desire to retort. But the poet\u0027s huge eyes grew still larger, a passionate melancholy burned within them. He sighed, and his white, elegant right hand, fluttered swiftly through the air, now convulsively clenched into a fist and menacing, now as though clutching at something in space, which it was powerless to grasp. \n \n \"But, while giving nothing, how much you have taken from life I You reply to that with scorn.... But in it rings—what? The impossibility of retorting with confidence, and, in addition, your inability to pity people. For men are asking from you spiritual bread, and you are offering them the stone of negation! You have stolen[Pg 381] the soul of life, and if there are in it no great feats of love and suffering, you are to blame for that, for, the slaves of reason, you have surrendered your soul into its power, and now it has turned cold, and is dying, ill and poverty-stricken! But life is just as gloomy as ever, and its torments, its woe, demand heroes.... Where are they?\" \n \n \"What a hysterical creature he is!\" exclaimed Ippolít Sergyéevitch to himself, as with an unpleasant shiver, he gazed at this little hall of nerves, which was quivering before him with melancholy excitement.—He tried to stem the stormy eloquence of his future brother-in-law, but did not succeed, for, possessed by the inspiration of his protest, the young man heard nothing and, apparently, saw nothing. He must have carried these complaints, which poured forth from his soul, about in him for a long time, and was glad that he could have his say to one of the men who, in his opinion, had ruined life. \n \n Elizavéta Sergyéevna admired him, screwing up her light eyes, and in them burned a spark of sensual desire. \n \n \"In all that you have so powerfully and beautifully said,—\" began Ippolít Sergyéevitch, in measured and amiable tones, taking advantage of the involuntary pause of the weary orator, and desirous of soothing him,—\"in all this there indisputably does ring much true feeling, much searching reason....\" \n \n \"What can I say to him that is chilling and conciliatory?—\" he said to himself, with renewed force, as he wove his web of compliments. \n \n But his sister rescued him from his trying situation. She had already eaten her fill, and sat there, leaning against the back of her chair. Her dark hair was arranged in antique fashion, but this coiffure, in the form of a diadem, was very becoming to the masterful expression of her[Pg 382] countenance. Her lips, quivering with laughter, displayed a strip of white teeth, as thin as the edge of a knife, and stopping her brother with a graceful gesture, she said: \n \n \"Permit me to say a word! I know an apothegm of a certain wise man, and it runs: \u0027Those are not in the right who speak—there is the truth, neither are they in the right who reply to them—that is a lie, but only Sabbaoth and Satan are right, in whose existence I do not believe, but who must exist somewhere, for it is they who have organized life in such a dual form, and it is life which has created them. You do not understand? Yet I am speaking the same human language as you are. But I compress the entire wisdom of the ages into one phrase, in order that you may perceive the nothingness of your wisdom.\" \n \n When she had finished her speech, she asked the men, with an enchantingly brilliant smile: \n \n \"What do you think of that?\" \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch shrugged his shoulders in silence,—his sister\u0027s words perturbed him, but he was delighted that she had curbed Benkóvsky. \n \n But something strange happened with Benkóvsky. When Elizavéta Sergyéevna began to speak, his face flamed with ecstasy, and, paling at every word she uttered, it expressed something akin to terror at the moment, when she put her question. He tried to make her some reply, his lips trembled nervously, but no words proceeded from them. And she, magnificent in her composure, watched the play of his face, and it must have pleased her to behold the effect of her words on him, for satisfaction beamed from her eyes. \n \n \"To me, at least, it seems as though the entire[Pg 383] sumtotal of huge folios of philosophy are contained in these words,\" she said, after a pause. \n \n \"You are right, up to a certain point,—\" said Ippolít Sergyéevitch, with a wry smile,—\"but, at the same time....\" \n \n \"So, is it possible that a man is bound to quench the last sparks of the Promethean fire which still burn in his soul, ennobling his strivings?—\" exclaimed Benkóvsky, gazing sadly at her. \n \n \"Why, if they yield anything positive ... anything agreeable to you!—\" she said, with a smile. \"It seems to me that you are taking a very dangerous criterion for the definition of the positive,—\" drily remarked her brother. \n \n \"Elizavéta Sergyéevna! You are a woman, tell me:—what echoes does the great intellectual movement of woman awaken in your soul?—\" inquired Benkóvsky, warming up again. \n \n \"It is interesting....\" \n \n \"Only that?\" \n \n \"But I think that it ... how shall I express it to you?.. that it is the aspiration of the superfluous women. They have remained outside the bulwarks of life, because they are homely, or because they do not recognize the power of their beauty, do not know the taste of power over men.... They are superfluous, from a mass of causes!... But—ice-cream is a necessity!\" In silence he took the little green dish out of her hands, and setting it in front of him, he began to stare intently at the cold, white mass, nervously rubbing his brow with his hand, which was trembling with suppressed emotion. \n \n \"There, you see that philosophy spoils not only the[Pg 384] taste for life, but even the appetite,—\" jested Elizavéta Sergyéevna. \n \n But her brother looked at her and thought, that she was playing an unworthy game with that boy. In him the whole conversation had evoked a dawning sensation of boredom, and, although he pitied Benkóvsky, this pity did not comprise any warmth of heart, and therefore it was devoid of energy. \n \n \"Sic visum Veneri!\"—he decided, as he rose from the table, and lighted a cigarette. \n \n \"Shall we play?\" Elizavéta Sergyéevna asked Benkóvsky. \n \n And when, in reply to her words, he bent his head submissively, they went from the terrace into the house, whence soon resounded the chords of the piano, and the sounds of a violin being tuned. Ippolít Sergyéevitch sat in a comfortable arm-chair near the railing of the terrace, protected from the sun by a lace-like curtain of wild grapevine, which had climbed from the ground to the roof on cords that had been strung for it, and heard everything which his sister and Benkóvsky said. \n \n \"Have you written anything lately?\"—inquired Elizavéta Sergyéevna, as she struck the note for the violin. \n \n \"Yes, a little piece.\" \n \n \"Recite it!\" \n \n \"Really, I do not wish to.\" \n \n \"Do you want me to entreat you?\" \n \n \"Do I? No.... But I should like to recite the verses which are now composing themselves within me....\" \n \n \"Pray do!\" \n \n \"Yes, I will recite them.... But they have only[Pg 385] just presented themselves.. and you have called them into life....\" \n \n \"How agreeable it is to me to hear that!\" \n \n \"I do not know.... Perhaps you are speaking with sincerity.... I do not know....\" \n \n \"Really, ought not I to go away?\"—thought Ippolít Sergyéevitch. But he was too indolent to move, and he remained, consoling himself with the thought that they must be aware of his presence on the terrace. \n \n \"Of thy calm beauty \n The cold gleam doth trouble me....\"[1] \n \n [1] These lines are very irregular, as to both rhyme and rhythm in the original. They are hardly of sufficient merit to warrant a poetical version.—Translator. \n \n rang out the low voice of Benkóvsky. \n \n \"Wilt thou laugh at my dreams? \n Thou understandest me not, perchance?\" \n \n mournfully inquired the youth. \n \n \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s rather late in the day for you to ask about that,\"—thought Ippolít Sergyéevitch, with a sceptical smile. \n \n \"In thine eyes there is no happiness, \n In thy words,—cold laughter do I hear. \n And strange to thee is the delirium mad I \n Of my soul....\" \n \n Benkóvsky paused, from emotion, or from lack of a rhyme. \n \n \"But it is so splendid! \n In it is a whirlwind of songs, in it is my life! \n [Pg 386]All permeated is it with stormy passion \n To solve the enigma of existence, \n To find for all men the road to happiness....\" \n \n \"I must go!—\" decided Ippolít Sergyéevitch, involuntarily brought to his feet by the young man\u0027s hysterical moans, in which simultaneously resounded a touching \"farewell!\" to the peace of his soul, and a despairing \"have mercy!\" addressed to the woman. \n \n \"Thy slave,—to thee I\u0027ve raised a throne \n In the madness of my heart.... \n And I await....\" \n \n \"Your ruin, for—sic visum Veneri!\"—Ippolít Sergyéevitch completed the verse, as he walked down the avenue through the park. \n \n He was astonished at his sister:—she did not seem handsome enough to arouse such love in the young man. She certainly must have effected it by the tactics of opposition. Then, one must acknowledge her steadfast bearing, for Benkóvsky was handsome.... Perhaps he, as her brother, and a well-bred man, ought to speak to her about the true character of her relations to this boy, glowing with red-hot passion? But to what could such a conversation lead, now? And he was not enough of an authority on matters of Cupid and Venus to meddle with this affair.... But, nevertheless, he must point out to Elizavéta the probable ruin of that gentleman, if he, with her aid, did not succeed in quenching pretty promptly the flame of his transports, and did not learn to feel more normally, and to argue in a more healthy manner. \n \n \"And what would happen, if that torch of passion were to flare up before Várenka\u0027s heart?\" \n \n But, after putting this question to himself, Ippolít[Pg 387] Sergyéevitch did not try to solve it, but began to wonder what the young girl was doing at that particular moment? Perhaps she was slapping her Nikon in the face, or rolling her sick father through the rooms in his arm-chair. And as he represented her to himself engaged in those occupations, he was offended, on her account. Yes, it was indispensably necessary to open the eyes of that girl, to actuality, to acquaint her with the intellectual tendencies of the day. What a pity that she lived so far away, and it was impossible to see her more frequently, so that, day by day, he might shake loose everything which barred off her mind from the action of logic! \n \n The park was full of stillness, and of fragrant coolness, from the house floated the singing sounds of the violin, and the nervous notes of the piano. One after another phrases of sweet entreaty, of tender summons, of stormy ecstasy were showered over the park. \n \n Music poured from heaven also—there the larks were singing. With rumpled plumage, and black as a piece of coal, a starling sat on a linden bough, and bristling up the feathers on his breast, he whistled significantly, staring sidewise at the meditative man, who was strolling slowly along the avenue, with his hands clasped behind his back, and staring far away into the distance, with smiling eyes. \n \n At tea, Benkóvsky was more reserved, and not so much like a crazy man; Elizavéta Sergyéevna, also seemed to be warmed up by something. \n \n On observing this, Ippolít Sergyéevitch felt himself guaranteed against the breaking out of any abstract discussions, and so felt less embarrassed. \n \n \"You tell me nothing about St. Petersburg, Ippolít,—\" said Elizavéta Sergyéevna. \n \n [Pg 388] \n \n \"What is there to say about it? It is a very large and lively city.... The weather is damp there, but....\" \n \n \"But the people are dry,\"—interrupted Benkóvsky. \n \n \"Not all of them, by any means. There are many who have grown perfectly soft, and are covered with the mould of very ancient moods; people everywhere are tolerably varied!\" \n \n \"Thank God that it is so!\" exclaimed Benkóvsky. \n \n \"Yes, life would be intolerably tedious if it were not so!\" assented Elizavéta Sergyéevna.—\"But in what favor does the country stand with young people. Are they still speculating on a fall in stocks?\" \n \n \"Yes, they are becoming somewhat disillusioned.\" \n \n \"That is a characteristic phenomenon for the educated class of our days,—\" said Benkóvsky, with a laugh.—\"When the majority of that class were of the nobility, it had no existence. But now-a-days, when the son of every low-born extortioner, merchant or official, who has read two or three popular little books, also belongs to the educated class,—the country cannot arouse the interest of such an \u0027intelligéntzia,\u0027[2] Do they know anything about it? Can it be for them anything except a good place in which to spend the summer? For them the country is a suburban villa ... and altogether, they are villa-residents, by virtue of the essential quality of their souls. They make their appearance, live on, and disappear, leaving behind them in life divers papers, bits, scraps—the usual traces of their sojourn, which villa-residents leave behind them in country fields. Others will follow after them and annihilate this rubbish, and with it the memory of the[Pg 389] ignominious, soulless and impotent educated people of these years of 1890.\" \n \n [2] The popular word for the class in question. I leave it untranslated here for the benefit of those who have already met with the word.—Translator. \n \n \"And are those others repaired noblemen?\" asked Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n \"You have understood me, apparently,... in a way that is far from flattering to you, if you will excuse me for saying so!\" Benkóvsky flared up. \n \n \"I merely inquired who these coming people are to be?\" replied Ippolít Sergyéevitch, shrugging his shoulders. \n \n \"They are—the young country! Its reformed generation, men who already possess the developed sentiment of human dignity, who thirst for knowledge, who are of an investigative turn of mind, ready to introduce themselves to notice.\" \n \n \"I welcome them in advance,\" said Ippolít Sergyéevitch indifferently. \n \n \"Yes, it must be confessed, that the country is beginning to produce a new impression on the world,—a conciliatory impression,\" remarked Elizavéta Sergyéevna.—\"I have here some very interesting children,—Iván and Grigóry Shákhoff, who have read almost half of my library, and Akim Sozyreff, a man \u0027who understands everything,\u0027 as he asserts. As a matter of fact, he has brilliant ideas! I put him to the test—I gave him a work on physics, and said to him—\u0027 read this, and explain to me the laws of the lever and of equilibrium and one week later, he passed my examination with so much effect, that I was simply astounded! And moreover, in reply to my commendations, he said: \u0027What of that? You understand this, consequently, no one forbids me to do the same-?—books are written for everybody!, What do you think of that? But you see ... their idea of their dignity has been[Pg 390] developed, so far, only to the point of insolence and churlishness. They apply these newly-born properties even to me, but I endure it, and do not complain to the county chief, because I understand what fiery flowers might blossom forth on that soil ... very likely, some fine morning, one might wake up with nothing but the ashes of one\u0027s manor left.\" \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch smiled. Benkóvsky glanced, sadly at the woman. \n \n Touching superficially on themes, and not attacking one another\u0027s vanity strongly, they conversed until ten o\u0027clock, and then Elizavéta Sergyéevna and Benkóvsky went off again to play, and Ippolít Sergyéevitch bade them good night and retired to his own room, observing that his future brother-in-law made not the slightest effort to conceal the satisfaction he felt at getting rid of his betrothed\u0027s brother. \n \n ... One discovers what he wishes to discover, and ennui makes its appearance, as though by way of reward for an investigative turn of mind. It was precisely this enervating sensation which Ippolít Sergyéevitch experienced, when he seated himself at the table in his chamber, with the intention of writing several letters to his acquaintances. He understood the motives of his sister\u0027s peculiar relations toward Benkóvsky, he understood, also, his r?le in her game. All this was not nice, but, at the same time, it was all foreign to him, in a way, and his soul was not disturbed by the parody on the story of Pygmalion and Galatea which was being enacted in his presence, although, in his mind, he condemned his sister. Tapping the handle of his pen, in a melancholy way, against the table, he turned down the light, and when the room was plunged in obscurity, he began to look out of the window. \n \n [Pg 391] \n \n Dead silence reigned in the park, which was illuminated by the moon, and through the window-panes, the moon had a greenish hue. \n \n Under the windows, a shadow flitted past, and vanished, leaving behind it a soft sound of rustling branches, quivering at the contact. Stepping to the window, Ippolít Sergyéevitch opened it, and looked out,—beyond the trees glimmered the white gown of Másha, the maid. \n \n \"What of that?\"—he said to himself, with a smile,—\"let the maid love, if the mistress is only playing at love.\" \n \n * \n \n Slowly the days vanished—drops of time in the boundless ocean of eternity—and they were all tediously monotonous. There were hardly any impressions, and it was difficult to work, because the sultry blaze of the sun, the narcotic perfumes of the park, and the pensive, moonlight nights, all aroused meditative indolence in the soul. Ippolít Sergyéevitch calmly enjoyed this purely-vegetable existence, postponing from day to day his resolve to set to work seriously. Sometimes he felt bored, he reproached himself for his inactivity, his lack of will, but all this did not arouse in him the desire to work, and he explained to himself his indolence as the effort of his organism to amass energy. In the morning, on awaking from a deep, healthy slumber, he noted, as he stretched himself luxuriously, how springy his muscles were, how elastic was his skin, and how deeply and freely his lungs breathed. \n \n The sad habit of philosophizing, which too frequently revealed itself in his sister, irritated him, at first, but he gradually became reconciled to this defect in Elizavéta Sergyéevna, and managed, so cleverly and inoffensively to demonstrate to her the inutility of philosophy, that[Pg 392] she grew more reticent. Her inclination to argue about everything produced an unpleasant impression on him—he perceived that his sister was arguing, not from a natural impulse to explain to herself her relation to life, but merely from a provident desire to destroy and overthrow everything which might perturb the cold repose of her soul. She had worked out for herself a scheme of practice, but theories only interested her in so far as they were able to smooth over before him her hard, sceptical, and even ironical relations toward life and people. Although Ippolít Sergyéevitch comprehended all this, he did not feel within him the slightest desire to reproach and shame his sister; he condemned her in his own mind, but there was not in it that something which would have permitted him to express aloud his condemnation, for, as a matter of fact, his heart was no warmer than his sister\u0027s. \n \n Thus, almost every time, after a visit from Benkóvsky, Ippolít Sergyéevitch promised himself that he would speak to his sister about her relations toward that young man, but he did not keep his promise, imperceptibly to himself refraining from meddling with that affair. For, as yet, no one could tell which would be the suffering side, when sound sense should awaken in that highly inflamed young man. And this would happen—the young man was blazing too violently, and must, infallibly, burn out. And his sister was bearing it firmly in mind, that he was younger than she, so there was no cause for anxiety on her score. But if she got her punishment—what then? That was quite proper, if life is just.... \n \n Várenka came frequently. They rowed on the river, together, or in company with his sister, but never with Benkóvsky; they strolled in the forest, and once they drove to a monastery, twenty versts away. The young girl[Pg 393] continued to please him, and to upset him with her odd remarks, but he always found her society agreeable. Her ingenuousness perplexed him, and restrained the man within him; the integrity of her nature aroused his amazement, but the simple-hearted straightforwardness with which she put aside everything wherewith he attempted to unsettle the peace of her soul, wounded his self-love. \n \n And more and more frequently did he ask himself: \n \n \"But is it possible that I have not sufficient energy to drive out of her head all these errors and stupidities?\" \n \n When he did not see her, he clearly felt the indispensable necessity of liberating her mind from abnormal paths, he imposed this necessity upon himself as an obligation, but when Várenka made her appearance—he did not exactly forget his resolve, but he never placed it in the foremost rank in his relations toward her. Sometimes he caught himself listening to her, exactly as though he were desirous of learning something from her, and he admitted that there was something about her which hampered the freedom of his mind. It happened, on occasion, that when he had ready prepared a retort which, by stunning her with its dearness and force, would have convinced her of the obviousness of her error,—he locked this retort up within him, as though afraid to utter it. When he caught himself at this, he thought: \n \n \"Can this proceed from lack of confidence in my truth?\" \n \n And, of course, he convinced himself of the contrary. Another reason why he found it difficult to talk to her was, that she hardly knew even the alphabet of the generally accepted views. It was necessary to begin at the foundations, and her persistent questions: \"why?\" and \"what for?\" constantly led him off into the thickets of abstractions,[Pg 394] where she understood absolutely nothing. One day, worn out with his contradictions, she set forth her philosophy to him in these words: \n \n \"God created me, like other people, in His own image and likeness ... which signifies, that everything I do, I do according to His will, and I live—as He wants me to.... Surely, He knows how I live? Well, and that is all there is to be said, and it is useless for you to try to pick a quarrel with me!\" \n \n More and more frequently did she irritate in him the glowing sensation of the male, but he kept watch on himself, and with swift efforts, which demanded from him constantly increasing consciousness, he extinguished in himself these flashes of sensuality, he even endeavored to conceal them from himself, and when he could no longer conceal them, he said to himself, with a guilty laugh: \n \n \"What of it?—That\u0027s natural ... considering her beauty.... But I am a man, and every day my organism is growing stronger under the influence of this sun and air.. It is natural, but her oddities completely guarantee me against being carried away by her....\" \n \n Season becomes incredibly active and pliable, when man\u0027s feeling requires a mask, behind which to hide the crude truth of his questions. Feeling, like every other power, straightforward and upright, when it is shattered by life, or broken by excessive efforts to restrain its outbursts with the cold bridle of reason, loses both uprightness and straightforwardness, and remains merely crude. And then, being in need of a screen for its weakness and coarseness, it betakes itself for aid to the great capacity which reason possesses of imparting to a lie the physiognomy of the truth. This capacity was well developed in Ippolít Sergyéevitch, and with its aid, he successfully[Pg 395] imparted to his attraction toward Várenka the character of interest in her, pure and free from all impulses. He would not have had the strength to love her,—he knew that, but in the depths of his mind there flashed up the hope of possessing her; without himself being aware of it, he expected that she would be captivated by him. And as he argued with himself about everything which did not lower him in his own eyes, he succeeded in concealing within himself everything which might have evoked in him a doubt as to his good breeding.... \n \n One day, at evening tea, his sister announced to him: \n \n \"Do you know—to-morrow is Várenka ólesoff\u0027s birthday. We must drive over there. I want to have a drive.... And it will be good for the horses, too.\" \n \n \"Do drive over ... and congratulate her on my behalf,—\" he said, feeling that he, also, would like to go. \n \n \"But will not you drive with me?—\" she inquired, glancing at him, with curiosity. \n \n \"I? I don\u0027t know whether I care to.... I think I don\u0027t. But I may go, all the same.\" \n \n \"It is not obligatory!—\" remarked Elizavéta Sergyéevna, and dropped her eyelids, to conceal the smile which gleamed in her eyes. \n \n \"I know that,—\" said he, displeased. \n \n A long pause ensued, during which Ippolít Sergyéevitch remarked to himself, with severity, that he was conducting himself toward that young girl exactly as though he were afraid that his self-control would not resist her charms. \n \n \"She told me—that Várenka—that they have a very beautiful site there,—\" he said, and turned scarlet, knowing that his sister understood him. But she did not betray this in any way—on the contrary, she began to persuade him. \n \n [Pg 396] \n \n \"Let us go, do, please! You will see, it really is magnificent at their place. And it will be less awkward for me if you are there.... We will not stay long, is that right?\" \n \n He assented, but his mood was spoiled. \n \n \"Why did I find it necessary to lie? What is there disgraceful or unnatural in my wanting to see a pretty young girl once more?—\" he asked himself angrily. And he made no reply to these questions. \n \n On the following morning, he awoke early, and the first sounds of the day which his ear caught, were his sister\u0027s words: \n \n .... \"Ippolít will be astonished!\" \n \n They were accompanied by a loud laugh—only Várenka could laugh like that. Ippolít Sergyéevitch, sitting up in bed, threw off the sheet, and listened, smiling the while. That which instantaneously invaded him and filled his soul could hardly be called joy, rather was it a foreboding of joy near at hand, which pleasantly titillated the nerves. And springing from his bed, he began to dress himself with a swiftness which confused and perplexed him. What had happened? Could it be that she, on her birthday, had come to invite him and his sister to her house? What a darling girl! \n \n When he entered the dining-room, Várenka dropped her eyes before him with a penitently-comical manner, and without taking the hand which he offered her, she began, in a timid voice: \n \n \"I am afraid, that you....\" \n \n \"Just imagine!—\" exclaimed Elizavéta Sergyéevna,—\"she has run away from home!\" \n \n \"What do you mean by that?\"—her brother asked her. \n \n \"On the sly—\" explained Várenka. \n \n [Pg 397] \n \n \"Ha, ha, ha!—\" laughed Elizavéta Sergyéevna. \n \n \"But ... why?\"—persisted Ippolít. \n \n \"I have run away from my suitors....\" the young girl confessed, and began to laugh also.—\"Imagine, what frightful faces they will make! Aunt Lutchítzky is awfully anxious to drive me into marriage!—she sent them solemn invitations, and cooked and baked as much for them as though I\u0027d had a hundred wooers! And I helped her do it ... but to-day I woke up, and jumped on my horse—and march! hither. I left them a note to say that I had gone to the Shtcherbákoffs ... you understand? twenty-three versts away, in exactly the opposite direction!\" \n \n He looked at her, and laughed, with a laugh which evoked a pleasing warmth in his breast. Again she was clad in a full, white gown, whose folds fell in tender streams from her shoulders to her feet, enveloping her body in a cloud, as it were. Clear laughter quivered in her eyes, and on her face played an animated flush. \n \n \"You do not like it?\"—she asked him. \n \n \"What?\"—he inquired briefly. \n \n \"What I have done? It was impolite, I understand that,—\" she said, becoming serious, and immediately burst out laughing again.... \n \n \"I can imagine them! All dressed up, scented ... they\u0027ll get drunk with grief—heavens, how drunk!\" \n \n \"Are there many of them?—\" asked Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n \"Four....\" \n \n \"The tea is poured!\" announced Elizavéta Sergyéevna. \n \n \"You will have to pay for this prank, Várya.... Have you thought of that?\" \n \n \"No ... and I don\u0027t want to!—\" she replied with[Pg 398] decision, as she seated herself at the table.—\"That will take place—when I return to them ... that is to say, this evening, for I\u0027m going to spend the day with you. Why should I think from morning on about what will not happen until the evening? And who can do anything to me, and what can they do? Papa? He will growl, but I can go away and not listen to, him.... Aunty?—she loves me passionately! They, do you think? Why, I can make them crawl round me on all fours ... ha, ha, ha! That would be ... ridiculous! I will try ... Tchernonéboff can\u0027t, because he has a big belly!\" \n \n \"Várya! You are losing your wits!\"—Elizavéta Sergyéevna endeavored to stop her. \n \n \"No, I shall not!—\" promised the girl through her laughter, but she did not stop soon, and kept on depicting her suitors, and captivating the brother and sister by the genuineness of her animation. \n \n Laughter resounded during the whole time they were drinking tea. Elizavéta Sergyéevna laughed with a tinge of condescension toward Várya. Ippolít Sergyéevitch tried to restrain himself, but could not. After tea, they began to discuss how they should fill up the day which had begun so merrily. Várenka suggested that they should row in the boat, to the forest, and drink tea there, and Ippolít Sergyéevitch immediately agreed with her. But his sister assumed a troubled expression, and announced: \n \n \"I cannot take part in that—I must drive to Sánino to-day, and cannot defer it. I had intended to drive to your house, Várya, and turn off there on the way ... but now it is necessary that I should make the trip expressly....\" \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch cast a suspicious glance at her—it struck him that she had that moment invented this, for[Pg 399] the purpose of leaving Várya alone with him. But her face expressed nothing except dissatisfaction and anxiety. \n \n Várenka was grieved by her words, but soon recovered her animation: \n \n \"Well, what of that? So much the worse for you ... and we\u0027ll go, all the same! Won\u0027t we? To-day I want to go far.... Only, see here—can Grigóry and Másha go with us?\" \n \n \"Grigóry can, of course! But Másha ... who will serve dinner?\" \n \n \"And who will eat the dinner? You are going to the Benkóvskys, we shall not return until evening.\" \n \n \"Very well, take Másha also.\" \n \n Várenka hurried off somewhere or other. Ippolít Sergyéevitch lighted a cigarette, went out on the terrace, and began to pace up and down it. This expedition charmed him, but Grigóry and Másha seemed to him superfluous. They would embarrass him—there was no doubt about that, and he would not be able to talk freely in their presence. \n \n Half an hour had not elapsed before Ippolít Sergyéevitch and Várya were standing by the boat, while around it bustled Grigóry—a red-haired, blue-eyed young fellow, with freckles on his face, and an aquiline nose. Másha, as she packed the samovár and the various bundles in the boat, said to him: \n \n \"Move quicker, you red-head; don\u0027t you see, the quality are waiting.\" \n \n \"Everything will be ready in a minute,\" replied the young fellow, in a high tenor voice, as he fastened the row-locks, and winked at Másha. \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch saw it, and divined who it was that had been flitting past his windows by night. \n \n [Pg 400] \n \n \"Do you know,—\" said Várya, as she seated herself in the boat, and indicated Grigóry by a nod,—\"he also has the reputation of being a learned man, with us.... He\u0027s a lawyer.\" \n \n \"You\u0027re just talking, Varvára Vasílievna,—\" laughed Grigóry, showing his strong white teeth.—\"A lawyer!\" \n \n \"Seriously, Ippolít Sergyéevitch, he knows all the Russian laws....\" \n \n \"Do you, really, Grigóry?\" asked Ippolít Sergyéevitch, with interest. \n \n \"The lady is joking ... the idea! Nobody knows them all, Varvára Vasílievna.\" \n \n \"And how about the person who wrote them?\" \n \n \"Mr. Speránsky? He died long, long ago....\"[3] \n \n [3] The well-known statesman, who influenced Alexander I between the years 1806 and 1812.—Speránsky, the son of a poor village priest, and socially (though not legally) on the level of the peasants, was educated at an ecclesiastical academy, and became the professor of mathematics and philosophy in the ecclesiastical school of St Alexander Névsky, in St. Petersburg. Thence his rise was as follows: he became the tutor of a nobleman\u0027s children; secretary to the Chancellor of the Imperial Council; Secretary of State. He was an ardent admirer of Napoleon I., as was Alexander I., and to this, no doubt, was due much of his influence over the Emperor. The Code Napoléon was his ideal of legislation, and formed the foundation for a scheme of reforms and laws which he carried into effect, in part. He thereby antagonized all classes of society: the aristocracy were offended by his boldness, which they resented in a man of such low extraction, the peasants were enraged by the increase in their taxes; and so forth. He was suddenly sent into polite exile, as the governor of Nizhni Nóvgorod Province, in March, 1812, but was speedily deprived of his office, and subjected to strict surveillance. Later on, for a couple of years, his exile took the form of the governorship of Siberia, whence he returned to St. Petersburg in 1821. But he never recovered his standing or influence. He had been created a Count by Alexander I., and, as the male line of his descendants died out, his descendants in the female line,—the Russian branch of the Princes Kantakiúzin (Cantacuzéne),—petitioned the Emperor, in 1872, for permission to add the title of \"Count Speránsky\" to their own title, which was granted.—Translator. \n \n \"Why, do you read?\"—inquired Ippolít Sergyéevitch, attentively scanning the intelligent, eagle-like face of the young man, who was lightly tossing the oars into the boat. \n \n \"And as for the laws, as she say,\"—and Grigóry indicated Várya with his bold eyes.—\"The tenth volume of them fell into my hands by accident ... I looked through it, and saw that it was interesting and necessary. I began to read.... And now I have the first volume....[Pg 401] The first article in it is so straight, and says: \u0027no one,\u0027 it says, \u0027can excuse himself through ignorance of the laws,\u0027 Well, so I thought to myself, that nobody does know them, and it isn\u0027t necessary for everybody to know them all.... And the teacher is soon going to get me the statutes about the peasants;—it\u0027s very interesting to read—and see what they are like....\" \n \n \"You see what he is?\"—inquired Várenka. \n \n \"And do you read much?—\" Ippolít Sergyéevitch pursued his inquiry, as he recalled Gógol\u0027s Petrúshka. \n \n \"I read, when I have time. There are a great many little books here.... Elizavéta Sergyéevna alone must have as many as a thousand. Only, hers are all romances, and various stories....\" \n \n The boat floated smoothly against the current, the shores moved to meet it, and all around was intoxicatingly beautiful: bright, still, fragrant. Ippolít Sergyéevitch gazed at Várenka\u0027s face, which was turned with curiosity toward the broad-chested rower, while the latter, cutting the mirror-like surface of the river in measured strokes, chatted about his literary tastes, content that the learned gentleman so gladly listened to him. Love and pride[Pg 402] beamed in the eyes of Másha, who was watching them from beneath her drooping lashes. \n \n \"I don\u0027t like to read about how the sun sets and rises ... and, in general, about nature. I have seen those sunrises more than a thousand times, I think.... I know all about the woods and the rivers, also; why should I read about them? But that sort of thing is in every book ... and, in my opinion, it\u0027s entirely superfluous.... Everybody understands the sunset after his own fashion.... And everybody has his own eyes for that purpose. But about the life of people—that\u0027s interesting. You read, and you say to yourself:—\u0027 and what would you do yourself, if you were placed on that line?\u0027 Although you know that the whole of it is false.\" \n \n \"What is false?\"—asked Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n \"Why, the little books. They\u0027re invented. About the peasant, for example.... Are they the sort of folks they appear in books? Everybody writes about them compassionately, and makes them out to be such petty fools ... it isn\u0027t well! Folks read, and think and, as a matter of fact, they can\u0027t understand the peasant ... because in the books he\u0027s ... terribly stupid, and bad....\" \n \n Várenka must have found these remarks tiresome, for she began to sing, in a low tone, as she gazed at the shores with dimming eyes. \n \n \"See here—Ippolít Sergyéevitch, let\u0027s get out and go on foot through the forest. But here we are, sitting and baking in the sun—is that the way to take a pleasure trip? Grigóry and Másha can row on to Savyóloff dell, land there, and prepare tea for us, and meet us.... Grigóry, bring the boat to the shore. I\u0027m awfully fond of eating and drinking in the forest, in the air, in the sunshine.... One, somehow, feels like a free vagabond....\" \n \n \"There, you see,\" she said, with animation, as she[Pg 403] sprang from the boat upon the sandy shore,—\"you touch earth, and immediately there is something which ... raises the soul in revolt. Here I\u0027ve got my boots full of sand ... and have wet one foot in the water.... That\u0027s unpleasant and pleasant, that means—it is good, because it makes one feel oneself.... Look, how swiftly the boat has moved on!\" \n \n The river lay at their feet, and disturbed by the boat, it plashed softly against the shore. The boat flew, like an arrow, in the direction of the forest, leaving behind it a long wake, which glittered like silver in the sunlight. They could see that Grigóry was laughing, as he looked at Másha, while she was threatening him with her fist. \n \n \"That\u0027s a pair of lovers,\"—remarked Várenka, with a smile;—\"Másha has already asked Elizavéta Sergyéevna\u0027s permission to marry Grigóry. But Elizavéta Sergyéevna will not allow it, for the present; she does not like married servants. But Grigóry\u0027s term of service ends in the autumn, and then he\u0027ll take Másha away from you ... They\u0027re both splendid people. Grigóry is begging me to sell him a small plot of ground to be paid for in instalments ... or to let him have it on a long lease ... he wants ten desyatinas. But I cannot, as long as papa is alive, and it\u0027s a pity ... I know that he would pay me all, and very punctually ... he\u0027s a good hand at everything ... a locksmith, and a blacksmith, and he\u0027s serving at your place as under-coachman.... Kokóvitch—the county chief, and my suitor—says this to me about him: 6 that\u0027s a dangerous beast, do you know—he doesn\u0027t respect his superiors!\u0027\" \n \n \"Who is that Kokóvitch? A Pole?\"[4]—inquired Ippolít Sergyéevitch, admiring her grimaces. \n \n [4] Várenka has mimicked Kokóvitch\u0027s pronunciation, which leads to this question.—Translator. \n \n [Pg 404] \n \n \"A Mordvinian, a Tchuvásh—I don\u0027t know! He has a frightfully long and thick tongue, there isn\u0027t room for it in his mouth, and it interferes with his speech.... Ugh! What mud!\" \n \n Their path was blocked by a puddle of water covered with green scum, and surrounded by a border of greasy mud. Ippolít Sergyéevitch inspected his feet, remarking: \n \n \"We must go around it.\" \n \n \"Aren\u0027t you going to jump over it? I thought it was already dried up....\" exclaimed Várenka, indignantly, stamping her foot.... \"It is a long way round, and then, I shall tear my gown there.... Try to leap across it! It\u0027s easy, see—o-one!\" \n \n She sprang, and flung herself forward; it seemed to him that her gown had been tom from her shoulders, and was fluttering through the air. But she stood on the other side of the puddle, and cried, with regret: \n \n \"A?, how I have spattered myself! Ho, do you go round it ... fie, how horrid!\" \n \n He looked at her, and smiled wanly, catching within him a dark thought which stimulated him, and feeling that his feet were sinking into the sticky dampness. On the other side of the mud, Várenka was shaking her gown, it emitted a soft rustle, and amid its fluttering, Ippolít Sergyéevitch caught sight of dainty, striped stockings on the well-formed little feet. For an instant, it seemed to him as though the mud which separated them from each other, held a sense of warning for him or for her. But he roughly tore himself away, calling this prick in the heart stupid childishness, and hastily stepped aside from the road, into the bushes which bordered it, where, nevertheless, he was obliged to walk through water concealed by the grass. With wet feet, and a resolve which was not yet[Pg 405] clear to himself, he emerged beside her, and she, showing him her gown, with a grimace, said: \n \n \"Look at that—is that nice? Bah!\" \n \n He looked—large, black spots smote the eye, as they triumphantly decorated the white material. \n \n \"I love, and am accustomed to behold thee so sacredly pure, that even a spot of mud on thy gown would cast a black shadow on my soul ...\" said Ippolít Sergyéevitch slowly, and ceasing, he began to gaze into the astonished face of Várenka with a smile hovering over his lips. Her eyes rested questioningly on his face, but he felt as though his breast were filling up with burning froth, which was on the point of being converted into wondrous words, such as he had never yet uttered to anyone, for he had never known them until that moment. \n \n \"What was that you said?\"—inquired Várenka firmly. \n \n He shuddered, for her question sounded stem, and endeavoring to be calm, he began seriously to explain to her: \"I was reciting verses ... in Russian they sound like prose ... but you hear that they are verses, do you not? They are Italian verses, I think ... really, I do not remember.... However, perhaps it was prose, from some romance.... It just happened to come into my head....\" \n \n \"How did it go—say it again?\" she asked him, suddenly becoming thoughtful. \n \n \"I love....\" he paused, and wiped his brow with his hand.—\"Will you believe it? I have forgotten what I said! On my word of honor—I have forgotten!\" \n \n \"Well ... let us go on!—\" and she moved forward with decision. \n \n For several minutes Ippolít Sergyéevitch tried to understand and explain to himself this strange scene, which[Pg 406] had placed between him and the young girl a barrier of mutual distrust—tried, and could get nothing out of himself, except a consciousness of awkwardness before Várenka. She walked by his side, in silence, and with bowed head, not looking at him. \n \n \"How am I to explain it all to her?\" Ippolít Sergyéevitch reflected. \n \n Her silence was crushing; it seemed as though she were thinking of him, and not thinking well of him. And unable to devise any explanation of his outburst, he suddenly remarked, with forced cheerfulness: \n \n \"Your suitors ought to know how you are spending your time!\" \n \n She glanced at him, as though, by his words, he had called her back from somewhere far away, but gradually, her face changed from seriousness to simplicity, and an expression of childlike sweetness. \n \n \"Yes! It would—offend them! But they shall know, oh! they shall know! And, perhaps they ... will think ill of me!\" \n \n \"Are you afraid of that?\" \n \n \"I? Of them?—\" she inquired, softly but angrily. \n \n \"Pardon me for the question.\" \n \n \"Never mind.... You see, you do not know me ... you do not know how repulsive they all are to me! Sometimes I feel like hurling them under my feet, and trampling on their faces ... treading on their lips, so that they could not say anything. Ugh! How detestable they all are!\" \n \n Wrath and heartlessness sparkled so clearly in her eyes, that it made him uncomfortable to look at her, and he turned away, saying to her: \n \n \"How sad, that you are compelled to live among people[Pg 407] whom you detest.... Can it be, that there is not one among them who would ... strike you as well-bred....\" \n \n \"No! You know, there are frightfully few interesting people in the world.... Everybody is so stupid, so uninspired, so repulsive....\" \n \n He smiled at her complaint, and said with a touch of irony, which was incomprehensible even to himself: \n \n \"It is early yet for you to talk in that way. But wait a little, and you will meet a man who will satisfy you ... you will find him interesting in every way....\" \n \n \"Who is he?\"—she asked quickly, and even halted. \n \n \"Your future husband.\" \n \n \"But who is he?\" \n \n \"How can I know that?—\" Ippolít Sergyéevitch shrugged his shoulders, feeling displeased at the animation of her questions. \n \n \"But tell me!\"—she sighed, and moved on. \n \n They were walking through bushes, which barely reached their shoulders; the road ran through this underbrush, like a lost ribbon, all in capricious curves. Now, in front of them, the dense forest made its appearance. \"And do you wish to marry?\"—asked Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \"Yes.... I don\u0027t know! I\u0027m not thinking about that....\" she replied simply. The glance of her beautiful eyes, fixed on the far distance, was as concentrated as though she were recalling something far away and dear to her. \n \n \"You ought to spend the winter in town,—there your beauty would attract to you universal attention, and you would soon find what you want.... For many would strongly desire to call you their wife,—\" he said, slowly, in a low tone, as he thoughtfully scanned her figure. \n \n [Pg 408] \n \n \"It would be necessary that I should permit that!\" \n \n \"How can you forbid men to desire it?\" \n \n \"Ah, yes! Of course ... let them desire it....\" \n \n They walked a few steps in silence. \n \n She, pensively gazing into the distance, still was intent on recalling something, but he, for some reason, was counting the spots of mud on the front of her gown. There were seven of them: three large ones, which resembled stars, two, like commas in shape, and one, like a daub from a brush. By their black color, and their arrangement on the material, they signified something to him. But what—he did not know. \n \n \"Have you been in love?\"—her voice suddenly rang out, serious and searching. \n \n \"I?\"—shuddered Ippolít Sergyéevitch.—\"Yes ... only, it was long ago, when I was a young fellow....\" \n \n \"So have I, long ago,\" she informed him. \n \n \"Ah ... who was he?—\" inquired Polkánoff,[5] not conscious of the awkwardness of the question, and tearing off a branch which came under his hand, he flung it far away from himself. \n \n [5] It must be borne in mind that the surname is not used in Russian speech or novels nearly as often as the Christian name followed by the patronymic, which is more definite as to the precise individual, and the precise member of the family.—Translator. \n \n \"He? He was a horse-thief.... Three years have passed since I saw him last, I was seventeen years old then.... They caught him one day, beat him, and brought him to our court-yard. He lay there, bound with ropes, and said nothing, but looked at me.... I was standing on the porch of the house. I remember, it was such a bright morning—it was early in the morning, and everyone at our house was still asleep....\" \n \n [Pg 409] \n \n She paused, buried in her memories. \n \n \"Under the cart there was a pool of blood—such a thick pool—and into it fell heavy drops from him.... His name was Sáshka Rémezoff. The peasants came into the court-yard, and as they looked at him, they growled like dogs. All of them had evil eyes, but he, that Sáshka, stared at them all quite calmly.... And I felt that he—although he was beaten and bound—considered himself better than all of them. He looked so ... his eyes were large, and brown. I felt sorry for him, and afraid of him.... I went into the house, and poured him out a glass of vódka.... Then I went out and gave it to him. But his hands were bound, and he could not drink it ... and he said to me, raising his head a little—and his head was all covered with blood: \u0027Put it in my mouth, my lady,\u0027 I held it to his lips, and he drank so slowly, so slowly, and said: \u0027Thank you, my lady! God grant you happiness!\u0027—Then, all at once, I whispered to him: \u0027Run!\u0027 But he answered aloud:—\u0027If I live, I certainly will run. You may trust me for that!\u0027—And I was awfully pleased, that he had said it so loudly, that, everyone in the court-yard heard him. Then he said: \u0027My lady! Order them to wash my face!, I told Dúnya, and she washed it ... although his face remained blue and swollen from the blows ... yes! They soon carried him away, and when the cart drove out of the courtyard, I looked at him, and he bowed to me, and smiled with his eyes ... although he was very badly bruised.... How I wept for him! How I prayed to God that he might run away....\" \n \n \"Do you mean ...\" Ippolít Sergyéevitch ironically interrupted her,—\"that perhaps you are waiting for him to make his escape and present himself before you, and then ... you will marry him?\" \n \n [Pg 410] \n \n She either did not hear or did not understand the irony, for she answered simply: \n \n \"Well, and why should he show himself here?\" \n \n \"But if he did—would you marry him?\" \n \n \"Marry a peasant? I don\u0027t know ...? no, I think not!\" \n \n Polkánoff waxed angry. \n \n \"You have ruined your brain with your romances, that\u0027s what I have to say to you, Varvára Vasílievna.—\" he remarked severely. \n \n At the sound of his harsh voice, she glanced at his face with amazement, and began, silently and attentively, to listen to his stem, almost castigating words. And he demonstrated to her, how that literature which she loved depraved mind and soul, always distorted reality, was foreign to ennobling ideas, was indifferent to the sad truth of life, to the desires and tortures of mankind. His voice rang out harshly in the silence of the forest which surrounded them, and frequently, in the wayside branches, a timorous rustling resounded—some one was hiding there. From the foliage fragrant twilight peered forth upon the road, now and then, athwart the forest, a prolonged sound was wafted, which resembled a stifled sigh, and the foliage quivered faintly, as in slumber. \n \n \"You must read and respect only those books which teach you to understand the meaning of life, to understand the aspirations of men, and the true motives of their actions. To understand people means,—to pardon them their defects. You must know how badly people live, and how well they might live, if they were only more sensible, and if they paid more respect to the rights of one another. For, of course, all men desire one thing—happiness, but they proceed toward it by different paths, and those paths[Pg 411] are, sometimes, very ignominious, but that is only because they do not understand in what happiness consists. Hence, it is the duty of all practical and honest literature, to explain to men in what happiness consists, and how to attain to it. But those books which you read, do not occupy themselves with such problems.. they merely lie, and lie crudely. Here, they have inculcated in you ... an uncivilized notion of heroism.. And what is the result? Now you will be seeking in life such people as those in the books....\" \n \n \"No, of course I shall not!...\" said the young girl seriously.—\"I know that there are no such men. But the books are nice precisely for the reason that they depict that which does not exist. The commonplace is everywhere ... all life is commonplace.... There is a great deal said about suffering.... That certainly is false, but if it is false—why is it not a good thing to say a great deal about that of which there is so little! Here, you say, that in books one must seek?... exemplary feelings and thoughts,... and that all men err, and do not understand themselves.... But, surely, the books are written by men, also! And how am I to know what I ought to believe, and what is best? And in those books, which you assail, there is a great deal that is noble....\" \n \n \"You have not understood me....\" he exclaimed, with vexation. \n \n \"Really? And you are angry with me for that?—\" she asked, in a penitent tone. \n \n \"No! Of course, I am not angry ... as if there could be any question of such a thing!\" \n \n \"You are angry, I know it, I know it! For, you see, I always get provoked myself, when people do not agree with[Pg 412] me! But why do you find it necessary that I should agree with you? And I think, also.... In general, why does everybody always quarrel and insist that others should agree with them? Then there would be nothing whatever to talk about.\" \n \n She laughed, and in the midst of her laugh, she concluded: \n \n \"It\u0027s exactly as though everybody wanted to have only one word left out of all the words—\u0027yes!\u0027 It\u0027s awfully amusing!\" \n \n \"You ask, why I find it necessary....\" \n \n \"No, I understand; you have got used to teaching, so you regard it as indispensable that no one should impede you with objections.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s not so at all!—\" exclaimed Polkánoff bitterly.—\"I wish to arouse in you the faculty of criticising everything that goes on around you, and in your own soul.\" \n \n \"Why?\"—she inquired, ingenuously looking him straight in the eye. \n \n \"Good heavens! What do you mean by \u0027why\u0027? In order that you may know how to scrutinize your emotions, your thoughts, your actions.. in order that you may bear yourself reasonably toward life, toward yourself.\" \n \n \"Well, that must be ... difficult. To scrutinize oneself, to criticise oneself.. what for? And how is it to be done? Am I to split myself in two, pray? I don\u0027t understand at all! You make it out, that truth is known to you alone.... Let us assume that I know some truth, and that everybody else knows some.... But, it appears, everyone is mistaken! For you say, that truth is one for all men, don\u0027t you?... But look—see what a beautiful glade!\" \n \n He gazed, and made no reply to her words. Within[Pg 413] him raged a feeling of dissatisfaction with himself, for his reason had been insulted by this girl, who would not yield to his efforts to subdue her, to bring her thoughts to a halt even for a moment, and then turn her into the right road, directly opposed to the one along which she had been proceeding up to this time, without encountering any opposition. He had become accustomed to regard as stupid those people who did not agree with him; at best, he set them down as devoid of the capacity of development beyond that point, on which their mind already stood,—and toward such people, he always bore himself with disdain, mingled with compassion. But this young girl did not strike him as stupid, and did not arouse in him his customary sentiments toward his opponents. Why was this so, and what was she? And he answered himself: \"Undoubtedly merely, because she was so stunningly handsome.... Her wild speeches might, really, not be regarded as a fault ... simply because they were original, and originality, on the whole, is rarely met with, especially in women.\" \n \n As a man of lofty culture, he outwardly bore himself toward women as beings who were mentally his equals, but in the depths of his own soul, like all men, he thought of women sceptically and with irony. In the heart of man there is much space for faith, but very little for conviction. \n \n They strolled slowly across the broad, almost perfectly circular glade. The road cut across it, in two dark lines of wheel-ruts, and disappeared again in the forest. In the centre of the glade, stood a small clump of graceful young birch-trees, casting lace-like shadows on the blades of the mown grass. Not far away from them, a half-ruined hut, constructed of branches, bowed toward the[Pg 414] earth; inside it one could catch a glimpse of hay, and on it perched two daws. To Ippolít Sergyéevitch they appeared entirely unnecessary and absurd, in the midst of this tiny, lovely wilderness, surrounded on all sides by the dark walls of the mysteriously mute forest. But the daws cast sidelong glances at the people who were walking along the road, and in their attitude there was a certain fearlessness and confidence,—as though, perched there upon the hut, they were guarding the entrance to it, and were conscious that they were thereby discharging their duty. \n \n \"Are not you fatigued?\"—inquired Polkánoff, with a feeling akin to anger, as he stared at the daws, pompous and sullen in their immobility. \n \n \"I? Fatigued with walking? It is a downright insult to hear that! Moreover, it is not more than one verst further to the place where they are awaiting us ... we shall enter the forest in a moment, and the road runs down hill.\" \n \n She told him how beautiful was the spot which was their goal, and he felt that a soft, agreeable indolence was taking possession of him, which prevented his paying due heed to her remarks. \n \n \"It is a pine forest there, and stands on a hillock, and is called Savyóloff\u0027s Crest. The pine-trees are huge, and there are no branches on their boles, except that away up aloft, each one has a dark-green canopy. It is quiet in that forest, even painfully quiet, the ground is all carpeted with pine needles, and the forest seems to have been swept up neatly. When I ramble in it, I always think of God, for some reason or other ... it must be awe-inspiring like that around His throne ... and the angels do not sing praises to Him—that is not true! What need[Pg 415] has He of praises? Does not He know of Himself how great He is?\" \n \n A brilliant thought flashed through Ippolít Sergyéevitch\u0027s mind: \n \n \"What if I were to take advantage of dogma, to plough up the virgin soil of her soul?\" \n \n But he instantly, and proudly rejected this involuntary confession of his weakness before her. It would not be honorable to employ a force, in whose existence he did not believe. \n \n \"You ... do not believe in God?\"—she inquired, as though divining his thought. \n \n \"What makes you think that?\" \n \n \"Why ... none of the learned men do believe....\" \n \n \"None of them, indeed!\" he laughed, not caring to talk to her on that subject. But she would not let him off. \n \n \"Isn\u0027t it true that all are unbelievers? But how is it that they do not believe? Please to tell me about those who do not believe in Him at all.... I do not understand how that can be. Whence has all this made its appearance?\" \n \n He paused, arousing his mind, which had fallen into a sweet doze beneath the sounds of her voice. Then he began to talk about the origin of the world, as he understood it: \n \n \"Mighty, unknown powers are eternally moving, coming into conflict, and their vast movement gives rise to the world which we see, in which the life of thought and of the grass-blade are subjected to the same, identical laws. This movement had no beginning, and will have no end....\" \n \n The young girl listened attentively to him, and[Pg 416] frequently asked him to explain one point or another. He explained with pleasure, perceiving the tension of thought in her face. She was thinking, thinking! But when he had finished, she asked him ingenuously, after pausing for a minute: \n \n \"So it was not begun from the beginning! But in the beginning was God. How is that? There is simply no mention of Him there, and can that be what is meant by not believing in Him?\" \n \n He wanted to retort, but he understood, from the expression of her face, that that was useless at the moment. She was a believer—to that her eyes, which were blazing with mystical fire, bore witness. Softly, timidly, she told him something strange. He did not catch the beginning of her speech. \n \n \"When you look at people, and see how hateful everything about them is, and then remember God and the Last Judgment—your heart fairly contracts! Because, assuredly, He can demand an accounting at any time-to-day, to-morrow, an hour hence.... And, you know, it sometimes seems to me—that it will be soon! It will be by day ... and first the sun will be extinguished ... and then a new flame will flash up, and in it He will appear.\" \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch listened to her ravings, and said to himself: \n \n \"She possesses everything except the one thing which she ought to have....\" \n \n Her remarks called forth pallor on her face, and there was terror in her eyes. In this low-spirited condition she walked on for a long time, so that the curiosity with which Ippolít Sergyéevitch had been listening to her, began to die out, and give place to weariness. \n \n [Pg 417] \n \n But her delirium suddenly vanished, when a loud laugh was wafted to their ears, as it rang out somewhere in the immediate vicinity. \n \n \"Do you hear that? It is Másha ... We have arrived!\" \n \n She hastened her pace, and shouted: \n \n \"Másha, á-oo!\" \n \n \"Why does she shout?\" thought Ippolít Sergyéevitch compassionately. \n \n They emerged upon the bank of the river; it sloped down to the water, and on it cheerful clumps of birch-trees and aspens were capriciously scattered. And on the opposite shore, at the very water\u0027s edge, stood the lofty, silent pines, filling the air with their heavy, resinous fragrance. There everything was gloomy, motionless, monotonous, and permeated with stem dignity, but on this side—the graceful birch-trees rocked their supple branches to and fro, the silvery foliage of the aspens quivered; the wild snow-ball, and hazel bushes stood in luxuriant masses, reflected in the water; yonder the sand gleamed yellow, sprinkled with reddish pine-needles; here, under their feet, the second growth of grass, barely peeping forth from among the shorn stalks, showed green, and the scent of new-mown hay emanated from the haycocks which had been tossed up under the trees. The river, calm and cold, reflected like a mirror these two worlds, so unlike one to the other. \n \n In the shade of a group of birches a gay-colored rug had been spread, on it stood the samovár, emitting clouds of steam and blue smoke, and beside it, squatting on her heels, Másha was busying herself, teapot in hand. Her face was red and happy, her hair was damp. \n \n \"Have you been in bathing?\" Várenka asked her, \"And where is Grigóry?\" \n \n [Pg 418] \n \n \"He has gone to take a bath also. He\u0027ll soon be back.\" \n \n \"Well, I don\u0027t want him. I want to eat, drink, and ... eat and drink! That I do! And how about you, Ippolít Sergyéevitch?\" \n \n \"I shall not refuse, you know,—\" he laughed. \n \n \"Be quick, Másha!\" \n \n \"What do you command first? Chicken, the pasty....\" \n \n \"Serve everything at once, and you may disappear! Perhaps someone is waiting for you?\" \n \n \"Just nobody at all,\" smiled Másha softly, gazing at her with grateful eyes. \n \n \"Well, all right, go on pretending!\" \n \n * \n \n \"How simply she says all that,\" thought Ippolít Sergyéevitch, attacking the chicken.—\"Can it be that she is acquainted with the sense and the details of such relations? Very likely, seeing that the country is so frank and coarse in that sphere.\" \n \n But Várenka, with a laugh, jested away to the confusion of Másha, who stood before her with downcast eyes, and with a smile of happiness on her face. \n \n \"Wait, he\u0027ll take you in hand!\"—she threatened. \n \n \"Of co-ourse! And I shall give myself to him!... I ... you know ... I put him....\" and covering her face with her apron, she rocked to and fro, in a fit of uncontrollable laughter.—\"On the way, I pushed him into the water!\" \n \n \"Did you! That\u0027s a clever girl! And what did he do?\" \n \n \"He swam after the boat.. and ... and he kept beseeching me, to ... let him ... into the boat ... but I ... flung him ... a rope, from the stern!\" \n \n The infectious laughter of the two women forced[Pg 419] Ippolít Sergyéevitch to burst into laughter also. He laughed not because he imagined to himself Grigóry swimming after the boat, but because it did him good to laugh. A sensation of freedom from himself pervaded him, and, now and then, he seemed to be surprised at himself from somewhere in the distance, that he had never before been so simply joyous as at that moment. Then Másha vanished, and again they remained alone together. \n \n Várenka half reclined on the rug, and drank tea, while Ippolít Sergyéevitch gazed at her, as through the mist of dreams. Around them reigned stillness, only the samovár hummed a pensive melody, and, from time to time, something rustled in the grass. \n \n \"What makes you so taciturn?\" inquired Várenka, casting an anxious glance at him. \"Perhaps you are bored?\" \n \n \"No, I\u0027m enjoying myself,\" he said slowly, \"but I don\u0027t feel like talking.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s the way I feel, too,\" and the girl grew animated,—\"when it is still, I don\u0027t like at all to chatter. For with words you cannot say much, because there are feelings for which there are no words at all. And when people say—\u0027silence,\u0027 it is nonsense:—one cannot speak of silence without destroying it,... can one?\" \n \n She paused, gazed at the pine forest, and pointing at it with her hand, she said, with a quiet smile: \n \n \"See, the pines seem to be listening to something. There, among them, it is still, so still. Sometimes it seems to me that the best way to live is like that, in silence. But it is fine, too, in a thunderstorm ... akh, how fine! The sky is black, the lightning is vicious, it is dark, the wind roars.. at such times I feel like going out into the fields, and standing there, and singing—singing[Pg 420] loudly, or running through the rain, against the wind. It\u0027s the same in winter. Do you know, I once got lost in a snow-storm and came near freezing to death.\" \n \n \"Tell me, how that happened,\" he requested her. He found it pleasant to listen to her,—it seemed as though she were talking in a language which was new to him, although comprehensible. \n \n \"I was driving from the town, late at night,\" she began, moving nearer to him, and fixing her softly-smiling eyes upon his face.—\"The coachman was Yákoff, such a stem old peasant. And the snow-storm began, a snow-storm of terrible force, and blew straight in our faces. The wind came in gusts, and hurled a whole cloud of snow on us, so that the horses backed, and Yákoff reeled on the box. Everything around seethed as though in a kettle, and we were in a cold foam. We drove and drove, and then I saw Yákoff take his cap from his head and cross himself. \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027—\u0027Pray, my lady, to the Lord and to Varvára the Great Martyr, she will help against sudden death.\u0027 He spoke simply, and without fear, so that I was not frightened: I asked—\u0027Have we lost our way?\u0027—\u0027Yes,\u0027 said he.—\u0027But perhaps we shall escape?\u0027—\u0027How are we to escape, in such a blizzard! Now, I\u0027m going to let go of the reins, and perhaps the horses will find the way themselves; but do you call God to mind, all the same!\u0027 He is very devout, that Yákoff. The horses halted, and stood still, and the snow drifted over us. How cold it was! The snow cut our faces. Yákoff moved from the box, and sat beside me, so that both of us might be warmer, and we put the rug that was in the sledge over our heads. I sat there and thought: \u0027Well, I am lost! And I shall not eat the bonbons I have brought from the town....\u0027 But I was not afraid, because Yákoff kept[Pg 421] talking all the while. I remember that he said: \u0027I\u0027m sorry for you, my lady![6] \u0027Why should you perish?—\u0027 \u0027Why, you will be frozen also?—\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m of no consequence, I\u0027ve lived my life, but here are you ...\u0027 and he kept on about me. He is very fond of me, he even scolds sometimes, you know, growls at me, he\u0027s so cross-grained:—\u0027akh, you impious creature, you mad-cap, you shameless weathercock!...\" \n \n [6] Bárynya, for a married woman of noble birth, báryshmsya, for an unmarried woman, are more nearly equivalent to \"mistress\" and \"young mistress.\" But these are inconvenient, in many instances. In general, they are used precisely as \"my lady\" is used by English people of the lower class to those of superior rank.—Translator. \n \n She assumed a surly mien, and spoke in a deep bass voice, drawling out her words. The memory of Yákoff had diverted her from her story, and Ippolít Sergyéevitch was obliged to ask her: \n \n \"And how did you find the road?\" \n \n \"Why, the horses got chilled, and started ahead of their own accord, and they went on, and on until they reached a village thirteen versts away from ours. You know, our village is near here, about four versts distant. If you were to go along the shore, and then by the footpath, through the forest, to the right, you would come upon a hollow, and our home-farm would be in sight. But by the highway, it is ten versts from here.\" \n \n Several saucy birds hovered around them, and perching upon the branches of the bushes, twittered valiantly, as though imparting to one another their impressions concerning these two persons, alone there in the heart of the forest. From afar laughter, talking and the splash of oars was wafted to them,—probably from Grigóry and Másha as they rowed on the river. \n \n [Pg 422] \n \n \"Suppose we call them, and go in that direction, among the pines?\"—suggested Várenka. \n \n He assented, and placing her hand to her mouth like a trumpet, she began to shout: \n \n \"Row thi-is wa-ay!\" \n \n Her bosom strained with the cry, and Ippolít Sergyéevitch admired her in silence. He had to think of some-thing—of something very serious, he felt,—but he did not wish to think, and this faint appeal of his mind did not prevent his calmly and freely resigning himself to the more powerful command of his feelings. \n \n The boat came in sight. Grigóry\u0027s face was sly and rather guilty; Másha\u0027s bore a fictitious expression of anger; but Várenka, as she took her seat in the boat, glanced at them, and laughed, and then they both began to laugh, confused and happy. \n \n \"Venus and her petted slaves,\" said Ippolít Sergyéevitch to himself. \n \n In the pine forest it was solemn and still as in a temple, and the mighty, stately tree-trunks stood like columns, supporting a heavy vault of dark verdure. A warm, heavy odor of resin filled the air, and under their feet the dry pine-needles crackled softly. In front, behind, on every side, stood the reddish pines, and only here and there, at their roots, through a layer of needles, did a pallid green force its way. In the stillness and in silence the two people strolled slowly amid this dumb life, turning now to the right, now to the left, to avoid trees which barred their path. \n \n \"We shall not go astray?\"—inquired Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n \"I go astray?\" said Várenka in surprise.—\"I can always, everywhere find the way I require ... all one has to do is to look at the sun.\" \n \n [Pg 423] \n \n He did not ask her how the sun pointed out the road to her, he did not, in the least, wish to speak, although he felt, at times, that he might say a very great deal to her. But these were internal impulses of desire, flashing up on the surface of his calm mood, and dying out again in a second, without agitating him. Várenka walked by his side, and on her face he beheld the reflection of quiet ecstasy. \n \n \"Is this nice?\" she asked him, now and then, and a caressing smile caused her lips to quiver. \n \n \"Yes, very,\" he replied briefly, and again they fell silent, as they roamed through the forest. It seemed to him that he was a young man, devoutly in love, a stranger to sinful intentions, and to all inward conflict with himself. But every time that his eyes fell upon the spots of mud on her gown, a disquieting shadow fell upon his soul. And he did not understand how this happened, that suddenly, all in a moment, when such a shadow enveloped his consciousness, with a deep sigh, as though casting off a weight, he said to her: \n \n \"What a beauty you are!\" \n \n She looked at him in amazement. \n \n \"What ails you? You have held your peace, held your peace—and then, suddenly, you say that!\" \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch smiled faintly, disarmed by her composure. \n \n \"It is so beautiful here.. you know! The forest is beautiful ... and you are like a fairy in it ... or, you are a goddess, and the forest is your temple.\" \n \n \"No,\" she replied, with a smile, \"it is not my forest, it belongs to the Crown, but our forest is yonder, down the river.\" \n \n And she pointed with her hand somewhere to one side. \n \n [Pg 424] \n \n \"Is she jesting, or ... does not she understand?—\" said Ippolít Sergyéevitch to himself, and a persistent desire to talk to her about her beauty began to blaze up within him. But she was pensive, calm, and this restrained him during the entire time of their stroll. \n \n They rambled on for a long time, but said little, for the soft, peaceful impressions of that day had breathed into their souls a sweet languor, in which all desires had sunk to rest, except the desire to meditate in silence upon something inexpressible in words. \n \n On their return home, they learned that Elizavéta Sergyéevna had not yet arrived, and they began to drink tea, which Másha hastily prepared. Immediately after tea, Várenka rode off homeward, having exacted from him a promise to come to their manor with Elizavéta Sergyéevna. He saw her off, and as he reached the terrace, he surprised in himself a mournful sensation of having lost something which was indispensable to him. As he sat at the table, whereon still stood his glass of tea, which had grown cold, he sternly tried to bring himself up short, to suppress this whole play of emotions excited by the day, but pity for himself made its appearance, and he rejected all operations on himself. \n \n \"Why?\" he said to himself—\"can all this be serious? It is a frolic, nothing more. It will not hurt her, it cannot hurt her, even if I wished it. It somewhat interferes with my life ... but there is so much that is young and beautiful about it....\" \n \n Then, smiling condescendingly to himself, he recalled his firm resolve to develop her mind, and his unsuccessful efforts to do so. \n \n \"No, evidently, one must use different words with her. These unadulterated natures are more inclined to yield[Pg 425] their directness to metaphysics ... defending themselves against logic by the armor of blind, primitive feeling.... She is a strange girl!\" \n \n His sister found him engrossed in thoughts about her. She made her appearance in noisy, animated mood,—such as he had not beheld her hitherto. After ordering Másha to boil the samovár, she seated herself opposite her brother, and began to tell him about the Benkóvskys. \"Forth from all the cracks of their ancient house peer the cruel eyes of poverty, which is celebrating its victory over that family. In the house, to all appearances, there is not a kopék of money, nor any provisions; they sent to the village to get eggs for dinner. There was no meat at dinner, and so old Benkóvsky talked a great deal about vegetarianism, and about the possibility of the moral regeneration of people on that basis. The whole place reeks of decay, and they are all bad-tempered—from hunger, probably.\" She had gone to them with the proposition that they should sell her a small plot of land which cut into her estate. \n \n \"Why did you do that?\" inquired Ippolít Sergyéevitch, with interest. \n \n \"Well, you can hardly appreciate the calculations which I am carrying out. Imagine—it is on account of my future children,—\" she said, laughing. \"Well, and how have you passed the time?\" \n \n \"Agreeably.\" \n \n She said nothing, but eyed him askance. \n \n \"Excuse me for the question ... aren\u0027t you a little bit afraid of being captivated by Várenka?\" \n \n \"What is there to fear?\" he inquired, with an interest which was incomprehensible to himself. \n \n \"The possibility of being strongly carried away?\" \n \n [Pg 426] \n \n \"Well, I am hardly capable of that..\" he replied sceptically, and he believed that he was speaking the truth. \n \n \"And if that is the case, it is very good indeed. A little—that is all well enough, but you are rather cold ... too serious.. for your years. And really.... I shall be glad if she stirs you up a little.... Perhaps you would like to see her more frequently?...\" \n \n \"She made me promise to go to their house, and begged you to do so....\" Ippolít Sergyéevitch informed her. \n \n \"When do you wish to go?\" \n \n \"It makes no difference to me ... Whenever you find it convenient. You are in good spirits to-day....\" \n \n \"Is that very noticeable?\"—she laughed.—\"What of it? I have passed the day pleasantly. On the whole ... I am afraid it will seem cynical to you ... but the truth is, that since the day of my husband\u0027s funeral, I feel that I am reviving to new life ... I am egotistical—of course! But it is the joyous egotism of a person who has been released from prison to freedom.... Condemn me ... but be just.\" \n \n \"How many accusations for such a short speech! You are glad and ... go on being glad....\" laughed Ippolít Sergyéevitch amiably. \n \n \"And you are kind and charming to-day,\" said she.—\"You see—a little happiness—and a person immediately becomes better, kinder. But some over-wise people think that sufferings purify us ... I should like to have life, by applying that theory to them, purify their minds from error....\" \n \n \"But if you were to make Várenka suffer—what would become of her?\" Ippolít Sergyéevitch asked himself. \n \n They soon parted. She began to play, and he, going off to his own room, lay down on his couch and began to[Pg 427] reflect,—what sort of an idea of him had that young girl formed? Did she consider him handsome? Or clever? What was there about him that could please her? Something attracted her to him—that was evident to him. But it was not likely that he possessed in her eyes any value as a clever, learned man; she so lightly brushed aside all his theories, views, exhortations. It was more probable that he pleased her simply as a man. \n \n And on arriving at this conclusion, Ippolít Sergyéevitch flushed with proud joy. Closing his eyes, with a smile of satisfaction, he pictured to himself this girl as submissive to him, conquered by him, ready to do anything for him, timidly entreating him to take her, and teach her to think, to live, to love. \n \n III. \n \n When Elizavéta Sergyéevna\u0027s cabriolet stopped at the porch of Colonel ólesoff\u0027s house, the tall, thin figure of a woman in a loose gray gown made its appearance, and a bass voice rang out, with a strong burr on the letter \"r\": \n \n \"A-ah! What a pleasant surprise!\" \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch even shivered at this greeting, which resembled a bellow. \n \n \"My brother Ippolít ...\" Elizavéta Sergyéevna introduced him, after she and the woman had kissed each other. \n \n \"Margarita Rodiónovna Lutchítzky.\" \n \n Five cold, sticky bones pressed Ippolít Sergyéevitch\u0027s fingers; flashing gray eyes were riveted on his face, and Aunt Lutchítzky boomed away in her bass voice, distinctly enunciating every phrase, as though she were counting them, and were afraid of saying too much. \n \n [Pg 428] \n \n \"I am very glad to make your acquaintance....\" \n \n Then she moved to one side, and laid her hand on the house-door. \n \n \"Pray, come in!\" \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch stepped across the threshold, and a hoarse cough and an irritated exclamation were borne to meet him from some quarter: \n \n \"Devil take your stupidity! Go along, see, and tell me, who-o has come....\" \n \n \"Go in, go in, Elizavéta Sergyéevna,\" urged on her brother, perceiving that he had halted, hesitatingly.—\"It\u0027s the colonel shouting ... It is we who have come, colonel!\" \n \n In the middle of a large room with a low ceiling, stood a massive arm-chair, and in it was squeezed a big, lymphatic body, with a red, wizened face, overgrown with gray moss. The upper part of this mass turned heavily, emitting a choking snort. Behind the arm-chair rose the shoulders of a tall, stout woman, who gazed into Ippolít Sergyéevitch\u0027s face with lack-lustre eyes. \n \n \"I\u0027m glad to see you ... is this your brother?... Colonel Vasíly ólesoff ... he beat the Turks and the Tekke Turkomans, and now he himself is conquered by diseases ... ho, ho, ho! I\u0027m glad to see you. Varvára has been drumming in my ears all summer about your learning, and all the rest of it ... Pray, come hither, into the drawing-room ... Thékla, push me in!\" \n \n The wheels of the chair squeaked piercingly, the colonel lurched forward, threw himself back, and broke into a hoarse cough, wagging his head about as though he wanted it to break off. \n \n \"When your master coughs—stand still! Haven\u0027t I told you that a thousand times?\" \n \n [Pg 429] \n \n And Aunt Lutchítzky, seizing Thékla by the shoulder, crushed her down to the floor. \n \n The Polkánoffs stood and waited, until the heavily swaying body of ólesoff should have finished coughing. At last they moved forward, and found themselves in a small room, where it was suffocating, dark and cramped with a superabundance of softly-stuffed furniture in canvas covers. \n \n \"Pray seat yourselves ... Thékla,—call your young mistress!\" commanded Aunt Lutchítzky. \n \n \"Elizavéta Sergyéevna, my dear, I am glad to see you!\" announced the colonel, staring at his guest from beneath his gray eyebrows which met over his nose, with eyes as round as those of an owl. The colonel\u0027s nose was comically huge, and its tip, purple and shining, mournfully hid itself in the thick brush of his whiskers. \n \n \"I know that you are as glad to see me as I am to see you....\" said his visitor caressingly. \n \n \"Ho, ho, ho! That\u0027s a lie—begging your pardon! What pleasure is there in seeing an old man, crippled with gout, and sick with an inexorable thirst for vódka? Twenty-five years ago, one might really have rejoiced at the sight of Váska ólesoff ... and many women did rejoice ... but now, I\u0027m utterly useless to you, and you\u0027re utterly useless to me.... But when you are here, they give me vódka—and so, I\u0027m glad to see you!\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t talk much, or you\u0027ll begin to cough again....\" Margarita Bodiónovna warned him. \n \n \"Did you hear?—\" the colonel turned to Ippolít Sergyéevitch.—\"I must not talk—it\u0027s injurious, I must not drink, it\u0027s injurious,—I must not eat as much as I want,—it\u0027s injurious! Everything is injurious, devil take it! And I see, that it\u0027s injurious for me to live! Ho, ho, ho! I[Pg 430] have lived too long ... I hope you may never have occasion to say the same thing about yourself.... However, you will certainly die early, you\u0027ll get the consumption,—you have an impossibly narrow chest....\" \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch looked, now at him, now at Aunt Lutchítzky, and thought of Várenka: \n \n \"And what monsters she lives among!\" \n \n He had never tried to depict to himself the setting of her life, and now he was crushed by what he beheld. The harsh, angular leanness of Aunt Lutchítzky offended his eyes; he could not bear to look at her long neck, covered with yellow skin, and every time she spoke he began to be apprehensive of something, as though in anticipation that the bass sounds, which emanated from this woman\u0027s broad bosom, flat as a board, would rend her breast. And the rustle of Aunt Lutchítzky\u0027s skirts seemed to him to be her bones rubbing against each other. The colonel reeked with some sort of liquor, sweat, and vile tobacco. Judging from the gleam in his eyes, he must often be in a fury, and Ippolít Sergyéevitch, as he imagined him in a state of exasperation, felt loathing for the old man. The rooms were not comfortable, the wall-paper was smoke-begrimed, and the tiles of the stoves were streaked with cracks, which, however, made them look like marble. The paint had been rubbed off of the floors by the wheels of the rolling-chair, the window-frames were awry, the panes were dull, everything breathed forth an odor of age, perishing with exhaustion. \n \n \"It is sultry to-day,...\" remarked Elizavéta Sergyéevna. \n \n \"There will be rain,\" declared Mrs. Lutchítzky categorically. \n \n \"Really?\" said the visitor doubtfully. \n \n [Pg 431] \n \n \"Trust to Margarita,—\" said the old man hoarsely.—\"She knows everything that will take place.... She assures me so every day.... \u0027You will die,\u0027 she says, \u0027and they will rob Várya, and break her head....\u0027—you see? I dispute it:—the daughter of Colonel ólesoff will not permit anyone to turn her head ... she\u0027ll do it herself; and that I shall die—is true.. that is to say, it is as it should be. And you, my learned gentleman, how do you feel yourself? A very small fish in a big tank?\" \n \n \"No, why should I? It is a beautiful wooded country ....\" replied Ippolít Sergyéevitch courteously. \n \n \"It is a beautiful wooded country here? Phew! That means that you haven\u0027t seen anything beautiful on earth. The valley of Kazanlik in Bulgaria is beautiful,... it is beautiful in Kherassan ... on the Murgal river there is a spot like paradise itself... Ah! My precious child!...\" \n \n Várenka brought with her an aroma of freshness into the musty atmosphere of the drawing-room. Her form was enveloped in some sort of mantle, of light lilac sarpinka.[1] In her hands she held a huge bouquet of freshly-gathered flowers, and her face was beaming with pleasure. \"How nice that you have come to-day!—\" she exclaimed, as she greeted her guests.—\"I was just preparing to go to you ... they have been nagging me!\" \n \n [1] Sarpinka is a very fine cotton goods, manufactured by German colonists, in the Government of Sarátoff, on the lower Vólga. It is almost invariably of two colors, like shot silk, is very durable and pretty.—Translator. \n \n And with a sweeping gesture, she designated her father and Margarita Rodiónovna, who was sitting beside her visitor with such unnatural rigidity, that her backbone seemed to have turned to stone, and to be incapable of bending. \n \n [Pg 432] \n \n \"Varvára! You\u0027re talking nonsense!\" she cried sternly to the young girl, with flashing eyes. \n \n \"Don\u0027t scream! If you do, I\u0027ll tell about Lieutenant Yákovleff, and his fiery heart....\" \n \n \"Ho, ho, ho! Várka[2]—be quiet! I\u0027ll tell it myself....\" \n \n [2] Várya, Várenka, Várka, are all diminutives of Varvára.—Translator. \n \n \"What sort of a place have I got into?\"—meditated Ippolít Sergyéevitch, gazing at his sister in amazement. \n \n But, evidently, all this was familiar to her, and although a smile of disdain quivered on the corners of her mouth, she looked on and listened with composure. \n \n \"I will go and see about tea!\"—announced Margarita Bodiónovna, stretching herself upward, without bending her body, and disappeared, after casting a glance of reproach at the colonel. \n \n Várenka sat down in her aunt\u0027s place, and began to whisper something in Elizavéta Sergyéevna\u0027s ear. \n \n \"Why has she such a passion for loose garments!\" said Ippolít Sergyéevitch to himself, casting a furtive glance at her figure, as it bent toward his sister, in a fine pose. But the colonel rumbled away, like a cracked double-bass: \n \n \"Of course, you are aware, that Margarita is the wife of my comrade, Lieutenant-Colonel Lutchítzky, who was killed at Iski-Zagra. She made the campaign with him, that she did! She\u0027s an energetic woman, you know. Well, and in our regiment there was a Lieutenant Yákovleff ... such a delicate young lady he was ... his chest was crushed by a Turkish volunteer, and consumption ensued, so that was the end of him! Well, and when he fell ill, she nursed him for five months! What do you think[Pg 433] of that? hey? And, do you know, she gave him her word that she would not marry. She was young, and handsome ... a very striking woman. Very worthy men courted her, courted her seriously—Captain Shmurló, a very fine young Little Russian, even took to drink and left the service. I, also ... that is to say, I also proposed to her:— \u0027Margarita! marry me!\u0027 ... She would not ... it was very stupid of her, but noble, of course. And then, when I was seized with the gout, she presented herself, and said: \u0027You are alone in the world, I am alone ...\u0027 and so forth and so on. Touching and saintly. Eternal friendship, and we snarl at each other all the time. She comes here every summer, she even wants to sell her estate and settle down here forever, that is to say, until I die. I appreciate it—but it\u0027s all ridiculous, isn\u0027t it? Ho, ho, ho! For she was a passionate woman, and you see how he has dried her up? Don\u0027t play with fire ... ho! She flies into a rage, you know, when one narrates this poetry of her life, as she expresses it. \u0027Don\u0027t you dare,\u0027 says she, \u0027to insult the holy things of my heart with your abominable tongue!\u0027 Ah! Ho, ho, ho! But, as a matter of fact, what sort of a holy thing is it? A delusion of the mind ... the dreams of a school-girl.... Life is simple, isn\u0027t it? Enjoy yourself, and die when your time comes, that\u0027s the whole philosophy! But ... die when your time comes! But here now, I have overlived the right time, I hope you won\u0027t do that....\" \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch\u0027s head was reeling with the story, and the odor which emanated from the colonel. But Várenka, paying no heed whatever to him, and, probably, not comprehending how little agreeable the conversation with her father was to him, was chatting, in a low tone, with Elizavéta Sergyéevna, listening seriously and attentively to her. \n \n [Pg 434] \n \n \"I invite you to drink tea!—\" Margarita Rodiónovna\u0027s bass voice rang out in the doorway.—\"Varvára, wheel your father!\" \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch drew a breath of relief and followed Várenka, who lightly pushed in front of her the heavy chair. \n \n Tea was prepared in the English fashion, with a mass of cold viands. A huge rare piece of roast beef was flanked by bottles of wine, and this evoked a laugh of contentment on the part of the colonel. It seemed as though even his half-dead legs, enveloped in bear-skin, quivered with the anticipation of pleasure. He was rolled up to the table, and stretching out his fat, trembling hands, overgrown with dark hair, toward the bottles, he laughed aloud, shaking the air of the great dining-room, set around with chairs plaited from osier twigs. \n \n The tea-drinking lasted a torturingly long time, and throughout it the colonel narrated military anecdotes, in a hoarse voice, Margarita Bodiónovna interposed brief remarks in her bass, and Várenka chatted softly but vivaciously with Elizavéta Sergyéevna. \n \n \"What is she talking about?\"—thought Ippolít Sergyéevitch sadly, delivered over to the colonel as a victim. \n \n It seemed to him that she was paying too little attention to him to-day. Was this coquetry? And he felt that he was on the point of becoming angry with her. But now she cast a glance in his direction, and uttered a ringing laugh. \n \n \"My sister has called her attention to me!\" reflected Ippolít Sergyéevitch, frowning with displeasure. \n \n \"Ippolít Sergyéevitch! Have you finished your tea?\" inquired Várenka. \n \n \"Yes, long ago....\" \n \n [Pg 435] \n \n \"Would you like to take a stroll? I will show you some splendid places!\" \n \n \"Let us go. And will you come too, Liza?\" \n \n \"No! I find it pleasant to sit with Margarita Rodiónovna and the Colonel.\" \n \n \"Ho, ho, ho! Agreeable to stand on the brink of the grave, into which my half-dead body is rolling!\" and the colonel roared with laughter. \"Why do you say that?\" \n \n \"The next thing, she will be asking me—\u0027don\u0027t you find it tiresome at our house?\u0027—\" thought Ippolít Sergyéevitch, as he emerged with Várenka from the house into the garden. But she asked him: \n \n \"How do you like papa?\" \n \n \"Oh!\"—exclaimed Ippolít Sergyéevitch softly. \"He inspires respect!\" \n \n \"Aha!\" replied Várenka, with satisfaction.—\"That\u0027s what everybody says. He\u0027s frightfully brave! You know, he does not talk about himself, but Aunt Lutchítzky was in the same regiment with him, and she said that at Górny Dubnyák a ball crushed his horse\u0027s nostrils, and the animal carried him straight in among the Turks. But the Turks pursued him; he managed to wheel and gallop along their line; of course, they killed the horse; he fell, and saw that four men were running toward him ... One rushed up, and brandished the butt-end of a rifle over him, but papa let fly,—whack! and the man fell at his feet. He discharged a revolver straight in his face—bang! And then he pulled his leg out from under the horse, and the other three rushed up, and more after them, and our own soldiers flew to meet them, with Yákovleff ... you know who he was?... Papa seized the dead man\u0027s rifle, sprang to his feet—and forward! But he was awfully strong, and that came near ruining him; he hit the Turk[Pg 436] over the head, and the gun broke, and he had nothing but his sword left, but it was bad and dull, and a Turk was trying to kill him with a bayonet-thrust in the breast. Then papa grasped the strap of the rifle in his hand, and ran to meet his own men, dragging the Turk after him. He understood that he was lost, turned his face toward the foe, wrenched the gun away from the Turk, and dashed at them—hurrah! Then Yákovleff rushed up with the soldiers, and they set to work so heartily, that the Turks beat a retreat. They gave papa the George[3] for that, but he flew into a rage, because they did not give the George to a non-commissioned officer of his regiment, who had saved Yákovleff twice and papa once in that fight, and refused the cross. But when they gave it to the non-commissioned officer, then he took it.\" \n \n [3] The Order of St. George—the most prized of Russian Orders, because it must be won by desperate, personal valor, on the field of battle. The names of the members are inscribed in gold on the white marble walls of the grand Hall of St. George, in the Great Palace, in the Krémlin, at Moscow. The ribbon is orange and black.—Translator. \n \n \"You tell about that fight exactly as though you had taken part in it....\" remarked Ippolít Sergyéevitch, interrupting her narration. \n \n \"Ye-es....\" she said slowly, sighing and puckering up her eyes.—\"I like war ... And I\u0027m going, as a Sister of Mercy, if they begin to fight....\" \n \n \"Then I shall go as a soldier....\" \n \n \"You?\" she inquired, scanning his figure.—\"Come, you are jesting,... you would make a poor soldier.. you are so weak, so thin....\" \n \n This stung him. \n \n \"I am strong enough, I assure you....\" he declared, as though warning her. \n \n [Pg 437] \n \n \"Well, you don\u0027t say so?\" said Várenka composedly, not believing him. \n \n A raging desire to seize her in his arms, and crush her to his breast with all his might flamed up within him—to crush her so that the tears would gush forth from her eyes. He cast a hasty glance around, twitched his shoulders, and immediately felt ashamed of his impulse. \n \n They walked through the garden along a path set with regular rows of apple-trees, and behind them, at the end of the path, gazed forth the windows of the house. Apples kept falling from the trees, striking the earth dully, and voices resounded somewhere close at hand. One asked: \n \n \"I suppose he has come wooing too?\" \n \n But the other swore gruffly. \n \n \"Wait ...\" Várenka stopped her companion, grasping his sleeve, \"let\u0027s hear what they have to say about us....\" \n \n He cast a harsh glance at her, and said: \n \n \"I am not fond of eavesdropping to the gossip of servants.\" \n \n \"But I love it....\" declared Várenka, \"when they are by themselves, they always talk very interestingly about us, their masters....\" \n \n \"It may be interesting, but it is not nice....\" laughed Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n \"Why not? They always speak well of me.\" \n \n \"I congratulate you....\" \n \n He was the prey of a malicious impulse to speak sharply, rudely to her, to wound her. To-day her conduct agitated him:—yonder, in the house, she had paid no attention to him for a long time, just as though she did not understand that he had come for her sake, and to see her, and[Pg 438] not to see her crippled father, and dried-up aunt. Then, when she pronounced him a weakling, she had begun to look upon him with a certain condescension. \n \n \"What is the meaning of all this?\" he said to himself.—\"If my exterior does not please her, and I am not interesting from the internal point of view—what has attracted her to me? A new face—and nothing more?\" \n \n He believed that she was gravitating toward him, and thought that he had to deal with coquetry under the guise of ingenuousness and artlessness. \n \n \"Perhaps she considers me stupid ... and hopes that I shall grow wiser....\" \n \n \"My aunt is right ... it is going to rain!\" said Várenka, gazing into the distance,—\"see, what a dark cloud ... and it is growing sultry, as it always does before a thunder-storm....\" \n \n \"That is unpleasant..\" said Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \"We must turn back, and warn my sister....\" \n \n \"Why?\" \n \n \"That we may return home before it begins to rain....\" \n \n \"Who is going to let you go? And you would not be able to get there before the thunderstorm begins.... You will have to wait here.\" \n \n \"And what if the rain should last until night?\" \n \n \"You will spend the night with us,\" said Várenka categorically. \n \n \"No, that is inconvenient....\" protested Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n \"Oh Lord! Is it so difficult to spend one night inconveniently?\" \n \n \"I had not my own comfort in view....\" \n \n \"Then don\u0027t worry yourself about other people—each person can take care of himself.\" \n \n [Pg 439] \n \n They disputed and walked on, but the dark cloud swept swiftly to meet them across the sky, and already the thunder was beginning to rumble somewhere far away. An oppressive sultriness permeated the atmosphere, as though the approaching thunder-cloud, condensing all the burning heat of the day, were driving it before it. And the leaves on the trees grew still, in eager expectation of the refreshing moisture. \n \n \"Shall we turn back?\" suggested Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n \"Yes, because it is stifling.... How I detest the time before something is coming ... before a thunderstorm, before holidays. The thunderstorm or the holiday is all well enough in itself, but it is tiresome to wait for it. If everything could only be done at once ... you could lie down and sleep—it is winter, and cold; you wake—and it is spring, with flowers and sun ... or, the sun is shining, and, all at once, there is darkness, thunder, a downpour....\" \n \n \"Perhaps you would like to have a man also change as suddenly and unexpectedly?\" inquired Ippolít Sergyéevitch, with a laugh. \n \n \"A man should always be interesting....\" she said, sententiously. \n \n \"But what do you mean by being interesting?\"—exclaimed Ippolít Sergyéevitch, with vexation. \n \n \"What do I mean? Why ... it is difficult to say I think that all people would be interesting, if they were more ... lively ... yes, more lively! If they laughed, sang, played more ... if they were more daring, stronger ... even audacious ... even coarse..\" \n \n He listened attentively to her definitions, and asked himself: \n \n [Pg 440] \n \n \"Is she recommending to me the programme of the relations which she wishes me to bear toward her?...\" \n \n \"There\u0027s no swiftness in people.. and everything ought to be done swiftly, in order that life should be interesting ....\" she explained, with a serious face. \n \n \"Who knows? Perhaps you are right....\" remarked Ippolít Sergyéevitch softly. \"That is to say, not entirely right....\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t excuse yourself!—\" she laughed.—\"Why not entirely? It\u0027s either entirely right or not right at all ... it\u0027s either good or bad ... either handsome or homely ... that\u0027s the way to argue! But people say: \u0027she\u0027s quite nice, quite pretty ...\u0027 and it\u0027s simply out of cowardice that they speak in that way ... they\u0027re afraid of the truth, for some reason or other!\" \n \n \"Well, you know, that by just this division into two, you insult far too many!\" \n \n \"How so?\" \n \n \"By injustice....\" \n \n \"A man always keeps coming back to that same justice! Just as though all life were contained in it and one couldn\u0027t possibly get along without it. But who wants it?\" She cried out angrily and capriciously, and her eyes kept contracting and emitting sparks. \n \n \"Everyone, Varvára Vasílievna! Everyone, from the peasant ... to yourself....\" said Ippolít Sergyéevitch didactically, as he watched her agitation, and tried to explain it to himself. \n \n \"I don\u0027t want any justice!\"—she rejected it with decision, and even made a gesture with her hand, as though she were repelling something.—\"And if I do need it, I\u0027ll find it for myself ... Why are you forever bothering yourself about people? And ... you simply say that,[Pg 441] in order to make me angry ... because to-day you are consequential, and pompous....\" \n \n \"I? I make you angry? Why?\" said Ippolít Sergyéevitch, in amazement. \n \n \"How should I know? Because you are bored, probably .... But ... you\u0027d better stop it! I\u0027m loaded to the muzzle.. even without your interference! They have been feeding me on sermons the whole week, all because of my suitors ... they have flooded me with every sort of venom ... and vile suspicions ... thanks to you!\" \n \n Her eyes flashed with a phosphorescent gleam, her nostrils quivered, and she trembled all over with the agitation which had suddenly seized upon her. Ippolít Sergyéevitch, with a mist in his eyes, and a rapid beating of the heart, began hotly to defend her against herself. \n \n \"I did not mean to anger you....\" \n \n But, at that moment, the thunder crashed noisily over their heads—as though some monstrously-large and coarsely-good-natured person were laughing. Stunned by the terrific sound, they both shuddered, and halted, for an instant, but immediately set out, at a rapid pace, for the house. The foliage trembled on the trees, and a shadow fell upon the earth from the thunder-cloud, which spread over the sky in a soft, velvety canopy. \n \n \"But what a quarrel you and I have had!\" said Várenka on the way. —\"I did not notice how the cloud was creeping up.\" \n \n On the porch of the house stood Elizavéta Sergyéevna, and Aunt Lutchítzky, with a large straw hat on her head, which made her look like a sunflower. \n \n \"There is going to be a terrific thunderstorm,\" she announced, in her impressive bass voice, straight in[Pg 442] Ippolít Sergyéevitch\u0027s face, as though she considered it her plain duty to assure him of the approach of the tempest. Then she said: \n \n \"The colonel has fallen asleep....\" and vanished. \n \n \"How does this please you?\" asked Elizavéta Sergyéevna, indicating the sky with a nod.—\"I think we shall be obliged to spend the night here.\" \n \n \"If we do not incommode anyone....\" \n \n \"That\u0027s just like a man!\"—exclaimed Várenka staring at him with amazement, and almost with pity.— \n \n \"You\u0027re always afraid of inconveniencing people, of being unjust ... akh, oh Lord! Well, and you must find it tiresome to live ... always on pins and needles! The way I think about it is—if you want to inconvenience people, do it, if you want to be unjust, be unjust!...\" \n \n \"And God Himself will decide who is in the right,\" interposed Elizavéta Sergyéevna, smiling at her with a consciousness of her own superiority.—\"I think I must hide myself under the roof.... What are you going to do?\" \n \n \"We will watch the thunderstorm here,—won\u0027t we?\" the girl asked, addressing Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n He expressed his assent by a bow. \n \n \"Well, I am not fond of the grandiose phenomena of Nature.. if they are likely to produce fever or a cold in the head. Moreover, one can enjoy a thunderstorm through the window-panes ... a?!\" \n \n The lightning flashed; the gloom, rent by it, quivered, for a moment revealing what it had engulfed, and then flowed together again. For a couple of seconds, a crushing silence reigned, then the thunder roared, like the discharge of a battery, and its rumblings rolled over the house. The wind burst forth, and seizing the dust and[Pg 443] rubbish on the ground, and whirled around with everything it had gathered, rising upward in a column. Straws, bits of paper, leaves flew about; the martins clove the air with frightened squeaks, the foliage rustled dully on the trees, on the iron roof of the house the dust could be heard, giving rise to a noisy rattle. \n \n Várenka watched this play of the storm from behind the jamb of the door, and Ippolít Sergyéevitch, winking from the dust, stood behind her. The porch was like a box, which is dark inside, but when the lightning flashed, the girl\u0027s graceful figure was illuminated by a bluish, spectral light. \n \n \"Look ... look!\" cried Várenka, when the lightning rent the thunder-cloud.... \"did you see? The thunder-cloud seems to smile—doesn\u0027t it? It greatly resembles a smile ... there are just such surly and taciturn people—that sort of a man remains silent, keeps silent for ever so long, and then, all of a sudden, he smiles:—his eyes blaze, his teeth gleam.... And here comes the rain!\" \n \n On the roof the big, heavy drops of rain drummed, at long intervals, at first, then closer and closer together, and, at last, with a roaring noise. \n \n \"Let us go away...\" said Ippolít Sergyéevitch \"... you will get wet.\" \n \n He found it awkward to stand so close to her, in that dense darkness—awkward and disagreeable. And he thought, as he looked at her neck: \n \n \"What if I were to kiss it?\" \n \n The lightnings flashed, lighting up half of the heaven, and by their illumination Ippolít Sergyéevitch perceived that Várenka was waving her arms, with cries of rapture, and standing, with her body leaning backward, as though[Pg 444] presenting her breast to the lightning. He seized her from behind, by the waist, and almost laying his head on her shoulder, he asked her, panting: \n \n \"What ... what ... is the matter with you?\" \n \n \"Why, nothing!\" she exclaimed with vexation, freeing herself from his arms with a supple, powerful motion of her body.—\"Good heavens, how frightened you are ... and you a man!\" \n \n \"I was alarmed for you,\" he said, in low tone, retreating into the corner. \n \n The contact with her seemed to burn his hands, and filled his breast with inextinguishable fire of desire to embrace her, to embrace her strongly, even to pain. He had lost his self-control, and he wanted to quit the porch, and stand in the rain, where the big drops were lashing the trees like scourges. \n \n \"I will go into the house,\" said he. \n \n \"Let us go,\" agreed Várenka with displeasure, and slipping noiselessly past him, she went through the door. \n \n \"Ho, ho, ho!\" the colonel greeted them.—\"What? By order of the commander of the elements you are arrested until further notice? Ho, ho, ho!\" \n \n \"This is a frightful thunderstorm,\" remarked Aunt Lutchítzky, with the utmost seriousness, intently scanning the pale face of their guest. \n \n \"I do not like these mad fits of Nature!\" said Elizavéta Sergyéevna, with a scornful grimace on her cold face.—\"Thunder-storms, snow-storms;—why such a useless waste of a mass of energy?\" \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch, suppressing his emotion, hardly found the strength to ask his sister calmly: \n \n \"Will it last long, do you think?\" \n \n \"All night,\" Margarita Rodiónovna answered him. \n \n [Pg 445] \n \n \"I think it will,\" assented his sister. \n \n \"You can\u0027t tear yourselves away from here!\" declared Várenka, with a laugh. \n \n Polkánoff shuddered, feeling that there was something fatal in her laugh. \n \n \"Yes, we shall be obliged to spend the night here,\" said Elizavéta Sergyéevna.... \"We cannot pass through the Kámoff thicket of young trees, by night, without defacing the equipage ... by good luck....\" \n \n \"There are plenty of chambers here,\" announced aunt Lutchítzky. \n \n \"Then ... I will beg you to excuse me! a thunderstorm has the most shocking effect upon me!... I should like to know ... where I am to be quartered ... I will go there, for a few minutes.\" \n \n Ippolít\u0027s words, uttered in a low, broken voice, produced a general alarm. \n \n \"Sal ammoniac!\" boomed Margarita Rodiónovna, in her deep bass, and, springing from her chair, she disappeared. \n \n Várenka bustled about the room with astonishment written on her face, and said to him: \n \n \"I\u0027ll show you directly ... I will assign you a place ... where it is quiet....\" \n \n Elizavéta Sergyéevna was the most composed of them all, and asked him, with a smile: \n \n \"Are you dizzy?\" \n \n And the colonel said, hoarsely: \n \n \"Fiddle-faddle! It will pass off! My comrade, Major Gortáloff, who was killed by the Turks during a sortie, was a dashing fellow! Oh! a rare fellow! A valiant young man! At Sístoff, he walked forward straight on the bayonets, ahead of the soldiers, as calmly as though he[Pg 446] were leading a dance:—he hewed, slashed, shouted, broke his sword, seized a club, and thrashed the Turks with that. He was a brave man, and there aren\u0027t many such! But he, also, got nervous in a thunderstorm, like a woman ... it was ridiculous! He turned pale, and reeled, as you do, and cried \u0027akh,\u0027 and \u0027okh!\u0027 He was a hard drinker, and a jolly dog, twelve vershóks tall[4] ... imagine how it became him!\" \n \n [4] A vershók is 1 3/4 inches.—Translator. \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch looked, and listened, made his excuses, calmed them all, and cursed himself. His head really was swimming, and when Margarita Rodiónovna thrust a smelling-bottle under his nose, and commanded him: \"Smell that!\" ... he seized the salts, and began inhaling the penetrating odor into his nostrils, feeling, that this whole scene was comic, and was lowering him in Várenka\u0027s eyes. \n \n The rain beat angrily against the window, the lightnings flashed in their glare, the peals of thunder made the panes rattle in a frightened way, and all this reminded the colonel of the uproar of battle. \n \n \"During the last Turkish campaign ... I don\u0027t remember where ... there was just such a tumult as this. Thunder, a torrent of rain, lightning, volleys of firing from the artillery, a scattered fire from the infantry.... Lieutenant Vyákhireff took out a bottle of brandy, put the neck in his lips, and—bul-bul-bul! And a bullet smashed the bottle to flinders! The Lieutenant looked at the neck of the bottle in his hand, and said: \u0027Devil take it, they are making war on bottles!\u0027 Ho, ho, ho! But I said to him: \u0027You\u0027re mistaken, Lieutenant, the Turks are firing at bottles, but it is you who are making war on bottles!\u0027 Ho, ho, ho! Witty, wasn\u0027t it?\" \n \n [Pg 447] \n \n \"Do you feel better?\" Aunt Lutchítzky asked Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n He thanked her, with clenched teeth, as he looked at them all with mournfully-angry eyes, and remarked that Várenka was smiling incredulously and with surprise at something which his sister was whispering to her, with her ear bent toward her. At last he succeeded in getting away from these people, and flinging himself on the divan in the little chamber which had been assigned to him, he began to reduce his emotions to order, to the sound of the rain. \n \n Impotent wrath against himself struggled within him with the desire to understand how it had come about, that he had lost the power of self-control,—could the attraction toward that young girl be so deeply seated within him? But he could not manage to settle down upon any one thing, and pursue his thought to the end; a fierce tempest of excited emotions was raging within him. At first he resolved, that he would come to an explanation with her that very day, and immediately rejected this resolve, when he remembered, that behind it stood the obligation which he was reluctant to fulfil, of entering into definite relations to Várenka, and, of course, he could not marry that beautiful monster! He blamed himself for having gone so far in his infatuation for her, and for having lacked boldness in his dealings with her. It seemed to him, that she was entirely ready to give herself to him, and that she was coldly playing with him, playing like a coquette. He called her stupid, an animal, heartless, and answered himself, defending her. And the rain dashed menacingly against the window, and the whole house shook with the peals of thunder. \n \n But there is no fire which does not die out! After a[Pg 448] prolonged and painful struggle, Ippolít Sergyéevitch succeeded in repressing himself within the bounds of reason, and all his agitated emotions, beating a retreat to some spot deep within his heart, gave way to confusion and indignation at himself. \n \n A young girl, irreparably spoiled by her abnormal surroundings, inaccessible to the suggestions of sound sense, immovably steadfast in her errors,—that strange young girl had turned him almost into an animal, in the course of three months! And he felt himself crushed by the disgrace of the fact. He had done all he could to render her human; if he had not been able to do more, that was no fault of his. But after he had done what he could, he ought to have gone away from her, and he was to blame for not having taken his departure at the proper time, and for having allowed her to evoke in him a shameful outburst of sensuality. \n \n \"A less honorable man than myself would have been wiser than I, under the given circumstances, I think.\" One unexpected thought stung him painfully: \n \n \"Is it honor which restrains me? Perhaps, it is only weakness of feeling? What if it is not feeling, but desire which agitates me thus? Am I capable of loving, in general ... can I be a husband and a father.. have I that within me which is required for those obligations? Am I alive?—\" As he meditated in this direction, he was conscious of a coldness within him, and of something timid, which humiliated him. \n \n He was soon summoned to supper. \n \n Várenka greeted him with a searching glance, and the amiable query: \"is your headie better?\" \n \n \"Yes, thank you....\" he replied drily, seating himself at a distance from her, and thinking to himself: \n \n [Pg 449] \n \n \"She does not even know how to speak: \u0027is your headie better?\u0027 indeed!\" \n \n The colonel dozed, nodding his head, and sometimes snoring, all three of the ladies sat in a row on the divan, and chatted about trifles. The noise of the rain on the windows became more gentle, but that faint, persistent sound clearly bore witness to the firm intention of the rain to drench the earth for an interminably long time. The darkness stared in at the windows, the room was close and the odor of kerosene from the three lamps which were burning, mingling with the odor of the colonel, increased the stifling atmosphere, and the nervous state of Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n He looked at Várenka and reflected: \n \n \"She does not come near me ... why? I wonder whether Elizavéta ... has been telling her some nonsense or other ... has been drawing conclusions from her observations of me?\" \n \n In the dining-room, fat Thékla was bustling about. Her big eyes kept peering into the drawing-room at Ippolít Sergyéevitch, who was silently smoking a cigarette. \n \n \"My lady! Supper is ready....\" she announced, with a sigh, slowly presenting her figure in the drawing-room door. \n \n \"Let us go and eat ... Ippolít Sergyéevitch, if you please. Aunty, it is not necessary to disturb papa, let him stay here and doze ... for if he goes there, he will begin to drink again.\" \n \n \"That is sensible....\" remarked Elizavéta Sergyéevna. \n \n But Aunt Lutchítzky said, in a low voice, with a shrug of the shoulders: \n \n \"It\u0027s late in the day now, to think of that ... if he[Pg 450] drinks, he\u0027ll die all the sooner, but, on the other hand, he\u0027ll have some pleasure; if he doesn\u0027t drink, he will live a year longer, but not so pleasantly.\" \n \n \"And that is sensible, also,...\" remarked Elizavéta Sergyéevna. \n \n At table, Ippolít Sergyéevitch sat beside Várenka, and noticed that the girl\u0027s proximity was again arousing an agitation within him. He very much desired to move so dose to her that he could touch her gown. And, as he watched himself, according to his wont, he thought, that in his infatuation for her there was much obstinacy of the flesh, but strength of spirit.... \n \n \"A withered heart!\"—he cried bitterly to himself. And then he noticed, almost with pride, that he was not afraid to speak the truth about himself, and understood how to interpret every fluctuation of his \"ego.\" \n \n Engrossed with himself, he maintained silence. \n \n At first Várenka addressed him frequently, but on receiving, in reply, curt, monosyllabic words, she evidently lost all desire to converse with him. Only after supper, when they were left entirely alone, did she ask him simply: \n \n \"Why are you so depressed? Do you feel bored, or are you displeased with me?\" \n \n He replied, that he did not feel depressed, much less was he displeased with her. \n \n \"Then what is the matter with you?\" she persisted. \n \n \"Nothing in particular, apparently ... but ... sometimes ... an excess of attentions to a man tires him.\" \n \n \"An excess of attentions?\" Várenka anxiously put a counter-question.—\"Whose? Papa\u0027s? For aunty has not been talking with you.\" \n \n He felt that he was blushing under this invulnerable[Pg 451] artlessness, or hopeless stupidity. But she, not waiting for his reply, suggested to him, with a smile: \n \n \"Don\u0027t be like that, will you? Please! I have a dreadful dislike for gloomy people.... Come, what do you think of this—let us play cards.. do you know how?\" \n \n \"I play badly.. and, I must confess, that I am not fond of that form of uselessly wasting time said Ippolít Sergyéevitch, feeling that he was effecting a reconciliation with her. \n \n \"I don\u0027t like it either ... but what is one to do? You see how tiresome it is here!\" said the young girl bitterly.—\"I know that you have become as you are precisely because it is so tedious.\" \n \n He began to assure her of the contrary, and the more he talked, the more ardent did his words become, until, at last, before he knew what he was doing, he wound up: \n \n \"If you like, I should not find it tiresome in a desert with you....\" \n \n \"What am I to do for that?\" she caught him up, and he perceived that her wish to cheer him up was thoroughly sincere. \n \n \"You need do nothing,—\" he replied, concealing deep within him the reply which he would have liked to make. \n \n \"No, really, you came hither to rest, you have so much difficult work, you require strength, and before your arrival, Liza said to me: \u0027You and I will help the learned man to rest and divert himself....\u0027 But we ... what can I do? Really!... if I could get away from this tediousness ... I\u0027d kiss you heartily!\" \n \n Things grew dark before his eyes, and all the blood flew to his heart so stormily that he fairly reeled. \n \n \"Try it ... kiss me ... kiss me....\" he said, in a low voice, as he stood before her, without seeing her. \n \n [Pg 452] \n \n \"Oho! So that\u0027s what you are like!\" laughed Várenka, and vanished. \n \n He hastened after her, and stopped short, clutching at the jamb of the door, and his whole being yearned toward her. \n \n A few seconds later he saw the colonel:—the old man was sleeping, with his head resting on his shoulder, and snoring sweetly. It was this sound which attracted Ippolít Sergyéevitch\u0027s attention. Then he was compelled to convince himself that the monotonous and lugubrious moaning was not resounding in his own breast, but outside the windows, and that it was the rain weeping, and not his suffering heart. Then anger flashed up within him. \n \n \"You are playing with me ... you are playing with me thus?\" ... he reiterated to himself, gritting his teeth, and he threatened her with some humiliating chastisement. His breast was in a glow, but his feet and his head stung him like sharp icicles. \n \n Laughing merrily over something, the ladies entered, and, at the sight of them, Ippolít Sergyéevitch inwardly pulled himself together. Aunt Lutchítzky was laughing in a dull way, as though bubbles were bursting somewhere in her chest. Várenka\u0027s face was animated by a roguish smile, and Elizavéta Sergyéevna\u0027s laughter was condescendingly restrained. \n \n \"Perhaps they are laughing at me!\" thought Ippolít Sergyéevitch. \n \n The game of cards which Várenka had suggested did not take place, and this afforded Ippolít Sergyéevitch the possibility of withdrawing to his room, under the pretext of indisposition. As he left the drawing-room, he felt three pairs of eyes fixed on his back, and knew that they[Pg 453] all expressed astonishment. He was not disconcerted by this, being full of the desire to revenge himself on the naughty little girl, to humiliate her, for having dared to indulge in such pranks, to make her weep, and to gaze at her and laugh aloud at her tears. But his feelings could not remain long at such a pitch of intensity, he was accustomed to subject their fermentation to the power of reason, and he never expressed them until they had cooled down. His vanity was irritated to the point of suffering by the conviction that she was playing with him: but, along with this, there again sprang up the resolve, which had been suppressed by the recent scene, to pay off the girl by utter neglect of her beauty. She must be made to feel of how little consequence she was in his eyes,—it would be good for her, but it must be a lesson, not vengeance, of course. \n \n Such arguments always soothed him, but now there was in his breast something which could not be put aside, which was oppressive, and he simultaneously wished and did not wish to define this singular, almost painful sensation. \n \n \"Damn all nameless sensations!\" he exclaimed to himself. \n \n But some drops of water, which fell from somewhere to the floor, monotonously beat out: \n \n \"Tak ... tak....\" \n \n After sitting there an hour, in this state of conflict with himself in the unsuccessful endeavor to comprehend what remained incomprehensible, and was more powerful than all he did comprehend, he decided to go to bed, and sleep, in order that he might depart on the morrow, free from everything which so had worried and humiliated him. But, as he lay in his bed, he involuntarily pictured to himself[Pg 454] Várenka as he had beheld her on the porch, with her arms uplifted, as though for an embrace, with her bosom quivering with satisfaction at the flashing of the lightning. And again he reflected, that if he had been bolder with her ... and then he stopped himself, and finished the thought thus:—then he would have fastened about his neck a mistress who was indisputably very beautiful, but frightfully inconvenient, burdensome, and stupid, with the character of a wildcat, and with the coarsest sensuality, that was certain!... \n \n But all at once, in the midst of these thoughts, illuminated by a surmise or a foreboding, he trembled all over, leaped swiftly to his feet, and running to the door of his room, he unlocked it. Then, smiling, he again lay down in his bed, and began to stare at the door, thinking to himself, with hope and rapture: \n \n \"That does happen ... that does happen....\" \n \n He had read, somewhere, of its having happened once: she had entered during the night, and had surrendered herself, asking nothing, demanding nothing, simply for the sake of the sensation. Várenka.. assuredly, she had something in common with the heroine of that story,—she was capable of acting thus. In her charming exclamation: \"So that\u0027s what you are like!\"—there had, perhaps, rung for him, a promise, which he had not understood And now, suddenly, she would come, clad in white, all trembling with shame and desire! \n \n He rose from his bed several times, lent an ear to the stillness of the house, to the noise of the rain against the windows, and cooled his fevered body. But everything was quiet, and the longed-for sound of footsteps did not ring through the stillness. \n \n \"How will she enter?\"—he said to himself, and he[Pg 455] pictured her to himself, on the threshold of the door, with a proud resolute face.—Of course, she would give her beauty to him proudly! It was the gift of an empress. But perhaps she would stand before him with drooping head, abashed, modest, with tears in her eyes. Or, she would make her appearance with a laugh, with a quiet laugh, at his torments, which she knew, which she always noted, though she never showed him that she noticed them, in order to trouble him, and to amuse herself. \n \n In this condition, verging on the delirium of madness, depicting sensuous scenes in his imagination, irritating his nerves, Ippolít Sergyéevitch did not notice that the rain had ceased, and that the stars were peering in through his window, from a clear sky. He was awaiting the sound of footsteps, a woman\u0027s footsteps, which should bring him pleasure. But they did not ring out through the slumberous stillness. At times, and only for a brief moment, the hope of embracing the young girl died out in him; then he heard, in the hurried beating of his heart, a reproach to himself, and he recognized the fact that his recent condition was one that was foreign to him, was disgraceful to him, both painful and repulsive. But the inner world of a man is too complicated and varied to permit of any one thing persistently holding all aspirations in equilibrium, and therefore, in the life of every man, there is an abyss, into which he will fall without warning, when the time for it arrives. And the cautious, by the bitter irony of the powers which govern life, fall the most deeply, and injure themselves the most painfully. \n \n He raved until morning dawned, tortured by passion, and when the sun had already risen, footsteps did make themselves heard. He sat up in bed, trembling, with swollen eyes, and waited, and felt that when she did make[Pg 456] her appearance, he would not be able to utter a single word of gratitude to her. But the steps which were approaching his door were slow, heavy.... \n \n And now the door opened softly ... Ippolít Sergyéevitch threw himself back feebly on his pillow, and, closing his eyes, remained motionless. \n \n \"Have I waked you up? I want your boots ... and your trousers ...\" said fat Thékla, in a sleepy voice, as she approached the bed, with the slowness of an ox. Sighing, yawning, and knocking against the furniture, she gathered up his clothing, and went out, leaving behind her an odor of the kitchen. \n \n He lay there for a long time, broken and annihilated, indifferently watching in himself the slow disappearance of the fragments of those images which had racked his nerves all night. \n \n Again the peasant woman entered, with his clothing, well-brushed, laid it down, and went out, panting heavily. He began to dress himself, without stopping to consider why it was necessary to do it so early. Then, without reflecting, he decided to go and take a bath in the river, and this animated him, to a certain degree. Treading softly over the floors, he passed the room in which the colonel\u0027s snore was booming, then the door of another chamber. He paused, for an instant, before it, but after bestowing an attentive glance upon it, he felt sure that it was not the one. And, at last, half asleep, he emerged into the garden, and walked down the narrow path, knowing that it would lead him to the river. \n \n The weather was clear and fresh, the rays of the sun had not yet lost the rosy hues of dawn. The starlings were chattering vivaciously with one another as they pecked at the cherries. On the leaves, drops of dew quivered[Pg 457] like diamonds; falling to the earth, in joyous, sparkling tears, they vanished. The earth was damp, but it had swallowed up all the moisture which had fallen during the night, and nowhere was there mud or a puddle visible:—Everything round about was pure, and fresh and new—as though everything had been born that night, and everything was quiet and motionless, as though it had not yet become used to life on the earth, and, beholding the sun for the first time, in silent astonishment it was admiring its marvellous beauty. \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch gazed about him, and the shroud of mire which had clothed his mind and soul during the night that was past began to release him from its folds, making way for the pure breath of the new-born day, filled with sweet and refreshing perfumes. \n \n Here was the river, still rose-colored and gold in the rays of the sun. The water, slightly turbid from the rain, faintly reflected the verdure of the banks in its waves. Somewhere, close at hand, a fish was splashing, and this splashing, and the songs of the birds were the only sounds which broke the stillness of the morning. Had it not been damp, he might have lain down on the ground, beside the river, under the canopy of verdure, and remained there until his soul had regained its composure from the emotions which he had experienced. \n \n Ippolít Sergyéevitch walked along the shore, fantastically carved into sandy promontories, and tiny bays surrounded with verdure, and a new picture opened out before him almost every half-dozen paces. As he strolled thus noiselessly, on the very edge of the water, he knew that new and ever new scenes awaited him. And he scrutinized in detail the outlines of every bay, and the forms of the trees, which bent over them, as though[Pg 458] desirous of ascertaining with certainty, precisely how the details of this picture differed from those of the one he had just left behind. \n \n And, all at once, he came to a halt, dazzled. \n \n Before him, up to her waist in the water, stood Várenka, with her head bent over, squeezing her wet hair with her hands. Her body was rosy with the cold and the rays of the sun, drops of water glistened on it like silver scales. They trickled slowly from her shoulders and breast, and fell into the water, and before falling, each drop glittered for a long time in the sunlight, as though it did not wish to leave the body which it had washed. And the water was streaming from her hair, passing through the rosy fingers of the young girl with a tender dripping sound which smote sweetly on the ear. \n \n He gazed at her in ecstasy, with reverence, as at something holy—so pure and harmonious was the beauty of this young girl, in the blooming freshness of her youth, and he felt no other desire, save that of gazing upon her. Above her head, on the branch of a hazel-bush, a nightingale was sobbing and singing, but for him, the whole light of the sun, and all sounds were concentrated in that young girl, amid the waves. And the waves softly stroked her body, noiselessly and caressingly passing around it, in their peaceful flow. \n \n But the good is as brief as the beautiful is rare, and what he beheld, he beheld for a few seconds only, for the girl suddenly raised her head, and with an angry cry, she swiftly dropped into the water up to her neck. \n \n [Pg 459] \n \n This movement of hers was reflected in his heart—it seemed to fall, shuddering, into a cold which cramped him. The girl gazed at him with flashing eyes, and a frown of anger intersected her brow, distorting her face with fear, scorn and wrath. He heard her indignant voice: \n \n \"Begone ... go away! What are you doing? Aren\u0027t you ashamed of yourself!...\" \n \n But her words floated to him from somewhere in the distance, dimly, forbidding him nothing. And he bent over the water, stretching out his arms, hardly able to stand on his feet, which were trembling with his efforts to support his unnaturally-curved body, flaming with the torture of passion. The whole of him, every fibre of his being, yearned toward her, and now, at last, he fell upon his knees, which almost touched the water. \n \n She cried out in anger, made a movement to swim away, but halted, saying in a low, agitated voice: \n \n \"Go away ... I will not tell anyone....\" \n \n \"I cannot....\" he tried to answer her, but his trembling lips refused to utter the words, for they had no power to say anything. \n \n \"Have a care ... you! Go away!\"—screamed the girl.—\"You scoundrel! You base man....\" \n \n What were these cries to him? He gazed into her eyes with his own drily burning eyes, and kneeling there, he waited for her, and he would have waited, had he known, that someone was brandishing an axe over his head, to smash his skull. \n \n \"Oh! you ... disgusting dog ... come, I\u0027ll give it to you....\" whispered the young girl, with loathing, and suddenly dashed out of the water toward him. \n \n She grew before his eyes, grew, as she dazzled him with her beauty,—and now she stood complete, to her very toes, before him, very beautiful and wrathful; he saw this, and awaited her with eager perturbation. Now she bent toward him ... he flourished his arms, but embraced the air. \n \n And at that moment, a blow in the face from something damp and heavy blinded him, and he fell backward. \n \n [Pg 460] \n \n He began swiftly to rub his eyes—damp sand was under his fingers, and upon his head, shoulders, and cheeks blows rained down. But the blows did not evoke pain in him, but some other sentiment, and as he shielded his head with his hands, he did so mechanically rather than consciously. He heard angry sobs.... At last, overturned by a powerful blow in the breast, he fell on his back. He was not beaten again. The bushes rustled and grew still.... Incredibly long were the seconds of sullen silence which ensued after that rustling died out. The man still lay there motionless, crushed by his disgrace, and filled with an instinctive longing to hide himself from his shame, he pressed closely to the earth. When he opened his eyes, he perceived the infinitely-deep, blue sky, and it seemed to him that it was swiftly retreating further away from him, higher, higher ... and this made him breathe so heavily that he groaned, and slowly sank away somewhere, where there were no sensations. \n \n ... Thus he lay, until he felt cold; when he opened his eyes he saw Várenka bending over him. Through her fingers tears were dripping upon his face. He heard her voice: \n \n ... \"Well—is this nice?... How will you go to the house in this state?... all dirty, muddy, wet, and torn ... Ekh, you stupid!... Do say that you tumbled into the water from the bank.... Aren\u0027t you ashamed of yourself? For, you know, I might have killed you ... if I had happened to get hold of something else.\" \n \n And she said a great deal more to him, but all this did not, in the least, diminish or augment what he felt. And he made no reply to her words, until she told him that she was going. Then he asked softly: \n \n [Pg 461] \n \n \"You?... I shall not see you ... anymore?\" \n \n And when he asked this he remembered and understood that he ought to say to her: \"Forgive me....\" \n \n But he did not manage to say it, because, with a wave of her hand, she vanished among the trees. \n \n He sat, with his back propped against the trunk of a tree, or something, and stared dully at the turbid water of the river as it flowed past his feet. \n \n And it flowed slowly ... slowly ... slowly on.... \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1891/54572.html","bookId":791,"book":{"id":791,"title":"Orloff and his Wife","description":"简介： Almost every Saturday, just before the All-Night Vigil Service,[1] from two windows in the cellar of merchant Petnnikoff\u0027s old and filthy house, opening on the narrow court-yard encumbered with various utensils, and built up with wooden servants\u0027-qua...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1891","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:31 AM"}}
