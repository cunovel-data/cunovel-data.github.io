All official Warlocks who join our Ouroboros Clan will obtain a title and a set territory.” Robin began to go into the details and explain it to Leylin, since they were now on the same side.\\n\\n Through Robin, Leylin then found out that the hierarchy within the Ouroboros Clan was implemented similarly to that of the feudal nobility.\\n\\n There were five rankings, from the highest to lowest, as a Duke, then a Marquis, Count, Viscount, and then Baron. Rank 1 Warlocks were Barons, rank 2 were Viscounts, rank 3 were Earls. Then came the surprise- if Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlocks reached rank 3, they would immediately gain the title of Marquis! This made Leylin aware that discrimination came everywhere. It was lucky he was in the privileged class, rather than the one discriminated against. Rank 4 Warlocks would then be Dukes.\\n\\n The position and treatment he would get were correlated to the title.\\n\\n There a total of three Dukes in the Ouroboros Clan. They had formed an Elders Association, and were called the great elder, second and third elder, and they held the most authority in the Ouroboros Clan.\\n\\n There were, even more, differences as well. If Warlocks who had Giant Kemoyin Serpent or Black Horrall Snake bloodlines would have their title evaluation and territory given very quickly. However, if it was a bloodline like Mankestre, things would be slightly more difficult. Take Krubler, for instance. Though he could be given the title of a baron, but until now, all the processes had not gone through. Territories and the like? There was no word about it.\\n\\n But Leylin was different, for he was a pure Giant Kemoyin Serpent bloodline Warlock, as well as the student of the third elder, Duke Gilbert. He had a great background, and he was prioritised. Titles and territories would be presented to him quickly, and also be given the best treatment.\\n\\n Robin did not bring Leylin out right away, but instead went towards the basement. This was as per Duke Gilbert’s instructions, where Robin brought Leylin to see something.\\n\\n “Leylin, have you seen the spells of Morning Star Magi?”\\n\\n While walking, Robin would occasionally speak to Leylin.\\n\\n “The spells of Morning Star Magi? Of course not!” Leylin’s emotions skyrocketed, “You mean we’re going to see that?”\\n\\n There were rumours that Morning Star Magi could shift mountains and fill seas with just a wave of their arms, displaying terrifying power able to destroy the heavens and wreck the earth. At this thought, Leylin’s heart began to burn.\\n\\n “I thought so. Mentor Gilbert believed that only after seeing Morning Star Magi attack would you be able to understand your path better.” There was a hint of a smile on Robin’s face.\\n\\n “I just hope it won’t scare you!”\\n\\n “How’s that possible?” Leylin laughed involuntarily. If this was in the past, that might have happened, but he had gained part of the bloodline memories from the Morning Star Scorpion Man. He had even witnessed an ancient legendary war, so there was nothing that could scare him.\\n\\n “Hopefully!” There was a slight smile on Robin’s lips. Like Leylin, he did not leave the villa and entered the underground area.\\n\\n *Clang!* After opening a metal door, a large complicated maze appeared before Leylin’s eyes.\\n\\n “This is the Disorientating Maze, a spell pattern that us central continent Magi prefer to use. It is primarily used as sentry and defensive force.”\\n\\n Robin explained to Leylin, “As a student of our mentor, we have the power to enter the first and second level. As for the deeper levels, our mentor has yet to open it up to us.”\\n\\n Immediately after, he stood in front of Leylin and smiled at the entrance to the maze, “Open!”\\n\\n *Ka-cha! Ka-cha!* A layer of rock fell, and a single giant pupil appeared on the wall of the maze.\\n\\n “Remember, this is another student of my mentor’s — Leylin. He will have the same authority as I do.”\\n\\n “Master has already told me.”\\n\\n A spiritual force imprint extended from the giant eye. Leylin could tell that it was the core of the maze, similar to the spirit genie.\\n\\n The giant eye stared straight at Leylin. In that moment, a slight force field covered Leylin, and he tensed.\\n\\n Fortunately, this force field was not on the offensive and merely surrounded Leylin. After extracting part of his aura, he left.\\n\\n *Crash!* The maze dissipated, revealing a pathway. There were different small doors at two sides, with markings on them.\\n\\n “This is Mentor’s laboratory and storeroom. Everything in the villa is a guise. Follow me.” Robin headed into the path, while Leylin followed closely behind.\\n\\n “Here!”\\n\\n Robin guided Leylin for about five minutes, and then opened a door before entering.\\n\\n The moment he entered, he saw an engraving on a door that said ‘Image Resource Room’.\\n\\n In this storeroom, it was exceptionally dim. Crystals flickering with different colours were giving out magnificent rays of their own.\\n\\n “Crystal Number 1! It’s this one!” Robin picked up a red crystal on a wooden shelf the size of a fist, and placed it on a pedestal with a depression on it, at the centre of the room.\\n\\n “This is a projection crystal. We use it to store important footage, such as some important experiments, or battles between high ranking power.”\\n\\n *Buzz Buzz!* After the spell formation was activated, the light in the room dimmed, almost becoming pitch-black.\\n\\n The red crystal on the pedestal suddenly brightened.\\n\\n A dazzling light shone down!\\n\\n Leylin found himself standing atop a little hill. Green plains extended as far as the eye could see.\\n\\n He grabbed at a black beetle that was flying past him, and it went through his palm, appearing on the other side.\\n\\n “3D holograms? It’s very similar to the simulations of the A.I. Chip!” Leylin sighed in awe. At the peak of science and magic, there were definitely similarities between them after all.\\n\\n “This is a classic battle that happened in the central continent’s history. This is the attacker.” Robin appeared beside Leylin, pointing to the east.\\n\\n The scene was pulled closer, and a human city appeared. At the side, many corps were lined up, creating an imposing aura.\\n\\n What shocked Leylin the most were the members. All of them were official Magi! There was not one regular human or knight.\\n\\n “This is an imitation of the ancient Magus corps, ‘Thorned Hammer’. The members were all official Magi, and the team leaders were rank 2 Magi. The captain and vice-captain were rank 3 Crystal Phase Magi, and the corps could even cooperate to display a large-scale fire elemental spell! The range was vast, and on average, its strength was above 470 degrees!”\\n\\n Robin explained to Leylin.\\n\\n Now, two Magi flew out from the Thorned Hammer corps. The auras on their bodies far exceeded those on Leylin and Robin. They were emanating the tremendous bloodthirst of veterans of war. This aura could even be seen on regular members of the corps.\\n\\n Lelin knew that this valour and confidence in victory was built upon multiple conquests. Every time this corps levelled an enemy nest, stepping on the bones of their enemies, they would gain more confidence, even taking in the resentment of the defeated and increasing the strength of their spells.\\n\\n This was the way of war of ancient corps.\\n\\n The two Magi of the Thorned Hammer corps flew out and roared at the city, obviously to urge the city to surrender.\\n\\n Above the city wall, it was empty but for one lonely figure.\\n\\n “This is the other party in this battle—Morning Star Magus, Flame Manipulator, Lord Kason!” There was a trace of reverence in Robin’s voice.\\n\\n Leylin looked this Morning Star Magus over. The Magus called Kason looked like a middle-aged man, wearing luxurious gold robes with embedded with them metal at the sides. There was a fiery-red jade band on his forehead.\\n\\n Facing this entire corps of ancient Magi, there was no sign of fear in Kason’s expression. Instead, he began to berate his opponent, probably telling them to withdraw lest they suffer the consequences.\\n\\n After the negotiations fell through, the entire Thorned Hammer corps roared, powerful and complicated spell undulations connecting all of them and converging on the two rank 3 Crystal Phase Magi in mid-air. Even through the video, the frightening waves were enough for Leylin’s expression to change.\\n\\n In the face of this ancient corps, all he could do was flee, and he might not even be able to escape successfully.\\n\\n At this moment, Flame Manipulator Kason finally moved. Rings of spell rays brightened on his body.\\n\\n ……\\n\\n First was a red spell, the energy undulations indicating rank 1. Following it was a rank 2 spell...\\n\\n A total of four rings of light brightened on his body, and at the last spell, it emanated tremendous waves that even surpassed a rank 3 spell.\\n\\n “A rank 4 spell?” Leylin glanced towards Robin, who was beside him.\\n\\n “Wait a while more. The show’s about to start!” Robin gazed steadily at Kason, envy and anticipation evident on his expression.\\n\\n “Foolish Magi, today, you shall know how the dignity of ancient Morning Star Magi was established!”\\n\\n Kason warned with righteous words.\\n\\n Immediately after, the small energy undulations amplified on his body and seemed to change, to the point that even the rank 3 Crystal Phase Magi grew extremely fearful.\\n\\n “Rank 1 innate spell—Burning Zone!” As soon as this spell was launched from Kason’s body, it covered the entire region.\\n\\n “Rank 2 innate spell—Blazing Attachment!” Little sparks were created in the skies.\\n\\n “Rank 3 innate spell—Lava Region!” Great amounts of flames scorched the surface of the ground, forming a lava-infused land.\\n\\n “Rank 4 innate spell—Meteor Descent!” With Kason’s yell, meteors appeared in the sky, one after the other.\\n\\n “Complement: Ancient Morning Star Magus Final Technique—Fire Rain Annihilation”\\n\\n After the four innate spells were combined, the fusion generated a change that made Leylin’s blood run cold.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-398","bookId":1513,"book":{"id":1513,"title":"Warlock of the Magus World","description":"What happens when a scientist from a futuristic world reincarnates in a World of Magic and Knights?\\n An awesome MC — that’s what happens!\\n A scientist’s goal is to explore the secrets of the universe, and this is exactly what Leylin sets out to do when he is reincarnated.
