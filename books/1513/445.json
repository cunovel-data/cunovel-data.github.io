These Kobolds being here was naturally Tanasha’s handiwork.\\n\\n After receiving Leylin’s order, not only had she collected a large amount of high-grade Kobold blood, she had even captured a group of captives and sent them to Leylin.\\n\\n In the midst of working on Quicksand’s bloodline experiments, Leylin gladly accepted these gifts with pleasure and used them in his research.\\n\\n Right now, the results were rather positive.\\n\\n Leylin looked at the rest who were bound in the center. Their general was well-built at over two metres of solid muscle covered with a dense layer of scales. The horn on his head was also thick and bulky.\\n\\n “I did not expect the rumors about the Kobolds possessing the giant dragon bloodline to be true after all…” Leylin took out a tube of golden blood from his pouch.\\n\\n The tube of blood carried a powerful aura. Even the cowering Kobolds who were covering their heads in the corner raised their head unanimously and looked at the tube in his hands, their eyes filled with desire.\\n\\n “The quintessential bloodline of the Ancient Red Dragon!” Leylin gasped. As long as he was willing to give up this ancient bloodline, with the high-grade meditation technique of Dragon King’s Mystic Might that he’d obtained in the subterranean world, he could have turned any of the Kobolds into a terrifying first generation Dragon bloodline Warlock in a flash.\\n\\n But before he’d conducted more research on methods of restriction, such a thing would be equivalent to Leylin creating unnecessary trouble for himself, which he didn’t want.\\n\\n Even though his bloodline was already finalized, the experiments of the ancient Quicksand Organisation did inspire him tremendously.\\n\\n For instance, one of the fields he was interested in was the ignition of another bloodline to strengthen himself. He had constantly paid attention to that area of research.\\n\\n Upon confirming that all the hubbub was raised by that one crazed Kobold, Leylin soon left the place and reached the experimental area for spells.\\n\\n After molting, he urgently needed to train his control of his powers.\\n\\n The Magus Tower’s spell experimental area was built with the strongest alloy, and had specialized registers and targets for testing. The strength and durability was high enough to withstand any spell at rank 3 or below.\\n\\n “Beginning with rank 1 innate spell, Kemoyin’s Scales...” Leylin’s entire body was soon covered with exquisite black scales, this time slightly differing from before. Multiple decorative designs extended across them to form a symbol. The outer layer had another bright membrane on top, forming a second layer of defense.\\n\\n This was the advantage of an innate spell. When a Magus attained enough power, their innate spell would improve with them and become stronger, displaying the power and effects of higher-grade spells.\\n\\n The same went for the bloodline inherited spells of Warlocks. The stronger the bloodline, the greater the amplification of the innate spell’s power.\\n\\n “Initiation of test!” The tower genie hovered next to Leylin\\n\\n Ever since he had the tower genie, Leylin had allocated most of the A.I Chip’s tasks to the tower genie instead. The freed-up processing power of the A.I Chip were then accumulated and used by Leylin to be spent on deducing more important tasks.\\n\\n The elemental rays dazzled. Numerous elemental particles appeared and coagulated, ready for attack.\\n\\n It started with the commonly seen earth, fire, and water elemental attacks. After which, there were attacks by special light and darkness elemental particles, followed by various fused spells.\\n\\n Lightning, hail, blades of wind, and balls of fire all burst onto Leylin’s body, their power unceasingly rising.\\n\\n *Buzz buzz!* A black radiance emitted from the Kemoyin scales and formed a layer of defence around Leylin’s body, which had repelled those frightening attacks.\\n\\n The violent energy particles had a sustained attack of ten minutes or so. After which, the tower genie’s voice intonated once again, “Spell resistance test completed. Physical defense test initiated.”\\n\\n The moment the words were spoken, the attacking spells vanished and the ground crackled as it split apart to reveal an entry valve. Adamantine puppets appeared from within, wielding huge steel swords, hatchets, heavy hammers, and other large weapons. They started attacking Leylin.\\n\\n For the next half hour, an unceasing rumbling could be heard.\\n\\n The tower genie flapped its invisible wings as it flew towards Leylin and reported, “Kemoyin’s Scales defense test completed!”\\n\\n A numerical report was then clearly projected forth.\\n\\n [Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlock rank 1 innate spell -- Kemoyin’s Scales (Augmented: Rank 3) Spell Resistance: 160 degrees. Physical Resistance: 175 degrees.]\\n\\n “With this sort of resistance, I’m basically immune to the common rank 2 spells,“ Leylin nodded with extreme pleasure.\\n\\n Next was the testing for the Eye of Petrification and Toxic Bile. After comparison, the degree of power of the Eye of Petrification had reached the apex of rank 2, although there wasn’t any other strengthening of the foundation.\\n\\n On the other hand, Toxic Bile’s terrifying poison attack had quietly crept passed its boundary and reached the rank 3 realm.\\n\\n “This bloodline strengthening has benefitted me so much!” Witnessing his own innate spells getting more powerful, Leylin couldn’t help but sigh in pleasure.\\n\\n For an average Warlock, they depended on their own bloodline to spur on their advancements to the next level, whereas for him, he had advanced too soon in the past and his Giant Kemoyin Serpent bloodline couldn’t keep pace with his strength. This had resulted in a lack of advancements in his rank 1 and 2 spells.\\n\\n And now? He had finally caught up with the other Warlocks who had progressed over many years, enabling his innate spells to match, if not exceed, theirs!\\n\\n After testing several of his own innate spells, Leylin asked in silence, “A.I. Chip, how did the simulation go?”\\n\\n [Rank 3 spell derivation progress currently at 98.9%!]\\n\\n The A.I. Chip’s response was swift and got Leylin smiling, “It’s almost done! At the current rate of progress, it’ll only take a short while to completely derive the spell!”\\n\\n Although rank 3 spell models were very valuable, Leylin had gotten his hands on quite a few. As he recalled his previous battles, he realised the same problem recurring.\\n\\n Although he had many tricks up his sleeve, the majority of his battles had him dependent on a combination of potions, spells and the Meteor Sword to successfully defeat his opponent.\\n\\n It may have seemed straightforward, but in reality, if the other party had surpassed him in any one of those factors, he would’ve found it difficult to succeed.\\n\\n To put it simply, he lacked a sure-fire killing move.\\n\\n Such a strategy could arise from a huge demonic weapon, an earth-shatteringly powerful spell or a deadly potion. However, Leylin realised, he had no such thing on hand.\\n\\n Manufacturing a huge demonic weapon would be way too troublesome. The same went for a deadly potion. There were material costs and they had limitations to them. As such, after much deliberation, he decided to bring forward the A.I. Chip’s derivation of a powerful spell, which was tailored for him.\\n\\n In order to see this matter to completion, Leylin gave his full attention and had stopped himself from many other missions. He even had the tower genie share the burden of the A.I. Chip. He wanted to maximize the use of the the A.I. Chip’s processing power.\\n\\n As such, everything had progressed smoothly.\\n\\n “According to the latest estimates, this new spell will have at least 300 degrees of power. Common Crystal Phase Magi will not dare underestimate me, and it’ll be useful enough below the Morning Star realm…” At this juncture, the light faded from Leylin’s eyes and was replaced by a hint of gloom.\\n\\n In his previous expedition to the Forgotten Land, they had offended the Morning Star Magus, Demon Hunter Cyril. Although Cyril didn’t declare any intentions to seek revenge, there were many rank 3 Magi who wanted to get in his good books, and quite a few of them were at the Hydro and even Crystal Phases.\\n\\n Therefore, under such tremendous pressure, Leylin had withdrawn and holed himself in his territory for a long time, coming out only when necessary.\\n\\n Every once in while, there would be a few ignorant trespassers who would gallantly cross the border. They were almost always discovered immediately and brought to Leylin. Under the amplification of his strength by the Magi Tower, Leylin had powers parallel to that of rank 3 Magi. As a result, he managed to defeat the few trespassing Magi easily, the deaths of those Magi affording him some bit of reputation.\\n\\n Over time, fewer and fewer Magi tried to trespass.\\n\\n Additionally, with the ability to deduce spells, Leylin’s confidence soared. Relying on those trump cards, he could fight on par with Crystal Phase Magi without relying on the tower. He felt that the time was right.\\n\\n Truth be told, it was frustrating for Leylin to be cooped up for close to a hundred years in a single territory.\\n\\n ‘Before this, I’m afraid I would still have to make a trip to the Ouroboros Clan to see if there’s anything profitable for me. Phew, astral stone…’ Leylin plotted in his mind, and could not help but sigh again.\\n\\n Normally, once one had their own Magus Tower and had been promoted to Hydro phase, they would have the ability to conduct early-stage experiments on the astral gates independently. Unfortunately, Leylin had not taken any actions for a long time to come. The only reason behind that was because he lacked the key ingredient, the astral stone.\\n\\n It was the base material for the construction of an astral gate, and at the same time a core battling resource held by Morning Star Magi. They were rarely circulated in public, and required a trade with other rare or valuable items.\\n\\n At the moment, Leylin did not have the connections to carry out such exchanges. In fact, Leylin could not even make up his mind even for the trading of mundane objects.\\n\\n It was not due to the fact that he did not have enough enticing treasures to put forth, but that many of the objects he possessed were better off not being exposed to others. For instance, the essence of the ancient red dragon bloodline and the yield from the Blood Vulture’s Nest.\\n\\n He could have easily exchanged any of these objects for astral stones. However, he could also have attracted unnecessary attention from other Morning Star Magi. Leylin had enough trouble from provoking the Demon Hunter, he certainly did not want any more eyes on him.\\n\\n On the other hand, Kesha had secretly been in touch with Leylin and had informed him on an arrangement for astral stones. He looked forward to it eagerly.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-445","bookId":1513,"book":{"id":1513,"title":"Warlock of the Magus World","description":"What happens when a scientist from a futuristic world reincarnates in a World of Magic and Knights?\\n An awesome MC — that’s what happens!\\n A scientist’s goal is to explore the secrets of the universe, and this is exactly what Leylin sets out to do when he is reincarnated.
