{"id":59125,"no":569,"title":"Chapter 569","content":"The Opening\\n\\n Leylin obviously did not think that everything done in the Magus World was right, but he did not approve of the methods in Lava World because they were too time-consuming.\\n\\n Of course, that might have to do with him being a Magus, since he consciously wanted to protect his own interests.\\n\\n “Greetings to the Atlan Union Leader. I am Saka, the envoy of the Divineflame Empire!”\\n\\n Walking ahead of the diplomatic mission was a flaming giant who was over ten metres tall, looking like a fire demon from myths. Him bowing down to a tiny Emberwing seemed rather laughable, but nobody would actually dare to do so.\\n\\n Scarlet Eye merely stood there like an eternal mountain, a sky which people could only look up to.\\n\\n “Also… Our empire seriously condemns the leader, Scarlet Eye, for killing one of our personnel without reason.” Saka’s next words caused the atmosphere to turn chilly.\\n\\n “Condemn?” Scarlet Eye chuckled lightly. “Anything else?”\\n\\n “The leader has to take responsibility for this matter, apologise and resign! If not, the Holy Solar Festival that is a celebration for the Emberwings will mark the beginning of a war between us!”\\n\\n “What?” There was a clamour amongst the audience, and even Leylin’s pupils shrunk. Never had he imagined that the Divineflame Empire’s purpose in coming here was to declare war!\\n\\n Scarlet Eye’s personality was quite open. Was it possible to get him to apologise and resign?\\n\\n When those words exited the envoy’s mouth, Leylin felt a chill down his spine, as if a vicious ancient beast was staring him down. This was the imposing aura that the strong unwittingly gave off, filled with a sense of danger.\\n\\n “Is that so?” Scarlet Eye narrowed his eyes, and the fire elemental giant opposite him took quite a few steps back. The terrifying energy emitting from his body reached the Morning Star realm.\\n\\n This member of the diplomatic mission was actually a Star rank, and that was not all. A few of the other fire elementals behind him had an abrupt change in their physiques, their bodies emanating powerful energy undulations.\\n\\n “With just a few Star ranks? That’s hardly enough!” Scarlet Eye’s half-closed eyes opened slightly, as if he was stating a fact.\\n\\n However, all the Emberwings knew that their leader was already at the brink of fury.\\n\\n “How could we inconvenience the leader to make a move against them? Uncle Bowens!” Schiker was so frustrated that he had flushed red, suddenly standing up.\\n\\n “The Military Office does not permit anyone humiliating our leader!” Bowens stood up, crimson energy covering his entire body. With a wave of his hand, military officials charged out and surrounded the diplomatic mission.\\n\\n Seeing Bowens taking the initiative, Scarlet Eye’s brows lifted. “Bowens, you should first…”\\n\\n At this moment, he suddenly turned his gaze north-west. *Rumble!* An immense blast sounded from that area.\\n\\n The earth swished along like a metal plank that floated on water, drifting up and down. Giant waves rippled, and a large number of cracks appeared, spewing crimson lava and scorching flames.\\n\\n It was as if there was a large flame demon underground. The cracks that formed were like a spiderweb that extended in the direction of Tylasus City.\\n\\n The moment these cracks closed in, the tremendous mountain that the city stood on would completely sink, and the city itself would not be spared.\\n\\n “Haha… Scarlet Eye, do you feel touched that this emperor came to congratulate you personally?” The earth split open, and a large arm that could cover the sky emerged from within, filled with flames and red lava.\\n\\n Scarlet Eye’s expression was the most stern it had ever been. “Archibald…”\\n\\n Accompanying the large hand was the frightening suppression of power at rank 5, causing the many Emberwings to feel suffocated.\\n\\n ‘A rank 5! Could this be the Divineflame Empire’s emperor?’\\n\\n Leylin took a few steps backwards, making use of the shadows from a few buildings to hide. Amidst the terror caused by rank 5 might, his little actions remained undiscovered.\\n\\n Scarlet Eye’s expression was somewhat dark. He knew that if the other party’s attack was successful, the entirety of Tylasus City would suffer great losses, and many high-ranked officials and nobles would die. Hence, he had no choice but to make a move!\\n\\n A high-pitched cry appeared as a phoenix abruptly appeared in the sky, brilliant flames surrounding its body as its scarlet wings collided with the arm.\\n\\n *Boom!* The earth and sky seemed to disappear in that instant, and everyone fell into a daze. When their eyes could finally see again, they saw the giant fire phoenix that Scarlet Eye had turned into circling a flame giant that seemed able to support the skies. The two battled further into the distance, but the residual energy undulations still inspired fear.\\n\\n “Go!” Bowens’ expression was grim as he cried out. Flames with energy at the Star rank blazed on his body.\\n\\n *Swish!* The military officials seemed to act on a conditioned reflex as they headed straight for the diplomatic mission from the Divineflame Empire, with some soldiers and nobles following behind.\\n\\n Among the Emberwings of the Atlan Union, true nobles trained up to at least the eighth level of Fireplume, the Sky rank. None of them was weak. There were even a few Star rank experts keeping watch, but not revealing their strength.\\n\\n However, the diplomatic mission of the Divineflame Empire was not a pushover either. There were a few fire elementals who had already broken through the Star rank, and in that instant the two sides had reached a deadlock. Flames and lava flew everywhere, destroying the square where pledges of peace and victory were to be made beyond recognition.\\n\\n Leylin hid under a gigantic sculpture of the founder of the country. The people nearby had yet to realise there was a military official breaking away from the formation and escaping.\\n\\n At this moment, the sound of Gilbert’s questioning voice sounded in his ear, “What should we do?”\\n\\n Leylin transmitted back calmly, “Watch the changes in the situation, but don’t make a move. Only the fire elementals of the Divineflame Empire have appeared, but there isn’t news of the Mobius Organisation which Jupiter’s Lightning controls.”\\n\\n He had a feeling that this situation probably had more to it than met the eye. Scarlet Eye was not someone so shallow, and wouldn’t have made no preparations. Hence, there could very well be a dramatic change in this situation later on.\\n\\n In this spectacle, three Morning Star Warlocks like them were not considered top strengths, and definitely needed to conceal themselves and wait for a chance to go in for the kill.\\n\\n ‘Besides…’ Leylin looked at the screen that showed the A.I. Chip’s status.\\n\\n The bar that signified the progress of fusing Fireplume’s concepts with his point mass had reached 99.9%. Only a tiny bit was left.\\n\\n A large amount of energy from Fireplume condensed within his body, but this time it was being contaminated by great amounts of darkness elemental energy particles. The energy turned darker than its original scarlet red, now tending towards black.\\n\\n His point mass, as well as the nebula surrounding it had appeared as well, beginning to take in large amounts of the dark red energy from the modified Fireplume, constantly condensing and assimilating it.\\n\\n With the point mass’ purification, the energy of Emberwing had become richer. At the same time, its colour grew increasingly darker, giving it a sinister feeling.\\n\\n “Ley, what are you doing?” All of a sudden, a stern yell and a piercing gaze swept towards Leylin’s location.\\n\\n Bowens’ gaze now could practically kill Leylin, “What are you doing? Trying to desert the army?”\\n\\n ‘Damn it, why did he set his sights on me?’ Leylin walked out, speechless. Seeing the quick changes in Schiker’s eyes, he knew he could not explain this half-heartedly, or he would be attacked.\\n\\n “Bowens is getting increasingly annoying!” Leylin took in a deep breath, Fireplume at the peak of the ninth level exploding from his body, like a dazzling meteor streaking through the skies.\\n\\n “Our people have already acted according to plan. All that’s left depends on you!”\\n\\n A distance away from the square, in a residential building. The original owner had long since disappeared. The walls were filled with red runes, revealing a maroon luster. Some of the blood had yet to dry, and droplets of it were still dripping down, causing long blood-red lines to form on them.\\n\\n Within this building, a few people dressed in black robes were watching the scene in the square from afar through the window.\\n\\n The fire elemental delegation acted immediately and began to fight many military officials and nobles. Such an act caused chaos among the spectating commoners.\\n\\n The attacks from the fire elementals were ruthless. If lava brushed across a commoner’s body, it would reduce them to ashes in an instant. On top of that, the military officials and the nobles of the union didn’t really bother themselves with protecting them. As a result, a huge number of the people watching died, resulting in great casualties. The mix of piercing screams and feeble cries for help were filled with the taste of horror.\\n\\n Many commoners of the union were wailing, pushing everyone else as they tried to leave the blazing hell that was the square. This resulted in the chaos intensifying, leading to more innocent deaths.\\n\\n “Hehe… Resent us! Cry out! These souls filled with hatred and fresh blood are the best nourishment for our spell formation…” An aged voice sounded from within the mantle of a black robe.\\n\\n “Don’t worry, my friend. Us of the Mobius Organisation always trade fairly!” The old man’s voice was as piercing as an owl’s screech, and would cause goosebumps on anyone who listened to him. Yet, the fire elemental opposite him did not seem to mind.\\n\\n “The chaos we’re creating can only last for a while longer. You’ll need to make a move quickly!”\\n\\n “Alright, alright!” the old man cackled, touching a dark green metal bracelet, “How’s the set-up on your end?”\\n\\n White noise sounded from the bracelet, followed by the voice of a middle-aged man, “Enough flesh and blood have been gathered. It’s just difficult to obtain vengeful spirits full of resentment. Only 80% of the charging process has been completed.”\\n\\n “That’s enough!” The old man laughed coldly. “On my command, begin!”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-569","bookId":1513,"book":{"id":1513,"title":"Warlock of the Magus World","description":"What happens when a scientist from a futuristic world reincarnates in a World of Magic and Knights?\\n An awesome MC — that’s what happens!\\n A scientist’s goal is to explore the secrets of the universe, and this is exactly what Leylin sets out to do when he is reincarnated.
