{"id":59044,"no":488,"title":"Chapter 488","content":"Confrontation with Morning Star \\n\\n ‘This voice... a Morning Star Magus?’ Leylin’s pupils narrowed. If someone were to be named as the Crystal Phase Magus with the greatest knowledge of the Morning Star realm in the central continent, it would be himself. Through the A.I. Chip’s simulations and deductions, as well as previously collected information, he already had a deep understanding of the Morning Star realm.\\n\\n The owner of this voice could not be disguised, the words emanated power and a slight aura of rules... This was not imitable by Magi below the Morning Star rank.\\n\\n “Grandfather! Save me!” Leo suddenly smiled, and slowed down ahead of Leylin.\\n\\n In the presence of a Morning Star Magus, Leylin absolutely could not harm him. He completely trusted his grandfather, as well as the strength of the Morning Star realm.\\n\\n “Hmm?!” However, Leylin noticed something different. ‘Although the nature of the aura has not changed, its power is only at the Crystal Phase at its peak… Could it be a puppet… or some sort of clone?’\\n\\n This was, after all, within the boundaries of the Ouroboros Clan. If Morning Star Magi from other clans stepped in, it would be seen as a provocation, leading to war.\\n\\n But the restrictions on this kind of clone seemed unclear.\\n\\n After all, it was very difficult for Morning Star Magi to create a clone of equal strength. Very few succeeded because most of them were limited to the strength of rank 3 Morning Star..\\n\\n With Leylin’s sharp eyesight, he could already see a streak of blue rushing there from afar.\\n\\n “Haha… You’re done for!” Leo laughed carefreely. But shortly after, his smile faded as his surroundings swiftly shrunk and grew again. A scene swept across like a parabolic curve and he ended up looking at a patch of yellow ground.\\n\\n “My head, my head was chopped off...” he said with the last of his consciousness.\\n\\n Leo then fell into eternal darkness.\\n\\n Space shook as a blue shadow suddenly emerged before Leylin’s eyes, looking at Leo’s headless corpse with an angered expression.\\n\\n “I told you to stop just now!” His voice was deep. It seemed to carry an irresistible compulsion to obey every word of his.\\n\\n This majestic aura could only be developed after obtaining absolute power and being in a high position for a long period of time.\\n\\n Leylin was also analysing this Morning Star Magus. Although he had not seen the Azure Mountain King before, he had read up on him. The other party looked exactly as in the portraits— a head of blue hair with eyes that twinkled like stars.\\n\\n Yet, those eyes were now blazing in anger. This was the rage of a Morning Star Magus! It was enough to burn Leylin to ashes.\\n\\n Yet, Leylin simply shrugged his shoulders, “Sorry! I killed him!”\\n\\n If this was his main body, Leylin would have no chance to flee. However, it was only a clone, and there was still hope for escape.\\n\\n “Do you know who he is?” The Azure Mountain King’s eyelids drooped. Someone familiar with him would know that this was a sign of irrepressible rage.\\n\\n “The chief of the Oakheart Clan…” Leylin shook his head and stared at the Azure Mountain King, “I don’t care who he is. Someone who has bad intentions towards me can only repent with death!”\\n\\n “Then let me tell you something too. The last Magus who dared to offend the Oakheart Clan still has his ashes buried below the steps of Azure Mountain City!” The sparkle in the Azure Mountain King’s eyes had reached a limit.\\n\\n A circular mirror appeared in front of him, reflecting Leylin’s figure.\\n\\n “Strip!” The Azure Mountain King gently pointed to the Leylin in the mirror.\\n\\n A hum sounded and, as if he had been rejected by the world itself, Leylin immediately felt the elemental particles that were in complete harmony with him previously leave him one after another, as if stripping him down to an ordinary person.\\n\\n The domain of a Morning Star Magus displayed its terrifying power once again!\\n\\n “That’s not it!” Leylin was a Magus who had previously experienced a true Morning Star domain when he’d been caught by Demon hunter Cyril. He naturally noticed the difference between this domain and that of a Morning Star Magus.\\n\\n The situation this time was much better. His connection with the elemental particles was still barely holding on. As long as he used more spiritual force than usual, he would still be able to communicate with them and invoke his spells.\\n\\n This was just equivalent to his spiritual force being suppressed to a fifth of its normal amount.\\n\\n A bitter smirk appeared at the corner of Leylin’s lips. Even if the other party was only a clone whose total amount of spiritual force and magic power was around the same as his own, he was no match for him in the understanding of spells and laws. Even this simple suppression had immediately put him in a dilemma.\\n\\n With over half his body’s strength being suppressed, how was he to fight a peak rank 3 Magus? Leylin shook his head, feeling that he had been too optimistic previously.\\n\\n ‘However, this is also an opportunity! An opportunity to confront a Morning Star Magus head on, and to gather data!’ Leylin’s eyes sparkled. If he wanted to advance to the Morning Star realm, he could not be lacking in knowledge of it. Although the A.I. Chip had previously used the data he had to simulate some experiments, the lack of samples meant that its progress was still less than 20%.\\n\\n And now, a Morning Star Magus’ clone had appeared in front of him! He had no need to defeat it; he needed only to stall for time as the A.I. Chip gathered data that would be greatly beneficial to him.\\n\\n ‘The A.I. Chip should be able to collect enough data from this fight.‘ Leylin’s eyes blazed brighter. He pulled out the Meteor Sword, a metallic hiss ringing from the blade.\\n\\n At the same time, a layer of dark Kemoyin Scales covered Leylin’s body. The phantom of a huge Multi-Armed Race member appeared behind him as well.\\n\\n ‘Since my elemental particle connection has been suppressed, I can only rely on my physical strength!’ With Multilimb Strength in full effect, Leylin’s entire body enlarged and numerous muscles swelled up as a dark green membrane emerged on the surface of his body.\\n\\n Following a deep shout, Leylin’s Meteor Sword emitted numerous rays of light that shot towards the Azure Mountain King like a rain of arrows.\\n\\n “You actually dare to resist?” The Azure Mountain King frowned.\\n\\n How many years had it been since such a low-ranked Magus provoked him? 200 years, 300? He had never encountered this situation since he’d advanced.\\n\\n After a momentary daze, the Azure Mountain King was overcome by boundless anger. The sound of metal striking metal rang out as a translucent spherical film appeared around his body. Despite seeming like a mere bubbly layer, it actually blocked all of the black rays.\\n\\n “Die!” Leylin’s figure emerged just as the rays disappeared. He suddenly jumped up, and the Meteor Sword slashed across the void, bringing with it a ferocious wind that was aimed at the Azure Mountain King.\\n\\n Black gases shot out of both sides of the blade, so corrosive that it seemed like even the surrounding void would melt. The ground was continuously eroded.\\n\\n *Bang!* The blade, which contained a terrifying poison, was blocked by an aged palm. Although this palm seemed extremely old, with green veins popping out of the skin, it was unmoving like a hill. Even the skin hadn’t been pierced through.\\n\\n The Azure Mountain King raised his right hand with a mocking smile, watching Leylin’s expression change.\\n\\n “Abandoning elemental spells and switching to physical strength, this method is not bad when under elemental suppression. Unfortunately, your tricks are too low-levelled…”\\n\\n “Impossible, your body can’t be this strong!” Leylin blurted out.\\n\\n The Azure Mountain King chuckled, “Do you know what point mass is? And the meaning of the Morning Star realm? The power of the point mass, soul force, is the only power a Morning Star Magus has! However, it greatly surpasses spiritual force and physical strength, having achieved a terrifying qualitative change!”\\n\\n A layer of crystal-clear light emerged above the Azure Mountain King’s palm. With his right hand grabbing the Meteor Sword, he mercilessly punched the blade with his left.\\n\\n The Meteor Sword howled out a sad cry as the blade cracked. The mere physical attack of a Morning Star Magus could actually damage the Meteor Sword, which was comparable to magic equipment!\\n\\n “Although I don’t specialise in physical attacks, as long as I have the amplification of soul force, my vitality will be able to break through the boundaries and ultimately allow me to attain the perfect body of Morning Star!\\n\\n “This strength of yours, and your spiritual force, will only collapse in front of soul force!”\\n\\n As if confirming the Azure Mountain King’s words, a large number of crystal-clear light blades appeared before Leylin, drowning him within.\\n\\n The power of the point mass, also known as soul force, was the next evolution of spiritual force. Only Morning Star Magi could possess such a thing, and it was the first time it had shown its terror in front of Leylin.\\n\\n As he watch Leylin being drowned by the light blades, the Azure Mountain King smiled.\\n\\n The light blades, which were composed of soul force, were not only powerful in physical attacks. They could even attack the spiritual sea within a Magus’ sea of consciousness!\\n\\n Magi who were below the Morning Star realm, without a soul force defence of equivalent power, did not have the slightest chance of resisting these blades.\\n\\n This was the reason Morning Star Magi had almost no enemies at rank 3. Soul force was just too terrifying!\\n\\n Yet, the smile on the Azure Mountain King’s face only lasted a moment, and his expression immediately hardened.\\n\\n With his soul force, he sensed that Leylin might have sustained injuries all over his body, but he had survived the slashes from the soul light blades.\\n\\n Soon after, the Azure Mountain King felt the weight on his hand fade as the Meteor Sword landed in them.\\n\\n *Bang!* A dark green shadow rushed out of the sea of blades, its scaly body covered by a raging dark green film.\\n\\n “Multilimb Smash!” Leylin had thrown away the Meteor Sword, and as the physical strength of his hands surged, he threw his fist at the Azure Mountain King’s defence. The mere power of this punch could shake space itself.\\n\\n The soul force of a Morning Star Magus surpassed spiritual force in terms of quality. Due to this enormous disparity in strength, most of the methods of Magi were rendered ineffective.\\n\\n But Leylin was not limited to the methods of Magi. He possessed a secret technique from another world— Multilimb Strength!\\n\\n A large phantom of a Multi-Armed Race member appeared behind Leylin’s body, growling into the sky.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-488","bookId":1513,"book":{"id":1513,"title":"Warlock of the Magus World","description":"What happens when a scientist from a futuristic world reincarnates in a World of Magic and Knights?\\n An awesome MC — that’s what happens!\\n A scientist’s goal is to explore the secrets of the universe, and this is exactly what Leylin sets out to do when he is reincarnated.
