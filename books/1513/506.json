{"id":59062,"no":506,"title":"Chapter 506","content":"Fall of the Morning Star\\n\\n *Hiss!*\\n\\n In the void that seemed to resemble the universe, a gigantic black serpent emerged. With a body more than ten thousand meters long, it looked like it could swat an entire star out of the way with a sweep of its tail.\\n\\n It was a predator at the top of the food chain which only existed during the ancient times, and was only heard of in rumors and myths. The Giant Kemoyin Serpent had actually descended!\\n\\n The huge black serpent occupying the void had large amber pupils that resembled stars, and the fine black scales on its body twinkled, reflecting its glossy texture.\\n\\n This wasn’t a phantom that was combined with his bloodline aura using spells; this was an actual living being, made of flesh and blood!\\n\\n The Morning Star Arcane Art of Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlocks was indeed this Kemoyin Serpent Transformation! It allowed the Warlock himself to temporarily revert to his ancestral form, and turn into a terrifying ancient creature!\\n\\n The ancient Morning Star realm creature was still completely under the Warlock’s control, and he even retained his original spell-casting abilities.\\n\\n With the terrifying strength of the corporeal body and great magical prowess, Kemoyin Warlocks at the Morning Star realm were definitely a nightmare for many Morning Star Magi!\\n\\n Cyril broke out in a cold sweat when he realised that the large pupils were staring right at him, and the fear hidden in his deepest corners of his psyche suddenly burst out.\\n\\n “No! NO! I still have a Morning Star Arcane Art! I’ll give it my all!” At this moment, Cyril had also completed his own Morning Star Arcane Art. Splendid rays of light exploded forth from his body.\\n\\n “Rank 1 innate spell— Chaos Forcefield!”\\n\\n “Rank 2 innate spell— Meteor Force!”\\n\\n “Rank 3 innate spell— Celestial Explosion!”\\n\\n “Rank 4 innate spell— Rites of Turbulence!”\\n\\n “Combining to form the Morning Star Arcane Art— Aerial Meteor!\\n\\n *Bang!* The void exploded, and an enormous meteorite that seemed like a star emerged, transforming into a streak that charged towards Leylin and fire flickered continuously in the space the meteorite travelled through.\\n\\n The Giant Kemoyin Serpent hissed, greeting the huge meteor in a great clash, just like in the legends.\\n\\n ……\\n\\n Above Phosphorescence Swamp in the Magus World, numerous Morning Star conscients were at a loss for words.\\n\\n “How… How could it be… Why is that youngster’s Kemoyin Serpent Transformation so strong?”\\n\\n After a long silence, the strongest central thought spoke up, “The strength of a Warlock’s innate spell is not only decided based on their rank, but also on the bloodline. The purer the bloodline, the more powerful the Warlock!”\\n\\n “What you’re saying is that the purity of that fellow’s bloodline is even higher than that of Gilbert and the other two?”\\n\\n “Yes, it’s such a regret that we didn’t discover him earlier and kill him… Now that we have allowed him to grow…” The central conscient sighed, feeling that it was a great pity.\\n\\n “Seems like Cyril is bound to lose…” Soon after, the numerous voices started making gurgling sounds like strangled ducks. Even the Morning Star Magi watching the battle were alarmed.\\n\\n “You must be joking!” “How is this possible?”\\n\\n They seemed to have seen something unfathomable happening before their eyes, and sank into collective despair.\\n\\n *Buzz!* Above the battlefield, the void contorted. Leylin changed into his black Magus robe and proudly straightened himself.\\n\\n Upon seeing him, the numerous Bloodline Warlocks below finally heaved a sigh of relief, yelling forth, “Leylin! Leylin!”\\n\\n However, the shouting from the crowd suddenly stopped.\\n\\n This was because Leylin had lifted up a head, one that didn\u0027t even have the chance to die a peaceful death with its eyes closed. It had thin lips and silver eyes— just that they had lost their luster. This was the head of the Demon Hunter, Cyril!\\n\\n “Demon Hunter Cyril has already fallen in battle. Which one of you would like to be next?” Leylin stood proudly on the battlefield with Cyril’s head held high, and looked around.\\n\\n This rank 4 Magus had always been held in high regard for a long time, and was even seen as a Morning Star Magus. But now, he had actually fallen right in front of their eyes?\\n\\n It wasn’t just the Magi in the allied armies, but even the Warlocks of the Ouroboros Clan who pinched themselves, unable to believe their eyes, and thinking that they were dreaming.\\n\\n The battlefield fell into a deathly stillness for a moment. When the Warlocks regained their senses, they all started screaming wildly.\\n\\n All this while, the burden they had been carrying in their hearts was too heavy. Now that they had the chance, they naturally unloaded everything off their chests, and they even seemed to have gone a little insane.\\n\\n At the same time, Leylin was also communicating with other Morning Star Magi.\\n\\n “You shouldn\u0027t have killed him!” A large conscient sounded.\\n\\n “This is a war, an endless fight to the death!” Leylin refused to concede.\\n\\n “Does this mean that you will fight us to death as well?” The other party was naturally not startled by Leylin’s threat.\\n\\n “Of course… Not! If you still decide to continue to battle, I will abandon the Ouroboros Clan headquarters and flee, then attack your territory!” Leylin answered without a single bit of shame, and instead caused the other party to be caught in a dilemma.\\n\\n The battles between Morning Star Magi usually lasted for long periods of time. If one could not subdue the other and let him escape, no organisation would be able to withstand the consequences if he came back for revenge.\\n\\n Leylin had already proven with his military accomplishments that he wasn’t your average newly-advanced Morning Star Warlock. He had great capabilities, even among those at the Morning Star realm.\\n\\n His enemies, who were Morning Star Magi, would be able to defeat him if they joined forces, but they would have to pay a tremendous price. It would also pose a problem if he ran away after they suffered serious injuries!\\n\\n The risk was not nearly worth the reward. And with the possibility of a hidden danger being present even Morning Star Magi would not attack head-on.\\n\\n The many conscients immediately started quarrelling.\\n\\n “Are we going to let him go just like that? He killed Cyril!”\\n\\n “Doesn’t Cyril still have a doppelganger?”\\n\\n “It is only at rank 3, what use does it have? Furthermore, Cyril has bad blood with many other Morning Star Magi, and they won’t let this chance slip by. He’s as good as dead!”\\n\\n “No! We cannot let him go!” The Azure Mountain King bore the most hatred towards Leylin.\\n\\n “Really?” Leylin’s voice was transmitted to his mind directly.\\n\\n “Dear Azure Mountain King, if the allied armies still decide to start a war in the end, I can guarantee that the stardust bugs will immediately be made known across the whole of the central continent!”\\n\\n The Azure Mountain King’s was startled. He glanced around his surroundings. Seeing that none of the Magi discovered that he was communicating with Leylin, he spoke with less restraint. “Are you threatening me?”\\n\\n “Yes I am!” Leylin answered without a tinge of modesty. “Now that I am already a Morning Star Magus, you can’t erase all traces of me. In comparison to you, how many people will choose to believe me?”\\n\\n He even added another sentence at the end, which ruthlessly pierced through the Azure Mountain King’s heart like a dagger, “Also, I seem to have found some possibly disastrous items among your grandson’s belongings! So many interesting sketches… If they are leaked, I’m afraid…”\\n\\n “Enough!” The Azure Mountain King’s tone went an octave higher, and he had no choice but to accept a compromise, “I promise you!”\\n\\n Even as he said this, his heart was bleeding. He understood that with such an agreement, not only would he be unable to seek revenge in the future, he would also be subjected to Leylin’s threats.\\n\\n However, he had no other way out. After all, his strength was not even as great as Cyril’s. If Leylin could kill even Cyril, using military force against him would just be a joke.\\n\\n ……\\n\\n “Damn it! How could such a thing happen?”\\n\\n On the ground, in the command centre of the allied troops, the Bloodline Warlocks on the entire frontline were counter-attacking. This made the green-haired commander hysterical, especially with Leylin having just attacked and killed a Morning Star Magus.\\n\\n “What do we do? What do we do?” Hesitation flashed across his face, and the green-haired Magus tightly clenched his teeth. “Order the Kyasha Beast to attack with full force, and self-destruct at the end. Even if we cannot reap the fruits of the battle, we have to make sure the other party suffers great losses! We have to at least get rid of that Giant Serpent puppet!”\\n\\n The Kyasha Beast and the Duo Serpent Annihilator of the Ouroboros Clan were both puppets; artificially manufactured products at the Morning Star level. Although they had partial Morning Star strength, they were unable to fully put it to use. They were not very intelligent either, and were rather rigid.\\n\\n But even so, the terrifying damage one could cause upon self-destruction could not be looked down upon. If Leylin didn’t pay attention, forget the Duo Serpent Annihilator, even the entire town of Warlocks would be reduced to ruin.\\n\\n Just like how other Morning Star Magi were apprehensive towards Leylin, but did not take action. It would not be wise for Leylin to harm the green-haired Magus just because of the damage he caused. Because threats would always be always mutual.\\n\\n The green-haired Magus then made a decision. He fished out a necklace from his waist pouch, adorned with emerald. He was about to issue an order.\\n\\n At this moment, he was greeted with a fragrant smell. A figure that he was familiar with appeared behind him, and the smell of perfume lingered around the tip of his nose.\\n\\n “Quit playing around, I’m doing something serious!” The green-haired Magus furrowed his brows, but didn\u0027t push the other party away. He knew this person all too well, thus he took no precaution at all.\\n\\n All of a sudden, his face turned blank. He lowered his head, seemingly in excruciating pain, and saw the tip of a blade sticking out of his chest. Fresh, scarlet blood stained the knife, dripping down.\\n\\n A gentle voice explained next to his ear, “The minister of the Dark Serpent department, Trelisse, sends her regards!”\\n\\n “You… You…” Blood foamed at his mouth continuously. He had not been wary of that female Magus at all, and his innate defence was as weak as paper when faced with that dagger.\\n\\n “This mission was completed successfully all thanks to you! Also, don\u0027t even think about using the life entrustment spell to reincarnate; I already learnt of the location a long time ago… One last thing, your choice was a grave mistake. You really shouldn\u0027t have turned against us…”\\n\\n The lady’s voice seemed like the sweetest venom, entering the male Magus’ body along with the dagger. His vitality trickled away unceasingly, and even his vision was starting to blur.\\n\\n Soon after, a black ray of light flashed and the ring finger on his left hand was burnt to ashes.\\n\\n As a high-ranking Magus, and also the commander of the allied armies, he had methods that he could use as a last resort to ensure his survival, the most important one being the life entrustment spell. This would allow him to transfer his soul to any part of his body; as long as that part still existed, he would be able to reincarnate.\\n\\n But what a pity it was that the other party had already seen through it all.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-506","bookId":1513,"book":{"id":1513,"title":"Warlock of the Magus World","description":"What happens when a scientist from a futuristic world reincarnates in a World of Magic and Knights?\\n An awesome MC — that’s what happens!\\n A scientist’s goal is to explore the secrets of the universe, and this is exactly what Leylin sets out to do when he is reincarnated.
