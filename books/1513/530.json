Kill him!” As if having lost his self-control, the Magus held onto the command stick and roared.\\n\\n *Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!* At least eight Void Assassins appeared instantly, charging straight for Leylin. In front of him, the large flame giant was also snarling as it brandished a large flaming metal whip.\\n\\n The sealing formation, the flames, and the surprise attacks from multiple Void Assassins would be extremely troublesome for normal Morning Stars to deal with.\\n\\n Even Demon Hunter Cyril would probably be seriously injured under such an attack!\\n\\n [Beep! Found spiritual force link. Eliminating three areas with fake signals, determining coordinates!]\\n\\n The A.I. Chip’s robotic voice sounded by Leylin’s ears, causing a smile to rise up on his face. Ever since he realised that there was probably someone behind the scene, Leylin had commanded the A.I. Chip try and identify the location of the core control room.\\n\\n The slip ups and injuries sustained from before were all intentionally done to get his opponent to take the bait.\\n\\n A spell formation was not able to supply adequate data and information, but the other party had obviously not been satisfied. He had dispatched someone to attack, allowing the A.I. Chip to discover his traces immediately!\\n\\n ‘From my guesses and the A.I. Chip’s simulation, the other party probably isn’t that strong, and may not even have access to the core control room of the ruins. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be an attack just of this level!’\\n\\n Leylin watched the sharp blade and flames coming towards him, a strange smile appearing on his face.\\n\\n A splendid layer of crimson-red rays suddenly emerged from his body, turning into four rings that floated up and down.\\n\\n “Rank 1 innate spells: Kemoyin’s Scales, Eyes of Petrification!”\\n\\n “Rank 2 innate spell: Toxic Bile!”\\n\\n “Rank 3 innate spell: Intimidating Gaze!”\\n\\n “Rank 4 innate spell: Bloodline Metamorphosis! Combining to form the Morning Star Arcane Art: Kemoyin Serpent Transformation!”\\n\\n *Rumble!* A humongous serpent that measured tens of thousands of metres long suddenly descended on the region.\\n\\n Spell formations fell apart, the earth cracked, and multiple buildings turned to dust. Even the air was beginning to shake.\\n\\n *Po!* The flame giant from before, as well as the many bindings and fire elemental spell formations, were swept away by the large snake’s body. All the runes were destroyed, and even the the spell formations at the base of the buildings flickered out.\\n\\n In front of the Giant Kemoyin Serpent, the Void Assassins that were the size of a regular human were like ants. Their sharp swords could not even pierce through the scales, and instead, were sent crashing to a random area with a swing of its tail.\\n\\n The Arcane Art of the ancient Morning Star Warlocks— Kemoyin Serpent Transformation. This trump card that would allow Warlocks to transform into a terrifying ancient beast appeared once more!\\n\\n The giant black snake hissed as it aimed its head in a specific direction, its starry amber eyes the very personification of ridicule. Its body was like a black storm as it crushed the area.\\n\\n *Thump! Thump! Thump!* On the way, various little flickers of brilliance could be seen on the giant serpent’s body, which then dimmed.\\n\\n “Wha- What’s going on? Is this a Morning Star Arcane Art? He- he dared-”\\n\\n Having been locked onto by the aura of an ancient, giant beast, the Magus in the core control room went limp and fell to the ground. As he made contact with the other party’s eyes, the fear hidden deep in his genes exploded forth as his body went stiff, unable to move even a finger.\\n\\n The direction in which the giant serpent had looked in was evidently the location of the core control room. Seeing how the other party was crushing everything in its way, it would probably take seconds to reach him.\\n\\n This old man shuddered, now regretting provoking this fiendish person.\\n\\n *Boom!* Like in a magnitude 9 earthquake, all the items in the core control room jumped up and fell loudly onto the ground.\\n\\n Hearing the accompanying hisses, the old man shuddered even more in fright. He knew that the terrifying ancient, vicious beast had now reached the outside of the core control room.\\n\\n “I have the defensive spell formation of the core control room. It… It’ll be fine!”\\n\\n The attack from before had been obstructed, giving the old man some confidence. However, before he could struggle to get up, an even more powerful tremor could be felt.\\n\\n *Rumble!* Bricks fell everywhere and the roof was torn open. Two eyes that were like stars shot out terrifying rays of light.\\n\\n “Ah!” The old man went limp, a fishy smell even travelling from the crotch of his pants.\\n\\n “Little worm, do you think you can hide?” The gigantic serpent suddenly turned small, regaining the size of a regular human. Large amounts of black gas turned into armour that merged onto his perfect body.\\n\\n Leylin charged into the control room and held the old man by the throat, eyes flashing with a dangerous glint, “A mere Crystal Phase Magus dares attack a Morning Star on the sly?”\\n\\n His own aura had weakened slightly, the consumption from before had not been small.\\n\\n Due to the limitations of the peace agreement, Morning Star Magi were not allowed to use Arcane Arts that would affect large areas in the central continent. However, this was the Scarlet Crescent ruins, and technically speaking was not on the central continent. Naturally, that agreement did not extend to this place.\\n\\n But why did the other Morning Star not use it?\\n\\n It was because there were usually extremely powerful spell formations in the ruins. If the range of the Arcane Arts were too large, there would definitely be a chain reaction that would not be beneficial to the Morning Star Magi.\\n\\n The second was because Magi had entered in order to plunder resources. How could they use such a powerful technique and destroy everything? Did they not want the loot?\\n\\n Only people like Leylin, who thought nothing was taboo and had the A.I. Chip to find the specific location of his opponent, dared to bulldoze through after determining there were no traps or counteracting spell formations.\\n\\n This also had to do with the old man having yet to gain complete control. If not, with the activation of any of the true ancient spell formations, Leylin would definitely be unable to break through and might even be trapped to his death by the spell formation.\\n\\n “But since I started it, the situation will immediately change…”\\n\\n Leylin laughed wryly inside. This was the consequence, but thankfully, he’d already prepared himself mentally. Even if he did not gain much here, it was all worth it.\\n\\n ……\\n\\n “Hm? These undulations? Morning Star Arcane Art?!”\\n\\n Vicious energy undulations immediately passed through the range of the ruins. Almost all Morning Star understood in that instant.\\n\\n “Since someone has already made the first move, we need to hurry up!”\\n\\n Cybel glanced at the wall made of large amounts of vines, and immediately looked annoyed, “Get out of the way!”\\n\\n “Of course, my lord!” Paul, who knew what Cybel was planning on doing, immediately retreated far into the distance in case he got injured.\\n\\n Afterwards, frightening energy undulations gathered at Cybel’s body, and a giant, all-annihilating storm even more terrifying than Philip’s swept through the place...\\n\\n “A bunch of youngsters who don’t know how to follow rules!”\\n\\n At the other end, a middle-aged man, golden all over like a god, shook his head helplessly. He put down a document in his hands.\\n\\n “Anyway, someone has already taken control of a portion of the detection spell formation in the ruins. There’s also that feeling of being spied on…”\\n\\n The middle-aged man’s brows furrowed, “I’m afraid that this truly must be the headquarters of the ancient Scarlet Crescent, and must have a high value. If news of how I had come here with a group of Morning Stars and yet was one-upped by someone else spreads, it’ll definitely be a huge joke…”\\n\\n “In that case!” The phantom of a giant gold lion appeared behind the middle-aged Magus.\\n\\n *Boom!* Just the pressure from the aura was enough for the entire building to collapse, the air shattering like iron chains.\\n\\n “This feeling… These undulations… It’s a great Radiant Moon Magus!”\\n\\n Collins, as well as the other Morning Star Magi, began to look grim at the other end.\\n\\n The phantom image of a golden lion in the horizon gave them a very bad feeling.\\n\\n It was not just the Morning Stars of Jupiter’s Lightning. Even the Warlocks of Spirit Circle and Wind Wolf Lair immediately sped up their movements, berserk energy waves emanating from them.\\n\\n When they no longer had reservations, the terrifying destructive ability of Morning Star Magi were showcased completely.\\n\\n “As expected, after I made the first move, it caused a chain reaction among the other Morning Stars. None of them are holding back anymore and charging in this direction…”\\n\\n Leylin looked at the notebook that lay wide open. Many buildings had already been broken through by a few black dots, and there were warning sirens everywhere.\\n\\n *Gurgle… Gurgle…*\\n\\n The old man was almost unconscious.\\n\\n Never did he expect that, in just a short instant, these Morning Stars would suddenly turn into ancient oppressive beasts, the defensive spell formations like a mere joke in front of them.\\n\\n At the thought that he had even thought of relying on the spell formations here to deal with them, cold sweat unceasingly dripped from the old man’s forehead.\\n\\n Leylin had yet to come up with a way to deal with the descendant of Scarlet Crescent. He had a very soft personality, and just by being threatened, he had immediately handed everything over, which included even the jurisdiction to control the Void Assassins. This saved Leylin some time, and also allowed the old man to escape the gruesome fate of having his soul searched.\\n\\n It was not just this. On the other party’s body, Leylin found the inheritance from his ancestor, which was quite a large harvest.\\n\\n From his eyes, Leylin could tell that the old man still seemed to be hiding something. Time was scarce, however, and Leylin could not waste more time to settle it.\\n\\n “What are you afraid of? The setup of an ancient Magus won’t be that simple…”\\n\\n Leylin shot the man a glance and spoke disdainfully. Though his earlier actions might have seemed reckless, the route had already gone through the A.I. Chip’s meticulous probing and calculations, and he had not triggered any fundamental, large formations.\\n\\n After all, for ancient Magi, Morning Star was the bare minimum level. How could there not be specific countering spell formations? Those Magi would probably soon be in trouble.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-530","bookId":1513,"book":{"id":1513,"title":"Warlock of the Magus World","description":"What happens when a scientist from a futuristic world reincarnates in a World of Magic and Knights?\\n An awesome MC — that’s what happens!\\n A scientist’s goal is to explore the secrets of the universe, and this is exactly what Leylin sets out to do when he is reincarnated.
