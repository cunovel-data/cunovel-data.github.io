{"id":59080,"no":524,"title":"Chapter 524","content":"Marine Tribe’s Original Form \n Leylin chose to battle here right away. He was confident in his energy control, and on top of that, he didn’t want to move too far away. It would be too tragic if he failed to be the first one to detect the reappearance of the remains.\n He was also prepared to try out an interesting idea.\n For Marine Giant Siebel, Leylin’s attitude was nothing but a provocation. He shot Leylin a piercing gaze, and soon released the massive power of his domain.\n The power of one’s domain would only be perfected at the Morning Star realm. The effects of amplification and suppression would intensify, and the range of effect would also be extended. Morning Star domains were a far cry from rank 3 forcefields.\n Turbulent, vast and immeasurable!\n White ocean waves and the crystal clear sea surface formed a horrifying scene.\n The depths of the ocean were darkened by the frantic waves, giving one an ominous premonition.\n The enormous tides engulfed Siebel, completely hiding his body. Yet, his voice was transmitted clearly, “This is my domain— Ocean!”\n In a split second, the ocean engulfed the entire area, burying the alpines and the wreckage left by Philip’s spells.\n The boundless blue ocean roared at Leylin in rage.\n ‘A real Morning Star domain, and the rules he controls are those of the water element...’ A glimmer of blue light flickered across Leylin’s eyes as the A.I. Chip recorded all data about the fluctuations and the power of the domain.\n Siebel’s aura rose quickly in this ocean, causing Leylin to be thrilled.\n “So you’re of the marine tribe. No wonder your domain is such, changing the battlefield to be underwater.” Leylin’s voice trembled a little. It managed to traverse the depths of the ocean, but there was no reply.\n The marine tribe was a non-human species. However, they cohabited the Magus world with humans. They occupied the ocean while the humans occupied the land. It wasn’t like there weren’t any wars, but most of the time it was peaceful.\n There were legends and records about a Great Magus Serholm who led all human magicians and fought off the enemies from the ocean.\n There were also Magi amongst the marine tribe, but they were extremely rare, as their chance of advancement was even lower than humans.\n To be able to meet with a Morning Star Magus of the marine tribe thrilled Leylin. He was puzzled as to why Siebel was a part of Jupiter’s Lightning, but soon came to a realisation.\n Despite the fact that Jupiter’s Lightning had the help of a Radiant Moon Magus who was one of the top forces of the central continent, it was difficult for even them to nurture a Morning Star Magus.\n Other than resources and experience, luck was an important factor in becoming a Morning Star Magus.\n Given their high status in the central continent, it was extremely hard for any faction to have ten or more Morning Stars like Jupiter’s Lightning did. It was impossible to rely on training their own, so they would recruit foreign Magi as well.\n The auras of the previous bowman and Marine Giant were pretty much impure. Leylin was rather puzzled back then, but now it looks like they could be from a different tribe or are hybrid Magi!\n The enormous waves surged into the sky, forming two dark blue crystal-like hands that gushed down towards Leylin.\n The sharp increase in the air pressure formed unstable currents and caused the space in the region to be unstable.\n [Beep! Data about the Ocean domain has been fully recorded!] Leylin smiled upon hearing the mechanical voice of the A.I. Chip.\n “Corrosion!” Gently, an ancient Byron runic chant slipped out of his lips.\n *Hiss! Hiss!* A large amount of uneven black pores appeared on the dark blue hand, corroding almost the entire arm within a second as if turning it into a beehive.\n *Crack! Crack!* The gigantic arm lost its support and fell apart in the air, soon turning into a huge stream of water that merged back into the sea.\n “In the name of the Warlock! My power of bloodline!” Leylin chanted out loud as a crimson barrier appeared on his body.\n “Absorption of bloodline!” Blood red lightning flashed across his eyes, piercing through the pitch dark ocean as it revealed everything. Meanwhile, aiming at a specific spot, Leylin stretched out his right hand and made a grasping motion with great force.\n An invisible air current appeared, causing a massive whirlpool in the middle of the ocean.\n “AAAH!” a voice bellowed in agony from the whirlpool.\n “All bloodline creatures will be under my bloodline’s control, show up now!” said Leylin, and the blood red glow on his hand converged in his hand as he lifted his right hand into the air.\n Water gushed up into the sky and rained down like a huge fountain as a gigantic blue figure slowly appeared from the middle of the whirlpool.\n Numerous veins protruded from the blue skin, as if about to burst out at any moment. The wriggling veins looked like earthworms, sending shivers down one’s spine.\n The giant groaned in agony, forced out of the sea while being battered by crimson lightning.\n “Multilimb Strength!” Leylin’s eyes glittered, and the humongous phantom of a Multi-Armed Race member appeared behind him. This phantom was much clearer than the previous ones, every single scale and pore on his body distinguishable.\n Even after reaching the Morning Star realm, this foreign Arcane Art could be of great use.\n Leylin even felt that combining the nourishment of his spirit with the body refinement of Multilimb Strength, he would be able to reach the peak of the Morning Star realm at a much quicker pace, and would end up far more powerful than the rest.\n The phantom punched out in tandem with Leylin.\n Even a single arm of the humongous phantom was as large as Siebel. It felt like seven huge mountains appeared out of thin air and came crashing down at the same time when all seven arms smashed towards him.\n Siebel placed both arms in front of his chest, forming a dense shield of water that was to reduce the shockwaves from the attack. However, it was all in vain. The water shield was destroyed under the force of the phantom’s arms.\n *Bang!* Siebel was shot backwards by the explosive force of the collision.\n At the same time, threads of luminous blue liquid shot out from his pores and gathered to form a thumb-sized ball that landed on Leylin’s palm.\n “The bloodline of a Marine Giant at the Morning Star realm!”\n Leylin nodded with satisfaction and kept the bloodline in a test tube. This was a rare material for bloodline experiments, and could earn him a good sum even for his current realm.\n “You are not an ordinary Morning Star Warlock. Who are you?”\n As Siebel regained consciousness, he stared at Leylin cautiously. With the amazing defensive and recuperative abilities of a Morning Star Magus, this sort of injury was nothing to him. Yet, Leylin was completely relaxed as before, clearly indicating that this wasn’t his full strength.\n Siebel gazed at the black haired Morning Star Warlock in front of him, running through all the top ranked Morning Stars in his mind, but did not manage to match the face to anyone. That is, until he recalled some more recent information, something that detailed Leylin’s background.\n “You are Leylin Farlier! The Morning Star Kemoyin Warlock of the Ouroboros Clan! The one who killed Demon Hunter Cyril!” Siebel was in shock. Demon Hunter Cyril was considered a powerhouse among Morning Star Magi, but he’d been easily slain by Leylin.\n This accomplishment was much more challenging than a win-lose in an ordinary face-off and Siebel was well aware of that.\n ‘For now, the best case scenario is that I keep up my defence and sustain myself. I might even have to request reinforcements!’ He smiled bitterly at his own thought. Just then, a ring of pearls glowed around his waist, and he heard urgent voices shouting around, “It’s the Third East Region, we need immediate reinforcements! We’re under attack by Spirit Circle! ”\n “West Region calling for reinforcements, three layers of defence have been destroyed! Damn it, the Warlocks seem to be fully concentrated in this region! ”\n “No, you bloody liars! Cybel is in our North Region, we should be the ones getting reinforcements! Ahhhh…”\n The transmitted voices had a lot of interference, and there were also loud sounds of explosions in the background that added a violent shudder.g.\n Siebel’s heart hit rock bottom. Knowing that Cybel was here as well, he felt hopeless.\n “So this is your plan?” Siebel looked fixedly at Leylin, but could not get any details off that expressionless face.\n “Even if it is so, I signed an agreement with Jupiter’s Lightning. Don’t think you can get rid of me so easily!” Siebel thought in his heart and roared out a jumbled chant of sacrificial phrases.\n The serenity of the ocean was broken again by the violent movement of water as large amounts of it gathered around Siebel. When the rumbling ended, a monstrous creature that was a thousand metres tall appeared in front of Leylin.\n The monster had the head of a cow, the body of a human and tentacles for feet. It growled like a raging bull.\n “This is your original form?” Leylin fended off the water bullets, looking at the humongous form of the magician and chuckled.\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-524","bookId":1513,"book":{"id":1513,"title":"Warlock of the Magus World","description":"What happens when a scientist from a futuristic world reincarnates in a World of Magic and Knights?\n An awesome MC — that’s what happens!\n A scientist’s goal is to explore the secrets of the universe, and this is exactly what Leylin sets out to do when he is reincarnated.
