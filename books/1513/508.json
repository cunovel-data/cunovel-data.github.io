I recommend the Giant Serpent’s Spirit Potion! There are already very few Crystal Phase Warlocks like you in the Ouroboros Clan…” Leylin sighed.\\n\\n After the great battle, the ten or so Crystal Phase Warlocks had dwindled in number to a pitiful seven or eight. Even Leylin’s senior, Lucian, had been unlucky enough to lose his life at the hands of the plant legion.\\n\\n In a situation like this where there were few trump cards remaining, Leylin knew that even though he was in charge every single Crystal Phase Magus was a precious resource.\\n\\n “Many thanks, my Lord!” Freya bowed, seemingly very solemn.\\n\\n “Oh, right. One more thing. I hope the Blood Serpent Family can help me arrange for my Morning Star Ceremony.” Morning Star Magi had very high statuses in the central continent, especially since it was so difficult to advance. Every instance of it was a joyous matter worthy of celebration with a huge circle of friends, and was even a grand ceremony for the entire continent.\\n\\n Based on conventional practices, each appearance of a Morning Star Magus meant that there had to be something like a ceremony. This was an announcement of power, which was even more important for the Ouroboros Clan, given its current state.\\n\\n The bloodline Warlocks, who were in a state of chaos, were in desperate need of a burst of motivation.\\n\\n “It shall be my family’s honour to do so!” Leaving it to her family meant valuing her. Whatever it was, this was beneficial to the Blood Serpent Family. As the leader, Freya could not reject them, nor did she have any reason to do so.\\n\\n “I am also planning to release another piece of news during the ceremony.” Watching Freya, who was biting her lips with an odd look on her face below him, Leylin smirked.\\n\\n “What is it?”\\n\\n “After the ceremony, I shall organise a huge wedding and marry you into my family!” The words that left Leylin’s mouth were earth-shattering, leaving Freya completely stunned.\\n\\n “Marry into your family?” Freya repeated it like a mantra, her child-like features perplexed. Leylin was a Warlock who had recently joined and basically had no support from any bloodline families.\\n\\n “Yes, the Farlier family. Although there’s only me on the central continent for now, I believe we’ll become the first family of the Ouroboros Clan. We’ll even become the best of all bloodline families!” Leylin touched his nose.\\n\\n Though he was the only Warlock in his family and it seemed pitiful, Leylin didn’t care.\\n\\n After all, how could a family with a Morning Star Magus be common? With his pure bloodline, the chances of his descendants advancing were much higher than for other Warlocks. In no time, it would be capable of becoming the greatest family in the Ouroboros Clan!\\n\\n The central continent was much too large. Though Leylin now held control over the Ouroboros Clan, he needed to develop an organisation that was uniquely his. How could there be anything that could beat a family he created himself? Others would have another layer of bloodline restrictions, and this would count as insurance for himself.\\n\\n In addition, he who had already reached the Morning Star realm no longer had to worry about the leakage of information regarding the purity of his bloodline. He now held enough strength to protect himself.\\n\\n Since he needed a female Warlock to spread his bloodline, Leylin naturally chose Freya. First of all, she was clean and honest, and treated him well. She looked pretty as well. What else was there to hesitate over?\\n\\n “What if I… reject you?” Freya bit her lips, slightly unwilling. Though she liked Leylin, she didn’t want things to go this way.\\n\\n “You can’t reject anyway. I rule the Ouroboros Clan!” Leylin’s tone could not be questioned. The rims of Freya’s eyes reddened, and she lightly grasped Leylin’s hands.\\n\\n “I know you’re unwilling to do this because you’re hoping I’ll marry into your family instead of the other way around. Is that right?” Leylin completely saw through Freya.\\n\\n Deep inside, Freya still hoped to bring Leylin into the Blood Serpent family, but this was obviously not possible.\\n\\n The Leylin right now would definitely not agree to this at all. Even before he advanced, he would only get others to do as he wished, and there were never instances of others getting him to do something.\\n\\n One had to acknowledge that Leylin was a male chauvinist. He would marry Freya of his own accord, and not because he was thankful towards her. And he would definitely not marry into her family.\\n\\n “You know all this, but why…” Freya raised her head, face glimmering with tears as she protested.\\n\\n Seeing her reacting this way, Leylin knew that she had pretty much made up her mind, and couldn’t help but chuckle, “Because I am stronger than you! This is what you’re destined to do!”\\n\\n Strength ruled the Magus World. This was an undisputable truth.\\n\\n Since Freya had completely given in, Leylin softened his tone and began to console her, “Don’t worry. I will naturally take care of your family. When we have many children, I can even send a son over to the Blood Serpent family…”\\n\\n This was an attempt at pacifying her. Since Freya had done so much for Leylin, he had to pay her back. However, Leylin’s nature was such that he had to take the initiative, instead of being begged to act.\\n\\n Upon hearing this guarantee, Freya nodded, finally at ease.\\n\\n Leylin could tell that Freya had nodded slightly and agreed, and laughed heartily at that.\\n\\n ……\\n\\n The battle that happened at Phosphorescence Swamp swept through the central continent like a whirlwind.\\n\\n In particular, Leylin’s exceptional and powerful appearance, from how he had killed the Demon Hunter Cyril and caused his fall, increased the enthusiasm towards the situation till the extreme.\\n\\n Demon Hunter Cyril was not a nobody, even amongst the Morning Star circles. Rather, his strength had been proven to surpass the masses, and as a newly-advanced Morning Star Warlock, Leylin had been able to cause his downfall. Such strength immediately led to the dread of other Morning Star Magi.\\n\\n From the outside, it seemed like not only had the allied armies that had attacked the Ouroboros Clan completely withdrawn from key regions such as Phosphorescence Swamp, they had even drawn a certain line of isolation, seemingly wanting to avoid conflict.\\n\\n After the fall of the main body of Morning Star Magus Cyril, Nefas, the city of sin, fell into a state of confusion. The Magi there weren’t good people from the start, and mostly comprised of vicious bandits and those with death warrants for them. Without Cyril’s suppression, the place grew rife with violence.\\n\\n The areas surrounding Nefas gradually descended further into chaos as news about the death of Cyril’s clone came in, confirming his fall.\\n\\n In that period, spells flew everywhere in the city, and the architecture was engulfed in a sea of flames.\\n\\n As many Demon Magi gleefully broke into Cyril’s Magus Tower and were prepared to loot the place as they wished, a large number of elite Magus armies suddenly descended upon them.\\n\\n Under the suppression of the Magus army, as well as with a Morning Star Magus’ help, the chaos in Nefas died down.\\n\\n After losing the deterring power of Cyril, the defenceless Nefas had basically turned into a giant gold mine, attracting the interests of many Morning Star Magi.\\n\\n This was especially true for those few Morning Star Magi in the original allied army. In the name of their comrades, they dispatched forces and took over the city, making up for all their previous losses.\\n\\n By the time the matter with Nefas had died down, an even more startling piece of news spread throughout the central continent.\\n\\n The one who had caused Cyril’s fall based on his own strength, and thus protected the Ouroboros Clan, the Morning Star Magus Leylin Farlier, had invited many friendly organisations to his Morning Star ceremony.\\n\\n In response to this invitation, many large-scaled organisations who had intentionally kept a distance due to their disdain towards the Ouroboros Clan saw a chance to repair this relationship and sent people to attend.\\n\\n Other organisations also saw the ceremony as a great chance to figure out the situation within the Ouroboros Clan, and to better understand Leylin’s strength. They, too, sent out spies or envoys.\\n\\n During that time, numerous Magi hurried towards Phosphorescence Swamp, causing the swamp to be bustling with life, a huge contrast from the normal deathly silence.\\n\\n ……\\n\\n Within the city headquarters, Leylin reclined on the couch comfortably, listening to the female Magus reporting from beside him.\\n\\n “The messengers we sent out have mostly returned with positive replies. Most of the emissaries of those organisations have already set out. Recently, Phosphorescence Swamp has not been very orderly. Though preparations for the ceremony are completed, I think it’s necessary to prepare a few emergency contingencies…”\\n\\n Freya leant against the couch while holding countless files and wearing a pair of frameless glasses, seemingly very busy.\\n\\n “Let’s do as you say!”\\n\\n “Also, the bloodline Warlocks from Spirit Circle and Wind Wolf Lair are about to reach headquarters. You need to take some time out to meet them…” After finishing her report, Freya laughed delicately and moved away from the couch, leaving quickly.\\n\\n After she left, Leylin’s expression turned serious. He put on white gloves and produced a broken sword. This sword had the style of casting in ancient times. It was cold and sharp, and even time could do nothing to weaken its firmness. There were even traces of golden-coloured blood on the blade.\\n\\n “I never expected for the bloodline of the Sun’s child and the Wing of the Sun to reach my hands…” Sensing the powerful bloodline strength on the sword’s hilt, a hint of a smile revealed about Leylin’s lips.\\n\\n This broken sword was one of the treasures from the Azure Mountain auction. Cyril had shamelessly used his status and pressurised others so he could purchase it.\\n\\n Leylin had really wanted to get his hands on it, but for one he did not have enough magic crystals. On top of that, he did not dare go head to head with Cyril. However, this was no longer an issue.\\n\\n Even Cyril’s main body had fallen at Leylin’s hands. The items he had hoarded and brought along on his body had naturally been kindly accepted by Leylin. Besides many precious materials and countless magic crystals, what he’d really desired was this item.\\n\\n [Beep! Top-grade meditation technique, Wing of the Sun recorded!] The A.I. Chip transmitted.\\n\\n “Hopefully it’s useful for Kemoyin’s Pupil.” Leylin sighed, keeping the giant sword well.\\n\\n Kemoyin’s Pupil was merely a high-grade meditation technique with the fourth level as the limit. It was impossible to progress further. For Leylin, this was absolutely unacceptable.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-508","bookId":1513,"book":{"id":1513,"title":"Warlock of the Magus World","description":"What happens when a scientist from a futuristic world reincarnates in a World of Magic and Knights?\\n An awesome MC — that’s what happens!\\n A scientist’s goal is to explore the secrets of the universe, and this is exactly what Leylin sets out to do when he is reincarnated.
