{"id":59032,"no":476,"title":"Chapter 476","content":"Invincible\n “Surround them! Formation number 2!” Under Freya’s command, the Blood Serpent Organisation firmly trapped the three other Crystal Phase Magi in a formation.\n With their own strength and the assistance of Julian’s expertise in sneak attacks, the three Crystal Phase Magi in the formation were immediately surrounded by danger.\n “It’s your turn now!” Seeing that the three Magi had no hope of escaping, Leylin turned towards Hill and Fein on the opposite end, a brilliant smile spreading across his face.\n To the two Magi on the other end, though, this smile was more frightening than that of a demon’s.\n Upon seeing Leylin’s grin, they knew that he definitely would not let them off, and immediately rushed to take action first.\n The moment Hill had that thought, numerous black thorns instantly appeared, bursting forth in the blink of an eye.\n “Umbra Sting!” The many sharp thorns screeched across the sky and scattered down like a torrential rain of spikes.\n “Useless!” A layer of dense scales emerged on Leylin’s body. All that the thorns could do on collision with these scales was make a loud noise before snapping apart, merely causing white specks to appear on the black scales.\n Leylin’s physique had always been extremely shocking, and the current him could practically fight against any rank 1 or rank 2 Magus with his body alone. With the addition of the Kemoyin scales that strengthened his defense, even if he went up against a rank 3 Magus in the Crystal Phase, any spells used against him would have nearly no effect unless they were prepared over a long time.\n In the middle of the black rain, Leylin seemed to have transformed into a giant savage beast, advancing while sheltered from the numerous sparks.\n This ferocious posture instantly scared the wits out of the two Magi.\n “What we do now? Quick, think of something!” Hill shouted at Fein next to him, cold sweat dripping down his forehead.\n He was very clear on how terrifying the effects of his spell were, but the other party had unexpectedly resisted it with a mere layer of scales. How strong was his body?\n Perhaps only the legendary Morning Star Magi, whose bodies had been transformed by soul force, could compare to him.\n “Gaia’s Cage!” Fein did not waste any time either. A multitude of yellow crystals appeared around him as he muttered a long unintelligible chant without pause.\n When he was done chanting, the earth shook, causing the soil to disintegrate and reveal a sparkling jade structure within.\n A cage brimming with the resplendent radiance of a gem suddenly fell upon Leylin, covering him and trapping him inside.\n “Earth Elves! Listen to my instructions, bury him completely in the abyss…”\n A cheery look briefly appeared on Fein’s face before he hurriedly started casting more spells as numerous rays of dull yellow light flashed. Large amounts of soil coagulated to form an even bigger rock that buried him inside. The earth even started to crack apart, as though wanting to swallow up the cage deep into itself.\n “Well done, Fein!” Hill, who was on the other side, immediately yelled excitedly, but then saw his comrade’s forced smile.\n “Be careful! He’s struggling inside, I can’t control it any longer!” Following loud thumps that made one’s heart palpitate, the numerous rocks swelled and broke apart to form huge cracks.\n The many cracks then connected to each other and broken rocks suddenly fell everywhere, as though there was a dreadful creature locked up inside that was struggling so hard with mere brute force that the entire cage seemed to have gotten misshaped.\n With every thump, Fein’s expression grew a little paler, as though he was getting punched hard. By the end of his chant, he spat out large mouthfuls of fresh blood, and almost looked like he was dead.\n “The… The seal!” Fein tried his best to say as blood gushed out in large amounts from the corner of his mouth.\n *Boom!* The very mountains shook, and the huge cage of rock was sent into the cracks just before everything completely fell apart. The earth slowly closed up.\n “Great!” Hill cheered, finally managing to let his guard down.\n *Thump!* At this moment, he saw his comrade Fein faint, as though he had already used up all of his energy.\n “Don\u0027t worry, buddy! I’ll take you away now!”\n Hill’s eyes flickered in multiple colours. Peering over at the few black silhouettes belonging to the Blood Serpent Warlock Organisation who were not far away, he gritted his teeth and left quickly.\n “Master?” Julian looked over at the location where Leylin had been buried, “Aren\u0027t we going to help?”\n “Don\u0027t worry. That fellow has never been blocked by an obstacle, he definitely still has something up his sleeve!” Freya rolled her eyes, “Why are you speaking up for him all of a sudden? You clearly approved of the ceasefire previously!”\n ‘That was when I didn\u0027t know that the other party was so perverse!’ Julian secretly criticised, but did not dare to express it in words.\n “Lord Leylin actually revealed his true ability and will likely be the biggest hope in our clan. It will definitely grant him a status much higher than before...”\n The highest authority in the Ouroboros Clan belonged to the three Morning Star Warlock elders, followed by a whole bunch of bloodline Marquises among whom the ownership was split.\n But Julian knew that above these ordinary bloodline Marquises were actually a special group of people!\n They were young Warlocks— children who had already achieved the Crystal Phase and had hopes of advancing to the Morning Star realm! Such people were few and far between in the entire Ouroboros Clan. Their status was only lower than that of the few rank 4 Warlocks, and they were provided with the best resources, aiming for nothing less than advancing to Morning Star.\n Although Robin was Gilbert’s main steward, his actual position was previously lower than these seeds by a notch.\n Of course, after getting some unknown profits, his strength had improved tremendously, and upon entering the Crystal Phase, Robin was on par with the others.\n Now that Leylin had shown that his potential was not inferior to Robin’s, exceeding it in fact, he would definitely receive more attention from Duke Gilbert!\n “Now it seems that when Master met him for the first time, you had already discovered that he wasn\u0027t ordinary. Your foresight indeed exceeds that of an average person!” Julian expressed his respect sincerely, making Freya blush.\n “You want to leave? Have you even asked me?”\n *Boom!* The rock exploded, exposing a deep gaping hole in the ground.\n A black figure forced his way out recklessly, causing rocks to fly everywhere.\n “Ley… Leylin!” Hill gazed at Fein who had already fainted on the ground, but couldn\u0027t even bring himself to cry.\n At the bottom of his heart, he had already cursed at the people in charge who initially made this plan. How stupid were they to have put their sights on Leylin, such a ferocious person?\n But he didn\u0027t have much chance to think about it. Leylin, who was exuding a brazen aura, had already appeared in front of him.\n “My Lord! Spare us…” Hill’s voice distorted, and various accessories on his person exploded, forming many layers of radiant armor that floated around his body.\n “When you dared to ambush me back then, you should have expected to be killed!” Leylin’s was callous. In a situation where Morning Star Magi would not appear, there were few things that could constrain him.\n After all, since he was unable to continue hiding his strength, he had to ruthlessly display it and intimidate the rest who wanted to go against him.\n *Thump!* A black fist attacked the outermost barrier of light, smashing it into pieces. The other layers of defence immediately started tottering, on the verge of collapse.\n “My Lord! I am willing to reveal the mastermind behind all this!” Hill gritted his teeth and finally pulled out his trump card.\n “Not interested!” Leylin really was not interested in probing behind the scenes. War was almost upon them, and it would be easiest to build an atmosphere full of panic by assassinations and by getting rid of the other party’s weaker troops.\n He didn’t want to be implicated and end up provoking a Morning Star Magus.\n Right now, as long as he firmly broke the claws that the other party was reaching out with, it would be enough!\n After sorting out his thoughts, Leylin appeared even more apathetic, and was indifferent to the other party’s pleas for forgiveness. He eventually ripped apart Hill’s innate defence under his despairing gaze.\n A sinister-looking head fell onto the ground with a thump even as the body it was previously attached to let loose a shower of blood. It looked like a red fountain had erupted.\n ‘As for this… I’ll leave it to her.’ Leylin instantly thought of Freya. Fein, who was still unconscious and lying on the ground, would still take some effort to deal with.\n Upon inspection, he discovered that Fein’s spiritual force had been exhausted, and swiftly removed all of his spatial objects before forcing his consciousness shut.\n With his magic equipment and potions all taken away, and his spiritual force sealed, even if Fein was a Magus in the Crystal Phase, he wouldn’t be able to do anything.\n *Hiss…* On the other end of the battlefield, in the spell formation formed by the Blood Serpent Organisation, the battle was at its most heated moment.\n Although the Blood Serpent Organisation was comprised of the elites of Freya’s family, who were also proficient in many types of formations, Freya had discovered to her surprise that the three Crystal Phase Magi were also experts in all kinds of terrifying secret techniques. Through combining their strength, those Magi had managed to survive the assault of her troops until now, even if they were trapped in a formation.\n The three Crystal Phase Magi in front of Freya had now morphed into a monster.\n This monster was thrice the size of a normal human, had three heads and six arms, and its body was covered with moving black runes. It looked as though it was a fusion of the three Magi.\n The head of an elderly man placed right in the centre opened its eyes and issued its last warning to Freya. “Let us go! You don’t want to pay the price for detaining us!”\n “Don’t trust him!” A corner of the spell formation split apart, allowing a ray of light to enter. Leylin stood beside Freya.\n “Hill and company have already been completely destroyed, and you still wish to leave? Dream on!” Leylin naturally reprimanded his enemies without restraint.\n Seeing that the fused Magi appeared to have made suspicious movements, Leylin immediately turned to Freya.\n “You’re in charge of controlling the spell formation, I’ll take care of the front!” he said and then dashed away.\n The spell formation of the Warlock organisation was not bad, but Leylin was clear that what it lacked was a pivot who would dare to fight against the other party head on.\n His rays of death had been prepared long ago, flickering with a dreadful lustre...\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-476","bookId":1513,"book":{"id":1513,"title":"Warlock of the Magus World","description":"What happens when a scientist from a futuristic world reincarnates in a World of Magic and Knights?\n An awesome MC — that’s what happens!\n A scientist’s goal is to explore the secrets of the universe, and this is exactly what Leylin sets out to do when he is reincarnated.
