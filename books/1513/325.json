Instead, it crawled to the top of a mound and used its large pincers to dig at the mound, revealing a nest with numerous holes that made it look like a honeycomb.\\n\\n In it were large numbers of orderly lined up white eggs.\\n\\n *Chi chi!* The Icy Jade Scorpion gave a cry of exultation and began to pig out.\\n\\n “My apologies, but I’ll need to disturb you for a while!”\\n\\n Its feeding time had been interrupted by another being. The tiny red eyes of the Icy Jade Scorpion fixed were fixed on the human figure in front of him, its two large pincers constantly flying in the air and its poisonous stinger flexing behind its back.\\n\\n *Chi chi!* The Icy Jade Scorpion was instantly enraged by Leylin, who had disturbed its meal. Large amounts of icy mist was produced from its mouth and aimed at Leylin.\\n\\n *Ka-cha! Ka-cha!*\\n\\n The temperature in the cave lowered, as exposed rocks shattered into countless fragments whereever this icy mist passed by.\\n\\n “Extreme cold! The unique breath of the Icy Jade Scorpion is said to possess an ability from the Icy World.”\\n\\n Leylin muttered to himself while covered in the blue icy mist.\\n\\n Immediately after, the large amounts of blue gas vied to enter through Leylin’s skin.\\n\\n [Beep! Detected absorption of large amounts of icy energy. Extremely effective towards suppressing bloodline issue of emotional instability. Saved!]\\n\\n The A.I. Chip intoned.\\n\\n “It’s not enough! This level of iciness is not enough!”\\n\\n Slightly disappointed, Leylin shook his head. He then extended his right arm, at which large amounts of icy mist converged, forming a small spiral in the air.\\n\\n This sight caused the opposing Icy Jade Scorpion to pause its actions.\\n\\n *Ka-cha! Ka-cha!*\\n\\n The blue icy mist shrunk in Leylin’s hand, and its light blue lustre disappeared, revealing a pure hue.\\n\\n Minutes later, the Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath had completely disappeared from Leylin’s hand. Left over in his palm was a thin piece of ice that looked the same as what Celine had traded to him, though this shard was much smaller.\\n\\n “The crystal shard of the Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath!” Leylin glanced at the white icy shard in his hand and suddenly sighed. A silver ray of light flashed, and the icy shard suddenly disappeared from Leylin’s hand.\\n\\n “This Icy Jade Scorpion is still too weak, and its breath can only help in suppressing my emotions by a small amount. If I really want to cure myself, I’ll need to do tests on an even more powerful Icy Jade Scorpion.”\\n\\n Leylin looked at the Icy Jade Scorpion in front of him. As it spat out large amounts of chilly air, the surface of this large scorpion looked transparent, and it was looking at Leylin from afar, seemingly about to escape.\\n\\n “It still has a certain level of intelligence!” Seeing its behavior, Leylin was even more interested.\\n\\n “I need to obtain a complete experimental body, record its data, and gather some materials!”\\n\\n Leylin looked at this large scorpion that looked to be formed entirely out of green ice and broke out into a smile...\\n\\n Several hours later, in a large icy cave that had just been opened.\\n\\n The entrance to the cave had been sealed by Leylin. He had also used some concealment methods to prevent ordinary beings from discovering this place.\\n\\n On a large ice platform in the middle of the cave were tens of black iron pillars standing tall to form a cage. The Icy Jade Scorpion from before was kept inside, occasionally letting out low growls.\\n\\n Leylin off to a side, holding a petri dish that held a green shell within. This shell was from the exoskeleton of the Icy Jade Scorpion.\\n\\n *Drip drop!*\\n\\n A droplet of red liquid was dripped onto the surface of the icy shell, causing the shard to begin to boil and produce large amounts of steam. The shell constantly melted until all that was left was a black fragment.\\n\\n Leylin was delighted upon seeing this. A glimmer of excitement appeared in his eyes, and he used a pair of tweezers to transfer this fragment to a test tube.\\n\\n “I’ve pretty much gathered all of the samples and data. All that’s left is to gather data on the Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath.”\\n\\n Leylin glanced at the Icy Jade Scorpion in the cage and suddenly clapped.\\n\\n *Pak pak!* Large amounts of sparks flashed at the top of the black iron cage, and blue streaks of electricity whizzed on the pillars, reaching the body of the Icy Jade Scorpion.\\n\\n *Chi chi!* Enraged, the Icy Jade Scorpion growled and spat out large amounts of chilly air.\\n\\n This chilly air formed a thick layer of frost on the metal cage, but most of it automatically drifted to Leylin, forming another one of the white crystallised ice shards from before.\\n\\n “Effects of electrostimulation: Excellent! Next is to try flames…”\\n\\n Leylin snapped his fingers and black flames ascended, as vibrant red tongues of flames extended and engulfed the Icy Jade Scorpion...\\n\\n After extensive experimentation, Leylin finally gathered the information he needed regarding the Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath.\\n\\n “Matured scorpions can spit out this extreme chilly air attack 5 or 6 times a day. Each time, the amount can form a shard that is a tenth of the size of what Celine gave me.”\\n\\n Leylin glanced at the Icy Jade Scorpion in the cage.\\n\\n The scorpion currently had its pincers trailing on the ground, looking lifeless. The green on its body had almost disappeared, turning it into almost a translucent crystal scorpion.\\n\\n Due to its characteristics, Leylin wondered once again if he should confine a few Icy Jade Scorpions, but quickly discarded the idea.\\n\\n Based on the information he had gathered from Celine and Siegfried; these Icy Jade Scorpions could only survive in the icy caves. The moment they left, they would immediately die. Should they survive, their later generations would slowly turn degenerate.\\n\\n The Icy Jade Scorpions could only maintain their unique properties while living in the icy caves.\\n\\n In addition, though these beings had some intelligence, they were very obstinate, or rather, fascinating! This was because Leylin had found a control mechanism inside its sea of consciousness!\\n\\n Protect this place. Protect the queen! Such determination seemed to be passed down with its bloodline, constantly existing in its mind. If Leylin wished to expel this brand, he would need to destroy its sea of consciousness. However, the Icy Jade Scorpion have long since died, which would render this whole effort meaningless.\\n\\n “They are so tightly bound as a group!” Such a strange control over them made it difficult for Leylin to understand.\\n\\n In wolf packs, there were instances of the alpha males being chased out after losing in a battle for power. However, the Icy Jade Scorpion made Leylin think more of queen bees or queen ants. Only in these sorts of simple organisms would there be a situation of ultimate power and control.\\n\\n “It looks like there’s a need to go to the nest of the Icy Jade Scorpions!”\\n\\n Leylin muttered to himself while looking at the Icy Jade Scorpion trapped in the cage.\\n\\n Though he could occasionally come over and gather the breath of the Icy Jade Scorpion to suppress the issue with his bloodline, he could not truly cure it.\\n\\n What he wished for was something that could completely eliminate all of the negative emotions from his body!\\n\\n It wasn’t really a matter of convenience, but rather, it was the fact that it was a weak point that others could target at any time. Leylin wasn’t going to be so stupid as to let it be.\\n\\n It was evident that just the Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath could not achieve this. Leylin could only place his attention on the elites that were a rank higher than this Icy Jade Scorpion, or even their emperor...\\n\\n With this thought, Leylin immediately got to work.\\n\\n Using the information he had gathered from the body of the Icy Jade Scorpion, he produced a few materials from his spatial pouch and created some powder that was specifically useful against Icy Jade Scorpions.\\n\\n This powder would produce a unique smell after being burnt, which was an indescribable temptation to Icy Jade Scorpions.\\n\\n With this powder, Leylin walked around the region where Icy Jade Scorpions were active and caught over ten regular Icy Jade Scorpions, and even an elite as well.\\n\\n Elite Icy Jade Scorpions were bigger than the regular Icy Jade Scorpions by a factor of almost 1.5 times. Their jade-like bodies were also covered with mysterious patterns.\\n\\n These patterns covering the back of these elite Icy Jade Scorpions were curses, but they were incomplete, causing Leylin to be puzzled.\\n\\n All Leylin could do was get the A.I. Chip to record these images so that he could do research on them in the future.\\n\\n These elite Icy Jade Scorpions were almost as powerful as semi-converted Magi. With the added bonus of being in the icy caves, their strength was even further amplified.\\n\\n However, in front of Leylin, who had now regained enough of his power to be equivalent to a peak rank 1 Magus, it was like snow that had been exposed in front of the sun, allowing him to obtain many good research materials.\\n\\n The quality of the elite Icy Jade Scorpion’s Breath was far above that of regular ones. It was enough to suppress the negative emotions caused by his bloodline for ten years, which filled Leylin with more hope of being able to completely rid himself of it!\\n\\n Leylin was now hidden behind an icy plain, watching a group of Icy Jade Scorpions that were migrating.\\n\\n There were tens of Icy Jade Scorpions gathered here, and with Leylin’s interference, about half of them had left the area. Moreover, these were all matured bodies!\\n\\n The entire group went berserk for a period of time, but even after sweeping through the area, they still could not find any traces of Leylin.\\n\\n The Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor could not do anything but choose to migrate to another location.\\n\\n However, this was exactly what Leylin had planned on.\\n\\n Previously, the Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor had hidden in a nest that was heavily guarded by numerous elite Icy Jade Scorpion guards. The moment there was any situation, Leylin would immediately be met with the attacks from the entire family.\\n\\n The Icy Jade Scorpion Emperor was akin to the existence of a peak rank 1 Magus. Along with the tens of Icy Jade Scorpions, all of which had the strength of official Magi, peak rank 1 human Magi would almost certainly die. Even if it was Leylin, it would be difficult if he could not use his full power as a rank 2 Warlock.\\n\\n However, the situation had changed!\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-325","bookId":1513,"book":{"id":1513,"title":"Warlock of the Magus World","description":"What happens when a scientist from a futuristic world reincarnates in a World of Magic and Knights?\\n An awesome MC — that’s what happens!\\n A scientist’s goal is to explore the secrets of the universe, and this is exactly what Leylin sets out to do when he is reincarnated.
