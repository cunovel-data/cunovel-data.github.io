Alert! Host body is currently in critical condition! Estimated time until cells completely fall apart from the pull of space: 8 seconds!]\\n\\n The A.I. Chip projected a paragraph of red words in front of Leylin’s eyes.\\n\\n “This is happening even with the sturdiness of my body! What method did ancient Magi use to deal with the power of space?”\\n\\n Leylin’s expression suddenly turned sinister, his veins all popping out and his eyes turning red.\\n\\n Just as the A.I. Chip counted down to the last second, the silver rays of light dissipated to reveal a pitch-black cave.\\n\\n Leylin’s mind jolted and he rushed towards the cave.\\n\\n *Bo!* As if penetrating a shapeless water membrane, Leylin arrived in a physical world, and the immense pressure from space vanished.\\n\\n “That was close!” It was all a blur in front of Leylin’s eyes. With all his strength, he drew a red line and destroyed the runel on the spell formation beneath his feet, and went into a dead faint.\\n\\n *Drip! Drip!*\\n\\n The stalactite above him in the cave constantly dripped light red droplets that fell on the ground, producing a rhythmic sound.\\n\\n Leylin’s eyelids flickered and he opened his eves.\\n\\n “Ugh!” He held onto his forehead, feeling the pain that was all over his body.\\n\\n “A.I. Chip! Check my current stats!”\\n\\n Leylin immediately spoke inside.\\n\\n [Leylin Farlier. Rank 2 Warlock, Bloodline: Giant Kemoyin Serpent. Strength: 15 (21.1), Agility: 4 (14.4), Vitality: 19 (27.9), Spiritual force: 0.01 (104.3), Magic power: 0 (104) (Magic power is in synchronisation with spiritual force). Status: Serious injuries all over body, exhaustion of spiritual force!]\\n\\n The A.I. Chip quickly intoned. At the sight of his condition, Leylin could only force a wry smile.\\n\\n As he had underestimated the dangers of spatial teleportation, he had not made enough preparations. This trip through the spatial passageway had almost cost him his life.\\n\\n Not only had his overall stats decreased, even his spiritual force had been nearly completely exhausted.\\n\\n This state would probably spell the end for regular Magi. However, Leylin had a shocking vitality, and was even able to maintain his consciousness.\\n\\n “I really got seriously hurt! Alric, I will return one day…”\\n\\n A cold glint appeared in Leylin’s eyes, and he shifted his gaze to his waist.\\n\\n Seeing that the black leather pouch was still there, a look of relief appeared on his face.\\n\\n This spatial leather pouch was a high-grade magic artifact. Though it did not have any offensive powers, its own defence was extremely startling, and with the spatial runes on the surface protecting it, it was not the least bit damaged\\n\\n Thankfully this was the case, if not all of Leylin’s assets would have vanished into thin air.\\n\\n “Any regular Magus lucky enough to survive my injuries would also require a large amount of time to restore their strength. Their strength might even go down a rank from the injuries!”\\n\\n Leylin checked the state of his body. Though there were serious injuries all around, he could feel a cold stream of air full of life and vigour being sent out from his heart. With his blood being pumped to all parts of his body, the stream of air within began to help heal his injuries. Though this process was very slow, the good thing was that this was a continuous process.\\n\\n “The regenerative abilities of a warlock’s bloodline are this powerful!” A hint of joy was seen in Leylin’s eyes, “With the potions that I currently possess, I can even further increase the speed of my healing…”\\n\\n With this thought, he expended a great deal of effort to raise the only limb that he could move, his right arm, and took out a red healing potion from the pouch. He used his teeth to remove the cork and, began to drink in huge gulps.\\n\\n *Rumble!* A pink layer of light encompassed Leylin.\\n\\n Due to the effects of the layer, the horrifying injuries on his body began to recover at a frightening speed.\\n\\n *Ka-cha! Crack!* From Leylin’s body, the sounds of bones hitting each other could constantly be heard.\\n\\n The muscles on his face constantly twitched, and he huffed through his nose; even his breathing was becoming more serious.\\n\\n After a few minutes of this, the pink layer on Leylin’s body dissipated. *Pak!* Leylin soared into the sky, and from his previous position of half-sitting on the spell formation, he was now standing upright.\\n\\n “All of my external injuries have now been healed. Though the internal injuries are a lot more troublesome, they wont affect simple movements!”\\n\\n Leylin exercised his four limbs, did a few motions that were standard in Knight drills, and furrowed his brows.\\n\\n “No! With my body, I can only withstand the movements equivalent to that of a Preparatory Knight. If not, it would affect the recovery of my internal injuries…”\\n\\n In other words, before his injuries were completely healed, Leylin could only use the strength and speed of a Preparatory Knight.\\n\\n Leylin touched his skin, retrieving armour from his pouch and putting it on.\\n\\n His Magus robes had been torn apart by the pressure of the space, and they had long since turned into what looked like a beggar’s rags, hanging from his body while being full of holes. Leylin simply tore his old clothes off.\\n\\n After inspecting his body, Leylin focused his attention on the sea of consciousness within.\\n\\n The state within was even worse. As a large amount of spiritual force had been used, his sea of consciousness even showed signs of drying up. The crimson colour had turned dimmer, and there wasn’t even a hint of silver spiritual force.\\n\\n Leylin’s expression immediately turned grim, as even fine cracks had appeared on the walls of his sea of consciousness. If his sea of consciousness shattered, it wouldn’t be as simple as falling in rank.\\n\\n Upon seeing a little white ray still stuck in a corner in the sea of consciousness, Leylin’s face turned even darker.\\n\\n This was the mark that Alric had left on Jajone’s body. After Leylin had killed Jajone, this mark had transferred itself to Leylin’s sea of consciousness, sticking like a piece of sticky candy. No matter what Leylin did, it just would not disappear.\\n\\n The only way to deal with this sort of mark was to use large amounts of spiritual force and slowly wear it down. Though it was from a rank 3 Magus, they were currently a huge distance apart, and without boosts from the original Magus, the mark would not be able to persist under Leylin’s spiritual force. However, this required a lot of time, which Leylin did not have.\\n\\n Now, however, it seemed like this was the time to deal with this thorn in his side!\\n\\n Leylin sat down cross-legged, recalling the core information regarding the high grade meditation technique, Kemoyin’s Pupil. “Meditation in your spirit. With your eyes, make eye contact with the Giant Kemoyin Serpent and gain its strength!”\\n\\n The daily training of meditation techniques was something every Magus had to do. Every time Leylin used Kemoyin’s Pupil, adjusting the frequency of his spiritual force until it was the most compatible with the operation of the meditation technique, he was able to penetrate through time and space and see the ancient, terrifying amber vertical pupils of the Giant Kemoyin Serpent!\\n\\n This state was a phenomenon written about in the Book of Giant Serpent, which only occurred after one had studied it to a very profound level.\\n\\n As Leylin meditated to a deeper level, the crimson rays in his sea of consciousness gradually grew stronger, and traces of silver spiritual force welled from the bottom from his sea of consciousness, refilling the dried up spring with new vitality.\\n\\n In the dark cave, spots of dark red light fluttered in the air like fireflies, and entered Leylin’s body. This entire process was silent, but the terrifying apparition of a giant serpent appeared behind Leylin. The huge body kept rotating, becoming more and more substantial physically.\\n\\n After one round of meditating, Leylin had regained half of his spiritual force, and a look of satisfaction appeared on his face.\\n\\n “As expected of a high-grade meditation technique! Whether in terms of rate of improvement or recovery, it’s the best on the south coast! It’s a pity that there are only three levels…”\\n\\n Worry appeared on Leylin’s face\\n\\n Though Kemoyin’s Pupil was a high-grade meditation technique, of all the inheritance he had gained from the Great Magus Serholm, there were only three levels of information.\\n\\n The level of a high-grade meditation technique and a Magus’ rank corresponded to one another. In other words, unless he could find the rest of the information regarding Kemoyin’s Pupil, his spiritual force would be at a standstill due to the lack of a meditation technique.\\n\\n “Based on the information that the Great Magus Serholm provided, the second half of Kemoyin’s Pupil should be on the central continent. Where exactly am I right now?”\\n\\n Leylin stood up, surveying his surroundings\\n\\n “I’ll go out and take a look! Hopefully, this is the central continent! Before anything else… A.I. Chip, are there any remedies for the damage to my sea of consciousness and the mark by the rank 3 Magus?”\\n\\n Leylin enquired in his mind.\\n\\n Large amounts of data, images and graphs flashed past, and the A.I. Chip worked at an extremely high speed, quickly giving an answer.\\n\\n [Based on Host body’s requirements, as well as comprehensive calculations of current conditions, this is the best solution: solidify large amounts of spiritual force in Host body’s sea of consciousness, until all damage is healed and the mark completely disappears.\\n\\n “Solidify large amounts of spiritual force?”\\n\\n Leylin was surprised. This meant that before all his injuries were recovered, he would always need to solidify a portion of his spiritual force in his sea of consciousness, and would not be able to use that part at all.\\n\\n In that case, his overall strength would largely diminish.\\n\\n “How much do I need to solidify?” Leylin glanced at the cracks that were constantly expanding in his sea of consciousness, face falling while he asked cool-headedly.\\n\\n [Requires 51.2% of Host’s spiritual force!] The A.I. Chip quickly answered.\\n\\n In other words, before completely taking care of all damages, I can only use the strength of a rank 1 Magus?”\\n\\n Leylin stroked his chin.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-288","bookId":1513,"book":{"id":1513,"title":"Warlock of the Magus World","description":"What happens when a scientist from a futuristic world reincarnates in a World of Magic and Knights?\\n An awesome MC — that’s what happens!\\n A scientist’s goal is to explore the secrets of the universe, and this is exactly what Leylin sets out to do when he is reincarnated.
