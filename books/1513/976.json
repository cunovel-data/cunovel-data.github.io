{"id":59532,"no":976,"title":"Chapter 976","content":"Distorted Shadow\n “Great!” Leylin clapped and removed the restraints on Ilyo. “Since you’ve chosen to be subservient to me, then we’re on the same side. There’s no need for a contract or anything like that…”\n That’s what Leylin had said, but he nonchalantly kept the phylactery into his dimensional pouch under the desolate gaze of the lich.\n Compared to any promises, this was the ultimate restraint! With the phylactery, Leylin had plenty of ways to make Ilyo wish he were dead. He knew full well that Ilyo would never dare betray him.\n On the other hand, if he were to just give the phylactery back to Ilyo, it was unclear what would happen.\n “I will give you part of grade 2 control over the floating city. From hereon, you’ll focus on maintaining the arcane gardens and the golems. Shaylin will transfer the information to you soon…”\n Leylin waved his hands.\n Since Ilyo was now his subordinate, it was natural that he use the lich as much as possible. After all, this was a scholarly-type wizard, and was probably very useful if nurtured.\n Ilyo laughed wryly in answer. If this were in the past and he had countless information as well as authority over the floating city in front of him, he would definitely go crazy in his elation. However, if the price was losing his freedom… That was a little too much...\n “Understood, Ma- Master!”\n “Shaylin!”\n After Ilyo left, Leylin commanded the intellectual core.\n “While he’s submitted already, it’s still necessary to monitor him. In addition, if he ever gets near the Mise energy core power room or any grade 1 important areas, I give you permission to kill him immediately!”\n “Recorded into main procedures!”\n Shaylin looked to have human emotions, but in essence, was an intellectual body formed of a bunch of codes. Her primary goal being to carry out her master’s orders, she never hesitated when it came to Leylin’s orders.\n “Mm. I want some peace now…”\n After taking care of all these matters, the floating city was now far from danger and under Leylin’s control.\n It was only now that Leylin finally had some idle time.\n After the flower elf, Shaylin left, it completely went silent. Only the arcane spell lights emitted tender rays of light.\n With a flash of silver light at his right hand, the scroll Leylin had obtained from the Netheril Ruins appeared.\n “Ancient Distorted Shadow… What do you want…”\n The rays from the A.I. Chip shone in Leylin’s eyes, “A.I. Chip, how’s is the research on this going?”\n After getting control over the city, the Mise energy core’s tremendous power had seemed to unseal something in the scroll and given Leylin a terrifyingly complicated arcane spell model to him.\n Leylin had been using the A.I. Chip to decode it, and only now did he get some idea of what it was.\n [Beep! Progress of arcane spell model analysis at 100%. Displaying quantified information.]\n After which, the complicated numerical data of the spell model showed itself before him.\n [Arcane spell name: Karsus’ Avatar. Rank 12 arcane spell (???) Effects: Allows the caster to substitute the Weave Goddess and take over control of the Weave. (Minimum requirements: Great Arcanist, 100% analysis of level 7 Weave.) Description: This is a mysterious arcane spell. With the caster’s understanding of the Weave, its might changes. Grasping it allows you to become a powerful higher god in an instant!]\n “An arcane spell that surpasses even a legendary arcane spell… Allowing me to become a powerful higher god in an instant?”\n Leylin’s eyes widened and he stroked his chin, smiling slightly, “Interesting! How… interesting…”\n An arcane spell of this grade was obviously not something developed by those great arcanists, but a spell of the Magus World that a peak rank 8 like Distorted Shadow could design.\n “This arcane spell model already is out of the domain of arcane spells. It can only be explained with spells from the Magus world. It’s at least a powerful rank 7 spell…”\n Leylin muttered to himself. Even his main body only grasped one rank 7 spell, which was Alternate World Incarnation, which already had an astounding effect.\n “It’s at least a rank 7 spell there. If the caster’s understanding of the Weave has reached 100% of level 9, that would make this a rank 8 or 9 spell in the Magus World…”\n Leylin gasped in awe.\n Allowing the spell caster to replace the Weave Goddess and obtain control all of the Weave… What was this?\n Based on the rankings of the Magi, that would be like making a Morning Star Magus a peak rank 8 Magus in a moment. That was might comparable to Distorted Shadow, Nightmare King and the Mother Core!\n “But… can a frail spirit and mind take on such power? The only probable outcome would be getting control of the Weave and becoming a greater god for a moment, and then dying from the tremendous amount of information and energy being transmitted over. It’ll be like a child who decided to touch a high-voltage power grid…”\n Leylin now looked grim, “Even if it’s my main body of a semi-rank 7 Warlock and help form the A.I. Chip, I’ll only barely be able to control the Weave. Due to a difference in my godhood and divinity, my path will be contaminated and be corroded from the conscients of the other gods…”\n “But at least I finally know Distorted Shadow’s intentions. So he wants to destroy the Weave?”\n Even after death, a peak rank 8 Magus still could leave behind a conscient and not disappear even after hundreds of thousands of years. With a slight chance, he could be revived!\n Distorted Shadow seemed to have been setting up this plan before and even given Leylin great benefits at the Nightmare Island. That had made Leylin feel very uneasy.\n Now, he finally understood what Distorted Shadow had been planning!\n His goal was to destroy the World of God’s Weave!\n “Hehe… You really think rather well of me!”\n Leylin knew that besides being a channel for wizards’ spell slots, it was also used for the priests’ divine spells.\n The moment he showed his intentions, he would not only be viewed as an enemy by most wizards, but the Weave Goddess would immediately become his mortal enemy.\n The other gods would also not be willing to give up the convenient channel of faith through the weave.\n “This meant he would be going against the whole World of Gods!”\n “No wonder he chose me! Aside from an outsider like me, even devils or demons wouldn’t be willing to do this…”\n His eyes twinkled as he grabbed the beast hide scroll.\n “Unfortunately… I won’t be a pawn for you. If I do become one, I’ll do it as the player!”\n “Ancient Distorted Shadow… Did you think that your conscient could keep following me in the shadows?”\n Leylin spoke in the Magus World’s ancient Byron language, voice hoarse and activating a trace of the power of laws.\n After which, a formidable sealing force enveloped the hall. This was power he had from controlling the city.\n *Hss…*\n With immense support from the city and seal from another world, Leylin finally showed off his full strength. A Targaryen figure as large as a world appeared behind him.\n *Rumble…* In the remote, faraway Magus World, Leylin’s mighty semi-rank 7 body that had been in a deep sleep caused a magnitutde 8 earthquake and opened a slight channel, transferring streams of bloodline force over.\n *Hss…*\n A terrifying Targaryen with a single horn, devil fleshy wings and and two claws appeared behind him.\n There seemed to be slight changes to the Targaryen. There were now traces of dark red fog surrounding it, and its scales were turning dark red. In its eyes that were like stars, there was a blood-red line had seemed to form a third eye.\n “Did you think that I wouldn’t notice you doing something behind the shadows while I had bloodline power planted in me?”\n “Get out here!!!”\n Leylin yelled and tossed the beast skin scroll away, his clothes exploding open. Traces of black blood that had been contaminated streamed out from his pores.\n A distorted black shadow appeared in the sky, numerous tendrils at ths dies. It seemed to want to hold onto Leylin, but with Leylin’s yell and sudden powerful bloodline force, was forced out.\n *Xiu!*\n There was a sharp whistle in the sky, and the shadow that was Distorted Shadow clashed with the scroll, and then began to burn with phosphorescent green flames.\n The flames slowly turned black, and a distorted human figure soon appeared.\n “We finally meet… The ancient Distorted Shadow!”\n Leylin panted slightly, but he now felt extremely comfortable. Even his soul seemed to have been refreshed, and his connection to his followers’ prayers was now more distinct, as if he could produce divinity at any moment.\n “Tss… Your body and spirit fuse perfectly with bloodline force, tss.. No wonder the Nightmare chose you…”\n Ancient spiritual force sent over this information, similarly using the ancient Byron language.\n “Isn’t this great? There’s no exploitation whatsoever. We’re conversing on equal grounds…”\n Leylin watched Distorted Shadow in front of him, the Targaryen behind him spitting outs tongue, bloodline force created a dense armour over him.\n “Tss tss… Warlock! I need you to destroy the Weave. In return…. I can give you all the inheritances of primordial Magi…”\n He seemed to know that Leylin would be difficult to deal with, but more importantly, was aware of the terror of the powerful isolation force of the floating city. He gave up on conspiring anything and proposed a trade on equal grounds.\n “Fine, but I will choose when it will be done.”\n Leylin did not give even an inch, “What is inside the Weave? I can somewhat guess, but I need you to confirm it…”\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-976","bookId":1513,"book":{"id":1513,"title":"Warlock of the Magus World","description":"What happens when a scientist from a futuristic world reincarnates in a World of Magic and Knights?\n An awesome MC — that’s what happens!\n A scientist’s goal is to explore the secrets of the universe, and this is exactly what Leylin sets out to do when he is reincarnated.
