{"id":58977,"no":421,"title":"Chapter 421","content":"Sudden Entry\n Battles between Potions Masters depended most on their accumulated knowledge and recipes.\n For instance, had Leylin not recognised the type of potion that the Green-skinned Barbarian was using, it might have been a hindrance to him.\n The winner was determined by who managed to see through the other party’s setup.\n When it came to all this information, how could the Green-skinned Barbarian match up to Leylin, who possessed the A.I. Chip?\n “You-” The opposite Green-skinned Barbarian’s fingers began to shake, evidently in fear.\n “What? Are you planning to use the Star-traced amulet and activate the Icy Frost Potion above your waist, or are you going to use the Corrosive Poison Arrow Potion at your back?”\n Leylin measured up this Green-skinned Barbarian, obviously ridiculing it.\n “Oh! No, I think you’re doing this as a cover for you to activate your Wind Spirit’s Fury under your feet!”\n All sorts of expressions crossed the opposite Green-skinned Barbarian’s face, and it was truly difficult for it to have so many expressions and movements on his creased face. At the end, all this turned into terror.\n “Ah! You’re the devil! The devil!”\n The Green-skinned Potion Master yelled, and actually abandoned his race and companions, fleeing from the battle area first.\n It evidently had a very high status here. After seeing it flee, the other Green-skinned Barbarians were startled, and with some of them shouting at the top of their voices, they rapidly left the area.\n “Good job!” Robin, who was not far away, revealed a smile. He was the strongest of the three of them, and the opposite grey-robed Magus could only fend for himself.\n Kesha, who was on the other side, was not so lucky.\n When she had chosen her opponent, she had had no A.I. Chip and depended on her judgement. She had actually chosen the Barbarian Bear Shaman, which was likely at the Crystal Phase.\n This Barbarian Bear Shaman not only had unimaginable strength but also a tough body. Even Kesha’s Eye of Petrification could only hold it for a second and had no other effect.\n Rank 1 or two spells that struck it would char the fur, but there would be no substantial harm. As for rank 3 spells? Not only were such models difficult to get a hold of, to use them in the Forgotten Land required that one pay a huge price.\n Not everyone was a Potions Grandmaster like Leylin, who could use potions to simulate the effects of a rank 3 spell.\n *Wooh wooh!* At this moment, the skeleton flag on Barbarian Bear Shaman’s back suddenly exploded, sounding like a bugle horn.\n “Awoo awoo!” The surrounding Barbarian Bears who heard these sounds immediately roared frantically, eyes turning blood-red and their offensive abilities increasing by a large amount. Noah and the other Warlocks were immediately at a disadvantage.\n “They’re entering a frenzied state! Even regular Barbarian Bears are affected! How about that one?”\n Leylin immediately shifted his attention to the Barbarian Bear Shaman.\n Along with the sounds of the horn, the Barbarian Bear abruptly roared towards the skies, slapping its chest.\n Thick veins that were like old tree roots occupied its hands, chest, and back.\n *Ka-cha!* The skull of this Barbarian Bear cracked open, revealing a muscle similar to a brain that was beginning to glow with warmth.\n “Awoo!” Under its crazed roar, this Barbarian Bear Shaman’s body began to expand. Its body that was about two floors high became taller, turning into a gigantic humanoid bear-shaped monster.\n Energy undulations typically produced by Crystal Phase Magi burst out from the body of this giant Barbarian Bear.\n “Crystal—Crystal Phase!” Kesha looked pained.\n The Barbarian Bear monster obviously did not care about that. With its paw that could cover the heavens, it swiped at her!\n Under this terrifying might, the air seemed to solidify and began to attack Kesha.\n With a boom, Kesha’s figure was sent flying, slamming into numerous buildings.\n “Explosive Fireball!”\n Countless giant fireballs exploded on the Barbarian Bear’s head, but the groove with what seemed to be a brain was not the least bit damaged. All these attacks successfully incited the fury of the Barbarian Bear monster, and attracted its attention elsewhere.\n “Kesha, how is it? Are you dead yet?”\n “Who asks questions like that?” Bricks exploded, and Kesha’s figure appeared.\n However, she was not in a very good condition. Her clothes were tattered beyond repair, revealing dense snake scales. Kesha was now in her snake form, and not only did her Kemoyin’s Scales cover her entire body, even her pupils had elongated and turned vertical.\n Even with the most powerful defensive form of Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlocks, there was a huge wound on her arm and it was slightly twisted. Even her bones had issues.\n “I used a diversion technique and shifted most of the attack to my left hand.” Kesha revealed her mangled left arm and smiled wryly as she explained, “I didn’t expect that Barbarian Bear to be so fierce! It’s very dangerous today!”\n To be defeated by a creature that used brute force and its physique, it was a huge blow to her.\n Leylin smiled wryly and quickly pulled Kesha aside, dodging a large black foot.\n *Boom!* The building from before was smashed, leaving behind a gigantic footprint.\n “What we need to consider right now is how to get away from them. Besides, the support troops and Magi who we attracted before are coming this way. The traps we set up can’t hold them for too long, so we need a plan!”\n Leylin quickly told Kesha, his words reaching Robin who was a distance away.\n “Awoo!”\n At this moment, the giant Barbarian Bear monster was already destroying everything, whether it was its ally, the Green-skinned Barbarian, fallen Magi, Warlocks of the Ouroboros Clan or even Barbarian Bear warriors, all were attacked without distinction.\n “Ah!”\n A Black Horrall Snake Warlock was grasped in the palm of the gigantic Barbarian Bear monster, and produced miserable shrieks of fear.\n “You monster. Die!” His facial muscles twisted as he yelled, terrifying rays converging in his hands and turned into a large axe, striking down at it.\n *Ka-cha!*\n The axe, which had the terrifying might of a rank 3 spell made contact with the monster’s chest, and actually produced sparks.\n *Boom! Boom!* The Barbarian Bear monster took two steps back, shook its head, and continued roaring.\n With a swing of its arm, it threw the rank 3 Black Horrall Snake Warlock into its mouth and began to chew.\n *Gachi! Gachi!*\n Flesh, blood, organs and bones slid out from its mouth.\n The might of those jaws, as well as its physique and sharp teeth turned the Barbarian Bear monster’s mouth into a grinder, turning the Warlock into minced meat.\n “Oh no! Alfredo!”\n Noah screamed. It looked like yet another Warlock from his family had died, while Robin’s expression turned as gloomy as dark waters. When he saw a few rays about to catch up to them, his eyes revealed a steely determination.\n “Quick, get into the pocket dimension. I’ll bring up the rear,” he opened up his hand, “Illusory Terror!”\n Formless thin lines like a large web trapped all the human grey-robed Magi within. There were even all sorts of strange laughter being produced in the air.\n After that, he stood in front of the giant Barbarian Bear monster and helped Noah and the others stall for time.\n “The seal spell formation is completed.” At this moment, a Warlock who had been by the dark river called out.\n A scarlet rune launched from his finger and entered the whirlpool of the underground dark river.\n *Pila!* A giant blue web immediately appeared on the surface of the river.\n “Open!” Leylin’s eyes flickered with blue rays, his Meteor Sword streaking across with a strange arc and slashing at the web!\n Black light flashed, and the blue web immediately broke apart, revealing the black entrance to the pocket dimension in the whirlpool behind it.\n “Quick, quick, quick! Hurry up!” Many Warlocks immediately jumped into the whirlpool, and immediately disappeared with silver spatial rays.\n “Senior Robin, let’s go!”\n Leylin slashed at the area with the Meteor Sword and terrifying Kemoyin toxins appeared once more, before he unhesitatingly jumped into the whirlpool.\n “Awoo!” The giant Barbarian Bear monster’s eyes glinted with intelligence, and it charged towards Robin in a frenzy.\n “What a pity! This is something I only just got my hands on!”\n Robin took a look at the monster and tossed a black ball at it.\n *Pak!*\n Countless vines appeared in mid-air, with green shoots and leaves that formed a large green web that trapped it within.\n “Ball of Binding! This is a one-time use magic object passed down from ancient times. Even Crystal Phase Magi will be held back for at least a minute!” Robin sighed, and then jumped into the whirlpool.\n Silver-white rays flashed, and he disappeared.\n At this moment, a few splendid rays charged to the camp and the lights vanished, revealing the forms of a few people who looked terrible.\n “Douglas, stop, you idiot!” A Barbarian Bear with golden fur immediately went forward and roared using a unique method.\n This roaring was at a specific frequency that prevented the monster from moving.\n “Looks like someone broke into the pocket dimension! I smell the disgusting scent of Warlock blood…”\n The Green-skinned Barbarian leader’s nose twitched and he concluded confidently.\n “The Ouroboros Clan? Even they have to abide by our rules in the Forgotten Land!” Together with these two Magi was a human Magus with a strange brand on his face that seemed like some kind of symbol.\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-421","bookId":1513,"book":{"id":1513,"title":"Warlock of the Magus World","description":"What happens when a scientist from a futuristic world reincarnates in a World of Magic and Knights?\n An awesome MC — that’s what happens!\n A scientist’s goal is to explore the secrets of the universe, and this is exactly what Leylin sets out to do when he is reincarnated.
