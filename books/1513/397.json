{"id":58953,"no":397,"title":"Chapter 397","content":"Rank 4 Warlock Following Robin, he passed by various bizarre buildings with strange styles. There were all types out there, and before Leylin had the time to identify them, he was led by Robin into another building. After passing around a corner, there came across another Warlock in black gilded clothing. There were also rings of mysterious black patterns on his face. “Johnny!” Kubler, who had been following behind Leylin immediately clenched his fists, seemingly terrified as he hid in Leylin’s shadow. “Greetings to Marquis Robin!” Johnny came before Robin, and then greeted him using the etiquette of nobility. “It’s Count Johnny! Here, let me introduce to you Leylin here! He’s a rank 3 Warlock about to join our clan!” Robin smiled slightly. “So it’s Lord Leylin!” Johnny bowed, “Though it’s the first time we’re meeting, I have a request. I wonder if you could agree to it.” “If it’s about Kubler, I’m afraid I can’t agree.” Leylin immediately answered. “That’s a real shame,” Johnny answered indifferently, not looking the least bit exasperated, causing Leylin to shiver inwardly. “What if I say I’m the one asking?” At this moment, another voice interrupted. “Marquis Wood!” Besides Leylin and Robin, the other Warlocks immediately bowed. Leylin glanced at him. It was a blonde middle-aged man, brightness and resolution in his expression that also held an imposing aura. There was also the Giant Kemoyin Serpent bloodline on his body, and it even overshadowed Robin. “Kubler is a criminal who stole a precious treasure from me. I hope you can hand him over to me.” Wood’s eyes were fixed on Leylin, a pressure being emanated from him. Kubler was ashen, and after seeing Johnny’s look of satisfaction, he immediately understood that after seeing he had a new master, Johnny immediately asked someone else for help. “So are you handing him over?” In that moment, numerous thoughts flitted through Leylin’s mind. On the surface, Wood was truly a Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlock, as compared to Johnny with Black Horall Snake bloodline, his bloodline was more noble. In addition, he had entered the rank 3, and from the perspective of one looking at merely profits, it was better to give Kubler up. Exchanging a rank 1 Mankestre Warlock who had no hopes of advancing for a favourable impression from a rank 3 Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlock, there was little to consider in this trade. Johnny, who understood this, immediately looked smug, while Kubler looked defeated. “My apologies, but no.”Leylin’s voice sounded, allowing Kubler to recover from his despair. “Master!” Kubler let out a long breath, looking touched. “Hm?” Wood’s gaze that was sharp like a sword pierced towards Leylin, “Have you thought this through clearly?” “Of course! Very clearly!” Leylin did not hesitate and met his gaze. There was the talk of three ways of thought in his previous world, but Leylin’s principles had long since taken shape, and they were to prioritise benefits! The moment he had to make a choice, he would consider his own benefits and choose the best course of action. Such a line of thought was not purely about tangible benefits; it also took into consideration reputation, familial and romantic love, and other such things. Of course, all this varied from person to person. Some felt that love was priceless and decided to be biased towards it, while others believed it was worth 50,000 or 100,000 units. They would then make the corresponding choice. For instance, if time was spent on working or going out with family, Leylin believed that working for one day amounted to 100 units, but with the family, he would lose 300 yet gain 600 from the happiness in his heart. The total profit would be 200. When comparing things, it was indeed better to go out with the family. Using this logic, if his work earned him 1000 and the value of going out with his family were 300, it was an obvious decision to continue working. Now, handing Kubler over might give Wood a good impression of him and provide a good foundation for this period of time. However, in the long run, the gains do not compensate for the losses. ‘Kubler followed me and brought me to the Ouroboros Clan. In exchange, I will ensure his safety. All this complies with the principle of an equal exchange. If I abandon him now, not only will my reputation be damaged, I will also have abandoned my own values. “In addition, I’m definitely being watched over by many lords. If I appear to be too cold-blooded, they will definitely be disappointed. This will cause an eventual loss in the future, which is even worse than offending Wood.’ Though Magi were generally cold and rational, the leaders always had to advocate for hope, hot-bloodedness and sacrifice. If the lower ranks of the organisation did not strive to better themselves, and they weren’t hot-blooded enough to sacrifice themselves, what benefits would they gain in the end? The essence of any group was the unequal responsibilities of the higher and lower levels. Honestly speaking, Wood was merely a rank 3 Warlock. The moment Leylin entered, he would have a similar status. At most, there would be a slight difference in their strength. Would Wood actually dare do anything? If he withdrew right now, the onlookers would immediately be disappointed, and nobody would then rely on him. After comparing these, Leylin finally made the choice that would benefit him the most. “Good, very good! I hope you won’t regret this in the future!” Two streams of white air were expunged from Wood’s nostrils as he glared at Leylin. With a fling of his robes, he exited from the side, with Johnny following closely behind. “Don’t worry! The moment you enter our Ouroboros Clan, you’ll be given the position of a Marquis. Wood wouldn’t dare do anything to you out in the open.” Robin believed Leylin was worried about Wood taking revenge and immediately consoled him. “So if I don’t join, does that mean he’ll take revenge very quickly?” Leylin rolled his eyes, but he could tell that he was being invited to their organisation. He immediately answered, “Of course! Where else can I go to if not to the Ouroboros Clan?” “Haha…” Robin burst out in laughter and patted Leylin on the shoulder, “Exactly! In the entire central continent, the Ouroboros Clan is the best place for Giant Kemoyin Serpent Warlocks to join. You made the right choice!” “Alright, let’s not let the lord wait too long.” Leylin reminded him. If not for the fact that there were rank 4 Warlocks in Robin’s organisation, he would not have agreed so readily. “Oh, right! Yes, come with me!” Remembering there was work at hand, Robin immediately led the way. The two chatted as they walked, and after passing through a few obstructions, they finally arrived in front of a small villa. “My mentor, Gilbert, is a very amiable person. There isn’t any etiquette required, so just relax.” Robin smiled towards Leylin and then opened the door to the villa, bringing Leylin inside. The furniture on this level was all ordinary but placed very cleverly, giving a very warm atmosphere. Robin left the rest of the people outside and brought Leylin straight to a study room on the second level. “Mentor, I’ve brought Leylin here!” Robin spoke lightly to the wooden door, which then automatically opened with a creak. “Greetings to Duke Gilbert!” The moment Leylin went in, he did not first take in the surroundings or the appearance of Duke Gilbert. Instead, he saluted him. “Good child! Raise your head and let me look at you properly.” Upon hearing this, Leylin looked up, his eyes flitting across. This place was filled with bookshelves. The smell of black truffles emanated, and behind the red desk was a bald old man wearing a nightgown. He was clean-shaven, with layers of fine wrinkles on his body. “Is this the realm of a rank 4 Warlock, a Morning Star Magus?” Though Leylin’s senses were more powerful than the average rank 3 Warlock, he had not sensed this person in front of him. In his spiritual senses, there was nobody behind the desk, but what was in front of his eyes proved that he was truly there. The disparity of this left Leylin feeling giddy. A glint of wisdom flashed in Gilbert’s eyes. He scanned Leylin for an instant and then concluded, “You’re very young! You’re not even a hundred and have even advanced to be a rank 3 Warlock. Though there was support from the Giant Kemoyin Serpent bloodline, your talent and efforts are commendable.” “Hm… Are you willing to be my student?” Gilbert asked after staying silent for a moment. “Of course. Greetings to Mentor!” Leylin immediately bowed. Since he had already agreed to join their organisation, there was no disadvantage to having another person to rely on. In addition, this rank 4 Warlock was more than capable of guiding him. “Haha… good! Very good! I was already planning to give up on disciples, but I’ve been sent a genius…” Gilbert chuckled, the wrinkles on his face unfolding. “Congratulations Leylin! From hereon, you’re my junior!” Robin congratulated him. “En! This is your senior, Robin. There are a few others who aren’t here. I’ll introduce you to them in the future.” Gilbert was evidently elated. “Also, your title and territory will be given to you soon. Robin will bring you to take care of all these matters. You’re from another continent, yes? Robin! Bring him to my storeroom and show him Crystal 1 and let him have a better understanding of our Magi in the central continent. Gilbert saw through a great many things with a single glance, not allowing Leylin to refute anything. “Understood, mentor!” Robin and Leylin could only bow before leaving the room. “That’s… it?” Leylin was still in disbelief. Wasn’t this too simple? “To officially join us, there’s obviously more to do. However, since you’re mentor’s student, things will be different!” Robin said all this matter-of-factly. “In addition, you still have to take care of a few miscellaneous issues. Mentor means for you to take care of everything before you see him again. He will then consider what knowledge to pass on to you.” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-397","bookId":1513,"book":{"id":1513,"title":"Warlock of the Magus World","description":"What happens when a scientist from a futuristic world reincarnates in a World of Magic and Knights?
