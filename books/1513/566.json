{"id":59122,"no":566,"title":"Chapter 566","content":"Shadowing \n A Morning Star Magus would not dare face the wrath of a Radiant Moon.\n Outside the elegant palace, a few Morning Star Magi looked at each other and kept their distance, leaving the low-level servants hugging their heads and trembling at the side.\n A reckless energy wave swept across the area near the throne, and soon there was not a single living thing in the area.\n “Rage is the natural enemy of all Magi! Don’t tell me, you’re a bloodline Warlock as well?” A soothing gentle laugh sounded in the air like a clear spring, mocking at Zegna.\n Shockingly, upon hearing the voice, Zegna calmed a little. Besides slightly heavy breathing, he showed no significant difference from before the contact.\n “You are right! But soon or later I’m going to wipe out the bloodline of those damn Kemoyin Warlocks!”\n Zegna returned to his throne, and the moon on his forehead glowed with bright light, brightening up the entire palace.\n “In your current state, you might not be able to deal with Scarlet Eye even if you use a large amount of firasource stones to increase your soul force. Unless you can lure him out of the Lava World, or find a way to eliminate the resistance of the world’s will…” The woman said in a cold voice.\n “You’re still pestering me to use that?” Zegna replied in the same tone.\n “Yes! I am the most experienced in the tests of secondary clones. I can reduce the percentage of error such that it’s lower than one out of a million, and the best method for you to go to Lava World...”\n The female voice seemed to analyse the situation in a very composed manner, sounding very charming.\n “If you want to use rank 5 strength in the Lava World, this is the only way. Furthermore, you won’t be detected as an enemy by the foreign world through some cleansing of the mind of the clone.”\n Zegna fell into complete silence upon hearing the last sentence. A foreign world’s will was the biggest hindrance to any Magus, and once it worked to support that world’s inhabitant, even a Radiant Moon would not dare to defy its terrifying power.\n Perhaps, only those who were at the peak of the Breaking Dawn Realm would have the power to destroy the world’s will.\n Zegna’s face turned solemn and gloomy all of a sudden. “Pass down my order. All Magi of Jupiter’s Thunder are to return and assist in the preparation of a pathway to the Lava World. All proposals and backups are to be effective immediately. Let’s give Scarlet Eye’s Holy Solar Festival a big gift!”\n Zegna’s voice lowered gradually as his facial expression turned malevolent.\n In the Lava World, Leylin had not noticed any of this. He had reached the head’s place with Loke And Schiker.\n “You guys are really lucky. I was transferred to the central garrison. Since you lot were from the Special Task Force, I recommended all of you to enter the Martial Officer Department of the head.”\n Schiker was wearing the uniform of an Emberwing general as he brought the rest to the Martial Officer Department.\n “I am truly honoured and thankful for your recommendation!” Both Leylin and Loke showed gratitude towards Schiker.\n With them being allocated here, they would hold high positions wherever they went in the future. It was also obvious that they would have the benefit of getting closer to the head.\n As for Leylin and Loke, they both had unspeakable secrets, so the main reason why they got close to Schiker was to use him as a stepping stone towards the head. Since that dream of theirs had come true, they were both thrilled.\n “Good! So long as you know I mean well!” Schiker patted Leylin’s shoulder. He did not wish to spare a second glance at Loke, but he still gave Loke a smile as he recalled his father’s words.\n “It’s different here, completely unlike being in the Special Task Force. You have to be extra careful. Once you violate law and order, I won’t be able to help you... ”\n While Schiker was giving them reminders, he walked them into a small office, “This is Bowens, and he’ll be in charge of you in the future.”\n A blond-haired middle-aged man in the office got off from his seat and came up to welcome them when he saw Schiker. He seemed to be rather easy going, “Haha, Schiker! You haven’t been here in quite some time. So these are the ones? Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of them.”\n But Leylin and Loke dared not ignore him. Not only would Bowens be their superior in future, his aura was somewhat similar to the Duke they had encountered previously.\n This new superior of Leylin’s was also an impressive elite, a Morning Star Magus that had already reached level 10 of Fireplume.\n ‘This familiar aura! He was one of the elite Morning Star Magi I sensed earlier!’\n The red progress bar was currently already halfway full. The A.I. Chip had already begun to smoothly merge the essence of the tenth level of Fireplume into his Morning Star point mass, which would greatly increase his power.\n ‘I’m not sure how the modified tenth level of Fireplume will be… How will it compare to these true Emberwing elites? I can’t wait to find out…’ Leylin curled his lips in a subtle movement, showing great interest.\n Bowens was totally oblivious to the decision of his new subordinate, who was planning on getting rid of him after completing the new Fireplume. He instead found this Ley quite genial and amiable, instantly growing fond of him.\n “There are specific duty rooms and bedrooms in the Martial Officer Department, you guys cannot stay in the Special Task Force anymore, you have to move in from now on. You do have any missions yet, I want you two to join the night patrol team and attend trainings during the daytime for now, any questions? ”\n After Schiker had left, Bowens turned and looked at them, his tone was less courteous, his aura full of dignity.\n “Yes, Sir!” Leylin and Loke bowed together.\n Night arrived.\n “Something is just not right…” Leylin straightened up his body, feeling good that everyone had their individual bedrooms despite the limited area.\n “Schiker has always treated us as his trusted aides… Now that he’s going to the central garrison, why didn’t he bring us with him?”\n Leylin rugged his chin, “Even though being in the Martial Officer Department means to have a very promising future, it is also considered as being his father’s bodyguards. It’s unlikely that he put both of us in here, unless… someone got exposed...”\n Leylin had full confidence in himself, but Loke could not even fool him much less a rank 5 elite.\n “Now it seems that they’re not as cautious about me anymore, even sending me the tenth level of Fireplume. However, I’m obviously here under observation. It seems like they don’t trust me unconditionally yet…”\n “As for Loke, he’s basically bait. They’re ready to net the entire organisation behind him…”\n Leylin grew more assured of his assumptions as he thought it through. Suddenly, a red light glowed from the ring on his finger.\n Leylin was shocked for a second, but then he lifted a map written on pale yellow parchment from the top of the table.\n A little black dot was moving slowly on the map.\n “I knew you couldn’t wait, but I never expected you to be this impatient.” Leylin smiled and laid down.\n A thin black string drifted swiftly out of his body and emerged from the darkness.\n Hidden in the shadows, Leylin made use of his fine manipulation and the perception of the A.I. Chip, carefully avoiding numerous sentry devices and traps in the leader’s area as he followed the other party.\n That person was holding onto a black pearl, which had helped him get through many detection formations and the like. It seemed to be recording something.\n ‘Collecting information, eh? It seems like Jupiter’s Lightning wants to get rid of the leader of Atlan too…’\n Leylin smiled, discovering the other figure who had also secretly followed after Loke. He shook his head and hid himself further.\n He was here in his real body, while inside the room was a mere shadow puppet. Still, with the A.I. Chip’s abilities, it was not a problem for the puppet to cover his absence for a short period of time.\n ‘This fellow didn’t even realise he was being followed. He only has himself to blame…’\n Since Leylin already knew that this was a setup, he wanted to return to his bedroom, and hence he hid in silence.\n Just when he was about to leave, a horrifying ferocious energy wave fluctuation in the air caused his body to come to a violent stop.\n ‘What’s this fluctuation?’\n He raised his head, gazing at the sky nearby, ‘Morning Star Arcane Art? No, not that! It’s more like another path to power. It seems like magic, but it’s actually a combination of fire elemental spell formations, not an Arcane Art.’\n Together with strong fluctuations, a point of scarlet fire lit up the sky. The heavens rumbled as if they contained muffled thunder.\n A rain of lava dripped down, spreading over a vast range and almost covering up the entirety of the head’s residence.\n ‘He dares to attack this place directly?’ Leylin felt at a loss for words, unsure as to how he should praise that person’s bravery.\n The ghastly lava rain had wrapped up the entire place, every single drop containing a power of over a thousand degrees. If they were allowed to hit the ground, all the officers except the head and a few elite Star ranks would die, and the whole place would be razed to the ground. The leader would turn into a huge laughingstock.\n “Stop!” “How dare you!!”\n A few ferocious and reckless voices sounded around the whole place, and dazzling energy light pillars shot up forming into a light shield that covered the whole place within.\n “Kekeke! How many can you save?” A quirky voice sounded in the midst of sky, followed by a huge amount of lava rain, it extended fiercely, covering the entire city of Tylasus.\n A drop of the lava rain could kill all the normal citizens easily. Were this to happen before the Holy Solar Festival, the head of the union would land in deep trouble.\n Thus, Leylin judged that that person would surely take action.\n “Screeee!”\n Just then, a ferocious bird, huge scarlet body complemented with a stunning tail that was covered by flames flew out of the residence, the high-pitched whistle of a phoenix sounding out…\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-566","bookId":1513,"book":{"id":1513,"title":"Warlock of the Magus World","description":"What happens when a scientist from a futuristic world reincarnates in a World of Magic and Knights?\n An awesome MC — that’s what happens!\n A scientist’s goal is to explore the secrets of the universe, and this is exactly what Leylin sets out to do when he is reincarnated.
