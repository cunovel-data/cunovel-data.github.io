{"id":59106,"no":550,"title":"Chapter 550","content":"Testing and Passing\\n\\n Compared to the Magi of the Magus World who liked to work behind the scenes, the strong in the Lava World were more willing to take the stage and take control of the organisations.\\n\\n The kingships of large-scaled kingdoms were taken up by Star ranks. In that case, it was understandable for there to be a large number of Exemplaries in the higher ups of the Atlan Union’s army.\\n\\n Furthermore, the army was the quickest place to advance in status, especially during wartime. As long as one was capable, had outstanding results, and nobody obstructed them, people were usually promoted rapidly. This was a method that was much better than others, and also the way that Leylin liked the best.\\n\\n “But… There’s so much hardship in being a soldier. I don’t want to be trampled on…” Leylin’s eyes swivelled around as he had an idea.\\n\\n Days later, in a special building within the city.\\n\\n “Are you here to apply for the Special Task Force? Come with me!” A female Emberwing race member said. She was dressed in a military uniform and was expressionless, yet looked to be formidable. She carried a stack of documents and forms and turned to leave, leaving Leylin and the rest with a view of her elegant back.\\n\\n “This doll is really…” A burly man beside Leylin began to complain.\\n\\n “How callous. I like it…” Another pale young man’s eyes glowed green, leaving Leylin speechless.\\n\\n Those with Leylin were all of the Emberwing race. However, what made them distinct from the rest of their clansmen, was the obvious energy undulations from their bodies.\\n\\n Since this world had Exemplaries, it was obvious that they had special treatment and missions. Things like the Special Task Force were formed for this reason.\\n\\n With enough strength, Emberwing clansmen were allowed to be selected into the Special Task Force. Not only would their positions be high, they had the best treatment in the army.\\n\\n Leylin wanted to sneak in, and he obviously formed a fake identity and signed up successfully.\\n\\n What Leylin cared about was that the Special Task Force often needed to deal with riots that had to do with Exemplaries. As long as he was there, he would definitely bump into the Triserpent Sect.\\n\\n For this reason, he was in no hurry at all. He would swing in and sneak into the Special Task Force and hide away there while gathering more information.\\n\\n After all, he was not quite sure about the background of the Triserpent Sect, and he needed to remain cautious.\\n\\n If this was a trap and he still charged right in, wouldn’t he be seeking death?\\n\\n Leylin and the young male Emberwing looked just as nervous and excited as the rest while they followed the female soldier to a large square.\\n\\n A middle-aged soldier in silver armour was already waiting there, his expression grim.\\n\\n “We’re beginning the test now! Who’s first?” The middle-aged instructor’s voice was so loud that everyone’s eardrums seemed to have gone numb.\\n\\n “Me!” That pale young man seemed to be too anxious to show off and darted to the front.\\n\\n “Fine. Use all your strength and attack the black obelisk ahead!” The military instructor stepped aside and revealed a giant black crystal before everyone.\\n\\n “Hah!” The young man took a deep breath, and a layer of fire-red light was emitted from his body. Streams of air were dispelled as dust filled the air.\\n\\n *Rumble!* He threw a punch, and it landed on the black crystal. While it did not budge the slightest, a dim layer of red light appeared on the surface.\\n\\n Red light filled the obelisk with some difficulty, and fine rings appeared on the surface.\\n\\n A total of five red rings appeared, before completely disappearing. Upon seeing this, a look of satisfaction flashed by the young man’s expression.\\n\\n “Mm! Fifth level of FIreplume Technique. Exemplary status. Pass!” The officer nodded, with no surprise in his expression.\\n\\n “Next!” His voice was icy-cold, causing the young man’s original complacency to disappear.\\n\\n “Me!” The one who went up was plump, and similarly used Fireplume Technique. However, only three ringed runes appeared on the obelisk.\\n\\n “Third level of Fireplume Technique. Fail!”\\n\\n The officer’s voice was callous, and two soldiers immediately went forward and dragged him out.\\n\\n “Ah… Wait! Give me another chance, I can definitely…” From a distance, the sounds of his wails and pleas could be heard, causing great fear amongst the crowd in the square.\\n\\n “Next!” The officer’s expression remained cold as he continued.\\n\\n One young man after another went up, and most passed the test, though there were a few who failed. The officer was ruthless as he commanded the soldiers to chase them out.\\n\\n Leylin watched this scene coolly from below.\\n\\n Fireplume Technique! He had heard of it before, and knew that it was used by the Emberwing race. It could be said to be found everywhere, and practically everyone knew it.\\n\\n There was nothing special about levels one to three of Fireplume Technique, and was similar to the breathing techniques of the Magus World. It could increase one’s vitality and endurance slightly, with some tolerance towards fire elements.\\n\\n Once one got to the fourth level of Fireplume Technique, it would be similar to a meditation technique and allow the Emberwing clansmen to have a rapid increase in strength.\\n\\n The fourth and fifth level was the strength of an Exemplary rank, while six and seven meant Earth rank. Eight and nine were considerably powerful existences and were comparable to the Sky rank. Once one advanced to the tenth level, of which there had been no precedent in history, that was the door to the Star realm!\\n\\n Though the fundamental parts of Fireplume Technique could be found everywhere, the fourth and fifth levels were kept somewhat secret, and were considered the essence of the race. As for the next few levels, they were kept secure, and could only be passed on in a few places. The reason why so many young people wanted to enter the Special Task Force was probably because they wanted information on the later levels of the technique.\\n\\n As for the tenth level, that was something only the family of the head of Atlan Union possessed. Most had never even heard of it.\\n\\n A grave, burly, middle-aged Emberwing clansman went forward. Extending a scarlet palm, six fire rings immediately appeared on the obelisk, and even the officer couldn’t help but give the man a second look, “Sixth level of Fireplume Technique. Earth rank. Pass!”\\n\\n “How amazing! It’s someone at level 6, the Earth rank!”\\n\\n “These sorts of people can survive anywhere. What is he doing here?”\\n\\n “It must be for the information regarding the eighth and ninth level of the technique! It’s only passed on in the army…” The appearance of what was the best results till now immediately gave rise to loud discussions in the queue.\\n\\n The man from before stood expressionlessly aside in answer to the looks of curiosity or reverence, and the officer couldn’t help but have an expression of approval.\\n\\n “Next!” The officer yelled again, eyes scanning through the crowd that was beginning to thin.\\n\\n ‘I’m afraid that this burly man is the one with the best results in this batch. It’s not a bad harvest! At least one is passable!’ The officer was stuck in this train of thought, but then he saw another slender clansman stand up.\\n\\n “Hm?” Though this above average looking man seemed frail, the officer’s eyes brightened as he lapsed into thought.\\n\\n ‘This little guy doesn’t seem to be simple!’\\n\\n Leylin obviously cared little about what the officer thought. In actuality, he was now performing research and gathering information on the path of Fireplume Technique.\\n\\n ‘Interesting. Interesting! At the beginning, it’s Knight training, and after that, there seems to be content infused with some conscient runes…’\\n\\n He was interested in such techniques.\\n\\n “But I need to get through this!” Leylin shook his head at the ruckus in the crowd due to his being in a daze for too long.\\n\\n A Morning Star Magus’ point mass was a minute dot that could contain the terrifying strength of a Morning Star without leaking any energy. With the A.I. Chip’s help, there was no issue with simulating the energy belonging to Fireplume technique.\\n\\n ‘It’s a pity… The strongest person here is only the officer, who is at the Sky rank with the eighth level of Fireplume Technique. The next few levels, as well as that of the Star rank, can’t be obtained as of yet!’\\n\\n Leylin slowly extended his palm. Yet, it seemed like a layer of melting flame came to life, spreading across its surface. This immediately silenced the crowd.\\n\\n “Hah!” Leylin controlled his strength, looking as if he was attacking with all he had.\\n\\n *Rumble!* The entire obelisk began to tremble as bright fiery runes appeared one after another.\\n\\n One, two, three… The light from bright flames were dazzling, and spread till there were seven on the obelisk. There even seemed to be half a ring extra.\\n\\n The officer’s eyes shone and he immediately asked, “Seventh level of Fireplume Technique. Peak Earth rank! Very good. What’s your name?”\\n\\n “My name is ‘Ley’, my lord!” Leylin performed a military salute, something the officer immediately found pleasing.\\n\\n At this moment, the silent crowd suddenly became boisterous, hearts filled with jealousy that could not be suppressed while observing Leylin’s handsome face.\\n\\n As long as this young man did not die in battle, he would become the rising star of the Special Task Force, or even the entire union!\\n\\n “Hm?” At this moment, Leylin acutely felt a gaze land on his back.\\n\\n “It’s the large man from before at the sixth level. This feeling of jealousy and hostility? Though it’s normal, why is there killing intent?”\\n\\n The corner of Leylin’s lips rose in a cold smile. An enemy of this level was too boring.\\n\\n When all those who had failed cleared out, the officer stood before Leylin and the rest, voice booming.\\n\\n “Welcome to the Special Task Force! I am your officer, Schiker. You’ll soon find that the Special Task Force is the best place to be. As long as you complete your missions, we can give you techniques, money, status or land…”\\n\\n It had to be said that the officer was silver-tongued. In a short amount of time, he had incited the hot-bloodedness of the youths.\\n\\n Leylin’s expression was also one of excitement, though he found this all ridiculous on the inside.\\n\\n “Now, follow me to participate in your first mission!”\\n\\n Powerful undulations were emitted from Schiker’s body. Only then did the members realise that their officer was actually at the Sky rank!\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-550","bookId":1513,"book":{"id":1513,"title":"Warlock of the Magus World","description":"What happens when a scientist from a futuristic world reincarnates in a World of Magic and Knights?\\n An awesome MC — that’s what happens!\\n A scientist’s goal is to explore the secrets of the universe, and this is exactly what Leylin sets out to do when he is reincarnated.
