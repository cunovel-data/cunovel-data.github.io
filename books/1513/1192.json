The world rumbled as a few powerful gods escaped the place, cutting a sorry figure as they assembled before Silvanus.\\n\\n “Chaos Lord… Deserving of the name…” Tyr looked at a laceration on his chest, filled with chaos energy as it spread throughout his body.\\n\\n The other gods weren’t much better, Gruumsh the most worse off. More than half his body had been corroded, revealing dark brown skin. Golden blood and internal organs were sticking out of his body.\\n\\n It wasn’t an easy task to kill two peak rank 8 Magi, and even these five formidable gods had to pay the price.\\n\\n “I’ve consumed a lot of divine force. I’ll need to enter slumber for a while, and looking at the state of my worshippers it will take longer than normal…” Oghma frowned.\\n\\n “You’ve worked hard…” A layer of green light enveloped the greater gods’ bodies. Their divine force was suddenly replenished, their expressions recovering as the injuries on their bodies healed.\\n\\n “I’ve gathered enough faith over the millennia to replenish your powers…” Silvanus was brimming with gentle kindness. He’d always been nice to everyone he met, the sole exception being the Magi.\\n\\n “Those Magi can watch on as two of their own fall. They really are sinister and crafty…” The other gods said in indignation, trying to come up with some sort of conspiracy.\\n\\n Silvanus waved, and the elemental power of the four planes instantly isolated their location. Even Mother Core couldn’t peer in on further conversation.\\n\\n Mother Core spoke up without hurry after the image was cut off, “I cannot sense the two in the spacetime river… They’ve fallen completely, their truesouls destroyed. Without the intervention of a rank 9 it will be impossible for them to revive…”\\n\\n Magi gained the ability to revive from a single drop of blood at rank 6, and Magi of laws were like cockroaches that would revive swiftly as long as a trace of their will remained. However, greater gods were at the same level of power. Leylin could stop the gods from resurrecting, and so, too, could the gods stop Magi.\\n\\n No small number of Magi of laws had fallen in the Final War. Thinking of that point, even Leylin felt his heart go cold.\\n\\n ‘The ability to stop a Magus’ truesoul from entering the river of spacetime… Even Kelemvor should be unable to perform such feats,’ Leylin’s face grew imposing, ‘There’s only one possibility. Jergal has appeared once more! Is the Final War already at that stage?’\\n\\n Jergal was an ancient God of Death, the oldest god alive. Legends spoke of his weariness of his job that led him to create Kelemvor to assume his position, letting him enter seclusion somewhere in the Ghost World.\\n\\n Even the ancient dusk of the gods hadn’t aroused Jergal. Any existences harbouring ill will towards him could only die miserably, and as time passed his name had become a taboo secret. However, this renowned god had exited seclusion right now, participating in the Final War at such an early stage. The turn of events surprised Leylin.\\n\\n It wasn’t hard for numerous greater gods to kill two peak rank 8 Magi. However, it was far more difficult to wipe their souls from the spacetime river, something only the ancient God of Death was proficient in. Leylin felt like the coming battle would be intense, determining victory or death.\\n\\n However, these were all results he had to achieve. All obstructions on his path to truth and eternity would be crushed without hesitation, regardless of identity or power. A dull glow shone out of Leylin’s eyes…\\n\\n Starting with the fight in the Abyss, the gods completed adjusting their divine kingdoms quickly, beginning their counterattack against the Magi. All gods, regardless of rank and power, turned out in full strength to purge the Magi from their world.\\n\\n Although Magi of laws were stronger on average, the gods had the home field advantage. They didn’t hold back on their divine force at all, using everything in their arsenals to take the Magi out.\\n\\n With the foundation of their divine kingdoms, they were not required to worry about the problem of their backyard catching fire. With numerous peak rank 8s stuck working on the two-world project, the gods were pressing forward step by step, eliminating several Magi in succession.\\n\\n The flames of war spread across the astral plane, extinguishing millions of lives.\\n\\n Information from ancient times was spread despite the unreasonable ancient races, speaking of the Magi, the dusk of the gods, and the road to eternity. It deeply stunned the entire world.\\n\\n The actions of the gods were quick and violent, like predators stalking their prey as they aimed at the weakest points to launch fatal strikes. With several powerful gods overseeing them, the gods took control of the prime material plane once more.\\n\\n Numerous priests were dispatched to aid the remaining survivors, bringing food and superior weapons. The World WIll adapted the prime material plane to a life without the sun, making new edible plants that were similar to oats and rice. Alongside the mushrooms and seeds brought up from the Underdark, the humans were finally satisfied.\\n\\n Hive after hive of the Lightkiller Bugs was destroyed, ceasing their suppression of humanity. Survivors started to build tall walled cities once more, establishing new towns as well as civilisation was rebuilt. Everything seemed to be heading for a better future…\\n\\n Sadly, in the eyes of certain existences like the Magi, these actions were pitiful death throes. Numerous peak rank 8 Magi had assembled outside the World of Gods, within the boundless astral plane. Leylin was standing at their core.\\n\\n “The major preparations are finally complete. The rest will be in your hands, Lord Leylin…” The truesoul of the Darkness Lord was a lump of black smoke with fiery red flames for eyes, flickering with the cycle of life as it moved.\\n\\n “That’s not a problem!” Leylin looked behind him.\\n\\n The silhouette of an extremely massive world was sitting there, a short distance away. It possessed the glory of the Magi, releasing energy waves that Leylin was familiar with. The Magi had actually brought the Magus World here from across the astral plane!\\n\\n A massive world had been moved into the path of another equally large one. This had never happened in the history of the astral plane. This was the arduous project that the majority of peak rank 8 Magi had dedicated themselves to, combining their truesouls for a long time to complete.\\n\\n *Bzzt!* A unique attractive forces was generated as the two worlds drew close. Numerous laws distorted as they fused, spreading endlessly to form a network that encompassed the whole area.\\n\\n ‘The mutual attraction of the World Origin Forces…’ Leylin sighed in admiration, ‘When the World of Gods and Magus World fuse completely, the hidden path of eternity will show itself… A prophecy from ancient times verified by several Magi…’\\n\\n “Right… Now is the time for everything to end!” A faint light shone within Mother Core’s eyes as she arrived beside Leylin, looking at the disc in his hands.\\n\\n The combined efforts of many Magi had finally repaired the Manderhawke Plate, revealing several strange and disorderly patterns that formed one harmonious entity with a mysterious glow.\\n\\n “It’s started!” The Manderhawke Plate in Leylin’s hands floated up, emitting a warm radiance at the boundary of the World of Gods and the Magus World.\\n\\n “The End! Eternity!” Numerous peak rank 8 Magi roared, the power of laws gathering to the extreme to form turbulent rivers that represented their paths. All of it poured into the Manderhawke Plate.\\n\\n With the support of such great amounts of energy, the Manderhawke Plate grew larger and larger. White light melted a huge portion of the crystal sphere, revealing the World of Gods within.\\n\\n This wasn’t like the small-scaled attack Leylin used to enter before. It was a direct, violent confrontation, aimed to destroy the crystal sphere entirely! A terrifying sound spread across several worlds, causing the gods of the World of Gods to lose their heads in fear.\\n\\n “The crystal sphere! It’s been shattered!” They felt an impending sense of doom. It was impossible to measure the amount of damage they would take when the crystal sphere collapsed.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/warlock-of-the-magus-world/wmw-chapter-1192","bookId":1513,"book":{"id":1513,"title":"Warlock of the Magus World","description":"What happens when a scientist from a futuristic world reincarnates in a World of Magic and Knights?\\n An awesome MC — that’s what happens!\\n A scientist’s goal is to explore the secrets of the universe, and this is exactly what Leylin sets out to do when he is reincarnated.
