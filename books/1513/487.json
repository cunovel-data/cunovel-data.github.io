{"id":59043,"no":487,"title":"Chapter 487","content":"The Pursuit and The Appearance Leylin was extremely offended by the attempt on his life. Furthermore, Leo was the chief of the Oakheart Clan. If he was killed here, it would be a huge blow to the Azure Mountain King. The chase with Leo previously had not been merely for his entertainment. It was for the A.I. Chip to gather vital data and create a plan. Right now, with the data compiled, the A.I. Chip had come up with a large number of plans. It filtered through them continuously, leaving only the most feasible ones. [Model establishment completed, simulated combat victory rate: 67.9%!] it reported. “Enter supplementary mode!” Leylin’s voice was laced with a lethal aura. [Target number 1 is condensing energy particles. Determined to be the rank 3 spell Aurora Beam! Dodge to the right by 3.7m immediately!] the A.I. Chip warned. As per the simulation and the A.I. Chip’s deductions, target 1, Leo, activated a necklace of colourful gems in his hands. A powerful aurora burst forth, immediately attempting to swallow the entire area up along with Leylin. Leylin dodged to the side in a flash at the same moment the enemy made his move. “Aurora Beam!” Leo triggered the high-grade magic artifact in his hand. Immediately, a powerful multicoloured torrent drowned out the stone that Leylin was standing on, causing the terrain to cave. [Target defined as Number 3 is undergoing transformation. Estimated to be a descendant of the Banu Tribe. Bloodline activated, morphing into a Barbarian Bear!] “Aaaooo…” The moment the A.I. Chip ended the report, one of the men standing by Leo’s side let out a thunderous roar and started ripping his clothes apart. He morphed into a brutal bear with stiff white fur. Countless shards of sparkling ice circled around its body, emitting a freezing chill that formed billows of white fog around it. “Kill!” Leylin’s eyes gleamed blue. He danced gracefully, and lightheartedly managed to dodge from under the huge bear’s palm, sliding up in front of it instead. The Meteor Sword traced a beautiful arc as it flitted across the bear’s body. The white fur was slashed apart, revealing bright red flesh and an outline of the internal organs. Blood splattered all around. Unable to believe its defeat, the enormous creature howled loudly at first, but soon its voice tapered away until it fell silent. The earth rumbled as the carcass of the white bear resembling a large mountain collapsed onto the ground, causing large amounts of dust to fly. The fur of the bear started to shrink back into its pores, and soon returned to its original form of a Magus. “Number 4!” Number 1 and number 2 cried out in alarm, their eyes fixed on their dead comrade. They clearly knew the abilities of number 4, and the fact that after his transformation, he would be able to resist a rank 3 spell easily. And yet, he’d died this quickly! Number 1’s eyes darted towards the Meteor Sword in Leylin’s hand. His eyes narrowed and his pupils dilated, “Be wary of his sword! There’s something strange about it!” The Meteor Sword was originally a high-grade magic artifact, but through multiple improvements and optimisations, its quality had improved to that of a piece of magic equipment. Additionally, with the supplementary power of Toxic Bile, the current Meteor Sword could be considered a big threat to any Crystal Phase Magus! Leylin enjoyed handling foes like the bear, all brawn and no brain. “Hocada Beast!” On the other side, witnessing Leylin’s explosive retaliation, Leo’s face hardened and he yelled for his trump card. Howls rang out as a creature manifested out of thin air that had the upper body of a wolf and the lower half of an octopus. It landed right in front of Leylin. The countless suction pads on its arms looked like magnificent blooming flowers. “It’s no use!” Leylin muttered in a low voice, his silhouette dodging in a flash, avoiding the multiple arms’ attack. He stopped in front of the Hocada Beast. “Multilimb Strength!” The silhouette of a Multi-Armed Race member appeared behind Leylin, formidable power seeping into his body. [Ding! Multilimb Strength in operation. Host’s power is increasing!] The A.I. Chip reported. Leylin grasped his sword firmly, and hacked at the creature’s brain. The beast started cracking apart as fissures arose on its body as if it was breaking glass. They spread all over its body, before pieces of flesh began to simply fall apart. By the end, the creature’s body had been sliced into ruin, eventually crumbling apart like dirt. “Damn, ho… how are you so strong?” After executing the Hocada Beast, Leylin turned to look at Leo, the killing intent in his eyes causing the Oakheart Clan chief to feel a chill down his spine. “You’re next!” Leo could faintly make out what Leylin mouthed, and could see the mockery in the eyes that were staring into his. Having never experienced these circumstances before, it was a huge blow to his self-esteem. “Number 1, number 2, follow me!” Leo roared ferociously. “Stormwall!” A pale green whirlwind emerged from the short black staff in his hand. The huge whirlwind then formed a terrifying barricade that seemed to be made of sharp blades as it rushed towards Leylin. Number 1 and 2 nodded their heads, and simultaneously cast their own spells. “Water Elemental Rite!” A huge blue ball of water appeared on the ground under number one’s chant. “Arctic Draft!” Number 2 summoned a huge bout of chilly air and had it adhere to the ball of water. The icy wind sucked away the heat from the ball of water, causing a huge reaction as a frightening ball of ice was formed. “Combination spell—Iceberg Torrent!” The huge ball of ice was like a meteorite as it darted towards Leylin, smashing onto the ground. “Impressive!” The blue light in Leylin’s eyes dimmed. His body was covered in frost, and yet the Meteor Sword did not deviate even slightly from its trajectory, forging ahead and crashing into it to open up a pathway. The cold could freeze the average rank 3 Magus to death. To Leylin, though, all it could do was slow him down. “Shadowflame Plague!” A huge amount of dense black flames clashed with the whirlwind that had now developed into a hurricane. The two clashed, each trying to destroy the other. “Compared to combination spells, it’s wiser to rely on magic equipment. That way there won’t be anything to worry about!” Leylin tore through the hurricane and stepped in front of Leo, his eyes glistened with a piercing chill that gave the other man goosebumps. “Fatality’s Tip!” Black rays of death streaked across the vast sky, reaching Leo in a flash. Just as they were about to strike, a black wooden cross on his neck immediately flashed and formed a rune that represented new life and regeneration. The barrier shattered as the rays of death dissipated. A majority of the attack had been blocked by the defensive runes, but even then it had only diverted the attack as a thumb-sized hole appeared on Leo’s body, bleeding profusely. “How…. How can this be?” Leo glared at Leylin, the fear in his eyes palpable. He let out an odd cry, turned his head and fled. Number 1 and number 2 fulfilled their duties as bodyguards faithfully, blocking Leylin from giving chase. “Giving up after encountering such trivial problems, you certainly deserve to be called a descendant of a big family!” Leylin shook his head and laughed as his gaze on Leo was filled with mockery. Seeing the blood-covered Leylin, number 1 and 2 both felt a chill down their spines. In their time accompanying Leo, they had seen their fair share of slaughter. Yet, this was the first time they’d met someone as valiant and ferocious as Leylin. Both of them had cursed Leo umpteen times for provoking Leylin, but Leylin had what they needed, so they had no choice but to take action. “Get out of the way, or else you will die!” Leylin drew his sword and pointed at them. Number 1 and number 2 exchanged glances. Determination in their eyes, they both shook their heads. “Pity!” Leylin had no sympathy for the suicide fighters of large families. Moreover, these two from the Oakheart Clan had no means of defence remaining. Armed with the determination to die in battle, they stood in front of Leylin and blocked his path. …… “Damn it! Why? WHY?” Leo was fleeing madly, his heart in absolute turmoil. Not only had he brought along a rank 4 spell scroll for this, he’d even brought with him a large number of potions and magic equipment. He’d even had four Crystal Phase Magi accompanying him! With such power, to deal with a newly promoted Crystal Phase Magus ought to have been a simple matter. And yet, the opponent was unfathomably terrifying, practically wiping out his entire team *Krrich!* Suddenly, the sound of two crystals cracking was emitted from his chest. After hearing the sound, the blood drained from his face and he panicked. He sped up as he dashed along. “Number 1 and Number 2 are also dead? Useless indeed!” Soon after, he ground his teeth and retrieved a communication device. He punched some secret code on it and the message was sent from his hand. “I still have a chance! I am the chief of the Oakheart Clan, so long as I make it back, grandfather will absolutely not turn a blind eye to…” Leo cut a sorry figure as he fled in disarray, speaking words of encouragement to himself. “Got you!” a voice was suddenly transmitted from behind him. He turned his head, only to see Leylin rushing towards him at the speed of lightning, a brilliant black streak. At this rate, he would catch up in about a mere ten seconds. The new blood on Leylin’s body was obviously from number 1 and 2. “No! You cannot kill me! I am the chief of the Oakheart Clan! If you let me go, I can give you whatever you want…..” Leo ran madly, his voice turning hoarse as he yelled out terms of surrender. “I only want your life!” Leylin knew promises made under such circumstances were not reliable. Hence, without emotion, his killing intent increased. He speed increased threefold, and he was but an arm’s length from Leo and his petrified face. “Die!” Leylin drew his black Meteor Sword. “Stop!” An extremely imposing voice spoke directly into Leylin’s mind.
