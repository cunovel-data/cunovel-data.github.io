A Magus who was dressed like a wandering poet was playing a pipe organ. A group of residents was watching and cheering him on. “Yes! Over here, official Magi often mingle amongst the commoners and the residents know them very well too…” Kubler explained to Leylin. “In the central continent, the Magi and nobility communicate in the Byron language. Hence, my Lord, you do not need to worry about a language barrier. In fact, here are some materials about the central continent and a few variants of maps as well as information about communication. “ Kubler respectfully handed over a crystal ball filled with information to Leylin. For a Magus to learn the Byron language was compulsory. Thus, Leylin and Kubler could communicate the moment they met. They could understand each other immediately. Leylin helped himself to a scoop of dessert. A rich, fragrant, and sweet flavour excited his taste buds, “Nice delicate food, looks like the lifestyles of the commoners in the central continent are better than in Twilight Zone…..” “Naturally. This is the central continent, the core of the Magus world!” Kubler exclaimed with a hint of pride. Leylin smiled and shook his head. Even if the seven layers of the subterranean world did not agree with such a statement, during the ancient past of the central continent, there was at least a rank 7 Magus overseeing it. But now? Only a slight hint of their past glory had been restored. As for this problem, Leylin did not want to do anything about it. After all, the current situation in the central continent might suit him better. After a night of good rest, Leylin and Kubler headed towards a location outside of the city. The busy road there was filled with horse carriages and other means of transportation. Loads of luggage and goods were being transported on them and the place looked prosperous. In addition, every passerby on the street had some level of energy undulations on them. There were very few commoners present. Leylin and Kubler crossed the wide and sturdy road and saw what looked like a futuristic airport. There were many white oval-shaped airships at the huge flat field, some taking off and others landing. A throng of people moved in and out of them like an army of ants. Some of the airships were towing truckloads of goods, with workers calling out to their partners to off-load the cargo and luggage. The scene was hot, busy, and messy. The central continent was huge, its lands vast and boundless. Ground transport was not only slow, but it was also much more dangerous. Hence, airships had become their common mode of transportation. Even within the small section of a city, there was an airship docking point with a few Magi and acolytes on duty manning it. Their responsibilities included maintaining law and order in the city and the maintenance and repair of airships. On top of that, there was a pool of specially trained engineers for the job. With bodies as thin as a match, bulging eyes and balding heads, Leylin saw them working between the bases of the airships and the tunnels with spanners and other tools in their hands. Construction cost and maintenance fees for such airships were very high. Still, as long as the air route was secure, there were profits to be made. It was a case of large investments yielding great profits. And such investments could only be made by Magi who possessed great wealth. The airships of the south coast were smaller than the ones here. Their air routes were limited and their flying times were regulated. They simply could not be compared to those from the central continent. “Who is behind these various air routes?” Leylin asked Kubler in a soft tone. A single airship ticket in an ordinary cabin cost one hundred magic crystals. For Leylin and Kubler, who naturally chose to travel in the superior cabin, their journey alone had cost them six hundred magic crystals. Fortunately, Leylin was rich and imposing as he had control of an entire region’s resources. Money came easily at his beck and call. He had an abundance of magic crystals, so he would naturally not be a scrooge. Even though Leylin had the great support of Twilight Zone’s resources, when he compared himself to the enormous airship business, he felt that he was still lacking. “The central continent’s entire airship route is single-handedly managed by the Fallor Family, it is their private property!” “Private property?” Leylin was shocked, and immediately asked, ” Who is the Magus on their side?” Such enormous benefits that included crucial traffic involvements, if their background was not up to par, they wouldn’t have been able to manage such a thing. And for the Fallor Family to dominate the entire continent until now, surely their support was a formidable one. “The Fallor Family themselves have two Morning Star Magi. Of course, it doesn’t count for much. The crucial one who has their back is the Monarch of the Skies!” “Monarch of the Skies? Breaking Dawn Magus?” Leylin nodded his head. With a Magus who stood at the pinnacle of the central continent devouring those deals, the Fallor Family were basically relegated to housekeepers. The actual one who had the control over the entire airship’s business was the Monarch of the Skies after all. “Yes, under the rule of the prestigious and intimidating Monarch of the Skies, the safety of the airships is guaranteed,” Kubler remarked, a ray of yearning in his eyes. Rank 6 Magus! This was the highest level in the central continent! Every single action of his would affect the lives of innumerable Magi underneath!…… …… *Woosh* With the whirring of the wind, the airship retracted its anchors, and it started to drifting upwards into the sky. Leylin stood on the deck enjoying the wind, a pleased look in his eyes and a smile on his face. With a mix of sunshine and the taste of fresh green grass, the cool wind blew and lingered around him. “It’s been too long! Too long! I have not been under the sun for so long….” Leylin looked at the blue and white sky and the golden rays of sunlight. Momentarily, he felt emotional. Although there were sun stones and spells of everlasting light in Twilight Zone, they were artificial after all. They could never be compared to the the light and warmth the natural sun gave. Those who lived in Twilight Zone for a long time constantly faced a land and sky made of thick black rock. It left them depressed, and on occasion could lead to serious problems as well. Even though Leylin didn’t have such misfortune, he did not want to risk it anymore. He never wanted to leave the luxurious space and experience the radiance of the actual sun brought again. Those constantly under the sun would never understand the others who had been in the dark and who looked forward to its natural radiance! As the airship picked up speed, the airflow on the deck increased tremendously, enough to blow away an adult. Of course, in such a situation, Leylin was unfazed and couldn’t hear the announcement made for everyone to retreat to their rooms. He allowed the strong winds to envelop him all around. “Very beautiful, isn’t it ?” A sweet female voice was heard. Leylin turned to his right and saw a young lady holding tightly to the railing. She was tip-toeing and attempting to gaze at the scenery beneath. Beneath them, past the sea of clouds, patches of farmland and crops could be seen. The windmills appeared to be toy-sized and the outline of the city far away. Tiny dots of black were moving about on the roads. “My name is Jessia, how about you?” The young lady amplified her voice when Leylin failed to give her the attention she craved. “Leylin!” He replied with no emotions. Leylin felt the energy rolling off the lady in waves, she was a rank 1. She could be considered a genius considering her rank 1 status at such a young age, but too bad, Leylin deemed her insignificant. “So, Leylin where are you from?” The young female Magus was not frustrated that Leylin ignored her, instead she started to ask more questions. “What kind of power do you possess? Where do you intend to go? Do you like the flower cape jasmine? I like staffs made of walnut, I believe they enhance my magic power, and they smell nice too…” She chirped on like a sparrow, asking a chain of questions. “You…” Leylin rolled his eyes and was about to speak up when another voice spoke from behind him. “Jessia, what are you doing?” Leylin turned around. A young Magus wearing a golden white robe with a red ruby emblem on it walked towards them, anger hidden in his eyes. “No… nothing… I am just out here looking around…” Jessia pulled back her head, looking pitiful. “Since you are done looking, head back in now! It is dangerous out here!” The youth repressed the smile on his face. “Sir Leylin, I’ll look for you next time!” Jessia waved while walking away, and the youth was clearly displeased. He looked at Leylin, his lip parted to speak, but did not do so. He shot a darting look filled with warning towards Leylin and turned to walk back into the cabin. “Ridiculous!” Leylin shook his head in disbelief. He knew the young female Magus had used him as a reason to dodge herself from the wrath of the young Magus and that made Leylin form negative impressions towards both of them. It was clearly evident that they had not discovered Leylin’s hidden undulating energy, hence one regarded him as a saviour, yet another unknowingly did not dare to challenge him. “Kubler, come here!” Leylin looked at secret imprint on his hand. “Master! What are your instructions?” Kubler got onto the deck swiftly and replied respectfully with a bow. “Do you know this symbol?” Leylin projected an image of the red ruby emblem that the young Magus was wearing. Judging from the proud persona of the young Magus wearing the ruby red emblem on his chest, Leylin suspected it could be the symbol of a powerful Magus. Unfortunately, he had no idea at all and had to endure the critical look from him. Luckily, following Leylin along this journey was a Magus from the central continent, who was knowledgeable and was able to answer many of his questions.
