Now there are no words to describe him. He is no longer a boyish rogue, not by any stretch of the imagination, but a tormented man, driven by secrets, silent about what he’s done since he disappeared. \n Isabel knew how to handle the reckless youth he’d been, but this new husband of hers... this darkly passionate man is not tamable. Does she dare explore the places inside herself that Gray demands to possess? Does she trust him enough to bare herself completely to a lover who is an irresistible stranger?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-stranger-i-married-historical-2.jpg","author":"Sylvia Day","type":"Historical","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":35,"category":{"id":20,"name":"Historical","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
