{"id":5947,"no":56,"title":"Part 6 Chapter 8","content":"MICHAELMAS came and passed, and Jude and his wife, who had lived but a short time in her father\u0027s house after their remarriage, were in lodgings on the top floor of a dwelling nearer to the centre of the city. He had done a few days\u0027 work during the two or three months since the event, but his health had been indifferent, and it was now precarious. He was sitting in an arm-chair before the fire, and coughed a good deal. \"I\u0027ve got a bargain for my trouble in marrying thee over again!\" Arabella was saying to him. \"I shall have to keep \u0027ee entirely-- that\u0027s what \u0027twill come to! I shall have to make black-pot and sausages, and hawk \u0027em about the street, all to support an invalid husband I\u0027d no business to be saddled with at all. Why didn\u0027t you keep your health, deceiving one like this? You were well enough when the wedding was!\" \"Ah, yes!\" said he, laughing acridly. \"I have been thinking of my foolish feeling about the pig you and I killed during our first marriage. I feel now that the greatest mercy that could be vouchsafed to me would be that something should serve me as I served that animal.\" This was the sort of discourse that went on between them every day now. The landlord of the lodging, who had heard that they were a queer couple, had doubted if they were married at all, especially as he had seen Arabella kiss Jude one evening when she had taken a little cordial; and he was about to give them notice to quit, till by chance overhearing her one night haranguing Jude in rattling terms, and ultimately flinging a shoe at his head, he recognized the note of genuine wedlock; and concluding that they must be respectable, said no more. Jude did not get any better, and one day he requested Arabella, with considerable hesitation, to execute a commission for him. She asked him indifferently what it was. \"To write to Sue.\" \"What in the name--do you want me to write to her for?\" \"To ask how she is, and if she\u0027ll come to see me, because I\u0027m ill, and should like to see her--once again.\" \"It is like you to insult a lawful wife by asking such a thing!\" \"It is just in order not to insult you that I ask you to do it. You know I love Sue. I don\u0027t wish to mince the matter-- there stands the fact: I love her. I could find a dozen ways of sending a letter to her without your knowledge. But I wish to be quite above-board with you, and with her husband. A message through you asking her to come is at least free from any odour of intrigue. If she retains any of her old nature at all, she\u0027ll come.\" \"You\u0027ve no respect for marriage whatever, or its rights and duties!\" \"What DOES it matter what my opinions are--a wretch like me! Can it matter to anybody in the world who comes to see me for half an hour--here with one foot in the grave! ... Come, please write, Arabella!\" he pleaded. \"Repay my candour by a little generosity!\" \"I should think NOT!\" \"Not just once?--Oh do!\" He felt that his physical weakness had taken away all his dignity. \"What do you want HER to know how you are for? She don\u0027t want to see \u0027ee. She\u0027s the rat that forsook the sinking ship!\" \"Don\u0027t, don\u0027t!\" \"And I stuck to un--the more fool I! Have that strumpet in the house indeed!\" Almost as soon as the words were spoken Jude sprang from the chair, and before Arabella knew where she was he had her on her back upon a little couch which stood there, he kneeling above her. \"Say another word of that sort,\" he whispered, \"and I\u0027ll kill you-- here and now! I\u0027ve everything to gain by it--my own death not being the least part. So don\u0027t think there\u0027s no meaning in what I say!\" \"What do you want me to do?\" gasped Arabella. \"Promise never to speak of her.\" \"Very well. I do.\" \"I take your word,\" he said scornfully as he loosened her. \"But what it is worth I can\u0027t say.\" \"You couldn\u0027t kill the pig, but you could kill me!\" \"Ah--there you have me! No--I couldn\u0027t kill you--even in a passion. Taunt away!\" He then began coughing very much, and she estimated his life with an appraiser\u0027s eye as he sank back ghastly pale. \"I\u0027ll send for her,\" Arabella murmured, \"if you\u0027ll agree to my being in the room with you all the time she\u0027s here.\" The softer side of his nature, the desire to see Sue, made him unable to resist the offer even now, provoked as he had been; and he replied breathlessly: \"Yes, I agree. Only send for her!\" In the evening he inquired if she had written. \"Yes,\" she said; \"I wrote a note telling her you were ill, and asking her to come to-morrow or the day after. I haven\u0027t posted it yet.\" The next day Jude wondered if she really did post it, but would not ask her; and foolish Hope, that lives on a drop and a crumb, made him restless with expectation. He knew the times of the possible trains, and listened on each occasion for sounds of her. She did not come; but Jude would not address Arabella again thereon. He hoped and expected all the next day; but no Sue appeared; neither was there any note of reply. Then Jude decided in the privacy of his mind that Arabella had never posted hers, although she had written it. There was something in her manner which told it. His physical weakness was such that he shed tears at the disappointment when she was not there to see. His suspicions were, in fact, well founded. Arabella, like some other nurses, thought that your duty towards your invalid was to pacify him by any means short of really acting upon his fancies. He never said another word to her about his wish or his conjecture. A silent, undiscerned resolve grew up in him, which gave him, if not strength, stability and calm. One midday when, after an absence of two hours, she came into the room, she beheld the chair empty. Down she flopped on the bed, and sitting, meditated. \"Now where the devil is my man gone to!\" she said. A driving rain from the north-east had been falling with more or less intermission all the morning, and looking from the window at the dripping spouts it seemed impossible to believe that any sick man would have ventured out to almost certain death. Yet a conviction possessed Arabella that he had gone out, and it became a certainty when she had searched the house. \"If he\u0027s such a fool, let him be!\" she said. \"I can do no more.\" Jude was at that moment in a railway train that was drawing near to Alfredston, oddly swathed, pale as a monumental figure in alabaster, and much stared at by other passengers. An hour later his thin form, in the long great-coat and blanket he had come with, but without an umbrella, could have been seen walking along the five-mile road to Marygreen. On his face showed the determined purpose that alone sustained him, but to which has weakness afforded a sorry foundation. By the up-hill walk he was quite blown, but he pressed on; and at half-past three o\u0027clock stood by the familiar well at Marygreen. The rain was keeping everybody indoors; Jude crossed the green to the church without observation, and found the building open. Here he stood, looking forth at the school, whence he could hear the usual sing-song tones of the little voices that had not learnt Creation\u0027s groan. He waited till a small boy came from the school--one evidently allowed out before hours for some reason or other. Jude held up his hand, and the child came. \"Please call at the schoolhouse and ask Mrs. Phillotson if she will be kind enough to come to the church for a few minutes.\" The child departed, and Jude heard him knock at the door of the dwelling. He himself went further into the church. Everything was new, except a few pieces of carving preserved from the wrecked old fabric, now fixed against the new walls. He stood by these: they seemed akin to the perished people of that place who were his ancestors and Sue\u0027s. A light footstep, which might have been accounted no more than an added drip to the rainfall, sounded in the porch, and he looked round. \"Oh--I didn\u0027t think it was you! I didn\u0027t--Oh, Jude!\" A hysterical catch in her breath ended in a succession of them. He advanced, but she quickly recovered and went back. \"Don\u0027t go--don\u0027t go!\" he implored. \"This is my last time! I thought it would be less intrusive than to enter your house. And I shall never come again. Don\u0027t then be unmerciful. Sue, Sue! We are acting by the letter; and \u0027the letter killeth\u0027!\" \"I\u0027ll stay--I won\u0027t be unkind!\" she said, her mouth quivering and her tears flowing as she allowed him to come closer. \"But why did you come, and do this wrong thing, after doing such a right thing as you have done?\" \"What right thing?\" \"Marrying Arabella again. It was in the Alfredston paper. She has never been other than yours, Jude--in a proper sense. And therefore you did so well--Oh so well!--in recognizing it-- and taking her to you again.\" \"God above--and is that all I\u0027ve come to hear? If there is anything more degrading, immoral, unnatural, than another in my life, it is this meretricious contract with Arabella which has been called doing the right thing! And you too--you call yourself Phillotson\u0027s wife! HIS wife! You are mine.\" \"Don\u0027t make me rush away from you--I can\u0027t bear much! But on this point I am decided.\" \"I cannot understand how you did it--how you think it-- I cannot!\" \"Never mind that. He is a kind husband to me--And I-- I\u0027ve wrestled and struggled, and fasted, and prayed. I have nearly brought my body into complete subjection. And you mustn\u0027t--will you--wake--\" \"Oh you darling little fool; where is your reason? You seem to have suffered the loss of your faculties! I would argue with you if I didn\u0027t know that a woman in your state of feeling is quite beyond all appeals to her brains. Or is it that you are humbugging yourself, as so many women do about these things; and don\u0027t actually believe what you pretend to, and only are indulging in the luxury of the emotion raised by an affected belief?\" \"Luxury! How can you be so cruel!\" \"You dear, sad, soft, most melancholy wreck of a promising human intellect that it has ever been my lot to behold! Where is your scorn of convention gone? I WOULD have died game!\" \"You crush, almost insult me, Jude! Go away from me!\" She turned off quickly. \"I will. I would never come to see you again, even if I had the strength to come, which I shall not have any more. Sue, Sue, you are not worth a man\u0027s love!\" Her bosom began to go up and down. \"I can\u0027t endure you to say that!\" she burst out, and her eye resting on him a moment, she turned back impulsively. \"Don\u0027t, don\u0027t scorn me! Kiss me, oh kiss me lots of times, and say I am not a coward and a contemptible humbug-- I can\u0027t bear it!\" She rushed up to him and, with her mouth on his, continued: \"I must tell you--oh I must--my darling Love! It has been--only a church marriage--an apparent marriage I mean! He suggested it at the very first!\" \"How?\" \"I mean it is a nominal marriage only. It hasn\u0027t been more than that at all since I came back to him!\" \"Sue!\" he said. Pressing her to him in his arms he bruised her lips with kisses: \"If misery can know happiness, I have a moment\u0027s happiness now! Now, in the name of all you hold holy, tell me the truth, and no lie. You do love me still?\" \"I do! You know it too well! ... But I MUSTN\u0027T do this! I mustn\u0027t kiss you back as I would!\" \"But do!\" \"And yet you are so dear!--and you look so ill----\" \"And so do you! There\u0027s one more, in memory of our dead little children-- yours and mine!\" The words struck her like a blow, and she bent her head. \"I MUSTN\u0027T--I CAN\u0027T go on with this!\" she gasped presently. \"But there, there, darling; I give you back your kisses; I do, I do! ... And now I\u0027ll HATE myself for ever for my sin!\" \"No--let me make my last appeal. Listen to this! We\u0027ve both remarried out of our senses. I was made drunk to do it. You were the same. I was gin-drunk; you were creed-drunk. Either form of intoxication takes away the nobler vision.... Let us then shake off our mistakes, and run away together!\" \"No; again no! ... Why do you tempt me so far, Jude! It is too merciless! ... But I\u0027ve got over myself now. Don\u0027t follow me--don\u0027t look at me. Leave me, for pity\u0027s sake!\" She ran up the church to the east end, and Jude did as she requested. He did not turn his head, but took up his blanket, which she had not seen, and went straight out. As he passed the end of the church she heard his coughs mingling with the rain on the windows, and in a last instinct of human affection, even now unsubdued by her fetters, she sprang up as if to go and succour him. But she knelt down again, and stopped her ears with her hands till all possible sound of him had passed away. He was by this time at the corner of the green, from which the path ran across the fields in which he had scared rooks as a boy. He turned and looked back, once, at the building which still contained Sue; and then went on, knowing that his eyes would light on that scene no more. There are cold spots up and down Wessex in autumn and winter weather; but the coldest of all when a north or east wind is blowing is the crest of the down by the Brown House, where the road to Alfredston crosses the old Ridgeway. Here the first winter sleets and snows fall and lie, and here the spring frost lingers last unthawed. Here in the teeth of the north-east wind and rain Jude now pursued his way, wet through, the necessary slowness of his walk from lack of his former strength being insufficent to maintain his heat. He came to the milestone, and, raining as it was, spread his blanket and lay down there to rest. Before moving on he went and felt at the back of the stone for his own carving. It was still there; but nearly obliterated by moss. He passed the spot where the gibbet of his ancestor and Sue\u0027s had stood, and descended the hill. It was dark when he reached Alfredston, where he had a cup of tea, the deadly chill that began to creep into his bones being too much for him to endure fasting. To get home he had to travel by a steam tram-car, and two branches of railway, with much waiting at a junction. He did not reach Christminster till ten o\u0027clock. 米迦勒节来了又去了，裘德和他的妻子再次结婚后，在她父亲家住的时间并不长，随后搬到离基督堂城中心较近的一所公寓顶层的房间。 婚后两三个月他只于过有限几天活，身体每况愈下，病情险恶。他坐在火边的扶手椅上，咳嗽得很厉害。 “我这回又跟你结了婚，算是做了笔倒霉生意。”阿拉贝拉正说给他听。“我以后只好一直养着你啦——以后的日子就是这样啦！我只好做血肠跟腊肠，上街吆喝着卖啦，全都为养活一个有病的男人，我又何必找这份罪受啊。你干吗不好好保养，这么坑人哪？结婚时候，你不是挺好嘛！” “啊，就是呀！”他说，气得只好苦笑着。“我一直想着咱们头回结婚之后，那会儿你跟我宰猪时候我那个糊涂想法，这会儿我觉着要是拿收抬那个畜牲的办法收抬我，那才是大恩大德哩。” 这是他们每天必来一回的对话。公寓的老板听说他们这一对非常古怪，疑心他们压根儿没结过婚，特别是有天晚上他看见阿拉贝拉因为一时有点回心转意，吻了裘德，疑心就更大了；他已经打算通知他们走人，后来他又在一天夜里偶然偷听到她叽哩咕噜数落裘德，临了还把一只鞋往他脑袋上摔，这才了然他们这样的确是结了婚的夫妇，认定他们还算是正派人，也就没再说什么。 裘德身体始终不见好。一天他吞吞吐吐地请阿拉贝拉替他办件事。她带搭不理地问什么事。 “给苏写封信。” “你凭什么要我替你——给她写信，想干什么？” “问问她近况，能不能来看看我，因为我病了，很想见她——再见一回。” “你叫我干这宗子事，你这不是侮辱正配夫人嘛！” “我就是因为不想侮辱你，才请你写。你也知道我爱苏。我不想瞒着你——事情是明摆着的。我也可以想出来十几种办法瞒着你，但是我很想对你，也对她丈夫完全做到光明磊落。托你写封信叫她来，怎么说也不算损人的阴招。要是她还是老脾气，她准会来。” “反正你对婚姻一点不尊重，什么婚姻的权利跟义务一点不在乎。” “我这样的可怜虫怎么个意思，有什么了不起的！谁来看我，半个钟头的事儿，根本碍不着谁——我这会儿都土埋半截啦！……劳你驾写一写吧，阿拉贝拉！”他央告着。“你就算认我还老实，就宽宏大量点吧！” “我就是不写！” “连一回都不写——哦，写吧！”他感到自己衰弱不堪，再顾不上脸面了。 “你让她来看你，究竟什么打算？她才不想来看你呢。她是隔岸观火，与己无关。” “别说啦，别说啦。” “我呢，死粘着你不撒开，就更傻啦！让那个婊子进家门，还得了！” 她这话差不多刚出口，裘德就从椅子上蹦起来，阿拉贝拉还来不及明白，他就把她头朝上背朝下按在旁边放的软榻上，两个膝头卡住她。 “你要是再说那样的话。”他小声说。“我就宰了你——一点不耽误！我宰了你，我就一了百了——我自己死也死得值了。你可别拿我的话不当回事。” “那你想叫我干什么？”阿拉贝拉气堵着说。 “不许你以后再说她，答应不答应？” “答应，不说啦！” “我信你的。”他一边松开她，一边口气轻蔑地说。“不过你的话算不算数，我还没法说。” “你宰不了猪，倒还想宰我！” “啊——你这算把我说准啦！是啊——我不会宰了你——就算真急了——也不一定把你宰了。你混骂好啦。” 跟着他剧烈地咳嗽起来，脸白得跟死人一样，一下又跌坐到椅子上。而她却以一个估价人的眼光忖度他的寿命。“要是你肯答应她在这儿的时候，我可以一直在旁边，”阿拉贝拉咕哝着，“那我就写。” 他生有不忍之仁，兼以渴望见到苏，纵使到了现在这种局面，虽然他已气昏了，可是他还是无法回绝她这个意见，于是他说，“我答应。只要你给她写信就行。” 晚上他问写了没有。 “写了，我写了个条子，说你病了，请她明后天来。还没寄出去。” 第二天，裘德纳闷信究竟寄没寄，不过也没问她。他的希望本属蠢不可及，犹如空中楼阁，风中游丝，可是因为他一心盼着苏来，整天折腾得坐立不安，心急如焚。他知道每班火车的大致时间，所以到时候，就倾耳细听她来了没来。 她没来；但是裘德也不想再跟阿拉贝拉过话。他把所有希望和心愿都放到第二天上；苏还是没露面；而且连个简单的复信也没有。裘德暗自琢磨，肯定阿拉贝拉信是写了，却根本没寄出去，从她的态度上也大致看得出来。他身体如此虚弱，阿拉贝拉不在眼前，他竟因失望而潸然泪下。他的猜疑实际上完全有道理。阿拉贝拉也跟另外一些护士没什么两样，认为对病人的责任固然是要用种种办法哄他们安心治病，至于他们有什么奇想妄念就大可不必去操心。 这之后，他对她一个字儿也没提过他的愿望或猜测，他暗暗下了决心，胸有成竹，守口如瓶。这个决心即使不能说给他增添了力量，也叫他心里踏实、安定。有一天，阿拉贝拉外出两个钟头，中午时分回来，一进屋子，就看见椅子空着。 她往床上一靠，又坐起来，细细想了想。“这家伙他妈的上哪儿去了？” 一上午，从东边过来的雨浙浙沥沥没个停，隔着窗户看得见屋檐在滴水。一个身患重病的人这时候不顾死活，硬往外跑，似乎不大可能。不过阿拉贝拉确实认为他人出去了，这没什么可疑惑的；一当她把整个屋子搜遍了，她这想法就成为确凿的事实了。“他这么个糊涂东西，就活该去受吧！”她说。“我管不了啦。” 裘德此刻却坐火车快到阿尔夫瑞顿了，身上裹得怪模怪样，脸白得像石膏像，别的旅客都盯着他看。一个钟头以后，可以瞧见他的瘦弱身形，穿着长大衣，裹着毯子，没打伞，顺着五英里长的大路，向马利格林走去。从他脸上的神情看得出来，他这一路全靠义无反顾的决心撑着；不过他病得这样厉害，这样的决心只有百害而无一利，实是可悲。上山时，他已筋疲力竭，可是他继续咬牙向前。三点半光景，他站在马利格林那口熟悉的井边。因为下雨，人人都呆在家里，裘德走过草地，到了教堂，没人看见；他发现教堂大门没关死，他站在那儿，望着前面的学校，居然听见了孩子们通常像唱歌一样的悦耳的朗读声，这样的童声是丝毫没领略过人生的苦涩的。 他等着，终于有个男孩从学校出来了——显然他是为了什么事，老师准许他提前离校。裘德朝他招招手，孩子就过来了。 “我想请你到老师家里去一下，问问费乐生太太还能抽空到教堂来一下。” 孩子去了，裘德听见他敲老师家的门。他自己先一步进了教堂。一切都是新的，只有几件从残砖剩瓦中拣出来的雕像安装在新墙壁上。他就在这些东西旁边站着，它们仿佛同原住此地、早经过世的他的祖先和苏的祖先有过血缘关系。 门廊上响起了轻轻的脚步声，轻到差不多跟雨滴声分辨不出来，他回头一看。 “没想到是你啊！没想到——哦，裘德！”她的呼吸歇斯底里地哽住了，连续硬了之后才缓过来。他朝她走去，但她很快恢复了常态，转身想走。 “别走——别走！”他央告着。“我这是最后一回啦！我考虑过了，到这儿来，不像上你们家那样莽撞。我以后再不来了。别那么无情无义吧，苏啊，苏啊！咱们现在一言一行都抠着法律字眼儿办哪，可是‘法律致人死’啊。” “我不走——我心里决不狠。”她答应他走过来，嘴唇颤动，泪如泉涌。“你干吗来啊？你不是做对了吗？干吗又做错事呢？” “做对了什么？” “跟阿拉贝拉又结了婚啊。阿尔夫瑞顿的报上登了。她压根儿就是你的人哪，裘德——这本是正理嘛。所以你这事办得太好啦——哦，太好啦！——你总算明白过来啦——又把她娶回去啦。” “老天爷呀——我上这儿来就是为听这一套吗？按我这辈子，要说我干了什么更下流、更无耻、更逆天违理的事，那就莫过于我跟阿拉贝拉订的嫖娼卖淫契约了，可你居然说我做对了！而你也——自称费乐生的妻子！他的妻子！你明明是我的妻子！” “你这不是一个劲儿赶我走吗——你这么胡说八道，我可受不了！反正这件事，我是站得住拿得稳的。” “我真不懂你这是怎么搞的——你这是怎么想出来的——真是不懂！” “这用不着你管。他是个有情有义的丈夫——我折腾过，挣扎过，斋戒过，祈祷过，总算信服得五体投地，别无杂念啦。你千万别——你想——唤醒我——” “哦，你这个亲爱的小傻瓜哟！你的理性跑哪儿去啦！仿佛你的整个推理能力全丧失啦！我既然知道你是有这样想法的女人，已经到了无理可喻的地步，那我又何必再枉费唇舌呢。不然的话，那你就是自欺欺人，跟好多女人如出一辙了。你装着信的那一套，实际上你一点也不信，你这不就是故作虔诚，恣意玩弄感情吗？” “玩弄感情，你怎么能这么损人！” “你的灵性本来是无限光明，我有幸深知，可是如今这灵性全毁了，成了叫人爱，叫人悲，叫人苦，叫人无限神伤的一堆破烂啦！你从前对习俗的蔑弃哪儿去啦？我呢，我可是坚持到底，宁折不弯啊！” “你这是逼我死呀，你简直是糟蹋我呀，裘德！你滚吧！”她立刻转身就走。 “我滚！我决不会再来见你。就算我还有气力来，我怎么也不来啦。苏啊，苏啊，你不配一个男人的爱情！” 她胸部开始一起一伏。“你这些话，我真听不下去啦！”她脱口而出，先注视他一下子，随即在冲动中转过身来。“别瞧不起我吧，别瞧不起我吧，哦，吻我吧，多多吻我吧，说我不是个胆小鬼吧，说我不是个下贱的骗子吧——我实在受不了啦！”她奔到他跟前，够着他，把嘴放在他嘴上，接着说，“我得告诉你——哦，得告诉你——我的至爱的爱人哪！那——充其极是个教堂里的婚姻——我是说做给人看的婚姻！他起先就这么表示的！” “到底是怎么回事呢？” “我是说那仅仅是有名无实的婚姻罢啦。打从我回到他那儿，一直是那么回事！” “苏啊！”他说，把她抱得紧紧的，吻得她嘴唇都疼了。“如果说，悲伤的心还能感到快乐，那我这会儿就顷刻有了快乐啦！哪，凭你认为神圣的一切，跟我说实话，别撒谎。你现在还真爱我吗？” “真爱！你自己不是清楚嘛！……不过我决不该这样爱啦！因为你吻我，我就回吻你，太不该啦！” “不过你得回吻哪！” “你还是那么招人疼——你病到这样——” “你也一样招人疼啊！好啦，再吻一回吧，纪念死了的孩子——你的，也是我的！” 她一听这话就像挨了狠狠一击，低了头。“我不该——我不能这样下去啦！”随即大口喘气。“不过，哪哪，亲亲；我回你吻，我回啦，回啦！……现在为我的罪过，我要一辈子痛恨自己啦！” “别这样——让我最后表表心迹吧。听着！咱们两个都是因为当时神志昏馈结了婚的。我是叫人灌醉了才干出来的。你也一样。我是叫金酒灌醉的，你是叫宗教信条迷醉的。都是沉醉不醒，形式不同，反正把咱们高尚的理想都给卷走了。……咱们就把自己的错误甩掉，一块儿逃走吧！” “不行，一百个不行；你引诱我，怎么到这地步啦，裘德！你做得太不仁不义啦！……不过我现在又清醒过来啦。别跟着我——别瞧我。可怜可怜我，让我走！” 她直朝教堂东头跑去，裘德听她的话没追过去。他没掉过头看，而是拿起刚才她没看见的那块毯子，径直出了教堂。就在他出了教堂那一刻，她听见他的咳嗽声同打在窗上的雨点声混在一起。而那人类固有的恻隐本能，纵使她那些戒律也禁锢不了，她一跃而起，仿佛想要追上去救护他。然而她却又跪倒在地，两手捂住耳朵，一直捂到再也听不到他的声音。 他那时走到草地边角上，小路从那儿穿过，延伸到他小时候赶老鸹的麦田。他又回头望了望苏隐身在内的教堂，心知自己决不会再看见那样的情景了。 维塞克斯郡从南到北，有些地方人了秋冬就很冷了，但是最冷的地方要数北风和东风呼啸而过的栋房子旁边低地的凸起处，大路正是从这儿横穿“山脊路”到阿尔夫瑞顿。那一带已经下过几场冻雨和雪，在地上冻住不化，而春天的雪也要好晚才融掉。裘德就在北边过来的凄风苦雨中从这儿赶路，浑身淋得湿透；由于他已经不像从前壮实，只好慢慢走，可这样就不足以维持身上的热气了。他走到里程碑那儿，尽管雨还下着，还是把毯子铺在地上，躺下来休息。在继续赶路之前，他过去摸了摸碑阴上自己刻的字。字还在，不过差不多让苔薛盖满了。他从原先竖着自己和苏的祖先受刑的绞架的地方走过去，下了山。 他到阿尔夫瑞顿已经天黑，峭寒逼人，砭肌刺骨。他空着肚子，实在受不了，莫奈何在镇上买了杯茶喝。要到家，他先得乘汽轨车，然后换坐两条支线的火车，还得在联络点上等老半天，到基督堂时候已经十点了。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/292/7830.html","bookId":190,"book":{"id":190,"title":"无名的裘德
