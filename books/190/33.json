{"id":5924,"no":33,"title":"Part 4 Chapter 1","content":"SHASTON, the ancient British Palladour, From whose foundation first such strange reports arise, (as Drayton sang it), was, and is, in itself the city of a dream. Vague imaginings of its castle, its three mints, its magnificent apsidal abbey, the chief glory of South Wessex, its twelve churches, its shrines, chantries, hospitals, its gabled freestone mansions-- all now ruthlessly swept away--throw the visitor, even against his will, into a pensive melancholy, which the stimulating atmosphere and limitless landscape around him can scarcely dispel. The spot was the burial-place of a king and a queen, of abbots and abbesses, saints and bishops, knights and squires. The bones of King Edward \"the Martyr,\" carefully removed hither for holy preservation, brought Shaston a renown which made it the resort of pilgrims from every part of Europe, and enabled it to maintain a reputation extending far beyond English shores. To this fair creation of the great Middle-Age the Dissolution was, as historians tell us, the death-knell. With the destruction of the enormous abbey the whole place collapsed in a general ruin: the Martyr\u0027s bones met with the fate of the sacred pile that held them, and not a stone is now left to tell where they lie. The natural picturesqueness and singularity of the town still remain; but strange to say these qualities, which were noted by many writers in ages when scenic beauty is said to have been unappreciated, are passed over in this, and one of the queerest and quaintest spots in England stands virtually unvisited to-day. It has a unique position on the summit of a steep and imposing scarp, rising on the north, south, and west sides of the borough out of the deep alluvial Vale of Blackmoor, the view from the Castle Green over three counties of verdant pasture--South, Mid, and Nether Wessex-- being as sudden a surprise to the unexpectant traveller\u0027s eyes as the medicinal air is to his lungs. Impossible to a railway, it can best be reached on foot, next best by light vehicles; and it is hardly accessible to these but by a sort of isthmus on the north-east, that connects it with the high chalk table-land on that side. Such is, and such was, the now world-forgotten Shaston or Palladour. Its situation rendered water the great want of the town; and within living memory, horses, donkeys and men may have been seen toiling up the winding ways to the top of the height, laden with tubs and barrels filled from the wells beneath the mountain, and hawkers retailing their contents at the price of a halfpenny a bucketful. This difficulty in the water supply, together with two other odd facts, namely, that the chief graveyard slopes up as steeply as a roof behind the church, and that in former times the town passed through a curious period of corruption, conventual and domestic, gave rise to the saying that Shaston was remarkable for three consolations to man, such as the world afforded not elsewhere. It was a place where the churchyard lay nearer heaven than the church steeple, where beer was more plentiful than water, and where there were more wanton women than honest wives and maids. It is also said that after the Middle Ages the inhabitants were too poor to pay their priests, and hence were compelled to pull down their churches, and refrain altogether from the public worship of God; a necessity which they bemoaned over their cups in the settles of their inns on Sunday afternoons. In those days the Shastonians were apparently not without a sense of humour. There was another peculiarity--this a modern one--which Shaston appeared to owe to its site. It was the resting-place and headquarters of the proprietors of wandering vans, shows, shooting-galleries, and other itinerant concerns, whose business lay largely at fairs and markets. As strange wild birds are seen assembled on some lofty promontory, meditatively pausing for longer flights, or to return by the course they followed thither, so here, in this cliff-town, stood in stultified silence the yellow and green caravans bearing names not local, as if surprised by a change in the landscape so violent as to hinder their further progress; and here they usually remained all the winter till they turned to seek again their old tracks in the following spring. It was to this breezy and whimsical spot that Jude ascended from the nearest station for the first time in his life about four o\u0027clock one afternoon, and entering on the summit of the peak after a toilsome climb, passed the first houses of the aerial town; and drew towards the school-house. The hour was too early; the pupils were still in school, humming small, like a swarm of gnats; and he withdrew a few steps along Abbey Walk, whence he regarded the spot which fate had made the home of all he loved best in the world. In front of the schools, which were extensive and stone-built, grew two enormous beeches with smooth mouse-coloured trunks, as such trees will only grow on chalk uplands. Within the mullioned and transomed windows he could see the black, brown, and flaxen crowns of the scholars over the sills, and to pass the time away he walked down to the level terrace where the abbey gardens once had spread, his heart throbbing in spite of him. Unwilling to enter till the children were dismissed he remained here till young voices could be heard in the open air, and girls in white pinafores over red and blue frocks appeared dancing along the paths which the abbess, prioress, subprioress, and fifty nuns had demurely paced three centuries earlier. Retracing his steps he found that he had waited too long, and that Sue had gone out into the town at the heels of the last scholar, Mr. Phillotson having been absent all the afternoon at a teachers\u0027 meeting at Shottsford. Jude went into the empty schoolroom and sat down, the girl who was sweeping the floor having informed him that Mrs. Phillotson would be back again in a few minutes. A piano stood near-- actually the old piano that Phillotson had possessed at Marygreen-- and though the dark afternoon almost prevented him seeing the notes Jude touched them in his humble way, and could not help modulating into the hymn which had so affected him in the previous week. A figure moved behind him, and thinking it was still the girl with the broom Jude took no notice, till the person came close and laid her fingers lightly upon his bass hand. The imposed hand was a little one he seemed to know, and he turned. \"Don\u0027t stop,\" said Sue. \"I like it. I learnt it before I left Melchester. They used to play it in the training school.\" \"I can\u0027t strum before you! Play it for me.\" \"Oh well--I don\u0027t mind.\" Sue sat down, and her rendering of the piece, though not remarkable, seemed divine as compared with his own. She, like him, was evidently touched-- to her own surprise--by the recalled air; and when she had finished, and he moved his hand towards hers, it met his own half-way. Jude grasped it-- just as he had done before her marriage. \"It is odd,\" she said, in a voice quite changed, \"that I should care about that air; because----\" \"Because what?\" \"I am not that sort--quite.\" \"Not easily moved?\" \"I didn\u0027t quite mean that.\" \"Oh, but you ARE one of that sort, for you are just like me at heart!\" \"But not at head.\" She played on and suddenly turned round; and by an unpremeditated instinct each clasped the other\u0027s hand again. She uttered a forced little laugh as she relinquished his quickly. \"How funny!\" she said. \"I wonder what we both did that for?\" \"I suppose because we are both alike, as I said before.\" \"Not in our thoughts! Perhaps a little in our feelings.\" \"And they rule thoughts.... Isn\u0027t it enough to make one blaspheme that the composer of that hymn is one of the most commonplace men I ever met!\" \"What--you know him?\" \"I went to see him.\" \"Oh, you goose--to do just what I should have done! Why did you?\" \"Because we are not alike,\" he said drily. \"Now we\u0027ll have some tea,\" said Sue. \"Shall we have it here instead of in my house? It is no trouble to get the kettle and things brought in. We don\u0027t live at the school you know, but in that ancient dwelling across the way called Old-Grove Place. It is so antique and dismal that it depresses me dreadfully. Such houses are very well to visit, but not to live in-- I feel crushed into the earth by the weight of so many previous lives there spent. In a new place like these schools there is only your own life to support. Sit down, and I\u0027ll tell Ada to bring the tea-things across.\" He waited in the light of the stove, the door of which she flung open before going out, and when she returned, followed by the maiden with tea, they sat down by the same light, assisted by the blue rays of a spirit-lamp under the brass kettle on the stand. \"This is one of your wedding-presents to me,\" she said, signifying the latter. \"Yes,\" said Jude. The kettle of his gift sang with some satire in its note, to his mind; and to change the subject he said, \"Do you know of any good readable edition of the uncanonical books of the New Testament? You don\u0027t read them in the school I suppose?\" \"Oh dear no!--\u0027twould alarm the neighbourhood.... Yes, there is one. I am not familiar with it now, though I was interested in it when my former friend was alive. Cowper\u0027s APOCRYPHAL GOSPELS.\" \"That sounds like what I want.\" His thoughts, however reverted with a twinge to the \"former friend\"--by whom she meant, as he knew, the university comrade of her earlier days. He wondered if she talked of him to Phillotson. \"The Gospel of Nicodemus is very nice,\" she went on to keep him from his jealous thoughts, which she read clearly, as she always did. Indeed when they talked on an indifferent subject, as now, there was ever a second silent conversation passing between their emotions, so perfect was the reciprocity between them. \"It is quite like the genuine article. All cut up into verses, too; so that it is like one of the other evangelists read in a dream, when things are the same, yet not the same. But, Jude, do you take an interest in those questions still? Are you getting up APOLOGETICA?\" \"Yes. I am reading Divinity harder than ever.\" She regarded him curiously. \"Why do you look at me like that?\" said Jude. \"Oh--why do you want to know?\" \"I am sure you can tell me anything I may be ignorant of in that subject. You must have learnt a lot of everything from your dear dead friend!\" \"We won\u0027t get on to that now!\" she coaxed. \"Will you be carving out at that church again next week, where you learnt the pretty hymn?\" \"Yes, perhaps.\" \"That will be very nice. Shall I come and see you there? It is in this direction, and I could come any afternoon by train for half an hour?\" \"No. Don\u0027t come!\" \"What--aren\u0027t we going to be friends, then, any longer, as we used to be?\" \"No.\" \"I didn\u0027t know that. I thought you were always going to be kind to me!\" \"No, I am not.\" \"What have I done, then? I am sure I thought we two---- \" The TREMOLO in her voice caused her to break off. \"Sue, I sometimes think you are a flirt,\" said he abruptly. There was a momentary pause, till she suddenly jumped up; and to his surprise he saw by the kettle-flame that her face was flushed. \"I can\u0027t talk to you any longer, Jude!\" she said, the tragic contralto note having come back as of old. \"It is getting too dark to stay together like this, after playing morbid Good Friday tunes that make one feel what one shouldn\u0027t! ... We mustn\u0027t sit and talk in this way any more. Yes--you must go away, for you mistake me! I am very much the reverse of what you say so cruelly--Oh, Jude, it WAS cruel to say that! Yet I can\u0027t tell you the truth--I should shock you by letting you know how I give way to my impulses, and how much I feel that I shouldn\u0027t have been provided with attractiveness unless it were meant to be exercised! Some women\u0027s love of being loved is insatiable; and so, often, is their love of loving; and in the last case they may find that they can\u0027t give it continuously to the chamber-officer appointed by the bishop\u0027s licence to receive it. But you are so straightforward, Jude, that you can\u0027t understand me! ... Now you must go. I am sorry my husband is not at home.\" \"Are you?\" \"I perceive I have said that in mere convention! Honestly I don\u0027t think I am sorry. It does not matter, either way, sad to say!\" As they had overdone the grasp of hands some time sooner, she touched his fingers but lightly when he went out now. He had hardly gone from the door when, with a dissatisfied look, she jumped on a form and opened the iron casement of a window beneath which he was passing in the path without. \"When do you leave here to catch your train, Jude?\" she asked. He looked up in some surprise. \"The coach that runs to meet it goes in three-quarters of an hour or so.\" \"What will you do with yourself for the time?\" \"Oh--wander about, I suppose. Perhaps I shall go and sit in the old church.\" \"It does seem hard of me to pack you off so! You have thought enough of churches, Heaven knows, without going into one in the dark. Stay there.\" \"Where?\" \"Where you are. I can talk to you better like this than when you were inside.... It was so kind and tender of you to give up half a day\u0027s work to come to see me! ... You are Joseph the dreamer of dreams, dear Jude. And a tragic Don Quixote. And sometimes you are St. Stephen, who, while they were stoning him, could see Heaven opened. Oh, my poor friend and comrade, you\u0027ll suffer yet!\" Now that the high window-sill was between them, so that he could not get at her, she seemed not to mind indulging in a frankness she had feared at close quarters. \"I have been thinking,\" she continued, still in the tone of one brimful of feeling, \"that the social moulds civilization fits us into have no more relation to our actual shapes than the conventional shapes of the constellations have to the real star-patterns. I am called Mrs. Richard Phillotson, living a calm wedded life with my counterpart of that name. But I am not really Mrs. Richard Phillotson, but a woman tossed about, all alone, with aberrant passions, and unaccountable antipathies.... Now you mustn\u0027t wait longer, or you will lose the coach. Come and see me again. You must come to the house then.\" \"Yes!\" said Jude. \"When shall it be?\" \"To-morrow week. Good-bye--good-bye!\" She stretched out her hand and stroked his forehead pitifully--just once. Jude said good-bye, and went away into the darkness. Passing along Bimport Street he thought he heard the wheels of the coach departing, and, truly enough, when he reached the Duke\u0027s Arms in the Market Place the coach had gone. It was impossible for him to get to the station on foot in time for this train, and he settled himself perforce to wait for the next-- the last to Melchester that night. He wandered about awhile, obtained something to eat; and then, having another half-hour on his hands, his feet involuntarily took him through the venerable graveyard of Trinity Church, with its avenues of limes, in the direction of the schools again. They were entirely in darkness. She had said she lived over the way at Old-Grove Place, a house which he soon discovered from her description of its antiquity. A glimmering candlelight shone from a front window, the shutters being yet unclosed. He could see the interior clearly-- the floor sinking a couple of steps below the road without, which had become raised during the centuries since the house was built. Sue, evidently just come in, as standing with her hat on in this front parlour or sitting-room, whose walls were lined with wainscoting of panelled oak reaching from floor to ceiling, the latter being crossed by huge moulded beams only a little way above her head. The mantelpiece was of the same heavy description, carved with Jacobean pilasters and scroll-work. The centuries did, indeed, ponderously overhang a young wife who passed her time here. She had opened a rosewood work-box, and was looking at a photograph. Having contemplated it a little while she pressed it against her bosom, and put it again in its place. Then becoming aware that she had not obscured the windows she came forward to do so, candle in hand. It was too dark for her to see Jude without, but he could see her face distinctly, and there was an unmistakable tearfulness about the dark, long-lashed eyes. She closed the shutters, and Jude turned away to pursue his solitary journey home. \"Whose photograph was she looking at?\" he said. He had once given her his; but she had others, he knew. Yet it was his, surely? He knew he should go to see her again, according to her invitation. Those earnest men he read of, the saints, whom Sue, with gentle irreverence, called his demi-gods, would have shunned such encounters if they doubted their own strength. But he could not. He might fast and pray during the whole interval, but the human was more powerful in him than the Divine. 沙氏顿，古代不列颠的帕拉都，诚如德列顿所吟咏的： 一自建置始，多少奇闻异说流布于世。 不论过去，还是现在，它始终是一座梦幻般城市。它拥有过自己的一切：城堡、三所造币厂、以南维塞克斯的主要光荣见称的壮丽的半圆式大教堂、十二座教堂、圣贤凤歌祷堂、医院，以及筑有山墙的沙石府邸——历史无情，这一切至今已完全夷为平地。游客登临，抚今追昔，往往不胜怅惘。气象令人神驰，极目景象无际，却仍难以排解这种情绪。此地还曾是一位国王和一位王后，许多院。庵的住持和女住持，许多圣者和主教、骑士和侍从的安葬之地。当年“殉国者”爱德华的遗骸曾为人小心谨慎地移葬于此，以示崇敬，并得垂诸久远。欧洲各地的朝拜者于是纷至沓来，沙氏顿因此而声名大振，远播英国本土之外。然而史家告诉我们，“大消解” 给伟大中世纪这份杰作敲响了丧钟。规模宏伟的大教堂既经摧毁，荡然无遗，整个地方也随之土崩瓦解，沦为废墟。“殉国者”的遗骸只落得跟奉祀它的陵寝一同化为乌有，如今竟无片石残垒遗留，以昭示其故址所在。 这市镇天然美景如画，迥绝独出，至今风貌不异曩时。说来也怪，据说在以往人们不解欣赏风景美的时代，它的特色倒颇为许多作家瞩目，而沿至今日，英国这块最罕见、最富奇趣的地方依然受到冷落，实际上无人光顾。 它位于一个险峻雄奇的悬崖之巅，举世无双。它的北、南。西三面从冲积层丰厚的布莱摩谷拔地而起，形成自治市区。从“城堡草地”远眺，维塞克斯三郡风光尽收眼底。思想上没准备的游客骋目所及，迥出意表，正如他不期然而饱吸令人神旺的空气，那样为之惊叹不已。这地方无法通火车，上下最好是依靠足力，其次算生轻便马车，但也只能走东北面那条同白垩质台地相联接的羊肠小道，此外别无坦途。 从古至今，这就是为世人遗忘的帕拉都转变成的沙氏顿。它的地势造成它终年缺水，居民只好到山下井里打水，装满大桶小桶，再由驴马驮运或由人背，从蜿蜒的山路爬上绝顶。再由小贩沿街叫卖，一桶水半个便士。此情此景，人们自是身历不忘。 除了缺水造成的困难，还有两件咄咄怪事。一是主要的教堂墓地如同屋顶一样往上斜，坡度很陡；再就是早年市镇经历过一个离奇的尼俗两界腐化不堪的时期，由此有了这样的顺口溜：沙氏顿，地方好，给男人，三宗宝，啥个地方也比不了。这三宗宝指的是：按教堂墓地的地形上天国比从教堂的尖阁去还近；啤酒的供应比水还足；淫荡的女人比忠实的妻子和贞洁的姑娘还多。据说中世纪之后，当地居民穷到了养不起牧师的程度，只好把教堂推倒，从此永远取消了对上帝的集体礼拜；又因为他们做出这样的事是出于不得已，于是每逢礼拜天下午就坐在小酒店的靠背椅上，一边举杯痛饮，一边长吁短叹。足见那些年沙氏顿人不乏幽默感。 沙氏顿另有一个特色——这却是近代的——要归功于它的地利。赶大篷车走江湖的、搭棚子推销货品的、开打靶场的，以及到处赶庙会集市做生意的行商游贩，一律到这地方歇脚，把它当成各行各业的宿营地。人们时常看见奇怪的野鸟翔集在高耸入云的崖角上，暂时停在那儿，默默思考着究竟是飞往更远的地方，还是按习惯的路线折回故地。而在这悬崖之镇上，同时停着许许多多标着异乡人姓名的大篷车，黄黄绿绿，呆头呆脑，大气不出，仿佛眼前景物变得太剧烈，吓得它们连一步也没法朝前挪了。它们通常在这地方过冬，来春再从旧路回去跑生意。 某个下午四点钟光景，裘德从距沙氏顿最近的火车站，平生第一次走上这天风浩浩、神秘莫测的地方；经过一番非常吃力的攀登，总算到达了绝顶，先经过这凌空矗立的市镇的头一排房子，接着就拖着步子走向小学校舍。时间太早，还没放学，小学生的声音嗡嗡的，有如一大群蚊子，他顺着大教堂路往回走了几步，端详着命运为他在这世界上最爱的人安排的居家所在。校舍是石头砌的，面积很大。门前有两棵高大的山毛榉，树干光洁，呈灰褐色。这类树大抵长在白垩质高地上。他看得见直棂窗里面窗台上方小学生的脑壳，黑头发、棕头发、淡黄头发都有。为了消磨时间，他就往下走到平地，这原是大教堂花园旧址。他此刻不由自主地兴奋得心直跳。 他不想在学生放学前进学校，所以一直呆在那儿；后来听见了说话的琅琅童声在空中荡漾，只见女孩们穿着红蓝两色上衣，外罩白围巾，蹦蹦跳跳地走过三个世纪前尼庵堂主、住持、副住持、女执事和三十个女尼看破世情、修真养性的地方。待他往回走时，才明白等的时间太多，在最后一个学生离校之后，苏也紧跟着到镇上去了。整个下午费乐生都不在校，到沙津开教师会。 裘德进了没人的教室，坐下来。正在扫地的姑娘告诉他费乐生太太几分钟后就回来。离他不远地方有架钢琴——其实就是费乐生当年在马利格林买的旧钢琴，虽然到了下午这时已经昏暗，看不大清楚键，裘德还是乍着胆子试弹了弹，忍不住转奏起上礼拜那么感动他的那首赞美诗来。 一个人影在他身后晃动，他原以为是那个拿笤帚的姑娘，也就没注意，后来那个人走近了，把她的手轻轻放在他按低音键的手上。这压上来的手小小的，似曾相识，于是他转过身来。 “往下弹吧。”苏说。“我喜欢它。我在麦尔切斯特那阵子，学过这个曲子。进修学校的人时常弹它。” “我可不能在你面前献丑啊！还是你给我弹吧。” “哦，呢——这我倒不在乎。” 苏坐下来，她对这个曲子的表现，固然算不上出色，但同裘德弹奏的效果一比，却显得气度庄严。她也跟他一样，显而易见因旧曲重弹而感动——在她自己反而觉得意外。她刚弹完，裘德就把手向她的手伸过去，才伸到一半地方，就跟她过来接的手碰到一块儿。裘德把她的手握紧，像她婚前那样。 “这可怪啦，”她说，声音完全变了，“我居然喜欢起那个情调啦；因为——” “因为什么？” “因为我不是那类人——绝对不是啊。” “是说不轻易感动吗？” “我不完全是那个意思。” “哦，不过你就是那类人，因为你的心灵的感受同我一样啊！” “不过头脑的活动并不一样。” 苏又往下弹，突然转过身来。由于意想不到的冲动，他们再次握起手来。 她把他的手很快放开了，低声地笑出来，不过显出抑制。“多可笑！”她说。“我真搞不清咱们干吗这样。” “我想这是因为咱们是一个模子出来的，我以前就说过。” “咱们的思想可不是一个模子。或许情感方面有那么点。” “不过情感支配思想啊。哪个想得到，给这首赞美诗谱曲的，居然是我碰到的顶俗鄙的人，这难道不亵渎神明吗！” “怎么——你认识他？” “我去找过他。” “哎，你这个呆鹅——这样的事，只有我才干得出来！你干吗这么干呢？” “因为咱们俩不一样嘛！”他冷冷地说。 “好啦，咱们该喝点茶啦。”苏说。“咱们不必到我家去，就在这儿喝好不好？把水壶跟茶具拿过来也不费事。我们没住在学校，住在路对面那个又老又旧的房子里，名字叫葛庐。它真是老掉了牙，又那么阴凄凄的，弄得心情坏透了。那样的房子要是参观参观还不错，住人可不行——从前住过多少辈的人，我觉得他们加起来的分量把我给压到地底下去啦。在学校这类新地方住，只要你自个儿的生命撑得住就行。坐下吧，我叫阿代把茶具拿过来。” 他坐在火炉的亮光中等着，她出去之前就把炉门拉开了。女仆拿着茶具随着她回来，于是他们都坐在同样的炉光中。放在炉架上的铜壶底下的酒精灯发出的蓝色火苗，使炉光的亮度增加了。 “你送给我的结婚礼物，这是其中之一。”她说，指着铜壶。 他当做礼物的铜壶现在唱出来的调子使他感到有点讽刺意味；他想换个话题，就说，“你知道不知道《新约》各篇之外，还有什么杂出的好版本值得读读？我想你在学校时候，不看这类书吧？” “哦，才不会看呢——不然就把方近左右的人全惊动啦。有倒是有一本。我以前那位朋友在世的时候，我对它挺感兴趣，这会儿对它的内容已经不甚了了。就是考伯那部《经外福音大全》。” “这倒像我要的东西。”他尽管这么说，可是“从前那位朋友”这个说法让他觉得刺心。他知道她说的是她从前那位大学生同志。他不禁揣摩她究竟跟费乐生说没说过这件事。 “妮柯得摩福音》挺有意思。”她接下去说，想把他的嫉妒心岔开，因为她对他这种心理看得很清楚，而且一向看得很清楚。在他们谈着与他们本身无关的闲话的同时，他们的感情却正在进行另一番无声的谈话，两心交融，完美谐和。“这是本足以乱真的著作。全书也分列章节，注意节奏韵律，所以这本书跟福音派教徒念的别的福音书没什么两样。你就像在梦里念着，说是念一样东西吧，可又不完全一样。裘德，难道你对那类问题还有兴趣吗？你不是正精读《为我一生而辩》？” “不错，我还在念神学书，比以前更用功。” 她看着他，显出好奇的意思。 “你干吗这么瞧着我？”裘德说。 “哦——你干吗要知道？” “我敢说你在这方面一定能告诉我至今我大概一无所知的道理。你从那位故世的亲密朋友那儿大概什么都学到了！” “咱们别没完没了谈这个啦！”她想用委婉的口气功住他。‘你下礼拜还上那个教堂吗？还到你学那首好听的赞美诗的地方去吗？” “还要去，大概是这样。” “那太好啦。我上那儿去看你好不好？按这么个方向走没错儿吧，随便我哪个下午坐半个钟头火车去都成吧？” “不成。你别来。” “怎么啦——咱们以后不交朋友啦？不像咱们以前那样啦？” “不像以前那样啦。” “我倒还不知道呢。我老想着你对我的心总那么好啊！” “我这会儿不那样啦。” “那我到底有什么错处呀？我敢说我心里老念叨着咱们俩——”她说话中间的颤音，把她的话打断了。 “苏，我有时候当你是卖弄风情的女人。”他突如其来地说。 一刹那停顿，跟着她忽地蹦起来。他借着酒精灯光看见她脸涨得通红，不禁吓了一跳。 “我不能再跟你说下去啦，裘德！”她说，饱含着从前就有的悲怆的女低音。“弹了那样病态的耶稣受难日的曲子，叫人觉着做了不妥当的事，天又黑透了，咱们怎么还这样呆在一块儿呢！……咱们不好再这么坐着谈下去啦！哎——你得走啦，因为你错看了我啦！你话说得那么绝情，可是我这人跟你说的是南辕北辙啊——哦，裘德呀，说那样的话真是太绝情啦！可是我也不便把实情一五一十说给你听——要是我告诉你我一切怎么听凭冲动支配，我多么深切感到如果天生丽质不能颠倒众生，那就不必来到世上，一定叫你震惊。有些女人并不因为有人爱她，她的爱情就此满足了；这样一来，常常是她爱上了人，她的爱情也还是得不到满足。结果是，她们可能发现自己对那承主教大人之命而为一家之主的人没法继续爱下去。不过，裘德，你是这么直心眼儿，你没法一下子就懂我的意思！好啦，你该走啦。我丈夫没在家，我觉着这样说不过去！” “你真觉着说不过去？” “我自己有数，我这么说无非是从俗！说老实话，我可不认为什么过得去过不去的。这算得了什么，不管怎么着，一说都叫人难过。” 他们两个先前握着手的时间既然太长了点，所以他走的时候，她只碰了碰他的手指头。他刚出门，她就一副不满意的神情，往板凳上一跳，把一扇窗户的铁格子推开了，而裘德正从外面小路走过窗下。“裘德，你什么时候离开这儿赶火车？” 他往上一瞧，吃了一惊。“大概还有三刻钟吧，公共马车才去迎火车。” “那你这段时间怎么消磨呢？” “哦——我看随便转转就行啦。大概到老教堂坐坐吧。” “我就这么把你打发走了，未免太狠心喽！你钻教堂该钻腻啦，天哪，别再摸黑进教堂吧。就呆在这儿吧。” “哪儿呀？” “你这会儿呆的地方呀。这么着，我跟你说话，可以比你在学校里头自在啦。你耽误半天来看我，你待我心多好多细啊！亲爱的裘德，你就是老做梦的约瑟啊。是一生悲剧的堂·吉河德啊。你有时候就是圣·司提反，别人拿石头砸他的时候，他还能看得见天国的门打开哪。哦，我的可怜的朋友和同志，你的苦还在后头呢！” 高高的窗台既然把他们隔开了，他也就无从接近她，看来她不再像在近处相处那么拘谨，而是坦然无忌，似想把衷曲一吐为快。“我一直想着，”她接着说，话里充满感情，“文明把咱们硬塞进它设定的社会模子里，可咱们的实际形象跟模子毫不相干，这道理就像咱们常见的满天星斗，它们的样子不等于星座的真正的形状。人家管我叫里查·费乐生太太，我跟叫那个名字的对方在一块儿过平静的夫妇生活。可是我根本不是什么里查·费乐生太太，而是一个不然一身，让人摆弄、调教的女人。既是情欲为正理所不容，嫌忌又有口难明……现在你别再等啦，要不然你就误了公共马车啦。你再来看我吧。你一定再来看我啊，到时候你要到家里来。” “好，好！”裘德说，“什么时候呢？” “从明天算，就过一个礼拜好啦。再见——再见！”她把手伸出来，带着怜爱之情抚摸他的前额——只摸了一下。裘德说过再会，就走进沉沉黑夜。 他沿比波街走着，听见了公共马车的轮声，等他赶到集市广场的公爵别业，公共马车果然已经出发了。要想靠步行及时赶到火车站是办不到的，他只好随遇而安，等下一趟公共马车——那是往麦尔切斯特的最后一班。 他随便转悠了一会儿，弄了点东西吃。当时还剩下半个钟头闲着没事，没想到身不由己竟然径直穿过历史悠久的三一教堂的墓地和它的菩提树夹道的林荫路，又朝学校方向去了。学校漆黑一片。她说住在葛庐老宅，按她形容的古旧风貌，他很快找到了那所房子。 一道闪烁的烛光从前窗射出来，百叶窗还没关上。屋内情景看得清清楚楚——地面要比房子外面的道路低两个台阶，这是因为房子造好后又过了几百年，路已经填高许多。显而易见，苏刚进屋子，戴着帽子，还没卸装。她站在房子前部小会客室或起坐室里，墙壁四周，从地上到天花板，镶满了橡木壁板，预制好的粗壮的横梁承接着天花板，只比她的头略高些。壁炉台板也是同样结实厚重的款式，刻着詹姆士一世时代的方柱和经卷。毫不含糊，几个世纪沉重地悬在年轻妻子头上，而她就在那儿消磨光阴。 她打开一个花梨木针线盒，看着一张照片。全神贯注了一会儿，就把它贴在胸前，随后又放回原处。 这时她才想到窗户还没挡好，就手持蜡烛，移步窗前做这件事。天太黑了，她看不见外边的裘德，但是他却把她的脸看得一清二楚，她那双长长睫毛覆着的黑眼睛分明珠泪盈眶，一点也没看错。 她关上了百叶窗。裘德转身离开，独自寂寂走上归途。“她看的照片是谁的？”他说。他有一回把自己的照片给了她；不过她也有别人的呀。不过那准是他的照片，错不了吧？ 他深知必得按她的嘱咐去看她。他所研读的真诚不苟的学问大家，那些圣贤人物，也就是苏曾以轻松的调侃形容为高于人的次神，要是缺乏对自身力量的自信的话，准会回避这样的接触。但是他办不到。他自然可以在见不到苏的那段时间禁食、祈祷，克抑欲念，无奈他身上的人性终究比身外的神力更强大啊。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/292/7807.html","bookId":190,"book":{"id":190,"title":"无名的裘德
