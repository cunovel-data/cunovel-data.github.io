{"id":5944,"no":53,"title":"Part 6 Chapter 5","content":"THE next afternoon the familiar Christminster fog still hung over all things. Sue\u0027s slim shape was only just discernible going towards the station. Jude had no heart to go to his work that day. Neither could he go anywhere in the direction by which she would be likely to pass. He went in an opposite one, to a dreary, strange, flat scene, where boughs dripped, and coughs and consumption lurked, and where he had never been before. \"Sue\u0027s gone from me--gone!\" he murmured miserably. She in the meantime had left by the train, and reached Alfredston Road, where she entered the steam-tram and was conveyed into the town. It had been her request to Phillotson that he should not meet her. She wished, she said, to come to him voluntarily, to his very house and hearthstone. It was Friday evening, which had been chosen because the schoolmaster was disengaged at four o\u0027clock that day till the Monday morning following. The little car she hired at the Bear to drive her to Marygreen set her down at the end of the lane, half a mile from the village, by her desire, and preceded her to the schoolhouse with such portion of her luggage as she had brought. On its return she encountered it, and asked the driver if he had found the master\u0027s house open. The man informed her that he had, and that her things had been taken in by the schoolmaster himself. She could now enter Marygreen without exciting much observation. She crossed by the well and under the trees to the pretty new school on the other side, and lifted the latch of the dwelling without knocking. Phillotson stood in the middle of the room, awaiting her, as requested. \"I\u0027ve come, Richard,\" said she, looking pale and shaken, and sinking into a chair. \"I cannot believe--you forgive your--wife!\" \"Everything, darling Susanna,\" said Phillotson. She started at the endearment, though it had been spoken advisedly without fervour. Then she nerved herself again. \"My children--are dead--and it is right that they should be! I am glad--almost. They were sin-begotten. They were sacrificed to teach me how to live! Their death was the first stage of my purification. That\u0027s why they have not died in vain! ... You will take me back?\" He was so stirred by her pitiful words and tone that he did more than he had meant to do. He bent and kissed her cheek. Sue imperceptibly shrank away, her flesh quivering under the touch of his lips. Phillotson\u0027s heart sank, for desire was renascent in him. \"You still have an aversion to me!\" \"Oh no, dear--I have been driving through the damp, and I was chilly!\" she said, with a hurried smile of apprehension. \"When are we going to have the marriage? Soon?\" \"To-morrow morning, early, I thought--if you really wish. I am sending round to the vicar to let him know you are come. I have told him all, and he highly approves--he says it will bring our lives to a triumphant and satisfactory issue. But--are you sure of yourself? It is not too late to refuse now if-- you think you can\u0027t bring yourself to it, you know?\" \"Yes, yes, I can! I want it done quick. Tell him, tell him at once! My strength is tried by the undertaking--I can\u0027t wait long!\" \"Have something to eat and drink then, and go over to your room at Mrs. Edlin\u0027s. I\u0027ll tell the vicar half-past eight to-morrow, before anybody is about--if that\u0027s not too soon for you? My friend Gillingham is here to help us in the ceremony. He\u0027s been good enough to come all the way from Shaston at great inconvenience to himself.\" Unlike a woman in ordinary, whose eye is so keen for material things, Sue seemed to see nothing of the room they were in, or any detail of her environment. But on moving across the parlour to put down her muff she uttered a little \"Oh!\" and grew paler than before. Her look was that of the condemned criminal who catches sight of his coffin. \"What?\" said Phillotson. The flap of the bureau chanced to be open, and in placing her muff upon it her eye had caught a document which lay there. \"Oh--only a--funny surprise!\" she said, trying to laugh away her cry as she came back to the table. \"Ah! Yes,\" said Phillotson. \"The licence.... It has just come.\" Gillingham now joined them from his room above, and Sue nervously made herself agreeable to him by talking on whatever she thought likely to interest him, except herself, though that interested him most of all. She obediently ate some supper, and prepared to leave for her lodging hard by. Phillotson crossed the green with her, bidding her good-night at Mrs. Edlin\u0027s door. The old woman accompanied Sue to her temporary quarters, and helped her to unpack. Among other things she laid out a night-gown tastefully embroidered. \"Oh--I didn\u0027t know THAT was put in!\" said Sue quickly. \"I didn\u0027t mean it to be. Here is a different one.\" She handed a new and absolutely plain garment, of coarse and unbleached calico. \"But this is the prettiest,\" said Mrs. Edlin. \"That one is no better than very sackcloth o\u0027 Scripture!\" \"Yes--I meant it to be. Give me the other.\" She took it, and began rending it with all her might, the tears resounding through the house like a screech-owl. \"But my dear, dear!--whatever ...\" \"It is adulterous! It signifies what I don\u0027t feel--I bought it long ago-- to please Jude. It must be destroyed!\" Mrs. Edlin lifted her hands, and Sue excitedly continued to tear the linen into strips, laying the pieces in the fire. \"You med ha\u0027 give it to me!\" said the widow. \"It do make my heart ache to see such pretty open-work as that a-burned by the flames-- not that ornamental night-rails can be much use to a\u0027 ould \u0027ooman like I. My days for such be all past and gone!\" \"It is an accursed thing--it reminds me of what I want to forget!\" Sue repeated. \"It is only fit for the fire.\" \"Lord, you be too strict! What do ye use such words for, and condemn to hell your dear little innocent children that\u0027s lost to \u0027ee! Upon my life I don\u0027t call that religion!\" Sue flung her face upon the bed, sobbing. \"Oh, don\u0027t, don\u0027t! That kills me!\" She remained shaken with her grief, and slipped down upon her knees. \"I\u0027ll tell \u0027ee what--you ought not to marry this man again!\" said Mrs. Edlin indignantly. \"You are in love wi\u0027 t\u0027 other still!\" \"Yes I must--I am his already!\" \"Pshoo! You be t\u0027 other man\u0027s. If you didn\u0027t like to commit yourselves to the binding vow again, just at first, \u0027twas all the more credit to your consciences, considering your reasons, and you med ha\u0027 lived on, and made it all right at last. After all, it concerned nobody but your own two selves.\" \"Richard says he\u0027ll have me back, and I\u0027m bound to go! If he had refused, it might not have been so much my duty to-- give up Jude. But--\" She remained with her face in the bed-clothes, and Mrs. Edlin left the room. Phillotson in the interval had gone back to his friend Gillingham, who still sat over the supper-table. They soon rose, and walked out on the green to smoke awhile. A light was burning in Sue\u0027s room, a shadow moving now and then across the blind. Gillingham had evidently been impressed with the indefinable charm of Sue, and after a silence he said, \"Well: you\u0027ve all but got her again at last. She can\u0027t very well go a second time. The pear has dropped into your hand.\" \"Yes! ... I suppose I am right in taking her at her word. I confess there seems a touch of selfishness in it. Apart from her being what she is, of course, a luxury for a fogy like me, it will set me right in the eyes of the clergy and orthodox laity, who have never forgiven me for letting her go. So I may get back in some degree into my old track.\" \"Well--if you\u0027ve got any sound reason for marrying her again, do it now in God\u0027s name! I was always against your opening the cage-door and letting the bird go in such an obviously suicidal way. You might have been a school inspector by this time, or a reverend, if you hadn\u0027t been so weak about her.\" \"I did myself irreparable damage--I know it.\" \"Once you\u0027ve got her housed again, stick to her.\" Phillotson was more evasive to-night. He did not care to admit clearly that his taking Sue to him again had at bottom nothing to do with repentance of letting her go, but was, primarily, a human instinct flying in the face of custom and profession. He said, \"Yes--I shall do that. I know woman better now. Whatever justice there was in releasing her, there was little logic, for one holding my views on other subjects.\" Gillingham looked at him, and wondered whether it would ever happen that the reactionary spirit induced by the world\u0027s sneers and his own physical wishes would make Phillotson more orthodoxly cruel to her than he had erstwhile been informally and perversely kind. \"I perceive it won\u0027t do to give way to impulse,\" Phillotson resumed, feeling more and more every minute the necessity of acting up to his position. \"I flew in the face of the Church\u0027s teaching; but I did it without malice prepense. Women are so strange in their influence that they tempt you to misplaced kindness. However, I know myself better now. A little judicious severity, perhaps....\" \"Yes; but you must tighten the reins by degrees only. Don\u0027t be too strenuous at first. She\u0027ll come to any terms in time.\" The caution was unnecessary, though Phillotson did not say so. \"I remember what my vicar at Shaston said, when I left after the row that was made about my agreeing to her elopement. \u0027The only thing you can do to retrieve your position and hers is to admit your error in not restraining her with a wise and strong hand, and to get her back again if she\u0027ll come, and be firm in the future.\u0027 But I was so headstrong at that time that I paid no heed. And that after the divorce she should have thought of doing so I did not dream.\" The gate of Mrs. Edlin\u0027s cottage clicked, and somebody began crossing in the direction of the school. Phillotson said \"Good-night.\" \"Oh, is that Mr. Phillotson,\" said Mrs. Edlin. \"I was going over to see \u0027ee. I\u0027ve been upstairs with her, helping her to unpack her things; and upon my word, sir, I don\u0027t think this ought to be!\" \"What--the wedding?\" \"Yes. She\u0027s forcing herself to it, poor dear little thing; and you\u0027ve no notion what she\u0027s suffering. I was never much for religion nor against it, but it can\u0027t be right to let her do this, and you ought to persuade her out of it. Of course everybody will say it was very good and forgiving of \u0027ee to take her to \u0027ee again. But for my part I don\u0027t.\" \"It\u0027s her wish, and I am willing,\" said Phillotson with grave reserve, opposition making him illogically tenacious now. \"A great piece of laxity will be rectified.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it. She\u0027s his wife if anybody\u0027s. She\u0027s had three children by him, and he loves her dearly; and it\u0027s a wicked shame to egg her on to this, poor little quivering thing! She\u0027s got nobody on her side. The one man who\u0027d be her friend the obstinate creature won\u0027t allow to come near her. What first put her into this mood o\u0027 mind, I wonder!\" \"I can\u0027t tell. Not I certainly. It is all voluntary on her part. Now that\u0027s all I have to say.\" Phillotson spoke stiffly. \"You\u0027ve turned round, Mrs. Edlin. It is unseemly of you!\" \"Well. I knowed you\u0027d be affronted at what I had to say; but I don\u0027t mind that. The truth\u0027s the truth.\" \"I\u0027m not affronted, Mrs. Edlin. You\u0027ve been too kind a neighbour for that. But I must be allowed to know what\u0027s best for myself and Susanna. I suppose you won\u0027t go to church with us, then?\" \"No. Be hanged if I can.... I don\u0027t know what the times be coming to! Matrimony have growed to be that serious in these days that one really do feel afeard to move in it at all. In my time we took it more careless; and I don\u0027t know that we was any the worse for it! When I and my poor man were jined in it we kept up the junketing all the week, and drunk the parish dry, and had to borrow half a crown to begin housekeeping!\" When Mrs. Edlin had gone back to her cottage Phillotson spoke moodily. \"I don\u0027t know whether I ought to do it--at any rate quite so rapidly.\" \"Why?\" \"If she is really compelling herself to this against her instincts-- merely from this new sense of duty or religion--I ought perhaps to let her wait a bit.\" \"Now you\u0027ve got so far you ought not to back out of it. That\u0027s my opinion.\" \"I can\u0027t very well put it off now; that\u0027s true. But I had a qualm when she gave that little cry at sight of the licence.\" \"Now, never you have qualms, old boy. I mean to give her away to-morrow morning, and you mean to take her. It has always been on my conscience that I didn\u0027t urge more objections to your letting her go, and now we\u0027ve got to this stage I shan\u0027t be content if I don\u0027t help you to set the matter right.\" Phillotson nodded, and seeing how staunch his friend was, became more frank. \"No doubt when it gets known what I\u0027ve done I shall be thought a soft fool by many. But they don\u0027t know Sue as I do. Though so elusive, hers is such an honest nature at bottom that I don\u0027t think she has ever done anything against her conscience. The fact of her having lived with Fawley goes for nothing. At the time she left me for him she thought she was quite within her right. Now she thinks otherwise.\" The next morning came, and the self-sacrifice of the woman on the altar of what she was pleased to call her principles was acquiesced in by these two friends, each from his own point of view. Phillotson went across to the Widow Edlin\u0027s to fetch Sue a few minutes after eight o\u0027clock. The fog of the previous day or two on the low-lands had travelled up here by now, and the trees on the green caught armfuls, and turned them into showers of big drops. The bride was waiting, ready; bonnet and all on. She had never in her life looked so much like the lily her name connoted as she did in that pallid morning light. Chastened, world-weary, remorseful, the strain on her nerves had preyed upon her flesh and bones, and she appeared smaller in outline than she had formerly done, though Sue had not been a large woman in her days of rudest health. \"Prompt,\" said the schoolmaster, magnanimously taking her hand. But he checked his impulse to kiss her, remembering her start of yesterday, which unpleasantly lingered in his mind. Gillingham joined them, and they left the house, Widow Edlin continuing steadfast in her refusal to assist in the ceremony. \"Where is the church?\" said Sue. She had not lived there for any length of time since the old church was pulled down, and in her preoccupation forgot the new one. \"Up here,\" said Phillotson; and presently the tower loomed large and solemn in the fog. The vicar had already crossed to the building, and when they entered he said pleasantly: \"We almost want candles.\" \"You do--wish me to be yours, Richard?\" gasped Sue in a whisper. \"Certainly, dear: above all things in the world.\" Sue said no more; and for the second or third time he felt he was not quite following out the humane instinct which had induced him to let her go. There they stood, five altogether: the parson, the clerk, the couple, and Gillingham; and the holy ordinance was resolemnized forthwith. In the nave of the edifice were two or three villagers, and when the clergyman came to the words, \"What God hath joined,\" a woman\u0027s voice from among these was heard to utter audibly: \"God hath jined indeed!\" It was like a re-enactment by the ghosts of their former selves of the similar scene which had taken place at Melchester years before. When the books were signed the vicar congratulated the husband and wife on having performed a noble, and righteous, and mutually forgiving act. \"All\u0027s well that ends well,\" he said smiling. \"May you long be happy together, after thus having been \u0027saved as by fire.\u0027\" They came down the nearly empty building, and crossed to the schoolhouse. Gillingham wanted to get home that night, and left early. He, too, congratulated the couple. \"Now,\" he said in parting from Phillotson, who walked out a little way, \"I shall be able to tell the people in your native place a good round tale; and they\u0027ll all say \u0027Well done,\u0027 depend on it.\" When the schoolmaster got back Sue was making a pretence of doing some housewifery as if she lived there. But she seemed timid at his approach, and compunction wrought on him at sight of it. \"Of course, my dear, I shan\u0027t expect to intrude upon your personal privacy any more than I did before,\" he said gravely. \"It is for our good socially to do this, and that\u0027s its justification, if it was not my reason.\" Sue brightened a little. 第二天下午，人们习以为常的基督堂浓雾依然笼罩着一切。苏的纤弱的身影在雾中依稀可辨。她正在往车站的路上。 裘德那天百事无心，没去上班。凡苏一路可能行经的地方他也一概不想去，故此采取了相反的方向，走到了一处前此从未到过的地方，但见物景凄迷、诡异、毫无生趣，成片的树枝不断滴水，咳嗽和肺痨随处隐藏着。 “苏把我甩啦——把我甩啦！”他悲伤地嘟嘟囔囔。 苏在同一时间已经坐火车到了阿尔夫瑞顿大路，在那儿上了汽动有轨车，转往镇内。事先她请求费乐生勿来接她。她说，此来系自愿，希望一径到他家，到他炉旁。 那是个礼拜五晚上，所以选择这个时间，是因为小学老师从那天下午四点直到礼拜一上午都没课。她在大熊客栈雇的小车把她送到马利格林，先在离村半英里远的篱路一头停住，让她先下车后再往前赶，把她带来的行李送到小学。小车掉头回来的路上跟她碰头。她问车夫老师家的门开没开着。车夫告诉她门开了，老师还亲自把她的东西搬进去。 这样她可以进入马利格林而不引得人人注目。她打井边走过去，从大树底下走到另一边看上去相当新的校舍，门也没敲就抬起门搭子进去了。费乐生果然如她嘱咐，站在屋子当中等着她。 “我来了，里查。”她说，面色苍白，身上直哆嗦，一屁股坐到了椅子上。“我真不敢信——你不计较你的——妻子啦！” “什么都不计较，亲爱的苏珊娜。”费乐生说。 他这么亲呢倒叫她一愣，不过他这是准备有素，说得有板有眼，何尝有一点点炽热的情感。跟着苏又折腾起自己来了。 “我的孩子——都死啦！——死得活该！我心里高兴——简直高兴啊。他们生下来就是罪孽。他们送了命可教我懂得了该怎么活着啦！他们一死，我就过了洗心革面第一关。所以他们并不是白死啊！……你真要我回来吗？” 她的话，她的声调那么凄楚，他不由得心里一乱，这一来做出了他本来无心的举动。他弯下腰，亲了亲她的一边脸。 她稍微一闪，不怎么看得出来，让他嘴唇一碰，浑身的肉都颤起来了。 费乐生大失所望，因为他的欲火又升起来了。“我看你还是嫌我！” “哦，不是，亲爱的——我——我是一直在湿淋淋的大雾里头坐车来的，身上冷飕飕的！”她说，出自某种担心，赶紧笑了笑。‘咱们什么时候举行婚礼呀？快了吧？” “我想好了，明天一大早，要是你也愿意的话。我要叫人给教区长送个信，说你到了。我什么都告诉他了，他非常赞成——他说这么一办，咱们以后的日子准是功德圆满，万事如意。不过——你自己是不是主意定了？你要是觉着现在还不好走这一步，现在说不行也不迟。” “行，行，我都行！我就是要快办快了。告诉他吧，马上告诉他。这件事正是考验我的力量——我等不下去啦！” “那就先吃点喝点吧，然后咱们就上艾林太太家里你那间屋子。我要通知教区长，订在明天八点半，那时候没什么人出来转悠——这样你不觉着太紧吧？我的朋友季令安要到这儿来，参加咱们的婚礼。他人实在好，不嫌路远不便，硬要从沙氏顿赶来。” 苏不像一般女人那样对物质东西极为经心，一眼不放过；她好像对他们屋子里的东西，或者对她周围的任何细微的情况，都茫茫然一无所见。但当她穿过小客厅去放下手笼时候，低低地‘哎呀！”了一声，面色比先前更苍白了。她脸上的神情犹如死刑犯见了自己的棺材。 “怎么啦？”费乐生说。 写字台的盖子正好翻起来，她放下手笼的时候一眼看见了放在那儿的文件。“哦——没什么——就是惊了一下，怪可笑的！”她说，一边回到桌子旁，一边笑出来，极力遮掩自己无意中的叫声。 “啊！对啦。”费乐生说。“结婚证。……刚拿来的。” 季令安从楼上他的房间下来，到了他们一块儿。苏神经很紧张，她尽量找些叫他感兴趣的话说，让他觉着自己随和，容易相处，就是不说她自己，而他最感兴趣的恰在她本人。她敷衍了事吃了饭，准备去自己的住处。费乐生陪她走过草地，在艾林太太门口道了晚安。 老太婆把她带到她临时下榻的屋子，帮她打开行李。她拿出来的东西中间，有一件是绣花睡衣，绣工精美。 “哎呀——这东西也放在里头啦，我怎么不知道呀！”她急急地说。“我本来不要它啦。这儿还有一件哪，不一样。”她递给艾林太太一件非常朴素的新睡衣，料子是本色白粗布。 “可那件真漂亮极啦。”艾林太太说。“这件比《圣经》里说的粗布好不到哪儿！” “我就是想要这件。把那件给我。”她接过来，浑身使劲，把睡衣撕开了，只撕得吱吱响，活像尖枭预报出了祸事的声音。 “可是我的亲爱的，亲爱的！——无论怎么着……” “这件衣裳是通奸用的！我可没想到，倒叫它说出来了——是我老早以前买的，专为让裘德高兴的。一定得把它撕烂了！” 艾林太太把双手举起来。苏激动不已，继续撕，把亚麻睡衣撕成一条条的，然后把碎片一齐扔到火里。 “你不是可以给我嘛！”寡妇说。“做得这么精这么细的活儿，一下子甩到火里烧了，大叫人心疼啦——倒不是这花花绿绿的睡衣，我老太婆这把年纪还有什么用。我穿这样东西的日子早过去啦。” “这东西真该死——它叫我想起来我要忘的事！”她重复了一遍。“就是该放在火里烧了。” “天哪，你严刻得过头啦！你说这些话干吗？你这是咒你没罪死了的亲爱的小宝贝儿，叫他们下地狱！唉，你这一套，我可决不能说你信教！” 她一下子把脸扑在床上，呜呜哭起来。“别说啦，别说啦！要叫我死啦！”她因为痛心而继续哆嗦着，一滑就跪到地板上了。 “我要跟你讲明白——你决不能再跟这个男的结婚！”艾林太太气愤地说。“你直到这会儿爱的还是另一个男的！” “我一定跟他结婚——我早就是他的人啦！” “屁！你是另外那个男人的。要是你们俩当初就不愿意照头一回那样让誓言捆住，按你们的道理，凭你们自个儿良心，可以好好过下去，日久天长什么都顺顺当当啦。说到底，这是你们俩的事，谁都管不了。” “里查说要我回来，我只好回来啦！要是他不要我，我何必担这么大不是——把裘德甩了呢。不过——”她脸还伏在床单上，而艾林太太却离开了她的屋子。 费乐生这时候又回到他的朋友季令安那儿，原来他坐在晚饭桌边没动过。稍后他们站起来，走到外面草地上，抽了会儿烟。只见苏屋里有了灯光，一个人影有时在窗帘上来回移动。 季令安显然对苏那难以描述的丰姿深为心折，他们沉默一会儿后，他说，“呃，你现在总算又把她弄回来了。她总不能故伎重演吧。梨子算掉到你手心里啦。” “对！……我看我拿她的话当话，一点儿没错。我承认，这里头似乎有那么点自私自利味道。先不说她这个人对我这样的老古板毫无疑问是个无价之宝；这件事，就是在教会人眼里头，在那些卫道的俗人眼里头，我这人也是又归了正道了，他们就是为我让苏走了，始终不饶我。如今这么一来，我多多少少可以旧调重弹吧。” “咂——要是你的确有了站得住的理由跟她结婚，那你现在就光明正大地办好啦。我从前一直不赞成你开了笼门把鸟儿放走，这明明是把你自己坑到底的办法。你当初要不是那么软，恐怕你这会儿就已经是督学了，也许还担任了圣职呢。” “我给自己造成的损失，的确是无法弥补的——这我心里有数。” “你一把她弄回来住，就一定得盯牢她。” 费乐生那晚上说起话来不免闪烁其词。他不愿意明白表示他之所以把苏又弄回来，根本同他后悔当初放走她这一点无关，而主要是出自他不甘向习俗和同道示弱的那种人类具有的反抗本能。他说，“是——我一定要做到。现在我比从前懂得女人了。从前放走她不论多合乎公道，但是要拿我这个人在别的事情上的观点一比，那就完全不合逻辑了。” 季令安瞧着他，琢磨着世人对他费乐生的冷嘲热讽和他自身的生理要求会不会诱发他的逆反心理，使他一反从前对她的姑息放纵，而置礼法于度外，竟然变得以卫道为名而对她横施暴虐。 “我看单靠冲动办事是行不通的。”费乐生又把话接下去。随着每分钟过去，他越来越感到他此后一言一行非得符合自己的身份不可。“我从前不肯听教会的训示，不过我那样不是蓄意对教会伤害。女人的影响真是怪极了，她们一诱惑了你，你就把仁爱之心滥用起来了。不过我现在比以前有点自知之明啦。稍微厉害那么一点，而又通情达理，也许……” “对啊；不过你总得一步一步把缰绳勒紧才行。开头别搞得太猛。到时候，随你干什么，她就都乖乖听话了。” 这番告诫大可不必，不过费乐生当时没这么表示就是了。“我还没忘，我答应她私奔之后，人家把我轰走了，沙氏顿那位教区长说的话：‘你要想恢复你跟她的身份，你只有一件事好做，就是承认你错在出手不灵不硬，没管住她；要是再把她弄回来，假定她会回来，那从今而后你就得主意拿定不动摇。’不过我当时意气用事，那些话，我当成了耳旁风。再说我做梦也没想到她离婚之后居然还想到要回来。” 艾林太太的街门卡嗒响了一声。正好有个人从学校那边过来。费乐生说了声“晚安”。 “哟，费乐生先生哪。”艾林太太说。“我正要过去瞧瞧你。我一直在楼上跟她一块儿，帮她开箱子拣东西呢。说实在的，先生，我看这事儿办不得呀！ “什么事——婚礼吗？” “对啦。她这是硬逼着自个儿呀，可怜的小东西啊；她受了多少罪，你心里可没点影子哟。我向来不信教，我也不反教，可让她干这事儿，那就是不对，你应该劝她别这么着。当然人人都要说你心眼儿好，饶了她，把她又弄回来。我可不这么看。” “这是她心里想，我也愿意。”费乐生说，极力克制自己，因为别人一反对，他更固执到不讲理的程度。“从前稀里糊涂地错了，这以后就要改过来了。” “我才不信呢。要讲她是什么人的老婆，她就是他的老婆。她跟他生了三个娃儿，他爱她爱得才厉害呢；挑唆她干这事，那是太不要脸啦，那个哆嗦得没完没了的小东西可怜哪！她旁边可没一个人跟她商量呀。那个男的是她的朋友，可这个拧脾气的丫头就是不许他沾边。我纳闷，究竟什么东西头一个闹得她有这样个瞎想头。” “这我说不上来。反正不是我。她这完全是自愿。我该说的现在都说了。”费乐生生硬地说。“你这是大转弯啦，艾林太太。你这可不够交情！” “呃，我知道我一说该说的话，就把你得罪啦，我可不在乎。实话实说，硬碰硬的。” “我可没觉着你得罪我，艾林太太。对这样的事儿，你做邻居的心太好啦。可是得由我自己做主，我知道怎么办对我自己、对苏顶好。我看，照这样，你不跟我们一块儿上教堂吧？” “不去啦。就勒死我，我也不去。……我不知道这年月是怎么回事儿！结婚这阵子都成了那么了不起的大事啦，真叫人害怕，不敢结啦。我那时候，我们才不当回事呢；我看不出来我们那阵子比这会儿坏到哪儿！我跟我可怜的那口子到了一块儿，吃吃逛逛，足足一个礼拜，连教堂里的酒都喝光了，只好借了半个克朗才揭开锅！” 艾林太太回她小房子那一刻，费乐生闷闷不乐地说，“我也不知道该办不该办——无论如何，总是太快了吧。” “这怎么说？” “要是她真违反了本心，就为了她的本分和对宗教的新感受，强逼着自己这么着，我应该让她等等才对。” “这会儿你这么走过来了，就不好往回退了。我是这么想的。” “我现在也的确不好把它往后拖了，这也是真情。不过她一看见结婚证，就叫出来，声音一丁点，我可是心里直嘀咕。” “老家伙，你这就别嘀咕啦。我打的主意是明儿早上给她主婚，把人交给你，你打的主意是把她带走，成了亲，这不就行了嘛。我当初没死说活说劝你留住她，我良心上老觉着过意不去，到了这个节骨眼儿，我要是不帮你把事情理顺了，我赶明儿个心里还会不舒服呢。” 费乐生点点头，一看他的朋友那么心直口快，他也就比较坦率了。“毫无疑问，我所作所为，别人一知道了，少不了好些人把我当个没骨头的糊涂蛋。不过他们并不像我了解苏。苏这人虽说实在不好捉摸，可是她打心眼里天生诚实无欺，我认为她压根儿没于过什么违背良心的事。她跟福来一块儿过的事，现在一风吹了。当初她离开我，去就他，她认为这全是她自己权利范围里的事。现在她想的完全反过来了。” 第二天早晨到了，两位朋友从各自角度出发，都默然承认她该上那个她称之为原则的祭坛，作为女人活该当供品。八点几分，费乐生到艾林太太家接苏。前两天在低地上弥漫的雾气现在已往上飘浮到这边来了，草地上的树木水汽盈抱，随又如阵雨般大滴洒落。新娘在屋里等着，一切就绪，穿戴得齐齐整整。她名苏珊娜，可是她这辈子还没有过像那天在早晨青白光色中那样，名副其实地堪称百合花。她因精神饱受折磨，因对人生感到厌倦，再加上神经恒常处于紧张状态，这就损伤了她的体质，她整个体态比从前显得瘦小了，虽然她体气健旺时候本也不是大块头女子。 “万事俱备啦。”小学老师说，同时意态宽宏地拉起她的手。不过他把自己想吻她的冲动克制住了，因为他没忘记昨天她失神的样子，那不快的一幕仍然留在他心头。 季令安也到了，他们离开了那座房子。艾林寡妇还是毫不通融，拒绝参加他们的婚礼。 “教堂在哪儿？”苏说。自从老教堂拆了，苏没在那个地方住多长，这会儿她满腔心事，想不起来还有新教堂。 “就在前边。”费乐生说；霎时间，只见塔楼在雾中浮现，高大庄严。教区长已经到了教堂，他们一进门，他就喜气洋洋地说：“咱们大概要点上蜡烛呢。” “你真——真要我成你的人吗，里查？”苏有点透不气来，小声说。 “这还有得说嘛，亲爱的；普天之下我唯爱你。” 她没再说什么，而他却第二次或者第三次感到他这会儿办的事丝毫也不符合当初促使他放走她的那种合乎人道的本能。 他们都站在那儿，一共五个：牧师、办事员、新人和季令安；神圣的仪式再次庄严地举行了。教堂中段有两三个村里人，在教区长说到“上帝为尔玉成”的时候，其中一个女的说了话，声音听得清清楚楚： “上帝才没玉成呢！” 一切光景宛如他们的魂灵把多年前在麦尔切斯特那回仪式重新搬演了一遍。他们在册子上签了名之后，教区长为他们这样高尚、正直的互谅互恕的举动，向他们祝贺，“结局好就什么都好，”他笑着说，“你们这样‘从火里经过而得救’，谨祝你们百年好合，白头偕老。” 他们从差不多没人的教堂出来，径直向学校走去。季令安要在当天晚上之前到家，所以提早走了。他也向他们表示祝贺。“现在，”他由费乐生陪着走了一段路，到分手时候说，“我就好给你老家的人讲一段破镜重圆的好故事啦；他们准会说‘棒极啦’，你信我好啦。” 老师回到家里，苏装着干家务事，仿佛她一直就住在那儿，可是他一走过来，她就露出来有点发怵；他看得出来，心里很不是滋味。 “我的亲爱的，我不会再跟从前一样打扰你私生活，叫你不得安宁，一定这样。”他郑重其事地说。“咱们彰明较著地办这件事，全是为咱们自己在社会上好办，就不说我完全是为这个吧，这总算是个根据啊。”
