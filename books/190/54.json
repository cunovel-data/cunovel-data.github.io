{"id":5945,"no":54,"title":"Part 6 Chapter 6","content":"THE place was the door of Jude\u0027s lodging in the out-skirts of Christminster--far from the precincts of St. Silas\u0027 where he had formerly lived, which saddened him to sickness. The rain was coming down. A woman in shabby black stood on the doorstep talking to Jude, who held the door in his hand. \"I am lonely, destitute, and houseless--that\u0027s what I am! Father has turned me out of doors after borrowing every penny I\u0027d got, to put it into his business, and then accusing me of laziness when I was only waiting for a situation. I am at the mercy of the world! If you can\u0027t take me and help me, Jude, I must go to the workhouse, or to something worse. Only just now two undergraduates winked at me as I came along. \u0027Tis hard for a woman to keep virtuous where there\u0027s so many young men!\" The woman in the rain who spoke thus was Arabella, the evening being that of the day after Sue\u0027s remarriage with Phillotson. \"I am sorry for you, but I am only in lodgings,\" said Jude coldly. \"Then you turn me away?\" \"I\u0027ll give you enough to get food and lodging for a few days.\" \"Oh, but can\u0027t you have the kindness to take me in? I cannot endure going to a public house to lodge; and I am so lonely. Please, Jude, for old times\u0027 sake!\" \"No, no,\" said Jude hastily. \"I don\u0027t want to be reminded of those things; and if you talk about them I shall not help you.\" \"Then I suppose I must go!\" said Arabella. She bent her head against the doorpost and began sobbing. \"The house is full,\" said Jude. \"And I have only a little extra room to my own--not much more than a closet--where I keep my tools, and templates, and the few books I have left!\" \"That would be a palace for me!\" \"There is no bedstead in it.\" \"A bit of a bed could be made on the floor. It would be good enough for me.\" Unable to be harsh with her, and not knowing what to do, Jude called the man who let the lodgings, and said this was an acquaintance of his in great distress for want of temporary shelter. \"You may remember me as barmaid at the Lamb and Flag formerly?\" spoke up Arabella. \"My father has insulted me this afternoon, and I\u0027ve left him, though without a penny!\" The householder said he could not recall her features. \"But still, if you are a friend of Mr. Fawley\u0027s we\u0027ll do what we can for a day or two--if he\u0027ll make himself answerable?\" \"Yes, yes,\" said Jude. \"She has really taken me quite unawares; but I should wish to help her out of her difficulty.\" And an arrangement was ultimately come to under which a bed was to be thrown down in Jude\u0027s lumber-room, to make it comfortable for Arabella till she could get out of the strait she was in-- not by her own fault, as she declared--and return to her father\u0027s again. While they were waiting for this to be done Arabella said: \"You know the news, I suppose?\" \"I guess what you mean; but I know nothing.\" \"I had a letter from Anny at Alfredston to-day. She had just heard that the wedding was to be yesterday: but she didn\u0027t know if it had come off.\" \"I don\u0027t wish to talk of it.\" \"No, no: of course you don\u0027t. Only it shows what kind of woman----\" \"Don\u0027t speak of her I say! She\u0027s a fool! And she\u0027s an angel, too, poor dear!\" \"If it\u0027s done, he\u0027ll have a chance of getting back to his old position, by everybody\u0027s account, so Anny says. All his well-wishers will be pleased, including the bishop himself.\" \"Do spare me, Arabella.\" Arabella was duly installed in the little attic, and at first she did not come near Jude at all. She went to and fro about her own business, which, when they met for a moment on the stairs or in the passage, she informed him was that of obtaining another place in the occupation she understood best. When Jude suggested London as affording the most likely opening in the liquor trade, she shook her head. \"No--the temptations are too many,\" she said. \"Any humble tavern in the country before that for me.\" On the Sunday morning following, when he breakfasted later than on other days, she meekly asked him if she might come in to breakfast with him, as she had broken her teapot, and could not replace it immediately, the shops being shut. \"Yes, if you like,\" he said indifferently. While they sat without speaking she suddenly observed: \"You seem all in a brood, old man. I\u0027m sorry for you.\" \"I am all in a brood.\" \"It is about her, I know. It\u0027s no business of mine, but I could find out all about the wedding--if it really did take place-- if you wanted to know.\" \"How could you?\" \"I wanted to go to Alfredston to get a few things I left there. And I could see Anny, who\u0027ll be sure to have heard all about it, as she has friends at Marygreen.\" Jude could not bear to acquiesce in this proposal; but his suspense pitted itself against his discretion, and won in the struggle. \"You can ask about it if you like,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve not heard a sound from there. It must have been very private, if--they have married.\" \"I am afraid I haven\u0027t enough cash to take me there and back, or I should have gone before. I must wait till I have earned some.\" \"Oh--I can pay the journey for you,\" he said impatiently. And thus his suspense as to Sue\u0027s welfare, and the possible marriage, moved him to dispatch for intelligence the last emissary he would have thought of choosing deliberately. Arabella went, Jude requesting her to be home not later than by the seven o\u0027clock train. When she had gone he said: \"Why should I have charged her to be back by a particular time! She\u0027s nothing to me--nor the other neither!\" But having finished work he could not help going to the station to meet Arabella, dragged thither by feverish haste to get the news she might bring, and know the worst. Arabella had made dimples most successfully all the way home, and when she stepped out of the railway carriage she smiled. He merely said \"Well?\" with the very reverse of a smile. \"They are married.\" \"Yes--of course they are!\" he returned. She observed, however, the hard strain upon his lip as he spoke. \"Anny says she has heard from Belinda, her relation out at Marygreen, that it was very sad, and curious!\" \"How do you mean sad? She wanted to marry him again, didn\u0027t she? And he her!\" \"Yes--that was it. She wanted to in one sense, but not in the other. Mrs. Edlin was much upset by it all, and spoke out her mind at Phillotson. But Sue was that excited about it that she burnt her best embroidery that she\u0027d worn with you, to blot you out entirely. Well--if a woman feels like it, she ought to do it. I commend her for it, though others don\u0027t.\" Arabella sighed. \"She felt he was her only husband, and that she belonged to nobody else in the sight of God A\u0027mighty while he lived. Perhaps another woman feels the same about herself, too!\" Arabella sighed again. \"I don\u0027t want any cant!\" exclaimed Jude. \"It isn\u0027t cant,\" said Arabella. \"I feel exactly the same as she!\" He closed that issue by remarking abruptly: \"Well--now I know all I wanted to know. Many thanks for your information. I am not going back to my lodgings just yet.\" And he left her straightway. In his misery and depression Jude walked to well-nigh every spot in the city that he had visited with Sue; thence he did not know whither, and then thought of going home to his usual evening meal. But having all the vices of his virtues, and some to spare, he turned into a public house, for the first time during many months. Among the possible consequences of her marriage Sue had not dwelt on this. Arabella, meanwhile, had gone back. The evening passed, and Jude did not return. At half-past nine Arabella herself went out, first proceeding to an outlying district near the river where her father lived, and had opened a small and precarious pork-shop lately. \"Well,\" she said to him, \"for all your rowing me that night, I\u0027ve called in, for I have something to tell you. I think I shall get married and settled again. Only you must help me: and you can do no less, after what I\u0027ve stood \u0027ee.\" \"I\u0027ll do anything to get thee off my hands!\" \"Very well. I am now going to look for my young man. He\u0027s on the loose I\u0027m afraid, and I must get him home. All I want you to do to-night is not to fasten the door, in case I should want to sleep here, and should be late.\" \"I thought you\u0027d soon get tired of giving yourself airs and keeping away!\" \"Well--don\u0027t do the door. That\u0027s all I say.\" She then sallied out again, and first hastening back to Jude\u0027s to make sure that he had not returned, began her search for him. A shrewd guess as to his probable course took her straight to the tavern which Jude had formerly frequented, and where she had been barmaid for a brief term. She had no sooner opened the door of the \"Private Bar\" than her eyes fell upon him-- sitting in the shade at the back of the compartment, with his eyes fixed on the floor in a blank stare. He was drinking nothing stronger than ale just then. He did not observe her, and she entered and sat beside him. Jude looked up, and said without surprise: \"You\u0027ve come to have something, Arabella? ... I\u0027m trying to forget her: that\u0027s all! But I can\u0027t; and I am going home.\" She saw that he was a little way on in liquor, but only a little as yet. \"I\u0027ve come entirely to look for you, dear boy. You are not well. Now you must have something better than that.\" Arabella held up her finger to the barmaid. \"You shall have a liqueur-- that\u0027s better fit for a man of education than beer. You shall have maraschino, or curacao dry or sweet, or cherry brandy. I\u0027ll treat you, poor chap!\" \"I don\u0027t care which! Say cherry brandy.... Sue has served me badly, very badly. I didn\u0027t expect it of Sue! I stuck to her, and she ought to have stuck to me. I\u0027d have sold my soul for her sake, but she wouldn\u0027t risk hers a jot for me. To save her own soul she lets mine go damn! ... But it isn\u0027t her fault, poor little girl-- I am sure it isn\u0027t!\" How Arabella had obtained money did not appear, but she ordered a liqueur each, and paid for them. When they had drunk these Arabella suggested another; and Jude had the pleasure of being, as it were, personally conducted through the varieties of spirituous delectation by one who knew the landmarks well. Arabella kept very considerably in the rear of Jude; but though she only sipped where he drank, she took as much as she could safely take without losing her head--which was not a little, as the crimson upon her countenance showed. Her tone towards him to-night was uniformly soothing and cajoling; and whenever he said \"I don\u0027t care what happens to me,\" a thing he did continually, she replied, \"But I do very much!\" The closing hour came, and they were compelled to turn out; whereupon Arabella put her arm round his waist, and guided his unsteady footsteps. When they were in the streets she said: \"I don\u0027t know what our landlord will say to my bringing you home in this state. I expect we are fastened out, so that he\u0027ll have to come down and let us in.\" \"I don\u0027t know--I don\u0027t know.\" \"That\u0027s the worst of not having a home of your own. I tell you, Jude, what we had best do. Come round to my father\u0027s-- I made it up with him a bit to-day. I can let you in, and nobody will see you at all; and by to-morrow morning you\u0027ll be all right.\" \"Anything--anywhere,\" replied Jude. \"What the devil does it matter to me?\" They went along together, like any other fuddling couple, her arm still round his waist, and his, at last, round hers; though with no amatory intent; but merely because he was weary, unstable, and in need of support. \"This--is th\u0027 Martyrs\u0027--burning-place,\" he stammered as they dragged across a broad street. \"I remember--in old Fuller\u0027s HOLY STATE-- and I am reminded of it--by our passing by here--old Fuller in his HOLY STATE says, that at the burning of Ridley, Doctor Smith-- preached sermon, and took as his text \u0027THOUGH I GIVE MY BODY TO BE BURNED, AND HAVE NOT CHARITY, IT PROFITETH ME NOTHING.\u0027-- Often think of it as I pass here. Ridley was a----\" \"Yes. Exactly. Very thoughtful of you, deary, even though it hasn\u0027t much to do with our present business.\" \"Why, yes it has! I\u0027m giving my body to be burned! But--ah you don\u0027t understand!--it wants Sue to understand such things! And I was her seducer--poor little girl! And she\u0027s gone-- and I don\u0027t care about myself! Do what you like with me! ... And yet she did it for conscience\u0027 sake, poor little Sue!\" \"Hang her!--I mean, I think she was right,\" hiccuped Arabella. \"I\u0027ve my feelings too, like her; and I feel I belong to you in Heaven\u0027s eye, and to nobody else, till death us do part! It is--hic--never too late--hic to mend!\" They had reached her father\u0027s house, and she softly unfastened the door, groping about for a light within. The circumstances were not altogether unlike those of their entry into the cottage at Cresscombe, such a long time before. Nor were perhaps Arabella\u0027s motives. But Jude did not think of that, though she did. \"I can\u0027t find the matches, dear,\" she said when she had fastened up the door. \"But never mind--this way. As quiet as you can, please.\" \"It is as dark as pitch,\" said Jude. \"Give me your hand, and I\u0027ll lead you. That\u0027s it. Just sit down here, and I\u0027ll pull off your boots. I don\u0027t want to wake him.\" \"Who?\" \"Father. He\u0027d make a row, perhaps.\" She pulled off his boots. \"Now,\" she whispered, \"take hold of me-- never mind your weight. Now--first stair, second stair\" \"But,--are we out in our old house by Marygreen?\" asked the stupefied Jude. \"I haven\u0027t been inside it for years till now! Hey? And where are my books? That\u0027s what I want to know?\" \"We are at my house, dear, where there\u0027s nobody to spy out how ill you are. Now--third stair, fourth stair--that\u0027s it. Now we shall get on.\" 地点是裘德在基督堂郊区的住家的门前——离他原先住的圣·西拉教堂一带很远；那地方叫他痛心疾首，他只得搬走。雨在下。一个穿着破旧黑衫裙的女人站在门口台阶上，正跟裘德说话，裘德一只手把着门。 “我这会儿孤苦伶仃，穷得光光的，连家也没有——落到这个份儿上！爸爸把我的钱都掏走了，做生意，还骂我是懒虫，我是等着活儿于呢。他就把我赶到街上来了。我这会儿只好靠老天爷了。裘德，要是你不肯帮帮忙，把我收下，我只好上救济院了，要不就得上更坏的地方。刚才我路上走的时候，就有两个大学生直朝我飞眼呢。这儿有那么多小伙子，女人要是不下水，难得很哪。” 雨里说这些话的女人是阿拉贝拉，晚上是苏又跟费乐生结婚的那天晚上。 “我替你难受，不过我这会儿也只算有个落脚地方。”裘德毫无兴致地说。 “那你是赶我走喽？” “我要给你点钱，够你几天吃住的。” “哦，难道你就不能发点善心，让我进去吗？再去找酒馆住，我真吃不消了；我真是孤苦伶什哪。裘德，看老面子，总行吧！” “你别说这个。”裘德赶紧说。“我可不想你再提那些事；你要是唠叨这些，那我就一点忙也不帮。” “这么说，我非走不可啦！”阿拉贝拉说。她把头抵在门框上，哭哭啼啼的。 “这房子全住满了，我住的那间之外，还有个小间，比柜子大不了多少——我在那儿放工具、模板，还有几本剩下来的书！” “拿我说，那比得上王宫啦！” “里头没床。” “打地铺就行了。这对我就好得不得了啦。” 裘德既不能对她忍心不管，又不知道怎么办，只好把房东叫来，跟他说，这是他一个熟人，临时要找个地方住，急得不得了。 “你大概还记得我从前在羊羔和旗子酒店当女招待吧。”阿拉贝拉插进来说。“我爸爸今儿下午臭骂我一顿，我就躲出来了，身上一个大钱也没有！” 房东说他想不起来她从前模样。“不过算啦，既然你是福来先生的朋友，咱们就凑合着让你住一两天——不过他愿不愿意担保呢？” “行，行，我担保。”裘德说。“她猛孤丁地到这儿来，我真一点不知道；不过我想还是先帮她过难关吧。”他们终于商定了，抬来一张床，勉强把它塞进裘德堆东西的小房间，也尽量叫阿拉贝拉住得舒服点，直到她能够摆脱困境——照她说，这不是她的过错——再回她父亲家。 就在他们等着放好床的时候，阿拉贝拉说：“我想你听到消息了，是吧？” “我猜得出来你指什么；不过我一无所知。” “今儿我接到阿尔夫瑞顿安妮的信。她也是刚听说婚礼定在昨儿个的；不过她不知道真办了没有。” “我不想谈这事。” “你不想谈，是呀，你当然不想谈喽。这正好表明什么样的女人——” “我说你别提她行不行！她是个糊涂虫，可也是个天使，可怜的亲爱的！” “要是真办了的话，旁人都说他就有机会回到老位子上去了，安妮信里这么说的。凡是给他帮腔的人都称了愿，里头还有主教呢。” “你饶了我吧，阿拉贝拉。” 阿拉贝拉不失时机地在小阁楼里安顿下来。开头她并不去接近裘德。她出出进进办自己的事。他们偶然在楼梯上或通道里碰上，她就告诉他，她正忙着在她顶熟的那行找位子。裘德向她建议，伦敦大概是酒店生意最吃香的地方，她摇摇头，“不行——那地方歪门邪道太多啦，”她说，“我还是在乡下不起眼的酒馆先找个事儿，那以后再说吧。” 下面那个礼拜天早上，裘德早饭比平常吃得晚点，她低声下气地问她好不好过来跟他一块儿吃早饭，因为她把茶壶摔了，那会儿铺子还没开门，没法买一个。 “行啊，你愿意就行。”他不在意地说。 他们坐着没说话，突然她开口撩他了，“老家伙，你看着一肚子心事嘛。我真替你难受。” “我是一肚子心事。” “想必是为她喽，我知道。这我管不着，不过他们要是真办了婚礼，前前后后我大概都能打听得到——只要你想知道就行。” “你怎么打听得到？” “我原来就想上阿尔夫瑞顿，把丢在那儿的几样东西取来。我见得到安妮，婚礼的事儿，她准什么都听说了，因为她在马利格林有朋友。” 裘德固然不会冒然对这样的建议表示同意，但是他对苏念念不忘的心情压倒了他平素的审慎周详，占了上风。‘你要是愿意的话，那就打听打听好啦。”他说。“我到这会儿还没打那边听到什么信呢。要是——他们真结了婚，大概也没怎么张扬。” “我手里恐怕没那么多现钱够打个来回的，要不然我早就去了。我先得赚点钱再说吧。” “哦——我可以给你出路费。”他烦躁地说。因为他对苏的境遇和可能的婚事老悬着心，这就促使他派了个最不相宜的使者去打听消息，而他若是深思熟虑，断乎不会取中这样的人选。 在裘德请她务必坐七点钟以前火车到家之后，阿拉贝拉就走了。她一走，他就说：“我何必特意给她规定个时间要她回来！她跟我有什么关系！另外那个又有什么关系！” 但是他干完活之后，情不自禁地去车站迎阿拉贝拉，心急火燎地赶到那儿，好听她带来的消息，想知道最糟糟到什么程度。阿拉贝拉在回家路上没完没了咋酒窝，咋得尽善尽美。她一出车厢就笑了。他只说出来“呃？”，一脸晦气。 “他们成婚啦。” “成婚啦——他们当然成婚喽！”他回了一句。可是她看得明白，他说话时候嘴唇绷得极不自然。 “安妮说她是听马利格林的亲戚贝林达说的，真是又惨又怪哪！” “你说惨，指什么？她要跟他再结婚，不是这回事吗？他不也要这样嘛！” “对——是这么回事。她一个心是结婚，还有一个心是不想结婚。这件事儿把艾林太太闹得都六神无主啦，她干脆把她的心事跟费乐生先生说了。可是苏为这档子事太激动啦，连从前跟你在一块儿穿的绣花睡衣都烧啦，要把你一笔勾销。呢——女人要是怎么想，就该怎么办。我倒挺佩服她，可别人不这么看。”阿拉贝拉叹了口气。“她认为他是她唯一丈夫，只要他活着，在万能的上帝眼里，她不归另外哪个人。说不定还有别的女人也想到自个儿跟她一样哪！”阿拉贝拉又叹了口气。 “我可不想听这套假仁假义！”裘德大喊大叫的。 “不是假仁假义，”阿拉贝拉说。“我想的就是跟她一样。” 他出其不意地说了下面几句，就把这个局面刹住了：“行啦——该知道的，我这会儿全知道啦！多谢你把消息告诉我。我这会儿还不想回住的地方。”说完了，把她撂一边，扬长而去。 裘德愁肠百结，意气消沉。他把从前跟苏一起走过的地方差不多走个遍；后来他也不知道还往哪儿去好，就想回去吃那顿定时的晚饭。不过他这人品德固然不错，毛病也颇不少，有些还挺顽固，所以他转身到了一家酒馆，多少个月来这还是头一回。苏对于她结婚可能造成的种种后果中间这一点，可没用心好好想过。 在同一时间，阿拉贝拉却回去了。到了晚上该歇的时间，还不见裘德转来。九点半，阿拉贝拉又出去了，她先去离河边一个挺偏僻的地方，她父亲就住在那儿，新近开了个勉强混的猪肉铺。 “嗨，”她对他说，“那晚上你把我骂了个够，因为我有事要跟你说，我不记恨又来啦。我就要结婚安家了。有件事，你可得帮忙；我替你忙活过了，这个情你得还。” “只要你滚了，我干什么都行。” “那好吧。我马上去找我那个小伙子。我怕他胡来，得把他带家里来。回来得晚，今儿晚上我要你办的，就是别闩门，我大概要在这儿睡。” “我就想得到，没几天你就腻了，在外边混不下去啦！” “好啦——别闩门，我就是这句话。” 她紧接着往外跑，先奔到裘德的住处，弄明白他的确没回来，然后开始搜寻他。她灵机一动，猜到他大概去向，就直奔裘德从前常照顾的那个酒馆，她在那儿也干过几天女招待。她一开“包间”的门，就看到他——在厢座后首的灯影里坐着，两眼无神，盯着地上。他刚喝的啤酒没别的酒劲大。他并没朝她望，于是她走进去，往他旁边一坐。 裘德抬头一看，一点也不觉着怪地说，‘你是来喝点吧，阿拉贝拉？……我正恨不得把她忘了呢；非这样不可啊！可是我办不到啊！我要回家啦。”她知道他稍微有点醉，不过也就是那么一点，不怎么样。 “我来就是为找到你呀，亲爱的孩子。你身体不舒服。这会儿你该喝点比这好的。”阿拉贝拉朝女招待往上一伸指头。“你得来点利古酒，有学问的人喝这个比喝啤酒更对路。你还可以来马拉奇诺，也可以要干古拉索、甜古拉索，要樱桃白兰地也行。” “我才不管什么酒呢！就来樱桃白兰地吧。……苏待我真坏啊，太坏啦。我可万没想到苏这样！我一直守住她，她也该守住我啊！我为她连灵魂都卖了，她可不肯狠下心为我卖一点啊！她为救自己的灵魂，宁可叫我灵魂下地狱哟！……不过这也不是她的过错啊，可怜的小姑娘哪——我敢说不是她的过错！” 阿拉贝拉究竟怎么弄到钱，这不清楚，反正她给他们各要了一杯利古酒；裘德呢，好像在这个五花八门的酒国里，有个老马识途的人给他指路，有点乐不可支的样子。阿拉贝拉喝起来老是落在他后边挺远的；不过他大口喝的时候，她尽管小口抿，还是多少以她完全不上脑子为限，可还是喝了不少，上了脸，红红的。 她那晚上对他一直甜言蜜语，温存体贴。只要他说出来，而又不断地说，“我才不在乎倒什么霉呢。”她就答话，“我可在乎啊。”酒馆关门时间到了，他们只好出去；阿拉贝拉乘势搂住他的腰，带着他摇摇晃晃往前走。 到了街上，阿拉贝拉说，“我可不知道，我要是把你这个样儿带回家，房东不定怎么说呢。我倒愿意咱们给关在外边，省得他下来开门让咱们进去了。” “我不知道——我不知道。” “你连个家都没有，这就糟透啦。我跟你说，裘德，咱们有个顶好的解决办法。就上我爸爸家里去——今儿个我算跟他讲和了。我能把你带进去，谁也看不见；明儿早上你人就回醒过来啦。” “怎么办都行——上哪儿都行。”裘德回答说。“这他妈的算得了什么？” 他们一块儿往前走，像一般喝醉的夫妇那样，她还是胳臂搂着他的腰，后来他也搂起她来了，当然并非半点出自爱意，只是因为他困倦，走不稳，得靠着东西。 “这——是殉教者——给烧死的地方呀。”他们拖拖拉拉地跨过一条很宽的大街时，他结结巴巴地说。“我记得——老弗勒那本《圣诫》里头——一过这儿——我就想起来啦——老弗勒在《圣诫》里头说，在黎德利上火刑那会儿——史密斯博士——就讲起道来啦，就拿这样的经文开篇啦——‘又舍己身叫人焚烧，却没有爱，仍然于我无益。’——我一到这儿，老是想起来。黎德利是个——” “对啦。一点不错。你这人思想才深呢，亲爱的，话说回来，这跟咱们这会儿的事儿可不相干哪。” “什么话，怎么不相干！我现在正舍身给人烧哪！可是——唉——你一点不懂啊！——这类事，只有苏才懂呢！我是她的诱奸者哟——可怜的小姑娘！她走啦——我也不管自己是什么下场啦！你想怎么收拾我都行！……可她做事是本着良心哪！可怜的小苏啊！” “去她的吧！——我是说，我觉着她做得对呢。”阿拉贝拉直打嗝。“我也有我的感情，跟她的一样；所以我觉着，老天爷眼里头，我就是你的人，不是别的什么人的，不到咱们死，不分开！俗话说——嗝——只要改——嗝——什么时候都不晚！” 他们到了她父亲的房子。她轻轻推开门，在屋里摸索着，找火柴。这会儿的情景同已经年深日久的那回进水芹峪小房子的情景简直没两样。阿拉贝拉的动机怕也没两样吧。尽管裘德没往这上面想，她可是想到了呢。 “我找不着火柴，亲爱的。”她闩k门以后说。“不过没关系——就这么走吧。你可千万别出声，来吧。” “真是黑咕隆咚啊。”裘德说。 “把手递给我，我领着你。就这样，就坐在这儿，我要给你脱靴子。我不想吵醒他。” “吵醒谁呀？” “爸爸。吵醒了，他大概要混闹一阵子呢。” 她给他脱了靴子。“哪，”她小声说，‘靠紧了我——别怕压得重。哪，一碰，两蹬——” “可是——咱们这是不是到那个靠着马利格林的老屋子呀？”迷迷糊糊的裘德问。“到现在多年啦，我没到过里头呢！嗨，我的书放在哪儿呀？我就是想知道。” “咱们是在我家里头，亲爱的，这儿谁也别想偷瞧你病成什么样儿。哪——三磴，四磴——好嘛，咱们就这样上去。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/292/7828.html","bookId":190,"book":{"id":190,"title":"无名的裘德 Jude the Obscure","description":"简介：
