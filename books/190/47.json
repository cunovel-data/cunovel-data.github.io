{"id":5938,"no":47,"title":"Part 5 Chapter 8","content":"IN the afternoon Sue and the other people bustling about Kennetbridge fair could hear singing inside the placarded hoarding farther down the street. Those who peeped through the opening saw a crowd of persons in broadcloth, with hymn-books in their hands, standing round the excavations for the new chapel-walls. Arabella Cartlett and her weeds stood among them. She had a clear, powerful voice, which could be distinctly heard with the rest, rising and falling to the tune, her inflated bosom being also seen doing likewise.\n It was two hours later on the same day that Anny and Mrs. Cartlett, having had tea at the Temperance Hotel, started on their return journey across the high and open country which stretches between Kennetbridge and Alfredston. Arabella was in a thoughtful mood; but her thoughts were not of the new chapel, as Anny at first surmised.\n \"No--it is something else,\" at last said Arabella sullenly. \"I came here to-day never thinking of anybody but poor Cartlett, or of anything but spreading the Gospel by means of this new tabernacle they\u0027ve begun this afternoon. But something has happened to turn my mind another way quite. Anny, I\u0027ve heard of un again, and I\u0027ve seen HER!\"\n \"Who?\"\n \"I\u0027ve heard of Jude, and I\u0027ve seen his wife. And ever since, do what I will, and though I sung the hymns wi\u0027 all my strength, I have not been able to help thinking about \u0027n; which I\u0027ve no right to do as a chapel member.\"\n \"Can\u0027t ye fix your mind upon what was said by the London preacher to-day, and try to get rid of your wandering fancies that way?\"\n \"I do. But my wicked heart will ramble off in spite of myself!\"\n \"Well--I know what it is to have a wanton mind o\u0027 my own, too! If you on\u0027y knew what I do dream sometimes o\u0027 nights quite against my wishes, you\u0027d say I had my struggles!\" (Anny, too, had grown rather serious of late, her lover having jilted her.)\n \"What shall I do about it?\" urged Arabella morbidly.\n \"You could take a lock of your late-lost husband\u0027s hair, and have it made into a mourning brooch, and look at it every hour of the day.\"\n \"I haven\u0027t a morsel!--and if I had \u0027twould be no good.... After all that\u0027s said about the comforts of this religion, I wish I had Jude back again!\"\n \"You must fight valiant against the feeling, since he\u0027s another\u0027s. And I\u0027ve heard that another good thing for it, when it afflicts volupshious widows, is to go to your husband\u0027s grave in the dusk of evening, and stand a long while a-bowed down.\"\n \"Pooh! I know as well as you what I should do; only I don\u0027t do it!\"\n They drove in silence along the straight road till they were within the horizon of Marygreen, which lay not far to the left of their route. They came to the junction of the highway and the cross-lane leading to that village, whose church-tower could be seen athwart the hollow. When they got yet farther on, and were passing the lonely house in which Arabella and Jude had lived during the first months of their marriage, and where the pig-killing had taken place, she could control herself no longer.\n \"He\u0027s more mine than hers!\" she burst out. \"What right has she to him, I should like to know! I\u0027d take him from her if I could!\"\n \"Fie, Abby! And your husband only six weeks gone! Pray against it!\"\n \"Be damned if I do! Feelings are feelings! I won\u0027t be a creeping hypocrite any longer--so there!\"\n Arabella had hastily drawn from her pocket a bundle of tracts which she had brought with her to distribute at the fair, and of which she had given away several. As she spoke she flung the whole remainder of the packet into the hedge \"I\u0027ve tried that sort o\u0027 physic and have failed wi\u0027 it. I must be as I was born!\"\n \"Hush! You be excited, dear! Now you come along home quiet, and have a cup of tea, and don\u0027t let us talk about un no more. We won\u0027t come out this road again, as it leads to where he is, because it inflames \u0027ee so. You\u0027ll be all right again soon.\"\n Arabella did calm herself down by degrees; and they crossed the Ridge-way. When they began to descend the long, straight hill, they saw plodding along in front of them an elderly man of spare stature and thoughtful gait. In his hand he carried a basket; and there was a touch of slovenliness in his attire, together with that indefinable something in his whole appearance which suggested one who was his own housekeeper, purveyor, confidant, and friend, through possessing nobody else at all in the world to act in those capacities for him. The remainder of the journey was down-hill, and guessing him to be going to Alfredston they offered him a lift, which he accepted.\n Arabella looked at him, and looked again, till at length she spoke. \"If I don\u0027t mistake I am talking to Mr. Phillotson?\"\n The wayfarer faced round and regarded her in turn. \"Yes; my name is Phillotson,\" he said. \"But I don\u0027t recognize you, ma\u0027am.\"\n \"I remember you well enough when you used to be schoolmaster out at Marygreen, and I one of your scholars. I used to walk up there from Cresscombe every day, because we had only a mistress down at our place, and you taught better. But you wouldn\u0027t remember me as I should you?--Arabella Donn.\"\n He shook his head. \"No,\" he said politely, \"I don\u0027t recall the name. And I should hardly recognize in your present portly self the slim school child no doubt you were then.\"\n \"Well, I always had plenty of flesh on my bones. However, I am staying down here with some friends at present. You know, I suppose, who I married?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Jude Fawley--also a scholar of yours--at least a night scholar-- for some little time I think? And known to you afterwards, if I am not mistaken.\"\n \"Dear me, dear me,\" said Phillotson, starting out of his stiffness. \"You Fawley\u0027s wife? To be sure--he had a wife! And he-- I understood--\"\n \"Divorced her--as you did yours--perhaps for better reasons.\"\n \"Indeed?\"\n \"Well--he med have been right in doing it--right for both; for I soon married again, and all went pretty straight till my husband died lately. But you--you were decidedly wrong!\"\n \"No,\" said Phillotson, with sudden testiness. \"I would rather not talk of this, but--I am convinced I did only what was right, and just, and moral. I have suffered for my act and opinions, but I hold to them; though her loss was a loss to me in more ways than one!\"\n \"You lost your school and good income through her, did you not?\"\n \"I don\u0027t care to talk of it. I have recently come back here--to Marygreen. I mean.\"\n \"You are keeping the school there again, just as formerly?\"\n The pressure of a sadness that would out unsealed him. \"I am there,\" he replied. \"Just as formerly, no. Merely on sufferance. It was a last resource--a small thing to return to after my move upwards, and my long indulged hopes a returning to zero, with all its humiliations. But it is a refuge. I like the seclusion of the place, and the vicar having known me before my so-called eccentric conduct towards my wife had ruined my reputation as a schoolmaster, he accepted my services when all other schools were closed against me. However, although I take fifty pounds a year here after taking above two hundred elsewhere, I prefer it to running the risk of having my old domestic experiences raked up against me, as I should do if I tried to make a move.\"\n \"Right you are. A contented mind is a continual feast. She has done no better.\"\n \"She is not doing well, you mean?\"\n \"I met her by accident at Kennetbridge this very day, and she is anything but thriving. Her husband is ill, and she anxious. You made a fool of a mistake about her, I tell \u0027ee again, and the harm you did yourself by dirting your own nest serves you right, excusing the liberty.\"\n \"How?\"\n \"She was innocent.\"\n \"But nonsense! They did not even defend the case!\"\n \"That was because they didn\u0027t care to. She was quite innocent of what obtained you your freedom, at the time you obtained it. I saw her just afterwards, and proved it to myself completely by talking to her.\"\n Phillotson grasped the edge of the spring-cart, and appeared to be much stressed and worried by the information. \"Still--she wanted to go,\" he said.\n \"Yes. But you shouldn\u0027t have let her. That\u0027s the only way with these fanciful women that chaw high--innocent or guilty. She\u0027d have come round in time. We all do! Custom does it! It\u0027s all the same in the end! However, I think she\u0027s fond of her man still--whatever he med be of her. You were too quick about her. I shouldn\u0027t have let her go! I should have kept her chained on-- her spirit for kicking would have been broke soon enough! There\u0027s nothing like bondage and a stone-deaf taskmaster for taming us women. Besides, you\u0027ve got the laws on your side. Moses knew. Don\u0027t you call to mind what he says?\"\n \"Not for the moment, ma\u0027am, I regret to say.\"\n \"Call yourself a schoolmaster! I used to think o\u0027t when they read it in church, and I was carrying on a bit. \u0027Then shall the man be guiltless; but the woman shall bear her iniquity.\u0027 Damn rough on us women; but we must grin and put up wi\u0027 it! Haw haw! Well; she\u0027s got her deserts now.\"\n \"Yes,\" said Phillotson, with biting sadness. \"Cruelty is the law pervading all nature and society; and we can\u0027t get out of it if we would!\"\n \"Well--don\u0027t you forget to try it next time, old man.\"\n \"I cannot answer you, madam. I have never known much of womankind.\"\n They had now reached the low levels bordering Alfredston, and passing through the outskirts approached a mill, to which Phillotson said his errand led him; whereupon they drew up, and he alighted, bidding them good-night in a preoccupied mood.\n In the meantime Sue, though remarkably successful in her cake-selling experiment at Kennetbridge fair, had lost the temporary brightness which had begun to sit upon her sadness on account of that success. When all her \"Christminster\" cakes had been disposed of she took upon her arm the empty basket, and the cloth which had covered the standing she had hired, and giving the other things to the boy left the street with him. They followed a lane to a distance of half a mile, till they met an old woman carrying a child in short clothes, and leading a toddler in the other hand.\n Sue kissed the children, and said, \"How is he now?\"\n \"Still better!\" returned Mrs. Edlin cheerfully. \"Before you are upstairs again your husband will be well enough--don\u0027t \u0027ee trouble.\"\n They turned, and came to some old, dun-tiled cottages with gardens and fruit-trees. Into one of these they entered by lifting the latch without knocking, and were at once in the general living-room. Here they greeted Jude, who was sitting in an arm-chair, the increased delicacy of his normally delicate features, and the childishly expectant look in his eyes, being alone sufficient to show that he had been passing through a severe illness.\n \"What--you have sold them all?\" he said, a gleam of interest lighting up his face.\n \"Yes. Arcades, gables, east windows and all.\" She told him the pecuniary results, and then hesitated. At last, when they were left alone, she informed him of the unexpected meeting with Arabella, and the latter\u0027s widowhood.\n Jude was discomposed. \"What--is she living here?\" he said.\n \"No; at Alfredston,\" said Sue.\n Jude\u0027s countenance remained clouded. \"I thought I had better tell you?\" she continued, kissing him anxiously.\n \"Yes.... Dear me! Arabella not in the depths of London, but down here! It is only a little over a dozen miles across the country to Alfredston. What is she doing there?\"\n She told him all she knew. \"She has taken to chapel-going,\" Sue added; \"and talks accordingly.\"\n \"Well,\" said Jude, \"perhaps it is for the best that we have almost decided to move on. I feel much better to-day, and shall be well enough to leave in a week or two. Then Mrs. Edlin can go home again--dear faithful old soul-- the only friend we have in the world!\"\n \"Where do you think to go to?\" Sue asked, a troublousness in her tones.\n Then Jude confessed what was in his mind. He said it would surprise her, perhaps, after his having resolutely avoided all the old places for so long. But one thing and another had made him think a great deal of Christminster lately, and, if she didn\u0027t mind, he would like to go back there. Why should they care if they were known? It was oversensitive of them to mind so much. They could go on selling cakes there, for that matter, if he couldn\u0027t work. He had no sense of shame at mere poverty; and perhaps he would be as strong as ever soon, and able to set up stone-cutting for himself there.\n \"Why should you care so much for Christminster?\" she said pensively. \"Christminster cares nothing for you, poor dear!\"\n \"Well, I do, I can\u0027t help it. I love the place--although I know how it hates all men like me--the so-called self-taught,--how it scorns our laboured acquisitions, when it should be the first to respect them; how it sneers at our false quantities and mispronunciations, when it should say, I see you want help, my poor friend! ... Nevertheless, it is the centre of the universe to me, because of my early dream: and nothing can alter it. Perhaps it will soon wake up, and be generous. I pray so! ... I should like to go back to live there--perhaps to die there! In two or three weeks I might, I think. It will then be June, and I should like to be there by a particular day.\"\n His hope that he was recovering proved so far well grounded that in three weeks they had arrived in the city of many memories; were actually treading its pavements, receiving the reflection of the sunshine from its wasting walls.\n \n 下午，苏和肯尼桥庙会上摩肩接踵的人群能听见远在街那头的贴着告示的木围子里的歌声。有些人从围隙窥视，看到一群穿黑呢袍的人，手持赞美诗本子，站在新挖的礼拜堂基地周围。阿拉贝拉·卡特莱一身丧服，也夹在那伙人中间。她歌喉清脆、嘹亮，在齐唱声中可以听得很清楚，她的丰满的胸脯随着曲调的低昂而起伏。\n 又过了两个钟头之后，安妮和卡特莱太太已在禁酒旅店用过午后茶点，随即起身驱车返家，路上要穿过肯尼桥和阿尔夫瑞顿之间开阔的洼地。阿拉贝拉心事很重，不过她想的不是安妮起先猜想的礼拜堂的事情。\n “不是新礼拜堂的事情——是别的事。”阿拉贝拉终于闷闷不乐地说出来。“我今儿上这儿来，一心想着可怜的卡特莱，压根儿也没想过别人，无非借今儿下午他们开始造这么个圣堂的机会，传播传播福音，也没想别的事。可是说来也巧，有件事一下子把我的心思岔到一边儿去啦。安妮，我又听说裘德的消息啦，还见到她！”\n “谁呀？”\n “我听说裘德的消息，还见到他妻子。这之后，我再怎么克制，再怎么憋足了劲唱赞美诗，我还是没法不想他。我既是礼拜堂的会众，这就太不该了。”\n “这么说，你今儿真是没法定心听伦敦布道师讲道喽？你就没想法把邪想头压下去吗？”\n “我确实这么做啦，可我的心邪啦，它不听我的，一个劲儿往邪里跑！”\n “呃——我自个儿心里也人过魔，我知道这滋味！你要是知道我夜里做的那些不想做的梦，你准说我是怎么拼命才挣过来的！”（安妮近来变得相当规矩，因为她的情人把她甩了。）\n “那你说我得怎么办？”阿拉贝拉神思恍惚地盯间她。\n “你可以拿你刚过世的男人一绺头发做个念心，一天到晚瞧着就行啦。”\n “我连他一根头发丝也没有——就算有，也没用。……说是说，信教能给人安慰，可我还是希望把裘德弄回来。”\n “你可得下决心跟这样的感情斗才行，因为他是人家的人啦。我还听说个好办法，寡妇要是心邪了，都那样。你就到天快黑了，上你男人坟头那儿，低头站着，站老半天。”\n “我知道该怎么办，用不着你说；我才不干呢！”\n 她们顺着笔直的大道前进，在进入马利格林的地界之前，谁也没再说话。那个村子位于她们走的路线左首不远，到了大路同通往马利格林的小路交叉的地方，隔着洼地就望得见村教堂的塔楼。马车再往前赶，正好路过阿拉贝拉和裘德婚后头几个月住的偏僻的小房子，当年他们一块儿杀猪的地方。这时她再也没法控制自己了。\n “他得算我的，不是她的！”她不禁脱口而出。“她对他有什么权利，我倒要知道知道！只要办得到，我就非从她那儿把他弄回来不可！”\n “放屁，阿贝！你男人才死了六个礼拜，你就这样！快祈祷吧，认罪吧！”\n “我才他妈的不管呢！感情就是感情！我可不会装模作样，当个节妇。我就是这么回事儿！”\n 阿拉贝拉一下子从口袋里扯出来一捆功世文，这本来是她要带到庙会散发的，也散过几份。她一边说，一边把剩下的劝世文全都扔到树篱后边去了。“这个方子，我试过啦，根本没用。我生来怎么样，就怎么样！”\n “嘘，你心全乱啦，亲爱的！这会儿你定定心，先到家，再喝杯茶，好不好，咱们也别提他吧。既是你一听说他，就急火攻心，以后别走这条路好啦，它是往那边通的。待会儿你就什么事也没啦。”\n 阿拉贝拉果然慢慢平静下来，她们正跨过山脊路。在她们赶着车从又长又陡的山坡下来的时候，瞧见一个上了年纪的男人，身体瘦弱，步子迂缓，在她们前头吃力地走着。他手上提个篮子，穿着有点邋遢，再看他外表那份形容不出来的味道，不兔让人想他这人大概索居独处，乏人照料，只好集管家、采办、知心和朋友于一身。她们猜他多半是往阿尔夫瑞顿，因为还剩一段路，就提出带他一块儿走，他也就答应了。\n 阿拉贝拉看了看他，接着仔细看了一遍，终于开口说道，“要是我没认错的话，你就是费乐生先生吧？”\n 那位走路人转过脸对着她，也仔细看她。“对，对；我是叫费乐生。”他说。“太太，我可不认得你。”\n “我记得可清楚呢，那会儿你是那边马利格林的老师，我也是你的学生。我那会几天天打水芹峪走着上学，因为我们那儿只有位女老师，没你教得好。不过你不会像我记得你，还记得我这个学生，我叫阿拉贝拉·邓恩。”\n 他摇摇头。“不记得了。”他客气地说，“这个名字我想不起来了。再说那会儿学生无疑都细条条的，你这会儿挺富态的，我怎么认得哪。”\n “呃，我从前就胖乎乎的。说点别的吧，我这会儿跟几个朋友住在这一带。我想你总知道我跟谁结了婚吧？”\n “不知道。”\n “跟裘德·福来呀，他也算你的学生，至少算个夜校学生吧？我猜他以后的事，你也听说过吧？”\n “哎呀，哎呀。”费乐生说，他本来很拘谨，这时变了。“你是裘德的妻子？怎么着——他有妻子！他——据我了解——”\n “他跟我离啦——跟你跟她离了一样，不过他离，更有道理就是了。”\n “真的？”\n “哎——他这离，得说是离对了——对我们俩都得这么说，因为我立等着再结婚。直到我丈夫新近死了之前，样样都怪顺利的，可是你哪——那可错到家啦！”\n “我根本没错。”费乐生说，顿时冒起火来。“我不想谈这个。可是我自信完全做得对，做得公道，做得道德。我的行动、想法叫我吃了苦头，可是我一点不后悔；她走了固然对我是损失，而且损失是多方面的，可是我决不后悔！”\n “你不是经她这么一搞，连学校带那么高进项全吹了吗？”\n “我不想谈这些。我新近才回到这地方，我是说马利格林。”\n “那你又完全跟先头一样，到这儿教书啦！”\n 他内心伤痛的压力把他长久以来的缄默打破了。\n “我到这儿教书，”他回答道，“也不是跟从前在这儿完全一样。这全是人家大度包容，才留下我。这是我唯一仰赖糊口的机会——要比我从前的成就、长久抱着的种种奢望，现在真算是穷途末路——又成了一无所有的孤家寡人，丢人现眼极啦。所幸还有这个托身之所。我喜欢这地方遗世独立，远离尘嚣。在我因为对妻子采取的所谓荒谬之举，搞得我这个当教师的身败名裂之前，此地教区长就认识我了，在别的学校一律把我拒之门外的时候，他收留了我，让我工作。虽然我从前在别处一年拿两百镑，在这儿才拿五十镑，可是我宁愿这样，也不想别人再把我家庭变故抖落出来，指摘我。这个险，我是不想冒啦。”\n “你这么想才对呢。知足常乐嘛。她的情形也好不到哪儿去。”\n “你这是说她的日子不好过？”\n “就是今儿个，我真没想到在肯尼桥碰上她，她可没什么可得意的。她男人病了，她心里挺急。我还要说一遍，你对她那样，太糊涂啦，全错啦。别怪我瞎说，你这是往自个儿脸上抹黑，把自个儿搞臭，所以是自作自受啊。”\n “你怎么好这么说？”\n “因为她清清白白，没点过错。”\n “这话太没意思！打官司时候，他们连一句也没申辩过！”\n “那是因为他们本来就不想申辩。她清清白白的，没想离，你硬要离，你那时候自由了，殊不知你那么一来反而成全了她。你这事刚过去，我就见过她，跟她谈过，证明我看得不错。”\n 费乐生一把抓住了弹簧马车的边缘；他一听这番话，就如同受了打击，非常痛苦。\n “就算是这样吧，她还是要走啊。”\n “不错，是那么回事儿。可是你就不该放她走嘛。对付那些个一心想攀高枝的女人，清白也好，出了漏子也好，就用这个办法。到时候，她只好回头了，听话了。咱们女人全是这个味儿！只要叫她惯了就行啦！就是她再闹，到头来还不是一样！话又说回来——依我看，她这会儿还是爱她男人，别管他对她怎么样。你那会儿对她太欠考虑。换了我，那就决不放她走！我要拿铁链子把她拴上，叫她哪儿也去不了——没几天，她想反也反不起来啦！要叫咱们女人听话，就得一靠捆绑二靠什么话也不听的工头。这还不算，你手上还攥着法律。摩西清楚得很哪。难道你就想不起来他老人家怎么说的？”\n “对不起，太太，这会儿我想不起来。”\n “你这还算个老师吗！从前他们在教堂念到这儿的时候，我一想，真有点气不打一处来，‘男人就为无罪，妇人必担当自己的罪孽。’对咱们女人真他妈的狠哪；不过咱们还得一笑了之，别当回事儿！嘿，嘿！得了吧；她总算现世现报啦。”\n “是啊。”费乐生说，心如刀割。“残忍无情是整个自然界和社会的无所不在的法则；不管咱们怎么想，也逃不出它手心啊！”\n “呃——老先生，难道往后再有机会你就不想试试这个法则？”\n “我可没法跟你说，太太。我这个人压根儿就不大懂女人是怎么回事。”\n 他们这时到了同阿尔夫瑞顿接界的平敞地方，在穿过这个镇郊区，快到磨坊的时候，费乐生说他要到磨坊办点事。她们在那儿把车刹住，费乐生下了车，满腔心事的样子，向她们道了别。\n 同时，苏尽管在肯尼桥庙会试做蛋糕生意很成功，但成功一时给她的苦恼表情渲染的光彩却暗然消失。“基督堂糕”一卖完，她就挎起空篮子和那块租来罩摊子的白布，叫孩子拿着剩下的东西，跟她一块儿离开庙会那条街；顺着一个小巷子走了半英里光景，迎面来了位老太婆，她抱着一个穿短衣的娃儿，还牵着一个没完全学好走路的小孩子。\n 她吻了孩子，说，“他这会儿怎么样？”\n “要好多啦！”艾林太太高兴地回答。“等不到你以后在楼上坐月子，你丈夫就没事啦——你就放心吧。”\n 他们往回走，到了几家有花园、栽果树的褐瓦顶小房子前面，把一家门搭扣一抬，没敲门就进去了，门里就是大起居室。他们向坐在圈椅上的裘德招呼了一下，他平常脸上本来清癯，这时更见消瘦，眼神流露孩子般的期待，一望而知他得过重病。\n “怎么——全卖完啦？”他说，脸上顿然很感兴趣的样子。\n “都卖啦。走廊、山墙、东窗什么的都卖啦。”她把卖了多少钱告诉他，似乎还有话要说，又不好就说。等到屋里只剩下他们俩，她才把怎么意外遇上阿拉贝拉的经过和阿拉贝拉丧偶的事逐一跟他说了。\n 裘德显出来心烦。“怎么——她住在这地方？”\n “没住在这儿，是在阿尔夫瑞顿。”\n 裘德的脸色还是很阴沉。“我想还是告诉你好。”她继续说，心里着急地吻了他。\n “是该告诉我……唉！阿拉贝拉不在伦敦那个见不到底的地方混，倒跑到这儿来啦！从这儿出去，过了乡下，到阿尔夫瑞顿才十二英里多点。她在那儿干什么？”\n 她把知道的都跟他说了。“她现在拿上礼拜堂当回事，”她补充说：“谈来谈去也是上礼拜堂的事。”\n “呃，”裘德说。“反正咱们大致定了再搬个地方，也许这样顶好。我今天觉着好多了，再过一两个礼拜，一大好就可以离开这儿。艾林太太那时候也能回家了——亲爱的老人家待人真忠厚啊——这世界咱们就这么一个朋友啊！”\n “你打算上哪儿呢？”她说话的声调明显带着焦虑。\n 于是裘德一五一十说了自己的想法。他说，他这么多年下定决心避开旧游之地之后，这个想法也许叫她太感意外，无如他老是免不了怀念基督堂，要是她不反对，他很愿意回到那边。就算有人认得他们，那又何必顾虑？他们就是太敏感，所以这也不放心，那也不放心。要是他还不好干活，那就无妨再做蛋糕卖。他不会因为穷，就觉着见不起人；说不定他很快就恢复到原先那么壮实，还能在那儿独立干凿石活儿。\n “你怎么老是这么惦着基督堂？”她心里怪不舒服地说。“基督堂可一点不惦着你啊，可怜的亲爱的！”\n “我实在惦着它，这我也没办法啊。我爱那地方——虽然我明知它对所有我这样所谓自学的人极端憎恶，对我们经过刻苦攻读而在学问上取得的成就嗤之以鼻，而它本应该首先出来尊重这些人才对；它因为我们发错了音、拼错了词，而嘲弄备至，而它本应该说，可怜的朋友，我看你需要帮助啊！……虽然这样，我早年的梦想还是让我把它当成宇宙的中心，再怎么样也改变不了我这个想法。或许它不久以后会醒悟吧，不久以后会变得宽宏大量吧。我要为它祷告，但愿它走这一步！我实在想回到那儿，在那儿生活——也许在那儿死掉！两三个礼拜以后，我想我大概可以回到那儿，那就到六月了。我愿意在一个不寻常的日子回到那儿。”\n 他对自己逐渐康复所抱的希望，确实不无根据，因为两三个礼拜后，他们就到了那个有多少往事可供回忆的城市，实实在在地踩着它的人行道，实实在在地享受它日益敝旧的墙壁上反射的阳光。\n \n
