{"id":100466,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"FROM THE SHADOWS The ground shaking beneath his bed awakened High Captain Kurth one dismal morning. As soon as he got his bearings and realized he wasn\u0027t dreaming, the former pirate acted with the reflexes of a warrior, rolling off the side of his bed to his feet while in the same movement grabbing his sword belt from the bed pole and slapping it around his waist. \"You will not need that,\" came a quiet, melodic voice from the shadows across the large, circular room, the second highest chamber in Kurth Tower. As his dreams faded and the moment of alarm passed, Kurth recognized the voice as one that had visited him unbidden twice before in that very room. The high captain gnashed his teeth and considered spinning and throwing one of the many daggers set in his sword belt. This is no enemy, he reminded himself, though without much conviction, for he wasn\u0027t certain who the mysterious visitor really was. \"The western window,\" the voice said. \"It has begun.\" Kurth moved to that window and pulled open the heavy drapes, flooding the room with the dawn\u0027s light. He looked in the direction from which the voice had sounded, hoping to catch a glimpse of its source from the shadows, but that edge of his chamber defied the morning light and remained as dark as a moonless midnight - magic, Kurth was certain, and potent magic, indeed. The tower had been sealed against magical intrusion by Arklem Greeth himself. And yet, there was the visitor - again! Kurth turned back to the west, to the slowly brightening ocean. A dozen boulders and balls of pitch drew fiery lines in the air, flying fast for the Hosttower, or for various parts of the rocky shore of Cutlass Island. \"See?\" asked the voice. \"It is as I have assured you.\" \"Rethnor\u0027s son is a fool.\" \"A fool who will prevail,\" the voice replied. It was hard to argue that possibility, given the line of ships throwing their missiles at Cutlass Island. Their work was meticulous. They threw in unison and with concentrated aim. He counted fifteen ships firing, though there might have been a couple more hidden from view. In addition, another group of wide, low boats ferried along the line then back to Whitesails Harbor to get more ammunition. Whitesails Harbor! The reality hit Kurth hard. Whitesails served as the harbor for Luskan\u0027s navy, a flotilla under the auspices, supposedly, of the five high captains as directed by the Hosttower. The ships at Whitesails were the pretty front to the ugly piracy behind Luskan\u0027s riches. Deudermont knew those pirates, and they knew him, and many of them hated him and had lost friends to Sea Sprite\u0027s exploits on the open seas. Despite that, the nagging thought - reinforced as more and more masts lined up beside Sea Sprite and Brambleberry\u0027s warships - was that the Luskar sailors might well desert. As improbable as it seemed, he couldn\u0027t deny what he saw with his own eyes. Luskan\u0027s fleet, and the men and women of Whitesails, were directly involved in supporting the bombardment of the Hosttower of the Arcane. The men and women of Luskan\u0027s fleet were in open revolt against Arklem Greeth. \"The fool with his undead,\" Kurth muttered. Arklem Greeth had pushed too hard, too wickedly. He had crossed a line and had driven the whole of the city against him. The high captain kept his gaze to the northwest, to Whitesails Harbor, and though he couldn\u0027t make out much from that distance, he clearly saw the banner of Mirabar among many on the quayside. He imagined Mirabarran dwarves and men working hard to load the courier ships with rocks and pitch. Full of anxiety, Kurth turned angrily at the hidden visitor. \"What do you demand of me?\" \"Demand?\" came the reassuring reply, in a tone that seemed truly surprised by the accusation. \"Nothing! I...we, are not here to demand, but to advise. We watch the wave of change and measure the strength of the rocks against which that wave will break. Nothing more.\" Kurth scoffed at the obvious understatement. \"So, what do you see? And do you truly understand the strength of those rocks to which you so poetically refer? Do you grasp the power of Arklem Greeth?\" \"We have known greater foes, and greater allies. Captain Deudermont has an army of ten thousand to march against the Hosttower.\" \"And what do you see in that?\" Kurth demanded. \"Opportunity.\" \"For that wretch Deudermont.\" A chuckle came from the darkness. \"Captain Deudermont has no understanding of the forces he will unwittingly unleash. He knows good and evil, but nothing more, but we - and you - see shades of gray. Captain Deudermont will scale to unstable heights in short order. His absolutes will rally the masses of Luskan, then will send them into revolt.\" Kurth shrugged, unconvinced, and fearful of the reputation and power of Captain Deudermont. He suspected that those mysterious outside forces, that hidden character who had visited him twice before, never threateningly, but never comfortably, were sorely underestimating the good captain and the loyalty of those who would follow him. \"I see the rule of law, heavy and cumbersome,\" he said. \"We see the opposite,\" said the voice. \"We see five men of Luskan who will collect the spoils set free when the Hosttower falls. We see only two of those five who are wise enough to separate the copper from the gold.\" Kurth paused and considered that for a while. \"A speech you give to Taerl, Suljack, and Baram, too, no doubt,\" he replied at length. \"Nay. We have visited none of them, and come to you only because the son of Rethnor, and Rethnor himself, insist that you are the most worthy.\" \"I\u0027m flattered, truly,\" Kurth said dryly. He did well to hide his smile and his suspicion, for whenever his \"guest\" so singled him out as one of importance, it occurred to him that his guest might indeed be a spy from the Hosttower, even Arklem Greeth himself, come to test the loyalty of the high captains in difficult times. It was Arklem Greeth, after all, who had strengthened the magical defenses of Kurth Tower and Closeguard Island a decade before. What wizard would be powerful enough to circumvent defenses set in place by the archmage arcane, but the archmage arcane himself? What wizard in Luskan could claim the power of Arklem Greeth? None who were not in the Hosttower, as far as Kurth knew, would even be close, other than that Robillard beast who sailed with Deudermont, and if his guest was Robillard, that raised the banner of duplicity even higher. \"You will be flattered,\" the voice responded, \"when you come to understand the sincerity behind the claim. Rethnor and Kensidan will show outward respect to all of their peers - \" \"It\u0027s Rethnor\u0027s Ship alone, unless and until he formally cedes it to Kensidan,\" Kurth insisted. \"Quit referring to that annoying Crow as one whose word is of any import.\" \"Spare us both your quaint customs, for they are a ridiculous assertion to me, and a dangerous delusion for you. Kensidan\u0027s hand is in every twist of that which you see before you: the Mirabarrans, the Waterdhavians, Deudermont himself, and the defection of a quarter of Arklem Greeth\u0027s forces.\" \"You openly admit that to me?\" Kurth replied, the implication being that he could wage war on Ship Rethnor for such a reality. \"You needed to hear it to know it?\" Kurth narrowed his eyes as he stared into the darkness. The rest of the room had brightened considerably, but still no daylight touched that far corner - or ever would unless his guest willed it to be so. \"Arklem Greeth\u0027s rule is doomed, this day,\" the voice said. \"Five men will profit most from his fall, and two of those five are wise enough and strong enough to recognize it. Is one of those two too stubborn and set in his ways to grasp the chest of jewels?\" \"You ask me for a declaration of loyalty,\" Kurth replied. \"You ask me to disavow my allegiance to Arklem Greeth.\" \"I ask nothing of you. I help to explain to you that which is occurring outside your window, and show you paths I think wise. You walk those paths or you do not of your own volition.\" \"Kensidan sent you here,\" Kurth accused. A telling pause ensued before the voice answered, \"He didn\u0027t, directly. It\u0027s his respect for you that guided us here, for we see the possible futures of Luskan and would prefer that the high captains, above all, above Deudermont and above Arklem Greeth, prevailed.\" Just as Kurth started to respond, the door to his room burst open and his most trusted guards rushed in. \"The Hosttower is under bombardment!\" one cried. \"A vast army gathers at our eastern bridge, demanding passage!\" said the other. Kurth glanced to the shadows - to where the shadows had been, for they were gone, completely. So was his guest, whoever that guest might have been. Arabeth and Robillard walked along Sea Sprite\u0027s rail before the line of archers, waggling their fingers and casting devious, countering enchantments on the piles of arrows at each bowman\u0027s feet. The ship lurched as her aft catapult let fly a large ball of pitch. It streaked through the air, unerringly for the Hosttower\u0027s westernmost limb, where it hit and splattered, launching lines of fire that lit up bushes and already scorched grass at the base of the mighty structure. But the tower itself had repelled the strike with no apparent ill effects. \"The archmage arcane defends it well,\" Arabeth remarked. \"Each hit takes from his defenses, and from him,\" Robillard replied. He bent low and touched another pile of arrows. Their silvery tips glowed for just a moment before going dim again. \"Even the smallest of swords will wear through the strongest warrior\u0027s shield if they tap it enough.\" Arabeth looked to the Hosttower and laughed aloud, and Robillard followed her gaze. The ground all around the five-limbed structure was thick with boulders, ballista bolts, and smoldering pitch. Sea Sprite and her companion vessels had been launching non-stop against Cutlass Island throughout the morning, and at Robillard\u0027s direction, all of their firepower had been directed at the Hosttower itself. \"Do you think they will respond?\" Arabeth asked. \"You know Greeth as well as I do,\" Robillard answered. He finished with the last batch of arrows, waited for Arabeth to do likewise, then led her back to his usual perch behind the mainsail. \"He will grow annoyed and will order his defenders along the shore to lash out.\" \"Then we will make them pay.\" \"Only if we\u0027re quick enough,\" Robillard replied. \"Every one of them will be guarded by spells to counter a dozen arrows,\" said the woman of Mirabar. \"Then every one will be hit by thirteen,\" came Robillard\u0027s dry reply. Sea Sprite shuddered again as a rock flew out, along with ten others from the line, all soaring in at the Hosttower with such precision and timing that a pair collided before they reached their mark and skipped harmlessly away. The others shook the ground around the place, or smacked against the Hosttower\u0027s sides, to be repelled by its defensive magic. Robillard looked to the north where one of Brambleberry\u0027s boats eased a bit closer against the strong currents of the Mirar. \"Sails!\" Robillard cried, and Sea Sprite\u0027s crew flipped the lines, unfurling fast. From the rocks of the northwestern tip of Cutlass Island, a pair of lightning bolts reached out at Brambleberry\u0027s ship, scorching her side, tearing one of her sails. With the strong and favorable current, though, the ship was able to immediately reverse direction. Even as Sea Sprite leaned and splashed to life, Robillard and Arabeth filled her sails with sudden and powerful winds. They didn\u0027t even take the time to pull up the anchor, but just cut the line, and Sea Sprite turned straight in, bucking the currents with such jolting force that all aboard had to grab on and hold tight. Arklem Greeth\u0027s wizards focused on Brambleberry\u0027s boat for far too long, as Robillard had hoped, and by the time the Hosttower contingent noticed the sudden charge of Sea Sprite, she was close enough so that those on her deck could see the small forms scrambling across the rocks and ducking for whatever cover they could find. From a more southern vantage on Cutlass Island, a lightning bolt streaked out at Sea Sprite, but she was too well warded to be slowed by the single strike. Her front ballista swiveled and threw a heavy spear at the point from which that attack had emanated, and as Sea Sprite began her broadside turn, her prow bending to straight north in a run up the coast, the crack catapult crew on her aft deck had another ball of pitch flying away. It splattered among the rocks and several men and women scrambled up from the burning ground, one engulfed in flame, all screaming. And those weren\u0027t even the primary targets, which were to starboard, trying to hide as a bank of archers the length of Sea Sprite\u0027s main deck and three deep lifted and bent their bows. Three separate volleys went in, enchanted arrows all, skipping off the stones or striking against the defensive magic shields Greeth\u0027s minions had raised. But as Robillard had predicted, more arrows found their way than could be defeated by the enchantments, and another Hosttower wizard fell dead on the stones. Lightning bolts and arrows reached out at Sea Sprite from the rocky coastline. Boulders and balls of pitch flew out from the ship line in response, followed by a devastating barrage of arrows as Sea Sprite veered due west and sped away with the fast current. Robillard nodded his approval. \"One dead, perhaps, or perhaps two,\" said Arabeth. \"It\u0027s difficult work.\" \"Another one Arklem Greeth cannot afford to lose,\" Robillard replied. \"Our tricks will catch fewer and fewer. Arklem Greeth will teach his forces to adapt.\" \"Then we will not let him keep up with our evolving tricks,\" Robillard said, and nodded his chin toward the line of ships, all of whom were pulling up anchor. One by one, they began to glide to the south. \"Sea Tower,\" Robillard explained, referring to the strong guard tower on southern Cutlass Island. \"It would cost Arklem Greeth too much energy to have it as fortified as the Hosttower, so we\u0027ll bombard it to rubble, and destroy every other defensible position along the southern coast of the island.\" \"There are few places to land even a small boat in those rocky waters,\" Arabeth replied. \"Sea Tower was built so that defenders could assault any ships attempting to enter the southern mouth of the Mirar, and not as a defense for Cutlass Island.\" Robillard\u0027s deadpan expression quieted her, for of course he knew all of that. \"We\u0027re tightening the noose,\" he explained. \"I expect that those inside the Hosttower are growing more uncomfortable by the hour.\" \"We nibble at the edges when we must bite out the heart of the place,\" Arabeth protested. \"Patience,\" said Robillard. \"Our final fight with the lich will be brutal - no one doubts that. Hundreds will likely die, but hundreds more will surely perish if we attack before we prepare the battlefield. The people of Luskan are on our side. We own the streets. We have Harbor Arm and Fang Island fully under our control. Whitesails Harbor sides with us. Captain\u0027s Court is ours, and Illusk has been rendered quiescent once again. The Mirar bridges are ours.\" \"Those that remain,\" said Arabeth, to which Robillard chuckled. \"Arklem Greeth hasn\u0027t a safehouse left in the city, or if he does, his minions there are huddled in a dark basement, trembling - rightfully so! - in fear. And when we have bombed Sea Tower to rubble, and have chased off or killed all of his minions he placed in the southern reaches of Cutlass, Arklem Greeth will need to look south, on his own shores, as well. Unrelenting bombardment, unrelenting pressure, and keep clear in your mind that if we lose ten men - nay, fifty! - for every Arcane Brotherhood wizard we slay, Captain Deudermont will claim victory in a rout.\" Arabeth Raurym considered the older and wiser wizard\u0027s words for some time before nodding her agreement. Above all else, she wanted the archmage arcane dead, for she knew with certainty that if he wasn\u0027t killed, he would find a way to kill her - a horrible, painful way, no doubt. She looked south as Sea Sprite came around Fang Island, to see that the other ships were already lining up to begin the bombardment of Sea Tower. Sea Sprite\u0027s bell rang and the men tacked accordingly to slow her as a trio of ammunition barges from Whitesails Harbor turned around the horn of Harbor Arm Island and crossed in front of her. Arabeth looked over to regard Robillard and could almost hear the calculations playing out behind his eyes. He had orchestrated every piece of the day\u0027s action - the bombardment, the trap and attack, and the turn south, complete with supply lines - to the most minute detail. She understood how Deudermont had gained such a glorious reputation hunting the ever-elusive pirates of the Sword Coast. He had surrounded himself with the finest crew she had ever seen, and standing beside him was the wizard Robillard, so calculating and so very, very deadly. A shiver ran along Arabeth\u0027s spine, but it was one of hope and reassurance as she reminded herself that Robillard and Sea Sprite were on her side. From his eastern balcony, High Captain Kurth and his two closest advisors, one the captain of his guard and the other a high-ranking commander in Luskan\u0027s garrison, watched the gathering of thousands at the small bridge that linked Closeguard Island to the city. Deudermont was there, judging from the banners, and Brambleberry as well, though their ships were active in the continuing, unrelenting bombardment of Cutlass Island to the west. For a moment, Kurth envisioned the whole of the invading army enveloped in the flames of a gigantic Arklem Greeth fireball, and it was not an unpleasant mental image - briefly, at least, until he considered the practical ramifications of having a third of Luskan\u0027s populace lying dead and charred in the streets. \"A third of the populace....\" he said aloud. \"Aye, and most o\u0027 me soldiers in the bunch,\" said Nehwerg, who had once commanded the garrison at Sea Tower, which was even then crumbling under a constant rain of boulders. \"They could have ten times that number and not get across, unless we let them,\" insisted Master Shanty, Kurth Tower\u0027s captain of the guard. The high captain chuckled at the ridiculous, empty boast. He could make Deudermont and the others pay dearly for trying to cross to Closeguard - he could even drop the bridge, which his engineers had long ago rigged for just such an eventuality - but to what gain and to what end? \"There\u0027s yer bird,\" Nehwerg grumbled, and pointed down at a black spec flapping past the crowd and climbing higher in the eastern sky. \"The man\u0027s got no dignity, I tell ya.\" Kurth chuckled again and reminded himself that Nehwerg served a valuable purpose for him, and that the man\u0027s inanity was a blessing and not a curse. It wouldn\u0027t do to have such a personal liaison to the Luskar garrison who could think his way through too many layers of intrigue, after all. The black bird, the Crow, closed rapidly on Kurth\u0027s position, finally alighting on the balcony railing. It hopped down, and flipped its wings over as it did, enacting the transformation back to a human form. \"You said you would be alone,\" Kensidan said, eyeing the two soldiers hard. \"Of course my closest advisors are well aware of this particular aspect of your magical cloak, son of Rethnor,\" Kurth replied. \"Would you expect that I wouldn\u0027t have told them?\" Kensidan didn\u0027t reply, other than to let his gaze linger a bit longer on the two before turning it to Kurth, who motioned for them all to enter his private room. \"I\u0027m surprised you would ask to see me at this tense time,\" Kurth said, moving to the bar and pouring a bit of brandy for himself and Kensidan. When Nehwerg made a move toward the drink, Kurth turned him back with a narrow-eyed glare. \"It was not Arklem Greeth,\" said Kensidan, \"nor one of his lackeys. You need know that.\" Kurth looked at him curiously. \"Your shadowy visitor,\" Kensidan explained. \"It was not Greeth, not an ally of Greeth in any way, and not a mage of the Arcane Brotherhood.\" \"Bah, but who\u0027s he talking about?\" demanded Nehwerg, and Master Shanty stepped up beside his high captain. Kurth impatiently waved them both back. \"How do you...?\" Kurth started to ask, but stopped short and just smirked at the surprising, dangerous upstart. \"No wizard outside of Arklem Greeth\u0027s inner circle could penetrate the magical defenses he has set in place in Kurth Tower,\" Kensidan said as if reading Kurth\u0027s mind. Kurth tried hard to not look impressed, and just held his smirk, inviting the Crow to continue. \"Because it was no wizard,\" Kensidan said. \"There is another type of magic involved.\" \"Priests are no match for the web of Arklem Greeth,\" Kurth replied. \"Do you think him foolish enough to forget the schools of those divinely inspired?\" \"And no priest,\" said Kensidan. \"You\u0027re running out of magic-users.\" Kensidan tapped the side of his head and Kurth\u0027s smirk turned back into an unintentional, intrigued expression. \"A mind mage?\" he asked quietly, a Luskar slang for those rare and reputably powerful practitioners of the concentration art known as psionics. \"A monk?\" \"I had such a visitor months ago, when first I started seeing the possibilities of Captain Deudermont\u0027s future,\" Kensidan explained, taking the glass from Kurth and settling into a chair in front of the room\u0027s generous hearth, which had only been lit a few minutes earlier and wasn\u0027t yet throwing substantial heat. Kurth took the seat across from Rethnor\u0027s son and motioned for Nehwerg and Master Shanty to stand a step behind him. \"So the machinations of this rebellion, the inspiration even, came from outside Luskan?\" Kurth asked. Kensidan shook his head. \"This is a natural progression, a response to the overreaching of Arklem Greeth both on the high seas, where Deudermont roams, and in the east, in the Silver Marches.\" \"Which all came together in this \u0027coincidental\u0027 conglomeration of opponents lining up against the Hosttower?\" Kurth asked, doubt dripping from every sarcastic word. \"I don\u0027t believe in coincidence,\" Kensidan replied. \"And yet, here we are. Do you admit that Kensidan\u0027s hand, that Ship Rethnor\u0027s hands, are in this?\" \"Up to our elbows...our shoulders, perhaps,\" Kensidan said with a laugh, and lifted his glass in toast. \"I didn\u0027t create this opportunity, but neither would I let it pass.\" \"You, or your father?\" \"He is my advisor - you know as much.\" \"A startling admission, and a dangerous one,\" said Kurth. \"How so? Have you heard the rumble on the island to your west? Have you seen the gathering at the gates of Closeguard Bridge?\" Kurth considered that for a moment, and it was his turn to tip his glass to his companion. \"So Arklem Greeth has frayed the many strings, and Kensidan of Ship Rethnor has worked to weave them into something to his own benefit,\" said Kurth. Kensidan nodded. \"And these others? Our shadowy visitors?\" Kensidan rubbed his long and thin fingers over his chin. \"Consider the dwarf,\" he said. Kurth stared at him curiously for a few moments, recalling the rumors from the east regarding the Silver Marches. \"King Bruenor? The dwarf King of Mithral Hall works for the fall of Luskan? \"No, not Bruenor. Of course it\u0027s not Bruenor, who, by all reports, has troubles enough to keep him busy in the east, thank the gods.\" \"But it\u0027s Bruenor\u0027s strange friend who rides with Deudermont,\" said Kurth. \"Not Bruenor,\" Kensidan replied. \"He has no place or part in any of this, and how the dark elf happened back to Deudermont\u0027s side I neither know nor care.\" \"Then what dwarves? The Ironspur Clan from the mountains?\" \"Not dwarves,\" Kensidan corrected. \"Dwarf. You know of my recent acquisition...the bodyguard?\" Kurth nodded, finally catching on. \"The creature with the unusual morningstars, yes. How could I not know? The one whose ill-fashioned rhymes grate on the nerves of every sailor in town. He has brawled in every tavern in Luskan over the last few months, mostly over his own wretched poetry, and from what my scouts tell me, he\u0027s a far better fighter than he is a poet. Ship Rethnor strengthened her position on the street greatly with that one. But he is tied to all of this?\" Kurth waved his arm out toward the western window, where the sound of the bombardment had increased yet again. Kensidan nodded his chin at Master Shanty and Nehwerg, staring all the while into Kurth\u0027s dark eyes. \"They are trusted,\" Kurth assured him. \"Not by me.\" \"You have come to my Ship.\" \"To advise and to offer, and not under duress, and nor under duress shall I stay.\" Kurth paused and seemed to be taking it all in, glancing from his guest to his guards. It was obvious to Kensidan that the man was intrigued, though, and so it came as no surprise when he turned at last to the two guards and ordered them out of the room. They protested, but Kurth would hear none of it and waved them away. \"The dwarf was a gift to me from these visitors, who take great interest in establishing strong trading ties with Luskan. They are here for commerce, not conquest - that is my hope at least. And my belief, for were they openly revealed, we would be facing greater lords of Waterdeep than Brambleberry, do not doubt, and King Bruenor, Marchion Elastul of Mirabar, and Lady Alustriel of Silverymoon wouldn\u0027t be far behind with their own armies.\" Kurth felt a bit more perplexed and defensive, and a lot less intrigued. \"These events were not their doing, but they watch closely, and advise me and my father, as they have visited you,\" said Kensidan, hoping that naming Rethnor almost as an afterthought had slipped past the perceptive Kurth. The man\u0027s arched eyebrow showed that it had not, however, and Kensidan silently berated himself and promised that he would do better in the future. Ship Rethnor wasn\u0027t yet officially his. Not officially. \"So you hear voices in the shadows, and these bring you confidence,\" Kurth said. He held up his hand as Kensidan tried to interrupt and continued, \"Then we\u0027re back at the initial square of the board, are we not? How do you know your friends in the shadows aren\u0027t agents of Arklem Greeth? Perhaps the cunning lich has decided it\u0027s time to test the loyalties of his high captains. Are you too young to see the dangerous possibilities? And wouldn\u0027t that make you the biggest fool of all?\" Kensidan held up his open palm and finally managed to silence the man. He slowly reached under his strange black cloak and produced a small glass item, a bottle, and within it stood the tiny figure of a tiny man. No, not a figure, Kurth realized. His eyes widened as the poor soul trapped within shifted about. Kensidan motioned to the hearth. \"May I?\" Kurth responded with a puzzled expression, which Kensidan took as permission. He flung the bottle into the hearth, where it smashed against the back bricks. The tiny man enlarged, bouncing around the low-burning logs before catching his bearings and his balance enough to roll back out, taking ash and one burning log with him. \"By the Nine Hells!\" the man protested, batting at his smoldering gray cloak. Blood dripped from several wounds on his hands and face and he reached up and pulled a small shard of glass out of his cheek. \"Don\u0027t ever do that to me again!\" he cried, still flustered and waving his arms. It seemed then as if he had at last caught his bearings, and only then he realized where he was and who was seated before him. The blood drained from his face. \"Are you settled?\" Kensidan asked. The thoroughly flustered little man toed the log beside him and brushed it back into the fireplace, but didn\u0027t otherwise respond. \"High Captain Kurth, I give you Morik,\" Kensidan explained. \"Morik the Rogue, to those who know him enough to care. His lady is a mage in the Hosttower - perhaps that is why he\u0027s found a place in all this.\" Morik looked anxiously from man to man, dipping many short bows. Kensidan drew Kurth\u0027s gaze with his own. \"Our visitors are not agents of Arklem Greeth,\" he said, before turning to the pathetic little man and motioning for him to begin. \"Tell my friend your story, Morik the Rogue,\" Kensidan bade him. \"Tell him of your visitors those years ago. Tell him of the dark friends of Wulfgar of Icewind Dale.\" \"I told ye they wouldn\u0027t get across without a row,\" Baram insisted to his fellow high captains, Taerl and Suljack. The three stood atop the southwest tower of High Captain Taerl\u0027s fortress, looking directly west to the bridge to Kurth\u0027s Closeguard Island and the great open square south of Illusk where Deudermont and Lord Brambleberry had gathered their mighty army. \"They will,\" Suljack replied. \"Kensi - Rethnor said they will, and so they will.\" \"That Crow boy is trouble,\" said Baram. \"He\u0027ll bring down Rethnor\u0027s great Ship before the old man passes on.\" \"The gates will open,\" Suljack replied, but very quietly. \"Kurth can\u0027t refuse. Not this many, not with almost all of Luskan knocking.\" \"Hard to be denyin\u0027 that number,\" Taerl said. \"Most o\u0027 the city\u0027s walking with Deudermont.\" \"Kurth won\u0027t go against Arklem Greeth - he\u0027s more sense than that,\" Baram replied. \"Deudermont\u0027s fools\u0027ll be swimming or sailing if they want to get to the Hosttower.\" Even as Baram spoke, some of High Captain Kurth\u0027s sentries rushed up to the bridge and began throwing the locks. To Baram\u0027s utter shock, and to Taerl\u0027s as well, despite his words, the gates of the Kurth Tower compound pulled open and Kurth\u0027s guards stepped back, offering passage. \"A trick!\" Baram protested, leaping to his feet. \"She\u0027s got to be a trick! Arklem Greeth\u0027s bidding them on that he can destroy them.\" \"He\u0027ll have to kill half the city, then,\" Suljack said. Deudermont\u0027s banner led the way across the small bridge with more than five thousand in his wake. Out in the harbor beyond Cutlass Island, sails appeared and anchors climbed from the water. The fleet began to creep in, boulders and pitch leading the way. The noose tightened.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-pirate-king-transitions-2/page-16.html","bookId":2188,"book":{"id":2188,"title":"The Pirate King (Transitions #2)","description":"Storyline: The Pirate King (Transitions #2) The Arcane Brotherhood has long held the city of Luskan in their power, but when corruption eats away at their ranks, Captain Deudermont comes to the rescue of a city that has become a safe haven for the Sword Coast\u0027s most dangerous pirates.
