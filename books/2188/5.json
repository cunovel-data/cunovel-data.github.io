{"id":100455,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"FISHING FOR MEMORIES I t was a prime example of the good that can come through cooperation,\" Drizzt remarked, and his smirk told Regis that he was making the lofty statement more to irk Bruenor than to make any profound philosophical point. \"Bah, I had to choose between orcs and demons...\" \"Devils,\" the halfling corrected and Bruenor glared at him. \"Between orcs and devils,\" the dwarf king conceded. \"I picked the ones what smelled better.\" \"You were bound to do so,\" Regis dared say, and it was his turn to toss a clever wink Drizzt\u0027s way. \"Bah, the Nine Hells I was!\" \"Shall I retrieve the Treaty of Garumn\u0027s Gorge that we might review the responsibilities of the signatories?\" Drizzt asked. \"Yerself winks at him and I put me fist into yer eye, then I toss Rumblebelly down the hallway,\" Bruenor warned. \"You cannot blame them for being surprised that King Bruenor would go to the aid of an orc,\" came a voice from the door, and the three turned as one to watch Catti-brie enter the room. \"Don\u0027t ye join them,\" Bruenor warned. Catti-brie bowed with respect. \"Fear not,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve come for my husband, that he can see me on my way.\" \"Back to Silverymoon for more lessons with Alustriel?\" Regis asked. \"Beyond that,\" Drizzt answered for her as he walked across to take her arm. \"Lady Alustriel has promised Catti-brie a journey that will span half the continent and several planes of existence.\" He looked at his wife and smiled with obvious envy. \"And how long\u0027s that to take?\" Bruenor demanded. He had made it no secret to Catti-brie that her prolonged absences from Mithral Hall had created extra work for him, though in truth, the woman and everyone else who had heard the dwarf\u0027s grumbling had understood it to be his way of admitting that he sorely missed Catti-brie without actually saying the words. \"She gets to escape another Mithral Hall winter,\" Regis said. \"Have you room for a short but stout companion?\" \"Only if she turns you into a toad,\" Drizzt answered and led Catti-brie away. Later that same day, Regis walked outside of Mithral Hall to the banks of the River Surbrin. His remark about winter had reminded him that the unfriendly season was not so far away, and indeed, though the day was glorious, the wind swept down from the north, blustery and cold, and the leaves on the many trees across the river were beginning to show the colors of autumn. Something in the air that day, the wind or the smell of the changing season, reminded Regis of his old home in Icewind Dale. He had more to call his own in Mithral Hall, and security - for where could be safer than inside the dwarven hall? - but the things he\u0027d gained did little to alleviate the halfling\u0027s sense of loss for what had been. He had known a good life in Icewind Dale. He\u0027d spent his days fishing for knucklehead trout from the banks of Maer Dualdon. The lake had given him all he needed and more, with water and food - he knew a hundred good recipes for cooking the delicious fish. And few could carve their skulls more wonderfully than Regis. His trinkets, statues, and paperweights had earned him a fine reputation among the local merchants. Best of all, of course, was the fact that his \"work\" consisted mostly of lying on the banks of the lake, a fishing line tied to his toe. With that in mind, Regis spent a long time walking along the riverbank, north of the bridge, in search of the perfect spot. He finally settled on a small patch of grass, somewhat sheltered from the north wind by a rounded gray stone, but one not high enough to shade him at all. He took great care in getting his line out to just the right spot, a quieter pool around the edge of a stony jut in the dark water. He used a heavy weight, but even that wouldn\u0027t hold if he put the line into the main flow of the river; the strong currents would wash it far downstream. He waited a few moments, and confident that his location would hold steady, he removed a shoe, looped the line around his big toe, and dropped his pack to use as a pillow. He had barely settled down and closed his eyes when a noise from the north startled him. He recognized the source before he even sat up to look beyond the rounded stone. Orcs. Several young ones had gathered at the water\u0027s edge. They argued noisily - why were orcs always so boisterous? - about fishing lines and fishing nets and where to cast and how to cast. Regis almost laughed aloud at himself for his bubbling annoyance, for he understood his anger even as he felt it. They were orcs, and so he was angry. They were orcs, and so he was impatient. They were orcs, and so his first reaction had to be negative. Old feelings died hard. Regis thought back to another time and another place, recalling when a group of boys and girls had begun a noisy splash fight not far from where he had cast his line in Maer Dualdon. Regis had scolded them that day, but only briefly. As he thought of it, he couldn\u0027t help grin, remembering how he had then spent a wonderful afternoon showing those youngsters how to fish, how to play a hooked knucklehead, and how to skin a catch. Indeed, that long-ago night, the group of youngsters had arrived at Regis\u0027s front door, at his invitation, to see some of his carvings and to enjoy a meal of trout prepared only as Regis knew how. Among so many uneventful days on the banks of Maer Dualdon, that one stood out in Regis\u0027s memory. He considered the noisy orc youngsters again, and laughed as he watched them try to throw a net - and wind up netting one young orc girl instead. He almost got up, thinking to go and offer lessons as he had on that long ago day in Icewind Dale. But he stopped when he noticed the boundary marker between his spot and the orcs. Where the mountain spilled down to the Surbrin marked the end of Mithral Hall and the beginning of the Kingdom of Many-Arrows, and across that line, Regis could not go. The orcs noticed him, then, just as he scowled. He lifted a hand to wave, and they did likewise, though more than a little tentatively. Regis settled back behind the stone, not wanting to upset the group. One day, he thought, he might be able to go up there and show them how to throw a net or cast a line. One day soon, perhaps, given the relative peace of the past four years and the recent cooperative ambush that had destroyed a potential threat to the Silver Marches. Or maybe he would one day wage war against those very orc youngsters, kill one with his mace or be taken in the gut by another\u0027s spear. He could picture Drizzt dancing through that group then and there, his scimitars striking with brilliant precision, leaving the lot of them squirming and bleeding on the rocks. A shudder coursed the halfling\u0027s spine, and he shook away those dark thoughts. They were building something there, Regis had to believe. Despite Bruenor\u0027s stubbornness and Obould\u0027s heritage, the uneasy truce had already become an accepted if still uneasy peace, and it was Regis\u0027s greatest hope that every day that passed without incident made the prospect of another dwarf-orc war a bit more remote. A tug on the line had him sitting up, and once he had the line in hand, he scrambled to his feet, working the line expertly. Understanding that he had an audience, he took his time landing the fish, a fine, foot-long ice perch. When at last he landed it, he held it up to show the young orcs, who applauded and waved enthusiastically. \"One day I will teach you,\" Regis said, though they were too far away - and upwind and with a noisy river bubbling by - and could not hear. \"One day.\" Then he paused and listened to his own words and realized that he was musing about orcs. Orcs. He had killed orcs, and with hardly a care. A moment of uncomfortable regret seized the halfling, followed quickly by a sense of complete confusion. He suppressed all of that, but only momentarily, by going back to work on his line, putting it back out in the calmer waters of the pool. Orcs. Orcs! Orcs? \"Bruenor wishes to speak with you?\" Catti-brie asked Drizzt when he returned to their suite of rooms late one night, only to be met by Bruenor\u0027s page with a quiet request. A tenday had passed since the fight with the devils and the situation had calmed considerably. \"He is trying to sort through the confusion of our recent adventure.\" \"He wants you to go to Mirabar with Torgar Hammerstriker,\" Catti-brie reasoned. \"It does seem ridiculous,\" Drizzt replied, agreeing with Catti-brie\u0027s incredulous tone. \"In the best of times, and the most secure, Marchion Elastul would not grant me entrance.\" \"A long way to hike to camp out on the cold ground,\" Catti-brie quipped. Drizzt moved up to her, grinning wickedly. \"Not so unwelcome an event if I bring along the right bedroll,\" he said, his hands sliding around the woman\u0027s waist as he moved even closer. Catti-brie laughed and responded to his kiss. \"I would enjoy that.\" \"But you cannot go,\" Drizzt said, moving back. \"You have a grand adventure before you, and one you would not wisely avoid.\" \"If you ask me to go with you, I will.\" Drizzt stepped back, shaking his head. \"A fine husband I would be to do so! I have heard hints of some of the wonders Alustriel has planned for you throughout the next few months, I could not deny you that for the sake of my own desires.\" \"Ah, but don\u0027t you understand how alluring it is to know that your desires for me overwhelm that absolute sense of right and wrong that is so deeply engrained into your heart and soul?\" Drizzt fell back at that and stared at Catti-brie, blinking repeatedly. He tried to respond several times, but nothing decipherable came forth. Catti-brie let her laughter flow. \"You are insufferable,\" she said, and danced across the room from Drizzt. \"You spend so much time wondering how you should feel that you rarely ever simply do feel.\" Knowing he was being mocked, Drizzt crossed his arms over his chest and turned his confused stare into a glare. \"I admire your judgment, all the while being frustrated by it,\" Catti-brie said. \"I remember when you went into Biggrin\u0027s cave those many years ago, Wulfgar at your side. It was not a wise choice, but you followed your emotions instead of your reason. What has happened to that Drizzt Do\u0027Urden?\" \"He has grown older and wiser.\" \"Wiser? Or more cautious?\" she asked with a sly grin. \"Are they not one and the same?\" \"In battle, perhaps,\" Catti-brie replied. \"And since that is the only arena in which you have ever been willing to take a chance....\" Drizzt blew a helpless sigh. \"A span of a few heartbeats can make for a greater memory than the sum of a mundane year,\" Catti-brie continued. Drizzt nodded his concession. \"There are still risks to be had.\" He started for the door, saying, \"I will try to be brief, though I suspect your father will wish to talk this through over and over again.\" He glanced back as he grabbed the handle and pulled the door open, shaking his head and smiling. His expression changed when he considered his wife. She had unfastened the top two buttons of her colorful shirt and stood looking at him with a sly and inviting expression. She gave a little grin and shrug, and chewed her bottom lip teasingly. \"It wouldn\u0027t be a wise choice to keep the king waiting,\" she said in a voice far too innocent. Drizzt nodded, paused, and slammed and locked the door. \"I\u0027m his son by marriage now,\" he explained, gliding across the room, his sword belt falling to the floor as he went. \"The king will forgive me.\" \"Not if he knew what you were doing to his daughter,\" Catti-brie said as Drizzt wrapped her in a hug and tumbled down to the bed with her. \"If Marchion Elastul will not grant me entrance, I will walk past his gates and along my road,\" Drizzt was saying when Catti-brie entered Bruenor\u0027s chambers later on that night. Regis was there as well, along with Torgar Hammerstriker and his Mirabarran companion, Shingles McRuff. \"He\u0027s a stubborn one,\" Shingles agreed with Drizzt after giving a nod to Catti-brie. \"But ye\u0027ve a longer road by far.\" \"Oh?\" Catti-brie asked. \"He\u0027s for Icewind Dale,\" Bruenor explained. \"Him and Rumblebelly.\" Catti-brie stepped back at the surprising news and looked to Drizzt for an explanation. \"Me own decision,\" Bruenor said. \"We\u0027re hearing that Wulfgar\u0027s settled back there, so I\u0027m thinking that Drizzt and Rumblebelly might be looking in on him.\" Catti-brie considered it for a few moments then nodded her agreement. She and Drizzt had discussed a journey to Icewind Dale to see their old friend. Word had come to Mithral Hall not long after the signing of the Treaty of Garumn\u0027s Gorge that Wulfgar was well and back in Icewind Dale, and Catti-brie and Drizzt had immediately begun plotting how they might go to him. But they had delayed, for Wulfgar\u0027s sake. He didn\u0027t need to see them together. He had left Mithral Hall to start anew, and it wouldn\u0027t be fair for them to remind him of the life he could have had with Catti-brie. \"I will be back in Mithral Hall before your return,\" Drizzt promised her. \"Maybe,\" Catti-brie replied, but with an accepting smile. \"Both of our roads are fraught with adventure,\" Drizzt said. \"And neither of us would have it any other way,\" Catti-brie agreed. \"I expect that\u0027s why we\u0027re in love.\" \"Ye\u0027re knowing that other people are in the room, I\u0027m guessin\u0027,\" Bruenor said rather gruffly, and the two looked at the dwarf to see him shaking his head and rolling his eyes.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-pirate-king-transitions-2/page-5.html","bookId":2188,"book":{"id":2188,"title":"The Pirate King (Transitions #2)","description":"Storyline: The Pirate King (Transitions #2) The Arcane Brotherhood has long held the city of Luskan in their power, but when corruption eats away at their ranks, Captain Deudermont comes to the rescue of a city that has become a safe haven for the Sword Coast\u0027s most dangerous pirates.
