A mistake! Is that what you call it? You damn fool, you were supposed to wait until she was here.\"\n Drade shrugged again. \"What\u0027s done is done.\"\n \"That\u0027s all you have to say? Is that what you want me to tell Lord Brezor? I\u0027m sorry, but what\u0027s done is done?\"\n \"You\u0027ll think of something.\"\n \"You\u0027d damn well better hope I do, because if I go down, I\u0027m taking you with me. What\u0027s happening there now?\"\n \"Everything\u0027s under control. The mine itself is undamaged. As far as everyone knows, it was an unprovoked attack by the Hodorians.\" Drade frowned. \"Two of my men were found dead a short distance from the house.\"\n \"What happened to them?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure. I think one of the servants must have killed them and escaped through the back wall. I wouldn\u0027t worry about it, though. The jungle will take care of whoever it was.\"\n Niklaus ran a hand through his hair. This whole thing had gone from bad to worse. It had all seemed so simple at the beginning. He swore under his breath. There had to be a way to make it work. A forged letter from Marcus, perhaps, bequeathing him ownership of the mine? Or papers alleging that he had bought half the mine? One way or another, he had to gain control of the mine; it was the only way to fulfill his bargain with the Cenian ambassador, the only way to save himself from ruin.\n \"Hassrick?\"\n \"You\u0027re sure she\u0027s dead?\"\n \"The house was leveled. No one could have gotten out.\"\n \"Someone killed your men.\"\n \"Yeah, but I\u0027m willing to bet it wasn\u0027t the girl.\"\n Niklaus grunted softly. At the sound of his father\u0027s voice, he muttered a quick goodbye and broke the connection.\n He would find a way out of this mess somehow.\n His future, his reputation, depended on it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-captive/page-10.html","bookId":2305,"book":{"id":2305,"title":"The Captive","description":"Storyline: \n Relieved from deadly toil in the mines, a slave is brought to his master\u0027s household to work and there encounters a new form of torture in a seductive young woman who he is forbidden to have.
