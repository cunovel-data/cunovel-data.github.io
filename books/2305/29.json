{"id":94944,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"Darfs dwelling was dark when they arrived, and Falkon knew, deep in his gut, that the house was empty.\n Darf paused and sniffed the air. \"Someone\u0027s been here.\"\n \"Yeah,\" Falkon muttered, and knew that the men in the bar hadn\u0027t been sent to spy on them or to kill them, but to delay them. \"Drade.\"\n Darf turned to face him, his pale yellow eyes glowing in the dark.\n \"Drade?\"\n Falkon nodded. \"They\u0027ve taken the women.\"\n With an oath, Darf turned and ran toward the house. Flinging open the door, he darted inside. \"Chaney? Chancy!\"\n A cold dark anger settled over Falkon as he followed Darf into the house.\n He stood inside the door, waiting, listening to Darfs footsteps as he went from room to room calling his wife\u0027s name.\n \"They\u0027re gone.\" Darfs voice. Flat. Empty. \"What do we do now?\"\n \"We go to Trellis.\"\n Darf didn\u0027t ask why. Going to a small closet, he withdrew a pair of weapons and tossed one to Falkon. \"Let\u0027s go.\"\n Ashlynne sat close to Chaney, taking comfort from the other woman\u0027s nearness. She lifted a hand to her neck, her fingers exploring the thick lynaziam collar. How had Falkon endured it for so long? She felt as if she was choking. Every time she moved her head, she felt the edge cutting into her skin. The shackles on her hands and feet were equally heavy and uncomfortable.\n She kept her gaze lowered, refusing to look at the man sitting across from her. She recognized him all right. Drade.\n She lifted a hand to the collar again, remembering all too well the sight of Falkon writhing on the ground, his body twitching uncontrollably as waves of pain speared through him.\n \"You\u0027ll get used to it.\"\n Ashlynne looked up to find Drade grinning at her.\n \"So, you\u0027re Falkon\u0027s new woman,\" Drade mused. \"He always did have good taste.\"\n Ashlynne glared at him. She was scared clear through. She and Chaney had been watching a movie when four men had burst into the house. In less than five minutes, she and Chaney had been fitted with collars and shackles and hustled into a shuttle. A short time later they were in a cruiser headed for Arkata.\n Her fingers traced the edge of the collar. \"Why are you doing this?\"\n \"Just following orders.\"\n \"Whose orders?\"\n \"Whose do you think?\"\n She shook her head, wincing as the collar scraped her skin. \"He wouldn\u0027t.\"\n Drade grunted softly. \"You should have signed the papers when he asked you to. All he wanted was the mine. He would have let you go. Now...\"\n Drade shook his head, and with that single, simple gesture, Ashlynne knew that her worst fears were about to become reality. Niklaus was going to get rid of her. He might not kill her, but he was going to put her out of his life. After she gave him the mine. She touched the collar at her throat again, and knew that she would do whatever he wanted.\n A bubble of hysterical laughter rose in her throat. Maybe they would send her back to Tierde to take Falkon\u0027s place in the mine. \"Falkon...\" His name rose to her lips.\n A victorious smile spread over Drade\u0027s face. \"Falkon. We\u0027ll have him, too.\"\n \"You hate him, don\u0027t you? Why?\"\n \"Why?\" Drade\u0027s eyes glittered with loathing. \"Ask him. Ask him about the woman he stole from me, about the battle honors that should have been mine.\"\n \"You were in love with his wife?\" Ashlynne asked, stunned.\n \"She should have been my wife,\" Drade said, his voice cold and bitter.\n \"He knew I was in love with her, knew I wanted to marry her. Did he care? No! He was always jealous of me. She should have been my wife,\" he said again. \"And now she\u0027s dead because of him.\"\n \"But you had her killed. Falkon said - \"\n \"Are you mad?\" Drade stared at her. \"I loved her.\"\n \"But...\" Ashlynne shook her head. \"He blames you.\"\n \"I would never have done anything to hurt Maiya. I was on my way to Daccar when I heard of the attack. I had hoped to get there in time to get her away, but I was too late.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\n Drade stood up. \"So am I,\" he said coldly, and left the cabin.\n \"His hatred is eating him alive,\" Chaney remarked.\n Ashlynne nodded. It was eating at Falkon, too, she thought, and wondered what he would think when he learned he had been hating Drade for something he hadn\u0027t done.\n They reached Arkata the following day. Still encumbered by the lynaziam collar and shackles, Ashlynne stood in front of Niklaus, humiliation burning in her cheeks. Again, she thought of Falkon, of the days and nights he had lived in bondage, his every waking moment controlled by the heavy collar at his neck.\n She took a deep breath and squared her shoulders, hoping Niklaus couldn\u0027t see how very frightened she was. \"Where\u0027s Chaney? What have you done with her?\"\n Niklaus looked up from the papers spread before him. \"Your furry friend is being looked after.\"\n \"The way you looked after Falkon?\"\n Niklaus looked faintly amused as he replied, \"Indeed, I believe she\u0027s in the same cell.\"\n \"You can\u0027t leave her in that dungeon!\" Ashlynne exclaimed. \"She\u0027s going to have a baby.\"\n Niklaus shrugged. \"That\u0027s what females do. I should think you would be\n more concerned about your own future.\" He tapped his finger on a stack of papers. \"There are a few things I need to have you sign.\"\n \"What things?\"\n \"I think you know.\"\n \"You want the mine.\"\n \"Yes.\" He sat back in his chair. \"You\u0027ve caused me a great deal of unnecessary trouble.\"\n Ashlynne glared at him. If he was waiting for an apology, it would be a long time coming.\n Hassrick stood up, his hands resting on the top of the desk. \"Don\u0027t make this more difficult than it has to be,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t want to hurt you, or your friend, but there\u0027s a great deal at stake here.\"\n She stared at the man who was her husband, and knew he would stop at nothing to get what he wanted. His next words confirmed it.\n \"Drade has found me a woman who looks much like you. If necessary, we\u0027ll bring her here and have her take your place. In that case, we\u0027ll have no further use for you.\"\n \"You wouldn\u0027t,\" she gasped. But he would. And she knew it. She folded her arms over her belly. If she died, her baby would die with her. Die before it ever had a chance to live.\n \"It\u0027s up to you.\"\n \"And if I do as you ask, what then?\"\n \"Why, I\u0027ll let you and your friend go, of course.\"\n He was lying. She could see it in his eyes, hear it in his voice. \"How do I know you\u0027ll let us go?\"\n \"I guess you\u0027ll just have to trust me, won\u0027t you?\" He reached into the top drawer of his desk and withdrew a controller, which he placed on the desk. \"I grow weary of this, Ashlynne.\" He picked up a pen and offered it to her.\n \"Sign the papers.\"\n \"No.\"\n He reached for the controller. Before she could tell him she had changed her mind, pain exploded through her, stealing the strength from her legs, the breath from her lungs. She gasped as she hit the floor, her body twisting, turning in a vain effort to escape the agony that engulfed her.\n When would it end? Would it ever end? It was frightening, to have no control over her body\u0027s movements, humiliating to lie there, twitching uncontrollably while Niklaus stared at her in mild amusement.\n Gradually, the spasms lessened, leaving her lying there, gasping for breath.\n \"Are you ready to sign now?\" Niklaus asked.\n Taking hold of a corner of the desk, she pulled herself to her feet. \"Yes.\"\n \"I knew I could count on you to be sensible.\"\n She lifted her arms. \"You\u0027ll have to free my hands.\"\n \"Of course.\" Picking up the controller, he released the shackles on her hands, then offered her the pen again. \"I\u0027ll need your signature here,\" he said, pointing at the bottom of one of the papers. \"And here.\"\n She signed where he indicated. When she was finished, she dropped the pen on the desk.\n Niklaus nodded. \"Thank you, my dear,\" he said, and activated the shackles on her hands.\n \"There\u0027s something you should know,\" Ashlynne said.\n \"Is there?\"\n She nodded. \"I sent a letter to my uncle on Cannus Twelve the night before you left for Hodore.\"\n Niklaus laughed softly. \"Did you?\" He picked up the papers, folded them in half, and put them in the top drawer of his desk. \"Thinking of running away and taking holy vows, were you?\"\n \"No. I told him I was afraid you were going to force me to sign the mine over to you, and that if he heard that I had done so, it would only be because I was in fear for my life. I told him I suspected you were going to kill me. As you know, documents signed under duress are invalid. I told him if he didn\u0027t hear from me as usual, it would mean I was dead.\"\n It was part truth and part lie. She stood there, her hands clenched, hoping Niklaus would believe her.\n Niklaus stared at her, his eyes narrowed, his expression ominous. \"It seems I underestimated you.\" Rounding the desk, he went to the door and opened it. \"Drade, my wife would like to go visit her friend.\"\n \"Well, there\u0027s the house,\" Darf said. \"Now what? We don\u0027t even know if they\u0027re in there.\"\n \"I know.\" They were hunkered down near the front gate of the Hassrick estate. It was after midnight, and there were no lights showing in the house.\n \"Well, do you know how we\u0027re going to get them out?\"\n Falkon shook his head. \"No, but it shouldn\u0027t be too hard for us to get in.\"\n \"I was afraid you\u0027d say something like that,\" Darf muttered sourly.\n \"There\u0027s just one thing wrong with that plan. Once we get in, we might not be able to get out.\"\n \"I\u0027m open to suggestions.\"\n \"I suggest you raise your hands, very slowly.\"\n Darf sighed.\n Falkon swore.\n \"Up,\" Brill said. \"Now.\"\n Slowly, Falkon stood up. He was about to turn around when pain splintered through his skull, and the world went dark.\n He heard voices. Opening his eyes, he blinked against the light.\n \"So,\" a familiar voice said, \"all the players are here.\"\n \"Drade.\"\n Falkon sat up, one hand reaching for the back of his head, only to find that his hands were bound. He stared at the shackles on his wrists. He didn\u0027t have to touch the collar at his throat to know it was there.\n He stared up at his old enemy. \"Where\u0027s Ashlynne?\"\n \"In the dungeon, I believe, with your Cherlin friends.\"\n \"Is she all right?\"\n Drade nodded. \"For now.\"\n \"I want to see her.\"\n Drade chuckled. It was a dry, mirthless sound. \"I\u0027m afraid it doesn\u0027t matter what you want. She\u0027s being sent to the mine in a few days, along\n with the other two.\"\n The mine! Falkon shook his head in disbelief. \"You can\u0027t mean that.\"\n \"It was her husband\u0027s decision.\" He stressed the word husband. \"Not mine.\"\n \"She\u0027s pregnant.\"\n Drade shrugged.\n \"Chaney,\" Falkon said. \"What of Chaney?\"\n \"She\u0027s in labor.\"\n \"Is Hassrick sending the baby to the mine, too?\"\n \"Hardly.\"\n Falkon glanced around, recognizing the hut where he had been imprisoned before.\n Drade stood near the door, a controller in one hand. \"Don\u0027t you want to know what he\u0027s going to do with you?\"\n Falkon grunted softly. \"From the look on your face, I\u0027d say you can\u0027t wait to tell me.\"\n Drade smiled. \"You\u0027re being sent to Cenia. Can you guess why?\"\n Falkon stared at Drade. It took every bit of self-control he possessed to keep the horror growing within him from showing on his face. It was late summer on Cenia, the time when the Cenians sacrificed an enemy warrior and a young virgin to their blood-thirsty gods as an offering to insure success in battle and fertility in their women.\n \"Exactly so,\" Drade said. \"Hassrick has offered you to Brezor. He thought it quite fitting that you be sacrificed with a virgin, since you had stolen one from him.\"\n \"Don\u0027t let him send Ashlynne to the mine.\"\n \"It\u0027s out of my hands.\"\n \"She\u0027ll die there.\"\n A shadow that might have been regret passed through Drade s eyes. \"I believe that is his intent.\"\n \"Dammit, Drade, don\u0027t do this to her. She\u0027s got nothing to do with what\u0027s between the two of us.\"\n \"I told you, it was her husband\u0027s idea. He was not happy to find his bride pregnant by another man.\"\n \"Then change his mind. You\u0027ve manipulated enough people in your life. It should be easy for you.\"\n \"It seems a fair trade to me. The death of the woman you love for the death of the one I loved.\"\n Falkon sprang to his feet. He lunged forward, his bound hands reaching for Drade\u0027s throat, his only thought to choke the life from the bastard who had killed his wife and daughter.\n Too late, he remembered the collar at his throat, the controller in Drade\u0027s hand. With a strangled cry, he dropped to the floor of the hut as shards of pain lanced through him.\n He lay there, gasping and covered with perspiration when it was over.\n \"You always were the impetuous one,\" Drade remarked.\n \"You killed her,\" Falkon said when he could speak. \"Why?\"\n Drade stared down at him. \"What are you talking about?\"\n \"You ordered the attack on my home. Why? You knew I was gone.\"\n Drade shook his head. \"You damn fool. I tried to talk General Ralf out of it, I told him you hadn\u0027t returned to Daccar, but he knew we\u0027d been friends and he didn\u0027t believe me. I got to your place as soon as I could, but I was too late. An hour too late,\" he murmured, his voice laced with bitter regret.\n \"Just one hour too late.\"\n Falkon sat up, his back braced against the wall. Lifting his hands, he wiped the sweat from his face. \"I don\u0027t believe you.\"\n \"Believe what you like,\" Drade snapped. \"But if you had stayed home, where you belonged, she would be alive today.\"\n The truth of Drade\u0027s words penetrated every fiber of his being, more agonizing that the excruciating effects of the collar.\n \"I got there too late,\" Drade said heavily. \"And so did you.\" He stared past Falkon, his thoughts turned inward. \"I loved her,\" he said quietly. \"She should have been mine. They both should have been mine.\"\n Falkon stared at Drade, feeling Drade\u0027s pain as if it were his own. \"Don\u0027t take your hatred for me out on Ashlynne. I\u0027m begging you. Let her go.\"\n \"She\u0027s Hassrick\u0027s wife, and he wants to be rid of her. There\u0027s nothing I can do.\"\n \"Push, Chancy,\" Ashlynne said. \"Push hard.\" Chaney writhed on the narrow cot, her hands grasping the bars behind her head, as she sought to expel the child from her womb.\n \"Relax, my love,\" Darf said. \"Do not fight the pain.\" He stood in the cell across the way, his hands clenched around the bars, his face a mask of concern. Chaney had been in labor for the last seven hours, an unusually long period of time for a Cherlin female.\n \"Chaney, listen to Darf,\" Ashlynne said. She wiped the perspiration from Chaney\u0027s face. \"Try to relax between contractions.\"\n Chaney nodded. She turned her head to the side and focused on her husband\u0027s face.\n \"I love you,\" Darf said. \"Try not to think about the pain. Think about our child. Think of how much I love you.\"\n She nodded, gasping as another pain splintered through her.\n \"I see the head,\" Ashlynne exclaimed. \"Push!\"\n Chaney screamed, pushed, and the head and shoulders emerged.\n A moment later, Ashlynne cradled a tiny furry body in her hands. She looked over at Darf, smiled at Chaney.\n \"It\u0027s a girl.\" She spoke through a mist of tears. Never, she thought, never had she seen anything as miraculous as the infant mewling softly in her arms.\n \"Is she all right?\"\n Ashlynne pulled the blanket from her cot and wrapped it around the baby, then laid the child in Chaney\u0027s arms. \"See for yourself. She\u0027s perfect.\"\n In the way of mothers everywhere, Chaney counted each finger and toe, ran her hand over the tiny furred head and body.\n Ashlynne pressed one hand over her womb as she watched her friend. In a few months, she, too, would be giving birth. Where would she be when the time came? Where would Falkon be? Would they ever be together again? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-captive/page-29.html","bookId":2305,"book":{"id":2305,"title":"The Captive","description":"Storyline: \n Relieved from deadly toil in the mines, a slave is brought to his master\u0027s household to work and there encounters a new form of torture in a seductive young woman who he is forbidden to have.
