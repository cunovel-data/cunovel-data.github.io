{"id":94918,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"The strange restlessness that had plagued her since the day she had visited the mine continued to haunt Ashlynne. Days turned to weeks, the weeks to a month, and with every hour, her sense of unease grew stronger.\n With her parents home, she dared not leave the compound to ride along the beach. It was strictly forbidden. There were dangers outside the compounds protective walls - a chance encounter, however unlikely, with an escaped prisoner; the lure of the jungle, wild and emerald green; the threat of attack by ferocious beasts; the churning riptides along the northern shore.\n She had always avoided the jungle, but the ocean, ever seething, ever changing, called to some primal sense deep within her and she answered whenever she had the chance.\n Her days, once filled with pleasant diversions, now seemed boring. She was tired of reading, tired of playing games and watching vids on the tele- screen, tired of playing the piano. Tired of painting and sculpting.\n Tired of living behind the compound\u0027s high walls. For the first time, it occurred to her that she was as much a prisoner as the slaves who labored in the mine. As much a prisoner as Number Four.\n Number Four. She spent far too much time thinking about him, wondering about him, daydreaming about him. It had to stop.\n She heaved a great sigh as she went to the window and watched the storm rage across the sky. Slender bolts of brilliant white lightning slashed through the roiling thick black clouds. Thunder rumbled in the heavens, vibrating through the earth. Rain pelted the window. The wind howled through the night like an angry, ravenous beast.\n A streak of lightning stabbed through the clouds on the far side of the compound, and a tree burst into flame. It flared for a moment, burning like a giant candle in the darkness, and then the rain snuffed it out.\n The elements were still raging when she climbed into bed. Drawing the covers up to her chin, she closed her eyes. She had always loved the savage unpredictability of the storms on Tierde. Lightning sizzled across the skies, casting eerie dancing shadows on the walls.\n Gradually, the fierce rain lessened to a slow, steady rhythm, which soon lulled her to sleep.\n By morning, the storm had passed, leaving behind a wide swath of destruction. Trees and plants had been uprooted; debris-floated on the surface of the pool. The tree that had been struck by lightning stood like a dark sentinel near the side wall.\n Her parents conferred, then her father called the mine and told Parah to send one of the prisoners to the jinan to clean up the wreckage.\n She wished, but didn\u0027t dare believe; prayed, but expected no answer. It was too much to hope that Parah would send him - Number Four, with his shaggy black hair and cool blue-gray eyes.\n She stood at the back door, one finger tapping restlessly on the wall, her gaze fixed on the side gate. She felt her heart jump into her throat when she saw Number Four enter the yard, followed by Dain. Some prayers, it seemed, were answered after all.\n She stood in the doorway, listening surreptitiously while her father issued his instructions. Number Four was to dig up what was left of the tree that had been struck by lightning and haul it away, and then he was to clean up any other debris left by the storm.\n Excitement bubbled up inside Ashlynne\u0027s stomach as she found a book, grabbed a couple of big yellow apples and headed outside to sit in the sun and read.\n She found a perfect place on a flat rock a few yards away from where Number Four was working. Pretending to be engrossed in the old novel she had hastily pulled off one of the bookshelves in the library, she studied Number Four from beneath the veil of her lashes. She hadn\u0027t realized how tall and broad-shouldered he was. He wore a pair of loose-fitting tan leather breeches and black mud boots, nothing more. His skin was a deep golden brown; each muscle was clearly defined beneath his taut skin. The gash on his cheek had healed, leaving a thin white scar. Sunlight glinted off the thick lynaziam collar at his throat, off the heavy shackles on his wrists. His hair, as black as the baneite crystals he dug out of the mine, fell past his shoulders.\n She had never seen anyone quite like him before. He was beautiful, wild and untamed. Exciting. Forbidden. As dangerous as one of the big black mountain lions she had seen at the circus when she was a little girl. The cats had been prisoners, too, she thought, locked in cages at night, controlled by a collar and leash by day��.\n Falkon listened to his instructions in silence, nodded that he understood. A muscle worked in his jaw as he began shoveling dirt from the base of the fire-ravaged tree. He sent furtive glances at the girl. There was no doubt in his mind that she was the one who had watched him from behind a tree that day at the dock, the same one who had come into his hut and tended his wounds. She was even more beautiful than he remembered. She wore her hair in queenly fashion in a thick coil atop her head. Her skin was the color of pale honey, her cheeks were dusted with a light sprinkling of golden freckles.\n Her eyes, those deep green eyes that had been haunting his dreams, seemed intent on the book in her lap. He recalled the way she had looked at him when she treated his wounds, her expression one of pity and revulsion. Much as a fine lady might look at a wounded cur.\n Rage spiraled through him as he shoveled dirt from the tree\u0027s roots. He was a sky warrior, meant to fly, to fight, not to dig in the earth like a Hodorian slime-worm! Among his own people, he was a hero, treated with honor and respect. He had achieved scores of battle honors, saved dozens of lives at the risk of his own.\n He felt the girl watching him. Did she take pleasure from his captivity, he wondered, in knowing that the fine clothes she wore, the food she ate, everything she possessed, came from the forced labor and misery of others? She was his enemy, as he was hers. No doubt it brought her an enormous sense of satisfaction to watch him toiling in the hot sun.\n Boldly, he lifted his gaze to hers.\n Ashlynne\u0027s senses reeled as Number Four\u0027s impertinent gaze met her own. The hatred in his eyes was almost palpable. She saw him glance at the guard, his thoughts as clear as the words on the book in her lap. Could he kill Dain before Dain activated the collar? And if he managed to kill the guard, how far would he get before they came after him? If he managed to put a good distance between himself and the mine, would the collar still be effective? She held his gaze for a timeless moment, and then she shook her head in silent warning. Though many had tried, no one had ever escaped from the mine. Those who were not caught were usually found dead in the dark green heart of the jungle, their bodies mauled and mangled almost beyond recognition. The ones who were caught were returned to the mine and placed in solitary confinement. One month for a first attempt; two months for the second, and so on. Magny said few men were foolish enough to try to escape a second time.\n He moved so fast, she saw only a blur. Number Four lunged forward, his hands closing around Dain\u0027s throat, and the two men crashed to the ground.\n The controller, knocked from the overseer\u0027s grasp, flew through the air to land inches from where she sat.\n Startled by the speed of Number Four\u0027s attack, Ashlynne jumped to her feet, her book and the remaining apple tumbling to the ground.\n The two men scuffled for several moments, rolling over and over like playful puppies, only they weren\u0027t playing. Number Four drew back his arm and drove his fist into Dain\u0027s face and the guard went limp.\n Breathing heavily, Number Four stood up. Fear washed through Ashlynne when his eyes met hers. Stark, unreasoning fear.\n With a cry, she reached down, scooped up the controller and pointed it at Number Four, her thumb hovering over the activation panel on the top. His blue-gray eyes, as turbulent as a storm-tossed sea, raked over her from head to foot.\n And then he took a step toward her.\n Fear clogged Ashlynne\u0027s throat. Her heart was racing wildly, pounding as if she had been running for miles. He didn\u0027t look exciting and mysterious now, only savage and ferocious and completely untamed. The sun glistened on his sweat-sheened flesh, glinted on the thick collar at his throat.\n \"Lady Ashlynne!\"\n She glanced past Number Four to see Dain struggling to his feet. Number Four took another menacing step toward her and she tossed the controller to Dain, who caught it in mid-air and quickly applied pressure to the top of the control panel.\n The effect was immediate.\n A hoarse cry erupted from the prisoner\u0027s throat as the collar was activated, a harsh rasping cry that seemed torn from the very depths of his soul.\n Caught in the inescapable grasp of the collar\u0027s power, Number Four dropped heavily to the ground, writhing in an agony she could not begin to imagine, his body twisting, thrashing helplessly in a vain attempt to escape the pain that engulfed him.\n Ashlynne had been told the pain was akin to being severely shocked over and over again.\n She watched in horror as Number Four\u0027s body convulsed, his muscles bunching, quivering. Sweat oozed from every pore. Once begun, there was no way to end the punishment until it had run its course. Moments passed, each one seeming an eternity as she watched. Spasms coursed through him, his face was contorted in a harsh mask of agony.\n She bit down on her lower lip, wishing there was a way to end his suffering. She had never seen the effects of the collar before; she hoped never to see them again.\n Gradually, the punishment diminished, then ceased. Number Four lay on the ground, gasping for breath, his knees drawn up to his chest, his body drenched with perspiration, his eyes tightly closed. His muscles continued to twitch convulsively.\n She flinched as Dain kicked Number Four in the back.\n \"Get up!\" the overseer ordered curtly. \"You\u0027ve still got work to do.\" A cruel grin twisted Dain\u0027s thick lips as he watched the prisoner struggle to his hands and knees. \"A month in the hole should cool that temper of yours.\"\n Falkon stood up, swaying unsteadily. He felt weak, drained. Every muscle in his body ached.\n \"Get back to work.\" Dain held the controller in his right hand. For all the pain it caused, the controller left no lasting ill effects. It was a remarkably effective instrument. He had worked in the mine for ten years and in all that time, he had never had to punish the same slave twice. It was a lesson learned once, but learned well.\n Picking up the shovel Number Four had dropped, Dain thrust it into his hands. \"Move it.\"\n Jaw clenched in silent protest, Falkon took the shovel and turned back to the task at hand. He could feel the woman watching him, her eyes burning into his back. Damn her! Damn them all! The earth was hard and unyielding. The punishment had left him feeling weak and a little light-headed. He cursed viciously under his breath, his pride in shreds. It was humiliating enough to be a slave without her standing there, watching him writhing in agony in the dirt, helpless as a worm squirming on a hot rock.\n Why the hell didn\u0027t she go back into the house where she belonged? Time and again, he thrust the shovel into the earth, wishing the tool was a weapon, wishing that it was Drade at his feet. At last, he exposed the tree\u0027s roots. He was panting heavily now, plagued by a relentless thirst.\n Dain picked up his communicator and called the mine office. \"Dagan? I need a couple of men up here to haul this tree away.\" He paused a moment, his gaze never leaving the prisoner. \"Right. We\u0027ll be there in a few minutes.\n Out.\"\n With a mocking grin, Dain touched the left side of the controller, activating the magnets within the heavy lynaziam shackles on the prisoner\u0027s wrists. The bands snapped together with a sharp click.\n \"Let\u0027s go,\" Dain said, jerking his head toward the path. \"The hole awaits.\"\n Eyes forward, Falkon started down the path that led to the mine compound. He refused to look at the girl, but he could feel her gaze on his\n back, knew she was watching him with those enormous green eyes.\n He cursed her all the way down the hill.\n Solitary confinement. Falkon squatted in a corner of the hole, his head resting against the damp dirt wall at his back, his eyes closed. He had thought his cell the worst kind of prison, but he had been wrong. This was worse. Much worse.\n It was a hole he had dug himself. A rough square, four feet wide, four feet deep. They had stripped him of his boots and breeches and ordered him inside, then covered the hole with a canopy made of thick ebonywood. A narrow slit in one corner allowed him just enough air to breathe. The earth beneath his feet was damp and cold.\n It was like being buried alive.\n They opened the hole once each day, just long enough to pass him a loaf of dark brown bread, a bowl of weak broth, and a cup of sour wine, and then he was left with his own company again, his own dismal thoughts.\n By the end of the first week, he could scarcely tolerate his own stink. The air in the hole reeked of excrement and sweat. During the day, he spent hours staring at the narrow ribbon of light that filtered through the slit in the wood. The sun pounding down on the thick black wood turned the hole into an oven. Sweat dripped down his body to puddle at his feet. The collar and manacles chafed his skin. At night, he huddled into a corner, his body shivering convulsively in an effort to warm itself.\n The close confines of the hole pressed in on him. He stared into the darkness that surrounded him, his hatred for the overseers, for the mine owners, for Drade, growing until he thought he might choke on it.\n In his imagination, he killed them all over and over again, devising new methods of torture, of execution. His favorite was to put them in the hole he now occupied and leave them to rot. All of them. The overseers. The couple who owned the mine, who now owned him, body and soul. Their servants.\n Their daughter, with her long silver-blond hair and eyes as green as the oceans of Daccar. Ashlynne.\n He muttered an oath, and then he swore aloud, unleashing a long string of the most foul profanity he knew.\n They let him out of the hole for ten minutes each week so he could remove the pile of excrement from the corner. But he could not remove the stink. Not from the earth that surrounded him on all sides. Not from his skin.\n It was humiliating, degrading, to be forced to squat in that fetid hole like some sort of dung beast, blind and dumb and helpless. He prayed for his freedom, for a weapon, for vengeance. Always for vengeance. And the hatred grew within him, taking root deep in his heart, choking the life from his soul.\n There was no peace for him now, save in his dreams, vivid dreams haunted by a silver-haired maiden with soft, creamy skin and luminous green eyes. Ashlynne�� \"It was awful, Magny. I\u0027ve never seen anything so terrible in my whole life.\"\n Magny nodded, her brown eyes sympathetic, yet alight with interest. \"I heard Dain talking to my father about it. Were you scared?\"\n \"Terrified. He looked so�� so dangerous.\"\n \"Number Four. He\u0027s��\" A flush tinged Magny\u0027s cheeks. \"He\u0027s handsome, isn\u0027t he, Lynnie?\"\n \"What difference does that make?\" Ashlynne exclaimed, horrified to hear her own thoughts put into words. \"He\u0027s a slave.\"\n \"But handsome, don\u0027t you think?\"\n \"Well, yes,\" Ashlynne admitted. \"He is that.\"\n \"I saw him the other day.\" Magny fell back on the bed, her arms spread wide. \"My oh my, what a man.\"\n Ashlynne shook her head. Magny was her best friend, but sometimes she just didn\u0027t understand her. Of course, Magny led a much freer life than Ashlynne. Magny had been to Enjine Base Nine several times; she had once confided to Ashlynne that she\u0027d had an affair with a sky pilot from Riga Twelve, and that she still saw him whenever he came to Tierde. Sometimes Ashlynne envied her friend her freedom, but then she would think how awful it would be to have to live in the mine compound, surrounded by ugliness and condemned men. Magny\u0027s mother had left Tierde when Magny was only five, declaring she could no longer abide living there. She had promised to send for Magny when she found a place to live, but she never had. It was a subject she and Ashlynne never discussed.\n Ashlynne picked up a comb and ran it through her hair. \"What did they do to him? For attacking Dain?\"\n \"He\u0027s in solitary.\" Magny sat up and ran a hand through her own hair, wishing it was long and thick and silver-blond like Ashlynne\u0027s, instead of short and impossibly curly.\n \"Oh. What is that, exactly?\" Ashlynne asked, thinking it was probably like being locked in a closet or something. But as Magny began to describe it, Ashlynne realized it was far worse than anything she had imagined. What would it be like, to be confined to a hole in the ground, unable to stand up? \"And he has to stay down there, naked, in that hole, for a whole month.\"\n Magny wrinkled her nose. \"It\u0027s awful. You can\u0027t imagine the smell. They let him out for a few minutes every week so he can muck out the hole.\" Magny shuddered as she grabbed an apple from the bowl beside Ashlynne\u0027s bed.\n \"He\u0027s all right, though?\"\n Magny lifted a knowing brow. \"Worried about him, are you, Lynnie dear?\"\n \"Of course not,\" Ashlynne said quickly.\n \"Uh huh. Then I guess you won\u0027t care that Dain beat him again.\"\n \"He did? Oh, Magny, why?\"\n \"You know Dain. He doesn\u0027t need a reason. Let\u0027s talk about something more pleasant, shall we? I hear you\u0027re meeting Niklaus soon.\"\n Ashlynne nodded. \"Yes. I have to go to Trellis this summer. To meet him and his family, and discuss the wedding.\"\n \"Are your parents going?\"\n \"No. Father said he can\u0027t leave the mine that long.\"\n \"Well, why doesn\u0027t Niklaus come here?\"\n \"For the same reason. He can\u0027t leave. And since he can\u0027t come to me, I have to go to him.\"\n She pointed at the picture of Niklaus on her dressing table. \"How can I marry a man I don\u0027t even know?\"\n \"Well, isn\u0027t that why you\u0027re going to Trellis? To get to know him?\"\n \"Well, yes. But do you think one summer is long enough to get to know a man well enough to marry him?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know, but I think he\u0027s dreamy,\" Magny said. \"And just think of it, you\u0027ll finally get off this rock. You\u0027re so lucky.\"\n \"Lucky?\" Ashlynne studied Niklaus\u0027s photograph. He was a handsome man, with wavy brown hair, brown eyes, a patrician nose. And yet, handsome as he was, she thought Number Four far more�� not handsome, exactly, but there was something about him, something virile and extremely masculine that was lacking in Niklaus. \"Would you want to marry a man you\u0027ve never met?\"\n \"I\u0027d marry a Hordorian swine merchant if he could get me away from here,\" Magny declared. She tossed the apple core into the disposal unit and fell back on the bed again, her hands clasped behind her head. \"Think of it, Lynnie, you\u0027ll get to travel to the far side of the galaxy, live in a big house, have anything you want.\"\n \"I already live in a big house,\" Ashlynne retorted. And she had almost everything she wanted. Except the freedom to marry whom she wished, when she wished.\n \"Well, if you don\u0027t want to marry Niklaus, I will,\" Magny said.\n \"What about your sky pilot?\"\n \"Well, he\u0027s very exciting, but he\u0027ll never be rich.\"\n \"Wouldn\u0027t you rather marry for love than for money?\"\n \"I suppose so.\"\n \"Oh, Mag, I don\u0027t want to get married and move to Trellis. I don\u0027t want to leave here.\"\n \"Why ever not?\"\n Ashlynne bit down on her lower lip. She had never lived anywhere else, never been anywhere else. She was afraid to leave the security of the only home she had ever known. But even that wasn\u0027t the real reason. She didn\u0027t want to marry Niklaus; she wanted to stay here, because he was here. But she couldn\u0027t tell Magny that.\n \"Do you think Number Four is the monster they say he is?\"\n Ashlynne looked up, startled. \"What?\"\n \"Number Four. Do you think he\u0027s as bad as everyone says?\"\n Ashlynne stared at Magny, wondering if her friend had been reading her mind, if Magny knew how obsessed she had become with Number Four. She thought about him constantly, dreamed of him at night.\n \"What difference does it make?\" she asked, though she had often wondered the same thing herself. \"He\u0027s a slave.\"\n \"I know.\" Magny sighed dramatically. \"But have you seen his arms? I\u0027ve never seen muscles like that. Don\u0027t you wonder what it would be like to have him hold you?\"\n \"Magny!\" Ashlynne exclaimed. She tried to look horrified, but failed miserably. She had wondered. Even though he was a slave, even though she hated him because he was rude and crude and insolent, she had noticed that he was a fine specimen of a man, and it embarrassed her. \"Why did Dain beat him?\"\n Magny shook her head. \"You know Dain. He has no patience. He ordered\n Number Four out of the hole, and Number Four didn\u0027t obey quickly enough.\n As soon as Number Four climbed out, Dain started whipping him. Dain enjoys inflicting pain far too much, I think.\"\n \"But he\u0027s all right?\"\n \"Who?\" Magny asked, stifling a giggle. \"Dain?\"\n Ashlynne picked up a pillow and threw it at her friend. \"You know who.\"\n Magny caught the pillow in both hands and hugged it to her chest. \"Oh, you mean Number Four. He\u0027s amazing,\" Magny said, her voice tinged with awe. \"He just stood there, his hands clenched, while blood dripped down his back. You could see Dain getting madder by the minute. I don\u0027t know what he would have done if my father hadn\u0027t stepped in and put a stop to it. He took Dain aside later and reprimanded him. He told Dain if he caught him whipping a slave for no reason again, he\u0027d lose his position.\"\n \"I\u0027ve never liked him,\" Ashlynne said. \"He has sneaky eyes.\"\n Magny swung her legs over the edge of the bed. \"Well,\" she said with an exaggerated sigh, \"I\u0027ve got to go fix dinner for my father.\" Rising, she dropped the pillow on the bed and headed toward the door. \"If I see Number Four, I\u0027ll be sure to extend your regards.\"\n \"Mag!\" Ashlynne called, running down the corridor after her friend. \"Mag, don\u0027t you dare! Mag!\"\n \"Can\u0027t catch me!\" Magny ran out the front door and sprinted for the path that led to the mine.\n \"Magny! I\u0027ll never speak to you again!\"\n \"Yes, you will. Bye, Lynnie,\" Magny shouted, and disappeared out the gate. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-captive/page-3.html","bookId":2305,"book":{"id":2305,"title":"The Captive","description":"Storyline: \n Relieved from deadly toil in the mines, a slave is brought to his master\u0027s household to work and there encounters a new form of torture in a seductive young woman who he is forbidden to have.
