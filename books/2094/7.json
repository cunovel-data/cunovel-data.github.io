There were some sayings, though, that he could neither leave out nor alter, because they caused such a stir among the disciples and among the crowds that came to listen wherever Jesus went. Everyone knew what he had said, and many people talked about his words; it would be noticed if they were not in the record.\\n\\n Many of these sayings concerned children and the family, and some of them cut Christ to the quick. Once, on the road to Capernaum, the disciples were arguing. Jesus had heard their raised voices, but was walking apart from them and didn\u0027t hear what they were saying.\\n\\n When they went into the house where they were to stay he said:\\n\\n \u0027What were you arguing about on the way?\u0027\\n\\n They fell silent, because they were embarrassed. Finally one of them said:\\n\\n \u0027We were discussing which of us was the most important, master.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Were you, indeed. Come around here, all of you.\u0027\\n\\n They stood in front of him. Now in that house there was a little child, and Jesus picked him up and showed him to the disciples.\\n\\n \u0027Whoever wants to be first,\u0027 he said, \u0027must be last of all and servant of all. Unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the Kingdom of heaven. Whoever becomes as humble as this child will be the most important in heaven. And whoever welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me.\u0027\\n\\n Another time, Jesus had stopped to sit down, and people brought their little children to him to be blessed.\\n\\n \u0027Not now!\u0027 the disciples said. \u0027Go away! The master is resting.\u0027\\n\\n Jesus heard them, and was angry.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t speak to these good people like that,\u0027 he said. \u0027Let them bring their children here. Who else do you think the Kingdom of God is for? It belongs to them.\u0027\\n\\n The disciples stood aside, and the people carried their children to Jesus, who blessed them, and took them in his arms, and kissed them.\\n\\n Speaking to his disciples as well as to the parents of the children, he said, \u0027You should all be like little children when it comes to the Kingdom, otherwise you will never enter it. So be careful. Whoever makes it difficult for one of these little ones to come to me, it would be better for them if a millstone were hung about their neck and they were drowned in the depths of the sea.\u0027\\n\\n Christ noted down the words, admiring the vigour of the imagery while regretting the thinking behind it; because if it were true that only children could be admitted to the Kingdom, what was the value of such adult qualities as responsibility, forethought, and wisdom? Surely the Kingdom would need those as well.\\n\\n On another occasion, some Pharisees tried to test Jesus by asking about divorce. Jesus had spoken about that subject in his sermon on the mountain, but they had spotted what they thought was a contradiction in what he had said.\\n\\n \u0027Is divorce lawful?\u0027 they said.\\n\\n \u0027Haven\u0027t you read the scriptures?\u0027 was Jesus\u0027s reply. \u0027Don\u0027t you remember how the Lord God made Adam and Eve male and female, and declared that a man should leave his father and his mother and join his wife, and the two of them shall become one flesh? Had you forgotten that? So no one should separate what God has joined together.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 they said, \u0027then why did Moses make his specification about a certificate of divorce? He would not have done that if God had forbidden it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027God tolerates it now, but did he institute it in Eden? Was there any need for divorce then? No. Man and woman then were created to live perfectly together. It was only after the coming of sin that divorce became necessary. And when the Kingdom comes, as it will, and men and women live together perfectly once more, there will be no need for divorce.\u0027\\n\\n The Sadducees also tried to trick Jesus with a problem concerning marriage. Now the Sadducees didn\u0027t believe in resurrection or an afterlife, and they thought they could get the better of Jesus by asking him a question about that.\\n\\n \u0027If a man dies without having children,\u0027 they said, \u0027it\u0027s the custom for his brother to marry the widow, and beget children for him. Is that not so?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That is the custom,\u0027 said Jesus.\\n\\n \u0027Well, now: suppose there are seven brothers. The first marries, and dies childless, so the widow marries the second brother. The same thing happens again: the husband dies childless, and she marries the next, all the way down to the seventh brother. Then the woman herself dies. So ¨C when the dead are resurrected, whose wife will she be? Because she\u0027s married all of them.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re wrong,\u0027 said Jesus. \u0027You don\u0027t know the scriptures, and you don\u0027t know the power of God. When the dead are resurrected they will neither marry nor be given in marriage. They\u0027ll live like the angels. As for the resurrection of the dead, you forget what God said to Moses when he spoke from the burning bush. He said, \"I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.\" Would he have spoken in the present tense if they were not alive? He is not the God of the dead; he is the God of the living.\u0027\\n\\n The Sadducees had to retreat, confounded.\\n\\n Jesus and the Family\\n\\n But for all Jesus\u0027s defence of marriage, and of children, he had little to say in favour of the family, or of comfortable prosperity. On one occasion he said to a crowd of people who wanted to follow him, \u0027If you don\u0027t hate your father and your mother, your brothers and sisters, your wife, your children, you\u0027ll never become my disciple.\u0027 And Christ remembered Jesus\u0027s words when he\u0027d been told that his mother and brothers and sisters had come to see him: he had rejected them, and claimed that he had no family except those who did the will of God. To hear his brother speak of hating one\u0027s family worried Christ; he would not have chosen to write those words, but too many people had heard Jesus say them.\\n\\n Then one day in Christ\u0027s hearing Jesus told a story that disturbed him more greatly still.\\n\\n \u0027There was a man who had two sons, one quiet and good, the other wild and unruly. The wild one said to his father, \"Father, you\u0027re going to divide the property between us anyway; let me have my share now.\" The father did, and the wild son went away to another country, and squandered all his money in drink and gambling and debauchery, until he had nothing left.\\n\\n \u0027Then there came a famine in the country where he was living, and the wild son found himself in such desperate need that he hired himself out as a swineherd. He was so hungry that he would have been glad to be able to eat the husks that the pigs were eating. In his despair he thought of his home, and said to himself, \"At home there are my father\u0027s hired hands, and every one of them has all the bread he wants, and to spare; and here I am, dying of hunger. I\u0027ll go home and confess to my father and beg his forgiveness, and ask him to take me on as a hired hand.\"\\n\\n \u0027So he set off towards home, and when his father heard he was coming he was filled with compassion, and he hurried out of the town to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him. The son said, \"Father, I\u0027ve sinned against heaven and I\u0027ve sinned against you; I don\u0027t deserve to be called your son. Just let me work for you like one of the hired hands.\"\\n\\n \u0027But the father said to the servants, \"Bring out the best robe, and some sandals for my son\u0027s feet, and hurry! And prepare a feast ¨C the best of everything ¨C because this dear son of mine was dead, and here he is alive again; he was lost, and now he\u0027s found!\"\\n\\n \u0027But the other son, the quiet one, the good one, heard the sounds of celebration and saw what was going on, and said to his father:\\n\\n \u0027\"Father, why are you preparing a feast for him? I have been at home all the time, I have never disobeyed your commands, and yet you\u0027ve never prepared a feast for me. My brother walked away without thinking of the rest of us, he squandered all his money, he has no thought for his family or anyone else.\"\\n\\n \u0027And the father said, \"Son, you\u0027re at home all the time. All that I have is yours. But when someone comes home after being away, it\u0027s right and proper to prepare a feast in celebration. And your brother was dead, and he\u0027s come to life again; he was lost, and he\u0027s been found.\"\u0027\\n\\n When Christ heard that story, he felt as if he had been stripped naked in front of the whole crowd. He had no idea that his brother had seen him there, but he must have done, in order to mortify him so exquisitely. All Christ could hope was that no one had noticed, and he resolved to keep even more discreetly to the background in future.\\n\\n Difficult Stories\\n\\n Not long afterwards, Jesus told another story that seemed to Christ unfair. Nor was he the only listener to react like that: many people could not understand it at all, and discussed it with one another afterwards. Someone had asked Jesus what the Kingdom of heaven would be like, and he said:\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s like a farmer who went out early in the morning to hire labourers for his vineyard. He struck a deal with them for the usual daily wage, and they set to work. A couple of hours later he was passing through the market place and he saw some other workers standing idle, and he said, \"You want a job? Go to my vineyard and I\u0027ll pay you whatever\u0027s fair.\" Off they went, and he went on his way, and then came past again at noon, and then once more halfway through the afternoon, and each time saw some other men standing about, and said the same to them.\\n\\n \u0027Finally, about five o\u0027clock, he came through the market one more time, saw another group there, and said, \"Why are you standing idle all day long?\"\\n\\n \u0027\"No one has hired us,\" they said. So he hired them on the same terms.\\n\\n \u0027When it was evening, he said to his manager, \"Call the men to come and get their pay, starting with the last, and then going back to the first.\"\\n\\n \u0027When the five o\u0027clock workers came, he gave them each a full day\u0027s wage, as he did to all the others. The workers who had been hired in the early morning grumbled about this, and said, \"You\u0027re giving these men, who\u0027ve only worked for one hour, the same as us, who\u0027ve been labouring all day in the scorching heat?\"\\n\\n \u0027The farmer said, \"My friend, you agreed to accept a day\u0027s wages for a day\u0027s work, and that\u0027s exactly what you\u0027ve got. Take what you\u0027ve earned, and go. Aren\u0027t I entitled to do whatever I choose with what belongs to me? Because I choose to be good-natured, should that make you ill-natured?\"\u0027\\n\\n Another story that Jesus told was even harder for his listeners to understand, but Christ wrote it down for the stranger in the hope that he could explain it.\\n\\n \u0027There was a rich farmer who had a manager to look after his business, and complaints began to come to him about the way this man was dealing with his affairs. So he called the manager to come and see him, and said, \"I\u0027ve been hearing things about you that I don\u0027t like. I\u0027m going to dismiss you, but first I want a full account of everything that\u0027s owed to me.\"\\n\\n \u0027And the manager thought, \"What in the world am I going to do now? I\u0027m not strong enough for manual labour, and I\u0027m ashamed to beg... \" So he came up with a plan to ensure that other people would look after him when he was out of work.\\n\\n \u0027He called his employer\u0027s debtors to him one by one. He asked the first one, \"How much do you owe my employer?\" and the man said, \"A hundred jars of oil.\" \"Sit down quickly,\" said the manager, \"take your account, and write fifty instead.\"\\n\\n \u0027To the next one he said, \"How much do you owe?\" \"A hundred bushels of wheat.\" \"Here\u0027s your account. Cross out a hundred, and make it eighty.\"\\n\\n \u0027And he did the same with the rest of the debtors. Now, what did the master say when he heard about this? Whatever you think, you\u0027re wrong. What he did was to commend the dishonest manager for his shrewdness.\u0027\\n\\n What Jesus seemed to be saying with these stories, Christ thought, was something horrible: that God\u0027s love was arbitrary and undeserved, almost like a lottery. Jesus\u0027s friendship with tax-collectors and prostitutes and other undesirable characters must also have been part of this radical attitude; he seemed to have a real scorn for what was commonly thought of as virtue. He once told a story about two men, a Pharisee and a tax-collector, who both went to the temple to pray. The Pharisee stood by himself looking up to heaven and said, \u0027God, I thank you that I\u0027m not like other men, a thief, an adulterer, a swindler, or like that tax-collector over there. I fast twice a week, and I give away a tenth of my income.\u0027 But the tax-collector didn\u0027t dare to look up; he kept his eyes down and beat his breast, saying, \u0027God, I beg you, be merciful to me, a sinner.\u0027 And this, and not the other, Jesus told his listeners, was the man who would enter the Kingdom.\\n\\n It was a popular message, no doubt; the common people delighted to hear about men and women such as themselves winning undeserved success. But it troubled Christ, and he longed to ask the stranger about it.\\n\\n The Stranger Transfigured; A Coming Crisis\\n\\n He soon had his chance. As he walked one evening beside the Sea of Galilee, thinking he was alone, he found the stranger beside him.\\n\\n He was startled, and said, \u0027Sir! I didn\u0027t see you. Forgive me for not greeting you ¨C had you been beside me for some time? My thoughts were elsewhere.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I am always close to you,\u0027 said the stranger, and they fell into step and walked along together.\\n\\n \u0027When we spoke last,\u0027 said Christ, \u0027you said that next time we would talk about my brother.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And so we shall. What is his future, do you think?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027His future ¨C I can\u0027t tell, sir. He\u0027s stirring up a good deal of animosity. I worry that if he\u0027s not careful he might meet the same fate as John, the Baptist, or else provoke the Romans as the Zealots are doing.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But is he careful?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. I\u0027d say he was reckless. But to him, you see, the Kingdom of God is coming very soon, and it makes no sense to be cautious and prudent.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027To him, you say? You mean you don\u0027t think he\u0027s right? This is just a guess of his, and he might be mistaken?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not quite that,\u0027 said Christ. \u0027I think we have a difference of emphasis. I believe the Kingdom is coming, of course I do. But he thinks it will come without warning, because God is impulsive and arbitrary. That\u0027s at the root of it.\u0027\\n\\n He told the stranger the parables that had troubled him.\\n\\n \u0027I see,\u0027 said the stranger. \u0027And you? What do you think of God?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think he is just. Virtue must play some part in whether we are rewarded or punished, or else why be virtuous? What the law and the prophets say ¨C what Jesus himself says ¨C doesn\u0027t make sense otherwise. It\u0027s just not consistent.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can see how it must trouble you.\u0027\\n\\n They walked on a little way in silence.\\n\\n \u0027And besides,\u0027 said Christ, \u0027there is the matter of the Gentiles.\u0027\\n\\n He left it there, to see how his companion would respond. If, as he thought, the man was Greek, he would naturally be interested.\\n\\n But the stranger merely said, \u0027Go on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 said Christ, \u0027Jesus preaches only to the Jews. He\u0027s said clearly that Gentiles are dogs, for example. It was on the scrolls I gave you last time.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I remember. But you don\u0027t agree?\u0027\\n\\n Christ was aware that if this man had come to tempt him into rash words, this was exactly the way he would do it: lead him by soft questions.\\n\\n \u0027Again, sir,\u0027 he said carefully, \u0027I think it\u0027s a matter of emphasis. I know that the Jews are the beloved people of God ¨C the scripture says that. And yet God surely created the Gentiles too, and there are good men and women among them. Whatever form the Kingdom may take, it will surely be a new dispensation, and it would not be surprising, given the infinite mercy and justice of God, to find his love extending to the Gentiles... But these mysteries are deep, and I may be wrong. I wish, sir, you would tell me what the truth is. It lies beyond time, as you told me, but my knowledge is lacking, and my vision clouded.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come with me,\u0027 said the stranger. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-good-man-jesus-and-the-scoundrel-christ-canongate-myth-16/page-7.html","bookId":2094,"book":{"id":2094,"title":"The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ (Canongate Myth #16)","description":"Storyline: The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ (Canongate Myths #16) \\n The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ is a novel by Philip Pullman.
