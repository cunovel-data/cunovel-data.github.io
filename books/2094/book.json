Published at Easter 2010 by Canongate Books, it tells the story of Jesus as if he were two people, \"Jesus\" and \"Christ,\" with contrasting personalities; Jesus being a moral and godly man, and his brother Christ a calculating figure who wishes to use Jesus\u0027 legacy to found a powerful Church. The book has attracted controversy, as well as hate mail sent to Pullman by Christian fundamentalists threatening him with damnation. Pullman\u0027s historical understanding has been criticised by Professor Gerald O\u0027Collins. Diarmaid MacCulloch reviewed the book positively for Literary Review.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-good-man-jesus-and-the-scoundrel-christ-canongate-myth-16.jpg","author":"Philip Pullman","type":"Fantasy","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":15,"category":{"id":18,"name":"Fantasy","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
