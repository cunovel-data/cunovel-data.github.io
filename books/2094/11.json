{"id":90328,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\u0027He also said he\u0027d come not to bring peace, but a sword.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027When did he say that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That was in Capernaum, not long after Matthew joined us. Jesus was telling us what to do when we went out to preach. He said, \"Don\u0027t think I\u0027ve come to bring peace to the earth. I haven\u0027t come to bring peace, but a sword. I\u0027ve come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and your enemies will be members of your own household.\"\u0027\\n\\n Christ wrote it down just as the apostle told him.\\n\\n \u0027That sounds exactly like the sort of thing he\u0027d come out with,\u0027 he said. \u0027Did he say anything else?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He said, \"Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.\" There\u0027s some of us thinking of those words again now.\u0027\\n\\n The Stranger Tells Christ What Part He Must Play\\n\\n The man said goodbye, and hastened back to his companions. Christ went to his room to transcribe the words on to a scroll, and then he knelt down, intending to pray for strength to withstand the test that was to come.\\n\\n But he hadn\u0027t been praying for long before there came a knock on the door. Knowing who it was, he got up and let the angel in.\\n\\n The angel greeted him with a kiss.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m ready, sir,\u0027 said Christ. \u0027Is it tonight?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We have a little time to talk first. Sit, and take some wine.\u0027\\n\\n Christ poured some wine for himself, and for the angel, too, knowing that angels had eaten and drunk with Abraham and Sarah.\\n\\n \u0027Sir, since I am not going to be here for long,\u0027 said Christ, \u0027will you answer a question I\u0027ve put to you more than once, and tell me who you are and where you come from?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I thought we had come to trust each other, you and I?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I have given my life into your hands. All I ask is a little knowledge in return.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is not the first occasion on which your faith has failed.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you know about the other occasion, sir, you will know how much I lamented it. I would give anything to live that night again. But haven\u0027t I done faithfully everything you\u0027ve asked of me? Haven\u0027t I written a true record of my brother\u0027s life and words? And now, haven\u0027t I assented to the role you told me of last time we spoke? I am ready to play the part of Isaac. I\u0027m ready to give my life for the Kingdom, and atone for the time when my faith was needed, and when it failed. Sir, let me plead with you: I beg you, tell me more. Otherwise I shall go out of my life in darkness.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I told you that this task would be difficult. The part of Isaac is easy; it\u0027s the part of Abraham that is hard. You are not to die. You are to give Jesus to the authorities. He is the one who will die.\u0027\\n\\n Christ was astounded.\\n\\n \u0027Betray my brother? When I love him as I do?\\n\\n I could never do that! Sir, that\u0027s too hard! I beg you, don\u0027t ask this of me!\u0027\\n\\n In his distraction, Christ got up and beat his hands together and struck his head. Then he fell to the floor and clasped the angel\u0027s knees.\\n\\n \u0027Let me die in his place, I beg you!\u0027 he cried. \u0027We look similar ¨C no one will know ¨C he can continue his work! What am I doing except keeping a record? Anyone could do that! My informant is a good and honest man ¨C he could write it ¨C he would be well placed to continue the history I\u0027ve begun ¨C you don\u0027t need me to live! All my life I have been trying to serve my brother, and now, when I thought I could do him the greatest service of all by dying in his place, are you going to rob me of it by making me betray him instead? Don\u0027t bring me to this! I can\u0027t do it, I can\u0027t; let it pass me by!\u0027\\n\\n The angel stroked Christ\u0027s hair.\\n\\n \u0027Sit up now,\u0027 he said, \u0027and I shall tell you a little of what\u0027s been hidden.\u0027\\n\\n Christ wiped his tears and tried to compose himself.\\n\\n \u0027The truth of everything I say is already known to you,\u0027 the stranger began. \u0027You have said much of it to Jesus in your own words. You told him that people needed miracles and signs; you told him of the importance of dramatic events in persuading them to believe. He didn\u0027t listen, because he thought that the Kingdom was coming so soon that no persuasion would be necessary. And again, you urged him to accept the existence of what we have agreed to call the church. He scoffed at the idea. But he was wrong, and you were right. Without miracles, without a church, without a scripture, the power of his words and his deeds will be like water poured into the sand. It dampens the sand for a moment, and then the sun comes and dries it, and after a minute there\u0027s no sign that it\u0027s ever been there. Even the history that you\u0027ve begun to write so meticulously, with such diligence and care for the truth, even that will be scattered like dry leaves and forgotten. In another generation the name of Jesus will mean nothing, and neither will the name Christ. How many healers and exorcists and preachers are there walking the roads of Palestine? Dozens and dozens. Every one will be forgotten, and so will Jesus. Unless-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But the Kingdom,\u0027 said Christ, \u0027the Kingdom will come!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said the angel, \u0027there will be no Kingdom in this world. You were right about that as well.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I never denied the Kingdom!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You did. When you described the church, you spoke as if the Kingdom would not come about without it. And you were right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, no! I said that if God wanted to, he could bring the Kingdom about just by lifting a finger.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But God does not want to. God wants the church to be an image of the Kingdom. Perfection does not belong here; we can only have an image of perfection. Jesus, in his purity, is asking too much of people. We know they\u0027re not perfect, as he wishes them to be; we have to adjust ourselves to what they are. You see, the true Kingdom would blind human beings like the sun, but they need an image of it all the same. And that is what the church will be. My dear Christ,\u0027 the stranger went on, leaning forward, \u0027human life is difficult; there are profundities and compromises and mysteries that look to the innocent eye like betrayal. Let the wise men of the church bear those burdens, because there are plenty of other burdens for the faithful to carry. There are children to educate, there are the sick to nurse, there are the hungry to feed. The body of the faithful will do all these things, fearlessly, selflessly, ceaselessly, and it will do more, because there are other needs as well. There is the desire for beauty and music and art; and that is a hunger that is a double blessing to assuage, because the things that satisfy it are not consumed, but go on to nourish everyone who hungers for them, again and again for ever. The church you describe will inspire all these things, and provide them in full measure. And there is the noble passion for knowledge and inquiry, for philosophy, for the most royal study of the nature and mystery of divinity itself. Under the guidance and protection of the church, all these human needs from the most common and physical to the most rare and spiritual will be satisfied again and again, and every covenant will be fulfilled. The church will not be the Kingdom, because the Kingdom is not of this world; but it will be a foreshadowing of the Kingdom, and the one sure way to reach it.\\n\\n \u0027But only ¨C only ¨C if at the centre of it is the ever-living presence of a man who is both a man and more than a man, a man who is also God and the word of God, a man who dies and is brought to life again. Without that, the church will wither and perish, an empty husk, like every other human structure that lives for a moment and then dies and blows away.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What are you saying? What is this? Brought to life again?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If he does not come to life again, then nothing will be true. If he doesn\u0027t rise from his grave, the faith of countless millions yet unborn will die in the womb, and that is a grave from which nothing will rise. I told you how truth is not history, and comes from outside time, and comes into the darkness like a light. This is that truth. It\u0027s a truth that will make everything true. It\u0027s a light that will lighten the world.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But will it happen?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Such stubbornness! Such hardness of heart! Yes, it will happen, if you believe in it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you know how weak my faith is! I couldn\u0027t even... You know what I couldn\u0027t do.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We are discussing truth, not history,\u0027 the angel reminded him. \u0027You may live history, but you must write truth.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s in history that I want to see him rise again.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then believe.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And if I can\u0027t?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then think of an orphan child, lost and cold and starving. Think of a sick man, racked with pain and fear. Think of a dying woman terrified by the coming darkness. There will be hands reaching out to comfort them and feed them and warm them, there will be voices of kindness and reassurance, there will be soft beds and sweet hymns and consolation and joy. All those kindly hands and sweet voices will do their work so willingly because they know that one man died and rose again, and that this truth is enough to cancel out all the evil in the world.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Even if it never happened.\u0027\\n\\n The angel said nothing.\\n\\n Christ waited for a response, but none came. So he said, \u0027I can see now. It\u0027s better that one man should die than that all these good things should never come about. That\u0027s what you\u0027re saying. If I\u0027d known it would come to this, I wonder if I\u0027d ever have listened to you in the first place. And I\u0027m not surprised that you left it till now before making it clear. You\u0027ve caught me in a net so that I\u0027m tangled like a gladiator and I can\u0027t fight my way out.\u0027\\n\\n Still the angel said nothing.\\n\\n Christ went on, \u0027And why me? Why must it be my hand that betrays him? It\u0027s not as if he\u0027s hard to find. It\u0027s not as if no one in Jerusalem knows what he looks like. It\u0027s not as if there are no greedy scum who wouldn\u0027t give him away for a handful of coins. Why must I do it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you remember what Abraham said when he was commanded to sacrifice his son?\u0027 said the angel then.\\n\\n Christ was silent.\\n\\n \u0027He said nothing,\u0027 he said finally.\\n\\n \u0027And do you remember what happened when he lifted the knife?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027An angel told him not to harm the boy. And then he saw the ram caught in the thicket.\u0027\\n\\n The angel stood up to leave.\\n\\n \u0027Take your time, my dear Christ,\u0027 he said. \u0027Consider everything. When you\u0027re ready, come to the house of Caiaphas, the high priest.\u0027\\n\\n Christ at the Pool of Bethesda\\n\\n Christ meant to stay in his room and think about the ram in the thicket: did the angel mean that something would happen at the last minute to save his brother? What else could he have meant?\\n\\n But the room was small and stuffy, and Christ needed fresh air. He wrapped his cloak around himself and went out into the streets. He walked towards the temple, and then away again; he walked towards the Damascus gate, and then turned to one side, whether left or right he didn\u0027t know; and presently he found himself at the pool of Bethesda. This was a place where invalids of every kind came in the hope of being healed. The pool was surrounded by a colonnade under which some of the sick slept all night, though they were supposed to come only during the hours of daylight.\\n\\n Christ made his way quietly under the colonnade and sat on the steps that led down to the pool. The moon was nearly full, but clouds covered the sky, and Christ could not see much apart from the pale stone and the dark water. He hadn\u0027t been there for more than a minute when he heard a shuffling sound, and turned in alarm to see something coming towards him: a man whose legs were paralysed pulling himself laboriously over the stone pavement.\\n\\n Christ got up, ready to move away, but the man said, \u0027Wait, sir, wait for me.\u0027\\n\\n Christ sat down again. He wanted to be alone, but he remembered the angel\u0027s description of the good work that would be done by that church they both wanted to see; could he possibly turn away from this poor man? Or could the beggar in some unimaginable way be the ram that would be sacrificed instead of Jesus?\\n\\n \u0027How can I help you?\u0027 Christ said quietly.\\n\\n \u0027Just stay and talk to me for a minute or two, sir. That\u0027s all I want.\u0027\\n\\n The crippled man pulled himself up next to Christ and lay there breathing heavily.\\n\\n \u0027How long have you been waiting for a cure?\u0027 said Christ.\\n\\n \u0027Twelve years, sir.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Will no one help you to the water? Shall I help you now?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No good now, sir. What happens is that an angel comes every so often and stirs the water up, and the first one in the pool afterwards gets cured. I can\u0027t move so quickly, as you may have noticed.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How do you live? What do you eat? Have you got friends or a family to look after you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s some people who come along sometimes and give us a bit of food.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-good-man-jesus-and-the-scoundrel-christ-canongate-myth-16/page-11.html","bookId":2094,"book":{"id":2094,"title":"The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ (Canongate Myth #16)","description":"Storyline: The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ (Canongate Myths #16) \\n The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ is a novel by Philip Pullman.
