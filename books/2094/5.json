{"id":90322,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Jesus Preaches on the Mountain\\n\\n One day Jesus went out to find a great crowd of people who had come from far away: as well as those from Galilee, people had come from the lands of the Decapolis beyond the Jordan, from Jerusalem and Judea. In order to make it easier for them all to hear his teaching, Jesus climbed up into the mountains a little way, with his disciples and the crowd following. Christ was inconspicuous among them, and no one knew who he was, for they were all strangers to the district. He had a tablet and a stylus with him to take notes about what Jesus said.\\n\\n When Jesus had reached a prominent spot, he began to speak.\\n\\n \u0027What am I preaching?\u0027 he said. \u0027The Kingdom of God, that\u0027s what. It\u0027s coming, friends, it\u0027s on its way. And today I\u0027m going to tell you who\u0027s going to be received into the Kingdom, and who isn\u0027t, so pay attention. It\u0027s the difference between being blessed and being cursed. Don\u0027t ignore what I say to you, now. A great deal hangs on this.\\n\\n \u0027So here you are then: the poor will be blessed. Those who have nothing now will soon inherit all the Kingdom of God.\\n\\n \u0027The hungry will be blessed. In the Kingdom, they will be filled with good food; they will never hunger again.\\n\\n \u0027Those who mourn will be blessed; those who weep now will be blessed, because when the Kingdom comes, they will be comforted, and they will laugh with joy.\\n\\n \u0027Those who are scorned and hated will be blessed. Those who are persecuted, and lied about, and defamed, and slandered, and exiled ¨C they will be blessed. Remember the prophets, think of how badly they were treated in their time, and be glad if people treat you the same way; because when the Kingdom comes, you will be rejoicing, believe me.\\n\\n \u0027The merciful, the kindly, the meek ¨C they will be blessed. They will inherit the earth.\\n\\n \u0027Those who are pure in heart and think no evil of others ¨C they will be blessed.\\n\\n \u0027Those who make peace between enemies, those who solve bitter disputes ¨C they will be blessed. They are the children of God.\\n\\n \u0027But beware, and remember what I tell you: there are some who will be cursed, who will never inherit the Kingdom of God. D\u0027you want to know who they are? Here goes:\\n\\n \u0027Those who are rich will be cursed. They\u0027ve had all the consolation they\u0027re going to get.\\n\\n \u0027Those whose bellies are full now will be cursed. They will suffer the pangs of hunger everlastingly.\\n\\n \u0027Those who look at poverty and hunger without concern, and turn away with a laugh on their lips, will be cursed; they will have plenty to mourn about; they will weep for ever.\\n\\n \u0027Those who are well-spoken of, and praised by the powerful, and flattered and fawned over by loud voices in public places, will be cursed. They will have no place in the Kingdom.\u0027\\n\\n The people cheered at these words, and crowded close to hear more of what Jesus was saying.\\n\\n Christ is Saved by the Stranger\\n\\n But at the edge of the crowd someone had noticed what Christ was doing as he noted down the words of Jesus, and said, \u0027A spy! Here\u0027s a spy from the Romans ¨C throw him off the mountain!\u0027\\n\\n Before Christ could defend himself, another voice spoke beside him:\\n\\n \u0027No, friend, you\u0027re wrong. This man is one of us. He\u0027s writing down the words of the teacher so he can take them and tell others the good news.\u0027\\n\\n Christ\u0027s accuser was convinced, and turned back to listen to Jesus, forgetting Christ in a moment. Christ saw that the man who had defended him was none other than the stranger, the priest whose name he had not managed to learn.\\n\\n \u0027Come aside with me for a moment,\u0027 said the stranger.\\n\\n They withdrew from the crowd, and sat under the shade of a tamarisk.\\n\\n \u0027Am I doing the right thing?\u0027 said Christ. \u0027I wanted to be sure I heard him correctly, in case there was any judgement later.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It is an excellent thing to do,\u0027 said the stranger. \u0027Sometimes there is a danger that people might misinterpret the words of a popular speaker. The statements need to be edited, the meanings clarified, the complexities unravelled for the simple-of-understanding. In fact, I want you to continue. Keep a record of what your brother says, and I shall collect your reports from time to time, so that we can begin the work of interpretation.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027These words that Jesus is saying,\u0027 said Christ, \u0027they might be seditious, I think. The man thought I was a Roman spy... It wouldn\u0027t be surprising if the Romans did take an interest, would it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very shrewdly observed,\u0027 said the stranger. \u0027That\u0027s exactly what we have to bear in mind. Political matters are delicate and dangerous, and it requires a subtle mind and a strong nerve to negotiate them safely. I\u0027m sure we can rely on you.\u0027\\n\\n And with a friendly squeeze of Christ\u0027s shoulder, the stranger got to his feet and moved away. There were a dozen questions that Christ wanted to ask him, but before he could utter a word, the stranger was lost in the crowd. From the way he had spoken about political affairs, Christ wondered if his first guess had been right: perhaps the stranger was not just a priest, but a member of the Sanhedrin. That was the council that settled all doctrinal and judicial matters among the Jews, as well as dealing with Jewish relations with the Romans, and its members, of course, were men of great wisdom.\\n\\n Jesus Continues his Sermon on the Mountain\\n\\n Christ took his tablet and stylus and moved to a place where he could hear what his brother was saying. It seemed that someone had asked Jesus to tell them about the law, and whether what it said was still valid in the time of the Kingdom of God.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t anyone think I\u0027m telling you to abandon the law and the prophets,\u0027 Jesus said. \u0027I haven\u0027t come here to abolish them. I\u0027m here to fulfil them. I\u0027m telling you truly: not one word, not one letter of the law will be superseded until heaven and earth pass away. If you break one of these laws, even the least of them, beware.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But there are degrees, aren\u0027t there, master?\u0027 someone called out. \u0027A little sin isn\u0027t as bad as a big sin, surely?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know there\u0027s a commandment against murder. Where would you draw the line? Would you say murder is wrong, but beating someone is maybe a little less wrong, and just being angry with them isn\u0027t wrong at all? I\u0027m telling you that if you\u0027re angry with a brother or a sister, by which I mean anyone at all, even if you\u0027ve just got a grudge against them, don\u0027t dare to go and offer a gift in the temple until you\u0027ve made your peace with them. Do that first of all.\\n\\n \u0027And I won\u0027t have any talk about little sins and big sins. That won\u0027t wash in the Kingdom of God. The same goes for adultery. You know the commandment against adultery: it says don\u0027t do it. It doesn\u0027t say \"You must not commit adultery, but it\u0027s all right to think about it.\" It isn\u0027t. Every time you look at a woman with lustful thoughts, you\u0027re already committing adultery with her in your heart. Don\u0027t do it. And if your eyes keep looking that way, pluck them out. You think adultery is bad, but divorce is all right? You\u0027re wrong: if you divorce your wife for any reason other than her unchastity, you cause her to commit adultery when she marries again. And if you marry a divorced woman, you commit adultery. Marriage is a serious business. So is hell. And that\u0027s where you\u0027ll go if you think that as long as you avoid the big sins, you can get away with the little ones.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You said we mustn\u0027t be violent, master, but if someone attacks you, surely you can fight back?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027\"An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth\"? Is that what you\u0027re thinking about? Don\u0027t do it. If anyone hits you on the right cheek, offer him the left as well. If anyone wants to take your coat away, give him your cloak to go with it. If he forces you to go one mile, go two. You know why that is? Because you should love your enemy, that\u0027s why. Yes, you heard me right: love your enemies, and pray for them. Think of God your Father in heaven, and do as he does. He makes the sun rise on the wicked as well as on the good; he sends the rain to fall on the righteous as well as the unrighteous. What\u0027s the good of loving only those who love you? Why, even a tax-collector does that. And if you care only for your brothers and sisters, you\u0027re doing no more than the Gentiles. Be perfect.\u0027\\n\\n Christ wrote this all down diligently, taking care to inscribe \u0027These are the words that Jesus spoke\u0027 on each tablet, so no one should think they were his own opinions.\\n\\n Someone was asking about almsgiving.\\n\\n \u0027Good question,\u0027 said Jesus. \u0027What you should do when you give alms is to shut up about it. Keep silent. You know the sort of people who make a great spectacle of their generosity: don\u0027t do as they do. Let no one know when you give, or how much you give, or what cause you give it to. Don\u0027t even let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. Your Father in heaven will see, don\u0027t worry about that.\\n\\n \u0027And while I\u0027m talking about keeping quiet, here\u0027s another thing to be secret about: and that\u0027s prayer. Don\u0027t be like those ostentatious hypocrites who pray out loud and let the whole neighbourhood know about their piety. Go to your room, shut the door, pray in silence and in secret. Your Father will hear. And have you ever heard the Gentiles pray? On and on, yakkety yak, blah blah blah, as if the very sound of their voices were music in the ears of God. Don\u0027t be like them. There\u0027s no need to tell God what you\u0027re asking for; he knows already.\\n\\n \u0027This is how you should pray. You should say:\\n\\n \u0027Father in heaven, your name is holy.\\n\\n \u0027Your Kingdom is coming, and your will shall be done on earth as it\u0027s done in heaven.\\n\\n \u0027Give us today the bread we need.\\n\\n \u0027And forgive our debts, as we shall forgive those who are indebted to us.\\n\\n \u0027And don\u0027t let the evil one tempt us more than we can resist.\\n\\n \u0027Because the Kingdom and the power and the glory belong to you for ever.\\n\\n \u0027So be it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Master,\u0027 someone called out, \u0027if the Kingdom is coming, as you say, how should we live? Should we carry on our trades, should we build houses and raise families and pay taxes as we\u0027ve always done, or has everything changed now we know about the Kingdom?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re right, friend, everything has changed. There\u0027s no need to worry about what you\u0027re going to eat or drink, where you\u0027re going to sleep, what you\u0027re going to wear. Look at the birds: do they sow or reap? Do they gather wheat into the barn? They don\u0027t do any of those things, and yet their Father in heaven feeds them every day. Don\u0027t you think you\u0027re more valuable than the birds? And think what worrying does: has anyone ever added a single hour to the length of his life by worrying about it?\\n\\n \u0027And think about clothing. Look at the lilies in the field, how beautiful they are. Not even Solomon in all his splendour looked as glorious as a wild flower. And if God clothes the grass of the field like that, don\u0027t you think he\u0027ll take even more care of you? You with little faith! I\u0027ve told you before: don\u0027t behave like the Gentiles. They\u0027re the ones who fret about things like that. So stop worrying about tomorrow; tomorrow will take care of itself. Today has enough trouble of its own.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What should we do when we see someone else doing wrong?\u0027 called out one man. \u0027Should we try and put them straight?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who are you to judge anyone else?\u0027 said Jesus. \u0027You point out the speck in your neighbour\u0027s eye, and you don\u0027t notice the plank in your own. Take the plank out of your eye first, and then you can see to take the speck out of your neighbour\u0027s.\\n\\n \u0027And you need to see clearly when you look at what you\u0027re doing. You need to think and get things right. You don\u0027t give meat from sacrifices to the dogs ¨C you might as well give a pearl necklace to a pig. Think what that means.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Master, how do we know that all will be well?\u0027 said one man.\\n\\n \u0027You just ask, and it\u0027ll be given to you. You just search, and you\u0027ll find. You just knock, and the door will be opened. You don\u0027t believe me? Consider this: is there a man or woman alive who, when their child asks for bread, gives them a stone? Of course not. And if you, sinners every one of you, know how to give nourishment to a child, think how much better your Father in heaven will know how to give good things to those who ask for them.\\n\\n \u0027Now I\u0027m going to stop talking soon, but there are a few more things you need to hear and remember. There are true prophets, and there are false prophets, and this is how to tell the difference: look at the fruits they bear. Do you gather grapes from a thorn bush? Do you look for figs among the thistles? Of course not, because a bad tree can\u0027t bear good fruit, and a good tree doesn\u0027t bear bad fruit. You will know true prophets and false prophets by the fruits they bear. And a tree that bears bad fruit is cut down in the end, and thrown on the fire.\\n\\n \u0027And remember this: take the hard road, not the easy one. The road that leads to life is a hard one, and it passes through a narrow gate, but the road to destruction is easy, and the gate is broad. Plenty take the easy road; few take the hard one. Your job is to find the hard one, and go by that.\\n\\n \u0027If you hear these words of mine, and act on them, you\u0027ll be like a wise man who builds his house on a rock. The rain falls, the floods come, the winds howl and beat on the house, but it doesn\u0027t fall, because it\u0027s been founded on a rock. But if you hear my words and don\u0027t act on them, you\u0027ll be like a foolish man who builds his house on sand. And what happens when the rain falls and the floods come and the winds beat against it? The house falls down ¨C and it falls with a great smash.\\n\\n \u0027And this is the final thing I\u0027ll say to you: do to others as you hope they would do to you.\\n\\n \u0027This is the law and the prophets, this is everything you need to know.\u0027\\n\\n Christ watched as the crowd moved away, and listened to what they said.\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s not like the scribes,\u0027 said one.\\n\\n \u0027He talks as if he knows things.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I never heard straight talking like that before!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s not the sort of waffle you get from the usual preachers. This man knows what he\u0027s talking about.\u0027\\n\\n And Christ considered everything he\u0027d heard that day, and pondered it deeply as he transcribed the words from his tablet on to a scroll; but he said nothing to anyone.\\n\\n The Death of John\\n\\n All this time John the Baptist had been captive in prison. King Herod Antipas really wanted to put him to death, but he knew that John was popular with the people, and he feared what they might do in response. Now the king\u0027s wife ¨C the one John had criticised him for marrying ¨C was called Herodias, and she had a daughter called Salome. When the court was celebrating the king\u0027s birthday Salome danced for him, and pleased everyone so much that Herod promised to give her whatever she asked for. Her mother prompted her, and she said, \u0027I want the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\u0027\\n\\n Herod was privately dismayed. But he had promised in front of his guests, and he couldn\u0027t back down; so he ordered the executioner to go to the prison and behead John at once. It was done, and the head was brought, just as Salome had demanded, on a platter. The girl gave it to Herodias. As for the Baptist\u0027s body, his followers came to the prison and took it away to be buried. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-good-man-jesus-and-the-scoundrel-christ-canongate-myth-16/page-5.html","bookId":2094,"book":{"id":2094,"title":"The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ (Canongate Myth #16)","description":"Storyline: The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ (Canongate Myths #16) \\n The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ is a novel by Philip Pullman.
