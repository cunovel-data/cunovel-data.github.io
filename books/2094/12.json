Maybe they\u0027re just good.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t be stupid,\u0027 said another voice in the darkness. \u0027No one\u0027s good. It\u0027s not natural to be good. They do it so\u0027s other people will think more highly of them. They wouldn\u0027t do it otherwise.\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t know nothing,\u0027 said a third voice from under the colonnade. \u0027People can earn high opinions in quicker ways than doing good. They do it because they\u0027re frightened.\u0027 \u0027Frightened of what?\u0027 said the second voice. \u0027Frightened of hell, you blind fool. They think they can buy their way out of it by doing good.\u0027 \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter why they do it,\u0027 said the lame man, \u0027as long as they do it. Anyway, some people are just good.\u0027 \u0027Some people are just soft, like you, you worm,\u0027 said the third voice. \u0027Why\u0027s no one helped you down to the water in twelve years? Eh? Because you\u0027re filthy, that\u0027s why. You stink, like we all do. They\u0027ll throw a bit of bread your way, but they won\u0027t touch you. That\u0027s how good they are. You know what real charity would be? It wouldn\u0027t be bread. They don\u0027t miss bread. They can buy more bread whenever they want. Real charity would be a pretty young whore coming down here and giving us a good time for nothing. Can you imagine a sweet-faced girl with skin like silk coming and laying herself down in my arms, with my sores oozing pus all over her and stinking like a dungheap? If you can imagine that, you can imagine real goodness. I\u0027m damned if I can. I could live a thousand years and never see goodness like that.\u0027 \u0027Because it wouldn\u0027t be goodness,\u0027 said the blind man. \u0027It\u0027d be wickedness and fornication, and she\u0027d be punished and so would you.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s old Sarah,\u0027 said the lame man. \u0027She come down here last week. She does it for nothing.\u0027 \u0027Because she\u0027s mad and full of drink,\u0027 said the leper. \u0027Mad enough to lie with you, anyway. But even she wouldn\u0027t lie with me.\u0027 \u0027Even a dead whore wouldn\u0027t lie with you, you filthy leper,\u0027 said the blind man. \u0027She\u0027d get out of her grave and crawl away in her bones sooner than that.\u0027 \u0027You tell me what goodness is, then,\u0027 said the leper. \u0027You want to know what goodness is? I\u0027ll tell you what goodness is. Goodness would be to take a sharp knife and go round the city by night and cut the throats of all the rich men, and their wives and their children, and their servants too, and every living thing in their houses. That\u0027d be an act of supreme goodness.\u0027 \u0027You can\u0027t say that\u0027d be good,\u0027 said the lame man. \u0027That\u0027d be murder, rich men or not. That\u0027s forbidden. You know it is.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re ignorant. You don\u0027t know the scriptures. When King Sennacherib was besieging Jerusalem the angel of the Lord came down in the night and slew one hundred and eighty-five thousand of his soldiers while they was all asleep. That was a good deed. It\u0027s righteous and holy to slay the oppressor ¨C always has been. You tell me if we poor people aren\u0027t oppressed by the rich. If I was a rich man I\u0027d have servants to fetch and carry for me, I\u0027d have a wife to lie with me, I\u0027d have children to honour my name, I\u0027d have harpists and singers to make sweet music for me, I\u0027d have stewards to look after my money and manage my fields and livestock, I\u0027d have every convenient thing to make life easy for a blind man. The high priest would call on me, I\u0027d be praised in the synagogues, I\u0027d be respected all through Judea, blind or not.\u0027 \u0027And would you give charity to a poor cripple by the pool of Bethesda?\u0027 said the lame man. \u0027No, I wouldn\u0027t. Not a penny. And why not? Because I\u0027d still be blind, and I wouldn\u0027t be able to see you, and if anyone tried to tell me about you, I wouldn\u0027t listen. Because I\u0027d be rich. You wouldn\u0027t matter to me.\u0027 \u0027Well, you\u0027d deserve to have your throat cut, then,\u0027 said the leper. \u0027That\u0027s what I\u0027m saying, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 Christ said, \u0027There\u0027s a man called Jesus. A holy man, a healer. If he came here-\u0027 \u0027Waste of time,\u0027 said the leper. \u0027There\u0027s a dozen or more beggars who come here every day, pretending to be cripples, hiring themselves out to the holy men. A couple of drachmas and they\u0027ll swear they\u0027ve been crippled or blind for years and then stage a bloody miraculous recovery. Holy men? Healers? Don\u0027t make me laugh.\u0027 \u0027But this man is different,\u0027 said Christ. \u0027I remember him,\u0027 said the blind man. \u0027Jesus. He come here on the sabbath, like a fool. The priests wouldn\u0027t let him heal anyone on the sabbath. He should\u0027ve known that.\u0027 \u0027But he did heal someone,\u0027 said the lame man. \u0027Old Hiram. You remember that. He told him to take up his bed and walk.\u0027 \u0027Bloody rubbish,\u0027 said the blind man. \u0027Hiram went as far as the temple gate, then he lay down and went on begging. Old Sarah told me. He said what was the use of taking his living away? Begging was the only thing he knew how to do. You and your blether about goodness,\u0027 he said, turning to Christ, \u0027where\u0027s the goodness in throwing an old man out into the street without a trade, without a home, without a penny? Eh? That Jesus is asking too much of people.\u0027 \u0027But he was good,\u0027 said the lame man. \u0027I don\u0027t care what you say. You could feel it, you could see it in his eyes.\u0027 \u0027I never saw it,\u0027 said the blind man. Christ said to the lame man, \u0027And what do you think goodness is?\u0027 \u0027Just a little human companionship, sir. A poor man has got little to enjoy in this life, and a cripple even less. The touch of a kindly hand is worth gold to me, sir. If you was to embrace me, sir, just put your arms around me for a moment and kiss me, I\u0027d treasure that, sir. That would be real goodness.\u0027 The man stank. The smell of faeces, urine, vomit, and years of accumulated filth rose from him in a cloud. Christ leant down and tried to embrace him, and had to turn away, and retched, and tried again. There was a moment of clumsiness as the lame man\u0027s arms tried to embrace him in return, and then the smell became too much, and Christ had to kiss him very quickly and then push him away and stand up. A short laugh came from the darkness under the colonnade. Christ hurried outside and away, breathing the cold air deeply, and only when he had passed the great tower at the corner of the temple complex did he discover that during their clumsy embrace the lame man had stolen the purse that hung from his girdle. He sat down trembling in a corner of the wall and wept for himself, for the money he\u0027d lost, for the three men by the pool of Bethesda, for his brother Jesus, for the prostitute with the cancer, for all the poor people in the world, for his mother and father, for his own childhood, when it had been so easy to be good. Things could not go on like this. When he had recovered he went to meet the angel at the house of Caiaphas, but he could not stop trembling. Caiaphas When Christ arrived he found the angel waiting in the courtyard, and the two of them were shown into the high priest\u0027s presence at once. They found him rising from prayer. He had dismissed all his advisers, saying that he needed to ponder their words; but he greeted the angel as if he were a valued counsellor. \u0027This is the man,\u0027 said the angel, indicating Christ. \u0027It is very good of you to come. May I offer you some refreshment?\u0027 said Caiaphas. But Christ and the angel refused. \u0027Better so, perhaps,\u0027 said Caiaphas. \u0027This is an unhappy business. I do not want to know your name. Your friend will have told you what we require. The guards who will arrest Jesus have been drafted in from elsewhere, and don\u0027t know what he looks like, so we need someone who can point him out. You are willing to do this?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Christ. \u0027But why have you had to draft in extra guards?\u0027 \u0027There is considerable disagreement ¨C I am being very frank ¨C not only in our council, but among the people in general, and the guards are not immune to this. Those who have seen and heard Jesus are excited, volatile, unstable; some love him and some deplore him. I have to send a squad I can rely on not to argue among themselves. This is a very delicate situation.\u0027 \u0027Have you yourself seen and heard him?\u0027 said Christ. \u0027Unfortunately I haven\u0027t had the opportunity. Naturally, I\u0027ve heard full reports of his words and deeds. If times were easier I would greatly enjoy meeting him and discussing matters of common interest. But I have to maintain a very difficult balance. My overriding concern is to keep the body of the faithful together. There are factions that would like to split away entirely and join with the Zealots; there are others that would like nothing better than for me to rally all the Jews in open defiance of the Romans; there are others that urge me to maintain good relations with the governor, on the grounds that our greatest duty is to preserve the peace and the lives of our people. I have to satisfy as many of these demands as I can, while not alienating those who have to be disappointed, and above all, as I say, keeping some kind of unity. It\u0027s hard to get the balance right. But the Lord has placed this burden on my shoulders, and I must bear it as best I can.\u0027 \u0027What will the Romans do to Jesus?\u0027 \u0027I... \u0027 Caiaphas spread his hands wide. \u0027They will do what they will do. It wouldn\u0027t be long before they picked him up themselves in any case. And that\u0027s another of our problems; if the religious authorities don\u0027t take steps to deal with this man, it will seem as if we\u0027re supporting him, and that will put all the Jews in danger. I must look after my people. The governor, alas, is a brutal man. If I could save this man Jesus, if I could perform a miracle and transport him in a moment to Babylon or to Athens, I would do it at once. But we are constrained by circumstances. There is nothing else I can do.\u0027 Christ bowed his head. He could see that Caiaphas was a good and honest man, and that his position was impossible. The high priest turned away and picked up a little bag of money. \u0027Now you must let me pay you for your trouble,\u0027 he said. And Christ remembered that his purse had been stolen, and that he owed money for the rent of his room. At the same time, he felt ashamed to take this money from Caiaphas. He knew that the angel saw he was hesitating, and he turned to explain. \u0027My purse was-\u0027 But the angel held up a hand in understanding. \u0027No need to explain,\u0027 he said. \u0027Take the money. It\u0027s offered in perfect honesty.\u0027 So Christ took it, and felt sick again. Caiaphas said goodbye to the two of them, and summoned the captain of the guard. Jesus in the Garden at Gethsemane Now all that evening Jesus had been sitting with his disciples and talking with them, but at midnight he said, \u0027I\u0027m going out. Peter, James, John, come with me; the rest of you can stay and sleep.\u0027 They left the others and walked towards the nearest gate in the city wall. Peter said, \u0027Master, be careful tonight. There\u0027s a rumour that they\u0027re reinforcing the temple guards. And the governor\u0027s looking for an excuse to crack down ¨C everyone\u0027s talking about it.\u0027 \u0027Why would they do that?\u0027 \u0027Things like this,\u0027 said John, pointing to the mud-daubed words KING JESUS on the nearest wall. \u0027Did you write that there?\u0027 said Jesus. \u0027Of course not.\u0027 \u0027Well, it doesn\u0027t concern you, then. Ignore it.\u0027 John knew that it concerned them all, but he said nothing. He stayed to brush the words off and then hurried after the others. Jesus went across the valley to a garden on the slopes of the Mount of Olives. \u0027Wait here,\u0027 he said. \u0027Keep watch. Let me know if anyone comes.\u0027 They sat down under an olive tree and wrapped their cloaks around them, because the night was cold. Jesus went apart a little way and knelt down. \u0027You\u0027re not listening,\u0027 he whispered. \u0027I\u0027ve been speaking to you all my life and all I\u0027ve heard back is silence. Where are you? Are you out there among the stars? Is that it? Busy making another world, perhaps, because you\u0027re sick of this one? You\u0027ve gone away, haven\u0027t you, you\u0027ve abandoned us. \u0027You\u0027re making a liar out of me, you realise that. I don\u0027t want to tell lies. I try to tell the truth. But I tell them you\u0027re a loving father watching over them all, and you\u0027re not; you\u0027re blind as well as deaf, as far as I can tell. You can\u0027t see, or you just don\u0027t want to look?

Published at Easter 2010 by Canongate Books, it tells the story of Jesus as if he were two people, \"Jesus\" and \"Christ,\" with contrasting personalities; Jesus being a moral and godly man, and his brother Christ a calculating figure who wishes to use Jesus\u0027 legacy to found a powerful Church. The book has attracted controversy, as well as hate mail sent to Pullman by Christian fundamentalists threatening him with damnation. Pullman\u0027s historical understanding has been criticised by Professor Gerald O\u0027Collins.
