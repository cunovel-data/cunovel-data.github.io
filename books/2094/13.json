{"id":90330,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\u0027No answer. Not interested.\n \u0027If you were listening, you\u0027d know what I meant by truth. I\u0027m not one of these logic-choppers, these fastidious philosophers, with their scented Greek rubbish about a pure world of spiritual forms where everything is perfect, and which is the only place where the real truth is, unlike this filthy material world which is corrupt and gross and full of untruth and imperfection... Have you heard them? Stupid question. You\u0027re not interested in slander either.\n \u0027And slander\u0027s what it is; you made this world, and it\u0027s lovely, every inch of it. When I think of the things I\u0027ve loved I find myself choking with happiness, or maybe sorrow, I don\u0027t know; and every one of them has been something in this world that you made. If anyone can smell frying fish on an evening by the lake, or feel a cool breeze on a hot day, or see a little animal trying to run around and tumbling over and getting up again, or kiss a pair of soft and willing lips, if anyone can feel those things and still maintain they\u0027re nothing but crude imperfect copies of something much better in another world, they are slandering you, Lord, as surely as words mean anything at all. But then they don\u0027t think words do mean anything; they\u0027re just tokens to play sophisticated games with. Truth is this, and truth is that, and what is truth anyway, and on and on they go, these bloodless phantoms.\n \u0027The psalm says, \"The fool has said in his heart, There is no God.\" Well, I understand that fool. You treated him as you\u0027re treating me, didn\u0027t you? If that makes me a fool, I\u0027m one with all the fools you made. I love that fool, even if you don\u0027t. The poor sod whispered to you night after night, and heard nothing in response. Even Job, for all the trouble he had, got an answer from you. But the fool and I might as well be talking into an empty pot, except that even an empty pot makes a sound like the wind, if you hold it over your ear. That\u0027s an answer of sorts.\n \u0027Is that what you\u0027re saying to me? That when I hear the wind, I hear your voice? When I look at the stars I see your writing, or in the bark of a tree, or the ripples on the sand at the edge of the water? Lovely things, yes, all of them, no doubt about that, but why did you make them so hard to read? Who can translate them for us? You conceal yourself in enigmas and riddles. Can I believe that the Lord God would behave like one of those philosophers and say things in order to baffle and confuse? No, I can\u0027t believe it. Why do you treat your people like this? The God who made water to be clear and sweet and fresh wouldn\u0027t fill it with mud before giving it to his children to drink. So, what\u0027s the answer? These things are full of your words, and we just have to persevere till we can read them? Or they\u0027re blank and meaningless? Which is it?\n \u0027No answer, naturally. Listen to that silence. Not a breath of wind; the little insects scratching away in the grasses; Peter snoring over there under the olives; a dog barking on some farm out behind me in the hills; an owl down in the valley; and the infinite silence under it all. You\u0027re not in the sounds, are you. There might be some help in that. I love those little insects. That\u0027s a good dog out there; he\u0027s trustworthy; he\u0027d die to look after the farm. The owl is beautiful and cares for her young. Even Peter\u0027s full of kindness, for all the noise and the bluster. If I thought you were in those sounds, I could love you with all my heart, even if those were the only sounds you made. But you\u0027re in the silence. You say nothing.\n \u0027God, is there any difference between saying that and saying you\u0027re not there at all? I can imagine some philosophical smartarse of a priest in years to come pulling the wool over his poor followers\u0027 eyes: \"God\u0027s great absence is, of course, the very sign of his presence\", or some such drivel. The people will hear his words, and think how clever he is to say such things, and they\u0027ll try and believe it; and they\u0027ll go home puzzled and hungry, because it makes no sense at all. That priest is worse than the fool in the psalm, who at least is an honest man. When the fool prays to you and gets no answer, he decides that God\u0027s great absence means he\u0027s not bloody well there.\n \u0027What am I going to tell the people tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that? Am I going to go on telling them things I can\u0027t believe? My heart will grow weary of it; my belly will churn with sickness; my mouth will be full of ash and my throat will burn with gall. There\u0027ll come a day when I\u0027ll say to some poor leper that his sins are forgiven and his sores will heal and he\u0027ll say, \"But they\u0027re as bad as they ever were. Where is this healing you promised?\"\n \u0027And the Kingdom...\n \u0027Have I been deluding myself as well as everyone else? What have I been doing, telling them that it\u0027s going to come, that there are people alive now who will see the coming of God\u0027s Kingdom? I can see us waiting, and waiting, and waiting... Was my brother right when he talked of this great organisation, this church of his that was going to serve as the vehicle for the Kingdom on earth? No, he was wrong, he was wrong. My whole heart and mind and body revolted against that. They still do.\n \u0027Because I can see just what would happen if that kind of thing came about. The devil would rub his hands with glee. As soon as men who believe they\u0027re doing God\u0027s will get hold of power, whether it\u0027s in a household or a village or in Jerusalem or in Rome itself, the devil enters into them. It isn\u0027t long before they start drawing up lists of punishments for all kinds of innocent activities, sentencing people to be flogged or stoned in the name of God for wearing this or eating that or believing the other. And the privileged ones will build great palaces and temples to strut around in, and levy taxes on the poor to pay for their luxuries; and they\u0027ll start keeping the very scriptures secret, saying there are some truths too holy to be revealed to the ordinary people, so that only the priests\u0027 interpretation will be allowed, and they\u0027ll torture and kill anyone who wants to make the word of God clear and plain to all; and with every day that passes they\u0027ll become more and more fearful, because the more power they have the less they\u0027ll trust anyone, so they\u0027ll have spies and betrayals and denunciations and secret tribunals, and put the poor harmless heretics they flush out to horrible public deaths, to terrify the rest into obedience.\n \u0027And from time to time, to distract the people from their miseries and fire them with anger against someone else, the governors of this church will declare that such-and-such a nation or such-and-such a people is evil and ought to be destroyed, and they\u0027ll gather great armies and set off to kill and burn and loot and rape and plunder, and they\u0027ll raise their standard over the smoking ruins of what was once a fair and prosperous land and declare that God\u0027s Kingdom is so much the larger and more magnificent as a result.\n \u0027But any priest who wants to indulge his secret appetites, his greed, his lust, his cruelty, will find himself like a wolf in a field of lambs where the shepherd is bound and gagged and blinded. No one will even think of questioning the rightness of what this holy man does in private; and his little victims will cry to heaven for pity, and their tears will wet his hands, and he\u0027ll wipe them on his robe and press them together piously and cast his eyes upwards and the people will say what a fine thing it is to have such a holy man as priest, how well he takes care of the children...\n \u0027And where will you be? Will you look down and strike these blaspheming serpents with a thunderbolt? Will you strike the governors off their thrones and smash their palaces to rubble?\n \u0027To ask the question and wait for the answer is to know that there will be no answer.\n \u0027Lord, if I thought you were listening, I\u0027d pray for this above all: that any church set up in your name should remain poor, and powerless, and modest. That it should wield no authority except that of love. That it should never cast anyone out. That it should own no property and make no laws. That it should not condemn, but only forgive. That it should be not like a palace with marble walls and polished floors, and guards standing at the door, but like a tree with its roots deep in the soil, that shelters every kind of bird and beast and gives blossom in the spring and shade in the hot sun and fruit in the season, and in time gives up its good sound wood for the carpenter; but that sheds many thousands of seeds so that new trees can grow in its place. Does the tree say to the sparrow, \"Get out, you don\u0027t belong here?\" Does the tree say to the hungry man, \"This fruit is not for you?\" Does the tree test the loyalty of the beasts before it allows them into the shade?\n \u0027This is all I can do now, whisper into the silence. How much longer will I even feel like doing that? You\u0027re not there. You\u0027ve never heard me. I\u0027d do better to talk to a tree, to talk to a dog, an owl, a little grasshopper. They\u0027ll always be there. I\u0027m with the fool in the psalm. You thought we could get on without you; no Â¨C you didn\u0027t care whether we got on without you or not. You just got up and left. So that\u0027s what we\u0027re doing, we\u0027re getting on. I\u0027m part of the world, and I love every grain of sand and blade of grass and drop of blood in it. There might as well not be anything else, because these things are enough to gladden the heart and calm the spirit; and we know they delight the body. Body and spirit... is there a difference? Where does one end and the other begin? Aren\u0027t they the same thing?\n \u0027From time to time we\u0027ll remember you, like a grandfather who was loved once, but who has died, and we\u0027ll tell stories about you; and we\u0027ll feed the lambs and reap the corn and press the wine, and sit under the tree in the cool of the evening, and welcome the stranger and look after the children, and nurse the sick and comfort the dying, and then lie down when our time comes, without a pang, without a fear, and go back to the earth.\n \u0027And let the silence talk to itself... \u0027\n Jesus stopped. There was nothing else he wanted to say.\n The Arrest of Jesus\n But a little distance away John was sitting up and rubbing his eyes, and then he kicked Peter awake and pointed down into the valley; and then got to his feet and hurried up to where Jesus was still kneeling by himself.\n \u0027Master,\u0027 he said, \u0027I\u0027m sorry, forgive me, I don\u0027t want to disturb you, but there are men with torches coming up the path from the city.\u0027\n Jesus took John\u0027s hand and stood up.\n \u0027You could get away, master,\u0027 John said. \u0027Peter\u0027s got a sword. We can hold them off Â¨C tell them we haven\u0027t seen you.\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Jesus. \u0027I don\u0027t want any fighting.\u0027\n And he walked down the path towards the other disciples, and told Peter to put his sword away.\n As they came up the path in the torchlight Christ said to the captain of the guards, \u0027I\u0027ll embrace him, and you\u0027ll know who it is.\u0027\n When they came close to Jesus and the other three, Christ went up to his brother and kissed him.\n \u0027You?\u0027 said Jesus.\n Christ wanted to speak, but he was shoved aside as the guards moved past him. He was soon lost among the crowd of curious onlookers who had heard rumours of what was going to happen, and come along to watch.\n Seeing Jesus under arrest, the people thought that he\u0027d betrayed their trust in him; that he was just another religious deceiver, like so many others, and that everything he\u0027d told them had been false. They began to shout and jeer, and they might even have attacked and lynched him there and then, if the guards had not held them off; Peter tried to draw his sword again, but Jesus saw him and shook his head.\n Peter said, \u0027Master! We\u0027re with you! We won\u0027t leave you! Wherever they take you, I\u0027ll come too!\u0027\n The guards marched Jesus off down the path, and Peter hastened after them. They took him through the city gate and along to the house of the high priest. Peter had to wait in the courtyard outside, where he joined the servants and the guards around the brazier they\u0027d lit to keep themselves warm, for it was a cold night.\n Jesus before the Council\n Inside the house, Caiaphas had called together an emergency council of the chief priests and the elders and the scribes. This was unusual, because Jewish law normally prohibited courts from sitting at night, but the circumstances were urgent; if they were going to deal with Jesus the priests would have to do it before the festival began.\n Jesus was brought before this council, and they began to question him. Some of the priests who had lost to him in argument were eager for a reason to hand him over to the Romans, and they had summoned witnesses in the hope of convicting him. However, they hadn\u0027t coached the witnesses well enough, and several of them contradicted one another; for example, one said, \u0027I heard him say he could destroy the temple, and build another in three days.\u0027\n \u0027No! That wasn\u0027t him!\u0027 said another. \u0027That was one of his followers.\u0027\n \u0027But Jesus didn\u0027t deny it!\u0027\n \u0027It was him. I heard him say it myself.\u0027\n Not all the priests were sure that was reason enough to condemn him.\n Finally Caiaphas said, \u0027Well, Jesus, what have you got to say? What\u0027s your answer to these charges?\u0027\n Jesus said nothing.\n \u0027And what about this other charge of blasphemy? That you claim to be the son of God? The Messiah?\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s what you say,\u0027 said Jesus.\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s what your followers say,\u0027 said Caiaphas. \u0027Don\u0027t you bear any responsibility for that?\u0027\n \u0027I have asked them not to. But even if I had said that, it would not be blasphemy, as you well know.\u0027\n Jesus was right, and Caiaphas and the priests knew it. Strictly speaking, blasphemy consisted of cursing the name of God, and Jesus had never done that. \u0027 Then what about this claim to be king of the Jews? We see it everywhere daubed on the walls. What have you to say to that?\u0027\n Jesus said nothing.\n \u0027Silence is no answer,\u0027 said Caiaphas.\n Jesus smiled.\n \u0027Jesus, we\u0027re trying very hard to be fair to you,\u0027 the high priest went on. \u0027It seems to us that you\u0027ve gone out of your way to provoke trouble, not only with us, but with the Romans. And these are difficult times. We have to protect our people. Can\u0027t you see that? Don\u0027t you understand the danger you\u0027re putting everyone in?\u0027\n Jesus still said nothing.\n Caiaphas turned to the priests and scribes, saying, \u0027I\u0027m sorry to say that we have very little choice. We shall have to take this man to the governor in the morning. Of course, we shall pray that he is merciful.\u0027\n Peter\n While this was happening inside the high priest\u0027s house, the courtyard was crowded with people clustering around the brazier for warmth, and talking with anxious excitement about the arrest of Jesus, and what was likely to happen next. Peter was there among them, and at one point a servant girl looked at him and said, \u0027You were with that Jesus, weren\u0027t you? I saw you with him yesterday.\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Peter. \u0027He\u0027s nothing to do with me.\u0027\n A little later someone else said to his companions, \u0027This man was one of Jesus\u0027s followers. He was in the temple with him when he upset the money-changers\u0027 tables.\u0027\n \u0027Not me,\u0027 said Peter. \u0027You must be mistaken.\u0027\n And just before dawn a third person, hearing Peter make some remark, said, \u0027You\u0027re one of them, aren\u0027t you? I can tell by your accent. You\u0027re a Galilean, like him.\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\u0027 said Peter.\n Just then a cock crew. Until that moment the world had seemed to be holding its breath, as if time itself were suspended during the hours of darkness; but soon the daylight would come, and with it the full desolation would break in. Peter felt that, and he went outside and wept bitterly.\n Jesus and Pilate\n After Christ had betrayed his brother to the soldiers, he went by himself to pray. He hoped that the angel would come back to him, because he felt he had to talk about what he\u0027d done and what might happen next; and he badly wanted to explain about the money.\n He prayed, but he couldn\u0027t sleep, so at first light he went to the high priest\u0027s house, where he heard about the Galilean who had denied being one of Jesus\u0027s followers, and who had wept at the cock-crow. Even in the middle of his tension and distress, Christ made a note of that.\n But he was restless and agitated still, and joined the crowd that had gathered to see what the verdict on Jesus would be.\n Presently a rumour began to spread: they were taking Jesus to the Roman governor. And soon afterwards the doors of the high priest\u0027s house opened, and a troop of temple guards came out, bringing Jesus with them, his hands bound behind him. The guards had to protect him from the people, who only a few days ago had welcomed him with cheers and shouts of joy; now they were yelling at him, shaking their fists, and spitting.\n Christ followed as they made their way to the governor\u0027s palace. The governor at the time was Pontius Pilate, a brutal man much given to handing out cruel punishments. There was another prisoner awaiting sentence, a political terrorist and murderer called Barabbas, and it was almost certain that he was going to be crucified.\n Christ remembered the ram caught in the thicket.\n When the guards reached the governor\u0027s palace, they dragged Jesus inside and flung him down at Pilate\u0027s feet. Caiaphas had come to press the charges against Jesus, and Pilate listened while he spoke.\n \u0027You will have seen, sir, the daubings on the walls Â¨C \"King Jesus\". This is the man responsible. He has caused chaos in the temple, he has excited the mob, and we are conscious of the danger of civil disorder, so-\u0027\n \u0027You hear that?\u0027 said Pilate to Jesus. \u0027I\u0027ve seen those filthy daubings. So that was you, was it? You claim to be the king of the Jews?\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-good-man-jesus-and-the-scoundrel-christ-canongate-myth-16/page-13.html","bookId":2094,"book":{"id":2094,"title":"The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ (Canongate Myth #16)","description":"Storyline: \n The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ (Canongate Myths #16) \n The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ is a novel by Philip Pullman.
