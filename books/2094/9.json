I must believe it, and you must believe it.\u0027 \u0027Tell me again.\u0027 \u0027Your sins are forgiven. Truly.\u0027 \u0027How will I know?\u0027 \u0027You must have faith.\u0027 \u0027If I have faith, will I be healed?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027I will have faith, if you do, sir.\u0027 \u0027I do.\u0027 \u0027Tell me once more.\u0027 \u0027I have said it... Very well: your sins are forgiven.\u0027 \u0027And yet I\u0027m not healed,\u0027 she said. She closed her robe. Christ said, \u0027And I am not my brother. Didn\u0027t I tell you that? Why did you ask me to heal you, if you knew I was not Jesus? Did I ever claim to be able to heal you? I said to you \"Your sins are forgiven.\" If you don\u0027t have sufficient faith after you\u0027ve heard that, the fault is yours.\u0027 The woman turned away and faced the wall, and drew her robe over her head. Christ left her house. He was ashamed, and he went out of the town and climbed to a quiet place among the rocks, and prayed that his own sins might be forgiven. He wept a little. He was afraid the angel might come to him, and he hid all night. The Wise and Foolish Girls Now the time of the Passover was getting close, and this prompted the people who listened to Jesus to ask about the Kingdom again: when will it come? How will we know it? What should we do to be ready for it? \u0027It\u0027ll be like this,\u0027 he told them. \u0027There was a wedding, and ten girls took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom and welcome him to the banquet. Now five of them took their lamps and nothing else, no spare oil, but the other five were a bit cleverer than that, and they brought some flasks of oil with them. \u0027Well, the bridegroom was delayed, and time went past, and all of the girls began to feel drowsy and closed their eyes. \u0027Then at midnight there was a cry: \"He\u0027s coming! The bridegroom is here!\" \u0027The girls woke up at once and started trimming their lamps. You can see what happened next: the foolish ones discovered that their oil had run out. \u0027\"Give us some of your oil!\" they said to the others. \"Look, our lamps are going out!\" \u0027And two of the far-seeing ones shared their oil with two of the foolish ones, and all four were admitted to the banquet. Two of the clever ones refused, and the bridegroom shut them out, together with two more foolish ones. \u0027But the last wise girl said, \"Lord, we have come to celebrate your wedding, even the least of us. If you won\u0027t let us all in, I would rather stay outside with my sisters, even when the last of my oil is gone.\" \u0027And for her sake the bridegroom opened the doors of the banquet and admitted them all. Now, where was the Kingdom of heaven? Inside the bridegroom\u0027s house? Is that what you think? No, it was outside in the dark with the wise girl and her sisters, even when the last of her oil was gone.\u0027 Christ wrote down every word, but he resolved to improve the story later. The Stranger Talks of Abraham and Issac Next time the angel came, Christ was in Jericho. He was following Jesus and his disciples as they made their way to Jerusalem for the Passover. Jesus was staying in the house of one of his followers, but Christ had taken a room in a tavern not far away. At midnight he went outside to use the privy. When he turned to go back inside he felt a hand on his shoulder, and knew at once that it was the stranger. \u0027Events are moving quickly now,\u0027 the stranger said. \u0027We must talk about something important. Take me to your room.\u0027 Once inside, Christ lit the lamp and gathered up the scrolls he had filled. \u0027Sir, what do you do with these scrolls?\u0027 he said. \u0027I take them to a place of great safety.\u0027 \u0027Will I be able to see them again? I may need to edit and correct the entries, in the light of what I have since learned about truth and history.\u0027 \u0027There will be an opportunity for that, never fear. Now tell me about your brother. What is his mood as he gets closer to Jerusalem?\u0027 \u0027He seems serene and confident, sir. I wouldn\u0027t say that has changed at all.\u0027 \u0027Does he speak of what he expects to happen there?\u0027 \u0027Only that the Kingdom will come very soon. Perhaps it will come when he is in the temple.\u0027 \u0027And the disciples? How is your informant? Is he still close to Jesus?\u0027 \u0027I would say he is in the very best position. He is not the closest or the most favoured ¨C Peter and James and John are the men Jesus speaks to most confidentially ¨C but my informant is securely among the middle-ranking followers. His reports are full and trustworthy. I have checked them.\u0027 \u0027We must think about rewarding him at some stage. But now I want to talk to you about something difficult.\u0027 \u0027I am ready, sir.\u0027 \u0027You and I know that for the Kingdom to flourish, it needs a body of men, and women too, both Jews and Gentiles, faithful followers under the guidance of men of authority and wisdom. And this church ¨C we can call it a church ¨C will need men of formidable organisational powers and deep intellectual penetration, both to conceive and develop the structure of the body and to formulate the doctrines that will hold it together. There are such men, and they are ready and waiting. The church will not lack organisation and doctrine. \u0027But you will remember, my dear Christ, the story of Abraham and Isaac. God sets his people severe tests. How many men of today would be ready to act like Abraham, prepared to sacrifice his son because the Lord had told him to? How many would be like Isaac, ready to do as his father told him and hold out his hands to be bound, and lie down on the altar, and wait peaceably for the knife in the serene confidence of righteousness?\u0027 \u0027I would,\u0027 said Christ at once. \u0027If that is what God wants, I would do that. If it would serve the Kingdom, yes, I would. If it would serve my brother, yes, yes, I would.\u0027 He spoke eagerly, because he knew that this would give him the chance to atone for his failure to heal the woman with the cancer. It was his faith that had been insufficient, not hers; he had spoken harshly to her, and he still felt ashamed. \u0027You are devoted to your brother,\u0027 said the stranger. \u0027Yes. Everything I do is for him, though he doesn\u0027t know it. I have been shaping the history especially to magnify his name.\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t forget what I told you when we first spoke: your name will shine as greatly as his.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think of that.\u0027 \u0027No, but it may give you comfort to think that others do, and are working to make sure it comes about.\u0027 \u0027Others? There are others besides you, sir?\u0027 \u0027A legion. And it will come to happen, have no fear about that. But before I go, let me ask you again: do you understand how it might be necessary for one man to die so that many can live?\u0027 \u0027No, I don\u0027t understand it, but I accept it. If it is God\u0027s will, I accept it, even if it\u0027s impossible to understand. The story doesn\u0027t say whether Abraham and Isaac understood what they had to do, but they didn\u0027t hesitate to do it.\u0027 \u0027Remember your words,\u0027 said the angel. \u0027We shall talk again in Jerusalem.\u0027 He kissed Christ on the brow before leaving with the scrolls. Jesus Rides into Jerusalem Next day, Jesus and his followers prepared to leave for Jerusalem. Word had spread that he was coming, and many people came to see him and welcome him on his way to the city, because his fame was now so widespread. The priests and the scribes, of course, had been aware of him for some time, and they didn\u0027t know how best to react. It was a difficult matter for them: should they endorse him and hope to share his popularity, at the cost of not knowing what he would do next? Or should they condemn him, and risk offending the people who supported him in such numbers? They resolved to watch closely, and to test him whenever they saw the chance. Jesus and his disciples had reached Bethphage, near a place called the Mount of Olives, when he told them to stop and rest. He sent two of the disciples to find a beast for him to ride on, because he was tired. All they could find was the foal of a donkey, and when the owner heard who it was for, he refused any payment. The disciples spread their cloaks on the donkey and Jesus rode it into Jerusalem. The streets were thronged with people curious to see him, or eager to welcome him. Christ was among the crowd, watching everything, and he saw how one or two people had cut palm branches to wave; he was already composing the account of the scene in his mind. Jesus was calm and unaffected by the clamour, and acknowledged all the questions that people called out without answering any of them: \u0027Are you going to preach here, master?\u0027 \u0027Are you going to heal?\u0027 \u0027What are you going to do, Lord?\u0027 \u0027Will you go to the temple?\u0027 \u0027Have you come to speak to the priests?\u0027 \u0027Are you going to fight the Romans?\u0027 \u0027Master, will you heal my son?\u0027 The disciples cleared a way to the house where he was going to stay, and presently the crowd dispersed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-good-man-jesus-and-the-scoundrel-christ-canongate-myth-16/page-9.html","bookId":2094,"book":{"id":2094,"title":"The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ (Canongate Myth #16)","description":"Storyline: The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ (Canongate Myths #16) The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ is a novel by Philip Pullman. Published at Easter 2010 by Canongate Books, it tells the story of Jesus as if he were two people, \"Jesus\" and \"Christ,\" with contrasting personalities; Jesus being a moral and godly man, and his brother Christ a calculating figure who wishes to use Jesus\u0027 legacy to found a powerful Church. The book has attracted controversy, as well as hate mail sent to Pullman by Christian fundamentalists threatening him with damnation. Pullman\u0027s historical understanding has been criticised by Professor Gerald O\u0027Collins.
