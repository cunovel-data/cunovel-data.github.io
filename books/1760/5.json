{"id":72067,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\"What\u0027s that? I can\u0027t hear what you\u0027re saying!\"\n Beenay realized that he hadn\u0027t managed to get out anything more than a croak. \"It\u0027s Beenay, I said! I-I want to change our appointment time.\"\n \"To change it? Look, fellow, I understand how you feel about mornings, because so do I. But I\u0027ve absolutely got to talk to you no later than noon tomorrow or I\u0027ll have no story here. I\u0027ll make it up to you any way I can, but-\"\n \"You don\u0027t understand. I want to see you sooner, not later, Theremon.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"This evening. Let\u0027s say half past nine. Or ten, if you can\u0027t make it.\"\n \"I thought you had photographs to take at the Observatory.\"\n \"The deuce with the photos, man. I need to see you.\"\n \"Need to? Beenay, what\u0027s happened? Is it something with Raissta?\"\n \"It has nothing to do with Raissta in the slightest. Half past nine? At the Six Suns?\"\n \"Six Suns, half past nine, yes,\" Theremon said. \"It\u0027s a date.\" Beenay broke the contact and sat for a long moment staring at the rolled paper cylinder before him, somberly shaking his head. He felt fractionally calmer now, but only fractionally. Confiding in Theremon would make it easier to bear the burden of all this. He trusted Theremon completely. Newsmen were generally not noted for their trustworthiness, Beenay knew, but Theremon was a friend first, a journalist after that. He had never betrayed Beenay\u0027s confidence, not once.\n Even so, Beenay didn\u0027t have any idea of his next move. Maybe Theremon would be able to come up with something. Maybe.\n He left the Observatory by the back stairs, sneaking out by the fire escape like a thief. He didn\u0027t dare risk the possibility of running into Athor by going out the main way. It was appalling to him to consider the possibility of seeing Athor now, having to confront him face to face, man to man.\n He found the motor scooter ride home a terrifying one. At every moment he was afraid that the laws of gravity would cease to hold true, that he would go soaring off into the heavens. But at last Beenay reached the little apartment that he shared with Raissta 717.\n She gasped when she saw him.\n \"Beenay! You\u0027re white as a-\"\n \"Ghost, yes.\" He reached for her and pulled her close against him. \"Hold me,\" he said. \"Hold me.\"\n \"What is it? What happened?\"\n \"I\u0027ll tell you later,\" he said. \"Just hold me.\"\n Theremon was at the Six Suns Club a little after nine. It was probably a good idea to get a head start on Beenay, a quick drink or two first, just to lubricate his brain a little. The astronomer had sounded awful-as though he was keeping hysteria at bay only by some tremendous effort. Theremon couldn\u0027t imagine what terrible thing could have happened to him, there in the seclusion and stillness of the Observatory, to make such a wreck out of him in so short a time. But plainly Beenay was in big trouble, and plainly he was going to need the highest-quality help Theremon could provide.\n \"Let me have a Tano Special,\" Theremon told the waiter. \"No, wait-make it a double. A Tano Sitha, okay?\"\n \"Double white light,\" the waiter said. \"Coming up.\"\n The evening was mild. Theremon, who was well known here and received special treatment, had been given his regular warm-weather table on the terrace overlooking the city. The lights of downtown sparkled gaily. Onos had set an hour or two ago, and only Trey and Patru were in the sky, burning brightly in the east, casting harsh twin shadows as they made their descent toward morning.\n Looking at them, Theremon wondered which suns would be in the sky tomorrow. It was different all the time, a brilliant ever changing display. Onos, certainly-you could always be sure of seeing Onos at least part of the time every day of the year, even he knew that-and then what? Dovim, Tano, and Sitha, to make it a four-sun day? He wasn\u0027t sure. Maybe it was supposed to be just Tano and Sitha, with Onos visible only for a few hours at midday. That would be gloomy. But then, after a second sip, he reminded himself that this wasn\u0027t the season for short Onos-rises. So it would be a three-sun day, most likely, unless it was going to be just Onos and Dovim tomorrow.\n It was so hard to keep it all straight- Well, he could ask to see an almanac, if he really cared. But he didn\u0027t. Some people always seemed to know what tomorrow\u0027s suns would be like-Beenay was one, naturally-but Theremon took a more happy-go-lucky approach to it all. So long as some sun was going to be up there the next day, Theremon didn\u0027t especially care which one it was. And there always was one-two or three, actually, or sometimes four. You could count on that. Even five, once in a while.\n His drink arrived. He took a deep gulp and exhaled in pleasure. What a delightful thing a Tano Special was! The good strong white rum of the Velkareen Islands, mixed with a shot of the even stronger product, clear and tangy, that they distilled on the coast of Bagilar, and just a dab of sgarrino juice to take the edge off-ah, magnificent! Theremon wasn\u0027t a particularly heavy drinker, certainly not the way newspapermen were legendarily supposed to be, but he counted it a shabby day when he couldn\u0027t find time for one or two Tano Specials in those quiet dusky hours after Onos had set.\n \"You look like you\u0027re enjoying that, Theremon,\" a familiar voice said behind him.\n \"Beenay! You\u0027re early!\"\n \"Ten minutes. What are you drinking?\"\n \"The usual. A Tano Special.\"\n \"Good. I think I\u0027ll have one too.\"\n \"You?\" Theremon stared at his friend. Fruit juice was about Beenay\u0027s speed, so far as he knew. He couldn\u0027t recall ever having seen the astronomer drink anything stronger.\n But Beenay looked strange this evening-haggard, weary, worn. His eyes had an almost feverish glow to them.\n \"Waiter!\" Theremon called.\n It was alarming to see Beenay gulp his drink. He gasped after the first slug, as though the impact was a lot greater than he\u0027d been expecting, but then he went back to it quickly for a second deep pull, and a third.\n \"Easy,\" Theremon urged. \"Your head\u0027ll be swimming in five minutes.\"\n \"It\u0027s swimming already.\"\n \"You had a drink before you came here?\" -\n \"No, not a drink,\" Beenay said. \"A shock. An upset.\" He put his drink down and peered balefully at the city lights. After a moment he picked it up again, almost absent-mindedly, and drained what was left. -\"I shouldn\u0027t have another one so soon, should I, Theremon?\"\n \"I doubt it very much.\" Theremon reached out and let his hand rest lightly on the astronomer\u0027s wrist. \"What\u0027s going on, fellow? Tell me about it.\"\n \"It\u0027s-hard to explain.\"\n \"Come on. I\u0027ve been around the track a little, you know. You and Raissta-\"\n \"No! I told you before, this has nothing to do with her. Nothing.\"\n \"All right. I believe you.\"\n Beenay said, \"Maybe I should have that second drink.\"\n \"In a little while. Come on, Beenay. What is it?\"\n Beenay sighed. \"You know what the Theory of Universal Gravitation is, don\u0027t you, Theremon?\"\n \"Of course I do. I mean, I couldn\u0027t tell you what it means, exactly-there are only twelve people on Kalgash who truly understand it, isn\u0027t that so?-but I can certainly tell you what it is-more or less.\"\n \"So you believe that garbage too,\" Beenay said, with a harsh laugh. \"About the Theory of Gravitation being so complicated that only twelve people can understand its math.\"\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve always heard.\"\n \"What you\u0027ve always heard is ignorant folk wisdom,\" said Beenay. \"I could give you all the essential math in a sentence, and you\u0027d probably understand what I was saying, too.\"\n \"You could? I would?\"\n \"No question of it. Look, Theremon: the Law of Universal Gravitation-the Theory of Universal Gravitation, I mean- states that there exists a cohesive force among all bodies of the universe, such that the amount of this force between any two given bodies is proportional to the product of their masses divided by the square of the distance between them. It\u0027s that simple.\"\n \"That\u0027s all there is to it?\"\n \"That\u0027s enough! It took four hundred years to develop it.\"\n \"Why that long? It seems simple enough, the way you put it.\"\n \"Because great laws aren\u0027t divined by flashes of inspiration, no matter what you newspaper people like to believe. It usually takes the combined work of a worldful of scientists over a period of centuries. Ever since Genovi 41 discovered that Kalgash rotates around Onos, rather than vice versa-and that was about four centuries ago-astronomers have been working on the problem of why all six of the suns appear and disappear in the sky as they do. The complex motions of the six were recorded and analyzed and unwoven. Theory after theory was advanced and checked and counterchecked and modified and abandoned and revived and converted to something else. It was a deuce of a job.\"\n Theremon nodded thoughtfully and finished off his drink. He signaled the waiter for two more. Beenay seemed calm enough so long as he was talking about science, he thought.\n \"It was some thirty years ago,\" the astronomer continued, \"that Athor 77 put the touch of perfection on the whole thing by demonstrating that the Theory of Universal Gravitation accounts exactly for the orbital motions of the six suns. It was an amazing achievement. It was one of the greatest feats of sheer logic anyone has ever accomplished.\"\n \"I know how you revere that man,\" Theremon said. \"But what does all this have to do with-\"\n \"I\u0027m getting to the point.\" Beenay rose and walked to the edge of the terrace, carrying his second drink with him. He stood there in silence for a time, looking out at distant Trey and Patru. It seemed to Theremon that Beenay was growing agitated again. But the newspaperman said nothing. After a time Beenay took a long gulp of his drink. Standing with his back still turned, he said finally, \"The problem is this. A few months ago I began working on a recalculation of the motions of Kalgash around Onos, using the big new university computer. I provided the computer with the last six weeks\u0027 actual observations of Kalgash\u0027s orbit and told it to predict the orbital movements for the rest of the year. I didn\u0027t expect any surprises. Mainly I just wanted an excuse to fool around with the computer, I guess. Naturally, I used the gravitational laws in setting up my calculations.\" He swung around suddenly. His face had a bleak, haunted look. \"Theremon, it didn\u0027t come out right.\"\n \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\n \"The orbit the computer produced didn\u0027t match up with the hypothetical orbit I was expecting to get. I don\u0027t mean that I was simply working on the basis of a pure Kalgash-Onos system, you realize. I took into account all perturbations that the other suns would cause. And what I got-what the computer was claiming to be the true orbit of Kalgash-was something very different from the orbit that is indicated by Athor\u0027s Theory of Gravitation.\"\n \"But you said you used Athor\u0027s gravitational laws in setting things up,\" said Theremon, puzzled.\n \"I did.\"\n \"Then how-\" Suddenly Theremon\u0027s eyes brightened. \"Good lord, man! What a story! Are you telling me that the brand-new supercomputer at Saro University, installed at a cost of I don\u0027t want to think how many millions of credits, is inaccurate? That there\u0027s been a gigantic scandalous waste of the taxpayers\u0027 money? That-\"\n \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with the computer, Theremon. Believe me.\"\n \"Can you be sure of that?\"\n \"Positive.\"\n \"Then-what-\" -\n \"I might have given the computer erroneous figures, maybe. It\u0027s a terrific computer, but it can\u0027t get the right answer from the wrong data.\" -\n \"So that\u0027s why you\u0027re so upset, Beenay! Listen, man, it\u0027s only human to make an error once in a while. You mustn\u0027t be so harsh on yourself. You-\"\n \"I needed to be completely certain that I had fed the right numbers into the computer, first of all, and also that I had given it the right theoretical postulates to use in processing those numbers,\" said Beenay, clutching his glass so tightly that his hand shook. The glass was empty now, Theremon noticed. \"As you say, it\u0027s only human to make an error once in a while. So I called in a couple of hotshot young graduate students and let them work on the problem. They had their results for me today. That was the meeting I had that was so important, when I said I couldn\u0027t see you. Theremon, they confirmed my findings. They got the same deviation in the orbit that I did.\"\n \"But if the computer was right, then-then-\" Theremon shook his head. \"Then what? The Theory of Universal Gravitation is wrong? Is that what you\u0027re saying?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n The word appeared to have come from Beenay at a terrible price. He seemed stunned, dazed, devastated.\n Theremon studied him. No doubt this was confusing for Beenay, and probably very embarrassing. But the journalist still couldn\u0027t understand why the impact of all this on him was so powerful.\n Then abruptly he understood everything.\n \"It\u0027s Athor! You\u0027re afraid of hurting Athor, aren\u0027t you?\"\n \"That\u0027s it exactly,\" said Beenay, giving Theremon a look of almost pathetic gratitude for having seen the true situation. He threw himself down in his chair, shoulders hunched, head lowered. In a muffled voice he said, \"It would kill the old man to know that someone\u0027s poked a hole in his wonderful theory. That I, of all people, had poked a hole in it. He\u0027s been like a second father to me, Theremon. Everything I\u0027ve accomplished in the past ten years has been done under his guidance, with his encouragement, with-with, well, his love, in a manner of speaking. And now I repay it like this. I wouldn\u0027t just be destroying his life\u0027s work-I\u0027d be stabbing him, Theremon, him.\"\n \"Have you considered simply suppressing your findings?\"\n Beenay looked astonished. \"You know I couldn\u0027t do that!\"\n \"Yes. Yes, I do know. But I had to find out whether you were thinking of it.\"\n \"Whether I was thinking of the unthinkable? No, of course not. It never entered my mind. But what am I going to do, Theremon? -I suppose I could just throw all the papers away and pretend I never looked into the whole subject. But that would be monstrous. So what it comes down to is, I have a choice between violating my own scientific conscience and ruining Athor. Ruining the man I look upon not simply as the head of my profession but as my own philosophical mentor.\"\n \"He can\u0027t have been much of a mentor, then.\"\n The astronomer\u0027s eyes widened in astonishment and fury. \"What are you saying, Theremon!\" -\n \"Easy. Easy.\" Theremon spread his hands wide in a conciliatory gesture. \"It seems to me you\u0027re being awfully condescending to him, Beenay. If Athor\u0027s really the great man you think he is, he\u0027s not going to put his own reputation above scientific truth. Do you see what I mean? Athor\u0027s theory is not cast-iron. No theory is and there is always room for improvement. Isn\u0027t that so? Science is constructed out of approximations that gradually approach the truth, you told me a long time back, and I\u0027ve never forgotten it. Well, that means all theories are subject to constant testing and modification, doesn\u0027t it? And if it eventually turns out that they\u0027re not quite close enough to the truth, they need to be replaced by something that\u0027s closer. Right, Beenay? Right?\"\n Beenay was trembling now. He looked very pale.\n \"Could you get me another drink, Theremon?\"\n \"No. Listen to me: there\u0027s more. You say that you\u0027re so worried about Athor-he\u0027s old; I suppose he\u0027s pretty frail-that you don\u0027t have the heart to tell him you\u0027ve found a flaw in his theory. All right. That\u0027s a decent and loving position to take. But think about this, will you? If calculating the orbit of Kalgash is all that important, somebody else is likely to stumble across the same flaw in Athor\u0027s theory sooner or later, and that other person isn\u0027t likely to be as tactful in letting Athor know about it as you\u0027d be. He might even be a professional rival of Athor\u0027s, an outright enemy of his-every scientist has enemies, you\u0027ve told me so plenty of times. Wouldn\u0027t it be better for you to go to Athor and tell him, gently, carefully, of what you\u0027ve discovered, than for him to find out about it one morning in the Chronicle?\"\n \"Yes,\" Beenay whispered. \"You\u0027re completely right.\"\n \"You\u0027ll go to him, then?\"\n \"Yes. Yes. I have to, I suppose.\" Beenay bit his lip. \"I feel miserable about this, Theremon. I feel like a murderer.\"\n \"I know you do. But it isn\u0027t Athor you\u0027ll be murdering, it\u0027s a defective theory. Defective theories must never be allowed to persist. You owe it to Athor as well as yourself to let the truth emerge.\" Theremon hesitated. A sudden startling new idea had occurred to him. \"Of course, there\u0027s one other possibility. I\u0027m only a layman, you know, and you\u0027ll probably laugh. -Is there any chance that the Theory of Gravitation might be correct despite everything, and that the computer\u0027s figures for Kalgash\u0027s orbit are right also, and that some other factor entirely, something altogether unknown, might be responsible for the discrepancy in your result?\"\n \"That could be, I suppose,\" said Beenay in a flat, dispirited tone. \"But once you begin dragging in mysterious unknown factors, you begin to move into the realm of fantasy. -I\u0027ll give you an example. Let\u0027s say there\u0027s an invisible seventh sun out there-it\u0027s got mass, it exerts gravitational force, but we simply can\u0027t see it. Since we don\u0027t know it\u0027s there, we haven\u0027t plugged it into our gravitational calculations, and so the figures come out cockeyed. Is that what you mean?\"\n \"Well, why not?\"\n \"Why not five invisible suns, then? Why nOt fifty? Why not an invisible giant who pushed planets around according to his whims? Why not a huge dragon whose breath deflects Kalgash from its proper path? We can\u0027t disprove it, can we? When you start in with why nots, Theremon, anything becomes possible, and then nothing makes any sense. At least not to me. I can only deal with what I know is real. You may be right that there\u0027s an unknown factor, and that therefore the gravitational laws aren\u0027t invalid. I certainly hope so. But I can\u0027t do serious work on that basis. All I can do is go to Athor, which I will, I promise you that, and tell him what the computer has told me. I don\u0027t dare suggest to him or anybody that I blame the whole mess on a hitherto undiscovered \u0027unknown factor.\u0027 Otherwise I\u0027d sound just as crazy as the Apostles of Flame, who claim to know all sorts of mystic revelations. -Theremon, I really want that other drink now.\"\n \"Yes. All right. And speaking of the Apostles of Flame-\"\n \"You want a statement from me, I remember.\" Beenay passed a hand wearily in front of his face. \"Yes. Yes. I won\u0027t let you down. You\u0027ve been a tremendous help to me this evening. What is it exactly that the Apostles have said now? I forget.\"\n \"It was Mondior 71,\" said Theremon. \"The Grand High Mumbo-Jumbo himself. What he said was-let me think-that the time is very near when the gods intend to purge the world of sin, that he can calculate the exact day, even the exact hour, when doom will arrive.\"\n Beenay groaned. \"So what\u0027s new about that? Isn\u0027t that what they\u0027ve been saying for years?\"\n \"Yes, but they\u0027re starting to hand out more of the gory details now. It\u0027s the notion of the Apostles, you know, that this won\u0027t be the first time the world has been destroyed. They teach that the gods have deliberately made mankind imperfect, as a test, and that they have given us a single year-one of their divine years, not one of our little ones-in which to shape up. That\u0027s called a Year of Godliness, and it\u0027s exactly two thousand and forty-nine of our years long. Again and again, when the Year of Godliness has ended, the gods have discovered that we\u0027re still wicked and sinful, and so they have destroyed the world by sending down heavenly flames from holy places in the sky that are known as Stars. So say the Apostles, anyway.\"\n \"Stars?\" Beenay said. \"Does he mean the suns?\"\n \"No, Stars. Mondior says that the Stars are specifically different from the six suns. -Haven\u0027t you ever paid any attention to this stuff, Beenay?\"\n \"No. Why in the world should I?\"\n \"Well, in any event, when the Year of Godliness ends and nothing on Kalgash has improved, morally speaking, these Stars drop some sort of holy fire on us and burn us up. Mondior says this has happened any number of times. But each time it does, the gods are merciful, or at least a faction among them is: every time the world is destroyed, the kinder gods prevail over the sterner ones and humanity is given one more chance. And so the godliest of the survivors are rescued from the holocaust and a new deadline is set: mankind gets another two thousand and forty-nine years to cast off its evil ways. The time is almost up again, says Mondior. It\u0027s just under two thousand and forty-eight years since the last cataclysm. In something like fourteen months the suns will all disappear and these hideous Stars of his will shoot flame down out of a black sky to wipe out the wicked. Next year on Theptar nineteenth, to be specific.\"\n \"Fourteen months,\" Beenay said in a musing way. \"The nineteenth of Theptar. He\u0027s very precise about it, isn\u0027t he? I suppose he knows the exact time of day it\u0027ll happen, too.\"\n \"So he says, yes. That\u0027s why I\u0027d like a statement from somebody connected with the Observatory, preferably you. Mondior\u0027s latest announcement is that the exact time of the catastrophe can be calculated scientifically-that it isn\u0027t simply something that\u0027s set forth as dogma in the Book of Revelations, but that it\u0027s subject to the same sort of computation that astronomers employ when-when-\"\n Theremon faltered and halted.\n \"When we calculate the orbital motions of the suns and the world?\" Beenay asked acidly.\n \"Well, yes,\" Theremon said, looking abashed.\n \"Then maybe there\u0027s hope for the world after all, if the Apostles can\u0027t do any better job of it than we do.\"\n \"I need a statement, Beenay.\"\n \"Yes. I realize that.\" The next round of drinks had arrived. Beenay wrapped his hand around his glass. \"Try this,\" he said after a moment. \"\u0027The main task of science is to separate truth from untruth, in the hope of revealing the way the universe really works. Putting truth to work in the service of untruth is not what we at the university think of as the scientific way. We are capable now of predicting the movements of the suns in the heavens, yes-but even if we use our best computer, we are no closer than we ever were to being able to foretell the will of the gods. Nor will we ever be, I suspect.\u0027 -How\u0027s that?\"\n \"Perfect,\" Theremon said. \"Let\u0027s see if I\u0027ve got it. \u0027The main task of science is to separate truth from untruth, in the hope of-of-\u0027 What came next, Beenay?\"\n Beenay repeated the whole thing word for word, as though he had memorized it hours before.\n Then he drained his third drink at a single astonishing long gulp.\n And then he stood up, smiled for the first time all evening, and fell flat on his face. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/nightfall/page-5.html","bookId":1760,"book":{"id":1760,"title":"Nightfall","description":"Storyline: \n Nightfall \n by Isaac Asimov, Robert Silverberg \n Imagine living on a planet with six suns that never experiences Darkness.
