{"id":95355,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\"Repurposed.\" Southern Command doesn\u0027t call it a retreat, or abandonment, or evacuation. Word has come down from on high: What\u0027s left of Javelin is being \"repurposed.\" General Martinez calls it a part of his \"new approach\" to the war against the Kurians. Admittedly, General Martinez was, is, and continues to be a controversial figure. What the precise proportion of malfeasance, malpractice, and misjudgment went into his tenure as the Southern Command chief general is the object of some dispute. There are still those who maintain that Martinez\u0027s only fault was to see to the welfare of the men under his command first and foremost, only fighting when it was absolutely necessary. But a wise man knows that in life, absolutes vanish like a desert mirage, receding into an unknown distance before it can be quantified. At Fort Seng, the men don\u0027t reveal much of their thoughts. They carefully pack souvenirs picked up on the march-both the conventional, like some of Karas\u0027 old Kentucky coin or one of the short, curved ceremonial knives of the Moondaggers, and the odd: buttons, bits of coal slag, commerce stamps with elaborate imagery, Kurian newspapers with their jumbled and misleading accounts of the fighting, bar coasters from the rail towns outside Lexington, even bits of legworm leather with dates of battles stitched into them. One musically inclined soldier has an entire portfolio full of sheet music. He was struck by how many of the same popular tunes were sung in Kentucky, with altered lyrics or harmonies to give the ditties a local tone. \"Gone-a-homer,\" an Arkansas tune reworded in Kentucky, was adopted by the troops and reworded again to capture the bittersweet nature of defeat-a defeat that meant you\u0027d live to go home to spouses and sweethearts. Beat, whupped, kicked out: These words weren\u0027t spoken aloud but found their way into the song. They were making vests and long johns out of the polyester felt Valentine had brought. It was good-quality material, warm even when wet and so light you hardly knew you were wearing it. They had some doubts about durability, so they were adding coverings and liners made out of old uniforms or Evansville tenting. The workshop was churning out bush jackets and fatigue pants in \"Evansville timber\"-a mottled camouflage that was a light bleach wash of the dark uniforms the Evansville militia wore. Then they dabbed it with two colors of camouflage in a vaguely leopard-spot pattern. Of course there were variations that came from a small group of people working long hours at a fast pace. Sometimes it streaked and ran into tiger stripes; other times the pattern was so tight and tiny it resembled a sort of houndstooth. The end result might not have impressed a discerning Old World eye, civilian or military, but Valentine was oddly proud. Once again, the uniform was one of Ediyak\u0027s designs. A big overcoat with drawstrings at waist and sleeves hung to midthigh. Beneath it was a padded riding vest of the insulating felt and canvas with plenty of utility pockets, and beneath that their uniform shirts. Trousers had reinforced knees and seats and a removable felt liner, but it turned out the buttons meant to secure the liner weren\u0027t comfortable, so they were removed and replaced by hook-and-eye loops. Boots were still a problem. Most of his recruits had come over in civilian duty shoes, fine for the streets of Evansville but no match for the tough field exercises in wet fall weather that Patel put them through. Hobbled men were no use to anyone. Bad feet made men even more miserable than bad teeth. Southern Command had little in the way of spares after the retreat across Kentucky, so Valentine had to settle for tire rubber \"retreads\" cobbled together with rawhide lacing, scraps of webbing, and heavyweight canvas for breathability. The men called them \"Kentucky galoshes\" and suffered through the inevitable blisters and abrasions, but the footwear protected ankles and kept off trench foot. Valentine spent long hours recruiting from the soon-to-depart brigade. A few NCOs volunteered to stay because they wanted to finish the fight in Kentucky. Many were the best of Javelin, and Bloom crossed a few names off Valentine\u0027s list, as she doubted she\u0027d be able to make it back to the Mississippi without them. Others accepted the extravagant promises Valentine made. One or two old soldiers elected to stick because they understood the devil in Kentucky and only God knew where they might be sent when they were \"repurposed.\" Might as well spend the remaining time until land allotment or pension, riding herd on ex-Quislings. Of course, beggars can\u0027t be choosers, nor can they expend much mental effort determining the motivations for those willing to help. Valentine was content to take names, get them approved by Bloom and Lambert, and then work out his battalion\u0027s order of battle-without having any of his volunteers \"demoted,\" so to speak. He did this by creating an on-paper staff company. One benefit of the rumors in Evansville about the departure of much of Southern Command\u0027s forces was a near panic about what might happen if the Kurians returned, especially with rumors about forces massing in Illinois, or Bloomington, or outside of Louisville for a dash down the old interstate. So he had volunteers looking to join Fort Seng in any capacity-on the condition that their families would be able to come along if Fort Seng were abandoned. With food running short, Valentine couldn\u0027t accept all the volunteers, and even with enough to feed them he wouldn\u0027t be able to arm them, but he was able to fill out his uneven companies by taking, for once, the cream of the overflowing pail. Bloom and Lambert both agreed that Southern Command needed some kind of send-off. The only point of contention was whether the piece that remained still be known as Javelin, or if the designation belonged to the brigade proper. Bloom finally relented, mostly because Lambert had organized the whole party to begin with. If Fort Seng became a monument to the Cause\u0027s attempt to create a new Freehold east of the Mississippi and south of the Mason-Dixon, the tombstone might as well bear the proper name. The headquarters staff kept the news of the celebration quiet to avoid raising expectations and just in case word traveled to the Kurian lengths of the river, either toward Paducah or in the direction of Louisville. No telling what the Kurians might choose to create in the way of their own farewell. They detailed a few cooks to roast a pair of pigs and a lamb. Valentine spent the day in the field with his new battalion, returning to see beautiful paper lanterns lining the patio before the great estate house. \"The basement\u0027s full of that sort of crap,\" Bloom told him. \"The guy who used to live here loved to throw a party.\" Valentine\u0027s recruits stayed off to the side as Southern Command\u0027s soldiers occupied tables and chairs and benches. The two groups tolerated each other. Valentine\u0027s men oddly matched each other in the redyed uniforms they\u0027d crossed over to wearing. Southern Command\u0027s troops had their patched fatigues, spruced up with their new medals and odds and ends picked up in Kentucky, mostly raccoon tails and legworm claw feet. A band filled the chilled night air with noise. It was a merry-go-round collection of musicians as the players stopped to eat or drink and rejoined as the mood and tempo suited them. Valentine listened to some soldiers warming themselves around a fire pit with even warmer spiked punch. \"Hope we get repurposed to Oklahoma or Texas-some kind of steer country,\" a corporal said. \"If I never swallow another mouthful of those caterpillars, it\u0027ll be too soon.\" \"You\u0027re forgetting the good lean Kentucky horse meat, Corp. Meals fit for a dog.\" A private leaned back, fingers interlaced behind his head as he reclined. \"Soon as I get home to the wife, my johnson\u0027s being repurposed from peeing, that\u0027s for sure.\" \"Good woman, that. Puts up with that wood tick of a dick for more\u0027n one night.\" \"What do you say, Williams?\" one of the group called to a woman idly tossing cards into her helmet. \"You think the bride said, \u0027I do,\u0027 knowing the triple-A battery Dalrymple here\u0027s sporting?\" \"Size is for sluts. Give me a man with a quick tongue.\" The men laughed, even Dalrymple. She added, \"I meant interesting conversation, you lunk.\" \"Glad we\u0027re getting out of here. Only tongue you\u0027re likely to see otherwise would be out of a Reaper.\" \"Home alive in \u0027seventy-five.\" \"Worn-down dicks in \u0027seventy-six.\" The chatter stopped when they noticed Valentine watching from the shadows. \"I miss the two-for-one whores of \u0027seventy-four, myself,\" Valentine said. Valentine headed for the barbecue spits, purposely altering his course so they wouldn\u0027t have to rise from their coffee and rolls and salute. He found his old company headquarters staff passing a bottle of homemade wine, with vanquished soldiers tucked out of the way beneath their chairs. Valentine wasn\u0027t feeling social. He passed in and out of the conversing groups, shaking hands and wishing well, never lingering to be included in a conversation. He danced once with Bloom, who found his clumsy steps quietly amusing, and once with Lambert, who did her best to hide his offbeat lurches by holding her body so erect and stiff he had to move with her to avoid looking like he was trying to pull down a statue. The Evansville group-\"Valentine\u0027s Legion,\" some were beginning to call them, though Valentine himself corrected anyone who used the phrase-had an uneasy relationship with the Southern Command regulars. The average soldier had a low opinion of Quislings-they either ran from danger or knuckled under it when the Reapers hissed an order-and the soldiers preferred to keep thinking about them in familiar terms: as targets to shoot at or prisoners to be counted. So the ex-Quislings were relegated to the \"back of beyond\" at Fort Seng, a chilly field far from hot water. If the goal of the celebration was to reconcile the two groups, the party was an unmitigated failure. But the two groups each ate well, albeit separately. Brother Mark returned in the darkness. The man had a curious sixth sense about when to show up. If there was plenty of food and drink to be had, he was there. Yet he wasn\u0027t a social man. Like Valentine, he seemed to prefer hanging about the edges. Valentine addressed a long table filled with his old shit-detail company. Many of them were wearing their new stripes and insignia for the first time. \"Be a lot more room for us once the others leave,\" Valentine said. \"More hot water for everyone. We\u0027ll stick new recruits in your tent-shacks.\" \"Be good to have a home at last, sir,\" Glass said. His heavy-weapons Grogs were on guard duty while the men celebrated. It was an unusually optimistic statement from Glass, but odd. He\u0027d grown up in the Free Territory. \"We don\u0027t fit in,\" a corporal said. \"Across the Mississippi, they put us in camps. Had to display ID all the time, wear prisoner clothes. Deep down it ain\u0027t life under the towers, but on the surface it wasn\u0027t that much different.\" Valentine nodded. \"You\u0027re changing that here and now. After you complete your hitch, you\u0027ll be as good as anyone else in the Republics, in the eyes of the law. You can settle wherever you like.\" \"Can we get our land in Kentucky?\" Glass said. \"Better land in some ways than Arkansas. People here aren\u0027t so hung up on where we came from.\" \"Not for me to promise,\" Valentine said. \"There\u0027s Brother Mark. Ask him. He can go to the local government and see what they have to say. But they\u0027ve been plenty helpful to us up until now, haven\u0027t they?\" \"Reward\u0027s always over the next hill,\" Glass said. \"Be nice if we could get something on paper.\" Getting back across the river was much on the soon-to-depart contingent\u0027s mind. Valentine had men step up to say good-bye, shake his hand, or say a few hopeful words about wishing him success in the coming winter. They gave him a present or two as well. One soldier gave him a flexible horsehide case for the new Type Three, having seen him practicing with it on the shooting range. Another gave him one of Karas\u0027 coins, the back carefully polished and re-etched with the brigade\u0027s designation and the dates of the Javelin\u0027s operational activity in beautiful copperplate hand. As everyone settled down into groups after the eating and drinking, to smoke or play cards or show off valuables they were contributing to Bloom\u0027s \"hopper\" to buy supplies for the trip home (and for which they would receive a chit in return that, in theory, would restitute them once they returned to Southern Command, probably in near-worthless military scrip), a guard sergeant with the support staff loosened her belt and exchanged a few words with the musicians. Valentine didn\u0027t know her-she was one of the replacements-but he recognized the song as soon as the soldier with the fiddle began to draw his bow. She sang: The water is wide, I cannot cross o\u0027er But neither have I the wings to fly. Build me a boat, that will carry tow, And both shall row, my love and I. A ship there is, and she sails the sea, She\u0027s laden deep as deep can be, But not so deep as the love I\u0027m in. I know not if I sink or swim. The soprano had a rare voice, sharp glassy tones that carried through the night air. Valentine was reminded of the teenage thug who loved Beethoven in A Clockwork Orange who described a \"so- phisto\" woman\u0027s singing like a rare bird who\u0027d fluttered into the dive. A huddled figure caught Valentine\u0027s eye. Alessa Duvalier was listening from just outside of the splashy colorful light of the paper lanterns, perched on a wall with her legs drawn up and clasped to her chest. Valentine slipped across the party, moving in her direction, while the musicians played the refrain, allowing the singer to catch her breath and more listeners to gather. Even Valentine\u0027s own battalion broke off from eating. I leaned my back on a proud young oak, I thought it was a trusty tree. But first it bended, and then it broke, And so my love proved false to me. He joined her on the limestone wall. Oh, love is fair and love is fine, Bright as a rose, when first it\u0027s new; But love grows old, and sometimes cold, And fades away like the morning dew. \"It\u0027ll never work, you know, Val,\" Duvalier said. \"I thought you were smart about this sort of stuff.\" She had that pungent, slightly cloying smell of liquor about her. \"Which \u0027it,\u0027 my friend?\" Valentine asked. \"If you think I\u0027m making another drunken pass at you, I\u0027m not,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve sworn off men.\" \"Switching to women?\" \"Ugh.\" \"You never could hold your liquor. You want some seltzer? The local stuff\u0027s pretty good. It\u0027ll settle your stomach.\" She pinned him with her foot. \"I haven\u0027t finished with you, Valentine. I figured when you recruited all these Quislings, it was just to have them make corduroy roads or clear brush or what have you. You really want to turn this bunch into a chunk of Southern Command? Quisling scum like that?\" Valentine switched to sign language. They could communicate in sign. They used to do it on their long assignment together as husband and wife on the Gulf Coast when Valentine had been working as a Coastal Marine. He could still use it but had slowed considerably. \"Keep it down; some of the scum can hear you.\" \"I know their kind,\" she said louder than ever. \"They\u0027re whipped, so they\u0027ll cringe and lick your boots for a while. First chance they get-schwwwwwpt!\" She made a throat-cutting gesture with a sauce-smeared finger. \"It\u0027s my throat.\" \"Women fall for crusaders. It\u0027s a chance to be part of something big and good. That day out in Nebraska when you convinced me to go help the Eagles . . . I think I fell a little for you that day. A little. Lots of people get twisted by war, turned into something that\u0027s all sword and no plowshare. I like how you think of them.\" She waved her hand, gesturing vaguely to the northeast. \"But sometimes,\" she said, \"you get all messed up about who the victims and the victimsizer . . . victimizers are. These bastards were stealing and busting heads of anyone who objected a couple months ago. Now you have them in Southern Command uniform. You told me once you spent two years hunting down the rapists of some girl you knew, or of the sister of some girl you knew. How many rapists are you feeding tonight?\" \"None,\" Valentine said. He wondered if he should stick close to Duvalier tonight. Some of the men had heard her. While they wouldn\u0027t loop a noose around her and beat her up, they were perfectly capable of waiting until she passed out and then playing some sort of physical prank that would just make matters worse, especially if Duvalier woke up while someone was inking her face or filling her shoes with manure. \"That\u0027s part of the deal I offered. Whatever their old crimes, they get a new identity the day they sign up.\" \"Like you\u0027re baptizing. Maybe the people who deserve a new life are the ones in Evansville, not these bastards.\" \"Maybe Evansville is happy to have them gone.\" She didn\u0027t respond for a moment, and then she slumped against him. \"Oh, Val, I\u0027m so tired,\" she said, nuzzling his shoulder. \"I\u0027m more tired than I\u0027ve ever been in my life. I want to sleep forever.\" \"Were you across the river again?\" \"Yes. Checking some roads around Evansville in an old pickup. No sign of that armored Spearhead. But I can\u0027t shake the feeling something\u0027s going to happen as soon as Bloom marches her people out of camp.\" \"March out with them,\" Valentine suggested. \"Take a break. You\u0027ve been going hard for as long as I\u0027ve known you.\" \"Can\u0027t. Every time I leave you, you do something stupid and I have to claw you out of it.\" \"I\u0027d do the same for you,\" Valentine said. She yawned. \"You\u0027ll sleep tonight. Where do you bunk these days?\" Duvalier had a habit of sleeping in strange spots: chicken coops, dog runs, little scraped-out hollows under rusted-out cars quietly going to pieces on the roadside. It was an act of security gained from long habit in the Kurian Zone: to not be where a Reaper might be poking around, looking for a victim. \"That\u0027s what death is, right? Just going to sleep forever. Unless a Reaper gets you. I wonder if the Kurians can mess with you, you know, even after death. Like it\u0027s hell or whatever.\" \"That\u0027s silly.\" Actually, it wasn\u0027t. Valentine had seen living bodies, suspended in tanks in a death that wasn\u0027t death, in one great, skyline-dominating tower in Seattle. \"They almost got me this trip. You think my luck\u0027s used up, Val?\" Maybe that was at the heart of her dark mood, drinking, and odd talk. \"You\u0027re too smart for \u0027em,\" Valentine said. Valentine escorted her up to his room at headquarters. Though the room had his name on a piece of cardboard taped next to the door, he rarely slept there, preferring to be in the little bungalow by the battalion. \"Remember crossing Kansas?\" Duvalier said as they went up the wide stairs with big corner landings. \"You were always up making breakfast. I woke up and there you\u0027d be, frying eggs in a pan in bacon fat. Then you\u0027d pour in some flour and make breading.\" \"It was to prevent you from dining out of garbage bins. The food\u0027s healthier when you cook it yourself. I suppose that\u0027s why I always fried it to hell. Fear of microbes.\" \"I thought it was delicious,\" Duvalier said, slipping out of her clothes. Which took a long time-she clothed her slight frame in multiple layers. \"Father Max used to say my cooking was made for Lent,\" Valentine said. He watched her undress. Not for pulchritudinous reasons; he wanted to make sure there was flesh on her ribs. She was a wanderer afoot, and the long miles left her scarecrow-thin. Valentine admired her knife-cut good looks, but wished she looked a little more like the sleek general\u0027s plaything she\u0027d been during Consul Solon\u0027s occupation than the bony adolescent raising the sheet next to him. \"Make me breakfast, Val. Make me some breakfast.\" \"Okay. You stop talking nonsense and get some sleep.\" \"Next to you. Like the old days.\" \"Sure.\" Valentine climbed into the bed. The queen-size mattress seemed extravagant, but then the estate owner considered anything under king fit only for the hired help. He\u0027d not lain naked next to a woman since the erotically mobile, lusty Tikka had gathered what was left of the Kentucky Alliance and harried the Moondaggers across Kentucky. Tikka had run through his inventory of sexual tricks, many acquired from an older Ohio doctor of highly specialized obstetrics, in a few marathon sessions that left her energized and Valentine exhausted but both happily relieved of the burdens of the Kentucky retreat during their few hours together. Last he\u0027d heard she\u0027d returned to the Bulletproof. He hoped she was one of the delegates in Elizabethtown. He felt some faint stirrings below the waist as Duvalier pressed her slight body against him, sighing contentedly. But the easygoing intimacy he and Duvalier shared wasn\u0027t physical, though they took comfort in the body heat and natural comfort of each other\u0027s frames when traveling together. Their intimacy might be compared to that of a brother and sister, but outside of black-cover gothic erotic romances, few sisters slept next to their brothers with pubic thatch tickling his thigh. No, they were more like a veteran married couple, finding reassurance in each other\u0027s bodies, knowing that they\u0027d wake up together or not at all-save that they\u0027d skipped the sex that usually led to such complacency and gone right to physical reassurance. The party went on until dawn and beyond. The next day he accompanied Lambert across the emptied camp to headquarters. The trampled-down, dead grass where the tents had been set up turned the parkland into something resembling a chessboard. They passed through to the CO\u0027s office. Bloom stood there, her files tied up in three big waterproof binders by her adjutant. She walked a little stiffly but kept the cane as more of an affectation than because she needed it for moving about the office. They exchanged the necessary salutes. \"Fort Seng is yours. What\u0027s left of it, anyway,\" Bloom said. She turned a bit pensive. \"Still wish I knew what they did to me when I got all scared,\" Bloom said. \"I never once the whole time felt my mind was not my own. I was just dark and depressed about everything. Doubtful. That ever happens to you, tell somebody right away.\" \"How were you to know?\" Valentine said. Lambert walked over to the east-facing windows and looked out at the Kentucky woods. \"Helluva way to fight: Make someone get so beat up about themselves they start thinking about taking their own life. I\u0027d rather be shot at some more.\" \"I understand that,\" Valentine said. \"What ifs-you know. What if I could have been stronger, or figured out something was wrong with me. Does it make you not crazy if you recognize that you\u0027re sick in the head? I remember knowing I felt different. I thought I was just cracking under the strain.\" \"You did better than anyone would have expected.\" \"It was beautiful for a minute, wasn\u0027t it? When we showed up and found the Green Mountain Boys there. Colonel Lambert, you know you did all that. Too bad you couldn\u0027t have seen it. Oh, that was a good day.\" Lambert turned back to face Bloom. \"They fooled me just as much as they fooled you. Wish I\u0027d been a little more careful.\" Valentine wondered if his repeated requests to Southern Command for assistance to be sent to Ahn-Kha\u0027s coal-country guerrillas figured into Lambert\u0027s calculus when she\u0027d decided on Javelin as Southern Command\u0027s next venture into the Kurian Zone. She knew Valentine, trusted him. Had he let her down? Maybe that\u0027s why she\u0027d been so formal of late. \"I think the Green Mountain Boys were happy to see Southern Command arrive too,\" Lambert added. \"It\u0027s still the spot Javelin landed, as far as I\u0027m concerned. I think we\u0027ll be back, one day.\" Bloom focused on Valentine. \"I\u0027m sorry, Val.\" \"Not your doing. I know you\u0027d have stuck.\" Bloom took a deep breath, brightened. \"At least everyone\u0027s rested and refit. We\u0027ll make it the rest of the way . . .\" \"Easy,\" Valentine said. \"I\u0027d settle for hard. One twist away from impossible, even, just so long as I get them home.\" Valentine stood flanking Lambert, watching the brigade walk out of camp under an iron gray sky. The soldiers moved in step-a rarity for the men of Southern Command, unless they were moving as part of a graduation class or parade review or under a general\u0027s nose. Valentine expected the Kurians would let them return across the Mississippi. The Kurians liked to see defeated men live to tell their tales. It was the ones who\u0027d beaten them they went after. Men like his father. It was hard watching the men he\u0027d come to know on the long advance and the longer retreat file off down the road. Of course, the few volunteers stayed on: some technical staff, communications people, and trainers helping transform the Quislings into something that could stand up to the Kurian Order. Even Galloby, the agronomist, had remained, waxing enthusiastic about learning more about legworm husbandry. He had some kind of idea about putting a special bacteria in the legworm\u0027s digestive tract and getting concentrated fertilizer from the other end. But while he put droplets into petri dishes and ran chemical tests, he advised Evansville on how they could do a better job growing their own food without the rest of Indiana to rely on. Pencil Boelnitz also stayed, and Valentine wasn\u0027t sure how to feel about that. The supply train left, and then some of the artillery Southern Command had brought in and were now towing out, and finally the rear guard departed, pushing burdened bicycles. Red Dog dodged in and out of their wheels to the turn into woods leading to the gate, then plopped down in the sun to pant. \"You ready for this, Dots?\" Valentine asked Lambert, using her old military college nickname in an effort to lighten the mood. \"No,\" she said, looking around as if she were seeing the tree lines of Fort Seng for the first time. Valentine chuckled. \"Too bad.\" \"You\u0027re helpful.\" \"I\u0027d be a lot more worried if you were more confident. What\u0027s my first order, sir?\" Valentine asked. Bloom\u0027s command car came roaring back into Fort Seng. Bloom hopped out before it even came to a stop, hauling with her a Kentucky \"vol\"-short for volunteer: a local who served in the loosest, most disorganized militia imaginable. Their only common element was a dark blue band around their baseball-style caps. Valentine smelled blood on him. \"The Kurians moved already. They didn\u0027t waste time. We aren\u0027t even out of camp yet,\" Bloom said. \"I\u0027m sorry I\u0027ve got to leave passing you bad news. Evansville just hauled this guy out of his boat.\" \"Where?\" Lambert said. The vol spoke up. \"It\u0027s lights-out for Evansville and Owensboro. A bunch of flying whatsits have taken over the power plant, and some Reapers and Moondaggers are holding the technical guys hostage.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/winter-duty-vampire-earth-8/page-5.html","bookId":2589,"book":{"id":2589,"title":"Winter Duty (Vampire Earth #8)","description":"Storyline: Winter Duty (Vampire Earth #8) Major David Valentine and his fugitive battalion are the remnants of an expeditionary force shattered in its long retreat from disaster in the Appalachians.
