{"id":95359,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Civilian and military relations: Southern Command has a long history of \"turnouts\" to offer assistance to civilians in need. Their ethic might almost be described by the words \"protect and serve.\" Bases always serve as a temporary haven for the lost, dispossessed, or desperate. The men and women in uniform know they depend on the civilian populace for food and support. There are endless tales of whole camps going hungry to share their rations with hard-up locals and their children. In return, civilians do what they can to provide for soldiers on the march, act as spare pairs of eyes and ears, and put in extra hours as poorly paid labor levies doing everything from laundry to garbage burial. Especially in frontier areas, the soldiers are the only law and order around. While they can\u0027t treat criminals as combatants, they do have the power to hold someone until they can be turned over to civilian authorities-and the farther out the base, the longer the wait for a marshal or judge riding circuit to appear. More important for this period in the turbulent history of the Middle Freestates, they can provide escort for vehicles, trains, and watercraft. For all Valentine\u0027s reluctance to join Mrs. O\u0027Coombe\u0027s famous and tragic trek to recover her son, the rest of Fort Seng worked like demons to prepare her group and vehicles for their journey. \"Home by Christmas,\" the men said to each other, hoping that ten days on the road would suffice to recover the men Javelin had left scattered across Kentucky. Each soldier could picture himself left behind somewhere. They provisioned and checked and armed the already well-equipped vehicles. For the average man in the ranks, letters from the president and connections in the general headquarters staff were remote facts, like the Hooked O-C straddling much of southern Oklahoma and northern Texas. What they understood was that the cots bolted to the inside of the trucks and vehicles would bring home those who\u0027d been left behind-at least those who survived their injuries and the sweeps of Javelin\u0027s trail by bloodthirsty Moondaggers. He met O\u0027Coombe\u0027s team on a warm December day. Valentine hadn\u0027t seen vehicles like these since the drive on Dallas, and these specimens were in much better condition. They sat there, not exactly gleaming in the sun but looking formidable in their grit and mud streaks. Mrs. O\u0027Coombe introduced him to her right-hand man, an ex-Bear named Stuck. Valentine hadn\u0027t met many ex-Bears. It seemed you were either a Bear or you were a deceased Bear; the ex-Bears he\u0027d met were all so badly damaged they couldn\u0027t stand up or hold a gun. Stuck had all his arms and legs and sensory organs intact. All that seemed to be missing was the bristling, grouchy Bear attitude. He was a big, meaty, soft-spoken man with a wide, angular mustache. Stuck took Valentine down the line. He introduced Valentine to the wagon master, Habanero, a tough older man, thin and dry and leathery as a piece of jerky. He had a combination hearing aid-radio communicator that he used to issue orders to the drivers in the column. \"Ex-artillery in the Guards,\" Stuck explained as they left to inspect the vehicles. \"Used to haul around guns. Deaf as a post but knows engines and suspensions and transmissions.\" First, there was Rover, the command car. It was a high-clearance model that looked like something out of an African safari, right down to a heavy cage around the cabin. Extra jerricans of water and gasoline festooned the back and sides, spare tires were mounted on the front and hood, packs were tied to the cage, and up top a pair of radio antennae bent from the rear bumpers and were tied forward like scorpion tails. The command car had a turret ring-empty for now. Stuck said there was an automatic grenade launcher and two bins of grenades in the bay. Then there was the Bushmaster. The vehicle was a beautiful, rust-free armored personnel carrier, long bodied with a toothy grin up front thanks to heavy brush breakers. An armored cupola sat at the top, and firing slits lined the side. Valentine saw canvas-covered barrels sprouting like antennae. \"Teeth as false as Grandpa\u0027s,\" Stuck said. Stuck glanced around before opening the armored car\u0027s back. The vehicle was under command of a thickset homunculus. The man looked like he\u0027d been folded and imperfectly unfolded again. Scarred, with a squint eye and an upturned mouth, his face looked as though someone had given his unformed face a vigorous stir with wooden spoon. Even his ears were uneven. Valentine recognized him. \"I know you, don\u0027t I?\" \"Yes, sir, thanks, sir,\" he said as they shook hands. \"March south to Dallas. We was just ahead of your Razorbacks in column with the old One hundred fifteenth. I drove a rocket sled.\" A vicious-looking dog that seemed mostly Doberman sniffed Valentine from next to the driver. Hazardous duty, since the rockets had a tendency to blow up in the crew\u0027s face. Southern Command had any number of improvised artillery units. Crude rocketry was popular because the howling, crashing projectiles unnerved even the most dug-in Grogs. Someone said it was because the rockets made a noise that sounded like the Grog word for lightning strikes. Valentine suspected it might be the other way around-that the Grogs started calling lightning strikes after the sound effect from the rockets. \"Dover-no, Drake. Your crew pulled my command car out of a mud hole outside Sulphur Springs.\" \"That we did, sir.\" \"Serves me right for taking the wheel. I never was much of a driver.\" Stuck spoke up. \"Drake here is on her ladyship\u0027s-Well, we call them the ranch\u0027s sheriff\u0027s deputies. He keeps law and order among the hands and their families.\" \"Not popular work, sir, but it pays well,\" Drake said. \"Quite a dog you have there,\" Valentine said, looking at the beast\u0027s scarred muscle. \"Can I pet it?\" \"You can, sir, but I wouldn\u0027t advise it. I don\u0027t even pet him.\" \"How\u0027s she drive, Drake?\" Valentine asked. \"Like steering a pig with handlebars shoved up its ass, but it\u0027ll get there and back,\" Drake said. \"Riot control platform, isn\u0027t it? I\u0027ve seen these in Illinois.\" \"That it is, sir.\" Stuck opened the small access hatch in the larger back door. \"We\u0027ve got it rigged out to carry injured in comfort.\" The tunnellike inside was full of twelve folding bunks attached to the walls of the vehicle, as well as seats along the walls: cushioned lockers. The bunks blocked some of the firing slits but not the cupola. The machine guns looked more frightening from the outside, thanks to the big barrels. Inside, they were revealed to be assault rifles rigged out with box magazines. Still, firepower is firepower. \"What\u0027s up top? A broomstick?\" Valentine asked. \"Oh, the gun\u0027s real enough,\" Drake said. \"Twenty millimeters of lead that\u0027ll turn any breathing target into dog meat, from a Reaper to a legworm.\" \"Dogs know better than to eat off a dead Reaper,\" Stuck said. Next in line was the Chuckwagon. It was a standard military truck with an armored-up cabin, a mounted machine gun at the back, and a twin-tank trailer dragging behind. The paint job and new tires made Javelin\u0027s venerable and road-worn Comanche look like the tired old army mule she was. The Chuckwagon towed a trailer with two big black tanks on it. The hood was up on this one, and a plump behind wiggled as a woman in overalls inspected the engine. \"Ma,\" Stuck shouted. \"There\u0027s someone needs meeting.\" \"Busy here.\" \"You\u0027re never that busy. Come out of there.\" A plump, graying woman hopped down from the front bumper. She wiped her hands and gave a wave Valentine decided to interpret as friendly gesture instead of sloppy contempt. \"This is Ma, one of the ranch\u0027s roving cooks. Ex-Southern Command and ex-Logistics Commando, she\u0027s our expert on Tennessee and Kentucky.\" \"Really only know it to the Tennessee River, but from the Goat Shack to Church Dump, I\u0027ve been up and down her. My specialty was likker, of course, but I traded in parts and guns too.\" Valentine nodded. \"I\u0027ll put you to work on this trip. We need medical supplies and-\" \" \u0027Scuse me, sir, but I don\u0027t know medicinals; never had much of a mind for \u0027em. Too easy to get stock-shuffled or wheezed or lose it all in the old Bayou flush. Easier to spot a true rifle barrel or bourbon from busthead.\" Finally, there was the Boneyard, a military ambulance truck. It had the same basic frame as the Rover, with a longer back end and higher payload bay. A bright red cross against a white background decorated its hood and flanks. \"Doc and the nurse are helping out in your hospital,\" Stuck said. \"The driver\u0027s name is Big Gustauf, old Missouri German. My guess is he\u0027s eating. Never was a Bear as far as I know, but he\u0027s got the appetite of one.\" Valentine paced back up the column and found the matriarch who\u0027d assembled all this to bring her boy home. \"I\u0027d like to congratulate you on your column, Mrs. O\u0027Coombe.\" She offered a friendly tip of the head in return for the compliment. \"When we were young my husband and I ranched right into Nomansland,\" she said. \"Hard years. Dangerous years. I knew what to bring on such an expedition.\" \"I hope your care obtains results.\" \"That\u0027s in God\u0027s hands, Mister Valentine. All I can do is my best.\" \"God usually fights on the side of the better prepared,\" Valentine said. \"I don\u0027t care for your sense of humor, Mister Valentine, but as an experienced soldier I suspect you\u0027ve earned your cynicism.\" \"Your son didn\u0027t serve under the name O\u0027Coombe, did he?\" Valentine asked. \"No, he didn\u0027t want to be pestered for money or jobs for relatives,\" Mrs. O\u0027Coombe said. \"He served under my maiden name, Rockaway. Sweet of him, was it not, Mister Valentine?\" Valentine made a note of that. He\u0027d have to check the roll call records and medical lists to learn which legworm clan ended up taking care of him. They had left only a handful of wounded behind who seemed likely to survive, and even then only in areas controlled by their allied clans. \"How much do you know about Kentucky?\" Valentine asked. \"My sources say there are many off-road trails thanks to the feeding habits of the legworms. I wanted vehicles that could use poorly serviced roads and even those trails.\" \"How did you get vehicles like these together?\" Valentine asked. When he\u0027d first seen her, he wondered if she\u0027d hired mer cenaries. They knew about moving off-road with a column of vehicles. They had plenty of tow chains and cables ready to offer assistance to the next in line or the previous. He noticed the various trucks\u0027 engines had cloth cowlings stitched and strapped over them. The cloth had an interesting sheen. Valentine suspected it was Reaper cloth from their robes. \"Get them? Sir, they\u0027re from our ranch. We control property that covers hundreds of square miles. The ranch wouldn\u0027t function without range-capable wheels.\" \"Where do you ride?\" Valentine asked Stuck. He lifted a muscular, hairy arm and pointed to a pair of heavy motorcycles with leather saddlebags and rifle clips on the handlebars. \"Me and Longshot are the bikers.\" \"Where\u0027s Longshot?\" Valentine asked. \"Up here,\" he heard a female voice say. Valentine looked up and saw a woman in old-fashioned biker leathers sunning herself atop the Bushmaster. She zipped up her jacket. \"I\u0027m the scout sniper.\" She had strong Indian features, dirtied from riding her motorcycle. There was a clean pattern around where she presumably wore her goggles. You wouldn\u0027t necessarily call her \"pretty\" or \"beautiful.\" Striking was more like it, with strong features and long black hair that put Valentine\u0027s to shame. \"Comanche?\" Valentine asked. \"Hell if I know. Tucumcari mutt: little bit of everything. You?\" \"North Minnesota mix,\" Valentine said. \"Hey, want to see me feed these beasts?\" Stuck asked. Valentine nodded. He walked over to the Chuckwagon\u0027s trailer. It had big twin tanks that Valentine had assumed were powered by gasoline or diesel or vegetable oil. Longshot hopped down, and Stuck opened a latched cooler strapped on a little platform between the tanks. Two buckets rested inside. A ripe fecal smell came out, so powerful it almost billowed. Valentine watched Stuck and Longshot, apparently oblivious to the odor, each lift a bucket and pour it into one of the tanks. \"Everyone pisses and shits in the old honeybucket,\" Stuck said. \"Food scraps are good too, especially carbohydrates.\" Stuck took a leather lanyard from around his neck. Valentine noticed a Reaper thumb on it, interesting only thanks to an overlarge, pointed nail capping it. The lanyard also had two keys. Stuck used one of them to open a locked box on the tanker trailer and took out a plastic jug of blue-white crystals with a metal scoop sunk in. \"This is my job. I check the test strips and seed.\" He extracted a long dipstick from the fragrant tank, wiped it on a piece of paper about the size of a Band-Aid, carefully placed the test paper in a clip, and held it up to a color-coded, plasticized sheet. Nodding, he made a notation on a clipboard that rested on the box\u0027s hinged cover. \"The Kurians guard this stuff like the Reaper cloth factories,\" Stuck said, leveling and dumping three roughly teaspoon-sized portions of the granules into the larger scoop. \"I\u0027ve seen those factories,\" Valentine said. \"Or one of them, anyway, in the Southwest.\" \"This tank\u0027s just about done,\" Stuck said. \"Takes about thirty-six hours to do three hundred fifty gallons. Then we refill off this tank while we fill the other with waste, or pig corn, or melon rinds, or what have you. In a pinch, these engines can run off of kerosene, regular diesel, or even waste cooking oil, but this stuff\u0027s easier on \u0027em, and Habby doesn\u0027t bitch about changing gunked-up fuel filters.\" Valentine watched him dump the crystals into the conversion tank. \"Always makes me wish I\u0027d learned more science and chemistry and stuff, instead of just getting good at taking Reapers and Grogs apart,\" Stuck said. \"So where did you get that stuff? I\u0027ve never even heard of it,\" Valentine said. \"The Great Dame is friends with some big bug in Santa Fe. He\u0027s playing both sides of the border, scared there\u0027ll be a reckoning if Denver Freehold and Southern Command pair up and hit the Southwest. He\u0027s a honcho in transport. Keeps trying to propose, but she shoots him down.\" \"What\u0027s your story, Stuck?\" \"I was never cut out for military life, even as a Bear. Hurry up and wait, hurry up and wait. Drove me crazy. Stand here, look there, turn your head and cough, bend over and pull \u0027em apart. Not my lifestyle at all. Mrs. O\u0027Coombe keeps me busy out in the open where I\u0027m alone, riding from post to post checking security. No one to piss me off that way.\" He looked up from the mix. \"Longshot, get over here,\" Stuck said. \"What do you think of this color?\" \"More water,\" she said. \"That\u0027s what I thought. Thanks.\" She hopped down and bumped into Valentine. Valentine found himself looking into the reversed-raccoon eyes of the girl. The face mask had left an odd pattern on her features. Dusky and dark, she reminded him a little of Malita, save that Longshot was a good deal shorter. \"You must love your bike,\" Valentine said. \"I was out scouting east of here this morning,\" she said. \"Longshot gets bored easily,\" Stuck said, watching her grab a washcloth and towel and head for the camp\u0027s showers. \"She\u0027s a retired guerrilla from down Mexico way. Met her during Operation Snakebite. She\u0027s ridden at my side ever since.\" \"Full partnership, or limited liability?\" Valentine asked. \"Nah. A Reaper yanked my gear off when I was captured in \u0027sixty-six. Didn\u0027t hurt as much as you\u0027d think, but about all she does is keep me warm.\" Valentine had a hard decision to make, and after consulting Lambert, he presented it to Mrs. O\u0027Coombe the night before their scheduled departure. \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll have to commandeer your doctor for Fort Seng, Mrs. O\u0027Coombe. Our remaining doctor is exhausted. He\u0027s worked seven days a week for over a month now.\" \"And just who do you suggest will look after my son or any wounded we recover?\" \"We\u0027ll take our nurse. If they\u0027ve lived this long, I doubt they\u0027ll need any more care than that.\" \"I\u0027m sorry, Mister Valentine, but this is one time I must tell you no. I don\u0027t like the idea of traveling with wounded without a doctor.\" \"A nurse should be sufficient for travel,\" Valentine said. And that was that. He had rank, after all, and it would take months for Mrs O\u0027Coombe to get her friends to exert their influence for or against him. And by then he hoped to have her son back. Valentine passed the word and names for an officers\u0027 call and then arranged for food to be sent up to what was now being called the map room. Next to the communications center, it had formerly been a game room. Lambert had altered it so it featured everything from a large-scale map of Kentucky to an updated map of the Evansville area, river charts, and even a globe Lambert had colored with crayons to reflect resistance hot spots against the Kurian Order. Lambert was a whirlwind. Somebody had a screw loose if they had just cast this woman aside as part of a political housecleaning. Gamecock was there representing his Bears, Frat for the Wolves, and Duvalier just because she saw the others gathering and wanted to grab a comfortable armchair. Patel was present, of course, and Colonel Bloom\u0027s new executive officer, a Guard lieutenant who\u0027d distinguished himself at the bridge where Bloom had been wounded on Javelin\u0027s retreat. \"You looking forward to your trip, suh?\" Gamecock said. \"We won\u0027t be touring. I don\u0027t care how well equipped and crewed she is. If she\u0027s recovering Southern Command forces, we need Southern Command along. I think she\u0027s sailing into trouble.\" \"Isn\u0027t she a bit old for you, Val?\" Duvalier asked. \"You can come along and keep an eye on me,\" Valentine said. He hadn\u0027t yet told her that he wanted her to as part of his command. \"No walking, I hope,\" Duvalier said, with a light laugh that did Valentine\u0027s spirits good. She\u0027d been so moody lately. \"Twice back and forth across the state is enough for me.\" \"Who would you like to bring, sir?\" Patel asked. Valentine looked at his notes. \"I\u0027d like to take two Bears-Chieftain and Silvertip-four Wolves, and a nurse.\" \"Who\u0027s bringing the beer and barbecue?\" Duvalier asked. \"Do I have to remind you that this is an officers\u0027 call, Captain?\" Valentine said, using her titular rank. \"Then I\u0027ll join the tour,\" Duvalier said. \"Call it a survey, call it a reconnaissance in force, call it a recovery operation. Call it anything you like. It\u0027s my intent to have a mobile force of some strength who knows how to deal with Reapers. With the legworm clans encamped for the winter, they\u0027ll be so many sitting ducks for whatever vengeance Missionary Doughnut is talking about.\" \"Goodwill tour it is,\" Lambert said. \"Our friend out front has never made much sense. Seeing some Southern Command forces in Kentucky\u0027s heartland will do the Cause some good, in any case. And let\u0027s not forget our outgoing president\u0027s letter. If I go myself, I\u0027ll consider my duties discharged.\" \"Can I go with my Wolves, sir?\" Frat asked. \"I\u0027d like to see a little more of Kentucky.\" Valentine looked at Lambert, who nodded. \"Glad to have you along, Lieutenant. Thanks for volunteering. You\u0027ll save me a lot of legwork.\" Duvalier snickered at that. Valentine wondered why she was so merry this morning. Alarm. Valentine came out of his sleep, heart pounding, a terrible sense that death stood over his pillow. The Valentingle. He hadn\u0027t called it that at first. If he thought about it, he might have remembered that he once called it \"the willies\" or \"the creeps.\" The name came from his companions in the Wolves, who learned to trust his judgment about when they were safe to take refuge for the night-what hamlets might be visited quietly, whispering to the inhabitants through back porch screens. Whether it was sixth sense, the kind of natural instinct that makes a rabbit freeze when a hawk\u0027s shadow passes overhead, or some strange gift of the Lifeweavers, Valentine couldn\u0027t say. But he did trust it. A Reaper was prowling. Valentine slipped into his trousers and boots almost at the same time, tying them in the dark. He grabbed the pistol belt hanging on his bedpost. Next came the rifle. Valentine checked his ammunition by touch, inserted a magazine, chambered a shot. He slung on his sword. Oddly enough, the blade was more comforting than even the guns. There was something atavistic in having a good handle grip at the end of an implement you can wave about. Duvalier would say that it wasn\u0027t atavism. . . . Valentine hand-cranked his field phone. \"Operations.\" \"Operations,\" they answered. \"This is Major Valentine. Any alerts?\" He swapped hands with the receiver so he could pull on his uniform shirt. \"Negative, Major Valentine.\" \"Well, I\u0027m calling one. Pass the word: alert alert alert. I want to hear from the sentries by the time I get down there.\" The communications center lay snug in the basement. Valentine looked out the window. The alarm klaxon went off, sending black birds flapping off the garbage dump and a raccoon scuttling. Emergency lights tripped on in quick succession. They were perhaps not as bright as Southern Command\u0027s sodium lights that illuminated woods on the other side of the parking lot, but they had precise coverage that left no concealing shadows on the concentric rings of decorative patio stones. The old estate house had quite a security system. A shadow whipped across the lawn, bounding like a decidedly unjolly black giant, covering three meters at a stride, a dark cloak flapping like wings. Reaper! Could it be their old friend from the Ohio? The clothing was different, it seemed. The other one hadn\u0027t even had a cloak and cowl when he\u0027d last seen it, and it seemed doubtful that a wild Reaper could attain one. Valentine, in more of a hurry to throw off the shutters and open the sash than ever any St. Nick-chasing father, fumbled with the window. He knocked it open at the cost of a painful pinch to his finger when the rising pane caught him. He swung his legs out and sat briefly on the sill like a child working up the nerve to jump, rifle heavy across his thighs. Valentine had no need to nerve himself, but he did want one last look at the Reaper\u0027s track from the advantage of height. Would it angle toward the soldiers\u0027 tents or the munitions dugout? Kurians had been known to sacrifice a Reaper, if it meant blowing up half a base. It did neither. It headed straight for the woods south, toward the river. Valentine jumped, felt the cool night air rush up his trouser legs. He landed on his good leg, cradling the rifle carefully against his midsection as though it were a baby. With that he was off, settling into his old Wolf lope, the bad leg giving him the port-and-starboard sway of a tipsy sailor or perhaps an off-balance metronome. He cast about with a coonhound\u0027s frantic anxiety at the edge of the woods. The tracks were there, hard to see in the deep night of the woods. Only the Reaper\u0027s furious pace allowed him to find the tracks at all. Valentine searched the woods with his hard ears. The wind was smothering whatever sounds the Reaper made-if it was in fact running and not just trying to lure him into the woods. Deciding on handiness over firepower, Valentine slung his rifle. Drawing his pistol and sword, he tucked the blade under his arm and began stalking into the woods with the pistol in a solid, two-handed \"teacup\" grip, searching more with his ears than his eyes. His footfalls sounded like land mines detonating to his nervous ears. Of course, anyone venturing into thick woods after a Reaper would be a madman not to be nervous. Motion out of the corner of his eye- Valentine swung, the red fluorescent dot on the pistol\u0027s foresight tracking through wooded night to . . . A chittering raccoon, blinking at him from a tree branch. Valentine lowered the pistol barrel. In a cheap horror movie, this would be the moment for the Reaper to come up behind. Valentine turned a full circle. The woods were empty. A half hour later he\u0027d traced the tracks to an old road running along the bank of the Ohio River above the flood line. Above what was technically the flood line, that is; the road showed evidence of having survived at least one flood. The Reaper could have continued on to the river or headed down the road in either direction. It might even have stashed a bicycle somewhere-a Reaper could reach a fantastic speed on two wheels. Now all that was left was the grim accounting. Perhaps the Reaper had grabbed some poor sentry and terrified him into giving an estimate of their reduced strength once Bloom had departed. There\u0027d be a name to report missing and fear in the camp. Such a loss would be worse to take than an ambush or a fire-fight, where at least the men could feel like they shot back. A single man\u0027s death after so many weeks without a casualty worse than a broken ankle would loom all the larger over dinner conversation. It took three hours for word to come back to the alarmed operations center: all in-fort personnel present and accounted for, from the most distant sentry to the cook stocking potatoes in one of the basements against the winter. One other person had caught a good look at the Reaper, and Valentine and Lambert heard the story from a shaken-up mechanic named Cleland, brought in by Frat, who\u0027d found him in crouched on the unpleasant side of a board over a pit toilet and helped him out. Cleland was up late winterproofing a pump, went to the cookhouse for a hot sandwich and coffee, and saw a tall figure standing silhouetted against one of the security lights. \"Just looked like he was trying to keep warm, wrapped up. Didn\u0027t notice how tall he was right off as I was headin\u0027 up the hill, you know.\" Valentine\u0027s nose noted that Cleland hadn\u0027t done the most thorough job cleaning up before giving his report. \"Standing in the light?\" Valentine asked. \"Turned toward it, more like. I saw something in its hand.\" \"He needed light,\" Lambert said, looking at Valentine. \"It\u0027s a dark night.\" \"Could you see what it was?\" Valentine asked. \"Piece of paper, maybe. It shoved whatever it was into its cloak when it heard me. Damn thing looked right at me. Yellow eyes. Nobody ever told me how bright they were. A man doesn\u0027t forget that. Don\u0027t think I ever will.\" \"What then?\" \"I ran like the devil. Or like the devil was after me, more like. Dodged through the transport-lot and jumped into the old latrine.\" \"You can go, Cleland,\" Lambert said. \"Get a drink if you like at the hospital. Medicinal bourbon.\" \"What do you think?\" Lambert asked Valentine after Cleland left. Valentine looked at the alert report. \"They found a garbage can overturned by the cookhouse. Could be raccoons again.\" \"A Reaper snuck onto the base to go through our garbage? Not even the garbage at headquarters; a can full of greasy wax paper and coffee grounds?\" Valentine had the same uncomfortable feeling he\u0027d had on his first trip into the Kurian Zone, when he learned that one of his charges had been leaving information for Kurian trackers. \"A message drop,\" Valentine said. \"Possibly. People go to the canteen at all hours. It\u0027s a good spot. Almost everyone\u0027s there once a day.\" \"That means-it could be anyone.\" \"In a camp full of Quislings,\" Lambert said. \"Not anymore . . . at least I hope not,\" Valentine said. Lambert lowered her voice. \"They turned on their superiors once. We have to consider the possibility that they\u0027ll do it again. How many of them are above going for a brass ring and an estate in Iowa?\" \"Will you take tea with me, Mister Valentine?\" Mrs. O\u0027Coombe asked as Valentine passed through her mini-camp on a blustery afternoon with blown leaves rattling against the Rover\u0027s paneling. \"You look chilled.\" Valentine had no need to be anywhere. The column was waiting for a report from the Kentuckians about the status of their wounded left behind, not to mention offical permission to move through the new Freehold with an armed column. \"Yes. I would like to talk to you.\" \"Tea elevates any social interaction,\" she said, placing an elegant copper pot on the electrical camp stove running off the generator. Valentine admired the long spout and handle. The decorative top had elaborate etching. She opened a tin and spooned some black leaves into the holder at the top of the pot. \"You\u0027ll forgive me-I make some ceremony of this,\" she said. \"Teatime was always my time on the ranch. Even my husband, God rest him, didn\u0027t disturb me if I closed my library door.\" She poured. \"Tea is the smell of civilization, don\u0027t you think?\" Valentine sniffed, briefly bringing the old mental focus to his nostrils. Not a strong scent, even to his old Wolf nose. Just wet leaves and hot water. \"Not much of a smell.\" Valentine said. \"I\u0027ve heard people put, er, that oil, berge-\" \"Bergamot,\" she corrected. \"Yes, Earl Grey. A classic. Not that hard to make. Are you a fan of teas, Mister Valentine?\" \"I used to drink some good stuff in New Orleans. Lots of trade there. I had sage tea in Texas. I trade my whiskey and tobacco rations for tea, the Southern Command stuff.\" \"Dusty mud,\" she said. \"These are real leaves, from China and India.\" They drank. Valentine sniffed again, letting his Wolf\u0027s nose explore the pleasantly delicate aroma. \"No, it\u0027s not a strong smell,\" she said. \"But then civilization isn\u0027t a strong presence either. The whole idea is the sublimation of coarser practices. Yet when it disappears-just as when your cup is empty-you\u0027ll notice its absence more. Receiving mail is an ordinary experience until it doesn\u0027t show up for a week; then its interruption is keenly felt.\" \"We\u0027d like nothing better than weekly mail out here.\" \"How is the bond tour going, Mister Valentine?\" \"Poorly, I\u0027m afraid. These Kentuckians keep their gold close. We\u0027ve had some donations of whiskey, boots, and craft goods that we might be able to trade for butter and eggs, if we come across a farm wife in a patriotic mood. You\u0027ll see that on the road.\" \"I am anxious to get started. I wish to see my son again.\" \"You know, there\u0027s a chance we may never find Corporal O\u0027Coombe.\" Valentine thought it better not to list all the reasons-sepsis, an illness, discovery by Moondaggers sweeping across Javelin\u0027s line of retreat looking for those left behind to take and torture . . . \"I\u0027ve prepared myself for that eventuality, Mister Valentine.\" \"You seem like a woman used to getting her way. I hope we\u0027ll be able to complete our sweep and bring back a few more of Southern Command\u0027s own.\" \"My staff and their vehicles are entirely at your disposal, sir. Our agreement still stands. I am allowed to search for my son; you are allowed to bring back any you have left behind. If we cannot find news of my son, all I ask is a finding that he\u0027s been killed in action so that his memory may be honored accordingly.\" Valentine would be glad to have Mrs. O\u0027Coombe\u0027s crew out of his graying hair. Her precious doctor was always asking for better water, more sanitizer, more hands to pick up shifts changing bandages and bedding. In the end, Mrs. O\u0027Coombe\u0027s doctor came along after all, but only after the remaining Javelin doctor personally spoke to Valentine and explained that having a doctor along might mean the difference between a continued recovery and a setback as they moved the wounded. Though Valentine wondered how much of a specialist Mrs. O\u0027Coombe\u0027s doctor really was. He went by the unimaginative moniker of \"Doc\" and seemed more like a country sawbones than an expert in difficult recoveries, though his nurse, a thick-fingered Louisiana-born woman named Sahita, had the serene, slightly blank look of an experienced caregiver. Sahita looked at the entire world through narrowed eyes and seemed naturally immune to chitchat, responding only in monosyllables if at all possible to any conversational efforts. Valentine and Frat did a final inspection before boarding the vehicles. Food, clothing, gear, guns. Everyone a first-aid kit, everyone a tool for finding food or making shelter. Frat had a big shoulder bag over his arm as well, stuffed with maps and battered old guidebooks to Kentucky. Valentine was rather touched by the imitation, if that\u0027s what it was rather than coincidence. Though Frat had avoided choosing a diaper bag for his miscellany. Inspection complete and vehicles pronounced ready, they boarded their transport and put the engines in gear. Despite his misgivings, Valentine was relieved to be on the move at last. The sooner they started, the sooner he could return. The vehicles rolled out of Fort Seng in column order the next morning. The motorcycles blatted out first, followed by Rover with Valentine riding shotgun and Mrs. O\u0027Coombe in back, looking for all the world like an annoying mother-in-law in a comedy of the previous century. Duvalier slumped next to her, head pillowed on her rolled-up overcoat, already settling in to sleep. Bee had reluctantly taken a place in the Bushmaster behind but soon amused herself by unloading magazines, cleaning the bullets, and reloading the magazines. The rest of the camouflage-painted parade followed. Valentine had a big, comfortable seat, and there was a clip for his rifle in the dashboard. A clever little map or reading light could be bent down from the ceiling, and there was even a little case in the seat for a pair of binoculars or maps or sandwiches or books or whatever else you might desire on a long trip. For such a wretched, ungoverned, miserable place, the Old World sure put a lot of thought into conveniences, Valentine thought ironically. Of course a New Universal churchman would counter that the conveniences applied to only one half of one percent of the world\u0027s population. Habanero the wagon master controlled the wheel and gearshift in Rover, his earpiece in and a little control pad on his thigh that allowed him to radio the other drivers. He gave Valentine an extension so he could plug in to listen-and to speak if he had to. In the cabin of Rover, Valentine felt his usual isolation from the outside world when riding in a vehicle. While he enjoyed the comfort and convenience, you lost much of the appreciation of landscape and distance, proper humility before wind and weather. Of course he couldn\u0027t overlook the advantages an engine and wheels gave when you had two hundred miles to cover in search of your scattered wounded. The pleasant, ten-minute walk to the gate took but a moment in Rover. \"Slow here,\" Valentine said as they approached the gate and the doughnut-selling missionary. \"You need to install a drive-up window,\" Valentine yelled from his rolled-down window. He\u0027d been saving up the jibe all morning. \"Wise of you,\" the missionary said. \"Oh, it\u0027s you, my brother and friend. I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve decided to bow to the inevitable. But time runs short! Hurry! Go like Lot and his wife and do not look back.\" \"Sorry to disappoint,\" Valentine said, getting out to claim a final doughnut for the road. \"We\u0027re not leaving. We\u0027re just off to do a little touring. Would you recommend the Corvette museum in Bowling Green or the Lincoln birthplace?\" Behind, he heard Duvalier get out, yawning. \"I weep for you,\" the missionary said. \"You\u0027re all dead, you know. A reckoning is coming. Weeds have sprouted in Kentucky\u0027s green gardens, and it is time for the gardeners to replant. But first, the scythes and the cutters. Scythes and cutters, I say.\" \"They better be sharper than you,\" Duvalier said. \"It\u0027s a sad-\" \"Wait a moment,\" Valentine said. \"What\u0027s this about, you? What scythes, what cutters? I don\u0027t believe in visions unless they\u0027re specific.\" \"Oh, it\u0027s coming, sir. Sooner than anyone expects.\" He looked up and down the column. \"You have one final chance to repent. Turn west and follow the sun. If you turn east, by your actions is Kentucky doomed. You sow the seeds of your own destruction.\" \"Shut up, you,\" one of the Wolves yelled from the Chuckwagon. \"Want us to gag him with his own pastries?\" Frat called to Valentine. Valentine held up his hand, halting the Wolves in their tracks. \"How does a man like you come by such intelligence?\" The doughnut missionary grinned. He passed a finger down his nose. \"I prayed and I learned over many long years. But I too had faults: pride and greed and lust. I was cast out to make my way among the heathen. But they did not take all my gifts. I still have my vision.\" \"False prophecy. I\u0027ve seen no portents. Red sunsets before the Kurians ever move, my mother always told me. Long red sunsets and dawns, with blood on the clouds.\" \"Whispers on the wind, you poor soul. That\u0027s how I know. Whispers on the wind.\" \"Would that the wind were a little clearer.\" \"I hear voices, you poor lost soul. See visions. Visions! Oh, they break the heart.\" \"I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re so burdened. How long have you carried that cross?\" \"Had them since I was little. Born in a Church hall, the New England Archon\u0027s own retreat it was, but a grim place and nothing but lessons from the time I took my first step. That\u0027s no way to serve the gods, no sir, not for me. I ran away as soon as I could climb over the wall and never looked back. Took up with some relief and reassurance workers and then signed up for the missions, first in group and then alone and with only faith and my poor wit. Been warning souls away from folly and death ever since.\" Valentine took out his pocket notebook. \"How long before our day of judgment? I\u0027d like to make some preparations. Will, disposition of assets, and so forth.\" \"That I can\u0027t tell you. Soon, though, sir. Soon. This will be a cruel winter, and many won\u0027t live to see the spring. I say again: Repent now and leave Kentucky!\" Valentine decided he\u0027d heard all the detail he\u0027d ever hear from the doughnut missionary, and he climbed back into Rover. \"Why do you let that thing carry on so, Mister Valentine?\" Mrs. O\u0027Coombe said. \"It insults every faculty of taste and reason.\" \"The men like his doughnuts,\" Valentine said. A few had hopped out of the column to claim theirs. Valentine saw Frat hurl his into the man\u0027s face as they pulled away. Mrs. O\u0027Coombe snorted. \"I heard a little of him on the way in. I wouldn\u0027t give one of his clots of dough to one of my dogs. Sugar and lard. Mark my words, Mister Valentine, he\u0027s trying to clog their arteries or give your men diabetes. Now, tell me, should we turn east immediately, or should we go south and pick up the old parkway?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/winter-duty-vampire-earth-8/page-9.html","bookId":2589,"book":{"id":2589,"title":"Winter Duty (Vampire Earth #8)","description":"Storyline: Winter Duty (Vampire Earth #8) Major David Valentine and his fugitive battalion are the remnants of an expeditionary force shattered in its long retreat from disaster in the Appalachians.
