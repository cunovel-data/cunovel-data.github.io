{"id":30516,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. A JUVENILE DETECTIVE.","content":"Flip was a small dried-up looking boy, born and brought up in a London slum. He had no parents--at least, none that he could remember, and had he been asked how he came into existence, he would probably have answered Topsy-like that he \"growed.\" His mother and father had both deserted him at an early age, giving him nothing to remember them by, not even a name, so he was thrown on the world a squalling brat. Nevertheless, he managed to get along somehow to the age of fifteen, at which period of his life Dowker chanced on him, and his prospects began to improve. Dowker, underneath his drab exterior, concealed a kind heart, and, having met Flip one night in the rain, had taken compassion on the miserable morsel of humanity, and given him a cup of coffee to warm him and a roll of bread to satisfy his hunger. Flip was so touched at this disinterested kindness that he attached himself with dog-like fidelity to the detective, and tried to serve him to the best of his small ability. Having had to fight his way in the world, Flip had developed a wonderful sharpness of intellect at a very early age, and Dowker turned this hunger-educated instinct to good account, for he often set the little urchin to follow cabs, run messages, and do other small matters which he required. Flip performed all these duties so well and promptly that Dowker began to take an interest in him, and set to work to cultivate this stunted flower which had sprung up amid the evil weeds of the slums. He had a meeting place appointed with Flip in Drury Lane, and, whenever he wanted him, went there to seek him out. Flip listened to his patron\u0027s instructions carefully, and, having a wonderfully tenacious memory of an uncivilized kind, he never forgot what he was told. In return for services rendered, Dowker gave him a shilling a week, and on this small sum Flip managed to exist, with occasional help from casual passers-by. Dowker did not give him an education or dress him in decent clothes, as he thought this would spoil his instinct and appearance, both of which were essentially useful in their own particular way, so Flip remained ragged and ignorant; but it was his patron\u0027s intention to give him a chance of rising in the world when he grew older. He had no name except Flip, and the origin of that was a mystery--no clothes except a pair of baggy trousers and a tattered shirt--and his home was a noisome den in the purlieus of Drury Lane. His language was bad, so was his conduct; yet this small scrap of neglected humanity had in him the makings of a useful member of society. There are many such in London, but the Christians of England prefer to help the savages who don\u0027t want them to the savages who do. The Chickaboo Indians have existed for centuries without morals, religion, or clothes, and can very well exist for a longer period while the ragged denizens of the most civilized city in the world are being relieved. Everyone in London knows Drury Lane, that quaint, dirty narrow street leading to the Strand. The very name conjures up the shades of Siddons and Garrick, and the neighbourhood is sacred to the Dramatic Muse. Who has not seen that weather-stained picturesque house from the window of which gossipy old Pepys saw Mistress Nell Gwynne leaning out and watching the milkmaids go down to the Strand Maypole for the pleasant old English dance. But, alas! Nell and the milkmaids with their quaint chronicler have long since passed into the outer darkness--even the Maypole has become but a memory, yet the grim tumble down house still remains in the dirty lane. \u0027Tis a far cry from Charles to Victoria, and the merry milkmaids with their clinking pails have given place to frowsy old women, battered-looking young ones, and a ragged mixture of men and boys. Not an unpicturesque scene, this dilapidated-looking crowd, slouching over the rugged stones, and an artist would have stopped and admired them, but Dowker was not an artist, so looked not for scenic effect, but for Flip. Flip was sitting considering at the edge of the pavement with his feet, for the sake of coolness, in the gutter, and his eyes fixed on three dirty pennies lying in his own dirty brown palm. \"\u0027Am,\" said Flip, deliberating over the expenditure of his fortune. \"\u0027Am an\u0027 bread, an\u0027 a swig o\u0027 beer--my h\u0027eye, wot a tuck h\u0027out I\u0027ll \u0027ave. \u0027Ere,\" suddenly, as Dowker touched him with his foot, \"what the blazes are you kicking? Why I\u0027m blest if \u0027taint the guv\u0027nor.\" He jumped to his feet, and slipped the pennies into the waistband of his trousers, which did duty with him for a pocket. \"Wot\u0027s h\u0027up, guv\u0027nor,\" he asked with a leer. Flip\u0027s leer was not pleasant--it had such an unholy appearance, \"more larks--my h\u0027eye, I thort I\u0027d never twig you agin. \u0027Ave you bin h\u0027over the gardin-wall arter a prig?\" \"Hold your tongue,\" said Dowker sharply. \"I want you to do something for me--are you hungry?\" \"Not much,\" said Flip coolly, \"but I don\u0027t mind a \u0027am san\u0027wich.\" Dowker cast a sharp glance at the ragged little figure walking beside him. \"Where have you been getting money?\" he asked. \"My h\u0027eye, it\u0027s a rigler game,\" said Flip, rubbing his grimy hands together, as they turned into a ham and beef shop, \"I\u0027ll tell yer all--\u0027am I\u0027ll \u0027ave, an\u0027 bread.\" Being supplied with these luxuries at the expense of Dowker, Flip stuffed his mouth with a liberal portion and then began to talk. \"Larst Monday,\" he began. \"Ha,\" said Dowker, suddenly recollecting the date of the murder, \"yesterday?\" \"No, the Monday afore,\" said Flip, \"it were at nite, h\u0027awful foggy, my h\u0027eye, a rigler corker it were. I was as \u0027ungry as a bloomin\u0027 tyke an\u0027 couldn\u0027t find you nohow, so h\u0027up I goes to Soho to see h\u0027old Jem Mux, you know\u0027s \u0027im, guv\u0027nor, the cove as keeps the \u0027Pink \u0027Un.\u0027\" \"Yes, the sporting pub,\" replied Dowker. \"Same game,\" said Flip, \"\u0027e gives me sumat to eat when I arsks it, so I goes h\u0027up to cadge some wictuals, I gits cold meat, my h\u0027eye, prime, an\u0027 bread an\u0027 beer, so when I \u0027ad copped the grub, I was a-gittin\u0027 away h\u0027out of the bar when a swell cove comes in--lor\u0027 what a swell--fur coat an\u0027 a shiny \u0027at. Ses \u0027e to the gal, ses \u0027e, \u0027Is that \u0027ere sparrin\u0027 comin\u0027 ort this evenin\u0027?\u0027 \u0027Yes, says she, \u0027in the drorin\u0027-room.\u0027 \u0027Right you h\u0027are,\u0027 ses \u0027e, \u0027I want to see it afore I leave Hengland. I was a-goin\u0027 down to my yotsh,\u0027 ses \u0027e, but I\u0027ll put it orf till to-morrow as I wants to see this set to,\u0027 then \u0027e twigs me an\u0027 ses \u0027e, \u0027Are you cold?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 ses I. \u0027\u0027Ungry?\u0027 \u0027Not much,\u0027 ses I. \u0027\u0027Ere\u0027s some tin for you, you pore little devil,\u0027 an\u0027 I\u0027m blessed if \u0027e didn\u0027t tip me a sov, so I\u0027ve bin livin\u0027 like a dook on it since I sawr you--nice game, ain\u0027t it, guv\u0027nor?\" During this recital Dowker had not paid much attention till Flip spoke of the yacht, then he suddenly pricked up his ears, for it dawned on him that this unknown benefactor of Flip\u0027s might possibly be Lord Calliston. \"Monday night he was going out of town,\" murmured Dowker, \"but he was always a sporting blade, so perhaps he stopped for this fight and then went down next morning. I wonder where he met Lady Balscombe. Ah, well, it\u0027s nothing to do with the murder at all events; but I\u0027d like to know if he really did leave town on the night.\" Then he turned to Flip. \"Did the swell see Jem Mux?\" he asked sharply. \"Rather,\" said Flip, \"an\u0027 Jem \u0027e called \u0027im my lord, so \u0027e must \u0027ave been a bloomin\u0027 blindin\u0027 toff.\" \"My lord,\" repeated Dowker thoughtfully. \"Oh! no doubt it was Lord Calliston. I wonder if he\u0027s had anything to do with the death of his mistress, it\u0027s curious if he stopped in town all night that he didn\u0027t go back to his chambers. About what time was this?\" he asked aloud. \"About nine,\" said Flip promptly, \"or harf-parst.\" \"Nine,\" echoed Dowker; \"then in that case he must have stayed in town all night, as the last train to Shoreham is about half-past. I\u0027ll look into this business, but meantime I want to find out Desmond\u0027s little game.\" Flip had now finished, his meal and was waiting impatiently for instructions from his chief. \"Wot\u0027s h\u0027up, guv\u0027nor?\" he asked, his black beady eyes fixed on the detective. Dowker glanced at his watch. \"It\u0027s about two,\" he said, replacing it, \"and I want you to meet me at the Marble Arch about a quarter to three.\" \"Wot for?\" \"To follow a lady and gentleman and overhear what they say,\" said Dowker; \"I\u0027ll show you whom I mean. Don\u0027t lose a word of their conversation and then repeat it all to me.\" \"I\u0027m fly,\" said Flip with a wink, and then this curiously assorted pair departed, Dowker to his office for a few minutes, and Flip to wend his way to the rendezvous at the Marble Arch.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1865/53991.html","bookId":825,"book":{"id":825,"title":"The Piccadilly Puzzle","description":"简介： At two o\u0027clock in the morning during the month of August sounds of music could be heard proceeding from a brilliantly lighted house in Park Lane, where a ball was being given by the Countess of Kerstoke.
