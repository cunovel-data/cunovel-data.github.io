The publication of the whole story caused a great deal of excitement, and of course all the newspapers quoted the well-known proverb that \"Truth is stranger than fiction.\" Myles Desmond was released from prison, and became a kind of hero owing to the fortitude with which he had sustained his unpleasant position. Sir Rupert gave his consent to May Penfold\u0027s marriage with him, and it took place at St. George\u0027s, Hanover Square, with great splendour, and the happy pair departed to the Continent for their honeymoon. On their return Myles published a novel he had written, which was a great success, and being in an independent position owing to his wife\u0027s fortune he had the peculiar satisfaction of writing to please himself and not the public. Lord Calliston did not remain in London long, as the part he had played in the terrible drama was not by any means an enviable one; so as soon as Lena Sarschine, now Lady Calliston, recovered from her illness they went away to the South Seas in the Seamew, where among the gorgeous scenery of the islands, they soon forgot the one tragic episode of their lives. Sir Rupert did not marry again but left London for his place in the country, where he shut himself up like a hermit and steadily refused to see anyone. His faith in womankind was gone, and not having any heirs, a distant cousin is now eagerly waiting for his demise, as he is anxious to enjoy the Balscombe estates and the large income appertaining thereto. Flip was taken off the streets by Dowker and put to school, where his natural sharpness was wonderfully developed, and he is now looking forward to the time when Dowker intends to instruct him in the mysteries of the detective craft and make him his successor. As to Dowker, he was a good deal disappointed at the unlooked-for termination to the case, for had it not been for the accident of overhearing the conversation in the library, he would most certainly have done his best to hang Sir Rupert Balscombe. As it turned out that the baronet was innocent, he felt only too glad that he had been saved from the committal of such a terrible crime as condemning a guiltless man to an ignominious death, but to this day, he always refers to the Piccadilly Puzzle as the most extraordinary case that ever came under his experience.
