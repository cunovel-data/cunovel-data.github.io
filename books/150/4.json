{"id":4409,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"4:1 [hgb] 这 事 约 拿 大 大 不 悦 ， 且 甚 发 怒 。 [kjv] But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry. [bbe] But this seemed very wrong to Jonah, and he was angry. 4:2 [hgb] 就 祷 告 耶 和 华 说 ， 耶 和 华 阿 ， 我 在 本 国 的 时 候 ， 岂 不 是 这 样 说 吗 ？ 我 知 道 你 是 有 恩 典 ， 有 怜 悯 的 神 ， 不 轻 易 发 怒 ， 有 丰 盛 的 慈 爱 ， 并 且 后 悔 不 降 所 说 的 灾 ， 所 以 我 急 速 逃 往 他 施 去 。 [kjv] And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD, was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country? Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and repentest thee of the evil. [bbe] And he made prayer to the Lord and said, O Lord, is this not what I said when I was still in my country? This is why I took care to go in flight to Tarshish: for I was certain that you were a loving God, full of pity, slow to be angry and great in mercy, and ready to be turned from your purpose of evil. 4:3 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 现 在 求 你 取 我 的 命 吧 。 因 为 我 死 了 比 活 着 还 好 。 [kjv] Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me; for it is better for me to die than to live. [bbe] So now, O Lord, give ear to my prayer and take my life from me; for death is better for me than life. 4:4 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 你 这 样 发 怒 合 乎 理 吗 ？ [kjv] Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry? [bbe] And the Lord said, Have you any right to be angry? 4:5 [hgb] 于 是 约 拿 出 城 ， 坐 在 城 的 东 边 ， 在 那 里 为 自 己 搭 了 一 座 棚 ， 坐 在 棚 的 荫 下 ， 要 看 看 那 城 究 竟 如 何 。 [kjv] So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the shadow, till he might see what would become of the city. [bbe] Then Jonah went out of the town, and took his seat on the east side of the town and made himself a roof of branches and took his seat under its shade till he saw what would become of the town. 4:6 [hgb] 耶 和 华 神 安 排 一 棵 蓖 麻 ， 使 其 发 生 高 过 约 拿 ， 影 儿 遮 盖 他 的 头 ， 救 他 脱 离 苦 楚 。 约 拿 因 这 棵 蓖 麻 大 大 喜 乐 。 [kjv] And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd. [bbe] And the Lord God made a vine come up over Jonah to give him shade over his head. And Jonah was very glad because of the vine. 4:7 [hgb] 次 日 黎 明 ， 神 却 安 排 一 条 虫 子 咬 这 蓖 麻 ， 以 致 枯 槁 。 [kjv] But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd that it withered. [bbe] But early on the morning after, God made ready a worm for the destruction of the vine, and it became dry and dead. 4:8 [hgb] 日 头 出 来 的 时 候 ， 神 安 排 炎 热 的 东 风 。 日 头 曝 晒 约 拿 的 头 ， 使 他 发 昏 ， 他 就 为 自 己 求 死 ， 说 ， 我 死 了 比 活 着 还 好 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah, that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is better for me to die than to live. [bbe] Then when the sun came up, God sent a burning east wind: and so great was the heat of the sun on his head that Jonah was overcome, and, requesting death for himself, said, Death is better for me than life. 4:9 [hgb] 神 对 约 拿 说 ， 你 因 这 棵 蓖 麻 发 怒 合 乎 理 吗 ？ 他 说 ， 我 发 怒 以 至 于 死 都 合 乎 理 。 [kjv] And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death. [bbe] And the Lord said to Jonah, Have you any right to be angry about the vine? And he said, I have a right to be truly angry. 4:10 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 这 蓖 麻 不 是 你 栽 种 的 ， 也 不 是 你 培 养 的 。 一 夜 发 生 ， 一 夜 干 死 ， 你 尚 且 爱 惜 。 [kjv] Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which came up in a night, and perished in a night: [bbe] And the Lord said, You had pity on the vine, for which you did no work and for the growth of which you were not responsible; which came up in a night and came to an end in a night; 4:11 [hgb] 何 况 这 尼 尼 微 大 城 ， 其 中 不 能 分 辨 左 手 右 手 的 有 十 二 万 多 人 ， 并 有 许 多 牲 畜 。 我 岂 能 不 爱 惜 呢 ？ [kjv] And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand; and also much cattle? [bbe] And am I not to have mercy on Nineveh, that great town, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand persons without the power of judging between right and left, as well as much cattle?","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/142/2059.html","bookId":150,"book":{"id":150,"title":"约拿书 Jonah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 亚 米 太 的 儿 子 约 拿 ， 说 ， [kjv] Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, [bbe] And th...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/142","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:37 AM"}}
