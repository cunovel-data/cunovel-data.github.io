Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three days\u0027 journey. \n [bbe] So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh as the Lord had said. Now Nineveh was a very great town, three days\u0027 journey from end to end. \n 3:4 [hgb] 约 拿 进 城 走 了 一 日 ， 宣 告 说 ， 再 等 四 十 日 ， 尼 尼 微 必 倾 覆 了 。 \n [kjv] And Jonah began to enter into the city a day\u0027s journey, and he cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown. \n [bbe] And Jonah first of all went a day\u0027s journey into the town, and crying out said, In forty days destruction will overtake Nineveh. \n 3:5 [hgb] 尼 尼 微 人 信 服 神 ， 便 宣 告 禁 食 ， 从 最 大 的 到 至 小 的 ， 都 穿 麻 衣 （ 或 作 披 上 麻 布 ） 。 \n [kjv] So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them. \n [bbe] And the people of Nineveh had belief in God; and a time was fixed for going without food, and they put on haircloth, from the greatest to the least. \n 3:6 [hgb] 这 信 息 传 到 尼 尼 微 王 的 耳 中 ， 他 就 下 了 宝 座 ， 脱 下 朝 服 ， 披 上 麻 布 ， 坐 在 灰 中 。 \n [kjv] For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with sackcloth, and sat in ashes. \n [bbe] And the word came to the king of Nineveh, and he got up from his seat of authority, and took off his robe, and covering himself with haircloth, took his seat in the dust. \n 3:7 [hgb] 他 又 使 人 遍 告 尼 尼 微 通 城 ， 说 ， 王 和 大 臣 有 令 ， 人 不 可 尝 什 么 ， 牲 畜 ， 牛 羊 不 可 吃 草 ， 也 不 可 喝 水 。 \n [kjv] And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let them not feed, nor drink water: \n [bbe] And he had it given out in Nineveh, By the order of the king and his great men, no man or beast, herd or flock, is to have a taste of anything; let them have no food or water: \n 3:8 [hgb] 人 与 牲 畜 都 当 披 上 麻 布 ， 人 要 切 切 求 告 神 。 各 人 回 头 离 开 所 行 的 恶 道 ， 丢 弃 手 中 的 强 暴 。 \n [kjv] But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands. \n [bbe] And let man and beast be covered with haircloth, and let them make strong prayers to God: and let everyone be turned from his evil way and the violent acts of their hands. \n 3:9 [hgb] 或 者 神 转 意 后 悔 ， 不 发 烈 怒 ， 使 我 们 不 至 灭 亡 ， 也 未 可 知 。 \n [kjv] Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not? \n [bbe] Who may say that God will not be turned, changing his purpose and turning away from his burning wrath, so that destruction may not overtake us? \n 3:10 [hgb] 于 是 神 察 看 他 们 的 行 为 ， 见 他 们 离 开 恶 道 ， 他 就 后 悔 ， 不 把 所 说 的 灾 祸 降 与 他 们 了 。 \n [kjv] And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do unto them; and he did it not. \n [bbe] And God saw what they did, how they were turned from their evil way; and God\u0027s purpose was changed as to the evil which he said he would do to them, and he did it not. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/142/2058.html","bookId":150,"book":{"id":150,"title":"约拿书 Jonah","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 话 临 到 亚 米 太 的 儿 子 约 拿 ， 说 ， [kjv] Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai, saying, [bbe] And th...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/142","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:37 AM"}}
