{"id":39384,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. FRANK IS OBSTINATE.","content":"Mr. Craven had as yet gained nothing from his marriage. He was itching to get possession of his wife\u0027s property. Then his next step would be Frank\u0027s more considerable property. He was beginning to be low in pocket, and in the course of a month or so Mr. Green\u0027s note for six hundred dollars would fall due. He knew enough of that estimable gentleman to decide that it must be met, and, of course, out of his wife\u0027s money. \"My dear,\" he said one day, after breakfast, Frank being on his way to school, \"I believe I told you before our marriage that I had twenty thousand dollars invested in Lake Superior mines.\" \"Yes, Mr. Craven, I remember it.\" \"It is a very profitable investment,\" continued her husband. \"What per [70] cent. do you think it pays me?\" \"Ten per cent.,\" guessed Mrs. Craven. \"More than that. During the last year it has paid me twenty per cent.\" \"That is a great deal,\" said his wife, in surprise. \"To be sure it is, but not at all uncommon. You, I suppose, have not got more than seven or eight per cent. for your money?\" \"Only six per cent.\" Mr. Craven laughed softly, as if to say, \"What a simpleton you must be!\" \"I didn\u0027t know about these investments,\" said his wife. \"I don\u0027t know much about business.\" \"No, no. I suppose not. Few women do. Well, my dear, the best thing you can do is to empower me to invest your money for you in future.\" \"If you think it best,\" said Mrs. Craven. \"Certainly; it is my business to invest money. And, by the way, the income of Frank\u0027s property is paid to you, I believe.\" [71] \"Yes.\" \"He does not come into possession till twenty-one.\" \"That was his father\u0027s direction.\" \"And a very proper one. He intended that you should have the benefit of the income, which is, of course, a good deal more than Frank needs till he comes of age.\" \"I thought perhaps I ought to save up the surplus for Frank,\" said Mrs. Craven, hesitating. \"That is not necessary. Frank is amply provided for. He might be spoiled by too much money.\" \"I don\u0027t think so. Frank is an excellent boy,\" said his mother, warmly. \"So he is,\" said Mr. Craven. \"He has a noble, generous disposition, and for that very reason is more liable to be led astray.\" \"I hope he won\u0027t be led astray. I should feel wretched if I thought anything would befall him,\" said his mother, shuddering. \"We will look after him; we will see that he goes straight,\" said Mr. Craven, cheerfully. \"But I wanted to suggest, my dear, that it would [72] be proper that I should be appointed joint guardian with you.\" \"I am not sure whether Frank will like it,\" said his mother, who was aware that Frank, though scrupulously polite to his step-father, had no cordial liking or respect for him. \"As to that, my dear, I count upon you exerting your influence in the matter. If you recommend it he will yield.\" \"Don\u0027t you think it just as well as it is?\" said Mrs. Craven, hesitatingly. \"Of course, we shall go to you for counsel and advice in anything important.\" \"You don\u0027t seem to have confidence in me,\" said Mr. Craven, with an injured air. \"I hope you won\u0027t think that, Mr. Craven,\" said his wife, hastily. \"How can I help it? You know my interest in Frank, yet you are unwilling to have me associated in the guardianship.\" \"I didn\u0027t say I objected. I said Frank might.\" \"You are not willing to urge him to favor the measure.\" [73] \"You misunderstand me. Yes, I will,\" said yielding Mrs. Craven. \"Thank you, my dear,\" said Mr. Craven, with one of his most unctuous smiles. \"I was quite sure you would do me justice in the end. By the way, what disposition is made of Frank\u0027s property if he does not live to come of age?\" \"You—you don\u0027t think he is likely to be taken away?\" said Mrs. Craven, in distress. \"You are a goose,\" said her husband, laughing softly. \"Of course not. But then we are all mortal. Frank is strong, and will, I hope, live to smooth our dying pillows. But, of course, however improbable, the contingency is to be thought of.\" \"I believe the property comes to me in that case, but I am sure I should not live to enjoy it.\" \"My dear, don\u0027t make yourself miserable about nothing. Our boy is strong, and has every prospect of reaching old age. But it is best to understand clearly how matters stand. By the way, you need not say anything about the guardianship to him till I tell you.\" [74] Mrs. Craven not only complied with this request, but she surrendered to Mr. Craven the entire control of her money within an hour. She raised one or two timid objections, but these were overruled by her husband, and in the end she yielded. Mr. Craven was now in funds to pay the note held by Job Green, and this afforded him no little relief. A few evenings later, Frank was about to take his cap and go out, when Mr. Craven stopped him. \"Frank,\" he said, \"if you have no important engagement, your mother and I desire to speak to you on a matter of some consequence.\" \"I was only going to call on one of my friends,\" said Frank. \"I will defer that and hear what you have to say.\" \"Thank you,\" said Mr. Craven, smiling sweetly. \"I wished to speak to you on the subject of your property.\" \"Very well, sir.\" [75] \"Your mother is your guardian, she tells me.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"The responsibilities of a guardian are very great,\" proceeded Mr. Craven, leaning back upon his chair. \"Naturally there are some of them to which a woman cannot attend as well as a man.\" Frank began to understand what was coming, and, as it was not to his taste, he determined to declare himself at once. \"I couldn\u0027t have a better guardian than my mother,\" he said. \"Of course not. (I am afraid I shall find trouble with him, thought Mr. Craven.) Of course not. You couldn\u0027t possibly find any one as much interested in your welfare as your mother.\" \"Certainly not, sir.\" \"As your step-father, I naturally feel a strong interest in you, but I do not pretend to have the same interest as your mother.\" \"I never expected you would, sir,\" said Frank, \"and I don\u0027t want you to,\" he added, to himself. [76] \"But your mother is not used to business, and, as I said, the responsibilities of a guardian are great.\" \"What do you propose, sir?\" asked Frank, gazing at his step-father steadily. \"Do you recommend me to change guardians—to give up my mother?\" \"No, by no means. It is best that your mother should retain the guardianship.\" \"Then, sir, I don\u0027t quite understand what you mean.\" \"I mean to suggest that it would be well for another to be associated in the guardianship, who might relieve your mother of a part of her cares and responsibilities.\" \"I suppose you mean yourself, sir,\" said Frank. \"Yes—ahem!\" answered Mr. Craven, coughing softly, \"as your step-father, it would naturally occur to your mind that I am the most suitable person. Your mother thinks as I do.\" \"Do you want Mr. Craven to be guardian with you, mother?\" asked Frank, turning to his mother. [77] \"Mr. Craven thinks it best,\" said his mother, in a little embarrassment. \"He knows more about business matters than I do, and I have no doubt he is right.\" Frank understood that it was entirely Mr. Craven\u0027s idea, and something made it very repugnant to him. He did not want to be under the control of that man. Though he knew nothing to his disadvantage, he distrusted him. He had never ceased to regret that his mother married him, and he meant to have as little to do with him as politeness would permit. He answered, therefore: \"I hope, Mr. Craven, that you won\u0027t be offended if I say that I don\u0027t wish any change in the guardianship. If another were to be added, I suppose it would be proper that you should be the one, but I am content with my mother as guardian, and wish no other.\" \"I am afraid,\" said Mr. Craven, with a softness of tone which by no means accorded with his inward rage, \"that you are unmindful of the care the sole guardianship will impose on your mother.\" [78] \"Has it been much care for you, mother?\" asked Frank. \"Not yet,\" said Mrs. Craven, hesitating, \"but perhaps it may.\" \"I suppose Mr. Craven will always be ready to give you advice if you need it,\" said Frank, though the suggestion was not altogether to his taste, \"but I would rather have you only as my guardian.\" \"Well, let us drop the subject,\" said Mr. Craven, gayly. \"As you say, I shall always be ready to advise, if called upon. Now, my dear Frank, go to your engagement, I won\u0027t detain you any longer.\" But when Mr. Craven was alone, his countenance underwent a change. \"That boy is a thorn in my side,\" he muttered, with compressed lips. \"Sooner or later, he must be in my power, and his fortune under my control. Patience, Richard Craven! A dull-witted boy cannot defeat your plans!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2968/81710.html","bookId":376,"book":{"id":376,"title":"Frank Hunter\u0027s Peril","description":"简介： Frank Hunter was stretched on the lawn in a careless posture, but looked up quickly as the question fell upon his ear.
