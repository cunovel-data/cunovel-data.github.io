{"id":39381,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V. MR. CRAVEN\u0027S RETURN.","content":"Mr. Craven called the next day, as usual. Frank apologized again for Pompey\u0027s rude treatment of the evening previous, and, as far as he could, established friendly relations between the parties. Pompey, who had nothing vicious about him, and was only anxious to do his duty, looked meek and contrite, and Mr. Craven, to all appearance, had quite forgiven him. \"Good dog!\" he exclaimed, patting Pompey\u0027s head. \"Say no more about it, Frank,\" he said, in his usual soft voice; \"it was only an accident. I foresee that Pompey and I will be excellent friends in future.\" \"I hope your coat isn\u0027t much torn, sir.\" \"It can easily be repaired. It isn\u0027t worth mentioning. Is your mother at home.\" \"Yes, sir. Walk in.\" [41] \"He behaves very well about it,\" thought Frank. \"He may be a better man than I thought. I wish I could like him, as he is to be my step-father; but I think there are some persons it is impossible to like.\" So the time passed, and the wedding-day drew near. Frank did not consider it honorable to make any further objection to the marriage, though he often sighed as he thought of the stranger who was about to be introduced into their small circle. \"Mother will seem different to me when she is that man\u0027s wife,\" he said to himself. \"I shall love her as much, but she won\u0027t seem to belong to me as much as she did.\" In due time the wedding was celebrated. Mrs. Hunter wished it to be quiet, and Mr. Craven interposed no objection. Quiet or not, he felt that the substantial advantages of the union would be his all the same. Mrs. Hunter looked a little nervous during the ceremony, but Mr. Craven was smiling and suave as ever. When he kissed his wife, saluting her as Mrs. Craven, she shuddered a little, and with difficulty restrained her tears, for it reminded her of her first marriage, so different from [42] this, in which she wedded a man to whom she was devoted in heart and soul. The ceremony took place at eleven o\u0027clock, and the newly-wedded pair started on a tour as previously arranged. So for two weeks Frank and Katy O\u0027Grady were left alone in the house. Katy was a privileged character, having been in the family ever since Frank was a baby, and she had no hesitation in declaring her opinion of Mr. Craven. \"What possessed the mistress to marry such a mane specimen of a man, I can\u0027t tell,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t like him myself,\" said Frank; \"but we must remember that he\u0027s my mother\u0027s husband now, and make the best of him.\" \"And a mighty poor best it will be,\" said Katy. \"There you go again, Katy!\" \"I can\u0027t help it, shure. It vexes me intirely that my dear mistress should throw herself away on such a man.\" [43] \"What can\u0027t be cured must be endured, you know. You mustn\u0027t talk that way after Mr. Craven comes back.\" \"And what for will I not. Do you think I\u0027m afraid of him?\" asked Katy, defiantly. \"If he is a man, I could bate him in a square fight.\" \"I don\u0027t know but you could, Katy,\" said Frank, glancing at the muscular arms and powerful frame of the handmaiden; \"but I really hope you won\u0027t get into a fight,\" he added, smiling. \"It wouldn\u0027t look well, you know.\" \"Then he\u0027d better not interfare wid me,\" said Katy, shaking her head. \"You must remember that he will be master of the house, Katy.\" \"But he sha\u0027n\u0027t be master of Katy O\u0027Grady,\" said that lady, in a very decided tone. \"I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ll have much to do with him,\" said Frank. He sympathized with Katy more than he was willing to acknowledge, and wondered how far Mr. Craven would see fit to exercise the authority [44] of a step-father. He meant to treat him with the respect due to his mother\u0027s husband, but to regard him as a father was very repugnant to him. But he must be guided by circumstances, and he earnestly hoped that he would be able to live peacefully and harmoniously with Mr. Craven. Days passed, and at length Frank received a dispatch, announcing the return home. \"They will be home to-night, Katy,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll be glad to see your mother, shure,\" said Katy, \"but I wish that man wasn\u0027t comin\u0027 wid her.\" \"But we know he is, and we must treat him with respect.\" \"I don\u0027t feel no respect for him.\" \"You must not show your feelings, then, for my mother\u0027s sake.\" At five o\u0027clock the stage deposited Mr. and Mrs. Craven at the gate. Frank ran to his mother, and was folded in her embrace. Then he turned to Mr. Craven, who was standing by, with his usual smile, showing his white teeth. [45] \"I hope you have had a pleasant journey, sir,\" he said. \"Thank you, Frank, it has been very pleasant, but we are glad to get home, are we not, my dear?\" \"I am very glad,\" said Mrs. Craven, thankfully, and she spoke the truth; for though Mr. Craven had been all attention (he had not yet thought it prudent to show himself in his true colors), there being no tie of affection between them, she had grown inexpressibly weary of the soft voice and artificial smile of her new husband, and had yearned for the companionship of Frank, and even her faithful handmaiden, Katy O\u0027Grady, who was standing on the lawn to welcome her, and only waiting till Frank had finished his welcome. \"How do you do, Katy,\" said her mistress. \"I\u0027m well, mum, thankin\u0027 you for askin\u0027, and I\u0027m mighty glad to see you back.\" \"I hope you are glad to see me also, Katy,\" said Mr. Craven, but his soft voice and insinuating smile didn\u0027t melt the hostility of Miss O\u0027Grady. [46] \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve brought the mistress home safe,\" she said, with a low bow; \"we\u0027ve missed her from morning till night, sure; haven\u0027t we, Master Frank?\" \"I see she isn\u0027t my friend,\" thought Mr. Craven. \"She\u0027d better change her tune, or she won\u0027t stay long in my house.\" He had already begun to think of himself as the sole proprietor of the establishment, and his wife as an unimportant appendage. \"I hope you have some supper for us, Katy,\" said he, not choosing at present to betray his feelings, \"for I am quite sure Mrs. Craven and myself have a good appetite.\" \"Mrs. Craven!\" repeated Katy, in pretended ignorance. \"Oh, you mean the mistress, sure.\" \"Of course I do,\" said Mr. Craven, with a frown, for once betraying himself. \"Supper is all ready, ma\u0027am,\" said Katy, turning to Mrs. Craven. \"It\u0027ll be ready as soon as you\u0027ve took off your things.\" When they sat down to the table, Frank made a little mistake. He had always been accustomed to sit at the head of the table, opposite his [47] mother, and on the frequent occasions of Mr. Craven\u0027s taking a meal there during the engagement, the latter had taken the visitor\u0027s place at the side. So to-night, without thinking of the latter\u0027s new relations to him, Frank took his old place. Mr. Craven noticed it, and soft and compliant as he was, he determined to assert his position at once. \"I believe that is my place,\" he said, with an unpleasant smile. \"Oh, I beg pardon,\" said Frank, his face flushing. \"You forgot, I suppose,\" said Mr. Craven, still smiling. \"Yes, sir.\" \"You\u0027ll soon get used to the change,\" said his step-father, as he seated himself in the chair Frank had relinquished. Mrs. Craven looked a little uncomfortable. She began to realize that she had introduced a stranger into the family, and that this would interfere to a considerable extent with their old pleasant way of living. No one seemed inclined to talk except Mr. Craven. He seemed disposed to be sociable, and passed from one subject to another, regardless of the [48] brief answers he received. \"Well, Frank, and how have you got along since we were away?\" he asked. \"Very well, sir.\" \"And you haven\u0027t missed us then?\" \"I have missed my mother, and should have missed you,\" he added politely, \"if you had been accustomed to live here.\" \"And how is Pompey?\" asked Mr. Craven, again showing his teeth. \"The same as usual. I wonder he was not out on the lawn to receive you and my mother.\" \"I hope he wouldn\u0027t receive me in the same way as he did once,\" said Mr. Craven, again displaying his teeth. \"No danger, sir. He didn\u0027t know you then.\" \"That\u0027s true, but I will take care that he knows me now,\" said Mr. Craven, softly. \"I think he will remember you, sir; he is a good dog, and very peaceable unless he thinks there are improper persons about.\" \"I hope he didn\u0027t think me an improper person,\" said Mr. Craven. [49] \"No fear, sir.\" Frank wondered why Mr. Craven should devote so much time to Pompey, but he was destined to be enlightened very soon. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2968/81707.html","bookId":376,"book":{"id":376,"title":"Frank Hunter\u0027s Peril","description":"简介： Frank Hunter was stretched on the lawn in a careless posture, but looked up quickly as the question fell upon his ear.
