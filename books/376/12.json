{"id":39388,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII. TWO BOY FRIENDS.","content":"\"Going to Europe, Frank!\" repeated his friend, Ben Cameron, in unbounded astonishment. \"I can hardly believe it.\" \"I can hardly believe it myself; but it\u0027s true.\" \"How did it come about?\" \"Colonel Sharpley, Mr. Craven\u0027s friend, is going, and offered to take me.\" \"Didn\u0027t Mr. Craven object?\" \"No; why should he? He thought it was a good plan.\" \"And your mother?\" \"She was a little afraid at first that something might happen to me; but, as Colonel Sharpley and Mr. Craven were in favor of it, she yielded.\" [106] \"Well, Frank, all I can say is, that I wish I were in your shoes.\" \"I wish you were going with me, Ben. Wouldn\u0027t it be jolly?\" \"Unfortunately, Frank, I wasn\u0027t born with a silver spoon in my mouth, like you. You are the son of rich parents, while my father is a poor carpenter, working by the day.\" \"I like you as much as if you were worth half a million, Ben.\" \"I know you do, Frank; but that doesn\u0027t give me the half-million. I must postpone going to Europe till I have earned money enough with my own hands.\" \"Don\u0027t be too sure of that, Ben.\" \"What do you mean, Frank?\" \"I mean this, that when I am twenty-one I come into possession of about forty thousand dollars. Now, the interest on that is two thousand four hundred. I\u0027ll invite you to go abroad with me, and spend a year there. If the interest isn\u0027t enough to pay our expenses, I will take a few hundred dollars of the principal.\" \"That\u0027s a generous offer, Frank,\" said Ben; \"but you don\u0027t consider [107] that at that time I shall be a journeyman carpenter, very likely, while you will be a young gentleman, just graduated from college. You may not want such company then.\" \"My dear Ben,\" said Frank, laying his hand affectionately on the other\u0027s shoulder, \"if you think I\u0027m a snob or likely to become one, say so at once; but I hope you think better of me than to believe that I will ever be ashamed of my dearest friend, even if he is a journeyman carpenter. I should despise myself if I thought such a thing possible.\" \"Then I won\u0027t think so, Frank.\" \"That\u0027s right, Ben. We\u0027ll be friends for life, or, if we are not, it shall be your fault, not mine. But there\u0027s one favor I am going to ask of you.\" \"What is it?\" \"That while I am gone you will call round often and see mother. She will miss me a great deal, for I have always been with her, and it will be a pleasure to her to see you, whom she knows to be my dearest friend, and talk with you about me. Will you go?\" [108] \"Certainly I will, Frank, if you think she would like to have me.\" \"I know she would. You see, Ben, though Mr. Craven and my mother get along well enough, I am sure she doesn\u0027t love him. He may be a fair sort of man, and I am bound to say that I have no fault to find with him, but I don\u0027t think she finds a great deal of pleasure in his society. Of course, Ben, you won\u0027t repeat this?\" \"Certainly not.\" \"And you will call often?\" \"Yes, Frank.\" \"I will tell mother so. Then I shall leave home with a light heart. Just think of it, Ben—it\u0027s now the sixth of the month, and on the nineteenth I sail. I wish it were to-morrow.\" \"It will soon be here, Frank.\" \"Yes, I know it. I am afraid I can\u0027t fix my mind on my studies much for the next week or so. I shall be thinking of Europe all the time.\" Meanwhile, Mr. Craven and Colonel Sharpley, in the office of the former, were discussing the same subject. [109] \"So we have succeeded, Craven,\" said Sharpley, taking out a cigar and beginning to smoke. \"Yes, you managed it quite cleverly.\" \"Neither Mrs. Craven nor the boy will suspect that you are particularly interested in getting him out of the country.\" \"No,\" said Craven, complacently; \"I believe I scored a point in my favor with the boy by favoring the project. Had I opposed it, his mother would not have consented, and he knows it.\" \"Yes, that is well. It will avert suspicion hereafter. Now there is an important point to be considered. What funds are you going to place in my hands to start with?\" \"How much shall you need?\" \"Well, you must supply me with money at once to pay for tickets—say two hundred and fifty dollars, and a bill of exchange for a thousand dollars, to begin with. More can be sent afterward.\" \"I hope you won\u0027t be too extravagant, Sharpley,\" said Mr. Craven, a little uneasily. [110] \"Extravagant! Why, zounds, man, two persons can\u0027t travel for nothing. Besides, the money doesn\u0027t come out of your purse; it comes out of the boy\u0027s fortune.\" \"If I draw too much, his mother, who is his guardian, will be startled.\" \"Then draw part from her funds. You have the control of those.\" \"I don\u0027t know as I have a right to.\" \"Pooh, man, get over your ridiculous scruples. I know your real reason. You look upon her money as yours, and don\u0027t like to part with any of it. But just consider, if things turn out as we expect, you will shortly get possession of the boy\u0027s forty thousand dollars, and can then pay yourself. Don\u0027t you see it?\" \"Perhaps the boy may return in safety,\" suggested Craven. \"In that case our plans are all dished.\" \"Don\u0027t be afraid of that,\" said Sharpley, with wicked significance. \"I will take care of that.\" \"It shall be as you say, then,\" said Craven. \"You shall have two hundred dollars for the purchase of tickets and a bill of exchange for [111] a thousand.\" \"You may as well say three hundred, Craven, as there will be some extra preliminary expenses, and you had better give me the money now, as I am going up to the city this morning to procure tickets.\" \"Very well, three hundred let it be.\" \"And there\u0027s another point to be settled, a very important one, and we may as well settle it now.\" \"What is it?\" \"How much am I to receive in case our plans work well?\" \"How much?\" repeated Craven, hesitatingly. \"Yes, how much?\" \"Well, say two thousand dollars.\" \"Two thousand devils!\" exclaimed Sharpley, indignantly. \"Why, Craven, you must take me for a fool.\" Mr. Craven hastily disclaimed this imputation. \"You expect me to do your dirty work for any such paltry sum as that! No! I don\u0027t sell myself so cheap.\" [112] \"Two thousand dollars is a good deal of money.\" \"Not for such services as that, especially as it leaves you nineteen times as much. Craven, it won\u0027t do!\" \"Say five thousand dollars, then!\" said Craven, reluctantly. \"That\u0027s a little more like the figure, but it isn\u0027t enough.\" \"What will satisfy you, then?\" \"Ten thousand.\" \"Ten thousand!\" repeated Craven, in dismay. \"Yes, ten thousand,\" said Sharpley, firmly. \"Not a cent less.\" Mr. Craven expostulated, but his expostulations were all in vain. His companion felt that he had him in his power, and was not disposed to abate his demands. Finally the agreement was made. \"Shall it be in writing, Craven?\" asked Sharpley, jocosely. \"No, no.\" \"I didn\u0027t know but you might want to bind me. When does the train leave for New York?\" [113] \"In an hour.\" \"Then I\u0027ll trouble you to look up three hundred dollars for me, and I\u0027ll take it.\" By the ten o\u0027clock train Colonel Sharpley was a passenger. Mr. Craven saw him off, and then returned thoughtfully to his office. \"It\u0027s a bold plan,\" thus he soliloquized; \"but I think it will succeed. If it does, I shall no longer be dependent upon the will or caprice of my wife. I shall be my own master, and possessed of an abundant fortune. \"If only Sharpley and the boy could die together, it would be a great relief. While that man lives I shall not feel wholly safe. However, one at a time. Let the boy be got out of the way, and I will see what can be done for the other. The cards are in my favor, and if I play a crafty game, I shall win in the end.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2968/81714.html","bookId":376,"book":{"id":376,"title":"Frank Hunter\u0027s Peril","description":"简介： Frank Hunter was stretched on the lawn in a careless posture, but looked up quickly as the question fell upon his ear.
