{"id":39389,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. JONATHAN TARBOX, OF SQUASHBORO\u0027.","content":"A great steamer was plowing its way through the Atlantic waves. Fifteen hundred miles were traversed, and nearly the same remained to be crossed. The sea had been rough in consequence of a storm, and even now there was considerable motion. A few passengers were on deck, among them our young hero, who felt better in the open air than in the closer atmosphere below; besides, he admired the grandeur of the sea, spreading out on all sides of him, farther than his eyes could reach. He had got over his first sadness at parting with his mother, and he was now looking forward with the most eager anticipation to setting foot upon European soil. He shared a state-room with Sharpley, but the latter spent little time in the boy\u0027s company. He had discovered some congenial company among [115] the other passengers, and spent most of the time smoking with them or playing cards below. Frank did not miss him much, as he found plenty to engage his attention on board. As he stood looking out on the wild waste of waters, trying to see if anywhere he could discover another vessel, he was aroused by the salutation: \"I say, you boy!\" Looking around, he saw a tall, thin man, dressed in a blue swallow-tail coat with brass buttons, a high standing dickey, and pants three or four inches too short in the legs. He was an admirable specimen of the Yankee—as he is represented on the stage—an exceptional specimen, though some of our foreign friends may regard him as the rule. It was not the first time Frank had seen him. Two or three times he had appeared at the table; but he had been stricken with seasickness, and for the greater part of the voyage thus far had remained in his state-room. \"Good morning, sir,\" said Frank, politely. \"You have been seasick, haven\u0027t you?\" [116] \"Seasick! I guess I have,\" returned the other, energetically. \"I thought I was goin\u0027 to kick the bucket more\u0027n once.\" \"It is not a very agreeable feeling,\" said Frank. \"I guess not. If I\u0027d known what kind of a time I was a-goin\u0027 to have, I wouldn\u0027t have left Squashboro\u0027, you bet!\" \"Are you from Squashboro\u0027?\" asked Frank, amused. \"Yes, I\u0027m from Squashboro\u0027, State of Maine, and I wish I was there just now, I tell you.\" \"You won\u0027t feel so when you get on the other side,\" said Frank, consolingly. \"Well, may be not; but I tell you, boy, it feels kinder risky bein\u0027 out here on the mill-pond with nothin\u0027 but a plank between you and drownin\u0027. I guess I wouldn\u0027t make a very good sailor.\" \"Are you going to travel much?\" asked Frank. \"Wal, you see, I go mostly on business. My name\u0027s Jonathan Tarbox. My father\u0027s name is Elnathan Tarbox. He\u0027s got a nice farm in Squashboro\u0027, [117] next to old Deacon Perkins\u0027. Was you ever in Squashboro\u0027?\" \"No; I think not.\" \"It\u0027s a thrivin\u0027 place, is Squashboro\u0027. Wal, now, I guess you are wonderin\u0027 what sets me out to go to Europe, ain\u0027t you?\" \"I suppose you want to see the country, Mr. Tarbox.\" \"Ef that was all, you wouldn\u0027t catch me goin\u0027 over and spendin\u0027 a heap of money, all for nothin\u0027. That ain\u0027t business.\" \"Then I suppose you go on business?\" \"I guess I do. You see I\u0027ve invented a new plow, that, I guess, is goin\u0027 to take the shine off of any other that\u0027s in use, and it kinder struck me that ef I should take it to the Paris Exhibition, I might, may be, make somethin\u0027 out of it. I\u0027ve heerd that they\u0027re a good deal behind in farm tools in the old European countries, and I guess I\u0027ll open their eyes a little with my plow.\" \"I hope you\u0027ll succeed, Mr. Tarbox,\" said Frank, politely. \"I guess I shall. You see, I\u0027ve risked considerable money onto it—that is, in travelin\u0027 expenses and such like. You see, my Uncle Abner—he [118] wasn\u0027t my real uncle, that is, by blood, but he was the husband of my Aunt Matilda, my mother\u0027s oldest sister—didn\u0027t have no children of his own, so he left me two thousand dollars in his will.\" Mr. Tarbox paused in order to see what effect the mention of this great inheritance would have upon his auditor. \"Indeed you were lucky, Mr. Tarbox,\" said Frank. \"I guess I felt tickled when I heard of it. I jist kicked like a two-year-old colt. Wal, now, dad wanted me to buy a thirty-acre farm that was for sale about half a mile from his\u0027n, but I wouldn\u0027t. I\u0027d about fetched my plow out right, and I wa\u0027n\u0027t goin\u0027 to settle down on no two-thousand-dollar farm. Catch me! No; I heerd of this Paris Exhibition, and I vowed I\u0027d come out here and see what could be did. So here I am. I ain\u0027t sorry I cum, though I was about sick enough to die. Thought I should a-turned inside out one night when the vessel was goin\u0027 every which way.\" [119] \"I was sick myself that night,\" said Frank. Mr. Tarbox having now communicated all his own business, naturally felt a degree of curiosity about that of his young companion. \"Are you goin\u0027 to the Paris Exhibition?\" he asked. \"I suppose so. It depends upon Colonel Sharpley.\" \"The man you\u0027re travelin\u0027 with? Yes; I saw him at the table—tall man, black hair, and slim, ain\u0027t he?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"So he\u0027s a colonel, is he?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did he fight in any of our wars?\" \"No, he\u0027s an Englishman.\" \"Oh!\" exclaimed Mr. Tarbox, with a slight contempt in his voice. \"He wouldn\u0027t be no match for an American officer.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Frank. \"Wal, I do—the Yankees always could whip any other nation, not but the colonel seems a respectable man, though he\u0027s a foreigner.\" [120] \"It is we who will be foreigners when we get to England,\" said Frank. This aroused the controversial spirit of Mr. Tarbox. \"Do you mean to say that you and me will turn to furriners?\" he asked, indignantly. \"We shall be foreigners in England.\" \"No, we won\u0027t,\" said Jonathan, energetically. \"At any rate, I won\u0027t. I shall always be a free-born American citizen, and a free-born American citizen can\u0027t be a furriner.\" \"Not in America, Mr. Tarbox, but in England, I am saying.\" \"A free-born American citizen ain\u0027t a furriner anywhere,\" said Mr. Tarbox, emphatically. Frank was amused, but felt it wise to discontinue the discussion. \"Are you goin\u0027 to Europe on business?\" inquired the other. \"No, only for pleasure.\" \"Sho! I guess you must have a considerable pile of money!\" suggested Mr. Tarbox, inquiringly. [121] \"I have a little money,\" said Frank, modestly. \"Left you?\" \"Yes, by my father.\" \"Wal, so you\u0027re in luck, too. Is the colonel related to you?\" \"No. He is a friend of my step-father.\" \"Sho! So your mother married again. How long are you going to stay on the other side?\" \"Only three or four months, I think.\" \"Do you know how much they ask for board in Paris?\" asked Jonathan, with considerable interest. \"No, Mr. Tarbox, I have no idea. I suppose it\u0027s according to what kind of rooms and board you take.\" \"Wal, you see, Mr.—what did you say your name was?\" \"Hunter.\" \"I once knowed a Hunter—I think he was took up for stealing.\" \"I don\u0027t think he was any relation of mine, Mr. Tarbox.\" \"Likely not. What was I a-goin\u0027 to say? Oh, Mr. Hunter, I ain\u0027t very [122] particular about my fodder. I don\u0027t mind havin\u0027 baked beans half the time—pork and beans—and you know them are cheap.\" \"So I\u0027ve heard.\" \"And as to a room, I don\u0027t mind it\u0027s bein\u0027 fixed up with fiddle-de-dee work and sich. Ef it\u0027s only comfortable—that\u0027ll suit me.\" \"Then I think you\u0027ll be able to get along cheap, Mr. Tarbox.\" \"That\u0027s what I calc\u0027late. Likely I\u0027ll see you over there. What\u0027s that bell for?\" \"Lunch.\" \"Let\u0027s go down. Fact is, I\u0027ve been so tarnal sea-sick I\u0027m empty as a well-bucket dried in the sun. I guess I can eat to-day.\" They went down to the saloon, and Mr. Tarbox\u0027s prophecy was verified. He shoveled in the food with great energy, and did considerable toward making up for past deficiencies. Frank looked on amused. He was rather inclined to like his countryman, though he acknowledged him to be very deficient in polish and refinements. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2968/81715.html","bookId":376,"book":{"id":376,"title":"Frank Hunter\u0027s Peril","description":"简介： Frank Hunter was stretched on the lawn in a careless posture, but looked up quickly as the question fell upon his ear.
