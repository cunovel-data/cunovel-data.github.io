{"id":23555,"no":5,"title":"LITTLE CHARLIE.","content":"A violet grew by the river-side, And gladdened all hearts with its bloom; While over the fields, on the scented air, It breathed a rich perfume. But the clouds grew dark in the angry sky, And its portals were opened wide; And the heavy rain beat down the flower That grew by the river-side. Not far away, in a pleasant home, There lived a little boy, Whose cheerful face and childish grace Filled every heart with joy. He wandered one day to the river’s verge, With no one near to save; And the heart that we loved with a boundless love Was stilled in the restless wave. [54] The sky grew dark to our tearful eyes, And we bade farewell to joy; For our hearts were bound by a sorrowful tie To the grave of the little boy. The birds still sing in the leafy tree That shadows the open door: We heed them not; for we think of the voice That we shall hear no more. We think of him at eventide, And gaze on his vacant chair With a longing heart, that will scarce believe That Charlie is not there. We seem to hear his ringing laugh, And his bounding step at the door; But, alas! there comes the sorrowful thought,— We shall never hear them more! We shall walk sometimes to his little grave, In the pleasant summer hours; We will speak his name in a softened voice, And cover his grave with flowers; We will think of him in his heavenly home,— His heavenly home so fair; And we will trust with a hopeful trust That we shall meet him there.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2956/81293.html","bookId":433,"book":{"id":433,"title":"Bertha\u0027s Christmas Vision: An Autumn Sheaf","description":"简介： Of all the houses which Martin Kendrick owned, he used the oldest and meanest for his own habitation.
