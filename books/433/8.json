We have planted it deep in the yielding soil, Hard by the house of prayer; And the cool air plays through its leafy top, As it stands in silence there. It is young like ourselves; but, day by day, The dews of heaven will fall,— And the gladsome rays of the summer sun, That shines for each and all; And, under their gentle ministry, It will grow both stout and tall. Then will the roots of the stately tree Have spread both far and wide; And perchance its branches will overtop The church that stands beside; And safe amid its clustering leaves Will summer birds abide. [76] And those who, full of youthful life, About the sapling played, With sober mien and whitened locks Will stand beneath its shade, And ponder with a thoughtful brow On the changes Time has made. The years will roll, with a steady course, To meet Time’s infinite sea; And the silent waves, in their fearful sweep, Will ingulf both you and me; But still, like a beacon that tells of the past, Will stand our first elm-tree. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2956/81296.html","bookId":433,"book":{"id":433,"title":"Bertha\u0027s Christmas Vision: An Autumn Sheaf","description":"简介： Of all the houses which Martin Kendrick owned, he used the oldest and meanest for his own habitation.
