I know not If a phantom it may be; But yet, in my inmost heart, I feel That it lives, and lives for me;— “For, when clouds and darkness are round me, And my heart is heavy with care, I steal me away from the noisy crowd, To dwell in my castle fair. “There are servants to do my bidding; There are servants to heed my call; And I, with a master’s air of pride, May pace through the vaulted hall. “And I envy not the monarchs With cities under their sway; For am I not, in my own right, A monarch as proud as they? [37] “What matter, then, if to others My castle a phantom may be, Since I feel, in the depth of my own heart, That it is not so to me?” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2956/81291.html","bookId":433,"book":{"id":433,"title":"Bertha\u0027s Christmas Vision: An Autumn Sheaf","description":"简介： Of all the houses which Martin Kendrick owned, he used the oldest and meanest for his own habitation.
