And our earth-worn hearts were gladdened As we gazed into her eyes,— Liquid mirrors, freshly tinted With the hues of paradise. Through the long days of the summer, Bound as with a magic spell, Warm and warmer in our bosoms Grew the love of Gabrielle. [95] But, alas! the summer faded, And the autumn leaves grew sear, And our cherished household blossom Faded with the fading year. In the quiet grave we laid her; There, we trust, she sleepeth well; And we hope, when life is over, We shall meet our Gabrielle.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2956/81298.html","bookId":433,"book":{"id":433,"title":"Bertha\u0027s Christmas Vision: An Autumn Sheaf","description":"简介： Of all the houses which Martin Kendrick owned, he used the oldest and meanest for his own habitation.
