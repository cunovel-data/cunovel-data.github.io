{"id":23592,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER TWENTY Gabriel at the Big Poplar","content":"Late one afternoon, at a date when the tension between the two races was at its worst, Gabriel chanced to be sitting under the great poplar which was for years, and no doubt is yet, one of the natural curiosities of Shady Dale, on account of its size and height. He had been reading, but the light had grown dim as the sun dipped behind the hills, and he now sat with his eyes closed. His seat at the foot of the tree was not far from the public highway, though that fact did not add to its attractions from Gabriel\u0027s point of view. He preferred the seat for sentimental reasons. He had played there when a little lad, and likewise Nan had played there; and they had both played there together. The old poplar was hollow, and on one side the bark and a part of the trunk had sloughed away. Here Gabriel and Nan had played housekeeping, many and many a day before the girl had grown tired of her dolls. The hollow formed a comfortable playhouse, and the youngsters, in addition to housekeeping, had enjoyed little make-believe parties and picnics there. As Gabriel sat leaning against the old poplar, his back to the road and his eyes closed, he heard the sound of men\u0027s voices. The conversation was evidently between country folk who had been spending a part of the day in town. Turning his head, Gabriel saw that there were three persons, one riding and two walking. Directly opposite the tree where Gabriel sat, they met an acquaintance who was apparently making a belated visit to town. \"Hello, boys!\" said the belated one by way of salutation. \"I \u0027low\u0027d I\u0027d find you in town, an\u0027 have company on my way home.\" \"What\u0027s the matter, Sam?\" asked one of the others. \"This ain\u0027t no time of day to be gwine away from home.\" \"Well, I\u0027m jest obliged to git some ammunition,\" replied Sam. \"I\u0027ve been off to mill mighty nigh all day, an\u0027 this evenin\u0027, about four o\u0027clock, whilst my wife was out in the yard, a big buck nigger stopped at the gate, an\u0027 looked at her. She took no notice of him one way or another, an\u0027 presently, he ups an\u0027 says, \u0027Hello, Sissy! can\u0027t you tell a feller howdy?\u0027\" \"He did?\" cried the others. Gabriel could hear their gasps of astonishment and indignation from where he sat. \"He said them very words,\" replied Sam; \"\u0027Hello, Sissy! can\u0027t you tell a feller howdy?\u0027\" \"Did you leave anybody at home?\" inquired one of the others. \"You bet your sweet life!\" replied Sam in the slang of the day. \"Johnny Bivins is there, an\u0027 he ain\u0027t no slouch, Johnny ain\u0027t. I says to Molly, says I, \u0027Johnny will camp here till I can run to town, an\u0027 git me some powder an\u0027 buckshot.\u0027\" \"We have some,\" one of the others suggested. \"Better let \u0027im go on an\u0027 git it,\" said another; \"we can\u0027t have too much in our neck of the woods when things look like they do now. We\u0027ll wait for you, Sam, if you\u0027ll hurry up.\" \"Good as wheat!\" responded Sam, who went rapidly toward town. \"I tell you what, boys, we didn\u0027t make up our minds about this business a single minute too soon,\" remarked one of the three who were waiting for the return of their neighbour. \"Somethin\u0027s got to be done, an\u0027 the sooner it\u0027s done, the sooner it\u0027ll be over with.\" \"You\u0027re talkin\u0027 now with both hands and tongue!\" declared one of the others, in a tone of admiration. \"You\u0027ll see,\" remarked the one who had proposed to wait, \"that Sam is jest as ripe as we are. We know what we know, an\u0027 Sam knows what he knows. I don\u0027t know as I blame the niggers much. Look at it from their side of the fence. They see these d—d white hellians goin\u0027 roun\u0027, snortin\u0027 an\u0027 preachin\u0027 ag\u0027in the whites, an\u0027 they see us settin\u0027 down, hands folded and eyes shet, and they jest natchally think we\u0027re whipped and cowed. Can you blame \u0027em? I hate \u0027em all right enough, but I don\u0027t blame \u0027em.\" Gabriel knew that the man who was speaking was George Rivers, a small farmer living a short distance in the country. His companions were Tom Alford and Britt Hanson, and the man who had gone to town for the ammunition was Sam Hathaway. \"Are you right certain an\u0027 shore that this man Hotchkiss is stayin\u0027 wi\u0027 Mahlon Butts?\" George Rivers inquired. \"He lopes out from there every mornin\u0027,\" replied Tom Alford. \"Mahlon allers was the biggest skunk in the woods,\" remarked Hanson. \"He\u0027s runnin\u0027 for ordinary. I happened to hear him talkin\u0027 to a lot of niggers t\u0027other day, and I went up and cussed him out. I wanted the niggers to see how chicken-hearted he is. Well, sirs, he never turned a feather. I never seed a more lamblike man in my life. I started to spit in his face, and then I happened to think about his wife. Yes, sirs, it seemed to me for about the space of a second or two that I was lookin\u0027 right spang in Becky\u0027s big eyes, an\u0027 I couldn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 said a word or done a thing to save my life. I jest whirled in my tracks and went on about my business. You-all know Becky Butts—well, there\u0027s a woman that comes mighty nigh bein\u0027 a saint. Why she married sech a rapscallion as Mahlon, I\u0027ll never tell you, an\u0027 I don\u0027t believe she knows herself. But she\u0027s all that\u0027s saved Mahlon.\" \"That\u0027s the Lord\u0027s truth,\" responded Tom Alford. \"Why, when he first j\u0027ined the stinkin\u0027 radicals,\" continued Britt Hanson, \"a passel of the boys, me among \u0027em, laid off to pay him a party call, an\u0027 string him up. Well, the very day we\u0027d fixed on, here comes Becky over to my house; an\u0027 she fetched the baby, too. I knowed, time I laid eyes on her, that she had done got wind of what we was up to. Says she to me, \u0027Britt, I hear it whispered around that you are fixin\u0027 up to do me next to the worst harm a man can do to a woman.\u0027 \u0027Why, Becky,\u0027 says I, \u0027I wouldn\u0027t harm you for the world, and I wouldn\u0027t let anybody else do it.\u0027 \u0027Oh, yes, you would, Britt,\u0027 says she. She laughed as she said it, but when I looked in her big eyes, I could see trouble and pain in \u0027em. I says to her, says I, \u0027What put that idee in your head, Becky?\u0027 And says she, \u0027No matter how it got there, Britt, so long as it\u0027s there. You\u0027re fixin\u0027 up to hurt me an\u0027 my baby.\u0027 \"Well, sirs, you can see where she had me. I says, says I, \u0027Becky, what\u0027s to hender you from takin\u0027 supper here to-night?\u0027 This kinder took her by surprise. She says, \u0027I\u0027d like it the best in the world, Britt; but don\u0027t you think I\u0027d better be at home—to-night?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 says I, \u0027a passel of the boys\u0027ll be here d\u0027reckly after supper, and I reckon maybe they\u0027d like to see you. You know yourself that they\u0027re all mighty fond of you, Becky,\u0027 says I. She sorter studied awhile, an\u0027 then she says, \u0027I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do, Britt—I\u0027ll come over after supper an\u0027 set awhile.\u0027 \u0027You ain\u0027t afeard to come?\u0027 says I. \u0027No, Britt,\u0027 says she; \u0027I ain\u0027t afeard of nothin\u0027 in this world except my friends.\u0027 She was laughin\u0027, but they ain\u0027t much diff\u0027ence betwixt that kind of laughin\u0027 an\u0027 cryin\u0027. \"About that time, mother come in. Says she, \u0027An\u0027 be shore an\u0027 fetch the baby, Becky.\u0027 The minnit mother said that, I know\u0027d that she was the one that told Becky what we had laid off to do. You-all know what happened after that.\" \"We do that away,\" said George Rivers. \"When I walked in on you, and seen Becky an\u0027 the baby, I know\u0027d purty well that the jig was up, but I thought I\u0027d set it out and see what\u0027d happen.\" \"I never seen a baby do like that\u0027n done that night,\" remarked Tom Alford. \"It laughed an\u0027 it crowed, an\u0027 helt out its han\u0027s to go to ever\u0027 blessed feller in the crowd; an\u0027 Becky looked like she was the happiest creetur in the world. I was the fust feller to cave, an\u0027 I didn\u0027t feel a bit sheepish about it, neither. I rose, I did, an\u0027 says, \u0027Well, boys, it\u0027s about my bedtime, an\u0027 I reckon I\u0027ll toddle along,\u0027 an\u0027 so I handed the baby to the next feller, an\u0027 mosied off home.\" \"You did,\" said Britt Hanson, \"an\u0027 by the time the boys got through passin\u0027 the baby to the next feller, there wan\u0027t any feller left but me. An\u0027 then the funniest thing happened that you ever seed. You know how Becky was gwine on, laughin\u0027 an\u0027 talkin\u0027. Well, the last man hadn\u0027t hardly shet the door behind him, when Becky flopped down and put her head in mother\u0027s lap, and cried like a baby. I\u0027m mighty glad I ain\u0027t married,\" Britt Hanson went on. \"There ain\u0027t a man in the world that knows a woman\u0027s mind. Why, Becky was runnin\u0027 on and laughin\u0027 jest like a gal at picnic up to the minnit the last man slammed the door, and then, down she went and began to boohoo. Now, what do you think of that?\" \"I know one thing,\" remarked George Rivers—\"the meaner a man is, the quicker he gits the pick of the flock. The biggest fool in the world allers gits the best or the purtiest gal.\" Then there was a pause, as if the men were listening. \"Well,\" said Tom Alford, after awhile, \"we ain\u0027t after the gals now. That Hotchkiss feller goes out to Mahlon\u0027s by fust one road and then the other. You know where Ike Varner lives; well, Ike\u0027s wife is a mighty good-lookin\u0027 yaller gal, an\u0027 when Hotchkiss knows that Ike ain\u0027t at home, he goes by that road. I got all that from a nigger that works for me. If Ike ain\u0027t at home, he goes in for a drink of water, an\u0027 then he tells the yaller gal how to convert Ike into bein\u0027 a radical—Ike, you know, don\u0027t flock with that crowd. That\u0027s what the gal tells my nigger. Well, I put a flea in Ike\u0027s ear t\u0027other day, an\u0027 night before last, Ike comes to me to borry my pistol. You know that short, single-barrel shebang? Well, I loant it to him on the express understandin\u0027 that he wasn\u0027t to shoot any spring doves nor wild pea-fowls.\" The men laughed, and then sat or stood silent, each occupied with his own reflections, until Sam Hathaway returned. Whereupon, they moved on, one of them singing, in a surprisingly sweet tenor, the ballad of \"Nelly Gray.\" It was now dark, and ordinarily, Gabriel would have gone to supper. But, instead of doing that, he went on toward town, and met Hotchkiss and Boring on the outskirts. They were engaged in a close discussion when Gabriel met them. It would have been a great deal better for him and his friends if he had passed on without a word; but Gabriel was Gabriel, and he was compelled to act according to Gabriel\u0027s nature. So, without hesitation, he walked up to the two men. \"Is this Mr. Hotchkiss?\" he inquired. \"That is my name,\" replied Hotchkiss in his smoothest tone. \"Are you going out to Butts\u0027s to-night?\" \"Now, that is a queer question,\" remarked Hotchkiss, after a pause—\"a very queer question. What is your name?\" \"Tolliver—Gabriel Tolliver.\" \"Gabriel Tolliver—h\u0027m—yes. Well, Mr. Tolliver, why are you so desirous of knowing whether I go to Butts\u0027s to-night?\" \"Honestly,\" replied Gabriel, a little nettled at the man\u0027s airs, \"I don\u0027t want to know at all. I simply wanted to advise you not to go there to-night.\" \"Oh, you wanted to advise me not to go. Now, then, let\u0027s go a little further into the matter. Why do you want to advise me?\" Hotchkiss was a man who was not only ripe for a discussion at all times, and upon any subject, but made it a point to emphasise all the most trifling details. \"Have you any special interest in my welfare?\" \"I think not,\" replied Gabriel, bluntly. \"I simply wanted to drop you a hint. You can take it or not, just as you choose.\" With that, he turned on his heel, and went home to supper, little dreaming that his kindness of heart, and his sincere efforts to do a stranger a favour would involve him in a tangled web of circumstances, from which he would find it almost impossible to escape. Gabriel heard Hotchkiss laugh, but he did not hear the remark that followed. \"Why, even the children and the young men think I am a coward. They have the idea that courage exists nowhere but among themselves. It is the most peculiar mental delusion I ever heard, and it persists in the face of facts. The probability is that the young man who has just delivered this awful warning has laid a wager with some of his companions that he can fill me full of fright and prevent my going to Butts\u0027s.\" \"Now, I don\u0027t think that,\" replied Boring, or Bridalbin. \"I know these people to the core. I had their ideas and thought their thoughts until I found that sentiment doesn\u0027t pay. That young man has probably heard some threat made against you, and he thinks he is doing the chivalrous thing to give you a warning. Chivalry! Why, I reckon that word has done more harm to this section, first and last, than the war itself.\" \"Or, more probable still,\" suggested Hotchkiss, his voice as smooth and as flexible as a snake, \"he was simply trying to find out whether I propose to go to Butts\u0027s to-night. If I had some one to keep an eye on him, we might be able to procure some important information, disclosing a conspiracy against the officers of the Government. A few arrests in this neighbourhood might have a wholesome and subduing effect.\" \"Don\u0027t you believe it,\" said Bridalbin. \"I know these people a great deal better than you do.\" \"I know them a great deal better than I care to,\" remarked Hotchkiss drily. \"I have not a doubt that this young Tolliver was one of that marauding band of conspirators that surrounded the church recently, and endeavoured to intimidate our coloured fellow-citizens. Nor do I doubt that these same conspirators will make an effort to frighten me. I have no doubt that they will make a strong effort to run me away. But they can\u0027t do it, my friend. I feel that I have a mission here, and here I propose to stay until there is no work for me to do.\" \"Well, I can keep an eye on Tolliver if you think it best,\" Bridalbin suggested somewhat doubtfully. \"I know where he lives.\" \"Do that, Boring,\" exclaimed Hotchkiss with grateful enthusiasm. \"Come to the lodge about nine or half-past, and report.\" The \"lodge\" was the new name for the old school-house, and in that direction Hotchkiss turned his steps. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77507.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
