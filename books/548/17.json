{"id":23588,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER SIXTEEN Silas Tomlin Finds Trouble","content":"When Silas Tomlin reached home, he found his son reading a book. No word of salutation passed between them; Paul simply changed his position in the chair, and Silas grunted. They had no confidences, and they seemed to have nothing in common. As a matter of fact, however, Silas was very fond of this son, proud of his appearance—the lad was as neat as a pin, and fairly well-favoured,—and proud of his love for books. Unhappily, Silas was never able to show his affection and his fair-haired son never knew to his dying day how large a place he occupied in his father\u0027s heart. Miserly Silas was with money, but his love for his son was boundless. It destroyed or excluded every other sentiment or emotion that was in conflict with it. His miserliness was for his son\u0027s sake, and he never put away a dollar without a feeling of exultation; he rejoiced in the fact that it would enable his son to live more comfortably than his father had cared to live. Silas loved money, not for its own sake, but for the sake of his son. Mrs. Absalom would have laughed at such a statement. The social structure of the Southern people, and the habits and traditions based thereon, were of such a character that a great majority could not be brought to believe that it was possible for parsimony to exist side by side with any of the finer feelings. All the conditions and circumstances, the ability to command leisure, the very climate itself, promoted hospitality, generosity, open-handedness, and that fine spirit of lavishness that seeks at any cost to give pleasure to others. Popular opinion, therefore, looked with a cold and suspicious eye on all manifestations of selfishness. But Silas Tomlin\u0027s parsimony, his stinginess, had no selfish basis. He was saving not for himself, but for his son, in whom all his affections and all his ambitions were centered. He had reared Paul tenderly without displaying any tenderness, and if the son had speculated at all in regard to the various liberties he had been allowed, or the indulgent methods that had been employed in his bringing up, he would have traced them to the carelessness and indifference of his father, rather than to the ardent affection that burned unseen and unmarked in Silas\u0027s bosom. He had never, by word or act, intentionally wounded the feelings of his son; he had never thrown himself in the path of Paul\u0027s wishes. There was a feeling in Shady Dale that Silas was permitting his son to go to the dogs; whereas, as a matter of fact, no detective was ever more alert. Without seeming to do so, he had kept an eye on all Paul\u0027s comings and goings. When the lad\u0027s desires were reasonable, they were promptly gratified; when they were unreasonable, their gratification was postponed until they were forgotten. Books Paul had in abundance. Half of the large library of Meredith Tomlin had fallen to Silas, and the other half to Pulaski Tomlin, and the lad had free access to all. Paul was very fond of his Uncle Pulaski and his Aunt Fanny, and he was far more familiar with these two than he was with his father. His association with his uncle and aunt was in the nature of a liberal education. It was Pulaski Tomlin who really formed Paul\u0027s character, who gathered together all the elements of good that are native to the mind of a sensitive lad, and moulded them until they were strong enough to outweigh and overwhelm the impulses of evil that are also native to the growing mind. Thus it fell out that Paul was a young man to be admired and loved by all who find modest merit pleasing. When his father arrived at home on that particular evening, as has been noted, Paul was reading a book. He changed his position, but said nothing. After awhile, however, he felt something was wrong. His father, instead of seating himself at the table, and consulting his note-book, walked up and down the floor. \"What is wrong? Are you ill?\" Paul asked after awhile. \"No, son; I am as well in body as ever I was; but I\u0027m greatly troubled. I wish to heaven I could go back to the beginning, and tell you all about it; but I can\u0027t—I just can\u0027t.\" Paul also had his troubles, and he regarded his father gloomily enough. \"Why can\u0027t you tell me?\" he asked, somewhat impatiently. \"But I needn\u0027t ask you that; you never tell me anything. I heard something to-day that made me ashamed.\" \"Ashamed, Paul?\" gasped his father. \"Yes—ashamed. And if it is true, I am going away from here and never show my face again.\" Silas fell, rather than leaned, against the mantel-piece, his face ghastly white. He tried to say, \"What did you hear, Paul?\" His lips moved, but no sound issued from his throat. \"Two or three persons told me to-day,\" Paul went on, \"that they had heard of your intention to join the radicals, and run for the legislature. I told each and every one of them that it was an infernal lie; but I don\u0027t know whether it is a lie or not. If it isn\u0027t I\u0027ll leave here.\" Silas Tomlin\u0027s heart had been in his throat, as the saying is, but he gulped it down again and smiled faintly. If this was all Paul had heard, well and good. Compared with some other things, it was a mere matter of moonshine. Paul took up his book again, but he turned the leaves rapidly, and it was plain that he was impatiently waiting for further information. At last Silas spoke: \"All the truth in that report, Paul, is this—It has been suggested to me that it would be better for the whites here if some one who sympathises with their plans, and understands their interests, should pretend to become a Republican, and make the race for the legislature. This is what some of our best men think.\" \"What do you mean by our best men, father?\" \"Why, I don\u0027t know that I am at liberty to mention names even to you, Paul,\" said Silas, who had no notion of being driven into a corner. \"And then, on the other hand, the white Republicans are not as fond of the negroes as they pretend to be. And if they can\u0027t get some native-born white man to run, who do you reckon they\u0027ll have to put up as a candidate? Why, old Jerry, Pulaski\u0027s man of all work.\" \"Well, what of it?\" Paul asked with rising indignation. \"Jerry is a great deal better than any white man who puts himself on an equality with him.\" \"Have you met Mr. Hotchkiss?\" asked Silas. \"He seems to be a very clever man.\" \"No, I haven\u0027t met him and I don\u0027t want to meet him.\" Paul rose from his seat, and stood facing his father. He was a likely-looking young man, tall and slim, but broad-shouldered. He had the delicate pink complexion that belongs to fair-haired persons. \"This is a question, father, that can\u0027t be discussed between us. You beat about the bush in such a way as to compel me to believe the reports I have heard are true. Well, you can do as you like; I\u0027ll not presume to dictate to you. You may disgrace yourself, but you sha\u0027n\u0027t disgrace me.\" With that, the high-strung young fellow seized his hat, and flung out of the house, carrying his book with him. He shut the door after him with a bang, as he went out, demonstrating that he was full of the heroic indignation that only young blood can kindle. Silas Tomlin sank into a chair, as he heard the street-door slammed. \"Disgrace him! My God! I\u0027ve already disgraced him, and when he finds it out he\u0027ll hate me. Oh, Lord!\" If the man\u0027s fountain of tears had not been dried up years before, he would have wept scalding ones. An inner door opened and a negro woman peeped in. Seeing no one but Silas, she cried out indignantly, \"Who dat slammin\u0027 dat front do\u0027? You\u0027ll break eve\u0027y glass in de house, an\u0027 half de crock\u0027ry-ware in de dinin\u0027-room, an\u0027 den you\u0027ll say I done it.\" \"It was Paul, Rhody; he was angry about something.\" The negro woman gave an indignant snort. \"I don\u0027t blame \u0027im—I don\u0027t blame \u0027im; not one bit. Ain\u0027t I been tellin\u0027 you how \u0027twould be? Ain\u0027t I been tellin\u0027 you dat you\u0027d run \u0027im off wid yo\u0027 scrimpin\u0027 an\u0027 pinchin\u0027? But \u0027tain\u0027t dat dat run\u0027d \u0027im off. It\u0027s sump\u0027n wuss\u0027n dat. He ain\u0027t never done dat away befo\u0027. Ef dat boy ain\u0027t had de patience er Job, he\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 been gone fum here long ago.\" Rhody came into the room where she could look Silas in the eyes. He regarded her with curiosity, which appeared to be the only emotion left him. Certainly he had never seen his cook and aforetime slave in such a tantrum. What would she say and do next? \"Home!\" she exclaimed in a loud voice. Then she turned around and deliberately inspected the room as if she had never seen it before. \"An\u0027 so dis is what you call Home—you, wid all yo\u0027 money hid away in holes in de groun\u0027! Dis de kinder place you fix up fer dat boy, an\u0027 him de onliest one you got! Well!\" Rhody\u0027s indignation could only be accounted for on the ground that she had overheard the whole conversation between father and son. \"Why, you never said anything about it before,\" remarked Silas Tomlin. \"No, I didn\u0027t, an\u0027 I wouldn\u0027t say it now, ef dat boy hadn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 foun\u0027 out fer hisse\u0027f what kinder daddy he got.\" \"Blast your black hide! I\u0027ll knock your brains out if you talk that way to me!\" exclaimed Silas Tomlin, white with anger. \"Well, I bet you nobody don\u0027t knock yo\u0027 brains out,\" remarked Rhody undismayed. \"An\u0027 while I\u0027m \u0027bout it, I\u0027ll tell you dis: Yo\u0027 supper\u0027s in dar in de pots an\u0027 pans; ef you want it you go git it an\u0027 put on de table, er set flat on de h\u0027ath an\u0027 eat it. Dat chile\u0027s gone, an\u0027 I\u0027m gwine.\" \"You dratted fool!\" Silas exclaimed, \"you know Paul hasn\u0027t gone for good. He\u0027ll come back when he gets hungry, and be glad to come.\" \"Is you ever seed him do dis away befo\u0027 sence he been born?\" Rhody paused and waited for a reply, but none was forthcoming. \"No, you ain\u0027t! no, you ain\u0027t! You don\u0027t know no mo\u0027 \u0027bout dat chile dan ef he want yone. But I—me—ol\u0027 Rhody—I know \u0027im. I kin look at \u0027im sideways an\u0027 tell ef he feelin\u0027 good er bad er diffunt. What you done done ter dat chile? Tell me dat.\" But Silas Tomlin answered never a word. He sat glowering at Rhody in a way that would have subdued and frightened a negro unused to his ways. Rhody started toward the kitchen, but at the door leading to the dining-room she paused and turned around. \"Oh, you got a heap ter answer fer—a mighty heap; an\u0027 de day will come when you\u0027ll bar in mind eve\u0027y word I been tellin\u0027 you \u0027bout dat chile fum de time he could wobble \u0027roun\u0027 an\u0027 call me mammy.\" With that she went out. Silas heard her moving about in the back part of the house, but after awhile all was silence. He sat for some time communing with himself, and trying in vain to map out some consistent course of action. What a blessing it would be, he thought, if Paul would make good his threat, and go away! It would be like tearing his father\u0027s heart-strings out, but better that than that he should remain and be a witness to his own disgrace, and to the bitter humiliation of his father. Silas had intended to warn his son that he was throwing away his time by going with Eugenia Claiborne—that marriage with her was utterly impossible. But it was a very delicate subject, and, once embarked in it, he would have been unable to give his son any adequate or satisfactory reason for the interdiction. Many wild and whirling thoughts passed through the mind of Silas Tomlin, but at the end, he asked himself why he should cross the creek before he came to it? The reflection was soothing enough to bring home to his mind the fact that he had had no supper. Unconsciously, and through force of habit, he had been waiting for Rhody to set the small bell to tinkling, as a signal that the meal was ready, but no sound had come to his ears. He rose to investigate. A solitary candle was flaring on the dining-table. He went to the door leading to the kitchen and called Rhody, but he received no answer. \"Blast your impudent hide!\" he exclaimed, \"what are you doing out there? Why don\u0027t you put supper on the table?\" He would have had silence for an answer, but for the barking of a nearby neighbour\u0027s dog. He went into the kitchen, and found the fire nearly out, whereupon he made dire threats against his cook, but, in the end, he was compelled to fish his supper from the pans as best he could. When he had finished he looked at the clock, and was surprised to find that it was only a little after eight. During the course of an hour and a half, he seemed to have lived and suffered a year and a half. The early hour gave him an opportunity to display one of his characteristic traits. It had never been his way to run from trouble. When a small boy, if his nurse told him the booger-man was behind a bush, he always insisted on investigating. The same impulse seized him now. If this Mrs. Claiborne proposed to make any move against him—as he inferred from the hints which the jovial Mr. Sanders had flung at his head—he would beard the lioness in her den, and find out what she meant, and what she wanted. Silas was prompt to act on the impulse, and as soon as he could make the house secure, he proceeded to the Gaither Place. His knock, after some delay, was answered by Eugenia. The girl involuntarily drew back when she saw who the visitor was. \"What is it you wish?\" she inquired. \"If your mother is at home, please ask her if she will see Silas Tomlin on a matter of business.\" Eugenia left the door open, and in a moment, from one of the rear rooms came the sound of merry, unrestrained laughter, which only ceased when some one uttered a warning \"Sh-h!\" Eugenia returned almost immediately, and invited the visitor into the parlour, saying, \"It is rather late for business, mamma says, but she will see you.\" Silas seated himself on a sofa, and had time to look about him before the lady of the house came in. It was his second visit to Mrs. Claiborne, and he observed many changes had taken place in the disposition of the furniture and the draperies. He noted, too, with a feeling of helpless exasperation, that his own portrait hung on the wall in close proximity to that of Rita Claiborne. He clenched his hands with inward rage. \"What does this she-devil mean?\" he asked himself, and at that moment, the object of his anger swept into the room. There was something gracious, as well as graceful, in her movements. She had the air of a victor who is willing to be magnanimous. \"What is your business with me?\" she asked with lifted eyebrows. There was just the shadow of a smile hovering around her mouth. Silas caught it, and looking into a swinging mirror opposite, he saw how impossible it was for a man with a weazened face and a skull-cap to cope with such a woman as this. However, he had his indignation, his sense of persecution, to fall back upon. \"I want to know what you intend to do,\" said Silas. There was a note of weakness and helplessness in his voice. \"I want to know what to expect. I\u0027m tired of leading a dog\u0027s life. I hear you have been colloguing with lawyers.\" \"Do you remember your first visit here?\" inquired Mrs. Claiborne very sweetly. If she was an enemy, she certainly knew how to conceal her feelings. \"Do you remember how wildly you talked—how insulting you were?\" \"I declare to you on my honour that I never intended to insult you,\" Silas exclaimed. \"Why, all your insinuations were insulting. You gave me to understand that my coming here was an outrage—as if you had anything to do with my movements. But you insisted that my coming here was an attack on you and your son. When and where and how did I ever do you a wrong?\" \"Why didn\u0027t you—didn\u0027t—\" Silas tried hard to formulate his wrongs, but they were either so many or so few that words failed him. \"Did I desert you when you were ill and delirious? Did I put faith in an anonymous letter and believe you to be dead?\" The lady spoke with a calmness that seemed to be unnatural and unreal. For a little while, Silas made no reply, but sat like one dazed, his eyes fixed on the crayon portrait of himself. \"Did you hang that thing up there for Paul to see it and ask questions about it?\" he asked, after awhile. \"I hung it there because I chose to,\" she replied. \"Judge Vardeman thinks it is a very good likeness of you, but I don\u0027t agree with him. Do you think it does you justice?\" she asked. \"And then there\u0027s Paul,\" said Silas, ignoring her question. \"Do you propose to let him go ahead and fall in love with the girl?\" \"Paul is not my son,\" the lady calmly answered. \"But the girl is your daughter,\" Silas insisted. \"I shall look after her welfare, never fear,\" said the lady. \"But suppose they should take a notion to marry; what would you do to stop \u0027em?\" \"Oh, well, that is a question for the future,\" replied the lady, serenely. \"It will be time enough to discuss that matter when the necessity arises.\" Her composure, her indifference, caused Silas to writhe and squirm in his chair, and she, seeing the torture she was inflicting, appeared to be very well content. \"I didn\u0027t come to argue,\" said Silas presently. \"I came for information; I want to know what you intend to do. I don\u0027t ask any favours and I don\u0027t want any; I\u0027m getting my deserts, I reckon. What I sowed that I\u0027m reaping.\" \"Ah!\" the lady exclaimed softly, and with an air of satisfaction. \"Do you really feel so?\" She leaned forward a little, and there was that in her eyes that denoted something else besides satisfaction; compassion shone there. Her mood had not been a serious one up to this point, but she was serious now, and Silas could but observe how beautiful she was. \"Do you really feel that I would be justified if I confirmed the suspicions you have expressed?\" \"So far as I am concerned, you\u0027d be doing exactly right,\" said Silas bluntly. \"But what about Paul?\" \"Well, what about Paul?\" Mrs. Claiborne asked. \"Well, for one thing, he\u0027s never done you any harm. And there\u0027s another thing,\" said Silas rising from his seat: \"I\u0027d be willing to have my body pulled to pieces, inch by inch, and my bones broken, piece by piece, to save that boy one single pang.\" He stood towering over the lady. For once he had been taken clean out of himself, and he seemed to be transfigured. Mrs. Claiborne rose also. \"Paul is a very good young man,\" she said. \"Yes, he is!\" exclaimed Silas. \"He never had a mean thought, and he has never been guilty of a mean action. But that would make no difference in my feelings. It would be all the same to me if he was a thief and a scoundrel or if he was deformed, or if he was everything that he is not. No matter what he was or might be, I would be willing to live in eternal torment if I could know that he is happy.\" His face was not weazened now. It was illuminated with his love for his son, the one passion of his life, and he was no longer a contemptible figure. The lady refixed her eyes upon him, and wondered how he could have changed himself right before her eyes, for certainly, as it seemed to her, this was not the mean and shabby figure she had found in the parlour when she first came in. She sighed as she turned her eyes away. \"Do you remember what I told you on the occasion of your first visit?\" she inquired very seriously. \"You were both rude and disagreeable, but I said that I\u0027d not trouble you again, so long as you left me alone.\" \"Well, haven\u0027t I left you alone?\" asked Silas. \"What do you call this?\" There was just the shadow of a smile on her face. \"That\u0027s a fact,\" said Silas after a pause. \"But I just couldn\u0027t help myself. Honestly I\u0027m sorry I came. I\u0027m no match for you. I must bid you good-night. I hardly know what\u0027s come over me. If I\u0027ve worried you, I\u0027m truly sorry.\" \"One of these days,\" she said very kindly, as she accompanied him to the door, \"I\u0027ll send for you. At the proper time I\u0027ll give you some interesting news.\" \"Well, I hope it will be good news; if so, it will be the first I have heard in many a long day. Good-night.\" The lady closed the door, and returned to the parlour and sat down. \"Why, I thought he was a cold-blooded, heartless creature,\" she said to herself. Then, after some reflection she uttered an exclamation and clasped her hands together. Suppose he were to make way with himself! The bare thought was enough to keep the smiles away from the face of this merry-hearted lady for many long minutes. Finally, she caught a glimpse of herself in the swinging mirror. She snapped her fingers at her reflection, saying, \"Pooh! I wouldn\u0027t give that for your firmness of purpose!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77503.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
