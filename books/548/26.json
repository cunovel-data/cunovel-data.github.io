{"id":23597,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE Mr. Sanders\u0027s Riddle","content":"\"I tell you how it is,\" said Mr. Sanders: \"The riddle is how to git a message to Gabriel; I could git the Captain thar to take it, but the Captain will have as much as he can attend to, an\u0027 for that matter, so have I. Wi\u0027 this riddle I\u0027m overcrapped. Sence I left here, I\u0027ve gone over the whole matter in my mind, ef you can call it a mind. I could go down thar myself, an\u0027 I\u0027d be glad to, but could I git to have a private talk wi\u0027 Gabriel? I reckon not.\" The remark was really interrogative, and was addressed to Captain Falconer, who made a prompt reply—\"I hardly think the scheme would work. My impression is that orders have been issued from Atlanta for these young men to be isolated. If that is so they can hold communication with no one but the sentinel on duty, or the officer who has charge of them. They are to be treated as felons, though nothing has been proved against them. I am not sure, but I think that is the programme.\" \"That is about what I thought,\" said Mr. Sanders, \"an\u0027 that\u0027s what I told Cephas here. When I was fetchin\u0027 my horse, Cephas, he comes up, an\u0027 he says, \u0027Mr. Sanders, have you heard from Gabriel?\u0027 an\u0027 I says, \u0027No, Cephas, we ain\u0027t had time for to git a word from \u0027em.\u0027 An\u0027 then he went on to say, Cephas did, that he\u0027d like mighty well to see Gabriel. I told him that maybe we could fix it up so as he could see Gabriel. You can\u0027t imagine how holp up the little chap was. To see him then, an\u0027 see him now, you\u0027d think it was another boy.\" Captain Falconer looked at Cephas, and could see no guile. On the contrary, he saw a freckled lad who appeared to be about ten years old; he was really nearly fourteen. Cephas was so ugly that he was ugly when he laughed, as he was doing now; but there was something about him that attracted the attention of those who were older. It was a fact much talked about that this freckled little boy never went with children of his own age, but was always to be found with those much older. He was Gabriel\u0027s chum when Gabriel wanted a chum; he went hunting with Francis Bethune; and he could often be found at the store in which Paul Tomlin was the chief clerk. He knew all the secrets of these young men, and kept them, and they frequently advised with him about the young ladies. But he was fonder of Gabriel than of all the rest, and he was also fond of Nan, who had been kind to him in many ways. Cephas was one of those ill-favoured little creatures, who astonish everybody by never forgetting a favour. Gratitude ran riot in his small bosom, and he was ever ready to sacrifice himself for his friends. Seeing that Captain Falconer continued to look at him, Cephas hung his head. He was only too conscious of his ugliness, and was very sensitive about it. He wanted to be large and strong and handsome like Gabriel, or dark and romantic-looking like Francis Bethune; and sometimes he was very miserable because of the unkindness of fate or Providence in this matter. \"And so you want to see your friends,\" said the Captain, very kindly. Every feature of his face showed that his sympathies were keen. \"They are very far away, or will be when they get to their journey\u0027s end—too far, I should think, for a little boy to travel.\" \"Maybe so,\" said Cephas, \"but Gabriel had to go.\" \"I see,\" said the Captain; \"wherever Gabriel goes, you are willing to go?\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied Cephas very simply. \"I hope Gabriel appreciates it,\" remarked Sarah Clopton. \"Oh, he does!\" exclaimed Cephas. \"Gabriel knows. Why, one day——\" Then, remembering the company he was in, he blushed, and refused to go on with what he intended to say. Seeing his embarrassment, Mr. Sanders came to his rescue. \"What I want to know, Captain, is this: if that little chap comes down to Savannah, will you allow him to see Gabriel and talk to him?\" Again the Captain looked at the boy, and Cephas, catching a certain humourous gleam in the gentleman\u0027s eye, began to smile. \"Now, then,\" said Captain Falconer, with an answering smile, \"how would you like to go with me?\" \"I think I would like it,\" replied Cephas, with a broad grin; \"I think that would be fine.\" \"And what does Mr. Sanders think of it?\" the Captain asked. \"Well, I hadn\u0027t looked at it from that p\u0027int of view,\" said Mr. Sanders. \"I \u0027lowed maybe that the best an\u0027 cheapest plan would be for me to take the little chap down an\u0027 fetch him back.\" \"My opinion may not be worth much, Mr. Sanders,\" said Sarah Clopton, \"but I think it would be a shame to take that child so far away from home. I don\u0027t believe his mother will allow him to go.\" \"That is a matter that was jest fixin\u0027 for to worry me,\" remarked Mr. Sanders. \"I could feel it kinder fermentin\u0027 in my mind, like molasses turnin\u0027 to vinegar, an\u0027 now that you\u0027ve fetched it to the top, Sarah, we\u0027ll settle it before we go any furder. Come, Cephas; we\u0027ll go an\u0027 see your mammy, an\u0027 see ef we can\u0027t coax her into lettin\u0027 you go. You\u0027ll have to do your best, my son; I\u0027ll coax, an\u0027 you must wheedle.\" As they went out, Cephas was laughing at Mr. Sanders\u0027s remark about wheedling. The youngster was an expert in that business. He was his mother\u0027s only child, and he had learned at a very early age just how to manage her. \"What troubles me, Cephas,\" said Mr. Sanders, \"is how you can git a message to Gabriel wi\u0027out lettin\u0027 the cat out\u0027n the bag. He\u0027ll be surrounder\u0027d in sech a way that you can\u0027t git a word wi\u0027 \u0027im wi\u0027out tellin\u0027 the whole caboodle.\" At that moment, Mr. Sanders heard a small voice cry out something like this: \"Phazasee! Phazasee! arawa ooya ingagog?\" To which jabbering Cephas made prompt reply: \"Iya ingagog ota annysavvy ota eesa gibbleable!\" \"Ooya ibfa! Ooya ibfa!\" jeered the small voice. Mr. Sanders looked at Cephas in astonishment. \"What kinder lingo is that?\" he asked. \"It\u0027s the way we school-children talk when we don\u0027t want anybody to know what we are saying. Johnny asked me where I was going, and I told him I was going to Savannah to see Gabriel.\" \"Did he know what you said?\" \"Why, he couldn\u0027t help but know, but he didn\u0027t believe it; he said it was a fib.\" \"Well, I\u0027ll be jigged!\" exclaimed Mr. Sanders. \"Call that boy over here.\" Cephas turned around—they had passed the house where the little boy lived—and called out: \"Onnaja! Onnaja! Stermera Andersa antwasa ota eesa ooya.\" The small boy came running, though there was a doubtful look on his face. He had frequently been the victim of Cephas\u0027s practical jokes. Mr. Sanders questioned him closely, and he confirmed the interpretation of the lingo which Cephas had given to Mr. Sanders. \"Do you mean to tell me,\" said Mr. Sanders to Cephas when they had dismissed the small boy, \"that this kinder thing has been goin\u0027 on right under my nose, an\u0027 I not knowin\u0027 a word about it? How\u0027d you pick up the lingo?\" \"Gabriel teached it to me,\" replied Cephas. \"He talks it better than any of the boys, and I come next.\" This last remark Cephas made with a blush. \"Do I look pale, my son?\" inquired Mr. Sanders, mopping his red face with his handkerchief. Cephas gave a negative reply by shaking his head. \"Well, I may not look pale, but I shorely feel pale. You\u0027ll have to loan me your arm, Cephas; I feel like Christopher Columbus did when he discovered Atlanta, Ga.\" \"Why, he didn\u0027t discover Atlanta, Mr. Sanders,\" protested Cephas. \"He didn\u0027t!\" exclaimed Mr. Sanders. \"Well, it was his own fault ef he didn\u0027t. All he had to do was to read the country newspapers. But that\u0027s neither here nor thar. Here I\u0027ve been buttin\u0027 my head ag\u0027in trees, an\u0027 walkin\u0027 in my sleep tryin\u0027 for to study up some plan to git word to Gabriel, an\u0027 here you walk along the street an\u0027 make me a present of the very thing I want, an\u0027 I ain\u0027t even thanked you for it.\" Cephas couldn\u0027t guess what Mr. Sanders was driving at, and he asked no questions. His mind was too full of his proposed trip. When the proposition was first broached to Cephas\u0027s mother, she scouted the idea of allowing her boy to make the journey. He was all she had, and should anything happen to him—well, the world wouldn\u0027t be the same world to her. And it was so far away; why, she had heard some one say that Savannah was right on the brink of the ocean—that great monster that swallowed ships and men by the thousand, and was just as hungry afterward as before. But Cephas began to cry, saying that he wanted to see Gabriel; and Mr. Sanders told Gabriel\u0027s side of the story. Between the two, the poor woman had no option but to say that she\u0027d consider the matter, and when a woman begins to consider—well, according to the ancient philosophers, it\u0027s the same as saying yes. The truth is, a great deal of pressure was brought to bear on Cephas\u0027s mother, in one way and another. Meriwether Clopton called on her, bringing Captain Falconer. She was not at all pleased to see the Captain, and she made no effort to conceal her prejudice. \"I never did think that I\u0027d speak to a man in that uniform,\" she said with a very red face. But she was better satisfied when Meriwether Clopton told her that the Captain was the son of his dearest friend, and that he was utterly opposed to the radical policy. The upshot of the matter was that, with many a sigh and some tears, she gave her consent for her onliest, her dearest, and her bestest, to go on the long journey. And then, after consenting, she was angry with herself because she had consented. In short, she was as miserable and as anxious as mother-love can make a woman, and poor Cephas never could understand until he became a grown man, and had children of his own, how his mother could make such a to-do over the opportunity that Providence had thrown in his way. To tell the truth, he was almost irritated at the obstacles and objections that the vivid imagination of his mother kept conjuring up. She said he must be sure not to fall in the ocean, and he must keep out of the way of the railroad trains. She cried silently all the time she was packing his modest supply of clothes in a valise, and put some tea-cakes in one corner, and a little Testament in the other. It is no wonder that children who do not understand such feelings should be impatient of them, and Cephas is to be excused if he watched the whole proceeding with something like contempt for woman\u0027s weakness. But he has bitterly regretted, oh, tens of thousands of times, that, instead of standing aloof from his mother\u0027s feelings, he did not throw his arms around her, and tell how much he appreciated her love, and how every tear she shed for him was worth to him a hundred times more than a diamond. But Cephas was a boy, and, being a boy, he could not rise superior to his boy\u0027s nature. It was arranged that Cephas was to go to Savannah with Captain Falconer, and return with Mr. Sanders, who would take advantage of the occasion to settle up some old business with the firm that had acted as factor for Meriwether Clopton before the war. The arrangement took place when Mr. Sanders returned home after his visit to Cephas\u0027s mother, and was of course conditional on her consent, which was not obtained at once. Mr. Sanders was shrewd enough not to dwell too much on the plight of the young men on his return. By some method of his own, he seemed to sweep the whole matter from his mind, and both he and Meriwether Clopton addressed themselves to such topics as they imagined the Federal Captain would find interesting; and in this they were seconded by Sarah Clopton, whom Robert Toombs declared to be one of the finest conversationalists of her time when she chose to exert her powers. But for the softness and fine harmony of her features, her face would have been called masculine. Her countenance was entirely responsive to her emotions, and it was delightful to watch the eloquent play of her features. Captain Falconer fell quickly under the spell of her conversation, for one of its chiefest charms was the ease with which she brought out the best thoughts of his mind—thoughts and views that were a part of his inner self. It was the same at dinner, where, without monopolising the talk, she led it this way and that, but always in channels that were congenial and pleasing to the Captain, and that enabled him to appear at his best. In honour of his guest, Meriwether Clopton brought out some fine old claret that had lain for many years undisturbed in the cellar. \"Thank you, Sarah,\" said Mr. Sanders, when the hostess pressed him to have a glass, \"I\u0027ll not trouble you for any to-day. I\u0027ve made the acquaintance of that claret. It ain\u0027t sour enough for vinegar, nor strong enough for liquor; it\u0027s a kind of a cross betwixt a second drawin\u0027 of tea an\u0027 the syrup of squills; an\u0027 no matter how hard you hit it it\u0027ll never hit you back. It\u0027s lots too mild for a Son of Temp\u0027rance like me. No; gi\u0027 me a full jug an\u0027 a shuck-pen to crawl into, an\u0027 you may have all the wine, red or yaller.\" But the fine old claret was thoroughly enjoyed by those who could appreciate the flower of its age and the flavour of its vintage; and when dinner was over, and Captain Falconer was on his way to camp, he felt that, outside of his own home, he had never had such a pleasant experience. In the course of a few days orders came from Atlanta for Captain Falconer to turn over the command of the detachment to the officer next in rank, and proceed to Malvern, where he would find further instructions awaiting him. When the time came for Cephas to be off with the Captain, you may well believe that his mother saw all sorts of trouble ahead for him. She had dreamed some very queer dreams, she said, and she was very sure that no good would follow. And at the last moment, she would have taken Cephas from the barouche which had come for him, if the driver, following the instructions of Mr. Sanders, had not whipped up his horses, and left the lady standing in the street. As for Cephas, he found that parting from his mother was not such a fine thing after all. He watched her through a mist of tears, and waved his handkerchief as long as he could see her; and then after that he was the loneliest little fellow you have ever seen. He refused to eat the extra tea-cake that his mother had put in the pocket of his jacket, and made up his mind to be perfectly miserable until he got back home. But, after all, boys are boys, and the feeling of loneliness and dejection wore away after awhile, and before he had gone many miles, what with making the acquaintance of the driver, who was a private soldier, and getting on friendly terms with Captain Falconer, he soon arrived at the point where he relished his tea-cake, and when this had been devoured, he felt as if travelling was the most delightful thing in the world, especially if a fellow has been intrusted with a tremendous secret that nobody else in the world knew besides Mr. Sanders and himself. For as soon as Mr. Sanders discovered that the Captain would be willing to have Cephas go along, he had taken the little chap in hand, and thoroughly impressed upon his mind everything he wanted him to say to Gabriel, and he was not satisfied until Cephas had written the message out in the dog-latin of the school-children, and had learned it by heart. Mr. Sanders also impressed on the little lad\u0027s mind the probability that the Captain would be curious as to the nature of the message; and he gave Cephas a plausible answer for every question that an inquisitive person could put to him, and made him repeat these answers over and over again. In fact, Cephas was compelled to study as hard as if he had been in school, but he relished the part he was to play, and learned it with a zest that was very pleasing to Mr. Sanders. Only an hour before he was to leave with the Captain, Mr. Sanders went to Cephas\u0027s home, and made him repeat over everything he had been taught, and the glibness with which the little lad repeated the answers to the questions was something wonderful in so small a chap. \"Don\u0027t git lonesome, Cephas,\" was the parting injunction of Mr. Sanders. \"Don\u0027t forgit that I\u0027ll be on the train when the whistle blows. I\u0027m gwine to start right off. You may not see me, but I\u0027ll not be far off. Keep a stiff upper lip, an\u0027 don\u0027t git into no panic. The whole thing is gwine through like it was on skids, an\u0027 the skids greased.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77512.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
