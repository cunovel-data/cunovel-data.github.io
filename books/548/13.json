{"id":23584,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER TWELVE Caught in a Corner","content":"It was no difficult matter for Nan Dorrington to infer what course of action Gabriel intended to pursue. The union Leagues established in the South under the auspices of the political department of the Freedman\u0027s Bureau had already excited the suspicion of the whites. The reputation they instantly achieved was extremely sinister, and they had become the source of much uneasiness. There was an air of mystery about them which, however pleasing it might be to the negroes, was not at all relished by those who had been made the victims of radical legislation. There were wild rumours to the effect that the object of these leagues was to organise the negroes and prepare them for an armed attack on the whites. These rumours were to be seen spread out in the newspapers, and were to be heard wherever people gathered together. Nan was familiar with them, and, while both she and Gabriel were possibly too young to harbour all the anxieties entertained by their elders, they nevertheless took a very keen interest in the situation; and it was not less keen because it had curiosity for its basis. Gabriel had no sooner digested the purport of the conversation to which he had listened than he made up his mind to unravel, if he could, the mystery of the union League, and to discover what part the new-comer, the companion of the Rev. Jeremiah Tomlin, proposed to play. It was characteristic of the lad that he should act promptly. When he left Nan so unceremoniously, he ran to the Clopton Place to report what he had heard to Mr. Sanders, but he found that worthy citizen in no condition to give him aid, or even advice. Meriwether Clopton chanced to be in consultation with some gentleman from Atlanta, and could not be seen, while Francis Bethune was said to be in town somewhere. It was then that Gabriel made up his mind that he would act alone. He knew the old school-house in which the league was to be organised, as well as he knew his own home. It had formerly been called the Shady Dale Male Academy, and its reputation, before the war, had gone far and wide. Gabriel had spent many a happy hour there, and some that were memorably unpleasant, especially during the term that a school-master by the name of McManus wielded the rod. Among the things that Gabriel remembered was the fact that the space under the stairway—the building had two stories—was boarded up so as to form a large closet, where the pupils deposited their extra coats and wraps, as well as their lunches. The closet had also been used as a reformatory for refractory pupils, and this was one reason why Gabriel remembered it so well; he had spent numerous uncomfortable hours there at a time when darkness and isolation had real terrors for him. The building had been abandoned by the whites during the war, and was for a time used as a hospital. At the close of the war it was turned over to the negroes, who established there a flourishing school, which was presided over by a native Southerner, an old gentleman whom the war had stripped of this world\u0027s goods. Gabriel thought it best to begin operations before the sun went down. He made a detour wide enough to place the school-house between him and Shady Dale, so that if by any chance his movements should attract attention he would have the appearance of approaching the building quite by accident. Under the circumstances, it was perhaps fortunate that he took this precaution, for when he drew near the school-house, the Rev. Jeremiah Tomlin was standing in the back door flourishing a broom. \"Hello, Jeremiah!\" said Gabriel by way of salutation. \"What\u0027s up now?\" \"Good-evenin\u0027, Mister Gabe,\" responded the Rev. Jeremiah. \"Dey been havin\u0027 some plasterin\u0027 done in my chu\u0027ch, suh, an\u0027 we \u0027lowd we\u0027d hol\u0027 pra\u0027r-meetin\u0027 here ter-night. An\u0027 I\u0027ll tell you why, suh: You know mighty well how we coloured folks does—we ain\u0027t got nothin\u0027 fer ter hide, an\u0027 we couldn\u0027t hide it ef we did had sump\u0027n. Well, suh, dem mongst us what got any erligion is bleeze ter show it; when de sperret move um, dey bleeze ter let one an\u0027er know it; an\u0027 in dat way, suh, dey do a heap er movin\u0027 \u0027bout. Dey rastles wid Satan, ez you may say, when dey gits in a weavin\u0027 way; an\u0027 I wuz fear\u0027d, suh, dat dey mought shake de damp plasterin\u0027 down.\" \"But you have no pulpit here,\" suggested Gabriel, who associated a pulpit with all religious gatherings. \"So much de better, suh,\" replied the Rev. Jeremiah. \"Ef you wuz ter come ter my chu\u0027ch, you\u0027d allers see me come down when I gits warmed up. Dey ain\u0027t no pulpit big nuff for me long about dat time. No, suh; I\u0027m bleeze ter have elbow-room, an\u0027 I\u0027m mighty glad dey ain\u0027t no pulpit in here. But whar you been, Mr. Gabe?\" inquired the Rev. Jeremiah, craftily changing the subject. \"Just walking about in the woods and fields,\" answered Gabriel. \"\u0027Twant no use fer ter ax you, suh; you been doin\u0027 dat sence you wuz big nuff ter clime a fence. Ef you wan\u0027t wid Miss Nan, you wuz by yo\u0027se\u0027f. I uv seed you many a day, suh, when you didn\u0027t see me. You wuz wid Miss Nan dis ve\u0027y day.\" The Rev. Jeremiah dropped his head to one side, and smiled a knowing smile. \"Oh, you needn\u0027t be shame un it, suh,\" the negro went on as the colour slowly mounted to Gabriel\u0027s face. \"I uv said it befo\u0027 an\u0027 I\u0027ll say it ag\u0027in, an\u0027 I don\u0027t keer who hears me—Miss Nan is boun\u0027 ter make de finest \u0027oman in de lan\u0027. An\u0027 dat ain\u0027t all, suh: when I hear folks hintin\u0027 dat she\u0027s gwine ter make a match wid Mr. Frank Bethune, sez I, \u0027Des keep yo\u0027 eye on Mr. Gabe\u0027; dat zackly what I sez.\" \"Oh, the dickens and Tom Walker!\" exclaimed Gabriel impatiently; \"who\u0027s been talking of the affairs of Miss Dorrington in that way?\" \"Why, purty nigh eve\u0027ybody, suh,\" remarked the Rev. Jeremiah, smacking his lips. \"What white folks say in de parlour, you kin allers hear in de kitchen.\" After firing this homely truth at Gabriel, the Rev. Jeremiah went to work with his broom and made a great pretence of sweeping and moving the benches about. The lad followed him in, and looked about him with interest. It was the first time he had revisited the old school-house since he was a boy of ten, and he was pleased to find that there had been few changes. The desk at which he had sat was intact. His initials, rudely carved, stared him in the face, and there, too, was the hole he had cut in the seat. He remembered that this was a dungeon in which he had imprisoned many a fly. These mute evidences of his idleness seemed to be as solid as the hills. Between those times and the present, the wild and furious perspective of war lay spread out, and Gabriel could imagine that the idler who had hacked the desk belonged to another generation altogether. He went to the blackboard, found a piece of chalk, and wrote in a large, bold hand: \"Rev. Jeremiah Tomlin will lecture here to-night, beginning at early candle-light.\" The Rev. Jeremiah, witnessing the performance, had his curiosity aroused: \"What is de word you uv writ, suh?\" he inquired, and when Gabriel had read it off, the negro exclaimed, \"Well, suh! You put all dat down, an\u0027 it didn\u0027t take you no time; no, suh, not no time. But I might uv speckted it, bekase I hear lots er talk about how smart you is on all sides—dey all sesso.\" \"Does Tasma Tid belong to your church?\" Gabriel inquired with a most innocent air. \"Do which, suh?\" exclaimed Rev. Jeremiah, pausing with his broom suspended in the air. When Gabriel repeated his inquiry, the Rev. Jeremiah drew a deep breath, his nostrils dilated, and he seemed to grow several inches taller. \"No, suh, she do not; no, suh, she do not belong ter my chu\u0027ch. You kin look at her, suh, an\u0027 see de mark er de Ol\u0027 Boy on her. She got de hoodoo eye, suh; an\u0027 de blue gums dat go long wid it, an\u0027 ef she wuz ter jine my chu\u0027ch, she\u0027d be de only member.\" It was very clear to Gabriel that nothing was to be gained by remaining, so he bade the Rev. Jeremiah good-bye, and went toward Shady Dale. When he was well out of sight, the negro approached the blackboard, and, with the most patient curiosity, examined the inscription or announcement that Gabriel had written. With his forefinger, he traced over the lines, as if in that way he might absorb the knowledge that was behind the writing. Then, stepping back a few paces, he viewed the writing critically. Finally he shook his head doubtfully, exclaiming aloud: \"Dat\u0027s whar dey\u0027ll git us—yes, suh, dat\u0027s whar dey sho\u0027 will git us.\" After which, he carefully closed the doors of the school-house and followed the path leading to Shady Dale—the path that Gabriel had taken. The Rev. Jeremiah mumbled as he walked along, giving oral utterance to his thoughts, but in a tone too low to reveal their import. He had taken a step which it was now too late to retrace. He was not a vicious negro. In common with the great majority of his race—in common, perhaps with the men of all races—he was eaten up by a desire to become prominent, to make himself conspicuous. Generations of civilisation (as it is called) have gone far to tone down this desire in the whites, and they manage to control it to some extent, though now and then we see it crop out in individuals. But there had been no toning down of the Rev. Jeremiah\u0027s egotism; on the contrary, it had been fed by the flattery of his congregation until it was gross and rank. It was natural, therefore, under all the circumstances, that the Rev. Jeremiah should become the willing tool of the politicians and adventurers who had accepted the implied invitation of the radical leaders of the Republican Party to assist in the spoliation of the South. The Rev. Jeremiah, once he had been patted on the back, and addressed as Mr. Tomlin by a white man, and that man a representative of the Government, was quite ready to believe anything he was told by his new friends, and quite as ready to aid them in carrying out any scheme that their hatred of the South and their natural rapacity could suggest or invent. Therefore, let it not be supposed that the Rev. Jeremiah, as he went along the path, mumbling out his thoughts, was expressing any doubt of the wisdom or expediency of the part he was expected to play in arraying the negroes against the whites. No; he was simply putting together as many sonorous phrases as he could remember, and storing them away in view of the contingency that he would be called on to address those of his race who might be present at the organisation of the union League. He had been very busy since his conference with the agent of the Freedman\u0027s Bureau, and, in one way and another, had managed to convey information of the proposed meeting to quite a number of the negroes; and in performing this service he was careful that a majority of those notified should be members of his church—negroes with whom his influence was all-powerful. But he had also invited Uncle Plato, Clopton\u0027s carriage-driver, Wiley Millirons, and Walthall\u0027s Jake, three of the worthiest and most sensible negroes to be found anywhere. While the Rev. Jeremiah, full of his own importance, and swelling with childish vanity, was making his way toward Neighbour Tomlin\u0027s, on whose lot he had a house, rent free, there were other plotters at work. In addition to Gabriel Tolliver, Nan Dorrington was a plotter to be reckoned with, especially when she had as her copartner Tasma Tid, who was as cunning as some wild thing. When the day was far spent, or, as Mrs. Absalom would say, \"along to\u0027rds the shank of the evenin\u0027,\" Nan and Tasma Tid went wandering out of town in the direction of the school-house. The excuse Nan had given at home was that she wanted to see Tasma Tid\u0027s hiding-place. As they passed Tomlin\u0027s, they saw the Rev. Jeremiah splitting wood for his wife, who was the cook. At sight of Jeremiah, Tasma Tid began to laugh, and she laughed so long and so loud that the parson paused in his labours and looked at her. He took off his hat and bowed to Nan, whereupon Tasma Tid raised her hand above her head, and indulged in a series of wild gesticulations, which, to the Rev. Jeremiah, were very mysterious and puzzling. He shook his head dubiously, and mopped his face with a large red handkerchief. \"What are you trying to do to Jeremiah?\" inquired Nan, as they went along. \"Him fool nigger. We make him dream bad dream,\" responded Tasma Tid curtly. The two were in no hurry. They sauntered along leisurely, and, although the sun had not set, by the time they had entered the woods in which the school-house stood, the deep shadows of the trees gave the effect of twilight to the scene. Tasma Tid led Nan to the old building, and told her to wait a moment. The African crawled under the house, and then suddenly reappeared at the back door, near which Nan stood waiting. Tasma Tid had crawled under the house, and lifted a loose plank in the floor of the closet, making her entrance in that way. The front door was locked and the key was safe in the pocket of the Rev. Jeremiah, but the back door was fastened on the inside, and Tasma Tid had no trouble in getting it open. It is fair to say that Nan hesitated before entering. Some instinct or presentiment held her a moment. She was not afraid; her sense of fear had never developed itself; it was one of the attributes of human nature that was foreign to her experience; and this was why some of her actions, when she was younger, and likewise when she was older, were inexplicable to the rest of her sex, and made her the object of criticism which seemed to have good ground to go upon. Nan hesitated with her foot on the step, but it was not her way to draw back, and she went in. Tasma Tid refastened the door very carefully, and then turned and led the way toward the closet. The room was not wholly dark; one or two of the shutters had fallen off, and in this way a little light filtered in. Nan followed Tasma Tid to the closet, the door of which was open. \"Dis-a we house,\" said Tasma Tid; \"dis-a de place wey we live at.\" \"Why did you come here?\" Nan asked. \"We had no nurrer place; all-a we frien\u0027 gone; da\u0027s why.\" What further comment Nan may have made cannot even be guessed, for at that moment there was a noise at one of the windows; some one was trying to raise the sash. Nan and Tasma Tid held their breath while they listened, and then, when they were sure that some one was preparing to enter the building, the African closed the closet door noiselessly, and pulled Nan after her to the narrowest and most uncomfortable part of the musty and dusty place—the space next the stairway, where it was so low that they were compelled to sit flat on the floor. The intruder, whoever he might be, crawled cautiously through the window—they could hear the buttons of his coat strike against the sill—and leaped lightly to the floor. He lowered the window again, and then, after tiptoeing about among the benches, came straight to the closet. As Tasma Tid had not taken time to fasten it on the inside, the door was easily opened. Dark as it was, Nan and the African could see that the intruder was a man, but, beyond this, they could distinguish nothing. Nan and her companion would have breathed freer if recognition had been possible, for the new-comer was Gabriel, who had determined to take this method of discovering the aim and object of the union League. Once in the closet, Gabriel took pains to make the inside fastenings secure. It was one of the whims of Mr. McManus, the school-master, who had so often caused Gabriel\u0027s head and the blackboard to meet, that the fastenings of this closet should be upon the inside. It tickled his humour to feel that a refractory boy should be his own jailer, able, and yet not daring, to release himself until the master should rap sharply on the door. Gabriel was less familiar with these fastenings than he had formerly been, and he fumbled about in the dark for some moments before he could adjust them to his satisfaction. He made no effort to explore the closet, taking for granted that it could have no other occupant. This was fortunate for Nan, for if he had moved about to any extent, he would inevitably have stumbled over the African and her young mistress, who were crouched and huddled as far under the stairway as they could get. Gabriel stood still a moment, as if listening, and then he sat flat on the floor, and stretched out his legs with a sigh of relief. After that there was a long period of silence, during which Nan had a fine opportunity to be very sorry that she had ever ventured out on such a fool\u0027s errand. \"If I get out of this scrape,\" she thought over and over again, \"I\u0027ll never be a tomboy; I\u0027ll never be a harum-scarum girl any more.\" She had no physical fear, but she realised that she was placed in a very awkward position. She was devoured with curiosity to know whether the intruder really was Gabriel. She hoped it was, and the hope caused her to blush in the dark. She knew she was blushing; she felt her ears burn—for what would Gabriel think if he knew that she was crouching on the floor, not more than an arm\u0027s length from him? Why, naturally, he would have no respect for her. How could he? she asked herself. As for Gabriel, he was sublimely unconscious of the fact that he was not alone. Once or twice he fancied he heard some one breathing, but he was a lad who was very close to nature, and he knew how many strange and varied sounds rise mysteriously out of the most profound silence; and so, instead of becoming suspicious, he became drowsy. He made himself as comfortable as he could, and leaned against the wall, pitting his patience against the loneliness of the place and the slow passage of time. Being a healthy lad, Gabriel would have gone to sleep then and there, but for a mysterious splutter and explosion, so to speak, which went off right at his elbow, as he supposed. He was in that neutral territory between sleeping and waking and he was unable to recognise the sound that had startled him; and it would have remained a mystery but for the fact that a sneeze is usually accompanied by its twin. Nan had for some time felt an inclination to sneeze, and the more she tried to resist it the greater the inclination grew, until finally, it culminated in the spluttering explosion that had aroused Gabriel. This was followed by a sneeze which he had no difficulty in recognising. The fact that some unknown person was a joint occupant of the closet upset him so little that he was surprised at himself. He remained perfectly quiet for awhile, endeavouring to map out a course of action, little knowing that Nan Dorrington was chewing her nails with anger a few feet from where he sat. \"Who are you?\" he asked finally. He spoke in a firm low tone. In another moment Nan\u0027s impulsiveness would have betrayed her, but Tasma Tid came to her rescue. \"Huccum you in we house? Whaffer you come dey? How you call you\u0027 name?\" \"Oh, shucks! Is that you, Tiddy Me Tas?\"—this was the way Gabriel sometimes twisted her name. \"I thought you were the booger-man. You\u0027d better run along home to your Miss Nan. She says she wants to see you. What are you hiding out here for anyway?\" \"We no hide, Misser Gable. \u0027Tis-a we house, dis. Honey Nan no want we; she no want nobody. She talkin\u0027 by dat Misser Frank what live-a down dey at Clopton. Dee got cake, dee got wine, dee got all de bittle dee want.\" Tasma Tid told this whopper in spite of the fact that Nan was giving her warning nudges and pinches. \"Yes, I reckon they are having a good time,\" said Gabriel gloomily. \"Miss Nan gave me an invitation, but I couldn\u0027t go.\" It was something new in Nan\u0027s experience to hear Gabriel call her Miss Nan, and she rather relished the sensation it gave her. She was now ready to believe that she was really and truly a young lady. \"Whaffer you ain\u0027t gone down dey?\" inquired Tasma Tid. \"Ef you kin come dis-a way, you kin go down dey.\" \"I was obliged to come here,\" responded Gabriel. \"Shoo! dem fib roll out lak dey been had grease on top um,\" exclaimed Tasma Tid derisively. \"Who been ax you fer come by dis way? \u0027Tis-a we house, dis. You better go, Misser Gable; go by dat place wey Honey Nan live, an\u0027 look in de blin\u0027 wey you see dat Misser Frank, and dat Misser Paul Tomlin, an\u0027 watch um how dee kin make love. Maybe you kin fin\u0027 out how fer make love you\u0027se\u0027f.\" Gabriel laughed uneasily. \"No, Tiddy Me Tas—no love-making for me. I\u0027m either too old or too young, I forget which.\" They ceased talking, for they heard footsteps outside, and the sound of voices. Presently some one opened the door, and it seemed from the noise that was made, the shuffling of feet, and the repressed tones of conversation, that a considerable number of negroes had responded to the Rev. Jeremiah\u0027s invitation. The first-comers evidently lit a candle, for a phantom-like shadow of light trickled through a small crack in the closet door, and a faint, but unmistakable, odour of a sulphur match readied Gabriel\u0027s nostrils. There were whispered consultations, and a good deal of muffled and subdued conversation, but every word that was distinctly enunciated was clearly heard in the sound-box of a closet. But suddenly all conversation ceased, and complete silence took possession of those present.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77499.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
