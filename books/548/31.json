{"id":23602,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER THIRTY Miss Polly Has Some News","content":"The news which Miss Polly had laid as a social offering at Mrs. Lucy Lumsden\u0027s feet, and which she boasted was very astonishing, had the appearance of absurdity on the face of it. Miss Polly, with her work-bag and her turkey-tail fan, had paid a very early visit to the Lumsden Place. She went in very quietly, greeted her old friend in a subdued manner, and then sat staring at her with an expression that Mrs. Lumsden failed to understand. It might have been the result of special and unmitigated woe, or of physical pain, or of severe fatigue. Whatever the cause, it was unnatural, and so Gabriel\u0027s grandmother made haste to inquire about it. \"Why, what in the world is the matter, Polly? Are you ill?\" At this Miss Polly acted as if she had been aroused from a dream or a revery. Her work-bag slid from her lap, and her turkey-tail fan would have fallen had it not been attached to her wrist by a piece of faded ribbon. \"I declare, Lucy, I don\u0027t know that I ought to tell you; and I wouldn\u0027t if I thought you would repeat it to a living soul. It is more than marvellous; it is, indeed, Lucy\"—leaning a little nearer, and lowering her voice, which was never very loud—\"I honestly believe that Ritta Claiborne is in love with old Silas Tomlin! I certainly do.\" \"You must have some reason for believing that,\" said Mrs. Lumsden, with a benevolent smile, the cause of which the ear-trumpet could not interpret. \"Reasons! I have any number, Lucy. I\u0027m certain you won\u0027t believe me, but it has come to that pass that old Silas calls on her every night, and they sit in the parlour there and talk by the hour, sometimes with Eugenia, and sometimes without her. It would be no exaggeration at all if I were to tell you that they are talking together in that parlour five nights out of the seven. Now, what do they mean by that?\" \"Why, there\u0027s nothing in that, Polly. I have heard that they are old acquaintances. Surely old acquaintances can talk together, and be interested in one another, without being in love. Why, very frequently of late Meriwether Clopton comes here. I hope you don\u0027t think I\u0027m in love with him.\" \"Certainly not, Lucy, most certainly not. But do you have Meriwether\u0027s portrait hanging in your parlour? And do you go and sit before it, and study it, and sometimes shake your finger at it playfully? I tell you, Lucy, there are some queer people in this world, and Ritta Claiborne is one of them.\" \"She is excellent company,\" said Mrs. Lumsden. \"She is, she is,\" Miss Polly assented. \"She is full of life and fun; she sees the ridiculous side of everything; and that is why I can\u0027t understand her fondness for old Silas. It is away beyond me. Why, Lucy, she treats that portrait as if it were alive. What she says to it, I can\u0027t tell you, for my hearing is not as good now as it was before my ears were affected. But she says something, for I can see her lips move, and I can see her smile. My eyesight is as good now as ever it was. I\u0027m telling you what I saw, not what I heard. The way she went on over that portrait was what first attracted my attention; but for that I would never have had a suspicion. Now, what do you think of it, Lucy?\" \"Nothing in particular. If it is true, it would be a good thing for Silas. He is not as mean as a great many people think he is.\" \"He may not be, Lucy,\" responded Miss Polly, \"but he brings a bad taste in my mouth every time I see him.\" \"Well, directly after Sherman passed through,\" said Mrs. Lumsden, \"and when few of us had anything left, Silas came to me, and asked if I needed anything, and he was ready to supply me with sufficient funds for my needs.\" \"Well, he didn\u0027t come to me,\" Miss Polly declared with emphasis, \"and if anybody in this world had needs, I did. You remember Robert Gaither? Well, Silas loaned him some money during the war, and although Robert was in a bad way, old Silas collected every cent down to the very last, and Robert had to go to Texas. Oh, I could tell you of numberless instances where he took advantage of those who had borrowed from him.\" \"I suppose that Mr. Lumsden had been kind to Silas when he was sowing his wild oats; indeed, I think my husband advanced him money when he had exhausted the supply allowed him by the executors of the Tomlin estate.\" \"And just think of it, Lucy—Ritta Claiborne sits there and plays the piano for old Silas, and sometimes Eugenia goes in and sings, and she has a beautiful voice; I\u0027m not too deaf to know that.\" It was then that Mrs. Lumsden leaned over and gave the ear-trumpet some very good advice. \"If I were in your place, Polly, I wouldn\u0027t tell this to any one else. Mrs. Claiborne is an excellent woman; she comes of a good family, and she is cultured and refined. No doubt she is sensitive, and if she heard that you were spreading your suspicions abroad, she would hardly feel like staying in a house where——\" Mrs. Lumsden paused. She had it on her tongue\u0027s-end to say, \"in a house where she is spied upon,\" but she had no desire in the world to offend that simple-minded old soul, who, behind all her peculiarities and afflictions, had a very tender heart. \"I know what you mean, Lucy,\" said Miss Polly, \"and your advice is good; but I can\u0027t help seeing what goes on under my eyes, and I thought there could be no harm in telling you about it. I am very fond of Ritta Claiborne, and as for Eugenia, why she is simply angelic. I love that child as well as if she were my own. If there\u0027s a flaw in her character, I have never found it. I\u0027ll say that much.\" The explanation of Miss Polly\u0027s suspicions is not as simple as her recital of them. No one can account for some of the impulses of the human heart, or the vagaries of the human mind. It is easy to say that after Silas Tomlin had his last interview with Mrs. Claiborne, he permitted his mind to dwell on her personality and surroundings, and so fell gradually under a spell. Such an explanation is not only easy to imagine, but it is plausible; nevertheless, it would not be true. There is a sort of tradition among the brethren who deal with character in fiction that it must be consistent with itself. This may be necessary in books, for it sweeps away at one stroke ten thousand mysteries and problems that play around the actions of every individual, no matter how high, no matter how humble. How often do we hear it remarked in real life that the actions of such and such an individual are a source of surprise and regret to his friends; and how often in our own experience have we been shocked by the unexpected as it crops out in the actions of our friends and acquaintances! For this and other reasons this chronicler does not propose to explain Silas\u0027s motives and movements and try to show that they are all consistent with his character, and that, therefore, they were all to be predicated from the beginning. What is certainly true is that Silas was one day stopped in the street by Eugenia, who inquired about Paul. He looked at the girl very gloomily at first, but when he began to talk about the troubles of his son, he thawed out considerably. In this case Eugenia\u0027s sympathies abounded, in fact were unlimited, and she listened with dewy eyes to everything Silas would tell her about Paul. \"You mustn\u0027t think too much about Paul,\" remarked Silas grimly, as they were about to part. \"Thank you, sir,\" replied Eugenia, with a smile, \"I\u0027ll think just enough and no more. But it was my mother that told me to ask about him if I saw you. She is very fond of him. You never come to see us now,\" the sly creature suggested. Silas stared at her before replying, and tried to find the gleam of mockery in her eyes, or in her smile. He failed, and his glances became shifty again. \"Why, I reckon she\u0027d kick me down the steps if I called without having some business with her. If you were to ask her who her worst enemy is, she\u0027d tell you that I am the man.\" \"Well, sir,\" replied Eugenia archly, \"I have been knowing mother a good many years, but I\u0027ve never seen her put any one out of the house yet. We were talking about you to-day, and she said you must be very lonely, now that Paul is away, and I know she sympathises with those who are lonely; I\u0027ve heard her say so many a time.\" \"Yes; that may be true,\" remarked Silas, \"but she has special reasons for not sympathising with me. She knows me a great deal better than you do.\" \"I\u0027m afraid you misjudge us both,\" said Eugenia demurely. \"If you knew us better, you\u0027d like us better. I\u0027m sure of that.\" \"Humph!\" grunted Silas. Then looking hard at the girl, he bluntly asked, \"Is there anything between you and Paul?\" \"A good many miles, sir, just now,\" she answered, making one of those retorts that Paul thought so fine. \"H-m-m; yes, you are right, a good many miles. Well, there can\u0027t be too many.\" \"I think you are cruel, sir. Is Paul not to come home any more? Paul is a very good friend of mine, and I could wish him well wherever he might be; but how would you feel, sir, if he were never to return?\" \"Well, I must go,\" said Silas somewhat bluntly. When Beauty has a glib tongue, abler men than Silas find themselves without weapons to cope with it. \"Shall I tell mother that you have given your promise to call soon?\" Eugenia asked. \"Now, I hope you are not making fun of me,\" cried Silas with some irritation. \"How could that be, sir? Don\u0027t you think it would be extremely pert in a young girl to make fun of a gentleman old enough to be her father?\" Silas winced at the comparison. \"Well, I have seen some very pert ones,\" he insisted, and with that he bade her good-day with a very ill grace, and went on about his business, of which he had a good deal of one kind and another. \"Mother,\" said Eugenia, after she had given an account of her encounter with Silas, \"I believe the man has a good heart and is ashamed of it.\" \"Why, I think the same may be said of most of the grand rascals that we read about in history; and the pity of it is that they would have all been good men if they had had the right kind of women to deal with them and direct their careers.\" \"Do you really think so, mother?\" the daughter inquired. \"I\u0027m sure of it,\" said the lady. Then after all there might be some hope for old Silas Tomlin. And his instinct may have given him an inkling of the remedy for his particular form of the whimsies, for it was not many days before he came knocking at the lady\u0027s door, where he was very graciously received, and most delightfully entertained. Both mother and daughter did their utmost to make the hours pass pleasantly, and they succeeded to some extent. For awhile Silas was suspicious, then he would resign himself to the temptations of good music and bright conversation. Presently he would remember his suspicions, and straighten himself up in his chair, and assume an attitude of defiance; and so the first evening passed. When Silas found himself in the street on his way home, he stopped still and reflected. \"Now, what in the ding-nation is that woman up to? What is she trying to do, I wonder? Why, she\u0027s as different from what she was when I first knew her as a butterfly is from a caterpillar. Why, there ain\u0027t a pearter woman on the continent. No wonder Paul lost his head in that house! She\u0027s up to something, and I\u0027ll find out what it is.\" Silas was always suspicious, but on this occasion he bethought himself of the fact that he had not been dragged into the house; he had been under no compulsion to knock at the door; indeed, he had taken advantage of the slightest hint on the part of the daughter—a hint that may have been a mere form of politeness. He remembered, too, that he had frequently gone by the house at night, and had heard the piano going, accompanied by the singing of one or the other of the ladies. His reflections would have made him ashamed of himself, but he had never cultivated such feelings. He left that sort of thing to the women and children. In no long time he repeated his visit, and met with the same pleasurable experience. On this occasion, Eugenia remained in the parlour only a short time. For a diversion, the mother played a few of the old-time tunes on the piano, and sang some of the songs that Silas had loved in his youth. This done, she wheeled around on the stool, and began to talk about Paul. \"If I had a son like that,\" she said, \"I should be immensely proud of him.\" \"You have a fine daughter,\" Silas suggested, by way of consolation. She shrugged her shoulders. \"Yes, but you know we always want that which we have not. Yet they say that envy is among the mortal sins.\" \"Well, a sin\u0027s a sin, I reckon,\" remarked Silas. \"Oh, no! there are degrees in sin. I used to know a preacher who could run the scale of evil-doing and thinking, just as I can trip along the notes on the piano.\" \"They once tried to make a preacher out of me,\" remarked Silas, \"but when I slipped in the church one day and went up into the pulpit, I found it was a great deal too big for me.\" \"They make them larger now,\" said the lady, \"so that they will hold the exhorter and the horrible example at the same time.\" \"Did Paul ever see my picture there?\" asked Silas, changing the conversation into a more congenial channel. \"Why, I think so,\" replied the lady placidly. \"I think he asked about it, and I told him that we had known each other long ago, which was not at all the truth.\" \"What did Paul say to that?\" asked Silas eagerly. \"He said that while some people might think you were queer, you had been a good dad to him. I think he said dad, but I\u0027ll not be sure.\" \"Yes, yes, he said it,\" cried Silas, all in a glow. \"That\u0027s Paul all over; but what will the poor boy think when he finds out what you know?\" \"Why, he\u0027ll enjoy the situation,\" said the lady, laughing. \"As you Georgians say, he\u0027ll be tickled to death.\" Silas regarded her with astonishment, his hands clenched and his thin lips pressed together. \"Do you think, Madam, that it is a matter for a joke? You women——\" \"Can\u0027t I have my own views? You have yours, and I make no objection.\" \"But think of what a serious matter it is to me. Do you realise that there is nothing but a whim betwixt me and disgrace—betwixt Paul and disgrace?\" \"A whim? Why, you are another Daniel O\u0027Connell! Call me a hyperbole, a rectangled triangle, a parenthesis, or a hyphen.\" She was laughing, and yet it was plain to be seen that she had no relish for the term which Silas had unintentionally applied to her. \"I meant to say that if the notion seized you, you would fetch us down as a hunter bags a brace of doves.\" \"Doves!\" exclaimed Mrs. Claiborne, with a comical lift of the eyebrows. \"Buzzards, then!\" said Silas with some heat. \"Oh, you overdo everything,\" laughed the lady. \"Well, there\u0027s nobody hurt but me,\" was Silas\u0027s gruff reply. \"And Paul,\" suggested the lady, with a peculiar smile. \"Well, when I say Paul, I mean myself. I\u0027ve been called worse names than buzzard by people who were trying to walk off with my money. Oh, they didn\u0027t call me that to my face,\" said Silas, noticing a queer expression in the lady\u0027s eyes. \"And people who should have known better have hated me because I didn\u0027t fling my money away after I had saved it.\" \"Well, you needn\u0027t worry about that,\" Mrs. Claiborne remarked. \"You will have plenty of company in the money-grabbing business before long. I can see signs of it now, and every time I think of it I feel sorry for our young men, yes, and our young women, and the long generations that are to come after them. In the course of a very few years you will find your business to be more respectable than any of the professions. You remember how, before the war, we used to sneer at the Yankees for their money-making proclivities? Well, it won\u0027t be very long before we\u0027ll beat them at their own game; and then our politicians will thrive, for each and all of them will have their principles dictated by Shylock and his partners.\" \"Why, you talk as if you were a politician yourself. But why are you sorry for our young women?\" \"That was a hasty remark. I am sorry for those who will grow weary and fall by the wayside. The majority of them, and the best of them, will make themselves useful in thousands of ways, and new industries will spring up for their benefit. They will become workers, and, being workers, they will be independent of the men, and finally begin to look down on them as they should.\" \"Well!\" exclaimed Silas, and then he sat and gazed at the lady for the first time with admiration. \"Where\u0027d you learn all that?\" he asked after awhile. \"Oh, I read the newspapers, and such books as I can lay my hands on, and I remember what I read. Didn\u0027t you notice that I recited my piece much as a school-boy would?\" \"No, I didn\u0027t,\" replied Silas. \"I do a good deal of reading myself, but all those ideas are new to me.\" \"Well, they\u0027ll be familiar to you just as soon as our people can look around and get their bearings. As for me, I propose to become an advanced woman, and go on the stage; there\u0027s nothing like being the first in the field. I always told my husband that if he died and left me without money, I proposed to earn my own living.\" \"You told your husband that? When did you tell him?\" inquired Silas with some eagerness. \"Oh, long before he died,\" replied the lady. Silas sat like one stunned. \"Do you mean to tell me that your husband is dead?\" \"Why, certainly,\" replied Mrs. Claiborne. \"What possible reason could I have for denying or concealing the fact?\" Silas straightened himself in his chair, and frowned. \"Then why did you come here and pretend—pretend—ain\u0027t you Ritta Rozelle, that used to be?\" \"There were two of them,\" the lady replied. \"They were twins. One was named Clarita, and the other Floretta, but both were called Ritta by those who could not distinguish them apart. I had reason to believe that you hadn\u0027t treated my sister as you should have done, and I came here to see if you would take the bait. You snapped it up before the line touched the water. It was not even necessary for me to try to deceive you. You simply shut your eyes and declared that I was your wife and that I had come.\" \"You are the sister who was going to school in—wasn\u0027t it Boston?\" \"Yes; that is why I am broad-minded and free from guile,\" remarked the lady with a laugh so merry that it irritated Silas. \"Then you have never been married to me,\" Silas suggested, still frowning. \"I thank you kindly, sir, I never have been.\" \"Well, you never denied it,\" he said. \"You never gave me an opportunity,\" she retorted. \"You simply sat back, and watched me make a fool of myself.\" \"You express it very well.\" Silas squirmed on his chair. \"Why, you knew me the minute you saw me!\" he cried. \"Therefore you are still sure I am the woman you married in Louisiana. Well, the man who was driving the hack the day of my arrival, saw you in the fields, and he made a remark I have never forgotten. He said—she mimicked Mr. Goodlett as well as she could—\u0027Well, dang my hide! ef thar ain\u0027t old Silas Tomlin out huntin\u0027! Ef he shoots an\u0027 misses he\u0027ll pull all his ha\u0027r out.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Bekaze he can\u0027t afford to waste a load of powder an\u0027 shot.\u0027\" Silas tried to smile. He knew that the point of Mr. Goodlett\u0027s joke was lost on the lady. Silas tried to smile, but the effort was too much for him, and he frowned instead. \"You did all you could to humour my mistake,\" he declared. \"I certainly did,\" said Mrs. Claiborne, very seriously. \"I had good reason to believe that your treatment of my sister was not what it should have been.\" \"Good Lord! she wouldn\u0027t let me treat her well. Why, we hadn\u0027t been married three months before she took a dislike to me, and she never got over it. The truth is, she couldn\u0027t bear the sight of me. I did what any other young man would have done. I packed up my things and came back home. I told Dorrington about it when I came back, and he said the trouble was a form of hysterics that finally develops into insanity.\" \"Yes, that was what happened to my poor sister,\" said Mrs. Claiborne, \"and I never knew the facts until a few months ago. Our aunt, you know, always contended that you were the cause of it all. But Judge Vardeman, quite by accident, met the physician who had charge of the case, and I have a letter from him which clearly explains the whole matter.\" Silas Tomlin sat silent for a long time, his gaze fixed on the floor. \"Well, well! here I have been going on for years under the impression that I was partly responsible for that poor girl\u0027s troubles; and it has been a nightmare riding me every minute that I had time to think.\" He stood up, stretched his arms above his head, and drew a long breath. \"I thank you for laying my ghost, and I\u0027ll bid you good-night.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77517.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
