{"id":23575,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER THREE The Return of Two Warriors","content":"When the great contest began, Nan was close to thirteen, and Gabriel was fourteen. Cephas was younger; he had lived hardly as many months as he had freckles on his face, otherwise he would have been an aged citizen. They wandered about together, always accompanied by Tasma Tid, all of them being children in every sense of the word. Occasionally they were joined by some of the other boys and girls; but they were always happier when they were left to themselves. In the late afternoons they could always be found in the Bermuda fields, but at other times, especially on a warm day, their favourite playground was under the wide-spreading elms in front of the post-office. Amusing themselves there in the fine weather, they could see the people come and go, many of them looking for letters that never came. When the conflict at the front became warm and serious, and when the very newspapers, as Mrs. Absalom said, smelt of blood, there was always a large crowd of men, old and young, gathered at the post-office when the mail-coach came from Malvern. As few of the people subscribed for a daily newspaper, Judge Odom (he was Judge of the Inferior Court, now called the Court of Ordinary) took upon himself to mount a chair or a dry-goods box, and read aloud the despatches printed in the Malvern Recorder. This enterprising journal had a number of volunteer correspondents at the front who made it a point to send with their letters the lists of the killed and wounded in the various Georgia regiments; and these lists grew ominously long as the days went by. And then, in the course of time, came the collapse of the Confederacy, an event that blew away with a breath, as it were, the hopes and dreams of those who had undertaken to build a new government in the South; and this march of time brought about a gradual change in the relations between Nan and Gabriel. It was almost as imperceptible in its growth as the movement of the shadow on the sun-dial. Somehow, and to her great disgust, Nan awoke one morning and was told that she was a young woman, or dreamt that she was told. Anyhow, she realised, all of a sudden, that she was now too tall for short dresses, and too old to be playing with the boys as if she were one of them; and the consciousness of this change gave her many a bad quarter of an hour, and sometimes made her a trifle irritable; for, sweet as she was, she had a temper. She asked herself a thousand times why she should now begin to feel shy of Gabriel, and why she should be so self-conscious, she who had never thought of herself with any degree of seriousness until now. It was all a puzzle to her. As it was with Nan, so it was with Gabriel. As Nan grew shy and shyer, so the newly-awakened Gabriel grew more and more and more timid, and the two soon found themselves very far apart without knowing why. For a long time Cephas was the only connecting link between them. He was a sly little rascal, this same Cephas, and he found in the situation food for both curiosity and amusement. He had not the least notion why the two friends and comrades were inclined to avoid each other. He only knew that he was not having as pleasant a time as fell to his portion when they were all going about together with no serious notions of life or conduct. Cephas got no satisfaction from either Nan or Gabriel when he asked them what the trouble was. Nan tried to explain matters, but her explanation was a very lame one. \"I am getting old enough to be serious, Cephas; and I must begin to make myself useful. That\u0027s what Miss Polly Gaither says, and she\u0027s old enough to know. Oh, I hate it all!\" said Nan. \"Is Miss Polly Gaither useful?\" inquired Cephas. \"I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know,\" replied Nan; \"but that\u0027s what she told me, and then she held up her ear-trumpet for me to talk in it; but I just couldn\u0027t, she looked so very much in earnest. It was all I could do to keep from laughing. Did you ever notice, Cephas, how funny people are when they are really in earnest?\" Alas! Cephas had often pinched himself in Sunday-school to keep from laughing at old Mrs. Crafton, his teacher. She was so dreadfully in earnest that she kept her face in a pucker the whole time. Outside of the Sunday-school she was a very pleasant old lady. Gabriel had no explanation to make whatever. He simply told Cephas that Nan was becoming vain. This Cephas denied with great emphasis, but Gabriel only shook his head and looked wise, as much as to say that he knew what he knew, and would continue to know it for some time to come. The truth is, however, that Gabriel was as ignorant of the feminine nature as it is possible for a young fellow to be; whereas, Nan, by means of the instinct or intuition which heaven has conferred on her sex for their protection, knew Gabriel a great deal better than she knew herself. When the war came to a close, Gabriel was nearly eighteen, and Nan was seventeen, though she appeared to be a year or two younger. She was still childish in her ways and tastes, and carried with her an atmosphere of simplicity and sweetness in which very few girls of her age are fortunate enough to move. Simplicity was a part of her nature, though some of her young lady friends used to whisper to one another that it was all assumed. She was even referred to as Miss Prissy, a term that was probably intended to be an abbreviation of Priscilla. Regularly, she used to hunt Cephas up and carry him home with her for the afternoon; and on the other hand, Gabriel manifested a great fondness for the little fellow, who enjoyed his enviable popularity with a clear conscience. It was years and years afterwards before the secret of his popularity dawned on him. If he had suspected it at the time, his pride, such as he had, would have had a terrible fall. One day, it was the year of Appomattox, and the month was June, Cephas heard his name called, and answered very promptly, for the voice was the voice of Gabriel, and it was burdened with an invitation to visit the woods and fields that surrounded the town. The weather itself was burdened with the same invitation. The birds sang it, and it rustled in the leaves of the trees. And Cephas leaped from the house, glad of any excuse to escape from the domestic task at which he had been set. They wandered forth, and became a part and parcel of the wild things. The hermit thrush, with his silver bell, was their brother, and the cat-bird, distressed for the safety of her young, was their sister. Yea, and the gray squirrel was their playmate, a shy one, it is true, but none the less a genuine one for all that. They roamed about the green-wood, and over the hills and fields, and finally found themselves in the public highway that leads to Malvern. Cephas found a cornstalk, and with hardly an effort of his mind, changed it into a fine saddle-horse. The contagion seized Gabriel, and though he was close upon his eighteenth birthday, he secured a cornstalk, which at once became a saddle-horse at his bidding. The magical powers of youth are wonderful, and for a little while the cornstalk horses were as real as any horses could be. The steed that Cephas bestrode was comparatively gentle, but Gabriel\u0027s horse developed a desire to take fright at everything he saw. A creature more skittish and nervous was never seen, and his example was soon followed by the steed that Cephas rode. The two boys were so busily engaged in trying to control their perverse horses, that they failed to see a big covered waggon that came creeping up the hill behind them. So, while they were cutting up their queer capers, the big waggon, drawn by two large mules, was plumb upon them. As for Cephas, he didn\u0027t care, being at an age when such capers are permissible, but Gabriel blushed when he discovered that his childish pranks had witnesses; and he turned a shade redder when he saw that the occupants of the waggon were, of all the persons in the world, Mr. Billy Sanders and Francis Bethune. Both of the boys would have passed on but for the compelling voice of Mr. Sanders. \"Why, it\u0027s little Gabe, and he\u0027s little Gabe no longer. And Cephas ain\u0027t growed a mite. Hello, Gabe! Hello, Cephas! Howdy, howdy?\" Francis Bethune\u0027s salutation was somewhat constrained, or if that be too large a word, was lacking in cordiality. \"What is the matter with Gabriel?\" he asked. \"It\u0027s a thousand pities, Frank,\" remarked Mr. Sanders, \"that Sarah Clopton wouldn\u0027t let you be a boy along with the other boys; but she coddled you up jest like you was a gal. Be jigged ef I don\u0027t believe you\u0027ve got on pantalettes right now.\" Bethune blushed hotly, while Gabriel and Cephas fairly yelled with laughter—and there was a little resentment in Gabriel\u0027s mirth. \"But I don\u0027t see what could possess Tolliver,\" Bethune insisted. \"Shucks, Frank! you wouldn\u0027t know ef he was to write it down for you, an\u0027 Nan Dorrin\u0027ton would know wi\u0027out any tellin\u0027. You ain\u0027t a bit brighter about sech matters than you was the day Nan give you a thumpin\u0027.\" At this Gabriel laughed again, for he had been an eye-witness to the episode to which Mr. Sanders referred. A boy has his prejudices, as older persons have theirs. Bethune had always had the appearance of being too fond of himself; when other boys of his age were playing and pranking, he would be primping, and in the afternoon, before he went off to the war, he would strut around town in the uniform of a cadet, and seemed to think himself better than any one else. These things count with boys as much as they do with older persons. \"Climb in the waggin, Gabe an\u0027 Cephas, an\u0027 tell us about ever\u0027thing an\u0027 ever\u0027body. The Yanks didn\u0027t take the town off, did they?\" The boys accepted the invitation without further pressing, for they were both fond of Mr. Sanders, and proceeded to give their old friend all the information he desired. Francis Bethune asked no questions, and Gabriel was very glad of it. At bottom, Bethune was a very clever fellow, but the boys are apt to make up their judgments from what is merely superficial. Francis had a very handsome face, and he could have made himself attractive to a youngster on the lookout for friends, but he had chosen a different line of conduct, and as a result, Gabriel had several scores against the young man. And so had Cephas; for, on one occasion, the latter had gone to the Clopton Place for some wine for his mother, who was something of an invalid, and, coming suddenly on Sarah Clopton, found her in tears. Cephas never had a greater shock than the sight gave him, for he had never connected this self-contained, gray-haired woman with any of the tenderer emotions. In the child\u0027s mind, she was simply a sort of superintendent of affairs on the Clopton Place, who, in the early mornings, stood on the back porch of the big house, and, in a voice loud enough to be heard a considerable distance, gave orders to the domestics, and allotted to the field hands their tasks for the day. Sarah Clopton must have seen how shocked the child was, for she dried her eyes and tried to laugh, saying, \"You never expected to see me crying, did you, little boy?\" Cephas had no answer for this, but when she asked if he could guess why she was crying, the child remembered what he had heard Nan and Gabriel say, and he gave an answer that was both prompt and blunt. \"I reckon Frank Bethune has been making a fool of himself again,\" said he. \"But how did you know, child?\" she asked, placing her soft white fingers under his chin, and lifting his face toward the light. \"You are a wise lad for your years,\" she said, when he made no reply, \"and I am sure you are sensible enough to do me a favour. Please say nothing about what you have seen. An old woman\u0027s tears amount to very little. And don\u0027t be too hard on Frank. He has simply been playing some college prank, and they are sending him home.\" The most interesting piece of news that Gabriel had in his budget related to the hanging of Mr. Absalom Goodlett by some of Sherman\u0027s men, when that commander came marching through Georgia. It seems that a negro had told the men that Mr. Goodlett knew where the Clopton silver had been concealed, and they took him in hand and tried to frighten him into giving them information which he did not possess. Threats failing, they secured a rope and strung him up to a tree. They strung him up three times, and the third time, they went off and left him hanging; and but for the promptness of the negro who was the cause of the trouble, and who had been an interested spectator of the proceedings, Mr. Goodlett would never have opened his eyes on the affairs of this world again. The negro cut him down in the nick of time, and as soon as he recovered, he sent the darkey with instructions to go after the men, and tell them where they could find the plate, indicating an isolated spot. Whereupon Mr. Goodlett took his gun, and went to the point indicated. The negro carried out his instructions to the letter. He found the men, who had not gone far, pointed out the spot from a safe distance, and then waited to see what would happen. If he saw anything unusual, he never told of it; but the men were never seen again. Some of their companions returned to search for them, but the search was a futile one. The negro went about with a frightened face for several days, and then he settled down to work for Mr. Goodlett, in whom he seemed to have a strange interest. He showed this in every way. \"You keep yo\u0027 eye on \u0027im,\" he used to say to his coloured acquaintances, in speaking of Mr. Goodlett; \"keep yo\u0027 eye on \u0027im, an\u0027 when you see his under-jaw stickin\u0027 out, des turn you\u0027 back, an\u0027 put yo\u0027 fingers in yo\u0027 ears.\" \"You never know,\" said Mr. Sanders, in commenting on the story, \"what a man will do ontell he gits rank pizen mad, or starvin\u0027 hongry, or in love.\" \"What would you do, Mr. Sanders, if you were in love?\" Gabriel asked innocently enough. \"Maybe I\u0027d do as Frank does,\" replied Mr. Sanders, smiling blandly; \"shed scaldin\u0027 tears one minnit, an\u0027 bite my finger-nails the next; maybe I would, but I don\u0027t believe it.\" \"Now, I\u0027ll swear you ought not to tell these boys such stuff as that!\" exclaimed Francis Bethune angrily. \"I don\u0027t know about Cephas, but Tolliver doesn\u0027t like me any way.\" \"How do you know?\" inquired Gabriel. \"Because you used to make faces at me,\" replied Bethune, half laughing. \"Why, so did Nan,\" Gabriel rejoined. \"Mine must have been terrible ones for you to remember them so well.\" The reference to Nan struck Bethune, and he began to gnaw at the end of his thumb, whereupon Mr. Sanders smiled broadly. The young man reflected a moment and then remarked, his face a trifle redder than usual; \"Isn\u0027t the young lady old enough for you to call her Miss Dorrington?\" \"She is,\" replied Gabriel; \"but if she permits me to call her Nan, why should any one else object?\" There was no answer to this, but presently Bethune turned to Gabriel and said: \"Why do you dislike me, Tolliver?\" For a little time the lad was silent; he was trying to formulate his prejudices into something substantial and sufficient, but the effort was a futile one. While he was silent, Bethune regarded him with a curious stare. \"Honestly,\" said Gabriel, \"I can give no reason; and I\u0027m not sure I dislike you. But you always held your head so high that I kept away from you. I had an idea that you felt yourself above me because my grandmother is not as rich as the Cloptons.\" The statement seemed to amaze Bethune. \"You couldn\u0027t have been more than ten or twelve when I left here for the war,\" he remarked. \"Yes, I was more than thirteen,\" Gabriel replied. \"Well, I never thought that a boy so young could have such thoughts,\" Bethune declared. \"Pooh!\" exclaimed Mr. Sanders; \"a fourteen-year-old boy can have some mighty deep thoughts, specially ef he\u0027 been brung up in a house full of books, as Gabriel was. I hope, Gabriel,\" he went on, \"that you\u0027ll stick to your cornstalk hoss as long as you want to. You\u0027ll live longer for it, an\u0027 your friends will love you jest the same. Frank here has never been a boy. Out of bib an\u0027 hippin, he jumped into long britches an\u0027 a standin\u0027 collar, an\u0027 the only fun he ever had in his life he got kicked out of college for, an\u0027 served him right, too. I\u0027ll bet you a thrip to a pint of pot-licker that Nan\u0027ll ride a stick hoss tomorrer ef she takes a notion—an\u0027 she\u0027s seventeen. Don\u0027t you forgit, Gabriel, that you\u0027ll never be a boy but once, an\u0027 you better make the most on it whilst you can.\" The waggon came just then to the brow of the hill that overlooked Shady Dale, and here Mr. Sanders brought his team to a standstill. It had been many long months since his eyes or Bethune\u0027s had gazed on the familiar scene. \"I\u0027ll tell you what\u0027s the fact, boys,\" he said, drawing in a long breath—\"the purtiest place this side of Paradise lies right yander before our eyes. Ef I had some un to give out the lines, I\u0027d cut loose and sing a hime. Yes, sirs! you\u0027d see me break out an\u0027 howl jest like my old coon dog, Louder, used to do when he struck a hot track. The Lord has picked us out of the crowd, Frank, an\u0027 holp us along at every turn an\u0027 crossin\u0027. But before the week\u0027s out, we\u0027ll forgit to be thankful. J\u0027inin\u0027 the church wouldn\u0027t do us a grain of good. By next Sunday week, Frank, you\u0027ll be struttin\u0027 around as proud as a turkey gobbler, an\u0027 you\u0027ll git wuss an\u0027 wuss less\u0027n Nan takes a notion for to frail you out ag\u0027in.\" Bethune relished the remark so little that he chirped to the mules, but Mr. Sanders seized the reins in his own hands. \"We\u0027ve fit an\u0027 we\u0027ve fout, an\u0027 we\u0027ve got knocked out,\" he went on, \"an\u0027 now, here we are ready for to take a fresh start. The Lord send that it\u0027s the right start.\" He would have driven on, but at that moment, a shabby looking vehicle drew up alongside the waggon. Gabriel and Cephas knew at once that the outfit belonged to Mr. Goodlett. His mismatched team consisted of a very large horse and a very small mule, both of them veterans of the war. They had been left by the Federals in a broken-down condition, and Mr. Goodlett found them grazing about, trying to pick up a living. He appropriated them, fed them well, and was now utilising them not only for farm purposes, but for conveying stray travellers to and from Malvern, earning in this way many a dollar that would have gone elsewhere. Mr. Goodlett drew rein when he saw Mr. Sanders and Francis Bethune, and gave them as cordial a greeting as he could, for he was a very undemonstrative and reticent man. At that time both Gabriel and Cephas thought he was both sour and surly, but, in the course of events, their opinions in regard to that and a great many other matters underwent a considerable change.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77490.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
