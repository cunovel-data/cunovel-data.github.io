{"id":23598,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX Cephas Has His Troubles","content":"Usually there is a yawning gulf between youth and old age; but in the case of Mrs. Lumsden and Nan Dorrington, it was spanned by the simplicity and tenderness common to both. Whether any of the ancients or moderns have mentioned the fact, it is hardly worth while to inquire, but good-humour is a form of tenderness. Those who are easy to laugh are likewise ready to be sorry, and they have a fund of sympathy to draw on whenever the necessity arises. Simplicity and tenderness connect the highest wisdom with the deepest ignorance, and find the elements of brotherhood where the intellect is unable to discern it. It was simplicity and tenderness that bridged the gulf of years that lay between the old gentlewoman and the young girl. Age can find no comfort for itself unless it can make terms with youth. Where it stands alone, depending upon the respect that should belong to what is venerable, there is something gruesome about it. It quenches the high spirits of children and young people, and chills their enthusiasm. All that it does for them is to give notorious advertisement to the complexion to which they must all come at last. \"You see these wrinkled and flabby features, this gray hair, these faded and watery eyes, these shaking limbs and trembling hands: well, this is what you must come to.\" And, indeed, it is an object lesson well calculated to sober and subdue the giddy. Now, age had dealt very gently with Gabriel\u0027s grandmother; it became her well. Her white hair was even more beautiful now than it had been when she was young, as Meriwether Clopton often declared. Her eyes were bright, and all her sympathies were as keenly alive as they had been fifty years before. She had kept in touch with Gabriel and the young people about her, and none of her faculties had been impaired. She was the gentlest of gentlewomen. Once Nan had asked her—\"Grandmother Lumsden, what is the perfume I smell every time I come here? You have it on your clothes.\" \"Life Everlasting, my dear.\" For one brief and fleeting instant, Nan had the odd feeling that she could see millions and millions of years into the future. Life Everlasting! She caught her breath. But the vision or feeling was swept away by the placid voice of Mrs. Lumsden. \"I believe you and Gabriel call it rabbit tobacco,\" she explained. Nan had a great longing to be with Mrs. Lumsden the moment she heard that Gabriel had been spirited away by the strong arm of the Government. She felt that she would be more comfortable there than at home. \"My dear, what put it into that wise little head of yours to come and comfort an old woman?\" Mrs. Lumsden asked, when Meriwether Clopton and Miss Fanny Tomlin had taken their departure. She was still sitting close to Nan, caressing her hand. \"I thought you would be lonely with Gabriel gone, and I just made up my mind to come. I was afraid until I reached the door, and then I wasn\u0027t afraid any more. If you don\u0027t want me, I\u0027ll soon find it out.\" \"I can\u0027t tell you how glad I am, Nan, to have you here; and I can guess your feelings. No doubt you were shocked to hear that Francis Bethune had been taken with the rest.\" The dear old lady had the knack of clinging to her ideas. \"I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know what you mean, Grandmother Lumsden. I care no more for Mr. Bethune than I do for the others—perhaps not so much.\" \"I don\u0027t know why it is,\" said Mrs. Lumsden, \"but I have always looked forward to the day when you and Francis would be married.\" \"I\u0027ve heard you talk that way before, and I\u0027ve often wondered why you did it.\" \"Oh, well! perhaps it is one of my foolish dreams,\" said Mrs. Lumsden with a sigh. \"Your father\u0027s plantation and that of Francis\u0027s grandfather are side by side, and I have thought it would be romantic for the heirs to join hands and make the two places one.\" \"I can\u0027t see anything romantic in that, Grandmother Lumsden. It\u0027s like a sum in arithmetic.\" \"Well, you must allow old people to indulge in their dreams, my dear. When you are as old as I am, and have seen as much of life, you will have different ideas about romance.\" \"I hope, ma\u0027am, that your next dream will be truer,\" said Nan, almost playfully. That night, Nan lay awake for a long time. At last she slipped out of bed, felt her way around it, and leaned over and kissed Gabriel\u0027s grandmother. In an instant she felt the motherly arms of the old gentlewoman around her. \"Is that the way you do, when Gabriel comes and kisses you in the night?\" whispered Nan wistfully. \"Yes, yes, my dear—many times.\" \"Oh, I am so glad!\" the words exhaled from the girl\u0027s lips in a long-drawn, trembling sigh. Then she went back to her place in bed, and soon both the comforter and the comforted were sound asleep. As has been hinted, the moment Mr. Sanders discovered there was some slight chance of getting a message to Gabriel, he became one of the busiest men in Shady Dale, though his industry was not immediately apparent to his friends and neighbours. Among those whom he took occasion to see was Mr. Tidwell, whose son Jesse was among the prisoners. \"Gus,\" said Mr. Sanders, without any ceremony, \"you remember the row you come mighty nigh havin\u0027 wi\u0027 Tomlin Perdue, not so many years ago?\" \"Yes; I remember something of it,\" replied Mr. Tidwell. He was a man who ordinarily went with his head held low, as though engaged in deep thought. When spoken to he straightened up, and thereby seemed to add several inches to his height. \"Well, it\u0027s got to be done over ag\u0027in,\" remarked Mr. Sanders. \"It happened in Malvern, didn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes, in the depot,\" replied Mr. Tidwell. \"We were both on our way to Atlanta, and the Major misunderstood something I had said.\" \"Egzackly! Well, it must be done over ag\u0027in.\" Mr. Tidwell lowered his head and appeared to reflect. Then he straightened up again, and his face was very serious. \"Mr. Sanders, has Tomlin Perdue been dropping his wing about that fuss? Has he been making remarks?\" \"Oh, I reckon not,\" replied Mr. Sanders cheerfully. \"But I\u0027ve got a mighty good reason for axin\u0027 you about it. Come in your office, Gus, an\u0027 I\u0027ll tell you all I know, an\u0027 it won\u0027t take me two minnits.\" They went in and closed the door, and remained in consultation for some time. While they were thus engaged, Silas Tomlin came to the door, tried the bolt, and finding that it would not yield, walked restlessly up and down, preyed upon by many strange and conflicting emotions. He had evidently gone through much mental suffering. His face was drawn and haggard, and his clothes were shabbier than ever. He took no account of time, but walked up and down, waiting for Mr. Tidwell to come out, and as he walked he was the victim both of his fears and his affections. One moment, he heartily wished that he might never see his son again; the next he would have given everything he possessed to have the boy back, and hear once more the familiar, \"Hello, father!\" After awhile, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Tidwell came forth from the lawyer\u0027s office. They appeared to be in fine humour, for both were laughing, as though some side-splitting joke had just passed between them. \"There\u0027s no doubt about it, Mr. Sanders,\" Lawyer Tidwell was saying, \"you ought to be a major-general!\" \"I declare, Tidwell!\" exclaimed Silas, with something like indignation, \"I don\u0027t see how you can go around happy and laughing under the circumstances. You do like you could fetch your son back with a laugh. I wish I could fetch Paul back that way.\" \"Well, he\u0027d stay whar he is, Silas,\" said Mr. Sanders, with a benevolent smile, \"ef his comin\u0027 back had to be brung about by any hilarity from you. Why, you ain\u0027t laughed but once sence you was a baby, an\u0027 when you heard the sound of it you set up a howl that\u0027s lasted ever sence.\" \"If you think, Silas, that crying will bring the boys back,\" said Mr. Tidwell, \"I\u0027ll join you in a crying-match, and stand here and boohoo with you just as long as you want to.\" \"I just called by to see if you had heard any news,\" remarked Silas, taking no offence at the sarcastic utterances of the two men. \"I am just obliged to get some news. I am on pins: I can\u0027t sleep at night; and my appetite is gone.\" Mr. Sanders looked at the man\u0027s haggard face, and immediately became serious and sympathetic. \"Well, I tell you, Silas, you needn\u0027t worry another minnit. The only one amongst \u0027em that\u0027s in real trouble is Gabriel Tolliver. I\u0027ve looked into the case from A to Izzard, an\u0027 that\u0027s the way it stan\u0027s.\" \"That is perfectly true,\" assented Mr. Tidwell. \"We can account for the movements of all the boys on the night of the killing except those of Tolliver; and he is in considerable danger. By the way, Silas, you said some time ago—oh, ever so long ago—that you would bring me a copy of Blackwood\u0027s Magazine. You remember there was a story in it you wanted me to read.\" \"No, I—well, I tried to find it; I hunted for it high and low; but I haven\u0027t been able to put my hands on it. But I\u0027ve had so much trouble of one kind and another, that I clean forgot it. I\u0027m glad you mentioned it; I\u0027ll try to find it again.\" \"Well, as a lawyer,\" said Mr. Tidwell, somewhat significantly—or so it seemed to Silas—\"I don\u0027t charge you a cent for telling you that your case wouldn\u0027t stand a minnit.\" \"My case—my case! What case? I have no case. Why, I don\u0027t know what you are talking about.\" He shook his head and waved his hand nervously. \"Oh, I remember now; your case was purely hypothetical,\" said Mr. Tidwell. \"Well, your Blackwood was wrong about it.\" \"That\u0027s what I thought,\" Silas assented with a grunt; and with that, he turned abruptly away, and went in the direction of his house. \"I\u0027ll tell you what\u0027s the fact,\" remarked Mr. Sanders, as he watched the shabby and shrunken figure retreat; \"I\u0027m about to change my mind about Silas. I used to think he was mean all through; but he\u0027s got a nice warm place in his heart for that son of his\u0027n. I declare I feel right sorry for the man.\" Before Cephas went away, he was not too busy learning the lessons Mr. Sanders had set for him to forget to hunt up Nan Dorrington and tell her the wonderful news; to-wit, that he was about to go on a journey, and that while he was gone he would most likely see Gabriel. \"Well,\" said Nan, drawing herself up a little stiffly, \"what is that to me?\" Unfortunately, Cephas had come upon the girl when she was talking with Eugenia Claiborne, who had sought her out at the Lumsden Place. Cephas looked at her hard a moment, and then his freckled face turned red. He was properly angry. \"Well, whatever it may be to you, it\u0027s a heap to me,\" he said. \"I hope it\u0027s nothing to you.\" \"Cephas, will you see Paul Tomlin?\" asked Eugenia. \"If you do, tell him that one of his friends sent him her love.\" \"Is it sure enough love?\" inquired Cephas. \"Yes, Cephas, it is,\" replied Eugenia simply and seriously—but her face was very red. \"Tell him that Eugenia Claiborne sent him her love.\" \"All right,\" said Cephas, and turned away without looking at Nan. She had hurt his feelings. This turn of affairs didn\u0027t suit Nan at all. She ran after Cephas, and caught him by the arm. \"Aren\u0027t you ashamed of yourself, Cephas, to treat me so? How could I tell you anything before others? If you see Gabriel, tell him—oh, I don\u0027t know what to say. If I was to tell you what I want to, you\u0027d say that Nan Dorrington had lost her mind. No, I\u0027ll not send any word, Cephas. It wouldn\u0027t be proper in a young lady. If he asks about me, just tell him that I am well and happy.\" She turned away, in response to a call from Eugenia Claiborne, but she kept her eyes on Cephas for some time. Evidently she wished to send a message, but was afraid to. \"Don\u0027t be angry with me, Cephas,\" she said, before the youngster got out of hearing. Cephas made no reply, but trudged on stolidly. He was at the age when a boy is easily disgusted with girls and young women. You may call them sweet creatures if you want to, but a twelve-year-old boy is not to be deceived by fine words. The sweet creatures are under no restraints when dealing with small boys, and the small boys are well acquainted with all their worst traits. What is most strange is that this intimate knowledge is of no service to them when they grow a little older. They forget all about it and fall into the first trap that love sets for them. Cephas was angry without knowing why. He felt that both Gabriel and himself had been insulted, though he couldn\u0027t have explained the nature of the insult; and he was all the angrier because he was fond of Nan. She had been very kind to the little boy—kinder, perhaps, than he deserved, for he had made the impulsive young lady the victim of many a practical joke. As Cephas went along, it suddenly occurred to him that he had done wrong to say anything about his proposed journey, and the thought took away all his resentment. He whirled in his tracks, and ran back to where he had left the girls. He saw Eugenia Claiborne sauntering along the street, but Nan was nowhere in sight. He had no trouble in pledging Miss Claiborne to secrecy, for she was very fond of all sorts of secrets, and could keep them as well as another girl. Nan, she informed Cephas, had expressed a determination to visit him at his own home, and, in fact, Cephas found her there. She was as sweet as sugar, and was not at all the same Nan who had drawn herself up proudly and as good as told Cephas that it was nothing to her that he was going to see Gabriel. No; this was another Nan, and she had a troubled look in her eyes that Cephas had never seen there before. \"I came to see if you were still angry, Cephas,\" she said by way of explanation. \"I wasn\u0027t very nice to you, was I?\" \"Well, I hope you don\u0027t mind Cephas,\" said the lad\u0027s mother. \"If you do, he\u0027ll keep you guessing. Has he been rude to you, Nan?\" And it was then that Cephas heard praise poured on his name in a steady stream. Cephas rude! Cephas saucy! A thousand times no! Why, he was the best, the kindest, and the brightest child in the town. Nan was so much in earnest that Cephas had to blush. \"I didn\u0027t know,\" said his mother. \"He has been going with those large boys so much that I was afraid he was getting too big for his breeches.\" She loved her son, but she had no illusions about the nature of boys; she knew them well. \"Are you still angry, Cephas?\" Nan asked. She appeared very anxious to be sure on that score. \"N-o-o,\" replied Cephas, somewhat doubtfully; he hesitated to surrender the advantage that he saw he had. \"Yes, you are,\" said Nan, \"and I think it is very unkind of you. I am sorry you misunderstood me; if you only knew how I really feel, and how much trouble I have, you would be sorry instead of angry.\" \"I\u0027m the one to blame,\" said Cephas penitently. \"Gabriel says you dislike him, and I thought he was only guessing. But he knew better than I did. I had no business to bother you.\" Nan caught her breath. \"Did Gabriel say I disliked him?\" \"He didn\u0027t say that word,\" replied Cephas. \"I think he said you detested him, and I told him he didn\u0027t know what he was talking about. But he did; he knew a great deal better than I did, because I didn\u0027t really know until just now.\" \"But, Cephas!\" cried Nan; \"what could have put such an idea in his head?\" Cephas\u0027s mother was now busy about the house. \"I didn\u0027t know then, but I know now,\" remarked the boy stolidly. \"Don\u0027t be unkind, Cephas. If you knew me better, you\u0027d be sorry for me. You and Gabriel are terribly mistaken. I\u0027m very fond of both of you.\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t count in this game,\" Cephas declared. \"Oh, yes, you do,\" said Nan. \"You are one of my dearest friends, and so is Gabriel.\" \"All right,\" said Cephas. \"If you treat all your dearest friends as you do Gabriel, I\u0027m very sorry for them.\" \"Cephas, if you tell Gabriel what I said while Eugenia Claiborne was standing there, all ears, I\u0027ll never forgive you.\" Nan was at her wit\u0027s end. \"Tell him that!\" cried Cephas; \"why, I wouldn\u0027t tell him that, not for all the world. I\u0027ll tell him nothing.\" \"Please, Cephas,\" said Nan. \"Tell him\"—she paused, and threw her hair away from her pale face—\"tell him that if he doesn\u0027t come home soon, I shall die!\" Then her face turned from pale to red, and she laughed loudly. \"Well, I certainly sha\u0027n\u0027t tell him that,\" said Cephas. \"I didn\u0027t think you would,\" said Nan. \"You are a nice little boy, and I am going to kiss you good-bye. If you don\u0027t have something sweet to tell me when you come back, I\u0027ll think you detest me—wasn\u0027t that Gabriel\u0027s word? Poor Gabriel! he\u0027s in prison, and here we are joking about him.\" \"I\u0027m not joking about him!\" exclaimed Cephas. \"Just as much as I am,\" said Nan; and then she leaned over and kissed Cephas\u0027s freckled face, leaving it very red after the operation. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77513.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
