{"id":23600,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT Nan and Margaret","content":"It was hinted in some of the early chapters of this chronicle that none of the characters would turn out to be very heroic, but this was a mistake. The chronicler had forgotten a few episodes that grew out of the expedition of Cephas to Fort Pulaski—episodes that should have stood out clear in his memory from the first. Cephas was very meek and humble when he started on his expedition, so much so that there were long moments when he would have given a large fortune, if he had possessed it, to be safe at home with his mother. A hundred times he asked himself why he had been foolish enough to come away from home, and trust himself to the cold mercy of the world; and he promised himself faithfully that if he ever got back home alive, he would never leave there again. Captain Falconer was very kind and attentive to the lad, but he was also very inquisitive. He asked Cephas a great many artful questions, all leading up to the message he was to deliver to Gabriel; but the instructions he had received from Mr. Sanders made Cephas more than a match for the Captain. When the lad came to the years of maturity, he often wondered how a plain and comparatively ignorant countryman could foresee the questions that were to be asked, and provide simple and satisfactory answers to them; and the matter is still a mystery. Well, Cephas was not a hero when he started, and if the truth is to be told, he developed none of the symptoms until he had returned home safely, accompanied by Mr. Sanders. Then he became the lion of the village, and was sought after by old and young. All wanted to hear the story of his wonderful adventures. He speedily became a celebrated Cephas, and when he found that he was really regarded as a hero by his schoolmates, and by some of the young women, he was quick to appropriate the character. He became reticent; he went about with a sort of weary and travel-worn look, as if he had seen everything that was worth seeing, and heard everything that was worth hearing. Now, what Cephas had seen and heard was bad enough. He could hardly be brought to believe that the haggard and wild-eyed young fellow who answered to Gabriel\u0027s name at the fort was the Gabriel that he had known, and when he made up his mind that it really was Gabriel, he couldn\u0027t hold the tears back. \"Brace up, old man,\" said Gabriel. It was then in a choking voice that Cephas delivered Mr. Sanders\u0027s message, using the dog-latin which they both knew so well. And in that tongue Gabriel told Cephas of the tortures to which he and his fellow-prisoners had been subjected, of the horrors of the sweat-boxes, and the terrors of the wrist-rack. So effective was the narrative that Gabriel rattled off in the school tongue, that when he was ordered back to his solitary cell, Cephas turned away weeping. He was no hero then; he was simply a small boy with a tender heart. There were grave faces at Shady Dale when Cephas told what he had seen and heard. Major Tomlin Perdue, of Halcyondale, became almost savage when he heard of the indignities to which the unfortunate young men had been subjected. He wrote a card and published it in the Malvern Recorder, and the card was so much to the purpose, and created such indignation in the State, that the authorities at Washington took cognisance thereof, and issued orders that there was to be no more torture of the prisoners. This fact, however, was not known until months afterward, and, meanwhile, the newspapers of Georgia were giving a wide publicity to the cruelties which had been practised on the young men, and radicalism became the synonym of everything that was loathsome and detestable. Reprisals were made in all parts of the State, and as was to be expected, the negroes were compelled to bear the brunt of all the excitement and indignation. The tale that Cephas told to Mr. Sanders was modest when compared to the inventions that occurred to his mind after he found how easy it was to be a hero. Though he pretended to be heartily tired of the whole subject, there was nothing that tickled him more than to be cornered by a crowd of his schoolmates and comrades, all intent on hearing anew the awful recital which Cephas had prepared after his return. One of the first to seek Cephas out was Nan Dorrington, and this was precisely what the young hero wanted. He was very cold and indifferent when Nan besought him to tell her all about his trip. How did he enjoy himself? and didn\u0027t he wish he was back at home many a time? And what did Paul and Jesse have to say? Ah, Cephas had his innings now! \"I didn\u0027t see Paul and Jesse,\" replied Cephas, \"and I didn\u0027t see Francis Bethune.\" \"Did they have them hid?\" asked Nan. \"I don\u0027t know. The one I saw was in a black dungeon. I couldn\u0027t hardly see his face, and when I did see it, I was sorry I saw it.\" Cephas leaned back against the fence with the air of a fellow who has seen too much. Nan was dying to ask a hundred questions about the one Cephas had seen, but she resented his indifferent and placid attitude. All heroes are placid and indifferent when they discuss their deeds, but they wouldn\u0027t be if the public in general felt toward them as Nan felt toward Cephas. The only reason she didn\u0027t seize the little fellow and give him a good shaking was the fact that she was dying to hear all he had to say about his visit, and all about Gabriel. Gradually Cephas thawed out. One or the other had to surrender, and the small boy had no such incentive to silence as Nan had. His pride was not involved, whereas Nan would have gone to the rack and suffered herself to be pulled to pieces before she would have asked any direct questions about Gabriel. \"I\u0027m mighty sorry I went,\" said Cephas finally, and then he stopped short. \"Why?\" inquired Nan. \"Oh, well—I don\u0027t know exactly. I thought I would find everybody just like they were before they went away, but the one I saw looked like a drove of mules had trompled on him. He didn\u0027t have on any coat, and his shirt was torn and dirty, and his face looked like he had been sick a month. His eyes were hollow, and had black circles around them.\" \"Did he say anything?\" asked Nan in a low tone. \"Yes, he said, \u0027Brace up, old man.\u0027\" \"Was that all?\" \"And then he asked if anybody had sent him any word, and I said, \u0027Nobody but Mr. Sanders\u0027; and then he said, \u0027I might have known that he wouldn\u0027t forget me.\u0027\" Cephas could see Nan crushing her handkerchief in her hand, and he enjoyed it immensely. \"Was he angry with any one?\" Nan asked. \"Why, when did anybody ever hear of his being angry with any one he thought was a friend?\" exclaimed Cephas scornfully. Nan writhed at this, and Cephas went on. \"He had been tied up by the wrists, and then he had been put in a sweat-box, and nearly roasted—yes, by grabs! pretty nigh cooked.\" \"Why, you didn\u0027t tell his grandmother that,\" said Nan. \"Well, I should say not!\" exclaimed Cephas. \"What do you take me for? Do you reckon I\u0027d tell that to anybody that cared anything for him? Why, I wouldn\u0027t tell his grandmother that for anything in the world, and if she was to ask me about it, I\u0027d deny it.\" This arrow went home. Cephas had the unmixed pleasure of seeing Nan turn pale. \"I think you are simply awful,\" she gasped. \"You are cruel, and you are unkind. You know very well that I care something for Gabriel. Haven\u0027t we been friends since we were children together? Do you suppose I have no feelings?\" \"I know what you said when I told you I was going to see Gabriel.\" \"What was that?\" inquired Nan. \"Why, you said, \u0027Well, what is that to me?\u0027\" exclaimed Cephas. He twisted his face awry, and mimicked Nan\u0027s voice with considerable success, only he made it more spiteful than that charming young woman could have done. \"Yes, I did say that, but didn\u0027t I go to your house, and tell you what to say to Gabriel?\" Cephas laughed scornfully. \"Did you think I was going to swallow the joke that you and that Claiborne girl hatched up between you? Do you reckon I\u0027m fool enough to tell Gabriel that you\u0027ll die if he don\u0027t come home soon?\" \"You didn\u0027t tell him, then?\" \"No, I didn\u0027t,\" replied Cephas. \"I would cut off one of my fingers before I\u0027d let him know that there were people here at home making fun of him.\" Nan gazed at Cephas as if she suspected him of a joke. But she saw that he was very much in earnest. \"I\u0027m glad you didn\u0027t tell him,\" she said finally. Then she laughed, saying, \"Cephas, I really did think you had a little sense.\" \"I have sense enough not to hurt the feelings of them that like me,\" the boy replied. And he went on his way, trying to reconcile the Nan Dorrington who used to be so kind to him with the Nan Dorrington who was flirting and flitting around with long skirts on. He failed, as older and more experienced persons have failed. But you may be sure that he felt himself no less a hero because Nan Dorrington had hinted that he had no sense. He knew where the lack of sense was. After awhile, when interested persons ceased to run after him to get all the particulars of his visit to Fort Pulaski, he threw himself in their way, and when the details of his journey began to pall on the appetite of his friends, he invented new ones, and in this way managed to keep the centre of the stage for some time. When he could no longer interest the older folk, he had the school-children to fall back upon, and you may believe that he caused the youngsters to sit with open-mouthed wonder at the tales he told. The fact that he stammered a little, and sometimes hesitated for a word, made not the slightest difference with his audience of young people. There was one fact that bothered Cephas. He had been told that Francis Bethune was in love with Margaret Gaither, and he knew that the young man was a constant caller at Neighbour Tomlin\u0027s, where Margaret lived. Indeed, he had carried notes to her from the young man, and had faithfully delivered the replies. He judged, therefore, as well as a small boy can judge, that there was some sort of an understanding between the two, and he itched for the opportunity to pour the tale of his adventures into Margaret\u0027s ears. He loitered around the house, and threw himself in Margaret\u0027s way when she went out visiting or shopping. She greeted him very kindly on each particular occasion, but not once did she betray any interest in Francis Bethune or his fellow-prisoners. When Nan met Cephas, on the occasion of the interview which has just been reported, she was on her way to Neighbour Tomlin\u0027s to pay a visit to Margaret, and thither she went, after giving Cephas the benefit of her views as to his mental capacity. Margaret happened to be out at the moment, but Miss Fanny insisted that Nan should come in anyhow. \"Margaret will be back directly,\" Miss Fanny said; \"she has only gone to the stores to match a piece of ribbon. Besides, I want to talk to you a little while. But good gracious! what is the matter with you? I expected cheerfulness from you at least, but what do I find? Well, you and Margaret should live in the same house; they say misery loves company. Here I was about to ask you why Margaret is unhappy, and I find you looking out of Margaret\u0027s eyes. Are you unhappy, too?\" \"No, Aunt Fanny, I\u0027m not unhappy; I\u0027m angry. I don\u0027t see why girls should become grown. Why, I was always in a good humour until I put on long skirts, and then my troubles began. I can neither run nor play; I must be on my dignity all the time for fear some one will raise her hands and say, \u0027Do look at that Nan Dorrington! Isn\u0027t she a bold piece?\u0027 I never was so tired of anything in my life as I am of being grown. I never will get used to it.\" \"Oh, you\u0027ll get in the habit of it after awhile, child,\" said Miss Fanny. \"But I never would have believed that Nan Dorrington would care very much for what people said.\" \"Oh, it isn\u0027t on my account that I care,\" remarked Nan, with a toss of her head, \"but I don\u0027t want my friends to have their feelings hurt by what other people say. If there is anything in this world I detest it is dignity—I don\u0027t mean Margaret\u0027s kind, because she was born so and can\u0027t help it—but the kind that is put on and taken off like a summer bonnet. If I can\u0027t be myself, I\u0027ll do like Leese Clopton did, I\u0027ll go into a convent.\" \"Well, you certainly would astonish the nuns when you began to cut some of your capers,\" Miss Fanny declared. \"Am I as bad as all that? Tell me honestly, Aunt Fanny, now while I am in the humour to hear it, what do I do that is so terrible?\" \"Honestly, Nan, you do nothing terrible at all. Not even Miss Puella Gillum could criticise you.\" \"Why, Miss Puella never criticises any one. She\u0027s just as sweet as she can be.\" \"Well, she\u0027s an old maid, you know, and old maids are supposed to be critical,\" said Miss Fanny. \"I\u0027ll tell you where all the trouble is, Nan: you are sensitive, and you have an idea that you must behave as some of the other girls do—that you must hold your hands and your head just so. If you would be yourself, and forget all about etiquette and manners, you\u0027d satisfy everybody, especially yourself.\" \"Why, that is what worries me now; I do forget all about those things, and then, all of a sudden, I realise that I am acting like a child, and a very noisy child at that, and then I\u0027m afraid some one will make remarks. It is all very miserable and disagreeable, and I wish there wasn\u0027t a long skirt in the world.\" \"Well, when you get as old as I am,\" sighed Miss Fanny, \"you won\u0027t mind little things like that. Margaret is coming now. I\u0027ll leave you with her. Try to find out why she is unhappy. Pulaski is nearly worried to death about it, and so am I.\" Margaret Gaither came in as sedately as an old woman. She was very fond of Nan, and greeted her accordingly. Whatever her trouble was, it had made no attack on her health. She had a fine color, and her eyes were bright; but there was the little frown between her eyebrows that had attracted the attention of Gabriel, and it gave her a troubled look. \"If you\u0027ll tell me something nice and pleasant,\" she said to Nan, \"I\u0027ll be under many obligations to you. Tell me something funny, or if you don\u0027t know anything funny, tell me something horrible—anything for a change. I saw Cephas downtown; that child has been trying for days to tell me of his adventures, and I have been dying to hear them. But I keep out of his way; I am so perverse that I refuse to give myself that much pleasure. Oh, if you only knew how mean I am, you wouldn\u0027t sit there smiling. I hear that the dear boys are having a good deal of trouble. Well, it serves them right; they had no business to be boys. They should have been girls; then they would have been perfectly happy all the time. Don\u0027t you think so, sweet child?\" Nan regarded her friend with astonishment. She had never heard her talk in such a strain before. \"Why, what is the matter with you, Margaret? You know that girls can be as unhappy as boys; yes, and a thousand times more so.\" \"Oh, I\u0027ll never believe it! never!\" cried Margaret. \"Why, do you mean to tell me that any girl can be unhappy? You\u0027ll have to prove it, Nan; you\u0027ll have to give the name, and furnish dates, and then you\u0027ll have to give the reason. Do you mean to insinuate that you intend to offer yourself as the horrible example? Fie on you, Nan! You\u0027re in love, and you mistake that state for unhappiness. Why, that is the height of bliss. Look at me! I\u0027m in love, and see how happy I am!\" \"I know one thing,\" said Nan, and her voice was low and subdued, \"if you go on like that, you\u0027ll frighten me away. Do you want to make your best friends miserable?\" \"Why, certainly,\" replied Margaret. \"What are friends for? I should dislike very much to have a friend that I couldn\u0027t make miserable. But if you think you are going to run away, come up to my room and we\u0027ll lock ourselves in, and then I know you can\u0027t get away.\" \"Now, what is the matter?\" Nan insisted, when they had gone upstairs, and were safe in Margaret\u0027s room. She had seized her friend in her arms, and her tone was imploring. \"I don\u0027t think I can tell you, Nan; you would consider me a fool, and I want to keep your good opinion. But I can tell you a part of my troubles. He wants me to marry Francis Bethune! Think of that!\" She paused and looked at Nan. \"Well, why don\u0027t you congratulate me?\" \"I\u0027ll never believe that,\" said Nan, decisively. \"Did he say that he wanted you to marry Frank Bethune?\" The \"he\" in this case was Pulaski Tomlin. \"Well, he didn\u0027t insist on it; he\u0027s too kind for that. But Francis has been coming here very often, until our friends in blue gave him a much-needed rest, and I suppose I must have been going around looking somewhat gloomy; you know how I am—I can\u0027t be gay; and then he asked me what the trouble was, and finally said that Francis would make me a good husband. Why, I could have killed myself! Think of me, in this house, and occupying the position I do!\" Such heat and fury Nan had never seen her friend display before. \"Why, Margaret!\" she cried, \"you don\u0027t know what you are saying. Why, if he or Aunt Fanny could hear you, they would be perfectly miserable. I don\u0027t see how you can feel that way.\" \"No, you don\u0027t, and I hope you never will!\" exclaimed Margaret. \"Nobody knows how I feel. If I could, I would tell you—but I can\u0027t, I can\u0027t!\" \"Margaret,\" said Nan, in a most serious tone, \"has he or Aunt Fanny ever treated you unkindly?\" Nan was prepared to hear the worst. \"Unkindly!\" cried Margaret, bursting into tears; \"oh, I wish they would! I wish they would treat me as I deserve to be treated. Oh, if he would treat me cruelly, or do something to wound my feelings, I would bless him.\" Margaret had led Nan into a strange country, so to speak, and she knew not which way to turn or what to say. Something was wrong, but what? Of all Nan\u0027s acquaintances, Margaret was the most self-contained, the most evenly balanced. Many and many a time Nan had envied Margaret\u0027s serenity, and now here she was in tears, after talking as wildly as some hysterical person. \"Come home with me, Margaret,\" cried Nan. \"Maybe the change would do you good.\" \"I thank you, Nan. You are as good as you can be; you are almost as good as the people here; but I can\u0027t go. I can\u0027t leave this house for any length of time until I leave it for good. I\u0027d be wild to get back; my misery fascinates me; I hate it and hug it.\" \"I am sure that I don\u0027t understand you at all,\" said Nan, in a tone of despair. \"No, and you never will,\" Margaret affirmed. \"To understand you would have to feel as I do, and I hope you may be spared that experience all the days of your life.\" After awhile Nan decided that Margaret would be more comfortable if she were alone, and so she bade her friend good-bye, and went downstairs, where she found Miss Fanny awaiting her somewhat impatiently. \"Well, what is the trouble, child?\" she asked. Nan shook her head. \"I don\u0027t know, Aunt Fanny, and I don\u0027t believe she knows herself.\" \"But didn\u0027t she give you some hint—some intimation? I don\u0027t want to be inquisitive, child; but if she\u0027s in trouble, I want to find some remedy for it. Pulaski is in a terrible state of mind about her, and I am considerably worried myself. We love her just as much as if she were our own, and yet we can\u0027t go to her and make a serious effort to discover what is worrying her. She is proud and sensitive, and we have to be very careful. Oh, I hope we have done nothing to wound that child\u0027s feelings.\" \"It isn\u0027t that,\" replied Nan. \"I asked her, and she said that you treated her too kindly.\" \"Well,\" sighed Miss Fanny, \"if she won\u0027t confide in us, she\u0027ll have to bear her troubles alone. It is a pity, but sometimes it is best.\" And then there came a knock on the door, and it was so sudden and unexpected that Nan gave a jump. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77515.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
