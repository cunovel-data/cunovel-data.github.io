{"id":23577,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER FIVE The Story of Margaret Gaither","content":"Gabriel and Cephas started toward their homes, which lay in the same direction. Instead of going around by road or street, they cut across the fields and woods. Before they had gone very far, they heard a rustling, swishing sound in the pine-thicket through which they were passing, but gave it little attention, both being used to the noises common to the forest. In their minds it was either a rabbit or a grey fox scuttling away; or a poree scratching in the bushes, or a ground-squirrel running in the underbrush. But a moment later, Nan Dorrington, followed by Tasma Tid, burst from the pine-thicket, crying, \"Oh, you walk so fast, you two!\" She was panting and laughing, and as she stood before the lads, one little hand at her throat, and the other vainly trying to control her flying hair, a delicious rosiness illuminating her face, Gabriel knew that he had just been doing her a gross injustice. As he walked along the path, followed by his faithful Cephas, he had been mentally comparing her to a young woman he had just seen in Mr. Goodlett\u0027s hack; and had been saying to himself that the new-comer was, if possible, more beautiful than Nan. But now here was Nan herself in person, and Gabriel\u0027s comparisons appeared to be shabby indeed. With Nan before his eyes, he could see what a foolish thing it was to compare her with any one in this world except herself. There was a flavour of wildness in her beauty that gave it infinite charm and variety. It was a wildness that is wedded to grace and vivacity, such as we see embodied in the form and gestures of the wood-dove, or the partridge, or the flying squirrel, when it is un-awed by the presence of man. The flash of her dark brown eyes, her tawny hair blowing free, and her lithe figure, with the dark green pines for a background, completed the most charming picture it is possible for the mind to conceive. All that Gabriel was conscious of, beyond a dim surprise that Nan should be here—the old Nan that he used to know—was a sort of dawning thrill of ecstasy as he contemplated her. He stood staring at her with his mouth open. \"Why do you look at me like that, Gabriel?\" she cried; \"I am no ghost. And why do you walk so fast? I have been running after you as hard as I can. And, wasn\u0027t that Francis Bethune in the waggon with Mr. Sanders?\" \"Did you run hard just to ask me that? Mrs. Absalom could have saved you all this trouble.\" The mention of Bethune\u0027s name had brought Gabriel to earth, and to commonplace thoughts again. \"Yes, that was Master Bethune, and he has grown to be a very handsome young man.\" \"Oh, he was always good-looking,\" said Nan lightly. \"Where are you and Cephas going?\" \"Straight home,\" replied Gabriel. \"Well, I\u0027m going there, too. I heard Nonny\" (this was Mrs. Absalom) \"say that Margaret Gaither has come home again, and then I remembered that your grandmother promised to tell me a story about her some day. I\u0027m going to tease her to-day until she tells it.\" \"And didn\u0027t Mrs. Absalom tell you that Bethune was in the waggon with Mr. Sanders?\" Gabriel inquired, in some astonishment. \"Oh, Gabriel! you are so—\" Nan paused as if hunting for the right term or word. Evidently she didn\u0027t find it, for she turned to Gabriel with a winning smile, and asked what Mr. Sanders had had to say. \"I\u0027m so glad he\u0027s come I don\u0027t know what to do. I wouldn\u0027t live in a town that didn\u0027t have its Mr. Sanders,\" she declared. \"Well, about the first thing he said was to remind Bethune of the time when you whacked him over the head with a cudgel.\" \"And what did Master Francis say to that?\" inquired Nan, with a laugh. \"Why, what could he say? He simply turned red. Now, if it had been me, I——\" The path was so narrow, that Nan, the two lads, and Tasma Tid were walking in Indian file. Nan stopped so suddenly and unexpectedly that Gabriel fell against her. As he did so, she turned and seized him by the arm, and emphasised her words by shaking him gently as each was uttered. \"Now—Gabriel—don\u0027t—say—disagreeable—things!\" What she meant he had not the least idea, and it was not the first nor the last time that his wit lacked the nimbleness to follow and catch her meaning. \"Disagreeable!\" he exclaimed. \"Why, I was simply going to say that if I had been in Bethune\u0027s shoes to-day, I should have declared that you did the proper thing.\" Nan dropped a low curtsey, saying, \"Oh, thank you, sir—what was the gentleman\u0027s name, Cephas—the gentleman who was such a cavalier?\" \"Was he a Frenchman?\" asked Cephas. \"Oh, Cephas! you should be ashamed. You have as little learning as I.\" With that she turned and went along the path at such a rapid pace that it was as much as the lads could do to keep up with her, without breaking into an undignified trot. Nan went home with Gabriel; was there before him indeed, for he paused a moment to say something to Cephas. She ran along the walk, took the steps two at a time, and as she ran skipping along the hallway, she cried out: \"Grandmother Lumsden! where are you? Oh, what do you think? Margaret Gaither has come home!\" When Gabriel entered the room, Nan had fetched a footstool, and was already sitting at Mrs. Lumsden\u0027s feet, holding one of the old lady\u0027s frail, but beautiful white hands. Here was another picture, the beauty of which dawned on Gabriel later—youth and innocence sitting at the feet of sweet and wholesome old age. The lad was always proud of his grandmother, but never more so than at that moment when her beauty and refinement were brought into high relief by her attitude toward Nan Dorrington. Gabriel was very happy to be near those two. Not for a weary time had Nan been so friendly and familiar as she was now, and he felt a kind of exaltation. \"Margaret Gaither! Margaret Gaither!\" Gabriel\u0027s grandmother repeated the name as if trying to summon up some memory of the past. \"Poor girl! Did you see her, Gabriel? And how did she look?\" With a boy\u0027s bluntness, he described her physical condition, exaggerating, perhaps, its worst features, for these had made a deep impression on him. \"Oh, I\u0027m so sorry for her! and she has a daughter!\" said Mrs. Lumsden softly. \"I will call on them as soon as possible. And then if poor Margaret is unable to return the visit, the daughter will come. And you must be here, Nan; Gabriel will fetch you. And you, Gabriel—for once you must be polite and agreeable. Candace shall brush up your best suit, and if it is to be mended, I will mend it.\" Nan and Gabriel laughed at this. Both knew that this famous best suit would not reach to the lad\u0027s ankles, and that the sleeves of the coat would end a little way below the elbow. \"I can\u0027t imagine what you are laughing at,\" said Mrs. Lumsden, with a faint smile. \"I am sure the suit is a very respectable one, especially when you have none better.\" \"No, Grandmother Lumsden; Gabriel will have to take his tea in the kitchen with Aunt Candace.\" However, the affair never came off. The dear old lady, in whom the social instinct was so strong, had no opportunity to send the invitation until long afterward. Nan was compelled to beg very hard for the story of Margaret Gaither. It was never the habit of Gabriel\u0027s grandmother to indulge in idle gossip; she could always find some excuse for the faults of those who were unfortunate; but Nan had the art of persuasion at her tongue\u0027s end. Whether it was this fact or the fact that Mrs. Lumsden believed that the story carried a moral that Nan would do well to digest, it would be impossible to say. At any rate, the youngsters soon had their desire. The story will hardly bear retelling; it can be compressed into a dozen lines, and be made as uninteresting as a newspaper paragraph; but, as told by Gabriel\u0027s grandmother, it had the charm which sympathy and pity never fail to impart to a narrative. When it came to an end, Nan was almost in tears, though she could never tell why. \"It happened, Nan, before you and Gabriel were born,\" said Mrs. Lumsden. \"Margaret Gaither was one of the most beautiful girls I have ever seen, and at that time Pulaski Tomlin was one of the handsomest young men in all this region. Naturally these two were drawn together. They were in love with each other from the first, and, finally, a day was set for the wedding. They were to have been married in November, but one night in October, the Tomlin Place was found to be on fire. The flames had made considerable headway before they were discovered, and, to me, it was a most horrible sight. Yet, horrible as it was, there was a fascination about it. The sweeping roar of the flames attracted me and held me spellbound, but I hope I shall never be under such a spell again. \"Well, it was impossible to save the house, and no one attempted such a preposterous feat. It was all that the neighbours could do to prevent the spread of the flames to the nearby houses. Some of the furniture was saved, but the house was left to burn. All of a sudden, Fanny Tomlin——\" \"You mean Aunt Fanny?\" interrupted Nan. \"Yes, my dear. All of a sudden Fanny Tomlin remembered that her mother\u0027s portrait had been left hanging on the wall. Without a word to any one she ran into the house. How she ever passed through the door safely, I never could understand, for every instant, it seemed to me, great tongues and sheets of flame were darting across it and lapping and licking inward, as if trying to force an entrance. You may be sure that we who were looking on, helpless, held our breaths when Fanny Tomlin disappeared through the doorway. Pulaski Tomlin was not a witness to this performance, but he was quickly informed of it; and then he ran this way and that, like one distraught. Twice he called her name, and his voice must have been heard above the roar of the flames, for presently she appeared at an upper window, and cried out, \u0027What is it, brother?\u0027 \u0027Come down! Come out!\u0027 he shouted. \u0027I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t,\u0027 she answered; and then she waved her hand and disappeared, after trying vainly to close the blinds. \"But no sooner had Pulaski Tomlin caught a glimpse of his sister, and heard her voice, than he lowered his head like an angry bull, and rushed through the flames that now had possession of the door. I, for one, never expected to see him again; and I stood there frightened, horrified, fascinated, utterly helpless. Oh, when you go through a trial like that, my dear,\" said Mrs. Lumsden, stroking Nan\u0027s hair gently, \"you will realise how small and weak and contemptible human beings are when they are engaged in a contest with the elements. There we stood, helpless and horror-stricken, with two of our friends in the burning house, which was now almost completely covered with the roaring flames. What thoughts I had I could never tell you, but I wondered afterward that I had not become suddenly grey. \"We waited an age, it seemed to me. Major Tomlin Perdue, of Halcyondale, who happened to be here at the time, was walking about wringing his hands and crying like a child. Up to that moment, I had thought him to be a hard and cruel man, but we can never judge others, not even our closest acquaintances, until we see them put to the test. Suddenly, I heard Major Perdue cry, \u0027Ah!\u0027 and saw him leap forward as a wild animal leaps. \"Through the doorway, which was now entirely covered with a roaring flame, a blurred and smoking figure had rushed—a bulky, shapeless figure, it seemed—and then it collapsed and fell, and lay in the midst of the smoke, almost within reach of the flames. But Major Perdue was there in an instant, and he dragged the shapeless mass away from the withering heat and stifling smoke. After this, he had more assistance than was necessary or desirable. \"\u0027Stand back!\u0027 he cried; and his voice had in it the note that men never fail to obey. \u0027Stand back there! Where is Dorrington? Why isn\u0027t he here?\u0027 Your father, my dear, had gone into the country to see a patient. He was on his way home when he saw the red reflection of the flames in the sky, and he hastened as rapidly as his horse could go. He arrived just in the nick of time. He heard his name called as he drove up, and was prompt to answer. \u0027Make way there!\u0027 commanded Major Perdue; \u0027make way for Dorrington. And you ladies go home! There\u0027s nothing you can do here.\u0027 Then I heard Fanny Tomlin call my name, and Major Perdue repeated in a ringing voice, \u0027Lucy Lumsden is wanted here!\u0027 \"I don\u0027t know how it was, but every command given by Major Perdue was obeyed promptly. The crowd dispersed at once, with the exception of two or three, who were detailed to watch the few valuables that had been saved, and a few men who lingered to see if they could be of any service. \"Pulaski Tomlin had been kinder to his sister than to himself. Only the hem of her dress was scorched. It may be absurd to say so, but that was the first thing I noticed; and, in fact, that was all the injury she had suffered. Her brother had found her unconscious on a bed, and he simply rolled her in the quilts and blankets, and brought her downstairs, and out through the smoke and flame to the point where he fell. Fanny has not so much as a scar to show. But you can look at her brother\u0027s face and see what he suffered. When they lifted him into your father\u0027s buggy, his outer garments literally crumbled beneath the touch, and one whole side of his face was raw and bleeding. \"But he never thought of himself, though the agony he endured must have been awful. His first word was about his sister: \u0027Is Fanny hurt?\u0027 And when he was told that she was unharmed, he closed his eyes, saying, \u0027Don\u0027t worry about me.\u0027 We brought him here—it was Fanny\u0027s wish—and by the time he had been placed in bed, the muscles of his mouth were drawn as you see them now. There was nothing to do but to apply cold water, and this was done for the most part by Major Perdue, though both Fanny and I were anxious to relieve him. I never saw a man so devoted in his attentions. He was absolutely tireless; and I was so struck with his tender solicitude that I felt obliged to make to him what was at once a confession and an apology. \u0027I once thought, Major Perdue, that you were a hard and cruel man,\u0027 said I, \u0027but I\u0027ll never think so again.\u0027 \"\u0027But why did you think so in the first place?\u0027 he asked. \"\u0027Well, I had heard of several of your shooting scrapes,\u0027 I replied. \"He regarded me with a smile. \u0027There are two sides to everything, especially a row,\u0027 he said. \u0027I made up my mind when a boy that turn-about is fair play. When I insult a man, I\u0027m prepared to take the consequences; yet I never insulted a man in my life. The man that insults me must pay for it. Women may wipe their feet on me, and children may spit on me; but no man shall insult me, not by so much as the lift of an eyelash, or the twitch of an upper-lip. Pulaski here has done me many a favour, some that he tried to hide, and I\u0027d never get through paying him if I were to nurse him night and day for the rest of my natural life. In some things, Ma\u0027am, you\u0027ll find me almost as good as a dog.\u0027 \"I must have given him a curious stare,\" continued Mrs. Lumsden, \"for he laughed softly, and remarked, \u0027If you\u0027ll think it over, Ma\u0027am, you\u0027ll find that a dog has some mighty fine qualities.\u0027 And it is true.\" \"But what about Margaret Gaither?\" inquired Nan, who was determined that the love-story should not be lost in a wilderness of trifles—as she judged them to be. \"Poor Margaret!\" murmured Gabriel\u0027s grandmother. \"I declare! I had almost forgotten her. Well, bright and early the next morning, Margaret came and asked to see Pulaski Tomlin. I left her in the parlour, and carried her request to the sick-room. \"\u0027Brother,\u0027 said Fanny, \u0027Margaret is here, and wants to see you. Shall she come in?\u0027 \"I saw Pulaski clench his hands; his bosom heaved and his lips quivered. \u0027Not for the world!\u0027 he exclaimed; \u0027oh, not for the world!\u0027 \"\u0027I can\u0027t tell her that,\u0027 said I. \u0027Nor I,\u0027 sobbed Fanny, covering her face with her hands. \u0027Oh, it will kill her!\u0027 \"Major Perdue turned to me, his eyes wet. \u0027Do you know why he doesn\u0027t want her to see him?\u0027 I could only give an affirmative nod. \u0027Do you know, Fanny?\u0027 She could only say, \u0027Yes, yes!\u0027 between her sobs. \u0027It is for her sake alone; we all see that,\u0027 declared Major Perdue. \u0027Now, then,\u0027 he went on, touching me on the arm, \u0027I want you to see how hard a hard man can be. Show me where the poor child is.\u0027 \"I led him to the parlour door. He stood aside for me to enter first, but I shook my head and leaned against the door for support. \u0027This is Miss Gaither?\u0027 he said, as he entered alone. \u0027My name is Perdue—Tomlin Perdue. We are very sorry, but no one is permitted to see Pulaski, except those who are nursing him.\u0027 \u0027That is what I am here for,\u0027 she said, \u0027and no one has a better right. I am to be his wife; we are to be married next month.\u0027 \u0027It is not a matter of right, Miss Gaither. Are you prepared to sustain a very severe shock?\u0027 \u0027Why, what—what is the trouble?\u0027 \u0027Can you not conceive a reason why you should not see him now—at this time, and for many days to come?\u0027 \u0027I cannot,\u0027 she replied haughtily. \u0027That, Miss Gaither, is precisely the reason why you are not to see him now,\u0027 said Major Perdue. His tone was at once humble and tender. \u0027I don\u0027t understand you at all,\u0027 she exclaimed almost violently. \u0027I tell you I will see him; I\u0027ll beat upon the wall; I\u0027ll lie across the door, and compel you to open it. Oh, why am I treated so and by his friends!\u0027 She flung herself upon a sofa, weeping wildly; and there I found her, when, a moment later, I entered the room in response to a gesture from Major Perdue. \"Whether she glanced up and saw me, or whether she divined my presence, I could never guess,\" Gabriel\u0027s grandmother went on, \"but without raising her face, she began to speak to me. \u0027This is your house, Miss Lucy,\u0027 she said—she always called me Miss Lucy—\u0027and why can\u0027t I, his future wife, go in and speak to Pulaski; or, at the very least, hold his hand, and help you and Fanny minister to his wants?\u0027 I made her no answer, for I could not trust myself to speak; I simply sat on the edge of the sofa by her, and stroked her hair, trying in this mute way to demonstrate my sympathy. She seemed to take some comfort from this, and finally put her request in a different shape. Would I permit her to sit in a chair near the door of the room in which Pulaski lay, until such time as she could see him? \u0027I will give you no trouble whatever,\u0027 she said. \u0027I am determined to see him,\u0027 she declared; \u0027he is mine, and I am his.\u0027 I gave a cordial assent to this proposition, carried a comfortable chair and placed it near the door, and there she stationed herself. \"I went into the room where the others were, and was surprised to see Fanny Tomlin looking so cheerful. Even Major Perdue appeared to be relieved. Fanny asked me a question with her eyes, and I answered it aloud. \u0027She is sitting by the door, and says she will remain there until she can see Pulaski.\u0027 He beat his hand against the headboard of the bed, his mental agony was so great, and kept murmuring to himself. Major Perdue turned his back on his friend\u0027s writhings, and went to the window. Presently he returned to the bedside, his watch in his hand. \u0027Pulaski,\u0027 he said, \u0027if she\u0027s there fifteen minutes from now, I shall invite her in.\u0027 Pulaski Tomlin made no reply, and we continued our ministrations in perfect silence. \"A few minutes later, I had occasion to go into my own room for a strip of linen, and to my utter amazement, the chair I had placed for Margaret Gaither was empty. Had she gone for a drink of water, or for a book? I went from room to room, calling her name, but she had gone; and I have never laid eyes on her from that day to this. She went away to Malvern on a visit, and while there eloped with a Louisiana man named Bridalbin, whose reputation was none too savoury, and we never heard of her again. Even her Aunt Polly lost all trace of her.\" \"What did Mr. Tomlin say when you told him she was gone?\" Nan inquired. \"We never told him. I think he understood that she was gone almost as soon as she went, for his spiritual faculties are very keen. I remember on one occasion, and that not so very long ago, when he refused to retire at night, because he had a feeling that he would be called for; and his intuitions were correct. He was summoned to the bedside of one of his friends in the country, and, as he went along, he carried your father with him. Margaret Gaither, such as she was, was the sum and the substance of his first and last romance. He suffered, but his suffering has made him strong. \"Yes,\" Mrs. Lumsden went on, \"it has made him strong and great in the highest sense. Do you know why he is called Neighbour Tomlin? It is because he loves his neighbours as he loves himself. There is no sacrifice that he will not make for them. The poorest and meanest person in the world, black or white, can knock at Neighbour Tomlin\u0027s door any hour of the day or night, and obtain food, money or advice, as the case may be. If his wife or his children are ill, Neighbour Tomlin will get out of bed and go in the cold and rain, and give them the necessary attention. To me, there never was a more beautiful countenance in the world than Neighbour Tomlin\u0027s poor scarred face. But for that misfortune we should probably never have known what manner of man he is. The Providence that urged Margaret Gaither to fly from this house was arranging for the succour of many hundreds of unfortunates, and Pulaski Tomlin was its instrument.\" \"If I had been Margaret Gaither,\" said Nan, clenching her hands together, \"I never would have left that door. Never! They couldn\u0027t have dragged me away. I\u0027ve never been in love, I hope, but I have feelings that tell me what it is, and I never would have gone away.\" \"Well, we must not judge others,\" said Gabriel\u0027s grandmother gently. \"Poor Margaret acted according to her nature. She was vain, and lacked stability, but I really believe that Providence had a hand in the whole matter.\" \"I know I\u0027m pretty,\" remarked Nan, solemnly, \"but I\u0027m not vain.\" \"Why, Nan!\" exclaimed Mrs. Lumsden, laughing; \"what put in your head the idea that you are pretty?\" \"I don\u0027t mean my own self,\" explained Nan, \"but the other self that I see in the glass. She and I are very good friends, but sometimes we quarrel. She isn\u0027t the one that would have stayed at the door, but my own, own self.\" Mrs. Lumsden looked at the girl closely to see if she was joking, but Nan was very serious indeed. \"I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t understand you,\" said Gabriel\u0027s grandmother. \"Gabriel does,\" replied Nan complacently. Gabriel understood well enough, but he never could have explained it satisfactorily to any one who was unfamiliar with Nan\u0027s way of putting things. \"Well, you are certainly a pretty girl, Nan,\" Gabriel\u0027s grandmother admitted, \"and when you and Francis Bethune are married, you will make a handsome pair.\" \"When Francis Bethune and I are married!\" exclaimed Nan, giving a swift side-glance at Gabriel, who pretended to be reading. \"Why, what put such an idea in your head, Grandmother Lumsden?\" \"Why, it is on the cards, my dear. It is what, in my young days, they used to call the proper caper.\" \"Well, when Frank and I are to be married, I\u0027ll send you a card of invitation so large that you will be unable to get it in the front door.\" She rose from the footstool, saying, \"I must go home; good-bye, everybody; and send me word when you have chocolate cake.\" This was so much like the Nan who had been his comrade for so long that Gabriel felt a little thrill of exultation. A little later he asked his grandmother what she meant by saying that it was on the cards for Nan to marry Bethune. \"Why, I have an idea that the matter has already been arranged,\" she answered with a knowing smile. \"It would be so natural and appropriate. You are too young to appreciate the wisdom of such arrangements, Gabriel, but you will understand it when you are older. Nan is not related in any way to the Cloptons, though a great many people think so. Her grandmother was captured by the Creeks when only a year or two old. She was the only survivor of a party of seven which had been ambushed by the Indians. She was too young to give any information about herself. She could say a few words, and she knew that her name was Rosalind, but that was all. She was ransomed by General McGillivray, and sent to Shady Dale. Under the circumstances, there was nothing for Raleigh Clopton to do but adopt her. Thus she became Rosalind Clopton. She married Benier Odom when, as well as could be judged, she was more than forty years old. Randolph Dorrington married her daughter, who died when Nan was born. Marriage, Gabriel, is not what young people think it is; and I do hope that when you take a wife, it will be some one you have known all your life.\" \"I hope so, too,\" Gabriel responded with great heartiness. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77492.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
