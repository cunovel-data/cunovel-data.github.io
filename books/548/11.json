{"id":23582,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER TEN The Troubles of Nan","content":"\"Why, what on earth ails the child?\" exclaimed Mrs. Absalom. Nan was leaning back in the chair, her face very red, making an effort to fan herself with one little hand, and panting wildly. \"Malindy!\" Mrs. Absalom yelled to the cook, \"run here an\u0027 fetch the camphire as you come! Ain\u0027t you comin\u0027? The laws a massy on us! the child\u0027ll be cold and stiff before you start! Honey, what on earth ails you? Tell your Nonny. Has anybody pestered you? Ef they have, jest tell me the\u0027r name, an\u0027 I\u0027ll foller \u0027em to the jumpin\u0027-off place but what I\u0027ll frail \u0027em out. You Malindy! whyn\u0027t you come on? You\u0027ll go faster\u0027n that to your own funeral.\" But when Malindy came with the camphor, and a dose of salts in a tumbler, Nan waved her away. \"I don\u0027t want any physic, Nonny,\" she said, still panting, for her run had been a long one; \"I\u0027m just tired from running. And, oh, Nonny! I have something to tell you.\" \"Well, my life!\" exclaimed Mrs. Absalom indignantly, withdrawing her arms from around Nan, and rising to her feet. \"A little more, an\u0027 you\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 had me ready for my coolin\u0027-board. I ain\u0027t had such a turn—not sence the day a nigger boy run in the gate an\u0027 tol\u0027 me the Yankees was a-hangin\u0027 Ab. An\u0027 all bekaze you\u0027ve hatched out some rigamarole that nobody on the green earth would \u0027a\u0027 thought of but you.\" She fussed around a little, and was for going about the various unnecessary duties she imposed on herself; but Nan protested. \"Please, Nonny, wait until I tell you.\" Thereupon Nan told as well as she could of the conversation she and Gabriel had overheard in town, and the recital gave Mrs. Absalom a more serious feeling than she had had in many a day. Her muscular arms, bare to the elbow, were folded across her ample bosom, and she seemed to be glaring at Nan with a frown on her face, but she was thinking. \"Well,\" she said with a sigh, \"I knowed there was gwine to be trouble of some kind—old Billy Sanders went by here this mornin\u0027 as drunk as a lord.\" \"Drunk!\" cried Nan with blanched face. \"Well, sorter tollerbul how-come-you-so. The last time old Billy was drunk, was when sesaytion was fetched on. Ev\u0027ry time he runs a straw in a jimmy-john, he fishes up trouble. An\u0027 my dream\u0027s out. I dremp last night that a wooden-leg man come to the door, an\u0027 ast me for a pair of shoes. I ast him what on earth he wanted wi\u0027 a pair, bein\u0027s he had but one foot. He said that the foot he didn\u0027t have was constant a-feelin\u0027 like it was cold, an\u0027 he allowed maybe it\u0027d feel better ef it know\u0027d that he had a shoe ready for it ag\u0027in colder weather.\" \"Oh, I hate him! I just naturally despise him!\" cried Nan. When she was angry her face was pale, and it was very pale now. \"Why do you hate the wooden-leg man, honey? It was all in a dream,\" said Mrs. Absalom, soothingly. \"Oh, I don\u0027t know what you are talking about, Nonny!\" exclaimed Nan, ready to cry. \"I mean old Billy Sanders. And if I don\u0027t give him a piece of my mind when I see him. Now Gabriel will go to that place to-night, and he\u0027s nothing but a boy.\" \"A boy! well, I dunner where you\u0027ll find your men ef Gabriel ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 but a boy. Where\u0027s anybody in these diggin\u0027s that\u0027s any bigger or stouter? I wish you\u0027d show \u0027em to me,\" remarked Mrs. Absalom. \"I don\u0027t care,\" Nan persisted; \"I know just what Gabriel will do. He\u0027ll go to that place to-night, and—and—I\u0027d rather go there myself.\" \"Well, my life!\" exclaimed Mrs. Absalom, with lifted eyebrows. The pallor of Nan\u0027s face was gradually replaced by a warmer glow. \"Now, Nonny! don\u0027t say a word—don\u0027t tease—don\u0027t tease me about Gabriel. If you do, I\u0027ll never tell you anything more for ever and ever.\" \"All this is bran new to me,\" Mrs. Absalom declared. \"You make me feel, Nan, like I was in some strange place, talkin\u0027 wi\u0027 some un I never seed before. You ain\u0027t no more like yourself—you ain\u0027t no more like you used to be—than day is like night, an\u0027 I\u0027m jest as sorry as I can be.\" \"That\u0027s what Gabriel says,\" sighed Nan. \"He said he was sorry, and now you say you are sorry. Oh, Nonny, I don\u0027t want any one to be sorry for me.\" \"Well, then, behave yourself, an\u0027 be like you use to be, an\u0027 stop trollopin\u0027 aroun\u0027 wi\u0027 them highfalutin\u0027 gals downtown. They look like they know too much. All they talk about is boys, boys, boys, from mornin\u0027 till night; an\u0027 I noticed when they was spendin\u0027 a part of the\u0027r time here that you was just as bad. It was six of one an\u0027 twice three of the rest. Now you know that ain\u0027t a sign of good health for gals to be eternally talkin\u0027 about boys, \u0027specially sech ganglin\u0027, lop-sided creeturs as we\u0027ve got aroun\u0027 here.\" \"Where\u0027s Johnny?\" asked Nan, who evidently had no notion of getting in a controversy with Mrs. Absalom on the subject of boys. \"Johnny\" was her name for her step-mother, whose surname of Dion had been changed to \"Johns\" the day after she arrived at Shady Dale. The story of little Miss Johns has been told in another place and all that is necessary to add to the record is the fact that she had managed to endear herself to the critical, officious, and somewhat jealous Mrs. Absalom. Mrs. Dorrington had the tact and the charm of the best of her race. She was Nan\u0027s dearest friend and only confidante, and though she was not many years the girl\u0027s senior, she had an influence over her that saved Nan from many a bad quarter of an hour. Mrs. Dorrington was in her own room when Nan found her, sewing and singing softly to herself, the picture of happiness and content. Nan dropped on her knees beside her chair, and threw her arms impulsively around the little woman\u0027s neck. \"Tell me ever what it is, Nan, before you smother-cate me,\" said Mrs. Dorrington, smoothing the girl\u0027s hair. The two had a language of their own, which the elder had learned from the younger. \"It is the most miserable misery, Johnny. Do you remember what I told you about those people?\" \"How could I forget, Nan?\" \"Well, those people are going head foremost into trouble, and whatever happens, I want to be there.\" \"Oh, is that so? Well, it is too bad,\" said the little woman sympathetically. \"Perhaps if you would say something about it—not too much, but just enough for me to get it through my thick numskull——\" Whereupon Nan told of all the fears by which she was beset, and of all the troubles that racked her mind, and the two had quite a consultation. \"You are not afraid for yourself; why should you be afraid for those people?\" inquired Mrs. Dorrington, laying great stress on \"those people,\" the name that Gabriel went by when Nan and Johnny were referring to him. \"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" replied Nan, helplessly. \"It isn\u0027t because of what you would guess if you knew no better. I have a very great friendship for those people; but it isn\u0027t the other feeling—the kind that you were telling me about. If it is—oh, if it is—I shall never forgive myself.\" \"In time—yes. It is quite easy to forgive yourself on account of those people. I found it so.\" \"Oh, don\u0027t! You make me feel as if I ought never to speak to myself.\" \"Then don\u0027t,\" said Mrs. Dorrington, calmly. \"You can speak to me instead of to that ignorant girl.\" \"Oh, you sweetest!\" cried Nan, hugging her step-mother; \"I am going to have you for my doll.\" \"Very well, then,\" said Mrs. Dorrington, shrugging her shoulders; \"but you will have some trouble on your hands—yes, more than those people give you.\" \"Johnny, you are my little mother, and you never gave me any trouble in your life. I am the one that is troublesome; I am troubling you now.\" \"Silly thing! will you be good?\" cried Mrs. Dorrington, tapping Nan lightly on the cheek. \"How can you trouble me when I don\u0027t know what you mean? You haven\u0027t told me.\" \"I thought you could guess as well as I can,\" replied Nan. \"About some things—yes; but not about this terrible danger that is to overcome those people.\" Whereupon, Nan told Mrs. Dorrington of the conversation she and Gabriel had overheard. To this information she added her suspicions that Gabriel intended to do something desperate; and then she gave a very vivid description of the strange white man, of his pale and eager countenance, his glittering, shifty eyes, and his thin, cruel lips. Instead of shuddering, as she should have done, Mrs. Dorrington laughed. \"But I don\u0027t see what the trouble is,\" she declared. \"That boy is ever so large; he can take care of himself. But if you think not, then ask him to tea.\" Nan frowned heavily. \"But, Johnny, tea is so tame. Think of rescuing a friend from danger by means of a cup of tea! Doesn\u0027t it seem ridiculous?\" \"Of course it is,\" responded Mrs. Dorrington. \"But it isn\u0027t half so ridiculous as your make-believe. Oh, Nan! Nan! when will you come down from your clouds?\" Now, Nan\u0027s world of make-believe was as natural to her as the persons and things all about her. No sooner had she guessed that it was Gabriel\u0027s intention to find out what the union League was for, and, in a way, expose himself to some possible danger of discovery, than she carried the whole matter into her land of make-believe as naturally as a mocking-bird carries a flake of thistle-down to its nest. Once there, nothing could be more reasonable or more logical than the terrible danger to which Gabriel would be exposed. While it lasted, Nan\u0027s feeling of anxiety and alarm was both real and sincere. Mrs. Absalom could never enter into this world of Nan\u0027s; she was too practical and downright. And yet she had a ready sympathy for the girl\u0027s troubles and humoured her without stint, though she sometimes declared that Nan was queer and flighty. Mrs. Dorrington, on the other hand, inheriting the sensitive and artistic temperament of Flavian Dion, her father, was able to enter heartily into the most of Nan\u0027s vagaries. Sometimes she humoured them, but more frequently she laughed at them as the girl grew older. Occasionally, in her twilight conversations with her father, whose gentleness and shyness kept him in the background, Mrs. Dorrington would deplore Nan\u0027s tendency to exploit her imagination. \"But she was born thus, my dear,\" Flavian Dion would reply, speaking the picturesque patois of New France. \"It will either be her great misery, or her great happiness. How was it with me? Once it was my great misery, but now—you see how it is. Come! we will have some music, if Mademoiselle the Dreamer is willing.\" And then they would go into the parlour, where, with Mrs. Dorrington at the piano, Flavian Dion with his violin, and Nan with her voice, which was rich and strong, they would render the beautiful folk-songs of France. Moreover, Flavian Dion had caught many of the plantation melodies, of which Nan knew the words, and when the French songs were exhausted, they would fall back on these. It frequently happened that Mademoiselle the Dreamer would add feet as well as voice to the negro melodies, especially if Tasma Tid were there to incite her, and the way that Nan reproduced steps and poses was both wonderful and inimitable. The reader who takes the trouble to make inferences as he goes along, will perceive that Nan\u0027s solicitude for Gabriel was no compliment to him; it was not flattering to the heroism of a young man who was threatening to grow a moustache, for a young lady to believe, or even pretend to believe, that he needed to be rescued from some imaginary danger. Gabriel was strong enough to take a man\u0027s place at a log-rolling, and he would have had small relish for the information if he had been told that Nan Dorrington was planning to rescue him. Let the simple truth be told. Gabriel was no hero in Nan\u0027s eyes. He was merely a friend and former comrade, who now was in sad need of some one to take care of him. That was her belief, and she would have shrunk from the idea that Gabriel would one day be her lover. She had quite other views. Yes, indeed! Her lover must be a man who had passed through some desperate experiences. He must be a hero with sword and plume, a cutter and slasher, a man who had a relish for bloodshed, such as she had read about in the romances she had appropriated from her father\u0027s library. Nan had brought over from her childhood many queer dreams and fancies. Once upon a time, she had heard her elders talking of John A. Murrell, the notorious land-pirate and highwayman. The man was one of the coarsest and cruellest of modern ruffians, but about his name the common people had placed a halo of romance. It was said of him that he rescued beautiful maidens from their abductors, and restored them to their friends, and that he robbed the rich only to give to the poor. Sad to say, this ruffian was Nan\u0027s ideal hero. And now, when she was racking her brains to invent some bold and simple plan for the rescue of Gabriel, her mind reverted to this ideal hero of her childhood. \"If you insist, Johnny, I\u0027ll ask Gabriel to tea,\" Nan remarked for the second time; \"but, as you say, it is perfectly ridiculous. Whoever heard of rescuing persons by inviting them to supper?\" She paused a moment, and then went on with a sigh that would have sounded very real in Mrs. Absalom\u0027s ears, but which simply brought a smile to Mrs. Dorrington\u0027s face—\"Heigh-ho! What a pity John A. Murrell isn\u0027t alive to-day!\" \"And who is this Mr. Murrell?\" Mrs. Dorrington asked. \"He was a fierce robber-chief,\" replied Nan, placidly. \"He wore a big black beard, and a hat with a red feather in it. Over his left shoulder was a red sash, and he rode a big white horse. He carried two big pistols and a bowie-knife—Nonny can tell you all about him.\" Whereupon, Mrs. Dorrington jumped from her chair, and made an effort to catch the young romancer; and in a moment, the laughter of the pursuer, and the shrieks of the pursued, when she thought she was in danger of being caught, roused the echoes in the old house. Mrs. Absalom, who was in the kitchen, laughed and shook her head. \"I believe them two scamps will be children when they are sixty year old!\" But after awhile, when their romp was over, Nan suddenly discovered that she had been in very high spirits, and this, according to the constitution and by-laws of the land of make-believe, was an unpardonable offence, especially when, as now, a very dear friend was in danger. So she went out upon the veranda, and half-way down the steps, where she seated herself in an attitude of extreme dejection. While sitting there, Nan suddenly remembered that she did have a grievance and a very real one. Tasma Tid was in a state of insurrection. She had not been permitted to accompany her young mistress when the latter visited her girl-friends, and for a long time she had been sulking and pouting. An effort had been made to induce Tasma Tid to make herself useful, but even the strong will of Mrs. Absalom collapsed when it found itself in conflict with the bright-eyed African. Tasma Tid had been wounded in her tenderest part—her affections. Her sentiments and emotions, being primitive, were genuine. Her grief, when separated from Nan, was very keen. She refused to eat, and for the most part kept herself in seclusion, and no one was able to find her hiding-place. Now, when Nan threw herself upon the steps in an attitude of dejection, with her head on her arm, it happened that Tasma Tid was prowling about with the hope of catching a glimpse of her. The African, slipping around the house, suddenly came plump upon the object of her search. She stood still, and drew a long breath. Here was Honey Nan apparently in deep trouble. Tasma Tid crept up the steps as silently as a ghost, and sat beside the prostrate form. If Nan knew, she made no sign; nor did she move when the African laid a caressing hand on her hair. It was only when Tasma Tid leaned over and kissed Nan on the hand that she stirred. She raised her head, saying, \"You shouldn\u0027t do that, Tasma Tid; I\u0027m too mean.\" \"How come you dis away, Honey Nan?\" inquired the African in a low tone. \"Who been-a hu\u0027t you?\" \"No one,\" replied Nan; \"I am just mean.\" \"\u0027Tis ain\u0027t so, nohow. Somebody been-a hu\u0027t you. You show dem ter Tasma Tid—dee ain\u0027t hu\u0027t you no mo\u0027.\" \"Where have you been? Why did you go away and leave me?\" \"Nobody want we fer stay. You go off, an\u0027 den we go off. We go off an\u0027 walk, walk, walk in de graveyard—walk, walk, walk in de graveyard; an\u0027 den we go home way off yander in de woods.\" \"Home! why this is your home; it shall always be your home,\" cried Nan, touched by the forlorn look in Tasma Tid\u0027s eyes, and the despairing expression in her voice. \"No, no, Honey Nan; \u0027tis-a no home fer we when you drive we \u0027way fum foller you, when you shak-a yo\u0027 haid ef we come trot, trot \u0027hind you. We no want home lak dat. No, no, Honey Nan. We make home in de woods.\" \"Where is your home?\" Nan inquired, full of curiosity. \"We take-a you dey when dem sun go \u0027way.\" \"Well, you must stay here,\" said Nan, emphatically. \"You shall follow me wherever I go.\" \"You talk-a so dis time, Honey Nan; nex\u0027 time—\" Tasma Tid ran down the steps, and went along the walk mimicking Nan\u0027s movements, shaking her frock first on one side and then on the other. Then she looked over her shoulder, turned around with a frown, stamped her foot and made menacing gestures with her hands. \"Dat how \u0027twill be nex\u0027 time, Honey Nan.\" Hearing Mrs. Absalom laughing, Nan conjectured that she had witnessed Tasma Tid\u0027s performance. \"Nonny,\" she cried, \"do I really walk that way, and finger my skirt so?\" \"To a t,\" said Mrs. Absalom, laughing louder. \"Ef she was a foot an\u0027 a half higher, I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 made shore it was you practisin\u0027 ag\u0027in the time when you\u0027ll mince by the store where old Silas Tomlin\u0027s yearlin\u0027 is clerkin\u0027, or by the tavern peazzer, where Frank Bethune an\u0027 the rest of the loafers set at. It\u0027s among the merikels that Gabe Tolliver don\u0027t mix wi\u0027 that crowd. I reckon maybe it\u0027s bekaze he jest natchally too wuthless.\" \"Now, Nonny! I don\u0027t think you ought to make fun of me,\" protested Nan. \"I am perfectly certain that I don\u0027t mince when I walk, and you are always complaining that I don\u0027t care how my clothes look.\" \"Go roun\u0027 to the kitchen, you black slink,\" exclaimed Mrs. Absalom, addressing Tasma Tid, \"an\u0027 git your dinner! You\u0027ve traipsed and trolloped until I bet you can gulp down all the vittles on the place.\" \"And when you have finished your dinner, come to my room,\" said Nan. It was not often that Nan was to be found in her own room during the day, but now she remembered that she had promised to spend the night with Eugenia Claiborne; and how was she to invite Gabriel to tea, as Mrs. Dorrington had suggested? There was but one thing to do, and that was to break her engagement with Eugenia. She was of half a dozen minds what to say to her friend. She wrote note after note, only to destroy each one. She pulled her nose, stuck out her tongue, looked at the ceiling, and bit her thumb, but all to no purpose. Tasma Tid, who had finished her dinner, sat on the floor eying Nan as an intelligent dog eyes its master, ready to respond to look, word or gesture. Finally, the African, seeing Nan\u0027s perplexity, made a suggestion. \"Make dem cuss-words come,\" she said. Tasma Tid had heard men use profane language when fretted or irritated, and she supposed that it was a remedy for troubles both small and large. \"Be jigged if I haven\u0027t a mind to,\" cried Nan, laughing at the African\u0027s earnestness. But at last she flung her pen down, seized her hat, and, with an unspoken invitation to Tasma Tid, went out into the street, determined to go to the Gaither Place, where Eugenia lived, and present her excuses in person. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77497.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
