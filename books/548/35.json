{"id":23606,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR Nan Surrenders","content":"It was all over at last, and Gabriel found himself seated in the carriage, side by side with the demurest and the quietest young lady he had ever seen. He had shaken hands until his arm was sore, and he had hunted for Nan everywhere; and finally, when he had given up the search, he heard her calling him and saw her beckoning him from a carriage. There was not much of a greeting between them, and he saw at once that, while this was the Nan he had known all his life, she had changed greatly. What he didn\u0027t know was that the change had taken place while he was in the midst of his speech. She was just as beautiful as ever; in fact, her loveliness seemed to be enhanced by some new light in her eyes—or was it the way her head drooped?—or a touch of new-born humility in her attitude? Whatever it was, Gabriel found it very charming. To his surprise, he found himself quite at ease in her presence. The change, if it could be called such, had given him an advantage. \"You used to be afraid of me, Gabriel,\" said Nan, \"and now I am afraid of you. No, not afraid; you know what I mean,\" she explained. \"If I thought you were afraid of me, Nan, I\u0027d get out of the carriage and walk home,\" and then, as the carriage rolled and rocked along the firm clay road, Gabriel sat and watched her, studying her face whenever he had an opportunity. Neither seemed to have any desire to talk. Gabriel had forgotten all about his sufferings in the sweat-boxes of Fort Pulaski; but those experiences had left an indelible mark on his character, and on his features. They had strengthened him every way—strengthened and subdued him. He was the same Gabriel, and yet there was a difference, and this difference appealed to Nan in a way that astonished her. She sat in the carriage perfectly happy, and yet she felt that a good cry would help her wonderfully. \"I had something I wanted to say to you, Nan,\" he remarked after awhile. \"I\u0027ve wanted to say it for a long time. But, honestly, I\u0027m afraid——\" \"Don\u0027t say you are afraid, Gabriel. You used to be afraid; but now I\u0027m the one to be afraid. I mean I should be afraid, but I\u0027m not.\" \"I was feeling very bold when I was mouthing to those people; and every time I looked into your eyes, I said to myself, \u0027You are mine; you are mine! and you know it!\u0027 And I thought all the time that you could hear me. It was a very queer impression. Please don\u0027t make fun of me to-day; wait till to-morrow.\" \"I couldn\u0027t hear you,\" said Nan, \"but I could feel what you said.\" \"That was why you were looking so uneasy,\" remarked Gabriel. \"Perhaps you were angry, too.\" \"No, I was very happy. I didn\u0027t hear your speech, but I knew from the actions of the people around me that it was a good one. But, somehow, I couldn\u0027t hear it. I was thinking of other things. Did you think I was bold to send for you?\" \"Why, I was coming to you anyway,\" said Gabriel. \"Well, if you hadn\u0027t I should have come to you,\" said Nan with a sigh. \"Since I received your letter, I haven\u0027t been myself any more.\" \"Did I send you a letter?\" asked Gabriel. \"No; you wrote part of one,\" answered Nan. \"But that was enough. I found it among your papers. And then when I heard you had been arrested—well, it is all a dream to me. I didn\u0027t know before that one could be perfectly happy and completely miserable at the same time.\" Then, for the first time since he had entered the carriage she looked at him. Her eyes met his, and—well, nothing more was said for some time. Nan had as much as she could do to straighten her hat, and get her hair smoothed out as it should be, so that people wouldn\u0027t know that she and Gabriel were engaged. That was what she said, and she was so cute and lovely, so sweet and gentle that Gabriel threatened to crush the hat and get the hair out of order again. And they were very happy. When they arrived at Shady Dale, Gabriel insisted that Nan go home with him, and he gave what seemed to the young woman a very good reason. \"You know, Nan, my grandmother has been Bethuning me every time I mentioned your name, and I have heard her Bethuning you. We\u0027ll just go in hand in hand and tell her the facts in the case.\" \"Hand in hand, Gabriel? Wouldn\u0027t she think I was very bold?\" \"No, Nan,\" replied Gabriel, very emphatically. \"There are two things my grandmother believes in. She believes in her Bible, and she believes in love.\" \"And she believes in you, Gabriel. Oh, if you only knew how much she loves you!\" cried Nan. They didn\u0027t go in to the dear old lady hand in hand, for when they reached the Lumsden Place, they found Miss Polly Gaither there, and they interrupted her right in the midst of some very interesting gossip. Miss Polly, after greeting Gabriel as cordially as her lonely nature would permit, looked at Nan very critically. There was a question in her eyes, and Nan answered it with a blush. \"I thought as much,\" said Miss Polly, oracularly. \"I declare I believe there\u0027s an epidemic in the town. There\u0027s Pulaski Tomlin, Silas Tomlin, Paul Tomlin, and now Gabriel Tolliver. Well, I wish them well, especially you, Gabriel. Nan is a little frivolous now, but she\u0027ll settle down.\" \"She isn\u0027t frivolous,\" said Gabriel, speaking in the ear-trumpet; \"she is simply young.\" \"Is that the trouble?\" inquired Miss Polly, with a smile, \"well, she\u0027ll soon recover from that.\" And then she turned to Gabriel\u0027s grandmother, and took up the thread of her gossip where it had been broken by the arrival of Nan and Gabriel. \"I declare, Lucy, if anybody had told me, and I couldn\u0027t see for myself, I never would have believed it. Why, Silas Tomlin is a changed man. He looks better than he did twenty-five years ago. He goes about smiling, and while he isn\u0027t handsome—he never could be handsome, you know—he is very pleasant-looking. Yes, he is a changed man. He was going into the house just now as I came out, and he stopped and shook hands with me, and asked about my health, something he never did before. Honestly I don\u0027t know what to make of it; I\u0027m clean put out. Why, the man had two or three quarrels with Ritta Claiborne when she first came here, and now he is going to marry her, or she him—I don\u0027t know which one did the courting, but I\u0027ll never believe it was old Silas. I am really and truly sorry for Ritta Claiborne. We who know Silas Tomlin better than she does ought to warn her of the step she is about to take. I have been on the point of doing so several times; but really, Lucy, I haven\u0027t the heart. She is one of the finest characters I ever knew—she is perfectly lovely. She is all heart, and I am afraid Silas Tomlin has imposed on her in some way. But she is perfectly happy, and so is Silas. If I thought such a thing was possible, I\u0027d say they were very much in love with each other.\" \"Possible!\" cried Gabriel\u0027s grandmother; \"why, love is the only thing worth thinking about in this world. Even the Old Testament is full of it, and there is hardly anything else in the New Testament. Read it, Polly, and you\u0027ll find that all the sacrifice and devotion are based on love—real love, and unselfish because it is real.\" \"It may be so, Lucy; I\u0027ll not deny it,\" and then, after some more gossip less interesting, Miss Polly Gaither took her leave, saying, \"I\u0027ll leave you with your grand-children, Lucy.\" When she was gone, Gabriel stood up and beckoned to Nan, and she went to him without a word. He placed his arm around her, and then called the attention of his grandmother. \"You\u0027ve been Bethuning Nan and me for ever so long, grandmother: what do you think of this?\" \"Why, I think it is very pretty, if it is real. I have known it all along; I mean since the night you were carried away. Nan told me.\" \"Why, Grandmother Lumsden! I never said a word to you about it; I wouldn\u0027t have dared.\" \"I knew it when you came in the door that day—the day that Meriwether Clopton was here. Do you suppose I would have sat by you on the sofa, and held your hand if I had not known it?\" \"I\u0027m glad you knew it,\" said Nan. \"I wanted you to know it, but I didn\u0027t dare to tell you in so many words. I am going home now, Gabriel, and you mustn\u0027t call on me to-day or to-night. I want to be alone. I am so happy,\" she said to Mrs. Lumsden, as she kissed her, \"that I don\u0027t want to talk to any one, not even to Gabriel.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77521.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
