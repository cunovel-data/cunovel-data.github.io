{"id":23587,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER FIFTEEN Silas Tomlin Scents Trouble","content":"One day—it was a warm Saturday, giving promise of a long hot Sunday to follow—Mr. Sanders was on his way home, feeling very blue indeed. He had been to town on no particular business—the day was a half-holiday with the field-hands—and he had wandered about aimlessly, making several unsuccessful efforts to crack a joke or two with such acquaintances as he chanced to meet. He had concluded that his liver was out of order, and he wondered, as he went along, if he would create much public comment and dissatisfaction if he should break his promise to Nan Dorrington by purchasing a jug of liquor and crawling into the nearest shuck-pen. It was on this warm Saturday, the least promising of all days, as he thought, that he stumbled upon an adventure which, for a season, proved to be both interesting and amusing. He was walking along, as has been said, feeling very blue and uncomfortable, when he heard his name called, and, turning around, saw a negro girl running after him. She came up panting and grinning. \"Miss Ritta say she wish you\u0027d come dar right now,\" said the girl. \"I been runnin\u0027 an\u0027 hollin atter you tell I wuz fear\u0027d de dogs \u0027d take atter me. Miss Ritta say she want to see you right now.\" The girl was small and very slim, bare-legged and good-humoured. Mr. Sanders looked at her hard, but failed to recognise her; nor had he the faintest idea as to the identity of \"Miss Ritta.\" The girl bore his scrutiny very well, betraying a tendency to dance. As Mr. Sanders tried in vain to place her in his memory, she slapped her hands together, and whirled quickly on her heel more than once. \"You\u0027re a way yander ahead of me,\" he remarked, after reflecting awhile. \"I reckon I\u0027ve slipped a cog some\u0027rs in my machinery. What is your name?\" \"I\u0027m name Larceeny. Don\u0027t you know me, Marse Billy? I use ter b\u0027long ter de Clopton Cadets, when Miss Nan was de Captain; but I wan\u0027t ez big den ez I is now. I been knowin\u0027 you most sence I was born.\" \"What is your mammy\u0027s name?\" \"My mammy name Creecy,\" replied the girl, grinning broadly. \"She cookin\u0027 fer Miss Ritta.\" Mr. Sanders remembered Creecy very well. She had belonged to the Gaither family before the war. \"Where do you stay?\" he inquired. He was not disposed to admit, even indirectly, that he didn\u0027t know every human being in the town. \"I stays dar wid Miss Ritta,\" replied Larceeny. \"I goes ter de do\u0027, an\u0027 waits on Miss Nugeeny.\" \"Ah!\" exclaimed Mr. Sanders, with a smile of satisfaction. Here was a clew. Miss Nugeeny must be Eugenia Claiborne, and Miss Ritta was probably her mother. \"Miss Ritta say she wanter see you right now,\" insisted Larceeny. \"When she seed you on de street, you wuz so fur, she couldn\u0027t holla at you, an\u0027 time she call me outer de gyarden, you wuz done gone. I wuz at de fur een\u0027 er de gyarden, pickin\u0027 rasbe\u0027ies, an\u0027 I had ter drap ever\u0027thing.\" \"Do you pick raspberries with your mouth?\" inquired Mr. Sanders, with a very solemn air. \"Is my mouf dat red?\" inquired Larceeny, with an alarmed expression on her face. She seized her gingham apron by the hem, and, using the underside, proceeded to remove the incriminating stains, remarking, \"I\u0027m mighty glad you tol\u0027 me, kaze ef ol\u0027 Miss Polly had seed dat—well, she done preach my funer\u0027l once, an\u0027 I don\u0027t want ter hear it no mo\u0027.\" Mr. Sanders, following Larceeny, proceeded to the Gaither Place, and was ushered into the parlour, where, to his surprise, he found Judge Vardeman, of Rockville, one of the most distinguished lawyers of the State. Mr. Sanders knew the Judge very well, and admired him not only on account of his great ability as a lawyer, but because of the genial simplicity of his character. They greeted each other very cordially, and were beginning to discuss the situation—it was the one topic that never grew stale during that sad time—when Mrs. Claiborne came in; she had evidently been out to attend to some household affairs. \"I\u0027m very glad to see you, Mr. Sanders,\" she said. \"I have sent for you at the suggestion of Judge Vardeman, who is a kinsman of mine by marriage. He is surprised that you and I are not well acquainted; but I tell him that in such sad times as these, it is a wonder that one knows one\u0027s next-door neighbours.\" Mr. Sanders made some fitting response, and as soon as he could do so without rudeness, closely studied the countenance of the lady. There was a vivacity, a gaiety, an archness in her manner that he found very charming. Her features were not regular, but when she laughed or smiled, her face was beautiful. If she had ever experienced any serious trouble, Mr. Sanders thought, she had been able to bear it bravely, for no marks of it were left on her speaking countenance. \"Give me a firm faith and a light heart,\" says an ancient writer, \"and the world may have everything else.\" \"I have sent for you, Mr. Sanders,\" said the lady, laughing lightly, \"to ask if you will undertake to be my drummer.\" \"Your drummer!\" exclaimed Mr. Sanders. \"Well, I\u0027ve been told that I have a way of blowin\u0027 my own horn, when the weather is fine and the spring sap is runnin\u0027, but as for drummin\u0027, I reely hain\u0027t got the knack on it.\" \"Oh, I only want you to do a little talking here and there, and give out various hints and intimations—you know what I mean. I am anxious to even up matters with a friend of yours, who, I am afraid, isn\u0027t any better than he should be.\" While the lady was talking, Mr. Sanders was staring at a couple of crayon portraits on the wall. He rose from his seat, walked across the room, and attentively studied one of the portraits. It depicted a man between twenty-five and thirty-five. \"Well, I\u0027ll be jigged!\" he exclaimed as he resumed his seat. \"Ef that ain\u0027t Silas Tomlin I\u0027m a Dutchman!\" \"Why, I shouldn\u0027t think you would recognise him after all these years,\" the lady said, smiling brightly. \"Don\u0027t you think the portrait flatters him?\" \"Quite a considerbul,\" replied Mr. Sanders; \"but Silas has got p\u0027ints about his countenance that a coat of tar wouldn\u0027t hide. Trim his eyebrows, an\u0027 give him a clean, close shave, an\u0027 he\u0027s e\u0027en about the same as he was then. An\u0027 ef I ain\u0027t mighty much mistaken, the pictur\u0027 by his side was intended to be took for you. The feller that took it forgot to put the right kind of a sparkle in the eye, an\u0027 he didn\u0027t ketch the laugh that oughter be hov\u0027rin\u0027 round the mouth, like a butterfly tryin\u0027 to light on a pink rose; but all in all, it\u0027s a mighty good likeness.\" \"Now, don\u0027t you think I should thank Mr. Sanders?\" said the lady, turning to Judge Vardeman. \"It has been many a day since I have had such a compliment. Actually, I believe I am blushing!\" and she was. \"It wasn\u0027t much of a compliment to the artist,\" the Judge suggested. \"Well, when it comes to paintin\u0027 a purty \u0027oman,\" remarked Mr. Sanders, \"it\u0027s powerful hard for to git in all the p\u0027ints. A feller could paint our picturs in short order, Judge. A couple of kags of pink paint, a whitewash brush, an\u0027 two or three strokes, bold an\u0027 free, would do the business.\" The Judge\u0027s eye twinkled merrily, and Mrs. Claiborne laughingly exclaimed, \"Why, you\u0027d make quite an artist. You certainly have an eye for colour.\" Thereupon Judge Vardeman suggested to Mrs. Claiborne that she begin at the beginning, and place Mr. Sanders in possession of all the facts necessary to the successful carrying out of the plan she had in view. It was a plan, the Judge went on to say, that he did not wholly indorse, bordering, as it did, on frivolity, but as the lady was determined on it, he would not advise against it, as the results bade fair to be harmless. It must have been quite a story the lady had to tell Mr. Sanders, for the sun was nearly down when he came from the house; and it must have been somewhat amusing, too, for he came down the steps laughing heartily. When he reached the sidewalk, he paused, looked back at the closed door, shook his head, and threw up his hands, exclaiming to himself, \"Bless Katy! I\u0027m powerful glad I ain\u0027t got no \u0027oman on my trail. \u0027Specially one like her. Be jigged ef she don\u0027t shake this old town up!\" He heard voices behind him, and turned to see Eugenia Claiborne and Paul Tomlin walking slowly along, engaged in a very engrossing conversation. Mr. Sanders looked at the couple long enough to make sure that he was not mistaken as to their identity, and then he went on his way. He had intended to go straight home, but, yielding to a sudden whim or impulse, he went to the tavern instead. This old tavern, at a certain hour of the day, was the resort of all the men, old and young, who desired to indulge in idle gossip, or hear the latest news that might be brought by some stray traveller, or commercial agent, or cotton-buyer from Malvern. For years, Mr. Woodruff, the proprietor—he had come from Vermont in the forties, as a school-teacher—complained that the hospitality of the citizens was enough to ruin any public-house that had no gold mine to draw upon. But, after the war, the tide, such as it was, turned in his favour, and by the early part of 1868, he was beginning to profit by what he called \"a pretty good line of custom,\" and there were days in the busy season when he was hard put to it to accommodate his guests in the way he desired. During the spring and summer months, there was no pleasanter place than the long, low veranda of Mr. Woodruff\u0027s tavern, and it was very popular with those who had an idle hour at their disposal. This veranda was much patronised by Mr. Silas Tomlin, who, after the death of his wife, had no home-life worthy of the name. Silas was not socially inclined; he took no part in the gossip and tittle-tattle that flowed up and down the veranda. The most interesting bit of news never caused him to turn his head, and the raciest anecdote failed to bring a smile to his face. Nevertheless, nothing seemed to please him better than to draw a chair some distance away from the group of loungers, yet not out of ear-shot, lean back against one of the supporting pillars, close his eyes and listen to all that was said, or dream his own dreams, such as they might be. Mr. Sanders was well aware of Silas Tomlin\u0027s tavern habits, and this was what induced him to turn his feet in that direction. He expected to find Silas there at this particular hour and he was not disappointed. Silas was sitting aloof from the crowd, his chair leaning against one of the columns, his legs crossed, his eyes closed, and his hands folded in his lap. But for an occasional nervous movement of his thin lips, and the twitching of his thumbs, he might have served as a model for a statue of Repose. As a matter of fact, all his faculties were alert. The crowd of loungers was somewhat larger than usual, having been augmented during the day by three commercial agents and a couple of cotton-buyers. Lawyer Tidwell was taking advantage of the occasion to expound and explain several very delicate and intricate constitutional problems. Mr. Tidwell was a very able man in some respects, and he was a very good talker, although he wanted to do all the talking himself. He lowered his voice slightly, as he saw Mr. Sanders, but kept on with his exposition of our organic law. \"Hello, Mr. Sanders!\" said one of the cotton-buyers, taking advantage of a momentary pause in Mr. Tidwell\u0027s monologue; \"how are you getting on these days?\" \"Well, I was gittin\u0027 on right peart tell to-day, but this mornin\u0027 I struck a job that\u0027s made me weak an\u0027 w\u0027ary.\" \"You\u0027re looking mighty well, anyhow. What has been the trouble to-day?\" \"Why, I\u0027ll tell you,\" responded Mr. Sanders, with a show of animation. \"I\u0027ve been gwine round all day tryin\u0027 to git up subscriptions for to build a flatform for Gus Tidwell. Gus needs a place whar he can stand an\u0027 explutterate on the Constitution all day, and not be in nobody\u0027s way.\" \"Well, of course you succeeded,\" remarked Mr. Tidwell, good-naturedly. \"Middlin\u0027 well—middlin\u0027 well. A coloured lady flung a dime in the box, an\u0027 I put in a quarter. In all, I reckon I\u0027ve raised a dollar an\u0027 a half. But I reely believe I could \u0027a\u0027 raised a hunderd dollars ef I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 told \u0027em whar the flatform was to be built.\" \"Where is that?\" some one inquired. \"In the pine-thicket behind the graveyard,\" responded Mr. Sanders, so earnestly and promptly that the crowd shouted with laughter. Even Mr. Tidwell, who was \"case-hardened,\" as Mrs. Absalom would say, to Mr. Sanders\u0027s jokes, joined in with the rest. \"Gus is a purty good lawyer,\" said Mr. Sanders, lifting his voice a little to make sure that Silas Tomlin would hear every syllable of what he intended to say; \"but he\u0027ll never be at his best till he finds out that the Constitution, like the Bible, can be translated to suit the idees of any party or any crank. But I allers brag on Gus because I believe in paternizin\u0027 home industries. Howsomever, between us boys an\u0027 gals, an\u0027 not aimin\u0027 for it to go any furder, there\u0027s a lawyer in town to-day—an\u0027 maybe he\u0027ll be here to-morrow—who knows more about the law in one minnit than Gus could tell you in a day and a half. An\u0027 when it comes to explutterations on p\u0027ints of constitutional law, Gus wouldn\u0027t be in it.\" \"Is that so? What is the gentleman\u0027s name?\" asked Mr. Tidwell. \"Judge Albert Vardeman,\" replied Mr. Sanders. \"Now, when you come to talk about lawyers, you\u0027ll be doin\u0027 yourself injustice ef you leave out the name of Albert Vardeman. He ain\u0027t got much of a figure—he\u0027s shaped somethin\u0027 like a gourdful of water—but I tell you he\u0027s got a head on him.\" \"Is the Judge really here?\" Mr. Tidwell asked. \"I\u0027d like very much to have a talk with him.\" \"I don\u0027t blame you, Gus,\" remarked Mr. Sanders, \"you can git more straight p\u0027ints from Albert Vardeman than you\u0027ll find in the books. He\u0027s been at Mrs. Claiborne\u0027s all day; I reckon she\u0027s gittin\u0027 him to ten\u0027 to some law business for her. They\u0027s some kinder kinnery betwixt \u0027em. His mammy\u0027s cat ketched a rat in her gran\u0027mammy\u0027s smokehouse, I reckon. We\u0027ve got more kinfolks in these diggin\u0027s, than they has been sence the first generation arter Adam.\" At the mention of Mrs. Claiborne\u0027s name Silas Tomlin opened his eyes and uncrossed his legs. This movement caused him to lose his balance, and his chair fell from a leaning position with a sharp bang. \"What sort of a dream did you have, Silas?\" Mr. Sanders inquired with affected solicitude. \"You\u0027d better watch out; Dock Dorrin\u0027ton says that when a man gits bald-headed, it\u0027s a sign that his bones is as brittle as glass. He found that out on one of his furrin trips.\" \"Don\u0027t worry about me, Sanders,\" replied Silas. He tried to smile. \"Well, I don\u0027t reckon you could call it worry, Silas, bekaze when I ketch a case of the worries, it allers sends me to bed wi\u0027 the jimmyjon. I can be neighbourly wi\u0027out worryin\u0027, I hope.\" \"For a woman with a grown daughter,\" remarked Mr. Tidwell, speaking his thoughts aloud, as was his habit, \"Mrs. Claiborne is well preserved—very well preserved.\" Mr. Tidwell was a widower, of several years\u0027 standing. \"Why, she\u0027s not only preserved, she\u0027s the preserves an\u0027 the preserver,\" Mr. Sanders declared. \"To look in her eye an\u0027 watch her thoughts sparklin\u0027 like fire, to watch her movements, an\u0027 hear her laugh, not only makes a feller young agin, but makes him glad he\u0027s a-livin\u0027. An\u0027 that gal of her\u0027n—well, she\u0027s a thoroughbred. Did you ever notice the way she holds her head? I never see her an\u0027 Nan Dorrington together but what I\u0027m sorry I never got married. I\u0027d put up wi\u0027 all the tribulation for to have a gal like arry one on \u0027em.\" Mr. Sanders paused a moment, and then turned to Silas Tomlin. \"Silas, I think Paul is fixin\u0027 for to do you proud. As I come along jest now, him an\u0027 Jinny Claiborne was walkin\u0027 mighty close together. They must \u0027a\u0027 been swappin\u0027 some mighty sweet secrets, bekaze they hardly spoke above a whisper. An\u0027 they didn\u0027t look like they was in much of a hurry.\" While Mr. Sanders was describing the scene he had witnessed, exaggerating the facts to suit his whimsical humour, Silas Tomlin sat bold upright in his chair, his eyes half-shut, and his thin lips working nervously. \"Paul knows which side his bread is buttered on,\" he snapped out. \"Bread!\" exclaimed Mr. Sanders, pretending to become tremendously excited; \"bread! shorely you must mean poun\u0027-cake, Silas. And whoever heard of putting butter on poun\u0027-cake?\" When the loungers began to disperse, some of them going home, and others going in to supper in response to the tavern bell, Mr. Silas Tomlin called to Lawyer Tidwell, and the two walked along together, their homes lying in the same direction. \"Gus,\" said Silas, somewhat nervously, \"I want to put a case to you. It\u0027s purely imaginary, and has probably never happened in the history of the world.\" \"You mean what we lawyers call a hypothetical case,\" remarked Mr. Tidwell, in a tone that suggested a spacious and a tolerant mind. \"Precisely,\" replied Mr. Silas Tomlin, with some eagerness. \"I was readin\u0027 a tale in an old copy of Blackwood\u0027s Magazine the other day, an\u0027 the whole business turned on just such a case. The sum and substance of it was about this: A man marries a woman and they get along together all right for awhile. Then, all of a sudden she takes a mortal dislike to the man, screams like mad when he goes about her, and kicks up generally when his name is mentioned. He, being a man of some spirit, and rather touchy at best, finally leaves her in disgust. Finally her folks send him word that she is dead. On the strength of that information, he marries again, after so long a time. All goes well for eighteen or twenty years, and then suddenly the first wife turns up. Now what, in law, is the man\u0027s status? Where does he stand? Is this woman really his wife?\" \"Why, certainly,\" replied Mr. Tidwell. \"His second marriage is no marriage at all. The issue of such a marriage is illegitimate.\" \"That\u0027s just what I thought,\" commented Silas Tomlin. \"But in the tale, when the woman comes back, and puts in her claim, the judge flings her case out of court.\" \"That was in England,\" Mr. Tidwell suggested. \"Or Scotland—I forget which,\" Silas Tomlin replied. \"Well, it isn\u0027t the law over here,\" Mr. Tidwell declared confidently. They walked on a little way, when the lawyer suddenly turned to Silas and said: \"Mr. Tomlin, will you fetch that magazine in to-morrow? I want to see the ground on which the woman\u0027s case was thrown out. It\u0027s interesting, even if it is all fiction. Perhaps there was some technicality.\" \"All right, Gus; I\u0027ll fetch it in to-morrow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77502.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
