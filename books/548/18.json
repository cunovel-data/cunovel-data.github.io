{"id":23589,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER SEVENTEEN Rhody Has Something to Say","content":"Now, all this time, while the mother was engaged with Silas, Eugenia, the daughter, was having an experience of her own. When Rhody, Silas Tomlin\u0027s cook and housekeeper, discovered that Paul had left the house in a fit of anger, she knew at once that something unusual had occurred, and her indignation against Silas Tomlin rose high. She was familiar with every peculiarity of Paul\u0027s character, and she was well aware of the fact that behind his calm and cool bearing, which nothing ever seemed to ruffle, was a heart as sensitive and as tender as that of a woman, and a temper hot, obstinate and unreasonable when aroused. So, without taking time to serve Silas\u0027s supper, she went in search of Paul. She went to the store where he was the chief clerk, but the doors were closed; she went to the tavern, but he was not to be seen; and she walked along the principal streets, where sometimes the young men strolled after tea. There she met a negro woman, who suggested that he might be at the Gaither Place. \"Humph!\" snorted Rhody, \"how come dat ain\u0027t cross my mind? But ef he\u0027s dar dis night, ef he run ter dat gal when he in trouble, I better be layin\u0027 off ter cook some weddin\u0027 doin\u0027s.\" There wasn\u0027t a backyard in the town that Rhody didn\u0027t know as well as she knew her own, and she stood on no ceremony in entering any of them. She went to the Gaither Place, swung back the gate, shutting it after her with a bang, and stalked into the kitchen as though it belonged to her. At the moment there was no one in sight but Mandy, the house-girl, a bright and good-looking mulatto. \"Why, howdy, Miss Rhody!\" she exclaimed, in a voice that sounded like a flute. \"What wind blowed you in here?\" \"Put down dem dishes an\u0027 wipe yo\u0027 han\u0027s,\" said Rhody, by way of reply. The girl silently complied, expressing no surprise and betraying no curiosity. \"Now, den, go in de house, an\u0027 ax ef Paul Tomlin is in dar,\" commanded Rhody. \"Ef he is des tell \u0027im dat Mammy Rhody want ter see \u0027im.\" \"I hope dey ain\u0027t nobody dead,\" suggested Mandy with a musical laugh. \"I\u0027m lookin\u0027 out for all sorts er trouble, because I\u0027ve had mighty funny dreams for three nights han\u0027-runnin\u0027. Look like I can see blood. I wake up, I do, cryin\u0027 an\u0027 feelin\u0027 tired out like de witches been ridin\u0027 me. Then I drop off to sleep, an\u0027 there\u0027s the blood, plain as my han\u0027.\" She went on in the house and Rhody followed close at her heels. She was determined to see Paul if she could. She was very willing for Silas Tomlin to be drawn through a hackle; she was willing to see murder done if the whites were to be the victims; but Paul—well, according to her view, Paul was one of a thousand. She had given him suck; she had fretted and worried about him for twenty years; and she couldn\u0027t break off her old habits all at once. She had listened to and indorsed the incendiary doctrines of the radical emissary who pretended to be representing the government; she had wept and shouted over the strenuous pleadings of the Rev. Jeremiah; but all these things were wholly apart from Paul. And if she had had the remotest idea that they affected his interests or his future, she would have risen in the church and denounced the carpet-bagger and his scalawag associates, and likewise the Rev. Jeremiah. When Mandy, closely followed by Rhody, went into the house, she heard voices in the parlour, but Eugenia was in the sitting-room reading by the light of a lamp. \"Miss Genia,\" said the girl, \"is Mr. Paul here?\" \"Why do you ask?\" inquired Eugenia. \"They-all cook wanter speak with him.\" At this moment, Eugenia saw the somewhat grim face of Rhody peering over the girl\u0027s shoulder. \"Paul isn\u0027t here,\" said the young lady, rising with a vague feeling of alarm. \"What is the matter?\" And then, feeling that if there was any trouble, Rhody would feel freer to speak when they were alone together, Eugenia dismissed Mandy, and followed to see that the girl went out. \"Now, what is the trouble, Rhody? Mr. Silas Tomlin is in the parlour talking to mother.\" Rhody opened her eyes wide at this. \"He in dar? What de name er goodness he doin\u0027 here?\" Eugenia didn\u0027t know, of course, and said so. \"Well, he ain\u0027t atter no good,\" Rhody went on; \"you kin put dat down in black an\u0027 white. Dat man is sho\u0027 ter leave a smutty track wharsomever he walk at. You better watch \u0027im; you better keep yo\u0027 eye on \u0027im. Is he yever loant yo\u0027 ma any money?\" \"Why, no,\" replied Eugenia, laughing at the absurdity of the question. \"What put that idea in your head?\" \"Bekaze dat\u0027s his business—loanin\u0027 out a little dab er money here an\u0027 a little dab dar, an\u0027 gittin\u0027 back double de dab he loant,\" said Rhody. \"Deyer folks in dis county, which he loant um money, an\u0027 now he got all de prop\u0027ty dey yever had; an\u0027 deyer folks right here in dis town, which he loant um dat ar Conferick money when it want wuff much mo dan shavin\u0027s, an\u0027 now dey got ter pay \u0027im back sho nuff money. I hear \u0027im sesso. Oh, dat\u0027s him! dat\u0027s Silas Tomlin up an\u0027 down. You kin take a thrip an\u0027 squeeze it in yo\u0027 han\u0027 tell it leave a print, an\u0027 hol\u0027 it up whar folks kin see it, an\u0027 dar you got his pictur\u0027; all it\u0027ll need will be a frame. He done druv Paul \u0027way fum home.\" She spoke with some heat, and really went further than she intended, but she was swept away by her indignation. She was certain, knowing Paul as well as she did, that he had left the house in a fit of anger at something his father had said or done and she was equally as certain that he would have to be coaxed back. \"Surely you are mistaken,\" said Eugenia. \"It is too ridiculous. Why, Paul—Mr. Paul is——\" She paused and stood there blushing. \"Go on, chile: say it out; don\u0027t be shame er me. Nobody can\u0027t say nothin\u0027 good \u0027bout dat boy but what I kin put a lots mo\u0027 on what dey er tellin\u0027. Silas Tomlin done tol\u0027 me out\u0027n his own mouf dat Paul went fum de house vowin\u0027 he\u0027d never come back.\" Eugenia was so sure that Rhody (after her kind and colour) was exaggerating, that she refused to be disturbed by the statement. \"Why did you come here hunting for Paul?\" the young lady asked. \"Oh, go away, Miss Genia!\" exclaimed Rhody, laughing. \"\u0027Tain\u0027t no needs er my answerin\u0027 dat, kaze you know lots better\u0027n I does.\" \"Are you very fond of him?\" Eugenia inquired. \"Who—me? Why, honey, I raised \u0027im. Sick er well, I nussed \u0027im fer long years. I helt \u0027im in deze arms nights an\u0027 nights, when all he had ter do fer ter leave dis vale wuz ter fetch one gasp an\u0027 go. Ef his daddy had done all dat, he wouldn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 druv de boy fum home.\" Alas! how could Rhody, in her ignorance and blindness, probe the recesses of a soul as reticent as that of Silas Tomlin? \"Oh, don\u0027t say he was driven from home!\" cried Eugenia, rising and placing a hand on Rhody\u0027s arm. \"If you talk that way, other people will take it up, and it won\u0027t be pleasant for Paul.\" \"Dat sho is a mighty purty han\u0027,\" exclaimed Rhody enthusiastically, ignoring the grave advice of the young woman. \"I\u0027m gwine ter show somebody de place whar you laid it, an\u0027 I bet you he\u0027ll wanter cut de cloff out an\u0027 put it in his alvum.\" Eugenia made a pretence of pushing Rhody out of the room, but she was blushing and smiling. \"Well\u0027m, he ain\u0027t here, sho, an\u0027 here\u0027s whar he oughter be; but I\u0027ll fin\u0027 \u0027im dis night an\u0027 ef he ain\u0027t gwine back home, I ain\u0027t gwine back—you kin put dat down.\" With that, she bade the young lady good-night, and went out. As Rhody passed through the back gate, she chanced to glance toward Pulaski Tomlin\u0027s house, and saw a light shining from the library window. \"Ah-yi!\" she exclaimed, \"he\u0027s dar, an\u0027 dey ain\u0027t no better place fer \u0027im. Dey\u0027s mo\u0027 home fer \u0027im right dar den dey yever wus er yever will be whar he live at.\" So saying, she turned her steps in the direction of Neighbour Tomlin\u0027s. In the kitchen, she asked if Paul was in the house. The cook didn\u0027t know, but when the house-girl came out, she said that Mr. Paul was there, and had been for some time. \"Deyer holdin\u0027 a reg\u0027lar expeunce meetin\u0027 in dar,\" she said. \"Miss Fanny sho is a plum sight!\" The house-girl went in again to say that Rhody would like to speak with him, and Rhody, as was her custom, followed at her heels. \"Come in, Rhody,\" said Miss Fanny. \"I know you are there. You always send a message, and then go along with it to see if it is delivered correctly. \u0027Twould save a great deal of trouble if the rest of us were to adopt your plan.\" \"I hope you all is well,\" remarked Rhody, as she made her appearance. \"I declar\u0027, Miss Fanny, you look good enough to eat.\" \"Well, I do eat,\" responded Miss Fanny, teasingly. \"I mean you look good enough ter be etted,\" said Rhody, correcting herself. \"Now, that is what I call a nice compliment,\" Miss Fanny observed complacently. \"Brother Pulaski, if I am ever \u0027etted\u0027 you won\u0027t have to raise a monument to my memory.\" \"No wonder you look young,\" laughed Rhody. \"Anybody what kin git fun out\u0027n a graveyard is bleeze ter look young.\" Paul was lying on the wide lounge that was one of the features of the library. His eyes were closed, and his Aunt Fanny was gently stroking his hair. Pulaski Tomlin leaned back in an easy chair, lazily enjoying a cigar, the delicate flavour of which filled the room. There was something serene and restful in the group, in the furniture, in all the accessories and surroundings. The negro woman turned around and looked at everything in the room, as if trying to discover what produced the effect of perfect repose. It is the rule that everything beautiful and precious in this world should have mystery attached to it. There is the enduring mystery of art, the mystery that endows plain flesh and blood with genius. A little child draws you by its beauty; there is mystery unfathomable in its eyes. You enter a home, no matter how fine, no matter how humble; it may be built of logs, and its furnishings may be of the poorest; but if it is a home, a real home, you will know it unmistakably the moment you step across the threshold. Some subtle essence, as mysterious as thought itself, will find its way to your mind and enlighten your instinct. You will know, however fine the dwelling, whether the spirit of home dwells there. Rhody, as she looked around in the vain effort to get a clew to the secret, wondered why she always felt so comfortable in this house. She sighed as she seated herself on the floor at the foot of the lounge on which Paul lay. This was her privilege. If Miss Fanny could sit at his head, Rhody could sit at his feet. \"You wanted to speak to Paul,\" suggested Miss Fanny. \"Yes\u0027m; he lef\u0027 de house in a huff, an\u0027 I wanter know ef he gwine back—kaze ef he ain\u0027t, I\u0027m gwineter move way fum dar. He ain\u0027t take time fer ter git his supper.\" \"Why, Paul!\" exclaimed Miss Fanny. \"I couldn\u0027t eat a mouthful to save my life,\" said Paul. \"Whar Miss Margaret?\" Rhody inquired; and she seemed pleased to hear that the young lady was spending the night with Nan Dorrington. \"Honey,\" she said to Paul, \"how come yo\u0027 pa went ter de Gaither Place ter-night? What business he got dar?\" This was news to Paul, and he could make no reply to Rhody\u0027s question. He reflected over the matter a little while. \"Was he really there?\" he asked finally. \"I hear \u0027im talkin\u0027 in de parlour, an\u0027 Miss Genia say it\u0027s him.\" \"What were you doing there?\" inquired Miss Fanny, pushing her jaunty grey curls behind her ears. \"A coloured \u0027oman recommen\u0027 me ter go dar ef I wan\u0027 ter fin\u0027 dat chile.\" \"Why, Paul! And is the wind really blowing in that quarter?\" cried Miss Fanny, leaning over and kissing him on the forehead. \"Now, Mammy Rhody, why did you do that?\" Paul asked with considerable irritation. \"What will Miss Eugenia and her mother think?\" He sat bolt upright on the sofa. \"Well, her ma ain\u0027t see me, an\u0027 Miss Genia look like she wuz sorry I couldn\u0027t fin\u0027 you dar.\" Miss Fanny laughed, but Rhody was perfectly serious. \"Miss Fanny,\" she said, turning to the lady, \"how come dat chile lef\u0027 home?\" \"Shall I tell her, Paul? I may as well.\" Whereupon she told the negro woman the cause of Paul\u0027s anger, and ended by saying that she didn\u0027t blame him for showing the spirit of a Southern gentleman. \"Well, he\u0027ll never j\u0027ine de \u0027Publican Party in dis county,\" Rhody declared emphatically. \"He will if he has made up his mind to do so. You don\u0027t know Silas,\" said Miss Fanny. \"Who—me? Me not know dat man? Huh! I know \u0027im better\u0027n he know hisse\u0027f; an\u0027 I know some yuther folks, too. I tell you right now, he\u0027ll never j\u0027ine; an\u0027 ef you don\u0027t believe me, you wait an\u0027 see. Time I git thoo wid his kaycter, de \u0027Publicans won\u0027t tetch \u0027im wid a ten-foot pole.\" \"I hope you are right,\" said Pulaski Tomlin, speaking for the first time. \"There\u0027s enough trouble in the land without having a scalawag in the Tomlin family.\" \"Well, you nee\u0027nter worry \u0027bout dat, kaze I\u0027ll sho put a stop ter dem kinder doin\u0027s. Honey,\" Rhody went on, addressing Paul, \"you come on home when you git sleepy; I\u0027m gwineter set up fer you, an\u0027 ef you don\u0027t come, yo\u0027 pa\u0027ll hatter cook his own vittles ter-morrer mornin\u0027.\" \"Good-night, Rhody, and pleasant dreams,\" said Miss Fanny, as the negro woman started out. \"I dunner how anybody kin have pleasin\u0027 drams ef dey sleep in de same lot wid Marse Silas,\" replied Rhody. \"Good-night all.\" Now, the cook at the Tomlin Place was the wife of the Rev. Jeremiah. She was a tall, thin woman, some years older than her husband, and she ruled him with a rod of iron. The new conditions, combined with the insidious flattery of the white radicals, had made her vicious against the whites. Rhody knew this, and from the \"big house,\" she went into the kitchen, where Mrs. Jeremiah was cleaning up for the night. Her name was Patsy. \"You gittin\u0027 mighty thick wid de white folks, Sis\u0027 Rhody,\" said Patsy, pausing in her work, as the other entered the door. For answer, Rhody fell into a chair, held both hands high above her head, and then let them drop in her lap. The gesture was effective for a dozen interpretations. \"Well!\" she exclaimed, and then paused, Patsy watching her narrowly the while. \"I dunner how \u0027tis wid you, Sis\u0027 Patsy, but wid me, it\u0027s live an\u0027 l\u0027arn—live an\u0027 l\u0027arn. An\u0027 I\u0027m a-larnin\u0027, mon, spite er de fack dat de white folks think niggers ain\u0027t got no sense.\" \"Dey does! Dey does!\" exclaimed Patsy. \"Dey got de idee dat we all ain\u0027t got no mo\u0027 sense dan a passel er fryin\u0027-size chickens. But dey\u0027ll fin\u0027 out better, an\u0027 den—Ah-h-h!\" This last exclamation was a hoarse gutteral cry of triumph. \"You sho is talkin\u0027 now!\" cried Rhody, with an admiring smile. \"I knows it ter-night, ef I never is know\u0027d it befo\u0027.\" Patsy knew that some disclosure was coming, and she invited it by putting Rhody on the defensive. \"It\u0027s de trufe,\" she declared. \"Dat what make me feel so quare, Sis\u0027 Rhody, when I see you so ready fer ter collogue wid de white folks. I wuz talkin\u0027 wid Jerry \u0027bout it no longer\u0027n las\u0027 night. Yes\u0027m, I wuz. I say, \u0027Jerry, what de matter wid Sis\u0027 Rhody?\u0027 He say, \u0027Which away, Pidgin?\u0027—desso; he allers call me Pidgin,\" explained Patsy, with a smile of pride. \"I say, \u0027By de way she colloguin\u0027 wid de white folks.\u0027\" \"What Br\u0027er Jerry say ter dat?\" inquired Rhody. \"He des shuck his head an\u0027 groan,\" was the reply. Rhody leaned forward with a frown that was almost tragic in its heaviness, and spoke in a deep, unnatural tone that added immensely to the emphasis of her words. \"\u0027Oman, lemme tell you: I done it, an\u0027 I\u0027m glad I done it; an\u0027 you\u0027ll be glad I done it; an\u0027 he\u0027ll be glad I done it.\" Patsy was drying the dish-pan with a towel, but suspended operations the better to hear what Rhody had to say. \"Dey done got it fixt up fer ol\u0027 Silas ter j\u0027ine in wid de \u0027Publican Party. He gwineter j\u0027ine so he kin fin\u0027 out all der doin\u0027s, an\u0027 all der comin\u0027s an\u0027 der gwines, so he kin tell de yuthers.\" \"Huh! Oh, yes—yes, yes, yes! Oh, yes! We er fools; we ain\u0027t got no sense!\" cackled Patsy viciously. \"He des gwineter make out he\u0027s a \u0027Publican,\" Rhody went on; \"dey got it all planned. He gwineter j\u0027ine de Nunion League, an\u0027 git all de names. Dey talk \u0027bout it, Sis\u0027 Patsy, right befo\u0027 my face an\u0027 eyes. Dey mus\u0027 take me fer a start-natchel fool.\" \"Dey does—dey does!\" cried Patsy; \"dey takes us all fer fools. But won\u0027t dey be a wakin\u0027 up when de time come?\" Then and there was given the death-blow to Silas Tomlin\u0027s ambition to become a Republican politician. The Rev. Jeremiah was apprised of the plan, which so far as Rhody was concerned, was a pure invention. Word went round, and when Silas put in his application to become a member of the union League, he was informed that orders had come from Atlanta that no more members were to be enrolled. When Rhody went out into the street, after her talk with Patsy, a passer-by would have said that her actions were very queer. She leaned against the fence and went into convulsions of silent laughter. \"Oh, I wish I wuz some\u0027rs whar I could holler,\" she said aloud between gasps. \"He calls her \u0027Pidgin!\u0027 Pidgin! Ef she\u0027s a pidgin, I\u0027d like ter know what gone wid de cranes!\" She recurred to this name some weeks afterward, when the Rev. Jeremiah informed her confidentially that his wife had discovered Silas Tomlin\u0027s plan to unearth the secrets of the union League. Rhody\u0027s comment somewhat surprised the Rev. Jeremiah. \"I allers thought,\" she said with a laugh, \"dat Pidgin had sump\u0027n else in her craw \u0027sides corn.\" Rhody waited in the kitchen that night until Paul returned, and then she went to bed. Silas and his son were up earlier than usual the next morning, but they found breakfast ready and waiting. The attitude of father and son toward each other was constrained and reserved. Silas felt that he must certainly say something to Paul about Eugenia Claiborne. He hardly knew how to begin, but at last he plunged into the subject with the same shivering sense of fear displayed by a small boy who is about to jump into a pond of cold water—dreading it, and yet determined to take a header. \"I hear, Paul,\" he began, \"that you are very attentive to Eugenia Claiborne.\" \"I call on her occasionally,\" said Paul. \"She is a very agreeable young lady.\" He spoke coolly, but the blood mounted to his face. \"So I hear—so I hear,\" remarked Silas in a business-like way. \"Still, I hope you won\u0027t carry matters too far.\" \"What do you mean?\" Paul inquired. \"I wish I could go into particulars; I wish I could tell you exactly what I mean, but I can\u0027t,\" said Silas. \"All I can say is that it would be impossible for you to marry the young woman. My Lord!\" he exclaimed, as he saw Paul close his jaws together. \"Ain\u0027t there no other woman in the world?\" \"Do you know anything against the young lady\u0027s character?\" the son asked. \"Nothing, absolutely nothing,\" was the response. \"Well,\" said Paul, \"I hadn\u0027t considered the question of marriage at all, but since you\u0027ve brought the subject up, we may as well discuss it. You say it will be impossible for me to marry this young lady, and you refuse to tell me why. Don\u0027t you think I am old enough to be trusted?\" \"Why, certainly, Paul—of course; but there are some things—\" Silas paused, and caught his breath, and then went on. \"Honestly, Paul, if I could tell you, I would; I\u0027d be glad to tell you; but this is a matter in which you will have to depend on my judgment. Can\u0027t you trust me?\" \"Just as far as you can trust me, but no farther,\" was the reply. \"I\u0027m not a child. In a few months I\u0027ll be of age. But if I were only ten years old, and knew the young lady as well as I know her now, you couldn\u0027t turn me against her by insinuations.\" He rose, shook himself, walked the length of the room and back again, and stood close to his father. \"You\u0027ve already settled the question of marriage. I asked you last night about the report that you intended to act with the radicals, and you refused to give me a direct answer. That means that the report is true. Do you suppose that Eugenia Claiborne, or any other decent woman would marry the son of a scalawag?\" he asked with a voice full of passion. \"Why, she\u0027d spit in his face, and I wouldn\u0027t blame her.\" The young man went out, leaving Silas sitting at the table. \"Lord! I hate to hurt him, but he\u0027d better be dead than to marry that girl.\" Rhody, who was standing in the entryway leading from the dining-room to the kitchen, and who had overheard every word that passed between father and son, entered the room at this moment, exclaiming: \"Well, you des ez well call \u0027im dead den, kaze marry her he will, an\u0027 I don\u0027t blame \u0027im; an\u0027 mo\u0027n dat I\u0027ll he\u0027p \u0027im all I can.\" \"You don\u0027t know what you are talking about,\" said Silas, wiping his lips, which were as dry as a bone. \"Maybe I does, an\u0027 maybe I don\u0027t,\" replied Rhody. \"But what I does know, I knows des ez good ez anybody. You say dat boy sha\u0027n\u0027t marry de gal; but how come you courtin\u0027 de mammy?\" \"Doing what?\" cried Silas, pushing his chair back from the table. \"Courtin\u0027 de mammy,\" answered Rhody, in a loud voice. \"You wuz dar las\u0027 night, an\u0027 fer all I know you wuz dar de night befo\u0027, an\u0027 de night \u0027fo\u0027 dat. You may fool some folks, but you can\u0027t fool me.\" \"Courting! Why you blasted idiot! I went to see her on business.\" Rhody laughed so heartily that few would have detected the mockery in it. \"Business! Yasser; it\u0027s business, an\u0027 mighty funny business. Well, ef you kin git her, you take her. Ef she don\u0027t lead you a dance, I ain\u0027t name Rhody.\" \"I believe you\u0027ve lost what little sense you used to have,\" said Silas with angry contempt. \"I notice dat nobody roun\u0027 here ain\u0027t foun\u0027 it,\" remarked Rhody, retiring to the kitchen with a waiter full of dishes. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77504.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
