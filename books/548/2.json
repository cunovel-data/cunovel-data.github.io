{"id":23573,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER ONE Kettledrum and Fife","content":"The serene repose of Shady Dale no doubt stood for dulness and lack of progress in that day and time. In all ages of the world, and in all places, there are men of restless but superficial minds, who mistake repose and serenity for stagnation. No doubt then, as now, the most awful sentence to be passed on a community was to say that it was not progressive. But when you examine into the matter, what is called progress is nothing more nor less than the multiplication of the resources of those who, by means of dicker and barter, are trying all the time to overreach the public and their fellows, in one way and another. This sort of thing now has a double name; it is called civilisation, as well as progress, and those who take things as they find them in their morning newspaper, without going to the trouble to reflect for themselves, are no doubt duly impressed by terms that are large enough to fill both the ear and mouth at one and the same time. Well, whatever serene repose stands for, Shady Dale possessed it in an eminent degree, and the people there had their full share of the sorrows and troubles of this world, as Madame Awtry, or Miss Puella Gillum, or Neighbour Tomlin, or even that cheerful philosopher, Mr. Billy Sanders, could have told you; but of these Nan and Gabriel and Cephas knew nothing except in a vague, indefinite way. They heard hints of rumours, and sometimes they saw their elders shaking their heads as they gossiped together, but the youngsters lived in a world of their own, a world apart, and the vague rumours were no more interesting to them than the reports of canals on Mars are to the average person to-day. He reads in his newspaper that the markings in Mars are supposed to be canals; whereat he smiles and reflects that these canals can do him no harm. Nan and Gabriel and Cephas were as far from contemporary troubles as we are from Mars. The most serious trouble they had was not greater than that which they discovered one day on the Bermuda hill. As they were sitting on the warm grass, wondering how long before peaches would be ripe, they saw a field mouse cutting up some queer capers. Nan was not very friendly with mice, and she instinctively gathered up her skirts; but she did not run; her curiosity was ever greater than her fear. Presently we found that the troubles of Mother Mouse were very real. A tremendous black beetle had invaded her nest, and had seized one of her children, a little bit of a thing, naked and red and about the size of a half-ripe mulberry. We tried hard to rescue the mouse from the beetle, but soon found that it was quite dead. Cephas crushed the beetle, which was as venomous-looking a bug as they had ever seen. Was the beetle preparing to eat the mouse? Tasma Tid said yes, but Gabriel thought not. His idea was that the Mother Mouse had attacked the beetle, which was blindly crawling about, and had fallen in the nest accidentally. The beetle, striving to defend itself, had seized the mouse between its pinchers, and held it there until it was quite dead. But the Bermuda fields were not the only resource of the children. There were seasons when Uncle Plato, who was Meriwether Clopton\u0027s carriage-driver, came to town with the big waggon to haul home the supplies necessary for the plantation; loads of bagging and rope; cases of brogan shoes, and hats for the negroes; and bales on bales of osnaburgs and blankets. The appearance of the Clopton waggon on the public square was hailed by these youngsters with delight. They always made a rush for it, and, in riding back and forth with Uncle Plato, they spent some of the most delightful moments of their lives. And then in the fall season, there was the big gin running at the Clopton place, with old Beck, the blind mule, going round and round, turning the cogged and pivoted post that set the machinery in motion. But the youngsters rarely grew tired of riding back and forth with Uncle Plato. He was the one person in the world who catered most completely to their whims, who was most responsive to their budding and eager fancies, and who entered most enthusiastically into the regions created and peopled by Nan\u0027s skittish and fantastic imagination. These children had their critics, as may well be supposed, especially Nan, who did not always conform to the rules and theories which have been set up for the guidance of girls; but Uncle Plato, along with Gabriel and Cephas, accepted her as she was, with all her faults, and took as much delight in her tricksy and capricious behaviour, as if he were responsible for it all. She and her companions furnished Uncle Plato with what all story-tellers have most desired since hairy man began to shave himself with pumice-stone, and squat around a common hearth—a faithful and believing audience. Uncle ?sop, it may be, cared less for his audience than for the opportunity of lugging in a dismal and perfunctory moral. Uncle Plato, like Uncle Remus, concealed his behind text and adventure, conveying it none the less completely on that account. Not one of his vagaries was too wild for the acceptance of his small audience, and the elusiveness of his methods was a perpetual delight to Nan, as hers was to Uncle Plato, though he sometimes shook his head, and pretended to sigh over her innocent evasions. Once when we were all riding back and forth from the Clopton Place to Shady Dale, Nan asked Uncle Plato if he could spell. \"Tooby sho I kin, honey. What you reckon I been doin\u0027 all deze long-come-shorts ef I dunner how ter spell? How you speck I kin git \u0027long, haulin\u0027 an\u0027 maulin\u0027, ef I dunner how ter spell? Why, I could spell long \u0027fo\u0027 I know\u0027d my own name.\" \"Long-come-shorts, what are they?\" asked Nan. \"Rainy days an\u0027 windy nights,\" responded Uncle Plato, throwing his head back, and closing his eyes. \"Let\u0027s hear you spell, then,\" said Nan. \"Dee-o-egg, dog,\" was the prompt response. Nan looked at Uncle Plato to see if he was joking, but he was solemnity itself. \"E-double-egg, egg!\" he continued. \"Now spell John A. Murrell,\" said Nan. Murrell, the land pirate, was one of her favourite heroes at this time. Uncle Plato pretended to be very much shocked. \"Why, honey, dat man wuz rank pizen. En spozen he wa\u0027nt, how you speck me ter spell sump\u0027n er somebody which I ain\u0027t never laid eyes on? How I gwineter spell Johnny Murrell, an\u0027 him done dead dis many a long year ago?\" \"Well, spell goose, then,\" said Nan, seeing a flock of geese marching stiffly in single file across a field near the road. Uncle Plato looked at them carefully enough to take their measure, and then shook his head solemnly. \"Deyer so many un um, honey, dey\u0027d be monstus hard fer ter spell.\" \"Well, just spell one of them then,\" Nan suggested. \"Which un, honey?\" \"Any one you choose.\" Uncle Plato studied over the matter a moment, and again shook his head. \"Uh-uh, honey; dat ain\u0027t nigh gwine ter do. Ef you speck me fer ter spell goose, you got ter pick out de one you want me ter spell.\" \"Well, spell the one behind all the rest.\" Again Uncle Plato shook his head. \"Dat ar goose got half-grown goslin\u0027s, an\u0027 I ain\u0027t never larnt how ter spell goose wid half-grown goslin\u0027s. You ax too much, honey.\" \"Then spell the one next to head.\" Nan was inexorable. \"Dat ar ain\u0027t no goose,\" replied Uncle Plato, with an air of triumph; \"she\u0027s a gander.\" \"I don\u0027t believe you know how to spell goose,\" said Nan, with something like scorn. \"Don\u0027t you fool yo\u0027se\u0027f, honey,\" remarked Uncle Plato in a tone of confidence. \"You git me a great big fat un, not too ol\u0027, an\u0027 not too young, an\u0027 fill \u0027er full er stuffin\u0027, an\u0027 bake \u0027er brown in de big oven, an\u0027 save all de drippin\u0027s, an\u0027 put \u0027er on de table not fur fum whar I mought be settin\u0027 at, an\u0027 gi\u0027 me a pone er corn bread, an\u0027 don\u0027t have no talkin\u0027 an\u0027 laughin\u0027 in de game—an\u0027 ef I don\u0027t spell dat goose, I\u0027ll come mighty nigh it, I sholy will. Ef I don\u0027t spell \u0027er, dey won\u0027t be nuff lef\u0027 fer de nex\u0027 man ter spell. You kin \u0027pen\u0027 on dat, honey.\" Nan suddenly called Uncle Plato\u0027s attention to the carriage horses, which were hitched to the waggon. She said she knew their names well enough when they were pulling the carriage, but now— \"Haven\u0027t you changed the horses, Uncle Plato?\" she asked. \"How I gwine change um, honey?\" \"I mean, haven\u0027t you changed their places?\" \"No, ma\u0027am!\" he answered with considerable emphasis. \"No, ma\u0027am; ef I wuz ter put dat off hoss in de lead, you\u0027d see some mighty high kickin\u0027; you sho would.\" \"Oh, let\u0027s try it!\" cried Nan, with real eagerness. \"Dem may try it what choosen ter try it,\" responded Uncle Plato, dryly, \"but I\u0027ll ax um fer ter kindly le\u0027 me git win\u0027 er what deyer gwine ter do, an\u0027 den I\u0027ll make my \u0027rangerments fer ter be somers out\u0027n sight an\u0027 hearin\u0027.\" \"Well, if you haven\u0027t made the horses swap places,\" remarked Nan, \"I\u0027ll bet you a thrip that the right-hand horse is named Waffles, and the left-hand one Battercakes.\" At once Uncle Plato became very dignified. \"Well-\u0027um, I\u0027m mighty glad fer ter hear you sesso, kaze ef dey\u0027s any one thing what I want mo\u0027 dan anudder, it\u0027s a thrip\u0027s wuff er mannyfac terbacker. Ez fer de off hoss, dat\u0027s his name—Waffles—you sho called it right. But when it comes ter de lead hoss, anybody on de plantation, er off\u0027n it, I don\u0027t keer whar dey live at, ef dey yever so much ez hear er dat lead hoss, will be glad fer ter tell you dat he goes by de name er Muffins.\" He held out his hand for the thrip. \"Well, what is the difference?\" said Nan, drawing back as if to prevent him from taking the thrip. \"De diffunce er what?\" inquired Uncle Plato. \"And you expect me to give you money you haven\u0027t won,\" declared Nan. \"What\u0027s the difference between Battercakes and Muffins? A muffin is a battercake if you pour three big spoonfuls in a pan and spread it out, and a battercake is a muffin if you pen it up in a tin-thing like a napkin ring. Anybody can tell you that, Uncle Plato—yes, anybody.\" What reply the old negro would have made to this bit of home-made casuistry will never be known. That it would have been reasonable, if not entirely adequate, may well be supposed, but just as he had given his head a preliminary shake, the rattle of a kettle-drum was heard, and above the rattle a fife was shrilling. The shrilling fife, and the roll and rattle of the drums! These were sounds somewhat new to Shady Dale in 1860; but presently they were to be heard all over the land. \"I can see dem niggers right now!\" exclaimed Uncle Plato, as we hustled out of his waggon. \"Riley playin\u0027 de fife, Green beatin\u0027 on de kittledrum, an\u0027 Ike Varner bangin\u0027 on de big drum. Ef de white folks pay much \u0027tention ter dem niggers, dey won\u0027t be no livin\u0027 in de same county wid um. But dey better not come struttin\u0027 \u0027roun\u0027 me!\" The drums were beating the signal for calling together the men whose names had been signed to the roll of a company to be called the Shady Dale Scouts, and the meeting was for the purpose of organizing and electing officers. All this was accomplished in due time; but meanwhile Nan and Gabriel and Cephas, as well as Tasma Tid and all the rest of the children in the town, went tagging after the fife and drums listening to Riley play the beautiful marching tunes that set Nan\u0027s blood to tingling. Riley was a master hand with the fife, and we had never known it, had never even suspected it! Nan thought it was very mean in Riley not to tell somebody that he could play so beautifully. Well, in a very short time, the company was rigged out in the finest uniforms the children had even seen. All the men, even the privates, had plumes in their hats and epaulettes of gold on their shoulders; and on their coats they wore stripes of glowing red, and shiny brass buttons without number. And at least twice a week they marched through the streets and out into the Bermuda fields, where they had their drilling grounds. These were glorious days for the youngsters. Nan was so enthusiastic that she organised a company of little negroes, and insisted on being the captain. Gabriel was the first lieutenant, and Cephas was the second. When the company was ready to take the field, it was discovered that Nan would also have to be orderly sergeant and color-bearer. But she took on herself the duties and responsibilities of these positions without a murmur. She wore a paper hat of the true Napoleonic cut, and carried in one hand her famous sword-gun, and the colors in the other. The oldest private in Nan\u0027s company was nine; the youngest was four, and had as much as he could do to keep up with the rest. The uniforms of these sun-seasoned troops was the regulation plantation fatigue dress—a shirt coming to the knees. Two or three of the smaller privates had evidently fallen victims to the pot-liquor and buttermilk habits, for their bellies stuck out black and glistening from rents in their shirts. Their accoutrements prefigured in an absurd way the resources of the Confederacy at a later date. They were armed with broomsticks, and what-not. The file-leader had an old pair of tongs, which he snapped viciously when Nan gave the word to fire. The famous sword-gun, with which Nan did such execution, had once seen service as an umbrella handle. One afternoon, as Nan was drilling her troops, she chanced to glance down the road, and saw a waggon coming along. Deploying her company across the highway, she went forward in person to reconnoitre. She soon discovered that the waggon was driven by Uncle Plato. Running back to her veterans, she placed herself in front of them, and calmly awaited events. Slowly the fat horses dragged the waggon along, when suddenly Nan cried \"Halt!\" whereupon the drummer, obeying previous instructions, began to belabour his tin-pan, while Nan levelled her famous sword-gun at Uncle Plato. \"Bang!\" she exclaimed, and then, \"Why didn\u0027t you fall off the waggon?\" she cried, as Uncle Plato remained immovable. \"Why, you don\u0027t know any more about real war than a baby,\" she said scornfully. If the truth must be told, Uncle Plato had been dozing, and when he awoke he viewed the scene before him with astonishment. There was no need to cry \"Halt!\" or exclaim \"Bang!\" for as soon as the drummer began to beat his tin-pan, the horses stood still and craned their necks forward, with a warning snort, trying to see what this strange and unnatural proceeding meant. Uncle Plato had involuntarily tightened the reins when he was so rudely awakened, and the horses took this for a hint that they must avoid the danger, and, as the shortest way is the best way, they began to back, and had the waggon nearly turned around before Uncle Plato could tell them a different tale. \"Ef I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 fell out\u0027n de waggon, honey, who gwine ter pick me up?\" he asked, laughing. \"Why, no one is picked up in war!\" \"Is dis war, honey?\" \"Of course it is,\" Nan declared. \"Does bofe sides hafter take part in de rucus?\" asked Uncle Plato, making a terrible face at the little negroes. \"Why, of course,\" said Nan. Seeing the scowl, Nan\u0027s veteran troops began to edge slowly toward the nearest breach in the fence. Uncle Plato seized his whip and pretended to be clambering from the waggon. At this a panic ensued, and Nan\u0027s army dispersed in a jiffy. The seasoned troops dropped their arms and fled. The four-year-old became lost or entangled in a thick growth of jimson weed, seeing which, Uncle Plato cried out in terrible voice, \"Ketch um dar! Fetch um here!\" Then and there ensued a wild scene of demoralisation and anarchy; loud shrieks and screams filled the air; the dogs barked, the hens cackled, and the neighbours began to put their heads out of the windows. Mrs. Absalom, who had charge of the Dorrington household, and who had raised Nan from a baby, came to the door—the defeat of the troops occurred right at Nan\u0027s own home—crying, \"My goodness gracious! has the yeth caved in?\" Then, seeing the waggon crosswise the road, and mistaking Nan\u0027s shrieks of laughter for cries of pain, she bolted from the house with a white face. Mrs. Absalom\u0027s reactions from her daily alarms about Nan usually resulted in bringing her into open and direct war with everybody in sight or hearing, except the child; but on this occasion, her fright had been so serious that when Nan, somewhat sobered, ran to her the good woman was shaking. \"Why, Nonny!\" cried Nan, hugging her, \"you are all trembling.\" \"No wonder,\" said Mrs. Absalom in a subdued voice; \"I saw you under them waggon wheels as plain as I ever saw anything in my life. I\u0027m gittin\u0027 old, I reckon.\" And yet there were some people who wondered how Nan could endure such a foster-mother as Mrs. Absalom. But the complete rout of Nan\u0027s army made no change in the general complexion of affairs. The Shady Dale Scouts continued to perfect themselves in the tactics of war, and after awhile, when the great controversy began to warm up—the children paid no attention to the passage of time—the company went into camp. This was a great hour for the youngsters. Here at last was something real and tangible. The marching and the countermarching through the streets and in the old field were very well in their way, but Nan and Gabriel and the rest had grown used to these man[oe]uvres, and they longed for something new. This was furnished by the camp, with its white tents, and the grim sentinels pacing up and down with fixed bayonets. No one, not even an officer, could pass the sentinels without giving the password, or calling for the officer of the guard. All this, from the children\u0027s point of view, was genuine war; but to the members of the company it was a veritable picnic. The citizens of the town, especially the ladies, sent out waggon loads of food every day—boiled ham, barbecued shote, chicken pies, and cake; yes, and pickles. Nan declared she didn\u0027t know there were as many pickles in the world, as she saw unloaded at the camp. Mr. Goodlett, who was Mrs. Absalom\u0027s husband, went out to the camp, looked it over with the eye of an expert, and turned away with a groan. This citizen had served both in the Mexican and the Florida wars, and he knew that these gallant young men would have a rude awakening, when it came to the real tug of war. \"Doesn\u0027t it look like war, Mr. Ab?\" Nan asked, running after the veteran. Mr. Goodlett looked at the bright face lifted up to his, and frowned, though a smile of pity showed itself around his grizzled mouth. He was a very deliberate man, and he hesitated before he spoke. \"You think that looks like war?\" he asked. \"Why, of course. Isn\u0027t that the way they do when there\u0027s a war?\" \"What! gormandise, an\u0027 set in the shade? Why, it ain\u0027t no more like war than sparrergrass is like jimson weed—not one ioter.\" With that, he sighed and went on his way. But when did the precepts of age and experience ever succeed in chilling the enthusiasm of youth? With the children, it was \"O to be a soldier boy!\" and Nan and her companions continued to linger around the edges of the spectacle, taking it all in, and enjoying every moment. And the Scouts themselves continued to live like lords, eating and drilling, and dozing during the day, and at night dancing to the sweet music of Flavian Dion\u0027s violin. Nan and Gabriel thought it was fine, and, as well as can be remembered, Cephas was of the same opinion. As for Tasma Tid, she thought that the fife and drums, and the general glare and glitter of the affair were simply grand, very much nicer than war in her country, where the Arab slave-traders crept up in the night and seized all who failed to escape in the forest, killing right and left for the mere love of killing. Compared with the jungle war, this pageant was something to be admired. And many of the older citizens held views not very different from those of the children, for enthusiasm ran high. The Shady Dale Scouts went away arrayed in their holiday uniforms. Many of them never returned to their homes again, but those that did were arrayed in rags and tatters. Their gallantry was such that the Shady Dale Scouts, disguised as Company B, were always at the head of their regiment when trouble was on hand. But all this is to anticipate. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77488.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
