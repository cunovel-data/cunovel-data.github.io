{"id":23585,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER THIRTEEN The union League Organises","content":"The silence was presently broken by a very clear and distinct voice, which both Nan and Gabriel recognised as that of the stranger whom they had overheard talking to the Rev. Jeremiah. \"Before we proceed to the business that has called us together,\" said the voice, \"it is best that we should come to some clear understanding. I am not here in my own behalf. I have nothing to lose except my life, and nothing to gain but the betterment of those who have been released from the horrors of slavery. Very few of you know even my name, but the very fact that I am here with you to-night should go far to reassure you. It is sufficient to say that I represent the great party that has given you your freedom. That fact constitutes my credentials.\" \"Bless God!\" exclaimed the Rev. Jeremiah, piously. He rolled the word \"credentials\" under his tongue, and resolved to remember it and bring it out in one of his sermons. The stranger had a very smooth and pleasing delivery. There was a sort of Sunday-school cadence to his voice well calculated to impress his audience. The language he employed was far above the heads of those to whom he spoke, but his persuasive tone, and his engaging manner carried conviction. The great majority of the negroes present were ready to believe what he said whether they understood it or not. \"My name,\" he went on, \"is Gilbert Hotchkiss, and I belong to a family that has been striving for more than a generation to bring about the emancipation of the negroes. My father worked until the day of his death for the abolition of slavery; and now that slavery has been abolished, I, with thousands of devoted women and men whom you have never seen and doubtless never will see, have begun the work of uplifting the coloured people in order that they may be placed in a position to appreciate the benefits that have been conferred on them, and enable them to enjoy the fruits of freedom. It is a great work, a grand work, and all we ask is the active co-operation and assistance of the coloured people themselves.\" These were the words of Mr. Hotchkiss, the philanthropist; but now Mr. Hotchkiss, the politician, took his place, and there was an indefinable change in the tone of his voice. \"There is no need to ask,\" he said, \"why we do not, in this great work of uplifting the coloured race, ask the assistance of those who were lately in rebellion against the best and the greatest Government on which the sun ever shone. It would be foolish and unreasonable to expect their assistance. They fought to destroy the union, and they were defeated; they fought to perpetuate slavery, and they failed. More than that, there is every reason to believe that they will refuse to abide by the results of the war. They are very quiet now, but they are merely waiting their opportunity. With our troops withdrawn, and with the Republican Party weakened by opposition, what is to prevent your late masters from placing you back in slavery? Could we expect anything less from those who have been brought up to believe that slavery is a divine institution?\" \"You hear dat, people?\" cried the Rev. Jeremiah. \"You cannot help believing,\" continued Mr. Hotchkiss, \"that your former masters would force the chains of slavery on you if they could; all they lack is the opportunity; and if you are not careful, they will find an opportunity, or make one. Slavery was profitable to them once, and it would be profitable again. There is one fact you should never forget,\" said the speaker, warming up a little. \"It is a most stupendous fact, namely: that every dollar\u0027s worth of property in all this Southern land has been earned by the labour of your hands and by the sweat of your brows. It has been earned by you, not once, but many times over. You have earned every dollar that has ever circulated here. The lands, the houses, the stock, and all the farm improvements are a part of the fruits of negro labour; and when right and justice prevail, this property, or a very large part of it, will be yours.\" This statement was received with demonstrations of approval, one of the audience exclaiming: \"You sho\u0027 is talkin\u0027 now, boss!\" \"But how are right and justice to prevail? Only by the constant and continued success of the party of which the martyred Lincoln was the leader. The mission of that party has not yet been fulfilled. First, it made you freemen. Then it went a step further, and made you citizens and voters. Should you sustain it by your votes, it will take still another step, and give you an opportunity to reap some of the fruits of your toil, as well as the toil of the unfortunates who pined away and died or who were starved under the infamous system of slavery.\" \"Ain\u0027t it de trufe!\" exclaimed the Rev. Jeremiah fervently. \"We have met here to-night to organise a union League,\" continued Mr. Hotchkiss. \"The object of this league is to bring about a unity of purpose and action among its members, to give them opportunities to confer together, and to secure a clear understanding. No one knows what will happen. Your former masters are jealous of your rights; they will try by every means in their power to take these rights away from you. They will employ both force and fraud, and the only way for you to meet and overcome this danger is to organise. Ten men who understand one another and act together are more powerful than a hundred who act as individuals. You must be as wise as serpents, but not as harmless as doves. Your rights have been bought for you by the blood of thousands of martyrs, and you must defend them. If necessary arm yourselves. Yea! if necessary apply the torch.\" There was a certain air of plausibility about this harangue, a degree of earnestness, that impressed Gabriel, and he does not know to this day whether this ill-informed emissary of race hatred and sectional prejudice really believed all that he said. Who shall judge? Certainly not those who remember the temper of those times, the revengeful attitude of the radical leaders at the North, and the distorted fears of those who suddenly found themselves surrounded by a horde of ignorant voters, pliant tools in the hands of unscrupulous carpet-baggers. Hotchkiss brought his remarks to a close, and then proceeded to read the constitution and by-laws of the proposed union League, under which, he explained, hundreds of leagues had been organised. Each one who desired to become a member was to make oath separately and individually that he would not betray the secrets of the league, nor disclose the signs and passwords, nor tolerate any opposition to the Republican Party, nor have any unnecessary dealings with rebels and former slave-holders. He was to keep eyes and ears open, and report all important developments to the league. \"We are now ready, I presume, for the ceremonies to begin,\" remarked Mr. Hotchkiss. \"First we will elect officers of the league, and I suggest that the Honourable Jeremiah Tomlin be made President.\" \"Dat\u0027s right!\" \"He sho is de man!\" \"No needs fer ter put dat ter de question!\" were some of the indorsements that came from various parts of the room. The Rev. Jeremiah was immensely tickled by the title of Honourable that had been so unexpectedly bestowed on him. He hung his head with as much modesty as he could summon, and, bearing in mind his calling, one might have been pardoned for suspecting that he was offering up a brief prayer of thanksgiving. He rose in his place, however, passed the back of his hand across his mouth, paused a moment, and then began: \"Mr. Cheer, I thank you an\u0027 deze friends might\u0027ly fer de renomination er my name, an\u0027 de gener\u0027l endossments er de balance er deze gentermen. So fur, so good. But, Mr. Cheer, \u0027fo\u0027 we gits right spang down ter business, I moves dat some er de br\u0027ers be ax\u0027d fer ter give der idee er dis plan which have been laid befo\u0027 us by our hon\u0027bul frien\u0027. I moves dot we hear fum Br\u0027er Plato Clopton, ef so be de sperret is on him fer ter gi\u0027 us his sesso.\" Uncle Plato, taken somewhat by surprise, was slow in responding, but when he rose, he presented a striking figure. He was taller than the average negro, and there was a simple dignity—an air of gentility and serene affability—in his attitude and bearing that attracted the attention of Mr. Hotchkiss. The Rev. Jeremiah was still standing, and Uncle Plato, after bowing gracefully to Mr. Hotchkiss, turned with a smile to the negro who had called on him. \"You know mighty well, Br\u0027er Jerry, dat I ain\u0027t sech a talker ez ter git up an\u0027 say my say des dry so, an\u0027 let it go at dat. Howsomever, I laid off ter say sump\u0027n, an\u0027 I ain\u0027t sorry you called my name. In what\u0027s been said dey\u0027s a heap dat I \u0027gree wid. I b\u0027lieve dat de cullud folks oughter work tergedder, an\u0027 stan tergedder fer ter he\u0027p an\u0027 be holped. But when you call on me fer ter turn my back on my marster, an\u0027 go to hatin\u0027 \u0027im, you\u0027ll hatter skuzen me. You sho will.\" \"He ain\u0027t yo\u0027 marster now, Br\u0027er Plato, an\u0027 you know it,\" said the Rev. Jeremiah. \"I know dat mighty well,\" replied Uncle Plato, \"but ef it don\u0027t hurt my feelin\u0027s fer ter call him dat it oughtn\u0027t ter pester yuther people. How it may be wid you all, I dunno; but me an\u0027 my marster wus boys tergedder. We useter play wid one an\u0027er, an\u0027 fall out an\u0027 fight, an\u0027 I\u0027ve whipped him des ez many times ez he ever whipped me—an\u0027 he\u0027ll tell you de same.\" \"But all this,\" suggested Mr. Hotchkiss coldly, \"has nothing to do with the matter in hand. The coloured race is facing conditions that amount to a crisis—a crisis that has no parallel in the world\u0027s history.\" \"Dat is suttinly so!\" the Rev. Jeremiah ejaculated, though he had but a dim notion of what Hotchkiss was talking about. \"They have been made citizens,\" pursued the organiser, \"and it is their duty to demand all their rights and to be satisfied with nothing less. The best men of our party believe that the rebels are still rebellious, and that they will seize the first opportunity to re-enslave the coloured people.\" \"Ah-yi!\" exclaimed the Rev. Jeremiah triumphantly. \"Does you reely b\u0027lieve, Br\u0027er Jerry, dat Pulaski Tomlin will ever try ter put you back in slav\u0027ry?\" asked Uncle Plato. The inquiry was a poser, and the Rev. Jeremiah was unable to make any satisfactory reply. Perceiving this, Mr. Hotchkiss came to the rescue. \"You must bear in mind,\" he blandly remarked, \"that this is not a question of one person here and another person there. It concerns a whole race. Should all the former slave-owners of the South succeed in reclaiming their slaves, Mr. Tomlin and Mr. Clopton would be compelled by public sentiment to reclaim theirs. If they refused to do so, their former slaves would fall into the hands of new masters. It is not a question of individuals at all.\" \"Well, suh, we\u0027ll fin\u0027 out atter awhile dat we\u0027ll hatter do like de white folks. Eve\u0027y tub\u0027ll hatter stan\u0027 on its own bottom. I\u0027m des ez free now ez I wuz twenty year ago——\" \"I can well believe that, after what you have said,\" Mr. Hotchkiss interrupted. The tone of his voice was as smooth as velvet, but his words carried the sting of an imputation, and Uncle Plato felt it and resented it. \"Yes, suh,—an\u0027 I wuz des ez free twenty year ago ez you all will ever be. My marster has been good ter me fum de work go. I ain\u0027t stayin\u0027 wid \u0027im bekaze he got money. Ef him an\u0027 Miss Sa\u0027ah di\u0027n\u0027a have a dollar in de worl\u0027, an no way ter git it, I\u0027d work my arms off fer \u0027m. An\u0027 ef I \u0027fused ter do it, my wife\u0027d quit me, an\u0027 my chillun wouldn\u0027t look at me. But I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do: when my marster tu\u0027ns his back on me I\u0027ll tu\u0027n my back on him.\" \"I\u0027m really sorry that you persist in making this question a personal one when it affects all the negroes now living and millions yet to be born,\" said Mr. Hotchkiss. \"Well, suh, le\u0027s look at it dat away,\" Uncle Plato insisted. \"Spoz\u0027n you ban\u0027 tergedder like dis, an\u0027 try ter tu\u0027n de white folks ag\u0027in you, an\u0027 dey see what you up ter, an\u0027 tu\u0027n der backs, den what you gwine ter do? You got ter live here an\u0027 you got ter make yo\u0027 livin\u0027 here. Is you gwine ter cripple de cow dat gives de cream?\" Uncle Plato paused and looked around. He saw at once that he was in a hopeless minority, and so he reached for his hat. \"I\u0027m mighty glad ter know you, suh,\" he said to Mr. Hotchkiss, with a bow that Chesterfield might have envied, \"but I\u0027ll hatter bid you good-night.\" With that, he went out, followed by Wiley Millirons and Walthall\u0027s Jake, much to the relief of the Rev. Jeremiah, who proceeded to denounce \"white folks\u0027 niggers,\" and to utter some very violent threats. Then, in no long time, the union League was organised. Those in the closet failed to hear the words that constituted the ceremony of initiation. Only low mutterings came to their ears. But the ceremony consisted of a lot of mummery well calculated to impress the simple-minded negroes. After a time the meeting adjourned, the solitary candle was blown out, and the last negro departed. Gabriel waited until all sounds had died away, and then, with a brief good-night to Tasma Tid, he opened the closet door, slipped out, and was soon on his way home. But before he was out of the dark grove, some one went flitting by him—in fact, he thought he saw two figures dimly outlined in the darkness; yet he was not sure—and presently he thought he heard a mocking laugh, which sounded very much as if it had issued from the lips of Nan Dorrington. But he was not sure that he heard the laugh, and how, he asked himself, could he imagine that it was Nan Dorrington\u0027s even if he had heard it? He told himself confidentially, the news to go no further, that he was a drivelling idiot. As Gabriel went along he soon forgot his momentary impressions as to the two figures in the dark and the laugh that had seemed to come floating back to him. The suave and well-modulated voice of Mr. Hotchkiss rang in his ears. He had but one fault to find with the delivery: Mr. Hotchkiss dwelt on his r\u0027s until they were as long as a fishing-pole, and as sharp as a shoemaker\u0027s awl. Though these magnified r\u0027s made Gabriel\u0027s flesh crawl, he had been very much impressed by the address, only part of which has been reported here. Boylike, he never paused to consider the motives or the ulterior purpose of the speaker. Gabriel knew of course that there was no intention on the part of the whites to re-enslave the negroes; he knew that there was not even a desire to do so. He knew, too, that there were many incendiary hints in the address—hints that were illuminated and emphasised more by the inflections of the speaker\u0027s voice than by the words in which they were conveyed. In spite of the fact that he resented these hints as keenly as possible, he could see the plausibility of the speaker\u0027s argument in so far as it appealed to the childish fears and doubts and uneasiness of the negroes. If anything could be depended on, he thought, to promote a spirit of incendiarism among the negroes such an address would be that thing. If Gabriel had attended some of the later meetings of the league, he would have discovered that the address he had heard was a milk-and-water affair, compared with some of the harangues that were made to the negroes in the old school-house. All that Gabriel had heard was duly reported to Meriwether Clopton, and to Mr. Sanders, and in a very short time all the whites in the community became aware of the fact that the negroes were taking lessons in race-hatred and incendiarism, and as a natural result, Hotchkiss became a marked man. His comings and goings were all noted, so much so that he soon found it convenient as well as comfortable to make his head-quarters in the country, at the home of Judge Mahlon Butts, whose union principles had carried him into the Republican Party. The Judge lived a mile and a half from the corporation line, and Mr. Hotchkiss\u0027s explanation for moving there was that the exercise to be found in walking back and forth was necessary to his health. Uncle Plato was very much surprised the next day to be called into the house where Mr. Sanders was sitting with Meriwether Clopton and Miss Sarah in order that they might shake hands with him. \"I want to shake your hand, Plato,\" said his old master. \"I\u0027ve always thought a great deal of you, but I think more of you to-day than ever before.\" \"And you must shake hands with me, Plato,\" remarked Sarah Clopton. \"Well, sence shakin\u0027 han\u0027s is comin\u0027 more into fashion these days, I reckon you\u0027ll have to shake wi\u0027 me,\" declared Mr. Sanders. \"I declar\u0027 ter gracious I dunner whedder you all is makin\u0027 fun er me or not!\" exclaimed Uncle Plato. \"But sump\u0027n sholy must \u0027a\u0027 happened, kaze des now when I wuz downtown Mr. Alford call me in his sto\u0027 an\u0027 \u0027low, \u0027Plato, when you wanter buy anything, des come right in, money er no money, kaze yo\u0027 credit des ez good in here ez de best man in town.\u0027 I dunner what done come over eve\u0027ybody.\" He went away laughing. Nevertheless, Uncle Plato was more seriously affected by the schemes of Mr. Hotchkiss than any other inhabitant of Shady Dale. He had been a leader in the Rev. Jeremiah\u0027s church, and up to the day of the organisation of the union League, had wielded an influence among the negroes second only to that of the Rev. Jeremiah himself. But now all was changed. He soon found that he would have to resign his deaconship, for those whom he had regarded as his spiritual brethren were now his enemies—at any rate they were no longer his friends. But Uncle Plato had one consolation in his troubles, and that was the strong indorsement and support of Aunt Charity, his wife, who was the cook at Clopton\u0027s, famous from one end of the State to the other for her biscuits and waffles. Uncle Plato had been somewhat dubious about her attitude, for the negro women had developed the most intense partisanship, and some of them were loud in their threats, going much further than the men. No doubt Aunt Charity would have taken a different course had she been in her husband\u0027s place, if only for the sake of her colour, as she called her race. She was very fond of her own white folks, but she had her prejudices against the rest. When Uncle Plato reached home and told his wife what he had said and done, she drew a long breath and looked at him hard for some time. Then she took up her pipe from the chimney-corner, remarking, \"Well, what you done, you done; dar\u0027s yo\u0027 supper.\" Uncle Plato had a remarkably good appetite, and while he ate, Aunt Charity sat near a window and looked out at the stars. She was getting together in her mind a supply of personal reminiscences, of which she had a goodly store. Presently, she began to shake with laughter, which she tried to suppress. Uncle Plato mistook the sound he heard for an evidence of grief, and he spoke up promptly: \"I declar\u0027 ef I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 know\u0027d I wuz gwine ter hurt yo\u0027 feelings, I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 j\u0027ined in wid um den an\u0027 dar. An\u0027 \u0027taint too late yit. I kin go ter Br\u0027er Jerry an\u0027 tell him whilst I ain\u0027t change my own min\u0027 I\u0027ll j\u0027ine in wid um druther dan be offish an\u0027 mule-headed.\" \"No you won\u0027t! no you won\u0027t! no you won\u0027t!\" exclaimed Aunt Charity. \"I mought \u0027a\u0027 done diffunt, an\u0027 I mought \u0027a\u0027 done wrong. We\u0027ll hatter git out\u0027n de church, ef you kin call it a church, but dat ain\u0027t so mighty hard ter do. Yit, \u0027fo\u0027 we does git out I\u0027m gwine ter preach ol\u0027 Jerry\u0027s funer\u0027l one time—des one time. Dat what make me laugh des now; I was runnin\u0027 over in my min\u0027 how I kin raise his hide. Some folks got de idee dat kaze I\u0027m fat I\u0027m bleeze ter be long-sufferin\u0027; but you know better\u0027n dat, don\u0027t you?\" \"Well, I know dis,\" said Uncle Plato, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, \"when you git yo\u0027 dander up you kin talk loud an\u0027 long.\" \"Miss Sa\u0027ah done tol\u0027 me dat when I git mad, I kin keep up a conversation ez long ez de nex\u0027 one,\" remarked Aunt Charity, with real pride. \"An\u0027 den dar\u0027s dat hat Miss Sa\u0027ah gi\u0027 me; I laid off ter w\u0027ar it ter church nex\u0027 Sunday, but now—well, I speck I better des w\u0027ar my head-hankcher, kaze dey\u0027s sho gwine ter be trouble ef any un um look at me cross-eyed.\" \"You gwine, is you?\" Uncle Plato asked. \"Ef I live,\" replied Aunt Charity, \"I\u0027m des ez good ez dar right now. An\u0027 mo\u0027 dan dat, you\u0027ll go too. \u0027Tain\u0027t gwineter be said dat de Clopton niggers hung der heads bekaze dey stood by der own white folks. Ef it\u0027s said, it\u0027ll hatter be said \u0027bout some er de yuthers.\" \"I\u0027ll go,\" said Uncle Plato, \"but I hope I won\u0027t hatter frail Br\u0027er Jerry out.\" \"Now, dat\u0027s right whar we gits crossways,\" Aunt Charity declared. \"I hope you\u0027ll hatter frail \u0027im out.\" Fortunately, Uncle Plato had no excuse for using his walking-cane on the Rev. Jeremiah, when Sunday came. None of the church-members made any active show of animosity. They simply held themselves aloof. Aunt Charity had her innings, however. When services were over, and the congregation was slowly filing out of the building, followed by the Rev. Jeremiah, she remarked loud enough for all to hear her: \"Br\u0027er Jerry, de nex\u0027 time you want me ter cook pullets fer dat ar Lizzie Gaither, des fetch um \u0027long. I\u0027ll be glad ter \u0027blige you.\" As the Rev. Jeremiah\u0027s wife was close at hand, the closing scenes can be better imagined than described. In this chronicle the veil of silence must be thrown over them. It may be said, nevertheless, that Uncle Plato and his wife felt very keenly the awkward position in which they were placed by the increasing prejudice of the rest of the negroes. They were both sociable in their natures, but now they were practically cut off from all association with those who had been their very good friends. It was a real sacrifice they had to make. On the other hand, who shall say that their firmness in this matter was not the means of preventing, at least in Shady Dale, many of the misfortunes that fell to the lot of the negroes elsewhere? There can hardly be a doubt that their attitude, firm and yet modest, had a restraining influence on some of the more reckless negroes, who, under the earnest but dangerous teachings of Hotchkiss and his fellow-workers, would otherwise have been led into excesses which would have called for bloody reprisals.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77500.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
