{"id":23579,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER SEVEN Silas Tomlin Goes A-Calling","content":"When the solemn funeral ceremonies were over, it was arranged that Nan should spend a few days with her new friend, Margaret Gaither—she was never called by the name of her father after her mother died—and Gabriel took advantage of Nan\u0027s temporary absence to pay a visit to Mrs. Absalom. He was very fond of that strong-minded woman; but since Nan had grown to be such a young lady, he had not called as often as he had been in the habit of doing. He was afraid, indeed, that some one would accuse him of a sneaking desire to see Nan, and he was also afraid of the quizzing which Nan\u0027s father was always eager to apply. But with Nan away—her absence being notorious, as you may say—Gabriel felt that he could afford to call on the genial housekeeper. Mrs. Absalom had for years been the manager of the Dorrington household, and she retained her place even after Randolph Dorrington had taken for his second wife Zepherine Dion, who had been known as Miss Johns, and who was now called Mrs. Johnny Dorrington. In that household, indeed, Mrs. Absalom was indispensable, and it was very fortunate that she and Mrs. Johnny were very fond of each other. Her maiden name was Margaret Rorick, and she came of a family that had long been attached to the Dorringtons. In another clime, and under a different system, the Roricks would have been described as retainers. They were that and much more. They served without fee or reward. They were retainers in the highest and best sense; for, in following the bent of their affections, they retained their independence, their simple dignity and their self-respect; and in that region, which was then, and is now, the most democratic in the world, they were as well thought of as the Cloptons or the Dorringtons. It came to pass, in the order of events, that Margaret Rorick married Mr. Absalom Goodlett, who was the manager of the Dorrington plantation. Though she was no chicken, as she said herself, Mr. Goodlett was her senior by several years. She was also, in a sense, the victim of the humour that used to run riot in Middle Georgia; for, in spite of her individuality, which was vigorous and aggressive, she lost her own name and her husband\u0027s too. At Margaret Rorick\u0027s wedding, or, rather, at the infair, which was the feast after the wedding, Mr. Uriah Lazenby, whose memory is kept green by his feats at tippling, and who combined fiddling with farming, furnished the music for the occasion. Being something of a privileged character, and having taken a thimbleful too much dram, as fiddlers will do, the world over, Mr. Lazenby rose in his place, when the company had been summoned to the feast, and remarked: \"Margaret Rorick, now that the thing\u0027s been gone and done, and can\u0027t be holp, I nominate you Mrs. Absalom, an\u0027 Mrs. Absalom it shall be herearter. Ab Goodlett, you ought to be mighty proud when you can fling your bridle on a filly like that, an\u0027 lead her home jest for the bar\u0027 sesso.\" The loud laughter that followed placed the bride at a temporary disadvantage. She joined in, however, and then exclaimed: \"My goodness! Old Uriah\u0027s drunk ag\u0027in; you can\u0027t pull a stopper out\u0027n a jug in the same house wi\u0027 him but what he\u0027ll dribble at the mouth an\u0027 git shaky in the legs.\" But drunk or sober, Uriah had \"nominated\" Mrs. Absalom for good and all. One reason why this \"nomination\" was seized on so eagerly was the sudden change that had taken place in Miss Rorick\u0027s views in regard to matrimony. She was more than thirty years old when she consented to become Mrs. Absalom. Up to that time she had declared over and over again that there wasn\u0027t a man in the world she\u0027d look at, much less marry. Now, many a woman has said the same thing and changed her mind without attracting attention; but Mrs. Absalom\u0027s views on matrimony, and her pithy criticisms of the male sex in general, had flown about on the wings of her humour, and, in that way, had come to have wide advertisement. But her \"nomination\" interfered neither with her individuality, nor with her ability to indulge in pithy comments on matters and things in general. Of Mr. Lazenby, she said later: \"What\u0027s the use of choosin\u0027 betwixt a fool an\u0027 a fiddler, when you can git both in the same package?\" She made no bad bargain when she married Mr. Goodlett. His irritability was all on the surface. At bottom, he was the best-natured and most patient of men—a philosopher who was so thoroughly contented with the ways of the world and the order of Providence, that he had no desire to change either—and so comfortable in his own views and opinions that he was not anxious to convert others to his way of thinking. If anything went wrong, it was like a garment turned inside out; it would \"come out all right in the washin\u0027.\" Mrs. Absalom\u0027s explanation of her change of views in the subject of matrimony was very simple and reasonable. \"Why, a single \u0027oman,\" she said, \"can\u0027t cut no caper at all; she can\u0027t hardly turn around wi\u0027out bein\u0027 plumb tore to pieces by folks\u0027s tongues. But now—you see Ab over there? Well, he ain\u0027t purty enough for a centre-piece, nor light enough for to be set on the mantel-shelf, but it\u0027s a comfort to see him in that cheer there, knowin\u0027 all the time that you can do as you please, and nobody dastin to say anything out of the way. Why, I could put on Ab\u0027s old boots an\u0027 take his old buggy umbrell, an\u0027 go an\u0027 jine the muster. The men might snicker behind the\u0027r han\u0027s, but all they could say would be, \u0027Well, ef that kind of a dido suits Ab Goodlett, it ain\u0027t nobody else\u0027s business.\u0027\" It happened that Mr. Sanders was the person to whom Mrs. Absalom was addressing her remarks, and he inquired if such an unheard of proceeding would be likely to suit Mr. Goodlett. \"To a t!\" she exclaimed. \"Why, he wouldn\u0027t bat his eye. He mought grunt an\u0027 groan a little jest to let you know that he\u0027s alive, but that\u0027d be all. An\u0027 that\u0027s the trouble: ef Ab has any fault in the world that you can put your finger on, it\u0027s in bein\u0027 too good. You know, William—anyhow, you\u0027d know it ef you belonged to my seck—that there\u0027s lots of times and occasions when it\u0027d make the wimmen folks feel lots better ef they had somethin\u0027 or other to rip and rare about. My old cat goes about purrin\u0027, the very spit and image of innocence; but she\u0027d die ef she didn\u0027t show her claws sometimes. Once in awhile I try my level best for to pick a quarrel wi\u0027 Ab, but before I say a dozen words, I look at him an\u0027 have to laugh. Why the way that man sets there an\u0027 says nothin\u0027 is enough to make a saint ashamed of hisself.\" It was the general opinion that Mr. Goodlett, who was shrewd and far-seeing beyond the average, had an eye to strengthening his relations with Dr. Dorrington, when he \"popped the question\" to Margaret Rorick. But such was not the case. His relations needed no strengthening. He managed Dorrington\u0027s agricultural interests with uncommon ability, and brought rare prosperity to the plantation. Unlettered, and, to all appearances, taking no interest in public affairs, he not only foresaw the end of the Civil War, but looked forward to the time when the Confederate Government, pressed for supplies, would urge upon the States the necessity of limiting the raising of cotton. He gave both Meriwether Clopton and Neighbour Tomlin the benefit of these views; and then, when the rumours of Sherman\u0027s march through Georgia grew rifer he made a shrewd guess as to the route, and succeeded in hiding out and saving, not only all the cotton the three plantations had grown, but also all the livestock. Having an ingrained suspicion of the negroes, and entertaining against them the prejudices of his class, Mr. Goodlett employed a number of white boys from the country districts to aid him with his refugee train. And he left them in charge of the camp he had selected, knowing full well that they would be glad to remain in hiding as long as the Federal soldiers were about. The window of the dining-room at Dorringtons\u0027 commanded a view of the street for a considerable distance toward town, and it was at this window that Mrs. Absalom had her favourite seat. She explained her preference for it by saying that she wanted to know what was going on in the world. She looked out from this window one day while she was talking to Gabriel Tolliver, whose visits to Dorringtons\u0027 had come to be coincident with Nan\u0027s absence, and suddenly exclaimed: \"Well, my gracious! Ef yonder ain\u0027t old Picayune Pauper! I wonder what we have done out this way that old Picayune should be sneakin\u0027 around here? I\u0027ll tell you what—ef Ab has borried arry thrip from old Silas Tomlin, I\u0027ll quit him; I won\u0027t live wi\u0027 a man that\u0027ll have anything to do wi\u0027 that old scamp. As I\u0027m a livin\u0027 human, he\u0027s comin\u0027 here!\" Now, Silas Tomlin was Neighbour Tomlin\u0027s elder brother, but the two men were as different in character and disposition as a warm bright day is different from a bitter black night. Pulaski Tomlin gave his services freely to all who needed them, and he was happy and prosperous; whereas Silas was a miserly money-lender and note-shaver, and always appeared to be in the clutches of adversity. To parsimony he added the sting—yes, and the stain—of a peevish and an irritable temper. It was as Mrs. Absalom had said—\"a picayunish man is a pauper, I don\u0027t care how much money he\u0027s got.\" \"I\u0027ll go see ef Johnny is in the house,\" said Mrs. Absalom. \"Johnny\" was Mrs. Dorrington, who, in turn, called Mrs. Absalom \"Nonny,\" which was Nan\u0027s pet name for the woman who had raised her—\"I\u0027ll go see, but I lay she\u0027s gone to see Nan; I never before seed a step-mammy so wropped up in her husband\u0027s daughter.\" Nan, as has been said, was spending a few days with poor Margaret Bridalbin, whose mother had just been buried. Mrs. Absalom called Mrs. Dorrington, and then looked for her, but she was not to be found at the moment. \"I reckon you\u0027ll have to go to the door, Gabe,\" said Mrs. Absalom, as the knocker sounded. \"Sence freedom, we ain\u0027t got as many niggers lazyin\u0027 around an\u0027 doin\u0027 nothin\u0027 as we use to have.\" \"Is Mr. Goodlett in?\" asked Silas Tomlin, when Gabriel opened the door. \"I think he\u0027s in Malvern,\" Gabriel answered, as politely as he could. \"No, no, no!\" exclaimed Silas Tomlin, with a terrible frown; \"you don\u0027t know a thing about it, not a thing in the world. He got back right after dinner.\" \"Well, ef he did,\" said Mrs. Absalom, coming forward, \"he didn\u0027t come here. He ain\u0027t cast a shadow in this house sence day before yistiddy, when he went to Malvern.\" \"How are you, Mrs. Absalom?—how are you?\" said Silas, with a tremendous effort at politeness. \"I hope you are well; you are certainly looking well. You say your husband is not in? Well, I\u0027m sorry; I wanted to see him on business; I wanted to get some information.\" \"Ab don\u0027t owe you anything, I hope,\" remarked Mrs. Absalom, ignoring the salutation. \"Not a thing—not a thing in the world. But why do you ask? Many people have the idea that I\u0027m rolling in money—that\u0027s what I hear—and they think that I go about loaning it to Tom, Dick and Harry. But it is not so—it is not so; I have no money.\" Mrs. Absalom laughed ironically, saying, \"I reckon if your son Paul was to scratch about under the house, he\u0027d find small change about in places.\" Silas Tomlin looked hard at Mrs. Absalom, his little black eyes glistening under his coarse, heavy eyebrows like those of some wild animal. He was not a prepossessing man. He was so bald that he was compelled to wear a skull-cap, and the edge of this showed beneath the brim of his chimney-pot hat. His face needed a razor; and the grey beard coming through the cuticle, gave a ghastly, bluish tint to the pallor of his countenance. His broadcloth coat—Mrs. Absalom called it a \"shadbelly\"—was greasy at the collar, and worn at the seams, and his waistcoat was stained with ambeer. His trousers, which were much too large for him, bagged at the knees, and his boots were run down at the heels. Though he was temperate to the last degree, he had the appearance of a man who is the victim of some artificial stimulant. \"What put that idea in your head, Mrs. Goodlett?\" he asked, after looking long and searchingly at Mrs. Absalom. \"Well, I allowed that when you was countin\u0027 out your cash, a thrip or two mought have slipped through the cracks in the floor,\" she replied; \"sech things have happened before now.\" He wiped his thin lips with his lean forefinger, and stood hesitating, whereupon Mrs. Absalom remarked: \"It sha\u0027n\u0027t cost you a cent ef you\u0027ll come in. Ab\u0027ll be here purty soon ef somebody ain\u0027t been fool enough to give him his dinner. His health\u0027ll fail him long before his appetite does. Show Mr. Tomlin in the parlour, Gabriel, an\u0027 I\u0027ll see about Ab\u0027s dinner; I don\u0027t want it to burn to a cracklin\u0027 before he gits it.\" Silas Tomlin went into the parlour and sat down, while Gabriel stood hesitating, not knowing what to do or say. He was embarrassed, and Silas Tomlin saw it. \"Oh, take a seat,\" he said, with a show of impatience. \"What are you doing for yourself, Tolliver? You\u0027re a big boy now, and you ought to be making good money. We\u0027ll all have to work now: we\u0027ll have to buckle right down to it. The way I look at it, the man who is doing nothing is throwing money away; yes, sir, throwing it away. What does Adam Smith say? Why, he says——\" Gabriel never found out what particular statement of Adam Smith was to be thrown at his head, for at that moment, Mr. Goodlett called out from the dining-room: \"Si Tomlin in there, Gabriel? Well, fetch him out here whar I live at. I ain\u0027t got no parlours for company.\" By the time that Gabriel had led Mr. Silas Tomlin into the dining-room, Mr. Goodlett had a plate of victuals carrying it to the kitchen; and he remarked as he went along, \"I got nuther parlours nor dinin\u0027-rooms: fetch him out here to the kitchen whar we both b\u0027long at.\" If Silas Tomlin objected to this arrangement, he gave no sign; he followed without a word, Mr. Goodlett placed his plate on the table where the dishes were washed, and dropped his hat on the floor beside him, and began to attack his dinner most vigorously. Believing, evidently, that ordinary politeness would be wasted here, Silas entered at once on the business that had brought him to Dorringtons\u0027. \"Sorry to trouble you, Goodlett,\" he said by way of making a beginning. \"I notice you ain\u0027t cryin\u0027 none to hurt,\" remarked Mr. Goodlett placidly. \"An\u0027 ef you was, you\u0027d be cryin\u0027 for nothin\u0027. You ain\u0027t troublin\u0027 me a mite. Forty an\u0027 four like you can\u0027t trouble me.\" \"You\u0027ll have to excuse Ab,\" said Mrs. Goodlett, who had preceded Gabriel and Silas to the kitchen. \"He\u0027s lost his cud, an\u0027 he won\u0027t be right well till he finds it ag\u0027in.\" She placed her hand over her mouth to hide her smiles. Silas Tomlin paid no attention to this by-play. He stood like a man who is waiting an opportunity to get in a word. \"Goodlett, who were the ladies you brought from Malvern to-day?\" His face was very serious. \"You know \u0027em lots better\u0027n I do. The oldest seed you out in the field, an\u0027 she axed me who you mought be. I told her, bekaze I ain\u0027t got no secrets from my passengers, specially when they\u0027re good-lookin\u0027 an\u0027 plank down the\u0027r money before they start. Arter I told \u0027em who you was, the oldest made you a mighty purty bow, but you wer\u0027n\u0027t polite enough for to take off your hat. I dunno as I blame you much, all things considered. Then the youngest, she\u0027s the daughter, she says, says she, \u0027Is that reely him, ma?\u0027 an\u0027 t\u0027other one, says she, \u0027Ef it\u0027s him, honey, he\u0027s swunk turrible.\u0027 She said them very words.\" \"I wonder who in the world they can be?\" said Silas Tomlin, as if talking to himself. \"You\u0027ll think of the\u0027r names arter awhile,\" Mr. Goodlett remarked by way of consolation, but his tone was so suspicious that Silas turned on his heel—he had started out—and asked Mr. Goodlett what he meant. \"Adzackly what I said, nuther more nor less.\" Mrs. Absalom was so curious to find out something more that Silas was hardly out of the house before she began to ply her husband with questions. But they were all futile. Mr. Goodlett knew no more than that he had brought the women from Malvern; that they had chanced to spy old Silas Tomlin in a field by the side of the road, and that when the elder of the two women found out what his name was, she made him a bow, which Silas wasn\u0027t polite enough to return. \"That\u0027s all I know,\" remarked Mr. Goodlett. \"Dog take the wimmen anyhow!\" he exclaimed indignantly; \"ef they\u0027d stay at home they\u0027d be all right; but here they go, a-trapesin\u0027 an\u0027 a-trollopin\u0027 all over creation, an\u0027 a-givin\u0027 trouble wherever they go. They git me so muddled an\u0027 befuddled wi\u0027 ther whickerin\u0027 an\u0027 snickerin\u0027 that I dunner which een\u0027 I\u0027m a-stannin\u0027 on half the time. Nex\u0027 time they want to ride wi\u0027 me, I\u0027ll say, \u0027Walk!\u0027 By jacks! I won\u0027t haul \u0027em.\" This episode, if it may be called such, made small impression on Gabriel\u0027s mind, but it tickled Mrs. Goodlett\u0027s mind into activity, and the lad heard more of Silas Tomlin during the next hour than he had ever known before. In a manner, Silas was a very important factor in the community, as money-lenders always are, but according to Gabriel\u0027s idea, he was always one of the poorest creatures in the world. When he was a young man, Silas joined the tide of emigration that was flowing westward. He went to Mississippi, where he married his first wife. In a year\u0027s time, he returned to his old home. When asked about his wife—for he returned alone—he curtly answered that she was well enough off. Mrs. Absalom was among those who made the inquiry, and her prompt comment was, \"She\u0027s well off ef she\u0027s dead; I\u0027ll say that much.\" But there was a persistent rumour, coming from no one knew where, that when a child was born to Silas, the wife was seized with such a horror of the father that the bare sight of him would cause her to scream, and she constantly implored her people to send him away. It is curious how rumours will travel far and wide, from State to State, creeping through swamps, flying over deserts and waste places, and coming home at last as the carrier-pigeon does, especially if there happens to be a grain of truth in them. It turned out that the lady, in regard to whom Silas Tomlin expressed such curiosity, was a Mrs. Claiborne, of Kentucky, who, with her daughter, had refugeed from point to point in advance of the Federal army. Finally, when peace came, the lady concluded to make her home in Georgia, where she had relatives, and she selected Shady Dale as her place of abode on account of its beauty. These facts became known later. Evidently the new-comers had resources, for they arranged to occupy the Gaither house, taking it as it stood, with Miss Polly Gaither, furniture and all. This arrangement must have been satisfactory to Miss Polly in the first place, or it would never have been made; and it certainly relieved her of the necessity of living on the charity of her neighbours, under pretence of borrowing from them. But so strange a bundle of contradictions is human nature, that no sooner had Miss Polly begun to enjoy the abundance that was now showered upon her in the shape of victuals and drink than she took her ear-trumpet in one hand and her work-bag in the other, and went abroad, gossiping about her tenants, telling what she thought they said, and commenting on their actions—not maliciously, but simply with a desire to feed the curiosity of the neighbours. In order to do this more effectually, Miss Polly returned visits that had been made to her before the war. There was nothing in her talk to discredit the Claibornes or to injure their characters. They were strangers to the community, and there was a natural and perfectly legitimate curiosity on the part of the town to learn something of their history. Miss Polly could not satisfy this curiosity, but she could whet it by leaving at each one\u0027s door choice selections from her catalogue of the sayings and doings of the new-comers—wearing all the time a dress that Miss Eugenia, the daughter, had made over for her. Miss Polly was a dumpy little woman, and, with her wen, her ear-trumpet, and her work-bag, she cut a queer figure as she waddled along. There was one piece of information she gave out that puzzled the community no little. According to Miss Polly, the Claibornes had hardly settled themselves in their new home before Silas Tomlin called on them. \"I can\u0027t hear as well as I used to,\" said Miss Polly—she was deaf as a door-post—\"but I can see as well as anybody; yes indeed, as well as anybody in the world. And I tell you, Lucy Lumsden\"—she was talking to Gabriel\u0027s grandmother—\"as soon as old Silas darkened the door, I knew he was worried. I never saw a grown person so fidgety and nervous, unless it was Micajah Clemmons, and he\u0027s got the rickets, poor man. So I says to myself, \u0027I\u0027ll watch you,\u0027 and watch I did. Well, when Mrs. Claiborne came into the parlour, she bowed very politely to old Silas, but I could see that she could hardly keep from laughing in his face; and I don\u0027t blame her, for the way old Silas went on was perfectly ridiculous. He spit and he spluttered, and sawed the air with his arms, and buttoned and unbuttoned his coat, and jerked at the bottom of his wescut till I really thought he\u0027d pull the front out. I wish you could have seen him, Lucy Lumsden, I do indeed. And when the door was shut on him, Mrs. Claiborne flung herself down on a sofa, and laughed until she frightened her daughter. I don\u0027t complain about my afflictions as a general thing, Lucy, but I would have given anything that day if my hearing had been as good as it used to be.\" And though Gabriel\u0027s grandmother was a woman of the highest principles, holding eavesdropping in the greatest contempt, it is possible that she would have owned to a mild regret that Miss Polly Gaither was too deaf to hear what Silas Tomlin\u0027s troubles were. This was natural, too, for, on account of the persistent rumours that had followed Silas home from Mississippi, there was always something of a mystery in regard to his first matrimonial venture. There was none about his second. A year or two after he returned home he married Susan Pritchard, whose father was a prosperous farmer, living several miles from town. Susan bore Silas a son and died. She was a pious woman, and with her last breath named the child Paul, on account of the conjunction of the names of Paul and Silas in the New Testament. Paul grew up to be one of the most popular young men in the community. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77494.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
