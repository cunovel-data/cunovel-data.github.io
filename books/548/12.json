{"id":23583,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER ELEVEN Mr. Sanders in His Cups","content":"When Nan came in sight of the court-house she saw a crowd of men and boys gazing at some spectacle on the side opposite her. Some were laughing, while others had serious faces. Among them she noticed Francis Bethune, and she also saw Gabriel, who was standing apart from the rest with a very gloomy countenance. Arriving near the crowd, she paused to discover what had excited their curiosity; and there before her eyes, seated on the court-house steps, was Mr. Billy Sanders, relating to an imaginary audience some choice incidents in his family history. His hat was off, and his face was very red. As Nan listened, he was telling how his \"pa\" and \"ma\" had married in South Carolina, and had subsequently moved to Jasper County in Georgia. In coming away (according to Mr. Sanders\u0027s version), they had fetched a half dozen hogs too many, and maybe a cow or two that didn\u0027t belong to them. By-and-by the owners of the stock appeared in the neighbourhood where Mr. Sanders, Sr., had settled, found the missing property, and carried him away with them. They had, or claimed to have, a warrant, and they hustled the pioneer off to South Carolina, and put him in jail. \"Now, Sally Hart was Nancy\u0027s own gal,\" said Mr. Sanders, pausing to take a nip from a bottle he carried in his pocket. \"She was a chip off\u0027n the old block ef they ever was a block that had a chip. So Sally (that was ma) she went polin\u0027 off to Sou\u0027 Ca\u0027liny. The night she got to whar she was agwine, she tore a hole in the side of the jail that you could \u0027a\u0027 driv a buggy through. Then she took poor pa by one ear, an\u0027 fetched him home. An\u0027 that ain\u0027t all. Arter she got him home, she took a rawhide an\u0027 liter\u0027ly wore pa out. She said arterwards that she didn\u0027t larrup him for fetchin\u0027 the stock off, but for layin\u0027 up there in jail an\u0027 lettin\u0027 his crap spile. Well, that frailin\u0027 made a good Christian of pa. He j\u0027ined the church, an\u0027 would \u0027a\u0027 been a preacher, but ma wouldn\u0027t let him. She allowed they\u0027d be too much gaddin\u0027 about, an\u0027 maybe a little too much honeyin\u0027 up wi\u0027 the sisterin\u0027. \u0027No,\u0027 says she, \u0027ef you want to do good prayin\u0027, pray whilst you\u0027re ploughin\u0027. I\u0027ll look arter the hoein\u0027 myself,\u0027 says she.\" Mr. Sanders was not regarded as a dangerous man in his cups, but on one well-remembered occasion he had fired into a crowd of men who were inclined to be too familiar, and since that day he had been given a wide berth when he took a seat on the court-house steps and began to recite his family history. While Nan stood there, Mr. Sanders drew a pistol from his pocket, and, smiling blandly, began to flourish it around. As he did so, Gabriel Tolliver sprang into the street and ran rapidly toward him. Some one in the crowd uttered a cry of warning. Seized by some blind impulse Nan ran after Gabriel. Francis Bethune caught her arm as she ran by him, but she wrenched herself from his grasp, and ran faster than ever. \"Stand back there!\" exclaimed Mr. Sanders in an angry voice, raising his pistol. For one brief moment, the spectators thought that Gabriel was doomed, for he went on without wavering. But he was really in no danger. Mr. Sanders had mistaken him for some of the young men who had been taunting him as they stood at a safe distance. But when he saw who it was, he replaced the pistol in his pocket, remarking, \"You ought to hang out your sign, Gabe. Ef I hadn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 had on my furseein\u0027 specks, I\u0027m afear\u0027d I\u0027d a plugged you.\" At that moment Nan arrived on the scene, her anger at white heat. She caught her breath, and then stood looking at Mr. Sanders, with eyes that fairly blazed with scorn and anger. \"Ef looks\u0027d burn, honey, they wouldn\u0027t be a cinder left of me,\" said Mr. Sanders, moving uneasily. \"Arter she\u0027s through wi\u0027 me, Gabriel, plant me in a shady place, an\u0027 make old Tar-Baby thar,\" indicating Tasma Tid, who had followed Nan—\"make old Tar-Baby thar set on my grave, an\u0027 warm it up once in awhile. I leave you my Sunday shirts wi\u0027 the frills on \u0027em, Gabriel, an\u0027 my Sunday boots wi\u0027 the red tops; an\u0027 have a piece put in the Malvern paper, statin\u0027 that I was one of the most populous and public-sperreted citizens of the county. An\u0027 tell how I went about killin\u0027 jimson weeds an\u0027 curkle-burrs for my neighbours by blowin\u0027 my breath on \u0027em.\" What Nan had intended to say, she left unsaid. Her feelings reacted while Mr. Sanders was talking, and she turned her back on him and began to cry. Under the circumstances, it was the very thing to do. Mr. Sanders\u0027s face fell. \"I\u0027ll tell you the honest truth, Gabriel—I never know\u0027d that anybody in the roun\u0027 world keer\u0027d a continental whether I was drunk or sober, alive or dead; an\u0027 I\u0027d lots ruther some un \u0027d stick a knife through my gizzard than to see that child cryin\u0027.\" He rose and went to Nan—he was not too tipsy to walk—and tried to lay his hand on her arm, but she whirled away from him. \"Honey,\" he said, \"what must I do? I\u0027ll do anything in the world you say.\" \"Go home and try to be decent,\" she answered. \"I will, honey, ef you an\u0027 Gabriel will go wi\u0027 me. I need some un for to keep the boogers off. You git on the lead side, honey, an\u0027 Gabriel, you be the off-hoss. Now, hitch on here\"—he held out both elbows, so that each could take him by an arm—\"an\u0027 when you\u0027re ready to start, give the word.\" Nan dried her eyes as quickly as she could, but before she would consent to go with Mr. Sanders, insisted on searching him. She found a flask of apple-brandy, and hurled it against the side of the court-house. \"Nan,\" he said ruefully, \"that\u0027s twice you\u0027ve broke my heart in a quarter of an hour. Ain\u0027t there some way you can break Gabriel\u0027s?\" He paused and sniffed the fumes of the apple-brandy. \"It\u0027s a mighty good thing court ain\u0027t in session,\" he remarked, \"bekaze the judge an\u0027 jury an\u0027 all the lawyers would come pourin\u0027 out for to smell at that wall there. You say they ain\u0027t no way for you to break Gabriel\u0027s heart, too?\" he asked again, turning to Nan. \"I just know my eyes are a sight,\" she said in reply. \"Are they red and swollen, Gabriel?\" \"They are somewhat red, but——\" \"But what?\" she asked, as Gabriel paused. \"They are just as pretty as ever.\" \"Mr. Sanders, that is the first compliment he ever paid me in his life.\" \"You\u0027ll remember it longer on that account,\" said Mr. Sanders. \"Gabriel is lazy-minded, but he\u0027ll brighten up arter awhile. Speakin\u0027 of fust an\u0027 last, an\u0027 things of that kind,\" he went on, \"I reckon this is the fust time I ever come betwixt you children. I hope no harm\u0027s done.\" \"Well, sir,\" said Nan, addressing Gabriel with a pretty formality, \"since you are kind enough to pay me a compliment, I\u0027ll be bold enough to ask you to take tea with me this evening; and I\u0027ll have no refusal.\" Gabriel found himself in an awkward predicament. He felt bound to discover what part the union League was playing. He had read of its sinister influence in other parts of the South, and he judged that the hour of its organisation at Shady Dale was the aptest time for such a discovery. He couldn\u0027t tell Nan what his plans were—he had no idea that she had already guessed them—and he hardly knew what to say. He was thoroughly uncomfortable. He was silent so long that Mr. Sanders had an opportunity to ask Nan if she hadn\u0027t made a remark to Gabriel. \"Yes; I asked him to tea,\" she replied in a low voice; \"he has forgotten it by this time.\" But Nan well knew why Gabriel was silent; she was neither vexed nor surprised at his hesitation. Nevertheless, she must play her part. \"Give him time, Nan; give him time,\" said Mr. Sanders, consolingly. \"Gabriel comes of a stuttering family. They say it took his grandma e\u0027en about seven year to tell Dick Lumsden she\u0027d have him. I lay Gabriel is composin\u0027 in his mind a flowery piece sorter like, \u0027Here\u0027s my heart, an\u0027 here\u0027s my hand; ef you ax me to tea, I\u0027m your\u0027n to command.\u0027\" \"I\u0027m sorry I can\u0027t come, Nan, but I can\u0027t; and it\u0027s just my luck that you should invite me to-day,\" said Gabriel, finally. \"You have another engagement?\" asked Nan. \"No, not an engagement,\" he replied. \"Well, you are going to do something very unnecessary and improper,\" said Nan, with the air and tone of a mature woman. \"You are sure to get into trouble. Why don\u0027t you ask your Mr. Bethune to take your place, or at least go with you?\" \"Why, you talk as if you knew what I am going to do,\" remarked Gabriel; \"but you couldn\u0027t guess in a week.\" At this point Mr. Sanders tried to stop in order to deliver an address. \"I bet you—I bet you a seven-pence ag\u0027in a speckled hen that Nan knows precisely what you\u0027re up to.\" But Nan and Gabriel pulled him along in spite of his frequently expressed desire to \"lay down in the road an\u0027 take a nap.\" \"It\u0027s a shame,\" he said, \"for a great big gal an\u0027 a great big boy to be harryin\u0027 a man as old as me. Why don\u0027t you ketch hands an\u0027 run to play? No, nothin\u0027 will do, but you must worry William H. Sanders, late of said county.\" He received no reply to this, and continued: \"I\u0027m glad I took too much, Gabriel, ef only for one thing. You know what I told you about Nan\u0027s temper—well, you\u0027ve seed it for yourself. She\u0027s frailed Frank, she\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 frailed me jest now ef you hadn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 been on hand, an\u0027 she\u0027ll frail you out before long. She\u0027s jest turrible.\" Mr. Sanders kept up his good-humour all the way home, and when he had been placed in charge of Uncle Plato, who knew how to deal with him, he said: \"Now, fellers, I had a mighty good reason for restin\u0027 my mind. You cried bekase old Billy Sanders was drunk, didn\u0027t you, Nan? Well, I\u0027m mighty glad you did. I never know\u0027d before that a sob or two would make a Son of Temperance of a man; but that\u0027s what they\u0027ll do for me. Nobody in this world will ever see me drunk ag\u0027in. So long!\" It may be said here that Mr. Sanders kept his promise. The events which followed required clear heads and steady hands for their shaping, but each crisis, as it arose, found Mr. Sanders, and a few others who acted with him, fully prepared to meet it, though there were times and occasions when he, as well as the rest, was overtaken by a profound sense of his helplessness. Some fell into melancholy, and some were overtaken by dejection, but Mr. Sanders never for a moment forgot to be cheerful. \"I don\u0027t suppose there is another girl in the country who would make such a spectacle of herself as I made to-day,\" said Nan, as she and Gabriel walked slowly in the direction of town. \"What do you mean?\" inquired Gabriel. \"You know well enough,\" replied Nan. \"Why, think of a young woman rushing across the public square in the face of a crowd, and doing as I did! I\u0027ll be the talk of the town. What is your opinion?\" \"Well, considering who the man was, and everything, I think it was very becoming in you,\" replied Gabriel. \"Oh, thank you!\" said Nan. \"Under the circumstances, you could say no less. You have changed greatly, Gabriel, since Eugenia Claiborne began to make eyes at you. You seem to think it is a mark of politeness to pay compliments right and left, and to agree with everybody. No doubt, if an invitation to tea had come from further up the street, you would have found some excuse for accepting.\" Nan\u0027s logic was quite feminine, but Gabriel took no advantage of that fact. \"I\u0027m sorry I can\u0027t come, Nan, and I hope you\u0027ll not be angry.\" \"Angry! why should I be angry?\" Nan exclaimed. \"An invitation to tea is not so important.\" \"But this one is important to me,\" said Gabriel. \"It is the first time you have asked me, and I hope it won\u0027t be the last.\" Nan said nothing more until she bade Gabriel good-bye at her father\u0027s gate. He thought she was angry, while she was wondering if he considered her bold.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77498.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
