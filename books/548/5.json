{"id":23576,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER FOUR Mr. Goodlett\u0027s Passengers","content":"The vehicle that Mr. Goodlett was driving was an old hack that had been used for long years to ply between Shady Dale and Malvern. On this occasion, Mr. Goodlett had for his passengers a lady and a young woman apparently about Nan\u0027s age. There was such a contrast between the two that Gabriel became absorbed in contemplating them; so much so that he failed to hear the greetings that passed between Mr. Goodlett and Mr. Sanders, who were old-time friends. The elder of the two women was emaciated to a degree, and her face was pale to the point of ghastliness; but in spite of her apparent weakness, there was an ease and a refinement in her manner, a repose and a self-possession that reminded Gabriel of his grandmother, when she was receiving the fine ladies from a distance who sometimes called on her. The younger of the two women, on the other hand, was the picture of health. The buoyancy of youth possessed her. She had an eager, impatient way of handling her fan and handkerchief, and there was a twinkle in her eye that spoke of humour; but her glance never fell directly on the men in the waggon; all her attention was for the invalid. Mr. Goodlett, his greeting over, was for pushing on, but the voice of the invalid detained him. \"Can you tell me,\" she said, turning to Mr. Sanders, \"whether the Gaither Place is occupied? Oh, but I forgot; you are just returning from that horrible, horrible war.\" She had lifted herself from a reclining position, but fell back hopelessly. \"Why, Ab thar ought to be able to tell you that,\" responded Mr. Sanders, his voice full of sympathy. \"Well, I jest ain\u0027t,\" declared Mr. Goodlett, with some show of impatience. \"I tell you, William, I been so worried an\u0027 flurried, an\u0027 so disqualified an\u0027 mortified, an\u0027 so het up wi\u0027 fust one thing an\u0027 then another, that I ain\u0027t skacely had time for to scratch myself on the eatchin\u0027 places, much less gittin\u0027 up all times er night for to see ef the Gaither Place is got folks or ha\u0027nts in it. When you\u0027ve been through what I have, William, you won\u0027t come a-axin\u0027 me ef the Gaither house is whar it mought be, or whar it oughter be, or ef it\u0027s popylated or dispopylated.\" The young lady stroked the invalid\u0027s hand and smiled. Something in the frowning face and fractious tone of the old man evidently appealed to her sense of humour. \"Don\u0027t you think it is absurd,\" said the pale lady, again appealing to Mr. Sanders, \"that a person should live in so small a town, and not know whether one of the largest houses in the place is occupied—a house that belongs to a family that used to be one of the most prominent of the county? Why, of course it is absurd. There is something uncanny about it. I haven\u0027t had such a shock in many a day.\" \"But, mother,\" protested the young lady, \"why worry about it? A great many strange things have happened to us, and this is the least important of all.\" \"Why, dearest, this is the strangest of all strange things. The driver here says he lives at Dorringtons\u0027, and the Gaither house is not so very far from Dorringtons\u0027.\" \"Everybody knows,\" said Gabriel, \"that Miss Polly Gaither lives in the Gaither house.\" He spoke before he was aware, and began to blush. Whereupon the young lady gave him a very bright smile. \"Humph!\" grunted Mr. Goodlett, giving the lad a severe look. He started to climb into his seat, but turned to Gabriel. \"Is she got a wen?\" he asked, with something like a scowl. \"Yes, she has a wen,\" replied the lad, blushing again, but this time for Mr. Goodlett. \"Well, then, ef she\u0027s got a wen, ef Polly Gaithers is got a wen, she\u0027s livin\u0027 in that house, bekaze, no longer\u0027n last Sat\u0027day, she come roun\u0027 for to borry some meal; an\u0027 whatsomever she use to have, an\u0027 whatsomever she mought have herearter, she\u0027s got a wen now, an\u0027 I\u0027ll tell you so on a stack of Bibles as high as the court-house.\" The young lady laughed, but immediately controlled herself with a half-petulant \"Oh dear!\" Laughter became her well, for it smoothed away a little frown of perplexity that had established itself between her eyebrows. \"Oh, we\u0027ll take the young man\u0027s word for it,\" said the invalid, \"and we are very much obliged to him. What is your name?\" When Gabriel had told her, she repeated the name over again. \"I used to know your grandmother very well,\" she said. \"Tell her Margaret Bridalbin has returned home, and would be delighted to see her.\" \"Then, ma\u0027am, you must be Margaret Gaither,\" remarked Mr. Sanders. \"Yes, I was Margaret Gaither,\" replied the invalid. \"I used to know you very well, Mr. Sanders, and if I had changed as little as you have, I could still boast of my beauty.\" \"Yet nobody hears me braggin\u0027 of mine, Margaret,\" said Mr. Sanders with a smile that found its reflection in the daughter\u0027s face; \"but I hope from my heart that home an\u0027 old friends will be a good physic for you, an\u0027 git you to braggin\u0027 ag\u0027in. Anyhow, ef you don\u0027t brag on yourself, you can take up a good part of the time braggin\u0027 on your daughter.\" \"Oh, thank you, sir, for the clever joke. My mother has told me long ago how full of fun you are,\" said the young lady, blushing sufficiently to show that she did not regard the compliment as altogether a joke. \"You may drive on now,\" she remarked to Mr. Goodlett. Whereupon that surly-looking veteran slapped his mismatched team with the loose ends of the reins, and the shabby old hack moved off toward Shady Dale. Mr. Sanders waited for the vehicle to get some distance ahead, and then he too urged his team forward. \"The word is Home,\" he said; \"I reckon Margaret has had her sheer of trouble, an\u0027 a few slices more. She made her own bed, as the sayin\u0027 is, an\u0027 now she\u0027s layin\u0027 on it. Well, well, well! when time an\u0027 occasions take arter you, it ain\u0027t no use to run; you mought jest as well set right flat on the ground an\u0027 see what they\u0027ve got ag\u0027in you.\" The remark was not original, nor very deep, but it recurred to Gabriel when trouble plucked at his own sleeve, or when he saw disaster run through a family like a contagion. In no long time the waggon reached the outskirts of the town, where the highway became a part of the wide street that ran through the centre of Shady Dale, flowing around the old court-house in the semblance of a wide river embracing a small island. Gabriel and Cephas were on the point of leaving the waggon here, but Mr. Sanders was of another mind. \"Ride on to Dorrin\u0027tons\u0027 wi\u0027 us,\" he said. \"I want to swap a joke or two wi\u0027 Mrs. Ab.\" \"She\u0027s sure to get the best of it,\" Gabriel warned him. \"Likely enough, but that won\u0027t spile the fun,\" responded Mr. Sanders. Mrs. Absalom, as she was called, was the wife of Mr. Goodlett, and was marked off from the great majority of her sex by her keen appreciation of humour. Her own contributions were spoiled for some, for the reason that she gave them the tone of quarrelsomeness; whereas, it is to be doubted whether she ever gave way to real anger more than once or twice in her life. She was Dr. Randolph Dorrington\u0027s housekeeper, and was a real mother to Nan, who was motherless before she had drawn a dozen breaths of the poisonous air of this world. By the time the waggon reached Dorrington\u0027s, Gabriel, acting on the instructions of Mr. Sanders, had crawled under the cover of the waggon, and was holding out a pair of old shoes, so that a passer-by would imagine that some one was lying prone in the waggon with his feet sticking out. When the waggon reached the Dorrington Place, Mr. Sanders drew rein, and hailed the house, having signed to Cephas to make himself invisible. Evidently Mrs. Absalom was in the rear, or in the kitchen, which was a favourite resort of hers, for the \"hello\" had to be repeated a number of times before she made her appearance. She came wiping her face on her ample apron, and brushing the hair from her eyes. She was always a busy housekeeper. \"We\u0027re huntin\u0027, ma\u0027am, for a place called Cloptons\u0027,\" said Mr. Sanders in a falsetto voice, his hat pulled down over his eyes; \"an\u0027 we\u0027d thank you might\u0027ly ef you\u0027d put us on the right road. About four mile back, we picked up a\u0027 old snoozer who calls himself William H. Sanders, an\u0027 he keeps on talkin\u0027 about the Clopton Place.\" \"Why, the Clopton Place is right down the road a piece. What in the world is the matter wi\u0027 old Billy?\" she inquired with real solicitude. \"Was he wounded in the war, or is he jest up to some of his old-time devilment?\" \"Well, ma\u0027am, from the looks of the jimmyjon we found by his side, he must \u0027a\u0027 shot hisself in the neck. He complains of cold feet, an\u0027 he\u0027s got \u0027em stuck out from under the kiver.\" \"Don\u0027t you worry about that,\" said Mrs. Absalom; \"the climate will never strike in on old Billy\u0027s feet till he gits better acquainted wi\u0027 soap an\u0027 water.\" \"An\u0027 he talks in his sleep about a Mrs. Absalom,\" Mr. Sanders went on, \"an\u0027 he cries, an\u0027 says she used to be his sweetheart, but he had to jilt her bekaze she can\u0027t cook a decent biscuit.\" \"The old villain!\" exclaimed Mrs. Absalom, with well simulated indignation; \"he can\u0027t tell the truth even when he\u0027s drunk. If he ever sobers up in this world, I\u0027ll give him a long piece of my mind. Jest drive on the way you\u0027ve started, an\u0027 ef you can keep in the middle of the road wi\u0027 that drunken old slink in the waggin, you\u0027ll come to Cloptons\u0027 in a mighty few minutes.\" At this juncture Mr. Sanders was obliged to laugh, whereupon, Mrs. Absalom, looking narrowly at the travellers, had no difficulty in recognising them. \"Well, my life!\" she exclaimed, raising her hands above her head in a gesture of amazement. \"Why, that\u0027s old Billy, an\u0027 him sober; and Franky Bethune, an\u0027 him not a primpin\u0027! Well, well! I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 never believed it ef I hadn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 seed it. I vow I\u0027m beginnin\u0027 to believe that war\u0027s a real good thing; it\u0027s like a revival meetin\u0027 for some folks. I\u0027m sorry Ab didn\u0027t take his gun an\u0027 jine in—maybe he\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 shed his stinginess. But I declare to gracious, I\u0027m glad to see you all; the sight of you is good for the sore eyes. An\u0027 Frank tryin\u0027 to raise a beard! Well, honey, I\u0027ll send you a bottle of bergamot grease to rub on it.\" Mrs. Absalom came out to the waggon and shook hands with the returned warriors very heartily, and, sharp as her tongue was, there were tears in her eyes as she greeted them; for in that region, nearly all had feelings of kinship for their neighbours and friends, and in that day and time, people were not ashamed of their emotions. \"Margaret Gaither has come back,\" remarked Mr. Sanders. \"Ab fetched her in his hack.\" \"Well, the poor creetur\u0027!\" exclaimed Mrs. Absalom; \"they say she\u0027s had trouble piled on her house-high.\" \"She won\u0027t have much more in this world ef looks is any sign,\" Mr. Sanders replied. \"She ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 but a livin\u0027 skeleton, but she\u0027s got a mighty lively gal.\" The waggon moved on and left Mrs. Absalom leaning on the gate, a position that she kept for some little time. Farther down the road, Gabriel, whose example was followed by Cephas, bade Mr. Sanders good-bye, nodded lightly to Francis Bethune, and jumped from the waggon. \"Wait a moment, Tolliver,\" said Bethune. \"I want you to come to see me—and bring Cephas with you. I am going to make you like me if I can. The home folks have been writing great things about you. Oh, you must come,\" he insisted, seeing that Gabriel was hesitating. \"I want to show you what a good fellow I can be when I try right hard.\" \"Yes, you boys must come,\" said Mr. Sanders; \"an\u0027 ef Frank is off courtin\u0027 that new gal—I ketched him cuttin\u0027 his eye at her—you can hunt me up, an\u0027 I\u0027ll tell you some old-time tales that\u0027ll make your hair stan\u0027 on end.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2803/77491.html","bookId":548,"book":{"id":548,"title":"Gabriel Tolliver A Story of Reconstruction","description":"简介： For several years Sophia had listened calmly to my glowing descriptions of Shady Dale and the people there.
