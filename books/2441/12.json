{"id":79243,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"FIRE ENGULFED and billowed around me. I\u0027d never in my worst nightmare imagined such heat. I almost opened my mouth to scream. If I had, fire would have gushed down my throat and torched me to a crisp from the inside out. When I burst through the other side of the fiery wall, my hair was a burning bush, and flames sprouted from my body like mushrooms. I dropped to the floor and rolled around, beating at my hair with my hands, extinguishing the flames. I paid no attention to the hisses and whistlings of the pipes. If flames had struck in those seconds of madness, they\u0027d have devoured me. But I got lucky... lucky Darren Shan... the luck of the vampires. Once I\u0027d slapped out the worst of the flames, I got to my knees, groaning weakly. Sucking in hot, thin air, I prodded gently at the smoldering mess on top of my head, making sure there were no sparks waiting to flare back to life. My entire body was black and red. Black from the soot, red where the burns had eaten through my flesh. I was in bad shape, but I had to go on. Sore as I was, and painful as it was to move, I had to. The ravenous demons of the fire would devour me if I didn\u0027t. Standing, I tuned out the roars of the flames and listened for the sounds of the pipes. It wasn\u0027t easy - my ears had been savagely burnt, affecting my sense of hearing - but I was able to detect the faintest hints of hissing and whistling, and after a few shaky steps I was back on course, anticipating the bursts of flames and moving to avoid them. The one good thing about wading through the wall of fire was that it had burnt out much of the feelings in my feet. There was almost no pain now beneath my knees. That meant I was dangerously singed, and part of me worried about what would happen after the Trial - if my feet were burnt beyond repair, they might have to be amputated! - but that was a worry for another time. Right now I was glad for the relief and took comfort from it. My ears were seriously troubling me. I tried to rub some spit on them, but my mouth had dried up completely. I caressed them gently between my fingers, but that made them worse. In the end I left them alone and just did my best to ignore them. The flames were forcing me into another corner. Rather than let myself get trapped again, I ducked through a roaring bank of fire and back to open ground, enduring the ensuing pain. I closed my eyes as often as possible, every time there was the slightest lull. The heat was dreadful for them. They\u0027d dried up the same way my mouth had, and I was afraid of losing my sight. As I rolled away from yet another nasty burst of fire, the flames in the Hall began to die away. I paused suspiciously. Was this the start of an even worse assault? Could I expect a huge ball of fire to burst through the pipes and blow me away? While I twitched and strained my ears, the door to the Hall swung open, and vampires in heavy capes entered. I stared at them as though they were aliens. What were they doing? Were they firemen who\u0027d lost their way? Someone should tell them they shouldn\u0027t be here. It was dangerous. I backed away from the vampires as they converged on me. I\u0027d have warned them to get out before the next big ball of fire hit, except I had no voice. I couldn\u0027t even manage a squeak. \"Darren, it is over,\" one of the vampires said. He sounded like Mr. Crepsley, but it couldn\u0027t be - Mr. Crepsley wouldn\u0027t wander into a Hall during the middle of a Trial. I waved a singed hand at the vampires and mouthed the words, \"Go away! Get out of here!\" \"Darren,\" the lead vampire said again, \"it is over. You won!\" I couldn\u0027t make sense of his words. All I knew was that a huge ball of fire was due, and if these fools were blocking my way, I\u0027d be incapable of dodging it. Hitting out at them, I tried weaving my way through their arms to safety. I ducked the grasp of the lead vampire, but the next caught me by the scruff of the neck. His touch was painful and I dropped to the floor, screaming silently. \"Be careful!\" the lead vampire snapped, then bent over me - it was Mr. Crepsley! \"Darren,\" he said softly, \"it is all right. You did it. You are safe.\" Shaking my head, unable to think clearly, I mouthed the same word over and over: \"Fire! Fire! Fire!\" I was still mouthing it when they lifted me onto a stretcher and carted me from the Hall. And even when we were outside, clear of the flames, and medics were tending to my wounds, I couldn\u0027t stop my lips from forming the word of warning, or my eyes from rolling to the left and right, fearfully searching for the telltale signs of red and yellow terror.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trials-of-death-the-saga-of-darren-shan-5/page-12.html","bookId":2441,"book":{"id":2441,"title":"Trials of Death (The Saga of Darren Shan #5)","description":"Storyline: The Saga of Darren Shan #5: Trials of Death The main character, Darren Shan, takes part in the Trials of Initiation.
