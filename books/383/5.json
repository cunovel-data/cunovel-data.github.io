{"id":16194,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER IV. LIFE AT THE BOARDING-HOUSE.","content":"Dick found his new quarters in Bleecker Street very comfortable. His room was kept in neat order, which was more than could be said of his former home in Mott Street. There once a fortnight was thought sufficient to change the sheets, while both boys were expected to use the same towel, and make that last a week. Indeed, Mrs. Mooney would have considered the boys \"mighty particular\" if they had objected to such an arrangement. Mrs. Browning, fortunately, was very different, and Dick found nothing to complain of either in his chamber or in the board which was furnished. Dick had felt rather awkward on his first appearance at the table, but he was beginning to feel more at his ease. It was rather remarkable, considering his past life, how readily he adapted himself to an experience so different. He left the store at five o\u0027clock, and got to his boarding-house in time to get ready for dinner. Dick had now got to be quite particular about his appearance. He washed his face and hands thoroughly, and brushed his hair carefully, before appearing at the table. Miss Peyton, the lively young lady who has already been mentioned in the first chapter, sat near the boys, and evidently was quite prepossessed in their favor. Both had bright and attractive faces, though Dick would undoubtedly be considered the handsomest. He had a fresh color which spoke of good health, and was well-formed and strong. Henry Fosdick was more delicate in appearance; his face was thinner, and rather pale. It was clear that he was not as well able to fight his way through life as Dick. But there was something pleasant and attractive in his quiet sedateness, as well as in the frank honesty and humor that could be read in the glance of our friend Dick. \"Won\u0027t you and your friend stop a little while and sing?\" asked Miss Peyton, addressing Henry Fosdick on the evening of the second day of Dick\u0027s business career. Fosdick hesitated. \"My friend has an engagement this evening,\" he said. \"I suppose I may not ask where,\" said she. \"I am invited to spend the evening with some friends on Madison Avenue,\" said Dick. \"Indeed?\" said Miss Peyton, surprised. \"I wasn\u0027t aware you had such fashionable friends, or I couldn\u0027t have expected to retain you.\" \"All my friends are not as fashionable,\" said Dick, wondering what the young lady would say if she could see his late fellow-lodgers at Mrs. Mooney\u0027s, on Mott Street. \"If I can\u0027t hope to keep you this evening, you must promise to stay awhile to-morrow evening. I hope to have the pleasure of hearing you sing, Mr. Hunter.\" \"When I give a concert,\" said Dick, \"I\u0027ll be sure to let you in gratooitous.\" \"Thank you,\" said Miss Peyton. \"I shall remind you of it. I hope that time will come very soon.\" \"Just as soon as I can engage the Academy of Music on reasonable terms.\" \"You\u0027d better try first in the parlor here. We\u0027ll take up a contribution, to pay you for your exertions.\" \"Thank you,\" said Dick. \"You\u0027re very kind, as the man said to the judge when he asked him when it would be perfectly agreeable for him to be hung.\" Miss Peyton laughed at this remark, and Dick went upstairs to get ready for his visit to Madison Avenue. Our hero felt a little bashful about this visit. He was afraid that he would do or say something that was improper, or that something would slip out which would betray his vagabond life of the streets. \"I wish you was going with me, Fosdick,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll get along well enough alone, Dick. Don\u0027t be afraid.\" \"You see I aint used to society, Fosdick.\" \"Nor I either.\" \"But it seems to come natural to you. I\u0027m always makin\u0027 some blunder.\" \"You\u0027ll get over that in time, Dick. It\u0027s because you have so much fun in you. I am more sober. Miss Peyton seems very much amused by your odd remarks.\" \"I have to talk so; I can\u0027t think of anything else to say.\" \"There\u0027s one thing, Dick, we mustn\u0027t give up at any rate.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"Studying. We don\u0027t either of us know as much as we ought to.\" \"That\u0027s so.\" \"You can see how much good studying has done for you so far. If it hadn\u0027t been for that, you wouldn\u0027t have been able to go into Mr. Rockwell\u0027s employment.\" \"That\u0027s true enough, Fosdick. I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t know enough now.\" \"You know enough to get along very well for the present, but you want to rise.\" \"You\u0027re right. When I get to be old and infirm I don\u0027t want to be an errand-boy.\" \"Nor I either. So, Dick, I think we had better make up our minds to study an hour or an hour and a half every evening. Of course, you can\u0027t begin this evening, but there are very few when you can\u0027t find the time.\" \"I\u0027ll send a circ\u0027lar to my numerous friends on Fifth Avenue and Madison, tellin\u0027 \u0027em how much I\u0027m obliged for their kind invitations, but the claims of literatoor and science can\u0027t be neglected.\" \"Do you know, Dick, I think it might be well for us to begin French?\" \"I wonder what Johnny Nolan would say if I should inquire after his health in the polly-voo language?\" \"It wouldn\u0027t be the first time you have astonished him.\" \"Well, Fosdick, I\u0027m in for it if you think it\u0027s best. Now tell me what necktie I shall wear?\" Dick displayed two. One was bright red with large figures, which he had bought soon after he began to board in Mott Street. The other was a plain black. \"You\u0027d better wear the black one, Dick,\" said Fosdick, whose taste was simpler and better than his friend\u0027s. \"It seems to me it don\u0027t look handsome enough,\" said Dick, whose taste had not yet been formed, and was influenced by the Bowery style of dress. \"It\u0027s more modest, and that is all the better.\" \"All right. I suppose you know best. Before I get ready I must give a new shine to my boots. I\u0027m going to make them shine so you can see your face in them.\" \"Better let me do that for you, Dick. I can do it while you\u0027re dressing, and that will save time.\" \"No, Fosdick, I was longer in the business than you, and none of the boys could beat me on shines.\" \"I don\u0027t know but you\u0027re right, Dick. I freely yield the palm to you in that.\" Dick stripped off his coat and vest and went to work with a will. He had never worked so hard for one of his old customers. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to give it a twenty-five cent shine,\" he said. Just then a knock was heard at the chamber-door. \"Come in!\" said Dick, pausing a moment in his labors. Mr. Clifton, a fellow-boarder, entered with a cigar in his mouth. \"Holloa,\" said he, \"what\u0027s up? Going to the theatre, Hunter?\" \"No,\" said Dick. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 out to spend the evening with some friends up in Madison Avenue.\" \"So I heard you say at the table, but I thought you were joking.\" \"No,\" said Dick; \"it\u0027s a fact.\" \"Seems to me you handle the brush pretty skilfully,\" remarked Mr. Clifton. \"I should almost think you had served a regular apprenticeship at it.\" \"So I have,\" answered Dick. \"Didn\u0027t you ever see me when I blacked boots on Chatham Square?\" \"Good joke!\" said the young man, who was far from supposing that Dick was in earnest. \"Oh, yes, of course I\u0027ve seen you often! Did you make money at it?\" \"I retired on a fortun\u0027,\" said Dick, \"and now I\u0027ve invested my capital in mercantile pursuits. There,\" and he took up one boot, and showed it to his visitor, \"did you ever see a better shine than that?\" \"No, I didn\u0027t, that\u0027s a fact,\" said Clifton, admiringly. \"You beat the young rascal I employ all hollow. I say, Hunter, if you ever go into the \u0027shine\u0027 business again, I\u0027ll be a regular customer of yours.\" \"He little thinks I\u0027ve blacked his boots before now,\" thought Dick. \"All right,\" said he, aloud. \"When a commercial crisis comes, and I fail in business, I think I\u0027ll remember your encouragin\u0027 offer, and remind you of it.\" \"Have a cigar either of you?\" asked Clifton, drawing out a case. \"Excuse my not offering it before.\" \"No, thank you,\" said Fosdick. \"Don\u0027t smoke, eh? Won\u0027t you have one, Hunter?\" \"No, thank you. Fosdick is my guardian, and he don\u0027t allow it.\" \"So you\u0027re a good boy. Well, I wish you a pleasant evening,\" and Clifton sauntered out to find some other companion. \"He wouldn\u0027t believe I\u0027d been a boot-black,\" said Dick, \"even after I told him. I knew he wouldn\u0027t, or I wouldn\u0027t have said so. Is my hair parted straight?\" \"Yes, it\u0027s all right.\" \"How\u0027s my cravat?\" \"It\u0027ll do. You\u0027re getting to be quite a dandy, Dick.\" \"I want to look respectable; got it right that time. When I visit Turkey I want to look as the turkeys do. Won\u0027t you go with me,—as far as the door, I mean?\" \"Yes, if you\u0027re going to walk.\" \"I\u0027d rather. I feel kind of nervous, and perhaps I\u0027ll walk it off.\" The two boys got their caps, and walked up Broadway on the west side. The lights were already lit, and the shop windows made a brilliant display. At intervals places of amusement opened wide their hospitable portals, and large placards presented tempting invitations to enter. They reached union Square, and, traversing it, again walked up Broadway to Madison Park. At the upper end of this park commences the beautiful avenue which bears the same name. Only about half a dozen blocks now required to be passed, when the boys found themselves opposite a residence with a very imposing front. \"This is the place,\" said Dick. \"I wish you were going in with me.\" \"I hope you will have a pleasant time, Dick. Good-by till I see you again.\" Dick felt a little nervous, but he summoned up all his courage, and, ascending the broad marble steps, rang the bell. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2965/81605.html","bookId":383,"book":{"id":383,"title":"Fame and Fortune or, The Progress of Richard Hunter","description":"简介： Fame and Fortune, like its predecessor, Ragged Dick, was contributed as a serial story to the Schoolmate, a popular juvenile magazine published in Boston.
