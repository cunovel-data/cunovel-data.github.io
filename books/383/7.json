{"id":16196,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI. MR. GILBERT IS ASTONISHED.","content":"When Dick woke up in the morning the first thing he thought of was his watch, the next the check which he had received from Mr. Rockwell. \"I\u0027ll go to the bank this morning, and get my money,\" said he. \"How are you going to invest it, Dick?\" asked Fosdick. \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Dick. \"I\u0027ll put it in the savings bank till I decide. That\u0027ll make more\u0027n eleven hundred dollars. I didn\u0027t use to think I ever\u0027d be worth that, when I slept in boxes and old wagons.\" \"Eleven hundred dollars at six per cent. interest will yield you sixty-six dollars a year.\" \"So it will,\" said Dick, \"and all without working. I tell you what, Fosdick, at this rate I\u0027ll soon be a man of fortune.\" \"Yes, if you can make a thousand dollars a day.\" \"I wonder what old Gilbert\u0027ll say when he sees it,\" said Dick. \"Who\u0027s he?\" \"He\u0027s the book-keeper. He aint very fond of me.\" \"What has he against you?\" \"He thinks I don\u0027t treat him with proper respect,\" said Dick. \"Besides he tried to get his cousin Roswell Crawford in, but he couldn\u0027t.\" \"Then it seems both of us have interfered with Roswell.\" \"He\u0027s got a place now. I guess he\u0027s the senior partner by the way he talks.\" The breakfast-bell rang, and the boys went down to breakfast. Clifton was down already, and was standing in front of stove. Being an observing young man he at once noticed Dick\u0027s watch-chain. \"Halloa, Hunter!\" said he; \"I didn\u0027t know you had a watch.\" \"I didn\u0027t know it myself till last night,\" said Dick. \"Where did you get it?\" \"It came from Ball \u0026 Black\u0027s,\" said our hero, willing to mystify him. \"That\u0027s a nice chain,â€”solid gold, eh?\" \"Do you think I\u0027d wear anything else?\" asked Dick, loftily. \"Will you allow me to look at the watch?\" \"Certainly,\" said Dick, drawing it from his pocket, and submitting it to Clifton\u0027s inspection. \"It\u0027s a regular beauty,\" said the young man, enthusiastically. \"Do you mind telling how much you paid for it?\" \"How much do you think?\" \"A hundred dollars?\" \"It cost all of that,\" said Dick, confidently. \"If you see one for sale at that price, just let me know, and I\u0027ll buy it for a speculation.\" \"You must be getting a pretty good salary to buy such a watch as that.\" \"Pretty good,\" said Dick, carelessly. Mr. Clifton was rather a shallow young man, who was fond of show, and had a great respect for those who were able to make it. When Dick first came to the boarding-house he looked down upon him as a boy; but now that he proved to be the possessor of an elegant gold watch and chain, and might, therefore, be regarded as in prosperous circumstances, he conceived a high respect for him. The truth was that Clifton himself only got two dollars a week more than Dick, yet he paid eight dollars a week for board, and spent the rest in dress. His reputation among tailors was not the best, being always more ready to order new clothes than to pay for them. While they were talking the rest of the boarders entered, and breakfast commenced. Miss Peyton was there, of course. \"How did you find your friends in Madison Avenue last evening, Mr. Hunter?\" she inquired. \"They were all up and dressed,\" said Dick. \"They sent their partic\u0027lar regards to you.\" \"Oh, you wicked story-teller!\" simpered Miss Peyton; \"just as if I\u0027d believe such nonsense. Have they got a nice house?\" \"Beautiful,\" said Dick. \"I haven\u0027t seen any like it since I called on Queen Victoria last year.\" \"How is the house furnished?\" \"Well,\" said Dick, \"as near as I can remember, there\u0027s diamonds worked in the carpet, and all the tables and chairs is of gold. They\u0027d be rather hard to set on if it twan\u0027t for the velvet cushions.\" \"Aint you afraid to tell such stories, Mr. Hunter? Mr. Fosdick, you will have to talk to your friend.\" \"I am afraid it wouldn\u0027t do much good, Miss Peyton, if you fail to cure him.\" \"Mr. Hunter has just been investing in a handsome watch,\" remarked Clifton, passing his cup for a second cup of coffee. \"Oh, do let me look at it! I dote on watches,\" said Miss Peyton. \"Certainly,\" said Dick; and he detached the chain from his button-hole, and passed the watch across the table. \"It\u0027s a perfect little love,\" said Miss Peyton, enthusiastically. \"Isn\u0027t it, Mrs. Browning?\" \"It is very beautiful, certainly,\" said the landlady. She could not help feeling surprised that Dick, who, it will be remembered, had represented himself at his first visit to be in limited circumstances, and now occupied one of her cheapest rooms, could afford to purchase an article which was evidently so costly. \"Where did you buy it, Mr. Hunter?\" asked another boarder. \"I did not buy it at all,\" said Dick, deciding to let it be known how it came into his possession. \"It was given to me.\" \"Perhaps you\u0027ll mention my name to the person that gave it to you,\" said Mr. Clifton. \"If he\u0027s got any more to dispose of in that way, I should like to come in for one.\" \"How do you know but it may have come from a lady friend, Mr. Clifton?\" said Miss Peyton, slyly. \"How is that, Hunter?\" \"I haven\u0027t had any presents from any of my lady friends yet,\" said Dick. \"Perhaps I may some time.\" \"You don\u0027t mean anybody in particular, of course, Mr. Hunter?\" said Miss Peyton. \"Oh, no, of course not.\" This conversation may seem scarcely worth recording, but it will serve to illustrate the character of Dick\u0027s fellow-boarders. Miss Peyton was rather silly and affected, but she was good-natured, and Dick felt more at home with her than he would have done had she been a lady like Mrs. Rockwell, for instance. It got to be the custom with Dick and Fosdick to remain in the parlor a short time after supper, or rather dinner, for this was the third meal, and Fosdick joined the young lady in singing. Dick unfortunately had not been gifted by nature with a voice attuned to melody, and he participated only as a listener, in which capacity he enjoyed the entertainment. After breakfast Dick set out for the store as usual. He felt unusually happy and independent as he walked along. The check in his pocket made him feel rich. He wondered how it would be best to invest his money so as to yield him the largest return. He wisely decided to take Mr. Murdock, the head clerk, into his confidence, and ask his advice upon this point. When Dick arrived at the store neither Mr. Gilbert nor Mr. Murdock had yet arrived. Half an hour later the latter came, and five minutes after him the book-keeper. The latter noticed that the morning paper appeared to have been disturbed, and, glad of any opportunity to find fault with Dick, said, angrily, \"So you\u0027ve been reading the paper instead of minding your work, have you? I\u0027ll report you to Mr. Rockwell.\" \"Thank you,\" said Dick, \"you\u0027re very kind. Are you sure I read the paper? Is there any news missin\u0027 out of it?\" \"You\u0027re an impudent boy,\" said the book-keeper, provoked. He wanted to overawe Dick; but somehow Dick wouldn\u0027t be overawed. Evidently he did not entertain as much respect for the book-keeper as that gentleman felt to be his due. That a mere errand-boy should bandy words with a gentleman in his position seemed to Mr. Gilbert highly reprehensible. \"You\u0027re an impudent boy!\" repeated Gilbert, sharply, finding Dick did not reply to his first charge. \"I heard you make that remark before,\" said Dick, quietly. Now there was nothing out of the way in Dick\u0027s tone, which was perfectly respectful, and he only stated a fact; but the book-keeper became still more angry. \"Who rumpled that paper?\" he asked. \"Suppose you ask Mr. Murdock?\" said Dick. \"Did he come in here?\" asked Gilbert, cooling down, for it was against Dick that his charge was made, and not against the head clerk. As to the paper, he really cared nothing. \"Yes,\" said Dick. \"Then it\u0027s all right. I supposed you had been idling your time over the paper. Go and ask Mr. Murdock what time it is. I left my watch at home.\" \"It\u0027s half past eight,\" said Dick, drawing out his watch. Up to this time the book-keeper had not noticed Dick\u0027s watch-chain. Now that his attention was drawn not only to that, but to the beautiful gold watch which Dick carried, he was not a little surprised. \"Whose watch is that?\" he asked, abruptly. \"Mine,\" said Dick, briefly, rather enjoying the book-keeper\u0027s surprise. \"How did you come by it?\" \"Honestly,\" said Dick. \"Is it gold, or only plated?\" \"It\u0027s gold.\" \"Humph! Did you buy it, or was it given you?\" \"Well,\" said Dick, \"I didn\u0027t buy it.\" \"Did you say it was yours?\" \"Yes.\" Gilbert looked at Dick in surprise. Our hero was becoming more and more an enigma to him. That a boy in Dick\u0027s position should have a gold watch given him, especially now that he had learned from his cousin Roswell the nature of Dick\u0027s former employment, seemed indeed wonderful. \"Let me look at your watch a minute,\" he said. Dick handed it to him. \"It seems to be a very good one,\" he said. \"Yes,\" said Dick; \"I aint proud. It\u0027s as good as I want to wear.\" \"It looks entirely out of place on such a boy as you,\" said the book-keeper, sharply. \"Perhaps it would look better on you,\" suggested our hero, innocently. \"Yes, it would be more appropriate for me to wear than you. You\u0027re not old enough to be trusted with a watch; least of all with such a good one as that.\" \"Perhaps you\u0027d be kind enough to mention it to the one that gave it to me.\" \"Whoever gave it to you didn\u0027t show much judgment,\" said Gilbert, in the same pleasant way. \"Who was it?\" \"It was Mrs. Rockwell.\" If a bombshell had exploded in the office, it could hardly have taken Gilbert more by surprise. \"Who did you say?\" he repeated, thinking his ears might have deceived him. \"Mrs. Rockwell,\" said Dick, once more. The book-keeper could hardly suppress a low whistle. \"When did she give it to you?\" \"Last evening.\" \"Were you up there?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did Mr. Rockwell invite you?\" \"Yes.\" Just then Dick was called away by Mr. Murdock, who had some work for him to do. \"There\u0027s something mighty queer in all this,\" thought the book-keeper. \"What Mr. Rockwell can see in that boy, I don\u0027t understand. He\u0027s an impudent young rascal, and I\u0027ll get him turned off if it\u0027s a possible thing.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2965/81607.html","bookId":383,"book":{"id":383,"title":"Fame and Fortune or, The Progress of Richard Hunter","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š Fame and Fortune, like its predecessor, Ragged Dick, was contributed as a serial story to the Schoolmate, a popular juvenile magazine published in Boston.
