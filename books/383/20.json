{"id":16209,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. ANOTHER ARREST.","content":"Micky Maguire, as the reader will remember, was by no means satisfied with the compensation he received from Gilbert for his share in the plot which came so near proving disastrous to our friend Dick. He felt that the book-keeper had acted meanly to him, and he meant to have his revenge if a good opportunity should ever offer. He was very much disappointed to think he must do without the watch which he had set his heart upon. He would have felt no particular scruples against stealing it, but that would be rather dangerous. He began to wish he had kept the pocket-book. Very probably it contained more than enough to buy the watch. But, in spite of his disappointment, he had one satisfaction. He had avenged himself upon Dick, whom he had long disliked. He knew nothing of Tim Ryan\u0027s testimony, and supposed there was no doubt of Dick\u0027s conviction. He would like very well to have been present at the trial; but he had unpleasant associations connected with the court-room at the Tombs, having figured there on several occasions in an important but not very enviable capacity. As he was standing by the park railings, his particular friend and admirer, Limpy Jim, came up. \"Mornin\u0027, Jim,\" said Micky. \"What luck?\" \"None at all,\" said Jim. \"I haven\u0027t had a shine yet, and I\u0027m precious hungry.\" \"Come and take breakfast with me,\" said Micky, in an unusual fit of generosity; for he was generally more willing to be treated than to treat. \"Have you got stamps enough?\" \"Look at this,\" and Micky displayed the bill which he had received from Gilbert. \"You\u0027re in luck, Micky. Did you make all that by shines?\" \"Never mind how I made it. I guess it\u0027s good. Come along if you\u0027re hungry.\" Limpy Jim followed Micky across Printing-House Square to a cheap restaurant on Nassau Street, between Ann and Beekman Streets, and they were soon partaking with relish of a breakfast which, as they were not very fastidious, proved abundantly satisfactory. \"I\u0027ve got some news,\" said Micky, after he had drained his cup of coffee. \"You haven\u0027t forgot Ragged Dick, have ye?\" \"He\u0027s set up for a gentleman. I saw him a week ago strutting round as if he lived on Fifth Avenue.\" \"Well, he\u0027s set up for something else now.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"A pick-pocket.\" \"What?\" asked Jim, amazed. \"He stole an old chap\u0027s pocket-book yesterday afternoon, and I seed a policeman haulin\u0027 him off to the p\u0027lice station.\" \"That\u0027s where he gets his good clo\u0027es from?\" suggested Jim. \"Most likely. I expect he\u0027s on his way to the Island by this time.\" \"Serve him right for puttin\u0027 on airs. He won\u0027t pretend to be so much better than the rest of us now.\" \"Wonder what Tom Wilkins\u0027ll say? He\u0027s a great friend of Dick\u0027s.\" \"He\u0027s a sneak,\" said Micky. \"That\u0027s so. I wanted to borrer a shillin\u0027 of him last week, and he wouldn\u0027t lend it to me.\" This Tom Wilkins was a boot-black like the two who were expressing so unfavorable an opinion of his character. He had a mother and two sisters partially dependent upon him for support, and faithfully carried home all his earnings. This accounts for his being unwilling to lend Limpy Jim, who had no one to look out for but himself, and never considered it necessary to repay borrowed money. Tom had reason to feel friendly to Dick, for on several occasions, one of which is mentioned in the first volume of this series, Dick had given him help in time of need. He was always ready to defend Dick, when reviled by Micky and his followers, and had once or twice been attacked in consequence. Limpy Jim was right in supposing that nothing would disturb Tom more than to hear that his friend had got into trouble. Micky, who was in a generous mood, bought a couple of cheap cigars, of which he presented one to his satellite. These were lighted, and both boys, feeling more comfortable for the hearty meal of which they had partaken, swaggered out into the street. They re-entered the park, and began to look out for patrons. \"There\u0027s Tom Wilkins now,\" said Limpy Jim. Tom was busily engaged in imparting a scientific shine to the boots of an old gentleman who was sitting on one of the wooden seats to be found in the neighborhood of the City Hall. When he had completed his task, and risen from his knees, Limpy Jim advanced towards him, and said, with a sneer, \"I\u0027ve heard fine news about your friend Dick.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" asked Tom. \"He\u0027s got nabbed by a \u0027copp.\u0027\" \"I don\u0027t believe it,\" said Tom, incredulously. \"Isn\u0027t it so, Micky?\" said Jim, appealing to his friend. \"Yes, it\u0027s true. I seed him hauled off for pickin\u0027 an old fellow\u0027s pocket in Chatham Street.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it,\" repeated Tom; but he began to feel a little uneasy. \"I saw him and spoke to him yesterday mornin\u0027.\" \"What if you did? It didn\u0027t happen till afternoon.\" \"Dick wouldn\u0027t steal,\" said Tom, stoutly. \"He\u0027ll find it mighty hard work provin\u0027 that he didn\u0027t,\" said Micky. \"You won\u0027t see him for the next three months.\" \"Why won\u0027t I?\" \"Because he\u0027ll be at the Island. Maybe you\u0027ll go there yourself.\" \"If I do, it\u0027ll be for the first time,\" retorted Tom; \"and that\u0027s more than either of you can say.\" As this happened to be true, it was of course regarded as offensive. \"Shut up, Tom Wilkins!\" said Micky, \"if you don\u0027t want a lickin\u0027.\" \"None of your impudence!\" said Limpy Jim, emboldened by the presence and support of Micky, who was taller and stronger than Tom. \"I\u0027ve only told the truth,\" said Tom, \"and you can\u0027t deny it.\" \"Take that for your impudence!\" said Micky, drawing off, and hitting Tom a staggering blow on the side of the head. Limpy Jim was about to assist Micky, when there was a very unlooked-for interruption. Micky Maguire was seized by the collar, and, turning indignantly, found himself in the grip of a policeman. \"So you are fighting, are you, my fine fellow?\" demanded the guardian of the public peace. \"He insulted me,\" said Micky, doggedly, not attempting resistance, which he knew would be ineffectual. \"Didn\u0027t he, Jim?\" But Jim had already disappeared. He had a prejudice, easily accounted for, against the metropolitan police, and had as little communication with them as possible. \"I don\u0027t know anything about that,\" said the policeman. \"All I know is that you\u0027re wanted.\" \"Just for hittin\u0027 him? I didn\u0027t hurt him any.\" \"He didn\u0027t hurt me much,\" said Tom, generously, not desiring to see Micky get into trouble on his account. \"He says I didn\u0027t hurt him,\" urged Micky. \"Can\u0027t you let me go?\" \"That isn\u0027t what I want you for,\" said the policeman. Micky was astonished. The real cause of his arrest never once occurred to him, and he could not understand why he was \"wanted.\" \"What is it, then?\" he asked in some surprise. \"What \u0027ave I been doin\u0027?\" \"Perhaps you don\u0027t remember relieving an old gentleman of his pocket-book yesterday in Chatham Street.\" \"\u0027Twasn\u0027t me.\" \"Who was it then?\" \"Ragged Dick,—the feller that was took at the time. I seed him pick the man\u0027s pocket.\" \"It seems that you remember something about it.\" \"But it was Dick that did it. If he says I did it, he lies.\" \"I\u0027ve nothing to do with that. You must tell your story to the judge.\" \"Has he let Dick go?\" \"Yes.\" Micky received this intelligence with dismay. Somehow it had got out that he was the real thief, and he began to think that his chance of getting off was small. Just then, while in custody of the policeman, he saw advancing towards him the man who had inveigled him into the plot,—Gilbert, the book-keeper. His anger against Gilbert overcame his prudence, and he said, \"Well, if I did take the pocket-book, I was paid for doin\u0027 it, and that was the man that hired me.\" With some surprise, the policeman listened to this story. \"If you don\u0027t believe me, just wait till I speak to him.\" \"Mr. Gilbert!\" called Micky. Gilbert, who had not till now noticed his confederate, looked up, and, rapidly understanding what had happened, determined upon his course. \"Who speaks to me?\" he said, quietly. \"You\u0027ve got me into trouble, Mr. Gilbert,\" said Micky, \"and I want you to get me out of it.\" \"What does he mean?\" asked Gilbert, coolly, addressing the policeman. \"You hired me to steal a man\u0027s pocket-book, and I\u0027m took up for it,\" said Micky. \"I want you to help me, or I\u0027ll be sent to the Island.\" \"The boy must be crazy,\" said Gilbert, shrugging his shoulders. \"You give me a dollar to do it,\" said Micky, very much incensed at the desertion of his confederate. \"Do you know the boy?\" asked the policeman respectfully, for he put no faith in Micky\u0027s statement. \"He blacked my boots once,\" said Gilbert. \"That\u0027s all I know about him. What is he arrested for?\" \"For picking pockets. There was another boy arrested on suspicion, but it appeared on trial that he was innocent, and that this boy really took the wallet.\" \"He looks like a young scamp,\" said Gilbert, coolly. \"I\u0027m much obliged to him for introducing my name into the matter. I hope he\u0027ll get his desserts.\" This was too much for Micky\u0027s patience. He assailed Gilbert with such a shower of oaths that the policeman tightened his grip, and shook him vigorously. Gilbert shrugged his shoulders, and walked off with apparent unconcern. \"Wait till I get free,\" said Micky, furiously. \"I\u0027ll fix him.\" In regard to Micky, I have only to say further at this time, that he was at once conveyed to the Tombs, summarily tried and convicted, and spent the same night on Blackwell\u0027s Island, where we leave him for three months. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2965/81620.html","bookId":383,"book":{"id":383,"title":"Fame and Fortune or, The Progress of Richard Hunter","description":"简介： Fame and Fortune, like its predecessor, Ragged Dick, was contributed as a serial story to the Schoolmate, a popular juvenile magazine published in Boston.
