{"id":16205,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XV. THE FRANKLIN STREET STATION-HOUSE.","content":"The station-house to which Dick had been conveyed is situated in that part of Franklin Street which lies between Centre and Baxter Streets. The last is one of the most wretched streets in the city, lined with miserable tenement houses, policy shops, and second-hand clothing stores. Whoever passes through it in the evening, will do well to look to the safety of his pocket-book and watch, if he is imprudent enough to carry either in a district where the Ten Commandments are unknown, or unregarded. The station-house is an exception to the prevailing squalidness, being kept with great neatness. Mr. Murdock ascended the steps, and found himself in a large room, one side of which was fenced off by a railing. Behind this was a desk, at which sat the officer in charge. To him, Mr. Murdock directed himself. \"Have you a boy, named Richard Hunter, in the house?\" \"Yes,\" said the sergeant, referring to his minutes. \"He was brought in this afternoon, charged with picking a gentleman\u0027s pocket.\" \"There is some mistake about this. He is as honest as I am.\" \"I have nothing to do with that. He will have a fair trial to-morrow morning. All I have to do is to keep him in safe custody till then.\" \"Of course. Where is he?\" \"In a cell below.\" \"Can I see him?\" \"If you wish.\" The officer summoned an attendant, and briefly ordered him to conduct Mr. Murdock to Dick\u0027s cell. \"This way, sir,\" said the attendant. Mr. Murdock followed him through a large rear room, which is intended for the accommodation of the officers. Then, descending some steps into the courtyard, he descended thence into the apartments in the basement. Here are the cells for the temporary detention of offenders who are not at once sent to the Tombs for trial. The passages are whitewashed and the cells look very neat. They are on either side, with a grating, so that one passing along can look into them readily. They are probably about seven feet long, by four or five in width. A narrow raised bedstead, covered with a pallet, occupies one side, on which the prisoner can either lie or sit, as he pleases. \"How are you, boss?\" asked a negro woman, who had been arrested for drunkenness, swaying forward, as Mr. Murdock passed, and nearly losing her balance as she did so. \"Can\u0027t you give me a few cents to buy some supper?\" Turning from this revolting spectacle, Mr. Murdock followed his guide to the second cell beyond where our hero was confined. \"Is it you, Mr. Murdock?\" exclaimed our hero, joyfully jumping to his feet. \"I am glad to see you.\" \"And I am glad to see you; but I wish it were somewhere else,\" said Mr. Murdock. \"So do I,\" said Dick. \"I aint partial to this hotel, though the accommodations is gratooitous, and the company is very select.\" \"I see you will have your joke, Dick, even in such a place.\" \"I don\u0027t feel so jolly as I might,\" said Dick. \"I never was in the station-house before; but I shall be lucky if I don\u0027t get sent to a worse place.\" \"Have you any idea who took the wallet which was found in your pocket?\" \"No,\" said Dick. \"Do you know a boy called Micky Maguire?\" proceeded Mr. Murdock. \"Yes,\" said Dick, looking up in surprise. \"Micky used to be a great friend of mine. He\u0027d be delighted if he only knew that I was enjoyin\u0027 the hospitality of the government.\" \"He does know it,\" said Mr. Murdock, quietly. \"How do you know?\" asked Dick, quickly. \"Because it was he that stole the wallet and put it in your pocket.\" \"How did you find out?\" asked Dick, eagerly. \"Do you know a boy named Tim Ryan?\" \"Yes; he\u0027s a good boy.\" \"It was he that brought me your note. He saw the whole proceeding.\" \"Why didn\u0027t he tell, and stop my bein\u0027 arrested, then?\" \"I asked him that; but he said he was afraid Micky would beat him when he found out. But he is a friend of yours, and he stands ready to testify what he knows, at your trial, to-morrow morning.\" \"That\u0027s lucky,\" said Dick, breathing a sigh of relief. \"So it was Micky that served me the trick. He always loved me like a brother, Micky did, but I didn\u0027t expect he\u0027d steal for my benefit. I\u0027m very much obliged to him, but I\u0027d rather dispense with such little favors another time.\" \"You will be surprised to learn that Micky came round to our store this afternoon.\" \"What for?\" questioned Dick, in amazement. \"I don\u0027t know whether he came by accident or design; but Mr. Gilbert employed him to black his boots.\" \"Mr. Gilbert!\" \"Yes. They seemed to be conversing earnestly; but I was too far off to hear what was said. Finally, Gilbert appeared to get angry, and drove the boy out.\" \"That\u0027s strange!\" said Dick, thoughtfully. \"Mr. Gilbert loves me about as much as Micky does.\" \"Yes, there seems to be some mystery about it. We may find out some time what it is. But here is your friend Fosdick.\" \"How are you, Fosdick?\" hailed Dick from his cell. \"I\u0027m holdin\u0027 a little levee down here. Did you receive my card of invitation?\" \"I\u0027ve been uneasy all the afternoon, Dick,\" said Fosdick. \"Ever since I heard that you were here, I\u0027ve been longing to come and see you.\" \"Then you aint ashamed of me, even if I am in the station-house?\" \"Of course I know you don\u0027t deserve to be here. Tell me all about it. I only got a chance to speak a minute with Tim Ryan, for there were customers waiting.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you all I know myself,\" said Dick. \"I\u0027m sorry to keep you standing, but the door is locked, and I\u0027ve accidentally lost the key. So I can\u0027t invite you into my parlor, as the spider invited the fly.\" \"Don\u0027t stand on ceremony, Dick. I\u0027d just as lieves stay outside.\" \"So would I,\" said Dick, rather ruefully. The story was told over again, with such new light as Mr. Murdock had been able to throw upon it. \"It\u0027s just like Micky,\" said Fosdick. \"He\u0027s a bad fellow.\" \"It was rather a mean trick,\" said Dick; \"but he hasn\u0027t had a very good bringin\u0027 up, or maybe he\u0027d be a better boy.\" That he should have spoken thus, at the moment when he was suffering from Micky\u0027s malice, showed a generosity of feeling which was characteristic of Dick. No one was more frank, open, or free from malice than he, though always ready to stand up for his rights when he considered them assailed. It is this quality in Dick, joined to his manly spirit, which makes him a favorite with me, as he is also with you, let me hope, young reader. \"It\u0027ll come out right, Dick,\" said Fosdick, cheerfully. \"Tim Ryan\u0027s testimony will clear you. I feel a good deal better about it now than I did this afternoon, when I didn\u0027t know how things were likely to go with you.\" \"I hope so,\" said Dick. \"But I\u0027m afraid you won\u0027t get any supper, if you stay any longer with me.\" \"How about your supper, Dick?\" asked Fosdick, with sudden thought. \"Do they give you any in this establishment?\" \"No,\" said Dick; \"this hotel\u0027s on the European system, with improvements. You get your lodgin\u0027 for nothing, and nothing to eat along with it. I don\u0027t like the system much. I don\u0027t think I could stand it more\u0027n a week without its hurtin\u0027 my constitution.\" \"I\u0027ll go out and get you something, Dick,\" said Fosdick, \"if the rules of the establishment allow it. Shall I?\" \"Well,\" said Dick, \"I think I might eat a little, though the place isn\u0027t very stimulatin\u0027 to the appetite.\" \"What shall I bring you?\" \"I aint particular,\" said Dick. Just then the attendant came along, and Fosdick inquired if he would be allowed to bring his friend something to eat. \"Certainly,\" was the reply. \"We provide nothing ourselves, as the prisoners only stay with us a few hours.\" \"I\u0027ll be right back,\" said Fosdick. Not far from the station-house, Fosdick found a baker\u0027s shop, where he bought some bread and cakes, with which he started to return. As he was nearing the station-house, he caught sight of Micky Maguire hovering about the door. Micky smiled significantly as he saw Fosdick and his burden. \"Where are you carryin\u0027 that?\" he asked. \"Why do you ask?\" said Fosdick, who could not feel very friendly to the author of Dick\u0027s misfortune. \"Never mind why,\" said Micky. \"I know well enough. It\u0027s for your friend Dick. How does he like his new lodgins\u0027?\" \"How do you like them? You\u0027ve been there often enough.\" \"Don\u0027t be impudent, or I\u0027ll lam\u0027 ye,\" said Micky, scowling. As Fosdick was considerably smaller than himself, Micky might have ventured upon an assault, but deemed it imprudent in the immediate vicinity of the station-house. \"Give my compliments to Dick,\" he said. \"I hope he\u0027ll sleep well.\" To this Fosdick returned no answer, but, entering the building, descended to Dick\u0027s temporary quarters. He passed the bread and cake through the grating, and Dick, cheered by the hope of an acquittal on the morrow, and a speedy recovery of his freedom, partook with a good appetite. \"Can\u0027t you give me a mouthful, boss?\" muttered the negro woman before mentioned, as she caught sight of Fosdick\u0027s load. He passed a cake through the grating, which she seized eagerly, and devoured with appetite. \"I think I must be going,\" said Mr. Murdock, consulting his watch, \"or my wife and children won\u0027t know what has become of me.\" \"Good-night, Mr. Murdock,\" said Dick. \"Thank you for your kindness.\" \"Good-night, Richard. Keep up your courage.\" \"I\u0027ll try to.\" Fosdick stopped longer. At last he went away, and our hero, left to himself, lay down upon his pallet and tried to get to sleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2965/81616.html","bookId":383,"book":{"id":383,"title":"Fame and Fortune or, The Progress of Richard Hunter","description":"简介： Fame and Fortune, like its predecessor, Ragged Dick, was contributed as a serial story to the Schoolmate, a popular juvenile magazine published in Boston.
