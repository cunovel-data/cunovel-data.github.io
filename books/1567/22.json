{"id":109824,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Harry fell, panting, onto grass and scrambled up at once. They seemed to have landed in the corner of a field at dusk; Hermione was already running in a circle around them, waving her wand.\\n\\n \"Protego Totalum...Salvio Hexia...\"\\n\\n \"That treacherous old bleeder.\" Ron panted, emerging from beneath the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it to Harry. \"Hermione you\u0027re a genius, a total genius. I can\u0027t believe we got out of that.\"\\n\\n \"Cave Inimicum...Didn\u0027t I say it was a Frumpent horn, didn\u0027t I tell him? And now his house has been blown apart!\"\\n\\n \"Serves him right,\" said Ron, examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his legs, \"What\u0027d you reckon they\u0027ll do to him?\"\\n\\n \"Oh I hope they don\u0027t kill him!\" groaned Hermione, \"That\u0027s why I wanted the Death Eaters to get a glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn\u0027t been lying!\"\\n\\n \"Why hide me though?\" asked Ron.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re supposed to be in bed with spattergrolt, Ron! They\u0027ve kidnapped Luna because her father supported Harry! What would happen to your family if they knew you\u0027re with him?\"\\n\\n \"But what about your mum and dad?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re in Australia,\" said Hermione, \"They should be all right. They don\u0027t know anything.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a genius,\" Ron repeated, looking awed.\\n\\n \"Yeah, you are, Hermione,\" agreed Harry fervently. \"I don\u0027t know what we\u0027d do without you.\"\\n\\n She beamed, but became solemn at once.\\n\\n \"What about Luna?\"\\n\\n \"Well, if they\u0027re telling the truth and she\u0027s still alive ¨C\" began Ron.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t say that, don\u0027t say it!\" squealed Hermione. \"She must be alive, she must!\"\\n\\n \"Then she\u0027ll be in Azkaban, I expect,\" said Ron. \"Whether she survives the place, though...Loads don\u0027t...\"\\n\\n \"She will,\" said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the alternative. \"She\u0027s tough, Luna, much tougher than you\u0027d think. She\u0027s probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and Nargles.\"\\n\\n \"I hope you\u0027re right,\" said Hermione. She passed a hand over her eyes. \"I\u0027d feel so sorry for Xenophilius if ¨C\"\\n\\n \"¨C if he hadn\u0027t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah,\" said Ron.\\n\\n They put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made them tea. After their narrow escape, the chilly, musty old place felt like home: safe, familiar, and friendly.\\n\\n \"Oh, why did we go there?\" groaned Hermione after a few minutes\u0027 silence. \"Harry, you were right, it was Godric\u0027s Hollow all over again, a complete waste of time! The Deathly Hallows...such rubbish...although actually,\" a sudden thought seemed to have struck her, \"he might have made it all up, mightn\u0027t he? He probably doesn\u0027t believe in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived!\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think so,\" said Ron. \"It\u0027s a damn sight harder making stuff up when you\u0027re under stress than you\u0027d think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending to be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole new person. Old Lovegood was under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I don\u0027t suppose it matters,\" sighed Hermione. \"Even if he was being honest, I never heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life.\"\\n\\n \"Hang on, though,\" said Ron. \"The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a myth, wasn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"But the Deathly Hallows can\u0027t exist, Ron!\"\\n\\n \"You keep saying that, but one of them can,\" said Ron. \"Harry\u0027s Invisibility Cloak ¨C\"\\n\\n \"The Tale of the Three Brothers\u0027 is a story,\" said Hermione firmly. \"A story about how humans are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we\u0027d have everything we need already!\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand,\" said Harry, turning the blackthorn wand he so disliked over in his fingers.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no such thing, Harry!\"\\n\\n \"You said there have been loads of wands ¨C the Deathstick and whatever they were called ¨C\"\\n\\n \"All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand\u0027s real, what about the Resurrection Stone?\" Her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name, and her tone dripped sarcasm. \"No magic can raise the dead, and that\u0027s that!\"\\n\\n \"When my wand connected with You-Know-Who\u0027s, it made my mum and dad appear...and Cedric...\"\\n\\n \"But they weren\u0027t really back from the dead, were they?\" said Hermione. \"Those kind of ¨Cof pale imitations aren\u0027t the same as truly bringing someone back to life.\"\\n\\n \"But she, the girl in the tale, didn\u0027t really come back, did she? The story says that once people are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her, didn\u0027t he? He even lived with her for a while...\"\\n\\n He saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermione\u0027s expression. Then, as she glanced at Ron, Harry realized that it was fear: He had scared her with his talk of living with dead people.\\n\\n \"So that Peverell bloke who\u0027s buried in Godric\u0027s Hollow,\" he said hastily, trying to sound robustly sane, \"you don\u0027t know anything about him, then?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. \"I looked him up after I saw the mark on his grave; if he\u0027d been anyone famous or done anything important, I\u0027m sure he\u0027d be in one of our books. The only place I\u0027ve managed to find the name \u0027Peverell\u0027 Is Nature\u0027s Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from Kreacher,\" she explained as Ron raised his eyebrows. \"It lists the pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were one of the earliest families to vanish.\"\\n\\n \"Extinct in the male line?\" repeated Ron.\\n\\n \"It means the name died out,\" said Hermione, \"centuries ago, in the case of the Peverells. They could still have descendents, though, they\u0027d just be called something different.\"\\n\\n And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had stirred at the sound of the name \"Peverell\": a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry official, and he cried aloud, \"Marvolo Gaunt!\"\\n\\n \"Sorry\" said Ron and Hermione together.\\n\\n \"Marvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Who\u0027s grandfather! In the Pensieve! With Dumbledore! Marvolo Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!\"\\n\\n Ron and Hermione looked bewildered.\\n\\n \"The ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo Gaunt said it had the Peverell coat of arms on it! I saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministry\u0027s face, he nearly shoved it up his nose!\"\\n\\n \"The Peverell coat of arms?\" said Hermione sharply. \"Could you see what it looked like?\"\\n\\n \"Not really,\" said Harry, trying to remember. \"There was nothing fancy on there, as far as I could see; maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked open.\"\\n\\n Harry saw Hermione\u0027s comprehension in the sudden widening of her eyes. Ron was looking from one to the other, astonished.\\n\\n \"Blimey...You reckon it was this sign again? The sign of the Hallows?\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\" said Harry excitedly, \"Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig, all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he might not have known what it really was. There were no books in that house, and trust me, he wasn\u0027t the type to read fairy tales to his kids. He\u0027d have loved to think the scratches on the stone were a coat of arms, because as far as he was concerned, having pure blood made you practically royal.\"\\n\\n \"Yes...and that\u0027s all very interesting,\" said Hermione cautiously, \"but Harry, if you\u0027re thinking what I think you\u0027re think ¨C\"\\n\\n \"Well, why not? Why not?\" said Harry, abandoning caution. \"It was a stone, wasn\u0027t it?\" He looked at Ron for support. \"What if it was the Resurrection Stone?\"\\n\\n Ron\u0027s mouth fell open.\\n\\n \"Blimey ¨C but would it still work if Dumbledore broke ¨C?\"\\n\\n \"Work? Work? Ron, it never worked! There\u0027s no such thing as a Resurrection Stone!\"\\n\\n Hermione leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry. \"Harry you\u0027re trying to fit everything into the Hallows story ¨C\"\\n\\n \"Fit everything in?\" he repeated. \"Hermione, it fits of its own accord! I know the sign of the Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!\"\\n\\n \"A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027d you reckon the ring is now?\" Ron asked Harry. \"What did Dumbledore do with it after he broke it open?\"\\n\\n But Harry\u0027s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and Hermione\u0027s...\\n\\n Three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death...Master...Conqueror...Vanquisher...The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death...\\n\\n And he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Voldemort, whose Horcruxes were no match...Neither can live while the other survives...Was this the answer? Hallows versus Horcruxes? Was there a way after all, to ensure that he was the one who triumphed? If he were the master of the Deathly Hallows, would he be safe?\\n\\n \"Harry?\"\\n\\n But he scarcely heard Hermione: He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was running it through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. He had never seen anything to equal it in his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was exactly what Xenophilius had described: A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it...\\n\\n And then, with a gasp, he remembered ¨C\\n\\n \"Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!\"\\n\\n His voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not care.\\n\\n \"My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! He wanted to examine it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric\u0027s Hollow...\" Harry was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as though great new vistas of truth were opening all around him. \"He\u0027s my ancestor. I\u0027m descended from the third brother! It all makes sense!\"\\n\\n \"He felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea of possessing them was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to the other two.\"\\n\\n \"Harry,\" said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the pouch around his neck, his fingers shaking hard.\\n\\n \"Read it,\" he told her, pushing his mother\u0027s letter into her hand. \"Read it! Dumbledore had the Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn\u0027t need a Cloak, he could perform a Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one!\"\\n\\n Something fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair: He had dislodged the Snitch when he pulled out the letter. He stooped to pick it up, and then the newly tapped spring of fabulous discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder erupted inside him so that he shouted out.\\n\\n \"IT\u0027S IN HERE! He left me the ring ¨C it\u0027s in the Snitch!\"\\n\\n \"You ¨C you reckon?\"\\n\\n He could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was so obvious, so clear to Harry. Everything fit, everything...His Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he discovered how to open the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to do was find the first Hallow, the Elder Wand, and then ¨C\\n\\n But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage: All his excitement, all his hope and happiness were extinguished at a stroke, and he stood alone in the darkness, and the glorious spell was broken.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what he\u0027s after.\"\\n\\n The change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more scared.\\n\\n \"You-Know-Who\u0027s after the Elder Wand.\"\\n\\n He turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew it was the truth. It all made sense, Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was seeking an old wand, a very old wand indeed. Harry walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about Ron and Hermione as he looked out into the night, thinking...\\n\\n Voldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody could have told him The Tales of Beedle the Bard when he was a child, any more than Harry had heard them. Hardly any wizards believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew about them?\\n\\n Harry gazed into the darkness...If Voldemort had known about the Deathly Hallows, surely he would have sought them, done anything to possess them: three objects that made the possessor master of Death? If he had known about the Deathly Hallows, he might not have needed Horcruxes in the first place. Didn\u0027t the simple fact that he had taken a Hallow, and turned it into a Horcrux, demonstrate that he did not know this last great Wizarding secret?\\n\\n Which meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realizing its full power, without understanding that it was one of three...for the wand was the Hallow that could not be hidden, whose existence was best known...The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the pages of Wizarding history...\\n\\n Harry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver sliding over the face of the white moon. He felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries.\\n\\n He turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione standing exactly where he had left them, Hermione still holding Lily\u0027s letter, Ron at her side looking slightly anxious. Didn\u0027t they realize how far they had traveled in the last few minutes?\\n\\n \"This is it?\" Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own astonished certainty, \"This explains everything. The Deathly Hallows are real and I\u0027ve got one ¨C maybe two ¨C\"\\n\\n He held up the Snitch.\\n\\n \"¨C and You-Know-Who\u0027s chasing the third, but he doesn\u0027t realize...he just thinks it\u0027s a powerful wand ¨C\"\\n\\n \"Harry,\" said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him back Lily\u0027s letter, \"I\u0027m sorry, but I think you\u0027ve got this wrong, all wrong.\"\\n\\n \"But don\u0027t you see? It all fits ¨C\"\\n\\n \"Not, it doesn\u0027t,\" she said. \"It doesn\u0027t. Harry, you\u0027re just getting carried away. Please,\" she said as she started to speak, \"please just answer me this: If the Deathly Hallows really existed, and Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who possessed all of them would be master of Death ¨C Harry, why wouldn\u0027t he have told you? Why?\"\\n\\n He had his answer ready.\\n\\n \"But you said it, Hermione! You\u0027ve got to find out about them for yourself! It\u0027s a Quest!\"\\n\\n \"But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods\u0027!\" cried Hermione in exasperation. \"I didn\u0027t really believe it!\"\\n\\n Harry took no notice.\\n\\n \"Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me try my strength, take risks. This feels like the kind of thing he\u0027d do.\"\\n\\n \"Harry, this isn\u0027t a game, this isn\u0027t practice! This is the real thing, and Dumbledore left you very clear instructions: Find and destroy the Horcruxes! That symbol doesn\u0027t mean anything, forget the Deathly Hallows, we can\u0027t afford to get sidetracked ¨C\"\\n\\n Harry was barely listening to her. He was turning the Snitch over and over in his hands, half expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to Hermione that he was right, that the Deathly Hallows were real.\\n\\n She appealed to Ron.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t believe in this, do you?\"\\n\\n Harry looked up, Ron hesitated.\\n\\n \"I dunno...I mean...bits of it sort of fit together,\" said Ron awkwardly, \"But when you look at the whole thing...\" He took a deep breath. \"I think we\u0027re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes, Harry. That\u0027s what Dumbledore told us to do. Maybe...maybe we should forget about this Hallows business.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you, Ron,\" said Hermione. \"I\u0027ll take first watch.\"\\n\\n And she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance bringing the action to a fierce full stop.\\n\\n But Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the Deathly Hallows had taken possession of him, and he could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through his mind: the wand, the stone, and the Cloak, if he could just possess them all...\\n\\n I open at the close...But what was the close? Why couldn\u0027t he have the stone now? If only he had the stone, he could ask Dumbledore these questions in person...and Harry murmured words to the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even Parseltongue, but the golden ball would not open...\\n\\n And the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that hidden? Where was Voldemort searching now? Harry wished his scar would burn and show him Voldemort\u0027s thoughts, because for the first time ever, he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very same thing...Hermione would not like that idea, of course...But then, she did not believe....Xenophilius had been right, in a way...Limited, Narrow, Close-minded. The truth was that she was scared of the idea of the Deathly Hallows, especially of the Resurrection Stone...and Harry pressed his mouth again to the Snitch, kissing it, nearly swallowing it, but the cold medal did not yield...\\n\\n It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in Azkaban, surrounded by dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself. He had forgotten all about her in his feverish contemplation of the Hallows. If only they could rescue her, but dementors in those numbers would be virtually unassailable. Now he came to think about it, he had not tried casting a Patronus with the blackthorn wand...He must try that in the morning...\\n\\n If only there was a way of getting a better wand...\\n\\n And desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, unbeatable, invincible, swallowed him once more...\\n\\n They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of rain. The downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the tent that night, and persisted through the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and depressing. He could think only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing, not Hermione\u0027s flat disbelief nor Ron\u0027s persistent doubts, could extinguish. And yet the fiercer the longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the less joyful it made him. He blamed Ron and Hermione: Their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his spirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which remained absolute. Harry\u0027s belief in and longing for the Hallows consumed him so much that he felt isolated from the other two and their obsession with the Horcruxes.\\n\\n \"Obsession?\" said Hermione in a low fierce voice, when Harry was careless enough to use the word one evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more Horcruxes. \"We\u0027re not the one with an obsession, Harry! We\u0027re the ones trying to do what Dumbledore wanted us to do!\"\\n\\n But he was impervious to the veiled criticism. Dumbledore had left the sign of the Hallows for Hermione to decipher, and he had also, Harry remained convinced of it, left the Resurrection Stone hidden in the golden Snitch. Neither can live while the other survives...master of Death...Why didn\u0027t Ron and Hermione understand?\\n\\n \"\u0027The last enemy shall be destroyed is death,\u0027\" Harry quoted calmly.\\n\\n \"I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fighting?\" Hermione retorted, and Harry gave up on her.\\n\\n Even the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted on discussing, seemed less important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting sideshow. The only other thing that mattered to him was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he did all he could to hide this fact from the other two. He sought solitude whenever it happened, but was disappointed by what he saw. The visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in quality; they had become blurred, shifting as though they were moving in and out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct features of an object that looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow than substance. Used to images sharp as reality, Harry was disconcerted by the change. He was worried that the connection between himself and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that he both feared and, whatever he had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry connected these unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of his wand, as if it was the blackthorn wand\u0027s fault that he could no longer see into Voldemort\u0027s mind as well as before.\\n\\n As the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but notice, even through his new self-absorption, that Ron seemed to be taking charge. Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having walked out on them, perhaps because Harry\u0027s descent into listlessness galvanized his dormant leadership qualities, Ron was the one now encouraging and exhorting the other two into action.\\n\\n \"Three Horcruxes left,\" he kept saying. \"We need a plan of action, come on! Where haven\u0027t we looked? Let\u0027s go through it again. The orphanage...\"\\n\\n Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes, Albania, every place that they knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered, Ron and Hermione raked over them again, Harry joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him. He would have been happy to sit alone in silence, trying to read Voldemort\u0027s thoughts, to find out more about the Elder Wand, but Ron insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply, Harry was aware, to keep them moving.\\n\\n \"You never know,\" was Ron\u0027s constant refrain. \"Upper Flagley is a Wizarding village, he might\u0027ve wanted to live there. Let\u0027s go and have a poke around.\"\\n\\n These frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought them within occasional sight of Snatchers.\\n\\n \"Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters,\" said Ron. \"The lot that got me were a bit pathetic, but Bill recons some of them are really dangerous. They said on Potterwatch ¨C\"\\n\\n \"On what?\" said Harry.\\n\\n \"Potterwatch, didn\u0027t I tell you that\u0027s what it was called? The program I keep trying to get on the radio, the only one that tells the truth about what\u0027s going on! Nearly all of the programs are following You-Know-Who\u0027s line, all except Potterwatch, I really want you to hear it, but it\u0027s tricky tuning in...\"\\n\\n Ron spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out various rhythms on top of the wireless while the dials whirled. Occasionally they would catch snatches of advice on how to treat dragonpox, and once a few bars of \"A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love.\" While he taped, Ron continued to try to hit on the correct password, muttering strings of random words under his breath.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re normally something to do with the Order,\" he told them. \"Bill had a real knack for guessing them. I\u0027m bound to get one in the end...\"\\n\\n But not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry was sitting in the tent entrance, on guard duty, staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly ground, when Ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent. \"I\u0027ve got it, I\u0027ve got it! Password was \u0027Albus\u0027! Get in here, Harry.\"\\n\\n Roused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the Deathly Hallows, Harry hurried back inside the tent to find Ron and Hermione kneeling on the floor beside the little radio. Hermione, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for something to do, was sitting open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker, from which a most familiar voice was issuing.\\n\\n \"...apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves, which was due to a number of house calls in our area by those charming Death Eaters.\"\\n\\n \"But that\u0027s Lee Jordan!\" said Hermione.\\n\\n \"I know!\" beamed Ron. \"Cool, eh?\"\\n\\n \"...now found ourselves another secure location,\" Lee was saying, \"and I\u0027m pleased to tell you that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening. Evening, boys!\"\\n\\n \"Hi.\"\\n\\n \"Evening, River.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027River\u0027 that\u0027s Lee,\" Ron explained. \"They\u0027ve all got code names, but you can usually tell ¨C\"\\n\\n \"Shh!\" said Hermione.\\n\\n \"But before we hear from Royal and Romulus,\" Lee went on, \"let\u0027s take a moment to report those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily Prophet don\u0027t think important enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks and Dirk Cresswell.\"\\n\\n Harry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione gazed at one another in horror.\\n\\n \"A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggle-born Dean Thomas and a second goblin, both believed to have been traveling with Tonks, Cresswell, and Gornuk, may have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents and sisters are desperate for news.\"\\n\\n \"Meanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their home. Muggle authorities are attributing their deaths to a gas leak, but members of the Order of the Phoenix inform me that it was the Killing Curse ¨C more evidence, as if it were needed, of the fact that Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational sport under the new regime.\"\\n\\n \"Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot have been discovered in Godric\u0027s Hollow. The evidence is that she died several months ago. The Order of the Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by Dark Magic.\"\\n\\n \"Listeners, I\u0027d like to invite you now to join us in a minute\u0027s silence in memory of Ted Tonks, Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the unnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles murdered by the Death Eaters.\"\\n\\n Silence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half of Harry yearned to hear more, half of him was afraid of what might come next. It was the first time he had felt fully connected to the outside world for a long time.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" said Lee\u0027s voice. \"And now we can return to regular contributor Royal, for an update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, River,\" said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured, reassuring.\\n\\n \"Kingsley!\" burst out Ron.\\n\\n \"We know!\" said Hermione, hushing him.\\n\\n \"Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to sustain heavy casualties,\" said Kingsley. \"However, we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and neighbors, often without the Muggles\u0027 knowledge. I\u0027d like to appeal to all our listeners to emulate their example, perhaps by casting a protective charm over any Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved if such simple measures are taken.\"\\n\\n \"And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times, it should be \u0027Wizards first\u0027? asked Lee.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d say that it\u0027s one short step from \u0027Wizards first\u0027 to \u0027Purebloods first,\u0027 and then to \u0027Death Eaters,\u0027\" replied Kingsley. \"We\u0027re all human, aren\u0027t we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.\"\\n\\n \"Excellently put, Royal, and you\u0027ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if we ever get out of this mess,\" said Lee. \"And now, over to Romulus for our popular feature \u0027Pals of Potter.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, River,\" said another very familiar voice. Ron started to speak, but Hermione forestalled him in a whisper.\\n\\n \"We know it\u0027s Lupin!\"\\n\\n \"Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you\u0027ve appeared on our program, that Harry Potter is still alive?\"\\n\\n \"I do,\" said Lupin firmly. \"There is no doubt at all in my mind that his death would be proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened, because it would strike a deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. \u0027The Boy Who Lived\u0027 remains a symbol of everything for which we are fighting: the triumph of good, the power of innocence, the need to keep resisting.\"\\n\\n A mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had Lupin forgiven him, then, for the terrible things he had said when they had last met?\\n\\n \"And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening, Romulus?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d tell him we\u0027re all with him in spirit,\" said Lupin, then hesitated slightly, \"And I\u0027d tell him to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly always right.\"\\n\\n Harry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears.\\n\\n \"Nearly always right,\" she repeated.\\n\\n \"Oh, didn\u0027t I tell you?\" said Ron in surprise. \"Bill told me Lupin\u0027s living with Tonks again! And apparently she\u0027s getting pretty big too...\"\\n\\n \"...and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter\u0027s who are suffering for their allegiance?\" Lee was saying.\\n\\n \"Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of Harry Potter have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile editor of The Quibbler,\" said Lupin.\\n\\n \"At least he\u0027s still alive!\" muttered Ron.\\n\\n \"We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid\" ¨C all three of them gasped, and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence ¨C \"well-known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a \u0027Support Harry Potter\u0027 party in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody, and is, we believe, on the run.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you\u0027ve got a sixteen-foot-high half brother?\" asked Lee.\\n\\n \"It would tend to give you an edge,\" agreed Lupin gravely. \"May I just add that while we here at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid\u0027s spirit, we would urge even the most devoted of Harry\u0027s supporters against following Hagrid\u0027s lead. \u0027Support Harry Potter\u0027 parties are unwise in the present climate.\"\\n\\n \"Indeed they are, Romulus,\" said Lee, \"so we suggest that you continue to show your devotion to the man with the lightning scar by listening to Potterwatch! And now let\u0027s move to news concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. We like to refer to him as the Chief Death Eater, and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about him, I\u0027d like to introduce a new correspondent. Rodent?\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Rodent\u0027?\" said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione cried out together:\\n\\n \"Fred!\"\\n\\n \"No ¨C is it George?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Fred, I think,\" said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was said, \"I\u0027m not being \u0027Rodent,\u0027 no way, I told you I wanted to be \u0027Rapier\u0027!\"\\n\\n \"Oh, all right then, \u0027Rapier,\u0027 could you please give us your take on the various stories we\u0027ve been hearing about the Chief Death Eater?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, River, I can,\" said Fred. \"As our listeners will know, unless they\u0027ve taken refuge at the bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar, You-Know-Who\u0027s strategy of remaining in the shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the alleged sightings of him are genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-Know-Whos running around the place.\"\\n\\n \"Which suits him, of course,\" said Kingsley. \"The air of mystery is creating more terror than actually showing himself.\"\\n\\n \"Agreed,\" said Fred. \"So, people, let\u0027s try and calm down a bit. Things are bad enough without inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who can kill people with a single glance from his eyes. That\u0027s a basilisk, listeners. One simple test: Check whether the thing that\u0027s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it\u0027s safe to look into its eyes, although if it really is You-Know-Who, that\u0027s still likely to be the last thing you ever do.\"\\n\\n For the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing: He could feel the weight of tension leaving him.\\n\\n \"And the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?\" asked Lee.\\n\\n \"Well, who wouldn\u0027t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he\u0027s been putting in?\" asked Fred. \"Point is, people, don\u0027t get lulled into a false sense of security, thinking he\u0027s out of the country. Maybe he is, maybe he isn\u0027t, but the fact remains he can move faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don\u0027t count on him being a long way away if you\u0027re planning to take any risks. I never thought I\u0027d hear myself say it, but safety first!\"\\n\\n \"Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,\" said Lee. \"Listeners, that brings us to the end of another Potterwatch. We don\u0027t know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials: The next password will be \u0027Mad-Eye.\u0027 Keep each other safe: Keep faith. Good night.\"\\n\\n The radio\u0027s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; Harry had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that other people were resisting Voldemort. It was like waking from a long sleep.\\n\\n \"Good, eh?\" said Ron happily.\\n\\n \"Brilliant,\" said Harry.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s so brave of them,\" sighed Hermione admiringly. \"If they were found ...\"\\n\\n \"Well, they keep on the move, don\u0027t they?\" said Ron. \"Like us.\"\\n\\n \"But did you hear what Fred said?\" asked Harry excitedly; now the broadcast was over, his thoughts turned around toward his all consuming obsession. \"He\u0027s abroad! He\u0027s still looking for the Wand, I knew it!\"\\n\\n \"Harry ¨C \"\\n\\n \"Come on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol ¨C \"\\n\\n \"HARRY, NO!\"\\n\\n \" ¨C demort\u0027s after the Elder Wand!\"\\n\\n \"The name\u0027s Taboo!\" Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded outside the tent. \"I told you, Harry, I told you, we can\u0027t say it anymore ¨C we\u0027ve got to put the protection back around us ¨C quickly ¨C it\u0027s how they find ¨C \"\\n\\n But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the table had lit up and begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer: rough, excited voices. Ron pulled the Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it: Their lamps went out.\\n\\n \"Come out of there with your hands up!\" came a rasping voice through the darkness. \"We know you\u0027re in there! You\u0027ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and we don\u0027t care who we curse!\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-harry-potter-7/page-22.html","bookId":1567,"book":{"id":1567,"title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter #7)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \\n (Harry Potter #7) \\n Readers beware. The brilliant, breathtaking conclusion to J.K. Rowling\u0027s spellbinding series is not for the faint of heart--such revelations, battles, and betrayals await in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows that no fan will make it to the end unscathed. Luckily, Rowling has prepped loyal readers for the end of her series by doling out increasingly dark and dangerous tales of magic and mystery, shot through with lessons about honor and contempt, love and loss, and right and wrong. Fear not, you will find no spoilers in our review--to tell the plot would ruin the journey, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is an odyssey the likes of which Rowling\u0027s fans have not yet seen, and are not likely to forget. But we would be remiss if we did not offer one small suggestion before you embark on your final adventure with Harry--bring plenty of tissues. \\n The heart of Book 7 is a hero\u0027s mission--not just in Harry\u0027s quest for the Horcruxes, but in his journey from boy to man--and Harry faces more danger than that found in all six books combined, from the direct threat of the Death Eaters and you-know-who, to the subtle perils of losing faith in himself. Attentive readers would do well to remember Dumbledore\u0027s warning about making the choice between \"what is right and what is easy,\" and know that Rowling applies the same difficult principle to the conclusion of her series. While fans will find the answers to hotly speculated questions about Dumbledore, Snape, and you-know-who, it is a testament to Rowling\u0027s skill as a storyteller that even the most astute and careful reader will be taken by surprise. \\n A spectacular finish to a phenomenal series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a bittersweet read for fans. The journey is hard, filled with events both tragic and triumphant, the battlefield littered with the bodies of the dearest and despised, but the final chapter is as brilliant and blinding as a phoenix\u0027s flame, and fans and skeptics alike will emerge from the confines of the story with full but heavy hearts, giddy and grateful for the experience.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-harry-potter-7.jpg","author":"J.K.
