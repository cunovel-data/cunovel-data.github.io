{"id":109811,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Three o\u0027clock on the following afternoon found Harry, Ron, Fred and George standing outside the great white marquee in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the wedding guests. Harry had taken a large dose of Polyjuice Potion and was now the double of a redheaded Muggle boy from the local village, Ottery St. Catchpole, from whom Fred had stolen hairs using a Summoning Charm. The plan was to introduce Harry as \"Cousin Barny\" and trust to the great number of Weasley relatives to camouflage him.\\n\\n All four of them were clutching seating plans, so that they could help show people to the right seats. A host of white-robed waiters had arrived an hour earlier, along with a golden jacketed band, and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away under a tree. Harry could see a blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot. Behind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet. The supporting poles were entwined with white and gold flowers. Fred and George had fastened an enormous bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur would shortly become husband and wife. Outside, butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. Harry was rather uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting was slightly fatter than him and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summer\u0027s day.\\n\\n \"When I get married,\" said Fred, tugging at the collar of his own robes, \"I won\u0027t be bothering with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I\u0027ll put a full Body Bird Curse on Mum until it\u0027s all over.\"\\n\\n \"She wasn\u0027t too bad this morning, considering,\" said George. \"Cried a bit about Percy not being here, but who wants him. Oh blimey, brace yourselves, here they come, look.\"\\n\\n Brightly colored figures were appearing, one by one out of nowhere at the distant boundary of the yard. Within minutes a procession had formed, which began to snake its way up through the garden toward the marquee. Exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the witches\u0027 hats, while precious gems glittered from many of the wizards\u0027 cravats; a hum of excited chatter grew louder and louder, drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent.\\n\\n \"Excellent, I think I see a few veela cousins,\" said George, craning his neck for a better look. \"They\u0027ll need help understanding our English customs, I\u0027ll look after them....\"\\n\\n \"Not so fast, Your Holeyness,\" said Fred, and darting past the gaggle of middle-aged witches heading for the procession, he said, \"Here ¨C permetiez moi to assister vous,\" to a pair of pretty French girls, who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside. George was left to deal with the middle-aged witches and Ron took charge of Mr. Weasley\u0027s old Ministry-colleague Perkins, while a rather deaf old couple fell to Harry\u0027s lot.\\n\\n \"Wotcher,\" said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found Tonks and Lupin at the front of the queue. She had turned blonde for the occasion. \"Arthur told us you were the one with the curly hair. Sorry about last night,\" she added in a whisper as Harry led them up the aisle. \"The Ministry\u0027s being very anti-werewolf at the museum and we thought our presence might not do you any favors.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s fine, I understand,\" said Harry, speaking more to Lupin than Tonks. Lupin gave him a swift smile, but as they turned away Harry saw Lupin\u0027s face fall again into lines of misery. He did not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter. Hagrid was causing a certain amount of disruption. Having misunderstood Fred\u0027s directions as he had sat himself, not upon the magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row, but on five sets that now resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks.\\n\\n While Mr. Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid shouted apologies to anybody who would listen, Harry hurried back to the entrance to find Ron face-to-face with a most eccentric-looking wizard. Slightly cross-eyed, with shoulder-length white hair the texture of candyfloss, he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of his nose and robes of an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow. An odd symbol, rather like a triangular eye, glistened from a golden chain around his neck.\\n\\n \"Xenophilius Lovegood,\" he said, extending a hand to Harry, \"my daughter and I live just over the hill, so kind of the good Weasleys to invite us. But I think you know my Luna?\" he added to Ron.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Ron. \"Isn\u0027t she with you?\"\\n\\n \"She lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes, such a glorious infestation! How few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes ¨C or, to give them their correct name, the Gernumbli gardensi.\"\\n\\n \"Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words,\" said Ron, \"but I think Fred and George taught them those.\"\\n\\n He led a party of warlocks into the marquee as Luna rushed up.\\n\\n \"Hello, Harry!\" she said.\\n\\n \"Er ¨C my name\u0027s Barry,\" said Harry, flummoxed.\\n\\n \"Oh, have you changed that too?\" she asked brightly.\\n\\n \"How did you know -?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, just your expression,\" she said.\\n\\n Like her father, Luna was wearing bright yellow robes, which she had accessorized with a large sunflower in her hair. Once you get over the brightness of it all, the general effect was quite pleasant. At least there were no radishes dangling from her ears.\\n\\n Xenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance, had missed the exchange between Luna and Harry. Biding the wizard farewell, he turned to his daughter, who held up her finger and said, \"Daddy, look ¨C one of the gnomes actually bit me.\"\\n\\n \"How wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial.\" Said Mr. Lovegood, seizing Luna\u0027s outstretched fingers and examining the bleeding puncture marks. \"Luna, my love, if you should feel any burgeoning talent today ¨C perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaims in Mermish ¨C do not repress it! You may have been gifted by the Gernumblies!\"\\n\\n Ron, passing them in the opposite direction let out a loud snort.\\n\\n \"Ron can laugh,\" said Luna serenely as Harry led her and Xenophilius toward their seats, \"but my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" said Harry, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her father\u0027s peculiar views. \"Are you sure you don\u0027t want to put anything on that bite, though?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, it\u0027s fine,\" said Luna, sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking Harry up and down. \"You look smart. I told Daddy most people would probably wear dress robes, but he believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding, for luck, you know.\"\\n\\n As she drifted off after her father, Ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching his arm. Her beaky nose, red-rimmed eyes, and leathery pink hat gave her the look of a bad-tempered flamingo.\\n\\n \"...and your hair\u0027s much too long, Ronald, for a moment I thought you were Ginevra. Merlin\u0027s beard, what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing? He looks like an omelet. And who are you?\" she barked at Harry.\\n\\n \"Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.\"\\n\\n \"Another Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isn\u0027t Harry Potter here? I was hoping to meet him. I thought he was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have you merely been boasting?\"\\n\\n \"No ¨C he couldn\u0027t come ¨C \"\\n\\n \"Hmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks in press photographs, then. I\u0027ve just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara,\" she shouted at Harry. \"Goblin-made, you know, and been in my family for centuries. She\u0027s a good-looking girl, but still ¨C French. Well, well, find me a good seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too long.\"\\n\\n Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time. When next they met at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen more people to their places. The Marquee was nearly full now and for the first time there was no queue outside.\\n\\n \"Nightmare, Muriel is,\" said Ron, mopping his forehead on his sleeve. \"She used to come for Christmas every year, then, thank God, she took offense because Fred and George set off a Dungbomb under her chair at diner. Dad always says she\u0027ll have written them out of her will ¨C like they care, they\u0027re going to end up richer than anyone in the family, rate they\u0027re going... Wow,\" he added, blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came hurrying toward them. \"You look great!\"\\n\\n \"Always the tone of surprise,\" said Hermione, though she smiled. She was wearing a floaty, lilac-colored dress with matching high heels; her hair was sleek and shiny. \"Your Great-Aunt Muriel doesn\u0027t agree, I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara. She said, \u0027Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?\u0027 and then, \u0027Bad posture and skinny ankles.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t take it personally, she\u0027s rude to everyone,\" said Ron.\\n\\n \"Talking about Muriel?\" inquired George, reemerging from the marquee with Fred. \"Yeah, she\u0027s just told me my ears are lopsided. Old bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius was still with us, though; he was a right laugh at weddings.\"\\n\\n \"Wasn\u0027t he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty-four hours later?\" asked Hermione.\\n\\n \"Well, yeah, he went a bit odd toward the end,\" conceded George.\\n\\n \"But before he went loopy he was the life and soul of the party,\" said Fred. \"He used to down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run onto the dance floor, hoist up his robes, and start pulling bunches of flowers out of his ¨C \"\\n\\n \"Yes, he sounds a real charmer,\" said Hermione, while Harry roared with laughter.\\n\\n \"Never married, for some reason,\" said Ron.\\n\\n \"You amaze me,\" said Hermione.\\n\\n They were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer, a dark-haired young man with a large, curved nose and thick black eyebrows, until he held out his invitation to Ron and said, with his eyes on Hermione, \"You look vunderful.\"\\n\\n \"Viktor!\" she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded bag, which made a loud thump quite disproportionate to its size. As she scrambled, blushing, to pick it up, she said \"I didn\u0027t know you were ¨C goodness ¨C it\u0027s lovely to see ¨C how are you?\"\\n\\n Ron\u0027s ears had turned bright red again. After glancing at Krum\u0027s invitation as if he did not believe a word of it, he said, much too loudly, \"how come you\u0027re here?\"\\n\\n \"Fleur invited me,\" said Krum, eyebrows raised.\\n\\n Harry, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then feeling that it would be prudent to remove Krum from Ron\u0027s vicinity, offered to show him his seat.\\n\\n \"Your friend is not pleased to see me,\" said Krum, as they entered the now packed marquee. \"Or is he a relative?\" he added with a glance at Harry\u0027s red curly hair.\\n\\n \"Cousin.\" Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening. His appearance was causing a stir, particularly amongst the veela cousins: He was, after all, a famous Quidditch player. While people were still craning their necks to get a good look at him, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George came hurrying down the aisle.\\n\\n \"Time to sit down,\" Fred told Harry, \"or we\u0027re going to get run over by the bride.\"\\n\\n Harry, Ron and Hermione took their seats in the second row behind Fred and George. Hermione looked rather pink and Ron\u0027s ears were still scarlet. After a few moments he muttered to Harry, \"Did you see he\u0027s grown a stupid little beard?\"\\n\\n Harry gave a noncommittal grunt.\\n\\n A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the general murmuring broken by occasional spurts of excited laughter. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley strolled up the aisle, smiling and waving at relatives; Mrs. Weasley was wearing a brand-new set of amethyst colored robes with a matching hat.\\n\\n A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the marquee, both wearing dress robes, with larger white roses in their buttonholes; Fred wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of giggling from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to be the golden balloons.\\n\\n \"Ooooh!\" said Hermione, swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance.\\n\\n A great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as Monsieur Delacour and Fleur came walking up the aisle, Fleur gliding, Monsieur Delacour bouncing and beaming. Fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a strong, silvery glow. While her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison, today it beautified everybody it fell upon. Ginny and Gabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier than usual and once Fleur had reached for him, Bill did not look as though he had ever met Fenrit Greyback.\\n\\n \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said a slightly singsong voice, and with a slight shock, Harry saw the same small, tufty-hired wizard who had presided at Dumbledore\u0027s funeral, now standing in front of Bill and Fleur. \"We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls...\"\\n\\n \"Yes, my tiara set off the whole thing nicely,\" said Auntie Muriel in a rather carrying whisper. \"But I must say, Ginevra\u0027s dress is far too low cut.\"\\n\\n Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front again. Harry\u0027s mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to the afternoons spent alone with Ginny in lonely parts of the school grounds. They seemed so long ago; they had always seemed too good to be true, as though he had been stealing shining hours from a normal person\u0027s life, a person without a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead....\\n\\n \"Do you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle...?\"\\n\\n In the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobbing quietly into scraps of lace. Trumpetlike sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that Hagrid had taken out one of his own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned around and beamed at Harry; her eyes too were full of tears.\\n\\n \"...then I declare you bonded for life.\"\\n\\n The tufty-haired wizard waved his hand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and a shower of silver stars fell upon them, spiraling around their now entwined figures. As Fred and George led a round of applause, the golden balloons overhead burst. Birds of paradise and tiny golden bells flew and floated out of them, adding their songs and chimes to the din.\\n\\n \"Ladies and gentlemen!\" called the tufty-haired wizard. \"If you would please stand up!\"\\n\\n They all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he waved his wand again. The scars on which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee vanished, so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with a glorious view of the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside. Next, a pool of molten gold spread from the center of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor; the hovering chairs grouped themselves around small, white-clothed tables, which all floated gracefully back to earth round it, and the golden-jacketed hand trooped toward a podium.\\n\\n \"Smooth,\" said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides, some hearing silver trays of pumpkin juice, butterbeer, and firewhisky, others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches.\\n\\n \"We should go and congratulate them!\" said Hermione, standing on tiptoe to see the place where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well-wishers.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll have time later,\" shrugged Ron, snatching three butterbeers from a passing tray and handing one to Harry. \"Hermione, cop hold, let\u0027s grab a table.... Not there! Nowhere near Muriel ¨C \"\\n\\n Ron led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and right as he went; Harry felt sure that he was keeping an eye out for Krum. By the time they had reached the other side of the marquee, most of the tables were occupied: The emptiest was the one where Luna sat alone.\\n\\n \"All right if we join you?\" asked Ron.\\n\\n \"Oh yes,\" she said happily. \"Daddy\u0027s just gone to give Bill and Fleur our present.\"\\n\\n \"What is it, a lifetime\u0027s supply of Gurdyroots?\" asked Ron.\\n\\n Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry instead. Eyes watering in pain, Harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments.\\n\\n The band had begun to play, Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first, to great applause; after a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Delacour onto the floor, followed by Mr. Weasley and Fleur\u0027s father.\\n\\n \"I like this song,\" said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike tune, and a few seconds later she stood up and glided onto the dance floor, where she revolved on the spot, quite alone, eyes closed and waving her arms.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s great isn\u0027t she?\" said Ron admiringly. \"Always good value.\"\\n\\n But the smile vanished from his face at once: Viktor Krum had dropped into Luna\u0027s vacant seat. Hermione looked pleasurably flustered but this time Krum had not come to compliment her. With a scowl on his face he said, \"Who is that man in the yellow?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s Xenophilius Lovegood, he\u0027s the father of a friend of ours,\" said Ron. His pugnacious tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the clear provocation. \"Come and dance,\" he added abruptly to Hermione.\\n\\n She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They vanished together into the growing throng on the dance floor.\\n\\n \"Ah, they are together now?\" asked Krum, momentarily distracted.\\n\\n \"Er ¨C sort of,\" said Harry.\\n\\n \"Who are you?\" Krum asked.\\n\\n \"Barny Weasley.\"\\n\\n They shook hands.\\n\\n \"You, Barny ¨C you know this man Lovegood well?\"\\n\\n \"No, I only met him today. Why?\"\\n\\n Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophilius, who was chatting to several warlocks on the other side of the dance floor.\\n\\n \"Because,\" said Krum, \"If he vus not a guest of Fleur\u0027s I vould dud him, here and now, for veering that filthy sign upon his chest.\"\\n\\n \"Sign?\" said Harry, looking over at Xenophilius too. The strange triangular eye was gleaming on his chest. \"Why? What\u0027s wrong with it?\"\\n\\n \"Grindelvald. That is Grindelvald\u0027s sign.\"\\n\\n \"Grindelwald... the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated?\"\\n\\n \"Exactly.\"\\n\\n Krum\u0027s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he said, \"Grindelvald killed many people, my grandfather, for instance. Of course, he vos never powerful in this country, they said he feared Dumbledore ¨C and rightly, seeing how he vos finished. But this\" ¨C he pointed a finger at Xenophilius ¨C \"this is his symbol, I recognized it at vunce: Grindelvald carved it into a vall at Durmstrang ver he vos a pupil there. Some idiots copied it onto their books and clothes thinking to shock, make themselves impressive ¨C until those of us who had lost family members to Grindelvald taught them better.\"\\n\\n Krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophilius. Harry felt perplexed. It seemed incredibly unlikely that Luna\u0027s father was a supporter of the Dark Arts, and nobody else in the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular, finlike shape.\\n\\n \"Are you ¨C er ¨C quite sure it\u0027s Grindelwald\u0027s -?\"\\n\\n \"I am not mistaken,\" said Krum coldly. \"I walked past that sign for several years, I know it vell.\"\\n\\n \"Well, there\u0027s a chance,\" said Harry, \"that Xenophilius doesn\u0027t actually know what the symbol means, the Lovegoods are quite... unusual. He could have easily picked it up somewhere and think it\u0027s a cross section of the head of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or something.\"\\n\\n \"The cross section of a vot?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I don\u0027t know what they are, but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for them....\"\\n\\n Harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining Luna and her father.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s her,\" he said, pointing at Luna, who was still dancing alone, waving her arms around her head like someone attempting to beat off midges.\\n\\n \"Vy is she doing that?\" asked Krum.\\n\\n \"Probably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt,\" said Harry, who recognized the symptoms.\\n\\n Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making fun of him. He drew his hand from inside his robe and tapped it menacingly on his thighs; sparks flew out of the end.\\n\\n \"Gregorovitch!\" said Harry loudly, and Krum started, but Harry was too excited to care; the memory had come back to him at the sight of Krum\u0027s wand: Ollivander taking it and examining it carefully before the Triwizard Tournament.\\n\\n \"Vot about him?\" asked Krum suspiciously.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a wandmaker!\"\\n\\n \"I know that,\" said Krum.\\n\\n \"He made your wand! That\u0027s why I thought ¨C Quidditch ¨C \"\\n\\n Krum was looking more and more suspicious.\\n\\n \"How do you know Gregorovitch made my wand?\"\\n\\n \"I...I read it somewhere, I think,\" said Harry. \"In a ¨C a fan magazine,\" he improvised wildly and Krum looked mollified.\\n\\n \"I had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans,\" he said.\\n\\n \"So... er... where is Gregorowitch these days?\"\\n\\n Krum looked puzzled.\\n\\n \"He retired several years ago. I was one of the last to purchase a Gregorovitch vand. They are the best ¨Calthough I know, of course, that your Britons set much store by Ollivander.\"\\n\\n Harry did not answer. He pretended to watch the dancers, like Krum, but he was thinking hard. So Voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker and Harry did not have to search far for a reason. It was surely because of what Harry\u0027 wand had done on the night that Voldemort pursued him across the skies. The holly and phoenix feather wand had conquered the borrowed wand, some thing that Ollivander had not anticipated or understood. Would Gregorowitch know better? Was he truly more skilled than Ollivander, did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not?\\n\\n \"This girl is very nice-looking,\" Krum said, recalling Harry to his surroundings. Krum was pointing at Ginny, who had just joined Luna. \"She is also a relative of yours?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" said Harry, suddenly irritated, \"and she\u0027s seeing someone. Jealous type. Big bloke. You wouldn\u0027t want to cross him.\"\\n\\n Krum grunted.\\n\\n \"Vot,\" he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again, \"is the point of being an international Quidditch player if all the good-looking girls are taken?\"\\n\\n And he strode off leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way around the edge of the crowded dance floor. He wanted to find Ron, to tell him about Gregorovitch, but he was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the floor. Harry leaned up against one of the golden pillars and watched Ginny, who was now dancing with Fred and George\u0027s friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given Ron.\\n\\n He had never been to a wedding before, so he could not judge how Wizarding celebrations differed from Muggle ones, though he was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake was cut, or bottles of champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd. As the evening drew in, and moths began to swoop under the canopy, now lit with floating golden lanterns, the revelry became more and more uncontained. Fred and George had long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of Fleur\u0027s cousins; Charlie, Hagrid, and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing \"Odo the Hero\" in the corner.\\n\\n Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Ron\u0027s who seemed unsure whether or not Harry was his son, Harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table. His cloud of white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock and was topped by a moth-eaten fez. He was vaguely familiar: Racking his brains, Harry suddenly realized that this was Elphias Doge, member of the Order of the Phoenix and the writer of Dumbledore\u0027s obituary.\\n\\n Harry approached him.\\n\\n \"May I sit down?\"\\n\\n \"Of course, of course,\" said Doge; he had a rather high-pitched, wheezy voice.\\n\\n Harry leaned in.\\n\\n \"Mr. Doge, I\u0027m Harry Potter.\"\\n\\n Doge gasped.\\n\\n \"My dear boy! Arthur told me you were here, disguised.... I am so glad, so honored!\"\\n\\n In a flutter of nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a goblet of champagne.\\n\\n \"I thought of writing to you,\" he whispered, \"after Dumbledore... the shock... and for you, I am sure...\"\\n\\n Doge\u0027s tiny eyes filled with sudden tears.\\n\\n \"I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet,\" said Harry. \"I didn\u0027t realize you knew Professor Dumbledore so well.\"\\n\\n \"As well as anyone,\" said Doge, dabbing his eyes with a napkin. \"Certainly I knew him longest, if you don\u0027t count Aberforth ¨C and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.\"\\n\\n \"Speaking of the Daily Prophet... I don\u0027t know whether you saw, Mr. Doge -?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, please call me Elphias, dear boy.\"\\n\\n \"Elphias, I don\u0027t know whether you saw the interview Rita Skeeter gave about Dumbledore?\"\\n\\n Doge\u0027s face flooded with angry color.\\n\\n \"Oh yes, Harry, I saw it. That woman, or vulture might be a more accurate term, positively pestered me to talk to her, I am ashamed to say that I became rather rude, called her an interfering trout, which resulted, as you my have seen, in aspersions cast upon my sanity.\"\\n\\n \"Well, in that interview,\" Harry went on, \"Rita Skeeter hinted that Professor Dumbledore was involved in the Dark Arts when he was young.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t believe a word of it!\" said Doge at once. \"Not a word, Harry! Let nothing tarnish your memories of Albus Dumbledore!\"\\n\\n Harry looked into Doge\u0027s earnest, pained face, and felt, not reassured, but frustrated. Did Doge really think it was that easy, that Harry could simply choose not to believe? Didn\u0027t Doge understand Harry\u0027s need to be sure, to know everything?\\n\\n Perhaps Doge suspected Harry\u0027s feelings, for he looked concerned and hurried on, \"Harry, Rita Skeeter is a dreadful ¨C \"\\n\\n But he was interrupted by a shrill cackle.\\n\\n \"Rita Skeeter? Oh, I love her, always read her!\"\\n\\n Harry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there, the plumes dancing on her hair, a goblet of champagne in her hand. \"She\u0027s written a book about Dumbledore, you know!\"\\n\\n \"Hello, Muriel,\" said Doge, \"Yes, we were just discussing ¨C \"\\n\\n \"You there! Give me your chair, I\u0027m a hundred and seven!\"\\n\\n Another redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off his seat, looking alarmed, and Auntie Muriel swung it around with surprising strength and plopped herself down upon it between Doge and Harry.\\n\\n \"Hello again, Barry or whatever your name is,\" she said to Harry, \"Now what were you saying about Rita Skeeter, Elphias? You know, she\u0027s written a biography of Dumbledore? I can\u0027t wait to read it. I must remember to place an order at Flourish and Blotts!\"\\n\\n Doge looked stiff and solemn at this but Auntie Muriel drained her goblet and clicked her bony fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement. She took another large gulp of champagne, belched and then said, \"There\u0027s no need to look like a pair of stuffed frogs! Before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh, there were some mighty funny rumors about Albus!\"\\n\\n \"Ill-informed sniping,\" said Doge, turning radish-colored again.\\n\\n \"You would say that, Elphias,\" cackled Auntie Muriel. \"I noticed how you skated over the sticky patches in that obituary of yours!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry you think so,\" said Doge, more coldly still. \"I assure you I was writing from the heart.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I daresay you\u0027ll still think he was a saint even if it does turn out that he did away with his Squib sister!\"\\n\\n \"Muriel!\" exclaimed Doge.\\n\\n A chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through Harry\u0027s chest.\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" he asked Muriel. \"Who said his sister was a Squib? I thought she was ill?\"\\n\\n \"Thought wrong, then, didn\u0027t you, Barry!\" said Auntie Muriel, looking delighted at the effect she had produced. \"Anyway, how could you expect to know anything about it! It all happened years and years before you were even thought of, my dear, and the truth is that those of us who were alive then never knew what really happened. That\u0027s why I can\u0027t wait to find out what Skeeter\u0027s unearthed! Dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time!\"\\n\\n \"Untrue!\" wheezed Doge, \"Absolutely untrue!\"\\n\\n \"He never told me his sister as a Squib,\" said Harry, without thinking, still cold inside.\\n\\n \"And why on earth would he tell you?\" screeched Muriel, swaying a little in her seat as she attempted to focus upon Harry.\\n\\n \"The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,\" began Elphias in a voice stiff with emotion, \"is, I should have thought, quite clear. He was so devastated by her death ¨C \"\\n\\n \"Why did nobody ever see her, Elphias?\" squawked Muriel, \"Why did half of us never even know she existed, until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her? Where was saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar? Off being brilliant at Hogwarts, and never mind what was going on in his own house!\"\\n\\n \"What d\u0027you mean, locked in the cellar?\" asked Harry. \"What is this?\"\\n\\n Doge looked wretched. Auntie Muriel cackled again and answered Harry.\\n\\n \"Dumbledore\u0027s mother was a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-born, though I heard she pretended otherwise-\"\\n\\n \"She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman,\" whispered Doge miserably, but Auntie Muriel ignored him.\\n\\n \"- proud and very domineering, the sort of witch who would have been mortified to produce a Squib-\"\\n\\n \"Ariana was not a Squib!\" wheezed Doge.\\n\\n \"So you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why she never attended Hogwarts!\" said Auntie Muriel. She turned back to Harry. \"In our day, Squibs were often hushed up, thought to take it to the extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didn\u0027t exist ¨C \"\\n\\n \"I tell you, that\u0027s not what happened!\" said Doge, but Auntie Muriel steamrollered on, still addressing Harry.\\n\\n Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the Muggle community... much kinder than trying to find them a place in the Wizarding world, where they must always be second class, but naturally Kendra Dumbledore wouldn\u0027t have dreamed of letting her daughter go to a Muggle school ¨C\\n\\n \"Ariana was delicate!\" said Doge desperately. \"Her health was always too poor to permit her ¨C \"\\n\\n \"- to permit her to leave the house?\" cackled Muriel. \"And yet she was never taken to St. Mungo\u0027s and no Healer was ever summoned to see her!\"\\n\\n \"Really, Muriel, how can you possibly know whether ¨C \"\\n\\n \"For your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot was a Healer at St. Mungo\u0027s at the time, and he told my family in strictest confidence that Ariana had never been seen there. All most suspicious, Lancelot thought!\"\\n\\n Doge looked to be on the verge of tears. Auntie Muriel, who seemed to be enjoying herself hugely, snapped her fingers for more champagne. Numbly Harry thought of how the Dursleys had once shut him up, locked him away, kept him out of sight, all for the crime of being a wizard. Had Dumbledore\u0027s sister suffered the same fate in reverse: imprisoned for her lack of magic? And had Dumbledore truly left her to her fate while he went off to Hogwarts to prove himself brilliant and talented?\\n\\n \"Now, if Kendra hadn\u0027t died first,\" Muriel resumed, \"I\u0027d have said that it was she who finished off Ariana ¨C \"\\n\\n \"How can you, Muriel!\" groaned Doge. \"A mother kill her own daughter? Think what you\u0027re saying!\"\\n\\n \"If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end, why not?\" shrugged Auntie Muriel. \"But as I say, it doesn\u0027t fit, because Kendra died before Ariana ¨C of what, nobody ever seemed sure-\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed Kendra in the struggle,\" said Auntie Muriel thoughtfully. \"Shake your head all you like, Elphias. You were at Ariana\u0027s funeral, were you not?\"\\n\\n \"Yes I was,\" said Doge, through trembling lips, \"and a more desperately sad occasion I cannot remember. Albus was heartbroken-\"\\n\\n \"His heart wasn\u0027t the only thing. Didn\u0027t Aberforth break Albus\u0027 nose halfway through the service?\"\\n\\n If Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how he looked now. Muriel might have stabbed him. She cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne, which dribbled down her chin.\\n\\n \"How do you -?\" croaked Doge.\\n\\n \"My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot,\" said Auntie Muriel happily. \"Bathilda described the whole thing to mother while I was listening at the door. A coffin-side brawl. The way Bathilda told it, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus\u0027 fault that Ariana was dead and then punched him in the face. According to Bathilda, Albus did not even defend himself, and that\u0027s odd enough in itself. Albus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his back.\"\\n\\n Muriel swigged yet more champagne. The recitation of those old scandals seemed to elate her as much as they horrified Doge. Harry did not know what to think, what to believe. He wanted the truth and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had been ill. Harry could hardly believe that Dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside his own house, and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story.\\n\\n \"And I\u0027ll tell you something else,\" Muriel said, hiccupping slightly as she lowered her goblet. \"I think Bathilda has spilled the beans to Rita Skeeter. All those hints in Skeeter\u0027s interview about an important source close to the Dumbledores ¨C goodness knows she was there all through the Ariana business, and it would fit!\"\\n\\n \"Bathilda, would never talk to Rita Skeeter!\" whispered Doge.\\n\\n \"Bathilda Bagshot?\" Harry said. \"The author of A History of Magic?\"\\n\\n The name was printed on the front of one of Harry\u0027s textbooks, though admittedly not one of the ones he had read more attentively.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Doge, clutching at Harry\u0027s question like a drowning man at a life heir. \"A most gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"Quite gaga these days, I\u0027ve heard,\" said Auntie Muriel cheerfully.\\n\\n \"If that is so, it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have taken advantage of her,\" said Doge, \"and no reliance can be placed on anything Bathilda may have said!\"\\n\\n \"Oh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and I\u0027m sure Rita Skeeter knows them all,\" said Auntie Muriel \"But even if Bathilda\u0027s completely cuckoo, I\u0027m sure she\u0027d still have old photographs, maybe even letters. She knew the Dumbledores for years.... Well worth a trip to Godric\u0027s Hollow, I\u0027d have thought.\"\\n\\n Harry, who had been taking a sip of butterbeer, choked. Doge banged him on the back as Harry coughed, looking at Auntie Muriel through streaming eyes. Once he had control of his voice again, he asked, \"Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric\u0027s Hollow?\"\\n\\n \"Oh yes, she\u0027s been there forever! The Dumbledores moved there after Percival was imprisoned, and she was their neighbor.\"\\n\\n \"The Dumbledores lived in Godric\u0027s Hollows?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Barry, that\u0027s what I just said,\" said Auntie Muriel testily.\\n\\n Harry felt drained, empty. Never once, in six years, had Dumbledore told Harry that they had both lived and lost loved ones in Godric\u0027s Hollow. Why? Were Lily and James buried close to Dumbledore\u0027s mother and sister? Had Dumbledore visited their graves, perhaps walked past Lily\u0027s and James\u0027s to do so? And he had never once told Harry ... never bothered to say...\\n\\n And why it was so important, Harry could not explain even to himself, yet he felt it had been tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these experiences in common. He stared ahead of him, barely noticing what was going on around him, and did not realize that Hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she drew up a chair beside him.\\n\\n \"I simply can\u0027t dance anymore,\" she panted, slipping of one of her shoes and rubbing the sole of her foot. \"Ron\u0027s gone looking to find more butterbeers. It\u0027s a bit odd. I\u0027ve just seen Viktor storming away from Luna\u0027s father, it looked like they\u0027d been arguing ¨C \" She dropped her voice, staring at him. \"Harry, are you okay?\"\\n\\n Harry did not know where to begin, but it did not matter, at that moment, something large and silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor. Graceful and gleaming, the lynx landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers. Heads turned, as those nearest it froze absurdly in mid-dance. Then the Patronus\u0027s mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud, deep, slow voice of Kingsley Shacklebolt.\\n\\n \"The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-harry-potter-7/page-8.html","bookId":1567,"book":{"id":1567,"title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter #7)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \\n (Harry Potter #7) \\n Readers beware. The brilliant, breathtaking conclusion to J.K. Rowling\u0027s spellbinding series is not for the faint of heart--such revelations, battles, and betrayals await in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows that no fan will make it to the end unscathed. Luckily, Rowling has prepped loyal readers for the end of her series by doling out increasingly dark and dangerous tales of magic and mystery, shot through with lessons about honor and contempt, love and loss, and right and wrong. Fear not, you will find no spoilers in our review--to tell the plot would ruin the journey, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is an odyssey the likes of which Rowling\u0027s fans have not yet seen, and are not likely to forget. But we would be remiss if we did not offer one small suggestion before you embark on your final adventure with Harry--bring plenty of tissues. \\n The heart of Book 7 is a hero\u0027s mission--not just in Harry\u0027s quest for the Horcruxes, but in his journey from boy to man--and Harry faces more danger than that found in all six books combined, from the direct threat of the Death Eaters and you-know-who, to the subtle perils of losing faith in himself. Attentive readers would do well to remember Dumbledore\u0027s warning about making the choice between \"what is right and what is easy,\" and know that Rowling applies the same difficult principle to the conclusion of her series. While fans will find the answers to hotly speculated questions about Dumbledore, Snape, and you-know-who, it is a testament to Rowling\u0027s skill as a storyteller that even the most astute and careful reader will be taken by surprise. \\n A spectacular finish to a phenomenal series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a bittersweet read for fans. The journey is hard, filled with events both tragic and triumphant, the battlefield littered with the bodies of the dearest and despised, but the final chapter is as brilliant and blinding as a phoenix\u0027s flame, and fans and skeptics alike will emerge from the confines of the story with full but heavy hearts, giddy and grateful for the experience.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-harry-potter-7.jpg","author":"J.K.
