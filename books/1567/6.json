{"id":109809,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"The shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the house in the days that followed; Harry kept expecting to see him stumping in through the back door like the other Order members, who passed in and out to relay news. Harry felt that nothing but action would assuage his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to find and destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible.\n \"Well, you can\u0027t do anything about the\" ¨C Ron mouthed the word Horcruxes ¨C \"till you\u0027re seventeen. You\u0027ve still got the Trace on you. And we can plan here as well as anywhere, can\u0027t we? Or,\" he dropped his voice to a whisper, \"d\u0027you reckon you already know where the You-Know-Whats are?\"\n \"No,\" Harry admitted.\n \"I think Hermione\u0027s been doing a bit of research,\" said Ron. \"She said she was saving it for when you got here.\"\n They were sitting at the breakfast table; Mr. Weasley and Bill had just left for work. Mrs. Weasley had gone upstairs to wake Hermione and Ginny, while Fleur had drifted off to take a bath.\n \"The Trace\u0027ll break on the thirty-first,\" said Harry. \"That means I only need to stay here four days. Then I can ¨C \"\n \"Five days,\" Ron corrected him firmly. \"We\u0027ve got to stay for the wedding. They\u0027ll kill us if we miss it.\"\n Harry understood \"they\" to mean Fleur and Mrs. Weasley.\n \"It\u0027s one extra day,\" said Ron, when Harry looked mutinous.\n \"Don\u0027t they realize how important ¨C?\"\n \"\u0027Course they don\u0027t,\" said Ron. \"They haven\u0027t got a clue. And now you mention it, I wanted to talk to you about that.\"\n Ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that Mrs. Weasley was not returning yet, then leaned in closer to Harry.\n \"Mum\u0027s been trying to get it out of Hermione and me. What we\u0027re off to do. She\u0027ll try you next, so brace yourself. Dad and Lupin\u0027ve both asked as well, but when we said Dumbledore told you not to tell anyone except us, they dropped it. Not Mum, though. She\u0027s determined.\"\n Ron\u0027s prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch, Mrs. Weasley detached Harry from the others by asking him to help identify a lone man\u0027s sock that she thought might have come out of his rucksack. Once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery off the kitchen, she started.\n \"Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of Hogwarts,\" she began in a light, casual tone.\n \"Oh,\" said Harry. \"Well, yeah. We are.\"\n The mangle turned of its own accord in a corner, wringing out what looked like one of Mr. Weasley\u0027s vests.\n \"May I ask why you are abandoning your education?\" said Mrs. Weasley.\n \"Well, Dumbledore left me... stuff to do,\" mumbled Harry. \"Ron and Hermione know about it, and they want to come too.\"\n \"What sort of \u0027stuff\u0027?\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, I can\u0027t ¨C \"\n \"Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and I\u0027m sure Mr. And Mrs. Granger would agree!\" said Mrs. Weasley. Harry had been afraid of the \"concerned parent\" attack. He forced himself to look directly into her eyes, noticing as he did so that they were precisely the same shade of brown as Ginny\u0027s. This did not help.\n \"Dumbledore didn\u0027t want anyone else to know, Mrs. Weasley. I\u0027m sorry. Ron and Hermione don\u0027t have to come, it\u0027s their choice ¨C \"\n \"I don\u0027t see that you have to go either!\" she snapped, dropping all pretense now. \"You\u0027re barely of age, any of you! It\u0027s utter nonsense, if Dumbledore needed work doing, he had the whole Order at his command! Harry, you must have misunderstood him. Probably he was telling you something he wanted done, and you took it to mean that he wanted you¨C\"\n \"I didn\u0027t misunderstand,\" said Harry flatly. \"It\u0027s got to be me.\"\n He handed her back the single sock he was supposed to be identifying, which was patterned with golden bulrushes.\n \"And that\u0027s not mine. I don\u0027t support Puddlemere United.\"\n \"Oh, of course not,\" said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return to her casual tone. \"I should have realized. Well, Harry, while we\u0027ve still got you here, you won\u0027t mind helping with the preparations for Bill and Fleur\u0027s wedding, will you? There\u0027s still so much to do.\"\n \"No ¨C I ¨C of course not,\" said Harry, disconcerted by this sudden change of subject.\n \"Sweet of you,\" she replied, and she smiled as she left the scullery.\n From that moment on, Mrs. Weasley kept Harry, Ron and Hermione so busy with preparations for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think. The kindest explanation of this behavior would have been that Mrs. Weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of Mad-Eye and the terrors of their recent journey. After two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning, of color-matching favors, ribbons, and flowers, of de-gnoming the garden and helping Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of canap¨¦s, however, Harry started to suspect her of a different motive. All the jobs she handed out seemed to keep him, Ron, and Hermione away from one another; he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone since the first night, when he had told them about Voldemort torturing Ollivander.\n \"I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning, she\u0027ll be able to delay you leaving,\" Ginny told Harry in an undertone, as they laid the table for dinner on the third night of his stay.\n \"And then what does she think\u0027s going to happen?\" Harry muttered. \"Someone else might kill off Voldemort while she\u0027s holding us here making vol-au-vents?\"\n He had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginny\u0027s face whiten.\n \"So it\u0027s true?\" she said. \"That\u0027s what you\u0027re trying to do?\"\n \"I ¨C not ¨C I was joking,\" said Harry evasively.\n They stared at each other, and there was something more than shock in Ginny\u0027s expression. Suddenly Harry became aware that this was the first time that he had been alone with her since those stolen hours in secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds. He was sure she was remembering them too. Both of them jumped as the door opened, and Mr. Weasley, Kingsley, and Bill walked in.\n They were often joined by other Order members for dinner now, because the Burrow had replaced number twelve, Grimmauld Place as the headquarters. Mr. Weasley had explained that after the death of Dumbledore, their Secret-Keeper, each of the people to whom Dumbledore had confided Grimmauld Place\u0027s location had become a Secret-Keeper in turn.\n \"And as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the power of the Fidelius Charm. Twenty times as many opportunities for the Death Eaters to get the secret out of somebody. We can\u0027t expect it to hold much longer.\"\n \"But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by now?\" asked Harry.\n \"Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he turns up there again. We hope they\u0027ll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about the place, but we can\u0027t be sure. It would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters now that its protection has become so shaky.\"\n The kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to maneuver knives and forks. Harry found himself crammed beside Ginny; the unsaid things that had just passed between them made him wish they had been separated by a few more people. He was trying so hard to avoid brushing her arm he could barely cut his chicken.\n \"No news about Mad-Eye?\" Harry asked Bill.\n \"Nothing,\" replied Bill.\n They had not been able to hold a funeral for Moody, because Bill and Lupin had failed to recover his body. It had been difficult to know where he might have fallen, given the darkness and the confusion of the battle.\n \"The Daily Prophet hasn\u0027t said a word about him dying or about finding the body,\" Bill went on. \"But that doesn\u0027t mean much. It\u0027s keeping a lot quiet these days.\"\n \"And they still haven\u0027t called a hearing about all the underage magic I used escaping the Death Eaters?\" Harry called across the table to Mr. Weasley, who shook his head.\n \"Because they know I had no choice or because they don\u0027t want me to tell the world Voldemort attacked me?\"\n \"The latter, I think. Scrimgeour doesn\u0027t want to admit that You-Know-Who is as powerful as he is, nor that Azkaban\u0027s seen a mass breakout.\"\n \"Yeah, why tell the public the truth?\" said Harry, clenching his knife so tightly that the faint scars on the back of his right hand stood out, white against his skin: I must not tell lies.\n \"Isn\u0027t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him?\" asked Ron angrily.\n \"Of course, Ron, but people are terrified,\" Mr. Weasley replied, \"terrified that they will be next to disappear, their children the next to be attacked! There are nasty rumors going around; I for one don\u0027t believe the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts resigned. She hasn\u0027t been seen for weeks now. Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day; I just hope he\u0027s working on a plan.\"\n There was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley magicked the empty plates onto the work surface and served apple tart.\n \"We must decide \u0027ow you will be disguised, \u0027Arry,\" said Fleur, once everyone had pudding. \"For ze wedding,\" she added, when he looked confused. \"Of course, none of our guests are Death Eaters, but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey \u0027ave \u0027ad champagne.\"\n From this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid.\n \"Yes, good point,\" said Mrs. Weasley from the top of the table where she sat, spectacles perched on the end of her nose, scanning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece of parchment. \"Now, Ron, have you cleaned out your room yet?\"\n \"Why?\" exclaimed Ron, slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother. \"Why does my room have to be cleaned out? Harry and I are fine with it the way it is!\"\n \"We are holding your brother\u0027s wedding here in a few days\u0027 time, young man ¨C \"\n \"And are they getting married in my bedroom?\" asked Ron furiously. \"No! So why in the name of Merlin\u0027s saggy left ¨C \"\n \"Don\u0027t talk to your mother like that,\" said Mr. Weasley firmly. \"And do as you\u0027re told.\"\n Ron scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of his apple tart.\n \"I can help, some of it\u0027s my mess.\" Harry told Ron, but Mrs. Weasley cut across him.\n \"No, Harry, dear, I\u0027d much rather you helped Arthur much out the chickens, and Hermione, I\u0027d be ever so grateful if you\u0027d change the sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour; you know they\u0027re arriving at eleven tomorrow morning.\"\n But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens. \"There\u0027s no need to, er, mention it to Molly,\" Mr. Weasley told Harry, blocking his access to the coop, \"but, er, Ted Tonks sent me most of what was left of Sirius\u0027s bike and, er, I\u0027m hiding ¨C that\u0027s to say, keeping ¨C it in here. Fantastic stuff: There\u0027s an exhaust gaskin, as I believe it\u0027s called, the most magnificent battery, and it\u0027ll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work. I\u0027m going to try and put it all back together again when Molly\u0027s not ¨C I mean, when I\u0027ve got time.\"\n When they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to be seen, so Harry slipped upstairs to Ron\u0027s attic bedroom.\n \"I\u0027m doing it, I\u0027m doing ¨C! Oh, it\u0027s you,\" said Ron in relief, as Harry entered the room. Ron lay back down on the bed, which he had evidently just vacated. The room was just as messy as it had been all week; the only chance was that Hermione was now sitting in the far corner, her fluffy ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her feet, sorting books, some of which Harry recognized as his own, into two enormous piles.\n \"Hi, Harry,\" she said, as he sat down on his camp bed.\n \"And how did you manage to get away?\"\n \"Oh, Ron\u0027s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday,\" said Hermione. She threw Numerology and Grammatica onto one pile and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts onto the other.\n \"We were just talking about Mad-Eye,\" Ron told Harry. \"I reckon he might have survived.\"\n \"But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,\" said Harry.\n \"Yeah, but Bill was under attack too,\" said Ron. \"How can he be sure what he saw?\"\n \"Even if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a thousand feet,\" said Hermione, now weight Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland in her hand.\n \"He could have used a Shield Charm ¨C \"\n \"Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,\" said Harry.\n \"Well, all right, if you want him to be dead,\" said Ron grumpily, punching his pillow into a more comfortable shape.\n \"Of course we don\u0027t want him to be dead!\" said Hermione, looking shocked. \"It\u0027s dreadful that he\u0027s dead! But we\u0027re being realistic!\"\n For the first time, Harry imagined Mad-Eye\u0027s body, broken as Dumbledore\u0027s had been, yet with that one eye still whizzing in its socket. He felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to laugh.\n \"The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that\u0027s why no one\u0027s found him,\" said Ron wisely.\n \"Yeah,\" said Harry. \"Like Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and buried in Hagrid\u0027s front garden. They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed him ¨C \"\n \"Don\u0027t!\" squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just in time to see her burst into tears over her copy of Spellman\u0027s Syllabary.\n \"Oh no,\" said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed. \"Hermione, I wasn\u0027t trying to upset ¨C \"\n But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off the bed and got there first. One arm around Hermione, he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a revolting-looking handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier. Hastily pulling out his wand, he pointed it at the rag and said, \"Tergeo.\"\n The wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased with himself, Ron handed the slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione.\n \"Oh... thanks, Ron.... I\u0027m sorry....\" She blew her nose and hiccupped. \"It\u0027s just so awf-ful, isn\u0027t it? R-right after Dumbledore... I j-just n-never imagined Mad-Eye dying, somehow, he seemed so tough!\"\n \"Yeah, I know,\" said Ron, giving her a squeeze. \"But you know what he\u0027d say to us if he was here?\"\n \"\u0027C-constant vigilance,\u0027\" said Hermione, mopping her eyes.\n \"That\u0027s right,\" said Ron, nodding. \"He\u0027d tell us to learn from what happened to him. And what I\u0027ve learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit, Mundungus.\"\n Hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books. A second later, Ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders; she had dropped The Monster of Monsters on his foot. The book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at Ron\u0027s ankle.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m sorry!\" Hermione cried as Harry wrenched the book from Ron\u0027s leg and retied it shit.\n \"What are you doing with all those books anyway?\" Ron asked, limping back to his bed.\n \"Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,\" said Hermione, \"When we\u0027re looking for the Horcruxes.\"\n \"Oh, of course,\" said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. \"I forgot we\u0027ll be hunting down Voldemort in a mobile library.\"\n \"Ha ha,\" said Hermione, looking down at Spellman\u0027s Syllabary. \"I wonder... will we need to translate runes? It\u0027s possible.... I think we\u0027d better take it, to be safe.\"\n She dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up Hogwarts, A History.\n \"Listen,\" said Harry.\n He had sat up straight. Ron and Hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance.\n \"I know you said after Dumbledore\u0027s funeral that you wanted to come with me,\" Harry began.\n \"Here he goes,\" Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes.\n \"As we knew he would,\" he sighed, turning back to the books. \"You know, I think I will take Hogwarts, A History. Even if we\u0027re not going back there, I don\u0027t think I\u0027d feel right if I didn\u0027t have it with ¨C \"\n \"Listen!\" said Harry again.\n \"No, Harry, you listen,\" said Hermione. \"We\u0027re coming with you. That was decided months ago ¨C years, really.\"\n \"But ¨C \"\n \"Shut up,\" Ron advised him.\n \"¨C are you sure you\u0027ve thought this through?\" Harry persisted.\n \"Let\u0027s see,\" said Hermione, slamming Travels with Trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather fierce look. \"I\u0027ve been packing for days, so we\u0027re ready to leave at a moment\u0027s notice, which for your information has included doing some pretty difficult magic, not to mention smuggling Mad-Eye\u0027s whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right under Ron\u0027s mum\u0027s nose.\"\n \"I\u0027ve also modified my parents\u0027 memories so that they\u0027re convinced they\u0027re really called Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life\u0027s ambition is to move to Australia, which they have now done. That\u0027s to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate them about me ¨C or you, because unfortunately, I\u0027ve told them quite a bit about you.\"\n \"Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I\u0027ll find Mum and Dad and lift the enchantment. If I don\u0027t ¨C well, I think I\u0027ve cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy. Wendell and Monica Wilkins don\u0027t know that they\u0027ve got a daughter, you see.\"\n Hermione\u0027s eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back off the bed, put his arm around her once more, and frowned at Harry as though reproaching him for lack of tact. Harry could not think of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual for Ron to be teaching anyone else tact.\n \"I ¨C Hermione, I\u0027m sorry ¨C I didn\u0027t ¨C \"\n \"Didn\u0027t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you? Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what you\u0027ve done.\"\n \"Nah, he\u0027s just eaten,\" said Ron.\n \"Go on, he needs to know!\"\n \"Oh, all right. Harry, come here.\"\n For the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and stumped over to the door.\n \"C\u0027mon.\"\n \"Why?\" Harry asked, following Ron out of the room onto the tiny landing.\n \"Descendo,\" muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling. A hatch opened right over their heads and a ladder slid down to their feet. A horrible, half-sucking, half-moaning sound came out of the square hole, along with an unpleasant smell like open drains.\n \"That\u0027s your ghoul, isn\u0027t it?\" asked Harry, who had never actually met the creature that sometimes disrupted the nightly silence.\n \"Yeah, it is,\" said Ron, climbing the ladder. \"Come and have a look at him.\"\n Harry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space. His head and shoulders were in the room before he caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet from him, fast asleep in the gloom with its large mouth wide open.\n \"But it... it looks... do ghouls normally wear pajamas?\"\n \"No,\" said Ron. \"Nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustules.\"\n Harry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was human in shape and size, and was wearing what, now that Harry\u0027s eyes became used to the darkness, was clearly an old pair of Ron\u0027s pajamas. He was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald, rather than distinctly hairy and covered in angry purple blisters.\n \"He\u0027s me, see?\" said Ron.\n \"No,\" said Harry. \"I don\u0027t.\"\n \"I\u0027ll explain it back in my room, the smell\u0027s getting to me,\" said Ron. They climbed back down the ladder, which Ron returned to the ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books.\n \"Once we\u0027ve left, the ghoul\u0027s going to come and live down here in my room,\" said Ron. \"I think he\u0027s really looking forward to it ¨C well, it\u0027s hard to tell, because all he can do is moan and drool ¨C but he nods a lot when you mention it. Anyway, he\u0027s going to be me with spattergroit. Good, eh?\"\n Harry merely looked his confusion.\n \"It is!\" said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped the brilliance of the plan. \"Look, when we three don\u0027t turn up at Hogwarts again, everyone\u0027s going to think Hermione and I must be with you, right? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for our families to see if they\u0027ve got information on where you are.\"\n \"But hopefully it\u0027ll look like I\u0027ve gone away with Mum and Dad; a lot of Muggle-borns are talking about going into hiding at the moment,\" said Hermione.\n \"We can\u0027t hide my whole family, it\u0027ll look too fishy and they can\u0027t all leave their jobs,\" said Ron. \"So we\u0027re going to put out the story that I\u0027m seriously ill with spattergroit, which is why I can\u0027t go back to school. If anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or Dad can show them the ghoul in my bed, covered in pustules. Spattergroit\u0027s really contagious, so they\u0027re not going to want to go near him. It won\u0027t matter that he can\u0027t say anything, either, because apparently you can\u0027t once the fungus has spread to your uvula.\"\n \"And your mum and dad are in on this plan?\" asked Harry.\n \"Dad is. He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul. Mum... well, you\u0027ve seen what she\u0027s like. She won\u0027t accept we\u0027re going till we\u0027re gone.\"\n There was silence in the room, broken only by gentle thuds as Hermione continued to throw books onto one pile or the other. Ron sat watching her, and Harry looked from one to the other, unable to say anything. The measure they had taken to protect their families made him realize, more than anything else could have done, that they really were going to come with him and that they knew exactly how dangerous that would be. He wanted to tell them what that meant to him, but he simply could not find words important enough.\n Through the silence came the muffled sounds of Mrs. Weasley shouting from four floors below.\n \"Ginny\u0027s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,\" said Ron. \"I dunno why the Delacours have got to come two days before the wedding.\"\n \"Fleur\u0027s sister\u0027s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal, and she\u0027s too young to come on her own,\" said Hermione, as she pored indecisively over Break with a Banshee.\n \"Well, guests aren\u0027t going to help Mum\u0027s stress levels,\" said Ron.\n \"What we really need to decide,\" said Hermione, tossing Defensive Magical Theory into the bin without a second glance and picking up An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe, \"is where we\u0027re going after we leave here. I know you said you wanted to go to Godric\u0027s Hollow first, Harry, and I understand why, but... well... shouldn\u0027t we make the Horcruxes our priority?\"\n \"If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I\u0027d agree with you,\" said Harry, who did not believe that Hermione really understood his desire to return to Godric\u0027s Hollow. His parents\u0027 graves were only part of the attraction: He had a strong, though inexplicable, feeling that the place held answers for him. Perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived Voldemort\u0027s Killing Curse; now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn to the place where it had happened, wanting to understand.\n \"Don\u0027t you think there\u0027s a possibility that Voldemort\u0027s keeping a watch on Godric\u0027s Hollow?\" Hermione asked. \"He might expect you to go back and visit your parents\u0027 graves once you\u0027re free to go wherever you like?\"\n This had not occurred to Harry. While he struggled to find a counterargument, Ron spoke up, evidently following his own train of thought.\n \"This R.A.B. person,\" he said. \"You know, the one who stole the real locket?\"\n Hermione nodded.\n \"He said in his note he was going to destroy it, didn\u0027t he?\"\n Harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake Horcrux in which R.A.B.\u0027s note was still folded.\n \"\u0027I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.\u0027\" Harry read out.\n \"Well, what if he did finish it off?\" said Ron.\n \"Or she.\" Interposed Hermione.\n \"Whichever,\" said Ron. \"it\u0027d be one less for us to do!\"\n \"Yes, but we\u0027re still going to have to try and trace the real locket, aren\u0027t we?\" said Hermione, \"to find out whether or not it\u0027s destroyed.\"\n \"And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux?\" asked Ron.\n \"Well,\" said Hermione, \"I\u0027ve been researching that.\"\n \"How?\" asked Harry. \"I didn\u0027t think there were any books on Horcruxes in the library?\"\n \"There weren\u0027t,\" said Hermione, who had turned pink. \"Dumbledore removed them all, but he ¨C he didn\u0027t destroy them.\"\n Ron sat up straight, wide-eyed.\n \"How in the name of Merlin\u0027s pants have you managed to get your hands on those Horcrux books?\"\n \"It ¨C it wasn\u0027t stealing!\" said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron with a kind of desperation. \"They were still library books, even if Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves. Anyway, if he really didn\u0027t want anyone to get at them, I\u0027m sure he would have made it much harder to ¨C \"\n \"Get to the point!\" said Ron.\n \"Well... it was easy,\" said Hermione in a small voice. \"I just did a Summoning Charm. You know ¨C Accio. And ¨C they zoomed out of Dumbledore\u0027s study window right into the girls\u0027 dormitory.\"\n \"But when did you do this?\" Harry asked, regarding Hermione with a mixture of admiration and incredulity.\n \"Just after his ¨C Dumbledore\u0027s ¨C funeral,\" said Hermione in an even smaller voice. \"Right after we agreed we\u0027d leave school and go and look for the Horcruxes. When I went back upstairs to get my things it ¨C it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them, the better it would be... and I was alone in there... so I tried... and it worked. They flew straight in through the open window and I ¨C I packed them.\"\n She swallowed and then said imploringly, \"I can\u0027t believe Dumbledore would have been angry, it\u0027s not as though we\u0027re going to use the information to make a Horcrux, is it?\"\n \"Can you hear us complaining?\" said Ron. \"Where are these books anyway?\"\n Hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a large volume, bound in faded black leather. She looked a little nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something recently dead.\n \"This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux. Secrets of the Darkest Art ¨C it\u0027s a horrible book, really awful, full of evil magic. I wonder when Dumbledore removed it from the library.... if he didn\u0027t do it until he was headmaster, I bet Voldemort got all the instruction he needed from here.\"\n \"Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if he\u0027d already read that?\" asked Ron.\n \"He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven,\" said Harry. \"Dumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to make a Horcrux by the time he asked Slughorn about them. I think you\u0027re right, Hermione, that could easily have been where he got the information.\"\n \"And the more I\u0027ve read about them,\" said Hermione, \"the more horrible they seem, and the less I can believe that he actually made six. It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of your soul by ripping it, and that\u0027s just by making one Horcrux!\"\n Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort moving beyond \"usual evil.\"\n \"Isn\u0027t there any way of putting yourself back together?\" Ron asked.\n \"Yes,\" said Hermione with a hollow smile, \"but it would be excruciatingly painful.\"\n \"Why? How do you do it?\" asked Harry.\n \"Remorse,\" said Hermione. \"You\u0027ve got to really feel what you\u0027ve done. There\u0027s a footnote. Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can\u0027t see Voldemort attempting it somehow, can you?\"\n \"No,\" said Ron, before Harry could answer. \"So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that book?\"\n \"Yes,\" said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, \"because it warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I\u0027ve read, what Harry did to Riddle\u0027s diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a Horcrux.\"\n \"What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?\" asked Harry.\n \"Oh well, lucky we\u0027ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,\" said Ron. \"I was wondering what we were going to do with them.\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t have to be a basilisk fang,\" said Hermione patiently. \"It has to be something so destructive that the Horcrux can\u0027t repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it\u0027s incredibly rare ¨C \"\n \"¨C phoenix tears,\" said Harry, nodding.\n \"Exactly,\" said Hermione. \"Our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as basilisk venom, and they\u0027re all dangerous to carry around with you. That\u0027s a problem we\u0027re going to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux won\u0027t do the trick. You\u0027ve got to put it beyond magical repair.\"\n \"But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,\" said Ron, \"why can\u0027t the bit of soul in it just go and live in something else?\"\n \"Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.\"\n Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on. \"Look, if I picked up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn\u0027t damage your soul at all.\"\n \"Which would be a real comfort to me, I\u0027m sure,\" said Ron. Harry laughed.\n \"It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will survive, untouched,\" said Hermione. \"But it\u0027s the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can\u0027t exist without it.\"\n \"That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,\" said Harry, remembering ink pouring like blood from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of Voldemort\u0027s soul as it vanished.\n \"And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist. Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but obviously it came back good as new.\"\n \"Hang on,\" said Ron, frowning. \"The bit of soul in that diary was possessing Ginny, wasn\u0027t it? How does that work, then?\"\n \"While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone if they get too close to the object. I don\u0027t mean holding it for too long, it\u0027s nothing to do with touching it,\" she added before Ron could speak. \"I mean close emotionally. Ginny poured her heart out into that diary, she made herself incredibly vulnerable. You\u0027re in trouble if you get too fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.\"\n \"I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?\" said Harry. \"Why didn\u0027t I ask him? I never really...\"\n His voice trailed away: He was thinking of all the things he should have asked Dumbledore, and of how, since the headmaster had died, it seemed to Harry that he had wasted so many opportunities when Dumbledore had been alive, to find out more... to find out everything....\n The silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a wall-shaking crash. Hermione shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art; Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing indignantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate Frog wrapper, and smacked his head on the opposite wall; and Harry instinctively dived for his wand before realizing that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted with rage.\n \"I\u0027m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,\" she said, her voice trembling. \"I\u0027m sure you all need your rest... but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I was under the impression that you had agreed to help.\"\n \"Oh yes,\" said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt to her feet, sending books flying in every direction. \"we will... we\u0027re sorry...\"\n With an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione hurried out of the room after Mrs. Weasley.\n \"it\u0027s like being a house-elf,\" complained Ron in an undertone, still massaging his head as he and Harry followed. \"Except without the job satisfaction. The sooner this wedding\u0027s over, the happier, I\u0027ll be.\"\n \"Yeah,\" said Harry, \"then we\u0027ll have nothing to do except find Horcruxes.... It\u0027ll be like a holiday, won\u0027t it?\"\n Ron started to laugh, but at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents waiting for them in Mrs. Weasley\u0027s room, stopped quite abruptly.\n The Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o\u0027 clock. Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny were feeling quite resentful toward Fleur\u0027s family by this time; and it was with ill grace that Ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks, and Harry attempted to flatten his hair. Once they had all been deemed smart enough, they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await the visitors.\n Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty cauldrons and old Wellington boots that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes standing either side of the door in large pots; though there was no breeze, the leaves waved lazily, giving an attractive rippling effect. The chickens had been shut away, the yard had been swept, and the nearby garden had been pruned, plucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry, who liked it in its overgrown state, thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent of capering gnomes.\n He had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the Burrow by both the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by magic directly into the place. Mr. Weasley had therefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a nearby hill, where they were to arrive by Portkey. The first sound of their approach was an unusually high-pitched laugh, which turned out to be coming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at the gate moments later, laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf green robes, who could be Fleur\u0027s mother.\n \"Maman!\" cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her. \"Papa!\"\n Monsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he was a head shorter and extremely plumb, with a little, pointed black beard. However, he looked good-natured. Bouncing towards Mrs. Weasley on high-heeled boots, he kissed her twice on each cheek, leaving her flustered.\n \"You \u0027ave been so much trouble,\" he said in a deep voice. \"Fleur tells us you \u0027ave been working very \u0027ard.\"\n \"Oh, it\u0027s been nothing, nothing!\" trilled Mrs. Weasley. \"No trouble at all!\"\n Ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out from behind one of the new Flutterby bushes.\n \"Dear lady!\" said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs. Weasley\u0027s hand between his own two plump ones and beaming. \"We are most honored at the approaching union of our two families! Let me present my wife, Apolline.\"\n Madame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss Mrs. Weasley too.\n \"Enchant¨¦e,\" she said. \"Your \u0027usband \u0027as been telling us such amusing stories!\"\n Mr. Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs. Weasley threw him a look, upon which he became immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend.\n \"And, of course, you \u0027ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!\" said Monsieur Delacour. Gabrielle was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old, with waist-length hair of pure, silvery blonde, she gave Mrs. Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw Harry a glowing look, batting her eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly.\n \"Well, come in, do!\" said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and she ushered the Delacours into the house, with many \"No, please!\"s and \"After you!\u0027s and \"Not at all!\u0027s.\n The Delacours, it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant guests. They were pleased with everything and keen to assist with the preparations for the wedding. Monsieur Delacour pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids\u0027 shoes \"Charmant!\" Madame Delacour was most accomplished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice; Gabrielle followed her elder sister around, trying to assist in any way she could and jabbering away in rapid French.\n On the downside, the Burrow was not built to accommodate so many people. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room, having shouted down Monsieur and Madame Delacour\u0027s protests and insisted they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was sleeping with Fleur in Percy\u0027s old room, and Bill would be sharing with Charlie, his best man, once Charlie arrived from Romania. Opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent, and it was in desperation that Harry, Ron and Hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape the overcrowded house.\n \"But she still won\u0027t leave us alone!\" snarled Ron, and their second attempt at a meeting in the yard was foiled by the appearance of Mrs. Weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in her arms.\n \"Oh, good, you\u0027ve fed the chickens,\" she called as she approached them. \"We\u0027d better shut them away again before the men arrive tomorrow... to put up the tent for the wedding,\" she explained, pausing to lean against the henhouse. She looked exhausted. \"Millamant\u0027s Magic Marquees... they\u0027re very good. Bill\u0027s escorting them.... You\u0027d better stay inside while they\u0027re here, Harry. I must say it does complicate organizing a wedding, having all these security spells around the place.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" said Harry humbly.\n \"Oh, don\u0027t be silly, dear!\" said Mrs. Weasley at once. \"I didn\u0027t mean ¨C well, your safety\u0027s much more important! Actually, I\u0027ve been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday, Harry. Seventeen, after all, it\u0027s an important day....\"\n \"I don\u0027t want a fuss,\" said Harry quickly, envisaging the additional strain this would put on them all. \"Really, Mrs. Weasley, just a normal dinner would be fine.... It\u0027s the day before the wedding....\"\n \"Oh, well, if you\u0027re sure, dear. I\u0027ll invite Remus and Tonks, shall I? And how about Hagrid?\"\n \"That\u0027d be great,\" said Harry. \"But please, don\u0027t go to loads of trouble.\"\n \"Not at all, not at all... It\u0027s no trouble....\"\n She looked at him, a long, searching look, then smiled a little sadly, straightened up, and walked away. Harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line, and the damp clothes rose into the air to hang themselves up, and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the inconvenience and the pain he was giving her. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-harry-potter-7/page-6.html","bookId":1567,"book":{"id":1567,"title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \n (Harry Potter #7) \n Readers beware. The brilliant, breathtaking conclusion to J.K. Rowling\u0027s spellbinding series is not for the faint of heart--such revelations, battles, and betrayals await in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows that no fan will make it to the end unscathed. Luckily, Rowling has prepped loyal readers for the end of her series by doling out increasingly dark and dangerous tales of magic and mystery, shot through with lessons about honor and contempt, love and loss, and right and wrong. Fear not, you will find no spoilers in our review--to tell the plot would ruin the journey, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is an odyssey the likes of which Rowling\u0027s fans have not yet seen, and are not likely to forget. But we would be remiss if we did not offer one small suggestion before you embark on your final adventure with Harry--bring plenty of tissues. \n The heart of Book 7 is a hero\u0027s mission--not just in Harry\u0027s quest for the Horcruxes, but in his journey from boy to man--and Harry faces more danger than that found in all six books combined, from the direct threat of the Death Eaters and you-know-who, to the subtle perils of losing faith in himself. Attentive readers would do well to remember Dumbledore\u0027s warning about making the choice between \"what is right and what is easy,\" and know that Rowling applies the same difficult principle to the conclusion of her series. While fans will find the answers to hotly speculated questions about Dumbledore, Snape, and you-know-who, it is a testament to Rowling\u0027s skill as a storyteller that even the most astute and careful reader will be taken by surprise. \n A spectacular finish to a phenomenal series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a bittersweet read for fans. The journey is hard, filled with events both tragic and triumphant, the battlefield littered with the bodies of the dearest and despised, but the final chapter is as brilliant and blinding as a phoenix\u0027s flame, and fans and skeptics alike will emerge from the confines of the story with full but heavy hearts, giddy and grateful for the experience.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-harry-potter-7.jpg","author":"J.K.
