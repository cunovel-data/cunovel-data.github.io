{"id":109833,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"Neville ¨C what the ¨C how ¨C?\"\\n\\n But Neville had spotted Ron and Hermione, and with yells of delight was hugging them too. The longer Harry looked at Neville, the worse he appeared: One of his eyes was swollen yellow and purple, there were gouge marks on his face, and his general air of unkemptness suggested that he had been living enough. Nevertheless, his battered visage shone with happiness as he let go of Hermione and said again, \"I knew you\u0027d come! Kept telling Seamus it was a matter of time!\"\\n\\n \"Neville, what\u0027s happened to you?\"\\n\\n \"What? This?\" Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head. \"This is nothing, Seamus is worse. You\u0027ll see. Shall we get going then? Oh,\" he turned to Aberforth, \"Ab, there might be a couple more people to the way.\"\\n\\n \"Couple more?\" repeated Aberforth ominously. \"What d\u0027you mean, a couple more, Longbottom? There\u0027s a curfew and a Camwaulding Charm on the whole village!\"\\n\\n \"I know, that\u0027s why they\u0027ll be Apparating directly into the bar,\" said Neville. \"Just send them down the passage when they get here, will you? Thanks a lot.\"\\n\\n Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her to climb up onto the mantelpiece and into the tunnel; Ron followed, then Neville. Harry addressed Aberforth.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know how to thank you. You\u0027ve saved our lives twice.\"\\n\\n \"Look after \u0027em, then,\" said Aberforth gruffly. \"I might not be able to save \u0027em a third time.\"\\n\\n Harry chambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole behind Ariana\u0027s portrait. There were smooth stone steps on the other side: It looked as though the passageway had been there for years. Brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy floor was worn and smooth; as they walked, their shadows rippled, fanlike, across the wall.\\n\\n \"How long\u0027s this been here?\" Ron asked as they set off. \"It isn\u0027t on the Marauder\u0027s Map, is it Harry? I thought there were only seven passages in and out of school?\"\\n\\n \"They sealed off all of those before the start of the year,\" said Neville. \"There\u0027s no chance of getting through any of them now, not with the curses over the entrances and Death Eaters and dementors waiting at the exits.\" He started walking backward, beaming, drinking them in. \"Never mind that stuff ... Is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a dragon? It\u0027s everywhere, everyone\u0027s talking about it, Terry Boot got beaten up by Carrow for yelling about it in the Great Hall at dinner!\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, it\u0027s true,\" said Harry.\\n\\n Neville laughed gleefully.\\n\\n \"What did you do with the dragon?\"\\n\\n \"Released it into the wild,\" said Ron. \"Hermione was all for keeping it as a pet\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t exaggerate, Ron ¨C \"\\n\\n \"But what have you been doing? People have been saying you\u0027ve just been on the run, Harry, but I don\u0027t think so. I think you\u0027ve been up to something.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right,\" said Harry, \"but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven\u0027t heard anything.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been .... Well, it\u0027s not really like Hogwarts anymore,\" said Neville, the smile fading from his face as he spoke. \"Do you know about the Carrows?\"\\n\\n \"Those two Death Eaters who teach here?\"\\n\\n \"They do more than teach,\" said Neville. \"They\u0027re in charge of all discipline. They like punishment, the Carrows.\"\\n\\n \"Like Umbridge?\"\\n\\n \"Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer us to the Carrows if we do anything wrong. They don\u0027t, though, if they can avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as much as we do.\"\\n\\n \"Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark Arts, except now it\u0027s just the Dark Arts. We\u0027re supposed to practice the Cruciatus Curse on people who\u0027ve earned detentions ¨C \"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n Harry, Ron, and Hermione\u0027s united voices echoed up and down the passage.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" said Neville. \"That\u0027s how I got this one,\" he pointed at a particularly deep gash in his cheek, \"I refused to do it. Some people are into it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time they\u0027ve ever been top in anything, I expect.\"\\n\\n \"Alecto, Amycus\u0027s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for everyone. We\u0027ve all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals, stupid and dirty, and how they drive wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the natural order is being reestablished. I got this one,\" he indicated another slash to his face, \"for asking her how much Muggle blood she and her brother have got.\"\\n\\n \"Blimey, Neville,\" said Ron, \"there\u0027s a time and a place for getting a smart mouth.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t see her,\" said Neville. \"You wouldn\u0027t have stood it either. The thing is, it helps when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, Harry.\"\\n\\n \"But they\u0027ve used you as a knife sharpener,\" said Ron, winding slightly as they passed a lamp and Neville\u0027s injuries were thrown into even greater relief.\\n\\n Neville shrugged.\\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t matter. They don\u0027t want to spill too much pure blood, so they\u0027ll torture us a bit if we\u0027re mouthy but they won\u0027t actually kill us.\"\\n\\n Harry did not know what was worse, the things that Neville was saying or the matter-of-fact tone in which he said them.\\n\\n \"The only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the outside are giving trouble. They get taken hostage. Old Xeno Lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in The Quibbler, so they dragged Luna off the train on the way back for Christmas.\"\\n\\n \"Neville, she\u0027s all right, we\u0027ve seen her ¨C \"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I know, she managed to get a message to me.\"\\n\\n From his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry recognized it as one of the fake Galleons that Dumbledore\u0027s Army had used to send one another messages.\\n\\n \"These have been great,\" said Neville, beaming at Hermione. \"The Carrows never rumbled how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We used to sneak out at night and put graffiti on the walls: Dumbledore\u0027s Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that. Snape hated it.\"\\n\\n \"You used to?\" said Harry, who had noticed the past tense.\\n\\n \"Well, it got more difficult as time went on.\" said Neville. \"We lost Luna at Christmas, and Ginny never came back after Easter, and the three of us were sort of the leaders. The Carrows seemed to know I was behind a lot of it, so they started coming down on me hard, and then Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year they\u0027d chained up, and they tortured him pretty badly. That scared people off.\"\\n\\n \"No kidding,\" muttered Ron, as the passage began to slope upward.\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, I couldn\u0027t ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped those kinds of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. That\u0027s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran.\"\\n\\n \"They what?\" said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage was climbing so steeply, \"well, you can see their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to behave. I s\u0027pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around. Thing was,\" he faced them, and Harry was astonished to see that he was grinning, \"they bit off a bit more than they could chew with Gran. Little old witch living alone, they probably thought hey didn\u0027t need to send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway,\" Neville laughed, \"Dawlish is still in St. Mungo\u0027s and Gran\u0027s on the run. She sent me a letter,\" he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, \"telling me she was proud of me, that I\u0027m my parent\u0027s son, and to keep it up.\"\\n\\n \"Cool,\" said Ron.\\n\\n \"Yea,\" said Neville happily. \"Only thing was, once they realized they had no hold over me, they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all. I don\u0027t know whether they were planning to kill me or send me to Azkaban, either way, I knew it was time to disappear.\"\\n\\n \"But,\" said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, \"aren\u0027t ¨C aren\u0027t we heading straight back for Hogwarts?\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Course,\" said Neville. \"You\u0027ll see. We\u0027re here.\"\\n\\n They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage. Another short flight of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind Ariana\u0027s portrait. Neville pushed it open and climbed through. As Harry followed, he heard Neville call out for unseen people:\\n\\n \"Look who it is! Didn\u0027t I tell you?\"\\n\\n As Harry emerged into the room behind the passage, there were several screams and yells: \"HARRY!\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Potter, it\u0027s POTTER!\"\\n\\n \"Ron!\"\\n\\n \"Hermione!\"\\n\\n He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps and many faces. The next moment, he, Ron, and Hermione were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the back, their hair ruffled, their hands shaken, by what seemed to be more than twenty people. They might have just won a Quidditch final.\\n\\n \"Okay, okay, calm down!\" Neville called, and as the crowd backed away, Harry was able to take in their surroundings.\\n\\n He did not recognize the dorm at all. It was enormous, and looked rather like the interior of a particularly sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ship\u0027s cabin. Multicolored hammocks were strung from the ceiling and from the balcony that ran around the dark wood-paneled and windowless walls, which were covered in bright tapestry hangings. Harry saw the gold Gryffindor lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. The silver and green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were bulging bookcases, a few broomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large wood-cased wireless.\\n\\n \"Where are we?\"\\n\\n \"Room of Requirement, of course!\" said Neville. \"Surpassed itself, hasn\u0027t it? The Carrows were chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a hideout: I managed to get through the door and this is what I found! Well, it wasn\u0027t exactly like this when I arrived, it was a load smaller, there was only one hammock and just Gryffindor hangings. But it\u0027s expanded as more and more of the D.A. have arrived.\"\\n\\n \"And the Carrows can\u0027t get in?\" asked Harry, looking around for the door.\\n\\n \"No,\" said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognized until he spoke: Seamus\u0027s face was bruised and puffy. \"It\u0027s a proper hideout, as long as one of us stays in here, they can\u0027t get at us, the door won\u0027t open. It\u0027s all down to Neville. He really gets this room. You\u0027ve got to ask for exactly what you need ¨C like, \u0027I don\u0027t want any Carrow supporters to be able to get in\u0027 ¨C and it\u0027ll do it for you! You\u0027ve just got to make sure you close the loopholes. Neville\u0027s the man!\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s quite straightforward, really,\" said Neville modestly. \"I\u0027d been in here about a day and a half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get something to eat, and that\u0027s when the passage to Hog\u0027s Head opened up. I went through it and met Aberforth. He\u0027s been providing us with food, because for some reason, that\u0027s the one thing the room doesn\u0027t really do.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, food\u0027s one of the five exceptions to Gamp\u0027s Law of Elemental Transfiguration,\" said Ron to general astonishment.\\n\\n \"So we\u0027ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,\" said Seamus, \"and it just makes more hammocks every time we need room, and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls started turning up ¨C \"\\n\\n \" ¨C and thought they\u0027d quite like to wash, yes,\" supplied Lavender Brown, whom Harry had not noticed until that point. Now that he looked around properly, he recognized many familiar faces. Both Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein, and Michael Corner.\\n\\n \"Tell us what you\u0027ve been up to, though,\" said Ernie. \"There\u0027ve been so many rumors, we\u0027ve been trying to keep up with you on Potterwatch.\" He pointed at the wireless. \"You didn\u0027t break into Gringotts?\"\\n\\n \"They did!\" said Neville. \"And the dragon\u0027s true too!\"\\n\\n There was a smattering of applause and a few whoops; Ron took a bow.\\n\\n \"What were you after?\" asked Seamus eagerly.\\n\\n Before any of them could parry the question with one of their own, Harry felt a terrible, scorching pain in the lightning scar. As he turned his back hastily on the curious and delighted faces, the Room of Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside a ruined stone shack, and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred golden box lay open and empty beside the hole, and Voldemort\u0027s scream of fury vibrated inside his head.\\n\\n With an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemort\u0027s mind again, back to where he stood, swaying, in the Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from his face and Ron holding him up.\\n\\n \"Are you all right, Harry?\" Neville was saying. \"What to sit down? I expect you\u0027re tired, aren\u0027t ¨C?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione, trying to tell them without words that Voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes. Time was running out fast: If Voldemort chose to visit Hogwarts next, they would miss their chance.\\n\\n \"We need to get going,\" he said, and their expressions told him that they understood.\\n\\n \"What are we going to do, then, Harry?\" asked Seamus. \"What\u0027s the plan?\"\\n\\n \"Plan?\" repeated Harry. He was exercising all his willpower to prevent himself succumbing again to Voldemort\u0027s rage: His scar was still burning. \"Well, there\u0027s something we ¨C Ron, Hermione, and I ¨C need to do, and then we\u0027ll get out of here.\"\\n\\n Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore. Neville looked confused.\\n\\n \"What d\u0027you mean, \u0027get out of here\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"We haven\u0027t come back to stay,\" said Harry, rubbing his scar, trying to soothe the pain. \"There\u0027s something important we need to do ¨C \"\\n\\n \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"I ¨C I can\u0027t tell you.\"\\n\\n There was a ripple of muttering at this: Neville\u0027s brows contracted.\\n\\n \"Why can\u0027t you tell us? It\u0027s something to do with fighting You-Know-Who, right?\"\\n\\n \"Well, yeah ¨C \"\\n\\n \"Then we\u0027ll help you.\"\\n\\n The other members of Dumbledore\u0027s Army were nodding, some enthusiastically, others solemnly. A couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate their willingness for immediate action.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t understand,\" Harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours. \"We ¨C we can\u0027t tell you. We\u0027ve got to do it ¨C alone.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" asked Neville.\\n\\n \"Because ...\" In his desperation to start looking for the missing Horcrux, or at least have a private discussion with Ron and Hermione about where they might commence their search. Harry found it difficult to gather his thoughts. His scar was still searing. \"Dumbledore left the three of us a job,\" he said carefully, \"and we weren\u0027t supposed to tell ¨C I mean, he wanted us to do it, just the three of us.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re his army,\" said Neville. \"Dumbledore\u0027s Army. We were all in it together, we\u0027ve been keeping it going while you three have been off on your own ¨C \"\\n\\n \"It hasn\u0027t exactly been a picnic, mate,\" said Ron.\\n\\n \"I never said it had, but I don\u0027t see why you can\u0027t trust us. Everyone in this room\u0027s been fighting and they\u0027ve been driven in here because the Carrows were hunting them down. Everyone in here\u0027s proven they\u0027re loyal to Dumbledore ¨C loyal to you.\"\\n\\n \"Look,\" Harry began, without knowing what he was going to say, but it did not matter. The tunnel door had just opened behind him.\\n\\n \"We got your message, Neville! Hello you three, I thought you must be here!\"\\n\\n It was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug his best friend.\\n\\n \"Hi, everyone!\" said Luna happily. \"Oh, it\u0027s great to be back!\"\\n\\n \"Luna,\" said Harry distractedly, \"what are you doing here? How did you ¨C?\"\\n\\n \"I sent for her,\" said Neville, holding up the fake Galleon. \"I promised her and Ginny that if you turned up I\u0027d let them know. We all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution. That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.\"\\n\\n \"Of course that\u0027s what it means,\" said Luna brightly. \"Isn\u0027t it, Harry? We\u0027re going to fight them out of Hogwarts?\"\\n\\n \"Listen,\" said Harry with a rising sense of panic, \"I\u0027m sorry, but that\u0027s not what we came back for. There\u0027s something we\u0027ve got to do, and then ¨C \"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to leave us in this mess?\" demanded Michael Cornet.\\n\\n \"No!\" said Ron. \"What we\u0027re doing will benefit everyone in the end, it\u0027s all about trying to get rid of You-Know-Who ¨C \"\\n\\n \"Then let us help!\" said Neville angrily. \"We want to be a part of it!\"\\n\\n There was another noise behind them, and Harry turned. His heart seemed to fall: Ginny was now climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Ginny gave Harry a radiant smile: He had forgotten, he had never fully appreciated, how beautiful she was, but he had never been less pleased to see her.\\n\\n \"Aberforth\u0027s getting a bit annoyed,\" said Fred, raising his hand in answer to several cries of greeting. \"He wants a kip, and his bar\u0027s turned into a railway station.\"\\n\\n Harry\u0027s mouth fell open. Right behind Lee Jordan came Harry\u0027s old girlfriend, Cho Chang. She smiled at him.\\n\\n \"I got the message,\" she said, holding up her own fake Galleon and she walked over to sit beside Michael Corner.\\n\\n \"So what\u0027s the plan, Harry?\" said George.\\n\\n \"There isn\u0027t one,\" said Harry, still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all these people, unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so fiercely.\\n\\n \"Just going to make it up as we go along, are we? My favorite kind,\" said Fred.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got to stop this!\" Harry told Neville. \"What did you call them all back for? This is insane ¨C \"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re fighting, aren\u0027t we?\" said Dean, taking out his fake Galleon. \"The message said Harry was back, and we were going to fight! I\u0027ll have to get a wand, though ¨C \"\\n\\n \"You haven\u0027t got a wand¨C?\" began Seamus.\\n\\n Ron turned suddenly to Harry.\\n\\n \"Why can\u0027t they help?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"They can help.\" He dropped his voice and said, so that none of them could hear but Hermione, who stood between them, \"We don\u0027t know where it is. We\u0027ve got to find it fast. We don\u0027t have to tell them it\u0027s a Horcrux.\"\\n\\n Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, \"I think Ron\u0027s right. We don\u0027t even know what we\u0027re looking for, we need them.\" And when Harry looked unconvinced, \"You don\u0027t have to do everything alone, Harry.\"\\n\\n Harry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head threatening to split again. Dumbledore had warned him against telling anyone but Ron and Hermione about the Horcruxes. Secrets and lies, that\u0027s how we grew up, and Albus ... he was a natural ... Was he turning into Dumbledore, keeping his secrets clutched to his chest, afraid to trust? But Dumbledore had trusted Snape, and where had that led? To murder at the top of the highest tower ...\\n\\n \"All right,\" he said quietly to the other two. \"Okay,\" he called to the room at large, and all noise ceased: Fred and George, who had been cracking jokes for the benefit of those nearest, fell silent, and all of the looked alert, excited.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s something we need to find,\" Harry said. \"Something ¨C something that\u0027ll help us overthrow You-Know-Who. It\u0027s here at Hogwarts, but we don\u0027t know where. It might have belonged to Ravenclaw. Has anyone heard of an object like that? Has anyone come across something with her eagle on it, for instance?\"\\n\\n He looked hopefully toward the little group of Ravenclaws, to Padma, Michael, Terry, and Cho, but it was Luna who answered, perched on the arm of Ginny\u0027s chair.\\n\\n \"Well, there\u0027s her lost diadem. I told you about it, remember, Harry? The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Daddy\u0027s trying to duplicate it.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but the lost diadem,\" said Michael Corner, rolling his eyes, \"is lost, Luna. That\u0027s sort of the point.\"\\n\\n \"When was it lost?\" asked Harry.\\n\\n \"Centuries ago, they say,\" said Cho, and Harry\u0027s heart sank. \"Professor Flitwick says the diadem vanished with Ravenclaw herself. People have looked, but,\" she appealed to her fellow Ravenclaws. \"Nobody\u0027s ever found a trace of it, have them?\"\\n\\n They all shook their heads.\\n\\n \"Sorry, but what is a diadem?\" asked Ron.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a kind of crown,\" said Terry Boot. \"Ravenclaw\u0027s was supposed to have magical properties, enhance the wisdom of the wearer.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Daddy\u0027s Wrackspurt siphons ¨C \"\\n\\n But Harry cut across Luna.\\n\\n \"And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it?\"\\n\\n They all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and his own disappointment was mirrored back at him. An object that had been lost this long, and apparently without trace, did not seem like a good candidate for the Horcrux hidden in the castle ... Before he could formulate a new question, however, Cho spoke again.\\n\\n \"If you\u0027d like to see what the diadem\u0027s supposed to look like, I could take you up to our common room and show you, Harry. Ravenclaw\u0027s wearing it in her statue.\"\\n\\n Harry\u0027s scar scorched again: For a moment the Room of Requirement swam before him, and he saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great snake wrapped around his shoulders. Voldemort was flying again, whether to the underground lake or here, to the castle, he did not know: Either way, there was hardly any time left.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s on the move,\" he said quietly to Ron and Hermione. He glanced at Cho and then back at them. \"Listen, I know it\u0027s not much of a lead, but I\u0027m going to go look at this statue, at least find out what the diadem looks like. Wait for me here and keep, you know ¨C the other one ¨C safe.\"\\n\\n Cho had got to her feet, but Ginny said rather fiercely, \"No, Luna will take Harry, won\u0027t you, Luna?\"\\n\\n \"Oooh, yes, I\u0027d like to,\" said Luna happily, as Cho sat down again, looking disappointed.\\n\\n \"How do we get out?\" Harry asked Neville.\\n\\n \"Over here.\"\\n\\n He led Harry and Luna to a corner, where a small cupboard opened onto a steep staircase. \"It comes out somewhere different every day, so they\u0027ve never been able to find it,\" he said. \"Only trouble is, we never know exactly where we\u0027re going to end up when we go out. Be careful, Harry, they\u0027re always patrolling the corridors at night.\"\\n\\n \"No problem,\" said Harry. \"See you in a bit.\"\\n\\n He and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by torches, and turned corners in unexpected places. At last they reached what appeared to be solid wall.\\n\\n \"Get under here,\" Harry told Luna, pulling out the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it over both of them. He gave the wall a little push.\\n\\n It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside. Harry glanced back and saw that it had resealed itself at once. They were standing in a dark corridor. Harry pulled Luna back into the shadows, fumbled in the pouch around his neck, and took out the Marauder\u0027s Map. Holding it close to his nose he searched, and located his and Luna\u0027s dots at last.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re up on the fifth floor,\" he whispered, watching filch moving away from them, a corridor ahead. \"Come on, this way.\"\\n\\n They crept off.\\n\\n Harry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never had his heart hammered that fast, never had so much depended on his safe passage through the place. Through squares of moonlight upon the floor, past suits of armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft footsteps, around corners beyond which who knew what lurked. Harry and Luna walked, checking the Marauder\u0027s Map whenever light permitted, twice pausing to allow a ghost to pass without drawing attention to themselves. He expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst fear was Peeves, and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first, telltale signs of the poltergeist\u0027s approach.\\n\\n \"The way, Harry,\" breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him toward a spiral staircase.\\n\\n They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here before. At last they reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole: nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, and a bronze knocker in the shape an eagle.\\n\\n Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in midair, unconnected to arm or body. She knocked once, and in the silence it sounded to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the beak of the eagle opened, but instead of a bird\u0027s called, a soft, musical voice said, \"Which came first, the phoenix or the flame?\"\\n\\n \"Hmm ... What do you think, Harry?\" said Luna, looking thoughtful.\\n\\n \"What? Isn\u0027t there a password?\"\\n\\n \"Oh no, you\u0027ve got to answer a question,\" said Luna.\\n\\n \"What if you get it wrong?\"\\n\\n \"Well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right,\" said Luna. \"That way you learn, you see?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah ... Trouble is, we can\u0027t really afford to wait for anyone else, Luna.\"\\n\\n \"No, I see what you mean,\" said Luna seriously. \"Well then, I think the answer is that a circle has no beginning.\"\\n\\n \"Well reasoned,\" said the voice, and the door swung open.\\n\\n The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular room, airier than any Harry had ever seen at Hogwarts. Graceful arched windows punctuated the walls, which were hung with blue-and-bronze silks. By day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular view of the surrounding mountains. The ceiling was domed and painted with stars, which were echoed in the midnight-blue carpet. There were tables, chairs, and bookcases, and in a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue of white marble.\\n\\n Harry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at Luna\u0027s house. The statue stood beside a door that led, he guessed, to dormitories above. He strode right up to the marble woman, and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her face, beautiful yet slightly intimidating. A delicate-looking circlet had been reproduced in marble on top of her head. It was not unlike the tiara Fleur had worn at her wedding. There were tiny words etched into it. Harry stepped out from under the Cloak and climbed up onto Ravenclaw\u0027s plinth to read them.\\n\\n \"\u0027Wit beyond measure is man\u0027s greatest treasure.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Which makes you pretty skint, witless,\" said a cackling voice.\\n\\n Harry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the floor. The sloping-shouldered figure of Alecto Carrow was standing before him, and even as Harry raised his wand, she pressed a stubby forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-harry-potter-7/page-29.html","bookId":1567,"book":{"id":1567,"title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter #7)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \\n (Harry Potter #7) \\n Readers beware. The brilliant, breathtaking conclusion to J.K. Rowling\u0027s spellbinding series is not for the faint of heart--such revelations, battles, and betrayals await in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows that no fan will make it to the end unscathed. Luckily, Rowling has prepped loyal readers for the end of her series by doling out increasingly dark and dangerous tales of magic and mystery, shot through with lessons about honor and contempt, love and loss, and right and wrong. Fear not, you will find no spoilers in our review--to tell the plot would ruin the journey, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is an odyssey the likes of which Rowling\u0027s fans have not yet seen, and are not likely to forget. But we would be remiss if we did not offer one small suggestion before you embark on your final adventure with Harry--bring plenty of tissues. \\n The heart of Book 7 is a hero\u0027s mission--not just in Harry\u0027s quest for the Horcruxes, but in his journey from boy to man--and Harry faces more danger than that found in all six books combined, from the direct threat of the Death Eaters and you-know-who, to the subtle perils of losing faith in himself. Attentive readers would do well to remember Dumbledore\u0027s warning about making the choice between \"what is right and what is easy,\" and know that Rowling applies the same difficult principle to the conclusion of her series. While fans will find the answers to hotly speculated questions about Dumbledore, Snape, and you-know-who, it is a testament to Rowling\u0027s skill as a storyteller that even the most astute and careful reader will be taken by surprise. \\n A spectacular finish to a phenomenal series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a bittersweet read for fans. The journey is hard, filled with events both tragic and triumphant, the battlefield littered with the bodies of the dearest and despised, but the final chapter is as brilliant and blinding as a phoenix\u0027s flame, and fans and skeptics alike will emerge from the confines of the story with full but heavy hearts, giddy and grateful for the experience.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-harry-potter-7.jpg","author":"J.K.
