{"id":109810,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"He was walking along a mountain road in the cool blue light of dawn. Far below, swathed in mist, was the shadow of a small town. Was the man he sought down there, the man he needed so badly he could think of little else, the man who held the answer, the answer to his problem...?\n \"Oi, wake up.\"\n Harry opened his eyes. He was lying again on the camp bed in Ron\u0027s dingy attic room. The sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy. Pigwidgeon was asleep with his head under his tiny wing. The scar on Harry\u0027s forehead was prickling.\n \"You were muttering in your sleep.\"\n \"Was I?\"\n \"Yeah. \u0027Gregorovitch.\u0027 You kept saying \u0027Gregorovitch.\u0027\"\n Harry was not wearing his glasses; Ron\u0027s face appeared slightly blurred.\n \"Who\u0027s Gregorovitch?\"\n \"I dunno, do I? You were the one saying it.\"\n Harry rubbed his forehead, thinking. He had a vague idea he had heard the name before, but he could not think where.\n \"I think Voldemort\u0027s looking for him.\"\n \"Poor bloke,\" said Ron fervently.\n Harry sat up, still rubbing his scar, now wide awake. He tried to remember exactly what he had seen in the dream, but all that came back was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little village cradled in a deep valley.\n \"I think he\u0027s abroad.\"\n \"Who, Gregorovitch?\"\n \"Voldemort. I think he\u0027s somewhere abroad, looking for Gregorovitch. It didn\u0027t look like anywhere in Britain.\"\n \"You reckon you were seeing into his mind again?\"\n Ron sounded worried.\n \"Do me a favor and don\u0027t tell Hermione,\" said Harry. \"Although how she expects me to stop seeing stuff in my sleep...\"\n He gazed up at little Pigwidgeon\u0027s cage, thinking...Why was the name \"Gregorovitch\" familiar?\n \"I think,\" he said slowly, \"he\u0027s got something to do with Quidditch. There\u0027s some connection, but I can\u0027t¨CI can\u0027t think what it is.\"\n \"Quidditch?\" said Ron. \"Sure you\u0027re not thinking of Gorgovitch?\"\n \"Who?\"\n \"Dragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the Chudley Cannons for a record fee two years ago. Record holder for most Quaffle drops in a season.\"\n \"No,\" said Harry. \"I\u0027m definitely not thinking of Gorgovitch.\"\n \"I try not to either,\" said Ron. \"Well, happy birthday anyway.\"\n \"Wow ¨C that\u0027s right, I forgot! I\u0027m seventeen!\"\n Harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed, pointed it at the cluttered desk where he had left his glasses, and said, \"Accio Glasses!\" Although they were only around a foot away, there was something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him, at least until they poked him in the eye.\n \"Slick,\" snorted Ron.\n Reveling in the removal of his Trace, Harry sent Ron\u0027s possessions flying around the room, causing Pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage. Harry also tried tying the laces of his trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand) and, purely for the pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on Ron\u0027s Chudley Cannons posters bright blue.\n \"I\u0027d do your fly by hand, though,\" Ron advised Harry, sniggering when Harry immediately checked it. \"Here\u0027s your present. Unwrap it up here, it\u0027s not for my mother\u0027s eyes.\"\n \"A book?\" said Harry as he took the rectangular parcel. \"Bit of a departure from tradition, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"This isn\u0027t your average book,\" said Ron. \"It\u0027d pure gold: Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches. Explains everything you need to know about girls. If only I\u0027d had this last year I\u0027d have known exactly how to get rid of Lavender and I would\u0027ve known how to get going with... Well, Fred and George gave me a copy, and I\u0027ve learned a lot. You\u0027d be surprised, it\u0027s not all about wandwork, either.\"\n When they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table. Bill and Monsieur Delacour were finishing their breakfasts, while Mrs. Weasley stood chatting to them over the frying pan.\n \"Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry,\" said Mrs. Weasley, beaming at him. \"He had to leave early for work, but he\u0027ll be back for dinner. That\u0027s our present on top.\"\n Harry sat down, took the square parcel she had indicated, and unwrapped it. Inside was a watch very like the one Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had given Ron for his seventeenth; it was gold, with stars circling around the race instead of hands.\n \"It\u0027s traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age,\" said Mrs. Weasley, watching him anxiously from beside the cooker. \"I\u0027m afraid that one isn\u0027t new like Ron\u0027s, it was actually my brother Fabian\u0027s and he wasn\u0027t terribly careful with his possessions, it\u0027s a bit dented on the back, but¨C\"\n The rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged her. He tried to put a lot of unsaid things into the hug and perhaps she understood them, because she patted his cheek clumsily when he released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way, causing half a pack of bacon to flop out of the frying pan onto the floor.\n \"Happy birthday, Harry!\" said Hermione, hurrying into the kitchen and adding her own present to the top of the pile. \"It\u0027s not much, but I hope you like it. What did you get him?\" she added to Ron, who seemed not to hear her.\n \"Come on, then, open Hermione\u0027s!\" said Ron.\n She had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other packages contained an enchanted razor from Bill and Fleur (\"Ah yes, zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will ever \u0027ave,\" Monsieur Delacour assured him, \"but you must tell it clearly what you want...ozzerwise you might find you \u0027ave a leetle less hair zan you would like...\"), chocolates from the Delacours, and an enormous box of the latest Weasleys\u0027 Wizard Wheezes merchandise from Fred and George.\n Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the arrival of Madame Delacour, Fleur, and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded.\n \"I\u0027ll pack these for you,\" Hermione said brightly, taking Harry\u0027s presents out of his arms as the three of them headed back upstairs. \"I\u0027m nearly done, I\u0027m just waiting for the rest of your underpants to come out of the wash, Ron¨C\"\n Ron\u0027s splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor landing.\n \"Harry, will you come in here a moment?\"\n It was Ginny. Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took him by the elbow and tugged him on up the stairs. Feeling nervous, Harry followed Ginny into her room.\n He had never been inside it before. It was small, but bright. There was a large poster of the Wizarding band the Weird Sisters on one wall, and a picture of Gwenog Jones, Captain of the all-witch Quidditch team the Holyhead Harpies, on the other. A desk stood facing the open window, which looked out over the orchard where he and Ginny had once played a two-a-side Quidditch with Ron and Hermione, and which now housed a large, pearly white marquee. The golden flag on top was level with Ginny\u0027s window.\n Ginny looked up into Harry\u0027s face, took a deep breath, and said, \"Happy seventeenth.\"\n \"Yeah...thanks.\"\n She was looking at him steadily; he however, found it difficult to look back at her; it was like gazing into a brilliant light.\n \"Nice view,\" he said feebly, pointing toward with window.\n She ignored this. He could not blame her.\n \"I couldn\u0027t think what to get you,\" she said.\n \"You didn\u0027t have to get me anything.\"\n She disregarded this too.\n \"I didn\u0027t know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you wouldn\u0027t be able to take it with you.\"\n He chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that was one of the many wonderful things about Ginny, she was rarely weepy. He had sometimes thought that having six brothers must have toughened her up.\n She took a step closer to him.\n \"So then I thought, I\u0027d like you to have something to remember me by, you know, if you meet some veela when you\u0027re off doing whatever you\u0027re doing.\"\n \"I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be honest.\"\n \"There\u0027s the silver lining I\u0027ve been looking for,\" she whispered, and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before, and Harry was kissing her back, and it was blissful oblivion better than firewhisky; she was the only real thing in the world, Ginny, the feel of her, one hand at her back and one in her long, sweet-smelling hair¨C The door banged open behind them and they jumped apart.\n \"Oh,\" said Ron pointedly. \"Sorry.\"\n \"Ron!\" Hermione was just behind him, slight out of breath. There was a strained silence, then Ginny had said in a flat little voice, \"Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry.\"\n Ron\u0027s ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry wanted to slam the door in their faces, but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door opened, and his shining moment had popped like a soap bubble. All the reasons for ending his relationship with Ginny, for staying well away from her, seemed to have slunk inside the room with Ron, and all happy forgetfulness was gone.\n He looked at Ginny, wanting to say something, though he hardly knew what, but she had turned her back on him. He thought that she might have succumbed, for once, to tears. He could not do anything to comfort her in front of Ron.\n \"I\u0027ll see you later,\" he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom.\n Ron marched downstairs, though the still-crowded kitchen and into the yard, and Harry kept pace with him all the way, Hermione trotting along behind them looking scared.\n Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, Ron rounded on Harry.\n \"You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around?\"\n \"I\u0027m not messing her around,\" said Harry, as Hermione caught up with them.\n \"Ron¨C\"\n But Ron held up a hand to silence her.\n \"She was really cut up when you ended it¨C\"\n \"So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn\u0027t because I wanted to.\"\n \"Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she\u0027s just going to get her hopes up again¨C\"\n \"She\u0027s not an idiot, she knows it can\u0027t happen, she\u0027s not expecting us to¨Cto end up married, or¨C\"\n As he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry\u0027s mind of Ginny in a white dress, marrying a tall, faceless, and unpleasant stranger.\n In one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him: Her future was free and unencumbered, whereas his...he could see nothing but Voldemort ahead.\n \"If you keep groping her every chance you get¨C\"\n \"It won\u0027t happen again,\" said Harry harshly. The day was cloudless, but he felt as though the sun had gone in. \"Okay?\"\n Ron looked half resentful, half sheepish; he rocked backward and forward on his feet for a moment, then said, \"Right then, well, that\u0027s...yeah.\"\n Ginny did not seek another one-to-one meeting with Harry for the rest of the day, nor by any look or gesture did she show that they had shared more than polite conversation in her room. Nevertheless, Charlie\u0027s arrival came as a relief to Harry. It provided a distraction, watching Mrs. Weasley force Charlie into a chair, raise her wand threateningly, and announce that he was about to get a proper haircut.\n As Harry\u0027s birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow\u0027s kitchen to breaking point even before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and Hagrid, several tables were placed end to end in the garden. Fred and George bewitched a number of purple lanterns all emblazoned with a large number 17, to hang in midair over the guests. Thanks to Mrs. Weasley\u0027s ministrations, George\u0027s wound was neat and clean, but Harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of his head, despite the twins\u0027 many jokes about it.\n Hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and drape themselves artistically over the trees and bushes.\n \"Nice,\" said Ron, as with one final flourish of her wand, Hermione turned the leaves on the crabapple tree to gold. \"You\u0027ve really got an eye for that sort of thing.\"\n \"Thank you, Ron!\" said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little confused. Harry turned away, smiling to himself. He had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments when he found time to peruse his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches; he caught Ginny\u0027s eye and grinned at her before remembering his promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a conversation with Monsieur Delacour.\n \"Out of the way, out of the way!\" sang Mrs. Weasley, coming through the gate with what appeared to be a giant, beach-ball-sized Snitch floating in front of her. Seconds later Harry realized that it was his birthday cake, which Mrs. Weasley was suspending with her wand, rather than risk carrying it over the uneven ground. When the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table, Harry said, \"That looks amazing, Mrs. Weasley.\"\n \"Oh, it\u0027s nothing, dear,\" she said fondly. Over her shoulder, Ron gave Harry the thumbs-up and mouthed, Good one.\n By seven o\u0027clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred and George, who had waited for them at the end of the lane. Hagrid had honored the occasion by wearing his best, and horrible, hairy brown suit. Although Lupin smiled as he shook Harry\u0027s hand, Harry thought he looked rather unhappy. It was all very odd; Tonks, beside him, looked simply radiant.\n \"Happy birthday, Harry,\" she said, hugging him tightly.\n \"Seventeen, eh!\" said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket-sized glass of wine from Fred. \"Six years ter the day since we met, Harry, d\u0027yeh remember it?\"\n \"Vaguely,\" said Harry, grinning up at him. \"Didn\u0027t you smash down the front door, give Dudley a pig\u0027s tail, and tell me I was a wizard?\"\n \"I forge\u0027 the details,\" Hagrid chortled. \"All righ\u0027, Ron, Hermione?\"\n \"We\u0027re fine,\" said Hermione. \"How are you?\"\n \"Ar, not bad. Bin busy, we got some newborn unicorns. I\u0027ll show yeh when yeh get back¨C\" Harry avoided Ron\u0027s and Hermione\u0027s gazes as Hagrid rummaged in his pocket. \"Here. Harry ¨C couldn\u0027t think what ter get teh, but then I remembered this.\" He pulled out a small, slightly furry drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn around the neck. \"Mokeskin. Hide anythin\u0027 in there an\u0027 no one but the owner can get it out. They\u0027re rare, them.\"\n \"Hagrid, thanks!\"\n \"\u0027S\u0027nothin\u0027,\" said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid-sized hand. \"An\u0027 there\u0027s Charlie! Always liked him ¨C hey! Charlie!\"\n Charlie approached, running his hand slightly ruefully over his new, brutally short haircut. He was shorter than Ron, thickset, with a number of burns and scratches up his muscled arms.\n \"Hi, Hagrid, how\u0027s it going?\"\n \"Bin meanin\u0027 ter write fer ages. How\u0027s Norbert doin\u0027?\"\n \"Norbert?\" Charlie laughed. \"The Norwegian Ridgeback? We call her Norberta now.\"\n \"Wha ¨C Norbert\u0027s a girl?\"\n \"Oh yeah,\" said Charlie.\n \"How can you tell?\" asked Hermione.\n \"They\u0027re a lot more vicious,\" said Charlie. He looked over his shoulder and dropped his voice. \"Wish Dad would hurry up and get here. Mum\u0027s getting edgy.\"\n They all looked over at Mrs. Weasley. She was trying to talk to Madame Delacour while glancing repeatedly at the gate.\n \"I think we\u0027d better start without Arthur,\" she called to the garden at large after a moment or two. \"He must have been held up at ¨C oh!\"\n They all saw it at the same time: a streak of light that came flying across the yard and onto the table, where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel, which stood on its hind legs and spoke with Mr. Weasley\u0027s voice.\n \"Minister of Magic coming with me.\"\n The Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur\u0027s family peering in astonishment at the place where it had vanished.\n \"We shouldn\u0027t be here,\" said Lupin at once. \"Harry ¨C I\u0027m sorry ¨C I\u0027ll explain some other time¨C\"\n He seized Tonks\u0027s wrist and pulled her away; they reached the fence, climbed over it, and vanished from sight. Mrs. Weasley looked bewildered.\n \"The Minister ¨C but why¨C? I don\u0027t understand¨C\"\n But there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr. Weasley had appeared out of thin air at the gate, accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour, instantly recognizable by his mane of grizzled hair.\n The two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the lantern-lit table, where everybody sat in silence, watching them draw closer. As Scrimgeour came within range of the lantern light. Harry saw that he looked much older than the last time that had met, scraggy and grim.\n \"Sorry to intrude,\" said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt before the table. \"Especially as I can see that I am gate-crashing a party.\"\n His eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake.\n \"Many happy returns.\"\n \"Thanks,\" said Harry.\n \"I require a private word with you,\" Scrimgeour went on. \"Also with Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger.\"\n \"Us?\" said Ron, sounding surprised. \"Why us?\"\n \"I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private,\" said Scrimgeour. \"Is there such a place?\" he demanded of Mr. Weasley.\n \"Yes, of course,\" said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. \"The, er, sitting room, why don\u0027t you use that?\"\n \"You can lead the way,\" Scrimgeour said to Ron. \"There will be no need for you to accompany us, Arthur.\"\n Harry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as he, Ron, and Hermione stood up. As they led the way back to the house in silence, Harry knew that the other two were thinking the same as he was; Scrimgeour must, somehow, had learned that the three of them were planning to drop out of Hogwarts.\n Scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messed kitchen and into the Burrow\u0027s sitting room. Although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light, it was already dark in here; Harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated the shabby but cozy room. Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that Mr. Weasley normally occupied, leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa. Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke.\n \"I have some questions for the three of you, and I think it will be best if we do it individually. If you two\" ¨C he pointed at Harry and Hermione ¨C \"can wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald.\"\n \"We\u0027re not going anywhere,\" said Harry, while Hermione nodded vigorously. \"You can speak to us together, or not at all.\"\n Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had the impression that the Minister was wondering whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early.\n \"Very well then, together,\" he said, shrugging. He cleared his throat. \"I am here, as I\u0027m sure you know, because of Albus Dumbledore\u0027s will.\"\n Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another.\n \"A surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that Dumbledore had left you anything?\"\n \"A-all of us?\" said Ron, \"Me and Hermione too?\"\n \"Yes, all of ¨C\"\n But Harry interrupted.\n \"Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give us what he left us?\"\n \"Isn\u0027t it obvious?\" said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer. \"They wanted to examine whatever he\u0027s left us. You had no right to do that!\" she said, and her voice trembled slightly.\n \"I had every right,\" said Scrimgeour dismissively. \"The Decree for Justifiable Confiscation gives the Ministry the power the confiscate the contents of a will¨C\"\n \"That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts,\" said Hermione, \"and the Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased\u0027s possessions are illegal before seizing them! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was trying to pass us something cursed?\"\n \"Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?\" asked Scrimgeour.\n \"No, I\u0027m not,\" retorted Hermione. \"I\u0027m hoping to do some good in the world!\"\n Ron laughed. Scrimgeour\u0027s eyes flickered toward him and away again as Harry spoke.\n \"So why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can\u0027t think of a pretext to keep them?\"\n \"No, it\u0027ll be because thirty-one days are up,\" said Hermione at once. \"They can\u0027t keep the objects longer than that unless they can prove they\u0027re dangerous. Right?\"\n \"Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?\" asked Scrimgeour, ignoring Hermione. Ron looked startled.\n \"Me? Not ¨C not really... It was always Harry who...\"\n Ron looked around at Harry and Hermione, to see Hermione giving him a stop-talking-now! sort of look, but the damage was done; Scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected, and wanted, to hear. He swooped like a bird of prey upon Ron\u0027s answer.\n \"If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the fact that he remembered you in his will? He made exceptionally few personal bequests. The vast majority of his possessions ¨C his private library, his magical instruments, and other personal effects ¨C were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out?\"\n \"I...dunno,\" said Ron. \"I...when I say we weren\u0027t close...I mean, I think he liked me...\"\n \"You\u0027re being modest, Ron,\" said Hermione. \"Dumbledore was very fond of you.\"\n This was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Harry knew, Ron and Dumbledore had never been alone together, and direct contact between them had been negligible. However, Scrimgeour did not seem to be listening. He put his hand inside his cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry. From it, he removed a scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud.\n \"\u0027The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore\u0027... Yes, here we are... \u0027To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, in the hope that he will remember me when he uses it.\u0027\"\n Scrimgeour took from the bag an object that Harry had seen before: It looked something like a silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the power to suck all light from a place, and restore it, with a simple click. Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the Deluminator to Ron, who took it and turned it over in the fingers looking stunned.\n \"That is a valuable object,\" said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. \"It may even be unique. Certainly it is of Dumbledore\u0027s own design. Why would he have left you and item so rare?\"\n Ron shook his head, looking bewildered.\n \"Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students,\" Scrimgeour persevered. \"Yet the only ones he remembered in his will are you three. Why is that? To what use did he think you would put to the Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?\"\n \"Put out lights, I s\u0027pose,\" mumbled Ron. \"What else could I do with it?\"\n Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron for a moment or tow, he turned back to Dumbledore\u0027s will.\n \"\u0027To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.\u0027\"\n Scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of Secrets of the Darkest Art upstairs. Its binding was stained and peeling in places. Hermione took it from Scrimgeour without a word. She held the book in her lap and gazed at it. Harry saw that the title was in runes; he had never learned to read them. As he looked, a tear splashed onto the embossed symbols.\n \"Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss Granger?\" asked Scrimgeour.\n \"He... he knew I liked books,\" said Hermione in a thick voice, mopping her eyes with her sleeve.\n \"But why that particular book?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. He must have thought I\u0027d enjoy it.\"\n \"Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret messages, with Dumbledore?\"\n \"No, I didn\u0027t,\" said Hermione, still wiping her eyes on her sleeve. \"And if the Ministry hasn\u0027t found any hidden codes in this book in thirty-one days, I doubt that I will.\"\n She suppressed a sob. They were wedged together so tightly that Ron had difficulty extracting his arm to put it around Hermione\u0027s shoulders. Scrimgeour turned back to the will.\n \"\u0027To Harry James Potter,\u0027\" he read, and Harry\u0027s insides contracted with a sudden excitement, \"\u0027I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.\u0027\"\n As Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized golden ball, its silver wings fluttered rather feebly, and Harry could not help feeling a definite sense of anticlimax.\n \"Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?\" asked Scrimgeour.\n \"No idea,\" said Harry. \"For the reasons you just read out, I suppose... to remind me what you can get if you... persevere and whatever it was.\"\n \"You think this a mere symbolic keepsake, then?\"\n \"I suppose so,\" said Harry. \"What else could it be?\"\n \"I\u0027m asking the questions,\" said Scrimgeour, shifting his chair a little closer to the sofa. Dusk was really falling outside now; the marquee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the hedge.\n \"I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch,\" Scrimgeour said to Harry. \"Why is that?\"\n Hermione laughed derisively.\n \"Oh, it can\u0027t be a reference to the fact Harry\u0027s a great Seeker, that\u0027s way too obvious,\" she said. \"There must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the icing!\"\n \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything hidden in the icing,\" said Scrimgeour, \"but a Snitch would be a very good hiding place for a small object. You know why, I\u0027m sure?\"\n Harry shrugged, Hermione, however, answered: Harry thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could not suppress the urge.\n \"Because Snitches have flesh memories,\" she said.\n \"What?\" said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermione\u0027s Quidditch knowledge negligible.\n \"Correct,\" said Scrimgeour. \"A Snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is released, not even by the maker, who wears gloves. It carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it, in case of a disputed capture. This Snitch\" ¨C he held up the tiny golden ball ¨C \"will remember your touch, Potter.\n It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical skill, whatever his other faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you.\"\n Harry\u0027s heart was beating rather fast. He was sure that Scrimgeour was right. How could he avoid taking the Snitch with his bare hand in front of the Minister?\n \"You don\u0027t say anything,\" said Scrimgeour. \"Perhaps you already know what the Snitch contains?\"\n \"No,\" said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch the Snitch without really doing so. If only he knew Legilimency, really knew it, and could read Hermione\u0027s mind; he could practically hear her brain whizzing beside him.\n \"Take it,\" said Scrimgeour quietly.\n Harry met the Minister\u0027s yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey. He held out his hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward again and place the Snitch, slowly and deliberately, into Harry\u0027s palm.\n Nothing happened. As Harry\u0027s fingers closed around the Snitch, its tired wings fluttered and were still. Scrimgeour, Ron, and Hermione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed ball, as if still hoping it might transform in some way.\n \"That was dramatic,\" said Harry coolly. Both Ron and Hermione laughed.\n \"That\u0027s all, then, is it?\" asked Hermione, making to raise herself off the sofa.\n \"Not quite,\" said Scrimgeour, who looked bad tempered now. \"Dumbledore left you a second bequest, Potter.\"\n \"What is it?\" asked Harry, excitement rekindling.\n Scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time.\n \"The sword of Godric Gryffindor,\" he said. Hermione and Ron both stiffened. Harry looked around for a sign of the ruby-encrusted hilt, but Scrimgeour did not pull the sword from the leather pouch, which in any case looked much too small to contain it.\n \"So where is it?\" Harry asked suspiciously.\n \"Unfortunately,\" said Scrimgeour, \"that sword was not Dumbledore\u0027s to give away. The sword of Godric Gryffindor is an important historical artifact, and as such, belongs¨C\"\n \"It belongs to Harry!\" said Hermione hotly. \"It chose him, he was the one who found it, it came to him out of the Sorting Hat¨C\"\n \"According to reliable historical sources, the sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor,\" said Scrimgeour. \"That does not make it the exclusive property of Mr. Potter, whatever Dumbledore may have decided.\" Scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek, scrutinizing Harry. \"Why do you think¨C?\"\n \"¨CDumbledore wanted to give me the sword?\" said Harry, struggling to keep his temper. \"Maybe he thought it would look nice on my wall.\"\n \"This is not a joke, Potter!\" growled Scrimgeour. \"Was it because Dumbledore believed that only the sword of Godric Gryffindor could defeat the Heir of Slytherin? Did he wish to give you that sword, Potter, because he believed, as do many, that you are the one destined to destroy He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?\"\n \"Interesting theory,\" said Harry. \"Has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in Voldemort? Maybe the Ministry should put some people onto that, instead of wasting their time stripping down Deluminators or covering up breakouts from Azkaban. So this is what you\u0027ve been doing, Minister, shut up in your office, trying to break open a Snitch? People are dying ¨C I was nearly one of them ¨C Voldemort chased me across three countries, he killed Mad-Eye Moody, but there\u0027s no word about any of that from the Ministry, has there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you!\"\n \"You go too far!\" shouted Scrimgeour, standing up: Harry jumped to his feet too. Scrimgeour limped toward Harry and jabbed him hard in the chest with the point of his wand; It singed a hole in Harry\u0027s T-shirt like a lit cigarette.\n \"Oi!\" said Ron, jumping up and raising his own wand, but Harry said, \"No! D\u0027you want to give him an excuse to arrest us?\"\n \"Remembered you\u0027re not at school, have you?\" said Scrimgeour breathing hard into Harry\u0027s face. \"Remembered that I am not Dumbledore, who forgave your insolence and insubordination? You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a seventeen-year-old boy to tell me how to do my job! It\u0027s time you learned some respect!\"\n \"It\u0027s time you earned it.\" said Harry.\n The floor trembled; there was a sound of running footsteps, then the door to the sitting room burst open and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley ran in.\n \"We ¨C we thought we heard ¨C\" began Mr. Weasley, looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of Harry and the Minister virtually nose to nose.\n \" ¨C raised voices,\" panted Mrs. Weasley.\n Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, glancing at the hole he had made in Harry\u0027s T-shirt. He seemed to regret his loss of temper.\n \"It ¨C it was nothing,\" he growled. \"I ... regret your attitude,\" he said, looking Harry full in the face once more. \"You seem to think that the Ministry does not desire what you ¨C what Dumbledore ¨C desired. We ought to work together.\"\n \"I don\u0027t like your methods, Minister,\" said Harry. \"Remember?\"\n For the second time, he raised his right fist and displayed to Scrimgeour the scar that still showed white on the back of it, spelling I must not tell lies . Scrimgeour\u0027s expression hardened. He turned away without another word and limped from the room. Mrs. Weasley hurried after him; Harry heard her stop at the back door. After a minute or so she called, \"He\u0027s gone!\"\n \"What did he want?\" Mr. Weasley asked, looking around at Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Mrs. Weasley came hurrying back to them.\n \"To give us what Dumbledore left us,\" said Harry. \"They\u0027ve only just released the content of his will.\"\n Outside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects Scrimgeour had given them were passed from hand to hand. Everyone exclaimed over the Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle the Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword, but none of them could offer any suggestion as to why Dumbledore would have left Harry an old Snitch. As Mr. Weasley examined the Deluminator for the third of fourth time, Mrs. Weasley said tentatively, \"Harry, dear, everyone\u0027s awfully hungry we didn\u0027t like to start without you... Shall I serve dinner now?\"\n They all ate rather hurriedly and then after a hasty chorus of \"Happy Birthday\" and much gulping of cake, the party broke up. Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding the following day, but was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set up a tent for himself in a neighboring field.\n \"Meet us upstairs,\" Harry whispered to Hermione, while they helped Mrs. Weasley restore the garden to its normal state. \"After everyone\u0027s gone to bed.\"\n Up in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry filled Hagrid\u0027s moleskin purse, not with gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently worthless though some of them were the Marauder\u0027s Map, the shard of Sirius\u0027s enchanted mirror, and R.A.B.\u0027s locket. He pulled the string tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then sat holding the old Snitch and watching its wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped on the door and tiptoed inside.\n \"Muffiato,\" she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of the stairs.\n \"Thought you didn\u0027t approve of that spell?\" said Ron.\n \"Times change,\" said Hermione. \"Now, show us that Deluminator.\"\n Ron obliged at once. Holding I up in front of him, he clicked it. The solitary lamp they had lit went out at once.\n \"The thing is,\" whispered Hermione through the dark, \"we could have achieved that with Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder.\"\n There was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the ceiling and illuminated them all once more.\n \"Still, it\u0027s cool,\" said Ron, a little defensively. \"And from what they said, Dumbledore invented it himself!\"\n \"I know but, surely he wouldn\u0027t have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the lights!\"\n \"D\u0027you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything he\u0027d left us?\" asked Harry.\n \"Definitely,\" said Hermione. \"He couldn\u0027t tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things, but that will doesn\u0027t explain...\"\n \"... why he couldn\u0027t have given us a hint when he was alive?\" asked Ron.\n \"Well, exactly,\" said Hermione, now flicking through The Tales of Beedle the Bard. \"If these things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the Ministry, you\u0027d think he\u0027d have left us know why... unless he thought it was obvious?\"\n \"Thought wrong, then, didn\u0027t he?\" said Ron. \"I always said he was mental. Brilliant and everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry an old Snitch ¨C what the hell was that about?\"\n \"I\u0027ve no idea,\" said Hermione. \"When Scrimgeour made you take it, Harry, I was so sure that something was going to happen!\"\n \"Yeah, well,\" said Harry, his pulse quickened as he raised the Snitch in his fingers. \"I wasn\u0027t going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour was I?\"\n \"What do you mean?\" asked Hermione.\n \"The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match?\" said Harry. \"Don\u0027t you remember?\"\n Hermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped, pointing frantically from Harry to the Snitch and back again until he found his voice.\n \"That was the one you nearly swallowed!\"\n \"Exactly,\" said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, he pressed his mouth to the Snitch.\n It did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him: He lowered the golden sphere, but then Hermione cried out.\n \"Writing! There\u0027s writing on it, quick, look!\" He nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and excitement. Hermione was quite right. Engraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds before there had been nothing, were five words written in the thin, slanted handwriting that Harry recognized as Dumbledore\u0027s\n I open at the close.\n He had barely read them when the words vanished again.\n \"I open at the close.... What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\"\n Hermione and Ron shook their heads, looking blank.\n \"I open at the close... at the close... I open at the close...\"\n But no matter how often they repeated the words, with many different inflections, they were unable to wring any more meaning from them.\n \"And the sword,\" said Ron finally, when they had at last abandoned their attempts to divine meaning in the Snitch\u0027s inscription.\n \"Why did he want Harry to have the sword?\"\n \"And why couldn\u0027t he just have told me?\" Harry said quietly. \"I was there, it was right there on the wall of his office during all our talks last year! If he wanted me to have it, why didn\u0027t he just give it to me then?\"\n He felt as thought he were sitting in an examination with a question he ought to have been able to answer in front of him, his brain slow and unresponsive. Was there something he had missed in the long talks with Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know what it all meant? Had Dumbledore expected him to understand?\n \"And as for this book.\" Said Hermione, \"The Tales of Beedle the Bard ... I\u0027ve never even heard of them!\"\n \"You\u0027ve never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?\" said Ron incredulously. \"You\u0027re kidding, right?\"\n \"No, I\u0027m not,\" said Hermione in surprise. \"Do you know them then?\"\n \"Well, of course I do!\"\n Harry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron having read a book that Hermione had not was unprecedented. Ron, however, looked bemused by their surprise.\n \"Oh come on! All the old kids\u0027 stories are supposed to be Beedle\u0027s aren\u0027t they? \u0027The Fountain of Fair Fortune\u0027 ... \u0027The Wizard and the Hopping Pot\u0027... \u0027Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling Stump\u0027...\"\n \"Excuse me?\" said Hermione giggling. \"What was the last one?\"\n \"Come off it!\" said Ron, looking in disbelief from Harry to Hermione. \"You must\u0027ve heard of Babbitty Rabbitty ¨C \"\n \"Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles!\" said Hermione. \"We didn\u0027t hear stories like that when we were little, we heard \u0027Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\u0027 and \u0027Cinderella\u0027 ¨C \"\n \"What\u0027s that, an illness?\" asked Ron.\n \"So these are children\u0027s stories?\" asked Hermione, bending against over the runes.\n \"Yeah.\" Said Ron uncertainly. \"I mean, just what you hear, you know, that all these old stories came from Beedle. I dunno what they\u0027re like in the original versions.\"\n \"But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them?\"\n Something cracked downstairs.\n \"Probably just Charlie, now Mum\u0027s asleep, sneaking off to regrow his hair,\" said Ron nervously.\n \"All the same, we should get to bed,\" whispered Hermione. \"It wouldn\u0027t do to oversleep tomorrow.\"\n \"No,\" agreed Ron. \"A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom\u0027s mother might put a bit of damper on the wedding. I\u0027ll get the light.\"\n And he clicked the Deluminator once more as Hermione left the room. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-harry-potter-7/page-7.html","bookId":1567,"book":{"id":1567,"title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows \n (Harry Potter #7) \n Readers beware. The brilliant, breathtaking conclusion to J.K. Rowling\u0027s spellbinding series is not for the faint of heart--such revelations, battles, and betrayals await in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows that no fan will make it to the end unscathed. Luckily, Rowling has prepped loyal readers for the end of her series by doling out increasingly dark and dangerous tales of magic and mystery, shot through with lessons about honor and contempt, love and loss, and right and wrong. Fear not, you will find no spoilers in our review--to tell the plot would ruin the journey, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is an odyssey the likes of which Rowling\u0027s fans have not yet seen, and are not likely to forget. But we would be remiss if we did not offer one small suggestion before you embark on your final adventure with Harry--bring plenty of tissues. \n The heart of Book 7 is a hero\u0027s mission--not just in Harry\u0027s quest for the Horcruxes, but in his journey from boy to man--and Harry faces more danger than that found in all six books combined, from the direct threat of the Death Eaters and you-know-who, to the subtle perils of losing faith in himself. Attentive readers would do well to remember Dumbledore\u0027s warning about making the choice between \"what is right and what is easy,\" and know that Rowling applies the same difficult principle to the conclusion of her series. While fans will find the answers to hotly speculated questions about Dumbledore, Snape, and you-know-who, it is a testament to Rowling\u0027s skill as a storyteller that even the most astute and careful reader will be taken by surprise. \n A spectacular finish to a phenomenal series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a bittersweet read for fans. The journey is hard, filled with events both tragic and triumphant, the battlefield littered with the bodies of the dearest and despised, but the final chapter is as brilliant and blinding as a phoenix\u0027s flame, and fans and skeptics alike will emerge from the confines of the story with full but heavy hearts, giddy and grateful for the experience.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-harry-potter-7.jpg","author":"J.K.
