{"id":109826,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"Bill and Fleur\u0027s cottage stood alone on a cliff overlooking the sea, its walls embedded with shells and whitewashed. It was a lonely and beautiful place. Wherever Harry went inside the tiny cottage or its garden, he could hear the constant ebb and flow of the sea, like the breathing of some great, slumbering creature. He spent much of the next few days making excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea, and the feel of cold, salty wind on his face. The enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand still scared Harry. He could not remember, ever before, choosing /not/ to act. He was full of doubts, doubts that Ron could not help voicing whenever they were together. \"What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand?\" \"What if working out what the symbol meant made you \u0027worthy\u0027 to get the Hallows?\" \"Harry, if that really is the Elder Wand, how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know-Who?\" Harry had no answers: There were moments when he wondered whether it had been outright madness not to try to prevent Voldemort breaking open the tomb. He could not even explain satisfactorily why he had decided against it: Every time he tried to reconstruct the internal arguments that had led to his decision, they sounded feebler to him. The odd thing was that Hermione\u0027s support made him feel just as confused as Ron\u0027s doubts. Now forced to accept that the Elder Wand was real, she maintained that it was an evil object, and that the way Voldemort had taken possession of it was repellent, not to be considered. \"You could never have done that, Harry,\" she said again and again. \"You couldn\u0027t have broken into Dumbledore\u0027s grave.\" But the idea of Dumbledore\u0027s corpse frightened Harry much less than the possibility that he might have misunderstood the living Dumbledore\u0027s intentions. He felt that he was still groping in the dark; he had chosen his path but kept looking back, wondering whether he had misread the signs, whether he should not have taken the other way. From time to time, anger at Dumbledore crashed over him again, powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the cliff beneath the cottage, anger that Dumbledore had not explained before he died. \"But /is/ he dead?\" said Ron, three days after they had arrived at the cottage. Harry had been staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione had found him; he wished they had not, having no wish to join in with their argument. \"Yes, he is. Ron, please, don\u0027t start that again!\" \"Look at the facts, Hermione,\" said Ron, speaking across Harry, who continued to gaze at the horizon. \"The solve doe. The sword. The eye Harry saw in the mirror ¨C\" \"Harry admits he could have imagined the eye! Don\u0027t you, Harry?\" \"I could have,\" said Harry without looking at her. \"But you don\u0027t thing you did, do you?\" asked Ron. \"No, I don\u0027t,\" said Harry. \"There you go!\" said Ron quickly, before Hermione could carry on. \"If it wasn\u0027t Dumbledore, explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar, Hermione?\" \"I can\u0027t ¨C but can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us if he\u0027s lying in a tomb at Hogwarts?\" \"I dunno, it could\u0027ve been his ghost!\" \"Dumbledore wouldn\u0027t come back as a ghost,\" said Harry. There was little about Dumbledore he was sure of now, but he knew that much. \"He would have gone on.\" \"What d\u0027you mean, \u0027gone on\u0027?\" asked Ron, but before Harry could say any more, a voice behind them said, \"\u0027Arry?\" Fleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair flying in the breeze. \"\u0027Arry, Grip\u0027ook would like to speak to you. \u0027E eez in ze smallest bedroom, \u0027e says \u0027e does not want to be over\u0027eard.\" Her dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was clear; she looked irritable as she walked back around the house. Griphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in the tiniest of the cottage\u0027s three bedrooms, in which Hermione and Luna slept by night. He had drawn the red cotton curtains against the bright, cloudy sky, which gave the room a fiery glow at odds with the rest of the airy, light cottage. \"I have reached my decision, Harry Potter,\" said the goblin, who was sitting cross-legged in a low chair, drumming its arms with his spindly fingers. \"Though the goblins of Gringotts will consider it base treachery, I have decided to help you ¨C\" \"That\u0027s great!\" said Harry, relief surging through him. \"Griphook, thank you, we\u0027re really ¨C\" \"¨C in return,\" said the goblin firmly, \"for payment.\" Slightly taken aback, Harry hesitated. \"How much do you want? I\u0027ve got gold.\" \"Not gold,\" said Griphook. \"I have gold.\" His black eyes glittered; there were no whites to his eyes. \"I want the sword. The sword of Godric Gryffindor.\" Harry\u0027s spirits plummeted. \"You can\u0027t have that,\" he said. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" \"Then,\" said the goblin softly, \"we have a problem.\" \"We can give you something else,\" said Ron eagerly. \"I\u0027ll bet the Lestranges have got loads of stuff, you can take your pick once we get into the vault.\" He had said the wrong thing. Griphook flushed angrily. \"I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to which I have no right!\" \"The sword\u0027s ours ¨C\" \"it is not,\" said the goblin. \"We\u0027re Gryffindors, and it was Godric Gryffindor\u0027s ¨C\" \"And before it was Gryffindor\u0027s, whose was it?\" demanded the goblin, sitting up straight. \"No one\u0027s,\" said Ron. \"It was made for him, wasn\u0027t it?\" \"No!\" cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he pointed a long finger at Ron. \"Wizarding arrogance again! That sword was Ragnuk the First\u0027s, taken from him by Godric Gryffindor! It is a ¨C, a masterpiece of goblinwork! It belongs with the gobl¨C. The sword is the price of my hire, take it or leave it!\" Griphook glared at them. Harry glanced at the other ¨C, then said, \"We need to discuss this, Griphook, if that\u0027s all right. Could you give us a few minutes?\" The goblin nodded, looking sour. Downstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked to the fireplace, brow furrowed, trying to think what to do. Behind him, Ron said, \"He\u0027s having a laugh. We can\u0027t let him have that sword.\" \"It is true?\" Harry asked Hermione. \"Was the sword stolen by Gryffindor?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said hopelessly. \"Wizarding history often skates over what the wizards have done to other magical races, but there\u0027s no account that I know of that says Gryffindor stole the sword.\" \"It\u0027ll be one of those goblin stories,\" said Ron, \"about how the wizards are always trying to get one over on them. I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn\u0027t asked for one of our wands.\" \"Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron.\" said Hermione. \"They\u0027ve been treated brutally in the past.\" \"Goblins aren\u0027t exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, are they?\" said Ron. \"They\u0027ve killed plenty of us. They\u0027ve fought dirty too.\" \"But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhanded and violent isn\u0027t going to make him more likely to help us, is it?\" There was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the problem. Harry looked out of the window at Dobby\u0027s grave. Luna was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside the headstone. \"Okay,\" said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, \"how\u0027s this? We tell Griphook we need the sword until we get inside the ¨C and then he can have it. There\u0027s a fake in these, isn\u0027t there? We switch them, and give him the fake.\" \"Ron, he\u0027d know the difference better than we would!\" said Hermione. \"He\u0027s the only one who realized there had been a swap!\" \"Yeah, but we could ¨C caper before he realizes ¨C\" He quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him. \"That,\" she said quietly, \"is despicable. Ask for his help, then double-cross him? And you wonder why goblins don\u0027t like wizards, Ron?\" Ron\u0027s ears had turned red. \"All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of! What\u0027s your solution, then?\" \"We need to offer him something else, something just as valuable.\" \"Brilliant, I\u0027ll go and get one of our ancient goblin-made swords and you can gift wrap it.\" Silence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the sword, even if they had something as valuable to offer him. Yet the sword was their one, indispensable weapon against the Horcruxes. He closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the sea. The idea that Gryffindor might have stolen the sword was unpleasant to him: He had always been proud to be a Gryffindor; Gryffindor had been the champion of Muggle-borns, the wizard who had clashed with the pureblood-loving Slytherin.... \"Maybe he\u0027s lying,\" Harry said, opening his eyes again. \"Griphook. Maybe Gryffindor didn\u0027t take the sword. How do we know the goblin version of history\u0027s right?\" \"Does it make a difference?\" asked Hermione. \"Changes how I feel about it,\" said Harry. He took a deep breath. \"We\u0027ll tell him he can have the sword after he\u0027s helped us get into that vault ¨C but we\u0027ll be careful to avoid telling him exactly /when/ he can have it.\" A grin spread slowly across Ron\u0027s face. Hermione, however, looked alarmed. \"Harry, we can\u0027t ¨C\" \"He can have it,\" Harry went on, \"after we\u0027ve used it on all of the Horcruxes. I\u0027ll make sure he gets it then. I\u0027ll keep my word.\" \"But that could be years!\" said Hermione. \"I know that, but /he/ needn\u0027t. I won\u0027t be lying... really.\" Harry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame. He remembered the words that had been engraved over the gateway to Nurmengard: FOR THE GREATER GOOD. He pushed the idea away. What choice did they have? \"I don\u0027t like it,\" said Hermione. \"Nor do I, much,\" Harry admitted. \"Well, I think it\u0027s genius,\" said Ron, standing up again. \"Let\u0027s go and tell him.\" Back in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, careful to phrase it so as not to give any definite time for the handover of the sword. Hermione frowned at the floor while he was speaking; he felt irritated at her, afraid that she might give the game away. However, Griphook had eyes for nobody but Harry. \"I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help you?\" \"Yes,\" said Harry. \"Then shake,\" said the goblin, holding out his hand. Harry took it and shook. He wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in his own. Then Griphook relinquished him, clapped his hands together, and said, \"So. We begin!\" It was like planning to break into the Ministry all over again. They settled to work in the smallest bedroom, which was kept, according to Griphook\u0027s preference, in semidarkness. \"I have visited the Lestranges\u0027 vault only once,\" Griphook told them, \"on the occasion I was told to place inside it the false sword. It is one of the most ancient chambers. The oldest Wizarding families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest and best protected....\" They remained shut in the cupboardlike room for hours at a time. Slowly the days stretched into weeks. There was problem after problem to overcome, not least of which was that their store of Polyjuice Potion was greatly depleted. \"There\u0027s really only enough left for one of us,\" said Hermione, tilting the thick mudlike potion against the lamplight. \"That\u0027ll be enough,\" said Harry, who was examining Griphook\u0027s hand-drawn map of the deepest passageways. The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on now that Harry, Ron and Hermione only emerged for mealtimes. Nobody asked questions, although Harry often felt Bill\u0027s eyes on the three of them at the table, thoughtful, concerned. The longer they spent together, the more Harry realized that he did not much like the goblin. Griphook was unexpectedly bloodthirsty, laughed at the idea of pain in lesser creatures and seemed to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards to reach the Lestranges\u0027 vault. Harry could tell that his distaste was shared by the other two, but they did not discuss it. They needed Griphook. The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after his legs had mended, he continued to request trays of food in his room, like the still-frail Ollivander, until Bill (following an angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue. Thereafter Griphook joined them at the overcrowded table, although he refused to eat the same food, insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and various fungi. Harry felt responsible: It was, after all, he who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell Cottage so that he could question him; his fault that the whole Weasley family had been driven into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley could no longer work. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he told Fleur, one blustery April evening as he helped her prepare dinner. \"I never meant you to have to deal with all of this.\" She had just set some knives to work, chipping up steaks for Griphook and Bill, who had preferred his meat bloody ever since he had been attacked by Greyback. While the knives sliced behind her, her somewhat irritable expression softened. \"\u0027Arry, you saved my sister\u0027s life, I do not forget.\" This was not, strictly speaking, true, but Harry decided against reminding her that Gabrielle had never been in real danger. \"Anyway,\" Fleur went on, pointing her want at a pot of sauce on the stove, which began to bubble at once, \"Mr. Ollivander leaves for Muriel\u0027s zis evening. Zat will make zings easier. Ze goblin,\" she scowled a little at the mention of him, \"can move downstairs, and you, Ron, and Dean can take zat room.\" \"We don\u0027t mind sleeping in the living room,\" said Harry, who knew that Griphook would thing poorly of having to sleep on the sofa; keeping Griphook happy was essential to their plans. \"Don\u0027t worry about us.\" And when she tried to protest he went on, \"We\u0027ll be off your hands soon too, Ron, Hermione, and I. We won\u0027t need to be here much longer.\" \"But, what do you mean?\" she said, frowning at him, her wand pointing at the casserole dish now suspended in midair. \"Of course you must not leave, you are safe \u0027ere!\" She looked rather like Mrs. Weasley as she said it, and he was glad that the back door opened at that moment. Luna and Dean entered, their hair damp from the rain outside and their arms full of driftwood. \"... and tiny little ears,\" Luna was saying, \"a bit like hippo\u0027s, Daddy says, only purple and hairy. And if you want to call them, you have to hum; they prefer a waltz, nothing too fast....\" Looking uncomfortable, Dean shrugged at Harry as he passed, following Luna into the combined dining and sitting room where Ron and Hermione were laying the dinner table. Seizing the chance to escape Fleur\u0027s questions, Harry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin juice and followed them. \"... and if you ever come to our house I\u0027ll be able to show you the horn, Daddy wrote to me about it but I haven\u0027t seen it yet, because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and I never got home for Christmas,\" Luna was saying, as she and Dean relit the fire. \"Luna, we told you,\" Hermione called over to her. \"That horn exploded. It came from an Erumpent, not a Crumple-Horned Snorkack ¨C\" \"No, it was definitely a Snorkack horn,\" said Luna serenely, \"Daddy told me. It will probably have re-formed by now, they mend themselves, you know.\" Hermione shook her head and continued laying down forks as Bill appeared, leading Mr. Ollivander down the stairs. The wandmaker still looked exceptionally frail, and he clung to Bill\u0027s arm as the latter supported him, carrying a large suitcase. \"I\u0027m going to miss you, Mr. Ollivander,\" said Luna, approaching the old man. \"And I you, my dear,\" said Ollivander, patting her on the shoulder. \"You were an inexpressible comfort to me in that terrible place.\" \"So, au revoir, Mr. Ollivander,\" said Fleur, kissing him on both cheeks. \"And I wonder whezzer you could oblige me by delivering a package to Bill\u0027s Auntie Muriel? I never returned \u0027er tiara.\" \"It will be an honor,\" said Ollivander with a little bow, \"the very least I can do in return for your generous hospitality.\" Fleur drew out a worn velvet case, which she opened to show the wandmaker. The tiara sat glittering and twinkling in the light from the low-hanging lamp. \"Moonstones and diamonds,\" said Griphook, who had sidled into the room without Harry noticing. \"Made by goblins, I think?\" \"And paid for by wizards,\" said Bill quietly, and the goblin shot him a look that was both furtive and challenging. A strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as Bill and Ollivander set off into the night. The rest of them squeezed in around the table; elbow to elbow and with barely enough room to move, they started to eat. The fire crackled and popped in the grate beside them. Fleur, Harry noticed, was merely playing with her food; she glanced at the window every few minutes; however, Bill returned before they had finished their first course, his long hair tangled by the wind. \"Everything\u0027s fine,\" he told Fleur. \"Ollivander settled in, Mum and Dad say hello. Ginny sends you all her love, Fred and George are driving Muriel up the wall, they\u0027re still operating an Owl-Order business out of her back room. It cheered her up to have her tiara back, though. She said she thought we\u0027d stolen it.\" \"Ah, she eez charmant, your aunt,\" said Fleur crossly, waving her wand and causing the dirty plates to rise and form a stack in midair. She caught them and marched out of the room. \"Daddy\u0027s made a tiara,\" piped up Luna, \"Well, more of a crown, really.\" Ron caught Harry\u0027s eye and grinned; Harry knew that he was remembering the ludicrous headdress they had seen on their visit to Xenophilius. \"Yes, he\u0027s trying to re-create the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. He thinks he\u0027s identified most of the main elements now. Adding the billywig wings really made a difference ¨C\" There was a bang on the front door. Everyone\u0027s head turned toward it. Fleur came running out of the kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to his feed, his wand pointing at the door; Harry, Ron, and Hermione did the same. Silently Griphook slipped beneath the table, out of sight. \"Who is it?\" Bill called. \"It is I, Remus John Lupin!\" called a voice over the howling wind. Harry experienced a thrill of fear; what had happened? \"I am a werewolf, married to Nymphadora Tonks, and you, the Secret-Keeper of Shell Cottage, told me the address and bade me come in an emergency!\" \"Lupin,\" muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wrenched it open. Lupin fell over the threshold. He was white-faced, wrapped in a traveling cloak, his graying hair windswept. He straightened up, looked around the room, making sure of who was there, then cried aloud, \"It\u0027s a boy! We\u0027ve named him Ted, after Dora\u0027s father!\" Hermione shrieked. \"Wha ¨C? Tonks ¨C Tonks has had the baby?\" \"Yes, yes, she\u0027s had the baby!\" shouted Lupin. All around the table came cries of delight, sighs of relief: Hermione and Fleur both squealed, \"Congratulations!\" and Ron said, \"Blimey, a baby!\" as if he had never heard of such a thing before. \"Yes ¨C yes ¨C a boy,\" said Lupin again, who seemed dazed by his own happiness. He strode around the table and hugged Harry; the scene in the basement of Grimmauld Place might never have happened. \"You\u0027ll be godfather?\" he said as he released Harry. \"M-me?\" stammered Harry. \"You, yes, of course ¨C Dora quite agrees, no one better ¨C\" \"I ¨C yeah ¨C blimey ¨C\" Harry felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now Bill was hurrying to fetch wine, and Fleur was persuading Lupin to join them for a drink. \"I can\u0027t stay long, I must get back,\" said Lupin, beaming around at them all: He looked years younger than Harry had ever seen him. \"Thank you, thank you, Bill\" Bill had soon filled all of their goblets, they stood and raised them high in a toast. \"To Teddy Remus Lupin,\" said Lupin, \"a great wizard in the making!\" \"\u0027Oo does \u0027e look like?\" Fleur inquired. \"I think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like me. Not much hair. It looked black when he was born, but I swear it\u0027s turned ginger in the hour since. Probably blond by the time I get back. Andromeda says Tonks\u0027s hair started changing color the day that she was born.\" He drained his goblet. \"Oh, go on then, just one more,\" he added, beaming, as Bill made to fill it again. The wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled, and Bill was soon opening another bottle of wine. Lupin\u0027s news seemed to have taken them out of themselves, removed them for a while from their state of siege: Tidings of new life were exhilarating. Only the goblin seemed untouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere, and after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he now occupied alone. Harry thought he was the only one who had noticed this, until he saw Bill\u0027s eyes following the goblin up the stairs. \"No... no... I really must get back,\" said Lupin at last, declining yet another goblet of wine. He got to his feet and pulled his traveling cloak back around himself. \"Good-bye, good-bye ¨C I\u0027ll try and bring some pictures in a few day\u0027s time ¨C they\u0027ll all be so glad to know that I\u0027ve seen you ¨C\" He fastened his cloak and made his farewells, hugging the women and grasping hands with the men, then, still beaming, returned into the wild night. \"Godfather, Harry!\" said Bill as they walked into the kitchen together, helping clear the table. \"A real honor! Congratulations!\" As Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying, Bill pulled the door behind him closed, shutting out the still-voluble voices of the others, who were continuing to celebrate even in Lupin\u0027s absence. \"I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn\u0027t been easy to get an opportunity with the cottage this full of people.\" Bill hesitated. \"Harry, you\u0027re planning something with Griphook.\" It was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not bother to deny it. He merely looked at Bill, waiting. \"I know goblins,\" said Bill. \"I\u0027ve worked for Gringotts ever since I left Hogwarts. As far as there can be friendship between wizards and goblins, I have goblin friends ¨C or, at least, goblins I know well, and like.\" Again, Bill hesitated. \"Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you promised him in return?\" \"I can\u0027t tell you that,\" said Harry. \"Sorry, Bill.\" The kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was trying to bring through more empty goblets. \"Wait,\" Bill told her, \"Just a moment.\" She backed out and he closed the door again. \"Then I have to say this,\" Bill went on. \"If you have struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure, you must be exceptionally careful. Goblin notions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same as human ones.\" Harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake had stirred inside him. \"What do you mean?\" he asked. \"We are talking about a different breed of being,\" said Bill. \"Dealings between wizards and goblins have been fraught for centuries ¨C but you\u0027ll know all that from History of Magic. There has been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been innocent. However, there is a belief among some goblins, and those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it, that wizards cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, that they have no respect for goblin ownership.\" \"I respect ¨C\" Harry began, but Bill shook his head. \"You don\u0027t understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins. To a goblin, the rightful and true master of any object is the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin made objects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs.\" \"But it was bought ¨C\" \"¨C then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money. They have, however, great difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects passing from wizard to wizard. You saw Griphook\u0027s face when the tiara passed under his eyes. He disapproves. I believe he thinks, as do the fiercest of his kind, that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original purchaser died. They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made objects, passing them from wizard to wizard without further payment, little more than theft.\" Harry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered whether Bill guessed more than he was letting on. \"All I am saying,\" said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room, \"is to be very careful what you promise goblins, Harry. It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts than to renege on a promise to a goblin.\" \"Right,\" said Harry as Bill opened the door, \"yeah. Thanks. I\u0027ll bear that in mind.\" As he followed Bill back to the others a wry thought came to him, born no doubt of the wine he had drunk. He seemed set on ¨C¨C¨C to become just as reckless a godfather to Teddy Lupin as Sirius Black had been to him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-harry-potter-7/page-25.html","bookId":1567,"book":{"id":1567,"title":"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter #7)","description":"Storyline: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Harry Potter #7) Readers beware. The brilliant, breathtaking conclusion to J.K. Rowling\u0027s spellbinding series is not for the faint of heart--such revelations, battles, and betrayals await in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows that no fan will make it to the end unscathed. Luckily, Rowling has prepped loyal readers for the end of her series by doling out increasingly dark and dangerous tales of magic and mystery, shot through with lessons about honor and contempt, love and loss, and right and wrong. Fear not, you will find no spoilers in our review--to tell the plot would ruin the journey, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is an odyssey the likes of which Rowling\u0027s fans have not yet seen, and are not likely to forget. But we would be remiss if we did not offer one small suggestion before you embark on your final adventure with Harry--bring plenty of tissues. The heart of Book 7 is a hero\u0027s mission--not just in Harry\u0027s quest for the Horcruxes, but in his journey from boy to man--and Harry faces more danger than that found in all six books combined, from the direct threat of the Death Eaters and you-know-who, to the subtle perils of losing faith in himself. Attentive readers would do well to remember Dumbledore\u0027s warning about making the choice between \"what is right and what is easy,\" and know that Rowling applies the same difficult principle to the conclusion of her series. While fans will find the answers to hotly speculated questions about Dumbledore, Snape, and you-know-who, it is a testament to Rowling\u0027s skill as a storyteller that even the most astute and careful reader will be taken by surprise. A spectacular finish to a phenomenal series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a bittersweet read for fans. The journey is hard, filled with events both tragic and triumphant, the battlefield littered with the bodies of the dearest and despised, but the final chapter is as brilliant and blinding as a phoenix\u0027s flame, and fans and skeptics alike will emerge from the confines of the story with full but heavy hearts, giddy and grateful for the experience.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/harry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-harry-potter-7.jpg","author":"J.K.
