{"id":108272,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"The next evening, at sunset, I arrive at the gruff in the desert where the child was conceived. The tall Joshua trees stand around me like guards that would offer me help if they could. But there is no one to help me. Even my own strength and cunning cannot aid me if I am to believe my daughter and Suzama.\n I have brought the dagger James stuck into me.\n It is my only weapon, pitiful as it is.\n Faith is stronger than stone.\n James will not simply murder the child. The divine blood is as important to a demon as it is to a saint. Only the two do not make the same use of it. I know he will have to bring the child to this spot.\n He did not locate the Suzama Center in Palm Springs, so close to this place, by coincidence. Plus my old friend has said as much.\n Then the place of sanctity will be defiled by red stars, and only the innocent will see the blue light of heaven.\n Am I the innocent? At the moment I feel far from it. I know Kalika told me that my thoughts blinded me but I still cannot stop thinking how she let James get so close to the child when she clearly knew what he was and where he was. Of course it could be argued that I stopped her from fleeing, yet in the last minutes of her mysterious life she was content to quit running and sit and play with the child to let what was to be be. James clearly used me to defeat Kalika; he could not have done it alone. Yet Kalika let herself be defeated. Was it because she wished to fulfill the ancient prophecy?\n There the dark forces will once again converge on him, but a powerful angel of mistaken color will rescue him only to lose him again.\n No one mistook Kalika more than her own mother.\n But what am I to do now?\n The rest is a mystery.\n For once, I wish Suzama had hinted a little more.\n What am I to have faith in? I do not miss the fact that Suzama placed faith and stone together in the same sentence, since it was Ory\u0027s control of the earth element that allowed him to defeat me the last time. All right, I have faith in the child. He seems like a cute little guy with incredible vibes and a darling smile. I love him, I really do, and I only got to hold him for a short time. But what am I supposed to do with this faith? It seems I should be able to use it somehow.\n The sun slowly sets. The stars come out.\n The moon has yet to rise.\n I stare at the stars and pray for them to help me.\n Then I realize something quite extraordinary.\n The last time I went to see Suzama, she was wearing a blue scarf that had gold threads woven in it deputing the constellations in the sky, both the northern and the southern sky. Last night Paula was wearing a blue scarf as well, also woven with a pattern in gold thread. In fact, the more I think about it, the more convinced I am that the scarves are identical.\n I am hardly given a chance to wonder how that could be possible.\n Because something strange starts to happen.\n The more I visualize those hauntingly beautiful star patterns in Suzama\u0027s scarf the brighter the stars above me grow. And what is even stranger is that this experience has already been described to me by Paula.\n \"The sky was filled with a million stars. They were so bright! I could have been in outer space.... It was almost as if I had been transported to another world, inside a huge star cluster, and was looking up at its nighttime sky.\"\n The stars grow so bright I can feel their energy on the top of my head, streaming down into my whole body. One star in particular, a bright blue one straight overhead, seems to soar in brilliance as I look up and concentrate on it. It grows in size. It could be a blue saucer racing toward the earth. A high-pitched sound starts to vibrate through the area. Paula\u0027s words are still in my mind.\n \"The rays of the star pierced my eyelids. The sound pierced my ears. I wanted to scream. Maybe I was screaming. But I don\u0027t think I was in actual physical pain. It was more as if I was being trans-formed.\"\n I think I am screaming too. This is how it felt when the moon would pour into the top of my head and turn me into a nice friendly ghost that could float off on the desert wind. But this vibration is thousands of times more intense. It feels as if the starlight is irradiating the nerve fibers in my spinal cord, changing them into magnetic circuits on a cosmic grid, a stellar system of communication and propulsion that has been there since the begin?ning of time, even though no one imagined it existed. I only have to want to plug into it to be able to use it. At the same time, I don\u0027t know if I am in physical distress. Blissful terror is a better expres?sion for it; the entire experience is destroying everything that I thought is me, and yet there is relief in the destruction as well. But just when I think I will either explode or turn into a galactic android, it stops.\n Unlike Paula I do not black out.\n I am suddenly floating high above the desert.\n In a glistening blue body.\n It is very nice. This body, this state of being, carries none of the burdens of the physical realm. I am quite content just to float around with the stars. I can still see the desert far below, the rolling hills of sand, the edges of the shadows of the tall Joshuas shimmering under the intoxicating rays of the galaxy\u0027s stars. I realize then how crucial a role the stars play in our lives, their constant subtle influ?ence bubbles on the edges of energy fields we are unaware we possess. Yet I do not think about it too much because I cannot be bothered thinking.\n After some time I become aware that there is a highly dense bundle of red energy descending from above. Just the sight of it fills me with revulsion and I want to get out of its way. It is the opposite of what I am; it is neither love nor bliss. I desire to avoid it at all costs and I know that I merely have to will myself to be gone.\n It is only then that I fully remember who I am.\n The transformation had caused me momentary amnesia.\n I remember why I have come to the desert. The child.\n Far below me, I see James holding the baby. He is encapsulated in the same red light, but the baby glows in his arms like a tiny blue star. My aware?ness goes up and down, back and forth between them. As the red energy bundle comes closer I see that it is taking on substance, gaining the vague shape of a flying saucer. It seems as if from an unseen realm I am presented with a choice. I can try to enter this ship, in my blue body, and stop what is being planned by the Setians, or I can simply float away and be happy. Yet if I choose the former course, there is danger. I can become trapped, I sense. My very soul can be chained in a place of demons.\n Because if I go into the ship I will have to go into a demon.\n The choice, the universe seems to say, is mine.\n I think of Kalika then, of her great sacrifice.\n This thought makes the choice for me.\n I float into the ship.\n It is a vessel of serpents. There are six of them, big ugly brutes with long tails and scaly hides, thick snouts and cold, dead eyes, all sitting around a square viewing port and each manipulating con?trols of some kind. But one is clearly in charge. Besides being the largest, he has the most highly charged energy field. He is like a swollen red sun from the wrong side of the galaxy. And I know he is the one I have to attack.\n In a moment I am inside his body.\n His mind. What a pit it is.\n This is a true Setian, a genuine demon. His lusts and passions seem to spin in a vortex, yet he is highly intelligent and has worked long and hard to attain the rank he now holds. He is being sent by his superiors on this important mission to bring back the human avatar, the crowning jewel of all prizes. If he is successful, he will be given an opportunity to consume the energy of the child with his masters. His name is Croka and he lives off the emotions of hate and fear. They are food to him as humans are food to him. He can consume the holy child and be strengthened by him. On his home world, I see that black ceremonies will be performed to prepare the feast.\n But Croka is not yet aware that I am in his mind.\n The ship lands in the desert and the six Setians climb out into the night air. Still inside Croka I move with them. Yet I know this ship, these creatures even, are not really physical. The average human, if he or she were to pass this spot, would see nothing, yet he or she would most certainly feel a great dread. Simply to be inside Croka\u0027s mind is a torture as great as any that I have ever known. It is as bad as seeing my own daughter die. Yet I am now determined that her death will not be in vain.\n James can see the Setians. He bows as they sit in a semicircle around him. He stands respectfully, the child in his hands. Little John gazes at them in wonder, the red light cracking and sparking around his blue aura. Clearly the baby can see them, yet he does not cry out. The reptilian Setians are large; even though they are sitting, their ugly heads rise above James\u0027s. The one farthest from Croka bids James bring the child closer. It seems the monster wants to gloat over it, paw it even, and this to me is unbearable. Yet I know the creature will not really harm it. The feast is planned for later, on the Setian hell planet.\n James brings the child to each beast, and each one pokes at it a bit. The child does not cry out and this seems to annoy both the visitors and James. Finally it is brought to Croka, but before he can touch it my eyes fasten on the child\u0027s eyes, and so, in effect, the Setian commander\u0027s eyes are also focused, against his will actually, on the same spot, on the profound gaze of the infant. It is only then that Croka becomes aware that I am sitting deep within his mind, and I understand that this is the moment of greatest danger. For Croka, like most advanced Setians, is a master of seedling, the manipulation of will, and I feel his furious will suddenly rise up against mine.\n He reaches for me too late, because I already have the kavach of the child\u0027s gaze, the armor or protection of the avatar, and seedling loses all power in the presence of a saint. Like Ory of old, Croka carries a dagger in his silver belt, and I reach for it with Croka\u0027s own arm. Before the Setian can stop me, before James even knows what I am up to, I stab the blade in James\u0027s left eye.\n Then all at once I am back in my vampiric body.\n Back in the desert with only James and the child standing before me. The saucer and the Setians appear to be gone. But James is in pain, and I realize that I have already stabbed his own knife into his eye. Well, I think, this time I must have come out of nowhere on him. Quickly, before he can recover, I withdraw the knife and poke it in his other eye, effectively blinding him. He howls in pain and the blood that pours from his wounds is black and foul smelling.\n He drops the child and puts his hands over his torn eyes.\n I catch the child before he hits the ground and set him down gently.\n Then I turn back to James.\n \"Jimmy,\" I say sweetly, \"where do you want me to put the poison? It is a new and improved brand. Guaranteed to kill even a slimy lizard like you.\"\n He swings at me with his right arm and misses, spinning helplessly in front of me, and I stab the knife in his spine behind his heart, just where he shot my daughter. Screaming in agony, he falls to his knees and bows his head. His flaying hands desperately strain to pull out the knife but I know just how powerful the poison is, soaked deep in the folds of the blade itself. He is already doomed.\n \"Sita,\" he gasps. \"You don\u0027t understand what this moment means to this part of the galaxy. You can\u0027t interfere.\"\n I laugh. \"Are you talking about your lizard friends? They are probably still here right now. I\u0027m sure they are, but they don\u0027t have a physical body like mine. They have to work through scummy agents like you. And right now their poor agent can\u0027t even see well enough to tie his own shoes. Oh my.\"\n His face is a mass of black blood. Yet it is as if he is weeping.\n \"You can\u0027t do this,\" he says. \"This night was planned for ages.\"\n I kick him and he cries out again.\n \"Yeah?\" I say. \"Who planned tonight for ages? Not Suzama. Not me. I just wish there were a swarm of flies here and I had the luxury of killing you slowly. But I have other things to do right now.\" I grab him by his mane of messy hair and pull his head back, exposing his throat. \"This, I am going to enjoy.\"\n \"Wait!\" he cries. \"I have not completed my mission! I will not be allowed to transfer to another body!\"\n I pull out the dagger impaled in his spine.\n \"James,\" I say. \"I honestly don\u0027t care.\"\n \"Stop!\" he screams. \"I don\u0027t want to die!\"\n Ah, there is a divine sweetness to total revenge.\n God might not agree but I would argue the point.\n \"Then you should never have been born,\" I say.\n His blood, when I open his neck, flows like black ink.\n There is a loud hiss in my ear. The wind tugs at my hair.\n A flash of red light momentarily blurs the stars.\n The Setians have left, and in a hurry.\n I let go of James and he falls dead on the sand.\n Drawing in a deep breath of fresh air, I laugh out loud.\n The child laughs with me as I carry him back to the road.\n I think he likes me. Really, he is so cute. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/evil-thirst-the-last-vampire-5/page-18.html","bookId":2514,"book":{"id":2514,"title":"Evil Thirst (The Last Vampire #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Evil Thirst (The Last Vampire #5) \n Alisa\u0027s daughter, Kalika, a bloodthirsty monster with powers far beyond Alisa\u0027s, is gone.
