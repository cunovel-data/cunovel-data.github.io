Clive’s Assistance","content":"1 THE snow had fallen more and more heavily while they were on the train, and the air was crisp when they emerged into the dusk at Woods Point. “I think I’m going to like my wedding,” said Rose-Ann. They found a car at the nearest garage to take them to Clive’s place, some two miles away. The driver halted at the edge of a steep ravine that cut down toward the lake. He pointed over to the gleam of a lighted window. “There it is,” he said. “And here’s the path. It goes right along the edge of the ravine, but Mr. Bangs keeps it pretty clean of snow, and there’s a railing by the worst places. I guess you can make it all right. Everybody seems to.” He backed the car about, and left them. Recent footprints, not yet quite obliterated, defined the path for them. They went up toward the house, laughing. Rose-Ann had urged him again at the station to call Clive up and tell him they were coming, and again he had refused. Now, as they edged the ravine, holding on to the railings that guarded the most precarious moments of the path, they were feeling a little foolish and very happy about their adventure. It was thus, they read plainly in each other’s eyes, that they should be married. A little out of breath at the end of the path, they faced a suddenly opened door, and Clive standing there, laughing and puzzled as he tried to make them out. “Felix?” he said. “And who else?” “And Rose-Ann!” cried Felix. “We’ve come to Woods Point to be married!” “No!” cried Clive, astonished, unconsciously blocking the doorway. 115“Yes!” said Felix gaily. Clive laughed. “Welcome!” he said, ushering them inside. “If I’d known you were coming, I’d have met you at the station and guided you to the house. You weren’t afraid of breaking your neck?” And then, as Rose-Ann emerged from her snowy cloak, he took her hand. “So this is Rose-Ann! I’m delighted. You know, Felix isn’t very good at descriptions, and I never got the right idea of you at all.” Felix felt vaguely annoyed. All this was beside the point. “I suppose we can get married here, can’t we?” he asked. Clive looked at him, and then back at Rose-Ann. “How solemn you both are!” he said. “Why, I really believe—Felix, what is this about getting married?” “That’s what we’ve come for,” said Felix patiently. “You mean—” Clive appeared incredulous. “I mean, married. Preacher! License! Ceremony! Didn’t you ever hear of anybody getting married before?” “Not really?” “Yes, really. And right away. Tonight. Is your mind capable of taking all that in, or must I spell it out for you. You seem dazed.” This was not exactly the reception he had expected for his news. “I’m more than dazed. I’m shocked,” said Clive. He turned again to Rose-Ann. “Tell me—when did this—when did you children decide on this rash deed?” “This afternoon,” said Rose-Ann. “It is rash, isn’t it? Do you really think we shouldn’t?” Felix made an impatient movement. What difference did it make what Clive Bangs thought? “Come in by the fire,” said Clive. “You—you bewilder me, you two.” He put a hand, with some kind of vague paternal gesture, on Rose-Ann’s shoulder. “In here”—and he showed them into a room where a coal fire glowed in an open Franklin stove. He arranged three big chairs. “Sit there.... Bad weather outdoors.” “No,” said Rose-Ann, “it’s beautiful! It’s snowing....” 116“I’ll get you something warm to drink,” and Clive left them. They sat there a moment, silent. “Do you—do you think—?” Rose-Ann began in a troubled voice. “I think Clive is a little upset,” he said. “Poor devil!” “You don’t—?” She stopped again. “What?” he asked dreamily, reaching out and finding her fingers as they drooped over the arm of the chair. “Nothing,” she said. Presently he looked up, and met her eyes. A look he had never seen before glowed in them, and it was as if she had shown him some secret part of herself always hidden before. That look seemed to reveal to him, as if for the first time, dazzlingly, by the real truth of their love. It was as if everything they had said to each other had been in some way false and evasive. This was the truth—this ultimate surrender, this faith-beyond-reason, this something deeper than pride and joy in her eyes. He was strangely exalted. He thought: “This—this—is marriage....” In an instant the revelation had passed. Rose-Ann bent down swiftly to shake out a fold in her skirt—and to hide that revealing look, it seemed. Clive was at the door, coming in with their hot drinks. “And now,” said Clive, settling down comfortably in the third big chair, “tell me about it.” 2 Rose-Ann looked at Felix. “We’re going to be married, that’s all,” said Felix. “Yes,” said Clive reflectively, “people do.” “You think we oughtn’t to?” asked Rose-Ann. Clive rubbed his chin. “I really think it is my duty to make one last, however futile, attempt to dissuade you!” “Why?” asked Felix. “Because,” said Clive smiling, “you are so obviously in love with each other now—so obviously happy, just as you are.” 117“And you think marriage will spoil that?” Rose-Ann asked. Clive regarded them. “Well,” he said, “how many people do you know whose marital happiness you would be willing to take as your own?” They were silent, Felix annoyed. “I’ don’t know anybody whose happiness I would want,” said Rose-Ann at last. “But—” “But you hope to have something different, and very much better,” said Clive gently, as if speaking to a child. “I suppose it’s foolish,” said Rose-Ann. “I don’t see anything foolish about it,” said Felix defiantly. “What’s your objection to marriage?” Clive turned upon him with mild surprise. “Is this the young man with whom I have had a number of luncheon discussions—in which, if I remember rightly, you spoke eloquently on this same subject?” Rose-Ann turned to Felix inquiringly. “I don’t think you’ve ever told me your views of marriage, Felix,” she said. Clive laughed. “That is what is known in fiction as a sardonic laugh,” he observed. “I trust you recognized it. I will repeat it for you: Ha, ha! Now, Mr. Fay, is your opportunity to explain to your prospective bride your views of marriage.” Felix flushed. “As a matter of fact, Rose-Ann and I have discussed them,” he said. “‘Relic of barbarism,’” quoted Clive with gentle malice. “Of barbarism?” Rose-Ann repeated, puzzled. “Clive and I have the habit of orating to each other on these subjects,” said Felix, “at lunch and whenever we haven’t anything better to do.” “I’ve heard of those luncheon discussions,” said Rose-Ann, “and wished I could have been present. I’d like to hear you,” she said, looking at Clive and then back to Felix. It was, subtly, her defiance to Clive. “Our discussions,” said Felix, “are devastatingly theoretical. We are accustomed to refer to everything we don’t like 118as a relic of barbarism. Marriage, for instance.... It’s essentially an intrusion by the Elders of the Tribe into the private affairs of the young. The Old People always think they know what is best. Originally, of course, their power to rule the lives of the young was far greater. Rose-Ann and I wouldn’t have been allowed to select a mate for ourselves. The choice would be made for us by the Elders; in their infinite wisdom they would choose for her a lord and master, and she would settle down at once to her proper womanly business of cooking his meals and bringing up his babies. Me they would doubtless have mated with some possessive young hussy who would efficiently smother and drug to sleep with her own physical charms any desire of mine for an impersonal intellectual life. And thus we would both have been made safe and harmless—Rose-Ann with her cooking and babies, and I with my harem of one. Both of us tied down body and soul, and thus presenting no menace to established institutions!” He was speaking quickly, with a feeling that it was all very absurd, this speech-making at large upon a subject which interested them now only in its specific and unique aspects. “But times have changed,” he went on. “This form of tribal control now exists only as a rudimentary survival—a custom to which one must superficially conform, and nothing more. So long as Rose-Ann and I are allowed to choose each other, and decide for ourselves how we are going to live, we can very well permit the Tribe to come in, in the person of its official representative, for ten minutes, and ratify our choice!... There, those are my views, expressed in the uncouth intellectual dialect which Clive and I affect in these discussions. That’s just the way we talk.” “Very clever,” said Clive. “You shift your ground easily....” “A wedding is an awfully tribal thing, isn’t it?” said Rose-Ann soberly. “Especially,” she added more cheerfully, “the old-fashioned kind. With the families and all. And the usher asking you which side you are on, the bride’s or the groom’s! I went to one when I was back in Springfield.” 119“I went to one,” said Clive, “once upon a time, in Chicago.... I had a sense of the girl’s having been recaptured by her family, after a temporary escape—recaptured and subdued. In her white veil, at her father’s side, coming down the aisle, she was so unlike the free wild thing I had known.—Somehow it seemed like a funeral to me—a triumphant and solemn burial of her individuality. I remember that I went away from church saying over to myself that little poem of Victor Plarr’s, that ironic little funeral poem—do you know it? It begins— “Stand not uttering sedately Trite, oblivious praise above her— Rather say you saw her lately Lightly kissing her last lover!” They laughed, interrupting Clive as he began on the next stanza, and then they stopped, waiting for him to go on. They exchanged a swift glance, wondering if this was the girl of the story they had heard. “I forget just how it goes,” he said confusedly. “But it ends something like this— “She is dead: it were a pity To o’erpraise her, or to flout her. She was wild and sweet and witty— Let’s not say dull things about her.” Having finished, he began to poke the fire. “A lovely poem,” said Rose-Ann softly. “But,” said Felix vigorously, “it doesn’t discourage me a bit. I think Rose-Ann can be just as wild and sweet and witty after marriage as before. Her individuality, if that is what you’re worrying about, is not in the least danger of being buried by marriage.” Clive turned to her. “You aren’t afraid the Tribe will get you at last?” he asked. “That would be too bad.” She flushed, as at a compliment. “This marriage will be one final defiance and farewell to the particular tribe to which I belong,” she said. “No, I—I guess I’m not afraid. What do you think, Felix?” 120“Bring on the Tribal Ceremony!” said Felix. “Well,” said Clive, “I’ve done my duty.... And now I’ll see about getting you married.” Felix sighed with relief, and reflected that it was about time Clive began to take the occasion seriously. “I suppose,” said Clive, “that it hasn’t occurred to you that this is Saturday afternoon, and the county clark’s office is closed. And you can’t be married without a license.” Felix looked his chagrin. Of course, he would have forgotten something essential! He glanced sheepishly at Rose-Ann, who seemed merely amused. But why must he be, always, and even in his getting married, a moon-calf? “However,” said Clive, suddenly transformed into the efficient and practical personage that Felix had so often admired, “I think it can be fixed up! I’ll telephone my friend Judge Peabody. And—” he paused for a moment and frowned—“we’ll need another witness. I’ll fix that up, too.” “I’m sorry I forgot about the license,” said Felix as Clive briskly left the room. “It’s all right,” she said. “I forgot, too. It makes no difference.” Clive came back in a few minutes. “It’s all right!” he said. “Judge Peabody says the city council is in session tonight at Waukegan, and the county clark will be there. Judge Peabody will ’phone up there and tell the clark you’re coming. You’ll go there at eight o’clock, right after dinner. I’ve arranged for a car to take you—it’s only a few miles further on. Judge Peabody will be here at nine, and perform the ceremony. The other witness is on the way here, to join us at dinner. And Mrs. Cowan says the dinner will be ready on time. How is that for management?” “You with your objections to marriage!” said Rose-Ann, laughing. “You’re a fraud!” “No,” said Clive. “Merely a born compromiser!”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2781/77012.html","bookId":1311,"book":{"id":1311,"title":"The Briary Bush","description":"简介： Felix Fay saw with his minds eye the map on the wall of the railway stationthe map with a picture of iron roads from all over the middle west centering in a dark blotch in the corner....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2781","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM"}}
