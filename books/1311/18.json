The Authority of the State of Illinois","content":"1 THE car took them through the deepening snow on up to the county seat, where the license was soon made out for them. “You’re lucky to find me here on hand tonight,” said the county clark. They expressed their appreciation. “But I like to accommodate young folks,” he said smiling, and shook hands with them when they left. It was snowing more heavily all the time, and the roads were difficult, but Judge Peabody had kept his promise, and was waiting for them when they arrived. He greeted them with grave benevolence. “Mr. Bangs tells me you want a very simple ceremony,” he said, and put on his spectacles and took out a little book, turning the pages back and forth until he found the right place. “Do you, Felix Fay, take this woman, Rose-Ann Prentiss, to be your wedded wife, to cherish and protect, in sickness and in health, till death do you part?” A promise: a strange defiance flung out by the human spirit against the infinite vicissitudes of chance; a barrier of will against all the hostile forces of the days and years; a renunciation of whatever may lie outside the magic circle of our little mutual happiness, forever; a few weak words, easily forgotten, that must be stronger than passion, stronger than forgetfulness.... “I do,” he said. “Do you, Rose-Ann Prentiss....” “I do.” “Then, by the authority of the State of Illinois, in me vested, I pronounce you husband and wife.” He took off his spectacles and put them in his pocket. 132 2 Rose-Ann and Felix looked at each other in a kind of surprise. So they were married! The judge was wishing them happiness. “And now,” he said, “I’ll hurry home before the snow gets any deeper.” Felix, a little embarrassed, and wishing he could do it less obtrusively, gave him a crumpled bill, which the judge, without embarrassment, smoothed out and placed in a wallet. “Good-night!” he said, and let Phyllis help him on with his overcoat. “Good-night!” At the door he turned. “Oh, by the way,” he said. “Do you want a marriage certificate?” The question was addressed to Rose-Ann. She shook her head in a determined negative. “No?” he repeated absently. “Lots of people don’t, nowadays.... Good-night!” “I suppose you know the house is yours for as long as you want it now,” said Clive to Rose-Ann. “Yes,” she said, “Felix just remembered to tell me a little while ago. It’s terribly nice of you, Clive. I can’t think of a lovelier place to be!” “And that’s the car honking outside,” he said, “to take Phyllis home and me to the station. I shall just catch the ten-fifteen. Efficiency!” He gave her his hand. “I’ll leave you two strictly alone here—but I’ll expect to come and visit you in your real home as soon as you acquire one. May I? You’ll probably be willing by that time to see other human beings again.” “Of course!” she said. “And you, too, Phyllis!” “I’m sorry,” said Phyllis. “I shan’t be here. I’m just home for the week-end, and then I’m off to school again. I hope I shall see you again sometime. I’m sure you’re going to be very happy. Good-bye.” The girls kissed. “Felix,” said Clive, “doesn’t like me any more. He thinks I almost spoiled his wedding. Good-bye, old man!” “Well,” said Rose-Ann, when the door shut them out, 133“that’s over!” She came to him and drooped within his arms. “I’m very tired. Felix, I never want to be married again!” “Poor dear!” he said, “it is rather awful, isn’t it?” “Oh,” she said, lifting her head from his breast, “there’s one more thing to do, before we can be—just us. I promised to save a piece of my wedding cake for somebody.” She smiled. “You can’t guess who!” “Yes, I can,” he said. “Old Granny Perk!”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2781/77014.html","bookId":1311,"book":{"id":1311,"title":"The Briary Bush","description":"简介： Felix Fay saw with his minds eye the map on the wall of the railway stationthe map with a picture of iron roads from all over the middle west centering in a dark blotch in the corner....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2781","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM"}}
