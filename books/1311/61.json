A woman can be something else besides that.” “So it seems. I always had the notion that they understood life better than I did. But I’m mistaken, I guess.” “Would you like to be my keeper?” she flashed out. “Would you want to guard and watch after me, and keep me in the paths I should go in?” He looked at her intently. “So that—that is what you want?” he hazarded. For a moment that seemed to him the truth hidden behind all Rose-Ann’s evasions. But before he had time to read confirmation in her startled eyes, the waiter came up. “Is there anything else?—You don’t like the stew today?” He stood there, a statue of injured pride, looking at the neglected dish. “It’s a noble stew,” said Felix. “Nothing wrong with the stew. Bring our coffee.” “Yes, sir. Shall I take away the stew?” “Please.” He bore it away with a mournful air. 2 Rose-Ann was sitting back in her chair with the air of the discussion having become too absurd to go on with. Felix looked inquiry. “How little we know each other after all,” she said. “Meaning?” “Have you forgotten what you said? I hope so.... 395Felix, if I wanted those things from my lover ... to be kept and guarded ... would I have chosen you?” She dealt the blow lightly, looking away from him. He paled a little. “Perhaps not,” he said sullenly. And then—“Forgive me for being ridiculous.” “I only meant,” she said, still looking away, “that I don’t want to spoil you. I like you as you are.... And if you insist upon being taught the cave-man virtues, why you will have to get some other woman to teach them to you. I decline the office.” “Very well,” he said, “I sha’n’t ask you again.” 3 “It’s just as well the way it has turned out,” she said. “We might have made ourselves miserable trying to please each other. Now we can be ourselves.” “And what is your notion of that?” “For me—freedom.” He smiled incredulously, scornfully. “I’ve been trying,” she said, “against all my principles, to be a wife—for nearly two years. We both agree that I was a failure at it. I shall never try to be a wife again, Felix.... As for freedom—You speak as one who knows what it is. I have still to find out. Do you think you can forbid me my little cupfuls of mad, mystical peace?” “Your coffee,” said the waiter. “If I choose to have adventures, who are you to say No to me?” she said mockingly. Felix did not answer. 4 “My paper is moving to Los Angeles this winter,” Rose-Ann said presently, in a casual tone. “And I suppose,” he replied, in an equally casual way, “that you are going along....” “I hope so,” she said. “The details aren’t settled yet, but I expect to go.... Perhaps very soon.” 396“I forgot to tell you,” he remarked, “that I am writing another play.” “I should like to see it before I go. Won’t you come in to see me occasionally? I’m going to stay in the studio until I leave. There’s no reason why we can’t be friends.” “None whatever,” he said. “I’m glad we’ve had this talk, Felix. Talk does straighten things out, doesn’t it? And now I must hurry back to the office. You will come and see me?” “Yes. I’ll stay and finish my coffee if you don’t mind.” She went away, and he sat there for a long time, smoking cigarettes.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2781/77057.html","bookId":1311,"book":{"id":1311,"title":"The Briary Bush","description":"简介： Felix Fay saw with his minds eye the map on the wall of the railway stationthe map with a picture of iron roads from all over the middle west centering in a dark blotch in the corner....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2781","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:50 AM"}}
