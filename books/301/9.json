{"id":40218,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. THE NEW BOARDING-HOUSE.","content":"It might be considered hazardous for Rufus to invest all his money in a venture which depended to so great an extent upon the honesty of another. But there is no profit without risk, and our hero felt considerable confidence in the integrity of his proposed partner. It occurred to him, however, that he might need some money before he should receive any from the business. Accordingly, as the young man had told him that he had a hundred dollars, he proposed that he should contribute one half of that sum towards the purchase of the shop, while he made up the balance,—four hundred and fifty dollars. This would leave him fifty dollars for contingent expenses, while George Black would have the same. Our hero\u0027s street-life had made him sharp, and he determined to secure himself as far as possible. He accordingly proposed to George Black that they should go to a lawyer, and have articles of agreement drawn up. For this, however, he did not have time till the next morning. One article proposed by Rufus was, that he should draw fifty dollars a quarter towards the third share of the profits, which it was agreed that he should receive, and at the end of the year any balance that might remain due. No objection was made by George Black, who considered this provision a fair one. The style of the firm,—for as most of the capital was furnished by Rufus, it was thought that his name should be represented,—was \"Rushton \u0026 Black.\" A new sign was ordered, bearing their names, and it was arranged that the new proprietors should take possession of the store at the commencement of the next week, when it would probably be ready. Rufus hesitated about announcing his new venture to Miss Manning and Rose, but finally concluded not to do so just at present. It would be time, he thought, when they had got fairly started. Meanwhile he had transferred himself to the room at Mrs. Clayton\u0027s boarding-house. He felt rather bashful at first about appearing at the table. Half an hour before the time, he reached the house, and went up at once to Miss Manning\u0027s room. \"O Rufie!\" said Rose, jumping up from the sofa and running to meet him, \"have you come to stay?\" \"Yes, Rosie,\" he answered, sitting down on the sofa, and taking her in his lap. \"I am so glad. You are going down to dinner, aint you?\" \"Yes, I suppose so.\" \"We have such nice dinners,—don\u0027t we, Miss Manning?\" \"Very nice, Rose.\" \"A great deal better than I ever had before. I wonder where you will sit, Rufie.\" \"He will sit next to you, Rose; I spoke to Mrs. Clayton about it. Rufus will take care of you, and I am to look after Jennie and Carrie.\" \"That will be very nice.\" \"How do you like the little girls, Rose?\" asked her brother. \"Very much. They have given me some of their dolls.\" \"And which knows the most,—you or they?\" \"Oh, I know ever so much more,\" said Rose, positively. \"Is that true, Miss Manning, or is Rose boasting?\" asked Rufus. \"Rose is farther advanced than either Jennie or Carrie,\" answered Miss Manning. \"They have studied comparatively little yet, but I find them docile, and I think they will soon improve.\" By the time Rufus had combed his hair, and put on a clean collar, the dinner-bell rang. He followed Miss Manning down into the dining-room. \"Good-evening, Mr. Rushton,\" said Mrs. Clayton. \"I am glad to see you.\" \"His name isn\u0027t Mr. Rushton,\" said Rose. \"His name is Rufie.\" \"It is the first time Rose ever heard me called so,\" said Rufus, smiling. \"She will soon get used to it.\" He was rather pleased than otherwise to be called Mr. Rushton. It made him feel more like a man. \"You may take that seat, Mr. Rushton,\" said the landlady. \"Your little sister will sit beside you.\" Rufus took the chair indicated. Next to him was seated a lady of thirty or more, whose hair fell in juvenile ringlets. This was Mrs. Clifton, formerly Miss Peyton, who will be remembered by the readers of \"Fame and Fortune.\" Rufus was introduced to her. \"I am very glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Rushton,\" said Mrs. Clifton, graciously. \"You have a very sweet little sister.\" \"Yes; she is a very good little girl,\" said Rufus, better pleased with a compliment to Rose than he would have been with one to himself. \"I understand you are in business in Wall Street, Mr. Rushton.\" \"Yes,\" said Rufus. \"I am in the office of Mr. Turner.\" \"I sometimes tell Mr. Clifton I wish he would go into business in Wall Street. He keeps a dry-goods store on Eighth Avenue.\" \"Can\u0027t remember ever hearing you mention the idea, Mrs. C——,\" remarked her husband, who sat on the other side, in a pause between two mouthfuls. \"There aint much money in dry goods just now, by jove! I\u0027ll open in Wall Street, if you say the word.\" Mrs. Clifton slightly frowned, and did not see fit to answer the remark made to her. Her husband was not very brilliant, either in business, wit, or in any other way, and she had married him, not from love, but because she saw no other way of escaping from being an old maid. \"Do you know, Mr. Rushton,\" said Mrs. Clifton, \"you remind me so much of a very intimate friend of mine, Mr. Hunter?\" \"Do I?\" added Rufus. \"I hope he is good-looking.\" \"He\u0027s very handsome,\" said Mrs. Clifton, \"and so witty.\" \"Then I\u0027m glad I\u0027m like him,\" said Rufus. For some reason he did not feel so bashful as he anticipated, particularly with Mrs. Clifton. \"He\u0027s soon going to be married to a very rich young lady,—Miss Greyson; perhaps you know her.\" \"That\u0027s where he has the advantage of me,\" said Rufus. \"Mr. Clifton,\" said his wife, \"don\u0027t you think Mr. Rushton looks very much like Mr. Hunter?\" \"Yes,\" said her husband; \"as much as I look like the Emperor Napoleon.\" \"Don\u0027t make a goose of yourself, Mr. Clifton,\" said his wife, sharply. \"Thank you, I don\u0027t intend to. A goose is a female, and I don\u0027t care to make such a change.\" \"I suppose you think that is witty,\" said Mrs. Clifton, a little disdainfully. It is unnecessary to pursue the conversation. Those who remember Mrs. Clifton when she was Miss Peyton will easily understand what was its character. It had the effect, however, of putting Rufus at his ease. On the whole, considering that he was only used to cheap restaurants, he acquitted himself very well for the first time, and no one suspected that he had not always been accustomed to live as well. The dinner he found excellent. Mrs. Clayton herself superintended the preparation of dinner, and she was not inclined to undue economy, as is the case with many landladies. \"I\u0027m glad I came here,\" thought Rufus. \"It\u0027s worth the difference in price.\" As they rose from the table, Mrs. Colman asked Miss Manning, \"Is that the brother of your little girl?\" \"Yes,\" answered Miss Manning. \"He has a very good appearance; I should like to have you bring him into our room a while.\" Miss Manning communicated this invitation to Rufus. He would have excused himself gladly, but he felt that this would have been hardly polite; therefore he accepted it. \"I am glad to make your acquaintance, Mr. Rushton,\" said Mrs. Colman. \"Thank you,\" said Rufus. \"I hear that you have come to board with us.\" \"Yes,\" he answered, wishing that he might think of something more to say, but not succeeding. \"It is a pleasant boarding-place; I hope you will like it.\" \"I think I shall.\" \"You have a very nice little sister; my little girls like her very much. She will be a great deal of company for them.\" \"I think she is a very good little girl,\" said Rufus; \"but then I am her brother, so I suppose it is natural for me to think so.\" \"You are in an office in Wall Street, I am told,\" said Mr. Colman. \"Yes, sir,\" said Rufus. \"Whose, may I ask?\" \"Mr. Turner\u0027s.\" \"He is an able business-man, and stands high. You could not learn business under better auspices.\" \"I like him very much,\" said Rufus; \"but then I have not been long in his office.\" \"I find Miss Manning relieves me of a great deal of care and trouble,\" said Mrs. Colman (her new governess being just then out of the room). \"I feel that I was fortunate in securing her services.\" \"I think you will like her,\" said Rufus. \"She is very kind to Rose. I don\u0027t know what I should do with little sister, if I did not have her to look after her.\" \"Then your mother is not living, Mr. Rushton.\" \"No,\" said Rufus; \"she has been dead for two years.\" \"And you are the sole guardian of your little sister?\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" After half an hour\u0027s call, which Rufus found less embarrassing and more agreeable than he anticipated, he excused himself, and went upstairs. On Tuesday of the nest week, he decided to reveal his new plans to Miss Manning. Accordingly, he managed to reach home about half-past four in the afternoon, and invited her and Rose to take a walk with him. \"Where shall we walk?\" she asked. \"Over to Sixth Avenue,\" said Rufus. \"I want to show you a store there.\" Miss Manning soon got ready, and the three set out. It was not far,—scarcely ten minutes\u0027 walk. When they arrived opposite the store, Rufus pointed over to it. \"Do you see that periodical store?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" said Miss Manning. \"How do you like it?\" \"Why do you ask?\" she inquired, puzzled. \"Look at the sign,\" he answered. \"Rushton \u0026 Black,\" read Miss Manning. \"Why, that is your name!\" \"And I am at the head of the firm,\" said Rufus complacently. \"What does it all mean?\" asked Miss Manning. \"How can it be?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you,\" said Rufus. A few words made her understand. \"Now,\" said Rufus, \"let us go over to my store, and look in.\" \"What, is it your store, Rufie?\" asked Rose. \"Yes, little sister, it\u0027s part mine.\" When they entered, they found George Black behind the counter, waiting on a customer, who directly went out. \"Well, George, how\u0027s business?\" asked Rufus. \"It opens well,\" said his partner, cheerfully. \"It\u0027s a good stand, and there\u0027s a good run of custom.\" \"This is my friend, Miss Manning,\" said Rufus, \"and my little sister Rose.\" \"I am glad to see you, Miss Manning,\" said the young man. \"I hope,\" he added, smiling, \"you will give us a share of your patronage.\" \"We\u0027ll buy all our slate-pencils at Rufie\u0027s store, won\u0027t we, Miss Manning?\" said Rose. \"Yes, I think so,\" answered Miss Manning, with a smile. \"Then,\" said Rufus, \"we shall be certain to succeed, if there\u0027s a large profit on slate-pencils, George.\" \"Yes, if you charge high enough.\" After a little more conversation they left the store. \"What do you think of my store, Miss Manning?\" asked Rufus. \"It\u0027s a very neat one. I had no idea you had become so extensive a business-man, Rufus.\" \"Is Rufie an extensive man?\" asked Rose. \"I hope to be some day,\" said Rufus, smiling. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3000/82769.html","bookId":301,"book":{"id":301,"title":"Rufus and Rose","description":"简介： In presenting to the public the last volume of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to return his thanks for the generous reception accorded, both by the press and the public, to these stories of street life.
