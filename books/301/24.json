{"id":40233,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. ESCAPE.","content":"Humpy made up his mind to accept our hero\u0027s offer. Fifty dollars was to him a small fortune, and he saw no reason why he should not earn it. The brutal treatment he had received from Smith removed all the objections he had at first felt. Now, how was he going to fulfil his part of the compact? To release Rufus would be comparatively easy. He happened to know that the key of his own room in the attic would also fit the door of the chamber in which our hero was confined. The difficulty was to get possession of the tin box. He did not even know where it was concealed, and must trust to his own sagacity to find out. To this end he watched his employer carefully whenever he got a chance to do so without being observed, hoping he might take the box out from its place of concealment. Finally Smith noticed the boy\u0027s glances, and said, roughly, \"What are you looking at, boy? Do you think you shall know me the next time you see me?\" Humpy did not reply, but this made him more careful. In the morning he took up our hero\u0027s breakfast, meeting Martin on his way downstairs. \"Well,\" said Rufus, eagerly, as he entered the room, \"have you found out anything about the box?\" \"Not yet,\" said Humpy. \"I\u0027m tryin\u0027 to find where he\u0027s hid it. I can let you out any time.\" \"How?\" \"I\u0027ve got a key that fits this lock.\" \"That\u0027s well, but I\u0027d rather wait till I can carry the box with me.\" \"I\u0027ll do what I can,\" said Humpy. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to watch him sharp. I\u0027d better go down now, or maybe he\u0027ll be suspectin\u0027 something.\" Humpy went downstairs, leaving Rufus to eat his breakfast. On his way down his attention was drawn by angry voices, proceeding from the room in which he had left Smith. He comprehended at once that Smith and Martin were having a dispute about something. He stood still and listened attentively, and caught the following conversation:— \"The boy tells me,\" said Martin, doggedly, \"that there was four hundred dollars in the box. You only gave me fifty.\" \"Then the boy lies!\" said Smith, irritated. \"I don\u0027t believe he does,\" said Martin. \"I don\u0027t like him myself, but he aint in the habit of telling lies.\" \"Perhaps you believe him sooner than you do me.\" \"I don\u0027t see where the three hundred dollars went,\" persisted Martin. \"Considerin\u0027 that I did all the work, fifty dollars was very small for me.\" \"You got half what there was. If there\u0027d been more, you\u0027d have got more.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you wait and open the box when I was there?\" \"Look here,\" said Smith, menacingly, \"if you think I cheated you, you might as well say so right out. I don\u0027t like beating around the bush.\" \"The boy says there was four hundred dollars. Turner told him so.\" \"Then Turner lies!\" exclaimed Smith, who was the more angry, because the charge was a true one. \"The box is just as it was when I opened it. I\u0027ll bring it out and show you just where I found the money.\" When Humpy heard this, his eyes sparkled with excitement and anticipation. Now, if ever, he would find out the whereabouts of the tin box. Luckily for him the door was just ajar, and by standing on the upper part of the staircase he could manage to see into the room. He saw Smith go to a desk at the centre of one side of the room, and open a drawer in it. From this he drew out the box, and, opening it, displayed the contents to Martin. \"There,\" said he, \"that\u0027s where I found the money. There was a roll of ten ten-dollar bills. I divided them into two equal parts, and gave you your share. I was disappointed myself, for I expected more. I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d suspect me of cheating you. But I don\u0027t want any fuss. I\u0027ll give you ten dollars off my share, and then you can\u0027t complain.\" So saying, he took out a ten from his pocket-book, and handed it to Martin. \"Are you satisfied now?\" he asked. \"I suppose I shall have to be,\" said Martin, rather sullenly, for he was by no means sure of the veracity of his confederate. \"It\u0027s all I can do for you at any rate,\" said Smith. \"And now suppose we take breakfast. I shall want you to go to Newark to-day.\" He replaced the box in the drawer, and, locking it, put the key in his pocket. By this time Humpy thought it would do to reappear. \"Where\u0027ve you been all the time?\" asked Smith, roughly. \"The boy upstairs was talkin\u0027 to me.\" \"What did he say?\" \"He asked what was your business.\" \"What did you tell him?\" \"I told him I didn\u0027t rightly know; but I thought you was a manufacturer.\" \"Right, Humpy; you\u0027re a smart boy,\" laughed Smith. \"You know a thing or two.\" The boy showed his teeth, and appeared pleased with the compliment. \"What else did he ask?\" \"He asked, would I let him out?\" \"Did he, the young rascal? And what did you tell him?\" \"Not for Joe!\" \"Good for you! There\u0027s a quarter;\" and Smith offered the boy twenty-five cents. \"If he\u0027d done that yesterday instead of hittin\u0027 me,\" thought Humpy, \"I wouldn\u0027t have gone ag\u0027inst him.\" But the money came too late. Humpy had a brooding sense of wrong, not easily removed, and he had made up his mind to betray his employer. The breakfast proceeded, Humpy waiting upon the table. When the meal was over, Smith gave Martin some instructions, and the latter set out for Newark, which was to be the scene of his operations during the day. About half an hour later Smith said, \"Humpy, I\u0027ve got to go down town; I may be gone all the forenoon. Stay in the house while I am gone, and look out, above all, that that boy upstairs don\u0027t escape.\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Humpy. When Smith left, the coast was clear. There were none in the house except Rufus and the boy who was expected to stand guard over him. The giant had gone to Philadelphia on some business, precisely what Humpy did not understand, and there was nothing to prevent his carrying out his plans. He had two or three old keys in his pocket, and with these he eagerly tried the lock of the drawer. But none exactly fitted. One was too large, the other two were too small. Humpy decided what to do. He left the house, and went to a neighboring locksmith. \"I want to get a key,\" he said. \"What size?\" \"A little smaller than this.\" \"I must know the exact size, or I can\u0027t suit you. What is it the key of?\" \"A drawer.\" \"I can go with you to the house.\" \"That won\u0027t do,\" said Humpy. \"I\u0027ve lost the key, and I don\u0027t want the boss to know it. He\u0027d find out if you went to the house.\" \"Then I\u0027ll tell you what you can do. Take an impression of the lock in wax. I\u0027ll give you some wax, and show you how. Then I\u0027ll make a key for you.\" \"Can you do it right off? I\u0027m in a great hurry.\" \"Yes, my son, I\u0027ll attend to it right away.\" He brought a piece of wax, and showed Humpy how to take an impression of a lock. \"There,\" said he, laughing, \"that\u0027s the first lesson in burglary.\" Humpy lost no time in hurrying back and following the locksmith\u0027s instructions. He then returned to the shop. \"How soon can I have the key?\" \"In an hour. I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027ve got a key that will fit this impression with a little filing down. Come back in an hour, and you shall have it.\" Humpy went back, and seeing that there were some traces of wax on the lock, he carefully washed them off with soap. A little before the hour was up, he reported himself at the locksmith\u0027s. \"Your key is all ready for you,\" said the smith. \"I guess it will answer.\" \"How much is it?\" \"Twenty-five cents.\" Humpy paid the money, and hurried to the house, anxious to make his experiment. The locksmith\u0027s assurance was verified. The key did answer. The drawer opened, and the errand-boy\u0027s eyes sparkled with pleasure as they rested on the box. He snatched it, hastily relocked the drawer, and went up the stairs two at a time. He had the key of his attic room in his pocket. With this he opened the door of the chamber, and, entering triumphantly, displayed to Rufus the tin box. \"I\u0027ve got it!\" he ejaculated. Rufus sprang to his feet, and hurried up to him. \"You\u0027re a trump!\" he said. \"How did you get hold of it?\" \"I haven\u0027t time to tell you now. We must be goin\u0027, or Mr. Smith may come back and stop us.\" \"All right!\" said Rufus; \"I\u0027m ready.\" The two boys ran downstairs, and, opening the front door, made their egress into the street, Rufus with the tin box under his arm. \"Where will we go?\" asked Humpy. \"Are you going with me?\" \"Yes, I want that money.\" \"You shall have it. You have fairly earned it, and I\u0027ll see that you get it, if I have to pay it out of my own pocket.\" \"I shan\u0027t go back,\" said Humpy. \"Why not?\" \"He\u0027ll know I let you out. He\u0027ll murder me if I go back.\" \"I\u0027ll be your friend. I\u0027ll get you something to do,\" said Rufus. \"Will you?\" said the hunchback, brightening up. \"Yes. I won\u0027t forget the service you have done me.\" Rufus had hardly got out these words when Humpy clutched him violently by the arm, and pulled him into a passageway, the door of which was open to the street. \"What\u0027s that for?\" demanded Rufus, inclined to be angry. Humpy put his finger to his lip, and pointed to the street. On the opposite sidewalk Rufus saw Smith sauntering easily along with a cigar in his mouth.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3000/82784.html","bookId":301,"book":{"id":301,"title":"Rufus and Rose","description":"简介： In presenting to the public the last volume of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to return his thanks for the generous reception accorded, both by the press and the public, to these stories of street life.
