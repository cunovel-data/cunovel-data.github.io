{"id":40223,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. MARTIN MAKES A BUSINESS ENGAGEMENT.","content":"Martin was agreeably surprised at the attention paid him by his new friend. There are some who have no difficulty in making friends at first sight, but this had not often happened to him. In fact, there was very little that was attractive or prepossessing about him, and though he could not be expected to be fully aware of that, he had given up expecting much on the score of friendship. Yet here was a stranger, who, to Martin\u0027s undiscriminating eyes, appeared quite the gentleman, who had given him a cigar, paid his dinner-bill, and treated him with a degree of attention to which he was unaccustomed. Martin felt that he was in luck, and if there was anything to be made out of his new friend he was determined to make it. They turned down a side street, perhaps because the stranger\u0027s course led that way, perhaps because he was not proud of his new acquaintance. \"So you\u0027ve had poor luck,\" he remarked, by way of starting the conversation. \"Yes,\" grumbled Martin, \"you may say that. Things have all been ag\u0027inst me. It\u0027s a pretty hard rub for a poor man to get a livin\u0027 here.\" \"Just so,\" said the other. \"What\u0027s your business?\" \"I\u0027m a carpenter.\" \"And you can\u0027t find work?\" \"No,\" said Martin. \"Besides,\" he added, after a pause, \"my health aint very good. Hard work don\u0027t agree with me.\" He might have said that hard drinking did not agree with him, and this would have been rather nearer the truth. But he was afraid his new friend would offer to find him employment as a carpenter, and for this he was not very anxious. There had been a time when he was content to work early and late, for good wages, but he had of late years led such a shiftless and vagabond life, that honest industry had no more attraction for him, and he preferred to get his living by hook or crook, in fact in any way he could, rather than take the most direct path to a good living by working hard for it. \"What is your name?\" \"James Martin. What\u0027s yours?\" \"Mine,\" said the stranger, pausing, and fixing his eyes thoughtfully upon Martin; \"well, you may call me Smith.\" \"That aint a very uncommon name,\" said Martin, thinking he had perpetrated a good joke. \"Just so,\" said the stranger, composedly. \"I\u0027ve been told so often.\" \"Well, Mr. Smith, do you think you could help me to some light business that wouldn\u0027t be too hard on my health?\" \"Perhaps I might,\" said the other. \"What do you think you would like?\" \"Why,\" said Martin, \"if I only had a little capital, I could set up a small cigar store, or maybe a drinkin\u0027 saloon.\" \"That would be light and genteel, no doubt,\" said Smith, \"but confining. You\u0027d have to be in the store early and late.\" \"I might have a boy to stay there when I wanted to go out,\" suggested Martin. \"So you might,\" said the other. \"There doesn\u0027t seem any objection, if you can only raise the capital.\" This was rather a powerful objection, however, especially as Mr. Smith offered no encouragement about supplying the capital himself. Martin saw this, and he added, \"I only mentioned this. I aint any objection to anything else that\u0027s light and easy. Do you think of anything I could do?\" \"I may be able to throw something in your way,\" said Mr. Smith. \"But, first, I must ask you a question. Can you keep a secret?\" \"Yes,\" said Martin, \"just as many as you like.\" \"Because the business which I have to propose is of rather a confidential character, and a great deal depends on its being kept secret.\" \"All right; I\u0027m your man then.\" \"When I saw you in the restaurant,\" said Smith, \"it struck me that you might answer our purpose. You look as if you could be trusted.\" \"So I can be,\" said Martin, pleased with the compliment. \"I\u0027ll never say a word about the matter. What is it?\" \"You shall learn presently,—that is, if my partner thinks we had better engage you.\" \"Where is your place of business?\" \"We will go there. Let us jump into this horse-car.\" They had reached Eighth Avenue, and entered a car bound downwards. When the conductor came along, Smith said, \"I pay for two,\" indicating Martin. This was fortunate; for Martin\u0027s purse was at a low ebb, his entire stock of money being limited to fifty cents. They rode some fifteen minutes, at the end of which Smith signalled to the conductor to stop. \"We get out here,\" he said to Martin. Martin jumped out after him, and they turned westward down one of the streets leading to the North River. \"Is it much farther?\" asked Martin. \"Not much.\" \"It\u0027s rather an out-of-the-way place for business, isn\u0027t it?\" remarked Martin, observing that the street was lined with dwelling-houses on either side. \"For most kinds of business it is,\" said his new acquaintance; \"but it suits us. We like a quiet, out-of-the-way place.\" \"Are you in the wholesale business?\" asked Martin, whose curiosity began to be considerably excited. \"Something of that sort,\" answered the stranger. \"Ah, here we are!\" The house before which he stopped was a brick dwelling-house, of three stories. The blinds were closed, and it might have been readily supposed that no one lived there. Certainly nothing could have looked less like a place of business, so far as outward appearance went, and Martin, whose perceptions were not very acute, saw this, and was puzzled. Still his companion spoke so quietly and composedly, and seemed to understand himself so well, that he did not make any remark. Instead of pulling the bell, Mr. Smith drew a latch-key from his pocket, and admitted himself. \"Come in, Mr. Martin,\" he said. Martin stepped into the entry, and the door was closed. Before him was a narrow staircase, with a faded stair-carpet upon it. A door was partly open into a room on the right, but still there was nothing visible that looked like business. \"Follow me,\" said Smith, leading the way up stairs. Martin followed, his curiosity, if anything, greater than before. They went into a front room on the second floor. \"Excuse me a moment,\" said Smith. Martin was left alone, but in two minutes Smith returned with a tall, powerful-looking man, whose height was such that he narrowly escaped being a giant. \"Mr. Martin,\" said Smith, \"this is my partner, Mr. Hayes.\" \"Proud to make your acquaintance, I am sure, Mr. Hayes,\" said Martin, affably. \"I met your partner this mornin\u0027 in an eatin\u0027-house, and he said you might have a job for me. My health aint very good, but I could do light work well enough.\" \"Did you tell Mr. Martin,\" said the giant, in a hoarse voice that sounded as if he had a cold of several years\u0027 standing, \"that our business is of a confidential nature?\" \"Yes,\" said Martin, \"I understand that. I can keep a secret.\" \"It is absolutely necessary that you should,\" said Hayes. \"You say you can, but how can I be sure of it?\" \"I\u0027ll give you my word,\" said Martin. The giant looked down upon Martin, and ejaculated, \"Humph!\" in a manner which might be interpreted to convey some doubt as to the value of Martin\u0027s word. However, even if Martin had been aware of this, he was not sensitive, and would not have taken offence. \"Are you willing to take your oath that you will never reveal, under any circumstances, anything connected with our business?\" \"Yes,\" said Martin, eagerly, his curiosity being greater than ever. There was a Bible on the table. Hayes cast his eyes in that direction, but first said something in a low voice to Smith. The latter drew a small brass key from his pocket, and opened a cupboard, or small closet in the wall, from which, considerably to Martin\u0027s alarm, he drew out a revolver and a knife. These he laid on the table beside the book. \"What\u0027s that for?\" asked Martin, with an uneasy glance at the weapons. \"I\u0027ll tell you what it\u0027s for, my friend,\" said the giant. \"It\u0027s to show you what your fate will be if you ever reveal any of our secrets. Perhaps you don\u0027t want to take the risk of knowing what they are. If you don\u0027t, you can say so, and go.\" But Martin did not want to go, and he did want to learn the secrets more than ever. \"I\u0027m ready,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll take the oath.\" \"Very well, you understand now what it means. Put your hand on the book, and repeat after me: \u0027I solemnly swear, on the penalty of death by pistol or knife, never to reveal any secret I may have imparted to me in this room.\u0027\" Martin repeated this formula, not without a certain shrinking, not to say creeping, of the flesh. \"Now that you have taken the oath,\" said Smith, \"we will tell you our secret.\" \"Yes,\" said Martin, eagerly. \"The fact is,\" said Smith, in a low voice, \"we are counterfeiters.\" \"You don\u0027t say so!\" ejaculated Martin. \"Yes, there\u0027s a light, genteel business for you. There are all ways of making a living, and that isn\u0027t the worst.\" \"Does it pay pretty well?\" asked Martin, getting interested. \"Yes, it\u0027s a money-making business,\" said Smith, with a laugh; \"but there\u0027s a little prejudice against it, and so we have a very quiet place of business.\" \"Yes, I see,\" said Martin. \"You see the world owes us a living,\" continued Smith, \"as you remarked this morning, and if it doesn\u0027t come in one way, it must in another.\" \"Isn\u0027t it dangerous?\" asked Martin. \"Not if it\u0027s carefully managed.\" \"What do you want me to do?\" \"Supply money to our agents chiefly. It won\u0027t do to have too many come to the house, for it might excite suspicion. You will come every morning, receive money and directions from one of us, and then do as you are bid.\" \"How much will you give me?\" \"What do you say to a hundred dollars a month?\" \"In good money,\" said Martin, his eyes sparkling with pleasure. \"No, of course not. In money of our manufacture.\" Martin\u0027s countenance fell. \"First thing I know I\u0027ll be nabbed,\" he said. \"Not if you are careful. We\u0027ll give you instructions. Do you accept our terms?\" \"Yes,\" said Martin, unhesitatingly. \"Of course you take a risk. No gain without risk, you know. But if you are unlucky, remember your oath, and don\u0027t betray us. If you do, you\u0027re a dead man within twenty-four hours from the time you leave the prison. There are twenty men bound by a solemn oath to revenge treachery by death. If you betray our secret, nothing can save you. Do you understand?\" \"Yes,\" said Martin, whose mind was suitably impressed with the absolute necessity of silence. The representations of his new friends might or might not be true, but, at all events, he believed them to be in earnest, and their point was gained. \"When do you want me to begin?\" he asked. \"To-day; but first it will be necessary for you to be more decently dressed.\" \"These are all the clothes I have,\" returned Martin. \"I\u0027ve been unfortunate, and I haven\u0027t had any money to buy good clothes with.\" \"Have we any clothes in the house that will fit this man?\" asked Smith of his confederate. \"I will go and see.\" The giant soon returned with a suit of clothing, not very fine or very fashionable, but elegant compared with that which Martin now wore. \"I guess these will fit you,\" he said. \"Try them on.\" Martin made the change with alacrity, and when it had been effected, surveyed himself in a mirror with considerable complacency. His temporary abstinence from liquor while at the Island had improved his appearance, and the new suit gave him quite a respectable appearance. He had no objection to appearing respectable, provided it were at other people\u0027s expense. On the whole, he was in excellent spirits, and felt that at length his luck had turned, and he was on the high road to prosperity. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3000/82774.html","bookId":301,"book":{"id":301,"title":"Rufus and Rose","description":"简介： In presenting to the public the last volume of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to return his thanks for the generous reception accorded, both by the press and the public, to these stories of street life.
