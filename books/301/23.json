{"id":40232,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. MARTIN GROWS SUSPICIOUS.","content":"Our hero\u0027s interview with Humpy gave him new courage. When he had felt surrounded by enemies the chances seemed against him. Now he had a friend in the house, who was interested in securing his escape. Not only this, but there was a fair chance of recovering the box for which he was seeking. On the whole, therefore, Rufus was in very good spirits. About nine o\u0027clock he heard a step on the stairs, which he recognized as that of his step-father. He had good reason to remember that step. Many a time while his mother was alive, and afterwards while they were living in Leonard Street, he had listened to it coming up the rickety staircase, and dreaded the entrance of the man whose presence was never welcome. After some fumbling at the lock the door opened, and Martin entered. It was dark, and he could not at first see Rufus. \"Where are you, you young villain?\" he inquired, with a hiccough. Rufus did not see fit to answer when thus addressed. \"Where are you, I say?\" repeated Martin. \"Here I am,\" answered Rufus. \"Why didn\u0027t you speak before? Didn\u0027t you hear me?\" demanded his step-father, angrily. \"Yes, Mr. Martin, I heard you,\" said Rufus, composedly. \"Then why didn\u0027t you answer?\" \"Because you called me a young villain.\" \"Well, you are one.\" Rufus did not answer. Martin locked the door and put the key in his pocket. He next struck a match, and lit the gas. Then seating himself in a rocking-chair, still with his hat on, he looked at Rufus with some curiosity, mingled with triumph. \"I hope you like your accommodations,\" he said. \"Pretty well.\" \"We don\u0027t charge you nothing for board, you see, and you haven\u0027t any work to do. That\u0027s what I call living like a gentleman.\" \"I believe you tried the same kind of life at Blackwell\u0027s Island,\" said Rufus. \"Look here,\" said Martin, roughly, \"you\u0027d better not insult me. I didn\u0027t come here to be insulted.\" \"What did you come for, then?\" asked Rufus. \"I thought you\u0027d like to know how Rose was,\" answered Martin. \"I don\u0027t believe you have seen her.\" \"Well, you needn\u0027t believe it. Perhaps I didn\u0027t meet her on the street, and follow her home. She begged me to tell her where you was; but I couldn\u0027t do it.\" Rufus felt a temporary uneasiness when he heard this statement; but there was something in Martin\u0027s manner which convinced him that he had not been telling the truth. He decided to change the subject. \"Mr. Martin,\" he said, \"have you made up your mind to give up that tin box?\" \"No I haven\u0027t. I can\u0027t spare it.\" \"If you will give it up, I will see that you are not punished for taking it.\" \"I aint a-goin\u0027 to be punished for taking it.\" \"You certainly will be if you are caught.\" \"What do you know about it?\" \"There was a man convicted of the same thing three months ago, and he got five years for it.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it,\" said Martin, uneasily. \"You needn\u0027t if you don\u0027t want to.\" \"I haven\u0027t got the box now, so I couldn\u0027t give it back. Smith\u0027s got it.\" \"Is that the man I saw this morning?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then you\u0027d better ask him to give it back to you.\" \"He wouldn\u0027t do it if I asked him.\" \"Then I\u0027m sorry for you.\" Martin was not very brave, and in spite of his assertions he felt uneasy at what Rufus was saying. Besides, he felt rather afraid of our hero. He knew that Rufus was a resolute, determined boy, and that he could not keep him confined forever. Some time he would get out, and Martin feared that he would set the officers on his track. The remark of Smith that he would make a good boy for their business occurred to him, and he determined to try him on a new tack. If he could get him compromised by a connection with their business, it would be for his interest also to keep clear of the police. \"Rufus,\" said Martin, edging his chair towards our hero, \"I\u0027m your friend.\" Rufus was rather astonished at this sudden declaration. \"I\u0027m glad to hear it,\" he said; \"but I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve treated me in a very friendly manner.\" \"About the tin box?\" \"Yes, partly that. If you\u0027re my friend, you will return it, and not keep me locked up here.\" \"Never mind, Rufus, I\u0027ve got a business proposal to make to you. You\u0027re a smart boy.\" \"I am glad you think so.\" \"And I can give you a chance to make a good living.\" \"I am making a good living now, or I was before you interfered with me.\" \"How much did you earn a week?\" \"Why do you want to know?\" \"Was it over ten dollars a week?\" \"About that.\" \"I know a business that will pay you fifteen dollars a week.\" \"What is it?\" \"It is the one I\u0027m in. I earn a hundred dollars a month.\" \"If you are earning as much as that, I shouldn\u0027t think you\u0027d need to steal tin boxes.\" \"There wasn\u0027t much in it. Only a hundred dollars in money.\" \"You are not telling me the truth. There were four hundred dollars in it.\" \"What was that you said?\" asked Martin, pricking up his ears. \"There were four hundred dollars in it.\" \"How do you know?\" \"Mr. Turner told me so.\" \"Smith told me there were only a hundred. He opened it, and gave me half.\" \"Then he gave you fifty, and kept three hundred and fifty himself.\" \"If I thought that, I\u0027d smash his head!\" said Martin, angrily. \"Make me run all the risk, and then cheat me out of my hard earnin\u0027s. Do you call that fair?\" \"I think he\u0027s been cheating you,\" said Rufus, not sorry to see Martin\u0027s anger with his confederate. \"It\u0027s a mean trick,\" said Martin, indignantly. \"I\u0027d ought to have got two hundred. It was worth it.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t do what you did for a good deal more than two hundred dollars. You haven\u0027t told me what that business was that I could earn fifteen dollars a week at.\" \"No,\" said Martin, \"I\u0027ve changed my mind about it. If Smith\u0027s goin\u0027 to serve me such a mean trick, I won\u0027t work for him no longer. I\u0027ll speak to him about it to-morrow.\" Martin relapsed into silence. Rufus had given him something to think about, which disturbed him considerably. Though he had been disappointed in the contents of the box, he had not for a moment doubted the good faith of his confederate, and he was proportionately incensed now that the latter had appropriated seven dollars to his one. Considering that he had done all the work, and incurred all the danger, it did seem rather hard. There was one bed in the room, rather a narrow one. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to bed,\" said Martin, at length. \"I guess the bed\u0027ll be big enough for us both.\" \"Thank you,\" said Rufus, who did not fancy the idea of sleeping with his step-father. \"If you\u0027ll give me one of the pillows, I\u0027ll sleep on the floor.\" \"Just as you say, but you\u0027ll find it rather hard sleepin\u0027.\" \"I shan\u0027t mind.\" This was the arrangement they adopted. Martin took off his coat and vest, and threw himself on the bed. He was soon asleep, as his heavy breathing clearly indicated. Rufus, stretched on the floor, lay awake longer. It occurred to him that he might easily take the key of the door from the pocket of Martin\u0027s vest, which lay on the chair at his bedside, and so let himself out of the room. But even then it would be uncertain whether he could get out of the house, and he would have to leave the tin box behind him. This he hoped to get hold of through Humpy\u0027s assistance. On the whole, therefore, it seemed best to wait a little longer. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3000/82783.html","bookId":301,"book":{"id":301,"title":"Rufus and Rose","description":"简介： In presenting to the public the last volume of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to return his thanks for the generous reception accorded, both by the press and the public, to these stories of street life.
