{"id":40235,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. UNPLEASANT DISCOVERIES.","content":"Smith did not go home immediately. He intended to do so, but happened to think of an errand, and this delayed him for an hour or two. When he entered the house, he looked around for his errand-boy, but looked in vain. \"Humpy!\" he called out in a voice which could be heard all over the house. There was no answer. Smith, who was not remarkable for patience, began to grow angry. \"Very likely the young rascal is in his room,\" he said to himself. \"I\u0027ll stir him up.\" He took the whip and ascended the stairs two or three at a time. Arrived in the attic, he peered into Humpy\u0027s room, but, to his disappointment, saw nobody. \"The little villain got tired of waiting, and went out, thinking I couldn\u0027t find him out,\" he muttered. \"He shall have a taste of the whip when he comes back.\" He went downstairs more slowly than he ascended. He was considerably irritated, and in a state that required an object to vent his anger upon. Under these circumstances his prisoner naturally occurred to him. He had the proper key in his pocket, and, stopping on the second floor, he opened the door of the chamber in which our hero had been confined. His anger may be imagined when he found it untenanted. It was not very dignified, but Smith began to stamp in his vexation, and lash with his whip an unoffending chair in which Rufus ought to have been seated. \"I wish it was that young villain!\" muttered Smith, scowling at the chair, and lashing it harder. \"I\u0027d teach him to run away! I\u0027d make him howl!\" Smith was considerably discomposed. Things were going decidedly against him. Besides, the escape of Rufus might entail serious consequences, if he should give information to the police about the place of his captivity. A visit from these officials was an honor which Smith felt disposed respectfully, but firmly, to decline. Unfortunately, however, policemen are not sensitive, and are very apt to intrude where they are not wanted. A visit to Smith\u0027s abode might lead to unpleasant discoveries, as he very well knew, and he could not easily decide what course it would be best for him to pursue. He inferred at once that Humpy had been bought over, and had released the prisoner, otherwise he would, undoubtedly, have detected or frustrated our hero\u0027s attempt to escape. This did not inspire very amiable feelings towards Humpy, whom it would have yielded him great satisfaction to get into his power. But Humpy had disappeared, and that satisfaction was not to be had. Mingled with Smith\u0027s anger was a feeling of surprise. Humpy had been a good while in his employ, and he had reposed entire confidence in his fidelity. He might have continued to do so but for the brutal assault upon the boy recorded in a previous chapter. He did not think of this, however, or guess the effect it had produced on the mind of the deformed errand-boy. \"I think I had better get out of the city a week or two till this blows over,\" thought Smith. \"I guess I\u0027ll take the afternoon train for Philadelphia.\" This was a wise resolution; but Smith made one mistake. He ought to have put it into effect at once. At that very moment information was lodged at the office of police, which threatened serious consequences to him; but of this he was ignorant. He had no idea that Rufus would act so promptly. In spite of his anger Smith was hungry. His morning walk had given him an excellent appetite, and he began to think about dinner. As, on account of the unlawful occupation in which he was engaged, he did not think it prudent to employ a cook, who might gossip about his affairs, he generally devolved the task of preparing the dinner upon Humpy, whom he had taught to cook eggs, broil beef-steak, make coffee, fry potatoes, and perform other simple culinary duties. Now that Humpy was gone, he was obliged to do this work himself. He looked into the pantry, and found half-a-dozen eggs, and a slice of steak. These he proceeded to cook. He had nearly finished his unaccustomed task when the door opened, and Martin returned, with his nose a little redder than usual, and his general appearance somewhat disordered by haste. \"What brings you here so soon?\" asked Smith, in surprise. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"I came near gettin\u0027 nabbed; that\u0027s what\u0027s the matter,\" said Martin. \"How did that happen?\" \"I went into a cigar-store near the ferry in Jersey City,\" said Martin, \"and asked for a couple of cigars,—twenty-cent ones. I took \u0027em, and handed in one of your ten-dollar bills. The chap looked hard at it, and then at me, and said he\u0027d have to go out and get it changed. I looked across the street, and saw him goin\u0027 to the police-office. I thought I\u0027d better leave, and made for the ferry. The boat was just goin\u0027. When we\u0027d got a little ways out, I saw the cigar man standin\u0027 on the drop with a copp at his elbow.\" \"You\u0027d better not go to Jersey City again,\" said Smith. \"I don\u0027t mean to,\" said Martin. \"Have you got enough dinner for me? I\u0027m as hungry as a dog.\" \"Yes, there\u0027s dinner enough for two, and that\u0027s all there is to eat it.\" Something significant in his employer\u0027s tone struck Martin. \"There\u0027s the boy upstairs,\" he said. \"There isn\u0027t any boy upstairs.\" \"You haven\u0027t let him go?\" queried Martin, staring open-mouthed at the speaker. \"No, he got away while I was out this morning,—the more fool I for leaving him.\" \"But there was Humpy. How did the boy get away without his seeing him?\" \"Humpy\u0027s gone too.\" \"You don\u0027t say!\" ejaculated Martin. \"Yes, I do.\" \"What you goin\u0027 to do about it?\" inquired Martin, hopelessly. \"I\u0027ll half kill either of the little rascals when I get hold of them,\" said Smith, spitefully. \"I\u0027d give something out of my own pocket to get that undootiful son of mine back,\" chimed in Martin. \"I\u0027ll say this for him,\" said Smith, \"he\u0027s a good sight smarter than his father.\" \"I always was unlucky,\" grumbled Martin. \"I aint been treated right.\" \"If you had been you\u0027d be at Sing Sing,\" returned Smith, amiably. \"Smith,\" said Martin, with drunken dignity, for he was somewhat under the influence of a liberal morning dram, \"you\u0027d ought to respect the feelin\u0027s of a gentleman.\" \"Where\u0027s the gentleman? I don\u0027t see him,\" responded Smith, in a sarcastic tone. \"If you aint too much of a gentleman to do your share of the work, just draw out the table and put the cloth on.\" This Martin, who was hungry, did with equal alacrity and awkwardness, showing the latter by over-turning a pile of plates, which fell with a fatal crash upon the floor. \"Just like your awkwardness, you drunken brute!\" exclaimed Smith, provoked. Martin did not reply, but looked ruefully at the heap of broken crockery, which he attributed, like his other misfortunes, to the ill-treatment of the world, and meekly got upon his knees and gathered up the pieces. At length dinner was ready. Martin, in spite of an ungrateful world, ate with an appetite truly surprising, so that his companion felt called upon to remonstrate. \"I hope you\u0027ll leave a little for me. It\u0027s just possible that I might like to eat a little something myself.\" \"I didn\u0027t eat much breakfast,\" said Martin, apologetically. \"You\u0027d better lunch outside next time,\" said his employer. \"It will give you a good chance to change money.\" \"I\u0027ve tried it at several places,\" said Martin; \"I could do it better if you\u0027d give me some smaller bills. They don\u0027t like to change fives and tens.\" After dinner was despatched, and the table pushed back, Smith unfolded his plans to Martin. He suggested that it might be a little unsafe to remain at their present quarters for a week or fortnight to come, and counselled Martin to go to Boston, while he would go to Philadelphia. \"That\u0027s the way we\u0027ll dodge them,\" he concluded. \"Just as you say,\" said Martin. \"When do you want me back?\" \"I will write you from Philadelphia. You can call at the post-office for a letter in a few days.\" \"When had I better sell the bond?\" \"That reminds me,\" said Smith. \"I will take the box with me.\" He went and unlocked the drawer in which the box had been secreted. To his dismay he discovered that it was gone. \"Have you taken the tin box?\" he demanded, turning upon Martin with sudden suspicion. \"Isn\u0027t it there?\" gasped Martin. \"No, it isn\u0027t,\" said Smith, sternly. \"Do you know anything about it?\" \"I wish I may be killed if I do!\" asserted Martin. \"Then what can have become of it?\" \"It\u0027s my undootiful boy that took it,—I\u0027m sure it is,\" exclaimed Martin, with sudden conviction. \"He had no key.\" \"Humpy got him one, then.\" Just then Smith espied on the floor some scraps of wax. They told the story. \"You\u0027re right,\" he said, with an oath. \"We\u0027ve been taken in worse than I thought. The best thing we can do is to get away as soon as possible.\" They made a few hurried preparations, and left the house in company. But they were too late. A couple of officers, who were waiting outside, stepped up to them, as they set foot on the sidewalk, and said, quietly, \"You must come with us.\" \"What for?\" demanded Smith, inclined to show fight. \"You\u0027d better come quietly. You are charged with stealing a box containing valuables.\" \"That\u0027s the man that did it,\" said Smith, pointing to Martin. \"He\u0027s the one you want.\" \"He put me up to it, and shared the money,\" retorted Martin. \"You\u0027re both wanted,\" said the officer. \"You\u0027ll have a chance to tell your story hereafter.\" As this winds up the connection of these two worthies with our story, it may be added here that they were found guilty, not only of the robbery, but of manufacturing and disseminating counterfeit money, and were sentenced to Sing Sing for a term of years. The bonds were found upon them, and restored to Mr. Vanderpool. Thus the world persists in its ill-treatment of our friend, James Martin. Still I cannot help thinking that, if he had been a sober and industrious man, he would have had much less occasion to complain. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3000/82786.html","bookId":301,"book":{"id":301,"title":"Rufus and Rose","description":"简介： In presenting to the public the last volume of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to return his thanks for the generous reception accorded, both by the press and the public, to these stories of street life.
