{"id":40217,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VII. A NEW ENTERPRISE.","content":"Rufus felt some doubts as to whether he had done wisely in agreeing to board at Mrs. Clayton\u0027s. His own board, together with what he paid for his sister\u0027s board and clothes, would just take up the whole of his salary. However, he would have the interest on his five hundred dollars, now deposited in a savings-bank, and yielding six per cent. interest annually. Still this would amount only to thirty dollars, and this would not be sufficient to pay for his clothes alone, not to mention miscellaneous expenses, such as car-fares and other incidental expenses. He felt that he should like now and then to go on an excursion with his sister and Miss Manning, or perhaps to a place of amusement. For all this, one hundred dollars a year would be needed, at a moderate calculation. How should he make up this amount? Two ways suggested themselves to Rufus. One was, draw upon his principal. Probably he would not be obliged to do this very long, as, at the end of six months, it was probable that his salary would be raised if he gave satisfaction, and this he meant to do. Still, Rufus did not like this plan, for five hundred dollars seemed a good round sum, and he wanted to keep it all. The other way was to make up the necessary sum by extra work outside of the office. This idea he liked best. But it suggested another question, which was not altogether easy to answer. \"What should he do, or what kind of work should he choose?\" He might go back to his old employment. As he was not required to be at the office before nine o\u0027clock, why should he not spend an hour or two in the early morning in selling newspapers? He felt confident that he could in this way clear two dollars a week. But there were two objections which occurred to him. The first was, that as Mrs. Clayton\u0027s breakfast was at half-past seven in the winter, and not earlier than seven in the summer, he would be obliged to give it up, and take breakfast at some restaurant down town. His breakfasts, probably, would come to very nearly the sum he would make by selling papers, and as Mrs. Clayton took him under her usual price, it was hardly to be expected that she would make any allowance for his absence from the morning meal. Besides, Rufus had left his old life behind him, and he did not want to go back to it. He doubted, also, whether his employer would like to have him spend his time before office hours in selling papers. Then, again, he was about to board at a house of very good rank, and he felt that he did not wish to pass among his new acquaintances as a newsboy, if he could get something better to do. Of course it was respectable, as all honest labor is; but our hero felt that by this time he was suited to something better. The more Rufus balanced these considerations in his mind, the more perplexed he became. Meanwhile he was walking down Broadway on his way to the office. Just as he was crossing Canal Street, some one tapped him on the shoulder. Turning round, he recognized a young man whom he remembered as clerk in a stationery store in Nassau Street. His name was George Black. \"Rough and Ready!\" he exclaimed, in surprise. \"Is this you? Why are you not selling papers? You got up late this morning, didn\u0027t you?\" \"I\u0027ve given up selling papers,\" said Rufus. \"How long since?\" \"Only a few days.\" \"What are you up to now?\" \"I\u0027m in an office in Wall Street.\" \"What sort of an office?\" \"A banker\u0027s,—Mr. Turner\u0027s.\" \"Yes, I know the firm. What do you get?\" \"Eight dollars a week.\" \"That\u0027s pretty good,—better than selling papers.\" \"Yes, I like it better, though I don\u0027t make any more money than I did before. But it seems more like business.\" \"Well, you\u0027ve found a place, and I\u0027ve lost one.\" \"How is that?\" \"My employer failed, and the business has gone up,\" said Black. \"I suppose you are looking for a new place.\" \"Yes; but I wouldn\u0027t if I only had a little capital.\" \"What would you do then?\" \"I was walking up Sixth Avenue yesterday, when I saw a neat little periodical and fancy goods store for sale, on account of the owner\u0027s illness. It\u0027s a very good location, and being small does not require much capital to carry it on. The rent is cheap,—only twenty dollars a month. By adding a few articles, I could make a thousand dollars a year out of it.\" \"Why don\u0027t you take it?\" \"Because I haven\u0027t got but a hundred dollars in the world, and I expect that will be gone before I get a new place.\" \"What does the owner want for his stock?\" \"He says it cost him seven hundred dollars; but he\u0027s sick, and wants to dispose of it as soon as possible. He\u0027ll sell out for five hundred dollars cash.\" \"Are you sure the stock is worth that much?\" asked Rufus. \"Yes, I am sure it is worth more. I\u0027ve been in the business, and I can judge.\" \"Why don\u0027t you borrow the money?\" \"It is easy enough to say that, but where shall I find anybody to lend it?\" \"You might take a partner with money.\" \"So I might, if I could find one.\" \"Look here, Mr. Black,\" said Rufus, in a businesslike tone, \"what offer will you make to any one who will furnish you the money to buy out this shop?\" \"Do you know of anybody who has got the money?\" asked the young man. \"Perhaps I do, and perhaps I don\u0027t; but maybe I might find somebody.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. If any one will set me up there, I will give him a third of the profits after paying expenses.\" \"And you think that you can make a thousand dollars a year?\" \"Yes, I feel sure of it.\" \"That\u0027s a good offer,\" said Rufus, meditatively. \"I\u0027m willing to make it. At that rate I shall make fourteen dollars a week, and I have never been paid but twelve for clerking it. Besides, I should be my own master.\" \"You might not make so much.\" \"If I make less I can live on less. There\u0027s a small room in back, where I can put in a bed, that will save me room-rent. My meals I can buy at the restaurants. I don\u0027t believe it will cost me over three hundred and fifty dollars to live.\" \"So that you could save up money.\" \"Yes, I should be sure to. After a while I could buy out the whole business.\" Rufus was silent for a moment. He had five hundred dollars. Why should he not set up George Black in business on the terms proposed? Then, instead of getting a paltry thirty dollars\u0027 interest for his money, he would get two or three hundred dollars, and this would abundantly make up what he needed to live in good style at Mrs. Clayton\u0027s, and afford Rose and himself occasional recreation. Of course a good deal depended on the honesty of George Black. But of this young man Rufus had a very good opinion, having known him for two or three years. Besides, as partner he would be entitled to inquire into the state of the business at any time, and if anything was wrong he would take care that it was righted. \"What are you thinking about?\" inquired the young man, observing his silence. \"How would you like me for a partner?\" asked Rufus, looking up suddenly. \"I\u0027d just as lief have you as anybody, if you had the money,\" said George Black. \"I have got the money,\" said our hero. \"You don\u0027t mean to say you\u0027ve got five hundred dollars?\" asked Black, in surprise. \"Yes, I do.\" \"How did you get it? You didn\u0027t make it selling papers in the street.\" \"You may bet on that. No; I found part of it and the rest I had given me.\" \"Tell me about it.\" Rufus did so. \"Where is the money?\" \"I keep it in a savings-bank.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what, Rufus,\" said George, \"if you\u0027ll buy out the shop for me, and come in as my partner, I\u0027ll do what I said, and that\u0027ll be a good deal better than the savings-bank can do for you.\" \"That\u0027s true; but there\u0027ll be more risk.\" \"I don\u0027t think there will. I shall manage the business economically, and you can come in any time and see how it\u0027s going on. But I never thought you had so much money.\" \"If you had, maybe you\u0027d have thought more of me,\" said Rufus. \"Maybe I should. \u0027Money makes the mare go\u0027 in this world. But when will you let me know about it? I\u0027ve only got two days to decide in.\" \"I should like to see the shop myself,\" said Rufus, with commendable prudence. \"Of course; that\u0027s what I\u0027d like to have you do. When will you come round with me and see it?\" \"I can\u0027t come now,\" said our hero, \"for it would make me late at the office. Is it open in the evening?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then I\u0027ll tell you what. I\u0027ll meet you there this evening at eight o\u0027clock. Just give me the number, and I\u0027ll be sure to be there.\" \"All right. Have you got a pencil?\" \"Yes; and here\u0027s one of our cards. You can put it down here.\" The address was put down, and the two parted. George Black went round to the shop at once to say that he would probably be able to make an arrangement. In the evening, at the appointed hour, the two met at the periodical store. Rufus was favorably impressed on first entering. The room was small, but it was very neat. It had a good window opening to the street, and it appeared well filled with stock. A hasty survey satisfied our hero that the stock was really worth more than the amount asked for it. The proprietor seemed a sickly-looking man, and the plea of ill-health, judging from his appearance, might readily be credited. \"This is the capitalist I spoke of this morning,\" said George Black, introducing Rufus. \"He seems young,\", said the proprietor, a little surprised. \"I\u0027m not very aged yet,\" said Rufus, smiling. \"The main thing is, that he\u0027s got the money,\" said Black. \"He\u0027s in business in Wall Street, and is looking about for an investment of his spare funds.\" Rufus was rather pleased with this way of stating his position. He saw that it heightened his importance considerably in the mind of the owner of the shop. \"He\u0027ll do well to invest here,\" said the latter. \"It\u0027s a good stand. I wouldn\u0027t sell out if my health would let me hold on. But confinement doesn\u0027t suit me. The doctor says I shan\u0027t live a year, if I stay here, and life is better than money.\" \"That\u0027s so.\" \"How long has this shop been established?\" asked Rufus. \"Five years.\" \"It ought to be pretty well known.\" \"Yes; it\u0027s got a good run of custom. If the right man takes hold of it, he\u0027ll make money. He can\u0027t help it.\" \"What do you think of it, Rufus?\" asked George Black, turning to our hero. \"Isn\u0027t it as I represented?\" \"Yes,\" said Rufus. \"I should think a good business might be done here.\" \"If I get hold of it, a good business shall be done here,\" said Black, emphatically. \"But it all depends on you. Say the word, and we\u0027ll close the bargain now.\" \"All right!\" said Rufus, promptly. \"I\u0027ll say the word. We\u0027ll take the shop.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3000/82768.html","bookId":301,"book":{"id":301,"title":"Rufus and Rose","description":"简介： In presenting to the public the last volume of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to return his thanks for the generous reception accorded, both by the press and the public, to these stories of street life.
