{"id":40227,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. DIVIDING THE SPOILS.","content":"Martin did not fail to go to the house occupied by his employers, in the evening. He was anxious to learn the amount of the booty which he had taken. He decided that it must be ten thousand dollars at least. Half of this would be five thousand, and this, according to the agreement between them, was to come to him. It was quite a fortune, and the thought of it dazzled Martin\u0027s imagination. He would be able to retire from business, and resolved to do so, for he did not like the risk which he incurred by following his present employment. Martin had all his life wished to live like a gentleman,—that is, to live comfortably without work; and now his wish seemed likely to be gratified. In the eyes of some, five thousand dollars would seem rather a small capital to warrant such a life; but it seemed a great deal to a shiftless character like him. Besides, the box might contain more than ten thousand dollars, and in that case, of course, his own share would be greater. So, on the whole, it was with very pleasant anticipations that Martin ascended the front steps of the counterfeiter\u0027s den, and rang the bell. Meanwhile Smith had opened the box, and his disappointment had been great when he found the nature of its contents. Actually but four hundred dollars were immediately available, and, as the banker no doubt had recorded the number of the government bonds, there would be risk in selling them. Besides, even if sold, they would produce, at the market price, barely eleven hundred dollars. As to the bank and railway shares, they could not be negotiated, and no doubt duplicates would be applied for. So, after all, the harvest was likely to prove small, especially as Smith had passed his word to divide with Martin. After a while it occurred to him that, as Martin did not know the contents of the box, he could easily be deceived into supposing them less than they were. He must tell a falsehood; but then Smith\u0027s conscience was tough, and he had told a great many in the course of his life. When Martin was ushered into the room, he found his confederate looking rather sober. \"Have you opened the box?\" inquired Martin, eagerly. \"Yes,\" said Smith, rather contemptuously. \"A great haul you made, I must say.\" \"Wasn\u0027t there anything in it?\" asked Martin, in dismay. \"Yes, there were plenty of bank and railroad shares.\" \"Can\u0027t we sell them?\" queried Martin, whose knowledge of business was limited. \"You must be a fool! We can\u0027t sell them without the owner\u0027s indorsement. Perhaps you\u0027ll call and ask him for it.\" \"Can\u0027t we do anything with them, then?\" asked Martin, anxiously. \"Nothing at all.\" \"Wasn\u0027t there nothing else in the box?\" \"Yes, there was a government bond for five hundred dollars.\" Smith concluded to mention only one. \"That\u0027s something.\" \"Yes, it\u0027s something. You can sell it after a while, and bring me half the money.\" \"Will there be any danger in selling it?\" \"None to speak of,\" said Smith, who was afraid Martin might decline selling it, unless he gave this assurance. \"Wasn\u0027t there any money?\" asked Martin, disappointed. \"Yes, there was a trifle,—a hundred dollars,\" answered his unscrupulous confederate, who was certainly cheating Martin in the most barefaced manner. \"Half of that belongs to me,\" said Martin. \"Of course it does. Do you think I wouldn\u0027t treat you fair?\" \"No,\" said his dupe. \"I know, Mr. Smith, you\u0027re a man of honor.\" \"Of course I am. I\u0027d like to see anybody say I wasn\u0027t. I\u0027ve left everything in the box just as it was, so you might see it was all right.\" He went to the cupboard, and, unlocking it, produced the box, of which he lifted the lid. The certificates of stock were at the bottom. Above them, folded up, was the five-twenty U. S. bond for five hundred dollars, and upon it a small roll of green-backs. \"You see it\u0027s just as I say, Martin,\" said Smith, with an air of frankness. \"There\u0027s the shares that we can\u0027t do anything with, here\u0027s the bond, and there\u0027s the money. Just take and count it, I may have been mistaken in the amount.\" Martin counted the roll of bills, and made out just one hundred dollars. Of course he could not be expected to know that there had been three hundred more, which, together with the other bond, were carefully concealed in his confederate\u0027s breast-pocket. \"Yes, it\u0027s just a hundred dollars,\" he said, after finishing the count. \"Well, take fifty of them, and put in your pocket.\" Martin did so. \"It aint what I expected,\" he said, rather ruefully. \"If I\u0027d knowed there was so little in the box, I wouldn\u0027t have taken it.\" \"Well, it\u0027s better than nothing,\" said Smith, who could afford to be philosophical, having appropriated to himself seven-eighths of the money, and three-fourths of the bonds. \"There\u0027s the bond, you know.\" \"Let me see it.\" Smith extended it to Martin. \"When shall I sell it?\" asked he. \"Not just yet. Wait till the affair blows over a little.\" \"Do you think there\u0027s any danger, then?\" queried Martin, anxiously. \"Not much. Still it\u0027s best to be prudent.\" \"Hadn\u0027t you better sell it yourself?\" \"Suppose I did,\" said Smith. \"I might take the notion to walk off with all the money.\" \"I don\u0027t think you would,\" said Martin, surveying his confederate doubtfully, nevertheless. \"No, I don\u0027t think I would; but if you sell it yourself, you\u0027ll have the affair in your own hands.\" \"But I might walk off with all the money, too,\" said Martin, who thought it a poor rule that didn\u0027t work both ways. \"I don\u0027t think you would,\" said Smith, \"and I\u0027ll tell you why. We belong to a large band, that are bound together by a terrible oath to punish any one guilty of treachery. Suppose you played me false, and did as you say,—though of course I know you don\u0027t mean it,—I wouldn\u0027t give that for your life;\" and he snapped his fingers. \"Don\u0027t!\" said Martin, with a shudder. \"You make me shiver. Of course I didn\u0027t mean anything. I\u0027m on the square.\" \"Certainly, I only told you what would happen to you or me, or any one that was false to the others.\" \"I think I\u0027d rather have you sell the bond,\" said Martin, nervously. \"If I were in your case, I\u0027d be perfectly willing; but the fact is, the brokers know me too well. They suspect me, and they won\u0027t suspect you.\" \"I think I\u0027ve had my share of the risk,\" grumbled Martin. \"I don\u0027t see but I do the work, and you share the profits.\" \"Wasn\u0027t it I that put you up to it?\" demanded Smith. \"Would you ever have thought of it if it hadn\u0027t been for me?\" \"Maybe I wouldn\u0027t. I wish I hadn\u0027t.\" \"You\u0027re a fool, then! Don\u0027t you see it\u0027s turned out all right? Haven\u0027t you got fifty dollars in your pocket, and won\u0027t you have two hundred and fifty more when the bond is sold?\" \"I thought I\u0027d get five thousand,\" said Martin, dissatisfied. \"It seems to me that three hundred dollars is pretty good pay for one morning\u0027s work; but then there are some people that are never satisfied.\" \"It wasn\u0027t the work, it was the danger. I aint at all sure but the boy saw me, and knew who I was. If he did, I\u0027ve got to keep out of the way.\" \"Do you think he did recognize you?\" asked Smith, thoughtfully. \"I\u0027m not sure. I\u0027m afraid he did.\" \"I wish we\u0027d got him in our clutches. But I dare say he was too frightened to tell who it was.\" \"He aint easy frightened,\" said Martin, shaking his head. He understood our hero better than his confederate. \"Well, all is, you must be more careful for a few days. Instead of staying in the city, I\u0027ll send you to Jersey City, Newark, and other places where you won\u0027t be likely to meet him.\" \"That might do,\" said Martin; \"he\u0027s a smart boy, though he\u0027s an undootiful son. He don\u0027t care no more for me than if I was no kith nor kin to him, and he just as lieves see me sent to prison as not.\" \"There\u0027s one thing you haven\u0027t thought of,\" said Smith. \"What\u0027s that?\" \"His employer will most likely think that the boy has stolen the box, or had something to do with its being carried off. As he took him out of the street, he won\u0027t have much confidence in his honesty. I shouldn\u0027t be at all surprised if this undootiful boy of yours, as you call him, found himself locked up in the Tombs, on account of this little affair.\" \"Do you think so?\" said Martin, brightening up at the suggestion. \"I think it more likely than not. If that is the case, of course you won\u0027t be in any danger from him.\" \"That\u0027s so,\" said Martin, cheerfully. \"I hope you\u0027re right. It would be worth something to have that young imp locked up. He wouldn\u0027t put on so many airs after that.\" \"Well, it\u0027s very likely to happen.\" The contemplation of this possibility so raised Martin\u0027s spirits, that, in spite of the disappointment he had experienced in finding the booty so far below what he had anticipated, he became quite cheerful, especially after Smith produced a bottle of whiskey, and asked him to help himself,—an invitation which he did not have occasion to repeat. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3000/82778.html","bookId":301,"book":{"id":301,"title":"Rufus and Rose","description":"简介： In presenting to the public the last volume of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to return his thanks for the generous reception accorded, both by the press and the public, to these stories of street life.
