{"id":40229,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. IN A TRAP.","content":"Our hero\u0027s first impulse, on finding himself entrapped, was to escape. He sprang towards the door, but Martin quickly grasped him by the arm, and forced him back. \"No you don\u0027t!\" he said, with emphasis. \"I want you to stay with me.\" \"Let me go!\" exclaimed Rufus, struggling to escape. \"Sorry I couldn\u0027t oblige you,\" said Martin, with a grin. \"Can\u0027t you stay with your sick father a few days?\" \"You\u0027ve played me a mean trick,\" said Rufus, indignantly. \"What was you walkin\u0027 through this street for?\" asked Martin. \"Wasn\u0027t it because you wanted to see me?\" \"Yes,\" answered our hero. \"Well, you\u0027ve got what you wanted,\" said Martin, smiling maliciously. \"I know\u0027d you\u0027d never find me if I didn\u0027t send out for you. Was there anything partic\u0027lar you wish to say to me?\" \"Yes,\" said Rufus, bluntly. \"I want you to give me back that tin box you stole from me the other day.\" \"What do I know about any tin box?\" asked Martin, not knowing that it had been spoken of by Humpy in the street. \"You needn\u0027t deny it, Mr. Martin. The boy you sent after me told me you took it.\" \"He did, did he?\" said Martin, seeing that he must try another tack. \"Well, s\u0027posin\u0027 I did, what then?\" \"The law may have something to say. You\u0027ll stand a chance of going to Sing Sing for a few years.\" \"You\u0027d have to prove I took it,\" said Martin, uneasily. \"I only told the boy to say so, so\u0027s to get you in here. I read about the robbery in the papers.\" \"I recognized you at the time, and am ready to swear to you,\" said Rufus, firmly. This was rather imprudent, for it made Martin even more determined to prevent our hero\u0027s escape. \"If that\u0027s your game,\" he said, \"I\u0027ll see you don\u0027t get a chance to swear to any lies.\" \"What do you mean to do with me?\" demanded Rufus. \"I aint decided yet,\" said Martin. \"Your health\u0027s so delicate that I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll agree with you to go out in the street.\" \"Are you going to confine me here?\" \"Maybe,\" said his step-father. \"I shan\u0027t charge you nothing for board. Your cheerful company\u0027ll pay me for that.\" \"Mr. Martin,\" said Rufus, \"I\u0027ve got a proposition to make to you.\" \"Go ahead and make it then.\" \"You\u0027ve got yourself into a scrape about that tin box.\" \"I thought you was the one that had got into a scrape,\" said Martin, jocularly. \"So I have; but mine is of a different kind from yours. You run the risk of going to prison.\" \"And you\u0027re in prison already,\" said Martin, with a grin. \"Seems to me I\u0027ve got the best of it so far.\" \"Perhaps you have; but I wouldn\u0027t exchange with you for all that. Now I\u0027ve got a proposition to make.\" \"That\u0027s what you said before.\" \"If you will restore the tin box, and let me go free, I\u0027ll see that you are not arrested for what you\u0027ve done.\" \"You\u0027re very kind,\" said Martin; \"but that won\u0027t pay me for my trouble.\" \"If I\u0027ll get you out of your present danger?\" \"I don\u0027t know about that. S\u0027posin\u0027 I was to do as you say, the first thing you\u0027d do after you got out would be to set the copps on me.\" \"No, I wouldn\u0027t. I\u0027d go to prison first myself.\" This proposition had some effect upon Martin. He realized that he was in danger, and felt that he had been very poorly paid for his risk and trouble. He was inclined to believe Rufus would keep his word, but he knew also that matters had gone too far. Smith, he was sure, would not consent to any such arrangement, and without him he could do nothing. Besides, it was a satisfaction to him to feel that he had Rufus in his power, and he had no desire to lose that advantage by setting him free. Tyrant and bully as he was by nature, he meant to gratify his malice at our hero\u0027s expense. \"I couldn\u0027t do it, Rufus,\" he said. \"There\u0027s another man in it, and he\u0027s got the box.\" Rufus looked sharply at Martin to ascertain if he was speaking the truth. He decided that it was as his step-father stated, and, if this was the case, he would have more than one enemy to deal with. \"Does the other man live here?\" he asked. \"Maybe he does, and maybe he doesn\u0027t.\" \"Who is he?\" \"Maybe it\u0027s the Emperor of Chiny, and maybe it isn\u0027t. What would you give to know?\" \"Not much,\" said Rufus, assuming an indifferent tone. \"You\u0027re the man that took the box,â€”that\u0027s enough for me.\" \"He put me up to it,\" said Martin, unguardedly. \"I thought Martin wasn\u0027t smart enough to plan the robbery himself,\" said Rufus to himself. He resolved to appear indifferent to this information, in the hope of learning more. \"You can settle that among yourselves,\" he said, quietly. \"If you consented to do it, you\u0027re as much to blame as he.\" At this moment Smith, influenced by curiosity, opened the door and entered. \"This is my undootiful son, Mr. Smith,\" said Martin. \"So his name\u0027s Smith,\" thought Rufus. \"I wonder whether it\u0027s his real name, or a false one.\" \"I\u0027m glad to see you, young man,\" said Smith. \"So you\u0027ve called to see your father?\" \"He isn\u0027t my father.\" \"You see how undootiful he is,\" said Martin. \"He won\u0027t own me.\" \"We\u0027ll teach him to be more dutiful before we get through with him,\" said Smith. \"Mr. Smith,\" said Rufus, \"I\u0027m not here of my own accord. I dare say you know that. But as long as I am here, I\u0027d like to ask you if you know anything about a tin box that was taken from me the other day by Mr. Martin.\" \"By your father?\" \"By Mr. Martin,\" said Rufus, determined not to admit the relationship. \"What should I know about it?\" \"Mr. Martin tells me that, though he took it, somebody else set him to do it. I thought you might be the one.\" \"Did you say that?\" demanded Smith, looking angrily at Martin. \"I was only foolin\u0027,\" returned Martin, who began to think he had made a blunder. \"It\u0027s my belief that you\u0027re a fool,\" retorted Smith. \"You\u0027d better be careful what you tell your son. Young man,\" turning to Rufus, \"as to the tin box you speak of, I can tell you nothing. Your father says that he has recovered some property which you stole from him a while since, and I suppose that may be the tin box you refer to.\" \"That isn\u0027t true. It belonged to Mr. Turner, my employer, or rather to a customer of his.\" \"That\u0027s nothing to me. Mr. Martin boards with me, and as long as he pays for his board I don\u0027t want to pry into his affairs. If he has taken a tin box from you, I presume he had a better right to it than you had. Are you going to bring your son down to dinner, Mr. Martin?\" \"I guess he\u0027d better eat his victuals up here,\" said Martin. \"Just as you say. I can send Humpy with them. We shall have dinner in about an hour.\" \"All right; I\u0027ll go down now if my dootiful son can spare me.\" As Rufus did not urge him to stay, Martin left the room with Smith, taking care to lock the door after him. \"What\u0027s the boy\u0027s name?\" asked Smith, abruptly. \"Rufus.\" \"He\u0027s smart. I can tell that by his looks.\" \"Ye-es, he\u0027s smart enough,\" said Martin, hesitatingly; \"but he\u0027s as obstinate as a pig.\" \"Likes to have his own way, eh?\" \"That\u0027s what he does.\" \"He\u0027d make a good boy for our business,\" said Smith, musingly. Martin shook his head. \"It wouldn\u0027t do,\" he said. \"Why not?\" \"He wants to be honest,\" said Martin, contemptuously. \"We couldn\u0027t trust him.\" \"Then there\u0027s only one thing to do.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"We must keep him close. We mustn\u0027t on any account allow him to escape.\" \"I\u0027ll look after that,\" said Martin, nodding. \"I\u0027ve had hard work enough to get hold of him. He won\u0027t get away in a hurry.\" \"If he does, you\u0027ll be arrested.\" \"And you too,\" suggested Martin. \"Why should I?\" \"Didn\u0027t you put me up to taking the box, and haven\u0027t you taken half what was in it?\" \"Look here,\" said Smith, menacingly, \"you\u0027d better stop that. You\u0027ve already told the boy more than you ought. If you are taken through your own carelessness, mind what you are about, and don\u0027t split on me. If you do, it\u0027ll be the worse day\u0027s work you ever did. Imprisonment isn\u0027t the worse thing that can happen to a man.\" Martin understood what his confederate meant, and the intended effect was produced. He began to think that Smith was a desperate man, and capable of murdering him, or instigating his murder, in case of treachery. This made him feel rather uneasy, in spite of his capture of Rufus. Meanwhile, our hero, left to himself, began to examine the apartment in which he was confined. The door had been locked by Martin, as we have already said. This was the only mode of exit from the apartment, except what was afforded by two windows. Rufus walked to them, and looked out. The room was in the back part of the house, and these windows looked out into a back yard. He could see the rear portions of the houses on a parallel street, and speculated as to the chances of escape this way. As the room was only on the second floor, the distance to the ground was not great. He could easily swing off the window-sill without injury. Though he knew it would not be well to attempt escape now when Martin and Smith were doubtless on the lookout, he thought he would open the window softly and take a survey. He tried one window, but could not raise it. He tried the other, with like want of success. He thought at first that the difficulty lay in their sticking, but, on closer examination, he ascertained that both were firmly fastened by nails, which accounted for their being immovable.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3000/82780.html","bookId":301,"book":{"id":301,"title":"Rufus and Rose","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š In presenting to the public the last volume of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to return his thanks for the generous reception accorded, both by the press and the public, to these stories of street life.
