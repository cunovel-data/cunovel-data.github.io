{"id":40234,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. HOW RUFUS GOT BACK.","content":"It happened that Smith espied the man whom he wished to meet, from the car-window, just as it turned into Canal Street. He got out, therefore, and, adjourning to a whiskey saloon, the two discussed a matter of business in which they were jointly interested, and then separated. Thus Smith was enabled to return home sooner than he had anticipated. He little suspected that his prisoner had escaped, as he walked complacently by on the opposite sidewalk. \"It\u0027s lucky I saw him,\" said Humpy. \"He might have nabbed us.\" \"He wouldn\u0027t have nabbed me,\" said Rufus, resolutely. \"He\u0027d have found it hard work to get me back.\" \"He\u0027s stronger than you,\" said Humpy, doubtfully. \"I\u0027d have called a copp, then,\" said Rufus, using his old word for policeman. \"He\u0027ll kill me if he ever gets hold of me,\" said Humpy, shuddering. \"He horsewhipped me yesterday.\" \"Then he\u0027s a brute,\" said Rufus, who could not help feeling a degree of sympathy for the deformed boy, who had done him such good service. \"He never did it before,\" said Humpy. \"That\u0027s what made me turn against him.\" \"And you won\u0027t go back to him?\" \"Never!\" said Humpy, decidedly. \"He\u0027ll know I let you out.\" \"What\u0027s your name?\" asked Rufus, remembering that he had never heard the name of his guide. \"They call me Humpy,\" said the deformed boy, flushing a little. He had got hardened to the name, he thought; but now that Rufus asked him, he answered with a feeling of shame and reluctance. \"Haven\u0027t you another name? I don\u0027t like to call you that.\" \"My name is William Norton, but I\u0027ve most forgot it, it\u0027s so long since anybody ever called me so.\" \"Then I\u0027ll call you so. I like it better than the other. Have you made up your mind what to do, now you\u0027ve left your old place?\" \"Yes, I\u0027m going out West,—to Chicago maybe.\" \"Why do you leave New York?\" \"I want to get away from him,\" said William, indicating his old employer by a backward jerk of his finger. \"If I stay here, he\u0027ll get hold of me.\" \"Perhaps you are right; but you needn\u0027t go so far as Chicago. Philadelphia would do.\" \"He goes there sometimes.\" \"What will you do in Chicago?\" \"I\u0027ll get along. There\u0027s a good many things I can do,—black boots, sell papers, smash baggage, and so on. Besides, I\u0027ll have some money.\" \"The fifty dollars I am to give you?\" \"I\u0027ve got more besides,\" said Humpy, lowering his voice. Looking around cautiously, lest he might be observed, he drew out the calico bag which contained his savings, and showed to Rufus. \"There\u0027s twenty dollars in that,\" he said, jingling the coins with an air of satisfaction. \"That\u0027ll make seventy when you\u0027ve paid me.\" \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve got so much, William. Where did you get it all?\" \"I saved it up. He paid me fifty cents a week, and gave me an extra quarter or so sometimes when he felt good-natured. I saved it all up, and here it is.\" \"When did you begin saving?\" \"Six months ago. I used to spend all my money for oysters and cigars, but somebody told me smokin\u0027 would stop me from growin\u0027, and I gave it up.\" \"You did right. I used to smoke sometimes; but I stopped. It don\u0027t do a boy any good.\" \"Are you rich?\" asked Humpy. \"No. What makes you ask?\" \"You wear nice clo\u0027es. Besides, you are goin\u0027 to pay me fifty dollars.\" \"I\u0027m worth five hundred dollars,\" said Rufus, with satisfaction. \"That\u0027s a good deal,\" said Humpy, enviously. \"I\u0027d feel rich if I had so much.\" \"You\u0027ll be worth a good deal more some time, I hope.\" \"I hope so, but it\u0027ll be a good while.\" While this conversation had been going on, the boys had been walking leisurely. But Rufus, who was anxious to restore the tin box as soon as possible, now proposed to ride. \"We\u0027ll jump aboard the next car, William,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll pay the fare.\" \"Where are you goin\u0027?\" \"To Mr. Turner\u0027s office, to return the box.\" \"He won\u0027t think I had anything to do with stealin\u0027 it, will he?\" \"No; I\u0027ll take care he doesn\u0027t.\" They jumped on board the next car, and before long reached the termination of the car route, at the junction of Vesey Street and Broadway. \"Where\u0027s the place you\u0027re goin\u0027 to?\" asked Humpy. \"In Wall Street. We\u0027ll be there in ten minutes.\" The boys proceeded down Broadway, and in rather less than ten minutes, Rufus, followed by Humpy, entered his employer\u0027s office. His arrival created a sensation. \"I am glad to see you back, Rufus,\" said Mr. Turner, coming forward, and shaking his hand cordially. The clerks left their desks, and greeted him in a friendly manner. \"I\u0027ve brought back the tin box, Mr. Turner,\" said Rufus. \"I told you I\u0027d get it back, and I have,\" he added, with pardonable pride. \"How did you recover it? Tell me all about it.\" \"This boy helped me,\" said Rufus, directing attention to Humpy, who had kept himself in the background. \"But for him I should still be a prisoner, closely confined and guarded.\" \"He shall be rewarded,\" said the banker. \"What is his name?\" \"William Morton.\" Mr. Turner took the boy\u0027s hand kindly, dirty though it was, and said, \"I will bear you in mind, my lad,\" in a tone which made Humpy, who before felt awkward and uncertain of a welcome, quite at his ease. \"Now for your story, Rufus,\" said the banker. \"I am curious to hear your adventures. So you were a prisoner?\" \"Yes, sir,\" answered Rufus, and forthwith commenced a clear and straightforward account of his experiences, which need not be repeated. He wound up by saying that he had promised Humpy fifty dollars in return for his assistance. \"Your promise shall be kept,\" said Mr. Turner. \"I will pay you the money now, if you wish,\" he added, turning to Humpy. \"I would advise you to put most of it in a savings-bank, as you are liable to be robbed, or to lose it.\" \"I\u0027ll put it in as soon as I get to Chicago,\" said Humpy. \"Are you going there?\" Rufus explained why the boy wished to leave New York. \"Do you want to start at once?\" \"I\u0027d like to.\" \"Then, Rufus, I think you had better go with him, and buy his ticket. You may also buy him a suit of clothes at my expense.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said Humpy, gratefully. \"If you can spare me, Mr. Turner,\" said Rufus, \"I would like to go home first, and let them know that I am safe.\" \"Certainly. That reminds me that a lady—was it your aunt?—was in the office an hour ago, asking for you.\" \"It was Miss Manning.\" \"I promised to let you go home when you appeared, and I think you had better do so at once to relieve the anxiety of your friends.\" \"Thank you, sir;\" and Rufus was about to leave the office, when a thought occurred to him, and he turned back. \"I didn\u0027t think to tell you that the money had been taken out,\" he said. \"So I supposed. I will open the box.\" The box being opened, it was discovered also that the government bonds were missing. \"That\u0027s too much to lose,\" said the banker. \"What is the number of the house in which you were confined?\" Rufus was able to give it, having judged that it would be wanted. \"I shall give information to the police, and see what can be done towards recovering the bonds.\" \"Shall I go to the police-office for you, Mr. Turner?\" \"No, you can go home at once. Then accompany this boy to a clothing-store, and afterwards to the Erie Railroad Station, where you may buy him a through ticket to Chicago. Here is the necessary money;\" and Mr. Turner placed a roll of bills in the hands of our hero. \"Am I to buy the railroad ticket, also, out of this?\" \"Yes. William shall have his fifty dollars clear to start on when he gets there.\" Miss Manning had nearly got through with the morning lessons, when a quick step was heard ascending the stairs two or three at a time. Rose let drop the arithmetic, from which she had been reciting, and exclaimed, in glad excitement, \"That\u0027s Rufie, I know it is!\" The door opened, and she was proved to be correct. \"Where\u0027ve you been, Rufie?\" exclaimed his sister, throwing her arms around his neck. \"Mr. Martin carried me off, Rosy.\" \"I knew he would; but you said you was too big.\" \"He was smarter than I thought for. Sit down, Rosy, and I\u0027ll tell you all about it. Were you anxious about me, Miss Manning?\" \"Yes, Rufus. I don\u0027t mind saying now that I was, though I would not confess it to Rose, who fretted enough for you without.\" So the story had to be told again, and was listened to, I need not say, with breathless interest. \"You won\u0027t let him catch you again, will you, Rufie?\" said Rose, anxiously, when it was finished. \"Not if I know myself, Rosy,\" answered Rufus. \"That can\u0027t be done twice. But I\u0027ve got to be going. I\u0027ve got ever so much to do. I\u0027ll be back to dinner at six.\" He hastened downstairs, and rejoined Humpy, who had been waiting for him in the street.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3000/82785.html","bookId":301,"book":{"id":301,"title":"Rufus and Rose","description":"简介： In presenting to the public the last volume of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to return his thanks for the generous reception accorded, both by the press and the public, to these stories of street life.
