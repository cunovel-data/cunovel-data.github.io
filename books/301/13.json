{"id":40222,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XII. MARTIN\u0027S LUCK TURNS.","content":"Martin continued to watch for an hour or two, sitting in a door-way. At length he was forced to conclude that Rufus had given him the slip, and this tended by no means to sweeten his temper. In fact, his position was not altogether a pleasant one. It was now past midnight, and, having no money, he saw no other way than to spend the night in the street. Besides he was hungry, and that was a complaint which was likely to get worse instead of better. As for Rufus, Martin had never before seen him so well dressed, and it seemed clear that he was prospering. \"He\u0027s an ungrateful young rascal,\" muttered Martin,—\"livin\u0027 in ease and comfort, while I am left to starve in the street!\" It would have been rather hard to tell what Rufus had to be grateful for, unless for the privilege which he had enjoyed for some time of helping support his step-father; but Martin persuaded himself that he was ungrateful and undutiful, and grew indignant over his fancied wrongs, as he lay back in discomfort on the stone step which he had selected as his resting-place. The night passed slowly away, and when the morning light came Martin got up very stiff and sore, and more hungry than ever, and began to wonder where he was likely to get any breakfast. Begging seemed to him, on the whole, the easiest way of getting along; but it was too early for that. After a while, however, the street began to be peopled, and he walked up to a gentleman who was approaching, and, assuming a look which he thought indicative of wretchedness, whined out, \"Would you be willing to help a poor man, sir?\" The gentleman stopped. \"So you are poor?\" he said. \"Yes,\" said Martin, \"I have been very unfortunate.\" \"Why don\u0027t you work?\" \"I can\u0027t find any work to do,\" answered Martin. \"Haven\u0027t you got any friends to help you?\" \"They\u0027ve all turned against me,\" said Martin. \"Even my own children have turned me out of the house to shift for myself.\" \"How old are your children?\" asked the other. Martin hesitated, for this question was a little embarrassing. \"One of them is sixteen,\" he said. \"A son?\" \"Yes.\" \"Did you support him, or did he support you?\" was the natural inquiry. \"I supported him,\" said Martin; \"but he\u0027s an undootiful, ungrateful scamp, and—\" \"Then it appears that he has relieved you from taking care of him, and you have only yourself to provide for. It appears to me that you ought to get along better than before.\" \"If I could get any work.\" \"What sort of work do you want to do?\" \"If I had a few dollars I could set up in some light business.\" \"You will have to apply elsewhere for the money, my friend,\" said the gentleman. \"To be frank with you, your appearance doesn\u0027t speak in your favor;\" and he walked on. \"That\u0027s the way the rich and prosperous treat the poor,\" soliloquized Martin, feeling that the whole world was in a conspiracy against him. Those who undertake to live without work are very apt to arrive at such conclusions. Martin concluded, on the whole, that he wouldn\u0027t refer to being turned out of his house next time, as it might lead to embarrassing questions. He approached another gentleman, and began with the same appeal for assistance. \"What\u0027s the matter? Can\u0027t you work?\" was the reply. \"I\u0027ve had a severe fit of sickness,\" said Martin, forcing a cough; \"and I\u0027m very feeble. I haint had anything to eat for twenty-four hours, and I\u0027ve got a wife and five little children dependent on me.\" \"If that don\u0027t bring something,\" thought Martin, \"nothing will.\" \"Where do you live?\" \"No. 578 Twenty-Fourth Street,\" answered Martin, glibly. Now the individual addressed was a gentleman of leisure, of a philanthropic turn of mind, and one who frequently visited the poor at their homes. Martin\u0027s story seemed pitiful, and he concluded to inquire into it. \"I\u0027m sorry for you,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll go round with you and see your family, and see what can be done for them.\" This was just what Martin did not want. As the family he spoke of was entirely imaginary, it would only result in exposure and disappointment. Yet he knew not how to refuse. \"I\u0027m much obliged to you, sir,\" he said. \"I\u0027m afraid it would be too much trouble.\" \"No, I\u0027ve nothing pressing for an hour. I always like to relieve the unfortunate.\" \"What shall I do?\" thought Martin, as he walked by the side of the benevolent stranger. At length an idea struck him. \"It isn\u0027t everybody that would be willing to risk going with me,\" he said. \"Why not?\" \"They\u0027d be afraid to come.\" \"Why? What danger is there?\" \"My third child is \u0027most dead with the small-pox,\" answered Martin, with a very dejected look. \"Good heavens! and I might have carried the infection home to my children,\" exclaimed the stranger, in excitement. \"Then you won\u0027t go with me?\" asked Martin. \"Here,\" said the gentleman, producing fifty cents, \"here\u0027s a little money. Take it, and I hope it\u0027ll do you good.\" \"I reckon it will,\" thought Martin, as he took the money. \"It\u0027ll buy me some breakfast and a couple of cigars. That\u0027s a pretty good idea, havin\u0027 a child sick with the small-pox. I\u0027ll know what to do next time anybody wants to go home with me.\" As soon as Martin found himself in funds he took measures to satisfy his appetite. He really had not eaten anything since the middle of the day previous, and felt that he could do justice to a substantial breakfast. He walked along until he came to a restaurant where the prices seemed to be reasonable, and went in. Seating himself at one of the tables, he gave his order, and presently a plate of meat and cup of coffee were placed before him. To these he devoted himself with such vigor that they were soon despatched. Still Martin\u0027s appetite was not satisfied. Much as he wanted a cigar, the claims of hunger were imperative, and he ordered breakfast to the extent of his resources. Opposite him at the table sat a man of middle age, with bushy whiskers, and a scar on his left cheek. He wore a loose sack coat, and a velvet vest. His thick, bunchy fingers displayed two large, showy rings, set with stones, probably imitation. He finished his breakfast before Martin, but still retained his seat, and watched him rather attentively. Martin was too busily engaged to notice the scrutiny to which he was subjected. After sitting a while the stranger drew out a cigar, and, lighting it, began to smoke. This drew Martin\u0027s attention. As the flavor of the cigar, which was a very good one, reached his nostrils, he began to feel a regret that he had not reserved a part of his funds for the purchase of a cigar. His opposite neighbor observed his look, and, for a reason which will appear, saw fit to gratify Martin\u0027s desire. \"I don\u0027t like to smoke alone,\" he said, drawing another cigar from his pocket. \"Won\u0027t you have a cigar?\" \"Thank you,\" said Martin, eagerly accepting it. \"You\u0027re very kind.\" \"Don\u0027t mention it. So you like to smoke. Light it by mine.\" \"Yes,\" said Martin; \"I like smoking; but I\u0027m a poor man, and I can\u0027t afford to smoke as often as I want to.\" \"Been unfortunate?\" said the stranger, suggestively. \"Yes,\" said Martin, \"luck\u0027s been ag\u0027inst me. I couldn\u0027t get work to do, and my family turned ag\u0027inst me because I was poor. I\u0027ve got two children living on the fat of the land, but one of \u0027em refused me a dollar last night, and left me to sleep in the streets.\" \"That\u0027s bad,\" said the other. \"He\u0027s an undootiful son,\" said Martin. \"Better luck by and by,\" said the stranger. \"Luck\u0027ll turn, it\u0027s likely.\" \"I wish it would turn pretty quick,\" said Martin. \"I\u0027ve spent my last cent for breakfast, and I don\u0027t know where I\u0027m to get my dinner.\" \"The world owes every man a living,\" remarked the stranger, sententiously. \"So it does,\" said Martin. \"I don\u0027t see what\u0027s the use of bein\u0027 born at all, if you\u0027re goin\u0027 to starve afterwards.\" \"Very true. Now I\u0027ll tell you what my principle is.\" \"What is it?\" asked Martin, who was becoming interested in his companion. \"If the world owes me a living, and isn\u0027t disposed to pay up promptly, I think it\u0027s perfectly right for me to collect the debt any way I can.\" \"So do I,\" said Martin, though he didn\u0027t exactly see the other\u0027s drift. \"For instance, if I was starving, and my next neighbor was a baker, and had plenty of bread, the law of self-preservation justifies me in taking a loaf.\" \"Without payin\u0027 for it?\" \"Yes; if I haven\u0027t got any money to pay. I\u0027m entitled to my share of food, and if others keep it from me, I have a right to help myself, haven\u0027t I?\" \"That\u0027s so,\" said Martin; \"only it\u0027s dangerous.\" \"Of course there is a risk about it; but then there\u0027s a risk in starvin\u0027, isn\u0027t there?\" \"I should think there was,\" said Martin. \"I thought we should agree pretty well. Now tell me what you propose to do. Perhaps I can assist you.\" \"I don\u0027t know what to do,\" said Martin. \"I can\u0027t get work. What do you do?\" \"I\u0027m in business,\" said the stranger, evasively. \"Couldn\u0027t you give me a chance,—that is, if it aint hard work? I aint so strong as I was once, and I aint fit for hard work.\" \"Well, perhaps I may be able to do something for you,\" said the stranger. \"If you\u0027ll walk with me a little way, we\u0027ll smoke another cigar, and talk it over. What do you say?\" Of course Martin accepted the proposal with alacrity. He did not want to go back to his work as a carpenter, having lost all relish for honest industry. He would rather beg, or do anything else for a living. He had a very indefinite idea of the nature of the proposal which was coming, but, whatever it might be, he was not likely to be shocked at it. \"Here, give me your check,\" said the stranger. He paid, therefore, for Martin\u0027s breakfast as well as his own, leaving that gentleman\u0027s fifty cents intact. Martin was not used to such attention, and appreciated it. For the first time he began to think that his luck had really turned. The two went out into the street together, and were soon engaged in earnest conversation. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3000/82773.html","bookId":301,"book":{"id":301,"title":"Rufus and Rose","description":"简介： In presenting to the public the last volume of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to return his thanks for the generous reception accorded, both by the press and the public, to these stories of street life.
