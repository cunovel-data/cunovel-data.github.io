{"id":40228,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. RUFUS ENTRAPPED.","content":"\"Now,\" said Rufus to himself on the morning succeeding the robbery, \"I\u0027ve got a week to recover that box. How shall I go about it?\" This was a question easier asked than answered. Martin being the thief, the first thing, of course, was to find him; and Rufus had considerable hopes of encountering him in the street some day. Should this be the case, he might point him out to a policeman, and have him arrested at once; but this would not recover the box. Probably it was concealed at Martin\u0027s boarding-house, and this it was that Rufus was anxious to find. He decided, therefore, whenever he got on the track of his step-father, to follow him cautiously until he ascertained where he lodged. He walked the street with his eyes about him all day, but did not catch a glimpse of Martin. The fact was, the latter was at Newark, having been sent there by his employers with a supply of counterfeit money to dispose of, so that our hero\u0027s search was of course fruitless, and so he was obliged to report to Mr. Turner the next morning. \"Probably he is in hiding,\" said his employer. \"I don\u0027t think you have much chance of meeting him for a few days to come.\" \"I should like to try,\" said Rufus. \"He won\u0027t be content to hide long.\" \"I have notified the banks and railroad companies of the robbery,\" said Mr. Turner; \"so that it will be impossible to sell the shares. After a while, should we fail to recover them, they will grant us duplicate certificates. I have advertised, also, the numbers of the bonds; and, if an attempt is made to dispose of them, the thief will find himself in trouble. So the loss is reduced to four hundred dollars.\" \"That is too much to lose,\" said Rufus. \"That is true; but we are lucky to get off so cheap.\" \"I hope to get back some of that,\" said our hero, stoutly. \"Did it ever strike you that there might be some risk encountering this man? If he is driven to bay he may become dangerous.\" \"I don\u0027t think of the danger, Mr. Turner,\" said Rufus. \"I lost that box, and it is my duty to recover it if I can, danger or no danger.\" Mr. Turner secretly admired the pluck of Rufus; but he was not a man given to compliments, so he only said, quietly, \"Well, Rufus, you shall have the week I promised you. I have no doubt you will do your best. I shall not be surprised, however, if you fail.\" So Rufus entered upon his second day\u0027s search. He went up Chatham Street, and explored most of the streets intersecting it, visiting many places which he remembered as former haunts of his step-father. But he was quite off the track here. Martin\u0027s employment now was on the other side of the city, near the North River, and he had no longer occasion to visit his old haunts. Besides, he had again been sent over to New Jersey, and did not get back to the city at all till late in the afternoon. The next day Martin complained of headache, and was permitted to remain at home. He did not think it prudent to be out during the day; but easily solaced himself in his confinement with whiskey and cigars, of which he had laid in a good supply. He was sitting in his shirt-sleeves at the front window, looking through the blinds, which were always closed, when his eyes lighted on Rufus passing on the opposite side of the street. \"He\u0027s looking for me,\" exclaimed Martin to himself, observing that Rufus was looking about him as he walked. \"Who\u0027s looking for you?\" asked his confederate, Smith, who happened just then to enter the room. \"My undootiful son. Look, there he is,\" said Martin, nervously. \"I wonder if he has heard about my living here.\" Smith went to the window, and looked out. \"He looks resolute and determined,\" said Smith. \"We must pull his teeth.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean we must put it out of his power to do you harm.\" \"How are we going to do that?\" \"Wait a minute and I\u0027ll tell you.\" Smith left the room hastily, and after a brief interval returned. \"I think I\u0027ll fetch it,\" he said. \"What have you done?\" asked Martin. \"I\u0027ve sent Humpy to follow your son. He\u0027s to carry him a message from you.\" \"What do you mean?\" asked Martin, alarmed. \"Don\u0027t be afraid. It\u0027s all right.\" \"But I don\u0027t understand it. I didn\u0027t send any message. What was it?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you. If I\u0027m not mistaken Humpy will bring your son back with him, so that I shall have the pleasure of reuniting parent and child.\" \"You don\u0027t mean to say you are going to bring Rufus here?\" said Martin, his lower jaw falling. \"You aint going to betray me, are you?\" \"Stuff and nonsense! What are you thinking of? All you need understand is, that the boy is getting dangerous. He is following you round as if he meant something, and that must be stopped. I mean to get him into the house, but I don\u0027t mean to part company with him very soon.\" Smith here briefly detailed the instructions which he had given to his errand-boy. Martin listened with much satisfaction. \"What a head you\u0027ve got!\" he said admiringly. \"I\u0027m generally ready for an emergency,\" remarked Smith, complacently. \"You\u0027ve got to get up early in the morning to get ahead of me.\" We must now follow Smith\u0027s messenger, and we shall ascertain that gentleman\u0027s plan. Humpy was a boy of sixteen, very short, in fact almost a dwarf, and, as his name implies, disfigured by a hump. He was sharp, however, and secretive, and, though he could not help understanding the character of the men who employed him, was not likely to betray them. He had a pride in deserving the confidence which he saw was reposed in him. After receiving the instructions of his principal, he crossed the street, and followed Rufus at a little distance, being particular to keep him in sight. Our hero turned a corner, and so did he. He then quickened his pace and came up with him. \"Was you a-lookin\u0027 for anybody in particular?\" he said. \"What makes you ask?\" said Rufus, facing round upon him. \"Maybe I could help you.\" \"Perhaps you know who I am after,\" said Rufus, looking at him steadily. \"You\u0027re looking for a man named Martin, aint you?\" \"Do you know where I can find him?\" asked Rufus, eagerly. \"Yes, I do. He sent me after you.\" \"He sent you!\" repeated our hero, hardly believing his ears. \"Yes; he wants to see you.\" \"What does he want to see me for?\" asked Rufus, inclined to be suspicious. \"There\u0027s something he\u0027s got of yours that he wants to return,\" said Humpy, in a low voice, looking around cautiously. Rufus was more and more astonished. Was it possible that Martin\u0027s conscience troubled him, and that he wanted to make restitution? He could hardly believe this, knowing what he did of his step-father. Martin was about the last man he would have suspected of being troubled in any such way. \"Yes, he has got something of mine,\" he said aloud. \"Does he want to return it?\" \"Yes, he\u0027s sorry he took it. He\u0027s afraid you\u0027ll set the copps on him.\" \"So he\u0027s frightened,\" thought Rufus. This seemed to throw light on the new phase of affairs. He had never regarded his step-father as very brave, and now concluded that he was alarmed about the consequences of the theft. \"If he\u0027ll return what he took, all right,\" said Rufus, venturing to make this promise on his own responsibility; \"he shan\u0027t be touched. Where is he?\" \"Not far off,\" said Humpy. \"Tell him to bring it to me, and I\u0027ll give my word not to have him arrested.\" \"He can\u0027t come.\" \"Why can\u0027t he?\" \"He\u0027s sick.\" \"Where?\" \"In a house near by. He wants you to come and see him.\" Rufus hesitated. \"What\u0027s the matter with him?\" he asked. \"He caught a cold, and is threatened with a fever,\" said the boy, glibly. \"If you want to see him, I\u0027ll lead you where he is.\" \"All right! Go ahead!\" said Rufus, thoroughly deceived by the boy\u0027s plausible story. \"You\u0027ll promise not to set the copps on him, after you\u0027ve got the box?\" said Humpy. \"Yes, I promise.\" \"Then follow me.\" Rufus followed, congratulating himself that things were coming out satisfactorily. He had no hesitation in making the promise he did, for he felt sure that he would be sustained by his employer. At any rate, he determined that, having pledged his word to Martin, nothing should make him break it. Humpy stumped along, followed by Rufus. They turned the corner again, and the boy guided him at once to the counterfeiter\u0027s den. \"He\u0027s in there,\" said Humpy, with a jerk of his forefinger. \"Come along!\" He mounted the steps, and opened the door, which had been left unlocked. \"He\u0027s upstairs,\" said Humpy. \"Come up.\" Rufus, without suspicion, followed his humpbacked guide up the narrow staircase. They had scarcely reached the top, when Smith, coming out of a room on the floor below, locked the outer door, and put the key in his pocket. This Rufus did not see, or it would have aroused his suspicion. The boy opened the door of a chamber at the head of the staircase. \"Go in there,\" he said. Rufus entered, and looked around him, but saw no one. He did not have to wait long. A step was heard at the door, and James Martin entered the room, apparently in perfect health. \"I\u0027m glad to see you, Rufus,\" he said with a triumphant grin. \"You\u0027ve been such an undootiful son that I didn\u0027t much expect you\u0027d come to see your sick father.\" Rufus sprang to his feet in dismay. The whole plot flashed upon him at once, and he realized that he had walked into a trap with his eyes wide open.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3000/82779.html","bookId":301,"book":{"id":301,"title":"Rufus and Rose","description":"简介： In presenting to the public the last volume of the Ragged Dick Series, the author desires to return his thanks for the generous reception accorded, both by the press and the public, to these stories of street life.
