{"id":83464,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"47 \"Here ya go,\" the cab driver said, and pulled to the curb. \"You sure this is where you want to get out?\" \"Yes sir,\" Billy told him; at least he thought it was the place. A crooked sign said Cresta Street, and the address on the small brownstone building was 1212. Across the street was a sad-looking little park with a rusty swing set and a few drooping trees; set around the park were other brownstone buildings and old two- story houses, many of which looked empty. The larger buildings of downtown Chicago loomed in the distance, filtered by gray haze. There was a small round peephole in the door, and for a moment Billy felt himself being watched. Then locks began to click open - one, two, and three. He had a sudden urge to run all the way back to the Greyhound bus station, but he stood his ground. The door opened, and standing within was a young girl, perhaps sixteen or seventeen. She had long black hair that hung almost to her waist, and Billy thought she looked Spanish. Her eyes were pretty and alert, but there was a trace of sadness in them. She glanced at his suitcase. \"Yes?\" \"Uh . . . this must not be the right place. I thought this was the Hillburn Institute?\" She nodded. \"Well ... my name\u0027s Billy Creekmore, and I\u0027m here to see Dr. Hillburn.\" He fumbled in his back pocket for the envelope and held it out to her. The girl said, \"Come in,\" and then locked the door behind him. The interior was a pleasant surprise. Dark wood paneling gleamed with oil and polish. There were clean rugs on the shining hardwood floor, and an abundance of green plants added a welcoming touch. The tempting aroma of good food wafted in the air. A staircase ascended to the second level, and just to the left of the front door, in a high-ceilinged parlor, a half-dozen people both young and old watched television, read, or played checkers. Billy\u0027s entrance caused a pause in their activities. \"I\u0027m Anita,\" the girl told him. \"You can leave your suitcase down here, if you like. Mr Pearlman,\" she said, addressing one of the men in the parlor. \"It\u0027s your turn to help in the kitchen today.\" \"Oh. Right.\" The man put aside his Reader\u0027s Digest and went off through a hallway. \"Follow me, please.\" Anita took Billy upstairs, through a series of well-kept dormitory-like rooms. There were doors marked Testing Lab 1, Audio-Visual, Conference Room, Research Lab I. The building was very quiet, with pale green linoleum floors and tiled ceilings. Billy glimpsed other people moving about, several of them wearing white lab smocks. He saw a young woman about his own age coming out of a testing lab, and he felt a quick spark of attraction as their gazes met and held. She was wearing jeans and a blue sweater, and Billy saw that her eyes were different colors: one was a pale blue, the other a strange deep green. The young woman looked away first. Then Anita led him around a corner to a door marked Dr. Hillburn, Ph.D., Director. Billy could hear a muffled voice within. The girl knocked on the door and waited. A moment passed. Then: \"Come in.\" It was a woman\u0027s voice, carrying an inflection of annoyance. Dr. Hillburn was sitting behind a battered desk in a small office cluttered with books and papers. The beige-colored walls were adorned with framed certificates and brass plaques, and a window looked out over the Cresta Street park. A green-shaded lamp burned atop the desk, which also held a blotter, a metal can with a collection of pencils and pens, and several pictures of people Billy assumed were her children and husband. Her hand was clamped around a telephone receiver. \"No,\" she said firmly. \"I can\u0027t accept that. The grant was promised us last year and I\u0027ll fight for it right up to the capital, if I have to. I don\u0027t care that all the funds are tied up, and I don\u0027t believe that anyway! Am I just supposed to shut down everything and go out on the street? God knows we\u0027re almost on the street as it is!\" She glanced up and motioned for Anita to close the door \"Tell the esteemed senator that I was promised matching funds, dollar-for-dollar. No! We\u0027ve cut our staff down to a skeleton crew already! Ed, just tell him that I won\u0027t stand for any more foolishness. I\u0027ll expect to hear from you by tomorrow afternoon. Good-bye.\" She put the receiver down and shook her head. \"It\u0027s getting so deep over in Springfield you need waders to get through! Do you know what\u0027s ahead of us on the budget agenda, Anita? Consideration of a grant for a study of litter patterns on the north beach! I ask them for fifteen thousand dollars to keep our programs going for another year, and - \" Her clear gray eyes narrowed. \"Who are you, young man?\" \"My name is Billy Creekmore. You people sent me this letter.\" He stepped forward and handed her the envelope. \"Alabama?\" Dr. Hillburn said, with obvious surprise. \"You\u0027re a long way from home, aren\u0027t you?\" She was a fragile-looking woman in a white lab coat, her eyes deeply set, alert, and very intelligent. Billy thought she was probably in her late forties or early fifties. Her dark brown hair, threaded with silver, was cut short and brushed back from her high, furrowed forehead. Though she had a gentle appearance, the sound of her voice on that telephone told Billy she could spit nails if angered. Dr. Hillburn looked up at him for a moment after reading the letter. \"Yes, we sent you this some time ago. I think I recall the correspondence we got from this friend of yours, Mr Merkle. Anita, will you do me a favor please? Ask Max to go through the M files and bring me the letters from Mr. Reginald Merkle.\" She spelled out the name, and then Anita left. \"Now. What can I do for you, Mr. Creekmore?\" \"I\u0027ve . . . come because your letter asked me to.\" \"I expected a reply by mail, not a visit. And besides, that was some time ago. Are you here in Chicago with your family?\" \"No, ma\u0027am. I\u0027m here alone.\" \"Oh? Where are you staying, then?\" Billy paused, smelling disaster. \"Staying? Well, I . . . left my suitcase downstairs. I thought I\u0027d be staying here.\" Dr. Hillburn was silent; she nodded and spread her hands before her on the blotter \"Young man,\" she said, \"this is not a hotel. This is a workshop and research center. The people you probably saw downstairs, and those in the labs, have been invited here after long consultation. I know nothing about you, and to be perfectly honest I can\u0027t even recall why we wrote you in the first place. We write hundreds of people who don\u0027t answer us. Our labs certainly aren\u0027t as well equipped as those at Duke University and Berkeley, but we have to make do on the budget we get from the University of Chicago and small grants. That budget is hardly enough to continue our tests and research on the individuals we select; and certainly there\u0027s no room here for someone off the street.\" \"I\u0027m not here off the street!\" Billy protested. \"I\u0027ve come a long way!\" \"Of course you have, young man. But I\u0027m saying that . . .\" She looked up as a middle-aged man in horn-rimmed glasses and a lab jacket brought in a file folder containing several letters. \"Thank you, Max,\" she told the man, and when he\u0027d gone she put on a pair of reading spectacles and took several letters from the folder Billy recognized Dr. Mirakle\u0027s spiky handwriting. \"What kind of place is this?\" Billy asked her. \"What goes on here?\" \"Pardon? Don\u0027t you know?\" She glanced up at him. \"The Hillburn Institute is a death survival studies clinic, sponsored in part by the University of Chicago. But as I say, we . . .\" She trailed off, engrossed in something she was reading. \"What do those people downstairs do?\" \"They . . . they\u0027ve had experiences with manifestations or spirit controls.\" Dr. Hillburn looked up from the letters and pushed the spectacles up onto her forehead. \"Young man,\" she said quietly, \"you evidently left your friend Mr Merkle deeply impressed. The experiences he\u0027s written down here are . . . quite interesting.\" She paused, returned the letters to the folder, and said, \"Sit down, won\u0027t you?\" Billy took a chair in front of her desk. Dr. Hillburn swiveled her chair around to stare through the window at the park, her face illuminated by pale gray light. She took her glasses off and put them in her jacket pocket. \"Young man,\" she said. \"What do you think of our city?\" \"Well, it\u0027s noisy,\" he replied. \"And everybody\u0027s running around so fast.\" He didn\u0027t tell her that he\u0027d seen the black aura twice - once clinging to an elderly black man on the bus and once surrounding a young girl a few blocks away from the bus station. \"Have you ever been this far away from home before?\" \"No, ma\u0027am.\" \"Then you must feel the ability you have - whatever it is - is very special. Special enough to leave Alabama and come such a distance? Why did you come here, Mr Creekmore? And I\u0027m not talking about the letter. Why did you come?\" She turned toward him again, her gaze sharp and watchful. \"Because ... my friend, Dr Mirakle, said I should. And because my mother wanted me to. And . . . maybe because I didn\u0027t know where else to go. I want to understand more of why I\u0027m like I am. I want to know why I see things that other people don\u0027t. Like the black auras, and the entities that look like mist and carry so much pain, and the shape changer. My mother could see the same things, and her mother before her . . . and it\u0027s likely that my son or daughter will be able to, as well. I want to know as much as I can about myself. If I\u0027m in the wrong place for that, tell me now and I\u0027ll leave.\" Dr. Hillburn had been observing and listening to him carefully. She was a trained psychiatrist as well as a parapsychologist with two books on death survival studies to her credit, and she\u0027d been looking for telltale signs of emotional instability: inappropriate gestures or grins, facial tics, a general irritability or melancholia. She sensed in Billy Creekmore only a genuine desire for self-knowledge. \"Did you think, young man, that you could just present yourself on our doorsteps and we would offer easy answers for all your questions? No. I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s not to be the case. As I say, this is a workshop; a damned difficult workshop, I might add. If there\u0027s any learning to be done, we learn together. But everything has to be verified through extensive tests and experiments. We don\u0027t deal in trickery here, and I\u0027ve seen enough psychic fakers in my lifetime. Some of them have sat where you\u0027re sitting now. But sooner or later their tricks fail them. \"I don\u0027t know anything about you, except from what I\u0027ve read in these letters. As far as I know, you don\u0027t understand a thing about death survival research. You may have a psi ability - though I\u0027m not saying I\u0027m convinced you do - but as far as I\u0027m concerned it may only be a figment of your imagination. You may be a publicity hound. You may even want to disrupt the work we\u0027re trying to do here, though God knows we have enough disruptions. Do you believe you can communicate with the dead, young man?\" \"Yes. I can.\" \"That remains to be seen. I\u0027m a born skeptic, Mr. Creekmore. If you say a traffic light\u0027s red, I\u0027ll say it\u0027s purple, just for the sake of an interesting argument.\" Her eyes had taken on a shine. \"If I decide you\u0027re worth being here, you might rue the day you ever walked through the gate. I\u0027ll throw every test I can think of at you. I\u0027ll take your brain apart and put it back together again, more or less as it was. In two or three days you\u0027ll hate me, but I\u0027m used to that. You\u0027ll have a room the size of a closet to sleep in, and you\u0027ll be expected to work around here like everyone else. It\u0027s no free ride. Sound like fun?\" \"No.\" \"Now you\u0027ve got the idea!\" She smiled cautiously. \"Tomorrow morning at eight o\u0027clock you\u0027ll be right here, telling me your life story. I want to hear about your mother, and the black auras and the entities and . . . what was it? A shape changer? Indeed. Dinner\u0027s in fifteen minutes, and I hope you like Polish sausage. Why don\u0027t you go get your suitcase?\" Billy rose from his chair, feeling confused about the whole thing. It was still at the back of his mind that he should leave this place, and he had enough money for a return ticket home. But he\u0027d come this far, and he could stick out whatever was in store for him for at least three days. He didn\u0027t know whether to thank the woman or curse her, so he left without saying a word. Dr. Hillburn looked at her wristwatch. She was already late getting home, and her husband would be waiting. But she took the time to read Merkle\u0027s letters again. A pulse of excitement had quickened within her. Is this boy from Alabama the one? she asked herself - the same question she asked when any new subject came to the institute. Is Billy Creekmore the one who\u0027ll show proof positive of life after death? She had no way of knowing, but she could hope. After a moment of reflection, she stood up and took her coat from a rack beside the desk. 48 Wayne Falconer\u0027s scream cracked the silence that had fallen over the Krepsin estate. It was just after two o\u0027clock in the morning. When George Hodges reached Wayne\u0027s bedroom - one of the few rooms in the strange house that had windows - he found Niles already there, pressing a cold washcloth to Wayne\u0027s forehead. Wayne was curled up on the bed, his eyes feverish with fear. Niles was still dressed as if he\u0027d just stepped out of a business meeting. \"A nightmare,\" Niles explained. \"I was walking along the hall when I heard him. He was just about to tell me what it was, weren\u0027t you, Wayne?\" Henry Bragg came in, rubbing his eyes. \"Who screamed? Wayne? What the hell\u0027s . . .\" \"Wayne\u0027s fine,\" Niles said. \"Tell me your dream, and then I\u0027ll get you something for that headache.\" Hodges didn\u0027t like the sound of that. Had Wayne gone through his Percodan and codeine capsules yet again? In a halting voice, Wayne told them what he\u0027d dreamed. It was a hellish vision of Jimmy Jed, a skeleton in a yellow suit gone green and rotten with grave dirt, screaming that the witch of Hawthorne had sent him to Hell where he would burn forever if Wayne didn\u0027t free him. When he was finished, a terrible groan came from Wayne\u0027s throat, and tears glittered in his eyes. \"She knows where I am!\" he whispered. \"She\u0027s out there in the night, and she won\u0027t let my daddy come to me anymore!\" Bragg had gone a sick gray. Wayne\u0027s obsession with his dead father was getting worse, Hodges realized. For the past four nights, Wayne had been awakened with nightmares of Jimmy Jed and the Creekmores. Last night, he\u0027d even sworn that he\u0027d seen the Creekmore boy\u0027s pallid face grinning through the window at him. Wayne was coming to pieces, Hodges thought, right out here on the sunny Coast. \"I can\u0027t sleep,\" Wayne gripped Niles\u0027s smooth white hand. \"Please . . . my daddy\u0027s rotted, and I . . . can\u0027t make him all right again. ...\" Niles said softly, \"Everything\u0027s going to be fine. There\u0027s no need for you to be afraid, not while you\u0027re in Mr Krepsin\u0027s house. This is the safest place in the world for you. Why don\u0027t you put on your robe and slippers? I\u0027ll take you to see Mr Krepsin. He can give you something to calm your nerves - \" \"Now just one damned minute!\" Hodges said angrily. \"I don\u0027t like all these late-night \u0027visits\u0027 Wayne\u0027s been having with Krepsin! What\u0027s going on? We came here for a business conference and so far all we\u0027ve done is hang around this crazy house! Wayne\u0027s got other obligations. And I don\u0027t want him taking any more pills!\" \"Herbal medicine.\" Niles held Wayne\u0027s robe for him. \"Mr Krepsin believes in the healing power of Nature. And I\u0027m sure Wayne will agree that you\u0027re free to go anytime you please.\" \"What? And leave him here with you? Wayne, listen to me! We\u0027ve got to get back to Fayette! This whole thing is as shady as the dark side of the moon!\" Wayne tied his robe and stared at him. \"My daddy said I was to trust Mr. Krepsin. I want to stay here for a while longer. If you want to go, you can.\" Hodges saw that the young man\u0027s eyes looked blurry and dazed. His grip on reality was lost, Hodges knew . . . and just what kind of pills was Wayne being given? \"I\u0027m begging you,\" he said. \"Let\u0027s go home.\" \"Jim Coombs is going to take me up in the Challenger tomorrow,\" Wayne said. \"He says I can learn to fly it, no trouble at all.\" \"But what about the Crusade?\" Wayne shook his head. \"I\u0027m tired, George. I hurt inside. I am the Crusade, and where I go, that\u0027s where the Crusade goes too. Isn\u0027t that right?\" He looked at Henry Bragg. The lawyer\u0027s smile was tight and strained. \"Sure. Anything you say, Wayne. I\u0027m behind you one hundred percent.\" \"You gentlemen needn\u0027t stay up,\" Niles said, taking Wayne\u0027s elbow and leading him toward the door. \"I\u0027ll see that Wayne gets his sleep. ...\" And suddenly George Hodges\u0027s face reddened with anger, and he was crossing the room to clamp his hand on the other man\u0027s shoulder \"Listen to me, you - \" Niles twisted around in a blur, and for an instant there were two fingers pressing rigidly against the hollow of Hodges\u0027s throat. Hodges felt a brief, dizzying pain that almost buckled his knees, and then Niles\u0027s hand dropped to his side. A low fire burned in the man\u0027s pale gray eyes. Hodges coughed and backed away, his heart pounding. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Niles said. \"But you must never touch me like that again.\" \"You . . . you tried to kill me!\" Hodges croaked. \"I\u0027ve got witnesses! By God, I\u0027ll sue you for everything you\u0027ve got! I\u0027m getting out of here right now!\" He stalked past them and out of the room, his hand pressed to his throat. Niles glanced back at Bragg. \"Will you see to your friend, Mr. Bragg? There\u0027s no way for him to leave tonight, because the house is kept sealed by hydraulic pressure on the doors and the first-floor windows. I reacted hastily, and I regret it.\" \"Oh . . . sure. Well, no harm done. I mean, George is . . . kind of upset.\" \"Exactly. I\u0027m sure you can calm him down. We\u0027ll talk in the morning.\" \"Right,\" Bragg said, and managed a weak smile. Augustus Krepsin was waiting in his huge bedroom one floor up and on the other side of the house. When Wayne had first seen it, he\u0027d been reminded of a hospital room: the walls were an off-white, with a blue sky and clouds painted on the ceiling. There was a sunken living area with a sofa, a coffee table, and a few leather chairs. Persian rugs in soft colors covered the floor, and track lights delivered a delicate golden illumination. The large bed, complete with a console that controlled lighting, humidity, and temperature and contained several small closed-circuit television screens, was surrounded with a plastic curtain like an oxygen tent. An oxygen tank and mask were mounted next to the bed. The chess game was still on the long teak coffee table, where it had been left the night before. Krepsin, dressed in a long white robe, sat over it, his small eyes pondering options as Niles brought Wayne in; he was wearing his cotton booties and surgical gloves. His bulk was stuffed into a specially supported Angus steerhide chair. \"Another nightmare?\" he asked Wayne after Niles had left. \"Yes sir.\" \"Come sit down. Let\u0027s pick up the game where we left off.\" Wayne took his chair. Krepsin had been teaching him the fundamentals of the game; Wayne was losing badly, but the knights and pawns and rooks and whatever-they-weres took his mind off the bad dreams. \"They can be so real, can\u0027t they?\" Krepsin said. \"I think nightmares are more . . . true than ordinary dreams, don\u0027t you?\" He motioned toward the two pills - one pink, one white - and the cup of herbal tea that was set in front of Wayne. Without hesitation Wayne swallowed the pills and drank the tea. They helped relax him, helped smooth out the throbbing pain in his head, and when he did sleep, toward morning, he knew he would have wonderful dreams of when he was a child playing with Toby. In those drug-induced dreams everything was bright and happy, and Evil couldn\u0027t find its way into his head. \"A little man fears inconsequential things, but only a man of great character feels true horror. I enjoy our talks, Wayne. Don\u0027t you?\" He nodded. Already he was feeling better, his brain clearing, all the musty cobwebs of fear drifting away in what felt like a fresh summer wind. In a little while he would be laughing like a small boy, the worries and responsibilities faded away like bad dreams. \"You can always judge a man,\" Krepsin said, \"by what makes him afraid. And fear can be a tool, as well; a great lever that can move the world in any direction. You of all people must know the force of fear.\" \"Me?\" Wayne looked up from the board. \"Why?\" \"Because in this world there are two great terrors: disease and death. Do you know how many millions of bacteria inhabit the human body? How many organisms that can suddenly become malignant with disease and leech themselves into human tissues? You know how frail flesh can be, Wayne.\" \"Yes sir,\" Wayne said. \"It\u0027s your move.\" Wayne studied the inlaid ivory board. He moved a bishop, but had no particular plan in mind other than to capture one of Krepsin\u0027s black towers. Krepsin said, \"You\u0027ve already forgotten what I\u0027ve told you. You must keep looking over your shoulder.\" He reached across the board, his face like a bloated white moon, and moved the second of his black rooks to capture Wayne\u0027s last bishop. \"Why do you live like this?\" Wayne asked. \"Why don\u0027t you ever go outside?\" \"I do go outside, occasionally. When I have a trip scheduled. Forty-nine seconds between the door and the limousine. Forty-six seconds between the limo and the jet. But don\u0027t you understand what floats in the air? Every plague that ever ravaged across cities and countries, destroying hundreds and thousands, began with a tiny microorganism. A parasite, riding a sneeze or clinging to a flea on a rat\u0027s hide.\" He leaned toward Wayne, his eyes widening. \"Yellow fever. Typhus. Cholera. Malaria. The Black Plague. Syphilis. Blood flukes and worms can infect your body, drain your strength, and leave you a hollow shell. The bubonic plague bacillus can lie dormant and impotent for generations, and then suddenly it can lay half the world to waste.\" Small droplets of sweat glimmered on Krepsin\u0027s skull. \"Disease,\" he whispered. \"It\u0027s all around us. It\u0027s outside these walls right now, Wayne, pressed to the stones and trying to get in.\" \"But . . . people are immune to all those things now,\" Wayne said. \"There is no such thing as immunity!\" Krepsin almost shouted. His lips worked for a few seconds before he could speak. \"Levels of resistance rise and fall; diseases shift, parasites mutate and breed. Bubonic plague killed six million people in Bombay in 1898; in 1900 it broke out in San Francisco, and the same bacillus that causes plague has been found in the ground squirrel. Don\u0027t you see? It\u0027s waiting. There are cases of leprosy in the United States every year. Smallpox almost spread into the United States in 1948. The diseases are still out there! And there are new bacteria, new parasites, evolving all the time! \"If disease could be controlled, so could death,\" Krepsin said. \"What power a man would have! Not to have to . . . fear. That would make a man godlike, wouldn\u0027t it?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve . . . never thought about it that way.\" Wayne stared at Krepsin\u0027s bulbous face. The man\u0027s eyes were fathomless pools of ebony, the pores in his flesh as big as saucers. His face seemed to fill the entire room. Warmth coursed through Wayne, and a feeling of safety and belonging. He knew he was safe in this house, and though he might have nightmares sent by the witch-woman, she couldn\u0027t get in at him. Nothing could get in at him: not pressures or responsibilities or fears, not any of the diseases of real life. Krepsin rose from his chair with a grunt like a hippo rising from dark water. He lumbered across the room, drew aside the plastic curtain ringing his bed, and pressed a couple of buttons on the command console. Instantly images appeared on the three videotape screens. Wayne squinted and grinned. They were video tapes of his television show, and there he was on the three screens, touching people in the Healing Line. \"I\u0027ve watched these again and again,\" the huge man said. \"I hope I\u0027m watching the truth. If I am, then you\u0027re the one person in the world who can do for me what I want.\" He turned to face Wayne. \"My business is very complex and demanding. I own companies from L.A. to New York, plus many in foreign countries. I make a phone call, and stocks do what I want them to. People do anything to get close to me. But I\u0027m fifty-five years old, and I\u0027m susceptible to diseases, and I . . . feel things slipping away. I don\u0027t want that to happen, Wayne. I\u0027ll move Heaven - or Hell - to keep things as they are.\" His black eyes burned. \"I want to keep death away from me,\" he said. Wayne stared at his hands, clenched in his lap. Krepsin\u0027s voice echoed inside his head as if he were sitting within a huge cathedral. He remembered his daddy telling him to listen hard to what Mr. Krepsin had to say, because Mr Krepsin was a wise and just man. Krepsin put his hand on Wayne\u0027s shoulder. \"I\u0027ve told you my fear,\" he said. \"Now I want to hear yours.\" Reluctantly at first, Wayne began. Then he told more and more, wanting to get it all out of him and knowing Mr. Krepsin would understand. He told him about Ramona Creekmore and the boy, about how she\u0027d cursed both of them and wished his father dead, about his Daddy\u0027s death and rebirth, how she was making him have nightmares and how he couldn\u0027t get her face, or the demon boy\u0027s, out of his mind. \"She . . . makes my head hurt,\" Wayne said. \"And that boy . . . sometimes I see his eyes, staring at me like . . . like he thinks he\u0027s better than me. . . .\" Krepsin nodded. \"Do you trust me to do the right thing for you, Wayne?\" \"Yes sir I do.\" \"And I\u0027ve made you feel comfortable and safe here? And I\u0027ve helped you sleep and forget?\" \"Yes sir. I . . . feel like you believe me. You listen to me, and you understand. The others ... I can tell they\u0027re laughing at me, like up on the Tower. . . .\" \"The Tower?\" Krepsin asked. Wayne rubbed at his forehead but didn\u0027t reply. \"I want to show you how sincere I am, son. I want you to trust me. I can end your fear. It would be a simple thing. But . . . if I do this thing for you, I\u0027ll soon ask you to do something for me in return, to show me how sincere you are. Do you understand?\" The pills were working. The room had begun to slowly spin, colors merging together in a long rainbow scrawl. \"Yes sir,\" Wayne whispered. \"They should burn in the fires of Hell forever. Forever.\" \"I can send them to Hell, for you.\" He loomed over Wayne, squeezing his shoulder. \"I\u0027ll ask Mr. Niles to take care of it. He\u0027s a religious man.\" \"Mr. Niles is my friend,\" Wayne said. \"He comes in at night and talks to me, and he brings me a glass of orange juice just before I go to bed. . . .\" Wayne blinked and tried to focus on Krepsin\u0027s face. \"I . . . want some of the witch\u0027s hair. I want to hold it in my hand, so I\u0027ll know. ...\" The huge face smiled. \"A simple thing,\" it whispered. 49 Indian summer had lingered late. The blue evening light was darkening as yellow leaves stirred on the trees and a few of the dead ones chattered on the roof of the Creekmore house. Ramona turned up the lamp wicks in the front room as darkness gathered outside. A small fire burned in the hearth, her chair pulled up so she could warm herself near it - she followed the Choctaw custom of building little fires and stepping close, instead of the white man\u0027s belief in making a bonfire and standing back. On a table next to her a lamp burned, a metal reflector behind it, so she could read for the third time the letter she\u0027d gotten from her son today. It was written on lined notebook paper, but the envelope had Hillburn Institute and the address in nice black print up in the left-hand corner. Billy had been in Chicago for almost two weeks, and this was the second letter he\u0027d sent. He described what he\u0027d seen of the city and told her all about the Hillburn Institute. He\u0027d had long talks with Dr Mary Hillburn, he\u0027d said, and also with the other doctors who worked on a volunteer basis. Billy said he\u0027d met some of the other people, but many of them seemed withdrawn and kept to themselves. There was a Mr. Pearlman, a Mrs. Brannon, a Puerto Rican girl named Anita, and a scruffy-looking hippie named Brian; all of them, it seemed, had had an experience with what Dr Hillburn termed \"theta agents\" or \"discarnate entities.\" Billy also mentioned a girl named Bonnie Hailey; she was very pretty, he\u0027d written, but she stayed apart from the others and he saw her only infrequently. He was taking tests. Lots of tests. They\u0027d punched him with needles, wired electrodes to his head and studied squiggles on long pieces of paper that came from the machines he\u0027d been connected to. They\u0027d asked him to guess what kind of geometric shapes were printed on something called Zener cards, and he was keeping a diary of his dreams. Dr. Hillburn was very interested in his experiences with the shape changer, and whenever they talked she took everything down on a tape recorder. She seemed more demanding of him than of the others, and she\u0027d said that she looked forward to meeting Ramona sometime. Next week there would be hypnosis sessions and sleep deprivation, not something he particularly looked forward to. Billy said he loved her, and that he\u0027d write again soon. Ramona put his letter aside and listened to the wind. The fire crackled, casting a muted orange light. She\u0027d written a reply to Billy and had mailed it this afternoon. It had said: Son, you were right to leave Hawthorne. I don\u0027t know how things will tum out, but I have a lot of faith in you. Your Mystery Walk has led you out into the world, and it won\u0027t end in Chicago. No, it\u0027ll go on and on, right to the end of your days. Everybody\u0027s on their own kind of Mystery Walk, following the trail of their days and doing the best with what life throws at them. Sometimes its mighty hard to figure out what\u0027s right and wrong in this mixed-up world. What looks black can sometimes really be white, and what appears like chalk can sometimes be pure ebony. I\u0027ve been thinking a lot about Wayne. I drove over there once, but his house was dark. I\u0027m afraid for him. He\u0027s pulled toward you, just like you are to him, but he\u0027s scared and weak. His Mystery Walk might\u0027ve led him into teaching others how to heal themselves, but it\u0027s been warped now by greed and I don\u0027t think he can see his path clearly. You may not want to stomach this, but if ever in your life you can help him, you have to. You\u0027re bound by blood, and though the Walk took you off in different directions, you\u0027re still part of each other. Hate\u0027s easy. Loving\u0027s damned hard. You know what\u0027s a greater mystery than death, Billy? Life itself, the way it twists and turns like a carnival ride. By the by, I think I catch a little peacock-strutting when you talk about that Bonnie girl. I know she must be special if you\u0027ve taken a shine to her. I\u0027m very proud of you. I know you\u0027ll make me even prouder. I love you. She picked up the lamp and went to the bedroom to get her needlepoint. Catching her reflection in a mirror, she stopped to examine herself as she combed out her hair. She saw more gray hairs than dark, and there were so many wrinkles in her face. Still, there remained deep in her eyes the awkward girl who\u0027d seen John Creekmore standing across the barn at a hoedown, the girl who\u0027d wanted that boy to hold her until her ribs ached, the girl who\u0027d wanted to fly above the hills and fields on the wind of dreams. She was proud that she\u0027d never lost that part of herself. Her Mystery Walk was almost over, she realized with a touch of sadness. But, she thought, look at all she\u0027d done! She\u0027d loved a good man and been loved by him, had raised a son to manhood, had always stood up for herself and had done the painful work her destiny demanded. She had learned to take life for good or bad, and to see the Giver of Breath in a dewdrop or a dying leaf. She had only one pain, and that was the red-haired boy - the image of his father - that J.J. Falconer had named Wayne. Unsettled wind whooped around the house. Ramona put on a sweater and took her needlepoint to the fireside, where she sat and worked steadily for over an hour. There was a prickling sensation at the back of her neck, and she knew it wouldn\u0027t be very much longer. Something was coming through the night. She knew it was coming for her. She didn\u0027t know what it would look like, but she wanted to see its face and let it know she was not afraid. In the mirror she\u0027d seen her own black aura. She closed her eyes and let her mind drift. She was a child again, running wild and free across the green meadows in the heat of a summer sun. She lay down in the grass and watched the clouds change shape. There were castles up there, with fleecy towers and flags and - \"Ramona!\" she heard. \"Ramona!\" It was her mother, calling from the distance. \"Ramona, you little dickens! You get yourself home now, you hear?\" A hand brushed her cheek, and her eyes flew open. The fire and the lamp\u0027s wick had burned very low. She\u0027d recognized that touch, and she was filled with warmth. There was a knock at the door. Ramona rocked on in her chair a moment more. Then she lifted her chin, stood up, and approached the door; she let her hand rest on the latch for a few seconds, then she took a deep breath and opened it. A tall man in a straw cowboy hat, a denim jacket, and faded jeans stood on the porch. He had a grizzled gray beard and dark, deep-set brown eyes. Behind him there was a glossy black pickup truck. He chewed on a toothpick and drawled, \"Howdy, ma\u0027am. Seems I took a wrong turn up the road a ways. Sure would appreciate it if I could get some directions and maybe a glass of water. Throat\u0027s kind of - \" \"I know who you are,\" Ramona said, and saw a little shock and unease register in the man\u0027s eyes. He wasn\u0027t a real cowboy, she\u0027d seen, because his hands were too smooth. \"I know why you\u0027re here. Come in.\" He paused, the smile slipping off his face. He saw that she did know. Some of the power seemed to drain out of him, and under her firm gaze he felt like a bug that had just crawled from beneath a rock. He almost called it off right then and there, but he knew he couldn\u0027t take their money and run; they\u0027d find him, sooner or later After all, he was a professional. \"Aren\u0027t you coming in?\" she asked, and opened the door wider. He took the toothpick out of his mouth, mumbled, \"Thank you,\" and stepped across the threshold. He couldn\u0027t look her in the face, because she knew and she wasn\u0027t afraid and that made it unbearable for him. She was waiting. The man decided he\u0027d make it as quick and painless as possible. And that this would be his last one, God help him. Ramona closed the door to shut away the cold, then turned defiantly toward her visitor. ELEVEN The Test 50 A muffled cry burst from Billy\u0027s throat, and he sat up in the darkness as the cot\u0027s hard springs squealed beneath him. His mind was jumbled with terrors. He switched on the lamp and sat with the blanket around his shoulders as rain crashed against the window. He couldn\u0027t remember the details of the nightmare, but it had to do with his mother. And the house. Sparks flying into the night sky. The awful face of the shape changer, glowing dark red with reflected light. Billy got out of bed and trudged into the corridor. On his way to the men\u0027s bathroom he saw a light on downstairs, in the parlor. He descended the stairs, hoping to find someone he could talk to. In the parlor, a single lamp burned. The television was on, silently showing a ghostly test pattern. And curled up on the sofa, lying beneath a brown raincoat with patched elbows, was the girl with different-colored eyes. Except her eyes were closed now, and she was asleep. Billy stood over her for a moment, admiring the dark auburn of her hair and the beauty of her face. As he stared, she flinched in her sleep. She was even prettier than Melissa Pettus, he thought, but she seemed to be a troubled person. He\u0027d found out from Mr Pearlman that she was nineteen and her family lived in Texas. No one else knew anything about her. Suddenly, as if she\u0027d sensed him in the room, her eyelids fluttered. She sat up so abruptly he was startled and stepped back a pace. She stared at him with the fierce concentration of a trapped animal, but her eyes looked glazed and dead. \"They\u0027re going to burn up,\" she whispered, in a barely audible voice. \"Cappy says they will, and Cappy\u0027s never wrong - \" Then Billy saw her gaze clear, and he realized she\u0027d been talking in her sleep. She blinked uncertainly at him, a red flush creeping across her cheeks. \"What is it? What do you want?\" \"Nothing. I saw the light on.\" He smiled, trying to ease her obvious tension. \"Don\u0027t worry, I won\u0027t bite.\" She didn\u0027t respond, but instead drew the coat tighter around her. Billy saw she still wore jeans and a sweater, and either she\u0027d gotten dressed after she was supposed to be in bed or she\u0027d never been to bed at all. \"Doesn\u0027t look like there\u0027s much on TV,\" he said, and switched it off. \"How long have you been in here?\" \"Awhile,\" she replied, in her distinctive Texas drawl, topped with frost. \"Who\u0027s Cappy?\" She flinched as if he\u0027d struck her. \"Leave me alone,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t bother folks, and I don\u0027t want to be bothered.\" \"I didn\u0027t mean to disturb you. Sorry.\" He turned his back on her. She was surely a pretty girl, he thought, but she lacked in manners. He had almost reached the stairs when she said, \"What makes you so special?\" \"What?\" \"Dr. Hillburn thinks you\u0027re special. Why is that?\" He shrugged. \"I didn\u0027t know I was.\" \"Didn\u0027t say you were. Only said that Dr Hillburn thinks so. She spends a lot of time with you. Must think you\u0027re important.\" Billy paused at the bottom of the stairs, listening to the noise of the rain hammering at the walls. Bonnie sat with her legs drawn up defensively to her chest, the coat around her shoulders; there was a scared look in her eyes, and Billy knew she was asking for company in her own way. He walked back into the parlor. \"I don\u0027t know why. Really.\" A silence stretched. Bonnie wouldn\u0027t look at him. She stared out the bay window into the icy storm. \"It\u0027s sure been raining a lot today,\" Billy said. \"Mrs. Brannon says she thinks it\u0027ll snow soon.\" Bonnie didn\u0027t respond for a long while. Then she said softly, \"I hope it keeps rainin\u0027. I hope it rains and rains for weeks. Nothin\u0027 can burn if it rains like this, can it?\" She looked at him appealingly, and he was struck by her simple, natural beauty. She wore no makeup, and she looked freshly scrubbed and healthy but for the dark hollows under her eyes. Not enough sleep, he thought. He didn\u0027t understand her comment, so he didn\u0027t reply. \"Why do you always carry that?\" she asked. And it was only then that he realized he held the piece of coal gripped in his left hand. He must\u0027ve picked it up when he left his room. He was seldom without it, and he\u0027d explained its significance to Dr Hillburn when she\u0027d inquired. \"Is it like a good-luck charm or somethin\u0027?\" \"I guess so. I just carry it, that\u0027s all.\" \"Oh.\" Billy shifted his weight from foot to foot. He was wearing pajamas and a robe and slippers provided by the institute, and even though it was well after two in the morning he was in no hurry to return to bed. \"Where are you from in Texas?\" \"Lamesa. It\u0027s right between Lubbock and Big Spring. Where are you from in Alabama?\" \"Hawthorne. How\u0027d you know I was from Alabama?\" She shrugged. \"How\u0027d you know I was from Texas?\" \"I guess I asked somebody.\" He paused, studying her face. \"How come you\u0027ve got one blue eye and one green?\" \"How come you\u0027ve got curly hair if you\u0027re an Indian?\" He smiled, realizing she\u0027d been asking as many questions about him as he had about her. \"Do you always answer a question with a question?\" \"Do you?\" \"No. I\u0027m only part Indian. Choctaw. Don\u0027t worry, I won\u0027t take your scalp.\" \"I wasn\u0027t worryin\u0027. I come from a long line of Indian hunters.\" Billy laughed, and he saw from the sparkle in her eyes that she wanted to laugh, too, but she turned away from him and watched the rain. \"What are you doing so far from Texas?\" he asked. \"What are you doing so far from Alabama?\" He decided to try a different tack. \"I really think your eyes are pretty.\" \"No, they\u0027re not. They\u0027re different, is all.\" \"Sometimes it\u0027s good to be different.\" \"Sure.\" \"No, I mean it. You ought to be proud of the way you look. It sets you apart.\" \"It does that, all right.\" \"I mean it sets you apart in a good way. It makes you special. And who knows? Maybe you can see things more clearly than most folks.\" \"Maybe,\" she said quietly, in an uneasy tone of voice, \"it means I can see a lot of things I wish I couldn\u0027t.\" She looked up at him. \"Have you been talkin\u0027 to Dr. Hillburn about me?\" \"No.\" \"Then how\u0027d you know about Cappy? Only Dr. Hillburn knows about that.\" He told her what she\u0027d said when she was startled out of sleep, and it was clear she was annoyed. \"You shouldn\u0027t be creepin\u0027 around, anyway,\" Bonnie told him. \"You scared me, that\u0027s all. Why\u0027d you come sneakin\u0027 down here?\" \"I didn\u0027t sneak. I had a nightmare that woke me up.\" \"Nightmares,\" she whispered. \"Yeah, I know a lot about those.\" \"Haven\u0027t you been to bed?\" \"No.\" She paused, a frown working across her face. She had a scatter of freckles across her cheeks and nose, and Billy could envision her riding a horse under the Texas sun. She was a little too thin, but Billy figured she could take care of herself just fine. \"I don\u0027t like to sleep,\" Bonnie said after another moment. \"That\u0027s why I was down here. I wanted to watch TV and read as long as I could.\" \"Why?\" \"Well . . . it\u0027s just because I . . . have dreams sometimes. Nightmares. Sometimes they\u0027re . . . really awful. If I don\u0027t sleep, I won\u0027t see them. I . . . was even going to go out for a walk tonight, until it started rainin\u0027 so hard. But I hope it keeps on rainin\u0027 like this. Do you think it will?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Why\u0027s it so important to you?\" \"Because,\" she said, and gazed up at him, \"then what Cappy\u0027s been showing me won\u0027t come true. Nothin\u0027 can burn like what he\u0027s been making me see.\" The tone of her voice bordered on desperation. Billy sat down in a chair, prepared to listen if she wanted to talk. She did, and Billy listened without interrupting. The story came hesitantly: when Bonnie Hailey was eleven years old, she was struck by lightning on the stark Texas plain. All her hair burned off, her fingernails turned black, and she lay near death for almost a month. She recalled darkness, and voices, and wanting to let go; but every time she wanted to die she heard a clear, high childish voice tell her no, that letting go wasn\u0027t the answer The voice urged her over and over to hang on, to fight the pain. And she did, winning by slow degrees. She had a nurse named Mrs. Shelton, and every time Mrs. Shelton would come into the room Bonnie would hear a soft ringing sound in her ears. She began to have a strange recurring dream: a nurse\u0027s cap rolling down a flight of moving stairs. A week later, Bonnie found out that Mrs. Shelton had tripped on an escalator in a Lubbock department store and broken her neck. And that was the start of it. Bonnie called the strange, high voice in her head Cappy, after an invisible playmate she\u0027d had when she was five or six. She\u0027d had a lonely childhood, spending most of the time on the small ranch her stepfather owned near Lamesa. Cappy\u0027s visits became more frequent, and with them the dreams. She foresaw suitcases falling from a clear blue sky, over and over again, and she could even read a nametag and a flight number on one of the cases. Cappy told her to tell somebody, quickly, but Bonnie\u0027s mother had thought it was utter foolishness. Two planes collided over Dallas less than a week later, and suitcases were strewn over the plains for miles. There had been many other incidents of dreams and hearing what she called Death Bells, until finally her stepfather had called the National Star and they\u0027d come out to interview her. Her mother was horrified at the attention that followed, and in came in a flood of crackpot letters and obscene telephone calls. Her stepfather wanted her to write a book - oh, just make it up! he\u0027d told her - and for her to go on tour talking about the Death Bells. Bonnie\u0027s parents had split up, and it was clear to Bonnie that her mother was afraid of her and blamed her for the divorce. The dreams kept coming, and Cappy\u0027s voice with them, urging her to act. By this time, the National Star touted her as the Death Angel of Texas. \"A psychiatrist at the University of Texas wanted to talk to me,\" Bonnie said, in a quiet, tense voice. \"Mom didn\u0027t want me to go, but I knew I had to. Cappy wanted me to. Anyway, Dr. Callahan had worked with Dr. Hillburn before, so he called her and made arrangements to send me up here. Dr. Hillburn says I\u0027ve got precognition, that maybe the lightning jarred something in my brain and opened me up to signals from what she calls a \u0027messenger\u0027 She believes there are entities that stay here, in this world, after their bodies have died . . .\" \"Discarnates,\" Billy offered. \"Right. They stay here and try to help the rest of us, but not everybody can understand what they\u0027re trying to say.\" \"But you can.\" She shook her head. \"Not all the time. Sometimes the dreams aren\u0027t clear. Sometimes I can hardly understand Cappy\u0027s voice. Other times . . . maybe I don\u0027t want to hear what he\u0027s saying. I don\u0027t like to sleep, because I don\u0027t want to see what he shows me.\" \"And you\u0027ve been having dreams just recently?\" \"Yes,\" she said. \"For several nights now. I ... I haven\u0027t told Dr Hillburn yet. She\u0027ll want to hook me up to those machines again, and I\u0027m sick of those tests. Cappy\u0027s . . . shown me a building on fire. An old building, in a bad part of town. The fire\u0027s fast, and it\u0027s . . . it\u0027s so hot I can feel the heat on my own face. I can hear the fire engines coming. But the roof collapses, and I . . . can see people jumping out of the windows. It\u0027s going to happen, Billy. I know it is.\" \"But do you know where this building is?\" \"No, but I think it\u0027s here, in Chicago. All the other dreams I\u0027ve had came true within a hundred miles or so of where I was. Dr Hillburn thinks I\u0027m like . . . like a radar or something. My range is limited,\" she said, with a frightened little smile. \"Cappy says they\u0027re going to die if I can\u0027t help them. He says it\u0027s going to start in the wires, and it\u0027s going to be fast. He keeps saying something that sounds like \u0027spines,\u0027 but I can\u0027t figure out what he means.\" \"You need to let Dr Hillburn know,\" Billy told her. \"Tomorrow morning. Maybe she can help you.\" She nodded vaguely. \"Maybe. But I don\u0027t think so. I\u0027m so tired of being responsible, Billy. Why did it have to be me. Why?\" When she looked up at him, there were tears glimmering in her eyes. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said, and he reached out to take her hand as the rain flailed against the windows. For a long time they sat together, listening to the storm, and when the rain stopped Bonnie let out a soft, despairing whisper.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mystery-walk/page-14.html","bookId":2478,"book":{"id":2478,"title":"Mystery Walk","description":"Storyline: One talks to the dead.
