{"id":27988,"no":141,"title":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE","content":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE New York, Sunday morng., April 17th, 1853 Dearest, I arrived here in good condition Thursday night at ? past 12. Every moment of my time has been so taken up with calls and engagements that I really could not put pen to paper until now, when I am writing before going down to breakfast. It is almost as difficult to see O\u0027Sullivan here as if he were a hundred miles off. I rode three miles to his home on Friday, and found him not at home. However, he came yesterday, and we talked together until other people came between. I do wish I could be let alone, to follow my own ideas of what is agreeable. To-day, I am to dine with a college-professor of mathematics, to meet Miss Lynch!! Why did I ever leave thee, my own dearest wife? Now, thou seest, I am to be lynched. We have an ugly storm here to-day. I intend 222 to leave New York for Philadelphia tomorrow, and shall probably reach Washington on Wednesday. I am homesick for thee. The children, too, seem very good and beautiful. I hope Una will be very kind and sweet. As for Julian, let Ellen make him a pandowdy. Does Rosebud still remember me? It seems an age since I left home. No words can tell how I love thee. I will write again as soon as possible. Thine Ownest Husband. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3050/84365.html","bookId":1014,"book":{"id":1014,"title":"Love Letters of Nathaniel Hawthorne","description":"简介： In Hawthorne and His Wife and Memories of Hawthorne both Julian Hawthorne and his sister, Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, have given citations from the letters written by Nathaniel Hawthorne to Miss Sophia Peabody during their years of courtship.
