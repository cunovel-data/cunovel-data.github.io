HAWTHORNE Philadelphia, Tuesday 19th, 1853 Ownest, We left New York yesterday at 3 o\u0027clock, and arrived safely here, where we have spent the day. We leave for Washington tomorrow morning, and I shall mail this scribble there, so that thou wilt know that I have arrived in good condition. Thou canst not imagine the difficulty of finding time and place to write a word. I enjoy the journey and seeing new places, but need thee beyond all possibility of telling. I feel as if I had just begun to know that there is nothing else for me but thou. The children, too, I know how to love, at last. Kiss them all for me. In greatest haste (and in a public room), Thine ownest, N. H. Baltimore, Wednesday, 5 o\u0027clock.—Thus far in safety. I shall mail the letter immediately 224 on reaching Washington, where we expect to be at ? past 9. With love a thousand times more than ever, Thinest, N. H. Washington, Thursday.—Before Breakfast. —Dearest, I arrived so late and tired, last night, that I quite forgot to mail the letter. I found about a dozen letters awaiting me at the hotel, from other people, but none from thee. My heart is weary with longing for thee. I want thee in my arms. I shall go to the President at nine o\u0027clock this morning—shall spend three or four days here—and mean to be back early next week. Thine Ownest.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3050/84366.html","bookId":1014,"book":{"id":1014,"title":"Love Letters of Nathaniel Hawthorne","description":"简介： In Hawthorne and His Wife and Memories of Hawthorne both Julian Hawthorne and his sister, Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, have given citations from the letters written by Nathaniel Hawthorne to Miss Sophia Peabody during their years of courtship.
