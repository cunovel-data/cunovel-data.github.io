But this dismal gloom! I positively cannot submit to have this precious month all darkened with cloud and sullied with drizzle. Dearest, I return the manuscript tale. It is pretty enough; but I doubt whether it be particularly suited to the American public; and, if intended for publication, I trust it will undergo a very severe revision. It will need it. I speak frankly about this matter; but I should do the same (only more frankly still) if the translation were my Dove\u0027s own. I wonder whether Munroe has yet returned Grandfather\u0027s Chair to Elizabeth. I send back his books to-day. 61 Belovedest, I think thou wilt see me in the latter half of next week. Thou needest not to give up any visit to South Boston on this account; for I cannot get to thee before twelve o\u0027clock. It will be but an hour or so\u0027s visit. Thine with deepest and keenest love, Theodore De L\u0027Aubepine. Miss Sophia A. Peabody, Care of Dr. N.
