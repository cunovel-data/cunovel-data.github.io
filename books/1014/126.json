{"id":27973,"no":126,"title":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE","content":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE Surveyor\u0027s Office, July 5th, 1848 Unspeakably belovedest, thy letter has just been handed me, and I snatch a moment from much press of business to say a word to thee. It has made my heart heave like the sea, it is so tender and sweet. Ah, thou hast my whole soul. There is no thinking how much I love thee; and how blessed thy love makes me. I wonder how thou canst love me. Thy letter was also most comfortable to me, because it gives such a picture of thy life there with the children. It seemed as if I could see the whole family of my heart before my eyes, and could hear you all talking together. I began to be quite uneasy about little Bundlebreech\u0027s indisposition, until thy latest intelligence reassured me. Yet I shall be anxious to hear again. Dora could not come to Boston yesterday, to meet Rebecca, because she has an infinity of 192 work, and moreover, yesterday morning, she had to go to bed with the tooth-ache. I went to Boston to see the fireworks, and got home between 11 \u0026 12 o\u0027clock, last evening. I went into the little room to put on my linen coat; and, on my return into the sitting room, behold! a stranger there—whom dost thou think it might be?—it was Elizabeth! I did not wish to risk frightening her away by anything like an exhibition of wonder; and so we greeted one another kindly and cordially, but with no more empressement than if we were constantly in the habit of meeting. It being so late, and I so tired, we did not have much talk then; but she said she meant to go to walk this afternoon, and asked me to go with her—which I promised to do. Perhaps she will now make it her habit to come down and see us occasionally in the evening. Oh, my love, my heart calls for thee so, that I know not how to wait weeks longer for thee. Yet I would not that thou shouldst deprive the children of the beautiful country on that account. All will be repaid us in the first hour of meeting. Own wife, the coat does not crock the shirtsleeve in the least—so thy labor in lining it would have been thrown away. I gave the vest 193 to Louisa soon after thou wentest away, and have seen nothing of it since. I wish Una, and Julian too, would write a letter to Aunty \u0027Ouisa. I know it would give her as much pleasure as anything can. With infinite love, I am Thine Ownest. Naughtiest, I do not leave thy letter about. I would just as soon leave my own heart on the \"walking side,\" as Una calls it. Mrs. Sophia A. Hawthorne, West Newton.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3050/84350.html","bookId":1014,"book":{"id":1014,"title":"Love Letters of Nathaniel Hawthorne","description":"简介： In Hawthorne and His Wife and Memories of Hawthorne both Julian Hawthorne and his sister, Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, have given citations from the letters written by Nathaniel Hawthorne to Miss Sophia Peabody during their years of courtship.
