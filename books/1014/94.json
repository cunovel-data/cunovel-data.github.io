{"id":27941,"no":94,"title":"TO MISS PEABODY","content":"TO MISS PEABODY 54 Pinckney St., May 27th, 1842 Dearest Heart, Thy letter to my sisters was most beautiful—sweet, gentle, and magnanimous; such as no angel save my Dove, could have written. If they do not love thee, it will be because they have no hearts to love with;—and even if this were the case, I should not despair of thy planting the seeds of hearts in their bosoms. They will love thee, all in good time, dearest; and we will be very happy. I am so at this moment, while my breast heaves with the consciousness of what a treasure God has given me—in whom I see more to worship, and admire, and love, every day of my life; and shall see more and more as long as I live; else, it will be because my own nature retrogrades, instead of advancing. But thou wilt make me better and better, till I am even worthy to be thy husband. Oh, truest wife, what a long widowhood is this! Three evenings without a glimpse of thee! And I know not whether I am to come at six or seven 92 o\u0027clock tomorrow evening—or scarcely, indeed, whether I am to come at all. But, unless thou orderest me to the contrary, I shall come at seven o\u0027clock. I met Mr. Emerson at the Athenaeum yesterday. He tells me that our garden, \u0026c., makes fine progress. Would that we were there. God bless us. Thine Ownest. Miss Sophia A. Peabody, No. 13 West-street, Boston. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3050/84318.html","bookId":1014,"book":{"id":1014,"title":"Love Letters of Nathaniel Hawthorne","description":"简介： In Hawthorne and His Wife and Memories of Hawthorne both Julian Hawthorne and his sister, Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, have given citations from the letters written by Nathaniel Hawthorne to Miss Sophia Peabody during their years of courtship.
