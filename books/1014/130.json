{"id":27977,"no":130,"title":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE","content":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE Castle Dismal, Novr. 18th, 1848 Ownest Phoebe, Thy letter did not come till to-day; and I know not that I was ever more disappointed and impatient—for I was sure that it ought to have come yesterday, and went to the Post Office three times after it. Now I have nothing to tell thee, belovedest wife, but write thee just a word, because I must. Thou growest more and more absolutely essential to me, every day we live. I never knew how thou art intertwined with my being, till this absence. Darlingest, thou hast mentioned Horace\u0027s sickness two or three times, and I have speculated somewhat thereupon. Thou hast removed to West-street, likewise, and reservest the reasons till we meet. I wonder whether there be any connection between these two matters. But I do not feel anxious. If I am not of a hopeful nature, at least my imagination is not suggestive of 201 evil. If Una were to have the hooping-cough, I should be glad thou wast within Dr. Wesselhoeft\u0027s sphere. What a shadowy day is this! While this weather lasts, thou canst not come. Thy Belovedest Husband. Do not hasten home on my account—stay as long as thou deemest good. I well know how thy heart is tugging thee hitherward. Mrs. Sophia A. Hawthorne, Care of Dr. N. Peabody, Boston, Massachusetts.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3050/84354.html","bookId":1014,"book":{"id":1014,"title":"Love Letters of Nathaniel Hawthorne","description":"简介： In Hawthorne and His Wife and Memories of Hawthorne both Julian Hawthorne and his sister, Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, have given citations from the letters written by Nathaniel Hawthorne to Miss Sophia Peabody during their years of courtship.
