{"id":27975,"no":128,"title":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE","content":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE Salem, July 12th, 1848 Dearest Phoebe, I enclose an advertisement of silks. Aunty \u0027Ouisa would like to have you get some patterns of those which she has marked with a pencil. A letter from Mrs. F. Shaw came for thee to-day; and I opened and read it. It contains nothing that requires thy immediate perusal; and as it is rather bulky, I do not send it. She is well, and so is Caroline Sturgis. I hear great accounts of the canary birds, now exhibiting in Boston; and it seems to me thou mightest please Una very much by taking her to see them. I need thee very much indeed, and shall heartily thank God when thou comest back to thine own home—and thine ownest husband. What a wretched time thou art having on that infernal mattress——Truly do I pity thee, cooped up in that hot and dusty house, such a day as this. 197 Were it not for Dr. Wesselhoeft, I should think it best for thee to get away immediately. Did Una remember me, when she waked up?—and has little Bundlebreech wanted me?—and dost thou thyself think of me with moderate kindness? Oh, Phoebe, it is too great a sacrifice—this whole blank month in our wedded life. I want thee always. Thy Lovingest Spouse. Mrs. Sophia A. Hawthorne, Care of Dr. N. Peabody, Boston, Massachusetts.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3050/84352.html","bookId":1014,"book":{"id":1014,"title":"Love Letters of Nathaniel Hawthorne","description":"简介： In Hawthorne and His Wife and Memories of Hawthorne both Julian Hawthorne and his sister, Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, have given citations from the letters written by Nathaniel Hawthorne to Miss Sophia Peabody during their years of courtship.
