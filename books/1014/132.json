I almost feel as if I ought to come every day; but then I should do so little good—arriving at 4 o\u0027clock; and the children going to bed at six or seven; and the expense is so considerable. If thou canst hold out till Friday, I shall endeavor to come in the afternoon and stay till Monday. But this must depend on arrangements hereafter to be made; so do not absolutely expect me before Saturday. Oh that Providence would bring all of you home, before then! This is a miserable time for me; more so than for thee, with all thy toil, and watchfulness and weariness. These sunless days are as sunless within as without. Thou hast no conception how melancholy our house can be. It absolutely chills my heart. If it is necessary for me to come sooner, write 205 by express. Give my love to Una and Julian, and tell them how much I miss them. God bless thee and them. Thine Ownest. Mrs. Sophia A. Hawthorne, Care of Dr. N. Peabody, 13 West-street, Boston. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3050/84356.html","bookId":1014,"book":{"id":1014,"title":"Love Letters of Nathaniel Hawthorne","description":"简介： In Hawthorne and His Wife and Memories of Hawthorne both Julian Hawthorne and his sister, Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, have given citations from the letters written by Nathaniel Hawthorne to Miss Sophia Peabody during their years of courtship.
