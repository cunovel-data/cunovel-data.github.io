Ellery goes to-day—much to my satisfaction, though we have had a good time. Thou dost not know how much I long to see thee and our children.

It is no matter about the session at Johnson\u0027s; and if thou choosest to give him notice, so be it. Now that the days are so long, would it not do to leave Boston, on our return, at ? past 4? Kiss Una for me—likewise Bundlebreech. Thy Husband. P.S.
