Monday [1841] Truest Heart, I cannot come to thee this evening, because my friend Bridge is in town, whom I hardly have seen for years past. Alas! I know not whether I am a very faithful friend to him; for I cannot rejoice that he is here, since it will keep me from my Dove. Thou art my only reality—all other people are but shadows to me: all events and actions, in which thou dost not mingle, are but dreams. Do thou be good, dearest love, and when I come, tomorrow night, let me find thee magnificent. Thou didst make me very happy, yesterday forenoon—thou wast a south-west wind—or the sweetest and wholesomest wind that blows, whichever it may be. I love thee more than I can estimate; 240 and last night I dreamed of thee. I know not exactly what; but we were happy. God bless thee. Thine ownest husband, Theodore de L\u0027Aubepine. A Madame, Madame Sophie Amelie de L\u0027Aubepine, Rue d\u0027Ouest, à Boston. Miss Sophia A.
