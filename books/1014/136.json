I will be in Pittsfield on Thursday next (a week from to-day) and will escort thee home. I have written quite a small volume of Julian\u0027s daily life and mine; so that, on thy return, thou wilt know everything that we have done and suffered;—as to enjoyment, I don\u0027t remember to have had any, during thy absence. It has been all doing and suffering. Thou sayest nothing whatever of Una. Unless I receive further notice from thee I shall consider Thursday the day. I shall go at any rate, I think, rain or shine; but of course, thou wilt not start in a settled rain. In that case, I shall come again to Pittsfield, the next day. But, if fair weather, I hope nothing will detain thee; or if it necessarily must, and thou 212 has[t] previous knowledge of it, thou canst write me. Julian is perfectly well. We both, according to our respective capacities, long for thee. Thinest, N.
