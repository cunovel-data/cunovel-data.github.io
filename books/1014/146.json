{"id":27993,"no":146,"title":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE","content":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE Liverpool, July 30th, 1855 Dearest, I slept at Lancaster, last night, where I arrived at 10 o\u0027clock; and leaving at ? past nine, this morning, got here at twelve. Since leaving you, I have been thinking that we have skimmed the cream of the lakes, and perhaps may as well go somewhere else, now. What if you should come to Liverpool (that is, to Rock Ferry Hotel) and spend a day or two, for the sake of variety, and then go to Matlock or Malvern, or wherever we may think best? Should you conclude to do this, I think you had better take a phaeton \u0026 pair from Grasmere to Windermere, and there you can get on the rail. If you wish to stay longer at the lakes, however, I shall be quite happy to come back. Mr. Wildeys says that lodgings may be had reasonable (and some at farmers\u0027 houses) in the vicinity of 231 Bourness; but he does not know of any in particular. Weigh these matters, and decide for yourself. I have an impression, I hardly know why, that we have done with the lakes for this year; but I should not regret to have you stay longer. I send the halves of a ￡10 \u0026 of a ￡5. There would be no difficulty in your coming here without a male attendant. Do not think that I wish you to come, contrary to your opinion. If you and the children are comfortable \u0026 happy, I am quite content to take another draught of the lakes. Kiss them all. Thine N. Mr. Bradford and Miss Ripley sailed a fortnight ago. Mr. Bright was in this morning.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3050/84370.html","bookId":1014,"book":{"id":1014,"title":"Love Letters of Nathaniel Hawthorne","description":"简介： In Hawthorne and His Wife and Memories of Hawthorne both Julian Hawthorne and his sister, Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, have given citations from the letters written by Nathaniel Hawthorne to Miss Sophia Peabody during their years of courtship.
