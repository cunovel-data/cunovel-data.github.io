Belovedest and blessedest, I cannot feel anything but comfort in you. Rest quietly on my deep, deep, deepest affection. You deserve it all, and infinitely more than all, were it only for the happiness you give me. I apprehended that this cup could not pass from you, without your tasting bitterness among its dregs. You have been too calm, my beloved—you have exhausted your strength. Let your soul lean upon my love, till we meet again—then all your troubles shall be hushed. Your ownest, happiest, Deodatus. 99 How does Sophie Hawthorne do? Expect a letter on Tuesday. God bless my dearest. Miss Sophia A. Peabody, Care of Dr. N.
