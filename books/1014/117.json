Ownest dearest, I have this moment received the packet and thy letter, and cannot tolerate that thou shouldst not have a word from thy husband tomorrow morning. Truly, Castle Dismal has seemed darker than ever, since I returned to it;—and not only to me, but to its other inmates. Louisa spoke of the awful stillness of the house, and said she could not bear to give Una\u0027s old shoes to that little Lines child, and was going to keep them herself. I rejoiced her much, by telling her of Una\u0027s home-sickness. Fees were tolerably good, yesterday and to-day; and I doubt we shall have enough to live on, during thy continuance in Boston—for which let us be thankful. Bridge came to see me this afternoon, and says Mary Pray has consented to come to thee; and by this time, I hope, thou hast her. Thou canst not 168 think what a peace I enjoy in the consideration that thou art within reach of Dr. Wesselhoeft. It is by my feelings as to thee and Una, more than on my own account, that I find I am a true believer in homeopathy. Ownest, I love thee. I love little Una dearly too. Tell her so, and show her the place, and give her a kiss for me. Thine Ownest Husband. Mrs. Sophia A. Hawthorne, Care of Dr. N. Peabody, Boston, Massachusetts. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3050/84341.html","bookId":1014,"book":{"id":1014,"title":"Love Letters of Nathaniel Hawthorne","description":"简介： In Hawthorne and His Wife and Memories of Hawthorne both Julian Hawthorne and his sister, Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, have given citations from the letters written by Nathaniel Hawthorne to Miss Sophia Peabody during their years of courtship.
