{"id":27991,"no":144,"title":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE","content":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE Liverpool, July 26th, \u002754 Dearest Wife, We had the pleasantest passage, yesterday, that can be conceived of. How strange, that the best weather I have ever known should have come to us on these English coasts! I enclose some letters from the O\u0027Sullivan\u0027s, whereby you will see that they have come to a true appreciation of Mr. Cecil\u0027s merits. They say nothing of his departure; but I shall live in daily terror of his arrival. I hardly think it worth while for me to return to the island, this summer;—that is, unless you conclude to stay longer than a week from this time. Do so, by all means, if you think the residence will benefit either yourself or the children. Or it would be easy to return thither, should it seem desirable—or to go somewhere else. Tell me what day you fix upon for leaving; and I will either await you in person at the landing-place, 227 or send Henry. Do not start, unless the weather promises to be favorable, even though you should be all ready to go on board. I think you should give something to the servants—those of them, at least, who have taken any particular pains with you. Michael asked me for something, but I told him that I should probably be back again;—so you must pay him my debts and your own too. It is very lonesome at Rock Ferry, and I long to have you all back again. Give my love to the children. Thine Ownest.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3050/84368.html","bookId":1014,"book":{"id":1014,"title":"Love Letters of Nathaniel Hawthorne","description":"简介： In Hawthorne and His Wife and Memories of Hawthorne both Julian Hawthorne and his sister, Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, have given citations from the letters written by Nathaniel Hawthorne to Miss Sophia Peabody during their years of courtship.
