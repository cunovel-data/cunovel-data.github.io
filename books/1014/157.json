{"id":28004,"no":157,"title":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE","content":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE Continental Hotel, Philadelphia, March 9th, \u002762 Dearest Wife, Wishing to spend a little while in New York, we did not leave there till 2 o\u0027clock, yesterday, and so are not yet in Washington. I had a pleasant time in New York, and went on Friday evening, by invitation, to the Century Club, where I met various artists and literary people. The next forenoon, Ticknor strolled round among his acquaintances, taking me with him. Nothing remarkable happened, save that my poor old bedevilled phizmahogany was seized upon and photographed for a stereoscope; and as far as I could judge from the negative, it threatens to be fearfully like. The weather here is very warm and pleasant; there are no traces of snow and it seems like the latter end of April. I feel perfectly well, and have a great appetite. The farther we go, the deeper grows the rumble and grumble of the coming 278 storm, and I think the two armies are only waiting our arrival to begin. We expect to leave Philadelphia at 8? tomorrow morning, and shall reach Washington at 6 o\u0027clock P.M. It I have an opportunity, I shall send off Una\u0027s note the same evening, but cannot tell how.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3050/84381.html","bookId":1014,"book":{"id":1014,"title":"Love Letters of Nathaniel Hawthorne","description":"简介： In Hawthorne and His Wife and Memories of Hawthorne both Julian Hawthorne and his sister, Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, have given citations from the letters written by Nathaniel Hawthorne to Miss Sophia Peabody during their years of courtship.
