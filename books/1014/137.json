HAWTHORNE Lenox, August 8th, 1851 Ownest Phoebe, I wrote thee a note yesterday, and sent it to the village by Cornelius; but as he may have neglected to put it in, I write again. If thou wilt start from West Newton on Thursday next, I will meet thee at Pittsfield, which will answer the same purpose as if I came all the way. Mrs. Tappan requests that thou wilt bring ten pounds of ground rice for her; or a less quantity, if thou hast not room for so much. Julian is very well, and keeps himself happy from morning till night. I hope Una does the same. Give my love to her. I shall be most gladdest to see thee. Thine, N. H. August 9th.—Saturday.—I recd. yesterday 214 thy note, in which thou speakest of deferring thy return some days longer. Stay by all means as long as may be needful. Julian gets along perfectly well; and I am eager for thy coming only because it is unpleasant to remain torn asunder. Thou wilt write to tell me finally what day thou decidest upon;—but unless I hear from thee, I shall go to Pittsfield on Saturday, a week from to-day. But if thou seest reason for staying longer do so, that nothing may be left at loose ends. Julian and I had a fine ride yesterday with Herman Melville and two other gentlemen. Mrs. Peters is perfectly angelic. Thinest, N.
