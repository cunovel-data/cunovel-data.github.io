HAWTHORNE Salem, Sept. 23d, 1851 Dearest, I have just received thy two letters; they having been forwarded hither by Ticknor \u0026 Co. I wish thou hadst not had the head-ache; it gives me the heart-ache. In regard to the rent, it is much to pay; but thou art to remember that we take the house only till we can get another; and that we shall not probably have to pay more than half, at most, of the $350. It does seem to me better to go; for we shall never be comfortable in Lenox again. Ticknor \u0026 Co. promise the most liberal advances of money, should we need it, towards buying the house. I will tell thee my adventures when I come. 218 I am to return to Boston to-night, and fully intend to be in Lenox by Saturday night. In hugest haste, Thine Ownest. Mrs. Sophia A.
