HAWTHORNE Concord, May 29th, 1844 Ownest Wife, Conolly is leaving me, to my unspeakable relief; for he has had a bad cold, which caused him to be much more troublesome, and less amusing, than might otherwise have been the case. Thy husband is in perfect health; and as happy in the prospect of being alone, as he would be in anything, except to be reunited to thee. I suppose I must invite Mr. Farley to come by-and-by; but not quite yet—Oh, not quite yet—it is so sweet to be alone. I want to draw a little free breath. Ah, why canst not thou be with me here—and no Mary—no nobody else! But our little Una! Should not she be of the party? Yes; we have linked a third spirit forever to our own; and there is no existing without her. Dearest Phoebe, I do trust thou art well and at ease. Thou absolutely knowest not how I love thee. God bless thee, mine ownest—God bless 133 our daughter—God bless thy husband—God bless us altogether, and the whole world too. I write in the greatest hurry. Thine Ownest Husband. Have no apprehensions on my account. I shall write to Farley at the end of the week—and till then shall bathe myself in solitude. Mrs. Sophia A. Hawthorne, Care of Dr. N. Peabody, 13 West-street, Boston, Mass.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3050/84331.html","bookId":1014,"book":{"id":1014,"title":"Love Letters of Nathaniel Hawthorne","description":"简介： In Hawthorne and His Wife and Memories of Hawthorne both Julian Hawthorne and his sister, Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, have given citations from the letters written by Nathaniel Hawthorne to Miss Sophia Peabody during their years of courtship.
