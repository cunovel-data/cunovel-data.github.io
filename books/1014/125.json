{"id":27972,"no":125,"title":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE","content":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE Salem, July 1st, 1848 Ownest, How long is it since I heard from thee—and what an eternity since thou didst go away! It seems at least as long as the whole time that we have been married. My heart calls for thee, very loudly, and thou comest not. And I want to hear our children\u0027s voices;—it would be pleasant, even, to see little Tornado in one of her tantrums. She is a noble child. Kiss her and Bundlebreech for me, and talk to them about me, lest I be entirely forgotten. If this had been a pleasant day, I should probably have gone to New York on Custom-House business; but it being thick and dismal, I shall give up the expedition, although it would have been a very favorable opportunity. I should have been back here on Wednesday morning; and as one of the intervening days is Sunday, and 189 another the Fourth of July, only a single day of attendance at my office would have been lost. Best of all, it would have cost nothing. Dora has a great deal of work to do; but she neglects nothing appertaining to my comfort. Aunty \u0027Ouisa has favored me with one cup of coffee, since thou wentest away, and with an occasional doughnut; but I think thy lectures on diet and regimen have produced a considerable effect. Dearest, is thy absence so nearly over that we can now see light glimmering at the end of it? Is it half over? If not, I really do not see how I am to bear it. A month of non-existence is the utmost limit—— I am continually interrupted as I write, this being pay-day, and a very busy time. I don\u0027t know exactly what will be the amount of our fees; but I should think it would be about as good a month as the last. Thirty-five dollars, however, have already been drawn for our quarter\u0027s rent. If thou wantest any more money, as probably thou dost, write me how much, and I will send it. How much must I reserve to pay Rebecca\u0027s wages? Any surplus, I intend to apply in lessening Millet\u0027s bill. Here comes somebody else. Ownest wife, I am the best, and truest, and lovingest husband that ever was, because thy goodness makes me so. Mrs. Sophia A.
