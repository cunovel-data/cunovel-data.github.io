{"id":27963,"no":116,"title":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE","content":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE Salem, Jany. 19th, 1846.—Tuesday Ownest Phoebe, The shoe arrived last evening; but on what evidence thou dost so confidently accuse me of putting it into the trunk, I cannot imagine. Thou positively didst put it there thyself. I saw thee! Dearest, if any money comes from New York by to-day\u0027s mail, I will come to Boston on Thursday morning, to escort thee home. Otherwise, I really do not think I ought. Heaven knows, I desire it; but as it is not necessary for thy safety, and as we are so miserably poor, methinks the dollar should be reserved for indispensables. I did hope the New York money would have come to hand before now. Providence must take our matters in hand very speedily. I hope, Phoebe, thou hast not engaged to pay Winifred\u0027s passage, either to or from Boston. She told Mrs. Dromedary that she should not have 165 gone with thee, only that her passage would be paid. She has a cousin living at the Essex House in this city; and the Dromedary thinks she is partly engaged to go there herself. This is the secret of her willingness to remain in Salem. Dotish as she appeared, she has wit enough to be fair and false, like all her countryfolk. It will be well to investigate this matter before thou returnest; and, if she really means to leave us, perhaps thou hadst better engage a new girl in Boston forthwith. Poor little Una\u0027s back—my heart bleeds for it. Do not come back till it is well, nor till thou thyself hast undergone thorough repairs, even though thou shouldst be compelled to hire a lodging. Ownest, be careful not to slip down. Thou art prudent in behalf of other people, but hast little caution on thine own account. In going to the cars do not get entangled in that great rush of people who throng out of the ferry-boat. Remain behind, and Heaven will find thee a seat. Would thou wast safe home again, eating thy potatoes, and glancing sideways at me with thy look of patient resignation. Never did I miss thee so much as during this separation. But for the idea of thee, my existence would be as cold and wintry as the weather is now, and with a cloudy gloom 166 besides, instead of the dazzling sunshine. I was driven to play cards with Louisa, last evening! God bless thee! I have nothing more to say, that can be said. Thine Ownest Husband. Mrs. Sophia A. Hawthorne, Care of Dr. N. Peabody, Boston, Massachusetts. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3050/84340.html","bookId":1014,"book":{"id":1014,"title":"Love Letters of Nathaniel Hawthorne","description":"简介： In Hawthorne and His Wife and Memories of Hawthorne both Julian Hawthorne and his sister, Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, have given citations from the letters written by Nathaniel Hawthorne to Miss Sophia Peabody during their years of courtship.
