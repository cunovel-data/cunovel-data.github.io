{"id":27999,"no":152,"title":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE","content":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE Liverpool, Decr. 11th, 1858 Dearest, This despatch for O\u0027Sullivan has just reached me; and I do not know whether there will be time to send it by the steamer that sails to-day. Your letters, written immediately after the receipt of the sad news, did not reach me till yesterday; while those by the Southampton steamer, written afterwards, arrived here days ago. Those Liverpool steamers are not nearly such safe mediums as those by Southampton; and no letters of importance ought to be trusted to them. Mrs. Blodgett will buy the articles required by Mrs. O\u0027Sullivan, and likewise the soap for you, and have them in readiness for the next Liverpool steamer. We are quite well (Julian and I) and as contented as we can expect to be, among strangers, and in a continual cold fog. I have heard no private news from America, since I wrote last. 262 I have not a moment\u0027s time to write Una; but kiss her for me, and Rosebud too. Neither can I tell thee, in this little moment, how infinitely I love thee. Thinest. P.S. Tell O\u0027Sullivan that Mr. Miller (Despatch Agent) will allow the postage of this package in his account with Government.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3050/84376.html","bookId":1014,"book":{"id":1014,"title":"Love Letters of Nathaniel Hawthorne","description":"简介： In Hawthorne and His Wife and Memories of Hawthorne both Julian Hawthorne and his sister, Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, have given citations from the letters written by Nathaniel Hawthorne to Miss Sophia Peabody during their years of courtship.
