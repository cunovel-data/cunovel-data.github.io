{"id":27969,"no":122,"title":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE","content":"TO MRS. HAWTHORNE Surveyor\u0027s Office, Salem, May 5th, 1848 Ownest Phoebe, I am altogether in favor of getting the six chairs; as to the glass, I know not what to think. In fact, I must leave all other articles to thy judgment, and shall be satisfied, whatever thou dost. We can dispense with the glass better than with anything else. I rather covet the large marble-top table; but perhaps the repairs would make it otherwise than cheap. Una behaves (as thou wouldst affirm) like an angel. We rode out to Lynn, yesterday afternoon, and had a long walk—much to her delight. I bathed her this morning; and I believe she has not shown the slightest wilfulness or waywardness, since thy departure. We have very loving times together. I had a great mind to come to Boston, yesterday, 180 with Una, instead of alighting at Lynn. I felt thy magnetism drawing me thither. Thine Ownest. If thou canst get me a book or two, I shall be glad. Kiss old Bundlebreech, and ask him if he remembers me. If thou art very desirous of it, thou mayst stay till Monday—or, indeed, a week or two longer—or ten years, if thou thinkest proper. I seem already to have been solitary at least so long. Mrs. Sophia A. Hawthorne, Care of Dr. N. Peabody, Boston, Mass. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3050/84346.html","bookId":1014,"book":{"id":1014,"title":"Love Letters of Nathaniel Hawthorne","description":"简介： In Hawthorne and His Wife and Memories of Hawthorne both Julian Hawthorne and his sister, Rose Hawthorne Lathrop, have given citations from the letters written by Nathaniel Hawthorne to Miss Sophia Peabody during their years of courtship.
