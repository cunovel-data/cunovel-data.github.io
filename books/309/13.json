{"id":29894,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"Hey, old friend. What do you say, old friend? Make it okay, old friend, Give an old friendship a break. Why so grim? We\u0027re going on forever. You, me, him- Too many lives are at stake... -Stephen Sondheim, \"Old Friends\" It was Saturday morning. Shadow answered the door. Marguerite Olsen was there. She did hot come in, just stood in the sunlight, looking serious. \"Mister Ainsel...?\" \"Mike, please,\" said Shadow. \"Mike, yes. Would you like to come over for dinner tonight? About six, eh? It won\u0027t be anything exciting, just spaghetti and meatballs.\" \"I like spaghetti and meatballs.\" \"Obviously, if you have any other plans...\" \"I have no other plans.\" \"Six o\u0027clock.\" \"Should I bring flowers?\" \"If you must. But this is a social gesture. Not a romantic one.\" He showered. He went for a short walk, down to the bridge and back. The sun was up, a tarnished quarter in the sky, and he was sweating in his coat by the time he got home. He drove the 4-Runner down to Dave\u0027s Finest Food and bought a bottle of wine. It was a twenty-dollar bottle, which seemed to Shadow like some kind of guarantee of quality. He didn\u0027t know wines, so he bought a Californian cabernet, because Shadow had once seen a bumper-sticker, back when he was younger and people still had bumper stickers on their cars, which said LIFE is A CABERNET and it had made him laugh. He bought a plant in a pot as a gift. Green leaves, no flowers. Nothing remotely romantic about that. He bought a carton of milk, which he would never drink, and a selection of fruit, which he would never eat. Then he drove over to Mabel\u0027s and bought a single lunchtime pasty. Mabel\u0027s face lit up when she saw him. \"Did Hinzelmann catch up with you?\" \"I didn\u0027t know he was looking for me.\" \"Yup. Wants to take you ice fishing. And Chad Mulligan wanted to know if I\u0027d seen you around. His cousin\u0027s here from out of state. His second cousin, what we used to call kissing cousins. Such a sweetheart. You\u0027ll love her,\" and she dropped the pasty into a brown paper bag, twisted the top over to keep the pasty warm. Shadow drove the long way home, eating one-handed, the pastry crumbs tumbling onto his jeans and onto the floor of the 4-Runner. He passed the library on the south shore of the lake. It was a black-and-white town in the ice and the snow. Spring seemed unimaginably far away: the klunker would always sit on the ice, with the ice-fishing shelters and the pickup trucks and the snowmobile tracks. He reached his apartment, parked, walked up the drive, up the wooden steps to his apartment. The goldfinches and nuthatches on the birdfeeder hardly gave him a glance. He went inside. He watered the plant, wondered whether or not to put the wine into the refrigerator. There was a lot of time to kill until six. Shadow wished he could comfortably watch television once more. He wanted to be entertained, not to have to think, just to sit and let the sounds and the light wash over him. Do you want to see Lucy\u0027s tits? something with a Lucy voice whispered in his memory, and he shook his head, although there was no one there to see him. He was nervous, he realized. This would be his first real social interaction with other people-normal people, not people in jail, not gods or culture heroes or dreams-since he was first arrested, over three years ago. He would have to make conversation, as Mike Ainsel. He checked his watch. It was two-thirty. Marguerite Olsen had told him to be there at six. Did she mean six exactly? Should he be there a little early? A little late? He decided, eventually, to walk next door at five past six. Shadow\u0027s telephone rang. \"Yeah?\" he said. \"That\u0027s no way to answer the phone,\" growled Wednesday. \"When I get my telephone connected I\u0027ll answer it politely,\" said Shadow. \"Can I help you?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Wednesday. There was a pause. Then he said, \"Organizing gods is like herding cats into straight lines. They don\u0027t take naturally to it.\" There was a deadness, and an exhaustion, in Wednesday\u0027s voice that Shadow had never heard before. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" \"It\u0027s hard. It\u0027s too fucking hard. I don\u0027t know if this is going to work. We might as well cut our throats. Just cut our own throats.\" \"You mustn\u0027t talk like that.\" \"Yeah. Right.\" \"Well, if you do cut your throat,\" said Shadow, trying to jolly Wednesday out of his darkness, \"maybe it wouldn\u0027t even hurt.\" \"It would hurt. Even for my kind, pain still hurts. If you move and act in the material world, then the material world acts on you. Pain hurts, just as greed intoxicates and lust burns. We may not die easy and we sure as hell don\u0027t die well, but we can die. If we\u0027re still loved and remembered, something else a whole lot like us comes along and takes our place and the whole damn thing starts all over again. And if we\u0027re forgotten, we\u0027re done.\" Shadow did not know what to say. He said, \"So where are you calling from?\" \"None of your goddamn business.\" \"Are you drunk?\" \"Not yet. I just keep thinking about Thor. You never knew him. Big guy, like you. Good-hearted. Not bright, but he\u0027d give you the goddamned shirt off his back if you asked him. And he killed himself. He put a gun in his mouth and blew his head off in Philadelphia in 1932. What kind of a way is that for a god to die?\" \"I\u0027m sorry.\" \"You don\u0027t give two fucking cents, son. He was a whole lot like you. Big and dumb.\" Wednesday stopped talking. He coughed. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" said Shadow, for the second time. \"They got in touch.\" \"Who did?\" \"The opposition.\" \"And?\" \"They want to discuss a truce. Peace talks. Live and let fucking live.\" \"So what happens now?\" \"Now I go and drink bad coffee with the modern assholes in a Kansas City Masonic Hall.\" \"Okay. You going to pick me up, or shall I meet you somewhere?\" \"You stay there and you keep your head down. Don\u0027t get into any trouble. You hear me?\" \"But-\" There was a click, and the line went dead and stayed dead. There was no dial tone, but then, there never had been. Nothing but time to kill. The conversation with Wednesday had left Shadow with a sense of disquiet. He got up, intending to go for a walk, but already the light was fading, and he sat back down again. Shadow picked up the Minutes of the Lakeside City Council 1872-1884 and turned the pages, his eyes scanning the tiny print, not actually reading it, occasionally stopping to scan something that caught his eye. In July 1874, Shadow learned, the city council was concerned about the number of itinerant foreign loggers arriving in the town. An opera house was to be built on the corner of Third Street and Broadway. It was to be expected that the nuisances attendant to the damming of the Mill-Creek would abate once the mill-pond had become a lake. The council authorized the payment of seventy dollars to Mr. Samuel Samuels, and of eighty-five dollars to Mr. Heikki Salminen, in compensation for their land and for the expenses incurred in moving their domiciles out of the area to be flooded. It had never occurred to Shadow before that the lake was manmade. Why call a town Lakeside, when the lake had begun as a dammed mill-pond? He read on, to discover that a Mr. Hinzelmann, originally of Hildemuhlen in Bavaria, was in charge of the lake-building project, and that the city council had granted him the sum of $370 toward the project, any shortfall to be made up by public subscription. Shadow tore off a strip of a paper towel and placed it into the book as a bookmark. He could imagine Hinzelmann\u0027s pleasure in seeing the reference to his grandfather. He wondered if the old man knew that his family had been instrumental in building the lake. Shadow flipped forward through the book, scanning for more references to the lake-building project. They had dedicated the lake in a ceremony in the spring of 1876, as a precursor to the town\u0027s centennial celebrations. A vote of thanks to Mr. Hinzelmann was taken by the council. Shadow checked his watch. It was five-thirty. He went into the bathroom, shaved, combed his hair. He changed his clothes. Somehow the final fifteen minutes passed. He got the wine and the plant, arid he walked next door. The door opened as he knocked. Marguerite Olsen looked almost as nervous as he felt. She took the wine bottle and the potted plant, and said thank you. The television was on, The Wizard of Oz on video. It was still in sepia, and Dorothy was still in Kansas, sitting with her eyes closed in Professor Marvel\u0027s wagon as the old fraud pretended to read her mind, and the twister-wind that would tear her away from her life was approaching. Leon sat in front of the screen, playing with a toy fire truck. When he saw Shadow an expression of delight touched his face; he stood up and ran, tripping over his feet in his excitement, into a back bedroom, from which he emerged a moment later triumphantly waving a quarter. \"Watch, Mike Ainsel!\" he shouted. Then closed both his hands and he pretended to take the coin into his right hand, which he opened wide. \"I made it disappear, Mike Ainsel!\" \"You did,\" agreed Shadow. \"After we\u0027ve eaten, if it\u0027s okay with your mom, I\u0027ll show you how to do it even smoother than that.\" \"Do it now if you want,\" said Marguerite. \"We\u0027re still waiting for Samantha. I sent her out for sour cream. I don\u0027t know what\u0027s taking her so long.\" And, as if that was her cue, footsteps sounded on the wooden deck, and somebody shouldered open the front door. Shadow did not recognize her at first, then she said, \"I didn\u0027t know if you wanted the kind with calories or the kind that tastes like wallpaper paste so I went for the kind with calories,\" and he knew her then: the girl from the road to Cairo. \"That\u0027s fine,\" said Marguerite. \"Sam, this is my neighbor, Mike Ainsel. Mike, this is Samantha Black Crow, my sister.\" I don\u0027t know you, thought Shadow desperately. You\u0027ve never met me before. We\u0027re total strangers. He tried to remember how he had thought snow, how easy and light that had been: this was desperate. He put out his hand and said, \"Pleased to meetcha.\" She blinked, looked up at his face. A moment of puzzlement, then recognition entered her eyes and curved the corners of her mouth into a grin. \"Hello,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll see how the food is doing,\" said Marguerite, in the taut voice of someone who burns things in kitchens if they leave them alone and unwatched even for a moment. Sam took off her puffy coat and her hat. \"So you\u0027re the melancholy but mysterious neighbor,\" she said. \"Who\u0027da thunk it?\" She kept her voice down. \"And you,\" he said, \"are girl Sam. Can we talk about this later?\" \"If you promise to tell me what\u0027s going on.\" \"Deal.\" Leon tugged at the leg of Shadow\u0027s pants. \"Will you show me now?\" he asked, and held out his quarter. \"Okay,\" said Shadow. \"But if I show you, you have to remember that a master magician never tells anyone how it\u0027s done.\" \"I promise,\" said Leon, gravely. Shadow took the coin in his left hand, then moved Leon\u0027s right hand, showing him how to appear to take the coin in his right hand while actually leaving it in Shadow\u0027s left hand. Then he made Leon repeat the movements on his own. After several attempts the boy mastered the move. \"Now you know half of it,\" said Shadow. \"The other half is this: put your attention on the place where the coin ought to be. Look at the place it\u0027s meant to be. If you act like it\u0027s in your right hand, no one will even look at your left hand, no matter how clumsy you are.\" Sam watched all this with her head tipped slightly on one side, saying nothing. \"Dinner!\" called Marguerite, pushing her way in from the kitchen with a steaming bowl of spaghetti in her hands. \"Leon, go wash your hands.\" There was crusty garlic bread, thick red sauce, good spicy meatballs. Shadow complimented Marguerite on it. \"Old family recipe,\" she told him, \"from the Corsican side of the family.\" \"I thought you were Native American.\" \"Dad\u0027s Cherokee,\" said Sam. \"Mag\u0027s mom\u0027s father came from Corsica.\" Sam was the only person in the room who was actually drinking the cabernet. \"Dad left her when Mags was ten and he moved across town. Six months after that, I was born. Mom and Dad got married when the divorce came through. When I was ten he went away. I think he has a ten-year attention span.\" \"Well, he\u0027s been out in Oklahoma for ten years,\" said Marguerite. \"Now, my mom\u0027s family were European Jewish,\" continued Sam, \"from one of those places that used to be communist and now are just chaos. I think she liked the idea of being married to a Cherokee. Fry bread and chopped liver.\" She took another sip of the red wine. \"Sam\u0027s mom\u0027s a wild woman,\" said Marguerite, semi-approvingly. \"You know where she is now?\" asked Sam. Shadow shook his head. \"She\u0027s in Australia. She met a guy on the Internet who lived in Hobart. When they met in the flesh she decided he was actually kind of icky. But she really liked Tasmania. So she\u0027s living down there, with a woman\u0027s group, teaching them to batik cloth and things like that. Isn\u0027t that cool? At her age?\" Shadow agreed that it was, and helped himself to more meatballs. Sam told them how all the aboriginal natives of Tasmania had been wiped out by the British, and about the human chain they made across the island to catch them which trapped only an old man and a sick boy. She told him how the thylacines-the Tasmanian tigers-had been killed by farmers, scared for their sheep, how the politicians in the 1930s noticed that the thylacines should be protected only after the last of them was dead. She finished her second glass of wine, poured her third. \"So, Mike,\" said Sam, suddenly, her cheeks reddening, \"tell us about your family. What are the Ainsels like?\" She was smiling, and there was mischief in that smile. \"We\u0027re real dull,\" said Shadow. \"None of us ever got as far as Tasmania. So you\u0027re at school in Madison. What\u0027s that like?\" \"You know,\" she said. \"I\u0027m studying art history, women\u0027s studies, and casting my own bronzes.\" \"When I grow up,\" said Leon, \"I\u0027m going to do magic. Poof. Will you teach me, Mike Ainsel?\" \"Sure,\" said Shadow. \"If your mom doesn\u0027t mind.\" Sam said, \"After we\u0027ve eaten, while you\u0027re putting Leon to bed, Mags, I think I\u0027m going to get Mike to take me to the Buck Stops Here for an hour or so.\" Marguerite did not shrug. Her head moved, her eyebrow raised slightly. \"I think he\u0027s interesting,\" said Sam. \"And we have lots to talk about.\" Marguerite looked at Shadow, who busied himself in dabbing an imaginary blob of red sauce from his chin with a paper napkin. \"Well, you\u0027re grownups,\" she said, in a tone of voice that implied that they weren\u0027t, and that even if they were they shouldn\u0027t be. After dinner Shadow helped Sam with the washing up-he dried-and then he did a trick for Leon, counting pennies into Leon\u0027s palm: each time Leon opened his hand and counted them there was one less coin than he had counted in. And as for the final penny-\"Are you squeezing it? Tightly?\"-when Leon opened his hand he found it had transformed into a dime. Leon\u0027s plaintive cries of \"How\u0027d you do that? Momma, how\u0027d he do that?\" followed him out into the hall. Sam handed him his coat. \"Come on,\" she said. Her cheeks were flushed from the wine. Outside it was cold. Shadow stopped in his apartment, tossed the Minutes of the Lakeside City Council into a plastic grocery bag, and brought it along. Hinzelmann might be down at the Buck, and he wanted to show him the mention of his grandfather. They walked down the drive side by side. He opened the garage door, and she started to laugh. \"Omigod,\" she said, when she saw the 4-Runner. \"Paul Gunther\u0027s car. You bought Paul Gunther\u0027s car. Omigod.\" Shadow opened the door for her. Then he went around and got in. \"You know the car?\" \"When I came up here two or three years ago to stay with Mags. It was me that persuaded him to paint it purple.\" \"Oh,\" said Shadow. \"It\u0027s good to have someone to blame.\" He drove the car out onto the street. Got out and closed the garage door. Got back into the car. Sam was looking at him oddly as he got in, as if the confidence had begun to leak out of her. He put on his seat belt, and she said, \"Okay. This is a stupid thing to do, isn\u0027t it? Getting into a car with a psycho killer.\" \"I got you home safe last time,\" said Shadow. \"You killed two men,\" she said. \"You\u0027re wanted by the feds. And now I find out you\u0027re living under an assumed name next door to my sister. Unless Mike Ainsel is your real name?\" \"No,\" said Shadow, and he sighed. \"It\u0027s not.\" He hated saying it. It was as if he was letting go of something important, abandoning Mike Ainsel by denying him; as if he were taking his leave of a friend. \"Did you kill those men?\" \"No.\" \"They came to my house, and said we\u0027d been seen together. And this guy showed me photographs of you. What was his name-Mister Hat? No. Mister Town. It was like The Fugitive. But I said I hadn\u0027t seen you.\" \"Thank you.\" \"So,\" she said. \"Tell me what\u0027s going on. I\u0027ll keep your secrets if you keep mine.\" \"I don\u0027t know any of yours,\" said Shadow. \"Well, you know that it was my idea to paint this thing purple, thus forcing Paul Gunther to become such an object of scorn and derision for several counties around that he was forced to leave town entirely. We were kind of stoned,\" she admitted. \"I doubt that bit of it\u0027s much of a secret,\" said Shadow. \"Everyone in Lakeside must have known. It\u0027s a stoner sort of purple.\" And then she said, very quiet, very fast, \"If you\u0027re going to kill me please don\u0027t hurt me. I shouldn\u0027t have come here with you. I am so fucking fucking dumb. I can identify you. Jesus.\" Shadow sighed. \"I\u0027ve never killed anybody. Really. Now I\u0027m going to take you to the Buck,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll have a drink. Or if you give the word, I\u0027ll turn this car around and take you home. Either way, I\u0027ll just have to hope you aren\u0027t going to call the cops.\" There was silence as they crossed the bridge. \"Who did kill those men?\" she asked. \"You wouldn\u0027t believe me if I told you.\" \"I would.\" She sounded angry now. He wondered if bringing the wine to the dinner had been a wise idea. Life was certainly not a cabernet right now. \"It\u0027s not easy to believe.\" \"I,\" she told him, \"can believe anything. You have no idea what I can believe.\" \"Really?\" \"I can believe things that are true and I can believe things that aren\u0027t true and I can believe things where nobody knows if they\u0027re true or not. I can believe in Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny and Marilyn Monroe and the Beatles and Elvis and Mister Ed. Listen-I believe that people are perfectible, that knowledge is infinite, that the world is run by secret banking cartels and is visited by aliens on a regular basis, nice ones that look like wrinkledy lemurs and bad ones who mutilate cattle and want our water and our women. I believe that the future sucks and I believe that the future rocks and I believe that one day White Buffalo Woman is going to come back and kick everyone\u0027s ass. I believe that all men are just overgrown boys with deep problems communicating and that the decline in good sex in America is coincident with the decline in drive-in movie theaters from state to state. I believe that all politicians are unprincipled crooks and I still believe that they are better than the alternative. I believe that California is going to sink into the sea when the big one comes, while Florida is going to dissolve into madness and alligators and toxic waste. I believe that antibacterial soap is destroying our resistance to dirt and disease so that one day we\u0027ll all be wiped out by the common cold like the Martians in War of the Worlds. I believe that the greatest poets of the last century were Edith Sitwell and Don Marquis, that jade is dried dragon sperm, and that thousands of years ago in a former life I was a one-armed Siberian shaman. I believe that mankind\u0027s destiny lies in the stars. I believe that candy really did taste better when I was a kid, that it\u0027s aerodynamically impossible for a bumblebee to fly, that light is a wave and a particle, that there\u0027s a cat in a box somewhere who\u0027s alive and dead at the same time (although if they don\u0027t ever open the box to feed it it\u0027ll eventually just be two different kinds of dead), and that there are stars in the universe billions of years older than the universe itself. I believe in a personal god who cares about me and worries and oversees everything I do. I believe in an impersonal god who set the universe in motion and went off to hang with her girlfriends and doesn\u0027t even know that I\u0027m alive. I believe in an empty and godless universe of causal chaos, background noise, and sheer blind luck. I believe that anyone who says that sex is overrated just hasn\u0027t done it properly. I believe that anyone who claims to know what\u0027s going on will lie about the little things too. I believe in absolute honesty and sensible social lies. I believe in a woman\u0027s right to choose, a baby\u0027s right to live, that while all human life is sacred there\u0027s nothing wrong with the death penalty if you can trust the legal system implicitly, and that no one but a moron would ever trust the legal system. I believe that life is a game, that life is a cruel joke, and that life is what happens when you\u0027re alive and that you might as well lie back and enjoy it.\" She stopped, out of breath. Shadow almost took his hands off the wheel to applaud. Instead he said, \"Okay. So if I tell you what I\u0027ve learned you won\u0027t think that I\u0027m a nut.\" \"Maybe,\" she said. \"Try me.\" \"Would you believe that all the gods that people have ever imagined are still with us today?\" \"...Maybe.\" \"And that there are new gods out there, gods of computers and telephones and whatever, and that they all seem to think there isn\u0027t room for them both in the world. And that some kind of war is kind of likely.\" \"And these gods killed those two men?\" \"No, my wife killed those two men.\" \"I thought you said your wife was dead.\" \"She is.\" \"She killed them before she died, then?\" \"After. Don\u0027t ask.\" She reached up a hand and flicked her hair from her forehead. They pulled up on Main Street, outside the Buck Stops Here. The sign over the window showed a surprised-looking stag standing on its hind legs holding a glass of beer. Shadow grabbed the bag with the book in it and got out. \"Why would they have a war?\" asked Sam. \"It seems kind of redundant. What is there to win?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" admitted Shadow. \"It\u0027s easier to believe in aliens than in gods,\" said Sam. \"Maybe Mister Town and Mister Whatever were Men in Black, only the alien kind.\" They were standing on the sidewalk outside the Buck Stops Here and Sam stopped. She looked up at Shadow, and her breath hung on the night air like a faint cloud. She said, \"Just tell me you\u0027re one of the good guys.\" \"I can\u0027t,\" said Shadow. \"I wish I could. But I\u0027m doing my best.\" She looked up at him, and bit her lower lip. Then she nodded. \"Good enough,\" she said. \"I won\u0027t turn you in. You can buy me a beer.\" Shadow pushed the door open for her, and they were hit by a blast of heat and music. They went inside. Sam waved at some friends. Shadow nodded to a handful of people whose faces-although not their names-he remembered from the day he had spent searching for Alison McGovern, or who he had met in Mabel\u0027s in the morning. Chad Mulligan was standing at the bar, with his arm around the shoulders of a small red-haired woman-the kissing cousin, Shadow figured. He wondered what she looked like, but she had her back to him. Chad\u0027s hand raised in a mock salute when he saw Shadow. Shadow grinned, and waved back at him. Shadow looked around for Hinzelmann, but the old man did not seem to be there this evening. He spied a free table at the back and started walking toward it. Then somebody began to scream. It was a bad scream, a full-throated, seen-a-ghost hysterical scream, which silenced all conversation. Shadow looked around, certain somebody was being murdered, and then he realized that all the faces in the bar were turning toward him. Even the black cat, who slept in the window during the day, was standing up on top of the jukebox with its tail high and its back arched and was staring at Shadow. Time slowed. \"Get him!\" shouted a woman\u0027s voice, parked on the verge of hysteria. \"Oh for God\u0027s sake, somebody stop him! Don\u0027t let him get away! Please!\" It was a voice he knew. Nobody moved. They stared at Shadow. He stared back at them. Chad Mulligan stepped forward, walking through the people. The small woman walked behind him warily, her eyes wide, as if she was preparing to start screaming once more. Shadow knew her. Of course he knew her. Chad was still holding his beer, which he put down on a nearby table. He said, \"Mike.\" Shadow said, \"Chad.\" Audrey Burton took hold of Chad\u0027s sleeve. Her face was white, and there were tears in her eyes. \"Shadow,\" she said. \"You bastard. You murderous evil bastard.\" \"Are you sure that you know this man, hon?\" said Chad. He looked uncomfortable. Audrey Burton looked at him incredulously. \"Are you crazy? He worked for Robbie for years. His slutty wife was my best friend. He\u0027s wanted for murder. I had to answer questions. He\u0027s an escaped convict.\" She was way over the top, her voice trembling with suppressed hysteria, sobbing out her words like a soap actress going for a daytime Emmy. Kissing cousins, thought Shadow, unimpressed. Nobody in the bar said a word. Chad Mulligan looked up at Shadow. \"It\u0027s probably a mistake. I\u0027m sure we can sort this all out,\" he said. Then he said, to the bar, \"It\u0027s all fine. Nothing to worry about. We can sort this out. Everything\u0027s fine.\" Then, to Shadow, \"Let\u0027s step outside, Mike.\" Quiet competence. Shadow was impressed. \"Sure,\" said Shadow. He felt a hand touch his hand, and he turned to see Sam staring at him. He smiled down at her as reassuringly as he could. Sam looked at Shadow, then she looked around the bar at the faces staring at them. She said to Audrey Burton, \"I don\u0027t know who you are. But. You. Are such. A cunt.\" Then she went up on tiptoes and pulled Shadow down to her, and kissed him hard on the lips, pushing her mouth against his for what felt to Shadow like several minutes, and might have been as long as five seconds in real, clock-ticking time. It was a strange kiss, Shadow thought, as her lips pressed against his: it wasn\u0027t intended for him. It was for the other people in the bar, to let them know that she had picked sides. It was a flag-waving kiss. Even as she kissed him, he became certain that she didn\u0027t even like him-well, not like that. Still, there was a tale he had read once, long ago, as a small boy: the story of a traveler who had slipped down a cliff, with man-eating tigers above him and a lethal fall below him, who managed to stop his fall halfway down the side of the cliff, holding on for dear life. There was a clump of strawberries beside him, and certain death above him and below. What should he do? went the question. And the reply was, Eat the strawberries. The story had never made any sense to him as a boy. It did now. So he closed his eyes, threw himself into the kiss and experienced nothing but Sam\u0027s lips and the softness of her skin against his, sweet as a wild strawberry. \"C\u0027mon Mike,\" said Chad Mulligan, firmly. \"Please. Let\u0027s take it outside.\" Sam pulled back. She licked her lips, and smiled, a smile that nearly reached her eyes. \"Not bad,\" she said. \"You kiss good for a boy. Okay, go play outside.\" Then she turned to Audrey Burton. \"But you,\" she said, \"are still a cunt.\" Shadow tossed Sam his car keys. She caught them, one-handed. He walked through the bar and stepped outside, followed by Chad Mulligan. A gentle snow had begun to fall, the flakes spinning down into the light of the neon bar sign. \"You want to talk about this?\" asked Chad. Audrey had followed them out onto the sidewalk. She looked as if she were ready to start screaming again. She said, \"He killed two men, Chad. The FBI came to my door. He\u0027s a psycho. I\u0027ll come down to the station with you, if you want.\" \"You\u0027ve caused enough trouble, ma\u0027am,\" said Shadow. He sounded tired, even to himself. \"Please go away.\" \"Chad? Did you hear that? He threatened me!\" said Audrey. \"Get back inside, Audrey,\" said Chad Mulligan. She looked as if she were about to argue, then she pressed her lips together so hard they went white, and went back into the bar. \"Would you like to comment on anything she said?\" asked Chad Mulligan. \"I\u0027ve never killed anyone,\" said Shadow. Chad nodded. \"I believe you,\" he said. \"I\u0027m sure we can deal with these allegations easily enough. You won\u0027t give me any trouble, will you, Mike?\" \"No trouble,\" said Shadow. \"This is all a mistake.\" \"Exactly,\" said Chad. \"So I figure we ought to head down to my office and sort it all out there?\" \"Am I under arrest?\" asked Shadow. \"Nope,\" said Chad. \"Not unless you want to be. I figure, you come with me out of a sense of civic duty, and we\u0027ll straighten all this out.\" Chad patted Shadow down, found no weapons. They got into Mulligan\u0027s car. Again Shadow sat in the back, looking out through the metal cage. He thought, SOS. Mayday. Help. He tried to push Mulligan with his mind, as he\u0027d once pushed a cop in Chicago-This is your old friend Mike Ainsel. You saved his life. Don\u0027t you know how silly this is? Why don\u0027t you just drop the whole thing? \"I figure it was good to get you out of there,\" said Chad. \"All you needed was some loudmouth deciding that you were Alison McGovern\u0027s killer and we\u0027d\u0027ve had a lynch mob on our hands.\" \"Point.\" They were silent for the rest of the drive to the Lakeside police building, which, Chad said as they pulled up outside it, actually belonged to the county sheriff\u0027s department. The local police made do with a few rooms in there. Pretty soon the county would build something modern. For now they had to make do with what they had. They walked inside. \"Should I call a lawyer?\" asked Shadow. \"You aren\u0027t accused of anything,\" said Mulligan. \"Up to you.\" They pushed through some swing doors. \"Take a seat over there.\" Shadow took a seat on the wooden chair with cigarette burns on the side. He felt stupid and numb. There was a small poster on the notice board, beside a large NO SMOKING sign: ENDANGERED MISSING it said. The photograph was Alison McGovern\u0027s. There was a wooden table with old copies of Sports Illustrated and Newsweek on it. The light was bad. The paint on the wall was yellow, but it might once have been white. After ten minutes Chad brought him a watery cup of vending machine hot chocolate. \"What\u0027s in the bag?\" he asked. And it was only then that Shadow realized he was still holding the plastic bag containing the Minutes of the Lakeside City Council. \"Old book,\" said Shadow. \"Your grandfather\u0027s picture\u0027s in here. Or great-grandfather maybe.\" \"Yeah?\" Shadow flipped through the book until he found the portrait of the town council, and he pointed to the man called Mulligan. Chad chuckled. \"If that don\u0027t beat all,\" he said. Minutes passed, and hours, in that room. Shadow read two of the Sports Illustrateds and he started in on the Newsweek. From time to time Chad would come through, once checking to see if Shadow needed to use the rest room, once to offer him a ham roll and a small packet of potato chips. \"Thanks,\" said Shadow, taking them. \"Am I under arrest yet?\" Chad sucked the air between his teeth. \"Well,\" he said, \"not yet. It doesn\u0027t look like you came by the name Mike Ainsel legally. On the other hand, you can call yourself whatever you want in this state, if it\u0027s not for fraudulent purposes. You just hang loose.\" \"Can I make a phone call?\" \"Is it a local call?\" \"Long distance.\" \"It\u0027ll save money if I put it on my calling card, otherwise you\u0027ll just be feeding ten bucks worth of quarters into that thing in the hall.\" Sure, thought Shadow. And this way you\u0027ll know the number I dialed, and you\u0027ll probably be listening in on an extension. \"That would be great,\" said Shadow. They wait into an empty office. The number Shadow gave Chad to dial for him was that of a funeral home in Cairo, Illinois. Chad dialed it, handed Shadow the receiver. \"I\u0027ll leave you in here,\" he said, and went out. The telephone rang several times, then it was picked up. \"Jacquel and Ibis? Can I help you?\" \"Hi. Mister Ibis, this is Mike Ainsel. I helped out there for a few days over Christmas.\" A moment\u0027s hesitation, then, \"Of course. Mike. How are you?\" \"Not great, Mister Ibis. In a patch of trouble. About to be arrested. Hoping you\u0027d seen my uncle about, or maybe you could get a message to him.\" \"I can certainly ask around. Hold on, uh, Mike. There\u0027s someone here who wishes a word with you.\" The phone was passed to somebody, and then a smoky female voice said \"Hi, honey. I miss you.\" He was certain he\u0027d never heard that voice before. But he knew her. He was sure that he knew her... Let it go, the smoky voice whispered in his mind, in a dream. Let it all go. \"Who\u0027s that girl you were kissing, hon? You trying to make me jealous?\" \"We\u0027re just friends,\" said Shadow. \"I think she was trying to prove a point. How did you know she kissed me?\" \"I got eyes wherever my folk walk,\" she said. \"You take care now, hon...\" There was a moment of silence, then Mr. Ibis came back on the line and said, \"Mike?\" \"Yes.\" \"There\u0027s a problem getting hold of your uncle. He seems to be kind of tied up. But I\u0027ll try and get a message to your aunt Nancy. Best of luck.\" The line went dead. Shadow sat down, expecting Chad to return. He sat in the empty office, wishing he had something to distract him. Reluctantly, he picked up the Minutes once more, opened it to somewhere in the middle of the book, and began to read. An ordinance prohibiting expectoration on sidewalks and on the floors of public buildings, or throwing thereon tobacco in any form was introduced and passed, eight to four, in December of 1876. Lemmi Hautala was twelve years old and had, \"it was feared, wandered away in a fit of delirium\" on December 13, 1876. \"A search being immediately effected, but impeded by the snows, which are blinding.\" The council had voted unanimously to send the Hautala family their condolences. The fire at Olsen\u0027s livery stables the following week was extinguished without any injury or loss of life, human or equine. Shadow scanned the closely printed columns. He found no further mention of Lemmi Hautala. And then, on something slightly more than a whim, Shadow flipped the pages forward to the winter of 1877. He found what he was looking for mentioned as an aside in the January minutes: Jessie Lovat, age not given, \"a Negro child,\" had vanished on the night of December 28. It was believed that she might have been \"abducted by traveling so-called pedlars.\" Condolences were not sent to the Lovat family. Shadow was scanning the minutes of winter 1878 when Chad Mulligan knocked and entered, looking shamefaced, like a child bringing home a bad report card. \"Mister Ainsel,\" he said. \"Mike. I\u0027m truly sorry about this. Personally, I like you. But that don\u0027t change anything, you know?\" Shadow said he knew. \"I got no choice in the matter,\" said Chad, \"but to place you under arrest for violating your parole.\" Then Mulligan read Shadow his rights. He filled out some paperwork. He took Shadow\u0027s prints. He walked him down the hall to the county jail, on the other side of the building. There was a long counter and several doorways on one side of the room, two glassed-in holding cells and a doorway on the other. One of the cells was occupied-a man slept on a cement bed under a thin blanket. The other was empty. There was a sleepy-looking woman in a brown uniform behind the counter, watching Jay Leno on a small white portable television. She took the papers from Chad, and signed for Shadow. Chad hung around, filled in more papers. The woman came around the counter, patted Shadow down, took all his possessions-wallet, coins, front door key, book, watch-and put them on the counter, then gave him a plastic bag with orange clothes in it and told him to go into the open cell and change into them. He could keep his own underwear and socks. He went in and changed into the orange clothes and the shower footwear. It stank evilly in there. The orange top he pulled over his head had LUMBER COUNTY JAIL written on the back in large black letters. The metal toilet in the cell had backed up, and was filled to the brim with a brown stew of liquid feces and sour, beerish urine. Shadow came back out, gave the woman his clothes, which she put into the plastic bag with the rest of his possessions. He had thumbed through the wallet before he handed it over. \"You take care of this,\" he had said to the woman. \"My whole life is in here.\" The woman took the wallet from him, and assured him that it would be safe with them. She asked Chad if that wasn\u0027t true, and Chad, looking up from the last of his paperwork, said Liz was telling the truth, they\u0027d never lost a prisoner\u0027s possessions yet. Shadow had slipped the four hundred-dollar bills that he had palmed from the wallet into his socks, when he had changed, along with the silver Liberty dollar he had palmed as he had emptied his pockets. \"Say,\" Shadow asked, when he came out. \"Would it be okay if I finished reading the book?\" \"Sorry, Mike. Rules are rules,\" said Chad. Liz put Shadow\u0027s possessions in a bag in the back room. Chad said he\u0027d leave Shadow in Officer Bute\u0027s capable hands. Liz looked tired and unimpressed. Chad left. The telephone rang, and Liz-Officer Bute-answered it. \"Okay,\" she said. \"Okay. No problem. Okay. No problem. Okay.\" She put down the phone and made a face. \"Problem?\" asked Shadow. \"Yes. Not really. Kinda. They\u0027re sending someone up from Milwaukee to collect you.\" \"Why is that a problem?\" \"I got to keep you in here with me for three hours,\" she said. \"And the cell over there\"-she pointed to the cell by the door, with the sleeping man in it-\"that\u0027s occupied. He\u0027s on suicide watch. I shouldn\u0027t put you in with him. But it\u0027s not worth the trouble to sign you in to the county and then sign you out again.\" She shook her head. \"And you don\u0027t want to go in there\"-she pointed to the empty cell in which he\u0027d changed his clothes-\"because the can is shot. It stinks in there, doesn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes. It was gross.\" \"It\u0027s common humanity, that\u0027s what it is. The sooner we get into the new facilities, it can\u0027t be too soon for me. One of the women we had in yesterday must\u0027ve flushed a tampon away. I tell \u0027em not to. We got bins for that. They clog the pipes. Every damn tampon down that John costs the county a hundred bucks in plumbers\u0027 fees. So, I can keep you out here, if I cuff you. Or you can go in the cell.\" She looked at him. \"Your call,\" she said. \"I\u0027m not crazy about them,\" he said. \"But I\u0027ll take the cuffs.\" She took a pair from her utility belt, then patted the semiautomatic in its holster, as if to remind him that it was there. \"Hands behind your back,\" she said. The cuffs were a tight fit: he had big wrists. Then she put hobbles on his ankles and sat him down on a bench on the far side of the counter, against the wall. \"Now,\" she said. \"You don\u0027t bother me, and I won\u0027t bother you.\" She tilted the television so that he could see it. \"Thanks,\" he said. \"When we get our new offices,\" she said, \"there won\u0027t be none of this nonsense.\" The Tonight Show finished. An episode of Cheers began. Shadow had never watched Cheers. He had only ever seen one episode of it-the one where Coach\u0027s daughter comes to the bar-although he had seen that several times. Shadow had noticed that you only ever catch one episode of shows you don\u0027t watch, over and over, years apart; he thought it must be some kind of cosmic law. Officer Liz Bute sat back in her chair. She was not obviously dozing, but she was by no means awake, so she did not notice when the gang at Cheers stopped talking and getting off one-liners and just started staring out of the screen at Shadow. Diane, the blonde barmaid who fancied herself an intellectual, was the first to talk. \"Shadow,\" she said. \"We were so worried about you. You\u0027d fallen off the world. It\u0027s so good to see you again-albeit in bondage and orange couture.\" \"What I figure is the thing to do,\" pontificated bar bore Cliff, \"is to escape in hunting season, when everybody\u0027s wearing orange anyway.\" Shadow said nothing. \"Ah, cat got your tongue, I see,\" said Diane. \"Well, you\u0027ve led us a merry chase!\" Shadow looked away. Officer Liz had begun, gently, to snore. Carla, the little waitress, snapped, \"Hey, jerk-wad! We interrupt this broadcast to show you something that\u0027s going to make you piss in your friggin\u0027 pants. You ready?\" The screen flickered and went black. The words LIVE FEED pulsated in white at the bottom left of screen. A subdued female voice said, in voice-over, \"It\u0027s certainly not too late to change to the winning side. But you know, you also have the freedom to stay just where you are. That\u0027s what it means to be an American. That\u0027s the miracle of America. Freedom to believe means the freedom to believe the wrong thing, after all. Just as freedom of speech gives you the right to stay silent.\" The picture now showed a street scene. The camera lurched forward, in the manner of handheld video cameras in real-life documentaries. A man with thinning hair, a tan, and a faintly hangdog expression filled the frame. He was standing by a wall sipping a cup of coffee from a plastic cup. He looked into the camera, and said, \"Terrorists hide behind weasel words, like \u0027freedom fighter.\u0027 You and I know that they are murdering scum, pure and simple. We\u0027re risking our lives to make a difference.\" Shadow recognized the voice. He had been inside the man\u0027s head once. Mr. Town sounded different from inside, his voice was deeper, more resonant-but there was no mistaking it. The cameras pulled back to show that Mr. Town was standing outside a brick building on an American street. Above the door was a set-square and compass framing the letter G. \"In position,\" said somebody offscreen. \"Let\u0027s see if the cameras inside the hall are rolling,\" said the female voice-over voice. The words LIVE FEED continued to blink at the bottom left of the screen. Now the picture showed the interior of a small hall: the room was underlit. Two men sat at a table at the far end of the room. One of them had his back to the camera. The camera zoomed in to them awkwardly. For a moment they were out of focus, and then they became sharp once more. The man facing the camera got up and began to pace, like a bear on a chain. It was Wednesday. He looked as if, on some level, he was enjoying this. As they came into focus the sound came on with a pop. The man with his back to the screen was saying, \"-we are offering is the chance to end this, here and now, with no more bloodshed, no more aggression, no more pain, no more loss of life. Isn\u0027t that worth giving up a little?\" Wednesday stopped pacing and turned. His nostrils flared. \"First,\" he growled, \"you have to understand that you are asking me to speak for all of us. Which is manifestly nonsensical. Secondly, what on earth makes you think that I believe that you people are going to keep your word?\" The man with his back to the camera moved his head. \"You do yourself an injustice,\" he said. \"Obviously you people have no leaders. But you\u0027re the one they listen to. They pay attention to you. And as for keeping my word, well, these preliminary talks are being filmed and broadcast live,\" and he gestured back toward the camera. \"Some of your people are watching as we speak. Others will see videotapes. The camera does not lie.\" \"Everybody lies,\" said Wednesday. Shadow recognized the voice of the man with his back to the camera. It was Mr. World, the one who had spoken to Town on the cellphone while Shadow was in Town\u0027s head. \"You don\u0027t believe,\" said Mr. World, \"that we will keep our word?\" \"I think your promises were made to be broken and your oaths to be forsworn. But I will keep my word.\" \"Safe conduct is safe conduct,\" said Mr. World, \"and a flag of truce is what we agreed. I should tell you, by the way, that your young protégé is once more in our custody.\" Wednesday snorted. \"No,\" he said. \"He\u0027s not.\" \"We were discussing the ways to deal with the coming paradigm shift. We don\u0027t have to be enemies. Do we?\" Wednesday seemed shaken. He said, \"I will do whatever is in my power...\" Shadow noticed something strange about the image of Wednesday on the television screen. A red glint burned on his left eye, the glass one. The dot left a phosphor-dot afterimage as he moved. He seemed unaware of it. \"It\u0027s a big country,\" said Wednesday, marshaling his thoughts. He moved his head and the red laser-pointer dot slipped to his cheek. Then it edged up to his glass eye once more. \"There is room for-\" There was a bang, muted by the television speakers, and the side of Wednesday\u0027s head exploded. His body tumbled backward. Mr. World stood up, his back still to the camera, and walked out of shot. \"Let\u0027s see that again, in slow motion this time,\" said the announcer\u0027s voice, reassuringly. The words LIVE FEED became REPLAY. Slowly now the red laser pointer traced its bead onto Wednesday\u0027s glass eye, and once again the side of his face dissolved into a cloud of blood. Freeze frame. \"Yes, it\u0027s still God\u0027s Own Country,\" said the announcer, a news reporter pronouncing the final tag line. \"The only question is, which gods?\" Another voice-Shadow thought that it was Mr. World\u0027s, it had that same half-familiar quality-said, \"We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.\" On Cheers, Coach assured his daughter that she was truly beautiful, just like her mother. The telephone rang, and Officer Liz sat up with a start. She picked it up. Said, \"Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay.\" Put the phone down. She got up from behind the counter, and said to Shadow, \"I\u0027m going to have to put you in the cell. Don\u0027t use the can. The Lafayette sheriff\u0027s department should be here to collect you soon.\" She removed the cuffs and the hobble, locked him into the holding cell. The smell was worse, now that the door was closed. Shadow sat down on the concrete bed, slipped the Liberty dollar from his sock, and began moving it from finger to palm, from position to position, from hand to hand, his only aim to keep the coin from being seen by anyone who might look in. He was passing the time. He was numb. He missed Wednesday, then, sudden, and deep. He missed the man\u0027s confidence, his attitude. His conviction. He opened his hand, looked down at Lady Liberty, a silver profile. He closed his fingers over the coin, held it tightly. He wondered if he\u0027d get to be one of those guys who got life for something they didn\u0027t do. If he even made it that far. From what he\u0027d seen of Mr. World and Mr. Town, they would have little trouble pulling him out of the system. Perhaps he\u0027d suffer an unfortunate accident on the way to the next holding facility. He could be shot while making a break for it. It did not seem at all unlikely. There was a stir of activity in the room on the other side of the glass. Officer Liz came back in. She pressed a button, a door that Shadow could not see opened, and a black deputy in a brown sheriff\u0027s uniform entered and walked briskly over to the desk. Shadow slipped the dollar coin back into his sock. The new deputy handed over some papers, Liz scanned them and signed. Chad Mulligan came in, said a few words to the new man, then he unlocked the cell door and walked inside. \"Okay. Folk are here to pick you up. Seems you\u0027re a matter of national security. You know that?\" \"It\u0027ll make a great front-page story for the Lakeside News,\" said Shadow. Chad looked at him without expression. \"That a drifter got picked up for parole violations? Not much of a story.\" \"So that\u0027s the way it is?\" \"That\u0027s what they tell me,\" said Chad Mulligan. Shadow put his hands in front of him this time, and Chad cuffed him. Chad locked on the ankle hobbles, and a rod from the cuffs to the hobbles. Shadow thought, They\u0027ll take me outside. Maybe I can make a break for it-in hobbles and cuffs and lightweight orange clothes, out into the snow, and even as he thought it he knew how stupid and hopeless it was. Chad walked him out into the office. Liz had turned the TV off now. The black deputy looked him over. \"He\u0027s a big guy,\" he said to Chad. Liz passed the new deputy the paper bag with Shadow\u0027s possessions in it, and he signed for it. Chad looked at Shadow, then at the deputy. He said to the deputy, quietly, but loudly enough for Shadow to hear, \"Look. I just want to say, I\u0027m not comfortable with the way this is happening.\" The deputy nodded. \"You\u0027ll have to take it up with the appropriate authorities, sir. Our job is simply to bring him in.\" Chad made a sour face. He turned to Shadow. \"Okay,\" said Chad. \"Through that door and into the sally port.\" \"What?\" \"Out there. Where the car is.\" Liz unlocked the doors. \"You make sure that orange uniform comes right back here,\" she said to the deputy. \"The last felon we sent down to Lafayette, we never saw the uniform again. They cost the county money.\" They walked Shadow out to the sally port, where a car sat idling. It wasn\u0027t a sheriff\u0027s department car. It was a black town car. Another deputy, a grizzled white guy with a mustache, stood by the car, smoking a cigarette. He crushed it out underfoot as they came close, and opened the back door for Shadow. Shadow sat down, awkwardly, his movements hampered by the cuffs and the hobble. There was no grille between the back and the front of the car. The two deputies climbed into the front of the car. The black deputy started the motor. They waited for the sally port door to open. \"Come on, come on,\" said the black deputy, his fingers drumming against the steering wheel. Chad Mulligan tapped on the side window. The white deputy glanced at the driver, then he lowered-the window. \"This is wrong,\" said Chad. \"I just wanted to say that.\" \"Your comments have been noted, and will be conveyed to the appropriate authorities,\" said the driver. The doors to the outside world opened. The snow was still falling, dizzying into the car\u0027s headlights. The driver put his foot on the gas, and they were heading back down the street and on to Main Street. \"You heard about Wednesday?\" said the driver. His voice sounded different, now, older, and familiar. \"He\u0027s dead.\" \"Yeah. I know,\" said Shadow. \"I saw it on TV.\" \"Those fuckers,\" said the white officer. It was the first thing he had said, and his voice was rough and accented and, like the driver\u0027s, it was a voice that Shadow knew. \"I tell you, they are fuckers, those fuckers.\" \"Thanks for coming to get me,\" said Shadow. \"Don\u0027t mention it,\" said the driver. In the light of an oncoming car his face already seemed to look older. He looked smaller, too. The last time Shadow had seen him he had been wearing lemon-yellow gloves and a check jacket. \"We were in Milwaukee. Had to drive like demons when Ibis called.\" \"You think we let them lock you up and send you to the chair, when I\u0027m still waiting to break your head with my hammer?\" asked the white deputy gloomily, fumbling in his pocket for a pack of cigarettes. His accent was Eastern European. \"The real shit will hit the fan in an hour or less,\" said Mr. Nancy, looking more like himself with each moment, \"when they really turn up to collect you. We\u0027ll pull over before we get to Highway 53 and get you out of those shackles and back into your own clothes.\" Czernobog held up a handcuff key and smiled. \"I like the mustache,\" said Shadow. \"Suits you.\" Czernobog stroked it with a yellowed finger. \"Thank you.\" \"Wednesday,\" said Shadow. \"Is he really dead? This isn\u0027t some kind of trick, is it?\" He realized that he had been holding on to some kind of hope, foolish though it was. But the expression on Nancy\u0027s face told him all he needed to know, and the hope was gone. COMING TO AMERICA 14,000 B.C. Cold it was, and dark, when the vision came to her, for in the far north daylight was a gray dim time in the middle of the day that came, and went, and came again: an interlude between darknesses. They were not a large tribe as these things were counted then: nomads of the Northern Plains. They had a god, who was the skull of a mammoth, and the hide of a mammoth fashioned into a rough cloak. Nunyunnini, they called him. When they were not traveling, he rested on a wooden frame, at man height. She was the holy woman of the tribe, the keeper of its secrets, and her name was Atsula, the fox. Atsula walked before the two tribesmen who carried their god on long poles, draped with bearskins, that it should not be seen by profane eyes, nor at times when it was not holy. They roamed the tundra, with their tents. The finest of the tents was made of caribou hide, and it was the holy tent, and there were four of them inside it: Atsula, the priestess, Gugwei, the tribal elder, Yanu, the war leader, and Kalanu, the scout. She called them there, the day after she had her vision. Atsula scraped some lichen into the fire, then she threw in dried leaves with her withered left hand: they smoked, with an eye-stinging gray smoke, and gave off an odor that was sharp and strange. Then she took a wooden cup from the wooden platform, and she passed it to Gugwei. The cup was half filled with a dark yellow liquid. Atsula had found the pungh mushrooms, each with seven spots, only a true holy woman could find a seven-spotted mushroom-and had picked them at the dark of the moon, and dried them on a string of deer cartilage. Yesterday, before she slept, she had eaten the three dried mushroom caps. Her dreams had been confused and fearful things, of bright lights moving fast, of rock mountains filled with lights spearing upward like icicles. In the night she had woken, sweating, and needing to make water. She squatted over the wooden cup and filled it with her urine. Then she placed the cup outside the tent, in the snow, and returned to sleep. When she woke, she picked the lumps of ice out from the wooden cup, leaving a darker, more concentrated liquid behind. It was this liquid she passed around, first to Gugwei, then to Yanu and to Kalanu. Each of them took a large gulp of the liquid, then Atsula took the final draft. She swallowed it, and poured what was left on the ground in front of their god, a libation to Nunyunnini. They sat in the smoky tent, waiting for their god to speak. Outside, in the darkness, the wind wailed and breathed. Kalanu, the scout, was a woman who dressed and walked as a man: she had even taken Dalani, a fourteen-year-old maiden, to be her wife. Kalanu blinked her eyes tightly, then she got up and walked over to the mammoth skull. She pulled the mammoth-hide cloak over herself, and stood so her head was inside the mammoth skull. \"There is evil in the land,\" said Nunyunnini in Kalanu\u0027s voice. \"Evil, such that if you stay here, in the land of your mothers and your mother\u0027s mothers, you shall all perish.\" The three listeners grunted. \"Is it the slavers? Or the great wolves?\" asked Gugwei, whose hair was long and white, and whose face was as wrinkled as the gray skin of a thorn tree. \"It is not the slavers,\" said Nunyunnini, old stone-hide. \"It is not the great wolves.\" \"Is it a famine? Is a famine coming?\" asked Gugwei. Nunyunnini was silent. Kalanu came out of the skull and waited with the rest of them. Gugwei put on the mammoth-hide cloak and put his head inside the skull. \"It is not a famine as you know it,\" said Nunyunnini, through Gugwei\u0027s mouth, \"although a famine will follow.\" \"Then what is it?\" asked Yanu. \"I am not afraid. I will stand against it. We have spears, and we have throwing rocks. Let a hundred mighty warriors come against us, still we shall prevail. We shall lead them into the marshes, and split their skulls with our flints.\" \"It is not a man thing,\" said Nunyunnini, in Gugwei\u0027s old voice. \"It will come from the skies, and none of your spears or your rocks will protect you.\" \"How can we protect ourselves?\" asked Atsula. \"I have seen flames in the skies. I have heard a noise louder than ten thunderbolts. I have seen forests flattened and rivers boil.\" \"Ai...,\" said Nunyunnini, but he said no more. Gugwei came out of the skull, bending stiffly, for he was an old man, and his knuckles were swollen and knotted. There was silence. Atsula threw more leaves on the fire, and the smoke made their eyes tear. Then Yanu strode to the mammoth head, put the cloak about his broad shoulders, put his head inside the skull. His voice boomed. \"You must journey,\" said Nunyunnini. \"You must travel to sunward. Where the sun rises, there you will find a new land, where you will be safe. It will be a long journey: the moon will swell and empty, die and live, twice, and there will be slavers and beasts, but I shall guide you and keep you safe, if you travel toward the sunrise.\" Atsula spat on the mud of the floor, and said, \"No.\" She could feel the god staring at her. \"No,\" she said. \"You are a bad god to tell us this. We will die. We will all die, and then who will be left to carry you from high place to high place, to raise your tent, to oil your great tusks with fat?\" The god said nothing. Atsula and Yanu exchanged places. Atsula\u0027s face stared out through the yellowed mammoth bone. \"Atsula has no faith,\" said Nunyunnini in Atsula\u0027s voice. \"Atsula shall die before the rest of you enter the new land, but the rest of you shall live. Trust me: there is a land to the east that is manless. This land shall be your land and the land of your children and your children\u0027s children, for seven generations, and seven sevens. But for Atsula\u0027s faithlessness, you would have kept it forever. In the morning, pack your tents and your possessions, and walk toward the sunrise.\" And Gugwei and Yanu and Kalanu bowed their heads and exclaimed at the power and wisdom of Nunyunnini. The moon swelled and waned and swelled and waned once more. The people of the tribe walked east, toward the sunrise, struggling through the icy winds, which numbed their exposed skin. Nunyunnini had promised them truly: they lost no one from the tribe on the journey, save for a woman in childbirth, and women in childbirth belong to the moon, not to Nunyunnini. They crossed the land bridge. Kalanu had left them at first light to scout the way. Now the sky was dark, and Kalanu had not returned, but the night sky was alive with lights, knotting and flickering and winding, flux and pulse, white and green and violet and red. Atsula and her people had seen the northern lights before, but they were still frightened by them, and this was a display like they had never seen before. Kalanu returned to them, as the lights in the sky formed and flowed. \"Sometimes,\" she said to Atsula, \"I feel that I could simply spread my arms and fall into the sky.\" \"That is because you are a scout,\" said Atsula, the priestess. \"When you die, you shall fall into the sky and become a star, to guide us as you guide us in life.\" \"There are cliffs of ice to the east, high cliffs,\" said Kalanu, her raven-black hair worn long, as a man would wear it. \"We can climb them, but it will take many days.\" \"You shall lead us safely,\" said Atsula. \"I shall die at the foot of the cliff, and that shall be the sacrifice that takes you into the new lands.\" To the west of them, back in the lands from which they had come, where the sun had set hours before, there was a flash of sickly yellow light, brighter than lightning, brighter than daylight. It was a burst of pure brilliance that forced the folk on the land bridge to cover their eyes and spit and exclaim. Children began to wail. \"That is the doom that Nunyunnini warned us of,\" said Gugwei the old. \"Surely he is a wise god and a mighty one.\" \"He is the best of all gods,\" said Kalanu. \"In our new land we shall raise him up on high, and we shall polish his tusks and skull with fish oil and animal fat, and we shall tell our children, and our children\u0027s children and our seventh children\u0027s children, that Nunyunnini is the mightiest of all gods, and shall never be forgotten.\" \"Gods are great,\" said Atsula, slowly, as if she were imparting a great secret. \"But the heart is greater. For it is from our hearts they come, and to our hearts they shall return...\" And there is no telling how long she might have continued in this blasphemy, had it not been interrupted in a manner that brooked no argument. The roar that erupted from the west was so loud that ears bled, that the people could hear nothing for some time, temporarily blinded and deafened but alive, knowing that they were luckier than the tribes to the west of them. \"It is good,\" said Atsula, but she could not hear the words inside her head. Atsula died at the foot of the cliffs when the spring sun was at its zenith. She did not live to see the New World, and the tribe walked into those lands with no holy woman. They scaled the cliffs, and they went south and west, until they found a valley with fresh water, and rivers that teemed with silver fish, and deer that had never seen man before and were so tame it was necessary to spit and to apologize to their spirits before killing them. Dalani gave birth to three boys, and some said that Kalanu had performed the final magic and could do the man-thing with her bride; while others said that old Gugwei was not too old to keep a young bride company when her husband was away; and certainly once Gugwei died, Dalani had no more children. And the ice times came and the ice times went, and the people spread out across the land, and formed new tribes and chose new totems: ravens and foxes and ground sloths and great cats and buffalo, each a beast that marked a tribe\u0027s identity, each beast a god. The mammoths of the new lands were bigger, and slower, and more foolish than the mammoth of the Siberian plains, and the pungh mushrooms, with their seven spots, were not to be found in the new lands, and Nunyunnini did not speak to the tribe any longer. And in the days of the grandchildren of Dalani and Kalanu\u0027s grandchildren, a band of warriors, members of a big and prosperous tribe, returning from a slaving expedition in the north to their home in the south, found the valley of the first people: they killed most of the men, and they took the women and many of the children captive. One of the children, hoping for clemency, took them to a cave in the hills in which they found a mammoth skull, the tattered remnants of a mammoth-skin cloak, a wooden cup, and the preserved head of Atsula the oracle. While some of the warriors of the new tribe were for taking the sacred objects away with them, stealing the gods of the first people and owning their power, others counseled against it, saying that they would bring nothing but ill luck and the malice of their own god (for these were the people of a raven tribe, and ravens are jealous gods). So they threw the objects down the side of the hill, into a deep ravine, and took the survivors of the first people with them on their long journey south. And the raven tribes, and the fox tribes, grew more powerful in the land, and soon Nunyunnini was entirely forgotten.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/375/970.html","bookId":309,"book":{"id":309,"title":"美国众神 American Gods","description":"简介： 《美国众神》描述主人公影子从监狱释放后，穿越美国大陆的旅行过程中的一系列奇遇。讲他与生活在美国土地上的各种神祇相遇，由此引发了出许多精彩动人、奇诡绚丽的故事。 影子...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110908/1-110ZQ42A0H3.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/375","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
