{"id":29885,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"-\"The Midnight Special,\" traditional\n Shadow and Wednesday ate breakfast at a Country Kitchen across the street from their motel. It was eight in the morning, and the world was misty and chill.\n \"You still ready to leave Eagle Point?\" asked Wednesday. \"I have some calls to make, if you are. Friday today. Friday\u0027s a free day. A woman\u0027s day. Saturday tomorrow. Much to do on Saturday.\"\n \"I\u0027m ready,\" said Shadow. \"Nothing keeping me here.\"\n Wednesday heaped his plate high with several kinds of breakfast meats. Shadow took some melon, a bagel, and a packet of cream cheese. They went and sat down in a booth.\n \"That was some dream you had last night,\" said Wednesday.\n \"Yes,\" said Shadow. \"It was.\" Laura\u0027s muddy footprints had been visible on the motel carpet when he got up that morning, leading from his bedroom to the lobby and out the door.\n \"So,\" said Wednesday. \"Why\u0027d they call you Shadow?\"\n Shadow shrugged. \"It\u0027s a name,\" he said. Outside the plate glass the world in the mist had become a pencil drawing executed in a dozen different grays with, here and there, a smudge of electric red or pure white. \"How\u0027d you lose your eye?\"\n Wednesday shoveled half a dozen pieces of bacon into his mouth, chewed, wiped the fat from his lips with the back of his hand. \"Didn\u0027t lose it,\" he said. \"I still know exactly where it is.\"\n \"So what\u0027s the plan?\"\n Wednesday looked thoughtful. He ate several vivid pink slices of ham, picked a fragment of meat from his beard, dropped it onto his plate. \"Plan is as follows. Tomorrow night we shall be meeting with a number of persons preeminent in their respective fields-do not let their demeanor intimidate you. We shall meet at one of the most important places in the entire country. Afterward we shall wine and dine them. I need to enlist them in my current enterprise.\"\n \"And where is this most important place?\"\n \"You\u0027ll see, m\u0027boy. I said one of them. Opinions are justifiably divided. I have sent word to my colleagues. We\u0027ll stop off in Chicago on the way, as I need to pick up some money. Entertaining, in the manner we shall need to entertain, will take more ready cash than I currently have available. Then on to Madison.\" Wednesday paid and they left, walked back across the road to the motel parking lot. Wednesday tossed Shadow the car keys.\n He drove down to the freeway and out of town.\n \"You going to miss it?\" asked Wednesday. He was sorting through a folder filled with maps.\n \"The town? No. I didn\u0027t really ever have a life here. I was never in one place too long as a kid, and I didn\u0027t get here until I was in my twenties. So this town is Laura\u0027s.\"\n \"Let\u0027s hope she stays here,\" said Wednesday.\n \"It was a dream,\" said Shadow. \"Remember.\"\n \"That\u0027s good,\" said Wednesday. \"Healthy attitude to have. Did you fuck her last night?\"\n Shadow took a breath. Then, \"That is none of your damn business. And no.\"\n \"Did you want to?\"\n Shadow said nothing at all. He drove north, toward Chicago. Wednesday chuckled, and began to pore over his maps, unfolding and refolding them, making occasional notes on a yellow legal pad with a large silver ballpoint pen.\n Eventually he was finished. He put his pen away, put the folder on the backseat. \"The best thing about the states we\u0027re heading for,\" said Wednesday, \"Minnesota, Wisconsin, all around there, is they have the kind of women I liked when I was younger. Pale-skinned and blue-eyed, hair so fair it\u0027s almost white, wine-colored lips, and round, full breasts with the veins running through them like a good cheese.\"\n \"Only when you were younger?\" asked Shadow. \"Looked like you were doing pretty good last night.\"\n \"Yes.\" Wednesday smiled. \"Would you like to know the secret of my success?\"\n \"You pay them?\"\n \"Nothing so crude. No, the secret is charm. Pure and simple.\"\n \"Charm, huh? Well, like they say, you either got it or you ain\u0027t.\"\n \"Charms can be learned,\" said Wednesday.\n Shadow tuned the radio to an oldies station, and listened to songs that were current before he was born. Bob Dylan sang about a hard rain that was going to fall, and Shadow wondered if that rain had fallen yet, or if it was something that was still going to happen. The road ahead of them was empty and the ice crystals on the asphalt glittered like diamonds in the morning sun.\n ***\n Chicago happened slowly, like a migraine. First they were driving through countryside, then, imperceptibly, the occasional town became a low suburban sprawl, and the sprawl became the city.\n They parked outside a squat black brownstone. The sidewalk was clear of snow. They walked to the lobby. Wednesday pressed the top button on the gouged metal intercom box. Nothing happened. He pressed it again. Then, experimentally, he began to press the other buttons, for other tenants, with no response.\n \"It\u0027s dead,\" said a gaunt old woman, coming down the steps. \"Doesn\u0027t work. We call the super, ask him when he going to fix, when he going to mend the heating, he does not care, goes to Arizona for the winter for his chest.\" Her accent was thick, Eastern European, Shadow guessed.\n Wednesday bowed low. \"Zorya, my dear, may I say how unutterably beautiful you look? A radiant creature. You have not aged.\"\n The old woman glared at him. \"He don\u0027t want to see you. I don\u0027t want to see you neither. You bad news.\"\n \"That\u0027s because I don\u0027t come if it isn\u0027t important.\"\n The woman sniffed. She carried an empty string shopping bag, and wore an old red coat, buttoned up to her chin. She looked at Shadow suspiciously.\n \"Who is the big man?\" she asked Wednesday. \"Another one of your murderers?\"\n \"You do me a deep disservice, good lady. This gentleman is called Shadow. He is working for me, yes, but on your behalf. Shadow, may I introduce you to the lovely Miss Zorya Vechernyaya.\"\n \"Good to meet you,\" said Shadow.\n Birdlike, the old woman peered up at him. \"Shadow,\" she said. \"A good name. When the shadows are long, that is my time. And you are the long shadow.\" She looked him up and down, then she smiled. \"You may kiss my hand,\" she said, and extended a cold hand to him.\n Shadow bent down and kissed her thin hand. She had a large amber ring on her middle finger.\n \"Good boy,\" she said. \"I am going to buy groceries. You see, I am the only one of us who brings in any money. The other two cannot make money fortune-telling. This is because they only tell the truth, and the truth is not what people want to hear. It is a bad thing, and it troubles people, so they do not come back. But I can lie to them, tell them what they want to hear. So I bring home the bread. Do you think you will be here for supper?\"\n \"I would hope so,\" said Wednesday.\n \"Then you had better give me some money to buy more food,\" she said. \"I am proud, but I am not stupid. The others are prouder than I am, and he is the proudest of all. So give me money and do not tell them that you give me money.\"\n Wednesday opened his wallet, and reached in. He took out a twenty. Zorya Vechernyaya plucked it from his fingers, and waited. He took out another twenty and gave it to her.\n \"Is good,\" she said. \"We will feed you like princes. Now, go up the stairs to the top. Zorya Utrennyaya is awake, but our other sister is still asleep, so do not be making too much noise.\"\n Shadow and Wednesday climbed the dark stairs. The landing two stories up was half filled with black plastic garbage bags and it smelled of rotting vegetables.\n \"Are they gypsies?\" asked Shadow.\n \"Zorya and her family? Not at all. They\u0027re not Rom. They\u0027re Russian. Slavs, I believe.\"\n \"But she does fortune-telling.\"\n \"Lots of people do fortune-telling. I dabble in it myself.\" Wednesday was panting as they went up the final flight of stairs. \"I\u0027m out of shape.\"\n The landing at the top of the stairs ended in a single door painted red, with a peephole in it.\n Wednesday knocked at the door. There was no response. He knocked again, louder this time.\n \"Okay! Okay! I heard you! I heard you!\" The sound of locks being undone, of bolts being pulled, the rattle of a chain. The red door opened a crack.\n \"Who is it?\" A man\u0027s voice, old and cigarette-roughened.\n \"An old friend, Czernobog. With an associate.\"\n The door opened as far as the security chain would allow. Shadow could see a gray face, in the shadows, peering out at them. \"What do you want, Votan?\"\n \"Initially, simply the pleasure of your company. And I have information to share. What\u0027s that phrase?...Oh yes. You may learn something to your advantage.\"\n The door opened all the way. The man in the dusty bathrobe was short, with iron-gray hair and craggy features. He wore gray pinstripe pants, shiny from age, and slippers. He held an unfiltered cigarette with square-tipped fingers, sucking the tip while keeping it cupped in his fist-like a convict, thought Shadow, or a soldier. He extended his left hand to Wednesday. \"Welcome then, Votan.\"\n \"They call me Wednesday these days,\" he said, shaking the old man\u0027s hand.\n A narrow smile; a flash of yellow teeth. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Very funny. And this is?\"\n \"This is my associate. Shadow, meet Mr. Czernobog.\"\n \"Well met,\" said Czernobog. He shook Shadow\u0027s left hand with his own. His hands were rough and callused, and the tips of his fingers were as yellow as if they had been dipped in iodine.\n \"How do you do, Mr. Czernobog?\"\n \"I do old. My guts ache, and my back hurts, and I cough my chest apart every morning.\"\n \"Why you are standing at the door?\" asked a woman\u0027s voice. Shadow looked over Czernobog\u0027s shoulder, at the old woman standing behind him. She was smaller and frailer than her sister, but her hair was long and still golden. \"I am Zorya Utrennyaya,\" she said. \"You must not stand there in the hall. You must go in, sit down. I will bring you coffee.\"\n Through the doorway into an apartment that smelted like overboiled cabbage and cat box and unfiltered foreign cigarettes, and they were ushered through a tiny hallway past several closed doors to the sitting room at the far end of the corridor, and were seated on a huge old horsehair sofa, disturbing an elderly gray cat in the process, who stretched, stood up, and walked, stiffly, to a distant part of the sofa, where he lay down, warily stared at each of them in turn, then closed one eye and went back to sleep. Czernobog sat in an armchair across from them.\n Zorya Utrennyaya found an empty ashtray and placed it beside Czernobog. \"How you want your coffee?\" she asked her guests. \"Here we take it black as night, sweet as sin.\"\n \"That\u0027ll be fine, ma\u0027am,\" said Shadow. He looked out of the window, at the buildings across the street.\n Zorya Utrennyaya went out. Czernobog stared at her as she left. \"That\u0027s a good woman,\" he said. \"Not like her sisters. One of them is a harpy, the other, all she does is sleep.\" He put his slippered feet up on a long, low coffee table, a chess board inset in the middle, cigarette burns and mug rings on its surface.\n \"Is she your wife?\" asked Shadow.\n \"She\u0027s nobody\u0027s wife.\" The old man sat in silence for a moment, looking down at his rough hands. \"No. We are all relatives. We come over here together, long time ago.\"\n From the pocket of his bathrobe, Czernobog produced a pack of unfiltered cigarettes. Wednesday pulled out a narrow gold lighter and lit the old man\u0027s cigarette. \"First we come to New York,\" said Czernobog. \"All our countrymen go to New York. Then, we come out here, to Chicago. Everything got very bad. Even in the old country, they had nearly forgotten me. Here, I am just a bad memory. You know what I did when I got to Chicago?\"\n \"No,\" said Shadow.\n \"I get a job in the meat business. On the kill floor. When the steer comes up the ramp, I was a knocker. You know why we are called knockers? Is because we take the sledgehammer and we knock the cow down with it. Bam! It takes strength in the arms. Yes? Then the shackler chains the beef up, hauls it up, then they cut the throat. They drain the blood first before they cut the head off. We were the strongest, the knockers.\" He pushed up the sleeve of his bathrobe, flexed his upper arm to display the muscles still visible under the old skin. \"Is not just strong though. There was an art to it. To the blow. Otherwise the cow is just stunned, or angry. Then, in the fifties, they give us the bolt gun. You put it to the forehead, bam! bam! Now you think, anybody can kill. Not so.\" He mimed putting a metal bolt through a cow\u0027s head. \"It still takes skill.\" He smiled at the memory, displaying an iron-colored tooth.\n \"Don\u0027t tell them cow-killing stories.\" Zorya Utrennyaya carried in their coffee on a red wooden tray, in small brightly enameled cups. She gave them each a cup, then sat beside Czernobog.\n \"Zorya Vechernyaya is doing shopping,\" she said. \"She will be soon back.\"\n \"We met her downstairs,\" said Shadow. \"She says she tells fortunes.\"\n \"Yes,\" said her sister. \"In the twilight, that is the time for lies. I do not tell good lies, so I am a poor fortune-teller. And our sister, Zorya Polunochnaya, she can\u0027t tell no lies at all.\"\n The coffee was even sweeter and stronger than Shadow had expected.\n Shadow excused himself to use the bathroom-a closet-like room, hung with several brown-spotted framed photographs of men and women in stiff Victorian poses. It was early afternoon, but already the daylight was beginning to fade. He heard voices raised from down the hall. He washed his hands in icy-cold water with a sickly-smelling sliver of pink soap.\n Czernobog was standing in the hall as Shadow came out.\n \"You bring trouble!\" he was shouting. \"Nothing but trouble! I will not listen! You will get out of my house!\"\n Wednesday was still sitting on the sofa, sipping his coffee, stroking the gray cat. Zorya Utrennyaya stood on the thin carpet, one hand nervously twining in and out of her long yellow hair.\n \"Is there a problem?\" asked Shadow.\n \"He is the problem!\" shouted Czernobog. \"He is! You tell him that there is nothing will make me help him! I want him to go! I want him out of here! Both of you go!\"\n \"Please,\" said Zorya Utrennyaya. \"Please be quiet, you wake up Zorya Polunochnaya.\"\n \"You are like him, you want me to join his madness!\" shouted Czernobog. He looked as if he was on the verge of tears. A pillar of ash tumbled from his cigarette onto the threadbare hall carpet.\n Wednesday stood up, walked over to Czernobog. He rested his hand on Czernobog\u0027s shoulder. \"Listen,\" he said, peaceably. \"Firstly, it\u0027s not madness. It\u0027s the only way. Secondly, everyone will be there. You would not want to be left out, would you?\"\n \"You know who I am,\" said Czernobog. \"You know what these hands have done. You want my brother, not me. And he\u0027s gone.\"\n A door in the hallway opened, and a sleepy female voice said, \"Is something wrong?\"\n \"Nothing is wrong, my sister,\" said Zorya Utrennyaya. \"Go back to sleep.\" Then she turned to Czernobog. \"See? See what you do with all your shouting? You go back in there and sit down. Sit!\" Czernobog looked as if he were about to protest; and then the fight went out of him. He looked frail, suddenly: frail, and lonely.\n The three men went back into the shabby sitting room. There was a brown nicotine ring around that room that ended about a foot from the ceiling, like the tide line in an old bathtub.\n \"It doesn\u0027t have to be for you,\" said Wednesday to Czernobog, unfazed. \"If it is for your brother, it\u0027s for you as well. That\u0027s one place you dualistic types have it over the rest of us, eh?\"\n Czernobog said nothing.\n \"Speaking of Bielebog, have you heard anything from him?\"\n Czernobog shook his head. He looked up at Shadow. \"Do you have a brother?\"\n \"No,\" said Shadow. \"Not that I know of.\"\n \"I have a brother. They say, you put us together, we are like one person, you know? When we are young, his hair, it is very blond, very light, his eyes are blue, and people say, he is the good one. And my hair it is very dark, darker than yours even, and people say I am the rogue, you know? I am the bad one. And now time passes, and my hair is gray. His hair, too, I think, is gray. And you look at us, you would not know who was light, who was dark.\"\n \"Were you close?\" asked Shadow.\n \"Close?\" asked Czernobog. \"No. How could we be? We cared about such different things.\"\n There was a clatter from the end of the hall, and Zorya Vechemyaya came in. \"Supper in one hour,\" she said. Then she went out.\n Czernobog sighed. \"She thinks she is a good cook,\" he said. \"She was brought up, there were servants to cook. Now, there are no servants. There is nothing.\"\n \"Not nothing,\" said Wednesday. \"Never nothing.\"\n \"You,\" said Czernobog. \"I shall not listen to you.\" He turned to Shadow. \"Do you play checkers?\" he asked.\n \"Yes,\" said Shadow.\n \"Good. You shall play checkers with me,\" he said, taking a wooden box of pieces from the mantelpiece and shaking them out onto the table. \"I shall play black.\"\n Wednesday touched Shadow\u0027s arm. \"You don\u0027t have to do this, you know,\" he said.\n \"Not a problem. I want to,\" said Shadow. Wednesday shrugged, and picked up an old copy of Reader\u0027s Digest from a small pile of yellowing magazines on the windowsill.\n Czernobog\u0027s brown fingers finished arranging the pieces on the squares, and the game began.\n ***\n In the days that were to come, Shadow often found himself remembering that game. Some nights he dreamed of it. His flat, round pieces were the color of old, dirty wood, nominally white. Czernobog\u0027s were a dull, faded black. Shadow was the first to move. In his dreams, there was no conversation as they played, just the loud click as the pieces were put down, or the hiss of wood against wood as they were slid from square to adjoining square.\n For the first half dozen moves each of the men slipped pieces out onto the board, into the center, leaving the back rows untouched. There were pauses between the moves, long, chesslike pauses, while each man watched, and thought.\n Shadow had played checkers in prison: it passed the time. He had played chess, too, but he was not temperamentally suited to planning ahead. He preferred picking the perfect move for the moment. You could win in checkers like that, sometimes.\n There was a click as Czernobog picked up a black piece and jumped it over one of Shadow\u0027s white pieces. The old man picked up Shadow\u0027s white piece and put it on the table at the side of the board.\n \"First blood. You have lost,\" said Czernobog. \"The game is done.\"\n \"No,\" said Shadow. \"Game\u0027s got a long way to go yet.\"\n \"Then would you care for a wager? A little side bet, to make it more interesting?\"\n \"No,\" said Wednesday, without looking up from a \"Humor in Uniform\" column. \"He wouldn\u0027t.\"\n \"I am not playing with you, old man. I play with him. So, you want to bet on the game, Mister Shadow?\"\n \"What were you two arguing about, before?\" asked Shadow.\n Czernobog raised a craggy eyebrow. \"Your master wants me to come with him. To help him with his nonsense. I would rather die.\"\n \"You want to bet? Okay. If I win, you come with us.\"\n The old man pursed his lips. \"Perhaps,\" he said. \"But only if you take my forfeit, when you lose.\"\n \"And that would be?\"\n There was no change in Czernobog\u0027s expression. \"If I win, I get to knock your brains out. With the sledgehammer. First you go down on your knees. Then I hit you a blow with it, so you don\u0027t get up again.\" Shadow looked at the man\u0027s old face, trying to read him. He was not joking, Shadow was certain of that: there was a hunger there for something, for pain, or death, or retribution.\n Wednesday closed the Reader\u0027s Digest. \"This is ridiculous,\" he said. \"I was wrong to come here. Shadow, we\u0027re leaving.\" The gray cat, disturbed, got to its feet and stepped onto the table beside the checkers game. If stared at the pieces, then leapt down onto the floor and, tail held high, it stalked from the room.\n \"No,\" said Shadow. He was not scared of dying. After all, it was not as if he had anything to live for. \u0027It\u0027s fine. I accept. If you win the game, you get the chance to knock my brains out with one blow of your sledgehammer,\" and he moved his next white piece to the adjoining square on the edge of the board.\n Nothing more was said, but Wednesday did not pick up his Reader\u0027s Digest again. He watched the game with his glass eye and his true eye, with an expression that betrayed nothing.\n Czernobog took another of Shadow\u0027s pieces. Shadow took two of Czernobog\u0027s. From the corridor came the smell of unfamiliar foods cooking. While not all of the smells were appetizing, Shadow realized suddenly how hungry he was.\n The two men moved their pieces, black and white, turn and turnabout. A flurry of pieces taken, a blossoming of two-piece-high kings: no longer forced to move only forward on the board, a sideways slip at a time, the kings could move forward or back, which made them doubly dangerous. They had reached the farthest row, and could go where they wanted. Czernobog had three kings, Shadow had two.\n Czernobog moved one of his kings around the board, eliminating Shadow\u0027s remaining pieces, while using the other two kings to keep Shadow\u0027s kings pinned down.\n And then Czernobog made a fourth king, and returned down the board to Shadow\u0027s two kings, and, unsmiling, took them both. And that was that.\n \"So,\" said Czernobog. \"I get to knock out your brains. And you will go on your knees willingly. Is good.\" He reached out an old hand, and patted Shadow\u0027s arm with it.\n \"We\u0027ve still got time before dinner\u0027s ready,\" said Shadow. \"You want another game? Same terms?\"\n Czernobog lit another cigarette, from a kitchen box of matches. \"How can it be same terms? You want I should kill you twice?\"\n \"Right now, you have one blow, that\u0027s all. You told me yourself that it\u0027s not just strength, it\u0027s skill too. This way, if you win this game, you get two blows to my head.\"\n Czernobog glowered. \"One blow is all it takes, one blow. That is the art.\" He patted his upper right arm, where the muscles were, with his left, scattering gray ash from the cigarette in his left hand.\n \"It\u0027s been a long time. If you\u0027ve lost your skill you might simply bruise me. How long has it been since you swung a killing hammer in the stockyards? Thirty years? Forty?\"\n Czernobog said nothing. His closed mouth was a gray slash across his face. He tapped his fingers on the wooden table, drumming out a rhythm with them. Then he pushed the twenty-four checkers back to their home squares on the board.\n \"Play,\" he said. \"Again, you are light. I am dark.\"\n Shadow pushed his first piece out. Czernobog pushed one of his own pieces forward. And it occurred to Shadow that Czernobog was going to try to play the same game again, the one that he had just won, that this would be his limitation.\n This time Shadow played recklessly. He snatched tiny opportunities, moved without thinking, without a pause to consider. And this time, as he played, Shadow smiled; and whenever Czernobog moved a piece, Shadow smiled wider.\n Soon, Czernobog was slamming his pieces down as he moved them, banging them down on the wooden table so hard that the remaining pieces shivered on their black squares.\n \"There,\" said Czernobog, taking one of Shadow\u0027s men with a crash, slamming the black piece down. \"There. What do you say to that?\"\n Shadow said nothing: he simply smiled, and jumped the piece that Czernobog had put down, and another, and another, and a fourth, clearing the center of the board of black pieces. He took a white piece from the pile beside the board and kinged his man.\n After that, it was just a mopping-up exercise: another handful of moves, and the game was done.\n Shadow said, \"Best of three?\"\n Czernobog simply stared at him, his gray eyes like points of steel. And then he laughed, clapped his hands on Shadow\u0027s shoulders. \"I like you!\" he exclaimed. \"You have balls.\"\n Then Zorya Utrennyaya put her head around the door to tell them that dinner was ready, and they should clear their game away and put the tablecloth down on the table.\n \"We have no dining room,\" she said, \"I am sorry. We eat in here.\"\n Serving dishes were placed on the table. Each of the diners was given a small painted tray on which was some tarnished cutlery, to hold on his or her lap.\n Zorya Vechernyaya took five wooden bowls and placed an unpeeled boiled potato in each, then ladled in a healthy serving of a ferociously crimson borscht. She plopped a spoonful of white sour cream in, and handed the bowls to each of them.\n \"I thought there were six of us,\" said Shadow.\n \"Zorya Polunochnaya is still asleep,\" said Zorya Vechernyaya. \"We keep her food in the refrigerator. When she wakes, she will eat.\"\n The borscht was vinegary, and tasted like pickled beets. The boiled potato was mealy.\n The next course was a leathery pot roast, accompanied by greens of some description-although they had been boiled so long and so thoroughly that they were no longer, by any stretch of the imagination, greens, and were well on their way to becoming browns.\n Then there were cabbage leaves stuffed with ground meat and rice, cabbage leaves of such a toughness that they were almost impossible to cut without spattering ground meat and rice all over the carpet. Shadow pushed his around his plate.\n \"We played checkers,\" said Czernobog, hacking himself another lump of pot roast. \"The young man and me. He won a game, I won a game. Because he won a game, I have agreed to go with him and Wednesday, and help them in their madness. And because I won a game, when this is all done, I get to kill the young man, with a blow of a hammer.\"\n The two Zoryas nodded gravely. \"Such a pity,\" Zorya Vechernyaya told Shadow. \"In my fortune for you, I should have said you would have a long life and a happy one, with many children.\"\n \"That is why you are a good fortune-teller,\" said Zorya Utrennyaya. She looked sleepy, as if it were an effort for her to be up so late. \"You tell the best lies.\"\n At the end of the meal, Shadow was still hungry. Prison food had been pretty bad, and prison food was better than this.\n \"Good food,\" said Wednesday, who had cleaned his plate with every evidence of enjoyment. \"I thank you ladies. And now, I am afraid that it is incumbent upon us to ask you to recommend to us a fine hotel in the neighborhood.\"\n Zorya Vechernyaya looked offended at this. \"Why should you go to a hotel?\" she said. \"We are not your friends?\"\n \"I couldn\u0027t put you to any trouble...\" said Wednesday.\n \"Is no trouble,\" said Zorya Utrennyaya, one hand playing with her incongruously golden hair, and she yawned.\n \"You can sleep in Bielebog\u0027s room,\" said Zorya Vechernyaya, pointing to Wednesday. \"Is empty. And for you, young man, I make up a bed on sofa. You will be more comfortable than in feather bed. I swear.\"\n \"That would be really kind of you,\" said Wednesday. \"We accept.\"\n \"And you pay me only no more than what you pay for hotel,\" said Zorya Vechernyaya, with a triumphant toss of her head. \"A hundred dollars.\"\n \"Thirty\" said Wednesday.\n \"Fifty.\"\n \"Thirty-five.\"\n \"Forty-five.\"\n \"Forty.\"\n \"Is good. Forty-five dollar.\" Zorya Vechernyaya reached across the table and shook Wednesday\u0027s hand. Then she began to clean the pots off the table. Zorya Utrennyaya yawned so hugely Shadow worried that she might dislocate her jaw, and announced that she was going to bed before she fell asleep with her head in the pie, and she said good night to them all.\n Shadow helped Zorya Vechernyaya to take the plates and dishes into the little kitchen. To his surprise there was an elderly dishwashing machine beneath the sink, and he filled it. Zorya Vechernyaya looked over his shoulder, tutted, and removed the wooden borscht bowls. \"Those, in the sink,\" she told him.\n \"Sorry.\"\n \"Is not to worry. Now, back in there, we have pie,\" she said.\n The pie-it was an apple pie-had been bought in a store and oven-warmed, and was very, very good. The four of them ate it with ice cream, and then Zorya Vechernyaya made everyone go out of the sitting room, and made up a very fine-looking bed on the sofa for Shadow.\n Wednesday spoke to Shadow as they stood in the corridor.\n \"What you did in there, with the checkers game,\" he said.\n \"Yes?\"\n \"That was good. Very, very stupid of you. But good. Sleep safe.\"\n Shadow brushed his teeth and washed his face in the cold water of the little bathroom, and then walked back down the hall to the sitting room, turned out the light, and was asleep before his head touched the pillow.\n ***\n There were explosions in Shadow\u0027s dream: he was driving a truck through a minefield, and bombs were going off on each side of him. The windshield shattered and he felt warm blood running down his face.\n Someone was shooting at him.\n A bullet punctured his lung, a bullet shattered his spine, another hit his shoulder. He felt each bullet strike. He collapsed across the steering wheel.\n The last explosion ended in darkness.\n I must be dreaming, thought Shadow, alone in the darkness. I think I just died. He remembered hearing and believing, as a child, that if you died in your dreams, you would die in real life. He did not feel dead. He opened his eyes, experimentally.\n There was a woman in the little sitting room, standing against the window, with her back to him. His heart missed a half-beat, and he said, \"Laura?\"\n She turned, framed by the moonlight. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \"I did not mean to wake you.\" She had a soft, Eastern European accent. \"I will go.\"\n \"No, it\u0027s okay,\" said Shadow. \"You didn\u0027t wake me. I had a dream.\"\n \"Yes,\" she said. \"You were crying out, and moaning. Part of me wanted to wake you, but I thought, no, I should leave him.\"\n Her hair was pale and colorless in the moon\u0027s thin light. She wore a white cotton nightgown, with a high lace neck and a hem that swept the ground. Shadow sat up, entirely awake. \"You are Zorya Polu...,\" he hesitated. \"The sister who was asleep.\"\n \"I am Zorya Polunochnaya, yes. And-you are called Shadow, yes? That was what Zorya Vechernyaya told me, when I woke.\"\n \"Yes. What were you looking at, out there?\"\n She looked at him, then she beckoned him to join her by the window. She turned her back while he pulled on his jeans. He walked over to her. It seemed a long walk, for such a small room.\n He could not tell her age. Her skin was unlined, her eyes were dark, her lashes were long, her hair was to her waist and white. The moonlight drained colors into ghosts of themselves. She was taller than either of her sisters.\n She pointed up into the night sky. \"I was looking at that,\" she said, pointing to the Big Dipper. \"See?\"\n \"Ursa Major,\" he said. \"The Great Bear.\"\n \"That is one way of looking at it,\" she said. \"But it is not the way from where I come from. I am going to sit on the roof. Would you like to come with me?\"\n She lifted the window and clambered, barefoot, out onto the fire escape. A freezing wind blew through the window. Something was bothering Shadow, but he did not know what it was; he hesitated, then pulled on his sweater, stocks, and shoes and followed her out onto the rusting fire escape. She was waiting for him. His breath steamed in the chilly air. He watched her bare feet pad up the icy metal steps, and followed her up to the roof.\n The wind gusted cold, flattening her nightgown against her body, and Shadow became uncomfortably aware that Zorya Polunochnaya was wearing nothing at all underneath.\n \"You don\u0027t mind the cold?\" he said, as they reached the top of the fire escape, and the wind whipped his words away.\n \"Sorry?\"\n She bent her face close to his. Her breath was sweet.\n \"I said, doesn\u0027t the cold bother you?\"\n In reply, she held up a finger: wait. She stepped, lightly, over the side of the building and onto the flat roof. Shadow stepped over a little more clumsily, and followed her across the roof, to the shadow of the water tower. There was a wooden bench waiting for them there, and she sat down on it, and he sat down beside her. The water tower acted as a windbreak, for which Shadow was grateful.\n \"No,\" she said. \"The cold does not bother me. This time is my time: I could no more feel uncomfortable in the night than a fish could feel uncomfortable in the deep water.\"\n \"You must like the night,\" said Shadow, wishing that he had said something wiser, more profound.\n \"My sisters are of their times. Zorya Utrennyaya is of the dawn. In the old country she would wake to open the gates, and let our father drive his-uhm, I forget the word, like a car but with horses?\"\n \"Chariot?\u0027\n \"His chariot. Our father would ride it out. And Zorya Vechernyaya, she would open the gates for him at dusk, when he returned to us.\"\n \"And you?\"\n She paused. Her lips were full, but very pale, \"I never saw our father. I was asleep.\"\n \"Is it a medical condition?\"\n She did not answer. The shrug, if she shrugged, was imperceptible. \"So. You wanted to know what I was looking at.\"\n \"The Big Dipper.\"\n She raised an arm to point to it, and the wind flattened her nightgown against her body. Her nipples, every goose-bump on the areolae, were visible momentarily, dark against the white cotton. Shadow shivered.\n \"Odin\u0027s Wain, they call it. And the Great Bear. Where we come from, we believe that is a, a thing, a, not a god, but like a god, a bad thing, chained up in those stars. If it escapes, it will eat the whole of everything. And there are three sisters who must watch the sky, all the day, all the night. If he escapes, the thing in the stars, the world is over. Pf!, like that.\"\n \"And people believe that?\"\n \"They did. A long time ago.\"\n \"And you were looking to see if you could see the monster in the stars?\"\n \"Something like that. Yes.\"\n He smiled. If it were not for the cold, he decided, he would have thought he was dreaming. Everything felt so much like a dream.\n \"Can I ask how old you are? Your sisters seem so much older.\"\n She nodded her head. \"I am the youngest. Zorya Utrennyaya was born in the morning, and Zorya Vechernyaya was born in the evening, and I was born at midnight. I am the midnight sister: Zorya Polunochnaya. Are you married?\"\n \"My wife is dead. She died last week in a car accident. It was her funeral yesterday.\"\n \"I\u0027m so sorry.\"\n \"She came to see me last night.\" It was not hard to say, in the darkness and the moonlight; it was not as unthinkable as it was by daylight.\n \"Did you ask her what she wanted?\"\n \"No. Not really.\"\n \"Perhaps you should. It is the wisest thing to ask the dead. Sometimes they will tell you. Zorya Vechernyaya tells me that you played checkers with Czernobog.\"\n \"Yes. He won the right to knock in my skull with a sledge.\"\n \"In the old days, they would take people up to the top of the mountains. To the high places. They would smash the back of their skulls with a rock. For Czernobog.\"\n Shadow glanced about. No, they were alone on the roof.\n Zorya Polunochnaya laughed. \"Silly, he is not here. And you won a game also. He may not strike his blow until this is all over. He said he would not. And you will know. Like the cows he killed. They always know, first. Otherwise, what is the point?\"\n \"I feel,\" Shadow told her, \"like I\u0027m in a world with its own sense of logic. Its own rules. Like when you\u0027re in a dream, and you know there are rules you mustn\u0027t break. Even if you don\u0027t know what they mean. I\u0027m just going along with it, you know?\"\n \"I know,\" she said. She held his hand, with a hand that was icy cold. \"You were given protection once. You were given the sun itself. But you lost it already. You gave it away. All I can give you is much weaker protection. The daughter, not the father. But all helps. Yes?\" Her white hair blew about her face in the chilly wind.\n \"Do I have to fight you? Or play checkers?\" he asked.\n \"You do not even have to kiss me,\" she told him. \"Just take the moon from me.\"\n \"How?\"\n \"Take the moon.\"\n \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\n \"Watch,\" said Zorya Polunochnaya. She raised her left hand and held it in front of the moon, so that her forefinger and thumb seemed to be grasping it. Then, in one smooth movement, she plucked at it. For a moment, it looked like she had taken the moon from the sky, but then Shadow saw that the moon shone still, and Zorya Polunochnaya opened her hand to display a silver Liberty-head dollar resting between finger and thumb.\n \"That was beautifully done,\" said Shadow. \"I didn\u0027t see you palm it. And I don\u0027t know how you did that last bit.\"\n \"I did not palm it,\" she said. \"I took it. And now I give it to you, to keep safe. Here. Don\u0027t give this one away.\"\n She placed it in his right hand and closed his fingers around it. The coin was cold in his hand. Zorya Polunochnaya leaned forward, and closed his eyes with her fingers, and kissed him, lightly, once upon each eyelid.\n ***\n Shadow awoke on the sofa, fully dressed. A narrow shaft of sunlight streamed in through the window, making the dust motes dance.\n He got out of bed, and walked over to the window. The room seemed much smaller in the daylight.\n The thing that had been troubling him since last night came into focus as he looked out and down and across the street. There was no fire escape outside this window: no balcony, no rusting metal steps.\n Still, held tight in the palm of his hand, bright and shiny as the day it had been minted, was a 1922 Liberty-head silver dollar.\n \"Oh. You\u0027re up,\" said Wednesday, putting his head around the door. \"That\u0027s good. You want coffee? We\u0027re going to rob a bank.\"\n ***\n The important thing to understand about American history, wrote Mr. Ibis, in his leather-bound journal, is that it is fictional, a charcoal-sketched simplicity for the children, or the easily bored. For the most part it is uninspected, unimagined, unthought, a representation of the thing, and not the thing itself. It is a fine fiction, he continued, pausing for a moment to dip his pen in the inkwell and collect his thoughts, that America was founded by pilgrims, seeking the freedom to believe as they wished, that they came to the Americas, spread and bred and filled the empty land.\n In truth, the American colonies were as much a dumping ground as an escape, a forgetting place. In the days where you could be hanged in London from Tyburn\u0027s triple-crowned tree for the theft of twelve pennies, the Americas became a symbol of clemency, of a second chance. But the conditions of transportation were such that, for some, it was easier to take the leap from the leafless and dance on nothing until the dancing was done. Transportation, it was called: for five years, for ten years, for life. That was the sentence.\n You were sold to a captain, and would ride in his ship, crowded tight as a slaver\u0027s, to the colonies or to the West Indies; off the boat the captain would sell you on as an indentured servant to one who would take the cost of your skin out in your labor until the years of your indenture were done. But at least you were not waiting to hang in an English prison (for in those days prisons were places where you stayed until you were freed, transported, or hanged: you were not sentenced there for a term), and you were free to make the best of your new world. You were also free to bribe a sea captain to return you to England before the terms of your transportation were over and done. People did. And if the authorities caught you returning from transportation-if an old enemy, or an old friend with a score to settle, saw you and peached on you-then you were hanged without a blink.\n I am reminded, he continued, after a short pause, during which he refilled the inkwell on his desk from the bottle of umber ink from the closet and dipped his pen once more, of the life of Essie Tregowan, who came from a chilly little cliff-top village in Cornwall, in the southwest of England, where her family had lived from time out of mind. Her father was a fisherman, and it was rumored that he was one of the wreckers-those who would hang their lamps high on the dangerous cliffs when the storm winds raged, luring ships onto the rocks, for the goods on shipboard. Essie\u0027s mother was in service as a cook at the squire\u0027s house, and at the age of twelve Essie began to work there, in the scullery. She was a thin little thing, with wide brown eyes and dark brown hair; and she was not a hard worker but was forever slipping off and away to listen to stories and tales, if there was anyone who would tell them: tales of the piskies and the spriggans, of the black dogs of the moors and the seal-women of the Channel. And, though the squire laughed at such things, the kitchen-folk always put out a china saucer of the creamiest milk at night, put it outside the kitchen door, for the piskies.\n Several years passed, and Essie was no longer a thin little thing: now she curved and billowed like the swell of the green sea, and her brown eyes laughed, and her chestnut hair tossed and curled. Essie\u0027s eyes lighted on Bartholomew, the squire\u0027s eighteen-year-old son, home from Rugby, and she went at night to the standing stone on the edge of the woodland, and she put some bread that Bartholomew had been eating but had left unfinished on the stone, wrapped in a cut strand of her own hair. And on the very next day Bartholomew came and talked to her, and looked on her approvingly with his own eyes, the dangerous blue of a sky when a storm is coming, while she was cleaning out the grate in his bedroom. He had such dangerous eyes, said Essie Tregowan.\n Soon enough Bartholomew went up to Oxford, and, when Essie\u0027s condition became apparent, she was dismissed. But the babe was stillborn, and as a favor to Essie\u0027s mother, who was a very fine cook, the squire\u0027s wife prevailed upon her husband to return the former maiden to her former position in the scullery.\n But Essie\u0027s love for Bartholomew had turned to hatred for his family, and within the year she took for her new beau a man from a neighboring village, with a bad reputation, who went by the name of Josiah Horner. And one night, when the family slept, Essie arose in the night and unbolted the side door, to let her lover in. He rifled the house while the family slept on.\n Suspicion immediately fell upon someone in the house, for it was apparent that someone must have opened the door (which the squire\u0027s wife distinctly remembered having bolted herself), and someone must have known where the squire kept his silver plate, and the drawer in which he kept his coins and his promissory notes. Still, Essie, by resolutely denying everything, was convicted of nothing until Master Josiah Horner was caught, in a chandler\u0027s in Exeter, passing one of the squire\u0027s notes. The squire identified it as his, and Horner and Essie went to trial.\n Horner was convicted at the local assizes, and was, as the slang of the time so cruelly and so casually had it, turned off, but the judge took pity on Essie, because of her age or her chestnut hair, and he sentenced her to seven years\u0027 transportation. She was to be transported on a ship called the Neptune, under the command of one Captain Clarke. So Essie went to the Carolinas; and on the way she conceived an alliance with the selfsame captain, and prevailed upon him to return her to England with him, as his wife, and to take her to his mother\u0027s house in London, where no man knew her. The journey back, when the human cargo had been exchanged for cotton and tobacco, was a peaceful time and a happy one for the captain and his new bride, who were as two lovebirds or courting butterflies, unable to cease from touching each other or giving each other little gifts and endearments.\n When they reached London, Captain Clarke lodged Essie with his mother, who treated her in all ways as her son\u0027s new wife. Eight weeks later, the Neptune set sail again, and the pretty young bride with the chestnut hair waved her husband goodbye from dockside. Then she returned to her mother-in-law\u0027s house, where, the old woman being absent, Essie helped herself to a length of silk, several gold coins, and a silver pot in which the old woman kept her buttons, and pocketing these things Essie vanished into the stews of London.\n Over the following two years Essie became an accomplished shoplifter, her wide skirts capable of concealing a multitude of sins, consisting chiefly of stolen bolts of silk and lace, and she lived life to the full. Essie gave thanks for her escapes from her vicissitudes to all the creatures that she had been told of as a child, to the piskies (whose influence, she was certain, extended as far as London), and she would put a wooden bowl of milk on a window ledge each night, although her friends laughed at her; but she had the last laugh, as her friends got the pox or the clap and Essie remained in the peak of health.\n She was a year shy of her twentieth birthday when fate dealt her an ill blow: she sat in the Crossed Forks Inn off Fleet Street, in Bell Yard, when she saw a young man enter and seat himself near the fireplace, fresh down from the university. Oho! A pigeon ripe for the plucking, thinks Essie to herself, and she sits next to him, and tells him what a fine young man he is, and with one hand she begins to stroke his knee, while her other hand, more carefully, goes in search of his pocket watch. And then he looked her full in the face, and her heart leapt and sank as eyes the dangerous blue of the summer sky before a storm gazed back into hers, and Master Bartholomew said her name.\n She was taken to Newgate and charged with returning from transportation. Found guilty, Essie shocked no one by pleading her belly, although the town matrons, who assessed such claims (which were usually spurious) were surprised when they were forced to agree that Essie was indeed with child; although who the father was, Essie declined to say.\n Her sentence of death was once more commuted to transportation, this time for life.\n She rode out this time on the Sea-Maiden. There were two hundred transportees on that ship, packed into the hold like so many fat hogs on their way to market. Fluxes and fevers ran rampant; there was scarcely room to sit, let alone to lie down; a woman died in childbirth in the back of the hold, and, the people being pushed in too tightly to pass her body forward, she and the infant were forced out of a small porthole in the back, directly into the choppy gray sea. Essie was eight months gone, and it was a wonder she kept the baby, but keep it she did.\n In her life ever after she would have nightmares of her time in that hold, and she would wake up screaming with the taste and stench of the place in her throat.\n The Sea-Maiden landed at Norfolk in Virginia, and Essie\u0027s indenture was bought by a \"small planter,\" a tobacco farmer named John Richardson, for his wife had died of the childbirth fever a week after giving birth to his daughter, and he had need of a wet nurse and a maid of all work upon his smallholding.\n So Essie\u0027s baby boy, whom she called Anthony, after, she said, her late husband his father (knowing there was none there to contradict her, and perhaps she had known an Anthony once), sucked at Essie\u0027s breast alongside of Phyllida Richardson, and her employer\u0027s child always got first suck, so she grew into a healthy child, tall and strong, while Essie\u0027s son grew weak and rickety on what was left.\n And along with the milk, the children as they grew drank Essie\u0027s tales: of the knockers and the blue-caps who live down the mines; of the Bucca, the trickiest spirit of the land, much more dangerous than the redheaded, snub-nosed piskies, for whom the first fish of the catch was always left upon the shingle, and for whom a fresh-baked loaf of bread was left in the field, at reaping time, to ensure a fine harvest; she told them of the apple-tree men-old apple trees who talked when they had a mind, and who needed to be placated with the first cider of the crop, which was poured onto their roots as the year turned, if they were to give you a fine crop for the next year. She told them, in her mellifluous Cornish drawl, which trees they should be wary of, in the old rhyme:\n She told them all these things, and they believed, because she believed.\n The farm prospered, and Essie Tregowan placed a china saucer of milk outside the back door, each night, for the piskies. And after eight months John Richardson came a-knocking quietly on Essie\u0027s bedroom door, and asked her for favors of the kind a woman shows a man, and Essie told him how shocked and hurt she was, a poor widow woman, and an indentured servant no better than a slave, to be asked to prostitute herself for a man whom she had had so much respect for-and an indentured servant could not marry, so how he could even think to torment an indentured transportee girl so she could not bring herself to think-and her nut-brown eyes filled with tears, such that Richardson found himself apologizing to her, and the upshot of it was that John Richardson wound up, in that corridor, of that hot summer\u0027s night, going down on one knee to Essie Tregowan and proposing an end to her indenture and offering his hand in marriage. Now, although she accepted him, she would not sleep a night with him until it was legal, whereupon she moved from the little room in the attic to the master bedroom in the front of the house; and if some of Farmer Richardson\u0027s friends and their wives cut him when next they saw him in town, many more of them were of the opinion that the new Mistress Richardson was a damn fine-looking woman, and that Johnnie Richardson had done quite well for himself.\n Within a year, she was delivered of another child, another boy, but as blond as his father and his half sister, and they named him John, after his father.\n The three children went to the local church to hear the traveling preacher on Sundays, and they went to the little school to learn their letters and their numbers with the children of the other small fanners; while Essie also made sure they knew the mysteries of the piskies, which were the most important mysteries there were: redheaded men, with eyes and clothes as green as a river and turned-up noses, funny, squinting men who would, if they got a mind to, turn you and twist you and lead you out of your way, unless you had salt in your pocket, or a little bread. When the children went off to school, they each of them carried a little salt in one pocket, a little bread in the other, the old symbols of life and the earth, to make sure they came safely home once more, and they always did.\n The children grew in the lush Virginia hills, grew tall and strong (although Anthony, her first son, was always weaker, paler, more prone to disease and bad airs) and the Richardsons were happy; and Essie loved her husband as best she could. They had been married a decade when John Richardson developed a toothache so bad it made him fall from his horse. They took him to the nearest town, where his tooth was pulled; but it was too late, and the blood poisoning carried him off, black-faced and groaning, and they buried him beneath his favorite willow tree.\n The widow Richardson was left the farm to manage until Richardson\u0027s two children were of age: she managed the indentured servants and the slaves, and brought in the tobacco crop, year in, year out; she poured cider on the roots of the apple trees on New Year\u0027s Eve, and placed a loaf of new-baked bread in the fields at harvest time, and she always left a saucer of milk at the back door. The farm flourished, and the widow Richardson gained a reputation as a hard bargainer, but one whose crop was always good, and who never sold shoddy for better merchandise.\n So all went well for another ten years; but after that was a bad year, for Anthony, her son, slew Johnnie, his half brother, in a furious quarrel over the future of the farm and the disposition of Phyllida\u0027s hand; and some said he had not meant to kill his brother, and that it was a foolish blow that struck too deep, and some said otherwise. Anthony fled, leaving Essie to bury her youngest son beside his father. Now, some said Anthony fled to Boston, and some said he went south, and his mother was of the opinion that he had taken ship to England, to enlist in George\u0027s army and fight the rebel Scots. But with both sons gone the farm was an empty place, and a sad one, and Phyllida pined and plained as if her heart had been broken, while nothing that her stepmother could say or do would put a smile back on her lips again.\n But heartbroken or not, they needed a man about the farm, and so Phyllida married Harry Soames, a ship\u0027s carpenter by profession, who had tired of the sea and who dreamed of a life on land on a farm like the Lincolnshire farm upon which he had grown up. And although the Richardsons\u0027 farm was little enough like that, Harry Soames found correspondences enough to make him happy. Five children were born to Phyllida and Harry, three of whom lived.\n The widow Richardson missed her sons, and she missed her husband, although he was now little more than a memory of a fair man who treated her kindly. Phyllida\u0027s children would come to Essie for tales, and she would tell them of the Black Dog of the Moors, and of Raw-Head and Bloody-Bones, or the Apple Tree Man, but they were not interested; they only wanted tales of Jack-Jack up the Beanstalk, or Jack Giant-killer, or Jack and his Cat and the King. She loved those children as if they were her own flesh and blood, although sometimes she would call them by the names of those long dead.\n It was May, and she took her chair out into the kitchen garden to pick peas and to shuck them in the sunlight, for even in the lush heat of Virginia the cold had entered her bones as the frost had entered her hair, and a little warmth was a fine thing.\n As the widow Richardson shucked the peas with her old hands, she got to thinking about how fine it would be to walk once more on the moors and the salty cliffs of her native Cornwall, and she thought of sitting on the shingle as a little girl, waiting for her father\u0027s ship to return from the gray seas. Her hands, blue-knuckled and clumsy, opened the pea pods, forced the full peas into an earthenware bowl, and dropped the empty pea pods onto her aproned lap. And then she found herself remembering, as she had not remembered for a long time, a life well lost: how she had twitched purses and filched silks with her clever fingers; and now she remembers the warden of Newgate telling her that it will be a good twelve weeks before her case would be heard, and that she could escape the gallows if she could plead her belly, and what a pretty thing she was-and how she had turned to the wall and bravely lifted her skirts, hating herself and hating him, but knowing he was right; and the feel of the life quickening inside her that meant that she could cheat death for a little longer...\n \"Essie Tregowan?\" said the stranger.\n The widow Richardson looked up, shading her eyes in the May sunshine. \"Do I know you?\" she asked. She had not heard him approach.\n The man was dressed all in green: dusty green trews, green jacket, and a dark green coat. His hair was a carroty red, and he grinned at her all lopsided. There was something about the man that made her happy to look at him, and something else that whispered of danger. \"You might say that you know me,\" he said.\n He squinted down at her, and she squinted right back up at him, searching his moon-face for a clue to his identity. He looked as young as one of her own grandchildren, yet he had called her by her old name, and there was a burr in his voice she knew from her childhood, from the rocks and the moors of her home.\n \"You\u0027re a Cornishman?\" she asked.\n \"That I am, a Cousin Jack,\" said the red-haired man. \"Or rather, that I was, but now I\u0027m here in this new world, where nobody puts out ale or milk for an honest fellow, or a loaf of bread come harvest time.\"\n The old woman steadied the bowl of peas upon her lap. \"If you\u0027re who I think you are,\" she said, \"then I\u0027ve no quarrel with you.\" In the house, she could hear Phyllida grumbling to the housekeeper.\n \"Nor I with you,\" said the red-haired fellow, a little sadly, \"although it was you that brought me here, you and a few like you, into this land with no time for magic and no place for piskies and such folk.\"\n \"You\u0027ve done me many a good turn,\" she said.\n \"Good and ill,\" said the squinting stranger. \"We\u0027re like the wind. We blows both ways.\"\n Essie nodded.\n \"Will you take my hand, Essie Tregowan?\" And he reached out a hand to her. Freckled it was, and although Essie\u0027s eyesight was going she could see each orange hair on the back of his hand, glowing golden in the afternoon sunlight. She bit her lip. Then, hesitantly, she placed her blue-knotted hand in his.\n She was still warm when they found her, although the life had fled her body and only half the peas were shelled.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/375/961.html","bookId":309,"book":{"id":309,"title":"美国众神 American Gods","description":"简介： 《美国众神》描述主人公影子从监狱释放后，穿越美国大陆的旅行过程中的一系列奇遇。讲他与生活在美国土地上的各种神祇相遇，由此引发了出许多精彩动人、奇诡绚丽的故事。 影子...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/110908/1-110ZQ42A0H3.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/375","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
