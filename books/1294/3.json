{"id":13024,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"There were banquets and more banquets, and women of every size and shape. The city of New Calleth went all out to welcome the space travellers. Bobby Galus and Gary Dale. At the end of a week of festivity, the mayor came to Cal and Dave. \"Have you enjoyed your stay, boys?\" he asked. \"It was swell,\" Cal said, \"but you\u0027ve got things all....\" \"I was wondering when you planned on leaving for the capitol. Don\u0027t misunderstand me. We\u0027d like you to stay as long as you want to, but....\" \"For God\u0027s sake,\" Cal snapped, \"will you please listen to me?\" Mayor Panley was visibly shaken. \"Why, of course, Captain Galus. Of course. Why, certainly.\" He lapsed into silence. \"I\u0027m not Bobby Galus,\" Cal said. \"And this isn\u0027t Gary Dale.\" The mayor nodded his head. \"You\u0027re ... not ... Galus and Dale,\" he said slowly. \"That\u0027s right,\" Cal said. \"We didn\u0027t go to Earth. We came from there. This is the first time we\u0027ve ever been on Mars. Do you understand? We\u0027re Earthmen.\" \"Earthmen?\" The mayor considered this for a second and then burst out laughing. \"Why, that\u0027s preposterous. Absolutely preposterous!\" His laugh rose in volume to a bellow. \"Oh, you\u0027re joking. I should have known. You\u0027re only joking.\" \"We\u0027re not joking. This is all some kind of a horrible mistake. We\u0027re the first men to land on Mars. You\u0027ve got to understand that,\" Dave pleaded. The mayor was still laughing. He walked to the door and opened it. \"All right, boys, have your little joke. You\u0027ve earned the right to it. I\u0027ll make arrangements for you to leave for Dome City in the morning.\" He shook his head and chuckled again. \"Earthmen. Tch-tch.\" And then he was gone. They sat alone in the hotel room. It looked like any Earth hotel they\u0027d ever been in. A big soft bed. A wall telephone. Two dressers. Two armchairs. A big mirror over one of the dressers. A television set on the other dresser. \"This is screwy,\" Dave said. \"Is it possible we\u0027re back on Earth? Is it possible the joke is on us? Maybe everyone is just ribbing us. Maybe we\u0027ve been going around in circles for four years. Maybe....\" \"No,\" Cal said. \"We\u0027re on Mars all right. I don\u0027t know exactly how to explain it, but I\u0027ve got an idea.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" Dave asked. Cal shrugged. \"Probably all wrong, of course. But it has something to do with comparable development of cultures on different planets.\" \"You mean Mars is in exactly the same state of development as Earth?\" \"Something like that. You know the theory. Give two different places the same materials to start with, and their cultures will run parallel to each other for the rest of their existence.\" \"Sure,\" Dave said. \"But these guys Galus and Dale. How the hell could we possibly be mistaken for them?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" Cal leaned back on the bed and stared at the ceiling. \"Maybe we\u0027ll find out in Dome City.\" \"Maybe,\" Dave repeated hollowly. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2788/77202.html","bookId":1294,"book":{"id":1294,"title":"Welcome Martians","description":"简介： The only sound was the swish of the jets against the sand as the big ship came down.
