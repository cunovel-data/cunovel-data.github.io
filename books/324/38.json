{"id":16971,"no":38,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVIII THE AGENT IS NOTIFIED","content":"It was still early in the evening when Frank and Mr. Hamlin reached the house of the agent. Had they come five minutes later, they would have found him absent. Usually, soon after supper, he made his way to the tavern, where he spent his time and money in a very unprofitable way. The agent was surprised when his two visitors made their appearance. \"What brings you here, Hamlin?\" he asked, with scant ceremony. \"I come on a little matter of business,\" answered Mr. Hamlin, gravely. Mr. Fairfield concluded that the farmer had come to make an appeal to have his rent continued at the old rates, and answered, impatiently: \"I don\u0027t think it will be of much use. My mind is made up. Have you come on business, also?\" he asked, turning to Frank, with a sneer. \"Yes, sir,\" answered our hero, quietly. \"That will be of no use, either,\" said the agent. \"I am not in want of stationery, and, if I were, I should not buy of a peddler.\" \"I have not come here to sell stationery, Mr. Fairfield,\" said Frank. \"Then, may I take the liberty of asking what is your business here?\" \"I come on the same business as Mr. Hamlin,\" answered Frank, who preferred that his companion should introduce the subject. \"Look here, I have no time for trifling,\" said Mr. Fairfield, angrily. \"I am going out and can only spare you five minutes.\" \"Mr. Fairfield, I would advise you not to go out till you have heard what I have to say,\" said the farmer in a meaning tone. \"I certainly shall. You can call some other time.\" \"Another time will not do.\" \"Look here, sir! Do you know to whom you are talking? How dare you use such a tone to Mr. Percival\u0027s representative?\" \"I suppose you don\u0027t always expect to be Mr. Percival\u0027s representative?\" \"I suppose I shall die sometime, if that\u0027s what you mean; but I am not dead yet, as you will find. To pay you for your impertinence, I shall increase your rent more than I intended. I\u0027ll drive you out of town—that\u0027s what I\u0027ll do.\" This was accompanied by an angry stamp of the foot, which, however, did not frighten Mr. Hamlin much. \"I shall not pay a dollar more rent, nor shall I leave the farm I occupy,\" returned Mr. Hamlin, whose patience was exhausted by the rough insolence of the man before him. \"So you defy me, do you?\" demanded Fairfield, furiously. \"I shall resist your injustice, sir, or rather I would do so if you were able to carry out your threat. Luckily you have not the power.\" \"Have not the power? You will see if I have not the power!\" roared the angry agent. \"I give you notice that at the end of the quarter you must go, at any rate. After your insolence, I won\u0027t let you stay on any terms. I wouldn\u0027t let you stay if you would pay double the rent. Do you hear me, Hamlin?\" \"Yes, I hear you.\" Mr. Fairfield looked at the farmer in surprise. The latter seemed perfectly calm and undisturbed by his threat, though it was of the most serious nature. He had expected to see him humbled, and to hear him entreat a reversal of the sentence; but his tenant was thoroughly self-possessed, and appeared to care nothing for the agent\u0027s threats. \"You need not expect that I will change my mind,\" he added. \"Out of Jackson you must go. I know there is no other farm which you can hire, and while I am Mr. Percival\u0027s agent, you need expect no favors from me.\" \"I don\u0027t expect any while you are Mr. Percival\u0027s agent,\" said Mr. Hamlin. There was something in the farmer\u0027s tone that arrested the agent\u0027s attention and excited his curiosity, though it did not awaken his alarm, and he could not help saying: \"Then what do you expect? Do you think I am going to die?\" \"I don\u0027t expect that you will die or resign, Mr. Fairfield. You may be removed.\" \"Have you been writing to Mr. Percival?\" exclaimed Fairfield, in mingled anger and apprehension. \"No, sir; I have not communicated with him in any way. You would not give me his address.\" \"Of course I would not,\" said the agent, feeling relieved. \"It would be mere impertinence for you to write to him.\" \"Fortunately there is no immediate occasion for me to do so, as he has sent a representative here to investigate your official conduct.\" \"A representative!\" exclaimed Fairfield, now thoroughly startled. \"Where is he? I have not seen him.\" \"He is present,\" said Mr. Hamlin, indicating Frank. The agent broke into a scornful laugh. \"You? Why, you are a peddler!\" \"Only in appearance, Mr. Fairfield. I assumed that business in order not to attract attention or excite suspicion. I am really Mr. Percival\u0027s private secretary, as I can prove to your satisfaction.\" \"Is this true?\" he asked, in a changed voice. \"Yes, sir; quite true.\" \"Have you written to Mr. Percival?\" \"Yes, sir; and this afternoon I received a letter from him.\" \"What did he write?\" asked Fairfield, in a husky voice; for he was convinced now that Frank spoke the truth. \"He removes you, inclosing a check of three hundred dollars in place of notice, and appoints Mr. Hamlin in your place.\" \"Will you read this letter, sir?\" It was enough. Fairfield knew that his management would not stand investigation, and he yielded with a bad grace. Mr. Hamlin, the next day, to the great joy of the villagers, made known his appointment. Fairfield left town and drifted to California, where he became an adventurer, living in a miserable and precarious manner. Mr. Hamlin moved into his fine house, and Dick was sent to a school to prepare for college. The next day Frank started on his return to New York.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2988/82415.html","bookId":324,"book":{"id":324,"title":"Making His Way Frank Courtney\u0027s Struggle Upward","description":"简介： Two boys were walking in the campus of the Bridgeville Academy.
