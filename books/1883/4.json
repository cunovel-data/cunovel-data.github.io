{"id":84012,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Jeannie and Michael, her pack leaders, were stretched out on the carpet in front of a crackling fireplace. Baby Lara was lying between them. She would carefully extend a bare, pink foot (a foot that looked quite a bit like a pork chop with toes), giggle while her mother tickled it, then would withdraw, and slowly extend the other foot for her father. Jeannie had settled in, if not seamlessly, at least with minimal trouble after that first hellish week. Moira often wondered if Jeannie thought of her old life. She\u0027d never had friends to the manor, and never talked about her family. It was almost as if she hadn\u0027t really come alive until Michael had—almost literally!—swept her off her feet. Moira felt the usual envy crawling up from the back of her throat, and fought it down. She was happy for Michael. She was. And she adored Jeannie. It was just . . . hard to take sometimes. That was all. They were so happy, and she\u0027d just had the best sex of her life with a man who was trying to pump her for information. She delicately cleared her throat (\"Ah-CHEM!\"), gratified to hear the yells of dismay. After the bruising her pride (and bottom!) had endured today, she was grateful to be surrounded by family. Jeannie, her best friend and the pack\u0027s alpha female, was yelling the loudest. The leggy blonde rushed over to her, holding baby Lara and raking Moira with her piercing, blue-eyed gaze. \"What the hell happened to you?\" \"Glah!\" Lara added, waving a chubby hand. Moira caught the baby\u0027s hand, kissed it gently. Lara had her mother\u0027s lungs, and her father\u0027s charisma. With a headful of dark, glossy curls and eyes the color of good cognac, she was a striking infant. Michael took her in at a glance—bumps, bruises, smelling of sweaty sex and plastic, tired and pissed off. \"Who should I kill?\" he asked calmly. \"Are you okay?\" Derik asked, hurrying over to join their small group. \"Only my pride has been savaged.\" She felt the shower curtain start to slip and adjusted it. \"But probably permanently.\" Directly to Michael and Jeannie: \"Can we talk?\" \"Don\u0027t pull that,\" Derik protested. A broad-shouldered blonde, he and Moira had often been mistaken for siblings. Except for the fact that he towered over her, they looked a great deal alike, although Derik\u0027s eyes were the green of wet leaves. \"I want to hear what happened, too. Start with, \u0027I went for a walk,\u0027 and finish with \u0027then I walked in wearing a ducky shower curtain\u0027.\" \"Not now,\" she said, and hated it, because Derik really was like a brother to her, and she had no secrets from him. He\u0027d informally adopted her as a littermate when she\u0027d come to live at the mansion after her mother\u0027s death. But the pack leader deserved to hear about the threat first—Jared had named Michael specifically. Michael would decide who to tell, after. \"Come on, you guys. This shower curtain is itchy.\" Jeannie unceremoniously handed Lara to Derik. The baby yelped in protest, then shrieked happily as Derik tossed her four feet in the air. \"Later, Moira,\" he called after them. As in, You\u0027ll be telling me the whole story, right? \"Later, Dare.\" She used the nickname he\u0027d had since they\u0027d been small. The man would do anything if you triple-dog-dared him. She marched into the soundproofed den and waited until Michael shut the door. Then she told them how she\u0027d spent her afternoon. She left out nothing, save for how astounding and wonderful the sex had been. She was feeling very guilty about that. Michael\u0027s eyes were thoughtful, distant. \"Huh.\" \"\u0027Huh\u0027, he says.\" Jeannie shook her head in annoyance. \"Let\u0027s go back to the house and find out what this Jared\u0027s problem is.\" Moira could see every one of the woman\u0027s protective instincts was aroused. \"Or have him arrested.\" \"For?\" Michael asked mildly. \"Trespassing.\" She was scowling, but leaned into him for comfort. The scowl eased as he gently rubbed her shoulders. \"Being a flaming asshole. Rape.\" Moira coughed. \"Uh . . . it wasn\u0027t exactly . . .\" \"Never mind semantics! He\u0027s out to get you, Mike. I won\u0027t have it, I tell you I will not have it! \" Moira didn\u0027t say anything. Jeannie had become one of the family, and was so utterly fearless, it was often hard to remember she wasn\u0027t a werewolf. This was hardly the first time someone had come gunning for Michael. He controlled an admirable fortune and had three hundred thousand werewolves at his back. He was a tempting target. \"I really think we need to go over there and fire a warning shot into his spine,\" Jeannie continued. Michael was still rubbing her shoulders, and she raised her hands and closed them over his, gripping tightly. \"Fix him somehow. Neutralize his ass.\" \"What do you propose we do, dear one?\" \"Um, hmm, I\u0027m not sure, let me think, how about . . . lock him up! \" \"Then he skips bail and he\u0027s out and about with a hidden agenda. No.\" \"You\u0027re insufferable. Must you always think of every stupid little thing?\" He smiled at her. There weren\u0027t many people who dared speak to Michael Wyndham in such a way. The pack had been deferring to him since he was in training pants. He loved his wife\u0027s sharp tongue. \"Every stupid little thing? I thought of going after you, didn\u0027t I?\" \"Har, har.\" His smile faded and he looked right at Moira, who\u0027d been watching their interaction with undeniable longing. \"Moira, will you go back?\" \"Of course.\" She had figured out the problem as quickly as Michael had. Obviously Jared was a dangerous man . . . but was he alone? What exactly did he want, and why? And how far was he going to go in order to achieve his goal? Did he want to bring down just Michael, or Jeannie and baby Lara? The entire pack? For what purpose? When? She cursed herself for not having thought of this before jumping out the window. But there was time to make up for it. \"Let me get changed and I\u0027ll leave right away.\" \"Leave?\" Jeannie\u0027s fingers were twitching and Moira could tell, just tell, her friend was wishing for her gun. \"Why?\" Moira started sidling toward the door. When the Wyndhams fought, chandeliers shook and foundations cracked. And Jeannie, a good woman in all things, was still a human. She would never be pack, and could never truly understand their motivations. She\u0027d get it intellectually. But she would never feel it. \"Moira is going to go back to that house, and stay with Jared, and get all the information out of him she can, however she can.\" Michael said this with admirable calm, then waited. Jeannie\u0027s eyes widened and seemed to actually bulge. \"Stay put!\" she snapped at Moira, who was tentatively reaching for the doorknob. \"Moira, you don\u0027t have to go.\" \"Really, I\u0027d be more comfortable up in my room—\" \"I meant back to him. \" \"Of course I have to. We need to know what he\u0027s up to. And I\u0027m in a unique position—he thinks I\u0027m a cute bimbo twit. Also,\" she added, ignoring the rush of heat to her cheeks, \"he likes fucking me.\" Jeannie gaped at her, then swung toward Michael. \"Michael, don\u0027t make her go! She doesn\u0027t have to—to whore for us.\" Moira laughed, then clapped a hand over her mouth. \"Werewolves don\u0027t whore,\" he said, fighting a smile of his own, \"and I\u0027m not making Moira do anything. She only came here as a courtesy, you know. To—how d\u0027you put it? Keep us in the loop.\" He glanced at her over the top of his wife\u0027s head and they shared a moment of perfect understanding. \"It\u0027s not right,\" Jeannie said stubbornly. \"Protecting us? Your daughter? Our friends?\" \"Well . . . okay . . .\" She exhaled sharply, puffing blonde strands out of her face. \"I feel stupid having to say this out loud, but she shouldn\u0027t have to sleep with him.\" \"It\u0027s a sacrifice I\u0027m willing to make,\" Moira said, straight-faced, but her cheeks felt very warm now. Michael looked at her sharply, and arched a dark eyebrow. \"Moira,\" he said, \"can take care of herself. It\u0027s not like you to moralize, Jean.\" Jeannie looked from her husband to her friend. She looked at them the way one might look at a new form of life: with superstitious awe. After a long moment, Jeannie shook her head. Usually the difference between their cultures and species didn\u0027t seem so great, but today the gap yawned. \"You\u0027ll do as you please,\" she told him, \"you always do. But expecting Moira to put herself in danger for you, to have sex with a bad guy for you . . . that\u0027s going too far. It\u0027s—\" She glanced at Moira and stopped. Moira was staring at her with a total lack of comprehension. \"Oh, forget it. I\u0027m obviously the only one who\u0027s got a problem with this. Fine, knock yourself out, have a grand old time, don\u0027t forget to write.\" She marched across the room, punctuating her exit by slamming the door. Michael turned and looked at the couch. \"It\u0027s about as uncomfortable as it looks,\" he mournfully informed Moira. \"What a pity I\u0027ll be sleeping there, probably for the rest of the week.\" Who are you kidding? Try a month. Moira smiled wanly. \"It\u0027s actually a little flattering—if she didn\u0027t think so highly of me, she wouldn\u0027t have such a problem with me going back. But I can\u0027t think of how to explain it to her . . . why it\u0027s not a problem. Why I have to do it . . . in fact, why I should be halfway back to the house already.\" \"Yes, but first this. You\u0027ve got to be really careful. Not just for your own sake. If Jared gets too close . . .\" He smiled, showing his teeth. They looked very white and very sharp and might have fooled someone slow to notice the smile didn\u0027t reach his eyes. \"I\u0027d hate for my wife to have to shoot another bad guy on my property. The noise might wake the baby.\" \"He won\u0027t get close to them. And even if he did,\" she said matter-of-factly, \"it will be very hard for him to harm my lady and my future sovereign while I\u0027m chewing on his spinal cord.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jared-s-wolf-wyndham-werewolf-2/page-4.html","bookId":1883,"book":{"id":1883,"title":"Jared\u0027s Wolf (Wyndham Werewolf #2)","description":"Storyline: Jared\u0027s Wolf (Wyndham Werewolf #2) Jared Rocke will do anything avenge his sister\u0027s death, even believe in werewolves.
