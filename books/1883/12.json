You know, it wouldn\u0027t hurt you to call him Michael. Stop trying to get up.\" She sat down in the chair next to the bed, and propped her leg up on the mattress. The swelling was nasty, but Jared couldn\u0027t see the lump of broken bone any longer. Her leg was tightly wrapped in elastic. Not plaster.\n \"Huh. I guess it didn\u0027t break.\"\n \"Jared.\"\n \"Lucky for you, sugar, because that could have been nasty.\"\n \"Jared.\"\n \"And by the way, you must have had some kind of adrenaline rush in that hell house. You were tossing Geraldine around like she was made of paper. It was like watching the Hulk. A short blonde Hulk.\"\n \" Jared. \"\n \"And I\u0027m not staying here, cutie. Not even for you.\" He tossed the blankets back. \"This place creeps me right the hell out. I\u0027m heading back to my place, and I\u0027d love it if you came with me. In fact, I insist on it. I need a sexy nurse to take care of me.\"\n She was staring at him. Why was she looking at him so strangely? Part of him knew, part of him was pulling back the veil so he could see. He willed the understanding away. \"Moira? Come on, let\u0027s book.\n What do you say, babe?\"\n \"I can\u0027t do that.\"\n \"Sure, it\u0027s easy. We\u0027ll scoot down to the truck, hop in, make a quick stop at the Colonel\u0027s—I\u0027d kill another werewolf just for some fried chicken—\"\n \" I\u0027m a werewolf.\"\n He didn\u0027t blink. \"No.\"\n Her eyes widened. For a minute he thought she was going to fall out of the chair. She\u0027d clearly been braced for any reaction except calm denial. \"Yes, I am. I\u0027m a werewolf. Tonight when the moon rises I\u0027ll be hairier than the drain in the locker room at the YMCA.\"\n He calmly folded his arms across his chest. \"No.\"\n She leapt to her feet. Her cheeks were flushed, her forehead burning like a lamp. \"Jared, stop it! You know I am, you must know. I\u0027m a werewolf.\"\n He shouted, although it hurt his head like hell. \"I\u0027m not having this discussion, no way, uh-uh, count me out, folks.\" Of course she wasn\u0027t. It was impossible. They were the monsters. She was Moira. Ergo, nuh-uh, not happening, no way.\n She bellowed so loud he feared for the mirror across the room. \"I\u0027m a werewolf!\"\n No slouch in the vocals department, he roared back, \"The hell you are!\"\n Moira\u0027s temper snapped. \"Of course I am, you idiot! Adrenaline rush! Come on!\"\n \"Science is on my side.\"\n \"Bullshit is on your side. You would have seen it before now, if you\u0027d allowed yourself.\"\n \"You are not ,\" he repeated stubbornly.\n \"I am, so, a werewolf.\"\n \"You\u0027re just saying that so I don\u0027t think they\u0027re all scum. Which, by the way, they are.\"\n \"They aren\u0027t, and I am one.\"\n \"No, you\u0027re not.\"\n \" How can you say that! You can only fool yourself for so long.\"\n \"Because I can\u0027t care about one!\" he roared. \"That\u0027s absolutely impossible and not in the plan ! You\u0027re not you\u0027re not YOU ARE NOT ! You leap around like a monkey because you\u0027ve got a gymnastics background, you heal quickly because—I dunno, you\u0027ve got a super immune system—you don\u0027t get tired but big deal, one of my buddies can go for three days without sleep, he does it all the time and it never bothers him except he gets really bad breath from drinking all that Mountain Dew . . . people are different.\"\n She was holding her head in her hands. \"Oh, my God. You\u0027re a moron.\"\n \"I mean, don\u0027t get me wrong.\" He could hear himself talking fast and faster, almost babbling, but it was impossible to stop. \"You\u0027re definitely weird. I\u0027ll give you that. But the stuff you can do, it\u0027s all within the realms of good old homo sapiens. \"\n \"So I\u0027m a liar? Or just crazy?\"\n He had no answer for that one. After a long pause, he said, \"I don\u0027t know. Maybe after working for werewolves all this time you think you\u0027re . . . I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m not the brains of this team.\"\n \"You got that right,\" she muttered.\n \"I just know you\u0027re not one of them. You\u0027re not. I won\u0027t believe it.\" And you can\u0027t make me, he added silently, stubbornly.\n \"Why?\"\n Because she had nothing, not one fucking thing, in common with Geraldine. Because he wanted to marry her and have kids with her and his kids weren\u0027t going to be fuzzy. Because his sister\u0027s killer was dead and he wanted to finally build a life without grief. Because.\n \"I just won\u0027t.\"\n \"You said you couldn\u0027t care about a werewolf,\" she said slowly, and now she stood, and walked to the door (without a limp, his mind pointed out treacherously) and turned. Her eyes shone with unshed tears.\n \"I take that to mean you think you care about me.\"\n \"Yes.\" He paused. \"I\u0027m sorry. I had about a thousand nicer ways planned to tell you. I didn\u0027t mean to just blurt it out in mid-yell. I do care, Moira. From the minute you hightailed it down the road dressed in my shower curtain, I never wanted anything bad to happen to you, ever.\"\n She winced away from him, as if his words hurt her. \"You care about a lie then, Jared. There\u0027s no shame in not knowing things. But I won\u0027t be with someone who puts on blinders on purpose. And won\u0027t take them off, no matter what he hears and what he sees.\" She wrenched open the door and fled.\n \"Moira, don\u0027t go!\" He slapped his hands over his eyes and writhed in agony. \"Oh, God, my head . . .\n fuck.\"\n The door slammed open, hard enough to crash against the wall and stick as the doorknob was imbedded in the wood.\n A large, blonde man filled the doorway. Filled. His hair was the color of the sun, cut brutally short. His eyes were a deep, mesmerizing green. He was broad-shouldered and the T-shirt he wore did nothing to hide his excellent muscle definition. Given the man\u0027s ridiculously good looks and powerful build, Jared assumed he was dealing with a Wyndham werewolf.\n \"I\u0027m going to shove your head so far up your ass,\" the man said with ominous calm, \"that you\u0027ll be able to kiss your own colon.\"\n \"Go chase a mail truck,\" Jared snapped. \"I\u0027ve got bigger problems than whatever bit you on the ass today.\"\n The man blinked. Held up one finger. Paused. Turned. Left. Jared heard a muffled sound from the hall—a snort? A chuckle? Then the stranger returned, looking stormier than ever. \"You blew it, Monkeyboy.\"\n \"It\u0027s Rocke.\"\n \"Moira hasn\u0027t given a guy so much as a come-hither look in years, and you had her. She was yours, all you had to do was ask! She saves your life, helps you avenge your sister, then finally screws up her courage and tells your bigoted sorry ass the truth, and you rejected everything she is.\"\n \"Did you actually say come-hither?\"\n \"Stop making me laugh. This is a serious thing, ape face.\"\n \"It\u0027s Jared Rocke , do I have to paint it on my forehead?\"\n \"I\u0027m going to throw you out the window.\" This in the same tone someone else might have said, \"I\u0027m going to fix you a cup of coffee.\" \"The fall will probably kill you, but you\u0027ll be out of Moira\u0027s hair, and it\u0027ll make me feel better. Also, you deserve multiple broken bones for making my friend cry.\"\n So saying, the man moved with that same terrifying quickness Geraldine had demonstrated. He seized the footboard of the bed and shoved. As if it was sliding across ice, the bed zipped across the carpet and slammed against the far wall . . . uncomfortably close to the window. But to Jared\u0027s human senses, the man had finished with \". . . making my friend cry.\" and suddenly his bed was against the window.\n He supposed he should have been terrified.\n \"Bring it on, German Shepherd!\" His head pounding, Jared thrashed feebly among the blankets. \"As soon as I get out of this bed, we\u0027ll see who goes out the window!\"\n \"Crud.\" The man blew out his breath in disgust. \"I forgot your injuries wouldn\u0027t have healed yet. You guys are made of tissue paper, I swear.\"\n \"Derik!\"\n \"What?\" The man turned. Wyndham\u0027s wife stood in the doorway, hands on her hips. Jared inwardly groaned.\n \"Keep your hands off him, \"Jeannie warned, looking cutely threatening.\n \"I was only going to slap him around a little,\" Derik said defensively. \"Wasn\u0027t even going to break the skin. Much.\"\n \"You and what army, Liver Snack breath?\" Jared jeered.\n \"See? See? This guy\u0027s an asshole squared. And he made Moira cry.\" Derik kicked the footboard. Jared heard the \u0027crunch\u0027 of splintering wood. \"For which he will bleed and puke and beg.\"\n \"Moira would jam your ass up to your shoulderblades—\"\n \"Worth it,\" Derik said stubbornly.\n \"—and you know it. Besides, that\u0027s why I\u0027m here. Ole Rockhead\u0027s got a concussion, so I figured I\u0027d shriek at him for half an hour or so until he agreed to go after Moira.\"\n At last the bickering couple had his attention. \"Go after her? Where\u0027s she gone?\"\n \"You think she was going to stay here ? Tonight? She\u0027s out of here, pal. I doubt she\u0027ll be back until she gets word that you\u0027ve moved on. Let me know,\" Derik added with a giant, toothy, terrifying smile, \"if you need help packing.\"\n Jared threw back the bedcovers again and stood. Instantly, the floor rushed up to his head. \"What the—?\"\n Jeannie and Derik were bending over him. \"You can\u0027t go anywhere,\" she informed him, while he tried to get up off the floor. \"Geraldine really rattled your cage. You\u0027ve got a bad concussion and about a zillion minor injuries.\"\n \"My knees work,\" he said through gritted teeth. Slowly, painfully, he rolled over onto all fours and started crawling for the door. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jared-s-wolf-wyndham-werewolf-2/page-12.html","bookId":1883,"book":{"id":1883,"title":"Jared\u0027s Wolf (Wyndham Werewolf #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Jared\u0027s Wolf (Wyndham Werewolf #2) \n Jared Rocke will do anything avenge his sister\u0027s death, even believe in werewolves.
