{"id":84017,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Wyndham and his wife looked at each other. Jared was still trying to figure out why he hadn\u0027t loaded his gun and killed everyone. Except Moira. Probably except Moira—he still couldn\u0027t believe she\u0027d gotten the drop on him so easily. He couldn\u0027t believe he was still thinking about the clothesline coiled neatly in the garage! \u0027Rope tricks\u0027, she\u0027d said. Jesus. The woman—Jeannie—had thrown him off-guard, that was why he was off his stride. She was about as adorable as Moira, and what a temper! She hung around werewolves all day—was married to one!—and hadn\u0027t been killed or mutilated or anything like that. It was sure something to think about. Then there was his pretty, purple-eyed Moira. She was hiding stuff from him, but he was seeing it less as duplicity and more as loyalty. There was nothing he admired more than loyalty . . . hell, loyalty to his family had brought him here. It was all pretty damned confusing. He hadn\u0027t counted on it becoming confusing. It had seemed pretty fucking black and white just a few days ago. \"Gerald probably did kill your sister—and I\u0027m very sorry,\" Michael said. \"Really really sorry, Rococo,\" Jeannie added. \"I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d do if something horrible happened to Michael or Lara.\" Sympathy from the dogs—well, the dog and his wife—he hadn\u0027t expected. He had to look away from the genuine kindness on their faces. Liking the dogs was not in the plan. No, sir. \"I only met the man twice . . . and the second time I killed him,\" Jeannie added candidly. Jared looked back in a hurry. \"Jeannie . . .\" \"Michael, we\u0027ve got to tell him.\" She took a big slug of her drink, and went on passionately, unaware of her milk mustache. \"If I go to jail, I go to jail . . . but I don\u0027t think Jared\u0027s the type to rat out the killer of a killer.\" \"No, ma\u0027am, I am not. Why don\u0027t you tell me what happened.\" \"Yes, why don\u0027t I? Okay. Gerald was this disgusting horrible werewolf—and no, that\u0027s not redundant, so don\u0027t say it. Although it\u0027s an opinion I had myself not too long ago,\" she added, giving her husband a formidable frown. \"Anyway. This jerkoff was a wife beater, a puppy kicker, a daughter smacker. And he got the idea in his head that his wife was giving him too many girl babies . . . he really wanted a son. Never mind biology and X chromosomes and that any idiot knows that sperm dictates the baby\u0027s sex . . .\" \"Honey . . .\" \"Right, right, I\u0027m staying focused. I am. Anyway. He kills his wife—nice, huh? And my husband decided the guy\u0027s ass was grass, except Gerald\u0027s daughters—he had three—intervened on their dad\u0027s behalf. Begged for his life. So Michael felt sorry for the girls and banished Gerald from the pack. So he went away and did whatever rogue werewolves do. \"Then, when I got pregnant and turned up here, Gerald snuck back to town and tried to kidnap me. He got onto the grounds during a full moon and hurt a lot of people, so I shot him. The end.\" \"And when was this?\" \"Almost a year ago.\" Jared shook his head. \"That\u0027s not right. There have been six or seven murders since then. Same M.O. I\u0027ve been researching every murder that matched my sister\u0027s.\" Moira turned to him, surprised. \"A serial killer? I thought you were focused on your sister.\" \"I started out focused on one death. Then, when I started digging, I realized there was a lot more going on.\" \"All the murders happening during a full moon,\" Michael said. \"Yes. That\u0027s how I knew it was one of you . . .\" Freaks? Monsters? Degenerate killers? \". . . people.\" Michael let that pass. \"And do the victims all look alike?\" Wyndham, Jared realized with growing excitement, knew something. \"Yes. They\u0027re all between five foot two and five foot four. They\u0027ve all got long dark hair parted on the left, and blue eyes. Very pale skin.\" Jared watched Moira\u0027s eyes widen with understanding. \"What is it, babe?\" \"You\u0027ve just described Gerald\u0027s late wife,\" she said, almost gasped. \"That\u0027s exactly what she looked like!\" \"But Gerald\u0027s dead,\" Jeannie protested. \"Nobody\u0027s got any reason to kill women who look like his wife.\" \"Are you sure he\u0027s dead? I mean . . . he\u0027s a werewolf.\" \"Yeah, that\u0027s right.\" Jeannie replied, nodding. \"A werewolf. Not a living god.\" Michael coughed modestly. \"Well . . .\" \"Shut up, honey. Werewolves are perfectly mortal. I put multiple bullets in Gerald\u0027s head. He\u0027s deader than the dodo bird, trust me, Rocky.\" \"Well, his daughters aren\u0027t,\" Moira said quietly. \"Maybe we should go have a talk with them. Don\u0027t they still live around here?\" Then she froze. Everything within her locked for a long moment; shock had rendered her incapable of moving, even blinking. \"Moira . . . Moira!\" Jared shook her arm lightly. \"What is it? What\u0027s the matter?\" She gulped. Looked at Jared, then at Michael. \"Geraldine,\" she said hoarsely. \"Geraldine killed Jared\u0027s sister. Geraldine killed them all.\" Uproar. But Jared said nothing. Just kept his gaze on Moira while she continued. \"Remember, Michael? She was here early this week. Passing through town, she said. She\u0027s a loner, a drifter . . . Geraldine—\" \"Geraldine, named for her father,\" Michael said with deadly quiet. \"Geraldine, the eldest. The son Gerald wanted more than he wanted anything. How long did he pour poison in her ears, I wonder? How long has she been killing her mother over and over again, to appease her father, himself a year in his grave? If we can track her movements . . . match them to the deaths . . .\" \"Oh, she can\u0027t!\" Jeannie protested. \"You guys are wrong. And it\u0027s not me being humanly naive, it\u0027s not. You\u0027re wrong, is all . . . it\u0027s not Geraldine. She was in this house. She played with my daughter, for God\u0027s sake. She\u0027s the sweetest thing, even nicer than Moira.\" Moira, who knew herself to be far from nice, just shook her head numbly. And Michael, who\u0027d seen Moira tear apart two armed men once upon a time, simply said, \"Gerald did not kill those women. Geraldine did. And you know it, Jeannie . . . just give it a minute.\" \"No,\" she said stubbornly, but a species of frightened doubt drifted across her face. \"She didn\u0027t do this. I\u0027ve had her in my home, and she didn\u0027t do this thing.\" \"That may be true, ma\u0027am,\" Jared said politely, but he was standing up, \"but appearances can be deceiving. As everyone in this room probably knows. I\u0027m going to go check it out. Bye.\" \"Not by yourself, you\u0027re not,\" Moira said, and was on her feet and after him in an instant. \"Indeed,\" Michael said. He was on his feet. Jared spun. \"No way. This isn\u0027t yours.\" Michael and Jared were now chest to chest, and Moira saw with dismay that her leader\u0027s shoulders were up and he was leaning far forward, almost looming over Jared, although the men were close in height. The classic stance of a werewolf defending his territory. \"You\u0027re wrong about that, Jared. In fact, the plain truth is, this isn\u0027t yours. \" \"Tell that to my sister. Where were you when one of your damned out-of-control dogs was ripping my sister in two?\" Moira winced. Michael\u0027s eyes—a weird gold color—went even more yellow. His mouth thinned and turned down in a sorrowful bow. \"Exactly. That\u0027s why this—this ungodly mess is mine. For your sister. For all the other sisters. I was asleep at the switch. Now I have to fix it.\" \"Um, hello?\" Jeannie tapped Michael on the shoulder. \"Any reason you both can\u0027t go? I mean, don\u0027t get me wrong, all this chest-beating and me-boss batcrap is enthralling, really, but don\u0027t we have a murderer to catch?\" Michael unhunched. Jared turned to look at Mrs. Wyndham, who stared back with raised eyebrows. \"She\u0027s right,\" he said after a long moment. Moira sighed with relief. \"She often is,\" Michael said fondly. \"What a pity it appears to go straight to her head.\" \"What a pity you\u0027re going to bed with a fractured skull, pal.\" But Jeannie smiled as she said it, and the tension in the room ratcheted down several notches. Chapter Ten Who would go and who would stay turned out to be a moot point as Geraldine had a job. \"Which I s\u0027pose we should have thought of,\" Jeannie commented. Interestingly, Geraldine was a cemetery caretaker. According to her supervisor, the job was seasonal and Geraldine attended to it when she was in town. \"Sure I gave her the job,\" he replied to Michael\u0027s questions. \"Felt sorry for her. Nasty business with her dad, eh?\" By necessity, Geraldine\u0027s hours were flexible. As she could be at work or at home, the two couples split up. Michael declined to let the rest of the family in on the problem, preferring instead to leave Lara in the pack\u0027s protection. \"If we can\u0027t handle this ourselves,\" he explained, \"we deserve to get eaten. And if we do get eaten, I want to know Lara\u0027s safe.\" \"Yuck-o,\" was Jeannie\u0027s only comment. Based on what the cemetery supervisor had said, the group felt sure Geraldine was most likely to be at work, so Michael and Jeannie took that address. On that issue, Michael would not budge. \"Arrogant asshole,\" Jared growled, jerking the car into reverse and squealing down the cemetery entrance—backward. \"Yes.\" \"Pushes people around all damn day.\" \"Yes.\" \"Wife seems nice, though. In a scary kind of way.\" \"She\u0027s beyond marvelous.\" He grunted. \"How come you didn\u0027t mention it?\" He brought the car around. Tires squealed. Gravel flew. Moira, nigh-invulnerable werewolf, tightened her seatbelt. \"What?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/jared-s-wolf-wyndham-werewolf-2/page-9.html","bookId":1883,"book":{"id":1883,"title":"Jared\u0027s Wolf (Wyndham Werewolf #2)","description":"Storyline: Jared\u0027s Wolf (Wyndham Werewolf #2) Jared Rocke will do anything avenge his sister\u0027s death, even believe in werewolves.
