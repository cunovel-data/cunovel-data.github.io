{"id":17808,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II SHOVELSTRODE","content":"A row of lights gleamed from Shovelstrode Manor, on the north slope of Ashdown Forest. Shovelstrode was in Sussex, and looked straight over the woods into Surrey and Kent. Round it the pines heaped up till they gave a ragged edge to the hill behind it. Into the house they cast many shadows, and even when at night they were curtained out of the lighted rooms, one could hear them rustling and thrumming a strange tune. Tony Strife crept up the back stairs to the schoolroom. She paused for a moment and listened to a distant buzz of voices. Her mother must be having visitors, so she would not go near her—she would sit in the schoolroom till it was time to dress for dinner. Tony was sixteen, healthy and clean-limbed, with a thick mouse-coloured plait between her shoulders. She wore a school-girl\u0027s blouse and skirt, with a tie of her school cricket-colours. She had in her manner all the mixture of confidence and deference which points to one who is paramount in her own little world, but is for some reason cast adrift in another where she has never been more than subordinate. The schoolroom was in darkness. The fire was unlighted and the blinds were up, so that the shadows of the pines rushed over the square of moonlight on the floor, waving and gliding and curtseying in the wind. Tony, who had expected[Pg 21] drawn blinds and a cosy fireside, was a little dismayed at the dreariness of her kingdom. \"I wonder if they got my postcard,\" she thought forlornly. But the schoolroom was the schoolroom, with or without a fire, and her own special province now that Awdrey had grown up, and exchanged its austere boundaries for a world of calls and dances and chiffons and flirtations. It was a little bit of the glorious land of school from which she had been so abruptly exiled. For the first time since her return a certain warmth glowed in her heart—she sat down on the window-sill and looked out at the pines. She wondered how soon she would be able to go back to school. Perhaps there would be no more cases, and the clear, all-sufficient life would start again at the half-term. Meantime she would write every week to her three best friends and the mistress she \"had a rave on,\" she would work up her algebra and perhaps get her remove into the sixth next term; and she would finish that beastly nightgown she had been struggling with ever since Easter, and be able to start a frock, like the rest of the form. Her calculations were interrupted by the sound of footsteps in the passage and a rather strident voice calling— \"Tony! Tony!\" The next minute the door flew open, and a girl a few years older than herself burst in. \"Hullo!—so you are home! I saw your box in the hall, and swore you must have come back for some reason or other; but of course mother[Pg 22] wouldn\u0027t believe me. What on earth have you come for?\" \"They\u0027ve got whooping-cough at school, and Mrs. Arkwright sent us all home. Didn\u0027t mother get my postcard?\" \"Postcard! of course not. We\u0027d no idea you were coming, and your room isn\u0027t ready for you, or anything. You ought to have known better than to send only a card—they get kept back for days sometimes. And when you arrived, why didn\u0027t you come into the drawing-room and see mother, instead of sneaking up here?\" \"I thought you had visitors—I could hear them talking. I meant to come down after I\u0027d changed.\" \"I see. Well, you\u0027d better come now and speak to mother. She\u0027s quite worried about your being here, or rather about my saying you\u0027re here when she says you aren\u0027t.\" \"Right-O!\" and Tony followed her sister out of the room. In a way Awdrey was like her, but with a more piquant, impertinent cast of features. She was dressed in the latest combination of fashion and sport, with a very short skirt to display her pretty ankles and purple silk stockings. She was strongly scented with some pleasant, flower-like scent, which, however, made Tony wrinkle up her nose with disgust. \"You were quite right about there being visitors,\" said the elder girl in a more friendly tone. \"Captain le Bourbourg was here, and as only mother and I were in, I went with him to the door—complications, of course!\" [Pg 23] \"Ass,\" said Tony shortly. Awdrey giggled, apparently without resentment, and the next minute they were in the drawing-room. The drawing-room at Shovelstrode was an emasculate room, plunged deep in yellow and dull green. The furniture had a certain ineffectiveness about it, in spite of its beauty. The only thing which was neither delicate nor indefinite was the heavily beamed ceiling, reflecting the firelight. The girls\u0027 mother lay on a sofa between the fire and the half-curtained window, just where she could see the moon. She wore a yellow silk wrapper, and on her breast lay dull, strangely set stones. She was reading a little book of unorthodox mysticism, and others, in floppy suède bindings, were on the table beside her. \"Why, Antoinette!\" she cried. \"Whatever are you here for, child?\" \"They had whooping-cough at school,\" said Awdrey glibly, \"and sent her home—and the silly idiot wrote and told us on a postcard, which we\u0027ll probably get some time next week.\" Lady Strife sighed. \"It\u0027s very disturbing, my dear, very disturbing—for me, that\u0027s to say. And as for your father, I expect he\u0027ll be furious. He hates things happening in a disorderly way and people being in the wrong place.\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" said Tony, \"but I\u0027ll work all the time I\u0027m here, so I really shan\u0027t lose anything by it.\" \"Well, it\u0027s not your fault, of course,\" rather[Pg 24] doubtfully. \"Come and give me a kiss,\" she added, realising that the ceremony had been omitted. \"How are you, mother?\" \"Oh, about the same, thank you. Weak of body, but not, I trust, weak of soul. I am wonderfully comforted by this little book of Sakrata Balkrishna\u0027s. Our soul, he says, Tony, sits within us as a watcher, holding aloof from the poor, suffering body, and weaving a new mantle of flesh for its next Manvantara.\" \"Buddhism?...\" asked Tony awkwardly. \"Buddhism! My dear child—as if I would have anything to do with that modern corruption of pure Brahminical faith! No, Antoinette, this is the ancient Vedantin philosophy, as old as the world. By the way, has your box come?\" \"Yes. I brought it with me in the taxi.\" \"The taxi! You were lucky to find one at the station.\" \"I didn\u0027t find it. A man got it for me from the Dorset Arms.\" \"A man!\" cried Awdrey. \"Yes, quite an ordinary sort of man, but rather decent.\" \"I wonder who he was. How romantic, Tony!\" \"Rats! It wasn\u0027t in the least romantic. When I got out of the station I found the car wasn\u0027t there to meet me, and all the cabs were gone, and I didn\u0027t know what to do. Then rather a nasty-looking man came along, and asked me what was the matter, and when I told him, he said I\u0027d better spend the night in East Grinstead as it was so late,[Pg 25] and he knew of a very nice place I could go to. I didn\u0027t like to refuse, as he seemed so polite and interested, but of course I wanted to come here, and I was awfully glad when another man came and said he could get me a cab quite easily. The first man didn\u0027t seem to like it, though—perhaps he had some poor relation who let lodgings.\" \"Tony!\" cried her sister. \"You really mustn\u0027t go about alone. You\u0027re much too innocent.\" \"My darling child,\" wailed her mother, \"my dove unsoiled by knowledge!\" Tony looked surprised, but her answer was checked by the sound of footsteps in the hall. \"Girls, there\u0027s your father!\" cried Lady Strife. \"Now, Tony, you will have to explain. And remember I hate a scene—it clogs my soul with matter.\" \"Right-O, mother!\" and Tony hurried out into the passage. Here she managed to get through the \"scene,\" such as it was. Sir Gambier Strife was a man to whom time and place were all-important, and as the time of Term was inevitably linked with the place of School, he felt justly indignant at the separation of the two. \"Whooping-cough! People were such milksops nowadays. When he was a boy the sooner one got whooping-cough the more one\u0027s relations were pleased. How old was Tony? Sixteen? Then the sooner she had whooping-cough the better.\" This, however, was all said in rather a low voice, Sir Gambier realising as much as any one the[Pg 26] importance of not clogging his wife\u0027s soul with matter. By the time he entered the drawing-room, he was talking of other things. \"I was down at Wilderwick this evening—you know that place at the bottom of Wilderwick hill, where the Furlongers live?\" \"Yes. Sparrow Hall.\" \"That\u0027s it. Well, this evening there was a flag tied to the chimney. I asked old Carter what it was all about, and he said they\u0027re expecting the other brother home—the one that\u0027s been in gaol for the last three years.\" \"It\u0027s a long time since I\u0027ve seen the Furlongers,\" said Awdrey, \"they\u0027ve been lying low for the last few months, and I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever seen the one who\u0027s been in gaol.\" \"I saw him three years ago, just after we came here. He was swaggering about the Kent end of their land with his gun. He won\u0027t do much swaggering there in future. By Jove! it must have hit \u0027em hard to sell that property to old Lowe.\" \"They\u0027ve only got a poky little farm now. But, father, do tell us what he\u0027s like, that youngest Furlonger—he sounds interesting.\" \"Oh, he wasn\u0027t much to look at—a great strong fellow, for ever showing his teeth. But I\u0027ve been told he\u0027s got brains, plenty of \u0027em, wouldn\u0027t have landed himself in prison if he hadn\u0027t.\" \"When is he coming out?\" \"They were expecting him this evening, I believe. Hullo! what\u0027s the matter?\" [Pg 27] \"Oh, it\u0027s suddenly struck me,\" cried Awdrey. \"Perhaps he was Tony\u0027s man.\" \"Tony\u0027s man!—what d\u0027you mean?\" Awdrey poured forth the story of her sister\u0027s adventure. \"She said he was an awful-looking man, and goodness knows where he\u0027d have landed her if the other man hadn\u0027t turned up and scared him away. I\u0027m sure he must have been Furlonger, it isn\u0027t likely there\u0027d be two scoundrels like that about.\" Sir Gambier turned red. \"I won\u0027t have you girls mixed up in such things.\" \"She didn\u0027t want to be mixed up in it,\" interrupted Awdrey, \"it wasn\u0027t her fault. But it\u0027s lucky the other man turned up. You don\u0027t know who he was, I suppose, Tony?\" \"He said his name was Smith.\" \"That doesn\u0027t help us much. But, by Jove! how Furlonger must hate him!\" \"We don\u0027t know he was Furlonger.\" \"He must have been; it\u0027s just the thing a ticket-of-leave convict would do—try to victimise an innocent-looking girl.\" \"I\u0027m not innocent-looking!\" cried Tony indignantly. \"Well, I shan\u0027t argue the point with you. You must have looked pretty green for him to have said what he did. By the way, what was Furlonger locked up for, father?\" \"Something to do with the Wickham Rubber Companies. Farming wasn\u0027t good enough for him, so he took to finance—with the result that the[Pg 28] whole family was ruined; had to sell all their land, except a few inches round the house—and the young man got three years in gaol into the bargain.\" \"Wickham got ten—so Furlonger can\u0027t be as bad as Wickham.\" \"He\u0027s a rotten scoundrel, I tell you. Diddled thousands of respectable people out of their money. Then put up the most brazen defence—said that at the beginning he had no idea of the unsoundness of the scheme; \u0027at the beginning,\u0027 mark you—confesses quite coolly that he knew it was a fraud before the end.\" \"Well, I think it rather sporting of him,\" said Awdrey. \"He may have a beautiful soul,\" murmured Lady Strife; \"why do people always look at actions rather than motives? Poor young Furlonger may have sinned more divinely than many pray. It\u0027s motive that makes all the difference. Motive may make the robbing of a till a far finer action than the endowing of a church.\" \"Tut, tut, my dear! What a thought to put into the girls\u0027 heads. Besides, it isn\u0027t as if the only thing against the Furlongers was that one of \u0027em\u0027s been in gaol. They\u0027re the most disreputable lot I ever met, don\u0027t care twopence for any one\u0027s good opinion.\" \"They\u0027re quite well connected really, aren\u0027t they?\" said Awdrey. \"Yes, that\u0027s the worst of it. Their mother was a daughter of Lord Woodshire\u0027s, and I believe their father had rather a fine place near Chichester. But[Pg 29] he went to the bad—ahem! shocking story—died in Paris—tut, tut!—the children were left to shift for themselves, and bought Sparrow Hall with their mother\u0027s money—all the Chichester estate was chucked away by old Furlonger.\" \"I think they sound rather interesting. It\u0027s a pity the youngest should have embarked on the white slave traffic.\" \"White slave traffic!—hush, my dear. Young girls don\u0027t talk about such things.\" \"No—they get mixed up in \u0027em instead. Tony, I hope you\u0027ll meet your Mr. Smith again.\" \"He\u0027s not my Mr. Smith,\" said Tony hotly. \"Oh, it\u0027s impossible to talk to any one rationally to-night! Father\u0027s started on \u0027young girls,\u0027 and Tony\u0027s trying to make out she was born yesterday.\" She seized her sister by the arm. \"Come upstairs and dress for dinner.\" Tony was only too glad to escape, and they went up to widely different rooms. Awdrey\u0027s was furnished with a telling combination of coquetry and sport. Silver toilet articles and embroidered cushions contrasted with her hunting-crop over the mantelpiece, her tennis racket on the wall. What struck one most, however, was the number of men\u0027s photographs which crowded the place. From frames of every conceivable fabric they stared with bold, glassy eyes. Awdrey smiled at them lovingly, as they woke either memory or emotion. She had once said that the male sex was roughly divisible into two groups—G.P.\u0027s and H.P.\u0027s—Grand Passions and Hideous[Pg 30] Pasts. Tony gave them a scornful glance as she passed the door. Her own room was austere and white. An indefinable coolness haunted its empty corners and clear spaces. There were no photographs, as she had not yet unpacked the photographs of her girl friends which usually adorned the mantelpiece. There were only three pictures—a Memling Madonna, Holbein\u0027s Portrait of a Young Woman, and Watts\u0027 Sir Galahad, beloved of schoolgirls. Tony sat down on the bed and began to unplait her hair. \"What a fool Awdrey is,\" she murmured to herself, \"always thinking of love, and all that rot.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1936/55522.html","bookId":772,"book":{"id":772,"title":"The Three Furlongers","description":"简介： The twilight was dropping over the fields of three countiesSurrey, Kent and Sussexall touching in the woods round Sparrow Hall.
