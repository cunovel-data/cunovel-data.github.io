{"id":17817,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI DISILLUSION AT SIXTEEN","content":"Rather to Tony\u0027s surprise, she and her father drove in silence. As a matter of fact, Sir Gambier was baffled by his younger daughter. Awdrey he could have dealt with easily enough—he was used to Awdrey\u0027s scrapes. But Tony had always been more or less impersonal—a vague some one for whom one paid school-bills, who came home for the holidays, made herself pretty scarce, and then went back to school again, to write prim letters home every Sunday. It was a new idea that this half-realised being should suddenly show herself possessed of a personality in the form of a scrape—and such a scrape too! Furlonger! He grunted with fury, but—as would never have been the case if he had had Awdrey to deal with—he said nothing. \n \n Once, however, he looked sideways, and noticed how Tony was sitting. Her back was bent, and her arms rested on her knees, the hands clenched between them; her chin was a little thrust forward into the darkness through which they rushed. \n \n At last they reached Shovelstrode. The moon was high above the pines, and they seemed to be waving in waters of silver. The house-front shimmered in the white light, as the motor pulsed up to it. Tony climbed down, and stood stiffly on the step. \n \n [Pg 123] \n \n \"You\u0027d better go to your room,\" said Sir Gambier in muddled rage. \"I—I expect your mother will want to speak to you.\" \n \n \"Very well,\" said Tony. \n \n She walked quickly upstairs, went into her room, and sat down on the bed. A square of moonlight lay on the floor, and the moving shadows curtsied across it. They and the pines outside seemed to be nodding to her grotesquely under the moon—they seemed to be mocking her for her great illusion lost. \n \n \"Furlonger....\" she repeated to herself. \"Furlonger....\" \n \n A sick quake of rage was in her heart. Her feelings were still confused, but definite grievances stood out of the jumble. This man whom she had thought so much of—in school-girl language \"had a rave on\"—had deceived her, told her lies, acted them, and won by them ... well, the horrible thing was that she did not really know how much or how little he had won. \n \n But worse still was the realisation that he had made her do unconsciously something she thought wrong. Like most girls of her age she had a cast-iron code of morals. When a school-girl sets out to be moral, there is no professor of ethics or minister of religion that can touch her—her morality has behind it all the enormous force of inexperience, it can neither stretch nor bend, and it breaks only at the risk of her whole spiritual life. \n \n She was horrified to think she had given her friendship to a scoundrel, even though she had[Pg 124] done it ignorantly. It was like befriending a girl who cheated or told tales. For her his crime had no attraction or interest—it was just a hideous blot and defilement. She had often heard the Wickham Rubber scandal discussed, and now store-housed memories came to appal her. Hundreds of people, most of them already poor, had been ruined and plunged into misery—widows with growing families, elderly spinsters with hard-gathered savings, poor old men with the terror of the workhouse closing on them with age, had trusted this Furlonger once and execrated him now. He was like that dreadful man in the Psalms, who laid wait to murder the innocent—\"he doth ravish the poor when he getteth him into his den.\" And she had allowed this man to be her friend, she had confided her secrets to him, she had dreamed of him and prayed to meet him.... Tony\u0027s teeth and hands clenched, and her eyes grew miserable and hard. \n \n Then she began to wonder what had made Furlonger want her friendship. What had he and she in common? Somehow she could not for a moment believe that he had sought her out from unworthy motives. The fact would always remain that he had wanted her friendship, that he had not given her a word which was not kind or courteous, that he had come to her rescue in her hour of need ... the tears rushed to her eyes; that was the bitterest part of all—her memories of his kindliness and knight-errantry—pictures of East Grinstead, Swites Wood, Brambletye, Lingfield Park, and that little old cottage by Goatsluck Farm. [Pg 125]Suddenly she found herself making up her mind not to join her father and mother in condemning him. She would take his part in the scene which she knew was at hand. \n \n She soon heard her father calling her, and went down. He pointed into her mother\u0027s boudoir, a small room with French windows opening on the lawn. It was full of vague furniture and vague mixed colours, and it seemed to Tony as if she were swimming through it up to the couch where her mother lay. It never struck her as strange that her father should seem unable to deal with her himself, but should hand her over to this weak invalid, who lay with closed eyes in the lamplight. \n \n \"Now, I don\u0027t want a scene,\" she said, without opening them. \n \n \"Tony won\u0027t make a scene,\" said Sir Gambier; \"she\u0027s a deep one.\" \n \n \"Oh, Antoinette,\" sighed Lady Strife—\"I never was so surprised in my life as when I heard of your deceit.\" \n \n \"My deceit!\" said Tony quickly. \n \n \"Yes—going about with a man like Furlonger, and hiding it from your father and mother—don\u0027t you call that deceit?\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t know he was Furlonger.\" \n \n \"But you knew it was wrong to have a secret friendship with any man whatsoever. I never heard of such a thing in a young girl of your age and position—it\u0027s what housemaids do, and not nice housemaids at that.\" \n \n \"Mother,\" cried Tony, her voice shaking unexpectedly, \"it was an adventure.\" \n \n [Pg 126] \n \n \"A what!\" shouted Sir Gambier. \n \n His wife winced. \n \n \"Don\u0027t startle me, dear. And let the child say what she likes—I\u0027m glad she has a theory to explain her actions.\" \n \n Strife muttered something unintelligible, but made no more interruptions. \n \n \"Now tell me, Antoinette,\" said her mother, \"exactly how long you have known this man—and what have you and he been doing together?\" \n \n \"Mother, I can\u0027t explain. I know it sounds deceitful and caddish and all that, but it—it wasn\u0027t. It was an adventure, just as I\u0027ve said. I\u0027ve done something.\" \n \n The invalid smiled distantly. \n \n \"When you are older you will realise the superiority of thought to action. The soul is built of thoughts—actions harden and coarsen it. But we won\u0027t discuss that now. Tell me how you and he got to know each other.\" \n \n \"He was the man who was so splendid at East Grinstead station. He told me his name was Smith, because, of course, he didn\u0027t want me to know who he really was. Then I met him one morning when I was giving Prince a run in Swites Wood, and then another time when I\u0027d punctured my bicycle, and....\" \n \n \"Go on, Antoinette.\" \n \n \"Oh, you\u0027ll never understand. But he was so different from any one else I\u0027d met. He spoke so differently—about such different things——\" \n \n \"I can imagine that.\" \n \n \"But he wasn\u0027t horrid, mother—I swear he[Pg 127] wasn\u0027t. He was very quiet, and interesting, and rather unhappy—and I liked him—I liked him awfully.\" \n \n Lady Strife did not speak, but her eyes were wide open. As for Sir Gambier, an unheard-of thing happened—he became sarcastic. \n \n \"Oh, you liked him, did you? Found him a nice-mannered young fellow?—well-informed? I didn\u0027t know you were interested in the inner life of his Majesty\u0027s prisons.\" \n \n \"Father!\" cried Tony sharply. \n \n \"Now, listen to me, dear,\" said her mother; \"you are very young, and consequently very inexperienced. A grown-up person would at once have realised that this man\u0027s friendship for you could not be disinterested.\" \n \n \"What do you mean?\" \n \n \"I mean that he\u0027s not the type of man who would naturally want to be the friend of a young and innocent girl like you. He must have had some ulterior motive in seeking your friendship. You have possibly seen no signs of that so far, but it would have been plain enough later.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t believe it.\" \n \n \"Hush, dear. Your impertinence disconcerts me. I am trying to view the matter from the standpoint of pure thought, and how am I to do that if you keep on rudely interrupting me and dragging me down into the surge of human annoyance? You must take it from those older and more experienced than yourself that this man\u0027s motives in seeking your friendship could not have been disinterested. Besides, even suppose for the[Pg 128] sake of argument that they were, don\u0027t you think you\u0027ve been acting most disloyally to your father and me in associating with a man you know we disapprove of?\" \n \n \"Mother, I\u0027ve told you I\u0027d no idea who he really was. Why, I thought the other man was Furlonger. Besides, I didn\u0027t know you disapproved of him. When all the others were letting fly at him, you said something about his having a beautiful soul and sinning more divinely than many people pray.\" \n \n There is nothing more irritating to the Magus than to have his early philosophies cast in his teeth by some one with a better memory than his own. Lady Strife descended deep into the surge of human annoyance. \n \n \"Really, Antoinette, you are a perfectly exasperating child. All this comes from trying to treat you like a reasonable being. Your father said that what you really need is a good thrashing, and I\u0027m inclined to agree with him now, though I insisted on having you in, and discussing things with you from the standpoint of pure thought. I shan\u0027t waste any more time on you—you can go back to your room, and stay there till your father gets an answer to his telegram to your Aunt Margaret.\" \n \n \"Aunt Maggie!\" \n \n \"Yes,\" cried Sir Gambier, \"you\u0027re going to Southsea, to stay with your Aunt Maggie till your confounded school re-opens or the crack of doom falls—whichever happens first. You\u0027re too much trouble at home—going about with a face like a[Pg 129] plaster saint, while in reality you\u0027re traipsing over the country with men.\" \n \n \"Father, I wasn\u0027t traipsing. Oh, please don\u0027t send me to Aunt Maggie\u0027s—I shall die.\" This was that terrible coercion from outside which so effectually routs the forces of sixteen. \n \n \"My dear little girl,\" said her mother, who had climbed back to her standpoint of pure thought, \"I know you will be reasonable now, and—I think I may be quite sure of that too—grateful afterwards. Your father and I are really doing you a great kindness in sending you to your aunt\u0027s—here you would never be free from the persecutions of that Furlonger.\" \n \n \"Mother, it wasn\u0027t persecutions. I liked it.\" \n \n \"Antoinette, I shall really begin to think you are utterly silly. To put the matter on its lowest, most materialistic footing, don\u0027t you realise that in associating with a man like that you are seriously damaging your prospects?\" \n \n \"My prospects?\" \n \n \"Yes—your prospects of making a good marriage and doing credit to your family. Come, don\u0027t stare at me so blankly. You must realise that you are now approaching—if not actually arrived at—a marriageable age, and that you must do nothing to damage——\" \n \n \"But, mother, I don\u0027t want ever to marry. Really, I don\u0027t want to talk about such things. It makes me feel—oh, mother, don\u0027t you see it\u0027s bad form?\" \n \n \"What!\" shrieked her mother, with extraordinary lung-power for an invalid. \n \n [Pg 130] \n \n \"We think it bad form at school to talk about marriage.\" \n \n Her parents both stared at her blankly. \n \n \"Well, you can just think it good form to talk about it now,\" said Sir Gambier, feeling for some vague reason that he had said something rather witty. \n \n \"Your school must be an extraordinary place,\" said Lady Strife. \"I shall have to write to the principal—now, don\u0027t interrupt—I shall certainly write; I won\u0027t have such ideas put into your head. You\u0027re quite old enough to think seriously of marriage. Why, I\u0027d already had two offers at your age.\" \n \n Tony looked surprised. She was very fond of her mother, but always wondered how she had ever managed to get married at all, and that she should have had more than one chance seemed positively miraculous. \n \n Lady Strife saw the surprised look, and spoke more sharply. \n \n \"Really, Antoinette, you\u0027re no more than a great baby. You need education in the most ordinary matters. I\u0027ll write to your Aunt Margaret, and ask her to get some eligible men to meet you. Now don\u0027t cry.\" \n \n Tony was actually crying. She was generally as chary and ashamed of tears as a boy. \n \n \"I—I can\u0027t help it. Oh, mother, don\u0027t send me to Aunt Maggie\u0027s. Oh, don\u0027t make her ask el-el-eligible m-men.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t be a blithering idiot!\" shouted Sir [Pg 131]Gambier. \"If you can\u0027t control yourself, go upstairs and begin packing at once.\" \n \n Tony went out, crying into a handkerchief stained with blackberry juice. Her demoralisation was complete. \n \n Awdrey, who had been lurking uneasily in the dining-room, came out as the boudoir door opened and slammed, and for a moment stood horrified at the sight of her sister. \n \n \"Hullo, Tony! Whenever did I last see you cry? What\u0027s the matter, old girl?\" \n \n \"M-Mother thinks I\u0027m old enough to-to b-be married.\" \n \n \"To whom?\" shrieked Awdrey, all agog at once. \n \n \"Nobody—only some el-eligible men at—at Aunt Maggie\u0027s.\" \n \n \"What rot you\u0027re talking. Hasn\u0027t any one asked you?\" \n \n \"Of course not.\" \n \n \"Then what on earth\u0027s all the row about? It\u0027s only natural mother should want you to be married some day.\" \n \n \"But—but I\u0027ve sworn never to marry.\" \n \n \"Ah,\" said Awdrey knowingly, as she tramped upstairs beside her sister; then in a gentler voice, \"Why can\u0027t you marry him?\" \n \n \"Who\u0027s \u0027him\u0027?\" \n \n \"Why, the man who made you swear not to marry.\" \n \n \"It wasn\u0027t a man—it was a g-girl,\" and Tony\u0027s tears burst out afresh, as she remembered how she and Gladys Gates had sworn to each other never to marry, but always to live together, and[Pg 132] had solemnly divided and eaten a lump of sugar in ratification of the covenant. \n \n Awdrey was speechless with disgust, but she went with Tony into her room, because she had not yet found out what she primarily wanted to know. \n \n \"You\u0027re an extraordinary kid, Tony—I really should call you only half there. You kick up all this ridiculous fuss at the mere mention of marriage, and yet you go about with a man like Furlonger. Oh yes, I know all about it. Father was bawling loud enough for every one this side of the Channel to hear.\" \n \n \"But I tell you I didn\u0027t know he was Furlonger. Besides, he didn\u0027t want me to marry him. He wouldn\u0027t dream of suggesting such a thing.\" \n \n \"Oh, no, I\u0027m quite sure of that. But you don\u0027t tell me your relations with him were entirely platonic.\" \n \n \"Yes, I do.\" \n \n \"You mean to say he never even kissed you?\" \n \n \"Kissed me!—of course not!—how dare you, Awdrey!\" \n \n \"My dear child, you play the injured innocence game very well, but when you make out you don\u0027t know what sort of man Furlonger is, you\u0027re carrying it a bit too far.\" \n \n \"Of course, I know he\u0027s been in prison,\" and Tony sobbed drily, \"but as for kissing me, I\u0027m sure he\u0027s not as bad as that.\" \n \n \"Are you trying to be funny?\" asked Awdrey sharply. \n \n [Pg 133] \n \n Tony only sniffed in reply, and her sister\u0027s gaze wandered round the windy, austere room, resting on the few photographs of school-girl friends on the mantelpiece. \n \n \"I suppose you\u0027re in earnest,\" she said, after a pause, \"but really, you\u0027re the weirdest thing, even in flappers, I\u0027ve ever met. Perhaps in time you\u0027ll realise that even such a heinous crime as a kiss is a degree better than robbing a few score poor widows of their savings.\" \n \n Tony stopped crying suddenly, and a quiver passed through her. The expression of her eyes changed. \n \n \"Awdrey—I—I think I\u0027d like to be—alone—to do my packing.\" \n \n Half-an-hour later Tony\u0027s boxes were still empty, except for a foundation layer of the school-girl photographs. The bed and chairs were littered with underclothing, shoes, hats, books and frocks. Tony sat on the floor, staring miserably in front of her with tear-blind eyes that did not notice the surrounding confusion, so intent were they on the litter of a broken dream. Her dream, once so joyful, fresh and iridescent, was now a mere jumble of shards. She had defended Furlonger against her parents and her sister, but it had been the last effort of which her bleeding heart was capable. Her hero and his epic had now broken up into a terrible shatter of disillusion, to which her mother and Awdrey had added the most humiliating dust. She could not think which was worse—the motives of self-interest attributed by the one, or the [Pg 134]love-motives attributed by the other. And though she denied both, at the bottom of her heart was a far worse accusation. Her stainless champion was a criminal, a false swearer, a defrauder of the helpless, a devourer of widows\u0027 houses. He had not sinned against her in the way her family imagined, but in a far more horrible, subtle way ... she shuddered, sickened and shrank. \n \n All the same she was glad that when others accused him she had taken his part. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1936/55531.html","bookId":772,"book":{"id":772,"title":"The Three Furlongers","description":"简介： The twilight was dropping over the fields of three countiesSurrey, Kent and Sussexall touching in the woods round Sparrow Hall.
