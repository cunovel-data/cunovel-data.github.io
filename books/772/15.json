{"id":17821,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV THE SERMON ON FORGIVENESS","content":"Half-an-hour later the three Furlongers sat down to a cold breakfast. They were almost silent, for there was nothing more to be said. The matter was settled. Nigel had found an unexpected ally in Janet, and had carried his point. Directly after breakfast he wrote to von Gleichroeder. It was a difficult letter, for it meant nothing less than eating humble pie, but for that very reason he did not take long over it. An envelope addressed in his large, scrawling hand was soon ready to be posted. It was a clear, cold day, this feast of Stephen. A frosty sunshine crisped the grass, scattering the damps of yesterday\u0027s fog. The lane smelled of frost as Nigel walked up it to the post-office. But he did not see it as it was—in the duress and beggarliness of winter; he saw it as it would be, bursting with spring, full of scent and softness and song. He pictured those naked bushes when spring had clothed them, those grey banks when spring had fired them—the hedges were full of future song, the hollows of primroses to be. He posted his letter, then stood for a moment, looking southward. The sunshine was so clear that the rims of distant windows gleamed with white across the fields. He could see the windows of Shovelstrode.... [Pg 174] Dared he? After all, he would have to. He could not leave Sparrow Hall without seeing Tony. He would not tell her of her place in his plans, but he owed it to her and to himself that she should think of him as a man living uprightly, striving after honour. Now she was thinking of him as a scoundrel and an outcast—he came into her thoughts with a shudder. It must not be. At the same time he was afraid. It gave him a strange, cold qualm to think he was afraid of Tony, once his comrade, now his love—but he was. If he meant to see her, he must go at once, before his resolve lost strength with spontaneity. He turned towards the south, where the sunshine lay. As he came near Shovelstrode his quakings grew. After all, by the time he had made himself worthy to think of her, she would have given herself to another. He could not even hint that he wanted her to wait. He must trust to her aloofness to keep her free, and the memory of their friendship to keep alive in her heart a little spark that he could some day fan into flame. But it was all rather hopeless, a leap in the dark. Perhaps, even, she would refuse to see him. He remembered the look in her eyes when she had turned from him by Goatsluck Farm. All the steel-cold virtue, all the ignorant horror, all the cruelty of youth had been in that look. Perhaps she had turned from him for ever. Perhaps nothing that he could ever achieve or be would wipe out from her memory his foul betrayal of others and herself. [Pg 175] But he went too far in his fears for utter despair. Reaction set in—hope began once more to lacerate him, and whipped him forward to make his last desperate appeal to the fates that had always hitherto been deaf and blind. He hesitated a moment when he came to the house. The servants might know who he was and not allow him in, or he might be seen by some of the family. It struck him that he had better go and look for her in the park before risking himself on the doorstep. She had once told him that she often wandered among the pines. He slipped round behind the lodge, and was skirting the lawn at the back of the house, when he saw one of the French windows open and a girl come out with her dog. His heart gave a suffocating leap, and something seemed to rise in his throat and stay there, making him gulp idiotically. He had never before felt any emotion at the sight of her—just pleasure, a calm, slow-moving comfort. But to-day his head swam, and he could hardly see her as she came running and skipping across the lawn in a manner wholly at variance with her long skirts and coiled-up hair. She turned aside before she reached the bushes that hid him, and he just managed to call after her— \"Tony!—Tony!\" The dog barked, and the next minute had scented him, and came cantering over the grass. Tony stood still and listened. She looked uncertain, and he called again— \"Tony!\" [Pg 176] She turned quickly, and slipped behind the bushes, running to him along the path. When she was a few yards off she stopped dead. \"Mr. Furlonger....\" She stood outlined against a patch of wintry sky. It was the first time that he had seen her since her return. He thought that she was paler than in the valiant days of their friendship, and certainly the way she did her hair gave her a grown-up look. The stifling sensation in his throat became worse, and he could not speak. \"What is it ... Mr. Furlonger?\" \"I—I want to speak to you.\" \"Oh, no! I can\u0027t!\" Her voice was quite childish. \"I must—please do.\" She hesitated a moment. \"Then come into the shrubbery. We can be seen here from the house.\" \"I know. I\u0027m not here to get you into trouble. I—I only came to say good-bye.\" \"Good-bye,\" she repeated vaguely, not quite understanding him, for her heart had said good-bye to him long ago. \"Yes—I\u0027m going to London.\" They were walking away from the house to where the pine-needles were thick under their feet—on a little, moist path smelling of winter. The sunshine came slanting down on Tony as she stopped, showing up her slim, strong figure in a cold purity of light. It rested on her hair, and he saw golden threads in it—in her eyes, and he saw golden sparks in them. For the first time he[Pg 177] realised how beautiful she was in all the assurance and unconsciousness of her youth. He longed to tell her so. Instead he muttered— \"How grown-up you look.\" \"Do I?—it\u0027s my hair, I suppose.\" \"Did they make you put it up?\" \"Aunt Maggie said I was old enough—and I think so too.\" \"I hope you don\u0027t mind my coming here to see you.\" He was desperately embarrassed, and her manner did not reassure him. \"I\u0027m going away, you see, to study music, and I—I thought I should like to say good-bye.\" \"Oh, no,\" she said rather awkwardly, her excessive youth showing nowhere more clearly than in her inability to put him at his ease. \"Oh, no, I\u0027m glad you came—to say good-bye.\" \"I\u0027m going to work very hard. There\u0027s a fellow—Eitel von Gleichroeder, I don\u0027t know if you\u0027ve heard of him—who\u0027s taken a fancy to me, and says he\u0027ll coach me if I\u0027ll take up the violin professionally.\" \"I didn\u0027t know you played.\" \"Yes—but I\u0027d no idea I was any good till I met this chap. He says I ought to make quite a decent thing out of it. I—I think it\u0027s worth trying.\" \"Oh, yes.\" \"You see,\" he continued, his voice shaking with emotion, \"I want to start a new life—to be respectable, I suppose you\u0027d call it. If I win fame as a violinist—and von Gleichroeder thinks I may—I—I shall have lived down everything.\" \"Yes ... of course.\" [Pg 178] It was embarrassment, not lack of interest, that made her replies so trite. Memories of their friendship—now dim and far-off, separated from her by many wonderful happenings—were creeping up to her and filling her with a vague uneasiness. As for Nigel, he realised now what had taken place. He understood why his tongue had suddenly become tied in her presence, and his eagerness collapsed into shuffling uncouthness. He had come to Shovelstrode to speak to a little girl—and he had found a woman. Tony the schoolgirl, the hoyden, the gay comrade, was now nothing but a little ghost haunting the slopes of Ashdown and the secret lanes of Kent. In her place stood a woman—come suddenly, as the woman always comes—and the woman, he knew, was trying to call back the girl, and see things from her eyes once more—and could not. \"Tony—Miss Strife—I wanted to tell you this, just to show you I\u0027m not always going to be a convict on ticket-of-leave.\" \"I\u0027m sure you won\u0027t. I hope you\u0027ll become very famous.\" The words passed her lips in jerks. Her memories of him carried something very like repulsion. The more she struggled to revisualise the comradeship of two months ago, the greater was her distaste and humiliation. The kindest attitude possible for her now was one of embarrassed shyness. At first she had tried to heal herself with her memories, but as soon as she had[Pg 179] worked back to them she found their sweet secrets all sicklied with bitterness and shame. He looked steadfastly at her, and he saw what had happened. \"Tony—you don\u0027t want to know me any longer—you want to forget we ever were friends. There\u0027s no good denying it, for I can see it.\" She stood motionless, her lips white, her hands clenched in front of her. \"It\u0027s true—I can see it,\" he repeated. She did not speak. Her memories were calling very loud, and there were tears in the voices, softening the shame. \"You can\u0027t bear the thought of having once been my friend.\" Tears were rising in her throat, and with her tears the little school-girl who had run away came back, and showed her face again before she went for ever. \"Oh, it\u0027s hurt me!\" she cried. \"You don\u0027t know how it\u0027s hurt me!\" \"To know I was a bad \u0027un?\" He grasped the shaking hand she thrust out before her. \"Yes—I can\u0027t bear to think....\" \"But I\u0027ve changed—I swear I have. I\u0027m going to live a decent life; and you\u0027re going to help me—by just saying you believe I can.\" She shuddered, and pulled her hand away. \"I tell you I\u0027ve changed,\" he exclaimed bitterly; \"won\u0027t you believe me?\" She was crying now. \"You don\u0027t understand ... you don\u0027t [Pg 180]understand ... what one feels about men like you.\" He winced. \"You don\u0027t know what I felt ... when I heard....\" \"Tony!\" he cried, \"you must forgive me.\" \"I do forgive you—it\u0027s not me you\u0027ve hurt—but——\" \"\u0027But\u0027 you don\u0027t forgive me, and it is you I\u0027ve hurt—that\u0027s what your \u0027but\u0027 means.\" There was another silence, broken only by her muffled crying and the throbbing of the wind in the pine-tops. Nigel felt that his old life was struggling in its cerements to spring up and strangle the new life at its birth. \"I can\u0027t understand,\" sobbed the girl, \"how you or any man could have done such a horrible thing. You\u0027ve been merciless and cruel and grasping and unworthy—and you won my friendship by false pretences, by lies and shams—when all the time you knew that if I\u0027d had any idea who you really were I wouldn\u0027t have let you come near me. Oh, it probably seems only a little thing to you, but it\u0027s dreadful for me to think I\u0027ve given my friendship to a man who\u0027s been a—a cad.\" His anger kindled, for her inexperience and ignorance no longer attracted him—they were now only fragments that remained of something he had worshipped. \"Then are you going to inquire into the history of every man you meet, in case any one else should \u0027win your friendship under false pretences\u0027?[Pg 181] Most men have had a little shake up in their pasts.\" \"You don\u0027t call yours a little shake up, do you?\" The retort was obvious, and he flushed—but at the same time it gave him an unwonted courage. \"No, of course not. But you mustn\u0027t think it\u0027s been just as easy for me to keep straight as for you. Do you realise what being a man means?—it means to be tempted.\" \"Women are tempted.\" He laughed. \"But not like men.\" He saw the incredulousness of her eyes, and once more his rage flared up. \"You don\u0027t understand!\" he cried, \"you don\u0027t understand!\" Then it struck him that she would never understand, that she would go through life with her narrow ideas, acquired in a girls\u0027 school and nurtured in her home. All her divine womanly powers of sympathy and forgiveness would be strangled by her ignorance and her hard-and-fast rules based on inexperience. She was the only woman he knew of her class, but he knew the limitations of that class, and Tony would soon be bound by them like the others. Janey was so different—Janey realised what one felt like when one simply had to go on the bust, when one came beastly muckers. She scolded, but she understood. Tony did not scold, and she did not understand. [Pg 182] \"I want you to understand,\" he said painfully. \"What?\" \"About me—about other men.\" \"Why do you think I don\u0027t understand?\" \"You don\u0027t!—you don\u0027t! You simply can\u0027t—and if you go on as you are, you never will. Oh, I wish you could! You\u0027re too good to be like—other women.\" Something in his nervous, excited manner frightened her, and strange to say that faint thrill of fear removed the shame which had tarnished her attitude towards him that day. Once more she felt the subtle magic of his unusualness—the attraction of Mr. Smith. \"Tell me,\" she said in a low voice, \"tell me about yourself.\" He laughed a little. \"Oh, my story is just every man\u0027s. I\u0027ve mucked it a bit worse, that\u0027s all. But the fight\u0027s pretty well as hard with all of us. Directly we\u0027re grown up, almost before, there are people going about whose paid business it is to tempt us. Tempting us, just when Nature has made it most difficult for us to resist, is the profession of thousands of human beings. We fall—we often fall—for if we didn\u0027t a powerful set would have empty pockets—so they see that we fall. And then we can\u0027t pick ourselves up, we sink deeper and deeper into the mud ... and some of us touch bottom.\" He paused, but she did not speak. Her face was turned away. \"The horrible thing I did,\" he continued almost[Pg 183] roughly, \"which, if you\u0027d only believe me, I loathe as much as you do—I did only as the consequence of other things, not quite so bad, before it. If a woman like you had come along when I first fell—I was only nineteen—she might have pulled me up again. But she didn\u0027t come. Other women came, and they knocked me flatter. They couldn\u0027t forgive. Poor devils! I don\u0027t blame them—they\u0027d a great deal to forgive. I went down—and down—till it became a sort of habit to lie there in the ditch. Then you came, and I—I wanted to get up.\" She still looked away from him, but her head was bowed. \"Oh, Tony—won\u0027t you give me a hand?\" \"How can I?\" \"By just believing I can and will do better, and by saying that if I live a decent life, and pull my name out of the dirt, and make myself fit to know you, I may be your—friend. You\u0027ve a right to punish me, but I ask you to put aside that right for—for pity\u0027s sake.\" \"I don\u0027t see why you want my forgiveness so much—why it means such a lot to you.\" \"It means the world to me. Oh, Tony—little pal that was—forgive me! Life\u0027s a hard, rotten, wretched thing, and if there was no one to forgive....\" \"I\u0027ll try.\" \"Oh, please try! If you think, you\u0027ll come to understand things presently, even if you can\u0027t now. It\u0027s for your own sake as well as mine I ask it. Think how many a man who lies in the mud[Pg 184] wouldn\u0027t be there if only he had some woman to forgive him.\" \"I\u0027ll try——\" she repeated falteringly. \"Then I\u0027ve got what\u0027ll keep me going for the present. And, Tony, you\u0027ll believe that I can and will behave decently, and make myself worthy to be your—your friend?\" \"Yes, I\u0027ll believe it.\" \"Thank you.\" She was trembling from head to foot. \"Good-bye,\" he said. \"Good-bye.\" He took her hand, and longed to kiss it. But he was still humble and afraid, and let it fall. \"Tony—Tony—you will have to forgive me a great many things ... because I am so very hungry.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1936/55535.html","bookId":772,"book":{"id":772,"title":"The Three Furlongers","description":"简介： The twilight was dropping over the fields of three countiesSurrey, Kent and Sussexall touching in the woods round Sparrow Hall.
