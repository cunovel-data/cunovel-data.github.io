{"id":108913,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"\"I\u0027m feeling much better,\" Elena told Dr. Meggar. \"I\u0027d like to take a walk around the estate.\" She tried not to bounce up and down on the bed. \"I\u0027ve been eating steak and drinking milk and I even took that vile cod liver oil you sent. Also I have a very firm grasp of reality: I\u0027m here to rescue Stefan and the little boy inside Damon is a metaphor for his unconscious, which the blood we shared allowed me to \u0027see.\u0027\" She bounced once, but covered it by reaching for a glass of water. \"I feel like a happy puppy pulling at the leash.\" She exhibited her newly designed slave bracelets: silver with lapis lazuli inserts in fluid designs. \"If I die suddenly, I am prepared.\"\\n\\n Dr. Meggar\u0027s eyebrows worked up and down. \"Well, I can\u0027t find anything wrong with your pulse or your breathing. I don\u0027t see how a nice afternoon walk can hurt you. Damon\u0027s certainly up and walking. But don\u0027t you go giving Lady Ulma any ideas. She still needs months of bed rest.\"\\n\\n \"She has a nice little desk made from a breakfast tray,\" Bonnie explained, gesturing to show size and width. \"She designs clothes on that.\" Bonnie leaned forward, wide-eyed. \"And you know what? Her dresses are magic.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t expect anything less,\" grunted Dr. Meggar.\\n\\n But the next moment Elena remembered something unpleasant. \"Even when we get the keys,\" she said, \"we have to plot the actual jailbreak.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s a jailbreak?\" Lakshmi asked excitedly.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s like this - we\u0027ve got the keys to Stefan\u0027s cell, but we still need to figure out how we\u0027re going to get into the prison, and how we\u0027re going to smuggle him out.\"\\n\\n Lakshmi frowned. \"Why not just go in with the line and take him out the gate?\"\\n\\n \"Because,\" Elena said, trying for patience, \"they won\u0027t let us just walk in and get him.\" She narrowed her eyes as Lakshmi put her head in her hands. \"What\u0027re you thinking, Lakshmi?\"\\n\\n \"Well, first you say that you\u0027re going to have the key in your hand when you go to the prison, then you act like they\u0027re not going to let him out of the prison.\"\\n\\n Meredith shook her head, bewildered. Bonnie put a hand to her forehead as if it ached. But Elena slowly leaned forward.\\n\\n \"Lakshmi,\" she said, very quietly, \"are you saying that if we have a key to Stefan\u0027s cell it\u0027s basically a pass in and out of prison?\"\\n\\n Lakshmi brightened up. \"Of course!\" she said. \"Otherwise, what would a key be good for? They could just lock him in another cell.\"\\n\\n Elena could hardly believe the wonder of what she had just heard, so she immediately began trying to poke holes in it. \"That would mean we could go straight from Bloddeuwedd\u0027s party to the prison and just take Stefan out,\" she said with as much sarcasm as she could inject into her voice. \"We could just show our key and they\u0027d let us take him away.\"\\n\\n Lakshmi nodded eagerly. \"Yes!\" she said joyfully, the sarcasm having gone right over her head. \"And, don\u0027t be mad, okay? But I wondered why you never went to visit him.\"\\n\\n \"We can visit him?\"\\n\\n \"Sure, if you make an appointment.\"\\n\\n By now Meredith and Bonnie had come to life and were supporting Elena on either side. \"How soon can we send someone to make an appointment?\" Elena said through her teeth, because it was taking all her effort to speak - her entire weight was resting on her two friends. \"Who can we send to make an appointment?\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go,\" Damon said from the crimson darkness behind them. \"I\u0027ll go tonight - give me five minutes.\"\\n\\n Matt could feel that he had on his most cross and stubborn expression.\\n\\n \"C\u0027mon,\" Tyrone said, looking amused. They were both gearing up for a trip into the thicket. This meant putting on two of the mothball-clove-recipe coats each and then using duct tape to fasten the gloves to the coats. Matt was sweating already.\\n\\n But Tyrone was a good guy, he thought. Here Matt had come out of nowhere and said, \"Hey, you know that bizarre thing you saw with poor Jim Bryce last week? Well, it\u0027s all connected to something even more bizarre - all about fox spirits and the Old Wood, and Mrs. Flowers says that if we don\u0027t figure out what\u0027s going on, we\u0027re going to be in real trouble. And Mrs. Flowers isn\u0027t just a batty old lady at the boardinghouse, even though everybody says so.\"\\n\\n \"Of course she isn\u0027t,\" Dr. Alpert\u0027s brusque voice had said from the doorway. She put down her black bag - still a country doctor, even when the town was in crisis - and addressed her son. \"Theophilia Flowers and I have known each other a long time - and Mrs. Saitou, too. They were both always helping people. That\u0027s their nature.\"\\n\\n \"Well - \" Matt had seen an opportunity and jumped at it. \"Mrs. Flowers is the one who needs help now. Really, really needs help.\"\\n\\n \"Then what\u0027re you sitting there for, Tyrone? Hurry up and go help Mrs. Flowers.\" Dr. Alpert had ruffled her own iron-gray hair with her fingers, then ruffled her son\u0027s black hair fondly.\\n\\n \"I was, Mom. We were just leaving when you came in.\"\\n\\n Tyrone, seeing Matt\u0027s grim horror-story of a car, had politely offered to drive them to Mrs. Flowers\u0027s house in his Camry. Matt, afraid of a terminal blowout at some crucial moment, was only too happy to accept.\\n\\n He was glad that Tyrone would be the lynchpin of the Robert E. Lee High football team in the coming year. Ty was the kind of guy you could count on - as witness his immediate offer of help today. He was a good sport, and absolutely straight and clean. Matt couldn\u0027t help but see how drugs and drinking had ruined not only the actual games, but the sportsmanship of the other teams on campus.\\n\\n Tyrone was also a guy who could keep his mouth shut. He hadn\u0027t even peppered Matt with questions as they drove back to the boardinghouse, but he did give a wolf whistle, not at Mrs. Flowers, but at the bright yellow Model T she was driving into the old stables.\\n\\n \"Whoa!\" he said, jumping out to help her with a grocery bag, while his eyes drank in the Model T from fender to fender. \"That\u0027s a Model T Fordor Sedan! This could be one beautiful car if - \" He stopped abruptly and his brown skin burned with a sunset glow.\\n\\n \"Oh, my, don\u0027t be embarrassed about the Yellow Carriage!\" Mrs. Flowers said, allowing Matt to take another bag of groceries back through the kitchen garden and into the kitchen of the house. \"She\u0027s served this family for nearly a hundred years, and she\u0027s accumulated some rust and damage. But she goes almost thirty miles an hour on paved roads!\" Mrs. Flowers added, speaking not only proudly, but with the somewhat awed respect owed to high-speed travel.\\n\\n Matt\u0027s eyes met Tyrone\u0027s and Matt knew there was only one shared thought hanging in the air between them.\\n\\n To restore to perfection the dilapidated, worn, but still beautiful car that spent most of its time in a converted stable.\\n\\n \"We could do it,\" Matt said, feeling that, as Mrs. Flowers\u0027s representative, he should make the offer first.\\n\\n \"We sure could,\" Tyrone said dreamily. \"She\u0027s already in a double garage - no problems about room.\"\\n\\n \"We wouldn\u0027t have to strip her down to the frame...she really rides like a dream.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re kidding! We could clean the engine, though: have a look at the plugs and belts and hoses and stuff. And\" - dark eyes gleaming suddenly - \"my dad has a power sander. We could strip the paint and repaint it the exact same yellow!\"\\n\\n Mrs. Flowers suddenly beamed. \"That was what dear Mama was waiting for you to say, young man,\" she said, and Matt remembered his manners long enough to introduce Tyrone.\\n\\n \"Now, if you had said, \u0027We\u0027ll paint her burgundy\u0027 or \u0027blue\u0027 or any other color, I\u0027m sure she would have objected,\" Mrs. Flowers said as she began to make ham sandwiches, potato salad, and a large kettle of baked beans. Matt watched Tyrone\u0027s reaction to the mention of \"Mama\" and was pleased: there was an instant of surprise, followed by an expression like calm water. His mother had said Mrs. Flowers wasn\u0027t a batty old lady: therefore she wasn\u0027t a batty old lady. A huge weight seemed to roll off Matt\u0027s shoulders. He wasn\u0027t alone with a fragile elderly woman to protect. He had a friend who was actually a little bigger than he was to rely on.\\n\\n \"Now both of you, have a ham sandwich, and I\u0027ll make the potato salad while you\u0027re eating. I know that young men\" - Mrs. Flowers always spoke of men as if they were a special kind of flower - \"need lots of good hearty meat before going into battle, but there\u0027s no reason to be formal. Let\u0027s just dig right in as things are done.\"\\n\\n They had happily obeyed. Now they were preparing for battle, feeling ready to fight tigers, since Mrs. Flowers\u0027s idea of dessert was a pecan pie split between the boys, along with huge cups of coffee that cleared the brain like a power sander.\\n\\n Tyrone and Matt drove Matt\u0027s junker to the cemetery, followed by Mrs. Flowers in the Model T. Matt had seen what the trees could do to cars and he wasn\u0027t going to subject Tyrone\u0027s whistle-clean Camry to the prospect. They walked down the hill to Matt and Sergeant Mossberg\u0027s hide, each of the boys giving a hand to help the frail Mrs. Flowers over rough bits. Once, she tripped and would have fallen, but Tyrone dug the toes of his DC shoes into the hill and stood like a mountain as she tumbled against him.\\n\\n \"Oh, my - thank you, Tyrone dear,\" she murmured and Matt knew that \"Tyrone dear\" had been accepted into the fold.\\n\\n The sky was dark except for one streak of scarlet as they reached the hide. Mrs. Flowers took out the sheriff\u0027s badge, rather clumsily, due to the gardening gloves she was wearing. First she held it to her forehead, then she slowly drew it away, still holding it in front of her at eye-level. \"He stood here and then he bent down and squatted here,\" she said, getting down in what was - in fact - the correct side of the hide. Matt nodded, hardly knowing what he was doing, and Mrs. Flowers said without opening her eyes, \"No coaching, Matt dear. He heard someone behind him - and whirled, drawing his gun. But it was only Matt, and they spoke in whispers for a while.\\n\\n \"Then he suddenly stood up.\" Mrs. Flowers stood suddenly and Matt heard all sorts of alarming little pops and crackles in her delicate old body. \"He went walking - striding - down into that thicket. That evil thicket.\"\\n\\n She set off for the thicket as Sheriff Rich Mossberg had when Matt had watched him. Matt and Tyrone went hurrying after her, ready to stop her if she showed any signs of entering the remnant of Old Wood that still lived.\\n\\n Instead, she walked around it, with the badge held to eye height. Tyrone and Matt nodded at each other and without speaking, each took one of her arms. This way they skirted the edge of the thicket, all the way around, with Matt going first, Mrs. Flowers next, and Tyrone last. At some point Matt realized that tears were making their way down Mrs. Flowers\u0027s withered cheeks.\\n\\n At last, the fragile old woman stopped, took out a lacy handkerchief - after one or two tries - and wiped her eyes with a gasp.\\n\\n \"Did you find him?\" Matt asked, unable to hold in his curiosity any longer.\\n\\n \"Well - we\u0027ll have to see. Kitsune seem to be very, very good at illusions. Everything I saw could have been an illusion. But\" - she heaved a sigh - \"one of us is going to have to step into the Wood.\"\\n\\n Matt gulped. \"That\u0027ll be me, then - \"\\n\\n He was interrupted. \"Hey, no way, man. You know their ops, whatever they are. You\u0027ve got to get Mrs. Flowers out of this - \"\\n\\n \"No, I can\u0027t risk just asking you to come over here and get hurt - \"\\n\\n \"Well, what am I doing out here, then?\" Tyrone demanded.\\n\\n \"Wait, my dears,\" Mrs. Flowers said, sounding as if she were about to cry. The boys shut up immediately, and Matt felt ashamed of himself.\\n\\n \"I know a way that you both can help me, but it\u0027s very dangerous. Dangerous for the two of you. But perhaps if we only have to do it once, we can cut the risk of danger and increase our chance of finding something.\"\\n\\n \"What is it?\" Tyrone and Matt said almost simultaneously.\\n\\n A few minutes later, they were prepped for it. They were lying side by side, facing the wall formed by the tall trees and tangled underbrush of the thicket. They were not only roped together, but they had Mrs. Saitou\u0027s Post-it notes placed all over their arms.\\n\\n \"Now when I say \u0027three\u0027 I want you both to reach in and grab at the ground with your hands. If you feel something, keep hold of it and pull your arm out. If you don\u0027t feel anything, move your hand a little and then pull it out as fast as you can. And by the way,\" she added calmly, \"if you feel anything trying to pull you in or immobilize your arm, yell and fight and kick and scream, and we\u0027ll help you to get out.\"\\n\\n There was a long, long minute of silence.\\n\\n \"So basically, you think there are things all around on the ground in the thicket, and that we might get hold of them just by reaching in blindly,\" Matt said.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Mrs. Flowers said.\\n\\n \"All right,\" said Tyrone, and once again Matt glanced at him approvingly. He hadn\u0027t even asked \"What kind of things could pull us into the Wood?\"\\n\\n Now they were in position and Mrs. Flowers was counting \"One, two, three,\" and then Matt had thrust his right arm in as far as it would go and was sweeping his arm while groping.\\n\\n He heard a shout from beside him. \"Got it!\" And then instantly: \"Something\u0027s pulling me in!\"\\n\\n Matt pulled his own arm out of the thicket before trying to help Tyrone. Something dropped down on it, but it hit a Post-it note and it felt as if he\u0027d been whacked by a piece of a Styrofoam.\\n\\n Tyrone was thrashing wildly and had already been dragged in to his shoulders. Matt grabbed him by the waist and used all his strength to haul backward. There was a moment of resistance - and then Tyrone came popping out as if suddenly released like a cork. There were scratches on his face and neck, but none where the overcoats had covered him or where the Post-it notes were.\\n\\n Matt felt a desire to say \"Thank you,\" but the two women who had made him amulets were far away, and he felt stupid saying it to Tyrone\u0027s coat. In any case, Mrs. Flowers was fluttering and thanking people enough for three.\\n\\n \"Oh, my, Matt, when that big branch came down I thought your arm would be broken - at least. Thank the dear Lord that the Saitou women make such excellent amulets. And, Tyrone dear, please take a swig out of this canteen - \"\\n\\n \"Uh, I don\u0027t really drink much - \"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just hot lemonade, my own recipe, dear. If it weren\u0027t for both you boys, we wouldn\u0027t have succeeded. Tyrone, you found something, yes? And then you were caught and would never have been released if Matt hadn\u0027t been here to save you.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027m sure he\u0027d\u0027ve got out,\" Matt said hurriedly, because it must be embarrassing for anybody like The Tyreminator to admit they needed help.\\n\\n Tyrone, however, just said soberly, \"I know. Thanks, Matt.\"\\n\\n Matt felt himself blush.\\n\\n \"But I didn\u0027t get anything after all,\" Tyrone said disgustedly. \"It felt like a piece of old pipe or something - \"\\n\\n \"Well, let\u0027s have a look,\" Mrs. Flowers said very seriously.\\n\\n She turned the strongest flashlight on the object Tyrone had risked so much to bring out of the thicket.\\n\\n At first Matt thought it was a gigantic rawhide dog bone. But then an all-too-familiar shape made him look closer.\\n\\n It was a femur, a human femur. The biggest bone in the body, the one from the leg. And it was still white. Fresh.\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t seem to be plastic,\" Mrs. Flowers said in a voice that seemed very far away.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t plastic. Matt could see where little tiny bits had curled up and away from the exterior. It wasn\u0027t rawhide, either. It was...well, real. A real human leg bone.\\n\\n But that wasn\u0027t the most horrifying thing; the thing that sent Matt spiraling out into darkness.\\n\\n The bone was polished clean and marked with the imprints of dozens of tiny little teeth.\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-shadow-souls-the-vampire-diaries-2/page-31.html","bookId":2036,"book":{"id":2036,"title":"The Return: Shadow Souls (The Vampire Diaries #2)","description":"Storyline: Shadow Souls (The Vampire Diaries: The Return, #2) \\n Elena Gilbert\u0027s love, the vampire Stefan Salvatore, has been captured and imprisoned by demonic spirits who are wreaking havoc in Fell\u0027s Church.
