{"id":32937,"no":8,"title":"PADDY CORCORAN\u0027S WIFE.","content":"William Carleton. Paddy Corcoran\u0027s wife was for several years afflicted with a kind of complaint which nobody could properly understand. She was sick, and she was not sick; she was well, and she was not well; she was as ladies wish to be who love their lords, and she was not as such ladies wish to be. In fact nobody could tell what the matter with her was. She had a gnawing at the heart which came heavily upon her husband; for, with the help of God, a keener appetite than the same gnawing amounted to could not be [Pg 32] met with of a summer\u0027s day. The poor woman was delicate beyond belief, and had no appetite at all, so she hadn\u0027t, barring a little relish for a mutton-chop, or a \"staik,\" or a bit o\u0027 mait, anyway; for sure, God help her! she hadn\u0027t the laist inclination for the dhry pratie, or the dhrop o\u0027 sour buttermilk along wid it, especially as she was so poorly; and, indeed, for a woman in her condition—for, sick as she was, poor Paddy always was made to believe her in that condition—but God\u0027s will be done! she didn\u0027t care. A pratie an\u0027 a grain o\u0027 salt was a welcome to her—glory be to his name!—as the best roast an\u0027 boiled that ever was dressed; and why not? There was one comfort: she wouldn\u0027t be long wid him—long troublin\u0027 him; it matthered little what she got; but sure she knew herself, that from the gnawin\u0027 at her heart, she could never do good widout the little bit o\u0027 mait now and then; an\u0027, sure, if her own husband begridged it to her, who else had she a better right to expect it from? Well, as we have said, she lay a bedridden invalid for long enough, trying doctors and quacks of all sorts, sexes, and sizes, and all without a farthing\u0027s benefit, until, at the long run, poor Paddy was nearly brought to the last pass, in striving to keep her in \"the bit o\u0027 mait.\" The seventh year was now on the point of closing, when, one harvest day, as she lay bemoaning her hard condition, on her bed beyond the kitchen fire, a little weeshy woman, dressed in a neat red cloak, comes in, and, sitting down by the hearth, says:— \"Well, Kitty Corcoran, you\u0027ve had a long lair of it there on the broad o\u0027 yer back for seven years, an\u0027 you\u0027re jist as far from bein\u0027 cured as ever.\" \"Mavrone, ay,\" said the other; \"in throth that\u0027s what I was this minnit thinkin\u0027 ov, and a sorrowful thought it\u0027s to me.\" \"It\u0027s yer own fau\u0027t, thin,\" says the little woman; \"an\u0027, indeed, for that matter, it\u0027s yer fau\u0027t that ever you wor there at all.\" \"Arra, how is that?\" asked Kitty; \"sure I wouldn\u0027t be [Pg 33] here if I could help it? Do you think it\u0027s a comfort or a pleasure to me to be sick and bedridden?\" \"No,\" said the other, \"I do not; but I\u0027ll tell you the truth: for the last seven years you have been annoying us. I am one o\u0027 the good people; an\u0027 as I have a regard for you, I\u0027m come to let you know the raison why you\u0027ve been sick so long as you are. For all the time you\u0027ve been ill, if you\u0027ll take the thrubble to remimber, your childhre threwn out yer dirty wather afther dusk an\u0027 before sunrise, at the very time we\u0027re passin\u0027 yer door, which we pass twice a-day. Now, if you avoid this, if you throw it out in a different place, an\u0027 at a different time, the complaint you have will lave you: so will the gnawin\u0027 at the heart; an\u0027 you\u0027ll be as well as ever you wor. If you don\u0027t follow this advice, why, remain as you are, an\u0027 all the art o\u0027 man can\u0027t cure you.\" She then bade her good-bye, and disappeared. Kitty, who was glad to be cured on such easy terms, immediately complied with the injunction of the fairy; and the consequence was, that the next day she found herself in as good health as ever she enjoyed during her life. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3253/89111.html","bookId":601,"book":{"id":601,"title":"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry","description":"简介： Yet, be it noticed, if you are a stranger, you will not readily [Pg xi] get ghost and fairy legends, even in a western village.
