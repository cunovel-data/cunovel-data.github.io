{"id":32966,"no":37,"title":"A LEGEND OF TYRONE. ELLEN O\u0027LEARY.","content":"Crouched round a bare hearth in hard, frosty weather, Three lonely helpless weans cling close together; Tangled those gold locks, once bonnie and bright— There\u0027s no one to fondle the baby to-night. \"My mammie I want; oh! my mammie I want!\" The big tears stream down with the low wailing chant. Sweet Eily\u0027s slight arms enfold the gold head: \"Poor weeny Willie, sure mammie is dead— [Pg 133] And daddie is crazy from drinking all day— Come down, holy angels, and take us away!\" Eily and Eddie keep kissing and crying— Outside, the weird winds are sobbing and sighing. All in a moment the children are still, Only a quick coo of gladness from Will. The sheeling no longer seems empty or bare, For, clothed in soft raiment, the mother stands there. They gather around her, they cling to her dress; She rains down soft kisses for each shy caress. Her light, loving touches smooth out tangled locks, And, pressed to her bosom, the baby she rocks. He lies in his cot, there\u0027s a fire on the hearth; To Eily and Eddy \u0027tis heaven on earth, For mother\u0027s deft fingers have been everywhere; She lulls them to rest in the low suggaun [17] chair. They gaze open-eyed, then the eyes gently close, As petals fold into the heart of a rose, But ope soon again in awe, love, but no fear, And fondly they murmur, \"Our mammie is here.\" She lays them down softly, she wraps them around; They lie in sweet slumbers, she starts at a sound, The cock loudly crows, and the spirit\u0027s away— The drunkard steals in at the dawning of day. Again and again, \u0027tween the dark and the dawn, Glides in the dead mother to nurse Willie Bawn: Or is it an angel who sits by the hearth? An angel in heaven, a mother on earth. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3253/89140.html","bookId":601,"book":{"id":601,"title":"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry","description":"简介： Yet, be it noticed, if you are a stranger, you will not readily [Pg xi] get ghost and fairy legends, even in a western village.
