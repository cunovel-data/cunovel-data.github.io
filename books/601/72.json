{"id":33001,"no":72,"title":"THE HAUGHTY PRINCESS. BY PATRICK KENNEDY.","content":"There was once a very worthy king, whose daughter was the greatest beauty that could be seen far or near, but she was as proud as Lucifer, and no king or prince would she agree to marry. Her father was tired out at last, and invited [Pg 291] every king, and prince, and duke, and earl that he knew or didn\u0027t know to come to his court to give her one trial more. They all came, and next day after breakfast they stood in a row in the lawn, and the princess walked along in the front of them to make her choice. One was fat, and says she, \"I won\u0027t have you, Beer-barrel!\" One was tall and thin, and to him she said, \"I won\u0027t have you, Ramrod!\" To a white-faced man she said, \"I won\u0027t have you, Pale Death;\" and to a red-cheeked man she said, \"I won\u0027t have you, Cockscomb!\" She stopped a little before the last of all, for he was a fine man in face and form. She wanted to find some defect in him, but he had nothing remarkable but a ring of brown curling hair under his chin. She admired him a little, and then carried it off with, \"I won\u0027t have you, Whiskers!\" So all went away, and the king was so vexed, he said to her, \"Now to punish your impudence, I\u0027ll give you to the first beggarman or singing sthronshuch that calls;\" and, as sure as the hearth-money, a fellow all over-rags, and hair that came to his shoulders, and a bushy red beard all over his face, came next morning, and began to sing before the parlour window. When the song was over, the hall-door was opened, the singer asked in, the priest brought, and the princess married to Beardy. She roared and she bawled, but her father didn\u0027t mind her. \"There,\" says he to the bridegroom, \"is five guineas for you. Take your wife out of my sight, and never let me lay eyes on you or her again.\" Off he led her, and dismal enough she was. The only thing that gave her relief was the tones of her husband\u0027s voice and his genteel manners. \"Whose wood is this?\" said she, as they were going through one. \"It belongs to the king you called Whiskers yesterday.\" He gave her the same answer about meadows and corn-fields, and at last a fine city. \"Ah, what a fool I was!\" said she to herself. \"He was a fine man, and I might have him for a husband.\" At last they were coming up to a poor cabin. \"Why are you bringing me here?\" says the poor lady. \"This was [Pg 292] my house,\" said he, \"and now it\u0027s yours.\" She began to cry, but she was tired and hungry, and she went in with him. Ovoch! there was neither a table laid out, nor a fire burning, and she was obliged to help her husband to light it, and boil their dinner, and clean up the place after; and next day he made her put on a stuff gown and a cotton handkerchief. When she had her house readied up, and no business to keep her employed, he brought home sallies [willows], peeled them, and showed her how to make baskets. But the hard twigs bruised her delicate fingers, and she began to cry. Well, then he asked her to mend their clothes, but the needle drew blood from her fingers, and she cried again. He couldn\u0027t bear to see her tears, so he bought a creel of earthenware, and sent her to the market to sell them. This was the hardest trial of all, but she looked so handsome and sorrowful, and had such a nice air about her, that all her pans, and jugs, and plates, and dishes were gone before noon, and the only mark of her old pride she showed was a slap she gave a buckeen across the face when he axed her to go in an\u0027 take share of a quart. Well, her husband was so glad, he sent her with another creel the next day; but faith! her luck was after deserting her. A drunken huntsman came up riding, and his beast got in among her ware, and made brishe of every mother\u0027s son of \u0027em. She went home cryin\u0027, and her husband wasn\u0027t at all pleased. \"I see,\" said he, \"you\u0027re not fit for business. Come along, I\u0027ll get you a kitchen-maid\u0027s place in the palace. I know the cook.\" So the poor thing was obliged to stifle her pride once more. She was kept very busy, and the footman and the butler would be very impudent about looking for a kiss, but she let a screech out of her the first attempt was made, and the cook gave the fellow such a lambasting with the besom that he made no second offer. She went home to her husband every night, and she carried broken victuals wrapped in papers in her side pockets. A week after she got service there was great bustle in [Pg 293] the kitchen. The king was going to be married, but no one knew who the bride was to be. Well, in the evening the cook filled the princess\u0027s pockets with cold meat and puddings, and, says she, \"Before you go, let us have a look at the great doings in the big parlour.\" So they came near the door to get a peep, and who should come out but the king himself, as handsome as you please, and no other but King Whiskers himself. \"Your handsome helper must pay for her peeping,\" said he to the cook, \"and dance a jig with me.\" Whether she would or no, he held her hand and brought her into the parlour. The fiddlers struck up, and away went him with her. But they hadn\u0027t danced two steps when the meat and the puddens flew out of her pockets. Every one roared out, and she flew to the door, crying piteously. But she was soon caught by the king, and taken into the back parlour. \"Don\u0027t you know me, my darling?\" said he. \"I\u0027m both King Whiskers, your husband the ballad-singer, and the drunken huntsman. Your father knew me well enough when he gave you to me, and all was to drive your pride out of you.\" Well, she didn\u0027t know how she was with fright, and shame, and joy. Love was uppermost anyhow, for she laid her head on her husband\u0027s breast and cried like a child. The maids-of-honour soon had her away and dressed her as fine as hands and pins could do it; and there were her mother and father, too; and while the company were wondering what end of the handsome girl and the king, he and his queen, who they didn\u0027t know in her fine clothes, and the other king and queen, came in, and such rejoicings and fine doings as there was, none of us will ever see, any way. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3253/89175.html","bookId":601,"book":{"id":601,"title":"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry","description":"简介： Yet, be it noticed, if you are a stranger, you will not readily [Pg xi] get ghost and fairy legends, even in a western village.
