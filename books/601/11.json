{"id":32940,"no":11,"title":"THE FAIRY THORN.","content":"An Ulster Ballad. SIR SAMUEL FERGUSON. \"Get up, our Anna dear, from the weary spinning-wheel; For your father\u0027s on the hill, and your mother is asleep; Come up above the crags, and we\u0027ll dance a highland-reel Around the fairy thorn on the steep.\" At Anna Grace\u0027s door \u0027twas thus the maidens cried, Three merry maidens fair in kirtles of the green; And Anna laid the rock and the weary wheel aside, The fairest of the four, I ween. They\u0027re glancing through the glimmer of the quiet eve, Away in milky wavings of neck and ankle bare; The heavy-sliding stream in its sleepy song they leave, And the crags in the ghostly air: And linking hand in hand, and singing as they go, The maids along the hill-side have ta\u0027en their fearless way, Till they come to where the rowan trees in lonely beauty grow Beside the Fairy Hawthorn grey. [Pg 39] The Hawthorn stands between the ashes tall and slim, Like matron with her twin grand-daughters at her knee; The rowan berries cluster o\u0027er her low head grey and dim In ruddy kisses sweet to see. The merry maidens four have ranged them in a row, Between each lovely couple a stately rowan stem, And away in mazes wavy, like skimming birds they go, Oh, never caroll\u0027d bird like them! But solemn is the silence of the silvery haze That drinks away their voices in echoless repose, And dreamily the evening has still\u0027d the haunted braes, And dreamier the gloaming grows. And sinking one by one, like lark-notes from the sky When the falcon\u0027s shadow saileth across the open shaw, Are hush\u0027d the maiden\u0027s voices, as cowering down they lie In the flutter of their sudden awe. For, from the air above, and the grassy ground beneath, And from the mountain-ashes and the old Whitethorn between, A Power of faint enchantment doth through their beings breathe, And they sink down together on the green. They sink together silent, and stealing side by side, They fling their lovely arms o\u0027er their drooping necks so fair, Then vainly strive again their naked arms to hide, For their shrinking necks again are bare. Thus clasp\u0027d and prostrate all, with their heads together bow\u0027d, Soft o\u0027er their bosom\u0027s beating—the only human sound— They hear the silky footsteps of the silent fairy crowd, Like a river in the air, gliding round. [Pg 40] No scream can any raise, no prayer can any say, But wild, wild, the terror of the speechless three— For they feel fair Anna Grace drawn silently away, By whom they dare not look to see. They feel their tresses twine with her parting locks of gold, And the curls elastic falling as her head withdraws; They feel her sliding arms from their tranced arms unfold, But they may not look to see the cause: For heavy on their senses the faint enchantment lies Through all that night of anguish and perilous amaze; And neither fear nor wonder can ope their quivering eyes, Or their limbs from the cold ground raise, Till out of night the earth has roll\u0027d her dewy side, With every haunted mountain and streamy vale below; When, as the mist dissolves in the yellow morning tide, The maidens\u0027 trance dissolveth so. Then fly the ghastly three as swiftly as they may, And tell their tale of sorrow to anxious friends in vain— They pined away and died within the year and day, And ne\u0027er was Anna Grace seen again.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3253/89114.html","bookId":601,"book":{"id":601,"title":"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry","description":"简介： Yet, be it noticed, if you are a stranger, you will not readily [Pg xi] get ghost and fairy legends, even in a western village.
