{"id":32957,"no":28,"title":"DANIEL O\u0027ROURKE. T. CROFTON CROKER.","content":"People may have heard of the renowned adventures of Daniel O\u0027Rourke, but how few are there who know that the cause of all his perils, above and below, was neither more nor less than his having slept under the walls of the Pooka\u0027s [Pg 98] tower. I knew the man well. He lived at the bottom of Hungry Hill, just at the right-hand side of the road as you go towards Bantry. An old man was he, at the time he told me the story, with grey hair and a red nose; and it was on the 25th of June 1813 that I heard it from his own lips, as he sat smoking his pipe under the old poplar tree, on as fine an evening as ever shone from the sky. I was going to visit the caves in Dursey Island, having spent the morning at Glengariff. \"I am often axed to tell it, sir,\" said he, \"so that this is not the first time. The master\u0027s son, you see, had come from beyond foreign parts in France and Spain, as young gentlemen used to go before Buonaparte or any such was heard of; and sure enough there was a dinner given to all the people on the ground, gentle and simple, high and low, rich and poor. The ould gentlemen were the gentlemen after all, saving your honour\u0027s presence. They\u0027d swear at a body a little, to be sure, and, may be, give one a cut of a whip now and then, but we were no losers by it in the end; and they were so easy and civil, and kept such rattling houses, and thousands of welcomes; and there was no grinding for rent, and there was hardly a tenant on the estate that did not taste of his landlord\u0027s bounty often and often in a year; but now it\u0027s another thing. No matter for that, sir, for I\u0027d better be telling you my story. \"Well, we had everything of the best, and plenty of it; and we ate, and we drank, and we danced, and the young master by the same token danced with Peggy Barry, from the Bohereen—a lovely young couple they were, though they are both low enough now. To make a long story short, I got, as a body may say, the same thing as tipsy almost, for I can\u0027t remember ever at all, no ways, how it was I left the place; only I did leave it, that\u0027s certain. Well, I thought, for all that, in myself, I\u0027d just step to Molly Cronohan\u0027s, the fairy woman, to speak a word about the bracket heifer that was bewitched; and so as I was crossing the stepping-stones of the ford of Ballyashenogh, and was looking up at the stars and blessing myself—for why? it was [Pg 99] Lady-day—I missed my foot, and souse I fell into the water. \u0027Death alive!\u0027 thought I, \u0027I\u0027ll be drowned now!\u0027 However, I began swimming, swimming, swimming away for the dear life, till at last I got ashore, somehow or other, but never the one of me can tell how, upon a dissolute island. \"I wandered and wandered about there, without knowing where I wandered, until at last I got into a big bog. The moon was shining as bright as day, or your fair lady\u0027s eyes, sir (with your pardon for mentioning her), and I looked east and west, and north and south, and every way, and nothing did I see but bog, bog, bog—I could never find out how I got into it; and my heart grew cold with fear, for sure and certain I was that it would be my berrin place. So I sat down upon a stone which, as good luck would have it, was close by me, and I began to scratch my head, and sing the Ullagone—when all of a sudden the moon grew black, and I looked up, and saw something for all the world as if it was moving down between me and it, and I could not tell what it was. Down it came with a pounce, and looked at me full in the face; and what was it but an eagle? as fine a one as ever flew from the kingdom of Kerry. So he looked at me in the face, and says he to me, \u0027Daniel O\u0027Rourke,\u0027 says he, \u0027how do you do?\u0027 \u0027Very well, I thank you, sir,\u0027 says I; \u0027I hope you\u0027re well;\u0027 wondering out of my senses all the time how an eagle came to speak like a Christian. \u0027What brings you here, Dan,\u0027 says he. \u0027Nothing at all, sir,\u0027 says I; \u0027only I wish I was safe home again.\u0027 \u0027Is it out of the island you want to go, Dan?\u0027 says he. \u0027\u0027Tis, sir,\u0027 says I: so I up and told him how I had taken a drop too much, and fell into the water; how I swam to the island; and how I got into the bog and did not know my way out of it. \u0027Dan,\u0027 says he, after a minute\u0027s thought, \u0027though it is very improper for you to get drunk on Lady-day, yet as you are a decent sober man, who \u0027tends mass well, and never fling stones at me or mine, nor cries out after us in the fields—my life for yours,\u0027 says he; \u0027so get up on my back, and grip me well for fear you\u0027d fall off, and I\u0027ll fly you out of the bog.\u0027 \u0027I am afraid,\u0027 says I, \u0027your honour\u0027s making game [Pg 100] of me; for who ever heard of riding a horseback on an eagle before?\u0027 \u0027\u0027Pon the honour of a gentleman,\u0027 says he, putting his right foot on his breast, \u0027I am quite in earnest: and so now either take my offer or starve in the bog—besides, I see that your weight is sinking the stone.\u0027 \"It was true enough as he said, for I found the stone every minute going from under me. I had no choice; so thinks I to myself, faint heart never won fair lady, and this is fair persuadance. \u0027I thank your honour,\u0027 says I, \u0027for the loan of your civility; and I\u0027ll take your kind offer.\u0027 I therefore mounted upon the back of the eagle, and held him tight enough by the throat, and up he flew in the air like a lark. Little I knew the trick he was going to serve me. Up—up—up, God knows how far up he flew. \u0027Why then,\u0027 said I to him—thinking he did not know the right road home—very civilly, because why? I was in his power entirely; \u0027sir,\u0027 says I, \u0027please your honour\u0027s glory, and with humble submission to your better judgment, if you\u0027d fly down a bit, you\u0027re now just over my cabin, and I could be put down there, and many thanks to your worship.\u0027 \"\u0027Arrah, Dan,\u0027 said he, \u0027do you think me a fool? Look down in the next field, and don\u0027t you see two men and a gun? By my word it would be no joke to be shot this way, to oblige a drunken blackguard that I picked up off of a could stone in a bog.\u0027 \u0027Bother you,\u0027 said I to myself, but I did not speak out, for where was the use? Well, sir, up he kept, flying, flying, and I asking him every minute to fly down, and all to no use. \u0027Where in the world are you going, sir?\u0027 says I to him. \u0027Hold your tongue, Dan,\u0027 says he: \u0027mind your own business, and don\u0027t be interfering with the business of other people.\u0027 \u0027Faith, this is my business, I think,\u0027 says I. \u0027Be quiet, Dan,\u0027 says he: so I said no more. \"At last where should we come to, but to the moon itself. Now you can\u0027t see it from this, but there is, or there was in my time, a reaping-hook sticking out of the side of the moon, this way (drawing the figure thus A reaping hook on the ground with the end of his stick). \"\u0027Dan,\u0027 said the eagle, \u0027I\u0027m tired with this long fly; I [Pg 101] had no notion \u0027twas so far.\u0027 \u0027And my lord, sir,\u0027 said I, \u0027who in the world axed you to fly so far—was it I? did not I beg and pray and beseech you to stop half an hour ago?\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s no use talking, Dan,\u0027 said he; \u0027I\u0027m tired bad enough, so you must get off, and sit down on the moon until I rest myself.\u0027 \u0027Is it sit down on the moon?\u0027 said I; \u0027is it upon that little round thing, then? why, then, sure I\u0027d fall off in a minute, and be kilt and spilt, and smashed all to bits; you are a vile deceiver—so you are.\u0027 \u0027Not at all, Dan,\u0027 said he; \u0027you can catch fast hold of the reaping-hook that\u0027s sticking out of the side of the moon, and \u0027twill keep you up.\u0027 \u0027I won\u0027t then,\u0027 said I. \u0027May be not,\u0027 said he, quite quiet. \u0027If you don\u0027t, my man, I shall just give you a shake, and one slap of my wing, and send you down to the ground, where every bone in your body will be smashed as small as a drop of dew on a cabbage-leaf in the morning.\u0027 \u0027Why, then, I\u0027m in a fine way,\u0027 said I to myself, \u0027ever to have come along with the likes of you;\u0027 and so giving him a hearty curse in Irish, for fear he\u0027d know what I said, I got off his back with a heavy heart, took hold of the reaping-hook, and sat down upon the moon, and a mighty cold seat it was, I can tell you that. \"When he had me there fairly landed, he turned about on me, and said, \u0027Good morning to you, Daniel O\u0027Rourke,\u0027 said he; \u0027I think I\u0027ve nicked you fairly now. You robbed my nest last year\u0027 (\u0027twas true enough for him, but how he found it out is hard to say), \u0027and in return you are freely welcome to cool your heels dangling upon the moon like a cockthrow.\u0027 \"\u0027Is that all, and is this the way you leave me, you brute, you,\u0027 says I. \u0027You ugly unnatural baste, and is this the way you serve me at last? Bad luck to yourself, with your hook\u0027d nose, and to all your breed, you blackguard.\u0027 \u0027Twas all to no manner of use; he spread out his great big wings, burst out a laughing, and flew away like lightning. I bawled after him to stop; but I might have called and bawled for ever, without his minding me. Away he went, and I never saw him from that day to this—sorrow fly away with him! You [Pg 102] may be sure I was in a disconsolate condition, and kept roaring out for the bare grief, when all at once a door opened right in the middle of the moon, creaking on its hinges as if it had not been opened for a month before, I suppose they never thought of greasing \u0027em, and out there walks—who do you think, but the man in the moon himself? I knew him by his bush. \"\u0027Good morrow to you, Daniel O\u0027Rourke,\u0027 said he; \u0027how do you do?\u0027 \u0027Very well, thank your honour,\u0027 said I. \u0027I hope your honour\u0027s well.\u0027 \u0027What brought you here, Dan?\u0027 said he. So I told him how I was a little overtaken in liquor at the master\u0027s, and how I was cast on a dissolute island, and how I lost my way in the bog, and how the thief of an eagle promised to fly me out of it, and how, instead of that, he had fled me up to the moon. \"\u0027Dan,\u0027 said the man in the moon, taking a pinch of snuff when I was done, \u0027you must not stay here.\u0027 \u0027Indeed, sir,\u0027 says I, \u0027\u0027tis much against my will I\u0027m here at all; but how am I to go back?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s your business,\u0027 said he; \u0027Dan, mine is to tell you that here you must not stay; so be off in less than no time.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m doing no harm,\u0027 says I, \u0027only holding on hard by the reaping-hook, lest I fall off.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s what you must not do, Dan,\u0027 says he. \u0027Pray, sir,\u0027 says I, \u0027may I ask how many you are in family, that you would not give a poor traveller lodging: I\u0027m sure \u0027tis not so often you\u0027re troubled with strangers coming to see you, for \u0027tis a long way.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m by myself, Dan,\u0027 says he; \u0027but you\u0027d better let go the reaping-hook.\u0027 \u0027Faith, and with your leave,\u0027 says I, \u0027I\u0027ll not let go the grip, and the more you bids me, the more I won\u0027t let go;—so I will.\u0027 \u0027You had better, Dan,\u0027 says he again. \u0027Why, then, my little fellow,\u0027 says I, taking the whole weight of him with my eye from head to foot, \u0027there are two words to that bargain; and I\u0027ll not budge, but you may if you like.\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ll see how that is to be,\u0027 says he; and back he went, giving the door such a great bang after him (for it was plain he was huffed) that I thought the moon and all would fall down with it. \"Well, I was preparing myself to try strength with him, [Pg 103] when back again he comes, with the kitchen cleaver in his hand, and, without saying a word, he gives two bangs to the handle of the reaping-hook that was keeping me up, and whap! it came in two. \u0027Good morning to you, Dan,\u0027 says the spiteful little old blackguard, when he saw me cleanly falling down with a bit of the handle in my hand; \u0027I thank you for your visit, and fair weather after you, Daniel.\u0027 I had not time to make any answer to him, for I was tumbling over and over, and rolling and rolling, at the rate of a fox-hunt. \u0027God help me!\u0027 says I, \u0027but this is a pretty pickle for a decent man to be seen in at this time of night: I am now sold fairly.\u0027 The word was not out of my mouth when, whiz! what should fly by close to my ear but a flock of wild geese, all the way from my own bog of Ballyasheenogh, else how should they know me? The ould gander, who was their general, turning about his head, cried out to me, \u0027Is that you, Dan?\u0027 \u0027The same,\u0027 said I, not a bit daunted now at what he said, for I was by this time used to all kinds of bedevilment, and, besides, I knew him of ould. \u0027Good morrow to you,\u0027 says he, \u0027Daniel O\u0027Rourke; how are you in health this morning?\u0027 \u0027Very well, sir,\u0027 says I, \u0027I thank you kindly,\u0027 drawing my breath, for I was mightily in want of some. \u0027I hope your honour\u0027s the same.\u0027 \u0027I think \u0027tis falling you are, Daniel,\u0027 says he. \u0027You may say that, sir,\u0027 says I. \u0027And where are you going all the way so fast?\u0027 said the gander. So I told him how I had taken the drop, and how I came on the island, and how I lost my way in the bog, and how the thief of an eagle flew me up to the moon, and how the man in the moon turned me out. \u0027Dan,\u0027 said he, \u0027I\u0027ll save you: put out your hand and catch me by the leg, and I\u0027ll fly you home.\u0027 \u0027Sweet is your hand in a pitcher of honey, my jewel,\u0027 says I, though all the time I thought within myself that I don\u0027t much trust you; but there was no help, so I caught the gander by the leg, and away I and the other geese flew after him as fast as hops. \"We flew, and we flew, and we flew, until we came right over the wide ocean. I knew it well, for I saw Cape Clear to my right hand, sticking up out of the water. \u0027Ah, my [Pg 104] lord,\u0027 said I to the goose, for I thought it best to keep a civil tongue in my head any way, \u0027fly to land if you please.\u0027 \u0027It is impossible, you see, Dan,\u0027 said he, \u0027for a while, because you see we are going to Arabia.\u0027 \u0027To Arabia!\u0027 said I; \u0027that\u0027s surely some place in foreign parts, far away. Oh! Mr. Goose: why then, to be sure, I\u0027m a man to be pitied among you.\u0027 \u0027Whist, whist, you fool,\u0027 said he, \u0027hold your tongue; I tell you Arabia is a very decent sort of place, as like West Carbery as one egg is like another, only there is a little more sand there.\u0027 \"Just as we were talking, a ship hove in sight, scudding so beautiful before the wind. \u0027Ah! then, sir,\u0027 said I, \u0027will you drop me on the ship, if you please?\u0027 \u0027We are not fair over it,\u0027 said he; \u0027if I dropped you now you would go splash into the sea.\u0027 \u0027I would not,\u0027 says I; \u0027I know better than that, for it is just clean under us, so let me drop now at once.\u0027 \"\u0027If you must, you must,\u0027 said he; \u0027there, take your own way;\u0027 and he opened his claw, and faith he was right—sure enough I came down plump into the very bottom of the salt sea! Down to the very bottom I went, and I gave myself up then for ever, when a whale walked up to me, scratching himself after his night\u0027s sleep, and looked me full in the face, and never the word did he say, but lifting up his tail, he splashed me all over again with the cold salt water till there wasn\u0027t a dry stitch upon my whole carcass! and I heard somebody saying—\u0027twas a voice I knew, too—\u0027Get up, you drunken brute, off o\u0027 that;\u0027 and with that I woke up, and there was Judy with a tub full of water, which she was splashing all over me—for, rest her soul! though she was a good wife, she never could bear to see me in drink, and had a bitter hand of her own. \"\u0027Get up,\u0027 said she again: \u0027and of all places in the parish would no place sarve your turn to lie down upon but under the ould walls of Carrigapooka? uneasy resting I am sure you had of it.\u0027 And sure enough I had: for I was fairly bothered out of my senses with eagles, and men of the moons, and flying ganders, and whales, driving me [Pg 105] through bogs, and up to the moon, and down to the bottom of the green ocean. If I was in drink ten times over, long would it be before I\u0027d lie down in the same spot again, I know that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3253/89131.html","bookId":601,"book":{"id":601,"title":"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry","description":"简介： Yet, be it noticed, if you are a stranger, you will not readily [Pg xi] get ghost and fairy legends, even in a western village.
