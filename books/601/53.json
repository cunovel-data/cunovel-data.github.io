{"id":32982,"no":53,"title":"RENT-DAY.","content":"\"Oh, ullagone! ullagone! this is a wide world, but what will we do in it, or where will we go?\" muttered Bill Doody, as he sat on a rock by the Lake of Killarney. \"What will we do? To-morrow\u0027s rent-day, and Tim the Driver swears if we don\u0027t pay our rent, he\u0027ll cant every ha\u0027perth we have; and then, sure enough, there\u0027s Judy and myself, and the poor grawls, [43] will be turned out to starve on the high-road, for the never a halfpenny of rent have I!—Oh hone, that ever I should live to see this day!\" Thus did Bill Doody bemoan his hard fate, pouring his sorrows to the reckless waves of the most beautiful of lakes, which seemed to mock his misery as they rejoiced beneath the cloudless sky of a May morning. That lake, glittering in sunshine, sprinkled with fairy isles of rock and verdure, and bounded by giant hills of ever-varying hues, might, with its magic beauty, charm all sadness but despair; for alas, [Pg 204] \"How ill the scene that offers rest And heart that cannot rest agree!\" Yet Bill Doody was not so desolate as he supposed; there was one listening to him he little thought of, and help was at hand from a quarter he could not have expected. \"What\u0027s the matter with you, my poor man?\" said a tall, portly-looking gentleman, at the same time stepping out of a furze-brake. Now Bill was seated on a rock that commanded the view of a large field. Nothing in the field could be concealed from him, except this furze-brake, which grew in a hollow near the margin of the lake. He was, therefore, not a little surprised at the gentleman\u0027s sudden appearance, and began to question whether the personage before him belonged to this world or not. He, however, soon mustered courage sufficient to tell him how his crops had failed, how some bad member had charmed away his butter, and how Tim the Driver threatened to turn him out of the farm if he didn\u0027t pay up every penny of the rent by twelve o\u0027clock next day. \"A sad story, indeed,\" said the stranger; \"but surely, if you represented the case to your landlord\u0027s agent, he won\u0027t have the heart to turn you out.\" \"Heart, your honour; where would an agent get a heart!\" exclaimed Bill. \"I see your honour does not know him; besides, he has an eye on the farm this long time for a fosterer of his own; so I expect no mercy at all at all, only to be turned out.\" \"Take this, my poor fellow, take this,\" said the stranger, pouring a purse full of gold into Bill\u0027s old hat, which in his grief he had flung on the ground. \"Pay the fellow your rent, but I\u0027ll take care it shall do him no good. I remember the time when things went otherwise in this country, when I would have hung up such a fellow in the twinkling of an eye!\" These words were lost upon Bill, who was insensible to everything but the sight of the gold, and before he could unfix his gaze, and lift up his head to pour out his hundred thousand blessings, the stranger was gone. The bewildered [Pg 205] peasant looked around in search of his benefactor, and at last he thought he saw him riding on a white horse a long way off on the lake. \"O\u0027Donoghue, O\u0027Donoghue!\" shouted Bill; \"the good, the blessed O\u0027Donoghue!\" and he ran capering like a madman to show Judy the gold, and to rejoice her heart with the prospect of wealth and happiness. The next day Bill proceeded to the agent\u0027s; not sneakingly, with his hat in his hand, his eyes fixed on the ground, and his knees bending under him; but bold and upright, like a man conscious of his independence. \"Why don\u0027t you take off your hat, fellow? don\u0027t you know you are speaking to a magistrate?\" said the agent. \"I know I\u0027m not speaking to the king, sir,\" said Bill; \"and I never takes off my hat but to them I can respect and love. The Eye that sees all knows I\u0027ve no right either to respect or love an agent!\" \"You scoundrel!\" retorted the man in office, biting his lips with rage at such an unusual and unexpected opposition, \"I\u0027ll teach you how to be insolent again; I have the power, remember.\" \"To the cost of the country, I know you have,\" said Bill, who still remained with his head as firmly covered as if he was the Lord Kingsale himself. \"But, come,\" said the magistrate; \"have you got the money for me? this is rent-day. If there\u0027s one penny of it wanting, or the running gale that\u0027s due, prepare to turn out before night, for you shall not remain another hour in possession. \"There is your rent,\" said Bill, with an unmoved expression of tone and countenance; \"you\u0027d better count it, and give me a receipt in full for the running gale and all.\" The agent gave a look of amazement at the gold; for it was gold—real guineas! and not bits of dirty ragged small notes, that are only fit to light one\u0027s pipe with. However willing the agent may have been to ruin, as he thought, the unfortunate tenant, he took up the gold, and handed the [Pg 206] receipt to Bill, who strutted off with it as proud as a cat of her whiskers. The agent going to his desk shortly after, was confounded at beholding a heap of gingerbread cakes instead of the money he had deposited there. He raved and swore, but all to no purpose; the gold had become gingerbread cakes, just marked like the guineas, with the king\u0027s head; and Bill had the receipt in his pocket; so he saw there was no use in saying anything about the affair, as he would only get laughed at for his pains. From that hour Bill Doody grew rich; all his undertakings prospered; and he often blesses the day that he met with O\u0027Donoghue, the great prince that lives down under the lake of Killarney.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3253/89156.html","bookId":601,"book":{"id":601,"title":"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry","description":"简介： Yet, be it noticed, if you are a stranger, you will not readily [Pg xi] get ghost and fairy legends, even in a western village.
