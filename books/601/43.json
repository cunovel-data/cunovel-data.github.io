{"id":32972,"no":43,"title":"BEWITCHED BUTTER (DONEGAL). MISS LETITIA MACLINTOCK.","content":"Not far from Rathmullen lived, last spring, a family called Hanlon; and in a farm-house, some fields distant, people named Dogherty. Both families had good cows, but the Hanlons were fortunate in possessing a Kerry cow that gave more milk and yellower butter than the others. Grace Dogherty, a young girl, who was more admired than loved in the neighbourhood, took much interest in the Kerry cow, and appeared one night at Mrs. Hanlon\u0027s door with the modest request— \"Will you let me milk your Moiley cow?\" \"An\u0027 why wad you wish to milk wee Moiley, Grace, dear?\" inquired Mrs. Hanlon. \"Oh, just becase you\u0027re sae throng at the present time.\" \"Thank you kindly, Grace, but I\u0027m no too throng to do my ain work. I\u0027ll no trouble you to milk.\" The girl turned away with a discontented air; but the next evening, and the next, found her at the cow-house door with the same request. [Pg 150] At length Mrs. Hanlon, not knowing well how to persist in her refusal, yielded, and permitted Grace to milk the Kerry cow. She soon had reason to regret her want of firmness. Moiley gave no more milk to her owner. When this melancholy state of things lasted for three days, the Hanlons applied to a certain Mark McCarrion, who lived near Binion. \"That cow has been milked by someone with an evil eye,\" said he. \"Will she give you a wee drop, do you think? The full of a pint measure wad do.\" \"Oh, ay, Mark, dear; I\u0027ll get that much milk frae her, any way.\" \"Weel, Mrs. Hanlon, lock the door, an\u0027 get nine new pins that was never used in clothes, an\u0027 put them into a saucepan wi\u0027 the pint o\u0027 milk. Set them on the fire, an\u0027 let them come to the boil.\" The nine pins soon began to simmer in Moiley\u0027s [19] milk. Rapid steps were heard approaching the door, agitated knocks followed, and Grace Dogherty\u0027s high-toned voice was raised in eager entreaty. \"Let me in, Mrs. Hanlon!\" she cried. \"Tak off that cruel pot! Tak out them pins, for they\u0027re pricking holes in my heart, an\u0027 I\u0027ll never offer to touch milk of yours again.\" [There is hardly a village in Ireland where the milk is not thus believed to have been stolen times upon times. There are many counter-charms. Sometimes the coulter of a plough will be heated red-hot, and the witch will rush in, crying out that she is burning. A new horse-shoe or donkey-shoe, heated and put under the churn, with three straws, if possible, stolen at midnight from over the witches\u0027 door, is quite infallible.—Ed.]","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3253/89146.html","bookId":601,"book":{"id":601,"title":"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry","description":"简介： Yet, be it noticed, if you are a stranger, you will not readily [Pg xi] get ghost and fairy legends, even in a western village.
