WILLIAM ALLINGHAM.","content":"I heard the dogs howl in the moonlight night; I went to the window to see the sight; All the Dead that ever I knew Going one by one and two by two. On they pass\u0027d, and on they pass\u0027d; Townsfellows all, from first to last; Born in the moonlight of the lane, Quench\u0027d in the heavy shadow again. Schoolmates, marching as when we play\u0027d At soldiers once—but now more staid; Those were the strangest sight to me Who were drown\u0027d, I knew, in the awful sea. [Pg 130] Straight and handsome folk; bent and weak, too; Some that I loved, and gasp\u0027d to speak to; Some but a day in their churchyard bed; Some that I had not known were dead. A long, long crowd—where each seem\u0027d lonely, Yet of them all there was one, one only, Raised a head or look\u0027d my way. She linger\u0027d a moment,—she might not stay. How long since I saw that fair pale face! Ah! Mother dear! might I only place My head on thy breast, a moment to rest, While thy hand on my tearful cheek were prest! On, on, a moving bridge they made Across the moon-stream, from shade to shade, Young and old, women and men; Many long-forgot, but remember\u0027d then. And first there came a bitter laughter; A sound of tears the moment after; And then a music so lofty and gay, That every morning, day by day, I strive to recall it if I may. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3253/89138.html","bookId":601,"book":{"id":601,"title":"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry","description":"简介： Yet, be it noticed, if you are a stranger, you will not readily [Pg xi] get ghost and fairy legends, even in a western village.
