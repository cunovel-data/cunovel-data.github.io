[This song is supposed to have been sung by a young bride, who was forcibly detained in one of those forts which are so common in Ireland, and to which the good people are very fond of resorting. Under pretence of hushing her child to rest, she retired to the outside margin of the fort, and addressed the burthen of her song to a young woman whom she saw at a short distance, and whom she requested to inform her husband of her condition, and to desire him to bring the steel knife to dissolve the enchantment.] [Pg 34] Sleep, my child! for the rustling trees, Stirr\u0027d by the breath of summer breeze, And fairy songs of sweetest note, Around us gently float. Sleep! for the weeping flowers have shed Their fragrant tears upon thy head, The voice of love hath sooth\u0027d thy rest, And thy pillow is a mother\u0027s breast. Sleep, my child! Weary hath pass\u0027d the time forlorn, Since to your mansion I was borne, Tho\u0027 bright the feast of its airy halls, And the voice of mirth resounds from its walls. Sleep, my child! Full many a maid and blooming bride Within that splendid dome abide,— And many a hoar and shrivell\u0027d sage, And many a matron bow\u0027d with age. Sleep, my child! Oh! thou who hearest this song of fear, To the mourner\u0027s home these tidings bear. Bid him bring the knife of the magic blade, At whose lightning-flash the charm will fade. Sleep, my child! Haste! for to-morrow\u0027s sun will see The hateful spell renewed for me; Nor can I from that home depart, Till life shall leave my withering heart. Sleep, my child! Sleep, my child! for the rustling trees, Stirr\u0027d by the breath of summer breeze, And fairy songs of sweetest note, Around us gently float. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3253/89112.html","bookId":601,"book":{"id":601,"title":"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry","description":"简介： Yet, be it noticed, if you are a stranger, you will not readily [Pg xi] get ghost and fairy legends, even in a western village.
