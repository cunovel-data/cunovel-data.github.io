LOVER.","content":"\"By Gor, I thought all the world, far and near, heerd o\u0027 King O\u0027Toole—well, well, but the darkness of mankind is ontellible! Well, sir, you must know, as you didn\u0027t hear it afore, that there was a king, called King O\u0027Toole, who was [Pg 225] a fine ould king in the ould ancient times, long ago; and it was him that owned the churches in the early days. The king, you see, was the right sort; he was the rale boy, and loved sport as he loved his life, and huntin\u0027 in partic\u0027lar; and from the risin\u0027 o\u0027 the sun, up he got, and away he wint over the mountains beyant afther the deer; and the fine times them wor. \"Well, it was all mighty good, as long as the king had his health; but, you see, in coorse of time the king grew ould, by raison he was stiff in his limbs, and when he got sthriken in years, his heart failed him, and he was lost intirely for want o\u0027 divarshin, bekase he couldn\u0027t go a huntin\u0027 no longer; and, by dad, the poor king was obleeged at last for to get a goose to divart him. Oh, you may laugh, if you like, but it\u0027s truth I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you; and the way the goose divarted him was this-a-way: You see, the goose used for to swim acrass the lake, and go divin\u0027 for throut, and cotch fish on a Friday for the king, and flew every other day round about the lake, divartin\u0027 the poor king. All went on mighty well, antil, by dad, the goose got sthriken in years like her master, and couldn\u0027t divart him no longer, and then it was that the poor king was lost complate. The king was walkin\u0027 one mornin\u0027 by the edge of the lake, lamentin\u0027 his cruel fate, and thinkin\u0027 o\u0027 drownin\u0027 himself, that could get no divarshun in life, when all of a suddint, turnin\u0027 round the corner beyant, who should he meet but a mighty dacent young man comin\u0027 up to him. \"\u0027God save you,\u0027 says the king to the young man. \"\u0027God save you kindly, King O\u0027Toole,\u0027 says the young man. \u0027Thrue for you,\u0027 says the king. \u0027I am King O\u0027Toole,\u0027 says he, \u0027prince and plennypennytinchery o\u0027 these parts,\u0027 says he; \u0027but how kem ye to know that?\u0027 says he. \u0027Oh, never mind,\u0027 says St. Kavin. \"You see it was Saint Kavin, sure enough—the saint himself in disguise, and nobody else. \u0027Oh, never mind,\u0027 says he, \u0027I know more than that. May I make bowld to ax how is your goose, King O\u0027Toole?\u0027 says he. \u0027Blur-an-agers, how kem ye to know about my goose?\u0027 says [Pg 226] the king. \u0027Oh, no matther; I was given to understand it,\u0027 says Saint Kavin. After some more talk the king says, \u0027What are you?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m an honest man,\u0027 says Saint Kavin. \u0027Well, honest man,\u0027 says the king, \u0027and how is it you make your money so aisy?\u0027 \u0027By makin\u0027 ould things as good as new,\u0027 says Saint Kavin. \u0027Is it a tinker you are?\u0027 says the king. \u0027No,\u0027 says the saint; \u0027I\u0027m no tinker by thrade, King O\u0027Toole; I\u0027ve a betther thrade than a tinker,\u0027 says he—\u0027what would you say,\u0027 says he, \u0027if I made your ould goose as good as new?\u0027 \"My dear, at the word o\u0027 making his goose as good as new, you\u0027d think the poor ould king\u0027s eyes was ready to jump out iv his head. With that the king whistled, and down kem the poor goose, all as one as a hound, waddlin\u0027 up to the poor cripple, her masther, and as like him as two pays.
