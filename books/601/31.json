{"id":32960,"no":31,"title":"HOW THOMAS CONNOLLY MET THE BANSHEE. J. TODHUNTER.","content":"Aw, the banshee, sir? Well, sir, as I was striving to tell ye, I was going home from work one day, from Mr. Cassidy\u0027s that I tould ye of, in the dusk o\u0027 the evening. I had more [Pg 109] nor a mile—aye, it was nearer two mile—to thrack to, where I was lodgin\u0027 with a dacent widdy woman I knew, Biddy Maguire be name, so as to be near me work. It was the first week in November, an\u0027 a lonesome road I had to travel, an\u0027 dark enough, wid threes above it; an\u0027 about half-ways there was a bit of a brudge I had to cross, over one o\u0027 them little sthrames that runs into the Doddher. I walked on in the middle iv the road, for there was no toe-path at that time, Misther Harry, nor for many a long day afther that; but, as I was sayin\u0027, I walked along till I come nigh upon the brudge, where the road was a bit open, an\u0027 there, right enough, I seen the hog\u0027s back o\u0027 the ould-fashioned brudge that used to be there till it was pulled down, an\u0027 a white mist steamin\u0027 up out o\u0027 the wather all around it. Well, now, Misther Harry, often as I\u0027d passed by the place before, that night it seemed sthrange to me, an\u0027 like a place ye might see in a dhrame; an\u0027 as I come up to it I began to feel a could wind blowin\u0027 through the hollow o\u0027 me heart. \"Musha Thomas,\" sez I to meself, \"is it yerself that\u0027s in it?\" sez I; \"or, if it is, what\u0027s the matter wid ye at all, at all?\" sez I; so I put a bould face on it, an\u0027 I made a sthruggle to set one leg afore the other, ontil I came to the rise o\u0027 the brudge. And there, God be good to us! in a cantle o\u0027 the wall I seen an ould woman, as I thought, sittin\u0027 on her hunkers, all crouched together, an\u0027 her head bowed down, seemin\u0027ly in the greatest affliction. Well, sir, I pitied the ould craythur, an\u0027 thought I wasn\u0027t worth a thraneen, for the mortial fright I was in, I up an\u0027 sez to her, \"That\u0027s a cowld lodgin\u0027 for ye, ma\u0027am.\" Well, the sorra ha\u0027porth she sez to that, nor tuk no more notice o\u0027 me than if I hadn\u0027t let a word out o\u0027 me, but kep\u0027 rockin\u0027 herself to an\u0027 fro, as if her heart was breakin\u0027; so I sez to her again, \"Eh, ma\u0027am, is there anythin\u0027 the matther wid ye?\" An\u0027 I made for to touch her on the shouldher, on\u0027y somethin\u0027 stopt me, for as I looked closer at her I saw she was no more an ould woman nor she was an ould cat. The first thing I tuk notice to, Misther Harry, was her hair, that [Pg 110] was sthreelin\u0027 down over his showldhers, an\u0027 a good yard on the ground on aich side of her. O, be the hoky farmer, but that was the hair! The likes of it I never seen on mortial woman, young or ould, before nor sense. It grew as sthrong out of her as out of e\u0027er a young slip of a girl ye could see; but the colour of it was a misthery to describe. The first squint I got of it I thought it was silvery grey, like an ould crone\u0027s; but when I got up beside her I saw, be the glance o\u0027 the sky, it was a soart iv an Iscariot colour, an\u0027 a shine out of it like floss silk. It ran over her showldhers and the two shapely arms she was lanin\u0027 her head on, for all the world like Mary Magdalen\u0027s in a picther; and then I persaved that the grey cloak and the green gownd undhernaith it was made of no earthly matarial I ever laid eyes on. Now, I needn\u0027t tell ye, sir, that I seen all this in the twinkle of a bed-post—long as I take to make the narration of it. So I made a step back from her, an\u0027 \"The Lord be betune us an\u0027 harm!\" sez I, out loud, an\u0027 wid that I blessed meself. Well, Misther Harry, the word wasn\u0027t out o\u0027 me mouth afore she turned her face on me. Aw, Misther Harry, but \u0027twas that was the awfullest apparation ever I seen, the face of her as she looked up at me! God forgive me for sayin\u0027 it, but \u0027twas more like the face of the \"Axy Homo\" beyand in Marlboro\u0027 Sthreet Chapel nor like any face I could mintion—as pale as a corpse, an\u0027 a most o\u0027 freckles on it, like the freckles on a turkey\u0027s egg; an\u0027 the two eyes sewn in wid red thread, from the terrible power o\u0027 crying the\u0027 had to do; an\u0027 such a pair iv eyes as the\u0027 wor, Misther Harry, as blue as two forget-me-nots, an\u0027 as cowld as the moon in a bog-hole of a frosty night, an\u0027 a dead-an\u0027-live look in them that sent a cowld shiver through the marra o\u0027 me bones. Be the mortial! ye could ha\u0027 rung a tay cupful o\u0027 cowld paspiration out o\u0027 the hair o\u0027 me head that minute, so ye could. Well, I thought the life \u0027ud lave me intirely when she riz up from her hunkers, till, bedad! she looked mostly as tall as Nelson\u0027s Pillar; an\u0027 wid the two eyes gazin\u0027 back at me, an\u0027 her two arms stretched out before hor, an\u0027 a keine out of her that riz the hair o\u0027 me [Pg 111] scalp till it was as stiff as the hog\u0027s bristles in a new hearth broom, away she glides—glides round the angle o\u0027 the brudge, an\u0027 down with her into the sthrame that ran undhernaith it. \u0027Twas then I began to suspect what she was. \"Wisha, Thomas!\" says I to meself, sez I; an\u0027 I made a great struggle to get me two legs into a throt, in spite o\u0027 the spavin o\u0027 fright the pair o\u0027 them wor in; an\u0027 how I brought meself home that same night the Lord in heaven only knows, for I never could tell; but I must ha\u0027 tumbled agin the door, and shot in head foremost into the middle o\u0027 the flure, where I lay in a dead swoon for mostly an hour; and the first I knew was Mrs. Maguire stannin\u0027 over me with a jorum o\u0027 punch she was pourin\u0027 down me throath (throat), to bring back the life into me, an\u0027 me head in a pool of cowld wather she dashed over me in her first fright. \"Arrah, Mister Connolly,\" shashee, \"what ails ye?\" shashee, \"to put the scare on a lone woman like that?\" shashee. \"Am I in this world or the next?\" sez I. \"Musha! where else would ye be on\u0027y here in my kitchen?\" shashee. \"O, glory be to God!\" sez I, \"but I thought I was in Purgathory at the laste, not to mintion an uglier place,\" sez I, \"only it\u0027s too cowld I find meself, an\u0027 not too hot,\" sez I. \"Faix, an\u0027 maybe ye wor more nor half-ways there, on\u0027y for me,\" shashee; \"but what\u0027s come to you at all, at all? Is it your fetch ye seen, Mister Connolly?\" \"Aw, naboclish!\" [15] sez I. \"Never mind what I seen,\" sez I. So be degrees I began to come to a little; an\u0027 that\u0027s the way I met the banshee, Misther Harry! \"But how did you know it really was the banshee after all, Thomas?\" \"Begor, sir, I knew the apparation of her well enough; but \u0027twas confirmed by a sarcumstance that occurred the same time. There was a Misther O\u0027Nales was come on a visit, ye must know, to a place in the neighbourhood—one o\u0027 the ould O\u0027Nales iv the county Tyrone, a rale ould Irish family—an\u0027 the banshee was heard keening round the house that same night, be more then one that was in it; [Pg 112] an\u0027 sure enough, Misther Harry, he was found dead in his bed the next mornin\u0027. So if it wasn\u0027t the banshee I seen that time, I\u0027d like to know what else it could a\u0027 been.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3253/89134.html","bookId":601,"book":{"id":601,"title":"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry","description":"简介： Yet, be it noticed, if you are a stranger, you will not readily [Pg xi] get ghost and fairy legends, even in a western village.
