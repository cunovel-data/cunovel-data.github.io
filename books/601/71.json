{"id":33000,"no":71,"title":"THE LAZY BEAUTY AND HER AUNTS.","content":"PATRICK KENNEDY\u0027S \"FIRESIDE STORIES OF IRELAND.\" There was once a poor widow woman, who had a daughter that was as handsome as the day, and as lazy as a pig, saving your presence. The poor mother was the most industrious person in the townland, and was a particularly good hand at the spinning-wheel. It was the wish of her heart that her daughter should be as handy as herself; but she\u0027d get up late, eat her breakfast before she\u0027d finish her prayers, and then go about dawdling, and anything she handled seemed to be burning her fingers. She drawled her words as if it was a great trouble to her to speak, or as if her tongue was as lazy as her body. Many a heart-scald her poor mother got with her, and still she was only improving like dead fowl in August. Well, one morning that things were as bad as they could be, and the poor woman was giving tongue at the rate of a mill-clapper, who should be riding by but the king\u0027s son. \"Oh dear, oh dear, good woman!\" said he, \"you must have a very bad child to make you scold so terribly. Sure it can\u0027t be this handsome girl that vexed you!\" \"Oh, please your Majesty, not at all,\" says the old dissembler. \"I was only checking her for working herself too much. Would your majesty believe it? She spins three pounds of flax in a day, weaves it into linen the next, and makes it all into shirts the day after.\" \"My gracious,\" says the prince, \"she\u0027s the very lady that will just fill my mother\u0027s eye, and herself\u0027s the greatest spinner in the kingdom. Will you put [Pg 287] on your daughter\u0027s bonnet and cloak, if you please, ma\u0027am, and set her behind me? Why, my mother will be so delighted with her, that perhaps she\u0027ll make her her daughter-in-law in a week, that is, if the young woman herself is agreeable.\" Well, between the confusion, and the joy, and the fear of being found out, the women didn\u0027t know what to do; and before they could make up their minds, young Anty (Anastasia) was set behind the prince, and away he and his attendants went, and a good heavy purse was left behind with the mother. She pullillued a long time after all was gone, in dread of something bad happening to the poor girl. The prince couldn\u0027t judge of the girl\u0027s breeding or wit from the few answers he pulled out of her. The queen was struck in a heap when she saw a young country girl sitting behind her son, but when she saw her handsome face, and heard all she could do, she didn\u0027t think she could make too much of her. The prince took an opportunity of whispering her that if she didn\u0027t object to be his wife she must strive to please his mother. Well, the evening went by, and the prince and Anty were getting fonder and fonder of one another, but the thought of the spinning used toe send the cold to her heart every moment. When bed-time came, the old queen went along with her to a beautiful bedroom, and when she was bidding her good-night, she pointed to a heap of fine flax, and said, \"You may begin as soon as you like to-morrow morning, and I\u0027ll expect to see these three pounds in nice thread the morning after.\" Little did the poor girl sleep that night. She kept crying and lamenting that she didn\u0027t mind her mother\u0027s advice better. When she was left alone next morning, she began with a heavy heart; and though she had a nice mahogany wheel and the finest flax you ever saw, the thread was breaking every moment. One while it was as fine as a cobweb, and the next as coarse as a little boy\u0027s whipcord. At last she pushed her chair back, let her hands fall in her lap, and burst out a-crying. [Pg 288] A small, old woman with surprising big feet appeared before her at the same moment, and said, \"What ails you, you handsome colleen?\" \"An\u0027 haven\u0027t I all that flax to spin before to-morrow morning, and I\u0027ll never be able to have even five yards of fine thread of it put together.\" \"An\u0027 would you think bad to ask poor Colliagh Cushmōr (Old woman Big-foot) to your wedding with the young prince? If you promise me that, all your three pounds will be made into the finest of thread while you\u0027re taking your sleep to-night.\" \"Indeed, you must be there and welcome, and I\u0027ll honour you all the days of your life.\" \"Very well; stay in your room till tea-time, and tell the queen she may come in for her thread as early as she likes to-morrow morning.\" It was all as she said; and the thread was finer and evener than the gut you see with fly-fishers. \"My brave girl you were!\" says the queen. \"I\u0027ll get my own mahogany loom brought into you, but you needn\u0027t do anything more to-day. Work and rest, work and rest, is my motto. To-morrow you\u0027ll weave all this thread, and who knows what may happen?\" The poor girl was more frightened this time than the last, and she was so afraid to lose the prince. She didn\u0027t even know how to put the warp in the gears, nor how to use the shuttle, and she was sitting in the greatest grief, when a little woman, who was mighty well-shouldered about the hips, all at once appeared to her, told her her name was Colliach Cromanmōr, and made the same bargain with her as Colliach Cushmōr. Great was the queen\u0027s pleasure when she found early in the morning a web as fine and white as the finest paper you ever saw. \"The darling you were!\" says she. \"Take your ease with the ladies and gentlemen to-day, and if your have all this made into nice shirts to-morrow you may present one of them to my son, and be married to him out of hand.\" Oh, wouldn\u0027t you pity poor Anty the next day, she was now so near the prince, and, maybe, would be soon so far from him. But she waited as patiently as she could with scissors, needle, and thread in hand, till a minute after noon. [Pg 289] Then she was rejoiced to see the third old woman appear. She had a big red nose, and informed Anty that people called her Shron Mor Rua on that account. She was up to her as good as the others, for a dozen fine shirts were lying on the table when the queen paid her an early visit. Now there was nothing talked of but the wedding, and I needn\u0027t tell you it was grand. The poor mother was there along with the rest, and at the dinner the old queen could talk of nothing but the lovely shirts, and how happy herself and the bride would be after the honeymoon, spinning, and weaving, and sewing shirts and shifts without end. The bridegroom didn\u0027t like the discourse, and the bride liked it less, and he was going to say something, when the footman came up to the head of the table and said to the bride, \"Your ladyship\u0027s aunt, Colliach Cushmōr, bade me ask might she come in.\" The bride blushed and wished she was seven miles under the floor, but well became the prince. \"Tell Mrs. Cushmōr,\" said he, \"that any relation of my bride\u0027s will be always heartily welcome wherever she and I are.\" In came the woman with the big foot, and got a seat near the prince. The old queen didn\u0027t like it much, and after a few words she asked rather spitefully, \"Dear ma\u0027am, what\u0027s the reason your foot is so big?\" \"Musha, faith, your majesty, I was standing almost all my life at the spinning-wheel, and that\u0027s the reason.\" \"I declare to you, my darling,\" said the prince, \"I\u0027ll never allow you to spend one hour at the same spinning-wheel.\" The same footman said again, \"Your ladyship\u0027s aunt, Colliach Cromanmōr, wishes to come in, if the genteels and yourself have no objection.\" Very sharoose (displeased) was Princess Anty, but the prince sent her welcome, and she took her seat, and drank healths apiece to the company. \"May I ask, ma\u0027am?\" says the old queen, \"why you\u0027re so wide half-way between the head and the feet?\" \"That, your majesty, is owing to sitting all my life at the loom.\" \"By my sceptre,\" says the prince, \"my wife shall never sit there an hour.\" The footman again came up. \"Your ladyship\u0027s aunt, Colliach Shron Mor Rua, is asking leave to [Pg 290] come into the banquet.\" More blushing on the bride\u0027s face, but the bridegroom spoke out cordially, \"Tell Mrs. Shron Mor Rua she\u0027s doing us an honour.\" In came the old woman, and great respect she got near the top of the table, but the people down low put up their tumblers and glasses to their noses to hide the grins. \"Ma\u0027am,\" says the old queen, \"will you tell us, if you please, why your nose is so big and red?\" \"Throth, your majesty, my head was bent down over the stitching all my life, and all the blood in my body ran into my nose.\" \"My darling,\" said the prince to Anty, \"if ever I see a needle in your hand, I\u0027ll run a hundred miles from you.\" \"And in troth, girls and boys, though it\u0027s a diverting story, I don\u0027t think the moral is good; and if any of you thuckeens go about imitating Anty in her laziness, you\u0027ll find it won\u0027t thrive with you as it did with her. She was beautiful beyond compare, which none of you are, and she had three powerful fairies to help her besides. There\u0027s no fairies now, and no prince or lord to ride by, and catch you idling or working; and maybe, after all, the prince and herself were not so very happy when the cares of the world or old age came on them.\" Thus was the tale ended by poor old Shebale (Sybilla), Father Murphy\u0027s housekeeper, in Coolbawn, Barony of Bantry, about half a century since. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3253/89174.html","bookId":601,"book":{"id":601,"title":"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry","description":"简介： Yet, be it noticed, if you are a stranger, you will not readily [Pg xi] get ghost and fairy legends, even in a western village.
