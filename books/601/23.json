Only the plaintive yellow bird [11] Sighing in sultry fields around, Chary, chary, chary, chee-ee!— Only the grasshopper and the bee?—[Pg 82] \"Tip tap, rip-rap, Tick-a-tack-too! Scarlet leather, sewn together, This will make a shoe. Left, right, pull it tight; Summer days are warm; Underground in winter, Laughing at the storm!\" Lay your ear close to the hill. Do you not catch the tiny clamour, Busy click of an elfin hammer, Voice of the Lepracaun singing shrill As he merrily plies his trade? He\u0027s a span And a quarter in height. Get him in sight, hold him tight, And you\u0027re a made Man! II. You watch your cattle the summer day, Sup on potatoes, sleep in the hay; How would you like to roll in your carriage, Look for a duchess\u0027s daughter in marriage? Seize the Shoemaker—then you may! \"Big boots a-hunting, Sandals in the hall, White for a wedding-feast, Pink for a ball. This way, that way, So we make a shoe; Getting rich every stitch, Tick-tack-too!\" Nine-and-ninety treasure-crocks This keen miser-fairy hath, Hid in mountains, woods, and rocks, Ruin and round-tow\u0027r, cave and rath, And where the cormorants build;[Pg 83] From times of old Guarded by him; Each of them fill\u0027d Full to the brim With gold! III. I caught him at work one day, myself, In the castle-ditch, where foxglove grows,— A wrinkled, wizen\u0027d, and bearded Elf, Spectacles stuck on his pointed nose, Silver buckles to his hose, Leather apron—shoe in his lap— \"Rip-rap, tip-tap, Tick-tack-too! (A grasshopper on my cap! Away the moth flew!) Buskins for a fairy prince, Brogues for his son,— Pay me well, pay me well, When the job is done!\" The rogue was mine, beyond a doubt. I stared at him; he stared at me; \"Servant, Sir!\" \"Humph!\" says he, And pull\u0027d a snuff-box out. He took a long pinch, look\u0027d better pleased, The queer little Lepracaun; Offer\u0027d the box with a whimsical grace,— Pouf! he flung the dust in my face, And, while I sneezed, Was gone!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3253/89126.html","bookId":601,"book":{"id":601,"title":"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry","description":"简介： Yet, be it noticed, if you are a stranger, you will not readily [Pg xi] get ghost and fairy legends, even in a western village.
