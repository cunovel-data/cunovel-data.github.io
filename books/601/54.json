{"id":32983,"no":54,"title":"LOUGHLEAGH (LAKE OF HEALING).","content":"\"Do you see that bit of a lake,\" said my companion, turning his eyes towards the acclivity that overhung Loughleagh. \"Troth, and as little as you think of it, and as ugly as it looks with its weeds and its flags, it is the most famous one in all Ireland. Young and ould, rich and poor, far and near, have come to that lake to get cured of all kinds of scurvy and sores. The Lord keep us our limbs whole and sound, for it\u0027s a sorrowful thing not to have the use o\u0027 them. \u0027Twas but last week we had a great grand Frenchman here; and, though he came upon crutches, faith he went home sound as a bell; and well he paid Billy Reily for curing him.\" \"And, pray, how did Billy Reily cure him?\" \"Oh, well enough. He took his long pole, dipped it down to the bottom of the lake, and brought up on the top of it as much plaster as would do for a thousand sores!\" \"What kind of plaster?\" [Pg 207] \"What kind of plaster? why, black plaster to be sure; for isn\u0027t the bottom of the lake filled with a kind of black mud which cures all the world?\" \"Then it ought to be a famous lake indeed.\" \"Famous, and so it is,\" replied my companion, \"but it isn\u0027t for its cures neather that it is famous; for, sure, doesn\u0027t all the world know there is a fine beautiful city at the bottom of it, where the good people live just like Christians. Troth, it is the truth I tell you; for Shemus-a-sneidh saw it all when he followed his dun cow that was stolen.\" \"Who stole her?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you all about it:—Shemus was a poor gossoon, who lived on the brow of the hill, in a cabin with his ould mother. They lived by hook and by crook, one way and another, in the best way they could. They had a bit of ground that gave \u0027em the preaty, and a little dun cow that gave \u0027em the drop o\u0027 milk; and, considering how times go, they weren\u0027t badly off, for Shemus was a handy gossoon to boot; and, while minden the cow, cut heath and made brooms, which his mother sould on a market-day, and brought home the bit o\u0027 tobaccy, the grain of salt, and other nic-nackenes, which a poor body can\u0027t well do widout. Once upon a time, however, Shemus went farther than usual up the mountain, looken for long heath, for town\u0027s-people don\u0027t like to stoop, and so like long handles to their brooms. The little dun cow was a\u0027most as cunning as a Christian sinner, and followed Shemus like a lap-dog everywhere he\u0027d go, so that she required little or no herden. On this day she found nice picken on a round spot as green as a leek; and, as poor Shemus was weary, as a body would be on a fine summer\u0027s day, he lay down on the grass to rest himself, just as we\u0027re resten ourselves on the cairn here. Begad, he hadn\u0027t long lain there, sure enough, when, what should he see but whole loads of ganconers [45] dancing about[Pg 208] the place. Some o\u0027 them were hurlen, some kicking a football, and others leaping a kick-step-and-a-lep. They were so soople and so active that Shemus was highly delighted with the sport, and a little tanned-skinned chap in a red cap pleased him better than any o\u0027 them, bekase he used to tumble the other fellows like mushrooms. At one time he had kept the ball up for as good as half-an-hour, when Shemus cried out, \u0027Well done, my hurler!\u0027 The word wasn\u0027t well out of his mouth when whap went the ball on his eye, and flash went the fire. Poor Shemus thought he was blind, and roared out, \u0027Mille murdher!\u0027 [46] but the only thing he heard was a loud laugh. \u0027Cross o\u0027 Christ about us,\u0027 says he to himself, \u0027what is this for?\u0027 and afther rubbing his eyes they came to a little, and he could see the sun and the sky, and, by-and-by, he could see everything but his cow and the mischievous ganconers. They were gone to their rath or mote; but where was the little dun cow? He looked, and he looked, and he might have looked from that day to this, bekase she wasn\u0027t to be found, and good reason why—the ganconers took her away with \u0027em. \"Shemus-a-sneidh, however, didn\u0027t think so, but ran home to his mother. \"\u0027Where is the cow, Shemus?\u0027 axed the ould woman. \"\u0027Och, musha, bad luck to her,\u0027 said Shemus, \u0027I donna where she is!\u0027 \"\u0027Is that an answer, you big blaggard, for the likes o\u0027 you to give your poor ould mother?\u0027 said she. \"\u0027Och, musha,\u0027 said Shemus, I don\u0027t kick up saich a bollhous about nothing. The ould cow is safe enough, I\u0027ll be bail, some place or other, though I could find her if I put my eyes upon kippeens, [47] and, speaking of eyes, faith, I had very good luck o\u0027 my side, or I had naver a one to look after her.\u0027 \"\u0027Why, what happened your eyes, agrah?\u0027 axed the ould woman. \"\u0027Oh! didn\u0027t the ganconers—the Lord save us from all [Pg 209] hurt and harm!—drive their hurlen ball into them both! and sure I was stone blind for an hour.\u0027 \"\u0027And may be,\u0027 said the mother, \u0027the good people took our cow?\u0027 \"\u0027No, nor the devil a one of them,\u0027 said Shemus, \u0027for, by the powers, that same cow is as knowen as a lawyer, and wouldn\u0027t be such a fool as to go with the ganconers while she could get such grass as I found for her to-day.\u0027\" In this way, continued my informant, they talked about the cow all that night, and next mornen both o\u0027 them set off to look for her. After searching every place, high and low, what should Shemus see sticking out of a bog-hole but something very like the horns of his little beast! \"Oh, mother, mother,\" said he, \"I\u0027ve found her!\" \"Where, alanna?\" axed the ould woman. \"In the bog-hole, mother,\" answered Shemus. At this the poor ould creathure set up such a pullallue that she brought the seven parishes about her; and the neighbours soon pulled the cow out of the bog-hole. You\u0027d swear it was the same, and yet it wasn\u0027t, as you shall hear by-and-by. Shemus and his mother brought the dead beast home with them; and, after skinnen her, hung the meat up in the chimney. The loss of the drop o\u0027 milk was a sorrowful thing, and though they had a good deal of meat, that couldn\u0027t last always; besides, the whole parish faughed upon them for eating the flesh of a beast that died without bleeden. But the pretty thing was, they couldn\u0027t eat the meat after all, for when it was boiled it was as tough as carrion, and as black as a turf. You might as well think of sinking your teeth in an oak plank as into a piece of it, and then you\u0027d want to sit a great piece from the wall for fear of knocking your head against it when pulling it through your teeth. At last and at long run they were forced to throw it to the dogs, but the dogs wouldn\u0027t smell to it, and so it was thrown into the ditch, where it rotted. This misfortune cost poor Shemus many a salt tear, for he was now obliged to work twice as hard as before, and be out cutten [Pg 210] heath on the mountain late and early. One day he was passing by this cairn with a load of brooms on his back, when what should he see but the little dun cow and two red-headed fellows herding her. \"That\u0027s my mother\u0027s cow,\" said Shemus-a-sneidh. \"No, it is not,\" said one of the chaps. \"But I say it is,\" said Shemus, throwing the brooms on the ground, and seizing the cow by the horns. At that the red fellows drove her as fast as they could to this steep place, and with one leap she bounced over, with Shemus stuck fast to her horns. They made only one splash in the lough, when the waters closed over \u0027em, and they sunk to the bottom. Just as Shemus-a-sneidh thought that all was over with him, he found himself before a most elegant palace built with jewels, and all manner of fine stones. Though his eyes were dazzled with the splendour of the place, faith he had gomsh [48] enough not to let go his holt, but in spite of all they could do, he held his little cow by the horns. He was axed into the palace, but wouldn\u0027t go. The hubbub at last grew so great that the door flew open, and out walked a hundred ladies and gentlemen, as fine as any in the land. \"What does this boy want?\" axed one o\u0027 them, who seemed to be the masther. \"I want my mother\u0027s cow,\" said Shemus. \"That\u0027s not your mother\u0027s cow,\" said the gentleman. \"Bethershin!\" [49] cried Shemus-a-sneidh; \"don\u0027t I know her as well as I know my right hand?\" \"Where did you lose her?\" axed the gentleman. And so Shemus up and tould him all about it: how he was on the mountain—how he saw the good people hurlen—how the ball was knocked in his eye, and his cow was lost. \"I believe you are right,\" said the gentleman, pulling out his purse, \"and here is the price of twenty cows for you.\" \"No, no,\" said Shemus, \"you\u0027ll not catch ould birds wid chaff. I\u0027ll have my cow and nothen else.\" [Pg 211] \"You\u0027re a funny fellow,\" said the gentleman; \"stop here and live in a palace.\" \"I\u0027d rather live with my mother.\" \"Foolish boy!\" said the gentleman; \"stop here and live in a palace.\" \"I\u0027d rather live in my mother\u0027s cabin.\" \"Here you can walk through gardens loaded with fruit and flowers.\" \"I\u0027d rather,\" said Shemus, \"be cutting heath on the mountain.\" \"Here you can eat and drink of the best.\" \"Since I\u0027ve got my cow, I can have milk once more with the praties.\" \"Oh!\" cried the ladies, gathering round him, \"sure you wouldn\u0027t take away the cow that gives us milk for our tea?\" \"Oh!\" said Shemus, \"my mother wants milk as bad as anyone, and she must have it; so there is no use in your palaver—I must have my cow.\" At this they all gathered about him and offered him bushels of gould, but he wouldn\u0027t have anything but his cow. Seeing him as obstinate as a mule, they began to thump and beat him; but still he held fast by the horns, till at length a great blast of wind blew him out of the place, and in a moment he found himself and the cow standing on the side of the lake, the water of which looked as if it hadn\u0027t been disturbed since Adam was a boy—and that\u0027s a long time since. Well, Shemus-a-sneidh drove home his cow, and right glad his mother was to see her; but the moment she said \"God bless the beast,\" she sunk down like the breesha [50] of a turf rick. That was the end of Shemus-a-sneidh\u0027s dun cow. \"And, sure,\" continued my companion, standing up, \"it is now time for me to look after my brown cow, and God send the ganconers haven\u0027t taken her!\" Of this I assured him there could be no fear; and so we parted. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3253/89157.html","bookId":601,"book":{"id":601,"title":"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry","description":"简介： Yet, be it noticed, if you are a stranger, you will not readily [Pg xi] get ghost and fairy legends, even in a western village.
