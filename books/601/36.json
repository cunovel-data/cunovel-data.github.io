{"id":32965,"no":36,"title":"GRACE CONNOR. MISS LETITIA MACLINTOCK.","content":"Thady and Grace Connor lived on the borders of a large turf bog, in the parish of Clondevaddock, where they could hear the Atlantic surges thunder in upon the shore, and see the wild storms of winter sweep over the Muckish mountain, [Pg 131] and his rugged neighbours. Even in summer the cabin by the bog was dull and dreary enough. Thady Connor worked in the fields, and Grace made a livelihood as a pedlar, carrying a basket of remnants of cloth, calico, drugget, and frieze about the country. The people rarely visited any large town, and found it convenient to buy from Grace, who was welcomed in many a lonely house, where a table was hastily cleared, that she might display her wares. Being considered a very honest woman, she was frequently entrusted with commissions to the shops in Letterkenny and Ramelton. As she set out towards home, her basket was generally laden with little gifts for her children. \"Grace, dear,\" would one of the kind housewives say, \"here\u0027s a farrel [16] of oaten cake, wi\u0027 a taste o\u0027 butter on it; tak\u0027 it wi\u0027 you for the weans;\" or, \"Here\u0027s half-a-dozen of eggs; you\u0027ve a big family to support.\" Small Connors of all ages crowded round the weary mother, to rifle her basket of these gifts. But her thrifty, hard life came suddenly to an end. She died after an illness of a few hours, and was waked and buried as handsomely as Thady could afford. Thady was in bed the night after the funeral, and the fire still burned brightly, when he saw his departed wife cross the room and bend over the cradle. Terrified, he muttered rapid prayers, covered his face with the blanket; and on looking up again the appearance was gone. Next night he lifted the infant out of the cradle, and laid it behind him in the bed, hoping thus to escape his ghostly visitor; but Grace was presently in the room, and stretching over him to wrap up her child. Shrinking and shuddering, the poor man exclaimed, \"Grace, woman, what is it brings you back? What is it you want wi\u0027 me?\" \"I want naething fae you, Thady, but to put thon wean back in her cradle,\" replied the spectre, in a tone of scorn. \"You\u0027re too feared for me, but my sister Rose willna be [Pg 132] feared for me—tell her to meet me to-morrow evening, in the old wallsteads.\" Rose lived with her mother, about a mile off, but she obeyed her sister\u0027s summons without the least fear, and kept the strange tryste in due time. \"Rose, dear,\" she said, as she appeared before her sister in the old wallsteads, \"my mind\u0027s oneasy about them twa\u0027 red shawls that\u0027s in the basket. Matty Hunter and Jane Taggart paid me for them, an\u0027 I bought them wi\u0027 their money, Friday was eight days. Gie them the shawls the morrow. An\u0027 old Mosey McCorkell gied me the price o\u0027 a wiley coat; it\u0027s in under the other things in the basket. An\u0027 now farewell; I can get to my rest.\" \"Grace, Grace, bide a wee minute,\" cried the faithful sister, as the dear voice grew fainter, and the dear face began to fade—\"Grace, darling! Thady? The children? One word mair!\" but neither cries nor tears could further detain the spirit hastening to its rest! \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3253/89139.html","bookId":601,"book":{"id":601,"title":"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry","description":"简介： Yet, be it noticed, if you are a stranger, you will not readily [Pg xi] get ghost and fairy legends, even in a western village.
