{"id":32979,"no":50,"title":"THE PUDDING BEWITCHED. WILLIAM CARLETON.","content":"\"Moll Roe Rafferty was the son—daughter I mane—of ould Jack Rafferty, who was remarkable for a habit he had [Pg 186] of always wearing his head undher his hat; but indeed the same family was a quare one, as everybody knew that was acquainted wid them. It was said of them—but whether it was thrue or not I won\u0027t undhertake to say, for \u0027fraid I\u0027d tell a lie—that whenever they didn\u0027t wear shoes or boots they always went barefooted; but I heard aftherwards that this was disputed, so rather than say anything to injure their character, I\u0027ll let that pass. Now, ould Jack Rafferty had two sons, Paddy and Molly—hut! what are you all laughing at?—I mane a son and daughter, and it was generally believed among the neighbours that they were brother and sisther, which you know might be thrue or it might not: but that\u0027s a thing that, wid the help o\u0027 goodness, we have nothing to say to. Troth there was many ugly things put out on them that I don\u0027t wish to repate, such as that neither Jack nor his son Paddy ever walked a perch widout puttin\u0027 one foot afore the other like a salmon; an\u0027 I know it was whispered about, that whinever Moll Roe slep\u0027, she had an out-of-the-way custom of keepin\u0027 her eyes shut. If she did, however, for that matther the loss was her own; for sure we all know that when one comes to shut their eyes they can\u0027t see as far before them as another. \"Moll Roe was a fine young bouncin\u0027 girl, large and lavish, wid a purty head o\u0027 hair on her like scarlet, that bein\u0027 one of the raisons why she was called Roe, or red; her arms an\u0027 cheeks were much the colour of the hair, an\u0027 her saddle nose was the purtiest thing of its kind that ever was on a face. Her fists—for, thank goodness, she was well sarved wid them too—had a strong simularity to two thumpin\u0027 turnips, reddened by the sun; an\u0027 to keep all right and tight, she had a temper as fiery as her head—for, indeed, it was well known that all the Rafferties were warm-hearted. Howandiver, it appears that God gives nothing in vain, and of coorse the same fists, big and red as they were, if all that is said about them is thrue, were not so much given to her for ornament as use. At laist, takin\u0027 them in connection wid her lively temper, we have it upon good authority, that there was no danger of their getting blue-moulded for want of [Pg 187] practice. She had a twist, too, in one of her eyes that was very becomin\u0027 in its way, and made her poor husband, when she got him, take it into his head that she could see round a corner. She found him out in many quare things, widout doubt; but whether it was owin\u0027 to that or not, I wouldn\u0027t undertake to say for fraid I\u0027d tell a lie. \"Well, begad, anyhow it was Moll Roe that was the dilsy. [38] It happened that there was a nate vagabone in the neighbourhood, just as much overburdened wid beauty as herself, and he was named Gusty Gillespie. Gusty, the Lord guard us, was what they call a black-mouth Prosbytarian, and wouldn\u0027t keep Christmas-day, the blagard, except what they call \u0027ould style.\u0027 Gusty was rather good-lookin\u0027 when seen in the dark, as well as Moll herself; and, indeed, it was purty well known that—accordin\u0027 as the talk went—it was in nightly meetings that they had an opportunity of becomin\u0027 detached to one another. The quensequence was, that in due time both families began to talk very seriously as to what was to be done. Moll\u0027s brother, Pawdien O\u0027Rafferty, gave Gusty the best of two choices. What they were it\u0027s not worth spakin\u0027 about; but at any rate one of them was a poser, an\u0027 as Gusty knew his man, he soon came to his senses. Accordianly everything was deranged for their marriage, and it was appointed that they should be spliced by the Rev. Samuel M\u0027Shuttle, the Prosbytarian parson, on the following Sunday. \"Now this was the first marriage that had happened for a long time in the neighbourhood betune a black-mouth an\u0027 a Catholic, an\u0027 of coorse there was strong objections on both sides aginst it; an\u0027 begad, only for one thing, it would never \u0027a tuck place at all. At any rate, faix, there was one of the bride\u0027s uncles, ould Harry Connolly, a fairy-man, who could cure all complaints wid a secret he had, and as he didn\u0027t wish to see his niece married upon sich a fellow, he fought bittherly against the match. All Moll\u0027s friends, however, stood up for the marriage barrin\u0027 him, an\u0027 of coorse the [Pg 188] Sunday was appointed, as I said, that they were to be dove-tailed together. \"Well, the day arrived, and Moll, as became her, went to mass, and Gusty to meeting, afther which they were to join one another in Jack Rafferty\u0027s, where the priest, Father M\u0027Sorley, was to slip up afther mass to take his dinner wid them, and to keep Misther M\u0027Shuttle, who was to marry them, company. Nobody remained at home but ould Jack Rafferty an\u0027 his wife, who stopped to dress the dinner, for, to tell the truth, it was to be a great let-out entirely. Maybe, if all was known, too, that Father M\u0027Sorley was to give them a cast of his office over an\u0027 above the ministher, in regard that Moll\u0027s friends were not altogether satisfied at the kind of marriage which M\u0027Shuttle could give them. The sorrow may care about that—splice here—splice there—all I can say is, that when Mrs. Rafferty was goin\u0027 to tie up a big bag pudden, in walks Harry Connolly, the fairy-man, in a rage, and shouts out,—\u0027Blood and blunderbushes, what are yez here for?\u0027 \"\u0027Arrah why, Harry? Why, avick?\u0027 \"\u0027Why, the sun\u0027s in the suds and the moon in the high Horicks; there\u0027s a clipstick comin\u0027 an, an\u0027 there you\u0027re both as unconsarned as if it was about to rain mether. Go out and cross yourselves three times in the name o\u0027 the four Mandromarvins, for as prophecy says:—Fill the pot, Eddy, supernaculum—a blazing star\u0027s a rare spectaculum. Go out both of you and look at the sun, I say, an\u0027 ye\u0027ll see the condition he\u0027s in—off!\u0027 \"Begad, sure enough, Jack gave a bounce to the door, and his wife leaped like a two-year-ould, till they were both got on a stile beside the house to see what was wrong in the sky. \"\u0027Arrah, what is it, Jack,\u0027 said she; \u0027can you see anything?\u0027 \"\u0027No,\u0027 says he, \u0027sorra the full o\u0027 my eye of anything I can spy, barrin\u0027 the sun himself, that\u0027s not visible in regard of the clouds. God guard us! I doubt there\u0027s something to happen.\u0027 [Pg 189] \"\u0027If there wasn\u0027t, Jack, what \u0027ud put Harry, that knows so much, in the state he\u0027s in?\u0027 \"\u0027I doubt it\u0027s this marriage,\u0027 said Jack: \u0027betune ourselves, it\u0027s not over an\u0027 above religious for Moll to marry a black-mouth, an\u0027 only for——; but it can\u0027t be helped now, though you see not a taste o\u0027 the sun is willin\u0027 to show his face upon it.\u0027 \"\u0027As to that,\u0027 says the wife, winkin\u0027 wid both her eyes, \u0027if Gusty\u0027s satisfied wid Moll, it\u0027s enough. I know who\u0027ll carry the whip hand, anyhow; but in the manetime let us ax Harry \u0027ithin what ails the sun.\u0027 \"Well, they accordianly went in an\u0027 put the question to him: \"\u0027Harry, what\u0027s wrong, ahagur? What is it now, for if anybody alive knows, \u0027tis yourself?\u0027 \"\u0027Ah!\u0027 said Harry, screwin\u0027 his mouth wid a kind of a dhry smile, \u0027the sun has a hard twist o\u0027 the cholic; but never mind that, I tell you you\u0027ll have a merrier weddin\u0027 than you think, that\u0027s all;\u0027 and havin\u0027 said this, he put on his hat and left the house. \"Now, Harry\u0027s answer relieved them very much, and so, afther calling to him to be back for the dinner, Jack sat down to take a shough o\u0027 the pipe, and the wife lost no time in tying up the pudden and puttin\u0027 it in the pot to be boiled. \"In this way things went on well enough for a while, Jack smokin\u0027 away, an\u0027 the wife cookin\u0027 and dhressin\u0027 at the rate of a hunt. At last, Jack, while sittin\u0027, as I said, contentedly at the fire, thought he could persave an odd dancin\u0027 kind of motion in the pot that puzzled him a good deal. \"\u0027Katty,\u0027 said he, \u0027what the dickens is in this pot on the fire?\u0027 \"\u0027Nerra thing but the big pudden. Why do you ax?\u0027 says she. \"\u0027Why,\u0027 said he, \u0027if ever a pot tuck it into its head to dance a jig, and this did. Thundher and sparbles, look at it!\u0027 \"Begad, it was thrue enough; there was the pot bobbin\u0027 up an\u0027 down and from side to side, jiggin\u0027 it away as merry [Pg 190] as a grig; an\u0027 it was quite aisy to see that it wasn\u0027t the pot itself, but what was inside of it, that brought about the hornpipe. \"\u0027Be the hole o\u0027 my coat,\u0027 shouted Jack, \u0027there\u0027s something alive in it, or it would never cut sich capers!\u0027 \"\u0027Be gorra, there is, Jack; something sthrange entirely has got into it. Wirra, man alive, what\u0027s to be done?\u0027 \"Jist as she spoke, the pot seemed to cut the buckle in prime style, and afther a spring that \u0027ud shame a dancin\u0027-masther, off flew the lid, and out bounced the pudden itself, hoppin\u0027, as nimble as a pea on a drum-head, about the floor. Jack blessed himself, and Katty crossed herself. Jack shouted, and Katty screamed. \u0027In the name of goodness, keep your distance; no one here injured you!\u0027 \"The pudden, however, made a set at him, and Jack lepped first on a chair and then on the kitchen table to avoid it. It then danced towards Kitty, who was now repatin\u0027 her prayers at the top of her voice, while the cunnin\u0027 thief of a pudden was hoppin\u0027 and jiggin\u0027 it round her, as if it was amused at her distress. \"\u0027If I could get the pitchfork,\u0027 said Jack, \u0027I\u0027d dale wid it—by goxty I\u0027d thry its mettle.\u0027 \"\u0027No, no,\u0027 shouted Katty, thinkin\u0027 there was a fairy in it; \u0027let us spake it fair. Who knows what harm it might do? Aisy now,\u0027 said she to the pudden, \u0027aisy, dear; don\u0027t harm honest people that never meant to offend you. It wasn\u0027t us—no, in troth, it was ould Harry Connolly that bewitched you; pursue him if you wish, but spare a woman like me; for, whisper, dear, I\u0027m not in a condition to be frightened—troth I\u0027m not.\u0027 \"The pudden, bedad, seemed to take her at her word, and danced away from her towards Jack, who, like the wife, believin\u0027 there was a fairy in it, an\u0027 that spakin\u0027 it fair was the best plan, thought he would give it a soft word as well as her. \"\u0027Plase your honour,\u0027 said Jack, \u0027she only spaiks the truth; an\u0027, upon my voracity, we both feels much oblaiged to your honour for your quietness. Faith, it\u0027s quite clear [Pg 191] that if you weren\u0027t a gentlemanly pudden all out, you\u0027d act otherwise. Ould Harry, the rogue, is your mark; he\u0027s jist gone down the road there, and if you go fast you\u0027ll overtake him. Be me song, your dancin\u0027 masther did his duty, anyhow. Thank your honour! God speed you, an\u0027 may you never meet wid a parson or alderman in your thravels!\u0027 \"Jist as Jack spoke the pudden appeared to take the hint, for it quietly hopped out, and as the house was directly on the road-side, turned down towards the bridge, the very way that ould Harry went. It was very natural, of coorse, that Jack and Katty should go out to see how it intended to thravel; and, as the day was Sunday, it was but natural, too, that a greater number of people than usual were passin\u0027 the road. This was a fact; and when Jack and his wife were seen followin\u0027 the pudden, the whole neighbourhood was soon up and afther it. \"\u0027Jack Rafferty, what is it? Katty, ahagur, will you tell us what it manes?\u0027 \"\u0027Why,\u0027 replied Katty, \u0027it\u0027s my big pudden that\u0027s bewitched, an\u0027 it\u0027s now hot foot pursuin\u0027——;\u0027 here she stopped, not wishin\u0027 to mention her brother\u0027s name—\u0027some one or other that surely put pishrogues an it.\u0027 [39] \"This was enough; Jack, now seein\u0027 that he had assistance, found his courage comin\u0027 back to him; so says he to Katty, \u0027Go home,\u0027 says he, \u0027an\u0027 lose no time in makin\u0027 another pudden as good, an\u0027 here\u0027s Paddy Scanlan\u0027s wife, Bridget, says she\u0027ll let you boil it on her fire, as you\u0027ll want our own to dress the rest o\u0027 the dinner: and Paddy himself will lend me a pitchfork, for purshuin to the morsel of that same pudden will escape till I let the wind out of it, now that I\u0027ve the neighbours to back an\u0027 support me,\u0027 says Jack. \"This was agreed to, and Katty went back to prepare a fresh pudden, while Jack an\u0027 half the townland pursued the other wid spades, graips, pitchforks, scythes, flails, and all possible description of instruments. On the pudden went, however, at the rate of about six Irish miles an hour, an\u0027 sich a chase never was seen. Catholics, Prodestants, an\u0027 [Pg 192] Prosbytarians, were all afther it, armed, as I said, an\u0027 bad end to the thing but its own activity could save it. Here it made a hop, and there a prod was made at it; but off it went, an\u0027 some one, as eager to get a slice at it on the other side, got the prod instead of the pudden. Big Frank Farrell, the miller of Ballyboulteen, got a prod backwards that brought a hullabaloo out of him you might hear at the other end of the parish. One got a slice of a scythe, another a whack of a flail, a third a rap of a spade that made him look nine ways at wanst. \"\u0027Where is it goin\u0027?\u0027 asked one. \u0027My life for you, it\u0027s on it\u0027s way to Meeting. Three cheers for it if it turns to Carntaul.\u0027 \u0027Prod the sowl out of it, if it\u0027s a Prodestan\u0027,\u0027 shouted the others; \u0027if it turns to the left, slice it into pancakes. We\u0027ll have no Prodestan\u0027 puddens here.\u0027 \"Begad, by this time the people were on the point of beginnin\u0027 to have a regular fight about it, when, very fortunately, it took a short turn down a little by-lane that led towards the Methodist praichin-house, an\u0027 in an instant all parties were in an uproar against it as a Methodist pudden. \u0027It\u0027s a Wesleyan,\u0027 shouted several voices; \u0027an\u0027 by this an\u0027 by that, into a Methodist chapel it won\u0027t put a foot to-day, or we\u0027ll lose a fall. Let the wind out of it. Come, boys, where\u0027s your pitchforks?\u0027 \"The divle purshuin to the one of them, however, ever could touch the pudden, an\u0027 jist when they thought they had it up against the gavel of the Methodist chapel, begad it gave them the slip, and hops over to the left, clane into the river, and sails away before all their eyes as light as an egg-shell. \"Now, it so happened that a little below this place, the demesne-wall of Colonel Bragshaw was built up to the very edge of the river on each side of its banks; and so findin\u0027 there was a stop put to their pursuit of it, they went home again, every man, woman, and child of them, puzzled to think what the pudden was at all, what it meant, or where it was goin\u0027! Had Jack Rafferty an\u0027 his wife been willin\u0027 to let out the opinion they held about Harry Connolly bewitchin\u0027 it, there is no doubt of it but poor Harry might [Pg 193] be badly trated by the crowd, when their blood was up. They had sense enough, howandiver, to keep that to themselves, for Harry bein\u0027 an\u0027 ould bachelor, was a kind friend to the Raffertys. So, of coorse, there was all kinds of talk about it—some guessin\u0027 this, and some guessin\u0027 that—one party sayin\u0027 the pudden was of there side, another party denyin\u0027 it, an\u0027 insistin\u0027 it belonged to them, an\u0027 so on. \"In the manetime, Katty Rafferty, for \u0027fraid the dinner might come short, went home and made another pudden much about the same size as the one that had escaped, and bringin\u0027 it over to their next neighbour, Paddy Scanlan\u0027s, it was put into a pot and placed on the fire to boil, hopin\u0027 that it might be done in time, espishilly as they were to have the ministher, who loved a warm slice of a good pudden as well as e\u0027er a gintleman in Europe. \"Anyhow, the day passed; Moll and Gusty were made man an\u0027 wife, an\u0027 no two could be more lovin\u0027. Their friends that had been asked to the weddin\u0027 were saunterin\u0027 about in pleasant little groups till dinner-time, chattin\u0027 an\u0027 laughin\u0027; but, above all things, sthrivin\u0027 to account for the figaries of the pudden; for, to tell the truth, its adventures had now gone through the whole parish. \"Well, at any rate, dinner-time was dhrawin\u0027 near, and Paddy Scanlan was sittin\u0027 comfortably wid his wife at the fire, the pudden boilen before their eyes, when in walks Harry Connolly, in a flutter, shoutin\u0027—\u0027Blood an\u0027 blunderbushes, what are yez here for?\u0027 \"\u0027Arra, why, Harry—why, avick?\u0027 said Mrs. Scanlan. \"\u0027Why,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027the sun\u0027s in the suds an\u0027 the moon in the high Horicks! Here\u0027s a clipstick comin\u0027 an, an\u0027 there you sit as unconsarned as if it was about to rain mether! Go out both of you, an\u0027 look at the sun, I say, and ye\u0027ll see the condition he\u0027s in—off!\u0027 \"\u0027Ay, but, Harry, what\u0027s that rowled up in the tail of your cothamore [40] (big coat)?\u0027 \"\u0027Out wid yez,\u0027 said Harry, \u0027an\u0027 pray aginst the clipstick—the sky\u0027s fallin\u0027!\u0027 [Pg 194] \"Begad, it was hard to say whether Paddy or the wife got out first, they were so much alarmed by Harry\u0027s wild thin face an\u0027 piercin\u0027 eyes; so out they went to see what was wondherful in the sky, an\u0027 kep\u0027 lookin\u0027 an\u0027 lookin\u0027 in every direction, but not a thing was to be seen, barrin\u0027 the sun shinin\u0027 down wid great good-humour, an\u0027 not a single cloud in the sky. \"Paddy an\u0027 the wife now came in laughin\u0027, to scould Harry, who, no doubt, was a great wag in his way when he wished. \u0027Musha, bad scran to you, Harry——.\u0027 They had time to say no more, howandiver, for, as they were goin\u0027 into the door, they met him comin\u0027 out of it wid a reek of smoke out of his tail like a lime-kiln. \"\u0027Harry,\u0027 shouted Bridget, \u0027my sowl to glory, but the tail of your cothamore\u0027s a-fire—you\u0027ll be burned. Don\u0027t you see the smoke that\u0027s out of it?\u0027 \"\u0027Cross yourselves three times,\u0027 said Harry, widout stoppin\u0027, or even lookin\u0027 behind him, \u0027for, as the prophecy says—Fill the pot, Eddy——\u0027 They could hear no more, for Harry appeared to feel like a man that carried something a great deal hotter than he wished, as anyone might see by the liveliness of his motions, and the quare faces he was forced to make as he went along. \"\u0027What the dickens is he carryin\u0027 in the skirts of his big coat?\u0027 asked Paddy. \"\u0027My sowl to happiness, but maybe he has stole the pudden,\u0027 said Bridget, \u0027for it\u0027s known that many a sthrange thing he does.\u0027 \"They immediately examined the pot, but found that the pudden was there as safe as tuppence, an\u0027 this puzzled them the more, to think what it was he could be carryin\u0027 about wid him in the manner he did. But little they knew what he had done while they were sky-gazin\u0027! \"Well, anyhow, the day passed and the dinner was ready, an\u0027 no doubt but a fine gatherin\u0027 there was to partake of it. The Prosbytarian ministher met the Methodist praicher—a divilish stretcher of an appetite he had, in throth—on their way to Jack Rafferty\u0027s, an\u0027 as he knew he [Pg 195] could take the liberty, why he insisted on his dinin\u0027 wid him; for, afther all, begad, in thim times the clargy of all descriptions lived upon the best footin\u0027 among one another, not all as one as now—but no matther. Well, they had nearly finished their dinner, when Jack Rafferty himself axed Katty for the pudden; but, jist as he spoke, in it came as big as a mess-pot. \"\u0027Gintlemen,\u0027 said he, \u0027I hope none of you will refuse tastin\u0027 a bit of Katty\u0027s pudden; I don\u0027t mane the dancin\u0027 one that tuck to its thravels to-day, but a good solid fellow that she med since.\u0027 \"\u0027To be sure we won\u0027t,\u0027 replied the priest; \u0027so, Jack, put a thrifle on them three plates at your right hand, and send them over here to the clargy, an\u0027 maybe,\u0027 he said, laughin\u0027—for he was a droll good-humoured man—\u0027maybe, Jack, we won\u0027t set you a proper example.\u0027 \"\u0027Wid a heart an\u0027 a half, yer reverence an\u0027 gintlemen; in throth, it\u0027s not a bad example ever any of you set us at the likes, or ever will set us, I\u0027ll go bail. An\u0027 sure I only wish it was betther fare I had for you; but we\u0027re humble people, gintlemen, and so you can\u0027t expect to meet here what you would in higher places.\u0027 \"\u0027Betther a male of herbs,\u0027 said the Methodist praicher, \u0027where pace is——.\u0027 He had time to go no farther, however; for much to his amazement, the priest and the ministher started up from the table jist as he was goin\u0027 to swallow the first spoonful of the pudden, and before you could say Jack Robinson, started away at a lively jig down the floor. \"At this moment a neighbour\u0027s son came runnin\u0027 in, an\u0027 tould them that the parson was comin\u0027 to see the new-married couple, an\u0027 wish them all happiness; an\u0027 the words were scarcely out of his mouth when he made his appearance. What to think he knew not, when he saw the ministher footing it away at the rate of a weddin\u0027. He had very little time, however, to think; for, before he could sit down, up starts the Methodist praicher, and clappin\u0027 his two fists in his sides chimes in in great style along wid him. [Pg 196] \"\u0027Jack Rafferty,\u0027 says he—and, by the way, Jack was his tenant—\u0027what the dickens does all this mane?\u0027 says he; \u0027I\u0027m amazed!\u0027 \"\u0027The not a particle o\u0027 me can tell you,\u0027 says Jack; \u0027but will your reverence jist taste a morsel o\u0027 pudden, merely that the young couple may boast that you ait at their weddin\u0027; for sure if you wouldn\u0027t, who would?\u0027 \"\u0027Well,\u0027 says he, \u0027to gratify them I will; so just a morsel. But, Jack, this bates Bannagher,\u0027 says he again, puttin\u0027 the spoonful o\u0027 pudden into his mouth; \u0027has there been dhrink here?\u0027 \"\u0027Oh, the divle a spudh,\u0027 says Jack, \u0027for although there\u0027s plinty in the house, faith, it appears the gintlemen wouldn\u0027t wait for it. Unless they tuck it elsewhere, I can make nothin\u0027 of this.\u0027 \"He had scarcely spoken, when the parson, who was an active man, cut a caper a yard high, an\u0027 before you could bless yourself, the three clargy were hard at work dancin\u0027, as if for a wager. Begad, it would be unpossible for me to tell you the state the whole meetin\u0027 was in when they seen this. Some were hoarse wid laughin\u0027; some turned up their eyes wid wondher; many thought them mad, an\u0027 others thought they had turned up their little fingers a thrifle too often. \"\u0027Be goxty, it\u0027s a burnin\u0027 shame,\u0027 said one, \u0027to see three black-mouth clargy in sich a state at this early hour!\u0027 \u0027Thundher an\u0027 ounze, what\u0027s over them at all?\u0027 says others; \u0027why, one would think they\u0027re bewitched. Holy Moses, look at the caper the Methodis cuts! An\u0027 as for the Recther, who would think he could handle his feet at such a rate! Be this an\u0027 be that, he cuts the buckle, and does the threblin\u0027 step aiquil to Paddy Horaghan, the dancin\u0027-masther himself? An\u0027 see! Bad cess to the morsel of the parson that\u0027s not hard at Peace upon a trancher, an\u0027 it of a Sunday too! Whirroo, gintlemen, the fun\u0027s in yez afther all—whish! more power to yez!\u0027 \"The sorra\u0027s own fun they had, an\u0027 no wondher; but judge of what they felt, when all at once they saw ould Jack [Pg 197] Rafferty himself bouncin\u0027 in among them, and footing it away like the best o\u0027 them. Bedad, no play could come up to it, an\u0027 nothin\u0027 could be heard but laughin\u0027, shouts of encouragement, and clappin\u0027 of hands like mad. Now the minute Jack Rafferty left the chair where he had been carvin\u0027 the pudden, ould Harry Connolly comes over and claps himself down in his place, in ordher to send it round, of coorse; an\u0027 he was scarcely sated, when who should make his appearance but Barney Hartigan, the piper. Barney, by the way, had been sent for early in the day, but bein\u0027 from home when the message for him went, he couldn\u0027t come any sooner. \"\u0027Begorra,\u0027 said Barney, \u0027you\u0027re airly at the work, gintlemen! but what does this mane? But, divle may care, yez shan\u0027t want the music while there\u0027s a blast in the pipes, anyhow!\u0027 So sayin\u0027 he gave them Jig Polthogue, an\u0027 after that Kiss my Lady, in his best style. \"In the manetime the fun went on thick an\u0027 threefold, for it must be remimbered that Harry, the ould knave, was at the pudden; an\u0027 maybe he didn\u0027t sarve it about in double quick time too. The first he helped was the bride, and, before you could say chopstick, she was at it hard an\u0027 fast before the Methodist praicher, who gave a jolly spring before her that threw them into convulsions. Harry liked this, and made up his mind soon to find partners for the rest; so he accordianly sent the pudden about like lightnin\u0027; an\u0027 to make a long story short, barrin\u0027 the piper an\u0027 himself, there wasn\u0027t a pair o\u0027 heels in the house but was as busy at the dancin\u0027 as if their lives depinded on it. \"\u0027Barney,\u0027 says Harry, \u0027just taste a morsel o\u0027 this pudden; divle the such a bully of a pudden ever you ett; here, your sowl! thry a snig of it—it\u0027s beautiful.\u0027 \"\u0027To be sure I will,\u0027 says Barney. \u0027I\u0027m not the boy to refuse a good thing; but, Harry, be quick, for you know my hands is engaged, an\u0027 it would be a thousand pities not to keep them in music, an\u0027 they so well inclined. Thank you, Harry; begad that is a famous pudden; but blood an\u0027 turnips, what\u0027s this for?\u0027 [Pg 198] \"The word was scarcely out of his mouth when he bounced up, pipes an\u0027 all, an\u0027 dashed into the middle of the party. \u0027Hurroo, your sowls, let us make a night of it! The Ballyboulteen boys for ever! Go it, your reverence—turn your partner—heel an\u0027 toe, ministher. Good! Well done again—Whish! Hurroo! Here\u0027s for Ballyboulteen, an\u0027 the sky over it!\u0027 \"Bad luck to the sich a set ever was seen together in this world, or will again, I suppose. The worst, however, wasn\u0027t come yet, for jist as they were in the very heat an\u0027 fury of the dance, what do you think comes hoppin\u0027 in among them but another pudden, as nimble an\u0027 merry as the first! That was enough; they all had heard of—the ministhers among the rest—an\u0027 most o\u0027 them had seen the other pudden, and knew that there must be a fairy in it, sure enough. Well, as I said, in it comes to the thick o\u0027 them; but the very appearance of it was enough. Off the three clargy danced, and off the whole weddiners danced afther them, every one makin\u0027 the best of their way home; but not a sowl of them able to break out of the step, if they were to be hanged for it. Throth it wouldn\u0027t lave a laugh in you to see the parson dancin\u0027 down the road on his way home, and the ministher and Methodist praicher cuttin\u0027 the buckle as they went along in the opposite direction. To make short work of it, they all danced home at last, wid scarce a puff of wind in them; the bride and bridegroom danced away to bed; an\u0027 now, boys, come an\u0027 let us dance the Horo Lheig in the barn \u0027idout. But you see, boys, before we go, an\u0027 in ordher that I may make everything plain, I had as good tell you that Harry, in crossing the bridge of Ballyboulteen, a couple of miles below Squire Bragshaw\u0027s demense-wall, saw the pudden floatin\u0027 down the river—the truth is he was waitin\u0027 for it; but be this as it may, he took it out, for the wather had made it as clane as a new pin, and tuckin\u0027 it up in the tail of his big coat, contrived, as you all guess, I suppose, to change it while Paddy Scanlan an\u0027 the wife were examinin\u0027 the sky; an\u0027 for the other, he contrived to bewitch it in the same manner, by gettin\u0027 a fairy to go [Pg 199] into it, for, indeed, it was purty well known that the same Harry was hand an\u0027 glove wid the good people. Others will tell you that it was half a pound of quicksilver he put into it; but that doesn\u0027t stand to raison. At any rate, boys, I have tould you the adventures of the Mad Pudden of Ballyboulteen; but I don\u0027t wish to tell you many other things about it that happened—for fraid I\u0027d tell a lie.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3253/89153.html","bookId":601,"book":{"id":601,"title":"Fairy and Folk Tales of the Irish Peasantry","description":"简介： Yet, be it noticed, if you are a stranger, you will not readily [Pg xi] get ghost and fairy legends, even in a western village.
