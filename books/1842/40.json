Prized for her exquisite beauty, the daughter of one of England\u0027s most influential barons, Gabrielle is also a perfect bargaining chip for a king who needs peace in the Highlands: King John has arranged Gabrielle\u0027s marriage to a good and gentle laird. But this marriage will never take place. \\n For Gabrielle, everything changes in one last burst of freedom--when she and her guards come upon a scene of unimaginable cruelty. With one shot from her bow and arrow, Gabrielle takes a life, saves a life, and begins a war. \\n Within days, the Highlands are aflame with passions as a battle royal flares between enemies old and new. Having come to Scotland to be married, Gabrielle is instead entangled in Highland intrigue. For two sadistic noblemen, underestimating Gabrielle\u0027s bravery and prowess may prove fatal. But thanks to a secret Gabrielle possesses, Colm MacHugh, the most feared man in Scotland, finds a new cause for courage. Under his penetrating gaze, neither Gabrielle\u0027s body nor heart is safe.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/shadow-music-highlands-lairds-3.jpg","author":"Julie Garwood","type":"Historical","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-music-highlands-lairds-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:03 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 3:30:00 PM"}}
