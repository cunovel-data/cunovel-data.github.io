{"id":41603,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER 14 - \u0027LA VIE EN ROSE?\u0027","content":"The entrance to the Roi Galant was a seven-foot golden picture-frame which had once, perhaps, enclosed the vast portrait of a noble European. It was in a discreet corner of the \u0027kitchen\u0027 - the public roulette and boule room, where several tables were still busy. As Bond took Vesper\u0027s arm and led her over the gilded step, he fought back a hankering to borrow some money from the caisse and plaster maximums over the nearest table. But he knew that this would be a brash and cheap gesture pour épater la bourgeoisie. Whether he won or lost, it would be a kick in the teeth to the luck which had been given him. \n The night-club was small and dark, lit only by candles in gilded candelabra whose warm light was repeated in wall mirrors set in more gold picture-frames. The walls were covered in dark red satin and the chairs and banquettes in matching red plush. In the far corner, a trio, consisting of a piano, an electric guitar and drums, was playing \u0027La Vie en Rose\u0027 with muted sweetness. Seduction dripped on the quietly throbbing air. It seemed to Bond that every couple must be touching with passion under the tables. \n They were given a corner table near the door. Bond ordered a bottle of Veuve Clicquot and scrambled eggs and bacon. \n They sat for a time listening to the music and then Bond turned to Vesper: \u0027It\u0027s wonderful sitting here with you and knowing the job\u0027s finished. It\u0027s a lovely end to the day - the prize-giving.\u0027 \n He expected her to smile. She said: \u0027Yes, isn\u0027t it,\u0027 in a rather brittle voice. She seemed to be listening carefully to the music. One elbow rested on the table and her hand supported her chin, but on the back of her hand and not on the palm, and Bond noticed that her knuckles showed white as if her fist was tightly clenched. \n Between the thumb and first two fingers of her right hand she held one of Bond\u0027s cigarettes, as an artist holds a crayon, and though she smoked with composure, she tapped the cigarette occasionally into an ash-try when the cigarette had no ash. \n Bond noticed these small things because he felt intensely aware of her and because he wanted to draw her into his own feeling of warmth and relaxed sensuality. But he accepted her reserve. He thought it came from a desire to protect herself from him, or else it was her reaction to his coolness to her earlier in the evening, his deliberate coolness, which he knew had been taken as a rebuff. \n He was patient. He drank champagne and talked a little about the happenings of the day and about the personalities of Mathis and Leiter and about the possible consequences for Le Chiffre. He was discreet and he only talked about the aspects of the case on which she must have been briefed by London. \n She answered perfunctorily. She said that, of course, they had picked out the two gunmen, but had thought nothing of it when the man with the stick had gone to stand behind Bond\u0027s chair. They could not believe that anything would be attempted in the Casino itself. Directly Bond and Leiter had left to walk over to the hotel, she had telephoned Paris and told M\u0027s representative of the result of the game. She had had to speak guardedly and the agent had rung off without comment. She had been told to do this whatever the result. M had asked for the information to be passed on to him personally at any time of the day or night. \n This was all she said. She sipped at her champagne and rarely glanced at Bond. She didn\u0027t smile. Bond felt frustrated. He drank a lot of champagne and ordered another bottle. The scrambled eggs came and they ate in silence. \n At four o\u0027clock Bond was about to call for the bill when the ma?tre d\u0027h?tel appeared at their table and inquired for Miss Lynd. He handed her a note which she took and read hastily. \n \u0027Oh, it\u0027s only Mathis,\u0027 she said. \u0027He says would I come to the entrance hall. He\u0027s got a message for you. Perhaps he\u0027s not in evening clothes or something. I won\u0027t be a minute. Then perhaps we could go home.\u0027 \n She gave him a strained smile. \u0027I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t feel very good company this evening. It\u0027s been rather a nerve-racking day. I\u0027m so sorry.\u0027 \n Bond made a perfunctory reply and rose, pushing back the table. \u0027I\u0027ll get the bill,\u0027 he said, and watched her take the few steps to the entrance. \n He sat down and lit a cigarette. He felt flat. He suddenly realized that he was tired. The stuffiness of the room hit him as it had hit him in the Casino in the early hours of the previous day. He called for the bill and took a last mouthful of champagne. It tasted bitter, as the first glass too many always does. He would have liked to have seen Mathis\u0027s cheerful face and heard his news, perhaps even a word of congratulation. \n Suddenly the note to Vesper seemed odd to him. It was not the way Mathis would do things. He would have asked them both to join him at the bar of the Casino or he would have joined them in the night-club, whatever his clothes. They would have laughed together and Mathis would have been excited. He had much to tell Bond, more than Bond had to tell him. The arrest of the Bulgarian, who had probably talked some more; the chase after the man with the stick; Le Chiffre\u0027s movements when he left the Casino. \n Bond shook himself. He hastily paid the bill, not waiting for the change. He pushed back his table and walked quickly through the entrance without acknowledging the good-nights of the ma?tre d\u0027h?tel and the doorman. \n He hurried through the gaming-room and looked carefully up and down the long entrance hall. He cursed and quickened his step. There were only one or two officials and two or three men and women in evening clothes getting their things at the vestiaire. \n No Vesper. No Mathis. \n He was almost running. He got to the entrance and looked along the steps to left and right down and amongst the few remaining cars. \n The commissionaire came towards him. \n \u0027A taxi, monsieur?\u0027 \n Bond waved him aside and started down the steps, his eyes staring into the shadows, the night air cold on his sweating temples. \n He was half-way down when he heard a faint cry, then the slam of a door way to the right. With a harsh growl and stutter from the exhaust a beetle-browed Citro?n shot out of the shadows into the light of the moon, its front wheel drive dry-skidding through the loose pebbles of the forecourt. \n Its tail rocked on its soft springs as if a violent struggle was taking place on the back seat. \n With a snarl it raced out to the wide entrance gate in a spray of gravel. A small black object shot out of an open rear window and thudded into a flower-bed. There was a scream of tortured rubber as the tyres caught the boulevard in a harsh left-handed turn, the deafening echo of a Citro?n\u0027s exhaust in second gear, a crash into top, then a swiftly diminishing crackle as the car hared off between the shops on the main street towards the coast road. \n Bond knew he would find Vesper\u0027s evening bag among the flowers. \n He ran back with it across the gravel to the brightly-lit steps and scrabbled through its contents while the commissionaire hovered round him. \n The crumpled note was there amongst the usual feminine baggage. \n \n Can you come out to the entrance hall for a moment? I have news for your companion. \n RENé MATHIS \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554/46093.html","bookId":1283,"book":{"id":1283,"title":"007之大战皇家赌场 Casino Royal","description":"简介： 《007：大战皇家赌场》（Casino Royale）是马丁坎贝尔执导的一部动作惊悚片，为米高梅出品的《007》系列电影第21集，影片根据007教父伊恩弗莱明出版于1953年的第一部邦德小说改编而成，是丹尼尔克雷格担当第六任007后的第一部影片，影片其他主演有爱娃格林、麦斯米科尔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
