{"id":41594,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER 5 - THE GIRL FROM HEADQUARTERS","content":"It was twelve o\u0027clock when Bond left the Splendide and the clock on the mairie was stumbling through its midday carillon. There was a strong scent of pine and mimosa in the air and the freshly watered gardens of the Casino opposite, interspersed with neat gravel parterres and paths, lent the scene a pretty formalism more appropriate to ballet than to melodrama. \n The sun shone and there was a gaiety and sparkle in the air which seemed to promise well for the new era of fashion and prosperity for which the little seaside town, after many vicissitudes, was making its gallant bid. \n Royale-les-Eaux, which lies near the mouth of the Somme before the flat coast-line soars up from the beaches of southern Picardy to the Brittany cliffs which run on to Le Havre, had experienced much the same fortunes as Trouville. \n Royale (without the \u0027Eaux\u0027) also started as a small fishing village and its rise to fame as a fashionable watering-place during the Second Empire was as meteoric as that of Trouville. But as Deauville killed Trouville, so, after a long period of decline, did Le Touquet kill Royale. \n At the turn of the century, when things were going badly for the little seaside town and when the fashion was to combine pleasure with a \u0027cure\u0027, a natural spring in the hills behind Royale was discovered to contain enough diluted sulphur to have a beneficent effect on the liver. Since all French people suffer from liver complaints, Royale quickly became \u0027Royale-les-Eaux\u0027, and \u0027Eau Royale\u0027, in a torpedo-shaped bottle, grafted itself demurely on to the tail of the mineral-water lists in hotels and restaurant cars. \n It did not long withstand the powerful combines of Vichy and Perrier and Vittel. There came a series of lawsuits, a number of people lost a lot of money and very soon its sale was again entirely local. Royale fell back on the takings from the French and English families during the summer, on its fishing-fleet in winter and on the crumbs which fell to its elegantly dilapidated Casino from the table at Le Touquet. \n But there was something splendid about the Negresco baroque of the Casino Royale, a strong whiff of Victorian elegance and luxury, and in 1950 Royale caught the fancy of a syndicate in Paris which disposed of large funds belonging to a group of expatriate Vichyites. \n Brighton had been revived since the war, and Nice. Nostalgia for more spacious, golden times might be a source of revenue. \n The Casino was repainted in its original white and gilt and the rooms decorated in the palest grey with wine-red carpets and curtains. Vast Chandeliers were suspended from the ceilings. The gardens were spruced and the fountains played again and the two main hotels, the Splendide and the Hermitage, were prinked and furbished and restaffed. \n Even the small town and the vieux-port managed to fix welcoming smiles across their ravaged faces, and the main street became gay with the vitrines of great Paris jewellers and couturiers, tempted down for a butterfly season by rent-free sites and lavish promises. \n Then the Mahomet Ali Syndicate was cajoled into starting a high game in the Casino and the Société des Bains de Mer de Royale felt that now at last Le Touquet would have to yield up some of the treasure stolen over the years from its parent plage. \n Against the background of this luminous and sparkling stage Bond stood in the sunshine and felt his mission to be incongruous and remote and his dark profession an affront to his fellow actors. \n He shrugged away the momentary feeling of unease and walked round the back of his hotel and down the ramp to the garage. Before his rendezvous at the Hermitage he decided to take his car down the coast road and have a quick look at Le Chiffre\u0027s villa and then drive back by the inland road until it crossed the route nationale to Paris. \n Bond\u0027s car was his only personal hobby. One of the last of the 4?-litre Bentleys with the supercharger by Amherst Villiers, he had bought it almost new in 1933 and had kept it in careful storage through the war. It was still serviced every year and, in London, a former Bentley mechanic, who worked in a garage near Bond\u0027s Chelsea flat, tended it with jealous care. Bond drove it hard and well and with an almost sensual pleasure. It was a battleship-gray convertible coupe, which really did convert, and it was capable of touring at ninety with thirty miles an hour in reserve. \n Bond eased the car out of the garage and up the ramp and soon the loitering drum-beat of the two-inch exhaust was echoing down the tree-lined boulevard, through the crowded main street of the little town, and off through the sand dunes to the south. \n An hour later, Bond walked into the Hermitage bar and chose a table near one of the broad windows. \n The room was sumptuous with those over-masculine trappings which, together with briar pipes and wire-haired terriers, spell luxury in France. Everything was brass-studded leather and polished mahogany. The curtains and carpets were in royal blue. The waiters wore striped waistcoats and green baize aprons. Bond ordered an Americano and examined the sprinkling of over-dressed customers, mostly from Paris he guessed, who sat talking with focus and vivacity, creating that theatrically clubbable atmosphere of l\u0027heure de l\u0027apéritif \n The men were drinking inexhaustible quarter-bottles of champagne, the women dry martinis. \n \u0027Moi, j\u0027adore le \"Dry\",\u0027 a bright-faced girl at the next table said to her companion, too neat in his unseasonable tweeds, who gazed at her with moist brown eyes over the top of an expensive shooting-stick from Hermes, \u0027fait avec du Gordon\u0027s, bien entendu.\u0027 \n \u0027D\u0027accord, Daisy. Mais tu sais, un zeste de citron . . .\u0027 \n Bond\u0027s eye was caught by the tall figure of Mathis on the pavement outside, his face turned in animation to a darkhaired girl in grey. His arm was linked in hers, high up above the elbow, and yet there was a lack of intimacy in their appearance, an ironical chill in the girl\u0027s profile, which made them seem two separate people rather than a couple. Bond waited for them to come through the street door into the bar, but for appearances\u0027 sake continued to stare out of the window at the passers-by. \n \u0027But surely it is Monsieur Bond?\u0027 Mathis\u0027s voice behind him was full of surprised delight. Bond, appropriately flustered, rose to his feet. \u0027Can it be that you are alone? Are you awaiting someone? May I present my colleague, Mademoiselle Lynd? My dear, this is the gentleman from Jamaica with whom I had the pleasure of doing business this morning.\u0027 \n Bond inclined himself with a reserved friendliness. \u0027It would be a great pleasure,\u0027 he addressed himself to the girl. \u0027I am alone. Would you both care to join me?\u0027 He pulled out a chair and while they sat down he beckoned to a waiter and despite Mathis\u0027s expostulations insisted on ordering the drinks - a fine à l\u0027eau for Mathis and a bacardi for the girl. \n Mathis and Bond exchanged cheerful talk about the fine weather and the prospects of a revival in the fortunes of Royale-les-Eaux. The girl sat silent. She accepted one of Bond\u0027s cigarettes, examined it and then smoked it appreciatively and without affectation, drawing the smoke deeply into her lungs with a little sigh and then exhaling it casually through her lips and nostrils. Her movements were economical and precise with no trace of self-consciousness. \n Bond felt her presence strongly. While he and Mathis talked, he turned from time to time towards her, politely including her in the conversation, but adding up the impressions recorded by each glance. \n Her hair was very black and she wore it cut square and low on the nape of the neck, framing her face to below the clear and beautiful line of her jaw. Although it was heavy and moved with the movements of her head, she did not constantly pat it back into place, but let it alone. Her eyes were wide apart and deep blue and they gazed candidly back at Bond with a touch of ironical disinterest which, to his annoyance, he found he would like to shatter, roughly. Her skin was lightly sun-tanned and bore no trace of makeup except on her mouth which was wide and sensual. Her bare arms and hands had a quality of repose and the general impression of restraint in her appearance and movements was carried even to her fingernails which were unpainted and cut short. Round her neck she wore a plain gold chain of wide flat links and on the fourth finger of the right hand a broad topaz ring. Her medium-length dress was of grey soie sauvage with a square-cut bodice, lasciviously tight across her fine breasts. The skirt was closely pleated and flowered down from a narrow, but not a thin, waist. She wore a three-inch, handstitched black belt. A handstitched black sabretache rested on the chair beside her, together with a wide cart-wheel hat of gold straw, its crown encircled by a thin black velvet ribbon which tied at the back in a short bow. Her shoes were square-toed of plain black leather. \n Bond was excited by her beauty and intrigued by her composure. The prospect of working with her stimulated him. At the same time he felt a vague disquiet. On an impulse he touched wood. \n Mathis had noticed Bond\u0027s preoccupation. After a time he rose. \n \u0027Forgive me,\u0027 he said to the girl, \u0027while I telephone to the Dubernes. I must arrange my rendezvous for dinner tonight. Are you sure you won\u0027t mind being left to your own devices this evening?\u0027 \n She shook her head. \n Bond took the cue and, as Mathis crossed the room to the telephone booth beside the bar, he said: \u0027If you are going to be alone tonight, would you care to have dinner with me?\u0027 \n She smiled with the first hint of conspiracy she had shown. \u0027I would like to very much,\u0027 she said, \u0027and then perhaps you would chaperon me to the Casino where Monsieur Mathis tells me you are very much at home. Perhaps I will bring you luck.\u0027 \n With Mathis gone, her attitude towards him showed a sudden warmth. She seemed to acknowledge that they were a team and, as they discussed the time and place of their meeting, Bond realized that it would be quite easy after all to plan the details of his project with her. He felt that after all she was interested and excited by her role and that she would work willingly with him. He had imagined many hurdles before establishing a rapport, but now he felt he could get straight down to professional details. He was quite honest to himself about the hypocrisy of his attitude towards her. As a woman, he wanted to sleep with her but only when the job had been done. \n When Mathis came back to the table Bond called for his bill. He explained that he was expected back at his hotel to have lunch with friends. When for a moment he held her hand in his he felt a warmth of affection and understanding pass between them that would have seemed impossible half an hour earlier. \n The girl\u0027s eyes followed him out on to the boulevard. \n Mathis moved his chair close to hers and said softly: \u0027That is a very good friend of mine. I am glad you have met each other. I can already feel the ice-floes on the two rivers breaking up.\u0027 He smiled, \u0027I don\u0027t think Bond has ever been melted. It will be a new experience for him. And for you.\u0027 \n She did not answer him directly. \n \u0027He is very good-looking. He reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless in his . . .\u0027 \n The sentence was never finished. Suddenly a few feet away the entire plate-glass window shivered into confetti. The blast of a terrific explosion, very near, hit them so that they were rocked back in their chairs. There was an instant of silence. Some objects pattered down on to the pavement outside. Bottles slowly toppled off the shelves behind the bar. Then there were screams and a stampede for the door. \n \u0027Stay there,\u0027 said Mathis. \n He kicked back his chair and hurtled through the empty window-frame on to the pavement. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554/46084.html","bookId":1283,"book":{"id":1283,"title":"007之大战皇家赌场 Casino Royal","description":"简介： 《007：大战皇家赌场》（Casino Royale）是马丁坎贝尔执导的一部动作惊悚片，为米高梅出品的《007》系列电影第21集，影片根据007教父伊恩弗莱明出版于1953年的第一部邦德小说改编而成，是丹尼尔克雷格担当第六任007后的第一部影片，影片其他主演有爱娃格林、麦斯米科尔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
