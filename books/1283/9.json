{"id":41598,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER 9 - THE GAME IS BACCARAT","content":"Bond looked round, but there was no possibility of being overheard, and the caviar would be waiting for the hot toast from the kitchens. \n \u0027Tell me.\u0027 His eyes glittered with interest. \n \u0027They got the third Bulgar, on the road to Paris. He was in a Citro?n and he had picked up two English hikers as protective colouring. At the road-block his French was so bad that they asked for his papers and he brought out a gun and shot one of the motor-cycle patrol. But the other man got him, I don\u0027t know how, and managed to stop him committing suicide. Then they took him down to Rouen and extracted the story - in the usual French fashion, I suppose. \n \u0027Apparently they were part of a pool held in France for this sort of job - saboteurs, thugs, and so on - and Mathis\u0027s friends are already trying to round up the rest. They were to get two million francs for killing you and the agent who briefed them told them there was absolutely no chance of being caught if they followed his instructions exactly.\u0027 \n She took a sip of vodka. \u0027But this is the interesting part.\u0027 \n \u0027The agent gave them the two camera-cases you saw. He said the bright colours would make it easier for them. He told them that the blue case contained a very powerful smoke-bomb. The red case was the explosive. As one of them threw the red case, the other was to press a switch on the blue case and they would escape under cover of the smoke. In fact, the smoke-bomb was a pure invention to make the Bulgars think they could get away. Both cases contained an identical high-explosive bomb. There was no difference between the blue and the red cases. The idea was to destroy you and the bomb-throwers without trace. Presumably there were other plans for dealing with the third man.\u0027 \n \u0027Go on,\u0027 said Bond, full of admiration for the ingenuity of the double-cross. \n \u0027Well, apparently the Bulgars thought this sounded very fine, but cannily they decided to take no chances. It would be better, they thought, to touch off the smoke-bomb first and, from inside the cloud of smoke, hurl the explosive bomb at you. What you saw was the assistant bomb-thrower pressing down the lever on the phoney smoke-bomb and, of course, they both went up together. \n \u0027The third Bulgar was waiting behind the Splendide to pick his two friends up. When he saw what had happened, he assumed they had bungled. But the police picked up some fragments of the unexploded red bomb and he was confronted with them. When he saw that they had been tricked and that his two friends were meant to be murdered with you, he started to talk. I expect he\u0027s still talking now. But there\u0027s nothing to link all this with Le Chiffre. They were given the job by some intermediary, perhaps one of Le Chiffre\u0027s guards, and Le Chiffre\u0027s name means absolutely nothing to the one who survived.\u0027 \n She finished her story just as the waiters arrived with the caviar, a mound of hot toast, and small dishes containing finely chopped onion and grated hard-boiled egg, the white in one dish and the yoke in another. \n The caviar was heaped on to their plates and they ate for a time in silence. \n After a while Bond said: \u0027It\u0027s very satisfactory to be a corpse who changes places with his murderers. For them it certainly was a case of being hoist with their own petard. Mathis must be very pleased with the day\u0027s work - five of the opposition neutralized in twenty-four hours,\u0027 and he told her how the Muntzes had been confounded. \n \u0027Incidentally,\u0027 he asked, \u0027how did you come to get mixed up in this affair? What section are you in?\u0027 \n \u0027I\u0027m personal assistant to Head of S.\u0027 said Vesper. \u0027As it was his plan, he wanted his section to have a hand in the operation and he asked M if I could go. It seemed only to be a liaison job, so M said yes although he told my chief that you would be furious at being given a woman to work with.\u0027 She paused and when Bond said nothing continued: \u0027I had to meet Mathis in Paris and come down with him. I\u0027ve got a friend who is a vendeuse with Dior and somehow she managed to borrow me this and the frock I was wearing this morning, otherwise I couldn\u0027t possibly have competed with all these people.\u0027 She made a gesture towards the room. \n \u0027The office was very jealous although they didn\u0027t know what the job was. All they knew was that I was to work with a Double O. Of course you\u0027re our heroes. I was enchanted.\u0027 \n Bond frowned. \u0027It\u0027s not difficult to get a Double O number if you\u0027re prepared to kill people,\u0027 he said. \u0027That\u0027s all the meaning it has. It\u0027s nothing to be particularly proud of. I\u0027ve got the corpses of a Japanese cipher expert in New York and a Norwegian double agent in Stockholm to thank for being a Double 0. Probably quite decent people. They just got caught up in the gale of the world like that Yugoslav that Tito bumped off. It\u0027s a confusing business but if it\u0027s one\u0027s profession, one does what one\u0027s told. How do you like the grated egg with your caviar?\u0027 \n \u0027It\u0027s a wonderful combination,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m loving my dinner. It seems a shame . . .\u0027 She stopped, warned by a cold look in Bond\u0027s eye. \n \u0027If it wasn\u0027t for the job, we wouldn\u0027t be here,\u0027 he said. \n Suddenly he regretted the intimacy of their dinner and of their talk. He felt he had said too much and that what was only a working relationship had become confused. \n \u0027Let\u0027s consider what has to be done,\u0027 he said in a matter-of-fact voice. \u0027I\u0027d better explain what I\u0027m going to try and do and how you can help. Which isn\u0027t very much I\u0027m afraid,\u0027 he added. \n \u0027Now these are the basic facts.\u0027 He proceeded to sketch out the plan and enumerate the various contingencies which faced them. \n The ma?tre d\u0027h?tel supervised the serving of the second course and then as they ate the delicious food, Bond continued. \n She listened to him coldly, but with attentive obedience. She felt thoroughly deflated by his harshness, while admitting to herself that she should have paid more heed to the warning of Head of S. \n \u0027He\u0027s a dedicated man,\u0027 her chief had said when he gave her the assignment. \u0027Don\u0027t imagine this is going to be any fun. He thinks of nothing but the job on hand and, while it\u0027s on, he\u0027s absolute hell to work for. But he\u0027s an expert and there aren\u0027t many about, so you won\u0027t be wasting your time. He\u0027s a good-looking chap, but don\u0027t fall for him. I don\u0027t think he\u0027s got much heart. Anyway, good luck and don\u0027t get hurt.\u0027 \n All this had been something of a challenge and she was pleased when she felt she attracted and interested him, as she knew intuitively that she did. Then at a hint that they were finding pleasure together, a hint that was only the first words of a conventional phrase, he had suddenly turned to ice and had brutally veered away as if warmth were poison to him. She felt hurt and foolish. Then she gave a mental shrug and concentrated with all her attention on what he was saying. She would not make the same mistake again. \n \u0027. . . and the main hope is to pray for a run of luck for me, or against him.\u0027 \n Bond was explaining just how baccarat is played. \n \u0027It\u0027s much the same as any other gambling game. The odds against the banker and the player are more or less even. Only a run against either can be decisive and \u0027break the bank\u0027, or break the players. \n \u0027Tonight, Le Chiffre, we know, has bought the baccarat bank from the Egyptian syndicate which is running the high tables here. He paid a million francs for it and his capital has been reduced to twenty-four million. I have about the same. There will be ten players, I expect, and we sit round the banker at a kidney-shaped table. \n \u0027Generally, this table is divided into two tableaux. The banker plays two games, one against each of the tableaux to left and right of him. In the game that banker should be able to win by playing off one tableaux against the other and by first-class accountancy. But there aren\u0027t enough baccarat players yet at Royale and Le Chiffre is just going to pit his luck against the other players at the single tableau. It\u0027s unusual because the odds in favour of the banker aren\u0027t so good, but they\u0027re a shade in his favour and, of course, he has control of the size of the stakes. \n \u0027Well, the banker sits there in the middle with a croupier to rake in the cards and call the amount of each bank and a chef de partie to umpire the game generally. I shall be sitting as near dead opposite Le Chiffre as I can get. In front of him he has a shoe containing six packs of cards, well shuffled. There\u0027s absolutely no chance of tampering with the shoe. The cards are shuffled by the croupier and cut by one of the players and put into the shoe in full view of the table. We\u0027ve checked on the staff and they\u0027re all okay. It would be useful, but almost impossible, to mark all the cards, and it would mean the connivance at least of the croupier. Anyway, we shall be watching for that too.\u0027 \n Bond drank some champagne and continued. \n \u0027Now what happens at the game is this. The banker announces an opening bank of five hundred thousand francs, of five hundred pounds as it is now. Each seat is numbered from the right of the banker and the player next to the banker, or Number 1, can accept this bet and push his money out on to the table, or pass it, if it is too much for him or he doesn\u0027t want to take it. Then Number 2 has the right to take it, and if he refuses, then Number 3, and so on round the table. If no single player takes it all, the bet is offered to the table as a whole and everyone chips in, including sometimes the spectators round the table, until the five hundred thousand is made up. \n \u0027That is a small bet which would immediately be met, but when it gets to a million or two it\u0027s often difficult to find a taker or even, if the bank seems to be in luck, a group of takers to cover the bet. At the moment I shall always try and step in and accept the bet - in fact, I shall attack Le Chiffre\u0027s bank whenever I get a chance until either I\u0027ve bust his bank or he\u0027s bust me. It may take some time, but in the end one of us is bound to break the other, irrespective of the other players at the table, although they can, of course, make him richer or poorer in the meantime. \n \u0027Being the banker, he\u0027s got a slight advantage in the play, but knowing that I\u0027m making a dead set at him and not knowing, I hope, my capital, is bound to play on his nerves a bit, so I\u0027m hoping that we start about equal.\u0027 \n He paused while the strawberries came and the avocado pear. \n For a while they ate in silence, then they talked of other things while the coffee was served. They smoked. Neither of them drank brandy or a liqueur. Finally, Bond felt it was time to explain the actual mechanics of the game. \n \u0027It\u0027s a simple affair,\u0027 he said, \u0027and you\u0027ll understand it at once if you\u0027ve ever played vingt-et-un, where the object is to get cards from the banker which add up more closely to a count of twenty-one than his do. In this game, I get two cards and the banker gets two, and unless anyone wins outright, either or both of us can get one more card. The object of the game is to hold two, or three cards which together count nine points, or as nearly nine as possible. Court cards and tens count nothing; aces one each; any other card its face value. It is only the last figure of your count that signifies. So nine plus seven equals six - not sixteen. \n \u0027The winner is the one whose count is nearest to nine. Draws are played over again.\u0027 \n Vesper listened attentively, but she also watched the look of abstract passion on Bond\u0027s face. \n \u0027Now,\u0027 Bond continued, \u0027when the banker deals me my two cards, if they add up to eight or nine, they\u0027re a \u0027natural\u0027 and I turn them up and I win, unless he has an equal or a better natural. If I haven\u0027t got a natural, I can stand on a seven or a six, perhaps ask for a card or perhaps not, on a five, and certainly ask for a card if my count is lower than five. Five is the turning point of the game. According to the odds, the chances of bettering or worsening your hand if you hold a five are exactly even. \n \u0027Only when I ask for a card or tap mine to signify that I stand on what I have, can the banker look at his. If he has a natural, he turns them up and wins. Otherwise he is faced with the same problems as I was. But he is helped in his decision to draw or not to draw a third card by my actions. If I have stood, he must assume that I have a five, six, or seven: if I have drawn, he will know that I had something less than a six and I may have improved my hand or not with the card he gave me. And this card was dealt to me face up. On its face value and a knowledge of the odds, he will know whether to take another card or to stand on his own. \n \u0027So he has a very slight advantage over me. He has a tiny help over his decision to draw or to stand. But there is always one problem card at this game - shall one draw or stand on a five and what will your opponent do with a five? Some players always draw or always stand. I follow my intuition. \n \u0027But in the end,\u0027 Bond stubbed out his cigarette and called for the bill, \u0027it\u0027s the natural eights and nines that matter, and I must just see that I get more of them than he does.\u0027 \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554/46088.html","bookId":1283,"book":{"id":1283,"title":"007之大战皇家赌场 Casino Royal","description":"简介： 《007：大战皇家赌场》（Casino Royale）是马丁坎贝尔执导的一部动作惊悚片，为米高梅出品的《007》系列电影第21集，影片根据007教父伊恩弗莱明出版于1953年的第一部邦德小说改编而成，是丹尼尔克雷格担当第六任007后的第一部影片，影片其他主演有爱娃格林、麦斯米科尔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
