{"id":41592,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER 3 - NUMBER 007","content":"Head of S (the section of the Secret Service concerned with the Soviet union) was so keen on his plan for the destruction of Le Chiffre, and it was basically his own plan, that he took the memorandum himself and went up to the top floor of the gloomy building overlooking Regent\u0027s Park and through the green baize door and along the corridor to the end room. He walked belligerently up to M\u0027s Chief of Staff, a young sapper who had earned his spurs as one of the secretariat to the Chiefs of Staff committee after having been wounded during a sabotage operation in 1944, and had kept his sense of humour in spite of both experiences. \u0027Now look here, Bill. I want to sell something to the Chief. Is this a good moment?\u0027 \u0027What do you think, Penny?\u0027 The Chief of Staff turned to M\u0027s private secretary who shared the room with him. Miss Moneypenny would have been desirable but for eyes which were cool and direct and quizzical. \u0027Should be all right. He won a bit of a victory at the FO this morning and he\u0027s not got anyone for the next half an hour.\u0027 She smiled encouragingly at Head of S whom she liked for himself and for the importance of his section. \u0027Well, here\u0027s the dope, Bill.\u0027 He handed over the black folder with the red star which stood for Top Secret. \u0027And for God\u0027s sake look enthusiastic when you give it him. And tell him I\u0027ll wait here and read a good code-book while he\u0027s considering it. He may want some more details, and anyway I want to see you two don\u0027t pester him with anything else until he\u0027s finished.\u0027 \u0027All right, sir.\u0027 The Chief of Staff pressed a switch leant towards the intercom on his desk. \u0027Yes?\u0027 asked a quiet, flat voice. \u0027Head of S has an urgent docket for you, sir.\u0027 There was a pause. \u0027Bring it in,\u0027 said a voice. The Chief of Staff released the switch and stood up. \u0027Thanks, Bill. I\u0027ll be next door,\u0027 said Head of S. The Chief of Staff crossed his office and went through the double doors leading into M\u0027s room. In a moment he came out and over the entrance a small blue light burned the warning that M was not to be disturbed. * Later, a triumphant Head of S said to his Number Two: \u0027We nearly cooked ourselves with that last paragraph. He said it was subversion and blackmail. He got pretty sharp about it. Anyway, he approves. Says the idea\u0027s crazy, but worth trying if the Treasury will play and he thinks they will. He\u0027s going to tell them it\u0027s a better gamble than the money we\u0027re putting into deserting Russian colonels who turn double after a few months\u0027 \"asylum\" here. And he\u0027s longing to get at Le Chiffre, and anyway he\u0027s got the right man and wants to try him out on the job.\u0027 \u0027Who is it?\u0027 asked Number Two. \u0027One of the Double O\u0027s - I guess 007. He\u0027s tough and M thinks there may be trouble with those gunmen of Le Chiffre\u0027s. He must be pretty good with the cards or he wouldn\u0027t have sat in the Casino in Monte Carlo for two months before the war watching that Roumanian team work their stuff with the invisible ink and the dark glasses. He and the Deuxième bowled them out in the end and 007 turned in a million francs he had won at shemmy. Good money in those days.\u0027 * James Bond\u0027s interview with M had been short. \u0027What about it, Bond?\u0027 asked M when Bond came back into his room after reading Head of S\u0027s memorandum and after gazing for ten minutes out of the waiting-room window at the distant trees in the park. Bond looked across the desk into the shrewd, clear eyes. \u0027It\u0027s very kind of you, sir, I\u0027d like to do it. But I can\u0027t promise to win. The odds at baccarat are the best after trente-et-quarante - evens except for the tiny cagnotte - but I might get a bad run against me and get cleaned out. Play\u0027s going to he pretty high - opening\u0027ll go up to half a million, I should think.\u0027 Bond was stopped by the cold eyes. M knew all this already, knew the odds at baccarat as well as Bond. That was his job - knowing the odds at everything, and knowing men, his own and the opposition\u0027s. Bond wished he had kept quiet about his misgivings. \u0027He can have a bad run too,\u0027 said M. \u0027You\u0027ll have plenty of capital. Up to twenty-five million, the same as him. We\u0027ll start you on ten and send you another ten when you\u0027ve had a look round. You can make the extra five yourself.\u0027 He smiled. \u0027Go over a few days before the big game starts and get your hand in. Have a talk to Q about rooms and trains, and any equipment you want. The Paymaster will fix the funds. I\u0027m going to ask the Deuxième to stand by. It\u0027s their territory and as it is we shall be lucky if they don\u0027t kick up rough. I\u0027ll try and persuade them to send Mathis. You seemed to get on well with him in Monte Carlo on that other Casino job. And I\u0027m going to tell Washington because of the NATO angle. CIA have got one or two good men at Fontainebleau with the joint intelligence chaps there. Anything else?\u0027 Bond shook his head. \u0027I\u0027d certainly like to have Mathis, sir.\u0027 \u0027Well, we\u0027ll see. Try and bring it off. We\u0027re going to look pretty foolish if you don\u0027t. And watch out. This sounds an amusing job, but I don\u0027t think it\u0027s going to be. Le Chiffre is a good man. Well, best of luck.\u0027 \u0027Thank you, sir,\u0027 said Bond and went to the door. \u0027Just a minute.\u0027 Bond turned. I think I\u0027ll keep you covered, Bond. Two heads are better than one and you\u0027ll need someone to run your communications. I\u0027ll think it over. They\u0027ll get in touch with you at Royale. You needn\u0027t worry. It\u0027ll be someone good.\u0027 Bond would have preferred to work alone, but one didn\u0027t argue with M. He left the room hoping that the man they sent would be loyal to him and neither stupid, nor, worse still, ambitious.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554/46082.html","bookId":1283,"book":{"id":1283,"title":"007之大战皇家赌场 Casino Royal","description":"简介： 《007：大战皇家赌场》（Casino Royale）是马丁坎贝尔执导的一部动作惊悚片，为米高梅出品的《007》系列电影第21集，影片根据007教父伊恩弗莱明出版于1953年的第一部邦德小说改编而成，是丹尼尔克雷格担当第六任007后的第一部影片，影片其他主演有爱娃格林、麦斯米科尔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
