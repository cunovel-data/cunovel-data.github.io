{"id":41607,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER 18 - A CRAG-LIKE FACE","content":"It was extraordinary to hear the third voice. The hour\u0027s ritual had only demanded a duologue against the horrible noise of the torture. Bond\u0027s dimmed senses hardly took it in. Then suddenly he was half-way back to consciousness. He found he could see and hear again. He could hear the dead silence after the one quiet word from the doorway. He could see Le Chiffre\u0027s head slowly come up and the expression of blank astonishment, of innocent amazement, slowly give way to fear. \\n\\n \u0027Shtop,\u0027 had said the voice, quietly. \\n\\n Bond heard slow steps approaching behind his chair. \\n\\n \u0027Dhrop it,\u0027 said the voice. \\n\\n Bond saw Le Chiffre\u0027s hand open obediently and the knife fall with a clatter to the floor. \\n\\n He tried desperately to read into Le Chiffre\u0027s face what was happening behind him, but all he saw was blind incomprehension and terror. Le Chiffre\u0027s mouth worked, but only a high-pitched \u0027eek\u0027 came from it. His heavy cheeks trembled as he tried to collect enough saliva in his mouth to say something, ask something. His hands fluttered vaguely in his lap. One of them made a slight movement towards his pocket, but instantly fell back. His round staring eyes had lowered for a split second and Bond guessed there was a gun trained on him. \\n\\n There was a moment\u0027s silence. \\n\\n \u0027SMERSH.\u0027 \\n\\n The word came almost with a sigh. It came with a downward cadence as if nothing else had to be said. It was the final explanation. The last word of all. \\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Le Chiffre. \u0027No. I . . .\u0027 His voice tailed off. \\n\\n Perhaps he was going to explain, to apologize, but what he must have seen in the other\u0027s face made it all useless. \\n\\n \u0027Your two men. Both dead. You are a fool and a thief and a traitor. I have been sent from the Soviet union to eliminate you. You are fortunate that I have only time to shoot you. If it was possible, I was instructed that you should die most painfully. We cannot see the end of the trouble you have caused.\u0027 \\n\\n The thick voice stopped. There was silence in the room save for the rasping breath of Le Chiffre. \\n\\n Somewhere outside a bird began to sing and there were other small noises from the awakening countryside. The bands of sunlight were stronger and the sweat on Le Chiffre\u0027s face glistened brightly. \\n\\n \u0027Do you plead guilty?\u0027 \\n\\n Bond wrestled with his consciousness. He screwed up his eyes and tried to shake his head to clear it, but his whole nervous system was numbed and no message was transmitted to his muscles. He could just keep his focus on the great pale face in front of him and on its bulging eyes. \\n\\n A thin string of saliva crept from the open mouth and hung down from the chin. \\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said the mouth. \\n\\n There was a sharp \u0027phut\u0027, no louder than a bubble of air escaping from a tube of toothpaste. No other noise at all, and suddenly Le Chiffre had grown another eye, a third eye on a level with the other two, right where the thick nose started to jut out below the forehead. It was a small black eye, without eyelashes or eyebrows. \\n\\n For a second the three eyes looked out across the room and then the whole face seemed to slip and go down on one knee. The two outer eyes turned trembling up towards the ceiling. Then the heavy head fell sideways and the right shoulder and finally the whole upper part of the body lurched over the arm of the chair as if Le Chiffre were going to be sick. But there was only a short rattle of his heels on the ground and then no other movement. \\n\\n The tall back of the chair looked impassively out across the dead body in its arms. \\n\\n There was a faint movement behind Bond. A hand came from behind and grasped his chin and pulled it back. \\n\\n For a moment Bond looked up into two glittering eyes behind a narrow black mask. There was the impression of a crag-like face under a hat-brim, the collar of a fawn mackintosh. He could take in nothing more before his head was pushed down again. \\n\\n \u0027You are fortunate,\u0027 said the voice. \u0027I have no orders to kill you. Your life has been saved twice in one day. But you can tell your organization that SMERSH is only merciful by chance or by mistake. In your case you were saved first by chance and now by mistake, for I should have had orders to kill any foreign spies who were hanging round this traitor like flies round a dog\u0027s mess. \\n\\n \u0027But I shall leave you my visiting-card. You are a gambler. You play at cards. One day perhaps you will play against one of us. It would be well that you should be known as a spy.\u0027 \\n\\n Steps moved round to behind Bond\u0027s right shoulder. There was the click of a knife opening. An arm in some grey material came into Bond\u0027s line of vision. A broad hairy hand emerging from a dirty white shirt-cuff was holding a thin stiletto like a fountain-pen. It poised for a moment above the back of Bond\u0027s right hand, immovably bound with flex to the arm of the chair. The point of the stiletto executed three quick straight slashes. A fourth slash crossed them where they ended, just short of the knuckles. Blood in the shape of an inverted \u0027M\u0027 welled out and slowly started to drip on to the floor. \\n\\n The pain was nothing to what Bond was already suffering, but it was enough to plunge him again into unconsciousness. \\n\\n The steps moved quietly away across the room. The door was softly closed. \\n\\n In the silence, the cheerful small sounds of the summer\u0027s day crept through the closed window. High on the left-hand wall hung two small patches of pink light. They were reflections cast upwards from the floor by the zebra stripes of June sunshine, cast upwards from two separate pools of blood a few feet apart. \\n\\n As the day progressed the pink patches marched slowly along the wall. And slowly they grew larger. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554/46097.html","bookId":1283,"book":{"id":1283,"title":"007之大战皇家赌场 Casino Royal","description":"简介： 《007：大战皇家赌场》（Casino Royale）是马丁坎贝尔执导的一部动作惊悚片，为米高梅出品的《007》系列电影第21集，影片根据007教父伊恩弗莱明出版于1953年的第一部邦德小说改编而成，是丹尼尔克雷格担当第六任007后的第一部影片，影片其他主演有爱娃格林、麦斯米科尔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
