With the choke full out, the engine answered at once to the starter and the roar drowned the faltering words of the commissionaire who jumped aside as the rear wheels whipped gravel at his piped trouser-legs. \\n\\n As the car rocked to the left outside the gate, Bond ruefully longed for the front-wheel drive and low chassis of the Citroen. Then he went fast through the gears and settled himself for the pursuit, briefly savoring the echo of the huge exhaust as it came back at him from either side of the short main street through the town. \\n\\n Soon he was out on the coast road, a broad highway through the sand-dunes which he knew from his morning\u0027s drive had an excellent surface and was well cat\u0027s-eyed on the bends. He pushed the revs up and up, hurrying the car to eighty then to ninety, his huge Marchal headlights boring a safe white tunnel, nearly half a mile long, between the walls of the night. \\n\\n He knew the Citro?n must have come this way. He had heard the exhaust penetrate beyond the town, and a little dust still hung on the bends. He hoped soon to see the distant shaft of its headlights. The night was still and clear. Only out at sea there must be a light summer mist for at intervals he could hear the fog-horns lowing like iron cattle down the coast. \\n\\n As he drove, whipping the car faster and faster through the night, with the other half of his mind he cursed Vesper, and M for having sent her on the job. \\n\\n This was just what he had been afraid of. These blithering women who thought they could do a man\u0027s work. Why the hell couldn\u0027t they stay at home and mind their pots and pans and stick to their frocks and gossip and leave men\u0027s work to the men. And now for this to happen to him, just when the job had come off so beautifully. For Vesper to fall for an old trick like that and get herself snatched and probably held to ranson like some bloody heroine in a strip cartoon. The silly bitch. \\n\\n Bond boiled at the thought of the fix he was in. \\n\\n Of course. The idea was a straight swop. The girl against his cheque for forty million. Well, he wouldn\u0027t play: wouldn\u0027t think of playing. She was in the Service and knew what she was up against. He wouldn\u0027t even ask M. This job was more important than her. It was just too bad. She was a fine girl, but he wasn\u0027t going to fall for this childish trick. No dice. He would try and catch the Citro?n and shoot it out with them and if she got shot in the process, that was too bad too. He would have done his stuff - tried to rescue her before they got her off to some hideout - but if he didn\u0027t catch up with them he would get back to his hotel and go to sleep and say no more about it. The next morning he would ask Mathis what had happened to her and show him the note. If Le Chiffre put the touch on Bond for the money in exchange for the girl, Bond would do nothing and tell no one. The girl would just have to take it. If the commissionaire came along with the story of what he had seen, Bond would bluff it out by saying he had had a drunken row with the girl. \\n\\n Bond\u0027s mind raged furiously on with the problem as he flung the great car down the coast road, automatically taking the curves and watching out for carts or cyclists on their way into Royale. On straight stretches the Amherst Villiers supercharger dug spurs into the Bentley\u0027s twenty-five horses and the engine sent a high-pitched scream of pain into the night. Then the revolutions mounted until he was past 110 and on to the 120 mph mark on the speedometer. \\n\\n He knew he must be gaining fast. Loaded as she was the Citro?n could hardly better eighty even on this road. On an impulse he slowed down to seventy, turned on his fog-lights, and dowsed the twin Marchals. Sure enough, without the blinding curtain of his own lights, he could see the glow of another car a mile or two down the coasts \\n\\n He felt under the dashboard and from a concealed holster took out a long-barrelled Colt Army Special .45, and laid it on the seat beside him. With this, if he was lucky with the surface of the road, he could hope to get their tyres or their petrol tank at anything up to a hundred yards. \\n\\n Then he switched on the big lights again and screamed off in pursuit. He felt calm and at ease. The problem of Vesper\u0027s life was a problem no longer. His face in the blue light from the dashboard was grim but serene. \\n\\n * \\n\\n Ahead in the Citro?n there were three men and the girl. Le Chiffre was driving, his big fluid body hunched forward, his hands light and delicate on the wheel. Beside him sat the squat man who had carried the stick in the Casino. In his left hand he grasped a thick lever which protruded beside him almost level with the floor. It might have been a lever to adjust the driving seat. \\n\\n In the back seat was the tall thin gunman. He lay back relaxed, gazing at the ceiling, apparently uninterested in the wild speed of the car. His right hand lay caressingly on Vesper\u0027s left thigh which stretched out naked beside him. \\n\\n Apart from her legs, which were naked to the hips, Vesper was only a parcel. Her long black velvet skirt had been lifted over her arms and head and tied above her head with a piece of rope. Where her face was, a small gap had been torn in the velvet so that she could breathe. She was not bound in any other way and she lay quiet, her body moving sluggishly with the swaying of the car. \\n\\n Le Chiffre was concentrating half on the road ahead and half on the onrushing glare of Bond\u0027s headlights in the driving-mirror. He seemed undisturbed when not more than a mile separated the hare from the hounds and he even brought the car down from eighty to sixty miles an hour. Now, as he swept round a bend he slowed down still further. A few hundred yards ahead a Michelin post showed where a small parochial road crossed with the highway. \\n\\n \u0027Attention,\u0027 he said sharply to the man beside him. \\n\\n The man\u0027s hand tightened on the lever. \\n\\n A hundred yards from the cross-roads he slowed to thirty. In the mirror Bond\u0027s great headlights were lighting up the bend. \\n\\n Le Chiffre seemed to make up his mind. \\n\\n \u0027Allez.\u0027 \\n\\n The man beside him pulled the lever sharply upwards. The boot at the back of the car yawned open like a whale\u0027s mouth. There was a tinkling clatter on the road and then a rhythmic jangling as if the car was towing lengths of chain behind it. \\n\\n \u0027Coupez.\u0027 \\n\\n The man depressed the lever sharply and the jangling stopped with a final clatter. \\n\\n Le Chiffre glanced again in the mirror. Bond\u0027s car was just entering the bend. Le Chiffre made a racing change and threw the Citro?n left-handed down the narrow side-road, at the same time dowsing his lights. \\n\\n He stopped the car with a jerk and all three men got swiftly out and doubled back under cover of a low hedge to the cross-roads, now fiercely illuminated by the lights of the Bentley. Each of them carried a revolver and the thin man also had what looked like a large black egg in his right hand. \\n\\n The Bentley screamed down towards them like an express train. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554/46094.html","bookId":1283,"book":{"id":1283,"title":"007之大战皇家赌场 Casino Royal","description":"简介： 《007：大战皇家赌场》（Casino Royale）是马丁坎贝尔执导的一部动作惊悚片，为米高梅出品的《007》系列电影第21集，影片根据007教父伊恩弗莱明出版于1953年的第一部邦德小说改编而成，是丹尼尔克雷格担当第六任007后的第一部影片，影片其他主演有爱娃格林、麦斯米科尔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
