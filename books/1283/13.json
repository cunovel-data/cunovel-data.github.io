Le Chiffre hit the shoe with a flat-handed slap that made it rattle. As an afterthought he took out his benzedrine inhaler and sucked the vapour up his nose. \\n\\n \u0027Filthy brute,\u0027 said Mrs Du Pont on Bond\u0027s left. \\n\\n Bond\u0027s mind was clear again. By a miracle he had survived a devastating wound. He could feel his armpits still wet with the fear of it. But the success of his gambit with the chair had wiped out all memories of the dreadful valley of defeat through which he had just passed. \\n\\n He had made a fool of himself. The game had been interrupted for at least ten minutes, a delay unheard of in a respectable casino, but now the cards were waiting for him in the shoe. They must not fail him. He felt his heart lift at the prospect of what was to come. \\n\\n It was two o\u0027clock in the morning. Apart from the thick crowd round the big game, play was still going on at three of the chemin-de-fer games and at the same number of roulette tables. \\n\\n In the silence round his own table, Bond suddenly heard a distant croupier intone: \u0027Neuf. Le rouge gagne, impair et manque.\u0027 \\n\\n Was this an omen for him or for Le Chiffre? \\n\\n The two cards slithered towards him across the green sea. \\n\\n Like an octopus under a rock, Le Chiffre watched him from the other side of the table. \\n\\n Bond reached out a steady right hand and drew the cards towards him. Would it be the lift of the heart which a nine brings, or an eight brings? \\n\\n He fanned the two cards under the curtain of his hand. The muscles of his jaw rippled as he clenched his teeth. His whole body stiffened in a reflex of self-defence. \\n\\n He had two queens, two red queens. \\n\\n They looked roguishly back at him from the shadows. They were the worst. They were nothing. Zero. Baccarat. \\n\\n \"A card,\" said Bond fighting to keep hopelessness out of his voice. He felt Le Chiffre\u0027s eyes boring into his brain. \\n\\n The banker slowly turned his own two cards face up. \\n\\n He had a count of three - a king and a black three. \\n\\n Bond softly exhaled a cloud of tobacco smoke. He still had a chance. Now he was really faced with the moment of truth. Le Chiffre slapped the shoe, slipped out a card, Bond\u0027s fate, and slowly turned it face up. \\n\\n It was a nine, a wonderful nine of hearts, the card known in gipsy magic as \u0027a whisper of love, a whisper of hate\u0027, the card that meant almost certain victory for Bond. \\n\\n The croupier slipped it delicately across. To Le Chiffre it meant nothing. Bond might have had a one, in which case he now had ten points, or nothing, or baccarat, as it is called. Or he might have had a two, three, four, or even five. In which case, with the nine, his maximum count would be four. \\n\\n Holding a three and giving nine is one of the moot situations at the game. The odds are so nearly divided between to draw or not to draw. Bond let the banker sweat it out. Since his nine could only be equalled by the banker drawing a six, he would normally have shown his count if it had been a friendly game. \\n\\n Bond\u0027s cards lay on the table before him, the two impersonal pale pink-patterned backs and the faced nine of hearts. To Le Chiffre the nine might be telling the truth or many variations of lies. \\n\\n The whole secret lay in the reverse of the two pink backs where the pair of queens kissed the green cloth. \\n\\n The sweat was running down either side of the banker\u0027s beaky nose. His thick tongue came out slyly and licked a drop out of the corner of his red gash of a mouth. He looked at Bond\u0027s cards, and then at his own, and then back at Bond\u0027s. \\n\\n Then his whole body shrugged and he slipped out a card for himself from the lisping shoe. \\n\\n He faced it. The table craned. It was a wonderful card, a five. \\n\\n \u0027Huit à la banque,\u0027 said the croupier. \\n\\n As Bond sat silent, Le Chiffre suddenly grinned wolfishly. He must have won. \\n\\n The croupier\u0027s spatula reached almost apologetically across the table. There was not a man at the table who did not believe Bond was defeated. \\n\\n The spatula flicked the two pink cards over on their backs. The gay red queens smiled up at the lights. \\n\\n \u0027Et le neuf.\u0027 \\n\\n A great gasp went up round the table, and then a hubbub of talk. \\n\\n Bond\u0027s eyes were on Le Chiffre. The big man fell back in his chair as if slugged above the heart. His mouth opened and shut once or twice and his right hand felt at his throat. Then he rocked back. His lips were grey. \\n\\n As the huge stack of plaques was shunted across the table to Bond the banker reached into an inner pocket of his jacket and threw a wad of notes on to the table. \\n\\n The croupier riffled through them. \\n\\n \u0027Un banco de dix millions,\u0027 he announced. He slapped down their equivalent in ten plaques of a million each. \\n\\n This is the kill, thought Bond. This man has reached the point of no return. This is the last of his capital. He has come to where I stood an hour ago and he is making the last gesture that I made. But if this man loses, there is no one to come to his aid, no miracle to help him. \\n\\n Bond sat back and lit a cigarette. On a small table beside him half a bottle of Clicquot and a glass had materialized. Without asking who the benefactor was, Bond filled the glass to the brim and drank it down in two long draughts. \\n\\n Then he leant back with his arms curled forward on the table in front of him like the arms of a wrestler seeking a hold at the opening of a bout of ju-jitsu. \\n\\n The players on his left remained silent. \\n\\n \u0027Banco,\u0027 he said, speaking straight at Le Chiffre. \\n\\n Once more the two cards were borne over to him and this time the croupier slipped them into the green lagoon between the outstretched arms. \\n\\n Bond curled his right hand in, glanced briefly down and flipped the cards face up into the middle of the table. \\n\\n \u0027Le Neuf,\u0027 said the croupier. \\n\\n Le Chiffre was gazing down at his own two black kings. \\n\\n \u0027Et le baccarat,\u0027 and the croupier eased across the table the fat tide of plaques. \\n\\n Le Chiffre watched them go to join the serried millions in the shadow of Bond\u0027s left arm, then he stood up slowly and without a word he brushed past the players to the break in the rail. He unhooked the velvet-covered chain and let it fall. The spectators opened a way for him. They looked at him curiously and rather fearfully as if he carried the smell of death on him. Then he vanished from Bond\u0027s sight. \\n\\n Bond stood up. He took a hundred-mille plaque from the stacks beside him and slipped it across the table to the chef de partie. He cut short the effusive thanks and asked the croupier to have his winnings carried to the caisse. The other players were leaving their seats. With no bankers there could be no game, and by now it was half past two. He exchanged some pleasant words with his neighbours to right and left and then ducked under the rail to where Vesper and Felix Leiter were waiting for him. \\n\\n Together they walked over to the caisse. Bond was invited to come into the private office of the Casino directors. On the desk lay his huge pile of chips. He added the contents of his pockets to it. \\n\\n In all there was over seventy million francs. \\n\\n Bond took Felix Leiter\u0027s money in notes and took a cheque to cash on the Credit Lyonnais for the remaining forty-odd million. He was congratulated warmly on his winnings. The directors hoped that he would be playing again that evening. \\n\\n Bond gave an evasive reply. He walked over to the bar and handed Leiter\u0027s money to him. For a few minutes they discussed the game over a bottle of champagne. Leiter took a .45 bullet out of his pocket and placed it on the table. \\n\\n \u0027I gave the gun to Mathis,\u0027 he said. \u0027He\u0027s taken it away. He was as puzzled as we were by the spill you took. He was standing at the back of the crowd with one of his men when it happened. The gunman got away without difficulty. You can imagine how they kicked themselves when they saw the gun. Mathis gave me this bullet to show you what you escaped. The nose has been cut with a dumdum cross. You\u0027d have been in a terrible mess. But they can\u0027t tie it on to Le Chiffre. The man came in alone. They\u0027ve got the form he filled up to get his entrance card. Of course, it\u0027ll all be phony. He got permission to bring the stick in with him. He had a certificate for a war-wound pension. These people certainly get themselves well organized. They\u0027ve got his prints and they\u0027re on the Belinograph to Paris, so we may hear more about him in the morning.\u0027 Felix Leiter tapped out another cigarette. \u0027Anyway, all\u0027s well that ends well. You certainly took Le Chiffre for a ride at the end, though we had some bad moments. I expect you did too.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond smiled. \u0027That envelope was the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me. I thought I was really finished. It wasn\u0027t at all a pleasant feeling. Talk about a friend in need. One day I\u0027ll try and return the compliment.\u0027 \\n\\n He rose. \u0027I\u0027ll just go over to the hotel and put this away,\u0027 he said, tapping his pocket. \u0027I don\u0027t like wandering around with Le Chiffre\u0027s death-warrant on me. He might get ideas. Then I\u0027d like to celebrate a bit. What do you think?\u0027 \\n\\n He turned to Vesper. She had hardly said a word since the end of the game. \\n\\n \u0027Shall we have a glass of champagne in the night-club before we go to bed? It\u0027s called the Roi Galant. You get to it through the public rooms. It looks quite cheerful.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I think I\u0027d love to,\u0027 said Vesper. \u0027I\u0027ll tidy up while you put your winnings away. I\u0027ll meet you in the entrance hall.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What about you, Felix?\u0027 Bond hoped he could be alone with Vesper. \\n\\n Leiter looked at him and read his mind. \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d rather take a little rest before breakfast,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s been quite a day and I expect Paris will want me to do a bit of mopping-up tomorrow. There are several loose ends you won\u0027t have to worry about. I shall. I\u0027ll walk over to the hotel with you. Might as well convoy the treasure ship right into port.\u0027 \\n\\n They strolled over through the shadows cast by the full moon. Both had their hands on their guns. It was three o\u0027clock in the morning, but there were several people about and the courtyard of the Casino was still lined with motorcars. \\n\\n The short walk was uneventful. \\n\\n At the hotel, Leiter insisted on accompanying Bond to his room. It was as Bond had left it six hours before. \\n\\n \u0027No reception committee,\u0027 observed Leiter, \u0027but I wouldn\u0027t put it past them to try a last throw. Do you think I ought to stay up and keep you two company?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You get your sleep,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Don\u0027t worry about us. They won\u0027t be interested in me without the money and I\u0027ve got an idea for looking after that. Thanks for all you\u0027ve done. I hope we get on a job again one day.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Suits me,\u0027 said Leiter, \u0027so long as you can draw a nine when it\u0027s needed - and bring Vesper along with you,\u0027 he added dryly. He went out and closed the door. \\n\\n Bond turned back to the friendliness of his room. \\n\\n After the crowded arena of the big table and the nervous strain of the three hours\u0027 play, he was glad to be alone for a moment and be welcomed by his pyjamas on the bed and his hairbrushes on the dressing-table. He went into the bathroom and dashed cold water over his face and gargled with a sharp mouthwash. He felt the bruises on the back of his head and on his right shoulder. He reflected cheerfully how narrowly he had twice that day escaped being murdered. Would he have to sit up all that night and wait for them to come again, or was Le Chiffre even now on his way to Le Havre or Bordeaux to pick up a boat for some corner of the world where he could escape the eyes and the guns of SMERSH? \\n\\n Bond shrugged his shoulders. Sufficient unto that day had been its evil. He gazed for a moment into the mirror and wondered about Vesper\u0027s morals. He wanted her cold and arrogant body. He wanted to see tears and desire in her remote blue eyes and to take the ropes of her black hair in his hands and bend her long body back under his. Bond\u0027s eyes narrowed and his face in the mirror looked back at him with hunger. \\n\\n He turned away and took out his pocket the cheque for forty million francs. He folded this very small. Then he opened the door and looked up and down the corridor. He left the door wide open and with his ears cocked for footsteps or the sound of the lift, he set to work with a small screwdriver. \\n\\n Five minutes later he gave a last-minute survey to his handiwork, put some fresh cigarettes in his case, closed and locked the door and went off down the corridor and across the hall and out into the moonlight. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554/46092.html","bookId":1283,"book":{"id":1283,"title":"007之大战皇家赌场 Casino Royal","description":"简介： 《007：大战皇家赌场》（Casino Royale）是马丁坎贝尔执导的一部动作惊悚片，为米高梅出品的《007》系列电影第21集，影片根据007教父伊恩弗莱明出版于1953年的第一部邦德小说改编而成，是丹尼尔克雷格担当第六任007后的第一部影片，影片其他主演有爱娃格林、麦斯米科尔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
