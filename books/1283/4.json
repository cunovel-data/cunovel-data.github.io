{"id":41593,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER 4 - L\u0027ENNEMI éCOUTE","content":"As two weeks later, James Bond awoke in his room at the H?tel Splendide, some of this history passed through his mind. \n He had arrived at Royale-les-Eaux in time for luncheon two days before. There had been no attempt to contact him and there had been no flicker of curiosity when he had signed the register \u0027James Bond, Port Maria, Jamaica\u0027. \n M had expressed no interest in his cover. \n \u0027Once you start to make a set at Le Chiffre at the tables, you\u0027ll have had it,\u0027 he said. \u0027But wear a cover that will stick with the general public.\u0027 \n Bond knew Jamaica well, so he asked to be controlled from there and to pass as a Jamaican plantocrat whose father had made his pile in tobacco and sugar and whose son chose to play it away on the stock markets and in casinos. If inquiries were made, he would quote Charles DaSilva of Chaffery\u0027s, Kingston, as his attorney. Charles would make the story stick. \n Bond had spent the last two afternoons and most of the nights at the Casino, playing complicated progression systems on the even chances at roulette. He made a high banco at chemin-de-fer whenever he heard one offered. If he lost, he would suivi once and not chase it further if he lost the second time. \n In this way he had made some three million francs and had given his nerves and card-sense a thorough work-out. He had got the geography of the Casino clear in his mind. Above all, he had been able to observe Le Chiffre at the tables and to note ruefully that he was a faultless and lucky gambler. \n Bond liked to make a good breakfast. After a cold shower, he sat at the writing-table in front of the window. He looked out at the beautiful day and consumed half a pint of iced orange juice, three scrambled eggs and bacon and a double portion of coffee without sugar. He lit his first cigarette, a Balkan and Turkish mixture made for him by Morlands of Grosvenor Street, and watched the small waves lick the long seashore and the fishing-fleet from Dieppe string out towards the June heat-haze followed by a paper-chase of herring-gulls. \n He was lost in his thoughts when the telephone rang. It was the concierge announcing that a Director of Radio Stentor was waiting below with the wireless set he had ordered from Paris. \n \u0027Of course,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Send him up.\u0027 \n This was the cover fixed by the Deuxième Bureau for their liaison man with Bond. Bond watched the door, hoping that it would be Mathis. \n When Mathis came in, a respectable business-man carrying a large square parcel by its leather handle, Bond smiled broadly and would have greeted him with warmth if Mathis had not frowned and held up his free hand after carefully closing the door. \n \u0027I have just arrived from Paris, monsieur, and here is the set you asked to have on approval - five valves, superhet, I think you call it in England, and you should be able to get most of the capitals of Europe from Royale. There are no mountains for forty miles in any direction.\u0027 \n \u0027It sounds all right,\u0027 said Bond, lifting his eyebrows at this mystery-making. \n Mathis paid no attention. He placed the set, which he had unwrapped, on the floor beside the unlit panel electric fire below the mantelpiece. \n \u0027It is just past eleven,\u0027 he said, \u0027and I see that the Compagnons de la Chanson should now be on the medium wave from Rome. They are touring Europe. Let us see what the reception is like. It should be a fair test.\u0027 \n He winked. Bond noticed that he had turned the volume on to full and that the red light indicating the long waveband was illuminated, though the set was still silent. \n Mathis fiddled at the back of the set. Suddenly an appalling roar of static filled the small room. Mathis gazed at the set for a few seconds with benevolence and then turned it off and his voice was full of dismay. \n \u0027My dear monsieur - forgive me please - badly tuned,\u0027 and he again bent to the dials. After a few adjustments the close harmony of the French came over the air and Mathis walked up and clapped Bond very hard on the back and wrang his hand until Bond\u0027s fingers ached. \n Bond smiled back at him. \u0027Now, what the hell?\u0027 he asked. \n \u0027My dear friend,\u0027 Mathis was delighted, \u0027you are blown, blown, blown. Up there,\u0027 he pointed at the ceiling, \u0027at this moment, either Monsieur Muntz or his alleged wife, allegedly bedridden with the grippe, is deafened, absolutely deafened, and I hope in agony.\u0027 He grinned with pleasure at Bond\u0027s frown of disbelief. \n Mathis sat down on the bed and ripped open a packet of Caporal with his thumbnail. Bond waited. \n Mathis was satisfied with the sensation his words had caused. He became serious. \n \u0027How it has happened I don\u0027t know. They must have been on to you for several days before you arrived. The opposition is here in real strength. Above you is the Muntz family. He is German. She is from somewhere in Central Europe, perhaps a Czech. This is an old-fashioned hotel. There are disused chimneys behind these electric fires. Just here,\u0027 he pointed a few inches above the panel fire, \u0027is suspended a very powerful radio pick-up. The wires run up the chimney to behind the Muntzes\u0027 electric fire where there is an amplifier. In their room is a wire-recorder and a pair of earphones on which the Muntzes listen in turn. That is why Madame Muntz has the grippe and takes all her meals in bed and why Monsieur Muntz has to be constantly at her side instead of enjoying the sunshine and the gambling of this delightful resort. \n \u0027Some of this we knew because in France we are very clever. The rest we confirmed by unscrewing your electric fire a few hours before you got here.\u0027 \n Suspiciously Bond walked over and examined the screws which secured the panel to the wall. Their grooves showed minute scratches. \n \u0027Now it is time for a little more play-acting,\u0027 said Mathis. He walked over to the radio, which was still transmitting close harmony to its audience of three, and switched it off. \n \u0027Are you satisfied, monsieur?\u0027 he asked. \u0027You notice how clearly they came over. Are they not a wonderful team?\u0027 He made a winding motion with his right hand and raised his eyebrows. \n \u0027They are so good,\u0027 said Bond, \u0027that I would like to hear the rest of the programme.\u0027 He grinned at the thought of the angry glances which the Muntzes must be exchanging overhead. \u0027The machine itself seems splendid. Just what I was looking for to take back to Jamaica.\u0027 \n Mathis made a sarcastic grimace and switched back to the Rome programme. \n \u0027You and your Jamaica,\u0027 he said, and sat down again on the bed. \n Bond frowned at him. \u0027Well, it\u0027s no good crying over spilt milk,\u0027 he said. \u0027We didn\u0027t expect the cover to stick for long, but it\u0027s worrying that they bowled it out so soon.\u0027 He searched his mind in vain for a clue. Could the Russians have broken one of our ciphers? If so, he might just as well pack up and go home. He and his job would have been stripped naked. \n Mathis seemed to read his mind. \u0027It can\u0027t have been a cipher,\u0027 he said. \u0027Anyway, we told London at once and they will have changed them. A pretty flap we caused, I can tell you.\u0027 He smiled with the satisfaction of a friendly rival. \u0027And now to business, before our good \"Compagnons\" run out of breath. \n \u0027First of all,\u0027 and he inhaled a thick lungful of Caporal, \u0027you will be pleased with your Number Two. She is very beautiful\u0027 - Bond frowned - \u0027very beautiful indeed.\u0027 Satisfied with Bond\u0027s reaction, Mathis continued: \u0027She has black hair, blue eyes, and splendid . . . er . . . protuberances. Back and front,\u0027 he added. \u0027And she is a wireless expert which, though sexually less interesting, makes her a perfect employee of Radio Stentor and assistant to myself in my capacity as wireless salesman for this rich summer season down here.\u0027 He grinned. \u0027We are both staying in the hotel and my assistant will thus be on hand in case your new radio breaks down. All new machines, even French ones, are apt to have teething troubles in the first day or two. And occasionally at night,\u0027 he added with an exaggerated wink. \n Bond was not amused. \u0027What the hell do they want to send me a woman for?\u0027 he said bitterly. \u0027Do they think this is a bloody picnic?\u0027 \n Mathis interrupted. \u0027Calm yourself, my dear James. She is as serious as you could wish and as cold as an icicle. She speaks French like a native and knows her job backwards. Her cover\u0027s perfect and I have arranged for her to team up with you quite smoothly. What is more natural than that you should pick up a pretty girl here? As a Jamaican millionaire,\u0027 he coughed respectfully, \u0027what with your hot blood and all, you would look naked without one.\u0027 \n Bond grunted dubiously. \n \u0027Any other surprises?\u0027 he asked suspiciously. \n \u0027Nothing very much,\u0027 answered Mathis. \u0027Le Chiffre is installed in his villa. It\u0027s about ten miles down the coast road. He has his two guards with him. They look pretty capable fellows. One of them has been seen visiting a little \"pension\" in the town where three mysterious and rather subhuman characters checked in two days ago. They may be part of the team. Their papers are in order - stateless Czechs apparently - but one of our men says the language they talk in their room is Bulgarian. We don\u0027t see many of those around. They\u0027re mostly used against the Turks and the Yugoslavs. They\u0027re stupid, but obedient. The Russians use them for simple killings or as fall-guys for more complicated ones.\u0027 \n \u0027Thanks very much. Which is mine to be?\u0027 asked Bond. \u0027Anything else?\u0027 \n \u0027No. Come to the bar of the Hermitage before lunch. I\u0027ll fix the introduction. Ask her to dinner this evening. Then it will be natural for her to come into the Casino with you. I\u0027ll be there too, but in the background. I\u0027ve got one or two good chaps and we\u0027ll keep an eye on you. Oh, and there\u0027s an American called Leiter here, staying in the hotel. Felix Leiter. He\u0027s the CIA chap from Fontainebleau. London told me to tell you. He looks okay. May come in useful.\u0027 \n A torrent of Italian burst from the wireless set on the floor. Mathis switched it off and they exchanged some phrases about the set and about how Bond should pay for it. Then with effusive farewells and a final wink Mathis bowed himself out. \n Bond sat at the window and gathered his thoughts. Nothing that Mathis had told him was reassuring. He was completely blown and under really professional surveillance. An attempt might be made to put him away before he had a chance to pit himself against Le Chiffre at the tables. The Russians had no stupid prejudices about murder. And then there was this pest of a girl. He sighed. Women were for recreation. On a job, they got in the way and fogged things up with sex and hurt feelings and all the emotional baggage they carried around. One had to look out for them and take care of them. \n \u0027Bitch,\u0027 said Bond\u0027 and then remembering the Muntzes, he said \u0027bitch\u0027 again more loudly and walked out of the room. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554/46083.html","bookId":1283,"book":{"id":1283,"title":"007之大战皇家赌场 Casino Royal","description":"简介： 《007：大战皇家赌场》（Casino Royale）是马丁坎贝尔执导的一部动作惊悚片，为米高梅出品的《007》系列电影第21集，影片根据007教父伊恩弗莱明出版于1953年的第一部邦德小说改编而成，是丹尼尔克雷格担当第六任007后的第一部影片，影片其他主演有爱娃格林、麦斯米科尔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
