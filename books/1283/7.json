{"id":41596,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER 7 - ROUGE ET NOIR","content":"Bond was determined to be completely fit and relaxed for a gambling session which might last most of the night. He ordered a masseur for three o\u0027clock. After the remains of his luncheon had been removed, he sat at his window gazing out to sea until there came a knock on the door as the masseur, a Swede, presented himself \n Silently he got to work on Bond from his feet to his neck, melting the tensions in his body and calming his still twanging nerves. Even the long purpling bruises down Bond\u0027s left shoulder and side ceased to throb, and when the Swede had gone Bond fell into a dreamless sleep. \n He awoke in the evening completely refreshed. \n After a cold shower, Bond walked over to the Casino. Since the night before he had lost the mood of the tables. He needed to re-establish that focus which is half mathematical and half intuitive and which, with a slow pulse and a sanguine temperament, Bond knew to be the essential equipment of any gambler who was set on winning. \n Bond had always been a gambler. He loved the dry riffle of the cards and the constant unemphatic drama of the quiet figures round the green tables. He liked the solid, studied comfort of card-rooms and casinos, the well-padded arms of the chairs, the glass of champagne or whisky at the elbow, the quiet unhurried attention of good servants. He was amused by the impartiality of the roulette ball and of the playing-cards - and their eternal bias. He liked being an actor and a spectator and from his chair to take part in other men\u0027s dramas and decisions, until it came to his own turn to say that vital \u0027yes\u0027 or \u0027no\u0027, generally on a fifty-fifty chance. \n Above all, he liked it that everything was one\u0027s own fault. There was only oneself to praise or blame. Luck was a servant and not a master. Luck had to be accepted with a shrug or taken advantage of up to the hilt. But it had to be understood and recognized for what it was and not confused with a faulty appreciation of the odds, for, at gambling, the deadly sin is to mistake bad play for bad luck. And luck in all its moods had to be loved and not feared Bond saw luck as a woman, to be softly wooed or brutally ravaged, never pandered to or pursued. But he was honest enough to admit that he had never yet been made to suffer by cards or by women. One day, and he accepted the fact he would be brought to his knees by love or by luck. When that happened he knew that he too would be branded with the deadly question-mark he recognized so often in others, the promise to pay before you have lost: the acceptance of fallibility. \n But on this June evening when Bond walked through the \u0027kitchen\u0027 into the salle privée, it was with a sensation of confidence and cheerful anticipation that he changed a million francs into plaques of fifty mille and took a seat next to the chef de partie at Roulette Table Number 1. \n Bond borrowed the chef\u0027s card and studied the run of the ball since the session had started at three o\u0027clock that afternoon. He always did this although he knew that each turn of the wheel, each fall of the ball into a numbered slot has absolutely no connexion with its predecessor. He accepted that the game begins afresh each time the croupier picks up the ivory ball with his right hand, gives one of the four spokes of the wheel a controlled twist clockwise with the same hand, and with a third motion, also with the right hand, flicks the ball round the outer rim of the wheel anti-clockwise, against the spin. \n It was obvious that all this ritual and all the mechanical minutiae of the wheel, of the numbered slots and the cylinder, had been devised and perfected over the years so that neither the skill of the croupier nor any bias in the wheel could affect the fall of the ball. And yet it is a convention among roulette players, and Bond rigidly adhered to it, to take careful note of the past history of each session and to be guided by any peculiarities in the run of the wheel. To note, for instance, and consider significant, sequences of more than two on a single number or of more than four at the other chances down to evens. \n Bond didn\u0027t defend the practice. He simply maintained that the more effort and ingenuity you put into gambling, the more you took out. \n On the record of that particular table, after about three hours\u0027 play, Bond could see little of interest except that the last dozen had been out of favour. It was his practice to play always with the wheel, and only to turn against its previous pattern and start on a new tack after a zero had turned up. So he decided to play one of his favourite gambits and back two - in this case the first two - dozens, each with the maximum - one hundred thousand francs. He thus had two-thirds of the board covered (less the zero) and, since the dozens pay odds of two to one, he stood to win a hundred thousand francs every time any number lower than twenty-five turned up. \n After seven coups he had won six times. He lost on the seventh when thirty came up. His net profit was four hundred thousand francs. He kept off the table for the eighth throw. Zero turned up. This piece of luck cheered him further and, accepting the thirty as a finger-post to the last dozen, he decided to back the first and last dozens until he had lost twice. Ten throws later the middle dozen came up twice, costing him four hundred thousand francs but he rose from the table one million francs to the good. \n Directly Bond had started playing in maximums, his game had become the centre of interest at the table. As he seemed to be in luck, one or two pilot fish started to swim with the shark. Sitting directly opposite, one of these, whom Bond took to be an American, had shown more than the usual friendliness and pleasure at his share of the winning streak. He had smiled once or twice across the table, and there was something pointed in the way he duplicated Bond\u0027s movements, placing his two modest plaques of ten mille exactly opposite Bond\u0027s larger ones. When Bond rose, he too pushed back his chair and called cheerfully across the table: \n \u0027Thanks for the ride. Guess I owe you a drink. Will you join me?\u0027 \n Bond had a feeling that this might be the CIA man. He knew he was right as they strolled off together towards the bar, after Bond had thrown a plaque of ten mille to the croupier and had given a mine to the huissier who drew back his chair. \n \u0027My name\u0027s Felix Leiter,\u0027 said the American. \u0027Glad to meet you.\u0027 \n \u0027Mine\u0027s Bond - James Bond.\u0027 \n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 said his companion, \u0027and now let\u0027s see. What shall we have to celebrate?\u0027 \n Bond insisted on ordering Leiter\u0027s Haig-and-Haig \u0027on the rocks\u0027 and then he looked carefully at the barman. \n \u0027A dry martini,\u0027 he said. \u0027One. In a deep champagne goblet.\u0027 \n \u0027Oui, monsieur.\u0027 \n \u0027Just a moment. Three measures of Gordon\u0027s, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it\u0027s ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon-peel. Got it?\u0027 \n \u0027Certainly, monsieur.\u0027 The barman seemed pleased with the idea. \n \u0027Gosh, that\u0027s certainly a drink,\u0027 said Leiter. \n Bond laughed. \u0027When I\u0027m . . . er . . . concentrating,\u0027 he explained, \u0027I never have more than one drink before dinner. But I do like that one to be large and very strong and very cold and very well-made. I hate small portions of anything, particularly when they taste bad. This drink\u0027s my own invention. I\u0027m going to patent it when I can think of a good name.\u0027 \n He watched carefully as the deep glass became frosted with the pale golden drink, slightly aerated by the bruising of the shaker. He reached for it and took a long sip. \n \u0027Excellent,\u0027 he said to the barman, \u0027but if you can get a vodka made with grain instead of potatoes, you will find it still better.\u0027 \n \u0027Mais n\u0027enculons pas des mouches,\u0027 he added in an aside to the barman. The barman grinned. \n \u0027That\u0027s a vulgar way of saying \"we won\u0027t split hairs\",\u0027 explained Bond. \n But Leiter was still interested in Bond\u0027s drink. \u0027You certainly think things out,\u0027 he said with amusement as they carried their glasses to a corner of the room. He lowered his voice. \n \u0027You\u0027d better call it the \u0027Molotov Cocktail\u0027 after the one you tasted this afternoon.\u0027 \n They sat down. Bond laughed. \n \u0027I see that the spot marked \"X\" has been roped off and they\u0027re making cars take a detour over the pavement. I hope it hasn\u0027t frightened away any of the big money.\u0027 \n \u0027People are accepting the Communist story or else they think it was a burst gas-main. All the burnt trees are coming down tonight and if they work things here like they do at Monte Carlo, there won\u0027t be a trace of the mess left in the morning.\u0027 \n Leiter shook a Chesterfield out of his pack. \u0027I\u0027m glad to be working with you on this job,\u0027 he said, looking into his drink, \u0027so I\u0027m particularly glad you didn\u0027t get blown to glory. Our people are definitely interested. They think it\u0027s just as important as your friends do and they don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything crazy about it at all. In fact, Washington\u0027s pretty sick we\u0027re not running the show, but you know what the big brass is like. I expect your fellows are much the same in London.\u0027 \n Bond nodded. \u0027Apt to be a bit jealous of their scoops,\u0027 he admitted. \n \u0027Anyway, I\u0027m under your orders and I\u0027m to give you any help you ask for. With Mathis and his boys here, there may not be much that isn\u0027t taken care of already. But, anyway, here I am.\u0027 \n \u0027I\u0027m delighted you are,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027The opposition has got me, and probably you and Mathis too, all weighed up and it seems no holds are going to be barred. I\u0027m glad Le Chiffre seems as desperate as we thought he was. I\u0027m afraid I haven\u0027t got anything very specific for you to do, but I\u0027d be grateful if you\u0027d stick around the Casino this evening. I\u0027ve got an assistant, a Miss Lynd, and I\u0027d like to hand her over to you when I start playing. You won\u0027t be ashamed of her. She\u0027s a good looking girl.\u0027 He smiled at Leiter. \u0027And you might mark his two gunmen. I can\u0027t imagine he\u0027ll try a rough house, but you never know.\u0027 \n \u0027I may be able to help,\u0027 said Leiter. \u0027I was a regular in our Marine Corps before I joined this racket, if that means anything to you.\u0027 He looked at Bond with a hint of self-deprecation. \n \u0027It does,\u0027 said Bond. \n It turned out that Leiter was from Texas. While he talked on about his job with the Joint Intelligence Staff of NATO and the difficulty of maintaining security in an organization where so many nationalities were represented, Bond reflected that good Americans were fine people and that most of them seemed to come from Texas. \n Felix Leiter was about thirty-five. He was tall with a thin bony frame and his lightweight, tan-coloured suit hung loosely from his shoulders like the clothes of Frank Sinatra. His movements and speech were slow, but one had the feeling that there was plenty of speed and strength in him and that he would be a tough and cruel fighter. As he sat hunched over the table, he seemed to have some of the jack-knife quality of a falcon. There was this impression also in his face, in the sharpness of his chin and cheekbones and the wide wry mouth. His grey eyes had a feline slant which was increased by his habit of screwing them up against the smoke of the Chesterfields which he tapped out of the pack in a chain. The permanent wrinkles which this habit had etched at the corners gave the impression that he smiled more with his eyes than with his mouth. A mop of straw-coloured hair lent his face a boyish look which closer examination contradicted. Although he seemed to talk quite openly about his duties in Paris, Bond soon noticed that he never spoke of his American colleagues in Europe or in Washington and he guessed that Leiter held the interests of his own organization far above the mutual concerns of the North Atlantic Allies. Bond sympathized with him. \n By the time Leiter had swallowed another whisky and Bond had told him about the Muntzes and his short reconnaissance trip down the coast that morning, it was seven-thirty, and they decided to stroll over to their hotel together. Before leaving the Casino, Bond deposited his total capital of twenty-four million at the caisse, keeping only a few notes of ten mille as pocket money. \n As they walked across to the Splendide, they saw that a team of workmen was already busy at the scene of the explosion. Several trees were uprooted and hoses from three municipal tank cars were washing down the boulevard and pavements. The bomb-crater had disappeared and only a few passers-by had paused to gape. Bond assumed that similar face-lifting had already been carried out at the Hermitage and to the shops and frontages which had lost their windows. \n In the warm blue dusk Royale-les-Eaux was once again orderly and peaceful. \n \u0027Who\u0027s the concierge working for?\u0027 asked Leiter as they approached the hotel. Bond was not sure, and said so. \n Mathis had been unable to enlighten him. \u0027Unless you have bought him yourself,\u0027 he had said, \u0027you must assume that he has been bought by the other side. All concierges are venal. It is not their fault. They are trained to regard all hotel guests except maharajahs as potential cheats and thieves. They have as much concern for your comfort or well-being as crocodiles.\u0027 \n Bond remembered Mathis\u0027s pronouncement when the concierge hurried up to inquire whether he had recovered from his most unfortunate experience of the afternoon. Bond thought it well to say that he still felt a little shaky. He hoped that if the intelligence were relayed, Le Chiffre would at any rate start playing that evening with a basic misinterpretation of his adversary\u0027s strength. The concierge proffered glycerine hopes for Bond\u0027s recovery. \n Leiter\u0027s room was on one of the upper floors and they parted company at the lift after arranging to see each other at the Casino at around half past ten or eleven, the usual hour for the high tables to begin play. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554/46086.html","bookId":1283,"book":{"id":1283,"title":"007之大战皇家赌场 Casino Royal","description":"简介： 《007：大战皇家赌场》（Casino Royale）是马丁坎贝尔执导的一部动作惊悚片，为米高梅出品的《007》系列电影第21集，影片根据007教父伊恩弗莱明出版于1953年的第一部邦德小说改编而成，是丹尼尔克雷格担当第六任007后的第一部影片，影片其他主演有爱娃格林、麦斯米科尔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
