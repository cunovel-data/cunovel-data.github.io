{"id":41605,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER 16 - THE CRAWLING OF THE SKIN","content":"As Bond hurtled round the bend, caressing the great car against the camber with an easy sway of body and hands, he was working out his plan of action when the distance between the two cars had narrowed still further. He imagined that the enemy driver would try to dodge off into a side-road if he got the chance. So when he got round the bend and saw no lights ahead, it was a normal reflex to ease up on the accelerator and, when he saw the Michelin post, to prepare to brake. \\n\\n He was only doing about sixty as he approached the black patch across the right-hand crown of the road which he assumed to be the shadow cast by a wayside tree. Even so, there was no time to save himself. There was suddenly a small carpet of glinting steel spikes right under his off-side wing. Then he was on top of it. \\n\\n Bond automatically slammed the brakes full on and braced all his sinews against the wheel to correct the inevitable slew to the left, but he only kept control for a split second. As the rubber was flayed from his off-side wheels and the rims for an instant tore up the tarmac, the heavy car whirled across the road in a tearing dry skid, slammed the left bank with a crash that knocked Bond out of the driving-seat on to the floor, and then, facing back up the road, it reared slowly up, its front wheels spinning and its great headlights searching the sky. For a split second, resting on the petrol tank, it seemed to paw at the heavens like a giant praying-mantis. Then slowly it toppled over backwards and fell with a splintering crash of coachwork and glass. \\n\\n In the deafening silence, the near-side front wheel whispered briefly on and then squeaked to a stop. \\n\\n Le Chiffre and his two men only had to walk a few yards from their ambush. \\n\\n \u0027Put your guns away and get him out,\u0027 he ordered brusquely. \u0027I\u0027ll keep you covered. Be careful of him. I don\u0027t want a corpse. And hurry up, it\u0027s getting light.\u0027 \\n\\n The two men got down on their knees. One of them took out a long knife and cut some of the fabric away from the side of the convertible hood and took hold of Bond\u0027s shoulders. He was unconscious and immovable. The other squeezed between the upturned car and the bank and forced his way through the crumpled window-frame. He eased Bond\u0027s legs, pinned between the steering-wheel and the fabric roof of the car. Then they inched him out through a hole in the hood. \\n\\n They were sweating and filthy with dust and oil by the time they had him lying in the road. \\n\\n The thin man felt his heart and then slapped his face hard on either side. Bond grunted and moved a hand. The thin man slapped him again. \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s enough,\u0027 said Le Chiffre. \u0027Tie his arms and put him in the car. Here,\u0027 he threw a roll of flex to the man. \u0027Empty his pockets first and give me his gun. He may have got some other weapons, but we can get them later.\u0027 \\n\\n He took the objects the thin man handed him and stuffed them and Bond\u0027s Beretta into his wide pockets without examining them. He left the men to it and walked back to the car. His face showed neither pleasure nor excitement. \\n\\n It was the sharp bite of the wire flex into his wrists that brought Bond to himself. He was aching all over as if he had been thrashed with a wooden club, but when he was yanked to his feet and pushed towards the narrow side-road where the engine of the Citro?n was already running softly, he found that no bones were broken. But he felt in no mood for desperate attempts to escape and allowed himself to be dragged into the back seat of the car without resisting. \\n\\n He felt thoroughly dispirited and weak in resolve as well as in his body. He had had to take too much in the past twenty-four hours and now this last stroke by the enemy seemed almost too final. This time there could be no miracles. No one knew where he was and no one would miss him until well on into the morning. The wreck of his car would be found before very long, but it would take hours to trace the ownership to him. \\n\\n And Vesper. He looked to the right, past the thin man who was lying back with his eyes closed. His first reaction was one of scorn. Damn fool girl getting herself trussed up like a chicken, having her skirt pulled over her head as if the whole of this business was some kind of dormitory rag. But then he felt sorry for her. Her naked legs looked so childlike and defenseless. \\n\\n \u0027Vesper,\u0027 he said softly. \\n\\n There was no answer from the bundle in the corner and Bond suddenly had a chill feeling, but then she stirred slightly. \\n\\n At the same time the thin man caught him a hard backhanded blow over the heart. \\n\\n \u0027Silence.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond doubled over with the pain and to shield himself from another blow, only to get a rabbit punch on the back of the neck which made him arch back again, the breath whistling through his teeth. \\n\\n The thin man had hit him a hard professional cutting blow with the edge of the hand. There was something rather deadly about his accuracy and lack of effort. He was now again lying back, his eyes closed. He was a man to make you afraid, an evil man. Bond hoped he might get a chance of killing him. \\n\\n Suddenly the boot of the car was thrown open and there was a clanking crash. Bond guessed that they had been waiting for the third man to retrieve the carpet of spiked chain-mail. He assumed it must be an adaptation of the nail-studded devices used by the Resistance against German staff-cars. \\n\\n Again he reflected on the efficiency of these people and the ingenuity of the equipment they used. Had M underestimated their resourcefulness? He stifled a desire to place the blame on London. It was he who should have known; he who should have been warned by small signs and taken infinitely more precautions. He squirmed as he thought of himself washing down champagne in the Roi Galant while the enemy was busy preparing his counter-stroke. He cursed himself and cursed the hubris which had made him so sure the battle was won and the enemy in flight. \\n\\n All this time Le Chiffre had said nothing. Directly the boot was shut, the third man, whom Bond at once recognized, climbed in beside him and Le Chiffre reversed furiously back on to the main road. Then he banged the gear lever through the gate and was soon doing seventy on down the coast. \\n\\n By now it was dawn - about five o\u0027clock, Bond guessed - and he reflected that a mile or two on was the turning to Le Chiffre\u0027s villa. He had not thought that they would take Vesper there. Now that he realized that Vesper had only been a sprat to catch a mackerel the whole picture became clear. \\n\\n It was an extremely unpleasant picture. For the first time since his capture, fear came to Bond and crawled up his spine. \\n\\n Ten minutes later the Citro?n lurched to the left, ran on a hundred yards up a small side-road partly overgrown with grass and then between a pair of dilapidated stucco pillars into an unkempt forecourt surrounded by a high wall. They drew up in front of a peeling white door. Above a rusty bell-push in the door-frame, small zinc letters on a wooden base spelled out \u0027Les Noctambules\u0027 and, underneath, \u0027Sonnez SVP\u0027. \\n\\n From what Bond could see of the cement frontage, the villa was typical of the French seaside style. He could imagine the dead blue-bottles being hastily swept out for the summer let and the stale rooms briefly aired by a cleaning woman sent by the estate agent in Royale. Every five years one coat of whitewash would be slapped over the rooms and the outside woodwork, and for a few weeks the villa would present a smiling front to the world. Then the winter rains would get to work, and the imprisoned flies, and quickly the villa would take on again its abandoned look. \\n\\n But, Bond reflected, it would admirably serve Le Chiffre\u0027s purpose this morning, if he was right in assuming what that was to be. They had passed no other house since his capture and from his reconnaissance of the day before he knew there was only an occasional farm for several miles to the south. \\n\\n As he was urged out of the car with a sharp crack in the ribs from the thin man\u0027s elbow, he knew that Le Chiffre could have them both to himself, undisturbed, for several hours. Again his skin crawled. \\n\\n Le Chiffre opened the door with a key and disappeared inside. Vesper, looking incredibly indecent in the early light of day, was pushed in after him with a torrent of lewd French from the man whom Bond knew to himself as \u0027the Corsican\u0027. Bond followed without giving the thin man a chance to urge him. \\n\\n The key of the front door turned in the lock. \\n\\n Le Chiffre was standing in the doorway of a room on the right. He crooked a finger at Bond in a silent, spidery summons. \\n\\n Vesper was being led down a passage towards the back of the house. Bond suddenly decided. \\n\\n With a wild backward kick which connected with the thin man\u0027s shins and brought a whistle of pain from him he hurled himself down the passage after her. With only his feet as weapons, there was no plan in his mind except to do as much damage as possible to the two gunmen and be able to exchange a few hurried words with the girl. No other plan was possible. He just wanted to tell her not to give in. \\n\\n As the Corsican turned at the commotion Bond was on him and his right shoe was launched in a flying kick at the other man\u0027s groin. \\n\\n Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back against the wall of the passage and, as Bond\u0027s foot whistled past his hip, he very quickly, but somehow delicately, shot out his left hand, caught Bond\u0027s shoe at the top of its arch and twisted it sharply. \\n\\n Completely off balance, Bond\u0027s other foot left the ground. In the air his whole body turned and with the momentum of his rush behind it crashed sideways and down on to the floor. \\n\\n For a moment he lay there, all the breath knocked out of him. Then the thin man came and hauled him up against the wall by his collar. He had a gun in his hand. He looked Bond inquisitively in the eyes. Then unhurriedly he bent down and swiped the barrel viciously across Bond\u0027s shins. Bond grunted and caved at the knees. \\n\\n \u0027If there is a next time, it will be across your teeth,\u0027 said the thin man in bad French. \\n\\n A door slammed. Vesper and the Corsican had disappeared. Bond turned his head to the right. Le Chiffre had moved a few feet out into the passage. He lifted his finger and crooked it again. Then for the first time he spoke. \\n\\n \u0027Come, my dear friend. We are wasting our time.\u0027 \\n\\n He spoke in English with no accent. His voice was low and soft and unhurried. He showed no emotion. He might have been a doctor summoning the next patient from the waiting-room, a hysterical patient who had been expostulating feebly with a nurse. \\n\\n Bond again felt puny and impotent. Nobody but an expert in ju-jitsu could have handled him with the Corsican\u0027s economy and lack of fuss. The cold precision with which the thin man had paid him back in his own coin had been equally unhurried, even artistic. \\n\\n Almost docilely Bond walked back down the passage. \\n\\n He had nothing but a few more bruises to show for his clumsy gesture of resistance to these people. \\n\\n As he preceded the thin man over the threshold he knew that was utterly and absolutely in their power. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554/46095.html","bookId":1283,"book":{"id":1283,"title":"007之大战皇家赌场 Casino Royal","description":"简介： 《007：大战皇家赌场》（Casino Royale）是马丁坎贝尔执导的一部动作惊悚片，为米高梅出品的《007》系列电影第21集，影片根据007教父伊恩弗莱明出版于1953年的第一部邦德小说改编而成，是丹尼尔克雷格担当第六任007后的第一部影片，影片其他主演有爱娃格林、麦斯米科尔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
