{"id":41609,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER 20 - THE NATURE OF EVIL","content":"Bond made good progress. When Mathis came to see him three days later he was propped up in bed and his arms were free. The lower half of his body was still shrouded in the oblong tent, but he looked cheerful and it was only occasionally that a twinge of pain narrowed his eyes. \\n\\n Mathis looked crestfallen. \\n\\n \u0027Here\u0027s your cheque,\u0027 he said to Bond. \u0027I\u0027ve rather enjoyed walking around with forty million francs in my pocket, but I suppose you\u0027d better sign it and I\u0027ll put it to your account with the Crédit Lyonnais. There\u0027s no sign of our friend from SMERSH. Not a damn trace. He must have got to the villa on foot or on a bicycle because you heard nothing of his arrival and the two gunmen obviously didn\u0027t. It\u0027s pretty exasperating. We\u0027ve got precious little on this SMERSH organization and neither has London. Washington said they had, but it turned out to be the usual waffle from refugee interrogation, and you know that\u0027s about as much good as interrogating an English man-in-the street about his own Secret Service, or a Frenchman about the Deuxième.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027He probably came from Leningrad to Berlin via Warsaw,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027From Berlin they\u0027ve got plenty of routes open to the rest of Europe. He\u0027s back home by now being told off for not shooting me too. I fancy they\u0027ve got quite a file on me in view of one or two of the jobs M\u0027s given me since the war. He obviously thought he was being smart enough cutting his initial in my hand.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 asked Mathis. \u0027The doctor said the cuts looked like a square M with a tail to the top. He said they didn\u0027t mean anything.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Well, I only got a glimpse before I passed out, but I\u0027ve seen the cuts several times while they were being dressed and I\u0027m pretty certain they are the Russian letter for SH. It\u0027s rather like an inverted M with a tail. That would make sense; SMERSH is short for SMYERT SHPIONAM - Death to Spies - and he thinks he\u0027s labelled me as a SHPION. It\u0027s a nuisance because M will probably say I\u0027ve got to go to hospital again when I get back to London and have new skin grafted over the whole of the back of my hand. It doesn\u0027t matter much. I\u0027ve decided to resign.\u0027 \\n\\n Mathis looked at him with his mouth open. \\n\\n \u0027Resign?\u0027 he asked incredulously. \u0027What the hell for?\u0027 \\n\\n Bond looked away from Mathis. He studied his bandaged hands. \\n\\n \u0027When I was being beaten up,\u0027 he said, \u0027I suddenly liked the idea of being alive. Before Le Chiffre began, he used a phrase which stuck in my mind . . . \"playing Red Indians\". He said that\u0027s what I had been doing. Well, I suddenly thought he might be right. \\n\\n \u0027You see,\u0027 he said, still looking down at his bandages, \u0027when one\u0027s young, it seems very easy to distinguish between right and wrong, but as one gets older it becomes more difficult. At school it\u0027s easy to pick out one\u0027s own villains and heroes and one grows up wanting to be a hero and kill the villains.\u0027 \\n\\n He looked obstinately at Mathis. \\n\\n \u0027Well, in the last few years I\u0027ve killed two villains. The first was in New York - a Japanese cipher expert cracking our codes on the thirty-sixth floor of the RCA building in the Rockefeller centre, where the Japs had their consulate. I took a room on the fortieth floor of the next-door skyscraper and I could look across the street into his room and see him working. Then I got a colleague from our organization in New York and a couple of Remington thirty-thirty\u0027s with telescopic sights and silencers. We smuggled them up to my room and sat for days waiting for our chance. He shot at the man a second before me. His job was only to blast a hole through the windows so that I could shoot the Jap through it. They have tough windows at the Rockefeller centre to keep the noise out. It worked very well. As I expected, his bullet got deflected by the glass and went God knows where. But I shot immediately after him, through the hole he had made. I got the Jap in the mouth as he turned to gape at the broken window.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond smoked for a minute. \\n\\n \u0027It was a pretty sound job. Nice and clean too. Three hundred yards away. No personal contact. The next time in Stockholm wasn\u0027t so pretty. I had to kill a Norwegian who was doubling against us for the Germans. He\u0027d managed to get two of our men captured - probably bumped off for all I know. For various reasons it had to be an absolutely silent job. I chose the bedroom of his flat and a knife. And, well, he just didn\u0027t die very quickly. \\n\\n \u0027For those two jobs I was awarded a Double O number in the Service. Felt pretty clever and got a reputation for being good and tough. A double O number in our Service means you\u0027ve had to kill a chap in cold blood in the course of some job. \\n\\n \u0027Now,\u0027 he looked up again at Mathis, \u0027that\u0027s all very fine. The hero kills two villains, but when the hero Le Chiffre starts to kill the villain Bond and the villain Bond knows he isn\u0027t a villain at all, you see the other side of the medal. The villains and heroes get all mixed up. \\n\\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 he added, as Mathis started to expostulate, \u0027patriotism comes along and makes it seem fairly all right, but this country-right-or-wrong business is getting a little out-of-date. Today we are fighting Communism. Okay. If I\u0027d been alive fifty years ago, the brand of Conservatism we have today would have been damn near called Communism and we should have been told to go and fight that. History is moving pretty quickly these days and the heroes and villains keep on changing parts.\u0027 \\n\\n Mathis stared at him aghast. Then he tapped his head and put a calming hand on Bond\u0027s arm. \\n\\n \u0027You mean to say that this precious Le Chiffre who did his best to turn you into a eunuch doesn\u0027t qualify as a villain?\u0027 he asked. \u0027Anyone would think from the rot you talk that he had been battering your head instead of your . . .\u0027 He gestured down the bed. \u0027You wait till M tells you to get after another Le Chiffre. I bet you\u0027ll go after him all right. And what about SMERSH? I can tell you I don\u0027t like the idea of these chaps running around France killing anyone they feel has been a traitor to their precious political system. You\u0027re a bloody anarchist.\u0027 \\n\\n He threw his arms in the air and let them fall helplessly to his sides. \\n\\n Bond laughed. \\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 he said. \u0027Take our friend Le Chiffre. It\u0027s simple enough to say he was an evil man, at least it\u0027s simple enough for me because he did evil things to me. If he was here now, I wouldn\u0027t hesitate to kill him, but out of personal revenge and not, I\u0027m afraid, for some high moral reason or for the sake of my country.\u0027 \\n\\n He looked up at Mathis to see how bored he was getting with these introspective refinements of what, to Mathis, was a simple question of duty. \\n\\n Mathis smiled back at him. \\n\\n \u0027Continue, my dear friend. It is interesting for me to see this new Bond. Englishmen are so odd. They are like a nest of Chinese boxes. It takes a very long time to get to the centre of them. When one gets there the result is unrewarding, but the process is instructive and entertaining. Continue. Develop your arguments. There may be something I can use to my own chief the next time I want to get out of an unpleasant job.\u0027 He grinned maliciously. \\n\\n Bond ignored him. \\n\\n \u0027Now in order to tell the difference between good and evil, we have manufactured two images representing the extremes - representing the deepest black and the purest white - and we call them God and the Devil. But in doing so we have cheated a bit. God is a clear image, you can see every hair on His beard. But the Devil. What does he look like?\u0027 Bond looked triumphantly at Mathis. \\n\\n Mathis laughed ironically. \\n\\n \u0027A woman.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all very fine,\u0027 said Bond, \u0027but I\u0027ve been thinking about these things and I\u0027m wondering whose side I ought to be on. I\u0027m getting very sorry for the Devil and his disciples such as the good Le Chiffre. The Devil has a rotten time and I always like to be on the side of the underdog. We don\u0027t give the poor chap a chance. There\u0027s a Good Book about goodness and how to be good and so forth, but there\u0027s no Evil Book about evil and how to be bad. The Devil has no prophets to write his Ten Commandments and no team of authors to write his biography. His case has gone completely by default. We know nothing about him but a lot of fairy stories from our parents and schoolmasters. He has no book from which we can learn the nature of evil in all its forms, with parables about evil people, proverbs about evil people, folk-lore about evil people. All we have is the living example of the people who are least good, or our own intuition. \\n\\n \u0027So,\u0027 continued Bond, warming to his argument, \u0027Le Chiffre was serving a wonderful purpose, a really vital purpose, perhaps the best and highest purpose of all. By his evil existence, which foolishly I have helped to destroy, he was creating a norm of badness by which, and by which alone, an opposite norm of goodness could exist. We were privileged, in our short knowledge of him, to see and estimate his wickedness and we emerge from the acquaintanceship better and more virtuous men.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Bravo,\u0027 said Mathis. \u0027I\u0027m proud of you. You ought to be tortured every day. I really must remember to do something evil this evening. I must start at once. I have a few marks in my favour - only small ones, alas,\u0027 he added ruefully - \u0027but I shall work fast now that I have seen the light. What a splendid time I\u0027m going to have. Now, let\u0027s see, where shall I start, murder, arson, rape? But no, these are peccadilloes. I must really consult the good Marquis de Sade. I am a child, an absolute child in these matters.\u0027 \\n\\n His face fell. \\n\\n \u0027Ah, but our conscience, my dear Bond. What shall we do with him while we are committing some juicy sin? That is a problem. He is a crafty person this conscience and very old, as old as the first family of apes which gave birth to him. We must give that problem really careful thought or we shall spoil our enjoyment. Of course, we should murder him first, but he is a tough bird. It will be difficult, but if we succeed, we could be worse even than Le Chiffre. \\n\\n \u0027For you, dear James, it is easy. You can start off by resigning. That was a brilliant thought of yours, a splendid start to your new career. And so simple. Everyone has the revolver of resignation in his pocket. All you\u0027ve got to do is pull the trigger and you will have made a big hole in your country and your conscience at the same time. A murder and a suicide with one bullet! Splendid! What a difficult and glorious profession. As for me, I must start embracing the new cause at once.\u0027 \\n\\n He looked at his watch. \\n\\n \u0027Good. I\u0027ve started already. I\u0027m half an hour late for a meeting with the chief of police.\u0027 \\n\\n He rose to his feet laughing. \\n\\n \u0027That was most enjoyable, my dear James. You really ought to go on the halls. Now about that little problem of yours, this business of not knowing good men from bad men and villains from heroes, and so forth. It is, of course, a difficult problem in the abstract. The secret lies in personal experience, whether you\u0027re a Chinaman or an Englishman.\u0027 \\n\\n He paused at the door. \\n\\n \u0027You admit that Le Chiffre did you personal evil and that you would kill him if he appeared in front of you now? \\n\\n \u0027Well, when you get back to London you will find there are other Le Chiffres seeking to destroy you and your friends and your country. M will tell you about them. And now that you have seen a really evil man, you will know how evil they can be and you will go after them to destroy them in order to protect yourself and the people you love. You won\u0027t wait to argue about it. You know what they look like now and what they can do to people. You may be a bit more choosy about the jobs you take on. You may want to be certain that the target really is black, but there are plenty of really black targets around. There\u0027s still plenty for you to do. And you\u0027ll do it. And when you fall in love and have a mistress or a wife and children to look after, it will seem all the easier.\u0027 \\n\\n Mathis opened the door and stopped on the threshold. \\n\\n \u0027Surround yourself with human beings, my dear James. They are easier to fight for than principles.\u0027 \\n\\n He laughed. \u0027But don\u0027t let me down and become human, yourself. We would lose such a wonderful machine.\u0027 \\n\\n With a wave of the hand he shut the door. \\n\\n \u0027Hey,\u0027 shouted Bond. \\n\\n But the footsteps went quickly off down the passage. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554/46099.html","bookId":1283,"book":{"id":1283,"title":"007之大战皇家赌场 Casino Royal","description":"简介： 《007：大战皇家赌场》（Casino Royale）是马丁坎贝尔执导的一部动作惊悚片，为米高梅出品的《007》系列电影第21集，影片根据007教父伊恩弗莱明出版于1953年的第一部邦德小说改编而成，是丹尼尔克雷格担当第六任007后的第一部影片，影片其他主演有爱娃格林、麦斯米科尔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
