{"id":41613,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER 24 - FRUIT DéFENDU","content":"When he got back to his room he was touched to find all his belongings put away and in the bathroom his toothbrush and shaving things neatly arranged at one end of the glass shelf over the wash-basin. At the other end was Vesper\u0027s toothbrush and one or two small bottles and a jar of face-cream. \n He glanced at the bottles and was surprised to see that one contained nembutal sleeping-pills. Perhaps her nerves had been more shaken by the events at the villa than he had imagined. \n The bath had been filled for him and there was a new flask of some expensive pine bath-essence on a chair beside it with his towel. \n \u0027Vesper,\u0027 he called. \n \u0027Yes?\u0027 \n \u0027You really are the limit. You make me feel like an expensive gigolo.\u0027 \n \u0027I was told to look after you. I\u0027m only doing what I was told.\u0027 \n \u0027Darling, the bath\u0027s absolutely right. Will you marry me?\u0027 \n She snorted. \u0027You need a slave, not a wife.\u0027 \n \u0027I want you.\u0027 \n \u0027Well, I want my lobster and champagne, so hurry up.\u0027 \n \u0027All right, all right,\u0027 said Bond. \n He dried himself and dressed in a white shirt and dark blue slacks. He hoped that she would be dressed as simply and he was pleased when, without knocking, she appeared in the doorway wearing a blue linen shirt which had faded to the colour of her eyes and a dark red skirt in pleated cotton. \n \u0027I couldn\u0027t wait. I was famished. My room\u0027s over the kitchen and I\u0027ve been tortured by the wonderful smells.\u0027 \n He came over and put his arm round her. \n She took his hand and together they went downstairs out on to the terrace where their table had been laid in the light cast by the empty dining-room. \n The champagne which Bond had ordered on their arrival stood on a plated wine-cooler beside their table and Bond poured out two full glasses. Vesper busied herself with a delicious home-made liver paté and helped them both to the crisp French bread and the thick square of deep yellow butter set in chips of ice. \n They looked at each other and drank deeply and Bond filled their glasses again to the rim. \n While they ate Bond told her of his bathe and they talked of what they would do in the morning. All through the meal they left unspoken their feelings for each other, but in Vesper\u0027s eyes as much as in Bond\u0027s there was excited anticipation of the night. They let their hands and their feet touch from time to time as if to ease the tension in their bodies. \n When the lobster had come and gone and the second bottle of champagne was half-empty and they had just ladled thick cream over their fraises des bois, Vesper gave a deep sigh of contentment. \n \u0027I\u0027m behaving like a pig,\u0027 she said happily. \u0027You always give me all the things I like best. I\u0027ve never been so spoiled before.\u0027 She gazed across the terrace at the moonlit bay. \u0027I wish I deserved it.\u0027 Her voice had a wry undertone. \n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 asked Bond surprised. \n \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t know. I suppose people get what they deserve, so perhaps I do deserve it.\u0027 \n She looked at him and smiled. Her eyes narrowed quizzically. \n \u0027You really don\u0027t know much about me,\u0027 she said suddenly. \n Bond was surprised by the undertone of seriousness in her voice. \n \u0027Quite enough,\u0027 he said laughing. \u0027All I need until tomorrow and the next day and the next. You don\u0027t know much about me for the matter of that.\u0027 He poured out more champagne. \n Vesper looked at him thoughtfully. \n \u0027People are islands,\u0027 she said. \u0027They don\u0027t really touch. However close they are, they\u0027re really quite separate. Even if they\u0027ve been married for fifty years.\u0027 \n Bond thought with dismay that she must be going into a vin triste. Too much champagne had made her melancholy. But suddenly she gave a happy laugh. \u0027Don\u0027t look so worried.\u0027 She leaned forward and put her hand over his. \u0027I was only being sentimental. Anyway, my island feels very close to your island tonight.\u0027 She took a sip of champagne. \n Bond laughed, relieved. \u0027Let\u0027s join up and make a peninsula,\u0027 he said. \u0027Now, directly we\u0027ve finished the strawberries.\u0027 \n \u0027No,\u0027 she said, flirting. \u0027I must have coffee.\u0027 \n \u0027And brandy,\u0027 countered Bond. \n The small shadow had passed. The second small shadow. This too left a tiny question-mark hanging in the air. It quickly dissolved as warmth and intimacy enclosed them again. \n When they had had their coffee and Bond was sipping his brandy, Vesper picked up her bag and came and stood behind him. \n \u0027I\u0027m tired,\u0027 she said, resting a hand on his shoulder. \n He reached up and held it there and they stayed motionless for a moment. She bent down and lightly brushed his hair with her lips. Then she was gone and a few seconds later the light came on in her room. \n Bond smoked and waited until it had gone out. Then he followed her, pausing only to say good night to the proprietor and his wife and thank them for the dinner. They exchanged compliments and he went upstairs. \n It was only half past nine when he stepped into her room from the bathroom and closed the door behind him. \n The moonlight shone through the half-closed shutters and lapped at the secret shadows in the snow of her body on the broad bed. \n * \n Bond awoke in his own room at dawn and for a time he lay and stroked his memories. \n Then he got quietly out of bed and in his pyjama-coat he crept past Vesper\u0027s door and out of the house to the beach. \n The sea was smooth and quiet in the sunrise. The small pink waves idly licked the sand. It was cold, but he took off his jacket and wandered naked along the edge of the sea to the point where he had bathed the evening before, then he walked slowly and deliberately into the water until it was just below his chin. He took his feet off the bottom and sank, holding his nose with one hand and shutting his eyes, feeling the cold water comb his body and his hair. \n The mirror of the bay was unbroken except where it seemed a fish had jumped. Under the water he imagined the tranquil scene and wished that Vesper could just then come through the pines and be astonished to see him suddenly erupt from the empty seascape. \n When after a full minute he came to the surface in a froth of spray, he was disappointed. There was no one in sight. For a time he swam and drifted and then when the sun seemed hot enough, he came in to the beach and lay on his back and revelled in the body which the night had given back to him. \n As on the evening before, he stared up into the empty sky and saw the same answer there. \n After a while he rose and walked back slowly along the beach to his pyjama-coat. \n That day he would ask Vesper to marry him. He was quite certain. It was only a question of choosing the right moment. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554/46103.html","bookId":1283,"book":{"id":1283,"title":"007之大战皇家赌场 Casino Royal","description":"简介： 《007：大战皇家赌场》（Casino Royale）是马丁坎贝尔执导的一部动作惊悚片，为米高梅出品的《007》系列电影第21集，影片根据007教父伊恩弗莱明出版于1953年的第一部邦德小说改编而成，是丹尼尔克雷格担当第六任007后的第一部影片，影片其他主演有爱娃格林、麦斯米科尔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
