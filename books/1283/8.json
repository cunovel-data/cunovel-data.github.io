{"id":41597,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER 8 - PINK LIGHTS AND CHAMPAGNE","content":"Bond walked up to his room, which again showed no sign of trespass, threw off his clothes, took a long hot bath followed by an ice-cold shower and lay down on his bed. There remained an hour in which to rest and compose his thoughts before he met the girl in the Splendide bar, an hour to examine minutely the details of his plans for the game, and for after the game, in all the various circumstances of victory or defeat. He had to plan the attendant roles of Mathis, Leiter, and the girl and visualize the reactions of the enemy in various contingencies. He closed his eyes and his thoughts pursued his imagination through a series of carefully constructed scenes as if he was watching the tumbling chips of coloured glass in a kaleidoscope. \\n\\n At twenty minutes to nine he had exhausted all the permutations which might result from his duel with Le Chiffre. He rose and dressed, dismissing the future completely from his mind. \\n\\n As he tied his thin, double-ended, black satin tie, he paused for a moment and examined himself levelly in the mirror. His grey-blue eyes looked calmly back with a hint of ironical inquiry and the short lock of black hair which would never stay in place slowly subsided to form a thick comma above his right eyebrow. With the thin vertical scar down his right cheek the general effect was faintly piratical. Not much of Hoagy Carmichael there, thought Bond, as he filled a flat, light gunmetal box with fifty of the Morland cigarettes with the triple gold band. Mathis had told him of the girl\u0027s comment. \\n\\n He slipped the case into his hip pocket and snapped his oxidized Ronson to see if it needed fuel. After pocketing the thin sheaf of ten-mille notes, he opened a drawer and took out a light chamois leather holster and slipped it over his left shoulder so that it hung about three inches below his arm-pit. He then took from under his shirts in another drawer a very flat .25 Beretta automatic with a skeleton grip, extracted the clip and the single round in the barrel and whipped the action to and fro several times, finally pulling the trigger on the empty chamber. He charged the weapon again, loaded it, put up the safety catch and dropped it into the shallow pouch of the shoulder-holster. He looked carefully round the room to see if anything had been forgotten and slipped his single-breasted dinner-jacket coat over his heavy silk evening shirt. He felt cool and comfortable. He verified in the mirror that there was absolutely no sign of the flat gun under his left arm, gave a final pull at his narrow tie and walked out of the door and locked it. \\n\\n When he turned at the foot of the short stairs towards the bar he heard the lift-door open behind him and a cool voice call \u0027Good evening\u0027. \\n\\n It was the girl. She stood and waited for him to come up to her. \\n\\n He had remembered her beauty exactly. He was not surprised to be thrilled by it again. \\n\\n Her dress was of black velvet, simple and yet with the touch of splendour that only half a dozen couturiers in the world can achieve. There was a thin necklace of diamonds at her throat and a diamond clip in the low vee which just exposed the jutting swell of her breasts. She carried a plain black evening bag, a flat object which she now held, her arm akimbo, at her waist. Her jet black hair hung straight and simple to the final inward curl below the chin. \\n\\n She looked quite superb and Bond\u0027s heart lifted. \\n\\n \u0027You look absolutely lovely. Business must be good in the radio world!\u0027 \\n\\n She put her arm through his. \u0027Do you mind if we go straight into dinner?\u0027 she asked. \u0027I want to make a grand entrance and the truth is there\u0027s a horrible secret about black velvet. It marks when you sit down. And, by the way, if you hear me scream tonight, I shall have sat on a cane chair.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond laughed. \u0027Of course, let\u0027s go straight in. We\u0027ll have a glass of vodka while we order our dinner.\u0027 \\n\\n She gave him an amused glance and he corrected himself: \u0027Or a cocktail, of course, if you prefer it. The food here\u0027s the best in Royale.\u0027 \\n\\n For an instant he felt nettled at the irony, the light shadow of a snub, with which she had met his decisiveness, and at the way he had risen to her quick glance. \\n\\n But it was only an infinitesimal clink of foils and as the bowing ma?tre d\u0027h?tel led them through the crowded room, it was forgotten as Bond in her wake watched the heads of the diners turn to look at her. \\n\\n The fashionable part of the restaurant was beside the wide crescent of window built out like the broad stern of a ship over the hotel gardens, but Bond had chosen a table in one of the mirrored alcoves at the back of the great room. These had survived from the Edwardian days and they were secluded and gay in white and gilt, with the red silk-shaded table and wall lights of the late Empire. \\n\\n As they deciphered the maze of purple ink which covered the double folio menu, Bond beckoned to the sommelier. He turned to his companion. \\n\\n \u0027Have you decided?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I would love a glass of vodka,\u0027 she said simply, and went back to her study of the menu. \\n\\n \u0027A small carafe of vodka, very cold,\u0027 ordered Bond. He said to her abruptly: \u0027I can\u0027t drink the health of your new frock without knowing your Christian name.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Vesper,\u0027 she said. \u0027Vesper Lynd.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond gave her a look of inquiry. \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s rather a bore always having to explain, but I was born in the evening, on a very stormy evening according to my parents. Apparently they wanted to remember it.\u0027 She smiled. \u0027Some people like it, others don\u0027t. I\u0027m just used to it.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I think it\u0027s a fine name,\u0027 said Bond. An idea struck him. \u0027Can I borrow it?\u0027 He explained about the special martini he had invented and his search for a name for it. \u0027The Vesper,\u0027 he said. \u0027It sounds perfect and it\u0027s very appropriate to the violet hour when my cocktail will now be drunk all over the world. Can I have it?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027So long as I can try one first,\u0027 she promised. \u0027It sounds a drink to be proud of.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll have one together when all this is finished,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Win or lose. And now have you decided what you would like to have for dinner? Please be expensive,\u0027 he added as he sensed her hesitation, \u0027or you\u0027ll let down that beautiful frock.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d made two choices,\u0027 she laughed, \u0027and either would have been delicious, but behaving like a millionaire occasionally is a wonderful treat and if you\u0027re sure . . . well, I\u0027d like to start with caviar and then have a plain grilled rognon de veau with pommes soufflés. And then I\u0027d like to have fraises des bois with a lot of cream. Is it very shameless to be so certain and so expensive?\u0027 She smiled at him inquiringly. \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s a virtue, and anyway it\u0027s only a good plain wholesome meal.\u0027 He turned to the ma?tre d\u0027h?tel, \u0027and bring plenty of toast.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027The trouble always is,\u0027 he explained to Vesper, \u0027not how to get enough caviar, but how to get enough toast with it.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Now,\u0027 he turned back to the menu, \u0027I myself will accompany Mademoiselle with the caviar, but then I would like a very small tournedos, underdone, with sauce Béarnaise and a coeur d\u0027artichaut. While Mademoiselle is enjoying the strawberries, I will have half an avocado pear with a little French dressing. Do you approve?\u0027 \\n\\n The ma?tre d\u0027h?tel bowed. \\n\\n \u0027My compliments, mademoiselle and monsieur. Monsieur George,\u0027 he turned to the sommelier and repeated the two dinners for his benefit. \\n\\n \u0027Parfait,\u0027 said the sommelier, proffering the leather-bound wine list. \\n\\n \u0027If you agree,\u0027 said Bond, \u0027I would prefer to drink champagne with you tonight. It is a cheerful wine and it suits the occasion - I hope\u0027 he added. \\n\\n \u0027Yes I would like champagne,\u0027 she said. \\n\\n With his finger on the page, Bond turned to the sommelier: \u0027The Taittinger 45?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027A fine wine, monsieur,\u0027 said the sommelier. But if Monsieur will permit,\u0027 he pointed with his pencil, \u0027the Blanc de Blanc Brut 1943 of The same marque is without equal.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond smiled. \u0027So be it,\u0027 he said. \\n\\n \u0027That is not a well-known brand,\u0027 Bond explained to his companion, \u0027but it is probably the finest champagne in the world.\u0027 He grinned suddenly at the touch of pretension in his remark. \\n\\n \u0027You must forgive me,\u0027 he said. \u0027I take a ridiculous pleasure in what I eat and drink. It comes partly from being a bachelor, but mostly from a habit of taking a lot of trouble over details. It\u0027s very pernickety and old-maidish really, but then when I\u0027m working I generally have to eat my meals alone and it makes them more interesting when one takes trouble.\u0027 \\n\\n Vesper smiled at him. \\n\\n \u0027I like it,\u0027 she said. \u0027I like doing everything fully, getting the most out of everything one does. I think that\u0027s the way to live. But it sounds rather schoolgirlish when one says it,\u0027 she added apologetically. \\n\\n The little carafe of vodka had arrived in its bowl of crushed ice and Bond filled their glasses. \\n\\n \u0027Well, I agree with you anyway,\u0027 he said, \u0027and now, here\u0027s luck for tonight, Vesper.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 said the girl quietly, as she held up her small glass and looked at him with a curious directness straight in the eyes. \u0027I hope all will go well tonight.\u0027 \\n\\n She seemed to Bond to give a quick involuntary shrug of the shoulders as she spoke, but then she leant impulsively towards him. \\n\\n \u0027I have some news for you from Mathis. He was longing to tell you himself. It\u0027s about the bomb. It\u0027s a fantastic story.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554/46087.html","bookId":1283,"book":{"id":1283,"title":"007之大战皇家赌场 Casino Royal","description":"简介： 《007：大战皇家赌场》（Casino Royale）是马丁坎贝尔执导的一部动作惊悚片，为米高梅出品的《007》系列电影第21集，影片根据007教父伊恩弗莱明出版于1953年的第一部邦德小说改编而成，是丹尼尔克雷格担当第六任007后的第一部影片，影片其他主演有爱娃格林、麦斯米科尔...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1554","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
