{"id":74413,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\"Blaire?\" Rush\u0027s concerned tone surprised me and I snapped my eyes open and strained in the darkness to see him walking over toward me. \"Yes,\" I replied. \"I couldn\u0027t find you. Why are you out here? This isn\u0027t safe.\" I\u0027d had it with his big brother role. I could handle things myself. He needed to back off. \"I\u0027m fine. Go back inside and continue your make-out session in our booth.\" The bitterness in my voice was obvious. It couldn\u0027t be helped. \"Why are you out here?\" he repeated, slowly taking another step toward me. \"Because I want to be,\" I replied just as slowly, glaring up at him. \"The party is inside. Isn\u0027t that what you wanted? A honky-tonk with men and drinks? You\u0027re missing it out here.\" \"Back off, Rush.\" Rush took one more step toward me leaving all but an inch between us. \"No. I want to know what happened.\" Something in me snapped and I put both hands on his chest and shoved as hard as I could. He barely stumbled back. \"You want to know what happened? YOU happened Rush. That\u0027s what happened.\" I stormed around him and stalked toward the dark parking lot. One strong hand wrapped around my arm stopping me and I jerked hard trying to set myself free but it was no use.\u0026nbsp; Rush had a firm hold on me and he wasn\u0027t letting go. \"What does that mean, Blaire?\" he asked, pulling me back up against his chest. I squirmed against him fighting back the urge to scream. I hated the way the smell of him made my heart race and my body throb. I needed him to stay at a distance. Not rub his warm delicious body all over me. \"Let. Me. Go.\" I snapped. \"Not until you tell me what your problem is,\" he replied angrily. I twisted in his arms but he didn\u0027t budge an inch. This was ridiculous. He didn\u0027t want to hear what I had to say. That realization made me want to say it. Knowing that what I was going to say would bother him. Mess up his whole friendship idea. \"I don\u0027t like seeing you touch other women. And when other men grope my ass I hate it. I want it to be you touching me there. Wanting to touch me there. But you don\u0027t and I have to deal with it. Now, let me go!\" I jerked free and ran for his Range Rover. I could hide out there until he was ready to take me home. Tears stung my eyes and I ran harder. When I reached his vehicle I walked around to the side and leaned back against it closing my eyes. I had just told Rush I wanted him to grope my ass. How stupid could I be? He\u0027d given me my own room. Offered to let me stay there until my dad got home so I could save money and I\u0027d just given him every reason to kick me out. The locks on the Range Rover clicked and I opened my eyes to see Rush stalking toward me. He was going to take me home and kick me out. He stopped beside me and jerked open the back door. He was putting me in the back. How humiliating. \"Get in or I\u0027ll put you in,\" he growled. I scrambled into the backseat before he could throw me in. But he didn\u0027t slam the door behind me. Instead, he climbed in after me. \"What are you doing?\" I asked, just before he pressed me against the seat and covered my mouth with his. I opened to him with one probe from his tongue. The flick of metal in my mouth was exciting. Tonight his minty taste wasn\u0027t mixed with something else. I could taste him for hours and never get bored. Both of his hands found my hips and he shifted me until one leg was up on the seat with my knee bent and my other one still on the floor. He\u0027d spread me open and then settled between me. His mouth left mine and trailed hungry kisses down my neck.\u0026nbsp; He took a small nip of my bare shoulder causing excitement to course through me. Both his hands found the hem of my shirt. \"Take it off,\" he said as he lifted it over my head and then threw it in the front seat without taking his eyes off my chest.\u0026nbsp; \"I want it all off, sweet Blaire.\" He reached behind me with one hand and had my bra unsnapped in less than a second. He pulled it down my arms before throwing it in the front seat with my shirt. \"This is why I tried to stay away. This, Blaire. I won\u0027t be able to stop this. Not now.\" He lowered his head and pulled a nipple into his mouth. He sucked on it hard and an explosion went off between my legs. I cried out, grabbing his shoulders and holding on. I watched as he stuck his tongue out and ran the metal barbell over my skin. It was the most erotic thing I\u0027d ever seen. \"Tastes like candy. Girls shouldn\u0027t taste so sweet. It\u0027s dangerous,\" he whispered against my skin and ran his nose along my cleavage while inhaling loudly. \"And you smell incredible.\" His lips were once again on mine as one of his large hands covered my breast kneading it gently and then tugging on my nipple. I wanted to feel more too. I ran my hands down his chest and slipped them underneath his shirt. I\u0027d stared at his chest enough to know exactly what it looked like. Now I wanted to know how it felt under my hands. The warm skin that covered his hard muscles was smooth. I ran my fingers over each ripple in his stomach and memorized the feel. I had no promise that this would be more than a one-time event and I wanted it all. Rush reached back with one arm and pulled his shirt off, tossing it aside then went back to devouring my lips with his. I arched closer to him. I\u0027d never been topless with a guy. I wanted to feel his naked chest against mine. He seemed to know what I wanted and he wrapped me up tightly in his arms and pulled me against him. The wetness from his mouth had left my breast cold but the heat from his skin was shocking. I cried out and pulled him closer, afraid he\u0027d move away from me. I had what I\u0027d wanted since I\u0027d seen him out of the porch with that girl. It was me whose legs he was between now. This was my fantasy. \"Sweet Blaire,\" he whispered, pulling my bottom lip into his mouth and sucking on it. I shifted underneath him in an attempt to get his hardness pressed between my legs. I was throbbing and I wanted to feel his erection against me. Rush slipped his hand down to caress my knee and then ran it up the inside of my thigh. I let my leg fall open even further needing him to get closer. The ache was growing and the idea of his hand being near my needy ache made me lightheaded. The moment his finger ran along the silk crotch of my panties I jerked and let out a whimper. \"Easy. I just want to see if it\u0027s as fucking sweet down there as the rest of you,\" Rush said in husky voice. I tried to nod but I couldn\u0027t manage anything other than remembering to breathe. I stared into Rush\u0027s silver eyes as they took on a smoky glow. He didn\u0027t look away from me as his finger slipped inside the lace edges of my panties. \"Rush,\" I whispered, squeezing his shoulders and holding his gaze. \"Shhh, it\u0027s okay,\" he replied. I wasn\u0027t scared. He was trying to ease my fear but there wasn\u0027t any. The excitement and need were too much. I needed him to hurry. Something was building inside me and I needed to reach it. The clawing ache was growing. Rush buried his head in my neck and let out a long heavy sigh. \"This is too fucking much,\" he groaned. I started to open my mouth and beg him not to stop. I needed him. I needed that release I knew was coming. His finger slid over my wetness and my toes curled as my body buckled uncontrollably. Then his finger slid inside. Slowly. I froze, afraid of what this would feel like. The thickness of his finger eased in further and I wanted to grab his hand and push it in harder. This was good. Too good. \"Shit. Mother fucking hell. Wet, hot... so fucking hot. And Jesus you\u0027re so tight.\" Rush\u0027s breathing had gotten heavier against my neck as he said things to me that only excited me more. The naughtier his words were the more my body responded. \"Rush. Please,\" I begged, fighting the urge to grab his hand and force him to bring me relief from the throbbing underneath his touch. \"I need...\" I didn\u0027t know what I needed. I just needed. Rush lifted his head and ran his nose up my neck then pressed a kiss to my chin. \"I know what you need. I\u0027m just not sure I can handle watching you get it. You\u0027ve got me all kinds of worked up, girl. I\u0027m trying hard to be a good boy. I can\u0027t lose control in the back of a damn car.\" I shook my head. He couldn\u0027t\u0027 stop. I didn\u0027t want him to be good. I wanted him inside me. Now. \"Please, don\u0027t be good. Please,\" I begged. Rush let out a rugged breath, \"Shit, baby. Stop it. I\u0027m going to explode. I\u0027ll give you your release but when I finally bury myself inside you for the first time you won\u0027t be sprawled in the back of my car. You\u0027ll be in my bed.\" His hand moved before I could respond and my eyes rolled back in my head. \u0027That\u0027s it. Come for me, sweet Blaire. Come on my hand and let me feel it. I want to watch you.\" His words sent me spiraling over the edge of the cliff I\u0027d been trying so hard to reach. \"RUUUUUUSH!\" I heard the loud cry that came from me as I went falling into complete bliss. I knew I was crying for him, screaming out his name and maybe even clawing at him but I could no longer control myself. The ecstasy was too much. \"Ahhhh, yeah. That\u0027s it. Fuck yes. You\u0027re so beautiful.\" Rush\u0027s words washed over me but they felt so far away. I was limp and gasping for air when my senses came back to me. I forced my eyelids back so I could see if I\u0027d mauled Rush in my wild reaction to what I knew was my very first orgasm. I\u0027d heard enough about them but I\u0027d never been able to make myself have one. I\u0027d sure tried a few times but I didn\u0027t have the imagination for it. After tonight, I had a feeling that issue would no longer be a problem. Rush had just given me enough material to work with and he still had his jeans on. I looked up at Rush who was staring down at me with his finger in his mouth. It took a moment to register exactly what that finger was. The shocked gasp following my realization only made Rush chuckle as he pulled it out of his mouth and grinned. \"I was right. You\u0027re just as sweet in that hot little pussy of yours as you are everywhere else.\" If I wasn\u0027t so spent I\u0027d have blushed. All I could do was close my eyes back tightly. Rush laughed louder. \"Oh come on, sweet Blaire. You just came wild and sexy all over my hand and even left some claw marks on my back to prove it. Don\u0027t go getting shy on me now. \u0027Cause baby, before the night is over you will be naked in my bed.\" I peered up at him, hoping I\u0027d just heard him correctly. I wanted more of this. Much more. \"Let me get you dressed then I\u0027ll go find Bethy and see if she needs a ride or if she found a cowboy to take her home.\" I stretched and then managed a nod. \"Okay.\" \"If I wasn\u0027t hard as a damn rock right now I\u0027d consider staying right here and enjoying the sleepy little pleased look in your eyes. I like knowing I put it there. But I need some more.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fallen-too-far-too-far-1/page-14.html","bookId":1993,"book":{"id":1993,"title":"Fallen Too Far (Too Far #1)","description":"Storyline: Fallen Too Far (Too Far, #1; Rosemary Beach, #1) To want what you’re not supposed to have… She is only nineteen.
