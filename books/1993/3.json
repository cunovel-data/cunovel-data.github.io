{"id":74402,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Even with no windows in the room to tell me if the sun was up, I knew I\u0027d slept late. I had been exhausted but a long eight-hour drive and footsteps on the stairs for hours after I\u0027d laid down kept me from sleeping. Stretching, I sat up and reached for the light switch on the wall. The small bulb lit the room and I reached under the bed to pull out my suitcase.\\n\\n I needed a shower and I needed to use the restroom. Maybe everyone would still be asleep and I could sneak in and out of a bathroom without anyone noticing. Grant hadn\u0027t shown me where one was last night. This was all I\u0027d been offered. Hopefully a quick shower wouldn\u0027t be pushing the limit.\\n\\n I grabbed clean panties and a pair of black shorts with a sleeveless white top. If I was lucky, I\u0027d get in and out of the shower and be cleaning up before Rush made his way downstairs.\\n\\n I opened the door leading into the pantry then walked through the rows of shelves that held more food than anyone could possibly need. I slowly turned the doorknob on the door and eased it open. The kitchen light was off and the only light was the bright sun streaming in through the large windows overlooking the ocean. If I didn\u0027t need to pee so badly I would go enjoy the view a moment. But nature was calling and I had to go. The house was silent. Empty drinks littered the place, along with leftover food and some pieces of clothing. I could clean this up. If I proved to be useful I might get to stay until I could get a job and a paycheck or two.\\n\\n I slowly opened the first door I came to, afraid it could be a bedroom. It was a walk-in closet. Closing it, back I made my way down the hall toward the stairs. If the only bathrooms were attached to bedrooms I was screwed. Except... maybe there was one that people used outside after being in the beach all day. Henrietta had to take showers and use the restroom too. Turning around I headed back to the kitchen and the two glass doors that had been standing open last night. Glancing around, I noticed a set of steps going down and underneath the house. I followed them.\\n\\n At the bottom were two doors. I opened one and life jackets, surfboards and floats covered the walls. I went and opened the other one. Bingo.\\n\\n A toilet was on one side and a small shower took up the other side of the room. Shampoo, conditioner and soap along with a fresh washcloth and a towel was on the small stool beside it. How convenient.\\n\\n Once I was clean and dressed I hung the towel and bath cloth over the shower rod. This bathroom wasn\u0027t used often. I could use the same towel and washcloth all week and then wash them on the weekends. If I was here that long.\\n\\n I closed the door behind me and headed back up the steps. The ocean air smelled wonderful. Once I got to the top, I stood at the railing and looked out over the water. Waves crashed onto the white sandy beach. It was the most beautiful thing I\u0027d ever seen.\\n\\n Mom and I had talked about seeing the ocean together one day. She\u0027d seen it as a little girl and her memories weren\u0027t that great but she\u0027d told me stories about it all my life. Every winter when it was cold, we would sit inside by the fire and plan our summer trip to the beach. We never were able to take it. First mom hadn\u0027t been able to afford it and then she\u0027d been too sick. We still planned them anyway. It helped to dream big.\\n\\n Now, here I stood staring at the waves we\u0027d only dreamed about. It wasn\u0027t the fairytale vacation we\u0027d planned but I was here seeing it for both of us.\\n\\n \"That view never gets old.\" Rush\u0027s deep drawl startled me. I spun around to see Rush leaning against the open door. Shirtless. Oh. My.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t form words. The only naked male chest I\u0027d ever seen was Cain\u0027s. And that had been back before my mom got sick when I\u0027d had time for dates and fun. Cain\u0027s sixteen-year-old chest had nothing on the broad, cut muscles in front of me. He had actual ripples in his stomach.\\n\\n \"Are you enjoying the view?\" His amused tone didn\u0027t escape me. I blinked and lifted my eyes back up to see the smirk on his lips. Dangit. He\u0027d caught me ogling him.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t let me interrupt you. I was enjoying it myself,\" he replied, then took a sip from the coffee cup in his hand.\\n\\n My face heated and I knew I was three kinds of red. Turning back around, I stared out at the ocean. How embarrassing. I was trying to get this guy to let me stay for a little while. Drooling was not the best move.\\n\\n A low chuckle from behind me only made it worse. He was laughing at me. Fantastic.\\n\\n \"There you are. I missed you in bed this morning.\" A soft female coo came from behind me. Curiosity got the better of me and I turned around.\u0026nbsp; A girl in nothing but her bra and panties was snuggling up to Rush\u0027s side and running a long pink fingernail down his chest. I couldn\u0027t blame her for wanting to touch that. I was pretty tempted myself.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s time for you to go,\" he replied taking her hand off his chest and stepping away from her. I watched as he pointed in the direction of the front door.\\n\\n \"What?\" she replied. The confused expression on her face said she hadn\u0027t been expecting this.\\n\\n \"You got what you came here for, babe. You wanted me between your legs. You got it. Now I\u0027m done.\"\\n\\n The cold hard flatness in his voice startled me. Was he serious?\\n\\n \"You\u0027re kidding me!\" the girl snapped and stomped her foot.\\n\\n Rush shook his head and took another drink from his cup.\\n\\n \"You are not going to do this to me. Last night was amazing. You know it.\" The girl reached out for his arm and he quickly moved it out of the way.\\n\\n \"I warned you last night when you came to me begging and taking off your clothes that all it would ever be was one night of sex. Nothing more.\"\\n\\n I shifted my attention back to the girl. Her face was in an angry snarl and she opened her mouth to argue but shut it again. With another stomp of her foot she stalked back inside the house.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t believe what I\u0027d just seen. Was that the way people like this behaved? The only experience I\u0027d had with relationships was with Cain. Although we\u0027d never actually slept together he\u0027d been careful and sweet with me. This was hard and cruel.\\n\\n \"So, how did you sleep last night?\" Rush asked as if nothing had happened.\\n\\n I tore my gaze off the door the girl had gone through and studied him. What had possessed that girl to sleep with someone who had told her it would be nothing more than sex? Sure, he had a body that underwear models were jealous of and those eyes of his could make a girl do crazy things. But still. He was so cruel.\\n\\n \"Do you do that often?\" I asked before I could stop myself.\\n\\n Rush cocked an eyebrow. \"What? Ask people if they slept well?\"\\n\\n He knew what I was asking. He was avoiding it. It wasn\u0027t my business. I needed to stay out of the way so he would let me stay. Opening my mouth to scold him wasn\u0027t a good idea.\\n\\n \"Have sex with girls and then throw them out like trash?\" I retorted. I closed my mouth, horrified as the words I\u0027d just said echoed in my head. What was I doing? Trying to get tossed out?\\n\\n Rush put his cup on the table beside him and sat down. He leaned back stretching out his long legs. Then he stared back up at me. \"Do you always stick your nose where it doesn\u0027t belong?\" he replied.\\n\\n I wanted to get mad at him. But I couldn\u0027t. He was right. Who was I to point fingers? I didn\u0027t know the guy.\\n\\n \"Not normally, no. I\u0027m sorry,\" I said and hurried inside. I didn\u0027t want to give him a chance to throw me out too. I needed that bed under the stairs for at least two weeks.\\n\\n I got busy picking up the empty glasses and bottles of beer. This place needed a cleaning and I could do that before I headed out to find a job.\u0026nbsp; I just hoped he didn\u0027t throw parties like this every night. If he did, I wouldn\u0027t complain and who knows, after a few nights I might be able to sleep through anything.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to do that. Henrietta will be here tomorrow.\"\\n\\n I dropped the bottles I\u0027d collected into the trash and then looked over at him. He was standing at the door again watching me.\\n\\n \"I just thought I\u0027d help out.\"\\n\\n Rush smirked. \"I already have a housekeeper. I\u0027m not looking to hire another one if that is what you\u0027re thinking.\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"No. I know that. I was just trying to be helpful. You let me sleep in your house last night.\"\\n\\n Rush walked over and stood in front of the counter crossing his arms over his chest. \"About that. We need to talk.\"\\n\\n Oh, crap. Here it goes. One night was all I was getting.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I replied.\\n\\n Rush frowned at me and I felt my heart rate increase. He wasn\u0027t about to bestow happy news.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like your father. He\u0027s a mooch. My mother always tends to find men like him. It\u0027s her talent.\u0026nbsp; But I\u0027m thinking you may already know this about him. Which makes me curious, why did you come to him for help if you knew what he was like?\"\\n\\n I\u0027d like to tell him it was none of his business. Except the fact I\u0027d needed his help made it his business. I couldn\u0027t expect him to let me sleep in his house and not explain things to him. He deserved to know why he was helping me. I didn\u0027t want him to think I was a mooch too.\\n\\n \"My mother just passed away. She had cancer. Three years\u0027 worth of treatments add up. The only thing we owned was the house my grandmother left us. I had to sell the house everything else to pay off all my mother\u0027s medical bills. I haven\u0027t seen my dad since he walked out on us five years ago.\u0026nbsp; But he\u0027s the only family I have left. I had no one else to ask for help. I need a place to stay until I can find a job and get a few paychecks. Then I\u0027ll get my own place. I never intended to be around long. I knew my dad wouldn\u0027t want me here.\" I let out a hard laugh that I didn\u0027t feel. \"Although I never expected him to run off before I arrived.\"\\n\\n Rush\u0027s steady gaze was still firmly directed at me. This was information I would have rather no one know. I used to talk to Cain about how my dad\u0027s abandonment had hurt. The loss of my sister and father had been hard on my mother and me. Then Cain had needed more and I couldn\u0027t be who he needed. I had a sick mother to take care of. I\u0027d let Cain go so he could date other girls and go have fun. I was just a weight around his neck. Our friendship had remained intact but I realized that the boy I once thought I\u0027d loved had just been a childish emotion.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry to hear about your mom,\" Rush finally replied. \"That\u0027s got to be rough. You said she was sick for three years. So since you were sixteen?\"\\n\\n I nodded, not sure what else to say. I didn\u0027t want his pity. Just a place to sleep.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re planning on getting a job and a place of your own.\" He wasn\u0027t asking a question. He was working through what I had told him. So I didn\u0027t reply.\\n\\n \"The room under the stairs is yours for one month. You should be able to find a job and get enough money together to find an apartment. Destin isn\u0027t too far from here and the cost of living is more affordable there. If our parents return before that time I expect your father will be able to help you out.\"\\n\\n Letting out a sigh of relief I swallowed the lump in my throat. \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n Rush glanced back at the pantry that led to the room I was sleeping in. Then he looked back at me. \"I\u0027ve got some things to do. Good luck on the job hunt,\" Rush replied. He shoved off from the counter and walked away.\\n\\n I had no fuel in my truck but I had a bed. I also had twenty dollars. I hurried to my room to get my purse and keys. I needed to find a job as quickly as possible. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fallen-too-far-too-far-1/page-3.html","bookId":1993,"book":{"id":1993,"title":"Fallen Too Far (Too Far #1)","description":"Storyline: Fallen Too Far (Too Far, #1; Rosemary Beach, #1) \\n To want what you’re not supposed to have… \\n She is only nineteen. \\n She is his new stepfather’s daughter. \\n She is still naïve and innocent due to spending the last three years taking care of her sick mother. \\n But for twenty-four year old Rush Finlay, she is the only thing that has ever been off limits.
