{"id":74407,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"The house was once again a wreck when I woke up the next morning. This time I left the mess and hurried to work. I didn\u0027t want to be late. I needed this job now more than anything else. My dad had yet to call to check on me and I was pretty sure Rush hadn\u0027t spoken with his mother or my father because he hadn\u0027t mentioned it. I didn\u0027t want to ask him because I didn\u0027t want his anger at my father to be directed at me.\\n\\n There was already a good chance that Rush would be asking me to leave when I got back to his house today. He hadn\u0027t seemed real happy with me when he\u0027d stormed out of my room last night. And I\u0027d kissed him back and sucked on his lip. Oh God what had I been thinking? I hadn\u0027t been thinking. That was the problem. Rush had smelled too good and tasted too good. I hadn\u0027t been able to control myself. Now, there was a good chance I would find my bags on the porch when I got home. At least, I had money to stay in a motel.\\n\\n Dressed in my shorts and polo I made my way up the office steps to the front door. I needed to clock in and get a key to the beverage cart.\\n\\n Darla was already inside. I was beginning to think she lived here. She was here when I left and when I arrived every day. Her small whirlwind personality was scary though. You almost wanted to salute her when she barked orders at you. She was frowning up at a girl I hadn\u0027t seen before. She was pointing her finger and almost yelling.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t consort with the members. That is the first rule. You signed the papers Bethann; you know the rules. Mister Woods came in here early this morning letting me know that his father wasn\u0027t happy with this turn of events. I only have three cart girls. If I can\u0027t trust you to stop sleeping with the members then I have to let you go. This is your last warning. Do you understand me?\"\\n\\n The girl nodded. \"Yes, Aunt Darla. I\u0027m sorry,\" she murmured. Her long dark hair was pulled back in a ponytail and her baby blue polo showcased a very large chest. Then there were her long tanned legs and round butt. And she was Darla\u0027s niece. Interesting.\\n\\n Darla\u0027s angry gaze shifted to mine and she let out a relieved sigh. \"Oh good, Blaire you\u0027re here. Maybe you can do something with this niece of mine. She\u0027s on probation because she can\u0027t seem to stop screwing the members while she\u0027s on the clock. We aren\u0027t a brothel. We are a country club. I\u0027m going to have her ride with you for the next week and you are to watch her closely. She\u0027s going to learn from you. Mister Woods sings your praises. He is very pleased with the job you\u0027re doing and asked me to allow you to work in the dining room at least two days a week. I\u0027m now looking for another cart girl, so I can\u0027t afford to fire Bethann.\" She said her niece\u0027s name with a growl and glared back at her.\\n\\n The girl hung her head in shame. I felt sorry for her. I was terrified of upsetting Darla. I couldn\u0027t imagine being yelled at like that.\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" I replied as she held out the cart keys for me. I took them and waited for Bethann to move toward me.\\n\\n \"Go on with her now, girl. Don\u0027t stand here and pout. I should call your daddy and tell him what you\u0027re doing but I don\u0027t have it in my to break my brother\u0027s heart. So go out there and get some morals.\" Darla pointed to the door and I didn\u0027t wait around any longer. I hurried out the door and down the steps. I\u0027d go get the drink cart ready and wait on Bethann there.\\n\\n \"Hey, wait up,\" the girl called from behind me. I stopped and looked back at her as she ran to catch up. \"Sorry, that was brutal in there. I wish you hadn\u0027t seen or heard it.\"\\n\\n She was... nice. \"That\u0027s okay,\" I replied.\\n\\n \"I go by Bethy by the way. Not Bethann. That\u0027s just what my dad calls me so my Aunt Darla does too. And you\u0027re the infamous Blaire Wynn I\u0027ve heard so much about.\" The smile in her voice told me she wasn\u0027t being mean.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry if your aunt has shoved me down your throat.\" I cut my eyes over at her and her bright red plump lips curved into a smile.\\n\\n \"Oh, I wasn\u0027t talking about my aunt. I was talking about the guys. Woods especially likes you a lot. I hear that you caused a little stir last night at that bitch Nan\u0027s birthday party. Wish I could have seen that but the hired help doesn\u0027t get invites to those things.\"\\n\\n I loaded the cart while Bethy stood there watching me. She was twirling a lock of her long brown hair around her finger and smiling at me. \"So, you\u0027re my only in. Tell me all about it.\"\\n\\n There wasn\u0027t much to tell. I shrugged and walked over to get into the driver\u0027s side once I had the cart loaded. \"I went to the party because I\u0027m sleeping under the stairs at Rush\u0027s until I have enough money to move out which should be real soon. It was a mistake. He didn\u0027t like me showing up. That\u0027s about it.\"\\n\\n Bethy plopped down on the seat beside me and crossed her legs. \"That is not at all what I heard. Jace said that Rush saw Woods touching you and went ape shit.\"\\n\\n \"Jace misunderstood. Trust me. Rush doesn\u0027t care who touches me.\"\\n\\n Bethy sighed, \"It sucks being the poor folks, doesn\u0027t it? The hotties never look at us seriously. We\u0027re just another fuck.\"\\n\\n Was that really the way it was for her? Had she just given in and become the girl they tossed aside? She was too pretty for that. Guys back home would drool at her feet. They might not have millions in the bank but they were good guys from good families.\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t there any attractive guys who aren\u0027t filthy rich around? The crowd that comes here can\u0027t be all there is to choose from. Surely you can find a guy who doesn\u0027t cast you aside the next morning.\"\\n\\n Bethy frowned and shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve always wanted to bag a millionaire, ya know? Live the good life. But I\u0027m beginning to see that isn\u0027t in the cards for me.\"\\n\\n I made my way to the first hole. \"Bethy, you\u0027re beautiful. You deserve more than what you\u0027re getting. Start shopping for a man somewhere else. Find one that doesn\u0027t want you for sex. Find one that wants you. Just you.\"\\n\\n \"Well hell, I may have just fallen in love with you too,\" she replied teasingly and laughed. She propped her feet up on the dash as I pulled up to the first golfers of the morning.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t see a younger guy anywhere. They typically weren\u0027t early morning risers. For a little while I wouldn\u0027t have to worry about keeping Bethy from doing the nasty in the bushes or wherever it was she was doing it while working.\\n\\n Four hours later, when we pulled up to the third hole for the third time I recognized Woods and company. Bethy sat up straight in her seat and the excited expression on her face put me on high alert. She was like a little puppy dog waiting for someone to throw her a bone. If I didn\u0027t like her so much I wouldn\u0027t even bother helping her keep this job. Being her babysitter wasn\u0027t in my job description.\\n\\n Woods frowned when we pulled up beside them. \"Why are you driving Bethy around?\" he asked the moment we came to a complete stop.\\n\\n \"\u0027Cause she\u0027s helping me keep from fucking your friends and pissing you off. Why\u0027d you go and tell Aunt Darla?\" she pouted, crossing her arms over her bountiful chest. I had no doubt every guy standing around us was zeroed in on those big knockers of hers.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t ask her to do that. I asked that she promote Blaire not stick her with you,\" he snapped and pulled his phone from his pocket. What was he doing?\\n\\n \"Who are you calling?\" Bethy asked in a panicked tone sitting up straight.\\n\\n \"Darla,\" he snarled.\\n\\n \"No wait,\" Bethy and I said at the exact same time.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t call her. I\u0027m fine. I like Bethy. She\u0027s good company,\" I assured him.\\n\\n He studied me a moment but didn\u0027t hang up the phone.\\n\\n \"Darla, it\u0027s Woods. I\u0027ve changed my mind. I want Blaire inside four days a week. You can use her on the course on Fridays and Saturdays since it is so busy and she is the best you have but the rest of the time I want her inside.\" He didn\u0027t wait for a response before ending the call and dropping it back into the pocket of his starched plaid shorts. On anyone else those looked ridiculous but a guy like Woods could pull them off. The white polo shirt he was wearing was also immaculately pressed. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if it was brand new.\\n\\n \"Aunt Darla is gonna be mad. She has Blaire babysitting me for the next couple weeks. Who will keep me in check now?\" she asked casting her sultry gaze toward Jace.\\n\\n \"Please man, if you like me even a little, turn your head and let me take her back to the club house for just a few minutes. Please,\" Jace begged as he drank in the sight of Bethy sitting there with her legs up on the dash slightly open so that her crotch was in full view. The shorts we wore were too short and tight to leave a whole lot to the imagination in a position like that.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care what the hell you do. Fuck her if you want. But if dad gets wind of it again I\u0027ll have to fire her. He\u0027s pissed about the complaints.\"\\n\\n I knew Jace wouldn\u0027t stand up for her if she was fired. He\u0027d let her go and move on. There was no love in his gaze only lust.\\n\\n \"Bethy, don\u0027t,\" I pleaded quietly beside her. \"On my night off, you and I will go out and we\u0027ll find some place where there are guys worth your time. Just don\u0027t lose your job over him,\" I was talking so quietly only Bethy could hear me. The others knew I was saying something to her but they didn\u0027t know what.\\n\\n Bethy turned her gaze to me and pulled her knees together. \"Really? You\u0027d go out with me and look for guys? On my turf?\"\\n\\n I nodded and a smile broke across her face. \"Deal. We\u0027re going honky-tonking. I hope you own some boots.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m from Alabama. I own boots, tight jeans and a gun,\" I replied with a wink.\\n\\n She cackled with laughter and put her feet down. \"Okay boys what do you want to drink? We have another hole to get too,\" she said stepping out of the cart and walking to the back. I followed her and we handed out drinks and took money.\\n\\n Jace tried to grab her butt a few times and whisper in her ear. She finally turned around and smiled at him. \"I\u0027m done being your fuck buddy. I\u0027m going out with my girl here this weekend and we\u0027re going to find us some real men. The kind that don\u0027t have a trust fund but have calluses on their hands from good hard work. I\u0027ve got a feeling they know how to make a girl feel real special.\"\\n\\n I had to swallow the laugh that bubble up inside my chest at Jace\u0027s shocked expression. I turned on the cart as Bethy jumped back in beside me.\\n\\n \"Damn, that felt good. Where have you been all my life?\" she asked clapping her hands as I drove off smiling and waving at Woods as we headed to the next hole.\\n\\n We made it through the rest of the course then stopped to restock. No more issues. I knew we might see Woods and his friends again but I had faith in Bethy to stand firm. Bethy had chatted happily about everything from her hair color to the last pregnancy scare they\u0027d had in town with a worker and a member.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t paying attention to the members at the first hole. I was driving and trying to concentrate on Bethy\u0027s endless chatter. Bethy\u0027s muttered \"crap\" caught my attention.\\n\\n I glanced at her and then followed her gaze to the couple on the first hole. Rush was instantly recognizable. The tan shorts he wore and snug pale blue polo shirt looked so out of place on him. It didn\u0027t fit with the tattoos I knew covered his back. He was a rocker\u0027s son and that bled through on him even with preppy golfers clothing on his body. He turned his head and his eyes met mine. He didn\u0027t smile. He just looked away as if he didn\u0027t know me. No acknowledgement. Nothing.\\n\\n \"Bitch alert,\" Bethy whispered. I shifted my gaze from him to the girl with him. Nanette, or Nan as he referred to her. His sister.\u0026nbsp; The one he didn\u0027t like talking about. She was wearing a tiny white skirt that looked like she was ready to go play tennis. She had on a matching blue polo and a white sun visor sat atop her strawberry blond locks.\\n\\n \"You aren\u0027t a fan of Nannette?\" I asked already knowing the answer from her comment.\\n\\n Bethy let out a short laugh. \"Uh, no. And neither are you. You\u0027re enemy number one for her.\"\\n\\n What was that supposed to mean? I couldn\u0027t ask her because we had stopped just six feet from the tee and the brother and sister combo.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t try to make eye contact with Rush again. He apparently didn\u0027t want to make small talk.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re kidding me. Woods hired her?\" Nan hissed.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t,\" Rush replied in a warning tone. I wasn\u0027t sure if he was protecting her or me or just trying to stop a scene. Either way it annoyed me.\\n\\n \"Can I get y\u0027all a drink?\" I asked with the same smile I bestowed on every other member when I asked this question.\\n\\n \"At least she knows her place,\" Nan said with an amused snide tone.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take a Corona. Lime, please,\" Rush said.\\n\\n I chanced a glance his way and his eyes met mine only briefly before he turned to Nan. \"Get a drink. It\u0027s hot,\" he told her.\\n\\n She smirked at me and placed a well-manicured hand on her hip. \"Sparkling water. Wipe it off though because I hate the way it comes out all wet from the water.\"\\n\\n Bethy reached into the cooler and got out the water. I guess she was afraid I might hurl it at Nan\u0027s head. \"Haven\u0027t seen you out here lately, Nan,\" Bethy said as she wiped off the bottle with the towel we were supplied for this reason.\\n\\n \"Probably because you\u0027re too busy in the bushes with God knows who spreading your legs instead of working,\" Nan replied.\\n\\n I clenched my teeth and popped the top off Rush\u0027s Corona. I wanted to throw the drink in Nan\u0027s smug face.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s enough, Nan,\" Rush scolded her lightly. What was she his damn kid? He was acting like she was five. She was an adult for crying out loud.\\n\\n I handed Rush the Corona careful not to look at Nan. I was afraid I might have a moment of weakness. Instead, my eyes met his as he took the bottle.\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" he said and slipped a bill into my pocket. I didn\u0027t have time to react before he was stepping away taking Nan by the elbow. \"Come on and show me how you still can\u0027t kick my ass out here,\" he said in a teasing tone.\\n\\n Nan nudged his arm with her shoulder. \"You\u0027re going down.\" The sincere fondness in her voice as she spoke to him surprised me. I couldn\u0027t imagine someone as mean as she appeared, to be nice to anyone.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go,\" Bethy hissed, grabbing my arm. I realized I\u0027d been standing there watching them.\\n\\n I nodded and started to turn when Rush glanced back over his shoulder toward me. A small smile touched his lips and then he was looking at Nan again telling her which club to use. Our moment was over. If that even was a moment.\\n\\n Once we were out of earshot I looked at Bethy. \"Why did you say that about me being enemy number one?\"\\n\\n Bethy squirmed in her seat. \"Honestly, I don\u0027t know exactly. But Nan is possessive of Rush. Everyone knows that...\" she trailed off and she wouldn\u0027t make eye contact with me. She knew something but what did she know? What was I missing? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fallen-too-far-too-far-1/page-8.html","bookId":1993,"book":{"id":1993,"title":"Fallen Too Far (Too Far #1)","description":"Storyline: Fallen Too Far (Too Far, #1; Rosemary Beach, #1) \\n To want what you’re not supposed to have… \\n She is only nineteen. \\n She is his new stepfather’s daughter. \\n She is still naïve and innocent due to spending the last three years taking care of her sick mother. \\n But for twenty-four year old Rush Finlay, she is the only thing that has ever been off limits.
