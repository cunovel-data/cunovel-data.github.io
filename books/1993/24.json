{"id":74423,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"I didn\u0027t look back and he didn\u0027t call my name again. I headed down the stairs with my suitcase in hand. When I got to the bottom step, my dad came out of the living room and into the foyer. A frown was etched on his face. He looked fifteen years older since the last time I\u0027d seen him. The past five years hadn\u0027t been good to him.\n \"Don\u0027t leave, Blaire. Let\u0027s talk about this. Give yourself time to think about things.\" He wanted me to stay. Why? So he could make himself feel better for ruining my life? For ruining Nan\u0027s life?\n I pulled the phone he\u0027d wanted me to have out of my pocket and held it out to him. \"Take it. I don\u0027t want it,\" I said.\n He stared down at it and then back at me. \"Why would I take your phone?\"\n \"Because I don\u0027t want anything from you,\" I replied. The anger was there but I was tired. I just wanted out of here.\n \"I didn\u0027t give you that phone,\" he said still looking confused.\n \"Take the phone, Blaire. If you want to leave, I can\u0027t hold you here. But please, take the phone.\" Rush was standing at the top of the stairs.\u0026nbsp; He\u0027d bought me the phone. My dad had never told him to get me a phone. The numbness was settling in. I couldn\u0027t feel any more pain. No sorrow for what we might have had.\n I walked over and put the phone down on the table beside the stairs. \"I can\u0027t,\" was my simple reply. I didn\u0027t look back at any of them. Although I\u0027d heard Georgianna\u0027s heels click on the marble floor alerting me that she had entered the foyer.\n I grabbed the door handle and pulled the door open. I would never see any of them again. I\u0027d only mourn the loss of one.\n \"You look just like her.\" Georgianna\u0027s voice rang out in the silent foyer. I knew she meant my mother. She had no right even to remember my mother. Or speak of her. She\u0027d lied about my mother. She\u0027d made the one woman I admired above everyone else seem selfish and cruel.\n \"I only hope I can be half the woman she was,\" I said in a loud clear voice. I wanted them all to hear me. They needed to know there was no doubt in my mind that my mother was innocent.\n I stepped out into the sunshine and closed the door firmly behind me. A silver sports car spun into the drive as I made my way to my truck. I knew it was Nan. I couldn\u0027t look at her. Not now.\n The car door slammed and I didn\u0027t flinch. I threw my suitcase into the back of the truck and opened the door. I was done here.\n \"You know,\" she said in a loud amused tone.\n I would not respond to her. I would not listen to her mouth spew more lies about my mother.\n \"How\u0027s it feel? Knowing you were left for someone else by your own father?\"\n It felt numb. That was the least of my pain. My dad had left us five years ago. I\u0027d moved on.\n \"You don\u0027t feel so high and mighty now, do ya? Your momma was a cheap hussy that deserved what she got.\"\n The calmness that had settled over me snapped. No one was gonna talk about my momma again. No one. I reached under the seat and pulled out my nine millimeter. I turned and aimed at her lying red lips.\n \"You say one more word about my momma and I\u0027ll put an extra hole in your body,\" I said in a hard flat voice.\n Nan screamed and threw her hands up in the air. I didn\u0027t lower the gun. I wasn\u0027t going to kill her. I\u0027d just wing her in the arm if she opened her mouth again. My aim was spot on.\n \"Blaire! Put the gun down. Nan, don\u0027t move. She knows how to use that thing better than most men.\" My dad\u0027s voice caused my hands to tremble. He was protecting her. From me. His daughter. The one he wanted. The one he left us for. The one he\u0027d deserted most of her life. I didn\u0027t know what to feel.\n I heard Georgianna\u0027s panicked voice. \"What is she doing with that thing? Is that even legal for her to have it?\"\n \"She has a permit,\" my father replied, \"and she knows what she\u0027s doing. Stay calm.\"\n I lowered the gun. \"I\u0027m gonna get in that truck and drive out of your life.\n Forever. Just keep your mouth shut about my momma. I won\u0027t listen to it again,\" I warned before turning and climbing into my truck. I tucked my gun back under the seat and backed out of the driveway. I didn\u0027t look to see if they were all huddled around poor Nannette. I didn\u0027t care. Maybe she\u0027d think twice before she fucked with someone else\u0027s momma. Because, by God, she better never talk bad about mine again.\n I headed to the country club. I\u0027d have to tell them I was leaving. Darla deserved to know not to expect me. So did Woods for that matter. I didn\u0027t want to explain but they probably already knew. Everyone knew but me. They\u0027d all just been waiting on me to find out. Why one of them couldn\u0027t have told me the truth I didn\u0027t understand.\n It wasn\u0027t like this was life altering for Nan. Everything she\u0027d ever known hadn\u0027t just been blown to hell. My life had just flipped on its axis. This wasn\u0027t about Nan. This was about me. Me, dammit. Why did they have to protect her? From what did she need protecting?\n I parked the truck outside the office and Darla met me at the front door.\n \"You forget to check the schedule, girl? This is your day off.\" She was smiling at me but her smile vanished when my eyes met hers. She stopped walking and grabbed the railing on the porch of the office. Then she shook her head. \"You know, don\u0027t you?\"\n Even Mrs. Darla had known. I simply nodded. She let out a long-winded sigh, \"I\u0027d heard the rumors like most folks but no knew the whole truth. I don\u0027t want to know it \u0027cause it ain\u0027t my business but if it\u0027s close to what I\u0027ve heard then I know this hurts.\"\u0026nbsp; Darla walked down the rest of the stairs. The commanding little firecracker I knew was gone. She opened her arms when she got to the bottom step and I ran into them. I didn\u0027t think about it. I needed someone to hold me. The sobs came the moment she wrapped me up in her arms.\n \"I know it sucks, sugar. I wish someone would\u0027ve told you sooner.\"\n I couldn\u0027t talk. I just cried and clung to her while she held on tight.\n \"Blaire? What\u0027s wrong?\" Bethy\u0027s voice sounded worried and I looked up to see her running down the steps toward us. \"Oh shit. You know,\" she said, stopping in her tracks. \"I should\u0027ve told you but I was scared to. I didn\u0027t know all the facts. I just knew what Jace had overheard from Nan. I didn\u0027t want to tell you the wrong thing. I was hoping Rush would tell you. He did, didn\u0027t he? I thought for sure he would after the way I saw him looking at you last night.\"\n I eased back out of Darla\u0027s arms and wiped at my face. \"No. He didn\u0027t tell me. I overheard. My dad and Georgianna came home.\"\n \"Shit,\" Bethy said in a frustrated sigh. \"Are you leaving?\" The pained expression in her eyes told me she already knew the answer to that.\n I only nodded.\n \"Where will you go?\" Darla asked.\n \"Back to Alabama. Back home. I have some money saved up now. I\u0027ll be able to find a job and I do have friends there. My mom and sister\u0027s graves are there.\" I didn\u0027t finish. I couldn\u0027t without breaking down again.\n \"We\u0027ll miss you around here,\" Darla said with a sad smile.\n I would miss them too. All of them. Even Woods. I nodded. \"Me too.\"\n Bethy let out a loud sob and running over to me she threw her arms around my neck. \"I never had a friend like you before. I don\u0027t want you to leave.\"\n My eyes filled up with tears again. I\u0027d made a few friend here. Not everyone had betrayed me. \"Maybe you could come to Bama and visit sometime,\" I whispered in a choked sob.\n She pulled back and sniffed. \"You\u0027d let me come visit?\"\n \"Of course,\" I replied.\n \"Okay. Is next week too soon?\"\n If I could\u0027ve managed the energy to smile, I would have. I doubted I\u0027d ever smile again. \"As soon as you\u0027re ready.\"\n She nodded and rubbed her red nose with her arm.\n \"I\u0027ll let Woods know. He\u0027ll understand,\" Darla said from behind us.\n \"Thank you.\"\n \"You be careful. Take care. Let us know how you\u0027re doing.\"\n \"I will,\" I replied, wondering if it would be a lie. Would I ever talk to them again?\n Darla stepped back and motioned for Bethy to come stand beside her. I waved at them both and opened the truck door to climb in. It was time I left this place behind.\n Chapter Twenty-Five\n The sigh of relief I expected when I drove under the first out of only three traffic lights in Sumit, Alabama didn\u0027t come. The numbness had taken over completely on my seven-hour drive. The words I\u0027d heard my father say about my mother replayed over and over in my head until I couldn\u0027t feel anything for anyone.\n I turned left at traffic light number two and headed for the cemetery. I needed to talk to momma before I checked into the only motel in town. I wanted to let her know that I didn\u0027t believe any of it. I knew what kind of woman she was. What kind of mother she was. No one would ever compare. She\u0027d been my rock when she\u0027d been the one dying. Never had I feared that she\u0027d walk away from me.\n The gravel parking lot was empty. The last time I\u0027d been here most of the town had come to pay their last respects to my mom. Today the afternoon sun was fading away and the shadows were the only company I had.\n Stepping out of my truck, I swallowed the lump that had risen in my throat. Being here again. Knowing she was here but she wasn\u0027t. I walked down the path to her grave wondering if anyone had come to see her while I\u0027d been gone. She had friends. Surely someone had stopped by with fresh flowers. My eyes stung. I didn\u0027t like thinking she\u0027d been left alone for weeks. I was glad that I\u0027d had them bury her beside Valerie. It had made the walking away easier.\n The fresh patch of dirt was now covered in grass. Mr. Murphy had told me he would cover it in sod for free. I hadn\u0027t been able to pay any extra. Seeing the green grass made me feel like she was properly covered as silly as that sounded. Her grave looked just like Valerie\u0027s now. The headstone wasn\u0027t as fancy as my sister\u0027s. It was a simple; it had been all I could afford. I\u0027d spent hours trying to decide exactly what I wanted it to say.\n Rebecca Hanson Wynn\n April 19, 1967 - June 2, 2012\n The love she left behind will be the reason dreams are reached. She was the rock in a world that was crumbling. Her strength will remain. It\u0027s in our hearts.\n The family that loved me was no longer here. Standing here looking at their graves it rang home how alone I really was. I didn\u0027t have family anymore. I would never acknowledge my father\u0027s existence after this day.\n \"I didn\u0027t expect you back so soon.\" I\u0027d heard the gravel crunch behind me and I\u0027d known without turning around who it was. I didn\u0027t look at him. I wasn\u0027t ready yet. He\u0027d see through me. Cain had been my friend since kindergarten. The year we\u0027d become something more it was just expected. I\u0027d loved him for years.\n \"My life is here,\" I replied simply.\n \"I tried to argue that point a few weeks ago.\" The touch of humor in his voice didn\u0027t go unnoticed. He liked being right. He always had.\n \"I thought I needed my father\u0027s help. I didn\u0027t.\"\n The gravel crunched a little more as he stepped up beside me. \"He still an ass?\"\n I only nodded. I wasn\u0027t ready to tell Cain just what an ass my father was. I couldn\u0027t voice that right now. Saying it out loud made it real somehow. I wanted to believe it was a dream.\n \"You not like his new family?\" Cain asked. He wouldn\u0027t let up. He would ask me questions until I broke down and told him everything.\n \"How did you know I was home?\" I asked, changing the subject. It would only sidetrack him for a moment but I didn\u0027t intend to stand around long.\n \"You didn\u0027t really expect to drive your truck through town and it not become the number one source of headline news within five minutes? You know this place better than that, B.\"\n B. He\u0027d called me B since we were five. He had called Valerie, Ree. Nicknames. Memories. It was safe. This town was safe.\n \"Have I even been here five minutes?\" I asked still studying the grave in front of me. My mother\u0027s name etched in stone.\n \"Naw, probably not. I was sitting outside the grocery store waiting on Callie to get off work,\" he trailed off. He was seeing Callie again. Not surprising. She seemed to be the one he couldn\u0027t get out of his system.\n I took a deep breath then finally turned my head and looked into his blue eyes. Emotion battled past the numbness I was hugging close to me like a cloak. This was home. This was safe. This was all what I knew.\n \"I\u0027m staying,\" I told him.\n A grin tugged at his lips and he nodded. \"I\u0027m glad. You\u0027ve been missed. This is where you belong, B.\"\n A few weeks ago I\u0027d thought with momma gone I didn\u0027t fit in anywhere. Maybe I had been wrong. My past was here.\n \"I don\u0027t want to talk about Abe,\" I told him and shifted my gaze back to my mother\u0027s grave.\n \"Done. I\u0027ll never bring him up again.\"\n I didn\u0027t have to say anything else. I closed my eyes and prayed silently that my mom and sister were together and happy. Cain didn\u0027t move. We stood there without speaking as the sun set.\n When the darkness had finally settled over the cemetery, Cain slipped his hand into mine. \"Come on, B. Let\u0027s go find you somewhere to stay.\"\n I let him lead me back down the path and to my truck. \"Will you let me take you to Granny\u0027s? She has a guest bedroom and she\u0027d love to have you stay there. She\u0027s all alone in that house. She might even call me less if she has some company.\"\n Granny Q was Cain\u0027s mother\u0027s mother. She\u0027d been my Sunday school teacher all during elementary school. She had also sent us meals once a week when my mom got too sick.\n \"I have some money. I was going to get a motel. I don\u0027t want to impose on her.\"\n Cain let out a hard laugh, \"If she finds out you\u0027re in a hotel room she\u0027ll show up at the door raising hell. You\u0027ll be in her house when she\u0027s done with you. It\u0027s easier just to go to her house now instead of causing a scene. Besides, B there is one motel in this town. You and I both know how many date nights have ended up at that place. Major yuck factor.\"\n He was right.\n \"You don\u0027t have to take me. I\u0027ll go see her myself. You have Callie waiting on you,\" I reminded him.\n He rolled his eyes. \"Don\u0027t go there, B. You know better. Snap of your fingers, babe. Just a snap of your fingers. That\u0027s all it would take.\"\n He\u0027d been telling me that for years. It was a joke now. At least to me it was. My heart wasn\u0027t there. Silver eyes flashed in my mind and the pain broke through the numbness. I knew where my heart was and I wasn\u0027t sure I\u0027d ever see it again. Not if I was going to survive.\n Granny Q wouldn\u0027t let me sit quietly. She wouldn\u0027t let me settle. Tonight I needed peace. Solitude.\n \"Cain. I need this night alone. I need to think. I need to process. Tonight I need to stay at the motel. Please understand and help Granny understand. Just for tonight.\"\n Cain looked out over my head with a frustrated scowl. I knew he wanted to ask questions but he was being careful. \"B, I hate this. I know you\u0027re hurting. I can see it all over your face. I\u0027ve watched you hurt for so many years. It is slowly eating me up. Talk to me, B. You need to talk to someone.\"\n He was right. I did need to talk to someone but right now I needed to worry about dealing internally. I\u0027d tell him about Rosemary Beach eventually. I\u0027d have to tell someone. Cain was the closest friend I had here.\n \"Give me some time,\" I said, looking up at him.\n \"Time,\" he nodded. \"I\u0027ve been giving you time for three years. I don\u0027t see how a little more can hurt.\"\n I opened the truck door and climbed inside. Tomorrow I\u0027d be ready to face the truth. The facts. I could make it... tomorrow.\n \"Do you have a phone? I called your old number the day after you drove off and left me here and it said it was disconnected.\"\n Rush. His face when he\u0027d begged me to keep the phone he\u0027d lied about flashed in my mind. The pain pressed through a little more.\n I shook my head. \"No. I don\u0027t have one.\"\n Cain\u0027s scowl deepened. \"Dangit, B. You shouldn\u0027t be without a phone.\"\n \"I got a gun,\" I reminded him.\n \"You still need a phone. I doubt you\u0027ve ever pulled that thing out on anyone in your life.\"\n That was where he was wrong. I shrugged.\n \"Get one tomorrow,\" he ordered. I nodded although I didn\u0027t intend to get one then closed the truck door behind me.\n I pulled back out onto the two-lane street. I drove the half mile up to the first traffic light and turned right. The motel was the second building on the left. I had never stayed here before. I had friends who had come here after prom but that was all a part of high school I only heard about in the hallways.\n Paying for the night was easy enough. The girl working the desk looked familiar but she was younger than me. Probably still in high school. I got my key and headed back outside.\n The shiny black Range Rover that was parked beside my truck looked so out of place here. The heart I\u0027d thought was numb slammed hard against my chest in one painful thud as my eyes connected with Rush\u0027s. He was standing in front of the Range Rover with his hands in his pockets watching me.\n I didn\u0027t expect to see him again. At least not this soon. I\u0027d made it clear how I felt. How had he known to get here? I\u0027d never told him the name of my hometown. Had my father? Did they not understand I wanted to be left alone?\n A car door slammed and my attention was jerked off Rush to see Cain stepping out of the red Ford truck he\u0027d gotten for graduation. \"I\u0027m hoping like hell you know this guy \u0027cause he\u0027s followed you here from the cemetery. I noticed him on the side of the road watching us a ways back but I didn\u0027t say anything,\" Cain said as he sauntered over to stand slightly in front of me.\n \"I know him,\" I managed to get past the tightness in my throat.\n Cain glanced back at me, \"He the reason you came running home?\"\n No. Not really. He wasn\u0027t what sent me running. He was what had made me want to stay. Even knowing everything we might have had was impossible.\n \"No,\" I said, shaking my head and looking back at Rush. Even in the moonlight his face looked pained.\n \"Why are you here?\" I asked, keeping my distance. Cain shifted more in front of me when he realized I wasn\u0027t going near Rush.\n \"You\u0027re here,\" he replied.\n God. How was I going to get through this again? Seeing him and knowing I couldn\u0027t have him. What he represented would always dirty anything that I felt for him.\n \"I can\u0027t do this, Rush.\"\n He took a step forward, \"Talk to me. Please, Blaire. There is so much I need to explain.\"\n I shook my head and took a step backward. \"No. I can\u0027t.\"\n Rush cursed and shifted his gaze from me to Cain. \"Could you give us a minute?\" he demanded.\n Cain crossed his arms over his chest and took one more step to stand in front of me. \"I don\u0027t think so. It doesn\u0027t seem like she wants to talk to you. Can\u0027t say I\u0027m gonna make her. And neither are you.\"\n I didn\u0027t have to see Rush to know Cain had just majorly pissed him off. If I didn\u0027t stop them this would end badly. I stepped around Cain and walked toward Rush and the direction of my room. If we were going to talk we weren\u0027t going to have an audience.\n \"It\u0027s okay, Cain. This is my stepbrother, Rush Finlay. He already knows who you are. He wants to talk. So we are going to talk. You can leave. I\u0027ll be fine,\" I said over my shoulder and then turned to unlock room 4A.\n \"Stepbrother? Wait... Rush Finlay? As in Dean Finlay\u0027s only child? Shit B, you\u0027re related to a rock celebrity.\"\n I\u0027d forgotten what a fan Cain was of rock bands. He would know all about the only son of Slacker Demon\u0027s drummer.\n \"Go, Cain,\" I repeated. I opened my door and stepped inside. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fallen-too-far-too-far-1/page-24.html","bookId":1993,"book":{"id":1993,"title":"Fallen Too Far (Too Far #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Fallen Too Far (Too Far, #1; Rosemary Beach, #1) \n To want what you’re not supposed to have… \n She is only nineteen. \n She is his new stepfather’s daughter. \n She is still naïve and innocent due to spending the last three years taking care of her sick mother. \n But for twenty-four year old Rush Finlay, she is the only thing that has ever been off limits.
