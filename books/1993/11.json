{"id":74410,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"I finished the last of my peanut butter sandwich and dusted off the crumbs in my lap then stood up. I was going to need to go to the grocery store and buy new food soon. Peanut butter sandwiches were getting old.\\n\\n I was off work today and I wasn\u0027t sure what I was going to do. I\u0027d lain in bed thinking about Rush and how stupid I was most of the night. What did the guy have to do to convince me he just wanted to be friends? He\u0027d stated this more than once. I needed to stop trying to get him to see me as something more. I\u0027d made that jab at him last night. I shouldn\u0027t have done that. He didn\u0027t want to kiss me. I couldn\u0027t believe I\u0027d begged him to.\\n\\n I opened the pantry door and stepped into the kitchen. The smell of bacon met my nose and if Rush hadn\u0027t been standing at the stove with nothing but a pair of pajama pants on then I\u0027d have been completely wrapped up in the delicious smell. The view of Rush\u0027s bare back took away from the bacon.\\n\\n He glanced over his shoulder and smiled. \"Good morning. Must be your day off.\"\\n\\n I nodded and stood there wondering what a friend would say. I didn\u0027t want to break the rules anymore with him. I was going to play by his rules. I\u0027d be moving out soon enough anyway.\\n\\n \"Smells good,\" I replied\\n\\n \"Get out two plates. I make some killer bacon.\"\\n\\n I wished I hadn\u0027t eaten the peanut butter sandwich now. \"I\u0027ve already eaten, but thank you.\"\\n\\n Rush put his fork down and turned to face me. \"How have you already eaten? You just woke up.\"\\n\\n \"I keep peanut butter and bread in my room. I had some before I came out.\"\\n\\n Rush\u0027s forehead wrinkled as he studied me. \"Why do you keep peanut butter and bread in your room?\"\\n\\n Because I don\u0027t want his endless stream of friends to eat my food.\u0026nbsp; I couldn\u0027t exactly say that though. \"This isn\u0027t my kitchen. I keep all my things in my room.\"\\n\\n Rush tensed and I wondered what I\u0027d said to make him mad. \"Are you telling me that you only eat peanut butter and bread when you\u0027re here? That\u0027s it? You buy it and keep it in your room and that is all you eat?\"\\n\\n I nodded, unsure why this was a big deal.\\n\\n Rush slammed his hand down on the counter top and turned back around to face his bacon while muttering a curse.\\n\\n \"Go get your stuff and move up stairs. Take any room on the left side of the hall you want. Throw that damn peanut butter away and eat whatever the hell you want in this kitchen.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t move. I wasn\u0027t sure where this reaction had come from.\\n\\n \"If you want to stay here, Blaire then move your ass upstairs now. Then come down here and eat something out of my motherfucking fridge while I watch.\"\\n\\n He was angry. At me?\\n\\n \"Why do you want me to move upstairs?\" I asked cautiously.\\n\\n Rush dropped the last piece of bacon onto a paper towel and turned off the gas stove top before looking back at me.\\n\\n \"Because I want you to. I hate going to bed at night and thinking about you asleep under my stairs. Now I have the image of you eating those damn peanut butter sandwiches all alone in there and it\u0027s a little more than I can deal with.\"\\n\\n Okay. So, he does care about me in some capacity.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t argue. I went back into my room under the stairs and pulled my suitcase out from under the bed. My peanut butter was inside. I unzipped it and pulled out the almost empty jar and the bag with four slices of bread left. I\u0027d leave this in the kitchen and then go find a room. My heart was pounding in my chest. This had become my safe place. Being upstairs took away my seclusion. I wasn\u0027t alone up there.\\n\\n Stepping back out of the pantry I walked over and put the peanut butter and bread down on the counter. I headed for the hallway without making eye contact with Rush. He was standing at the bar gripping the edges tightly as if he was trying to keep from hitting something. Was he considering throwing me back into the pantry? I didn\u0027t mind staying in there.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have to move upstairs. I like that room,\" I explained and watched his grip only tighten more.\\n\\n \"You belong in one of the rooms upstairs. You don\u0027t belong under the stairs. You never did.\"\\n\\n He wanted me upstairs. I just didn\u0027t understand his sudden change of heart.\\n\\n \"Would you at least tell me which room to take? I don\u0027t feel right picking one out. This isn\u0027t my house.\"\\n\\n Rush finally let go of the death grip he had on the counter and turned his eyes to meet mine. \"The rooms on the left are all guest rooms. There are three of them. I think you\u0027ll enjoy the view from the last one. It looks out over the ocean. The middle room is all white with pale pink accents. It reminds me of you. So, you go choose. Whichever one you want. Take it then come down here and eat.\"\\n\\n He was back to wanting me to eat again.\\n\\n \"But I\u0027m not hungry. I just ate - \"\\n\\n \"If you tell me you ate that damn peanut butter again I am going to throw it through a wall.\" He paused and took a deep breath. \"Please, Blaire. Come eat something for me.\"\\n\\n Like any woman on the planet would be able to turn that down. I nodded and headed for the stairs. I had a room to pick out.\\n\\n The first room wasn\u0027t appealing. It had dark colors and the view was on the front yard. Not to mention it was closest to the stairs and the noise level from the parties would be hard to overlook. I went to the next room and the king size bed was covered in white ruffles and pretty pink pillows. A pink chandelier hung from the ceiling. It was very sweet. Not something I expected to find in Rush\u0027s house. Then again his mother lived here most of the time.\\n\\n I opened the last door on the left. There were large windows that went from the floor to the ceiling and overlooked the ocean. It was gorgeous. The pale blue and green color scheme was accented with a king size bed that looked like it was made from driftwood. At least the headboard and footboard did. It had a very coastal feel. I liked it. No, scratch that. I loved it. I put my suitcase down and walked over to the door that led into a private bathroom. Large white fluffy towels and expensive soaps decorated the white marble. Splashes of blue and green were in the room but for the most part it was white.\\n\\n The tub was a large round one with jets in it. Although I\u0027d never seen one before I knew this was a Jacuzzi. Maybe I had come into the wrong room. Surely this one wasn\u0027t a guest bedroom. I\u0027d want this room if I lived here.\\n\\n Nevertheless, it was on the left side of the hallway. It had to be one of the rooms he\u0027d mentioned. I walked back out of the bathroom. I\u0027d go tell him I\u0027d picked this room and if this one was wrong he\u0027d tell me. I left my suitcase against the wall right inside the door and then headed back downstairs.\\n\\n Rush was sitting at the table with a plate of bacon and some scrambled eggs when I walked back into the kitchen. His eyes immediately lifted to meet mine.\\n\\n \"Did you choose a room?\" he asked.\\n\\n I nodded and walked over to stand on the other side of the table. \"Yes. I believe so. The one you said had a great view is it... green and blue?\"\\n\\n Rush smiled. \"Yes it is.\"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re okay with me staying in that room? It is really nice. I\u0027d want that room if this were my house.\"\\n\\n Rush\u0027s smile widened. \"You haven\u0027t seen my room yet.\"\\n\\n His must be even nicer. \"Is your room on the same floor?\"\\n\\n Rush picked up a piece of bacon. \"No, mine takes up the entire top floor.\"\\n\\n \"You mean all those windows? That\u0027s all one big room?\" The top floor looked like it was made of glass from the outside. I always wondered if it was an illusion or if it was several rooms.\\n\\n Rush nodded, \"Yep.\"\\n\\n I wanted to see his room. He wasn\u0027t offering so I didn\u0027t ask.\\n\\n \"Did you already put your things away?\" he asked, then took a bite of his bacon.\\n\\n \"No, I wanted to check with you before I unpacked. I should probably just keep everything in the suitcase. By the end of this next week I\u0027ll be ready to move out. My tips at the club are good and I\u0027ve saved most all of it.\"\\n\\n Rush stopped chewing and his eyes turned hard as he glared at something outside. I followed his gaze; I saw nothing but the empty beach.\\n\\n \"You can stay as long as you want to, Blaire.\"\\n\\n Since when? He\u0027d told me I had a month. I didn\u0027t reply.\\n\\n \"Sit beside me and eat some of this bacon.\" He pulled out the chair beside his and I sat down without arguing. The bacon did smell good and I was ready for something other than peanut butter.\\n\\n Rush moved his plate over to me. \"Eat.\"\\n\\n I picked up a piece of bacon and took a bite. It was crispy and greasy just the way I liked it.\u0026nbsp; I finished the piece off and Rush nudged the plate at me again. \"Eat another.\"\\n\\n I fought back a giggle at his sudden need to feed me. What was wrong with him? I took another piece of bacon and ate it enjoying the taste.\\n\\n \"What are your plans for today?\" Rush asked once I swallowed.\\n\\n I shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know yet. I thought I\u0027d look for an apartment maybe.\"\\n\\n Rush\u0027s jaw ticked and his body tensed up again. \"Stop talking about moving out, okay? I don\u0027t want you moving until our parents get home. You need to talk to your dad before you run off and start living alone. It isn\u0027t exactly safe. You\u0027re too young.\"\\n\\n This time I did laugh. He was being ridiculous. \"I am not too young. What is it with you and my age? I am nineteen. I\u0027m a big girl. I can live on my own safely. Besides, I can hit a moving target better than most police officers. My skills with a gun are pretty impressive. Stop with the unsafe and too young thing.\"\\n\\n Rush cocked an eyebrow. \"So you really do have a gun?\"\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n \"I thought Grant was just being funny. His sense of humor sucks sometimes.\"\\n\\n \"Nope. I pulled it on him when he surprised me my first night here.\"\\n\\n Rush chuckled and leaned back in his chair crossing his arms over his broad chest. I forced myself to keep my eyes at his face and not look down.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d have loved to have seen that.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t respond. It had been a bad night for me. Rehashing it wasn\u0027t something I was up for today.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want you to stay here just because you\u0027re young. I get that you can take care of yourself or you at least think you can. I want you here because... I like having you here. Don\u0027t leave. Wait until your dad gets back. It sounds like you two are way overdue for a visit. Then you can decide what you want to do. For now, how about you go upstairs and unpack? Think of all the money you can save living here. When you do move out then you\u0027ll have a nice padded bank account.\"\\n\\n He wanted me here. The silly smile that tugged at my lips couldn\u0027t be helped. I\u0027d stay and he was right I could save money. Once Dad got back I\u0027d talk to him and then move. There was no reason to go if Rush wanted me here.\\n\\n \"Okay. If you really mean that then thank you.\"\\n\\n Rush nodded and leaned forward to put his elbows on the table. His silver stare was leveled on me. \"I mean it. But that also means that the friend thing with us needs to remain in full effect.\"\\n\\n He was right, of course. Us living together and getting involved in any way would be difficult. Besides, once this summer was over he\u0027d move off to another house somewhere. I didn\u0027t need that kind of heartache.\\n\\n \"Agreed,\" I replied. His shoulders didn\u0027t ease and his body remained strung tight.\\n\\n \"Also, you are going to start eating the food in this house when you\u0027re here.\"\\n\\n I shook my head. No I wasn\u0027t. I was not a mooch.\\n\\n \"Blaire, this isn\u0027t up for argument. I mean it. Eat my damn food.\"\\n\\n I pushed my chair back and stood up. \"No. I will buy food and eat it. I am not... I\u0027m not like my father.\"\\n\\n Rush muttered something and he pushed back his chair and stood up. \"You think I don\u0027t know that by now? You\u0027ve been sleeping in a damn broom closet without complaint. You clean up after me. You don\u0027t eat properly. I am aware that you\u0027re nothing like your dad. But you are a guest in my home and I want you eating in my kitchen and treating like it\u0027s yours.\"\\n\\n This was going to be an issue. \"I\u0027ll put my food in your kitchen and eat it in here. Will that be better?\"\\n\\n \"If all you intend to buy is peanut butter and bread then no. I want you eating properly.\"\\n\\n I started to shake my head when he reached out and grabbed my hands in his. \"Blaire, it will make me happy to know you\u0027re eating. Henrietta buys the groceries once a week and stocks this place expecting me to have a lot of company. There is more than enough. Please. Eat. My. Food.\"\\n\\n I bit my bottom lip to keep from laughing at his pleading look.\\n\\n \"Are you laughing at me?\" he asked with a small grin tugging at his lips.\\n\\n \"Yeah. A little,\" I admitted.\\n\\n \"Does this mean you\u0027re gonna eat my food?\"\\n\\n I sighed, \"Only if you let me pay you weekly.\"\\n\\n He started to shake his head no and I pulled my hands from his and started to walk away.\\n\\n \"Where are you going?\" he asked from behind me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m done arguing with you. I will eat your food if I pay for my part. That\u0027s the only deal I will agree to. So take it or leave it.\"\\n\\n Rush growled, \"Okay fine. Pay me.\"\\n\\n I glanced back at him. \"I\u0027m going to go unpack. Then take a bath in that big ole tub and then I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t have plans until tonight.\"\\n\\n A frown puckered his brow. \"With who?\"\\n\\n \"Bethy,\" I replied.\\n\\n \"Bethy? The cart girl who Jace messes around with?\"\\n\\n \"Correction. The cart girl that Jace used to mess around with. She wised up and is moving on. Tonight we\u0027re going honky-tonking to pick us up some hard working blue collar men.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t wait for him to respond. I hurried to the stairs and ran up them. Once I reached my new room, I closed my door behind me and sighed in relief. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fallen-too-far-too-far-1/page-11.html","bookId":1993,"book":{"id":1993,"title":"Fallen Too Far (Too Far #1)","description":"Storyline: Fallen Too Far (Too Far, #1; Rosemary Beach, #1) \\n To want what you’re not supposed to have… \\n She is only nineteen. \\n She is his new stepfather’s daughter. \\n She is still naïve and innocent due to spending the last three years taking care of her sick mother. \\n But for twenty-four year old Rush Finlay, she is the only thing that has ever been off limits.
