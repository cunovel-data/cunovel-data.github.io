{"id":74422,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"I was alone. I covered my eyes against the morning sun and looked around the room. Rush wasn\u0027t up here. That was surprising. I sat up and looked at the clock. It was after ten. No wonder he wasn\u0027t up here. I\u0027d slept the morning away. Today we would talk. He was going to let me in. Last night we\u0027d had amazing sex. I needed words now. I stood up and found my discarded shorts lying on the end of the bed. Rush must have brought them upstairs because I remembered leaving them on the stairs last night. I slipped them on and then looked around for my shirt. One of Rush\u0027s tee shirts was folded neatly beside my shorts so I slipped it on and headed downstairs. I was ready to see Rush. The doors on the family side of the hall were open. I froze. What did that mean? They were always closed. Then I heard voices. I walked toward the second flight of stairs and listened. My father\u0027s familiar voice carried up the stairs from the living room. He was home. I took the first step and stopped. Could I face him? Would he ask me to leave? Would he know I\u0027d slept with Rush? Would Nan have her mother hate me too? I hadn\u0027t had time to work through all of this yet. My father said my name and I knew I needed to go down there and face this. Whatever it might be. I forced myself down each step. I made it across the foyer and stopped once I could hear them clearly. I needed to know what I was walking into. \"I can\u0027t believe you, Rush. What were you thinking? You know who she is? What she means to this family?\" It was his mother talking. I\u0027d never met her but I knew. \"You can\u0027t hold her responsible. She wasn\u0027t even born yet. You have no idea what all she\u0027s been through. What HE has put her through.\" Rush was angry. I started to walk to the door but paused. Wait. What I meant to this family? What was she talking about? \"Don\u0027t go getting all high and mighty. You were the one who went and found him for me. So whatever he put her through,\" she spat, \"you started it all. Then you go and sleep with her? Really Rush. My God what were you thinking? You\u0027re just like your father.\" I reached out to grab the doorframe for support. I didn\u0027t know what was coming but my breathing was becoming shallow. I could feel panic rising in my chest. \"Remember who owns this house, mother,\" Rush\u0027s warning was clear. His mother let out a loud cackle. \"Can you believe this? He is turning on me over a girl he just met. Abe you have to do something.\" There was silence. Then my father cleared his throat. \"It\u0027s his house, Georgie. I can\u0027t force him to do anything. I should have expected this. She\u0027s so much like her mother.\" \"What is that supposed to mean?\" the woman roared. My father sighed, \"We\u0027ve been over this before. The reason I left you for her was because she had this draw to her. I couldn\u0027t seem to let her go - \" \"I KNOW that. I don\u0027t want to hear it again. You wanted her so damn badly you left me pregnant with a bunch of wedding invitations to rescind.\" \"Sweetheart, calm down. I love you. I was just explaining that Blaire has her mother\u0027s charisma. It\u0027s impossible not to be drawn to her. And she\u0027s just as blind to it as her mother was. She can\u0027t help it.\" \"ARGH! Will that woman never leave me alone? Will she always ruin my life? She\u0027s gone for crying out loud. I have the man I love back and our daughter finally has her father and now this. You go and sleep with this, this girl!\" My body was numb. I couldn\u0027t move. I couldn\u0027t take deep breaths. I was still dreaming. That was it. I hadn\u0027t woken up yet. I closed my eyes tightly forcing myself to wake up from this sick and twisted dream. \"One more word against her and I will have you leave.\" Rush\u0027s tone was cold and hard. \"Georgie, honey, please calm down. Blaire is a good girl. Her being here isn\u0027t the end of the world. She needs somewhere to stay. I explained this to you already. I know you hate Rebecca but she was your best friend. The two of you had been friends since you were kids. Until I came along and ruined everything the two of you were like sisters. This is her daughter. Have some compassion.\" No. NO. No. No. No. I did not just hear that. This is not real. My mother would never have broken up someone\u0027s wedding. She would have never had my dad leave a woman who was pregnant with his child. My mother was a sweet compassionate woman. She would never, ever let that happen. I couldn\u0027t stand here and listen to them talk about her that way. They had it all wrong. They didn\u0027t know her. My father had been gone so long he\u0027d forgotten what really happened. I let go of the death grip I had on the door frame and stalked into the room where they were disgracing my mother\u0027s name. \"NO! Shut up all of you,\" I yelled. The room went silent. I found my father and leveled my angry glare on him. No one else in here mattered right now. Not the woman who continued to spit lies about my mother or the man I thought I loved. The one I\u0027d given my body to. The one who had been lying to me. \"Blaire,\" Rush\u0027s voice sounded far away. I held out my hand to stop him. I didn\u0027t want him near me. \"You,\" I pointed my finger at my father. \"You are just letting them lie about my mother,\" I screamed. I didn\u0027t care if I looked crazy. I hated them all right now. \"Blaire let me explain - \" \"SHUT UP!\" I roared. \"My sister, my other half, died. She died, Dad. In a car on her way to the store with YOU.\u0026nbsp; It was like my soul had been taken from me and torn in two. Losing her was unbearable. I watched my mother wail and cry and mourn and then I watched my father walk away. Never to return. While his daughter and wife were trying to pick up the pieces of their world without Valerie in it. Then my mother gets sick. I call you but you don\u0027t answer. So, I get an extra job after school and I start making payments for mom\u0027s medical care. I do nothing but care for my mother and go to school. Except my senior year, she gets so sick that I have to drop out. Take my GED and be done with it. Because I had the only person on the planet who loved me dying as I sat and watched helplessly. I held her hand while she took her last breath. I arranged her funeral. I watched them lower her into the ground. You never once called. Not once. Then I had to sell the house Gran left us and everything of value in it just to pay off medical bills.\" I stopped and took a loud heaving breath and a sob escaped me. Two arms wrapped around me and I screamed, slinging my arms and moving away. \"DON\u0027T TOUCH ME!\" I didn\u0027t want him touching me. He had lied to me. He knew this and he had lied to me. \"Now I\u0027m being forced to hear you talk about my mother who was a saint. Do you hear me? She was a saint! You are all liars. If anyone is guilty of this bullshit I hear pouring out of your mouth it is that man.\" I pointed at my father. I couldn\u0027t call him that anymore. Not now. \"He is the liar. He isn\u0027t worth the dirt beneath my feet. If Nan is his daughter. If you were pregnant.\" I swung my eyes to the woman I had yet to look at and the words froze on my lips. I remembered her. I staggered back and shook my head. No. This was not what it looked like. \"Who are you?\" I asked as the memories of that face slowly came back to me. \"Careful how you answer that,\" Rush\u0027s tight voice came from behind me. He was still close to me. Her eyes shifted from me to my father then back to me. \"You know who I am Blaire. We\u0027ve met before.\" \"You came to my house. You... you made my mother cry.\" The woman rolled her eyes. \"Last warning, mother,\" Rush said. \"Nan wanted to meet her father. So I brought her to him. She got to see his nice little family with pretty, blonde twin daughters he loved and an equally perfect wife. I was tired of having to tell my daughter she didn\u0027t have a father. She knew she did. So I showed her just what he had chosen instead of her. She didn\u0027t ask about him again until much later in life.\" The little girl my age that had stood holding her mother\u0027s hand tightly and studying me as I stood at the door. It had been Nan. My stomach rolled. What had my father done? \"Blaire please look at me.\" Rush\u0027s desperate voice came from behind me but I couldn\u0027t acknowledge him. He knew all this. This had been Nan\u0027s big secret. He had protected it for her. Did he not see this was my secret too? He was my father and I knew nothing. Woods\u0027 words rang in my head. \"If he has to choose between you and Nan he will choose Nan.\" He knew then that Rush had chosen Nan. Everyone in this town knew the secret but me. They all knew who I was but I didn\u0027t. \"I was engaged to Georgianna. She was pregnant with Nan. Your mother came to visit her. She was like no one I\u0027d ever met. She was addictive. I couldn\u0027t seem to stay away from her. Georgianna was still pinning over Dean and Rush was still visiting his dad every other weekend. I expected Georgie to go to Dean the minute he decided he wanted a family. I wasn\u0027t even sure Nan was mine. Your mother was innocent and fun. She wasn\u0027t into rockers and she made me laugh. I pursued her and she ignored me. Then I lied to her. I told her Georgie was pregnant with another of Dean\u0027s kids. She felt sorry for me. I somehow convinced her to run away with me. To throw away the friendship she\u0027d had all her life.\" I pressed my hands over my ears to block out my dad\u0027s words. I couldn\u0027t listen to this. It was all lies. This sick world they lived in wasn\u0027t for me. I wanted to go home. Back to Alabama. Back to what I understood. Where money and rock stars weren\u0027t an issue. \"Stop. I don\u0027t want to hear it. I just want my things. I just want to leave.\" The sob that followed couldn\u0027t be helped. My world and what I\u0027d known of it had just been blown to a million pieces. I needed to go sit by my mother\u0027s grave and talk to her. I wanted to go home. \"Baby, please talk to me. Please.\" Rush was behind\u0026nbsp; me again. I was too tired to push him away. I moved away from him instead. I would not look at him. \"I can\u0027t look at you. I don\u0027t want to talk to you. I just want my things. I want to go home.\" \"Blaire, honey, there is no home.\" My dad\u0027s voice grated on my nerves. I lifted my eyes and glared at him. All the pain and bitterness I\u0027d kept from creeping in when he left us had consumed me. \"My mother and my sister\u0027s graves are home. I want to be near them. I\u0027ve stood here and listened to y\u0027all tell me my mother was someone who I know she wasn\u0027t. She would have never done what you\u0027re accusing her of. Stay here with your family, Abe. I\u0027m sure they will love you as much as your last one did. Try not to kill any of them,\" I spat. Georgianna\u0027s loud gasp was the last thing I heard before I left the room. I wanted to leave but I needed my purse and my keys. I ran up the stairs and threw everything I could back into my luggage and slammed it shut. I swung my purse strap over my shoulder and turned to the door to see Rush standing there watching me. His face was pale and his eyes were blood shot. I closed my eyes. I did not care that he was upset. He should be. He\u0027d lied to me. He\u0027d betrayed me. \"You can\u0027t leave me,\" he said in a hoarse whisper. \"Watch me,\" I replied in a cold flat voice. \"Blaire, you didn\u0027t let me explain. I was going to tell you everything today. They came home last night and I panicked. I needed to tell you first. He slammed his fist against the door frame. \"You were not supposed to find out that way. Not like that. God not like that.\" He sounded truly upset. I couldn\u0027t let the tugging at my heart from the look on his face get to me. I would be an idiot if I did. Besides, his sister... Nan was his sister. No wonder he\u0027d grown up protecting her. She\u0027d been the child without a dad. I swallowed the bile in my throat. My dad was a horrible man. \"I can\u0027t stay here. I can\u0027t see you. You represent the pain and betrayal of not just me but my mom.\" I shook my head. \"Whatever we had is over. It died the minute I walked downstairs and realized the world I\u0027d always known was a lie.\" Rush dropped his hands from the doorframe and his shoulders sagged as he hung his head. He didn\u0027t say anything. He just stepped back so I could get out. The little heart that I had left in tact shattered from his defeated look. There was no other way. We were tainted.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fallen-too-far-too-far-1/page-23.html","bookId":1993,"book":{"id":1993,"title":"Fallen Too Far (Too Far #1)","description":"Storyline: Fallen Too Far (Too Far, #1; Rosemary Beach, #1) To want what you’re not supposed to have… She is only nineteen.
