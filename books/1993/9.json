Now that I knew how good his kisses were and how nice it felt to have his hands on me, I wasn\u0027t sure I could handle seeing him doing that to someone else. It was ridiculous. But it was true.\n I opened the door and stepped inside. Sexy music was playing loudly over the sound system that was piped into every room. Well, every room but mine. I started to the kitchen when I heard a female moaning. My stomach knotted up. I tried to ignore it but my feet had firmly planted themselves on the marble floor. I couldn\u0027t move.\n \"Yes, Rush, baby, just like that. Harder. Suck it harder,\" she cried out. I was instantly jealous and that just made me mad. I shouldn\u0027t care. He had kissed me once and been so disgusted he\u0027d cursed and taken off running.\n I was moving toward the sound even thought I knew it was something I did not want to see. It was like a train wreck. I couldn\u0027t not go see it even if I didn\u0027t want it seared into my brain.\n \"Mmmmm yes, please touch me,\" she begged. I cringed but I kept moving in that direction. Stepping into the living room, I found them on the couch. Her top was completely off and one of her nipples was in his mouth as his hand played between her legs. I couldn\u0027t watch this. I needed to get out of here. Now.\n Spinning around, I hurried for the front door, not caring if I was quiet or not. I\u0027d be in my truck and out of the driveway before either of them calmed down enough to realize they\u0027d been seen. He had been going at it right there on the couch for anyone to walk in and see. He had known I would be home any moment. The fact was, he\u0027d wanted me to see them. He was reminding me that he was something I could never experience. Right now, I never wanted to.\n I drove through town angry at myself for wasting gas. I needed to save my money. I searched for a pay phone but there wasn\u0027t one to be found anywhere. The days of payphones were long gone. If you didn\u0027t have a cellphone you were screwed. I wasn\u0027t sure who I would call anyway. I could call Cain. I hadn\u0027t spoken to him since I left last week. Normally we talked at least once a week. But without a phone we couldn\u0027t do that.\n I had Grant\u0027s number tucked away in my luggage. But then why would I call him? That would be odd. I really had nothing to say to him. I pulled over into the parking lot of the one and only coffee shop in town and parked the truck. I could go drink some coffee and look at magazines for a few hours. Maybe by then Rush would be done with his fuck fest downstairs.\n If he\u0027d been trying to send me a message I had received it loud and clear. Not that I needed one. I\u0027d already resigned myself to the fact that guys with money were not for me. I liked the idea of finding a good guy with a regular job. One that would appreciate my red dress and silver heels.\n I jumped down out of my truck and started toward the coffee shop when I saw Bethy inside with Jace. They were in a heated discussion at a table in the far back corner but I could see them through the window. At least she had brought him some place public. I would hope for the best with her and leave it alone. I wasn\u0027t the girl\u0027s mother. She was more than likely older than me. At least she looked older. She could make up her own mind who she wanted to waste her time with. The salty sea air tickled my nose. I crossed the street and headed to the public beach instead. I could be alone there.\n The waves crashing against the dark shore was soothing. So I walked. I remembered my mother. I even allowed myself to remember my sister; it was something I rarely did because the pain was too much at times. Tonight, I wanted that distraction. I needed to remember I\u0027d suffered far worse than some stupid attraction to a guy that was absolutely not my type at all. I let memories of better days flood my thoughts... and I walked.\n When I pulled the truck back into Rush\u0027s driveway it was after midnight and there were no cars outside. Whoever had been here was now gone. I closed the door to my truck and headed up the stairs. The front light was on making the house loom large and intimidating in the dark sky. Just like Rush.\n The door opened before I reached it and Rush stood there filling up the entry. He was here to tell me to leave. I was expecting this anyway. I didn\u0027t even flinch. Instead, I looked around for my suitcase.\n \"Where have you been?\" he asked in a deep husky voice.\n I swung my gaze back to him. \"What does it matter?\"\n He took a step outside the door closing the small amount of space between us. \"Because I was worried.\"\n He was worried? I let out a sigh and tucked the hair that kept blowing in my face behind my ear. \"I find that real hard to believe. You were too busy with your company for the night to notice much of anything.\" I couldn\u0027t keep the bitterness from dripping off my tongue.\n \"You came in earlier than I expected. I didn\u0027t mean for you to witness that.\"\n Like that made it better. I nodded and shifted my feet. \"I came home the same time I do every night. I think you wanted me to see you. Why, I\u0027m not sure. I\u0027m not harboring feelings for you, Rush. I just need a place to stay for a few more days. I\u0027ll be moving out of your house and life real soon.\"\n He muttered a curse then glared up at the sky a moment before looking back at me. \"There are things about me you don\u0027t know. I\u0027m not one of those guys you can wrap around your finger. I have baggage. Lots of it. Too much for someone like you. I expected someone so different considering I\u0027ve met your father. You\u0027re nothing like him. You\u0027re everything a guy like me should stay away from. Because I\u0027m not right for you.\"\n I let out a hard laugh. That was the worst excuse for his behavior I\u0027d ever heard. \"Really? That\u0027s the best you\u0027ve got? I never asked you for anything more than a room. I don\u0027t expect you to want me. I never did. I am aware that you and I are in two different playing fields. Your league is one I will never measure up to. I\u0027m not the right bloodlines. I wear cheap red dresses and I have a fond connection to a pair of silver heels because my mother wore them on her wedding day. I don\u0027t need designer things. And YOU are designer, Rush.\"\n Rush reached for my hand and pulled me inside. Without a word, he pushed me up against the wall and caged me in with both his hands pressed flat against the wall beside my head. \"I\u0027m not designer. Get that through your head. I can\u0027t touch you. I want to so damn bad it hurts like a motherfucker but I can\u0027t. I won\u0027t mess you up. You\u0027re... you\u0027re perfect and untouched. And in the end you would never forgive me.\"\n My heart pounded against my chest painfully. The sorrow in his eyes wasn\u0027t something I had been able to see outside. In here I could see emotion in those silver depths. His forehead was creased as if something was hurting him.\n \"What if I want you to touch me? Maybe I\u0027m not so untouched. Maybe I\u0027m already tainted.\" My body was pretty much untouched but staring up into Rush\u0027s eyes I wanted to ease his ache. I didn\u0027t want him to stay away from me. I wanted to make him smile. That beautiful face shouldn\u0027t look so haunted.\n He ran a finger down the side of my face and traced the curve of my ear then brushed his thumb over my chin. \"I\u0027ve been with a lot of girls, Blaire. Trust me, I\u0027ve never met one as fucking perfect as you. The innocence in your eyes screams at me. I want to peel every inch of your clothing off and bury myself inside you but I can\u0027t. You saw me tonight. I\u0027m a screwed up sick bastard. I can\u0027t touch you.\"\n I had seen him tonight. I\u0027d seen him the other night too. He screwed lots of girls, but me he didn\u0027t want to touch. He thought I was too perfect. I was on a pedestal and he wanted to keep me there. Maybe he should. I couldn\u0027t sleep with him and not give him a piece of my heart. He was already weaseling his way in. If I let him have my body he could hurt me in a way no one had ever been able to. My guard would be down.\n \"Okay,\" I said. I wasn\u0027t going to argue. This was right. \"Can we at least be friends? I don\u0027t want you to hate me. I\u0027d like to be friends.\" I sounded pathetic. I was so lonely I\u0027d stooped to begging for friends.\n He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. \"I\u0027ll be your friend. I\u0027ll try my damnedest to be your friend but I have to be careful. I can\u0027t get too close. You make me want things I can\u0027t have. That sweet little body of yours feels too incredible tucked underneath me,\" he dropped his voice and lowered his mouth to my ear, \"and the way you taste. It\u0027s addictive. I dream about it. I fantasize about it. I know you\u0027ll be just as delicious in... other... places.\"\n I leaned into him and closed my eyes as his breathing grew heavy in my ear. \"We can\u0027t. Fuck me. We can\u0027t. Friends, sweet Blaire. Just friends,\" he whispered then pushed away from me and stalked toward the stairs. I leaned back against the wall and watched him walk away. I wasn\u0027t ready to move just yet. My body was sizzling from his words and his closeness.\n \"I don\u0027t want you under those damn stairs. I hate it. But I can\u0027t move you up here. I\u0027ll never be able to stay away from you. I need you safely tucked away,\" he said without looking back at me. His hands gripped the railing on the staircase until his knuckles turned white. He stood there one more minute before shoving himself off and running the rest of the way up the stairs. When I heard a door slam I sunk to the floor.\n \"Oh, Rush. How are we going to do this? I need a distraction,\" I whispered into the empty foyer. I needed to find someone else to focus on. Someone that wasn\u0027t Rush. Someone that was available. It was the only way I was going to keep from falling too far. Rush was dangerous to my heart. If we were going to be friends then I needed to find someone else to focus my attention on. And fast. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/fallen-too-far-too-far-1/page-9.html","bookId":1993,"book":{"id":1993,"title":"Fallen Too Far (Too Far #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Fallen Too Far (Too Far, #1; Rosemary Beach, #1) \n To want what you’re not supposed to have… \n She is only nineteen. \n She is his new stepfather’s daughter. \n She is still naïve and innocent due to spending the last three years taking care of her sick mother. \n But for twenty-four year old Rush Finlay, she is the only thing that has ever been off limits.
