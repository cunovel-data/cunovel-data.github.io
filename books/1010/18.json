{"id":38605,"no":18,"title":"Chapter VII","content":"A few evenings afterwards, cousin Clara happened to inquire of Grandfather, whether the old chair had never been present at a ball. At the same time, little Alice brought forward a doll, with whom she had been holding a long conversation. \"See, Grandfather,\" cried she. \"Did such a pretty lady as this ever sit in your great chair?\" These questions led Grandfather to talk about the fashions and manners, which now began to be introduced from England into the provinces. The simplicity of the good old Puritan times was fast disappearing. This was partly owing to the increasing number and wealth of the inhabitants, and to the additions which they continually received, by the arrival and settlement of people from beyond the sea. Another cause of a pompous and artificial mode of life, among those who could afford it, was, that the example was set by the royal governors. Under the old charter, the governors were the representatives of the people, and therefore their way of living had probably been marked by a popular simplicity. But now, as they represented the person of the king, they thought it necessary to preserve the dignity of [pg 118] their station, by the practice of high and gorgeous ceremonials. And, besides, the profitable offices under the government were filled by men who had lived in London, and had there contracted fashionable and luxurious habits of living, which they would not now lay aside. The wealthy people of the province imitated them; and thus began a general change in social life. \"So, my dear Clara,\" said Grandfather, \"after our chair had entered the Province House, it must often have been present at balls and festivals, though I cannot give you a description of any particular one. But I doubt not that they were very magnificent; and slaves in gorgeous liveries waited on the guests, and offered them wine in goblets of massive silver.\" \"Were there slaves in those days?\" exclaimed Clara. \"Yes; black slaves and white,\" replied Grandfather. \"Our ancestors not only bought negroes from Africa, but Indians from South America, and white people from Ireland. These last were sold, not for life, but for a certain number of years, in order to pay the expenses of their voyage across the Atlantic. Nothing was more common than to see a lot of likely Irish girls, advertised for sale in the newspapers. As for the little negro babies, they were offered to be given away, like young kittens.\" \"Perhaps Alice would have liked one to play with, instead of her doll,\" said Charley, laughing. [pg 119] But little Alice clasped the waxen doll closer to her bosom. \"Now, as for this pretty doll, my little Alice,\" said Grandfather, \"I wish you could have seen what splendid dresses the ladies wore in those times. They had silks, and satins, and damasks, and brocades, and high head-dresses, and all sorts of fine things. And they used to wear hooped-petticoats, of such enormous size that it was quite a journey to walk round them.\" \"And how did the gentlemen dress?\" asked Charley. \"With full as much magnificence as the ladies,\" answered Grandfather. \"For their holiday suits, they had coats of figured velvet, crimson, green, blue, and all other gay colors, embroidered with gold or silver lace. Their waistcoats, which were five times as large as modern ones, were very splendid. Sometimes, the whole waistcoat, which came down almost to the knees, was made of gold brocade.\" \"Why, the wearer must have shone like a golden image!\" said Clara. \"And, then,\" continued Grandfather, \"they wore various sorts of periwigs, such as the Tie, the Spencer, the Brigadier, the Major, the Albemarle, the Ramilies, the Feather-top, and the Full-bottom! Their three-cornered hats were laced with gold or silver. They had shining buckles at the knees of their small clothes, and buckles likewise in their [pg 120] shoes. They wore swords, with beautiful hilts, either of silver, or sometimes of polished steel, inlaid with gold.\" \"Oh, I should like to wear a sword!\" cried Charley. \"And an embroidered crimson velvet coat,\" said Clara, laughing, \"and a gold brocade waistcoat down to your knees!\" \"And knee-buckles and shoe-buckles,\" said Laurence, laughing also. \"And a periwig,\" added little Alice, soberly, not knowing what was the article of dress, which she recommended to our friend Charley. Grandfather smiled at the idea of Charley\u0027s sturdy little figure in such a grotesque caparison. He then went on with the history of the chair, and told the children, that, in 1730, King George the Second appointed Jonathan Belcher to be governor of Massachusetts, in place of the deceased Governor Burnet. Mr. Belcher was a native of the province, but had spent much of his life in Europe. The new governor found Grandfather\u0027s chair in the Province House, he was struck with its noble and stately aspect, but was of opinion, that age and hard services had made it scarcely so fit for courtly company, as when it stood in the Earl of Lincoln\u0027s hall. Wherefore, as Governor Belcher was fond of splendor, he employed a skilful artist to beautify the chair. This was done by polishing and varnishing it, and by gilding the carved work of the elbows, [pg 121] and likewise the oaken flowers of the back. The lion\u0027s head now shone like a veritable lump of gold. Finally, Governor Belcher gave the chair a cushion of blue damask, with a rich golden fringe. \"Our good old chair being thus glorified,\" proceeded Grandfather, \"it glittered with a great deal more splendor than it had exhibited just a century before, when the Lady Arbella brought it over from England. Most people mistook it for a chair of the latest London fashion. And this may serve for an example, that there is almost always an old and time-worn substance under all the glittering show of new invention.\" \"Grandfather, I cannot see any of the gilding,\" remarked Charley, who had been examining the chair very minutely. \"You will not wonder that it has been rubbed off,\" replied Grandfather, \"when you hear all the adventures that have since befallen the chair. Gilded it was; and the handsomest room in the Province House was adorned by it.\" There was not much to interest the children, in what happened during the years that Governor Belcher remained in the chair. At first, like Colonel Shute and Governor Burnet, he was engaged in disputing with the legislature about his salary. But, as he found it impossible to get a fixed sum, he finally obtained the king\u0027s leave to accept whatever the legislature chose to give him. And thus the people triumphed, after this long contest for the [pg 122] privilege of expending their own money as they saw fit. The remainder of Governor Belcher\u0027s term of office was principally taken up in endeavoring to settle the currency. Honest John Hull\u0027s pine-tree shillings had long ago been worn out, or lost, or melted down again, and their place was supplied by bills of paper or parchment, which were nominally valued at three pence and upwards. The value of these bills kept continually sinking, because the real hard money could not be obtained for them. They were a great deal worse than the old Indian currency of clam-shells. These disorders of the circulating medium were a source of endless plague and perplexity to the rulers and legislators, not only in Governor Belcher\u0027s days, but for many years before and afterwards. Finally, the people suspected that Governor Belcher was secretly endeavoring to establish the Episcopal mode of worship in the provinces. There was enough of the old Puritan spirit remaining, to cause most of the true sons of New England to look with horror upon such an attempt. Great exertions were made, to induce the king to remove the governor. Accordingly, in 1740, he was compelled to resign his office, and Grandfather\u0027s chair into the bargain, to Mr. Shirley. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3054/84462.html","bookId":1010,"book":{"id":1010,"title":"True Stories from History and Biography","description":"简介： In writing this ponderous tome, the author\u0027s desire has been to describe the eminent characters and remarkable events of our annals, in such a form and style, that the YOUNG might make acquaintance with them of their own accord.
