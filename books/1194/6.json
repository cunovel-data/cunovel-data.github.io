{"id":31725,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"The tram continued on its way and I was burning with curiosity to know what had happened to the unfortunate Countess. Had her husband killed her? I understood how that villain\u0027s mind worked. Desirous of enjoying his revenge, like all cruel souls, he wanted his wife to be present, without pause in playing, at the death of that unwary young man brought there by a spiteful trick on the part of Mudarra. But the lady could not continue making desperate efforts to keep calm, knowing that Rafael had swallowed the poison. A tragic and horrifying scene I thought, more convinced than ever of the reality of that event—and now you\u0027ll say that such things only happen in novels! \n \n On passing in front of Palacio the tram halted and a woman got on who was carrying a small dog in her arms. I immediately recognized the dog I had seen reclining at the feet of the Countess. This was the same dog with the same white and fine fur, the same black patch on one of his ears. As luck would have it the woman sat down next to me. Unable to resist being curious, I put the following question to her: \n \n \"Is this nice dog your dog?\" \n \n \"Who else could he belong to? Do you like him?\" \n \n I fondled one of the ears of the intelligent animal to show him affection, but he, oblivious to my blandishments, jumped and put his paws on the knees of the English woman, who showed me her two teeth again as if wanting to bite me, and exclaimed: \n \n \"Oh! You are unsupportable!\" \n \n \"And where did you acquire this dog?\" I asked without taking notice of the latest explosion of righteous indignation on the part of the British lady. \"Can you tell me?\" \n \n \"My mistress gave it me.\" \n \n \"And what became of your mistress?\" I asked most anxiously. \n \n \"Ah! Did you know her?\" the woman replied. \n \n \"She was a good woman, wasn\u0027t she?\" \n \n \"An excellent woman. But may I know how that bad business ended?\" \n \n \"So you know about it, you\u0027ve had news of it.\" \n \n \"Yes, madam. I know what happened, including the tea that was served. And tell me—did your mistress die?\" \n \n \"Yes, sir. She\u0027s gone to a better place.\" \n \n \"And what happened? Was she murdered or did she die of fright?\" \n \n \"What murder? What fright?\" she said with a mocking expression. \"You\u0027re not in the know after all. She ate something that disagreed with her that night and it harmed her. She had a fainting fit that lasted till dawn.\" \n \n This one, I thought, knows nothing about the incident with the piano and the poison or doesn\u0027t want to make me think she does. Afterwards I said in a loud voice: \n \n \"So she died of food poisoning?\" \n \n \"Yes, sir. I warned her not to eat those shellfish, but she took no notice of me.\" \n \n \"Shellfish, eh?\" I said incredulously. \"I know what really happened.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t you believe me?\" \n \n \"Yes. Yes,\" I replied, pretending to believe her. \"And what about the Count, her husband, the one who pulled the dagger on her while she was playing the piano?\" \n \n The woman looked at me for a moment and then laughed in my face. \n \n \"You\u0027re laughing, are you? Don\u0027t you think I know what took place? You don\u0027t want to tell me what really happened. There\u0027d be grounds for a criminal prosecution if you did.\" \n \n \"But you mentioned a count and a countess.\" \n \n \"Was not this dog\u0027s mistress the Countess wronged by the butler \n Mudarra?\" \n \n The woman burst out laughing again so uproariously that I muttered to myself distractedly: She must be Mudarra\u0027s accomplice and naturally she\u0027ll hide as much as she can. \n \n \"You\u0027re mad,\" the unknown woman added. \n \n \"Lunatic, lunatic. I\u0027m suffocated. Oh! My God!\" \n \n \"I know everything. Come now. Don\u0027t hide it from me. Tell me what the Countess died of.\" \n \n \"For crying out loud, what countess?\" exclaimed the woman, laughing even more loudly. \n \n \"Don\u0027t think you fool me with your laughter!\" I replied. \"The Countess was either poisoned or murdered. There\u0027s no doubt about it in my mind.\" \n \n At this juncture the tram arrived at Pozas and I had reached the end of my journey. We all got off. The English woman gave me a look indicative of her elation at finding herself free of me and each of us went in our several directions. I followed the woman with the dog, plying her with questions, until she reached her home still laughing at my determination to know better about other people\u0027s lives. Once alone in the street, I remembered the object of my journey and set off to visit the house where I was due to hand over those books. I gave them to the person who had asked for them in order to read them, and I started to walk up and down opposite Buen Suceso, waiting for the tram to reappear so I could then return to the opposite end of Madrid again. \n \n I waited a long time and finally, just as it was getting dark, the tram prepared to leave. \n \n I got on and the first thing I saw was the English lady sitting where she had sat before. When she saw me get on and sit down next to her, the expression on her face beggared description. She went as red as a beetroot and exclaimed: \n \n \"Oh! You again. I complain to driver—you are for high jump this time.\" \n \n I was so preoccupied with my own emotions that, without paying attention to what the English lady was saying in her laborious utterances, I answered her thus: \n \n \"Madam, there is no doubt that the Countess was either poisoned or killed. You have no idea of that man\u0027s ferocity.\" \n \n The tram continued on its way and every now and then stopped to take on passengers. Near the royal palace three got on, occupying seats opposite me. One of them was a tall, thin and bony man with very stern eyes and a bell-like voice that imposed respect. \n \n They hadn\u0027t been on ten minutes when this man turned to the others and said: \n \n \"Poor thing! How she cried out in her dying moments! The bullet went in above her right shoulder-blade and penetrated down to her heart.\" \n \n \"What?\" I exclaimed all of a sudden. \"She died of a shot and not a stab wound?\" \n \n The three of them looked at me in amazement. \n \n \"Of a shot, sir, yes,\" the tall, thin and bony one said with a certain amount of surliness. \n \n \"And that woman maintained she had died of food poisoning,\" I said, more interested in this affair by the minute. \"Tell me how it came about.\" \n \n \"And what concern is it of yours?\" said the other with an offhand gesture. \n \n \"I\u0027m very interested indeed to know the end of this horrific tragedy. \n Does it not seem to be straight from the pages of a novel?\" \n \n \"Where do novels and dead people come into it? Either you\u0027re mad or you\u0027re trying to make fun of us.\" \n \n \"Young man, be careful what you joke about,\" added the tall and thin one. \n \n \"Don\u0027t you think I know what happened? I know it all from start to finish. I witnessed all the various scenes of this horrendous crime. But you\u0027re saying that the Countess died of a pistol shot.\" \n \n \"Good God. We weren\u0027t talking about a Countess, but about my female dog that we inadvertently shot while out hunting. If you want to make a joke of it, meet me outside and I\u0027ll answer you as you deserve.\" \n \n \"I see where you\u0027re coming from. Now you\u0027re determined to keep the truth hidden,\" I said, thinking that these men wanted to lead me astray in my inquiries, transforming that unfortunate lady into a female dog. \n \n One of my interlocutors was doubtless preparing his answer, more physical than the case required, when the English woman put her finger to her temple as if to indicate to them that my head did not function properly. They calmed down at this and spoke not a single word more for the whole of their journey, which finished for them at the Puerta del Sol. No doubt they had been afraid of me. \n \n I was so fixated on the idea that a crime had been committed that it was in vain that I tried to calm down as I reasoned out the threads of such a complicated question. But each time I did so my confusion grew and the image of the poor lady refused to leave me. In all the countenances that succeeded one another inside the tram, I thought I might see something that would contribute to an explanation of the enigma. I felt a frightful overheating of my brain and no doubt this inner disturbance was reflected in my face as everyone looked at me as at something that you don\u0027t see every day. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1666/49096.html","bookId":1194,"book":{"id":1194,"title":"The Novel on the Tram","description":"简介： The tram left the end of the Salamanca district to pass through the whole of Madrid in the direction of Pozas.
