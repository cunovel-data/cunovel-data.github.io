{"id":31726,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"There was yet another incident which would turn my head during that fateful journey. On passing through the Calle de Alcalá a man got on with his wife. He sat down next to me. He was a man who seemed affected by some strong and recent emotion and I could even believe that, from time to time, he raised his handkerchief to his eyes to wipe away invisible tears which were no doubt being shed behind the dark green lenses of his unusual spectacles. After a short time he said in a low voice to the person I took to be his wife: \"They suspect that she was poisoned, there\u0027s no doubt about it. Don Mateo\u0027s just told me. Poor woman!\" \"How terrible! That\u0027s what I thought too,\" answered his wife. \"What else can you expect from such savages?\" \"I won\u0027t leave a stone unturned till I get to the bottom of this business.\" I, who was all ears, also said in a low voice: \"Yes, sir, she was poisoned. There\u0027s proof of it.\" \"What? You know? Did you know her too?\" said the man with the green specs, turning towards me. \"Yes, sir. And I do not doubt that her death was a violent one, no matter how hard they try to make us believe it was food poisoning.\" \"I\u0027m of the same opinion. What an excellent woman! But how do you know all this for a fact?\" \"I know, I know,\" I replied, extremely pleased that this man at least did not think I was mad. \"You\u0027ll make a declaration to the court then, for the judge has already started to sum up.\" \"I\u0027ll be happy just to see these rascals get what\u0027s coming to them. I\u0027ll make that declaration, yes, I will, sir.\" My moral blindness had reached such a point that I ended up completely taken in by this event half dreamed, half read about, and believed it as I now believe I\u0027m writing with a pen. \"Indeed I will, sir, for it is necessary to clear up this mystery so that the perpetrators of this crime can be punished. I will declare that she was poisoned by a cup of tea, the same as the young man.\" \"Did you hear that, Petronila?\" said the bespectacled man to his wife. \"By a cup of tea.\" \"Yes, it surprises me,\" the lady answered. \"What terrible things those monsters were capable of!\" \"It\u0027s true, sir. With a cup of tea. The Countess was playing the piano.\" \"What countess?\" the man asked, interrupting me. \"The countess. The woman who was poisoned.\" \"The woman in question was no countess.\" \"Come off it. You too are one of those determined to hide the facts in this case.\" \"This was no countess or duchess, but simply the woman who did my laundry for me, the wife of the pointsman at Madrid North station.\" \"A laundress, eh?\" I said roguishly. \"You won\u0027t make me swallow that one.\" The man and his wife looked at me quizzically and muttered some words to each other. From a gesture that I saw the woman make I understood that she had formed the deep conviction I was drunk. I opted not to argue and said nothing, content to despise such an irreverent supposition in silence as befits great souls. My anxiety knew no bounds. The Countess was not absent for a moment from my thoughts and she had started to interest me by reason of her sinister end as if all that had not been a morbid expression of my own impulse to fantasize, forged by successive visions and conversations. Finally, to understand to what extreme my madness carried me, I am going to relate the ultimate occurrence on this journey of mine. I shall say with what extravagance I put an end to the painful combat of my understanding caught in a battle with an army of shadows. The tram was entering the calle de Serrano when I chanced to look through the window opposite where I was sitting into the street, weakly lit by street lights, and I saw a man go by. I shouted with surprise and foolishly exclaimed the following: \"There he goes. It\u0027s him, Mudarra, the principal author of so many crimes.\" I ordered the tram to stop and alighted or rather jumped through the door, colliding with the feet and legs of the passengers. I descended to the street and ran after that man, shouting: \"Stop him! Stop him! Murderer!\" You can imagine what the effect of these words would have been in such a tranquil neighbourhood. The man in question, the same one I had seen in the tram that afternoon, was arrested. I, for my part, did not stop shouting: \"He\u0027s the one who prepared the poison for the Countess, the one who murdered the Countess.\" There was a moment of indescribable confusion. He affirmed that I was mad, but we were both placed in police custody. Afterwards I lost all notion of what was happening around me. I do not remember what I did that night in the place where they locked me up. The most vivid recollection that I have of such a strange event was to have awoken from the deep sleep I fell into, a veritable drunken stupor morally produced, I know not how, by one of the passing phenomena of alienation that science now studies with great care as one of the heralds of madness. As you can surmise the event did not have consequences because the unsympathetic person I baptized with the name of Mudarra was an honourable grocer who had never in his life poisoned any countess. But for a long time afterwards I persisted in my self-deception and was wont to exclaim: \"Poor countess. Whatever they say, I\u0027ll stick to my guns. No-one will persuade me that you did not end your days at the hand of your irate husband.\" Months needed to pass for the shadows to return to the unknown place from whence they had come forth driving me mad and for reality to gain the ascendance in my head. I always laugh when I remember that journey and all the consideration I had lavished beforehand on my dreamed-of victim I now devoted to—who do you think?—my travelling companion on that anguished expedition, the irascible English woman, whose foot I dislocated when I hastily left the tram to run after the alleged butler.
