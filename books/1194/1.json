{"id":31720,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"The tram left the end of the Salamanca district to pass through the whole of Madrid in the direction of Pozas. Motivated by a selfish desire to sit down before others with the same intention, I put my hand on the handrail of the stair leading to the upper deck, stepped onto the platform and went up. At the same time (a fateful meeting!) I collided with another passenger who was getting on the tram from the other side. I looked at him and recognized my friend Don Dionisio Cascajares y de la Vallina, a man as inoffensive as he was discreet, who had at this critical juncture the goodness to greet me with a warm and enthusiastic handshake. The shock of our unexpected meeting did not have serious consequences apart from the partial denting of a certain straw hat placed on top of the head of an English woman who was trying to get on behind my friend, and who suffered, no doubt for lack of agility, a glancing blow from his stick. We sat down without attaching exaggerated importance to this slight mishap and started to chat. \n \n Don Dionisio Cascajares is a famous doctor, although not for the depth of his knowledge of pathology, and a good man, since it could never be said of him that he was inclined to take what did not belong to him, nor to kill his fellow men by means other than those of his dangerous and scientific vocation. We can be quite sure that the leniency of his treatment and his complacency in not giving his patients any other treatment than the one they want are the root cause of the confidence he inspires in a great many families, irrespective of class, especially when, in his limitless kindness, he also has a reputation for meting out services over and above the call of duty though always of a rigorously honest nature. Nobody knows like he does interesting events which are not common knowledge, and no-one possesses to a higher degree the mania of asking questions, though this vice of being overly inquisitive is compensated for in him by the promptness with which he tells you everything he knows without others needing to take the trouble to sound him out. Judge then if such a fine exemplar of human flippancy would be in demand with the curious and the garrulous. This man, my friend as he is everyone\u0027s, was sitting next to me when the tram, slipping smoothly along its iron road, was going down the calle de Serrano, stopping from time to time in order to fill the few seats that still remained empty. We were so hemmed in that the bundle of books I was carrying with me became a source of great concern to me, and I was putting it first on one knee, then on the other. Finally I decided to sit on it, fearing to disturb the English lady, whose seat just happened to be next to me on my left. \n \n \"And where are you going?\" Cascajares asked me, looking at me over the top of his dark glasses, which made me feel that I was being watched by four eyes rather than two. I answered him evasively and he, not wanting to lose any time before finding something out, insisted on asking questions: \"And what\u0027s so-and-so up to? And that woman, what\u0027s-her-name, where is she?\" accompanied by other inquiries of the same ilk which were not fully replied to either. As a last resort, seeing how useless his attempts were to start a conversation, he set off on a path more in keeping with his expansive temperament and began to spill the beans: \n \n \"Poor countess!\" he said, expressing with a movement of his head and facial features his disinterested compassion. \"If she had followed my advice, she would not be in such a critical situation.\" \n \n \"Quite clearly,\" I replied mechanically, doing compassionate homage also to the aforementioned countess. \"Just imagine,\" he continued, \"that they\u0027ve let themselves be dominated by that man! And that man will end up being master of the house. Poor woman! She thinks that with tears and lamentations all can be remedied, but it isn\u0027t so. She must make a decision, for that man is a monster; I believe he has it in him to commit the most heinous crimes.\" \n \n \"Yes, he\u0027ll stop at nothing,\" I said, unconsciously participating in his indignation. \n \n \"He\u0027s like all those low-born men who follow their base instincts. If they raise their station in life, they become insufferable. His face is a clear indication that nothing good can come out of all this.\" \n \n \"It hits you in the face. I believe you.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll explain it to you in a nutshell. The countess is an excellent woman, angelic, as discreet as she is beautiful and deserving of something far better. But she is married to a man who does not understand the value of the treasure he possesses and he spends his life given over to gambling and to all sorts of illicit pastimes. She in the meantime gets bored and cries. Is it surprising that she tries to dull her pain honestly, here and there, wherever a piano is being played? Moreover I myself give her this advice and say it loud and clear: Madam, seek diversion. Life\u0027s too short. The count in the end will have to repent of his follies and your sufferings will then be over. It seems to me I\u0027m right.\" \n \n \"No doubt about it,\" I replied off the cuff, although, in my heart of hearts, as indifferent as I had been to begin with to the sundry misfortunes of the countess. \"But that\u0027s not the worst of it,\" Cascajares added, striking the floor with his stick, \"for now the count, in the prime of life, has started to be jealous, yes, of a certain young man who has taken to heart the enterprise of helping the countess to enjoy herself.\" \n \n \"The husband will be to blame if he succeeds.\" \n \n \"None of that would matter as the countess is virtue incarnate; none of that would matter, I say, if there was not a terrible man whom I suspect of being about to cause a disaster in that house.\" \n \n \"Really? And who is he, this man?\" I asked with a spark of curiosity. \n \n \"A former butler, well-liked by the count, who has set himself to make a martyr of the countess as unhappy as she is sensitive. It seems that he is now in possession of a certain secret which could compromise her, and with this weapon he presumes to do God knows what. It\u0027s infamous!\" \n \n \"It certainly is and he merits an exemplary punishment,\" I said, discharging in turn the weight of my wrath on that man. \n \n \"But she is innocent, she is an angel. But enough said! We\u0027ve reached Cibeles. Yes, on the right I can see Buenavista Park. Have them stop, boy. I\u0027m not one of those who jump off while the tram is still moving to split open their heads on the cobbles. Farewell, my friend, farewell.\" \n \n The tram stopped and Don Dionisio Cascajares y de la Vallina got off after shaking my hand again and inflicting more slight damage on the hat of the English lady who had not yet recovered from her original scare. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1666/49091.html","bookId":1194,"book":{"id":1194,"title":"The Novel on the Tram","description":"简介： The tram left the end of the Salamanca district to pass through the whole of Madrid in the direction of Pozas.
