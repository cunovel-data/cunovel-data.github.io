{"id":40972,"no":37,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVII.","content":"Ben Meets His Cousin. Ben supposed that his new guardian would be in favor of making an immediate call upon his uncle, but the Cuban counselled delay. \"First,\" he said, \"I wish to find, if I can, the broker through whom your uncle sold the securities of which he robbed your father. We can make out a case without it, but with this our case will be complete.\" \"Won\u0027t it be difficult to find out, Mr. Novarro?\" asked Ben. \"Difficult, but not impossible. To begin with, I know the date of probable transfer. Next, I know the securities. By visiting the offices of different brokers I may obtain some information. At any rate, I have mapped out my plan of procedure, and hope within a week to obtain a clew.\" [306] Ben asked no questions, feeling that he could safely leave the whole matter in the hands of so experienced a business man as his new guardian. They did not go to a hotel, but to a boarding-house kept by a Cuban lady, a friend of his guardian, which they found quite as comfortable and more homelike than the Metropolitan or the Windsor. Meanwhile Ben thought it best not to make a call at the office of his uncle. Indeed, remembering the cruel way in which he had wronged his mother, he would have found it disagreeable to meet him. But one day, on Broadway, he met his cousin, Clarence Plantagenet. He would have avoided the encounter, but it was too late, for Clarence had seen him. \"What! Ben!\" he exclaimed. \"I had no idea you were back in New York. When did you arrive?\" \"Three days since,\" answered Ben. \"Where are you staying?\" \"At a boarding-house in Forty-second street.\" [307] \"How is Major Grafton?\" \"I don\u0027t know; I am no longer with him.\" \"What!\" exclaimed Clarence, pricking up his ears. \"You are no longer in his employ?\" \"No.\" \"Where is he?\" \"I left him in Europe.\" \"What did he discharge you for?\" asked Clarence, cheerfully. \"He didn\u0027t discharge me. He was opposed to my leaving him, but we couldn\u0027t agree.\" \"I think you are a fool!\" said Clarence, bluntly. \"With him you could live like a gentleman. You haven\u0027t got another place, have you?\" \"No.\" \"And you won\u0027t get one very soon, I can tell you that, except as a boy at three or four dollars a week.\" Ben smiled. \"I can look round, at any rate,\" he answered. \"That\u0027s all the good it\u0027ll do. You mustn\u0027t expect my father to help you.\" [308] \"I don\u0027t. If I had, I should have called before this.\" \"After throwing up a good place, if you were not discharged, you don\u0027t deserve help.\" \"I am not sure that I shall look for another place,\" said Ben. \"You are not?\" asked Clarence, mystified. \"No; I may go to school a little longer. I haven\u0027t as good an education as I should like.\" \"But how are you going to live while you are doing all this?\" \"Don\u0027t you think your father would give me a home in his family and let me attend school in the city?\" \"Well, Ben Baker, you have got cheek, I declare! If that is what you are counting on, you may as well give it up.\" \"It\u0027s as well to know the worst,\" said Ben, tranquilly. \"I shall have to be going along,\" said Clarence, coldly. He told his father at dinner about his meeting with Ben. \"I\u0027ll tell you what, father,\" he said. \"I couldn\u0027t account at first for Ben\u0027s seeming so [309] cool and independent. I think I understand it now.\" \"Well, suppose you explain, then.\" \"I think he\u0027s robbed Major Grafton of a sum of money and taken French leave. He said he was not \u0027bounced\u0027 and that the major did not want him to leave.\" \"I hope you are wrong, my son. I haven\u0027t the highest opinion of your cousin, but I earnestly hope he is honest. To have him guilty of such a crime would be a disgrace to our family. Always be honest, Clarence! Depend upon it, honesty is the best policy, and a boy or man makes a great mistake who appropriates what is not his own.\" \"Of course, pa, I know all that. Do you think I would steal? As to Ben Baker, that\u0027s a different matter. He\u0027s always been poor, and I suppose the temptation was too strong for him.\" \"Let us hope not. Dishonesty I could not overlook, even in a relation.\" Who would imagine that this man, so strict in his ideas of honesty, had deliberately stolen a hundred thousand dollars from his widowed sister and her son! \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2945/80935.html","bookId":467,"book":{"id":467,"title":"A Boy\u0027s Fortune","description":"简介： Wake up there!
