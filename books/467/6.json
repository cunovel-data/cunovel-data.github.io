{"id":40941,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI.","content":"Ben Gets Into Trouble. Ben went out of his uncle\u0027s store in a serious frame of mind. He knew that his uncle was opposed to his leaving his country home and coming to New York, but he had hoped that he would nevertheless be willing to extend to him a helping hand, especially as it would cost him so little. He found himself now in a critical position. He had in his pocket a dollar and twenty-seven cents, and this constituted his entire worldly capital. It was enough to carry him back to Sunderland, but, if he had been willing to do that, it would have been for his interest to accept his uncle\u0027s offer to refund to him what his trip would cost. But Ben was not easily discouraged. His motto was: \"If at first you don\u0027t succeed, Try, try again!\" [46] \"I won\u0027t go back to Sunderland unless I am obliged to,\" he said to himself. \"There are other stores besides my uncle\u0027s in this large city, and more ways of making a living than one. I won\u0027t give up till I have tried my best.\" So he walked along Broadway in a leisurely way, keeping his eyes wide open, and interested, in spite of his critical circumstances, in the crowds and bustle of that brilliant thoroughfare. Presently he came to a shop window on which was posted the notice— \"Boy Wanted.\" \"Here\u0027s a chance for me,\" he thought, hopefully. \"I\u0027ll apply for the place. I can\u0027t be any more than refused.\" He entered. It was a store appropriated to \"Gentlemen\u0027s Furnishing Goods.\" A tall young man, with his auburn hair parted in the middle, glanced at him languidly. \"I see you want a boy,\" said Ben, plunging at once into business. \"Humph! Are you the boy?\" [47] \"I am a boy, and would like a place,\" answered Ben. The clerk picked his teeth languidly with a wooden toothpick which he had brought from the cheap restaurant where he had taken his breakfast. \"Are you from the country?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"How long have you been in the city?\" \"I arrived yesterday.\" \"Then you don\u0027t know your way round New York?\" \"No; but I would soon learn.\" \"That wouldn\u0027t suit us. Besides, you don\u0027t live with your parents.\" \"My father is dead; my mother lives in the country.\" \"You won\u0027t suit us, then. However, you can go back and speak to Mr. Talbot. There he is, in the rear of the store.\" Ben had at first supposed that the young man with whom he was speaking was the proprietor. He did not dream that he was a clerk, working for nine dollars a week. He made application to Mr. Talbot, a middle-aged [48] gentleman, not half so consequential as his clerk, but was asked essentially the same questions as before. \"I am afraid I must refuse you,\" said Mr. Talbot, kindly. \"We require a boy who is used to the city streets, and we prefer that he should live with his parents. I am sorry for your disappointment.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said Ben; but it was in rather a subdued tone. His prospects did not seem quite so good as a little while before. Coming out into the street, Ben saw quite a crowd of boys and young men, who were following a tall lady, just in advance, and showing signs of amusement. It only took a glance to discover the cause of their mirth. The lady wore a sack, evidently just purchased, on which was a card, bearing in large, distinct characters, the words: \"Cheap for Cash.\" This it was that had excited the amusement of the crowd. Ben was also amused, but he sympathized [49] with the lady; and, stepping forward promptly, touched her on the arm. She looked back in surprise, and then for the first time became aware of the crowd that was following her. She was a lady probably nearing forty, and had a shrewd, kindly look. \"What does it all mean?\" she asked. \"There is something on your sack, madam. Allow me to remove it.\" And Ben plucked off the ticket, which he handed to the lady. \"I am not surprised at the amusement of the boys,\" said the lady, smiling. \"The ticket should have been removed. I am very much obliged to you, my young friend.\" \"You are quite welcome,\" said Ben, bowing and falling back. The lady smiled, and passed on. She would have remained had she known that by his act of kindness her young acquaintance had involved himself in trouble. No sooner had the lady disappeared than the disappointed young ruffians who had been making sport of her turned angrily upon our hero. [50] \"Ain\u0027t you smart?\" sneered one. \"You\u0027re a little too fresh, country!\" said another. Ben turned from one to another in surprise. He didn\u0027t understand in what way he had offended. \"What is the matter?\" he asked. \"What have I done?\" \"What made you tell the lady what she had on her back?\" demanded a third. \"I thought she ought to know,\" answered Ben. \"Oh, you did!\" sneered the first. \"What you wanted was a reward. I\u0027m glad she didn\u0027t give you a cent.\" \"You judge me by yourself,\" said Ben, provoked. \"I can be polite without being paid for it.\" \"Say that again!\" said Mike Rafferty, a freckle-faced young rowdy, squaring off in a scientific manner. \"All right; I do say it again!\" returned Ben, angrily. \"Take that, then!\" said the fellow, as he struck at Ben. [51] Our hero dodged, and returned the compliment. At that moment a policeman came round the corner, just in time to see Ben\u0027s demonstration. \"So you\u0027re fightin\u0027 agin, you young rascal!\" exclaimed the valiant officer. \"I\u0027ve got ye this time!\" and he seized Ben by the shoulder. Ben turned, and, it must be confessed, was startled to find himself, for the first time in his life, in the hands of the law. \"That boy attacked me, sir,\" he said. \"It\u0027s a lie!\" exclaimed Mike Rafferty. \"Isn\u0027t it b\u0027yes?\" \"Yes, it\u0027s a lie!\" chimed in his companions, whose sympathies, of course, were with Mike. \"Jist what I thought meself,\" said the astute officer. \"Say, cop, ye didn\u0027t see me hit him?\" said Mike. \"Don\u0027t ye call me cop!\" said the policeman, with insulted dignity. \"I mean captain,\" amended Mike, craftily. [52] \"What\u0027s all the fuss about?\" interrogated the officer. \"I axed him was he from the country, and he got mad and hit me,\" said Mike. \"Say, b\u0027yes, ain\u0027t it so?\" \"Yes, that\u0027s so,\" answered the boys, in chorus. \"Then you must come with me, you young rascal!\" said the officer. \"Where?\" asked Ben, with sinking heart. \"To the station-house. I\u0027ll tache ye to fight in the streets. You must go along, too, and make complaint,\" he added, addressing Mike Rafferty. \"All right, captain. Come along, b\u0027yes,\" said Mike, with a wink of enjoyment at his companions. Ben felt not a little humiliated at walking along Broadway in the clutch of a policeman. He felt bewildered, too, it had come upon him so quickly. It really seemed as if misfortunes were crowding upon him. First, his uncle had practically disowned him, he had been rebuffed in his attempt to obtain employment, and now he was arrested, and on his way to [53] the station-house, charged with fighting and disorderly conduct in the streets. To make matters worse and heighten his humiliation, as he was walking along, shrinking from observation, he met his cousin, Clarence Plantagenet, in company with another boy, somewhat older, dressed also in the height of the fashion. Clarence regarded Ben in amazement, and turned away his head in a disgust which he did not attempt to conceal. \"He will tell Uncle Nicholas,\" thought our unfortunate hero, \"and he will think I have been doing something disgraceful.\" \"Come along, ye young rapscallion!\" said the policeman, roughly, \"I\u0027ll soon attind to your case.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2945/80904.html","bookId":467,"book":{"id":467,"title":"A Boy\u0027s Fortune","description":"简介： Wake up there!
