{"id":40968,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII.","content":"An Astounding Discovery. Ben told his story so far as it concerned his engagement by Major Grafton and his visit to Europe. Of his mother and her circumstances and of his uncle he had scarcely occasion to speak, considering that his auditor would hardly feel interested in his own personal history. The Cuban, who had a grave, kindly aspect, listened with close attention to his narrative. When Ben ceased speaking he said: \"My young friend, there is one thing that puzzles me in this story of yours.\" \"What is it, sir?\" asked Ben, anxiously. He feared that the stranger did not believe him. \"Why should you need to travel with Major Grafton, or any other gentleman, as private secretary, unless, indeed, your mother did not wish you to come to Europe alone?\" [272] Ben stared at his interlocutor in amazement. \"How could I come to Europe alone?\" he asked. \"Where should I find the money to pay my expenses?\" \"Your mother might pay the expenses of your trip.\" \"My mother is very poor, Mr. Novarro.\" \"Very poor! Has she, then, lost the money that your father left her?\" \"I think you must be under a great mistake, Mr. Novarro. My uncle allows my mother a small income, and I help her all I can.\" \"There is certainly a great mistake somewhere,\" said the Cuban. \"To my certain knowledge your father possessed a hundred thousand dollars in first-class securities. Didn\u0027t you know anything of this?\" continued Mr. Novarro, observing Ben\u0027s look of extreme amazement. \"I know nothing of it, Mr. Novarro.\" \"Then he must have been robbed of the securities which I myself gave him on the 18th day of May, in the year 18—\" [273] \"That was the day of my father\u0027s death,\" said Ben. \"He died on that very day?\" said the Cuban in excitement. \"Tell me the particulars of your father\u0027s death. Did he die a natural death?\" \"Yes, sir; he died of heart disease.\" \"And where?\" \"In the house of my Uncle Nicholas.\" \"Before he had time to go home? Before he had acquainted your mother with his good fortune?\" \"Neither my mother nor myself knew but that he died a poor man.\" \"But he had the securities with him. Did your uncle say nothing of them?\" \"Not a word.\" A look of suspicion appeared on the face of Filippo Novarro. \"Tell me,\" he said, quickly—\"did your uncle, shortly after your father\u0027s death, enlarge his business?\" \"Yes, sir; he moved from a small store in Grand street to a larger store on Broadway—the one which he now occupies.\" [274] With the Cuban, suspicion was now changed to certainty. He brought down his fist heavily upon the table at his side. \"I know all now,\" he said. \"Your uncle deliberately robbed your dead father of the securities which I had placed in his hands, and coolly appropriating them to his own use, used the proceeds to build up and extend his business, leaving your mother to live in poverty.\" \"I feel bewildered,\" said Ben. \"I can hardly believe my uncle would treat us so shamefully.\" \"By the way, when did your mother move to Minnesota?\" asked the Cuban. \"To Minnesota?\" \"Yes. When I was in New York, not long since, I called upon your uncle and signified my intention to call upon your mother. He told me she had moved to Minnesota, and, of course, I was compelled to give up my plan.\" \"My mother has never moved to Minnesota; she still lives in Sunderland.\" [275] \"Then your uncle intended to prevent our meeting. He feared, doubtless, that if we met, his rascality would be discovered. Providence has defeated his cunningly-devised scheme, and the truth will soon be brought to light, to his confusion.\" \"I am afraid, sir, it will be difficult for my mother and myself to prove that my father left money. We have no money, with which to hire legal assistance.\" \"I propose to take the matter into my own hands. I am personally interested as the agent whom my dead friend commissioned to pay a debt of gratitude to the man who saved his life. Have you anything to detain you in Europe?\" \"No, sir, except an empty purse.\" \"Permit me to act as your banker.\" Mr. Novarro drew from his pocket two hundred and fifty francs in gold and paper and handed them to Ben. To our hero it seemed like a fairy-tale, in which he was playing the leading part. He half-feared that the gold would turn into brass and the bank-notes into withered leaves; but, [276] strange though it was, he saw good reason to think that his good fortune was real. \"How can I thank you, sir, for your liberality?\" he said, gratefully. \"You forget that this is your own money; I am only advancing it to you, and shall be repaid speedily. Will you accept me as your guardian to protect your interests and compel your uncle to disgorge his ill-gotten gains?\" \"Thankfully, sir, if you are willing to take the trouble.\" \"Then you will sail with me for New York by the next steamer. Have you your luggage with you?\" \"I have nothing, sir, except what I have on my back. I had to leave the asylum without a change, and I have not been able to change my clothes for a week or more.\" \"I had forgotten. This must be looked to at once. We will take lunch, and then go out and purchase a new supply of under-clothing.\" Once more Ben had fallen on his feet. At what appeared to be the darkest moment light [277] had suddenly fallen across his path, and he had stumbled upon the one man who was able to bring him into the sunshine. Before night his wardrobe had been quite replenished, and he breathed a deep sigh of relief as he found himself in fresh and clean attire. He sought out the tramp who had escorted him to the hotel, and liberally rewarded him. \"I shall telegraph for passage in the Havre line of steamships,\" said Mr. Novarro. \"A steamer is to sail on Saturday, so that we shall not have long to wait.\" \"I fear, Mr. Novarro, you are interrupting your own plans in order to befriend me,\" said Ben to his new patron. \"I have no plans. I am—perhaps unfortunately for myself—a rich man, under no necessity of labor. Indeed, my chief aim has been to pass my time as pleasantly as possible. Now I find something to do, and I find myself happier for having some object in life. I am rejoiced that we have met. It has brought to my life a new interest; and even after I have redeemed your wrongs I shall hope to [278] keep up my acquaintance with you, and to make the acquaintance of your mother.\" \"You may be sure, sir, that my mother will be only too glad to know so true a friend.\" The Cuban regarded Ben with a look of interest and affection. He was beginning to be attracted to him for his own sake. He was a man of energetic temperament, though a large inheritance had hitherto prevented any display of energy. At length the occasion had arisen, and he looked forward with eagerness to the struggle with the New York merchant to secure the rights of his new friend. On the next day Ben and his guardian left Lyons for Paris. They had two days in this lovely city, and late on Friday evening they reached Havre, the point where they were to embark for America. \"The first act is over, Ben,\" said the Cuban. \"Our ocean trip is a long wait between the first and second acts. When the curtain next rises it will be in New York, and there will be other actors to take an unwilling part in our drama, which is devoted to the detection and punishment of guilt.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2945/80931.html","bookId":467,"book":{"id":467,"title":"A Boy\u0027s Fortune","description":"简介： Wake up there!
