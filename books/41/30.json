{"id":1073,"no":30,"title":"chapter 30","content":"Philip was restless and dissatisfied. Hayward’s poetic allusions troubled his imagination, and his soul yearned for romance. At least that was how he put it to himself. \n \n And it happened that an incident was taking place in Frau Erlin’s house which increased Philip’s preoccupation with the matter of sex. Two or three times on his walks among the hills he had met Fraulein Cacilie wandering by herself. He had passed her with a bow, and a few yards further on had seen the Chinaman. He thought nothing of it; but one evening on his way home, when night had already fallen, he passed two people walking very close together. Hearing his footstep, they separated quickly, and though he could not see well in the darkness he was almost certain they were Cacilie and Herr Sung. Their rapid movement apart suggested that they had been walking arm in arm. Philip was puzzled and surprised. He had never paid much attention to Fraulein Cacilie. She was a plain girl, with a square face and blunt features. She could not have been more than sixteen, since she still wore her long fair hair in a plait. That evening at supper he looked at her curiously; and, though of late she had talked little at meals, she addressed him. \n \n ‘Where did you go for your walk today, Herr Carey?’ she asked. \n \n ‘Oh, I walked up towards the Konigstuhl.’ \n \n ‘I didn’t go out,’ she volunteered. ‘I had a headache.’ \n \n The Chinaman, who sat next to her, turned round. \n \n ‘I’m so sorry,’ he said. ‘I hope it’s better now.’ \n \n Fraulein Cacilie was evidently uneasy, for she spoke again to Philip. \n \n ‘Did you meet many people on the way?’ \n \n Philip could not help reddening when he told a downright lie. \n \n ‘No. I don’t think I saw a living soul.’ \n \n He fancied that a look of relief passed across her eyes. \n \n Soon, however, there could be no doubt that there was something between the pair, and other people in the Frau Professor’s house saw them lurking in dark places. The elderly ladies who sat at the head of the table began to discuss what was now a scandal. The Frau Professor was angry and harassed. She had done her best to see nothing. The winter was at hand, and it was not as easy a matter then as in the summer to keep her house full. Herr Sung was a good customer: he had two rooms on the ground floor, and he drank a bottle of Moselle at each meal. The Frau Professor charged him three marks a bottle and made a good profit. None of her other guests drank wine, and some of them did not even drink beer. Neither did she wish to lose Fraulein Cacilie, whose parents were in business in South America and paid well for the Frau Professor’s motherly care; and she knew that if she wrote to the girl’s uncle, who lived in Berlin, he would immediately take her away. The Frau Professor contented herself with giving them both severe looks at table and, though she dared not be rude to the Chinaman, got a certain satisfaction out of incivility to Cacilie. But the three elderly ladies were not content. Two were widows, and one, a Dutchwoman, was a spinster of masculine appearance; they paid the smallest possible sum for their pension, and gave a good deal of trouble, but they were permanent and therefore had to be put up with. They went to the Frau Professor and said that something must be done; it was disgraceful, and the house was ceasing to be respectable. The Frau Professor tried obstinacy, anger, tears, but the three old ladies routed her, and with a sudden assumption of virtuous indignation she said that she would put a stop to the whole thing. \n \n After luncheon she took Cacilie into her bed-room and began to talk very seriously to her; but to her amazement the girl adopted a brazen attitude; she proposed to go about as she liked; and if she chose to walk with the Chinaman she could not see it was anybody’s business but her own. The Frau Professor threatened to write to her uncle. \n \n ‘Then Onkel Heinrich will put me in a family in Berlin for the winter, and that will be much nicer for me. And Herr Sung will come to Berlin too.’ \n \n The Frau Professor began to cry. The tears rolled down her coarse, red, fat cheeks; and Cacilie laughed at her. \n \n ‘That will mean three rooms empty all through the winter,’ she said. \n \n Then the Frau Professor tried another plan. She appealed to Fraulein Cacilie’s better nature: she was kind, sensible, tolerant; she treated her no longer as a child, but as a grown woman. She said that it wouldn’t be so dreadful, but a Chinaman, with his yellow skin and flat nose, and his little pig’s eyes! That’s what made it so horrible. It filled one with disgust to think of it. \n \n ‘Bitte, bitte,’ said Cacilie, with a rapid intake of the breath. ‘I won’t listen to anything against him.’ \n \n ‘But it’s not serious?’ gasped Frau Erlin. \n \n ‘I love him. I love him. I love him.’ \n \n ‘Gott im Himmel!’ \n \n The Frau Professor stared at her with horrified surprise; she had thought it was no more than naughtiness on the child’s part, and innocent, folly. but the passion in her voice revealed everything. Cacilie looked at her for a moment with flaming eyes, and then with a shrug of her shoulders went out of the room. \n \n Frau Erlin kept the details of the interview to herself, and a day or two later altered the arrangement of the table. She asked Herr Sung if he would not come and sit at her end, and he with his unfailing politeness accepted with alacrity. Cacilie took the change indifferently. But as if the discovery that the relations between them were known to the whole household made them more shameless, they made no secret now of their walks together, and every afternoon quite openly set out to wander about the hills. It was plain that they did not care what was said of them. At last even the placidity of Professor Erlin was moved, and he insisted that his wife should speak to the Chinaman. She took him aside in his turn and expostulated; he was ruining the girl’s reputation, he was doing harm to the house, he must see how wrong and wicked his conduct was; but she was met with smiling denials; Herr Sung did not know what she was talking about, he was not paying any attention to Fraulein Cacilie, he never walked with her; it was all untrue, every word of it. \n \n ‘Ach, Herr Sung, how can you say such things? You’ve been seen again and again.’ \n \n ‘No, you’re mistaken. It’s untrue.’ \n \n He looked at her with an unceasing smile, which showed his even, little white teeth. He was quite calm. He denied everything. He denied with bland effrontery. At last the Frau Professor lost her temper and said the girl had confessed she loved him. He was not moved. He continued to smile. \n \n ‘Nonsense! Nonsense! It’s all untrue.’ \n \n She could get nothing out of him. The weather grew very bad; there was snow and frost, and then a thaw with a long succession of cheerless days, on which walking was a poor amusement. One evening when Philip had just finished his German lesson with the Herr Professor and was standing for a moment in the drawing-room, talking to Frau Erlin, Anna came quickly in. \n \n ‘Mamma, where is Cacilie?’ she said. \n \n ‘I suppose she’s in her room.’ \n \n ‘There’s no light in it.’ \n \n The Frau Professor gave an exclamation, and she looked at her daughter in dismay. The thought which was in Anna’s head had flashed across hers. \n \n ‘Ring for Emil,’ she said hoarsely. \n \n This was the stupid lout who waited at table and did most of the housework. He came in. \n \n ‘Emil, go down to Herr Sung’s room and enter without knocking. If anyone is there say you came in to see about the stove.’ \n \n No sign of astonishment appeared on Emil’s phlegmatic face. \n \n He went slowly downstairs. The Frau Professor and Anna left the door open and listened. Presently they heard Emil come up again, and they called him. \n \n ‘Was anyone there?’ asked the Frau Professor. \n \n ‘Yes, Herr Sung was there.’ \n \n ‘Was he alone?’ \n \n The beginning of a cunning smile narrowed his mouth. \n \n ‘No, Fraulein Cacilie was there.’ \n \n ‘Oh, it’s disgraceful,’ cried the Frau Professor. \n \n Now he smiled broadly. \n \n ‘Fraulein Cacilie is there every evening. She spends hours at a time there.’ \n \n Frau Professor began to wring her hands. \n \n ‘Oh, how abominable! But why didn’t you tell me?’ \n \n ‘It was no business of mine,’ he answered, slowly shrugging his shoulders. \n \n ‘I suppose they paid you well. Go away. Go.’ \n \n He lurched clumsily to the door. \n \n ‘They must go away, mamma,’ said Anna. \n \n ‘And who is going to pay the rent? And the taxes are falling due. It’s all very well for you to say they must go away. If they go away I can’t pay the bills.’ She turned to Philip, with tears streaming down her face. ‘Ach, Herr Carey, you will not say what you have heard. If Fraulein Forster—’ this was the Dutch spinster—‘if Fraulein Forster knew she would leave at once. And if they all go we must close the house. I cannot afford to keep it.’ \n \n ‘Of course I won’t say anything.’ \n \n ‘If she stays, I will not speak to her,’ said Anna. \n \n That evening at supper Fraulein Cacilie, redder than usual, with a look of obstinacy on her face, took her place punctually; but Herr Sung did not appear, and for a while Philip thought he was going to shirk the ordeal. At last he came, very smiling, his little eyes dancing with the apologies he made for his late arrival. He insisted as usual on pouring out the Frau Professor a glass of his Moselle, and he offered a glass to Fraulein Forster. The room was very hot, for the stove had been alight all day and the windows were seldom opened. Emil blundered about, but succeeded somehow in serving everyone quickly and with order. The three old ladies sat in silence, visibly disapproving: the Frau Professor had scarcely recovered from her tears; her husband was silent and oppressed. Conversation languished. It seemed to Philip that there was something dreadful in that gathering which he had sat with so often; they looked different under the light of the two hanging lamps from what they had ever looked before; he was vaguely uneasy. Once he caught Cacilie’s eye, and he thought she looked at him with hatred and contempt. The room was stifling. It was as though the beastly passion of that pair troubled them all; there was a feeling of Oriental depravity; a faint savour of joss-sticks, a mystery of hidden vices, seemed to make their breath heavy. Philip could feel the beating of the arteries in his forehead. He could not understand what strange emotion distracted him; he seemed to feel something infinitely attractive, and yet he was repelled and horrified. \n \n For several days things went on. The air was sickly with the unnatural passion which all felt about them, and the nerves of the little household seemed to grow exasperated. Only Herr Sung remained unaffected; he was no less smiling, affable, and polite than he had been before: one could not tell whether his manner was a triumph of civilisation or an expression of contempt on the part of the Oriental for the vanquished West. Cacilie was flaunting and cynical. At last even the Frau Professor could bear the position no longer. Suddenly panic seized her; for Professor Erlin with brutal frankness had suggested the possible consequences of an intrigue which was now manifest to everyone, and she saw her good name in Heidelberg and the repute of her house ruined by a scandal which could not possibly be hidden. For some reason, blinded perhaps by her interests, this possibility had never occurred to her; and now, her wits muddled by a terrible fear, she could hardly be prevented from turning the girl out of the house at once. It was due to Anna’s good sense that a cautious letter was written to the uncle in Berlin suggesting that Cacilie should be taken away. \n \n But having made up her mind to lose the two lodgers, the Frau Professor could not resist the satisfaction of giving rein to the ill-temper she had curbed so long. She was free now to say anything she liked to Cacilie. \n \n ‘I have written to your uncle, Cacilie, to take you away. I cannot have you in my house any longer.’ \n \n Her little round eyes sparkled when she noticed the sudden whiteness of the girl’s face. \n \n ‘You’re shameless. Shameless,’ she went on. \n \n She called her foul names. \n \n ‘What did you say to my uncle Heinrich, Frau Professor?’ the girl asked, suddenly falling from her attitude of flaunting independence. \n \n ‘Oh, he’ll tell you himself. I expect to get a letter from him tomorrow.’ \n \n Next day, in order to make the humiliation more public, at supper she called down the table to Cacilie. \n \n ‘I have had a letter from your uncle, Cacilie. You are to pack your things tonight, and we will put you in the train tomorrow morning. He will meet you himself in Berlin at the Central Bahnhof.’ \n \n ‘Very good, Frau Professor.’ \n \n Herr Sung smiled in the Frau Professor’s eyes, and notwithstanding her protests insisted on pouring out a glass of wine for her. The Frau Professor ate her supper with a good appetite. But she had triumphed unwisely. Just before going to bed she called the servant. \n \n ‘Emil, if Fraulein Cacilie’s box is ready you had better take it downstairs tonight. The porter will fetch it before breakfast.’ \n \n The servant went away and in a moment came back. \n \n ‘Fraulein Cacilie is not in her room, and her bag has gone.’ \n \n With a cry the Frau Professor hurried along: the box was on the floor, strapped and locked; but there was no bag, and neither hat nor cloak. The dressing-table was empty. Breathing heavily, the Frau Professor ran downstairs to the Chinaman’s rooms, she had not moved so quickly for twenty years, and Emil called out after her to beware she did not fall; she did not trouble to knock, but burst in. The rooms were empty. The luggage had gone, and the door into the garden, still open, showed how it had been got away. In an envelope on the table were notes for the money due on the month’s board and an approximate sum for extras. Groaning, suddenly overcome by her haste, the Frau Professor sank obesely on to a sofa. There could be no doubt. The pair had gone off together. Emil remained stolid and unmoved. \n \n \n \n 第三十章 \n \n 菲利普坐卧不安，身心得不到满足。海沃德富有诗意的旁征博引，使他想入非非，他的心灵渴望着浪漫艳遇，至少，他对自己就是这么说的。 \n \n 正好这时候欧林太太的公寓里发生了一桩事儿，使菲利普越发专注于有关两性的问题。有两三回菲利普在山间散步，遇到凯西莉小姐一个人在那里溜达。菲利普走过她身边，朝她一躬身，继续往前；没走多远，又看到了那个中国人。当时也不觉得有什么；可是有一天傍晚，夜幕已经低垂，他在回家的路上打两个行人身旁经过。那两人原是紧靠在一起的，可他们一听到菲利普的脚步声，赶紧向两旁闪开。夜色朦胧，菲利普看不真切，但几乎可以肯定那是凯西莉和宋先生。他俩如此忙不迭分开，说明他们刚才是手勾着手走的。菲利普惊讶之余又有点困惑。他对凯西莉从未多加注意。这个姑娘平常得很，方方的脸，五官并不怎么清秀。既然她把一头金发编成长辫子，说明她还没超过十六岁。那天晚上用餐时，菲利普好奇地打量她，尽管她近来在桌上很少言语，这会儿倒主动跟菲利普攀谈起来了。 \n \n \"您今天去哪儿散步来着，凯里先生？\"她问。 \n \n \"哦，我朝御座山那儿走了一程。\" \n \n \"我呆在屋里没出去，\"她主动表白说，\"头有点疼。\" \n \n 坐在她身边的那个中国人，这时转脸对她说： \n \n \"真遗憾\"他说：\"希望您这会儿好点了吧。 \n \n 凯西莉小姐显然放心不下，因为她又问了菲利普这么一句： \n \n \"路上您遇到不少人吧？\" \n \n 菲利普当面扯了个弥大大谎，脸儿禁不住红了起来。 \n \n \"没啊，我想连个人影儿也没见着。\" \n \n 菲利普觉得她的眼睛里闪过宽慰的神情。 \n \n 然而不久，关于他俩关系暧昧这一点，不可能再有什么好怀疑的了。教授太太公寓里的其他人，也看到过他俩躲在幽暗处不知鬼鬼祟祟干啥。坐在上席的那几位老太太，现在开始把这件事当作丑闻来谈论。教授太太义气又恼，但她尽力装作什么也没察觉。此时已近隆冬，不比夏天了，要让公寓住满房客可不那么容易。宋先生是位不。不可多得的好主顾：他在底楼租了两个房间，每餐都要喝一瓶摩泽尔葡萄酒，教授太太每瓶收他二个马克，赚头挺不错。可是，她的其他房客都不喝酒，有的甚至连啤酒也点滴不沾。她也不想失掉凯西莉小姐这样的房客。她的父母在南美洲经商，为了酬谢教授太太慈母般的悉心照顾，他们付的费用相当可观。教授太太心里明白，假如她写信给那位住在柏林的凯西莉小姐的伯父，他会马上把她带走的。于是，教授太太满足于在餐桌上朝他俩狠狠地瞪上几眼；她不敢得罪那位中国人，不过尽可以对凯西莉小姐恶声恶气，以发泄自己的心头之恨。但是那三位老太太却不肯就此罢休。她们三个，两个是寡妇，一个是长相颇似男子的荷兰老处女。她们付的膳宿费已经少得不能再少，而且还经常给人添麻烦，但她们毕竟是永久性的房客，所以对她们也只得将就些。她们跑到教授太太跟前说，一定得果断处置才是，这太不成体统，整个公寓的名声都要给败坏了。教授太太施出浑身解数招架，时而正面顶牛，时而勃然大怒，时而痛哭流涕，但还是敌不过那三位老太太。最后，她突然摆出一副疾恶如仇的架势，愤然表示要了结这桩公案。 \n \n 吃完午饭，教授太太把凯西莉带到自己的卧房里，开始正言厉色地同她谈话。使教授太太吃惊的是，凯西莉的态度竟那么厚颜无耻，公然提出得任她自行其是，如果她高兴同那位中国先生一起散步，她看不出这同旁人有何相于，这本是她自己的事嘛。教授太太威胁说要给她伯父写信。 \n \n \"那亨利希伯父就会送我到柏林的某户人家去过冬，这对我来说岂非更好！宋先生也会去柏林的嘛。\" \n \n 教授太太开始号啕起来，眼泪沿着红通通的、又粗又肥的腮帮子扑籁扑簌往下掉，凯西莉却还在一个劲儿取笑她。 \n \n \"那就是说，整个冬天要有三间屋子空着罗，\"她说。 \n \n 接着，教授太太变换对策，想用软功来打动凯西莉的柔肠：说她善良，理智，忍让；不该再拿她当女孩子看待，她已经是个大人啦。教授太太说，要不是姓宋的，事情本不会这么糟嘛，黄皮肤，塌鼻梁，一对小小的猪眼睛，这才是使人惶恐不安的症结所在。想到那副尊容，就叫人恶心。 \n \n \"Bitte，Bitte！\"凯西莉说，一面喘着粗气，\"别人讲他讲话，我一句也不要听。\" \n \n \"这话你只是说说的吧？\"欧林太太倒抽着凉气。 \n \n \"我爱他！我爱他！我爱他！\" \n \n \"Gott in Himmel！\" \n \n 教授太太神色惊恐地冲着凯西莉小姐发愣。她原以为这一切无非是女孩子的淘气，一场无知的胡闹罢了。然而，她话音里情感之热切，泄露了全部真情。凯西莉用那双灼热的眼睛，端详了教授太太一番，然后肩膀一耸，扬长而去。 \n \n 欧林太太绝口不提这次谈话的经过。过了一两天，她把餐席的座次变换了一下。她问宋先生是否愿意坐到她这一头来，始终那么温文尔雅的宋先生欣然从命。凯西莉对这一改变满不在乎。似乎是因为他俩的关系反正在这幢公寓里已是尽人皆知，他们也就越发肆无忌惮。现在，他们不再瞒着人偷偷地一起出外散步，而是每天下午都大大咧咧地到小山同那儿溜达。显然，他们已不在乎旁人的说三道四。闹到最后，甚至连秉性温和的欧林教授也沉不住气了，他坚持要妻子同那个姓宋的谈一次。教授太太这回把宋先生拉到一边，对他好言规劝：他不该败坏那姑娘的名誉；他正危及整个公寓的名声；他必须明白他的所作所为有多荒唐，有多邪恶。但是，她得到的却是面带微笑的矢口否认；宋先生不知道她说的是什么，他对凯西莉小姐不感兴趣，他从来没同她一起散过步。所有这一切纯属子虚乌有，全是捕风捉影。 \n \n \"啊，宋先生，您怎能这么说呢？人家不止一次看到你们俩在一起。\" \n \n \"不，您搞错了。哪有这种事呢。\" \n \n 他始终笑眯眯地望着教授太太，露出一口整齐、洁白的细牙。他泰然自若，什么也不认帐。他厚脸而又文雅地百般抵赖。最后，教授太太冒火了，说那姑娘自己也承认爱上他了。但是宋先生还是不动声色，脸上仍旧挂着微笑。 \n \n \"扯淡！扯淡！根本没这种事。\" \n \n 教授太太从他嘴里掏不出一句实话来。天气渐渐变得十分恶劣，又是下雪，又是降霜。然后，冰融雪化，一连好几天，让人感到没精打采，出外散步也变得索然无味。一天晚上，菲利普刚上完教授先生的德语课，站在客厅里同欧林太太说话，还没说上几句，只见安娜急匆匆地跑了进来。 \n \n \"妈妈，凯西莉在哪儿？\"她说。 \n \n \"大概在她自己房间里吧。\" \n \n \"她房间里没有灯光。\" \n \n 教授大大惊叫一声，神情沮丧地望着女儿。安娜脑袋里的念头也在她脑际闪过。 \n \n \"打铃叫埃米尔上这儿来，\"她嗓音嘶哑地说。 \n \n 埃米尔是个笨头笨脑的愣小子，吃饭时，他在桌旁伺候，平时屋里的大部分活计都丢给他一个人干。他应声走了进来。 \n \n \"埃米尔，到楼下宋先生的房间去，进去时别敲门。要是里面有人，你就说是来照看火炉的。\" \n \n 在埃米尔呆板的脸上，不见有半点惊讶的表示。 \n \n 他慢腾腾地走下楼去。教授太太母女俩任房门开着，留神楼下的动静。不一会儿，他们听见埃米尔又上楼来了，他们忙招呼他。 \n \n \"屋里有人吗？\"教授太太问。 \n \n \"宋先生在那儿。\" \n \n \"就他一个人吗？\" \n \n 他抿起嘴，脸上绽出一丝狡黠的微笑。 \n \n \"不，凯西莉小姐也在那儿。\" \n \n \"哟，真丢人，\"教授太太叫了起来。 \n \n 这会儿，埃米尔咧嘴笑了。 \n \n \"凯西莉小姐每天晚上都在那儿。一呆就是几个小时。\" \n \n 教授太太开始绞扭双手。 \n \n \"哟，真可恶！你为什么不早点告诉我？\" \n \n \"这。可不关我的事，\"他回答，同时慢腾腾地耸了耸肩。 \n \n \"我看他们一定赏了你不少钱吧，走开！走吧！\" \n \n 他脚步蹒跚地向门口走去。 \n \n \"一定得把他们撵走，妈妈，\"安娜说。 \n \n \"那让谁来付房租呢？税单就要到期了。得把他们撵走，说得多轻巧！可是他们一走，我拿什么来付帐。\"她转身面朝菲利普，脸上挂着两串热泪。\"哎，凯里先生，您不会把听到的话声张出去吧。假如让福斯特小姐知道了，\"--就是那位荷兰老处女--\"假如让福斯特小姐知道了，她会立刻离开这儿的。假如大家都跑了，咱们就只好关门大吉。我实在无力维持下去。\" \n \n \"我当然什么也不会说的。\" \n \n \"如果让她再在这儿呆下去，我可不愿再理睬她了，\"安娜说。 \n \n 那天晚上吃饭时，凯西莉小姐准时人席就座。她脸色比平日红此，带着一股执拗的神情。但是宋先生没有露面，菲利普暗自思忖，他今天是有意要躲开这个难堪的局面吧。不料最后宋先生还是来了，满脸堆笑，一双眼睛忽溜忽溜转着，为自己的概栅来迟不住连声道歉。他还是像往常一样，硬要给教授太太斟一杯他订的摩泽尔葡萄酒，另外还给福斯特小姐斟了一杯。屋子里很热，因为炉子整天烧着，窗户又难得打开。埃米尔慌慌张张地奔来跑去，不过手脚倒还算麻利，好歹把席上的人挨个儿应付了过去。三位老太太坐在那儿不吭声，一脸不以为然的神气；教授太太哭了一场，似乎还没恢复过来；她丈夫不言不语，闷闷不乐。大家都懒得启口。菲利普恍惚觉得，在这伙一日三餐与他共坐一席的人身上，似乎有着某种令人胆寒的东西，在餐室那两盏吊灯的映照下，他们看上去同往常有些异样，菲利普隐隐感到局促不安。有一回，他的目光偶然同凯西莉小姐相遇，他觉得她的目光里射出仇恨与轻蔑。屋子里空气沉闷，压得人透不过气来，似乎大家被这对情人的兽欲搞得心神不宁；周围有一种东方人堕落的特有气氛：炷香袅袅，幽香阵阵，还有窃玉偷香的神秘味儿，似乎逼得人直喘粗气。菲利普感觉得到额头上的脉管在搏动。他自己也不明白，究竟是什么奇怪的感情搞得他如此心慌意乱，他似乎觉得有什么东西在极其强烈地吸引他，而同时又引起他内心的反感和惶恐。 \n \n 这种局面延续了好几天，整个气氛令人恶心，人们感到周围充斥着那股违反常理的情欲，小小客寓中所有人的神经都被拉得紧紧的，似乎一碰即崩。只有宋先生神态如故，逢人还像以前那么笑容满面，那么和蔼可亲，那么彬彬有引。谁也说不准他的那种神态算是文明的胜利呢，还是东方人对于败倒在他们脚下的西方世界的一种轻蔑表示。凯西莉则四处招摇副玩世不恭的神气。最后，这种局面甚至连教授太太也感到忍无可忍了。惊恐之感突然攫住她心头，因为欧林教授用极其严峻的坦率的口气向她她点明，这一众人皆知的私通事件。可能会引起什么样的后果。这件丑事说不定会闹得满城风雨，而她就得眼睁睁看着自己在海德堡的好名声，连同自己一生惨淡经营的寄宿公寓的良好声誉毁于一旦。不知怎地，她也许是被一些蝇头小利迷住了心窍，竟一直没想到这种。可能性。而现在，她又因极度的恐惧而乱了套套，几乎忍不住要立时把这姑娘撵出门去。多了安娜还算有见识，给柏林的那位伯父写了封措辞谨慎的信，建议地把凯西莉领走。 \n \n 但是，教授太太在横下心决计忍痛牺牲这两个房客之后，再也憋不住心头的一股于怨气，非要痛痛快快地发泄一通不可--她已经克制了好久啦。现在她可以当着凯西莉的面，爱怎么说就怎么说。 \n \n \"我已经写信给你伯父了，凯西莉，要他来把你领走。我不能再让你在我屋里呆下去。\" \n \n 教授太太注意到那姑娘脸色刷地发白，自己那双溜圆的小眼睛禁不住一闪一闪发亮。 \n \n \"你真不要脸，死不要脸，\"她继续说。 \n \n 她把凯西莉臭骂了一顿。 \n \n \"您对我的亨利希伯父说了些什么呢，教授太太？\"姑娘问，原先那股扬扬自得、梁骛不驯的神气突然化为乌有了。 \n \n \"噢，他会当面告诉你的。估计明天就能收到他的回信。\" \n \n 第二天，教授太太为了要让凯西莉当众出丑，故意在吃晚饭时拉开嗓门，冲着坐在餐席下首的那姑娘大声嚷嚷。 \n \n \"我已经收到你伯父的来信啦，凯西莉。你今晚就给我把行李收抬好，明天一早，我们送你上火车。他会亲自到中央车站去接你的。\" \n \n \"太好了，教授太太。\" \n \n 教授太太看到宋先生仍然满脸堆笑，尽管她再三拒绝，他还是硬给她斟了一杯酒。这顿饭，教授太太吃得津津有味。虽说她一时占了上风，可到头来还是失算了。就在就寝之前，她把仆人唤到跟前。 \n \n \"埃米尔，要是凯西莉小姐的行李箱已经收拾停当，你最好今晚就把它拿到楼下去。明天早饭之前，脚夫要来取的。\" \n \n 仆人走开不多一会儿，又回来了。 \n \n \"凯西莉小姐不在她房里，她的手提包也不见了。\" \n \n 教授太太大叫一声，拔脚就往凯西莉的房间跑去：箱子放在地板上，已经捆扎好而且上了锁，但是手提包不见了，帽子、斗篷也不知去向。梳妆台上空空如也。教授太太喘着粗气，飞步下楼，直奔姓宋的房间。她已有二十年没这么健步如飞了。埃米尔在她背后连声呼喊，要她当心别摔倒。她连门也顾不得敲，径直往里面闯。房间里空荡荡的，行李已不翼而飞，那扇通向花园的门豁然洞开着，说明行李是从那儿搬出去的。桌上放着一只信封，里面有几张钞票，算是偿付这个月的膳宿费和外加的一笔小费。教授太太由于刚才的疾步飞奔，这时突然支撑不住，她嘴里呻吟着，胖乎乎的身躯颓然倒在沙发里。事情再清楚不过了：那对情人双双私奔了。埃米尔仍旧是那么一副木然、无动于衷的神态。
