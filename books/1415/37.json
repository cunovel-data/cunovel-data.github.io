{"id":20021,"no":37,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVII. HOOK COURT.","content":"Mr. Dobbs Broughton and Mr. Musselboro were sitting together on a certain morning at their office in the City, discussing the affairs of their joint business. The City office was a very poor place indeed, in comparison with the fine house which Mr. Dobbs occupied at the West End; but then City offices are poor places, and there are certain City occupations which seem to enjoy the greater credit the poorer are the material circumstances by which they are surrounded. Turning out of a lane which turns out of Lombard Street, there is a desolate, forlorn-looking, dark alley, which is called Hook Court. The entrance to this alley is beneath the first-floor of one of the houses in the lane, and in passing under this covered way the visitor to the place finds himself in a small paved square court, at the two further corners of which there are two open doors; for in Hook Court there are only two houses. There is No. 1, Hook Court, and No. 2, Hook Court. The entire premises indicated by No. 1, are occupied by a firm of wine and spirit merchants, in connexion with whose trade one side and two angles of the court are always lumbered with crates, hampers, and wooden cases. And nearly in the middle of the court, though somewhat more to the wine-merchants\u0027 side than to the other, there is always gaping open a trap-door, leading down to vaults below; and over the trap there is a great board with a bright advertisement in very large letters:— \n \n \n BURTON AND BANGLES \n HIMALAYA WINES, \n 22s 6d per dozen. \n \n \n And this notice is so bright and so large, and the trap-door is so conspicuous in the court, that no visitor, even to No. 2, ever afterwards can quite divest his memory of those names, Burton and Bangles, Himalaya wines. It may therefore be acknowledged that Burton and Bangles have achieved their object in putting up the notice. The house No. 2, small as it seems to be, standing in the jamb of a corner, is divided among different occupiers, whose names are painted in small letters upon the very dirty posts of the doorway. Nothing can be more remarkable than the contrast between Burton and Bangles and these other City gentlemen in the method taken by them in declaring their presence to visitors in the court. The names of Dobbs Broughton and of A. Musselboro,—the Christian name of Mr. Musselboro was Augustus,—were on one of those dirty posts, not joined together by any visible \"and,\" so as to declare boldly that they were partners; but in close vicinity,—showing at least that the two gentlemen would be found in apartments very near to each other. And on the first-floor of this house Dobbs Broughton and his friend did occupy three rooms,—or rather two rooms and a closet—between them. The larger and front room was tenanted by an old clerk, who sat within a rail in one corner of it. And there was a broad, short counter which jutted out from the wall into the middle of the room, intended for the use of such of the public as might come to transact miscellaneous business with Dobbs Broughton or Augustus Musselboro. But any one accustomed to the look of offices might have seen with half an eye that very little business was ever done on that counter. Behind this large room was a smaller one, belonging to Dobbs Broughton, in the furnishing and arrangement of which some regard had been paid to comfort. The room was carpeted, and there was a sofa in it, though a very old one, and two arm-chairs and a mahogany office-table, and a cellaret, which was generally well supplied with wine which Dobbs Broughton did not get out of the vaults of his neighbours, Burton and Bangles. Behind this again, but with a separate entrance from the passage, was the closet; and this closet was specially devoted to the use of Mr. Musselboro. Closet as it was,—or cupboard as it might almost have been called,—it contained a table and two chairs; and it had a window of its own, which opened out upon a blank wall which was distant from it not above four feet. As the house to which this wall belonged was four stories high, it would sometimes happen that Mr. Musselboro\u0027s cupboard was rather dark. But this mattered the less as in these days Mr. Musselboro seldom used it. Mr. Musselboro, who was very constant at his place of business,—much more constant than his friend, Dobbs Broughton,—was generally to be found in his friend\u0027s room. Only on some special occasions, on which it was thought expedient that the commercial world should be made to understand that Mr. Augustus Musselboro had an individual existence of his own, did that gentleman really seat himself in the dark closet. Mr. Dobbs Broughton, had he been asked what was his trade, would have said that he was a stockbroker; and he would have answered truly, for he was a stockbroker. A man may be a stockbroker though he never sells any stock; as he may be a barrister though he has no practice at the bar. I do not say that Mr. Broughton never sold any stock; but the buying and selling of stock for other people was certainly not his chief business. And had Mr. Musselboro been asked what was his trade, he would have probably given an evasive answer. At any rate in the City, and among people who understood City matters, he would not have said that he was a stockbroker. Both Mr. Broughton and Mr. Musselboro bought and sold a good deal, but it was chiefly on account. The shares which were bought and sold very generally did not pass from hand to hand; but the difference in the price of the shares did do so. And then they had another little business between them. They lent money on interest. And in this business there was a third partner, whose name did not appear on the dirty door-post. That third partner was Mrs. Van Siever, the mother of Clara Van Siever whom Mr. Conway Dalrymple intended to portray as Jael driving a nail into Sisera\u0027s head. \n \n On a certain morning Mr. Broughton and Mr. Musselboro were sitting together in the office which has been described. They were in Mr. Broughton\u0027s room, and occupied each an arm-chair on the different sides of the fire. Mr. Musselboro was sitting close to the table, on which a ledger was open before him, and he had a pen and ink before him, as though he had been at work. Dobbs Broughton had a small betting-book in his hand, and was seated with his feet up against the side of the fireplace. Both men wore their hats, and the aspect of the room was not the aspect of a place of business. They had been silent for some minutes when Broughton took his cigar-case out of his pocket, and nibbled off the end of a cigar, preparatory to lighting it. \n \n \"You had better not smoke here this morning, Dobbs,\" said Musselboro. \n \n \"Why shouldn\u0027t I smoke in my own room?\" \n \n \"Because she\u0027ll be here just now.\" \n \n \"What do I care? If you think I\u0027m going to be afraid of Mother Van, you\u0027re mistaken. Let come what may, I\u0027m not going to live under her thumb.\" So he lighted his cigar. \n \n \"All right,\" said Musselboro, and he took up his pen and went to work at his book. \n \n \"What is she coming here for this morning?\" asked Broughton. \n \n \"To look after her money. What should she come for?\" \n \n \"She gets her interest. I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s better paid money in the City.\" \n \n \"She hasn\u0027t got what was coming to her at Christmas yet.\" \n \n \"And this is February. What would she have? She had better put her dirty money into the three per cents., if she is frightened at having to wait a week or two.\" \n \n \"Can she have it to-day?\" \n \n \"What, the whole of it? Of course she can\u0027t. You know that as well as I do. She can have four hundred pounds, if she wants it. But seeing all she gets out of the concern, she has no right to press for it in that way. She is the —— old usurer I ever came across in my life.\" \n \n \"Of course she likes her money.\" \n \n \"Likes her money! By George she does; her own and anybody else\u0027s that she can get hold of. For a downright leech, recommend me always to a woman. When a woman does go in for it, she is much more thorough than any man.\" Then Broughton turned over the little pages of his book, and Musselboro pondered over the big pages of his book, and there was silence for a quarter of an hour. \n \n \"There\u0027s something about nine hundred and fifteen pounds due to her,\" said Musselboro. \n \n \"I daresay there is.\" \n \n \"It would be a very good thing to let her have it if you\u0027ve got it. The whole of it this morning, I mean.\" \n \n \"If! yes, if!\" said Broughton. \n \n \"I know there\u0027s more than that at the bank.\" \n \n \"And I\u0027m to draw out every shilling that there is! I\u0027ll see Mother Van—further first. She can have ￡500 if she likes it,—and the rest in a fortnight. Or she can have my note-of-hand for it all at fourteen days.\" \n \n \"She won\u0027t like that at all,\" said Musselboro. \n \n \"Then she must lump it. I\u0027m not going to bother myself about her. I\u0027ve pretty nearly as much money in it as she has, and we\u0027re in a boat together. If she comes here bothering, you\u0027d better tell her so.\" \n \n \"You\u0027ll see her yourself?\" \n \n \"Not unless she comes within the next ten minutes. I must go down to the court. I said I\u0027d be there by twelve. I\u0027ve got somebody I want to see.\" \n \n \"I\u0027d stay if I were you.\" \n \n \"Why should I stay for her? If she thinks that I\u0027m going to make myself her clerk, she\u0027s mistaken. It may be all very well for you, Mussy, but it won\u0027t do for me. I\u0027m not dependent on her, and I don\u0027t want to marry her daughter.\" \n \n \"It will simply end in her demanding to have her money back again.\" \n \n \"And how will she get it?\" said Dobbs Broughton. \"I haven\u0027t a doubt in life but she\u0027d take it to-morrow if she could put her hands upon it. And then, after a bit, when she began to find that she didn\u0027t like four per cent., she\u0027d bring it back again. But nobody can do business after such a fashion as that. For the last three years she\u0027s drawn close upon two thousand a year for less than eighteen thousand pounds. When a woman wants to do that, she can\u0027t have her money in her pocket every Monday morning.\" \n \n \"But you\u0027ve done better than that yourself, Dobbs.\" \n \n \"Of course I have. And who has made the connexion; and who has done the work? I suppose she doesn\u0027t think that I\u0027m to have all the sweat and that she is to have all the profit.\" \n \n \"If you talk of work, Dobbs, it is I that have done the most of it.\" This Mr. Musselboro said in a very serious voice, and with a look of much reproach. \n \n \"And you\u0027ve been paid for what you\u0027ve done. Come, Mussy, you\u0027d better not turn against me. You\u0027ll never get your change out of that. Even if you marry the daughter, that won\u0027t give you the mother\u0027s money. She\u0027ll stick to every shilling of it till she dies; and she\u0027d take it with her then, if she knew how.\" Having said this, he got up from his chair, put his little book into his pocket, and walked out of the office. He pushed his way across the court, which was more than ordinarily crowded with the implements of Burton and Bangles\u0027 trade, and as he passed under the covered way he encountered at the entrance an old woman getting out of a cab. The old woman was, of course, Mother Van, as her partner, Mr. Dobbs Broughton, irreverently called her. \"Mrs. Van Siever, how d\u0027ye do? Let me give you a hand. Fare from South Kensington? I always give the fellows three shillings.\" \n \n \"You don\u0027t mean to tell me it\u0027s six miles!\" And she tendered a florin to the man. \n \n \"Can\u0027t take that, ma\u0027am,\" said the cabman. \n \n \"Can\u0027t take it! But you must take it. Broughton, just get a policeman, will you?\" Dobbs Broughton satisfied the driver out of his own pocket, and the cab was driven away. \"What did you give him?\" said Mrs. Van Siever. \n \n \"Just another sixpence. There never is a policeman anywhere about here.\" \n \n \"It\u0027ll be out of your own pocket, then,\" said Mrs. Van. \"But you\u0027re not going away?\" \n \n \"I must be at Capel Court by half-past twelve;—I must, indeed. If it wasn\u0027t real business, I\u0027d stay.\" \n \n \"I told Musselboro I should be here.\" \n \n \"He\u0027s up there, and he knows all about the business just as well as I do. When I found that I couldn\u0027t stay for you, I went through the account with him, and it\u0027s all settled. Good morning. I\u0027ll see you at the West End in a day or two.\" Then he made his way out into Lombard Street, and Mrs. Van Siever picked her steps across the yard, and mounted the stairs, and made her way into the room in which Mr. Musselboro was sitting. \n \n \"Somebody\u0027s been smoking, Gus,\" she said, almost as soon as she had entered the room. \n \n \"That\u0027s nothing new here,\" he replied, as he got up from his chair. \n \n \"There\u0027s no good being done when men sit and smoke over their work. Is it you, or he, or both of you?\" \n \n \"Well;—it was Broughton was smoking just now. I don\u0027t smoke of a morning myself.\" \n \n \"What made him get up and run away when I came?\" \n \n \"How can I tell, Mrs. Van Siever,\" said Musselboro, laughing. \"If he did run away when you came, I suppose it was because he didn\u0027t want to see you.\" \n \n \"And why shouldn\u0027t he want to see me? Gus, I expect the truth from you. How are things going on here?\" To this question Mr. Musselboro made no immediate answer; but tilted himself back in his chair and took his hat off, and put his thumbs into the arm-holes of his waistcoat, and looked his patroness full in the face. \"Gus,\" she said again, \"I do expect the truth from you. How are things going on here?\" \n \n \"There\u0027d be a good business,—if he\u0027d only keep things together.\" \n \n \"But he\u0027s idle. Isn\u0027t he idle?\" \n \n \"Confoundedly idle,\" said Musselboro. \n \n \"And he drinks;—don\u0027t he drink in the day?\" \n \n \"Like the mischief,—some days. But that isn\u0027t the worst of it.\" \n \n \"And what is the worst of it?\" \n \n \"Newmarket;—that\u0027s the rock he\u0027s going to pieces on.\" \n \n \"You don\u0027t mean to say he takes the money out of the business for that?\" And Mrs. Van Siever\u0027s face, as she asked the question, expressed almost a tragic horror. \"If I thought that I wouldn\u0027t give him an hour\u0027s mercy.\" \n \n \"When a man bets he doesn\u0027t well know what money he uses. I can\u0027t say that he takes money that is not his own. Situated as I am, I don\u0027t know what is his own and what isn\u0027t. If your money was in my name I could keep a hand on it;—but as it is not I can do nothing. I can see that what is put out is put out fairly well; and when I think of it, Mrs. Van Siever, it is quite wonderful that we\u0027ve lost so little. It has been next to nothing. That has been my doing;—and that\u0027s about all that I can do.\" \n \n \"You must know whether he has used my money for his own purposes or not.\" \n \n \"If you ask me, I think he has,\" said Mr. Musselboro. \n \n \"Then I\u0027ll go into it, and I\u0027ll find it out, and if it is so, as sure as my name\u0027s Van Siever, I\u0027ll sew him up.\" Having uttered which terrible threat, the old woman drew a chair to the table and seated herself fairly down, as though she were determined to go through all the books of the office before she quitted that room. Mrs. Van Siever in her present habiliments was not a thing so terrible to look at as she had been in her wiggeries at Mrs. Dobbs Broughton\u0027s dinner-table. Her curls were laid aside altogether, and she wore simply a front beneath her close bonnet,—and a very old front, too, which was not loudly offensive because it told no lies. Her eyes were as bright, and her little wizen face was as sharp, as ever; but the wizen face and the bright eyes were not so much amiss as seen together with the old dark brown silk dress which she now wore, as they had been with the wiggeries and the evening finery. Even now, in her morning costume, in her work-a-day business dress, as we may call it, she looked to be very old,—so old that nobody could guess her age. People attempting to guess would say that she must be at least over eighty. And yet she was wiry, and strong, and nimble. It was not because she was feeble that she was thought to be so old. They who so judged of her were led to their opinion by the extreme thinness of her face, and by the brightness of her eyes, joined to the depth of the hollows in which they lay, and the red margin by which they were surrounded. It was not really the fact that Mrs. Van Siever was so very aged, for she had still some years to live before she would reach eighty, but that she was such a weird old woman, so small, so ghastly, and so ugly! \"I\u0027ll sew him up, if he\u0027s been robbing me,\" she said. \"I will, indeed.\" And she stretched out her hand to grab at the ledger which Musselboro had been using. \n \n \"You won\u0027t understand anything from that,\" said he, pushing the book over to her. \n \n \"You can explain it to me.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s all straight sailing, that is.\" \n \n \"And where does he keep the figures that ain\u0027t straight sailing? That\u0027s the book I want to see.\" \n \n \"There is no such book.\" \n \n \"Look here, Gus,—if I find you deceiving me I\u0027ll throw you overboard as sure as I\u0027m a living woman. I will indeed. I\u0027ll have no mercy. I\u0027ve stuck to you, and made a man of you, and I expect you to stick to me.\" \n \n \"Not much of a man,\" said Musselboro, with a touch of scorn in his voice. \n \n \"You\u0027ve never had a shilling yet but what I gave you.\" \n \n \"Yes; I have. I\u0027ve had what I\u0027ve worked for,—and worked confounded hard too.\" \n \n \"Look here, Musselboro; if you\u0027re going to throw me over, just tell me so, and let us begin fair.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m not going to throw you over. I\u0027ve always been on the square with you. Why don\u0027t you trust me out and out, and then I could do a deal better for you. You ask me now about your money. I don\u0027t know about your money, Mrs. Van Siever. How am I to know anything about your money, Mrs. Van Siever? You don\u0027t give me any power of keeping a hand upon Dobbs Broughton. I suppose you have security from Dobbs Broughton, but I don\u0027t know what security you have, Mrs. Van Siever. He owes you now ￡915 16s. 2d. on last year\u0027s account!\" \n \n \"Why doesn\u0027t he give me a cheque for the money?\" \n \n \"He says he can\u0027t spare it. You may have ￡500, and the rest when he can give it you. Or he\u0027ll give you his note-of-hand at fourteen days for the whole.\" \n \n \"Bother his note-of-hand. Why should I take his note-of-hand?\" \n \n \"Do as you like, Mrs. Van Siever.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s the interest on my own money. Why don\u0027t he give it me? I suppose he has had it.\" \n \n \"You must ask him that, Mrs. Van Siever. You\u0027re in partnership with him, and he can tell you. Nobody else knows anything about it. If you were in partnership with me, then of course I could tell you. But you\u0027re not. You\u0027ve never trusted me, Mrs. Van Siever.\" \n \n The lady remained there closeted with Mr. Musselboro for an hour after that, and did, I think, at length learn something more as to the details of her partner\u0027s business, than her faithful servant Mr. Musselboro had at first found himself able to give to her. And at last they came to friendly and confidential terms, in the midst of which the personal welfare of Mr. Dobbs Broughton was, I fear, somewhat forgotten. Not that Mr. Musselboro palpably and plainly threw his friend overboard. He took his friend\u0027s part,—alleging excuses for him, and pleading some facts. \"Of course, you know, a man like that is fond of pleasure, Mrs. Van Siever. He\u0027s been at it more or less all his life. I don\u0027t suppose he ever missed a Derby or an Oaks, or the cup at Ascot, or the Goodwood in his life.\" \"He\u0027ll have to miss them before long, I\u0027m thinking,\" said Mrs. Van Siever. \"And as to not cashing up, you must remember, Mrs. Van Siever, that ten per cent. won\u0027t come in quite as regularly as four or five. When you go for high interest, there must be hitches here and there. There must, indeed, Mrs. Van Siever.\" \"I know all about it,\" said Mrs. Van Siever. \"If he gave it me as soon as he got it himself, I shouldn\u0027t complain. Never mind. He\u0027s only got to give me my little bit of money out of the business, and then he and I will be all square. You come and see Clara this evening, Gus.\" \n \n Then Mr. Musselboro put Mrs. Van Siever into another cab, and went out upon \u0027Change,—hanging about the Bank, and standing in Threadneedle Street, talking to other men just like himself. When he saw Dobbs Broughton he told that gentleman that Mrs. Van Siever had been in her tantrums, but that he had managed to pacify her before she left Hook Court. \"I\u0027m to take her the cheque for the five hundred to-night,\" he said. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2726/75059.html","bookId":1415,"book":{"id":1415,"title":"The Last Chronicle of Barset","description":"简介： Illustration can never bring myself to believe it, John, said Mary Walker, the pretty daughter of Mr. George Walker, attorney of Silverbridge.
