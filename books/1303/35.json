{"id":38968,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER XXXV","content":"UP and down went the great Roldan scission. Up and down went Indian revolt, repression, fresh revolt, fresh repression. On flowed time. Ships came in, one bearing Don Diego; ships went out. Time passed. Alonso de Ojeda, who by now was no more than half his friend, returned to Spain and there proposed to the Sovereigns a voyage of his own to that Southern Continent that never had the Admiral chance to return to! The Sovereigns now were giving such consent to this one and to that one, breaking their pact with Christopherus Columbus. In our world it was now impossible that that pact should be letter-kept, but the Genoese did not see it so. Ojeda sailed from Cadiz for Paria with four ships and a concourse of adventurers. With him went the pilot Juan de la Cosa, and a geographer of Florence, Messer Amerigo Vespucci. \\n\\n \\n\\n It came to us in Hispaniola that Ojeda was gone. Now I saw the Admiral\u0027s heart begin to break. Yet Ojeda in his voyage did not find the Earthly Paradise, only went along that coast as we had done, gathered pearls, and returned. \\n\\n \\n\\n Time passed. Other wild and restless adventurers beside Roldan broke into insurrections less than Roldan\u0027s. The Viceroy hanged Moxica and seven with him, and threw into prison Guevara and Requelme. Roldan, having had his long fling—too powerful still to hang or to chain in some one of our forts—Roldan wrote and received permission, and came to San Domingo, and was reconciled. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly, after long time of turmoil, wild adventure and uncertainty, peace descended. Over all Hispaniola the Indians submitted. Henceforth they were our subjects; let us say our victims and our slaves! Quarrels between Castilians died over night. Miraculously the sky cleared. Miraculously, or perhaps because of long, patient steering through storm. For three months we lived with an appearance of blossoming and prospering. It seemed that it might become a peaceful, even a happy island. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Viceroy grew younger, the Adelantado grew younger, and Don Diego, and with them those who held by them through thick and thin. The Admiral began to talk Discovery. It was two years since there, far to the south, we had passed in by the Mouth of the Serpent, and out by the Mouth of the Dragon. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Viceroy, inspecting the now quiet Vega, rode to an Indian village, near Concepcion. He had twenty behind him, well-armed, but arms were not needed. The people came about him with an eagerness, a docility. They told their stories. He sat his horse and listened with a benignant face. Certain harshnesses in times and amounts of their tribute he redressed. Forever, when personal appeal came to him, he proved magnanimous, often tender, fatherly and brotherly. At a distance he could be severe. But when I think of the cruelties and high-handedness of others here, the Adelantado and the Viceroy shine mildly. \\n\\n \\n\\n We rode back to Concepcion. I remember the jewel-like air that day, the flowers, the trees, the sky. Palms rustled above us, the brilliant small lizards darted around silver trunks. \"The fairest day!\" quoth the Admiral. \"Ease at heart! I feel ease at heart.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This night, as I sat beside him, wiling him to sleep, for he always had trouble sleeping—a most wakeful man!—he talked to me about the Queen. Toward this great woman he ever showed veneration, piety, and knightly regard. Of all in Spain she it was who best understood and shared that religious part in him that breathed upward, inspired, longed and strained toward worlds truly not on the earthly map. She, like him—or so took leave to think Juan Lepe—received at times too docilely word of authority, or that which they reckoned to be authority. Princes of the Church could bring her to go against her purer thought. The world as it is, dinging ever, \"So important is wealth—so important is herald-nobility—so important is father-care in these respects for sons!\" could make him take a tortuous and complicated way, could make him bow and cap, could make him rule with an ear for world\u0027s advice when he should have had only his book and his ship and his dream and a cheering cry \"Onward!\" Or so thinks Juan Lepe. But Juan Lepe and all wait on full light. \\n\\n \\n\\n He talked of her great nature, and her goodness to him. Of how she understood when the King would not. Of how she would never listen to his enemies, or at the worst not listen long. \\n\\n \\n\\n He turned upon his bed in the warm Indian night. I asked him if I should read to him but he said, not yet. He had talked since the days of his first seeking with many a great lord, aye, and great lady. But the Queen was the one of them all who understood best how to trust a man! Differences in mind arose within us all, and few could find the firm soul behind all that! She could, and she was great because she could. He loved to talk with her. Her face lighted when he came in. When others were by she said \"Don Cristoval\", or \"El Almirante\", but with himself alone she still said \"Master Christopherus\" as in the old days. \\n\\n \\n\\n At last he said, \"Now, let us read.\" Each time he came from Spain to Hispaniola he brought books. And when ships came in there would be a packet for him. I read to him now from an old poet, printed in Venice. He listened, then at last he slept. I put out the candle, stepped softly forth past Gonsalvo his servant, lying without door. \\n\\n \\n\\n An hour after dawn a small cavalcade appeared before the fort. At first we thought it was the Adelantado from Xaragua. But no! it was Alonzo de Carvajal with news and a letter from San Domingo, and in the very statement ran a thrilling something that said, \"Hark, now! I am Fortune that turns the wheel.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Carvajal said, \"senor, I have news and a letter for your ear and eye alone!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"From my brother at San Domingo?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aye, and from another,\" said Carvajal. \"Two ships have come in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With that the Admiral and he went into Commandant\u0027s house. \\n\\n \\n\\n The men at Concepcion made Carvajal\u0027s men welcome. \"And what is it?\" \"And what is it?\" They had their orders evidently, but much wine leaked out of the cask. If one wished the Viceroy and his brothers ill, it was found to be heady wine; if the other way round, it seemed thin, chilly and bitter. Here at Concepcion were Admiral\u0027s friends. \\n\\n \\n\\n After an hour he came again among us, behind him Carvajal. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now, this man, Christopherus Columbus, always appeared most highly and nobly Man, most everlasting and universal, in great personal trouble and danger. It was, I hold, because nothing was to him smally personal, but always pertained to great masses, to worlds and to ages. Now, looking at him, I knew that trouble and danger had arrived. He said very little. If I remember, it was, \"My friends, the Sovereigns whom we trust and obey, have sent a Commissioner, Don Francisco de Bobadilla, whom we must go meet. We ride from Concepcion at once to Bonao.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n We rode, his company and Carvajal\u0027s company. \\n\\n \\n\\n Don Francisco de Bobadilla! Jayme de Marchena had some association here. It disentangled itself, came at last clear. A Commander of the Order of Calatrava—about the King in some capacity—able and honest, men said. Able and honest, Jayme de Marchena had heard said, but also a passionate man, and a vindictive, and with vanity enough for a legion of peacocks. \\n\\n \\n\\n We came to Bonao and rested here. I had a word that night from the Admiral. \"Doctor, Doctor, a man must outlook storm! He grew man by that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I asked if I might know what was the matter. \\n\\n \\n\\n He answered, \"I do not know myself. Don Diego says that great powers have been granted Don Francisco de Bobadilla. I have not seen those powers. But he has demanded in the name of the Sovereigns our prisoners, our ships and towns and forts, and has cited us to appear before him and answer charges—of I know not what! I well think it is a voice without true mind or power behind it—I go to San Domingo, but not just at his citation!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Later, in the moonlight, one of our men told me that which a man of Carvajal had told him. All the Admiral\u0027s enemies, and none ever said they were few, had this fire-new commissioner\u0027s ear! A friend could not get within hail. Just or unjust, every complaint came and squatted in a ring around him. Maybe some were just—such as soldiers not being able to get their pay, for instance. There was never but one who lived without spot or blemish. But of course we knew that the old Admiral wasn\u0027t really a tyrant, cruel and a fool! Of course not. Carvajal\u0027s man was prepared to fight any man of his own class who would say that to his face! He\u0027d fight, too, for the Adelantado. Don Francisco de Bobadilla had no sooner landed than he began to talk and act as though they were all villains. Don Diego—whom it was laughable to call a villain—and all. He went to mass at once—Don Francisco de Bobadilla—and when it was over and all were out and all San Domingo there in the square, he had his letters loudly read. True enough! He is Governor, and everybody else must obey him! Even the Admiral! \\n\\n \\n\\n At dawn Juan Lepe walked and thought. And then he saw coming the Franciscan, Juan de Trasiena and Francisco Velasquez the Treasurer. That which Juan de Trasiena and Francisco Velasquez brought were attested copies of the royal letters. \\n\\n \\n\\n I saw them. \"Wherefore we have named Don Francisco de Bobadilla Governor of these islands and of the main land, and we command you, cavaliers and all persons whatever, to give him that obedience which you do owe to us.\" And to him, the new Governor: \"Whomsoever you find guilty, arrest their persons and take over their goods.\" And, \"If you find it to our service that any cavaliers or other persons who are at present in these islands should leave them, and that they should come and present themselves before us, you may command it in our names and oblige it.\" And, \"Whomsoever you thus command, we hereby order that immediately they obey as though it were ourselves.\" \"And if thus and thus is found to be the case, the said Admiral of the Ocean-Sea shall give into your hands, ships, fortresses, arms, houses and treasure, and he shall himself be obedient to your command.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Admiral said, \"If it be found thus and thus! But how shall he find it, seeing that it is not so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n We rode to San Domingo, but not many rode. He would not have many. \"No show of force, no gaud of office!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He rode unarmored, on his gray horse. The banner that was always borne with him—\"Yea, carry it still, until he demands it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n We were a bare dozen, but when we entered San Domingo one might think that Don Francisco de Bobadilla feared an army, for he had all his soldiers drawn up to greet us! The rest of the population were in coigns, gazing. We saw friends—Juan Ponce de Leon and others—but they were helpless. For all the people in it, the place seemed to me dead quiet, hot, sunny, dead quiet. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Admiral rode to the square. Here was his house, and the royal banner over it. He dismounted and spoke to men before the door. \"Tell Don Francisco de Bobadilla that Don Cristoval Colon is here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There came an officer with a sword, behind him a dozen men. \"Senor, in the name of the Sovereigns, I arrest you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Christopherus Columbus gazed upon him. \"For what, senor?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The other, an arrogant, ill-tempered man, answered loudly so that all around could hear, \"For ill-service to our lord the King and Queen, and to their subjects here in the Indies, and to God!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"God knows, you hurt the truth!\" said the Admiral. \"Where is my brother, Don Diego?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Laid by the heels in the Santa Catarina,\" answered the graceless man; then to one of the soldiers, \"Take the banner from behind him and rest it against the wall.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Admiral said, \"I would see Don Francisco de Bobadilla.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is as he desires and when he desires,\" the other replied. \"Close around him, men!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The fortress of San Domingo is a gloomy place. They prisoned him here, and they put irons upon him. I saw that done. One or two of his immediate following, and I his physician might enter with him. \\n\\n \\n\\n He stood in the dismal place where one ray of light came down from a high, small, grated window, and he looked at the chains which they brought. He asked, \"Who will put them on?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He looked at the chains and at the soldier who brought them. \"Put them on, man!\" he said. \"What! Once thou didst nail God\u0027s foot to a cross! As for me, I will remember that One who saved all, and be patient.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They chained him and left him there in the dark. \\n\\n \\n\\n I saw him the next day, entering with his gaoler. Had he slept? \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did he find himself?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How does my body find itself? Why, no worse than usual, nowadays that I am getting old! My body has been unhappier a thousand times in storm and fight, and thirst and famine.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then mind and soul?\" I asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They are well. There is nothing left for them but to feel well. I am in the hand of God.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I did what service for him I could. He thanked me. \"You\u0027ve been ever as tender as a woman. A brave man besides! I hope you\u0027ll be by me, Juan Lepe, when I die.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When you die, senor, there will die a great servant of the world.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I spoke so because I knew the cordial that he wanted. \\n\\n \\n\\n His eyes brightened, strength came into his voice. \"Do you know aught of my brother the Adelantado?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No. He may be on his way from Xaragua. What would you wish him to do, sir?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come quietly to San Domingo as I came. This Governor is but a violent, petty shape! But I have sworn to obey the Queen and the King of the Spains. I and mine to obey.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I asked him if he believed that the Sovereigns knew this outrage. I could believe it hardly of King Ferdinand, not at all of the Queen. \\n\\n \\n\\n Again I felt that this was cordial to him. I had spoken out of my conviction, and he knew it. \"No,\" he said. \"I do not believe it. I will never believe it of the Queen! Look you! I have thought it out in the night. The night is good for thinking out. You would not believe how many enemies I have in Spain. Margarite and Father Buil are but two of a crowd. Fonseca, who should give me all aid, gives me all hindrance. I have throngs of foes; men who envy me; men who thought I might give them the golden sun, and I could not; hidalgos who hold that God made them to enjoy, standing on other men\u0027s shoulders, eating the grapes and throwing down the empty skins, and I made them to labor like the others; and not in Heaven or Hell will they forgive me! And others—and others. They have turned the King a little their way. I knew that, ere I went to find that great new land where are pearls, that slopes upward by littles to the Height of the World and the Earthly Paradise. Turned the King, but not the Queen. But now I make it they have worked upon her. I make it that she does not know the character of Don Francisco de Bobadilla. I make it that, holding him to be far wiser than he is, she with the King gave him great power as commissioner. I make it that they gave him letters of authority, and a last letter, superseding the Viceroy, naming him Governor whom all must obey. I make it that he was only to use this if after long examination it was found by a wise, just man that I had done after my enemies\u0027 hopes. I make it that here across Ocean-Sea, far, far from Spain, he chose not to wait. He clucked to him all the disaffected and flew with a strong beak at the eyes of my friends.\" He moved his arms and his chains clanked. \"I make it that this severity is Don Francisco de Bobadilla\u0027s, not King Ferdinand\u0027s, not—oh, more than not—the good Queen\u0027s!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Juan Lepe thought that he had made out the probabilities, probably the certainties. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If I may win to Spain!\" he ended. \"It all hinges on that! If I may see the Sovereigns—if I may see the good Queen! I hope to God he will soon chain me in a ship and send me!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Had he seen Don Francisco de Bobadilla? \\n\\n \\n\\n No, he had not seen Don Francisco de Bobadilla. He thought that on the whole that Hidalgo and Commander of Calatrava was afraid. \\n\\n \\n\\n Outside of the fortress that afternoon Juan Lepe kept company with one who had come with the fire-new Governor, a grim, quiet fellow named Pedro Lopez. He and Luis Torres had been neighbors in Spain; it was Luis who brought us together. I gave him some wine in Doctor Juan Lepe\u0027s small room and he told readily the charges against the Viceroy that Bobadilla, seizing, made into a sheaf. \\n\\n \\n\\n Already I knew what they were. I had heard them. One or two had, I thought, faint justification, but the mass, no! Personal avarice, personal greed, paynim luxury, arrogance, cruelty, deceit—it made one sorrowfully laugh who knew the man! Here again clamored the old charge of upstartness. A low-born Italian, son of a wool-comber, vindictive toward the hidalgo, of Spain! But there were new charges. Three men deposed that he neglected Indian salvation. And I heard for the first time that so soon as he found the Grand Khan he meant to give over to that Oriental all the islands and the main, and so betray the Sovereigns and Christ and every Spaniard in these parts! \\n\\n \\n\\n The Adelantado arrived in San Domingo. He came with only a score or two of men, who could have raised many more. Don Francisco de Bobadilla saw to it that he had word from his great brother, and that word was \"Obedience.\" The Adelantado gave his sword to Don Francisco. The latter loaded the first with chains and put him aboard a caravel in the harbor. He asked to be prisoned with his brother; but why ask any magnanimity from an unmagnanimous soul? \\n\\n \\n\\n Out in the open now were all the old insurgents. Guevara and Requelme bowed to the earth when the Governor passed, and Roldan sat with him at wine. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1516/45214.html","bookId":1303,"book":{"id":1303,"title":"1492","description":"简介： THE morning was gray and I sat by the sea near Palos in a gray mood.
