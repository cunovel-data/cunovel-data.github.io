{"id":38978,"no":45,"title":"CHAPTER XLV","content":"DON FERNANDO met me at the door. \"He is wandering—he thinks he is in Cordova with my mother.\" He came from that and said he would get up and go to mass. Persuaded to lie quiet, he talked of his will, drawn before his third voyage, and said that he would have it read to him, and make a codicil. \\n\\n \\n\\n This will. It ran at length through preamble and body. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In the name of the most Holy Trinity who revealed it \\n\\n to me that I could sail westward across Ocean-Sea— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As it pleased God, in the year one thousand, four hundred \\n\\n and ninety-two, I discovered the Continent of the Indies \\n\\n and many islands. I returned to Cadiz to their Majesties \\n\\n who allowed my going a second voyage, and in this God gave \\n\\n me victory over the island of Hispaniola, which covers six \\n\\n hundred leagues, and I conquered it and made it tributary; \\n\\n and I discovered many islands dwelled in by Caribals or \\n\\n eaters of men\u0027s flesh, and also Jamaica which I named \\n\\n Santiago, and three hundred and thirty leagues of Continent \\n\\n from south to west—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He recited his rights, dignities, tithes, emoluments,— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"whereto I have the sacred word of the Sovereigns.\" Then came the heirship. All upon Don Diego and the heirs of his body, with lavish provision for the younger son, \"having great qualities and most dear to me,\" and for the brothers, but more especially the Adelantado. Followed gifts to friends and companions, and then far-flung benefactions. \\n\\n \\n\\n Son and son\u0027s son must give, year following year, a tenth of revenue from the Indies to the help of needy men. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In the city of Genoa in Italy is to be maintained a man and his wife of the line of our family of which he is to be the root in that city, from whence all good may derive unto her, for I was born there and came from thence.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The taking of the Sepulchre. Into the Bank of Saint George in Genoa, \"that noble and potent city\" was to be put what moneys could be saved and collected for the purpose, \"and one day God will bring the purpose about.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His heirs must support the Crown of Spain, \"seeing that these Sovereigns, next to God, are responsible for my achieving the property, though true it is that I came into this country to invite them to the enterprise, and that a long while passed before they allowed me to execute it, but this should not surprise us as it was an undertaking of which all the world was ignorant and no one had any faith in it.\" And if schism arose in Christendom, his heirs must to their uttermost support His Holiness the Pope, and give all and die, if need be, defending the Church of God. And, where it was possible and not contrary to the service and the claims of the Sovereigns of Spain, \"let them give aid and service to that noble city of Genoa from which we all spring.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Such and such moneys, accruing, were to be applied to making fit marriages for the daughters of the line. \\n\\n \\n\\n And let Don Diego his son build in the island of Hispaniola a church and call it Santa Maria de la Concepcion, a church and a hospital and a chapel where masses might be said for the good of the soul of Christopherus Columbus. \"Doubtless God will be pleased to give us revenue enough for this and all purposes.\" And let them maintain in the island of Hispaniola four good teachers of theology to convert to the One Faith the inhabitants of the Indies, \"to which end no expense should be thought too considerable.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Many other things he provided for. He cared for that Dona Beatrix who had given him Fernando. Where he had met kindness, there he gave as best he might. Among other small bequests was a silver mark to a poor Jew who had done him service, who lived at the gate of the Ghetto in Lisbon. He gave to many, and closed his will and signed it with his signet letters and below these, EL ALMIRANTE. \\n\\n \\n\\n After this there came a second leap of the flame. Queen Juana was with her husband, King Phillip, in Laredo,—Queen of Castile as had been the good Queen her mother. The Admiral, utterly revering the Queen who was gone, wrote to the daughter Queen a stately letter of high comfort and offer and promise of service. He would have the Adelantado, no less a man, bear this to Laredo. Don Bartholomew spoke aside to Juan Lepe. \"If I do as he wished, I do not know if I will see him again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do not know,\" I answered. \"But his heart is set on...\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then I will go,\" he said. \"And many\u0027s the time I have thought, \u0027I shall never see him again\u0027, and still we met.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For several days after this I thought that after all he might recover. Perhaps even sail again on earthly discoveries. Then, in a night, came the unmistakable stroke upon the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n He sank, and knew now that he was putting off the body. Fray Juan Perez stayed beside him. His sons and his brother Diego waited with reddened eyes. It was full May, and the bland wind strayed in and out of window and fluttered his many papers upon the great table. It was toward evening of Ascension Day. His son Fernando threw himself on the bed, weeping. The Admiral\u0027s great hand fell upon the youth\u0027s head. He looked to the window and said clearly, \"A light—yonder is a light!\" and after a moment, \"In manus tuas Domine coinmendo spiritum meum.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The sea by Palos and June in Andalusia. Juan Lepe, staying at La Rabida, walked along the sands and saw Life like a mighty, breathing picture. He stood by the sea and the ripples broke at his feet, and he felt and knew the Master of Life, there where feeling and knowing pass into Being. \\n\\n \\n\\n He walked a mile beside Ocean-Sea, then sat down beneath ridged sand with the wind singing over. It sang, Where now, Jayme de Marchena—where now—where now? \\n\\n \\n\\n I sat still. Spain rose behind me, Spain and Europe. Before me, out of sea, lifted the New Lands. There fell a moment of great calm and quiet. Then, fleeting, like a spirit, passed before me the Indian Guarin who had saved me after La Navidad. I saw his dark eyes, then he went. Still space without color or line or form, and outside, dreamily, dreamily, the ocean sounding below La Rabida. Then, in the clear field rose Bartolome de Las Casas. A quiet, singing voice ran through Jayme de Marchena, and he knew that he would return to Hispaniola and link his life with that younger life which apparently had work to do in the Indies. \\n\\n \\n\\n The End \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1516/45224.html","bookId":1303,"book":{"id":1303,"title":"1492","description":"简介： THE morning was gray and I sat by the sea near Palos in a gray mood.
