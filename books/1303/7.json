{"id":38940,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII","content":"DUSK was drawing down as I stole with little trouble out of the house into the street and thence into the maze of Santa Fe. That night I slept with minstrels and jugglers, and at sunrise slipped out of Cordova gate with muleteers. They were for Cordova and I meant to go to Malaga. I meant to find there a ship, maybe for Africa, maybe for Italy, though in Italy, too, sits the Inquisition. But who knows what it is that turns a man, unless we call it his Genius, unless we call it God? I let the muleteers pass me on the road to Cordova, let them dwindle in the distance. And still I walked and did not turn back and find the Malaga road. It was as though I were on the sea, and my bark was hanging in a calm, waiting for a wind to blow. A man mounted on a horse was coming toward me from Santa Fe. Watching the small figure grow larger, I said, \"When he is even with me and has passed and is a little figure again in the distance, I will turn south.\" \n \n He came nearer. Suddenly I knew him to be that Master Christopherus who had entered the wedge of shadow yesterday in the palace court. He was out of it now, in the broad light, on the white road—on the way to France. He approached. The ocean before Palos came and stood again before me, salt and powerful. The keen, far, sky line of it awoke and drew! \n \n Christopherus Columbus came up with me. I said, \"A Palos sailor gives you good morning!\" \n \n Checking the horse, he sat looking at me out of blue-gray eyes. I saw him recollecting. \"Dress is different and poorer, but you are the squire in the crowd! \u0027Sailor Palos sailor\u0027—There\u0027s some meaning there too!\" \n \n He seemed to ponder it, then asked if I was for Cordova. \n \n \"No. I am going to Malaga where I take ship.\" \n \n \"This is not the Malaga road.\" \n \n \"No. But I am in no hurry! I should like to walk a mile with you.\" \n \n \"Then do it,\" he answered. \"Something tells me that we shall not be ill travelers together.\" \n \n I felt that also and no more than he could explain it. But the reason, I know, stands in the forest behind the seedling. \n \n He walked his horse, and I strode beside. He asked my name and I gave it. Juan Lepe. We traveled Cordova road together. Presently he said, \"I leave Spain for France, and do you know why?\" \n \n Said Juan Lepe, \"I have been told something, and I have gathered something with my own eyes and ears. You would reach Asia by going west.\" \n \n He spoke in the measured tone of a recital often made alike to himself and to others. \"I hold that the voyage from Palos, say, first south to the Canaries and then due west would not exceed three months. Yet I began to go west to India full eighteen years ago! I have voyaged eighteen years, with dead calms and head winds, with storms and back-puttings, with pirates and mutinies, with food and water lacking, with only God and my purpose for friend! I have touched at the court of Portugal and at the court of Spain, and, roundabout way, at the court of England, and at the houses of the Doges of Venice and of Genoa. They all kept me swinging long at anchor, but they have never given me a furthering wind. Eighteen years going to India! But why do I say eighteen? The Lord put me forth from landside the day I was born. Before I was fourteen, at the school in Pavia, He said, \u0027Go to sea. Sail under thy cousin Colombo and learn through long years all the inches of salt water.\u0027 Later He said, one day when we were swinging off Alexandria, \u0027Study! Teach thyself! Buy books, not wine nor fine clothes nor favor of women. Study on land and study at sea. Look at every map that comes before you. Learn to make maps. When a world map comes before you, look at the western side of it and think how to fill it out knowingly. Listen to seamen\u0027s tales. Learn to view the invisible and to feel under foot the roundness of my earth!\u0027 \n \n \"And He said that same year off Aleppo, \u0027Learn to command ships. Learn in King Reinier\u0027s war and in what other war Genoa makes. Learn to direct men and patiently to hear them, winding in and out of their counsels, keeping thyself always wiser than they.\u0027 Well, I studied, and learned, and can command a ship or ships, and know navigation, and can make maps and charts with the best, and can rule seamen, loving them the while. Long ago, I went to that school which He set, and came forth magister! Long after His first speaking, I was at Porto Santo, well named, and there He said, \u0027Seek India, going westward.\u0027\" He turned his face to the sun. \"I have been going to India fifty-six years.\" \n \n Juan Lepe asked, \"Why, on yesterday, were you not content with the King and Queen\u0027s terms? They granted honor and competence. It was the estate of a prince that you asked.\" \n \n Some moments passed before he answered. The sun was shining, the road white and dusty, the mountains of Elvira purple to the tops and there splashed with silver. When he spoke, his voice was changed. Neither now nor hereafter did he discourse of money-gold and nobility flowing from earthly kings with that impersonal exaltation with which he talked of his errand from God to link together east and west. But he drew them somehow in train from the last, hiding here I thought, an earthly weakness from himself, and the weakness so intertwined with strength that it was hard to divide parasite from oak. \n \n \"Did you see,\" he asked, \"a boy with me? That was my son Diego whom I have left with a friend in Santa Fe. Fernando, his half-brother, is but a child. I shall see him in Cordova. I have two brothers, dear to me both of them, Diego and Bartholomew. My old father, Dominico Colombo, still lives in Genoa. He lives in poverty, as I have lived in poverty these many years. And there is Pedro Correo, to whom I owe much, husband of my wife\u0027s sister. My wife is dead. The mother of Fernando is not my wife, but I love her, and she is poor though beautiful and good. I would have her less poor; I would give her beautiful things. I have love for my kindred,—love and yearning and care and desire to do them good, alike those who trust me and those who think that I had failed them. I do not fail them!\" \n \n We padded on upon the dusty road. I felt his inner warmth, divined his life. But at last I said, \"What the Queen and King promise would give rich care—\" \n \n \"I have friends too, for all that I ride out of Spain and seem so poor and desolate! I would repay—ay, ten times over—their faith and their help.\" \n \n \"Still—\" \n \n \"There are moreover the poor, and those who study and need books and maps that they cannot purchase. There are convents—one convent especially—that befriended me when I was alone and nigh hopeless and furthered my cause. I would give that convent great gifts.\" Turning in the saddle he looked southwest. \"Fray Juan Perez—\" \n \n Palos shore spread about me, and rose La Rabida, white among vineyards and pines. Doves flew over cloister. But I did not say all I knew. \n \n \"There are other things that I would do. I do not speak of them to many! They would say that I was mad. But great things that in this age none else seems inclined to do!\" \n \n \"As what?\" I asked. \"I have been called mad myself. I am not apt to think you so.\" \n \n He began to speak of a mighty crusade to recover the Holy Sepulchre. \n \n The road to Cordova stretched sunny and dusty. Above the mountains of Elvira the sky stood keen blue. Juan Lepe said slowly, \"Admiral of the Ocean-Sea and Viceroy and Governor of continents and islands in perpetuity, sons and sons\u0027 sons after you, and gilded deep with a tenth of all the wealth that flows forever from Asia over Ocean-Sea to Spain, and you and all after you made nobles, grandees and wealthy from generation to generation! Kings almost of the west, and donors to the east, arousers of crusades and freers of the Sepulchre! You build a high tower!\" \n \n Carters and carts going by pushed us to the edge of road and covered all with dust. He waited until the cloud sank, then he said, \"Do you know—but you cannot know what it is to be sent from pillar to post and wait in antechambers where the air stifles, and doff cap—who have been captain of ships!—to chamberlain, page and lackey? To be called dreamer, adventurer, dicer! To hear the laugh and catch the sneer! To be the persuader, the beggar of good and bad, high and low—to beg year in and year out, cold and warmth, summer and winter, sunrise, noon and sunset, calm and storm, beg of galleon and beg of carrack, yea, beg of cockboat! To see your family go needy, to be doubted by wife and child and brethren and friends and acquaintance! To have them say, \u0027While you dream we go hungry!\u0027 and \u0027What good will it do us if there is India, while we famish in Spain?\u0027 and \u0027You love us not, or you would become a prosperous sea captain!\u0027—Not one year but eighteen, eighteen, since I saw in vision the sun set not behind water but behind vale and hill and mountain and cities rich beyond counting, and smelled the spice draught from the land!\" \n \n I saw that he must count upon huge indemnity. We all dream indemnity. But still I thought and think that there was here a weakness in him. Far inward he may have known it himself, the outer self was so busy finding grounds! After a moment he spoke again, \"Little things bring little reward. But to keep proportion and harmony, great thing must bring great things! You do not know what it is to cross where no man hath crossed and to find what no man hath found!\" \n \n \"Yes, it is a great thing!\" \n \n \"Then,\" said he, \"what is it, that which I ask, to the grandeur of time!\" \n \n He spoke with a lifted face, eyes upon the mountain crests and the blue they touched. They were nearer us than they had been; the Pass of Elvira was at hand. Yet on I walked, and before me still hung the far ocean west of Palos. I said, \"I know something of the guesses, the chances and the dangers, but I have not spent there years of study—\" \n \n He kindled, having an auditor whom he chose to think intelligent. He checked his horse, that fell to grazing the bit of green by the way. \"As though,\" he said, \"I stood in Cipango beneath a golden roof, I know that it can be done! Twelve hundred leagues at the most. Look!\" he said. \"You are not an ignoramus like some I have met; nor if I read you right are you like others who not knowing that True Religion is True Wonder up with hands and cry, \u0027Blasphemy, Sacrilege and Contradiction!\u0027 Earth and water make an orb. Place ant on apple and see that orbs may be gone around! Travel far enough and east and west change names! Straight through, beneath us, are other men.\" \n \n \"Feet against feet. Antipodes,\" I said. \"All the life of man is taking Wonder in and making Her at home!\" \n \n \"So!\" he answered. \"Now look! The largeness of our globe is at the equator. The great Ptolemy worked out our reckoning. Twenty-four hours, fifteen degrees to each, in all three hundred and sixty degrees. It is held that the Greeks and the Romans knew fifteen of these hours. They stretched their hand from Gibraltar and Tangier, calling them Pillars of Hercules, to mid-India. Now in our time we have the Canaries and the King of Portugal\u0027s new islands—another hour, mark you! Sixteen from twenty-four leaves eight hours empty. How much of that is water and how much is earth? Where ends Ocean-Sea and where begins India and Cathay, of which the ancients knew only a part? The Arabian Alfraganus thinks that Ptolemy\u0027s degrees should be less in size. If that be right, then the earth is smaller than is thought, and India nearer! I myself incline to hold with Alfraganus. It may be that less than two months\u0027 sailing, calm and wind, would bring us to Cipango. Give me the ships and I will do it!\" \n \n \"You might have had them yesterday.\" \n \n To a marked extent he could bring out and make visible his inner exaltation. Now, tall, strong, white-haired, he looked a figure of an older world. \"The spheres and all are set to harmony!\" he said. \"I would have fitness. Great things throughout! Diamonds and rubies without flaw in the crown.—We will talk no more about abating just demand!\" \n \n I agreed with a nod, and indeed there was never any shaking him here. Beneath his wide and lofty vision of a world filled out to the eternal benefit of all rested always this picture which I knew he savored like wine and warmth. His family, his sons, his brothers and kindred, the aged father in Genoa, all friends and backers—and he a warm sun in the midst of them, all their doubts of him dispelled, shining out upon them, making every field rich, repaying a thousand, thousandfold every trust shown him. \n \n The day sang cool and high and bright, the mountains of Elvira had light snow atop. Master Christopherus began again to speak. \n \n \"There came ashore at Porto Santo some years ago a piece of wood long as a spar but thicker. Pedro Correo, who is my brother-in-law, saw it. It was graved all over, cut by something duller than our knives with beasts and leaves and a figure that Pedro thought was meant for an idol. He and another saw it and agree in their description. They left it on the beach at twilight, well out of water reach. But in the night came up a great storm that swept it away. It came from the west, the wind having blown for days from that quarter. I ask you will empty billows fell a tree and trim it and carve it? It is said that a Portuguese pilot picked up one like it off Cape Bojador when the wind was southwest. I have heard a man of the Azores tell of giant reeds pitched upon his shore from the west. There is a story of the finding on the beach of Flores the bodies of two men not like any that we know either in color or in feature. For days a west wind had driven in the seas. And I know of other findings. Whence do these things come? \n \n \"May there not be unknown islands west of Azores? They might come from there, and still to the west of them stream all Ocean-Sea, violent and unknown! The learned think the earth of such a size. Your Arabian holds it smaller. What if it is larger than the largest calculation?\" \n \n He said with disdain, \"All the wise men at Salamanca before whom the King set me six years ago thought it had no end! Large or small, they called it blasphemy for me, a poor, plain seaman, son of a wool-comber and not even a Spanish wool-comber, to try to stretch mind over it! Ocean-Sea had never been overpassed, and by that token could not be overpassed! None had met its dangers, so dangers there must be of a most strange and fearful nature! But if you were put to sea at fourteen and have lived there long, water becomes water! A speck on the horizon will turn out ship or land. Wave carries you on to wave, day to night and night to day. At last there is port!\" \n \n All this time his horse had been cropping the scanty herbage. Now he raised his head. In a moment we too heard the horsemen and looking back toward Santa Fe saw four approaching. As they came nearer we made out two cavaliers talking together, followed by serving men. When they were almost at hand one of the leaders said something, whereat his fellow laughed. It floated up Cordova road, a wide, deep, rich laugh. Master Christopherus started. \"That is the laugh of Don Luis de St. Angel!\" \n \n Don Luis de St. Angel was, I knew, Receiver of the Ecclesiastical Revenues for Aragon, a man who stood well with the King. The horsemen were close upon us. Suddenly the laugher cried, \"Saint Jago! Here he is!\" \n \n We were now five mounted men and a trudger afoot. The cavalier who had laughed, a portly, genial person with a bold and merry eye, laughed again. \"Well met, Don Cristoval. Well met, Admiral! I looked to find you presently! You sailed out of port at sunrise and I two hours later with a swifter ship and more canvas—\" \n \n \"\u0027Don\u0027 and \u0027Admiral\u0027!\" answered Master Christopherus, and he spoke with anger. \"You jest in Spain! But in France it shall be said soberly—\" \n \n \"No, no! Don and Admiral here! Viceroy and Governor here—as soon as you find the lands! Wealthy here—as soon as you put hand on the gold!\" Don Luis de St. Angel\u0027s laughter ceased. He became with portentous swiftness a downright, plain man of business. He talked, all of us clustered together on the Cordova road. \n \n \"The Archbishop kept me from that audience yesterday, leaving Don Alonso de Quintanella your only friend there! The Queen was tired, the King fretted. They thought they had come a long way, and there you stood, Master Christopherus, shaking your head! Don Alonso told me about it, and how hopeless it seemed! But I said, \u0027If you conquer a land don\u0027t you put in a viceroy? I don\u0027t see that Don Cristoval isn\u0027t as good as Don This One, or Don That One! I\u0027ve a notion that the first might not oppress and flay the new subjects as might the last two! That is a point to be made to the Queen! As for perpetuity of office and privileges down the ages, most things get to be hereditary. If it grows to be a swollen serpent something in the future will fall across and cut it in two. Let time take care of it! As for wealth, in any land a man who will bear an eighth of the cost may fairly expect an eighth of the gain. This setting out is to cost little, after all. He says he can do it with three small ships and less than a hundred and fifty men. If the ships bring back no treasure, he will not be wealthy. If there is a little gain, the Spains need not grudge him his handful of doubloons. If there is huge gain, the King and Queen but for him would not have their seven eighths. The same reasoning applies to his tenth of all future gain from continents and islands. You will say that some one else will arise to do it for us on easier terms. Perhaps—and perhaps not for a century, and another Crown may thrust in to-morrow! France, probably. It is not impossible that England might do it. As for what is named overweening pride and presumption, at least it shows at once and for altogether. We are not left painfully to find it out. It goes with his character. Take it or leave it together with his patience, courage and long head. Leave it, and presently we may see France or England swallow him whole. He will find India and Cathay and Cipango, and France or England will be building ships, ships, ships! Blessed Virgin above us!\u0027 said I, \u0027If I could talk alone to the Sovereigns, I think I could clench it!\u0027\" \n \n \"\u0027Then let us go now to the palace,\u0027 says Don Alonso, \u0027and beg audience!\u0027 \n \n \"That did we, Don Cristoval, and so I hail you \u0027Don\u0027 and \u0027Admiral\u0027, and beg you to turn that mule and reenter Santa Fe! In a few days you and the King and Queen may sign capitulations.\" \n \n \"Was it the Queen?\" \n \n \"Just. The King said the treasury was drained. She answered, \u0027I will pawn my jewels but he shall sail!\u0027 Luis de St. Angel says, \u0027It does not need. There is some gold left in the coffers of Aragon. After all, the man asks but three little ships and a few score seamen and offers himself to furnish one of the ships.\u0027\" \n \n \"With Martin Alonso Pinzon\u0027s help, I will!\" \n \n \"\u0027Never,\u0027 said I to their majesties, \u0027was so huge a possible gain matched against so small a sending forth! And as for this Genoese who truly hath given and gives and will give his life for his vision, saith not Scripture that a laborer is worthy of his hire?\u0027 At which the Queen said with decision, \u0027We will do it, Don Luis! And now go and find Master Christopherus and comfort him, whose heart must be heavy, and indeed mine,\u0027 she saith, \u0027was heavy when he went forth to-day, and a voice seemed to say within me, \"What have you done, Isabella? How may you have hindered!\"\u0027\" \n \n The Gatherer of Ecclesiastical Revenues laughed again with that compelling laughter. \"So forth we go, and Don Alonso sends for you to his house. But you could not be found. Early this morning came one and informed us that the ship had put out of harbor, whereupon my nephew and I set sail after!\" \n \n The Admiral of the Ocean-Sea turned his face to the west. Not knowing, I think, what he did, he raised his arm, outstretched it, and the hand seemed to close in greeting. His face was the face of a man who sees the Beloved after long and sorrowful absence. So did thought and passion and vision charge his frame and his countenance, that for a moment truly there was effulgence. It startled. Don Luis held his speech suspended, in his eyes wonder. Master Christopherus let fall his arm. He sighed. The out-pushing light faltered, vanished. One might say, if one chose, \"A Genoese sea captain, willing to do an adventurous thing and make a purse thereby!\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1516/45186.html","bookId":1303,"book":{"id":1303,"title":"1492","description":"简介： THE morning was gray and I sat by the sea near Palos in a gray mood.
