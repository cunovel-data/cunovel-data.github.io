Would the old poet want his graduate workshop back?\\n\\n Valentine lunged forward, took Morgan\u0027s elbow into his bony fist, maneuvered Morgan into the smoke. The spindly professor\u0027s grip was iron.\\n\\n \"Now listen, old sport,\" Valentine said. \"I\u0027d really appreciate it if you could keep my presence here on the hush-hush side. Understand?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n They arrived at a low leather couch, and Valentine dropped Morgan at one end. Valentine perched down at the other. \"It\u0027s just that I am still officially on sabbatical.\" He sucked long on the bong. \"I need rest. I couldn\u0027t stomach a mob of ghastly students and their dreadful writing.\"\\n\\n \"I understand.\"\\n\\n \"Do you?\" Valentine leaned forward, squeaking the sofa leather. Shaggy brows knotted with stress. \"I can\u0027t write anymore, Bill. My head is cluttered with student writing. Insipid, clich¨¦, rhyming excrement.\"\\n\\n \"My name\u0027s not Bill.\"\\n\\n Valentine didn\u0027t hear. \"I sit down at my desk and nothing comes out. My pen is an impotent noodle.\"\\n\\n Morgan nodded, sunk into the vast, deep swallowing womb of the leather sofa. He\u0027d just been making the same complaints. His mind drifted. If he\u0027d had a chance to take a year off and write in Prague, he damn well would have made good use of it. He daydreamed himself to cobblestone streets. Perhaps the ganja smoke had gotten the better of him.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t tell anyone,\" he told Valentine.\\n\\n Valentine grinned, eyes brightening. He patted Morgan on the knee. \"That\u0027s a good fellow, Bill. I appreciate it. I really do. Let\u0027s smoke on it, eh? Seal the deal.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d prefer a beer,\" Morgan said, more a wish than an actual request.\\n\\n \"Certainly.\" Valentine waved his hand like he was casting a spell. \"In the refrigerator behind the desk.\"\\n\\n four\\n\\n Harold Jenks crouched on the fifth-floor fire escape of the abandoned building and smoked a Philly Blunt with one hand, the other hand in the warm front pocket of his Cardinals sweatshirt. He scanned the alley below. He puffed quick and nervous, watched the smoke spiral away on the cold wind.\\n\\n He was always nervous picking up a delivery from Red Zach. Anything could happen. Only two years ago, the cops had shot Jenks\u0027s cousin in a drop just like this. Those undercover fuckers could be anywhere-on the roof, in the old buildings, disguised as homeless drunks sleeping in a Dumpster. Anywhere.\\n\\n Sherman Ellis\u0027s wallet still hung heavy in Jenks\u0027s back pocket. Jenks sighed out a long, gray stream of smoke. He hadn\u0027t wanted Spoon to kill that boy. His heart hadn\u0027t been in it. Hadn\u0027t been in a lot of things for a while now. If Spoon hadn\u0027t been there...\\n\\n Jenks had told Spoon his wild idea, but in a flash of sanity, Jenks figured it just wouldn\u0027t work. Spoon told him he was crazy and should throw the wallet out. If he did this thing-if he was crazy enough-he\u0027d keep it under wraps. He would tell no one. Jenks would simply slip off quiet into the night. He made Spoon swear to keep it secret.\\n\\n A flutter of noise off to his right. Jenks jerked, his free hand going to the Glock at the small of his back. But it was only pigeons. Damn sky rats sawing on Jenks\u0027s nerves.\\n\\n He smoked the Blunt down to the end, flicked the glowing butt into the alley.\\n\\n Then he saw Red Zach\u0027s white limousine enter the alley. It approached slowly, parked under Jenks\u0027s fire escape. Five men got out. Four big motherfuckers, hands deep in the pockets of expensive overcoats, stone faces, sunglasses. They spread out and kept watch.\\n\\n Red Zach craned his neck, looked up at Jenks. Jenks waved. Red Zach climbed the fire escape. Jenks watched him come. Zach carried a small canvas gym bag.\\n\\n Red Zach had hair the color of a fire engine. Not natural, of course. Zach was a broad-shouldered, light-skinned black man with a pencil-thin beard also dyed red. He had sharp features, a pointed nose. Story around was Zach had some white blood in him somehow.\\n\\n Jenks heard Zach clanging halfway up. Red Zach wore an impressive collection of gold chains and bracelets, a brown pin-striped suit that cost more money than Jenks saw in a month.\\n\\n By the time Zach reached the fifth floor he was huffing and puffing pretty good.\\n\\n \"You know I\u0027d climb down,\" Jenks said.\\n\\n \"Better up here,\" Zach said. \"We can see if the cops come in either side of the alley and have plenty of time to dump the stuff. Besides\"-Zach grinned big, capped teeth, white-\"I need the exercise once in a while.\" He patted the beginnings of a slight paunch under his suit.\\n\\n Zach opened the gym back and showed Jenks the contents. It was full of little clear Baggies of white powder, prepackaged for street distribution. Jenks\u0027s job was to ferry the stuff to the bartenders and hairdressers and street pushers who distributed the stuff in his area. Jenks knew he was looking at a hundred thousand dollars\u0027 worth of junk.\\n\\n \"Here you go, Harold.\" Zach handed over the bag. \"You know what to do with it.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"You okay?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m good.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t seem like yourself,\" Zach said. \"You down? Got some kind of woman trouble?\" He nudged Jenks, laughed.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just tired.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. Where\u0027s your boy Spoon today?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t bring him.\"\\n\\n \"Shit, I know that. That\u0027s why I asked where he is.\"\\n\\n \"Went to see his sister and her kids. Going to eat Chinese with them.\"\\n\\n Zach leaned on the rail, looked down into the alley, then out across St. Louis. \"You know I been keeping an eye on you, Harold. You\u0027re doing good work, and I\u0027ve noticed that. I need loyal men on my team. You keep clearheaded and put in your time, and I\u0027ll do right by you. You know what I\u0027m saying?\"\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"I could send one of my boys up the ladder with the stuff if I wanted, but I come up here to talk to you personal. I\u0027m bringing you along. You hear what I\u0027m saying?\"\\n\\n \"I hear you.\" Jenks looked up at the gangster. \"You know I appreciate it, Red.\"\\n\\n Zach nodded, squeezed Jenks\u0027s shoulder. \"Okay. You stay cool and I\u0027ll check you later.\"\\n\\n Red Zach climbed back down the ladder. Jenks watched him get back into the limo with his boys. Jenks lit another Blunt, inhaled long and slow, watched the limo glide quiet out of the alley like smoke on the wind.\\n\\n Back at Jenks\u0027s shabby apartment, he threw the gym bag on the bed, looked at it for a long time.\\n\\n For two years he\u0027d been Red Zach\u0027s boy. He knew Red was right. If he stayed tight, he\u0027d eventually have a fine ride, a Caddy or a BMW. He\u0027d have fine clothes, bitches that did whatever he said simply because he was Red\u0027s boy.\\n\\n But Jenks kept seeing Ellis\u0027s eyes when Spoon had stabbed him. In one angry motion, Spoon had taken away everything the boy was, everything he\u0027d worked for. And Jenks was to blame too. He\u0027d been there.\\n\\n Jenks pulled his big army surplus duffel bag out from under the bed. He packed his clothes, packed everything he valued, and threw away the rest.\\n\\n And he took Red Zach\u0027s gym bag too.\\n\\n Red Zach sat in the back of his limo, mute goons on either side of him. The limo cruised the decay of East St. Louis\u0027s side streets. He had more stops to make. A big day of pimping and gangstering.\\n\\n He pulled out the latest copy of Esquire from between the seat cushions. There was a clothing advertisement which featured a square-jawed black man in denim. Stonewashed. Snakeskin boots. The jacket matched the jeans, and the black man had one leg up on some rocks, a mountain view in the background with an SUV off to the side. Zach couldn\u0027t decide if the man in denim looked rugged or like a fag.\\n\\n He thought about elbowing one of his goons, showing him the ad and asking what he thought. Never mind. It was no good talking to these guys. They didn\u0027t do talk. And Zach couldn\u0027t risk his image anyway. These boneheads expected him to strut around in ridiculous outfits and spit out homeboy talk. Fine. He\u0027d put on the act for the troops. Whatever.\\n\\n But Zach didn\u0027t bust his hump to clear a high six figures a year just to waste away in the hood. He had reservations in Aspen. He wanted to catch Don Giovanni before the season ended. He\u0027d recently become a gold-level member of the St. Louis Art Museum and there was a cocktail reception at the end of the month.\\n\\n He needed some new clothes.\\n\\n And some new acquaintances. He was surrounded by troops and his crew, but not pals. These leg-breaking motherfuckers were useful, but not good company.\\n\\n Harold Jenks was a little different. That boy had something. A quality. But Zach noticed something was off. Jenks had something on his mind. And when a brother didn\u0027t have his mind right, things could go bad.\\n\\n five\\n\\n Three beers later, and Morgan left Valentine\u0027s office, drifted back down to the inhabited floors of Albatross Hall. No sign of Ginny.\\n\\n Morgan felt woozy. Beer on an empty stomach, and he still wasn\u0027t in top shape from the night before. He needed to go home, get a bite to eat. He needed to shower again after the cloying experience of Valentine\u0027s smoke-filled office.\\n\\n On the way out of the building he heard Ginny\u0027s high, clear voice chasing after him. \"Professor Morgan!\"\\n\\n He ran to the parking lot, started his car, and almost smacked a coed while backing out of his space. In his rearview mirror, he saw Ginny fumble with car keys, gallop toward a half-rusted, silver Toyota. Morgan gunned the Buick, squealed the tires, and scraped pavement on his way out of the parking lot.\\n\\n He tangled himself in traffic on Garth Brooks Boulevard but thought he could still see her a dozen cars back. He yanked the Buick down a side street, found himself in a maze of student slums. He came out on Old Highway 12 and made the long, slow curve back to the house he rented. Morgan kept an eye in the rearview mirror, lips curving smug and satisfied when he didn\u0027t see Ginny\u0027s car.\\n\\n Not today, junior newshound.\\n\\n Morgan shuffled back into his little house. Not even 11 A.M. and he was beat, a little nauseous, skin slick with alcohol sweat. He\u0027d begun the semester recklessly, unprepared. He didn\u0027t even have syllabi finished for his two undergrad classes.\\n\\n Sleep. He\u0027d sleep away the rest of the day and start fresh tomorrow. And exercise. Sit-ups. He\u0027d start doing sit-ups. He was a wreck.\\n\\n \"You look like shit, Doc.\"\\n\\n Morgan leapt back against the door, yelped, a high-pitched bleat like a puppy or a little girl.\\n\\n \"Take it easy, Doc.\" It was Fred Jones. He perched like a ghost in the shadowy corner of Morgan\u0027s living room, a bony apparition in a billowy sweater, sitting in a wooden rocker but not rocking.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t just barge into a guy\u0027s house,\" Morgan said.\\n\\n \"Whittaker sprang the deal on you,\" said Jones. \"I understand that. You wasn\u0027t ready, so I figured I\u0027d come talk to you one-on-one.\"\\n\\n Morgan had almost forgotten. He\u0027d agreed to participate in something and wasn\u0027t sure what it was. Still, Whittaker might have wanted him to humor the old fart, but if he couldn\u0027t escape this shit in his own home, well, something would have to be done. First thing was to toss this old bag of sticks out on his ear. He started to tell the old man to take a hike when the giant walked in from the kitchen.\\n\\n \"Hey, boss, you want a beer? Imported.\" He was six and a half feet easy, shoulders carved of granite. His blue-stubbled chin was an anvil. Sleepy eyes. He chewed slowly, half a sandwich still in his fist. Morgan reconsidered his plan. Maybe he should politely ask what he could do for these fellows.\\n\\n Jones craned his neck, looked up at the bruiser. \"You know my doctor said to lay off, meathead.\"\\n\\n Assorted protests tumbled in Morgan\u0027s brain. The one that came out was \"That\u0027s my beer.\"\\n\\n \"Your cheese went bad,\" the giant said. He looked mournfully at the rest of the sandwich, then finished it in one bite.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t digest dairy,\" Jones said. He handed Morgan a manila folder filled with loose paper. Thick. \"How long to look at those?\"\\n\\n The folder was heavy. Morgan opened it. Poetry. Tons of it. Handwritten in feeble, shaky scrawl. \"What the hell am I supposed to do with this?\" He felt hungover-sick and confused. His stomach boiled. Head swimming.\\n\\n Those beers in my stomach. I need food. The thought of the bad cheese put him off. He rubbed the bridge of his nose.\\n\\n Jones leaned forward, frowned, put his gray hands on his knobby knees. \"Dammit, man, are you on the dope? You can\u0027t seem to focus on what we\u0027re doing here. I\u0027m getting impatient.\" He pulled a handkerchief out of his shirt pocket, shook it open, and blew his nose. \"By the way, you got a dead girl in your bedroom.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" Morgan felt hot in the face. His ears buzzed. He took halting steps toward his bedroom.\\n\\n \"Hey, Doc.\" It was the giant.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not a doctor. I have an MFA from Bowling Green.\" He was trying to think.\\n\\n \"I just wanted to tell you-\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tell me anything. Just shut up a second.\" He felt dizzy, blood pumping in his ears, mouth pasty. Did he just tell that hulk to shut up? What had happened to the girl? Annie. Was she...?\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter with you?\" asked the old man.\\n\\n Had Morgan done something to her? No, some kind of misunderstanding. But he couldn\u0027t feel his legs. Head... spinning...\\n\\n The giant said, \"I just thought you\u0027d want to know that there\u0027s this chubby girl looking in your front window.\"\\n\\n Morgan turned. Ginny Conrad had a hand cupped against the glass, trying to see into the dim living room.\\n\\n The room tilted. Morgan\u0027s mouth fell open, his jaw working but nothing coming out.\\n\\n Darkness.\\n\\n six\\n\\n Morgan blinked, moaned, belched acid. His eyes focused on the giant kneeling over him.\\n\\n \"You fainted.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t faint,\" Morgan said. \"I\u0027m not feeling well.\"\\n\\n \"You look like you\u0027re gonna barf.\"\\n\\n \"Look, Mr.- Who are you?\"\\n\\n \"Bob Smith.\"\\n\\n Morgan sat up. \"Where\u0027s Fred Jones? I want to know- Wait a fucking minute. Fred Jones and Bob Smith?\"\\n\\n \"The boss went to get help. He says we got to smooth over some of your problems for you.\"\\n\\n You are one of my problems.\\n\\n Morgan swallowed another belch, rubbed his head. \"The dead girl.\"\\n\\n \"And the live one.\" Bob jerked a thumb over his shoulder at the rocking chair in the corner.\\n\\n Ginny sat forward. \"Professor Morgan, will you please tell this enormous wad of muscles that I know you?\" Her chin was out, defiant. It was a good act. Morgan could hear the little tremor in her voice.\\n\\n \"For Christ\u0027s sake,\" Morgan said. \"She\u0027s a reporter for the university paper.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" Bob said. \"We searched her.\" He looked at her, eyes narrowed. \"She threw her shoes at me.\"\\n\\n \"They took my notepad and my tape recorder,\" Ginny said.\\n\\n Morgan climbed to his feet, swayed a little, then headed for the bedroom. \"Back in a minute.\"\\n\\n Ginny made a little disgusted noise. \"Professor, what\u0027s going on? This guy won\u0027t let me leave.\"\\n\\n \"Just shut up a minute, okay?\"\\n\\n He kept his eyes averted from the girl in his bed and went to the bathroom. He splashed water in his face, leaned on the sink.\\n\\n He went back out and looked at Annie. Eyes closed, lips slightly apart. She could have been sleeping. Somebody\u0027s child gently napping. Perhaps it had been a mistake. Maybe she was fine, and Morgan moved toward her as he thought this, hand outstretched to touch her cheek. If she was warm...\\n\\n But he jerked his hand back. If she was cold, he wouldn\u0027t be able to stand it. It would break him. He\u0027d lose it. Had she still been alive earlier or not? Had she been dead when they were under the covers together?\\n\\n He went back in the bathroom, closed the door, and sat on the toilet.\\n\\n What in holy hell was he going to do? After that business with the provost\u0027s daughter at UNLV two years ago, Morgan was lucky to be working at all. Another disgrace might relegate him to a community college in backwoods Mississippi for the rest of his career. He hadn\u0027t published a collection in seven years. He hadn\u0027t published a single poem in two. All he could do was teach. The thought of a nine-to-five job in some Dilbert office twisted his stomach again. A dead coed would seal his fate.\\n\\n A knock on the bathroom door startled Morgan. \"Yes?\"\\n\\n The old man pushed his way in, frowned down at Morgan like he was looking at a dumb little kid. He handed Morgan an empty pill bottle. \"Found this on her side of the bed. Looks like she couldn\u0027t handle her shit. You give this to her?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not.\"\\n\\n She\u0027d overdosed. Pills on top of the alcohol. Crazy. But the more Morgan thought about it, the more he wondered. He did feel pretty goddamn awful. Had she slipped him something? Last night was hazy at best, especially toward the end when they closed down the pool hall across from campus. Stix, it was called.\\n\\n Oh, hell, if somebody saw me with her...\\n\\n \"Come on,\" Jones said. \"I\u0027ve got some plastic. Let\u0027s get her out of here.\"\\n\\n Morgan followed him into the bedroom.\\n\\n Giant Bob turned Annie on her side, a big roll of clear plastic over his shoulder. It was an awkward arrangement. Annie\u0027s arms flopped.\\n\\n Ginny stood off to the side, eyes big, watching them wrap Annie in the plastic. \"Oh my God.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-pistol-poets/page-3.html","bookId":2247,"book":{"id":2247,"title":"The Pistol Poets","description":"Storyline: Mixing poetry with drugs, sex, and murder would not be the first thing to come to mind if you were thinking about writing crime fiction.
