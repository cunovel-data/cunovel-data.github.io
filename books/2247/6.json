{"id":85578,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"ten\n It was Abba this time that rolled through the empty corridors of Albatross Hall\u0027s fifth floor. The treble-sharp, crisp disco-pop of \"Super Trouper.\" Morgan followed the music to Valentine\u0027s office.\n He was wet and unhappy. His feet were bricks of ice.\n This late in the evening, he hadn\u0027t really expected the strange professor to be in his office. Morgan didn\u0027t exactly know what lured him up the stairs, up through the building\u0027s dead floors to seek the bizarre reclusive poet who haunted the vacant offices.\n He approached the door, prepared to knock, but stopped when he heard voices. Several voices. Cheerful and occasionally boisterous voices all simmering on the other side of Valentine\u0027s door.\n And the door opened.\n A nice-looking woman in a deep blue cocktail dress almost ran into him, stopped short, delicate hand going to the plunging V of her neckline. \"Oh. Sorry, didn\u0027t see you there.\" She was small, blond, handsome, makeup only slightly too heavy\n It occurred to Morgan to say, \"Uh...\"\n \"I\u0027m just looking for the little girls\u0027 room.\" She slipped past him. \"Go ahead on in.\" And she glided down the hall.\n Morgan stepped into the din.\n Valentine\u0027s office was crowded with people. A few looked young enough to be students. He recognized at least three professors from his own department. One bumped into him and spilled beer on his sleeve.\n It was Dirk Jakes.\n \"Morgan! Didn\u0027t expect to see you here, you old gypsy prof,\" Jakes said. \"Sorry about the spill there, chief.\" Jakes dabbed at Morgan\u0027s sleeve with the tip of his tie.\n Dirk Jakes was the loudest man Morgan had ever met. A blowhard, a self-promoter, and a merciless hack. He was squat, red-haired, red-nosed, and fit poorly into expensive dark suits. He puked out three pulpy crime novels a year and made Mickey Spillane look like William Faulkner. He taught fiction writing for the university.\n \"What is all this?\" Morgan asked.\n \"A party. You\u0027ve never seen a party before?\"\n \"Why here?\"\n \"Valentine\u0027s idea. All the stress builds up from the semester. Good to blow off steam.\"\n \"The semester\u0027s only a week old,\" Morgan said.\n \"You don\u0027t want the stress to build up,\" Jakes told him. \"Gets you all tight in the bunghole.\"\n \"I see.\"\n \"You\u0027re not a tight in the bunghole type of guy, are you?\" Jakes was clearly gearing up for a colossal drunk.\n \"I try not to be,\" Morgan said.\n \"That\u0027s swell, fabulous.\" Jakes nodded, pushed him on into the depths of the party. \"The bar\u0027s over there someplace. Go loosen up your goddamn bunghole, for Pete\u0027s sake.\"\n \"Good idea.\" Morgan moved into the mass of partygoers, glad for an excuse to get away from Jakes. The party writhed around him, seemed to breathe in and out like a living thing.\n He tried to spot Valentine but didn\u0027t see him.\n Somebody grabbed his arm, and Morgan turned.\n It was Dirk Jakes again.\n \"Listen, I forgot to tell you.\" Jakes wouldn\u0027t let go of his arm. \"Don\u0027t mention to anyone that Valentine\u0027s back. Make like he\u0027s still in Prague, you get it?\"\n \"I get it.\"\n \"Don\u0027t let the cat out of the bag, eh? The old man doesn\u0027t want the dean putting him on some goddamn bullshit committee or something, so he\u0027s lying low, capische?\"\n Morgan pried his arm loose. \"I won\u0027t say a thing.\"\n He made his way to the little fridge where he\u0027d found a bottle of beer his last visit, but it was empty. A curtain on the back wall was pushed aside, and he saw that the wall had been knocked through into the next office. He ducked through, found another crowd of people on the other side. They stood around a keg of beer, a stack of yellow plastic cups on a sideboard.\n Morgan took a cup, poured beer. Too foamy.\n \"You have to tilt the cup.\" The high-pitched voice belonged to a petite, raven-haired girl about twenty years old. \"You have to tilt it. I know because I tend bar down at Peckerwood\u0027s, the sports bar across town. You know it?\"\n Morgan shook his head. \"I\u0027m new in town.\"\n She took the cup out of Morgan\u0027s hand, dumped the foam, and tilted the cup. \"See, like this.\" She poured the beer, smooth.\n Morgan watched her pour. She was barely five feet tall, twig of a thing. Tight denim shorts, pink T-shirt a size too small. Flip-flops, toenails painted lime. She must\u0027ve had boots around somewhere. He thought of his own freezing feet.\n \"You\u0027re a student here?\" Morgan asked.\n She shook her head, handed Morgan his cup. \"I walk Professor Valentine\u0027s dogs.\"\n \"He has dogs?\"\n \"Two Irish wolfhounds. Huge, but very gentle. I keep them for him ever since the problem with his house.\"\n \"I was looking for Valentine,\" Morgan said.\n \"I haven\u0027t seen him in a while.\" The girl\u0027s attention immediately whipped to a newcomer at the keg. \"You have to tilt it or you\u0027ll get foam,\" she said.\n Morgan drank half his beer and drifted back through the hole in the wall, where he found a couple of familiar faces, two more professors from his department.\n They seemed to be in the middle of an argument, both very drunk.\n \"It\u0027s a ridiculous book and you know it, Pritcher. You Irish folk have been skating on Joyce for too long. Finnegans Wake is bullshit. Everyone knows it\u0027s bullshit. Joyce knew it was bullshit when he wrote it. Now get out of my face please, you ridiculous little tit.\"\n Professor Louis Reams was a lanky, storklike man. Morgan had spoken casually with him a few times and seemed to remember he\u0027d done his dissertation on the complex prosody of Sri Lankan poetry in translation. Morgan suspected Reams had an inferiority complex from having to explain all the time just exactly what his specialty was.\n He towered over the much shorter Pritcher, jabbing a finger at his face as he spoke.\n Professor Larry Pritcher looked uninterested, dismissed the ranting Reams with a wave of his small, pale hand. Early in grad school, Pritcher had hitched himself to the James Joyce bandwagon and never looked back. He fully enjoyed the massive safety of James Joyce studies and relentlessly needled \"fringe\" scholarship as new wave, multicultural carnival acts.\n \"Put a cork in it, Reams,\" Pritcher said. \"You\u0027re drunk.\"\n \"You have no concept of what it\u0027s like to follow an original thread of thought.\"\n \"This again.\"\n \"Fuck you with bells on.\" Reams gave him the up yours gesture.\n Pritcher turned to Morgan. \"Can you believe this guy? I\u0027m just trying to have a goddamn drink.\"\n Morgan blinked. He hadn\u0027t expected to be drawn into it. \"Well...\"\n \"Exactly,\" Pritcher said. \"Nobody wants you here, Reams. You\u0027re bringing the party down.\"\n Morgan noticed that the bulk of the party appeared to be pressing on unhindered.\n \"The hell you say?\" Reams scowled. \"That true, Morgan? I\u0027m somehow some kind of party pooper?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think anyone wants to have an argument,\" Morgan said.\n \"So you do think I\u0027m a party pooper.\"\n \"I never said-\"\n \"Fine.\" Reams finished his beer in one angry gulp, threw the empty cup on the floor. \"Screw you too, Morgan. Easy for you to judge. You\u0027re just passing through. I have to work here for Christ\u0027s sake.\"\n Reams jostled his way through the crowd for the door, partygoers frowning after him.\n \"What a prick,\" Pritcher said.\n \"I think he took me wrong,\" Morgan said.\n \"He takes everything wrong. He\u0027s just wrongheaded altogether.\"\n \"Have you seen Valentine?\" Morgan gulped beer, liked it, gulped some more.\n \"Not for a while.\" Pritcher cleared his throat, leaned in close to Morgan, spoke low in conspiracy tones. \"Look, don\u0027t mention to anyone about Valentine\u0027s being back. He doesn\u0027t want-\"\n \"I know,\" Morgan said. \"Mum\u0027s the word.\"\n Dirk Jakes surged out of the party crowd, landed on swaying legs in front of Pritcher and Morgan. \"All the goddamn broads at this party must be dykes.\"\n \"Do tell,\" Pritcher said.\n \"Buncha damn lesbos,\" Jakes slurred. \"You catch what I\u0027m saying there, Morgo-man?\" Jakes brayed laughter, yanked Morgan\u0027s sleeve.\n Beer splashed over Morgan\u0027s cup. \"Dammit. Again?\"\n \"Jesus, sorry, Morgan.\" Jakes threw himself in reverse, stumbled back to have a look where he\u0027d spilled the beer. \"What the hell? Are those slippers?\"\n \"Forget it,\" Morgan said. \"You were telling us about the lesbians.\"\n \"Yeah. Every bitch here a damn rug-muncher.\"\n \"Striking out again, eh?\" Pritcher\u0027s lips curled into a smug grin.\n Morgan thought about the woman in the blue cocktail dress, the one who\u0027d almost plowed into him on the way into the party. He craned his neck, scanned the party for her. Nowhere. Too bad.\n \"That bimbo at the keg was the worst.\" Jakes was still at it. \"I know how to pour a fucking beer.\"\n The party music segued into \"Folsom Prison\" by Johnny Cash.\n Pritcher wrinkled up his whole face like somebody had taken a dump in his cup. \"Country music? You must be joking. Who\u0027d put that on?\"\n Jakes looked stunned. \"Are you fucking kidding?\"\n \"What would I kid about?\" Pritcher asked.\n Morgan wiggled his toes within the damp slippers. They were just getting dry when Jakes had splashed the beer on them. His feet were cold and wet and he was sick of Pritcher and especially Jakes.\n \"It\u0027s Johnny Cash, man.\" Jakes waved his cup in the air like that explained it. \"Johnny fucking Cash.\"\n \"So?\"\n Jakes snorted. \"You\u0027re an idiot.\"\n \"Okay, just forget it,\" Pritcher said. \"I\u0027ve had enough of these drunks, Morgan. I\u0027ve got to get up early anyway.\"\n \"On a Saturday?\" Morgan asked.\n \"I ride my bicycle in the mornings. Good night.\"\n Morgan waved as he left.\n \"What a dink,\" Jakes said. \"Can you imagine not liking Johnny Cash?\"\n Morgan didn\u0027t say anything.\n \"I\u0027m going to find some pussy,\" Jakes said. \"There must be some scratch at this party that isn\u0027t lesbo.\" And he was off to it again.\n Morgan looked in his cup. He saw no beer and that made him unhappy. He threaded his way back to the keg.\n The sports bar girl had moved on. Morgan elbowed a fat guy out of the way and refilled his cup. He wasn\u0027t sure when he might be able to make it around to the keg again, so he threw back the beer fast and filled up again. He took his fresh beer back into the crowd.\n The noise and the beer and the party were crowding out thoughts Morgan didn\u0027t want to think. He was starting to feel good, a nice glow in his belly. He even forgot about his wet slippers.\n A tap on his shoulder.\n He turned and looked down into the soft eyes of the woman in the blue V-neck dress. She looked good.\n \"You\u0027re Morgan?\" she shouted over the music.\n He smiled, nodded.\n \"This way.\" She grabbed his elbow, pulled him along.\n Morgan followed gladly.\n She led him from the party, down the hall. She turned, walked, turned again, walked more, turned a few more times. The building didn\u0027t seem big enough for this. Surely they were going in circles. Morgan couldn\u0027t keep track, but he wasn\u0027t trying too hard.\n And he didn\u0027t wonder too hard where he was going. It was good not to make such hard decisions for a change. He allowed himself a brief fantasy, like in Penthouse Forum. She\u0027d take him to a secluded room, where she\u0027d lift her skirt, tug aside her panties, and offer herself to him.\n That didn\u0027t happen.\n She pushed open a door and led him into a smoky room lit by candles. A man he didn\u0027t know sat deep in a cushy armchair. Valentine sat at the far end of a long, low sofa.\n \"Ah, good. It\u0027s Professor Morgan.\" Valentine puffed savagely on his bong. \"Brad, this is Bill Morgan. Bill, Brad Eubanks. He\u0027s the custodian here.\"\n \"It\u0027s Jay, actually.\" Morgan shook the man\u0027s hand.\n \"How do,\" Brad said.\n \"I\u0027m afraid I never got your name,\" Morgan said to the woman.\n \"Annette Grayson.\" She offered a slim hand.\n Morgan shook. It was soft and cool. He let go reluctantly.\n \"We teach in the same department,\" she said. \"I manage the Writing Lab and oversee Freshman Composition. I\u0027m surprised we haven\u0027t run into each other before now.\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry it\u0027s been so long.\"\n She pointed at Morgan\u0027s beer cup. \"You don\u0027t actually want that, do you?\"\n \"Don\u0027t I?\"\n \"Let me fix you something for a grown-up.\"\n She produced a bottle of vodka from thin air. Where had that been, between the couch cushions? Tonic next and a lime. Morgan was still reeling from the sleight of hand, when Annette pushed the vodka tonic at him. He took it, drank. Made the whole thing disappear presto chango.\n Valentine was on about something, but Morgan only considered the bottom of his empty cup.\n \"A refill?\" Annette was already pouring.\n She reads minds too. Good woman.\n Valentine went on about the state of poetry and academia, all the time puffing at his bong like some kind of homemade life-support system. Morgan\u0027s cup never seemed to get empty. His face warmed, and he floated through the hazy conversation with eyelids heavy, head bobbing in eager drunken agreement with the random conversation.\n The night didn\u0027t really end. It trailed off like an ellipsis. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-pistol-poets/page-6.html","bookId":2247,"book":{"id":2247,"title":"The Pistol Poets","description":"Storyline: \n Mixing poetry with drugs, sex, and murder would not be the first thing to come to mind if you were thinking about writing crime fiction.
