{"id":85583,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Jenks wasn\u0027t listening. He pulled the.32 revolver and the 9mm Glock from two of his baggy pockets. \"Here.\" He dropped the revolver into Lancaster\u0027s lap.\\n\\n \"What!\" Lancaster jerked, looked down at the gun like Jenks had dumped hot coals on his crotch. \"I don\u0027t want this thing.\"\\n\\n \"Shit.\" Jenks slammed a clip into the Glock. \"What the fuck you think you\u0027re here for? To keep me company?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want it.\" Lancaster looked sick. \"You said all I had to do was sit in the car. Give it to Wayne.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t bother.\" DelPrego reached under his seat, pulled out a double-barreled shotgun. \"Twelve-gauge. Loaded with buckshot.\" The barrels had been hacked short. The whole gun was barely two feet long, stock and all.\\n\\n Lancaster groaned.\\n\\n \"Good.\" Jenks stuck the Glock in his belt under the army jacket. \"You guys hang back. That\u0027s all. If he sees I got backup, he\u0027ll be less likely to pull a funny. Now drive up within a hundred feet of that barn. Nice and slow.\"\\n\\n They finished their coffee, tossed the cups out the window.\\n\\n Moses Duncan puffed a cigarette, watched through the crack in the barn door as the truck approached. He wore a heavy corduroy jacket which hid the.38 revolver in his belt. The pistol was thirty years old and had been his daddy\u0027s. He\u0027d kept it clean and well oiled over the years, just like Daddy had shown him.\\n\\n The truck was getting closer, and he could see three men in the front seat. That damn coon had brought friends. Hell, he should have figured. Well, that was okay. He had friends too. Big John up in the loft with a shotgun. His pal Eddie in the house, watching from the front window. Eddie was the most goddamn bad shot Moses had ever seen, but he could make a hell of a lot of noise with his army-issue.45.\\n\\n The coon had approached him yesterday about buying a buttload of coke at a fraction of the street value, and Moses thought, hell, why not get it for free? The guy was clearly from out of town. Nobody would miss him, and he could feed his body to the pigs. And the coke would be all his. He wouldn\u0027t have to filter the profits back to his contacts down in Oklahoma City. He could get a new Harley. Fix the thermostat in the house. Fix himself up with some new threads. Twenty grand for a hundred thousand dollars\u0027 worth of coke was actually a damn fine deal, but Duncan couldn\u0027t raise twenty grand any more than he could hammer a tent peg through a block of ice with his pecker.\\n\\n No, there just wasn\u0027t any honest way to do this deal, and frankly Duncan didn\u0027t bet on losing any sleep over it.\\n\\n Nothing to do now but let the truck get close and park. If he could get the coon into the barn, they could bushwhack him good.\\n\\n \"Stop the truck,\" Jenks said.\\n\\n DelPrego parked the truck a hundred feet from the barn and shifted into park. He left the engine running.\\n\\n \"Here\u0027s how it\u0027s going to happen,\" Jenks said. \"You guys get out the truck, see. Stand there by the open doors and watch me go toward the guy with the money. Be looking around in case he\u0027s got some buddies. Lancaster, you can leave that.32 in your coat pocket. It\u0027s small enough. Keep your hand in there like you\u0027re staying warm. Keep hold of the gun, be ready to bring it out fast in case some shit happens. You hear?\"\\n\\n Lancaster shook his head. \"I changed my mind.\" He looked a little green, breath short. \"Wayne? You changed your mind too, right? I want to go.\"\\n\\n Jenks ignored Lancaster, nudged DelPrego. \"You\u0027ll need to leave that scattergun on the seat, but the door will be open so you can grab it quick if you have to.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"But your main job is to drive. Some kind of hell breaks loose, you come get me. I\u0027ll jump in the bed so you can drive off quick. Slow down a little, so I can jump in the back.\"\\n\\n \"You expect trouble.\"\\n\\n \"Just being careful. Lancaster, you got to spray bullets at whoever\u0027s causing the trouble. Keep me covered until I\u0027m in the truck.\"\\n\\n \"God. Sherman, look, I don\u0027t want to shoot anybody, okay? I don\u0027t think I can. You said all I had to do was sit in the car.\"\\n\\n \"Sit in the car with the gun. You just got to make them duck. Give me a chance to get back.\"\\n\\n \"I have to pee.\"\\n\\n \"Chances are he\u0027ll give me the money and I\u0027ll give him the powder and that\u0027s that. So you two stay cool. Don\u0027t twitch out on me. Keep your eyes open.\"\\n\\n DelPrego opened their car door, stepped out. Lancaster was frozen in his seat. Jenks slid out DelPrego\u0027s side, walked around, and stood in front of the pickup. DelPrego leaned on the driver\u0027s-side door, the butt of the shotgun on the seat within quick reach.\\n\\n The barn door creaked open and Moses Duncan stepped out. He had a paper grocery sack under his arm. Jenks tried to eye him for weapons, but that corduroy jacket was so baggy, could have been twenty guns and a bazooka under there. Jenks waved, set the gym bag with the cocaine on the hood of DelPrego\u0027s truck.\\n\\n \"Hey there, boy,\" called Duncan. \"You\u0027re on time. Good. I got your money right here.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s trade,\" Jenks said.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s fine. Come on in the barn and we\u0027ll settle up.\"\\n\\n Jenks shook his head. \"Out here in the open.\"\\n\\n \"Hell, boy, I just want to get out of the wind.\" Duncan frowned, rubbed his nose with his thumb. \"Besides, I don\u0027t know them two fellows you brought. Sort of makes a man nervous.\"\\n\\n \"Look, dude, this is simple,\" Jenks said. \"You walk this way and I\u0027ll walk to you and we\u0027ll trade in the middle.\"\\n\\n Duncan looked back into the barn, turned again to Jenks. \"Yeah, okay.\"\\n\\n They both started walking and met between DelPrego\u0027s pickup and the barn. Jenks dropped the bag at Duncan\u0027s feet.\\n\\n Duncan smiled big. He was missing a molar toward the back. \"Got your cash right here. Had to hit up a few folks to raise this kind of money, but I managed to scrape it together.\" Duncan unrolled the top of the grocery sack, started to reach inside.\\n\\n \"Just hand me the bag.\" Jenks grabbed it, started to pull it out of Duncan\u0027s hands.\\n\\n For a split second Duncan resisted, his smile wavering. \"No problem. Count it if you want.\" He released his grip and Jenks took the sack.\\n\\n It had happened before that some slick criminal had hidden a gun in the money bag, gone in for greenbacks and came out with the heat. Jenks wasn\u0027t taking any chances. He opened the bag, peeked inside.\\n\\n DelPrego\u0027s voice came strained and panicked from behind. \"Sherman, look out!\"\\n\\n Duncan\u0027s hand was halfway out from under his jacket. Jenks saw the pistol and leapt forward, tossed the bag of money into Duncan\u0027s face, and grabbed at the gun. Duncan kicked him away, pulled the pistol, but Jenks was already swinging. He popped Duncan solid on the nose, pressed it flat. Duncan grunted and his pistol flew, landed behind him.\\n\\n Jenks went for his Glock, and behind him DelPrego\u0027s shotgun thundered.\\n\\n Jenks looked up.\\n\\n A lanky redneck in a blue plaid shirt fell through the open door of the barn\u0027s loft. He tumbled in B-movie slow motion, ragged arms flapping in the air. He did a long slow flip and landed on his back in the dirt.\\n\\n Explosions from the front window of the house. Shots.\\n\\n Bullets chewed up the ground around Jenks\u0027s feet, flew over his head, dotted the hood of DelPrego\u0027s truck with metallic ptunks. Jenks fled toward the pickup.\\n\\n DelPrego was in the driver\u0027s seat and already screaming toward him.\\n\\n Lancaster dropped the.32 onto the floor of the pickup. He squeezed himself as low and as small as possible. DelPrego slammed on the brakes too late, smacked Jenks in the upper thighs with the front bumper.\\n\\n Jenks sprawled back, landed hard in the dust. \"Fuck!\"\\n\\n Shots from the barn now. Duncan had recovered his pistol and was blasting wildly from the barn door. Most of the shots went high, but one shattered a headlight.\\n\\n Jenks fired from his back, upside down over his head back at Duncan, didn\u0027t hit anything but sky. Jenks shifted, shot at the house, shattered the glass of the front window into glittering shards.\\n\\n DelPrego stuck the sawed-off shotgun out the window, fired it one-handed. The buckshot pellets scorched the barn door, but a few ventilated Duncan\u0027s jacket under his left arm. Duncan\u0027s scream was high-pitched, like a frightened animal\u0027s. He ducked back into the barn, pushed the door closed.\\n\\n Jenks groaned to his feet, hobbled around to the side of the pickup, and threw himself in the bed. He still had the gym bag in a tight grip. \"Drive! Get the fuck out of here, man.\"\\n\\n DelPrego drove twenty feet then slammed on the brakes again.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\" Lancaster\u0027s eyes were as big as dinner plates. Shots had erupted again from the house\u0027s front window. \"Keep driving.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going for the money,\" DelPrego shouted. \"Cover me.\"\\n\\n DelPrego dashed from the truck, snatched the paper sack out of the dirt.\\n\\n \"Cover you? What?\" Lancaster yelled after him.\\n\\n Jenks raised his head from the back of the pickup, saw what DelPrego was doing. \"Run, white boy. Move your ass.\" He pointed the Glock at the house, unloaded the rest of his clip, the pistol bucking in his hand. More glass rained.\\n\\n DelPrego jumped back in the truck, tossed the sack into Lancaster\u0027s lap.\\n\\n He slapped the truck in gear and fishtailed around, stomped the gas. He clipped Duncan\u0027s mailbox as he made the turn out of the driveway. The mailbox made a hollow pop and spun off into the hedges. He hauled ass down the narrow dirt road, the plume of dust behind him like some kind of freak sandstorm. Each bump and dip almost tossed Jenks out of the back. He only slowed down when they finally reached the highway.\\n\\n DelPrego pointed the truck back toward town, chest heaving. Lancaster still shook.\\n\\n In the bed, Jenks lay flat on his back, looked up unblinking at the cloudless blue sky stretching wide and forever. After a few minutes he climbed to one knee and knocked on the little window in back of the cab.\\n\\n Lancaster slid it open.\\n\\n \"Check the money,\" Jenks said.\\n\\n Lancaster opened the bag, pulled out a wad of newspaper cut to seem like bills. He dumped the whole bag onto the floor of the pickup at his feet. It was all newspaper.\\n\\n \"Oh, no,\" Lancaster said. \"We were almost killed. Almost shot for shredded newspaper. I can\u0027t believe I let you two talk me into this.\"\\n\\n Jenks wasn\u0027t listening. He was already trying to figure what his next move would be.\\n\\n \"Cheer up.\" DelPrego grinned big at Lancaster. \"If it makes you feel any better, you can have my share.\"\\n\\n Moses Duncan unbuttoned his jacket with trembling hands. His ribs blazed. He felt warm and wet under his shirt. He peeled the jacket off, explored his side with tentative fingers. It stung. He wiped the blood away, made himself look.\\n\\n One of the shotgun pellets had only scraped him, a deep gash, plenty of blood.\\n\\n Nervous laughter spilled out of him. He thought the shotgun had ended him, the hot stab of pain when the guy in the truck had squeezed one off. He ripped off his T-shirt, bunched it against the wound.\\n\\n He looked outside, saw Big John flat on his back.\\n\\n \"Hell.\"\\n\\n He took two halting steps toward the house, saw the shattered glass of the front window. He tried to shout \"Eddie\" but it came out hoarse and choked. He was shivering now, breath coming in short, aching gasps. He gathered his voice. \"Eddie!\"\\n\\n Nothing.\\n\\n twenty\\n\\n Deke Stubbs sat across from the bored police sergeant, trying not to look as impatient as he felt. The sergeant was on the phone and didn\u0027t seem in any kind of hurry to get back to the P.I.\\n\\n Stubbs craned his neck, looked around the station. It was a pretty rinky-dink, tinstar operation. They probably handled minor crime, drunk college kids, traffic tickets, the usual. The sergeant wore his khaki shirt with the top two buttons open. A big straw hat pushed back on his head, and a police revolver slung low on his hip like a gunfighter\u0027s. He probably had a lasso in his pickup.\\n\\n Stubbs didn\u0027t think he was going to get much from the local law, but he thought he might as well work the case by the numbers. The Walshes had called the cops when they hadn\u0027t heard from their daughter in four days. According to Eileen Walsh the cops were \"impotent yahoos.\" Probably true. In any case, he was obligated to stop in and see if there\u0027d been any developments.\\n\\n The sergeant hung up the phone. His eyes focused on Stubbs again, and he frowned. \"Oh, yeah. Now what can we do you for, Mr. Stunk?\" His voice had a deep twang.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Stubbs.\" He stuck a cigarette between his lips. \"I told you already, Sarge. I\u0027m following up on a missing college kid. Annie Walsh. Her parents called you and made a report.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t light that. No smoking in county buildings.\"\\n\\n Stubbs stuck the cigarette behind his ear. He looked at the cop\u0027s name tag. \"Listen, Sergeant Hightower, maybe this is a bother for you, but the parents are really worried. How about you just check the files?\"\\n\\n Hightower nodded, smacked his teeth, and ran a thumb over the stubble on his chin. \"Well, let me tell you something, Stubbs. Better yet, let me show you something.\" He stood slowly, shuffled to a file cabinet behind his desk. He opened the top drawer, pulled out a thick file, and put it in front of Stubbs as he sat down again.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s just this last eighteen months or so,\" Hightower said. \"All parents who\u0027ve called about missing kids. Nearly four hundred on file. Half these parents phone all panicked if the kids miss responding to one e-mail. And the kids, hell, they get a taste of freedom and that\u0027s all she wrote. You think they always tell their folks when they run off with a boyfriend or a girlfriend or join some cult or even just load up a van full of beer with some fraternity buddies and head to Mexico? Shit no. Most of them turn up a week or a month later and can\u0027t believe anybody was looking for them. And one more thing. Once the little spoiled brats leave the county, it ain\u0027t our problem no more. We\u0027ll forward the report to the State Police if someone requests it, but it almost never gets that far.\"\\n\\n \"What about the ones dead or kidnapped?\"\\n\\n Hightower sighed. \"It happens, but not often and not recently.\"\\n\\n \"Annie Walsh has been missing two weeks.\"\\n\\n \"Hell, she could be in Colorado skiing.\"\\n\\n \"Or she could be dead.\"\\n\\n \"True enough,\" Hightower said. \"But until we get a body or some other kind of evidence it just ain\u0027t a priority.\"\\n\\n Stubbs grinned and stood. \"Thanks, Sarge. It\u0027s cops like you that keep guys like me in business.\"\\n\\n Hightower frowned, watched the private investigator shake his head as he left the police station.\\n\\n Stubbs drove in ever-widening circles around the little college town. He wasn\u0027t sight-seeing or getting the lay of the land although maybe that was a good idea. He simply thought better while driving. He hung one arm out the open window of the Dodge, let the cold blast him sharp in the face. It felt good.\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t thinking about how to go about his investigation. That was no problem. He just needed to find a thread, some kind of trail, then he\u0027d keep following it until it led to Annie Walsh. Someone had seen or talked to the girl. Stubbs just needed to find out who.\\n\\n How far could he string the Walshes along? Stubbs got paid by the day, and this wouldn\u0027t be the first time he took a more or less straightforward case and stretched it out like he was searching for the Lindbergh baby. He figured he could feed the Walshes little tidbits of information every two or three days, who he\u0027d interviewed, where he\u0027d been. From their end it would look like he was doing a lot of work.\\n\\n Okay, so what was the first stop? He checked his notepad, read the address for Annie\u0027s apartment. Maybe the roommate would be home. A good place to start.\\n\\n The girl was a stick figure, sickly pale, glasses thick. Lips fat and dark red. She looked at Stubbs through the door crack and over the chain. \"Yeah?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Deke Stubbs. Sorry to bother you. I\u0027m a private investigator. Annie\u0027s parents hired me to look for her. Can we talk?\"\\n\\n She unchained the door and opened it a bit wider, leaned against the door frame, looking up at Stubbs without any particular expectations.\\n\\n Stubbs checked his notepad. \"You\u0027re Tiffany?\"\\n\\n \"Just Tiff.\"\\n\\n \"Sure. You mind if I come in?\"\\n\\n She thought about it a little too long, but then stepped aside. Stubbs walked in, looked the place over. Secondhand furniture, a futon couch, prints of classic paintings cheaply framed. The living room turned into the dining room with a small kitchen on the side.\\n\\n \"When was the last time you saw Annie?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve already been through this with Annie\u0027s mom,\" she said. \"All I know is she\u0027s not here and rent\u0027s due in a week.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, that\u0027s a drag, but it would help. Really.\"\\n\\n \"It was right after the start of school, about two weeks ago. Maybe a bit more, but I didn\u0027t think much about it when I didn\u0027t see her for a while.\"\\n\\n \"Why\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t say this to Annie\u0027s mom, but in my opinion the girl was pretty much a slut. I\u0027m sorry if that\u0027s offensive.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not offended.\"\\n\\n \"When a girl has a different boyfriend one right after another, she\u0027s a slut. So I hardly ever saw her sometimes. She\u0027d stop in to check mail or change clothes or whatever, but she\u0027d sleep out a lot of nights.\"\\n\\n \"Do you have names for any of these guys?\"\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t any of my business, and I didn\u0027t care and I didn\u0027t want to know. Sometimes older men would come pick her up. You know what I mean by older.\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t sound like you liked her.\"\\n\\n \"She was just a roommate.\"\\n\\n \"Can I look in her room?\"\\n\\n Tiff shrugged. \"It\u0027s through there.\"\\n\\n She led him past a bathroom down a short hall, opened a door. A tiny bedroom. Clothes piled on the bed and behind the door. No pictures on the wall. Spartan.\\n\\n Stubbs opened dresser drawers, pushed the clothes around. Nothing.\\n\\n \"What are you looking for?\" Tiff acted like somebody who didn\u0027t want to seem interested but was.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" Stubbs looked under the bed. \"Anything helpful.\"\\n\\n \"She didn\u0027t have a lot of stuff,\" Tiff said. \"All the furniture is mine.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-pistol-poets/page-11.html","bookId":2247,"book":{"id":2247,"title":"The Pistol Poets","description":"Storyline: Mixing poetry with drugs, sex, and murder would not be the first thing to come to mind if you were thinking about writing crime fiction.
