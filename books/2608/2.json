You risked exposure so as you can be polite?\" The smile broadened. \"I am a creature of my time.\" \"You\u0027re a creature of the night! You know what\u0027ll come of this? Questions, that\u0027s what. And we don\u0027t need questions!\" \"I have complete faith in your ability to handle whatever might arise.\" Recognizing the tone, the little man deflated. \"Aye and well you might,\" he muttered darkly. \"Let\u0027s get that jacket off you before I\u0027ve got to carry you in to your bed like a sack of meal.\" \"I can do it myself,\" Henry remarked as he stood and turned to have his coat carefully peeled from his shoulders. \"Oh, aye, and leave it lying on the floor no doubt.\" Folding the coat in half, Varney draped it over one skinny arm. \"I\u0027d never get the wrinkles out. You\u0027d go about looking like you dressed out of a ragbag if it wasn\u0027t for me. Have you eaten?\" He looked suddenly hopeful. One hand on the bedchamber door, Henry paused. \"Yes,\" he said softly. The thin shoulders sagged. \"Then what\u0027re you standing about for?\" A few moments later, the door bolted, the heavy shutter over the narrow window secured, Henry Fitzroy, vampire, bastard son of Henry the VIII, once Duke of Richmond and Somerset, Earl of Nottingham, and Lord President of the Council of the North, slid into the day\u0027s oblivion. \"My apologies, Mrs. Evans, for not coming by sooner, but I was out when your husband\u0027s message arrived.\" Henry laid his hat and gloves on the small table in the hall and allowed the waiting footman to take his coat. \"I trust he\u0027s in better health than he was when I saw him last night?\" \"A great deal better, thank you.\" Although there were purple shadows under her eyes and her cheeks were more than fashionably pale, Lenore Evans\u0027 smile lit up her face. \"The doctor says he lost a lot of blood but he\u0027ll recover. If it hadn\u0027t been for you...\" As her voice trailed off, Henry bowed slightly. \"I was happy to help.\" Perhaps he had taken a dangerous chance. Perhaps he should have wiped all memory of his presence from the Captain\u0027s mind and left him on his own doorstep like an oversized infant. Having become involved, he couldn\u0027t very well ignore the message an obviously disapproving Varney had handed him at sunset with a muttered, I told you so. It appeared that there were indeed going to be questions. Following Mrs. Evans up the stairs, he allowed himself to be ushered into a well-appointed bedchamber and left alone with the man in the bed. Propped up against his pillows, recently shaved but looking wan and tired, Charles Evans nodded a greeting. \"Fitzroy. I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve come.\" Henry inclined his own head in return, thankful that the bloodscent had been covered by the entirely unappetizing smell of basilicum powder. \"You\u0027re looking remarkably well, all things considered.\" \"I\u0027ve you to thank for that.\" \"I really did very little.\" \"True enough, you only saved my life.\" The captain\u0027s grin was infectious and Henry found himself returning it in spite of an intention to remain aloof. \"Mind you, Dr. Harris did say he\u0027d never seen such a clean wound.\" One hand rose to touch the bandages under his nightshirt. \"He said I was healing faster than any man he\u0027d ever examined.\" As his saliva had been responsible for that accelerated healing, Henry remained silent. It had seemed foolish to resist temptation when there\u0027d been so much blood going to waste. \"Anyway...\" The grin disappeared and the expressive face grew serious. \"I owe you my life and I\u0027m very grateful you came along but that\u0027s not why I asked you to visit. I can\u0027t get out of this damned bed and I have to trust someone.\" Shadowed eyes lifted to Henry\u0027s face. \"Something tells me that I can trust you.\" \"You barely know me,\" Henry murmured, inwardly cursing his choice of words the night before. He\u0027d told Evans to trust him and now it seemed he was to play the role of confidant. He could remove the trust as easily as he\u0027d placed it but something in the man\u0027s face made him hesitate. Whatever bothered him, involved life and death ¨C Henry had seen the latter too often to mistake it now. Sighing, he added, \"I can\u0027t promise anything, but I\u0027ll listen.\" \"Please.\" Gesturing at a chair, the captain waited until his guest had seated himself, then waited a little longer, apparently searching for a way to begin. After a few moments, he lifted his chin. \"You know I work at the Home Office?\" \"I had heard as much, yes.\" In the last few years, gossip had become the preferred entertainment of all classes and Varney was a devoted participant. \"Well, for the last little while ¨C just since the start of the Season, in fact ¨C things have been going missing.\" \"Things?\" \"Papers. Unimportant ones for the most part, until now.\" His mouth twisted up into a humorless grin. \"I can\u0027t tell you exactly what the latest missing document contained ¨C in spite of everything we\u0027d still rather it wasn\u0027t common knowledge ¨C but I can tell you that if it gets into the wrong hands, into French hands, a lot of British soldiers are going to die.\" \"Last night you were following the thief?\" \"No. The man we think is his contact. A french spy named Yves Bouchard.\" Henry shook his head, interested in spite of himself. \"The man who stabbed you last night was no Frenchman. I heard him speak, and he was as English as you or I. English, and though I hesitate to use the term, a Gentleman.\" \"That\u0027s Bouchard. He\u0027s the only son of an old emigre family. They left France during the revolution ¨C Yves was a mere infant at the time and now he dreams of restoring the family fortunes under Napoleon.\" \"One would have thought he\u0027d be more interested in defeating Napoleon and restoring the rightful king.\" Evans shrugged, winced and said, \"Apparently not. Anyway, Bouchard\u0027s too smart to stay around after what happened last night. I kept him from getting his hands on the document, now we have to keep it from leaving England by another means.\" \"We?\" Henry asked, surprised into ill-mannered incredulity. \"You and I?\" \"Mostly you. The trouble is, we don\u0027t know who actually took the document although we\u0027ve narrowed it down to three men who are known to be in Bouchard\u0027s confidence and who have access to the Guard\u0027s offices.\" \"One moment, please.\" Henry raised an exquisitely manicured hand. \"You want me to find your spy for you?\" \"Yes.\" \"Why?\" \"Because I can\u0027t be certain of anyone else in my office and because I trust you.\" Realizing he had only himself to blame, Henry sighed. \"And I suppose you can\u0027t bring the three in for questioning because two of them are innocent?\" Evans\u0027 pained expression had nothing to do with his wound. \"Only consider the scandal. I will if I must but, as this is Wednesday and the information must be in France by Friday evening or it won\u0027t get to Napoleon in time for it to be of any use, one of those three will betray himself in the next two days.\" \"So the document must be recovered with no public outcry?\" \"Exactly.\" \"I would have thought, the Bow Street Runners. \"No. The Runners may be fine for chasing down highway men and murderers, but my three suspects move in the best circles. Only a man of their own class could get near them without arousing suspicion.\" He lifted a piece of paper off the table beside the bed and held it out to Henry, who stared at it for a long moment. Lord Ruthven, Mr. Maxwell Aubrey, and Sir William Wyndham. Frowning, Henry looked up to meet Captain Evans\u0027 weary gaze. \"You\u0027re sure about this?\" \"I am. Send word when you\u0027re sure, I\u0027ll do the rest.\" The exhaustion shading the other man\u0027s voice reminded Henry of his injury. Placing the paper back beside the bed, he stood. \"This is certainly not what I expected.\" \"But you\u0027ll do it?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/what-manner-of-man/page-2.html","bookId":2608,"book":{"id":2608,"title":"What Manner of Man","description":"Storyline: Shortly after three o\u0027clock in the morning, Henry Fitzroy rose from the card table, brushed a bit of ash from the sleeve of his superbly fitting coat and inclined his head toward his few remaining companions. \"If you\u0027ll excuse me, gentlemen, I believe I\u0027ll call it a night.\" \"Well, I won\u0027t excuse you.\" Sir William Wyndham glared up at Fitzroy from under heavy lids. \"You\u0027ve won eleven hundred pounds off me tonight, damn your eyes, and I want a chance to win it back.\"","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/what-manner-of-man.jpg","author":"Tanya Huff","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/what-manner-of-man.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:32:45 PM"}}
