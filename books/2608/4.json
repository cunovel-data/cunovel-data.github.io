{"id":98238,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\"Bouchard too. Although he doesn\u0027t seem to be here tonight.\" So Aubrey was wrapped around Bouchard\u0027s little finger. Wrapped tightly enough to spy for the French? Henry wondered. The return of a familiar voice diverted his attention. He turned to see Sir William once again playing court to Carmilla. When she giggled and looked away, it only seemed to inspire Sir William the more. Henry moved closer until he could hear her protests. She sounded both flattered and frightened. Now that\u0027s a combination impossible to resist, Henry thought, watching Wyndham respond. With a predator\u0027s fluid grace, he deftly inserted himself between them. \"I believe this dance is mine.\" When Carmilla giggled but made no objection, there was nothing Wyndham could do but quietly seethe. Once on the floor, Henry smiled down into cornflower blue eyes. \"I hope you\u0027ll forgive me for interfering, Miss Amworth, but Sir William\u0027s attentions seemed to be bothering you.\" She dropped her gaze to the vicinity of his waistcoat. \"Not bothering, but a bit overwhelming. I\u0027m glad of the chance to gather my thoughts.\" \"I feel I should warn you, he has a sad reputation.\" \"He is a very accomplished flirt.\" \"He is a confirmed rake, Miss Amworth.\" \"Do you think he is more than merely flirting then?\" Her voice held a hint of hope. Immortality, Henry mused, would not provide time enough to understand women. Granted, Sir William had been blessed with darkly sardonic good looks and an athletic build but he was also ¨C the possibility of his being a spy aside ¨C an arrogant, self-serving libertine. Some women were drawn to that kind of danger; he had not thought Carmilla Amworth to be one of them. His gaze dropped to the pulse beating at an ivory temple and he wondered just how much danger she dared to experience. Obviously aware that she should be at least attempting conversation, she took a deep breath and blurted, \"I hear you saved Captain Evans last night.\" Had everyone heard about it? Varney would not be pleased. \"It was nothing.\" \"My maid says that he was set upon by robbers and you saved his life.\" \"Servants\u0027 gossip.\" A dimple appeared beside a generous mouth. \"Servants usually know.\" Considering his own servant, Henry had to admit the truth of that. \"Were they robbers?\" \"I didn\u0027t know you were so bloodthirsty, Miss Amworth.\" When she merely giggled and shook her head, he apologized and added, \"I don\u0027t know what they were. They ran off as I approached.\" \"Surely Captain Evans knew.\" \"If he did, he didn\u0027t tell me.\" \"It must have been so exciting.\" Her voice grew stronger and her chin rose, exposing the soft flesh of her throat. \"There are times I long to just throw aside all this so-called polite society.\" I should have fed before I came. After a brief struggle with his reaction, Henry steered the conversation to safer grounds. It wasn\u0027t difficult as Carmilla, apparently embarrassed by her brief show of passion, answered only yes and no for the rest of the dance. As he escorted her off the floor, Wyndham moved possessively toward her. While trying to decide just how far he should extend his protection, Henry saw Aubrey and Ruthven leave the room together. He heard the younger man say \"Bouchard\" and lost the rest of their conversation in the surrounding noise. Good lord, are they both involved? \"My dance this time, I believe, Fitzroy.\" Shooting Henry an obvious warning, Sir William captured Carmilla\u0027s hand and began to lead her away. She seemed fascinated by him and he, for his part, clearly intended to have her. Fully aware that the only way to save the naive young heiress was to claim her himself, Henry reluctantly went after Aubrey and Ruthven. By the time he reached King Street, the two men were distant shadows, almost hidden by the night. Breathing deeply in an effort to clear his head of the warm, meaty odor of the assembly rooms, Henry followed, his pace calculated to close the distance between them without drawing attention to himself. An experienced hunter knew better than to spook his prey. He could hear Aubrey talking of a recent race meeting, could hear Ruthven\u0027s monosyllabic replies, and heard nothing at all that would link them to the missing document or to Yves Bouchard. Hardly surprising. Only fools would speak of betraying their country so publicly. When they went into Aubrey\u0027s lodgings near Portman Square, Henry wrapped himself in darkness and climbed to the small balcony off the sitting room. He felt a bit foolish, skulking about like a common housebreaker. Captain Evans\u0027 desire to avoid a scandal, while admirable, was becoming irritating. \"Here it is.\" \"Are you sure?\" Ruthven\u0027s heart pounded as though he\u0027d been running. It all but drowned out the sound of paper rustling. \"Why would Bouchard lie to me?\" Why indeed? A door opened, and closed, and Henry was on the street waiting for Ruthven when he emerged from the building. He was about to step forward when a carriage rumbled past, reminding him that, in spite of the advanced hour, the street was far from empty. Following close on Ruthven\u0027s heels ¨C and noting that wherever the dour peer was heading it wasn\u0027t toward home ¨C Henry waited until he passed the mouth of a dark and deserted mews then made his move. With one hand around Ruthven\u0027s throat and the other holding him against a rough stone wall, his lips drew back off his teeth in involuntary anticipation of the other man\u0027s terror. To his astonishment, Ruthven merely declared with gloomy emphasis. \"Come Death, strike. Do not keep me waiting any longer.\" His own features masked by the night, Henry frowned. Mouth slightly open to better taste the air, he breathed in an acrid odor he recognized. \"You\u0027re drunk!\" Releasing his grip, he stepped back. \"Although it is none of your business, I am always drunk.\" Under his customary scowl Ruthven\u0027s dull grey eyes flicked from side to side, searching the shadows. That explained a great deal about Ruthven\u0027s near legendary melancholy and perhaps it explained something else as well. \"Is that why you\u0027re spying for France?\" \"The only thing I do for France is drink their liquor.\" The peer drew himself up to his full height. \"And Death or not, I resent your implication.\" His protest held the ring of truth. \"Then what do you want with Yves Bouchard?\" \"He said he could get me...\" All at once he stopped and stared despondently into the night. \"That also is none of your business.\" Beginning to grow irritated, Henry snarled. Ruthven pressed himself back against the wall. \"I ordered a cask of brandy from him. Don\u0027t ask me how he smuggles it through the blockade because I don\u0027t know. He was to meet me tonight at Almack\u0027s but he never came.\" \"What did Maxwell Aubrey give you?\" \"Bouchard\u0027s address.\" As the wine once again overcame his fear ¨C imitation willpower, Henry realized ¨C Ruthven\u0027s scowl deepened. \"I don\u0027t believe you are Death. You\u0027re nothing but a common-cutpurse.\" His tone dripped disdain. \"I shall call for the Watch.\" \"Go right ahead.\" Henry\u0027s hand darted forward, patted Ruthven\u0027s vest, and returned clutching Bouchard\u0027s address. Slipping the piece of paper into an inner pocket, he stepped back and merged with the night. Varney would probably insist that Ruthven should die but Henry suspected that nothing he said would be believed. Besides, if he told everyone he\u0027d met Death in an alley, he wouldn\u0027t be far wrong. As expected, Bouchard was not in his rooms. And neither, upon returning to Portman Square, was Maxwell Aubrey. Snarling softly to himself, Henry listened to a distant watchman announce it was a fine night. At just past two, it was certainly early enough for Aubrey to have gone to one of his clubs, or to a gaming hell, or to a brothel. Unfortunately, all Henry knew of him was that he was an easily influenced young man. Brow furrowed, he\u0027d half decided to head back toward St. James Street when he heard the crash of breaking branches coming from the park the square enclosed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/what-manner-of-man/page-4.html","bookId":2608,"book":{"id":2608,"title":"What Manner of Man","description":"Storyline: Shortly after three o\u0027clock in the morning, Henry Fitzroy rose from the card table, brushed a bit of ash from the sleeve of his superbly fitting coat and inclined his head toward his few remaining companions. \"If you\u0027ll excuse me, gentlemen, I believe I\u0027ll call it a night.\" \"Well, I won\u0027t excuse you.\" Sir William Wyndham glared up at Fitzroy from under heavy lids. \"You\u0027ve won eleven hundred pounds off me tonight, damn your eyes, and I want a chance to win it back.\"","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/what-manner-of-man.jpg","author":"Tanya Huff","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/what-manner-of-man.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:32:45 PM"}}
