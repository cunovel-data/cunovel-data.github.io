{"id":15798,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"One corner of Lewis Stillman\u0027s room was reserved for weapons. His prize, a Thompson submachine, had been procured from the Los Angeles police arsenal. Supplementing the Thompson were two semi-automatic rifles, a Luger, a Colt .45 and a .22-caliber Hornet pistol, equipped with a silencer. He always kept the smallest gun in a spring-clip holster beneath his armpit, but it was not his habit to carry any of the larger weapons with him into the city. On this night, however, things were different. \\n\\n \\n\\n The drains ended two miles short of Hollywood—which means he would be forced to cover a long and particularly hazardous stretch of ground in order to reach the book store. He therefore decided to take along the .30-caliber Savage rifle in addition to the small hand weapon. \\n\\n \\n\\n You\u0027re a fool, Lewis, he told himself, as he slid the oiled Savage from its leather case. Are the books important enough to risk your life? Yes, another part of him replied, they are that important. If you want a thing badly enough and the thing is worthwhile, then you must go after it. If fear holds you like a rat in the dark, then you are worse than a coward; you betray yourself and the civilization you represent. Go out and bring the books back. \\n\\n \\n\\n Running in the chill night wind. Grass, now pavement, now grass, beneath his feet. Ducking into shadows, moving stealthily past shops and theatres, rushing under the cold moon. Santa Monica Boulevard, then Highland, the Hollywood Boulevard, and finally—after an eternity of heartbeats—the book store. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pickwick\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lewis Stillman, his rifle over one shoulder, the small automatic gleaming in his hand, edged silently into the store. \\n\\n \\n\\n A paper battleground met his eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the filtered moonlight, a white blanket of broken-backed volumes spilled across the entire lower floor. Stillman shuddered; he could envision them, shrieking, scrabbling at the shelves, throwing books wildly across the room at one another. Screaming, ripping, destroying. \\n\\n \\n\\n What of the other floors? What of the medical section? \\n\\n \\n\\n He crossed to the stairs, spilled pages crackling like a fall of dry leaves under his step, and sprinted up the first short flight to the mezzanine. Similar chaos! \\n\\n \\n\\n He hurried up to the second floor, stumbling, terribly afraid of what he might find. Reaching the top, his heart thudding, he squinted into the dimness. \\n\\n \\n\\n The books were undisturbed. Apparently they had tired of their game before reaching these. \\n\\n \\n\\n He slipped the rifle from his shoulder and placed it near the stairs. Dust lay thick all around him, powdering up and swirling, as he moved down the narrow aisles; a damp, leathery mustiness lived in the air, an odor of mold and neglect. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lewis Stillman paused before a dim hand-lettered sign: MEDICAL SECTION. It was just as he had remembered it. Holstering the small automatic, he struck a match, shading the flame with a cupped hand as he moved it along the rows of faded titles. Carter ... Davidson ... Enright ... Erickson. He drew in his breath sharply. All three volumes, their gold stamping dust-dulled but readable, stood in tall and perfect order on the shelf. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the darkness, Lewis Stillman carefully removed each volume, blowing it free of dust. At last all three books were clean and solid in his hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n Well, you\u0027ve done it. You\u0027ve reached the books and now they belong to you. \\n\\n \\n\\n He smiled, thinking of the moment when he would be able to sit down at the table with his treasure, and linger again and again over the wonderous pages. \\n\\n \\n\\n He found an empty carton at the rear of the store and placed the books inside. Returning to the stairs, he shouldered the rifle and began his descent to the lower floor. \\n\\n \\n\\n So far, he told himself, my luck is still holding. \\n\\n \\n\\n But as Lewis Stillman\u0027s foot touched the final stair, his luck ran out. \\n\\n \\n\\n The entire lower floor was alive with them! \\n\\n \\n\\n Rustling like a mass of great insects, gliding toward him, eyes gleaming in the half-light, they converged upon the stairs. They had been waiting for him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now, suddenly, the books no longer mattered. Now only his life mattered and nothing else. He moved back against the hard wood of the stair-rail, the carton of books sliding from his hands. They had stopped at the foot of the stair; they were silent, looking up at him, the hate in their eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n If you can reach the street, Stillman told himself, then you\u0027ve still got half a chance. That means you\u0027ve got to get through them to the door. All right then, move. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lewis Stillman squeezed the trigger of the automatic and three shots echoed through the silent store. Two of them fell under the bullets as Stillman rushed into their midst. \\n\\n \\n\\n He felt sharp nails claw at his shirt and trousers, heard the cloth ripping away in their grasp. He kept firing the small automatic into them, and three more dropped under the hail of bullets, shrieking in pain and surprise. The others spilled back, screaming, from the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n The gun was empty. He tossed it away, swinging the heavy Savage rifle free from his shoulder as he reached the street. The night air, crisp and cool in his lungs, gave him instant hope. \\n\\n \\n\\n I can still make it, thought Stillman, as he leaped the curb and plunged across the pavement. If those shots weren\u0027t heard, then I\u0027ve still got the edge. My legs are strong; I can outdistance them. \\n\\n \\n\\n Luck, however, had failed him completely on this night. Near the intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland, a fresh pack of them swarmed toward him over the street. \\n\\n \\n\\n He dropped to one knee and fired into their ranks, the Savage jerking in his hands. They scattered to either side. \\n\\n \\n\\n He began to run steadily down the middle of Hollywood Boulevard, using the butt of the heavy rifle like a battering ram as they came at him. As he neared Highland, three of them darted directly into his path. Stillman fired. One doubled over, lurching crazily into a jagged plate-glass store front. Another clawed at him as he swept around the corner to Highland. He managed to shake free. \\n\\n \\n\\n The street ahead of him was clear. Now his superior leg-power would count heavily in his favor. Two miles. Could he make it back before others cut him off? \\n\\n \\n\\n Running, re-loading, firing. Sweat soaking his shirt, rivering down his face, stinging his eyes. A mile covered. Half way to the drains. They had fallen back. \\n\\n \\n\\n But more of them were coming, drawn by the rifle shots, pouring in from side streets, stores and houses. \\n\\n \\n\\n His heart jarred in his body, his breath was ragged. How many of them around him? A hundred? Two hundred? More coming. God! \\n\\n \\n\\n He bit down on his lower lip until the salt taste of blood was on his tongue. You can\u0027t make it, a voice inside him shouted, they\u0027ll have you in another block and you know it! \\n\\n \\n\\n He fitted the rifle to his shoulder, adjusted his aim, and fired. The long rolling crack of the big weapon filled the night. Again and again he fired, the butt jerking into the flesh of his shoulder, the smell of powder in his nostrils. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was no use. Too many of them. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lewis Stillman knew that he was going to die. \\n\\n \\n\\n The rifle was empty at last, the final bullet had been fired. He had no place to run because they were all around him, in a slowly closing circle. \\n\\n \\n\\n He looked at the ring of small cruel faces and he thought: The aliens did their job perfectly; they stopped Earth before she could reach the age of the rocket, before she could threaten planets beyond her own moon. What an immensely clever plan it had been! To destroy every human being on Earth above the age of six—and then to leave as quickly as they had come, allowing our civilization to continue on a primitive level, knowing that Earth\u0027s back had been broken, that her survivors would revert to savagery as they grew into adulthood. \\n\\n \\n\\n Lewis Stillman dropped the empty rifle at his feet and threw out his hands. \"Listen,\" he pleaded, \"I\u0027m really one of you. You\u0027ll all be like me soon. Please, listen to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But the circle tightened relentlessly around Lewis Stillman. He was screaming when the children closed in. \\n\\n \\n\\n The End \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2405/66931.html","bookId":557,"book":{"id":557,"title":"Small World","description":"简介： In the waiting windless dark, Lewis Stillman pressed into the building-front shadows along Wilshire Boulevard.
