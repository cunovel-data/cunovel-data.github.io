{"id":37037,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. THE POST-OFFICE MONEY ORDER.","content":"Robert had been to the post-office a number of times for Mr. Gray, so he made his way there after breakfast without difficulty. \\n\\n \\n\\n He found the money-order department somewhat crowded, and had to take his place at the end of a line numbering a dozen persons or more. \\n\\n \\n\\n While he was moving toward the window his attention was attracted to a loudly-dressed individual, who came in and glanced around as if looking for somebody he knew. \\n\\n \\n\\n The man singled out Robert and came up to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you acquainted here, young man?\" he asked, in a low tone, so that those standing around might not hear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" asked the youth. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was positive he had never seen the loudly-dressed individual before. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I mean do they know you at yonder window?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One of the clerks knows me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 151] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then I wish you would do me a favor. My name is Charles Shotmore. I come from Lexington. I received a money order yesterday from my aunt, with whom I reside, and I want to get the order cashed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Won\u0027t you identify me? Of course, it\u0027s a mere matter of form, but it places one in a regular hole if one is not known,\" went on the man glibly. \"You know they are very particular just at present, although they didn\u0027t used to be.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t know you,\" said Robert, with considerable surprise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have just told you my name—Charles Shotmore, of Lexington. My aunt\u0027s name is Caroline Shotmore. And your name is——?\" The man paused, expecting Robert to fill in the blank. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the youth had seen enough of city life to make him shy of strangers, and he did not mention his name. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never mind about my name,\" he said coldly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Won\u0027t you identify me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How can I when I do not know you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have just told you my name. Isn\u0027t that sufficient?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you tell them the same thing at the window?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 152] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because they are too particular.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think they are.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you won\u0027t do me the favor?\" And the loudly-dressed individual frowned darkly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I cannot, conscientiously.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Humph! it seems to me you are mighty particular.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you are very forward,\" retorted Robert, and turned his back on the fellow. The man started to say more, but suddenly turned and walked to the corner of the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n Robert had no difficulty in getting his money orders cashed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"For yourself?\" said the clerk, with a smile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re in luck.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got to use most of the money,\" answered the boy, and left the window. \\n\\n \\n\\n A hundred and fifty dollars was quite a sum, even for Robert to handle, and he placed the amount in the breast pocket of his coat. \\n\\n \\n\\n The flashily-dressed man saw the youth stow the bank bills away, and his eyes glistened greedily. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was a sharper by the name of Andy Cross, and it is doubtful if he had ever done an honest day\u0027s work in his life. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 153] \\n\\n \\n\\n The money order he carried was one belonging to a man who had been stopping at the same boarding place at which Andy Cross had put up. \\n\\n \\n\\n The order had come in a letter the day before, and Cross was anxious to get it cashed before Charles Shotmore should become aware of his loss. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve a good mind to follow that boy and see if I can\u0027t get hold of that money,\" said Cross to himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n As Robert went out of the post-office he came behind him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Not far away was a drug store, where several directories lay on a stand for the use of the public. \\n\\n \\n\\n Robert stepped into the drug store to look for Herman Wenrich\u0027s name in the directory, and Andy Cross took a stand outside where he might watch the boy. \\n\\n \\n\\n While the sharper was waiting, he felt himself touched on the arm, and wheeling about, found himself confronted by the man to whom the stolen money order belonged. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Smith, I wish to speak to you,\" said Charles Shotmore, somewhat excitedly. He did not know Cross\u0027 real name, for he had never heard it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you want?\" demanded Andy Cross,[Pg 154] as coolly as he could, although he was much disconcerted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I—I—that is, I believe you have a letter belonging to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A letter belonging to you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have no such letter, Mr. Shotmore. What makes you think I have?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The servant at the boarding house says a letter came yesterday for me, and that she saw you pick it up from the hall rack.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She is mistaken.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She says she is positive, and—and she says your record is none of the best.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sir, do you mean to insult me!\" demanded Cross, but his face turned pale with sudden fear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The girl comes from the South End, and she says you are known by the name of Cross. She is positive you took my letter, and I want it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Preposterous! Why should I take your letter?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. But I was expecting a money order from my aunt, and if it was in the letter I want it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you follow me to here?\" asked Andy Cross, nervously. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 155] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I came down to the post-office, yes, for that is where they cash money orders.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I haven\u0027t your money order, and that is all there is to it. Let go of my arm.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For Charles Shotmore had clutched the sharper while they were conversing. \\n\\n \\n\\n At that moment Robert came out of the drug store. On catching sight of Cross in the grasp of another, he paused in wonder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Something is wrong,\" he thought, and drew closer to the pair. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am of the opinion that you have the money order,\" said Charles Shotmore. \"If you are an honest man you will not object to being searched.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I do object!\" burst out Andy Cross, fiercely, and tried to wrench himself loose. He had almost succeeded when Robert came to Charles Shotmore\u0027s assistance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll help you hold him, sir,\" he said quietly, but firmly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let go, boy!\" fumed the sharper. \"Let go, or it will be the worse for you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll not let go.\" Robert turned to the other man. \"Do you know this fellow, sir?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps I had better ask you that question,\" returned Charles Shotmore, cautiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 156] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was at the post-office a while ago and he wanted me to identify him. He said his name was Charles Shotmore.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, that is my name.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He had a money order he wished to have cashed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My money order, I\u0027ll wager a new hat. You villain. I have caught you just in time,\" and Charles Shotmore clutched Cross tighter than before. \\n\\n \\n\\n It must be confessed that the sharper was nonplussed, for he had not expected to have Shotmore follow him up thus rapidly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is—er—a—a great mistake,\" he stammered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess it was a mistake—for you,\" said Shotmore grimly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If I—I have the letter, I took it by mistake,\" went on Andy Cross. \"Sometimes I have violent headaches, and during those periods I do the most extraordinary things.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed!\" sneered Charles Shotmore. \"Never mind the headaches, just you hand over the money order.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As he spoke he slipped his hand into Cross\u0027 breast pocket and drew forth the letter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mine, sure enough!\" he ejaculated. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 157] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is the money order in it?\" questioned Robert. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes. My boy, you have done me a valuable service.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am glad of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I really believe I ought to have this rascal arrested.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think you are justified, Mr. Shotmore. It\u0027s bad policy to have such dishonest persons running around loose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Arrest me?\" gasped Andy Cross. \"If you have me arrested you will make the greatest mistake of your lives.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll risk it,\" said Charles Shotmore. \\n\\n \\n\\n He started to look around for an officer. \\n\\n \\n\\n As he did so, Andy Cross gave a pull and freed himself from both Shotmore and Robert. Then he dashed into the street, among the cars and trucks going in both directions. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hi! stop him!\" cried Shotmore. \"Police! Police!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Robert at once took up the chase. Soon Shotmore joined in. But Andy Cross was fleet of foot, and fear lent speed to his feet. By the time the other side of the crowded thoroughfare was gained he was nowhere to be seen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s disappeared,\" panted Robert, coming to a halt at the corner. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 158] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So I see,\" returned Charles Shotmore. \"He could run, couldn\u0027t he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, he had something to run for.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\" Shotmore indulged in a low laugh. \"I\u0027m glad I got my letter and money order away from him before he started.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you know him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No more than that he boarded at the same house with me. I fancy he is an all-round sharper, from what the servant girl said of him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then it\u0027s a pity he escaped.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I may meet him again some day. But I owe you something for your aid.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are welcome to whatever I have done for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I would like to pay you something,\" persisted Charles Shotmore. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t wish it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"May I ask your name?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Robert gave it, and they shook hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope we meet again,\" said the gentleman, and after a few more words they parted, Shotmore going over to have his money order cashed without further delay,—he being already known at the post-office. \\n\\n \\n\\n From the directory in the drug store Robert had obtained Herman Wenrich\u0027s address. The[Pg 159] old lumberman lived on the outskirts of the city, on the other side of the Chicago River, and the youth set off for the place, little dreaming of what trouble his visit was to bring to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1801/52303.html","bookId":1053,"book":{"id":1053,"title":"Out For Business","description":"简介： In this tale are related the various haps and mishaps which befall a sturdy country youth, of high moral aim, who, by the harsh actions of his step-father, is compelled to leave what had once been the best of homes, and go forth into the world to mak...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1801","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:16 AM"}}
