{"id":37049,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXX. ANOTHER PLOT AGAINST ROBERT.","content":"Robert enjoyed his sleep, and did not awaken until after the Arrow had tied up at the dock in Muskegon. He was just finishing his toilet when Mr. Porter opened his eyes. \n \n \"Ah, so you are ahead of me!\" cried the hardware dealer, springing up. \"Have we arrived?\" \n \n \"I believe we have,\" answered Robert. \n \n \"May I ask where you are bound?\" \n \n \"For the depot. I am going to take a train for Timberville.\" \n \n \"I know the place and the route well. You cannot get a train for Timberville until eleven o\u0027clock. Here is a time-table.\" And selecting one of several from his pocket, Mr. Porter passed it over. \n \n A short examination showed Robert that his friend was right. \n \n \"It\u0027s a long wait,\" he said. \n \n [Pg 254] \n \n \"It will give you time for breakfast and a chance to look around. Supposing we dine together?\" \n \n \"Thank you! that will suit me first-rate.\" \n \n In less than half an hour they had left the boat, and were walking up the main street of Muskegon. The gentleman knew the place well, and led the way to a substantial restaurant where a good meal could be had at a reasonable figure. \n \n Hammerditch and Le Fevre had followed the youth, and now came to a halt outside of the eating resort. \n \n \"He seems to have picked up a friend,\" said the Englishman. \"That will make our task so much harder.\" \n \n \"Perhaps ze man vill not remain wid heem,\" suggested Le Fevre. \n \n Satisfied that Robert and his companion would not come out immediately, the pair went to another restaurant and procured a hasty breakfast. \n \n Mr. Porter expected to do considerable business in Muskegon, and breakfast over, he shook Robert by the hand cordially. \n \n \"We must part now,\" he said. \"I am glad to have met you, and trust we shall meet again.\" \n \n \"The same to you, Mr. Porter,\" replied our[Pg 255] hero. \"I wish you were going to Timberville with me.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m afraid I wouldn\u0027t do much there. There is only one small store and two or three sawmills. Of course, they use some hardware, but not a great deal.\" \n \n And thus they parted. \n \n By consulting a clock Robert found he had still two hours to wait before the departure of the train. Looking at the clock reminded him of his lost watch, and he had remembered how Andy Cross had said that Jim Huskin had left Chicago for Muskegon. \n \n \"I would just like to land on that fellow,\" he said to himself. \"He deserves to be in prison quite as much as Cross does.\" \n \n Walking around to the depot, Robert purchased a ticket for Timberville, made sure that he was right about the train, and had his valise checked straight through. \n \n Although he was not aware of it, his movements were shadowed by Hammerditch and Le Fevre. \n \n \"He has checked the bag,\" said the Englishman. \"I wonder if we can get at it through the baggage master?\" \n \n \"It ees not likely,\" said the French Canadian.[Pg 256] \"Za are verra particular here about baggage. If ve can get ze check ve be all right.\" \n \n \"Let us follow him and see if anything turns up in our favor.\" \n \n So the two rascals followed Robert in his walk about the town. \n \n All unconscious of the nearness of his enemies, our hero sauntered from street to street. \n \n His eyes were wide open for some glimpse of Jim Huskin, and it must be confessed that he never gave a thought to being attacked from behind. \n \n Having traveled the main thoroughfares of Muskegon, the youth commenced a tour of the streets of lesser importance. \n \n One street, near the docks, was lined with saloons, and here the worst element of the town appeared to be congregated. \n \n \"Set \u0027em up, lad,\" cried one \u0027longshoreman, as he bumped up against Robert. \n \n \"Thanks, I don\u0027t drink,\" answered Robert, coolly. \n \n \"Don\u0027t drink?\" cried the man. \"Wot yer doin\u0027 down here, then?\" \n \n \"That is my business.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t yer git uppish about it.\" \n \n \"Make him treat, Mike,\" put in another man,[Pg 257] whose nose showed that strong drink and he were no strangers. \n \n \"Come on an\u0027 have jess one glass,\" went on the man who had first addressed Robert. \n \n As he spoke he caught Robert by the shoulder. \n \n Our hero shook him off. \n \n \"Don\u0027t you dare to touch me,\" he said sharply. \"If you do you will be laying up a good bit of trouble for yourself.\" \n \n \"In fightin\u0027 trim, hey?\" \n \n \"I can defend myself, and more, if I am called upon to do it.\" \n \n The \u0027longshoreman leered at Robert for a moment. \n \n \"Yer too soft,\" he sneered, and aimed a blow for Robert\u0027s head. \n \n As quick as a flash our hero ducked, and hit out in return. The blow caught the tippler on the chin, and made him stagger up against the saloon window. \n \n \"Now I guess you\u0027ll leave me alone,\" remarked the boy. And then he walked on, but kept glancing behind him, to be prepared for another attack. \n \n \"Phew, he\u0027s a fighter, Mike,\" said the second man. \n \n \"Dat\u0027s wot he is,\" grumbled Mike, rubbing[Pg 258] his chin, where the blow had landed. \"He must be wot da call a scientific boxer, hey?\" \n \n \"Are yer goin\u0027 ter drop him?\" \n \n \"Wot shall I do?\" \n \n \"Make him treat or lick him.\" \n \n \"Maybe you want ter lick him,\" suggested Mike. \n \n \"I kin if I set out fer ter do it.\" \n \n \"Then pitch in, Pat.\" \n \n But Pat hesitated about going ahead. Robert looked strong, and he felt that the youth could not be easily intimidated. \n \n \"We kin do it tergether,\" he ventured. \n \n While the two roughs were conversing Hammerditch and Le Fevre drew near. \n \n They had seen the short encounter and saw how angry were the men who wanted to be treated. \n \n \"Got the best of you, did he?\" said Hammerditch. \n \n \"You mind your own business,\" growled Mike, crossly. \n \n \"Why didn\u0027t you pitch into him?\" went on the Englishman. \"I would have done so.\" \n \n \"Dat\u0027s wot I\u0027m a-tellin\u0027 him,\" put in Pat. \n \n \"He\u0027s a boy zat wants taking down,\" said Le Fevre. \n \n [Pg 259] \n \n The two roughs looked at the newcomers curiously. \n \n \"Do yer know de boy?\" demanded Mike. \n \n \"Yes, I know him, and I would like to see him get a sound thrashing,\" answered Hammerditch. \n \n \"Gif him what he deserves and ve vill pay you vell for eet,\" added the French Canadian. \n \n \"Wot yer down on him fer?\" questioned Pat. \n \n \"He stole a baggage check from me,\" said Hammerditch, promptly. \"Of course, he claims the check, but it is mine.\" \n \n \"I see. Do yer want ter git the check away from him?\" \n \n \"I do.\" \n \n \"Where is it?\" \n \n \"In his trousers\u0027 pocket.\" \n \n \"An\u0027 if we git it fer yer, wot will yer give us?\" asked Pat. \n \n \"Five dollars,\" quickly answered Hammerditch. \n \n To these roughs, who had not done a full day\u0027s work for a long time, five dollars appeared quite a sum of money. \n \n \"We\u0027ll go yer,\" said Pat promptly. \"Aint dat right, Mike?\" \n \n \"If you\u0027ll work wid me,\" answered Mike. \n \n \"All right; I\u0027ll follow you up for the check,\"[Pg 260] said Hammerditch. \"And here is the five dollars.\" And he showed the bill, so that they might know that he meant what he said. \n \n In a few minutes more the two roughs had laid their plans and were stealing after Robert. \n \n \"We can git dat check an\u0027 his money too,\" said Mike, and Pat agreed with him. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1801/52315.html","bookId":1053,"book":{"id":1053,"title":"Out For Business","description":"简介： In this tale are related the various haps and mishaps which befall a sturdy country youth, of high moral aim, who, by the harsh actions of his step-father, is compelled to leave what had once been the best of homes, and go forth into the world to mak...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1801","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:16 AM"}}
