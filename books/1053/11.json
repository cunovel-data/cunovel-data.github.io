{"id":37029,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER X. ROBERT GETS A PLACE.","content":"\"You can go out and take a walk, Robert, while I go with Mr. Gray to his office.\" \"All right, sir.\" \"Now,\" said Marden, as they emerged into State street, \"will you take the boy?\" \"Yes, but I can\u0027t pay him much.\" \"How much?\" \"Five dollars a week.\" \"That won\u0027t support him. He has been well brought up, and will need twelve.\" Peter Gray stopped short and whistled in his surprise. \"I can\u0027t possibly pay twelve dollars to any clerk, not even if he were experienced—and this boy probably isn\u0027t.\" \"He knows nothing of the business.\" \"Then, Marden——\" \"Stop a minute! I propose that you shall pay him twelve dollars a week, but I will undertake to pay seven of it.\" [Pg 84] \"You must take a great interest in the lad.\" \"I do—a most unusual interest.\" \"Of course that will make a difference.\" \"I should say so.\" \"In that case he can come at once.\" \"He will come day after to-morrow. To-morrow I want to show him Chicago.\" \"All right. Oh, there is one thing I must mention. I have another clerk—twenty-two years of age—whom I only pay ten dollars a week. He mustn\u0027t know that the boy gets twelve.\" \"Very well; I will caution Robert. Should the young man find out, let him understand that only five dollars come from you.\" \"That will be satisfactory.\" Marden went to the office of his old acquaintance. It was small, but as large as many in the same line of business. At four he returned to the hotel. \"Well, Robert,\" he said, \"it\u0027s arranged. You will go to work on Thursday morning. Here is the card of your employer. To-morrow I will go round the city with you.\" \"Shall I receive enough to pay my board, Mr. Marden,\" asked Robert anxiously. \"You will receive twelve dollars a week.\" Robert was amazed. [Pg 85] \"I don\u0027t see how Mr. Gray should be willing to pay me so much,\" he said. Marden smiled. \"Oh, he has a little private arrangement with me. There is another clerk, considerably older than you. He is not to know how much you get. Let him understand that it is five dollars.\" \"I understand. How generous you are, Mr. Marden.\" \"Not Mr. Marden—Dick.\" \"Well, Dick. But you ought not to pay so much for me.\" \"Why not? Consider me your uncle, and take care to do credit to my recommendation.\" \"I will,\" said Robert earnestly. \"Shall you remain in the city, Uncle Dick?\" \"I may come here now and then, but I expect day after to-morrow to go to the northern part of Michigan, to visit an old friend there, who is in the lumber business.\" \"Then, hadn\u0027t I better be looking for a boarding-place?\" \"Well thought of. We\u0027ll look over the Record and hunt up a place.\" Within an hour Robert had selected a small room not far from La Salle street, where he was to have full board for five dollars a week. The[Pg 86] room was not equal to the one he had at home, but he would spend very little time there. During the day following, Robert and his miner friend made an extensive tour of Chicago, and Robert felt impressed with the magnitude of the city and the extent of the business that was carried on in it. \"Do you think you shall like Chicago, Robert?\" \"Yes, Uncle Dick; I begin to feel like a man of business already.\" \"And you will be contented?\" \"Yes, but I shall miss you.\" \"I am glad to hear that, boy. Let me see, how long have we known each other?\" \"Only two days.\" \"And yet you seem like my own boy. I never had anyone belonging to me before.\" \"You may get tired of me, Uncle Dick.\" \"Perhaps so, but I don\u0027t believe it.\" \"Will you write to me?\" \"I\u0027m not much on letter writing, but I reckon I\u0027ll be able to scribble a few lines occasionally.\" Robert remained with the miner till Thursday morning, and then made his way to Mr. Gray\u0027s office. [Pg 87] He found a tall young man with tallowy hair and freckles standing behind the counter. \"What can I do for you, boy?\" he asked with lofty politeness. Robert smiled. \"I\u0027m the new clerk,\" he said. \"Didn\u0027t Mr. Gray mention me?\" \"I believe he did say something about hiring a boy. What\u0027s your name?\" \"Robert Frost.\" \"Well, Frost, my name is Mr. Livingston Palmer.\" \"Indeed! Are you related to Mr. Palmer who keeps the hotel?\" \"I—ahem! I believe we are distantly related. Do your people live in Chicago?\" \"No. Some distance out in the country.\" \"Got a father and mother?\" \"No, a mother—and a step-father.\" \"I sympathize with you. So have I a step-father. He drinks.\" \"I don\u0027t think that is true of Mr. Talbot—my step-father—but if he did, I should not dislike him any more. How do you like this business?\" \"So-so.\" \"Does Mr. Gray treat you well?\" [Pg 88] \"Well, I can\u0027t complain. He doesn\u0027t pay me enough salary.\" \"That is a common complaint, I suppose,\" said Robert, smiling. \"How much are you to get?\" \"From Mr. Gray—five dollars.\" \"That\u0027s what I got the first year. Now I only get ten.\" \"That is considerably more.\" \"Yes, but it isn\u0027t enough. Why, I am the brains of the establishment.\" Robert was amused. But he saw that Mr. Livingston Palmer was quite in earnest. \"How about the boss?\" \"Oh, he\u0027s a fair business man, but he couldn\u0027t get along without me.\" \"Then I hope he won\u0027t have to. I will take it as a favor if you will help me along. I am quite inexperienced. I never was in any business before.\" \"Yes, I\u0027ll look after you. If Mr. Gray knew what was to his interest, he would take me into partnership.\" \"Did you ever suggest it to him?\" \"Well, no, not exactly, but I\u0027ve given him a delicate hint, but he never seemed to understand what I meant.\" [Pg 89] Just then Peter Gray came in. He looked quite insignificant compared with either of his two clerks, but Robert soon found that he was a hustler and a good man of business. \"So you are here on time?\" he said pleasantly. \"Yes, sir.\" \"Where is my old friend, Marden?\" \"He starts this forenoon for Michigan.\" \"So? He seems to feel a great interest in you.\" \"I am glad to say he does.\" \"He says you are a smart, go-ahead boy. I hope you will prove so.\" \"I\u0027ll try, Mr. Gray.\" \"If you try you\u0027ll succeed. Now, let me tell you a little about the business. You understand that this is a cut-rate railroad ticket office?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"You\u0027ll soon get to understand our way of doing business—that is, if you pay attention.\" \"I will do that.\" The day passed, and Robert, who was on the alert, began to get an insight into the business. He found that it was not very hard, and could be soon mastered. He was not as much impressed as he expected to be by the business ability of Mr. Livingston Palmer, who had claimed to be the \"brains of the business.\" It seemed to him that[Pg 90] Mr. Palmer was slow, and prone to make mistakes, but those were only his first impressions, which might be modified hereafter. The office closed at six. \"Where do you board, Frost?\" asked the senior clerk. Robert told him. \"I have a room, and get my meals at restaurants.\" \"I don\u0027t think I should like that so well.\" \"We live on the same street. Have you any engagement this evening?\" \"No.\" \"I would invite you to go to some amusement with me, but I am almost broke.\" \"Then suppose you go to some amusement with me, Mr. Palmer?\" \"With pleasure,\" said the elder clerk, brightening up—\"that is, if you don\u0027t mind the expense.\" \"No, I can afford it.\" \"I don\u0027t see how you can on five dollars a week.\" \"Oh, I have an allowance besides.\" \"You\u0027re in luck. I wish I had.\" Mr. Palmer selected a variety theater, and Robert purchased two orchestra seats, although he[Pg 91] would have preferred some performance of a higher class. \"Do you know why I wanted to come here?\" asked Palmer in a low confidential tone. \"No. Why?\" \"There\u0027s a girl that sings here—she\u0027s a daisy, and I have reason to think that she\u0027s sweet on me. There\u0027s her name on the bill—Alameda Churchill. When she comes out, give me your opinion of her.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1801/52295.html","bookId":1053,"book":{"id":1053,"title":"Out For Business","description":"简介： In this tale are related the various haps and mishaps which befall a sturdy country youth, of high moral aim, who, by the harsh actions of his step-father, is compelled to leave what had once been the best of homes, and go forth into the world to mak...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1801","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:16 AM"}}
