{"id":37024,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER V. A CRISIS.","content":"Nothing more was said about the woodpile. Apparently Mr. Talbot concluded that he was not likely to carry his point, and prudently withdrew from the conflict. But his sense of defeat only made him the more incensed against his rebellious step-son. \n \n \"I would give five dollars to see that boy thrashed,\" he said to himself moodily, as from the window he watched Robert playing ball in the street with his friend Sam Jones. \n \n As Robert seemed to be enjoying himself, he could not resist the temptation to interfere. \n \n So he opened the window and called out, \"Robert, I wish you would stop playing ball in the street.\" \n \n \"Why?\" asked his step-son. \n \n \"Because the ball might come this way and break one of the windows.\" \n \n \"There is no chance of it, Mr. Talbot. We are sending the ball up and down the street.\" \n \n [Pg 43] \n \n \"Still there is danger.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t see it.\" \n \n \"Will you be guided by my wishes?\" demanded Talbot querulously. \n \n \"I would if they were reasonable. I don\u0027t think they are.\" \n \n \"I am the best judge of that. I don\u0027t want you to play ball in front of my house.\" \n \n \"Your house? How long has it been yours? It belongs to my mother.\" \n \n \"Your mother is my wife.\" \n \n \"I am sorry to say that you are right. But that doesn\u0027t make the house yours.\" \n \n \"I have no wish to quibble. I represent your mother, and I have a right to ask you to stop playing ball in front of the house.\" \n \n \"Even if the house were yours, you don\u0027t own the street. Go ahead, Sam!\" \n \n Mr. Talbot banged the door and went into the house. \n \n \"That is the most impudent cub I ever saw,\" he muttered. He was worsted again, and he felt angry and provoked. \n \n \"What a sweet step-father you\u0027ve got, Robert,\" said Sam. \n \n \"Isn\u0027t he? But don\u0027t call him my step-father. I want to forget that he is connected[Pg 44] with me in any way. He is constantly nagging me. I don\u0027t think I can stand it much longer.\" \n \n \"How does your mother stand it?\" \n \n \"Mother has a very sweet temper, and she has no will of her own.\" \n \n \"Unlike you,\" said Sam, smiling. \n \n \"Yes, I have a will of my own. I don\u0027t think a boy or man can succeed who hasn\u0027t.\" \n \n \"You say you can\u0027t stand it. What will that lead to?\" \n \n \"It may lead to my leaving the house, and going out into the world to seek my fortune. Our house is a large one, but it isn\u0027t large enough to contain Mr. Talbot and myself.\" \n \n \"I hope you won\u0027t have to go, Robert. I should miss you awfully.\" \n \n \"And I should miss you, Sam. But time will show.\" \n \n Probably no persons could be more incompatible, or less likely to get along together, than Robert and Mr. Talbot. The presence of one was a constant irritation to the other. This could have but one issue. One day, perhaps a week after the dispute about ball-playing, Robert entered the gate on his way back from the village. Mr. Talbot was standing on the lawn. He had scarcely entered[Pg 45] the yard when a man reeling under the influence of drink staggered by. \n \n \"That man has more than he can carry,\" observed Robert. \n \n \"Yes,\" answered Talbot with a smile. \"Take care that you don\u0027t fall into the same habit.\" \n \n \"Why do you caution me,\" asked Robert curtly. \"Do you think there is any need of it?\" \n \n \"Yes, if all that I have heard is true.\" \n \n \"What have you heard?\" \n \n \"That your father was an intemperate man.\" \n \n Robert\u0027s eyes flashed with intense anger. \n \n \"It is a lie,\" he said. \"Take it back.\" \n \n \"I have every reason to believe it is true, and I won\u0027t take it back.\" \n \n This was too much for Robert, who was a boy of spirit, and had been devotedly attached to his father. \n \n \"Take it back!\" he repeated in a tone of menace. \n \n \"Do you think I would take it back at the order of a whipper-snapper like you?\" sneered his step-father. \n \n Robert waited to hear no more. His affection and reverence for his father were so strong that he felt outraged by the insult to his memory. He[Pg 46] made a sudden attack upon his step-father, so impetuous that it dashed Mr. Talbot to the ground. \n \n The man was very much frightened. His encounter with the dog showed that he was a coward, and though he, a grown person, was attacked by a boy, he seemed helpless and over-whelmed. \n \n \"Ah—what does this mean?\" he gasped. \n \n \"It means that I won\u0027t allow you or any other man to insult my father\u0027s memory,\" answered Robert fiercely. \n \n \"I will have you arrested,\" said Talbot venomously. \n \n \"Do as you please,\" returned Robert contemptuously. \n \n He sprang to his feet, and without waiting for Mr. Talbot to rise, entered the house and sought his mother, who had not witnessed the fracas. \n \n The time had been brief, but he had already made up his mind to do what had been in his mind for some time. He would leave home and seek his fortune in the great world. He felt that to stay at home any longer—to live under the same roof as his step-father—would be absolutely impossible. He was not afraid to depend upon his own exertions. He was young, well-educated,[Pg 47] strong, and had confidence in his own ability to earn a living. He would be sorry to leave his mother of course, but his mother didn\u0027t seem to belong to him now that she was the wife of a man whom he despised. \n \n Leaving James Talbot to pick himself up at his leisure, he sought his mother, who was in the sitting room, engaged in sewing. She noticed the flush upon Robert\u0027s face, and his excited air, and asked at once, \"What\u0027s the matter, Robert? You look disturbed.\" \n \n \"I am disturbed, mother.\" \n \n \"What is it? Tell me about it.\" \n \n \"I got into a dispute with Mr. Talbot.\" \n \n \"I wish you could be friendly with him.\" \n \n \"It is impossible, mother. He is always irritating me. This time he insulted my father\u0027s memory.\" \n \n \"How did he do that?\" \n \n \"He said father was a man of intemperate habits.\" \n \n \"Surely he did not mean it,\" said his mother, looking troubled. \n \n \"I don\u0027t know whether he meant it or not. I only know that he said it. And now, mother, you mustn\u0027t take too hard what I am going to say to you.\" \n \n [Pg 48] \n \n \"What is it?\" inquired Mrs. Talbot nervously. \n \n \"I have made up my mind to leave home.\" \n \n \"Surely you would not do that,\" said his mother startled. \n \n \"Yes, it is the best way. I can\u0027t live under the same roof as Mr. Talbot. Besides I am now sixteen. It is time I was earning my own living.\" \n \n \"But that is not necessary, Robert. I have enough for you.\" \n \n \"I know it, but I can\u0027t live on you all my life. I want to go out into the world, and see what I can do for myself.\" \n \n \"Take time to think it over, Robert. You are not through school.\" \n \n \"I shall be very soon. I have a good education already, and I can get along.\" \n \n \"What do you want to do?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know yet. Something will open up for me.\" \n \n \"Wait till next week,\" pleaded his mother. \n \n \"No, I must go this very day. I have had a fight with Mr. Talbot, and I can\u0027t stay in the house any longer.\" \n \n \"Oh, Robert, you will make me very unhappy.\" \n \n \"I am sorry for that, mother, but I don\u0027t see how I can help it. Look on the bright side. I think things will turn out well for me.\" \n \n [Pg 49] \n \n \"If you must go, you must let me give you some money,\" and Mrs. Talbot, rising, went to her secretary. \n \n \"No, mother; I have twenty dollars laid by. That will do for the present. When that is gone I will write you for some more.\" \n \n \"Will you promise to do it, Robert?\" \n \n \"Yes, mother?\" \n \n \"Where do you think of going?\" \n \n \"To Chicago, first.\" \n \n \"But you don\u0027t know anyone there, and I am told there are a great many bad men there who might lead you into temptation.\" \n \n \"I hope I am strong enough to resist them. But I must go upstairs and get ready.\" \n \n Robert went up to his chamber and drew out from a closet a large grip-sack. Into this he put hurriedly a supply of shirts, socks, handkerchiefs, and underclothing. \n \n \"I came near forgetting a comb and brush,\" he said to himself, unlocking the grip-sack after it was closed. \"I am not used to traveling, but I suppose I shall be in time.\" \n \n Meanwhile, Mr. Talbot after taking time to recover his equanimity, sought his wife. \n \n \"Mrs. T.,\" he said, \"your promising son is getting worse and worse.\" \n \n [Pg 50] \n \n \"Explain yourself,\" she said coldly. \n \n \"He sprang upon me with the ferocity of a tiger, after I had made an inoffensive remark, and taking me unawares, actually threw me down. I can\u0027t endure his presence.\" \n \n \"You won\u0027t be obliged to. He has decided to leave home.\" \n \n \"Where will he go?\" \n \n \"He is going out into the world to seek his fortune,\" she answered sadly. \n \n \"He will fetch up in jail,\" said his step-father savagely. \n \n \"I think, Mr. Talbot, we will drop the subject. I do not feel equal to discussing it when my dear and only child is about to leave home, driven from it by you.\" \n \n She rose and left the room. \n \n \"Well, I\u0027m glad he\u0027s going,\" thought Talbot. \"I can the better carry out my plans.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1801/52290.html","bookId":1053,"book":{"id":1053,"title":"Out For Business","description":"简介： In this tale are related the various haps and mishaps which befall a sturdy country youth, of high moral aim, who, by the harsh actions of his step-father, is compelled to leave what had once been the best of homes, and go forth into the world to mak...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1801","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:16 AM"}}
