{"id":37052,"no":34,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII. ROBERT VISITS HOME—CONCLUSION.","content":"\"You have had lots of adventures since last we met in Chicago,\" remarked Dick Marden, while he and Robert were making the trip from Timberville to Muskegon. \n \n \"That is true, and some adventures that I didn\u0027t care much about,\" returned our hero. \n \n \"It\u0027s the way of the world, lad—you can\u0027t get through without some pretty hard knocks and dangerous brushes. But tell me frankly, what would you like to do next?\" \n \n \"I would like to obtain some good office situation. I like to keep books, write business letters, and handle money—especially if the business done is on a large scale.\" \n \n \"I understand.\" Dick Marden mused for a moment. \"I was thinking of offering you a place at Timberville, or in my mine in California; but I reckon you had best remain in Chicago. But I shan\u0027t forget to keep my eye on you, and[Pg 280] you can be sure that my uncle won\u0027t forget you if he comes out on top, as that lawyer says.\" \n \n The run to Muskegon was without special incident, and once in the town bordering the lake they found they had several hours to wait until a steamer would leave for Chicago. \n \n \"The wait will just suit me,\" said the miner. \"I want to call on a man who deals in lumber and make an arrangement with him to handle some of my uncle\u0027s output.\" \n \n The office building in which the wholesale lumber dealer did business was situated several blocks from the depot and thither the pair made their way. \n \n As they entered the wide hallway Robert suddenly clutched Dick Marden by the arm. \n \n \"There he is at last!\" he whispered. \n \n \"He? Who?\" \n \n \"That rascal who robbed me—Jim Huskin!\" \n \n And our hero pointed to where Huskin stood, in conversation with an old gentleman in black. \n \n \"You are certain he is the man?\" asked the miner. \n \n \"Yes; I would never forget that smooth face and those wicked eyes.\" \n \n \"He seems to be playing some confidence game now,\" went on Dick Marden. \n \n [Pg 281] \n \n The miner was right. Jim Huskin had the old man in black in an out of the way corner and was conversing with him in great earnestness. \n \n \"You cannot lose on the venture, Mr. Price,\" he said, as our hero and Marden drew closer. \"The shares will always be worth the money you put into them. Better let me have the check now, and I will buy them inside of the next hour.\" \n \n \"Yes, yes, but are you quite sure it is safe?\" asked the old man, in a trembling voice. \"You see, I cannot afford to lose four hundred dollars.\" \n \n \"You will not lose—I will guarantee the shares myself,\" answered the confidence man earnestly. \n \n \"Very well, if you will guarantee them,\" said the old man, and drew out his pocketbook, which held several bankbills, and a filled in check for the amount Huskin desired. \n \n At that moment Robert placed his hand upon the confidence man\u0027s shoulder. \n \n \"So we meet again, Jim Huskin,\" he said coldly. \n \n The rascal turned in amazement, and then his face fell. \n \n \"Why—er—what—who are you?\" he stammered, hardly being able to speak. \n \n \"You know very well who I am,\" answered[Pg 282] our hero. \"I am the boy you robbed in Chicago.\" \n \n \"Robbed!\" gasped the old man in black. \"Did you say robbed?\" \n \n \"I did, sir. This man is a rascal and a thief.\" \n \n \"You are mistaken——\" began Jim Huskin, but his manner showed how uncomfortable he felt. \n \n \"A rascal and a thief!\" murmured the old man, and looked as if he would faint. It did not take him long to place his pocketbook in his pocket again. \n \n Jim Huskin was a man who made up his mind quickly. He saw that Robert had the best of him, and that his only chance for safety lay in flight. Turning swiftly, he started to run from the building. \n \n But he had reckoned without Dick Marden, and he had scarcely taken two steps when the miner put out his foot and sent him sprawling in the hallway. At once a crowd began to collect. \n \n \"What\u0027s the row here?\" demanded the janitor of the building, as he rushed up. \n \n \"We\u0027ve collared a thief,\" answered Marden. \"Call a policeman.\" \n \n \"What! do you mean to have me arrested?\"[Pg 283] demanded Jim Huskin, as he got up, to find himself in the grasp of both Robert and his friend. \n \n \"That\u0027s what,\" answered the miner coolly. \n \n Jim Huskin began to expostulate, but all to no purpose. Soon an officer came in, followed by another crowd. \n \n \"What has he done?\" demanded the policeman. \n \n \"I charge him with robbing me,\" answered Robert. \"His name is Jim Huskin.\" \n \n \"My name isn\u0027t Huskin, it is Williams,\" put in the confidence man. \n \n \"Jim Huskin?\" repeated the officer. \"I\u0027ve heard that before.\" \n \n \"He and another man named Andy Cross robbed me in Chicago. Cross was caught, but this fellow came to Muskegon.\" \n \n \"Oh, yes, I remember the case now. So this is Huskin, eh? You were lucky to land on him.\" \n \n \"This is all wrong,\" persisted Huskin. He turned to the old man in black. \"Mr. Price, won\u0027t you testify that my name is Williams?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know as I will,\" was the slow answer. \"You said it was, but I have no further proof of it.\" \n \n \"He was going to get you to invest in some scheme, wasn\u0027t he?\" asked Robert. \n \n [Pg 284] \n \n \"Yes, he wanted to sell me some unlisted mining shares. Said they were a good investment.\" \n \n \"What were the shares?\" asked Dick Marden. \"I am an old miner and I know the mines pretty well.\" \n \n \"They were shares of the Golden Bucket Mine, of California.\" \n \n \"The Golden Bucket! Why, that mine gave out six years ago. It never paid back the money put into it. Why, it\u0027s dead, and so are the stocks. You had a lucky escape.\" \n \n \"I believe you,\" returned the old man, and looked greatly relieved. \n \n Inside of quarter of an hour Jim Huskin was transferred to the local jail and his capture was telegraphed to Chicago. He was searched, and on him were found about forty dollars belonging to Robert and a pawn-ticket for the watch, showing that it had been pawned in Muskegon for six dollars. Before he left the town Robert got the watch back. \n \n Later on Jim Huskin was taken back to Chicago, and he and Andy Cross were tried together, and each received a sentence of two years in State\u0027s prison for his misdeeds. \n \n On getting back to Mrs. Gibbs\u0027 boarding house[Pg 285] Robert found a telegram from his mother awaiting him. It read: \n \n \"Come home at once. Your step-father is very ill.\" \n \n Without delay our hero started for Granville, arriving there late in the evening. His mother met him at the front door, and it was plain to see that she had been weeping. \n \n \"Oh, Robert!\" she cried, and embraced him. It was several minutes before she could say more. \n \n \"Mr. Talbot is very sick then?\" asked the boy. \n \n \"Yes, very sick, and the doctor is afraid he will never get well,\" answered Mrs. Talbot. \n \n James Talbot was suffering from a sudden stroke of paralysis, which had affected his stomach and his left side. He was almost unconscious, and remained in that state for several days. During that time Mrs. Talbot was at his bedside constantly, and Robert did all he could for both. \n \n At the end of two weeks the physician pronounced James Talbot out of danger. The paralysis was gradually leaving him, and he could now take a little nourishment. \n \n His sickness seemed to have changed him won[Pg 286]derfully, and his harshness appeared to be a thing of the past. \n \n \"I have had my eyes opened,\" he said to his wife and Robert. \"I have done wrong in the past, but from now on you will find me a different man.\" \n \n These words pleased Mrs. Talbot greatly and removed a heavy load from her heart. Robert, however, said but little on the subject. \n \n \"I hope he does turn over a new leaf,\" he thought. \"But I want to test him for a while before I trust him.\" \n \n \"Your step-father will be all right now, Robert,\" said his mother, hopefully. \n \n \"I sincerely trust so,\" he answered gravely. \"For your sake even more than for my own.\" \n \n Here we will bring to a close the story of Robert Frost\u0027s adventures while \"Out for Business.\" He had succeeded in taking several forward steps in life, and had brought to grief the enemies who had tried to drag him down and overcome him. \n \n As soon as Mr. Talbot was on the mend our hero returned to Chicago and called upon Mr. Gray. The cut-rate ticket broker had already opened both his Chicago and his New York[Pg 287] offices, and he at once agreed to give the boy his position back, with two dollars per week added to his salary. The next day found Robert again working beside Livingston Palmer. \n \n \"Right glad to see you!\" cried Palmer. And he shook hands cordially. \"I reckon we have both had adventures enough for the present.\" \n \n \"I know I have,\" answered Robert. \"I hope in the future I am left alone to buckle down to business.\" \n \n For the time being all went well. But there were still many adventures in store for Robert, which will be related in a companion volume to this, entitled: \"Falling in with Fortune; or, The Experiences of a Young Secretary.\" In this book we will meet all of our old friends and some new ones, and also learn something more about James Talbot and his schemes for getting possession of the Frost fortune. \n \n And now, kind reader, good-by, in the hope that some day we will meet again. \n \n The End \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1801/52318.html","bookId":1053,"book":{"id":1053,"title":"Out For Business","description":"简介： In this tale are related the various haps and mishaps which befall a sturdy country youth, of high moral aim, who, by the harsh actions of his step-father, is compelled to leave what had once been the best of homes, and go forth into the world to mak...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1801","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:16 AM"}}
