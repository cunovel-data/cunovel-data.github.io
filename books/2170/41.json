His fingers reached his com-console before he was even awake and the viewscreen showed complete madness up and down Colony\u0027s corridors. Even outside his own locked hatchway! \"I\u0027m hungry now! I\u0027m hungry now! I\u0027m hungry now!\" The chant was a snarl in the throat of the night. There were no guns in evidence, but plenty of rocks. In a matter of blinks, Lewis was on the line. \"Morgan, we\u0027ve lost them for now.

What we\u0027ll do is let them go. If they seize food, then it\u0027ll be their responsibility when food gets even shorter. The supply does not change, you hear me? No extra food!\" \"But they\u0027re running wild throug....\" \"Let them rip things up. The repairs afterward will keep them busy. And a good riot will purge emotions for a time, wear them out physically. Then we turn it to our advantage, but only after well-reasoned consideration.\" Oakes listened for some response from Lewis, but the \u0027coder remained silent. \"Jesus?\" \"Yes, Morgan.\" Lewis sounded out of breath. \"I think that yo.... had better mov.... to the Redoubt immediately.

And the crew there is handpicked by Murdoch. They\u0027re the best. You can rely on them. And, Morga....\" Oakes tried to swallow, then: \"Yes?\" Another long pause, garbled snatches of conversation. \"Morgan?\" \"I\u0027m still on.\" \"You should go now. I\u0027ve arranged everything. We\u0027ll flood \u0027em out of the necessary passages. My people will be there within minutes: our usual signal. You should be at the shuttle hangar within fifteen minutes.\" \"But my records here!

But they have more to deal with than just murderous aliens: their ship\u0027s computer has been given artificial consciousness and has decided that it is a God. Now it is insisting - with all the not inconsiderable force of its impressive array of armaments to back it up - that the colonists find appropriate ways to worship It.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-jesus-incident-destination-void-2.jpg","author":"Frank Herbert","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-jesus-incident-destination-void-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:35:10 PM"}}
