The supplicant employs ritual and prayer in the attempt to influence (control) the dispenser of gifts. The kinship between this relationship and the days of absolute monarchs cannot be overlooked. This dependence on supplication gives to the keeper of those two essentials - the ritual paraphernalia and the purity of prayerful forms (that is, to the Chaplain...power akin to that of the gift dispenser.\\n\\n - \"Training the Chaplain/Psychiatrist,\" Moonbase Documents (from Shiprecords)\\n\\n RAJA THOMAS strode along a Colony passage with Waela TaoLini at his side. They both wore insulated yellow singlesuits with collar attachments for breather-helmets. It was first-light of Rega outside, but in here was the soft gold of dayside illumination that any Colonist could remember from shipside.\\n\\n The food of this diurn\u0027s first meal sat heavily in his stomach and he wondered at that. They were adding some odd filler to the food. What was happening to the shipside agraria? Could it be possible, as Oakes\u0027 people hinted, that Ship was cutting down on hydroponics output?\\n\\n Waela was oddly silent as she matched his pace. He glanced at her and found her studying him. Their eyes flicked past a confrontation too brief to call recognition, but an orange glow suffused her neck and face.\\n\\n Waela stared straight ahead. They were bound for the test-launch apron to inspect the new submersible gondola and its carrier. It would be tried first in the enclosed and insulated tank at the hangar before being risked in Pandora\u0027s unpredictable ocean.\\n\\n Why can\u0027t I just say no? she wondered. She did not have to get at the poet in the way Thomas ordered. There were other ways. It occurred to her then to ask herself about the society of Thomas\u0027 origins. What was his conditioning that he thinks sex is the best way to lower the psyche\u0027s guards?\\n\\n As happened on rare occasions when she was with others, Honesty spoke within her head: \"Men ruled and women were a subordinate class.\"\\n\\n She knew this had to be true. It fitted his behavior.\\n\\n Thomas was speaking silently to himself: I am Thomas. I am Thomas. I am Thoma....\\n\\n The strange thing about this inner chant which he had adopted as his personal litany was that it increased his sensitivity to doubts. Could it be something built into the name?\\n\\n Waela no longer trusts m.... if she ever did.\\n\\n What is this poet and where is he? Processing was taking an unconscionably long time with him. Will he be an arm of Ship?\\n\\n Why were they getting a poet on their team? It had to be a clue to Ship\u0027s plans. Obscure, perhap.... convolute.... but a clue. This might be the element of the deadly game which he was required to discover for himself.\\n\\n How much time do we have?\\n\\n Ship did not always play the game by rules that were just and fair.\\n\\n You\u0027re not always fair, are You, Ship?\\n\\n If you mean even-handed, yes, I am fair. The answer surprised Thomas. He had not expected Ship to respond while he walked along this corridor.\\n\\n Thomas glanced at Waela - silent woman. Her color had returned to its normal pale pink. Did Ship ever talk to her?\\n\\n I talk to her quite often, Devil. She calls me Honesty.\\n\\n Thomas missed a step in surprise.\\n\\n Does she know it\u0027s You?\\n\\n She is not conscious of that, no.\\n\\n Do You talk to others without their knowing?\\n\\n To many, very many.\\n\\n Thomas and Waela turned a corner into another portless passage, this one illuminated by the pale blue of overhead strip lighting - the color code which told them that it led outside somewhere up ahead. He glanced at Waela\u0027s hip, saw the ever-present lasgun in its holster there.\\n\\n Waela broke the silence.\\n\\n \"Those new clones that Oakes says are being used out on Dragon - what do you suppose they are?\"\\n\\n \"People with faster responses.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t trust that Lewis.\"\\n\\n Thomas found himself in agreement. Lewis remained a mystery figure - the brutal alter-ego to Oakes? There were stories about Lewis which suggested that Ship had held nothing back when lifting the lid of Pandora\u0027s box.\\n\\n They had come to the hatch into the hangar. Thomas hesitated before signaling the dogwatch to admit them. He glanced through the transparent port, saw that the sky doors of the hangar were closed. There should be little delay.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s eating you, Waela?\"\\n\\n She met his gaze. \"I\u0027ve been wondering if there\u0027s anyone I can trust.\"\\n\\n Pandora\u0027s curse, he thought, and chose to direct her suspicions at Oakes.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t we insist on an inspection team to explore everything Oakes is doing?\"\\n\\n \"Do you think they\u0027d let us?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s worth finding out.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll suggest it to Rachel when I see her.\"\\n\\n \"Call her when we get inside.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t. The roster says she\u0027s on vegetation patrol, south perimeter. I\u0027ll call her nightside.\"\\n\\n Without knowing precisely why, Thomas felt a chill at hearing this. Was that stupid Demarest woman in danger? He shook his head. They were all in danger, every moment.\\n\\n Again, Thomas peered through the port at activity in the hangar. There were bright lights around the sub. The LTA was lost in shadows above. Many workers moved around in the lighted area. He could see that they had opened the floorgate to expose the testing basin beneath the hangar. The lights glistened off exposed water beside the plaz gondola and its carrier-sub. Ahh, yes. They were mating the sub and gondola.\\n\\n So Rachel would not be back from south perimeter until nightside. He was caught by the curious persistences in Waela\u0027s ship-style language.\\n\\n Nightside.\\n\\n The irregular diurns of a planet with two suns caused few circadian problems for Colonists. They had been Shipmen, and Shipmen had a ready referent at hand: Day and Night were not times, but sides. Was there a clue here, something to help him in his search for a way to the heart of these people? He had thought that if he succeeded in communicating with the \u0027lectrokelp, this would give him the desired status.\\n\\n Anything to help us fit into the rhythms of Pandora.\\n\\n If Colonists learn to trust m.... if they look up to m.... then I can tell them what Ship really wants of them. They will believe and they will follow.\\n\\n That sub in there - would it be the key? Persistent symbols. What would persist in the symbols of an intelligent vegetable? It was intelligent. He was convinced of it. So was Waela. But the symbols remained a mystery.\\n\\n Fireflies in the night of the sea.\\n\\n Did they talk to each other beneath the waves?\\n\\n We do.\\n\\n Waela gestured at the signal switch beside the hatch.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the delay?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re mating the new gondola and the sub. I didn\u0027t want to call anyone away from that.\"\\n\\n He nodded as he saw the gondola swing into place, then he depressed the switch.\\n\\n Presently, a green-clad workman unsealed the inner locks and the hatch swung open. Slow procedure, but this was a dangerous area. Hatches could be locked either side - from inside when the skydoors were open. Everything groundside was designed to contain an attack.\\n\\n There was a musty aroma of outside within the hangar which set Thomas\u0027 nerves on edge.\\n\\n Waela preceded him across the hangar floor, striding out with that watchful swing which Colonists never put aside, head turning, gaze darting about. Her pale singlesuit fitted her body like another skin.\\n\\n He had insisted they go through Stores for the new suits. As he had ordered, they were insulated against the sea\u0027s chill, eliminating the need for insulation on the gondola. Plaz was an excellent conductor unless doubled or tripled. This decision gave them a few extra centimeters in the gondola core.\\n\\n Waela had disconcerted him when they picked up the suits. In shipside style, there were no separate dressing rooms. She had moved right into the try-on area with him. That habit of bodily candor still bothered him. He always found it necessary to turn his back when dressing or undressing with a female companion. Waela, on the other hand, remained frankly direct.\\n\\n \"Raj, did you know that you have a funny-looking mole on your butt?\"\\n\\n Without thinking, he had turned his head toward her just in time to see her stepping into her suit - breasts and pubis exposed. There was just the slightest hesitation in her while she continued dressing, as though she spoke only to his eyes, saying: \"Of course I\u0027m a woman. You knew that.\"\\n\\n He found himself intensely aware that she was a woman, and there was no denying the magnetic attraction she worked on him. There also was no denying that she knew this and was amused by it in an undefinably gentle way. This knowledge in her might even have contributed to her upset when he asked her to apply sexual pressure to the new team member.\\n\\n She was right, too. It was cheating.\\n\\n But what if Ship is cheating us?\\n\\n Doubts - always doubts. He found himself in silent agreement with some of the things Oakes had said. On the other hand, he could not fault Waela\u0027s argument: \"We don\u0027t help ourselves by cheating each other.\"\\n\\n That open candor in her attracted him as much as the chemistry of her physical presence.\\n\\n But I am the goad, the devil\u0027s advocate, the challenger. I am the knight among the pawns.\\n\\n And he knew he did not have much time. Ship might hand him an impossible deadline at any moment. Or Oakes and his crew might make good on their unspoken threat to cut this project off at the pockets as soon as they dared.\\n\\n There was no mistaking the latent anger in Waela - it betrayed itself in her stride (a bit too emphatic) and in the way she studied him now when she thought he was not looking. But she would get to Panille and ask all of the proper questions. That was the important thing.\\n\\n Thomas still felt remnants of her anger as they stepped into the glaring light and bustle at the testing apron where the new sub was cradled. She was all business as she stared up at this creation which had emerged from Thomas\u0027 commands.\\n\\n It was a fat metallic teardrop, slightly elongated, its LTA attachment eyelets extending along the top in a double ridge reminiscent of the backbone of an antediluvian Earthside monster. The principle was relatively simple. Most of the external sub was carrier for the plaz globe of the gondola at the core. Only the drive motors and fuel storage were made strong against the sea\u0027s pressures. The carrier had one more important function now visible to her eyes: Vertical lines of plaz-bubble lights extended up and down its sides - each bubble four centimeters in diameter. The trigger system to light them in sequence passed through a computer/sensor feedback program. What the sensor-eyes saw in the ocean depths, these lights could play back. The kelp\u0027s patterns would be its patterns, the kelp\u0027s rhythms its rhythms.\\n\\n The chief of Construction Services, Hapat Lavu, came out to meet them at the edge of the lighted area. He was a slender, driving man, completely bald. His gray eyes missed few details of his work and, despite a biting and accusatory tongue which delivered reprimands with thin-lipped fury, he was one of the best-liked Colonists. The common assessment was, \"You can depend on Hap.\"\\n\\n Dependability gained high marks groundside, and Hap Lavu was fighting for his reputation. Of all the equipment from his shops, only the subs had failed to match Pandora\u0027s demands. Sixteen had been lost without a trace; there had been survivors from four, and the wreckage of three others had been located on the bottom. All had been crushed or otherwise disabled by giant strands of kelp.\\n\\n Lavu\u0027s assessment was the opinion of many: \"That damn stuff can think and it\u0027s a killer.\"\\n\\n He had become an admirer of Thomas during their short association. Thomas had taken the accepted sub-components and reworked them into this new design. The only parts of the plan Lavu distrusted involved communications and pickup. He spoke to that as he greeted Thomas: \"You should have something better than the rocketsonde. They fail, y\u0027know.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll stick with it,\" Thomas said.\\n\\n He knew what worried Lavu. The ubiquitous \u0027lectrokelp not only clogged the seas, but their electrical activity jammed the communications channels - sonar to radar. Hylighter exhibited similar phenomena. Was there a relationship? There was no pattern to the jamming; it was random squirts of signal activity. Because of this, they depended on high power and line-of-sight relays waterside. Even then, a cloud of hylighters rising from the sea could block transmissions.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll have to surface before you can communicate,\" Lavu said. \"Now, if you\u0027d let me adapt the anchor cable t....\"\\n\\n \"Too many lines to the sub,\" Thomas said. \"We could tangle in them.\"\\n\\n \"Then pray that y\u0027can lift above interference for the relays to take your talk-talk.\"\\n\\n Thomas nodded agreement. The plan was to anchor the LTA in a lagoon, slip down the anchor cable in a vertical dive and stay clear of the kelp barriers.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll observe, play back their light patterns and seek any new coherent patterns in the lights or their electrical activity,\" he had said.\\n\\n It was a workable plan. Several subs had survived exploratory dives by giving a wide berth to the kelp. It was when the subs went in to take specimens that violence occurred.\\n\\n Workabl.... but with unavoidable weaknesses.\\n\\n Their LTA would hang at the surface, tethered on its anchor-line and awaiting the sub\u0027s return from the depths. A plan to have another LTA with a lift-gondola anchored or standing by aloft had been scratched. The winds were too unpredictable and it was argued that two LTAs anchored in the same lagoon would pose dangerous maneuvering problems. The necessary size of such an LTA made them difficult to handle in tight quarters. The standard procedure at the hangar was to winch them down after grappling the downhaul hawser. Instead, their LTA bag had been triple-reinforced with compartmented cells.\\n\\n These arguments went through Thomas\u0027 mind as he studied the new submersible.\\n\\n Was it worth the risk? He felt that he was challenging Ship, but the stakes were the highest.\\n\\n Will You let me die here, Ship?\\n\\n No answer, but Ship had said that his destiny was his own now. That was a rule of this game.\\n\\n If the kelp is sentient and we can make contact, the rewards will be enormous. Intelligent vegetable! Did it WorShip? It could be the key to Ship\u0027s demands.\\n\\n Ship called the kelp intelligent and that could be another twist of this game. Should he doubt?\\n\\n It occurred to Thomas then that if Ship were telling the truth, the kelp might be close to immortal. Except for specimens damaged by human intrusion, they had never seen dead kelp.\\n\\n Did it live forever?\\n\\n \"Do y\u0027still reject a standby LTA?\" Lavu asked.\\n\\n \"How long could you hold one in sight of us?\" Thomas asked.\\n\\n \"Depends on the weather, as y\u0027well know.\"\\n\\n There was resentment in Lavu\u0027s voice. He took it personally that so many of his creations had been destroyed, all of them equipped as best he knew for underwater survival. The answer, of course, was that Pandora\u0027s planet-wide sea contained perils beyond those they knew. Lavu felt that the entire project was now a challenge to him. He did not want to quit. It was more than a concern about hardware. Lavu wanted to go out as crew.\\n\\n \"How else can I learn what\u0027s needed if I don\u0027t go out m\u0027self?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Thomas said.\\n\\n All right, Ship. This will be the big throw of the dice.\\n\\n Devil, why do you persist in such overly dramatic poses? This time, he expected the response and was ready for it.\\n\\n Because they won\u0027t listen to me here unless I become bigger than life to them.\\n\\n Life can never be bigger than itself.\\n\\n Lavu patted the outer surface of the sub as Waela moved up beside him. She had been listening to the undertones in the conversation between Thomas and Lavu.\\n\\n What drives Thomas? she wondered.\\n\\n She had only the barest details about him. Out of hyb and into command of this project. Ship\u0027s doing, he said.\\n\\n Why?\\n\\n \"She\u0027s heavier than any of the others,\" Lavu said, thinking that the question in Waela\u0027s mind. \"I defy any Pandoran monster to break it.\"\\n\\n \"Did you solve the problem of filling the LTA?\" Thomas asked.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll have to get your final inflation outside,\" Lavu said, \"I\u0027ve laid on extra perimeter guards because the skydoors\u0027ll be open longer\u0027n I like.\"\\n\\n \"The sub itself?\" Waela asked.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve rigged guide cables up through the doors. That\u0027s it.\"\\n\\n Instinctively, Thomas glanced up at the iris closure of the skydoors.\\n\\n \"She\u0027ll be ready by oh-six hundred at the latest,\" Lavu said. \"You\u0027ll have a full nightside of rest before going out. Who\u0027s to ride with y\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"Not you, Hap,\" Thomas said.\\n\\n \"Bu.... .\"\\n\\n \"A new fellow named Panille is to go with us,\" Thomas said.\\n\\n \"So I\u0027ve heard. Untrained. A poet? Is that the truth?\"\\n\\n \"An expert in communication,\" Thomas said.\\n\\n \"Well, then, let\u0027s run the tank test,\" Lavu said. He turned and waved a hand signal at an aide.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll ride it with you,\" Thomas said. \"What pressure will you take it to?\"\\n\\n \"Five hundred meters.\"\\n\\n Thomas glanced at Waela. She gave the barest inclination of her head to indicate agreement, then returned her attention to the sub. It curved over her, more than three times her height at the thickest part of the teardrop near its bow. The outer carrier concealed all but the upper bubble of the plaz gondola within it. The induction propeller at the stern had been shielded in a complex baffle and screening system which reduced its effectiveness, but guarded it against kelp fouling.\\n\\n Workers ran a ladder up the side of the hull now, cushioned it with a foam blanket to keep the exterior signal lights clean, and steadied it while Lavu mounted. He spoke as he climbed.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve installed the manual override to insure that no random signal opens your hatch. You\u0027ll have to undog it by hand every time y\u0027open it.\"\\n\\n No surprises there, Thomas thought. That had been Waela\u0027s idea. There were suspicions that the kelp could control signals in a wide scanning spectrum and that some of the lost subs had merely been opened underwater by scanner-activation of their hatch motors.\\n\\n Waela scrambled up behind Lavu, leaving Thomas to follow. They were already inside when he reached the open hatch. He paused there to peer along this craft he would command. In a way, it was a small Voidship. The stabilizer fins were like solar panels. Exterior sensors for all of the cardinal directions were like a Voidship\u0027s hull eyes. And every known weak point had been multiple-reinforced.\\n\\n Backup systems piled on backup systems.\\n\\n He turned, found the top rung of the access ladder with a foot and stepped down into the gondola. It was red-lighted gloom there with Lavu and Waela already at their positions. Waela was bent over her console, checking her instruments, leaving the line of her left cheek visible to Thomas in the red light. How tender and beautiful that line was, he thought. Immediately, he suppressed a cynical laugh.\\n\\n Well, my glands are still working. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-jesus-incident-destination-void-2/page-30.html","bookId":2170,"book":{"id":2170,"title":"The Jesus Incident (Destination: Void #2)","description":"Storyline: The Jesus Incident (Destination: Void #2) \\n A determined group of colonists are attempting to establish a bridgehead on the planet Pandora, despite the savagery of the native lifeforms, as deadly as they are inhospitable.
