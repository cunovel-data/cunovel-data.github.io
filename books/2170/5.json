In its reduction of life processes, hybernation approached absolute stasis. It is nearer death than life.\\n\\n - Dictionary of Science, 101st Edition\\n\\n RAJA FLATTERY lay quietly in the hybernation cocoon while he fought to overcome his terrors.\\n\\n Ship has me.\\n\\n Moody waves confused his memories but he knew several things. He could almost project these things onto the ebon blackness which surrounded him.\\n\\n I was Chaplain/Psychiatrist on the Voidship Earthling.\\n\\n We were supposed to produce an artificial consciousness. Very dangerous, that.\\n\\n And they had produce.... something. That something was Ship, a being of seemingly infinite powers.\\n\\n God or Satan?\\n\\n Flattery did not know. But Ship had created a paradise planet for its cargo of clones and then had introduced a new concept: WorShip. It had demanded that the human clones decide how they would WorShip.\\n\\n We failed in that, too.\\n\\n Was it because they were clones, every one of them? They had certainly been expendable. They had known this from the first moments of their childhood awareness on Moonbase.\\n\\n Again, fear swept through him.\\n\\n I must be resolute, Flattery told himself. God or Satan, whatever this power may be, I\u0027m helpless before it unless I remain resolute.\\n\\n \"As long as you believe yourself helpless, you remain helpless even though resolute,\" Ship said.\\n\\n \"So You read my mind, too.\"\\n\\n \"Read? That is hardly the word.\"\\n\\n Ship\u0027s voice came from the darkness all around him. It conveyed a sense of remote concerns which Flattery could not fathom. Every time Ship spoke he felt himself reduced to a mote. He combed his way through a furry sense of subjugation, but every thought amplified this feeling of being caged and inadequate.\\n\\n What could a mere human do against a power such as Ship?\\n\\n There were questions in his mind, though, and he knew that Ship sometimes answered questions.\\n\\n \"How long have I been in hyb?\"\\n\\n \"That length of time would be meaningless to you.\"\\n\\n \"Try me.\"\\n\\n \"I am trying you.\"\\n\\n \"Tell me how long I\u0027ve been in hyb.\"\\n\\n The words were barely out of his mouth before he felt panic at what he had done. You did not address God that wa.... or Satan.\\n\\n \"Why not, Raj?\"\\n\\n Ship\u0027s voice had taken on an air of camaraderie, but so precise was the modulation his flesh tingled with it.\\n\\n \"Becaus.... because. . .\"\\n\\n \"Because of what I could do to you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Ahhhhh, Raj, when will you awaken?\"\\n\\n \"I am awake.\"\\n\\n \"No matter. You have been in hybernation for a very long time as you reckon time.\"\\n\\n \"How long?\" He felt that the answer was deeply important; he had to know.\\n\\n \"You must understand about replays, Raj. Earth has gone through its history for Me, replayed itself at My Command.\"\\n\\n \"Replaye.... the same way every time?\"\\n\\n \"Most of the times.\"\\n\\n Flattery felt the inescapable truth of it and a cry was torn from him: \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"You would not understand.\"\\n\\n \"All of that pain an....\"\\n\\n \"And the joy. Raj. Never forget the joy.\"\\n\\n \"Bu.... replay?\"\\n\\n \"The way you might replay a musical recording, Raj, or a holo-record of a classical drama. The way Moonbase replayed its Project Consciousness, getting a bit more out of it each time.\"\\n\\n \"Why have You brought me out of hyb?\"\\n\\n \"You are like a favorite instrument, Raj.\"\\n\\n \"But Bicke....\"\\n\\n \"Ohh, Bickel! Yes, he gave Me his genius. He was the black box out of which you achieved Me, but friendship requires more, Raj. You are My best friend.\"\\n\\n \"I would\u0027ve destroyed You, Ship.\"\\n\\n \"How little you understand friendship.\"\\n\\n \"So I\u0027.... an instrument. Are You replaying me?\"\\n\\n \"No Raj. No.\" Such sadness in that terrible voice. \"Instruments play.\"\\n\\n \"Why should I permit You to play me?\"\\n\\n \"Good! Very good, Raj!\"\\n\\n \"Is that supposed to be an answer?\"\\n\\n \"That was approval. You are, indeed, My best friend, My favorite instrument.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll probably never understand that.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s partly because you enjoy the play.\"\\n\\n Flattery could not suppress it; a chuckle escaped him.\\n\\n \"Laughter suits you. Raj.\"\\n\\n Laughter? He remembered little laughter except the bitter amusement of self-accusation. But now he remembered going into hyb - not once, but more times than he cared to count. There had been other awakening.... other games an.... yes, other failures. He sensed, though, that Ship was amused and he knew he was supposed to respond.\\n\\n \"What are we playing this time?\"\\n\\n \"My demand remains unfulfilled, Raj. Humans somehow cannot decide how to WorShip. That\u0027s why there are no more humans now.\"\\n\\n He felt frigid cold all through his body.\\n\\n \"No mor.... What\u0027ve You done?\"\\n\\n \"Earth has vanished into the cosmic whirl, Raj. All the Earths are gone. Long time, remember? Now, there are only Shipme.... and you.\"\\n\\n \"Me, human?\"\\n\\n \"You are original material.\"\\n\\n \"A clone, a doppelganger, original material?\"\\n\\n \"Very much so.\"\\n\\n \"What are Shipmen?\"\\n\\n \"They are survivors from the most recent replays - slightly different replays from the Earth which you recall.\"\\n\\n \"Not human?\"\\n\\n \"You could breed with them.\"\\n\\n \"How are they different?\"\\n\\n \"They have similar ancestral experiences to yours, but they were picked up at different points in their social development.\"\\n\\n Flattery sensed confusion in this answer and made a decision not to probe i.... not yet. He wanted to try another tack.\\n\\n \"What do You mean they were picked up?\"\\n\\n \"They thought of it as rescue. In each instance, their sun was about to nova.\"\\n\\n \"More of Your doing?\"\\n\\n \"They have been prepared most carefully for your arrival, Raj.\"\\n\\n \"How have they been prepared?\"\\n\\n \"They have a Chaplain/Psychiatrist who teaches hate. They have Sy Murdoch who has learned the lesson well. They have a woman named Hamill whose extraordinary strength goes deeper than anyone suspects. They have an old man named Ferry who believes everything can be bought. They have Waela and she is worthy of careful attention. They have a young poet named Kerro Panille, and they have Hali Ekel, who thinks she wants the poet. They have people who have been cloned and engineered for strange occupations. They have hungers, fears, joy....\"\\n\\n \"You call that preparation?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, and I call it involvement.\"\\n\\n \"Which is what You want from me!\"\\n\\n \"Involvement, yes.\"\\n\\n \"Give me one compelling reason I should go down there.\"\\n\\n \"I do not compel such things.\"\\n\\n Not a responsive answer, but Flattery knew he would have to accept it.\\n\\n \"So I\u0027m to arrive. Where and how?\"\\n\\n \"There is a planet beneath us. Most Shipmen are on that planet - Colonists.\"\\n\\n \"And they must decide how they are supposed to WorShip?\"\\n\\n \"You are still perceptive, Raj.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027d they say when You put the question to them?\"\\n\\n \"I have not put this question to them. That, I hope, will be your task.\"\\n\\n Flattery shuddered. He knew that game. It was in him to shout a refusal, to rage and invite Ship\u0027s worst reprisal. But something in this dialogue held his tongue.\\n\\n \"What happens if they fail?\"\\n\\n \"I break th.... recording.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-jesus-incident-destination-void-2/page-5.html","bookId":2170,"book":{"id":2170,"title":"The Jesus Incident (Destination: Void #2)","description":"Storyline: The Jesus Incident (Destination: Void #2) \\n A determined group of colonists are attempting to establish a bridgehead on the planet Pandora, despite the savagery of the native lifeforms, as deadly as they are inhospitable.
