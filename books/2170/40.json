Humankind lost a certain useful practicality when it chose the other Semitic response - never to forgive and never to forget. - Lost People, Shiprecords LEGATA SAT back, her whole body shaking and trembling. She could tell by the flickering cursor on the com-console that it was almost dayside. Familiar activities soon would begin out in Ship\u0027s corridors - familiar but with a feeling of sparseness because of the diminished crew. She had kept illumination low during nightside, wanting no distractions from the holorecord playing at the focus in front of Oakes\u0027 old divan. Her gaze lifted and she saw the mandala she had copied for Oakes\u0027 quarters at the Redoubt. Looking at the patterns helped restore her, but she saw that her hands still shook. Fatigue, rage or disgust? It required a conscious effort to still the trembling. Knots of tension remained in her muscles, and she knew it would be dangerous for Oakes to walk into his old cubby right now. I\u0027d strangle him. No reason for Oakes to come shipside now. He was permanently groundside. The prisoner of his terrors. As I wa.... unti.... She took a deep, clear breath. Yes, she was free of the Scream Room. It happened, but I am here now. What to do about Oakes? Humiliation. That had to be the response. Not physical destruction, but humiliation. A particular humiliation. It would have to be at once political and sexual. Something more than embarrassment. Something he might think of to do against someone else. The sexual part was easy enough; that was no challenge to a woman of her beauty and genius. But the politic.... Should I conceal the evidence that I\u0027ve seen this holo? Save that information for the proper moment. That was a good thought. Trust her own inspiration. She keyed the com-console and typed in: SHIPRECORDS EYES ONLY LEGATA HAMILL. Then the little addition which she had discovered for herself: SCRAMBLE IN OX. There. No matter who thought to search for such a datum, it would be lost in that strange computer which she had discovered in one of her history hunts. I\u0027ll stay shipside this diurn. She would not feel well. That would be the message to Oakes. He would grant her a rest period without question. She would spend her time here pulling every trick of computer wizardry she could to get the complete record on Morgan Oakes. Political humiliation. Political and sexual. That had to be the way of it. Perhaps that other Ceepee brought out of hyb, that Thomas, might hold a clue. Something in the way he looked at Oake.... as though he saw an old acquaintance in a new rol.... And she owed a debt to Thomas. Strange that he should be the only one to know she had run the P. He had kept the secret without being aske.... or asking. Rare discretion. She had no thought of fatigue now. There was food shipside when she needed it. The power of Oakes\u0027 position made that no problem. She sent her message to Oakes groundside, turned to the console. Somewhere in the records there would be a useful fact or two. Something Oakes had hidden or that he did not even know about himself - perhaps something he had done and did not want revealed. He was good at this concealment game but she knew herself to be better at it. She began at the main computer - Ship\u0027s major interface with Shipmen. Would it take fancy programming? A painstaking search through coded relationships which could hide bits of data far in the recesses of offshoot circuitry such as that Ox gate? How about the Ox gate? She hid things there, but had never asked it about Oakes. She tapped out a test routine, keyed it and waited. Presently, data began flowing across the small screen on the console. She stared. That simple? It was as though the material were waiting for her to ask. As though someone had prepared a bio for her to discover. Everything she needed was there - facts and figures. \"Suspect everyone,\" Oakes had said. \"Trust no one.\" And here he was being proved right beyond his wildest fears. The text kept rolling out. She backed it up, keyed for printout, and set it in motion once more. The heading of the record was the most surprising thing of all. MORGAN LON OAKES. Cloned. Raised, as he would put it, \"like a common vegetable.\" Out of the axolotl tanks and into an Earthside womb. Why? There it was even as she asked. \"To conceal the fact that it could be done, the birth was made to appear natural.\" It was a feat of politics worthy of Shi.... or Oakes. Did he know? How could he know? She stopped the printout and asked who else had called up this data. \"Ship.\" It was an answer she had never before seen. Ship had worked with this data. Fearfully, she asked why Ship had called up the bio on Oakes. \"To store it in a special record for Kerro Panille should he ever desire to write a history.\" She pulled her hands away from the keys. Am I talking to Ship? Panille was one of those who said he talked to Ship. Not one of the fools, then. A...fool? She found herself more fearful of this discovery than she had been of the Scream Room. Ship dealt in powers far beyond those of Oakes and Lewis and Murdoch. She glanced around the enlarged cubby - pretentious damned place. Her gaze fell on the mandala. He had taken the movable hangings. The mystical design lay exposed against a bare metal bulkhead of silvery gray. It appeared lifeless to her, robbed of some original breath. I\u0027m not worthy of talking to Ship. This had been an acciden.... a dangerous accident. Hesitantly, she started the Oakes bio printing once more. Words again flowed across the screen and the printer rattled with its text. Legata heaved a deep sigh of relief. Perilous ground. But she had escaped. This time. She felt that something strange was happening, some new program awakening in Ship. It was a feeling in her shoulderblades. Something even more awesome might happen and she was right in the middle of it. Her attention returned to the Oakes bio. That had been a time of great scurrying about Earthside, great secrets. Salvation and survival - whatever the label - the arrival of Ship and the desperation of doomed people. Desperation breeds extremes if nothing else. \"Legata.\" It was Oakes calling her name and she felt her heart skip a beat. But it was the console override. He was calling her from groundside. \"Yes?\" \"What are you doing?\" \"My job.\" She glanced at the com-console telltales to see if he could find out what she was reading. It was still blocked by the Ox gate. He recognized the sound of the printer, though. \"What are you printing out?\" \"Some data you\u0027ll find interesting.\" \"Ahhhh, yes.\" She could almost see his mind working on this. Legata had something she would not trust to the open channels between Ship and ground. She would show it to him, though. It must be interesting. I\u0027ll have to find something juicy, she thought. Something about Ferry. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here. \"What do you want?\" she asked. \"I\u0027ve been expecting you groundside.\" \"I\u0027m not feeling well. Didn\u0027t you get my signal?\" \"Yes, my dear, but we have urgent matters demanding our attention.\" \"But it\u0027s not full dayside yet, Morgan. I couldn\u0027t sleep and I still have work here.\" \"Is everything all right?\" \"Just busy,\" she said. \"This cannot wait. We need you.\" \"Very well. I\u0027m coming down.\" \"Wait for me at the Redoubt.\" At the Redoubt! He broke the connection and it was only then that she realized he had spoken of needing her. Was that possible? Alliance or love? She did not think there was much room for love in the convoluted patterns of Morgan Oakes. Sooner expect Lewis to start raising a pet Runner. Either way, Oakes wanted her presence. That gave her a wedge into the power she needed. Something still nagged at her, though - the one fear above all others: What if he does love me? Once, she had thought she wanted him to love her. There was no question that he was the most interesting man she had ever met. Unpredictably terrifying, but interesting. There was much to be said for that. Will I destroy him? The printer finished producing the Oakes bio. She folded it, crossed to the mandala looking for a place to conceal the thick wad of Shipscript. The mandala was fixed solidly to the bulkhead. She turned and glanced around the cubby. Where to hide this? Do I need to hide it? Yes. Until the right moment. The divan? She crossed to the divan and knelt beside it. The thing was fixed to the deck by bolts. Could she call a serviceman? N.... she didn\u0027t dare let anyone suspect what she was doing. Gritting her teeth, she put two fingers on a bolt and twisted. The bolt turned. Strength has its purposes! The bolts removed, she lifted the end of the divan. My! It was heavy. She doubted that three men could lift it. She slipped the text under the divan, restored the bolts, twisting them tight. Now for something juicy about Win Ferry. She stood up and returned to the console. Ferry gave her no difficulty either. He practiced no discretion whatsoever. Poor old fool! I\u0027m going to destroy Oakes for you, Win. No! Don\u0027t trick yourself into nobility. You\u0027re doing it on your own and for yourself. Let\u0027s keep love and the glory of others out of it.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-jesus-incident-destination-void-2/page-40.html","bookId":2170,"book":{"id":2170,"title":"The Jesus Incident (Destination: Void #2)","description":"Storyline: The Jesus Incident (Destination: Void #2) A determined group of colonists are attempting to establish a bridgehead on the planet Pandora, despite the savagery of the native lifeforms, as deadly as they are inhospitable.
