{"id":98742,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"I play the song to which you must dance. To you is left the freedom of improvisation. This improvisation is what you call free will.\n - The Oakes Covenant\n \"THE MEETING will please come to order.\"\n Oakes used his wand-amplifier to dominate the shuffling and buzzing in the Colony\u0027s central meeting hall. It was a domed and circular room truncated by a narrow platform against the south wall where he stood. When not being used for meetings, the room was taken over by manufacture of food-production equipment and the sub-assembly operations for the buoyant bags of the LTAs. Because of this, all meetings had to be called at least ten hours in advance to give workers time to clear away machines and fabrics.\n He still felt beset by the tensions of moving from shipside to groundside. His time sense was upset by the diurnal shift and this meeting had been rushed. It was almost the hour of mid-meal here. There would be psychological pressures from the audience because of that.\n This was the wrong hour for a meeting and there had been some muttering about interference with important work, but Murdoch had silenced that by leaking the announcement that Oakes had come groundside to stay. The implications were obvious. A major push was impending to make Colony secure; Oakes would command that push.\n On the platform with Oakes stood Murdoch and Rachel Demarest. Murdoch\u0027s position as director of Lab One was well known, and the mystery surrounding that lab\u0027s purposes made his presence here a matter of intense curiosity.\n Rachel Demarest was another matter. Oakes scowled when he thought about her. She had learned things while acting as a messenger between Ferry and groundside.\n Sounds in the room were beginning to subside as the stragglers made their way in and took seats. Portable chairs had been provided, many constructed from the twisted Pandoran plant material. The unique appearance of each chair offended Oakes. Something would have to be done to standardize appearances here.\n He scanned the room, noting that Raja Thomas was present in a seat down front. The woman beside Thomas fitted the description Murdoch had provided of one Waela TaoLini, a survivor of the original kelp-research projects. Her knowledge might be dangerous. Wel.... she and the poet would share Thomas\u0027 fate. End of that problem!\n Oakes had been groundside for almost two diurns now and much of that time had been taken up in preparation for this meeting. There had been many eyes-only reports from Lewis and his minions. Murdoch had been quite useful in this. He would bear watching. Legata had provided some of the data and, even now, was back shipside gathering more.\n This meeting represented a serious challenge to his powers, Oakes knew, and he intended to meet it head on. Lewis had estimated that about a thousand people were here. The larger part of Colony personnel could never be spared from guard and maintenance and building and rebuilding. Two steps forward, one step back - that was Pandora\u0027s way. Oakes was aware, though, that most of those facing him down on that floor carried the proxy votes of associates. There had been an unofficial election and this would be a real attempt at democracy. He recognized the dangers. Democracy had never been the ship-side way and it could not be allowed groundside. It was a sobering thought and he felt adrenaline overcoming an earlier indulgence in wine.\n The people were taking a devilish long time to get settled, moving about, forming groups. Oakes waited with what show of patience he could muster. There was a dank, metallic smell in the room which he did not like. And the lights had been tuned too far into the green. He glanced back at the Demarest woman. She was a slight figure with unremarkable features and dull brown hair. She was notable only for her intensely nervous mannerisms. Demarest had been the instigator of the electio...petition-bearer. Oakes managed a smile when he looked at her. Lewis had said he knew how to defuse her. Knowing Lewis, Oakes did not probe for details.\n Presently, Rachel Demarest came forward on the platform. Leaving her wand-amplifier on its clip at her wrist, she raised both arms, twisting her palms rapidly. It was interesting that the room fell silent immediately.\n Why didn\u0027t she use her amplifier? Oakes wondered. Was she an anti-tech?\n \"Thank you all for coming,\" she said. Her voice was high and squeaky with a whine at the edge. \"We won\u0027t take much of your time. Our Ceepee has a copy of your petition and has agreed to answer it point by point.\"\n Your petition! Oakes thought. Not my petition. Oh, no.\n But evidence from Lewis and Murdoch was clear. This woman wanted a share in Colony power. And she had managed most cleverly to say Ceepee with an emphasis which made the title appear foolish. Battle, therefore, was joined.\n As Demarest stepped back, glancing at him, Oakes produced the petition from an inner pocket of his white singlesuit. Making it appear accidental, he dropped the petition. Several pages fluttered off the platform.\n \"No matter.\" He waved back people in the front row as they moved to recover the pages. \"I remember everything in it.\"\n A glance at Murdoch brought him a reassuring nod. Murdoch had found chairs for himself and Demarest. They sat well back on the platform now.\n Oakes hunched forward toward his audience in a gesture of confidence, smiling. \"Few of our people are here this morning and you all know the very good reasons for this. Pandora is unforgiving. We all lost loved ones in the four failures on Black Dragon.\"\n He gestured vaguely westward where the rocky eminences of Black Dragon lay hidden beyond the mists of more than a thousand kilometers of ocean. Oakes knew that none of those failures could be laid at his hatch; he had been very careful about that. And his presence permanently groundside imparted a feeling of excitement about Colony prospects here on the undulating plains of The Egg. That sense of impending success had contributed to the confrontation brewing in this room. Colonists were beginning to think beyond the present state of siege, rubbing their wishes together, shaping their desires for personal futures.\n \"As most of you know,\" Oakes said, lifting his amplifier to make his voice carry, \"I am groundside to stay, groundside to direct the final push for victory.\"\n There was a polite spatter of applause, much less than he had expected. It was high time he came groundside! He had loyalties to weld, organization to improve.\n \"The Demarest petition, then,\" he said. \"Point One: elimination of one-man patrols.\" He shook his head. \"I wish it could be done. Perhaps you don\u0027t understand the reason for them. I\u0027ll put it plainly. We are conditioning the animals of Pandora to run like hell when they see a human!\"\n That brought a rewarding burst of applause.\n Oakes waited for it to subside, then: \"Your children will have a safer world because of your bravery. Yes, I said your children. It is my intent to bring the Natali groundside.\"\n Shocked murmurs greeted this announcement.\n \"This will not happen immediately,\" Oakes said, \"but it will happen. Now - Point Two of the Demarest petition.\" He pursed his lips in recollection. \"\u0027No major decision about Colony risks or expansion shall be made without approval by a clear majority of Colonists voting in Council.\u0027 Do I have that right, Rachel?\" He glanced back at her but did not wait for her to respond.\n Glancing once more at the scattered papers of the petition on the floor below him, he looked hard at the front row and swept his gaze across the audience.\n \"Putting aside for the moment the vagueness in that word \u0027clear\u0027 and this unexplained concept of \u0027Council,\u0027 let me point out one thing we all know. It took ten hours to clear this room for a meeting. We have a choice. We keep this hall clear and ready at all times, thereby putting a dangerous strain on production facilities, or we accept a ten-hour delay for every major decision. I prefer to call those survival decisions, by the way.\" He made a show of looking back at the large wall chrono, then returned his attention to the audience. \"We\u0027ve already been here more than fifteen minutes and obviously we will use more time on this.\"\n Oakes cleared his throat, giving them a moment in which to absorb what he had said. He noted a few squirmers in the audience sending signals that they would like to comment on this argument, and he had not missed the fact that Murdoch had taken Rachel Demarest\u0027s arm, whispering in her ear and, incidentally, keeping her from interrupting.\n \"Point Three,\" Oakes said. \"More rest and recuperation back on the ship. If w....\"\n \"Ship!\" Someone in the middle rows shouted. Oakes identified the speaker, a guard on the hangar perimeter squad, one of Demarest\u0027s supporters. \"Not the ship, but Ship!\" The man, half out of his seat, was pulled back by a companion.\n \"Let\u0027s face that then,\" Oakes said. \"I presume that a Chaplain/Psychiatrist has a modicum of expertise with which to address this question.\"\n He glanced at Rachel Demarest who still was being held quietly but firmly by Murdoch. You want to use titles? Very well, let us put this title into its proper perspective. Not Ceepee, but Chaplain/Psychiatrist. All the traditions of THE ship stand behind me.\n \"I will spell it out for you,\" Oakes said, turning once more to the audience. \"We are a mixed bag of people. Most of us appear to have come from Earth where I was born. We were removed by the shi....\"\n \"Ship saved you!\" That damned guard would not stay silent. \"Ship saved you! Our sun was going nova!\"\n \"So the ship says!\"\n Oakes gave it a bit more volume by a touch on his wand\u0027s controls. \"The facts are open to other interpretation.\"\n \"The fact....\"\n \"What have we experienced?\" Oakes drowned him out and then reduced the volume. \"What have we experienced?\" Lower volume still. \"We found ourselves on the ship with other people whose origins are not clear, not clear at all. Some clones, some naturals. The ship taught us its language and controlled our history lessons. We learn what the ship wants us to learn. And what are the ship\u0027s motives?\"\n \"Blasphemy!\"\n Oakes waited for the stir of this outcry to subside, then: \"The ship also trained me as a doctor and a scientist. I depend on facts I can test for myself. What do I know about Shipmen? We can interbreed. In fact, this whole thing could be a geneti....\"\n \"I know my origins and so does everyone else!\" It was Rachel Demarest breaking away from Murdoch and leaping to her feet. She still was not using her wand, but she fumbled with it as she moved toward Oakes. \"I\u0027m a clone, but I\u0027m fro....\"\n \"So the ship says!\"\n Again, Oakes hurled that challenge at them. Now, if Lewis and Murdoch had read the Colonists correctly, suspicions had been placed like barbs where they would do the most good when the vote was called.\n \"So the ship says,\" Oakes repeated. \"I do not doubt your sincerity; I merely am aghast at your credulity.\"\n She was angered by this and, still fumbling with her wand, failed to give herself enough amplification when she said: \"That\u0027s just your interpretation.\" Her voice was lost on all but the first rows.\n Oakes addressed the audience in his most reasonable manner: \"She thinks that\u0027s just my interpretation. But I would be failing you as your Chaplain/Psychiatrist if I did not warn you that it is an interpretation you must consider. What do we know? Are we merely some cosmic experiment in genetics? We know only that the shi....\" He gestured upward with his left thumb. \"...brought us here and will not leave. We are told we must colonize this planet which the ship calls Pandora. You know the legend of Pandora because it\u0027s in the ship\u0027s educational records, but what do you know about this planet? You can at least suspect that the name is very appropriate!\"\n He let them absorb this for several blinks, knowing that many among them shared his suspicions.\n \"Four times we failed to plant a Colony over on Black Dragon!\" he shouted. \"Four times!\"\n Let them think about their lost loved ones.\n He glanced at Rachel Demarest, who stood three paces to his left, staring at him aghast.\n \"Why this planet and not a better one?\" Oakes demanded. \"Look at Pandora! Only two land masses: this dirt under us which the ship calls The Egg, and that other one over there which killed our loved one - Black Dragon! And what else has the ship given us? The rest of Pandora? What\u0027s that? A few islands too small and too dangerous for the risking. And an ocean which harbors the most dangerous life form on the planet. Should we give thanks for this? Should w.... ?\"\n \"You promised to take up the entire petition!\"\n It was Rachel Demarest again and this time with her amplifier turned up too far. The intrusion shocked the audience and there were clear signs that many found the shock offensive.\n \"I will take it up, Rachel.\" Very soft and reasonable. \"Your petition was a needed and useful instrument. I agree that we should have better procedures for work assignments. Calling this deficiency to my attention strengthens us. Anything which strengthens us meets my immediate approval. I thank you for it.\"\n She got her wand under control.\n \"You imply that the \u0027lectrokelp is the most dangerou....\"\n \"Rachel, I already have started a project which will try to determine if there is something useful to us about the kelp. The director of that project and one of his assistants are sitting right down there.\"\n Oakes pointed down at Thomas and Waela, saw heads turned, people craning to see.\n \"Despite the dangers,\" he said, \"very potent and obvious dangers, as anyone will agree who has studied the data from these oceans, I have started this project. Your petition comes after the fact.\"\n \"Then why couldn\u0027t we have learned this whe.... ?\"\n \"You want more open communication from those of us making the decisions?\"\n \"We want to know whether we\u0027re succeeding or failing!\" Again, she had her amplifier turned too high.\n \"Reasonable,\" Oakes said. \"That is one of the reasons I have moved myself and my staff permanently groundside. In my hea....\" He tapped his skull. \"...is the complete plan to make Pandora into a garden planet fo....\"\n \"We should have Council members o....\"\n \"Rachel! You propose having your people at key positions? Why your people? What record of success do they have?\"\n \"They\u0027ve survived down here!\"\n Oakes fought to conceal anger. That had been a low blow. She implied that he had remained safely ensconced shipside while she and her friends risked Pandora\u0027s perils. A reasonable tone was the only way to meet that challenge.\n \"I\u0027m down here now,\" he said. \"I intend to stay. I will submit to your questions at any mutually acceptable time, despite the fact which we all know - time taken to debate our problems could be used to better advantage for Colony as a whole.\"\n \"Will you answer our questions today?\"\n \"That\u0027s why I called this meeting.\"\n \"Then what\u0027s your objection to having an elected Council whic.... ?\"\n \"Debating time, just that. We don\u0027t have the time for such a luxury. I agreed with those who objected that this meeting took us away from more important work, from food. But you insisted, Rachel.\"\n \"What\u0027re you doing over on Black Dragon?\" That was the objectionable perimeter guard down in the audience, taking a new tack now.\n \"We are attempting to build another foothold for Colony over on Dragon.\"\n Reasonabl.... reasonable, he reminded himself. Keep your voice reasonable.\n \"Dividing your energies?\" Rachel Demarest demanded.\n \"We are using new clones provided by the ship\u0027s facilities,\" he said. \"Jesus Lewis is out there now directing the effort. I assure you that we are risking only new clones who fully understand the nature of their involvement.\"\n Oakes smiled at Rachel Demarest, recalling Murdoch\u0027s jocular admonition: \"A few lies don\u0027t hurt when you\u0027ve given them some truth to admire.\"\n Turning back to face the audience, Oakes said: \"But this diverts us from the orderly resolution of our meeting. Rather than waste our time this way, we should take the issues one at a time.\"\n His announcement about the attempt at Dragon had served its purpose, though. His listeners (even Rachel Demarest) were absorbing the implications with varying degrees of shock.\n Someone away in the right rear quadrant of the room shouted: \"What do you mean new clones?\"\n Silence followed his demand, a waiting silence which said it spoke a question in the minds of most.\n \"I\u0027ll let Jesus Lewis speak to that at another meeting. It\u0027s a technical question about matters which have been under his direct supervision. For now, I can say that the new clones are being bred and conditioned to defeat the perils we all know exist out on Dragon.\"\n There: Lewis was prepared with subtle lies and half truths. The injection of rumors and key elements of their prepared story into Colony\u0027s grapevine would tie this issue down. Most people would accept the prepared story. It was always better to know that someone else was going into danger, sparing you that necessity.\n \"You didn\u0027t answer our question about rest and recuperation,\" Rachel Demarest accused.\n \"You may not realize it, Rachel, but the schedule of shipsid...R is the most important issue before us today.\"\n \"You\u0027re not going to buy us off with shipside time!\" she said. She was clenching her wand with both hands, pointing it at him like a weapon.\n \"Again, I am aghast at your limited perception,\" Oakes said. \"You really are not fit to be making the decisions which you ask the power to make.\"\n At this direct attack, she backed two steps away from him, glared into his eyes.\n Oakes shook his head sadly. \"You have a friend down there brave enough to state the essential proble....\" Oakes pointed down at the perimeter guard who sat in red-faced anger. (Have to watch that one. A fanatic for sure.) \"...but not brave enough nor perceptive enough to see the full implications of his emotional outburst.\"\n That did it. The man was on his feet and shaking a fist at Oakes. \"You\u0027re a false Chaplain! If we follow you, Ship will destroy us!\"\n \"Oh, sit down!\"\n Oakes used almost the full amplification to drown out the man\u0027s voice. The sound-shock provided the man\u0027s companions with the interval to pull him back into his seat.\n Turning down the amplifier, Oakes asked: \"Who among you asks what I ask? An obvious question: Where did WorShip originate? With the ship. That ship!\"\n He thrust a pointing finger ceilingward. \"You all know this. But you don\u0027t question it. As a scientist, I must ask the hard physical questions. Some among you argue that the ship has been motivated by the wish to save u...beneficent savior. Some of you say WorShip is a natural response to our savior. Natural response? But what if we are guinea pigs?\"\n \"What are your origins, Oakes?\"\n That was Rachel Demarest again. Beautiful. She could not have performed better for him had she been programmed. Didn\u0027t she know that by the best guess, the naturals outnumbered the clones almost four to one? - perhaps even more. And she already had admitted to being a clone.\n \"I was a child of Earth,\" Oakes said, and once more his voice was its most reasonable. He looked directly at her, then back at the audience. A little barbering of the truth was called for now. No need to bring up the fact that old Edmond Kingston had chosen him as successor. \"Most of you know my history. I was taken by the ship and trained as Chaplain/Psychiatrist. Don\u0027t you understand what that means? The ship directed my training to lead WorShip! Don\u0027t any of you find something strange in this?\"\n Right on cue, Rachel intruded: \"That seems the most natura....\"\n \"Natural?\" Oakes allowed free reign to his rage. \"A mirror and recorder would have done just as good a job as such a Chaplain! If we have no free will, our WorShip is sham! How can the ship expect to condition me for such a task? No! I question what that ship tells us. I don\u0027t even doubt. I question! And I don\u0027t like some of the answers.\"\n This was public blasphemy on a scale few of them had ever imagined. Coming from the Chaplain/Psychiatrist it amounted to an open revolt. Oakes allowed the shock to become well seated in them before hammering it home. He raised his face to the domed ceiling and shouted: \"Why don\u0027t you strike me dead, Ship?\"\n The hall became one long-held breath while Oakes turned and smiled at Murdoch, then turned the smile on his audience. He reduced the amplifier volume to the minimum required for reaching the hall\u0027s extremities.\n \"I obey the ship because the ship is powerful. We are told to colonize this planet? Very well. That is what we are doing and we are going to succeed. But who can doubt that the ship is dangerous to us? Have you had enough food lately? Why is the ship reducing our food supplies? I am not doing this. Send a deputation shipside if you wish to verify this.\" He shook his head from side to side. \"No. Our survival requires that we depend as little as possible upon the ship, an.... eventually, no dependence upon the ship at all. Buy you with shipside time, Rachel? Hell no! I intend to save you by freeing you from the ship!\"\n It was a simple matter to read the majority reaction to this challenge. He might appear to be a fat little man but he was braver than any of them, dared more than the bravest among the.... and he was risking new clones (whatever they might be). He was also going to feed them. When it came time for the question: \"Put me out of office or continue me. But no more of this democracy and Council crap.\" When it came time for that, it was clear they would support him by acclamation. He was their brave leader, even against Ship, and few could doubt it now.\n Both Lewis and Murdoch argued for a bit more insurance, though, and Oakes knew it would do no harm to follow their script.\n \"It has been suggested that we introduce complicated and time-consuming forms into our survival efforts,\" Oakes said, his voice tired. \"The ones who propose this may be sincere but they are dangerous. Slow reactions will kill us all. We are required to act more swiftly than the deadly creatures around us. We cannot wait for debate and group decisions.\"\n As both Lewis and Murdoch had insisted she would do when faced with defeat, Rachel Demarest tried the personal attack. \"What makes you think your decisions will save us?\"\n \"We are alive and Colony prospers,\" Oakes said. \"My first effort here, my primary reason for being here, is to direct a crash program to increase food production.\"\n \"No one else could do wha....\"\n \"But I will!\" He allowed just a touch of mild reproof into his tone. Anyone who could defy Ship could certainly solve the food problem. \"We all know that I did not make those decisions which killed our loved ones on Dragon. If I had been making those decisions, we might still be alive and growing out there.\"\n \"What decisions? You talk abou....\"\n \"I would not have wasted our energy trying to understand life forms which were killing us! Simple sterilization of the area was indicated and Edmond Kingston could not bring himself to order it. He paid for that failure with his lif.... but so did many innocents.\"\n She still wanted her reasonable confrontation.\n \"How can you fight what you don\u0027t understand?\"\n \"You kill it,\" Oakes said, facing her and lowering the amplification. \"It\u0027s that simple: You kill it.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-jesus-incident-destination-void-2/page-27.html","bookId":2170,"book":{"id":2170,"title":"The Jesus Incident (Destination: Void #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Jesus Incident (Destination: Void #2) \n A determined group of colonists are attempting to establish a bridgehead on the planet Pandora, despite the savagery of the native lifeforms, as deadly as they are inhospitable.
