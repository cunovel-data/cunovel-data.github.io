So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.\n - Christian Book of the Dead, Shiprecords\n FOR KERRO Panille, his last sensible thought was the beauty of the lead hylighter passing within two meters overhead. He felt the presence of the sea and the wind, saw the black twisting mass of tendrils and the long rope of them which he knew linked the magnificent creature to its ballast rock. Then he was knocked off his feet and clutched at the only possible handhold - that long rope of guiding tendrils.\n From his study of them, Panille knew that the creatures were considered to be dangerously hallucinogenic, explosive and poisonous to Shipmen, but nothing could have prepared him for the actual experience. As his hand touched the hylighter he experienced an electric buzzing which climbed to a crescendo in every sense of his body. He tasted bitter iron. The musk of uncounted flowers savaged his nostrils. His ears were the citadel of the fiercest attack - cymbals and twanging strings competed with horns and the cries of birds. Behind this assault, he heard the choral singing of a multitude.\n Then his sense of balance went crazy.\n Silence.\n The sensations were turned off as though by a switch.\n Am I dead? Is this real?\n You live, humankerro.\n In a way, it was like the voice of Ship. It was calm, faintly amused, and he knew it occurred only in his head.\n How do I know that?\n Because you are a poet.\n Wh.... who are you?\n I am that which you call hylighter. I save you from the sea.\n The beautifu....\n Yes! The beautiful, gorgeous, magnificent hylighter!\n There was pride in this announcement, but still that sense of amusement.\n You called m.... humankerro.\n Yes - humankerro-poet.\n What does being a poet have to do with my knowing this is real?\n Because you trust your senses.\n As though these words opened a door to his body, he felt the enclosing tendrils, the sharp bite of wind between them, and his inner ears registered the roll of a sweeping turn as the hylighter tacked. His eyes reported a shadowy golden area millimeters from his nose and he knew he lay on his back in a cradle of tendrils, the body of the hylighter close above him.\n What did you do to me?\n I touched your being.\n Ho....\n Again, he experienced the savage assault on his senses, but this time there was pattern in it. He detected bursts of modulation too fast for him to separate into coherent bits. His sense of sight registered pictures and he knew he was looking down with hylighter vision upon the se.... and the gondola from which he had been snatched. He felt that he must cling to these sensations as he clung to his sanity. Madness lurked at the edges of his awarenes....\n And once more, the assault stopped with shocking abruptness.\n Panille lay gasping. It was like being immersed in all the most beautiful poetry that humankind had ever produced - everything simultaneous.\n You are my first poet, and all poets are known through you.\n Panille sensed an elemental truth in this.\n What are you doing with me? he asked. It was very much like talking to Ship in his head.\n I strive to prevent the death of human and of Self.\n That was reasonable.\n Panille could make no response to this. All the thoughts which occurred to him felt inadequate. Poison from the gondola had killed kelp. The hylighters, known to originate in the sea, obviously resented this. Yet, this hylighter would save a human. It occurred to him then that he was talking to a source which could explain the relationship between kelp and hylighter. Before he could think through his question, the voice filled his head, a single thoughtburst: Hylighterself-kelpself-all-one.\n It was like Ship asking him about God. He sensed another elemental truth.\n Poet know.... This thought twined around in his mind until he could not tell if it originated with the hylighter or with himself. Poet know.... poet know....\n Panille felt himself washed in this thought. It was still with him when he realized that he was conversing with the hylighter in no language he could recall. The thoughts occurre.... he understood the.... but of all the languages he knew, none coincided with the structure of this exchange.\n Humankerro, you speak the forgotten language of your animal past. As I speak rock, you speak this language.\n Before Panille could respond he felt the tendrils opening around him. It was a most curious sensation: He was both the tendrils and himself, and he knew he was clinging to the Avata as he was clinging to his own sanity. Curiosity was his grip upon his being. How curious this experience! What poetry it would make! Then he knew he was being dangled over the sea: The foam at the edge of a kelp\u0027s fan leaf caught his attention and held it. He was not afraid; there was only that enormous curiosity. He wanted to drink in everything that was happening and preserve it to share with others.\n Wind whipped past him. He smelled it, saw it, felt it. He was turning in the grasp of the hylighter and he saw a mounded mass of hylighters directly below. They opened like flower petals expanding to reveal the gondola in their midst - orange petals and the glistening gondola.\n With gentle sureness, tendrils lowered him into the flower, into the gondola\u0027s hatch. They followed him, spreading around the interior of the gondola. He knew he was there with Waela and Thomas, yet still saw the flower as its petals closed.\n An orange blaze surrounded him and he saw through the plaz, the hylighters all around, holding the gondola in a basket of tendrils.\n Again, the wild play of his senses resumed, but now it was slower and he could think between the beats of it. Yes, there were Thomas and Waela, eyes glazed - terrified or unconscious.\n Help them, Avata. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-jesus-incident-destination-void-2/page-44.html","bookId":2170,"book":{"id":2170,"title":"The Jesus Incident (Destination: Void #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Jesus Incident (Destination: Void #2) \n A determined group of colonists are attempting to establish a bridgehead on the planet Pandora, despite the savagery of the native lifeforms, as deadly as they are inhospitable.
