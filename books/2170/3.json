{"id":98718,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"The all-pervading, characterless background of the universe - this is the void. It is not object nor senses. It is the region of illusions. - Kerro Panille, Buddha and Avata WILD VARIETY marked the naked band of people hobbling and trudging across the open plain between bulwarks of black crags. The red-orange light of a single sun beat down on them from the meridian, drawing purple shadows on the coarse sand and pebbles of the plain. Vagrant winds whisked at random dust pockets, and the band gave wary attention to these disturbances. Occasional stubby plants with glistening silver leaves aligned themselves with the sun in the path of the naked band. The band steered a course to avoid the plants. The people of the band showed only remote kinship with their human ancestry. Most of them turned to a tall companion as their leader, although this one did not walk at the point. He had ropey gray arms and a narrow head crowned by golden fuzz, the only suggestion of hair on his slender body. The head carried two golden eyes in bony extrusions at the temples, but there was no nose and only a tiny red circle of mouth. There were no visible ears, but brown skin marked the spots where ears might have been. The arms ended in supple hands, each with three six-jointed fingers and opposable thumb. The name Theriex was tattooed in green across his hairless chest. Beside the tall Theriex hobbled a pale and squat figure with no neck to support a hairless bulb of head. Tiny red eyes, set close to a moist hole which trembled with each breath, could stare only where the body pointed. The ears were gaping slits low at each side of the head. Fat and corded arms ended in two fingerless fleshy mittens. The legs were kneeless tubes without feet. Others in the band showed a similar diversity. There were heads with many eyes and some with none. There were great coned nostrils and horned ears, dancers\u0027 legs and some stumps. They numbered forty-one in all and they huddled close as they walked, presenting a tight wall of flesh to the Pandoran wilderness. Some clung to each other as they stumbled and lurched their way across the plain. Others maintained a small moat of open space. There was little conversation - an occasional grunt or moan, sometimes a plaintive question directed at Theriex. \"Where can we hide, Ther? Who will take us in?\" \"If we can get to the other sea,\" Theriex said. \"The Avat....\" \"The Avata, yes, the Avata.\" They spoke it as a prayer. A deep rumbling voice in the band took it up then: \"All-Human one, All-Avata one.\" Another spoke: \"Ther, tell us the story of Avata.\" Theriex remained silent until they were all pleading: \"Yes, Ther, tell us the stor.... the story, the stor....\" Theriex raised a ropey hand for silence, then: \"When Avata speaks of beginning, Avata speaks of rock and the brotherhood of rock. Before rock there was sea, boiling sea, and the blisters of light that boiled it. With the boiling and the cooling came the ripping of the moons, the teeth of the sea gone mad. By day all things scattered in the boil, and by night they joined in the relief of sediment and they rested.\" Theriex had a thin whistling voice which carried over the shuffling sounds of the band\u0027s passage. He spoke to an odd rhythm which fitted itself to their march. \"The suns slowed their great whirl and the seas cooled. Some few who joined remained joined. Avata knows this because it is so, but the first word of Avata is rock.\" \"The rock, the rock,\" Theriex\u0027s companions responded. \"There is no growth on the run,\" Theriex said. \"Before rock Avata was tired and Avata was many and Avata had seen only the sea.\" \"We must find the Avata se....\" \"But to grip a rock,\" Theriex said, \"to coil around it close and lie still, that is a new dream and a new life - untossed by the ravages of moon, untired. It was vine to leaf then, and in the new confidence of rock came the coil of power and the gas, gift of the sea.\" Theriex tipped his head back to look up at the metallic blue of the sky and, for a few paces, remained silent, then: \"Coil of power, touch of touches! Avata captured lightning that day, curled tight around its rock, waiting out the silent centuries in darkness and in fear. Then the first spark arced into the horrible night: \u0027Rock!\u0027\" Once more, the others responded, \"Rock! Rock! Rock!\" \"Coil of power!\" Theriex repeated. \"Avata knew rock before knowing Self; and the second spark snapped: I! Then the third, greatest of all: I! Not rock!\" \"Not rock, not rock,\" the others responded. \"The source is always with us,\" Theriex said, \"as it is with that which we are not. It is in reference that we are. It is through the other that Self is known. And where there is only one, there is nothing else. From the nothing else comes no reflection of Self, nothing returns. But for Avata there was rock, and because there was rock there was something returned and that something was Self. Thus, the finite becomes infinite. One is not. But we are joined in the infinite, in the closeness out of which all matter comes. Let Avata\u0027s rock steady you in the sea!\" For a time after Theriex fell silent, the band trudged and hobbled onward without complaint. There was a smell of acid burning on the whisking breezes, though, and one of the band with a sensitive nose detected this. \"I smell Nerve Runners!\" he said. A shudder ran through them and they quickened their pace while those at the edges scanned the plain around them with renewed caution. At the point of the band walked a darkly furred figure with a long torso and stumpy legs which ended in round flat pads. The arms were slim and moved with a snakelike writhing. They ended in two-fingered hands, the fingers muscular, long and twining, as though designed to reach into strange places for mysterious reasons. The ears were motile, large and leathery under their thin coat of fur, pointing now one direction and now another. The head sat on a slender neck, presenting a markedly human face, although flattened and covered with that fine gauze of dark fur. The eyes were blue, heavy-lidded and bulging. They were glassy and appeared to focus on nothing. The plain around them, out to the crags about ten kilometers distant, was devoid of motion now, marked only by scattered extrusions of black rock and the stiff-leaved plants making their slow phototropic adjustments to the passage of the red-orange sun. The ears of the furred figure at the point suddenly stretched out, cupped and aimed at the crags directly ahead of the band. Abruptly, a screeching cry echoed across the plain from that direction. The band stopped as a single organism, caught in fearful waiting. The cry had been terrifyingly loud to carry that far across the plain. A near-hysterical voice called from within the band: \"We have no weapons!\" \"Rocks,\" Theriex said, waving an arm at the extruded black shapes all around. \"They\u0027re too big to throw,\" someone complained. \"The rocks of the Avata,\" Theriex said, and his voice carried the tone he had used while lulling his band with the story of Avata. \"Stay away from the plants,\" someone warned. There was no real need for this warning. They all knew about the plants - most poisonous, all capable of slashing soft flesh. Three of the band already had been lost to the plants. Again, that cry pierced the air. \"The rocks,\" Theriex repeated. Slowly, the band separated, singly and in small groups, moving out to the rocks where they huddled up to the black surfaces, clinging there, most of them with faces pressed against the darkness. \"I see them,\" Theriex said. \"Hooded Dashers.\" All turned then to look where Theriex looked. \"Rock, the dream of life,\" Theriex said. \"To grip rock, to coil around it close and lie still.\" As he spoke, he continued to stare across the plain at the nine black shapes hurtling toward him. Hooded Dashers, yes, many-legged, and with enfolding hoods instead of mouths. The hoods retracted to reveal thrashing fangs. They moved with terrifying speed. \"We should have taken our chances at the Redoubt with the others!\" someone wailed. \"Damn you, Jesus Lewis!\" someone shouted. \"Damn you!\" They were the last fully coherent words from the band as the Hooded Dashers charged at blurring speed onto its scattered members. Teeth slashed, claws raked. The speed of the attack was merciless. Hoods retracted, the Dashers darted and whirled. No victim had a second chance. Some tried to run and were cut down on the open plain. Some tried to dodge around the rocks but were cornered by pairs of demons. It was over in blinks, and the nine Dashers set to feeding. Things groped from beneath the rocks to share the feast. Even nearby plants drank red liquid from the ground. While the Dashers fed, subtle movements changed the craggy skyline to the north. Great floating orange bags lifted above the rocky bulwarks there and drifted on the upper winds toward the Dashers. The floaters trailed long tendrils which occasionally touched the plain, stirring up dust. The Dashers saw this but showed no fear. High wavering crests rippled along the tops of the bags, adjusting to the wind. A piping song could be heard from them now, like wind through sails accompanied by a metallic rattling. When the orange bags were still several kilometers distant, one of the Dashers barked a warning. It stared away from the bags at a boil of stringy tendrils disturbing the plain about fifty meters off. A strong smell of burning acid wafted from the boil. As one, the nine Dashers whirled and fled. The one which had fed on Theriex uttered a high scream as it raced across the plain, and then, quite clearly, it called out: \"Theriex!\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-jesus-incident-destination-void-2/page-3.html","bookId":2170,"book":{"id":2170,"title":"The Jesus Incident (Destination: Void #2)","description":"Storyline: The Jesus Incident (Destination: Void #2) A determined group of colonists are attempting to establish a bridgehead on the planet Pandora, despite the savagery of the native lifeforms, as deadly as they are inhospitable.
