{"id":98722,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Why are you humans always so ready to carry the terrible burdens of your past?\\n\\n - Kerro Panille, Questions from the Avata\\n\\n SY MURDOCH did not like coming out this close to Colony perimeter, even when sheltered behind the crysteel barrier of Lab One\u0027s private exit. Creatures of this planet had a way of penetrating the impenetrable, confounding the most careful defenses.\\n\\n But someone Lewis trusted had to man this observation post when the hylighters congregated on the plain as they were doing this morning. It was their most mysterious form of behavior and lately Lewis had been demanding answers - no doubt jumping to commands from The Boss.\\n\\n He sighed. When he looked out on the unprotected surface of Pandora, there was no denying its immediate dangers.\\n\\n Absently, he scratched his left elbow. When he moved his head against the exterior light, he could see his own reflection in the Plaz: a blocky man with brown hair, blue eyes, a light complexion which he kept meticulously scrubbed.\\n\\n The vantage point was not the best available, not as good as the exterior posts which were always manned by the fastest and the best the Colony could risk. But Murdoch knew he could argue his importance to the leadership team. He was not expendable and this place did serve Lewis\u0027 purpose. The crysteel barrier, although it filtered out almost a fourth of the light, framed the area they needed to watch.\\n\\n What was it those damned floating gasbags did out there?\\n\\n Murdoch crouched behind a swivel-mounted scope-cum-vidicorder, and touched the controls with a short, stubby finger to focus on the \u0027lighters. More than a hundred of them floated above the plain about six kilometers out.\\n\\n There were some big orange monsters in this mob, and Murdoch singled out one of the biggest for special observation, reading what he saw into a small recorder at his throat. The big \u0027lighter looked to be at least fifty meters in diameter, a truncated sphere somewhat flattened along the top which formed the muscular base for the tall, rippling sail membrane. Corded tendrils trailed down to the plain where it grasped a large rock which bumped and dragged along the surface, kicking up dust, scattering gravel.\\n\\n The morning was cloudless, only one sun in the sky. It cast a harsh golden light on the plain, picking out every wrinkle and contraction of the \u0027lighter\u0027s bag. Murdoch could make out a cradle of smaller enfolding tentacles cupped beneath the \u0027lighter, confining something which squirmed ther.... twisting, flailing. He could not quite identify what the \u0027lighter carried, but it definitely was alive and trying to escape.\\n\\n The mob of accompanying \u0027lighters had lined out in a great curved spread which was sweeping now across the plain on a diagonal path away from Murdoch\u0027s observation post. The big one he had singled out anchored the near flank, still confining that flailing something in the tentacle shadows beneath it.\\n\\n What had that damned thing captured? Surely not a Colonist! Murdoch backed off his focus to include the entire mob and saw then that they were targeting on ground creatures, a mixed lot of them huddled on the plain. The arc of hylighters swept toward the crouching animals which waited mesmerized. He scanned them, identifying Hooded Dashers, Swift Grazers, Flatwings, Spinnerets, Tubetuckers, Clingey.... demons - all of them deadly to Colonists.\\n\\n But apparently not dangerous to hylighters. All of the \u0027lighters carried ballast rocks, Murdoch saw, and now the central segment of the sweeping arc dropped their rocks. The bags bounced slightly and tendrils stretched out to snatch up the crouching demons. The captive creatures squirmed and flailed, but made no attempt to bite or otherwise attack the \u0027lighters.\\n\\n Now, all but a few of the ballasted \u0027lighters dropped their rocks and began to soar. The few still carrying rocks tacked out away from the capture team, appearing to search the ground for other specimens. The monster bag which Murdoch had studied earlier remained in this search group. Once more, Murdoch enlarged the image in the scope, focusing in on the cupped tendrils beneath the thing\u0027s bag. All was quiet there now and, as he watched, the tendrils opened to release their catch.\\n\\n Murdoch dictated his observations into the recorder at his throat: \"The big one has just dropped its catch. Whatever it is it appears to be desiccated, a large flat area of blac.... My God! It was a Hooded Dasher! The big \u0027lighter had a Hooded Dasher tucked up under the bag!\"\\n\\n The remains of the Dasher struck the ground in a geyser of dust.\\n\\n Now, the big \u0027lighter swerved left and its rock ballast scraped the side of another large rock on the plain. Sparks flew where the rocks met and Murdoch saw a line of fire spurt upward to the \u0027lighter which exploded in a flare of glowing yellow. Bits of the orange bag and a cloud of fine blue dust drifted and sailed all around.\\n\\n The explosion ignited a wild frenzy of action on the plain. The other bags dropped their captives and soared upward. The demons on the ground spread out, some dashing and leaping to catch the remnants of the exploded \u0027lighter. Slower creatures such as the Spinnerets crept toward fallen rags of the orange bag.\\n\\n And when it was over, the demons sped away or burrowed into the plain as was the particular habit of each.\\n\\n Murdoch methodically described this into his recorder.\\n\\n When it was done, he scanned the plain once more. All of the \u0027lighters had soared away. Not a demon remained. He shut down the observation post and signaled for a replacement to come up, then he headed back toward Lab One and the Garden. As he made his way along the more secure lighted passages, he thought about what he had seen and recorded. The visual record would go to Lewis and later to Oakes. Lewis would edit the verbal observations, adding his own comments.\\n\\n What was it I saw and recorded out there?\\n\\n Try as he might to understand the behavior of the Pandoran creatures, Murdoch could not do it.\\n\\n Lewis is right. We should just wipe them out.\\n\\n And as he thought of Lewis, Murdoch asked himself how long this most recent emergency at the Redoubt would keep the man out of touch. For all they really knew, Lewis might be dead. No one was completely immune to the threats of Pandora - not even Lewis. If Lewis were gon....\\n\\n Murdoch tried to imagine himself elevated to a new position of power under Oakes. The images of such a change would not form. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-jesus-incident-destination-void-2/page-7.html","bookId":2170,"book":{"id":2170,"title":"The Jesus Incident (Destination: Void #2)","description":"Storyline: The Jesus Incident (Destination: Void #2) \\n A determined group of colonists are attempting to establish a bridgehead on the planet Pandora, despite the savagery of the native lifeforms, as deadly as they are inhospitable.
