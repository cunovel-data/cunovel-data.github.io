{"id":98771,"no":57,"title":"Page 57","content":"Through the process of nostalgic filtering, Earth assumed for the Shipmen fairyland characteristics. The different strains of people, telling their different historical memories, could only make such stories mix in a paradise setting. No Shipman ever experienced every Earthly place and clime and society. Thus, over the many generations, the reinforcement of positive memories left only the faith in how things were. - Kerro Panille, History of the Avata LEGATA SAT at a comdesk in the working space assigned to her at the Redoubt. It was a small room and showed signs of hasty construction. Directly in front of her across the desk was an oval hatch leading into her own private cubby, a space she seldom occupied now. But Oakes was busy somewhere and she had seized this opportunity. She punched for shiprecords, keyed for her own private code, and waited. Did they still have contact with Ship? The instrument buzzed. Glyphs danced across the screen in the desk. She punched for the Ox gate, set up a random-barrier lock and began transferring the data on Oakes into the Redoubt\u0027s own storage system. There you are, Morgan Lon Oakes! And the printout remained secreted in Oakes\u0027 old cubby shipside should she ever need it. It was remotely possible that Oakes might stumble on this record here, might erase it and even trace back to the original to erase that. But the printout would remain, stamped with Ship\u0027s imprimatur. When she had reviewed the data to reassure herself, and once more checked the random-barrier, she keyed the lock, then turned to the question of Lewis. It was not enough to have power over Oakes. Lewis held to his own power base like a man aware of every threat. She did not like the way he stared at her, secretive and measuring. The Ox gate gave her its open-files response and she asked for anything available about Jesus Lewis. Immediately the activity light at the command console winked out. She jiggled the switch. Nothing. She tried the override sequence, Oakes\u0027 private code, the vocoder. Nothing. When I asked for material on Lewis. It had to be a coincidence. She went through the entire contact routine once more. Ship\u0027s records could not be brought into this console. She stood up, went out and into the passage, through the tension and bustle of E-clone Processing, and borrowed one of their consoles. Same result. We\u0027re cut off. She thanked the pale, thin-fingered E-clone who had stepped aside at her request and returned to her own cubby. She knew that the right thing to do would be to tell Oakes. With Colony gone and no communication to Ship, they were isolated, alone in the wilderness that pressed inward all around the Redoubt. Yes - Oakes would have to be told. She sat down at her desk, called on Voice-Only when nothing else responded, and when he snapped that he was busy, insisted that her information transcended any other business. Oakes heard her out in silence, then: \"We\u0027re trapped.\" \"How can we be trapped?\" she asked. \"There\u0027s no one to trap us.\" \"They\u0027ve set us up,\" he insisted. \"Wait there for me.\" The \u0027coder blapped at his sudden disconnection and it was only then she realized that Oakes had not asked where she was. Did he spy on her all the time? How much of what I di.... how much did he see? In less than a minute, Oakes stepped through the hatch, his white singlesuit drenched in sweat. He was speaking as he entered, crackling tension in his voice. \"That TaoLini woman, Panille and Thomas - they\u0027re out to destroy us!\" He stopped just inside the room, glared down at her across the comdesk. \"That\u0027s impossible! I saw the hylighter carry Thomas off. And Panill....\" \"They\u0027re alive, I tell you! Alive and plotting against us.\" \"Ho.... ?\" \"More clones have revolted! And we\u0027ve had a strange message from Ferry, threatening. They\u0027re somewhere nearby, some valley, Lewis thinks. People and equipment. They\u0027re going to attack.\" \"How could anyon.... ?\" \"Probe flights, Lewis is sending out probes. And there is something out there. They\u0027re able to drive our search instruments crazy - some kind of interference that Lewis can\u0027t explain - but we\u0027re still getting indications of a lot of life and metal.\" \"Where?\" \"South.\" He gestured vaguely. \"What were you doing when the ship broke contact?\" \"Nothing,\" she lied. \"The circuitry just went dead.\" \"We need that contact, the people still up there, the material and food. Get them back.\" \"I\u0027ve tried. Here, see for yourself.\" She slid out of the seat and gestured for him to take it. \"N.... no.\" He seemed actually afraid to sit at her comdesk. \".... trust your efforts. I jus....\" She slipped back into her seat. \"You just what?\" \"Nothing. See if you can contact Lewis. Tell him to meet me at the Command Center.\" Oakes turned on his heel. The hatch hissed closed behind him. She keyed a search for Lewis and fed the message into it, then tried once more to contact Ship. No response. She sat back and stared at the comdesk. A feeling of regret swept over her, pre-remorse, a sense of sorrow over the Morgan Oakes who might have been. He was nearing the very kind of desperation she wanted. Let someone attack the Redoubt. Whatever happened, she would be ready with the material she had stored here. At the worst possible moment, Morgan Lon Oakes! You may be able to appreciate my timing, although you never have before. Would it happen in front of Thomas? Was it possible that Thomas had survived and would lead an attack? She thought it distinctly possible. Thomas - another Ceepee. The unfailing Thomas who had seen her run the P, who had helped her in that desperate hour, then said nothing of it to anyone. Discreet. Kind and discreet. Almost a lost breed. Doubts began to fill her mind then. Perhaps the survival of humans groundside really did depend on Oakes and Lewis. But Colony was gone and the Redoubt was clearly under siege from the planet, if not from some nebulous force headed by Thomas. She thought of the Scream Room then. Where did the Scream Room figure in any scheme of survival? The Scream Room was unjustifiable by any standards. It betrayed negative, anti-survival impulses. Everything about it, that proceeded from it, brought death or hunger or a terrifying subservience. No - not survival. Oakes put me through the Scream Room. Nothing would ever change that. But Thomas had guarded the perimeter hatch for her. His were survival instincts. She determined then that she would see what she could do to keep the Thomas breed from dying out. At what cost? she wondered then, her doubts returning. At what cost?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-jesus-incident-destination-void-2/page-57.html","bookId":2170,"book":{"id":2170,"title":"The Jesus Incident (Destination: Void #2)","description":"Storyline: The Jesus Incident (Destination: Void #2) A determined group of colonists are attempting to establish a bridgehead on the planet Pandora, despite the savagery of the native lifeforms, as deadly as they are inhospitable.
