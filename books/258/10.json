The man was clad in the faded uniform of a Confederate surgeon, and proved to be Dr. Mackey. \"Good-mornin\u0027, sah,\" said Old Ben politely, as the doctor leaped from the saddle and came forward. \"Good-morning,\" returned the surgeon shortly. \"Can you supply me with a glass of good drinking water? I left my flask at camp, and I am dry.\" \"We has de best ob watah heah, sah,\" returned Old Ben, and proceeded to obtain a goblet. \"Does yo\u0027 belong to de army?\" \"Yes, I am a surgeon attached to the Fifth Virginia regiment.\" The visitor gazed around him curiously. \"Is this your boathouse?\" \"Kind o\u0027, sah. It belongs to de Ruthven plantation. But when my ole massa—Heaben bless his spirit—sot me free, he gib me de right to use de boathouse so long as I pleased. I lives in yonder cabin on de bluff.\" \"Ah! then you were one of Mr. Ruthven\u0027s slaves?\" \"Colonel Ruthven, sah,\" said the colored man, with emphasis on the military title. \"He is dead?\" \"Yes, sah; killed at de bloody battle ob Gettysburg. He was leadin\u0027 a charge when a bullet struck him in de head.\" \"Too bad, truly. Did he leave much of a family?\" \"A widow, sah, an\u0027 two chillen, a boy an\u0027 a girl.\" \"I see.\" The doctor drank the water thoughtfully. \"Did—er—I mean, I think I have seen the two young people. They don\u0027t seem to resemble each other very much.\" \"Well, you see, da aint persackly brother an\u0027 sister.\" \"No?\" and the surgeon raised his heavy eyebrows as if in surprise. \"No, sah. Massah Jack is only de \u0027dopted son ob de late colonel.\" \"Ah, is that really so? A—er—nephew, perhaps?\" \"No, he aint no kin to de Ruthvens. He was washed ashoah from a wrack ten or \u0027leben years ago. I wouldn\u0027t tell dis, only it has become public property durin\u0027 de las\u0027 two weeks.\" Dr. Mackey started back. \"Ha! I have found the boy at last!\" he muttered to himself, as he began to walk the floor. \"What did you say, sah?\" \"It\u0027s quite like a romance, my man. I should like to hear more of the boy\u0027s story.\" \"Dere aint much to tell, massah. It blowed great guns durin\u0027 dat storm. De passengers an\u0027 crew was washed ashoah from de wrack, but de only ones wot came to de beach alive was Massah Jack an\u0027 his poor dear mother.\" \"And the mother——\" The doctor paused. \"She only libed fo\u0027 two days. She died up to de house, leabin\u0027 de boy to Mrs. Ruthven. De missus promised to look after de boy as her own—an\u0027 she has gone dun it, too, sah.\" \"Then Mrs. Ruthven doesn\u0027t know whose son he really is?\" \"No, sah. De boy\u0027s mammy couldn\u0027t tell nuffin, she was so much hurt.\" \"But what of the boy\u0027s father?\" \"He was drowned wid de rest ob de passengers.\" \"Hard luck—for the boy.\" The surgeon continued to pace the floor. \"By the way, what is your name?\" he asked presently. \"Ben, sah.\" \"There is a dollar for you.\" \"T\u0027ank yo\u0027, massah; you is a real gen\u0027man,\" and Ben\u0027s face relaxed into a broad smile. \"You were going out in your boat, I believe.\" \"Yes, massah. But if I kin do anyt\u0027ing fo\u0027 yo\u0027——\" \"What of this wreck? Is it the same that one can see from the bluff?\" \"Yes, massah, de werry same.\" \"It\u0027s remarkable that it should survive so long.\" \"Well, yo\u0027 see, sah, de rocks am werry high, so de most ob de storms don\u0027t git no chance at de wrack. Dat storm wot put de boat up dar was de mos\u0027 powerful dat I eber seen in all my born days.\" \"Is it possible to board the wreck now?\" \"Oh, yes, sah! I was ober dar only a few days ago. De ship was struck by lightning in dat las\u0027 storm, but de rain put out de fiah.\" \"I would like to visit the wreck. I have some time to spare to-day, and I am curious to see how such a big vessel looks when cast up high and dry on the rocks.\" \"I can take yo\u0027 ober, sah.\" \"Very well; do so, and I\u0027ll give you another dollar.\" \"I\u0027ll be ready in a minute, as soon as I gits my fishing tackle an\u0027 bait out of de boat, sah.\" Ben hurried to his craft. As he was lifting his things out he saw a man strolling near. The individual proved to be St. John Ruthven, who had come in that direction in hope of seeing Marion alone. \"Hullo, Ben!\" cried St. John. \"See anything of Marion to-day?\" \"She dun went out in a boat, sah.\" \"With Jack?\" \"Yes, sah.\" \"What, after that experience in the storm?\" \"Yes, sah.\" \"I should think they would be afraid.\" \"Da aint so afraid as some folks is, Massah St. John.\" \"Do you mean that as an insult to me, you good-for-nothing nigger?\" \"No, sah. I mean Miss Marion an\u0027 Massah Jack are wery stout-hearted.\" \"My aunt is foolish to let Marion go out with that boy. Some day Marion will be drowned.\" \"Jack knows wot he is doin\u0027, I rackon, sah.\" \"You don\u0027t know him. He is thoroughly reckless. I presume as a nobody his life isn\u0027t worth much, but——\" \"I rackon his life is as sweet to him as yours is to yo\u0027, Massah St. John.\" \"Can you take me out in a boat after them?\" \"Sorry, sah, but I\u0027se gwine to take dis gen\u0027man out, sah.\" St. John turned and saw Dr. Mackey standing near, the surgeon having come from the boathouse to listen in silence to the conversation which was taking place. He had met the doctor at the Oldville tavern the evening before, and bowed stiffly. \"I am sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Ruthven,\" said the doctor; \"but I am curious to visit the old wreck on Hemlock Bluff rocks. Perhaps this man has another boat——\" \"Oh, it doesn\u0027t matter, Dr. Mackey,\" answered St. John. \"You are evidently a cousin to Miss Marion Ruthven.\" \"I am.\" \"And a cousin to the lad named Jack.\" \"He is no cousin of mine—even though my aunt has foolishly treated him as her son.\" \"Why foolishly?\" \"He is a waif of the sea—cast up from that wreck; yet my aunt presents him to the world as a Ruthven—when he may be of very low birth.\" \"Evidently you are proud of your name.\" \"I am proud, sir, for there is no family in South Carolina which bears a better name. We are descended from St. George Ruthven, one of the knights of Queen Elizabeth\u0027s reign.\" \"I congratulate you, sir, and I now understand how this matter grates upon you. But permit me to state, the boy may prove to be of as high birth as yourself.\" \"What, Jack? Never!\" \"Do not say that. Strange things have happened in this world.\" \"But he looks as if he came of low birth,\" responded St. John haughtily. \"There I must disagree with you, Mr. Ruthven.\" \"Dat\u0027s de talk!\" muttered Old Ben, as he eyed St. John darkly. \"Massah Jack\u0027s as good as dat coward any day!\" \"As you please, doctor; but I shall hold to my opinion.\" Dr. Mackey shrugged his shoulders. \"You have that right. Come, Ben, we will be on the way. Mr. Ruthven, allow me to bid you good-day,\" and the doctor bowed stiffly. \"Good-day,\" was the curt response. Soon the surgeon and Old Ben were in the boat, and the negro was rowing swiftly in the direction of the wreck. St. John walked up the shore, but presently turned to view the doctor from a distance. \"He talks as if he knew a thing or two,\" muttered the spendthrift to himself. \"Can it be possible that he knows something of the past, and is going out to the wreck for a purpose?\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3023/83627.html","bookId":258,"book":{"id":258,"title":"Young Captain Jack","description":"简介： In its original shape Mr. Alger intended this tale of a soldier\u0027s son for a juvenile drama, and it is, therefore, full of dramatic situations.
