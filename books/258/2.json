{"id":7763,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER I. THE ENCOUNTER ON THE BRIDGE.","content":"\"Get out of the way, boy, or I\u0027ll ride over you!\" \n \n \"Wait a second, please, until I haul in this fish. He\u0027s such a beauty I don\u0027t wish to lose him.\" \n \n \"Do you suppose I\u0027m going to bother with your fish? Get out of the way, I say!\" And the man, who sat astride of a coal-black horse, shook his hand threateningly. He was dressed in the uniform of a surgeon in the Confederate Army, and his face was dark and crafty. \n \n The boy, who was but fourteen and rather slenderly built, looked up in surprise. He was seated on the side of a narrow bridge spanning a mountain stream flowing into the ocean, and near him rested a basket half-filled with fish. He had been on the point of hauling in another fish—of extra size—but now his prize gave a sudden flip and disappeared from view. \n \n \"Gone! and you made me miss him!\" he cried, much vexed. \n \n \"Shut up about your fish and get out of the way!\" stormed the man on the horse. \"Am I to be held up here all day by a mere boy?\" \n \n \"Excuse me, but I have as much right on this bridge as you,\" answered the boy, looking the man straight in the eyes. \n \n \"Have you indeed?\" \n \n \"I have.\" \n \n \"Perhaps you think yourself of just as much importance as a surgeon in the army, on an important mission.\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t say that. I said I had just as much right on this bridge as you. It\u0027s a public bridge.\" \n \n \"Bah! get out of the way and let me pass. I\u0027ve wasted time enough on you.\" The man tugged nervously at his heavy mustache. \"Which is the way to Tanner\u0027s Mill?\" \n \n To this the youth made no reply. Gathering up his fishing rod and his basket, he stepped to the river bank and prepared to make another cast into the water. \n \n \"I say, tell me the way to Tanner\u0027s Mill,\" repeated the man. \n \n \"I reckon you had better go elsewhere for your information,\" returned the boy quietly, but with a faint smile playing over his handsome, sunburned face. \n \n \"What, you young rascal, you won\u0027t tell me?\" stormed the man. \n \n \"No, I won\u0027t. And I beg to let you know I am no rascal.\" \n \n \"You are a rascal,\" was the snappy reply. \"Answer my question, or it will be the worse for you,\" and now the man leaped to the ground and advanced with clenched fists. Possibly he thought the youth would retreat; if so, he was mistaken. \n \n \"Don\u0027t you dare to touch me, sir. I am not your slave.\" \n \n \"You\u0027ll answer my question.\" \n \n \"I will not.\" \n \n \"Why not?\" \n \n \"Because you haven\u0027t treated me decently; that\u0027s why.\" \n \n \"You hold a mighty big opinion of yourself.\" \n \n \"If I do, that\u0027s my own business.\" \n \n \"Perhaps you are a Northern mudsill.\" \n \n \"No, I am just as loyal to the South as you or anybody.\" \n \n \"I wouldn\u0027t care to take your word on that point, youngster. I am on an important mission, and if you sympathize with our South in this great war you\u0027ll direct me to the short way to Tanner\u0027s Mill.\" \n \n \"Do they expect a fight at Tanner\u0027s Mill?\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t bother me with questions. Show me the road, and I\u0027ll be off.\" \n \n \"Keep to the right and you\u0027ll be right,\" answered the youth, after a pause, and then he resumed his fishing. \n \n The man scowled darkly as he leaped again into the saddle. \"How I would love to warm you—if I had time,\" he muttered, then put spurs to his steed and galloped off. \n \n \"So he is going to Tanner\u0027s Mill,\" mused the boy, when left alone. \"If they have a fight there it will be getting pretty close to home. I don\u0027t believe mother will like that.\" \n \n As will be surmised from the scene just described, Jack Ruthven was a manly, self-reliant boy, not easily intimidated by those who would browbeat him. \n \n He lived in a large mansion, set back some distance from the river, upon what was considered at that time one of the richest plantations in South Carolina. \n \n Mrs. Ruthven was a widow, having lost her husband, Colonel Martin Ruthven, at the bloody battle of Gettysburg. She had one daughter, Marion, a beautiful young lady of seventeen. Marion and Jack thought the world of each other and were all but inseparable. \n \n The sudden taking-off of the colonel had proved a great shock both to the children and to Mrs. Ruthven, and for a long time the lady of the house had lain on a bed of sickness, in consequence. \n \n She was now around, but still weak and pale. Her one consolation was the children, and she clung to them closer than ever. \n \n On several occasions Jack had spoken of enlisting as a drummer boy, but Mrs. Ruthven would not listen to it. \n \n \"No, no, Jack! I cannot spare you!\" had been her words. \"One gone out of the family is enough.\" \n \n And Marion, too, had clung to him, so that going away became almost an impossibility, although he longed for the glories of a soldier\u0027s life, with never a thought of all the hardships and sufferings such a life entails. \n \n The meeting with the Confederate surgeon had filled Jack\u0027s head once more with visions of army life, and as he continued to fish he forgot all about the unpleasant encounter, although he remembered that repulsive face well. He was destined to meet the surgeon again, and under most disagreeable circumstances. \n \n \"I wish mother would let me join the army,\" he thought, after hauling in another fish. \"I am sure our regiments need all the men they can get. Somehow, we seem to be getting the worst of the fighting lately. I wonder what would happen if the South should be beaten in this struggle?\" \n \n Ten minutes passed, when a merry whistle was heard on the road and another boy appeared, of about Jack\u0027s age. \n \n \"Hullo, Darcy!\" cried Jack. \"Come to help me fish?\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t know you were fishing,\" answered Darcy Gilbert, a youth who lived on the plantation next to Jack. \"Are you having good luck?\" \n \n \"First-rate. I was getting ready to go home, but now you have come I\u0027ll stay a while longer.\" \n \n \"Do, Jack; I hate to fish alone. But I say, Jack——\" And then Darcy broke off short. \n \n \"What were you going to say?\" \n \n \"Oh, nothing!\" \n \n There was a minute of silence, during which Darcy baited his hook and threw it in. \n \n \"You look as if you had something on your mind. Darcy,\" went on Jack, after his friend had brought in a fine haul apparently without appreciating the sport. \"Did you meet a Confederate surgeon on the road?\" \n \n \"No, I came across the plantation. What of him?\" \n \n \"He came this way, and we got into a regular row because I wouldn\u0027t clear right out and give him the whole of the bridge.\" \n \n \"He didn\u0027t hit you, did he?\" \n \n \"Not much! If he had I would have pitched into him, I can tell you, big as he was!\" And Jack\u0027s eyes flashed in a way that proved he meant what he said. \n \n \"No, I didn\u0027t meet him, but I met St. John Ruthven, your cousin. Jack, do you know that that young man is a regular bully, even if he is a dandy?\" \n \n \"Yes, I know it, Darcy.\" \n \n \"And he is down on you.\" \n \n \"I know that too. But why he dislikes me I don\u0027t know, excepting that I don\u0027t like to see him paying his addresses to my sister Marion. Marion is too good for such a man.\" \n \n \"Is he paying his addresses to her?\" \n \n \"Well, he is with her every chance he can get.\" \n \n \"Does Marion like him?\" \n \n \"Oh! I reckon she does in a way. He is always so nice to her—much nicer than he has ever been to me.\" \n \n \"Has he ever spoken to you about yourself?\" went on Darcy Gilbert, with a peculiar look at Jack. \n \n \"Oh, yes! often.\" \n \n \"I mean about—well, about your past?\" went on Darcy, with some confusion. \n \n \"My past, Darcy? What is wrong about my past?\" \n \n \"Nothing, I hope. But I didn\u0027t like what St. John Ruthven said about you.\" \n \n \"But what did he say?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know as I ought to tell you. I didn\u0027t believe him.\" \n \n \"But I want to know what he did say?\" demanded Jack, throwing down his fishing pole and coming up close to his friend. \n \n \"Well, if you must know, Jack, he said you were a nobody, that you didn\u0027t belong to the Ruthven family at all, and that you would have to go away some day,\" was the answer, which filled Jack with consternation. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3023/83619.html","bookId":258,"book":{"id":258,"title":"Young Captain Jack","description":"简介： In its original shape Mr. Alger intended this tale of a soldier\u0027s son for a juvenile drama, and it is, therefore, full of dramatic situations.
