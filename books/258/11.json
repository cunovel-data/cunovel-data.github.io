{"id":7772,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER X. THE PAPERS ON THE WRECK.","content":"As the waters of the bay were quiet, it did not take Ben long to row Dr. Mackey over to the wreck on the rocks. \n \n \"Be careful how you steps out, sah,\" said the colored man. \"De rocks am slippery, an\u0027 you kin twist an ankle widout half tryin\u0027, sah.\" \n \n \"I will be careful, Ben. So this is the wreck?\" \n \n \"Yes, sah.\" \n \n \"I presume all that was movable in the ship has been carried off?\" \n \n \"Long ago, sah.\" \n \n \"But the inside of the ship itself was not torn out?\" \n \n \"No, sah. De folks around yeah is too afraid ob ghosteses fo\u0027 dat.\" \n \n \"Ah, yes! so I heard—at least, I would suppose so,\" replied the doctor, in some confusion. \"By the way, you need not remain here. I will visit the wreck alone. You can come back in an hour or so.\" \n \n \"Wery well, massah.\" \n \n \"But don\u0027t forget to come back. I don\u0027t want to be left here all night.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t worry, sah; I\u0027ll be back fo\u0027 dat dollah, sah,\" and Ben grinned. \n \n \"Oh, yes! I forgot about the dollar. Well, you shall have it when you take me back to shore.\" \n \n The doctor walked slowly toward the wreck, glancing back several times to see if Old Ben was following him. \n \n The colored man rowed away in a thoughtful mood. \n \n \"Somet\u0027ing is on dat man\u0027s mind, suah!\" he muttered to himself. \"He\u0027s gwine ter do somet\u0027ing.\" \n \n With difficulty the surgeon climbed up to the deck of the wreck. A desolate spectacle presented itself. Everything was charred by the fire. \n \n \"Truly a nice place to come to,\" said the man to himself. \"Now, supposing this thing turns out a wild-goose chase, after all? Let me see, the stateroom was No. 15. I wonder if I can still locate it?\" \n \n With caution he descended the companion way and entered the main cabin of the stranded vessel. Here he drew from his pocket a candle and lit it. \n \n He walked slowly toward the side of the cabin until he reached a stateroom bearing the number 7 upon the door. \n \n \"Seven,\" he murmured. \"And the second from this is eleven. That shows the numbers on this side are all odd. The next must be thirteen, and the next fifteen.\" \n \n He held the candle to the door, but the number plate was gone. Without hesitation he pushed upon the door, which was already partly open. It fell back, exposing the interior of the stateroom, now bare of all things movable, and covered with dust and cobwebs. \n \n \"A dirty job this,\" he murmured, and set the candle down upon a beam running along the side of a wall. He gazed around the stateroom curiously, as if hardly knowing what to do next. \n \n \"The little closet was set in the wall at the foot of the bed. Now which was the foot of the bed? I\u0027ll try both ends.\" He did so, tapping on the woodwork with his knuckles. Presently he found a hole where there had once been a small knob. \n \n \"The closet, sure enough!\" he cried, and his face took on a new interest. \"Now where is that door-knob?\" \n \n He hunted on the floor, but no knob came to view. But a bent nail was handy, and this he inserted into the hole sideways, and pulled with all his force. There was a slight creak, and a small door came open, revealing a dark closet about a foot square and equally deep. \n \n If the room was dirty the closet was more so, for a crack at the top had let in both dirt and water, and at first he could see nothing but a solid cake of dirt before him. Digging into this, he presently uncovered a heavy tin box, painted black. \n \n \"Eureka! the box at last!\" he cried, in a tone full of pleasure. \"I am the lucky one, after all!\" \n \n He brought the tin box forth and brushed it off. There was a little padlock in front, and this was locked. Bringing a bunch of keys from his pocket, he began to try them, one after another. At last he found one to fit, and opened the box. \n \n \"The papers at last!\" he murmured, and his eyes gleamed with expectation. \"Let me see what there is.\" He turned them over. \"The marriage certificate for one, and letters from his father about that property. And other letters from her folks—all here, and just what I wanted.\" He shoved the documents back into the box. \"The fortune is mine!\" \n \n Returning to the closet he cleaned it out thoroughly, to learn if it contained anything more of value. But there was nothing more there, and presently he blew out the candle, hid the tin box under his coat, and returned to the deck. \n \n Ben was rowing not far away and saw the doctor wave his hand. \n \n \"Is yo\u0027 ready, massah?\" he called out. \n \n \"Yes, Ben.\" \n \n The colored man said no more, but rowed inshore, and in the meantime the doctor hurried down to meet him. \n \n \"Did you find any gold, massah?\" asked the colored man, his white teeth gleaming. \n \n \"Gold! Why, you foolish nigger, what chance is there of finding gold on a wreck over ten years old? The best thing you can do is to break the boat to pieces and take the wood ashore for fuel.\" \n \n \"But de ghosteses, massah! Besides, Mrs. Ruthven wouldn\u0027t let us touch dat wrack nohow.\" \n \n \"On account of the boy, I suppose.\" \n \n \"Yes, massah.\" \n \n \"To tell the truth, my man, I have now as much interest in that ship as has that boy or Mrs. Ruthven. It brings back an exciting passage in my life. My visit to the wreck was made to satisfy me concerning several important questions. I was one of the passengers on that ill-fated ship!\" \n \n \"Golly, massah, yo\u0027 don\u0027t really mean dat?\" And Old Ben\u0027s eyes opened widely. \n \n \"Yes, I do. I suspected it before; now I am dead certain of it.\" \n \n At this declaration Old Ben grew quite excited. \n \n \"And did yo\u0027 know Massah Jack\u0027s fadder, sah?\" \n \n \"Yes, my man, I knew him very well,\" and there was a significant smile on the doctor\u0027s face as he spoke. \n \n \"And was he a gen\u0027man, sah? St. John Ruthven t\u0027inks he was common white trash.\" \n \n \"He was a gentleman of high family—the son of an English nobleman, although born in this country.\" \n \n \"An\u0027 Jack\u0027s mudder, sah?\" \n \n \"Was an American lady—a lady belonging to one of the first families of Massachusetts.\" \n \n \"Golly, a Northerner!\" and Ben\u0027s face became a study. \n \n \"Yes.\" \n \n \"Yo\u0027 must visit de house, sah, and tell Mrs. Ruthven \u0027bout dis. She will want to heah de partic\u0027lars wery much, sah.\" \n \n \"Yes, I will visit the Ruthven home,\" replied the doctor. \n \n \"Yo\u0027 know de way, sah?\" \n \n \"I believe I do.\" \n \n \"I can show yo\u0027 de way, an\u0027 will do it willingly. So you knew Jack\u0027s fadder an\u0027 mudder! Golly, but aint dat strange—after all dese yeahs, too! Jack will want to see yo\u0027, ob course.\" \n \n \"And I shall want to see Jack,\" replied the medical man. \n \n \"Jack\u0027s a fine lad, sah.\" \n \n \"I am glad to hear it.\" But, as he spoke, the face of Dr. Mackey became a study. \n \n \"Yes, sah; aint no bettah boy in all dese parts, sah.\" \n \n While talking Ben was rowing steadily, and it was not long before the pair reached shore. \n \n Then the boat was made fast, the oars put away, and the doctor and the colored man started for the Ruthven mansion. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3023/83628.html","bookId":258,"book":{"id":258,"title":"Young Captain Jack","description":"简介： In its original shape Mr. Alger intended this tale of a soldier\u0027s son for a juvenile drama, and it is, therefore, full of dramatic situations.
