{"id":7775,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. DR. MACKEY TELLS HIS STORY.","content":"Left to herself, Mrs. Ruthven grew restless and began to walk around the garden, examining the flower beds and the shrubbery. \n \n She did not like what St. John had had to say concerning Marion. While she did not exactly fear the young man, yet she had heard several reports which were not to his credit. \n \n \"They say he gambles on horse races,\" she thought. \"And I have heard that the plantation is heavily mortgaged. Perhaps he wishes to marry Marion only for the money she may bring him. And then it is not right for him to remain around here when other men are at the front, serving their country\u0027s flag.\" \n \n She remained in the garden for some time, and was on the point of moving for the house when she saw Old Ben approaching with Dr. Mackey. \n \n \"A stranger—and dressed in the uniform of a Confederate,\" she said, half aloud. \"What can he wish here?\" \n \n \"Good-afternoon, missus,\" said Old Ben, removing his hat. \"Here am a gen\u0027man as wishes to see yo\u0027,\" and he bowed low. \n \n \"To see me?\" said Mrs. Ruthven. \n \n \"Yes, madam,\" replied the doctor. \"Permit me to introduce myself. I am Dr. Mackey, a surgeon attached to the Fifth Virginia regiment,\" and he bowed gravely. \n \n \"I am happy to make the acquaintance of an officer in our army, sir,\" replied Mrs. Ruthven, and held out her hand. \n \n \"I understand the late Colonel Ruthven was also of our army, and died at a gallant charge on the field of Gettysburg,\" continued the doctor, as he shook hands. \n \n \"You have been correctly informed, doctor.\" \n \n \"De doctor brings most important information, missus,\" put in old Ben, who was almost exploding to tell what he knew. \n \n \"Is that so?\" cried Mrs. Ruthven. \"What is it?\" \n \n \"I came to speak to you about yonder wreck on Hemlock Bluff rocks,\" said the surgeon. \"The sight of that wreck has taken me back to the affairs of about eleven years ago.\" \n \n \"So you were—you knew of it at that time, sir?\" \n \n \"Yes, I was one of the passengers on the ship, madam.\" \n \n \"A passenger! I thought all of the passengers were drowned,—I mean all but those who came ashore here.\" \n \n \"I was not drowned. I was swept overboard before our ship came into the bay, and clung to a spar for hours, until the storm abated. Then a ship bound for Cuba came along and took me on board and carried me to Havana. The shock and the exposure were too much for me, and when I recovered physically the authorities at the hospital adjudged me insane, and I was placed in an asylum for years. Slowly my reason returned to me, and at last I left the island of Cuba and came to the Southern States. This was shortly after the war had broken out, and, knowing nothing else to do, I offered my services to General Lee, and was accepted and placed in the hospital corps.\" \n \n \"But why did you not come here before?\" \n \n \"I could not tell exactly where the ship had stranded, and did not hear of the wreck on Hemlock Bluff rocks until about three weeks ago. Then I determined to make an investigation. I have now visited the wreck and have learned positively that it is that of the ship upon which myself, my wife, and our little son took passage.\" \n \n \"Yourself, your wife, and your little son,\" repeated Mrs. Ruthven, and then of a sudden her breast began to heave. \"Your wife and son were with you?\" \n \n \"Yes, madam.\" \n \n \"Wha—what was your little son\u0027s name?\" she faltered, hardly able to go on. \n \n \"Jack.\" \n \n \"By golly, he must be our Jack\u0027s fadder!\" burst out Old Ben. \"Now don\u0027t dat beat de nation!\" \n \n \"Jack! No! no! You—you cannot be our Jack\u0027s father!\" cried Mrs. Ruthven. \n \n \"I understand you are very much attached to the boy,\" went on Dr. Mackey smoothly. \"It is a pity. Yes, he is truly my son.\" \n \n The tears came into Mrs. Ruthven\u0027s eyes, but she hastily brushed them away. \"Jack does not look much like you,\" she declared. \n \n \"That is true, but he bears a strong resemblance to my dead brother Walter, and that is what made me certain he is my son. I saw him in town a day or two ago, although he did not see me.\" \n \n \"This is very strange.\" The lady hardly knew how to go on. The thought that she might have to give up Jack was a bitter one. \"Have you spoken to Jack yet?\" \n \n \"No. Isn\u0027t he here?\" \n \n \"No, he went for a boat race, against his cousin, St. John Ruthven—I mean my nephew,\" she stammered. \n \n \"Do you expect him back soon?\" \n \n \"I do not believe he will be gone more than an hour or so.\" \n \n \"Then I will wait.\" \n \n \"Of course, Dr. Mackey. Will you come into the house?\" \n \n The surgeon was willing, and the lady led the way. But presently she turned back to beckon to Old Ben. \n \n \"Go after Jack at once,\" she said. \"Tell him it is important, but do not say anything more to anybody.\" Ben nodded, and without further delay strode off. \n \n \"I have heard something of how the wreck struck here and how my poor wife was cast ashore with Jack in her arms,\" said the doctor, as he threw himself into an easy-chair. \"I should be very much gratified to receive the particulars from your lips. Did my wife have anything to say?\" \n \n \"Nothing much, sir. She was delirious up to the moment of her death.\" \n \n \"Poor, dear Julia!\" murmured the surgeon, and bringing out his handkerchief, he wiped his eyes with much affectation. \n \n \"Was her name Julia?\" asked Mrs. Ruthven curiously. \n \n \"Yes, madam.\" The doctor looked up suddenly. \"What makes you ask?\" \n \n \"It ran in my mind that before your wife died she murmured something about her name being Laura.\" \n \n \"Poor dear! she was truly out of her mind,\" replied the surgeon. \"But it is not to be wondered at—considering what happened to me.\" And he proceeded to make use of his handkerchief again. \n \n Mrs. Ruthven sank into a chair and gave herself up to bitter reflection. What if this man should take Jack from her? The plantation would seem very lonely without him. \n \n Voices were now heard in the garden, and looking out of the window the lady of the house saw Jack approaching, accompanied by Marion and Old Ben. St. John had taken himself off, in order to get home and exchange his wet clothing for dry garments. \n \n \"Oh, Jack! what does this mean?\" cried Mrs. Ruthven when she saw that our hero was dripping wet. \n \n \"He saved St. John\u0027s life, mamma,\" exclaimed Marion. \n \n \"Saved St. John\u0027s life?\" \n \n \"Yes. St. John\u0027s boat struck on the rocks, and he went overboard. The current was strong, and he would have been swept away only Jack leaped overboard and went to his assistance.\" \n \n \"You noble boy!\" murmured Mrs. Ruthven, and as he came in, by way of one of the long veranda windows, she caught him by both hands. \n \n \"Old Ben said you wished to see me,\" replied Jack, and then he caught sight of Dr. Mackey and his face fell. \"The man I had the row with,\" he thought. \n \n \"Jack, this is Dr. Mackey,\" said Mrs. Ruthven, in strained tones. \"He—he came here to see you.\" She could get no further. \n \n \"To see me? What for?\" \n \n \"My boy, I am pleased to meet you,\" said the doctor, rising and extending his hand. And he then added in a lower voice, \"How like Walter! How very like Walter!\" \n \n \"I—I don\u0027t understand you,\" stammered Jack. \"What do you want of me?\" \n \n \"My boy, you are thinking of that encounter we had on the bridge. Let us both forget it. I came here on a most important mission. Jack, I am your father!\" \n \n \"My father?\" And our hero leaped back in astonishment. \n \n \"Yes, my son, I am your father.\" Dr. Mackey caught our hero by the hand. \"No doubt the news seems strange to you. Nevertheless, it is true.\" \n \n Jack hardly heard the latter words, for his head was in a swim. This crafty-looking, overbearing individual his parent? The shock was an awful one. He turned to his foster mother. \n \n \"Mother, is this true—is this man my real father?\" he cried beseechingly. \n \n \"So he claims,\" returned Mrs. Ruthven. \n \n \"My dear, dear son, I trust you do not disbelieve me,\" said the doctor, in an apparently hurt tone of voice. \n \n \"I—I don\u0027t know what to say,\" faltered Jack. \"This is so strange—so unexpected. Why didn\u0027t you come here before?\" \n \n \"I have just been telling Mrs. Ruthven my story,\" and the surgeon repeated what he had said, with several added details. As the man went on our hero\u0027s face grew very pale, and he moved slowly towards Mrs. Ruthven and clutched her by the shoulder. \n \n \"Mother, I don\u0027t want to leave you!\" he whispered hoarsely. \"I don\u0027t like this man, even if he is my father!\" \n \n \"I do not want you to leave me, Jack,\" she answered, embracing him in spite of the fact that he was dripping wet. \"But if this man is really your father——\" \n \n \"Make him prove it!\" \n \n \"You will not take his word?\" \n \n \"No! no! I do not like his looks. He is the man who met me on the bridge and treated me like a slave.\" \n \n Marion had listened to the conversation with a look of horror slowly rising on her face. Now she rushed toward Jack. \n \n \"Jack, can this be true, and must I give you up?\" she sobbed. \n \n \"No, I\u0027m not going to give you up, Marion. We have always been brother and sister, and so we shall remain—if you are willing.\" \n \n \"Yes, dear Jack; stay by all means.\" \n \n By this time Dr. Mackey had arisen to his feet, and now he came up to Jack with a darkening face. \n \n \"Did I understand you to say that you wished me to prove I was your father?\" he demanded harshly. \n \n \"Yes, I do wish you to prove it,\" answered Jack, with a boldness born of desperation. \"And until you prove it I shall remain here—if Mrs. Ruthven will let me.\" \n \n \"By golly, dat\u0027s de talk!\" came from Old Ben, who was hanging around on the veranda. \n \n \"Shut up, you worthless nigger!\" cried the doctor, at which Ben disappeared like magic. \n \n \"This is a very—ahem—a very strange way to treat a newly found father, Jack.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t acknowledge you as my father.\" \n \n \"Ha! you won\u0027t believe me?\" \n \n \"I will not, sir, and until you prove your claim in court I shall remain with the lady who has been a real mother to me,\" answered our hero pointedly and firmly. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3023/83631.html","bookId":258,"book":{"id":258,"title":"Young Captain Jack","description":"简介： In its original shape Mr. Alger intended this tale of a soldier\u0027s son for a juvenile drama, and it is, therefore, full of dramatic situations.
