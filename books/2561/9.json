{"id":112188,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"By the following Wednesday morning much of the initial novelty, trepidation, excitement and uncertainty surrounding the arrival of the aliens had disappeared. With a startling rapidity that I would never have predicted, daily life for the vast majority of the people living on the surface of our planet returned to its familiar humdrum pace. The relentless monotony and tedium about which most people complained (but which most people also secretly clung to) was back.\\n\\n At some ridiculously early hour (I think it was somewhere between half-seven and half-eight that morning) I found myself sitting in the passenger seat of James\u0027 beaten-up and rattling old car, being driven at speed along the rough dirt track which connected Porter Farm to the main Portland Road and, therefore, to the rest of the world. Porter Farm was a little secluded family business nestled deep within the hills just a few miles outside Thatcham. Once or twice a week I would spend some time there helping out Joe Porter who had been a close friend of Dad\u0027s for many years. I was relying on a lift because today, for some inexplicable reason, I had allowed Robert to borrow my car. Christ alone knows why I let him get away with it. I could never understand why he hadn\u0027t bought his own car and why he stayed at my house when we\u0027d both inherited exactly the same from Mum and Dad\u0027s estate. I suppose it was easier (and cheaper) for him to sponge off me when he needed to rather than dip into his own pocket unnecessarily. Today - for reasons best known to himself - he had decided to travel halfway across the country to see a couple of his friends from college. I didn\u0027t understand the need. Rob and his friends drank, studied, socialised and partied with each other almost all the year round, and yet they always seemed to want to meet up in the holidays too. More drinking, socialising and parties perhaps? Still, looking on the bright side Rob had only been back with me for just over a month and I was already sick of the sight of him. It did us both good to be away from each other for a while. The loss of my car for a day was a fair price to pay for a little peace and space.\\n\\n \u0027Why the bloody hell do you do this?\u0027 James asked suddenly, waking me from my early morning daydreams.\\n\\n \u0027Do what?\u0027 I mumbled, confused.\\n\\n \u0027You know,\u0027 he said, shouting to make himself heard over the throaty roar of his car\u0027s exhausted engine, \u0027work on a farm for nothing? Christ, if I had the chance to stop at home and do nothing like you could then I\u0027d do just that. You wouldn\u0027t catch me doing anything I didn\u0027t have to. And that tight bugger Porter doesn\u0027t even pay you!\u0027\\n\\n From the outside I guessed that his feelings were pretty understandable. My decision to give up my time voluntarily to work at the farm did seem out of character for someone who had recently jumped ship from the rat race. But there were reasons why I did it. Reasons that I usually chose not to share.\\n\\n \u0027I get bored sitting at home all day,\u0027 I said, hoping to throw James off the scent. It seemed to do the trick. He nodded thoughtfully and returned his full attention to the dusty road which stretched out in front of us.\\n\\n That answer was partly true, but it wasn\u0027t the only reason why I helped Joe out. He had been a close friend of Mum and Dad, and he\u0027d been the one who had broken the news of their accident to me. He\u0027d been the one who had driven me to the hospital and he\u0027d been the one who had picked up Rob from university and brought him home when it happened. I owed Joe Porter a lot. I had a debt of gratitude to him which I wanted to repay. On another level I knew that my dad would have been appalled if he\u0027d known I\u0027d left my job. It was something of a consolation to be doing something with my time that I thought he might approve of.\\n\\n There was another reason for working at the farm. It was much more simple and obvious. The fact of the matter was that I couldn\u0027t stand spending all that time on my own. Siobhan worked long hours and Rob was usually away at university. I had other friends, but they worked too and were not often about during the day time. It wasn\u0027t so much the boredom that bothered me, instead it was the danger of having too much time to think. I had pretty much come to terms with losing Mum and Dad (well, as much as anyone ever can come to terms with such a loss) but there were moments when the strong facade I put up crumbled and fell. It was often when I was doing the most ridiculously mundane and uninteresting thing - mowing the lawn or washing up or cooking for example. Sometimes just hearing their names or seeing their faces in photographs on the walls would do it. A crack would appear that would quickly become wider and wider until it was more like a gaping chasm. Then it was only a matter of time before the floodgates opened and a tidal wave of grief washed over me. I always felt better again eventually. But whenever the pain begins it feels like it will never go away.\\n\\n \u0027The atmosphere\u0027s bad at work at the moment,\u0027 James sighed. \u0027When isn\u0027t it bad?\u0027 I replied, not in the slightest bit interested. I had hoped that we might get through the journey without having to hear about the office but no such luck. If I\u0027d turned to my right and smacked James in the face he wouldn\u0027t have stopped. He was on autopilot - a pre-programmed routine of moaning and whining. I\u0027d sat through this far too many times before, and I guessed that before long I\u0027d have to sit through it again.\\n\\n \u0027I tell you,\u0027 he continued, \u0027it\u0027s pretty desperate right now. I know things were bad when you were there but Christ, I\u0027ve never known it like it is at the moment.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what\u0027s happened now?\u0027 I heard myself ask. I hadn\u0027t really wanted to know, but some stupid subconscious reaction inside me made me speak. What a bloody idiot. When would I learn to shut up?\\n\\n \u0027Remember Simon?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The bloke with the red Jaguar?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, that\u0027s Marcus Phillips. Simon\u0027s got an old Rover.\u0027\\n\\n I thought carefully for less than half a second. I couldn\u0027t remember ever working with anyone called Simon but I knew that would be inconsequential. James would continue with his tales of woe whatever.\\n\\n \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 I lied, trying to speed things up, \u0027I remember.\u0027\\n\\n James paused for a second to concentrate as he steered the car around a deep pothole in the track.\\n\\n \u0027Middle of last week, one of the new juniors we\u0027ve got asked him to check over an order he\u0027d put up. Now Simon\u0027s just like the rest of us, his desk\u0027s piled high with crap and he didn\u0027t check the order properly. Turned out it was an urgent order for E S Carters and they only got half of what they wanted. They\u0027d had problems before apparently. Upshot of this one was that they closed their account. And they were worth a fucking fortune...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But if you don\u0027t give the customer what they want then...\u0027\\n\\n James ignored me.\\n\\n \u0027Worst of it was though, because Simon\u0027s signature was on the dispatch note, he\u0027s the one who\u0027s taking the rap for us losing the business. He\u0027s up on disciplinary for it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Really?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Really.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And was it his fault?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n James thought for a moment.\\n\\n \u0027Suppose it was. I mean, the junior should have...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tough shit then, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 I said, successfully and abruptly ending the conversation for a couple of seconds.\\n\\n Less than a minute later it started again.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027ve downgraded him,\u0027 James said. \u0027Who?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Simon. They\u0027ve downgraded him. And they\u0027ve transferred someone in from another department to do his job. Then they had the nerve to turn around and ask him to train the new bloke up!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So has he done it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, he told them to piss off.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And what did they do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They suspended him. Now we\u0027ve got some bloody graduate in there until Simon\u0027s back or he\u0027s given the boot. It\u0027s all wrong, you know. There are four of us sitting there who could do the job with our eyes closed but instead of paying one of us a little deputising they bring in this fucking high-flyer who doesn\u0027t know his arse from his elbow.\u0027\\n\\n I smiled to myself. As James became angrier so his language became worse.\\n\\n \u0027Just grin and bear it like you always do,\u0027 I sighed. James nodded. I sympathised with him to an extent, but James was one of those people who was always happy enough to moan but never willing to do anything about the problem. He\u0027d quickly enough point out what was wrong, but never look for a solution. At that precise moment in time the only emotion I felt was sweet relief that I had managed to leave behind the desperate and dirty world of back-stabbing and seedy office politics. No matter how bad things got I could never imagine going back there.\\n\\n \u0027How\u0027s the baby?\u0027 I asked with my voice full of blatantly false enthusiasm. The parents of young children had, in my experience, a devastating ability to bore. But these were desperate times, and desperate times called for desperate measures. I knew that if I wanted to avoid more soul-destroying stories about overtime, shipping orders and in-trays then I would have to suffer a string of humourless anecdotes about the varied colours of the contents of James\u0027 baby\u0027s nappy instead.\\n\\n \u0027Fine,\u0027 he smiled, suitably distracted. \u0027She\u0027s fine. Doing really well.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Glad to hear it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I just wish I could spend more time at home.\u0027\\n\\n Here we go again, I thought.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sure you do,\u0027 I sympathised.\\n\\n \u0027If I could resign tomorrow then I\u0027d do it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why don\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n As James struggled to answer me we finally arrived (thankfully) at the entrance to Porter Farm. I had my seat belt off and the door half-open before he\u0027d even stopped the car.\\n\\n \u0027You okay for a lift back tonight?\u0027 he asked.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 I replied. \u0027But don\u0027t worry about it. I can walk or get a lift back from Joe.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve got my mobile number in case you get stuck?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got it.\u0027 James looked up at me and then slowly shook his head from side to side.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the problem?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n He shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\n \u0027Nothing,\u0027 he sighed. \u0027I just can\u0027t get my head round the fact that you\u0027d rather be here than sitting at home with your feet up. You could be there in front of the telly with a cool can of beer in your hand...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not even nine o\u0027clock yet...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know what I mean,\u0027 he scowled.\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n \u0027I know what you mean. You\u0027d understand if you were in my shoes,\u0027 I assured him.\\n\\n \u0027I doubt it,\u0027 he grumbled. \u0027I\u0027d like to have the chance, mind you. Hey, if you ever feel like swapping places for a few days then give me a shout and...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just think about it for a minute...\u0027 he joked.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 I said again.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know, when I look at those bloody aliens...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about them?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, they\u0027re bloody stupid, aren\u0027t they?\u0027\\n\\n Stupid was the last thing the aliens seemed to be.\\n\\n \u0027What makes you say that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just look at them. They\u0027ve come half way across the galaxy to get here and now they can\u0027t get back.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So, they\u0027re working. Imagine leaving your home for months on end to go to work? It\u0027s bad enough just being out for the day. And I wouldn\u0027t even go to the end of our street for my lot!\u0027\\n\\n I laughed and shut the door. James turned the car around in the dusty farm yard and stopped when he was level with me.\\n\\n \u0027Thanks for the lift. I\u0027ll give you a call.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027See you at the pub on Friday?\u0027\\n\\n I knew that I had to make an effort to try and stay away from the pub but he\u0027d put me on the spot.\\n\\n \u0027Probably,\u0027 I said, being deliberately noncommittal.\\n\\n \u0027See you there,\u0027 he smiled, knowing full well that I wouldn\u0027t be able to resist the temptation of a pre-weekend drink.\\n\\n James drove away and I watched him disappear before turning and walking towards the farm house. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-9.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
