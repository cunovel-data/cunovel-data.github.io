{"id":112186,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Just after four o\u0027clock that afternoon the telephone rang. It was Clare Austin, another one of the few close friends that I had made at the office where I used to work who I bothered to keep in touch with and who bothered to keep in touch with me. She made me laugh. In spite of all that had happened in the last twenty-four hours, Clare sounded as down-to-earth as ever. She was the one person I\u0027d spoken to who seemed still firmly anchored to the harsh realities of everyday life and who was unfazed and unconcerned by the alien arrival to the point of ignorance.\n Now that I had been freed from the shackles of a regular job and a daily routine, my life had changed and I frequently found myself doing things which, a year ago, I wouldn\u0027t even have considered. When it came to Clare I had become a janitor of sorts. She lived alone with her daughter, Penny and I often helped her out by doing odd-jobs around her home for her. I\u0027d change a plug, cut the hedge, fix a lock or, as she\u0027d asked me this afternoon, put up a shelf. It wasn\u0027t that she couldn\u0027t do it, it was more just an excuse for us to get together. Today I welcomed the interruption. Sitting at home in front of the television I had nothing much to do except try and get over my lingering hangover. A visit to Clare\u0027s house would, I hoped, bring some life and purpose into a strange day that was badly in need of a kick-start.\n After taking the call from Clare and getting my tools together I was out of the house in minutes. It was a bright, warm and pleasant late-summer day and I drove slowly along the part of the main street which ran parallel to the grey stone sea wall. Countless holiday makers drifted aimlessly across the road in front of me, dragging behind them their bucket-and-spade carrying, ice-cream licking kids. Although they were a pain in the backside to the locals throughout the summer months, the tourists contributed so much to the economy of the village that Thatcham would struggle to survive without them. They were a nuisance that we had to bear.\n Today felt somehow different to most other days. There was a light and happy, almost carnival atmosphere in town and it felt more like the start of the summer season than the end. Everything felt almost, but not quite, normal and it was only when I glanced to my left and looked out over the sea wall that thoughts of yesterday\u0027s bizarre encounter returned. The ocean was calm, cool, deep, blue-grey and as reassuringly familiar as ever and yet, somewhere out there, an immense alien ship was hovering over the water. The road slowly curved away to the right and entered the centre of the village proper and I concentrated on driving again.\n Clare\u0027s house was only a few miles away and I was there in no time. I knocked at the door and it was quickly answered by Penny. Her mum appeared in the hallway behind her.\n \u0027Hello,\u0027 I smiled. \u0027All right?\u0027\n Clare nodded and walked towards me.\n \u0027You were quick,\u0027 she said.\n I went into the house and pulled the door closed behind me.\n \u0027I know. I had nothing else to do so I thought that...\u0027\n \u0027Haven\u0027t you got a life anymore?\u0027 she laughed, interrupting me. \u0027It\u0027s a sad state of affairs when all you\u0027ve got to do on a Saturday afternoon is come round here and put shelves up for me!\u0027\n \u0027Siobhan\u0027s at work and Rob\u0027s still half-drunk from last night,\u0027 I explained.\n Clare said nothing. She just shook her head and walked towards the kitchen.\n Penny hovered at my side. I looked down and she flashed a toothy smile back at me.\n \u0027How are you, mate?\u0027 I asked, ruffling her already untidy hair.\n \u0027All right,\u0027 she mumbled before turning and running away from me as quickly as she could. I didn\u0027t take it personally. She was often awkward and embarrassed for the first few minutes whenever I visited. Once she\u0027d got used to me being around I couldn\u0027t get rid of her.\n I followed Clare deeper into the house.\n \u0027Want a drink?\u0027 she asked. I stood in the kitchen doorway and watched her.\n \u0027Something cold, please,\u0027 I replied.\n \u0027Juice or a beer?\u0027\n \u0027Juice.\u0027\n Clare glanced across at me and then took a glass from the draining board and poured my drink. She looked tired but relaxed, a million miles from the smartly-dressed professional career-minded woman I\u0027d first worked with at the office. Although we had worked well together from day one, it was only recently (since I\u0027d actually left work) that our friendship had blossomed. She and James were the only two people from the company that I\u0027d bothered to keep in touch with since leaving. Coincidentally, they were the only two people who had bothered to keep in touch with me.\n I took my drink from Clare and followed her into the living room.\n \u0027How\u0027s work?\u0027 I asked for no real reason as I sat down on the sofa.\n She looked at me with an expression that spoke volumes. She knew that I wasn\u0027t really interested and that I had asked more out of courtesy than for any other reason.\n \u0027Shit,\u0027 she replied bluntly. \u0027Remember how it was when you left?\u0027 I nodded. \u0027Well it\u0027s worse now. A damn site worse.\u0027\n I said nothing. For a few long seconds I remembered my time at the office and then immediately did my best to blank them from my mind. The months and years that I had spent there had without doubt been the most unrewarding period of my life so far.\n Penny distracted me from my daydreams by slamming the door of a nearby cabinet shut. She stomped heavily across the room (with all the grace of someone fifty times her weight) and slammed a video cassette into the machine beneath the television. She sat cross-legged in front of the screen and waited impatiently for her film to start.\n \u0027So how are you two getting on?\u0027 I asked.\n Clare was sitting on the arm at the other end of the sofa to me. She sighed and shrugged her shoulders and I noticed that her face had dropped slightly. She was obviously trying to keep her change in expression hidden from me but it wasn\u0027t working.\n \u0027We\u0027re okay,\u0027 she replied softly.\n \u0027Sure?\u0027 I pressed. I knew her well enough to be able to risk probing a little further. She shrugged her shoulders again.\n \u0027Honestly, we\u0027re fine.\u0027\n I wasn\u0027t convinced, but I could tell that she didn\u0027t want to talk. Times had been tough for Clare recently and I knew that she would confide in me if and when she needed to. Until then I knew that I should just back-off and give her space. Upsetting or offending my friend was the last thing I wanted to do and I didn\u0027t want her to misread my intentions. She was in the middle of a messy divorce from her husband and it didn\u0027t take much to upset her at the moment. He had walked out on her just before last Christmas and although he continued to support Penny financially, he had no other interest in the daughter he had abandoned. Sitting there watching her sitting in front of the TV I found it hard to believe that anyone could be so hard and callous. A perfect, innocent and helpless little girl whose life had been turned upside down by the adults she had trusted more than anyone else in the world. Clare\u0027s husband had casually announced that he was leaving over dinner. As they had eaten their evening meal together one night he had told her that he\u0027d met someone else and that he was leaving. And that was it. By the morning he had gone with no explanation and no more discussion. He\u0027d left without looking back.\n I was conscious that there was suddenly a heavy, almost oppressive silence in the room.\n \u0027Shall I show you where I want the shelf?\u0027 Clare asked.\n I nodded and got up to fetch my tools from the car.\n The shelf (which was in Penny\u0027s room) took less than half an hour to put up. The job had been so quick and easy that I\u0027d even had time to sand down the woodwork and give it a coat of varnish. Once I\u0027d finished and tidied up I went outside to the back garden where Penny was playing and Clare was relaxing in the warm orange rays of the late afternoon sun.\n \u0027All done,\u0027 I announced as I stepped out of the shadows of the house and into the sunlight.\n \u0027Brilliant,\u0027 Clare said, shielding her eyes.\n \u0027You\u0027ll need to give it another coat of varnish in a couple of hours. I\u0027ve slapped some on but...\u0027\n \u0027Do I owe you anything? Did you have to buy anything to...\u0027\n I shook my head.\n \u0027Don\u0027t be stupid,\u0027 I sighed. \u0027It was a pleasure. And anyway, you wouldn\u0027t be able to afford me if I charged!\u0027\n \u0027Cheeky sod!\u0027 she snapped, hurling a discarded teddy bear at me. \u0027I feel terrible though, you\u0027ve given up your Saturday afternoon and...\u0027\n \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter,\u0027 I interrupted. \u0027Saturday afternoons are the same as Monday afternoons these days. There\u0027s no difference to me anymore.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, but...\u0027\n \u0027But nothing,\u0027 I insisted. \u0027I really don\u0027t mind. But if you\u0027re insisting on giving me something for my trouble then make it another drink will you?\u0027\n Clare smiled and brushed past me as she disappeared into the house.\n Back in the cool of the living room I found myself drawn to the incredible pictures that were still being broadcast from out over the ocean. Penny\u0027s half-watched video had finished and the tape had automatically stopped, rewound and ejected itself from the player.\n \u0027So what do you think about all of this?\u0027 I asked Clare as she passed me my drink and sat down.\n \u0027Not a lot,\u0027 she replied abruptly. It was clear that her nonchalance was honest and heartfelt.\n \u0027You\u0027ve got to be excited by it?\u0027 \u0027Have I?\u0027\n \u0027Christ, yes. Bloody hell, for the first time we\u0027ve made contact with another intelligent life form. This could open up so many possibilities for us...\u0027\n \u0027What do you mean, another intelligent life form? You think mankind\u0027s intelligent? Jesus.\u0027\n \u0027But there\u0027s going to be so much we can learn from them, Clare. We don\u0027t know what kind of advances they might be able to...\u0027\n \u0027The only advances I\u0027m interested in,\u0027 she interrupted, \u0027are advances on my salary so that I can afford to pay the mortgage and keep a roof over our heads. What\u0027s it matter to me if they show us how to build spaceships or...?\u0027\n \u0027It might not matter now, but what about the future?\u0027\n \u0027What about the future?\u0027 she sighed. \u0027Look, I don\u0027t want to rain on your parade, Tom, but I\u0027ll be honest with you because I always am. I really don\u0027t give a shit what\u0027s happening in the next street, the next town, the next country or even the next bloody galaxy. All that I\u0027m concerned about is making sure that my little girl has what she needs and that she\u0027s happy. I\u0027ve got to put her first because no-one else ever will, will they? No one gives a flying fuck about her but me.\u0027\n I had obviously touched a nerve. I hadn\u0027t meant to upset her - it had been the last thing I\u0027d wanted to do. It didn\u0027t take a genius to see that she was still smarting from what her husband had done to her and Penny. She hadn\u0027t deserved any of it. No-one deserved that kind of treatment.\n \u0027You know that I\u0027m here if you need anything, don\u0027t you?\u0027 I said, struggling to find something constructive to say without overemphasising my concern or embarrassing my friend. \u0027I\u0027ll be around if you want me.\u0027\n She smiled.\n \u0027I know,\u0027 she sighed. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, I didn\u0027t mean to offload at you. I know you\u0027re here for both of us but...\u0027\n A moment\u0027s silence.\n \u0027But what?\u0027 I asked cautiously.\n \u0027But it\u0027s not the same, is it?\u0027\n \u0027How do you mean?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to offend you, Tom, but...\u0027 It was obvious that she was struggling to express her feelings.\n \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter,\u0027 I said, trying to save her the effort (and myself the hurt).\n \u0027Please don\u0027t take this the wrong way,\u0027 she continued, \u0027but you can\u0027t take the place of the man I married. No matter what he\u0027s done he\u0027s still Penny\u0027s dad and there\u0027s still a place for him here...\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not trying to take anyone\u0027s place,\u0027 I began pointlessly. \u0027I just want you to know that...\u0027\n I let my words trail away into an awkward silence. To my relief a change in the picture on the television screen brought a welcome distraction. It was another United Nations press conference. I picked up the remote control and turned up the volume so that I could hear the news.\n An extremely ordinary looking official stepped up to a plinth to deliver more extraordinary news. He cleared his throat and shuffled his papers.\n \u0027Further to the facts that were released earlier this morning,\u0027 he began, \u0027we\u0027re now able to bring you an update on the present situation. A thorough inspection and examination of the alien ship has been undertaken during the last few hours. The visitors have now concluded that the damage to the ship is beyond repair. To this end contact has been made with the alien home world today and a rescue mission has been dispatched. It is estimated that this will arrive within the next ten months.\u0027\n The official paused for a second and the gap in his delivery was seized upon by the hordes of media representatives gathered around. He held up his hands to try and calm the crowd.\n \u0027Bloody typical,\u0027 Clare hissed under her breath. \u0027I suppose that\u0027s it now, they\u0027ve got their feet well and truly under the table.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 I grunted, half-listening.\n \u0027We\u0027re never going to get rid of them now.\u0027\n \u0027Why do we want to get rid of them?\u0027\n \u0027I want to get rid of them,\u0027 she replied. \u0027I don\u0027t like them.\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t know anything about them.\u0027\n \u0027No-one knows anything about them...\u0027\n Simple and direct as it was, I couldn\u0027t argue with her logic. The United Nations spokesman continued;\n \u0027We have extended our earlier agreement and will allow the travellers asylum until their colleagues arrive. It\u0027s hoped that both the visitors and ourselves will be able to take advantage of this time together in order to learn about each other\u0027s planets, technologies and societies. This is an extremely important stage in both the history and future development of both races...\u0027\n \u0027Bullshit,\u0027 Clare interrupted again. \u0027Who the hell are they trying to fool? What are they going to learn from us? There\u0027s not going to be a fat lot we can tell them that they don\u0027t already know. Bloody hell, look at the state of their ship. We\u0027re still crashing planes...\u0027\n Again she was right. I wondered whether Clare really was as anti-alien as she sounded, or perhaps her venom was so obvious because she was just anti-everything at the present time? To her the sudden arrival of the aliens was nothing more than a temporary (and not very interesting) distraction. An unnecessary complication of her already unnecessarily complicated life.\n The man on the screen had still more to say.\n \u0027Finally, after several hours of discussions with the commander of the alien ship, it has been decided that the vessel will be destroyed. There is a very slight danger of a leak from the ship\u0027s engines and so it has been decided that it is in the best interests of all concerned if the ship is destroyed. Arrangements have been made to launch the vessel away from the planet and into the sun. We are certain that this will have no detrimental effect on the sun and it would seem to be the safest and most convenient way of avoiding and potential danger. Furthermore...\u0027 I didn\u0027t get to hear the official\u0027s last sentence. Clare switched the television off.\n \u0027Sorry,\u0027 she sighed, sounding tired and harassed, \u0027I\u0027ve heard enough for one day.\u0027\n I forced a smile and then looked deep into my friend\u0027s face.\n \u0027Look, I\u0027m only going to ask you this one more time, are you sure you\u0027re all right?\u0027\n For a fraction of a second I thought that Clare was about to become even more annoyed and defensive than she already had been. But instead she managed a smile and relaxed. She reached across and squeezed my hand.\n \u0027I\u0027m fine,\u0027 she sighed. \u0027I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m such a miserable bitch, it\u0027s just that...\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t have to explain,\u0027 I interrupted. \u0027As long as you\u0027re okay, that\u0027s all that matters.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m okay.\u0027\n Penny thumped into the room, leaving a trail of mud and dirt on the carpet behind her. Clare\u0027s face fell and, sensing that she was about to explode, I decided to make a move.\n \u0027I\u0027m off,\u0027 I said, walking towards the front door. \u0027I\u0027ll see you both soon.\u0027\n \u0027Okay,\u0027 Clare said as she followed me out. \u0027Thanks for what you\u0027ve done today. I really appreciate it.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s fine. And if you need anything else...\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll call you.\u0027\n \u0027Promise?\u0027\n \u0027Promise.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-7.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: \n The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
