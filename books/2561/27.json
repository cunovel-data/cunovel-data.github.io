{"id":112206,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"Having to fight to keep calm and stay in control I bundled Clare back indoors and slammed the door shut behind me. \u0027Why are those ships here?\u0027 she demanded as I pushed her towards the living room. \u0027No idea,\u0027 I gasped, forcing my words out between deep, nervous breaths. \u0027There are loads of the fucking things out there.\u0027 \u0027But why?\u0027 Ignoring her questions I instinctively grabbed at the phone again and held it to my ear. It was still dead and I angrily threw it back down to the table. \u0027Are they here to pick up the aliens?\u0027 she asked, pressing me for answers which she knew I couldn\u0027t give. \u0027Don\u0027t know. They could be.\u0027 \u0027But what else could they be doing...?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve told you,\u0027 I snapped. \u0027I don\u0027t know. For Christ\u0027s sake, I don\u0027t know any more than you do.\u0027 Maybe I could have thought of a hundred and one reasons why the ships might have arrived, but none of them would necessarily have been right. Whatever the reason, I knew we were in trouble. Each one of the ships on their own would have been sufficient to hold the three hundred and sixty-eight original aliens so why were there so many here? And from the time they\u0027d first made contact with us we had been told that it would take at least ten months for their rescuers to get here. Less than half that time had so far elapsed. \u0027We should wait here,\u0027 Clare rambled nervously. \u0027Wait here and...\u0027 \u0027Why? We\u0027ve done all our waiting, haven\u0027t we? We waited here all last night for the power to come back on and for Penny to...\u0027 \u0027Well what else are we going to do?\u0027 she screamed. I didn\u0027t know. I walked away. I had to think. The only logical explanation I could find - although it sounded bizarre and completely illogical - was that the behaviour of the population had been controlled and manipulated by the aliens. And the ships we had just seen must have been a part of the same plan. The bastard things had enslaved the whole bloody planet right under our noses. So why hadn\u0027t Clare and I succumbed? Why were we different? \u0027Stay here and keep out of sight,\u0027 I said suddenly. \u0027Don\u0027t go out and don\u0027t let anyone in.\u0027 \u0027Where you going?\u0027 she asked anxiously. \u0027To get Rob and Siobhan. I don\u0027t care what condition they\u0027re in, I\u0027m going to get them in the car and bring them back here.\u0027 \u0027You can\u0027t leave us!\u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t take you with me, can I? We can\u0027t risk moving Penny.\u0027 \u0027But you can\u0027t leave us...\u0027 \u0027I have to,\u0027 I sighed. \u0027I don\u0027t want to but I\u0027ve got to go. I need to know that Rob and Siobhan are safe. They\u0027re all I\u0027ve got left.\u0027 I walked over to Clare and held her tightly. Leaving the relative safety of the house really was the last thing I wanted to do but I didn\u0027t seem to have a choice. I couldn\u0027t bear the thought of Siobhan being alone with all of this going on. Even if she was still in the same desperate condition when I reached her today, at least we would be together again. I didn\u0027t think she\u0027d offer much resistance. And as for Rob, my duty to him was just as strong. \u0027I\u0027ll be back as soon as I can,\u0027 I said quietly. \u0027Okay,\u0027 she said, still holding on to me tightly. \u0027Just promise me that you\u0027ll keep the door locked and that you won\u0027t let anyone else in.\u0027 \u0027I promise. But what if...\u0027 \u0027No buts.\u0027 \u0027Okay.\u0027 Deliberately moving quickly so that I didn\u0027t have the opportunity to change my mind, I grabbed my coat and headed for the front door. Clare followed close behind me. \u0027See you later,\u0027 I muttered and, with that, I went outside and pulled the door shut behind me.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-27.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
