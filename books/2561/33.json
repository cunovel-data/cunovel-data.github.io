{"id":112212,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"By eight o\u0027clock the autumn light had gone and the world had been smothered by the cold, inky blackness of early evening. I had watched the last minutes of the day disappear from the bedroom window. Now the only lights to be seen anywhere came from the powerful engines of the countless alien machines that continued to busily twist and glide silently through the skies overhead.\\n\\n Through the long hours just passed both Clare and I had finally accepted that whatever we chose to do next didn\u0027t matter. The ultimate fate of our friends, families and, most probably, our own lives had been predetermined and there was nothing that either of us could do to alter the course of events. It was now just a question of finding somewhere safe and remote to hide for as long as possible. The alien had warned that if we kept out of the way we might still have some time. And the more I thought about it, the more I realised that could be longer than I\u0027d dared to imagine at first. We could have ten minutes left, but then again we could evade the alien hordes and live in hiding for the next seventy years. With the realisation that all might not be lost after all, something of my desire to go on slowly began to return. Clare remained unconvinced but as far as I was concerned there was still a faint glimmer of a chance, and no matter how slight, it was a chance that I was more than ready to take.\\n\\n My confidence was increasing. I went outside when, without warning, the overpowering and all-consuming silence had been shattered by the dull sound of hundreds of marching feet. Instantly recognisable as the same sound I\u0027d heard in Thatcham earlier that morning, I stood at the end of Clare\u0027s road and watched as yet another orderly file of emotionless figures trooped by. But this time they were walking away from the village and out towards the coast. They were gone in minutes and I ran back to the house, concerned and unnerved.\\n\\n \u0027We should move,\u0027 I said breathlessly as I let myself back in. \u0027I think we need to get out of here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027 she asked.\\n\\n \u0027The people I saw earlier are leaving the village.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So I don\u0027t feel safe here. What if the aliens are about to start work on the village? They might be about to demolish the whole fucking place and I don\u0027t want to be sat here when they...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where are we going to go?\u0027 she interrupted.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know. The alien told me that we\u0027d be safe if we kept out of the way. They\u0027re not interested in us.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And where exactly is out of the way? Bloody hell, those ships are everywhere. There\u0027s nowhere they can\u0027t get to.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 I snapped, frightened and trying hard to think.\\n\\n \u0027What we need,\u0027 Clare said quietly, \u0027is somewhere remote. We need a bloody island in the middle of the ocean. Somewhere where there\u0027s nothing they could want. Nothing there for them to destroy.\u0027 Her train of thought was logical and it led me to an answer.\\n\\n \u0027What about the Devil\u0027s Peak?\u0027 I said, remembering the small collection of water-worn rocks just off the coast. \u0027If we could get out there we should be safe for a while. Joe Porter told me there\u0027s a cove round the back where you can moor a boat. Told me he used to go there when he was a lad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But is there any point?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Probably not. It\u0027s worth a try though.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Suppose, but how are we going to get there?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I can think of at least three places down the coastal path where there are usually boats moored at this time of year.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can you sail?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No but I can row. Come on, we\u0027ve got to try, haven\u0027t we? Bloody hell, if we just end up floating miles out to sea it couldn\u0027t be any worse than sitting here and waiting for something to happen, could it? And if those bastards really do have plans for this place then...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Okay,\u0027 she mumbled, sounding far from sure.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll get a few things together and get moving. The quicker we get out of here, the better our chances are.\u0027\\n\\n We were ready to leave in minutes. We silently worked together in the shadowy gloom of the kitchen, packing all the food and supplies we could find into two light and waterproof rucksacks and a battered sports holdall. I was distracted by the sound of sudden rain clattering against the window. I looked up and watched the clouds rush by with an ominous speed. A swirling, racing darkness only interrupted by the alien ships burning their way through the sky.\\n\\n \u0027You all right?\u0027 Clare asked, her voice little more than a tired whisper. She had noticed that I\u0027d stopped. I nodded instinctively.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m okay,\u0027 I lied. \u0027What about you? You about ready?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just about,\u0027 she mumbled as she struggled with one of the straps on her rucksack. I stared into her face. She was a million miles away and I guessed that she was thinking about Penny and everything else that she had lost. The thought of her pain reminded me of my own. It all felt as cold, empty and hopeless as the day Mum and Dad died.\\n\\n Without warning the room was filled with brilliant blue-white light. I lifted my hand to shield my eyes and turned away from a sudden wave of heat. It faded away to almost nothing again in seconds and I stepped out into the back garden to see the disappearing engine-light of a low flying silver shuttle. The aliens seemed to be getting lower. Perhaps they were about to put in a long-overdue personal appearance on the land that they had taken from us.\\n\\n Clare came out to me. She was struggling with both the rucksacks. She handed one over.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s get moving,\u0027 she said, managing a fleeting smile.\\n\\n My legs suddenly felt weak and heavy. I didn\u0027t want to leave the house but I knew we had little choice.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027ll be all right,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027Well that\u0027s what you keep telling me, anyway.\u0027\\n\\n I nodded, fastened my coat and pulled the rucksack onto my shoulders. I stepped back into the house momentarily to collect the holdall and then returned to stand by Clare\u0027s side. It was bitterly cold and already I could see that her teeth were chattering.\\n\\n \u0027So which way do we go?\u0027 she whispered.\\n\\n I wiped spitting rain from my face and looked around. The world suddenly seemed uncomfortably huge.\\n\\n \u0027Straight across the fields I think,\u0027 I replied, pointing beyond the low stone wall at the bottom of the garden. \u0027If we keep heading that way we should hit the main coast road before long.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And then what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know. Depends where we pick it up. We\u0027ll just head up or down the coast until we find a boat.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure? You don\u0027t sound it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not,\u0027 I answered honestly. \u0027But I don\u0027t think that...\u0027\\n\\n I stopped talking when another shuttle appeared. It flew directly across our line of vision from right to left, hugging the ground and dipping and rising with the troughs and peaks of the land. It was gone in seconds.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s move,\u0027 Clare said quietly.\\n\\n I hitched the rucksack up into a more comfortable position on my back and began to walk down the garden path. We clambered over the stone wall and then, holding one of the holdall\u0027s handles each, we began to make our way nervously through the fields behind the house and down towards the ocean. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-33.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
