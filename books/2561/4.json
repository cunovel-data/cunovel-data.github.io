{"id":112183,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"When I moved to Thatcham I made a real and very conscious effort to try and keep myself to myself. It wasn\u0027t that I didn\u0027t want to be with anyone else, rather I didn\u0027t want to be drawn into communal life. I didn\u0027t want to become just one of the crowd or part of the fixtures and fittings. I wanted some space and some distance from the rest of the world around me. Unfortunately it didn\u0027t work.\n Drink was my problem.\n I was developing a real taste for beer, and it was fast becoming part of the regular routine that I\u0027d vowed never to have. Siobhan, a few friends and myself had got into the habit of going into The Badger\u0027s Sett pub every Friday night for a few drinks. I hadn\u0027t realised that it had become so routine until, last Friday, I\u0027d walked in there and found my drink waiting on the bar for me. Ray Mercer - the landlord - had poured it ready.\n This Friday most people needed a drink more than usual.\n Siobhan called at the house just before eight. I watched her arrive from the bedroom window and followed her every step as she walked up the short garden path and let herself in. There was no getting away from the fact that she was absolutely bloody beautiful. The intense buzz of excitement when I saw her was as strong today as it had always been. A clich - perhaps but true nonetheless - she was an inspiration to me. There had been some dark days recently - perhaps the darkest days - and she\u0027d been the single beacon of light that had guided me safely through it all.\n She was standing in front of the TV when I walked into the living room. I didn\u0027t say anything. I just crept up behind her, wrapped my arms around her and held her tight.\n \u0027You okay?\u0027 I asked, whispering softly into her ear.\n She pushed herself away slightly and turned around so that she could look into my face. She smiled and nodded and we kissed with the kind of passion normally reserved for lovers who have been separated for days or weeks. It had only been a few hours since we\u0027d last been together.\n \u0027I\u0027m fine,\u0027 she replied, still close and with her gentle breath ticking my face. \u0027Are you?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m okay.\u0027\n She sat down on the sofa. Like the rest of the population Siobhan was transfixed by the activity out over the ocean and she stared at the television screen in the corner of the room. I, on the other hand, continued to stare at her. Of course I was interested and anxious to know what was happening out at sea, but staring at Siobhan was infinitely preferable. She looked incredible in a short summer dress which left little to the imagination. That wasn\u0027t a problem, because there wasn\u0027t any aspect of her perfect body which my vivid imagination hadn\u0027t already explored a thousand times or more. The clouds had lifted outside and brilliant orange sunlight flooded into the room, blinding her momentarily and obscuring her view of the TV screen. I took advantage of the distraction.\n \u0027You look fantastic,\u0027 I said as I sat down next to her and pushed my head close to hers. She wrapped her arms (and then her long legs) around me and pulled me close.\n \u0027Only fantastic?\u0027 she teased, her voice deliberately low and sultry. \u0027No,\u0027 I replied, shuffling closer to her (and shuffling to get comfortable because my trousers were tight and were becoming tighter by the second), \u0027you look fucking fantastic.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s better.\u0027\n I wanted her and she knew it. She was playing with me, and she was driving me wild.\n \u0027Fancy me?\u0027 she asked. She knew the obvious answer. Something about the way I was literally drooling over her must have given my less than subtle interest away.\n \u0027You know I do,\u0027 I answered, my breathing suddenly shallow.\n \u0027Want me?\u0027\n She stretched her legs further round until they held me tight. She pulled me down until the hard bulge in my jeans was pressed tight against her.\n \u0027That\u0027s a stupid question...\u0027\n Robert walked into the room.\n \u0027Christ, give it a rest will you?\u0027 he sighed. I rolled over and sat down next to Siobhan, instantly deflated. Out of my brother\u0027s view she rested her hand on my crotch and squeezed.\n \u0027Later,\u0027 she whispered. \u0027I promise.\u0027\n \u0027Can\u0027t you leave each other alone for a few minutes,\u0027 Rob whined sarcastically.\n We sat and waited for James Marchant, a friend of ours, to arrive. He eventually turned up at twenty past eight (fifty minutes later than planned - something of an improvement for James) and made no apology. James was a hardworking man (he still worked for the firm I recently resigned from) and, a couple of months ago, his wife had given birth to their forth child. If anyone had a valid excuse for being late, it was James.\n The four of us were uncharacteristically quiet as we walked through the village to the pub. With everything that had happened today we had plenty to talk about but I guessed that each of us needed time to individually come to terms with the unexpected events of the day. Once we were ready, I decided, then the alien arrival would no doubt become the mainstay of virtually every conversation for weeks to come.\n The Badger\u0027s Sett was packed. Drinkers had overflowed outside and were sitting on the grass in front of the building, on the low stone wall surrounding it, on the bonnets of their cars in the car park - anywhere that they could find a space. Once inside I pushed my way through to the bar while the other three looked for a table. Ray Mercer acknowledged me from a distance. By the time I\u0027d fought my way through to him he was already in the middle of pouring our usual round of drinks.\n \u0027Bloody hell, Ray,\u0027 I yelled, struggling to make myself heard over the dull roar of conversation and thumping music. \u0027Busy, aren\u0027t you?\u0027\n He nodded.\n \u0027Been like it all afternoon, Tom,\u0027 he shouted as he took my money. \u0027Not complaining though. Bloody aliens can come here every Friday if it\u0027s going to do this to me profits!\u0027\n \u0027You must have the whole village in here!\u0027 \u0027I think everyone needs a drink after today...\u0027\n Ray disappeared to serve another customer and I began the precarious journey across the room to find the others.\n \u0027It\u0027s heaving in here,\u0027 Rob said, stating the obvious as I reached the small table they\u0027d found in a hidden corner.\n \u0027We could go back to mine later,\u0027 I suggested. \u0027I can hardly hear myself think.\u0027\n The atmosphere was hot and dry. I picked up my pint and knocked half of it back with a couple of long, thirsty gulps.\n \u0027So,\u0027 I said, wiping my lips, \u0027what are we going to talk about?\u0027 The others laughed - the answer was obvious.\n \u0027The weather?\u0027 offered Siobhan.\n \u0027Football?\u0027 tried James.\n \u0027Alien invasions?\u0027 said Rob, unable to think of anything else to say.\n And that was it. For the next two hours we talked about nothing else. Each one of us recounted exactly where we\u0027d been and what we were doing when the alien ship had arrived. We shared our questions, fears, concerns and anything else that came into our minds over far too many pints of beer.\n It was a strange night. Nowhere near as strange as the afternoon that had preceded it mind, but still strange nonetheless.\n Locked in constant, fierce competition with The Sun (the pub across the road), The Badger\u0027s Sett was a warm, comfortable and welcoming place. The drink was always good, there was always hot and cold food available and there wasn\u0027t a single video game machine in sight. It was a traditional British pub - the traditional heart of a traditional British village - and not really the kind of place where you\u0027d expect to find yourself debating mankind\u0027s position in the universe. But at that moment it seemed as good a place as any.\n By ten o\u0027clock our usually relaxing surroundings had become even more crowded and was filled with even more smoke and noise. The day\u0027s events, our long conversation and the effect of copious alcohol combined to leave the four of us sitting round the table feeling suddenly quiet, insular and reflective. For a time the conversation between us was sparse, forced and sporadic.\n My eyes were becoming heavy and the smoke hanging in the air was beginning to make them sting. I excused myself and stood up and went outside to get some air. When I returned (only a few minutes later) I noticed that Ray had dragged an old television set out of one of the pub\u0027s back rooms and had set it up at the far end of the bar. Without warning Ken Trentham - by habit one of Thatcham\u0027s most miserable and reclusive inhabitants - grabbed hold of my arm and stopped me as I made my way back to my friends.\n \u0027What\u0027s going on?\u0027 he mumbled. \u0027What d\u0027you think they\u0027re doing here?\u0027\n \u0027No idea, Ken,\u0027 I answered abruptly, keen to get away. \u0027I\u0027ve never known anything like it,\u0027 he whispered dramatically.\n \u0027None of us have,\u0027 I replied as I tried to push past him and get back to the others.\n \u0027Nothing good\u0027ll come of this,\u0027 he hissed, leaning towards me secretively. \u0027You mark my words.\u0027\n \u0027Whatever,\u0027 I mumbled, trying hard not to breathe in. The old man stank - an acute and repugnant combination of stale alcohol and halitosis. He stared into my face with cloudy, bloodshot eyes.\n Trentham turned away for a second to pick up his pint and I seized on the chance to get away.\n \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 I gasped as I sat down heavily on my hard wooden chair.\n \u0027Christ, was that Ken Trentham you were speaking to?\u0027 Siobhan asked incredulously.\n I nodded.\n \u0027Well, it was more a case of him speaking to me,\u0027 I smiled, \u0027but yes, it was Trentham.\u0027\n \u0027I didn\u0027t know you knew that dirty old bugger,\u0027 James said. \u0027I\u0027ve lived round here for almost twenty years and I\u0027ve only ever seen him talk to his dog before now...\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know him,\u0027 I said defensively.\n \u0027It\u0027s not like him to be so sociable...\u0027\n \u0027Fucking hell,\u0027 laughed Rob, \u0027he must be their first victim!\u0027\n \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 asked Siobhan, confused.\n \u0027The aliens,\u0027 he grinned. \u0027Can\u0027t you see what they\u0027re doing? They\u0027ve only been here for a few hours and already they\u0027re screwing up the minds of normally upstanding members of the community! Before you know it we\u0027ll all...\u0027\n \u0027Bullshit!\u0027 I snapped.\n Rob shrugged his shoulders.\n \u0027Of course it is.\u0027\n \u0027People are acting differently though,\u0027 Siobhan whispered.\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 asked James.\n She shrugged her shoulders.\n \u0027Well just look at this place,\u0027 she said, \u0027it\u0027s packed. It\u0027s like a show of unity, isn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027Is it?\u0027\n \u0027Yes. It\u0027s the old Dunkirk spirit rearing its head again.\u0027 A little uncertain, she paused and looked around the table. \u0027The rules changed today, didn\u0027t they?\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re right. There\u0027s a new player in the game,\u0027 Rob agreed. \u0027None of us know who they are or what they\u0027re going to do and it\u0027s making us feel nervous. I don\u0027t suppose anyone here knows they\u0027re doing it.\u0027 \u0027Doing what?\u0027 interrupted James who seemed to be missing the point.\n \u0027Bonding together,\u0027 I explained. \u0027Like with like, can\u0027t you see it? This ship has arrived and it\u0027s different, and suddenly it doesn\u0027t matter what race you are, what religion you are, we\u0027re all the same.\u0027\n \u0027The same?\u0027\n \u0027Well, less different than we were this morning...\u0027\n I stopped speaking. The pub had suddenly become silent.\n The jukebox had been switched off.\n No-one at the bar was being served.\n A brief blast of static and white-noise filled the air as Ray struggled to force an aerial lead into the back of the television set.\n More silence.\n Then more hissing. More static.\n More silence.\n A flickering picture appeared on the screen, disappeared and then reappeared seconds later.\n \u0027Got it!\u0027 yelled Ray.\n A perfect picture (from where we were sitting) and clear sound.\n I struggled for a second or two to focus through the smoky haze. The television showed more pictures of the alien ship hovering over the ocean. The scene was darker, of course, and a hundred dancing spotlights now ran continually along the smooth underbelly of the vast machine, but generally nothing seemed to have changed.\n \u0027Silly beggars,\u0027 Mrs Grayson, the lady who worked in the newsagent\u0027s said. Her voice was so loud and shrill that everyone could hear her. We used to joke that when she spoke her squeal was so high-pitched that it made the dogs in the street stop and run to her whenever she opened her mouth. \u0027The whole of the bloody universe to chose from and those daft sods wind up here at the back-end of nowhere!\u0027\n \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 Rob whispered, \u0027can you imagine what the odds against them turning up here must have been?\u0027\n He was right. The chances of the aliens finding our planet must have been slim enough, but to have stumbled upon our village? It defied all comprehension.\n Rob got up and went to fetch more drinks.\n I shuffled my seat round so that I had a better view of the television screen, taking care to stay close to Siobhan. Her hand was resting on my knee. Her touch was more comforting and reassuring than usual tonight.\n \u0027It\u0027s hard to believe that the rest of the world is watching us here,\u0027 she said under her breath. \u0027Just think, millions of people round the world are watching the same pictures as we are, and we\u0027re only a few miles away from where it\u0027s all happening.\u0027\n \u0027Makes you nervous, doesn\u0027t it?\u0027 I said, suddenly feeling brave enough to be honest about my emotions. \u0027I just want to know what they\u0027re here for.\u0027\n Robert returned to the table and put down another round of drinks. He spilled half of my pint - he couldn\u0027t cope with handing round the beers and watching the television at the same time. I tried to mop up the spilt drink with an already soggy beer mat and, as I did so, I became aware that the pub had fallen silent again. I looked up, instantly unnerved.\n Every face was angled towards the television set, and every last face bore an expression of bewildered fascination and uncertainty. I rubbed my tired eyes and stared into the flickering screen.\n The pictures being broadcast were still coming from a position similar to that from which the footage we had seen earlier in the day had been shot. The dark and featureless alien ship was silhouetted against the clear, star-filled sky and it\u0027s immense belly was gently illuminated by lights from the countless ships floating on the rolling ocean below. As I watched, a large rectangular section of the vessel\u0027s metal skin began to slowly slide back in on itself leaving a wide, black hole in the machine\u0027s otherwise featureless undercarriage. I swallowed hard (my mouth was dry) and watched as a soft light began to shine out from the insides of the ship. A sleek, bright and smooth, streamlined object (a missile perhaps?) drifted down into the space between the ship and the surface of the ocean and then stopped. It just hung there, completely motionless.\n \u0027What the fucking hell is that?\u0027 Robert croaked, his voice also dry with nerves. \u0027You don\u0027t think that...\u0027 He stopped himself from completing his half-finished sentence.\n The pictures on the television screen continued although I feared that, if it was some kind of alien weapon which had just appeared, the live transmission might be cut at any second. In the dark haze on the screen I could just about make out countless shifting shapes scurrying to and fro on the decks of the cruisers and battleships that had gathered there in the past few hours. Within a minute of the mysterious new object appearing the sky had filled with swarms of jets, helicopters and surveillance aircraft. Every last weapon on the deck of every last one of the floating war machines was primed and trained skywards, all aimed towards the awesome creation hanging soundless and motionless in the turbulent night air.\n A brilliant electric-blue light began to shine out from the back of the second, smaller alien ship and then, as I held my breath along with the rest of the planet, it gracefully swooped down towards the surface of the water. Instinctively I squeezed Siobhan\u0027s hand and she pulled me closer to her. Like a glider drifting back down to land, the second ship soared silently through the night, eventually stopping perfectly still just a few feet above the rolling waves.\n Every single available spotlight was fixed on the new machine. And every face in the room continued to stare at the television set on the bar. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-4.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: \n The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
