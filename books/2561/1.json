{"id":112180,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Once I get outside I\u0027m fine.\n All the nervousness, the trepidation and the apprehension disappears in seconds. You just keep putting one foot in front of the other.\n People ask me why I run but I never give them a straight answer. I never give them an honest answer. I give them all the usual bullshit about keeping fit and healthy and I might tell them that I run because it\u0027s good to get out and find all those places you can\u0027t get to by car. When you\u0027re running, I sometimes tell them, you\u0027re everything and you\u0027re nothing. You don\u0027t matter to anyone but yourself. You can run past a hundred people and none of them know how far you\u0027ve run or how much you\u0027re hurting. I tell people that I like to run because I like the quiet. I tell them I like to be on my own. I sometimes tell them that I like to think, but I never tell anyone what I think about.\n I left home just under half an hour ago. There were a few grey clouds on the horizon. Now the entire sky is almost completely black and I know that in a couple of seconds the sun will disappear. There\u0027s a lone pocket of blue sky above me which is about to be swallowed up by dark clouds attacking it from all directions. I\u0027ve seen this happen before when a storm\u0027s been brewing. The clouds suddenly stop following each other and start to criss-cross the sky at different heights and different speeds. Unpredictable and unstoppable. My legs are aching and my head is pounding. The atmosphere is heavy and oppressive and there\u0027s a cold wind suddenly gusting all around me.\n Christ, here it comes. I\u0027ve done almost four miles and I\u0027m soaked with sweat and now here comes the rain to make the last mile and a half home even more difficult. I\u0027ve run down sheltered streets lined with buildings and footpaths covered by a canopy of trees but it\u0027s only now that I\u0027m out here with no protection that the rain is really beginning to pour down. There\u0027s nothing I can do but keep on running. The harder I push myself, the sooner I\u0027ll be home.\n Bloody hell. Now this is the real reason why I run.\n I must have followed this dirt track a hundred times but it still takes my breath away. The rain\u0027s ice-cold and it\u0027s crashing down all around me now but it doesn\u0027t seem to matter. The view here is incredible. The muddy path is never more than a couple of feet across even at its widest point and it\u0027s hard going - boggy and uneven - but it\u0027s worth it when I reach the top of the hill. I\u0027m out on the edge when I reach the top of the hills, following the line of the cliffs. A two hundred foot drop and nothing to see but the ocean.\n The rain\u0027s so heavy now that it\u0027s almost like a mist. There\u0027s the first growl of thunder - a low, ominous rumble that I can feel through the ground. I can feel it in my legs and my belly. Exhilarating and humbling. A sudden split-second flash of electric blue light and another crack of thunder and now I\u0027m beginning to wonder whether I\u0027m in trouble here. I\u0027m out on my own with no protection. I\u0027m cold and wet and I feel as exposed as an electricity pylon. I might as well be playing golf as running.\n There\u0027s another flash of light. This time I\u0027m looking in the right direction, straight out over the ocean. The lightning seemed to hit the water just past the first rocks of the Devil\u0027s Peak. If I close my eyes I can still see it in negative. But closing my eyes is the last thing I want to do up here. Shit, almost lost my footing. I\u0027ve got to concentrate. One slip and I\u0027ve had it. It was a bloody stupid idea to come up this way today.\n I never stop when I\u0027m running. It\u0027s hard to get going again once you\u0027ve slowed down. But something\u0027s not right. I can\u0027t put my finger on it. The rain\u0027s even colder now I\u0027m standing still but that\u0027s not important. I can hear something over the noise of the sea and the storm. I can hear a new sound. A different sound.\n There\u0027s a jet.\n No, wait. There\u0027s more than one.\n They don\u0027t usually fly much at this time of day, and certainly not in this weather unless there\u0027s a damn good reason. There are five of them flying in an arrowhead formation. When they fly along the valley they\u0027re a hundred times faster and nowhere near as loud as this. They\u0027re never usually this close to each other.\n There are even more of them.\n I can see seven jets now, sleek and dark, still flying in formation but they\u0027re getting lower. One by one they\u0027re emerging from the heavy cloud cover. They\u0027re well away from the land now and out over the ocean.\n There\u0027s something else behind them.\n They\u0027re leading it out of the clouds. Jesus Christ.\n Whatever this thing is it\u0027s huge. It\u0027s black and it\u0027s fucking enormous. Fucking hell, I\u0027ve never seen anything like it. It\u0027s silent. All I can hear are the jets surrounding it. This thing is immense and it\u0027s not making a bloody sound. It seems to be going on forever - hundreds and hundreds of metres of Christ knows what stretching down through the clouds and out over the ocean. It looks and moves like a fucking submarine carving its way through the turbulent air. Its vast belly is black, smooth and featureless but for a few bright pinpricks of light towards the front. I can\u0027t even begin to estimate the size of this thing.\n There are jets surrounding the entire machine. They look so small that they\u0027re like the shadows of scavenging birds against it. I can see the back end of it now - there\u0027s a huge brilliant ball of blue-white light behind the ship. That must be what\u0027s powering it. How can it be so quiet? Christ, how can something so big move without making a sound? All I can hear are the jets and the storm.\n I can\u0027t look at the light. It\u0027s so bright and powerful. Jesus, I can feel my skin beginning to prickle and tighten with the heat. The rain and sweat is evaporating and there\u0027s steam snaking up from my skin.\n The distance is deceptive. The whole convoy is moving at speed.\n Just a couple of minutes since the first jet appeared and the last one is now disappearing from view. All I can see is the ball of light moving out to sea.\n A second of silence, and then the sound of the waves on the rocks below and the driving rain returns a thousand times louder than before.\n I\u0027ve got to get home. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-1.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: \n The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
