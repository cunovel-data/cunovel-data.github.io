{"id":112201,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Clare telephoned me later.\n I was sitting alone in the house again and I was glad of the interruption. I had been dragging myself down again, thinking dark, pointless thoughts when the call had come. I was sitting next to the telephone contemplating calling Siobhan. Clare provided me with the perfect excuse not to.\n \u0027You okay?\u0027 I asked.\n \u0027I\u0027m okay,\u0027 she replied softly. She didn\u0027t sound too good, but at least she, unlike just about everyone else I knew, wasn\u0027t yelling groundless accusations at me. Yet.\n \u0027Penny enjoy her burger yesterday?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said quickly. \u0027Yes, she really did. Didn\u0027t stop talking about it all night...\u0027\n \u0027But...?\u0027 I pushed, sensing that there was more she wasn\u0027t telling me.\n \u0027But what?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know, you tell me. You sound distant. Is everything all right? Has Penny\u0027s dad done something else that\u0027s...\u0027 \u0027No, I haven\u0027t heard from him.\u0027\n \u0027Then what is it?\u0027\n Clare was silent. The longer the silence lasted, the more uneasy and worried I began to feel.\n \u0027Are you still there?\u0027 I asked cautiously.\n \u0027I\u0027m here.\u0027\n \u0027So what\u0027s up? Is it something I\u0027ve done?\u0027 I asked anxiously. It was beginning to feel like I was gradually turning everyone else against me. It was logical to assume that Clare might also have turned too.\n \u0027Christ, no,\u0027 she replied, her voice suddenly a little louder and more confident. \u0027You haven\u0027t done anything.\u0027\n \u0027What is it then?\u0027\n I hated playing games and being messed around. In my current state of mind I considered telling her as much.\n \u0027Bloody hell, you\u0027re going to think I\u0027m off my head,\u0027 she eventually said.\n \u0027Try me.\u0027\n I heard her take a deep breath.\n \u0027It\u0027s Penny,\u0027 she quietly admitted.\n \u0027What about her?\u0027\n \u0027She fucking hates me.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027\n Another awkward silence.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know how else to put it, Tom. She hate\u0027s me. She\u0027s...\u0027\n \u0027She\u0027s what?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, Jesus, I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on anymore. I think she must be ill. She was fine when we got home yesterday and she seemed all right this morning when I took her to nursery. It\u0027s only since I picked her up that I\u0027ve noticed it.\u0027\n \u0027Noticed what?\u0027 I asked, concerned. \u0027What\u0027s the matter with her?\u0027\n \u0027I can\u0027t explain,\u0027 she sighed, her voice rapidly filling with emotion. \u0027I\u0027m probably just being paranoid but I\u0027m really worried. I\u0027ve never seen her like this before. It\u0027s like I\u0027ve bought someone else\u0027s child home with me by mistake.\u0027\n \u0027So what\u0027s she doing?\u0027\n Yet another pause. \u0027It must be me you know, Tom. I must have changed. I must have said something because it\u0027s almost as if she can\u0027t stand to be in the same room as me anymore. She came downstairs for a few minutes for her tea but she didn\u0027t say a frigging word. She\u0027s been up in her bedroom ever since.\u0027\n \u0027Has it got anything to do with her dad? Do you think he saw her at nursery today?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. I think he\u0027s working away...\u0027\n \u0027Do you think she could be reacting because she didn\u0027t see him yesterday. She might not have said anything but kids do pick up on things...\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 she snapped again.\n \u0027It\u0027s got to be that, or something else that happened at nursery perhaps? Maybe another one of the other children said something to her and...\u0027\n \u0027So why doesn\u0027t she tell me?\u0027 Clare interrupted. \u0027Why is she taking it out on me like this?\u0027\n \u0027Because you\u0027re her mum? Because you\u0027re the only one there. Because you\u0027re the one she sees the most and you\u0027re the only one she\u0027s got to blame?\u0027\n I didn\u0027t like being so blunt with Clare, but she needed to be told. I didn\u0027t think for a second that Penny really did hate her. Yesterday the two of them had been inseparable. I felt sure that the little girl was suffering greatly as a result of the break-up of her parent\u0027s marriage. She was too young and innocent to be able to put her feelings and concerns into words. Maybe this was her way of dealing with what had happened?\n \u0027I\u0027m frightened,\u0027 Clare said, her voice little more than a fragile whisper.\n \u0027Why? What is there to be frightened of? This is just a phase she\u0027s going through.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not sure...\u0027\n \u0027Look, she\u0027ll snap out of this as quickly as she managed to snap into it,\u0027 I interrupted. \u0027I\u0027m sure she will.\u0027\n I didn\u0027t have much confidence in what I was saying. I thought it was what Clare needed to hear.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 she mumbled. At that moment I began to sense that there really could be something wrong with the little girl - her mother\u0027s intuition was rarely wrong. \u0027I\u0027ve seen her have bad moods and off-days before, but never anything like this. She\u0027s never been like this before...\u0027\n \u0027Why do you say that? What\u0027s different about today?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve heard her throwing things around her room. And when I try to go up and see her she slams the door and sits with her back against it so I can\u0027t get in. She tried to shove her bed across to block it but it was too heavy for her.\u0027\n \u0027What?\u0027 I said, trying to make sense of what I was being told.\n \u0027I swear, Tom, she\u0027s not my Penny tonight. I sat outside her room for over an hour before I phoned you. I could hear her crying and talking to herself and...\u0027\n \u0027And what?\u0027 \u0027And I\u0027ve just never seen her like this before. And I\u0027m frightened.\u0027\n \u0027People have bad days,\u0027 I said pathetically, trying unsuccessfully to reassure her. \u0027Take Joe Porter for example. I was helping out on the farm today. I\u0027d been there for a couple of hours and the cantankerous old bastard just turned on me.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t know. Practically ordered me off his land.\u0027\n \u0027So what had you done?\u0027\n \u0027Nothing.\u0027\n \u0027You must have done something.\u0027\n \u0027Not that I know of.\u0027\n \u0027So what are you saying? That there\u0027s something in the bloody water?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 I snapped, annoyed that she was mocking me, \u0027I\u0027m just trying to say that...\u0027\n I shut up quickly when I realised that I didn\u0027t know what I was trying to say at all.\n \u0027Can you hear that?\u0027 Clare asked.\n \u0027I can\u0027t hear anything.\u0027\n \u0027Listen...\u0027\n I held my breath and listened carefully with the phone pressed hard against my ear. I could hear something, but I didn\u0027t know what it was. I concentrated as hard as I could but it was difficult to hear anything more than a few muffled bangs and dull and distant crashes.\n \u0027What is it?\u0027 I wondered.\n \u0027That\u0027s Penny.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s she doing?\u0027\n \u0027Tearing her room apart. Throwing things at the door. I told you, she\u0027s been like this since we got home. I\u0027ve yelled at her and I\u0027ve begged her to stop but...\u0027\n \u0027Why\u0027s she doing it?\u0027\n I knew that was a bloody stupid question to ask.\n \u0027Don\u0027t know. You tell me. I wish someone would.\u0027\n Clare was crying.\n \u0027Do you want me to come over?\u0027 I asked pointlessly.\n \u0027Why? What are you going to be able to do?\u0027\n \u0027You need someone with you. What about your mum?\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s not here. She\u0027s staying with my aunt in London .\u0027\n \u0027Is there anyone else who could...\u0027\n \u0027Who could what? What\u0027s anyone else going to be able to do?\u0027\n \u0027Have you thought about calling the doctor out? He might be able to give her something to...\u0027\n \u0027She doesn\u0027t need drugs,\u0027 she said abruptly.\n \u0027Look, just do me a favour and think about it will you?\u0027 I pleaded. \u0027It might help her to...\u0027\n \u0027No!\u0027\n \u0027Maybe she just needs sleep then. Let her get this out of her system and I bet she\u0027ll be fine in the morning.\u0027\n \u0027Do you really think so?\u0027\n If I was completely honest I didn\u0027t, but that wasn\u0027t what I told Clare.\n \u0027Of course I do,\u0027 I lied through gritted teeth.\n I heard another loud crash from the other end of the phone line. Clare sniffed back more tears.\n \u0027I\u0027ve got to go,\u0027 she sobbed.\n \u0027Do you want me to come over?\u0027 I asked again.\n \u0027No, it\u0027s okay. If I need you I\u0027ll call.\u0027\n Another crash. I heard Clare call out to Penny before she put the phone down. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-22.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: \n The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
