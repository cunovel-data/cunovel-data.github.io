{"id":112196,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"At seven-thirty on Tuesday evening Rob brought an alien home with him. He\u0027d been shopping in Dreighton when he\u0027d met the visitor. The novelty of their unexpected arrival on our planet and their unusual appearance had long since worn off, but I still found it difficult to come to terms with the fact that an alien had just walked through my front door. \u0027This is a friend of mine, Tom,\u0027 Rob said as he introduced me to the tall and gangly figure standing next to him. \u0027I met him while I was in town. I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d mind if he came back for a drink and something to eat.\u0027 \u0027Pleased to meet you,\u0027 the visitor said, confidently reaching out a spindly hand in front of him. I took hold of it and shook it firmly, staring down as the long extended fingers wrapped around my hand and wrist. \u0027I hope you don\u0027t mind my being here...\u0027 I shook my head. \u0027No, it\u0027s fine...\u0027 I mumbled, still shocked. \u0027You okay?\u0027 Rob asked, immediately picking up on my obvious unease and surprise. \u0027Fine,\u0027 I replied. I really didn\u0027t mind the visitor being there, I was just struggling to get over the sudden shock of the unannounced arrival. It would have been okay if I\u0027d had a little time to prepare. It was one thing seeing the aliens on television and even passing them in the street, but in my hallway...? \u0027There you go,\u0027 Rob said to his new friend. \u0027Told you he\u0027d make you welcome.\u0027 The three of us stood there for a few long seconds in an uncomfortable, awkward silence. As the host (no matter how surprised or unwilling) I took it upon myself to try and break the ice. I stood to one side so that the alien had a clear view through to the living room. \u0027Go on through,\u0027 I said, gesturing deeper into the house. Rob led the alien down the hallway. Ignorant to his arrival, Siobhan stepped out of the kitchen just in time to see our guest\u0027s wiry frame disappear through the living room door. \u0027Was that...?\u0027 she began to ask. I nodded. \u0027Certainly was. Rob brought him back with him from...\u0027 I didn\u0027t bother to finish my sentence because it was obvious that Siobhan wasn\u0027t listening. Like one of the children of Hamlin following the Pied Piper she quickly wandered down the hall and peered round into the living room. I followed at a cautious distance. By the time I had reached the three of them the introductions were already being made. \u0027This is Siobhan,\u0027 Rob said. \u0027She\u0027s Tom\u0027s girlfriend. Bloody beautiful, isn\u0027t she? Christ knows what she sees in my brother...\u0027 \u0027She must like him,\u0027 the alien said quietly and factually, completely misunderstanding Rob\u0027s pathetic attempt at being funny. \u0027Hello,\u0027 Siobhan mumbled, uncharacteristically timidly. She squirmed and smiled like an embarrassed teenager being introduced to their favourite pop star. \u0027So what\u0027s your name?\u0027 I asked from the doorway. A perfectly reasonable question. \u0027I can\u0027t say it,\u0027 Rob replied. The alien turned round to look at me. \u0027You wouldn\u0027t be able to pronounce it.\u0027 \u0027Try me,\u0027 I snapped. I didn\u0027t like being told that I wouldn\u0027t be able to do something by anyone, certainly not by an alien. Rob seemed to pick up on my irritation and immediately did his best to try and diffuse the situation. \u0027I\u0027ve been calling him John,\u0027 he said. \u0027You don\u0027t mind that, do you John?\u0027 \u0027John\u0027 shook his bulbous head. \u0027I don\u0027t mind. It doesn\u0027t really matter. Popular name, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 \u0027Used to be the most popular name,\u0027 Siobhan said. The alien managed a thin-lipped smile. \u0027Thought so.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 asked Rob. \u0027Because a lot of my friends have been given human names by the people they\u0027ve met. Not including me I know of seventeen Johns, four Stevens, three Christophers and one Thomas!\u0027 That really annoyed me. I didn\u0027t know why, but it did. \u0027Who wants a drink?\u0027 I grumbled. \u0027Beers for us two please, Tom,\u0027 Rob answered. \u0027And me,\u0027 added Siobhan. \u0027Can you have beer?\u0027 I asked, nodding in the general direction of the alien. \u0027I\u0027m old enough, if that\u0027s what you mean,\u0027 he replied, deadpan. The supercilious tone of his voice was infuriating. I couldn\u0027t tell if he was intentionally trying to wind me up or whether he was just doing it by chance. I walked out to the kitchen and fetched four bottles of beer. By the time I returned to the living room the others had dragged three chairs out onto the front lawn. I grabbed another one (nice of them to think of me) and sat down next to Siobhan before passing the drinks around. \u0027So, how are you enjoying yourself here?\u0027 Siobhan asked the alien. Although she was sitting just inches away from me she had managed to angle herself so that all I could see was her back. \u0027Are you getting used to being here yet?\u0027 I watched John the alien and smiled inwardly as he struggled to open his bottle of beer with those long, slender fingers. Siobhan reached across, took the drink and did it for him. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t say I\u0027m enjoying it,\u0027 he answered, sniffing and cautiously sipping his beer. \u0027It\u0027s adequate for now.\u0027 He shuffled in his seat, looking distinctly uncomfortable. His body was too long for the seat. \u0027Looking forward to getting back?\u0027 \u0027Of course I am.\u0027 \u0027You must miss home,\u0027 Siobhan continued. \u0027I do,\u0027 he replied. \u0027I knew I was going to be away for a long time, but this is going to take much longer than any of us expected.\u0027 \u0027So what exactly happened?\u0027 I asked. \u0027What? Happened when?\u0027 \u0027When you were out there on your ship. I can\u0027t imagine what could have happened to cripple something as big and complex as your ship.\u0027 \u0027We were mining minerals in an asteroid field and we were hit by debris.\u0027 \u0027Debris!\u0027 I exclaimed. \u0027Fucking hell, must have been a bloody big bit of debris to do so much damage.\u0027 He fixed his baby-blue eyes on mine. \u0027It was.\u0027 His voice was icy cold and devoid of all emotion. Although I had no way of knowing whether the aliens normally used the same expression and intonation in their voices as we did, I sensed that was his way of telling me to piss off. While I stared at the alien and wished that he would fuck off back to wherever it was that he had come from, Rob and Siobhan continued to bombard him with a barrage of questions. \u0027So how did you feel when you stepped out of the ship?\u0027 Siobhan wondered. \u0027What were your first impressions?\u0027 \u0027First impressions of what?\u0027 \u0027Of everything. What did you think of the planet, our cities, our people?\u0027 He thought carefully for a few moments and finished his beer. He was drinking at an impressive speed. I had only just started mine. \u0027If I\u0027m honest,\u0027 he began, \u0027arriving here was a very strange experience.\u0027 \u0027Strange?\u0027 I asked. \u0027In what way?\u0027 He thought again before replying. \u0027Strange in that being here is like being in a living history book. There are some major differences between our planets and our people, but generally your technology and way of living is similar to the standards we had on our planet a considerable time ago...\u0027 \u0027When you say considerable,\u0027 I interrupted, \u0027just how long are we talking about?\u0027 \u0027You are about three hundred years behind us.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re that far ahead?\u0027 Siobhan gasped. \u0027We\u0027re that far behind?\u0027 I mumbled. He nodded. \u0027Approximately.\u0027 A moment of silence passed while we all individually stopped to consider the alien\u0027s apparent superiority over our race. \u0027So what did you do on your ship?\u0027 Rob asked, effortlessly restarting a conversation which I silently hoped had finished. \u0027I worked in the Storage and Gradation team. I looked after the machines that graded the ore before it was passed to the refinery.\u0027 \u0027The refinery?\u0027 I said, surprised. \u0027Bloody hell, just what did you do on that ship? I thought you just mined for whatever it was you needed and transported it back to your planet.\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027Because we\u0027d used up pretty much all of our planet\u0027s resources we had to start mining further and further afield. And because of the length of time it took us to travel to these places, we prepared the ore en route so that it was ready for use when we got back home. That also avoided polluting the planet with the by-products of our operations.\u0027 \u0027So you just polluted space instead?\u0027 I snapped. He nodded again. \u0027That\u0027s right.\u0027 \u0027So how did you do it? How did you mine? Did you have machines with hammers and pickaxes or...?\u0027 \u0027We took most of our minerals from asteroids and small moons. We\u0027d locate the source, attach the ship to it and then extract whatever it was that we needed to take.\u0027 \u0027You mined asteroids?\u0027 Rob asked, his eyes like saucers. \u0027Jesus, how dangerous is that?\u0027 \u0027Dangerous enough to mean that I\u0027m sitting here with you tonight,\u0027 he replied. \u0027The asteroid we were working on had an undetected flaw. Our machines tapped into the wrong place and the whole mass disintegrated.\u0027 \u0027Disintegrated?\u0027 I pressed. \u0027Exploded,\u0027 he explained. \u0027That\u0027s where the debris I was talking about came from. It damaged the engines and breached the hull.\u0027 I nodded and thought for a second. \u0027So where exactly did you stand on board?\u0027 I then asked. He didn\u0027t answer immediately - did he think I was asking where he physically stood on the ship? I elaborated. \u0027There are about three hundred and seventy of you here, right?\u0027 \u0027Correct.\u0027 \u0027So how far up in the chain of command are you? Do you sit at the captain\u0027s table or are you...?\u0027 \u0027Am I what?\u0027 \u0027Bottom of the heap?\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027We don\u0027t have rankings as such in our society, there isn\u0027t any need. I was trained to do my job and I did it to the best of my abilities, as did the pilots, the technicians and the maintenance staff.\u0027 \u0027So who\u0027s fault was it that your ship got damaged?\u0027 \u0027No-one\u0027s fault. It was a freak accident.\u0027 \u0027Shouldn\u0027t you have been prepared for freak accidents if you were all so highly trained and effective?\u0027 I was conscious that both Rob and Siobhan were glaring at me but I wasn\u0027t interested in anything they felt or had to say. I wasn\u0027t particularly interested in what the alien had to say either. I just found myself feeling particularly territorial and awkward. \u0027It was a freak accident,\u0027 he repeated quietly. I didn\u0027t believe him. How could they have been so advanced and yet have left themselves so exposed? Surely they must have had contingency plans and safety measures to prevent such accidents from happening? Or perhaps I was just being overly critical for no better reason that I didn\u0027t like this alien. Or any alien for that matter. More to the point, it wasn\u0027t that I didn\u0027t like them, it was just that I couldn\u0027t be bothered with them. I resented the fact that to everyone else I knew, these uninvited guests had suddenly become the be-all and end-all at the expense of absolutely everything else. \u0027Do you like what you do?\u0027 I wondered. Now I was the one asking the incessant stream of questions. \u0027There\u0027s no point liking or disliking it, is there?\u0027 he replied. \u0027It\u0027s what I was trained to do. It\u0027s what I always knew I would be doing. I know everything there is to know about my job...\u0027 \u0027And you know exactly how long you\u0027ll be doing it for, don\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right.\u0027 \u0027But don\u0027t you ever yearn to do anything else?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Haven\u0027t you ever looked at the bloke who lives next door to you and felt like you wanted to do what he does? Or have you ever liked the look of someone else\u0027s wife or house and...\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not even going to bother answering your questions. I\u0027ve already told you the answers.\u0027 \u0027Is there anyone you don\u0027t like?\u0027 I pressed. \u0027My race or alien?\u0027 he sneered. \u0027Your race,\u0027 I sneered back. \u0027Alien.\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027No-one.\u0027 \u0027Any one ever pissed you off?\u0027 \u0027Pissed me off?\u0027 \u0027Got on your nerves?\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re the first for a while.\u0027 \u0027Any of your kind?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027So you live in this perfect world where everyone gets on and there\u0027s no resentment and no discrimination and...\u0027 \u0027Give it a rest, Tom,\u0027 pleaded Siobhan. I ignored her. \u0027...and you all do everything for the good of everyone...\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s your point?\u0027 Rob butted in. \u0027My point is I find it hard to believe any of this bullshit.\u0027 \u0027Believe what you want to believe,\u0027 the alien said softly. \u0027The fact is it\u0027s true. We work together because it is the collective effort of each one of us that keeps the structure of our society intact. We are all equal.\u0027 \u0027Do you feel superior?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Superior to what?\u0027 \u0027Us.\u0027 He thought carefully for a moment, still staring at me with those piercing blue eyes. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said simply. Conceited bastard, I thought. I got up from my chair and went to fetch more beer. I could feel Rob and Siobhan\u0027s mood physically lift as I walked away. I guess that if I had been in the alien\u0027s shoes then I would have probably felt the same way about our backward society as he did. But this was my backward society and my home and I loved it. How dare he think himself above us? Technical knowledge and skill was not all that success and advancement was measurable by. What did his kind know about art and music and other, less regimented pursuits? I could hear the conversation continuing outside without me. \u0027So,\u0027 Rob asked, seemingly unaffected by my outburst and my exit, \u0027tell us more, will you? If everything\u0027s so structured back where you are, how do you deal with illnesses and accidents?\u0027 \u0027We don\u0027t have illnesses,\u0027 he replied. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve eradicated them all.\u0027 \u0027How?\u0027 \u0027Remember your computer revolution when the silicon chip was invented?\u0027 \u0027Yes, why?\u0027 Rob answered. \u0027That was a fundamental technological change that enabled a thousand other technologies to advance, wasn\u0027t it? About fifty years ago we entered a similar kind of phase on our planet.\u0027 \u0027How do you mean?\u0027 \u0027We made a discovery that changed everything.\u0027 \u0027What discovery?\u0027 \u0027We discovered how to take apart and reassemble the smallest atoms and electrons. We\u0027re able to modify them, control them, change them, rearrange them, destroy them, create them...\u0027 \u0027Jesus...\u0027 Siobhan whispered. \u0027And once you have the ability to do all of that,\u0027 the alien continued, \u0027you can look at everything in a new way. You\u0027re able to do just about anything.\u0027 \u0027Such as?\u0027 \u0027You mentioned medicine? We can now look at our bodies in a whole new light. We can break things down to the very lowest level imaginable. In the same way that you might repair a complicated computer network with a single new chip or a change of software, we can repair our bodies by forgetting about limbs and bones and organs and thinking in terms of individual cells.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t follow,\u0027 Siobhan mumbled, already feeling the effect of her first bottle of beer. \u0027A diseased cell was probably once a healthy cell, agree?\u0027 She nodded. \u0027Yeah...\u0027 \u0027So what we\u0027re able to do is reverse the process that caused the cell to become diseased. We can rearrange the component parts of the cell in order to return it to a healthy state. By learning the precise role of the smallest parts of even the smallest atoms of the smallest cells it\u0027s been possible for us to identify and isolate the base cause of every physical problem. And as our technology has continued to improve, so we\u0027ve been able to cure those problems and, eventually, prevent them from happening in the first place.\u0027 \u0027So what are you saying?\u0027 I asked, entering the room in much the same mood as I had been in when I had left. \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 the alien sighed, obviously tiring of me. \u0027Does this make you all powerful?\u0027 \u0027You could say that. There\u0027s very little that we can\u0027t do...\u0027 \u0027So why do you die?\u0027 \u0027Because it\u0027s part of the plan. There has to be progression.\u0027 \u0027Why bother? You all look the same, there doesn\u0027t seem to be much progression to me...\u0027 \u0027Bodies age...\u0027 \u0027So reverse the ageing process.\u0027 He shook his head. \u0027We have very strict ethics that control the use of this technology.\u0027 \u0027Are you controlled?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027You mention computers - you can erase a computer\u0027s memory and reprogram it. From what you say it sounds as if you\u0027re able to do that with your memories and brains.\u0027 \u0027The technology exists, yes.\u0027 \u0027So you could delete memories, change personalities, suppress emotions...\u0027 \u0027We could, but we don\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re programmed to tow the line, aren\u0027t you? You don\u0027t deviate from what you\u0027ve been ordained to do because you\u0027ve been programmed not to.\u0027 \u0027This is bollocks,\u0027 spat Rob. \u0027No it isn\u0027t,\u0027 I protested. \u0027Come on, can you tell me with any certainty that no-one\u0027s messed with your mind? Are you sure that you\u0027re not just a worker drone that\u0027s been sent out into space to do the work of who knows what?\u0027 \u0027It just wouldn\u0027t happen,\u0027 the visitor sighed. \u0027Listen to yourself, will you? You\u0027re talking about \u0027us\u0027 and \u0027them\u0027 all the time. In our society we only talk about us. Everything is done for the common good.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s all wrong,\u0027 I insisted. \u0027It\u0027s all fucking wrong. You\u0027re talking about a technology that allows you to control everything - even the most basic thought processes.\u0027 I noticed that Rob and Siobhan were looking at each other. They appeared awkward and uncomfortable. I felt frustrated and angry, but I wasn\u0027t completely sure why. I was getting nowhere and all it was doing was winding the others up. I got up, walked to the end of the garden and stared out over the calm, dark sea. A brisk, cold wind blew in from the coast and chilled me to the core. The things that I had heard that evening rattled round and round my head for hours. I couldn\u0027t sleep. Siobhan lay in bed with her back to me, sleeping soundly. I had really pissed her off with my behaviour tonight. She hadn\u0027t spoken to me since the alien had left the house just after midnight. I just couldn\u0027t accept what I\u0027d been told. The alien had asked us to believe that he came from some utopian paradise billions of miles away - a place where people lived predestined lives without question or complaint; a place where individuals worked together selflessly for the common good. Someone once said that we only see things from our own perspective. I could only base my judgement on what I knew of myself and the rest of the human race, and that experience made me doubt that this paradise could ever have existed. What about character and personality? What about creativity and spontaneity? None of those qualities could possibly have been allowed to exist on the alien homeworld. Such attributes would only serve to disturb the precious status quo. If what I had heard was true then the options were limited. Either this place was a shining example to the rest of the universe, a cold, anodyne hell that no-one in their right minds would want anything to do with, or it was simply the most dangerous mind-fuck in existence. My gut reaction was that this alien \u0027John\u0027 and the rest of his blissfully happy species were being controlled like puppets by some godlike being who\u0027s purpose I didn\u0027t even want to think about.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-17.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
