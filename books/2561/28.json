{"id":112207,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"It was half-past six. As I fastened up my coat and shivered in the icy-cool air of early morning I walked to the end of Clare\u0027s short drive and looked up and down the street. It was deserted. No doubt those people who were still capable of functioning rationally were curled up in fear deep inside their homes waiting for whatever was going to happen next. My car\u0027s remote central locking wasn\u0027t working. I tried the key in the lock and managed to open it manually. Once inside I quickly pulled the door shut and started the engine. Nothing. I checked the immobiliser, checked I had the right key and even checked that I was in the right car. I tried again. Nothing. It was completely dead. I looked back at Clare\u0027s house and could see her standing in the shadows of her living room, watching. I got out of the car and gestured for her to get out of sight. I didn\u0027t wait to see if she\u0027d understood, I just started to jog back towards the village and then, ultimately, home. I had no idea how I was going to reach Siobhan\u0027s house without the car. Maybe I could find a bike or something else to use so that I could... A sudden change in the light and shadow around me made me freeze. I looked up into the turbulent sky directly above me and watched in terrified awe as one of the immense alien ships carved a silent passage through the swirling clouds over my head, heading in the general direction of Thatcham. As it cruised powerfully forward, a bright opening appeared in its otherwise featureless belly and from it swooped a fleet of seventeen sleek, grey-silver shuttle crafts. As each one of the shuttles dropped down into the morning air a single pulse of brilliant white light appeared from their engines and they raced on ahead of the mother ship. Although the entire fleet was gone in seconds I knew that I couldn\u0027t afford to drop my guard. No matter where I was standing, I could always see at least one other alien ship somewhere in the sky. I had no option but to keep on moving towards home. I hoped that my insignificance would be my saviour on this bitter and desperate morning. The streets of the village were silent and dead. I had a thousand and one unanswerable questions spinning round my tired mind as I ran and then walked towards my house. Why was I the only person stupid enough to be out in the open? Where was everyone else? I searched pointlessly for the answers to the most serious questions of all - why were the alien ships here? There was no point in avoiding the obvious - this was a full scale invasion. But why? And how had it happened? I didn\u0027t get any comfort from knowing that my long held mistrust of the aliens had been well-founded. But Clare and I couldn\u0027t have been the only ones who\u0027d thought this way, could we? I took a right turn into Hope Street . Bloody ironic, I smiled to myself. \u0027Hey, you...\u0027 a voice hissed from out of nowhere. I span around quickly, looking for whoever it was who had spoken. The back doors of a inconspicuous-looking transit van slowly opened outwards. \u0027Who\u0027s there?\u0027 I whispered. From out of the shadows of the van a small and very slight young woman appeared. Perhaps aged between twenty and twenty-five, she looked exhausted and dishevelled. She began to get out of the van. I gestured for her to go the other way and climbed in with her. \u0027What\u0027s your name?\u0027 she asked quietly. \u0027Tom Winter,\u0027 I replied. \u0027I\u0027m Bhindi, Bhindi Shah,\u0027 she croaked, her throat dry. I pulled the door closed behind me. \u0027What\u0027s happening, Tom?\u0027 she sobbed. She must have known that I couldn\u0027t answer her. \u0027Don\u0027t know. How long have you been here?\u0027 It was dark and cramped inside the van. In the low light I could just about make out a blanket, a pillow, some clothes and the remains of a little food scattered around. \u0027I slept here last night,\u0027 she explained. \u0027I\u0027ve been staying with my aunt and uncle just over the road for the last few days and...\u0027 \u0027And?\u0027 \u0027And last night Uncle started going ballistic. He was shouting and screaming and throwing things around. Aunty started to do the same and then my cousins and I just had to get out...\u0027 \u0027Have you seen them this morning?\u0027 She nodded. \u0027I went back about an hour ago. They were all just sat there, not saying or doing anything. I tried to get some help but I couldn\u0027t find anyone. I was walking round for ages but I couldn\u0027t find anyone...\u0027 \u0027I understand,\u0027 I interrupted. \u0027You do know that it\u0027s not just your family this is happening to, don\u0027t you?\u0027 \u0027I know that.\u0027 Bhindi looked past me and out of the window behind me. I turned and saw that another alien ship was soaring through the sky perilously close to where we were hiding. \u0027What do they want?\u0027 she asked. \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 I replied truthfully. \u0027I wish they would just fuck off,\u0027 she spat. \u0027Fuck off and leave us. I never wanted them here anyway.\u0027 \u0027You and me both,\u0027 I mumbled under my breath. \u0027Look, I can\u0027t stop here. I\u0027m going back into Thatcham to fetch my brother then I\u0027m going back to my friend\u0027s house. If you want to come with me then...\u0027 She shook her head. \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Sure?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not going any further into the village. You\u0027re a fucking fool if you do.\u0027 \u0027Why do you say that?\u0027 \u0027Those bloody aliens,\u0027 she hissed. \u0027The place will be full of them.\u0027 I turned back to look out of the window again. What if she was right? In any event, did it matter? I had to go back to try and find Rob and Siobhan. If the village really was crawling with aliens then I would just have to take my chances with them. I didn\u0027t have any choice. I couldn\u0027t turn back without having tried to reach Siobhan. If something happened to me along the way then so be it. It was a chance I knew I was going to have to take. \u0027Are you sure you\u0027re going to stay here?\u0027 I asked again, just in case. \u0027Sure,\u0027 she replied. \u0027I want to stay close to my family.\u0027 I nodded and made my move. I crawled carefully out of the van. \u0027Take care of yourself,\u0027 I said quietly. Bhindi nodded and snuggled down under a blanket in the far corner of the van just behind the front passenger seat. I slammed the door shut, looked around anxiously, and then carried on walking. I didn\u0027t see or hear another soul in all the time I was out there. If they\u0027d wanted to I was sure the aliens could have taken me out. I was obviously of very little concern to them. It helped to put things into perspective - what could a single man do against an invading force of such vast and unprecedented power? As my confidence increased, so did my speed. I ran towards home.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-28.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
