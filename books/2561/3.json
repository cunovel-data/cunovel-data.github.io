{"id":112182,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"I sprinted down from the cold and exposed hillside and then tripped and stumbled through the rain-soaked streets of the village. The holiday season was almost over and the summer crowds had begun to subside. There seemed to have been more tourists than ever this year but now only a determined minority of the annual sun-seeking invasion force remained.\\n\\n I ran down the main promenade and followed the cobbled street which ran parallel with the curve of the shingle beach. There was a long and irregular line of shuffling figures gathered along the arc of the grey sea wall. They were all stood with their backs to me, every last one of them staring out over the ocean and out towards the dark horizon. Families stood together in bright waterproofs talking, for once, to the normally insular and reticent locals. It was obvious that they\u0027d all seen the same incredible sight that I\u0027d just witnessed. No-one could have missed it. Even though I was only there for a few breathless seconds, I could sense a peculiar unease and uncertainty hanging in the air. The locals, the tourists and myself were united in the fact that none of us had a bloody clue what had just happened.\\n\\n The heavy black clouds had smothered the afternoon with a murky darkness. I glanced up the hill towards home and could see my cottage. Bright yellow electric light was shining out from the living room and, standing in the window, I could see Robert\u0027s silhouette. He too was staring out towards the horizon hoping to catch sight of the awesome thing (whatever it was) that had silently flown by a couple of minutes earlier.\\n\\n I took another deep breath of damp, electrically-charged air and followed the road round the hairpin bend and then up towards the cottage. The final hill usually hurt more than any other part of my run. I was so preoccupied thinking about what I\u0027d seen that I didn\u0027t even notice the pain.\\n\\n \u0027Fucking hell, Tom!\u0027 Rob yelled as I crashed clumsily through the front door. \u0027Did you see it?\u0027 For a few seconds I couldn\u0027t breathe, let alone speak. I swallowed, slowly lifted my head and nodded. Coughing to clear my throat, I stumbled into the kitchen to get a drink.\\n\\n \u0027I saw it,\u0027 I managed to gasp between breaths.\\n\\n \u0027And?\u0027 he pressed, obviously keen for me to expand.\\n\\n \u0027And what?\u0027 I replied, still struggling to force enough oxygen into my body to prevent me from passing out. Now that I\u0027d finished the effort and pace of the final mile of my run was starting to hit home.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 Rob continued, oblivious to my suffering, \u0027what do you think it was? Where the hell did it come from?\u0027\\n\\n I shrugged my sweat-soaked shoulders and peeled off my sodden T-shirt. I leant against the nearest unit for support, kicked off my muddy trainers and looked up at my brother and shook my head.\\n\\n \u0027You tell me,\u0027 I mumbled, still finding it difficult to talk. He walked away and I slowly followed him back into the living room.\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t believe it,\u0027 he babbled excitedly, \u0027I mean, for bloody years we\u0027ve been talking and dreaming about something like this happening and now it has. More than that, it\u0027s happened here! Christ, the most important event in the history of bloody history itself and we\u0027re smack bang in the middle of it!\u0027\\n\\n I really did want to match Rob\u0027s obvious enthusiasm and excitement but at that moment in time it was impossible. I had a thousand and one questions running through my tired brain but I didn\u0027t have the energy to even try and answer any of them. My mind was willing, but my body was most definitely still weak.\\n\\n \u0027I was in the kitchen when I heard the jets,\u0027 he continued regardless. \u0027I heard them fly over and I came in here to see what was going on. I thought we\u0027d gone to war or something and then I saw it. Bloody hell, it flew right over the village! It must have been a couple of miles long...\u0027\\n\\n Robert didn\u0027t stop talking but I stopped listening. I walked across to the wide bay window on the far side of the room and, dressed only in my shorts and muddy socks, I looked out towards the horizon and then down onto the busy village below. The streets which had been relatively empty for much of the day were suddenly teeming with figures and there was still a decent sized crowd gathered by the sea wall. The storm was finally passing and moving out to sea and as the heavy clouds began to creep away the low light of the afternoon gradually began to improve.\\n\\n \u0027So what was it?\u0027 I asked, inadvertently cutting across my brother and repeating his earlier question. I hadn\u0027t actually meant to ask it, I was just thinking out loud.\\n\\n \u0027For Christ\u0027s sake,\u0027 Rob sighed, \u0027what do you think it was?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think it was a spaceship,\u0027 I muttered, unable to think of a more impressive way of describing the most incredible sight I (or anyone else) had ever witnessed. \u0027But it can\u0027t have been. That\u0027s ridiculous.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why is it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why is that ridiculous?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A spaceship?! Come on, we don\u0027t...\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve been sending people out into space for decades, haven\u0027t we? If we can do it then...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But nothing. Just accept it, Tom, this afternoon we were visited by bloody aliens!\u0027\\n\\n Regardless of what I knew I\u0027d seen, the reality was too incredible to believe.\\n\\n \u0027Aliens? Fucking hell, there\u0027s no way that...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what was it then?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. It could have been a prototype for a new type of plane or an airship or something like that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bollocks,\u0027 he snapped.\\n\\n I knew he was right but I still instinctively tried to find an alternative explanation. It just sounded so damn implausible. I mean, aliens and spaceships for Christ\u0027s sake? And anyway, why would any alien in its right mind choose to make its debut appearance here out in the back-end of nowhere on a miserable Friday afternoon?\\n\\n \u0027Thousands of people must have seen it,\u0027 Rob continued. \u0027There\u0027s no way the authorities can try and keep this quiet, is there? They\u0027re not going to be able to come up with a good enough story to cover this up. How can they expect...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bloody hell, be quiet will you?\u0027 I snapped. My brother was getting on my nerves. Whenever he became excited he would talk incessantly, and that really pissed me off because my natural reaction was to do the opposite - I just wanted to shut up and concentrate and try and make some sense of what was happening. I switched on the television and sat on the floor in front of the screen.\\n\\n \u0027Jesus...\u0027 Robert whispered as he sat down on the sofa behind me.\\n\\n \u0027It doesn\u0027t look like they\u0027re even going to bother trying to hush it up, does it?\u0027 I said.\\n\\n Virtually every channel carried the same picture - a direct live feed from the bobbing deck of a boat which swayed and rocked with the waves of the sea some fifty miles off the coast. The unsteady camera work revealed the huge ship we had seen in all its dark glory. Enormous and impervious, it hovered silently hundreds of feet above the restless water. A fleet of boats were dotted around the scene. Countless helicopters and planes buzzed and fluttered relentlessly through the swirling skies on all sides of the mighty craft. When one of the helicopters flew towards the camera from close to the hull of the ship its relative insignificance made the massive machine\u0027s vast proportions instantly and incredibly apparent. The camera pulled back again to show more of the ragtag flotilla of cruisers, ferries, tugs and other ships (most obviously military, others apparently more industrial in their design) that had gathered in the shadows of the mysterious titanic.\\n\\n \u0027I just don\u0027t believe this,\u0027 Robert mumbled under his breath. \u0027They\u0027re here. They\u0027re actually here...\u0027\\n\\n I had given up trying to shut Robert up and I turned up the sound to try and compensate. The unsure voice of an obviously dumbfounded commentator was speaking.\\n\\n \u0027...just to remind you that for the time being we\u0027ll be staying with this live coverage,\u0027 the woman\u0027s voice said, \u0027and to repeat once again that these are genuine pictures. This is not a hoax.\u0027 I looked over my shoulder. Robert had a dumb, childish grin plastered across his face. I turned back and continued to stare into the screen, hypnotised by a combination of bewilderment, disbelief, nervousness and utter amazement.\\n\\n It was one of those life-defining moments.\\n\\n Like watching the Gulf wars kicking off live on TV.\\n\\n Like watching the space shuttle explode in the sky.\\n\\n Like hearing that the princess had died in the tunnel.\\n\\n Like watching the World Trade Centre collapse after the terrorist strikes.\\n\\n I knew that nothing was ever going to be the same again.\\n\\n A stream of information ran across the bottom of the television screen which read; \u0027Confirmed arrival of alien ship. First official word from the Government due shortly. Downing Street spokesman advises population to remain calm. No evidence of hostility...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Can you imagine what Dad would have made of all of this,\u0027 Rob whispered. I nodded and smiled. My brother\u0027s fervour and wonder would have paled into insignificance next to that of our dad. He had been a keen kitchen-sink scientist and amateur astronomer for as long as I could remember. He\u0027d always seemed to be more interested in what was happening in space than in his own home and I would have given anything to have had him sitting next to me and watching the television now. He would have been so bloody excited. It all would have meant so much to him.\\n\\n \u0027So what do you think the politicians are going to say?\u0027 Rob asked.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 I replied. \u0027You would have expected them to try and play things down but I don\u0027t see how they can now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because so many people have seen so much, that\u0027s why. They\u0027ve got to come clean and tell us everything they know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Everything?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well they\u0027ve got to make the population believe that they\u0027ve been told everything, haven\u0027t they? They\u0027ll do more harm than good if they don\u0027t. The more they tell us, the less there is for people to make up for themselves. And the less people make up the...\u0027\\n\\n The picture of the ship on the television screen disappeared and was replaced by a news reader\u0027s face. The Government\u0027s announcement was imminent. The speed of events only served to emphasise the potential gravity and scale of our situation. For me the appearance of the first grey-suited politician on the screen instantly took away the edge of excitement and replaced it with a sobering degree of nervous uncertainty. I sensed that the words I was about to hear would set an important tone. Any hostility or fear in the diplomat\u0027s voice would indicate that our safety was not as guaranteed as we might naively have presumed in the bewilderment of the afternoon.\\n\\n The official walked towards a speaker\u0027s plinth and as he did so he was showered with a relentless stream of light from a hundred camera flashes. He paused for a second to collect himself and then cleared his throat before speaking. \u0027Earlier this morning,\u0027 he began, his voice initially unsteady, \u0027various observatories and scientific outposts around the world and in space were made aware of the presence of an unidentified object on the outskirts of our solar system. As the progress of this object was tracked it changed course several times before finally heading towards Earth.\u0027 He paused for a moment and shuffled awkwardly from foot to foot. \u0027Although no direct contact has been made as yet, the ship has broadcast a continual signal which, to all intents and purposes, seems to be a distress transmission.\u0027\\n\\n A second pause, this time long enough to allow the assembled reporters to fire off a volley of desperate questions at the politician while their associated photographers launched another barrage of flashes. The defenceless spokesman lifted his hands in an attempt to restore some order.\\n\\n \u0027The ship has been led away from land and is currently holding a position some fifty miles from the east coast of England . No resistance was offered to the armed air escort which guided it out over the ocean and, despite continual attempts, no contact has been made with whoever, or whatever, is piloting it. There\u0027s really nothing more I can tell you at the present time...\u0027\\n\\n As the spokesman was hit with another barrage of camera flashes and questions I stood up and walked over to the window again. There were still flurries of activity in the village streets below. It had stopped raining and the crowds around the sea wall remained. They seemed surprisingly happy and relaxed. Even from a distance I could see that there was a surprisingly calm and peaceful atmosphere in Thatcham.\\n\\n I could identify with the people outside. Strange and pretentious as it might have sounded, each one of them was suddenly a friend and an ally. The unexpected arrival of a new and previously unknown life form to the planet already seemed to have made the indigenous human population subconsciously bond closer together. I could see it happening everywhere I looked. People were standing and talking and laughing with people they wouldn\u0027t have even looked at yesterday. Already there were no longer black people and white people or Muslims and Christians and Jews or men and women or upper class and working class. There were just people.\\n\\n \u0027Where do you think Dad would be now?\u0027 Rob asked. I glanced over at him sitting cross-legged on the sofa. He had a deadly combination of concentration, fascination and excitement fixed on his face. If I half-closed my eyes I could see a five year-old Robert watching Star Wars, not a twenty-four year-old watching footage of man\u0027s first confirmed contact with an alien intelligence. I half expected Dad to come into the room.\\n\\n \u0027Knowing what he was like,\u0027 I eventually replied, \u0027he\u0027d either be out there on a boat trying to get as close as he could or he\u0027d still be up in the attic trying to find his binoculars.\u0027\\n\\n Rob laughed.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d go for the boat,\u0027 he smiled. \u0027He\u0027d have been first on the scene.\u0027\\n\\n I\u0027d have given anything for him to have been there watching the world change with us.\\n\\n Cold and shivering, I forced myself to move and dragged my tired body into the bathroom. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-3.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
