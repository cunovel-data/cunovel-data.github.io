I felt as if we should have been sprinting and running for our lives but there wasn\u0027t any apparent point or, bizarrely, anything much to run from. The aliens were still very visible in the skies over our heads for sure but, fortunately, that was where they seemed to be staying for the time being. Instinctively we still took care to keep ourselves hidden as much as possible. We walked in the shadows of hedges and fences as often as we could, hoping that we would soon find the winding coast road.\\n\\n The day now moving towards its end had been so long and painful that it felt as though weeks, not hours had passed by. All that had happened today seemed so ludicrous, far-fetched and unreal and yet, in a peculiar way, the lost normality of the life I\u0027d lost seemed even stranger than the twisted present. I guess it was because I knew there was no going back. Everything I had classed as normal before was now gone forever.\\n\\n I was conscious that Clare was beginning to tire and lag behind.\\n\\n \u0027You all right?\u0027 I asked, turning round to face her. I struggled to keep my voice at a volume that was sufficiently low and yet which could still be heard over the howling wind. She nodded.\\n\\n \u0027Fine,\u0027 she grunted.\\n\\n Yet another enormous ship powered overhead. We both stopped moving instantly and pressed our bodies tight against the brittle hedgerow which ran alongside us. No matter what we had been told, instinct forced us both to try and get out of sight when the aliens were close. The massive machines were so quick, powerful and quiet that we had no way of knowing when one was nearby until we saw it like this, vast and impervious. Once it had gone I gently pushed Clare forward again.\\n\\n \u0027We must be close to the road now,\u0027 I whispered. My breath condensed in cool clouds around my mouth. My face felt battered and raw in the cold autumn air.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve been saying that for the last half-hour,\u0027 Clare hissed. \u0027Still think we\u0027re heading in the right direction?\u0027\\n\\n I shrugged my shoulders and swapped the heavy holdall from my left to right hand.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 I replied truthfully.\\n\\n \u0027Still think we\u0027re doing the right thing?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 I said again. \u0027Do you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not sure.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Got to have been better than just sitting there and waiting for something to happen though?\u0027 I suggested. Who was I fooling? At that moment I would have given anything to have been sitting back in Clare\u0027s dark house again. It seemed the easiest option but I knew there was no going back.\\n\\n It began to pour with rain. It had been spitting since we\u0027d set out but this was much worse. A cold, hard downpour. Icy, relentless and showing no signs of stopping. There were low, heavy clouds all around us.\\n\\n \u0027Fucking hell,\u0027 Clare cursed. She stopped walking.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you think\u0027s the matter?\u0027 she snapped. \u0027Fucking hell, Tom, I\u0027m cold, I\u0027m frightened and now I\u0027m fucking wet. What in God\u0027s name are we doing out here?\u0027\\n\\n She wiped dribbles of water from her face and stood and stared at me. I stared back. Her body was haunched forward, and it seemed as though everything required more effort than she could muster. \u0027Come on,\u0027 I insisted, trying to calm and reassure her. \u0027The road\u0027s not far ahead now. All we need to do is...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is what? What\u0027s the point? What are we going to achieve?\u0027\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t argue and I couldn\u0027t answer. I felt as dejected, empty and frightened as she obviously was. I turned my back on her and walked away. It was easier than trying to reason with her.\\n\\n \u0027Just keep moving,\u0027 I shouted. \u0027The aliens aren\u0027t interested in us. We\u0027ll be all right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But what about the others?\u0027 she yelled back at me angrily. \u0027What about Penny? I don\u0027t know where my little girl is. I\u0027m out here with you, walking through the countryside in the middle of the fucking night, and my daughter\u0027s out there somewhere on her own. I should be with her.\u0027\\n\\n I shook my head and kept going.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s no point.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why not?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just trust me, will you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But I want to see her, Tom. I want to go back to the village and see if I can find...\u0027\\n\\n I stopped walking and turned around to face her again.\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s no point,\u0027 I repeated.\\n\\n \u0027But why?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because...\u0027\\n\\n At the last second I stopped myself from telling her about the cull. I couldn\u0027t bring myself to break the news to her. She still believed that Penny was alive and I didn\u0027t want to be the one to shatter her illusion. I was sure she knew in her heart that she wouldn\u0027t see her little girl again, but if she admitted to herself that Penny was gone she wouldn\u0027t have any reason to keep moving.\\n\\n Like a coward I just kept walking. I turned my back on her again and kept walking.\\n\\n \u0027Tom!\u0027 she screamed after me. \u0027Tom! Come back you bastard!\u0027\\n\\n I ignored her and walked, hoping that she would follow. Almost a minute had passed before I heard her footsteps at my side again.\\n\\n \u0027Just trust me, Clare,\u0027 I whispered, wiping drops of rain and tears of frustration from my eyes. \u0027Please just stay with me.\u0027\\n\\n Clare said nothing.\\n\\n The hedgerow we were following gradually grew taller and taller. I stopped for a second when something caught my eye. Dense and tangled for the most part, there were other parts where the hedge seemed thinner and almost passable. Crouching down on my hands and knees in the mud, I pushed my head and shoulders through at one of the thinnest points. \u0027What is it?\u0027 Clare asked from behind me.\\n\\n \u0027The road,\u0027 I grinned, standing up again.\\n\\n \u0027Which road?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Haven\u0027t got a fucking clue. But it\u0027s a road, and that\u0027s all that matters. I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll recognise it if we follow it for a while.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re completely sure?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not completely sure, no. But...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Christ, Tom,\u0027 she moaned. \u0027I\u0027m sick and tired of...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Listen,\u0027 I said quickly, covering her mouth with a muddy hand and silencing her. \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter what fucking road this is, the point is we\u0027ve found it. We\u0027ve been travelling in the right direction and we\u0027ve found a road. If this isn\u0027t the road I was thinking of, then there\u0027s a bloody good chance that this is the road that will take us to it. Understand?\u0027\\n\\n I dropped my hand away to give her a chance to respond.\\n\\n \u0027I just want to stop walking,\u0027 she whined. \u0027I\u0027m cold and I\u0027m tired and I\u0027m scared. I...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shh...\u0027 I soothed, pulling her closer to me. \u0027Let\u0027s just get down there and see where we end up.\u0027\\n\\n I slid the holdall over to the gap in the hedgerow and kicked it through, listening out for the heavy thump as it hit the tarmac. It sounded as if there was a drop of a few feet from the bank down to the road. I took Clare\u0027s rucksack from her and pushed that through before doing the same with my own.\\n\\n Crouching down on my hands and knees, I shuffled backwards until my feet were through the hedge. I felt my way down the bank.\\n\\n \u0027Come on,\u0027 I whispered, looking up at Clare who stood watching me. \u0027Follow me and keep close. There\u0027s a bit of a drop from the field to the road but I\u0027ll help you down once you\u0027re through.\u0027\\n\\n She nodded. Once I was sure that she was ready to push her way through the hedgerow after me I scrambled down onto the road. Seconds later the soles of Clare\u0027s muddy boots followed me through. I grabbed her legs and guided her down.\\n\\n \u0027Got you,\u0027 I said quietly.\\n\\n I looked up and down the narrow, twisting lane.\\n\\n \u0027Well,\u0027 she asked, \u0027know where we are?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not sure,\u0027 I answered truthfully.\\n\\n \u0027Brilliant,\u0027 she sighed.\\n\\n We picked up our rucksacks and the sports bag and walked on. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-34.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
