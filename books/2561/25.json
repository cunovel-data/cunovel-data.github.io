My brain was struggling to cope with everything that was happening. I didn\u0027t know what I was supposed to say.\\n\\n \u0027Are you okay?\u0027 I eventually mumbled, my voice wavering and cracked with emotion and uncertainty.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 she replied in little more than a whisper.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s wrong?\u0027 I asked nervously, almost too scared to listen to her answer.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s Penny...\u0027 she began before stopping when the pain and tears took over. \u0027She\u0027s... I don\u0027t...\u0027\\n\\n She withered and collapsed in front of me, virtually falling into my arms, and I instinctively reached out and caught her. I hauled her back up onto her unsteady feet and she buried her head in my chest as she sobbed hysterically. I held her tightly, keen to let her know that I was there for her, but also because I was relieved to have found someone else who had not deteriorated into the same pathetic and sorry state as most of the rest of the population seemed to have done.\\n\\n \u0027Tell me what\u0027s happened,\u0027 I pressed gently as I walked her back towards the house. \u0027What\u0027s wrong?\u0027\\n\\n Clare looked up at me with red eyes filled with desperate, stinging tears. She sniffed and wiped her face.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s Penny,\u0027 she sighed.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter with her? Same as last night?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Worse.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Worse? How?\u0027\\n\\n I closed the door behind us and followed Clare into the living room. I sat down with her on the sofa.\\n\\n \u0027Last night,\u0027 she began, \u0027after I\u0027d spoken to you she just seemed to get worse and worse. I\u0027ve hardly had any sleep. I had to lock her in her room because...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Because what?\u0027\\n\\n She shook her head, tears running freely again. She couldn\u0027t bring herself to finish her sentence.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 I said, reaching out to hold her. My attempts to console and reassure her were failing pathetically. Even after all that had already happened I was still frightened and disturbed by news of Penny\u0027s condition. I tried to at least appear strong for Clare\u0027s sake.\\n\\n \u0027Can I see her?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n She nodded, stood and led me upstairs, holding my hand all the way. As we approached the door of the little girl\u0027s room she squeezed tighter and tighter.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve been sitting here for hours just listening,\u0027 she whispered, nodding towards a small area of the landing which was littered with empty coffee cups and other rubbish. She stopped, dried her eyes on the sleeve of her blouse, and then lifted her head to look at me. Her face was a picture of frozen fear and pain. She turned back to face the door, lifted her hand to open it, and then stopped, letting her hand fall away again.\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t...\u0027 she began. \u0027She\u0027s...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s what?\u0027\\n\\n Clare shook her head and sniffed back more tears.\\n\\n \u0027Nothing.\u0027\\n\\n She took a deep breath and pushed the door open. She moved to one side and gestured for me to go through.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027ll be okay,\u0027 I whispered as I passed her. She didn\u0027t believe me but she managed half a smile.\\n\\n I peered cautiously around the door into the little square bedroom. I couldn\u0027t see Penny at first. It was difficult to make out much. The light was low and the room looked as if it had been hit by a tornado.\\n\\n \u0027Is she okay?\u0027 Clare asked, trying to lean over my shoulder to see inside.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 I replied. \u0027I can\u0027t see her. Maybe she\u0027s...\u0027\\n\\n In one unexpected movement Penny appeared from behind the door and stopped in front of me, staring at me with dark eyes full of anger and inexplicable hate. Her sudden appearance and malevolence caught me off guard and I jumped back, almost tripping over Clare behind me. And then she moved. With the speed of a wild animal and the strength of someone ten times her size the little girl shoulder-charged me and sent me flying back out onto the landing. It took all my strength just to keep hold of her. As I dragged her back towards her room she spat and hissed and bit me. I threw her down onto her bed and then ran back and slammed the door behind me, feeling her slam into the other side just moments later. She was thumping on the wood, trying to get out. And she screamed. A fucking awful wail of a scream which paled into insignificance alongside the desperate cries of her heartbroken mother standing next to me.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s happened to her?\u0027 she demanded. \u0027Why is she doing this?\u0027\\n\\n I didn\u0027t answer. I couldn\u0027t answer. I locked the door, leant against the wall and slid down to the ground.\\n\\n The thumping and banging continued for another twenty minutes. When it finally stopped I crept back into the bedroom and found the little girl curled up in a ball underneath her bed, shaking. Stronger than a shiver but nowhere near as violent as a full-blown fit or convulsion, she was trembling from head to toe. She was breathing and her vital signs were okay but apart than that she didn\u0027t move or respond to me in any way. I didn\u0027t know what to do other than just leave her there until we\u0027d managed to fetch a doctor to her. I stood up and ushered Clare out of the room and then turned back to look at Penny once more. She was bruised, bloodied and exhausted. Her normally sparkling eyes were dull and clouded. She was just an empty shell. There didn\u0027t seem to be anything left of the beautiful little creature that I\u0027d taken out for a birthday treat just a couple of days ago.\\n\\n Clare and I quietly made our way back down to the living room where we spoke in hushed whispers.\\n\\n \u0027Is she going to be all right?\u0027 she asked.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 I replied honestly, shrugging my shoulders. \u0027Impossible for me to say. We need to get someone out to see her but...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s caused this?\u0027 she demanded, cutting across me.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. Look, Clare, have you been out today?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I\u0027ve been here with Penny all day, you know that. Why?\u0027\\n\\n I paused for a moment. After the trauma she was already having to deal with, could my friend cope with any more news?\\n\\n \u0027Because she\u0027s not the only one who\u0027s like this.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I told you last night that Joe Porter had been acting weird...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But he\u0027s a sixty year-old man and Penny\u0027s just a child for God\u0027s sake...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, but that\u0027s not all. Did I tell you about Siobhan?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 she mumbled, shaking her head.\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s hardly spoken to me since you and I went out together at the weekend.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why not?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Christ knows. She\u0027s screamed at me, shouted at me, ignored me and virtually accused me of having an affair with you just because we went out together on Penny\u0027s birthday.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n The disbelief on Clare\u0027s face was clear to see.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve just come from her house. I left her sitting on the sofa like she was in a fucking coma, just staring at the floor. And James and Stephanie were the same when I saw them earlier, and Ray Mercer from the pub says that his wife Brenda has...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what are you saying? Is it a fucking epidemic?\u0027\\n\\n I shrugged my shoulders and walked across the room to look out of the window. The street outside was deserted.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. To be honest I haven\u0027t really thought much about it. I had just assumed that Siobhan and Joe Porter were both off on one and I thought Penny must have picked something up from nursery...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But what about the rest of them?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 I mumbled again.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s got to be a virus or something doing the rounds, hasn\u0027t it? Last winter half the village went down with flu just before Christmas. Maybe that\u0027s it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Could be.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Mrs Conner\u0027s the same. Explains why she was so vile to me this morning.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027s Mrs Conner? I thought you said you hadn\u0027t been out?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She lives next door. She was out in her garden this morning. I saw her when I went out to put the dustbin out. I said good morning to her and she just started ranting and raving at me. No warning. Christ, she\u0027s over eighty years old and we\u0027ve never had a cross word in all the time I\u0027ve lived here but today...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what exactly did she do?\u0027 I asked, keen to know if this old lady\u0027s behaviour matched that of the other people I had come across.\\n\\n \u0027Like I said, I was just minding my own business and she started yelling at me. It was fuck this and fuck that, the kind of things you just wouldn\u0027t expect to hear from someone like that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The people I\u0027ve seen have either been like that or completely bloody catatonic. Siobhan went off the handle at me on the telephone but today I left her sitting there like a bloody cabbage. You know James\u0027 eldest? She said her mum and dad spent the night shouting at each other and this morning they haven\u0027t even got themselves dressed.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Christ, what about their baby?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I left the kids with next-door. You, James\u0027 neighbour and Ray Mercer are the only people I\u0027ve been able to have anything resembling a sensible conversation with so far today.\u0027\\n\\n Clare held her tired head in her hands and ran her fingers through her hair. I could see that she was trying to make sense of everything that was happening and, for the first time, so was I. So far I had spent the day moving from conflict to conflict to conflict and I hadn\u0027t actually stopped to try and understand what was going on. It was only now that I was able to take a step back that I began to think there might actually be more to the day\u0027s events than I had first thought. It had been all too easy to gloss over the reasons behind all that had happened as I had been preoccupied with each individual argument.\\n\\n \u0027What about Rob?\u0027 she asked.\\n\\n \u0027Haven\u0027t seen him all morning,\u0027 I answered. \u0027He went out before I got up.\u0027 After that there was silence.\\n\\n About ten minutes later Clare got up from her seat and picked up the telephone. She tried a few numbers - various family members, the doctor, Siobhan, my house - but predictably didn\u0027t get any answers. All that had happened was so sudden and inexplicable that my mood and feelings were swaying violently. One moment I felt complete and utter fear, helplessness and disorientation, the next nothing but disbelief.\\n\\n It was like a switch had been flicked.\\n\\n Numb and almost too afraid to move, we sat and waited for a reason to leave.\\n\\n During the long, slow hours that followed I tried to telephone my friends and family again. I couldn\u0027t get any answers using either Clare\u0027s phone or my mobile. It was only four o\u0027clock but it felt more like ten. The light outside was quickly fading. Clare drew the curtains and switched on a table lamp.\\n\\n \u0027Hungry?\u0027 she asked.\\n\\n I shook my head.\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Want a drink?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No thanks.\u0027\\n\\n She stood up and paced impatiently around the room before sitting down again, frustrated.\\n\\n \u0027You all right?\u0027 I asked instinctively. Bloody stupid question. Of course she wasn\u0027t all right.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m fine,\u0027 she sighed. \u0027The world\u0027s falling apart, I can\u0027t get anyone on the phone and my daughter\u0027s upstairs lying on her fucking bed like she\u0027s been fucking lobotomised. I\u0027m absolutely fucking fine! What about you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sorry,\u0027 I mumbled.\\n\\n She grunted and shook her head.\\n\\n \u0027Look, do you think we should...?\u0027\\n\\n The lights went out.\\n\\n \u0027Shit,\u0027 Clare hissed.\\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s your fuse-box?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n \u0027Cupboard under the stairs,\u0027 she replied as she felt her way across the room to stand next to me.\\n\\n I carefully made my way around the room with outstretched hands, using the walls and furniture to support and guide me. I eventually reached the front door, then the stairs, then the cupboard. The fuse hadn\u0027t tripped.\\n\\n I retraced my steps back through the shadows to the living room. \u0027Everything looks okay,\u0027 I said. \u0027Has this happened before?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027\\n\\n Clare was standing by the window. Although I couldn\u0027t see clearly what she was doing, I knew she was opening the curtains.\\n\\n \u0027Is it just us?\u0027 I asked.\\n\\n Even from where I was standing I could tell that it wasn\u0027t. The world outside was bathed in a total, inky darkness. I couldn\u0027t see even a single electric light out there. The houses nearby were dark. Every street light was dull and unlit.\\n\\n \u0027A power cut,\u0027 Clare hissed. \u0027Bloody hell, that\u0027s all we need.\u0027\\n\\n Instinctively I tried a few more electrical items although logic said that none of them would work. The television was dead, as was the stereo. Strangely, even the little battery powered radio which Clare kept in the kitchen seemed to have stopped working.\\n\\n \u0027What about the phone?\u0027 I wondered.\\n\\n \u0027No-one\u0027s answered the bloody thing all afternoon,\u0027 she snapped, \u0027what difference will it make?\u0027\\n\\n Begrudgingly she walked over to the phone, picked it up and then dropped it down again.\\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dead,\u0027 she sighed. \u0027Can\u0027t even get a dialling tone.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what do we do now?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you going to try and get back home?\u0027\\n\\n I thought for a moment. There didn\u0027t seem to be any point. There probably wouldn\u0027t be anyone there. On the other hand we could all have gone to my place, but I didn\u0027t like the idea of moving Penny in her current state.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll stay here with you if that\u0027s all right,\u0027 I said.\\n\\n \u0027Good,\u0027 she replied. \u0027You sure?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sure.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about your brother and Siobhan?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Should you try and get to them?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t know. I\u0027d rather stay here and sit tight. I know where Siobhan is and I haven\u0027t got a clue where Rob is. I\u0027d rather not take any chances tonight. We\u0027ll wait for the power to come back on and then we\u0027ll decide what to do next.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are we going to be safe here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Safe from what?\u0027 I replied rhetorically. Her question was logical but surprising and impossible to answer nonetheless. In the shadows and low light I saw her shrug her shoulders. She turned away from me to look out of the window.\\n\\n I crept upstairs to check on Penny a short time later. On my hands and knees (so that I didn\u0027t trip in the darkness and disturb her) I crawled into the bedroom. She was still lying under the bed where I had left her earlier. I gently pulled her out, lifted her surprisingly heavy frame and lay her on top of her covers. Her skin was cold and clammy. Even though her eyes were tightly closed, her face looked troubled and unnatural. Her innocent features were twisted and contorted with pain and confusion. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-25.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
