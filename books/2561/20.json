He and Rob had become quite close since they\u0027d met back in August but I just couldn\u0027t warm to him. It was more than the fact that he was an alien - there was something about him that I really didn\u0027t like. I had spoken to him on several occasions - once or twice at length - and we had discussed many different topics. We\u0027d talked about families, technology, homes, hobbies, sport and even war. Regardless of all that I\u0027d learned about him I still felt the same distrust and dislike today as I\u0027d felt the first time I\u0027d set eyes on the bastard.\\n\\n \u0027Where you been?\u0027 Rob grunted as I closed the front door and took off my jacket.\\n\\n \u0027Out with Clare, why?\u0027 \u0027Siobhan\u0027s been on the phone for you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, right. Does she want me to call her back or is she...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I think you should call her,\u0027 Rob said, cutting across me.\\n\\n \u0027Did she say whether she\u0027s...\u0027\\n\\n I stopped talking when the alien appeared in the hallway from the living room.\\n\\n \u0027Evening, Tom,\u0027 he said in his low, monotonous voice. He sounded like Mr Franks, the maths teacher who had made my life hell when I was thirteen. Maybe that was why I didn\u0027t like him?\\n\\n \u0027Evening,\u0027 I replied, my voice as curt and abrasive as I could make it sound with a single word.\\n\\n \u0027Had a good day?\u0027 he asked as he walked towards me.\\n\\n \u0027Fine,\u0027 I snapped as I neatly side-stepped him and went into the kitchen. What I\u0027d really wanted to say was \u0027it\u0027s none of your fucking business,\u0027 but I didn\u0027t.\\n\\n I glanced over my shoulder and, to my relief, saw that Rob and his friend were heading back towards the living room. I filled up the kettle and, as I waited for it to boil, I picked up the phone to speak to Siobhan.\\n\\n It rang out five or six times before she answered.\\n\\n \u0027Hello?\u0027 a quiet, distant voice said.\\n\\n \u0027Hi, it\u0027s me. How you doing?\u0027 I said, suddenly feeling more alive and awake than I had done all day.\\n\\n \u0027Do you give a damn how I\u0027m doing?\u0027\\n\\n For a second I could think of nothing to say.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 I eventually mumbled.\\n\\n \u0027I said do you give a fucking damn how I\u0027m doing?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course I do. Look, what\u0027s the...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think you do. Christ, it\u0027s been so long since you bothered to speak to me that I was starting to think you\u0027d forgotten I existed. Thought you\u0027d found someone better to spend you time with...\u0027\\n\\n There were such unexpected levels of anger, bitterness and unwarranted accusation in my girlfriend\u0027s voice that I found myself having real difficulty trying to respond.\\n\\n \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 I stammered. \u0027Of course I haven\u0027t forgotten about you. We went out on Wednesday, didn\u0027t we? I called you yesterday...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wasn\u0027t there.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That wasn\u0027t my fault.\u0027\\n\\n I frantically checked and rechecked over the events of the last few days in my mind to make sure I hadn\u0027t missed anything important. Her birthday was in April. It wasn\u0027t Christmas. It wasn\u0027t Valentine\u0027s Day. I was at a loss. But my memory had served me well. I had taken her to the pub on Wednesday night. We\u0027d had a bar meal and then stayed on for a few drinks.\\n\\n \u0027You should have called me again. You should have kept trying.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You could have called me,\u0027 I protested.\\n\\n \u0027I shouldn\u0027t have to.\u0027\\n\\n Again I struggled to comprehend the garbage that was coming from Siobhan\u0027s mouth. She was normally so calm and level-headed. We\u0027d been apart for longer recently, so why was she making such a fuss about the last few days in particular? I thought our relationship was stronger and more solid than that.\\n\\n \u0027Look,\u0027 I began, keen to hear some kind of explanation from her, \u0027I don\u0027t know what the matter is. Am I supposed to have done something? I was going to try and call you this afternoon but...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But what?\u0027 she demanded, interrupting. \u0027Couldn\u0027t you be bothered? Had you got something better to do? Something more important...?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No. Fucking hell, you\u0027re more important to me than anything else, you know that.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do I?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Of course you do. I love you.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Do you?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know I do. Look, have I done something wrong? Have I forgotten something I should have remembered? If I have then I\u0027m sorry, but...\u0027\\n\\n Rather than bother to listen to what I had to say, Siobhan instead chose to ignore me.\\n\\n \u0027Where were you this afternoon?\u0027 she asked, her voice cold and uncharacteristically stern.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come on, I asked you where you were this afternoon?\u0027 she repeated angrily. \u0027I know you weren\u0027t at home because I called you. And I didn\u0027t just call you once, I tried about fifteen fucking times and I still couldn\u0027t get an answer. I came over but the house was empty...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look, I...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where were you?\u0027 she screamed.\\n\\n She\u0027s lost it, I thought, completely lost the fucking plot. Why should I stand here and listen to this? Just because we were going out together didn\u0027t give her the right to know my every move.\\n\\n \u0027Does it matter where I\u0027ve been? I don\u0027t have to tell you everything I...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where were you?\u0027 she screamed again.\\n\\n Like a frightened school boy I answered quickly.\\n\\n \u0027I went to see Clare,\u0027 I snapped reluctantly. \u0027Is that all right with you or should I have checked first...?\u0027 \u0027What were you doing there?\u0027\\n\\n I took a deep breath. For a second I thought about just hanging up the phone but I knew that would have done more harm than good.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s Penny\u0027s birthday. I took her card and present over and I took them both out for a burger. Clare\u0027s having problems with...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Is there something going on between you two?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I said is there something going on between you two? She\u0027s a single woman now. If you didn\u0027t have anything to hide you would have told me you were taking her out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t take her out. Anyway it was a spur of the moment thing...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bollocks,\u0027 she spat. \u0027I know something\u0027s going on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ve got this all wrong,\u0027 I sighed. \u0027Clare\u0027s a good friend of ours...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027...of yours...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s a good friend of ours who happens to be going through a rough patch at the moment. I\u0027m not about to let her...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What about me?\u0027 demanded Siobhan, now screaming down the phone at me. \u0027What do you think I\u0027m going through? How the hell do you think I feel when I find out that my fucking boyfriend\u0027s seeing another fucking woman?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t talk rubbish,\u0027 I said, fighting a losing battle to keep calm. \u0027You know damn well that I\u0027d never cheat on you...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s what I used to believe.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what\u0027s happened to change your mind? I\u0027ve spent time with Clare before and never had any of this from you. What\u0027s different this time?\u0027\\n\\n She didn\u0027t answer. The empty silence was deafening. I could still hear faint sounds coming from the other end of the line so I knew she hadn\u0027t hung up. I looked around the kitchen helplessly as I waited for her to speak. I still couldn\u0027t comprehend the bizarre conversation we were having.\\n\\n \u0027You could\u0027ve asked me to come with you,\u0027 she sobbed suddenly.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve already told you, it was a spur of the moment thing. I went over to Clare\u0027s to drop in Penny\u0027s present and card. They were on their own and it was Penny\u0027s birthday and I decided to take them out. That\u0027s all there was to it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I was on my own.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You were at work. You told me you were shopping afterwards.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t. I came home early. I didn\u0027t feel well. Christ, do you know what you\u0027ve put me through today?\u0027 Her voice sounded hoarse and wracked with emotion. I hated it when she cried.\\n\\n \u0027Look,\u0027 I sighed, \u0027I\u0027m sorry.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n I cleared my throat and prepared to apologise again. Christ alone knows what I thought I was apologising for.\\n\\n \u0027I said I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 I repeated. \u0027Do you want me to come over?\u0027\\n\\n Silence.\\n\\n Then she spoke.\\n\\n \u0027I just don\u0027t believe you,\u0027 she said, her voice little more than a whisper.\\n\\n \u0027Shall I come over?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Just leave me alone. Just fuck off and leave me alone.\u0027\\n\\n She slammed down the phone.\\n\\n What had just happened? I couldn\u0027t get my head around any of it. I stood there for a while, just staring at the phone. When I\u0027d said goodbye to Siobhan on Wednesday we\u0027d kissed more passionately than ever. So passionately, in fact, that we almost ended up making love on her doorstep. And now, just a few days later, the same girl had accused me of cheating on her without having any evidence or any reason to doubt me. I couldn\u0027t believe that Siobhan - the one dependable and stable influence that there had been in my life recently - had turned on me like this. She had been friends with Clare for almost as long as I had and I found her sudden lack of faith in either of us incredible and painfully hard to comprehend.\\n\\n As far as I was aware, save for the unforgivable crime of not being at home to answer the telephone, I hadn\u0027t done anything wrong. Last Wednesday night had been perfect. We\u0027d left the pub hand in hand and had walked back to her house in the cool moonlight. With the distant satellite\u0027s silvery rays dancing and playing on the rippling waves of the ocean she had been the one who had commented on how perfect and romantic our evening had been. There hadn\u0027t been any indication of the venom and hostility so evident in her voice now.\\n\\n \u0027Everything okay?\u0027 Rob asked, startling me. \u0027I heard you shouting. Was that Siobhan?\u0027\\n\\n I nodded and pushed past him and headed for the living room.\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t realise you two were having problems,\u0027 he said, following close behind.\\n\\n \u0027Neither did I,\u0027 I grunted angrily. I was in no mood to talk.\\n\\n I walked into the living room where the alien was stood at the bay window, looking down on the dark village below. I had forgotten he was there. He was the last person I wanted to see, certainly the last person I wanted to speak to. I was about to turn and go to my bedroom when I stopped myself. No, I thought. This is my house. The living room was the warmest, most comfortable room and it was where I wanted to be. Why the hell should I go anywhere else?\\n\\n The alien turned round and looked at me before turning back to look out of the window again. \u0027So what\u0027s wrong?\u0027 Rob asked with genuine concern in his voice. \u0027What\u0027s happened?\u0027\\n\\n I didn\u0027t answer immediately. I didn\u0027t want to talk with the alien in the room. I wasn\u0027t even prepared to talk about the weather in his company and I was not about to share my private and personal problems while he was there. But at the same time there was no way I could avoid talking to Rob. It was obvious that he was worried.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 I mumbled. \u0027Haven\u0027t got a clue.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So what did she say?\u0027\\n\\n I shrugged my shoulders.\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s decided that I\u0027m having an affair.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027An affair? Who with?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Clare.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Clare!\u0027 he exclaimed, surprised. \u0027Bloody hell, that\u0027s ridiculous. For Christ\u0027s sake, the way she feels about men at the moment is enough to put anyone off.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not according to Siobhan it\u0027s not.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But you and Clare are just friends, same as me and Clare, same as Siobhan and Clare and me and Siobhan for that matter. So why does...?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re more than just friends, we\u0027re good, close friends. And when a good friend of mine is hurting I want to do something about it. So I did something today.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why today?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Penny\u0027s birthday, isn\u0027t it,\u0027 I said, my voice still quiet so our eavesdropping alien guest couldn\u0027t hear. \u0027Her ex let her down. Couldn\u0027t be bothered to turn up for his only daughter\u0027s birthday.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She\u0027s better off without him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s not the point.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You see, this is one of the things that I really have trouble understanding,\u0027 the alien said suddenly. I was angry that he\u0027d dared to listen to and then interrupt our private conversation. Rob, on the other hand, was encouraging him to join in.\\n\\n \u0027What don\u0027t you understand?\u0027 he wondered.\\n\\n \u0027How you could even consider changing from one partner to another. Back home it just wouldn\u0027t happen, not even if our partner died. There\u0027s never any question of...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I wish you\u0027d just fuck off home,\u0027 I spat, incensed. \u0027You come here with your bloody holier-than-thou attitude and then stick your nose into my business uninvited. Do yourself a favour and do me a favour and fuck off!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Tom,\u0027 Rob protested uselessly. \u0027Come on, he was only...\u0027\\n\\n I stormed out of the room and slammed the door behind me. All I wanted was an explanation. I felt empty and hollow. I loved Siobhan. I would have done anything for her. Christ, I would have taken a bullet for her. I thought she knew just how much she meant to me and I thought she knew how I felt. So why was she so hostile towards me? Had it really been that insensitive of me to have taken Clare and Penny out?\\n\\n I sat alone in the darkest, quietest corner I could find and listened to the silence.\\n\\n I loved her and I wanted her close. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-20.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
