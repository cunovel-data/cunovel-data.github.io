{"id":112190,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"On Saturday evening Siobhan, Rob and I along with James, his wife Stephanie and their four children, all gathered by invitation at Clare and Penny\u0027s house. Clare had told me many times during the last few weeks and months that she hated spending her evenings alone and these informal get-togethers had recently become a regular event. A chance for us all to relax in the company of our closest friends.\n Fortunately the late summer evening was warm and bright and we were able to send the children outside to play - out of sight and out of earshot. Once they had disappeared we were, for a short time, able to relax without interruption. I lay back on Clare\u0027s comfortable sofa with Siobhan\u0027s head resting on my chest. Music played quietly in the background and long orange shadows filled the room.\n \u0027See the ship leave last night, Clare?\u0027 Rob asked. James was close to Stephanie (with their baby asleep in her arms) and Siobhan and I were most definitely sitting together. As one of the two single adults in the room, Rob seemed to feel duty bound to try and strike up a conversation with Clare. Often it was harder to stop a conversation with her, but tonight she seemed tired and reticent.\n \u0027No,\u0027 she sighed, shaking her head. \u0027Couldn\u0027t be bothered. Penny watched some of the pictures on the television this morning.\u0027\n \u0027We walked over to the hills and watched it. Got stuck next to a really boring bastard, didn\u0027t we, Tom?\u0027\n I grunted and nodded. I looked across at Clare who was staring lazily into space. At the mention of the alien ship, however, the others immediately became more interested.\n \u0027We saw it leave,\u0027 James said enthusiastically. \u0027We watched it from home. Bloody amazing, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve never seen anything like it,\u0027 Stephanie added as she passed her sleeping baby to Clare to hold. \u0027It seemed to fly right over the house.\u0027\n \u0027Tom didn\u0027t think it was very impressive,\u0027 Rob whined.\n \u0027That\u0027s not what I said,\u0027 I protested. \u0027I just said that...\u0027 \u0027You wanted more flashing lights and lasers and special effects.\u0027\n \u0027No I didn\u0027t. I just thought that when you consider the size and power of that ship you would have expected a little more. We were sat on the side of that hill for bloody hours and it was over in seconds.\u0027\n \u0027Doesn\u0027t really matter now, does it?\u0027 Clare whispered quietly from her seat in the corner of the room. I turned to look at her and watched as she gently rocked the baby in her arms, her body haunched forward protectively over the tiny child. \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter how big their space ship was or how loud or quiet it was, the only important thing to remember is that they\u0027re here now, and they\u0027re not going anywhere.\u0027\n The hushed tone of her voice conveyed a deadly seriousness and concern.\n \u0027Does that worry you?\u0027 Stephanie asked, surprised.\n Clare nodded.\n \u0027Yes it does,\u0027 she replied simply. Her opinion seemed to have changed since we\u0027d spoken last week. Back then she\u0027d seemed unconcerned and uninterested by the arrival of the aliens. Today, however, the tone of her voice made it sound as if she wanted them forced off the face of our planet altogether.\n \u0027But why?\u0027 Siobhan asked. She had been quiet for a while but was suddenly more animated and involved. \u0027Why does it bother you?\u0027\n Clare shrugged her shoulders, taking care not to disturb the sleeping baby cradled in her arms.\n \u0027Don\u0027t know really,\u0027 she admitted. \u0027It\u0027s probably nothing. I\u0027m probably just wary because I don\u0027t know anything about them yet. When I get to learn a little more then things might change.\u0027\n \u0027It might not be long before you get a chance to do that,\u0027 Rob said suddenly.\n \u0027Why?\u0027 I asked.\n \u0027Haven\u0027t you heard?\u0027 said James.\n \u0027Heard what?\u0027\n \u0027They\u0027re letting them out.\u0027\n \u0027Letting them out?\u0027 gasped Clare. \u0027They can\u0027t do that, surely?\u0027\n \u0027Why not?\u0027 questioned Rob. \u0027Once they\u0027ve been quarantined for a while and we\u0027re sure they don\u0027t pose a risk to our health, why should they be locked away? There won\u0027t be any reason to keep them separated, will there?\u0027\n \u0027No, but...\u0027 Clare stammered.\n \u0027Will they want to mix with us?\u0027 I wondered.\n \u0027Of course they will,\u0027 Stephanie said. \u0027Why shouldn\u0027t they?\u0027\n \u0027Well there are bound to be differences between us, aren\u0027t there? They\u0027re going to have completely different needs. They\u0027ll probably eat different food and they\u0027re going to have their own religions and etiquette, aren\u0027t they? Bloody hell, you shake someone\u0027s hand here and you\u0027re letting them know that you\u0027re pleased to meet them and you don\u0027t pose a threat. Shaking an alien\u0027s hand might mean something completely different to them. It might be their way of telling each other to fuck off!\u0027\n Siobhan laughed.\n \u0027He\u0027s got a point,\u0027 Clare said, quickly jumping to my defence.\n \u0027But come on,\u0027 James sighed, \u0027they\u0027re only going to be here for a few months, aren\u0027t they? And they don\u0027t want to be here, do they? Surely we can make an effort to accommodate them and their needs until they can get home again.\u0027\n \u0027Do we really want to make an effort?\u0027 Clare asked.\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 Stephanie snapped. \u0027Well I do, anyway.\u0027 She seemed surprised and almost annoyed by Clare\u0027s apparent refusal to be flexible and by her uncompromising attitude towards the aliens. \u0027Christ, these people have travelled millions and millions of miles from their homes and now they can\u0027t get back. It\u0027s not their fault they\u0027re stuck here, is it?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 Clare agreed, \u0027but it\u0027s not my fault either. I\u0027m sorry, Steph. I just don\u0027t seem to be able to get into the spirit of interplanetary co-operation as easily as you have. Not just yet, anyway.\u0027\n There followed a long and unexpectedly awkward silence in the conversation.\n \u0027This reminds me of something I was working on at university last term,\u0027 Rob said suddenly.\n For some inexplicable reason best known to himself, my younger brother had decided to study towards a degree in twentieth century English history. Personally I couldn\u0027t see the point. I had always considered any historical study to be a complete waste of time. Where was the sense in continually looking backwards? My philosophy was simple - if you spend all your time looking backwards, you\u0027re going to walk into something eventually.\n \u0027So what were you studying?\u0027 James asked, sounding only half-interested.\n \u0027We were looking at the increase in immigrants who set up home here after the end of the Second World War.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s that got to do with the aliens?\u0027 Siobhan asked.\n \u0027Just think about it,\u0027 Rob continued, adopting a pretentious tone of educated seriousness. \u0027When those people first arrived here back then the indigenous population were paranoid. The newcomers were different, and because they were different people were afraid of them.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not frightened of anyone,\u0027 Clare snapped.\n \u0027I didn\u0027t say you were. That\u0027s not the point I\u0027m making at all...\u0027\n \u0027So what are you saying?\u0027\n He took a deep breath before trying to explain, obviously choosing his words carefully.\n \u0027In the forties and fifties, many of the people born in this country were convinced that the immigrants were here to take their jobs, families and homes from them.\u0027\n \u0027What\u0027s your point?\u0027 I wondered.\n Rob cleared his throat and ran his fingers through his hair. He looked around the room, paying particular attention to Clare and I.\n \u0027Those people were frightened because of their ignorance and their short-sightedness. I\u0027m just trying to make you see that you\u0027ve got a fear of the unknown and as soon as you learn more about these people, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll be more than willing to share the planet with them.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re a patronising bastard,\u0027 I sighed. \u0027You make it sound as if we don\u0027t want anything to do with the aliens.\u0027\n \u0027Do you?\u0027\n I shrugged my shoulders.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know yet.\u0027\n \u0027Clare?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m just not interested,\u0027 she said, very definitely.\n \u0027You should both just give it time.\u0027\n \u0027But it\u0027s not just about time, is it?\u0027\n \u0027Come on,\u0027 James interrupted. \u0027I can\u0027t believe that we\u0027re even having to talk like this. Regardless of what you might think about the aliens, you\u0027ve got to admit that there is a hell of a lot we stand to gain from having them here with us. You\u0027ve got to be able to see it?\u0027\n \u0027Whatever,\u0027 I mumbled.\n The children returned to the room, bringing a welcome distraction from the increasingly heavy conversation. Their noisy, muddy arrival came as something of a relief.\n I really hadn\u0027t intended to sound anti-alien. I knew that their arrival here was of monumental importance to every single person on the surface of the planet.\n But there was still something that bothered me. Something that didn\u0027t quite ring true.\n All caution was being thrown to the wind. In an age when the person who reads your gas meter needs full identification, we were being asked to embrace these visitors from the other side of the universe with open arms.\n I wanted to accept them, I really did. But I needed to be able to trust them first. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-11.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: \n The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
