{"id":112192,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"I was back in Dreighton by half-past eleven on Friday morning. I woke up and found myself alone again. Siobhan was working early and Robert had decided to spend yet another day away with his friends from university. With nothing better to do I ended up back at Porter Farm. Joe Porter was as pleased to see me as he normally was (I was, after all, free labour for him). He reeled off enough jobs to fill four days, never mind the four or five hours that I had originally intended to stay. Just after ten I was standing knee deep in manure, cleaning out a barn that had been used as a temporary shelter for Joe\u0027s cattle while repairs had been made to another building. Joe interrupted my work to ask me if I would take him into Dreighton to pick up a piece of machinery that he\u0027d ordered last week. There wasn\u0027t much of a choice really - stay and shovel shit or get out into the sunshine for a while. Within ten minutes I was washed, changed and ready. Most of the conversation between Joe and I on the way to Dreighton was as sparse and monosyllabic as ever. I didn\u0027t mind - that was Joe\u0027s way. He only ever got excited about a couple of things (usually rugby and cattle) and as I had little interest in either subject I hadn\u0027t expected to talk much. Nevertheless, my instinctive reaction to the silence in the car was to keep trying to say something anyway... \u0027Rob and I were in Dreighton on Wednesday night,\u0027 I said. \u0027Oh,\u0027 grunted Joe. \u0027He was on at me all day to go and see one of the aliens. Wouldn\u0027t shut up about it until I agreed.\u0027 \u0027Oh,\u0027 he grunted again. \u0027We got to see one though. Saw two actually. You know the pub opposite the garage on the high street?\u0027 Joe looked blank. \u0027Next to Mathesons?\u0027 Still blank. \u0027Two doors down from the bank?\u0027 Still blank. \u0027By the Doctors?\u0027 He nodded and grunted. \u0027We were sitting outside having a drink when this bloody big crowd starts coming towards us. The whole town was packed out anyway but this crowd was huge. We knew straight away that it had to be aliens. I climbed up on a table and Rob shinned his way up a lamppost.\u0027 I glanced to my left to check that Joe was still there. \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 he mumbled, prompted to say something by my silence. \u0027Anyway, right in the middle of this crowd were two aliens. I couldn\u0027t believe it. They were just walking along the street like you or I would, except we wouldn\u0027t be surrounded by hundreds of people, would we?\u0027 \u0027Suppose not.\u0027 \u0027Then some bloke started giving them grief, didn\u0027t he? He just stood there in the middle of the pavement and started asking them why they were here and what they wanted and telling them that he didn\u0027t trust them and...\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s no need for that, is there?\u0027 Joe interrupted unexpectedly. \u0027It\u0027s not their fault they\u0027re here, is it? Bloody hell, how would you feel if you was stuck somewhere a million miles from home?\u0027 \u0027I know, but...\u0027 \u0027No, that\u0027s not on. They ain\u0027t done anything wrong.\u0027 \u0027Didn\u0027t think you\u0027d be that bothered, Joe,\u0027 I said, surprised by the strength of his reaction. \u0027Course I\u0027m bothered,\u0027 he said. \u0027Came here to see them myself.\u0027 \u0027Did you?\u0027 He nodded. \u0027I was here Wednesday morning. Had to see the doctor about me back so I thought I\u0027d come early and try and see one of them.\u0027 \u0027And did you see one?\u0027 \u0027Saw a few. Wanted to be one of the first.\u0027 The fact that Joe was interested amazed me and for a couple of seconds I couldn\u0027t think of very much to say. \u0027How is your back?\u0027 I eventually asked. \u0027What did the doctor say?\u0027 He shrugged his shoulders. \u0027Didn\u0027t go in the end. I see Dr Ellis every month, didn\u0027t think it would hurt if I missed one appointment. And anyway, he was out there with me. I saw him and the nurse in the crowds.\u0027 I drove along the high street (which was still busier than usual), turned left onto the road that goes to Yarnell and then pulled up in the car park (which was still fuller than usual) outside the warehouse that Joe wanted. \u0027Back in a minute,\u0027 he grunted as he got out of the car. I watched him disappear into the warehouse and sat and waited. And waited. It was a glorious late summer\u0027s day and even with the windows and sunroof open, the heat inside the car was rapidly becoming unbearable. I got out and sat down on a narrow grass verge which sloped down between the edge of the pavement and the tarmac of the car park. The temperature was adding to my mounting frustration. I wouldn\u0027t have minded if Joe had said he\u0027d be back in three hours - what bothered me was sitting there wasting my time not knowing whether he was going to be out in the next five minutes or whether he\u0027d be talking to his mates in the warehouse for another hour. I could have got up and gone inside to see what was going on but, if I was completely honest, I just couldn\u0027t be bothered to move. I didn\u0027t have anything else to do and, anyway, it was too hot... \u0027Excuse me,\u0027 an unexpected voice suddenly said from somewhere behind me. There was something about the tone and the accent of the voice that was unusual. I knew before I\u0027d turned around that it was an alien. I stood up and tried to reply but I felt inexplicably nervous and my mouth was dry. The alien (which was a good six inches taller than my five foot eleven height) attempted something resembling a smile and shuffled awkwardly on its feet. I knew I was staring but there was nothing I could do to stop myself. \u0027I\u0027m sorry if I disturbed you,\u0027 the visitor said gently. \u0027I\u0027m lost.\u0027 What kind of a species can travel halfway across the universe and then get lost in Dreighton I found myself wondering silently? I didn\u0027t dare say anything even remotely facetious. \u0027Where are you trying to get to?\u0027 I asked instead. \u0027I\u0027m looking for Lime Street ,\u0027 the alien replied politely. \u0027I\u0027m supposed to be meeting a friend there.\u0027 Again I found myself staring at the creature in front of me. It had obviously seen many more humans than I had aliens and I sensed that I was of little reciprocal interest. Its baby-blue eyes quickly scanned my face and the thin lips of its small, delicate mouth gently curled at the corners again. I\u0027d heard that the aliens had two separate sexes in much the same way we do and I guessed that this one was female. There was something about its movements and mannerisms that was innately feminine. \u0027You\u0027re a long way off,\u0027 I said, eventually remembering to reply. \u0027Lime Street \u0027s on the other side of town.\u0027 \u0027Oh,\u0027 she said quietly. \u0027When I say you\u0027re a long way off,\u0027 I continued, blabbering like an idiot, \u0027I\u0027m talking relatively. It\u0027s only half a mile away.\u0027 I was talking before thinking. A bad mistake that was making me look like an idiot. What kind of ambassador was I for my species? \u0027I don\u0027t understand,\u0027 the alien said. \u0027I don\u0027t know what you mean.\u0027 There I was, talking to a visitor from the other side of the galaxy who had been speaking English for just a few weeks and who was speaking it like an expert. I, on the other hand, had been using the language for more than twenty years and yet I was still having trouble making myself understood. \u0027What I meant to say,\u0027 I explained sheepishly, \u0027was that the distance to Lime Street is nothing compared to the distance you\u0027ve travelled to end up here.\u0027 She nodded. No smile this time. \u0027I see.\u0027 There followed a long, awkward and humourless silence. \u0027So can you tell me how to get there?\u0027 the alien asked hopefully. \u0027What? Oh, yes,\u0027 I stammered, feeling my face redden. \u0027Sorry, it\u0027s just that I wasn\u0027t expecting to...\u0027 \u0027To what?\u0027 I didn\u0027t know what to say. Instead I began to direct the alien across town. \u0027Take a right, follow the high street until you reach the junction with the road to Fordham. Turn left and Lime Street is the second road on your right.\u0027 \u0027Thank you,\u0027 she said and she turned and began to walk away. \u0027So how are you finding it here?\u0027 I asked, shouting after her. I instinctively wanted her to stay a little longer. I would have been disappointed if my first conversation with an alien had ended as completely unrewarding and embarrassing as it had begun. She turned back and smiled again. \u0027When you say here,\u0027 she began, \u0027are you talking about the town or the planet?\u0027 \u0027Either,\u0027 I replied. \u0027Both.\u0027 She sighed and thought for a moment before answering. \u0027I don\u0027t know how to answer honestly without offending you...\u0027 she said. \u0027Just offend me then,\u0027 I interrupted. \u0027Your planet is fine, but it\u0027s not what I\u0027m used to. It\u0027s not my home, is it?\u0027 Although her use of the word \u0027fine\u0027 annoyed me because it made my planet sound nondescript and barely adequate, I understood what she was trying to say. \u0027Of course it isn\u0027t,\u0027 I agreed. \u0027Don\u0027t get me wrong, I like what I\u0027ve seen here,\u0027 she continued, \u0027but I\u0027d rather be back home.\u0027 \u0027How long will it be before you get back?\u0027 \u0027A year and a half, maybe longer.\u0027 \u0027And how does that make you feel?\u0027 \u0027Desperate,\u0027 she replied, before turning and walking away again. I watched the alien disappear and thought about her constantly until Joe finally emerged from the warehouse.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-13.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
