{"id":112209,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"After almost an entire day away from home I finally dragged myself wearily back up the steep and twisting pathway which led to my front door. What had started out less than twenty-four hours earlier as a simple trip into the village for food had eventually become a silent nightmare played out in the dead streets of Thatcham. Alone and afraid I felt lost in the sudden hugeness of my tiny home village. The shuttle craft hovered about ten meters away from the door. Perfectly still and silent it was just sat there without reason or explanation. Cold and tired and not daring to take my eyes off the alien ship, I fumbled in my jacket pocket for the keys to the house. My hands were numb and cold and I struggled to try and open the door. But it was already unlocked and for a fraction of a second I felt some hope. The only other people who had keys were Rob and Siobhan. Finding the door unlocked meant that one of them at least had to be inside. \u0027Rob?\u0027 I shouted as I pushed my way in. I kicked the door shut behind me and looked hopefully down the hallway. \u0027Rob? Siobhan? Are you here?\u0027 My words echoed off the cold walls of the house just as my footsteps had echoed in the streets outside. I didn\u0027t believe for a second that either my brother or my girlfriend really were there but I instinctively knew that I wasn\u0027t alone. Before I had seen or heard him I sensed that Rob\u0027s alien friend was about. \u0027Your brother\u0027s in here,\u0027 he said in his dull and dishearteningly familiar voice. He was in the living room. He stepped out of the shadows and stood in the doorway. \u0027What the fucking hell are you doing here?\u0027 I spat as I barged past the alien and shoved him to one side. I found Rob sitting motionless on the sofa, staring at the ground between his feet. For a split second the room was filled with an immense black shadow and I turned and watched through the wide window with frightened fascination as one of the immense black alien machines powered silently through the turbulent sky towards the centre of the helpless village. \u0027Rob,\u0027 I said, quickly turning back to face my brother, \u0027can you hear me? Are you okay?\u0027 What had once been my brother was now just a shell. Cold and emotionless, he was as empty and lifeless as my house and the entire village. I crouched down so that I was directly in front of his dull, vacant eyes but there was still no response. I gently shoved his shoulder and, although he rocked to one side, he still didn\u0027t respond. His corpse-grey skin was clammy and cold but he was still breathing. \u0027He can\u0027t hear you,\u0027 the alien said softly. I ignored him and continued to try and elicit some response from what remained of Rob. \u0027Come on, son,\u0027 I whispered. \u0027Just give me a sign. Let me know you\u0027re still there, will you?\u0027 Nothing. I wiped tears of pain and frustration from my eyes. \u0027I know how you must be feeling...\u0027 the alien began. \u0027Fuck off!\u0027 I spat. \u0027Why don\u0027t you just fuck off? How the hell do you know how I feel?\u0027 Still crouching, I rocked back and sat on the carpet in the middle of the living room. To my right was the television and for a second I turned and glanced into the cold grey screen. I could see Rob\u0027s reflection. He looked just as he had done when we\u0027d sat there together and watched the news broadcasts when the first alien ship had arrived. What had the bastards done to him? What had they done to the world? \u0027It wasn\u0027t supposed to happen like this for you,\u0027 the alien continued, apparently ignorant to the strength of my anger and hate. He took a few steps closer and stopped when he was just a short distance in front of me. I quickly stood up so that we were on the same level. \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 I asked, wiping my stinging eyes dry. \u0027It would have been so much easier for you if you\u0027d been able to accept everything like the rest of them.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re not making any sense,\u0027 I sighed. Nothing was making sense any more. While the rest of the world lay dead outside, it didn\u0027t make any sense to find myself talking to an alien in my home. \u0027Anyway, what the hell are you doing here?\u0027 \u0027Recording,\u0027 he said. \u0027Recording what?\u0027 \u0027Preserving your lifestyle for the archives.\u0027 \u0027What archives?\u0027 \u0027Our archives. I\u0027m a historian and zoologist. We keep records of everything.\u0027 I couldn\u0027t take any more of this in. I fell back into the seat next to Rob. His heavy body slumped against mine and I struggled to hold back more tears. \u0027The very least I owe you is an explanation,\u0027 the alien continued. \u0027You owe me a hell of a lot more than that but go on,\u0027 I grunted, unable to even bring myself to look up at the creature. \u0027Remember the night when I first came here to your house?\u0027 I thought back to the hazy summer just gone and recalled our first meeting when Rob had brought the alien home with him. I remembered feeling uncomfortable like an outsider that night. Rob and Siobhan had treated the damn thing like a bloody superstar. \u0027I remember.\u0027 \u0027We talked a lot about what we were doing here and how we got here. We talked about what I did and where I came from...\u0027 \u0027And...\u0027 \u0027And most of it was lies.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not surprised.\u0027 \u0027I was.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027I was surprised at first. But then again, I always am when it happens. You never get used to it.\u0027 \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 I was rapidly getting sick of his bloody stupid games and riddles. \u0027I told you that my ship was on a mining mission, didn\u0027t I?\u0027 I nodded. \u0027I was wrong, but that was what I truly believed at the time. That was what all of us who came here believed.\u0027 It still wasn\u0027t making any sense. \u0027So what were you here for?\u0027 \u0027Our ship was a probe. It wasn\u0027t destroyed, it was sent back to the fleet. We came here to investigate this planet and see whether it was suitable.\u0027 \u0027Suitable? Suitable for what?\u0027 \u0027For us.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027I told you that the supplies on my home planet had been exhausted. In order to survive my people need more. We need more space and more resources and...\u0027 \u0027So you think you\u0027re just going to take it like that?\u0027 \u0027Wake up, Tom, we already have.\u0027 An icy cold chill of realisation washed over me. The entire human race had been duped by these fucking monsters. I wanted to kill the alien in front of me but I didn\u0027t dare move. I wanted to hear the rest of his explanation first. \u0027But how? How did you do it?\u0027 \u0027Remember we talked about our technology? Remember that night when we argued about how you thought my society was wrong because of the way we work together for the common good? You said it was wrong and I disagreed...\u0027 \u0027I remember.\u0027 \u0027You said it was wrong for us to be able to manipulate thoughts and emotions.\u0027 \u0027It is.\u0027 \u0027I accept that you have your opinion. The beauty of working with minds is that you don\u0027t know it\u0027s happening until it\u0027s done. We\u0027ve been looking at your planet for several years now. This isn\u0027t something that just happened overnight. Once we\u0027d decided that it was suitable we began broadcasting..\u0027 \u0027Broadcasting what?\u0027 \u0027Simple and constant signals. We interrupted your transmissions and added a code of our own. We\u0027ve been reprogramming the entire population of the planet for the last seventeen months through television, radio, the Internet, film and any other medium we could use.\u0027 \u0027Subliminal messages?\u0027 \u0027More complicated than that, but you\u0027re on the right lines. Think about it, Tom, how else could we have just arrived here and dropped ourselves in the middle of your civilisation? You didn\u0027t trust each other, never mind anyone else. You had to let us do it. You had to believe us. And we had to believe what we were telling you.\u0027 \u0027So why all the bullshit about the mining mission and the accident?\u0027 \u0027We needed to be completely sure the planet was right before occupation. We were sent here first to confirm suitability.\u0027 \u0027So you\u0027ve been lying too, or were you being lied to as well?\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re starting to understand. My colleagues and I on the ship fully believed the story we told you. It was important to the mission to ensure that our purpose wasn\u0027t revealed so we didn\u0027t know what it was. Simple as that. We truly believed that we were stranded here.\u0027 \u0027Fucking hell...\u0027 I mumbled. \u0027But how...? How could you have...?\u0027 I couldn\u0027t think straight. This was too much to absorb. \u0027Yours was a fairly advanced society,\u0027 he continued. \u0027And the more advanced a society is, the more it tends to rely on different methods of communication. We just interrupted and modified what you were receiving.\u0027 \u0027But for what purpose? We were prepared to help...\u0027 He shook his bulbous head slowly. \u0027It\u0027s not that simple. Our race continues to grow and we need to expand. We don\u0027t need your help, we need the planet.\u0027 Now I was beginning to feel as though I was trapped in some third-rate science-fiction film. \u0027What are you planning to do...?\u0027 I asked cautiously. \u0027With a few adjustments we\u0027ll create an atmosphere similar to our home world and colonise. Your planet will become the fifth home world.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ve done this before?\u0027 He nodded his bulbous head and stared at me with his baby-blue eyes. \u0027This is the second time I\u0027ve been directly involved.\u0027 \u0027But you can\u0027t. Christ there are billions of people here...\u0027 \u0027Why can\u0027t we? That\u0027s a little hypocritical of you, isn\u0027t it? I don\u0027t expect you to agree with me, but I don\u0027t think that what we\u0027re doing is any different to what you\u0027ve been doing for years.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s completely different,\u0027 I spat, walking over to the window and looking down on the dead village below. \u0027Of course it\u0027s different.\u0027 \u0027Why is it? Is there any difference between us taking your land and you taking the land of someone or something else? You\u0027ve been doing it for millions of years, and now we\u0027re doing it to you.\u0027 \u0027But we\u0027re not just some other animal...\u0027 \u0027You are.\u0027 \u0027But we would never treat another people like this...\u0027 \u0027You would,\u0027 he said simply and without malice or spite. \u0027In fact, the way that we are doing this is fairer and more humane than anything from your history.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s humane about what you\u0027re doing?\u0027 \u0027Most of you don\u0027t even know it\u0027s happening.\u0027 I stared out at the silent world as the alien\u0027s words ran round and round my head. Could it really be true? Had I lost everything? I remembered looking out from the same position countless times during the summer just ended. Now all of that seemed a million miles away, and those rapidly distant memories felt painfully perfect and idyllic. Back then I\u0027d had a life to lead, a brother to argue with and a girlfriend to hold and be held by. Now, if what he was saying was true, I had nothing. So why was I the only one? \u0027Why am I different?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Why am I here talking to you while the rest of the population is...\u0027 I looked down at what remained of my brother but I couldn\u0027t finish my sentence. \u0027It\u0027s difficult to achieve one hundred percent success. Not everyone is able to accept the program.\u0027 \u0027How many are left?\u0027 I wondered, thinking instinctively (for a fraction of a second) about rebellion and honour. \u0027About half a million of you in this country. Look, I\u0027m sorry that it didn\u0027t work for you. It would have been much easier if you hadn\u0027t had to go through this.\u0027 I didn\u0027t want to hear his answer, but I had to ask my next question. \u0027So what happens to everyone else? What about the rest of the population? What about the billions of innocent people who are sitting vacant in their homes like Rob? What are you going to do with them?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027re not going to do anything with them,\u0027 he answered. \u0027We don\u0027t need them.\u0027 \u0027So are you going to ship them off somewhere?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Sterilise them? Stop us reproducing?\u0027 \u0027No. There\u0027s going to be a cull.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027I said there\u0027s going to be a cull. I thought you might have worked it out by now.\u0027 For a few long seconds I didn\u0027t know how to react. I just stood there uselessly, shifting my weight uncomfortably from one foot to the other and staring at the creature in front of me. \u0027But how...?\u0027 I stammered. \u0027How are you going to...?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s not important.\u0027 \u0027When?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s already started. It will run land mass by land mass. There are probably one or two continents which have been completed by now. Things should start to happen here in the next few hours.\u0027 The alien took a single step forward and, instinctively, I took one back. \u0027I\u0027m sorry that it had to happen for you like this,\u0027 he said. I didn\u0027t know if his sorrow was genuine or manufactured. More to the point, I didn\u0027t care. \u0027So what you going to do about me?\u0027 I spat. \u0027If I\u0027m not going to conform to your fucking program, what are you going to do about me?\u0027 He answered quickly. \u0027Nothing.\u0027 \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027Nothing,\u0027 he repeated. \u0027There\u0027s no point, is there? What are you going to do? This isn\u0027t one of your science-fiction books or films, you know. There\u0027s nothing you can do to stop the inevitable. We\u0027re not going to catch a virus and die. You\u0027re not going to find a computer glitch and destroy our ships. There\u0027s absolutely nothing you can do except sit here and wait...\u0027 What he said made it all the more harder for me to accept what was going to happen. There would have been more dignity in dying in battle, but it looked as though I wouldn\u0027t even be able to pick a fight. I felt like a lone tree left standing in the remains of a forest where thousands of others had been torn up by their roots to make way for a new city . And what could I do to stop this happening? Nothing. Absolutely fucking nothing. \u0027Sit back and watch,\u0027 he continued. \u0027You might be able to survive for a few weeks. Keep out of the way of the cull and find yourself somewhere remote and watch it happen. I\u0027ve seen it happen elsewhere. It\u0027s exhilarating.\u0027 \u0027What is?\u0027 \u0027The change.\u0027 That was enough for me. I had to get out. I was wasting precious time and I knew that I had to get back to Clare and Penny. But I couldn\u0027t leave Rob. I reached out and grabbed his lifeless hand. \u0027Don\u0027t waste your time with Robert, there\u0027s no point,\u0027 the alien said from a position just inches behind me. \u0027He can\u0027t hear you. He can\u0027t see you. And even if he could, he wouldn\u0027t know who you were or how to talk to you.\u0027 I squeezed Rob\u0027s hand hard, hoping that I could force a reaction from him. There was nothing. \u0027Come on,\u0027 I pleaded. \u0027If I can fuck their programming up then so can you. Come on!\u0027 I slapped his face. Nothing. \u0027This isn\u0027t doing either of you any good, Tom. I suggest that you get...\u0027 \u0027Fuck off!\u0027 I spat, turning round and glaring at the alien who continued to talk unabated. \u0027Do you want me to tell you exactly what\u0027s happened to him? Shall I tell you which parts of his brain have been disabled and which parts we\u0027ve left operational? Will it help if I...?\u0027 The creature\u0027s words trailed away into silence as I stood and stared up into his cold and emotionless face. His bright blue eyes stared back at me. He was on my property, how dare he tell me what to do? His kind had destroyed my brother, my girlfriend and just about everyone and everything else that meant anything to me. Memories of all that I\u0027d lost clouded my mind. The loss of everything I had owned and everything I had been hurt like a thousand knives stabbing into my skin. And just for a second it was all this alien\u0027s fault. Just for a moment all of my hate, fear, frustration, pain, rage and terror was directed towards this one, despicable alien bastard. In a single movement I launched myself at him and knocked him flying across the room. Overbalanced by his bulbous head and struggling to pick himself up with his long, flailing limbs, he lay at my feet, cowering. \u0027Don\u0027t do this,\u0027 he pleaded as he slowly dragged himself back up. \u0027Don\u0027t waste your time.\u0027 \u0027You take my life and now you want pity?\u0027 I hissed, stunned by the creature\u0027s gall. \u0027I don\u0027t want anything from you. You haven\u0027t got long. Just get away from here and...\u0027 I ran at him again, grabbed him by the neck and pushed him out into the hall. Still holding tight, I swung him round and slammed him up against the wall. I clenched my fist and hit him square on the jaw. He crumpled to the ground at my feet again and began to crawl towards the front door. \u0027Fucking bastard,\u0027 I yelled as I ran after him. He turned and looked back at me and I could see that there were tears running down his face. Thick, dark blood was pouring down his chin from a spit in his lower lip. The bloody thing was crying and begging for mercy. \u0027Please,\u0027 he sobbed. \u0027This isn\u0027t my fault. I didn\u0027t plan any of this.\u0027 For a fraction of a second I felt some pity, but all it took was for me to picture the friends and family that I\u0027d lost to bring me back to feeling nothing but hate and despair. \u0027What good is your perfect fucking society now?\u0027 I sneered as I picked him up by the collar and held him against the wall again. I looked into his pathetic, whimpering face and then closed my eyes and concentrated my thoughts on all that had been taken from me. \u0027Where are the others to protect you?\u0027 \u0027Please...\u0027 he croaked. \u0027I\u0027ve got work to finish...\u0027 I was never going to hold Siobhan again or hear her tell me that she loved me. I was never again going to walk along the beach with her at dusk and make love all night. I would never go drinking with Rob again or run through the village or watch a film on TV or listen to music... One last look into the alien\u0027s eyes. \u0027You\u0027ve taken everything I had,\u0027 I hissed. I lifted my right hand and covered the creature\u0027s face with it. I squeezed tightly and could feel his chin, cheeks and forehead beneath my fingers. I squeezed hard, hoping that it was hurting. I pulled his head forward and paused for a second. One last whimper. Letting go of all my hate and anger, I slammed the fucker\u0027s head back into the wall. He slumped. I pulled his head forward then smashed it back again. Forward then back again. Forward then back again and again and again until I felt the fucker\u0027s skull crunching and splitting. I let the body go and it fell to the ground. Back in the living room, Rob had rolled off the sofa and now lay face down on the carpet. I thought for a second that he had made a conscious movement but it was obvious that he had not. I owed it to him to make one last-ditch attempt to revive him and to try and snap him free from this dire lethargy. I picked him back up and sat down on the carpet in front of him. I looked up into his expressionless face. \u0027Rob...\u0027 I whispered. \u0027Rob, it\u0027s me, Tom.\u0027 Still no response. With every second that passed so the pain I felt increased. \u0027Can you hear me? If you\u0027d just say or do something then at least I\u0027d know you were there and...\u0027 It was pointless. \u0027I just wanted you to know that...\u0027 I couldn\u0027t even bring myself to finish my sentence. There was nothing I could do. My brother was gone. Wiping tears of sadness, confusion and fear from my eyes, I walked towards the door. I stopped and turned back to take one last look at what remained of Robert Winter. I knew that Siobhan would be in exactly the same desperate condition, and that made the pain even worse. I knew that I had to get back to Clare, and until I was with her I would be completely alone. My family and my life had been taken away from me. Rob and Siobhan had been the last ones to have mattered.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-30.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
