{"id":112200,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"I woke up early next morning. It was still pitch-black and silent outside. After a few sleepy and blissfully ignorant moments had passed I quickly remembered all that had happened yesterday. I was immediately consumed by a heavy melancholy and bitter, desperate sadness again. The night just ending had been long, dark and lonely. I could still smell Siobhan\u0027s perfume on the bedclothes and that added to my wanting. Maybe I would try and phone her later. Perhaps I\u0027d even pluck up the courage to go round and see her. But then again perhaps I wouldn\u0027t bother. It hurt not being with her but I knew it would hurt much, much more if she rejected me again. For a while I lay in my bed and stared out at the sleeping world through a narrow gap in the curtains. The sky was dark - a deep, ruddy purple - but the darkness was very gradually being eaten away by the first distant glow of the orange light of dawn. The tops of the trees I could see were perfectly still. The only movement was that of an occasional bird darting across the morning sky in silhouette. I dragged myself out of bed a little after half-past five. There didn\u0027t seem to be any point in lying there and festering when there was virtually no chance of being able to get back to sleep again. Dark, depressing thoughts were already beginning to run around my mind at a thousand miles a second and I stumbled into the living room in search of distractions. I collapsed on the sofa and reached for the remote control. I hadn\u0027t been up at this hour of the day for a long, long time. I sat down and watched few seconds of a ridiculously bright breakfast television programme on the TV. The pictures on the screen provided a stark contrast to the cold, grey shadows in the gloom all around me. I didn\u0027t want to be without Siobhan. I ended up at the farm. In the car on the way there I had been looking forward to some company and conversation. Within minutes of arriving there, however, I found that I wanted to be alone. I had a quiet word with Joe Porter and he seemed to understand. He found me a job in one of the fields furthest from the farm house. Something that would last for a while and keep my mind and body fully occupied. And the therapy seemed to work. After venting my anger and taking out my frustration on a stretch of weather-beaten fence which Joe wanted replaced, I began to feel slightly better. Even though nothing made any more sense than it had done last night, I had at least managed to put everything into some kind of perspective. I gradually managed to convince myself that I had been right all along and that it was Siobhan who had the problem. I hadn\u0027t done anything wrong. I didn\u0027t have to take the kind of crap that she\u0027d hurled in my direction. I loved her and I was there for her and, as far as I was concerned, that would always be the case. So what had happened in her life to change things? Why had her opinion of me suddenly changed so drastically? The dilapidated fence that I was replacing separated a recently ploughed field from a rough pasture where Joe\u0027s sheep often grazed. As I worked the sheep became used to my presence and slowly got closer. I found that the harder I concentrated on the job, the easier it was for me to switch off from my problems, but I was distracted when the nearby sheep suddenly scattered. There was a tractor approaching. I thought at first that there was an emergency, such was the speed that it came towards me. The huge, heavy wheels churned up the pasture and sent the sheep running in all directions, many into the ploughed field through gaps where the fence was still down. I stared at the driver and saw that it was Joe Porter himself. I immediately knew that something was wrong. He would never normally have driven with such disregard for his land or his livestock. He stopped the tractor alongside me. \u0027What the hell you doing?\u0027 he yelled over the deafening din of the engine. \u0027Fixing the fence,\u0027 was my obvious reply. \u0027Just doing what you asked me to do.\u0027 For a second I wondered whether I was fixing the right fence. Joe looked ready to explode. \u0027I can see that,\u0027 he snapped as he jumped down from his seat. \u0027I ain\u0027t stupid. I know what I asked you to do.\u0027 The engine was still running and I watched as thick clouds of oily exhaust fumes spewed into the air. \u0027So what\u0027s the problem?\u0027 I wondered. \u0027Problem is that you were supposed to be fixing the fence this morning. I can\u0027t wait all bloody day for you to finish a job.\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s taking longer than I thought. I\u0027m on my own here and...\u0027 \u0027I need it finished.\u0027 \u0027I should be done in a couple of...\u0027 \u0027I want it done in the hour. If you\u0027re going to work for me, then you\u0027re going to work how I want you to. If I give you something to do, you bloody well do it quickly.\u0027 This was not the Joe Porter I was used to seeing. His familiar wrinkled smile had disappeared and his face was flushed red with anger. I had never seen him like this. Something must have happened. Surely the fact that I was still working couldn\u0027t have been the only reason for his frustration? Christ, this was the man who hadn\u0027t even raised his voice when he\u0027d lost virtually an entire herd of cattle in a flash-flood earlier this year. \u0027Listen Joe,\u0027 I protested, looking him straight in the eye, \u0027I work here because I want to help. You don\u0027t pay me for what I do and I don\u0027t think you\u0027re in any position to criticise. I\u0027m working as fast as I can. If you don\u0027t want me to help then I\u0027ll just go...\u0027 \u0027Finish the job you started,\u0027 he said, \u0027then go.\u0027 With that he turned his back on me and climbed back into the tractor. I still couldn\u0027t help thinking that this whole conversation didn\u0027t make any sense. Something else must have happened. \u0027Look,\u0027 I said, trying a different tack, \u0027what\u0027s the problem? I\u0027m doing what you asked me to...\u0027 Porter just scowled at me and shook his head before putting his foot down and driving away again, carving yet another set of deep, muddy furrows in his precious green field. I watched him disappear in disbelief. Determined not to give him any more reasons to be angry with me, I decided to finish the job before leaving for home. First Siobhan and now the farmer, what the hell was going on? I began smashing down a wooden fence post with a lump hammer, beating out my frustrations. I didn\u0027t want revenge or retributions. I wanted explanations.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-21.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
