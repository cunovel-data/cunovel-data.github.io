{"id":112214,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"Footsteps. Not ordinary footsteps - footsteps that were synchronised and regimental in their pace. Footsteps that were programmed, planned and controlled. Thousands of involuntary footsteps directed with a cold, emotionless precision. Footsteps that were getting closer by the second. The ominous marching sound could clearly be heard through the churning, blustery air and I knew immediately what was coming towards us. Clare looked confused. She\u0027d heard me talk about the vast columns of people I\u0027d seen but she hadn\u0027t seen much of them yet for herself. It was what couldn\u0027t be heard that unnerved me. Other than the muffled sound of countless pairs of feet dragging themselves over the hard ground there was nothing else. Not even a single whimper or moan of protestation could be heard. Just ahead of us the road curved round tight to the right. \u0027Wait here,\u0027 I whispered and I gestured for Clare to press herself against the hedgerow and camouflage herself as best she could. \u0027Where you going?\u0027 she asked nervously, her face suddenly filled with fear and uncertainty. \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 I shook my head. \u0027It\u0027s nothing,\u0027 I lied. \u0027Look, I just want to check round the corner. I\u0027ll be back in a couple of seconds.\u0027 I was gone before she had chance to protest. I sprinted a short way further up the road. There was nothing there - the road straightened again and seemed to run on for another half mile or so - and I quickly turned back. I ran past Clare, doubling-back on myself, and carried on back down the road until I could see the heads of the first few approaching figures. The hedge was low at that point and I was able to see a fair way into the distance. A seemingly unending line of figures were moving towards us relentlessly, still marching in their unnaturally precise formation. I had seen all that I needed to see and I ran back to Clare. \u0027What?\u0027 she demanded. She was standing in the middle of the road with her hands on her hips. \u0027What\u0027s going on?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s like I saw earlier,\u0027 I replied. \u0027Bloody hundreds of people heading our way.\u0027 \u0027What are they doing out here?\u0027 \u0027No idea. There\u0027s nothing round here for miles.\u0027 She wasn\u0027t listening. I glanced back over my shoulder and saw that the beginning of the vast column of people had come into view. Four figures with their faces fixed dead ahead, followed by four more, then four more and then more after that... I could tell from the expression on Clare\u0027s face that she knew something was wrong. \u0027Just keep out of the way,\u0027 I whispered. \u0027They won\u0027t even notice us. Just get back against the hedge.\u0027 This time she did just as I asked and she shuffled back into the undergrowth. I stood in front of her, trying to block and protect her from the advancing people. They began to pass us. \u0027Can you stop one of them?\u0027 she asked from behind me. \u0027Not worth it. I tried earlier. Pull one out of line and they\u0027ll just merge back into formation as soon as you let go.\u0027 \u0027Is this what you saw in the village this morning?\u0027 \u0027Similar. Same formation.\u0027 \u0027But why?\u0027 She knew I couldn\u0027t answer. \u0027Don\u0027t know.\u0027 \u0027So where are these people from?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t know.\u0027 \u0027Where are they going?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t know,\u0027 I snapped, now not bothered if any of the bodies heard me. \u0027Fucking hell, how am I supposed to know the answer to that?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 she mumbled. \u0027I just needed to ask. I\u0027ve got a thousand and one questions in my head and I just needed to...\u0027 \u0027Forget it,\u0027 I interrupted, turning round to face her. \u0027Just forget all your questions because there\u0027s no point. There\u0027s nothing we can do about any of this.\u0027 \u0027But why are they out here? There must be a reason...?\u0027 \u0027What does it matter?\u0027 I turned back to look at the bodies walking down the middle of the road. By now the first few were following the tight curve of the road perfectly. \u0027But what about Penny?\u0027 she asked. I could hear her sniffing back more tears. \u0027What about Rob and Siobhan and...\u0027 \u0027Gone,\u0027 I replied, trying desperately to hide my emotion and disguise my pain. \u0027My guess is they\u0027re all in one of these queues somewhere. Might even be here for all we know.\u0027 \u0027Do you think so?\u0027 she said, suddenly more alert. I instantly regretted my words. \u0027Forget it,\u0027 I said again as the vast procession continued past us. \u0027There must be something we can do.\u0027 \u0027Like what? What are we going to do to help the millions of poor bastards like these?\u0027 \u0027I just can\u0027t believe that there\u0027s nothing we can do.\u0027 \u0027Get it through your head, Clare,\u0027 I sighed, \u0027it\u0027s too late. The time to act was months ago when those fucking aliens first arrived here.\u0027 Another wave of brilliant light distracted me. An alien ship appeared overhead. It was flying ominously low. \u0027Shit,\u0027 I hissed. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027That thing,\u0027 I said, glancing up at the massive black machine. \u0027We\u0027ve seen a hundred of them. What\u0027s different about this one...\u0027 She was silenced when her question was unexpectedly answered. The ship suddenly stopped dead. It hovered low in the sky just a short distance away. \u0027I think we should get out of here,\u0027 I mumbled nervously. \u0027Which way?\u0027 \u0027Back.\u0027 We turned and ran in the opposite direction, retracing the route of the bodies in reverse. We sprinted for all we were worth until we couldn\u0027t go any further and then stopped. The road had climbed slightly and from our elevated position the alien ship didn\u0027t seem to be any further away. Clare was fighting to catch her breath. She retched with exhaustion, fear and mounting panic. Doubled-up with pain, she dropped to her knees. \u0027You okay?\u0027 I asked, crouching down next to her. \u0027Sorry,\u0027 she wheezed. \u0027Can\u0027t go any further.\u0027 I stood and turned back to look towards the ship. I could see the part of the road we\u0027d just run along and, further in the distance, I could see the tight corner and the stretch of straight road beyond that. I could also see the bodies. Clare dragged herself back onto her feet and stood next to me. \u0027What the bloody hell is happening now?\u0027 I heard her ask although I did not answer. As we watched the crowd of figures left the road and entered a large square field through a single narrow gate. Bizarrely, they then formed themselves into perfectly straight lines across the width of the field. With equal distance between the bodies on all sides, the people stood motionless. Many of them were half dressed, and all of them were soaked to the skin. But still they didn\u0027t move. Each individual remained upright and impassive. In just a couple of minutes the field was full. I quickly counted thirty-two rows of thirty-two people. The alien ship was hovering directly above the centre of the field. A single opening appeared towards the front of the vessel and from it emerged a long, dark stem. This ship was identical to the one I\u0027d seen in the skies over Thatcham hours earlier. \u0027What\u0027s that?\u0027 Clare asked nervously, grabbing hold of my arm. I was about to tell her that I\u0027d seen something similar when it happened. In a fraction of a second the field (and just the field - not any of the surrounding countryside) was filled with a precise square of intense blue-white light. Far brighter than the light from the engines of any of the alien machines, it scorched our skin. We turned away instinctively. Another fraction of a second and it was over. The world was suddenly drenched in a deeper darkness than before. Almost too afraid to look, I cautiously stared into the field again. The alien ship was already on its way, soaring effortlessly above the countryside. The field was empty. Clare and I walked back down the road and cautiously approached the entrance to the field. As we walked I tried to explain to her the little I understood of what had just happened. \u0027It\u0027s a cull,\u0027 I said simply. \u0027What?\u0027 We stood at the edge of the field and stared at the empty space where just over a thousand people had been standing minutes earlier. \u0027I said it\u0027s a cull,\u0027 I repeated. \u0027I found out about it this morning. I didn\u0027t bother telling you...\u0027 \u0027You didn\u0027t think you should tell me that those bloody things up there are planning to get rid of us all? You didn\u0027t think that I might have needed to know what\u0027s going to happen to...\u0027 \u0027I didn\u0027t tell you because there\u0027s fuck all you or me or anyone can do about it. The aliens need the planet but they don\u0027t need us. It\u0027s as simple as that.\u0027 \u0027But they can\u0027t. They just can\u0027t...\u0027 \u0027They already have.\u0027 Too tired to argue I dropped the heavy sports bag and leant against a metal gatepost. \u0027But those people were...\u0027 \u0027Save your breath,\u0027 I sighed. I pointed up into the sky. \u0027Go and tell them how pissed off you are about the whole thing if you want to, but it won\u0027t do you any good. You do well if you manage to find one of those cowardly bastards.\u0027 I picked up the bag and started to walk again. \u0027We\u0027ll be okay if we keep out of their way. We\u0027ll keep our heads down and keep out of their way.\u0027 I took one last look at the field as we carried on down the road. It looked perfectly normal - untouched and unspoilt as if no-one had ever been there. One thing was certain, there were no hidden escape routes and no alternative explanations. Over a thousand people had been destroyed in seconds.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-35.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
