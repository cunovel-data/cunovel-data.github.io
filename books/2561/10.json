{"id":112189,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"In spite of the huge and sudden increase in the population levels of Thatcham, no-one in the village went to The Badger\u0027s Sett that Friday evening. Ray Mercer wasn\u0027t even there. In fact, for the first time in living memory (apart from when the cellar had flooded two winters back) the pub was closed. Exactly one week had passed since the arrival of the alien visitors and preparations were well in hand for the jettison of their useless, crippled transport away from our planet and out towards the sun. Although no exact time scales were available, we were assured that it would happen tonight. Across the world the media reported that, within the next two or three hours, the massive machine\u0027s silent engines would be fired for the final time. A vast crowd had gathered on the sprawling hills and cliff tops overlooking the ocean to watch the monumental event. During the last few days the flow of bodies into Thatcham and the surrounding villages and towns had been relentless and had increased still further once the launch date of the ship had been revealed. Even now with only hours to go and with the entire area heaving with people I could still see apparently endless columns of cars snaking along country roads towards the coast. They were so tightly packed that the headlamps of one car did little more than illuminate the back bumper of the one in front. Many had simply stopped and parked up on grass verges. Everyone wanted to be as close as possible to the alien ship when it finally left our atmosphere. People clamoured for a chance to see an alien or, at the very least, some distant alien activity. Everyone wanted to be there to witness history being made. Although I hadn\u0027t seemed to match the excited fervour of most people, I too didn\u0027t want to miss anything. This was a chance to be a part of something that would be permanently etched into our history books and, in all probability, into the alien\u0027s history books too. Robert and I sat amongst the excited masses on the cliff-top not far from where I\u0027d stood and watched the ship first arrive. We crouched down together on a small patch of dry, brittle grass and waited impatiently for something to happen. \u0027Bloody hell, did you see that one?\u0027 Rob gasped as a jet of brilliant white light suddenly shot across the distant horizon from left to right. \u0027I saw it,\u0027 I replied, finding it increasingly difficult not to sound bored. I had seen the last flash of light, and I had also seen the last twenty or thirty identical flashes before it. The aliens were stripping their ship - removing anything of value and using their small, silver shuttles to transport it back to the shore. \u0027There can\u0027t be much more left for them to do now,\u0027 Rob said, babbling like an excited child. \u0027Christ, they\u0027ve had all week to empty the bloody thing.\u0027 \u0027Think they\u0027ll keep those shuttles here?\u0027 I asked as I lay back on the grass and looked up into the clear, dark sky. My head was suddenly filled with images of the incredible, sleek ships struggling to fit in with the flow of our own clumsy, ground-based traffic. \u0027They can\u0027t,\u0027 a loud and cocksure voice said from the darkness just behind and to the right of me. I sat up and turned around to try and locate the owner of the disembodied voice. \u0027Why not?\u0027 I asked, aiming my question in the general direction from which the last answer had come. \u0027Because the shuttles are powered by the mothership,\u0027 the voice replied. \u0027They would be able to function for a couple of days, but after that they\u0027d be useless.\u0027 \u0027Did you know that?\u0027 I asked Rob. He nodded his head with some surprise. \u0027Course I did. Everybody knows that. Christ, haven\u0027t you been paying attention?\u0027 A middle-aged man wearing a flat cap and a shirt (with the sleeves neatly rolled up to just above the elbow) and brown tie shuffled awkwardly down the gentle slope towards us and squeezed himself in between Robert and myself. He had a pair of thick, heavily framed glasses perched on the bridge of his proud, pronounced nose, and had a dark little moustache nestling above the middle of his top lip. In the low light he looked bizarre - the bastard son of Adolf Hitler and a pigeon-fancier. \u0027The shuttles were only designed to be used for short distances,\u0027 he continued, uninvited. \u0027They\u0027re nowhere near as well shielded as the main ship.\u0027 \u0027They\u0027re stronger than anything we could ever make, of course,\u0027 Rob said, picking up where our visitor had left off, \u0027but compared to the mother ship they\u0027re nowhere near as robust.\u0027 \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 I sighed, \u0027have you done anything this week except sit and watch the TV?\u0027 The other man interrupted again. \u0027I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve missed a single piece of news yet,\u0027 he said with some pride. \u0027I\u0027ve travelled almost two hundred miles to get here today. I was on the train before seven this morning.\u0027 \u0027Were you really?\u0027 I sighed, neither impressed or interested. \u0027I was. What about you two? Have you come far?\u0027 I shook my head nonchalantly. \u0027No. If you stand up and walk to the top of the hill you can see my house.\u0027 \u0027Really?\u0027 he gasped, suddenly appearing to be both rabidly interested and insanely jealous at the same time. \u0027Did you see the ship when it first arrived?\u0027 he asked excitedly. \u0027Where were you when it first appeared?\u0027 \u0027I was just over there,\u0027 I replied, pointing over to my right in the general direction of the twisting path I had been running along when the storm had broken and I\u0027d watched the ship fly out over the ocean. \u0027Could you see much?\u0027 \u0027I saw everything,\u0027 I answered, taking some sadistic pleasure in taunting our new friend. \u0027What was it like?\u0027 he demanded impatiently. \u0027I\u0027ve watched the footage again and again on the television, but to have actually been here when it happened...\u0027 \u0027It was okay,\u0027 I mumbled, deliberately trying to wind him up. \u0027You know, big and black and...\u0027 I was interrupted as a helicopter suddenly reared up from behind us and screeched through the air above our heads, causing a shock wave of noisy, slightly nervous excitement to quickly spread through the tightly-packed crowds like a massive Mexican wave. The unexpected deluge of sound and light was confusing. For a second or two just about everyone gathered on the hillsides thought that something had started to happen. \u0027Damn,\u0027 said the man sitting between Rob and I, \u0027just a helicopter.\u0027 I turned and noticed that he had a pair of battered binoculars hanging around his scrawny neck. \u0027Could I borrow those for a second?\u0027 I asked. He thought carefully before reluctantly taking off the glasses and handing them to me. \u0027Here,\u0027 he mumbled. \u0027Watch what you\u0027re doing with them won\u0027t you. I\u0027ve had them for years...\u0027 Staring out over the ocean and out towards the horizon I was just able to make out the shadowy shape of the alien mothership. Its smooth, black fuselage still hung steady and motionless over the calm sea. As my eyes became accustomed to the low light where the purple-black sky met the sea I could see hundreds of tiny lights which pinpricked the bulkhead of the ship and shone out into the night like the countless stars above me. A steady stream of busy shuttles poured out from deep within the bowels of the ship. Each one of them swooped down towards the surface of the water, unloaded their cargo onto the decks of a fleet of waiting boats, and then quickly disappeared back up into the dark safety of the cavernous ship again. Then, after I had been watching for a minute or two, they suddenly stopped. Conscious that the man next to me was keen to get his binoculars back, I deliberately ignored him and turned my attention below to the gently rolling waves in the shadows of the colossal ship. I could see a long line of boats which were now travelling back towards land. The flotilla virtually stretched from the ship to the shore. \u0027Looks like something might be happening,\u0027 I said under my breath. \u0027What can you see?\u0027 Rob asked. I put the glasses down for a second and they were immediately snatched back by their owner. He quickly lifted them up to his own eyes and stared out to sea. \u0027The ships are moving back towards the shore,\u0027 I answered, \u0027and the shuttles have stopped flying. Looks like they\u0027ve finished packing!\u0027 The sudden change in the behaviour of the aliens was also noticed by some of the many other people in the vast crowd who were also using binoculars or, in one or two extreme cases, telescopes. Once again an unstoppable wave of contagious excitement and interest swept through the massive gathering with the deadly speed of a bush fire tearing through a tinder-dry forest. \u0027They must be taking everything to their new base,\u0027 the man who still perched between my brother and I said under his breath. He watched transfixed as the line of ships snaked away from the shadows of the belly of the alien craft. \u0027Did you know that they\u0027ve constructed a safe area near here for them?\u0027 \u0027I had heard something,\u0027 I replied, suddenly a little more interested in the conversation. \u0027I was wondering where they were going to go. You\u0027d have thought they\u0027d have been carted off and hidden somewhere well away from...\u0027 \u0027Not at all,\u0027 he interrupted. \u0027There\u0027s a disused holiday camp near here...\u0027 \u0027Brymer Sands,\u0027 Rob piped up. The man continued. \u0027That\u0027s right. It\u0027s been refurbished and security has been tightened so that they can stay there.\u0027 \u0027But will they stay there?\u0027 I wondered. \u0027Why should they?\u0027 Rob snapped, sounding strangely defensive. \u0027Bloody hell, it\u0027s not their fault they\u0027re stuck here, is it? Christ, remember when Mum and Dad took us to Brymer Sands when we were little? We were hard pushed to spend a week there. You can\u0027t expect bloody interplanetary travellers to be locked up there for a few months, can you? No, they said on the news this morning that they were going to be free to travel.\u0027 Was there anything that my brother and the irritating, annoying little man who had joined us didn\u0027t know about the aliens? They seemed to know everything about their needs and their plans, far more than I would have expected them to. But then information didn\u0027t seem to be very hard to come by. Every time I turned on the television or logged onto the Internet I saw nothing but alien news and updates. I guess my problem was that I didn\u0027t have the same rabid interest as everyone else seemed to. Their arrival was interesting and had changed the course of human history for sure, but my life was still the same. Nothing much had altered. \u0027Is it a good idea to give them freedom?\u0027 I asked. \u0027Why not?\u0027 questioned Rob. \u0027We all know so much that there\u0027s nothing left to hide. And if the authorities did an about face and closed ranks on us now, what would it achieve? If people don\u0027t get told the truth, they\u0027ll invent their own version, won\u0027t they? If the flow of information was cut-off now it would only be a matter of hours before the papers would be full of stories about little green men and ray guns and crap like that...\u0027 I understood what he was saying but something didn\u0027t ring true. I couldn\u0027t quite put my finger on it, and I couldn\u0027t begin to explain how I felt because I wasn\u0027t really sure myself. Something was definitely eating at me. Everything seemed inexplicably simple and uncomplicated. In a sense it felt as if every question I could think to ask about the aliens had been answered for me before I\u0027d even had chance to speak. At seventeen minutes past eleven the last human ship reached the shore and, for the first time since the aliens had arrived, the skies over the ocean were almost clear. A hushed and expectant silence swept through the enormous (and still growing) crowd that had gathered to witness the final few moments of the mighty machine. People scrambled further up the hillside and balanced themselves precariously on the obliging shoulders of friends, stretching and craning their necks so that they could get a clear view of the release of the ship. Without warning, in a fraction of a second, the sea for miles around the rear of the immense alien machine was suddenly illuminated by a flood of searing, incandescent light which poured out from the powerful engines. The ship remained bewilderingly silent and I watched in wonder as it graciously turned full circle and began to glide back towards the shore. Billions of pairs of eyes stared out from every last corner of the globe to watch as the beautiful black machine gently lifted its nose to the stars and then blasted out into space, soaring straight over my head. Less than two minutes had passed before the incredible machine had disappeared completely from view. A sudden wave of spontaneous cheering and applause echoed through the warm summer air. I stood up (my view had been good enough for me to remain seated throughout) and then reached back down to help pull Rob up onto his feet. \u0027Bloody hell,\u0027 he said with a vacant grin of disbelief plastered across his face. \u0027That was incredible. Did you see the size of that thing?\u0027 I nodded and yawned and began to walk back up the slope of the hill towards home. Hordes of excited, chattering people swarmed around me. \u0027Impressive, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027 I said sarcastically, trying unsuccessfully to hide the unexpected disappointment that I was feeling. The ship had been an amazing sight to behold but, now that it had gone, I was left filled with a sense of anticlimax. Rob was ignorant to my feelings and carried on talking regardless. \u0027How could something so big be so quiet?\u0027 he wondered enthusiastically. \u0027And the light from those engines! Jesus, I\u0027ve never seen anything like it!\u0027 I weaved my way through the sea of vast, meandering figures. Some of them were still fixed to the spot, staring up into space transfixed and hoping to snatch one last glimpse of the awesome alien ship. We reached the top of the hill and I looked down towards Thatcham. Even from a distance I could see that the village streets were heaving with cars and people. \u0027We could have made a bloody fortune tonight,\u0027 I mumbled, stifling a tired yawn. \u0027How?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve never seen so many people,\u0027 I explained. \u0027I could have hired out the spare room or let a couple of them put tents up in the garden...\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s not too late.\u0027 \u0027Suppose.\u0027 \u0027You could still do it, there\u0027s plenty of time. There are still people arriving. I bet there\u0027s going to be hundreds of people sleeping in the back of their cars tonight.\u0027 \u0027More fool them,\u0027 I grumbled. \u0027Don\u0027t worry,\u0027 Rob continued. \u0027It\u0027s going to stay busy round here for a long time yet.\u0027 \u0027You reckon?\u0027 \u0027Course it is. Bloody hell, we\u0027ve got aliens living thirty miles up the coast. Everyone\u0027s going to want to see them.\u0027 He was right. As we stumbled on towards home I glanced back over my shoulder. I could just about make out the twinkling lights of the camp at Brymer. The aliens were close. Damn close. I wasn\u0027t overly concerned or worried that they were near, but I still couldn\u0027t bring myself to match the euphoria which seemed to have consumed just about everyone else.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/trust/page-10.html","bookId":2561,"book":{"id":2561,"title":"Trust","description":"Storyline: The most important event in human history takes place in the middle of nowhere.
