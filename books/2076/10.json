{"id":111739,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Things have to be right,\" Poppy said. \"Things have to be just right for this. Get some candles, Phil.\" Phil was looking ashen and haggard. \"Candles?\" \"As many as you can find. And some pillows. I need lots of pillows.\" She knelt by the stereo to examine a haphazard pile of CDs. Phil stared at herbriefly, then went out. \" Structures from Silence . . .no. Too repetitious,\"Poppy said, rummaging through the pile.\" Deep Forest-no.Too hyper. I need somethingambient.\" \"How about this?\" James picked a CD up. Poppylooked at the label. Music to Disappear In. Of course. It was perfect. Poppy took the CD andmet James\u0027s gaze. Usually he referred to the hauntingsoft strains of ambient music as \u0027New Age mush.\u0027 \"You understand,\" she said quietly. \"Yes. But you\u0027re not dying, Poppy. This isn\u0027t adeath scene you\u0027re setting up.\" \"But I\u0027m going away. I\u0027m changing.\" Poppy couldn\u0027t explain exactly, but something in her saidshe was doing the right thing. She was dying to her old life. It was a solemn occasion, a Passage. And of course, although neither of them mentioned it, they both knew shemightdie for good.James had been very frank about that-some peopledidn\u0027t make it through the transition. Phil came back with candles, Christmas candles,emergency candles, scented votive candles. Poppy directed him to place them around the room and lightthem. She herself went to the bathroom to change into her best nightgown. It was flannel, with a pattern of little strawberries. Just imagine, she thought as she left the bathroom.This is the last time I\u0027ll ever walk down this hall, thelast time I\u0027ll push open my bedroom door. The bedroom was beautiful. The soft glow of candlelight gave it an aura of sanctity, of mystery. Themusic was unearthly and sweet, and Poppy felt shecould fall into it forever, the way she fe!l in herdreams. Poppy opened the closet and used a hanger to bata tawny stuffed lion and a floppy gray Eeyore down from the top shelf. She took them to her bed and put them beside the mounded pillows. Maybe it wasstupid, maybe it was childish, but she wanted themwith her. She sat on the bed and looked at James and Phillip. They were both looking at her. Phil was dearly upset,touching his mouth to stop its trembling. James wasupset, too, although only someone who knew him aswell as Poppy did would have been able to tell. \"It\u0027s all right,\" Poppy told them. \"Don\u0027t you see?I\u0027mall right, so there\u0027s no excuse for you not to be.\" And the strange thing was, it was the truth. Shewas all right. She felt calm and clear now, as if everything had become very simple. She saw the road ahead of her, and all she had to do was follow it, step by step. Phil came over to squeeze her hand. \"How does this how does this work?\" he asked James huskily. \"First we\u0027ll exchange blood,\" James said-speaking to Poppy. Looking only at her. \"It doesn\u0027t haveto be a lot; you\u0027re right on the border ofchangingalready. Then the two kinds of blood fight it outsort of the last battle, if you see what I mean.\" He smiled faintly and painfully, and Poppy nodded. \"While that\u0027s happening you\u0027ll feel weaker andweaker. And then you\u0027ll just go to sleep. Thechange happens while you\u0027re asleep.\" \"And when do I wake up?\" Poppy asked. \"I\u0027ll give you a kind of posthypnotic suggestion about that. Tell you to wake up whenI come to getyou. Don\u0027t worry about it; I\u0027ve got all the detailsfigured out. All you need to do is rest.\" Phil was running nervous hands through his hair,as if he was just now thinking about what kind ofdetails he and James were going to have to deal with. \"Wait a minute,\" he said in almost a croak. \"When------ whenyou say \u0027sleep\u0027-she\u0027s going to look...\" \"Dead,\" Poppy supplied, when his voice ran out. James gave Phil a cold look. \"Yes. We\u0027ve beenover this.\" \"And then-we\u0027re really going to-what\u0027s going tohappento her?\" James glared. \"It\u0027s okay,\" Poppy said softly. \"Tell him.\" \"You know what\u0027s going to happen,\" James saidthrough clenched teeth to Phillip. \"She can\u0027t just dis appear. We\u0027d have the policeandthe Night peo pleafter us, looking for her. No, it\u0027s got to seem that shedied from the cancer, and that means everything\u0027s got to happen exactly the way it would if she haddied. Phil\u0027s sick expression said he wasn\u0027t at his mostrational. \"You\u0027re sure there isn\u0027t any other way?\" \"No,\"James said. Phil wet his lips. \"Oh, God.\" Poppy herself didn\u0027t want to dwell on it too much.She said fiercely,\"Dealwith it, Phil. You\u0027ve got to. And remember, if it doesn\u0027t happen now it\u0027s goingto happen in a few weeks-for real.\" Phil was holding on to one of the brass bedpostsso hard that his knuckles were pale. But he\u0027d gottenthe point, and there was no one better than Phil atbracing himself. \"You\u0027re right,\" he saidthinly, with the ghost of his old efficient manner. \"Okay, I\u0027m dealing with it.\" \u0027Then let\u0027s get started,\" Poppy said, making hervoice calm and steady. As if she were dealing witheverything effortlessly herself. James said to Phil, \"You don\u0027t want to see thispart. Go out and watch TV for a few minutes.\" Phil hesitated, then nodded and left. \"One thing,\" Poppy said to James as she scootedto the middle_ of the bed. She was still trying desperately to sound casual. \"After the funeral-well, I\u0027ll be asleep, won\u0027t I? I won\u0027t wake up ... you know.In my nice little coffin.\" She looked up at him. \"It\u0027s just that I\u0027m claustrophobic, a little.\" \"You won\u0027t wake up there,\" James said. \"Poppy,I wouldn\u0027t let that happen to you. Trust me; I\u0027ve thought of everything.\" Poppy nodded. I do trust you, she thought. Then she held her arms out to him. He touched her neck, so she tilted her chin back.As the blood was drawn from her, she felt her mind drawn into his. Don\u0027t worry, Poppy. Don\u0027t be afraid. Allhis thoughtswere ferociously protective. And even though it onlyconfirmed that there was something to be afraidof,that this could go wrong, Poppy felt peaceful. Thedirect sense of his love made her calm, flooded her with light. She suddenly felt distance and height and depthspaciousness. As if her horizons had expanded almostto infinity in an instant. As if she\u0027d discovered a new dimension.Asif there were no limits or obstacles to what she and James could do together. She felt ... free. I\u0027m getting light-headed, she realized. She couldfeel herself going limp in James\u0027s arms. Swooninglike a wilting flower. I\u0027vetaken enough,James said in her mind.Thewarmanimalmouth on her throat pulled back.\"Now it\u0027s your turn.\" This time, though, he didn\u0027t make the cut at hiswrist. He took off his T-shirt and, with a quick, impulsive gesture, ran a fingernail along the base of his throat. Oh, Poppy thought. Slowly, almost reverently, she leaned forward. James\u0027s hand supported the back ofher head. Poppy put her arms around him, feelinghis bare skin under the flannel of her nightgown. It was better this way. But if James was right, itwas another last time. She and James could neverexchange blood again. I can\u0027t accept that, Poppythought, but she couldn\u0027tconcentrate on anything for very long. This time, instead of clearing her brain, the wild, intoxicatingvampire blood was making her more confused. Moreheavy and sleepy. James? It\u0027s all right. It\u0027s the beginning of the change. Heavy...sleepy...warm. Lapped in salty oceanwaves. She could almost picture the vampire bloodtrickling through her veins, conquering everything inits path. It was ancient blood, primeval. It was changing her into something old, something that had been around since the dawn of time. Something primitive and basic. Every molecule in her body, changing... Poppy, can you hear me?James was shaking herslightly. Poppy had been so engrossed in the sensations that she hadn\u0027t even realized she wasn\u0027t drinking any longer. James was cradling her. \"Poppy.\" It was an effort to open her eyes. \"I\u0027m all right. Just... sleepy.\" His arms tightened around her, then he laid hergently on the mounded pillows. \"You can rest now. I\u0027ll get Phil.\" But before he went, he kissed her on the forehead. My first kiss, Poppy thought, her eyes drifting shutagain. And I\u0027m comatose. Great. She felt the bed give under weight and looked upto see Phil. Phil looked very nervous, sitting gingerly,staring at Poppy. \"So what\u0027s happening now?\" heasked. \"The vampire blood\u0027s taking over,\" James said. Poppy said, \"I\u0027m really sleepy.\" There was no pain. Just a feeling of wanting toglide away. Her body now felt warm and numb, asif she were insulated by a soft, thick aura. \"Phil? I forgot to say-thank you. For helping out.And everything. You\u0027re a good brother, Phil.\" \"You don\u0027t have to say that now,\" Phil said tersely. \"You can say it later. I\u0027m still going to be here later,you know.\" But I might not be, Poppy thought. This is all a gamble. And I\u0027d never take it, except that the only alternative was to give up without even trying to fight. I fought, didn\u0027t I? At least I fought. \"Yes, you did,\" Phil said, his voice trembling.Poppy hadn\u0027t been aware she was speaking aloud.\"You\u0027ve always been a fighter,\" Phil said. \"I\u0027velearned so much from you.\" Which was funny, because she\u0027d learned so muchfrom him,even if most of it was in the last twenty four hours. She wanted to tell him that, but therewas so much to say, and she was so tired. Her tongue felt thick; her whole body weak and languorous. \"Just...hold my hand,\" she said, and she couldhear that her voice was no louder than a breath.Phillip took one of her hands and James the other. That was good. This was the way to do it, withEeyore and her lion on the pillows beside her andPhil and James holding her hands, keeping her safe and anchored. One of the candles was scented with vanilla, awarm and homey smell. A smell that reminded herof being a kid. Nilla wafers and naptime. That waswhat this was like. Just a nap in Miss Spurgeon\u0027s kindergarten, with the sun slanting across the floorand James on a mat beside her. So safe, so serene... \"Oh, Poppy,\" Phil whispered. James said, \"You\u0027re doing great, kiddo. Everything\u0027s just right.\" That was what Poppy needed to hear. She let herself fall backward into the music, and it waslike falling in a dream, without fear. It was like being a raindrop falling into the ocean that had started you. At the last moment she thought, I\u0027m not ready. But she already knew the answer to that. Nobodywas ever ready. But she\u0027d been stupid-she\u0027d forgotten the mostimportant thing. She\u0027d never told James she lovedhim. Not even when he\u0027d said he loved her. She tried to get enough air, enough strength to sayit. But it was too late. The outside world was goneand she couldn\u0027t feel her body any longer. She was floating in the darkness and the music, and all she could do now was sleep. \"Sleep,\" James said, leaning dose to Poppy. \"Don\u0027twake up until I call you. Just sleep.\" Every muscle in Phil\u0027s body was rigid. Poppylooked so peaceful-pale, with her hair spread out incoppery curls on the pillow, and her eyelashes blackon her cheeks and her lips parted as she breathedgently. She looked like a porcelain baby doll. But the more peaceful she got, the more terrified Phil felt. I can deal with this, he told himself.I haveto. Poppy gave a soft exhalation, and then suddenlyshe was moving. Her chest heaved once, twice. Herhand tightened on Phil\u0027s and her eyes flew openbut she didn\u0027t seem to be seeing anything. She simply looked astonished. \"Poppyl\" Phil grabbed at her, getting a handful offlannel nightgown. She was so small and fragile in side it. \"Poppyl\" The heaving gasps stopped. For one moment Poppywas suspended in air, then her eyes closed and shefell back on the pillows. Her hand was limp in Phil\u0027s. Phil lost all rationality. \"Poppy,\" he said, hearing the dangerous, unbalanced tone in his own voice. \"Poppy, come on.Poppy, wake up!\"-on a rising note. His hands were shaking violently, scrabbling at Poppy\u0027s shoulders. Other hands pushed his away. \"What the hell areyou doing?\" James said quietly. \"Poppy? Poppy?\" Phil kept staring at her. Herchest wasn\u0027t moving. Her face had a look of-innocent release. The kind of newness you only see inbabies. And it was-changing. Taking on a white, transparent look. It was uncanny, ghostlike, and even though Phil had never seen a corpse, he knew instinctively that this was the death pallor. Poppy\u0027s essence had left her. Her body was flat andtoneless, no longer inflated by the vital spirit. Herhand in Phil\u0027s was slack, not like the hand of a sleeping person. Her skin had lost its shine, as if somebodyhad breathed on it softly. Phil threw back his head and let out an animalsound. It wasn\u0027t human. It was a howl. \"You killed her!\" He tumbled off the bed andlurched toward James. \"You said she was just goingto sleep, but you killed herl She\u0027s dead!\" James didn\u0027t back away from the attack. Instead,he grabbed Phil and dragged him out intothe hallway. \"Hearing is the last sense to go,\" he snarled inPhillip\u0027s ear. \"She may be able tohear you.\" Phil wrenched free and ran toward the living room. He didn\u0027t know what he was doing, he only knew that he needed to destroy things. Poppy wasdead. She was gone. He grabbed the couch andflipped it over, then kicked the coffee table over, too. He snatched up a lamp, yanked its cord out of thesocket, and threw it toward the fireplace. \"Stop it!\" James shouted over the crash. Phil sawhim and ran at him. The sheer force of his charge knocked James backward into the wall. They fell tothe floor together in a heap. \"You-killed her!\" Phil gasped, trying to get hishands around James\u0027s throat. Silver.James\u0027s eyes blazed like the molten metal.He grabbed Phil\u0027s wrists in a painful grip. \"Stop itnow,Phillip,\" he hissed. Something about the way he said it made Phil stop.Almost sobbing, he struggled to get air into his lungs. \"I\u0027ll killyouif I have to, to keep Poppy safe,\" James said, his voice still savage and menacing. \"And she\u0027sonly safe if you stop this and do exactly what I tell youto.Exactlywhat I tell you. Understand?\" He shook Philhard, nearly banging Phil\u0027s head into the wall. Strangely enough, it was the right thing to say.James was saying he cared about Poppy. And weird as it might sound, Phil had come to trust James to tell the truth. The raging red insanity in Phil\u0027s brain died away. He took a long breath. \"Okay. I understand,\" he said hoarsely. He was used to being in charge-both of himself and of otherpeople. He didn\u0027t like James giving him orders. Butin this case there was no help for it. \"But-she isdead, isn\u0027t she?\" \"It depends on your definition,\" James said, lettinggo and slowly pushing himself off the floor. Hescanned the living room, his mouth grim. \"Nothingwent wrong, Phil. Everything went just the way itwas supposed to-except for this. I was going to letyour parents come back and find her, but we don\u0027thave that option now. There isn\u0027t any way to explain this mess, except the.truth.\" \"The truth being?\" \"That you went in there and found her dead andwent berserk. And then I called your parents-you know what restaurant they\u0027re at, don\u0027t you?\" \"It\u0027s Valentino\u0027s. My mom said they were lucky toget in.\" \"Okay. That\u0027ll work. But first we have to clean upthe bedroom. Get all the candles and stuff out. It\u0027sgot to look as if she just went to sleep, like anyother night.\" Phil glanced at the sliding glass door. It was justgetting dark. But then Poppy had been sleeping a lotthese last few days. \"We\u0027ll say she got tired and toldus to go watch TV,\" he said slowly, trying to conquer his dazed feeling and be clearheaded. \"And then Iwent in after a while and checked on her.\" \"Right,\" James said, with a faint smile that didn\u0027treach his eyes. It didn\u0027t take long to clear out the bedroom. Thehardest thing was that Phil had to keep looking atPoppy, and every time he looked, his heart lurched.She looked so tiny, so delicate-limbed. A Christmas angel in June. He hated to take the stuffed animals away fromher. \"She is going to wake up, isn\u0027t she?\" he said, without looking at James. \"God, I hope so,\" James said, and his voice wasvery tired. It sounded more like a prayer than a wish.\"If she doesn\u0027t you won\u0027t have to come after me witha stake, Phil. I\u0027ll take care of it myself.\" Phil was shocked-and angry. \"Don\u0027t be stupid,\"he said brutally. \"If Poppy stood for anything-if she standsfor anything-it\u0027s for life. Throwing your life away would be like a slap in her face. Besides, evenif it goes wrong now, you did your best. Blaming yourself is just stupid.\" James looked at him blankly, and Phil realizedthey\u0027d managed to surprise each other. Then Jamesnodded slowly. \"Thanks.\" It was a milestone, the first time they\u0027d ever beenon precisely the same wavelength. Phillip felt an oddconnection between them. He looked away and said briskly, \"Is it time to callthe restaurant?\" James glanced at his watch. \"In just a fewminutes.\" \"If we wait too long they\u0027re going to have left bythe time we call.\" \"That doesn\u0027tmatter.What matters is that we don\u0027t have any paramedics trying to resuscitate her, or taking her to the hospital. Which means she\u0027s gotto be cold by the time anybody gets here.\" Phil felt a wave of dizzy horror. \"You\u0027re a coldblooded snake after all.\" \"I\u0027m just practical,\" James said wearily, as if speaking to a child. He touched one of Poppy\u0027s marblewhite hands where it lay on the bedspread. \"Allright. It\u0027s time. I\u0027m going to call. You can go berserkagain if you want to.\" Phil shook his head. He didn\u0027t have the energyanymore. But he did feel like crying, which was al most as good. Crying and crying like a kid who was lost and hurt. \"Get my mom,\" he said thickly. He knelt on the floor beside Poppy\u0027s bed andwaited. Poppy\u0027s music was off and he could hear theTV in the family room. He had no sense of time passing until he also heard a car in the driveway. Then he leaned his forehead against Poppy\u0027s mattress. His tears were absolutely genuine. At that moment he was sure he\u0027d lost her forever. \"Brace yourself,\" James said from behind him.\"They\u0027re here.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-secret-vampire-night-world-1/page-10.html","bookId":2076,"book":{"id":2076,"title":"Night World : Secret Vampire (Night World #1)","description":"Storyline: Secret Vampire (Night World Book 1) Love was never so scary...The Night World is all around us - a secret society of vampires, werewolves, witches and creatures of darkness.
