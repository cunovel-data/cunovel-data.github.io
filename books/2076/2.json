{"id":111732,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"\"Poppy!\" Poppy could hear her mother\u0027s voice, but she couldn\u0027t see anything. The kitchen floor was obscured by dancing black dots. \"Poppy, are you all right?\" Now Poppy felt hermother\u0027s hands grasping her upper arms, holding her anxiously. The pain was easing and her vision was coming back. As she straightened up, she saw James in front ofher. His face was almost expressionless, but Poppy knew him well enough to recognize the worry in hiseyes. He was holding the milk carton, she realized. He must have caught it on the fly as she droppedit--amazing reflexes, Poppy thought vaguely. Really amazing. Phillip was on his feet. \"Are you okay? Whathappened?\" \"I-don\u0027t know.\" Poppy looked around, thenshrugged, embarrassed. Now that she felt better shewished they weren\u0027t all staring at her so hard. Theway to deal with the pain was to ignore it, to notthink about it. \"It\u0027s just this stupid pain-I think it\u0027s gastrowhatchmacallit. You know, something I ate.\" Poppy\u0027s mother gave her daughter the barest fraction of a shake. \"Poppy, this is not gastroenteritis.You were having some pain before-nearly a monthago, wasn\u0027t it? Is this the same kind of pain?\" Poppy squirmed uncomfortably. As a matter offact, the pain had never really gone away. Somehow,in the excitement of end-of-the-year activities, she\u0027dmanaged to disregard it, and by now she was used to working around it. \"Sort of,\" she temporized. \"But That was enough for Poppy\u0027s mother. She gavePoppy a little squeeze and headed for the kitchen telephone. \"I know you don\u0027t like doctors, but I\u0027mcalling Dr. Franklin. I want him to take a look at you. This isn\u0027t something we can ignore.\" \"Oh, Mom, it\u0027s vacation....\" Her mother covered the mouthpiece of the phone.\"Poppy, this is nonnegotiable. Go get dressed.\" Poppy groaned, but she could see it was no use.She beckoned to James, who was looking thoughtfully into a middle distance. \"Let\u0027s at least listen to the CD before I have to go.\" He glanced at the CD as if he\u0027d forgotten it, and put down the milk carton. Phillip followed them into the hallway. \"Hey, buddy, you wait out here while she gets dressed.\" James barely turned. \"Get a life, Phil,\" he said almost absently. \"Just keep your hands off my sister, you deve.\" Poppy just shook her head as she went into her room. As if James cared about seeing her undressed. If only,she thought grimly, pulling a pair of shortsout of a drawer. She stepped into them, still shaking her head. James was her best friend, her very bestfriend, and she was his. But he\u0027d never shown even the slightest desire to get his hands on her. Sometimes she wondered if he realized she was a girl. Someday I\u0027m going to makehim see, she thought,and shouted out the door for him. James came in and smiled at her. It was a smile other people rarely saw, not a taunting or ironic grin, but a nice little smile, slightly crooked. \"Sorry about the doctor thing,\" Poppy said. \"No. You should go.\" James gave her a keenglance. \"Your mom\u0027s right, you know. This has been going on way too long. You\u0027ve lost weight; it\u0027s keeping you up at night-\" Poppy looked at him, startled. She hadn\u0027t told anybody about how the pain was worse at night, not even James. But sometimes James just knewthings. As if he could read her mind. \"I just know you, that\u0027s all,\" he said, and then gaveher a mischievous sideways glance as she stared at him. He unwrapped the CD. Poppy shrugged and flopped on her bed, staring atthe ceiling. \"Anyway, I wish Mom would let me have oneday of vacation,\" she said. She craned her neckto look at James speculatively. \"I wish I had a mom like yours. Mine\u0027s always worrying and trying to fix me.\" \"And mine doesn\u0027t really care if I come or go. Sowhich is worse?\" James said wryly. \"Your parents let you have your own apartment. \" \"In a building they own. Because it\u0027s cheaper thanhiring a manager.\" James shook his head, his eyeson the CD he was putting in the player. \"Don\u0027t knockyour parents, kid. You\u0027re luckier than you know.\" Poppy thought about that as the CD started. Sheand James both liked trance-the underground electronic sound that had come from Europe. James likedthe techno beat. Poppy loved it because it was real music, raw and unpasteurized, made by people who believed in it. People who had the passion, not people who had the money. Besides, world music made her feel a part of otherplaces. She loved the differentness of it, the alienness. Come to think of it, maybe that was what she likedabout James, too. His differentness. She tilted her head to look at him as the strange rhythms of Burundi drumming filled the air. She knew James better than anyone, but there wasalways something, something about him that was closed off to her. Something about him that nobody could reach. Other people took it for arrogance, or coldness, oraloofness, but it wasn\u0027t really any of those things. It was just differentness. He was more different thanany of the exchangestudents at school. Time after time, Poppy felt she had almost put her finger on thedifference, but it always slipped away. And more than once, especially late at night when they were listening to music or watching the ocean, she\u0027d felthe was about to tell her. And she\u0027d always felt that if he didtell her, itwould be something important, something as shocking and lovely as having a stray cat speak to her. Just now she looked at James, at his dean, carvenprofile and at the brown waves of hair on his forehead, and thought, He looks sad. \"Jamie, nothing\u0027s wrong, is it? I mean, at home, oranything?\" She was the only person on the planet allowed to call him Jamie. Not even Jacklyn or Michaela had ever tried that. \"What could be wrong at home?\" he said, with asmile that didn\u0027t reach his eyes. Then he shook his head dismissively. \"Don\u0027t worry about it, Poppy. It\u0027snothing important-just a relative threatening to visit. An unwanted relative.\" Then the smile didreach his eyes, glinting there. \"Or maybe I\u0027m justworried about you,\" he said. Poppy started to say, \"Oh, as if, \"but instead she found herself saying, oddly, \"Are you really?\" Her seriousness seemed to strike some chord. Hissmile disappeared, and Poppy found that they were simply looking at each other without any insulating humor between them. Just gazing into each other\u0027s eyes. James looked uncertain, almost vulnerable. \"Poppy�� Poppy swallowed. \"Yes?\" He opened his mouth-and then he got upabruptly and went to adjust her 170-watt Tall-boy speakers. When he turned back, his gray eyes were dark and fathomless. \"Sure, if you were really sick, I\u0027d be worried,\" hesaid lightly. \"That\u0027s what friends are for, right?\" Poppy deflated. \"Right,\" she said wistfully, andthen gave him a determined smile. \"But you\u0027re not sick,\" he said. \"It\u0027s just somethingyou need to get taken care of. The doctor\u0027ll probably give you some antibiotics or something-with a bigneedle,\" he added wickedly. \"Oh, shut up,\" Poppy said. He knew she was terrified of injections. Just the thought of a needle entering her skin ... \"Here comes your mom,\" James said, glancing atthe door, which was ajar. Poppy didn\u0027t see how he could hear anybody coming-the music was loud andthe hallway was carpeted. But an instant later her mother pushed the door open. \"All right, sweetheart,\" she said briskly. \"Dr.Franklin says come right in. I\u0027m sorry, James, but I\u0027m going to have to take Poppy away.\" \"That\u0027s okay. I can come back this afternoon.\" Poppy knew when she was defeated. She allowedher mother to tow her to the garage, ignoring James\u0027s miming of someone receiving a large injection. An hour later she was lying on Dr. Franklin\u0027s examining table, eyes politely averted as his gentle fingers probed her abdomen. Dr. Franklin was tall, lean,and graying, with the air of a country doctor. Some body you could trust absolutely. \"The pain is here?\" he said. \"Yeah-but it sort of goes into my back. Or maybe I just pulled a muscle back there or something The gentle, probing fingers moved, then stopped. Dr. Franklin\u0027s face changed. And somehow, in that moment, Poppy knew it wasn\u0027t a pulled muscle. Itwasn\u0027t an upset stomach; it wasn\u0027t anything simple; and things were about to change forever. All Dr. Franklin said was, \"You know, I\u0027d like toarrange for a test on this.\" His voice was dry and thoughtful, but panic curled through Poppy anyway. She couldn\u0027t explain what was happening inside her-some sort of dreadful premonition, like a black pit opening in the ground in front of her. \"Why?\" her mother was asking the doctor. \"Well.\" Dr. Franklin smiled and pushed his glassesup. He tapped two fingers on the examining table.\"Just as part of a process of elimination, really. Poppysays she\u0027s been having pain in the upper abdomen, pain that radiates to her back, pain that\u0027s worse atnight. She\u0027s lost her appetite recently, and she\u0027s lost weight. And her gallbladder is palpable-that meansI can feel that it\u0027s enlarged. Now, those are symptomsof a lot of things, and a sonogram will help rule out some of them.\" Poppy calmed down. She couldn\u0027t remember whata gallbladder did but she was pretty sure she didn\u0027t need it.Anything involving an organ with such a silly name couldn\u0027t be serious. Dr. Franklin was goingon, talking about the pancreas and pancreatitis andpalpable livers, and Poppy\u0027s mother was nodding as if she understood. Poppy didn\u0027t understand, but thepanic was gone. It was as if a cover had been whisked neatly over the black pit, leaving no sign that it had ever been there. \"You can get the sonogram done at Children\u0027s Hospital across the street,\" Dr. Franklin wassaying. \"Come back here after it\u0027s finished.\" Poppy\u0027s mother was nodding, calm, serious, andefficient. Like Phil. Or Cliff. Okay, we\u0027ll get this taken care of. Poppy felt just slightly important.Nobody sheknew had been to a hospital for tests. Her mother ruffled her hair as they walked out ofDr. Franklin\u0027s office. \"Well, Poppet. What have you done to yourself now?\" Poppy smiled impishly. She was fully recoveredfrom her earlier worry. \"Maybe I\u0027ll have to have an operation and I\u0027ll have an interesting scar,\" she said,to amuse her mother. \"Let\u0027s hope not,\" her mother said, unamused. The Suzanne G. Monteforte Children\u0027s Hospitalwas a handsome gray building with sinuous curve sand giant picture windows. Poppy looked thoughtfully into the gift shop as they passed. It was clearly akid\u0027s gift shop, full of rainbow Slinkys and stuffed animals that a visiting adult could buy as a last-minute present. A girl came out of the shop. She was a little olderthan Poppy, maybe seventeen or eighteen. She was pretty, with an expertly made-up face-and a cutebandanna which didn\u0027t quite conceal the fact that she had no hair. She looked happy, round-cheeked,with earrings dangling jauntily beneath the band anna-but Poppy felt a stab of sympathy. Sympathy...and fear. That girl was reallysick. Which was what hospitals were for, of course-for really sick people. Suddenly Poppy wanted to get herown tests over with and get out of here. The sonogram wasn\u0027t painful, but it was vaguelydisturbing. A technician smeared some kind of jelly over Poppy\u0027s middle, then ran a cold scanner over it,shooting sound waves into her, taking pictures of her insides. Poppy found her mind returning to the prettygirl with no hair. To distract herself, she thought about James. And for some reason what came to mind was the first time she\u0027d seen James, the day he came to kindergarten. He\u0027d been a pale, slight boy with big gray eyes and something subtly weirdabout him that made thebigger boys start picking on him immediately. On the playground they ganged up on him like houndsaround a fox-until Poppy saw what was happening. Even at five she\u0027d had a great right hook. She\u0027dburst into the group, slapping faces and kicking shins until the big boys went running. Then she\u0027d turned to James. \"Wanna be friends?\" After a brief hesitation he\u0027d nodded shyly. Therehad been something oddly sweet in his smile. But Poppy had soon found that her new friend wasstrange in small ways. When the class lizard died, he\u0027d picked up the corpse without revulsion andasked Poppy if she wanted to hold it. The teacher had been horrified. He knew where to find dead animals, too-he\u0027dshown her a vacant lot where several rabbit carcasseslay in the tall brown grass. He was matter-of-factabout it. When he got older, the big kids stopped pickingon him. He grew up to be as tall as any of them, and surprisingly strong and quick-and he developed areputation for being tough and dangerous. When he got angry, something almost frightening shone in hisgray eyes. He never got angry with Poppy, though. They\u0027dremained best friends all these years. When they\u0027d reached junior high, he\u0027d started having girlfriends all the girls at school wanted himbut he never kept any of them long. And he never confided in them;to them he was a mysterious, secretive bad boy. Only Poppy saw the other side of him, the vulnerable, caring side. \"Okay,\" the technician said, bringing Poppy backto the present with a jerk. \"You\u0027re done; let\u0027s wipe this jelly off you.\" \"So what did it show?\" Poppy asked, glancing upat the monitor. \"Oh, your own doctor will tell you that. The radiologist will read the results and call them over to your doctor\u0027s office.\" The technician\u0027s voice was absolutely neutral-so neutral that Poppy looked ather sharply. Back in Dr. Franklin\u0027s office, Poppy fidgeted whileher mother paged through out-of-date magazines. When the nurse said \"Mrs. Hilgard,\" they bothstood up. \"Uh-no,\" the nurse said, looking flustered. \"Mrs.Hilgard, the doctor just wants toseeyou for a minute-alone.\" Poppy and her mother looked at each other. Then,slowly, Poppy\u0027s mother put down her People magazine and followed the nurse. Poppy stared after her. Now, what on earth . . . Dr. Franklin had neverdone that before. Poppy realized that her heart was beating hard. Notfast, just hard. Bang...bang... bang, in the middle of her chest, shaking her insides. Making her feelunreal and giddy. Don\u0027t think about it. It\u0027s probably nothing. Reada magazine. But her fingers didn\u0027t seem to work properly. When she finally got the magazine open, her eyes ran over the words without delivering them to herbrain. What are they talking about in there? What\u0027s going on?It\u0027s been so long.... It kept getting longer. As Poppy waited, she foundherself vacillating between two modes of thought. 1) Nothing serious was wrong with her and her motherwas going to come out and laugh at her for even imagining there was, and 2) Something awful waswrong with her and she was going to have to go through some dreadful treatment to get well. The covered pit and the open pit. When the pit was covered, it seemed laughable, and she felt embarrassed for having such melodramatic thoughts. But when it was open, she felt as if all her life before this had been adream, and now she was hitting hard reality at last. I wish I could call James, she thought. At last the nurse said, \"Poppy? Come on in.\" Dr. Franklin\u0027s office was wood-paneled, with certificates and diplomas hanging on the walls. Poppy sat down in a leather chair and tried not to be tooobvious about scanning her mother\u0027s face. Her mother looked...too calm. Calm with strainunderneath. She was smiling, but it was an odd,slightly unsteady smile. Oh, God, Poppy thought. Something isgoing on. \"Now, there\u0027s no cause for alarm,\" the doctor said,and immediately Poppy became more alarmed. Her palms stuck to the leather of the chair arms. \"Something showed up in your sonogram that\u0027s alittle unusual, and I\u0027d like to do a couple of othertests,\" Dr. Franklin said, his voice slow and measured, soothing. \"One of the tests requires that you fast from midnight the day before you take it. But your mom says you didn\u0027t eat breakfast today.\" Poppy said mechanically, \"I ate one Frosted Flake.\" \"OneFrosted Flake? Well, I think we can countthat as fasting. We\u0027ll do the tests today, and I think it\u0027s best to admit you to the hospital for them. Now, the tests are called a CAT scan and an ERCP-that\u0027s short for something even I can\u0027t pronounce.\" Hesmiled. Poppy just stared at him. \"There\u0027s nothing frightening about either of thesetests,\" he said gently. \"The CAT scan is like an X ray. The ERCP involves passing a tube down the throat, through the stomach, and into the pancreas. Then we inject into the tube a liquid that will show up onX rays .\" His mouth kept moving, but Poppy had stoppedhearing the words. She was more frightened than she could remember being in a long time. I was just joking about the interesting scar, shethought. I don\u0027t want a real disease. I don\u0027t want to go to the hospital, and I don\u0027t want any tubes down my throat. She looked at her mother in mute appeal. Her mother took her hand. \"It\u0027s no big deal, sweetheart. We\u0027ll just go home andpack a few things for you; then we\u0027ll come back.\" \"I have to go into the hospital today?\" \"I think that would be best,\" Dr. Franklin said. Poppy\u0027s hand tightened on her mother\u0027s. Her mind was a humming blank. When they left the office, her mother said, \"Thankyou, Owen.\" Poppy had never heard her call Dr. Franklin by his first name before. Poppy didn\u0027t ask why. She didn\u0027t say anything asthey walked out of the building and got in the car. As they drove home, her mother began to chat aboutordinary things in a light, calm voice, and Poppy made herself answer. Pretending that everything wasnormal, while all the time the terrible sick feeling raged inside her. It was only when they were in her bedroom, packing mystery books and cotton pajamas into a small suitcase, that she asked almost casually, \"So whatexactly does he think is wrong with me?\" Her mother didn\u0027t answer immediately. She waslooking down at the suitcase. Finally she said, \"Well, he\u0027s not sure anything is wrong.\" \"But what does he think?He must think something. And he was talking about my pancreas-Imean, it sounds like he thinks there\u0027s somethingwrong with my pancreas. I thought he was looking at my gallbladderor whatever. I didn\u0027t even know that my pancreas was involvedin this....\" \"Sweetheart.\" Her mother took her by the shoulders, and Poppy realized she was getting a little over wrought. She took a deep breath. \"I just want to know the truth, okay? I just wantto have some idea of what\u0027s going on. It\u0027s my body, and I\u0027ve got a right to know what they\u0027re lookingfor-don\u0027t I?\" It was a brave speech, and she didn\u0027t mean any of it. What she really wanted was reassurance, a prom ise that Dr. Franklin was looking for something trivial. That the worst that could happen wouldn\u0027t be so bad. She didn\u0027t get it. \"Yes, you do have a right to know.\" Her motherlet a long breath out, then spoke slowly. \"Poppy, Dr. Franklin was concerned about your pancreas allalong. Apparently things can happen in the pancreas that cause changes in other organs, like the gallblad der and liver. When Dr. Franklin felt those changes, he decided to check things out with a sonogram.\" Poppy swallowed. \"And he said the sonogramwas-unusual. How unusual?\" \"Poppy, this is all preliminary....\" Her mothersaw her face and sighed. She went on reluctantly.\" The sonogram showed that there might be something in your pancreas. Something that shouldn\u0027t bethere. That\u0027s why Dr. Franklin wants the other tests;they\u0027ll tell us for sure. But-\" \"Something that shouldn\u0027t be there? You mean ... like a tumor? Like ...cancer?\" Strange, it was hard to say the words. Her mother nodded once. \"Yes. Like cancer.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-world-secret-vampire-night-world-1/page-2.html","bookId":2076,"book":{"id":2076,"title":"Night World : Secret Vampire (Night World #1)","description":"Storyline: Secret Vampire (Night World Book 1) Love was never so scary...The Night World is all around us - a secret society of vampires, werewolves, witches and creatures of darkness.
