I’d thought going to see Eva and telling her I loved her would do something. Low had got me to believe someone like Eva could love me. She was wrong. Eva had chosen her family over me, again. She always would. “Smile, you’re depressing as shit,” Rock grumbled as he slammed a beer down in front of me. “Thanks,” I replied. “Never thought I’d see you with a broken heart. Out of all of the guys I never thought it’d be you. It’s like I’ve walked into the fucking twilight zone and can’t get out.” I grunted and took a long swallow of my beer. “Wanna dance, Cage?” I didn’t even try to remember her name. She was one of the mistakes. I had so many. I just shook my head no and took another drink. “Sorry honey but he ain’t real good company right now,” Trisha apologized for me. “If you change your mind—“ she started “I won’t,” I interrupted her. She got the hint and walked off. I never even looked at her face. They all looked the same anyway. They all weren’t Eva. “You think maybe you could be less scary?” Trisha asked. “No.” Rock chuckled, “Let it go, babe. He’s nursing a broken heart and you know that boy ain’t ever had one before. It’s a new experience for him.” “You may want to warn Krit before they take a break. I don’t want Cage and him getting into it because he can’t keep his mouth shut.” I didn’t belong here. I didn’t want to be here. I laid a couple twenties on the table and stood up. “I’m leaving, anyway. I’ve had all the fun I can handle for the night.” “I hate for you to be alone. You want me to call Low?” Low was the last person I wanted to talk to. She didn’t understand that it wasn’t an easy fix. “No. I just want to go home and go to bed. I need to be at the gym in the morning.” “Later,” Rock added with a nod and I turned and headed for the door. I noticed that Jackdown had stopped playing and the crowd had gone silent. That was odd and unheard of. I paused and looked back at the stage to see what it was I was missing that had quieted the crowd. “Hello,” Eva’s voice said over the microphone. What the fuck? “I don’t, uh, I don’t normally play in front of people. Actually, I’ve never really played in front of people other than my family.” I began walking toward the sound of her voice. I pushed through the crowd and kept my eyes focused on the stage until I was close enough to see her. She stood in the spotlight with her hair pulled back in a ponytail and her guitar across her chest. Those blue eyes that had stopped my heart the first time she looked at me found me in the crowd. A small smile touched her lips. “But I have this song that I wrote for this amazing guy who completely changed my life and I need him to hear it.” She was going to play and sing in front of a bar full of people. I took another step toward her and she began to play. “I didn’t want to see you but you invaded my world Every dark corner you found a way in Bringing color to the lifeless and lost. I didn’t want to touch you but you reached inside me Every lost memory you found a way to melt the frost Until the small closed world inside opened up into the sea You made me love you by the smile on your face, the kindness in your eyes and the heat of your skin. One kiss makes all that’s been hurt fade away. You made me love you for the man inside. The one no one sees but me. The man who listens to what my heart has to say. I didn’t want to love you but you’re impossible not to love. Every perfect moment I spend in your arms draws me closer Showing me that life isn’t over because its path takes a sudden turn I didn’t see you coming when you arrived Nothing prepared me for the gift of a second chance. I’ve been loved in life but all that matters now is that I’m loved by you You made me love you by the smile on your face, the kindness in your eyes and the heat of your skin. One kiss makes all that’s been hurt fade away. You made me love you for the man inside. The one no one sees but me. The man who listens to what my heart has to say. I’ll spend eternity in your arms if you’ll trust me when I say that I love you. The roar of the crowd dwindled away as I jumped up on the stage and pulled her into my arms. Eva Cage picked me up and carried me off the stage while the crowd cheered and shouted all kinds of suggestions at him. He kept walking until he got to a backdoor. He opened it and pushed me into a room that looked like a dressing room. Red velvet couches and large mirrors lined the walls. Closing the door behind him he clicked the lock. Then he spun me around and pressed me up against the door. His mouth covered mine in a hungry growl and I wrapped my legs around his waist and grabbed onto his thick corded arms. His mouth pressed hungrily against mine as he tasted me thoroughly. Once he had me panting for breath he broke the kiss and buried his head in the curve of my neck. “I fucking love you.” I giggled. That was a very Cage response. “I do. I swear it. I should have never left. I was scared. I was stupid. I will make it up to you for the rest of our lives.” “Do I get to decide the ways you can make it up to me?” I teased and I could feel his mouth smile against my neck. “As long as it’s naughty,” he replied. I ran my hands through his hair and down his arms as we stood there. “You played for me,” he said, lifting his head so he could look into my eyes. “I did.” “It was amazing.” He pressed a kiss to my jawline. “Will you sing it for me again sometime?” “Yes,” I replied, unable to keep from laughing. “I like this skirt,” he whispered as his hands slid up my thighs and cupped my panty-covered bottom. “I like it a lot.” His hands slid into my panties. When his finger slid inside me I cried out and he covered my mouth with his. I kissed him back with all the need and desire rolling through me. I began grabbing at his shirt as we kissed frantically. Cage let me slide down his body and stand up so I could pull his shirt off. I slung it on the floor and my mouth covered his nipple causing him to moan. “Fuck, I’m getting the other one done tomorrow,” he swore. The idea of it made me a little crazier. I’d been replaying how incredible sex was with Cage every night in bed. Now I had him here and he was all mine. I dropped to my knees to begin unfastening his jeans and then jerked them down. He reached for me and picked me up pushing me back against the door. He reached under my skirt, ripped my panties off and threw them aside. My shirt went next and his mouth covered my nipple as he lifted me up against the door and slid inside me with one swift thrust. I cried out and Cage kissed me hard and thrust his tongue into my mouth the same way he was thrusting into me. Pulling back he stared down at me. “Fuuuuuck,” he groaned and I lifted my hips to press him in harder. “Easy baby,” he said through clenched teeth. “Please, Cage I want it hard.” His eyes flashed bright blue. He pumped into me hard and I cried out encouraging him. Each moan of pleasure made him a little wilder. I wanted him wild. “Ohgod, Eva,” he groaned and pumped faster. “Yes, yes, YES.” “Oh, fuck baby,” he cried out and began pounding into me causing the door behind us to rattle. “Harder, Cage. Harder,” I begged, “AHHHH!” Our bodies grew sweaty and our frenzied need for release took over. Neither of us cared about the fact we weren’t muffling our sounds. We just needed release. “SHIT! I don’t have on a condom,” Cage growled as he tensed underneath me. “Don’t care, don’t stop,” I panted desperately. “You sure?” he asked as his body trembled under my hands. “Please GOD just don’t stop,” I cried out. Cage let out a roar and began pumping into me again which sent me spiraling off into bliss. His cry of pleasure followed mine. I managed to catch my breath and a smile tugged at my lips. I was taking the bad boy off the market for good.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/while-it-lasts-sea-breeze-3/page-25.html","bookId":1987,"book":{"id":1987,"title":"While It Lasts (Sea Breeze #3)","description":"Storyline: While It Lasts (Sea Breeze #3) Maybe driving home after a few (or more) shots of tequila had been a bad idea, but hell, he did it all the time. The cops had to have been freaking bored to have pulled him over. He wasn’t even swerving! That’s Cage York’s story and he’s sticking to it. Unfortunately, his baseball coach isn’t buying it. Cage has a free ride to the local junior college for baseball -- or he did, until he’d gotten a DUI. Now, Cage has to decide: does he drop out and give up his dream of getting noticed by a college in the SEC, and possibly making it into the Major Leagues -- or does he give in to his coach’s demands and spend his summer baling hay? Eva Brooks planned out her life step by step when she was eight years old. Not once over the years had she lost sight of her goals. Josh Beasley, her next door neighbor, had been the center of those goals. He’d been her first boyfriend at seven, her first kiss at ten, her first date at fifteen, and her first tragedy at eighteen. The moment she’d received the phone call from Josh’s mother saying he’d been killed along with four other soldiers just north of Baghdad, Eva’s carefully planned life imploded in the worst way possible. Cage isn’t real happy with his closet-sized bedroom in the back of a foul smelling barn, or his daily interactions with cows, but he knows that if he doesn’t make his coach happy then he can kiss his scholarship goodbye. Only a sick and twisted man would decide his punishment was to be working on a farm all summer. No hot babes in bikinis waiting to meet a Southern boy to make her vacation complete. Just him and the damned cows. Oh -- and an uptight, snarky brunette with the biggest blue eyes he’s every seen. But she doesn’t count, because as hard as he’s tried to charm her out of her panties - he’s pretty sure she’d rather see him hung from the rafters than let him get a taste of her pretty little lips.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/while-it-lasts-sea-breeze-3.jpg","author":"Abbi Glines","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/while-it-lasts-sea-breeze-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:11 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:27:59 AM"}}
