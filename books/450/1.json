{"id":14853,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"BEHIND THE GYM\n IT was a dull autumn day and Jill Pole was crying behind the gym.\n She was crying because they had been bullying her. This is not going to be a school story, so I shall say as little as possible about Jill\u0027s school, which is not a pleasant subject. It was \"Co-educational,\" a school for both boys and girls, what used to be called a \"mixed\" school; some said it was not nearly so mixed as the minds of the people who ran it. These people had the idea that boys and girls should be allowed to do what they liked. And unfortunately what ten or fifteen of the biggest boys and girls liked best was bullying the others. All sorts of things, horrid things, went on which at an ordinary school would have been found out and stopped in half a term; but at this school they weren\u0027t. Or even if they were, the people who did them were not expelled or punished. The Head said they were interesting psychological cases and sent for them and talked to them for hours. And if you knew the right sort of things to say to the Head, the main result was that you became rather a favourite than otherwise.\n That was why Jill Pole was crying on that dull autumn day on the damp little path which runs between the back of the gym and the shrubbery. And she hadn\u0027t nearly finished her cry when a boy came round the corner of the gym whistling, with his hands in his pockets. He nearly ran into her.\n \"Can\u0027t you look where you\u0027re going?\" said Jill Pole.\n \"All right,\" said the boy, \"you needn\u0027t start -\" and then he noticed her face. \"I say, Pole,\" he said, \"what\u0027s up?\"\n Jill only made faces; the sort you make when you\u0027re trying to say something but find that if you speak you\u0027ll start crying again.\n \"It\u0027s Them, I suppose - as usual,\" said the boy grimly, digging his hands farther into his pockets.\n Jill nodded. There was no need for her to say anything, even if she could have said it. They both knew.\n \"Now, look here,\" said the boy, \"there\u0027s no good us all -\"\n He meant well, but he did talk rather like someone beginning a lecture. Jill suddenly flew into a temper (which is quite a likely thing to happen if you have been interrupted in a cry).\n \"Oh, go away and mind your own business,\" she said. \"Nobody asked you to come barging in, did they? And you\u0027re a nice person to start telling us what we all ought to do, aren\u0027t you? I suppose you mean we ought to spend all our time sucking up to Them, and currying favour, and dancing attendance on Them like you do.\"\n \"Oh, Lor!\" said the boy, sitting down on the grassy bank at the edge of the shrubbery and very quickly getting up again because the grass was soaking wet. His name unfortunately was Eustace Scrubb, but he wasn\u0027t a bad sort.\n \"Pole!\" he said. \"Is that fair? Have I been doing anything of the sort this term? Didn\u0027t I stand up to Carter about the rabbit? And didn\u0027t I keep the secret about Spivvins - under torture too? And didn\u0027t I -\"\n \"I d-don\u0027t know and I don\u0027t care,\" sobbed Jill.\n Scrubb saw that she wasn\u0027t quite herself yet and very sensibly offered her a peppermint. He had one too. Presently Jill began to see things in a clearer light.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Scrubb,\" she said presently. \"I wasn\u0027t fair. You have done all that - this term.\"\n \"Then wash out last term if you can,\" said Eustace. \"I was a different chap then. I was - gosh! what a little tick I was.\"\n \"Well, honestly, you were,\" said Jill.\n \"You think there has been a change, then?\" said Eustace.\n \"It\u0027s not only me,\" said Jill. \"Everyone\u0027s been saying so. They\u0027ve noticed it. Eleanor Blakiston heard Adela Pennyfather talking about it in our changing room yesterday. She said, `Someone\u0027s got hold of that Scrubb kid. He\u0027s quite unmanageable this term. We shall have to attend to him next.\u0027\"\n Eustace gave a shudder. Everyone at Experiment House knew what it was like being \"attended to\" by Them.\n Both children were quiet for a moment. The drops dripped off the laurel leaves.\n \"Why were you so different last term?\" said Jill presently.\n \"A lot of queer things happened to me in the hols,\" said Eustace mysteriously.\n \"What sort of things?\" asked Jill.\n Eustace didn\u0027t say anything for quite a long time. Then he said:\n \"Look here, Pole, you and I hate this place about as much as anybody can hate anything, don\u0027t we?\"\n \"I know I do,\" said Jill.\n \"Then I really think I can trust you.\"\n \"Dam\u0027 good of you,\" said Jill.\n \"Yes, but this is a really terrific secret. Pole, I say, are you good at believing things? I mean things that everyone here would laugh at?\"\n \"I\u0027ve never had the chance,\" said Jill, \"but I think I would be.\"\n \"Could you believe me if I said I\u0027d been right out of the world - outside this world - last hols?\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t know what you meant.\"\n \"Well, don\u0027t let\u0027s bother about that then. Supposing I told you I\u0027d been in a place where animals can talk and where there are - er - enchantments and dragons - and well, all the sorts of things you have in fairy-tales.\" Scrubb felt terribly awkward as he said this and got red in the face.\n \"How did you get there?\" said Jill. She also felt curiously shy.\n \"The only way you can - by Magic,\" said Eustace almost in a whisper. \"I was with two cousins of mine. We were just - whisked away. They\u0027d been there before.\"\n Now that they were talking in whispers Jill somehow felt it easier to believe. Then suddenly a horrible suspicion came over her and she said (so fiercely that for the moment she looked like a tigress):\n \"If I find you\u0027ve been pulling my leg I\u0027ll never speak to you again; never, never, never.\"\n \"I\u0027m not,\" said Eustace. \"I swear I\u0027m not. I swear by everything.\"\n (When I was at school one would have said, \"I swear by the Bible.\" But Bibles were not encouraged at Experiment House.)\n \"All right,\" said Jill, \"I\u0027ll believe you.\"\n \"And tell nobody?\"\n \"What do you take me for?\"\n They were very excited as they said this. But when they had said it and Jill looked round and saw the dull autumn sky and heard the drip off the leaves and thought of all the hopelessness of Experiment House (it was a thirteen-week term and there were still eleven weeks to come) she said:\n \"But after all, what\u0027s the good? We\u0027re not there: we\u0027re here. And we jolly well can\u0027t get there. Or can we?\"\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve been wondering,\" said Eustace. \"When we came back from That Place, Someone said that the two Pevensie kids (that\u0027s my two cousins) could never go there again. It was their third time, you see. I suppose they\u0027ve had their share. But he never said I couldn\u0027t. Surely he would have said so, unless he meant that I was to get back? And I can\u0027t help wondering, can we - could we -?\"\n \"Do you mean, do something to make it happen?\"\n Eustace nodded.\n \"You mean we might draw a circle on the ground - and write in queer letters in it - and stand inside it - and recite charms and spells?\"\n \"Well,\" said Eustace after he had thought hard for a bit. \"I believe that was the sort of thing I was thinking of, though I never did it. But now that it comes to the point, I\u0027ve an idea that all those circles and things are rather rot. I don\u0027t think he\u0027d like them. It would look as if we thought we could make him do things. But really, we can only ask him.\"\n \"Who is this person you keep on talking about?\"\n \"They call him Aslan in That Place,\" said Eustace.\n \"What a curious name!\"\n \"Not half so curious as himself,\" said Eustace solemnly. \"But let\u0027s get on. It can\u0027t do any harm, just asking. Let\u0027s stand side by side, like this. And we\u0027ll hold out our arms in front of us with the palms down: like they did in Ramandu\u0027s island -\"\n \"Whose island?\"\n \"I\u0027ll tell you about that another time. And he might like us to face the east. Let\u0027s see, where is the east?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Jill.\n \"It\u0027s an extraordinary thing about girls that they never know the points of the compass,\" said Eustace.\n \"You don\u0027t know either,\" said Jill indignantly.\n \"Yes I do, if only you didn\u0027t keep on interrupting. I\u0027ve got it now. That\u0027s the east, facing up into the laurels. Now, will you say the words after me?\u0027\u0027\n \"What words?\" asked Jill.\n \"The words I\u0027m going to say, of course,\" answered Eustace. \"Now -\"\n And he began, \"Aslan, Aslan, Aslan!\"\n \"Aslan, Aslan, Aslan,\" repeated Jill.\n \"Please let us two go into -\"\n At that moment a voice from the other side of the gym was heard shouting out, \"Pole? Yes. I know where she is. She\u0027s blubbing behind the gym. Shall I fetch her out?\"\n Jill and Eustace gave one glance at each other, dived under the laurels, and began scrambling up the steep, earthy slope of the shrubbery at a speed which did them great credit. (Owing to the curious methods of teaching at Experiment House, one did not learn much French or Maths or Latin or things of that sort; but one did learn a lot about getting away quickly and quietly when They were looking for one.)\n After about a minute\u0027s scramble they stopped to listen, and knew by the noises they heard that they were being followed.\n \"If only the door was open again!\" said Scrubb as they went on, and Jill nodded. For at the top of the shrubbery was a high stone wall and in that wall a door by which you could get out on to open moor. This door was nearly always locked. But there had been times when people had found it open; or perhaps there had been only one time. But you may imagine how the memory of even one time kept people hoping, and trying the door; for if it should happen to be unlocked it would be a splendid way of getting outside the school grounds without being seen.\n Jill and Eustace, now both very hot and very grubby from going along bent almost double under the laurels, panted up to the wall. And there was the door, shut as usual.\n \"It\u0027s sure to be no good,\" said Eustace with his hand on the handle; and then, \"O-o-oh. By Gum!!\" For the handle turned and the door opened.\n A moment before, both of them had meant to get through that doorway in double quick time, if by any chance the door was not locked. But when the door actually opened, they both stood stock still. For what they saw was quite different from what they had expected.\n They had expected to see the grey, heathery slope of the moor going up and up to join the dull autumn sky. Instead, a blaze of sunshine met them. It poured through the doorway as the light of a June day pours into a garage when you open the door. It made the drops of water on the grass glitter like beads and showed up the dirtiness of Jill\u0027s tear-stained face. And the sunlight was coming from what certainly did look like a different world - what they could see of it. They saw smooth turf, smoother and brighter than Jill had ever seen before, and blue sky, and, darting to and fro, things so bright that they might have been jewels or huge butterflies.\n Although she had been longing for something like this, Jill felt frightened. She looked at Scrubb\u0027s face and saw that he was frightened too.\n \"Come on, Pole,\" he said in a breathless voice.\n \"Can we get back? Is it safe?\" asked Jill.\n At that moment a voice shouted from behind, a mean, spiteful little voice. \"Now then, Pole,\" it squeaked. \"Everyone knows you\u0027re there. Down you come.\" It was the voice of Edith Jackle, not one of Them herself but one of their hangers-on and tale-bearers.\n \"Quick!\" said Scrubb. \"Here. Hold hands. We mustn\u0027t get separated.\" And before she quite knew what was happening, he had grabbed her hand and pulled her through the door, out of the school grounds, out of England, out of our whole world into That Place.\n The sound of Edith Jackle\u0027s voice stopped as suddenly as the voice on the radio when it is switched off. Instantly there was a quite different sound all about them. It came from those bright things overhead, which now turned out to be birds. They were making a riotous noise, but it was much more like music - rather advanced music which you don\u0027t quite take in at the first hearing - than birds\u0027 songs ever are in our world. Yet, in spite of the singing, there was a sort of background of immense silence. That silence, combined with the freshness of the air, made Jill think they must be on the top of a very high mountain.\n Scrubb still had her by the hand and they were walking forward, staring about them on every side. Jill saw that huge trees, rather like cedars but bigger, grew in every direction. But as they did not grow close together, and as there was no undergrowth, this did not prevent one from seeing a long way into the forest to left and right. And as far as Jill\u0027s eye could reach, it was all the same - level turf, darting birds with yellow, or dragonfly blue, or rainbow plumage, blue shadows, and emptiness. There was not a breath of wind in that cool, bright air. It was a very lonely forest.\n Right ahead there were no trees: only blue sky. They went straight on without speaking till suddenly Jill heard Scrubb say, \"Look out!\" and felt herself jerked back. They were at the very edge of a cliff.\n Jill was one of those lucky people who have a good head for heights. She didn\u0027t mind in the least standing on the edge of a precipice. She was rather annoyed with Scrubb for pulling her back - \"just as if I was a kid\", she said and she wrenched her hand out of his. When she saw how very white he had turned, she despised him.\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" she said. And to show that she was not afraid, she stood very near the edge indeed; in fact, a good deal nearer than even she liked. Then she looked down.\n She now realized that Scrubb had some excuse for looking white, for no cliff in our world is to be compared with this. Imagine yourself at the top of the very highest cliff you know. And imagine yourself looking down to the very bottom. And then imagine that the precipice goes on below that, as far again, ten times as far, twenty times as far. And when you\u0027ve looked down all that distance imagine little white things that might, at first glance, be mistaken for sheep, but presently you realize that they are clouds - not little wreaths of mist but the enormous white, puffy clouds which are themselves as big as most mountains. And at last, in between those clouds, you get your first glimpse of the real bottom, so far away that you can\u0027t make out whether it\u0027s field or wood, or land or water: farther below those clouds than you are above them.\n Jill stared at it. Then she thought that perhaps, after all, she would step back afoot or so from the edge; but she didn\u0027t like to for fear of what Scrubb would think. Then she suddenly decided that she didn\u0027t care what he thought, and that she would jolly well get away from that horrible edge and never laugh at anyone for not liking heights again. But when she tried to move, she found she couldn\u0027t. Her legs seemed to have turned into putty. Everything was swimming before her eyes.\n \"What are you doing, Pole? Come back-blithering little idiot!\" shouted Scrubb. But his voice seemed to he coming from a long way off. She felt him grabbing at her. But by now she had no control over her own arms and legs. There was a moment\u0027s struggling on the cliff edge. Jill was too frightened and dizzy to know quite what she was doing, but two things she remembered as long as she lived (they often came back to her in dreams). One was that she had wrenched herself free of Scrubb\u0027s clutches; the other was that, at the same moment, Scrubb himself, with a terrified scream, had lost his balance and gone hurtling to the depths.\n Fortunately, she was given no time to think over what she had done. Some huge, brightly coloured animal had rushed to the edge of the cliff. It was lying down, leaning over, and (this was the odd thing) blowing. Not roaring or snorting, but just blowing from its wide-opened mouth; blowing out as steadily as a vacuum cleaner sucks in. Jill was lying so close to the creature that she could feel the breath vibrating steadily through its body. She was lying still because she couldn\u0027t get up. She was nearly fainting: indeed, she wished she could really faint, but faints don\u0027t come for the asking. At last she saw, far away below her, a tiny black speck floating away from the cliff and slightly upwards. As it rose, it also got farther away. By the time it was nearly on a level with the cliff-top it was so far off that she lost sight of it. It was obviously moving away from them at a great speed. Jill couldn\u0027t help thinking that the creature at her side was blowing it away.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/113/5662.html","bookId":450,"book":{"id":450,"title":"纳尼亚传奇：银椅 The Silver Chair","description":"简介： First editionMain article: The Silver ChairCompleted in the beginning of March 1951[9] and published 7 September 1953, The Silver Chair is the first Narnia book without the Pevensie children.
