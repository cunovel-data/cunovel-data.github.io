{"id":14860,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"THE HOUSE OF HARFANG \"Go on, Pole, do your stuff,\" whispered Scrubb. Jill found that her mouth was so dry that she couldn\u0027t speak a word. She nodded savagely at Scrubb. Thinking to himself that he would never forgive her (or Puddleglum either), Scrubb licked his lips and shouted up to the King giant. \"If you please, Sire, the Lady of the Green Kirtle salutes you by us and said you\u0027d like to have us for your Autumn Feast.\" The giant King and Queen looked at each other, nodded to each other, and smiled in a way that Jill didn\u0027t exactly like. She liked the King better than the Queen. He had a fine, curled beard and a straight eagle-like nose, and was really rather good-looking as giants go. The Queen was dreadfully fat and had a double chin and a fat, powdered face - which isn\u0027t a very nice thing at the best of times, and of course looks much worse when it is ten times too big. Then the King put out his tongue and licked his lips. Anyone might do that: but his tongue was so very large and red, and came out so unexpectedly, that it gave Jill quite a shock. \"Oh, what good children!\" said the Queen. (\"Perhaps she\u0027s the nice one after all,\" thought Jill.) \"Yes indeed,\" said the King. \"Quite excellent children. We welcome you to our court. Give me your hands.\" He stretched down his great right hand - very clean and with any number of rings on the fingers, but also with terrible pointed nails. He was much too big to shake the hands which the children, in turn, held up to him; but he shook the arms. \"And what\u0027s that?\" asked the King, pointing to Puddleglum. \"Reshpeckobiggle,\" said Puddleglum. \"Oh!\" screamed the Queen, gathering her skirts close about her ankles. \"The horrid thing! It\u0027s alive.\" \"He\u0027s quite all right, your Majesty, really, he is,\" said Scrubb hastily. \"You\u0027ll like him much better when you get to know him. I\u0027m sure you will.\" I hope you won\u0027t lose all interest in Jill for the rest of the book if I tell you that at this moment she began to cry. There was a good deal of excuse for her. Her feet and hands and ears and nose were still only just beginning to thaw; melted snow was trickling off her clothes; she had had hardly anything to eat or drink that day; and her legs were aching so that she felt she could not go on standing much longer. Anyway, it did more good at the moment than anything else would have done, for the Queen said: \"Ah, the poor child! My lord, we do wrong to keep our guests standing. Quick, some of you! Take them away. Give them food and wine and baths. Comfort the little girl. Give her lollipops, give her dolls, give her physics, give her all you can think of - possets and comfits and caraways and lullabies and toys. Don\u0027t cry, little girl, or you won\u0027t be good for anything when the feast comes.\" Jill was just as indignant as you and I would have been at the mention of toys and dolls; and, though lollipops and comfits might be all very well in their way, she very much hoped that something more solid would be provided. The Queen\u0027s foolish speech, however, produced excellent results, for Puddleglum and Scrubb were at once picked up by gigantic gentlemen-in-waiting, and Jill by a gigantic maid of honour, and carried off to their rooms. Jill\u0027s room was about the size of a church, and would have been rather grim if it had not had a roaring fire on the hearth and a very thick crimson carpet on the floor. And here delightful things began to happen to her. She was handed over to the Queen\u0027s old Nurse, who was, from the giants\u0027 point of view, a little old woman almost bent double with age, and, from the human point of view, a giantess small enough to go about an ordinary room without knocking her head on the ceiling. She was very capable, though Jill did wish she wouldn\u0027t keep on clicking her tongue and saying things like \"Oh la, la! Ups-adaisy\" and \"There\u0027s a duck\" and \"Now we\u0027ll be all right, my poppet\". She filled a giant foot-bath with hot water and helped Jill into it. If you can swim (as Jill could) a giant bath is a lovely thing. And giant towels, though a bit rough and coarse, are lovely too, because there are acres of them. In fact you don\u0027t need to dry at all, you just roll about on them in front of the fire and enjoy yourself. And when that was over, clean, fresh, warmed clothes were put on Jill: very splendid clothes and a little too big for her, but clearly made for humans not giantesses. \"I suppose if that woman in the green kirtle comes here, they must be used to guests of our size,\" thought Jill. She soon saw that she was right about this, for a table and chair of the right height for an ordinary grown-up human were placed for her, and the knives and forks and spoons were the proper size too. It was delightful to sit down, feeling warm and clean at last. Her feet were still bare and it was lovely to tread on the giant carpet. She sank in it well over her ankles and it was just the thing for sore feet. The meal - which I suppose we must call dinner, though it was nearer tea time - was cock-a-leekie soup, and hot roast turkey, and a steamed pudding, and roast chestnuts, and as much fruit as you could eat. The only annoying thing was that the Nurse kept coming in and out, and every time she came in, she brought a gigantic toy with her - a huge doll, bigger than Jill herself, a wooden horse on wheels, about the size of an elephant, a drum that looked like a young gasometer, and a woolly lamb. They were crude, badly made things, painted in very bright colours, and Jill hated the sight of them. She kept on telling the Nurse she didn\u0027t want them, but the Nurse said: \"Tut-tut-tut-tut. You\u0027ll want \u0027em all right when you\u0027ve had a bit of a rest, I know! Te-he-he! Beddy bye, now. A precious poppet!\" The bed was not a giant bed but only a big four-poster, like what you might see in an old-fashioned hotel; and very small it looked in that enormous room. She was very glad to tumble into it. \"Is it still snowing, Nurse?\" she asked sleepily. \"No. Raining now, ducky!\" said the giantess. \"Rain\u0027ll wash away all the nasty snow. Precious poppet will be able to go out and play tomorrow!\" And she tucked Jill up and said good night. I know nothing so disagreeable as being kissed by a giantess. Jill thought the same, but was asleep in five minutes. The rain fell steadily all the evening and all the night, dashing against the windows of the castle, and Jill never heard it but slept deeply, past supper time and past midnight. And then came the deadest hour of the night and nothing stirred but mice in the house of the giants. At that hour there came to Jill a dream. It seemed to her that she awoke in the same room and saw the fire, sunk low and red, and in the firelight the great wooden horse. And the horse came of its own will, rolling on its wheels across the carpet, and stood at her head. And now it was no longer a horse, but a lion as big as the horse. And then it was not a toy lion, but a real lion, The Real Lion, just as she had seen him on the mountain beyond the world\u0027s end. And a smell of all sweet-smelling things there are filled the room. But there was some trouble in Jill\u0027s mind, though she could not think what it was, and the tears streamed down her face and wet the pillow. The Lion told her to repeat the signs, and she found that she had forgotten them all. At that, a great horror came over her. And Aslan took her up in his jaws (she could feel his lips and his breath but not his teeth) and carried her to the window and made her look out. The moon shone bright; and written in great letters across the world or the sky (she did not know which) were the words UNDER ME. After that, the dream faded away, and when she woke, very late next morning, she did not remember that she had dreamed at all. She was up and dressed and had finished breakfast in front of the fire when the Nurse opened the door and said: \"Here\u0027s pretty poppet\u0027s little friends come to play with her.\" In came Scrubb and the Marsh-wiggle. \"Hullo! Good morning,\" said Jill. \"Isn\u0027t this fun? I\u0027ve slept about fifteen hours, I believe. I do feel better, don\u0027t you?\" \"1 do,\" said Scrubb, \"but Puddleglum says he has a headache. Hullo! - your window has a window seat. If we got up on that, we could see out.\" And at once they all did so: and at the first glance Jill said, \"Oh, how perfectly dreadful!\" The sun was shining and, except for a few drifts, the snow had been almost completely washed away by the rain. Down below them, spread out like a map, lay the flat hill-top which they had struggled over yesterday afternoon; seen from the castle, it could not be mistaken for anything but the ruins of a gigantic city. It had been flat, as Jill now saw, because it was still, on the whole, paved, though in places the pavement was broken. The criss-cross banks were what was left of the walls of huge buildings which might once have been giants\u0027 palaces and temples. One bit of wall, about five hundred feet high, was still standing; it was that which she had thought was a cliff. The things that had looked like factory chimneys were enormous pillars, broken off at unequal heights; their fragments lay at their bases like felled trees of monstrous stone. The ledges which they had climbed down on the north side of the hill - and also, no doubt the other ledges which they had climbed up on the south side - were the remaining steps of giant stairs. To crown all, in large, dark lettering across the centre of the pavement, ran the words UNDER ME. The three travellers looked at each other in dismay, and, after a short whistle, Scrubb said what they were all thinking, \"The second and third signs muffed.\" And at that moment Jill\u0027s dream rushed back into her mind. \"It\u0027s my fault,\" she said in despairing tones. \"I - I\u0027d given up repeating the signs every night. If I\u0027d been thinking about them I could have seen it was the city, even in all that snow.\" \"I\u0027m worse,\" said Puddleglum. \"I did see, or nearly. I thought it looked uncommonly like a ruined city.\" \"You\u0027re the only one who isn\u0027t to blame,\" said Scrubb. \"You did try to make us stop.\" \"Didn\u0027t try hard enough, though,\" said the Marshwiggle. \"And I\u0027d no call to be trying. I ought to have done it. As if I couldn\u0027t have stopped you two with one hand each!\" \"The truth is,\" said Scrubb, \"we were so jolly keen on getting to this place that we weren\u0027t bothering about anything else. At least I know I was. Ever since we met that woman with the knight who didn\u0027t talk, we\u0027ve been thinking of nothing else. We\u0027d nearly forgotten about Prince Rilian.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t wonder,\" said Puddleglum, \"if that wasn\u0027t exactly what she intended.\" \"What I don\u0027t quite understand,\" said Jill, \"is how we didn\u0027t see the lettering? Or could it have come there since last night. Could he - Aslan - have put it there in the night? I had such a queer dream.\" And she told them all about it. \"Why, you chump!\" said Scrubb. \"We did see it. We got into the lettering. Don\u0027t you see? We got into the letter E in ME. That was your sunk lane. We walked along the bottom stroke of the E, due north - turned to our right along the upright - came to another turn to the right - that\u0027s the middle stroke - and then went on to the top left-hand corner, or (if you like) the north-eastern corner of the letter, and came back. Like the bally idiots we are.\" He kicked the window seat savagely, and went on, \"So it\u0027s no good, Pole. I know what you were thinking because I was thinking the same. You were thinking how nice it would have been if Aslan hadn\u0027t put the instructions on the stones of the ruined city till after we\u0027d passed it. And then it would have been his fault, not ours. So likely, isn\u0027t it? No. We must just own up. We\u0027ve only four signs to go by, and we\u0027ve muffed the first three.\" \"You mean I have,\" said Jill. \"It\u0027s quite true. I\u0027ve spoiled everything ever since you brought me here. All the same - I\u0027m frightfully sorry and all that - all the same, what are the instructions? UNDER ME doesn\u0027t seem to make much sense.\" \"Yes it does, though,\" said Puddleglum. \"It means we\u0027ve got to look for the Prince under that city.\" \"But how can we?\" asked Jill. \"That\u0027s the question,\" said Puddleglum, rubbing his big, frog-like hands together. \"How can we now? No doubt, if we\u0027d had our minds on our job when we were at the Ruinous City, we\u0027d have been shown how - found a little door, or a cave, or a tunnel, met someone to help us. Might have been (you never know) Aslan himself. We\u0027d have got down under those paving-stones somehow or other. Aslan\u0027s instructions always work: there are no exceptions. But how to do it now - that\u0027s another matter.\" \"Well, we shall just have to go back, I suppose,\" said Jill. \"Easy, isn\u0027t it?\" said Puddleglum. \"We might try opening that door to begin with.\" And they all looked at the door and saw that none of them could reach the handle, and that almost certainly no one could turn it if they did. \"Do you think they won\u0027t let us out if we ask?\" said Jill. And nobody said, but everyone thought, \"Supposing they don\u0027t.\" It was not a pleasant idea. Puddleglum was dead against any idea of telling the giants their real business and simply asking to be let out; and of course the children couldn\u0027t tell without his permission, because they had promised. And all three felt pretty sure that there would be no chance of escaping from the castle by night. Once they were in their rooms with the doors shut, they would be prisoners till morning. They might, of course, ask to have their doors left open, but that would rouse suspicions. \"Our only chance,\" said Scrubb, \"is to try to sneak away by daylight. Mightn\u0027t there be an hour in the afternoon when most of the giants are asleep? - and if we could steal down into the kitchen, mightn\u0027t there be a back door open?\" \"It\u0027s hardly what I call a Chance,\" said the Marshwiggle. \"But it\u0027s all the chance we\u0027re likely to get.\" As a matter of fact, Scrubb\u0027s plan was not quite so hopeless as you might think. If you want to get out of a house without being seen, the middle of the afternoon is in some ways a better time to try it than the middle of the night. Doors and windows are more likely to be open; and if you are caught, you can always pretend you weren\u0027t meaning to go far and had no particular plans. (It is very hard to make either giants or grown-ups believe this if you\u0027re found climbing out of a bedroom window at one o\u0027clock in the morning.) \"We must put them off their guard, though,\" said Scrubb. \"We must pretend we love being here and are longing for this Autumn Feast.\" \"That\u0027s tomorrow night,\" said Puddleglum. \"I heard one of them say so.\" \"I see,\" said Jill. \"We must pretend to be awfully excited about it, and keep on asking questions. They think we\u0027re absolute infants anyway, which will make it easier.\" \"Gay,\" said Puddleglum with a deep sigh. \"That\u0027s what we\u0027ve got to be. Gay. As if we hadn\u0027t a care in the world. Frolicsome. You two youngsters haven\u0027t always got very high spirits, I\u0027ve noticed. You must watch me, and do as I do. I\u0027ll be gay. Like this\" - and he assumed a ghastly grin. \"And frolicsome\" - here he cut a most mournful caper. \"You\u0027ll soon get into it, if you keep your eyes on me. They think I\u0027m a funny fellow already, you see. I dare say you two thought I was a trifle tipsy last night, but I do assure you it was - well, most of it was - put on. I had an idea it would come in useful, somehow.\" The children, when they talked over their adventures afterwards, could never feel sure whether this last statement was quite strictly true; but they were sure that Puddleglum thought it was true when he made it. \"All right. Gay\u0027s the word,\" said Scrubb. \"Now, if we could only get someone to open this door. While we\u0027re fooling about and being gay, we\u0027ve got to find out all we can about this castle.\" Luckily, at that very moment the door opened, and the giant Nurse bustled in saying, \"Now, my poppets. Like to come and see the King and all the court setting out on the hunting? Such a pretty sight!\" They lost no time in rushing out past her and climbing down the first staircase they came to. The noise of hounds and horns and giant voices guided them, so that in a few minutes they reached the courtyard. The giants were all on foot, for there are no giant horses in that part of the world, and the giants\u0027 hunting is done on foot; like beagling in England. The hounds were also of normal size. When Jill saw that there were no horses she was at first dreadfully disappointed, for she felt sure that the great fat Queen would never go after hounds on foot; and it would never do to have her about the house all day. But then she saw the Queen in a kind of litter supported on the shoulders of six young giants. The silly old creature was all got up in green and had a horn at her side. Twenty or thirty giants, including the King, were assembled, ready for the sport, all talking and laughing fit to deafen you: and down below, nearer Jill\u0027s level, there were wagging tails, and barking, and loose, slobbery mouths and noses of dogs thrust into your hand. Puddleglum was just beginning to strike what he thought a gay and gamesome attitude (which might have spoiled everything if it had been noticed) when Jill put on her most attractively childish smile, rushed across to the Queen\u0027s litter and shouted up to the Queen. \"Oh, please! You\u0027re not going away, are you? You will come back?\" \"Yes, my dear,\" said the Queen. \"I\u0027ll be back tonight.\" \"Oh, good. How lovely!\" said Jill. \"And we may come to the feast tomorrow night, mayn\u0027t we? We\u0027re so longing for tomorrow night! And we do love being here. And while you\u0027re out, we may run over the whole castle and see everything, mayn\u0027t we? Do say yes.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/113/5669.html","bookId":450,"book":{"id":450,"title":"纳尼亚传奇：银椅 The Silver Chair","description":"简介： First editionMain article: The Silver ChairCompleted in the beginning of March 1951[9] and published 7 September 1953, The Silver Chair is the first Narnia book without the Pevensie children.
