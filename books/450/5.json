{"id":14857,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"PUDDLEGLUM \"Oh, come on, Pole, buck up,\" said Scrubb\u0027s voice. \"After all, it is an adventure.\" \"I\u0027m sick of adventures,\" said Jill crossly. She did, however, consent to climb on to Glimfeather\u0027s back, and was thoroughly waked up (for a while) by the unexpected coldness of the air when he flew out with her into the night. The moon had disappeared and there were no stars. Far behind her she could see a single lighted window well above the ground; doubtless, in one of the towers of Cair Paravel. It made her long to be back in that delightful bedroom, snug in bed, watching the firelight on the walls. She put her hands under her cloak and wrapped it tightly round her. It was uncanny to hear two voices in the dark air a little distance away; Scrubb and his owl were talking to one another. \"He doesn\u0027t sound tired,\" thought Jill. She did not realize that he had been on great adventures in that world before and that the Narnian air was bringing back to him a strength he had won when he sailed the Eastern Seas with King Caspian. Jill had to pinch herself to keep awake, for she knew that if she dozed on Glimfeather\u0027s back she would probably fall off. When at last the two owls ended their flight, she climbed stiffly off Glimfeather and found herself on flat ground. A chilly wind was blowing and they appeared to be in a place without trees. \"Tu-whoo, tu-whoo!\" Glimfeather was calling. \"Wake up, Puddleglum. Wake up. It is on the Lion\u0027s business.\" For a long time there was no reply. Then, a long way off, a dim light appeared and began to come nearer. With it came a voice. \"Owls ahoy!\" it said. \"What is it? Is the King dead? Has an enemy landed in Narnia? Is it a flood? Or dragons?\" When the light reached them, it turned out to be that of a large lantern. She could see very little of the person who held it. He seemed to be all legs and arms. The owls were talking to him, explaining everything, but she was too tired to listen. She tried to wake herself up a bit when she realized that they were saying goodbye to her. But she could never afterwards remember much except that, sooner or later, she and Scrubb were stooping to enter a low doorway and then (oh, thank heavens) were lying down on something soft and warm, and a voice was saying: \"There you are. Best we can do. You\u0027ll lie cold and hard. Damp too, I shouldn\u0027t wonder. Won\u0027t sleep a wink, most likely; even if there isn\u0027t a thunderstorm or a flood or the wigwam doesn\u0027t fall down on top of us all, as I\u0027ve known them do. Must make the best of it -\" But she was fast asleep before the voice had ended. When the children woke late next morning they found that they were lying, very dry and warm, on beds of straw in a dark place. A triangular opening let in the daylight. \"Where on earth are we?\" asked Jill. \"In the wigwam of a Marsh-wiggle,\" said Eustace. \"A what?\" \"A Marsh-wiggle. Don\u0027t ask me what it is. I couldn\u0027t see it last night. I\u0027m getting up. Let\u0027s go and look for it.\" \"How beastly one feels after sleeping in one\u0027s clothes,\" said Jill, sitting up. \"I was just thinking how nice it was not to have to dress,\" said Eustace. \"Or wash either, I suppose,\" said Jill scornfully. But Scrubb had already got up, yawned, shaken himself, and crawled out of the wigwam. Jill did the same. What they found outside was quite unlike the bit of Narnia they had seen on the day before. They were on a great flat plain which was cut into countless little islands by countless channels of water. The islands were covered with coarse grass and bordered with reeds and rushes. Sometimes there were beds of rushes about an acre in extent. Clouds of birds were constantly alighting in them and rising from them again-duck, snipe, bitterns, herons. Many wigwams like that in which they had passed the night could be seen dotted about, but all at a good distance from one another; for Marsh-wiggles are people who like privacy. Except for the fringe of the forest several miles to the south and west of them, there was not a tree in sight. Eastward the flat marsh stretched to low sand-hills on the horizon, and you could tell by the salt tang in the wind which blew from that direction that the sea lay over there. To the North there were low pale-coloured hills, in places bastioned with rock. The rest was all flat marsh. It would have been a depressing place on a w et evening. Seen under a morning sun, with a fresh wind blowing, and the air filled with the crying of birds, there was something fine and fresh and clean about its loneliness. The children felt their spirits rise. \"Where has the thingummy got to, I wonder?\" said Jill. \"The Marsh-wiggle,\" said Scrubb, as if he were rather proud of knowing the word. \"I expect-hullo, that must be him.\" And then they both saw him, sitting with his back to them, fishing, about fifty yards away. He had been hard to see at first because he was nearly the same colour as the marsh and because he sat so still. \"I suppose we\u0027d better go and speak to him,\" said Jill. Scrubb nodded. They both felt a little nervous. As they drew nearer, the figure turned its head and showed them a long thin face with rather sunken cheeks, a tightly shut mouth, a sharp nose, and no beard. He was wearing a high, pointed hat like a steeple, with an enormously wide flat brim. The hair, if it could be called hair, which hung over his large ears was greeny-grey, and each lock was flat rather than round, so that they were like tiny reeds. His expression was solemn, his complexion muddy, and you could see at once that he took a serious view of life. \"Good morning, Guests,\" he said. \"Though when I say good I don\u0027t mean it won\u0027t probably turn to rain or it might he snow, or fog, or thunder. You didn\u0027t get any sleep, I dare say. \"Yes we did, though,\" said Jill. \"We had a lovely night.\" \"Ah,\" said the Marsh-wiggle, shaking his head. \"I see you\u0027re making the best of a bad job. That\u0027s right. You\u0027ve been well brought up, you have. You\u0027ve learned to put a good face on things.\" \"Please, we don\u0027t know your name,\" said Scrubb. \"Puddleglum\u0027s my name. But it doesn\u0027t matter if you forget it. I can always tell you again.\" The children sat down on each side of him. They now saw that he had very long legs and arms, so that although his body was not much bigger than a dwarf\u0027s, he would be taller than most men when he stood up. The fingers of his hands were webbed like a frog\u0027s, and so were his bare feet which dangled in the muddy water. He was dressed in earthcoloured clothes that hung loose about him. \"I\u0027m trying to catch a few eels to make an eel stew for our dinner,\" said Puddleglum. \"Though I shouldn\u0027t wonder if I didn\u0027t get any. And you won\u0027t like them much if I do.\" \"Why not?\" asked Scrubb. \"Why, it\u0027s not in reason that you should like our sort of victuals, though I\u0027ve no doubt you\u0027ll put a bold face on it. All the same, while I am a catching of them, if you two could try to light the fire - no harm trying -! The wood\u0027s behind the wigwam. It may be wet. You could light it inside the wigwam, and then we\u0027d get all the smoke in our eyes. Or you could light it outside, and then the rain would come and put it out. Here\u0027s my tinder-box. You won\u0027t know how to use it, I expect.\" But Scrubb had learned that sort of thing on his last adventure. The children ran back together to the wigwam, found the wood (which was perfectly dry) and succeeded in lighting a fire with rather less than the usual difficulty. Then Scrubb sat and took care of it while Jill went and had some sort of wash - not a very nice one - in the nearest channel. After that she saw to the fire and he had a wash. Both felt a good deal fresher, but very hungry. Presently the Marsh-wiggle joined them. In spite of his expectation of catching no eels, he had a dozen or so, which he had already skinned and cleaned. He put a big pot on, mended the fire, and lit his pipe. Marsh-wiggles smoke a very strange, heavy sort of tobacco (some people say they mix it with mud) and the children noticed the smoke from Puddleglum\u0027s pipe hardly rose in the air at all. It trickled out of the bowl and downwards and drifted along the ground like a mist. It was very black and set Scrubb coughing. \"Now,\" said Puddleglum. \"Those eels will take a mortal long time to cook, and either of you might faint with hunger before they\u0027re done. I knew a little girl - but I\u0027d better not tell you that story. It might lower your spirits, and that\u0027s a thing I never do. So, to keep your minds off your hunger, we may as well talk about our plans.\" \"Yes, do let\u0027s,\" said Jill. \"Can you help us to find Prince Rilian?\" The Marsh-wiggle sucked in his cheeks till they were hollower than you would have thought possible. \"Well, I don\u0027t know that you\u0027d call it help,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know that anyone can exactly help. It stands to reason we\u0027re not likely to get very far on a journey to the North, not at this time of the year, with the winter coming on soon and all. And an early winter too, by the look of things. But you mustn\u0027t let that make you down-hearted. Very likely, what with enemies, and mountains, and rivers to cross, and losing our way, and next to nothing to eat, and sore feet, we\u0027ll hardly notice the weather. And if we don\u0027t get far enough to do any good, we may get far enough not to get back in a hurry.\" Both children noticed that he said \"we\", not \"you\", and both exclaimed at the same moment. \"Are you coming with us?\" \"Oh yes, I\u0027m coming of course. Might as well, you see. I don\u0027t suppose we shall ever see the King back in Narnia, now that he\u0027s once set off for foreign parts; and he had a nasty cough when he left. Then there\u0027s Trumpkin. He\u0027s failing fast. And you\u0027ll find there\u0027ll have been a bad harvest after this terrible dry summer. And I shouldn\u0027t wonder if some enemy attacked us. Mark my words.\" \"And how shall we start?\" said Scrubb. \"Well,\" said the Marsh-wiggle very slowly, \"all the others who ever went looking for Prince Rilian started from that same fountain where the Lord Drinian saw the lady. They went north, mostly. And as none of them ever came back, we can\u0027t exactly say how they got on.\" \"We\u0027ve got to start by finding a ruined city of giants,\" said Jill. \"Aslan said so.\" \"Got to start by finding it, have we?\" answered Puddleglum. \"Not allowed to start by looking for it, I suppose?\" \"That\u0027s what I meant, of course,\" said Jill. \"And then, when we\u0027ve found it-\" \"Yes, when!\" said Puddleglum very drily. \"Doesn\u0027t anyone know where it is?\" asked Scrubb. \"I don\u0027t know about Anyone,\" said Puddleglum. \"And I won\u0027t say I haven\u0027t heard of that Ruined City. You wouldn\u0027t start from the fountain, though. You\u0027d have to go across Ettinsmoor. That\u0027s where the Ruined City is, if it\u0027s anywhere. But I\u0027ve been as far in that direction as most people and I never got to any ruins, so I won\u0027t deceive you.\" \"Where\u0027s Ettinsmoor?\" said Scrubb. \"Look over there northward,\" said Puddleglum, pointing with his pipe. \"See those hills and bits of cliff? That\u0027s the beginning of Ettinsmoor. But there\u0027s a river between it and us; the river Shribble. No bridges, of course.\" \"I suppose we can ford it, though,\" said Scrubb. \"Well, it has been forded,\" admitted the Marsh-wiggle. \"Perhaps we shall meet people on Ettinsmoor who can tell us the way,\" said Jill. \"You\u0027re right about meeting people,\" said Puddleglum. \"What sort of people live there?\" she asked. \"It\u0027s not for me to say they aren\u0027t all right in their own way,\" answered Puddleglum. \"If you like their way.\" \"Yes, but what are they?\" pressed Jill. \"There are so many queer creatures in this country. I mean, are they animals, or birds, or dwarfs, or what?\" The Marsh-wiggle gave a long whistle. \"Phew!\" he said. \"Don\u0027t you know? I thought the owls had told you. They\u0027re giants.\" Jill winced. She had never liked giants even in books, and she had once met one in a nightmare. Then she saw Scrubb\u0027s face, which had turned rather green, and thought to herself, \"I bet he\u0027s in a worse funk than I am.\" That made her feel braver. \"The King told me long ago,\" said Scrubb - \"that time when I was with him at sea-that he\u0027d jolly well beaten those giants in war and made them pay him tribute.\" \"That\u0027s true enough,\" said Puddleglum. \"They\u0027re at peace with us all right. As long as we stay on our own side of the Shribble, they won\u0027t do us any harm. Over on their side, on the Moor - Still, there\u0027s always a chance. If we don\u0027t get near any of them, and if none of them forget themselves, and if we\u0027re not seen, it\u0027s just possible we might get a long way.\" \"Look here!\" said Scrubb, suddenly losing his temper, as people so easily do when they have been frightened. \"I don\u0027t believe the whole thing can be half as bad as you\u0027re making out; any more than the beds in the wigwam were hard or the wood was wet. I don\u0027t think Aslan would ever have sent us if there was so little chance as all that.\" He quite expected the Marsh-wiggle to give him an angry reply, but he only said, \"That\u0027s the spirit, Scrubb. That\u0027s the way to talk. Put a good face on it. But we all need to be very careful about our tempers, seeing all the hard times we shall have to go through together. Won\u0027t do to quarrel, you know. At any rate, don\u0027t begin it too soon. I know these expeditions usually end that way: knifing one another, I shouldn\u0027t wonder, before all\u0027s done. But the longer we can keep off it-\" \"Well, if you feel it\u0027s so hopeless,\" interrupted Scrubb, \"I think you\u0027d better stay behind. Pole and I can go on alone, can\u0027t we, Pole?\" \"Shut up and don\u0027t be an ass, Scrubb,\" said Jill hastily, terrified lest the Marsh-wiggle should take him at his word. \"Don\u0027t you lose heart, Pole,\" said Puddleglum. \"I\u0027m coming, sure and certain. I\u0027m not going to lose an opportunity like this. It will do me good. They all say - I mean, the other wiggles all say-that I\u0027m too flighty; don\u0027t take life seriously enough. If they\u0027ve said it once, they\u0027ve said it a thousand times. \u0027Puddleglum,\u0027 they\u0027ve said, `you\u0027re altogether too full of bobance and bounce and high spirits. You\u0027ve got to learn that life isn\u0027t all fricasseed frogs and eel pie. You want something to sober you down a bit. We\u0027re only saying it for your own good, Puddleglum.\u0027 That\u0027s what they say. Now a job like this - a journey up north just as winter\u0027s beginning, looking for a Prince that probably isn\u0027t there, by way of a ruined city that no one has ever seen - will be just the thing. If that doesn\u0027t steady a chap, I don\u0027t know what will.\" And he rubbed his big frog-like hands together as if he were talking of going to a party or a pantomime. \"And now,\" he added, \"let\u0027s see how those eels are getting on.\" When the meal came it was delicious and the children had two large helpings each. At first the Marsh-wiggle wouldn\u0027t believe that they really liked it, and when they had eaten so much that he had to believe them, he fell back on saying that it would probably disagree with them horribly. \"What\u0027s food for wiggles may be poison for humans, I shouldn\u0027t wonder,\" he said. After the meal they had tea, in tins (as you\u0027ve seen men having it who are working on the road), and Puddleglum had a good many sips out of a square black bottle. He offered the children some of it, but they thought it very nasty. The rest of the day was spent in preparations for an early start tomorrow morning. Puddleglum, being far the biggest, said he would carry three blankets, with a large bit of bacon rolled up inside them. Jill was to carry the remains of the eels, some biscuit, and the tinder-box. Scrubb was to carry both his own cloak and Jill\u0027s when they didn\u0027t want to wear them. Scrubb (who had learned some shooting when he sailed to the East under Caspian) had Puddleglum\u0027s secondbest bow, and Puddleglum had his best one; though he said that what with winds, and damp bowstrings, and bad light, and cold fingers, it was a hundred to one against either of them hitting anything. He and Scrubb both had swords Scrubb had brought the one which had been left out for him in his room at Cair Paravel, but Jill had to be content with her knife. There would have been a quarrel about this, but as soon as they started sparring the wiggle rubbed his hands and said, \"Ah, there you are. I thought as much. That\u0027s what usually happens on adventures.\" This made them both shut up.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/113/5666.html","bookId":450,"book":{"id":450,"title":"纳尼亚传奇：银椅 The Silver Chair","description":"简介： First editionMain article: The Silver ChairCompleted in the beginning of March 1951[9] and published 7 September 1953, The Silver Chair is the first Narnia book without the Pevensie children.
