{"id":14859,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"THE HILL OF THE STRANGE TRENCHES\n At about ten o\u0027clock the first tiny snow flakes came loitering down and settled on Jill\u0027s arm. Ten minutes later they were falling quite thickly. In twenty minutes the ground was noticeably white. And by the end of half an hour a good steady snowstorm, which looked as if it meant to last all day, was driving in their faces so that they could hardly see.\n In order to understand what followed, you must keep on remembering how little they could see. As they drew near the low hill which separated them from the place where the lighted windows had appeared, they had no general view of it at all. It was a question of seeing the next few paces ahead, and, even for that, you had to screw up your eyes. Needless to say, they were not talking.\n When they reached the foot of the hill they caught a glimpse of what might be rocks on each side - squarish rocks, if you looked at them carefully, but no one did. All were more concerned with the ledge right in front of them which barred their way. It was about four feet high. The Marsh-wiggle, with his long legs, had no difficulty in jumping onto the top of it, and he then helped the others up. It was a nasty wet business for them, though not for him, because the snow now lay quite deep on the ledge. They then had a stiff climb - Jill fell once - up very rough ground for about a hundred yards, and came to a second ledge. There were four of these ledges altogether, at quite irregular intervals.\n As they struggled on to the fourth ledge, there was no mistaking the fact that they were now at the top of the flat hill. Up till now the slope had given them some shelter; here, they got the full fury of the wind. For the hill, oddly enough, was quite as flat on top as it had looked from a distance: a great level tableland which the storm tore across without resistance. In most places the snow was still hardly lying at all, for the wind kept catching it up off the ground in sheets and clouds, and hurling it in their faces. And round their feet little eddies of snow ran about as you sometimes see them doing over ice. And, indeed, in many places, the surface was almost as smooth as ice. But to make matters worse it was crossed and crisscrossed with curious banks or dykes, which sometimes divided it up into squares and oblongs. All these of course had to be climbed; they varied from two to five feet in height and were about a couple of yards thick. On the north side of each bank the snow already lay in deep drifts; and after each climb you came down into a drift and got wet.\n Fighting her way forward with hood up and head down and numb hands inside her cloak, Jill had glimpses of other odd things on that horrible tableland - things on her right that looked vaguely like factory chimneys, and, on her left, a huge cliff, straighter than any cliff ought to be. But she wasn\u0027t at all interested and didn\u0027t give them a thought. The only things she thought about were her cold hands (and nose and chin and ears) and hot baths and beds at Harfang.\n Suddenly she skidded, slid about five feet, and found herself to her horror sliding down into a dark, narrow chasm which seemed that moment to have appeared in front of her. Half a second later she had reached the bottom. She appeared to be in a kind of trench or groove, only about three feet wide. And though she was shaken by the fall, almost the first thing she noticed was the relief of being out of the wind; for the walls of the trench rose high above her. The next thing she noticed was, naturally, the anxious faces of Scrubb and Puddleglum looking down at her from the edge.\n \"Are you hurt, Pole?\" shouted Scrubb.\n \"Both legs broken, I shouldn\u0027t wonder,\" shouted Puddleglum.\n Jill stood up and explained that she was all right, but they\u0027d have to help her out.\n \"What is it you\u0027ve fallen into?\" asked Scrubb.\n \"It\u0027s a kind of trench, or it might be a kind of sunken lane or something,\" said Jill. \"It runs quite straight.\"\n \"Yes, by Jove,\" said Scrubb. \"And it runs due north! I wonder is it a sort of road? If it was, we\u0027d be out of this infernal wind down there. Is there a lot of snow at the bottom?\"\n \"Hardly any. It all blows over the top, I suppose.\"\n \"What happens farther on?\"\n \"Half a sec. I\u0027ll go and see,\" said Jill. She got up and walked along the trench; but before she had gone far, it turned sharply to the right. She shouted this information back to the others.\n \"What\u0027s round the corner?\" asked Scrubb.\n Now it happened that Jill had the same feeling about twisty passages and dark places underground, or even nearly underground, that Scrubb had about the edges of cliffs. She had no intention of going round that corner alone; especially when she heard Puddleglum bawling out from behind her:\n \"Be careful, Pole. It\u0027s just the sort of place that might lead to a dragon\u0027s cave. And in a giant country, there might be giant earth-worms or giant beetles.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think it goes anywhere much,\" said Jill, coming hastily back.\n \"I\u0027m jolly well going to have a look,\" said Scrubb. \"What do you mean by anywhere much, I should like to know?\" So he sat down on the edge of the trench (everyone was too wet by now to bother about being a bit wetter) and then dropped in. He pushed past Jill and, though he didn\u0027t say anything, she felt sure that he knew she had funked it. So she followed him close, but took care not to get in front of him.\n It proved, however, a disappointing exploration. They went round the right-hand turn and straight on for a few paces. Here there was a choice of ways: straight on again, or sharp to the right. \"That\u0027s no good,\" said Scrubb, glancing down the right-hand turn, \"that would be taking us back - south.\" He went straight on, but once more, in a few steps, they found a second turn to the right. But this time there was no choice of ways, for the trench they had been following here came to a dead end.\n \"No good,\" grunted Scrubb. Jill lost no time in turning and leading the way back. When they returned to the place where Jill had first fallen in, the Marsh-wiggle with his long arms had no difficulty in pulling them out.\n But it was dreadful to be out on top again. Down in those narrow slits of trenches, their ears had almost begun to thaw. They had been able to see clearly and breathe easily and hear each other speak without shouting. It was absolute misery to come back into the withering coldness. And it did seem hard when Puddleglum chose that moment for saying:\n \"Are you still sure of those signs, Pole? What\u0027s the one we ought to be after, now?\"\n \"Oh, come on! Bother the signs,\" said Pole. \"Something about someone mentioning Aslan\u0027s name, I think. But I\u0027m jolly well not going to give a recitation here.\"\n As you see, she had got the order wrong. That was because she had given up saying the signs over every night. She still really knew them, if she troubled to think: but she was no longer so \"pat\" in her lesson as to be sure of reeling them off in the right order at a moment\u0027s notice and without thinking. Puddleglum\u0027s question annoyed her because, deep down inside her, she was already annoyed with herself for not knowing the Lion\u0027s lesson quite so well as she felt she ought to have known it. This annoyance, added to the misery of being very cold and tired, made her say, \"Bother the signs.\" She didn\u0027t perhaps quite mean it.\n \"Oh, that was next, was it?\" said Puddleglum. \"Now I wonder, are you right? Got \u0027em mixed, I shouldn\u0027t wonder. It seems to me, this hill, this flat place we\u0027re on, is worth stopping to have a look at. Have you noticed -\"\n \"Oh Lor!\" said Scrubb, \"is this a time for stopping to admire the view? For goodness\u0027 sake let\u0027s get on.\"\n \"Oh, look, look, look,\" cried Jill and pointed. Everyone turned, and everyone saw. Some way off to the north, and a good deal higher up than the tableland on which they stood, a line of lights had appeared. This time, even more obviously than when the travellers had seen them the night before, they were windows: smaller windows that made one think deliciously of bedrooms, and larger windows that made one think of great halls with fires roaring on the hearth and hot soup or juicy sirloins smoking on the table.\n \"Harfang!\" exclaimed Scrubb.\n \"That\u0027s all very well,\" said Puddleglum. \"But what I was saying was -\"\n \"Oh, shut up,\" said Jill crossly. \"We haven\u0027t a moment to lose. Don\u0027t you remember what the Lady said about their locking up so early? We must get there in time, we must, we must. We\u0027ll die if we\u0027re shut out on a night like this.\"\n \"Well, it isn\u0027t exactly a night, not yet,\" began Puddleglum; but the two children both said, \"Come on,\" and began stumbling forward on the slippery tableland as quickly as their legs would carry them. The Marsh-wiggle followed them: still talking, but now that they were forcing their way into the wind again, they could not have heard him even if they had wanted to. And they didn\u0027t want. They were thinking of baths and beds and hot drinks; and the idea of coming to Harfang too late and being shut out was almost unbearable.\n In spite of their haste, it took them a long time to cross the flat top of that hill. And even when they had crossed it, there were still several ledges to climb down on the far side. But at last they reached the bottom and could see what Harfang was like.\n It stood on a high crag, and in spite of its many towers was more a huge house than a castle. Obviously, the Gentle Giants feared no attack. There were windows in the outside wall quite close to the ground - a thing no one would have in a serious fortress. There were even odd little doors here and there, so that it would be quite easy to get in and out of the castle without going through the courtyard. This raised the spirits of Jill and Scrubb. It made the whole place look more friendly and less forbidding.\n At first the height and steepness of the crag frightened them, but presently they noticed that there was an easier way up on the left and that the road wound up towards it. It was a terrible climb, after the journey they had already had, and Jill nearly gave up. Scrubb and Puddleglum had to help her for the last hundred yards.\n But in the end they stood before the castle gate. The portcullis was up and the gate open.\n However tired you are, it takes some nerve to walk up to a giant\u0027s front door. In spite of all his previous warnings against Harfang, it was Puddleglum who showed most courage.\n \"Steady pace, now,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t look frightened, whatever you do. We\u0027ve done the silliest thing in the world by coming at all: but now that we are here, we\u0027d best put a bold face on it.\"\n With these words he strode forward into the gateway, stood still under the arch where the echo would help his voice, and called out as loud as he could.\n \"Ho! Porter! Guests who seek lodging.\"\n And while he was waiting for something to happen, he took off his hat and knocked off the heavy mass of snow which had gathered on its wide brim.\n \"I say,\" whispered Scrubb to Jill. \"He may be a wet blanket, but he has plenty of pluck - and cheek.\"\n A door opened, letting out a delicious glow of firelight, and the Porter appeared. Jill bit her lips for fear she should scream. He was not a perfectly enormous giant; that is to say, he was rather taller than an apple tree but nothing like so tall as a telegraph pole. He had bristly red hair, a leather jerkin with metal plates fastened all over it so as to make a kind of mail shirt, bare knees (very hairy indeed) and things like puttees on his legs. He stooped down and goggled at Puddleglum.\n \"And what sort of creature do you call yourself,\" he said.\n Jill took her courage in both hands. \"Please,\" she said, shouting up at the giant. \"The Lady of the Green Kirtle salutes the King of the Gentle Giants, and has sent us two Southern children and this Marsh-wiggle (his name\u0027s Puddleglum) to your Autumn Feast. - If it\u0027s quite convenient, of course,\" she added.\n \"Oho!\" said the Porter. \"That\u0027s quite a different story. Come in, little people, come in. You\u0027d best come into the lodge while I\u0027m sending word to his Majesty.\" He looked at the children with curiosity. \"Blue faces,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t know they. were that colour. Don\u0027t care about it myself. But I dare say you look quite nice to one another. Beetles fancy other beetles, they do say.\"\n \"Our faces are only blue with cold,\" said Jill. \"We\u0027re not this colour really.\"\n \"Then come in and get warm. Come in, little shrimps,\" said the Porter. They followed him into the lodge. And though it was rather terrible to hear such a big door clang shut behind them, they forgot about it as soon as they saw the thing they had been longing for ever since supper time last night - afire. And such a fire! It looked as if four or five whole trees were blazing on it, and it was so hot they couldn\u0027t go within yards of it. But they all flopped down on the brick floor, as near as they could bear the heat, and heaved great sighs of relief.\n \"Now, youngster,\" said the Porter to another giant who had been sitting in the back of the room, staring at the visitors till it looked as if his eyes would start out of his head, \"run across with this message to the House.\" And he repeated what Jill had said to him. The younger giant, after a final stare, and a great guffaw, left the room.\n The salt-cellar was not very like one of ours, being narrower and more upright, and made quite a good cup for Puddleglum, when the giant set it down on the floor beside him. The children expected Puddleglum to refuse it, distrusting the Gentle Giants as he did. But he muttered, \"It\u0027s rather late to be thinking of precautions now that we\u0027re inside and the door shut behind us.\" Then he sniffed at the liquor. \"Smells all right,\" he said. \"But that\u0027s nothing to go by. Better make sure,\" and took a sip. \"Tastes all right, too,\" he said. \"But it might do that at the first sip. How does it go on?\" He took a larger sip. \"Ah!\" he said. \"But is it the same all the way down?\" and took another. \"There\u0027ll be something nasty at the bottom, I shouldn\u0027t wonder,\" he said, and finished the drink. He licked his lips and remarked to the children, \"This\u0027ll be a test, you see. If I curl up, or burst, or turn into a lizard, or something, then you\u0027ll know not to take anything they offer you.\" But the giant, who was too far up to hear the things Puddleglum had been saying under his breath, roared with laughter and said, \"Why, Froggy, you\u0027re a man. See him put it away!\"\n \"Not a man . . . Marsh-wiggle,\" replied Puddleglum in a somewhat indistinct voice. \"Not frog either: Marshwiggle.\"\n At that moment the door opened behind them and the younger giant came in saying, \"They\u0027re to go to the throne-room at once.\"\n The children stood up but Puddleglum remained sitting and said, \"Marsh-wiggle. Marsh-wiggle. Very respectable Marsh-wiggle. Respectowiggle.\"\n \"Show them the way, young \u0027un,\" said the giant Porter. \"You\u0027d better carry Froggy. He\u0027s had a drop more than\u0027s good for him.\"\n \"Nothing wrong with me,\" said Puddleglum. \"Not a frog. Nothing frog with me. I\u0027m a respectabiggle.\"\n But the young giant caught him up by the waist and signed to the children to follow. In this undignified way they crossed the courtyard. Puddleglum, held in the giant\u0027s fist, and vaguely kicking the air, did certainly look very like a frog. But they had little time to notice this, for they soon entered the great doorway of the main castle - both their hearts beating faster than usual - and, after pattering along several corridors at a trot to keep up with the giant\u0027s paces, found themselves blinking in the light of an enormous room, where lamps glowed and a fire roared on the hearth and both were reflected from the gilding of roof and cornice. More giants than they could count stood on their left and right, all in magnificent robes; and on two thrones at the far end, sat two huge shapes that appeared to be the King and Queen.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/113/5668.html","bookId":450,"book":{"id":450,"title":"纳尼亚传奇：银椅 The Silver Chair","description":"简介： First editionMain article: The Silver ChairCompleted in the beginning of March 1951[9] and published 7 September 1953, The Silver Chair is the first Narnia book without the Pevensie children.
