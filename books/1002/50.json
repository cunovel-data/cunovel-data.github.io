{"id":9883,"no":50,"title":"Chapter 50.","content":"For Laila, life in Murree is one of comfort and tranquillity. \n The work is not cumbersome, and, on their days off, she andTariq take the children to ride the chairlift to Patriata hill, orgo to Pindi Point, where, on a clear day, you can see as faras Islamabad and downtown Rawalpindi. There, they spread ablanket on the grass and eat meatball sandwiches withcucumbers and drink cold ginger ale. \n It is a good life, Laila tells herself, a life to be thankful for. Itis, in fact, precisely the sort of life she used to dream forherself in her darkest days with Rasheed. Every day, Lailareminds herself of this. \n Then one warm night in July 2002, she and Tariq are lyingin bed talking in hushed voices about all the changes backhome. There have been so many. The coalition forces havedriven the Taliban out of every major city, pushed them acrossthe border to Pakistan and to the mountains in the south andeast of Afghanistan. ISAF, an international peacekeeping force,has been sent to Kabul. The country has an interim presidentnow, Hamid Karzai. \n Laila decides that now is the time to tell Tariq. \n A year ago, she would have gladly given an arm to get out ofKabul. But in the last few months, she has found herselfmissing the city of her childhood. She misses the bustle of ShorBazaar, the Gardens of Babur, the call of the water carrierslugging their goatskin bags. She misses the garment hagglers atChicken Street and the melon hawkers in Karteh-Parwan. \n But it isn\u0027t mere homesickness or nostalgia that has Lailathinking of Kabul so much these days. She has becomeplagued by restlessness. She hears of schools built in Kabul,roads repaved, women returning to work, and her life here,pleasant as it is, grateful as she is for it, seems… insufficient toher. Inconsequential Worse yet, wasteful. Of late, she hasstarted hearing Babi\u0027s voice in her head.You can be anythingyou want, Laila, he says.I know this about you. And Ialsoknow that when this war is over, Afghanistan is going to needyou. \n Laila hears Mammy\u0027s voice too. She remembers Mammy\u0027sresponse to Babi when he would suggest that they leaveAfghanistan.Iwant to see my sons\u0027 dream come true. I want tobe there when it happens, when Afghanistan is free, so theboys see it too. They\u0027ll see it through my eyes. There is a partof Laila now that wants to return to Kabul, for Mammy andBabi, for them to see it throughher eyes. \n And then, most compellingly for Laila, there is Mariam. DidMariam die for this? Laila asks herself. Did she sacrifice herselfso she, Laila, could be a maid in a foreign land? Maybe itwouldn\u0027t matter to Mariam what Laila did as long as she andthe children were safe and happy. But it matters to Laila. \n Suddenly, it matters very much. \n \"I want to go back,\" she says. \n Tariq sits up in bed and looks down at her. \n Laila is struck again by how beautiful he is, the perfect curveof his forehead, the slender muscles of his arms, his brooding,intelligent eyes. A year has passed, and still there are times, atmoments like this, when Laila cannot believe that they havefound each other again, that he is really here, with her, that heis her husband. \n \"Back? To Kabul?\" he asks. \n \"Onlyif you want it too.\"\"Are you unhappy here? You seem happy. The children too.\"Laila sits up. Tariq shifts on the bed, makes room for her. \n \"Iam happy,\" Laila says. \"Of course I am. But…where do wego from here, Tariq? How long do we stay? This isn\u0027t home. \n Kabul is, and back there so much is happening, a lot of itgood. I want to be a part of it all. I want todo something. Iwant to contribute. Do you understand?\"Tariq nods slowly. \"This is what you want, then? You\u0027resure?\"\"I want it, yes, I\u0027m sure. But it\u0027s more than that. I feel likeIhave to go back. Staying here, it doesn\u0027t feel right anymore.\"Tariq looks at his hands, then back up at her. \n \"But only-only-if you want to go too.\"Tariq smiles. The furrows from his brow clear, and for a briefmoment he is the old Tariq again, the Tariq who did not getheadaches, who had once said that in Siberia snot turned toice before it hit the ground. It may be her imagination, butLaila believes there are more frequent sightings of this old Tariqthese clays. \n \"Me?\" he says. \"I\u0027ll follow you to the end of the world, Laila.\"She pulls him close and kisses his lips. She believes she hasnever loved him more than at this moment. \"Thank you,\" shesays, her forehead resting against his. \n \"Let\u0027s go home.\"\"But first, I want to go to Herat,\" she says. \n \"Herat?\"Laila explains. \n * * *The children need reassuring, each in their own way. Lailahas to sit down with an agitated Aziza, who still hasnightmares, who\u0027d been startled to tears the week before whensomeone had shot rounds into the sky at a wedding nearby. \n Laila has to explain to Aziza that when they return to Kabulthe Taliban won\u0027t be there, that there will not be any fighting,and that she will not be sent back to the orphanage. \"We\u0027ll alllive together. Your father, me, Zalmai. And you, Aziza. You\u0027llnever, ever, have to be apart from me again. I promise.\" Shesmiles at her daughter. \"Until the dayyou want to, that is. \n When you fall in love with some young man and want tomarry him.\"On the day they leave Murree, Zalmai is inconsolable. He haswrapped his arms around Alyona\u0027s neck and will not let go. \n \"I can\u0027t pry him off of her, Mammy,\" says Aziza. \n \"Zalmai. We can\u0027t take a goat on the bus,\" Laila explainsagain. \n It isn\u0027t until Tariq kneels down beside him, until he promisesZalmai that he will buy him a goat just like Alyona in Kabul,that Zalmai reluctantly lets go. \n There are tearful farewells with Sayeed as well For good luck,he holds a Koran by the doorway for Tariq, Laila, and thechildren to kiss three times, then holds it high so they canpass under it. He helps Tariq load the two suitcases into thetrunk of his car. It is Sayeed who drives them to the station,who stands on the curb waving good-bye as the bus sputtersand pulls away. \n As she leans back and watches Sayeed receding in the rearwindow of the bus, Laila hears the voice of doubt whispering inher head. Are they being foolish, she wonders, leaving behindthe safety of Murree? Going back to the land where herparents and brothers perished, where the smoke of bombs isonly now settling? \n And then, from the darkened spirals of her memory, rise twolines of poetry, Babi\u0027s farewell ode to Kabul: \n One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs,Or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her -walls. \n Laila settles back in her seat, blinking the wetness from hereyes. Kabul is waiting. Needing. This journey home is the rightthing to do. \n But first there is one last farewell to be said. \n * * *The wars in Afghanistan have ravaged the roads connectingKabul, Herat, and Kandahar. The easiest way to Herat now isthrough Mashad, in Iran. Laila and her family are there onlyovernight. They spend the night at a hotel, and, the nextmorning, they board another bus. \n Mashad is a crowded, bustling city. Laila watches as parks,mosques, andchelo kebab restaurants pass by. When the buspasses the shrine to Imam Reza, the eighth Shi\u0027a imam, Lailacranes her neck to get a better view of its glistening tiles, theminarets, the magnificent golden dome, all of it immaculatelyand lovingly preserved. She thinks of the Buddhas in her owncountry. They are grains of dust now, blowing about theBamiyan Valley in the wind. \n The bus ride to the Iranian-Afghan border takes almost tenhours. The terrain grows more desolate, more barren, as theynear Afghanistan. Shortly before they cross the border intoHerat, they pass an Afghan refugee camp. To Laila, it is a blurof yellow dust and black tents and scanty structures made ofcorrugated-steel sheets. She reaches across the seat and takesTariq\u0027s hand. \n * * *In Herat, most of the streets are paved, lined with fragrantpines. There are municipal parks and libraries in reconstruction,manicured courtyards, freshly painted buildings. The traffic lightswork, and, most surprisingly to Laila, electricity is steady. Lailahas heard that Herat\u0027s feudal-style warlord, Ismail Khan, hashelped rebuild the city with the considerable customs revenuethat he collects at the Afghan-Iranian border, money that Kabulsays belongs not to him but to the central government. Thereis both a reverential and fearful tone when the taxi driver whotakes them to Muwaffaq Hotel mentions Ismail Khan\u0027s name. \n The two-night stay at the Muwaffaq will cost them nearly afifth of their savings, but the trip from Mashad has been longand wearying, and the children are exhausted. The elderly clerkat the desk tells Tariq, as he fetches the room key, that theMuwaffaq is popular with journalists and NGO workers. \n \"Bin Laden slept here once,\" he boasts. \n The room has two beds, and a bathroom with running coldwater. There is a painting of the poet Khaja Abdullah Ansaryon the wall between the beds. From the window, Laila has aview of the busy street below, and of a park across the streetwith pastel-colored-brick paths cutting through thick clusters offlowers. The children, who have grown accustomed to television,are disappointed that there isn\u0027t one in the room. Soonenough, though, they are asleep. Soon enough, Tariq and Lailatoo have collapsed. Laila sleeps soundly in Tariq\u0027s arms, exceptfor once in the middle of the night when she wakes from adream she cannot remember. \n * * *The next morning, after a breakfast of tea with fresh bread,quince marmalade, and boiled eggs, Tariq finds her a taxi. \n \"Are you sure you don\u0027t want me to come along?\" Tariq says. \n Aziza is holding his hand Zalmai isn\u0027t, but he is standing closeto Tariq, leaning one shoulder on Tariq\u0027s hip. \n \"I\u0027m sure.\"\"I worry.\"\"I\u0027ll be fine,\" Laila says. \"I promise. Take the children to amarket. Buy them something.\"Zalmai begins to cry when the taxi pulls away, and, whenLaila looks back, she sees that he is reaching for Tariq. Thathe is beginning to accept Tariq both eases and breaks Laila\u0027sheart. \n * * *\"You\u0027re not from herat,\" the driver says. \n He has dark, shoulder-length hair-a common thumbing of thenose at the departed Taliban, Laila has discovered-and somekind of scar interrupting his mustache on the left side. There isa photo taped to the windshield, on his side. It\u0027s of a younggirl with pink cheeks and hair parted down the middle intotwin braids. \n Laila tells him that she has been in Pakistan for the last year,that she is returning to Kabul. \"Deh-Mazang.\"Through the windshield, she sees coppersmiths welding brasshandles to jugs, saddlemakers laying out cuts of rawhide to dryin the sun. \n \"Have you lived here long, brother?\" she asks. \n \"Oh, my whole life. I was born here. I\u0027ve seen everything. \n You remember the uprising?\"Laila says she does, but he goes on. \n \"This was back in March 1979, about nine months before theSoviets invaded. Some angry Heratis killed a few Sovietadvisers, so the Soviets sent in tanks and helicopters andpounded this place. For three days,hamshira, they fired on thecity. They collapsed buildings, destroyed one of the minarets,killed thousands of people.Thousands. I lost two sisters in thosethree days. One of them was twelve years old.\" He taps thephoto on his windshield. \"That\u0027s her.\"\"I\u0027m sorry,\" Laila says, marveling at how every Afghan story ismarked by death and loss and unimaginable grief. And yet, shesees, people find a way to survive, to go on. Laila thinks ofher own life and all that has happened to her, and she isastonished that she too has survived, that she is alive andsitting in this taxi listening to this man\u0027sstory. \n * * *Gul Daman is a village of a few walled houses rising amongflatkolbas built with mud and straw. Outside thekolbas, Lailasees sunburned women cooking, their faces sweating in steamrising from big blackened pots set on makeshift firewood grills. \n Mules eat from troughs. Children giving chase to chickens beginchasing the taxi. Laila sees men pushing wheelbarrows filledwith stones. They stop and watch the car pass by. The drivertakes a turn, and they pass a cemetery with a weather-wornmausoleum in the center of it. The driver tells her that avillage Sufi is buried there. \n There is a windmill too. In the shadow of its idle, rust-coloredvanes, three little boys are squatting, playing with mud. Thedriver pulls over and leans out of the window. Theoldest-looking of the three boys is the one to answer. Hepoints to a house farther up the road. The driver thanks him,puts the car back in gear. \n He parks outside the walled, one-story house. Laila sees thetops of fig trees above the walls, some of the branches spillingover the side. \n \"I won\u0027t be long,\" she says to the driver. \n * * *The middle-aged man who opens the door is short, thin,russet-haired. His beard is streaked with parallel stripes of gray. \n He is wearing achapan over hispirhan-tumban. \n They exchangesalaam alaykums. \n \"Is this Mullah Faizullah\u0027s house?\" Laila asks. \n \"Yes. I am his son, Hamza. Is there something I can do foryou,hamshireh? ” \n \"I\u0027ve come here about an old friend of your father\u0027s, Mariam.\"Hamza blinks. A puzzled look passes across his face. \n \"Mariam…\"\"Jalil Khan\u0027s daughter.\"He blinks again. Then he puts a palm to his cheek and hisface lights up with a smile that reveals missing and rottingteeth. \"Oh!\" he says. It comes out sounding likeOhhhhhh, likean expelled breath. \"Oh! Mariam! Are you her daughter? Isshe-\" He is twisting his neck now, looking behind her eagerly,searching. \"Is she here? It\u0027s been so long! Is Mariam here?\"\"She has passed on, I\u0027m afraid.\"The smile fades from Hamza\u0027s face. \n For a moment, they stand there, at the doorway, Hamzalooking at the ground. A donkey brays somewhere. \n \"Come in,\" Hamza says. He swings the door open. \"Pleasecome in.\"* * *They srr on the floor in a sparsely furnished room. There isa Herati rug on the floor, beaded cushions to sit on, and aframed photo of Mecca on the wall They sit by the openwindow, on either side of an oblong patch of sunlight- Lailahears women\u0027s voices whispering from another room. A littlebarefoot boy places before them a platter of green tea andpistachiogaaz nougats. Hamza nods at him. \n \"My son.\"The boy leaves soundlessly. \n \"So tell me,\" Hamza says tiredly. \n Laila does. She tells him everything. It takes longer than she\u0027dimagined. Toward the end, she struggles to maintaincomposure. It still isn\u0027t easy, one year later, talking aboutMariam. \n When she\u0027s done, Hamza doesn\u0027t say anything for a longtime. He slowly turns his teacup on its saucer, one way, thenthe other. \n \"My father, may he rest in peace, was so very fond of her,\"he says at last. \"He was the one who sangazan in her earwhen she was born, you know. He visited her every week,never missed. Sometimes he took me with him. He was hertutor, yes, but he was a friend too. He was a charitable man,my father. It nearly broke him when Jalil Khan gave heraway.\"\"I\u0027m sorry to hear about your father. May God forgive him.\"Hamza nods his thanks. \"He lived to be a very old man. Heoutlived Jalil Khan, in fact. We buried him in the villagecemetery, not far from where Mariam\u0027s mother is buried. Myfather was a dear, dear man, surely heaven-bound.\"Laila lowers her cup. \n \"May I ask you something?\"\"Of course.\"\"Can you show me?\" she says. \"Where Mariam lived. Canyou take me there?\"* * *The driver agrees to wait awhile longer. \n Hamza and Laila exit the village and walk downhill on theroad that connects Gul Daman to Herat. After fifteen minutesor so, he points to a narrow gap in the tall grass that flanksthe road on both sides. \n \"That\u0027s how you get there,\" he says. \"There is a path there.\"The path is rough, winding, and dim, beneath the vegetationand undergrowth. The wind makes the tall grass slam againstLaila\u0027s calves as she and Hamza climb the path, take the turns. \n On either side of them is a kaleidoscope of wilciflowers swayingin the wind, some tall with curved petals, others low, fan-leafed. \n Here and there a few ragged buttercups peep through the lowbushes. Laila hears the twitter of swallows overhead and thebusy chatter of grasshoppers underfoot. \n They walk uphill this way for two hundred yards or more. \n Then the path levels, and opens into a flatter patch of land. \n They stop, catch their breath. Laila dabs at her brow with hersleeve and bats at a swarm of mosquitoes hovering in front ofher face. Here she sees the low-slung mountains in thehorizon, a few cottonwoods, some poplars, various wild bushesthat she cannot name. \n \"There used to be a stream here,\" Hamza says, a little out ofbreath. \"But it\u0027s long dried up now.\"He says he will wait here. He tells her to cross the drystreambed, walk toward the mountains. \n \"I\u0027ll wait here,\" he says, sitting on a rock beneath a poplar. \n \"You go on.\"\"I won\u0027t-\"\"Don\u0027t worry. Take your time. Go on,hamshireh. \"Laila thanks him. She crosses the streambed, stepping fromone stone to another. She spots broken soda bottles amid therocks, rusted cans, and a mold-coated metallic container with azinc lid half buried in the ground. \n She heads toward the mountains, toward the weeping willows,which she can see now, the long drooping branches shakingwith each gust of wind. In her chest, her heart is drumming. \n She sees that the willows are arranged as Mariam had said, ina circular grove with a clearing in the middle. Laila walks faster,almost running now. She looks back over her shoulder andsees that Hamza is a tiny figure, hischapan a burst of coloragainst the brown of the trees\u0027 bark. She trips over a stoneand almost falls, then regains her footing. She hurries the restof the way with the legs of her trousers pulled up. She ispanting by the time she reaches the willows. \n Mariam\u0027skolba is still here. \n When she approaches it, Laila sees that the lone windowpaneis empty and that the door is gone. Mariam had described achicken coop and a tandoor, a wooden outhouse too, but Lailasees no sign of them. She pauses at the entrance to thekolbaShe can hear flies buzzing inside. \n To get in, she has to sidestep a large fluttering spiderweb. It\u0027sdim inside. Laila has to give her eyes a few moments toadjust. When they do, she sees that the interior is even smallerthan she\u0027d imagined. Only half of a single rotting, splinteredboard remains of the floorboards. The rest, she imagines, havebeen ripped up for burning as firewood. The floor is carpetednow with dry-edged leaves, broken bottles, discarded chewinggum wrappers, wild mushrooms, old yellowed cigarette butts. \n But mostly with weeds, some stunted, some springingimpudently halfway up the walls. \n Fifteen years, Laila thinks. Fifteen years in this place. \n Laila sits down, her back to the wall. She listens to the windfiltering through the willows. There are more spiderwebsstretched across the ceiling. Someone has spray-paintedsomething on one of the walls, but much of it has sloughedoff, and Laila cannot decipher what it says. Then she realizesthe letters are Russian. There is a deserted bird\u0027s nest in onecorner and a bat hanging upside down in another corner,where the wall meets the low ceiling. \n Laila closes her eyes and sits there awhile. \n In Pakistan, it was difficult sometimes to remember the detailsof Mariam\u0027s face. There were times when, like a word on thetip of her tongue, Mariam\u0027s face eluded her. But now, here inthis place, it\u0027s easy to summon Mariam behind the lids of hereyes: the soft radiance of her gaze, the long chin, thecoarsened skin of her neck, the tight-lipped smile. Here, Lailacan lay her cheek on the softness of Mariam\u0027s lap again, canfeel Mariam swaying back and forth, reciting verses from theKoran, can feel the words vibrating down Mariam\u0027s body, toher knees, and into her own ears. \n Then, suddenly, the weeds begin to recede, as if something ispulling them by the roots from beneath the ground. They sinklower and lower until the earth in thekolba has swallowed thelast of their spiny leaves. The spiderwebs magically unspinthemselves. The bird\u0027s nest self-disassembles, the twigs snappingloose one by one, flying out of thekolba end over end. Aninvisible eraser wipes the Russian graffiti off the wall. \n The floorboards are back. Laila sees a pair of sleeping cotsnow, a wooden table, two chairs, a cast-iron stove in thecorner, shelves along the walls, on which sit clay pots andpans, a blackened teakettle, cups and spoons. She hearschickens clucking outside, the distant gurgling of the stream. \n A young Mariam is sitting at the table making a doll by theglow of an oil lamp. She\u0027s humming something. Her face issmooth and youthful, her hair washed, combed back. She hasall her teeth. \n Laila watches Mariam glue strands of yam onto her doll\u0027shead. In a few years, this little girl will be a woman who willmake small demands on life, who will never burden others,who will never let on that she too has had sorrows,disappointments, dreams that have been ridiculed. A womanwho will be like a rock in a riverbed, enduring withoutcomplaint, her grace not sullied butshaped by the turbulencethat washes over her. Already Laila sees something behind thisyoung girl\u0027s eyes, something deep in her core, that neitherRasheed nor the Taliban will be able to break. Something ashard and unyielding as a block of limestone. Something that, inthe end, will beher undoing and Laila\u0027s salvation. \n The little girl looks up. Puts down the doll. Smiles. \n Laila jo? \n Laila\u0027s eyes snap open. She gasps, and her body pitchesforward. She startles the bat, which zips from one end ofthekolba to the other, its beating wings like the fluttering pagesof a book, before it flies out the window. \n Laila gets to her feet, beats the dead leaves from the seat ofher trousers. She steps out of thekolba Outside, the light hasshifted slightly. A wind is blowing, making the grass ripple andthe willow branches click. \n Before she leaves the clearing, Laila takes one last look atthekolba where Mariam had slept, eaten, dreamed, held herbreath for Jalil. On sagging walls, the willows cast crookedpatterns that shift with each gust of wind. A crow has landedon the flat roof. It pecks at something, squawks, flies off. \n \"Good-bye, Mariam.\"And, with that, unaware that she is weeping, Laila begins torun through the grass. \n She finds Hamza still sitting on the rock. When he spots her,he stands up. \n \"Let\u0027s go back,\" he says. Then, \"I have something to giveyou.\"* * *Laila watts for Hamza in the garden by the front door. Theboy who had served them tea earlier is standing beneath oneof the fig trees holding a chicken, watching her impassively. \n Laila spies two faces, an old woman and a young girl inhijabobserving her demurely from a window. \n The door to the house opens and Hamza emerges. He iscarrying a box. \n He gives it to Laila. \n \"Jalil Khan gave this to my father a month or so before hedied/\u0027 Hamza says. \"He asked my father to safeguard it forMariam until she came to claim it. My father kept it for twoyears. Then, just before he passed away, he gave it to me,and asked me to save it for Mariam. But she…you know, shenever came.\"Laila looks down at the oval-shaped tin box. It looks like anold chocolate box. It\u0027s olive green, with fading gilt scrolls allaround the hinged lid There is a little rust on the sides, andtwo tiny dents on the front rim of the lid. Laila tries to openthe box, but the latch is locked. \n \"What\u0027s in it?\" she asks. \n Hamza puts a key in her palm. \"My father never unlocked it. \n Neither did 1.Isuppose it was God\u0027s will that it be you.\"* * *Back at the hotel, Tariq and the children are not back yet. \n Laila sits on the bed, the box on her lap. Part of her wantsto leave it unopened, let whatever Jalil had intended remain asecret. But, in the end, the curiosity proves too strong. Sheslides in the key. It takes some rattling and shaking, but sheopens the box. \n In it, she finds three things: an envelope, a burlap sack, anda videocassette. \n Laila takes the tape and goes down to the reception desk. \n She learns from the elderly clerk who had greeted them theday before that the hotel has only one VCR, in its biggest suite. \n The suite is vacant at the moment, and he agrees to take her. \n He leaves the desk to a mustachioed young man in a suit whois talking on a cellular phone. \n The old clerk leads Laila to the second floor, to a door at theend of a long hallway. He works the lock, lets her in. \n Laila\u0027s eyes find the TV in the corner. They register nothingelse about the suite-She turns on the TV, turns on the VCR. \n Puts the tape in and pushes the play button. The screen isblank for a few moments, and Laila begins to wonder why Jalilhad gone to the trouble of passing a blank tape to Mariam. \n But then there is music, and images begin to play on thescreen. \n Laila frowns. She keeps watching for a minute or two. Thenshe pushes stop, fast-forwards the tape, and pushes play again. \n It\u0027s the same film. \n The old man is looking at her quizzically. \n The film playing on the screen is Walt Disney\u0027sPinocchio. Lailadoes not understand. \n * * *Tariq and the children come back to the hotel just after sixo\u0027clock. Aziza runs to Laila and shows her theearrings Tariq has bought for her, silver with an enamelbutterfly on each. Zalmai is clutching an inflatable dolphin thatsqueaks when its snout is squeezed. \n \"How are you?\" Tariq asks, putting his arm around hershoulder. \n \"I\u0027m fine,\" Laila says. \"I\u0027ll tell you later.\"They walk to a nearby kebab house to eat. It\u0027s a small place,with sticky, vinyl tablecloths, smoky and loud But the lamb istender and moist and the bread hot. They walk the streets fora while after. Tariq buys the children rosewater ice cream froma street-side kiosk. They eat, sitting on a bench, the mountainsbehind them silhouetted against the scarlet red of dusk. The airis warm, rich with the fragrance of cedar. \n Laila had opened the envelope earlier when she\u0027d come backto the room after viewing the videotape. In it was a letter,handwritten in blue ink on a yellow, lined sheet of paper. \n It read: \n May 13, 1987My dear Mariam: \n I pray that this letter finds you in good healthAs you kno w, I came to Kabul a month ago to speak withyou. Bui you would not see me. Iwas disappointed but couldnot blame you. In your place, Imight have done the same. Ilostthe privilege of your good graces a long time ago and for thatI only have myself to blame. Bui if you are reading this letter,then you have read the letter that Ilefi at your door. You haveread it and you have come to see Mullah Faizullah, as I hadasked that you do. Iam grateful that you did, Mariam jo. Iamgrateful for this chance to say a few words to you. \n Where do I begin? \n Your father has known so much sorrow since we last spoke,Mariamjo. Your stepmother Afsoon was killed on the first dayof the 1979 uprising. A stray bullet killed your sister Niloufarthat same day. Ican still see her, my Utile Niloufar, doingheadsiands to impress guests. Your brother Farhad joined thejihad in J 980. The Soviets killed him in J 982, just outsideofHelmand. I never got to see his body. I don \u0027i know if youhave children of your own, Mariamjo, but if you do I praythat God look after them and spare you the grief that Ihaveknown. I still dream of them. I still dream of my deadchildren. \n I have dreams of you too, Mariam jo. Imiss you. Imiss thesound of your voice, your laughter. I miss reading to you, andall those times we fished together. Do you remember all thosetimes we fished together? You were a good daughter, Mariamjo, and I cannot ever think of you without feeling shame andregret. Regret… When it comes to you, Mariamjo, I haveoceans of it. I regret that I did not see you the day you cameto Herat. I regret that I did not open the door and take youin. I regret that I did not make you a daughter to me, ihatlleiyou live in that place for all those years. Andfor what? Fearof losing face? Of staining my so-called good name? How Utilethose things matter to me now after all the loss, all the terriblethings Ihave seen in this cursed war. Bui now, of course, it istoo late. Perhaps this is just punishment for those who havebeen heartless, to understand only when nothing can beundone. Now all Ican do is say that you were a gooddaughter, Mariamjo, and that Inever deserved you. Now all Ican do is ask for your forgiveness. So forgive me, Mariamjo. \n Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. \n I am not the wealthy man you once knew. The communistsconfiscated so much of my land, and all of my stores as well. \n But it is petty to complain, for God-for reasons that I do notunderstand-has still blessed me with far more than mostpeople. Since my return from Kabul, Ihave managed to sellwhat Utile remained of my land. I have enclosed for you yourshare of the inheritance. You can see that it is far fromafortune, but it is something. It is something. (You will alsonotice that I have taken the liberty of exchanging the moneyinto dollars. I think it is for the best God alone knows the fateof our own beleaguered currency.)I hope you do not think that I am trying to buy yourforgiveness.

It is a fittingmanner of death, I think, for a weak man. \n Mariamjo,I dare, I dare allow myself the hope that, after you read this,you will be more charitable to me than I ever was to you. \n That you might find it in your heart to come and see yourfather. That you will knock on my door one more time andgive me the chance to open it this time, to welcome you, totake you in my arms, my daughter, as I should have all thoseyears ago. It is a hope as weak as my heart. This I know. ButI will be waiting. I will be listening for your knock I will behoping. \n May God grant you a long and prosperous life, my daughter. \n May God give you many healthy and beautiful children. Mayyou find the happiness, peace, and acceptance that I did notgive you. Be well. I leave you in the loving hands of God. \n Your undeserving father, JalilThat night, after they return to the hotel, after the childrenhave played and gone to bed, Laila tells Tariq about the letter. \n She shows him the money in the burlap sack.
