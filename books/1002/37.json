{"id":9870,"no":37,"title":"Chapter 37.","content":"Madam SEPTEMBER 1996Iwo and a half years later, Mariam awoke on the morning ofSeptember 27 to the sounds of shouting andwhistling, firecrackers and music. She ran to the living room,found Laila already at the window, Aziza mounted on hershoulders. Laila turned and smiled. \n \"The Taliban are here,\" she said. \n * * *Mariam had first heard of the Taliban two years before, inOctober 1994, when Rasheed had brought home news thatthey had overthrown the warlords in Kandahar and taken thecity. They were a guerrilla force, he said, made up of youngPashtun men whose families had fled to Pakistan during thewar against the Soviets. Most of them had been raised-someeven born-in refugee camps along the Pakistani border, and inPakistani madrasas, where they were schooled inShari\u0027a bymullahs. Their leader was a mysterious, illiterate, one-eyedrecluse named Mullah Omar, who, Rasheed said with someamusement, called himselfAmeer-ul-Mumineeny Leader of theFaithful. \n \"It\u0027s true that these boys have norisha, no roots,\" Rasheedsaid, addressing neither Mariam nor Laila. Ever since the failedescape, two and a half years ago, Mariam knew that she andLaila had become one and the same being to him, equallywretched, equally deserving of his distrust, his disdain anddisregard. When he spoke, Mariam had the sense that he washaving a conversation with himself, or with some invisiblepresence in the room, who, unlike her and Laila, was worthyof his opinions. \n \"They may have no past,\" he said, smoking and looking up atthe ceiling. \"They may know nothing of the world or thiscountry\u0027s history. Yes. And, compared to them, Mariam heremight as well be a university professor. Ha! Alltrue. But look around you. What do you see? Corrupt, greedyMujahideen commanders, armed to the teeth, rich off heroin,declaring jihad on one another and killing everyone inbetween-that\u0027s what. At least the Taliban are pure andincorruptible. At least they\u0027re decent Muslim boys.Wallah, whenthey come, they will clean up this place. They\u0027ll bring peaceand order. People won\u0027t get shot anymore going out for milk. \n No more rockets! Think of it.\"For two years now, the Taliban had been making their waytoward Kabul, taking cities from the Mujahideen, endingfactional war wherever they\u0027d settled. They had captured theHazara commander Abdul Ali Mazari and executed him. Formonths, they\u0027d settled in the southern outskirts of Kabul, firingon the city, exchanging rockets with Ahmad Shah Massoud. \n Earlier in that September of 1996, they had captured the citiesof Jalalabad and Sarobi. \n The Taliban had one thing the Mujahideen did not, Rasheedsaid. They were united. \n \"Let them come,\" he said. \"I, for one, will shower them withrose petals.\"* * *They \"went our that day, the four of them, Rasheed leadingthem from one bus to the next, to greet their new world, theirnew leaders. In every battered neighborhood, Mariam foundpeople materializing from the rubble and moving into thestreets. She saw an old woman wasting handfuls of rice, tossingit at passersby, a drooping, toothless smile on her face. Twomen were hugging by the remains of a gutted building, in thesky above them the whistle, hiss, and pop of a few firecrackersset off by boys perched on rooftops. The national anthemplayed on cassette decks, competing with the honking of cars. \n \"Look, Mayam!\" Aziza pointed to a group of boys runningdown Jadeh Maywand. They were pounding their fists into theair and dragging rusty cans tied to strings. They were yellingthat Massoud and Rabbani had withdrawn from Kabul. \n Everywhere, there were shouts:Ailah-u-akbar! \n Mariam saw a bedsheet hanging from a window on JadehMaywand. On it, someone had painted three words in big,black letters: zendabaad taliban! Long live the Taliban! \n As they walked the streets, Mariam spotted more signs-paintedon windows, nailed to doors, billowing from car antennas-thatproclaimed the same. \n * * *Mariam sawher first of the Taliban later that day, atPashtunistan Square, with Rasheed, Laila, and Aziza. A melee ofpeople had gathered there. Mariam saw people craning theirnecks, people crowded around the blue fountain in the centerof the square, people perched on its dry bed. They were tryingto get a view of the end of the square, near the old KhyberRestaurant. \n Rasheed used his size to push and shove past the onlookers,and led them to where someone was speaking through aloudspeaker. \n When Aziza saw, she let out a shriek and buried her face inMariam\u0027s burqa. \n The loudspeaker voice belonged to a slender, bearded youngman who wore a black turban. He was standing on some sortof makeshift scaffolding. In his free hand, he held a rocketlauncher. Beside him, two bloodied men hung from ropes tiedto traffic-light posts. Their clothes had been shredded. Theirbloated faces had turned purple-blue. \n \"I know him,\" Mariam said, \"the one on the left.\"A young woman in front of Mariam turned around and saidit was Najibullah. The other man was his brother. Mariamremembered Najibullah\u0027s plump, mustachioed face, beamingfrom billboards and storefront windows during the Soviet years. \n She would later hear that the Taliban had dragged Najibullahfrom his sanctuary at the UN headquarters near DarulamanPalace. That they had tortured him for hours, then tied his legsto a truck and dragged his lifeless body through the streets. \n \"He killed many, many Muslims!\" the young Talib wasshouting through the loudspeaker. He spoke Farsi with aPashto accent, then would switch to Pashto. He punctuated hiswords by pointing to the corpses with his weapon. \"His crimesare known to everybody. He was a communist and akqfir Thisis what we do with infidels who commit crimes against Islam!\"Rasheed was smirking. \n In Mariam\u0027s arms, Aziza began to cry. \n * * *The following day, Kabul was overrun by trucks. In Khairkhana, in Shar-e-Nau, in Karteh-Parwan, in Wazir Akbar Khanand Taimani, red Toyota trucks weaved through the streets. \n Armed bearded men in black turbans sat in their beds. Fromeach truck, a loudspeaker blared announcements, first in Farsi,then Pashto. The same message played from loudspeakersperched atop mosques, and on the radio, which was nowknown as the Voice ofShort \u0027a. The message was also writtenin flyers, tossed into the streets. Mariam found one in the yard. \n Ourwatanis now known as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. \n These are the laws that we will enforce and you will obey: \n Ail citizens must pray five times a day.

Listen well. Obey.Allah-u-akbar. \n Rasheed turned off the radio. They were sitting on theliving-room floor, eating dinner less than a week after they\u0027dseen Najibullah\u0027s corpse hanging by a rope. \n \"They can\u0027t make half the population stay home and donothing,\" Laila said. \n \"Why not?\" Rasheed said. For once, Mariam agreed with him. \n He\u0027d done the same to her and Laila, in effect, had he not? \n Surely Laila saw that. \n \"This isn\u0027t some village. This isKabul. Women here used topractice law and medicine; they held office in thegovernment-\"Rasheed grinned. \"Spoken like the arrogant daughter of apoetry-reading university man that you are. How urbane, howTajik, of you. You think this is some new, radical idea theTaliban are bringing? Have you ever lived outside of yourprecious little shell in Kabul, mygull Ever cared to visit therealAfghanistan, the south, the east, along the tribal border withPakistan? No? I have. And I can tell you that there are manyplaces in this country that have always lived this way, or closeenough anyhow. Not that you would know.\"\"I refuse to believe it,\" Laila said \"They\u0027re not serious.\"\"What the Taliban did to Najibullah looked serious to me,\"Rasheed said. \"Wouldn\u0027t you agree?\"\"He was a communist! He was the head of the Secret Police.\"Rasheed laughed. \n Mariam heard the answer in his laugh: that in the eyes of theTaliban, being a communist and the leader of the dreadedKHAD made Najibullah onlyslightly more contemptible than awoman. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1838/53256.html","bookId":1002,"book":{"id":1002,"title":"A Thousand Splendid Suns 灿烂千阳","description":"简介： 《灿烂千阳》再次以阿富汗战乱为背景，时空跨越三十年，用细腻感人的笔触描绘了阿富汗旧家族制度下苦苦挣扎的妇女，她们所怀抱的希望、爱情、梦想与所有的失落。《灿烂千阳》一书的主人公玛丽雅姆在阿富汗一个偏远贫穷的地方长大，她想上学，母亲却告诫她：学校怎么会教...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201707/19/14-14-15-92-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1838","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM"}}
