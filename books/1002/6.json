Mariam stood beside Bibi jo, with the women, asMullah Faizullah recited prayers at the graveside and the menlowered Nana\u0027s shrouded body into the ground-Afterward, Jalilwalked Mariam to thekolba, where, in front of the villagers whoaccompanied them, he made a great show of tending toMariam. He collected a few of her things, put them in asuitcase. He sat beside her cot, where she lay down, andfanned her face. He stroked her forehead, and, with awoebegone expression on his face, asked if sheneededanything? anything? - he said it like that, twice. \n \"I want Mullah Faizullah,\" Mariam said. \n \"Of course. He\u0027s outside. I\u0027ll get him for you.\"It was when Mullah Faizullah\u0027s slight, stooping figure appearedin thekolba\u0027s doorway that Mariam cried for the first time thatday. \n \"Oh, Mariam jo.\"He sat next to her and cupped her face in his hands. \"Yougo on and cry, Mariam jo. Go on. There is no shame in it. \n But remember, my girl, what the Koran says, \u0027Blessed is He inWhose hand is the kingdom, and He Who has power over allthings, Who created death and life that He may try you.\u0027 TheKoran speaks the truth, my girl. \n Behind every trial and every sorrow that He makes usshoulder, God has a reason.\"But Mariam could not hear comfort in God\u0027s words. Not thatday. Not then. All she could hear was Nana saying,I\u0027ll die ifyou go. I\u0027ll just die. All she could do was cry and cry and lether tears fall on the spotted, paper-thin skin of MullahFaizullah\u0027s hands. \n * * *On the ride to his house, Jalil sat in the backseat of his carwith Mariam, his arm draped over her shoulder. \n \"You can stay with me, Mariam jo,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve asked themalready to clean a room for you. It\u0027s upstairs. You\u0027ll like it, Ithink. You\u0027ll have a view of the garden.\"For the first time, Mariam could hear him with Nana\u0027s ears. \n She could hear so clearly now the insincerity that had alwayslurked beneath, the hollow, false assurances. She could notbring herself to look at him. \n When the car stopped before Jalil\u0027s house, the driver openedthe door for them and carried Mariam\u0027s suitcase. Jalil guidedher, one palm cupped around each of her shoulders, throughthe same gates outside of which, two days before, Mariam hadslept on the sidewalk waiting for him. Two days before-whenMariam could think of nothing in the world she wanted morethan to walk in this garden with Jalil-felt like another lifetime. \n How could her life have turned upside down so quickly,Mariam asked herself. She kept her gaze to the ground, onher feet, stepping on the gray stone path. She was aware ofthe presence of people in the garden, murmuring, steppingaside, as she and Jalil walked past. She sensed the weight ofeyes on her, looking down from the windows upstairs. \n Inside the house too, Mariam kept her head down. Shewalked on a maroon carpet with a repeating blue-and-yellowoctagonal pattern, saw out of the corner of her eye the marblebases of statues, the lower halves of vases, the frayed ends ofrichly colored tapestries hanging from walls. The stairs she andJalil took were wide and covered with asimilar carpet, naileddown at the base of each step. At the top of the stairs, Jalilled her to the left, down another long, carpeted hallway. Hestopped by one of the doors, opened it, and let her in. \n \"Your sisters Niloufar and Atieh play here sometimes,\" Jalilsaid, \"but mostly we use this as a guest room. You\u0027ll becomfortable here, I think. It\u0027s nice, isn\u0027t it?\"The room had a bed with a green-flowered blanket knit in atightly woven, honeycomb design. The curtains, pulled back toreveal the garden below, matched the blanket. Beside the bedwas a three-drawer chest with a flower vase on it. There wereshelves along the walls, with framed pictures of people Mariamdid not recognize. On one of the shelves, Mariam saw acollection of identical wooden dolls, arranged in a line in orderof decreasing size. \n Jalil saw her looking.\"Matryoshka dolls. I got them in Moscow. \n You can play with them, if you want. No one will mind.\"Mariam sat down on the bed. \n \"Is there anything you want?\" Jalil said. \n Mariam lay down. Closed her eyes. After a while, she heardhim softly shut the door. \n * * *Except for \"when she had to use the bathroom down thehall, Mariam stayed in the room. The girl with the tattoo, theone who had opened the gates to her, brought her meals ona tray: lamb kebab,sabzi, aush soup. Most of it went uneaten. \n Jalil came by several times a day, sat on the bed beside her,asked her if she was all right. \n \"You could eat downstairs with the rest of us,\" he said, butwithout much conviction. He understood a little too readilywhen Mariam said she preferred to eat alone. \n From the window, Mariam watched impassively what she hadwondered about and longed to see for most of her life: thecomings and goings of Jalil\u0027s daily life. Servants rushed in andout of the front gates. A gardener was always trimming bushes,watering plants in the greenhouse. Cars with long, sleek hoodspulled up on the street. From them emerged men in suits,inchapcms and caracul hats, women inhijabs, children withneatly combed hair. And as Mariam watched Jalil shake thesestrangers\u0027 hands, as she saw him cross his palms on his chestand nod to their wives, she knew that Nana had spoken thetruth. She did not belong here. \n But where do I belong? What am I going to do now? \n I\u0027m all you have in this world, Mariam, and when I\u0027m goneyou\u0027ll have nothing. You\u0027ll have nothing. Youarenothing! \n Like the wind through the willows around thekolba, gusts ofan inexpressible blackness kept passing through Mariam. \n On Mariam\u0027s second full day at Jalil\u0027s house, a little girl cameinto the room. \n \"I have to get something,\" she said. \n Mariam sat up on the bed and crossed her legs, pulled theblanket on her lap. \n The girl hurried across the room and opened the closet door. \n She fetched a square-shaped gray box. \n \"You know what this is?\" she said. She opened the box. \"It\u0027scalled a gramophone.Gramo. Phone. It plays records. You know,music. A gramophone.\"\"You\u0027re Niloufar. You\u0027re eight.\"The little girl smiled. She had Jalil\u0027s smile and his dimpledchin. \"How did you know?\"Mariam shrugged. She didn\u0027t say to this girl that she\u0027d oncenamed a pebble after her. \n \"Do you want to hear a song?\"Mariam shrugged again. \n Niloufar plugged in the gramophone. She fished a small recordfrom a pouch beneath the box\u0027s lid. She put it on, lowered theneedle. Music began to play. \n 1 will use a flower petal for paper, And write you the sweetestletter, You are the sultan of my heart, the sultan of my heart\"Do you know it?\"\"No.\"\"It\u0027s from an Iranian film. I saw it at my father\u0027s cinema. Hey,do you want to see something?\"Before Mariam could answer, Niloufar had put her palms andforehead to the ground She pushed with her soles and thenshe was standing upside down, on her head, in a three-pointstance. \n \"Can you do that?\" she said thickly. \n \"No.\"Niloufar dropped her legs and pulled her blouse back down. \n \"I could teach you,\" she said, pushing hair from her flushedbrow. \"So how long will you stay here?\"\"I don\u0027t know.\"\"My mother says you\u0027re not really my sister like you say youare.\"\"I never said I was,\" Mariam lied. \n \"She says you did. I don\u0027t care. What I mean is, I don\u0027t mindif you did say it, or if you are my sister. I don\u0027t mind.\"Mariam lay down. \"I\u0027m tired now.\"\"My mother saysa jinn made your mother hang herself.\"\"You can stop that now,\" Mariam said, turning to her side. \n \"The music, I mean.\"Bibi jo came to see her that day too. It was raining by thetime she came. She lowered her large body onto the chairbeside the bed, grimacing. \n \"This rain, Mariam jo, it\u0027s murder on my hips. Just murder, Itell you. I hope…Oh, now, come here, child. Come here to Bibijo. Don\u0027t cry. There, now. You poor thing.Ask You poor, poorthing.\"That night, Mariam couldn\u0027t sleep for a long time. She lay inbed looking at the sky, listening to the footsteps below, thevoices muffled by walls and the sheets of rain punishing thewindow. When she did doze off, she was startled awake byshouting. Voices downstairs, sharp and angry. Mariam couldn\u0027tmake out the words. Someone slammed a door. \n The next morning, Mullah Faizullah came to visit her. Whenshe saw her friend at the door, his white beard and hisamiable, toothless smile, Mariam felt tears stinging the cornersof her eyes again. She swung her feet over the side of the bedand hurried over. She kissed his hand as always and he herbrow. She pulled him up a chair-He showed her the Koran hehad brought with him and opened it. \"I figured no sense inskipping our routine, eh?\"\"You know I don\u0027t need lessons anymore, Mullah sahib. Youtaught me everysurrah andayat in the Koran years ago.\"He smiled, and raised his hands in a gesture of surrender. \"Iconfess, then. I\u0027ve been found out. But I can think of worseexcuses to visit you.\"\"You don\u0027t need excuses. Not you.\"\"You\u0027re kind to say that, Mariam jo.\"He passed her his Koran. As he\u0027d taught her, she kissed itthree times-touching it to her brow between each kiss-and gaveit back to him. \n \"How are you, my girl?\"\"I keep,\" Mariam began. She had to stop, feeling like a rockhad lodged itself in her throat. \"I keep thinking of what shesaid to me before I left. She-\"\"Nay, nay, nay.\"Mullah Faizullah put his hand on her knee. \n \"Your mother, may Allah forgive her, was a troubled andunhappy woman, Mariam jo. She did a terrible thing to herself. \n To herself, to you, and also to Allah. He will forgive her, forHe is all-forgiving, but Allah is saddened by what she did. Hedoes not approve of the taking of life, be it another\u0027s or one\u0027sown, for He says that life is sacred You see-\" He pulled hischair closer, took Mariam\u0027s hand in both of his own. \"You see,I knew your mother before you were born, when she was alittle girl, and I tell you that she was unhappy then. The seedfor what she did was planted long ago, I\u0027m afraid. What Imean to say is that this was not your fault. It wasn\u0027t yourfault, my girl.\"\"I shouldn\u0027t have left her. I should have-\"\"You stop that. These thoughts are no good, Mariam jo. Youhear me, child? No good. They will destroy you. It wasn\u0027t yourfault. It wasn\u0027t your fault. No.\"Mariam nodded, but as desperately as she wanted to shecould not bring herself to believe him. \n * * *One apternoon, a week later, there was a knock on the door,and a tall woman walked in. She was fair-skinned, had reddishhair and long fingers. \n \"I\u0027m Afsoon,\" she said. \"Niloufar\u0027s mother. Why don\u0027t youwash up, Mariam, and come downstairs?\"Mariam said she would rather stay in her room. \n \"No,nafahmidi, you don\u0027t understand. Youmedio come down. \n We have to talk to you. It\u0027s important.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1838/53225.html","bookId":1002,"book":{"id":1002,"title":"A Thousand Splendid Suns 灿烂千阳","description":"简介： 《灿烂千阳》再次以阿富汗战乱为背景，时空跨越三十年，用细腻感人的笔触描绘了阿富汗旧家族制度下苦苦挣扎的妇女，她们所怀抱的希望、爱情、梦想与所有的失落。《灿烂千阳》一书的主人公玛丽雅姆在阿富汗一个偏远贫穷的地方长大，她想上学，母亲却告诫她：学校怎么会教...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201707/19/14-14-15-92-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1838","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM"}}
