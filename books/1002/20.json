{"id":9853,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 20.","content":"The ailments that would hound Mammy for the rest of herdays began. Chest pains and headaches, joint aches and nightsweats, paralyzing pains in her ears, lumps no one else couldfeel. Babi took her to a doctor, who took blood and urine, shotX-rays of Mammy\u0027s body, but found no physical illness. \\n\\n Mammy lay in bed most days. She wore black. She picked ather hair and gnawed on the mole below her lip. WhenMammy was awake, Laila found her staggering through thehouse. She always ended up in Laila\u0027s room, as though shewould run into the boys sooner or later if she just keptwalking into the room where they had once slept and fartedand fought with pillows. But all she ran into was their absence. \\n\\n And Laila. Which, Laila believed, had become one and thesame to Mammy. \\n\\n The only task Mammy never neglected was her fivedailynamaz prayers. She ended eachnamaz with her head hunglow, hands held before her face, palms up, muttering a prayerfor God to bring victory to the Mujahideen. Laila had toshoulder more and more of the chores. If she didn\u0027t tend tothe house, she was apt to find clothes, shoes, open rice bags,cans of beans, and dirty dishes strewn about everywhere. Lailawashed Mammy\u0027s dresses and changed her sheets. She coaxedher out of bed for baths and meals. She was the one whoironed Babi\u0027s shirts and folded his pants. Increasingly, she wasthe cook. \\n\\n Sometimes, after she was done with her chores, Laila crawledinto bed next to Mammy. She wrapped her arms around her,laced her fingers with her mother\u0027s, buried her face in her hair. \\n\\n Mammy would stir, murmur something. Inevitably, she wouldstart in on a story about the boys. \\n\\n One day, as they were lying this way, Mammy said, \"Ahmadwas going to be a leader. He had the charisma for it-Peoplethree times his age listened to him with respect, Laila. It wassomething to see. And Noon Oh, my Noor. He was alwaysmaking sketches of buildingsand bridges. He was going to bean architect, you know. He was going to transform Kabul withhis designs. And now they\u0027re bothshaheed, my boys, bothmartyrs.\"Laila lay there and listened, wishing Mammy would noticethatshe, Laila, hadn\u0027t becomeshaheed, that she was alive, here,in bed with her, that she had hopes and a future. But Lailaknew that her future was no match for her brothers\u0027 past. \\n\\n They had overshadowed her in life. They would obliterate herin death. Mammy was now the curator of their lives\u0027 museumand she, Laila, a mere visitor. A receptacle for their myths. \\n\\n Theparchment on which Mammy meant to ink their legends. \\n\\n \"The messenger who came with the news, he said that whenthey brought the boys back to camp, Ahmad Shah Massoudpersonally oversaw the burial. He said a prayer for them at thegravesite. That\u0027s the kind of brave young men your brotherswere, Laila, that Commander Massoud himself, the Lion ofPanjshir, God bless him, would oversee their burial.\"Mammy rolled onto her back. Laila shifted, rested her headon Mammy\u0027s chest. \\n\\n \"Some days,\" Mammy said in a hoarse voice, \"I listen to thatclock ticking in the hallway. Then I think of all the ticks, all theminutes, all the hours and days and weeks and months andyears waiting for me. All of it without them. And I can\u0027tbreathe then, like someone\u0027s stepping on my heart, Laila. I getso weak. So weak I just want to collapse somewhere.\"\"I wish there was something I could do,\" Laila said, meaningit. But it came out sounding broad, perfunctory, like the tokenconsolation of a kind stranger. \\n\\n \"You\u0027re a good daughter,\" Mammy said, after a deep sigh. \\n\\n \"And I haven\u0027t been much of a mother to you.\"\"Don\u0027t say that.\"\"Oh, it\u0027s true. I know it and I\u0027m sorry for it, my love.\"\"Mammy?\"\"Mm.\"Laila sat up, looking down at Mammy. There were graystrands in Mammy\u0027s hair now. And it startled Laila howmuchweight Mammy, who\u0027d always been plump, had lost. Hercheeks had a sallow, drawn look. The blouseshe was wearingdrooped over her shoulders, and there was a gaping spacebetween her neck and the collar. More than once Laila hadseen the wedding bandslide off Mammy\u0027s finger. \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been meaning to ask you something.\"\"What is it?\"\"You wouldn\u0027t…\" Laila began. \\n\\n She\u0027d talked about it to Hasina. At Hasina\u0027s suggestion, thetwo of them had emptied the bottle of aspirin in the gutter,hidden the kitchen knives and the sharp kebab skewersbeneath the rug under the couch. Hasina had found a rope inthe yard. When Babi couldn\u0027t find his razors, Laila had to tellhim of her fears. He dropped on the edge of the couch, handsbetween his knees. Laila waited for some kind of reassurancefrom him. But all she got was a bewildered, hollow-eyed look. \\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t…Mammy I worry that-\"\"I thought about it the night we got the news,\" Mammy said. \\n\\n \"I won\u0027t lie to you, I\u0027ve thought about it since too. But, no. \\n\\n Don\u0027t worry, Laila. I want to see my sons\u0027 dream come true. Iwant to see the day the Soviets go home disgraced, the daythe Mujahideen come to Kabul in victory. I want to be therewhen it happens, when Afghanistan is free, so the boys see ittoo. They\u0027ll see it through my eyes.\"Mammy was soon asleep, leaving Laila with dueling emotions: \\n\\n reassured that Mammy meant to live on, stung thatshe wasnot the reason.She would never leave her mark on Mammy\u0027sheart the way her brothers had, because Mammy\u0027s heart waslike a pallid beach where Laila\u0027s footprints would forever washaway beneath the waves of sorrow that swelled and crashed,swelled and crashed. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1838/53239.html","bookId":1002,"book":{"id":1002,"title":"A Thousand Splendid Suns 灿烂千阳","description":"简介： 《灿烂千阳》再次以阿富汗战乱为背景，时空跨越三十年，用细腻感人的笔触描绘了阿富汗旧家族制度下苦苦挣扎的妇女，她们所怀抱的希望、爱情、梦想与所有的失落。《灿烂千阳》一书的主人公玛丽雅姆在阿富汗一个偏远贫穷的地方长大，她想上学，母亲却告诫她：学校怎么会教...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201707/19/14-14-15-92-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1838","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM"}}
