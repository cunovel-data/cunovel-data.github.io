{"id":9876,"no":43,"title":"Chapter 43.","content":"MadamUpstairs, in Mariam\u0027s room, Zalmai was wound up. Hebounced his new rubber basketball around for a while, on thefloor, against the walls. Mariam asked him not to, but he knewthat she had no authority to exert over him and so he wenton bouncing his ball, his eyes holding hers defiantly. For awhile, they pushed his toy car, an ambulance with bold redlettering on the sides, sending it back and forth between themacross the room. \n Earlier, when they had met Tariq at the door, Zalmai hadclutched the basketball close to his chest and stuck a thumb inhis mouth-something he didn\u0027t do anymore except when hewas apprehensive. He had eyed Tariq with suspicion. \n \"Who is that man?\" he said now. \"I don\u0027t like him.\"Mariam was going to explain, say something about him andLaila growing up together, but Zalmai cut her off and said toturn the ambulance around, so the front grille faced him, and,when she did, he said he wanted his basketball again. \n \"Where is it?\" he said. \"Where is the ball Baba jan got me? \n Where is it? I want it! I want it!\" his voice rising andbecoming more shrill with each word. \n \"It was just here,\" Mariam said, and he cried, \"No, it\u0027s lost, Iknow it. I just know it\u0027s lost! Where is it? Where is it?\"\"Here,\" she said, fetching the ball from the closet where it hadrolled to. But Zalmai was bawling now and pounding his fists,crying that it wasn\u0027t the same ball, it couldn\u0027t be, because hisball was lost, and this was a fake one, where had his real ballgone? Where? Where where where? \n He screamed until Laila had to come upstairs to hold him, torock him and run her fingers through his tight, dark curls, todry his moist cheeks and cluck her tongue in his ear. \n Mariam waited outside the room. From atop the staircase, allshe could see of Tariq were his long legs, the real one and theartificial one, in khaki pants, stretched out on the uncarpetedliving-room floor. It was then that she realized why thedoorman at the Continental had looked familiar the day sheand Rasheed had gone there to place the call to Jalil. He\u0027dbeen wearing a cap and sunglasses, that was why it hadn\u0027tcome to her earlier. But Mariam remembered now, from nineyears before, remembered him sitting downstairs, patting hisbrow with a handkerchief and asking for water. Now allmanner of questions raced through her mind: Had the sulfapills too been part of the ruse? Which one of them had plottedthe lie, provided the convincing details? And how much hadRasheed paid Abdul Sharif-if that was even his name-to comeand crush Laila with the story of Tariq\u0027s death? \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1838/53262.html","bookId":1002,"book":{"id":1002,"title":"A Thousand Splendid Suns 灿烂千阳","description":"简介： 《灿烂千阳》再次以阿富汗战乱为背景，时空跨越三十年，用细腻感人的笔触描绘了阿富汗旧家族制度下苦苦挣扎的妇女，她们所怀抱的希望、爱情、梦想与所有的失落。《灿烂千阳》一书的主人公玛丽雅姆在阿富汗一个偏远贫穷的地方长大，她想上学，母亲却告诫她：学校怎么会教...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201707/19/14-14-15-92-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1838","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:08 AM"}}
