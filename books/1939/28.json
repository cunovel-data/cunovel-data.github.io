{"id":66246,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"Suddenly, I couldn\u0027t remember why I\u0027d need to call her. She obviously noticed my blank look. \"For the movie.\" \"Oh, right.\" I felt foolish, but Leanne put me at ease with her smile. Once I was home and sitting in front of the TV with my feet up, I reconsidered that invitation to the movies. Quite frankly I don\u0027t know what had prompted me to suggest it. My plan had been to give myself a day or two to analyze the evening before I pursued the relationship any further. Instead, I\u0027d arranged another date. Perhaps I felt obligated to repay her for the meal. I didn\u0027t know. Not until I turned in for the night did it occur to me that I\u0027d spent most of the evening talking about Macy. Chapter Twenty-Two A lix Turner stuck her head inside Winter\u0027s tiny office at the French Cafe. \"You have a visitor,\" she said. Judging by her smile, Alix seemed pleased about something. She was noticeably pregnant now, and the whole staff was thrilled. Everyone had adopted Alix and, while Winter had never given birth herself, she couldn\u0027t help offering dietary advice and concocting nutritious smoothies. Jordan, who was the most attentive husband she\u0027d ever seen, wanted Alix to stop working, but Alix had convinced him she could continue until she felt too uncomfortable to bake. She also served at the counter when Winter needed a substitute. There were only a few weeks left before her due date, and Winter suspected Alix would work right up until she went into labor. One thing was certain; this baby would have a number of doting godmothers, and she intended to be one of them. Alix\u0027s previous pregnancy had ended in an early miscarriage last summer. That accounted for the extra care Jordan and all her friends lavished on her now. \"A visitor?\" Winter looked up from the food order she was about to complete. \"Who is it?\" she asked automatically. Even as she spoke, she wondered who\u0027d feel a need to be announced. Michael or possibly-- \"It\u0027s Pierre.\" The pen Winter had been holding slipped from her fingers. \"Pierre is here?\" \"Should I send him in?\" Alix asked, her smile widening. She\u0027d always been a champion of his. At times Winter had actually been a little jealous of how well Pierre and Alix got along, of the easy camaraderie between them. Now Pierre was here, when she least expected him. Where she least expected him. She remembered his anger when she\u0027d dropped in to see him, the distant way he\u0027d treated her. In Winter\u0027s opinion, he deserved the same treatment. She dared not let him see how glad she was, how happy his visit made her, how much she craved the sight of him. Contemplating her response, she leaned back in her chair. A moment later she decided he could wait. \"Tell him I\u0027m busy with an order. I\u0027ll be out as soon as I\u0027m done.\" Alix frowned, her hands resting on her protruding stomach. \"Are you sure?\" \"I\u0027m positive.\" Alix left and, smiling to herself, Winter chewed on the end of the pen. So Pierre had actually made the effort to seek her out. This was an interesting development. But seeing how rude and unwelcoming he\u0027d been, a lukewarm reception on her part seemed fitting. Although she suffered a twinge of doubt, she held firm. She tried to concentrate on the order, but her mind kept drifting to Pierre. He\u0027d never been a patient man and she guessed that after ten minutes he\u0027d be furious. Good. Served him right. When she felt he\u0027d probably reached the end of his patience, Winter sauntered out of her office. She paused in the kitchen long enough to pour herself a cup of coffee and then casually walked around the counter to the front of the cafe. Pierre sat at a table next to the window, gazing out at Blossom Street. No one else was seated nearby, although there was a short line at the counter. By ten-thirty, the morning crowd had dwindled to a handful who\u0027d stopped in during their coffee breaks. In another hour, they\u0027d get a rush of lunch orders. The soup du jour, baked potato sprinkled with grated cheddar cheese and fresh chives, was popular with her customers, so the cafe was bound to do brisk business. Pierre looked up as she approached, and it gave her a degree of satisfaction to see his eyes narrow. His coffee cup was empty and the croissant only half-eaten. \"I hope you didn\u0027t find anything wrong with my croissant,\" she said as she slipped into the chair across from him. \"Quite the opposite. It was excellent as always.\" Pierre\u0027s spine was as stiff as his compliment. Winter shrugged lightly. \"I apologize for keeping you waiting.\" His mouth tensed, and he shook his head as if he\u0027d grown tired of the old games, the playacting they both indulged in. \"Don\u0027t say things you don\u0027t mean.\" \"Like what?\" She opened her eyes wide in exaggerated innocence. \"That you regret keeping me waiting. You did that intentionally and we both know it. You wanted me to be aware that you had more important tasks requiring your attention.\" Winter didn\u0027t bother to deny it. She hadn\u0027t fooled him in the slightest. She\u0027d meant to punish him. But the pleasure of vengeance had already begun to recede. \"What can I do for you?\" Winter asked smoothly. He didn\u0027t answer for a long time. \"Rien du tout. Nothing at all.\" He started to rise, and Winter stretched out her arm, placing her hand over his. \"Surely you had a reason for coming here.\" Pierre had half risen from the chair. He sat back down, his dark eyes holding hers. \"I thought we should talk.\" She smiled and nodded, wanting to encourage him, wanting him to acknowledge that he missed her as much as she missed him. Nothing seemed truly right without Pierre and yet she wasn\u0027t sure how to make their relationship work. Spending time with Michael Everett had been pleasant, but while she enjoyed his company, it was Pierre she loved, Pierre who was her soul mate, Pierre who was always on her mind. After a lengthy hesitation, he said, \"I came because I felt bad about the last time we spoke.\" She frowned at the memory. \"You were rude.\" \"I was busy,\" he snapped. \"I had three banquets that evening, and two of the kitchen staff phoned in sick. What would you have me do? You could have checked with me first, could have given me some warning. You know what it\u0027s like in the kitchen.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me this at the time?\" If he could snap at her, she could snap back. Then, because she did know how crazy life could get in a large hotel kitchen, she added, \"Okay, I should\u0027ve phoned first. But I didn\u0027t deserve to have my head bitten off. Besides, if I had called, you wouldn\u0027t have answered and then I would\u0027ve come anyway, so it\u0027s irrelevant.\" \"How do you know whether I would have answered or not?\" he demanded. \"To say I would ignore a call from you is an insult.\" \"Then consider yourself insulted.\" Winter drew in a deep breath and closed her eyes. It always ended like this. She\u0027d be so happy to see Pierre, and then they\u0027d start sniping at each other, and before she could figure out why, they\u0027d be in the middle of an argument. One look at Pierre told her he was as frustrated as she was. \"Why do we always fight?\" she asked, sick at heart. No one else affected her this way. Only Pierre was capable of twisting her emotions into such an impossible knot. Pierre was silent for a few seconds. \"Why do we fight?\" he repeated, as if he, too, had lost any hope of finding a solution. \"If I had the answer to that, you and I would be married by now and starting our own family.\" His eyes went to the counter, where Alix was serving coffee and croissants. They\u0027d talked of marriage and children. That, at least, was a subject on which they could easily agree. It was everything else that ended in argument. Neither of them wanted this constant bickering and yet they seemed unable to avoid it. \"I suppose you expect an apology for what I said that afternoon,\" he muttered, returning to their earlier conversation. \"Getting me to admit I was wrong seems inordinately important to you.\" \"You should apologize.\" \"What about you?\" he blazed. \"What did I do that was so wrong?\" \"Do you actually need me to tell you?\" \"Yes, I do,\" Winter said. \"First of all, we both agreed upon no contact for three months. N\u0027est-ce pas?\" Okay, she\u0027d broken their agreement. So what? She\u0027d had something to tell him and it seemed best to do it in person. \"I had a reason.\" \"Sure you did. You wanted to shove the fact that you were dating some other man in my face.\" \"That is not true.\" She clenched her hands involuntarily. Pierre turned everything back on her, made everything her fault. He had no idea how unfair he was being, how unreasonable. \"Don\u0027t deceive yourself, Winter.\" He wagged his index finger as if he\u0027d caught her in a lie. \"That is exactly why you showed up on the most hectic day I\u0027ve had all year.\" \"We\u0027d never discussed it, and I felt you should know.\" \"Why? So I would miss you more? So I would beg you not to go out with this doctor? To remain faithful to me? If you\u0027re waiting for me to plead with you, you\u0027ll have a long wait.\" \"Fine, whatever.\" \"Fine with me, too.\" Pierre crossed his arms and scowled at her. This was getting them nowhere. It felt as though they performed the same roles, recited the same lines, every time they were together. She\u0027d grown so weary of it; Pierre had, too. \"If it makes you feel any better,\" she said, \"you should know I\u0027ve always been faithful to you.\" He arched a brow, implying that was no concern of his. His nonchalant attitude irritated her even more. \"Don\u0027t you care if I date another man?\" she asked. He shrugged. \"Why should I?\" \"At one time we seriously considered getting married!\" \"Thank God we didn\u0027t make that mistake.\" His words were like a knife he\u0027d sunk into her heart. Pierre knew how badly she\u0027d wanted to marry him. Swallowing painfully, she asked, \"Why do you have to say such ugly things to me?\" She hated the small quaver in her voice. \"Ma cherie, be reasonable. If we\u0027d married we\u0027d have killed each other by now.\" \"That\u0027s not true!\" \"Look at us,\" he said, gesturing toward her with one hand, then bringing it back to his chest. \"We can\u0027t even have a conversation without aiming for each other\u0027s throat. Something is very wrong with us. I don\u0027t know what it is...I wish I did. I thought...I hoped that when we got back together the last time our problems had been resolved, but nothing\u0027s changed.\" The sadness in his voice echoed her own feelings, although pride wouldn\u0027t allow her to show it. \"This three-month separation idea of yours is for the best.\" Winter disagreed, but it was hard to admit that; as he\u0027d pointed out, it had been her suggestion. She\u0027d regretted it almost every day since. At the time she\u0027d been so sure Pierre would fight to keep their relationship intact. Three months apart had felt like an eternity then. It still felt like one now. She\u0027d been the first to break their agreement. That should\u0027ve told him something about her feelings. She didn\u0027t know why it was like this with them. How she longed for the early days of their relationship, before they\u0027d fallen into this pattern of destructive behavior, of belittling each other in this crazy reflexive way. \"So you want to continue with our separation?\" she said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-28.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;.
