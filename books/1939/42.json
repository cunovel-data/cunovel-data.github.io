{"id":66260,"no":42,"title":"Page 42","content":"I swallowed tightly, instinctively knowing this involved Macy. \"If you\u0027ll excuse me a moment?\" I said to my friends. I set my linen napkin beside my plate and stood. Sure enough, it was Macy. She stood at the entrance to the ballroom, arguing with one of the security guards. I blinked when I saw her. The dress she\u0027d previewed for me the night before was nowhere in sight. Instead, she had on a housedress that resembled something my grandmother might have worn. She clutched a large purse to her chest as though it held every valuable she possessed. \"Macy,\" I said. \"Is there a problem?\" I directed the question to the guard. \"Michael! Oh, thank goodness you\u0027re here. Would you kindly inform this...this man,\" she said in righteous tones, \"that I am not a street person trying to crash this dinner and that I\u0027m your invited guest?\" The man employed by the hotel regarded me skeptically. \"Is she with you?\" \"She is.\" I placed my arm protectively around Macy\u0027s shoulders. \"Do you have your dinner ticket?\" \"I...I couldn\u0027t find it.\" She draped the oversize purse over her arm and let it dangle. \"Not to worry,\" I said, frowning at the security guard. \"If need be, I\u0027ll purchase another.\" \"That won\u0027t be necessary,\" he said and walked off. Seeing how upset Macy was and because the two of us had become the focus of attention--I gently eased her into the lobby and away from the ballroom. \"Oh, Michael, I\u0027m so sorry.\" \"What happened?\" I asked as I hugged her close. She trembled in my arms. \"The taping went much later than I expected,\" she whispered. That much I\u0027d figured out. \"I guess you didn\u0027t have time to change clothes.\" She must\u0027ve been wearing what she\u0027d had on for the commercial shoot. Macy nodded, her face against my shoulder. \"I didn\u0027t know I was doing two scenes. The first was the modernday grocery store and the second was from the 1960s. If I\u0027d gone home and changed, I would\u0027ve missed the dinner entirely.\" \"It\u0027s all right.\" \"No, it isn\u0027t,\" she said, sounding close to tears. \"All I\u0027ve done is embarrass you. I can\u0027t stay.\" \"Of course you can. I want you to meet my friends. I\u0027m not embarrassed--I\u0027m proud of you.\" She shook her head. \"I can\u0027t...I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027ve ruined everything.\" Clasping her shoulders, I held her back from me and looked down into her face. \"Don\u0027t be silly,\" I said, reaching for her hands. \"Come inside with me and have some dinner. You\u0027ll feel better once you do.\" \"I can\u0027t.... I shouldn\u0027t have come, but I couldn\u0027t let you down...I just couldn\u0027t.\" She buried her face in her hands, and, seeing how distraught she was, I realized it would be even more upsetting for her to walk through the ballroom in full view of everyone. \"Do you want to go home?\" I asked. \"Yes,\" she said in a high-pitched squeak. Reluctantly, I nodded. I put my arms around her again, hoping to comfort and reassure her. We stood entwined that way for perhaps a minute-- until we were interrupted by Ritchie, rushing out of the ballroom. \"Michael! They\u0027re getting ready to announce the awards.\" \"Okay. I\u0027ll be there.\" Macy broke the embrace and smiled up at me. \"I\u0027m fine. Go back inside.\" Ritchie looked at Macy and then at me, then back at Macy. He pulled me aside. \"This is Macy?\" he asked as though he couldn\u0027t believe his eyes. \"She came directly from the commercial shoot,\" I told him. \"Oh.\" He regarded me thoughtfully. Then in a lower voice, he asked, \"Hannah\u0027s Macy?\" \"No,\" I said, \"my Macy.\" \"Oh.\" I\u0027d rarely seen my brother-in-law at a loss for words, but Ritchie clearly wasn\u0027t sure what to say. He opened his mouth, closed it again, then turned away, disappearing inside the ballroom. \"That was my brother-in-law,\" I said. \"I didn\u0027t think you wanted me to introduce you just yet.\" She nodded mutely. \"I\u0027ll stop by the house when I\u0027m finished here,\" I promised her. My proposal could wait for another time. Macy stared up at me, her eyes bright with unshed tears, then flung her arms around my neck and kissed me hard. The tears were flowing in earnest when she released me. Before I could say anything she fled down the hallway. Her tears, and the desperate way she\u0027d kissed me, alerted me to the fact that something was wrong. I would have followed her if I hadn\u0027t heard my name over the speakers. When I stepped back into the ballroom, I saw people glancing in my direction and discovered I\u0027d won the award. The rest of the evening was like a bad dream. I kept looking for an excuse to leave, but I was thwarted at every turn. Because I was the winner, I had to remain after the banquet for a short interview with the Seattle Times. Then the photographer showed up. When I left the hotel, it was almost eleven. But I didn\u0027t care how late it was. I was going to Macy\u0027s house. Despite the positive events of the evening, I had an anxious feeling about Macy. As soon as I pulled up in front of her fairy-tale house, I noticed that all the lights were off. Only the porch was illuminated. Undaunted, I climbed out of the car and hurried up the sidewalk. As I neared the front door, I saw an envelope taped to the screen door, addressed to me. I couldn\u0027t forget that my relationship with Macy had begun with another letter. The one from Hannah. Standing directly under the porch light, I ripped open the envelope and withdrew the single sheet of paper. July 2 Michael, I can\u0027t do it. I\u0027m so sorry. Can\u0027t do what? I wondered. Hannah made a mistake. I\u0027m not the right kind of woman for you. I\u0027ll embarrass and humiliate you the way I did tonight. She hadn\u0027t embarrassed me. When I discovered I\u0027d fallen in love with Macy, I\u0027d accepted that she was herself, her quirky, madcap, independent self. Those were the very qualities I now found so attractive, so appealing. So different from me. Best for whom? Not me. My initial reaction was to argue, except that I didn\u0027t have anyone to argue with. I don\u0027t want to see you again. I know you probably think I\u0027m being emotional and that this is an impulsive decision on my part. It isn\u0027t. I\u0027m taking the cats and leaving for a while. This is for the best. I don\u0027t know when I\u0027ll be back but I can assure you it won\u0027t be soon. Put me out of your mind and look for a woman more suited to your world. And thank you, oh, thank you for loving me. I just wish I could be different. Macy P.S. Sammy\u0027s with Harvey. I hope you\u0027ll keep an eye on them both. I read the letter a second time, crumpled it and dropped it on the porch before I turned and walked away. Macy wanted to get out of my life. It was what I suspected she\u0027d do after disappearing from my office that day--was it only two weeks ago? This was a pattern of hers. Uncompleted paintings and unfinished relationships. Hannah had gotten it all wrong. Chapter Thirty-Three M ark\u0027s sister sat across from Leanne in the Lancasters\u0027 kitchen. It was after midnight and, while his parents had gone to their bedroom, Leanne doubted that either of them slept. Mark had been missing in Afghanistan for a week--the longest week of Leanne\u0027s life. A day earlier, the country had celebrated the Fourth of July and the fireworks display had lit up the evening sky. The Lancaster family felt they had little to celebrate, and yet they\u0027d stood with Denise\u0027s daughters and made a small display of patriotism for the sake of the children, who didn\u0027t fully understand what had taken place. So far, the disappearance of two Americans in Afghanistan had been kept out of the news. For that Leanne was grateful, although she wasn\u0027t sure whether McPherson would be able to keep the incident under wraps much longer. She feared that in short order the information would be uncovered by the press. Then any privacy would be destroyed and the men\u0027s safety might well be compromised. In contrast to last evening\u0027s loud fireworks, now there was only silence in the darkness of the summer night. The kitchen seemed to vibrate with stress as the two women sat there. Denise had come to Spokane the Friday before the holiday. She and her daughters slept in the spare bedroom. Until they\u0027d arrived, Leanne had slept there, but she\u0027d given it up for her sister-in-law and nieces. For the past three nights she\u0027d bunked down on the living room sofa. She needed to go back to Seattle. She couldn\u0027t continue putting her life on hold. Although the company had been good about updating the family, there was no real news. Her sense of hope escalated with each phone call and then plummeted just as quickly. No one slept for more than a few hours at a time. The only positive note was that while they were together, they could buoy one another\u0027s spirits. \"I suppose we should talk about...you know,\" Denise said reluctantly, cradling her coffee mug with both hands. \"I suppose,\" Leanne said, although she\u0027d rather not. Still, everything that had happened was directly connected to Denise. The two women had never discussed it, and Leanne didn\u0027t see how talking about it now would serve any useful purpose, but she couldn\u0027t refuse. Denise squirmed in her chair, not meeting Leanne\u0027s eyes. After several uncomfortable seconds, she blurted out, \"I didn\u0027t know what Mark had done!\" \"I realize that,\" Leanne assured her calmly. \"I knew if I didn\u0027t get away, Darrin would do something terrible, that he\u0027d hurt us. He...he had before. No one knew besides Mark. I couldn\u0027t tell Mom and Dad, couldn\u0027t ask them for help. I had nowhere else to turn. My parents had pleaded with me not to marry Darrin and they were right.\" Leanne saw that Denise\u0027s hands were clenched and her knuckles had gone white. \"I\u0027ve wanted to kick myself a thousand times for my rebellious attitude. I thought they were just being overprotective. Daddy disliked Darrin the moment they met.\" So had Leanne. The man was manipulative, selfabsorbed, domineering and irrational. She\u0027d only met Denise\u0027s husband once, and she\u0027d immediately assessed his personality. Mark\u0027s sister had been blinded by infatuation--or, as she\u0027d hinted, by immaturity. Mark hadn\u0027t liked Darrin any more than Leanne had, but in his unswerving loyalty to Denise he\u0027d defended her choice. \"At the time,\" Denise was saying, \"I figured no man would ever be good enough for daddy\u0027s little girl, so I ignored his advice.\" She hung her head, and her long, straight, brown hair fell forward. \"I\u0027ve paid dearly for that.\" Mark had, too, but Leanne prevented herself from saying so. The one concrete thing Denise had done to help her brother had been to plead for a lesser sentence. Because of that, Mark had gotten a year in prison instead of five. Still, the price had been far too high and, even now, Mark continued to pay. \"You have every right to be angry with me,\" Denise said. \"I am,\" Leanne told her frankly, \"but I\u0027m trying to forgive you.\" It wasn\u0027t easy, though, and Denise obviously understood that. \"I haven\u0027t forgiven myself. Trust me, if there was a way to relive the past I\u0027d do it.\" She shook her head. \"If Mark\u0027s--\" \"Don\u0027t say it,\" Leanne insisted. \"Okay,\" Denise said. \"But I believe he\u0027s alive. I can feel it--can\u0027t you?\" Unfortunately, Leanne couldn\u0027t. All she felt was terror and fear, pressing on her chest like bricks. Denise darted her a look. \"I\u0027m not sure if anyone told you, but Darrin\u0027s in prison now for assaulting a woman he dated after our divorce.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-42.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;.
