{"id":66235,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"\"Maybe, but how could I not be?\" she asked. \"He was my husband, so I was already up to my neck in it, and then to have him walk away from our marriage without a backward glance...\"\\n\\n I remembered reading about the case and of course Patrick had mentioned it, but my recollection of the facts was vague. \"Was there a trial?\"\\n\\n \"No. He accepted a plea bargain.\"\\n\\n She took a deep breath. \"Mark served a year in prison and has to make restitution. He also received a substantial fine. His mother told me he owes forty thousand dollars.\"\\n\\n While I didn\u0027t want to dwell on Mark\u0027s legal problems or his financial mess, I had to ask one last question. \"How did this ever happen?\" From what Leanne had said, Mark Lancaster was--or had been--a good, honorable man. Why had he become an embezzler? Surely there was some underlying problem--drugs, gambling, who knows what.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t find out until much later that he took the money to help his sister. I won\u0027t go into the whole story, but Denise was desperate. She thought she had the money, but it fell through at the last minute.\"\\n\\n \"He went through all this for his sister?\" I asked, a bit incredulous. I could only hope Denise appreciated what he\u0027d done, no matter how wrong and misguided it was.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re close.\"\\n\\n \"Even now?\"\\n\\n Leanne nodded. \"To be fair, Denise--well, she had no idea Mark had, um, borrowed the money. She thought he\u0027d gotten a loan and would simply be covering the interest until she could repay it. She didn\u0027t know what this so-called loan had cost him until it was too late. She did plead for leniency before the judge and is doing what she can to pay back the money.\"\\n\\n I noticed she hadn\u0027t touched her chowder since the first spoonful. I continued eating, but at a slow pace.\\n\\n \"Have you had any contact with him since he got out of prison?\" I asked.\\n\\n I could see her struggle to hide her feelings. \"Not really,\" she said in a low voice.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure what that meant, but had the distinct impression she didn\u0027t want to talk about it. That was fine. I wouldn\u0027t press her to tell me anything she found distressing.\\n\\n \"He says he wants nothing more to do with me. According to him, I should get on with my life.\" She bit her lip. \"I saw a counselor for a while. She said essentially the same thing.\"\\n\\n \"Have you?\" I asked. I remembered how Leanne and I had talked about this--the way we disliked that kind of advice; I figured I was the only one who could decide when and how to \"move on.\" And yet...Hannah herself was, in effect, saying it, too.\\n\\n \"I made one other attempt to date. Besides tonight,\" she clarified.\\n\\n \"How did that go?\"\\n\\n She grinned. \"Awful.\"\\n\\n \"Is tonight starting off any better?\"\\n\\n Again she smiled, and the worry lines between her eyebrows relaxed. \"Much better.\"\\n\\n That was comforting. I smiled back.\\n\\n \"What about you?\"\\n\\n \"Me?\"\\n\\n \"Have you tried to socialize again since you lost Hannah?\"\\n\\n Rather than explain that this was my first date with another woman since my early twenties, I shrugged. \"Some.\" I was counting the coffee with Hannah\u0027s cousin as a sort-of date.\\n\\n \"How\u0027d it go for you?\"\\n\\n I thought about my time with Winter. \"All right, I guess.\" \"Hannah was an extraordinary woman.\"\\n\\n Extraordinary didn\u0027t begin to describe my beautiful wife.\\n\\n \"At work I care for people undergoing cancer treatment and they all have different attitudes,\" Leanne said. \"Some are angry, some are defeated or resigned. Hannah was always cheerful and optimistic. She helped others see the positives instead of the negatives.\" She was silent and thoughtful for a moment. \"Even at the end, she found things to be grateful for. When she died, I can\u0027t tell you the number of people who told me what an inspiration Hannah was to them.\"\\n\\n \"She inspired me, too.\" I was a better man for having spent twelve years as her husband.\\n\\n \"I want you to know how sorry I am that I couldn\u0027t attend her funeral.\"\\n\\n I shook my head, dismissing Leanne\u0027s apology. I hardly remembered who was there and who wasn\u0027t. My own grief had been so overwhelming that such details were of little concern. The church was packed and the service was moving--that\u0027s about all I took in.\\n\\n I saw that Leanne was now eating her chowder and I was the one who\u0027d stopped.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been a difficult year for you, hasn\u0027t it?\" Leanne murmured.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been a year,\" I said in a weak attempt at a joke.\\n\\n \"Mark and I were divorced two years ago. I assumed everything would get easier.\"\\n\\n \"It hasn\u0027t?\" This wasn\u0027t a good sign.\\n\\n \"In some ways it has. When I say my name now, people don\u0027t automatically ask if I\u0027m any relation to the accountant who stole the hospital\u0027s money.\"\\n\\n \"How do you cope?\" I asked, hoping for ideas to lessen the emptiness in my own life. Or if not ideas, at least some reassurance. \"Do you miss him any less?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she said starkly. \"I miss him every single day.\"\\n\\n Although I would\u0027ve liked a more encouraging answer, I didn\u0027t really expect one. \"I miss Hannah the same way.\"\\n\\n \"A divorce is a loss of another kind,\" Leanne said, \"but it\u0027s still a loss.\"\\n\\n No argument there.\\n\\n We finished our meals and I dumped our leftovers in a nearby receptacle. I wanted to suggest we walk for a while, but wasn\u0027t sure how Leanne felt about extending our time together.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a lovely evening,\" she said, gazing out over Puget Sound. The lights on the boats, reflected in the green-blue water, seemed festive to me, even though this was an ordinary weekday evening. Or maybe not so ordinary...\\n\\n \"Would you care to walk along the waterfront?\" I asked, thinking she might not object, after all.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d love to.\"\\n\\n We strolled down the sidewalk, but neither of us seemed talkative. I pointed out a Starbucks and proposed a cup of coffee to conclude our evening. I hesitated to use the word date. This didn\u0027t feel like one.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m comfortable with you,\" I said after I\u0027d paid for our coffee and we continued down the walkway past the Seattle Aquarium.\\n\\n \"Thank you. I\u0027m comfortable with you, too.\" She looked over at me and smiled. It was a pleasant smile and I caught myself staring at her and wondering what it would be like to kiss her. I wasn\u0027t going to do it; neither of us was ready for anything physical. Still, the thought had entered my mind and I didn\u0027t feel instantly guilty. That was progress.\\n\\n When we\u0027d drunk our coffee, I escorted Leanne to the parking garage where she\u0027d left her car, despite her protests. I couldn\u0027t in all conscience let her walk into a practically deserted garage alone.\\n\\n \"Can I drive you to your car?\" she asked when we got there.\\n\\n \"No, thanks. The exercise will do me good.\"\\n\\n I took the stairs out of the garage and emerged onto the sidewalk. Since my car was ten blocks away, I started the strenuous climb up the Seattle hills.\\n\\n \"Well, what did you think?\" I asked Hannah, burying my hands in my pockets. Glancing toward the sky, I resumed my ongoing conversation with her. \"I think it went well, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n There were certain times I felt her presence and this was one of them.\\n\\n \"I hope you\u0027re pleased,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve gotten together with two of the three women on your list.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t immediately remember the name of the third woman, whom I\u0027d never met. Her cousin I knew fairly well, although we hadn\u0027t been in contact since Hannah\u0027s death. Until last week. Leanne Lancaster I\u0027d known on a casual basis, and Macy...yes, Macy Roth, that was her name. I knew absolutely nothing about her.\\n\\n \"Why Macy?\" I asked.\\n\\n Silence greeted my question.\\n\\n \"Okay, you\u0027re right, I haven\u0027t met her yet. I will.\" Although I hadn\u0027t come up with a way to do it...\\n\\n \"You have any bright ideas?\" I asked Hannah. \"You want me to meet Ms. Roth, so it would help if you had a suggestion or two on how to go about it.\"\\n\\n Still no answer. \"I am not making a cold call, so you can forget that,\" I told Hannah. I definitely wasn\u0027t phoning this woman out of the blue!\\n\\n \"If you want me to meet Macy, you\u0027ll need to show me how.\" I nodded my head decisively so Hannah would know I was serious.\\n\\n I reached the parking garage. The night-shift attendant knew me. Paul had been at the garage from the day I joined the practice. It\u0027d been a while since I\u0027d chatted with the older black man.\\n\\n \"Evening, Dr. Everett.\"\\n\\n \"Hello, Paul.\"\\n\\n \"Staying extra late tonight?\"\\n\\n \"A bit,\" I agreed. \"Good night now.\" I started to walk away.\\n\\n \"Dr. Everett,\" Paul said as I turned.\\n\\n \"Yes?\"\\n\\n He smiled and there was a note of approval in his voice. \"I hope you don\u0027t mind me saying this, but you seem better.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re healing,\" Paul said. \"When you first lost the missus, I was real worried about you. But I can see that you\u0027re looking more alive. Your step\u0027s a bit lighter.\"\\n\\n I thanked him with a smile.\\n\\n \"It really does get easier with time.\"\\n\\n \"Does it?\" I asked, not really believing that was possible.\\n\\n \"It did with me. I lost my Lucille three years ago.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Paul, I didn\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"No reason you should. I didn\u0027t let on, figured professional men and women like yourself don\u0027t want to hear about my troubles.\"\\n\\n I felt bad that he\u0027d borne this alone.\\n\\n \"Have you...remarried?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"No, but I got myself a girlfriend. We play bingo at the VFW on Saturday nights and she talked me into taking dance lessons.\" He chuckled and shook his head with its patch of unruly white hair. \"If only Lucille could see me now. She\u0027d get such a kick out of me on that dance floor.\"\\n\\n \"You ready for Dancing with the Stars?\" I joked.\\n\\n He laughed outright. \"I don\u0027t think any TV producer\u0027s going to be interested in me.\"\\n\\n I raised my hand in farewell.\\n\\n \"Nice talking to you, Dr. Everett.\"\\n\\n \"You, too, Paul,\" I said and headed in the direction of my car. I noticed I was smiling when I happened to catch my reflection in the car window.\\n\\n I glanced upward, imagining Hannah with a satisfied little smirk on her face. \"I suppose you\u0027re responsible for that conversation, too.\"\\n\\n Chapter Fourteen\\n\\n E ver since my dinner date with Leanne Lancaster, I hadn\u0027t been able to get Hannah\u0027s list out of my mind. I\u0027d entered into this scheme of hers kicking and screaming and now... Well, now I was still fighting it, but my objections weren\u0027t as loud.\\n\\n I\u0027d connected with Leanne. I wasn\u0027t romantically interested in her, but I felt that at some point I could be. I believed the same was true of her. We\u0027d put no pressure on each other. We\u0027d both suffered great loss and while that might be a fragile bond, it gave us each a reprieve from loneliness. Simply put, I enjoyed the evening with her. The hardest part about being alone is...being alone.\\n\\n Tuesday morning when I got to the office I still felt good, which I attributed to my dinner with Leanne. What had helped, too, was my chat with Paul, the parking garage attendant. That brief conversation had filled me with hope. Like me, he\u0027d lost his wife, but had been able to move forward in life. Granted, with him it\u0027d taken three years but at least he\u0027d shown me that this grief, this allconsuming pain, would abate. Leanne had reminded me that others suffered, too, that I was not unique in my pain, regardless of how it felt. Paul had assured me that, with enough time, suffering became bearable. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-17.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) \\n My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;. \\n On the anniversary of his beloved wife\u0027s death, Dr. Michael Everett receives a letter Hannah had written him. \\n In it she reminds him of her love and makes one final request.
