{"id":66232,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"\"It\u0027s been so long since I\u0027ve been on a date that I\u0027d feel like a fish out of water.\" That wasn\u0027t the most original analogy, but it got my point across.\n \"I know what you mean.\"\n I plunged in, recognizing the irony of what I was about to do. \"Do you think it\u0027d be okay if I called you sometime?\" I could hardly believe I was asking. And yet it felt...good. I wasn\u0027t ready to date and she didn\u0027t appear to be, either. Maybe if we met casually a few times it would help both of us ease back into the world of the living.\n She looked up at me and grinned. \"I think that would be a nice idea.\"\n \"I do, too.\"\n Midafternoon I headed home in a better mood than I\u0027d been in a long while. I climbed into my car and rested my hands on the steering wheel.\n \"I hope you\u0027re happy,\" I said to Hannah. \"Next time you want to arrange a meeting with a woman on your list you might be a bit more subtle.\"\n I started the car and I could swear I heard Hannah\u0027s laughter over the sound of the engine.\n Chapter Eleven\n Her brief talk with Michael Everett at the picnic had been a turning point for Leanne. She\u0027d hardly been able to sleep that night as snippets of their conversation played back in her mind. Michael was the first man who seemed to understand, and that was because he, too, was intimately aware of loss.\n Oh, the circumstances were drastically different. Mark was very much alive, whereas cancer had taken Hannah\u0027s life. But Mark had made it abundantly clear that as far as he was concerned she might as well consider him dead. Only he was alive and Leanne couldn\u0027t make herself pretend otherwise.\n Her ex-husband had embezzled twenty-five thousand dollars. As a result, Mark had spent a year in prison. Leanne still felt shocked and mortified by what he\u0027d done. When she\u0027d first learned of the discrepancy, the missing funds, she\u0027d refused to believe Mark could be responsible. It made no sense that he, a respected accountant for a long-established Seattle firm, would resort to something like this. Something so underhanded. So wrong.\n In the beginning she\u0027d defended him, put her own reputation on the line. Later she\u0027d been humiliated when, without a single word to her, Mark had stepped forward, his attorney by his side, and admitted guilt. Two years later, she still found it difficult to comprehend. Not once had he discussed the situation with her. She hadn\u0027t even realized he\u0027d hired an attorney. He wouldn\u0027t answer when she\u0027d demanded to know why he\u0027d taken the money. As his wife, his staunchest supporter, she felt she was entitled to more than his tight-lipped refusal to give even the most rudimentary explanation.\n If he was going to \"borrow\" funds, then why, oh, why did he have to take money from a charity event for the hospital where she worked? Where she was left to face everyone once the truth came out? Surely he understood how embarrassing this was for her. All Mark would say, all he\u0027d confess to, was that he\u0027d needed the money and planned to return it. He didn\u0027t tell her, his parents or anyone she knew--not even his attorney--why he\u0027d so desperately needed that amount.\n Shamed in front of her peers and shaken to her very core, Leanne felt she had no option but to file for divorce. Apparently, Mark wasn\u0027t the honorable man she\u0027d assumed. When he was presented with the divorce papers, he hadn\u0027t offered the slightest resistance. If she wanted out of the marriage, he was willing to let her go.\n When the decree arrived, he signed it, worked out a plea bargain with the prosecution and served his time, which ended up being a year.\n Her marriage in ruins, her life in shreds, Leanne had floundered. She dragged her pain and disillusionment with her from one day to the next. Thankfully, in the two years following Mark\u0027s arrest, the talk, the rumors, the unpleasantness, had mostly died down.\n She hadn\u0027t spoken to him since the divorce was final, although she\u0027d made a couple of pointless efforts to write him while he was in prison. Mark had never acknowledged her attempts to communicate or responded to her letters. All she\u0027d wanted to know was why he\u0027d taken the money.\n A short while after she\u0027d mailed the second letter, Muriel Lancaster, Mark\u0027s mother, had phoned at his request. It seemed he\u0027d asked that Leanne not write to him again. They were divorced and he suggested she move on with her life, the same as he intended to do.\n Now, however, Leanne regretted the divorce. She\u0027d filed in anger, believing it was the best thing to do under the circumstances. No matter how many times she\u0027d pleaded with him to explain, he\u0027d remained silent. Hindsight being what it was, she wished she hadn\u0027t reacted as quickly as she had. Especially in light of what she\u0027d learned since.\n Mark was close to his younger sister. Denise was in a bad marriage with an abusive husband. She\u0027d been living in California, and no one in the family was aware of how dangerous the situation was until she\u0027d tried to leave Darrin. Her husband had immediately filed for custody of the two children and Denise was forced to fight him in court. Attorneys\u0027 fees added up and the couple had to put their house on the market.\n Thankfully, Denise won full custody of the children, but she knew she\u0027d never be safe living in California where Darrin had access to her and the two little girls. With her half of the proceeds from the house, Denise would be able to pay off the attorney and start over in another state. She could make her escape, buy airline tickets and leave for a new life.\n Desperate, she\u0027d called Mark at the last moment. All she needed was twenty-five thousand dollars for less than ten hours. She\u0027d FedEx Mark a cashier\u0027s check from the sale of the house the very next day. She couldn\u0027t involve her parents, since her father had recently retired and their income had already been reduced. Denise was in a state of panic. Leanne and Mark had taken out a home-equity loan to remodel their kitchen and with the work in progress they were at their credit limit. Knowing how frantic Denise was to pay her bills and get out of California, Mark had sent her the funds from the charity drive at the hospital.\n Then the deal on Denise and Darrin\u0027s house had unexpectedly fallen through. Caught up in her own drama, Denise took the money and ran, fleeing with her children and going into hiding. With the help of a women\u0027s organization, she went underground for six months. It was only when she resurfaced that she learned what had happened to Mark. Denise had no idea Mark had \"borrowed\" the funds, no idea of the consequences he\u0027d suffered as a result. She\u0027d pleaded his case before the court and Mark\u0027s sentence had been reduced from the original five years to one.\n By the time Denise contacted Leanne and explained, it was too late. The divorce was final. The house never did sell and eventually went into foreclosure. She ended up with nothing--except guilt over what she\u0027d caused her brother.\n The only contact Leanne had with Mark\u0027s family now was through his mother, Muriel. Brian and Muriel lived in Spokane, and her former mother-in-law called Leanne periodically. The entire situation had been devastating to all of them. Brian had been an anchor, supporting both of his children, but he seemed to have a hard time forgiving Leanne for walking out on his son when Mark needed her most.\n Leanne regretted her lack of faith in her husband--and his lack of faith in her. Mark wasn\u0027t faultless in this. He should\u0027ve explained, should\u0027ve trusted her. She felt that if they\u0027d worked together, faced this as a couple, everything might have turned out differently.\n Now here she was, two years later, divorced and miserable. The house was long gone, and she was renting a high-rise apartment. Denise, on the other hand, lived in Nebraska with her kids and was working toward repaying the money, although it was nearly impossible on what she made as a waitress.\n Leanne didn\u0027t keep in touch with Denise. She couldn\u0027t help blaming her, at least a little, for the disaster that had befallen Mark, although none of it was intentional. And she suspected Denise blamed\n her for not staying with him. The conversation with Michael the day before had brought Leanne a new resolve. She woke Sunday morning knowing she had to make one last effort to sort things out with her ex-husband. The divorce had happened so fast. She wanted--no, she\n needed--to see him. Perhaps they could assess the situation and find out if their love, along with their marriage, was completely dead. If so, she\u0027d wish him well and move on. And \"moving on\" could include seeing Michael Everett.... Leanne had found out from Mark\u0027s mother that after his release from prison, he\u0027d gone to Yakima, assisting migrant workers there, helping them with government forms and immigration papers. Apparently, this was part of the community-service hours he\u0027d been ordered to serve. Muriel had reluctantly supplied his address. All she\u0027d asked was that Leanne not tell Mark how she\u0027d learned it.\n So Leanne was going to Yakima. She dressed carefully, choosing tailored pants and a silk blouse Mark had purchased for her the last Christmas they were together. She hoped it would be a reminder of happier times. He wouldn\u0027t want to see her; returning her letters and not calling or visiting since his release made it more than clear. Still, that didn\u0027t deter her.\n Despite everything, she wanted him to ask her to reconsider, to give their relationship another shot. Almost two years had passed and maybe, just maybe, they could start again. But the request had to come from him, and Leanne knew there wasn\u0027t much likelihood of that.\n He\u0027d done nothing but shove her away from the moment he\u0027d surrendered to the authorities. He\u0027d let her know, through his attorney, that he didn\u0027t want to see her at the jail or in court. Leanne had complied, out of anger and hurt feelings. Later, she decided that he\u0027d wanted to separate her from this scandal as much as he could. It was the only explanation that made sense.\n Today she was about to confront Mark for the first time since his sentencing.\n She set off, considering the sequence of events that had brought her to this point. It seemed only minutes later that she was over Snoqualmie Pass on I-90. The next two hours passed quickly as she took the exit in Ellensburg and headed toward Yakima. Before long, thirty minutes or so from where she\u0027d left I-90, she arrived at the freeway exit. The address she\u0027d put into her GPS led her to a small apartment complex in a neglected part of the city. The two-story structure was badly in need of renovation. The outside railing had once been brown, but was now rusted where the paint had peeled off. Mark\u0027s apartment was on the upper level.\n Leanne parked the car and sat inside it for several minutes, gathering her courage. Her stomach was queasy. She had to do this, she told herself. Had to know. Had to make one last effort.\n Before she lost her nerve, she slid out of the car, squared her shoulders and drew in a deep breath. As she climbed the rickety steps to the upper level, she held on to the handrail, although it was too shaky to provide much support.\n Standing outside his apartment door, she rang the bell. No response.\n Foolish though it seemed, she\u0027d never considered that Mark might not be home. Then it occurred to her that the doorbell might be defective, as everything else at this complex seemed to be. She knocked hard. If Mark was inside, he had to know there was someone at his door.\n \"Hold on.\"\n Hearing his voice after all this time startled her. He sounded angry, gruff, unlike the man she\u0027d known and loved. But after a year in prison she had to assume he was no longer the man she remembered. Tightening her jaw, she stepped back and waited. She had only a few seconds to compose herself before the door was flung open.\n Mark stood on the other side and it would\u0027ve been difficult to say who was more surprised. Her assumption was correct, at least with regard to his appearance, which was completely altered. The neat, clean-cut accountant she\u0027d married bore little resemblance to the man who faced her now. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-14.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) \n My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;. \n On the anniversary of his beloved wife\u0027s death, Dr. Michael Everett receives a letter Hannah had written him. \n In it she reminds him of her love and makes one final request.
