{"id":66219,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Chapter One I am not a sentimental guy. I\u0027ve been known to forget Mother\u0027s Day and, once, when Hannah and I were dating, I even let Valentine\u0027s go unnoticed. Fortunately she didn\u0027t take my lapse too seriously or see it as any reflection of my feelings. As for anniversaries and birthdays, I\u0027m a lost cause. In fact, I\u0027d probably overlook Christmas if it wasn\u0027t for all the hoopla. It\u0027s not that I\u0027m selfabsorbed... Well, maybe I am, but aren\u0027t we all to a certain extent? To me, paying a lot of attention to people because it\u0027s their birthday or some made-up holiday is ridiculous. When you love someone, you need to show that love each and every day. Why wait for a certain time of year to bring your wife flowers? Action really does speak louder than words, especially if it\u0027s a loving deed, something you do for no particular reason. Except that you want to. Because you care. Hannah taught me that. Hannah. A year ago today, May eighth, I lost her, my beautiful thirty-six-year-old wife. Even now, a whole year after her death, I can\u0027t think of her without my gut twisting into knots. A year. Three hundred and sixty-five lonely days and empty nights. A few days after her death, I stood over Hannah\u0027s casket and watched as it was lowered into the ground. I threw the first shovelful of dirt into her grave. I\u0027ll never forget that sound. The hollow sound of earth hitting the coffin\u0027s gleaming surface. Not an hour passes that I don\u0027t remember Hannah. Actually, that\u0027s an improvement. In those first few months, I couldn\u0027t keep her out of my head for more than a minute. Everything I saw or heard reminded me of Hannah. To simply say I loved her would diminish the depth of my feelings. In every way she completed me. Without her, my world is bleak and colorless and a thousand other adjectives that don\u0027t begin to describe the emptiness I\u0027ve felt since she\u0027s been gone. I talk to her constantly. I suppose I shouldn\u0027t tell people that. We\u0027ve had this ongoing one-sided conversation from the moment she smiled up at me one last time and surrendered her spirit to God. So, here I am a year later, pretending to enjoy the Seattle Mariners\u0027 baseball game when all I can think about is my wife. My one-year-dead wife. Ritchie, Hannah\u0027s brother and my best friend, invited me to share box seats for this game. I\u0027m not fooled. I\u0027m well aware that my brother-in-law didn\u0027t include me out of some mistaken belief that I\u0027m an inveterate baseball fan. He knows exactly what anniversary this is. I might not be sentimental, but this is one day I can\u0027t forget. As a physician, a pediatrician, I\u0027m familiar with death. I\u0027ve witnessed it far too often and it\u0027s never easy, especially with children. Even when the end is peaceful and serene as it was with Hannah, I feel I\u0027ve been cheated, that I\u0027ve lost. As a teenager I was involved in sports. I played football in the fall, basketball in winter and baseball in the spring, and worked as a lifeguard during the summers. The competitive spirit is a natural part of who I am. I don\u0027t like to lose, and death, my adversary, doesn\u0027t play fair. Death took Hannah from me, from all of us, too early. She was the most vibrant, joyful, loving woman I have ever known. I\u0027ve been floundering ever since. Although I\u0027ve fought death, my enemy, from the day I became a doctor--it\u0027s why I became a doctor--I learned to understand it in a different, more complex way. I learned death can be a friend even while it\u0027s the enemy. As she lay dying, Hannah, who loved me so completely and knew me so well, showed me that ultimate truth. A year\u0027s time has given me the perspective to realize I did my wife a disservice. My biggest regret is that I refused to accept the fact that she was dying. As a result I held on to her far longer than I should have. I refused to relinquish her when she was ready to leave me. Selfishly, I couldn\u0027t bear to let her go. Even when she\u0027d drifted into unconsciousness I sat by her bedside night and day, unable to believe that there wouldn\u0027t be a miracle. It\u0027s stupid; as a medical professional I certainly know better. Yet I clung to her. Now I realize that my stubbornness, my unwillingness to release her to God, held back her spirit. Tied her to earth. To me. When I recognized the futility of it all, when I saw what I was doing to Hannah\u0027s parents and to Ritchie, I knew I had to let her go. I left Hannah\u0027s room and got hold of myself. I hadn\u0027t slept in days, hadn\u0027t eaten. Nor had I shaved, which means I probably looked even more pathetic than I felt. I went back to our home, showered, forced down a bowl of soup and slept for three uninterrupted hours. When I returned, the immediate family had gathered around her bedside. Hannah\u0027s heart rate had slowed and it was only a matter of minutes. Then, just before she died, she opened her eyes, looked directly at me and smiled. I held her hand and raised it to my lips as she closed her eyes and was...gone. That last smile will stay with me forever. Every night as I press my head against the pillow, the final image in my mind is Hannah\u0027s farewell smile. \"Hey, Michael. A beer?\" Ritchie asked. He doesn\u0027t call me Mike; no one does. Even as a kid, I was never a Mike. \"Sure.\" My concentration wasn\u0027t on the game or on much of anything, really. Without glancing at the scoreboard I couldn\u0027t have told you who was ahead. I went through the motions, jumped to my feet whenever Ritchie did. I shouted and made noise along with the rest of the crowd, but I didn\u0027t care about the game. I hadn\u0027t cared about anything for a long time--except my work. That had become my salvation. \"How about dinner after the game?\" Ritchie asked as he handed me a cold beer a few minutes later. I hesitated. All that awaited me was an empty house and my memories of Hannah. \"Sure.\" I didn\u0027t have much of an appetite, though. I rarely did these days. \"Great.\" He took a long swig of beer and turned back to the field. I hadn\u0027t done my brother-in-law any favors by agreeing to attend this game. These weren\u0027t cheap seats, either. Ritchie had paid big bucks for box seats behind home plate, and I\u0027d basically ignored the entire game. I should\u0027ve made an excuse and let him take someone else. But I didn\u0027t want to be alone. Not today. Every other day of the year I was perfectly content with my own company. But not today. The game must have been over because, almost before I was aware of it, people were leaving. \"Great game,\" I said, making the effort. \"We lost,\" Ritchie muttered. I hadn\u0027t been paying enough attention to notice. Ritchie slapped me on the back and headed out of the stadium. That was his way of telling me he understood. Half an hour later we sat in a friendly sports bar not far from Safeco Field. I stared at the menu, wishing I could conjure up an appetite. Over the past year I\u0027d lost nearly twenty pounds. Food was a necessity, and that was the only reason I bothered. I usually ate on the run, without interest or forethought. I needed something in my belly so I grabbed a protein bar or a vegetable drink. It served the purpose, although I derived no pleasure from it. Hannah had been exceptionally talented in the kitchen, just like her cousin Winter Adams, who owned the French Cafe on Blossom Street. She loved experimenting with recipes and took pride in preparing meals. Hannah\u0027s dinner parties were legendary among our friends. As a hostess, she was a natural--charming and gracious. \"What are you thinking about?\" Ritchie asked. His question startled me until I saw that he was gazing at the menu. \"Grilled salmon,\" I replied. \"I\u0027m leaning toward the T-bone,\" he said. I\u0027ve always associated steaks with celebration, and this wasn\u0027t a day I\u0027d consider celebrating. Long before I was willing to accept that Hannah had lost her battle with cancer, she\u0027d told me that when she was gone, she didn\u0027t want me to grieve. She said her wake should be as much fun as her parties. At the time I didn\u0027t want to hear her talk about death. By then she\u0027d resigned herself to the outcome; I hadn\u0027t found the courage to do so. The waitress took our order, brought us each a beer and left. I held the amber bottle between my fingers and frowned at the table. I wished I was better company for Ritchie. \"It\u0027s been a year,\" my brother-in-law murmured. I nodded, acknowledging the comment, but not elaborating on it. \"I miss her.\" Again I nodded. As painful as it was to talk about Hannah, I had the burning desire to do exactly that. I wanted--no, needed--to hold on to her, if not physically, then emotionally. \"Hard to believe it\u0027s been twelve months.\" I heard the pain in my own voice but didn\u0027t try to hide it. \"You doing okay?\" Ritchie asked. I shrugged rather than tell the truth--I wasn\u0027t okay. I was damn mad. Still. How dared this happen to a woman as wonderful as Hannah. How dared it happen to me! Hannah and I were married as soon as I graduated from medical school. We decided that my internship and residency would be too demanding to allow us to start a family right away. Hannah worked for a regional department-store chain as a buyer and loved her job. When I\u0027d get home too exhausted to think, she\u0027d entertain me with stories of the people she\u0027d met. People whose names I soon forgot but whose foibles lived on. The smallest incident became a full-fledged anecdote, complete with wickedly funny observations. She had a way of making the most mundane details fascinating. If I close my eyes I can still hear her laugh. I can smile just recalling the early years of our marriage and the struggles we endured, the things we enjoyed. Memories sustained me that first year without Hannah. The day I finished my residency and specialized training and was able to join a Seattle practice was the day Hannah threw away her birth control pills. We talked endlessly about our family. I love children and so did Hannah. She wanted three kids; I would\u0027ve been satisfied with two. Hannah felt an odd number would be best, so I said yes to three. But Hannah didn\u0027t get pregnant. We\u0027d assumed it would be so easy. She worried constantly, and I was convinced the stress she felt was the real problem. After eighteen months she wanted to see a fertility specialist and I agreed. That was when we learned that getting Hannah pregnant was the very least of our concerns. Within a week of our first visit to the specialist, Hannah was diagnosed with stage-four ovarian cancer. By the time the discovery was made, it was too late to save her. I couldn\u0027t help feeling I should have known, should have suspected that something wasn\u0027t right. As a medical professional, I blamed myself for the fact that Hannah went undiagnosed as long as she did. If I\u0027d paid closer attention, I told myself, I might have picked up on the clues. I\u0027d been busy, preoccupied with work. I had other things on my mind. Friends have argued with me, friends like Patrick O\u0027Malley, who\u0027s another pediatrician and one of my partners. They frequently reminded me--as did Hannah herself--that ovarian cancer is notoriously lacking in symptoms until it\u0027s too late. I knew all that. What I realized was that I needed to feel guilty, to punish myself; I think I felt better if I could blame myself for not noticing. \"Remember the night Steph and I had you and Hannah over for dinner?\" Ritchie asked, breaking into my thoughts. \"The last night?\" I nodded. It\u0027d been a Friday evening, the final time we\u0027d gone out as a couple. We\u0027d received news that afternoon that had rocked our world. The latest test results had come in--and they showed that the chemo had done little to slow the progression of the disease. Devastated, I\u0027d wanted to cancel dinner, but Hannah insisted we go. She\u0027d put on a bright smile and walked into her brother and sister-in-law\u0027s home as though nothing was wrong. I was an emotional mess and barely made it through the evening. Not Hannah. If I hadn\u0027t known, I would never have guessed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-1.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;.
