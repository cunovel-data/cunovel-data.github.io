{"id":66237,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"\"I\u0027d like to see it.\" \"I\u0027d like to show it to you.\" I directed her to the area behind the receptionist\u0027s desk. A series of five doors off the long hallway. One opened into my office and the other four led to exam rooms for patients. There was an alcove on the opposite side for Linda. \"Did you have anything in mind?\" she asked. \"Not really. What I\u0027d like is a scene that would create a sense of comfort. The children I see are sick, and some of them are afraid they\u0027ll need a shot or that someone\u0027s going to poke a needle in them and draw blood. I want to convey that the doctor\u0027s office isn\u0027t a scary place.\" Macy frowned. \"It was for me.\" I frowned in return. \"Then make sure this one isn\u0027t.\" She hesitated, and I could see she disliked me as much as I did her. Then she smiled. \"I\u0027ll sketch a concept and bring it in for your approval,\" she said pleasantly. \"When can I expect that?\" She shrugged. \"It shouldn\u0027t take more than a couple of days.\" I questioned that, considering her attitude toward punctuality. \"And your fee is?\" I asked. She glanced down the hallway and I could almost see the wheels turning in her brain. When people know I\u0027m a physician, they usually jack up the price. If she attempted to gouge me, I wouldn\u0027t tolerate it. Linda had given me the amount charged by the artist Patrick had employed, so I had a rate to compare Macy\u0027s to. \"I can see this running about seven hundred dollars.\" She looked at me assessingly. \"That\u0027s half of what I normally charge--but I need a favor.\" \"What kind of favor?\" I immediately asked. \"A small one. I\u0027ll tell you once we\u0027ve agreed on a scene. Okay?\" I nodded, just so we could move this process along. I could always decline and find another artist. \"Go ahead and sketch out your idea and bring it over when it\u0027s convenient,\" I said. \"Okay.\" I started out of the office, grateful this meeting was over. \"I\u0027m sorry I was late,\" she said as she began to leave. \"Apology accepted. Oh, can I see the photos you brought?\" I remembered that was why she\u0027d kept me waiting an additional thirty-five minutes. \"Yes, I almost forgot. I think Lovie might\u0027ve chewed on the corners of a couple of them, but you\u0027ll get a good idea of the work I do.\" I still didn\u0027t know who Lovie was, nor did I want to ask. She brought the photos out of her purse and handed them to me. The edges had been chewed on--and recently, I noticed, since they were moist. I shuffled through the first few and thought she did an adequate job. Her work was at least as good as that of the artist Patrick had used. \"Well?\" she said expectantly. \"You\u0027ll do. Based on the acceptability of the sketches, of course--and the terms of this so-called favor.\" Anger flashed in her eyes. \"I\u0027ll get back to you next week.\" \"Fine.\" She yanked the photos out of my hand, turned and walked out the door. For the life of me I couldn\u0027t imagine why Hannah would ever think I\u0027d be interested in someone like Macy Roth. Chapter Fifteen D r. Michael Everett was a jerk. Macy couldn\u0027t understand why a woman as kind and compassionate as Hannah would marry such a...a stuffed shirt. She left the office building and drove home, muttering under her breath. She couldn\u0027t get away from that unpleasant man fast enough. He\u0027d gotten all bent out of shape because she was a few minutes late. It wasn\u0027t like the entire world revolved around him! Back in her own neighborhood, Macy released a deep sigh and felt the tension ease from her neck and shoulders. Men like Dr. Everett were one reason she couldn\u0027t hold down a regular nine-to-five job. She\u0027d never survive in an office, because she couldn\u0027t bite her tongue; it just wasn\u0027t in her. Ten minutes with him had been a severe challenge. When she reached her front porch, Macy found Sammy curled up on the welcome mat, his chin resting on his paws. \"Did Harvey lock you out again?\" she asked. Poor Sammy didn\u0027t know where else to go. Macy had dutifully taken him to the vet for a checkup, hoping he\u0027d have a microchip; of course he didn\u0027t. The good news was that he\u0027d been neutered--one less expense for her. It also proved that once upon a time he\u0027d had a loving, or at least decent, home. She\u0027d posted Sammy\u0027s picture on every telephone pole in a mile\u0027s radius, along with her cell phone number. So far she hadn\u0027t received a single response. He was such a gentle dog and he\u0027d done wonders for Harvey, although her neighbor would never admit it. Despite his protests to the contrary, Harvey liked Sammy. He grumbled about how much the dog ate and that he brought fleas into the house, which wasn\u0027t true. Still, she saw Harvey place his hand on the dog\u0027s head and pat it. Sammy provided companionship when she wasn\u0027t around and he was a good watchdog, too. No squirrel had gotten into Harvey\u0027s backyard bird feeder since Sammy\u0027s arrival. \"Where\u0027s Harvey?\" Macy asked, bending down to stroke his fur. Sammy looked up at her with his doleful dark eyes. \"I\u0027ll bet he just forgot and locked the door,\" she reassured him. This had happened a couple of times already. When it did, Sammy wandered over to Macy\u0027s and set up residence on her porch. Unfortunately Snowball objected vigorously whenever Macy let him in the house. The cat apparently considered it his duty to maintain a dog-free zone. Sammy rose and started down the steps. He paused halfway to look over his shoulder, as though urging her to follow. \"Okay, I\u0027ll come,\" she said. Instead of heading for Harvey\u0027s front door as he usually did, Sammy led her to the backyard. Macy saw Harvey\u0027s hat first. Harvey was never outside without his hat. Immediately, she felt a jolt of alarm. Increasing her pace, she trotted anxiously into his yard, clambering none too gracefully over the low picket fence. \"I should charge you with trespassing,\" Harvey mumbled. Macy whirled around to find him sitting on a lawn chair. From his position she was sure he\u0027d collapsed into it. The fact that he was in the chair without his hat told her he\u0027d been too weak to retrieve it. \"Harvey,\" she cried, kneeling down in front of him, giving him his hat. \"What happened?\" \"Nothing.\" He was deathly pale and seemed to have trouble breathing. Macy didn\u0027t know what to do. \"I\u0027m calling 9-1-1.\" She heard the panic in her voice despite her efforts to remain calm. \"Don\u0027t,\" he said, his breathing labored. He pressed one hand over his heart and held her forearm with the other. \"Harvey! Something\u0027s wrong with you.\" \"Is not,\" he argued. \"Now leave me alone.\" \"I am not leaving you.\" \"Scat, girl. Get off my property.\" \"If I do that, then I\u0027m calling emergency services.\" Harvey managed a grin. \"You\u0027re an evil woman.\" \"Uh-huh.\" Macy sat cross-legged on the lawn. She pulled up a blade of grass as if she felt carefree and relaxed when her heart was actually beating at an alarming rate. \"I\u0027m staying here until I\u0027m convinced you\u0027re all right.\" Harvey muttered under his breath. Sammy lay down next to Macy and focused his gaze on the old man. She could tell he was worried, too. \"I just met the most unpleasant person,\" Macy said, figuring that if she could distract Harvey he might agree to let her call for help. \"Anyone I know?\" \"I doubt it.\" She made a face. \"He got all nasty because I was a few minutes late.\" Harvey grinned. \"You\u0027re always late.\" That was a gross overstatement. \"Not true! I try to be on time.\" And she did. But the world seemed to conspire against her. Invariably something would delay her. Like today-- She couldn\u0027t leave the house while Lovie was crying. Besides, that man had asked to see pictures of her work. Then he had the audacity to complain because she\u0027d taken the time to comply. Despite her efforts, she\u0027d been cursed with this proclivity for being late. If it wasn\u0027t one reason, it was another: a missing cat, an unexpected delivery, a desperate phone call from a friend. The timing was uncanny. \"He\u0027s such a pompous jerk.\" \"Who?\" \"This doctor I met,\" she said, wondering why he still lingered in her mind. \"What kind of doctor is he?\" \"A pediatrician who believes he\u0027s the center of the universe. He had a really wonderful wife, too.\" \"Had?\" \"She died.\" Macy grew quiet. \"I liked her so much. She had the most gentle, loving spirit.\" Harvey snickered. \"Oh, come on, Harvey, haven\u0027t you ever met someone who\u0027s truly good? Someone you feel an instant camaraderie with?\" \"No.\" \"Not even me?\" she teased. Harvey snickered again. \"Hardly. You\u0027re lucky I put up with you.\" \"Am I really that difficult?\" Okay, so she wasn\u0027t everyone\u0027s idea of the perfect neighbor--or girlfriend or employee. Macy tried to conform whenever possible, but she wasn\u0027t too successful at taking directions from others. She needed her freedom, always had. Her Grandma Lotty had called her a free spirit, but unfortunately, even free spirits needed money, which meant Macy had to work. Her problem, aside from a resistance to following orders, was the fact that she got bored if she had to do one thing for any length of time. Painting murals, for instance. She\u0027d tackle a project and would work on it intensively for a week. Once she was finished, she was finished; she never wanted to see that painting again. She\u0027d be physically exhausted and mentally depleted. Two or three days would pass before she found the energy to accept another assignment. It was the same with knitting. She probably had a dozen half-completed projects lying around. The vest for Harvey was the current one, and she was determined to get it done by the fall. She needed variety. \"This doctor upset you, didn\u0027t he?\" Macy nodded. \"He was a major disappointment.\" She\u0027d expected more of the man Hannah had married. He must have some redeeming quality, although it hadn\u0027t been apparent in their initial meeting. \"Don\u0027t do it,\" Harvey advised. That had been her first inclination, too. \"You mean you think I shouldn\u0027t paint the mural?\" \"You don\u0027t like him?\" \"Well...I suspect it was more of a case of him not liking me.\" Harvey shook his head. \"That I can understand.\" \"Harvey!\" She slapped his arm. He was feeling better, she could tell; still, she wasn\u0027t prepared to leave until she was sure he\u0027d completely recovered. They\u0027d happened before, these spells of his. She thought it might be his heart, but there was no real way of knowing unless Harvey underwent a physical exam. And Harvey, being Harvey, was dead set against stepping foot inside a medical office. No amount of wheedling would convince him to make an appointment. \"Tell the doctor you\u0027re not interested in the job,\" Harvey said again. \"I need the money.\" \"What for?\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t know,\" she said playfully, raising her arms in a shrug. \"It\u0027s just that I\u0027ve grown accustomed to certain luxuries--like eating regular meals.\" She\u0027d like to see Harvey placate three hungry cats without any cat food on hand. That was one lesson she\u0027d learned the hard way. Her cats had not been fooled nor were they amused when she\u0027d served them Cheerios for breakfast. Okay, fine, that had only happened once, but they\u0027d made their disgust quite plain. At least they\u0027d lapped up the milk.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-19.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;.
