{"id":66227,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"One night at the waterfront restaurant, he and Winter had sat and talked for hours after closing. Talked and kissed... Winter had shared her dream of starting her own restaurant. Pierre had encouraged her. He\u0027d helped her with the business plan and filling out the loan documents. After weeks of working on the project, they\u0027d been practically inseparable. While they were waiting to hear from the bank, Pierre had taken her to France for what he called a \"culinary vacation,\" which included meeting his family, who\u0027d charmed her completely. Although her French was terrible, she felt welcomed and loved. Thankfully they all spoke excellent English. She\u0027d had one spectacular meal after another, some in bistros and restaurants, others prepared by his parents. When Winter announced that she was naming her new venture the French Cafe in honor of Pierre and his family, he\u0027d let her know how pleased he was. Then for reasons she never quite understood and couldn\u0027t seem to change, their relationship had gone steadily downhill. They lived together briefly, but it just didn\u0027t work. Her schedule often conflicted with his. Some days she\u0027d go home after a long shift at the cafe and make his dinner. But Pierre showed little or no appreciation for her efforts, which annoyed her. She\u0027d sulk or make some derogatory comment, and he\u0027d react swiftly with one of his own. Other times she\u0027d talk about her day and Pierre would be so fixated on some incident or other in his own kitchen that he couldn\u0027t or wouldn\u0027t listen. Soon they\u0027d be bickering, furious with each other, finding fault. Then it\u0027d all blown up and they\u0027d separated. A year and three months had passed before they met again and admitted they\u0027d both been wrong. They\u0027d each had an opportunity to examine their roles in the breakup. Yet here it was, happening all over again. The problem was that they were too much alike--both perfectionists, both volatile. Sooner or later, usually sooner, a clash was inevitable. A few months after they reunited they\u0027d slipped back into the old patterns. Nothing had changed, despite their determination to make the relationship work. This time Winter had been the one to suggest they separate and Pierre had been all too eager to comply. Watching him walk away had nearly broken her heart. She couldn\u0027t believe that two people who\u0027d been so enraptured with each other could let it all fall apart. They both hoped that during this separation they\u0027d be able to figure out a way to fix what was wrong. At the beginning of this second breakup, not having Pierre in her life had been a relief. The sudden lack of tension had lifted a gigantic weight from her shoulders. It felt good to get home at the end of the day and not worry about doing or saying something that would set him off. She could relax, listen to the music she enjoyed, watch her favorite TV programs without having to defend her choices. She cooked what she wanted to eat without being subjected to his complaints. The honeymoon period without Pierre had carried her for nearly two weeks. Only in the past few days had Winter realized how empty her life was without him. She\u0027d heard that he\u0027d changed jobs and wondered if some of their problems might have been related to the stress he was under as head chef at the seafood restaurant. She\u0027d learned from a mutual acquaintance that Pierre had taken over as executive chef for the Hilton Hotel. The position entailed far greater responsibility, with a large staff, huge banquet facilities and less creative freedom. The trade-off must\u0027ve been worth it if Pierre was willing to make such a drastic move. It hurt that he hadn\u0027t talked to her about his decision. Still, she reminded herself, that was their agreement. No contact. When Winter had suggested the terms of their pact, she\u0027d fully expected Pierre to break it. He broke every other one they\u0027d made. Oh, that wasn\u0027t totally fair. When they\u0027d shared a place, he did occasionally prepare dinner, but not on a reliable basis. Often he\u0027d be too tired or he\u0027d simply forget, so she did most of the cooking. Even when she left a notation on the calendar it hadn\u0027t helped. And he hadn\u0027t exactly done his allotment of household tasks, either. If Pierre couldn\u0027t manage to pick up his dirty socks, she wondered how he\u0027d ever deal with being a husband and eventually a father. Despite their agreement, it bothered her that he hadn\u0027t made a single effort to contact her. She hadn\u0027t tried to reach him, either, but that was because he\u0027d always been the one to make the first move, the one who sought peace after their quarrels. So, admit it or not, she\u0027d expected to hear from him. Pierre\u0027s temper flared hot and erupted like a volcano, and when he was finished it was over. He was ready to kiss and make up. Not so with Winter. She blew like a factory whistle, and when she finished, it wasn\u0027t over. She wanted Pierre to react, to change, to learn and grow. Instead, he just walked away until she became what he called \"reasonable\" again. He\u0027d make overtures to see if that \"reasonable\" state had been achieved and when he decided it was safe, he\u0027d act as if nothing had happened. Until the next time... Now something unforeseen had turned up and she wasn\u0027t sure how to handle it. Michael had come to visit and he\u0027d made it plain that he was interested in her. At least that was what she\u0027d assumed. While setting their rules, neither Pierre nor Winter had provided for such a contingency. The question remained. Did she want to go out with her cousin\u0027s husband? Winter still didn\u0027t know. By midafternoon, she\u0027d talked herself into breaking the agreement with Pierre and seeking him out. She had a valid excuse. While she wasn\u0027t eager to acknowledge it, her real reason was that she was starved for the sight of him. These past few weeks had been a revelation. She missed Pierre. She loved him and, in the weeks apart, that hadn\u0027t changed. Closing her eyes, she heard the lilt of his accent and her heartbeat accelerated at the memory. She missed his touch, his whisper when he woke early in the morning and kissed her. In a crazy kind of way, she even missed the excitement, if that was the appropriate word, of their quarrels. What it came down to was that nothing seemed right without him. Now Michael had offered her the perfect excuse to see Pierre. Her pride would stay intact and she could present Pierre with this new situation and gauge his feelings. If he truly loved her, he\u0027d move heaven and earth to join her in solving their problems. The possibility of another man\u0027s interest should galvanize him into declaring his own. Her goal wasn\u0027t to make him jealous, but to get him to recognize his feelings. The more she thought about it, the more hopeful Winter became. Sitting at her desk, she called his cell phone, let it ring once, then abruptly disconnected. She wanted to do more than speak to Pierre. She wanted--needed--to see him. One look would tell her if he missed her half as much as she missed him. Decision made, Winter waited until later that afternoon, in the lull between lunch and dinner. She contacted the Hilton and confirmed that Pierre was indeed working that day. She pictured walking into the kitchen, pictured Pierre raising his head, meeting her eyes. He\u0027d stop whatever he was doing and come toward her as though drawn by an invisible rope. Then she\u0027d rush into his arms and he\u0027d tell her how unhappy he\u0027d been without her. Figuring she had time, Winter went shopping at a fancy little boutique off Blossom Street owned by Barbie Foster, whom she\u0027d met through Anne Marie Roche. Anne Marie had the bookstore diagonally across from the cafe and was also a friend of Alix\u0027s. On a whim she purchased a new outfit. The classic \"little black dress.\" Elegant yet sexy, it was ultraexpensive and worth every penny because of the way it made her feel. She was going to give Pierre an eyeful of what he was missing, just in case he\u0027d forgotten. When she\u0027d changed clothes, she took a cab to the Hilton. She announced herself to one of the dining-room staff. \"I\u0027m Winter Adams, a friend of Pierre Dubois,\" she explained. \"If you tell him I\u0027m here, I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll see me.\" She wasn\u0027t left to wait more than a few minutes. In that time she reviewed what she wanted to say. The staff member returned, smiling, and said, \"Chef Dubois will see you in his office.\" \"Thank you.\" Winter followed the other woman into the kitchen. Its size made her own small cafe look insignificant by comparison. Winter lost count of how many people she saw working at various stations. Everyone was busy with meal preparation. One thing was obvious; Pierre had his hands full. If nothing else, this experience would teach him some organizational skills, which in her opinion were sadly lacking. It took about two seconds to realize that her assumptions about her reception--and his improved organization--were off base. His desk was in a state of chaos. He stood when she entered the room, but he didn\u0027t advance toward her. Worse, he showed no signs of being happy to see her. He wore his chef \u0027s toque and white uniform and appeared all business. Nothing in his expression revealed any curiosity about her visit after all these weeks. Winter blinked. \"Hello, Pierre,\" she said softly, letting her voice betray her feelings. He ignored her greeting and gestured for her to sit down, then seemed to notice that the chair was stacked with papers, catalogs and menus. He scooped up the whole pile and set it on the corner of his desk, where it promptly slid off and tumbled to the floor. Winter bent down to help him retrieve the assorted pieces of paper. \"Leave it,\" he snapped. He hated it when she felt the need to tidy up a room. Swallowing, she straightened, then sat in the chair while Pierre dealt with the fallen papers. He didn\u0027t say anything the entire time he was reassembling the stack. Neither did she. When he\u0027d finished, Pierre threw himself into his own chair. The room wasn\u0027t big, but it was much more spacious than her tiny office at the cafe. \"How are you?\" she asked with a small, tentative smile. \"Busy.\" In other words, he was telling her to get to the point and be on her way. \"I hadn\u0027t heard from you,\" she said, hoping the comment sounded casual and carefree. \"We agreed there\u0027d be no contact. It was your suggestion, as I recall.\" \"We did say that,\" she said, nodding. If he wanted this to be strictly business, fine. \"So you understand I wouldn\u0027t be here now if it wasn\u0027t important.\" His gaze narrowed. \"Are you pregnant?\" She stared, hardly able to believe what he\u0027d said. \"You know better than to ask such a thing.\" \"Do I?\" \"Yes,\" she flared. She was the responsible one. After the first week, it became abundantly clear that she\u0027d have to be in charge of birth control. As a matter of fact, she\u0027d continued with the pill, which was ridiculous since they hadn\u0027t even touched in weeks. \"If you aren\u0027t pregnant, what\u0027s so important that you have to interrupt me in the middle of the day--on a Saturday, no less?\" Winter hadn\u0027t stopped to consider that he might have two or three different banquets scheduled during a weekend. Nonetheless, she forged ahead. \"An interesting situation has come up that I felt I should discuss with you.\" \"By all means,\" he murmured with more than a hint of sarcasm. \"My cousin Hannah\u0027s husband--\" \"Your cousin who died?\" \"Yes. Hannah\u0027s husband\u0027s name is Michael. He came to see me.\" \"And?\" Pierre prompted, obviously in a hurry to be rid of her. \"He wants to go out with me.\" There, she\u0027d said it. If she was looking for a reaction from Pierre, she didn\u0027t get one; his expression didn\u0027t so much as flicker. It was as if she\u0027d pointed out that this spring was cooler than normal for the Pacific Northwest.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-9.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;.
