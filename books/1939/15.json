His eyes were sunken and his expression was that of a man without hope.\\n\\n For an instant, the tiniest moment, she was sure his gaze softened as he recognized her.\\n\\n \"Leanne.\" Her name was more breath than sound. He recovered from his shock, and his eyes hardened. \"What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n She disregarded the lack of welcome. \"I\u0027d like to talk, if that would be possible?\" Right away she realized she shouldn\u0027t have added the last part.\\n\\n \"Everything that needed to be said was said a long time ago.\"\\n\\n Leanne refused to be so easily dissuaded. \"Could I come inside?\"\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027m not receiving company.\" His voice was brusque. Sarcastic.\\n\\n \"Oh.\"\\n\\n Mark stared at her. \"Why are you here?\"\\n\\n At one time he\u0027d been gentle, but it seemed that every bit of tenderness he possessed had been ground out of him. He held himself stiffly on the other side of the threshold.\\n\\n \"We never talked about...any of this.\"\\n\\n \"No need. It\u0027s too late now. We\u0027re divorced. Our marriage is over and the sooner you realize that, the better.\"\\n\\n \"You should\u0027ve told me.\" This was an old argument and one he obviously didn\u0027t want to hear. She\u0027d begged him incessantly to explain, back when he was out on bail awaiting his hearing.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want you here,\" he said. He looked around, then briefly closed his eyes. \"You don\u0027t belong in this place. Just leave--and don\u0027t come back.\"\\n\\n Her throat had closed up so tightly it was impossible to speak. Although he was outwardly angry, Leanne had to believe their love wasn\u0027t entirely dead. At the very least, she had to give it every chance to resuscitate itself, even if their relationship changed in the process, as it inevitably would.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s too late. We can talk, work this out, the way we should have in the beginning,\" she said urgently. Perhaps if she was willing to share her own regrets, Mark would acknowledge the role he\u0027d played in all this.\\n\\n \"You did us both a favor,\" he said, backing away from her. \"You weren\u0027t the only one who wanted out of the marriage.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t believe that.\" It was a lie, and she refused to accept it.\\n\\n \"Believe whatever you like,\" he said coldly. He betrayed himself, however, when his eyes couldn\u0027t seem to meet hers.\\n\\n For a few seconds, she thought she sensed a yielding in him. But if that was the case, it had been all too fleeting.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you get it?\" he said, his voice low. \"Do you honestly think it was just the money?\"\\n\\n She blinked in confusion.\\n\\n He took a step backward. She advanced, unwilling to let him escape. If he had something else to tell her, something that had never come up before, she was going to insist on hearing it.\\n\\n \"What are you saying?\" She hated the way her voice quavered.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t want to know.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re wrong.\"\\n\\n \"Fine.\" He paused. \"Frankly, I\u0027d hoped to spare you this.\"\\n\\n She reached out and grabbed the doorknob, instinctively knowing she\u0027d need its support.\\n\\n \"Did you ever wonder why I didn\u0027t fight the divorce? I figured it was for the best for more reasons than you realize. There were other women, Leanne.\"\\n\\n She felt the color drain from her face. It would\u0027ve hurt less had he thrust a knife in her abdomen. Then she frowned, suddenly sure of one thing. His words were nothing but a ploy, a trick to convince her to forget him. \"That\u0027s a lie.\" Another lie.\\n\\n He hung his head. \"I wish it was. Now you know. You saw me as this decent, honorable man and the truth is, it was all an act. You\u0027re better off without me.\" He looked at her. \"We aren\u0027t good for each other, Leanne.\"\\n\\n She found it difficult to breathe. \"I still don\u0027t believe you.\" He was sacrificing himself and she wouldn\u0027t allow him to do it.\\n\\n \"Like I said, believe what you want, but know this.\" He spoke slowly and distinctly. \"I don\u0027t want to see you. I don\u0027t want you here.\" He glanced over his shoulder, the gesture deliberate.\\n\\n Leanne blanched. He was signaling that there was someone inside the apartment, waiting for him. A woman. She couldn\u0027t hear anyone, but that didn\u0027t prove a thing.\\n\\n What if this wasn\u0027t a lie?\\n\\n Leanne clasped her hands, because she desperately needed to hold on to something and that something had to be herself. No one else was going to shore her up. She was on her own and had been from the moment Mark was arrested.\\n\\n \"Get on with your life,\" he added. \"I have.\"\\n\\n Leanne stiffened her spine. \"Funny you should say that.\"\\n\\n He locked eyes with her, which he\u0027d avoided doing since he\u0027d opened the door.\\n\\n \"I met someone,\" she told him.\\n\\n \"Good.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s the husband of one of my former patients. She died.... I was her nurse.\"\\n\\n He said nothing.\\n\\n \"I ran into Michael at a picnic. I\u0027ve been doing a lot of volunteer work. It keeps me occupied.\"\\n\\n He looked down at his scuffed running shoes as though bored.\\n\\n She ignored his rudeness. \"Michael was one of the other volunteers at the event.\"\\n\\n \"And this interests me why?\"\\n\\n \"We talked.\"\\n\\n \"I hope he asked you out.\" Again he gave the impression of boredom.\\n\\n \"Is that what you want, Mark?\"\\n\\n He raised his shoulder. \"Go out with the man, okay?\"\\n\\n She stared at him. He didn\u0027t mean what he\u0027d said. He couldn\u0027t. \"You\u0027ve changed,\" she whispered, trying to gauge the truth about his feelings. This was what she\u0027d feared--the man she\u0027d fallen in love with ten years earlier no longer existed. The one who stood in front of her was a stranger.\\n\\n \"Trust me, a year in prison will change any man.\"\\n\\n She swallowed hard.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to be cruel,\" he went on. \"I appreciate that it took a lot of courage for you to come here today, but it\u0027s too late. What we had is over. Just accept that.\"\\n\\n Clenching her fingers so tightly they hurt, she struggled to find the right words, but he spoke first.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t let yourself get bogged down in useless sentimentality. We aren\u0027t the same people we once were.\"\\n\\n Leanne felt more confused than ever. \"What you said earlier isn\u0027t true, is it? You were always faithful.\" She had to believe that, because the alternative was too devastating to consider.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t answer.\\n\\n As she blinked back tears, he stepped inside and quietly closed the door.\\n\\n Stunned, Leanne stood there, rooted to the spot, while she took in what had just happened. She closed her eyes and felt in the strongest possible way that Mark was on the other side of the door, his heart beating in unison with hers, crying out in pain, the same as hers.\\n\\n After several minutes, she turned away. She climbed carefully down the stairs and got into her car. She had to make several attempts before her hands stopped trembling enough to insert the key.\\n\\n She had her answer. The time had come to reconcile herself to the fact that she was divorced.\\n\\n If and when Michael Everett phoned to ask her out, she\u0027d respond with an unequivocal yes.\\n\\n Chapter Twelve\\n\\n o anything special this weekend?\" Ritchie asked as we left the gym Monday morning.\\n\\n \"DOnce again my brother-in-law seemed to have some kind of intuition about what was happening in my life, almost as if Hannah was whispering in his ear.\\n\\n \"Why do you ask?\" I probably sounded more defensive than I meant to because Ritchie turned to look at me, arching his eyebrows as though surprised by my reaction-- or overreaction.\\n\\n \"I guess that touched a nerve,\" he said with a grin. \"So tell me what\u0027s up.\"\\n\\n \"I volunteered at the hospital picnic for children with cancer on Saturday.\"\\n\\n \"You said you were going to.\"\\n\\n I inhaled and held my breath, then slowly released it. \"While I was there, I ran into Leanne Lancaster.\"\\n\\n Ritchie stared blankly at me.\\n\\n \"Leanne is one of the women on Hannah\u0027s list.\"\\n\\n In typical fashion, Ritchie started to laugh. \"I can see my sister\u0027s fingerprints all over this.\"\\n\\n The problem was, I could, too. I was convinced that Hannah had been directing my life, as well as Leanne\u0027s. Not that I approved or was even interested in her plan. Or so I immediately told myself.\\n\\n \"Did the two of you talk?\" Ritchie asked.\\n\\n It took me a moment to realize he was referring to Leanne. \"For a few minutes. She\u0027s divorced.\"\\n\\n Ritchie looked thoughtful. \"Hannah must\u0027ve known that if she put her on the list.\"\\n\\n The timing was right. Leanne had said her divorce was final nearly two years ago. That meant Leanne had been dealing with it when Hannah was undergoing chemotherapy.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s she like?\" Ritchie asked.\\n\\n \"How do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"Physically. Is she blonde, brunette? Tall or medium height?\"\\n\\n \"Something like that,\" I said, as I reviewed our time together. Brunette, but I saw no reason to tell Ritchie that. Besides, physical appearance wasn\u0027t significant; what was far more important was the emotional connection I felt with her.\\n\\n Ritchie shook his head, his expression amused. \"Are you going to call her?\"\\n\\n Actually, I hadn\u0027t decided. \"We talked about it, Leanne and I. She isn\u0027t over the divorce yet and you, better than anyone, know how raw I still feel.\"\\n\\n \"Ask her out,\" Ritchie urged. \"What can it hurt?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re two wounded people.\"\\n\\n \"See?\" he joked. \"You already have something in common.\"\\n\\n I had to admit Ritchie had a point. I grinned. \"Maybe I will.\" We reached the street, ready to part company.\\n\\n \"You have plans for next weekend?\" my brother-in-law asked.\\n\\n I mentally scanned my social calendar, which took all of two seconds. \"Not that I can remember. Why?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Max\u0027s birthday. Steph\u0027s throwing him a party. I thought you could keep me company.\"\\n\\n \"Count me in.\" I appreciated the way Ritchie and Steph included me as both family and friend.\\n\\n \"Great. I\u0027ll give you the details about Saturday when I have them. See you Wednesday morning.\"\\n\\n \"Wednesday,\" I repeated and headed for the office.\\n\\n The morning was fairly typical of any Monday in a pediatrician\u0027s clinic. The phone rang constantly and I had appointments scheduled practically on top of one another. A new influenza was going around; I saw three cases first thing. The big danger when children have the flu is dehydration, and I sent one four-year-old to the hospital.\\n\\n I stepped into my office at lunchtime and shut the door. I\u0027d ordered a Greek salad from the deli across the street and it sat on my desk. I pried open the lid and pierced some lettuce with my plastic fork. As I took my first bite, Leanne came to mind. I couldn\u0027t help wondering if she\u0027d thought about me on Sunday. She\u0027d occupied my thoughts, and I wasn\u0027t happy about it, either.\\n\\n I leaned back in my chair as I contemplated my course of action. Although I\u0027d mentioned getting in touch, I hadn\u0027t jotted down her phone number. As I\u0027d pointed out to Leanne, I was rusty when it came to this dating business, but I didn\u0027t realize how much until that moment.\\n\\n I checked the online telephone directory and found nothing listed for Leanne Lancaster or L. Lancaster. I doubted she\u0027d still have a phone listing under her husband, but it wouldn\u0027t hurt to look. Only I couldn\u0027t think of his name. Mack? Matt? It definitely began with an M--didn\u0027t it? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-15.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) \\n My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;. \\n On the anniversary of his beloved wife\u0027s death, Dr. Michael Everett receives a letter Hannah had written him. \\n In it she reminds him of her love and makes one final request.
