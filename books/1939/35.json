{"id":66253,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"She knew it. So did I. Chapter Twenty-Seven \"Have I ever asked anything of you before?\" Ritchie asked, his breath coming in gasps as he kept pace with the treadmill. Usually he had his ears plugged with his iPod, but this morning he\u0027d decided to hound me into rejoining the weekly poker match. I pretended not to hear him. \"Michael.\" He tried again. I glanced in his direction. \"To answer your question, yes, you have. In fact, you seem to constantly be asking me to do one thing or another.\" \"It\u0027s a poker game. You used to love poker.\" \"I was young and foolish.\" \"So, what changed?\" Ritchie asked, cocking one thick eyebrow. I sighed. Okay, so Ritchie wanted me to sit in for Bill, whose wife had recently given birth to twins. Bill had taken my spot in the weekly game two years earlier, and now, with the demands of a young family, he felt he needed to bow out. Ritchie was right; I really had liked my time with the guys. One night a week we set aside the concerns of our offices, our patients, taxes, malpractice insurance and everything else. One night a week we simply had fun, enjoying one another and our game of Texas Hold\u0027em. I don\u0027t mean to brag, but I\u0027m fairly good at cards. However, I cared far more about the camaraderie I had with the guys than taking their quarters. I might not be a tournament-quality player, but I could generally count on beating my friends and feeling superior for a couple of minutes. Patrick, Steve and Ritchie used to say I was lucky. I didn\u0027t feel so lucky when Hannah learned she had cancer. I quit playing after she was diagnosed. I didn\u0027t feel I could leave her for even one night. Because the cancer hadn\u0027t been detected until she was at stage four, I knew we had a struggle ahead of us. Hannah knew it, too; otherwise, she would\u0027ve protested me giving up my poker night. I\u0027m not going to say it wasn\u0027t hard to abandon the game and my time with these friends. They were my buddies, who knew me better than anyone, other than Hannah. Other than family. I wasn\u0027t sure why I hadn\u0027t gone back. Well, for one thing, Ritchie had found a replacement and it didn\u0027t seem fair to show up a year later and announce that I\u0027d returned and Bill would have to leave. On the other hand, we could\u0027ve played with five, and Ritchie had invited me more than once. I\u0027d always declined; I had no real desire to play. After a few times, Ritchie had stopped asking. Until this morning. \"Will you come?\" Ritchie pressed. \"We need you, man.\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" The same reluctance filled me, even if I couldn\u0027t explain why I was avoiding something I\u0027d once enjoyed so much. \"When will you know?\" Ritchie demanded. This sounded like a schoolyard conversation. \"Soon,\" I said. \"Call me before two--otherwise, I\u0027ll get someone else.\" Ritchie was upset, and that was rare for him. Hannah and her brother had the same easygoing disposition. My indecision irritated him and he had no qualms about letting me know that. If I could\u0027ve told him why I felt so reluctant, I would have. When I got to the office, the first thing I did was look at the mural. Macy hadn\u0027t been back since the accident, which meant she was still laid up. I\u0027d checked in with Harvey a couple of times to see how she was doing. According to her neighbor, Macy was up and about, but still sore and miserable. \"When\u0027s Macy coming in?\" Linda asked. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I snapped. Linda\u0027s eyes widened and she glared at me. \"There\u0027s no need to be rude,\" she snapped back. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" I apologized rather than allow any dissension between us. \"I haven\u0027t been in touch with Macy. When we spoke, I told her she could finish the mural as soon as she\u0027s up to it.\" \"You mean you haven\u0027t talked to her since the accident?\" \"No. Not since Saturday, anyhow.\" My source had been her cantankerous neighbor, who seemed to take great delight in my interest. \"It\u0027s already Wednesday--I expected her back by now,\" Linda murmured. She shook her head and cast me a look similar to one my mother had used when I was a kid-- the one that said she was disappointed in me. I\u0027d assumed Macy would want to finish the mural right away. I missed seeing her at the office, although I was only now admitting it. \"She\u0027ll return as soon as she\u0027s ready,\" I told Linda. \"By the way, Dr. O\u0027Malley phoned,\" Linda said. \"I left the message on your desk.\" \"Thanks.\" I entered my office, then sat down and reached for the pink slip. But it wasn\u0027t Patrick I was thinking about. Macy was front and center in my thoughts. I didn\u0027t like it, but I couldn\u0027t ignore this curiosity. Before I had time to reconsider, I grabbed the phone and called Harvey. I\u0027d already talked to him twice in the past four days, and both conversations had annoyed me. Still, that wasn\u0027t enough to dissuade me from phoning a third time. I needed to know that Macy was getting better, but I was determined not to call her. \"Yes?\" Harvey barked into the receiver. \"This is Dr. Everett.\" \"I know who it is,\" he returned in the same bad mood he usually displayed. \"I\u0027m calling to see how Macy is.\" \"Why don\u0027t you bother her instead of me? I\u0027m not her nurse.\" \"I realize that,\" I said, clenching my teeth, \"but you\u0027re her neighbor and her friend.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t be if I had a choice.\" \"How\u0027s she healing?\" He hesitated. \"Not sure.\" \"Why not?\" It sounded as if Harvey was in pain again. I wished he\u0027d let me help him, the stubborn old fool. \"It isn\u0027t like I\u0027m keeping tabs on her.\" I was beginning to feel concerned. \"You\u0027ve seen her in the past twenty-four hours, haven\u0027t you?\" \"Yeah,\" he muttered. \"How does she look?\" \"All right, I guess. Black-and-blue. She\u0027s limping a bit, but that seems to be improving. I don\u0027t understand why you keep bugging me when she\u0027s got her own phone.\" \"I figured you\u0027d be honest with me,\" I said, and while there was some truth to that, it wasn\u0027t the real reason I\u0027d called him. I knew if I spoke to Macy directly, I\u0027d find an excuse to visit--and if I went to see her, I\u0027d end up kissing her again. That was not going to happen. \"You don\u0027t want to talk to Macy because you\u0027re falling for her.\" Rather than address that comment, I chose to overlook it entirely. I wasn\u0027t arguing with Harvey. \"If Macy needs anything, let me know.\" \"She won\u0027t, and even if she did I wouldn\u0027t call you.\" The line was abruptly disconnected and I sat back in my leather chair, mulling over the conversation. I agreed with Harvey; I needed to call Macy myself, although I was reluctant to do so. My reasons were too complicated to explain to anyone else, especially a cranky old man who seemed increasingly scornful of me. My next call was to Patrick who, besides being my friend and partner, was one of the poker group. I had a patient waiting, but with Patrick I knew I\u0027d be on and off the phone in under a minute. \"I got your message,\" I said. \"You going to the game tonight?\" \"I haven\u0027t decided.\" \"What\u0027s wrong with you, Michael? Are you afraid Hannah wouldn\u0027t want you to have fun?\" \"Ah...\" The comment felt like a slug in the gut. \"I\u0027ve got to go. Listen,\" Patrick continued, \"you have to be there tonight. No excuses, understand?\" \"Okay, okay.\" The line went dead. A tingling feeling raced down my spine. Had Patrick hit on something I hadn\u0027t considered? Ritchie and Patrick were telling me essentially the same thing. It went without saying that if Hannah were alive, she\u0027d be the first one to encourage me to rejoin my friends. At noon, I told Ritchie I\u0027d be at his house by six-thirty. I could tell he was pleased. The more I thought about it, the more I looked forward to being with the guys again. It would be like old times--we\u0027d laugh, exchange stories, eat pizza and drink beer. Then we\u0027d play cards until we ran out of quarters--or I walked away, my pockets jingling with change. I showed up fifteen minutes early. \"Glad you\u0027re here,\" Ritchie said. Max came downstairs and gave me a high five before racing back up. Without asking, Ritchie handed me a beer. \"Pizza\u0027s on the way.\" \"With anchovies?\" \"Would I order one without?\" \"That\u0027s what I was hoping you\u0027d say.\" Hannah and Steph detested anchovies, and whenever the four of us ordered pizza, Ritchie and I made sure we shared one with double anchovies, just to prove that we were real men. We told little Max that the fish put hair on our chests, which was why the women refused to eat them. The joke was inane, but it always made us laugh. Patrick got there next, and when he saw me he grinned. \"About time,\" he said. Steve was the last to arrive. He pulled into the driveway and the pizza delivery kid pulled in right behind him. Five minutes later, we each had a cold beer and a slice of pizza. The stories started and before long I was laughing so hard my sides hurt. I felt almost as if I\u0027d never been away. It\u0027d been nearly two years since I\u0027d played poker. Two years. That seemed impossible now that I realized how much I\u0027d missed it. We played until eleven. Steve won, and all I could say was that I\u0027d gotten rusty and I\u0027d get my money back the following week. Just before we were ready to call it quits, Steve said, \"I brought a welcome-back gift for Michael.\" He spoke in formal tones, and everyone looked in his direction. My friend, an internal medicine specialist, was smiling from ear to ear. \"For me?\" I asked in a falsetto voice, hoping it wasn\u0027t a practical joke. \"I was at a medical conference in Miami last weekend,\" Steve said, \"and I picked these up while I was there.\" He opened a plain brown paper bag and with considerable ceremony laid out four fat cigars. \"They\u0027re Cuban,\" he said proudly. \"You sure about that?\" Patrick had always been the skeptic of the group. \"Smoke one and then you tell me,\" was Steve\u0027s comeback. \"Cuban?\" I repeated. \"Aren\u0027t they illegal?\" \"Don\u0027t ask, brother, just enjoy.\" \"Yeah, Everett, don\u0027t look a gift horse in the mouth.\" This came from Ritchie, who already had the cigar clamped between his teeth. I agreed. Who was I to question when and how Steve had procured these cigars? I bit off the end and lit up, too. The aroma from Ritchie\u0027s cigar wafted toward me. I closed my eyes as the sheer pleasure of it overtook me. \"Even if this isn\u0027t Cuban, it\u0027s still the best cigar I\u0027ve ever had,\" Ritchie said appreciatively. The four of us sat back, and although none of us smoked, once or twice a year we indulged in a cigar. Apparently, the tradition had continued without me. \"It\u0027s good to have you back,\" Steve said. He held out the cigar as if toasting me with the finest whiskey. \"Hear, hear,\" Patrick said. \"I\u0027ll second that,\" Ritchie added. I looked around the room at my friends and felt their welcome. \"It\u0027s good to be back,\" I told them and I meant it. We sat there talking for another thirty minutes and then, because we all had to be at the office or hospital early the next morning, we called it a night. On the drive home, I turned up the radio and sang golden oldies at the top of my voice. Once I got to the house, I was too keyed up and happy to sleep.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-35.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;.
