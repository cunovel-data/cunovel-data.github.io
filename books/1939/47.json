{"id":66265,"no":47,"title":"Page 47","content":"\"Does an apology help?\" she asked. \"No.\" \"Oh.\" This had gone on long enough. I walked over to the door and opened it. To my shock Linda, the receptionist and two other staff members stood on the other side, listening in on our conversation. They each wore a stunned look and instantly scattered. If I hadn\u0027t been so unprepared, I would have laughed. Well, maybe not. \"I remember Hannah,\" Macy said. My hand remained on the knob, my back to Macy. I felt a surge of anger. It wasn\u0027t fair to bring up Hannah\u0027s name! \"I think it would be best if you left now.\" But Macy didn\u0027t leave. \"I don\u0027t have a lot of friends.\" She hesitated, then amended the statement. \"That isn\u0027t what I meant--I have lots of friends, but most of them are more...acquaintances. I considered Hannah a friend, a true friend. I loved everything about her. The way she laughed wasn\u0027t like anyone else I ever knew. I enjoyed the sound of it so much I\u0027d do just about anything to hear it.\" \"It really is time for you to go,\" I said again, my voice gaining conviction. \"I know. I probably should, but I can\u0027t make myself do it.\" \"Do you want me to call security?\" \"You could, but I should remind you that Larry likes me.\" She was quickly gaining the upper hand and I resented it. I opened my mouth to tell her I\u0027d request someone else, when she interrupted me. \"No one\u0027s ever loved me the way you do...did.\" That was her reason for abandoning me? It didn\u0027t make sense. Not for a moment. \"Oh, my grandmother. And maybe Harvey, although he\u0027d never admit it.\" \"You\u0027re telling me this...why?\" \"Because your love frightened me. I didn\u0027t know what to do or how to act. It overwhelmed me, just like Hannah\u0027s friendship did.\" \"You ran away from her, too?\" \"No.\" Liar. Other than at Hannah\u0027s funeral, I\u0027d never seen Macy, never even met her. \"I don\u0027t remember you coming to visit her.\" \"I didn\u0027t,\" she confessed. That said it all. \"I couldn\u0027t bear to see her so gravely ill, not Hannah. So I sent her things.\" \"Things?\" \"I wrote her poems and mailed her letters and pictures of Snowball and Lovie. And I knit her socks. And a shawl.\" I frowned. I suddenly remembered those multicolored socks and the letters; they\u0027d made Hannah smile, when it didn\u0027t seem possible I\u0027d ever see her smile again. Without my knowing it, Macy had given me a gift I\u0027d never expected. I swallowed hard and turned to face her. \"Thank you.\" She shrugged off my appreciation. \"If you don\u0027t want to see me anymore, I\u0027ll accept that, I really will, but I\u0027m hoping you\u0027ll give me another chance.\" \"So you can walk out on me again? So you can disappear at the first sign of trouble? So you can leave one more issue in your life unresolved? No thanks, Macy. I\u0027ve learned my lesson.\" She nodded sadly. \"Thank you for loving me for that little while, Michael,\" she said. \"It means more than you\u0027ll ever realize.\" She walked past me, over to the door. Without even knowing that I intended to do it, I reached out and touched her hand. I had the sinking sensation that if I let Macy walk away from me again, I\u0027d always regret it, always wonder what we might\u0027ve had together. After a moment, she turned back to face me, her eyes alight with hope. She must have read the love in my eyes because she sobbed and then walked into my arms as if that was where she belonged, where she was meant to be. I grabbed her blouse and bunched it up in the back as I held her against me and breathed in the scent and feel of her. I closed my eyes and savored just having her in my arms. \"I need you, Macy.\" What would Hannah want? Ritchie had asked me that. Now I had an answer. Hannah had known I\u0027d fall in love with Macy. Knew she\u0027d be the perfect balance for me. Knew that Macy would teach me to laugh again. \"I need you, too,\" she whispered. We kissed then, with a hunger that threatened to consume us both. Her hands were in my hair, roving over my neck and down my back, restless in their movements. It would\u0027ve been so easy to lead her to the sofa and make love to her right there in my office. Thankfully common sense prevailed. Once I\u0027d regained control, I felt it was important to clear up a few things. \"When we\u0027re married, I\u0027m not living in that fairy-tale house. I\u0027ve got a very nice place and--\" \"Uh-uh. We can\u0027t leave Harvey,\" she said firmly. She broke away and leaned back just far enough to study me. \"I\u0027ll paint the house any color you want except white.\" \"I like white,\" I protested. \"But you\u0027re right about Harvey.\" \"Green, then.\" \"I am not living in a green house.\" \"You really should give red and yellow a chance. You\u0027d get used to it.\" \"No, I won\u0027t.\" I wanted her to understand that I had my limits. \"Okay, I\u0027ll paint it white, but I won\u0027t like it and neither will my cats. They missed you, by the way.\" \"Sure they did.\" If they missed anything it was sleeping on my chest and digging their claws into me in the middle of the night just to see how loud I\u0027d yelp. \"I want babies,\" Macy said. \"Lots of babies.\" \"We\u0027ll negotiate that.\" \"Girls first. Two, I think, and then boys.\" \"We generally don\u0027t have a say in which comes first-- boys or girls.\" \"Oh, right.\" I smiled. Hannah\u0027s list had led me here. To Macy and the life we\u0027d have together. Hannah must be looking down on us right now, laughing that delighted laugh of hers and giving us her blessing.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-47.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;.
