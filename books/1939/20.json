{"id":66238,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"\"Speaking of meals,\" she began. \"Were we?\" \"Yes, I was talking about how fond I am of little things like breakfast, lunch and dinner.\" \"Right,\" he muttered. His agreeing with her was unusual enough to get her attention. \"When\u0027s the last time you ate?\" He frowned as though deep in thought. \"A while ago.\" \"Can you be more specific?\" \"This morning.\" That might explain why Harvey appeared to be lightheaded. \"I think,\" he added. Well, no wonder, then. \"Stay put,\" she ordered as she rose to her feet. \"You talking to me or that mangy mutt?\" Macy smiled. \"Both of you. I\u0027ll be right back.\" \"Don\u0027t hurry on my account and don\u0027t be bringing me anything from your fridge. I remember the last time you decided I needed to eat.\" He cringed at the memory, and Macy rolled her eyes. \"You liked it,\" she told him. \"Until I learned I was eating health food.\" He nearly spat out the word. \"Tofu is excellent for you. And you didn\u0027t mind it when you thought it was chicken.\" She\u0027d told that little white lie for his own good. \"I had indigestion for a week.\" \"I\u0027ll bring you canned soup,\" she promised. Her cupboards were looking like Mother Hubbard\u0027s, except for a case of tomato soup she\u0027d picked up a month or so earlier. A bowl of that would be easy on Harvey\u0027s empty stomach. She\u0027d heat some up and bring it to him. \"What\u0027s it got in it?\" \"Tomatoes.\" \"How can I believe you?\" He snorted. \"You already tried to fool me once.\" \"You don\u0027t have to eat it if you don\u0027t like it,\" she told him. \"I don\u0027t like it.\" \"You haven\u0027t tasted it yet.\" \"I won\u0027t like it,\" he insisted. \"You sound like a two-year-old.\" Macy refused to argue with him any further. \"I\u0027ll be back in a jiffy.\" \"Take your time,\" Harvey said. \"In fact, take all the time you want--like a year or two.\" \"A bad mood is merely a symptom of being hungry or tired.\" \"Maybe that was your doctor\u0027s problem. Maybe he was hungry or tired.\" Macy pretended not to hear as she climbed over the fence and walked in her back door. She really should remember to lock it. Someone might actually break in one day. Not that a thief would ever find anything. Heating up the soup took only a few minutes. She carried out a bowl using both hands, with a sleeve of soda crackers tucked under her arm. Harvey\u0027s eyes were closed and his hand rested on Sammy\u0027s head. He removed it when he heard her coming. \"I was napping,\" he complained. \"You woke me up.\" \"Here.\" \"I said I don\u0027t want that.\" \"Harvey, don\u0027t make me spoon-feed you.\" He seemed to weigh his options, then sat up straighter and reached for the bowl. Macy waited until he\u0027d taken his first spoonful. His eyed widened and he looked genuinely surprised. \"This isn\u0027t bad.\" \"Told you so.\" Macy returned to the kitchen and prepared a second bowl for herself. Her cats weren\u0027t pleased to see her go, especially so soon after she\u0027d come home. They wove between her feet, purring loudly in protest. \"I\u0027ll be back in a little while,\" she said, bringing her own soup outside. She stepped over the fence again and reclaimed her place on the lawn next to Harvey. Sammy gazed at her bowl of soup and seemed to decide she could have it all to herself. Macy ruffled his ears. \"Find the owner of that dog yet?\" Harvey asked. \"Nope.\" \"He can\u0027t stay here.\" \"Okay, Harvey.\" \"I mean it this time.\" \"Of course, Harvey.\" \"Why do you agree with everything I say, especially when we both know you don\u0027t mean a word of it?\" She grinned and helped herself to a couple of crackers. \"It\u0027s just my nature, I guess.\" He ignored that and looked at her thoughtfully. His soup was only half-eaten when he set it aside. \"You figure out what you\u0027re going to do?\" he asked. \"About what?\" \"That doctor.\" \"Oh, him.\" Macy had almost managed to forget that unpleasant man and wasn\u0027t happy about the reminder. \"You didn\u0027t like him.\" \"No.\" \"Then don\u0027t work for him.\" \"You\u0027re right, I shouldn\u0027t.\" Michael Everett would probably criticize every detail of the mural. Working for him was guaranteed to be completely and totally frustrating. Macy glanced at the house and saw all three of her cats sitting on the windowsill, watching her. It was their dinnertime. She\u0027d need to buy cat food soon, since she didn\u0027t want a repeat of the Cheerios incident. Harvey had a point; she could turn down the job. But that would be foolish, especially when the first of the month was fast approaching. \"You thinking about what I said?\" Harvey asked. \"I am.\" \"What did you decide?\" She settled back on the grass, supporting her weight on the palms of her hands. \"I\u0027m thinking I\u0027ll paint that mural.\" The old man grinned as if he\u0027d known all along that was what she\u0027d do. \"But I won\u0027t like it,\" she added emphatically. Chapter Sixteen I \u0027d had an enjoyable weekend with Ritchie and Stephanie. Max had turned nine and we\u0027d celebrated his birthday long after his rambunctious friends had departed. Max requested the leftover cake and ice cream for dinner, so that was what we ate. Perhaps because the weekend had been such a highlight, my week started off well. Wednesday morning I arrived at my office after meeting my brother-in-law at the gym and was greeted with a surprise. Winter Adams was there waiting for me. Linda told me she\u0027d brought Winter to my office. \"Did I do the right thing?\" she asked uncertainly. warm smile and I saw a large plate of fresh croissants on the corner of my desk. \"It\u0027s fine,\" I assured her. Winter stood when I entered the room. She gave me a \"I know it\u0027s rude to stop by unannounced,\" Winter said, \"but I hope you don\u0027t mind.\" \"On the contrary, I\u0027m delighted.\" And I was--but I hadn\u0027t expected anything like this. Winter moved toward me and I met her halfway. I didn\u0027t plan what happened next. As she drew near I leaned forward and kissed her on the cheek. To anyone else it might seem a little thing, but to me, at this stage of grieving, it was major. I was actually comfortable kissing, albeit rather formally, another woman. I wasn\u0027t sure how to explain it, other than that it seemed appropriate. \"I hadn\u0027t heard from you,\" Winter said, \"and thought I\u0027d drop by. I hope you and your staff enjoy the croissants.\" I heard the hesitancy in her voice and realized she was uneasy about appearing forward. \"I appreciate it,\" I said. \"So will everyone else.\" \"My pleasure, really.\" She walked over to my desk and I saw she\u0027d also brought a paper bag. She took out a stack of paper plates, napkins and several small jars of jelly and foil-wrapped pats of butter. \"Thank you. This is very generous, Winter.\" She bobbed her head. \"You\u0027re welcome. I know you\u0027re busy, and I should be getting back to the cafe. My baker, Alix, is pregnant. I mentioned that before, didn\u0027t I? The entire staff watches over her. So I\u0027ve been coming in extra early and... Well, anyway, I wanted you to know I\u0027ve been thinking about you.\" She didn\u0027t look up as she spoke and I noticed that her hands trembled slightly. They made small jerky movements as she arranged everything on the desk; then she didn\u0027t seem to know what to do with them anymore and dropped them by her sides. \"Thanks again,\" I said awkwardly. \"Your nurse said you have a busy schedule this morning so I won\u0027t keep you.\" She picked up her purse, yanking the strap over her shoulder as she edged her way to the door. \"Enjoy.\" I walked with her. \"Can I call you later?\" I asked. She looked up at me as a slow smile slid into place. \"I\u0027d like that.\" She moved past me and gave my elbow a gentle squeeze as she left. For a minute, maybe longer, I stood rooted to the spot, analyzing what had just happened. I hadn\u0027t talked to Winter in more than two weeks. I was doubtful there was any chance of a romantic relationship between us. Winter and Hannah had been more than cousins, they\u0027d been good friends. I was afraid any relationship we might have would be stalled by our mutual love and admiration for Hannah. Perhaps I was wrong; however, I hadn\u0027t felt the spark of attraction that might have eventually flamed into romance, if I may be forgiven that cliche. I took the plate of croissants into the small room reserved for staff breaks. Linda found me there. \"Don\u0027t you want one?\" she asked. \"I do, but I\u0027ll have it later.\" I wasn\u0027t much of a breakfast eater and had set a croissant aside in my office. \"That was Hannah\u0027s cousin.\" \"So she said.\" I set the plate down on the countertop next to the microwave. \"It was very kind of her, don\u0027t you think?\" Linda avoided eye contact. \"What?\" When I caught her gaze, she smiled knowingly. \"Winter was being more than kind, you realize. She\u0027s interested in you.\" \"In me?\" I asked, playing dumb. I planted my hand on my chest as if I considered the idea preposterous. Linda rolled her eyes. \"She couldn\u0027t have been more blatant if she\u0027d tried--and she\u0027s trying.\" I grinned. \"Yeah, I guess she is.\" \"Are you going to ask her out?\" I hadn\u0027t gotten that far. \"I don\u0027t know. What do you think?\" I wanted a woman\u0027s take on the situation, a woman\u0027s perspective. Linda had worked for me from the time I\u0027d joined the practice and knew me well. She\u0027d given me unstinting support during Hannah\u0027s illness; as Ritchie said, she\u0027d been a rock. She was closer to my mother\u0027s age, and while I spoke to my parents in Arizona every other week, dating again wasn\u0027t a topic I\u0027d discuss with either of them. \"What do I think?\" Linda murmured. \"I\u0027m not sure. Are you attracted to Winter?\" \"I suppose I could be,\" I said, although I really wasn\u0027t convinced of it. Linda\u0027s brows gathered in a frown. \"That isn\u0027t exactly a ringing endorsement.\" \"I don\u0027t really know her well enough to have formed much of an attraction,\" I hedged. \"Okay,\" Linda said, \"how do you feel about getting to know her?\" That question was easier to answer. \"I wouldn\u0027t mind.\" And it was true. At the very least, we could resume a friendship of sorts, this time without Hannah as our go-between. \"Then do it,\" my nurse said. \"The ball is definitely in your court. The next move is up to you.\" I had the distinct feeling that if I didn\u0027t follow through after Winter had taken the initiative, I probably wouldn\u0027t hear from her again, family connection or not. I enjoyed Leanne Lancaster\u0027s company and had been giving serious thought to calling her. The reason for my hesitation was simple--I was afraid. I wasn\u0027t ready for this and neither was she. Leanne felt as emotionally raw from her divorce as I was a year after losing Hannah. The strongest link between us was pain, and that wasn\u0027t the most solid basis for any sort of lasting bond. However, I sensed that we might be able to help each other heal. There\u0027s comfort in shared misery. Together we might even find a way to move beyond the pain to a new form of happiness--or contentment at any rate.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-20.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;.
