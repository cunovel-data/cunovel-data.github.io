{"id":66223,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\"Why not?\" he barked.\\n\\n Macy had learned long ago that his gruff exterior disguised a generous, loving heart. Apparently, his mission in life was to hide it. \"I brought you dinner.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not even noon,\" he shouted.\\n\\n \"I know, but I won\u0027t be home by dinnertime,\" Macy shouted back. She made an effort to open the screen only to discover it was locked.\\n\\n \"Come on, Harvey, open the door.\"\\n\\n \"I locked it for a reason.\" Taking his time, he ambled into the living room and reluctantly unfastened the screen. He looked none too happy to see her. \"I\u0027ve got more important things to do than answer the door, you know.\"\\n\\n \"Of course you do.\" She glided past him and into the kitchen. The newspaper lay on the table, the crossword puzzle half-completed. Harvey read the paper from front to back every day.\\n\\n Macy set the casserole on the stove, then pulled off her oven mitts and set them aside.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" he asked, nodding at the casserole and grimacing with exaggerated disgust.\\n\\n \"Food.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t get smart with me, little girl.\"\\n\\n Macy grinned. \"It\u0027s a new recipe.\"\\n\\n \"So I\u0027m your guinea pig.\"\\n\\n \"In a manner of speaking.\" Harvey had lost weight in the past year. His clothes hung on him and she couldn\u0027t help worrying. At eighty-six, his age had finally begun to show. He used to work in his yard year-round and had always taken great pride in his garden and flower beds. Twice now, Macy had mowed his yard for him. If he noticed he didn\u0027t say. She had an old push mower that had been her grandmother\u0027s, and it was better exercise than working out at the gym. Less costly, too.\\n\\n Macy avoided anything that required monthly payments, other than those that were unavoidable, like water and electricity. Since she didn\u0027t have a steady job, she couldn\u0027t count on a regular income. There were a lot of months when she had to resort to digging in the bottom of her purse for lost coins.\\n\\n \"It smells good,\" Macy said, leaning over the casserole dish and giving an appreciative whiff.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s in it?\" he asked suspiciously.\\n\\n \"Meat and rice.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of meat?\"\\n\\n \"Chicken,\" she said. \"But when did you get so choosy?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got my standards,\" he insisted.\\n\\n She smiled; it was true--but those standards were starting to slip. She saw dirty dishes stacked in the kitchen sink. That wasn\u0027t so unusual at her house, but it was for Harvey. He liked organization, thrived on it, while she was most comfortable in chaos. Perhaps comfortable was putting it too strongly. Saying she was accustomed to chaos would be more accurate. One day she really did intend to put everything in order; she\u0027d have Harvey teach her.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t need you looking after me,\" he said. \"Haven\u0027t you got better things to do than feed an old man?\"\\n\\n \"Not really,\" she told him. Granted, she had to get to the studio, but Harvey was a priority. Even if her grandmother hadn\u0027t asked Macy to keep an eye on him, she would\u0027ve done it anyway. \"Besides, I\u0027m the one who needs you.\"\\n\\n He snorted and sat back down at the table, picking up his pen. \"I don\u0027t intend to argue with you all afternoon.\"\\n\\n \"Fine.\" She tucked the oven mitts under her arm. \"Now promise me you\u0027ll eat dinner.\"\\n\\n He glared at her and shook his head.\\n\\n Macy sank into the chair across from him with a deep sigh.\\n\\n \"By the way, what\u0027s the name of that singer your grandmother liked? It\u0027s seven letters.\"\\n\\n \"Barry Manilow?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, that\u0027s the one.\" He filled in the squares, then immediately started working on the area around that answer.\\n\\n Macy exhaled again, just to remind him she was still there.\\n\\n \"What are you doing now?\" he grumbled, briefly glancing in her direction.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m staying here until you promise me you\u0027re going to test my new recipe.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you\u0027ll have a long wait. I haven\u0027t been hungry in five years.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got time,\" she lied.\\n\\n \"Thought you had a job today.\"\\n\\n \"I do.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to be late.\"\\n\\n \"In that case, they might not ask me to work for them again.\" Actually, that was more of a guarantee. In Sharman\u0027s world, as he\u0027d repeatedly pointed out, time was money.\\n\\n Harvey snorted once more. \"I suppose you\u0027re going to blame me if you lose this job.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll probably lose everything,\" she said dramatically.\\n\\n \"You could always sell your art. That is, if you ever finished a project.\"\\n\\n Macy shrugged. \"Not much of a market for it in this economy.\"\\n\\n He muttered something under his breath. \"If I agreed-- and I do mean if--would I have to eat the whole thing in one sitting?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be silly.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the silly one,\" he said. \"Don\u0027t know why you can\u0027t leave an old man alone.\"\\n\\n \"But, Harvey, you\u0027re my best friend.\"\\n\\n \"Me and all those cats you\u0027re constantly feeding. What you need is a dog.\"\\n\\n \"I prefer cats.\" It was really the other way around; the cats seemed to prefer her. She had Snowball, Peace and Lovie, who were her inside friends, and there were an additional four or five who showed up at irregular intervals, expecting a handout. They\u0027d sort of adopted her. She\u0027d never gone looking for pets; they just seemed to find her.\\n\\n \"Get,\" Harvey said, waving both hands at her. \"Go on. Get out of here.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry, can\u0027t do it until you give me your word.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re as bad as your grandmother.\"\\n\\n \"Worse,\" she returned. \"Or so you\u0027ve told me dozens of times.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, worse. No need to quibble about it. I\u0027ll have you know this was a nice, peaceful neighborhood until your grandmother moved in. Just my luck that she willed you the place. Between the two of you, I haven\u0027t had a moment\u0027s rest in over forty years.\"\\n\\n \"You love me.\" He\u0027d deny it to his dying day, but Macy knew otherwise. He\u0027d loved her grandmother, too--more than he\u0027d ever admit.\\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t,\" he stated emphatically. \"I tolerate you. Your grandmother turned out to be a good friend, but you need someone to keep an eye on you and it\u0027s not going to be me.\"\\n\\n \"We need each other,\" she said and meant it. Harvey was her last link to her beloved grandmother. Lotty Roth had adored Macy and her curly red hair and her quirky personality. Macy had always been...different. While other children got involved in sports and music and dance, Macy had been what her grandmother referred to as a free spirit. She\u0027d never had any interest in organized activities, and her artistic abilities were developed on her own. She\u0027d rather stand in front of a painting at a museum or a gallery, absorbing its beauty and skill, than analyze the artist\u0027s techniques in a classroom.\\n\\n She could remember once, in sixth grade, being called upon to answer a history question about the Civil War. She\u0027d stood quietly next to her desk, and the teacher had repeated the question. Macy knew the answer, but she\u0027d been thinking about something else that seemed far more important at the time--her plans to draw one of her cats and how much fun it would be once she got out of class to sit down with Princess and a pencil and pad. When her teacher demanded an answer, Macy started talking about Princess and her antics, and soon everyone was laughing-- except Mrs. Moser, who\u0027d sent her to the principal\u0027s office for disrupting the class. As her father used to ruefully say, Macy was a few French fries short of a Happy Meal.\\n\\n Her grandmother had been her one ally when it seemed Macy didn\u0027t have a friend in the world. Grandma Lotty\u0027s home was her refuge. Like Macy, Lotty Roth had possessed an artist\u0027s soul, and that was something they\u0027d had in common. They\u0027d seen the world in a similar way, from their passionate love of animals to their delight in unconventional people and places. When her grandmother died two years earlier, to everyone\u0027s surprise she\u0027d left Macy her house.\\n\\n Macy had loved this old home with its gingerbread trim and immediately painted it yellow with bright red shutters. The white picket fence was still white but only because she\u0027d run out of paint. Harvey frequently complained that the house looked as if someone from Candy Land had moved in next door.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re gonna be late,\" Harvey said now.\\n\\n \"Guess so,\" she said with an exaggerated yawn.\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t you just tell me that if you showed up late one more time they wouldn\u0027t use you again?\"\\n\\n \"Yup. That\u0027s what Mr. Sharman said.\"\\n\\n Harvey closed his eyes and threw back his head. \"So when you lose the house, you\u0027ll tell me I should let you live in one of my spare bedrooms.\"\\n\\n \"Could I?\" she asked cheerfully.\\n\\n \"No,\" he snapped.\\n\\n \"All it\u0027ll take to avoid a complete upheaval of your life is a simple promise.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s blackmail.\"\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s for your own good.\" She glanced pointedly at her watch. \"It\u0027d be a real shame to lose this job, not to mention a potential career in radio commercials.\"\\n\\n \"For crying out loud,\" Harvey said and slammed down his pen. \"All right, I\u0027ll eat some of the casserole.\"\\n\\n Relieved, Macy grinned, leaped up from the chair and kissed his leathery cheek. \"Thank you, Harvey.\"\\n\\n The old man rubbed the side of his face, as if to wipe away her kiss. He frowned in her direction.\\n\\n Macy, on the other hand, couldn\u0027t have been more delighted.\\n\\n \"Gotta scoot,\" she said as she bounded out the door. \"See you later.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t hurry back,\" he shouted after her.\\n\\n Macy grinned. Harvey loved her the same as he had her grandmother. She\u0027d figured out years ago that the louder he fussed, the deeper his affection.\\n\\n Home again, Macy grabbed her purse and car keys and hurried outside. If she made every green light, she wouldn\u0027t be more than five minutes late.\\n\\n Mr. Sharman might not even notice.\\n\\n Chapter Five\\n\\n I didn\u0027t call Winter and she didn\u0027t try to reach me again, either. The truth is, I\u0027ve never been much good at this dating thing. When I first met Hannah, she made everything so easy. I was attracted to her; she was attracted to me. I like that kind of honesty and straightforwardness. You so often find it in children, less often in adults, which is one reason I chose pediatrics. I\u0027d make more money in another specialty, but I\u0027ve only ever wanted to work with kids.\\n\\n Frankly, I regretted going to the French Cafe. I wasn\u0027t ready to go out into the world; life was complicated enough. Still, Winter\u0027s phone number sat on the corner of my office desk and seemed to taunt me. I lost track of time while I looked at it. Then indecision would overcome me once again and I\u0027d glance away.\\n\\n Friday nights were always the worst for me. Hannah and I had made a practice of doing something special on Fridays. She called it our date night. That didn\u0027t mean we went out for fancy dinners and dancing or stuff like that. We couldn\u0027t have afforded it in the early years. But on Friday nights we spent time together, no matter what. Our \"date\" could be cuddling on the sofa, watching a rented movie and ordering pizza, or--especially later on-- it might be a full-blown dinner party with three or four other couples.\\n\\n Hannah loved to host parties. She enjoyed cooking and having friends over. She made everything look effortless and possessed a gift for making others feel comfortable. I\u0027d come to enjoy these occasions far more than I\u0027d ever expected. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-5.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) \\n My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;. \\n On the anniversary of his beloved wife\u0027s death, Dr. Michael Everett receives a letter Hannah had written him. \\n In it she reminds him of her love and makes one final request.
