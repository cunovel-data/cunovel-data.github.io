Her name tag identified her as Linda Barclay. The woman was certainly friendlier than the physician who employed her, but that wasn\u0027t saying much. However, based on a few comments she\u0027d made, Macy suspected the nurse had a better sense of humor than the doctor.\n \"He\u0027s in his office,\" Linda said, pointing the way.\n The last time she\u0027d stopped by, Linda had escorted Macy directly into Dr. Everett\u0027s office; on this visit, she\u0027d been left twiddling her thumbs in the waiting room. That was probably because Macy had taken it upon herself to read one of his precious medical books. He\u0027d practically snatched the book out of her hands, not giving her the opportunity to explain why she\u0027d taken it in the first place. She\u0027d been studying the index because she wanted to look up certain symptoms. Harvey just didn\u0027t seem to be himself lately, and she was worried. He blamed his fainting spells on the fact that he hadn\u0027t eaten, but Macy thought it was more than low blood sugar. Besides, it\u0027d happened again recently. On that occasion, she knew Harvey had eaten less than an hour earlier. Something else was responsible for all this, and her friend was too stubborn to make a doctor\u0027s appointment. Well, there were other ways to deal with this situation.\n Between her cat and her neighbor, Macy was in need of medical advice, although she\u0027d have to be crafty if she was going to get any valuable information from Dr. Everett. Granted, she\u0027d already suggested an exchange of favors during their previous meeting, but he hadn\u0027t seemed enthusiastic. She\u0027d have to handle him with finesse.\n When Macy walked into his office, Michael was sitting behind his desk. He glanced up when she entered.\n \"I was on time,\" she told him pointedly.\n He stared back at her, apparently unaware of the significance of this feat.\n \"I was late the first day we met, remember?\"\n \"Oh, yes. By quite a bit, as I recall.\"\n \"But--\" she raised her index finger \"--I had a good excuse.\"\n \"Well, congratulations for being on time this afternoon.\" A hint of a smile touched his eyes.\n Oh, what Macy would give to see him really smile. The urge to walk over and turn up the edges of his mouth with her fingertips was almost overwhelming. She cocked her head to one side as she tried to imagine what he\u0027d look like amused.\n \"Macy?\" he said, frowning. \"You have the drawings?\"\n \"Oh, yes. Sorry. I was trying to get a picture of you in my mind.\"\n \"I\u0027m standing right here. Why would you want to do that?\"\n \"I was trying to picture you happy. You know-- smiling, maybe even laughing. You don\u0027t do that very often, do you?\"\n He turned away from her as though he found her exasperating.\n \"It\u0027s a shame,\" Macy felt obliged to tell him. \"That I don\u0027t smile?\"\n \"Well, yes. It must be hard to frown all the time. I once read that it takes twice as many muscles to frown as it does to smile.\"\n \"Perhaps my lack of amusement has something to do with my limited patience.\"\n That was a clear-cut reminder that she was there for a specific purpose.\n \"You were going to show me the new sketch for the mural. That is the reason you\u0027re here, correct?\"\n \"I have the new sketch with me.\" The man was all business, which didn\u0027t bode well because she needed his help and wanted to propose an exchange, the \"favor\" she\u0027d mentioned last week. While considering how best to broach the subject, she carefully removed the sketch, which she\u0027d rolled into a tight scroll, from her backpack.\n Dr. Everett took off the rubber band and unrolled the new sketch across the table. He secured it, then stepped back to examine her proposal.\n \"These animals are behind bars,\" he said with a grimace. He looked up at her, his frown deepening.\n \"You said you wanted zoo animals. I did what you asked,\" she said, trying not to sound defensive. \"See the gorilla?\"\n \"Why is he caged?\"\n \"Have you visited a zoo lately?\" She wasn\u0027t in favor of imprisoning wild animals, and this whole zoo concept had bothered her.\n \"I said I wanted zoo animals,\" he said, speaking slowly as if she was hard of hearing. \"I didn\u0027t ask you to draw a zoo scene. You took me far too literally.\"\n \"I can paint it without the bars.\" She\u0027d be happy to do that, in fact, but she\u0027d wanted to give him precisely what he\u0027d asked for. Apparently, he\u0027d taken offense; maybe he didn\u0027t approve of zoos, either.\n \"I asked for a jungle scene.\"\n \"In a zoo,\" she added. \"But like I said, I\u0027ll take away the bars. Other than that, does this sketch suit you?\" She wondered if he\u0027d remember he\u0027d used that very word in their previous meeting.\n He went over each detail. \"It does,\" he said slowly. \"You\u0027re actually quite talented,\" he told her, and she wasn\u0027t sure whether to be pleased or insulted by the surprise in his voice.\n \"Thank you.\" A compliment--well, she\u0027d settle for that.\n \"When would you like me to start?\" she asked, eager now to get down to the negotiations. They\u0027d already agreed on a price, although, as she\u0027d told him, it was half of what she normally charged.\n \"You can begin this week if you like.\"\n \"Great. However...\"\n \"How long do you think it\u0027ll take you to complete the project?\" he asked.\n Macy wasn\u0027t fooled. He wanted her in and out of his office as quickly as possible. Well, she wasn\u0027t keen on spending any more time than necessary with him, either.\n \"A couple of weeks, tops.\" She paused. \"Um, if you\u0027ll recall, the figure I quoted you is half my usual fee.\" She gestured with one hand, but when she noticed how he glared at it, she immediately lowered it. \"As you might also remember, that price is contingent on you doing me a favor.\"\n Predictably, he frowned.\n \"I might be able to finish in ten days,\" she said, changing tactics.\n \"What\u0027s this favor?\" he asked with unmistakable sarcasm.\n \"Just to see a patient.\"\n \"That\u0027s it?\"\n \"That\u0027s it.\"\n \"Fine.\" He pulled open a desk drawer and took out his checkbook. \"I\u0027ll give you fifty percent up front.\"\n \"Thanks.\" She\u0027d hoped he\u0027d pay her an advance.\n He sat down at his desk and started to write the check. She watched for a moment before blurting out her question. \"Do you make house calls?\"\n \"House calls?\"\n \"Yes. That\u0027s when a doctor visits a patient\u0027s home and diagnoses that patient in the comfort of his or her own environment.\"\n He sighed. \"I know what a house call is.\"\n \"I figured you would.\" She sent him a bright smile. \"So, do you make them?\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t,\" he said.\n \"But would you?\" she asked hopefully.\n \"No.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you think it would be better to see patients when they\u0027re relaxed and comfortable?\"\n \"Depends.\"\n \"Wouldn\u0027t you be able to make a more accurate assessment?\"\n \"Not always. There are tests I couldn\u0027t run at a patient\u0027s house.\"\n \"But you could order those, right?\" she persisted.\n \"Is there a reason you\u0027re asking me all these questions? Does it have to do with the patient you want me to see?\"\n \"Y-e-s.\" She drawled the word, but didn\u0027t elaborate. She needed to line up her arguments first.\n \"I don\u0027t make house calls so it\u0027s a moot point,\" he said with finality.\n \"But you could.\"\n \"No,\" he said. \"For malpractice insurance reasons it\u0027s out of the question.\"\n \"Oh.\"\n He closed his checkbook and returned it to the top drawer.\n \"But what if we bartered for it?\" Macy asked.\n \"That\u0027s irrelevant. As I explained, because of my insurance restrictions, it\u0027s impossible, no matter how you paid for it.\"\n She bit her lip and tried a different approach. \"I have a friend I want you to meet.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Because he\u0027s sick and refuses to see a doctor.\"\n \"How old is your friend?\"\n \"Eighty-six.\"\n Dr. Everett\u0027s eyebrows rose. \"In case you haven\u0027t noticed, I\u0027m a pediatrician. I treat children. I have no expertise in geriatrics.\"\n \"That\u0027s all right,\" Macy said half-humorously. \"Harvey sometimes says he\u0027s going through his second childhood.\"\n The physician didn\u0027t even crack a smile. \"I apologize, but I can\u0027t see your friend on a professional basis.\"\n \"Could you just meet him?\"\n \"Socially I can meet anyone.\"\n Macy clapped her hands. \"That\u0027s perfect. Then I\u0027ll stick to my original agreement. I\u0027ll paint the mural at the price I quoted the other day. Otherwise...it would have to be more.\"\n Dr. Everett closed his eyes, then opened them again. \"Ms. Roth, first, your business practices are questionable, to say the least. Second, I have no intention of meeting your friend.\"\n \"Okay, if you insist I\u0027ll pay you, but the mural will be fourteen hundred dollars instead. I was giving you a fifty percent discount for meeting Harvey.\"\n He exhaled in what seemed to be complete confusion. \"You have no idea what you\u0027re asking me to do.\"\n He was probably right, but Macy was desperate. \"Harvey is a wonderful old man and I don\u0027t think he realizes how sick he is. He doesn\u0027t have anyone in the world. Except me--and Sammy.\"\n \"Sammy\u0027s his son? But you said--\"\n \"No, he\u0027s a stray dog I rescued. I found him in the street. He would\u0027ve been killed if I hadn\u0027t gone after him. I share him with Harvey.\" She didn\u0027t understand why it was so important that he hear every detail, but she couldn\u0027t make herself stop talking. Macy was sure that once Michael got to know Harvey, he wouldn\u0027t be able to refuse.\n \"At first Harvey didn\u0027t want anything to do with Sammy, but he needs someone with him and I can\u0027t be there as much I\u0027d like. Sammy\u0027s great and I can tell he belonged to someone, so I put up notices hoping to find his rightful owner, but the truth is, I was just as glad no one claimed him because Sammy\u0027s such a good companion for Harvey.\" This last part was said in one gigantic breath.\n \"Ms. Roth--\"\n \"Please,\" she said, willing to beg if necessary. \"Harvey\u0027s like a grandfather to me. I love that old man and want him to live for many years to come. He\u0027s a war hero, you know.\"\n \"Ah...\"\n \"Please. I\u0027ll paint the mural for free if you\u0027ll come and meet Harvey. That\u0027s all I want--for you to meet him. You don\u0027t have to listen to his heart or take his blood pressure or anything else that would put you at risk with the big powerful insurance company.\"\n He hesitated and Macy could see he was thinking about it.\n \"Harvey never married,\" she said, rushing ahead with more reasons for him to meet her neighbor. \"He was in World War II and fought in the South Pacific. He once told me he got malaria and was sick for months and then he was captured by the Japanese and we both know those prison camps weren\u0027t like Camp Winnemucca where I went each summer as a kid.\"\n \"My grandfather was in the war, too,\" the doctor said quietly.\n Again Macy could see that he was giving the matter serious consideration. Perhaps she\u0027d misjudged him. She felt she was generally a good judge of character and wondered if she\u0027d been too quick to find fault with Dr. Everett. \"If this was your grandfather, wouldn\u0027t you want someone who cared about him to get a doctor to visit? Wouldn\u0027t you?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-23.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) \n My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;. \n On the anniversary of his beloved wife\u0027s death, Dr. Michael Everett receives a letter Hannah had written him. \n In it she reminds him of her love and makes one final request.
