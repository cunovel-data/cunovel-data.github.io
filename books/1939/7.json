{"id":66225,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Inside the house, I tossed my car keys on the counter and then sat on the edge of the sofa. \"I lost it,\" I told Hannah. \"I just lost it.\" Kenny deserved everything I\u0027d said and done, and in that sense I didn\u0027t regret it. However, I\u0027d been called upon to treat the sick and injured--nothing less and certainly nothing more.\\n\\n Generally, I picked up something to eat on my way home from the clinic. But I hadn\u0027t thought of food all evening, although I hadn\u0027t eaten since noon. My stomach growled.\\n\\n I located a can of soup, heated that and ate it over the kitchen sink. When I finished I set down the bowl and just stood there. I was still angry. My hands became clenched fists.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t do it anymore,\" I told Hannah.\\n\\n How I missed her. How I needed her. She would\u0027ve been horrified by the regular attacks on Shamika and concerned about my uncharacteristic loss of control. Undoubtedly she would\u0027ve found the perfect words to comfort me and ease my mind.\\n\\n But Hannah wasn\u0027t here. She never would be again and I\u0027d need to deal with instances like this on my own. I\u0027d acted foolishly. But while I regretted cracking, I didn\u0027t regret threatening that wife-beater.\\n\\n It was midnight before I\u0027d calmed down enough to go to bed, but sleep didn\u0027t come. After tangling the sheets, rolling one way and then the other, I decided to sit up and read. That didn\u0027t help, and in an act of pure desperation, I reached for the photo of Hannah. It was one of my favorites--she was walking in an open field, carpeted with blooming wildflowers. I\u0027d taken it on a day trip to Hurricane Ridge several years before. I kept the framed photograph by my bedside and now I set it on the pillow next to mine.\\n\\n As I suspected it would, having Hannah\u0027s picture close soothed me and I finally fell asleep.\\n\\n I woke to the bright light of morning and lay on my back, gazing up at the ceiling as I replayed the events of the previous night. I turned my head to one side to look for Hannah\u0027s photograph, planning to replace it on my nightstand. I was surprised to find it missing.\\n\\n I sat up and looked around. It took me a few minutes to discover that at some point I must have thrashed around and caused the photograph to fall to the floor.\\n\\n I leaned over to retrieve it and found the glass shattered and the frame broken.\\n\\n Chapter Six\\n\\n I work out at the gym three days a week, but on Saturday mornings, I usually run. After my five-mile jog, I stepped into the shower and let the spray beat down on my back while my thoughts churned. I couldn\u0027t get the vision of Hannah\u0027s broken photograph out of my mind. It felt almost as if she was telling me how upset she was that I hadn\u0027t done what she\u0027d asked, which I realized was ridiculous. And yet...the glass had shattered. Why\\n\\n now, I wanted to know, after the countless times I\u0027d placed it on the empty pillow next to mine? I\u0027m not a superstitious man; I believe in science and rational behavior. But I couldn\u0027t help wondering if Hannah was the reason I instantly recalled Winter\u0027s phone number. Of course, the fact that I\u0027d stared at it for ten minutes yesterday evening might have something to do with it.\\n\\n I waited until nine-thirty, then called. Winter answered on the second ring.\\n\\n \"Hello.\"\\n\\n \"Hi, Winter. It\u0027s Michael,\" I said. Actually, I\u0027d been hoping the call would go to voice mail and I could escape talking to her. No such luck.\\n\\n \"Michael! It\u0027s so good to hear your voice. How are you? No, don\u0027t answer that, I know how you are.\"\\n\\n \"You do?\"\\n\\n \"You miss Hannah. Oh, Michael, I do, too.\"\\n\\n So I\u0027d been right. Hannah would be the primary focus of our conversation.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s been a year.\"\\n\\n \"Me, neither,\" I muttered. In some ways, though, it felt much longer.\\n\\n \"I heard you stopped by the cafe,\" Winter continued. \"I\u0027m sorry I wasn\u0027t there. I hope you\u0027ll come again.\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"How about now?\"\\n\\n \"Now?\" I repeated.\\n\\n \"Unless you\u0027ve got other plans. We can have coffee, spend a few minutes catching up.\"\\n\\n Perhaps it would be best to get this over with quickly. I\u0027d fulfill my duty and then go back to missing Hannah. She wouldn\u0027t be able to fault me once I\u0027d made the effort. \"It\u0027ll take me fifteen minutes to get there.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s perfect. How do you like your coffee?\"\\n\\n \"Black,\" I told her.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll start a fresh pot. It\u0027ll be ready by the time you arrive. Would you like a croissant?\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t turning one down. \"That would be wonderful.\"\\n\\n \"Great. I\u0027ll see you soon.\"\\n\\n \"Bye.\" I hung up and paused while I considered what had just taken place. All week I\u0027d worried about what I\u0027d say, but so far, dialogue on my part had hardly been necessary. Winter seemed pleased, even excited, to hear from me, although I hadn\u0027t seen her in more than a year.\\n\\n All at once an idea struck me. Was it possible that Hannah had written letters to the three women on the list, as well? This hadn\u0027t occurred to me before, and it paralyzed me.\\n\\n After a few minutes, the pounding of my heart subsided as I decided on a plan of action. I\u0027d sound Winter out. Naturally I\u0027d broach the question carefully. If the letter to me was the only one Hannah had written, then I didn\u0027t want Winter--or anyone else--to know about it. Ritchie knew, of course, but I could trust him to keep his mouth shut.\\n\\n I left the house and made the short drive to Blossom Street in less than ten minutes. The downtown area was starting to show signs of life as business owners opened for the day. I noticed the yarn store across from the French Cafe and pulled into an empty slot in front of it. Cody Goetz was a patient of mine and I\u0027d met Lydia, his mother and the shop\u0027s owner, on a number of occasions. The family had recently adopted a twelve- or thirteen-year-old girl. Hannah had always wanted to learn how to knit. She\u0027d intended to knit our baby a blanket and had signed up for classes at A Good Yarn just before we learned she had cancer. The classes were forgotten, although Hannah had been so eager to knit that baby blanket....\\n\\n A baby blanket!\\n\\n I turned my thoughts away. No need to depress myself more than I already was.\\n\\n I jaywalked across the street and entered the restaurant. I saw Winter right away.\\n\\n \"Michael!\" She stepped out from behind the counter, extending her arms toward me, hugging me as I drew close.\\n\\n \"Hello, Winter.\"\\n\\n She held me as I stood there limply, my arms dangling awkwardly by my sides. After a moment I hugged her back.\\n\\n She smiled up at me. \"It\u0027s wonderful to see you.\"\\n\\n \"You, too.\" I forced a bit of enthusiasm into my voice.\\n\\n She was lovely, and although I looked hard for a resemblance to Hannah, I didn\u0027t see any. Winter was blonde with blue eyes. Hannah had dark hair and dark brown eyes. They were about the same height, but the similarity ended there. As I studied her, I recognized the expressive, mobile face Hannah had liked so much. A face that was very different from her own.\\n\\n \"Come sit over here.\" Winter led me to a table by the window. The day was overcast; otherwise, I would\u0027ve preferred to sit outside. The entire cafe had an inviting ambience, however, with flowered tablecloths, comfortable chairs and warm lighting.\\n\\n While I pulled out a chair and sat down, Winter motioned to a young pregnant woman at the counter who efficiently delivered two mugs of steaming coffee and a plate of croissants.\\n\\n \"You have a nice place,\" I commented as I reached for the coffee. \"I was here the other day and it was busy.\"\\n\\n \"We do a good business,\" she said. \"I didn\u0027t know what to expect with the downturn in the economy, but I\u0027ve been pleasantly surprised.\"\\n\\n I noticed that her prices were reasonable. For those fortunate enough to have a job nearby, it would be convenient to stop in for coffee on the way to the office.\\n\\n \"What are your hours?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"We open early,\" she replied. \"Alix, our baker--\" she gestured at the woman who\u0027d served us \"--comes in around five and does the baking, including the croissants. Then Mary arrives at six and takes care of the morning crowd. We have a steady flow of regulars.\"\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n \"Business quiets down around midmorning and then picks up again with the lunch crowd. We serve soup, salads and sandwiches.\"\\n\\n The specials for the day were listed on the blackboard out front. The soup was beet with ginger and the salad was spinach with blue cheese and dried cranberries. Colorful and creative, I thought.\\n\\n \"We stay open until nine-thirty.\"\\n\\n \"So you serve dinner, too.\"\\n\\n \"The menu\u0027s the same for lunch and dinner,\" she explained. \"I wasn\u0027t sure evenings would work, but I was wrong. There are enough people living in the neighborhood to make the longer hours worth my while.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s great.\" I glanced around appreciatively. Pictures of the Eiffel Tower, the Seine and other distinctive French scenes decorated the walls.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve worked hard to make this cafe a success,\" Winter told me, her voice ringing with pride. \"Hannah used to encourage me....\" Her voice trailed off.\\n\\n I stared down into my coffee. \"Like you said, it\u0027s hard to believe Hannah\u0027s been gone a year.\"\\n\\n \"It is,\" Winter agreed quietly.\\n\\n I held my breath. \"I\u0027m starting to clear out her things.\" A bold-faced lie if there ever was one. \"I wondered if there was anything of hers you\u0027d like to have.\"\\n\\n Winter\u0027s eyes misted and she brought her hand to her heart. \"Oh, Michael, that\u0027s so thoughtful of you.\"\\n\\n \"Hannah loved you. You were her favorite cousin.\"\\n\\n Winter looked as if she might cry. Other than Hannah\u0027s, I never could deal with other people\u0027s emotions. Since her death, I often find myself in the role of comforter. It\u0027s difficult to ease someone else\u0027s pain, especially when my own is so debilitating.\\n\\n \"Is there anything of special significance? Anything you\u0027d treasure?\" I asked.\\n\\n Winter shook her head. \"I treasured my cousin. I didn\u0027t realize how much until she was gone.\"\\n\\n I understood the feeling. I took a croissant, ripped off a piece, but didn\u0027t eat it. I was afraid if we headed down this path of memories it would depress us both.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t think of anything I\u0027d want. Whatever you\u0027d like to give me is fine.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the connection with France?\" I asked, changing the subject.\\n\\n Winter regarded me for a long moment. \"I went there with Pierre.\"\\n\\n \"Pierre?\"\\n\\n \"Pierre Dubois. We...we used to be involved.\"\\n\\n \"You met in France?\" I was trying to remember if Hannah had mentioned any of this. The name sounded familiar.\\n\\n \"No, we met here in the States. At one time we worked together, but that was ages ago now,\" she said, lowering her voice slightly. \"I flew over to meet Pierre\u0027s family and loved every minute--the food, the culture, the people. Being there inspired me. When I decided to open my own cafe I wanted to duplicate those memories.\"\\n\\n I smiled, caught up in her words. Then I remembered Hannah telling me about Winter and some Frenchman she\u0027d been dating. A guy she\u0027d worked with at a classy restaurant. The same guy who\u0027d caused her grief.\\n\\n \"I suppose you\u0027re wondering about me and Pierre?\" Winter asked. \"I\u0027m sorry we were never able to attend the dinner parties you and Hannah had. With our work schedules, it was impossible. But maybe that was just as well.\"\\n\\n \"Ah...\" I wasn\u0027t sure how to respond.\\n\\n \"He and I are taking a break from each other,\" Winter said. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-7.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) \\n My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;. \\n On the anniversary of his beloved wife\u0027s death, Dr. Michael Everett receives a letter Hannah had written him. \\n In it she reminds him of her love and makes one final request.
