{"id":66256,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"Leanne was well aware of what might happen once the\n enemy got hold of him. The evening news had been filled\n with nightmarish accounts of beheadings and brutal\n beatings. The fact that these men and women weren\u0027t\n military, were just contract workers, didn\u0027t seem to matter. \"We don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on,\" Muriel told her again.\n \"The company\u0027s promised us they\u0027re doing everything in\n their power to rescue Mark.\"\n \"He should never have been in that helicopter in the first\n place,\" Leanne cried, lashing out in her pain.\n Muriel sobbed. \"I...I agree.\"\n The silence stretched between them. Leanne was afraid\n to close her eyes for fear of the appalling images that would\n come to life.\n \"I felt you\u0027d want to know,\" Muriel said again. \"Thank you.\"\n They disconnected, but for a long time Leanne held on\n to her cell. She struggled to assimilate this terrible news.\n Ever since her divorce, her family and friends had insisted\n she should get on with her life. Her counselor, too, had\n advised her to focus on the future.\n Leanne had done that, or tried to. She\u0027d gotten involved\n in the Kids with Cancer program and had organized the\n volunteers for the picnic. She\u0027d gone out with friends,\n joined a reading group, taken a class on new cancer therapies. She\u0027d dated Michael Everett. Nothing had worked.\n Nothing had eased the ache in her heart. She loved Mark.\n She\u0027d never stopped loving him. She realized it the Sunday\n she\u0027d driven to Yakima; she knew it when she heard he\u0027d\n taken a job in Afghanistan.\n Now it might be too late to tell him she still cared, still\n needed him. She\u0027d followed everyone\u0027s advice, did her best\n to move on, and to a certain extent she had.\n As soon as she returned to the hospital, she went to see\n her supervisor.\n Janet glanced up from her desk and frowned. \"Leanne,\n what\u0027s wrong?\"\n \"I need a leave of absence as soon as possible,\" Leanne\n said, unable to keep the tremor out of her voice. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Janet asked again, sounding alarmed. Leanne told her about Muriel\u0027s call.\n \"What will you do? Where will you go?\"\n Leanne didn\u0027t have an answer. \"I don\u0027t know yet...but\n I\u0027m too upset to be any good to anyone here. I need to be where I can get information about Mark, no matter what\n it is.\"\n \"Where would that be?\"\n Janet forced her to think logically. \"With his parents in\n Spokane.\" She took a deep breath. \"They shouldn\u0027t be alone.\" \"Then that\u0027s where you need to go.\"\n Leanne nodded, grateful that her friend understood. \"Go home,\" Janet said. \"Now.\"\n \"But my patients--\"\n Janet removed her glasses and set them aside. \"I\u0027ll take\n over for the rest of the day and I\u0027ll arrange your leave. Like\n you said, you\u0027re too emotional to work right now. I\u0027ll call\n you once I\u0027ve talked to HR.\"\n \"Thank you,\" Leanne whispered. Janet had helped her\n figure out what to do. Sometime in the next few days,\n she\u0027d leave to be with Mark\u0027s family. They\u0027d support one\n another through this.\n Janet stood and hugged her. \"Do you have any idea\n how long you\u0027ll be away?\"\n \"No...\"\n \"I\u0027ll be praying for you and Mark and your family.\" \"Thank you.\"\n Leanne didn\u0027t remember the drive home or dragging her\n suitcase out of the spare-room closet. She\u0027d just finished\n packing when she got a call from Janet telling her that the\n leave of absence had been arranged.\n \"Keep us updated,\" Janet said.\n \"I will and thank you so much.\"\n Ten minutes later, she let the building super know she\u0027d be away. Then she carried her suitcase outside and thrust\n it in the trunk of her car.\n Not until she was in the driver\u0027s seat did she think to\n call her former in-laws to explain her intentions. Shuffling through her purse, she searched for her cell\n phone. It wasn\u0027t in the side pocket where she normally kept\n it. When she finally located it in the bottom of her purse,\n she heaved a sigh of relief. Her fear was that, traumatized\n as she was, she\u0027d left it at the bus stop.\n Holding it gratefully with both hands, she pressed the\n button that would redial the number of the last call\n received. Brian Lancaster answered on the first ring. \"Hello?\" He sounded anxious, no doubt worried that\n this was the call he\u0027d been dreading.\n \"It\u0027s Leanne.\"\n Brian took an audible breath. \"Muriel phoned you?\" \"Yes.\" She didn\u0027t elaborate. \"I\u0027m driving to Spokane.\n Can I stay with you and Muriel until...until...\" She left\n the rest unsaid and held her own breath; she felt as if her\n lungs might explode.\n \"Should you be driving?\" he asked. Brian was the practical one in the family. Levelheaded, competent, rational,\n and Leanne admired him. Mark was a lot like his father. She released her breath. \"Probably not, but I\u0027m coming, anyway.\"\n \"Will anything I say stop you?\"\n \"No.\"\n Brian\u0027s voice cracked. \"I think we all need to be prepared\n for the worst. Come. Stay as long as you like. Muriel needs you and, frankly, I don\u0027t think I can help her get over the\n death of our son....\"\n Brian had always been strong, the dock everyone had\n tied their boats to in the crazy storm that had struck their\n family. He\u0027d stood by Mark, hired a good attorney for his\n son, helped his daughter settle into a new life and remained\n the bulwark of strength they all relied on. But this--the\n thought of losing Mark, his only son--was more than\n even he could bear.\n \"I\u0027m on my way,\" Leanne whispered.\n After a long pause, he whispered back. \"Thank you.\"\n Chapter Thirty\n Macy and I never really got a chance to talk in any detail about why she\u0027d suddenly disappeared from my office or where she\u0027d gone the previous Friday. I thought it had something to do with one of her many au\n ditions. But then the pizza arrived and the two of us joined Harvey and chatted happily over dinner and beer. When we\u0027d finished, I helped clean up and then we went to Macy\u0027s to feed the animals. I\u0027d never considered myself a cat person, but I realized it was because I hadn\u0027t been around them very often. I was becoming fond of Macy\u0027s three, and they seemed to reciprocate the sentiment. Sammy had accepted me, too, so I was friends with all the furry denizens of 255 Jackson Avenue, all the creatures who seemed to understand that I loved Macy as much as they did.\n Once they were fed, Macy and I cuddled on her sofa and watched television. Instead of talking about her insecurities, trying to deal with the differences between us, we kissed. Soon coherent thought vanished. Soon all I could think about was how good it felt to have this woman in my arms. This warm, whimsical, vibrant woman.\n My feelings for Macy had intensified since her accident. In the past few days, I\u0027d found that my thoughts constantly turned toward her: what she was doing, who she was rescuing--even what she was humming. She\u0027s such a natural with people; kids and animals love her. Macy\u0027s impulsive and nonconformist, yet that\u0027s all part of her appeal.\n Unlike Macy, I rarely act on impulse, but I did the next Tuesday morning. Macy had a radio spot she was recording today; yesterday she\u0027d had another audition--a callback, she\u0027d told me proudly. I wanted to give her a gift; I wanted her to know how glad I was that she\u0027d come into my life. The idea of replacing her bicycle occurred to me, and I remembered the small shop where I\u0027d purchased the bikes for Hannah and me.\n As I\u0027d hoped, they were still in business. I called the store and described Macy\u0027s unique personality; Mel Wellborn, the owner, laughed and said he had just the bike for her. I looked at the picture on his Web site and had to agree. It was pink with orange tassels on the handlebars and limegreen pedals. Apparently, a clown had special-ordered it and then changed his mind. Mel quoted a price that made my head spin, but I couldn\u0027t refuse. The picture on the Internet proclaimed that this was the perfect bike for Macy, so I bought it and was told I could pick it up that evening.\n I called her during my lunch break. Fortunately--since, predictably, she didn\u0027t have a cell phone--she hadn\u0027t left for the studio yet. \"Are you going to be home tonight?\" I asked.\n \"Yes...\" The hesitation in her voice gave me pause. \"I\u0027d like to stop by.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n \"Are you sure you aren\u0027t too busy?\" I asked.\n \"Michael, I want to see you.\"\n \"I can come another night if you prefer.\"\n \"No...no. I have something I\u0027m dying to tell you.\" Her voice bubbled with excitement.\n \"Tell me now,\" I urged.\n \"I want to wait until I see you. This is just the most wonderful thing that\u0027s happened to me since...since I met you.\"\n Her words brought me a sense of contentment. \"Meeting you has been wonderful for me, too, Macy.\"\n Macy went from effusive to silent. \"Do you mean that, Michael?\" she asked after a moment.\n \"With all my heart.\"\n She was quiet again.\n \"What time will you be home?\" I asked.\n \"The earliest I can make it is six--make that six-thirty in case I\u0027m late leaving the studio. I really am trying to be on time, you know.\"\n \"I do know,\" I assured her.\n After a few words of farewell, I hung up the phone, but my hand stayed on the receiver, as though I could hold on to that connection with Macy.\n After more than a year of lonely grief, of self-imposed isolation, I found that I craved the company of others. Craved evenings with Macy and her menagerie of people and pets, playing poker with my friends, laughing again. Because of Macy I\u0027d stepped out of the shadows.\n At the end of the day I left the office as early as possible, then drove straight to the bicycle shop to get Macy\u0027s gift. Mel was an older guy who, like many small-business owners, offered great personal service. I hadn\u0027t considered how I\u0027d transport the bike, so I had to purchase a bike carrier for the car, which I hoped Macy and I would put to good use.\n Mel installed the carrier, and I loaded up the bike, driving first to the wine boutique, then to Macy\u0027s house. I could hardly wait to see her face suffused with delight when she saw this crazy bike.\n Her car was parked outside, so I knew she was home. I pulled in behind her. These days I smiled when I saw her house with the bright red shutters and the white picket fence. Even now, it looked like something out of a fairy tale to me. I could believe that one day I\u0027d find Sleeping Beauty inside having tea with Cinderella--and Macy.\n Before I\u0027d climbed out of the car, Macy opened her front door and dashed down the steps. By the time I made it through the gate, she\u0027d launched herself into my embrace, twining her arms around my neck. I grabbed her by the waist and swung her around.\n \"I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re here,\" she said fervently.\n I kissed her because it was impossible not to. I couldn\u0027t be this close to her and resist. But she was so lovely I had trouble taking my eyes off her, even to kiss her.\n \"I want to tell you my news,\" she said, breaking off the kiss.\n I set her back down on the sidewalk and waited for her to speak. But before she did, she placed her hands on either side of my face and kissed me again. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-38.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) \n My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;. \n On the anniversary of his beloved wife\u0027s death, Dr. Michael Everett receives a letter Hannah had written him. \n In it she reminds him of her love and makes one final request.
