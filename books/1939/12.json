A couple of minutes later she heard him voice his opinion of their houseguest and then race back, yowling a long list of complaints.\\n\\n \"He isn\u0027t staying,\" she promised. \"He\u0027s lost. How would you feel if you were lost?\"\\n\\n In response, Snowball turned his back and ignored her completely.\\n\\n \"Fine, if that\u0027s how you\u0027re going to be.\"\\n\\n Macy dressed in white jeans and an olive-green sweater, then ran a brush--not the one she\u0027d used on Sammy-- through her tangle of red curls. The makeup people would see to her hair and face later. This assignment, a photo shoot for a yarn company catalog, was scheduled for eleven. Radio was more fun, but the money she made from modeling put food in the cats\u0027 dishes.\\n\\n She let Sammy into the yard, where he relieved himself against the fence--good thing Harvey wasn\u0027t out yet. A moment later he came back in and she refilled bowls and made a pot of coffee. Taking her cup, she wandered outside, which was part of her morning ritual. Sammy was busy wolfing down his breakfast.\\n\\n Harvey had come into the backyard by now, a hoe in his hands, weeding his garden. She sat down on the step, savoring the cool spring air.\\n\\n \"Good morning, Harvey,\" she greeted him cheerfully.\\n\\n He ignored her and continued hoeing. After a minute or two he muttered, \"Don\u0027t see anything good about it. Seems like every other morning to me.\"\\n\\n \"I had company last night,\" she told him.\\n\\n \"Anybody I know?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t think so. He\u0027s a real sweetheart, though.\"\\n\\n Harvey straightened and leaned against the hoe. He frowned. \"You hiding a man inside your little house?\"\\n\\n \"Definitely a male.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose you took in another stray. How many cats are you feeding, anyway? Your grandmother would be shocked if she knew you\u0027ve turned her home into a cat house.\" He grumbled some other remark that she couldn\u0027t quite hear.\\n\\n \"I need a favor.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t do it,\" he said and returned to weeding his garden. He lowered his hat over his eyes as if to shut her out completely.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not a cat,\" she said as she walked to the fence and sipped her coffee. Sammy needed a place to stay until she could locate his owner or find a new one, and Harvey needed a friend. As far as she was concerned, it was meant to be. A perfect match.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll bet it isn\u0027t a man, either,\" Harvey said. \"Now that\u0027s something you could use. I don\u0027t understand what\u0027s wrong with you.\"\\n\\n Admittedly, she had problems with relationships. She\u0027d dated lots of men and even fallen in love a time or two. But eventually the men in her life seemed to grow disenchanted with her. They found her too disorganized, too eccentric, too impulsive. Initially her unconventional nature appealed to them, but then they decided they wanted a more \"nine-tofive kind of woman,\" as one of them had put it.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with me.\"\\n\\n He snorted.\\n\\n \"Are you going to help me or not?\"\\n\\n \"Not.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m counting on you, Harvey.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t care, I\u0027m not doing it. You aren\u0027t getting me involved in one of your schemes, so don\u0027t even ask.\"\\n\\n Sammy poked his head out the back door and padded carefully down the four back steps.\\n\\n \"Harvey, meet Sammy,\" she said, gesturing toward the dog.\\n\\n Harvey glanced in her direction, then rolled his eyes. \"It isn\u0027t bad enough that you\u0027re feeding cats. Now you\u0027ve added a dog to your menagerie.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a stray. Look at him. Doesn\u0027t he just melt your heart?\" \"Are you the one who gave him that ridiculous haircut?\" \"I didn\u0027t have a choice, his hair was so matted.\" \"You bathed him, too?\"\\n\\n \"I had to. He was filthy.\"\\n\\n \"Probably infested with fleas.\"\\n\\n \"Probably, but I got rid of them last night.\"\\n\\n \"So you say.\"\\n\\n \"Listen, I have to leave in a few minutes. I\u0027m doing a photo shoot for that yarn company I was telling you about. They need me for hair and makeup at ten.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t let me hold you up. Go.\" He waved her away.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t leave Sammy here alone.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\"\\n\\n Macy edged her way along the fence line, following him as he hoed. \"Snowball\u0027s taken a dislike to him.\"\\n\\n \"At least one of your cats shows some intelligence.\"\\n\\n \"Harvey, will you watch him while I\u0027m gone? Please?\"\\n\\n He shook his head emphatically. \"Not me.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll only be for a couple of hours.\"\\n\\n \"Tie him up in your backyard.\"\\n\\n Macy had already considered that option. \"How would you like a rope around your neck?\" Unfortunately the yard wasn\u0027t fully enclosed.\\n\\n Harvey didn\u0027t respond.\\n\\n \"Sammy\u0027s lost and frightened.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d be frightened, too, if I had Snowball giving me the evil eye.\"\\n\\n \"Two hours,\" she murmured pleadingly. \"Three at the most.\"\\n\\n \"Ten.\"\\n\\n \"Ten what?\"\\n\\n \"Hours. I know how you operate, Macy Roth. You have no concept of time. One hour or six--it\u0027s all the same to you. I am not looking after that dog, so you might as well accept it right now.\"\\n\\n Sammy ambled over to the fence and stared up at Harvey.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you start.\" He pointed an accusing finger at the dog, then turned to Macy. \"Did you teach him to look at me like I\u0027m his last friend in the world?\"\\n\\n \"When would I have had time for that?\"\\n\\n \"Go back inside because you\u0027re wasting your breath. I\u0027m no babysitter to a flea-infested mutt.\"\\n\\n She bent down and whispered to Sammy.\\n\\n \"What did you just tell that mangy dog?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, you did,\" he insisted. \"I saw your lips move.\"\\n\\n \"If you must know, I told him not to pay any attention and to just go on over and visit.\"\\n\\n Harvey buried the hoe in the freshly turned dirt. \"Why is it you ignore everything I say? I don\u0027t know why I even bother to talk to you.\"\\n\\n \"Because you love me.\"\\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t. Now kindly leave an old man alone.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t do that. Sorry. I guess I\u0027ll call and cancel my part in the photo shoot.\"\\n\\n Harvey removed his hat and wiped his brow. \"That trick isn\u0027t going to work this time, so you can forget it. I don\u0027t care if you lose your job.\" He wagged his index finger at her. \"And you aren\u0027t moving in with me if you lose your grandmother\u0027s house, either. I refuse to let you blackmail me.\"\\n\\n \"Not to worry, I told Sammy to stay here and keep an eye on you.\"\\n\\n Harvey scowled. \"If he\u0027s on your side of the fence, it\u0027s fine. But I don\u0027t want him digging in my garden.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll make sure he knows to wait right here and I\u0027ll tell him to look after you, too.\"\\n\\n \"You do that, because if he sets one paw on my land, I\u0027m calling the dogcatcher.\"\\n\\n \"Harvey, you wouldn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tempt me.\"\\n\\n Macy rolled her eyes. \"I\u0027ll be back in a few hours.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever.\"\\n\\n \"Look after him for me, Harvey.\"\\n\\n \"I said I wouldn\u0027t, and I won\u0027t.\"\\n\\n Nevertheless, Macy figured it wouldn\u0027t be long before Sammy won over her neighbor. She\u0027d let the two of them sort it out.\\n\\n She put out fresh water for her animals and threw the dirty towels in the washer before grabbing her backpack and heading out the door. She left Sammy in the backyard, confident in Harvey\u0027s kindness despite all disclaimers to the contrary. Her cats were inside the house.\\n\\n When she went to start the car, she saw that she was desperately low on gas. Considering what a nice day it was, she decided to ride her bicycle.\\n\\n She got it out of the garage and pedaled down the street. It really was a lovely morning.\\n\\n Chapter Ten\\n\\n I\u0027ve always been fascinated by how wise children often are, especially those with cancer. Despite the fact that they\u0027ve been dealt a crummy hand in life, these kids are impressive. In my observation, children, by their very nature, are optimistic and in most cases far more realistic than their parents. I hadn\u0027t been looking forward to this picnic, but my reasons had nothing to do with the kids. My fear had to do with my colleagues. I was afraid some of them--like Patrick--would use the opportunity to set me up with one of their friends. My concerns were wellfounded, judging by the way they\u0027d reacted to the news that I planned to attend.\\n\\n Saturday morning I arrived at the park around tenthirty. The weather had cooperated, although there was a huge gazebo for shelter in case of rain. The rhododendrons and azaleas were in full bloom, just as they were in Hannah\u0027s garden at home. Splashes of soft color all around reminded me of a Monet painting. Children raced around, some with hair and others without. Today was a day for fun and laughter, games and prizes, food and friends. For this short period they could forget about everything associated with cancer. Their parents, too, could put aside their worries and fears and simply enjoy the day.\\n\\n As I walked to the picnic area I saw Patrick O\u0027Malley strolling toward me. He grinned and held up his hand in greeting. Although we worked in the same practice, we didn\u0027t often get a chance to talk. I owed Patrick. He\u0027d covered for me so I could be with Hannah, especially toward the end. That had made turning down his request nearly impossible. Patrick had asked me to help and I could do nothing less.\\n\\n \"Glad to see you made it,\" Patrick said when we met. \"And congratulations. I heard you\u0027ve been nominated for Fischer-Newhart\u0027s Pediatrician of the Year. That\u0027s huge!\"\\n\\n I shrugged off his praise. The pharmaceutical company, which specialized in medication for children, gave a major award once a year in four regions of the country. This was my first nomination and it\\n\\n was a big deal. Of course, Linda knew and my parents, too, but I hadn\u0027t mentioned it to anyone else. Being singled out sort of embarrasses me. Always has. My goal is to be a good doctor and to make children well. That\u0027s it. I don\u0027t need any public acknowledgment. The award was to be presented at a large banquet, the type of event everyone hates but feels obligated to attend. The thought of sitting through the evening alone held no appeal. I could invite someone; I just didn\u0027t know who.\\n\\n I rubbed my hands together, eager to mingle with the kids. \"Where do you need me most?\"\\n\\n \"We could use some help with the games,\" Patrick said, reminding me of his original request.\\n\\n \"Perfect.\"\\n\\n \"Then later you can flip burgers.\" He slapped me affectionately on the back.\\n\\n Within minutes I was laughing and horsing around with the kids. I regretted my bad mood earlier in the week. I blamed Hannah\u0027s letter for that. I wanted to argue with her, tell her I\u0027d rather forget the outside world as much as possible, and she seemed to know that. I resented, at least a little, that a woman who\u0027d been gone a year still had the power to manipulate me into something I had no interest in doing. Yet how could I refuse her?\\n\\n A couple of hours later I was exhausted. I\u0027d participated in the three-legged race, teaming up with James, a tenyear-old boy who probably wouldn\u0027t see his eleventh birthday. We crossed the finish line first and James wore his blue ribbon proudly.\\n\\n Somehow or other, I got conned into being a partner with Kellie, a six-year-old with leukemia, for the egg toss. We lost--the egg broke in my hands, much to Kellie\u0027s delight. I wasn\u0027t any luckier with the water-balloon toss, but managed to jump far enough back to avoid getting soaked. After that, I put on an apron that read The Cook Is King and stood in front of the barbecue, grilling hamburgers. I noticed James wolfing his down and saw tears in his mother\u0027s eyes as she watched her son eat. I suspected it\u0027d been a long time since he\u0027d had this much of an appetite. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-12.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) \\n My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;. \\n On the anniversary of his beloved wife\u0027s death, Dr. Michael Everett receives a letter Hannah had written him. \\n In it she reminds him of her love and makes one final request.
