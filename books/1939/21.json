{"id":66239,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Hannah had chosen three women and now I\u0027d met all of them. They were as different from one another as any three women could be. As far as I could tell, Hannah had included Macy Roth for comic relief. Hardly ever had anyone, male or female, irritated me more. Hannah had suggested that Macy would make me laugh; however, she\u0027d been wrong. If anything, Macy left me with the urge to pull out my hair by the roots. For all my musing I hadn\u0027t come to a firm decision about Winter or Leanne. I\u0027d hire Macy to paint the mural, but not out of any genuine desire to know her. I\u0027d spent maybe ten minutes in her company and had no doubt whatsoever about how I felt. She was off the list. The mural was a good idea, though, and if the photographs were any indication, her work was acceptable. I\u0027d give her the job. I\u0027d completed my duty as far as Hannah was concerned. I\u0027d met Macy and made my decision. That left Winter and Leanne. It was only fair I get to know them both, then make my choice. Or not. I found a semblance of peace in that nondecision. A calmness of spirit. I wasn\u0027t sure I\u0027d ever experience real peace again, but this felt close. I was satisfied with what I\u0027d determined to do. The rest of the day passed smoothly and I\u0027d just seen my last patient for the day, a six-year-old boy who\u0027d managed to get a tiny toy car stuck up his nose. I showed him a couple of magic tricks I saved for occasions such as this, which helped him relax, and I was able to retrieve it from his sinus cavity. Young Peter\u0027s awed reaction to my \"magic\" delighted me, and I was grinning as I walked out of the exam room. Linda met me at the door. \"This is your day for female visitors,\" she said, looking pleased with herself--as if she alone was responsible for bringing these women into my life. I assumed it was Leanne Lancaster. \"She\u0027s brought a sketch for you.\" Macy Roth. I could\u0027ve finished the week without another confrontation with that screwball and been happy. \"Is she waiting in my office?\" \"She is.\" I wanted to tell Linda to wipe that smirk off her face. Macy Roth was not a love interest, past, present or future. When I entered my office I caught her leafing through a medical book. That annoyed me. It took a lot of nerve to remove a volume from my private library without asking permission first. She glanced up and didn\u0027t reveal the slightest embarrassment. I walked over, pulled the book out of her hands and pointedly replaced it on the shelf. \"You brought a sketch?\" I asked. \"Yes, I put it on your desk.\" I was curious about the type of scene she might have envisioned for my wall. If she was as imaginative as I supposed, the idea would be clever and amusing. I had a small table in the room and rolled out the sketch, anchoring it with a paperweight and a book on opposite corners. One look at the ocean scene, and I frowned. She\u0027d drawn a wave and in the crest of it were turtles and tropical fish of all sizes and colors. In the distance beyond the wave, a sailfish leaped into the air. There was a whale in the background. \"This isn\u0027t what I want,\" I said, trying to understand what I found so objectionable. I suspected it was more my attitude toward Macy than the sketch itself. Still, I felt the kids who came into my practice might think it wasn\u0027t interesting or whimsical or exotic enough. The mural was meant to entertain and distract them, not provide a zoology lesson. \"Why not?\" she challenged. \"I just don\u0027t. It\u0027s not...kid-themed,\" I muttered. \"You told me to draw whatever I felt would work, and I did.\" \"True, and I apologize, but the ocean scene doesn\u0027t suit me,\" I said flatly. \"I\u0027d like another alternative.\" She was right; I\u0027d basically given her free rein, but at the same time I retained approval. \"Come up with a different approach.\" \"Fine,\" she said shortly. She reached for the sketch and rolled it up. \"I don\u0027t have a problem with developing something else. However, before I spend several hours putting together a new scene, it would help if I had some idea of what you\u0027re looking for.\" \"I don\u0027t know. Zoo animals, I suppose.\" \"Zoo animals,\" she repeated, obviously disappointed in my answer. \"I can do that...I guess.\" \"In a jungle scene,\" I added. \"Gorillas, giraffes and lions should do nicely.\" \"You got it.\" \"When can I expect to see a new sketch?\" Macy paused, eyes on the ceiling as though mentally reviewing her commitments. \"Does Monday afternoon work for you?\" I walked behind my desk to my appointment calendar and nodded, then wrote it in. \"That should be fine. Make it 5:00 p.m.\" Nodding, Macy stopped on her way to the door. \"Are you positive you don\u0027t like the ocean scene?\" \"Unfortunately, yes.\" My reaction had been immediate. \"I could throw in a ship. I\u0027d thought of doing that and I didn\u0027t, and now I\u0027m sorry.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t have liked it with the ship, either,\" I told her. \"Harvey liked it...well, as much as Harvey likes anything.\" \"Is Harvey one of your cats?\" I remembered that Macy had several cats. Why that detail stuck in my mind I could only speculate. She talked about them as if they were human, which was odd enough, but soliciting a cat\u0027s views on a piece of art... \"Harvey is my neighbor, and he has exquisite taste.\" This was apparently a dig at me for disliking the ocean scene. I recalled that she\u0027d mentioned this Harvey in our first phone conversation. \"No doubt he does, but it isn\u0027t his office where you\u0027ll be painting the mural.\" \"That\u0027s too bad,\" she muttered. \"One day another client might ask you for an ocean scene and you\u0027ll have it in your inventory.\" She shrugged, but didn\u0027t respond. I steered her toward the door, unwilling to continue the conversation. I wasn\u0027t interested in her next-door neighbor\u0027s opinion. The only opinion that mattered here was mine, and I didn\u0027t want the children who came into my office staring at fish. \"I\u0027ll have the jungle scene for your review on Monday,\" Macy said as she swept out of my office. \"At five.\" Feeling a twinge of guilt I realized my attitude wasn\u0027t entirely fair or open-minded. Macy was simply too...unconventional for me. Too erratic and unpredictable. In any case, I felt I\u0027d done my duty by Hannah. From this point forward I\u0027d concentrate my efforts on Winter and Leanne. Thinking about Winter, I decided now was a good time to give her a call and thank her for the croissants. I waited until everyone had left the clinic, then closed my office door. Surprisingly, I felt a sense of anticipation. I tried to think of something Winter and I might do together. I\u0027d taken Leanne to dinner and, while that had been pleasant, I was looking for a different activity with Winter, since she owned a restaurant and eating out might be too much like work for her--too much like checking out the competition. I called Winter\u0027s cell number; she answered on the second ring. \"It\u0027s Michael. I wanted to thank you again for the croissants,\" I began. \"You\u0027re very welcome.\" She seemed pleased to hear from me, and that was encouraging. \"The croissants disappeared so fast I was fortunate to get one.\" I\u0027d eaten it with my lunch and savored every bite. \"There\u0027s always more where those came from,\" she teased. I felt utterly inept at flirting, but stumbled ahead. \"I was hoping, you know, that the two of us might get together soon.\" \"Ah, sure. When?\" \"How about Sunday afternoon?\" I tossed that out, although I didn\u0027t have a single idea of what we might do. \"What do you suggest?\" \"Well...\" I thought for a moment. \"If the weather\u0027s nice we could ride bikes.\" This was something Hannah and I used to enjoy. A surge of pain tightened my chest. I was surprised when the memory didn\u0027t hurt as much or last as long as I\u0027d come to expect. \"I...don\u0027t have a bike,\" Winter said with what sounded like regret. \"Not to worry, I have an extra one in the garage. Actually, it belonged to Hannah.\" I figured Winter wouldn\u0027t mind borrowing Hannah\u0027s old bicycle. \"Okay, why not? But I have to warn you it\u0027s been years since I got on a bike.\" \"You\u0027ll pick it up right away,\" I assured her. \"It really is true that once you\u0027ve learned you never forget.\" \"That\u0027s good to know.\" Already I was looking forward to the weekend. We chatted for a few more minutes and then just before I was ready to hang up Winter said, \"I\u0027m glad you called.\" \"I am, too,\" I said and I meant it. Wherever our relationship went--whether we became close friends or casual ones, whether we experimented with romance or eventually fell in love--I was prepared to accept. What would be would be. Chapter Seventeen \"I have to wear a helmet?\" Winter asked. \"It\u0027s the law in King County,\" I explained. She seemed uncertain about every aspect of this venture. I was beginning to think taking out the bikes hadn\u0027t been such a great idea, after all. Winter had dressed in a matching pants outfit, and I worried that her cuff would get caught in the chain. By the time I noticed, it was too late to suggest she change clothes. I found a couple of metal pant clips and used them to secure the loose material, a concession to safety if not fashion. Her rhinestone-studded flip-flops weren\u0027t ideal for bike riding, either. I still had a pair of Hannah\u0027s biking shoes and recommended she wear those. Their feet seemed to be about the same size. Since Winter hadn\u0027t cycled in years, I worked with her for several minutes until I was confident she wouldn\u0027t have a problem. Then we both climbed on our bikes and rode up and down the block before we set out beyond the neighborhood. \"How are you doing?\" I called back to her. \"Great.\" Her reply sounded tentative, so I made another circuit of the block, riding slowly. Hannah had been a competent cyclist, but it was unfair to compare Winter to her. I\u0027d need to remind myself of that. I appreciated Winter\u0027s willingness to at least try. My hope was that in time she\u0027d come to enjoy biking, which I loved. I was surprised to realize how long it\u0027d been since I\u0027d last taken out my bike. Hannah and I had often talked about riding in the STP, the Seattle to Portland Bicycle Race held every July. It\u0027s a two-day event and we\u0027d been gearing up for the ride when Hannah was diagnosed. She\u0027d wanted me to participate, but I\u0027d refused. It wouldn\u0027t have been any fun without her. Ritchie rode a stationary bike at the gym, but I couldn\u0027t imagine him out on the streets in a serious ride. Not because he lacked athletic ability, but because he couldn\u0027t care less about cycling. Baseball was his sport and he was a rabid Seattle Mariners fan. He watched or attended every game the team played, memorized the stats and was a font of useless information. Useless, that was, in my opinion, although I\u0027d never say that to Ritchie\u0027s face. Absorbed in my own thoughts, I hadn\u0027t noticed that I\u0027d gotten quite far ahead of Winter. I glanced over my shoulder and saw her wobbling dangerously. I turned my bicycle, intent on rejoining her. Winter saw me turn and for whatever reason decided to stop. I could see her start to fall, but I was unable to help. She couldn\u0027t get her foot released fast enough and as a result she crashed onto her side, the bicycle on top of her. It seemed to happen in slow motion, but I\u0027m sure it didn\u0027t feel that way to Winter.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-21.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;.
