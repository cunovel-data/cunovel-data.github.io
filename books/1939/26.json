He\u0027s the one--\"\n \"I remember who Harvey is and Sammy and Puffball and--\"\n \"Snowball.\"\n \"Whatever,\" he said with some impatience. \"Now, what were you saying?\"\n \"You were going to come by. We had a lengthy conversation about it. You haven\u0027t forgotten, have you?\"\n \"I remember every word of our conversation. As I recall, we left it open-ended.\"\n \"But I said Monday,\" she insisted, mentally reviewing their exchange. \"I know I did.\"\n \"Perhaps. However, I made no specific commitment.\"\n That problem was easily solved. \"Then how about tonight?\"\n \"I have plans this evening.\"\n \"Oh.\" Well, so much for that. Still, Harvey was expecting to meet Michael and it would be a shame to disappoint him. \"I don\u0027t suppose you could alter your plans slightly and stop by the house for a few minutes?\" she asked hopefully. \"I\u0027m sure it wouldn\u0027t take long.\"\n \"Sorry, I can\u0027t.\"\n \"Drat.\" She sighed loudly. \"But you did agree. I mean, this isn\u0027t a delaying tactic, is it? Because I\u0027m really concerned about Harvey.\"\n \"Has there been another incident like the one you mentioned earlier?\" Michael asked.\n \"Not that I know of, but then Harvey wouldn\u0027t tell me if there was.\" Her neighbor was stubborn in the extreme; he was also a cantankerous old fool. Hmm, Michael and Harvey should get along fine, seeing how similar they were.\n \"Does Wednesday fit with your schedule?\" he asked, pulling out his cell phone and scrolling down.\n \"Anytime.\" She\u0027d change whatever needed changing because this was too important to miss.\n After they\u0027d arranged a meeting on Wednesday, Macy returned to work, drawing into the late afternoon. Michael went into his office while she was putting the finishing touches on an elephant. He left his door open. She didn\u0027t intend to eavesdrop, but she couldn\u0027t help overhearing what he had to say. His \"plans\" appeared to be with someone named Leanne. No wonder meeting Harvey took second place--he was having dinner with this other woman.\n Annoyed, yet aware that she was being unreasonable, Macy packed up when clinic hours were over and followed Linda Barclay out the door.\n \"The sketch is coming along nicely,\" Linda commented.\n \"Thanks.\" Macy was afraid she\u0027d need to redo the entire afternoon\u0027s work. She felt it hadn\u0027t translated from her preliminary drawing to the wall as well as she\u0027d hoped. It didn\u0027t help that she\u0027d spent most of the afternoon brooding about Michael. She decided to blame her less-than-ideal work on the fact that she wasn\u0027t allowed to hum.\n \"Dr. Everett recently lost his wife,\" Linda said as they entered the elevator together.\n \"Yes,\" Macy told her. \"I knew Hannah.\"\n \"You did?\"\n \"I\u0027d never met Michael. I saw him at the funeral. Wasn\u0027t it sad?\"\n \"Oh, it was,\" Linda agreed. The elevator reached the bottom floor and they stepped out. \"See you in the morning,\" she said as she headed toward the parking garage.\n Macy walked to the bus stop, which was right outside the building. Using public transportation was so much easier than bringing her car and paying for parking. When she got home, she fed her cats and gave them some attention, then went out back. Harvey sat in his Adirondack chair, wearing his hat, a book propped open on his lap. She scrambled over the fence and joined him.\n \"Where\u0027s your friend?\" he asked.\n \"He couldn\u0027t make it. He\u0027s coming on Wednesday instead.\"\n \"You don\u0027t sound happy about it,\" he said. \"I\u0027m used to turning down my hearing aid when you\u0027re around. What\u0027s wrong?\"\n \"You know what\u0027s wrong--I don\u0027t like Michael.\"\n \"Really? Then he isn\u0027t much of a friend, is he?\"\n Sighing, Macy plopped down on the lawn next to Harvey and fanned out her skirt. The grass felt damp and cool against her skin. Sammy ambled over to lie beside her, resting his chin on her thigh.\n \"So, what\u0027s the problem with your boyfriend?\" Harvey persisted.\n \"He most definitely is not my boyfriend,\" Macy said, frowning. \"You know what he did?\"\n \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll tell me.\"\n Harvey rarely showed even this much interest in any topic. She paused and regarded him suspiciously. Maybe he was feeling sick again, trying to distract her.\n \"What\u0027s the problem now?\" he challenged.\n \"You. You\u0027re acting too friendly.\"\n \"Count your blessings.\"\n Macy couldn\u0027t figure out what to make of this change in attitude. \"You\u0027re not feeling well, are you?\"\n \"I\u0027m perfectly fine.\"\n \"No, you aren\u0027t.\" She wondered how long he\u0027d been sitting in his chair.\n \"Don\u0027t tell me how I feel,\" he snapped.\n Macy\u0027s fears lifted. \"That\u0027s more like it,\" she said cheerfully.\n \"Leave an old man alone and take that mongrel with you.\"\n \"Sammy\u0027s yours now.\" She considered herself his coowner, or more accurately, one of his guardians. But Sammy\u0027s principal role was to be Harvey\u0027s companion.\n \"I don\u0027t want him.\"\n \"Too bad, he\u0027s part of the family.\"\n \"I thought you were looking for his owners. Seems to me you should\u0027ve found \u0027em by now.\"\n \"No one claimed him.\"\n \"If he was mine, I wouldn\u0027t have claimed him, either,\" Harvey remarked.\n \"Harvey!\" she cried, covering Sammy\u0027s ears. \"You\u0027ll hurt his feelings. Everyone needs to be loved.\"\n \"Including you.\" He gave her a sly look. \"I got a feeling about you and this doctor fellow.\"\n \"Me? Oh, please! We were talking about Sammy.\" And Harvey, too, but she dared not say that aloud.\n \"Yes, you,\" he said. \"Here you are, complaining about the only man you\u0027ve mentioned in months.\"\n \"He doesn\u0027t like me.\"\n \"I don\u0027t like you, either,\" Harvey muttered, \"but that doesn\u0027t stop you from making a pest of yourself.\"\n \"With you I\u0027m doing it for show.\"\n \"Are not,\" he insisted. \"Now, tell me why you think this doctor isn\u0027t completely smitten with you.\"\n \"Smitten,\" she repeated and smiled just saying the word. \"Well, for one thing, he asked me not to hum. I like show tunes, so I hum when I paint, but he says it gets on his nerves.\"\n \"Seems to me you stirred him up.\"\n She rolled her eyes. \"We were supposed to get together tonight,\" she elaborated, wanting Harvey to understand how far off base he was. \"Just as friends, you know. But now Michael has another...appointment.\"\n \"Didn\u0027t you say he was coming over on Wednesday?\"\n \"Well, yes, but...\"\n \"He probably has something important this evening. Doctors are busy people.\"\n \"He\u0027s got a date,\" Macy informed him primly. \"I heard him talking to her. He asked if dinner was still on for tonight.\"\n Harvey was undaunted. \"Who said the dinner was with a woman?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know many men named Leanne.\"\n \"Don\u0027t take it personally. He\u0027s seeing you on Wednesday.\"\n \"I still don\u0027t like him.\" She grinned. \"Guess you\u0027ll have to marry me instead.\"\n \"Don\u0027t want to. Give him another chance.\"\n \"Don\u0027t want to,\" she echoed.\n \"So this doctor\u0027s playing the field. Good for him. If I was sixty years younger I would, too.\"\n \"Oh, Harvey. I told you--we\u0027re just friends.\" Even that was a stretch, but she didn\u0027t want Harvey questioning why she\u0027d invite a man she didn\u0027t like.\n \"Nope, I know the signs. You think I lived this long without kicking up my heels once in a while? I was quite the ladies\u0027 man in my younger days.\"\n Smiling, Macy plucked a blade of grass. \"I bet you were.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you get discouraged now, you hear me?\"\n \"I\u0027m not discouraged.\"\n \"Good. This doctor has the hots for you.\"\n \"The hots?\" Macy laughed out loud. \"Wait till you meet him. Then you\u0027ll see for yourself how wrong you are.\"\n \"Wanna bet? He sounds like exactly the right kind of man for you.\"\n \"We\u0027d make a terrible couple. He\u0027s so...stuffy.\"\n \"Then he needs you.\" He turned and glared at her. \"And you need him.\"\n Macy shook her head. Even if she was attracted to Michael--and she wasn\u0027t admitting that at all--they were completely unsuited. Total opposites.\n Just to take one example, she liked to hum and he liked to frown.\n Chapter Twenty-One\n I stopped at a wine \"boutique\" and picked up a bottle of champagne for dinner with Leanne. She\u0027d be making either crispy pork chops or, more likely, something Italian. I was wandering around the store, trying to decide if I should bring red or white wine. The clerk, who came around the counter to offer assistance, suggested champagne.\n \"It isn\u0027t just for weddings, you know,\" he told me. \"Champagne goes with everything.\" He recommended Drappier. I\u0027d never heard of the brand, but I took him at his word and purchased the bottle.\n When I arrived at Leanne\u0027s I was glad I\u0027d gone to the trouble of buying something out of the ordinary. The aroma coming from her kitchen was delectable, and I sniffed appreciatively.\n \"I\u0027m making an Italian dish,\" Leanne said as she led me into her apartment, \"but my family background is German. My great-grandmother came through Ellis Island in the late 1890s. Apparently, she was a wonderful cook.\"\n I was grateful for a homemade meal, especially after my excellent dinner with Winter. I\u0027d forgotten how good it was to eat something that didn\u0027t come from the freezer or out of a can. And any meal I didn\u0027t have to fuss with was a major improvement over my own haphazard dinners.\n \"My grandmother used to make a pot roast every Saturday,\" Leanne said. \"She baked it in the oven with different vegetables and then parceled out the leftovers to whoever came for the meal. That sometimes meant a dozen people.\"\n \"That many?\" She smiled. \"Always. Grandma never learned to cook for two. She made enough to feed a family of ten her whole life. No one complained--except Grandpa, who peeled the potatoes.\"\n \"Well, I may not be doing anything as useful as peeling potatoes, but I did bring this.\" I set the cold bottle of champagne on the kitchen counter.\n \"Thank you,\" Leanne said with another smile. She motioned toward the stove. \"I hope you like lasagna.\"\n \"Sure do.\"\n \"I prepared it yesterday afternoon, so all I had to do was put it in the oven once I got home from work.\"\n She moved to the cupboard and took down two wineglasses. \"I apologize, but I don\u0027t have champagne flutes.\" \"These will do just as well.\" I tried to sound knowledgeable, as if I often served high-quality champagne and other wines. Actually, I\u0027d gotten quite an education that afternoon and was intrigued by the number of wines available from every corner of the world. I\u0027d return to that store, I decided. It was time I took an interest in something other than medicine.\n While Leanne washed and dried the glasses, I removed the foil and the wire casing. I turned my back, thankful for the clerk\u0027s advice on how to remove the cork, which came out with a festive pop. I figured that made me look like an expert. If I\u0027d been with Ritchie, I would\u0027ve lifted the bottle high and demanded extravagant praise. But because I was playing the role of sophisticate, I acted as though this accomplishment was par for the course. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/hannah-s-list-blossom-street-7/page-26.html","bookId":1939,"book":{"id":1939,"title":"Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Hannah\u0027s List (Blossom Street #7) \n My darling Michael, I know this letter will come as a shock to you\u0026hellip;. \n On the anniversary of his beloved wife\u0027s death, Dr. Michael Everett receives a letter Hannah had written him. \n In it she reminds him of her love and makes one final request.
