{"id":44823,"no":58,"title":"CHAPTER LVIII.--HOME.","content":"The comfort and splendour of the fashionable club-house, the tall mirrors, the gilded cornices, the soft carpets, the massive furniture, the powdered and liveried waiters gliding noiselessly about, all impressed me with a high sense of the intense snugness of England and of home, after my airy tent, with its embankment of earth for shelter, its smoky funnel of mess-tins, and the tiny trench cut round it to carry away the rainwater. Then I was discussing a breakfast which, after my Crimean experience, seemed a feast fit for Lucullus or Apicius, and listening with something of a smile to the rather loud conversation of some members of the club--wiry old Peninsulars, Waterloo and India men, who were certain \"the service was going to the devil,\" and who drew somewhat disparaging comparisons between the way matters had been conducted by our generals and those of the war under Sir John Moore, Lynedoch, Hill, and \"the Iron Duke;\" and to me it seemed that the old fellows were right, and that after forty years of peace we had learned nothing new in the art of campaigning. \n \n \"Captain Hardinge, a gentleman for you, sir,\" said a waiter, presenting me with a card on a silver salver; and I had barely time to look at it ere Sir Madoc Lloyd, in top-boots and corded breeches as usual--his ruddy sunburnt face, his white hair and sparkling dark eyes, in his cheery breezy way the same as ever--entered, hat and whip in hand, and welcomed me home so warmly, that for a moment he drew the eyes of all in the room upon us. He had breakfasted two hours before--country time--and had a canter round the Park. He was in town on Parliamentary business, but was starting that afternoon for Craigaderyn. I should accompany him, of course, he added, in his hearty impetuous way. Then ere I could speak,-- \n \n \"God bless my soul!\" he exclaimed. \"Poor Harry! till I have seen you I could not realise the idea of your being mutilated thus! No more hunting, no more shooting, no more fishing----\" \n \n \"And no more dancing, the ladies would add,\" said I, smiling. \n \n \"And no more soldiering.\" \n \n \"Unless the Queen kindly permits me.\" \n \n \"Gad! I think you have had enough of it!\" \n \n \"And--and Miss Lloyd and Dora?\" \n \n \"Are both well and looking beautiful. There are not many girls in Wales like my girls. A seaside trip has brought back the bloom to Winny\u0027s cheeks; and as for Dora, she never loses it.\" \n \n \"And why did Miss Lloyd refuse an offer so eligible as that of Sir Watkins Vaughan?\" I asked, after a pause. \n \n \"Can\u0027t for the life of me say,\" replied Sir Madoc, rubbing his chin, and turning to the decanter as a waiter set some dry sherry and biscuits before us. \n \n \"And why would not my little friend Dora have her Guardsman?\" \n \n \"Can\u0027t say that, either. Perhaps she hated a \u0027swell\u0027 with an affected \u0027yaw-haw\u0027 impediment in his speech. Girls are so odd; but mine are dear girls for all that. I\u0027ll telegraph to Owen Gwyllim to have the carriage awaiting us at Chester; and we shall leave town before luncheon-time, if you have no other plans or engagements.\" \n \n \"I have neither; but--but, Sir Madoc, why so soon?\" I asked, as certain passages in my later visits to Craigaderyn gave me a twinge of compunction. \"Now that I think of it, I had an idea of taking a run down to Lewes in Sussex,\" said I. \n \n \"Lewes in Sussex--a dreary place, though in a first-rate coursing country. I\u0027ve ridden there with the Brighton Hunt. What would take you there--before coming to us, at least?\" \n \n I coloured a little, and said, \n \n \"I have a friend there, among the Russian prisoners.\" \n \n \"By Jove, I think you\u0027ve had enough of those fellows! Nonsense, Harry! We shall start without delay. Why waste time and money in London?\" said Sir Madoc, who never liked his plans or wishes thwarted. \"I have just to give a look at a brace of hunters at Tattersall\u0027s for Vaughan, and then I am with you. Down there, with our fine mountain breezes, our six-months\u0027 Welsh mutton, and seven-years\u0027 cliquot, we\u0027ll make a man of you again. I can\u0027t get you an arm, Harry; but, by Jove, it will go hard with us if we don\u0027t get you two belonging to some one else!\" \n \n I laughed at this idea; and so that evening saw me again far from London, and being swept as fast as the express could speed along the North-Western line towards Chester. I had quite a load of Russian trophies--such were then in great request--for Sir Madoc: sabres, muskets, and bayonets; glazed helmets of the 26th and Vladimir Regiments, a Zouave trumpet (with a banner attached), trod flat as a pancake under the feet of the stormers as they poured into the Malakoff. There, too, were several rusty fragments of exploded shells, hand-grenades, and the last cannon-shot fired from the Mamelon Vert. For Winifred and Dora I had mother-of-pearl trunks of rare essences and perfumes; slender gilt vials of attar of roses; daintily-embroidered Turkish slippers, with turned-up toes, and bracelets of rose-pearls from Stamboul; Maltese jewelry, lace, veils, and as many pretty things as might have stocked a little shop in the Palais Royal or the Burlington Arcade. \n \n The month was June, and my spirits became more and more buoyant, as in the open carriage we bowled along between the green mountains and the waving woodlands. Now the mowers, scythe in hand, were bending over the fragrant and bearded grass; the ploughmen were turning up the fallow soil; the squirrels were feasting in the blossom; the sheep were being driven to fold; and the crow was flying aloft, ere he sought his nest \"in the rooky wood.\" It was a thorough English June evening: the air pure, the sunshine bright, and casting the shadows of the mountains far across the vales and fresh green meadows; the blackbird, thrush, and linnet sang on every tree, and a glow of happiness came over me; for all around the land looked so peaceful and so lovely, the gray smoke curling up from copse and dingle to mark where stood those \"free fair homes of England,\" of which Mrs. Hemans sang so sweetly. Sir Madoc was discoursing on the cultivation of turnips and mangold wurzels, and on the mode of extirpating annual darnel-grass, coltsfoot, wild charlock, and other mysterious plants to me unknown; and I heard him as one in a dream, when we entered the long lime avenue. \n \n How pleasant and picturesque looked the old house of the Tudor times at the end of that long leafy vista, with all its tinted oriels, its gilded vanes, and quaint stone finials! The woodbine, clematis, and ivy, hops and honeysuckle, all blended in luxuriant masses, aspiring to peep in at the upper windows. Craigaderyn, so redolent of fruit and flowers, of fresh sweet air, of bright green leaves, of health and every bracing element--a hearty old house, where for generations the yule log had blazed, and the holly-branch and the mistletoe hung from the old oak roof, when the snow lay deep on Carneydd Llewellyn; where the boar\u0027s head was served up in state at Christmas, and at Michaelmas the goose; where so many brides had come home happy, and so many old folks, full of years and honour, gone to the vault of the old church among the hills; where lay all the line of Lloyd, save the luckless Sir Jorwerth Du; and where--. But here my somewhat discursive reverie was interrupted by the carriage being pulled sharply up at the perron before the entrance; and Owen Gwyllim, with his wrinkled face beaming, and his white head glistening in the sunshine, hastened down to open the door, arrange the steps, and shake the only hand the Russians had left me. \n \n \"Where are the young ladies?\" asked Sir Madoc, impatiently glancing up at all the windows. \n \n \"Gone for a ride so far as Llandudno, with Miss Vaughan.\" \n \n \"Alone?\" \n \n \"No, Sir Madoc, attended by Spurrit, the groom. They were gone before your telegram arrived, but are to be back before the first bell rings for dinner.\" \n \n And now, after a little attention to my toilet, I was ushered into the drawing-room, every object in which was so familiar to me; and seating myself in the corner of an oriel, I gave way to a long train of deep thought; for I was left quite alone just then, as Sir Madoc found letters of importance awaiting him; and now, induced by the heat of evening, the stillness broken only by the tinkle of a sheep-bell and the hum of the bees at the open window, and by the length and rapidity of my journey, I actually dozed quietly off to sleep. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1710/50405.html","bookId":1147,"book":{"id":1147,"title":"Under the Red Dragon","description":"简介： And she is to be there--nay, is there already; so one more chance is given me to meet her.
