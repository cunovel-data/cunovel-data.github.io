{"id":44790,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV.--SURPRISES.","content":"Supposing her to have left Walcot Park, as her letter informed me, I rode in that direction no more; and though I knew the family address in London, I could neither write in exculpation of myself nor procure leave to follow her. All furloughs were now forbidden or withdrawn, as the new detachments for the East expected hourly the order to depart. Thus I passed my days pretty much as one may do those which precede or follow a funeral. I performed all my military duties, went to mess, rose and retired to bed, mechanically, my mind occupied by one thought--the anxious longing to do something by which to clear myself and regain Estelle; and feeling in Winchester Barracks somewhat as Ixion might have felt on his fabled wheel, or the son of Clymene on his rock; and so I writhed under the false position in which another\u0027s art and malice had placed me; writhed aimlessly and fruitlessly, save that, although tied up by my promise of secrecy to Estelle, I had written a full and candid detail of the whole affair to Sir Madoc, and entreated his good offices for me. Vainly did Price, little Tom Clavell (the 19th dep?t had come in), Raymond Mostyn of the Rifles, and other friends say, when noticing my preoccupation, \"Come, old fellow, rouse yourself; don\u0027t mope. Are you game for pool to-day?\" \n \n \"Pool with a recently-broken arm!\" I would reply. \n \n \"True--I forgot. Well, let us take Mostyn\u0027s drag to Southampton to-morrow--it is Sunday, no drill going--cross to the Isle of Wight, dine at the hotel, and with our field-glasses--the binoculars--see the girls bathing at Freshwater.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t approve of gentlemen overlooking ladies bathing.\" \n \n \"What the deuce do you approve of?\" \n \n \"Being let alone, Price; as the girls say to you, I suspect.\" \n \n \"Not always--not always, old fellow,\" replied Hugh, with a very self-satisfied smile, as he caressed and curled his fair moustache. \n \n \"Nor the married ones either,\" added Mostyn, a tall showy officer in a braided green patrol jacket; \"for when you were in North Wales, Hardinge, our friend Price got into a precious mess with a selfish old sposo, who thought he should keep his pretty wife all to himself, or at least from flirting with a redcoat.\" \n \n \"Perhaps he was less irritated by the rifle green.\" \n \n \"Come with me into the city,\" urged Clavell; \"the Dean\u0027s lady gives a kettledrum before mess, and I can take a friend.\" \n \n \"Parish scandal, cathedral-town gossip, coffee, ices, and Italian confectionery. Thanks, Tom, no.\" \n \n \"I have met some very pretty girls there,\" retorted Clavell, \"and it is great fun to lean over their chairs and see them look up at one over their fans shyly, half-laughing at, and half-approving of, the balderdash poured into their ears.\" \n \n \"A sensible way of winning favour and spending time.\" \n \n \"I vote for the Isle of Wight,\" continued Clavell; \"I saw la belle Cressingham taking a header there the other day in splendid style. Only fancy that high-born creature taking a regular header!\" \n \n \"Who did you say?\" said I, turning so suddenly that little Tom was startled, and let the glass drop from his eye. \n \n \"Lady Estelle Cressingham; you remember her of course. She had on a most becoming bathing-costume; I could make that out with my glass from the cliffs.\" \n \n \"Clavell, she is in London,\" said I, coldly; \"and moreover is unlikely to indulge in headers, as she can\u0027t swim.\" \n \n \"I know better, excuse me,\" said Mostyn, who, I knew, had dined but lately at Walcot Park; \"she told me that she had been recently bathing, and had studied at the Ecole de Natation on the Quai d\u0027Orsay in Paris.\" \n \n \"It is more than she ever told me,\" thought I, as my mind reverted to our terrible adventure. I became silent and perplexed, and covertly looked with rather sad envy on the handsome and unthinking Mostyn, who had enjoyed the pleasure of seeing and talking to Estelle since I had done so. \n \n \"It is difficult,\" says David Hume, \"for a man to speak long of himself without vanity; therefore I will be short;\" and having much to narrate, I feel compelled to follow the example of the Scottish historian, for events now came thick and fast. \n \n I had barely got rid of my well-meaning comrades, and was relapsing into gloomy reverie in my little room, when I heard voices, and heavy footsteps ascending the wooden stair that led thereto. Some one was laughing, and talking to Evans in Welsh; till the latter threw open the door, and, with a military salute, ushered in Sir Madoc Lloyd, looking just as I had seen him last, save that the moors had embrowned him, in his riding-coat, white-corded breeches, and yellow-topped boots, and whip in hand, for his horse was in the barrack yard. \n \n \"Welcome, Sir Madoc.--That will do, Evans; be at hand when I ring.--So kind of you, this; so like you!\" I exclaimed. \n \n \"Not at all, not at all, Harry. So these are your quarters? Plain and undecorated, certainly; boots, bottles, boxes, a coal-scuttle--her Majesty\u0027s property by the look of it--a sword and camp-bed; humble splendour for the suitor of an earl\u0027s daughter, and the rival of a rich viscount. Ah, you sly dog, you devilish sly dog!\" he added, as he seated himself on the edge of the table, winked portentously, and poked me under the small ribs with the shank of his hunting-whip, \"I suspected that something of this kind would follow that aquatic excursion of yours; and Winifred says she always knew of it.\" \n \n \"Winifred--Miss Lloyd!\" said I, nervously. \n \n \"Why didn\u0027t you speak to me, and consult with me, about the matter when at Craigaderyn? I am certain that I should have made all square with the Countess. Egad, Harry, I will back you to any amount, for the sake of those that are dead and gone,\" he added, shaking my hand warmly, while his eyes glistened under the shaggy dark brows that in hue contrasted so strongly with the whiteness of his silky hair. \n \n \"You got my letter, Sir Madoc?\" \n \n \"Yes, and I am here in consequence. It cut short my shooting, though.\" \n \n \"I am so sorry--\" \n \n \"Tush; no apologies. The season opened gloriously; but I missed you sorely, Harry, when tramping alone over turnip fields, through miles of beans and yellow stubble, though I had some jolly days of it down in South Wales. Lady Naseby-- \n \n \"She knows nothing of the secret engagement?\" said I, hurriedly and anxiously. \n \n \"Nothing as yet.\" \n \n \"As yet! Must she be told?\" \n \n \"Of course; but I shall make all that right, by-and-by. She believes now in the real character of her attaché, Mr. Guilfoyle, who intruded himself among us, and who has disappeared. Your perfect innocence has been proved alike to her and her daughter, and now you may win at a canter. The photo of you in the locket was abstracted from Winifred\u0027s album, and has her name written on the back of it. You are to ride over with me to Walcot Park, where I have left Winifred, as she refused flatly to come to Winchester--why, I know not. She will afford you an opportunity of slipping the ring again on your fair one\u0027s finger, and doing anything else that may suggest itself at such a time--you comprehend, eh? Winny bluntly asked Lady Naseby\u0027s permission to invite you, as you were so soon to leave England.\" \n \n \"The dear girl! God bless her!\" \n \n \"So say I. Lady Naseby said at first that though you had been maligned, there had also been a contretemps of which even her French maid was cognisant; that she hated all contretemps and so forth; but Winny--you know how sweet the girl is, and how irresistible--carried her point, so you spend this evening there. Tell Evans to have your nag ready within the hour. That fellow is not forgetting his mother-tongue among the Sassenachs. He comes from our namesake\u0027s place, Dolwrheiddiog, \u0027the meadow of the salmon.\u0027 I know it well.\" \n \n \"If I could but meet Guilfoyle--\" I was beginning. \n \n \"Forget him. I cannot comprehend how he found such favour in the sight of Lady Naseby; but when I called him a thoroughbred rascal, she quietly fanned herself, and fondling her beastly little cur said, \u0027My dear Sir Madoc, this teaches us how careful we ought to be in choosing our acquaintance, and how little we really know as to the true character, the inner life and habits of our nearest friends. But our mutual legal adviser Mr. Sharpus always spoke of Mr. Guilfoyle as a man of the greatest probity, and of excellent means.\u0027 \u0027Probably,\u0027 said I; \u0027but I never liked that fellow Sharpus; he always looked like a man who has done something of which he is ashamed, and that is not the usual expression of a legal face.\u0027\" \n \n So poor Winifred Lloyd had been my chief good angel; yet she was the last whom I should have chosen as ambassadress in a love affair of mine. She was a volunteer in the matter, and a most friendly one to boot. Were this a novel, and not \"an owre true tale,\" I think I should have loved Winny; for \"how comes it,\" asks a writer, \"that the heroes of novels seem to have in general a bad taste by their choice of wives? The unsuccessful lady is the one we should have preferred. Rebecca is infinitely more calculated to interest than Rowena.\" \n \n My heart was brimming with joy, and with gratitude to Sir Madoc and his elder daughter; the cloud that overhung me had been exhaled in sunshine, and all again was happiness. I was about to pour forth my thanks to my good old friend, whose beaming and rubicund face was as bright as it could be with pleasure, when there came a sharp single knock on the door of my room. \n \n \"Come in!\" said I, mechanically. \n \n My visitor was the sergeant-major of the dép?t battalion, a tall thin old fellow who had burned powder at Burmah and Cabul, and who instantly raised his hand to his forage-cap, saying, \n \n \"Beg pardon, sir; the adjutant\u0027s compliments--the route has just come for your draft of the Royal Welsh, and all the others, for the East.\" \n \n \"Is this certain!\" asked Sir Madoc, hurriedly. \n \n \"Quite, sir; it will be in orders this evening. They all embark to-morrow at midday.\" \n \n \"Where?\" asked I. \n \n \"At Southampton, as usual. The first bugle will sound after réveil to-morrow.\" \n \n The door closed on my formal visitor, who left me a little bewildered by this sudden sequel to the visit of Sir Madoc, who wrung my hand warmly and said, \n \n \"Heaven bless and protect you, Harry! I feel for you like a son of my own going forth in this most useless war. And so we are actually to lose you, and so soon, too!\" \n \n \"But only for a little time, I hope, Sir Madoc,\" said I, cheerfully, thinking more of my early meeting with Estelle than the long separation the morrow must inevitably bring about. I ordered Evans to pack up and prepare everything, to leave my P.P.C. cards with a few persons I named; and avoiding Price, Clavell, Mostyn, and others, rode with Sir Madoc towards Walcot Park, as my mind somehow foreboded, amid all my joy and excitement, for what I feared would be the last time. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1710/50372.html","bookId":1147,"book":{"id":1147,"title":"Under the Red Dragon","description":"简介： And she is to be there--nay, is there already; so one more chance is given me to meet her.
