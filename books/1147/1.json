{"id":44766,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I.--THE INVITATION.","content":"\"And she is to be there--nay, is there already; so one more chance is given me to meet her. But for what?--to part again silently, and more helplessly bewitched than ever, perhaps. Ah, never will she learn to love me as I love her!\" thought I, as I turned over my old friend\u0027s letter, not venturing, however, to give utterance to this aloud, as the quizzical eyes of Phil Caradoc were upon me. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A penny for your thoughts, friend Harry?\" said he, laughing; \"try another cigar, and rouse yourself. What the deuce is in this letter, that it affects you so? Have you put a pot of money on the wrong horse?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Been jilted, had a bill returned, or what?\" suggested Gwynne. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Neither, fortunately,\" said I; \"it is simply an invitation from Sir Madoc Lloyd, which rather perplexes me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At this time our regiment was then in the East, awaiting with the rest of the army some movement to be made from Varna, either towards Bessarabia or the Crimea--men\u0027s minds were undecided as to which, while her Majesty\u0027s Ministers seemed to have no thought on the subject. Our dep?t belonged to the provisional battalion at Winchester, where Caradoc, Gwynne, two other subalterns, and I, with some two hundred rank and file, expected ere long the fiat of the fates who reign at the Horse Guards to send us forth to win our laurels from the Russians, or, what seemed more probable, a grave where the pest was then decimating our hapless army, in the beautiful but perilous vale of Aladdyn, on the coast of Bulgaria. We had just adjourned from mess, to have a quiet cheroot and glass of brandy-and-water in my quarters, when I received from my man, Owen Evans, the letter the contents of which awakened so many new hopes and tantalising wishes in my heart, and on which so much of my fate in the future might hinge. \\n\\n \\n\\n The bare, half-empty, or but partially-furnished single room accorded by the barrack authorities to me as a subaltern, in that huge square edifice built of old by Charles II. for a royal residence, seemed by its aspect but little calculated to flatter the brilliant hopes in question. Though ample in size, it was far from regal in its appurtenances--the barrack furniture, a camp-bed, my baggage trunks piled in one corner, swords and a gun-case in another, books, empty bottles, cigar-boxes, and a few pairs of boots ostentatiously displayed in a row by Evans, making up its entire garniture, and by very contrast in its meagreness compelling me to smile sadly at myself for the ambitious ideas the letter of my old friend had suggested; and thus, for a minute or so ignoring, or rather oblivious of, the presence of my two companions, my eye wandered dreamily over the far-extended mass of old brick houses and the gray church towers of the city, all visible from the open window, and then steeped in the silver haze of the moonlight. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sipping their brandy-and-water, each with a lighted cheroot between his fingers, their shell-jackets open, and their feet unceremoniously planted on a hard wooden chair, while they lounged back upon another, were Phil Caradoc and Charley Gwynne. The first a good specimen of a handsome, curly-haired, and heedless young Englishman, who shot, fished, hunted, pulled a steady oar, and could keep his wicket against any man, while shining without effort in almost every manly sport, was moreover a finished gentleman and thorough good fellow. Less fashionable in appearance and less dashing in manner, though by no means less soldier-like, Gwynne was his senior by some ten years. He was more grave and thoughtful, for he had seen more of the service and more of the world. Already a gray hair or so had begun to mingle with the blackness of his heavy moustache, and the lines of thought were traceable on his forehead and about the corners of his keen dark-gray eyes; for he was a hard-working officer, who had been promoted from the ranks when the regiment lay at Barbadoes, and was every inch a soldier. And now they sat opposite me, waiting, with a half-comical expression, for farther information as to their queries; and though we were great friends, and usually had few secrets from each other, I began to find that I had one now, and that a little reticence was necessary. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know Sir Madoc\u0027s place in North Wales?\" said I. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course,\" replied Caradoc; \"there are few of ours who don\u0027t. Half the regiment have been there as visitors at one time or other.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, he wishes me to get leave between returns--for even longer if I can--and run down there for a few weeks. \u0027Come early, if possible,\u0027 he adds; \u0027the girls insist on having an outdoor fÃªte, and a lot of nice folks are coming. Winny has arranged that we shall have a regimental band--the Yeomanry one too, probably; then we are to have a Welsh harper, of course, and an itinerant Merlin in the grotto, to tell every one\u0027s fortune, and to predict your promotion and the C.B., if the seer remains sober. While I write, little Dora is drawing up a programme of the dances, and marking off, she says, those which she means to have with you.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Here I paused; but seeing they expected to hear more, for the writer was a friend of us all, I read on coolly, and with an air of as much unconsciousness as I could assume: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lady Estelle Cressingham is with us--by the way, she seems to know you, and would, I think, like to see more of you. She is a very fine girl, though not pure Welsh; but that she cannot help--it is her misfortune, not her fault. We have also a fellow here, though I don\u0027t quite know how he got introduced--Hawkesby Guilfoyle, who met her abroad at Ems, or Baden-Baden, or one of those places where one meets everybody, and he seems uncommonly attentive--so much so, that I wonder her mother permits it; but he seems to have some special power or influence over the old lady, though his name is not as yet, or ever likely to be, chronicled by Burke or Debrett. In lieu of the goat which your regiment lost in Barbadoes, Winifred has a beautiful pet one, a magnificent animal, which she means to present to the Welsh Fusileers. Tell them so. And now, for yourself, I will take no refusal, and Winny and Dora will take none either; so pack your traps, and come off so soon as you can get leave. You need not, unless you choose, bring horses; we have plenty of cavalry here. Hope you will be able to stay till the 12th, and have a shot at the grouse. Meanwhile, believe me, my dear Hardinge, yours, \u0026c., Madoc Meredyth Lloyd.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Kindly written, and so like the jolly style of the old Baronet,\" said Gwynne. \"I have ridden with him once or twice in the hunting-field--on a borrowed mount, of course,\" added poor Charley; who had only his pay, and, being an enthusiast in his profession, was no lounger in the service. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But what is there in all this that perplexes you?\" asked Caradoc, who, I suppose, had been attentively observing me. As he spoke, I coloured visibly, feeling the while that I did so. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The difficulty about leave, perhaps,\" I stammered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll go, of course,\" said Caradoc. \"His place--Craigaderyn Court--is one of the finest in North Wales; his daughters are indeed charming; and you are certain to meet only people of the best style there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yet he seems to doubt this--what is his name?--Guilfoyle, however,\" said I. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What of that? One swallow--you know the adage. I should go, if I had the invitation. His eldest daughter has, I have heard, in her own right, no end of coal-mines somewhere, and many grassy acres of dairy farms in the happy hunting-grounds of the midland counties.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By Jove,\" murmured Gwynne, as he lit a fresh cigar; \"she should be the girl for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I have another inducement than even the fair Winny,\" said I. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oho! Lady--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sir Madoc,\" said I hastily, \"is an old friend of my family, and having known me from infancy, he almost views me as a son. Don\u0027t mistake me,\" I added, reddening with positive annoyance at the hearty laugh my admission elicited; \"Miss Lloyd and I are old friends too, and know each other a deuced deal too well to tempt the perils of matrimony together. We have no draughts ready for the East, nor will there be yet awhile; even our last recruits are not quite licked into shape.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" sighed Gwynne, who had a special charge of the said \"licking into shape.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And so, as the spring drills are over, I shall try my luck with old R----.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The person thus bluntly spoken of was the lieutenant-colonel of the dep?t battalion--one who kept a pretty tight hand over us all in general, and the subalterns in particular. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stay,\" I exclaimed suddenly; \"here is a postscript. \u0027Bring Caradoc of yours with you, and Gwynne, too, if you can. Winny has mastered the duet the former sent her, and is anxious to try it over with him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Caradoc will only be too happy, if the genius who presides over us in the orderly-room is propitious,\" said Phil, colouring and laughing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank Sir Madoc for me, old fellow,\" said Gwynne, half sadly. \"Tell him that the Fates have made me musketry instructor, and that daily I have that \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Delightful task! to rear the tender thought, \\n\\n To teach the young idea how to shoot\u0027-- \\n\\n \\n\\n to set up Taffy and Giles Chawbacon in the Hythe position, and drill them to fire without closing both eyes and blazing in the air.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027In the lawn,\u0027 adds Sir Madoc, \u0027we are to have everything--from waltzing to croquet (which, being an old fellow, and being above insteps and all that sort of thing, I think the slowest game known), and from cliquot and sparkling hock to bottled stout and bitter beer--unlimited flirtation too, according to that wag, Dora.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A tempting bill of fare, especially with two such hostesses,\" said Gwynne; \"but for me to quit Winchester is impossible. Even the stale dodge of \u0027urgent private affairs\u0027 won\u0027t serve me. Such droll ideas of the service old Sir Madoc must have, to think that three of us could leave the dep?t, and all at once too!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall try my luck, however.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I too,\" rejoined Caradoc. \"I am entitled to leave. Price of ours will take my guards for me. Wales will be glorious in this hot month. I did all the dear old Principality last year--went over every foot of Snowdonia, leaving nothing undone, from singing \u0027Jenny Jones\u0027 to dancing a Welsh jig at a harvest-home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you didn\u0027t go over Snowdonia with such a girl as Winifred Lloyd?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, certainly,\" said he, laughing, and almost reddening again. \"Nature, even in my native Wales, must be more charming under such bright auspices and happy influence. So Wales be it, if possible. London, of course, is empty just now, and all who can get out of it will be yachting at Cowes, shooting in Scotland, fishing in Norway, backing the red at Baden-Baden, climbing the Matterhorn, or, it may be, the Peter Botte; killing buffaloes in America, or voyaging up the Nile in canoes. Rotten-row will be a desert, the opera a place of silence and cobwebs; and the irresistible desire to go somewhere and be doing something, no matter what, which inspires all young Britons about this time, renders Sir Madoc\u0027s invitation most tempting and acceptable.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Till the route comes for the East,\" said I. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Potting the Ruskies, and turning my musketry theory into practice, are likely to be my chief relaxations and excitement,\" said Gwynne, with a good-natured laugh, as he applied his hand to the brandy bottle. \"At present I have other work in hand than flirting with countesses, or visiting heiresses. But I envy you both, and heartily wish you all pleasure,\" he added, as he shook hands and left us early, as he had several squads to put through that most monotonous of all drill (shot drill perhaps excepted)--a course of musketry--betimes in the morning. \\n\\n \\n\\n We knew that Gwynne, who was a tall, thin, close-flanked, and square shouldered, but soldier-like fellow, had nothing but his pay; and having a mother to support, he was fain to slave as a musketry instructor, the five shillings extra daily being a great pecuniary object to him. He was very modest withal, and feared that, nathless his red coat and stalwart figure, his chances of an heiress, even in Cottonopolis, were somewhat slender. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1710/50348.html","bookId":1147,"book":{"id":1147,"title":"Under the Red Dragon","description":"ç®ä»ï¼ And she is to be there--nay, is there already; so one more chance is given me to meet her.
