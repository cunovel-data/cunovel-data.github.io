{"id":44772,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII.--PIQUE.","content":"The moment I entered the drawing-room, where Winifred Lloyd had been doing her utmost to amuse her various guests till we came, and where undoubtedly the ladies\u0027 faces grew brighter when we appeared, I felt conscious that the remark of the hoydenish Dora had done me some little mischief. I could read this in the face of the haughty Estelle, together with her fear that others might have heard it; thus, instead of seating myself near her, as I wished and had fully intended, I remained rather aloof, and leaving her almost exclusively to the industrious Guilfoyle, divided my time between listening to Winifred, who, with Caradoc, proceeded to perform the duet he had sent her from the barracks, and endeavouring to make myself agreeable to the Countess--a process rather, I am sorry to say, somewhat of a task to me. Though her dark hair was considerably seamed with gray, her forehead was without a line, smooth and unwrinkled as that of a child--care, thought, reflection, or sorrow had never visited her. Wealth and rank, with a naturally aristocratic indolence and indifference of mind, had made the ways of life and of the world--at least, the world in which she lived--easy, soft, and pleasant, and all her years had glided brilliantly but monotonously on. She had married the late earl to please her family rather than herself, because he was undoubtedly an eligible parti; and she fully expected their only daughter to act exactly in the same docile manner. Her mien and air were stately, reserved, and uninviting; her eyes were cold, inquiring, and searching in expression, and I fancied that they seemed to watch and follow me, as if she really and naturally suspected me of \"views,\" or, as she would have deemed them, designs. Amid the commonplaces I was venturing to utter to this proud, cold, and decidedly unpleasant old dame, whose goodwill and favour I was sedulously anxious to gain, it was impossible for me to avoid hearing some remarks that Sir Madoc made concerning me, and to her daughter. \"I am so glad you like my young friend, Lady Estelle,\" said the bluff baronet, leaning over her chair, his rubicund face beaming with smiles and happiness; for he was in best of moods after a pleasant dinner, with agreeable society and plenty of good wine. \"Who told you that I did so?\" asked she, looking up with fresh annoyance, yet not unmixed with drollery, in her beautiful face. \"Dora and Winny too; and I am so pleased, for he is an especial friend of ours. I love the lad for his dead mother\u0027s sake--she was an old flame of mine in my more romantic days--and doesn\u0027t he deserve it? What do you think the colonel of his old corps says of him?\" \"Really, Sir Madoc, I know not--that he is quite a ladykiller, perhaps; to be such is the ambition of most young subalterns.\" \"Better than that. He wrote me, that young Hardinge is all that a British officer ought to be; that he has a constitution of iron--could sleep out in all weathers, in a hammock or under a tree--till the fever attacked him at least. If provisions were scanty, he\u0027d share his last biscuit with a comrade; on the longest and hottest march he never fell out or became knocked up; and more than once he has been seen carrying a couple of muskets, the arms of those whose strength had failed them. \u0027I envy the Royal Welsh their acquisition, and regret that we have lost him\u0027--these were the colonel\u0027s very words.\" Had I fee\u0027d or begged him to plead my cause, he could not have been more earnest or emphatic. \"For heaven\u0027s sake, Sir Madoc, do stop this overpowering eulogium,\" said I; \"it is impossible for one not to overhear, when one\u0027s own name is mentioned. But did the colonel really say all this of me?\" \"All, and more, Harry.\" \"It should win him a diploma of knight-bachelor,\" said Lady Estelle, laughing, \"a C.B., perhaps a baronetcy.\" \"Nay,\" said Sir Madoc; \"such rewards are reserved now for toad-eaters, opulent traders, tuft-hunters, and ministerial tools; the days when true merit was rewarded are gone, my dear Lady Estelle.\" The duet over, Phil Caradoc drew near me, for evidently he was not making much progress with Miss Lloyd. \"Well, Phil,\" said I, in a low voice, \"among those present have you seen your ideal of woman?\" \"Can\u0027t say,\" said he, rather curtly; \"but you have, at all events, old fellow, and I think Sir Madoc has done a good stroke of business for you by his quotation of the colonel\u0027s letter. I heard him all through our singing--the old gentleman has no idea of a sotto voce, and talks always as if he were in the hunting-field. By Jove, Harry, you grow quite pink!\" he continued, laughing. \"I see how the land lies with you; but as for \u0027la mère Cressingham,\u0027 she is an exclusive of the first water, a match-maker by reputation; and I fear you have not the ghost of a chance with her.\" \"Hush, Caradoc,\" said I, glancing nervously about me \"remember that we are not at Winchester, or inside the main-guard, just now. But see, Lady Estelle and that fellow Guilfoyle are about to favour us,\" I added, as the pale beauty spread her ample skirts over the piano-stool, with an air that, though all unstudied, seemed quite imperial, and ran her slender fingers rapidly over the white keys, preluding an air; while Guilfoyle, who had a tolerable voice and an intolerable amount of assurance, prepared to sing by fussily placing on the piano a piece of music, on the corner of which was written in a large and bold hand, evidently his own--\"To Mr. H. Guilfoyle, from H.S.H. the Princess of Catzenelnbogen.\" \"You must have been a special favourite with this lady,\" said Estelle, \"as most of your German music is inscribed thus.\" \"Yes, we were always exchanging our pieces and songs,\" said he, languidly and in a low voice close to her ear, yet not so low as to be unheard by me. \"I was somewhat of a favourite with her, certainly; but then the Princess was quite a privileged person.\" \"In what respect?\" \"She could flirt farther than any one, and yet never compromise herself. However, when she bestowed this ring upon me, on the day when I saved her life, by arresting her runaway horse on the very brink of the Rhine, I must own that his Highness the Prince was the reverse of pleased, and viewed me with coldness ever after; so that ultimately I resigned my office of attaché, just about the time I had the pleasure--may I call it the joy?--of meeting you.\" \"O fie, Mr. Guilfoyle! were you actually flirting with her?\" \"Nay, pardon me; I never flirt.\" \"You were in love then?\" \"I was never in love till--\" A crash of notes as she resumed the air interrupted whatever he was about to say; but his eye told more than his bold tongue would perhaps have dared to utter in such a time or place; and, aware that they had met on the Continent, and had been for some time together in the seclusion of Craigaderyn, I began to fear that he must have far surpassed me in the chances of interest with her.. Moreover, Dora\u0027s foolish remark might reasonably lead her to suppose that I was already involved with Winifred; and now, with a somewhat cloudy expression in my face (as a mirror close by informed me), and a keen sense of pique in my heart, I listened while she played the accompaniment to his pretty long German song, the burden of which seemed to be ever and always-- \"Ach nein! ach nein! ich darf es nich. Leb wohl! Leb\u0027 wohl! Leb\u0027 wohl!\" Sir Madoc, who had listened with some secret impatience to this most protracted German ditty, now begged his fair guest to favour him with something Welsh; but as she knew no airs pertaining to the locality, she resigned her place to Winifred, whom I led across the room, and by whose side I remained. After the showy performances of Lady Estelle, she was somewhat reluctant to begin: all the more so, perhaps, that her friend--with rather questionable taste, certainly--was wont, in a spirit of mischief or raillery--but one pardons so much in lovely woman, especially one of rank--to quiz Wales, its music and provincialism; just as, when in the Highlands, she had laughed at the natives, and voted \"their sham chiefs and gatherings as delightfully absurd.\" Finding that his daughter lingered ere she began, and half suspecting the cause, Sir Madoc threatened to send for Owen Gwyllim, the butler, with his harp. Owen had frequently accompanied her with his instrument; but though that passed well enough occasionally among homely Welsh folks, it would never do when Lady Naseby and certain others were present. \"It is useless for an English girl to sing in a foreign language, or attempt to rival paid professional artists, by mourning like Mario from the turret, or bawling like Edgardo in the burying-ground, or to give us \u0027Stride la vampa\u0027 in a fashion that would terrify Alboni,\" said Sir Madoc, \"or indeed to attempt any of those operatic effusions with which every hand organ has made us familiar. So come, Winny, a Welsh air, or I shall ring for Owen.\" This rather blundering speech caused Lady Estelle to smile, and Guilfoyle, whose \"Leb\u0027 wohl\" had been something of the style objected to, coloured very perceptibly. Thus urged, Winifred played and sang with great spirit \"The March of the Men of Harlech;\" doubtless as much to compliment Caradoc and me as to please her father; for it was then our regimental march; and, apart from its old Welsh associations, it is one of the finest effusions of our old harpers. Sir Madoc beat time, while his eyes lit up with enthusiasm, and he patted his daughter\u0027s plump white shoulders kindly with his weather-brown but handsome hands; for the old gentleman rather despised gloves, indoors especially, as effeminate. Winifred had striven to please rather than to excel; and though tremulous at times, her voice was most attractive. \"Thank you,\" said I, in a low and earnest tone; \"your execution is just of that peculiar kind which leaves nothing more to be wished for, and while it lasts, Winny, inspires a sense of joy in one\u0027s heart.\" \"You flatter me much--far too much,\" replied Miss Lloyd, in a lower and still more tremulous tone, as she grew very pale; for some girls will do so, when others would flush with emotion, and it was evident that my praise gave her pleasure; she attached more to my words than they meant. An undefinable feeling of pique now possessed me--a sensation of disappointment most difficult to describe; but it arose from a sense of doubt as to how I really stood in the estimation of the fair Estelle. Taking an opportunity, while Sir Madoc was emphatically discussing the points and pedigrees of certain horses and harriers with Guilfoyle and other male friends, while the Countess and other ladies were clustered about Winifred at the piano, and Dora and Caradoc were deep in some affair of their own, I leaned over her chair, and referring--I forget now in what terms--to the last time we met, or rather parted, I strove to effect that most difficult of all moves in the game of love--to lead back the emotions, or the past train of thought, to where they had been dropped, or snapped by mischance, to the time when I had bid her lingeringly adieu, after duly shawling and handing her to the carriage, at the close of a late rout in Park-lane, when the birds of an early June morning were twittering in the trees of Hyde Park, when the purple shadows were lying deep about the Serpentine, when the Ring-road was a solitude, the distant Row a desert, and the yawning footmen in plush and powder, and the usually rubicund coachmen, looking weary, pale, and impatient, and when the time and place were suited neither for delay nor dalliance. Yet, as I have elsewhere said, an avowal of all she had inspired within me was trembling on my lips as I led her through the marble vestibule and down the steps, pressing her hand and arm the while against my side; but her mother\u0027s voice from the depths of the carriage (into which old Lord Pottersleigh had just handed her) arrested a speech to which she might only have responded by silence, then at least; and I had driven, via Piccadilly, to the Junior U.S., when Westminster clock was paling out like a harvest moon beyond the Green Park, cursing my diffidence, that delayed all I had to say till the carriage was announced, thereby missing the chance that never might come again. And then I had but the memory of a lovely face, framed by a carriage window, regarding me with a bright yet wistful smile, and of a soft thrilling pressure returned by an ungloved hand, that was waved to me from the same carriage as it rolled away westward. The night had fled, and there remained of it only the memory of this, and of those glances so full of tenderness, and those soft attentions or half endearments which are so charming, and so implicitly understood, as almost to render language, perhaps, un necessary. \"You remember the night we last met, and parted, in London?\" I whispered. \"Morning, rather, I think it wash\" said she, fanning herself; \"but night or morning, it was a most delightful ball. I had not enjoyed myself anywhere so much that season, and it was a gay one.\" \"Ah, you have not forgotten it, then,\" said I, encouraged. \"No; it stands out in my memory as one night among many happy ones. Day was almost breaking when you led me to the carriage, I remember.\" \"Can you remember nothing more?\u0027 I asked, earnestly. \"You shawled me most attentively--\" \"And I was whispering--\" \"Something foolish, no doubt; men are apt to do so at such times,\" she replied, while her white eyelids quivered and she looked up at me with her calm, bright smile. \"Something foolish!\" thought I, reproachfully; \"and then, as now, my soul seemed on my lips.\" \"Do you admire Mr. Guilfoyle\u0027s singing?\" she asked, after a little pause, to change the subject probably. \"His voice is unquestionably good and highly cultured,\" said I, praising him truthfully enough to conceal the intense annoyance her unexpected question gave me; \"but, by the way, Lady Estelle, how does it come to pass that he has the honour of knowing you--to be here, too?\" \"How--why--what do, you mean, Mr. Hardinge?\" she asked, and I could perceive that after colouring slightly she grew a trifle paler than before. \"He is a visitor here, like you or myself. We met him abroad first; he was most kind to us when mamma lost all her passports at the Berlin Eisenbahnhof, and he accompanied us to the Alte Leipziger Strasse for others, and saw us safely to our carriage. Then, by the most singular chances, we met him again at the new Kursaal of Ems, at Gerolstein, when we were beginning the tour of the Eifel, and at Baden-Baden. Lastly, we met him at Llandudno, on the beach, quite casually, when driving with Sir Madoc, to whom he said that he knew you--that you were quite old friends, in fact.\" \"Knew me, by Jove! that is rather odd. I only lost some money to him; enough to make me wary for the future.\" \"Wary?\" she asked, with dilated eyes. \"Yes.\" \"An unpleasant expression, surely. Sir Madoc, who is so hospitable, asked him here to see the lions of Craigaderyn, and has put a gun at his disposal for the twelfth.\" \"How kind of unthinking Sir Madoc! A most satisfactory explanation,\" said I, cloudily, while gnawing my moustache. Guilfoyle had too evidently followed them. \"If any explanation were necessary,\" was the somewhat haughty response, as the mother-of-pearl fan went faster than ever, and she looked me full in the face with her clear, dark, and penetrating eyes, to the sparkle of which the form of their lids, and their thick fringe of black lash, served to impart a softness that was indeed required. \"Do you know anything of him?\" she added. \"No; that is--\" \"Anything against him?\" \"No, Lady Estelle.\" \"What then?\" she asked, a little petulantly. \"Simply that I, pardon me, think a good deal.\" \"More than you would say?\" \"Perhaps.\" \"This is not just. Mamma is somewhat particular, as you know; and our family solicitor, Mr. Sharpus, who is his legal friend also, speaks most warmly of him. We met him in the best society--abroad, of course; but, Mr. Hardinge, your words, your manner, more than all, your tone, imply what I fear Mr. Guilfoyle would strongly resent. But please go and be attentive to mamma--you have scarcely been near her to-night,\" she added quickly, as a flush of anger crossed my face, and she perceived it. I bowed and obeyed, with a smile on my lips and intense annoyance in my heart. I knew that the soft eyes of Winifred Lloyd had been on us from time to time; but my little flirtation with her was a thing of the past now, and I was reckless of its memory. Was she so? Time will prove. I felt jealousy of Guilfoyle, pique at Lady Estelle, and rage at my own mismanagement. I had sought to resume the tenor of our thoughts and conversation on the occasion of our parting after that joyous and brilliant night in Park-lane, when my name on her engagement card had appeared thrice for that of any one else; but if I had touched her heart, even in the slightest degree, would she have become, as it seemed, almost warm in defence of this man, a waif picked up on the Continent? Yet, had she any deeper interest in him than mere acquaintanceship warranted, would she have spoken of him so openly, and so candidly, to me? Heavens! we had actually been covertly fencing, and nearly quarrelling! Yet, if so, why should she be anxious for me to win the estimation of \"mamma\"? Lady Naseby had been beautiful in her time, and the utter vacuity and calm of her mind had enabled her to retain much of that beauty unimpaired; and I thought that her daughter, though with more sparkle and brilliance, would be sure to resemble her very much at the same years. She was not displeased to meet with attention, but was shrewd enough to see, and disdainful enough to resent, its being bestowed, as she suspected it was in my instance, on account of her daughter; thus I never had much success; for on the night of that very rout in London my attentions in that quarter, and their apparent good fortune, had excited her parental indignation and aristocratic prejudices against me. After all the visitors had withdrawn (as horses or carriages were announced in succession), save one or two fox-hunters whom Guilfoyle had lured into the billiard-room for purposes of his own, when the ladies left us at night Lady Estelle did not give me her hand. She passed me with a bow and smile only, and as she swept through the gilded folding doors of the outer drawing-room, with an arm round Dora\u0027s waist, her backward glances fell on all--but me. Why was this? Was this coldness of manner the result of Guilfoyle\u0027s influence, fear of her mamma, her alleged engagement with old Lord Pottersleigh, pique at myself caused by Dora\u0027s folly, or what? It was the old story of \"trifles light as air.\" I felt wrathful and heavy at heart, and repented bitterly the invitation I had accepted, and the leave I had asked; for Lady Estelle seemed so totally unconcerned and indifferent to me now, considering the empressement with which we had parted in London. The \"family solicitor,\" too! He had been introduced as a mutual friend in the course of affairs--in the course of a friendship that had ripened most wonderfully. Was this Hawkesby Guilfoyle a fool, or a charlatan, or both? His various versions of the diamond ring would seem to show that he was the former. What fancy had the Countess for him, and why was he tolerated by Sir Madoc? Familiar though I was with my old friend, I felt that I could not, without a violation of good taste, ask a question about a guest, especially one introduced by the Cressinghams. His voice was soft in tone; his manner, when he chose, was suave; his laugh at all times, even when he mocked and sneered, which was not unfrequent, silvery and pleasing; yet he was evidently one who could \"smile and smile and be\"--I shall not exactly say what. While smoking a cigar, I pondered over these and other perplexing things in my room before retiring for the night, hearing ever and anon the click of the billiard-balls at the end of the corridor. Had I not the same chance and right of competition as this Guilfoyle, though unknown to the \"family solicitor\"? How far had he succeeded in supplanting me, and perhaps others? for that there were others I knew. How far had he gone in his suit--how prospered? How was I to construe the glances I had seen exchanged, the half speech so bluntly made, and so adroitly drowned at the piano? Who was he? what was he? The attaché of the mock embassy at a petty German Court! Surely my position in society was as good, if not better defined than his; while youth, appearance, health, and strength gave me every advantage over an \"old fogie\" like Viscount Pottersleigh. As if farther to inflame my pique, and confirm the chagrin and irritation that grew within me on reflection, Phil Caradoc, smoothing his moustache, came into my room, which adjoined his, to have, as he said, \"a quiet weed before turning in.\" He looked ruffled; for he had lost money at billiards--that was evident--and to the object of my jealousy, too. \"That fellow Guilfoyle is a thorough Bohemian if ever there was one!\" said he, as he viciously bit off the end of his cigar prior to lighting it, \"with his inimitable tact, his steady stroke at billiards, his scientific whist, his coolness and perfect breeding: yet he is, I am certain, unless greatly mistaken, a regular free-lance, without the bravery or brilliance that appertained to the name of old--a lawless ritter of the gaming-table, and one that can\u0027t even act his part well or consistently in being so. He has been spinning another story about that ring, with which I suppose, like Claude Melnotte\u0027s, we shall hear in time his grandfather, the Doge of Venice, married the Adriatic I am certain,\" continued Caradoc, who was unusually ruffled, \"that though a vainglorious and boasting fellow, he is half knave, half fool, and wholly adventurer!\" \"This is strong language, Phil. Good heavens! do you really think so?\" I asked, astonished to find him so boldly putting my own thoughts into words. \"I am all but convinced of it,\" said he, emphatically. \"But how in such society?\" \"Ah, that is the rub, and the affair of Sir Madoc, and of Lady Naseby, and of Lady Estelle, too, for she seems to take rather more than an interest in him--they have some secret understanding. . By Jove! I can\u0027t make it out at all.\" Caradoc\u0027s strong convictions and unusual bluntness added fuel to my pique and chagrin, and I resolved that, come what might, I would end the matter ere long; and I thought the while of the song of Montrose-- \"He either fears his fate too much, Or his deserts are small, Who dares not put it to the touch, To gain or lose it all!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1710/50354.html","bookId":1147,"book":{"id":1147,"title":"Under the Red Dragon","description":"简介： And she is to be there--nay, is there already; so one more chance is given me to meet her.
