{"id":44781,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XVI.--THE SECRET ENGAGEMENT.","content":"In making a circuit of his farm on the morning after the storm, Farmer Rhuddlan, while traversing a field that was bounded by a strip of the sea shore, on which the ebbing surf still rolled heavily, was very much scared to find lying there, and to all appearance but recently cast up from the ocean, among starfish, weed, and wreck, an officer in full dress, and a lady (in what had been an elegant demi-toilette of blue silk and fine lace), fair and most delicately white, but drenched, sodden, and to all appearance, as he thought, \"dearanwyl--drowned\"--as she was quite motionless, with her beautiful dark hair all dishevelled and matted among the sand. \\n\\n \\n\\n He knew me--in fact, he had known me since boyhood, having caught me many a time in his orchard at Craig Eryri--and thought he recognized the lady. Moreover, he had heard of the search overnight, and lost no time in spurring his fat little cob in quest of succour. Some wondering rustics promptly came from a neighbouring barnyard, and by the time they arrived, Estelle and I had recovered consciousness, and struggled into a sitting position on some stones close by, whence we were beginning to look about us. \\n\\n \\n\\n A benumbed sensation and total lack of power in my right arm warned me that an accident had occurred, and I endeavoured to conceal the circumstance from Estelle, but in vain; for when murmuring some thanks to God for our preservation, she suddenly lifted her face from my breast, and exclaimed, \"You cannot move this arm! You have been hurt, darling! Tell me about it--speak!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think it is broken, Estelle,\" said I, with a smile; for while I felt something almost of pleasure in the conviction that I had undergone this in saving her, thereby giving me a greater title to her interest and sympathy, I could not forget my short leave from Winchester, the war at hand, the regiment already abroad, and the active duties that were expected of me. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Broken?\" she repeated, in a faint voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My sword-arm--on the eve of marching for foreign service. Awkward, isn\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Awkward! O Harry, it is horrible! And all this has occurred through me and my childish folly!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One arm is at your service, dearest, still,\" said I, while placing it round her, and assisting her to rise, as the kind old farmer returned with his people, joyful to find that we were living, after all, and that by assisting us he might in some degree repay Sir Madoc Lloyd a portion of that debt of gratitude which he owed to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n After despatching a mounted messenger to Craigaderyn with tidings of our safety, he had us at once conveyed to his farm-house at Craig Eryri, where dry clothing was given us, and a doctor summoned to attend me. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You knew that we were missing--lost?\" said I. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Too well, sir,\" replied the farmer, as he produced a brandy-bottle from an ancient oak cupboard. \"With all my lads I assisted in the search,\" he continued in Welsh, as he could scarcely speak a word of English. \"A gentleman came here over night with a groom, both mounted, to spread the news of you and a lady having been lost somewhere below the B?d Mynach.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A gentleman mounted--Mr. Caradoc, perhaps?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Caradoc is one of ourselves,\" said the farmer, his keen eyes twinkling; \"this one was a Sassenach--he Sir Madoc gave that lovely ring to, with a diamond as big as a horse-bean, for winning a race at Chester.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, Mr. Guilfoyle.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, sir, that is his name, I believe,\" replied Rhuddlan; and despite the gnawing agony of my arm I laughed outright, for the quondam German attaché would seem to have actually found time to relate something new about his brilliant to the simple old farmer, and while the fate of Lady Estelle was yet a mystery. As for mine, I shrewdly suspected he cared little about that. \\n\\n \\n\\n Attired by the farmer\u0027s wife in the best clothing with which she could provide her, Lady Estelle, pale, wan, and exhausted, was seated near a fire to restore warmth to her chilled frame, while I retired with the medical man, who found my unlucky arm broken above the elbow; fortunately, the fracture was simple, and in no way a compound one. The bones were speedily set, splinted, and bandaged; and clad in a suit provided for me by Farmer Rhuddlan--to wit, a pair of corduroy knee-breeches, a deeply-flapped double-breasted waistcoat, which, from its pattern, seemed to have been cut from a chintz bedcover, so gorgeous were the roses and tulips it displayed, a large loose coat of coarse gray Welsh frieze, with horn buttons larger than crown pieces, each garment \"a world too wide\"--I presented a figure so absurd and novel that Estelle, in spite of all the misery and danger we had undergone, laughed merrily as she held out to me in welcome a hand of marvellous form and whiteness, the hand that was to be mine in the time to come; and I seated myself by her side, while the farmer and his wife bustled about, preparing for the certain arrival of Sir Madoc and others from the Court. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How odd it seems!\" said Estelle, in a low voice, and after a long pause, as she lay back in the farmer\u0027s black-leather elbow chair, where his wife had kindly placed and pillowed her; and while she spoke, her eyes were half closed and her lips were wreathed with smiles; \"engaged to be married--and to you, Harry! I can scarcely\u0027 realise it. Is this the end of all our ballroom flirtations, our Park drives, and gallops in the Row?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nay, not the end of any; but a continuance of them all, I hope.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Scarcely; people don\u0027t flirt after marriage--together, at least. But it will be the end of all mamma\u0027s grand schemes for me. She always hoped I should twine strawberry leaves with my marriage wreath. Heavens, how nearly I was having a wreath of seaweed!\" she added, with a shudder and a little gasping laugh as I kissed her hand. \"O, my poor Harry, with an arm broken, and by my means I shall never forgive myself--never!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Better an arm than if my heart had been broken by your means, Estelle,\" said I, in a low voice. After a little she said calmly and in an earnest tone, while her colour came and went more than once, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We must be secret, secret as we are sincere; and yet such a system is repugnant to me, and to my pride of heart.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Secret, Estelle!\" (How delicious to call her simply Estelle!) \"Why?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is most necessary--yet awhile, at least.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your mamma\u0027s objections?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"More than that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What--more?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By papa\u0027s will mamma has entire control over all her fortune and mine, too, and should I marry without her full approbation and consent, she may bequeath both if she pleases to my cousin Naseby, leaving but a pittance to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But what will not one undergo for love?\" said I, gazing tenderly into her eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n She smiled sadly, but made no response; perhaps she thought of what love might have of luxury on a subaltern\u0027s pay and his \"expectations.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fear not, Estelle,\" said I, \"for your sake our engagement shall be a secret one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n All my doubts and fears had already given place to the confidence of avowed and reciprocated affection, and in the security of that I was blindly happy. How my heart had been wont to throb when I used mentally to imagine the last interview I should have with her ere going forth to the East, with the story of my love untold; leaving her in ignorance, or partially so, of the sweet but subtle link that bound my existence to hers! Now, the love was told; the link had become a tie, and pain of the anticipated parting became all the more keen apparently, and I prospectively reckoned one by one the weeks, the days, yea, almost the hours I might yet spend in the society of Estelle. I was not much given to daydreams or illusions, but, I asked of myself, was not all this most strange if I was not dreaming now? Could it be that, within a few hours--a time so short--Estelle and I had braved such peril together, and that I had achieved her plight, her troth; the promise of her hand; the acknowledgment of her love, and that all was fulfilled; the coveted and dearest object of my secret thoughts and tenderest wishes! \\n\\n \\n\\n Whether our engagement were secret or not mattered little to me now. Assured of her regard, I felt in her presence and society all that calm delight and sense of repose which were so pleasing after my late tumult of anxiety, pique, jealousy, and uncertainty. By chance or some intuition the farmer and his wife left us for a time alone, while waiting the arrival of our friends; and never while life lasts shall I forget the joy of that calm morning spent alone with Estelle in Rhuddlan\u0027s quaint little drawing-room, the windows of which faced the green Denbigh hills, on which the warm August sun shone cheerily; and often did the memory of it come back to me when I was far away, when I was shivering amid the misery of the half-frozen trenches before Sebastopol, or relieving the out pickets, when Inkermann lights were waxing pale and dim as dawn stole over those snow-clad wastes, where so thick lay the graves of men and horses, while the eternal boom and flash went on without ceasing from the Russian bastions and the allied batteries. I felt as if I had gained life anew, and with it Estelle Cressingham. Great, indeed, was the revulsion of feeling after such peril undergone; after a night of such horror and suffering, to sit by her side, to hang over her, inspired to the full by that emotion of tenderness and rapture which no man can feel but once in life, when the first woman he has really loved admits that he has not done so in vain. I placed on her finger--the engaged finger--an emerald-and-diamond ring that I valued highly, as it had once been my mother\u0027s, and in its place took one of hers, a single pearl set in blue-and-gold enamel. The once proud beauty seemed so humble, gentle, and loving now, as she reclined with her head on my shoulder, and looked at me from time to time with a sweet quiet smile in the soft depths of her dark eyes I forgot that she was an earl\u0027s daughter, with a noble dowry and an ambitious mother, and that I was but a sub of the Royal Welsh, with little more than his pay. I forgot that the route for Varna hung over my head like the sword of Damocles; that a separation, certain and inevitable, was hourly drawing closer and closer, though the accident which had occurred might protract it a little now. \\n\\n \\n\\n Estelle Cressingham was a grand creature, certainly. She naturally seemed to adopt statuesque positions, and thus every movement, however careless and unstudied, was full of artistic grace. Even the misshapen garments of Mrs. Evan Rhuddlan could not quite disfigure her. The turn of her head was stately, and at times her glance, quick and flashing, had a pride in it that she was quite unconscious of. She was, as Caradoc had said, \"decidedly a splendid woman--young lady, rather--but of the magnificent order.\" But there were tender and womanly touches, a gentler nature, in the character of Estelle, that lay under the artificial strata of that cumbrous society in which she had been reared. She had many pets at home in London and at Walcot Park--birds and dogs, which she fed with her own hands, and little children, who were her pensioners; and if her nose seemed a proud one, with an aristocratic curve of nostril, her short upper lip would quiver occasionally when she heard a tale of sorrow or cruelty. And now, from our mutual daydream, we were roused by the sound of wheels, of hoofs, and several voices, as some of our friends from the Court arrived. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1710/50363.html","bookId":1147,"book":{"id":1147,"title":"Under the Red Dragon","description":"简介： And she is to be there--nay, is there already; so one more chance is given me to meet her.
