{"id":44814,"no":49,"title":"CHAPTER XLIX.--BETROTHED.","content":"She seemed absorbed in thought as I drew near her, and did not perceive my approach. She was leaning on the carved balustrade of the terrace, and gazing at the sea and the scenery that lay below it, steeped in the brilliance of a clear and frosty moonlight. The snow had entirely departed from the vicinity of Yalta, though its white mantle still covered all the peaks of the Yaila range of mountains. About a mile distant on one side lay the town, its glaring white-walled houses gleaming coldly in the moonshine. A beach was there, with most civilised-looking bathing-machines upon it; for prior to the war, Yalta had been the fashionable watering-place for the ladies of Sebastopol, Bagtcheserai, and Odessa, who were wont there to disport themselves in fantastic costumes, and take headers in the Euxinus Pontus. On the other side were lovely valleys and hills, covered with timber--pine-groves dark and huge as those that overhang the fjords of Norway. \n \n In the distance lay the Black Sea--so called from the dark fogs that so often cover it--sleeping in silver light, its waves in shining ripples rolling far away round the points of Orianda and Maragatsch; and Valerie, absorbed in thought, and her dark eyes fixed apparently on that point where the starry horizon met the distant sea. \n \n She wore an ample jacket or pelisse of snow-white ermine lined with rose-coloured silk, and clasped at the tender throat by a brooch which was a cluster of bright amethysts. A kind of loose silken hood, such as ladies when in full dress may wear in a carriage, was hastily thrown over the masses of her golden hair, which formed a kind of soft framework for her delicately-cut and warmly-tinted face, for the cold air had brought an unwonted colour into her usually pale complexion. Her eyes wore an expression of languor and anxiety. Heaven knows what the girl was thinking of; but as she watched the shining sea I could see her full pink nervous lips curling and quivering, as if with the thoughts that ran through her impulsive mind. And this bright creature might be mine! I had but to ask her, perhaps, and I had not so faint a heart as to lose one so fair for the mere dread of asking her. Yet, as I drew near, the reflection flashed upon my mind that for three days at least she had purposely avoided me. Why was this? Had my love for her been too apparent to others? had I underdone or overdone anything? what had I omitted, or how committed myself? \n \n \"Valerie!\" said I, softly. \n \n She uttered a slight exclamation, as if startled, and then placing her firm, cool, and velvet-like hands confidingly in mine, glanced nervously round her, and more particularly up at the windows of the house. \n \n \"I would speak with you,\" said she, in a half whisper. \n \n \"And I with you, Valerie. O, how I have longed for a moment such as this, when I might again be with you alone!\" \n \n \"But we must not be seen together; and I have but that moment you have so wished for to spare. Come this way--this way, quick; those cypresses in the tubs will shield us from any curious eyes that may lurk at yonder windows.\" \n \n \"O, Valerie!\" I sighed with happiness, and as I passed a hand caressingly over her jacket of ermine I thought vengefully of Tolstoft\u0027s dark hint about hunting that small quadruped in Siberia; and then as I gazed tenderly into her dark and glittering eyes, I could perceive that their long tremulous lashes were matted. \n \n \"Tears--why tears, Valerie?\" \n \n She spoke hurriedly. \"I have most earnestly to apologise to you for much that I heard the Pulkovnick say during dinner; it was indeed horrid--all!\" \n \n \"Much that you have not heard was more horrid still.\" \n \n \"It is unbearable! His wounds or bruises must have exasperated his temper. Yet I cannot speak to him of that which I did not hear, as to do so would appear too much as if you and I had some secret confidences, and Madame Tolstoff, I fear, has hinted at something of this kind already.\" \n \n \"I asked you to marry me, dearest Valerie.\" \n \n \"Yes--vainly,\" said she, with a half-smile on her partly-averted face. \n \n \"Vainly--why?\" \n \n \"Do not press me to say why.\" \n \n \"Could you love me, Valerie?\" \n \n \"I might.\" \n \n \"Might, Valerie?\" (I was never weary of repeating her sweet name; and what meant this admission, if she declined me?) \"You do not doubt my love for you?\" I urged. \n \n \"No, though I fear it is but a passing fancy, born of idleness and the ennui of Yalta.\" \n \n \"Think you, Valerie, that any man could see, and only love you thus? O no, no! But say that you will be mine--that you will come with me to England, where your brother is, or soon shall be--to England, where women are treated with a courtesy and tenderness all unknown in Russia, and where the girl a man loves is indeed as an empress to him, and has his fate in life in her own hands.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t quite understand all this--nor should I listen to it,\" said she, looking me fully in the face, with calm confidence and something of sadness; too. \n \n Her right hand was still clasped in mine, and as I pressed it against my heart, I placed my left arm round her waist, modestly, tenderly, and with a somewhat faltering manner; for she looked so stately, and in her white ermine seemed taller and more ample than usual, a beauty on a large scale and with \"a presence.\" But starting back, she quickly freed herself from my half-embrace, and said, \"Captain Hardinge, you forget yourself!\" \n \n \"Can it be that you receive my tenderness thus?\" said I, reproachfully, and feeling alike disappointed and crestfallen. \"I love you most dearly, Valerie, and implore you to tell me of my future, for on your answer depends my happiness or misery.\" \n \n \"I hope that I am the holder of neither. I did not ask you to love me; and O, I would to Heaven that you had never come to Yalta--that we had never, never met!\" \n \n \"Why--O, why?\" I asked, imploringly. \n \n \"Because I am on the very eve of being married.\" \n \n \"Married!\" I repeated, breathlessly; and then added passionately and hoarsely, \"To whom?\" \n \n \"Colonel Tolstoff, to whom I was betrothed in form by the Bishop of Odessa.\" \n \n Her refusal was really a double-shotted one, and for a moment I was stupefied. Then I said, in a voice I could scarcely have recognised as my own, \n \n \"It was to this tie, and not to a convent, that Volhonski alluded, when hinting that you were set apart from the world?\" \n \n \"Yes. I thank you from my soul for the love you offer me, though it fills me with distress. I pity you; but can do no more. Alas! you have been here only too long.\" \n \n \"Too long, indeed!\" said I, sadly, while bending my lips to her hand; and then hurrying into the house by the picture-gallery, she left me--left me to my own miserable and crushing thoughts, with the additional mortification of knowing that Madame Tolstoff, watchful as a lynx, had overseen and overheard our interview from another angle of the terrace, though she could not understand its nature; but of course she suspected much, and was all aflame for the interests of her suave and amiable son. \n \n However, this was not to be my last moment of tenderness with Valerie. But I was left little time for reflection, as events were now to succeed each other with a degree of speed and brevity equalled only by the transitions and discoveries of a drama on the stage. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1710/50396.html","bookId":1147,"book":{"id":1147,"title":"Under the Red Dragon","description":"简介： And she is to be there--nay, is there already; so one more chance is given me to meet her.
