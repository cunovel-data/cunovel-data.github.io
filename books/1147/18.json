{"id":44783,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII.--GUILFOYLE.","content":"My Lord Pottersleigh and the adventurer Hawkesby Guilfoyle--for an artful, presumptuous, and very singular adventurer he eventually proved to be--could not detect that there was a secret understanding, and still less that there was any engagement, between Lady Estelle and me; yet both were sharp enough to fancy that there was something wrong so far as they were concerned--something understood by us which to them was incomprehensible; and the latter now referred in vain to Baden, Berlin, Catzenelnbogen, and other places where they had met so pleasantly on the Continent. Engaged solemnly and tenderly to Estelle, I had yet the absurd annoyance of beholding Pottersleigh, who was assured of her mother\u0027s countenance and favour (though he would have been a more seemly suitor for herself), and whose years and position gave him perfect confidence, hovering or shambling perpetually about her, absorbing her time if not her attention, mumbling his overstrained compliments into her unwilling ear, touching her hand or tapered arm, and even patting her lovely white shoulders from time to time with his withered paws, and every way giving himself such fatherly and lover-like airs of proprietary oddly mingled that I could with pleasure have punched his aristocratic old head. We frequently laughed at all this even when he was present; for by a glance rather than a word, Estelle could convey to me all she thought and felt. There was something delightful in this secret understanding, this secret community of thought and interest, with one so young and beautiful--more than all, when blended with it was the charm of the most perfect success in a first affair of love; and I thought myself one of the happiest fellows in the world. \\n\\n \\n\\n Superb as her toilettes were at all times, she seemed to make little Babette Pompon take extra pains with them now, and I felt delighted accordingly, for such infinite care seemed to express a desire to please me. Our next departure from the Court was Mr. Hawkesby Guilfoyle, whom Sir Madoc and all his visitors had begun to view with a coolness and disfavour of which the party in question found it convenient to seem quite oblivious; but it reached its culminating point through a very small matter. One day after luncheon we had gone so far as Penmaen Mawr. The four ladies were in the open carriage; I occupied the rumble; Sir Madoc, Lord Pottersleigh, and Guilfoyle were mounted, and we were all enjoying to the fullest extent that glorious combination of marine and mountain scenery peculiar to the Welsh coast; the air was full of ozone and the sky was full of sunshine. We were all happy, and even Winifred seemed in unusually high spirits; as for Dora, she was never otherwise. The well-hung carriage rolled pleasantly along, between the beautiful green hills, past quiet villages and ancient churches, vast yawning slate quarries, green mounds and gray stones that marked where battles had been, with occasional glimpses of the Irish Sea, that stretched away to the dim horizon like a sheet of glittering glass. Estelle, by arrangement, sat with her back to the horses, so that she and I could freely converse with our eyes, from time to time, under the shade of her skilfully-managed parasol. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sir Madoc on this day was peculiarly enthusiastic, and having mounted what the girls called his \"Welsh hobby,\" was disposed to give it full rein. We halted in a little sequestered glen, a lovely spot embosomed among trees, on the southern slope of the hill. The horses were unbitted; Owen Gwyllim had put the champagne\u0027 bottles to cool in a runnel, where their long gilded necks and swollen corks stood invitingly up amid the rich green grass that almost hid the murmuring water. We had come by Caerhun, through an old and little-frequented road, where Sir Madoc insisted on pointing out to us all the many erect old battle-stones by the wayside; for his mind was now full of quaint stories, and the memory of heroes with barbarous names. Thus when Owen uncorked the Cliquot, he drank more than one guttural Welsh toast, and told us how, often in his boyhood, the road had been obstructed for weeks by masses of rock that fell thundering from the mountain above; and in his love of the olden time or detestation of change, I believe he would have preferred such barriers to progress still, rather than have seen the lines of road and rail that now sweep between the mountain and the sea on the way to Holyhead. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was in this dell or glyn,\" said Sir Madoc, as he seated his sturdy figure on the grass, though the ladies did not leave the carriage, \"that Llewellyn ap Jorwerth took prisoner the luckless William de Breas, whom he hanged at Aber, in the time of Henry III.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why did he hang him?\" asked Guilfoyle, holding his glass for Owen to refill it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because he was a handsome fellow, and found too much favour in the eyes of his princess, whom he dragged to the window that she might see his body hanging lifeless on the gibbet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Deuced hard lines,\" said Guilfoyle, laughing. \"I thought he might have been hung because he hadn\u0027t a pedigree, or some other enormity in Welsh eyes.\" As Sir Madoc looked at the speaker his eyes sparkled, for the remark was a singularly gratuitous one. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You English,\" said he, \"laugh at what you are pleased to consider our little weakness in that respect; and yet the best names in the peerage are apt to be deduced from some corporal or sergeant of William\u0027s Norman rabble.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Heavens, papa! when I change my name of Lloyd, I hope it won\u0027t be for that of Mrs. John Smith or Robinson?\" said Dora, merrily, as she heard that Sir Madoc\u0027s tone was sharp. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, but you must admit that these fortuitous circumstances are deemed of small account now; for as Dick Cypher sings, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027A peer and a \u0027prentice now dress much the same, And you can\u0027t tell the difference excepting by name.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know who your friend Dick Cypher may be,\" replied Sir Madoc, quietly, though evidently greatly ruffled, \"but Burke and Debrett record as ancient, names we deem but those of yesterday, and when compared with ours are as the stunted gorsebush to pine or oak--yes, sir! or as the donkey that crops thistles by the wayside when compared to the Arab horse!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"God bless my soul!\" exclaimed Pottersleigh, letting his hat sink farther on the nape of his neck, as he placed his gold glasses on his long thin nose and gazed at Sir Madoc, who tossed an empty bottle into the runnel, and continued:--\"In Wales we have the lines of Kynaston, who descend from Rhodric Mawr, King of all Wales, and the daughter and coheir of the Bloody Wolf; the Mostyns, from the Lord of Abergeleu who founded the eighth noble tribe; the Vaughans, who come from that King Rhodric who married the daughter of Meuric ap Dyfnwall ap Arthur ap Sitsylt, though that was only in the year 800; and we have the Lloyds----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, papa,\" exclaimed Winifred, seeing that Estelle was laughing heartily, \"we cannot listen to more; and I am sure that your muster-roll of terrible names must have quite convinced Mr. Guilfoyle of his error.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If it ever existed--I did but jest,\" said he, bowing and smiling as he turned to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sir Madoc\u0027s gust of patriotic ire passed away at the sound of his daughter\u0027s voice; but from that moment his manner to Guilfoyle underwent a marked change, for he had already more than once contrived to wound him on this his most tender point. So the usually suave and kind old man became very cool to him as they rode homeward; and early that evening Guilfoyle retired to his room, alleging that he had to write letters. \\n\\n \\n\\n After dinner, as we idled for a little time in the smoking-room prior to joining the ladies, Lord Pottersleigh led the conversation gradually back to our evening excursion, and with some hesitation began to speak of Guilfoyle. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You will pardon me, my dear Sir Madoc, for venturing to speak slightingly of any friend of yours; but----\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Guilfoyle is no friend of mine,\" said the other, hastily; \"he dropped among us from the clouds, as it were. When with Lady Naseby I met him on the beach at Llandudno. He had done her some service on the Continent, at Catzeneln--what\u0027s-its-name?--I invited him on the strength of their past acquaintance--that\u0027s all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then, briefly, get rid of him if you can.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you say, Harry?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I say with Lord Pottersleigh.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sir Madoc fidgeted, for his Welsh ideas of hospitality were somewhat shocked by the idea of \"getting rid\" of a guest. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I assure you, Sir Madoc,\" resumed the peer, \"that he is quite out of his place amongst us, quite; and despite his usually assumed suavity--for it is assumed--he lacks intensely l\u0027odeur de la bonne société, though he affects it; and I overheard two of your late guests making some very dubious remarks concerning him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The deuce you did!\" exclaimed Sir Madoc, tossing away his half-smoked cigar. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They spoke quite audibly, as if they cared not who might hear them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who were they?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Officers of the 19th, from Chester. \u0027Guilfoyle!\u0027 I heard that fast boy Clavell exclaim, as if with surprise, to another; \u0027is that fellow, who--\u0027 \u0027The very same.\u0027 \u0027Then how comes he to be a guest here?\u0027 \u0027Just what I was asking of myself, as he is tabooed everywhere. You know they say--\u0027 \u0027They--who?\u0027 \u0027O, that ubiquitous and irresponsible party so difficult to grapple with--that though he was attaché at some German place, he has been in several conspiracies to pigeon young muffs just come of age. There was particularly one poor fellow of ours whom he rooked at Hamburg of every sixpence, and who was afterwards found drowned in the Alster. And lately I have heard that he was proprietor, or part proprietor, of a gaming-hell in Berlin.\u0027 \u0027By Jove!\u0027 exclaimed little Clavell, but can all this be proved?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 \u0027He lays his plans too deeply and surely.\u0027 Then they walked towards the marquee, and I thought I had hear, enough--quite,\" added his lordship, snuffing. \\n\\n \\n\\n Long before Pottersleigh was done, Sir Madoc had blushed purple with stifled rage and mortification. He said, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My lord, you should have mentioned all this instantly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Truth is, I knew not how to approach the subject.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I have introduced this fellow to my daughters, to my friends, and to Craigaderyn! D--n me, I shall choke!\" he exclaimed, as he started from his chair. \"He is deep as Llyn Tegid! I have already lost considerable sums to him at billiards, and I always thought his success at cards miraculous. But an end shall be put to this instantly!--Owen! Owen Gwyllim!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He kicked a spittoon to the other end of the room, rang the bell furiously for the butler, and dashed off a note to Mr. Guilfoyle. It was sufficiently curt and pointed. He expressed \"regret that a gun would not be at his service on the coming 1st of September; but that the carriage would await his orders, for Chester or elsewhere.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Guilfoyle had doubtless been accustomed to meet with affronts such as this. Desiring his baggage to be sent after him, he departed that night with his two horses, his groom (and diamond ring); but, prior to doing so, he had the effrontery to leave P.P.C. cards for Lady Naseby and Estelle, saying that \"he should not forget their kind invitation to Walcot Park;\" and rode off, scheming vengeance on me, to whom he evidently attributed the whole matter, as he informed Owen Gwyllim that he \"would yet repay me, through his solicitor, perhaps, for the interest I had taken in his affairs.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This threw a temporary cloud over our little party, and good Sir Madoc felt a kind of sorrow for Guilfoyle as he surmised how little money he might have in his purse, forgetting that he was proprietor of a pair of horses. To prevent her amour propre being wounded, we most unfortunately did not reveal this man\u0027s real character to Lady Naseby; thus, to Sir Madoc\u0027s hot temper was attributed his sudden departure. \\n\\n \\n\\n Though Lady Estelle was excessively provoked that, through her and her mother, whom his service on the Continent had prejudiced in his favour, and through his alleged acquaintance with me, he had become Sir Madoc\u0027s guest, in a day or two the whole contretemps was forgotten; but I was fated not to have seen or heard the last of Mr. Hawkesby Guilfoyle. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1710/50365.html","bookId":1147,"book":{"id":1147,"title":"Under the Red Dragon","description":"简介： And she is to be there--nay, is there already; so one more chance is given me to meet her.
