{"id":7740,"no":14,"title":"Acknowledgments","content":"　　I am grateful to the many people who believed in these ideas and gave so much of themselves to makethe publication of Lean In possible. My deepest thanks go to my writing partner Nell Scovell. Nell and I have been working together onspeeches, starting with the 2011 Forrestal Lecture at the U.S. Naval Academy, where I first used thephrase “lean in.” When I was considering writing this book, I realized that I was willing to do it only ifNell collaborated with me. Nell responded that she was “not just in, but all in,” which says everythingabout her commitment. She took a break from her work as a television writer/producer and journalistto make this a priority. She put in nights, early mornings, weekends, and holidays to accommodate mylimited schedule. Most of all, she was insistent that we keep searching until we found the right way totalk about these complicated and emotional issues. Nell’s talent with words is matched only by hersense of humor and her unshakable belief that having more women in leadership positions will resultin a fairer and better world. I am grateful to her not just for her expertise and complete dedication, butfor her friendship, which I have come to cherish. Her heart rings true and clear on this book’s everypage. Marianne Cooper also has lived and breathed this book for the past year and a half. As a sociologistat the Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford University and an expert on gender andsocial inequality, Marianne brought her vast knowledge to bear as this book’s lead researcher. She ismeticulous in her approach and has an unparalleled talent for synthesizing research so it is concise,understandable, and convincing. I learned a great deal from her clear thinking, deep insight, andanalytical rigor. This book would not have been written if it were not for Jennifer Walsh. Through the depth of herconviction, the sheer force of her will, and her absolute refusal to take no for an answer, Jenniferconvinced me to write this book. She told me that this process would be an important personal journeyfor me, and she was right. She stayed by my side from beginning to end, providing guidance andencouragement and reminding me at key moments why I was doing this. My editor, Jordan Pavlin, believed in this project so much that she dedicated many hours over manymonths before I fully committed. She was instrumental in helping flesh out the initial ideas and turnthose ideas into outlines and finally into chapters. Jordan never read an anecdote she did not thinkcould be expanded, and she continually pushed me to share more of my experiences and emotions. Ialso owe my deepest gratitude to Sonny Mehta, editor in chief of Knopf, whose unflagging supportkept this project on the fast track. David Dreyer and Eric London were indispensable to the writing of this book. As trusted advisorsand brilliant craftsmen, they pored over each and every draft from the very first to the very last. Theyapplied their impeccable judgment and communications expertise to all matters, from suggestingsweeping structural changes to honing minute details. They always (always) stayed on point, wereable to see issues from multiple angles, and delivered their advice with speed and a sense of humor. Elliot Schrage, Brandee Barker, Sarah Feinberg, Debbie Frost, and especially Ashley Zandy providedinvaluable support and advice. Gina Bianchini, Rachel Thomas, and Debi Hemmeter turned theirpassion for and commitment to this book’s message into establishing the Lean In Community. If you read this book, you know the importance I place on feedback, and I am especially grateful tothe many people who provided it. From the moment I decided to do this, my sister-in-law, AmySchefler, jumped in to help. She sent detailed thoughts on topics I should cover as I was working onthe initial outline, interviewed all her friends, shared her own stories, and read every draft of eachchapter multiple times. Her enthusiasm and passion for this project—as well as her love and support—were truly inspiring. Gloria Steinem has shared her wisdom with me since I was lucky enough to meet her six years ago. My understanding of the challenges that women face owes much to the time she has generously spentwith me. No one has thought about women—and all of humanity—more deeply than Gloria. And sheconsiders every issue with humility, humor, and a profound desire to build a just world. As an activist,her efforts continue to move us all toward the goal of true equality. As a writer, her words oftenprovide the best single-sentence summary on any topic, which is why she is quoted so frequently inthis book. The phrase “internalize the revolution” comes from her and echoes her book Revolutionfrom Within. It is with love and gratitude that I quote her words in these pages. Arianna Huffington has been a constant source of support in every aspect of my life for many years. She sent comments on drafts from all around the world, adding her insight and deep understanding ofcultural trends. Oprah Winfrey encouraged me to focus on my intent for this book. When I washesitant to share something personal, I heard her voice in my head—or in the text messages she sent—reminding me of the power of being authentic. Gene Sperling is one of the busiest people I know, andyet he found the time to write page after page of key suggestions. His ability to cut to the heart of thematter on issues that concern public policy and the problems that affect people from every lifecircumstance is matchless. Mindy Levy, my childhood friend, was visiting with her family when I roped her into looking at achapter. She turned out to be a master of structure and organization, which she then applied to futuredrafts. Mellody Hobson encouraged me to speak from the heart with conviction and confidence. Shesets the example of what it means to be a woman, unapologetically. Karen Kehela Sherwood helpedcrystallize several key ideas, including the “aha” moment of realizing that how women are perceivedwhen negotiating can be used as a negotiation tool. And just as she did for so many of my papers forso many years, my college roommate Carrie Weber stayed up many late nights line editing everysentence. She helped in ways that only someone who is both a dear friend and an accomplished authorcould. Many others generously read drafts and offered thoughts, sometimes under demanding deadlines. Deep thanks to Stephanie Flanders, Molly Graham, Larry Summers, Bill McKibben, Tina Bennett,Scott and Clia Tierney, Amanda McCall, Jami Passer, Michelle Ebersman, Stephen Paul, DianaFarrell, Adam Freed, Phil Deutch, Marne Levine, Joel Kaplan, Eric Antonow, Lorna Borenstein,Marcus Buckingham, Michael Grimes, Anna Fieler, Kim Scott, Kim Jabal, Carole Geithner, DonGraham, Zander Lurie, and Michael Balaoing. Many people contributed to the research that underpins this book. Shelley Correll and LoriMackenzie of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research at Stanford connected me with Marianne,then supported her so that she could dedicate so much time to this project. Mana Nakagawa, a Ph.D. candidate in the International Comparative Education program at Stanford University, did theinternational research needed to make the book relevant for a global audience. Professor DeborahGruenfeld of the Stanford Graduate School of Business started educating me on gender issues morethan five years ago and has been doing it ever since. Kathleen McCartney, dean of the HarvardGraduate School of Education, explained the NICHD study on early child care and child development. Professor Jennifer Aaker of the Stanford Graduate School of Business shared her research on theimportance of setting goals to pursuing happiness. Harvard professor Hannah Riley Bowlesinterrupted her vacation to spend hours on the phone discussing her work on negotiation. ProfessorFrancis Flynn of the Stanford Graduate School of Business walked me step by step through thefindings of his breakthrough Heidi/Howard study. Sharon Meers generously shared all of the researchshe spent years doing for her book Getting to 50/50. Christine Silva, senior director of research atCatalyst, provided important detail on several studies. Kim Parker, senior researcher with the PewSocial \u0026 Demographic Trends project, discussed Pew’s research report on gender and careeraspirations. And special thanks to Phil Garland, vice president of methodology at SurveyMonkey, forhis insightful comments on many drafts as well as assistance with statistical analysis. The team at WME has been on top of every aspect of this book. Ari Emanuel kicked this wholething off by introducing me to Jennifer, and I am grateful for his friendship as well as his ever-amusing and supportive check-in calls. I am indebted to Tracy Fisher, Theresa Brown, Margaret Riley,Kathleen Nishimoto, and Caitlin Moore for all their efforts. The team at Knopf showed remarkablededication and enthusiasm in this process: Tony Chirico, Paul Bogaards, Chris Gillespie, PeterMendelsund, Erinn Hartman, Elizabeth Lindsay, Caroline Bleeke, Katherine Hourigan, and LydiaBuechler. It was a joy to work closely with Ellen Feldman and Amy Ryan, and I grew to depend ontheir precision with words, careful attention to detail, and endless patience. Thank you to DiveshMakan of Iconiq for his organizational and structural help and to Gary Stiffelman of ZiffrenBrittenham for his diligence. I also want to thank Jill Gillett and Chris Sanagustin for their support ofNell’s work on this project. Much appreciation goes to Markus Dohle and Madeline McIntosh ofRandom House for their steadfast belief in this book. A special thanks to all the women and men who reached out to me after my TEDTalk and otherspeeches to share their stories, struggles, and triumphs. I would not have kept talking about thissubject or written this book had it not been for their responses and thoughts. When I neededinspiration, I read and reread their e-mails and letters. I am also indebted to the many people who have given me opportunities and guidance over thecourse of my career. Larry Summers offered to advise my senior thesis, gave me my first job out ofcollege, and has been an important part of my life ever since. Lant Pritchett, my first boss, taught meto look hard at the data and speak the unvarnished truth. Eric Schmidt, Larry Page, Sergey Brin, andOmid Kordestani hired me at Google despite my complete lack of any relevant experience andsupported me throughout my many years working for them. Richard Skolnik, Salim Habayeb, andMaria Clark invited me to join their team in India at the World Bank. Doug Elmendorf helped me starta group for women in economics when I was in college and taught me so much over the course ofmany years. Don Graham, Pat Mitchell, John Doerr, Dan Rosensweig, Michael Lynton, Bob Iger,Howard Schultz, and Bob Rubin have all given me key advice at critical junctures in my career. FredKofman shared his insights on leadership, authenticity, and responsibility. I am lucky to work every day with extraordinary people at Facebook. Camille Hart has worked bymy side for more than ten years. So much of what I am able to do is because of her expertise, greatjudgment, and relentless pursuit of efficiency. My colleagues Chris Cox, Mike Schroepfer, ElliotSchrage, David Ebersman, Ted Ullyot, Libby Leffler, Charlton Gholson, Kelly Hoffman, AnikkaFragodt, Eric Antonow, David Fischer, Lori Goler, and Dan Rose challenge me to live up to their highstandards and provide the friendship and support that makes coming to work every day worthwhile. Mark Zuckerberg gave me the opportunity of a lifetime and has continued to inspire and support meever since. He has taught me by his example to chart my own course and has encouraged me to dowhat I would do if I were not afraid. I am blessed to be surrounded by loving friends through this project and all else. I am so grateful formy childhood friends Eve Greenbarg, Mindy Levy, Jami Passer, Beth Redlich, Elise Scheck, PamSrebrenik, Brook Rose, Merle Safer-stein, and Amy Trachter; and my closest adulthood friends CarrieWeber, Marne Levine, Phil Deutch, Katie and Scott Mitic, Craig and Kirsten Nevill-Manning, AdamFreed, Joel Kaplan, Clia and Scott Tierney, Kim Jabal, Lorna Borenstein, David Lawee, ChamathPalihapitiya, Zander Lurie, Kim Keating, Diana Farrell, Scott Pearson, Lori Talingting, and LarryBrilliant. The boundless support of my family has been the foundation of my life. My deepest gratitude andlove to my parents Adele and Joel Sandberg, my brother David Sandberg, my sister MichelleSandberg, my mother-in-law Paula Goldberg, my siblings-in-law Amy Schefler, Marc Bodnick, andRob and Leslye Goldberg, and my goddaughter Elise Geithner. This book does not just recommend true partnership; it is a product of several true partnerships. Colin Summers, Nell’s husband, slowed down his architecture career to become the primary caregiverfor their children. In twenty years, his encouragement of her career has never faltered. Hiscontributions to this mission included reading many drafts of this book, discussing its contents overcountless meals, and attending several school events alone. Whenever someone suggests that mothersare better suited to raising children, Nell knows in the deepest way possible that fathers can parentwith as much love, devotion, and joy. Scott Saywell, Marianne’s husband, encouraged her to take on this project despite her initialreluctance. When my offer came, she had her own book to write and a second baby with food allergieswho was not sleeping well. Scott insisted they would figure out a way to make it work, thenreorganized his schedule so that it did. He was more than just supportive, he was excited for Marianne. And finally, I want to thank my truly amazing husband, Dave Goldberg. Dave is my best friend,closest advisor, dedicated coparent, and the love of my life. We both knew that my writing this bookwould come primarily at the expense of our time together, and so writing Lean In was as much hisdecision as mine. He supported me every step of the way, as he always does, with patience, greatinsight, humor, and love.
