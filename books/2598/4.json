{"id":97333,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"He lay face-down on the beach at the foot of a small dune, his face turned to one side, the summer sun beating down upon him. The clump of beach-grass at the top of the dune bent its spikes in a stiff breeze, but down here all was calm, with not even a seagull\u0027s cry to break in upon the lulling hush, hush of waves from far down the beach.\n It would be nice, he thought, to run down the beach and splash in the sea, and come back dripping salt water and tasting it on his lips, and for the very briefest of moments be a small boy again in a world with a future. But the sun beat down from a blue sky and his limbs were leaden, and a great drowsiness was upon him.\n Then ... a disturbance. Blown on the breeze to climb the far side of the dune, flapping like a bird with broken wings, a slim book - a child\u0027s exercise book, with tables of weights and measures on the back - flopped down exhausted in the sand before his eyes. Disinterested, he found strength to push it away; but as his fingers touched it so its cover blew open to reveal pages written in a neat if shaky adult longhand.\n He had nothing else to do, and so began to read . . .\n When did it begin? Where? How? Why?\n The Martians we might have expected (they\u0027ve been frightening us long enough with their tales of invasion from outer space) and certainly there have been enough threats from our Comrades across the water. But this?\u0027\n \u0027Any ordinary sort of plague, we would survive. We always have in the past. And as for war: Christ! - when has there not been a war going on somewhere? They\u0027ve irradiated us in Japan, defoliated us in Vietnam, smothered us in DDT wherever we were arable and poured poison into us where we once flowed sweet and clean - and we always bounced right back.\n \u0027Fire and flood - even nuclear fire and festering effluent -have not appreciably stopped us. For\n \"They\" read \"We\", Man, and for \"Us\" read \"the World\", this Earth which once was ours. Yes, there have been strange years, but never a one as strange as this.\n \u0027A penance? The ultimate penance? Or has Old Ma Nature finally decided to give us a hand? Perhaps she\u0027s stood off, watching us try our damnedest for so damned long to exterminate ourselves, and now She\u0027s sick to death of the whole damned scene. \"OK,\" She says, \"have it your own way.\" And She gives the nod to Her Brother, the Old Boy with the scythe. And He sighs and steps forward, and-\n \u0027And it is a plague of sorts; and certainly it is DOOM; and a fire that rages across the world and devours all... Or will that come later? The cleansing flame from which Life\u0027s bright phoenix shall rise again? There will always be the sea. And how many ages this time before something gets left by the tide, grows lungs, jumps up on its feet and walks . . . and reaches for a club?\n \u0027 When did it begin?\n T remember an Irish stoker who came into a bar dirty and drunk. His sleeves were rolled up and he scratched at hairy arms. I thought it was the heat. \"Hot? Damned right, sur,\" he said, \"an\u0027 hotter by far down below - an\u0027 lousy!\" He unrolled a newspaper on the bar and vigorously brushed at his matted forearm. Things fell on to the newsprint and moved, slowly. He popped them with a cigarette. \"Crabs, sur!\" he cried. \"An\u0027 Christ - they suck like crazy!\" \u0027\n \u0027When?\u0027\n \u0027There have always been strange years - plague years, drought years, war and wonder years - so it\u0027s difficult to pin it down. But the last twenty years . . . they have been strange. When, exactly! Who can say? But let\u0027s give it a shot. Let\u0027s start with the \u002770s - say, \u002776? - the drought.\n \u0027There was so little water in the Thames that they said the river was running backwards. The militants blamed the Soviets. New laws were introduced to conserve water. People were taken to court for watering flowers. Some idiot calculated that a pound of excreta could be satisfactorily washed away with six pints of water, and people put bricks in their WC cisterns. Someone else said you could bathe comfortably in four inches of water, and if you didn\u0027t use soap the resultant mud could be thrown on the garden. The thing snowballed into a national campaign to \"Save It!\" - and in October the skies were still cloudless, the earth parched, and imported rainmakers danced and pounded their tom-toms at Stonehenge. Forest and heath fires were daily occurrences and reservoirs became dustbowls. Sun-worshippers drank Coke and turned very brown . . .\n \u0027And finally it rained, and it rained, and it rained. Widespread flooding, rivers bursting their banks, gardens (deprived all summer) inundated and washed away. Millions of tons of water, and not a pound of excreta to be disposed of. A strange year, \u002776. And just about every year since, come to think.\n \u002777, and stories leak out of the Ukraine of fifty thousand square miles turned brown and utterly barren in the space of a single week. Since then the spread has been very slow, but it hasn\u0027t stopped. The Russians blamed \"us\" and we accused \"them\" of testing a secret weapon.\n \"79 and \u002780, and oil tankers sinking or grounding themselves left, right and centre. Miles-long oil slicks and chemicals jettisoned at sea, and whales washed up on the beaches, and Greenpeace, and the Japanese slaughtering dolphins. Another drought, this time in Australia, and a plague of mice to boot. Some Aussie commenting that \"The poor \u0027roos are dying in their thousands - and a few aboes, too . . .\" And great green swarms of aphids and the skies bright with ladybirds.\n \u0027Lots of plagues, in fact. We were being warned, you see?\n \u0027And \u002784! Ah - 1984! Good old George!\n \u0027He was wrong, of course, for it wasn\u0027t Big Brother at all. It was Big Sister - Ma Nature Herself.\n And in 1984 She really started to go off the rails. \u002784 was half of India eaten by locusts and all of Africa down with a mutant strain of beriberi. \u002784 was the year of the poisoned potatoes and sinistral periwinkles, the year it rained frogs over wide areas of France, the year the cane-pest shot sugar beet right up to the top of the crops.\n \u0027And not only Ma Nature but Technology, too, came unstuck in \u002784. The Lake District chemically polluted -permanently; nuclear power stations at Loch Torr on one side of the Atlantic and Long Island on the other melting down almost simultaneously; the Americans bringing back a \"bug\" from Mars (see, even a real Martian invasion); oil discovered in the Mediterranean, and new fast-drilling techniques cracking the ocean floor and allowing it to leak and leak and leak - and even Red Adair shaking his head in dismay. How do you plug a leak two hundred fathoms deep and a mile long? And that jewel of oceans turning black, and Cyprus a great white tombstone in a lake of pitch. \"Aphrodite Rising From The High-Grade.\"\n \u0027Then \u002785 and \u002786; and they were strange, too, because they were so damned quiet! The lull before the storm, so to speak. And then-\u0027\n \u0027Then it was \u002787, \u002788 and \u002789. The American space-bug leaping to Australia and New Zealand and giving both places a monstrous malaise. No one doing any work for six months; cattle and sheep dead in their millions; entire cities and towns burning down because nobody bothered to call out the fire services, or they didn\u0027t bother to come . . . And all the world\u0027s beaches strewn with countless myriads of great dead octopuses, a new species (or a mutant strain) with three rows of suckers to each tentacle; and their stink utterly unbearable as they rotted. A plague of great, fat seagulls. All the major volcanoes erupting in unison. Meteoric debris making massive holes in the ionosphere. A new, killer-cancer caused by sunburn. The common cold cured! - and uncommon leprosy spreading like wildfire through the Western World.\n \u0027And finally-\n \u0027Well, that was \"When?\". It was also, I fancy, \"Where?\" and \"How?\". As to \"Why\" - I give a mental shrug. I\u0027m tired, probably hungry. I have some sort of lethargy - the spacebug, I suppose - and I reckon it won\u0027t be long now. I had hoped that getting this down on paper might keep me active, mentally if not physically. But . . .\n \u0027 Why?\n \u0027Well, I think I\u0027ve answered that one, too.\n \u0027Ma Nature strikes back. Get rid of the human vermin. They\u0027re lousing up your planet! And maybe that\u0027s what gave Her the idea. If fire and flood and disease and disaster and war couldn\u0027t do the trick, well, what else could She do? They advise you to fight fire with fire, so why not vermin with vermin?\n \u0027They appeared almost overnight, five times larger than their immediate progenitors and growing bigger with each successive hatching; and unlike the new octopus they didn\u0027t die; and their incubation period down to less than a week. The superlice. All Man\u0027s little body parasites, all of his tiny, personal vampires, growing in the space of a month to things as big as your fist.\n Leaping things, flying things, walking sideways things. To quote a certain Irishman: \"An\u0027 Christ - they suck like crazy!\"\n \u0027They\u0027ve sucked, all right. They\u0027ve sucked the world to death. New habits, new protections - new immunities and near-invulnerability - to go with their new size and strength. The meek inheriting the Earth? Stamp on them and they scurry away. Spray them with lethal chemicals and they bathe in them. Feed them DDT and they develop a taste for it. \"An\u0027 Christ - they suck like crazy!\"\n \u0027And the whole world down with the creeping, sleeping sickness. We didn\u0027t even want to fight them!\n Vampires, and they\u0027ve learned new tricks. Camouflage . . . Clinging to walls above doors, they look like bricks or tiles. And when you go through the door . . . And their bite acts like a sort of LSD. Brings on mild hallucinations, a feeling of well-being, a kind of euphoria. In the cities, amongst the young, there were huge gangs of \"bug-people!\" My God!\n They use animals, too; dogs and cats - as mounts, to get them about when they\u0027re bloated. Oh, they kill them eventually, but they know how to use them first. Dogs can dig under walls and fences; cats can climb and squeeze through tiny openings; crows and other large birds can fly down on top of things and into places . . .\n \u0027Me, I was lucky - if you can call it that. A bachelor, two dogs, a parakeet and an outdoor aviary. My bungalow entirely netted in; fine wire netting, with trees, trellises and vines. And best of all situated on a wild stretch of the coast, away from mankind\u0027s great masses. But even so, it was only a matter of time.\n \u0027They came, found me, sat outside my house, outside the wire and the walls, and they waited. They found ways in. Dogs dug holes for them, seagulls tore at the mesh overhead. Frantically, I would trap, pour petrol, burn, listen to them pop! But I couldn\u0027t stay awake for ever. One by one they got the birds, leaving little empty bodies and bunches of feathers. And my dogs, Bill and Ben, which I had to shoot and burn. And this morning when I woke up, Peter parakeet.\n \u0027So there\u0027s at least one of them, probably two or three, here in the room with me right now.\n Hiding, waiting for night. Waiting for me to go to sleep. I\u0027ve looked for them, of course, but-\n \u0027Chameleons, they fit perfectly into any background. When I move, they move. And they imitate perfectly. But they do make mistakes. A moment ago I had two hairbrushes, identical, and I only ever had one. Can you imagine brushing your hair with something like that? And what the hell would I want with three fluffy slippers? A left, a right - and a centre?\n ... I can see the beach from my window. And half a mile away, on the point, there\u0027s Carter\u0027s grocery. Not a crust in the kitchen. Dare I chance it? Do I want to? Let\u0027s see, now. Biscuits, coffee, powdered milk, canned beans, potatoes -no, strike the potatoes. A sack of carrots . . .\u0027\n The man on the beach grinned mirthlessly, white lips drawing back from his teeth and freezing there. A year ago he would have expected to read such in a book of horror fiction. But not now.\n Not when it was written in his own hand.\n The breeze changed direction, blew: on him, and the sand began to drift against his side. It blew in his eyes, glazed now and lifeless. The shadows lengthened as the sun started to dip down behind the dunes. His body grew cold.\n Three hairy sacks with pincer feet, big as footballs and heavy with his blood, crawled slowly away from him along the beach . . . \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-coven-of-vampires-necroscope-6/page-4.html","bookId":2598,"book":{"id":2598,"title":"A Coven of Vampires (Necroscope #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Subterranean Press is proud to announce this brand-new edition of Brian Lumley\u0027s most sought after book, A Coven of Vampires, featuring a collection of 13 classic vampire tales: What Dark God?, Back Row, The Strange Years, The Kiss of the Lamia, Recognition, The Thief Immortal, Necros, The Thing From the Blasted Heath, Uzzi, Haggopian, The Picknickers, Zack Phalanx is Vlad the Impaler, and The House of the Temple.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-coven-of-vampires-necroscope-6.jpg","author":"Brian Lumley","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-coven-of-vampires-necroscope-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:55 PM"}}
