{"id":97341,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"This story comes from a long time ago. I was a boy, so that shows how long ago it was. Part of it is from memory, and the rest is a reconstruction built up over the years through times when I\u0027ve given it a lot of thought, filling in the gaps; for I wasn\u0027t privy to everything that happened that time, which is perhaps as well. But I do know that I\u0027m prone to nightmares, and I believe that this is where they have their roots, so maybe getting it down on paper is my rite of exorcism. I hope so.\\n\\n The summers were good and hot in those days, and no use anyone telling me that that\u0027s just an old man speaking, who only remembers the good things; they were better summers! I could, and did, go down to the beach at Harden every day. I\u0027d get burned black by the time school came around again at the end of the holidays. The only black you\u0027d get on that beach these days would be from the coal dust. In fact there isn\u0027t a beach any more, just a sloping moonscape of slag from the pits, scarred by deep gulleys where polluted water gurgles down to a scummy, foaming black sea.\\n\\n But at that time, men used to crab on the rocks when the tide was out, and cast for cod right off the sandbar where the small waves broke. And the receding sea would leave blue pools where we could swim in safety. Well, there\u0027s probably still sand down there, but it\u0027s ten foot deep under the strewn black guts of the mines, and the only pools now are pools of slurry.\\n\\n It was summer when the gypsies came, the days were long and hot, and the beach was still a great drift of aching white sand.\\n\\n Gypsies. They\u0027ve changed, too, over the years. Now they travel in packs, motorized, in vehicles that shouldn\u0027t even be on the roads: furtive and scruffy, long-haired thieves who nobody wants and who don\u0027t much try to be wanted. Or perhaps I\u0027m prejudiced. Anyway, they\u0027re not the real thing any more. But in those days they were. Most of them, anyway . . .\\n\\n Usually they\u0027d come in packets of three or four families, small communities plodding the roads in their intricately painted, hand-carved horse-drawn caravans, some with canvas roofs and some wooden; all brass and black leather, varnished wood and lacquered chimney-stacks, wrinkled brown faces and shiny brown eyes; with clothes pegs and various gew-gaws, hammered trinkets and rings that would turn your fingers green, strange songs sung for halfpennies and fortunes told from the lines in your hand. And occasionally a curse if someone was bad to them and theirs.\\n\\n My uncle was the local doctor. He\u0027d lost his wife in the Great War and never remarried. She\u0027d been a nurse and died somewhere on a battlefield in France. After the war he\u0027d travelled a lot in Europe and beyond, spent years on the move, not wanting to settle. And when she was out of his system (not that she ever was, not really; her photographs were all over the house) then he had come home again to England, to the north-east where he\u0027d been born. In the summers my parents would go down from Edinburgh to see him, and leave me there with him for company through the holidays.\\n\\n This summer in question would be one of the last - of that sort, anyway - for the next war was already looming; of course, we didn\u0027t know that then.\\n\\n \u0027Gypsies, Sandy!\u0027 he said that day, just home from the mine where there\u0027d been an accident. He was smudged with coal dust, which turned his sweat black where it dripped off him, with a pale band across his eyes and a white dome to his balding head from the protection of a miner\u0027s helmet.\\n\\n \u0027Gypsies?\u0027 I said, all eager. \u0027Where?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Over in Slater\u0027s Copse. Seen \u0027em as I came over the viaduct. One caravan at least. Maybe there\u0027ll be more later.\u0027\\n\\n That was it: I was supposed to run now, over the fields to the copse, to see the gypsies. That way I wouldn\u0027t ask questions about the accident in the mine. Uncle Zachary didn\u0027t much like to talk about his work, especially if the details were unpleasant or the resolution an unhappy one. But I wanted to know anyway. \u0027Was it bad, down the mine?\u0027\\n\\n He nodded, the smile slipping from his grimy face as he saw that I\u0027d seen through his ruse. \u0027A bad one, aye,\u0027 he said. \u0027A man\u0027s lost his legs and probably his life. I did what I could.\u0027 Following which he hadn\u0027t wanted to say any more. And so I went off to see the gypsies.\\n\\n Before I actually left the house, though, I ran upstairs to my attic room. From there, through the binoculars Uncle Zachary had given me for my birthday, I could see a long, long way. And I could even see if he\u0027d been telling the truth about the gypsies, or just pulling my leg as he sometimes did, a simple way of distracting my attention from the accident. I used to sit for hours up there, using those binoculars through my dormer window, scanning the land all about.\\n\\n To the south lay the colliery: \u0027Harden Pit\u0027, as the locals called it. Its chimneys were like long, thin guns aimed at the sky; its skeletal towers with their huge spoked wheels turning, lifting or lowering the cages; and at night its angry red coke ovens roaring, discharging their yellow and white-blazing tonnage to be hosed down into mounds of foul-steaming coke.\\n\\n Harden Pit lay beyond the viaduct with its twin lines of tracks glinting in the sunlight, shimmering in a heat haze. From here, on the knoll where Uncle Zachary\u0027s house stood - especially from my attic window - I could actually look down on the viaduct a little, see the shining tracks receding toward the colliery. The massive brick structure that supported them had been built when the collieries first opened up, to provide transport for the black gold, one viaduct out of many spanning the becks and streams of the north-east where they ran to the sea. \u0027Black gold\u0027, they\u0027d called coal even then, when it cost only a few shillings per hundredweight!\\n\\n This side of the viaduct and towards the sea cliffs, there stood Slater\u0027s Copse, a close-grown stand of oaks, rowans, hawthorns and hazelnuts. Old Slater was a farmer who had sold up to the coal industry, but he\u0027d kept back small pockets of land for his and his family\u0027s enjoyment, and for the enjoyment of everyone else in the colliery communities. Long after this whole area was laid to waste, Slater\u0027s patches of green would still be here, shady oases in the grey and black desert.\\n\\n And in the trees of Slater\u0027s Copse . . . Uncle Zachary hadn\u0027t been telling stories after all! I could glimpse the varnished wood, the young shire horse between his shafts, the curve of a spoked wheel behind a fence.\\n\\n And so I left the house, ran down the shrub-grown slope of the knoll and along the front of the cemetery wall, then straight through the graveyard itself and the gate on the far side, and so into the fields with their paths leading to the new coast road on the one side and the viaduct on the other. Forsaking the paths, I forged through long grasses laden with pollen, leaving a smoky trail in my wake as I made for Slater\u0027s Copse and the gypsies.\\n\\n Now, you might wonder why I was so taken with gypsies and gypsy urchins. But the truth is that even old Zachary in his rambling house wasn\u0027t nearly so lonely as me. He had his work, calls to make every day, and his surgery in Essingham five nights a week. But I had no one. With my \u0027posh\u0027 Edinburgh accent, I didn\u0027t hit it off with the colliery boys. Them with their hard, swaggering ways, and their harsh north-eastern twang. They called themselves \u0027Geordies\u0027, though they weren\u0027t from Newcastle at all; and me, I was an outsider. Oh, I could look after myself. But why fight them when I could avoid them? And so the gypsies and I had something in common: we didn\u0027t belong here. I\u0027d played with the gypsies before.\\n\\n But not with this lot.\\n\\n Approaching the copse, I saw a boy my own age and a woman, probably his mother, taking water from a spring. They heard me coming, even though the slight summer breeze off the sea favoured me, and looked up. I waved . . . but their faces were pale under their dark cloth hats, where their eyes were like blots on old parchment. They didn\u0027t seem like my kind of gypsies at all. Or maybe they\u0027d had trouble recently, or were perhaps expecting trouble. There was only one caravan and so they were one family on its own.\\n\\n Then, out of the trees at the edge of the copse, the head of the family appeared. He was tall and thin, wore the same wide-brimmed cloth hat, looked out at me from its shade with eyes like golden triangular lamps. It could only have been a sunbeam, catching him where he stood with the top half of his body shaded; paradoxically, at the same time the sun had seemed to fade a little in the sky. But it was strange and I stopped moving forward, and he stood motionless, just looking.\\n\\n Behind him stood a girl, a shadow in the trees; and in the dappled gloom her eyes, too, were like candle-lit turnip eyes in October.\\n\\n \u0027Hallo!\u0027 I called from only fifty feet away. But they made no answer, turned their backs on me and melted back into the copse. So much for \u0027playing\u0027 with the gypsies! With this bunch, anyway. But ... I could always try again later. When they\u0027d settled in down here.\\n\\n I went to the viaduct instead.\\n\\n The viaduct both fascinated and frightened me at one and the same time. Originally constructed solely to accommodate the railway, with, the addition of a wooden walkway it also provided miners who lived in one village but worked in the other with a shortcut to their respective collieries.\\n\\n On this side, a mile to the north, stood Essingham; on the other, lying beyond the colliery itself and inland a half-mile or so toward the metalled so-called \u0027coast road\u0027, Harden. The viaduct fascinated me because of the trains, shuddering and rumbling over its three towering arches, and scared me because of its vertiginous walkway.\\n\\n The walkway had been built on the ocean-facing side of the viaduct, level with the railway tracks but separated from them by the viaduct\u0027s wall. It was of wooden planks protected on the otherwise open side, by a fence of staves five feet high. Upward-curving iron arms fixed in brackets underneath held the walkway aloft, alone sustaining it against gravity\u0027s unending exertions. But they always looked dreadfully thin and rusty to me, those metal supports, and the vertical distance between them and the valley\u0027s floor seemed a terribly great one. In fact it was about one hundred and fifty feet. Not a terrific height, really, but it only takes a fifth of that to kill or maim a man if he falls.\\n\\n I had an ambition: to walk across it from one end to the other. So far my best attempt had taken me a quarterway across before being forced back. The trouble was the trains. The whistle of a distant train was always sufficient to send me flying, heart hammering, racing to get off the walkway before the train got onto the viaduct! But this time I didn\u0027t even make it that far. A miner, hurrying towards me from the other side, recognised me and called: \u0027Here, lad! Are you the young \u0027un stayin\u0027 with Zach Gardner?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 I answered as he stamped closer. He was in his \u0027pit black\u0027, streaked with sweat, his boots clattering on the wooden boards.\\n\\n \u0027Here,\u0027 he said again, groping in a grimy pocket. \u0027A threepenny bit!\u0027 He pressed the coin into my hand. \u0027Now runGod knows you can go faster than me! Tell your uncle he\u0027s to come at once to Joe Andersen\u0027s. The ambulance men won\u0027t move him. Joe won\u0027t let them! He\u0027s delirious but he\u0027s hangin\u0027 on. We diven\u0027t think for long, though.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The accident man?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Aye, that\u0027s him. Joe\u0027s at home. He says he can feel his legs but not the rest of his body. It\u0027d be reet funny, that, if it wasn\u0027t so tragic. Bloody cages! He\u0027ll not be the last they trap! Now scramble, lad, d\u0027you hear?\u0027\\n\\n I scrambled, glad of any excuse to turn away yet again from the challenge of the walkway.\\n\\n Nowadays... a simple telephone call. And in those days, too, we had the phone; some of us. But Zachary Gardner hated them. Likewise cars, though he did keep a motorcycle and sidecar for making his rounds. Across the fields and by the copse I sped, aware of faces in the trees but not wasting time looking at them, and through the graveyard and up the cobbled track to the flat crest of the knoll, to where my uncle stood in the doorway in his shirtsleeves, all scrubbed clean again. And I gasped out my message.\\n\\n Without a word, nodding, he went to the lean-to and started up the bike, and I climbed slowly and dizzily to my attic room, panting my lungs out. I took up my binoculars and watched the shining ribbon of road to the west, until Uncle Zachary\u0027s bike and sidecar came spurting into view, the banging of its pistons unheard at this distance; and I continued to watch him until he disappeared out of sight toward Harden, where a lone spire stood up, half-hidden by a low hill. He came home again at dusk, very quiet, and we heard the next day how Joe Anderson had died that night.\\n\\n The funeral was five days later at two in the afternoon; I watched for a while, but the bowed heads and the slim, sagging frame of the miner\u0027s widow distressed me and made me feel like a voyeur. So I watched the gypsies picnicking instead.\\n\\n They were in the field next to the graveyard, but separated from it by a high stone wall. The field had lain fallow for several years and was deep in grasses, thick with clovers and wild flowers. And up in my attic room, I was the only one who knew the gypsies were there at all. They had arrived as the ceremony was finishing and the first handful of dirt went into the new grave.\\n\\n They sat on their coloured blanket in the bright sunlight, faces shaded by their huge hats, and I thought: how odd! For while they had picnic baskets with them, they didn\u0027t appear to be eating.\\n\\n Maybe they were saying some sort of gypsy grace first. Long, silent prayers for the provision of their food. Their bowed heads told me that must be it. Anyway, their inactivity was such that I quickly grew bored and turned my attention elsewhere . . .\\n\\n The shock came (not to me, you understand, for I was only on the periphery of the thing, a child, to be seen and not heard) only three days later. The first shock of several, it came first to Harden village, but like a pebble dropped in a still pond its ripples began spreading almost at once.\\n\\n It was this: the recently widowed Muriel Anderson had committed suicide, drowning herself in the beck under the viaduct. Unable to bear the emptiness, still stunned by her husband\u0027s absence, she had thought to follow him. But she\u0027d, retained sufficient of her senses to leave a note: a simple plea that they lay her coffin next to his, in a single grave. There were no children, no relatives; the funeral should be simple, with as few people as possible. The sooner she could be with Joe again the better, and she didn\u0027t want their reunion complicated by crowds of mourners. Well, things were easier in those days. Her grief quickly became the grief of the entire village, which almost as quickly dispersed, but her wishes were respected.\\n\\n From my attic room I watched the gravediggers at work on Joe Anderson\u0027s plot, shifting soil which hadn\u0027t quite settled yet, widening the hole to accommodate two coffins. And later that afternoon I watched them climb out of the hole, and saw the way they scratched their heads. Then they separated and went off, one towards Harden on a bicycle, heading for the viaduct shortcut, and the other coming my way, towards the knoll, coming no doubt to speak with my Uncle Zachary. Idly, I looked for the gypsies then, but they weren\u0027t picnicking that day and I couldn\u0027t find them around their caravan. And so, having heard the gravedigger\u0027s cautious knock at the door of the house, and my uncle letting him in, I went downstairs to the latter\u0027s study.\\n\\n As I reached the study door I heard voices: my uncle\u0027s soft tones and the harsher, local dialect of the gravedigger. but both used so low that the conversation was little more than a series of whispers. I\u0027ve worked out what was said since then, as indeed I\u0027ve worked most things out, and so am able to reconstruct it here:\\n\\n \"Holes, you say?\u0027 That was my uncle.\\n\\n \u0027Aye!\u0027 said the other, with conviction. \u0027In the side of the box. Drilled there, like. Power of them.\u0027 (Power meaning four.)\\n\\n \u0027Wormholes?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bloody big worms, gaffer!\u0027 (Worms sounding like \u0027warms\u0027.) \u0027Big as half-crowns, man, those holes!\\n\\n And anyhow, he\u0027s only been doon a fortneet.\u0027\\n\\n There was a pause before: \u0027And Billy\u0027s gone for the undertaker, you say?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Gone for Mr Forster, aye. I told him, be as quick as you can.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, John,\u0027 (my uncle\u0027s sigh) \u0027while we\u0027re waiting, I suppose I\u0027d better come and see what it is that\u0027s so worried you . . .\u0027\\n\\n I ducked back then, into the shadows of the stairwell. It wasn\u0027t that I was a snoop, and I certainly didn\u0027t feel like one, but it was as well to be discreet. They left the house and I followed on, at a respectful distance, to the graveyard. And I sat on the wall at the entrance, dangling my long skinny legs and waiting for them, sunbathing in the early evening glow. By the time they were finished in there, Mr Forster had arrived in his big, shiny hearse.\\n\\n \u0027Come and see this,\u0027 said my uncle quietly, his face quite pale, as Mr Forster and Billy got out of the car. Mr Forster was a thin man, which perhaps befitted his calling, but he was sweating anyway, and complaining that the car was like a furnace.\\n\\n \u0027That coffin,\u0027 his words were stiff, indignant, \u0027is of the finest oak. Holes? Ridiculous! I never heard anything like it! Damage, more like,\u0027 and he glowered at Billy and John. \u0027Spade damage!\u0027\\n\\n They all trooped back into the graveyard, and I went to follow them. But my uncle spotted me and waved me back.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll be all right where you are, Sandy my lad,\u0027 he said. So I shrugged and went back to the house. But as I turned away I did hear him say to Mr Forster: \u0027Sam, it\u0027s not spade damage. And these lads are quite right. Holes they said, and holes they are - four of them - all very neat and tidy, drilled right through the side of the box and the chips still lying there in the soil. Well, you screwed the lid down, and though I\u0027ll admit I don\u0027t like it, still I reckon we\u0027d be wise to have it open again. Just to see what\u0027s what. Joe wouldn\u0027t mind, I\u0027m sure, and there\u0027s only the handful of us to know about it. I reckon it was clever of these two lads to think to come for you and me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You because you\u0027re the doctor, and because you were closest,\u0027 said Forster grudgingly, \u0027and me because they\u0027ve damaged my coffin!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 John Lane spoke up, \u0027because you built it - your cousin, anyhow - and it\u0027s got holes in it!\u0027\\n\\n And off they went, beyond my range of hearing. But not beyond viewing. I ran as quickly as I could.\\n\\n Back in my attic room I was in time to see Mr Forster climb out of the hole and scratch his head as the others had done before him. Then he went back to his car and returned with a toolkit. Back down into the hole he went, my uncle with him. The two gravediggers stood at the side, looking down, hands stuffed in their trouser pockets. From the way they crowded close, jostling for a better position, I assumed that the men in the hole wee opening the box. But then Billy and John seemed to stiffen a little. Their heads craned forward and down, and their hands slowly came out of their pockets.\\n\\n They backed away from the open grave, well away until they came up against a row of leaning headstones, then stopped and looked at each other. My uncle and Mr Forster came out of the grave, hurriedly and a little undignified, I thought. They, too, backed away; and both of them were brushing the dirt from their clothes, sort of crouched down into themselves.\\n\\n In a little while they straightened up, and then my uncle gave himself a shake. He moved forward again, got down once more into the grave. He left Mr Forster standing there wringing his hands, in company with Billy and John. My binoculars were good ones and I could actually see the sweat shiny on Mr Forster\u0027s thin face. None of the three took a pace forward until my uncle stood up and beckoned for assistance.\\n\\n Then the two gravediggers went to him and hauled him out. And silent, they all piled into Mr Forster\u0027s car which he started up and headed for the house. And of course I would have liked to know what this was all about, though I guessed I wouldn\u0027t be told. Which meant I\u0027d have to eavesdrop again.\\n\\n This time in the study the voices weren\u0027t so hushed; agitated, fearful, even outraged, but not hushed. There were four of them and they knew each other well, and it was broad daylight. If you see what I mean.\\n\\n \u0027Creatures? Creatures?\u0027 My Forster was saying as I crept to the door. \u0027Something in the ground, you say?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Like rats, d\u0027you mean?\u0027 (John, the senior gravedigger.)\\n\\n \u0027I really don\u0027t know,\u0027 said my uncle, but there was that in his voice which told me that he had his suspicions. \u0027No, not rats,\u0027 he finally said; and now he sounded determined, firm, as if he\u0027d come to a decision. \u0027Now look, you two, you\u0027ve done your job and done it well, but this thing mustn\u0027t go any further. There\u0027s a guinea for each of you - from me, my promise - but you can\u0027t say anything about what you\u0027ve seen today. Do you hear?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Whatever you say, gaffer,\u0027 said John, gratefully. \u0027But what\u0027ll you do about arl this? I mean-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Leave it to me,\u0027 my uncle cut him off. \u0027And mum\u0027s the word, hear?\u0027\\n\\n I heard the scraping of chairs and ducked back out of sight. Uncle Zachary ushered the gravediggers out of the house and quickly returned to his study. \u0027Sam,\u0027 he said, his voice coming to me very clear now, for he\u0027d left the door ajar, \u0027I don\u0027t think it\u0027s rats. I\u0027m sure it isn\u0027t.\\n\\n Neither is it worms of any sort, nor anything else of that nature.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s certainly nothing to do with me!\u0027 the other was still indignant, but more shocked than outraged, I thought.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s something to do with all of us, Sam,\u0027 said my uncle. \u0027I mean, how long do you think your business will last if this gets out, eh? No, it has nothing to do with you or the quality of workmanship,\u0027 he continued, very quickly. \u0027There\u0027s nothing personal in it at all. Oh, people will still die here, of course they will - but you can bet your boots they\u0027ll not want to be buried here!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But what on earth is it?\u0027 Forster\u0027s indignation or shock had evaporated; his voice was now very quiet and awed.\\n\\n \u0027I was in Bulgaria once,\u0027 said my uncle. \u0027I was staying at a small village, very tranquil if a little backward, on the border. Which is to say, the Danube. There was a flood and the riverbank got washed away, and part of the local graveyard with it. Something like this came to light, and the local people went very quiet and sullen. At the place I was staying, they told me there must be an \"Obour\" in the village. What\u0027s more, they knew how to find it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027An Obour?\u0027 said Forster. \u0027Some kind of animal?\u0027\\n\\n My uncle\u0027s voice contained a shudder when he answered: The worst possible sort of animal, yes.\u0027\\n\\n Then his chair scraped and he began pacing, and for a moment T lost track of his low-uttered words. But obviously Mr Forster heard them clearly enough.\\n\\n \"Whafl Man, that\u0027s madness! And you a doctor!\u0027\\n\\n My uncle was ever slow to take offence. But I suspected that by now he\u0027d be simmering. \u0027They went looking for the Obour with lanterns in the dark - woke up everyone in the village, in the dead of night, to see what they looked like by lantern light. For the eyes of the Obour are yellow - and triangular!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Madness!\u0027 Forster gasped again.\\n\\n And now my uncle was angry. \u0027Oh, and do you have a better suggestion? So you tell me, Sam Forster. what vou think can tunnel through packed earth and do ... that?\u0027\\n\\n ?But I-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Look at this book,\u0027 my uncle snapped. And I heard him go to a bookshelf, then his footsteps crossing the room to his guest.\\n\\n After a while: \u0027Russian?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Romanian - but don\u0027t concern yourself with the text, look at the pictures!\u0027\\n\\n Again a pause before: \u0027But . . . this is too . . .\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, I know it is,\u0027 said my uncle, before Forster could find the words he sought. \u0027And I certainly hope I\u0027m wrong, and that it is something ordinary. But tell me, can anything of this sort be ordinary?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What will we do?\u0027 Forster was quieter now. \u0027The police?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 (my uncle\u0027s snort.) \u0027Sergeant Bert Coggins and his three flat-foot constables? A more down-to-earth lot you couldn\u0027t ask for! Good Lord, no! The point is, if this really is something of the sort I\u0027ve mentioned, it mustn\u0027t be frightened off. I mean, we don\u0027t know how long it\u0027s been here, and we certainly can\u0027t allow it to go somewhere else. No, it must be dealt with here and now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve an idea. It may be feasible, and it may not. But it certainly couldn\u0027t be considered outside the law, and it has to be worth a try. We have to work fast, though, for Muriel Anderson goes down the day after tomorrow, and it will have to be ready by then. Come on, let\u0027s go and speak to your cousin.\u0027\\n\\n Mr Forster\u0027s cousin, Jack Boulter, made his coffins for him; so I later discovered.\\n\\n \u0027Wait,\u0027 said Forster, as I once more began backing away from the door. \u0027Did they find this . . . this creature, these Bulgarian peasants of yours?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 my uncle answered. \u0027They tied him in a net and drowned him in the river. And they burned his house down to the ground.\u0027\\n\\n When they left the house and drove away I went into the study. On my uncle\u0027s desk lay the book he\u0027d shown to Mr Forster. It was open, lying face down. Curiosity isn\u0027t confined to cats: small girls and boys also suffer from it.\\n\\n Or if they don\u0027t, then there\u0027s something wrong with them.\\n\\n I turned the book over and looked at the pictures. They were woodcuts, going from top to bottom of the two pages in long, narrow panels two to a page. Four pictures in all. with accompanying legends printed underneath. The book was old, the ink faded and the pictures poorly impressed: the text, of course, was completely alien to me.\\n\\n The first picture showed a man, naked, with his arms raised to form a cross. He had what looked to be a thick rope coiled about his waist. His eyes were three-cornered, with radiating lines simulating a shining effect. The second picture showed the man with the rope uncoiled, dangling down loosely from his waist and looped around his feet. The end of the rope seemed frayed and there was some detail, but obscured by age and poor reproduction. I studied this picture carefully but was unable to understand it; the rope appeared to be fastened to the man\u0027s body just above his left hip. The third picture showed the man in an attitude of prayer, hands steepled before him, with the rope dangling as before, but crossing over at knee height into the fourth frame. There it coiled upward and was connected to the loosely clad body of a skeletally thin woman, whose flesh was mostly sloughed away to show the bones sticking through.\\n\\n Now, if I tell my reader that these pictures made little or no sense to me, I know that he will be at pains to understand my ignorance. Well, let me say that it was not ignorance but innocence. I was a boy. None of these things which I have described made any great impression on me at that time. They were all incidents - mainly unconnected in my mind, or only loosely connected - occurring during the days I spent at my uncle\u0027s house; and as such they were very small pieces in the much larger jigsaw of my world, which was far more occupied with beaches, rock pools, crabs and eels, bathing in the sea, the simple but satisfying meals my uncle prepared for us, etc. It is only in the years passed in between, and in certain dreams I have dreamed, that I have made the connections. In short, I was not investigative but merely curious.\\n\\n Curious enough, at least, to scribble on a scrap of my uncle\u0027s notepaper the following words:\\n\\n \u0027Uncle Zachary, Is the man in these pictures a gypsy?\u0027\\n\\n For the one connection I had made was the thing about the eyes. And I inserted the note into the book and closed it, and left it where I had found it - and then promptly forgot all about it, for there were other, more important things to do.\\n\\n It would be, I think, a little before seven in the evening when I left the house. There would be another two hours of daylight, then an hour when the dusk turned to darkness, but I would need only a third of that total time to complete my projected walk. For it was my intention to cross the fields to the viaduct, then to cross the viaduct itself (!) and so proceed into Harden. I would return by the coast road, and back down the half-metalled dene path to the knoll and so home.\\n\\n I took my binoculars with me, and as I passed midway between Slater\u0027s Copse and the viaduct, trained them upon the trees and the gleams of varnished woodwork and black, tarred roof hidden in them. I could see no movement about the caravan, but even as I stared so a figure rose up into view and came into focus. It was the head of the family, and he was looking back at me. He must have been sitting in the grass by the fence, or perhaps upon a tree stump, and had stood up as I focused my glasses. But it was curious that he should be looking at me as I was looking at him.\\n\\n His face was in the shade of his hat, but I remember thinking: / wonder what is going on behind those queer, three-cornered eyes ofhisl And the thought also crossed my mind: I wonder what he must think of me, spying on him so rudely like this]\\n\\n I immediately turned and ran, not out of any sort of fear but more from shame, and soon came to the viaduct. Out on to its walkway I proceeded, but at a slow walk now, not looking down through the stave fence on my left but straight ahead, and yet still aware that the side of the valley was now descending steeply underfoot, and that my physical height above solid ground was increasing with each pace I took. Almost to the middle I went, before thinking to hear in the still, warm evening air the haunting, as yet distant whistle of a train. A train! And I pictured the clattering, shuddering, rumbling agitation it would impart to the viaduct and its walkway!\\n\\n I turned, made to fly back the way I had come . . . and there was the gypsy. He stood motionless, at the far end of the walkway, a tall, thin figure with his face in the shade of his hat, looking in my direction - looking, I knew, at me. Well, I wasn\u0027t going back that way! And now there was something of fear in my flight, but mainly I suspect fear of the approaching train. Whichever, the gypsy had supplied all the inspiration I needed to see the job through to the end, to answer the viaduct\u0027s challenge. And again I ran.\\n\\n I reached the far side well in advance of the train, and looked back to see if the gypsy was still there. But he wasn\u0027t. Then, safe where the walkway met the rising slope once more, I waited until the train had passed, and thrilled to the thought that I had actually done it, crossed the viaduct\u0027s walkway! It would never frighten me again. As to the gypsy: I didn\u0027t give him another thought. It wasn\u0027t him I\u0027d been afraid of but the viaduct, obviously . . .\\n\\n The next morning I was up early, knocked awake by my uncle\u0027s banging at my door. \u0027Sandy?\u0027 he called. \u0027Are you up?\\n\\n I\u0027m off into Harden, to see Mr Boulter the joiner. Can you see to your own breakfast?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I called back, \u0027and I\u0027ll make some sandwiches to take to the beach.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good! Then I\u0027ll see you when I see you. Mind how you go. You know where the key is.\u0027 And off he went.\\n\\n I spent the entire day on the beach. I swam in the tidal pools, caught small crabs for the fishermen to use as bait, fell asleep on the white sand and woke up itchy, with my sunburn already peeling. But it was only one more layer of skin to join many gone the same way, and I wasn\u0027t much concerned. It was late afternoon by then, my sandwiches eaten long ago and the sun beginning to slip; I felt small pangs of hunger starting up, changed out of my bathing costume and headed for home again.\\n\\n My uncle had left a note for me pinned to the door of his study where it stood ajar: Sandy,\\n\\n I\u0027m going back to the village, to Mr Boulter\u0027s yard and then to the Vicarage. I\u0027ll be in about 9.00 p.m. - maybe. See you then, or if you\u0027re tired just tumble straight into bed.\\n\\n - Zach P.S. There are fresh sandwiches in the kitchen!\\n\\n I went to the kitchen and returned munching on a beef sandwich, then ventured into the study. My uncle had drawn the curtains (something I had never before known him to do during daylight hours) and had left his reading lamp on. Upon his desk stood a funny contraption that caught my eye immediately. It was a small frame of rough, half-inch timber off-cuts, nailed together to form an oblong shape maybe eight inches long, five wide and three deep -like a box without top or bottom.\\n\\n It was fitted where the top would go with four small bolts at the corners: these held in position twin cutter blades (from some woodworking machine, I imagined), each seven inches long, which were slotted into grooves that ran down the corners from top edge to bottom edge. Small magnets were set central of the ends of the box, level with the top, and connected up to wires which passed through an entirely separate piece of electrical apparatus and then to a square three-pin plug. An extension cable lay on the study floor beside the desk, but it had been disconnected from the mains supply. My last observation was this: that a three-quarter-inch hole had been drilled through the wooden frame on one side.\\n\\n Well, I looked at the whole set-up from various angles but could make neither head nor tail of it.\\n\\n It did strike me, however, that if a cigar were to be inserted through the hole in the side of the box, and the bolts on that side released, then the cigar\u0027s end would be neatly severed! But my uncle didn\u0027t smoke . . .\\n\\n I experimented anyway, and when I drew back two of the tiny bolts toward the magnets, the cutter on that side at once slid down its grooves like a toy guillotine, thumping onto the top of the desk! For a moment I was alarmed that I had damaged the desk\u0027s finish . . . until I saw that it was already badly scored by a good many scratches and gouges, where apparently my uncle had amused himself doing much the same thing; except that he had probably drawn the bolts mechanically, by means of the electrical apparatus.\\n\\n Anyway, I knew I shouldn\u0027t be in his study fooling about, and so I put the contraption back the way I had found it and returned to the kitchen for the rest of the sandwiches. I took them upstairs and ate them, then listened to my wireless until about 9.00 p.m. - and still Uncle Zachary wasn\u0027t home. So I washed and got into my pyjamas, which was when he chose to return - with Harden\u0027s vicar (the Reverend Fawcett) and Mr Forster, and Forster\u0027s cousin, the joiner Jack Boulter, all in tow. As they entered the house I hurried to show myself on the landing.\\n\\n \u0027Sandy,\u0027 my uncle called up to me, looking a little flustered. \u0027Look, I\u0027m sorry, nephew, but I\u0027ve been very, very busy today. It\u0027s not fair, I know, but-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all right,\u0027 I said. \u0027I had a smashing day! And I\u0027m tired.\u0027 Which was the truth. \u0027I\u0027m going to read for a while before I sleep.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Good lad!\u0027 he called up, obviously relieved that I didn\u0027t consider myself neglected. \u0027See you tomorrow.\u0027 And he ushered his guests into his study and so out of sight. But again he left the door ajar, and I left mine open, so that I could hear something of their voices in the otherwise still night; not everything they said, but some of it. I wasn\u0027t especially interested; I tried to read for a few minutes, until I felt drowsy, then turned off my light. And now their voices seemed to float up to me a little more clearly, and before I slept snatches of their conversation impressed themselves upon my mind, so that I\u0027ve remembered them:\\n\\n \u0027I really can\u0027t say I like it very much,\u0027 (the vicar\u0027s piping voice, which invariably sounded like he was in the pulpit). \u0027But ... I suppose we must know what this thing is.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027 \"Who\",\u0027 (my uncle, correcting him). \u0027Who it is, Paul. And not only know it but destroy it!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But ... a person?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A sort of person, yes. An almost-human being.\u0027\\n\\n Then Mr Forster\u0027s voice, saying: \u0027What bothers me is that the dead are supposed to be laid to rest! How would Mrs Anderson feel if she knew that her coffin . . .\u0027 (fading out).\\n\\n \u0027But don\u0027t you see?\u0027 (My uncle\u0027s voice again, raised a little, perhaps in excitement or frustration.) \u0027She is the instrument of Joe\u0027s revenge!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dreadful word!\u0027 (the vicar.) \u0027Most dreadful Revenge, indeed! You seem to forget, Zachary, that God made all creatures, great, small, and-\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And monstrous? No, Paul, these things have little or nothing to do with God. Now listen, I\u0027ve no lack of respect for your calling, but tell me: if you were to die tomorrow -God forbid - then where would you want burying, eh?\u0027\\n\\n Then the conversation faded a little, or perhaps I was falling asleep. But I do remember Jack Boulter\u0027s voice saying: \u0027Me, Ah\u0027ll wark at it arl neet, if necessary. An\u0027 divvens worry, it\u0027ll look no different from any other coffin. Just be sure you get them wires set up, that\u0027s arl, before two o\u0027clock.\u0027\\n\\n And my uncle answering him: \u0027It will be done, Jack, no fear about that . . .\u0027\\n\\n The rest won\u0027t take long to tell.\\n\\n I was up late, brought blindingly awake by the sun, already high in the sky, striking slantingly in through my window. Brushing the sleep from my eyes, I went and looked out. Down in the cemetery the gravediggers John and Billy were already at work, tidying the edges of the great hole and decorating it with flowers, but also filling in a small trench only inches deep, that led out of the graveyard and into the bracken at the foot of the knoll. John was mainly responsible for the latter, and I focused my glasses on him. There was something furtive about him: the way he kept looking this way and that, as if to be sure he wasn\u0027t observed, and whistling cheerily to himself as he filled in the small trench and disguised his work with chippings. It seemed to me that he was burying a cable of some sort.\\n\\n I aimed my glasses at Slater\u0027s Copse next, but the curtains were drawn in the caravan\u0027s window and it seemed the gypsies weren\u0027t up and about yet. Well, no doubt they\u0027d come picnicking later.\\n\\n I washed and dressed, went downstairs and breakfasted on a cereal with milk, then sought out my uncle - or would have, except that for the first time in my life I found his study door locked. I could hear voices from inside, however, and so I knocked.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027ll be Sandy,\u0027 came my uncle\u0027s voice, and a moment later the key turned in the lock. But instead of letting me in, he merely held the door open a crack. I could see Jack Boulter in there, working busily at some sort of apparatus on my uncle\u0027s desk - a device with a switch, and a small coloured light-bulb - but that was all.\\n\\n \u0027Sandy, Sandy!\u0027 my uncle sighed, throwing up his hands in despair.\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 I smiled, \u0027you\u0027re busy. It\u0027s all right, Uncle, for I only came down to tell you I\u0027ll be staying up in my room.\u0027\\n\\n That caused him to smile the first smile I\u0027d seen on his face for some time. \u0027Well, there\u0027s a bit of Irish for you,\u0027 he said. But then he quickly sobered. \u0027I\u0027m sorry, nephew,\u0027 he told me, \u0027but what I\u0027m about really, is most important.\u0027 He opened the door a little more. \u0027You see how busy we are?\u0027\\n\\n I looked in and Jack Boulter nodded at me, then continued to screw down his apparatus onto my uncle\u0027s desk. Wires led from it through the curtains and out of the window, where they were trapped and prevented from slipping or being disturbed by the lowered sash. I looked at my uncle to see if there was any explanation.\\n\\n \u0027The, er - the wiring!\u0027 he finally blurted. \u0027We\u0027re testing the wiring in the house, that\u0027s all. We shouldn\u0027t want the old place to burn down through faulty wiring, now should we?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, indeed not,\u0027 I answered, and went back upstairs.\\n\\n I read, listened to the wireless, observed the land all about through my binoculars. In fact I had intended to go to the beach again, but there was something in the air: a hidden excitement, a muted air of expectancy, a sort of quiet tension. And so I stayed in my room, just waiting for something to happen. Which eventually it did.\\n\\n And it was summoned by the bells, Harden\u0027s old church bells, pealing out their slow, doleful toll for Muriel Anderson.\\n\\n But those bells changed everything. I can hear them even now, see and feel the changes that occurred. Before, there had been couples out walking: just odd pairs here and there, on the old dene lane, in the fields and on the paths. And yet by the time those bells were only half-way done the people had gone, disappeared, don\u0027t ask me where. Down in the graveyard, John and Billy had been putting the finishing touches to their handiwork, preparing the place, as it were, for this latest increase in the Great Majority; but now they speeded up, ran to the tiled lean-to in one tree-shaded corner of the graveyard and changed into clothes a little more fitting, before hurrying to the gate and waiting there for Mr Forster\u0027s hearse. For the bells had told everyone that the ceremony at Harden church was over, and that the smallest possible cortege was now on its way. One and a half miles at fifteen miles per hour, which meant a journey of just six minutes.\\n\\n Who else had been advised by the bells, I wondered?\\n\\n I aimed my binoculars at Slater\u0027s Copse, and . . . they were there, all four, pale figures in the trees, their shaded faces turned toward the near-distant spire across the valley, half-hidden by the low hill. And as they left the cover of the trees and headed for the field adjacent to the cemetery, I saw that indeed they had their picnic baskets with them: a large one which the man and woman carried between them, and a smaller one shared by their children. As usual.\\n\\n The hearse arrived, containing only the coffin and its occupant, a great many wreaths and garlands, and of course the Reverend Fawcett and Mr Forster, who with John and Billy formed the team of pallbearers. Precise and practised, they carried Muriel Anderson to her grave where the only additional mourner was Jack Boulter, who had gone down from the house to join them. He got down into the flower-decked hole (to assist in the lowering of the coffin, of course) and after the casket had gone down in its loops of silken rope finally climbed out again, assisted by John and Billy. There followed the final service, and the first handful of soil went into the grave.\\n\\n Through all of this activity my attention had been riveted in the graveyard; now that things were proceeding towards and end, however, I once again turned my glasses on the picnickers. And there they sat cross-legged on their blanket in the long grass outside the cemetery wall, with their picnic baskets between them. But motionless as always, with their heads bowed in a sort of grace.\\n\\n They sat there - as they had sat for Joe Anderson, and Mrs Jones the greengrocer-lady, and old George Carter the retired miner, whose soot-clogged lungs had finally collapsed on him - offering up their silent prayers or doing whatever they did.\\n\\n Meanwhile, in the graveyard:\\n\\n At last the ceremony was over, and John and Billy set to with their spades while the Reverend Fawcett, Jack Boulter and Mr Forster climbed the knoll to the house, where my uncle met them at the door. I heard him greet them, and the Vicar\u0027s high-pitched, measured answer:\\n\\n \u0027Zach, Sam here tells me you have a certain book with pictures? I should like to see it, if you don\u0027t mind. And then of course there\u0027s the matter of a roster. For now that we\u0027ve initiated this thing I suppose we must see it through, and certainly I can see a good many long, lonely nights stretching ahead.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Come in, come in,\u0027 my uncle answered. \u0027The book? It\u0027s in my study. By all means come through.\u0027\\n\\n I heard this conversation, as I say, but nothing registered - not for a minute or two, anyway.\\n\\n Until-\\n\\n There came a gasping and a frantic clattering as my uncle, with the Reverend Fawcett hot on his heels, came flying up the stairs to the landing, then up the short stairs to my room. They burst in, quite literally hurling the door wide, and my uncle was upon me in three great strides.\\n\\n \u0027Sandy,\u0027 he gasped then, \u0027what\u0027s all this about gypsies?\u0027 I put my glasses aside and looked at him, and saw that he was holding the sheet of notepaper with my scribbled query. He gripped my shoulder. \u0027Why do you ask if the man in these pictures is a gypsy?\u0027\\n\\n Finally I knew what he was talking about. \u0027Why, because of their eyes!\u0027 I answered. Their three-cornered eyes.\u0027 And as I picked up my binoculars and again trained them on the picnickers, I added: \u0027But you can\u0027t see their faces from up here, because of their great hats . . .\u0027\\n\\n My uncle glanced out of the window and his jaw dropped. \u0027Good Lord!\u0027 he whispered, eyes bulging in his suddenly white face. He almost snatched the glasses from me, and his huge hands shook as he put them to his eyes. After a moment he said, \u0027My God, my God!\u0027 Simply that; and then he thrust the glasses at the Reverend Fawcett.\\n\\n The Reverend was no less affected; he said, \u0027Dear Jesus! Oh my dear sweet Jesus! In broad daylight! Good heavens, Zach - in broad daylight]\u0027\\n\\n Then my uncle straightened up, towered huge, and his voice was steady again as he said: \u0027Their shirts - look at their shirts!\u0027\\n\\n The vicar looked, and grimly nodded. \u0027Their shirts, yes.\u0027\\n\\n From the foot of the stairs came Jack Boulter\u0027s sudden query: \u0027Zach, Reverend, are you up there?\\n\\n Zach, why man ar\u0027m sorry, but there must be a fault. Damn the thing, but ar\u0027m getna red light!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fault?\u0027 cried my uncle, charging for the door and the stairs, with the vicar right behind him.\\n\\n There\u0027s no fault, Jack! Press the button, man - press the button^\\n\\n Left alone again and not a little astonished, I looked at the gypsies in the field. Their shirts?\\n\\n But they had simply pulled them out of their trousers, so that they fell like small, personal tents to the grass where they sat. Which I imagined must keep them quite cool in the heat of the afternoon. And anyway, they always wore their shirts like that, when they picnicked.\\n\\n But what was this? To complement the sudden uproar in the house, now there came this additional confusion outside! What could have startled the gypsies like this? What on earth was wrong with them? I threw open the window and leaned out, and without knowing why, found my tongue cleaving to the roof of my mouth as once more, for the last time, I trained my glasses on the picnickers. And how to explain what I saw then? I saw it, but only briefly, in the moments before my uncle was there behind me, clapping his hand over my eyes, snatching the window and curtains shut, prising the glasses from my half-frozen fingers. Saw and heard it!\\n\\n The gypsies straining to their feet and trying to run, overturning their picnic baskets in their sudden frenzy, seeming anchored to the ground by fat white ropes which lengthened behind them as they stumbled outward from their blanket. The agony of their dance there in the long grass, and the way they dragged on their ropes to haul them out of the ground, like strangely hopping blackbirds teasing worms; their terrified faces and shrieking mouths as their hats went flying; their shirts and dresses billowing, and their unbelievable screams. All four of them, screaming as one, but shrill as a keening wind, hissing like steam from a nest of kettles, or lobsters dropped live into boiling water, and yet cold and alien as the sweat on a dead fish!\\n\\n And then the man\u0027s rope, incredibly long and taut as a bowstring, suddenly coming free of the ground - and likewise, one after another, the ropes of his family - and all of them living things that writhed like snakes and sprayed crimson from their raw red ends!\\n\\n But all glimpsed so briefly, before my uncle intervened, and so little of it registering upon a mind which really couldn\u0027t accept it - not then. I had been aware, though, of the villagers where they advanced inexorably across the field, armed with the picks and shovels of their trade (what? Ask John and Billy to keep mum about such as this? Even for a guinea?). And of the gypsies spinning like dervishes, coiling up those awful appendages about their waists, then wheeling more slowly and gradually crumpling exhausted to the earth; and of their picnic baskets scattered on the grass, all tumbled and . . . empty.\\n\\n I\u0027ve since discovered that in certain foreign parts \u0027Obour\u0027 means \u0027night demon\u0027, or \u0027ghost\u0027, or \u0027vampire\u0027. While in others it means simply \u0027ghoul\u0027. As for the gypsies: I know their caravan was burned out that same night, and that their bones were discovered in the ashes. It hardly worried me then and it doesn\u0027t now, and I\u0027m glad that you don\u0027t see nearly so many of them around these days; but of course I\u0027m prejudiced.\\n\\n As they say in the north-east, a burden shared is a burden halved. But really, my dreams have been a terrible burden, and I can\u0027t see why I should continue to bear it alone.\\n\\n This then has been my rite of exorcism. At least I hope so ... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-coven-of-vampires-necroscope-6/page-12.html","bookId":2598,"book":{"id":2598,"title":"A Coven of Vampires (Necroscope #6)","description":"Storyline: Subterranean Press is proud to announce this brand-new edition of Brian Lumley\u0027s most sought after book, A Coven of Vampires, featuring a collection of 13 classic vampire tales: What Dark God?, Back Row, The Strange Years, The Kiss of the Lamia, Recognition, The Thief Immortal, Necros, The Thing From the Blasted Heath, Uzzi, Haggopian, The Picknickers, Zack Phalanx is Vlad the Impaler, and The House of the Temple.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-coven-of-vampires-necroscope-6.jpg","author":"Brian Lumley","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-coven-of-vampires-necroscope-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:25:55 PM"}}
