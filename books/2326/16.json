Isn\u0027t that what they say?\" \"That\u0027s what they say.\" \"So your cells and my cells had never met before. I never understood that, the cells changing every seven years. What the hell does it mean? If you get a scar you\u0027ve still got it several years later.\" \"Or a tattoo. The cells change but the ink stays between them.\" \"How does it know how to do that?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"That\u0027s what I can\u0027t figure out. How does it know? You don\u0027t have any tattoos, do you?\" \"No.\" \"And you call yourself an alcoholic. Isn\u0027t that when people get them, when they\u0027re tanked?\" \"Well, it never struck me as the reasoned act of a sober man.\" \"No, I wouldn\u0027t think so. I read somewhere that a high percentage of murderers are heavily tattooed. Have you ever heard that?\" \"It sounds familiar.\" \"I wonder why that would be. Something to do with self-image?\" \"Maybe.\" \"Did Motley have any?\" \"Self-image?\" \"Tattoos, you dimwit.\" \"Sorry. Did he have any tattoos? I don\u0027t remember. You ought to know, you saw more of his body than I did.\" \"Thanks for reminding me. I don\u0027t remember any tattoos. He had scars on his back. Did I tell you about that?\" \"Not that I remember.\" \"Bands of scar tissue across his back. He was probably physically abused in childhood.\" \"It happens.\" \"Uh-huh. Are you sleepy?\" \"Sort of.\" \"And I\u0027m not letting you doze off. That\u0027s the thing about fucking, it wakes women up and puts men to sleep. You\u0027re an old bear and I won\u0027t let you hibernate.\" \"Ummmmm.\" \"I\u0027m glad you don\u0027t have any tattoos. I\u0027ll let you alone now. Good night, baby.\" I slept, and sometime during the night I awoke. I was dreaming, and then the dream had slipped away beyond recall and I was awake. Her body was drawn close to mine and I could feel her heat, and I was breathing her smell. I ran a hand along her flank, feeling the wonderful smoothness of her skin, and the suddenness of my own physical response surprised me. I filled my hands with her and stroked her, and after a moment she made a sound not unlike a cat\u0027s purr and rolled onto her back, shifting to accommodate me. I eased onto her and into her and our bodies found their rhythm and labored together, endlessly rocking. Afterward she laughed softly, in the darkness. I asked her what was so funny. \" \u0027Repeatedly,\u0027 \" she said. In the morning I slipped out of bed and showered and dressed, then woke her to let me out and lock up after me. She wanted to make sure I had the sketch. I held up the cardboard core from a roll of paper towels, Galindez\u0027s effort coiled within. \"Don\u0027t forget I want it back,\" she said. I told her I\u0027d take good care of it. \"And of yourself,\" she said. \"Promise?\" I promised. I walked back to my hotel. On the way I found a copy shop that hadn\u0027t closed for the weekend and got them to run a hundred copies of the sketch. I dropped most of them in my room, along with the original, which I\u0027d rolled and reinserted in its cardboard sleeve. I kept a dozen or so copies and took along a batch of business cards, the ones Jim Faber had printed up for me, not the ones from Reliable. These had my name and phone number, nothing else. I took the Broadway local uptown and got off at Eighty-sixth. My first stop was the Bretton Hall, Motley\u0027s last known address at the time of his arrest. I already knew he wasn\u0027t registered there under his own name, but I tried his picture on the man behind the desk. He studied it solemnly and shook his head. I left the picture with him, along with one of my cards. \"Be something in it for you,\" I said. \"If you can help me out.\" I worked my way up the east side of Broadway to 110th Street, hitting the residential hotels on Broadway itself and on the side streets. Then I crossed to the other side and did the same thing, working my way back down to Eighty-sixth and continuing on down to around Seventy-second Street. I stopped for a plate of black beans and yellow rice at a Cuban-Chinese lunch counter, then worked the east side of Broadway back up to where I\u0027d started. I passed out more business cards than pictures, but I still managed to get rid of all but one of the copies of the sketch and wished I\u0027d brought more. They\u0027d only cost me a nickel apiece, and at that rate I could have afforded to paper the city with them. A couple of people told me Motley looked familiar. At one welfare hotel, the Benjamin Davis on Ninety-fourth, the clerk knew him immediately. \"He was here,\" he said. \"Man stayed here this summer.\" \"What dates?\" \"I don\u0027t know as I could say. He was here more than a couple weeks, but I couldn\u0027t tell you when he came or when he moved out.\" \"Could you check your records?\" \"I might could, if I recollected his name.\" \"His real name\u0027s James Leo Motley.\" \"You don\u0027t always get real names here. I don\u0027t suppose I have to tell you that.\" He flipped to the front of the register, but the volume only went back to early September. He went into a back room and came back with the preceding volume in hand. \"Motley,\" he said to himself, and started paging through the entries. \"I don\u0027t see it here. I got to say I don\u0027t think that was the name he used. I disremember his name, but I would know it if I heard it, you know what I\u0027m saying? And when I hear Motley it don\u0027t ring no bells.\" He went through the book all the same, running his finger down the pages slowly, moving his lips slightly as he scanned the names of lodgers. The whole process drew some attention, and a couple of others, tenants or hangers-on, drifted over to see what was occupying us. \"You know this man,\" the clerk said to one of them. \"Stayed here over the summer. What was the name he called hisself?\" The man he\u0027d asked took the sketch and held it so the light fell on it. \"This ain\u0027t a photograph,\" he said. \"This is like a picture somebody drawn of him.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Yeah, I know him,\" he said. \"Looks just like him. What name was you calling him?\" \"Motley. James Leo Motley.\" He shook his head. \"Wasn\u0027t no Motley. Wasn\u0027t no James anything.\" He turned to his friend. \"Rydell, what was this dude\u0027s name? You remember him.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" Rydell said. \"So what was his name?\" \"Looks just like him,\" Rydell said. \"On\u0027y his hair was different.\" \"How?\" \"Short,\" Rydell told me. \"Short on top, on the sides, short all over.\" \"Real short,\" his friend agreed. \"Like maybe he used to be someplace where they give you a real short haircut.\" \"Where they just use that old clippers,\" Rydell said, \"and all\u0027s they do is buzz you up one side of your head and down the other. I swear I\u0027d know his name. If I was to hear it I\u0027d know it.\" \"So would I,\" the other man said. \"Coleman,\" Rydell said. \"Wasn\u0027t Coleman.\" \"No, but it was like Coleman. Colton? Copeland!\" \"Think you\u0027re right.\" \"Ronald Copeland,\" Rydell said triumphantly. \"Reason I said Coleman, you know that actor, used to be, name of Ronald Colman? Dude here was Ronald Copeland.\" And, amazingly, his name was in the book, with a check-in date of July 27, twelve days after he cleared the gate at Dannemora. For previous address he\u0027d put Mason City, Iowa. I couldn\u0027t imagine why, but I dutifully noted it in my notebook. They had an odd system of record-keeping at the Benjamin Davis, and there was no indication in the book of his date of departure. The clerk had to consult a card file to find that out. It turned out he\u0027d been there exactly four weeks, checking out on the twenty-fourth of August. He had not left a forwarding address, and the desk clerk couldn\u0027t recall that there\u0027d been anything that needed forwarding, or that he\u0027d received any mail during his stay, or had any callers. None of them could recall a conversation with him. \"Man kept to hisself,\" Rydell said. \"Time you\u0027d see him, he\u0027d be going to his room or out to the street. What I\u0027m saying, he was never just standing around talking to you.\" His friend said, \"Something about him, you didn\u0027t start up no conversation with him.\" \"Way he looked at you.\" \"Hell, yes.\" \"He could look at you,\" Rydell said, \"and it was like you\u0027d get a chill. Not a hard look, neither, or a dirty look. Just cold.\" \"Ice-cold.\" \"Like he\u0027d kill you for any reason at all. You want my opinion, man\u0027s a stone killer. I didn\u0027t never know nobody looked at you like that and wasn\u0027t.\" \"I knew a woman once had that kind of look,\" his friend said. \"Shit, I don\u0027t want to meet no woman like that.\" \"You didn\u0027t want to meet this one,\" his friend said. \"Not on the shortest day of your life.\" We talked some more, and I gave them each a card and told them it would be worth something to know where he was now, or if he turned up again in the neighborhood. Rydell offered the opinion that the conversation we\u0027d just had ought to be worth something already, and I wasn\u0027t inclined to argue the point. I gave ten dollars to each of them, him and his friend and the desk clerk. Rydell allowed as to how it might have been worth more than that, but he didn\u0027t seem surprised when that was all he got. \"You see those dudes on the TV,\" he said, \"and they be passing out twenty dollars here, twenty dollars there, \u0027fore nobody even tells \u0027em anything. Why is it you never see no dudes like that around here?\" \"They spend all their money,\" his friend said, \"before they get this far uptown. This gentleman here, this gentleman\u0027s a man knows how to pace hisself.\" I paced myself all up and down Broadway, and that was the only time I had occasion to hand out any money. It was also as close as I came to getting a lead, and I suppose it was progress of a sort. I could place him with certainty in New York for four weeks ending August 24. I had an alias for him, and had the inferential evidence that he was dirty. If he was clean, what did he need with an alias? More important, I\u0027d established that Galindez\u0027s drawing was recognizably close to Motley\u0027s present appearance. His hair had been shorter, but by now his prison haircut would have grown out. Then too, he might have sideburns or facial hair, but he very likely didn\u0027t; he hadn\u0027t had them before he went away, and he hadn\u0027t started growing them by the time he checked out of the Davis, six weeks after they let him out of prison. By the time I made the circle back to the Bretton Hall my legs were feeling the mileage. And that was the least of it. That kind of legwork takes its toll. You have the same conversation with dozens of people, and most of the time it\u0027s like talking to plants. The only bright spot that day had come at the Benjamin Davis, with a long dry spell before it and a longer drier one after. That was typical. When you make rounds like that- knocking on doors, cops call it, but on this occasion I\u0027d had no doors to knock on- when you do this, you know you\u0027re wasting at a minimum ninety-five percent of your time and effort. There doesn\u0027t seem to be any way around this, because you can\u0027t do the useful five percent without the other. It\u0027s like shooting birds with a scattergun. Most of the pellets miss, but you don\u0027t mind as long as the bird falls. And you couldn\u0027t expect to bring him down with a.22. He\u0027s too small, and there\u0027s too much sky around him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-ticket-to-the-boneyard-matthew-scudder-8/page-16.html","bookId":2326,"book":{"id":2326,"title":"A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8)","description":"Storyline: A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8) The streets of New York are never safe, but the release of James Leo Motley, a psychopath who went down swearing revenge on Matt Scudder on all who knew him, means death is out there looking for a victim.
