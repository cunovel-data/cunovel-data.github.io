{"id":63364,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"When he left Elaine closed the door after him and engaged all the locks. \"I feel silly doing this,\" she said, \"but I\u0027ve been doing it anyway.\" \"There are people all over town with half a dozen locks on every door, and alarm systems and everything else. And they don\u0027t have somebody who\u0027s threatened to kill them.\" \"I suppose it\u0027s comforting to know that,\" she said. \"He\u0027s a nice kid, Ray. I wonder if he\u0027ll stay a cop.\" \"Hard to say.\" \"Was there ever anything else you wanted to be? Besides a cop?\" \"I never even wanted to be a cop. It was something I drifted into, and before I was out of the Academy I realized it was what I\u0027d been born for. But I never knew that early on. When I was a kid I wanted to be Joe DiMaggio when I grew up, but that\u0027s what every kid wanted, and I never had the moves to go with the desire.\" \"You could have married Marilyn Monroe.\" \"And sold coffee makers on television. There but for the grace of God.\" She carried our empty glasses into the kitchen and I trailed along behind her. She rinsed them under the tap, placed them in the strainer. \"I think I\u0027m getting stir-crazy,\" she said. \"What are you doing tonight? Do you have anyplace you have to be?\" I looked at my watch. I usually go to St. Paul \u0027s on Fridays for the eight-thirty step meeting, but it was too late now, they\u0027d already started. And I had caught a noon meeting downtown already that day. I told her I didn\u0027t have anything planned. \"Well, how about a movie? How does that sound?\" It sounded fine. We walked over to Sixtieth and Third to a first-run house. It was the weekend so there was a line, but there was a pretty decent film at the end of it, a slick caper movie with Kevin Costner and Michelle Pfeiffer. \"She\u0027s not really pretty,\" Elaine said afterward, \"but there\u0027s something about her, isn\u0027t there? If I were a man, I\u0027d want to fuck her.\" \"Repeatedly,\" I said. \"Oh, she does it for you, huh?\" \"She\u0027s all right.\" \" \u0027Repeatedly,\u0027 \" she said, and chuckled. Around us, Third Avenue was thronged with young people who looked as though the country were every bit as prosperous as the Republicans kept telling us it was. \"I\u0027m hungry,\" Elaine announced. \"You want to get a bite? My treat.\" \"Sure, but why is it your treat?\" \"You paid for the movie. Can you think of a place? Friday night in this neighborhood, wherever we go we\u0027re going to be up to our tits in yuppies.\" \"There\u0027s a place in my neighborhood. Great hamburgers and cottage fries. Oh, wait a minute. You don\u0027t eat hamburgers, do you? The fish is good there, but I forget if you said you eat fish.\" \"Not anymore. How\u0027s their salad?\" \"They serve a good salad, but is that enough for you?\" She said it would be plenty, especially if she stole a few of my cottage fries. There were no empty cabs and the streets were full of people trying to hail one. We started to walk, then caught a bus on Fifty-seventh Street and got off at Ninth Avenue. The place I had in mind, Paris Green, was five blocks downtown. The bartender, a lanky fellow with a brown beard that hung down like an oriole\u0027s nest, gave a wave as we cleared the threshold. His name was Gary, and he\u0027d helped me out a few months ago when I\u0027d been hired to find a girl who\u0027d done some of her drinking there. The manager, whose name was Bryce, had been a little less helpful then, but he was helpful enough now, greeting us with a smile and showing us to a good table. A waitress with a short skirt and long legs came over to take our drink order, went away, and came back with Perrier for me and a Virgin Mary for Elaine. I must have been watching the girl\u0027s departure, because Elaine tapped my glass with hers and advised me to stick to Michelle Pfeiffer. \"I was just thinking,\" I said. \"I\u0027m sure you were.\" When the girl returned Elaine ordered the large garden salad. I had what I generally have there, a Jarlsberg cheeseburger and well-done fries. When the food came I had what felt like dйjа vu until I realized I was getting echoes of Tuesday night, when I\u0027d had a late bite at Armstrong\u0027s with Toni. The two restaurants weren\u0027t that much alike, and neither were the women. Maybe it was the cheeseburgers. Halfway through mine I thought to ask her if it bothered her that I was eating a cheeseburger. She looked at me as though I were crazy and asked why it should bother her. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"You don\u0027t eat meat, and I just wondered.\" \"You must be kidding. Not eating meat is just a choice I make, that\u0027s all. My doctor didn\u0027t order me to quit, and it wasn\u0027t an addiction I had to struggle with.\" \"And you don\u0027t have to go to the meetings?\" \"What meetings?\" \"Carnivores Anonymous.\" \"What a thought,\" she said, and laughed. Then her eyes narrowed and she looked appraisingly at me. \"Is that what you did? AA?\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"I thought that was probably how you did it. Matt, would it have bothered you if I\u0027d ordered a drink?\" \"You did.\" \"Right, a Virgin Mary. Would it have-\" \"You know what the British call it? Instead of a Virgin Mary?\" \"A Bloody Shame.\" \"Right. No, it wouldn\u0027t have bothered me if you\u0027d ordered a real drink. You can order one now if you want.\" \"I don\u0027t.\" \"Is that why you ordered a Virgin Mary? Because you thought it might bother me otherwise?\" \"It didn\u0027t even occur to me, as a matter of fact. I hardly ever drink alcohol these days. I hardly ever did. The only reason I asked was because you asked about the cheeseburger, and while we\u0027ve been discussing meat and drink I\u0027ve been sneaking your cottage fries.\" \"While my attention was diverted elsewhere. We could probably arrange to get you some of your own.\" She shook her head. \"Stolen sweets are best,\" she said. \"Didn\u0027t your mother ever tell you that?\" She wouldn\u0027t let me take the check, and then rejected my suggestion that we split it. \"I invited you,\" she said. \"Besides, I owe you money.\" \"How do you figure that?\" \"Ray Galindez. I owe you a hundred bucks.\" \"The hell you do.\" \"The hell I don\u0027t. Some maniac\u0027s trying to kill me and you\u0027re protecting me. I ought to be paying your regular rate, you know that?\" \"I don\u0027t have a regular rate.\" \"Well, I ought to be paying you what a client pays. I certainly ought to be covering the expenses. Speaking of which, you flew to Cleveland and back, you stayed over at a hotel-\" \"I can afford it.\" \"I\u0027m sure you can, but so what?\" \"And I\u0027m not just acting on your behalf,\" I went on. \"I\u0027m his target at least as much as you are.\" \"You think so? He\u0027s probably a lot less likely to fuck you in the ass.\" \"You never know what he learned in prison. I\u0027m serious, Elaine. I\u0027m operating in my own interest here.\" \"You\u0027re also acting in mine. And it\u0027s depriving you of income, you already said how you\u0027re not working at the detective agency in order to make time for this. If you\u0027re contributing your time, the least I can do is cover all the expenses.\" \"Why don\u0027t we split them?\" \"Because that\u0027s not fair. You\u0027re the one running around, you\u0027re the one putting your regular work on the shelf for the duration. Besides, I can afford it better than you can. Don\u0027t pout, for Christ\u0027s sake, it\u0027s no reflection on your manhood, it\u0027s just a simple statement of fact. I\u0027ve got a lot of money.\" \"Well, you earned it.\" \"Me and Smith Barney, making our money the old-fashioned way. I earned it and I kept it and I invested it, and I\u0027m not rich, honey, but I\u0027ll never be poor. I own a lot of property. I own my apartment, I bought right away when the building went co-op, and I own houses and multiple dwellings in Queens. Jackson Heights, mostly, and some in Woodside. I get checks every month from the management company, and every now and then my accountant tells me I\u0027ve got too big a balance in my money-market account and I have to go out and buy another piece of property.\" \"A woman of independent means.\" \"You bet your ass.\" She paid the check. On the way out we stopped at the bar and I introduced her to Gary. He wanted to know if I was working on a case. \"He let me play Watson once,\" he told Elaine. \"Now I live in hope of another opportunity.\" \"One of these days.\" He draped his long body over the bar, dropped his voice low. \"He brings suspects here for grilling,\" he confided. \"We grill them over mesquite.\" She rolled her eyes and he apologized. We got out of there, and she said, \"God, it\u0027s glorious out, isn\u0027t it? I wonder how long this weather can last.\" \"As long as it wants, as far as I\u0027m concerned.\" \"It\u0027s hard to believe it\u0027s something like six weeks until Christmas. I don\u0027t feel like going home. Is there someplace else we can go? That we can walk to?\" I thought for a moment. \"There\u0027s a bar I like.\" \"You go to bars?\" \"Not usually. The place I\u0027m thinking of is kind of lowlife. The owner- I was going to say he was a friend of mine, but that may not be the right word.\" \"Now you\u0027ve got me intrigued,\" she said. We walked over to Grogan\u0027s. We took a table, and I went over to the bar to get our drinks. They don\u0027t have waiters there. You fetch what you want yourself. The fellow behind the stick was called Burke. If he had a first name, I\u0027d never heard it. Without moving his lips he said, \"If you\u0027re looking for the big fella, he was just here. I couldn\u0027t say if he\u0027ll be back or not.\" I brought two glasses of club soda back to the table. While we nursed them I told her a couple of stories about Mick Ballou. The most colorful one involved a man named Paddy Farrelly, who\u0027d done something to arouse Ballou\u0027s ire. Then one night Ballou went in and out of every Irish saloon on the West Side. He was carrying a bowling bag, so they said, and he kept opening it to show off Paddy Farrelly\u0027s disembodied head. \"I heard that story,\" Elaine said. \"Wasn\u0027t there something about it in the papers?\" \"I think one of the columnists used it. Mick refuses to confirm or deny. In any event, Farrelly\u0027s never been seen since.\" \"Do you think he did it?\" \"I think he killed Farrelly. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any real question of that. I think he went around showing off a bowling bag. I don\u0027t know for sure that he ever opened it, though, or that there was anything in it.\" She thought it over. \"Interesting friends you have,\" she said. Before our club soda ran out, she got a chance to meet him. He came in with two much smaller men in tow, two men dressed alike in jeans and leather flier\u0027s jackets. He gave me a slight nod as he led the two the length of the room and through a door at the rear. Some five minutes later the three reappeared. The two smaller men walked on out of the bar and headed south on Tenth Avenue, and Ballou stopped at the bar, then came over to our table with a glass of twelve-year-old Jameson in his hand. \"Matthew,\" he said. \"Good man.\" I pointed to a chair but he shook his head. \"I can\u0027t,\" he said. \"I have business. The man who\u0027s his own boss always winds up working for a slavedriver.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-ticket-to-the-boneyard-matthew-scudder-8/page-14.html","bookId":2326,"book":{"id":2326,"title":"A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8)","description":"Storyline: A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8) The streets of New York are never safe, but the release of James Leo Motley, a psychopath who went down swearing revenge on Matt Scudder on all who knew him, means death is out there looking for a victim.
