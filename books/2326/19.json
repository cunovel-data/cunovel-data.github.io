Why the hell should I have to defend myself?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" I picked up my coffee cup, but it was empty. I put it down again and picked up a piece of cheese and put that down, too. I said, \"So you already had your B-12 today.\"\\n\\n For a moment she didn\u0027t say anything, and I had time to regret the line. Then she said, \"No as a matter of fact I didn\u0027t, because that\u0027s not what we did. Why? Would you like to know what we did?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you anyway. We did what we always do. I sat on his face and he ate me while he jerked himself off. That\u0027s what he likes, that\u0027s what we always do when he comes over here.\"\\n\\n \"Stop it.\"\\n\\n \"Why the hell should I? What else would you like to know? Did I come? No, but I faked it, that\u0027s what gets him over the edge. Anything else you\u0027d like for me to tell you? You want to know how big his cock was? And don\u0027t you dare hit me, Matt Scudder!\"\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t going to hit you.\"\\n\\n \"You wanted to.\"\\n\\n \"I never even raised my hand, for God\u0027s sake.\"\\n\\n \"You wanted to.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. And I wanted you to. Not to hit me, but to want to.\" Her eyes were huge, brimming with tears at their corners. Softly, wonderingly, she said, \"What\u0027s the matter with us? Why are we doing this to each other?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"I do,\" she said. \"We\u0027re mad, that\u0027s why. You\u0027re mad at me because I\u0027m still a whore. And I\u0027m pissed off at you because you didn\u0027t send me flowers.\"\\n\\n She said, \"I think I know what happened. We\u0027ve been under a strain, both of us. I think it\u0027s made us more vulnerable than we realized. And we wound up casting each other in roles we couldn\u0027t play. I thought you were Sir Galahad and I don\u0027t know who you got me mixed up with.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know either. Maybe the Lady of Shalott.\"\\n\\n She looked at me.\\n\\n \"How does the poem go? \u0027Elaine the fair, Elaine the lovable, Elaine, the lily maid of Astolat.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"Stop it.\"\\n\\n The sky had gone dark outside her window. Above the lights of Queens I saw the winking red lights of an airplane making its approach to land at La Guardia.\\n\\n After a moment she said, \"We read that in high school. Tennyson. I used to pretend it was about me.\"\\n\\n \"You told me once.\"\\n\\n \"Did I?\" Her gaze turned inward as she took a long look at an old memory. Then, crisply, she said, \"Well, I\u0027m no lily maid, baby, and your armor\u0027s lost its shine. And it was Sir Lancelot the Lady of Shalott was hung up on, not Sir Galahad, and we\u0027re not either of them. All we are is two people who always liked each other and always did each other some good. That\u0027s not the worst thing in the world, is it?\"\\n\\n \"I never thought so.\"\\n\\n \"And now we\u0027ve got a crazy man who wants to kill us, so it\u0027s the wrong time for either of us to get kinky. Agreed?\"\\n\\n \"Agreed.\"\\n\\n \"So let\u0027s get the money part handled. Can we do that?\"\\n\\n We could and did. I figured out my expenses to date and she reminded me of some I\u0027d forgotten, then rounded the figure upward and cut off my arguments with a sharp glance. She went into the bedroom and came back with a handful of fifties and hundreds. I watched as she counted out two thousand dollars and shoved the stack across the table at me.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t reach for it. \"That\u0027s not the number you mentioned,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I know. Matt, you really shouldn\u0027t have to keep track of what you lay out, and you shouldn\u0027t have to come back to ask me for more money. Take this, and when it starts running thin tell me and I\u0027ll give you more. Please don\u0027t argue. Money\u0027s what I\u0027ve got, and I damn well earned it, and if you can\u0027t use it at a time like this, what\u0027s the point of having it.\"\\n\\n I picked up the money.\\n\\n \"Good,\" she said. \"That\u0027s settled. I don\u0027t know about the emotional part. I was always better at the business side. I think we\u0027ll just have to play it by ear and take it a day at a time. What do you think?\"\\n\\n I got to my feet. \"I think I\u0027ll have one more cup of coffee,\" I said, \"and then I\u0027ll get out of here.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to.\"\\n\\n \"Yes I do. I want to go play detective and spend some of the money you gave me. I think you\u0027re right, I think we\u0027ll play it by ear. I\u0027m sorry about before.\"\\n\\n \"So am I.\"\\n\\n When I came back with the coffee she said, \"Jesus, I\u0027ve got six messages on my machine.\"\\n\\n \"When did the calls come? When we were in bed?\"\\n\\n \"Must have. Is it all right if I play them back?\"\\n\\n \"Why shouldn\u0027t it be?\"\\n\\n She shrugged and pressed the appropriate button. There was a whirring sound, some background noise, then a click. \"A hang-up,\" she said. \"That\u0027s what I get most of the time. A lot of people don\u0027t like to leave a message.\"\\n\\n There was another hang-up. Then a man said, very crisply and confidently, \"Elaine, this is Jerry Pines, I\u0027ll give you a call in a day or so.\" Then another hang-up, and then a caller who cleared his throat forcefully, took a long moment trying to think of something to say, and rang off without a word.\\n\\n Then the sixth caller. A fairly long pause, with the tape running and only background noise audible. Then a whisper:\\n\\n \"Hello, Elaine. Did you like the flowers?\"\\n\\n Another pause, as long as the first. Throughout it the background noise, actually quite low in volume, sounded like the roar of a subway train.\\n\\n And then, in the same forceful whisper, he said, \"I was thinking of you earlier. But it\u0027s not your turn yet. You have to wait your turn, you know. I\u0027m saving you for last.\" A pause, but a brief one. \"I mean second-last. He\u0027ll be the last.\"\\n\\n That was all he had to say, but the tape ran another twenty or thirty seconds before he broke the connection. Then the answering machine clicked and whirred and readied itself to handle incoming calls again, and we sat there in a silence that hung in the air like smoke.\\n\\n I was back in my hotel room before dawn, but I didn\u0027t beat the sun by much. It was well past four by the time I got there, and I\u0027d spent the whole night running all over the city, going places I hadn\u0027t been in years. Some of them were long gone, and some of the people I was looking for were gone, too, dead or in jail or in some other world. But there were new places and new people, and I found my way to enough of them to keep busy.\\n\\n I found Danny Boy Bell in Poogan\u0027s. He is a short albino Negro, precise in his gestures and polite in his manners. He has always worn conservatively cut three-piece suits and he has always kept vampire\u0027s hours, never leaving his house between sunrise and sunset. His habits hadn\u0027t changed, and he still drank Russian vodka straight up and ice-cold. The bars that were home to him, Poogan\u0027s Pub and the Top Knot, always kept a bottle on ice for him. The Top Knot\u0027s gone now.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a French restaurant there now,\" he told me. \"High-priced and not very good. I\u0027m here a lot these days. Or I\u0027ll be at Mother Goose on Amsterdam. They got a nice little trio, plays there six nights a week. The drummer uses the brushes and he never takes a solo. And they keep the lights right.\"\\n\\n Right meant dimmed way down. Danny Boy wears dark glasses all the time, and he\u0027d probably wear them at the bottom of a coal mine. \"The world\u0027s too loud and too bright,\" I\u0027d heard him say more than once. \"They should put in a dimmer switch. They should turn the volume down.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t recognize the sketch, but Motley\u0027s name struck a chord with him. I started to fill him in and he remembered the case. \"So he\u0027s coming back at you,\" he said. \"Why don\u0027t you just grab a plane, go someplace warm while he cools off? Guy like that, give him a few weeks and he\u0027ll step on his cock and wind up back in slam. You won\u0027t have to worry about him for another ten years.\"\\n\\n \"I think he\u0027s gotten pretty shrewd.\"\\n\\n \"Went up for one-to-ten and served twelve, how much of a genius can he be?\" He finished his drink and moved his hand a few inches, which was all he had to do to get the waitress\u0027s attention. After she\u0027d filled his glass and assured herself that I was still all right, he said, \"I\u0027ll pass the word and keep my ears open, Matt. All I can do.\"\\n\\n \"I appreciate it.\"\\n\\n \"Hard to know where he might hang out, or who he might rub up against. Still, there\u0027s places you could check.\"\\n\\n He gave me some leads and I went out and chased them around the city. I went to a chicken-and-ribs joint on Lenox Avenue and a bar down the street from it where a lot of the uptown players did their drinking. I caught a cab downtown to a place called Patchwork on Third Avenue in the Twenties, where Early American quilts hung on the exposed brick walls. I told the bartender I was there to see a man named Tommy Vincent. \"He\u0027s not in just now,\" I was told, \"but he usually comes in around this time, if you\u0027d care to wait for him.\"\\n\\n I ordered a Coke and waited at the bar. The back-bar mirror let me keep an eye on the door without turning around. I watched some people come in and some others leave, and by the time I had nothing in my glass but ice cubes, a fat man two stools down from me came over and put an arm around me as if we were old friends. \"I\u0027m Tommy V.,\" he said. \"Something I can do for you?\"\\n\\n I walked on Park Avenue in the Twenties, Third just below Fourteenth Street, Broadway in the high Eighties, Lexington between Forty-seventh and Fiftieth. That\u0027s where the street girls were hard at it, decorously turned out in hot pants and peekaboo halters and orange wigs. I talked to dozens of them, and I let them think I was a cop; they wouldn\u0027t have believed a denial anyway. I showed Motley\u0027s picture around and said he was a man who liked to hurt working girls, and a likely killer. I said he might be a john, or at least play the part of one, but that he fancied himself a pimp and might try to corral an outlaw girl.\\n\\n A sallow blonde on Third, her dark roots giving her a two-tone hairdo, thought she recognized him. \"Saw him a time ago,\" she said. \"Looks but don\u0027t buy. One time he\u0027s got these questions. What will I do, what won\u0027t I do, what do I like, what don\u0027t I like.\" She made a fist, held it at her crotch, moved it in a pumping motion. \"Jerking me around. Got no time for that, you know? Time I see him after that, I just walk on by.\"\\n\\n A girl on Broadway, with an overblown body and a Deep South accent, said she\u0027d seen him around, but not lately. Last she\u0027d seen of him he\u0027d gone off with a girl named Bunny. And where was Bunny? She\u0027d gone off somewhere, disappeared, hadn\u0027t been around in weeks. \"On some other stroll,\" she said. \"Or maybe something happened.\" Like what? She shrugged. \"Anything,\" she said. \"You see somebody,\" she said, \"and then you don\u0027t. And you don\u0027t miss them right away, and then you say, \u0027Hey, what happened to that person?\u0027 And nobody knows.\" Had she seen Bunny again since she\u0027d gone off with Motley? She thought it over and couldn\u0027t say one way or the other. And maybe it hadn\u0027t been Motley that Bunny had gone with. The more she thought about it, the vaguer she seemed to get.\\n\\n Somewhere along the way I managed to get to the midnight meeting at Alanon House, a sort of clubhouse occupying a suite of offices on the third floor of a decaying building on West Forty-sixth Street. They get a young crowd at that meeting, many of them newly and shakily sober, and a majority having a history of heavy drug use along with alcoholism. The crowd that night was a lot like the people outside, the biggest single difference being the direction they were headed. The ones at the meeting were staying clean and sober, or trying to. The ones out there on the street were slipping off the edge of the world. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-ticket-to-the-boneyard-matthew-scudder-8/page-19.html","bookId":2326,"book":{"id":2326,"title":"A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8)","description":"Storyline: A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8) \\n The streets of New York are never safe, but the release of James Leo Motley, a psychopath who went down swearing revenge on Matt Scudder on all who knew him, means death is out there looking for a victim.
