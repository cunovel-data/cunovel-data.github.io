You wring their necks as you come, that\u0027s how you do it with chickens. I didn\u0027t wring her neck. I broke it. Snap, like a twig breaking.\"\n I didn\u0027t say anything.\n \"And then out the window. It was just luck she hit the boy on the way down.\"\n \"Luck.\"\n \"I was trying for Andrea.\"\n \"Who?\"\n \"His girlfriend. Of course I didn\u0027t expect to hit anybody, but I was trying for her.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"I\u0027d rather kill a woman,\" he said.\n I told him he was crazy. I said he was an animal, that he belonged in a cage. He hurt me again, then crossed a leg in front of mine and gave me a shove. I went sprawling on my hands and knees. I scuttled forward, scraping my hands on gravel and broken glass, stumbling over things I couldn\u0027t make out, then spinning around, setting myself, bracing for his approach. He rushed me and I threw a right at him, putting whatever I had into the punch.\n He slipped the blow. The follow-through carried me past him and took me right off my feet. I managed one step, then lost it completely and fell full-length upon the ground.\n I lay there, gasping for breath, waiting for whatever was coming next.\n He let me wait. Then, softly, he said, \"I could kill you right now.\"\n \"Why don\u0027t you.\"\n \"You wish I would, don\u0027t you? Good. In a week you\u0027ll beg me.\"\n I tried to get up onto my hands and knees. He kicked me in the side, just below the rib cage. I scarcely felt it, the pain refused to register, but I stopped trying to get up.\n He knelt at my side and put a hand at the back of my head, cupping the base of the skull. His thumb found the hollow behind the earlobe. He was talking to me but my mind was unable to track his sentences.\n His thumb dug into the spot he\u0027d found. The pain reached a new level, but I had gone somehow beyond pain. It was as though I were standing to one side, observing the sensation as a phenomenon, experiencing more awe than agony.\n Then he turned up the pain a notch. There was already nothing but blackness in front of my eyes, but now the blackness spread behind my eyes as well. There was just one drop of fiery red against a sea of inky black. Then the red shrank to a pinpoint and went out.\n I couldn\u0027t have been out long. I came to abruptly, as if someone had thrown a switch. I used to come to like that after a long night of drinking. There was a period of time when I never fell asleep and never woke up. Instead I would pass out and come to.\n Everything hurt. I lay still at first, taking an inventory of the pain, trying to assess the extent of the damage. It took me a while, too, to make sure that I was alone. He could have been hunkered down alongside me, waiting for me to move.\n When I did get up I did so slowly and tentatively, partly out of prudence, partly of necessity. My body didn\u0027t seem capable of fast movement or sustained activity. When I got up onto my knees, for example, I had to stay there until I summoned up the strength to stand. Then, on my feet at last, I had to wait until the dizziness passed or I would have fallen back down again.\n Eventually I found my way through the obstacle course of litter to the fence and groped along it until I got to where the opening had been cut. I emerged on Attorney Street. I remembered that was where I was, but I\u0027d lost all sense of direction and couldn\u0027t tell which way was uptown. I walked to the corner, which turned out to be Rivington, and then I must have turned east instead of west because I wound up back at Ridge Street. I turned left at Ridge and walked two blocks and finally got to Houston Street, and I didn\u0027t have to stand there too long before a cab came along.\n I held up a hand and he drew up and slowed down. I started toward him, and I guess he got a good look at me then and didn\u0027t like what he saw, because he stepped on the gas and peeled off.\n I would have cursed him if I\u0027d had the strength.\n Instead it was all I could do to remain on my feet. There was a mailbox nearby and I walked over and let it take some of my weight. I looked down at myself and was glad I hadn\u0027t wasted breath cursing the cabbie. I was a mess, with both trouser legs laid open at the knee, my jacket and shirtfront filthy, my hands dark with dried blood and embedded dirt and grit. No cabdriver in his right mind would have wanted me in his hack.\n But one did, and I can\u0027t say he came across as particularly demented. I stayed there at Ridge and Houston for ten or fifteen minutes, not because I really expected anyone to stop for me but because I couldn\u0027t figure out where the nearest subway entrance might be, or trust myself to cope with it once I did. Three more cabs passed me up, and then one stopped. He may have thought I was a police officer. I was trying my best to give that impression, holding up my billfold as if to display a shield.\n When he stopped for me I got the rear door open before he could change his mind. \"I\u0027m sober and I\u0027m not bleeding,\" I assured him. \"I won\u0027t mess up your cab.\"\n \"Fuck the cab,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t own this heap of shit, and so what if I did? Wha\u0027d they do, jump you and roll you? This is no place for you at this hour, man.\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me that a couple of hours ago?\"\n \"Hey, you\u0027re not too bad off if you got your sense of humor. I better get you to a hospital. Bellevue\u0027s closest, but maybe you\u0027d rather go someplace else?\"\n \"The Northwestern Hotel,\" I said. \"That\u0027s on Fifty-seventh and-\"\n \"I know where it\u0027s at, I got a regular pickup five days a week across the street at the Parc Vendome. But are you sure you wouldn\u0027t be better off going to a hospital?\"\n \"No,\" I said. \"I just want to go home.\"\n Jacob was at the desk when I stopped to check for messages. If he noticed anything unusual about my appearance, nothing in his manner showed it. Either he was more diplomatic than I\u0027d ever realized or he\u0027d reached that point in the terpinhydrate bottle where relatively few things got his attention.\n No calls, thank God. I went to my room, closed the door, and put the chain on. I\u0027d done that once before, a few years back, only to discover that a man who wanted to kill me was waiting for me in the bathroom. I\u0027d only managed to lock myself in with him.\n This time, though, all that was waiting for me in the bathroom was the tub, and I couldn\u0027t wait to get into it. But first I braced myself and looked in the mirror.\n It wasn\u0027t as bad as I\u0027d feared. I was carrying some bruises and superficial scrapes and scratches, and some of the grit I\u0027d rolled in, but I hadn\u0027t lost any teeth or broken anything or sustained any bad cuts.\n I looked like hell all the same.\n I got out of my clothes. My suit was beyond salvage; I emptied the pockets and stripped the belt from the slacks and stuffed them and the jacket into the wastebasket. My shirt was ripped and my tie was a mess. I tossed them both.\n I drew a hot tub and soaked in it for a long time, let the water drain out and filled it up again. I sat there and soaked while I picked bits of glass and gravel out of the palms of my hands.\n I don\u0027t know what time it was when I finally got to bed. I never did look at the clock.\n I had swallowed some aspirin before I went to bed, and I took some more as soon as I got up, and another hot bath to draw some of the ache out of muscle and bones. I needed a shave but knew better than to scrape a blade over my face. I found the electric shaver my kids gave me a few Christmases back and did what I could with it.\n There was blood in my urine. It\u0027s always a shock to see that, but I\u0027d taken kidney punches before and knew what they did to you. It was unlikely he\u0027d done me any lasting damage. My kidney ached where he\u0027d poked me, and it would probably pain me for a while, but I figured I\u0027d get over it.\n I went out and had coffee and a roll and read Newsday. Breslin\u0027s column was all about the criminal justice system, and he wasn\u0027t giving it any raves. Another columnist got slightly hysterical on the subject of a death penalty for major narcotics dealers, as if that would make them all weigh the consequences of their actions and turn their talents to investment banking instead.\n If the previous day was up to the year\u0027s average to date, there had been seven homicides within the five boroughs in the course of its twenty-four hours. Newsday had four of them covered. None were in my neighborhood, and none of the victims had names I found familiar. I couldn\u0027t say for sure, but from what I read it didn\u0027t look as though any of my friends had been murdered yesterday.\n I went over to Midtown North but Durkin wasn\u0027t around. I caught the noon meeting at the West Side Y on Sixty-third. The speaker was an actor who\u0027d sobered up on the Coast, and his energy gave a California rah-rah quality to the hour. I walked back to the station house, stopping on the way to get a slice of pizza and a Coke and eat on the street. When I got to Midtown North Durkin was back, holding the phone to his ear and juggling a cigarette and a cup of coffee. He motioned me to a chair and I sat down and waited while he did a lot of listening and not much talking.\n He hung up, leaned forward to scribble something on a pad, then straightened up and looked at me. \"You look like you walked into a fan,\" he said. \"What happened?\"\n \"I got in with bad company,\" I said. \"Joe, I want that bastard picked up. I want to swear out a complaint.\"\n \"Against Motley?\" I nodded. \"He did that to you?\"\n \"Most of what he did is where it doesn\u0027t show. I let myself get suckered into an alley on the Lower East Side late last night.\" I gave him a condensed version, and his dark eyes narrowed as he took it in.\n He said, \"So what do you want to charge him with?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. Assault, I suppose. Assault, coercion, menacing. I suppose assault\u0027s the most effective charge to bring.\"\n \"Any witnesses to the alleged assault?\"\n \"Alleged?\"\n \"You have any witnesses, Matt?\"\n \"Of course not,\" I said. \"We didn\u0027t meet in Macy\u0027s window, we were in an empty lot on Ridge Street.\"\n \"I thought you said it was an alley.\"\n \"What\u0027s the difference? It was a space between two buildings with a fence across it and a gap in the fence. If it was a passage to anything, I suppose you could call it an alley. I didn\u0027t get far enough into it to find out where it went.\"\n \"Uh-huh.\" He picked up a pencil, looked at it. \"I thought you said Attorney Street before.\"\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\n \"Then a minute ago you said Ridge Street.\"\n \"Did I? I met the hooker on Ridge, in a toilet of a place called the Garden Grill. I don\u0027t know why they call it that. There\u0027s no garden, and I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a grill, either.\" I shook my head at the memory. \"Then she took me around the block to Attorney.\"\n \"She? I thought you said a transsexual.\"\n \"I\u0027ve learned to use female pronouns for them.\"\n \"Uh-huh.\"\n \"I suppose she\u0027s a witness,\" I said, \"but it might be a trick to find her, let alone get her to testify.\"\n \"I can see where it might. You get a name?\"\n \"Candy. That would be a street name, of course, and it might have been made up for the occasion. Most of them have a lot of names.\"\n \"Tell me about it.\"\n \"What\u0027s the problem, Joe? He assaulted me and I have a bona fide complaint to file.\"\n \"You\u0027d never make it stick.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-ticket-to-the-boneyard-matthew-scudder-8/page-25.html","bookId":2326,"book":{"id":2326,"title":"A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8)","description":"Storyline: \n A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8) \n The streets of New York are never safe, but the release of James Leo Motley, a psychopath who went down swearing revenge on Matt Scudder on all who knew him, means death is out there looking for a victim.
