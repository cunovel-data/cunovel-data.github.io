{"id":63355,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"\"And he hit you.\" \"No. He walked toward me, and I backed off, and he kept coming until I was backed up against the wall there. He put his hand on me. I was dressed, I had a blouse on. He put his hand right here and he just pressed with two fingers, and there must be a nerve there or some kind of pressure point, because it hurt like fury. There was no mark then. That didn\u0027t show up until this morning.\" \"It\u0027ll probably be worse tomorrow.\" \"Great. It\u0027s sore now, but it\u0027s not terrible. While he was doing it, though, the pain was incredibly intense. I went weak in the knees and I swear I couldn\u0027t see. I thought I was going to black out.\" \"He did that pressing with two fingers.\" \"Yes. Then he let go of me and I was holding on to the wall for support and he fucking grinned at me. \u0027We\u0027ll see a lot of each other,\u0027 he said, \u0027and you\u0027ll do whatever I tell you to do.\u0027 And then he left.\" \"Did you call Connie?\" \"I haven\u0027t been able to reach her.\" \"If this clown calls again-\" \"I\u0027ll tell him to shit in his hat. Don\u0027t worry, Matt, he\u0027s never getting in the door again.\" \"You remember his name?\" \"Motley. James Leo Motley.\" \"He gave you his middle name?\" She nodded. \"And he didn\u0027t ask me to call him Jimmy, either. James Leo Motley. What are you doing?\" \"Writing it down. Maybe I can find out where he lives.\" \"In Central Park, under a flat rock.\" \"And I might as well see if we\u0027ve got a sheet on him. From your description, it wouldn\u0027t surprise me.\" \"James Leo Motley,\" she said. \"If you lose your memo book, just call me. It\u0027s a name I\u0027m not likely to forget.\" I couldn\u0027t find an address for him, but I did pull his yellow sheet. He had a string of six or seven arrests, most of them for assaults upon women. In each case the victim withdrew the complaint and charges were dropped. Once he\u0027d been in a traffic accident, a fender-bender on the Van Wyck Expressway, and he\u0027d given the driver of the other vehicle a serious beating. That case got to court, with Motley charged with first-degree assault, but eyewitness testimony suggested that the other driver may have started the fight, and that he\u0027d been armed with a tire iron while Motley had defended himself with his bare hands. If so, he\u0027d been good enough with those hands to put the other man in the hospital. Six or seven arrests, no convictions. All of the charges involving violence. I didn\u0027t like it, and I was going to call Elaine and let her know what I\u0027d found out, but I didn\u0027t get around to it. A week or so later she called me. I was in the squad room when she called, so she didn\u0027t have to identify herself as Cousin Frances. \"He was just here,\" she said. \"He hurt me.\" \"I\u0027ll be right over.\" She had reached Connie. Connie had been reluctant to talk at first, finally admitting that she\u0027d been seeing James Leo Motley for the past several weeks. He\u0027d gotten her number from someone, she wasn\u0027t sure who, and his first visit had been not unlike the first visit he paid to Elaine. He told her he wasn\u0027t going to pay her, and that she\u0027d be seeing a lot of him. And he hurt her- not badly, but enough to get her attention. Since then he\u0027d been turning up a couple of times a week. He\u0027d started asking her for money, and he\u0027d continued to brutalize her, hurting her both during and after the sex act. He told her repeatedly that he knew what she liked, that she was a cheap whore and she needed to be treated like what she was. \"I\u0027m your man now,\" he told her. \"You belong to me. I own you, body and soul.\" The conversation upset Elaine, understandably enough, and she\u0027d been meaning to tell me about it, just as I\u0027d intended to let her know about Motley\u0027s record. She\u0027d let it go, waiting until she saw me, knowing that she wasn\u0027t in any danger because she wasn\u0027t going to see the son of a bitch again. When he did call, the day after her conversation with Connie, she told him that she was busy. \"Make time for me,\" he said. \"No,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t want to see you again, Mr. Motley.\" \"What makes you think you have any choice?\" \"You asshole,\" she said. \"Look, do us both a favor, will you? Lose my number.\" Two days later he called again. \"I thought I\u0027d give you a chance to change your mind,\" he said. She told him to drop dead and hung up on him. She told all three doormen not to send anyone up without calling first. That was standard policy anyway, but she impressed them with the need for extra security. She turned down a couple of dates with new clients, wary that they might be fronting for Motley. When she left her apartment she had the feeling that she was being followed, or at least observed. It was an uncomfortable feeling, and she didn\u0027t go out unless she had to. Then a few days passed and she didn\u0027t hear further from him, and she started to relax. She meant to call me, and she meant to call Connie again, but she didn\u0027t call either of us. That afternoon she got a call. A man she knew was in town from the Coast, a studio executive she\u0027d see every few months. She got in a cab and spent an easy hour and a half in his suite at the Sherry-Netherland. He told her all sorts of movie-biz gossip, made love to her twice, and gave her a hundred or two hundred dollars, whatever it was. More than enough to cover the cabs. When she got back to her apartment Motley was sitting on the leather couch, not quite smiling at her. She tried to get out the door but she\u0027d locked it and put the chain on the minute she came in, before she saw him, and he had hold of her before she could get the door open. Even if she hadn\u0027t had to screw around with the locks, she figured he would have caught her. \"At the elevator,\" she said, \"or I\u0027d have tripped on the hall carpet, or something. I wasn\u0027t going to get away. He wasn\u0027t going to let me get away.\" He hauled her into the bedroom, ripped her clothes getting them off of her. He hurt her with his hands. The bruise he\u0027d inflicted the first time was faded now, but his fingers went right to the spot and the pain was like a knife. There was another spot he found, on the inside of her thigh, that produced a pain so intense she honestly thought she was going to die from it. He went on hurting her with the simple pressure of his fingers until all her will was gone, all her capacity to resist. Then he flung her facedown on the bed, dropped his pants, and forced himself into her anal passage. \"I don\u0027t do that,\" she said. \"It\u0027s painful, and I think it\u0027s disgusting anyway, and I never liked it. So I don\u0027t do it. I haven\u0027t done it in years. But it actually wasn\u0027t that bad this time because the pain was nothing compared to what he\u0027d been doing to me with his fingertips. And anyway by this time I was sort of detached from it all. I was afraid he was going to kill me, and I was detached from that, too.\" While he sodomized her, he talked to her. He told her she was weak and stupid and filthy. He told her she was only getting what she deserved, and what she secretly wanted. He told her she liked it. He told her he always gave his women what they wanted. Most of them wanted to be hurt, he told her. Some of them wanted to be killed. \"He said he wouldn\u0027t mind killing me. He said he\u0027d killed a girl a while ago who\u0027d looked a lot like me. He killed her first, he said, and then he fucked her. He said a dead girl was as good a fuck as a living one, maybe even better. If you got her while she was still warm, he said. And before she started to stink.\" Afterward he went through her purse and took all her cash, including the money she\u0027d just earned at the Sherry. She was one of his women now, he told her. She\u0027d have to pull her weight. That meant he expected her to have money for him when he came to see her. And it meant she would never again refuse to see him, and she would certainly never again mouth off at him, or call him bad names. Did she understand that? Yes, she said. She understood. Was she sure she understood? Yes, she said. She was sure. He half smiled at her, and ran a hand over that funny cap of hair, then stroked his long chin. \"I want to make sure you understand,\" he said, and he clapped one hand over her mouth and used the other to find the spot on her rib cage. This time she did pass out, and when she came to he was gone. The first thing I did was take her over to the Eighteenth Precinct. The two of us sat down with a cop named Klaiber and she filed a complaint, charging Motley with assault and battery and forcible sodomy. \"There\u0027ll be more charges after he\u0027s picked up,\" I said. \"He took money from her purse, so that\u0027s robbery or extortion or both. And he got into her apartment in her absence.\" \"Any signs of forced entry?\" \"Not that I could spot, but it\u0027s still illegal entry.\" \"You already got forcible sodomy,\" Klaiber said. \"So?\" \"Forcible sodomy and illegal entry, you put them both down and you get a jury confused. They figure it\u0027s two ways of saying the same thing.\" When Elaine excused herself to go to the bathroom he leaned forward and said, \"She a girlfriend or something, Matt?\" \"Let\u0027s say she\u0027s been the source of a lot of useful leads over the past few years.\" \"Fine, we\u0027ll call her a snitch. She\u0027s on the game, right?\" \"So?\" \"So I don\u0027t have to tell you how hard it is to make an assault charge stand up when the complainant is a prostitute. Let alone rape or sodomy. Far as your juror\u0027s concerned, all she did was give away what she usually sold.\" \"I know that.\" \"I figured you did.\" \"I don\u0027t expect a pickup order\u0027s going to accomplish anything, anyway. His last known address is a Times Square hotel, and he hasn\u0027t lived there in a year and a half.\" \"Oh, you\u0027ve been looking for him.\" \"A little bit. He\u0027s probably in another midtown flophouse or living with a woman, and either way he\u0027ll be hard to find. I just want her complaint on file. It can\u0027t hurt further on down the line.\" \"Got it,\" he said. \"Well, no problem, then. And we\u0027ll put out a pickup order just in case he happens to walk into our arms.\" I called Anita and told her I\u0027d be staying in the city around the clock for the next few days. I told her I was on a case I couldn\u0027t break away from. I\u0027d done this before, sometimes legitimately, sometimes because I hadn\u0027t felt like going out to Long Island. As always, she believed me, or pretended to. Then I cleared all of my own cases, dropping some and shunting others off on other people. I didn\u0027t want anything else on my plate. I wanted to get James Leo Motley, and I wanted to get him right. I told Elaine we\u0027d have to trap Motley and she\u0027d have to be the bait. She wasn\u0027t crazy about the idea, didn\u0027t really ever want to be in the same room with him again, but she had a nice tough core to her and she was willing to do what had to be done. I moved in with Elaine and we waited. She canceled all her bookings and told everyone who called that she had the flu and wouldn\u0027t be available for a week. \"This is costing me a fortune,\" she complained. \"Some of these guys may never call back.\" \"You\u0027re just playing hard to get. They\u0027ll want you all the more.\" \"Yeah, look how well that worked with Motley.\" We never left the apartment. She cooked once, but the rest of the time we ordered in. We pretty much lived on pizza and Chinese food. The liquor store delivered bourbon, and she got the guy at the corner deli to send over a case of Tab.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-ticket-to-the-boneyard-matthew-scudder-8/page-5.html","bookId":2326,"book":{"id":2326,"title":"A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8)","description":"Storyline: A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8) The streets of New York are never safe, but the release of James Leo Motley, a psychopath who went down swearing revenge on Matt Scudder on all who knew him, means death is out there looking for a victim.
