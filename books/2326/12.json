{"id":63362,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\"We were talking about a subway series this year,\" I said. \"The Mets and the Yankees, but the Mets lost out in the playoffs and the Yankees were out of it completely.\"\\n\\n \"I wish I had the time to follow baseball,\" he said. \"But I just don\u0027t. Football, I have about half my Sundays off, and I\u0027m almost always free to watch the Monday night games.\"\\n\\n Then, over coffee, we got back on track. \"Why I asked about a photo,\" he said, \"is at this point you haven\u0027t given me enough to justify reopening the case. We\u0027ll have to see what we get from the lab work they\u0027ll be doing at Booth in Cleveland. If they can say for sure that semen\u0027s from somebody else, maybe that\u0027ll tilt the balance. Meanwhile, what we got is a piece of mail mailed and delivered in New York City, and that doesn\u0027t mean a lot to my chief here in Massillon.\"\\n\\n \"I can understand that.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s assume you\u0027ve got the right reading on this and your man did it. The murders took place a week ago last night. I\u0027d say he\u0027d have had to\u0027ve been in town a few days beforehand, and possibly as much as a week. I suppose it\u0027s theoretically possible that he committed the murders the day he arrived, but I\u0027d say it was more likely he took some time to look the situation over.\"\\n\\n \"I would certainly think so. He\u0027s a planner, and he had twelve years to let it all ripen. He\u0027d figure to take his time.\"\\n\\n \"And he left town with a clipping from Thursday night\u0027s paper, so he was still here when the paper hit the street that afternoon. There\u0027s a downtown newsstand that gets it around four, but most places don\u0027t have it for sale until five or six. So he was here that long, and maybe overnight. When was the postmark?\"\\n\\n \"Saturday.\"\\n\\n \"So he clipped a newspaper Thursday night in Massillon and mailed it Saturday in New York. And it was delivered Monday?\"\\n\\n \"Tuesday.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s not so bad. Sometimes they take a week, don\u0027t they? You know what the post office and the Florsheim Shoe Company got in common?\" I didn\u0027t. \"Half a million loafers they\u0027d love to unload but nobody wants \u0027em. Why I asked about the postmark, if he mailed it Friday we could be pretty sure he flew from here to New York. Not a hundred percent, because you can drive it in ten hours if you push it. You happen to know if he has a car?\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"I don\u0027t even know where he lives, or what he\u0027s been doing since they cut him loose.\"\\n\\n \"I was thinking we could check with the airlines, look for his name on the passenger manifests. You think he\u0027d use his right name?\"\\n\\n \"No. I think he\u0027d pay cash and use an alias.\"\\n\\n \"Or pay with a stolen credit card, and that wouldn\u0027t have his right name on it, either. He probably put up at a hotel or motel here, and again I don\u0027t suppose we\u0027ll find James Leo Motley signed on any registration cards, but if we had a photo to circulate somebody might recognize his picture.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see what I can do.\"\\n\\n \"If he flew, he\u0027d have needed a car to get around. He could have come by bus from Cleveland but he\u0027d still need a car in Massillon. You have to show a license and a credit card to rent one.\"\\n\\n \"He could have stolen one.\u0027\u0027\\n\\n \"Could have. Lot of things to check, and I don\u0027t know what any of \u0027em might prove. I don\u0027t know how much effort I can get the department to put into checking, either. If the right word comes back from Booth Memorial, then we might do something. Otherwise I have to say our effort will most likely be minimal.\"\\n\\n \"I can understand that.\"\\n\\n \"When you\u0027ve only got so many man-hours available to you,\" he said, \"and when you\u0027re looking at a case you were able to close half an hour after it opened, well, you can see how you wouldn\u0027t be in a hurry to open it up again.\"\\n\\n Afterward he gave me precise directions to the Hall of Fame in Canton. I listened, but without paying much attention. I was willing to believe it was fascinating, but I wasn\u0027t in the mood to stare through plate glass at Bronko Nagurski\u0027s old jersey and Sid Luckman\u0027s leather helmet. Besides, I had to turn in the Tempo in Cleveland or Hertz would charge me for a second day.\\n\\n I gave it back to them with time to spare. My flight turned out to be overbooked, and before boarding they asked for volunteers to relinquish their seats and take a later flight, with the reward of a free trip anywhere in the continental United States. I couldn\u0027t think of anyplace I wanted to go. Evidently enough other people could, because they got their volunteers in short order.\\n\\n I fastened my seat belt, opened my book, read a paragraph of Marcus Aurelius, and promptly fell asleep with the book in my lap. I didn\u0027t stir until we were making our descent into La Guardia.\\n\\n My seat companion, wearing granny glasses and a Western Reserve sweatshirt, pointed to my book and asked me if it was something like TM. Sort of, I said.\\n\\n \"I guess it really works,\" she said enviously. \"You were truly spaced.\"\\n\\n I took a bus and a subway into Manhattan; the rush hour was in full swing, and that figured to be faster than a cab, and twenty dollars cheaper. I went straight to my hotel and checked my mail and messages, none of them important. I went upstairs and took a shower and called Elaine and brought her up to date. We didn\u0027t talk long, and then I went downstairs and had a bite and went over to St. Paul \u0027s for a meeting.\\n\\n The speaker was a regular member of the group, sober a good number of years, and instead of telling an elaborate drinking story he talked this time about what he\u0027d been going through lately. He\u0027d had conflicts at work, and one of his kids was in bad trouble with drugs and alcohol. He wound up talking a lot about acceptance, and that became the meeting\u0027s unofficial topic. I thought about Marcus Aurelius\u0027s wise words on the subject, about everything happening the way it was supposed to happen, and during the discussion period I considered talking about that, and relating it to what had happened in a picture-book suburb of Massillon, Ohio. But the meeting ended before I got around to raising my hand.\\n\\n In the morning I called Reliable and told them I wouldn\u0027t be able to come in that day. I\u0027d told them the same thing the day before, and the person I spoke to asked me to hold, and then the fellow I reported to came on the line.\\n\\n \"I had some work for you yesterday and today,\" he said. \"Can I expect you tomorrow?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure. Probably not.\"\\n\\n \"Probably not. What\u0027s the story, you working a case of your own?\"\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s something personal.\"\\n\\n \"Something personal. How about Monday?\" I hesitated, and before I could reply he said, \"You know, there\u0027s a lot of guys out there can do this kind of work and are glad to get it.\"\\n\\n \"I know that.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not a regular job, you\u0027re not on the payroll, but all the same I need people I can count on to come in when I got work for them.\"\\n\\n \"I appreciate that,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027re going to be able to count on me for the next little while.\"\\n\\n \"The next little while. How long is that?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. It depends how things work out.\"\\n\\n There was a long pause, then a sudden bark of laughter. He said, \"You\u0027re drinking again, aren\u0027t you? Jesus, why didn\u0027t you just say so in the first place? Give me a call when you\u0027ve got it out of your system and I\u0027ll see if I\u0027ve got anything for you.\"\\n\\n Rage boiled up within me, immediate and volcanic. I choked on it until I heard him break the connection, then slammed the receiver down. I stalked away from the phone, my blood singing with the implacable fury of the falsely accused. I thought of a dozen things to tell him. First, though, I\u0027d go over there and throw all his tables and chairs out the window. Then I\u0027d tell him how he could change my per diem into nickels, and just where he could put it. And then-\\n\\n What I did was call Jim Faber at work. He heard me out, and then he laughed at me. \"You know,\" he said reasonably, \"if you weren\u0027t an alcoholic in the first place, you wouldn\u0027t give a shit.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s got no right to think I\u0027m drunk.\"\\n\\n \"How is it your business what he thinks?\"\\n\\n \"Are you saying I haven\u0027t got a right to be angry?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m saying you can\u0027t afford it. How close are you to picking up a drink?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to pick up a drink.\"\\n\\n \"No, but you\u0027re closer than you were before you talked with the son of a bitch. That\u0027s what you really felt like doing, isn\u0027t it? Before you called me instead.\"\\n\\n I thought about it. \"Maybe,\" I said.\\n\\n \"But you picked up the phone, and now you\u0027re starting to cool off.\"\\n\\n We talked for a few minutes, and by the time I hung up my anger had lost its edge. Who was I really angry at? The guy at Reliable, who\u0027d as much as said he was willing to hire me again after my bender had run its course? Not likely.\\n\\n Motley, I decided. Motley, for starting all this in the first place.\\n\\n Or myself, maybe. For being powerless to do anything about it.\\n\\n The hell with it. I picked up the phone and made some calls, and then I went over to Midtown North to talk to Joe Durkin.\\n\\n I never met Joe Durkin while I was on the job, although our years of service overlapped. I\u0027d known him now for three or four years, and he\u0027d become as good a friend as I had in the NYPD. We\u0027d done each other a little good over the years. Once or twice he\u0027d steered a client in my direction, and a few times I\u0027d turned up something useful and passed it on to him.\\n\\n When I first met him he was counting the months toward his twenty years, figuring to put in his papers the day he hit that magic number. He couldn\u0027t wait, he always said, to get off the job and out of the goddamned city. He was still saying the same thing, but the number had changed to twenty-five, now that he\u0027d passed the twenty-year mark.\\n\\n The years have packed meat around his middle and thinned the dark hair that he combs flat across his head, and his face shows the florid cheeks and broken blood vessels of the heavy hitter. He had quit cigarettes for a while, but now he was smoking again. His ashtray overflowed onto the desktop, and he had a fresh cigarette burning. He put it out before I was halfway through with my story, and he had another one going before I was finished.\\n\\n When I was done he tilted his chair back and blew a trio of smoke rings. There wasn\u0027t a lot of air moving in the detective squad room that morning. The rings drifted to the ceiling without losing their shape.\\n\\n \"Hell of a story,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"This guy in Ohio sounds like a pretty decent fellow. What\u0027s his name, Havlicek? Wasn\u0027t there a guy with the same name played for the Celtics?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"Also named Tom, if I\u0027m not mistaken.\"\\n\\n \"No, I think it was John.\"\\n\\n \"You sure? Maybe you\u0027re right. Your guy any relation?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t ask him.\"\\n\\n \"No? Well, you had other things on your mind. What is it you want to do, Matt?\"\\n\\n \"I want to put that son of a bitch where he belongs.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, he did what he could to stay there. A guy like that\u0027s a good bet to die inside the walls. You think they can make any kind of a case against him in Massillon?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. You know, he got a big break when they read it as murder-suicide and closed it out on the spot.\"\\n\\n \"It sounds as though we\u0027d have done the same thing.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe, or maybe not. We\u0027d have had his call on file, for one thing. Taped, with a chance of voiceprint ID. We\u0027d have run more elaborate forensic workups on all five victims as a matter of course.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-ticket-to-the-boneyard-matthew-scudder-8/page-12.html","bookId":2326,"book":{"id":2326,"title":"A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8)","description":"Storyline: A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8) \\n The streets of New York are never safe, but the release of James Leo Motley, a psychopath who went down swearing revenge on Matt Scudder on all who knew him, means death is out there looking for a victim.
