{"id":63385,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"\"I ought to get to sleep,\" I said. \"You\u0027re not even tired.\" He was right. I wasn\u0027t. I don\u0027t know how he knew it, because I must have looked tired, but the whole evening had somehow energized me. He drove downtown and west and parked at a fire hydrant in front of an old-fashioned diner across from the river a few blocks south of the entrance to the Holland Tunnel. A white-haired waitress brought us menus. He ordered steak and eggs, the steak rare, the eggs over easy. They had Philadelphia-style scrapple on the menu, and I ordered that with scrambled eggs. And coffee, I said. \"Did you want the special coffee?\" I asked what it was. She looked uncomfortable, and Ballou told her I\u0027d have plain black coffee, but that he\u0027d like the special coffee. At that point I caught on, and I wasn\u0027t surprised when the special coffee turned out to be straight scotch served in a coffee mug. He said, \"You can give the police his address.\" \"I could. I don\u0027t know what they\u0027d do with it. I tried to press charges against him and Durkin wouldn\u0027t even listen to me.\" \"There\u0027s more,\" he said. \"You have to do this alone.\" \"Do I?\" \"I think you do. It\u0027s between the two of you, and that\u0027s how it has to be settled.\" \"That\u0027s how it feels to me, too,\" I admitted. \"But it doesn\u0027t make sense. It\u0027s not as though he\u0027s a worthy foe and I have to meet him as an equal. He\u0027s a murderous psychopathic son of a bitch and I\u0027d love it if he got hit by a bus crossing the street.\" \"I\u0027d buy the driver a drink.\" \"I\u0027d buy him a new bus. But I can\u0027t wait for a bus to get him, and there\u0027s as much chance of that as the cops bagging him. I got a call earlier from the police lieutenant in Ohio. He did some work on his own, found a motel clerk who ID\u0027d Motley. But nothing like that is going to make a difference in this case. I have to face him myself and I wish I knew why.\" \"Your business with him is personal.\" \"Is it? I\u0027m not even in a rage. I was before, God knows, but I used it all up on that big stupid kid in the park. It ran away from me, Mick. I could have killed him.\" \"Small loss.\" \"A big loss to me if I went away for it. Anyway, my rage went away somewhere after that. I must be carrying a lot of anger, but I swear to God I can\u0027t feel it. I must hate the bastard, but I don\u0027t feel that, either. I just feel-\" \"What?\" \"Driven.\" \"Ah.\" \"He\u0027s my problem and I have to solve him. Maybe it\u0027s because I set him up twelve years ago. I didn\u0027t play according to the rules, and everything that\u0027s happened since has to be charged to my account. Or maybe it\u0027s simpler than that. It\u0027s personal to him, and maybe there\u0027s no way to avoid buying into his perception of it. Either way, I have to do something about him. He\u0027s the boulder in front of my door. If I don\u0027t shove him out of the way I\u0027ll never leave the house again.\" I drank the rest of my coffee. The grounds were like sludge on the bottom of the cup. \"Except he\u0027s an invisible boulder,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve got a sketch of him based on a pair of twelve-year-old memories. I never get to see him. I keep looking over my shoulder and he\u0027s never quite there.\" \"He was there the other night. In the empty lot.\" \"Was he? I think back on it and it might as well have happened in a dream. I never quite got to see him. He was behind me almost all the time. The one time I took a swing at him I couldn\u0027t really see what I was doing. It was dark as a coal mine in there, all I saw was a shape. Then I was facedown in the dirt, and then I was unconscious, and then I was all by myself. I suppose I should be grateful for the aches and bruises. They were proof the whole thing really happened. Every time I pissed blood I knew I hadn\u0027t made it all up.\" He nodded, and ran his right forefinger over a scar on the back of his left hand. \"Sometimes pain\u0027s a great comfort,\" he said. \"I went to take him down and bring him in,\" I said. \"In a funny way I have a better shot than the cops do. I\u0027m a private citizen, so none of the Supreme Court rulings get in my way. I don\u0027t need probable cause to search his dwelling, and I can enter the premises illegally without disqualifying any evidence I turn up. I don\u0027t have to read him his rights. If I get a confession out of him, they can\u0027t disallow it on the grounds that he didn\u0027t get to consult an attorney. I can record anything he says without getting a court order first, and I don\u0027t even have to tell him I\u0027m doing it.\" The waitress brought me more coffee. I said, \"I want him in cuffs and leg irons, Mick. I want to see him sent away and know he won\u0027t be coming out again. And I think you\u0027re right. I think I have to bring him in myself.\" \"You may not be able to. You may have to use the gun.\" \"I\u0027ll use it if I have to.\" \"I\u0027d use it first chance. I\u0027d shoot him in the back.\" Maybe I would, too. I couldn\u0027t really say what I\u0027d do, or when I might get to do it. Chasing after him was like pursuing mist once the sun came up. So far all I had was an address and an apartment number, and I didn\u0027t even know if he really lived there. When I was a working cop there had been restaurants where I didn\u0027t get a check. The owners liked having us around, and I guess they thought our presence was worth the occasional free meal. Evidently some establishments feel similarly about career criminals, because there was no check for us at the diner. We each left five dollars for the waitress, and Mick stopped at the counter to pick up a couple of containers of coffee. The Cadillac had a ticket on the windshield. He folded it and tucked it in a pocket without comment. The sky was growing light, the morning still and fresh around us. He drove up along the river and over the George Washington Bridge to the Jersey side, then headed north on the Palisades Parkway, pulling off at an overlook high above the Hudson. He parked with the big car\u0027s nose against the guardrail and we sat and watched the dawn come up over the city. I don\u0027t think either of us had said more than a dozen words since we left the diner, and we didn\u0027t speak now. After a while he got our coffees out of the paper sack and handed one to me. He reached across me to open the glove compartment and removed a half-pint silver flask. He uncapped it and added an ounce or two of whiskey to his coffee. I must have reacted visibly because he turned and raised his brows at me. \"I used to drink coffee that way,\" I said. \"With twelve-year-old Irish?\" \"With any kind of whiskey. Bourbon, mostly.\" He capped the flask, took a long pull of the sweetened coffee. \"Sometimes,\" he said, \"I wish to God you\u0027d take a drink.\" \"So you\u0027ve said.\" \"But do you know something? If you reached for the flask right now I\u0027d break your arm.\" \"You just don\u0027t want me drinking up your whiskey.\" \"I don\u0027t want you drinking any man\u0027s whiskey. And I couldn\u0027t tell you why. Have you been up here before?\" \"Not in years. And never at this hour.\" \"It\u0027s the best time. In a little while we\u0027ll go to mass.\" \"Oh?\" \"The eight o\u0027clock at St. Bernard\u0027s. The butchers\u0027 mass. You went with me once before. What\u0027s so funny?\" \"I spend half my life in church basements, and you\u0027re the only person I know who goes to church.\" \"Your sober friends don\u0027t go?\" \"I suppose some of them must, but if so I haven\u0027t heard them talk about it. What do you want to drag me to mass for, Mick? I\u0027m not even a Catholic.\" \"Weren\u0027t you raised one?\" I shook my head. \"I was brought up sort of half-assed Protestant. Nobody in the family went regularly.\" \"Ah. Well, what difference does it make? You don\u0027t have to be a fucking Catholic to go to the fucking mass, do you?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"I don\u0027t go for God. I don\u0027t go for the fucking church. I go because my father went every morning of his life.\" He took a short pull straight from the flask. \"God, that\u0027s good. It\u0027s too good to put in coffee. I don\u0027t know why the old man went and I don\u0027t know why I go. Sometimes it\u0027s where I want to be after a long night, and it\u0027s a good night we\u0027ve just had. Come to mass with me.\" \"All right.\" He drove back into town and left the car on West Fourteenth in front of Twomey\u0027s funeral parlor. The eight o\u0027clock mass was held in a small chapel off the main sanctuary at St. Bernard\u0027s. There were less than two dozen people in attendance, perhaps half of them dressed like Mick in white butcher\u0027s aprons. When the mass ended they would go to work in the meat markets just south and west of the old church. I took my cues from the others, standing or sitting or kneeling when they did. When they handed out the communion wafers I stayed where I was. So did Mick, along with three or four of the others. Back at the car he said, \"Where now? Your hotel?\" I nodded. \"I ought to get some sleep.\" \"Wouldn\u0027t you sleep better in a place unknown to him? I\u0027ve an apartment you could use.\" \"Maybe later,\" I said. \"I\u0027m safe enough for now. He\u0027s saving me for last.\" In front of the Northwestern he shifted the car into park but left the engine running. He said, \"You\u0027ve got the gun.\" \"In my pocket.\" \"If you need more shells-\" \"If I need more shells I\u0027m in deep trouble.\" \"Well, if there\u0027s anything you need.\" \"Thanks, Mick.\" \"Sometimes I wish you drank,\" he said, \"and then I\u0027m glad you don\u0027t.\" He looked at me. \"Why is that?\" \"I don\u0027t know, but I think I understand. Sometimes I wish you didn\u0027t drink, and sometimes I\u0027m glad you do.\" \"I never have nights like this with anybody else.\" \"Neither do I.\" \"The mass was all right, wasn\u0027t it?\" \"It was fine.\" He fixed his eyes on me. \"Do you ever pray?\" he demanded. \"Sometimes I talk to myself. Inside my head, I mean.\" \"I know what you mean.\" \"Maybe that\u0027s praying. I don\u0027t know. Maybe I do it in the hope that something is listening.\" \"Ah.\" \"I heard a new prayer the other day. A fellow said it was the most useful one he knew. \u0027Thank you for everything just as it is.\u0027 \" His eyes narrowed and he mouthed the words silently. Then his lips curled into a slow smile. \"Oh, that\u0027s grand,\" he said. \"Wherever did you hear that one?\" \"At a meeting.\" \"That\u0027s the sort of thing you hear at those meetings, is it?\" He chuckled, and for a moment I thought he was going to say something else. Then he straightened up in his seat. \"Well, I won\u0027t keep you,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll want to get some sleep.\" In my room I shucked off my topcoat and hung it up, then drew the gun out of my jacket pocket. I swung the cylinder out, dumped the shells into the palm of my hand. They were hollow points, designed to expand upon impact. That made them do more damage than standard rounds, but it also lessened the likelihood of a dangerous ricochet, because the slug would shatter into fragments upon impact with a solid surface instead of ricocheting intact. If I\u0027d had hollow points in my gun some years ago I might not have caused the death of that child in Washington Heights, and who could say what a difference that might have made in all our lives? There was a time when I could drink away hours on end running that one through my mind.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-ticket-to-the-boneyard-matthew-scudder-8/page-35.html","bookId":2326,"book":{"id":2326,"title":"A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8)","description":"Storyline: A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8) The streets of New York are never safe, but the release of James Leo Motley, a psychopath who went down swearing revenge on Matt Scudder on all who knew him, means death is out there looking for a victim.
