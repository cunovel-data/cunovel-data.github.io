Oh, because we know he had blood on him to wash off, and you never get all of it. So if there\u0027s none of their blood on his hands or his clothing, and if we do find traces of their blood in the bathroom sink, then somebody else killed them.\" He frowned and thought about it. \"If there had been a single false note at the crime scene,\" he said. \"If we had had the slightest reason to suspect this was anything other than what it looked to be, why, we might have taken a longer look at the physical evidence. But for God\u0027s sake, man, he called us up and told us what he\u0027d done. We sent a car out and found him dead. When you\u0027ve got a confession and the killer dead by his own hand, it tends to put a damper on further inquiry.\" \"I understand that,\" I said. \"And I haven\u0027t seen anything here today to change my mind. You saw the padlock on the front door. We put that on after, on account of we had to force the door when we got here. He had it locked with the chain on, the way you\u0027ll do when you\u0027re settled in for the night.\" \"The killer could have gone out another door.\" \"The back door was locked the same way, bolted from inside.\" \"He could have used a window and closed it after him. It wouldn\u0027t have been that hard to do. Sturdevant would already have been dead when the killer made the phone call. Do you automatically record calls to headquarters?\" \"No. We log \u0027em, but we don\u0027t tape \u0027em. Is that how they do it in New York?\" \"There\u0027s a tape made of calls to 911.\" \"Then it\u0027s a shame he didn\u0027t do this in New York,\" he said, \"so there\u0027d be a record, same as your medical examiner could tell us what everybody had for breakfast. But I\u0027m afraid we\u0027re a little backward here.\" \"I didn\u0027t say that.\" He thought a moment. \"No,\" he said. \"I guess you didn\u0027t.\" \"They don\u0027t record calls into the individual precincts in New York, or at least they didn\u0027t when I was on the job. And they only started taping the 911 calls when it turned out that the operators were incompetent and kept screwing up. I\u0027m not trying to play City Mouse, Country Mouse with you, Lieutenant. I don\u0027t think we\u0027d have looked any harder at this case than you people did. As a matter of fact, the biggest difference between the way you\u0027ve handled it and the way they\u0027d have done it in New York is that you\u0027ve been very decent and cooperative with me. If a cop or ex-cop from out of town came to New York with the same story, he\u0027d get a lot of doors shut in his face.\" He didn\u0027t say anything just then. Back in the living room he said, \"I can see where it might not be a bad idea to tape incoming calls. Shouldn\u0027t be all that costly to set up, either. What would it do for us in this instance? You\u0027re thinking voiceprint, but for that you\u0027d need a recording of Sturdevant\u0027s voice for comparison purposes.\" \"Did he have an answering machine? He might have taped a message.\" \"I don\u0027t think so. Those machines aren\u0027t all that popular around here. Of course there might be some record of his voice somewhere. Home video, that sort of thing. I don\u0027t know if something like that would work for voiceprint comparison, though I don\u0027t see why not.\" \"If you had the call taped,\" I said, \"you could find out one thing easily enough. You could find out if it was Motley.\" \"Well, you could at that,\" he said. \"I never even thought of that, but when you\u0027ve got an actual suspect it makes a difference, doesn\u0027t it? If you had a call taped and the voiceprint matched your Mr. Motley, you\u0027d pretty much have him hanged, wouldn\u0027t you?\" \"Not until we get a new governor.\" \"Oh, that\u0027s right. Your man keeps vetoing the death-penalty bills, doesn\u0027t he? But in a manner of speaking, you\u0027d have your killer cold.\" He shook his head. \"Speaking of voiceprints, you can probably guess we didn\u0027t do any dusting for fingerprints.\" \"Why should you? It looked open-and-shut.\" \"We do a lot of things routinely when there\u0027s not much point to them. Shame we didn\u0027t do that.\" \"I\u0027ve a feeling Motley didn\u0027t leave any fingerprints.\" \"Still, it would be nice to know. I could get a crew in here now, but there\u0027ve been so many people through here by this time I don\u0027t think we\u0027d have much luck. Besides, it\u0027d mean reopening the case, and I have to say you haven\u0027t given me cause to do that.\" He hooked his thumbs in his belt and looked at me. \"You honestly think he did it?\" \"Yes.\" \"Can you point to any kind of corroborating evidence? A clipping in the mail and a New York postmark, that may be enough to get you thinking, but it doesn\u0027t do a lot to change how the case looks from here.\" I thought about that one while we left the house. Havlicek drew the door shut and snapped the padlock. It was cooler now, and the birch trees cast long shadows across the lawn. I asked when the killings had taken place. Wednesday night, he said. \"So it\u0027s been a week.\" \"Will be in a matter of hours. The call came in around midnight. I could give you the time to the minute, if it matters, because as I said we keep a log.\" \"I just wondered about the date,\" I said. \"There was no indication on the clipping. I suppose the story would have run in Thursday night\u0027s paper.\" \"That\u0027s right, and there were follow-up stories the next day or two, but they won\u0027t tell you anything. Nothing else came to light, so there wasn\u0027t much for them to write about. Just that people were surprised, no indication he was under that kind of stress. The usual things you get from friends and neighbors.\" \"What kind of a workup did your medical examiner do?\" \"The chief of pathology over at the hospital does our medical exams. I don\u0027t think he did much beyond looking at the bodies and confirming that the wounds were consistent with the way we read the case. Why?\" \"You still have the bodies on hand?\" \"I don\u0027t believe they\u0027ve been released yet. I don\u0027t know that we\u0027re clear on who we\u0027re supposed to release them to, far as that goes. You got something specific in mind?\" \"I was wondering if he\u0027d happened to check for semen.\" \"Jesus God. You think he raped her?\" \"It\u0027s possible.\" \"No signs of a struggle.\" \"Well, he\u0027s very strong, and she might not have tried to fight him off. You were asking about corroborative evidence. If there were semen traces, and if the lab work established the semen didn\u0027t come from Sturdevant-\" \"That\u0027d be corroboration, wouldn\u0027t it? You might even wind up matching the semen to your suspect. I\u0027ll tell you, I\u0027m not even going to apologize for not ordering a check for pecker tracks. That\u0027s about the last thing that would have occurred to me.\" \"If you\u0027ve still got the bodies-\" \"We can get him to run tests now. I was already thinking that. I don\u0027t guess she happened to douche in the past few days, do you?\" \"I wouldn\u0027t think so.\" \"Well, let\u0027s find out,\" he said. \"Let\u0027s see if we can catch the doc before he goes home for dinner. God, his line of work\u0027s got to be hell on a man\u0027s appetite. Police work\u0027s bad enough. Though I seem to manage, don\u0027t I?\" He clapped a hand to his gut and flashed a rueful grin. \"Let\u0027s go,\" he said. \"Maybe we\u0027ll get lucky.\" The pathologist had left for the day. \"He\u0027ll be in eight o\u0027clock tomorrow morning,\" Havlicek said. \"You did say you were staying over, didn\u0027t you, Matt?\" We were Matt and Tom now. I said I was booked on a late-afternoon flight the following day. \"The Great Western\u0027s the best place to stay,\" he said. \"It\u0027s east of town on Lincoln Way. If you like Italian food you can\u0027t go wrong at Padula\u0027s, that\u0027s right at First Street, or there\u0027s a restaurant at the motel that\u0027s not bad. Or here\u0027s a better idea, let me call my wife and see if she can\u0027t set an extra place at the table.\" \"That\u0027s decent of you,\" I said, \"but I think I\u0027m going to beg off. I had about two hours\u0027 sleep last night and I\u0027m afraid I might fall asleep at the table. Suppose you let me take you to lunch tomorrow?\" \"We\u0027ll have to argue about who takes who, but it\u0027s a date. You want to meet me first thing in the morning and we\u0027ll go see the doc? Is eight o\u0027clock too early for you?\" \"Eight o\u0027clock is fine,\" I said. I got my car from the lot where I\u0027d left it and found my way to the motel he\u0027d recommended. I got a room on the second floor and took a shower, then watched the news on CNN. They had cable reception and pulled in thirty channels. After the newscast I worked the dial and found a prizefight on some cable channel I\u0027d never heard of. A pair of Hispanic welterweights were spending most of their time in clinches. I watched until I realized that I wasn\u0027t paying any attention to what I was seeing. I went to the restaurant and had a veal chop and a baked potato and coffee and went back to the room. I called Elaine. Her machine answered, and when I identified myself she picked up and turned the machine off. She was doing fine, she said, sitting behind her barricades and waiting. So far there\u0027d been no untoward phone calls and nothing unlikely in the day\u0027s mail. I told her what I\u0027d done, and that I\u0027d be seeing the pathologist in the morning, that I\u0027d ask him to look for semen traces. \"Make sure he checks in back,\" she said. We talked a little more. She sounded all right. I told her I\u0027d call when I got back to the city, and then I rang off and worked my way around the TV dial without finding anything that grabbed me. I got my book from my briefcase. It was The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. Jim Faber, my AA sponsor, had recommended it to me, quoting a couple of lines that had sounded interesting, and one day I\u0027d stopped at the Strand and picked up a used copy of the Modern Library edition for a couple of dollars. I\u0027d been finding it slow going. I liked some of the things he said, but a lot of the time I would have trouble tracking his argument, and when I did hit a sentence that resonated for me I would have to put the book aside and think about it for a half hour or so. This time I read a page or two, and then I hit this passage: Whatever happens at all happens as it should; thou wilt find this true, if thou shouldst watch narrowly. I closed the book and put it on the table next to me. I tried to imagine the events at the Sturdevant home a week ago. I wasn\u0027t sure what order he did them in, but for the sake of argument I decided he\u0027d taken Sturdevant out first because he\u0027d have presented the greatest danger. Still, the report of the shotgun would have awakened everybody else. So maybe he\u0027d have gone to the kids\u0027 rooms first, working his way down the hallway, moving from one room to the next, stabbing the two boys and the girl in turn. Then Connie? No, he\u0027d have saved her for last. He\u0027d wash up in the bathroom off the master bedroom. Let\u0027s say he immobilized her, got her husband into the living room at gun- or knife-point, killed him with the shotgun, then went back and did Connie. And raped her while he was at it? Well, I\u0027d found out tomorrow, if you could still detect the presence of semen a week after the fact. Then a phone call, and then a quick trip through the house to get rid of fingerprints. And, finally, a quick and silent exit through a window, and he was on his way. Five people dead, three of them small children. A whole family gone because twelve years ago a woman had sworn out a statement against a man who\u0027d forced himself on her.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-ticket-to-the-boneyard-matthew-scudder-8/page-10.html","bookId":2326,"book":{"id":2326,"title":"A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8)","description":"Storyline: A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8) The streets of New York are never safe, but the release of James Leo Motley, a psychopath who went down swearing revenge on Matt Scudder on all who knew him, means death is out there looking for a victim.
