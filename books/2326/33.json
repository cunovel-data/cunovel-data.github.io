{"id":63383,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"\"You hang on to it,\" I suggested. \"I can always ask for it back if it\u0027s old news.\"\n \"True, but-\"\n \"And if it\u0027s straight,\" I said, \"I might not be around to pay you. So you\u0027d better take the money now.\"\n \"I won\u0027t dignify that with an answer,\" he said.\n \"But you\u0027ll keep the money.\"\n \"I doubt I\u0027ll keep it long. Crystal\u0027s an expensive toy. Do you want to stay for another set, Matthew? If not, would you stop at the bar and tell the little darling it\u0027s safe to return? And put your money away, I\u0027ll pay for your coffee. My God, you\u0027re as bad as Brian.\"\n \"I only drank half of that last cup,\" I told him. \"It\u0027s not bad for instant, though. You\u0027re welcome to the rest of it.\"\n \"That\u0027s decent of you,\" he said. \"That\u0027s real decent.\"\n The cabbie had it all figured out. The only way to handle the crack problem was to cut off the supply. You couldn\u0027t lessen the demand because everybody who tried the stuff got addicted to it, and you couldn\u0027t seal the borders, and you couldn\u0027t control production in Latin America because the dealers were more powerful than the governments.\n \"So you gotta be the government,\" he said. \"What we do, we annex the fuckers. Take \u0027em over. Make \u0027em territories at first, until they shape up and they\u0027re ready for statehood. Right away you dry up your drugs at the source. And you got no more wetbacks, because how can people sneak into a country when they\u0027re already there? Any place where you got your insurgents, your rebels up in the hills, you declare \u0027em citizens and draft their asses into the U.S. Army. Next thing you know they got three hots and a cot, they got clean uniforms and GI haircuts and they\u0027re shopping at the PX. You do this right, you solve all your problems at once.\"\n He let me out at the ideal place for solving all my problems at once. Tenth and Fiftieth. Grogan\u0027s Open House, Michael J. Ballou, proprietor.\n I walked in the door and the beer smell reached out to embrace me. The crowd was light and the room was quiet. The jukebox was silent, and nobody was playing darts at the back. Burke was behind the bar with a cigarette in his mouth, trying to make his lighter produce a flame. As I came in he gave me a tiny nod, put down the lighter and lit the cigarette with a match.\n I didn\u0027t see his lips move but he must have said something because Mick turned at my approach. He was wearing his butcher\u0027s apron, more a coat than an apron. It buttoned up to the neck and covered him to the knees. It was gleaming white except where it showed reddish-brown stains. Some of them had faded over the years, and some had not.\n \"Scudder,\" he said. \"Good man. What will you drink?\"\n I said a Coke would be fine. Burke filled a glass and slid it across the bar to me. I picked it up, and Mick raised his own glass to me. He was drinking JJ\u0026S, the twelve-year-old Irish that the Jameson people turn out in small quantities. Billy Keegan, who\u0027d worked behind the stick at Armstrong\u0027s some years back, used to drink it, and I\u0027d tried it on a few occasions. I could still remember what it tasted like.\n \"It\u0027s a late hour for you,\" Mick said.\n \"I was afraid you might be closed.\"\n \"When did we ever close at this hour? It\u0027s not two yet. We\u0027re open till four, as often as not. I bought this bar to have a place for late drinking. Sometimes a man has need of a late night.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Are you all right, man?\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"You look like a man who\u0027s been in a fight.\"\n I had to smile. \"This afternoon,\" I said, \"but it didn\u0027t put a mark on me. A few nights ago it was a different story.\"\n \"Oh?\"\n \"Maybe we should sit down.\"\n \"Maybe we should,\" he agreed. He snatched up the whiskey bottle and led the way to a table. I brought my Coke and followed him. As we sat down, someone at the far end of the room played the jukebox and Liam Clancy declared himself to be a freeborn man of the traveling people. The volume was low and the music didn\u0027t get in your way, and neither of us said anything until the song had ended.\n Then I said, \"I need a gun.\"\n \"What sort of gun?\"\n \"A handgun. An automatic or a revolver, it doesn\u0027t matter. Something small enough to conceal and carry around but heavy enough to have some stopping power.\"\n His glass was still a third full, but he drew the cork stopper from the JJ\u0026S bottle and topped it up, then picked up the glass and looked into it. I wondered what he was seeing.\n He drank off some of the whiskey and put the glass down. \"Come on,\" he said.\n He stood up, pushed his chair back. I followed him to the back of the room. There was a door to the left of the dart board. Press-on letters announced that it was private, and a lock guaranteed privacy. Mick opened it with a key and ushered me into his office.\n It was a surprise. There was a big desk, its top completely clear. A Mosler safe as tall as I was stood off to one side, flanked by a pair of green metal filing cabinets. A brass coatrack held a raincoat and a couple of jackets. There were two groups of hand-colored engravings on the walls, some of Ireland, the others of France. He\u0027d told me once that his mother\u0027s people came from County Sligo, his father from a fishing village near Marseilles. Behind the desk there was a much larger picture, a black-and-white photograph with a white mat and a narrow black frame. It showed a white frame farmhouse shaded by tall trees, with hills in the distance and clouds in the sky.\n \"That\u0027s the farm,\" he said. \"You\u0027ve never been.\"\n \"No.\"\n \"We\u0027ll go one day. It\u0027s up near Ellenville. We should have snow soon. That\u0027s when I like it the most, when all those hills have snow on them.\"\n \"It must be beautiful.\"\n \"It is.\" He went to the safe, worked the combination lock, opened the door. I went over and examined one of the French engravings. It showed sailing boats in a small and well-protected harbor. I couldn\u0027t read the caption.\n I went on looking at it until I heard the door of the safe swing shut. I turned. He had a revolver in one hand and half a dozen shells in the palm of the other. I went over and he handed me the gun.\n \"It\u0027s a Smith,\" he said. \"Thirty-eight caliber, and the shells are hollow-point, so you won\u0027t lack for stopping power. As for accuracy, that\u0027s another matter. Someone\u0027s cut the barrel down to an inch, and of course that did for the front sight. The rear sight\u0027s been filed down, and so\u0027s the hammer, so you can\u0027t cock it, you have to fire it double-action. It\u0027ll go in your pocket and come free without snagging on the lining, but you won\u0027t win a turkey shoot with it. You can\u0027t really aim it, I don\u0027t think. You can only point it.\"\n \"That\u0027s all right.\"\n \"Will it do you, then?\"\n \"It\u0027ll do fine,\" I said. I turned the gun over in my hands, getting the feel of it, smelling the gun oil. There was no powder smell, so it had most likely been cleaned since its last firing.\n \"It\u0027s not loaded,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve only the six shells. I can make a phone call and get more.\"\n I shook my head. \"If I miss him six times,\" I said, \"I can forget the whole thing. He\u0027s not going to give me time to reload.\" I swung the cylinder out and began filling the chambers. You can make a case for leaving one chamber empty so you won\u0027t have a live shell under the hammer, but I figured I\u0027d rather have one more bullet in the gun. Besides, with the hammer filed down the possibility of an accidental discharge was slight.\n I asked Mick what I owed him.\n He shook his head. \"I\u0027m not in the business of selling guns,\" he said.\n \"Even so.\"\n \"I\u0027ve no money in it,\" he said. \"And no need to see money out of it. Bring it back if you don\u0027t use it. Failing that, forget about it.\"\n \"It\u0027s unregistered?\"\n \"As far as I know. Someone picked it up in a burglary. I couldn\u0027t tell you who owned it, but I doubt he registered it. The serial number\u0027s gone. A man who licenses his gun rarely files down the number. You\u0027re sure it\u0027ll do you?\"\n \"I\u0027m sure.\"\n We went back to the other room and he locked the office door. The same Liam Clancy record was playing as we returned to our table. The television set behind the bar was tuned to a western movie, and the sound was too low to carry past the three men watching it. I drank some Coke and Mick drank some Irish.\n He said, \"What I said before, that I\u0027m not in the gun business. I\u0027ve been in and out of that business in my day. Did you ever happen to hear the story of the three cases of Kalashnikovs?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Now this was some years ago. It might be long enough that I could tell it in court. It\u0027s seven years, isn\u0027t it? The statute of limitations?\"\n \"On most felonies. There\u0027s no statute of limitations on tax evasion or murder.\"\n \"Don\u0027t I know it.\" He picked up his glass and looked at it. \"Here\u0027s how it was. There were these three cases of Kalashnikovs. AK-47s, you know. Assault rifles. They were in a storage bin in Maspeth, just off Grand Avenue. Big crates they were, with more than thirty rifles in each, so you had close to a hundred in all.\"\n \"Whose were they?\"\n \"Ours, once we blew the lock on that storage shed. The crates were too large for the van we had. We broke them open and loaded the rifles into the back of the van. I don\u0027t know whose guns they were, but he couldn\u0027t own them legally, and he couldn\u0027t go to the police about it, could he?\" He took a drink. \"We already had a buyer for them. You wouldn\u0027t steal something like that if you didn\u0027t.\"\n \"Who was your buyer?\"\n \"Some lads who looked like Hitler\u0027s next of kin. Their heads this close to shaved, and the three I saw were dressed alike. Blue shirts with designs on the pocket and khaki trousers. They said they had a training camp in the Adirondacks, up around Tupper Lake. They wanted the guns, and they paid more than they had to, I\u0027ll say that for them.\"\n \"So you sold them.\"\n \"So I did. And two nights later I\u0027m having a drink at Morrissey\u0027s, and Tim Pat himself calls me aside. You remember Tim Pat Morrissey.\"\n \"Of course.\"\n \" \u0027I hear you\u0027ve a few extra rifles,\u0027 he says. \u0027Wherever did you hear that?\u0027 I say. Well, the whole of it is that he wants the lot of them for some friends of his in the north of Ireland. You knew they were involved in all of that, the brothers. Didn\u0027t you?\"\n \"I\u0027d certainly heard as much.\"\n \"Well, nothing would do but he must have these rifles. He won\u0027t believe I\u0027ve already sold them. He\u0027s sure I couldn\u0027t have moved them so quick, you see. \u0027You don\u0027t want them in this country,\u0027 he says. \u0027Think what your man may do with them.\u0027 Why, I said, he and his friend will go and play toy soldier with them, or at worst they\u0027ll go and shoot a few niggers. \u0027You don\u0027t know that,\u0027 he says. \u0027Maybe they\u0027ll start a revolution and storm the governor\u0027s mansion. Maybe they\u0027ll give the guns to the niggers. Sell them to me and you\u0027ll know where they\u0027re going.\u0027 \"\n He sighed. \"So we stole them back and sold them to Tim Pat. He wouldn\u0027t pay the price the little Nazis paid, either. What a bargainer he was! \u0027You\u0027re doing this for Holy Ireland,\u0027 he said, driving the price down. Still, when you collect twice for the same fucking guns, any price is a good price.\"\n \"Did the original buyers come back at you?\"\n \"Ah,\" he said. \"Now there\u0027s the part the statute of limitations doesn\u0027t cover. You might say they were in no position to retaliate.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-ticket-to-the-boneyard-matthew-scudder-8/page-33.html","bookId":2326,"book":{"id":2326,"title":"A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8)","description":"Storyline: \n A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8) \n The streets of New York are never safe, but the release of James Leo Motley, a psychopath who went down swearing revenge on Matt Scudder on all who knew him, means death is out there looking for a victim.
