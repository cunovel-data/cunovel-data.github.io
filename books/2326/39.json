{"id":63389,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"His hands moved, one settling on my upper arm, the other fastening on the back of my neck. He let his fingers look for hot spots now and he hadn\u0027t lost his touch. His thumb dug in behind my ear and the pain came in Technicolor.\\n\\n But it was somehow different. It was there, God knows, and it could not have been more intense, but this time I was able to feel it without feeling it. I was aware of it but unaffected by it. Something enabled me to allow it to pass through me and leave me whole.\\n\\n He shifted his grip, both of his hands on my neck now, the thumbs at the base of my ears, the fingers reaching to circle my throat. Maybe the pain wouldn\u0027t stop me, but if he shut off my air or blocked the flow of blood through the carotid I\u0027d be just as dead as if I died in agony.\\n\\n I went for his foot again. His grip loosened a little, and I crouched lower. He loomed over me, his hands finding their grip again, and I gathered my legs under me and thrust straight up, leading with the top of my head, using it as a battering ram.\\n\\n Some things don\u0027t change. He still had fingers like eagle\u0027s talons, the strongest I\u0027d ever encountered. And, thank God, he still had a glass jaw.\\n\\n I butted him a couple of times, but I think the first one was all it took. When I let go of him and took a step back he slid down the wall like a dead man. His long jaw was slack and saliva trailed from one corner of his mouth.\\n\\n I dragged him out into the middle of the room and cuffed him. I used the cuffs I\u0027d just bought to fasten his hands behind his back, and I used Echevarria\u0027s set, hanging from his belt in their leather case, to shackle his ankles together. I got my little tape recorder out of my pocket and made sure it still worked, then cued a cassette so I could start recording when he came to.\\n\\n Then I sat back and gave myself time to catch my breath. I started thinking about what would happen now. If Elaine lived, her testimony ought to be enough to ensure conviction. If she died-\\n\\n I called New York Hospital and they put me through to the ICU. Her condition was critical, they told me. That was all I could get from them over the phone.\\n\\n But she was still alive.\\n\\n If she died, the doorman could identify Motley. And, once the department put its full resources into the case, any of a number of witnesses might turn up to put him on the scene when Echevarria got stabbed, when Elizabeth Scudder was butchered, when Toni Cleary went out the window. No end of physical evidence might come to light if enough trained personnel looked in the right places for it. And a full-scale investigation in New York would almost certainly tip the balance in Massillon, where Tom Havlicek\u0027s chief would okay reopening the Sturdevant case. And Ohio was a death penalty state, wasn\u0027t it?\\n\\n Still, a confession would make a big difference. All I had to do was wait until he came to and get him talking. No question the bastard liked to talk.\\n\\n He was lying facedown, his hands cuffed behind him. I rolled him over onto his back and lifted an eyelid with my thumb. His eye was rolled way back up into its socket, with only the white part showing. He was out cold, and looked as though he\u0027d be out for a while.\\n\\n I went and got the Smith. I looked at it and I looked at him. I thought of everything he\u0027d done and I looked within myself, trying to summon up the hate I felt for him. But it didn\u0027t seem to be there. At least it wasn\u0027t anywhere that I could find it.\\n\\n And that had been oddly true a few minutes ago, when he had been far removed from the inert bundle in the middle of the floor. I had been very literally fighting for my life, and all the same I\u0027d been oddly calm, and fresh out of hate and anger. I hadn\u0027t hated him then. I didn\u0027t seem to hate him now.\\n\\n I put the gun to his temple and let my finger test the tension in the trigger. I withdrew my finger from the trigger and put the gun down on the floor.\\n\\n I thought it all over. I must have spent several minutes running it through my mind. Then I took a breath deep enough to hurt my ribs, and then I let it all out, and then I picked up the Smith and broke it open.\\n\\n I unloaded all six chambers. I got out my handkerchief and wiped off the bullets and the gun itself, cleaning every surface that might have held a print. Then I made sure he wasn\u0027t playing possum before removing the cuffs from his wrists. I took hold of his fingers and touched them to the bullets, then loaded them back into the gun.\\n\\n I put the gun down and took hold of him under the arms. I dragged him a few yards, then hauled him onto his feet and dropped him in the needlepoint chair. He started to slide back onto the floor but I pulled him up into a seated position and balanced him there. I went back for the Smith, wiped it again with the handkerchief, and fitted it into his right hand. I slipped his finger inside the trigger guard. With my own left hand I worked his jaw to get his mouth open, and then I got the short barrel of the little revolver between his teeth.\\n\\n I made sure I had the angle right. Cops eat their guns all the time, it\u0027s their favorite single method of committing suicide, and sometimes they miss, sometimes the bullet goes on through without doing mortal damage. I wanted to do this properly, and I was only going to get one chance. I wanted the bullet to go right up through the roof of the mouth and into the brain.\\n\\n When I had the gun the way I wanted it, I just stayed in position for a moment. There was something I seemed to want to say, but whom was I going to say it to?\\n\\n I thought, Say it to him. And I remembered what the ICU nurse had told me. According to her, patients in coma understood what was said to them.\\n\\n I said, \"I\u0027m not sure this is a good idea. But suppose you got out again. Suppose your lawyer pulled off some kind of half-assed insanity defense. Or suppose you went away for life and escaped. How can I take that kind of chance?\"\\n\\n I paused for a moment, then shook my head. \"I\u0027m not even sure that\u0027s it. I just don\u0027t want you to be alive anymore.\\n\\n \"And I want to be the one who sees to it, and that\u0027s how all this shit started in the first place, isn\u0027t it? I had to play God and frame you for attempted murder. What would have happened if I\u0027d just let things take their course back then? Would it have made a difference?\"\\n\\n I waited, as if he might answer. Then I said, \"And here I am playing God again. I know better and I\u0027m doing it anyway.\"\\n\\n That was all I said. I stayed there at his side, down on one knee, the gun in his mouth, his finger on the trigger, my finger on his. I don\u0027t know how long I waited, or what I was waiting for.\\n\\n Eventually his breathing changed slightly and he started to stir. My finger moved, and so did his, and that was that.\\n\\n I set the stage before I left. I got Echevarria\u0027s cuffs loose from Motley\u0027s ankles and returned them to the case on his belt. I righted the table that had gotten upended earlier and straightened out other articles disturbed during our struggle. I went around the apartment, handkerchief in hand, and removed my prints from every surface where I might have left them.\\n\\n While I was doing this, I picked up a lipstick tube from the dresser in the bedroom and used it to leave a last message on the living-room wall. In block caps three inches tall I printed, it has to end. i make my peace with god. sorry i kill so many. You couldn\u0027t prove it was his writing, but I couldn\u0027t see how you could prove that it wasn\u0027t. Just to keep it neat I capped the lipstick tube, got his prints on it, and tucked it into his shirt pocket.\\n\\n I fastened the chain lock on the apartment\u0027s front door and left the same way I\u0027d come in, via the window. This time I drew it all the way shut after me. I went down the fire escape, lowered the ladder, descended it. Someone had moved the garbage can to its original position, so I had to drop the last few feet, but that was easy enough.\\n\\n Someone had also removed my topcoat. I thought at first someone had walked off with it, but something made me lift the lid of one of the garbage cans and there it was, reposing under a layer of eggshells and orange peels. The person who\u0027d put it there had evidently assumed it had been discarded, and decided further that it wasn\u0027t worth rescuing. It had been a perfectly respectable coat, or at least I\u0027d thought so, but now I figured it was time to buy myself a new one.\\n\\n I thought the same conscientious tenant who\u0027d tossed my topcoat might have removed my toothpick from the lock, but it was still in place and all I had to do was draw the door open. I retrieved the toothpick and let the door lock behind me, went on out through the front of the building, and walked over to First Avenue where I caught a cab headed uptown. I got out at the hospital\u0027s main entrance and went directly to the ICU. The nurse said Elaine\u0027s condition was unchanged but wouldn\u0027t let me go in to see her. I sat down in the waiting room and tried to look at a magazine.\\n\\n I would have liked to pray but I couldn\u0027t think how to go about it. AA meetings generally close with either the Lord\u0027s Prayer or the serenity prayer, but neither seemed especially appropriate at the moment, and giving thanks for everything just as it was felt like a joke, and not a very tasteful one. In the course of things I did say some prayers, even including that one, but I don\u0027t really think anyone was listening.\\n\\n Every now and then I would go to the desk, only to be told that nothing had changed and that she couldn\u0027t have anyone in the room with her just yet. Then I\u0027d go back to the waiting room and wait some more. I dozed off in my chair a couple of times but never got deeper than a sort of waking dream state.\\n\\n Around five in the afternoon I got hungry, which wasn\u0027t too surprising given that I hadn\u0027t had anything since Mick and I ate breakfast. I got some change and bought coffee and sandwiches from machines in the lobby. I couldn\u0027t manage more than half a sandwich, but the coffee was good. It wasn\u0027t good coffee, not by any stretch of the imagination, but it was good to get it inside me.\\n\\n Two hours after that a nurse came in with a grave expression on her pale face. \"Maybe you\u0027d better see her now,\" she said.\\n\\n On the way I asked her what she meant by that. She said it looked as though they were losing her.\\n\\n I went in and stood at her bedside. She didn\u0027t look any better or any worse than she had before. I picked up her hand and held it and waited for her to die.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s dead,\" I told her. There were nurses around but I don\u0027t think any of them could hear me. They were too busy to listen. Anyway, I didn\u0027t care what they heard. \"I killed him,\" I told her. \"You don\u0027t ever have to worry about him again.\"\\n\\n I suppose you can believe people in comas hear what\u0027s said to them. You can believe God hears prayers, too, if that\u0027s what you want. Whatever makes you happy.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t go, anywhere,\" I told her. \"Don\u0027t die, baby. Please don\u0027t die.\"\\n\\n I must have been with her for half an hour before one of the nurses told me to return to the waiting room. A few hours after that another nurse came in and talked some about Elaine\u0027s medical condition. I don\u0027t remember what she said and didn\u0027t understand much of it at the time, but the gist of it was that she had passed a crisis, but that an infinite number of crises lay ahead of her. She could develop pneumonia, she could throw an embolism, she could go into liver or kidney failure- there were so many ways she could die that it seemed impossible for her to dodge them all.\\n\\n \"You might as well go home,\" she said. \"There\u0027s nothing you can do, and we have your number, we\u0027ll call you if anything happens.\"\\n\\n I went home and slept. In the morning I called and was told that her condition was about the same. I showered and shaved and got dressed and went over there. I was there all morning and part of the afternoon, and then I rode a crosstown bus through the park and went to Toni\u0027s memorial service at Roosevelt. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-ticket-to-the-boneyard-matthew-scudder-8/page-39.html","bookId":2326,"book":{"id":2326,"title":"A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8)","description":"Storyline: A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8) \\n The streets of New York are never safe, but the release of James Leo Motley, a psychopath who went down swearing revenge on Matt Scudder on all who knew him, means death is out there looking for a victim.
