{"id":63356,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Two days into it, Motley called. She answered in the living room and I picked up the extension in the bedroom. The conversation went something like this:\\n\\n Motley: Hello, Elaine.\\n\\n Elaine: Oh, hello.\\n\\n Motley: You know who this is.\\n\\n Elaine: Yes.\\n\\n Motley: I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to make sure you were all right.\\n\\n Elaine: Uh-huh.\\n\\n Motley: Well? Are you?\\n\\n Elaine: Am I what?\\n\\n Motley: Are you all right?\\n\\n Elaine: I guess so.\\n\\n Motley: Good.\\n\\n Elaine: Are you-\\n\\n Motley: Am I what?\\n\\n Elaine: Are you coming over?\\n\\n Motley: Why?\\n\\n Elaine: I just wondered.\\n\\n Motley: Do you want me to come over?\\n\\n Elaine: Well, I\u0027m all alone. It\u0027s sort of lonesome here.\\n\\n Motley: You could go out.\\n\\n Elaine: I haven\u0027t felt like it.\\n\\n Motley: No, you\u0027ve been staying home all the time, haven\u0027t you? Are you afraid to go out?\\n\\n Elaine: I guess so.\\n\\n Motley: What are you afraid of?\\n\\n Elaine: I don\u0027t know.\\n\\n Motley: Speak up. I can\u0027t hear you.\\n\\n Elaine: I said I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m afraid of.\\n\\n Motley: Are you afraid of me?\\n\\n Elaine: Yes.\\n\\n Motley: That\u0027s good. I\u0027m glad to hear that. I\u0027m not coming over now.\\n\\n Elaine: Oh.\\n\\n Motley: But I\u0027ll be over in a day or two. And I\u0027ll give you what you need, Elaine. I always give you what you need, don\u0027t I?\\n\\n Elaine: I wish you would come over.\\n\\n Motley: Soon, Elaine.\\n\\n When he\u0027d hung up I went back to the living room. She was on the leather sofa and she looked exhausted. She said, \"I felt like a bird charmed by a snake. I was acting, of course. Trying to make him think he\u0027d broken my spirit and he really did own me, body and soul. Do you think he bought it?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"Neither do I. It sounded as though he did, but maybe he was acting, too, playing my game with me. He knows I haven\u0027t left the apartment. Maybe he\u0027s watching it.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s possible.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe he\u0027s perched up somewhere with a pair of binoculars, maybe he can see in my fucking windows. You know something? I was pretending, but I wound up half convincing myself. It\u0027s like the rapture of the depths, it would be so goddamned easy to let go of my will and just drown. You know what I mean?\"\\n\\n \"I think so.\"\\n\\n \"How do you suppose he got in? The other day, when I was fucking Whatsisname at the Sherry. He got past the doorman and then he got in the door. How did he do that?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not that hard to get past a doorman.\"\\n\\n \"I know, but they\u0027re pretty good here. And what about the door? You said there weren\u0027t any signs of forced entry.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe he had a key.\"\\n\\n \"How would he get a key? I for sure didn\u0027t give him one, and I\u0027m not missing any.\"\\n\\n \"Did Connie have a key to your place?\"\\n\\n \"What for, to water the plants? No, nobody had a key. You don\u0027t even have a key. You don\u0027t, do you? I never gave you one, did I?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"I certainly never gave one to Connie. How did he get in? I\u0027ve got a good lock on that door.\"\\n\\n \"Did you lock it with the key when you left?\"\\n\\n \"I think so. I always do.\"\\n\\n \"Because if you didn\u0027t engage the deadbolt he could have loided his way with a credit card. Or maybe he picked up your key long enough to make an impression in wax or soap. Or maybe he picks locks.\"\\n\\n \"Or maybe he just used his fingertips,\" she offered, \"and pushed the door open.\"\\n\\n My fourth night there, the phone rang at a quarter to four. I\u0027d gone to sleep some two hours earlier, my gut full of Early Times and my whole system ragged with cabin fever. I heard the phone ring and willed myself awake, but my will wasn\u0027t strong enough to push through the fog. I thought I was awake but my body stayed in Elaine\u0027s bed and my mind in some sort of dream, and then Elaine was shaking me and urging me awake, and I threw back the covers and got my legs over the side of the bed.\\n\\n \"That was him on the phone,\" she said. \"He\u0027s coming over.\" I asked what time it was and she told me. \"I said give me an hour, a girl wants to look her best. He said half an hour, that should be plenty of time for me. He\u0027s on his way, Matt. What do we do now?\"\\n\\n I had her call the doorman and let him know she was expecting a guest. Send Mr. Motley right up, she told him, but be sure to ring and tell her he was on his way. She hung up and went into the bathroom, stood under the shower for two minutes, toweled off and started to get dressed. I don\u0027t remember what she chose, but she tried on a couple of different outfits, complaining about her own indecision all the while.\\n\\n \"This is crazy,\" she said. \"You\u0027d think I was getting ready for a date.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you are.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, a fucking date with destiny. Are you all right?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a little slow off the mark,\" I admitted. \"Maybe you could get some coffee going.\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n I got dressed, putting on the clothes I\u0027d taken off two hours ago, the clothes I\u0027d been wearing for the better part of a week. I generally wore a suit on the job in those days- I still do, more often than not- and I put it on. I had trouble getting my tie tied right and made two attempts before the inanity of it struck me and I pulled the tie out from under my collar and tossed it on a chair.\\n\\n I had the.38 the city issued me in a shoulder holster. I drew it once or twice, then took off the jacket and the holster and wedged the gun under my belt, the butt nestled in the small of my back.\\n\\n The bourbon bottle was on the table next to the bed. It was a fifth, and there was maybe half a pint left in it. I uncapped it and took a short pull straight from the bottle. Just a quick one, to get the old heart started.\\n\\n I called to Elaine but she didn\u0027t answer. I put my suit jacket back on and practiced drawing the gun. The movement felt awkward, which can happen with any movement when you rehearse it to death. I moved the gun to the left side of my abdomen and practiced a crosshanded draw, but I liked that even less, and I thought about trying the shoulder holster again.\\n\\n Maybe I wouldn\u0027t have to draw it. Maybe I could just keep the thing in my hand. We hadn\u0027t choreographed this show yet, hadn\u0027t decided where I was going to be when she let him in. I thought the simplest thing might be if I waited behind the door when she opened it, then stepped out with a drawn gun once he was inside. But maybe it made more sense to give him a little time alone with her first, while I waited in the kitchen or the bedroom for the right moment. There looked to be a psychological advantage in that, but there was more room in the script for something to go wrong. Her anxiety might tip him off, say, or he might just decide to do something weird. Crazy people, after all, are apt to do crazy things. It\u0027s their trademark.\\n\\n I called her name again but evidently she had the water running and didn\u0027t hear me. I put the gun under my belt again, then drew it out and walked down the short hallway to the living room carrying it in my hand. I wanted coffee, if it was ready, and I wanted to work out how we were going to play the scene.\\n\\n I walked into the living room and turned toward the kitchen and stopped in my tracks, because he was standing there with his back to the window and Elaine at his side and a little in front of him. He had one hand on her arm, just above the elbow, and with the other he was gripping her wrist.\\n\\n He said, \"Put the gun down. Now, right this minute, or I\u0027ll break her arm.\"\\n\\n The gun wasn\u0027t pointed at him, and I wasn\u0027t holding it right, I didn\u0027t have my finger anywhere near the trigger. I was holding it in my hand the way you\u0027d hold a plate of hors d\u0027oeuvres.\\n\\n I put the gun down.\\n\\n She had described him well, the long angular body, spare of flesh but tight as a coiled spring, the narrow face, the eccentric haircut. Someone had used a clippers on everything outside the perimeter of the soup bowl, and his hair perched on his head like a skullcap. His nose was long, and fleshy at the tip, and his lips were quite full. His forehead sloped back, and beneath it his eyes were set deep under a prominent ridge of brow. The eyes were a sort of muddy brown, and I couldn\u0027t read anything in them.\\n\\n His features and his hairstyle combined to give him a faintly medieval look, like an evil friar, but his clothes didn\u0027t fit the part. He wore an olive corduroy sport jacket with leather piping at the cuffs and lapels and tooled leather patches on the elbows. His pants were khaki, with a knife-edge crease, and he was wearing lizard boots with one-inch heels and silver caps on their pointed toes. His shirt was western style, with snaps instead of buttons, and he had one of those string ties with a turquoise slide.\\n\\n \"You must be Scudder,\" he said. \"The pimping cop. Elaine wanted to let you know I was here, but I thought it would be nicer to surprise you. I told her I was sure you were a man who enjoyed surprises. I told Elaine not to make a sound, and so she didn\u0027t make a sound, not even when I hurt her. She does what I tell her. Do you know why?\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because she\u0027s beginning to realize I know what\u0027s best for her. I know what she needs.\"\\n\\n His pallor was such that he didn\u0027t look to have any blood in his body. Beside him, Elaine was a matching shade; the blood had drained out of her face, and her strength and resolve looked to have gone with it. She looked like a zombie in a horror movie.\\n\\n \"I know what she needs,\" he said again, \"and what she doesn\u0027t need is a dull-witted cop to pimp for her.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not her pimp.\"\\n\\n \"Oh? What are you then? Her lawfully wedded husband? Her demon lover? Her twin brother, separated from her at birth? Her long-lost bastard son? Tell me what you are.\"\\n\\n It\u0027s funny what you notice. I kept looking at his hands. They still gripped her arm at the wrist and above the elbow. She\u0027d told me how much strength he had in his hands, and I didn\u0027t doubt her word, but they didn\u0027t look that strong. They were large hands and his fingers were long, and knobby at the knuckle joints. The fingernails were short, clipped clear to the quick, and they had well-defined moons at their bases.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m her friend,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m her friend,\" he said. \"I\u0027m her friends and her family.\" He paused for a moment, as if to relish the sound of that statement. He looked as though he liked it well enough. \"She doesn\u0027t need anyone else. She certainly doesn\u0027t need you.\" He smiled just enough to show his prominent front teeth. They were large and slightly bucked. Horse teeth. Briskly he said, \"Your services are no longer required. Your period of employment is terminated. You\u0027re out on your ass, you piece of shit. She doesn\u0027t want you around. Don\u0027t just stand there, with your face hanging out like bloomers on a tenement washline. Go. Scat!\"\\n\\n \"Well, I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I\u0027m here at Elaine\u0027s invitation, not yours. Now if she wants me to leave-\"\\n\\n \"Tell him, Elaine.\"\\n\\n \"Matt-\"\\n\\n \"Tell him.\"\\n\\n \"Matt, maybe you\u0027d better go.\"\\n\\n I looked at her, trying to cue her with my eyes. \"Do you really want me to leave?\"\\n\\n \"I think you\u0027d better.\"\\n\\n I hesitated for a beat, then shrugged. \"Whatever you say,\" I said, and moved toward the table where I\u0027d set the gun down.\\n\\n \"Hold it! What do you think you\u0027re doing?\"\\n\\n \"What does it look like I\u0027m doing? I\u0027m getting my gun.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t allow that.\"\\n\\n \"Then I don\u0027t see how the hell I can leave,\" I said, reasonably. \"That\u0027s my service revolver, and I\u0027d be in shit up to my ears if I left it here.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-ticket-to-the-boneyard-matthew-scudder-8/page-6.html","bookId":2326,"book":{"id":2326,"title":"A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8)","description":"Storyline: A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8) \\n The streets of New York are never safe, but the release of James Leo Motley, a psychopath who went down swearing revenge on Matt Scudder on all who knew him, means death is out there looking for a victim.
