Elaine Mardell.\" \"A pleasure,\" Ballou said. \"Matthew, I\u0027ve been saying I wished you would come by, and here you are and I have to be off. Come back again, will you?\" \"I will.\" \"We\u0027ll tell tales all night and go to mass in the morning. Miss Mardell, I\u0027ll hope to see you again as well.\" He turned away. Almost as an afterthought he raised his glass and drained it. On his way out he left the glass on an empty table. After the door closed behind him Elaine said, \"I wasn\u0027t prepared for the size of him. He\u0027s huge, isn\u0027t he? He looks like one of those statues on Easter Island.\" \"I know.\" \"Rough-hewn from granite. What did he mean about going to mass in the morning? Is that code for something?\" I shook my head. \"His father was a meatcutter in the Washington Street market. Every once in a while Mick likes to put on his father\u0027s old apron and go to the eight o\u0027clock mass at St. Bernard\u0027s.\" \"And you go with him?\" \"I did once.\" \"You bring a girl to the most remarkable places,\" she said, \"and introduce her to the most remarkable people.\" Outside again, she said, \"You live near here, don\u0027t you, Matt? You can just put me in a cab. I\u0027ll be all right.\" \"I\u0027ll see you home.\" \"You don\u0027t have to.\" \"I don\u0027t mind.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Positive,\" I said. \"Besides, I\u0027m going to need that sketch Galindez made. I want to get it photocopied first thing in the morning and start showing it to people.\" \"Oh, right.\" There were plenty of cabs now, and I flagged one and we rode across town in silence. Her doorman opened the cab door for us, then hurried ahead to hold the door to the lobby. As we rode up in the elevator she said, \"You could have had the cab wait.\" \"There are cabs all over the place.\" \"That\u0027s true.\" \"It\u0027s easier to get another one than pay his waiting time. Besides, I might walk home.\" \"At this hour?\" \"Sure.\" \"It\u0027s a long walk.\" \"I like long walks.\" She unfastened both locks, the Segal deadbolt and the Fox police lock, and when we were inside she fastened them all again, the two she\u0027d just unlocked and the other, the police lock that could only be engaged from inside. It was a lot to go through given that I was going to be leaving in a minute, but I was pleased to see her do it. I wanted her to get in the habit of setting all the locks the minute she walked into the place. And not just most of the time. All of the time. \"Don\u0027t forget the cab,\" she said. \"What about the cab?\" \"All the cabs,\" she said. \"You want to keep track, so I can reimburse you.\" \"Oh, for Christ\u0027s sake,\" I said. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"I can\u0027t bother with that kind of chickenshit,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t go through that when I have a client.\" \"What do you do?\" \"I set some kind of arbitrary flat rate and it includes my expenses. I can\u0027t make myself keep receipts and write down every time I get on the subway. It drives me crazy.\" \"What about when you do a day\u0027s work for Reliable?\" \"I keep track as well as I can, and it makes me a little bit nuts, but I put up with it because I have to. I may be done working for them anyway, after the conversation I had with one of the bosses this morning.\" \"What happened?\" \"It\u0027s not important. He was a little miffed that I was taking some time off, and I\u0027m not sure he\u0027ll want me back when it\u0027s over. Then again, I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ll want to go back.\" \"Well, you\u0027ll work it out,\" she said. She walked over to the coffee table, picked up a little bronze statue of a cat, and turned it over in her hands. \"I don\u0027t mean keep receipts,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t mean itemize everything to the penny. I just want you to get paid back for whatever out-of-pocket expenses you have. I don\u0027t care how you arrive at a figure, just so you don\u0027t cheat yourself.\" \"I understand.\" She walked over to the window, still passing the little cat from hand to hand. I moved alongside her and we looked at Queens together. \"Someday,\" I said, \"all of this will be yours.\" \"Funny man. I want to thank you for tonight.\" \"No thanks are due.\" \"I think they are. You saved me from a severe case of cabin fever. I had to get out of here, but it was more than that. I had a good time.\" \"So did I.\" \"Well, I\u0027m grateful. Taking me to places in your neighborhood, Paris Green and Grogan\u0027s. You didn\u0027t have to let me into your world like that.\" \"I had at least as good a time as you did,\" I said. \"And it doesn\u0027t exactly hurt my image to be seen with a beautiful woman on my arm.\" \"I\u0027m not beautiful.\" \"The hell you\u0027re not. What do you want, reassurance? You must know what you look like.\" \"I know I\u0027m not a bow-wow,\" she said. \"But I\u0027m certainly not beautiful.\" \"Oh, come on. How\u0027d you get all those houses across the river?\" \"You don\u0027t have to look like Elizabeth Taylor to make it in life, for God\u0027s sake. You ought to know that. You just have to be a person a man\u0027ll want to spend time with. I\u0027ll tell you a secret. It\u0027s mental work.\" \"Whatever you say.\" She turned away, put the cat back on the coffee table. With her back to me she said, \"Do you really think I\u0027m beautiful?\" \"I\u0027ve always thought so.\" \"That\u0027s so sweet.\" \"I\u0027m not trying to be sweet. I just-\" \"I know.\" Neither of us said anything for a moment, and the room turned deeply silent. There had been a moment like that in the film we saw, when the music stopped and the sound track went soundless. It heightened the suspense, as I recall. I said, \"I\u0027d better take that sketch.\" \"You\u0027d better. I want to put it in something, though, so it won\u0027t smudge. Let me go pee first, okay?\" While she was gone, I stood in the middle of the room looking at James Leo Motley as Ray Galindez had drawn him and trying to read the expression in his eyes. That didn\u0027t make much sense, given that I was looking at an artist\u0027s drawing instead of a photo, and that Motley\u0027s eyes had been opaque and unreadable even in person. I wondered what he was doing out there. Maybe he was holed up in an abandoned building sucking on a crack pipe. Maybe he was living with a woman, hurting her with the tips of his fingers, taking her money, telling her she liked it. Maybe he was out of town, shooting craps in Atlantic City, lying on a beach in Miami. I went on gazing at the sketch, trying to let my old animal instincts tell me where he was and what he was doing, and Elaine returned to the room and moved to stand beside me. I felt the gentle pressure of her shoulder against my side and breathed in her scent. She said, \"I thought a cardboard tube. That way you wouldn\u0027t have to fold it, you could just roll it, and it won\u0027t get smudged.\" \"How do you happen to have a cardboard tube on hand? I thought you didn\u0027t keep stuff.\" \"I don\u0027t, but if I pull the rest of the paper towels off the roll I\u0027ll have a tube.\" \"Clever.\" \"I thought so.\" \"If you think it\u0027s worth it.\" \"How much is a roll of paper towels? A buck nineteen, something like that?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Well, it\u0027s something like that. Of course it\u0027s worth it.\" She extended a forefinger, touched the sketch. \"When this is over,\" she said, \"I want this.\" \"What for?\" \"I want it matted and framed. Remember what he said, \u0027Suitable for framing\u0027? He was joking, but that\u0027s because he doesn\u0027t take his work seriously yet. This is art.\" \"You\u0027re serious.\" \"You bet I am. I should have gotten him to sign it. Maybe I\u0027ll get in touch with him later, ask him if he\u0027d be willing. What do you think?\" \"I think he\u0027d be flattered. Listen, I was going to have a few Xerox copies made, but now you\u0027re giving me ideas. What I\u0027ll do is I\u0027ll run an edition of fifty and number them.\" \"Very funny,\" she said. She moved her hand and laid it gently on top of mine. \"Funny man.\" \"That\u0027s me.\" \"Uh-huh.\" There was more of that utter silence, and I cleared my throat to break it. \"You put perfume on,\" I said. \"Yes, I did.\" \"Just now?\" \"Uh-huh.\" \"It smells nice.\" \"I\u0027m glad you like it.\" I turned to put the sketch on the table, then straightened up again. My arm moved around her waist and my hand settled on her hip. She sighed almost imperceptibly and leaned against me, her head on my shoulder. \"I feel beautiful,\" she said. \"You should.\" \"I didn\u0027t just put on perfume,\" she said. \"I got undressed.\" \"You\u0027re dressed now.\" \"Yes, I am. But before I was wearing a bra and panties, and now I\u0027m not. So it\u0027s just me under these clothes.\" \"Just you.\" \"Just me and a little perfume.\" She swung around to face me. \"And I brushed my teeth,\" she said, tilting her head, looking up at me with her lips slightly parted. Her eyes held mine for a moment, and then she closed them. I took her in my arms. It was quite wonderful, urgent yet unhurried, passionate yet comfortable, familiar yet surprising. We had the ease of old lovers and the eagerness of new ones. We had always been good together, and the years had been kind. We were better than ever. Afterward she said, \"I was thinking about this all night. I thought, gee, I like this guy, I always liked him, and wouldn\u0027t it be nice to find out if the gears still mesh after all these years. So in a manner of speaking I had this planned, but it was all in the mind. Do you know what I mean?\" \"I think so.\" \"My mind was excited at the prospect. Then you told me I was beautiful and all of a sudden I\u0027m standing there with wet panties.\" \"Honestly?\" \"Yeah, instant arousal. Like magic.\" \"The way to a woman\u0027s heart-\" \"Is through her panties. Can\u0027t you see new worlds opening up for you? All you have to do is tell us we\u0027re beautiful.\" She put her hand on my arm. \"I think the reason it worked is you made me believe it. Not that I am, but that you think I am.\" \"You are.\" \"That\u0027s your story,\" she said, \"and you stick to it. You know that story about Pinocchio? The girl sits on his face and says, \u0027Lie to me, lie to me.\u0027 \" \"When did I ever lie to you?\" \"Ah, baby,\" she said, \"I figured it\u0027d be fun to do this, and I knew it was going to happen one of these days, but who would have guessed we\u0027d be so hot for each other?\" \"I know.\" \"When was the last time we were together like this? The last time you were over here was three years ago, but we didn\u0027t go to bed then.\" \"No, it was a few years before then.\" \"So it could have been seven years ago?\" \"Maybe even eight.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-ticket-to-the-boneyard-matthew-scudder-8/page-15.html","bookId":2326,"book":{"id":2326,"title":"A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8)","description":"Storyline: A Ticket to the Boneyard (Matthew Scudder #8) The streets of New York are never safe, but the release of James Leo Motley, a psychopath who went down swearing revenge on Matt Scudder on all who knew him, means death is out there looking for a victim.
