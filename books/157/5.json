\n [bbe] Why have we gone from your memory for ever? why have you been turned away from us for so long? \n 5:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 使 我 们 向 你 回 转 ， 我 们 便 得 回 转 。 求 你 复 新 我 们 的 日 子 ， 像 古 时 一 样 。 \n [kjv] Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old. \n [bbe] Make us come back to you, O Lord, and let us be turned; make our days new again as in the past. \n 5:22 [hgb] 你 竟 全 然 弃 绝 我 们 ， 向 我 们 大 发 烈 怒 。 \n [kjv] But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us. \n [bbe] But you have quite given us up; you are full of wrath against us. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/131/1968.html","bookId":157,"book":{"id":157,"title":"耶利米哀歌 Lamentations","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 先 前 满 有 人 民 的 城 ， 现 在 何 竟 独 坐 。 先 前 在 列 国 中 为 大 的 ， 现 在 竟 如 寡 妇 。 先 前 在 诸 省 中 为 王 后 的 ， 现 在 成 为 进 贡 的 。 [kjv] How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/131","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
