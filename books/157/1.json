{"id":4497,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"1:1 [hgb] 先 前 满 有 人 民 的 城 ， 现 在 何 竟 独 坐 。 先 前 在 列 国 中 为 大 的 ， 现 在 竟 如 寡 妇 。 先 前 在 诸 省 中 为 王 后 的 ， 现 在 成 为 进 贡 的 。 [kjv] How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary! [bbe] See her seated by herself, the town which was full of people! She who was great among the nations has become like a widow! She who was a princess among the countries has come under the yoke of forced work! 1:2 [hgb] 她 夜 间 痛 哭 ， 泪 流 满 腮 。 在 一 切 所 亲 爱 的 中 间 没 有 一 个 安 慰 她 的 。 她 的 朋 友 都 以 诡 诈 待 她 ， 成 为 她 的 仇 敌 。 [kjv] She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies. [bbe] She is sorrowing bitterly in the night, and her face is wet with weeping; among all her lovers she has no comforter: all her friends have been false to her, they have become her haters. 1:3 [hgb] 犹 大 因 遭 遇 苦 难 ， 又 因 多 服 劳 苦 就 迁 到 外 邦 。 她 住 在 列 国 中 ， 寻 不 着 安 息 。 追 逼 她 的 都 在 狭 窄 之 地 将 她 追 上 。 [kjv] Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her between the straits. [bbe] Judah has been taken away as a prisoner because of trouble and hard work; her living-place is among the nations, there is no rest for her: all her attackers have overtaken her in a narrow place. 1:4 [hgb] 锡 安 的 路 径 因 无 人 来 守 圣 节 就 悲 伤 。 她 的 城 门 凄 凉 。 她 的 祭 司 叹 息 。 她 的 处 女 受 艰 难 ， 自 己 也 愁 苦 。 [kjv] The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness. [bbe] The ways of Zion are sad, because no one comes to the holy meeting; all her doorways are made waste, her priests are breathing out sorrow: her virgins are troubled, and it is bitter for her. 1:5 [hgb] 她 的 敌 人 为 首 。 她 的 仇 敌 亨 通 。 因 耶 和 华 为 她 许 多 的 罪 过 使 她 受 苦 。 她 的 孩 童 被 敌 人 掳 去 。 [kjv] Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy. [bbe] Those who are against her have become the head, everything goes well for her haters; for the Lord has sent sorrow on her because of the great number of her sins: her young children have gone away as prisoners before the attacker. 1:6 [hgb] 锡 安 城 的 威 荣 （ 城 原 文 作 女 子 下 同 ） 全 都 失 去 。 她 的 首 领 像 找 不 着 草 场 的 鹿 。 在 追 赶 的 人 前 无 力 行 走 。 [kjv] And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer. [bbe] And all her glory has gone from the daughter of Zion: her rulers have become like harts with no place for food, and they have gone in flight without strength before the attacker. 1:7 [hgb] 耶 路 撒 冷 在 困 苦 窘 迫 之 时 ， 就 追 想 古 时 一 切 的 乐 境 。 她 百 姓 落 在 敌 人 手 中 ， 无 人 救 济 。 敌 人 看 见 ， 就 因 她 的 荒 凉 嗤 笑 。 [kjv] Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversaries saw her, and did mock at her sabbaths. [bbe] Jerusalem keeps in mind, in the days of her sorrow and of her wanderings, all the desired things which were hers in days gone by; when her people came into the power of her hater and she had no helper, her attackers saw their desire effected on her and made sport of her destruction. 1:8 [hgb] 耶 路 撒 冷 大 大 犯 罪 ， 所 以 成 为 不 洁 之 物 。 素 来 尊 敬 她 的 ， 见 她 赤 露 就 都 藐 视 她 。 她 自 己 也 叹 息 退 后 。 [kjv] Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward. [bbe] Great is the sin of Jerusalem; for this cause she has become an unclean thing: all those who gave her honour are looking down on her, because they have seen her shame: now truly, breathing out grief, she is turned back. 1:9 [hgb] 她 的 污 秽 是 在 衣 襟 上 。 她 不 思 想 自 己 的 结 局 ， 所 以 非 常 地 败 落 ， 无 人 安 慰 她 。 她 说 ， 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 看 我 的 苦 难 ， 因 为 仇 敌 夸 大 。 [kjv] Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself. [bbe] In her skirts were her unclean ways; she gave no thought to her end; and her fall has been a wonder; she has no comforter: see her sorrow, O Lord; for the attacker is lifted up. 1:10 [hgb] 敌 人 伸 手 ， 夺 取 她 的 美 物 。 她 眼 见 外 邦 人 进 入 她 的 圣 所 论 这 外 邦 人 ， 你 曾 吩 咐 不 可 入 你 的 会 中 。 [kjv] The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation. [bbe] The hand of her hater is stretched out over all her desired things; for she has seen that the nations have come into her holy place, about whom you gave orders that they were not to come into the meeting of your people. 1:11 [hgb] 她 的 民 都 叹 息 ， 寻 求 食 物 。 他 们 用 美 物 换 粮 食 ， 要 救 性 命 。 他 们 说 ， 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 观 看 ， 因 为 我 甚 是 卑 贱 。 [kjv] All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul: see, O LORD, and consider; for I am become vile. [bbe] Breathing out grief all her people are looking for bread; they have given their desired things for food to give them life: see, O Lord, and take note; for she has become a thing of shame. 1:12 [hgb] 你 们 一 切 过 路 的 人 哪 ， 这 事 你 们 不 介 意 吗 ？ 你 们 要 观 看 ， 有 像 这 临 到 我 的 痛 苦 没 有 就 是 耶 和 华 在 他 发 烈 怒 的 日 子 使 我 所 受 的 苦 。 [kjv] Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger. [bbe] Come to me, all you who go by! Keep your eyes on me, and see if there is any pain like the pain of my wound, which the Lord has sent on me in the day of his burning wrath. 1:13 [hgb] 他 从 高 天 使 火 进 入 我 的 骨 头 ， 克 制 了 我 。 他 铺 下 网 罗 ， 绊 我 的 脚 ， 使 我 转 回 。 他 使 我 终 日 凄 凉 发 昏 。 [kjv] From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day. [bbe] From on high he has sent fire into my bones, and it has overcome them: his net is stretched out for my feet, I am turned back by him; he has made me waste and feeble all the day. 1:14 [hgb] 我 罪 过 的 轭 是 他 手 所 绑 的 ， 犹 如 轭 绳 缚 在 我 颈 项 上 。 他 使 我 的 力 量 衰 败 。 主 将 我 交 在 我 所 不 能 敌 挡 的 人 手 中 。 [kjv] The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are wreathed, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the LORD hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up. [bbe] A watch is kept on my sins; they are joined together by his hand, they have come on to my neck; he has made my strength give way: the Lord has given me up into the hands of those against whom I have no power. 1:15 [hgb] 主 轻 弃 我 中 间 的 一 切 勇 士 ， 招 聚 多 人 （ 原 文 作 大 会 ） 攻 击 我 ， 要 压 碎 我 的 少 年 人 。 主 将 犹 大 居 民 踹 下 ， 像 在 酒 榨 中 一 样 。 [kjv] The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the LORD hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress. [bbe] The Lord has made sport of all my men of war in me, he has got men together against me to send destruction on my young men: the virgin daughter of Judah has been crushed like grapes under the feet of the Lord. 1:16 [hgb] 我 因 这 些 事 哭 泣 。 我 眼 泪 汪 汪 。 因 为 那 当 安 慰 我 ， 救 我 性 命 的 ， 离 我 甚 远 。 我 的 儿 女 孤 苦 ， 因 为 仇 敌 得 了 胜 。 [kjv] For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed. [bbe] For these things I am weeping; my eye is streaming with water; because the comforter who might give me new life is far from me: my children are made waste, because the hater is strong. 1:17 [hgb] 锡 安 举 手 ， 无 人 安 慰 。 耶 和 华 论 雅 各 已 经 出 令 ， 使 四 围 的 人 作 他 仇 敌 。 耶 路 撒 冷 在 他 们 中 间 像 不 洁 之 物 。 [kjv] Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them. [bbe] Zion\u0027s hands are outstretched; she has no comforter; the Lord has given orders to the attackers of Jacob round about him: Jerusalem has become like an unclean thing among them. 1:18 [hgb] 耶 和 华 是 公 义 的 。 他 这 样 待 我 ， 是 因 我 违 背 他 的 命 令 。 众 民 哪 ， 请 听 我 的 话 ， 看 我 的 痛 苦 。 我 的 处 女 和 少 年 人 都 被 掳 去 。 [kjv] The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity. [bbe] The Lord is upright; for I have gone against his orders: give ear, now, all you peoples, and see my pain, my virgins and my young men have gone away as prisoners. 1:19 [hgb] 我 招 呼 我 所 亲 爱 的 ， 他 们 却 愚 弄 我 。 我 的 祭 司 和 长 老 正 寻 求 食 物 ， 救 性 命 的 时 候 ， 就 在 城 中 绝 气 。 [kjv] I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and mine elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their meat to relieve their souls. [bbe] I sent for my lovers, but they were false to me: my priests and my responsible men were breathing their last breath in the town, while they were looking for food to give them new life. 1:20 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 观 看 ， 因 为 我 在 急 难 中 。 我 心 肠 扰 乱 。 我 心 在 我 里 面 翻 转 ， 因 我 大 大 悖 逆 。 在 外 ， 刀 剑 使 人 丧 子 。 在 家 ， 犹 如 死 亡 。 [kjv] Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my bowels are troubled; mine heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death. [bbe] See, O Lord, for I am in trouble; the inmost parts of my body are deeply moved; my heart is turned in me; for I have been uncontrolled: outside the children are put to the sword, and in the house there is death. 1:21 [hgb] 听 见 我 叹 息 的 有 人 。 安 慰 我 的 却 无 人 。 我 的 仇 敌 都 听 见 我 所 遭 的 患 难 。 因 你 作 这 事 ， 他 们 都 喜 乐 。 你 必 使 你 报 告 的 日 子 来 到 ， 他 们 就 像 我 一 样 。 [kjv] They have heard that I sigh: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day that thou hast called, and they shall be like unto me. [bbe] Give ear to the voice of my grief; I have no comforter; all my haters have news of my troubles, they are glad because you have done it: let the day of fate come when they will be like me. 1:22 [hgb] 愿 他 们 的 恶 行 都 呈 在 你 面 前 。 你 怎 样 因 我 的 一 切 罪 过 待 我 ， 求 你 照 样 待 他 们 。 因 我 叹 息 甚 多 ， 心 中 发 昏 。 [kjv] Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and my heart is faint. [bbe] Let all their evil-doing come before you; do to them as you have done to me for all my sins: for loud is the sound of my grief, and the strength of my heart is gone.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/131/1964.html","bookId":157,"book":{"id":157,"title":"耶利米哀歌 Lamentations","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 先 前 满 有 人 民 的 城 ， 现 在 何 竟 独 坐 。 先 前 在 列 国 中 为 大 的 ， 现 在 竟 如 寡 妇 。 先 前 在 诸 省 中 为 王 后 的 ， 现 在 成 为 进 贡 的 。 [kjv] How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/131","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
