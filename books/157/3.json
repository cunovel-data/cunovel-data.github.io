he turneth his hand against me all the day. \n [bbe] Truly against me his hand has been turned again and again all the day. \n 3:4 [hgb] 他 使 我 的 皮 肉 枯 干 。 他 折 断 （ 或 作 压 伤 ） 我 的 骨 头 。 \n [kjv] My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones. \n [bbe] My flesh and my skin have been used up by him and my bones broken. \n 3:5 [hgb] 他 筑 垒 攻 击 我 ， 用 苦 楚 （ 原 文 作 苦 胆 ） 和 艰 难 围 困 我 。 \n [kjv] He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail. \n [bbe] He has put up a wall against me, shutting me in with bitter sorrow. \n 3:6 [hgb] 他 使 我 住 在 幽 暗 之 处 ， 像 死 了 许 久 的 人 一 样 。 \n [kjv] He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old. \n [bbe] He has kept me in dark places, like those who have been long dead. \n 3:7 [hgb] 他 用 篱 笆 围 住 我 ， 使 我 不 能 出 去 。 他 使 我 的 铜 链 沉 重 。 \n [kjv] He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy. \n [bbe] He has put a wall round me, so that I am not able to go out; he has made great the weight of my chain. \n 3:8 [hgb] 我 哀 号 求 救 。 他 使 我 的 祷 告 不 得 上 达 。 \n [kjv] Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer. \n [bbe] Even when I send up a cry for help, he keeps my prayer shut out. \n 3:9 [hgb] 他 用 凿 过 的 石 头 挡 住 我 的 道 。 他 使 我 的 路 弯 曲 。 \n [kjv] He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked. \n [bbe] He has put up a wall of cut stones about my ways, he has made my roads twisted. \n 3:10 [hgb] 他 向 我 如 熊 埋 伏 ， 如 狮 子 在 隐 密 处 。 \n [kjv] He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places. \n [bbe] He is like a bear waiting for me, like a lion in secret places. \n 3:11 [hgb] 他 使 我 转 离 正 路 ， 将 我 撕 碎 ， 使 我 凄 凉 。 \n [kjv] He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate. \n [bbe] By him my ways have been turned on one side and I have been pulled in bits; he has made me waste. \n 3:12 [hgb] 他 张 弓 将 我 当 作 箭 靶 子 。 \n [kjv] He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow. \n [bbe] With his bow bent, he has made me the mark for his arrows. \n 3:13 [hgb] 他 把 箭 袋 中 的 箭 射 入 我 的 肺 腑 。 \n [kjv] He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins. \n [bbe] He has let loose his arrows into the inmost parts of my body. \n 3:14 [hgb] 我 成 了 众 民 的 笑 话 。 他 们 终 日 以 我 为 歌 曲 。 \n [kjv] I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day. \n [bbe] I have become the sport of all the peoples; I am their song all the day. \n 3:15 [hgb] 他 用 苦 楚 充 满 我 ， 使 我 饱 用 茵 陈 。 \n [kjv] He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood. \n [bbe] He has made my life nothing but pain, he has given me the bitter root in full measure. \n 3:16 [hgb] 他 又 用 沙 石 碜 断 我 的 牙 ， 用 灰 尘 将 我 蒙 蔽 。 \n [kjv] He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes. \n [bbe] By him my teeth have been broken with crushed stones, and I am bent low in the dust. \n 3:17 [hgb] 你 使 我 远 离 平 安 ， 我 忘 记 好 处 。 \n [kjv] And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity. \n [bbe] My soul is sent far away from peace, I have no more memory of good. \n 3:18 [hgb] 我 就 说 ， 我 的 力 量 衰 败 。 我 在 耶 和 华 那 里 毫 无 指 望 。 \n [kjv] And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD: \n [bbe] And I said, My strength is cut off, and my hope from the Lord. \n 3:19 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 记 念 我 如 茵 陈 和 苦 胆 的 困 苦 窘 迫 。 \n [kjv] Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall. \n [bbe] Keep in mind my trouble and my wandering, the bitter root and the poison. \n 3:20 [hgb] 我 心 想 念 这 些 ， 就 在 里 面 忧 闷 。 \n [kjv] My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me. \n [bbe] My soul still keeps the memory of them; and is bent down in me. \n 3:21 [hgb] 我 想 起 这 事 ， 心 里 就 有 指 望 。 \n [kjv] This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope. \n [bbe] This I keep in mind, and because of this I have hope. \n 3:22 [hgb] 我 们 不 至 消 灭 ， 是 出 于 耶 和 华 诸 般 的 慈 爱 。 是 因 他 的 怜 悯 不 至 断 绝 。 \n [kjv] It is of the LORD\u0027s mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. \n [bbe] It is through the Lord\u0027s love that we have not come to destruction, because his mercies have no limit. \n 3:23 [hgb] 每 早 晨 ， 这 都 是 新 的 。 你 的 诚 实 极 其 广 大 。 \n [kjv] They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness. \n [bbe] They are new every morning; great is your good faith. \n 3:24 [hgb] 我 心 里 说 ， 耶 和 华 是 我 的 分 ， 因 此 ， 我 要 仰 望 他 。 \n [kjv] The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him. \n [bbe] I said to myself, The Lord is my heritage; and because of this I will have hope in him. \n 3:25 [hgb] 凡 等 候 耶 和 华 ， 心 里 寻 求 他 的 ， 耶 和 华 必 施 恩 给 他 。 \n [kjv] The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him. \n [bbe] The Lord is good to those who are waiting for him, to the soul which is looking for him. \n 3:26 [hgb] 人 仰 望 耶 和 华 ， 静 默 等 候 他 的 救 恩 ， 这 原 是 好 的 。 \n [kjv] It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD. \n [bbe] It is good to go on hoping and quietly waiting for the salvation of the Lord. \n 3:27 [hgb] 人 在 幼 年 负 轭 ， 这 原 是 好 的 。 \n [kjv] It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. \n [bbe] It is good for a man to undergo the yoke when he is young. \n 3:28 [hgb] 他 当 独 坐 无 言 ， 因 为 这 是 耶 和 华 加 在 他 身 上 的 。 \n [kjv] He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him. \n [bbe] Let him be seated by himself, saying nothing, because he has put it on him. \n 3:29 [hgb] 他 当 口 贴 尘 埃 ， 或 者 有 指 望 。 \n [kjv] He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope. \n [bbe] Let him put his mouth in the dust, if by chance there may be hope. \n 3:30 [hgb] 他 当 由 人 打 他 的 腮 颊 ， 要 满 受 凌 辱 。 \n [kjv] He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach. \n [bbe] Let his face be turned to him who gives him blows; let him be full of shame. \n 3:31 [hgb] 因 为 主 必 不 永 远 丢 弃 人 。 \n [kjv] For the LORD will not cast off for ever: \n [bbe] For the Lord does not give a man up for ever. \n 3:32 [hgb] 主 虽 使 人 忧 愁 ， 还 要 照 他 诸 般 的 慈 爱 发 怜 悯 。 \n [kjv] But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies. \n [bbe] For though he sends grief, still he will have pity in the full measure of his love. \n 3:33 [hgb] 因 他 并 不 甘 心 使 人 受 苦 ， 使 人 忧 愁 。 \n [kjv] For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men. \n [bbe] For he has no pleasure in troubling and causing grief to the children of men. \n 3:34 [hgb] 人 将 世 上 被 囚 的 踹 （ 原 文 作 压 ） 在 脚 下 ， \n [kjv] To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, \n [bbe] In a man\u0027s crushing under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, \n 3:35 [hgb] 或 在 至 高 者 面 前 屈 枉 人 ， \n [kjv] To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High, \n [bbe] In his turning away the right of a man before the face of the Most High. \n 3:36 [hgb] 或 在 人 的 讼 事 上 颠 倒 是 非 ， 这 都 是 主 看 不 上 的 。 \n [kjv] To subvert a man in his cause, the LORD approveth not. \n [bbe] In his doing wrong to a man in his cause, the Lord has no pleasure. \n 3:37 [hgb] 除 非 主 命 定 ， 谁 能 说 成 就 成 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not? \n [bbe] Who is able to say a thing, and give effect to it, if it has not been ordered by the Lord? \n 3:38 [hgb] 祸 福 不 都 出 于 至 高 者 的 口 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? \n [bbe] Do not evil and good come from the mouth of the Most High? \n 3:39 [hgb] 活 人 因 自 己 的 罪 受 罚 ， 为 何 发 怨 言 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins? \n [bbe] What protest may a living man make, even a man about the punishment of his sin? \n 3:40 [hgb] 我 们 当 深 深 考 察 自 己 的 行 为 ， 再 归 向 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD. \n [bbe] Let us make search and put our ways to the test, turning again to the Lord; \n 3:41 [hgb] 我 们 当 诚 心 向 天 上 的 神 举 手 祷 告 。 \n [kjv] Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens. \n [bbe] Lifting up our hearts with our hands to God in the heavens. \n 3:42 [hgb] 我 们 犯 罪 背 逆 ， 你 并 不 赦 免 。 \n [kjv] We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned. \n [bbe] We have done wrong and gone against your law; we have not had your forgiveness. \n 3:43 [hgb] 你 自 被 怒 气 遮 蔽 ， 追 赶 我 们 。 你 施 行 杀 戮 ， 并 不 顾 惜 。 \n [kjv] Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied. \n [bbe] Covering yourself with wrath you have gone after us, cutting us off without pity; \n 3:44 [hgb] 你 以 黑 云 遮 蔽 自 己 ， 以 致 祷 告 不 得 透 入 。 \n [kjv] Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through. \n [bbe] Covering yourself with a cloud, so that prayer may not get through. \n 3:45 [hgb] 你 使 我 们 在 万 民 中 成 为 污 秽 和 渣 滓 。 \n [kjv] Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people. \n [bbe] You have made us like waste and that for which there is no use, among the peoples. \n 3:46 [hgb] 我 们 的 仇 敌 都 向 我 们 大 大 张 口 。 \n [kjv] All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. \n [bbe] The mouths of all our haters are open wide against us. \n 3:47 [hgb] 恐 惧 和 陷 坑 ， 残 害 和 毁 灭 ， 都 临 近 我 们 。 \n [kjv] Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction. \n [bbe] Fear and deep waters have come on us, wasting and destruction. \n 3:48 [hgb] 因 我 众 民 遭 的 毁 灭 ， 我 就 眼 泪 下 流 如 河 。 \n [kjv] Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people. \n [bbe] Rivers of water are running down from my eyes, for the destruction of the daughter of my people. \n 3:49 [hgb] 我 的 眼 多 多 流 泪 ， 总 不 止 息 ， \n [kjv] Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission, \n [bbe] My eyes are streaming without stopping, they have no rest, \n 3:50 [hgb] 直 等 耶 和 华 垂 顾 ， 从 天 观 看 。 \n [kjv] Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven. \n [bbe] Till the Lord\u0027s eye is turned on me, till he sees my trouble from heaven. \n 3:51 [hgb] 因 我 本 城 的 众 民 ， 我 的 眼 ， 使 我 的 心 伤 痛 。 \n [kjv] Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. \n [bbe] The Lord is unkind to my soul, more than all the daughters of my town. \n 3:52 [hgb] 无 故 与 我 为 仇 的 追 逼 我 ， 像 追 雀 鸟 一 样 。 \n [kjv] Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. \n [bbe] They who are against me without cause have gone hard after me as if I was a bird; \n 3:53 [hgb] 他 们 使 我 的 命 在 牢 狱 中 断 绝 ， 并 将 一 块 石 头 抛 在 我 身 上 。 \n [kjv] They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me. \n [bbe] They have put an end to my life in the prison, stoning me with stones. \n 3:54 [hgb] 众 水 流 过 我 头 ， 我 说 ， 我 命 断 绝 了 。 \n [kjv] Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off. \n [bbe] Waters were flowing over my head; I said, I am cut off. \n 3:55 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 我 从 深 牢 中 求 告 你 的 名 。 \n [kjv] I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon. \n [bbe] I was making prayer to your name, O Lord, out of the lowest prison. \n 3:56 [hgb] 你 曾 听 见 我 的 声 音 。 我 求 你 解 救 ， 你 不 要 掩 耳 不 听 。 \n [kjv] Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry. \n [bbe] My voice came to you; let not your ear be shut to my breathing, to my cry. \n 3:57 [hgb] 我 求 告 你 的 日 子 ， 你 临 近 我 ， 说 ， 不 要 惧 怕 。 \n [kjv] Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not. \n [bbe] You came near in the day when I made my prayer to you: you said, Have no fear. \n 3:58 [hgb] 主 阿 ， 你 伸 明 了 我 的 冤 。 你 救 赎 了 我 的 命 。 \n [kjv] O LORD, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life. \n [bbe] O Lord, you have taken up the cause of my soul, you have made my life safe. \n 3:59 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 见 了 我 受 的 委 屈 。 求 你 为 我 伸 冤 。 \n [kjv] O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause. \n [bbe] O Lord, you have seen my wrong; be judge in my cause. \n 3:60 [hgb] 他 们 仇 恨 我 ， 谋 害 我 ， 你 都 看 见 了 。 \n [kjv] Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me. \n [bbe] You have seen all the evil rewards they have sent on me, and all their designs against me. \n 3:61 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 听 见 他 们 辱 骂 我 的 话 ， 知 道 他 们 向 我 所 设 的 计 ， \n [kjv] Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me; \n [bbe] Their bitter words have come to your ears, O Lord, and all their designs against me; \n 3:62 [hgb] 并 那 些 起 来 攻 击 我 的 人 口 中 所 说 的 话 ， 以 及 终 日 向 我 所 设 的 计 谋 。 \n [kjv] The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day. \n [bbe] The lips of those who came up against me, and their thoughts against me all the day. \n 3:63 [hgb] 求 你 观 看 ， 他 们 坐 下 ， 起 来 ， 都 以 我 为 歌 曲 。 \n [kjv] Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick. \n [bbe] Take note of them when they are seated, and when they get up; I am their song. \n 3:64 [hgb] 耶 和 华 阿 ， 你 要 按 着 他 们 手 所 作 的 向 他 们 施 行 报 应 。 \n [kjv] Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands. \n [bbe] You will give them their reward, O Lord, answering to the work of their hands. \n 3:65 [hgb] 你 要 使 他 们 心 里 刚 硬 ， 使 你 的 咒 诅 临 到 他 们 。 \n [kjv] Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them. \n [bbe] You will let their hearts be covered over with your curse on them. \n 3:66 [hgb] 你 要 发 怒 追 赶 他 们 ， 从 耶 和 华 的 天 下 除 灭 他 们 。 \n [kjv] Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD. \n [bbe] You will go after them in wrath, and put an end to them from under the heavens of the Lord. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/131/1966.html","bookId":157,"book":{"id":157,"title":"耶利米哀歌 Lamentations","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 先 前 满 有 人 民 的 城 ， 现 在 何 竟 独 坐 。 先 前 在 列 国 中 为 大 的 ， 现 在 竟 如 寡 妇 。 先 前 在 诸 省 中 为 王 后 的 ， 现 在 成 为 进 贡 的 。 [kjv] How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/131","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
