{"id":4500,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"4:1 [hgb] 黄 金 何 其 失 光 ； 纯 金 何 其 变 色 。 圣 所 的 石 头 倒 在 各 市 口 上 。 [kjv] How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street. [bbe] How dark has the gold become! how changed the best gold! the stones of the holy place are dropping out at the top of every street. 4:2 [hgb] 锡 安 宝 贵 的 众 子 好 比 精 金 ， 现 在 何 竟 算 为 窑 匠 手 所 作 的 瓦 瓶 。 [kjv] The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter! [bbe] The valued sons of Zion, whose price was the best gold, are looked on as vessels of earth, the work of the hands of the potter! 4:3 [hgb] 野 狗 尚 且 把 奶 乳 哺 其 子 ， 我 民 的 妇 人 倒 成 为 残 忍 ， 好 像 旷 野 的 鸵 鸟 一 般 。 [kjv] Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness. [bbe] Even the beasts of the waste land have full breasts, they give milk to their young ones: the daughter of my people has become cruel like the ostriches in the waste land. 4:4 [hgb] 吃 奶 孩 子 的 舌 头 因 干 渴 贴 住 上 膛 。 孩 童 求 饼 ， 无 人 掰 给 他 们 。 [kjv] The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them. [bbe] The tongue of the child at the breast is fixed to the roof of his mouth for need of drink: the young children are crying out for bread, and no man gives it to them. 4:5 [hgb] 素 来 吃 美 好 食 物 的 ， 现 今 在 街 上 变 为 孤 寒 。 素 来 卧 朱 红 褥 子 的 ， 现 今 躺 卧 粪 堆 。 [kjv] They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills. [bbe] Those who were used to feasting on delicate food are wasted in the streets: those who as children were dressed in purple are stretched out on the dust. 4:6 [hgb] 都 因 我 众 民 的 罪 孽 比 所 多 玛 的 罪 还 大 。 所 多 玛 虽 然 无 人 加 手 于 她 ， 还 是 转 眼 之 间 被 倾 覆 。 [kjv] For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her. [bbe] For the punishment of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of Sodom, which was overturned suddenly without any hand falling on her. 4:7 [hgb] 锡 安 的 贵 胄 素 来 比 雪 纯 净 ， 比 奶 更 白 。 他 们 的 身 体 比 红 宝 玉 （ 或 作 珊 瑚 ） 更 红 ， 像 光 润 的 蓝 宝 石 一 样 。 [kjv] Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire: [bbe] Her holy ones were cleaner than snow, they were whiter than milk, their bodies were redder than corals, their form was as the sapphire: 4:8 [hgb] 现 在 他 们 的 面 貌 比 煤 炭 更 黑 ， 以 致 在 街 上 无 人 认 识 。 他 们 的 皮 肤 紧 贴 骨 头 ， 枯 干 如 同 槁 木 。 [kjv] Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick. [bbe] Their face is blacker than night; in the streets no one has knowledge of them: their skin is hanging on their bones, they are dry, they have become like wood. 4:9 [hgb] 饿 死 的 不 如 被 刀 杀 的 ， 因 为 这 是 缺 了 田 间 的 土 产 ， 就 身 体 衰 弱 ， 渐 渐 消 灭 。 [kjv] They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field. [bbe] Those who have been put to the sword are better off than those whose death is caused by need of food; for these come to death slowly, burned up like the fruit of the field. 4:10 [hgb] 慈 悲 的 妇 人 ， 当 我 众 民 被 毁 灭 的 时 候 ， 亲 手 煮 自 己 的 儿 女 作 为 食 物 。 [kjv] The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. [bbe] The hands of kind-hearted women have been boiling their children; they were their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people. 4:11 [hgb] 耶 和 华 发 怒 成 就 他 所 定 的 ， 倒 出 他 的 烈 怒 。 在 锡 安 使 火 着 起 ， 烧 毁 锡 安 的 根 基 。 [kjv] The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof. [bbe] The Lord has given full effect to his passion, he has let loose his burning wrath; he has made a fire in Zion, causing the destruction of its bases. 4:12 [hgb] 地 上 的 君 王 和 世 上 的 居 民 都 不 信 敌 人 和 仇 敌 能 进 耶 路 撒 冷 的 城 门 。 [kjv] The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem. [bbe] To the kings of the earth and to all the people of the world it did not seem possible that the attackers and the haters would go into the doors of Jerusalem. 4:13 [hgb] 这 都 因 她 先 知 的 罪 恶 和 祭 司 的 罪 孽 。 他 们 在 城 中 流 了 义 人 的 血 。 [kjv] For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her, [bbe] It is because of the sins of her prophets and the evil-doing of her priests, by whom the blood of the upright has been drained out in her. 4:14 [hgb] 他 们 在 街 上 如 瞎 子 乱 走 ， 又 被 血 玷 污 ， 以 致 人 不 能 摸 他 们 的 衣 服 。 [kjv] They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments. [bbe] They are wandering like blind men in the streets, they are made unclean with blood, so that their robes may not be touched by men. 4:15 [hgb] 人 向 他 们 喊 着 说 ， 不 洁 净 的 ， 躲 开 ， 躲 开 。 不 要 挨 近 我 。 他 们 逃 走 飘 流 的 时 候 ， 列 国 中 有 人 说 ， 他 们 不 可 仍 在 这 里 寄 居 。 [kjv] They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there. [bbe] Away! unclean! they were crying out to them, Away! away! let there be no touching: when they went away in flight and wandering, men said among the nations, There is no further resting-place for them. 4:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 发 怒 ， 将 他 们 分 散 ， 不 再 眷 顾 他 们 。 人 不 重 看 祭 司 ， 也 不 厚 待 长 老 。 [kjv] The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders. [bbe] The face of the Lord has sent them in all directions; he will no longer take care of them: they had no respect for the priests, they gave no honour to the old men. 4:17 [hgb] 我 们 仰 望 人 来 帮 助 ， 以 致 眼 目 失 明 ， 还 是 枉 然 。 我 们 所 盼 望 的 ， 竟 盼 望 一 个 不 能 救 人 的 国 。 [kjv] As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us. [bbe] Our eyes are still wasting away in looking for our false help: we have been watching for a nation unable to give salvation. 4:18 [hgb] 仇 敌 追 赶 我 们 的 脚 步 像 打 猎 的 ， 以 致 我 们 不 敢 在 自 己 的 街 上 行 走 。 我 们 的 结 局 临 近 。 我 们 的 日 子 满 足 。 我 们 的 结 局 来 到 了 。 [kjv] They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come. [bbe] They go after our steps so that we may not go in our streets: our end is near, our days are numbered; for our end has come. 4:19 [hgb] 追 赶 我 们 的 比 空 中 的 鹰 更 快 。 他 们 在 山 上 追 逼 我 们 ， 在 旷 野 埋 伏 ， 等 候 我 们 。 [kjv] Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness. [bbe] Those who went after us were quicker than the eagles of the heaven, driving us before them on the mountains, waiting secretly for us in the waste land. 4:20 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 受 膏 者 好 比 我 们 鼻 中 的 气 ， 在 他 们 的 坑 中 被 捉 住 。 我 们 曾 论 到 他 说 ， 我 们 必 在 他 荫 下 ， 在 列 国 中 存 活 。 [kjv] The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen. [bbe] Our breath of life, he on whom the holy oil was put, was taken in their holes; of whom we said, Under his shade we will be living among the nations. 4:21 [hgb] 住 乌 斯 地 的 以 东 民 哪 ， 只 管 欢 喜 快 乐 。 苦 杯 也 必 传 到 你 那 里 。 你 必 喝 醉 ， 以 致 露 体 。 [kjv] Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked. [bbe] Have joy and be glad, O daughter of Edom, living in the land of Uz: the cup will be given to you in your turn, and you will be overcome with wine and your shame will be seen. 4:22 [hgb] 锡 安 的 民 哪 ， 你 罪 孽 的 刑 罚 受 足 了 ， 耶 和 华 必 不 使 你 再 被 掳 去 。 以 东 的 民 哪 ， 他 必 追 讨 你 的 罪 孽 ， 显 露 你 的 罪 恶 。 [kjv] The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins. [bbe] The punishment of your evil-doing is complete, O daughter of Zion; never again will he take you away as a prisoner: he will give you the reward of your evil-doing, O daughter of Edom; he will let your sin be uncovered.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/131/1967.html","bookId":157,"book":{"id":157,"title":"耶利米哀歌 Lamentations","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 先 前 满 有 人 民 的 城 ， 现 在 何 竟 独 坐 。 先 前 在 列 国 中 为 大 的 ， 现 在 竟 如 寡 妇 。 先 前 在 诸 省 中 为 王 后 的 ， 现 在 成 为 进 贡 的 。 [kjv] How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/131","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:20 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:40 AM"}}
