Never doubted that. And won\u0027t start now, either.\"\\n\\n We remain staring into each other\u0027s eyes for a long time, so close, and not just in a physical sense. I know that she is waiting for me to say something, but it\u0027s hard enough to think as it is. When I finally break the silence, the only thing that leaves my lips is, \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n Bella is silent for a moment, then lets one of her hands slide down to stroke my cheek softly.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t know what?\"\\n\\n \"What I want to do now. If I still feel anything for him. If I even want to.\"\\n\\n She blinks for a moment, taking in my words, and I can tell that they surprise her a little.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know or you don\u0027t want to know?\"\\n\\n The doubt in her voice makes me laugh, but it\u0027s a dry, pained sound.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not just another idiot in a long line who\u0027s been living in denial. I really can\u0027t say. It would be so much easier if it were just that, then I could just stop trying not to\\n\\n whatever it is I do. Like him, need him, want him.\"\\n\\n A light frown appears between her brows, and for a moment I get lost in studying the elegant curve of her mouth.\\n\\n \"But there was a time that wasn\u0027t so?\"\\n\\n My pained inhale is all the answer she needs, but true to her previous words, she doesn\u0027t seem horrified or even put off.\\n\\n \"But you got over him?\" she presumes.\\n\\n \"Kind of.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not a no.\"\\n\\n \"But also not a yes.\"\\n\\n We keep looking at each other then, and after a while it all just gets too heavy for me.\\n\\n \"Do you mind if I just hold you?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not,\" she whispers, then brushes another kiss over my lips before she turns around, ready to be tugged into my embrace. I mold my body against hers, with her head pillowed on one of my arms, while I snake the other over her abdomen. We stay like that for a while, our fingers entwined over her stomach, both of us lost in thought.\\n\\n I have no idea how much time has passed – it feels like hours, but has probably only been minutes – when I hear her clear her throat.\\n\\n \"You know, I really miss what we had. And I\u0027m not even talking about the mind-blowing sex. Just\\n\\n us. Like after that first threesome, when we were\\n\\n all lying in a heap of limbs on the couch with two boxes of pizza and a movie playing, and life was just so uncomplicated. I want that back.\"\\n\\n Her words make me yearn for just that, but I know that we can never go back to that. Too much has happened. When I tell her that, she\u0027s silent for a moment.\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Why what?\"\\n\\n \"Why can\u0027t we go back to that?\"\\n\\n \"Uhm, because of the whole shit that went down?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s maybe a reason to make it harder to get there again, but it didn\u0027t just turn our lives into a one-way road.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m stunned for a moment, and Bella uses that to turn over slightly until she can look back at my face.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re living in a relationship where expressing our love for each other comes with things like you letting a scary woman cane the soles of my feet.\\n\\n We already make the rules for our world – there\u0027s nothing impossible there if we just want to make it happen. Stress on if we want.\"\\n\\n \"I feel like we\u0027re going in circles.\"\\n\\n \"Not really,\" she snorts, then get serious again. \"The real question right now isn\u0027t what was, or what is, but what we want it to be. Do you want Jazz to be with us again? I\u0027m not talking about you falling head over heels madly in love with him. No solution that will work as it is until the end of our days.\\n\\n But right now, do you still want him? Or do you want him to be gone from our bed and house forever?\"\\n\\n I mull that over in my head for a while.\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"No as in you don\u0027t want him anymore?\"\\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t want him gone.\"\\n\\n We keep looking deeply into each other\u0027s eyes for several moments longer, before I slowly extricate myself from her, then draw her to her feet with me.\\n\\n Never losing eye contact I kiss her one last time before I take her hand in mine and gently tug her towards the door.\\n\\n \"Come on, I think we already lost enough time in the last six months.\"\\n\\n Chapter 26\\n\\n My resolve falters when I reach the top of the stairs leading down into the living room. It\u0027s only a moment, barely long enough for Bella to walk by me so she ends up being the one to tug me after her and not the other way round, but in those seconds panic grips me hard. Suddenly I don\u0027t know what to do because everything seems like the perfect recipe for disaster, and I just want to go back and hide in the bedroom untill-\\n\\n But this is where my thoughts grind to a halt and I\u0027m able to calm myself again. I\u0027ve been hiding and waiting for months, and a quick glance at the set of Bella\u0027s jaw tells me that she thinks now is the best time to stop doing that and move on.\\n\\n Moments later we reach the room below and Bella lets go of my hand, but only after caressing my forearm lovingly.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go make some more coffee,\" she murmurs softly, then leaves me standing there on my own.\\n\\n Looking over from her to where Jazz is sitting on the couch, I have to fight a new wave of apprehension, but one of a wholly different kind than before.\\n\\n The way his shoulders tense I can tell that he\u0027s aware of our presence, but he doesn\u0027t yet look up from where he\u0027s slumped, his face buried in his hands. I try to remember if I\u0027ve ever seen him that down, but come up blank. Not even after Alice has kicked him out has he seemed so lost.\\n\\n I hate seeing him like that, even more so because I\u0027m part of the problem.\\n\\n And with that realization comes another – I\u0027m so sick of feeling like shit all the time, with everything being plagued with issues and every situation about as awkward as it can get.\\n\\n Using my newfound resolve to change that, I sit down on the sofa on the far side from Jazz. He doesn\u0027t move for a while, but then I hear him sigh softly as if he\u0027s gathering his strength. When he finally straightens and looks at me he\u0027s still weary, but I can see in his eyes that he\u0027s trying to steel himself for what\u0027s to come. Guess I can\u0027t hold that against him.\\n\\n \"If you want me to go, just say so, I\u0027ll spare you the bother of having to kick me out.\"\\n\\n \"No one\u0027s going to kick you out,\" I reply, surprised at how steady my voice sounds when inside I\u0027m still feeling like I\u0027m totally blindsided.\\n\\n Jazz looks surprised for a moment, then accepts my words with a nod, and we both keep staring at each other until Bella joins us with the coffee.\\n\\n \"Gee, tone it down a notch, both of you, you\u0027re making my skin crawl with all that heavy, meaningful silence,\" she jokes, then sits down. Just not between us where there\u0027s the most space on the sofa, but on my left, squeezing herself between me and the armrest at the end of the seat. To make room for her I have to move towards Jazz, and I pointedly glance at her less than subtle hint, which she of course ignores.\\n\\n The silence continues to stretch in all its awkwardness while we\u0027re busy caffeinating ourselves. And it just keeps getting worse by the minute, until finally I\u0027ve reached a point where I just can\u0027t let it drag on anymore.\\n\\n Straightening, I lean back, not quite incidentally snaking my arm around Bella to keep close to her. She smiles a little at that but doesn\u0027t comment, nor does she lean into me, either.\\n\\n Turning back to where Jazz is studying us, I try to come up with something worthwhile to say, but as my mind is still sluggish, I decide to stick with being blunt. So far that has served us all well today.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so sick of all this shit.\" Jazz frowns at my words but holds his tongue, and with a loud exhale I force myself to go on. \"I\u0027m sick of feeling like a dumb fuck, and I\u0027m sick of everything being so difficult and awkward. We\u0027ve all made mistakes, and we\u0027ll have to deal with this mess eventually, but something has to change, now.\"\\n\\n I can feel Bella\u0027s silent approval from my side, but Jazz still looks doubtful.\\n\\n No wonder, considering that both he and Bella did a lot of talking, in the bathroom and afterwards respectively, while I\u0027ve mostly kept my thoughts to myself.\\n\\n Looking down at my hands for a moment, I force myself to take the next step.\\n\\n \"I had thought that I was done with you, but listening to you and Bella today has made me realize that I still want you. Not in a mushy, \u0027oh I\u0027ve been so heartbroken over losing you\u0027 kind of way, but simple, primal need. I want to fuck you, no more, no less.\"\\n\\n A hint of a grin starts showing on Jasper\u0027s face, but I go on before he can get his hopes up.\\n\\n \"But that doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m over what you did, or that either of us has forgiven you. It just means that we\u0027re willing to give you a chance.\" I deliberately stress that I\u0027m talking for both Bella and myself, and when I stop there she picks up the thread effortlessly after squeezing my thigh.\\n\\n \"And by chance we mean one chance. Don\u0027t fuck up or I will personally kick you out for good.\"\\n\\n The underlying rage in her voice is scary, and it has a satisfyingly sobering effect on Jazz.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t mess up, I promise,\" Jazz tries to interject, but Bella isn\u0027t done yet, and a look from her is enough to make him shut up at once.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll see about that. I just need you to fully understand what I mean.\\n\\n Edward and I have moved forward a lot since our last threesome, both as a couple and in the playroom. As much as I\u0027m happy to have you back with us, I won\u0027t let you come between us. I\u0027m sure Edward will enjoy teaching you a thing or two if you want that and letting you be his sidekick, but I could never see you as my Dom. I also don\u0027t need you to be my knight in shining armor, because this damsel here really loves being in distress. If something freaks you out I expect you to just go and leave us to what we want to do, and later we can talk about it. But you can\u0027t intervene on my behalf, so to say, because I really don\u0027t want you to, and the last thing I need is Edward second-guessing himself just because what I need him to do makes you uncomfortable. Get that?\"\\n\\n \"Loud and clear. And don\u0027t worry, I won\u0027t even try.\"\\n\\n Her snort is derisive, but she leaves it at that, obviously happy to have that conversation for another time. Jazz looks sincere enough that I don\u0027t think this matter needs any more stressing, but I\u0027m relieved that Bella has been the one to tackle it - however he might really be feeling about it, hearing it from her will leave more of an impression than if I had said it.\\n\\n \"Good, now that that\u0027s settled I guess we can move on, right?\"\\n\\n They both look a little surprised at my forced happy tone, but I don\u0027t dwell on that.\\n\\n \"Of course we can spend weeks now, or even months, to slowly re-establish our friendship and take baby steps to see just where this will lead to, but somehow I get the impression that none of us would really be happy with that. Let\u0027s face it, you want to fuck me, I want to fuck you, and Bella\u0027s a step away from happy feet at the thought of being the filling in that sandwich, so why wait?\"\\n\\n Jazz nearly chokes on his last sip of coffee at my words, then turns a partly lopsided grin at me.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t really believe in beating around the bush anymore, I take it.\"\\n\\n \"Nope. Every time I tried to be subtle about something instead of stating blunt facts it ended in a mess. I\u0027m done with that. Got any problems with that?\"\\n\\n \"None, whatsoever.\"\\n\\n \"Great, are we done with this yet? Because I really need to get laid, now that the number of available cocks has doubled for me.\"\\n\\n Jazz looks from Bella to me, then back to her and chuckles.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t do subtle anymore, either, I see?\"\\n\\n She laughs, then gets up in one lithe motion as she shakes her head.\\n\\n \"Subtlety is so overrated, if you ask me.\"\\n\\n Leaning down she plants a single, gentle kiss onto my lips, murmuring a soft, \"Don\u0027t be a stranger,\" before she walks over to Jazz. The fact that she has to squeeze herself between the coffee table and me doesn\u0027t hamper the near predatory grace of her movements, her eyes never leaving Jasper\u0027s, not even when she straddles him and crosses her arms loosely behind his neck. Although her tits are right in front of him he keeps gazing into her face, as if he\u0027s still searching for something there.\\n\\n I half expect her to play coy and bite her lip, or add another remark that will dampen the intensity and turn it into something more comfortable, but she doesn\u0027t. Instead she makes him tilt his face up more by bringing her own close to his, then kisses him, slowly but passionately. He hesitates for a moment, then joins in, his hands kneading her hips just where her tank top has ridden up, revealing a sliver of warm, smooth flesh.\\n\\n I also expect some of the residual jealousy that has been riding shotgun throughout our last threesome to rear its ugly head, but watching them just makes me unbearably horny.\\n\\n Bella breaks off the kiss by leaning back enough to grin at Jazz, her fingers idly playing with his hair.\\n\\n \"Does that feel weird to you?\"\\n\\n He shrugs, still focused on her, the motion letting him push up her top a couple of inches more.\\n\\n \"A little, as usual.\"\\n\\n Not the reply she\u0027s been waiting for, but she laughs it off easily enough.\\n\\n \"But is that a problem for you?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d say that\u0027s part of the appeal,\" he answers, then shifts his grip so that his hands steady her back as he leans forward in turn, licking along her clavicle and up the side of her throat. Bella laughs breathily as she turns her head to give him better access, the motion also making her look over at me. The lust darkening her eyes makes my cock respond instinctively, but she still seems to feel the need to encourage me.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you come a little closer? It\u0027s creepy when you just sit there and stare at us.\"\\n\\n She even adds a pout, as if I don\u0027t know that she\u0027s teasing me, but instead of following her lead I remain where I am.\\n\\n \"Maybe because you two are so hot together that I just want to watch you for a while?\"\\n\\n My reply makes her laugh, the sound turning into a squeak when Jazz grabs her ass and pulls her closer, burying his face in her still covered tits.\\n\\n He joins in her laughter then until she attacks his neck, causing him to squeeze her ass harder while she grinds her hips against his. His head lolls to the side then and now it\u0027s him looking over at me, once he opens his eyes again. The intensity in his gaze draws me in, and I already feel myself getting up when he agrees with Bella\u0027s previous assessment, offering a snorted, \"Yeah, creepy.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t really know what exactly I should do then, so I just sit down closer to them, and again Bella takes the lead. Sliding down from Jazz\u0027s lap and turning around, she ends up wedged between us, and while he\u0027s busy kissing her neck again, she turns her face to me. Never one to pass up such an invitation I press my lips against hers, my tongue deep in her mouth until I make her moan against me. Sliding my hand up her side I grab her right tit and squeeze it, then let my fingers find her nipple to rub it gently. She arches her torso into my grasp and moans again, this time clearly encouragingly, so I do the same with her other breast.\\n\\n Bella\u0027s hand soon finds her way into my sweat pants, eagerly grabbing my already hardening cock, but then she turns her head away, breaking our kiss, to glare at Jazz.\\n\\n \"Your jeans are a problem. Off!\"\\n\\n He grins at her but doesn\u0027t make a move to obey her command, although the bulge in his pants shows that he\u0027s obviously not opposed to her hand rubbing over the denim as it is. Instead he reaches up and grabs her head to kiss her roughly, causing an indignant squeal from her that doesn\u0027t really sound like protest. I use the opportunity to bite down on the exposed side of her neck, adding to her distress. I\u0027ve nearly forgotten just how much fun teasing her like that has always been, and the way she keeps stroking my cock she doesn\u0027t seem to mind herself.\\n\\n When he lets go of her hair again Jazz accidentally brushes against my right arm, and for a moment my skin where he has touched me seems to tingle. I can\u0027t even rationally explain why, with most of Bella\u0027s body mashed against mine that little bit of additional contact shouldn\u0027t matter, but it does, and judging from the cautious look on his face I\u0027m not the only one feeling it. I wonder if I should touch him in turn, but it seems as if I\u0027m not yet quite there yet. Bella doesn\u0027t miss us both freezing for a few seconds, but her incessant squirming against us quickly diverts our attention back to her.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know about you, but I\u0027m wearing too much. Anyone in a mind to change that?\"\\n\\n Jazz hesitates a little so I take up the challenge and draw her closer to me so that her back is pressed against my chest. I mash my lips against hers hungrily, then slide my hands underneath her already hitched up tank top.\\n\\n She\u0027s only wearing that and her yoga pants so I take my time, instead of undressing her I resume teasing her nipples. They are obviously still more sensitive from getting pierced not long ago, but as far as I can tell that\u0027s more of an advantage than a hindrance.\\n\\n Jazz shifts so that he\u0027s crouching on the sofa now, then moves closer so that he can run his fingers over the exposed skin at her hips and slide them into her waistband. When he incidentally touches my thigh this time it doesn\u0027t make me pause again, nor when he not so incidentally strokes my left forearm before he pulls her tank top off over her head.\\n\\n I shift my grip on her tits then so that I\u0027m cupping them from underneath as I push them up and together, in a way offering them to him. Of course he looks at them – what guy wouldn\u0027t? - and it\u0027s funny to watch his eyes widen as he becomes aware of the recent changes neither of us has yet felt the need to inform him of. Leaning further back against me Bella chuckles, then strokes her nipples invitingly.\\n\\n \"You like?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, me like a lot,\" Jazz replies, his eyes still glued to her breasts. Then they snap up to my face, a hint of a frown on his. \"Your idea?\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t know if I should be offended or amused at the assumption, but decide to let it go.\\n\\n \"Nope, all her idea.\"\\n\\n \"All?\"\\n\\n \"All,\" I confirm with a smirk, then continue to ravage Bella\u0027s mouth while my fingers keep digging into her tits. Jazz eventually overcomes his shock and picks up where he has left off before by dragging Bella\u0027s pants down her legs. Tease that she is she keeps her knees together so that he doesn\u0027t get a better idea of what said \u0027all\u0027 entails, but once she\u0027s naked herself she starts working on the fly of his jeans, unhindered by my hands still kneading her breasts.\\n\\n It takes a little shuffling and tugging to get Jazz out of his jeans, and I can tell from the way Bella keeps fumbling that she wants me to help. I\u0027m more reluctant to let go of her tits than touch him, which makes me pause once again, but I\u0027m not one to dwell on things like that for long. We end up kneeling on the couch with Bella perching on the edge of the coffee table, and I can\u0027t really bring myself to look away when Jazz catches my gaze.\\n\\n Following a spur of the moment impulse I grab his head and kiss him, telling myself that I should quit stalling after my dramatic speech from before. The taste, scent, feel of him invading my senses is still so familiar, yet oddly strange at the same time. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beautiful-disaster-beautiful-1/page-42.html","bookId":2786,"book":{"id":2786,"title":"Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful #1)","description":"Storyline: Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful #1) \\n INTENSE.
