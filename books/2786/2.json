{"id":88841,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"“Are you a good girl, Bella?” She shudders as she hears the growl in my voice, a silent warning that I expect her to behave. “Yes, Sir!” “You know that you have to ask permission before you come?” Once more she shudders, but probably more due to my finger dipping into her and drawing lazy circles just inside her pussy, driving her wild. “I know,” she groans out, the cutest of lines appearing on her forehead as she tries to hold back. “Do you think you can come when I pour the wax over your tits and cunt? Come for me?” I whisper into her ear, letting her hear how much the idea of that turns me on. Bella\u0027s answer is a loud moan, and I watch with amusement as her breathing picks up further. “Yes, Sir!” Chapter 2 I attack her neck again for a few moments, then prop my chin up on her shoulder the better to see what I\u0027m doing. Her panting is the sweetest music to me as I scare her a little, pretending to dip the candle but pulling back before any wax can spill over. I know that under different circumstances she would call me out on that shit, but she\u0027s too far gone now, and anything I do is just adding to her arousal. Then I decide that she has suffered enough, and let the wax splash into her body – two well-aimed gushes onto her nipples, the rest onto her lower belly onto the crotch rope so that it spills left and right down over her pubic mount and labia. At the same time I thrust two fingers into her, fast and as deep as I can reach. Bella arches her back and shouts, a hoarse cry full of pleasure, laced with just a little pain to make it interesting. I feel her whole body shudder as she comes from the onslaught of sensation, beautiful in her abandon. I set the candle down and thread my fingers through her hair, turning her head to me so that I can stifle her whimpers with my lips and tongue, while I keep fucking her slowly to draw out her orgasm. After a while she stops clenching around my fingers and I slowly withdraw them, but keep kissing her while I wrap my arms around her for a while, letting her come back down to earth. Sadly, my cock has other ideas when Bella\u0027s bound hands brush against my crotch accidentally. And so does she, as her fingers are back in an instant, stroking me idly through the soft leather. I grin against her mouth before I turn my head away and let go of her as I stand up in one smooth motion. Bella remains kneeling, gazing up at me through her thick lashes. I quickly try to come up with a plan for what to do, and curse myself for not having a backup idea at hand. But she really surprised me with her eagerness to try the wax play. The obvious answer is often the easiest one, and after a moment\u0027s hesitation I go for it. A light smile plays around Bella\u0027s lips as she watches me undo my pants and get my dick out. I\u0027m so hard already that I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll come way too soon, but then she usually has that effect on me in the playroom. She obediently opens her mouth when I step up to her, and I sneer a “Suck my cock, bitch!” down at her, which is really unnecessary as she is already closing her lips around it. I can\u0027t stifle a groan when she starts sucking in earnest, her tongue pressed flat against the underside of my dick. I normally love to let her do the work, but tonight I\u0027m honestly too horny myself, so I grab her hair and start to fuck her mouth in short hard strokes. I have to pull out when she starts humming, and as I glare down at her I see her smirking up at me. It\u0027s frustrating to know that she can read me so well now, but then she spends ample time sucking me off. “Care to tell me what\u0027s so funny, slut?” Not even that can wipe the grin off her face, so I don\u0027t wait for her answer, but instead reach down and push her onto the floor so that she\u0027s lying on her side, helpless as she can\u0027t even balance herself due to the bonds. While she is distracted I kneel down and pull on her bonds until the heel of her lower leg is touching her ass and her upper knee is at her chest, leaving her completely open for me. The sensation of her pussy clamping down on my cock as I thrust into her is heavenly, and I groan as I sheath myself fully inside of her. Bella gasps at the intrusion, the whole motion forcing the crotch rope to press even harder into her. I also feel it chafing against the sides of my cock, a sensation I’m glad of as it allows me to hold back a little longer. I try to hold back but I simply can\u0027t, seeing her writhe under me just makes me want to come let go. I grab the ropes keeping her restrained for leverage as I start fucking her, hard enough to push and pull her along the floor. Bella pants and thrashes under me, her eyes half closed. They go wide as I shift my weight and lean over her, my weight on my fists next to her head. I stare deep into those wonderful pools of lust as I increase my speed, pumping into her without holding back anymore. Her high moans and cries urge me on further, and I\u0027m in heaven. I\u0027m lost in her eyes as I finally come deep inside of her. Strength leaves me and I roll off her before I can sag onto her, which I try to avoid at all costs as she\u0027s halfway lying on her strained and bound arms already. I\u0027m lucky not to have knocked over one of the candles, and hastily blow it out before anything else can happen. Bella is still panting hard next to me as I catch my breath, a look of conflict on her face as she nibbles on her lip. Smirking, I gather her close so that she\u0027s half lying on me, her back and arms pressed against my chest and side. She can’t see my face as I softly kiss her neck, making her shiver while her groan sounds treacherously frustrated. “Do you want to come again?” I ask her, teasing her with my tongue licking over the shell of her ear. “Please!” she pants in answer, her need clear in her voice. “Oh I don\u0027t know if I should let you come. You\u0027re such a greedy girl sometimes.” She\u0027s silent for a moment, either gathering her wits or cursing me in her thoughts. Probably both. I don\u0027t really care, as long as her response remains the same. Seconds tick by, until I hear her sigh nearly inaudibly. “Please, Master, make me come again?” I’m still not done teasing her, but can\u0027t resist reaching for her breast and idly picking at the wax on the now slightly cooler flesh. Bella hisses, telling me that I’ve kept the bonds on her long enough to oversensitize the bound areas, mainly her tits. “Only if you beg me nicely.” Again she sighs, and I smirk as I slap her breast, hard. Her breath catches in her throat, and this time it is real pain that mars her face for a second. She should know better than to sigh in exasperation where I can hear it. “Sir, please, may I come again? I\u0027m so wound up and horny from the light burn of the wax, and from you fucking me, please, make me come? Please?” I smile down at her as I rearrange her body again until I\u0027m more or less sitting with her lying in my arms. Reaching down so I can rub her clit through the crotch rope, I idly pinch her nipple with the other. Bella arches her back, looking nearly content for a moment as I resume masturbating her – until I slap her breast again, not quite as hard, but hard enough to hurt. She cranes her head so she can look up into my face, and I smirk at her as I hit her bound tit again. Her groan speaks of her discomfort, but I can tell that her body is responding already. By now most of the wax has peeled off her tortured tit, so I switch sides, slapping the other one until the wax is gone from there, too. “Please -” she whispers, making me stop and look into her face again. I raise my brows, telling her silently to go on. Her eyes are wide once more, urging me on. “Please don\u0027t stop. Please don\u0027t stop!” I grin, but of course don\u0027t follow her begging. Instead I push her forward into a sitting position so that I can undo the bonds around her arms, also those keeping her wrists connected. She looks at me with surprise when I pull her back against me, grabbing her breasts in both hands while my fingers worry her nipples. “I want you to make yourself come, my little minx. Rub yourself until you come.” A smile tugs at the corners of her mouth as she nods and reaches between her legs, her other hand idle on her bound thigh. “Thank you -” she starts to say, but my tongue plunging into her mouth makes it impossible for her to finish the sentence. She relaxes into me, but only for a second, until I start running my short nails all over her tits. Small whimpers escape between our lips, and before long I feel her shudder all over as her climax is approaching. She\u0027s trying to ask for permission to come, but I simply won\u0027t let her. I\u0027m wondering how long she will hold out – or will she just come without permission? But my girl knows better than that, her needy mewls get louder and louder, but she\u0027s all tensed up with the effort to stop herself from coming. A minute passes, two, in which I just revel in the sense of power I have over her. It\u0027s really just a small thing, but the fact alone that she’s fighting her need to orgasm just because I won\u0027t tell her that she can is giving me a kick that goes beyond the physical sensation of coming deep inside of her. She\u0027s doing this for me, and me alone. I take pity on her then and withdraw long enough to pant, “Come for me!” before my lips crash down on hers again, devouring her. At the same time, I grab her breasts hard and squeeze them until I feel her body going slack in the throes of passion. While she is still shaking with the aftermath of her release I stroke her tits softly, and watch the light cast by the candles flicker over her reddened flesh. She nuzzles into the crook of my neck, her breath still fast and hot on my skin, and we stay like that for a while. I smile down at her beautiful body before I start untying her, working slowly to give her limbs time to resume a more comfortable position. Bella only moans when the blood comes rushing back into her breasts, the rope marks vivid against her skin even when the previously bound flesh has resumed its normal color again. She smiles tiredly when I gather her even closer to me, and with my free hand I reach to douse the rest of the candles. For a moment we\u0027re in the dark before my eyes adjust, the moonlight streaming in through the skylights. I\u0027m still not used to my playroom having a flat ceiling, but at least that element has remained the same. Bella sighs contently as I get up with her in my arms and carry her across the hall into our bathroom where I set her onto her own feet again in the shower. We remain in the near darkness, just bathed in silver moon light, as we shower, kissing and touching each other lovingly while we take care of the residues of our evening entertainment. A while later we lie snuggled against one another in our huge bed, Bella idly playing with the soft spattering of hair of what she calls my \u0027happy trail\u0027. I\u0027m exhausted and about to drift off, but she has other intentions. “You know, the wax was a lot less painful than I thought.” I don\u0027t even crack my eyes open, just answer her with a mumble that hopefully conveys just how tired I am. “Told you so.” “I know,” she sighs emphatically, sounding unnervingly awake. “I just thought it would be worse, you know? On my pussy at least.” Her fingers skim up my body until she circles my nipple playfully, evidently still not ready to call it a night. Bella touching me playfully usually means she wants more. I try to evade that terrible fate of having to make love to my beautiful fiancée by turning onto my side and drawing her along until I\u0027m spooning her with my body. She just sees that as an invitation and starts rubbing her ass against my crotch, and of course my traitorous cock never sleeps. I groan and try to pull my hips away from her, but she turns in my arms, and seconds later I find myself on my back, Bella straddling me. “Do you really think you can get me that worked up and leave it at that three minutes of an excuse for fucking?” she taunts me as she grabs my cock and slides it between her pussy lips, teasing her clit before she pushes herself down on me. We both groan in unison, and I see that my quest for sleep is really to be abandoned. “Excuse for fucking, huh?” Her grin broadens. “Come on, three minutes, what do you call that? I don\u0027t care if you\u0027re tired, if you don\u0027t satisfy my needs in the playroom, you better do it here!” God, I love it when she\u0027s all demanding, like now when she\u0027s smirking down at me and starting to roll her hips slowly against mine. My hands run over her thighs up to her waist, but she\u0027ll have none of that, grabbing my wrists and pushing them into the pillow next to my head as she leans over my body. I grin up at her, not even trying to shake her off, and instead crane my neck so that I can suck her nipple into my mouth. Bella laughs throatily, then moans as she feels my teeth worrying her nipple slightly. “I love it when you do that,” she tells me, but when I try to extricate my hands from hers, she just squeezes my wrists harder. “No, no, you had your fun tormenting my poor boobs! I\u0027m still all tender, so you better be nice to them!” I suck a little harder until she moans again before I let go and show her other nipple the same attention. Her sweet moans urge me on, and before long I\u0027m pushing my hips up to meet hers, but letting her pick the pace. My lips then travel on as I kiss and lick every part of her chest that I can reach. Bella shifts her body anew and I grunt when I can no longer nuzzle into the promised land of her tits, but then her lips find mine, and I don\u0027t care anymore. She lowers herself onto my chest until I\u0027m carrying her whole weight, her tits pressed against me now. Her hands let go of my wrists and her fingers run through my hair, idly playing with my locks before she tugs on them hard. I groan in mock protest, before I reach down and slap her ass playfully. Bella grunts and deepens the kiss, making me forget what I wanted to do. My hands remain on her ass, pushing her against my thrusts, all tiredness swept away. Then she goes rigid and throws her head back, letting me see the beatific look on her face as she climaxes, again. I let go, a few more thrusts into her and I come deep inside of her. Bella sags back down onto me and I hug her close as I kiss her jaw softly. “Better now?” I finally break the silence. She chuckles. “Somewhat.” “Somewhat? Do I really have to get up and bend you over the living room couch and fuck you into oblivion?” “Okay, you win, I\u0027m satisfied. For now.” I laugh as I hug her closer, then turn around to spoon her once again. Maybe I’ll get lucky and she\u0027ll leave me be now. I\u0027m without a doubt the happiest man alive. Chapter 3 Waking up with Bella next to me, still asleep with her mouth slightly open – my new favorite sight. Or not quite so new, considering that since we hooked up she\u0027s been sleeping in my bed whenever there was a chance that I would use it during the night at some point, but I think it will never lose its novelty. I can spend hours gazing at her, although I don\u0027t tell her, because she’ll think it\u0027s creepy. I don\u0027t intend to stop doing it any time soon though. The shrilling of her alarm clock breaks my Bella watching meditation, and I spend the next ten minutes kissing and groping her. At first she is still grumpy because she has to get up, then she protests, but it doesn\u0027t take much to persuade her to give in to me. Too bad that I don\u0027t realize that she really means it when she tells me that she has to leave in fifteen minutes once she finally escapes my grasp and runs into the bathroom, so I find myself sitting alone in the kitchen for breakfast. I decide to cut my losses and take my bowl of cereal outside onto the terrace, and on second thought fetch the OJ carton, too. It\u0027s only half the fun drinking it when Bella can\u0027t catch me, but at least I can claim consistency with my rebellious action. I love our new condo. Close to the bay, in walking distance from Bella\u0027s job, only ten minutes commute to the hospital. The lower floor is pretty much one huge room, with picture windows that open onto the terrace on one side. If we decide to have kids, we\u0027ll have to move again, but for the moment it\u0027s perfect. Bella wanted to move, and I didn\u0027t protest for a second. Best decision ever. There are just too many memories I want to forget in the old house, and I\u0027m sure she\u0027s not doing better in that aspect. Esme found it for us, and for once in my life I\u0027m happy my mom meddled. She never admits it, but I\u0027m pretty sure that she\u0027s been looking for something ever since she heard of my word vomit proposal. The tour with the realtor she dragged me along on I will probably never forget. Her astute, “My son likes to bang on things so we need something with good sound proofing” made me keel over laughing. Not that I really care what the realtor thinks. The previous owner was drummer in a band, and I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll never exceed those noise levels. Unless I spank Bella outside on the terrace, which I think I\u0027m going to do next weekend. I know how much she likes to whimper, moan, and cry out when I bend her over my knee, should be interesting to see what she\u0027ll do when she has to stay silent. Of course now my cock is unbearably hard, but I keep myself from wanking out here. Even I have limits of what I\u0027ll do, and without Bella indecent behavior is only half the fun. When I\u0027m done munching my Frosted Flakes, I take the used dish inside and leave it in the dish washer before I dress and leave the house. I\u0027m early for my shift, with half an hour to spare, so I drop by Beth\u0027s for a coffee and a quick chat. Just my luck that Beth isn\u0027t manning the counter, and I groan inwardly as Raven perks up when she sees me come inside. I have to admit, she\u0027s attractive, and if she weren\u0027t riding the Goth wave a little too hard, and wasn’t working for Beth, I might have hit that in times of need, but as it is I try to limit conversations with her to an absolute minimum. Raven knows what I am, and that\u0027s the only reason she\u0027s trying to follow me around like a fawning little fangirl. She\u0027s not really into BDSM, but apparently her world view dictates that she find herself some asshole who consistently ignores or abuses her. I\u0027ve never given her any reason to believe that I\u0027m even moderately interested in her, but she\u0027s persistent. Unless Beth discourages her, I don\u0027t think she\u0027ll ever give up. But at least that keeps her from falling for that aforementioned kind of guy, so I suffer my lot, mostly, in silence. “Master Edward, it\u0027s so good to welcome you back to our humble establishment,” she drawls, batting her black rimmed eyes at me. I can\u0027t help it, I smirk, because seriously, I\u0027m standing here in my old Nikes and Scrubs, it doesn\u0027t get any farther from your stereotypical Mean Dom look. And Bella must be the only one I ever encountered who gets that randy look on her face when she sees me in scrubs. Not that I mind her scrubs fetish, I mean who protests getting attacked by their girlfriend the moment they come home, but I really don\u0027t see the appeal. Sadly, Raven takes my involuntary mirth as a sign, and dons an even more flirtatious look as she leans towards me over the counter. She\u0027s tall and reed thin, so the move exposes a sliver of skin on her lower back as the silk corset she\u0027s wearing rides up. I tell myself again that in fact I\u0027d never have hit that, as in spanking, as she\u0027s just too frail. Nothing against skinny women, but I like to dig my fingers into some ass, and not have to worry if I\u0027ll bruise myself on those hip bones.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beautiful-disaster-beautiful-1/page-2.html","bookId":2786,"book":{"id":2786,"title":"Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful #1)","description":"Storyline: Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful #1) INTENSE.
