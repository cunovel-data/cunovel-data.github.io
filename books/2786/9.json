{"id":88848,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"“She just said that she doesn\u0027t know if Phil can make it, but she\u0027ll come anyway, because her little girl doesn\u0027t turn a quarter of a century every day.”\n Bella makes a face at that.\n “I swear to you, if you gloat over my age again, I\u0027ll find a way to make you really sorry!”\n Grinning broadly, I place a gentle kiss on her nose before I shuffle discreetly out of her reach.\n “I don\u0027t know what it is with you and your age. It\u0027s totally hot to date an older woman.”\n I\u0027m laughing so hard that I nearly fall from my chair when Bella launches herself at me, and the sudden added weight makes pain radiate from my hip. Ah, the joys of age and of being a randy bastard. It would be easy to subdue the snarling yet tired bundle of energy on my lap, but I let her punch me playfully a few times before I shut her up with a deep kiss. She melts against me, but only for a second, then she\u0027s biting my bottom lip and retreating to her own seat, my insatiable vixen. I consider picking her up and molesting her in one of the dark corners of the huge room right this minute, but Alice\u0027s glare is enough to tame my raging libido to a simmering need.\n Ever since the incident, as Alice refers to it, whatever I do is frowned upon when it comes with even the slightest hint of innuendo. A chaste kiss or innocent touch is okay, but anything more involved than that, and Miss Brandon is frowning her disapproval for everyone to see. If Bella initiates it Alice at least hold her tongue, but woe is me if I show even a hint of dominant behavior, because the pixie will have a field day. While she seemed tolerant enough when I called her after the weekend I was sure had damaged our relationship beyond repair, she\u0027s been regressing ever since. She clearly doesn\u0027t mind Bella and me being together, and I\u0027d even go so far and say she\u0027d pester us about marriage if either of us showed even the slightest inclination that we were ready to tie that knot, but the fact that we have a sex life that\u0027s maybe a little more defined than is the norm seems to disagree with her. Why I have no idea, as I spent nearly an hour explaining myself hoarse that whatever might have happened that week, Bella is my everything and I have no intention of sharing her with anyone else, or go looking for something on the side myself, but she still seems paranoid. I think she even bought my white little lie, as theoretically our scene with Beth was a clear violation of that, but for me, things in the playroom just count as something else.\n And the fact that whenever Jazz and I are in close proximity we both behave like two rabid dogs barely able to hide our hostility behind a pleasant mask should help tidy over her misgivings. After all, she was pretty fast to forgive him for wanting to whore around while making her believe that he\u0027d stay exclusive with her. Why can\u0027t she show me the same courtesy when all I want to do is spend the rest of my life with Bella?\n Meanwhile Bella has saved the day and is once again talking about the party planning, so I return to perusing the menu. We\u0027ve cooked a quick dinner together and eaten right out of the pan, feeding each other and getting more onto the floor than into our mouths, but I so didn\u0027t mind having to lick sauce off her chin. And her cleavage. And in passing lapping and sucking her tormented nipples until she threw her head back and more or less pleaded for me to fuck her again right on the kitchen counter. By then it had been too late for that and we would have likely never made it out of the condo, much to my chagrin. Just thinking about her sensitive nipples makes me hard again, and I’m determined to make up for what I’ve been missing on account of our busy schedule – sooner rather than later.\n “Found anything interesting on the menu that you\u0027ve been staring at for the last ten minutes?”\n I smile at Bella\u0027s whisper into my ear, and shrug mutely. Knowing me well enough after six years, Bella chuckles before biting her lip, intensifying the problem in my now too tight jeans.\n “I think you said the quesadillas are so delicious, right?” It\u0027s oddly comforting that I\u0027m not the only one who has been pestered with the food they serve here. The description of the different fillings sounds mouth-watering enough, and I\u0027m only too happy to let Bella choose which ones we should try.\n “Oh they are!” Alice confirms, doing that annoying clapping thing again.\n “But I can\u0027t eat any, you know, I have to be looking my best next week, and I\u0027ve been living off nothing but carrots for days already.” As if Alice has ever had a single extra gram of body mass. The only reason she hasn\u0027t become a model herself is her height, but she could sweep down any catwalk any day if she wanted without changing her eating habits. On clue Jasper\u0027s stomach rumbles loudly, and I wonder just how far that carrot diet has been extended in their household. The thought cracks me up, and my laughter is apparently contagious, as Bella joins right in.\n “That\u0027s too bad, really,” Bella surmises, still grinning. “But the three of us could share a plate, I mean with all the fillings it\u0027s hard to settle on just one.”\n And people say that foot-in-mouth disease is pathologically occurring in guys only.\n If it weren\u0027t so sad, it would be funny to watch how Alice\u0027s mood changes.\n It\u0027s as if someone pulled a switch from bubbly and exuberant to glaring harpy mode. Equally amusing is the way how Jazz visibly shuts down, only the look of panic in his eyes speaking of what\u0027s going on inside of him. My instinctual reaction is to crack some really bad joke that probably only twelve year olds would find funny, but until four months ago Jazz, Bella, and I weren\u0027t exactly known for the maturity of our humor. Somewhat wiser now I hold my tongue, but it\u0027s so damn hard because Bella is still oblivious of our reactions as she hasn\u0027t looked up from the menu yet.\n Alice is ready to explode, but I know that nothing I can say now will change a thing – it\u0027s Bella\u0027s turn to diffuse the situation, and not even the seconds of loaded silence tip her off how her words might have been perceived. I\u0027m even tempted to wait for things to get worse when she will inevitably vote for her favorite fillings – chicken breast and portobello mushrooms – but I\u0027m afraid that I won\u0027t survive the laughing fit that I will have to succumb to in order not to burst. So I knock my knee discreetly into her thigh in the hope of making her focus on her surroundings.\n “What is it?” Bella absentmindedly grunts, and for a moment Jazz\u0027s and my gaze lock. I see the same urge to laugh about the sheer hilarity of the situation in his eyes, and for a moment the connection we\u0027ve always shared is there again. Years of teasing Bella for her crazy verbal diarrhea, particularly when she\u0027s drunk, have honed our skills to make already funny statements worse, and I even wonder where we find the restraint to hold back. But then reality makes that bubble burst, and I\u0027m feeling positively morose all of a sudden.\n Clearing my throat noisily finally does the trick and Bella looks up, only to find herself at the center of hostile attention. She\u0027s confused for a few moments, her gaze skimming from Jazz to me, until she finally realizes her mistake as she looks over at Alice. Her cheeks flame up immediately, and I can nearly hear the \u0027oh shit!\u0027 that must be zooming through her thoughts.\n More awkward silence ensues, until Bella finally reclaims her voice.\n “Or we\u0027ll just get a plate on our own. I\u0027m too greedy to share anyway.” Not the best save, but it could have been worse. I hurry to flag down a waitress, and Alice slowly calms down while we place our orders. Because now the three of us share the confidence of a tree mold Bella and I get some avocado and mango quesadillas, and Jazz gets his with ham and sour cream. Alice seems pacified enough and more than happy to fill the heavy silence with not exactly amusing tales of how her assistant nearly ruined her latest clothing line.\n By the time the order arrives I\u0027m in dire need of a divine intervention or some booze, preferably both, and Bella doesn\u0027t look too happy, either. The food at least is holding up to expectations, even though the company is somewhat lacking.\n We\u0027re halfway through the quesadillas when Alice gets up, immediately grumpy when Bella doesn\u0027t instantly surge to her feet to follow.\n “Alice, I really don\u0027t have to go to the bathroom ...”\n “Come on, girl-talk time!”\n Apparently all women belong to a secret society so evasion is impossible, and after a last, somewhat panicked look at me, Bella joins Alice, and they leave Jazz and me behind to guard the food, or whatever. In the reality according to Alice, we can\u0027t make stupid remarks, but for some reason it\u0027s still allowed for us guys to hang out, unwatched and unguarded, for five minutes. Or ten. Fuck, I hope it\u0027s only five.\n If the plate sharing comment has been awkward, we need a new word for the atmosphere that is settling on the table now that the girls are gone. For endless minutes Jazz and I both avoid even acknowledging each other\u0027s presence, munching our food and finishing the rest of our beers. The food is tasteless and the beer almost sour, and the resentment and anger inside of me makes me physically ill. I wish I were a smoker so I could use that as an excuse to go outside until the girls return, but in the absence of that I can\u0027t think of any other reason for getting up that won’t make me look like a wimp. So I sit there and stare either at the table or at the people around us, and try hard not to think of anything at all so my mind can\u0027t flip and send me into doing something I will later regret.\n The waitress returns to take our empty plates and glasses away, and remains batting her lashes at us until we both tell her that we\u0027ll get our drinks later directly at the bar. For some reason that breaks our talking embargo, or maybe manners make us feel obliged to have some small talk.\n “How\u0027s it going at the hospital?”\n I shrug as there\u0027s really not much to say.\n “Good, I guess. Working long hours as usual.”\n Jazz nods, looking in my direction but not at me.\n “How\u0027s work?” I remember some detail Bella dropped last week, and in my attempt to appear civil I add, “Did you already launch your company?” He seems surprised that I know that he and two of his co-workers decided to found their own business to get out of corporate hell, and for a moment our gazes cross.\n “Not yet, some bureaucratic crap keeps holding us up. But next week when Alice is in New York I should have the time to get everything sorted out and started. I still have to set up the servers and ...” He trails off and looks away, scratching his head rather self-consciously. No rambling allowed for the wicked.\n “And all that stuff. You know. Geek stuff.”\n I nod even though I don\u0027t really know, and neither do I care. Devoid of any other topic than work, we fall silent again and more agonizing minutes pass.\n “Did you see the Mariners game last Sunday?” he suddenly pipes up, sounding nearly glad that he found something else to say. Or at least he seems like that to me.\n “Nope. Double shift from Saturday till Sunday, and I was on call after that –\n and they did call, so I didn\u0027t even catch the re-runs.”\n “That\u0027s nasty. Was a good game.” I have no idea if the note of sympathy in his voice is real. It doesn\u0027t matter anyway.\n More silence, but now it\u0027s a hint more relaxed. Those twenty sentences are more than we\u0027ve spoken in – forever. As much as I hate to be sitting here, I feel weirdly melancholic all of a sudden. For years we\u0027ve been hanging out most of our free time, rooming together since college. And now all we can talk about is work and some stupid baseball game.\n The more I think of that, the more uncomfortable I am, and just to get rid of that feeling I blurt out the first thing that comes to my mind.\n “How are things with you and Alice? I mean -”\n I trail off there because what I want to ask him is if it was worth all the shit, but he gets it without me having to actually voice the words. A somewhat guarded look haunts his eyes for a moment, but then he smiles, and it\u0027s the first real emotion that Jazz has shown the whole evening until now.\n “Seriously, she drives me crazy, but that\u0027s Alice. Wouldn\u0027t want to change a single thing, even if I could.”\n I don\u0027t know why, but his words take a few moments to draw that animalistic pain from deep in my chest, and until then I actually feel myself being happy for them. Maybe Alice is right, maybe they really are soulmates and meant to be together. Bella certainly thinks they deserve each other, and right now I agree. If he\u0027s what Alice wants, she should be happy with Jazz. And for a few seconds I can even admit that I kind of want to see him happy, too.\n But then the rational part of my brain is lost to the rage and agony crashing over me like a tidal wave, and the urge to punch him until he’s paid for what he’s done is nearly overwhelming. Only the fact that, despite whatever he was trying to accomplish, Bella\u0027s love for me was strong enough to cut through his plans is holding me back. If nothing else I owe her enough to honor her forgiveness, even though I don\u0027t understand it. For her I can keep it together, if not get over things as fast as everyone expects me to.\n While I do a good job holding myself in check, I don\u0027t doubt that the look on my face must be murderous, and after a few moments Jazz\u0027s words confirm that suspicion.\n “Fuck, Edward, you know how I meant that, I didn\u0027t want to -”\n “I know exactly how you mean it,” I bite back and make eye contact with him to underline my words. “Trust me, I\u0027m living with the results of your little plan every fucking day, and I\u0027m the only one who has had to bear all the fucking consequences!”\n Thankfully the girls come back before I can say anything still more embarrassing, and the weird look on Jasper\u0027s face helps only so much to tide over the grim feelings still fighting for dominance inside me. The moment Bella slips into her seat I get up, in terrible need of letting off some steam any way I can.\n “Drinks, ladies? What so you think of a round of shots to start the evening off, on me?”\n Bella graces me with a long look but nods immediately, and Alice follows suit. No one mentions the evident hostility the girls have come back to, so I try my best to play things down.\n “Let me guess, three shots of tequila, and what can I bring you, dearest Alice mine?”\n For some reason or other she\u0027s scowling again, but I know that tequila just makes her sick, while it\u0027s been the drug of choice for the rest of us.\n “Jazz and I both take a shot of gin.”\n I have to bite the inside of my cheek hard not to burst out laughing, and can somehow still turn that into a smirk when Jasper\u0027s shoulders sag in a mute sigh where Alice can\u0027t see it, but he nods.\n “Gin for me, too, please.”\n Bella blinks in irritation, knowing as well as I do that Jazz only drinks gin –\n preferably warm – when he has to make himself hurl, but apparently the leash Alice put around his neck is tight enough that he doesn\u0027t dare speak up against her.\n I nod and take off towards the bar, aiming for the straightest line I can manage. Our waitress is now mixing drinks there, and I place my order –\n four shots of tequila oro and two shots of gin. I tip her extra for asking if we want salt and limes, or cinnamon and oranges, and I tell her to put both in the tray. While she\u0027s busy slicing the orange I chuck down two of the tequila shots, not bothering with the whole ritual but welcoming the raw burn down my throat and straight into my stomach.\n “Let me guess, one of the girls has been the other\u0027s girlfriend, right? Only rivalry over some pussy can get guys this riled up.” I stare at her, but her bright grin doesn\u0027t even falter.\n “Nope. Good guess, but completely off.”\n The waitress taps one lacquered nail against the wood of the bar.\n “That\u0027s weird, really, because I remember you two being pretty tight. I mean your friend\u0027s Jasper Whitlock, and you\u0027re Edward Cullen.” I\u0027m not even surprised that she knows Jazz, I wouldn\u0027t even be surprised to find out that she knows him, but usually his skanks don\u0027t recognize me, and I\u0027d certainly remember her if she\u0027d been one of our few mutual pickups.\n Contrary to him I remember all the faces and names of the girls I\u0027ve fucked.\n I still have to ask, out of curiosity.\n “Oh, I\u0027ve been working at Zero\u0027s before I got the job here, I remember you guys hanging out there sometimes. Come to think of it,” she muses, then puts the small dish with the orange and lime slices next to the shots before she reaches for a pen and napkin.\n “If either, or both, of you guys find yourself alone without the ladies, give me-”\n “Don\u0027t even bother,” I cut her off rudely, my voice harsh enough to make her stop in mid scrawl. When she eyes me askance, I feel a little bad for being so nasty, but I don\u0027t want Bella to know about this, and I certainly don\u0027t trust Jazz.\n “I\u0027m engaged, and his relationship is pretty serious, you\u0027d just wait forever for a call that will never come.”\n A shrewd look lights up her face and her smile is bordering on dirty, but she throws the napkin right into the trash.\n “Too bad. Or what is it they say, all the good guys are either married, or they\u0027re gay.”\n I don\u0027t know why, but her words hit a little too close to home. I shrug them off as I pick up the small tray.\n “Whatever.”\n I try to shake off the feeling that she\u0027s still smirking at me as I make my way back to the others, and thankfully the air has cleared in my short absence.\n Bella is ecstatic that I remembered her new habit of drinking tequila, picked up from some German exchange student who was been interning over the summer at her job and gleefully reaches for the cinnamon. Bella is nibbling on her orange slice before she finishes the second one off, all the while glancing at me from the corner of her eye. I\u0027m pretty sure that means that she has an idea why there were four slices for only two shots, but I don\u0027t care. Three shots in as many minutes zoom right into my blood stream, and my grumpiness starts to dissolve.\n I\u0027m not afraid of getting drunk, I even welcome it. I\u0027m more prone to say something I will regret later when I\u0027m sober, as my mind is more easily distracted by the beautiful woman leaning into me when I\u0027m intoxicated, and distracted is good. The girls keep giggling over something for a while, but before long I can\u0027t keep my hands to myself. When she feels my bare palm slide over her lower back underneath her top, Bella grins at me, then she takes my other hand and tugs me off my chair and towards the dance floor.\n Her eyes are glinting with mischief when we reach the dance floor, and the next moment she turns around and rubs her ass shamelessly against my thighs and crotch. I\u0027m instantly hard, and for now only too ready to forget we\u0027re not quite on our own here. Bella laughs delightedly when I grab her hips and start to move with her, and I have a feeling that the night might be picking up from here on.\n Chapter 9\n The hypnotic rhythm of the music around me. The warm, willing body pressed against my own. Movement, slow and sensual, fast and passionate. It only takes a few minutes for me to lose myself until I can let go and just enjoy.\n Dancers are all around us, and many of them are moving with more skill than we are, but there are too many people here to dance for real. I don\u0027t care, and Bella doesn’t seem to either, as she\u0027s laughing and grinning at me when she isn\u0027t molding herself against me. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beautiful-disaster-beautiful-1/page-9.html","bookId":2786,"book":{"id":2786,"title":"Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful #1) \n INTENSE.
