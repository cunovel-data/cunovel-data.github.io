{"id":88865,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\"Fisting huh? Always looks hot on the vids.\" Trust it to Rose not to bat an eyelash. Her blasé tone is refreshing, but when I look from her to the still empty door I hear her sigh.\\n\\n \"Come on, don\u0027t be an ass, go hunt her down and talk to her. Even I get what a headdesk kind of remark that must have been to her. I\u0027ll be fine here, I\u0027m sure the moment you\u0027re gone that nurse will be back to tell me some shit like that my blood pressure is to high or that my breathing technique sucks or something.\"\\n\\n I still hesitate, but the next moment I hear Emmett\u0027s voice outside in the hallway, and the way Rose\u0027s face lights up I know I can leave her for now.\\n\\n Rose\u0027s room is near the end of the corridor so I guess Bella must have taken off in the other direction. As I round the first corner the nurse\u0027s station comes into view where Emmett is right now trying to find out where his wife is, while Alice and Jasper are waiting to the side.\\n\\n \"She must have arrived maybe fifteen minutes ago? Long, blond hair, pregnant?\"\\n\\n I can hear the nurse\u0027s exasperated sigh from across the hall – asking for a pregnant woman at the maternity ward is kind of a stupid thing to do, but I\u0027m sure that of the two, Rose is the more focused one. In fact Emmett seems a step away from hyperventilating and I hurry over to show him the way.\\n\\n Once Em is set on his course I try to decide where to search first, but Alice thankfully interprets my confused glance around right.\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re looking for Bella, I saw her head for the restrooms over there.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks, you\u0027re the best, Alice.\"\\n\\n She smiles, then shrugs.\\n\\n \"Is she sick or something, it must have been close to five minutes and I haven\u0027t seen her come out again. If you want to I can go inside and check on her.\"\\n\\n Which would probably be as bad as it can get.\\n\\n Trying not to let her see how much the idea unnerves me, I shake my head.\\n\\n \"Thanks but I don\u0027t think that\u0027s necessary. Probably only an upset stomach or something. Or she\u0027s reading her emails.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m not surprised that Alice buys my somewhat lame answer – maybe she just wants to believe it – but Jazz keeps eyeing me askance for a while longer. I return his questioning gaze with a blank stare, and before either of us can say something Alice is already tugging him along towards Rosalie\u0027s room.\\n\\n I\u0027m even considering going into the restroom but just as I reach the door it opens, a woman in her middle years, probably a grandma-soon-to-be, exits. She eyes me up and down, then indicates the by now closed door at her back.\\n\\n \"Is that your girlfriend sitting on the toilet and crying her eyes out?\"\\n\\n My heart sinks at hearing that, the realization probably plain on my face because she goes on before I can even give her an answer.\\n\\n \"Listen to me buddy, you seem old enough not to knock up the first girl you lay your eyes on. You better make it up to her, will you?\"\\n\\n I fully intend to, although the reason for Bella\u0027s distress is probably something this woman couldn\u0027t even wrap her head around. When she keeps glaring at me I nod, but then give her the retort her unwanted advice is asking for.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s not pregnant, we\u0027re just here because a friend of ours is having her baby. Not that it\u0027s any of your business.\"\\n\\n The woman looks first angry, then a little appalled, and she steps around me before I can say anything further. Not that I intend to.\\n\\n Hesitating for a moment longer I\u0027m surprised when the door opens again and Bella steps out. Her still somewhat puffy but now dry eyes widen when she sees me hovering right before the restroom, and a hint of a smile appears on her face.\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t even let me go to the toilet without missing me, huh?\"\\n\\n \"Not when you run off like that, ready to burst into tears any moment.\"\\n\\n She frowns, but now she\u0027s avoiding my gaze.\\n\\n \"Puking, actually, but never mind, I\u0027m good now.\"\\n\\n When she sees my raised brows she sighs, then rubs her eyes.\\n\\n \"Look, Edward, can we please not do this here? I really appreciate your concern, but now\u0027s not the time and I\u0027d really like to have that talk where less than half the hospital can hear us.\"\\n\\n I nod, if slowly, then reach up so gently cradle her cheek. Her smile widens, and for a moment her eyes close as she relaxes into my touch.\\n\\n \"We can go home, too. Right now. I\u0027m sure Rose will do just fine without two more people standing around uselessly, too.\"\\n\\n Bella shakes her head.\\n\\n \"No, of course we stay. She called you first, we can\u0027t just leave her now.\"\\n\\n \"But if you\u0027re not feeling welll-\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine, okay?\"\\n\\n I cock a brow at her suddenly acidic tone, and after a moment she steps away from me and starts walking down the way we\u0027ve come.\\n\\n \"Come on, unless you want to hear any more theories about what sordid things we might have been up to in the meantime. And I doubt that this time Rose will be standing guard in front of the restroom door again.\"\\n\\n She extends her hand towards me – a peace offering in more than one way\\n\\n – and I let her drag me back to the others. Part of me wants to make her talk to me right now, but if I\u0027ve learned anything about Bella in the past years it\u0027s how stubborn she can be, a trait\u0027s she clearly inherited from Charlie. And what can a few hours hurt?\\n\\n By the time we join the others to crowd Rose\u0027s room Bella is acting nearly her usual self. At least until Jazz tries to draw her to the side, probably to ask if she\u0027s okay. She shies away from him, enough to bump into one of the cabinets. Yet when she rounds on him her glare is close to furious, and heads turn all over at her hissed, \"Leave me the fuck alone!\"\\n\\n Jazz seems as perplexed at her reaction as I am but he doesn\u0027t reply anything, nor does he try to touch her again or even talk to her. I feel his eyes move over to me but I pointedly study one of the monitors instead. If anything, Bella\u0027s behavior confuses me more as she\u0027s been back to hugging and casually touching Jazz for months, even under Alice\u0027s watchful eyes. It doesn\u0027t make any sense, and I\u0027m starting to realize that there\u0027s a lot more going on than I\u0027ve thought.\\n\\n For once ignoring what I can\u0027t deal with right now seems like the best idea, and before long Rose distracts us all with her colorful language. Hours pass, and eventually everyone except Emmett is kicked out of the room to give Rose some well needed space.\\n\\n At eight in the evening Alice and Jasper decide to make a quick dash for the take-out around the corner, and Bella joins them, leaving me behind to wait here. They make it back just in time for Em to come running towards us, still clad in the scrubs the nurses pretty much had to force him into, hollering loudly.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a girl! We have a baby girl!\"\\n\\n I\u0027m a little surprised that he hasn\u0027t known before but then I can still remember Rose\u0027s laments about him insisting that it should be a surprise.\\n\\n We barely have the time to congratulate him, then he\u0027s running back to join his wife. An hour later the nurse finally lets us see Rose. She looks exhausted but happy, with the barest of frowns on her face. At my cautious question she shrugs.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s nothing, but because Mona was so antsy to stop kicking her mommy in the belly they want to keep her under observations for the night. If I\u0027m lucky they\u0027ll bring her up tomorrow morning.\"\\n\\n She hesitates for a moment, her eyes turning pleading.\\n\\n \"Can you maybe talk with the doc there, see if she\u0027s really okay? She was crying and all so she should be fine, but they told me she\u0027s a little small, and, you know, terribly concerned mom here.\"\\n\\n \"Of course. I\u0027ll be right back.\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t have to go look for her doctor for long as she\u0027s still with the two nurses who take care of the newborns. Few words are exchanged, and she assures me that little Mona is healthy as a bug. She\u0027s more concerned with Rose\u0027s blood work, but mother and child should be able to leave the hospital early next week.\\n\\n Em, who has followed me over, is near ecstatic when I tell him the good news, and he bustles off to let Rose know. I linger a little longer, looking at the handful of newborns, all in their cribs, most of them sleeping peacefully.\\n\\n I know some people find babies simply adorable, but right now they scare me. Years I\u0027ve dreamed about having a family with Bella, but since we\u0027ve hooked up and reality has replaced idle fantasy I\u0027m in no hurry to start one myself. We still have enough trouble just going through our lives without a baby complicating things, as it is.\\n\\n I hear steps approaching and think it\u0027s probably Bella, but when I look to my side it\u0027s Alice who is staring at the babies now, the expected awe and happiness plain on her face. Jazz is trailing behind her, looking a little wary, but the moment Alice turns to him he\u0027s smiling back at her.\\n\\n \"Just so you know, I want at least two of them! For starters. And once they can run on their own a whole bunch more!\" she informs him.\\n\\n Inside I cringe, but Jazz doesn\u0027t even tense up, but instead hugs Alice from behind and nuzzles her neck until she squeals.\\n\\n \"As many as you want, Alice, as many as you want.\"\\n\\n They keep this up for a moment longer, but then Alice extracts herself from his arms and with a last grin in my direction skips off down the hall, probably to tell everyone about her congenial plan to populate the world with her mini-me minions.\\n\\n Silence is heavy between Jazz and me, and for a while I contemplate not saying anything at all. But quite frankly, right now he looks only a tad better than Bella did when we got here, so I finally open my mouth.\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t tell her yet?\" I venture a guess, trying to keep my voice level but a hint of sympathy leaks through.\\n\\n Jazz hunches his shoulders for a moment, looking defiant, but when I don\u0027t add the jibe he\u0027s probably expecting, he shrugs.\\n\\n \"Somehow topics like \u0027hey, remember that motorcycle accident I had when I was twenty? They said I was lucky, not bleeding to death from my ruptured femoral artery when I had that piece of scrap metal jabbed deep into my hip. Well turns out there was some damage after all, and since then my sperm is about as sterile as if you\u0027d mix it with acid. I can still fuck like a Trojan but no blond sunnyboy babies will ever come from these loins\u0027 never come up in dinner conversations.\"\\n\\n As usual at that point I don\u0027t know what to say – I mean what can you say to something like that? I understand why he never told Alice – or as far as I know, Bella – but I have a feeling that might change soon now. And it\u0027s not gonna be a conversation he\u0027ll look forward to.\\n\\n Maybe it\u0027s because things between us have reached a certain non-hostile truce, or because while I sometimes still hate his guts he seems really down right now, but I feel like I have to do something, so I reach out and squeeze his shoulder briefly. He looks at me surprised but then offers a grateful nod in return.\\n\\n \"You know it\u0027s gonna be all right. I mean it\u0027s not your fault.\"\\n\\n \"For once,\" he mutters, but when he sees me smirk rather than frown he shrugs. \"I know Alice isn\u0027t into me for my baby making potential. But you know how she can get when someone rains on her parade.\"\\n\\n I nod. \"Sure, but she\u0027ll get a grip on herself soon enough. Or maybe she\u0027ll take it in stride and just shrug it off. Predictability was never her strong suit.\"\\n\\n Jazz grins, then looks back at the sleeping babies.\\n\\n \"Maybe she\u0027ll change her mind anyway the first time Rose lets her change the diapers. You never know.\"\\n\\n With that I turn around to head back to the others when Jazz speaks up again, his tone cautious.\\n\\n \"Everything okay with you and Bella? She seems somewhat off today.\"\\n\\n My first impulse is to bark out that it\u0027s none of his business but the fact that he cares for her and got the brunt end of her unease already makes me rethink my answer. And it feels good not to be at each other\u0027s throats for once, so I finally decide on a nod.\\n\\n \"She is, but she will be all right soon enough. Just bad timing and all that.\\n\\n And yes, couldn\u0027t be better.\"\\n\\n The fact that he looks happy to hear that weirds me out a little, and feeling obliged to I ask the same about him and Alice.\\n\\n \"Couldn\u0027t be better,\" he echoes me, underlining his words with a smile.\\n\\n \"Although you might wanna check back in with her after that talk we\u0027re going to have.\"\\n\\n I leave it at that and head back to the others, repeating the news Em has already relayed. Rose is looking a little better already, although tired as she is we should probably leave her alone with Em soon. Bella sighs contently as she leans against me after I snake my arm around her waist and draw her close, and even though I know we\u0027ll have to work through what has happened earlier soon I\u0027m confident it won\u0027t be too bad, relaxed as she seems by now.\\n\\n Then Rose\u0027s parents arrive and we take our leave, using the opportunity to congratulate the happy young family again. Yet just outside of the room I hear a familiar voice behind me, so I turn around, Bella still hugged to my side. Dr. Amanda Blake, my current mentor, looks up from the patient file she\u0027s reading right then, smiling absentmindedly at me.\\n\\n \"Hi Edward,\" she greets me, then looks from me to Bella, seeming a little surprised. \"Family planning time already?\"\\n\\n Bella laughs at that, shaking her head. I\u0027m relieved that she sounds about her usual self again.\\n\\n \"Ah, no, a friend of ours had her first baby today. We\u0027re just standing around uselessly, well, Edward got to translate some doctorspeak to what the rest of the world understands, but that\u0027s about it. I\u0027m Bella, nice to meet you.\"\\n\\n \"Amanda.\"\\n\\n They shake hands, both women immediately taking to each other in their informal way. I\u0027m a little dumbstruck as my mentor is usually very close to\\n\\n \u0027abrasive bitch\u0027 as they get, but we always get along perfectly. She really seems to like Bella as she\u0027s as friendly as I\u0027ve ever seen her, but maybe it\u0027s because away from the Emergency Room she can let her guard down.\\n\\n Maybe the reason she and I get along is that she\u0027s had her problems with various colleagues before, but except for a few rumors I haven\u0027t found out why. She\u0027s definitely one of the best, if not the best surgeon in the hospital, and I\u0027m glad she\u0027s taken me under her wings. She\u0027s also the only one of the residents I\u0027m on first name basis with, probably because she doesn\u0027t seem to think everyone fresh out of med school has to be treated like an imbecile.\\n\\n Then Amanda turns back to me and the pleasant look leaves her face.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m aware this is probably a bad time, and I know you\u0027re off rotation until tomorrow evening, but we\u0027ve just got an interesting case in. Climbing accent, patient\u0027s brain dead and I just got the okay from his parents for the organ donations. I know technically Hills is up for assisting me, but quite frankly I\u0027d rather have you there. If you can make time for a multi organ extraction and liver transplant, that is.\"\\n\\n Fuck. Talk about bad timing. But for once I know where my priorities lie, and I\u0027m already shaking my head when Bella pokes me in the ribs.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be stupid, of course you\u0027ll stay here for that!\"\\n\\n Unable to hide my surprise I look at her, and she rolls her eyes before she turns to Amanda.\\n\\n \"Please let me talk to Edward for a moment? You can have him right away after that.\"\\n\\n Amanda grins, then winks at me.\\n\\n \"See you in 20 downstairs for scrubbing in.\"\\n\\n Apparently I don\u0027t have a say in this so I nod, still perplexed about Bella\u0027s reaction but let her drag me away into one of the more secluded waiting areas. When we\u0027re alone I turn to her, but she\u0027s already talking before I can do more than open my mouth.\\n\\n \"Please don\u0027t be stupid, I know how much you want to do this, I mean even if I didn\u0027t give a shit about your work and career – which is so not the case as you know – I\u0027d understand how important and interesting this must be for you. Don\u0027t miss this just because you\u0027re getting all overprotective now.\"\\n\\n \"Overprotective? You crashed, then you ran and puked and cried, I don\u0027t think I should leave you all on your own tonight.\"\\n\\n She sighs, a weary sound, and rubs her eyes before she looks back at me.\\n\\n \"Edward, look, I know I\u0027ve been a mess today. And still am, kinda, but I\u0027m feeling a lot more like myself by now. And I\u0027m not trying to avoid having that talk, it\u0027s just that...\" she stops, then sighs again. \"I need a little \u0027me\u0027 time right now. And while I\u0027d love to cuddle the whole night with you I\u0027ll survive on my own with a pint of ice cream for a substitute. I\u0027d just feel worse if I knew you\u0027d miss this because of me.\"\\n\\n I can tell already that I\u0027m fighting a losing battle here, but I still have to try.\\n\\n \"People have accidents all the time, I\u0027ll get another chance at assisting at something like this soon again.\"\\n\\n \"Please?\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t know what to say but my silence seems to stress her more, so I draw her closer to me and kiss her gently. She melts against me after a moment, but pushes away faster than I want her to.\\n\\n \"Remember when you told me about how you were struggling to come to terms with your kinky side? And that I might eventually have to go through that, too? I think that\u0027s what\u0027s going on with me now. Not in a denial or \u0027woe is me\u0027 kind of way, but -,\" she breaks off again, then starts anew. \"You really don\u0027t have to worry about me, I\u0027m fine. Yes, I was somewhat beside myself when we got here, but I\u0027ve had enough time to clear my head and calm down. But my mind\u0027s still a mess and I just need time to sort it out.\\n\\n And maybe you not being around tonight will even help me? I know that sounds bad, but do you understand what I\u0027m trying to say here? I just need some time to sort this out for myself.\"\\n\\n I nod – there\u0027s not really much I can do at this point. And I actually understand her a lot better than she probably thinks, having been at that point more than once – or even ten times – in my life.\\n\\n \"Are you sure you will be okay?\"\\n\\n \"I am,\" she assures me immediately. \"And if not I\u0027ll call Beth, or your mom, or Alice to stay with me. It\u0027s not like I don\u0027t know anyone who\u0027ll share some comfort food with me gladly.\"\\n\\n \"But we\u0027ll talk about this.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, we will,\" she promises. \"And if I need you to help me sort it all out, I know where to find you. But please, give me some time here, okay?\"\\n\\n \"Sure, however long you need,\" I assure her, then kiss her again, letting the gesture show all the support my words lack.\\n\\n We spend a few more minutes there before I have to go, and while part of me is a little angry at her for pushing me away like that, I trust her that she knows what she\u0027s doing. After a last kiss I bring her to the elevator, then take the stairs down to the ER, trying to ready myself for the unexpected workload ahead of me as fast as I can.\\n\\n And that\u0027s the last we talk about what what has happened on that Saturday for a full week. First I\u0027m not home, then Bella has to do extra hours for the magazine she\u0027s writing for, and way too soon it\u0027s Friday evening again.\\n\\n Finally home after a grueling forty hours in the hospital all I really want to do is take a shower and sleep for a month, I know that\u0027s not gonna happen when I see Bella waiting for me on the sofa, looking all wound up and wringing her hands. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beautiful-disaster-beautiful-1/page-26.html","bookId":2786,"book":{"id":2786,"title":"Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful #1)","description":"Storyline: Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful #1) \\n INTENSE.
