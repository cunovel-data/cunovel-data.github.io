He should have seen that. Heck, you should have seen that! Friends with benefits who fuck every once in a while when we\u0027re both horny and no one else is at hand, sure, but not living together, not being a couple, not trying to build a family and get old together! I kept trying to make him see that but he wouldn\u0027t, I did every insane thing I could think of to make him realize that we wouldn\u0027t work, but it was as if he had made it the center of his world. He was obsessed with that idea of us, and it killed me every damn day to see him like that.\\n\\n \"For a while I was hoping that Bella would drag him out of it, but for once she didn\u0027t act like she had to save him from me. And you, you weren\u0027t helping with your moping around and hostility, changing moods so quickly it gave me whiplash when I might have tried to talk to you. I was reaching for the last straw when I tried to find a connection between us again, but I couldn\u0027t go on with that, I knew you\u0027d hate me for what I said to Jazz when I broke up with him. Had to, or else he would have found another reason to try to hang on. Do you have any idea how hard it is to repel someone you know loves you and who you, on some level, love back?\"\\n\\n She\u0027s crying by then but only glares at me when I start to get up, so I remain sitting and just watch her as she blows her nose and wipes her eyes until she can talk with a shaky voice again.\\n\\n \"I really don\u0027t want your sympathy, I did what I did and I won\u0027t justify it with any stupid excuses. I got what I deserve, although it was something different than I expected. I got to finally see through all my own bullshit and turn my life around. If getting there cost me my closest friends, I can\u0027t change that. I really am so sorry for what I did and what I said, but it\u0027s done, and I have to move on. If it helps, I never had any problems with the choices you made, or your sexuality. I want no part of it, I don\u0027t understand it, and I guess because of that, aspects of it repel and frighten me. But I know that both you and Jazz are good guys, and if that\u0027s your thing, it can\u0027t be that bad.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m happy for you if you think things will work out for you both with Bella, and I wish you all the best. Yes, I\u0027m resentful of your happiness, but you\u0027ve earned it, and I think that, given enough time and effort on my side, I will either make things work with Nate, or find someone else. I won\u0027t ask you to forgive me because I won\u0027t believe you if you say you do. I\u0027m not that person anymore, and I would love to get to know who you\u0027ve grown up to be if you want to see who I really am, but if not, I will learn to live with that, too.\"\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t expected to hear something like that from her ever, and to honor her honesty I don\u0027t say anything, but instead answer her previous question, the weight already lifting from my heart.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s anything in the world you could say or do that would make Bella consider you a friend. You ridiculed her twice in front of everyone, you hurt the two people she cares about the most, and to her way of thinking, you\u0027ve already fucked up your second chance.\"\\n\\n Alice takes that in without showing any emotion, then nods for me to go on.\\n\\n \"Jazz – I really don\u0027t know,\" I sigh. \"He\u0027s hurt, damaged even, but I think he\u0027s healing well and finally got the message you were trying to make him see. I don\u0027t know if he could try to be friends with you, or would even want to. I know he doesn\u0027t hate you. I think he still loves you.\"\\n\\n I try to be as honest in my assessment as possible, even if the words pain me. Not just because of the sympathy I always feel for him, but mostly because I think I would have acted the same way. Somehow it rankles that while there\u0027s nothing there between them anymore, he still wants her on some level or another. While she tries to remain indifferent, I see the pain in her eyes, and her tone is dejected when she answers.\\n\\n \"Guess that\u0027s more than I could have hoped for. And you?\"\\n\\n That answer is much easier to find, if not exactly easy to give.\\n\\n \"I think I\u0027d like to get to know the new Alice. She reminds me of someone I used to know, but kind of lost contact with over the last few years.\"\\n\\n She offers me a weak smile, mirroring my own sentiments perfectly.\\n\\n \"Even if your two plus ones, or is that your plus twos? Whatever, even if they probably disapprove of our association?\"\\n\\n \"No one tells me who to see and talk to, and that doesn\u0027t change whether I live with one person or two. They\u0027ll have to get over it. And I know that eventually they will.\"\\n\\n I guess the old Alice would have squeed and hugged me now, but the more sober version of her now leaves it at that sad smile.\\n\\n \"Well then, how about we meet for coffee next week again? And if things work out, I might beg you to look after the cat when I\u0027m in London. I can\u0027t really leave him alone and I don\u0027t know too many people who I would want to give the keys of the apartment to, either. Your mom already offered but it\u0027s nearly an hours\u0027 drive for her, and Rose can\u0027t really go outside with the baby when it\u0027s so cold.\"\\n\\n \"Sure, just tell me and I\u0027ll come over.\"\\n\\n \"Great. Thanks.\"\\n\\n And just like that, we run out of things to talk about. A first for us, but without her constant need to put herself in the limelight, we\u0027ll probably need a little time to find a slightly different dynamic in our conversations.\\n\\n Still, things are more or less comfortable when we hug good-bye – a warm, close body contact hug, not the air kisses she used to give – and I leave her with the cat on the couch and let myself out. In the hallway, just after donning my coat, I notice a picture frame face down on the mantle of the wardrobe. It\u0027s the only one left in the whole apartment, another weird thing I\u0027ve noticed as she had pictures everywhere before. Curious, I pick it up and turn it over. It\u0027s a picture of the four of us – me, Bella, Alice and Jazz –\\n\\n from our vacation together in Mexico. Must have been taken on the last day as I\u0027m badly sunburned with freckles all over my nose, Bella is sporting a killer tan, Alice\u0027s hair isn\u0027t impeccably styled, and Jazz is still looking vaguely hungover.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know why but I feel compelled to stand it up on the wardrobe, leaving it there like that.\\n\\n Xxx\\n\\n The talk with Alice has left me drained, but oddly happy at the same time. I keep mulling over what she said on the way back home, trying to come up with a good explanation as to why I didn\u0027t catch on to any of this, but I come up blank. I\u0027ve been too concerned with my own bullshit to deal with hers, and in the end it doesn\u0027t matter as she should have been able to do it on her own, or ask for my help outright.\\n\\n Seeing that picture in the hallway also made me realize that all of us have been through a journey, each in our own way. Not long after the picture was taken, I fell for Tanya, Bella wavered around until she convinced herself that I would never want her, Alice turned away from all of us because she thought – rightly so – that we were a bunch of immature children, and Jazz dragged along a girl named Brenda. In a way we could have spared ourselves all the years of emotional pain, because a mere six months after that picture was taken we got about to where we are now, minus a lot of experience and a few funny anecdotes, but still.\\n\\n Somehow that makes me sad at all the wasted time we would never get back, but at the same time it solidifies my conviction that we\u0027ll make it work.\\n\\n And by \"we\" I mean Bella, Jazz and myself. Whether things with Alice work out or not is out of my control, and no longer the festering wound that has been plaguing me for months.\\n\\n All that mulling over old times leaves me in a surprisingly good mood, at least until I get home and can already hear Bella and Jazz before I even reach the door. They are at it again – fighting, and only fighting, as I\u0027ve had to find out the hard way. For a moment the temptation is strong to just turn around and come back in an hour when hopefully the worst has blown over. Then I can pick up the pieces and try to mend things with sweet words and not-so-sweet fucking, but I force myself to take those last steps and unlock the door.\\n\\n I don\u0027t see them in the living room, but they are loud enough that their voices reach me as they keep shouting at each other.\\n\\n \"How is it possible that you\u0027re such an idiot?\" Bella accuses Jazz, then interrupts his fleeting attempt at a response. \"I mean, you know how he is!\\n\\n The guy who needed five years and God knows how many pep talks from you to even \u0027fess up to me that he wanted to fuck me! You can\u0027t really expect him to have changed any in the past months!\"\\n\\n Oh great, they\u0027re fighting about me. My curiosity piqued, I remain leaning against the entry door, attempting not to make a sound as I strain my ears trying to pick up every word they utter.\\n\\n Jazz snorts.\\n\\n \"Trust me, it took more like a week and you slinking around in a tiny, white bikini for him to realize that!\"\\n\\n \"Glad you\u0027re so insightful when it comes to others but not to yourself!\" she screams back. \"Don\u0027t you see that this is not going to just resolve itself? I can see how much you\u0027re hurting, and by proxy that\u0027s hurting me, too! He won\u0027t change, he won\u0027t get his head out of his ass, now even less when he\u0027s got your cock shoved up there on a regular basis. You need to talk to him!\"\\n\\n \"But I can\u0027t!\" comes the pained yet angry answer.\\n\\n \"Then I will!\"\\n\\n \"No! You can\u0027t!\"\\n\\n \"Says who? You don\u0027t really know me if you think I have a problem telling him that -\"\\n\\n \"Please don\u0027t then! This is my business, not yours. I\u0027m so fed up with you thinking that you\u0027re Little Miss Congeniality! You don\u0027t know the solution to every fucking problem in the universe!\"\\n\\n That shuts her up, but only for a moment.\\n\\n \"And maybe I\u0027m fucking sick of watching either you or him moping around! I can\u0027t remember the last time when we had a whole weekend without any drama or mood swings that we didn\u0027t spend fucking from sunup to sundown, and then some!\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, maybe that\u0027s because the only way you shut up is when you\u0027re sucking on someone\u0027s cock!\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t just say that!\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I did, and I can say it again if you don\u0027t shut up -\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t get to tell me to shut up! But maybe listening for once in your life would help? But, oh, no, it\u0027s so much easier to just wallow in silence and kill everyone else\u0027s joy with your brooding, right? The moment he gets home I\u0027m going to tell him. Deal with it!\"\\n\\n Her declaration is underlined by the click of the bedroom door being closed, then opened a moment later as Jazz follows her, both of them coming down the stairs. I know that any second now they will see me, but before I can make up my mind what to do about that, it is too late.\\n\\n Bella looks furious, as if her tone and words hadn\u0027t been a dead giveaway, and all of that rage comes bearing down on me now when she sees me standing just inside the door. Yet instead of getting right in my face she draws it all in, assuming that fragile calm that I\u0027ve come to fear, as it means that she\u0027s totally pissed beyond reason.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re late.\"\\n\\n The words are precise and bitten off, accusation making her eyes hard and unbidding.\\n\\n \"I am?\" I ask lamely, not remembering if we have agreed to me being home after work or not.\\n\\n \"Yes. I called the hospital two hours ago and they told me your shift had ended before noon. And now it\u0027s five in the afternoon.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m about to make up some excuse, then decide to stick to the truth, but then the meaning of her words hit me.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re calling after me? Are you checking up on me or something?\"\\n\\n Try as I might, that comes out as an accusation, and I can see the tension in her rising.\\n\\n \"Do I need to?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t think so, but then again I didn\u0027t think you would call my work to find out whether I was hiding something from you or not.\"\\n\\n She doesn\u0027t even look chagrined when she answers.\\n\\n \"I was calling because I wanted to know when you\u0027d be home, to figure out whether or not I should cook something or order take-out and have you pick it up on the way over. Sorry that I\u0027m annoying you so much by trying to be a good girlfriend and providing food for when you come home, starving, as usual, because there are only six supermarkets and ten restaurants in the next three blocks from here!\"\\n\\n Talk about bad timing if there ever was any. My stomach chooses that moment to rumble loudly, and in a bout of insanity I ask, \"Well, did you cook?\"\\n\\n \"Fuck you!\"\\n\\n As Jazz doesn\u0027t join in our \u0027conversation\u0027 I try to defuse it, telling myself that someone has to try to act maturely for once.\\n\\n \"Well, if you need to know, I went over to Alice\u0027s.\"\\n\\n Bella\u0027s eyes narrow upon hearing that.\\n\\n \"You did what?\"\\n\\n \"We talked. Just because you start foaming at the mouth whenever someone mentions her doesn\u0027t mean I have to break off all contact with her.\"\\n\\n For a moment Bella looks as if I had slapped her, and not in a playroom-friendly kind of way, then she rounds on Jazz, screeching as she points her finger at me.\\n\\n \"THIS is exactly what I\u0027ve been talking about! He\u0027d rather hang out and talk to that fucking cunt instead of either of us! And now he\u0027ll have his panties in a twist for weeks because he\u0027ll go crawling back to her, begging her to like him again because it\u0027s oh, so important to him that she still considers him her friend when she\u0027s actually disgusted by him. He\u0027ll never get the message! He\u0027ll never understand that you -\"\\n\\n \"Shut the fuck up,\" Jazz interrupts her, his voice frighteningly deep and stern. Where screaming hasn\u0027t helped, this does, only it just works for him.\\n\\n Instead of getting in his face she rounds on me, then shoves me in the chest, hard, making me stumble out of her way more from surprise than actual force.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re such a fucking asshole!\" she shouts at me, then grabs her purse and coat, shoves her shoes on and storms out, slamming the door behind her with a loud bang.\\n\\n Puzzled by her exit I turn back to Jazz, trying to ask him what that was all about, but find him staring at me with something close to malice on his face.\\n\\n \"You know what, Edward? She\u0027s right. You are a fucking asshole.\"\\n\\n Chapter 33\\n\\n For a moment I don\u0027t know what I should feel more – pissed off or hurt –\\n\\n but I find myself mostly confused. It\u0027s nothing new for Bella to get in my face like that; I know she deals with her frustration by letting her emotions run rampant, and I prefer that to her brooding and moping around for ages, but this obviously goes beyond any other fight we\u0027ve had lately. And being left standing in my living room with Jazz, who is seething with anger, while I have absolutely no idea what is going on, is not helping things.\\n\\n \"What the fuck?\"\\n\\n Probably not the most eloquent way to phrase the question, but I don\u0027t think anything else will get through to him right now.\\n\\n Jazz keeps staring at me for several seconds, then grunts, and turns away from me, still tense as hell.\\n\\n \"Nothing. Forget it.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean, nothing?\" I shout, my own ire rising at the way he\u0027s trying to shut me down. \"Obviously I\u0027m an oblivious asshole that doesn\u0027t\\n\\n \"get\" anything. You could at least do me the courtesy of telling me what I was too dense to \"get\" this time!\"\\n\\n He stops, then looks back at me, flexing his hands as if he is yearning to punch me. Hell, maybe he is. I don\u0027t give a shit.\\n\\n \"Well?\" I ask again when he still doesn\u0027t say anything.\\n\\n \"You really don\u0027t see it?\" he asks, more incredulous than angry for a moment, but the rage is back within moments. \"How can you not see it?\\n\\n She saw it weeks ago! Weeks!\" Jazz throws his hands up and starts to pace, then stops again, glaring at me. \"How can you be so blind?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe because I\u0027m just a stupid fucker?\" I supply unhelpfully, but his anger is so contagious that I can\u0027t calm myself down. I\u0027m so fed up with all the secrecy, and I know it\u0027s only going to get worse if I don\u0027t stop this now.\\n\\n \"But how about for a change you just tell me what the fuck is going on?\\n\\n Instead of whining behind my back that I\u0027m too much of an idiot to get it?\"\\n\\n He takes an almost menacing step towards me, then opens his mouth, but at the last second closes it again. My patience snaps and I cross the distance between us, grabbing the front of his t-shirt to yank him towards me so I can sneer into his face from up close.\\n\\n \"Fucking tell me!\"\\n\\n \"I love you, that\u0027s what\u0027s going on!\"\\n\\n He spits out the words, then shoves me away, hard enough to make me stumble and for him to shake me off. Once the meaning behind what he has just said registers, I\u0027m stunned, and unable to react. I feel like a fish out of water, and my mind kicks into overdrive.\\n\\n He loves me. He loves me? What the -\\n\\n I swallow thickly, then force myself to think; all the while Jazz is staring at me, his shoulders heaving slightly with each shaky breath.\\n\\n Part of me is waiting for me to freak out – what will happen now? How will Bella take it? Can our relationship survive me fucking up again, in exactly the same way as before? But the only thing I actually feel is relief. Because suddenly it all makes sense.\\n\\n From the end of their spat it\u0027s obvious that Bella knows, in fact has known for a while – and that also explains her erratic behavior of the last few weeks. She\u0027s not one to keep secrets, and it must have been eating her up not to breathe a word to me. The fact that she didn\u0027t tell me leads me to only one possible conclusion – not only did she bow to what must have been extensive begging on Jasper\u0027s side, but she must be sympathizing deeply with him without being upset herself, or else she would have gotten in my face the second she got a whiff of it.\\n\\n And Jazz\u0027s own erratic behavior is clearly related to what just culminated to what must have been one of the hardest things he has ever admitted to anyone in his life. From the way he\u0027s still looking at me, with panic and defiance warring in his eyes, it\u0027s not hard to guess that he\u0027s expecting me to either laugh in his face, tell him to fuck off, or kick him out at any moment now.\\n\\n I should probably tell him that I don\u0027t intend to do any of those things.\\n\\n Though brief to me, my silence must have been endless to him, and he looks ready to draw his own conclusions from it.\\n\\n \"Aren\u0027t you at least going to say something to that?\" he gripes, his voice strained, his anger not completely gone.\\n\\n I spend a fleeting second trying to come up with something, but nothing comes to mind. I just know how his words make me feel.\\n\\n He hasn\u0027t shoved me far enough away that I can\u0027t cross the distance between us in two quick steps, but he tries to fight me when I grab his shoulders and pull him close. He seems so fragile as he stares at me, then opens his mouth to keep shouting, but I cut off the escaping sound by mashing my lips against his and pushing my tongue into his mouth.\\n\\n Jazz shudders, then tries to push me away in earnest, but I only let go of his left shoulder so I can grab the back of his neck to keep him from dislodging my lips from his. The muffled grunt he utters in protest already speaks of his defeat, and a moment later I feel his hands on my body. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beautiful-disaster-beautiful-1/page-55.html","bookId":2786,"book":{"id":2786,"title":"Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful #1)","description":"Storyline: Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful #1) \\n INTENSE.
