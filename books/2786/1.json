{"id":88840,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Chapter 1\n I close my eyes as I sag against the wall of the elevator, the light ding drowned out by my sigh of relief.\n Finally home.\n All I want to do now is kiss my beautiful girl, grab something to eat, and take a long hot shower. Or maybe a bath, with Bella. Just snuggle together, relax, let this fucking long day come to a slow, sweet end.\n I only open my eyes after the elevator comes to a stop at the top floor, where I shuffle over to the door on the right of the short hallway. I\u0027m sure that our nosy neighbor is watching me again, but what can I say, I really don\u0027t care. The walls are sound proof, the windows mirrored, if that old hag gets off on keeping track how often we come and go, I\u0027ll be the last one to get in her face. After all, we\u0027re just a young couple, happily in love, and have nothing to hide.\n I laugh softly to myself as I get my keys out and let myself in.\n If only she knew.\n Still grinning I kick my shoes off, dump my messenger bag on the floor in the entryway, and hang my jacket into the closet before I make a beeline for the fridge. I\u0027m starving, and I\u0027m thirsty, and while I long to find out if Bella is home already, I need to fulfill my primal needs first before we end up in a tumble of sweaty limbs on the lime green flokati rug in front of the fireplace. Although actually making sweet love to my girl on the rug sounds like a really good idea. We can always take that bath another day.\n Quickly making sure that Bella isn\u0027t anywhere in sight I take a deep draft from the OJ, smirking at myself that she has already domesticated me to the point where I feel bad about drinking straight from the carton. Not that she doesn\u0027t do it herself when she thinks I\u0027m not watching, mind you, but for some weird reason we both fall into the habit of playing house when we\u0027re in the kitchen. Behaving ourselves. Being all proper and nice.\n I make a mental note that I dearly need to fuck my girl on the kitchen counter before the weekend. Five weeks since we moved in, and still the kitchen remains undefiled. Can\u0027t have that.\n I\u0027m lucky and find there\u0027s a microwave dish with some leftovers from yesterday. Not bothering to heat the food, I wolf down half of the contents of the container before I grab a can of Coke, relishing the prickling sensation on my tongue as I take a sip.\n I\u0027m just about to close the fridge when I notice a folded sheet of paper taped to the door. Continuing to ravage the food, I pick it up and open it on the counter, idly chewing and swallowing as I stare at the brief note.\n I\u0027m waiting for you. Upstairs.\n My appetite quickly recedes, or rather redirects itself. No longer hungry for food I set the dish back in the fridge, and quickly gulp down my soda. Can\u0027t make Bella wait, after all.\n As I hurry up the stairs I wonder where she\u0027s waiting for me. Only two choices really, the bedroom or the playroom. Right or left. As I round the bend in the staircase I see the bedroom door wide open, and for a moment I\u0027m nearly disappointed. Not that I mind some nice \u0027nilla loving, but why would she leave me a note for that?\n As I\u0027m just about to enter the bedroom I see light flicker over the white wall, and as I turn slowly, I realize that the playroom door is open, just a sliver. A smile spreads on my face as I peek inside, my cock already stirring.\n And there she is, my beautiful Bella, kneeling on the pillow on the floor, her back to me. She is completely naked, of course, her mahogany hair cascading down over one shoulder as her head is bent. Around her are four huge white pillar candles, casting the otherwise empty playroom into a warm light.\n My cock gets almost painfully hard, but I will my boner to subside. Not that that helps much, seeing her like this, but I can\u0027t exactly follow my urges and just take her right there and fuck her until she comes screaming on my cock. As enticing as the view might be, I get the message she\u0027s left for me with the setup.\n For one, she wants to play, not just fuck. I\u0027m also sure that she chose the candles for a reason, or else she would just have put the lights on dim.\n That, and we have been talking a lot about trying something new for her, but I haven\u0027t gotten down to actually doing anything yet as our schedule has been all screwed up this week. But now that we have the evening to ourselves, Bella clearly has other plans than spend it snuggling in front of the TV.\n I slowly step away from the door, trying not to make any additional noise as I go into the bathroom adjacent to our bedroom and quickly undress. She must have heard me blundering around the condo, but I can at least try to be stealthy now. For a moment I consider whacking off in the shower to take care of my hard-on, but the fact of the matter is that I am tired.\n Ice cold shower it is then.\n Five minutes later I\u0027m feeling vaguely human again after a vigorous rub-down with the soft new towels. I even consider just going all naked, but I know how much Bella loves the leather pants, and I\u0027m doing this as much for her as for myself. So I quickly put them on, having to jump up and down a few times to make them sit well. The downside of being with a girl who can cook amazingly well – either I run another ten miles a week, or I start cutting back on the candy. Or fast food. Can\u0027t have that, so more running it will have to be.\n As I pad across the hallway and step up to the playroom door I try to come up with a plan. My gaze falls on the scented candles that are stored in the closet next to the bedroom. Of course I can\u0027t use them for a scene, but some extra light is always good, and the heady scent of vanilla and sandalwood can create a good atmosphere. Bella is being forward, and I feel I need to reward her for being so brave. Might as well make sure it\u0027s going to be a real night to remember for her, and not just because she stepped up to confront one of her more irrational fears.\n Picking up two of the huge cube candles with the many wicks I take them with me as I enter the playroom. Bella hasn\u0027t moved, and while her head is still bent and her eyes cast down, I\u0027m sure she\u0027s following my every move with eagerness.\n I place the candles left and right of her, outside of the square the other candles are set up in, and light them, brightening the room. The mirrored walls only add to the effect, and I take a moment to drink in her divine body.\n Exercising regularly has done a lot to improve her slim but well proportioned build, as does the yoga for her balance. Her thighs and belly are firm now, the muscles in her arms and legs slightly defined, and she can hold position a lot longer now than when we started. Not that I ever minded a little softness, on the contrary, but I know that she needs the strength and stamina for what we do. Also, going for a run together has become one of my favorite things to do with Bella, including a nice, long shower afterwards, and the occasional blowjob behind a convenient tree.\n I\u0027m tempted to fuss around with something just to annoy her a little, but I don\u0027t really feel like taking my time. I\u0027m just as eager as she must be, and I really want to get down to business. So I reach for the soft, white silk ropes, the only other thing I will be needing tonight, and return to where Bella is kneeling on the floor. Picking up the pillar candles I position them closer so that I can reach them without getting up again before I kneel down behind her.\n She doesn\u0027t move when I reach around her and run my hand over her thigh from her knee up, squeezing gently. I kiss her shoulder, then suck hard on the soft spot at the side of her neck that I know drives her crazy, and she only shivers a little. Good girl, knows it\u0027s not her place to react until I show her that I want her to.\n Sucking turns to licking, then I kiss her warm skin until I feel goose bumps marching down her leg. She still hasn\u0027t moved, but I can tell that keeping still is killing her.\n “Good evening, my little vixen. How thoughtful of you to wait like this for your Master,” I purr into her ear, watching in the mirror as she catches her bottom lip between her teeth and bites down to stifle a low moan. “Don\u0027t you want to wish me a good evening, too?”\n She raises her head and catches my gaze over the mirror, then turns her face to me so that our noses nearly brush. Her eyes are wide and dark in the twilight of the room, lust and anticipation clouding them.\n “Good evening, Sir.”\n Her luscious lips remain slightly parted when she falls silent, and I take the invitation, brushing mine over them lightly before I grab her hair hard and pull her head back. She gasps, effectively opening her mouth, and I kiss her more roughly, plunging my tongue inside, taking, exploring. Bella moans again, this time loudly, making me grin as I pull back, my hand still grasping her soft locks.\n “I really appreciate your openness,” I tell her, my eyes boring into hers intently. “But I\u0027m not going to fuck you tonight.” She remains impassive, already too used to the way I play my games.\n Months ago a look of disappointment would have crossed her features, but now she just remains calm, waiting. I smile, which is probably more a hungry leer, before I go on.\n “Unless you\u0027re a good little slut and earn it.”\n I know that she doesn\u0027t really get off on the name calling, but it\u0027s one of the few compromises we’ve made. Bella knows that I don\u0027t exactly mean it in a degrading way, it\u0027s part of the game for me, and as such she appreciates it.\n I think it\u0027s one of the last vestiges of her moral high ground that I keep tearing down, her way of being reluctant to fully succumb to me. I respect that, although I don\u0027t necessarily like her view. But we all have something that simply rubs us the wrong way, and as long as we can make it work, I won\u0027t push her. Too much. One of these days we will have to have another of those \u0027I don\u0027t really get why you\u0027re holding on to your former self\u0027 talks, but as it is, I\u0027m damn excited she\u0027s willing to push her physical limits. And we have time, no need to jump the gun.\n Bella\u0027s pant draws me back into the here and now, and I let go of her hair as I have made my point.\n “You want that, though, don\u0027t you? You want to be fucked.”\n “Yes, Sir.”\n My cock twitches in my pants, and I quickly think of something unpleasant to dampen the effect her whispered words have on me. Nothing gets me like her being in full on submissive mode. I nudge her chin with my nose, signaling her to straighten up again and look forward instead of at me, and she quickly complies, a smile playing across the corners of her mouth.\n When she\u0027s still again, I put both my hands at her hips, then bring them up over her flat stomach to cup her breasts. Her nipples are hard already from her being naked for so long, but also from excitement, and I idly pluck on them before I grab her tits hard, squeezing. Her breath hitches for a moment, but she doesn\u0027t tense up, instead relaxes further. I keep playing with her nipples, rolling them between my fingers while I watch her in the mirror.\n I shift my grip a little, and let my right hand drift lower, down to her hip again. She eagerly spreads her legs wider, and I smirk as I cup her sex with my hand. A quick swipe with my finger around her entrance reveals just how wet she already is, wet and ready for me. I gather some of her juices and run my fingers between her pussy lips until I reach her clit. A soft moan escapes her as I circle it, quickly cutting off when I instead pinch her labia hard, repeatedly. Even though she tenses up now I know she likes it, as her hips are still pushed towards my hand, not ever bucking away to evade me.\n I let go of her again and place another soft kiss onto the side of her neck, a sweet and unnecessary reminder of why I\u0027m doing this. Then I lean back and reach for the ropes, quickly getting to work.\n Starting with her wrists, I draw her arms back until her elbows touch and bind them together, using a different rope for her wrists so I can keep them restrained even when I undo the other knots. Bella instinctively tilts her torso back more until her knuckles reach the floor, stabilizing herself so I can move on. A tie in her hair keeps her tresses in check and forces her to hold her head high, giving me better access to her delicious body.\n It would have been easier for me to bind her arms at the end as now I have to fumble as I bring the longer rope several times around her torso, back and forth above and below her breasts, before I grab her tits and wind more rope tightly around each full globe. Bella whimpers a little at the unfamiliar feeling as she\u0027s used to me going for less restrictive breast bondage normally, but I want her tits sensitive, yearning to be touched. A few more knots and I\u0027m done, leaving her tits constricted at the base and sticking out from her body invitingly.\n I move to her thighs next and bind her ankles to them, rendering her helpless that way. A few more loops around her waist follow, and I bring the last length of rope from above her belly button between her pussy lips, and tie it to the waist ropes in back. I check all the knots, they are tight and the ropes bite into her flesh, but for the limited time I\u0027m planning to leave them in place that\u0027s okay.\n My focus shifts to the rise and fall of her chest – she is clearly excited, but I decide I need to let her stew a little longer. Instead of reaching for the candles like she probably expects, I run my fingers softly over her body, her thighs, her stomach, her arms, barely skimming her breasts, while I kiss her neck gently. I can feel her body respond, her pulse picks up, and the calm and serene demeanor leaves her. She leans further towards me but I stay out of her reach, just close enough so she can feel my body heat, but I don\u0027t allow her to touch me. Yet.\n The soft caresses and kisses drive her wild, and when I run my fingers down the crotch rope, they come away soaked. I\u0027d say she is ready to step up the pace.\n Bella\u0027s eyes open fully as she feels me withdraw, and her breath leaves in a loud rush as she watches me pick up the first candle. I\u0027ve tested them before, until I come really close to her body I can\u0027t really hurt her with the wax, nothing she can\u0027t take. I still direct a most wicked grin at her that makes her shiver, then bring my free hand around her hips to make sure that she can\u0027t buck away too much and destroy my aim.\n Her muscles tense up all over her body as she stares at the flame, her lip again caught between her teeth as she tries to remain calm. I blow over the wet spot on her neck until she is shaking, distracting her until I suddenly tilt the candle and splash a few drops of wax onto her chest. They all hit her just above the ropes where I know they don\u0027t really hurt her, and after a shudder Bella stills again, slightly less tense.\n The next drops I aim at her right breast, hitting the fleshy part that is constricted by the silk ropes. A slight whimper leaves her, but that\u0027s it, so I move to the left, bringing my aim a little closer to her nipple, but still staying away. Somewhat shy at first, she soon pushes her shoulders further back, the motion putting her breasts even more on display. I keep up my game until there is only a little wax left in the pool around the wick. I stop and smirk at her, waiting until her eyes widen in light apprehension, before I dribble the rest onto her hard nipples.\n The hiss that escapes her goes right to my dick, making it twitch and strain against the leather pants. I watch intently as Bella fights the pain, but the glassy look in her eyes together with the sudden deep blush on her cheeks tells me that my girl is enjoying herself alright. I wait until the wax is mostly cooled before I grab her nipples between my thumbs and forefingers, squeezing and rolling until all the wax has peeled off, and she is moaning with need. My lips find hers and I kiss her hungrily, sliding my tongue against hers as I keep mauling her tits.\n Bella stills again as I pick up the second candle, but her eyes remain hooded with lust even when I drip more wax onto her sensitive nipples. She barely moves away now so I let the hand that doesn\u0027t hold the candle roam lower until I reach her pussy. She\u0027s even wetter now, and I can\u0027t hide a satisfied smile. I start rubbing the rope over her clit until she bucks her hips against my hand, a few needy sounds leaving her – and then I spill nearly the whole pooled wax over her left breast and down her belly where it gets held up by the rope around her waist.\n Her eyes go wide and she shouts “fuck!” as I take her completely by surprise. I barely give her body time to recuperate as I snatch the next candle up and do the same to her other side. Her whole body shakes as the hot wax cascades over her sensitive tit, but her moan is needy and loud, before I stifle it with my hungry mouth. Her hips jerk as I rub her harder, telling of her need to get more friction where she needs it.\n I turn my head away from hers and trail my fingers up to her stomach, but she doesn\u0027t protest, just sags against me as I scoot a little closer. I love the sight of the now hardened wax on her body, but I resist the urge to peel it off from anywhere but her nipples. Bella glances down at my fingers freeing her swollen and sensitive nubs again, and for a moment a stubborn set comes to her jaw.\n Inwardly amused by her evident battle to keep her resentment at what I\u0027m doing to herself, I stop and grab her chin, forcing her to turn her head and look at me. Defiance lights up her already expressive eyes, making me forget for a moment what I wanted to do to her other than ravage her mouth and fuck her hard.\n “Bella, Bella, do we have to work on your appreciation for what I do to you, again?” I taunt her with a hard edge to my voice.\n Her eyes widen and she grows slightly pale underneath the flush of excitement, and I can tell that she\u0027s thinking hard for a moment whether she has done anything wrong. Of course she hadn\u0027t, and when she comes to the same conclusion, she relaxes slightly.\n “No, Sir.”\n “Are you sure? You just seemed a little, how shall I phrase it, ungrateful for all the attention I bestow upon your lovely body?” She\u0027s fighting a grin at my playful tone and weird phrasing, and that ultimately breaks the spell. I smile as I feel her relax against me, and lust replaces the apprehension on her face.\n “I\u0027m sure, Sir. Whatever you choose to do to me, I\u0027m yours.” She closes her eyes as she leans further into me, but I\u0027m having none of that.\n “Open your eyes. I want you to watch what I\u0027m doing to you.” Her lids flutter before she looks at me, a light smile gracing those sensuous lips. I break eye contact then and concentrate on her body instead. I love touching her like this, when she\u0027s helpless and can\u0027t evade me. She\u0027s so responsive, arching into my hands as small sounds escape her. I gently stroke her wax covered tits before I twist her nipples hard, returning to soft touches as she shudders from the twin spikes of pain. I attack her neck again, tease her relentlessly with my tongue and lips while I grab her breasts hard. Wax cracks and peels off in places while she moans, calling to my cock. I could do this forever, but very likely I\u0027d go insane before long.\n A last check at her pussy, and I know she\u0027s as ready as she gets. Bella sighs as I let go of her and reach for the last candle, her eyes seeking out mine. Whatever she sees there makes her relax further against me. She keeps looking at my face a moment longer before she turns her head to follow the path of the candle over her body. My hand is back between her legs, only that now I\u0027m reaching lower. She thrusts her hips hard when I part the twin ropes over her crotch just enough so that I can tease the entrance of her pussy, but keep the full friction over her clit. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beautiful-disaster-beautiful-1/page-1.html","bookId":2786,"book":{"id":2786,"title":"Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful #1) \n INTENSE.
