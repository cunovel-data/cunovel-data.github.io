{"id":88878,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"As much as I\u0027m dreading what\u0027s to come listening to their exchange is incredibly amusing, and I have to actively wipe the mirth off my face when the door finally creaks open. Hiding the last of my somewhat wry grin behind the coffee mug I watch as Jazz enters, eyeing Bella warily over his shoulder the whole time. She takes a moment to stare at me balefully before she reaches for the door.\n \"Don\u0027t even think of coming out of there until you\u0027re done. Unless you need an ambulance, but then you can just holler down to where I\u0027ll be waiting in the living room.\"\n Then she slams the door shut, the sound as ominous as her words. Jazz keeps staring at the closed door for a few seconds longer before he turns to me, clearly unwilling to catch my gaze but not backing down, either. I have no idea whether I\u0027m glaring at him or not as my mind is completely wiped clean of any thought or emotion, and finally he harrumphs.\n \"Look, I really didn\u0027t know you were going at it just now, hell, I didn\u0027t even know you were there, Bella said you\u0027ll probably have to stay at the hospital until late, and -\"\n \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s the point of this conversation right now,\" I interrupt him, a little surprised just how neutral I\u0027m sounding.\n Jazz blinks, then clears his throat again.\n \"Guess not. But it\u0027s a start to try to explain that I\u0027m not out to break the two of you up with my most malicious schemes, or some shit like that. Because I\u0027m not. And there are no schemes.\"\n Seeing him ramble nervously like that strangely eases me, and while neither the anger nor frustration go away, I feel a little less apprehensive about this.\n \"Just tell me what Bella thinks I need to hear. Because clearly the Cerberus huffing in the living room downstairs won\u0027t let either of us out of here if we don\u0027t get this over with.\"\n \"Easier said than done,\" he retorts.\n \"Always is.\"\n Jazz falls silent for a moment, then leans back against the wall next to the towel rack, probably in an attempt to either look casual or assume a more comfortable position, but tensed up as he is it doesn\u0027t seem he achieves either. I take another sip from my coffee before I sit down on the counter, not exactly coincidentally where I\u0027ve last fucked Bella without the universe trying to spoil our fun.\n \"So,\" he starts, but then doesn\u0027t go on, momentarily lost in studying the tiles on the floor. I let him stew for a while until my patience is threatening to disappear with the last bit of coffee.\n \"So?\"\n He finally looks up at me again and swallows thickly, and if it wasn\u0027t such an awkward moment, the way he\u0027s visibly trying to steel himself might have actually been rather amusing.\n \"So I think I should probably start by saying that I\u0027m sorry. For what I did, back in spring, not that I think it\u0027s hard to guess anyway what I\u0027m talking about. And I really am, but honestly, I think it would just sound phony and fake if I said it right now. Guess I should instead start with how I got to actually really be sorry for my actions.\"\n I have to admit, he sounds both more sincere than I expect, and is more honest than I\u0027ve ever thought possible.\n \"Start with whatever you want. I\u0027m not going to interrupt you.\" And I really don\u0027t intend to, unless he gives me a real reason to punch him beyond those I already have. He seems to take my words for the shaky truce they are, and nods.\n \"Fair enough.\"\n His eyes briefly snag away as if to resume the doubtlessly fascinating study of the tiles, but then he forces himself to catch my gaze again while he starts talking.\n \"Alice made me go to therapy.\"\n He leaves the words hanging between us for a moment, and when I don\u0027t add anything, he goes on.\n \"One day in early summer she handed me this business card of this\n \u0027fabulous shrink\u0027,\" he adds the air quotes with his fingers, \"and pretty much told me to go see her. Sheila Cooper, sex educator and family therapist. I had a pretty hard time not laughing at first, then asked her if she thought that we needed counseling already, but Alice replied that it wasn\u0027t for us, just for me. She thought I needed to talk to someone about my promiscuous habits, and that if I really loved her, I would just do it. So I did it, ignoring the usual emotional blackmail, called and made an appointment, trying very hard not to sound as amused as I was.\n \"First time I went there, Alice came with me, then kissed me good-bye outside the building and told me she would be waiting for me in the café downstairs. I have to admit, if she hadn\u0027t been there I might never have gone inside. But I did, telling myself to just do this, tell that stuck up shrew I expected this Dr. Cooper to be whatever she wanted to hear, and be done with it.\"\n He pauses here, but I don\u0027t add the comment that shrinks are qualified personnel, too that he clearly thinks I need to offer.\n \"Anyway, Sheila turned out to be very different from my expectations.\n Younger, more attractive, a very keen eye for bullshit and no tolerance whatsoever for the same. I tried to work my charm on her for maybe five minutes, after which she shot me down hard. Then she asked me why I was here for real, and I bluntly told her that my girlfriend wanted me to see a shrink, but I didn\u0027t think that there were any issues to work on. Then I nearly fell over myself explaining that the no issues comment wasn\u0027t just avoidance or defensiveness or something, and she let me talk myself into deeper shit still for another five minutes. All without uttering a single word, and by then I was ready to tell her my life story.\n \"But all she finally said was, \u0027Okay, be that as it may, you don\u0027t have to convince me, just pay cash up front and we\u0027re done here.\u0027 I was so surprised that I didn\u0027t know what to say, clearly her ploy, and then she went on offering that maybe I might like to use this one time opportunity to just talk to a professional who wouldn\u0027t judge anything I said if I was already here.\n \"At first I really didn\u0027t want to, but she kept looking at me, so finally I explained again that I didn\u0027t think I needed to talk about anything. She asked why exactly my girlfriend wanted me to see her, so I replied that she thought I had been a little too easy with the ladies, which I didn\u0027t even deny, but she didn\u0027t know all the reasons, which if she did would have made this visit obsolete.\n \"\u0027Shouldn\u0027t you tell her those reasons then? Honesty is important in a relationship, particularly if one partner feels insecure about something,\u0027 she asked, to what I replied, \u0027Well, the real reason why I fucked every available nice piece of ass is because I was waiting for her to realize she only wanted me after getting to see more of the world, or more cocks, whichever comes first.\u0027\n \"I got a raised brow for that, then a succinct, \u0027There\u0027s a circle in hell reserved for people who feel cocky about lying to their therapists, you know?\u0027 which made me laugh. I told her it was still true, and the fact that I felt like I had something to prove to myself for a while after the accident that left me incapable of jerking off for half a year alone, and after that it just kind of got a habit, being the rebound guy. To which she, \u0027Rebound guy?\u0027, and I, \u0027Yes, you know, the guy women pick up in a bar when they\u0027re still all torn up about the asshole who just left them, then have great sex with for one night, a week, or maybe even a month, and after that they move on because it was just sex. No harm done, fun for everyone involved, don\u0027t see that there\u0027s a problem.\u0027\n \"I kind of expected her to at least be appalled, you know, the kind of most women get at that, but she just shrugged and said, all cool, \u0027So how does that make you feel, no longer being a manwhore?\u0027 I was really surprised at that, although I already started to wonder why, and asked her if she was like that to all of her clients. She shrugged and explained that it was her job to be what her clients needed – lending calm comfort and understanding for a nervous mother who just found out her child was gay and was simply too confused herself how to handle the situation well as a supportive parent; a strong sounding board for the cheated upon wife who was trying to get on with her life – but as she didn\u0027t get the sense that I required either, why should she keep up that pretense?\n \"She obviously had a point, so I told her that I didn\u0027t mind not sleeping with three different women in a week, and I was very happy with Alice. And added that I found it rather funny that she called me a manwhore as my best friend used to do that all the time.\n \"\u0027So he did?\u0027 she wanted to know, in that typical way shrinks do. Had to correct her there - \u0027She, actually, my best friend\u0027s a girl.\u0027 I clarified. She nodded sagely at that and gave me one of those condescending looks, of course I had to set things straight. \u0027She\u0027s not a booty call. I mean, yeah, we had sex, but not like that. And it wasn\u0027t just her and me, but her, me, and her boyfriend. Who\u0027s been my roomie since college.\u0027\n \"Of course then she wanted to know if my girlfriend knew you both. To which I, \u0027He\u0027s her best friend.\u0027 You should have seen that smirk she then put on. \u0027How long ago was that? The last time you had sex with them,\u0027 she wanted to know. Calculating quickly, I, \u0027Maybe three months ago?\u0027\n \"\u0027Might be a lucky guess, but could it be that this is the real reason you\u0027re here?\u0027 was her succinct retort. And not much I could say about that, right? I kind of gave her credit for weaseling that out of me as she did, so I figured, what the heck, before I ramble on about some random girls I don\u0027t even know the names of anymore, why not talk about that? It\u0027s not like I could say anything to Alice after she called the topic discussed enough.\n \"The weird thing, or guess professional side about her was that she didn\u0027t seem curious. Just someone who would listen. It was a bit unnerving at first, but then she started asking a few questions, so I told her how I met Bella when I moved with my family up North. How I met you in college.\n More like random stuff then, really, until she asked how we got to have sex.\"\n He pauses there, and I can tell that my utter lack of reaction is unnerving him, but not much to say about that. It feels strange listening to him recount our past like that with a nearly clinical detachment, then again I have no idea how often he has told the same tale already.\n \"So I told her the whole story about that weekend. How I\u0027d met Jessica Stanley at the liquor store and she asked me how Bella was doing, and I was all, \u0027Why shouldn\u0027t she be doing great?\u0027, and that skank told me that Bells had walked in on her and that other hussy with Mike. That clearly surprised the good doc.\n \"\u0027Your incentive to have a threesome with your two best friends was one of them getting cheated on by their significant other having a threesome with someone else?\u0027\n \"\u0027The thought crossed my mind,\u0027 I told her, but then had to explain why things where completely different, too. \u0027You have to know, my roommate, Edward, he had been carrying a torch for Bella for ages. Botched more than one attempt to tell her, too, and when she then hooked up with that loser, he was all \u0027Boohoo, I should have told her!\u0027, and obviously now was a good time to remedy that all.\n \"I then went on explaining, \u0027When I got home I didn\u0027t right away tell Edward, because I knew if I did that I\u0027d have to go post bail later that day after he was done beating Mike to a bloody pulp. And I figured Bella would tell me herself when she was ready. Although judging from the way she stumbled around, lost and disheveled when she came over I knew she was done wallowing alone. So I grabbed Edward and told him. Of course he was, like me, ready to show Mike in detail what we thought of him, but before he could launch into any plans of vengeance I pointed out that he had something better to do. At first he was all, \u0027What the hell are you talking about?\u0027 but when I pointed out that now the day he had been praying for had arrived he got a little defensive, all \u0027And getting her drunk enough so she won\u0027t really remember if we fucked or not is your answer to that?\u0027 He can be a little slow at times, brilliant as he is when it comes to brainy things.\u0027\n \"I told him to stop being such a moron, but getting her drunk wasn\u0027t the worst idea as it was the ideal out if for whatever reason his pining should not be requited. Ever observant Sheila then asked me why I figured that was such a big deal, and of course I had to tell her just what you do behind closed doors and otherwise.\"\n Although I try to keep a straight face I must have grimaced at that as Jazz snorts.\n \"I told her that you\u0027re into kinky stuff. Whereas she raised a brow and asked me how I defined kinky, and I replied that you\u0027d likely have my ass for colloquialisms like that, so clarified, \u0027He\u0027s into BDSM, all the way, takes it serious and all.\u0027 And I also added that while I didn\u0027t think it was Bella\u0027s thing, a little experimenting hadn\u0027t hurt anyone ever, but what did I know, maybe you had picked up on something I just didn\u0027t want to see. In hindsight it\u0027s always easier to see things like that.\"\n When I don\u0027t react to his words yet again, Jazz sighs and goes on.\n \"Anyway, I could see she wanted to ask my opinion on the whole subject but instead went on with my recount.\n \"\u0027After a little more needling I finally had him far enough to say something to her. I mean, the worst thing that could happen was either her taking him seriously but being turned off, but they were always so close and comfortable around each other that I couldn\u0027t imagine more than a few awkward days to come from that. Plus, she could always pretend she had just imagined that offer if she was at least tipsy by then. Second option, she doesn\u0027t take him serious and laughs her ass off – bad for his ego, but the way she was looking I couldn\u0027t imagine he would mind that much if it raised her spirits some. But more likely was what really happened – he told her straight out what he did, asked her if she wanted to try – and one look at her face and I knew he had her. Of course them being them they couldn\u0027t just seal the deal then, they had to spend the whole night avoiding each other while so obviously wanting the exact same thing, but they can be a little slow at times.\n \"\u0027Later, after she went home he was all, \u0027Oh noes, she\u0027ll never say yes!\u0027 but I didn\u0027t even get to tell him to stop moping because right that moment she called, and, guess what, of course she was interested. One would have thought that he would have been excited about this, but no, he got all anxious, started babbling about how he didn\u0027t want to scare her and stuff, at which point I joked that if he felt he needed a wingman, he\u0027d just have to ask. I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d really take me up on that, I mean, come on, the girl he\u0027d been wanting for the last five years and now he has a real shot at it?\n But he reasoned that she\u0027d probably be more at ease as she\u0027d never take me that serious as him, us being friends forever and all, so me sticking around might actually help her relax. I had to admit, she\u0027s a fine piece of ass so of course I didn\u0027t say no, and we agreed that either way, if this really was just a one-time thing, at least she\u0027d get the most out of it.\u0027\"\n He stops there again, probably because I\u0027m frowning for real, and when he keeps looking at me questioningly I grunt.\n \"I really wasn\u0027t that whiny.\"\n \"True, not verbatim, but seriously, I\u0027ve seldom seen you that out of your league. I\u0027m still amazed that she didn\u0027t even get a whiff of that.\"\n I don\u0027t reply, and when he realizes that I won\u0027t offer anything else, he resumes talking instead.\n \"I didn\u0027t really go into details about it, except telling Sheila that we all had fun, that I think we all got the most out of it, and that I was glad that afterwards you had your most meaningful confession of mutual love so that finally this whole pining was over. I also added that Bells and I didn\u0027t really have anything except maybe an awkward two minutes around each other, so it was all good, perfect match made in heaven.\n \"After that the doc was silent for a few moments, then offered, \u0027I presume that sooner or later your girlfriend learned about this?\u0027 Of course no sense denying it. \u0027She did. But she\u0027s okay with it now, because she knows that it\u0027s a thing of the past and won\u0027t happen again.\u0027\n \"Of course she doubted that, so I explained that it really was a one-way road as neither of you\u0027d ever want to have sex with me again.\n \"She, of course, \u0027And what has you so convinced about that? From what you told me about them they might be the kind of decent people who respect others being off-limit due to the exclusivity of some relationships, but sometimes that doesn\u0027t prevent the heart from wanting something else than the mind dictates.\u0027\n \"She was perplexed when I laughed and told her that for that to happen both of you would first have to stop being royally pissed at me.\n \"\u0027See, Alice is the type of woman who loves to be shown how important she is to you. So I figured I needed some kind of gesture to show her that I really wanted her, above all else.\u0027\n \"She to that, \u0027Sounds ominous.\u0027\n \"Me, \u0027Well, I guess seducing a girl\u0027s boyfriend so she can walk in on you, then get angry enough to kick you out and tell you to fuck off, at which point you of course have to turn to your true love for her help and play the sympathy card along with the \u0027you\u0027re all I ever wanted\u0027 angle usually does the trick. Or so I thought.\u0027\n \"There she wisely assumed that things didn\u0027t go according to plan. I was still pretty relaxed about the whole issue, all, \u0027Well, in the end it worked.\n Just the fallout was a little more dramatic than anyone could have expected. But I\u0027m sure they\u0027ll get over it eventually.\u0027\"\n I couldn\u0027t help a scoff at that, and seeing the look of guilt so plain on his face eased some of the anger wanting to burst out of me.\n \"I really didn\u0027t think this could escalate like it did! I might be a manipulative asshole, but I never really thought what I did could come close to breaking you two up. I even thought I\u0027d overdone it with the talking for Bella\u0027s sake because I was so sure that she\u0027d start laughing at me any moment.\"\n \"Wait, you knew she was in the house already?\"\n For a moment a hint of a smirk appears on his face but it is gone the moment he realizes just how close I am to breaking my stoic demeanor.\n \"Yes, I knew, she wasn\u0027t exactly silent when she came in. And Alice had called me right after Bella left, so I knew that she\u0027d be home in the next thirty minutes tops.\"\n Nothing really new, but getting the confirmation of my suspicions is a lot less satisfying than one may think. I force myself to calm down as there is no sense in dwelling on that now – and I have a feeling that this is not the part he really needs to tell me, and as I won\u0027t hear the rest if I beat him to a bloody pulp now I restrain myself from even telling him just what I think of that whole move.\n \"That about concluded my first ever therapy session. Well, she did tell me that if I didn\u0027t find anything else to talk about we could always analyze why I felt the need for actions like that any day, but she didn\u0027t bug me again with it when I showed up the next week. And like this the next appointments went. I mean, I didn\u0027t really talk that much about the three of us, but about my sexual history in general. I think I surprised her when I told her that I didn\u0027t keep a black book, or that I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d slept with a three digit number of girls. I\u0027d even go so far that by the time I told her that I wasn\u0027t freaking out over admitting that I had liked my one time experimenting with another guy that I really had no need to be there except to pacify Alice. I also don\u0027t think either of us really expected that we\u0027d make any kind of progress. I just talked, she listened, but it wasn\u0027t anything I hadn\u0027t told anyone before. At least until the night the four of us went to that club, you know, where Bella had another spell of lethal foot-in-mouth disease and you ran off later?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beautiful-disaster-beautiful-1/page-39.html","bookId":2786,"book":{"id":2786,"title":"Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful #1) \n INTENSE.
