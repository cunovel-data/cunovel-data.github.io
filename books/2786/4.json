{"id":88843,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Then again the way her tongue runs over her lip pushes the exhaustion right out of my mind, and if I have to stare at the bit of fabric that she insists is called underwear, that is peeking out above the waistband of her sweats, I\u0027m going inside.\n For some reason she doesn\u0027t react when I push myself off the couch and crawl over to her, then bend my head to catch the side of the thong between my teeth. I tug until I\u0027m sure that excuse for panties must bite into her flesh on the other side, before I let go, the elastic snapping right back into her hip. When she still doesn\u0027t even flinch I repeat my approach, and end it with a wet kiss onto her soft skin.\n “Is there something you would like to tell me with that, or are you just being a pain in the ass?”\n Bella glances down at me after she closes her laptop and sets it down on the table, her eyebrows raised. I push myself closer to her so that I can rest my head on her thigh, and grin up at her.\n “Oh I\u0027d love to be a pain in your ass, shall I get the lube?” Bella rolls her eyes at me, but the way her smile lights up her face just makes me want to stay here with her like this forever.\n “Has someone told you before that your humor lacks any kind of subtlety?”\n “I think you mentioned something like that before.” She squeals when I push my face against her stomach and dab my tongue into her belly button, but she doesn\u0027t seem to mind me pulling her tank top up her chest.\n “Stop it! I still have to finish my column; I have to send it to Ben for approval first thing in the morning!”\n I mumble a string of profanities into her warm skin in between messy kisses, but stop when she pushes lightly on my shoulders.\n “Edward, I really mean it. Twenty minutes, then I\u0027m all yours, okay?” I really don\u0027t want to move, but I can\u0027t resist her when she smiles like this.\n After a last kiss on her stomach I retreat to the other end of the couch again, and try to focus on the show. I just close my eyes for a moment, but I must have dozed off, as the TV is off and the lights are dimmed when I open them again. I\u0027m instantly grumpy that my insane job has once again cost me a nice evening romp on the couch, but then I feel warm lips running over my abs and, belatedly. look down.\n During my slumber one of my legs must have slipped off the couch, and now Bella is kneeling on the floor before me, her hands on my thighs while she\u0027s kissing wet lines down my lower stomach. When she feels me stir, she briefly looks up and grins at me before she goes back to tickling me with her tongue.\n I\u0027m still wondering if I should draw her back up onto the sofa, when she reaches into my boxer briefs, and the next moment her mouth is hot and wet around my cock. I groan loudly and sink back onto the couch, my dick screaming at me not to interrupt her. Not that I intend to. Her lips and tongue just feel too good on me.\n She hums contently when I groan in bliss, which of course makes me even harder. Her hand wraps around my cock and she starts stroking me in turn with sucking, and I\u0027m in heaven. Her hair tickles my thigh and I brush it away, but my fingers remain in her soft tresses – not holding her head or anything, but just feeling the silky texture on my fingertips.\n Within minutes she has me groaning and panting in pleasure and the urge to hold her in place and fuck her mouth resurfaces but, for once, I let her set the pace and am content with enjoying myself and watching her work.\n I\u0027m used to my subs knowing how to please me that way, but the fact that Bella really enjoys fellatio is indescribable. Even now her eyes are dark with lust as she gazes up at me, before she intensifies her efforts until she wears down my restraint.\n I come in her mouth with a long drawn out moan, my orgasm that much stronger when she takes all of me in when she feels me coming, her lips sealed around the base of my cock. When I\u0027m spent she keeps licking at my head long after all the jizz is cleaned up, and for a moment, I wonder if I can get it up again soon. I\u0027m even a little disappointed when Bella pushes my dick back into my underwear, but then she\u0027s crawling onto me, and I don\u0027t really care anymore.\n My hands are at the back of her head when I draw her close to me, hungrily kissing her mouth. She tastes all like her with just a trace of my spunk and I decide that I want to spend the rest of the night just exploring her mouth.\n Bella moans against my lips contently while her fingers knead my sides, and long before I\u0027m ready to let her go, she pulls away and rests her head on my shoulder.\n “Thought that would wake you up again.”\n I laugh as I stroke her back gently.\n “You always have that effect on me.” I kiss her hair, then add, “Sorry that I fell asleep. Long day.”\n “Don\u0027t worry; at least I don\u0027t have to feel bad that my promised half hour turned out to be two hours. Plus, I love watching you sleep. You make the cutest of noises when I tickle your neck.”\n Her words make me laugh and I would smack her ass for that if I weren\u0027t so languid right now. I still feel like I should do something so I let my fingers drift lower and into the back of her sweats. That thong is really just a thin string of fabric that disappears between her ass cheeks and I bother myself with following its path for a while until I slip my fingers underneath it to caress her skin. Bella\u0027s warm breath against my neck picks up when I skim lower but, before I can reach any vital parts of her anatomy, she stretches her body, not quite incidentally knocking my arm away.\n “Don\u0027t start anything you don\u0027t intend to follow up on. I\u0027m too tired to go to bed frustrated now.”\n “Who says I\u0027m just making empty promises?”\n She laughs softly before she scoots back a little, straddling me as she sits down on my thighs close to my knees, smiling at me.\n “You were barely awake enough to enjoy me giving you a blow job; you don\u0027t seem up to fucking my ass right now.”\n I don\u0027t know if I should be offended by her words, or if she\u0027s just trying to goad me into action, but there\u0027s no fire in her eyes, so I guess she\u0027s just stating the obvious.\n “I was, but now I\u0027m awake, thanks to your very talented mouth.” Months ago she would have blushed, now she\u0027s just grinning at my praise.\n “Well, if you\u0027re that taken by my mouth, wait until you see what my pussy can do for you.”\n Of course my cock stirs at her words and I groan, and Bella chuckles at my reaction.\n “Yeah, poor Edward, really, always pestered by your nympho of a girl!” I can\u0027t let that remark slide, so I grab her and push her down onto her back on the couch, crouching over her as I sneer. She laughs, and I stifle the sound by plunging my tongue into her mouth, kissing her hard and deep until laughter turns to needy moans. My fingers dig into her hips as I hold her down, then I shift my body so I can grip the back of her neck with one hand, and push the other into her sweats.\n No surprise, she\u0027s wet and her thong is soaked, and her back arches up underneath me when I drag her panties aside and thrust two of my fingers into her. Her hands push against my shoulders, urging me off her, but I\u0027m not ready to let her go yet. So I catch her wrists with the hand that was on her neck and press them into the couch over her head, while I keep fucking her with my fingers. She\u0027s writhing underneath me now, her hips pressing against my hand, all signs of struggle gone. My thumb finds her clit, and I feel her clench around me. I speed up my efforts, and she\u0027s coming, her lips still smashed against mine.\n I withdraw my fingers from her hot pussy and move off her a little, but still keep her hands pinned. Bella is panting hard, her eyes drooping closed, but open wide as she watches me lick her juices off my fingers. I love how she tastes, and for a moment I even contemplate making her come again with just my mouth. But then I remember my talk with Beth today, and decide to postpone any further attempts to make Bella scream until later.\n She looks a little disappointed when I let go of her and lie down on the couch, but she\u0027s only too happy to shimmy around until she\u0027s partly lying on my chest. We kiss some more, but I think she feels that my heart\u0027s no longer fully into it.\n “Why do I think that the next words out of your mouth are the ominous \u0027we need to talk\u0027?”\n I laugh at the suspicion in her voice and gently kiss her again to make sure that my intentions are not driven by any sense of guilt or unease.\n “You know me too well, Swan.”\n “Oh, now we\u0027re on last name basis, gotta be something important.”\n “Depends.”\n “On what?”\n I shrug and pull her even closer, my hands back in her hair.\n “How important you want it to be.”\n “Just spit it out, Cullen, before I die of anticipation here.” I laugh as she\u0027s all relaxed against me, a warm, content body stretched alongside my own.\n “I talked to Beth today.”\n “And?”\n “And she gave me shit because I\u0027m keeping you from her and the others.\n Apparently. Not that I think I ever actively did that, but, you know.” Bella\u0027s chuckling into my chest, before she turns her head and places a gentle kiss onto my chin.\n “I\u0027m all yours, you know? And yours to keep away from anyone else.” My heart clenches at her words, and that twisted mix of melancholy and endless happiness zooms through me. Just mine, always mine, just as I\u0027m hers.\n Of course I can\u0027t go all sappy on her, even though I partly want to, but she\u0027s in a playful mood now that she\u0027s satisfied, and I don\u0027t really want her to tease me for spilling my guts.\n “Oh, you are, but wanna know what\u0027s even more fun than locking you up here and having my wicked way with you? Parading you in front of others and showing them firsthand what they are missing, and what I have every day.”\n She\u0027s silent for a moment, and I wonder what she thinks I\u0027m implying here.\n I\u0027m close to panicking when she frowns for a second, but then her forehead is smooth again, a light smile on her lips.\n “What is this all about?”\n I decide to just spill it, I can always tease her tomorrow, right now I should go easy on her if I want her to be comfortable with the idea.\n “Beth is having a play party in three weeks. Wanna go there with me?” I expect the frown to come back, but Bella\u0027s smile stays, even though she hesitates for a little while.\n “I guess.”\n “You guess? Doesn\u0027t sound too good.”\n Now she\u0027s sneering, but it\u0027s a playful sneer.\n “Seriously, you, me, a room full of people who\u0027re likely to be okay with any kind of PDA you come up with, I wonder if I\u0027ll get brain damage from blushing.”\n Her accusation makes me laugh, but I hold myself back after a moment when Bella in fact scowls at me. I bring my hands up in a defensive gesture, trying to pacify her as I mimic taking an oath.\n “I solemnly swear, I will behave myself and only grope you when you want me to.”\n “See, that\u0027s the problem!”\n “What\u0027s the problem?”\n She sighs, exasperated.\n “Edward, I always want you to grope me! Well, maybe not in front of your parents, but you know what I mean. I protest, of course, because that\u0027s what I do, but we both know that I\u0027m terribly easy to persuade that it\u0027s a good thing when you have your hand inside my pants! Oh, and that solemnly swearing I only believe when you end that sentence with \u0027I\u0027m up to no good\u0027.”\n I roll my eyes at her and grumble something under my breath about pop culture references, but she just looks too cute, all agitated from her accusation. She\u0027s right, of course, but I\u0027m trying to be good and really mean it.\n “Beth and Gerard will be there, and Peter and Charlotte, too, rest assured that I will behave myself just because one half of them would have my ass for being stupid, and the other would frown upon my improper behavior.\n After all I have a reputation to uphold, and as much as I love to tease you, I\u0027m not going to get banned from any community events just because I feel like biting your juicy ass in front of everyone.”\n For some reason my half-assed argumentation seems to work, as Bella stops frowning and snuggles closer to me.\n “Okay.”\n “Okay what?”\n “Okay, let\u0027s go to that play party. I just don\u0027t have anything to wear. And before you start, no, I\u0027m so not going naked.”\n I chuckle at her decisive tone, and earn myself a badly aimed punch in the arm for that.\n “Stop it, I really mean it! And don\u0027t tell me you didn\u0027t think of that already, I know you better than that!”\n Of course she does, and I\u0027m wisely keeping my tongue.\n “We\u0027ll find something for you to wear, I\u0027m sure. But I thought it\u0027d take longer for me to persuade you to come.”\n Bella sighs, the sound coming out with the wariness I\u0027ve been expecting.\n “Look, of course I\u0027m a little anxious, and I\u0027m sure that the closer the day of the party is, the more I will be nervous and all, but I know that there’s no need for me to fret over this. I trust you, even when I accuse you of being a mean bastard. I know that you wouldn\u0027t ask me to go there with you if you\u0027d think I would resent it. And I know that if I change my mind, or if I just don\u0027t like it, we\u0027ll leave.”\n Then she looks up, a dirty smile forming on those luscious lips.\n “And after all, it\u0027s in Beth\u0027s playroom, right? Where I fucked your ass the last time we were there, actually both times we were there. I don\u0027t think I have any need to be afraid of going there again.”\n Now my cock is definitely awake, and she feels it pressing into her stomach, causing her smile to turn into a veritable smirk.\n “I guess not.”\n We could keep talking about this for a while longer, but I decide that I\u0027d rather kiss her now, and she doesn\u0027t protest when I do exactly that. At first she\u0027s pliable enough, but then she pushes herself into a crouching position over me and squeezes my cock hard while her teeth sink into my lip.\n “Speaking of which, I think I should call Beth tomorrow if maybe she\u0027d like to play with us again. You\u0027ve been a horny bastard of late, always pestering me in the morning; maybe I should put you in your place again.” Her hand squeezes my dick even more until I groan, but the moment her grip eases up on me, I jerk my hips up, hoping that she won\u0027t stop there.\n Bella looks down at her hand on my cock before her eyes turn to my face again, and I grow even harder when there\u0027s no hesitation in them, no flicker of doubt.\n “I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll need Beth for that, really,” I offer when she doesn\u0027t continue. Bella frowns a little and I feel her fingers ease up on me, and my cock immediately protests. So I reach up and draw her face close to mine, kissing her passionately to show her that I trust her, and want her to trust herself.\n I\u0027m a little disappointed when she sits down on my legs again but, as her hand is still on my cock, not all hope is lost.\n “I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s a good idea,” she admits, but just when I want to launch into my pep talk she runs the thumb over her other hand over the head of my cock, teasing, toying with me.\n My eyes close on their own account and I groan, but before I can completely lose my thought I force myself to concentrate on her, and not on what she\u0027s doing.\n “Why not?”\n “I really don\u0027t know how to do it. How to set up a scene, I mean.”\n “You did really well last time with Beth, if I remember correctly.” Bella snorts. “Exactly. With Beth. I mostly rambled on about what I wanted to do in general, but she provided all the details, and how we should set things up, heighten expectations and all that.”\n “I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll do just fine on your own -” I cut off when I feel her nails run up the length of my shaft, basically wiping my brain for a few seconds. She really doesn\u0027t know what she\u0027s doing to me, or else she wouldn\u0027t think for a second that she could do anything wrong.\n “Bella, trust me, you can do it if you want to.” She stops for a moment, grinning at my needy pants, and I try to rally what\u0027s left of my mind to go on. “And you don\u0027t have to do the planning alone; I\u0027ll help you if you want me to.”\n “You would?”\n I\u0027m a little hurt that she sounds so surprised.\n “Of course I would, why shouldn\u0027t I? No offense, but my playroom, my gear, I should know how to use it all and explain and help you there. With everything.”\n “But then you\u0027ll know what I\u0027m up to!”\n “And?”\n She looks baffled for a moment, but then considers my offer in earnest.\n “Okay. But I want something in return.”\n Anything. Really anything. But she should know that she can always ask anything of me.\n “Sure, what?”\n Her smile is triumphant now.\n “I want in on the scene planning when I\u0027m subbing, too.” That surprises me a little as she\u0027s never asked that of me before, but it really shouldn\u0027t as we\u0027ve just had the exact same point with our roles reversed. Before I can do more than nod, she explains further.\n “Like, I\u0027d like you to explain to me how you do that for anything you\u0027re up to this week. Where you get your ideas from, how you decide what to do to me, what toys to use, how to tie me up, when you want to play, everything.\n Maybe we can discuss some of that, too. Maybe even try something new, I mean the wax play was fun, I\u0027m sure there are some other things you\u0027ve been itching to do but we never got round to actually trying them. And after this week I\u0027ll do some research, and we can sit down and I can tell you what I come up with for you. You just help me work out the details and how-tos. How does that sound?”\n Like I\u0027ve died and gone to heaven, or maybe that\u0027s hell considering what we\u0027re talking about, anyway, I\u0027m in paradise.\n “Have I told you of late how much I love you?”\n She grins at my emphatic words and leans down to kiss me, but stops before our lips come even close. I try to crane my neck and close the distance, but then she\u0027s squeezing my cock again and I fall back into the cushions of the couch.\n “You sure that\u0027s not just your cock talking?” she teases me.\n “I am pretty sure that\u0027s my heart and mind, because seriously, my cock\u0027s concerned with other things right now!”\n “Oh, really? Like what?”\n “Like begging you not to stop!”\n Her smile brightens, and she licks her lips as she looks down at the concerned piece of me.\n “I think I should be gracious and grant your cock that attention. But you\u0027re not getting away so easily, mister.”\n I\u0027m surprised when she lets go of me and gets up, but my apprehension is gone when she steps out of her sweats and thong, and gets back onto the couch, her knees left and right of my head while she\u0027s facing my legs.\n “Be a good boy and show my pussy some love, will you?” I don\u0027t really need the incentive as my hands are already on her thighs, spreading them wider as I pull her down towards me. Bella sighs contently as I lick up and down her wet pussy lips, before I suck on her clit. Her hand squeezes my cock hard in what I think is some kind of involuntary reaction, but then she\u0027s pumping me while her other hand is gripping my balls none to gently. Her hips buck and she\u0027s rubbing herself all over my face, but I couldn\u0027t care less. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/beautiful-disaster-beautiful-1/page-4.html","bookId":2786,"book":{"id":2786,"title":"Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Beautiful Disaster (Beautiful #1) \n INTENSE.
