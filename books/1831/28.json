Was he a mind reader? Her glasses were right where he’d told her they were. “How did you know—”\\n\\n “You’re squinting,” he answered before she could finish her sentence. “And you just ran into a chair.”\\n\\n “I wasn’t watching where I was going.”\\n\\n He laughed. “You couldn’t see where you were going.”\\n\\n Jordan noticed water spots on her lenses and went back into the bathroom. She thought she heard someone knocking on her door and called out, “Noah, could you get that?”\\n\\n A few seconds later she heard a woman’s voice coming from Noah’s room. The knocking had been at his door, not hers. Curious, she hurriedly cleaned her glasses, slipped them on, and went into the bedroom. Oh, great. Noah was getting personalized turn-down service, and Amelia Ann was doing the honors. Noah leaned against the door frame watching her, but when he heard Jordan, he glanced over his shoulder and winked at her.\\n\\n He was getting a kick out of the preferential treatment. Jordan wasn’t. She couldn’t stop staring at Amelia Ann through the doorway. The woman was dressed like a cocktail waitress in a seedy bar. She had on short-shorts; red, open-toed, stiletto heels; and a low-cut blouse she’d apparently forgotten to button. She was definitely advertising. The way she bent over the bed when she smoothed the sheets was comical, but Jordan wasn’t laughing. Amelia Ann’s behavior was disgraceful.\\n\\n Muttering to herself, Jordan spun around and pulled off her own bedspread. She put it in the corner, then dumped a stack of papers in the middle of the bed, grabbed a bottle of water, and sat down to read.\\n\\n The room phone rang. It was her sister, Sidney, calling. “You’ll never guess where I am.”\\n\\n “I don’t want to guess. Tell me,” Jordan said.\\n\\n “You don’t have caller ID?”\\n\\n “You called my motel room, Sidney. You should know I don’t have caller ID.”\\n\\n “I’m in Los Angeles, and I’m surrounded by boxes. Since I can’t check into my dorm for another week and a half, I’m stuck in a hotel. Actually, it’s a very nice hotel,” she admitted. “The bellman carried up all my stuff.”\\n\\n “I thought Mother was going out there with you next week. Why are you there so early?”\\n\\n “Everything suddenly changed,” she said. “I spent the other night with my friend Christy, and when I got home the next morning, Mom had my flight all set up. It was like she couldn’t wait another minute to get rid of me. I think I was driving her crazy worrying out loud about Dad.”\\n\\n “So you’re on your own now.”\\n\\n “And loving it,” she said. “I’m going overboard with room service, but since I can’t get into my dorm, what else can I do? I hope Dad doesn’t have a fit when he gets the bill on his credit card.”\\n\\n “How’s Dad doing?”\\n\\n “Okay, I guess. You know Dad. Death threats don’t seem to faze him. Mother’s another story though. She’s a wreck, but trying not to let it show. Everyone is so stressed out over this trial.”\\n\\n “Any updates on when it will be over?” Jordan asked.\\n\\n “No,” Sidney answered. “Dad’s bodyguards are becoming permanent fixtures on Nathan’s Bay. Everywhere I looked, there they were: constant reminders that someone wants our father dead.”\\n\\n “The threats will stop as soon as there’s a verdict.”\\n\\n “How can you know that for certain? That’s what everyone keeps saying, but come on, Jordan, this is a racketeering case. It’s…major.”\\n\\n Jordan heard the anxiety in Sidney’s voice. “I know.”\\n\\n “And if that horrible man is convicted, won’t his family and his business associates still come after Dad? And if he’s not convicted, won’t the other side—?”\\n\\n Jordan cut her off. “You’ll drive yourself nuts thinking about all of this. You have to hope for the best.”\\n\\n “Easier said than done,” she replied. “I am glad I came out here early. I was making it worse on Mom. Now she’s got Laurant to worry about…and Nick’s freaking out…”\\n\\n “Wait a minute. What did you say? What’s wrong with Nick and Laurant?”\\n\\n “Nothing’s wrong with Nick. His wife is the worry. I thought you knew…”\\n\\n “Knew what?” she asked impatiently.\\n\\n “Laurant started having labor pains, really bad labor pains, and the doctor put her in the hospital. She can’t have the baby yet. She’s only six months along.”\\n\\n “When did this happen?”\\n\\n “Nick took her to the hospital yesterday. I was already on my way to L. A.”\\n\\n Had Jordan talked to her brother since then? She couldn’t remember.\\n\\n “It’s a good thing Nick came back home early and Noah stayed with you, isn’t it? It would be awful if he was that far away when Laurant started having problems.”\\n\\n “Poor Laurant. What’s the doctor saying?”\\n\\n “I don’t know,” Sidney answered. “Mom told me she’s hooked up to an IV. They’ve slowed down the contractions, but they haven’t stopped them completely. Listen, when will you get home? Mom sure could use your support now. You’re always so cool and calm about everything. Nothing rattles you.”\\n\\n Not anymore, Jordan thought. Thanks to Noah, everything rattled her.\\n\\n From the corner of her eye, Jordan saw Noah walking toward her, and she promptly lost her train of thought. He wore jeans and a clean T-shirt. He put his gun and holster on the nightstand and stretched out next to her on the bed.\\n\\n “Jordan? Didn’t you hear me? I asked when you were leaving.”\\n\\n “What…uh…I…” Oh sure, she never got rattled. “Tomorrow,” she stammered. Noah had reached up and was pulling her down next to him. “Early. We’re leaving early. We have a long drive to the Austin airport.” She pushed Noah’s hand away and turned around. Frowning at him, she wagged her finger in his face and whispered, “Stop it.”\\n\\n “Stop what?” Sidney asked.\\n\\n “Nothing. I should go.”\\n\\n “Wait. Do you think I should fly back home?” asked Sidney. “I could maybe help out—”\\n\\n “No, no, you should stay where you are. There’s nothing you could do back home. I’ll call you as soon as I get back.”\\n\\n “Don’t hang up. I didn’t ask you how you’re doing.”\\n\\n Noah was tickling her neck, causing shivers. “Fine. I’m doing fine,” she blurted.\\n\\n “Did they find the degenerate who was stuffing those bodies in your car?”\\n\\n “Yes, they did. Talk to you tomorrow. ’Bye now. Keep safe.”\\n\\n She hung up before Sidney could stop her. Then she turned to confront Noah.\\n\\n “Trying to distract…” That was as far as she got before she again lost her train of thought. Noah was pulling off his T-shirt. He had an amazing body. His upper arms were so muscular, and his abs…\\n\\n She mentally shook herself out of her stupor. “What are you doing?”\\n\\n “Getting comfortable.”\\n\\n She grabbed his hands when he tried to take his jeans off. “For the love of…Unless you plan to get under the covers, I suggest you keep your pants on.”\\n\\n “Are you embarrassed?” He seemed puzzled by the possibility. “Sugar, you’ve seen and touched every—”\\n\\n “I remember very clearly what I did,” she interrupted. She suddenly laughed. “You don’t have any inhibitions, do you? I’ll bet you could walk down Newbury Street in Boston stark na*ed and not be fazed.”\\n\\n He grinned. “Depends.”\\n\\n “On what?”\\n\\n “Whether it’s summer or winter.”\\n\\n She rolled her eyes. “It’s presumptuous to think you can waltz in here and sleep with me.”\\n\\n He adjusted the pillows behind his head. “I don’t waltz anywhere, and I don’t plan to sleep, at least not for a very long while. So, do you want me to leave?”\\n\\n That question was a no-brainer. “No.”\\n\\n She leaned over him, planted her hands on his warm chest, and kissed him. Then she pinched his shoulder and sat up.\\n\\n “I know you’ve talked to Nick,” she said accusingly. “Why didn’t you tell me what was going on?”\\n\\n He looked surprised. “Sidney told you? I didn’t think she knew. Your mother got her out of Boston early so she wouldn’t find out.”\\n\\n “Nick should have called me.”\\n\\n “Nick didn’t want you to worry, and he knew that you would hear about it when you got back to Boston.”\\n\\n She sat back on her heels. “Find out what?”\\n\\n He frowned. “Hold on. What exactly did Sidney tell you?”\\n\\n “No. I want to hear your version.”\\n\\n “Someone broke into your parents’ house and left a note for your father in his library. It was stuck to a wall with a knife.”\\n\\n “When did he find it?”\\n\\n Noah hated to tell her. “He didn’t. Your mother did.” He sighed and added, “Whoever it was got in sometime during the night. She found it the next morning before your father came down.”\\n\\n Jordan pictured some maniac with a knife creeping through the house and starting up the stairs. She shivered. “They were asleep? Where were the bodyguards?”\\n\\n “Good question,” he said. “There were two of them. One outside and one in. Neither one heard or saw a thing.”\\n\\n She felt sick to her stomach. “He could have gone into their bedroom. And Sidney…”\\n\\n “She wasn’t there,” Noah said. “She was at a friend’s house.”\\n\\n Jordan nodded. “They can get to my father anytime they want, can’t they?”\\n\\n “No. Your brothers are in this now and have beefed up security. No one’s going to get that close again.”\\n\\n She didn’t believe him. “What did the note say?”\\n\\n “I’m not sure I remember…”\\n\\n “Tell me,” she insisted.\\n\\n “Jordan, it was just a scare tactic.”\\n\\n “I want to know what that note said, Noah. Tell me.”\\n\\n “Okay…,” he answered reluctantly. “The note said, ‘We’re watching.’”\\n\\n Chapter Thirty-two\\n\\n JORDAN’S ANXIETY ABOUT HER FAMILY WOULDN’T EASE UP. She kept thinking about her mother and father asleep in their bed while a cold-blooded killer roamed their house. What made the situation even more chilling was the fact that there were two professional bodyguards on duty, and the intruder had been able to get past them.\\n\\n Holding her in his arms, Noah listened as she played out every possible scenario: what could have happened, what didn’t happen, and what might possibly happen in the future. He’d heard it all before from Nick, who had gone into a rage when he’d found out about the break-in.\\n\\n “You knew about Laurant too, didn’t you?” Jordan asked. Noah didn’t answer fast enough to suit her. “Didn’t you?”\\n\\n “Ouch! Stop pinching me. And yes, I knew about Laurant.”\\n\\n “So why didn’t you tell me?”\\n\\n He grabbed her hand before she could pinch him again. “Nick didn’t want me to.”\\n\\n “Let me guess. He didn’t want me to worry.”\\n\\n “That’s right.”\\n\\n She jerked her hand back, rolled away from him, and sat up. “My father and Laurant…what other secrets are out there?”\\n\\n “None that I know about,” he said. “And it’s not going to do you any good to get all worked up about it.”\\n\\n His calm attitude didn’t sit well with her. “Well, I am already worked up about it.”\\n\\n “Don’t be so hard on your brother. Nick was only trying to protect you.”\\n\\n “Don’t defend him.”\\n\\n “I’m only saying that Nick thought you had plenty to worry about. He was planning to fill you in on everything when you got back to Boston. And Laurant’s doing okay.”\\n\\n “She’s in the hospital. That isn’t ‘doing okay.’”\\n\\n “She’s getting the care she needs.”\\n\\n Jordan shook her head. “If you were my brother and I kept something like this from you, how would you feel?”\\n\\n He gave her a sideways glance. “Sugar, if I were your brother, we’d have a much bigger problem to worry about.”\\n\\n To make his point, his hand slipped under her T-shirt and tugged on the waistband of her shorts.\\n\\n “Okay, that was a bad example.” She gathered up the papers. “I just hate secrets,” she muttered.\\n\\n “Is that so? You’re pretty damned good at keeping secrets yourself.”\\n\\n He sounded angry. Surprised by his sudden mood swing, she asked, “What’s that supposed to mean? I don’t keep secrets.”\\n\\n “Want to tell me about that little scar on the side of your right breast?”\\n\\n Pretending that she didn’t know what he was talking about probably wouldn’t work. Knowing Noah, he’d pull off her T-shirt and point to it.\\n\\n “What about it?”\\n\\n “I seem to remember hearing about your surgery.”\\n\\n “That was…a while ago,” she said, trying to think of a way to get out of the corner she’d trapped herself in. “It wasn’t a big deal.”\\n\\n “Here’s my question,” he said. “Didn’t you find a lump in your breast—”\\n\\n “It was just a little bump.”\\n\\n Ignoring her interruption, he continued, “And didn’t you check yourself into the hospital and have the surgery without telling anyone in your family?”\\n\\n She took a breath. “Yes, but it was a procedure…a biopsy…”\\n\\n “Doesn’t matter. You didn’t want anyone to worry, did you? What if something had gone wrong? What if the procedure had turned into major surgery?”\\n\\n “Kate drove me to the hospital. She would have called everyone.”\\n\\n “And you think that’s okay?”\\n\\n “No,” Jordan admitted. “It was wrong. But I was scared. And telling everyone made it more real.”\\n\\n Strangely enough, he understood. He took her hand and squeezed it. “I’ll tell you what. You ever pull a stunt like that on me, and there’ll be hell to pay.” Just thinking about the possibility of her keeping something that serious from him made him angry. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-dance-buchanan-renard-6/page-28.html","bookId":1831,"book":{"id":1831,"title":"Shadow Dance (Buchanan-Renard #6)","description":"Storyline: Jordan Buchanan is thrilled that her brother and best friend are tying the knot. The wedding is a lavish affair–for the marriage of Dylan Buchanan and Kate MacKenna is no ordinary occasion. It represents the joining of two family dynasties. The ceremony and reception proceed without a hitch–until a crasher appears claiming to be a MacKenna guest.

So she is intrigued but skeptical of the professor’s claims that the feud has been kept alive by the grave injustices the Buchanans have perpetrated over the centuries. But when Noah Clayborne, a close family friend and a man who has never let a good time or a pretty girl pass him by, accuses Jordan of being trapped in her comfort zone, she determines to prove him wrong and sets out on a spontaneous adventure to the small, dusty town of Serenity, Texas, to judge the professor’s research for herself. \\n Maneuvering through a close-knit community in which everyone knows everyone else’s business, Jordan never anticipates the danger and intrigue that lie in her path, nor the threat that will shadow her back to Boston, where even in familiar surroundings, her life is at risk. \\n A powerful thug who rules by fear, a man who harbors a simmering secret, and an unexpected romance that pierces all defenses–beloved author Julie Garwood weaves these dazzling elements into a brilliant novel of romantic suspense.
