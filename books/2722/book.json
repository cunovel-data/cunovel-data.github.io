{"id":2722,"title":"Shug","description":"Storyline: SHUG is clever and brave and true (on the inside, anyway). And she\u0027s about to become your new best friend. \\n Annemarie Wilcox, or Shug as her family calls her, is beginning to think there\u0027s nothing worse than being twelve. She\u0027s too tall, too freckled, and way too flat-chested. Shug is sure that there\u0027s not one good or amazing thing about her. And now she has to start junior high, where the friends she counts most dear aren\u0027t acting so dear anymore -- especially Mark, the boy she\u0027s known her whole life through. Life is growing up all around her, and all Shug wants is for things to be like they used to be. How is a person supposed to prepare for what happens tomorrow when there\u0027s just no figuring out today?\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/shug.jpg","author":"Jenny Han","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
