{"id":85467,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"FIFTEEN After Jimmy parked the moving van, I told him to sit in a window seat inside the Burger King so our shadows could keep an eye on him from the parking lot. I sat with him for a minute. \"What if they\u0027re Feds?\" asked Jimmy. I\u0027d thought of that, but it seemed more likely the Tempo on our tail were Beggar\u0027s boys trying to track down those ledgers. I\u0027d been thinking a lot about Alan Jeffers. He knew I had the books. I was supposed to bring them to him, but it looked like he was turning rat, willing to hand over the books to the FBI. But if that were the case, why hadn\u0027t Agent Dunn put the squeeze on me? I kept chewing that question over in my mind, but only one answer even came close to making sense. Jeffers was playing both sides. He told the FBI he was trying to get the books for them, and he told Beggar he was doing the same thing for him. In the middle sat Alan Jeffers, thumbing coke up his nose and wondering how he was going to pull his ass out of the meat-grinder. So I didn\u0027t think they were Feds following me, because Alan Jeffers hadn\u0027t told them they should. I didn\u0027t take the time to explain all this to Jimmy. I just told him to trust me. \"I\u0027ll be back. Stay in the window where they can see you.\" \"What for?\" \"Because you\u0027re decoy-boy.\" \"What\u0027re you going to do?\" \"Just wait.\" Jimmy looked worried as I left him. I high-stepped it out the other side of the restaurant and circled behind. From between two Dumpsters, I could see the goons in the Tempo. They smoked cigarettes and watched Jimmy through the window. I watched for a minute, but they didn\u0027t look like they suspected anything. I continued my wide circle behind the gas station, all the time keeping an eye on the Tempo, but they didn\u0027t notice me. I ducked into the gas station. Inside, I bought a cheap pocketknife, a thick, souvenir Florida State Seminoles throw pillow, and a roll of duct tape. You can do abso-fucking-lutely anything with duct tape. Astronauts should take a dozen rolls on every shuttle mission. The girl behind the register raised an eyebrow. \"Don\u0027t ask.\" I locked myself in the men\u0027s room around the side of the gas station. A quick glance on the way in told me Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum were still keeping watch on the Burger King. I cut a slit down the side of the Seminole throw pillow. I fished one of the automatics out of my shoulder holster and jammed it into the pillow, where it nested tightly in the heart of the stuffing. I wrapped the pillow in duct tape and kept wrapping until I\u0027d used half the roll. The whole thing was now a tight wad of stuffing armored with several layers of tape. I dropped the knife into my pants pocket and threw away the rest of the tape. The pillow looked like a misshapen, armadillo-skinned football. I tucked it under my arm and headed for the Tempo. They were either amateurs, or they let themselves get too comfortable watching Jimmy through the BK window. In any case, I came upon them and swung open the back door on the passenger side without any resistance. I slid into the backseat and slammed the door as they jerked around frowning at the surprise of me. \"What in the hell-\" \"Shaddup.\" I pulled the automatic out of the pillow and showed it to them. \"Keep still, and do like I tell you. Get your hands up where I can see them.\" They put their hands up on the steering wheel and dashboard. \"I don\u0027t know who you think you are, but-\" \"You\u0027re even dumber than you look.\" I let him feel the automatic\u0027s cool metal on the back of his neck. He was the one in the passenger side. Clearly another low-forehead type in a cheap suit and three-dollar haircut. The guy behind the wheel was a stick figure with one of those Don Juan skinny mustaches and an overbite that gave him a rat look. \"You just talk when I tell you, and we can all be chums.\" Before some passerby phoned the law, I brought the automatic down and stuffed it back in the pillow, keeping a loose finger on the trigger. Both of them faced forward waiting for me to speak. They didn\u0027t look particularly worried, so I knew this wasn\u0027t their first picnic. I\u0027d need to get tough. The one with the cheap haircut tsked at me. He was taking the hard line. \"Pal, I think you need to reconsider your position. If you knew who we-\" I pulled the pistol out of the pillow again and smacked the barrel across the base of his skull. He grunted, bent forward and stayed there, moaning softly and rubbing his new lump. \"You dipshit,\" said the other, \"you just assaulted a federal officer. That\u0027s five years hard time. You want to try for more?\" \"What the fuck are you talking about?\" \"Okay, now listen.\" He said the words slowly, like he was talking to a dog or a retard. \"I\u0027m going to go into my jacket for my badge. No funny stuff. I promise.\" I pointed the gun at him. \"Slow.\" He came out with the standard-issue billfold, flipped it open. A badge. An ID that said he was FBI Agent Nicholas Styles. He nodded at his buddy in the passenger seat. \"He\u0027s Agent Novak. He\u0027d show you his ID too, but he\u0027s not feeling so well.\" God damn. They were Feds. \"Now, how about handing over that gun, Swift? It\u0027s really your only option.\" \"Just hold on a second.\" I\u0027d really stepped in it this time. I had to think. \"The longer you wait, the worse it gets for you, Swift,\" said Styles. \"Just hand me the gun.\" \"I said shut up a minute.\" Novak groaned. The knot on the back of his head was swelling good and quick. \"He might have a concussion.\" \"So what?\" \"So if he sustains some sort of serious injury because you prevented me from getting him to a doctor, and then he dies, I guess you can tack on a murder charge.\" I knew I hadn\u0027t hit him hard enough for that, but I was getting flustered. I had to get control of the situation again. People were going in and out of the gas station, and I remembered I was waving a pistol around. I stuck it back in the pillow. \"What\u0027s it going to be, Swift?\" I decided I should be the one asking questions. \"What are you tailing me for?\" \"Orders.\" \"You can do better than that.\" \"How many times do I have to say it?\" asked Styles. \"We\u0027re the FBI. We don\u0027t answer to cheap hoods.\" \"I don\u0027t care if you\u0027re J. Edgar Hoover in a ball gown,\" I said. \"Did Agent Dunn put you on my tail?\" Dunn had warned me to skip town. Maybe he\u0027d set these two jerks the task of making sure I left. At the mention of Dunn\u0027s name Novak lifted his head, and he and Styles looked at each other a moment. It wasn\u0027t much, but it was enough to tell me something was going on. \"Of course,\" said Styles. \"Orders from Dunn. Who else?\" Who else? Good question. I said, \"Okay. Call Dunn. We\u0027ll wait for him. I\u0027ll surrender to him. Nice and quiet.\" It wasn\u0027t much of a bluff, but I\u0027d sensed some kind of chink in the armor at the mention of Dunn\u0027s name. I had to see how they\u0027d react. Novak spoke first, but not to me. To Styles. \"Nick, we can\u0027t call Dunn. He\u0027ll-\" \"Quiet!\" Styles shifted his eyes from me to Novak and back. \"Enough of your double-talk, Swift. Stalling for time won\u0027t help you.\" I nodded to myself, tried not to let my smile show. They might\u0027ve been big-shot FBI agents, but they were basically still cops, and like all cops they\u0027d come to depend on people falling into line whenever they flashed their badges. I\u0027d seen past the badge, and I saw only a couple of jokers trying to pull a bluff. \"You don\u0027t have orders to tail me at all, do you?\" \"Don\u0027t be moronic, Swift.\" \"Doing a little overtime work, eh boys?\" I smiled openly now. \"What did you think? That I\u0027d lead you to those ledgers? Novak groaned louder. \"Can\u0027t you see he\u0027s hurt?\" said Styles. \"Too bad.\" Novak really groaned this time, and I leaned forward to tell him to put a sock in it. He twisted suddenly in his seat and reached over at me. He grabbed my wrist with one hand, went for the gun-pillow with the other. What happened next was strictly reflex. I squeezed the automatic\u0027s trigger inside the pillow, and the stuffing dulled the report to a thick fwup. The.45 slug tore through the back of the seat and found a home in Novak\u0027s back. He wheezed, twitched once, and fell over his folded hands on the dash like he\u0027d fallen asleep at prayer. \"Shit!\" The blood drained from Styles\u0027s face. I thought he might be sick. \"God, Swift, what\u0027d you do?\" \"The same thing that\u0027s going to happen to you if you don\u0027t answer some questions.\" I had to keep talking tough, had to keep control of the situation, but inside my guts churned. What had I done? \"Jesus, Swift.\" He was shaking his head, looking at his buddy. \"Don\u0027t kill me, okay?\" He started breathing hard and sniffling. I thought he was ready to start the waterworks. \"Knock it off,\" I said. \"Think hard and answer my question.\" \"What fucking question?\" He voice was strained. He talked to me, but his eyes stayed on Novak. \"Why are you tailing me? I know Dunn didn\u0027t put you up to it, so don\u0027t try to tell me he did. I can smell it every time you lie.\" \"Like you said. We wanted the ledgers.\" \"Why?\" \"Why? What do you mean why, you son of a bitch? They outline Beggar Johnson\u0027s whole operation. Whoever has those ledgers has Beggar by the throat.\" \"So if I have them, I guess I\u0027m pretty big shit.\" \"You\u0027d get Beggar\u0027s attention, that\u0027s for sure.\" \"That\u0027s all I wanted to know.\" I pulled the trigger, and the automatic belched inside the pillow, spit lead and stuffing at Styles. He fell over the steering wheel dead. I kept telling myself I had to do it. I was already up to my neck for killing Novak. I might have gotten away with the four agents I\u0027d popped in Toppers, but Novak had been different. Styles had seen me. If I let Styles go, I\u0027d have every cop in the state on my ass within an hour. This was how I explained it all to myself. This was how I tried to convince myself I was still in control of the situation. So why were my hands shaking so much when I reached inside Styles\u0027s jacket and then Novak\u0027s? I pulled out their badges and slipped them into my jacket pocket. It wasn\u0027t that I wanted some morbid souvenir. I just knew these guys would be found sooner or later. Maybe the gas station owner would notice the car had been there awhile. A couple of dead bodies would cause a fuss, but a couple of dead FBI guys would set off alarms all over the place. I figured I could toss the badges in a Dumpster down the road. I climbed out of the Tempo, closed the door, looked all around, over my shoulder. As far as I could tell, nobody had taken notice of me or seen what I\u0027d done. I walked back toward the Burger King, feet leaden, arms rubbery. How had everything gone so horribly down the shitter? I felt overwhelmed, that I was screwing this all up, leaving a trail of bodies a blind man could follow. Any minute now the Feds would swoop down on me with the handcuffs or Beggar\u0027s boys would come along and throw a sack over me. Forget it. I\u0027d had enough. I went into the Burger King. \"Let\u0027s go,\" I said to Jimmy. \"What happened?\" I started walking out, motioned for him to follow. \"Take me back to my car.\" \"What? Why?\" \"I\u0027m tired.\" He saw my duct tape pillow. \"What the hell\u0027s that?\" I ignored his question. \"I\u0027m going home. You were right. Stan\u0027s dead or gone.\" \"We don\u0027t know that.\" Jimmy waddled after me, out of the Burger King and into the parking lot. \"What about the warehouse?\" \"Forget it.\" \"Forget it?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" I climbed into the moving van\u0027s passenger seat and waited for Jimmy to drive. He hauled himself into the van\u0027s cab with a grunt and settled his gut behind the wheel. I made it clear I didn\u0027t want to talk. He drove back to his house where my car was parked. I got out and walked around to his side of the van, and he rolled down the window. \"Sorry, Jimmy. But this was all crazy from the beginning. I should\u0027ve just taken everybody\u0027s advice and disappeared. We can\u0027t help Stan. You should go too, Jimmy, or you\u0027ll end up like Larry Cartwright and Bob Tate. Take your kid and go. There\u0027s no magic stash of money, and only God can help Stan now.\" \"Sheesh, Charlie, I don\u0027t know what to say. Call if you hear something.\" \"I won\u0027t. I\u0027m leaving town.\" \"I mean it,\" said Jimmy. \"Just get some rest. Things will settle down.\" \"Sure, Jimmy.\" I got in my car and drove away. I pulled up in front of my apartment slowly. I hadn\u0027t been there in a while, but somebody might still be waiting around to do me some harm. I got out and climbed the stairs, my eyes darting into every shadow. Seemed safe enough. I went inside with guns drawn, but there was no need. All clear. I went to grab my green duffel bag and remembered it was full of incriminating accounting ledgers in an airport locker. I took a big red Samsonite suitcase from underneath the bed and put it on top. Opened it. I shoved in about a week\u0027s worth of shirts and underwear and socks. An extra pair of shoes. I put in two more suits, tried to fold them in easy so they wouldn\u0027t wrinkle too bad. I saw my National Geographic on the table and tossed it in. The rest of my stuff could rot. I almost packed my toothbrush when I remembered I hadn\u0027t used it in a while. I went into the bathroom and brushed my teeth. It occurred to me I was greasy and messed up. I stripped out of my smelly clothes and let them drop on the bathroom floor. I kept my revolver close by on the sink just in case. The shower was warm. I just stood in the hot water a long time, maybe twenty minutes. It felt like the best thing in the world. When the hot water started losing strength, I shut off the shower and stepped out. The wound on my side had started to scab okay, so I didn\u0027t bandage it again. I looked at my bed. Tempting. No. I\u0027d fooled around long enough. Time to get the hell out of Dodge. Everything else could go to hell. I toweled off, climbed into a dark gray suit, and strapped my guns back on. I grabbed my suitcase. Adios, fuckers. I put my hand on the doorknob. The phone rang. The little guy in my head who tries to keep me out of trouble shouted don\u0027t pick it up, dumbass. I picked it up. \"Yeah?\" A brief pause, then: \"Charlie?\" \"Marcie?\" \"Oh, Charlie. For God\u0027s sake where have you been?\" She sounded frazzled. \"I\u0027ve been calling and calling.\" \"What\u0027s wrong? Are you okay?\" \"No, I mean, I am now. But I need you.\" \"Slow down. What is it?\" \"Not on the phone. Come over.\" I glanced at my suitcase. \"I\u0027m right in the middle of something here, hon.\" \"CHARLIE, COME OVER RIGHT FUCKING NOW!\" \"Okay, okay. Take it easy. Just calm down. I\u0027m on my way.\" \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to yell. Just please come over.\" \"Okay. It\u0027ll be okay. I\u0027ll fix it.\" I didn\u0027t know what it was yet, but I\u0027d fix it. I hung up after promising about twenty more times that I was on my way. I checked my guns, and everything was go. I got back in my Buick and headed for Marcie\u0027s house at top speed. Halfway there I realized I hadn\u0027t brought the suitcase.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gun-monkeys/page-15.html","bookId":2246,"book":{"id":2246,"title":"Gun Monkeys","description":"Storyline: Charlie Swift just pumped three .38-caliber bullets into a dead polar bear in his taxidermist girlfriend’s garage.
