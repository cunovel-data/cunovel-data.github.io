{"id":85453,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"ONE I turned the Chrysler onto the Florida Turnpike with Rollo Kramer\u0027s headless body in the trunk, and all the time I\u0027m thinking I should\u0027ve put some plastic down. I knew the heap was a rental, but I didn\u0027t like leaving anything behind for the inevitable forensics safari. That meant I\u0027d have to strip all the carpeting in the trunk, douche out the blood with Clorox, and hope Avis took a long time to notice. I should\u0027ve just taken a second and put some plastic down. Shit. \"Slow down, Charlie. You\u0027ll flag us.\" Blade Sanchez popped a Winston into his mouth, crumpled the pack, and tossed it into the backseat. I grabbed the cigarette out of his mouth and jammed it into the ashtray. \"You light another one of them fucking things, and you\u0027re in the trunk with Rollo.\" \"Christalmighty, that\u0027s my last one. Jesus, Charlie. What the fuck?\" He pawed at the cigarette, but I\u0027d smashed it up good. \"I just said slow down is all. You want the state police should pull us over and find Rollo?\" It\u0027s your fault he\u0027s back there, I thought. But I slowed down. He was right, and that made me like him even less. \"You botched this good.\" \"So you keep telling me,\" said Blade. Me and some of the other boys had been riding Blade Sanchez hard about his lack of originality. We called him \"Blade\" because he always whacked his marks the same way: a quick flick of his stiletto, an ear-to-ear smile. That\u0027s a sure way to tip your hand, doing it the same way every time. Not quite as bad as leaving a thumbprint, but it sure helps the profilers put together an M.O. when you fall into a pattern. Everyone knows what everyone\u0027s up to. It\u0027s just the difficulty proving it that keeps guys like Blade out of stir. Now me, I\u0027d never, ever developed bad habits or fallen into a routine, and as a result my name wasn\u0027t on a single piece of paper in a single precinct in any state in the union or the District of Columbia. Anyway, we were riding Blade pretty good about his knife at O\u0027Malley\u0027s over beers. And mostly we were kidding, but he was getting pretty sore, because he knew it was true. That\u0027s when guys get the most sore, when they know something\u0027s true. It was the night before we got this Rollo job, and Blade pulled me aside and practically begged me to let him be trigger man. He already knew I didn\u0027t want to work with him, and now everyone was on his case about his knife, so he was all eager to show he could bump this Rollo guy in some new and improved way. As if me and the rest of the boys still wouldn\u0027t think Blade was a moron. So I had a couple of drinks, and he wore me down. And before I knew what I was saying, I told him he could do Rollo, only don\u0027t screw it up or he\u0027d have all of our balls in a vise. Of course, it all went to shit. I should have known better. When I picked up Blade the morning we were supposed to whack Rollo, gray clouds hung heavy in the winter sky but didn\u0027t quite threaten rain. All January the temperature hadn\u0027t dipped below fifty. Got to love the Sunshine State. Blade had a fresh box of doughnuts all tied up in a yellow ribbon. I though maybe they were for us. \"Hands off,\" said Blade. \"They\u0027re for Rollo.\" \"Last meal?\" Blade tapped a finger against his temple. \"Research, compadre, research. Old Rollo\u0027s a doughnut junkie.\" Rollo\u0027s neighborhood looked like something God had scraped off His shoe. Dull brick buildings hunched along the wide street. Every third car was stripped and up on cinder blocks. The front lawns were yellowing postage stamps of dying grass. I pulled the Chrysler into an empty spot across from Rollo\u0027s rented house. Blade looked up and down the street shaking his head. \"Whoever said crime don\u0027t pay must\u0027ve been thinking of Rollo.\" I didn\u0027t answer him, but I understood. It was like any other job. You were either good at it, or you weren\u0027t. Rollo Kramer wasn\u0027t very good at his job. He\u0027d been a middleman for Beggar Johnson, a big-time boss hood from down in Miami. Rollo thought skimming off the top of Beggar\u0027s take would be a good way to supplement his income. Beggar caught Rollo with his hand in the till, and Rollo fled north. Orlando. Our territory. Since Beggar knew Blade from the old days, he\u0027d asked Stan personally to put Blade on the job. But the problem was that Blade Sanchez was a grade-A screwup, and Stan had him on probation. Sanchez had stuck his knife into the wrong guy in Detroit, and a month before that he\u0027d dropped the ball in Tampa, letting a city councilman with a bull\u0027s-eye on his chest slip out of the crosshairs. So there I was in the car next to him on babysitting duty, making sure Blade didn\u0027t eat his own gun or forget to breathe or some damn thing. I\u0027d made it clear I wasn\u0027t happy with the job, but since I had Stan to thank for every nickel hidden in my safe deposit box, I couldn\u0027t really turn him down. Blade slipped into a Do-nut Barn jacket and delivered the box to Rollo\u0027s front door. When he returned, I gave him the fish eye. \"What? Poison?\" Blade shook his head. \"You\u0027ll see. I told him it was a gift from an admirer.\" \"Just what? Wait?\" \"Wait.\" So I waited. I pulled an old issue of National Geographic out of my topcoat and looked at the front for the hundredth time. On the cover, the beautiful brown face of a young Polynesian woman hovered in front of an expanse of virgin beach and deep green sea. I\u0027d read every word of the article three times. I folded the magazine. It bulged awkwardly in the pocket of my topcoat, so I dropped it on the floor. Waiting sucked. \"That was Rollo at the door?\" I asked. \"Yeah.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you push him inside and whack him right then?\" Blade frowned. \"Whatever.\" God damn hotdog amateur. Long seconds crept past. \"If he\u0027s such an addict, don\u0027t you think he\u0027ll already have doughnuts?\" \"These are fresh.\" The explosion shattered the windows in Rollo\u0027s house and shook the rental car. \"What the fuck was that?\" Blade grinned big. \"That would be the Boston cream.\" We tumbled out of the Chrysler and ran up the walk and into Rollo\u0027s house to the scream of car alarms set off by the blast. I kicked in the door, and we found what was left of Rollo still sitting in a ladderback chair blown back about ten feet from the kitchen table. \"Holy shit, Blade.\" Rollo\u0027s neck still oozed dark liquid. It pooled around his body on the linoleum. The walls and ceiling looked like a giant anteater had sneezed a watermelon. Thick chunks of red gunk dripped from the kitchen cabinets, and hung in gelatinous strands from the ceiling fan. Blade looked around like he couldn\u0027t believe what he\u0027d done. \"Where\u0027s his head?\" I squinted hard at something fuzzy and bloody in the sink. \"I think this is a piece here. Crap. What\u0027d you put in that doughnut?\" \"Four blasting caps.\" I shook my head. \"Idiot.\" Blade looked hurt. \"He\u0027s dead, isn\u0027t he?\" \"We\u0027re supposed to bring back the body to collect our bonus,\" I reminded him. \"How\u0027s Beggar supposed to identify the body without the head?\" \"Gimme a break, Charlie. I stayed up all night thinking of this. I got up at five in the morning to suck out all the cream with a straw. Then I shoved in the caps with my thumb and squirted the cream back in.\" He seemed genuinely upset that I didn\u0027t appreciate his genius. Right about then I wished he\u0027d just stuck his knife in the guy. I went into the living room and came back with Rollo\u0027s ugly green drapes. I spread them on the kitchen floor and motioned for Blade to help me lift Rollo. Blade made a sick face. \"But he\u0027s a mess.\" \"You dumb shit. Everybody in the neighborhood heard that Boston cream go off. Somebody\u0027s called the cops for sure. Now shut up and help me wrap Rollo up in the drapes.\" The blood was already soaking through the drapes when we stashed the corpse in the trunk of the Chrysler. I threw the doughnut box in on top of the body. Blade looked like he\u0027d swallowed a bug the whole time. I didn\u0027t see how he made it in this business. I guess everyone has his limit. The police sirens grew in the distance as we pulled out of Rollo\u0027s neighborhood. We zig-zagged around for about twenty minutes before I finally pulled into an Exxon station and told Blade to wait in the car while I made a phone call. \"Who\u0027re you calling?\" asked Blade. \"Just wait here.\" Stan was my boss. Blade\u0027s too. We worked for him, but he rented us out freelance whenever he smelled a buck. That\u0027s when we earned the real cash. I\u0027d been with him for years and never had any reason to question his judgment until now, so I was a bit relieved when he finally picked up the phone after thirteen rings. \"Yeah?\" \"It\u0027s me,\" I said. \"You in a jam?\" \"Right.\" \"Tell me.\" I spilled out the story, Stan snickering the whole time on the other end of the line. \"I don\u0027t see what\u0027s so damn funny.\" \"Just you with that bozo, Sanchez,\" Stan said. \"How\u0027d you guys get paired up in the first place?\" Like he had nothing to do with it. \"Are you going to help or not?\" \"You stay put,\" said Stan. \"I\u0027ll call you back in ten.\" I gave him the number to the phone booth, then hung up just as Blade came and knocked on the glass. \"What now?\" \"We wait,\" I said. \"If you want to be useful, go into the gas station and get us some coffee.\" Blade left, then returned and handed me a Styrofoam cup about the size of a gnat\u0027s jock. \"You couldn\u0027t spring for a large?\" \"It\u0027s just the way you like it,\" said Blade. \"Lots of cream and sugar.\" \"Why the hell would you say that? You\u0027ve never gotten coffee for me before in your life.\" \"I thought you\u0027d like cream and sugar.\" \"Next time, black.\" I poured it on the ground. Blade wrinkled up his face at me like some little kid and stood pouting next to the rental. He folded his arms across his chest and kept an eye on traffic. My hands balled into fists just looking at him. Guys like Blade were why this business wasn\u0027t what it used to be. I dropped in another thirty-five cents and dialed my mother\u0027s number in Winter Park. She answered on the third ring. \"Charlie, don\u0027t tell me you\u0027re calling to postpone again.\" \"Sorry, Ma. I got tangled up.\" \"You work too hard.\" \"Maybe.\" \"When can we expect you? You know Danny really would like to see you.\" \"I know. I want to see you too. And Danny.\" Ma lowered her voice gravely. \"I can\u0027t do a thing with him, Charlie. If your father were still alive-\" \"Danny\u0027s a big boy now.\" \"But you\u0027ll talk to him?\" \"Sure, Ma. I have to go. I\u0027ll call and let you know when I\u0027m coming down.\" I hated to put Ma off like that, but business was business. My little brother Danny would keep for a while. He was a good kid. He wouldn\u0027t push Ma too far. I\u0027d just about talked myself into crossing the street for another cup of coffee when the phone rang. I picked it up. \"Yeah?\" \"Rollo\u0027s ex-wife lives in Sanford.\" Stan\u0027s voice. \"She can identify him.\" \"We don\u0027t need her to identify him. We need the guy who\u0027s paying us to identify him.\" \"Do what I say. You put the grab on her and take her to meet Beggar\u0027s boys. If she sticks up for you that should be good enough.\" \"If you say so.\" This deal was going down the tubes quick. I was used to a certain level of professionalism. Maybe that\u0027s one of the reasons I preferred to work alone. Or maybe I just didn\u0027t like people. I pulled the car off the turnpike and onto I-4, pointing it toward Sanford. We rode through the town in silence, Blade getting fidgety because he hadn\u0027t had a cigarette in a while. Rollo\u0027s ex-wife had an acre of land and a ranch-style house out by the regional airport. We turned down her long driveway and parked close to the house. The shrubs out front were overgrown. Big oaks kept the house in constant shade. \"I hope she don\u0027t have dogs,\" said Blade, scanning the yard. \"I hate it when they have dogs.\" \"I\u0027ll go talk to her,\" I told him. \"You stay here and keep an eye peeled for dogs.\" I knocked, and she answered. Stan had told me that the former Mrs. Kramer\u0027s name was Marcie, thirty-four years young. My eyes took a quick trip up and down her body. She was casual in blue jeans, a Hilton Head T-shirt, and open-toed sandals. She wore her red hair short like a boy\u0027s, and her breasts knocked around heavy and braless under her shirt. Her skin was smooth and bright. It was only around her brown eyes you could tell she had some miles on her. Not so pretty that I felt like a troll standing next to her, but pretty. I said, \"Miss Kramer, I\u0027m Charlie Swift. I don\u0027t know how to say this, but Rollo is dead.\" \"Murdered?\" \"Yes.\" She took me in with those eyes, looked past me to Blade waiting in the car, nodded slowly, her eyes lighting on me again. \"You\u0027re not police.\" \"No.\" \"You killed him and now you want something from me.\" It wasn\u0027t a question. \"Yes.\" Her penetrating brown eyes made it pointless and silly to lie. She nodded, raised an eyebrow. \"Yeah. Knowing Rollo, I thought he\u0027d get it sooner or later. What is it you think I can do for you?\" I was tired from the drive and tired of Blade\u0027s company. I told her I had a proposition for her, and I sent Blade into town with a twenty-dollar bill and instructions to bring back Chinese food for three. He shot me an evil look before climbing behind the wheel of the Chrysler. Usually, I\u0027d have slapped some duct tape over her mouth and shoved her in the backseat of the car, but there was some quality about Marcie I didn\u0027t want to spoil. She had that subtle characteristic which made her seem good without making me seem clumsy or crude. She wasn\u0027t afraid, but she was careful, and I suspected she knew the ropes from being kicked around a lot. Anyhow, I thought she was tough enough to deserve a break, or maybe I just wanted to talk to a pretty woman. Either way, I was glad when she asked me in. She pulled the tabs on two cans of Schlitz, and I sat across from her at her drab Formica-covered table in her dim little kitchen. I told her the story, and she knew how to listen, asking the right questions in the right places. \"I really expected to hear he was dead before this,\" said Marcie. \"The kind of people he ran around with, you know? Anyway, I wished him dead a couple times myself. I haven\u0027t seen an alimony payment in nineteen months.\" \"I might be able to help you with some money, if you\u0027ll help us.\" She smiled. \"I\u0027d have killed the little prick myself if I\u0027d have known he was worth anything dead.\" There\u0027d only been a trace of anger in that remark. Mostly, she was being practical, just another on a list of people who\u0027d figured out the world was better off without Rollo Kramer. That toughness again, but I sensed deep down she had the ability to be soft if she wanted. Or maybe that was just something I wanted to think. Anyhow, I liked her. \"You didn\u0027t seem frightened when I came to the door.\" She shrugged. \"You were going to do what you wanted anyway. I couldn\u0027t see how freaking out would help. You should have seen some of the wild characters Rollo dragged home. At least you seem well-groomed. Clean. When I was with Rollo I used to keep a loaded gun by the door. It\u0027s in a closet someplace, I think.\" \"Why\u0027d you marry a guy like that in the first place?\" \"Young and stupid, the usual story.\" A little smile crept across her face, like she was talking about some dumb kid sister instead of herself. \"Every teenage girl wants to ride off with a young rebel.\" She shook her head. \"It\u0027s horrible and shocking to realize you\u0027re a clich¨¦. I grew up.\" \"So what do you do?\" I sipped my beer. \"I make my money as a taxidermist, but I consider myself an artist.\" \"Isn\u0027t it creepy working with dead things?\" A little smile pushed up the edges of her mouth. \"I don\u0027t know. Is it?\" Blade returned, and over sweet-\u0027n-sour pork, we agreed to cut Marcie in for ten percent if she identified Rollo\u0027s body. \"My brother\u0027s a tattoo artist,\" said Marcie. \"For our wedding present, he gave Rollo and me matching tattoos. They say Rollo Loves Marcie inside of a heart.\" \"Where?\" \"On our butts.\" I raised an eyebrow. \"You too?\" \"I had mine removed. It looks like I sat in acid.\" Too bad. We adjourned to the back of the Chrysler. I opened the trunk and peeled Rollo out of the drapes. Most of the blood had dried, but he was still as headless as ever. \"Oh God.\" Marcie swallowed hard. \"You gonna be okay?\" She nodded. I pulled down Rollo\u0027s slacks just enough to reveal the tattoo. It was bigger than I thought it would be. Marcie\u0027s sudden intake of breath made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I stiffened, realizing I\u0027d leaned too far into the trunk, my back to Marcie and Blade. I got the sickening, dull ache of stupidity in the pit of my stomach. I turned slowly and found myself on the bad end of Blade Sanchez\u0027s 9mm Luger. \"That\u0027s all I needed to see,\" said Blade. \"I guess old Rollo and I will be going now, and I\u0027ll take the whole bonus.\" \"Don\u0027t be a blockhead, Blade. Stan won\u0027t stand for this.\" \"I don\u0027t think so, Mr. Smarty-fuck hired gun. I know something you don\u0027t. Beggar Johnson was in Raiford with Rollo for two years. They were cellmates, so I\u0027m sure he\u0027s seen that cute little tattoo in the shower. Beggar says I can go work for him anytime.\" \"Even so, Blade, this ain\u0027t professional. It\u0027s gonna look bad.\" \"To hell with you.\" Blade quivered and shook the pistol in my face for emphasis. \"You been riding my back since we took this job. You think you\u0027re just the shit, the big-shot trigger-man on the block, huh? So you team with me like I\u0027m some kind of charity case. Well, I\u0027m getting the last laugh. Now give me the car keys, you smug, cigarette-hating, black-coffee-drinking son of a bitch.\" I gave him the keys. Marcie and I stood and watched as Blade tore out of the gravel driveway in the Chrysler. Thank God I always rented under a fake name. Marcie turned to me immediately. \"If I give you the keys to my Volvo so you can go after him, will you cut me in for his half?\" I blinked at her, not quite sure if I\u0027d heard right. She\u0027d just seen her ex-husband\u0027s decapitated body without flinching. Now she wanted me to go after Blade. I liked her a lot. \"Well?\" She jingled the keys in front of me. \"He\u0027s getting away.\" \"Deal.\" \"I\u0027m coming with you.\" Her baby-shit yellow Volvo was about ten years old but in good shape. It didn\u0027t take us long to catch up with Blade. I\u0027d seen him drive once, so I wasn\u0027t surprised he was taking it easy. He didn\u0027t recognize Marcie\u0027s car, so we came up behind him slow. I made like I was passing him, but he recognized me when I pulled alongside. He tried to gun the Chrysler, but I got ahead of him a little and swerved hard into his lane. He went off the road and smacked the rental into a pine tree. I pulled the Volvo over and told Marcie to stay put. Blade was slumped heavily over the steering wheel, a trickle of blood running from his forehead to his chin where he\u0027d bashed his head. I reached in the driver\u0027s side and pushed Blade back in his seat. His eyes blinked open, and he pointed his pistol at me groggily. I said, \"You smell that, Blade? Smoke. You\u0027ve landed in tall, dry grass and your exhaust pipe\u0027s caught it on fire. Give me the gun, and I\u0027ll pull you out.\" While he thought about it, I went around to the passenger side, opened the door and grabbed my National Geographic off the floor. Back around on Blade\u0027s side. \"What\u0027s it going to be?\" He glanced in the rearview mirror, and when he saw the smoke billowing behind the Chrysler, he handed me the Luger. I pulled him behind the Volvo and dropped him on the ground. Rollo was still in the trunk, but before I could go back for the keys, the whole car went up in flames. I walked over to Blade, thought about him pointing his little Kraut gun at me and flushed hot around the ears and up through my cheeks. The smug expression on his moron face when he thought he\u0027d put one over. I squeezed the trigger and put a bullet in his chest. Marcie got out of the Volvo and stood next to me. \"What a mess.\" \"Yeah. You\u0027ll have to pay your brother out of your half,\" I said. \"My brother?\" \"To tattoo Rollo Loves Marcie on Blade\u0027s butt.\" I sized up Blade\u0027s carcass. \"He\u0027s roughly the same build as Rollo.\" She raised her eyebrows in appreciation. \"Okay, but I\u0027m not cutting off his head.\" Right. With no head and a tattoo on Blade\u0027s ass, Beggar wouldn\u0027t notice the switch. I hoped. \"Just help me get him in the trunk before the sheriff comes.\" Marcie sighed as she opened the Volvo\u0027s trunk. \"I just wish we had some plastic or something to put down.\" She rolled up her sleeves and went to work. Good girl. \"Marcie.\" \"Yes?\" I felt suddenly clumsy and foolish. I didn\u0027t like feeling that way, so I hurried ahead to get it over with. \"Maybe when we take care of this, I could take you to dinner? Do something that doesn\u0027t involve dead bodies?\" \"Someplace nice?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Sure.\" She bent, took Blade under the arms. \"Get his legs, will you? This son of a bitch is heavy.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gun-monkeys/page-1.html","bookId":2246,"book":{"id":2246,"title":"Gun Monkeys","description":"Storyline: Charlie Swift just pumped three .38-caliber bullets into a dead polar bear in his taxidermist girlfriend’s garage.
