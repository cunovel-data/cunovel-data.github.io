{"id":85470,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"EIGHTEEN My instinct was to jerk free of the tubes and restraints, but I couldn\u0027t remember the last time an instinct had done me any good. I didn\u0027t have the strength anyway. I pried open my eyes. It didn\u0027t help. Everything was a uniform blur. I blinked a few times, shook my head. My eyesight began to clear. The hospital room took shape around me. I had a tube in my arm and another in my nose. My hands were tied to the railings of the hospital bed. A thick bandage kept my left hand together. The hospital room looked like any other. I was alone. I let my head fall back on the pillow. Marcie came into the room, saw my eyes open, and gasped. \"That\u0027s just typical. I sit in here for five hours, and then you wake up the two minutes I go for a root beer.\" I smiled weakly. \"Hello.\" I was damn glad to see her, and my heart did a little flip-flop. She came closer, sitting on the edge of the bed. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here,\" I said. She smiled, put her hand on my arm. I tugged at the restraints around my wrists. \"Get these off, will you?\" \"The doctor said-\" \"Marcie.\" \"Oh, fine.\" She untied me. I scratched my ear. Relief. \"Don\u0027t pick at it.\" She frowned. \"It itches.\" I\u0027d never have back the chunk of earlobe I\u0027d lost in the warehouse shootout. I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d miss it. But my ear was wrapped awkwardly in gauze, and it itched like hell. She shook her head at my hand. \"That\u0027s a shame. Now your head isn\u0027t symmetrical.\" She touched my wounded hand lightly. \"Hey, do you know what stigmata are?\" \"Something you get in your eye.\" She snorted. I took a look at my hand. Sooner or later, I\u0027d have to take a peek under the bandage, but I wasn\u0027t eager. It seemed to ache in a dull, distant sort of way, and I suddenly understood I must\u0027ve been full of dope, or it would\u0027ve hurt a lot more. No wonder I\u0027d been out cold. I mentioned this with a laugh to Marcie. \"Laugh it up, hotshot,\" said Marcie. \"Painkillers aren\u0027t the only reason. You lost a lot of blood. When your friend called, I checked out of the hotel and drove straight here. You\u0027d already finished surgery. I brought you something to cheer you up.\" She placed a stuffed rodent on the sheet over my chest. It looked at me cross-eyed, its tongue hanging out the side of its mouth. Lunacy. \"You thought a retarded rat would cheer me up?\" \"It\u0027s a chinchilla. And it\u0027s supposed to be whimsical.\" \"Sorry. I love it. Really.\" \"Smartass. At least you\u0027re regaining your senses.\" The memory came flooding back. Jimmy had arranged a doctor, and by the time he\u0027d raced me to the hospital in the moving van, I was out of my head and drenched in my own blood. It was all fuzzy after that, a patchwork of memories involving doctors and nurses and people shining lights in my eyes, people who wanted blood and urine and whatever else they could get. Before I went under, I told Jimmy to call Marcie at the Hilton. \"Baby, thanks for coming.\" Had I said that already? \"Wild horses and all that.\" She ran a finger down the tube that led to my arm. \"Want me to hook this to a bottle of Chivas?\" \"I don\u0027t think I should mix it with the dope.\" I was a little worried. I didn\u0027t handle narcotics well. God knew what I might do or say. She turned serious, not a lot, not too somber. She just altered her tone enough to get my attention. \"You were lucky, Charlie. It\u0027s just your hand. The doctor says you\u0027ll be able to use it again after physical therapy.\" \"Yeah.\" Marcie was too supportive to harass me in my condition, but the look etched on her face said I was a dumbass. Considering the tubes in my nose and arm, I couldn\u0027t really argue. I wanted to tell her again it would all be over soon, but I wasn\u0027t sure even I believed that anymore. This sort of hospital visit had been one of the reasons she\u0027d packed her bags. I mentally vowed to make it all up to her. But at the moment, all I could do was lie there and soak in juice from a tube. I shouldn\u0027t have worried. Marcie was strong in the way that women who\u0027ve been kicked around are strong, and there would come a time when she\u0027d kick my ass for putting her through this. But not now, not while I was flat on my back. She asked, \"Can I get you anything?\" \"Maybe a magazine.\" \"What do you want?\" \"I don\u0027t know. A National Geographic.\" \"You got it. There\u0027s a Books-a-Million near here. Anything else?\" \"I\u0027m okay. Maybe flip on the TV before you leave.\" She flipped on the TV to a shampoo commercial. \"Any particular channel?\" \"I\u0027ll just watch whatever comes on here,\" I said. \"See you later, hon. Try not to freak out the nurses.\" She kissed my forehead and left. The commercial ended, and a show called The View came on. Four mouthy broads started yakking it up. God, help me. At the end of the segment, the announcer said, \"Coming up next: Know your vagina.\" Holy shit. I fished around desperately for the remote control, but it was nowhere in sight. I hit the nurse call button. \"Yes?\" came a crisp voice. \"Drugs,\" I croaked into the intercom. I felt stronger after my nap. A nurse came in with some Tupperware and demanded urine. \"I can\u0027t move,\" I said. I could still feel the painkillers coursing through my veins with giddy potency. \"I hate to ask, but could you put that between my legs?\" Without comment, the nurse pulled back the covers. When she saw the chinchilla perched on my crotch, she half screamed before slapping a hand over her mouth. I giggled like an idiot. \"Hilarious,\" she said, holding out the plastic jug within easy reach. \"I see we\u0027re feeling better. Now how about a specimen?\" \"I don\u0027t feel very productive right now.\" \"I understand,\" she said reasonably. \"I\u0027ll come back with the catheter.\" \"Wait!\" I waved her over. \"Give me the jug. I already got enough tubes sticking in me.\" She handed it over and said she\u0027d be back for it in a little bit. I put it under the sheet and wedged it between my legs. I was feeling some pressure to perform. If I didn\u0027t squeeze out a little high-test... well, I\u0027d rather have another bullet in the other hand. I positioned myself and grunted. Nothing. I grunted harder. More nothing. Jimmy walked in. \"Hey, Charlie-boy. Sheesh! You don\u0027t look so good.\" \"Yeah... I... uhhhh.\" A couple of sad dribbles into the jug. I felt a cold sweat break out over my eyebrows and behind my ears. I was bone dry. Jimmy frowned. \"You want me to call a nurse?\" \"No.\" \"You\u0027re turning all red.\" \"No!\" \"But you look like you\u0027re gonna fucking rupture-\" \"Uhhh. Arhh!\" I got off a couple of good squirts and brought out the jug. The nurse must\u0027ve had her piss-radar on, because that\u0027s when she walked in. I handed her the jug, and she held it up to the light with disdain. Jimmy scooted in next to her, so he could squint at my piss for himself. \"Sheesh, Charlie-boy, if you were a horse, they\u0027d shoot you.\" The nurse swirled it around in the jug, still examining it closely. Jimmy said, \"Sniff the cork, why don\u0027t you?\" She scowled and left. Jimmy shook his head. \"If that\u0027s how you look when you\u0027re taking a leak, I\u0027d hate to be around when you\u0027re dropping a log.\" \"Don\u0027t worry. You\u0027re not invited.\" Jimmy produced a toilet bag from under the bed and dropped it on my lap. \"I thought you\u0027d need a few things. Toothbrush, whatever. Maybe one or two other useful things.\" I unzipped the leather bag and looked in. Jimmy had smuggled in my.38 revolver, and some extra shells rolled around the bottom of the bag. Good. I\u0027d been feeling a little naked. I zipped the bag back up and tucked the whole package under my pillow. \"Thanks, Jimmy.\" \"The rest of your stuff\u0027s in the trunk of Marcie\u0027s car. She\u0027s nice, Charlie. You done good.\" \"Sure.\" He looked at the door, then spoke in a hushed tone. \"We checked you into the hospital as Ian Janus. Marcie thought of the name.\" He shrugged. \"The doctor\u0027s name is Garrity. I had to slip him some big bills, so you owe me, but Stan\u0027s used him before when we needed to keep something on the QT. Our story is you had a mishap with a power tool out in the workshop.\" I nodded. \"Good.\" Doctors and hospitals were required by law to notify the police when anybody stumbled in with a bullet wound. \"We had to grease two of the nurses too,\" said Jimmy. \"I think they\u0027ve worked with the doctor before. Still, you\u0027re not gonna want to stick around here too long.\" \"I\u0027m way ahead of you. As soon as I can walk okay, I\u0027m out of here.\" \"The doc said he\u0027d be along in a few minutes. He should okay you to check out.\" \"Good.\" Jimmy held up a paper sack where I could see it, then set it down next to my bed. We looked at each other a minute. I waited for him to start. \"Like I said, we found it,\" said Jimmy. \"I couldn\u0027t have done it without you.\" I wondered what the hell he was talking about, so I asked, \"What the hell are you talking about?\" He frowned at me, then lowered his voice. \"The stash, Hookman. The cash. I told you. We found it. All of it. The whole enchilada. That\u0027s why Beggar\u0027s men were guarding the place.\" \"What?\" \"You\u0027ve done your part,\" said Jimmy. \"So while you were in surgery, I went back and dumped all the lighters and tennis shoes out of the moving van. All those cardboard boxes were filled with cash. Ones, twenties, fives, hundreds. It\u0027s all mixed up. A big mess, but don\u0027t worry. You rest, and I\u0027ll sort it out.\" I couldn\u0027t believe it. Jimmy\u0027s Flying Dutchman stash of money had been real. But what about Stan? I asked Jimmy if he\u0027d seen anything of the old man. \"Not a clue, buddy. Sorry.\" I\u0027d figured as much. \"Listen, Charlie. I think we need to face reality. Either Stan\u0027s run for the hills a long time ago already or...\" He trailed off. We both knew the other option. \"I need to get back to Jimmy Jr.,\" said Jimmy. \"Maria\u0027s probably drinking all my liquor, and God knows what all\u0027s happened since I been gone. And I got to get some things in order before the shit hits the fan. I just wanted to check in before I split.\" \"I appreciate everything, Jimmy. Get back to your kid.\" He pointed at me and winked again, then was gone. I settled back into my pillow, wondering what to do with myself. My hand was sore, but not quite enough to call the nurse for drugs, although I wanted some. The TV was off. I still couldn\u0027t find the remote control. When the doctor finally showed up, my hand was throbbing so badly, I thought my eyes would pop. The doctor had a nurse in tow- the same one who\u0027d made off with my urine- and he looked at what I presumed was my chart, grunting and wrinkling his brow like he was reading VCR recording instructions. \"Well, well, Mr. Janus, how\u0027s the hand?\" \"Like it should be replaced with a hook.\" \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ll prescribe some painkillers.\" He patted the pockets of his lab coat. \"Nurse, fetch me a prescription pad please.\" She left. \"Listen, are you feeling okay, or what?\" Doctor Garrity\u0027s composure faltered. \"I mean, are you okay to check out? Do you feel up to it?\" \"Yeah. Is there a problem?\" He grimaced. \"Let\u0027s just say next shift will look at things a little closer. We don\u0027t want any hard questions. At least, I don\u0027t.\" \"Right. What about the hand?\" \"You\u0027ll need to get your local doctor to check on it in about a week. Eventually the stitches will have to come out. The ear too. I hope you\u0027ll find somebody that won\u0027t feel the need to call me and follow up.\" \"I know the drill.\" \"I have some things to tell you. To help you get the hand back into shape after it\u0027s healed. It might never be exactly as it used to be, but you\u0027ll get use out of it again.\" Great. He asked, \"Do you need me to call you a taxi after we check you out?\" \"Somebody\u0027s coming to get me.\" I popped two of the painkillers. Marcie pointed her Volvo toward Ma\u0027s house, and I dozed off in about three seconds flat. I woke up when we stopped for gas. I offered to pump. \"I\u0027ll pump it,\" she said. \"You don\u0027t even know what planet you\u0027re on.\" \"I told you I\u0027m not good with drugs.\" It was well after dinner when we arrived at Ma\u0027s house. My car was in the driveway, and Marcie told me Jimmy had arranged it. \"What are we doing here?\" \"Charlie, you said to come here.\" A hint of exasperation. I didn\u0027t remember telling her that, but my hand felt okay. I checked the mail on the way in. There was one envelope. I put it in my jacket pocket for later. \"I\u0027ll get the bags,\" said Marcie. \"Leave them for later.\" We went inside, and I stood there in the hall, looking around and wondering what to do next. Marcie touched my shoulder lightly. \"Charlie?\" \"Go get the hotel room again. Watch out nobody\u0027s following you.\" \"Okay.\" \"I\u0027m going to do some things here.\" \"Oh?\" \"I\u0027ll be along. I just need to tie up some loose ends.\" \"Okay.\" She looked at me funny. \"Are you okay? Can you drive?\" \"Yeah, I\u0027m fine.\" Maybe. She kissed me, and I remembered she was there in time to kiss back and make it convincing. It was hard to listen to her. My head wanted to think about something else. It just wasn\u0027t sure what yet. I stood and watched her pull away in the Volvo, waved. Back in the house, I made coffee and settled into Dad\u0027s chair. The house was dead silent. My hand throbbed a relentless rhythm in time with my heartbeat.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gun-monkeys/page-18.html","bookId":2246,"book":{"id":2246,"title":"Gun Monkeys","description":"Storyline: Charlie Swift just pumped three .38-caliber bullets into a dead polar bear in his taxidermist girlfriend’s garage.
