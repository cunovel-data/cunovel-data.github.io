I told Lou to search him, and he found a cell phone in the kid\u0027s jacket pocket. It was one of those little kind, and Lou flipped it open, saying, \"Kirk to Enterprise.\"\\n\\n I took the cell phone and handed it to Shane. \"Call Benny.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Call your brother.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t-\"\\n\\n I slapped him hard across the face. Tears welled in his eyes.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t give me that shit. You dial him up right now. I\u0027ll tell you what to say.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, okay.\" He dialed.\\n\\n I said, \"Tell him this address. Tell him to come here, you understand? Something went wrong with your drug deal, and you need him to come here. Tell me you understand.\"\\n\\n \"Sure. I understand.\"\\n\\n We waited.\\n\\n \"Hello, Benny?\"\\n\\n I cocked his pistol and put the barrel against Shane\u0027s temple.\\n\\n \"Yeah, it\u0027s me,\" said Shane. \"I need your help. I had some problems with the drop.\"\\n\\n Benny\u0027s voice screeched on the other end, and Shane pulled the phone away from his ear some.\\n\\n \"Take it easy, Benny. No, I can\u0027t go into it right now.\" Shane glanced at me, and I nodded. He gave Benny the address. Shane said, \"Hurry.\"\\n\\n Benny showed up twenty minutes later. I had Lou stand behind the door and open it. I stood out of sight on the other side. We made Shane stand in front of the door about ten feet inside the house where Benny could see him. Shane still favored the bad knee.\\n\\n The door creaked open, and Benny walked in. It never occurred to him for a second he was about to get his head handed to him.\\n\\n \"What the hell\u0027s this?\" Benny asked Shane. \"Somebody forget the light bill?\"\\n\\n He took three more steps in, and I spoke up. \"We\u0027ve been looking all over the place for you, Benny.\"\\n\\n Benny started at my voice, turned to look. His eyes needed a second to adjust, then he saw it was me. \"Oh, hell.\"\\n\\n He made for the door, but one of Lou\u0027s big hands fell on his shoulder.\\n\\n \"Charlie, you got to let me explain. I know it looks bad, me splitting town just when everything\u0027s turning sour, but I can explain, I tell you.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027ll be a time for that,\" I assured him. \"First things first. You know the routine.\"\\n\\n \"Charlie, please.\"\\n\\n I slapped a strip of duct tape over his mouth.\\n\\n We used the rest of the roll to tie Shane to a staircase.\\n\\n I thought maybe I\u0027d tie Benny to a chair, but there wasn\u0027t a single stick of furniture in the house. Lou and I took Benny into the bathroom, because the shower curtain rod was surprisingly sturdy. We tied his hands up to the rod with strips of rag we\u0027d found under the kitchen sink. He looked scared, the blood gone from his face.\\n\\n He worked his mouth behind the tape like he wanted to ask us something, but I shook my head no. Talking would come later. After we softened him up.\\n\\n I worked the ribs for a little while, my knuckles biting hard into Benny\u0027s side. He took the shots with whimpering grunts. I worked my way into a good rhythm, trying not to give any spot particular attention, spreading the punches around his whole torso. I stopped for a few seconds to shed my jacket, handed it to Lou, glimpsed his face. He looked a little sick. He liked to fight, but this wasn\u0027t a fight.\\n\\n Benny cried a little, and I let up.\\n\\n I pulled the tape off with one quick jerk. \"Where\u0027s Stan?\"\\n\\n He drew a wheezing breath, like ice skates on a chalk-board. I turned the shower on him, gave him a blast of cold water. He leaned into it, letting it wash over his face, hanging limply from the curtain rod.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I said. \"Let\u0027s hear it\"\\n\\n \"How much do you want to know?\"\\n\\n \"Start when the Earth cooled, and I\u0027ll tell you when to stop.\"\\n\\n \"It was Beggar Johnson,\" began Benny. The water beaded on his bald head, dripped down and streaked his face, soaked his mustache. \"He came to me with an offer. It wasn\u0027t like I had a choice, Charlie.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s bullshit.\"\\n\\n \"No, Charlie, no bullshit. Really. Beggar said Stan was finished in Orlando. Young blood was coming in to take over the territory. The old man might go soft or he might go hard, but he was going. That\u0027s how Beggar put it. He said my future was in my own hands. If I cooperated, it would go easier for everyone. Geez, Charlie. I mean, well, shit. I got a life, right. What am I supposed to do? Stand up to Beggar Johnson?\"\\n\\n \"You could have come to me or Bob or any of us.\"\\n\\n \"I thought of that. I really did, but Beggar had Sanchez with him. They made it look like the whole team was bailing out, going over to Beggar. I got scared.\"\\n\\n \"You sold out.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not like that.\" Benny tugged at his bindings. \"They\u0027re cutting off the circulation.\"\\n\\n I shook my head, sat on the edge of the tub. \"Stan was good to us, like a dad, Benny.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s more, Charlie.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not going to like it,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Talk.\"\\n\\n \"Stan was...\" Benny shook his head, groping for the words. \"Something was wrong with him, Charlie.\"\\n\\n \"Shut up. What do you know about it?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s a good man, but he wasn\u0027t sharp anymore. He wasn\u0027t all there.\"\\n\\n \"I said shut up.\" My fists balled.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not saying he\u0027s senile... just, I don\u0027t know. Old fashioned. Beggar could see he wasn\u0027t running the show right.\"\\n\\n I got all hot up through my face. I couldn\u0027t see how to tell Benny how wrong he was. I had to make him understand. My teeth clenched. My fists came up.\\n\\n \"My arms. Can you untie-\"\\n\\n \"Ungrateful fuck.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re numb.\"\\n\\n I grabbed a fistful of his shirt, held him so he wouldn\u0027t swing while I was hitting. I started punching again, short jabs with the other fist. One, two, three-\\n\\n \"Wait-\"\\n\\n Six, seven, eight-\\n\\n \"I just want-\"\\n\\n Ten, eleven, twelve-\\n\\n \"My arms. I can\u0027t feel-\"\\n\\n I kept punching, lost count.\\n\\n Benny sobbed, yelled. \"Okay. What do you want? I\u0027ll tell you already.\"\\n\\n I stopped. I was sweating good, nearly punched out. What did I want?\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to get some air,\" said Lou. New Guy looked green and confused.\\n\\n \"You stay,\" I barked. God damn stack of muscles. Couldn\u0027t he stomach to watch a pro work? Lou didn\u0027t argue. I let go of Benny. \"Stan. What happened to him? Where is he?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. For God\u0027s sake, Charlie. I don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"You must want another pasting.\"\\n\\n \"Charlie.\" Lou tugged at my sleeve like some little kid. \"He\u0027s had enough, man. He doesn\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n I swatted him away. \"You listen to me, New Guy. You understand this. Everything was good. Stan did what he did, and we did our job. It was perfect. And when somebody came along to ruin it, this rat bastard didn\u0027t stand up. He didn\u0027t stand up for Stan or for you or for me. He turned on his own, and that\u0027s the unforgivable sin.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a place, Charlie,\" said Benny. \"I heard some talk between Beggar and that killer of his.\"\\n\\n \"Mercury.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. A warehouse in Bithlo, out of the way. I heard them talking about it. I don\u0027t know if Stan\u0027s there, but they were talking about how out of the way it was, like maybe it was a good place to hide something or somebody.\"\\n\\n Benny leaned pathetically against the shower tile. He was covered with sweat and bruises. A little ragged moan crawled out of him.\\n\\n For a second, I felt bad for him and reached for the shower knob to give him another cold bath. Then I thought about Stan, what I would do if I even found him. Everything had been good. Now it was shit. My hand veered toward the hot knob.\\n\\n At first, Benny was grateful. He lapped at the water, let it soak him, run down his chin. But the spray heated quickly. Benny\u0027s eyes got big with realization. And then the hot hit him full on\\n\\n \"Shit! Fucking turn it off.\" He hollered, twitched, tried to twist away from the spray. \"Ow, fucking shit, you\u0027re killing me!\"\\n\\n \"Come on,\" I told Lou.\\n\\n He went out ahead of me. I pulled the bathroom door shut, Benny still yelling for us to come get him. He\u0027d be a little pink, that\u0027s all. The hot water would run out soon, and he\u0027d just be wet and prune-skinned. But his pleas for mercy followed us into the hall.\\n\\n Lou looked at me like I\u0027d just fucked his pet bunny up the ass, but he didn\u0027t say anything. He needed out for a while, so I thought of an errand for him.\\n\\n \"Can you hot-wire a car?\"\\n\\n He nodded. \"I used to do repossessions.\"\\n\\n \"Get us something. They\u0027ll pick us up in two seconds if we go out in the Suburban. I\u0027d like to be out of here before daybreak. Try to be discreet.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\" He looked at the bathroom door then back at me again. \"You going to be okay here, man?\"\\n\\n \"Me? Yeah. I\u0027ll be fine. He\u0027s not going anywhere.\"\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re going to work him over again, do it while I\u0027m gone.\"\\n\\n I waved him away. \"Sure.\"\\n\\n He left out the back.\\n\\n I put my ear to the bathroom door. Benny had shut up his screaming. Probably the water had turned cold, or maybe he\u0027d passed out. I had some thinking to do, so I went outside and sat in the front seat of the Suburban with the window down. I thought about turning on the radio but didn\u0027t want to risk the noise.\\n\\n I closed my eyes, replayed the fiasco at the Laundromat. Shane was a two-bit pusher. He thought I\u0027d been at the Laundromat to make a buy. I looked in the backseat, thinking maybe the paper package had flown out when the door had come off or during one of Lou\u0027s sharp turns. But it was right there on the floor. I grabbed it, tore it open. Three fat kilos of snow-white powder. I took a closer look at the wrappings. The brown paper was a grocery bag from a Piggly Wiggly. The inside layer was the sports section of The Orlando Sentinel.\\n\\n I figured Shane\u0027s band had been ferrying the stuff all around the state. It looked like Benny had gotten little bro in on the act, and I resolved to take Danny\u0027s Buck Rogers gun away from him. We\u0027d have another loud talk about college.\\n\\n I slunk back into the house, back into the bathroom. The water had turned ice cold, and I shut it off. Benny\u0027s weight had bent the curtain rod enough so he could rest his knees against the side of the tub. His eyes were shut, and he maintained a low, steady whine, a whimper. I couldn\u0027t tell if he was dreaming he was in hell or awake for the real thing.\\n\\n I untied his hands, pulled him down. His arms flopped dead to his sides like two sleeves full of Spam. He groaned again. I let him down on the floor, sat down next to him, brushed the wet hair out of his eyes.\\n\\n \"Benny.\"\\n\\n His head rolled toward me without the eyes opening.\\n\\n \"Sorry, Benny.\"\\n\\n His face scrunched. \"It hurts. My ribs.\"\\n\\n \"I know. I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n \"It hurts.\" His voice was a whisper, the hiss of a knife sliding into its sheath.\\n\\n \"Bob\u0027s dead, Benny, and I barely know New Guy. Why didn\u0027t you come to me? I\u0027d have done anything if you\u0027d just come to me.\"\\n\\n \"I tried... I was too scared.\"\\n\\n \"Tell me.\"\\n\\n He coughed, and his whole body wracked. He faded, and I thought he\u0027d gone out on me. \"Benny.\"\\n\\n I exhaled long, rubbed my temples. I must\u0027ve hurt him more than I\u0027d meant. I felt along his ribs, and he sucked breath. I tried with a lighter touch. I might have broken a couple. Maybe a punctured lung, internal bleeding. He was groggy.\\n\\n \"I hit you,\" said Benny. \"I\u0027m sorry. I called Beggar after Bob and I left your mother\u0027s house and told him you were taking the books to Stan, and he said I\u0027d better get them or be sorry.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay.\"\\n\\n \"So I went to your apartment. I waited in the shrubs, and when you came out I hit you.\" He coughed, red flecks on his lips. \"I guess the joke was on me. I grabbed the briefcase, but it was empty.\"\\n\\n \"Just take it easy.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s cold.\" Benny\u0027s eyes were glassy, unfocused.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay.\" I sat on the bathroom floor and pulled his head into my lap. \"It\u0027ll be okay.\"\\n\\n I pinched his nose between thumb and forefinger, put my other hand over his mouth. He went stiff, feebly tried to wiggle free, but there wasn\u0027t much left in him. I felt him give, go slack under my touch, and that was all.\\n\\n I pulled down the drapes in the master bedroom and wrapped him, dragged him to the hall closet, and put him inside on the floor under the shelves. I had to fold him up to make him fit, put him in a sitting position with his knees up to his chest.\\n\\n I took one of the rags we\u0027d used to tie him and wiped the place down, made sure I covered all the fixtures in the bathroom and all the doorknobs. I didn\u0027t want to leave any prints. I circled the house twice, once inside and once out, to make sure we hadn\u0027t left anything.\\n\\n Then I went to Shane. He sat like a shrunken ball up against the stairs. The duct tape was twisted and stretched where he\u0027d tried to pull free. He must\u0027ve heard everything that had happened to his brother. He looked at me like I was the devil. I cocked his pistol, lifted it, aimed it at his forehead. Shane was a loose end. He shook. Tears in his eyes. I felt something hot and wet on my face. Tears there too. Everything had gotten so fucked up. How did it happen?\\n\\n I lowered the pistol.\\n\\n I fetched the package of coke, spilled half of it in front of Shane. \"If you call the police, you\u0027ll have to explain that. If I were you, I\u0027d just get out of here, understand? Keep pulling at that tape, and you\u0027ll get free. Benny was... just business. He screwed up.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t tell if Shane understood or not. It didn\u0027t matter. I went outside and sat on the back steps. The night was cool. I huddled inside my jacket, and the tears came quick and hot down my face. I let it out, put my face in my hands, my shoulders heaving up and down. I was a mess of tears and sweat and snot. I made the low whimpering sound of a wounded animal.\\n\\n An hour later, Lou pulled into the backyard, driving one of those updated Volkswagen Beetles. It was electric green. Lou opened the door, looked like a giant climbing out of a clown car.\\n\\n \"This is what you got?\"\\n\\n \"I figured it was the thing most opposite of a Suburban. Inconspicuous.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a regular James Bond.\"\\n\\n \"I also stole a license plate off a Dodge up on blocks two houses over for when the Bug\u0027s reported stolen.\"\\n\\n \"Good. Help me get the stuff.\"\\n\\n We took everything out of the Suburban and jammed it into the backseat of the Bug. I checked under the Suburban\u0027s seats and went through the whole thing, but it looked like we\u0027d gotten it all. I wiped it down with the rag.\\n\\n \"Anything new?\" Lou asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you on the road.\"\\n\\n \"What about the kid?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been taken care of.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t ask about Benny. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gun-monkeys/page-13.html","bookId":2246,"book":{"id":2246,"title":"Gun Monkeys","description":"Storyline: Charlie Swift just pumped three .38-caliber bullets into a dead polar bear in his taxidermist girlfriend’s garage.
