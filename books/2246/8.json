{"id":85460,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"EIGHT\\n\\n We didn\u0027t seem to be driving in any particular direction.\\n\\n I\u0027d known Detective Sergeant Burt Remington about five years, and he knew me. I was the guy that brought him the fat envelopes full of cash whenever Stan needed a favor from the police department. So it was with reluctance that Burt held open the car door and motioned me into the backseat with the FBI agent.\\n\\n I knew he was an agent just by looking at him, the three-piece gray suit, the haircut, the standard-issue sunglasses all gave him away. He reeked of Harvard or Yale or wherever glossy G-men came from. But if that wasn\u0027t enough, he flipped open his little badge wallet and said, \"I\u0027m Federal Agent Dunn, Mr. Swift. Let\u0027s you and I have a chat.\"\\n\\n Dunn smoked a Pall Mall. Burt drove.\\n\\n \"You mind if I roll down a window?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I mind,\" said Dunn.\\n\\n Hardass.\\n\\n \"Let me fill you in on a few details, Mr. Swift. Are you listening?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m listening.\"\\n\\n \"Good. I\u0027m only going to say this once. I don\u0027t have to say it at all. I\u0027m being nice. We could simply sweep you under the rug if we wanted. Am I clear?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re clear.\"\\n\\n \"Good.\" Dunn rolled the window down just long enough to flick out his cigarette butt. He lit another immediately. I tried to breathe as little as possible.\\n\\n Burt turned his head, talked and drove at the same time. \"I\u0027ve been telling Agent Dunn here that you\u0027re a reasonable sort, Charlie. A good guy.\"\\n\\n \"I appreciate that, Burt.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Swift, your presence jeopardizes an ongoing investigation. That\u0027s all you need to know.\" Dunn puffed hard, blew smoke, not quite at me but close. \"I suggest you go far away while you have the opportunity. We\u0027re interested in bigger fish than you right now, but later on when we\u0027re mopping up, who knows who\u0027ll get caught in the net?\"\\n\\n If Jeffers was using his bank to ship currency offshore for Beggar, no wonder the Feds were watching him. I guessed they didn\u0027t want a two-bit gunman gumming up the works. I was out of my league, but I was never one to scatter just because some pencil-neck said Boo.\\n\\n \"I appreciate your concerns, Agent Dunn.\" This sounded like the right way to talk to his type. \"But I have some responsibilities. I can\u0027t just skip town.\"\\n\\n Burt frowned at me in the rearview mirror. He wanted us all to be pals.\\n\\n Dunn shook his head like he was real disappointed. \"Your loyalty to Stan is admirable but misplaced. He\u0027s all washed up. Orlando\u0027s done with him. It\u0027s done with you too.\"\\n\\n That was probably true, but I had to know. \"Where\u0027s Stan now?\"\\n\\n Dunn raised an eyebrow. \"Well, if you don\u0027t know, I certainly don\u0027t either. If I were Stan, I\u0027d be on the next jet to Costa Rica.\"\\n\\n Could be, I had to admit to myself. Or maybe he was under a parking lot somewhere. A strong possibility, if Beggar got ahold of him. But the fact was not even the Feds were interested in Stan. Like Dunn had said, Stan was washed up, and I was washed up with him.\\n\\n So what the hell was I doing? Looking for a guy who was maybe dead but certainly wasn\u0027t my boss anymore. The monkey cage had burned. The kingdom had fallen, the king banished. I should just empty my safe deposit box and split.\\n\\n Burt drove us back to my car in silence.\\n\\n As I climbed out of the backseat, Dunn said, \"I think we understand each other.\"\\n\\n I nodded. Burt walked me back to my car.\\n\\n \"Sorry about all that, Charlie, but Feds, you know?\" He shrugged. \"My hands were tied.\"\\n\\n \"Forget about it,\" I said. \"But I might call you later. I have some questions.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, Charlie, didn\u0027t you hear the guy? I mean, Stan\u0027s been good to me, but that\u0027s all finished. Game over.\"\\n\\n \"It ain\u0027t game over, Burt. It might be two outs, bottom of the ninth, and I might be swinging a toothpick instead of a Louisville Slugger, but you better remember how you afforded to put Burt Jr. through Stanford.\"\\n\\n I held his gaze just long enough so he\u0027d know I was serious. Then I gave his shoulder a squeeze, softened my tone a little. \"I just need some closure. You answer a few questions, and I\u0027m out of your hair that much sooner.\"\\n\\n He chewed his lip but nodded. \"Sure, Charlie. No promises, but call me. I\u0027ll tell you what I know, which isn\u0027t a whole damn lot.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n I got back in my car and watched Burt and Agent Dunn pull away before I retrieved the tape recorder.\\n\\n I pushed play.\\n\\n Tina: \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n Snorting sounds.\\n\\n Tina: \"I wish you wouldn\u0027t do that. It\u0027s bad for you.\"\\n\\n Jeffers: \"Not now, Tina.\"\\n\\n Shuffling sounds, moving.\\n\\n Jeffers: \"If you\u0027re worried about my health, you should keep people from pushing their way in here and punching me in the face.\"\\n\\n Tina: \"What are you going to do?\"\\n\\n Jeffers: \"I\u0027ve got to call Beggar.\"\\n\\n Tina: \"Why?\"\\n\\n Jeffers: \"I\u0027ve got to tell him something. Do you know what he\u0027ll do? He\u0027ll sic that pet killer of his on me. Mercury.\"\\n\\n Tina: \"Your best protection is to get those books.\"\\n\\n Jeffers (shouting): \"Well for Christ\u0027s sake. Go after Swift. He\u0027s got the damn things. That\u0027s why I pulled the gun on him. Don\u0027t you think I want the books?\"\\n\\n Tina: \"Calm down, Alan. Don\u0027t worry about Swift. I\u0027ll tell Styles to-\"\\n\\n The sound warped, and the tape ground to a halt. The damn batteries had worn down. I smacked the recorder with the palm of my hand but couldn\u0027t bring it back to life. Figures. Just when I needed the thing.\\n\\n First things first. I couldn\u0027t keep driving around with Beggar\u0027s ledger in the back of my car. That was just asking for trouble. I thought about leaving them with Ma or Marcie or Danny, but anyone I gave them to became an instant target.\\n\\n I drove to the airport, parked in the short-term lot.\\n\\n I found a row of lockers in one of the terminals, picked one at random and dropped in a few coins. I stashed the gym bag with the ledgers inside and locked it up tight. I put the locker key on my own key ring, hoping it would blend in. It looked exactly like I was trying to hide an airport locker key on my key ring.\\n\\n I left the airport and headed back toward the city without any clear idea of where I was going. I\u0027d already decided I needed some help but wasn\u0027t sure who to call. Bob was dead, Benny was missing in action, and I\u0027d heard Lou Morgan cash it in over the phone. I\u0027d have to look outside the monkey cage for a friend.\\n\\n I pulled off the Beltway and found a convenience store with a pay phone. I bought a cup of black coffee inside to make change. At the pay phone, I dialed Jimmy the Fix, and he answered after two rings.\\n\\n \"What it is?\"\\n\\n \"Jimmy, it\u0027s Charlie Swift.\"\\n\\n The pause was only a second, but considering my circumstances, it was a lifetime. In that pause, I rehashed my relationship with Jimmy the Fix. We\u0027d always been on good terms, worked together a few times. As one of Stan\u0027s most trusted boys, Jimmy was usually in on the know. I knew he was good people, and I was sure he thought the same of me. But while we were on the same side, we weren\u0027t exactly peers. He was administrative, in on big decisions. He handled a lot of business for Stan. I was a dumb gun monkey that played Monopoly and made people bleed when they got out of line. So there I was in the middle of this eternal pause while Jimmy the Fix decided if I was worth the time of day.\\n\\n When the pause at last ground to a halt, Jimmy said, \"I don\u0027t know where Stan is, Charlie.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry to hear that.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been tough,\" said Jimmy. \"I\u0027m surprised to hear from you. You sound healthy. Good.\"\\n\\n He meant I didn\u0027t sound like I\u0027d been shot dead by hired killers.\\n\\n \"I need some help,\" I said.\\n\\n He tsked on his end. \"I\u0027m in a pretty precarious position here. So far Beggar thinks I might be useful. He\u0027s leaving me alone.\"\\n\\n \"He told you that?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s implied.\"\\n\\n \"Is it?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because I\u0027m not dead,\" said Jimmy heatedly. \"Like I said, I\u0027m surprised to hear from you. Get out of Orlando. Beggar won\u0027t chase you north or west. He just wants all of Stan\u0027s old team out of harm\u0027s way.\"\\n\\n \"But not you, huh?\"\\n\\n \"A guy\u0027s got to survive, Charlie. Why don\u0027t you wise up? If Stan\u0027s alive, he\u0027s hauled ass by now. You should too.\"\\n\\n I gripped the phone tight, barely had my voice in control. I took a deep breath, then started in. \"I want you to listen to me real good, Jimmy. I haven\u0027t done a lot of good things I can be proud of. I\u0027m good with my fists and with a gun, but those aren\u0027t the things that make your ma proud or impress a good woman or win you any community service awards. Okay, I\u0027m not a model citizen, and neither are you. We don\u0027t try to be, and it ain\u0027t profitable anyway. But I got one rule, just one I\u0027ve been faithful to no matter what. I\u0027ve always been good to the people that were good to me. If you don\u0027t have people like that- if you can\u0027t be a person like that- then you\u0027re never going to have a friend or a moment\u0027s rest or a single good night\u0027s sleep as long as you live.\"\\n\\n It was about the best speech I could muster on short notice, but it expressed a whole wad of twisted, churning feelings I\u0027d had thumping around in my gut since this whole ordeal began. This time Jimmy\u0027s pause was deeper and stank of guilt and indecision. I hoped I was pushing Jimmy\u0027s buttons in the right places, that he\u0027d remember all the times Stan had stood by his side when the breaks were against him.\\n\\n \"God damn you, Charlie.\"\\n\\n And I smiled.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" said Jimmy. \"First thing I\u0027m going to do is ask about the rest of that goon squad you play Monopoly with.\"\\n\\n \"What about them?\"\\n\\n \"Are they accounted for?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re dead, if that\u0027s what you mean.\"\\n\\n \"Not all of them.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I admitted. \"I can\u0027t find Benny.\"\\n\\n \"Try harder.\"\\n\\n \"What are you getting at?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll give you a second to think about it,\" said Jimmy.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t need a second. I knew what he meant, and Blade Sanchez\u0027s words came back to me. Blade had said he could go to work for Beggar. Sure. That made sense. Before Beggar took over Stan\u0027s territory, he\u0027d want to get a few guys on the inside.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll call you after I find Benny,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Charlie?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah?\"\\n\\n \"Thanks for reminding me about some things.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re welcome.\"\\n\\n I hung up the phone, got back in my car.\\n\\n I drove. My head buzzed. Too much to think about. Time for a quick recap of my situation.\\n\\n Stan was missing, maybe dead. All my buddies from the monkey cage were dead except for possibly Benny who was maybe a rat. Everyone kept telling me to run, but I had nowhere to go. I had a set of ledgers in an airport locker which could shut down Beggar for life if they fell in the wrong hands. Probably why the Feds were keeping a close eye on Jeffers, who just wanted to shove white powder into his nose and get through the day with as little fuss as possible.\\n\\n In my corner: A fat guy called Jimmy the Fix. My kid brother with his toy gun. Marcie and a house full of dead art. Burt the cop, who might answer a few questions if he felt like it and if the Feds weren\u0027t too far up his ass. Not much of an army.\\n\\n Anything else?\\n\\n Oh, yeah. I was hungry. I pulled into Wendy\u0027s, ordered a burger value meal, biggie-sized it. I ate it too fast, digested poorly. I was pissed off, my stomach sour.\\n\\n I went back to the convenience store, went inside for more change. I had calls to make. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gun-monkeys/page-8.html","bookId":2246,"book":{"id":2246,"title":"Gun Monkeys","description":"Storyline: Charlie Swift just pumped three .38-caliber bullets into a dead polar bear in his taxidermist girlfriend’s garage.
