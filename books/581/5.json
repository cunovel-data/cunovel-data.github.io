{"id":43270,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"`Ay, ay, sir!\u0027 answered two or three; and a rush was made upon the `Admiral Benbow,\u0027 the lantern-bearer following; and then I could see them pause, and hear speeches passed in a lower key, as if they were surprised to find the door open. But the pause was brief, for the blind man again issued his commands. His voice sounded louder and higher, as if he were afire with eagerness and rage.\n `In, in, in!\u0027 he shouted, and cursed them for their delay. Four or five of them obeyed at once, two remaining on the road with the formidable beggar. There was a pause, then a cry of surprise, and then a voice shouting from the house:--\n `Bill\u0027s dead!\u0027\n But the blind man swore at them again for their delay.\n `Search him, some of you shirking lubbers, and the rest of you aloft and get the chest,\u0027 he cried.\n I could hear their feet rattling up our old stairs, so that the house must have shook with it. Promptly afterwards, fresh sounds of astonishment arose; the window of the captain\u0027s room was thrown open with a slam and a jingle of broken glass; and a man leaned out into the moonlight, head and shoulders, and addressed the blind beggar on the road below him.\n `Pew,\u0027 he cried, `they\u0027ve been before us. Someone\u0027s turned the chest out alow and aloft.\u0027\n `Is it there?\u0027 roared Pew.\n `The money\u0027s there.\u0027\n The blind man cursed the money.\n `Flint\u0027s fist, I mean,\u0027 he cried.\n `We don\u0027t see it here nohow,\u0027 returned the man.\n `Here, you below there, is it on Bill?\u0027 cried the blind man again.\n At that, another fellow, probably him who had remained below to search the captain\u0027s body, came to the door of the inn. `Bill\u0027s been overhauled a\u0027ready,\u0027 said he, `nothin\u0027 left.\u0027\n `It\u0027s these people of the inn - it\u0027s that boy. I wish I had put his eyes out!\u0027 cried the blind man, Pew. `They were here no time ago - they had the door bolted when I tried it. Scatter lads, and find \u0027em.\u0027\n `Sure enough, they left their glim here,\u0027 said the fellow from the window.\n `Scatter and find \u0027em! Rout the house out!\u0027 reiterated Pew striking with his stick upon the road.\n Then there followed a great to-do through all our old inn heavy feet pounding to and fro, furniture thrown over, door: kicked in, until the very rocks re-echoed, and the men came out again, one after another, on the road, and declared that we were nowhere to be found. And just then the same whistle that had alarmed my mother and myself over the dead captain\u0027s money was once more clearly audible through the night, but this time twice repeated. I had thought it to be the blind man\u0027s trumpet, so to speak, summoning his crew to the assault; but I now found that it was a signal from the hillside towards the hamlet, and, from its effect upon the buccaneers a signal to warn them of approaching danger.\n `There\u0027s Dirk again,\u0027 said one. `Twice! We\u0027ll have to budge, mates.\u0027\n `Budge, you skulk!\u0027 cried Pew. Dirk was a fool and coward from the first - you wouldn\u0027t mind him. They must be close by; they can\u0027t be far; you have your hands on it Scatter and look for them, dogs! Oh, shiver my soul,\u0027 he cried `if I had eyes!\u0027\n This appeal seemed to produce some effect, for two of the fellows began to look here and there among the lumber, but halfheartedly, I thought, and with half an eye to their own danger all the time, while the rest stood irresolute on the road.\n `You have your hands on thousands, you fools, and you hang a leg! You\u0027d be as rich as kings if you could find it, and you know it\u0027s here, and you stand there skulking. There wasn\u0027t one of you dared face Bill, and I did it - a blind man! And I\u0027m to lose my chance for you! I\u0027m to be a poor, crawling beggar, sponging for rum, when I might be rolling in a coach! If you had the pluck of a weevil in a biscuit you would catch them still.\u0027\n `Hang it, Pew, we\u0027ve got the doubloons!\u0027 grumbled one. `They might have hid the blessed thing,\u0027 said another.\n `Take the Georges, Pew, and don\u0027t stand here squalling.\u0027\n Squalling was the word for it, Pew\u0027s anger rose so high at these objections; till at last, his passion completely taking the upper hand, he struck at them right and left in his blindness, and his stick sounded heavily on more than one.\n These, in their turn, cursed back at the blind miscreant, threatened him in horrid terms, and tried in vain to catch the stick and wrest it from his grasp.\n This quarrel was the saving of us; for while it was still raging, another sound came from the top of the hill on the side of the hamlet - the tramp of horses galloping. Almost at the same time a pistol-shot, flash and report, came from the hedge-side. And that was plainly the last signal of danger; for the buccaneers turned at once and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of them remained but Pew. Him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic or out of revenge for his ill words and blows, I know not; but there he remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping and calling for his comrades. Finally he took the wrong turn, and ran a few steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying:--\n `Johnny, Black Dog, Dirk,\u0027 and other names, `you won\u0027t leave old Pew, mates - not old Pew!\u0027\n Just then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders came in sight in the moonlight, and swept at full gallop down the slope.\n At this Pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for the ditch, into which he rolled. But he was on his feet again in a second, and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the nearest of the coming horses.\n The rider tried to save him, but in vain. Down went Pew with a cry that rang high into the night; and the four hoofs trampled and spurned him and passed by. He fell on his side then gently collapsed upon his face, and moved no more.\n I leaped to my feet and hailed the riders. They were pulling up, at any rate, horrified at the accident; and I soon saw what they were. One, tailing out behind the rest, was a lad this had gone from the hamlet to Dr Livesey\u0027s; the rest were revenue officers, whom he had met by the way, and with whom he had had the intelligence to return at once. Some news of the lugger in Kitt\u0027s Hole had found its way to Supervisor Dance, and set him forth that night in our direction, and to that circumstance my mother and I owe our preservation from death.\n Pew was dead, stone dead. As for my mother, when we had carried her up to the hamlet, a little cold water and salts and that soon brought her back again, and she was none the worse for her terror, though she still continued to deplore the balance of the money. In the meantime the supervisor rode on, as fast as he could, to Kitt\u0027s Hole but his men had to dismount and grope down the dingle leading, and sometimes supporting, their horses, and in continual fear of ambushes; so it was no great matter for surprise that when they got down to the Hole the lugger was already under way, though still close in. He hailed her. A voice replied, telling him to keep out of the moonlight or he would get some lead in him, and at the same time bullet whistled close by his arm. Soon after, the lugger doubled the point and disappeared. Mr Dance stood there as he said, `like a fish out of water,\u0027 and all he could do was to despatch a man to B - to warn the cutter. `And that,\u0027 said he, `is just about as good as nothing. They\u0027ve got off clean, and there\u0027s an end. Only,\u0027 he added, `I\u0027m glad I trod on Master Pew\u0027s corns;\u0027 for by this time he had heard my story.\n I went back with him to the `Admiral Benbow,\u0027 and you cannot imagine a house in such a state of smash; the very clock had been thrown down by these fellows in their furious hunt after my mother and myself; and though nothing had actually been taken away except the captain\u0027s money-bag and a little silver from the till, I could see at once that we were ruined. Mr Dance could make nothing of the scene.\n `They got the money, you say? Well, then, Hawkins, what in fortune were they after? More money, I suppose?\u0027\n `No, sir; not money, I think,\u0027 replied I. `In fact, sir, I believe I have the thing in my breast-pocket; and, to tell you the truth, I should like to get it put in safety.\u0027\n `To be sure, boy; quite right,\u0027 said he. `I\u0027ll take it, if you like.\u0027\n `I thought, perhaps, Dr Livesey--\u0027 I began.\n `Perfectly right,\u0027 he interrupted, very cheerily, `perfectly right - a gentleman and a magistrate. And, now I come to think of it, I might as well ride round there myself and report to him or squire. Master Pew\u0027s dead, when all\u0027s done; not that I regret it, but he\u0027s dead, you see, and people will make it out against an officer of his Majesty\u0027s revenue, if make it out they can. Now, I\u0027ll tell you, Hawkins: if you like, I\u0027ll take you along.\u0027\n I thanked him heartily for the offer, and we walked back to the hamlet where the horses were. By the time I had told mother of my purpose they were all in the saddle.\n `Dogger,\u0027 said Mr Dance, `you have a good horse; take up this lad behind you.\u0027\n As soon as I was mounted, holding on to Dogger\u0027s belt, the supervisor gave the word, and the party struck out at a bouncing trot on the road to Dr Livesey\u0027s house.\n “把门撞开！”他叫嚣着。\n “是，是，先生！”有两三个人呼应着。接着便发动了对“本葆海军上将”旅店的进攻，提灯的人跟了上去。然后我看到他们停了下来，还听见低低的谈话声，似乎他们发现门是开着的而感到惊奇。但是只安静了那么一小会儿，瞎子就又发布命令了。他的声音听起来更大更响了，好像他被欲望和狂怒烧着了一样。\n “进，进，进！”他叫道，一边咒骂他们拖拖拉拉。\n 他们中的四五个人立刻遵命，有两个同那可恶的乞丐留在路上。停息了一阵，接着是一声惊呼，再接下来是从屋子里传出的一声喊叫：\n “比尔死了！”\n 但是瞎子只是又一次地咒骂他们的拖拉。\n “你们这些偷懒的饭桶，留两个人搜他，其余人上楼弄箱子！”他叫道。\n 我能听见他们跑上我们的旧楼梯时咚咚作响的脚步声，那声音震得屋子都快动起来。没多久，又传出一声惊呼；船长房间里的窗户被砰地一声打开了，碎玻璃哗啦地响了一阵。一个人倾斜着身子将脑袋和肩膀伸出到月光下，向站在下面路上的瞎乞丐报告。\n “皮乌，”他喊道，“他们在我们之前来过了。有人把箱子上上下下都翻过了。”\n “东西在吗？”皮乌吼叫道。\n “钱在。”\n 瞎子诅咒钱。\n “我是说弗林特的东西。”他喊道。\n “我们在这里什么都找不到。”那人答道。\n “喂，下边的，它是不是在比尔身上？”瞎子又叫道。\n 听了这话，另一个家伙，可能是留在下面搜查船长身体的人，走到旅店门口，“比尔已经被人彻底搜过了，”他说，“什么也没留下。”\n “一定是旅店里的这些人——一定是那个男孩子。我要抠出他的眼珠子！”瞎子皮乌嚷叫道。“他们刚刚还在这儿——我想弄开门时，他们已经上好了门栓。分头行动，小子们，找到他们。”\n “真的，他们的灯还在这儿。”在窗口的那家伙说。\n “分头去找他们！彻底检查这所房子！”皮乌反复地叫嚣着，用他的棍子敲击着路面。\n 随之而来的便是我们老旅店的一场巨大的骚乱，沉重的脚步声来来去去，咚咚作响，家具扔得遍地都是，门被踢过来踢过去，直到连岩石都发出回声了，这些人才又出来，一个接一个来到路上，然后声称哪儿都没找到我们。就在这时，曾使我和母亲在数死去船长的钱时警醒起来的那个口哨声又一次刺穿了夜空，但这次它重复了两遍。我原以为这是瞎子的号令，是召唤他的船员进击的暗号，可是现在我才发现信号来自山脚下小村子那边，而且，从海盗们对它的反应来看，这是警告他们危险迫近的信号。\n “又是德克，”一个说。“两次！伙计们，我们不得不动动地方了。”\n “动动地方？你这逃兵！”皮乌叫道。“德克从一开始就是个笨蛋和胆小鬼——你们不必理他。他们一定就在跟前，他们走不远，伸手可及。分头去找他们，狗东西！啊，气死我了，”他叫道，“要是我有眼睛！”\n 这呼吁看起来似乎有点作用，因为有两个家伙开始在杂物堆里到处查看了，只不过三心二意的，另一只眼睛一直在留心自身的危险呢，我想。而其余的人都犹豫不决地站在路上。\n “你们伸手就可拿到成千上万的钱，你们这群笨蛋，却在那儿犹犹豫豫！要是你们能找到那东西的话，就会富比王侯，而你们明知道它就在这儿，却站在那里躲躲闪闪。你们中没有一个敢去见比尔，而我做到了——一个瞎子！而我却将因为你们而痛失良机！我将变成个可怜的、爬行的乞丐，讨酒喝，可我本可能坐上四轮马车的！要是你们能有饼于里蛀虫的那点精神的话，你们就可以抓住他们。”\n “去你的，皮乌，我们已经拿到了西班牙金币！”一个嘟囔道。\n “他们可能已经把那好东西藏起来了，”另一个说，“带上些基尼吧，皮乌，别站在这儿骂街了。”\n “骂街”是个恰当的字眼，皮乌的愤怒在这反对声中如火上浇油一般，到最后，他的暴怒完全占了上风，盲目地对他们左右开弓，他的棍子重重地打在不止一个人身上。\n 这些人，轮番地咒骂这个瞎了眼的恶棍，恶言恶语威胁他，还徒劳地试图抓住那个根子，从他的掌握下夺过来。\n 这场争吵救了我们，因为当它还在激烈地进行的时候，从小村子那边的山顶上传来了另一种声音——疾驰的马蹄声。几乎与此同时，一声枪响，从篱笆那边发出一道闪光，报着信号。显然这是对危险的最后警告，因为海盗们立即转身，向四面八方跑开了，一个沿着海湾向海边跑去，一个斜越过小山，如此等等。总之，在不到半分钟的时间里，除了皮乌外一个都不见了。他们抛弃了他，纯粹是因为惊慌，还是因为报复他的恶语和击打，我无从得知；但是他被甩在后面了，在路上一边疯狂地上下敲着，一边摸索、呼唤着他的同伴。最后他转错了方向，从我身边跑过去几步，朝着小村子喊起来：“约翰尼，‘黑狗’，德克，”以及其他的名字，“你们不要丢下老皮乌，伙计们——别丢下老皮乌！”\n 就在这时，马蹄声越过了山顶，四五个骑手在月光下进入了我们的视野，全速冲下了斜坡。\n 听到这个，皮乌方才晓得了他的错误，尖叫着转身直奔水沟，在里面跌了一跤，但他立刻又站了起来，又往前冲，这回可是昏了头，正好撞在奔过来的马头下面。\n 那骑手想挽救他的性命，但是一切枉然，伴随着一声刺破夜空的尖叫，皮乌倒了下去，四只蹄子从他身上踏过去又抛开了他，飞驰而过。他侧身往下倒去，接着轻轻地面朝下趴下，就一动不动了。我一跃而起，向骑手们欢呼。他们勒住了马，无论如何，这突如其来的事件使他们大为惊骇。我很快看清了来人，跟在其余的人后面的一个是从村子出发去找利弗西医生的小伙子，其余的人是税务官员，是他在路上遇到的，他立即机智地请他们一道返回。关于凯特湾的单桅船的一些消息已经传到了行政长官丹斯的耳朵里，因此那晚他朝我们这个方向前来。由于这种情况，我和母亲才幸免于死。\n 皮乌死了，像石头似的僵硬。至于母亲，当我们把她带到小村子后，一点冷水和溴盐之类的东西很快使她清醒过来，她除了受了点惊吓外没啥大事，尽管她仍在懊悔未曾不差分文地把钱拿走。这时，行政长官骑上了马，尽快地向凯特湾赶去；但是他手下的人不得不从马上下来，沿着有树木的深谷摸索着前进，牵着他们的马，有时则贴在马身上，他们惟恐遭遇埋伏哩。所以，当他们到达海湾时，单桅船已经航行到不远的海面上，也就不足为怪了。行政长官向那只船喊话，一个声音回话了，告诉他离月光地儿远些，不然他得挂点彩，与此同时，有一颗子弹唿哨着擦过他的胳膊。很快，单桅船便绕过海岬消失了。丹斯先生站在那儿，就像他说的，“像一条离开水的鱼，”而他所能做的全部就是派一个人到B地去——去向水上缉私艇报警。“而那，”他说，“用处不大，他们已经溜得干干净净了，事情就算了结了。只是，”他补充道，“我很高兴踩到了皮乌老倌儿的鸡眼。”因为这时他已听我讲了事情的经过。\n 我随他一道回到“本葆海军上将”旅店，而你怎么也想像不到一个房子会被毁坏成什么样子；在那些家伙疯狂地搜查我母亲和我本人时，连那座钟都被摔到了地上。尽管除了船长的钱袋和钱柜里的一点银子外，他们再没拿什么东西，我还是一眼看出我们完了。丹斯先生对这个场面感到大惑不解。\n “你说他们拿到钱了？好吧，那么霍金斯，他们还想要什么呢？我猜，是更多的钱吗？”\n “不，先生，不是钱，我想，”我回答道，“事实上，先生，我相信那东西就在我上衣胸前的口袋里，而且跟你讲实话，我希望它能放到个安全的地方。”\n “是这样，孩子，非常正确，”他说，“要是你愿意的话，我来带上它。”\n “我想，也许，利弗西医生——”我开了个话头。\n “相当正确，”他很高兴地打断了我的话，“相当正确——一个绅士和地方法官。现在我想起来了，我最好骑马亲自走一趟，向他或者乡绅报告。皮乌老棺儿已经死了，事既如此，我没啥可惜的，但是，他是死了，你看，只要可能，不知情的人们就会把这事提出来，来反对陛下税务署的官员。现在，跟你讲，霍金斯：要是你愿意的话，我将带你一起去。”\n 我衷心感谢他的邀请，接着我们便走回到马匹所在的小村子。当我将我的打算都告诉给了母亲时，他们已经全都在马鞍上了。\n “道格尔，”丹斯先生说，“你有匹好马，把这小家伙带在你身后。”\n 我上马抓住了道格尔的腰带后，行政长官便下了出发的命令，马队在通向利弗西医生家的道上矫健地疾驰起来。 \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/65/3752.html","bookId":581,"book":{"id":581,"title":"Treasure Island宝岛","description":"简介： Treasure Island is an adventure novel by Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson, narrating a tale of \"pirates and buried gold\".
