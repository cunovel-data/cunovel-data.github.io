Isaac Asimov\u0027s Robot novels chronicle the unlikely partnership between a New York City detective and a humanoid robot who must learn to work together. Detective Elijah Baiey is called to the Spacer world Aurora to solve a bizarre case of roboticide. The prime suspect is a gifted roboticist who had the means, the motive, and the opportunity to commit the crime. There\u0027s only one catch: Baley and his positronic partner, R. Daneel Olivaw, must prove the man innocent. For in a case of political intrigue and love between woman and robot gone tragically wrong, there\u0027s more at stake than simple justice. This time Baley\u0027s career, his life, and Earth\u0027s right to pioneer the Galaxy lie in the delicate balance.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-robots-of-dawn-robot-3.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":19,"category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
