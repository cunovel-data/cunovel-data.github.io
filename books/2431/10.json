{"id":78291,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"40 It was as though a hyperwave drama had come to a halt in a holographic still. None of the robots moved, of course, but neither did Baley and neither did Dr. Vasilia Aliena. Long seconds - abnormally long ones - passed, before Vasilia let out her breath and, very slowly, rose to her feet. Her face had tightened itself into a humorless smile and her voice was low. \"You are saying, Earthman, that I am an accessory in the destruction of the humaniform robot?\" Baley said, \"Something of the sort had occurred to me, Doctor.\" \"Thank you for the thought. The interview is over and you will leave.\" She pointed to the door. Baley said, \"I\u0027m afraid I do not wish to.\" \"I don\u0027t consult your wishes, Earthman.\" \"You must, for how can you make me leave against my wishes?\" \"I have robots who, at my request, will put you out politely but firmly and without hurting anything but your self-esteem - if you have any.\" \"You have but one robot here. I have two that will not allow that to happen.\" \"I have twenty on instant call.\" Baley said, \"Dr. Vasilia, please understand! You were surprised at seeing Daneel. I suspect that, even though you work at the Robotics Institute, where hunianiform robots are the first order of business, you have never actually seen a completed and functioning one. Your robots, therefore, haven\u0027t seen one, either. Now look at Daneel. He looks human. He looks more human than any robot who has ever existed, except for the dead Jander. To your robots, Daneel will surely look human. He will know how to present an order in such a way that they will obey him in preference, perhaps, to you.\" Vasilia said, \"I can, if necessary, summon twenty human beings from within the Institute who will put you out, perhaps with a little damage, and your robots, even Daneel, will not be able to interfere effectively.\" \"How do you intend to call them, since my robots are not going to allow you to move? They have extraordinarily quick reflexes.\" Vasilia showed her teeth in something that could not be called a smile. \"I cannot speak for Daneel, but I\u0027ve known Giskard for most of my life. I don\u0027t think he will do anything to keep me from summoning help and I imagine he will keep Daneel from interfering, too.\" Baley tried to keep his voice from trembling as he skated on ever-thinner ice - and knew it. He said, \"Before you do anything, perhaps you might ask Giskard what he will do if you and I give conificting orders.\" \"Giskard?\" said Vasilia with supreme confidence. Giskard\u0027s eyes turned full on Vasilia and he said, with an odd timbre to his voice, \"Little Miss, I am compelled to protect Mr. Baley. He takes precedence.\" \"Indeed? By whose order? By this Earthman\u0027s? This stranger\u0027s?\" Giskard said, \"By Dr. Han Fastolfe\u0027s order.\" Vasilia\u0027s eyes flashed and she slowly sat down on the stool again. Her hands, resting in her lap, trembled and she said through lips that scarcely moved, \"He\u0027s even taken you away.\" \"If that is not enough, Dr. Vasilia,\" said Daneel, speaking suddenly, of his own accord, \"I, too, would place Partner Elijah\u0027s welfare above yours.\" Vasilia looked at Daneel with bitter curiosity. \"Partner Elijah? Is that what you call him?\" \"Yes, Dr. Vasilia. My choice in this matter - the Earthman over you - arises not only out of Dr. Fastolfe\u0027s instructions, but because the Earthman and I are partners in this investigation and because - \" Daneel paused as though puzzled by what he was about to say, and then said it anyway, \" - we are friends.\" Vasilia said, \"Friends? An Earthman and a humaniform robot? Well, there is a match. Neither quite human.\" Baley said, sharply, \"Nevertheless bound by friendship. Do not, for your own sake, test the force of our - \" Now it was he who paused and, as though to his own surprise, completed the sentence impossibly, \" - love.\" Vasilia turned to Baley. \"What do you want?\" \"Information. I have been called to Aurora - this World of the Dawn - to straighten out an event that does not seem to have an easy explanation, one in which Dr. Fastolfe stands falsely accused, with the possibility, therefore, of terrible consequences for your world and mine. Daneel and Giskard understand this situation well and know that nothing but the First Law at its fullest and most immediate can take precedence over my efforts to solve the mystery. Since they have heard what I have said and know that you might possibly be an accessory to the deed, they understand that they must not allow this interview to end. Therefore, I say again, don\u0027t risk the actions they may be forced to take if you refuse to answer my questions. I have accused you of being an accessory in the murder of Jander Panell. Do you deny that accusation or not? You must answer.\" Vasilia said bitterly, \"I will answer. Never fear! Murder? A robot is put out of commission and that\u0027s murder? Well, I do deny it, murder or whatever! I deny it with all possible force. I have not given Gremionis information on robotics for the purpose of allowing him to put an end to Jander. I don\u0027t know enough to do so and I suspect that no one at the Institute knows enough.\" Baley said, \"I can\u0027t say whether you know enough to have helped commit the crime or whether anyone at the Institute knows enough. We can, however, discuss motive. First, you might have a feeling of tenderness for this Gremionis. However much you might reject his offers - however contemptible you might find him as a possible lover - would it be so strange that you would feel flattered by his persistence, sufficiently so to be willing to help him if he turned to you prayerfully and without any sexual demands with which to annoy you?\" \"You mean he may have come to me and said, \u0027Vasilia, dear, I want to put a robot out of commission. Please tell me how to do it and I will be terribly grateful to you.\u0027 And I would say, \u0027Why, certainly, dear, I would just love to help you commit a crime.\u0027 - Preposterous! No one except an Earthman, who knows nothing of Auroran ways, could believe anything like this could happen. It would take a particularly stupid Earthman, too.\" \"Perhaps, but all possibilities must be considered. For instance, as a second possibility, might you yourself not be jealous over the fact that Gremionis has switched his affections, so that you might help him not out of abstract tenderness but out of a very concrete desire to win him back?\" \"Jealous? That is an Earthly emotion. If I do not wish Gremionis for myself, how can I possibly care whether he offers himself to another woman and she accepts or, for that matter, if another woman offers herself to him and he accepts?\" \"I have been told before that sexual jealousy is unknown on Aurora and I am willing to admit that is true in theory, but such theories rarely hold up in practice. There are surely some exceptions. What\u0027s more, jealousy is all too often an irrational emotion and not to be dismissed by mere logic. Still, let us leave that for the moment. As a third possibility, you might be jealous of Gladia and wish to do her harm, even if you don\u0027t care the least bit for Gremionis yourself.\" \"Jealous of Gladia? I have never even seen her, except once on the hyperwave when she arrived in Aurora. The fact that people have commented on her resemblance to me, every once in a long while, hasn\u0027t bothered me.\" \"Does it perhaps bother you that she is Dr. Fastolfe\u0027s ward, his favorite, almost the daughter that you were once? She has replaced you.\" \"She is welcome to that. I could not care less.\" \"Even if they were lovers?\" Vasilia stared at Baley with growing fury and beads of perspiration appeared at her hairline. She said, \"There is no need to discuss this. You have asked me to deny the allegation that I was accessory to what you call murder and I have denied it. I have said I lacked the ability and I lacked the motive. You are welcome to present your case to all Aurora. Present your foolish attempts at supplying me with a motive. Maintain, if you wish, that I have the ability to do so. You will get nowhere. Absolutely nowhere.\" And even while she trembled with anger, it seemed to Baley that there was conviction in her voice. She did not fear the accusation. She had agreed to see him, so he was on the track of something that she feared - perhaps feared desperately. But she did not fear this. Where, then, had he gone wrong? 41 Baley said (troubled, casting about for some way out), \"Suppose I accept your statement, Dr. Vasilia. Suppose I agree that my suspicion that you might have been an accessory in this - roboticide - was wrong. Even that would not mean that it is impossible for you to help me.\" \"Why should I help you?\" Baley said, \"Out of human decency. Dr. Han Fastolfe assures us he did not do it, that he is not a robot-killer, that he did not put this particular robot, Jander, out of operation. You\u0027ve known Dr. Fastolfe better than anyone ever has, one would suppose. You spent years in an intimate relationship with him as a beloved child and growing daughter. You saw him at times and under conditions that no one else saw him. Whatever your present feelings toward him might be, the past is not changed by them. Knowing him as you do, you must be able to bear witness that his character is such that he could not harm a robot, certainly not a robot that is one of his supreme achievements. Would you be willing to bear such witness openly? To all the worlds? It would help a great deal.\" Vasilia\u0027s face seemed to harden. \"Understand me,\" she said, pronouncing the words distinctly. \"I will not be involved.\" \"You must be involved.\" \"Why?\" \"Do you owe nothing to your father? He is your father. Whether the word means anything to you or not, there is a biological connection. And besides that - father or not - he took care of you, nurtured and brought you up, for years. You owe him something for that.\" Vasilia trembled. It was a visible shaking and her teeth were chattering. She tried to speak, failed, took a deep breath, another, then tried again. She said, \"Giskard, do you hear all that is going on?\" Giskard bowed his head. \"Yes, Little Miss.\" \"And you, the humaniform - Daneel?\" \"Yes, Dr. Vasilia.\" \"You hear all this, too?\" \"Yes, Dr. Vasilia.\" \"You both understand the Earthman insists that I bear evidence on Dr. Fastolfe\u0027s character?\" Both nodded. \"Then I will speak - against my will and in anger. It is because I have felt that I did owe this father of mine some minimum consideration as my gene-bearer and, after a fashion, my upbringer, that I have not borne witness. But now I will. Earthman, listen to me. Dr. Han Fastolfe, some of whose genes I share, did not take care of me - me - me - as a separate, distinct human being. I was to him nothing more than an experiment, an observational phenomenon.\" Baley shook his head. \"That is not what I was asking.\" She drove furiously over him. \"You insisted that I speak and I will speak - and it will answer you. - One thing interests Dr. Han Fastolfe. One thing. One thing only. That is the functioning of the human brain. He wishes to reduce it to equations, to a wiring diagram, to a solved maze, and thus found a mathematical science of human behavior which will allow him to predict the human future. He calls the science \u0027psychohistory.\u0027 I can\u0027t believe that you have talked to him for as little as an hour without his mentioning it. It is the monomania that drives him.\" Vasilia searched Baley\u0027s face and cried out in a fierce joy, \"I can tell! He has talked to you about it. Then he must have told you that he is interested in robots only insofar as they can bring him to the human brain. He is interested in humaniform robots only insofar as they can bring him still closer to the human brain. - Yes, he\u0027s told you that, too. \"The basic theory that made humaniform robots possible arose, I am quite certain, out of his attempt to understand the human brain and he hugs that theory to himself and will allow no one else to see it because he wants to solve the problem of the human brain totally by himself in the two centuries or so he has left. Everything is subordinate to that. And that most certainly included me.\" Baley, trying to breast his way against the flood of fury, said in a low voice, \"In what way did it include you, Dr. Vasilia?\" \"When I was born, I should have been placed with others of my kind, with professionals who knew how to care for infants. I should not have been kept by myself in the charge of an amateur - father or not, scientist or not. Dr. Fastolfe should not have been allowed to subject a child to such an environment and would not - if he had been anyone else but Han Fastolfe. He used all his prestige to bring it about, called in every debt he had, persuaded every key person he could, until he had control of me.\" \"He loved you,\" muttered Baley. \"Loved me? Any other infant would have done as well, but no other infant was available. What he wanted was a growing child in his presence, a developing brain. He wanted to make a careful study of the method of its development, the fashion of its growth. He wanted a human brain in simple form, growing complex, so that he could study it in detail. For that purpose, he subjected me to an abnormal environment and to subtle experimentation, with no consideration for me as a human being at all.\" \"I can\u0027t believe that. Even if he were interested in you as an experimental object, he could still care for you as a human being.\" \"No. You speak as an Earthman. Perhaps on Earth there is some sort of regard for biological connections. Here there is not. I was an experimental object to him. Period.\" \"Even if that were so to start with, Dr. Fastolfe couldn\u0027t help but learn to love you - a helpless object entrusted to his care. Even if there were no biological connection at all, even if you were an animal, let us say, he would have learned to love you.\" \"Oh, would he now?\" she said bitterly. \"You don\u0027t know the force of indifference in a man like Dr. Fastolfe. If it would have advanced his knowledge to snuff out my life, he would have done so without hesitation.\" \"That is ridiculous, Dr. Vasilia. His treatment of you was so kind and considerate that it evoked love from you. I know that. You - you offered yourself to him.\" \"He told you that, did he? Yes, he would. Not for a moment, even today, would he stop to question whether such a revelation might not embarrass me. - Yes, I offered myself to him and why not? He was the only human being I really knew. He was superficially gentle to me and I didn\u0027t understand his true purposes. He was a natural target for me. Then, too, he saw to it that I was introduced to sexual stimulation under controlled conditions - the controls he set up. It was inevitable that eventually I would turn to him. I had to, for there was no one else - and he refused.\" \"And you hated him for that?\" \"No. Not at first. Not for years. Even though my sexual development was stunted and distorted, with effects I feel to this day, I did not blame him. I did not know enough. I found excuses for him. He was busy. He had others. He needed older women. You would be astonished at the ingenuity with which I uncovered reasons for his refusal. It was only years later that I became aware that something was wrong and I managed to bring it out openly, face-to-face. \u0027Why did you refuse me?\u0027 I asked. Obliging me might have put me on the right track, solved everything.\" She paused, swallowing, and for a moment covered her eyes. Baley waited, frozen with embarrassment. The robots were expressionless (incapable, for all Baley knew, of experiencing any balance or imbalance of the positronic pathways that would produce a sensation in any way analogous to human embarrassment). She said, calmer, \"He avoided the question for as long as he could, but I faced him with it over and over. \u0027Why did you refuse me?\u0027 \u0027Why did you refuse me?\u0027 He had no hesitation in engaging in sex. I knew of several occasions - I remember wondering if he simply preferred men. Where children are not involved, personal preference in such things is not of any importance and some men can find women distasteful or, for that matter, vice versa. It was not so with this man you call my father, however. He enjoyed women - sometimes young women - as young as I was when I first offered myself. \u0027Why did you refuse me?\u0027 He finally answered me - and you are welcome to guess what that answer was.\" She paused and waited sardonically. Baley stirred uneasily and said in a mumble, \"He didn\u0027t want to make love to his daughter?\" \"Oh, don\u0027t be a fool. What difference does that make? Considering that hardly any man on Aurora knows who his daughter is, any man making love to any woman a few decades younger might be - But never mind, it\u0027s self-evident. - What he answered - and oh, how I remember the words - was \u0027You great fool! If I involved myself with you in that manner, how could I maintain my objectivity - and of what use would my continuing study of you be?\u0027 \"By that time, you see, I knew of his interest in the human brain. I was even following in his footsteps and becoming a roboticist in my own right. I worked with Giskard in this direction and experimented with his programming. I did it very well, too, didn\u0027t I, Giskard?\" Giskard said, \"So you did, Little Miss.\" \"But I could see that this man whom you call my father did not view me as a human being. He was willing to see me distorted for life, rather than risk his objectivity. His observations meant more to him than my nonnality. From that time on, I knew what I was and what he was - and I left him.\" The silence hung heavy in the air. Baley\u0027s head was throbbing slightly. He wanted to ask: could you not take into account the self-centeredness of a great scientist? The importance of a great problem? Could you make no allowances for something spoken perhaps in irritation at being forced to discuss what one did not want to discuss? Was not Vasilia\u0027s own anger just now much the same thing? Did not Vasilia\u0027s concentration on her own \"normality\" (whatever she meant by that) to the exclusion of perhaps the two most important problems facing humanity - the nature of the human brain and the settling of the Galaxy - represent an equal self�Ccenteredness with much less excuse? But he could ask none of those things. He did not know how to put it so that it would make real sense to this woman, nor was he sure he would understand her if she answered. What was he doing on this world? He could not understand their ways, no matter how they explained. Nor could they understand his. He said wearily, \"I am sorry, Dr. Vasilia. I understand that you are angry, but if you would dismiss your anger for a moment and consider, instead, the matter of Dr. Fastolfe and the murdered robot, could you not see that we are dealing with two different things? Dr. Fastolfe might have wanted to observe you in a detached and objective way, even at the cost of your unhappiness, and yet be light-years removed from the desire to destroy an advanced humaniform robot.\" Vasilia reddened. She shouted, \"Don\u0027t you understand what I\u0027m telling you, Earthman? Do you think I have told you what I have just told you because I think you - or anyone - would be interested in the sad story of my life? For that matter, do you think I enjoy revealing myself in this manner? \"I\u0027m telling you this only to show you that Dr. Han Fastolfe - my biological father, as you never tire of pointing out - did destroy Jander. Of course he did. I have refrained from saying so because no one - until you - was idiot enough to ask me and because of some foolish remnant of consideration I have for that man. But now that you have asked me, I say so and, by Aurora, I will continue to say so - to anyone and everyone. Publicly, if necessary. \"Dr. Han Fastolfe did destroy Jander Panell. I am certain of it. Does that satisfy you?\" 42 Baley stared at the distraught woman in horror. He stuttered and began again. \"I don\u0027t understand at all, Dr. Vasilia. Please quiet down and consider. Why should Dr. Fastolfe destroy the robot? What has that to do with his treatment of you? Do you imagine it is some kind of retaliation against you?\" Vasilia was breathing rapidly (Baley noted absently and without conscious intention that, although Vasilia was as smallboned as Gladia was, her breasts were larger) and she seemed to wrench at her voice to keep it under control. She said, \"I told you, Earthman, did I not, that Han Fastolfe was interested in observing the human brain? He did not hesitate to put it under stress in order to observe the results. And he preferred brains that were out of the ordinary - that of an infant, for instance - so that he might watch their development. Any brain but a commonplace one.\" \"But what has that to do - \" \"Ask yourself, then, why he gained this interest in the foreign woman.\" \"In Gladia? I asked him and he told me. She reminded him of you and the resemblance is indeed distinct.\" \"And when you told me this earlier, I was amused and asked if you believed him? I ask again. Do you believe him?\" \"Why shouldn\u0027t I believe him?\" \"Because it\u0027s not true. The resemblance may have attracted his attention, but the real key to his interest is that the foreign woman is - foreign. She had been brought up in Solaria, under assumptions and social axioms not like those on Aurora. He could therefore study a brain that was differently molded from ours and could gain an interesting perspective. Don\u0027t you understand that? - For that matter, why is he interested in you, Earthman? Is he silly enough to imagine that you can solve an Auroran problem when you know nothing about Aurora?\" Daneel suddenly intervened again and Baley started at the sound of the other\u0027s voice. Daneel said, \"Dr. Vasilia, Partner Elijah solved a problem on Solaria, though he knew nothing of Solaria.\" \"Yes,\" said Vasilia sourly, \"so all the worlds noted on that hyperwave program. And lightning may strike, too, but I don\u0027t think that Han Fastolfe is confident it will strike twice in the same place in rapid succession. No, Earthman, he was attracted to you, in the first place, because you are an Earthman. You possess another alien brain he can study and manipulate.\" \"Surely you cannot believe, Dr. Vasilia, that he would risk matters of vital importance to Aurora and call in someone he knew to be useless, merely to study an unusual brain.\" \"Of course he would. Isn\u0027t that the whole point of what I am telling you? There is no crisis that could face Aurora that he would believe, for a single moment, to be as important as solving the problem of the brain. I can tell you exactly what he would say if you were to ask him. Aurora might rise or fall; flourish or decay, and that would all be of little concern compared to the problem of the brain, for if human beings really understood the brain, all that might have been lost in the course of a millennium of neglect or wrong decisions would be regained in a decade of cleverly directed human development guided by his dream of \u0027psychohistory.\u0027 He would use the same argument to justify anything - lies, cruelty, anything - by merely saying that it is all intended to serve the purpose of advancing the knowledge of the brain.\" \"I can\u0027t imagine that Dr. Fastolfe would be cruel. He is the gentlest of men.\" \"Is he? How long have you been with him?\" Baley said, \"A few hours on Earth three years ago. A day, now, here on Aurora.\" \"A whole day. A whole day. I was with him for thirty years almost constantly and I have followed his career from a distance with some attention ever since. And you have been with him a whole day, Earthman? Well, on that one day, has he done nothing that frightened or humiliated you?\" Baley kept silent. He thought of the sudden attack with the spicer from which Daneel had rescued him; of the Personal that presented him with such difficulty, thanks to its masked nature; the extended walk Outside designed to test his ability to adapt to the open. Vasilia said, \"I see he did. Your face, Earthman, is not quite the mask of disguise you may think it is. Did he threaten you with a Psychic Probe?\" Baley said, \"It was mentioned.\" \"One day - and it was already mentioned. I assume it made you feel uneasy?\" \"It did.\" \"And that there was no reason to mention it?\" \"Oh, but there was,\" said Baley quickly. \"I had said that, for a moment, I had a thought which I then lost and it was certainly legitimate to suggest that a Psychic Probe might help me relocate that thought.\" Vasilia said, \"No, it wasn\u0027t. The Psychic Probe cannot be used with sufficient delicacy of touch for that - and, if it were attempted, the chances would be considerable that there would be permanent brain damage.\" \"Surely not if it were wielded by an expert - by Dr. Fastolfe, for instance.\" \"By him? He doesn\u0027t know one end of the Probe from the other. He is a theoretician, not a technician.\" \"By someone else, then. He did not, in actual fact, specify himself.\" \"No, Earthman. By no one. Think! Think! If the Psychic Probe could be used on human beings safely by anyone, and if Han Fastolfe were so concerned about the problem of the inactivation of the robot, then why didn\u0027t he suggest the Psychic Probe be used on himself?\" \"On himself?\" \"Don\u0027t tell me this hasn\u0027t occurred to you? Any thinking person would come to the conclusion that Fastolfe is guilty. The only point in favor of his innocence is that he himself insists he is innocent. Well, then, why does he not offer to prove his innocence by being psychically probed and showing that no trace of guilt can be dredged up from the recesses of his brain? Has he suggested such a thing, Earthman?\" \"No, he hasn\u0027t. At least, not to me.\" \"Because he knows very well that it is deadly dangerous. Yet he does not hesitate to suggest it in your case, merely to observe how your brain works under pressure, how you react to fright. Or perhaps it occurs to him that, however dangerous the Probe is to you, it may come up with some interesting data for him, as far as the details of your Earth-molded brain are concerned. Tell me, then, isn\u0027t that cruel?\" Baley brushed it aside with a tight gesture of his right arm. \"How does this apply to the actual case - to the roboticide?\" \"The Solarian woman, Gladia, caught my onetime father\u0027s eye. She had an interesting brain - for his purposes. He therefore gave her the robot, Jander, to see what would happen if a woman not raised on Aurora were faced with a robot that seemed human in every particular. He knew that an Auroran woman would very likely make use of the robot for sex immediately and have no trouble doing so. I myself would have some trouble, I admit, because I was not brought up normally, but no ordinary Auroran would. The Solarian woman, on the other hand, would have a great deal of trouble because she was brought up on an extremely robotic world and had unusually rigid mental attitudes toward robots. The difference, you see, might be very instructive to my father, who tried, out of these variations, to build his theory of brain functioning. Han Fastolfe waited half a year for the Solarian woman to get to the point where she could perhaps begin making the first experimental approaches - \" Baley interrupted. \"Your father knew nothing at all about the relationship between Gladia and Jander.\" \"Who told you that, Earthman? My father? Gladia? If the former, he was naturally lying; if the latter, she simply didn\u0027t know, very likely. You may be sure Fastolfe knew what was going on; he had to, for it must have been part of his study of how a human brain was bent under Solarian conditions. \"And then he thought - and I am as sure of this as I would be if I could read his thoughts - what would happen now, at the point where the woman is just beginning to rely on Jander, if, suddenly, without reason, she lost him. He knew what an Auroran woman would do. She would feel some disappointment and then seek out some substitute, but what would a Solarian woman do? So he arranged to put Jander out of commission - \" \"Destroy an immensely valuable robot just to satisfy a trivial curiosity?\" \"Monstrous, isn\u0027t it? But that\u0027s what Han Fastolfe would do. So go back to him, Earthman, and tell him that his little game is over. If the planet, generally, doesn\u0027t believe him to be guilty now, they most certainly will after I have had my say.\" 43 For a long moment, Baley sat there stunned, while Vasilia looked at him with a kind of grim delight, her face looking harsh and totally unlike that of Gladia. There seemed nothing to do - Baley got to his feet, feeling old - much older than his forty-five standard years (a child\u0027s age to these Aurorans). So far everything he had done had led to nothing. To worse than nothing, for at every one of his moves, the ropes seemed to tighten about Fastolfe. He looked upward at the transparent ceiling. The sun was quite high, but perhaps it had passed its zenith, as it was dimmer than ever. Lines of thin clouds obscured it intermittently. Vasilia seemed to become aware of this from his upward glance. Her arm moved on the section of the long bench near which she was sitting and the transparency of the ceiling vanished. At the same time, a brilliant light suffused the room, bearing the same faint orange tinge that the sun itself had. She said, \"I think the interview is over. I shall have no reason to see you again, Earthman - or you me. Perhaps you had better leave Aurora. You have done\" - she smiled humorlessly and said the next words almost savagely - \"my father enough damage, though scarcely as much as he deserves.\" Baley took a step toward the door and his two robots closed in on him. Giskard said in a low voice, \"Are you well, sir?\" Baley shrugged. What was there to answer to that? Vasilia called out, \"Giskard! When Dr. Fastolfe finds he has no further use for you, come join my staff?\" Giskard looked at her calmly. \"If Dr. Fastolfe permits, I will do so, Little Miss.\" Her smile grew warm. \"Please do so, Giskard. I\u0027ve never stopped missing you.\" \"I often think of you, Little Miss.\" Baley turned at the door. \"Dr. Vasilia, would you have a Personal I might use?\" Vasilia\u0027s eyes widened. \"Of course not, Earthman. There are Community Personals here and there at the Institute. Your robots should be able to guide you.\" He stared at her and shook his head. It was not surprising that she wanted no Earthman infecting her rooms and yet it angered him just the same. He said out of anger, rather than out of any rational judgment, \"Dr. Vasilia, I would not, were I you, speak of the guilt of Dr. Fastolfe.\" \"What is there to stop me?\" \"The danger of the general uncovering of your dealings with Gremionis. The danger to you.\" \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous. You have admitted there was no conspiracy between myself and Gremionis.\" \"Not really. I agreed there seemed reason to conclude there was no direct conspiracy between you and Gremionis to destroy Jander. There remains the possibility of an indirect conspiracy.\" \"You are mad. What is an indirect conspiracy?\" \"I am not ready to discuss that in front of Dr. Fastolfe\u0027s robots - unless you insist. And why should you? You know very well what I mean.\" There was no reason why Baley should think she would accept this bluff. It might simply worsen the situation still further. But it didn\u0027t! Vasilia seemed to shrink within herself, frowning. Baley thought: There is then an indirect conspiracy, whatever it might be, and this might hold her till she sees through my bluff.
