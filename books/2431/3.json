This is pure superstition. I have been treated.\"\n Daneel said, \"It is not because of Auroran fears that you are being asked to remain in your cabin, Partner Elijah.\"\n \"No? What other reason?\"\n \"Perhaps you remember that, when we first met on this ship, you asked me my reasons for being sent to escort you. I said it was to give you something familiar as an anchor and to please me. I was then about to tell you the third reason, when Giskard interrupted us with your viewer and viewing material - and thereafter we launched into a discussion of roboticide.\"\n \"And you never told me the third reason. What is it?\"\n \"Why, Partner Elijah, it is merely that I might help protect you.\"\n \"Against what?\"\n \"Unusual passions have been stiffed by the incident, we have agreed to call roboticide. You are being called to Aurora to help demonstrate Dr. Fastolfe\u0027s innocence. And the hyperwave drama - \"\n \"Jehoshaphat, Daneel,\" said Baley in outrage. \"Have they seen that thing on Aurora, too?\"\n \"They have seen it throughout the Spacer worlds, Partner Elijah. It was a most popular program and has made it quite plain that you are a most extraordinary investigator.\"\n \"So that whoever might be behind the roboticide may well have exaggerated fears of what I might accomplish and might therefore risk a great deal to prevent my arrival - or to kill me.\"\n \"Dr. Fastolfe,\" said Daneel calmly, \"is quite convinced that no one is behind the roboticide, since no human being other than himself could have carried it through. It was a purely fortuitous occurrence in Dr. Fastolfe\u0027s view. However, there are those who are trying to capitalize on the occurrence and it would be to their interest to keep you from proving that. For that reason, you must be protected.\"\n Baley took a few hasty steps to one wall of the room and then back to the other, as though to speed his thought processes by physical example. Somehow he did not feel any sense of personal danger.\n He said, \"Daneel, how many humaniform robots are there all together on Aurora?\"\n \"Do you mean now that Jander no longer functions?\"\n \"Yes, now that Jander is dead.\"\n \"One, Partner Elijah.\"\n Baley stared at Daneel in shock. Soundlessly, he mouthed the word: \"One?\"\n Finally, he said, \"Let me understand this, Daneel. You are the only humaniform robot on Aurora?\"\n \"Or on any world, Partner Elijah. I thought you were aware of this. I was the prototype and then Jander was constructed. Since then, Dr. Fastolfe has refused to construct any more and no one else has the skill to do it.\"\n \"But in that case, since of two humaniform robots, one has been killed, does it not occur to Dr. Fastolfe that the remaining humaniform - you, Daneel - might be in danger.\"\n \"He recognizes the possibility. But the chance that the fantastically unlikely occurrence of mental freeze-out would take place a second time is remote. He doesn\u0027t take it seriously. He feels, however, that there might be a chance of other misadventure. That, I think, played some small part in his sending me to Earth to get you. It kept me away from Aurora for a week or so.\"\n \"And you are now as much a prisoner as I am, aren\u0027t you, Daneel?\"\n \"I am a prisoner,\" said Daneel gravely, \"only in the sense, Partner Elijah, that I am expected not to leave this room.\"\n \"In what other sense is one a prisoner?\"\n \"In the sense that the person so restricted in his movements resents the rest fiction. A true imprisonment has the implication of being involuntary. I quite understand the reason for being here and I concur in the necessity.\"\n \"You do,\" grumbled Baley. \"I do not. I am a prisoner in the full sense. And what keeps us safe here, anyway?\"\n \"For one thing, Partner Elijah, Giskard is on duty outside.\"\n \"Is he intelligent enough for the job?\"\n \"He understands his orders entirely. He is rugged and strong and quite realizes the importance of his task.\"\n \"You mean he is prepared to be destroyed to protect the two of us?\"\n \"Yes, of course, just as I am prepared to be destroyed to protect you.\"\n Baley felt abashed. He said, \"You do not resent the situation in which you may be forced to give up your existence for me?\"\n \"It is my programming, Partner Elijah,\" said Daneel in a voice that seemed to soften, \"yet somehow it seems to me that, even were it not for my programming, saving you makes the loss of my own existence seem quite trivial in comparison.\"\n Baley could not resist this. He held out his hand and closed it on Daneel\u0027s with a fierce grip.\n \"Thank you, Partner Daneel, but please do not allow it to happen. I do not wish the loss of your existence. The preservation of my own would be inadequate compensation, it seems to me.\"\n And Baley was amazed to discover that he really meant it. His was faintly horrified to realize that he would be ready to risk his life for a robot. - No, not for a robot. For Daneel.\n 10\n Giskard entered without signaling. Baley had come to accept that. The robot, as his guard, had to be able to come and go as he pleased. And Giskard was only a robot, in Baley\u0027s eyes, however much he might be a \"he\" and however much one did not mention the \"R.\" If Baley were scratching himself, picking his nose, engaged in any messy biological function, it seemed to him that Giskard would be indifferent, nonjudgmental, incapable of reacting in any way, but coldly recording the observation in some inner memory bank.\n It made Giskard simply a piece of mobile furniture and Baley felt no embarrassment in his presence. - Not that Giskard had ever intruded on him at an inconvenient moment, Baley thought idly.\n Giskard brought a small cubicle with him. \"Sir, I suspect that you still wish to observe Aurora from space.\"\n Baley started. No doubt, Daneel had noted Baley\u0027s irritation and had deduced its cause and taken this way of - dealing with it. To have Giskard do it and present it as an idea of his simpleminded own was a touch of delicacy, on Daneel\u0027s part. It would free Baley of the necessity of expressing gratitude. Or so Daneel would think.\n Baley bid, as a matter of fact, been more irritated at being, to his way of thinking, needlessly kept from the view of Aurora than at being kept imprisoned generally. He had been fretting over the loss of the view during the two days since the Jump. - So he turned and said to Daneel, \"Thank you, my friend.\"\n \"It was Giskard\u0027s idea,\" said Daneel.\n \"Yes, of course,\" said Baley with a small smile. \"I thank him, too. What is this, Giskard?\"\n \"It is an astro simulator, sir. It works essentially like a trimensional receiver and is connected to the viewroom. If I might add - \"\n \"Yes?\"\n \"You will not find the view particularly exciting, sir. I would not wish you to be unnecessarily disappointed.\"\n \"I will try not to expect too much, Giskard. In any case, I will not hold you responsible for any disappointment I might feel.\"\n \"Thank you, sir. I must return to my post, but Daneel will be able to help you with the instrument if any problem arises.\"\n He left and Baley turned to Daneel with approval. \"Giskard handled that very well, I thought. He may be a simple model, but he\u0027s well-designed.\"\n \"He, too, is a Fastolfe robot, Partner Elijah. - This astrosimulator is self-contained and self-adjusted. Since it is already focused on Aurora, it is only necessary to touch the control edge. That will put it in operation and you need do nothing, more. Would you care to set it going yourself?\"\n Baley shrugged. \"No need. You may do it.\"\n \"Very well.\"\n Daneel had placed the cubicle upon the table on which Baley had done his book-film viewing.\n \"This,\" he said, indicating a small rectangle in his hand, \"is the control, Partner Elijah. You need only hold it by the edges in this manner and then exert a small inward pressure to turn the mechanism on - and then, another to turn it off.\"\n Daneel pressed the control-edge and Baley shouted in a strangled way.\n Baley had expected the cubicle to light up and to display within itself a holographic representation of a star field. That was not what happened. Instead, Baley found himself in space, in space - with bright, unblinking stars in all directions.\n It lasted for only a moment and then everything was back as it was the room and, within it, Baley, Daneel, and the cubicle.\n \"My regrets, Partner Elijah,\" said Daneel. \"I turned it off as soon as I understood your discomfort. I did not realize you were not prepared for the event.\"\n \"Then prepare me. What happened?\"\n \"The astrosimulator works directly on the visual center of the human brain. There is no way of distinguishing the impression it leaves from three-dimensional reality. It is a comparatively recent device and so far it has been used only for astronomical scenes which are, after all, low in detail.\"\n \"Did you see it, too, Daneel?\"\n \"Yes, but very poorly and without the realism a human being experiences. I see the dim outline of a scene superimposed, upon the still-clear contents of the room, but it has been explained to me that human beings see the scene only. Undoubtedly, when the brains of those such as myself are still more finely tuned and adjusted - \"\n Baley had recovered his equilibrium. \"The point is, Daneel, that I was aware of nothing else. I was not aware of myself. I did not see my hands or sense where they were. I felt as though I were a disembodied spirit or - as I imagine I would feel if I were dead but were consciously existing in some sort of immaterial afterlife.\"\n \"I see now why you would find that rather disturbing.\"\n \"Actually I found it very disturbing.\"\n \"My regrets, Partner Elijah. I shall have Giskard take this away.\"\n \"No. I\u0027m prepared now. Let me have that cube. Will be able to turn it off, even though I am not conscious of the existence of my hands?\"\n \"It will cling to your hand, so that you will not drop it, Partner Elijah. I have been told by Dr. Fastolfe, who has experienced this phenomenon, that the pressure is automatically applied when the human being holding it wills an end. It is an automatic phenomenon based on nerve manipulation, as the vision itself is. At least, that is how it works with Aurorans and I imagine - \"\n \"That Earthmen are sufficiently similar to Aurorans, physiologically, for it to work with us as well. - Very well, give me the control and I will try.\"\n With a slight internal wince, Baley squeezed the control edge and was in space again. He was expecting it this time and, once he found he could breathe without difficulty and did not feel, in any way as though he were immersed in a vacuum, he labored to accept it all as a visual illusion. Breathing rather stertorously (perhaps to convince himself he was actually breathing), he stared about curiously in all directions.\n Suddenly aware he was hearing his breath rasp in his nose, he said, \"Can you hear me, Daneel?\"\n He heard his own voice - a little distant, a little artificial but he heard it.\n And then he heard Daneel\u0027s, different enough to be distinguishable.\n \"Yes, I can,\" said Daneel. \"And you should be able to hear me, Partner Elijah. The visual and kinesthetic senses are interfered - with for the sake of a greater illusion of reality, but the auditory sense remains untouched. Largely so, at any rate.\"\n \"Well, I see only stars - ordinary stars, that is. Aurora has a sun. We are close enough to Aurora, I imagine, to make the star that is its sun considerably brighter than the others.\"\n \"Entirely too bright, Partner Elijah. It is blanked out or you might suffer retinal damage.\"\n \"Then where is the planet Aurora?\"\n \"Do you see the constellation of Orion?\u0027\n \"Yes, I do. - Do you mean we still see the constellations, as we see them in Earth\u0027s sky, as in the City planetarium?\"\n \"Just about. As stellar distances go, we are not far from Earth and the Solar System of which it is part, so that they have the starview in common. Aurora\u0027s sun is known as Tau Ceti on Earth and is only 3.67 parsecs from there. - Now if you\u0027ll imagine a line from Betelgeuse to the middle star of Orion\u0027s belt and continue it for an equal length and, a bit more, the middling-bright star you see is actually the planet Aurora. It will become increasingly unmistakable over the next few days, as we approach it rapidly.\"\n Baley regarded it gravely. It was just a bright star-like object. There was no luminous arrow, going on - and off, pointing to it. There was no carefully lettered inscription arced over it.\n He said, \"Where\u0027s the sun? Earth\u0027s star, I mean.\"\n \"It\u0027s in the constellation Virgo, as seen from Aurora. It is a second magnitude star. Unfortunately, the astrosimulator we have is not property computerized and it would not be easy to point it out to you. It would, in any case, just appear to be a star, quite an ordinary one.\"\n \"Never mind,\" said Baley. \"I am going to turn off this thing now. If I have trouble - help out.\"\n He didn\u0027t have trouble. It flicked off just as he thought of doing so and he sat blinking in the suddenly harsh light of the room.\n It was only then, when he had returned to his normal senses, that it occurred to him that for forty minutes he had seemed to himself to have been out in space, without a protecting wall of any kind, and yet his Earthly agoraphobia had not been activated. He had been perfectly comfortable, once he had, accepted his own nonexistence.\n The thought puzzled him and distracted him from his bookfilm viewing for a while.\n Periodically, he returned to the astrosimulator and took another look at space as seen from a vantage point just outside the spaceship, with himself nowhere present (apparently). Sometimes it was just for a moment, to reassure himself that he was still not made uneasy by the infinite void. Sometimes he found himself lost in the pattern of the stars and he began lazily counting them or forming geometrical figures, rather luxuriating in the ability to do something which, on Earth, he would never have been able to do because the mounting agoraphobic uneasiness, would quickly have overwhelmed everything else.\n Eventually, it grew quite obvious that Aurora was brightening. It soon became easy to detect among the other dots of light, then unmistakable, and finally unavoidable. It began as a tiny sliver of light and, thereafter, it enlarged rapidly and began to show phases.\n It was almost precisely a half-circle of light when Baley became aware of the existence of phases.\n Baley inquired and Daneel said, \"We are approaching from outside the orbital plane, Partner Elijah. Aurora\u0027s South Pole is more or less in the center of its disk, somewhat into the lighted half, It is spring in the Southern Hemisphere.\"\n Baley said, \"According to the material I have been reading, Aurora\u0027s axis is tipped, sixteen degrees.\" He had glanced over the physical description of the planet with insufficient attention in his anxiety to get to the Aurorans, but he remembered that.\n \"Yes, Partner Elijah. Eventually, we will move into orbit about Aurora and the phases will then change rapidly. Aurora revolves more rapidly than Earth does - \"\n \"It has a 22-hour day. Yes.\"\n \"A day of 22.3 traditional hours. The Auroran day is divided into 10 Auroran hours, with each hour divided into 100 Auroran minutes, which are, in turn, divided into 100 Auroran seconds. An Auroran second is thus roughly equal to 0.8 Earth seconds.\"\n \"Is that what the books mean when they refer to metric hours, metric minutes, and so on?\"\n \"Yes. It was difficult to persuade the Aurorans, at first, to abandon the time units to which they were accustomed and both systems - the standard and the metric - were in use. Eventually, of course, the metric won out. At present we speak only of hours, minutes, and seconds, but the decimalized versions are invariably meant. The same system has been adopted throughout the Spacer worlds, even though, on the other worlds, it does not tie in with the natural rotation of the planet. Each planet also uses a local system, of course.\"\n \"As Earth does.\"\n \"Yes, Partner Elijah, but Earth uses only the original standard time units. That inconveniences the Spacer worlds where trade is concerned, but they allow Earth to go its way in this.\"\n \"Not out of friendliness, I imagine. I suspect they wish to emphasize Earth\u0027s difference. How does decimalization fit in with the year? After all, Aurora must have a natural period of revolution about its sun that controls the cycle of its seasons. How is that measured?\"\n Daneel said, \"Aurora revolves about its sun in 373.5 Auroran days or in about 0.95 Earth years. That is not considered a vital matter in chronology. Aurora accepts 30 of its days as equaling a month and 10 months as equaling a metric year. The metric year is equal to about 0.8 seasonal years or about three-quarters of an Earth year. The relationship is different on each world, of course. Ten days is usually referred to as a decimonth. All the Spacer worlds use this system.\"\n \"Surely, there must be some convenient way of following the cycle of the seasons?\"\n \"Each world has its seasonal year, too, but it is little regarded. One can, by computer, convert any day - past or present - into its position in the seasonal year if, for any reason, such information is desired. And this is true on any world, where conversion to and from the local days is also as easily possible. And, of course, Partner Elijah, any robot can do the same and can guide human activity where the seasonal year or local time is relevant. The advantage of metricized units is that it supplies humanity with a unified chronometry that involves little more than decimal point shifts.\"\n It bothered Baley that the books he viewed made none of this clear. But then, - from his own knowledge of Earth\u0027s history, he knew that, at one time, the lunar month had been the key to the calendar and that there had come a time when, for ease, of chronometry, the lunar month came to be ignored and was never missed. Yet if he had given books on Earth to some stranger, that stranger would have very likely found no mention of the lunar month or any historical change in calendars. Dates would have been given without explanation.\n What else would be given without explanation?\n How far could he rely, then, on the knowledge he was gaining? He would have to ask questions constantly, take nothing for granted.\n There would be so many opportunities to miss the obvious, so many chances to misunderstand, so many ways of taking the wrong path.\n 11\n Aurora filled his vision now when he used the astrosimulator and it looked like Earth. (Baley had never seen Earth in the same way, but there had been photographs in astronomy texts and he had seen those.)\n Well, what Baley saw on Aurora were the same cloud patterns, the same glimpse of desert areas, the same large stretches of day and night, the same pattern of twinkling light in the expanse of the night hemisphere as the photographs showed on Earth\u0027s globe.\n Baley watched raptly and thought: What if, for some reason, he had been taken into space, told he was being brought to Aurora, and was in reality being returned to Earth for some reason - for some subtle and insane reason. How could he tell the difference before landing?\n Was there reason to be suspicious? Daneel had carefully told him that the constellations were the same in the sky of both planets, but wouldn\u0027t that be naturally so for planets circling neighboring stars? The gross appearance of both planets from space was identical, but wouldn\u0027t that be expected if both were habitable and comfortably suited to human life?\n Was there any reason, to suppose such a farfetched deception would be played upon him? What purpose would it serve? And yet why shouldn\u0027t it be made to appear farfetched and useless? If there were an obvious reason to do such a thing, he would have seen through it at once.\n Would Daneel be party to such a conspiracy? Surely not, if he were a human being. But he was only a robot; might there not be a way to order him to behave appropriately?\n There was no way of coming to a decision. Baley found himself watching for glimpses of continental outlines that he could recognize as Earthly or as non-Earthly. That would be the telling test - except that it didn\u0027t work.\n The glimpses that came and went hazily through the clouds were of no use to him. He was not sufficiently knowledgeable about Earth\u0027s geography. What he really knew of Earth were its underground Cities, its caves of steel.\n The bits of coastline he saw were unfamiliar to him - whether Aurora or Earth, he did not know.\n Why this uncertainty, anyway? When he had gone to Solaria, he had never doubted his destination; he had never suspected that they might be bringing him back to Earth. - Ah, but then he had gone on a clear-cut mission in which there was reasonable chance for success. Now he felt there was no chance at all.\n Perhaps it was, then, that he wanted to be returned to Earth and was building a false conspiracy in his mind so that he could imagine it possible.\n The uncertainty in his mind had come to have a life of its own. He couldn\u0027t let go. He found himself watching Aurora with an almost mad intensity, unable to come back to the cabin reality.\n Aurora was moving, turning slowly.\n He had watched long enough to see that. While he had been viewing space, everything had seemed motionless, like a painted backdrop, a silent and static pattern, of dots of light, with, later on, a small half-circle included. Was it the motionlessness that had enabled him to be nonagoraphobic?\n But now he could see Aurora moving and he realized that the ship was spiraling down in the final stage before landing. The clouds were bellying upward -\n No, not the clouds; the ship was spiraling downward. The ship was moving. He was moving. He was suddenly aware of his own existence. He was hurtling downward, through the clouds. He was falling, unguarded, through thin air toward solid ground.\n His throat constricted; it was becoming very hard to breathe.\n He told himself desperately: You are enclosed. The walls of the ship are around you.\n But he sensed no walls.\n He thought: Even without considering the walls, you are still enclosed. You are wrapped in skin.\n But he sensed no skin.\n The sensation was worse than simple nakedness - he was an unaccompanied personality, the essence of identity totally uncovered, a living point, a singularity surrounded by an open and infinite world, and he was falling.\n He wanted to close off the vision, contract his fist upon the control-edge, but nothing happened. His nerve-endings had so abnormalized that the automatic contraction at an effort of will did not work. He had no will. Eyes would not close, fist would not contract. He was caught and hypnotized by terror, frightened into immobility.\n All he sensed before him were clouds, white - not, quite white - off-white - a slight golden - orange cast -\n And all turned to gray - and he was drowning. He could not breathe. He struggled desperately to open his clogged throat, to call to - Daneel for help -\n He could make no sound...\n 12\n Baley was breathing as though he had just breasted the tape at the end of a long race. The room was askew and there was a hard surface under his left elbow.\n He realized he was on the floor.\n Giskard was on his knees beside him, his robot\u0027s hand (firm but somewhat cold) closed on Baley\u0027s right fist. The door to the cabin, visible to Baley just beyond Giskard\u0027s shoulder, stood ajar.\n Baley knew, without asking, what had happened. Giskard had seized that helpless, human hand and clenched it upon the control-edge to end the astrosimulation. Otherwise Daneel was there, as well, his face close to Baley\u0027s, with a look on it that might well have been pain.\n He said, \"You said nothing, Partner Elijah. Had I been more quickly aware of your discomfort - \"\n Baley tried to gesture, that he understood that it did not matter. He was still unable to speak.\n The two robots waited until Bailey made a feeble movement to get up. Arms were under him at once, lifting him. He was placed in a chair and the control was gently taken away from him by Giskard.\n Giskard said, \"We will be landing soon. You will have no further need of the astrosimulator, I believe.\"\n Daneel added gravely, \"It would be best to remove it, in any case.\"\n Baley said, \"Wait!\" His voice was a hoarse whisper and he was not sure the word could be made out. He drew a deep breath, cleared his throat feebly, and said again, \"Wait!\" - and then, \"Giskard.\"\n Giskard turned back. \"Sir?\"\n Baley did not speak at once. Now that Giskard knew he was wanted, he would wait a lengthy interval, perhaps indefinitely. Baley tried to gather his scattered wits. Agoraphobia or not, there still remained his uncertainty about their destination. That had existed first and it might well have intensified the agoraphobia.\n He had to find out. Giskard would not lie. A robot could not lie - unless very carefully instructed to do so. And why instruct Giskard? It was Daneel who was his companion, who was to be in his company at all times. If there was lying to be done, that would be Daneel\u0027s job. Giskard was merely a fetcher and carrier, a guard at the door. Surely there was no need to undergo the task of carefully instructing him in the web of lies.\n \"Giskard!\" said Baley, almost normally now.\n \"We are about to land, are we?\"\n \"In a little less than two hours, sir.\"\n That was two metric hours, thought Baley. More than two real hours? Less? It didn\u0027t matter. It would only confuse. Forget it.\n Baley said, as, sharply as he could manage, \"Tell me right now the name of the planet we are about to land on.\"\n A human being, if he had answered at all, would have done so only after a pause - and then with an air of considerable surprise.\n Giskard answered at once, with a flat and uninflected assertion, \"It is Aurora, sir.\"\n \"How do you know?\"\n \"It is our destination. Then, too, it could not be Earth, for instance, since Aurora\u0027s sun, Tau Ceti, is only ninety percent the mass of Earth\u0027s sun. Tau Ceti is a little cooler, therefore, and its light has a distinct orange tinge to fresh and unaccustomed Earth eyes. You may have already seen the characteristic color of Aurora\u0027s sun in the reflection upon the upper surface of the cloud bank. You will certainly see it in the appearance of the landscape - until your eyes grow accustomed to it.\"\n Baley\u0027s eyes left Giskard\u0027s impassive face. He had noticed the color difference, Baley thought, and had attached no importance to it. A bad effort.\n \"You may go, Giskard.\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n Baley turned bitterly to Daneel. \"I\u0027ve made a fool of myself, Daneel.\"\n \"I gather you wondered if perhaps we were deceiving you and taking you somewhere that was not Aurora. Did you have a reason for suspecting this, Partner Elijah?\"\n \"None. It may have been the result of the uneasiness that arose from subliminal agoraphobia. Staring at seemingly motionless space, I felt no perceptible illness, but it may have lain just under the surface, creating a gathering uneasiness.\"\n \"The fault was ours, Partner Elijah. Knowing of your dislike for open spaces, it was wrong to subject you to astrosimulation or, having done so, to subject you to no closer supervision.\"\n Baley shook his head in annoyance. \"Don\u0027t say that, Daneel. I have supervision enough. The question in my mind is how closely I am to be supervised on Aurora itself.\"\n Daneel said, \"Partner Elijah, it seems to me it will be difficult to allow you free access to Aurora and Aurorans.\"\n \"That is just what I must be allowed, nevertheless. If I\u0027m to get to the truth of this case of roboticide, I must be free to seek information directly on the site - and from the people involved.\"\n Baley was, by now, feeling quite himself though a bit weary. Embarrassingly enough, the intense experience he had passed through left him with a keen desire for a pipe of tobacco something he thought he had done away with altogether better than a year before. He could feel the taste and odor of the tobacco smoke making its way through his throat and nose.\n He would, he knew, have to make do with the memory. On Aurora, he would on no account be allowed to smoke. There was no tobacco on any of the Spacer worlds and, if he had had any on him to begin with, it would have been removed and destroyed.\n Daneel said, \"Partner Elijah, this must be discussed with Dr. Fastolfe once we land. I have no power to make any decisions in this matter.\"\n \"I\u0027m aware of that, Daneel, but how do I speak to Fastolfe? Through the equivalent of an astrosimulator? With controls in my hand?\"\n \"Not at all, Partner Elijah. You will speak face-to-face. He plans - to meet you at the spaceport.\"\n 13\n Baley listened for the noises of landing. He did not know what they might be, of course. He did not know the mechanism of the ship, how many men and women it carried, what they would have to do in the process of landing, what in the way of noise would be involved.\n Shouts? Rumbles? A dilla vibration?\n He heard nothing.\n Daneel said, \"You seem to be under tension, Partner Elijah. I would prefer that you did not wait to tell me of any discomfort you might feel. I must help you at the very moment you are, for any reason, unhappy.\"\n There was a faint stress on the word \"must.\"\n Baley thought absently: The First Law drives him. He surely suffered as much in his way as I suffered in mine when I collapsed and he did not foresee it in time. A forbidden imbalance of positronic potentials may have no meaning to me, but it may, produce in him the - same discomfort and the same reaction as acute pain would to me.\n He thought further: How can I tell what exists inside the pseudoskin and pseudoconsciousness of a robot, any more than Daneel can tell what exists inside me.\n And then, feeling remorse at having thought of Daneel as a robot, Baley looked into the other\u0027s gentle eyes (when did he start thinking of their expression as gentle?) and said, \"I would tell you of any discomfort at once. There is none. I am merely trying to hear any noise that might tell me of the progress of the landing procedure, Partner Daneel.\"\n \"Thank you, Partner Elijah,\" said Daneel gravely. He bowed his head slightly and went on, \"There should be no discomfort n the landing. You will feel acceleration, but that will be minimal, for this room will yield, to a certain extent, in the direction of the acceleration. The temperature may go up, but not more than two degrees Celsius. As for sonic effects, there may be a low hiss as we pass through the thickening atmosphere. Will any of this disturb you?\"\n \"It shouldn\u0027t. What does disturb me is not being free to participate in the landing. I would like to know about such things. I do not want to be imprisoned and to be kept from the experience.\"\n \"You have already discovered, Partner Elijah, that the nature of the experience does not suit your temperament.\"\n \"And how am I to get over that, Daneel?\" he said strenuously. \"That is not enough reason to keep me ficie!\"\n \"Partner Elijah, I have already explained that you are kept here for your own safety.\"\n Baley shook his head in clear disgust. \"I have thought of that and I say it\u0027s nonsense. My chances of straightening out this mess are so small, with all the restrictions being placed on me and with the difficulty I will have in understanding anything about Aurora, that I - don\u0027t think anyone in his right mind would bother to take the trouble to try to stop me. And if they did, why bother attacking me personally? Why not sabotage the ship? If we imagine ourselves to be facing noholds-barred villains, they should find a ship - and the people aboard it - and you and Giskard - and myself, of course - to be a small price to pay.\"\n \"This has, in point of fact, been considered, Partner Elijah. The ship has been carefully studied. Any signs of sabotage would be detected.\"\n \"Are you sure? One hundred percent certain?\"\n \"Nothing of this sort can be absolutely certain. Giskard and I were comfortable, however, with the thought that the certainty was quite high and that we might proceed with minimal expectation of disaster.\"\n \"And if you were wrong?\"\n Something like a small sign of spasm crossed Daneel\u0027s face, as though he were being asked to consider something that interfered with the smooth working of the positronic pathways in his brain. He said, \"But we have not been wrong.\"\n \"You cannot say that. We are approaching the landing and that is sure to be the danger moment. In fact, at this point there is no need to sabotage the ship. My personal danger is greatest now - right now. I can\u0027t hide in this room if I\u0027m to disembark at Aurora. I will have to pass through the ship and be within reach of others. Have you taken precautions to keep the landing safe?\" (He was being petty-striking out at Daneel needlessly because he was chafing at his long imprisonment - and at the indignity of his moment of collapse.)\n But Daneel said calmly, \"We have, Partner Elijah. And, incidentally, we have landed. We are now resting on the surface of Aurora.\"\n For a moment, Baley was bewildered. He looked around wildly, but of course there was nothing to see but an enclosing room. He had felt and heard nothing of what Daneel had described. None of the acceleration, or heat, or wind whistle. - Or had Daneel deliberately brought up the matter of his personal danger once again, in order to make sure he would not think of other unsettling - but minor - matters.\n Baley said, \"And yet there\u0027s still the matter of getting off the ship. How do I do that without being vulnerable to possible enemies?\"\n Daneel walked to one wall and touched a spot upon it. The wall promptly split in two, the two halves moving apart. Baley found himself looking into a long cylinder, a tunnel.\n Giskard had entered the room at that moment from the other side and said, \"Sir, the three of us will move through the exit tube. Others have it under observation from without. At the other end of the tube, Dr. Fastolfe is waiting.\"\n \"We have taken every precaution,\" said Daneel.\n Baley muttered, \"My apologies, Daneel - Giskard.\" He moved into the exit tube somberly. Every effort to assure that precautions had been taken also assured him that those precautions were thought necessary.\n Baley liked to think he was no coward, but he was on a strange planet, with no way of telling friend from enemy, with no way of taking comfort in anything familiar (except, of course, Daneel). At crucial moments, he thought with a shiver, he would be without enclosure to warm him and to give him relief. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-robots-of-dawn-robot-3/page-3.html","bookId":2431,"book":{"id":2431,"title":"The Robots of Dawn (Robot #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Robots of Dawn (Robot #3) \n A millennium into the future two advances have altered the course of human history: the colonization of the Galaxy and the creation of the positronic brain.
