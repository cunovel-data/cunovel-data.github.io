{"id":39534,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO THE LAST TRICK","content":"IT WAS two days later. Felix Leiter was weaving the black Studillac fast through the lanes of dawdling traffic on the Triborough bridge. There was plenty of time to catch Bond\u0027s plane, the evening BOAC Monarch to London, but Leiter enjoyed shaking up Bond\u0027s low opinion of American cars. Now the steel hook that he used for a right hand banged the gear lever into second and the low black car leapt for a narrow space between a giant refrigerator truck and a mooning Oldsmobile whose rear window was almost obscured by holiday stickers. Bond\u0027s body jerked back with the kick of the 300 b.h.p. and his teeth snapped shut. When the manoeuvre was completed, and the angry hooting had vanished behind them, Bond said mildly, \u0027It\u0027s time you graduated out of the Kiddi-car class and bought yourself an express carriage. You want to get cracking. This pedalling along ages one. One of these days you\u0027ll stop moving altogether and when you stop moving is when you start to die.\u0027 Leiter laughed. He said, \u0027See that green light ahead? Bet I can make it before it goes red.\u0027 The car leapt forward as if it had been kicked. There was a brief hiatus in Bond\u0027s life, an impression of snipe-like flight and of a steel wall of cars that someone parted before the whiplash of Leiter\u0027s triple klaxons, a hundred yards when the speedometer touched ninety and they were across the lights and cruising genteelly along in the centre lane. Bond said calmly, \u0027You meet the wrong traffic cop arid that Pinkerton card of yours won\u0027t be good enough. It isn\u0027t so much that you drive slowly, it\u0027s holding back the cars behind they\u0027ll book you for. The sort of car you need is a nice elderly Rolls Royce Silver Ghost with big plate-glass windows so you can enjoy the beauties of nature\u0027 - Bond gestured towards a huge automobile junk heap on their right. \u0027Maximum fifty and it can stop and even go backwards if you want to. Bulb horn. Suit your sedate style. Matter of fact there should be one on the market soon - Goldfinger\u0027s. And by the same token, what the hell\u0027s happened to Goldfinger? Haven\u0027t they caught up with him yet?\u0027 Leiter glanced at his watch and edged into the outside lane. He brought the car down to forty. He said seriously, \u0027Tell you the truth, we\u0027re all a bit worried. The papers are needling us, or rather Edgar Hoover\u0027s crowd, like hell. First they had a gripe at the security clamp-down on you. We couldn\u0027t tell them that wasn\u0027t our fault and that someone in London, an old limey called M, had insisted on it. So they\u0027re getting their own back. Say we\u0027re dragging our feet and so forth. And I\u0027m telling you, James\u0027 - Leiter\u0027s voice was glum, apologetic - \u0027we just haven\u0027t a clue. They caught up with the diesel. Goldfinger had fixed the controls at thirty and had let it run on down the line. Somewhere he and the Korean had got off and probably this Galore girl and the four hoods as well because they\u0027ve vanished too. We found his truck con voy, of course, waiting on the east-bound highway out of Elizabethville. But never a driver, most probably scattered, but somewhere there\u0027s Goldfinger and a pretty tough team hiding up. They didn\u0027t get to the Sverdlovsk cruiser at Norfolk. We had a plain-clothes guard scattered round the docks and they report that she sailed to schedule without any strangers going aboard. Not a cat\u0027s been near that warehouse on East River and no one\u0027s shown at Idlewild or the frontiers - Mexico and Canada. For my money, that Jed Midnight has somehow got them out to Cuba. If they\u0027d taken two or three trucks from the convoy and driven like hell they could have got down to Florida, somewhere like Daytona Beach, by the early hours of D + l. And Midnight\u0027s darn well organized down there. The Coast Guards and the Air Force have put out all they\u0027ve got, but nothing\u0027s shown yet. But they could have hidden up during the day and got over to Cuba during the night. It\u0027s got everybody worried as hell and it\u0027s no help that the President\u0027s hopping mad.\u0027 Bond had spent the previous day in Washington treading the thickest, richest red carpet. There had been speeches at the Bureau of the Mint, a big brass lunch at the Pentagon, an embarrassing quarter of an hour with the President, and the rest of the day had been hard work with a team of stenographers in Edgar Hoover\u0027s suite of offices with a colleague of Bond\u0027s from Station A sitting in. At the end of that, there had been a brisk quarter of an hour\u0027s talk with M on the Embassy transatlantic scrambler. M had told him what had been happening on the European end of the case. As Bond had expected, Goldfinger\u0027s cable to Universal Export had been treated as emergency. The factories at Reculver and Coppet had been searched and extra evidence of the gold smuggling racket had been found. The Indian Government had been warned about the Mecca plane that was already en route for Bombay and that end of the operation was on the way to being cleaned up. The Swiss Special Brigade had quickly found Bond\u0027s car and had got on to the route by which Bond and the girl had been taken to America, but there, at Idlewild, the FBI had lost the scent. M seemed pleased with the way Bond had handled Operation Grand Slam, but he said the Bank of England were worrying him about Goldfinger\u0027s twenty million pounds in gold. Goldfinger had assembled all this at the Paragon Safe Deposit Co in New York but had withdrawn it on D-l. He and his men had driven it away in a covered truck. The Bank of England had ready an Order in Council to impound the gold when it was found and there would then be a case to prove that it had been smuggled out of England, or at least that it was originally smuggled gold whose value had been increased by various doubtful means. But this was now being handled by the US Treasury and the FBI and, since M had no jurisdiction in America, Bond had better come home at once and help tidy things up. Oh yes - at the end of the conversation M\u0027s voice had sounded gruff - there had been a very kind request to the PM that Bond should be allowed to accept the American Medal of Merit. Of course M had had to explain via the PM that the Service didn\u0027t go in for those sort of things-particularly from foreign countries, however friendly they were. Too bad, but M knew that this was what Bond would have expected. He knew the rules. Bond had said yes of course and thank you very much and he\u0027d take the next plane home. Now,, as they motored quietly down the Van Wyck Expressway, Bond was feeling vaguely dissatisfied. He didn\u0027t like leaving ragged ends to a case. None of the big gangsters had been put in the bag and he had failed in the two tasks he had been given, to get Goldfinger and get Goldfinger\u0027s bullion. It was nothing but a miracle that Operation Grand Slam had been broken. It had been two days before the Beechcraft had been serviced and the cleaner who found the note had got to Pinkerton\u0027s only half an hour before Leiter was due to go off to the Coast on a big racing scandal. But then Leiter had really got cracking - to his chief, then to the FBI and the Pentagon. The FBI\u0027s knowledge of Bond\u0027s record, plus contact with M through the Central Intelligence Agency, had been enough to get the whole case up to the President within an hour. After that it had just been a case of building up the gigantic bluff in which all the inhabitants of Fort Knox had participated in one way or another. The two \u0027Japanese\u0027 had been taken easily enough and it was confirmed by Chemical Warfare that the three pints of GB carried as gin in their briefcases would have been enough to slay the entire population of Fort Knox. The two men had been quickly and forcibly grilled into explaining the form of the all clear cable to Goldfinger. The cable had been sent. Then the Army had declared emergency. Road and rail and air blocks had turned back all traffic to the Fort Knox area with the exception of the gangster convoys which had not been hindered. The rest was play-acting right down to the pink froth and the squalling babies which it was thought would add nice touches of verisimilitude. Yes, it had all been very satisfactory so far as Washington was concerned, but what about the English end? Who in America cared about the Bank of England\u0027s gold? Who cared that two English girls had been murdered in the course of this business? Who really minded that Goldfinger was still at liberty now that America\u0027s bullion was safe again? They idled across the drab plain of Idlewild, past the ten-million-dollar steel and cement skeletons that would one day be an adult airport, and pulled up outside the makeshift huddle of concrete boxes that Bond knew so well. Already the well mannered iron voices were reaching out to them. \u0027Pan American World Airways announces the departure of its President Flight PA 100\u0027, \u0027Transworld Airways calling Captain Murphy. Captain Murphy, please.\u0027 And the pear-shaped vowels and fluted diction of BOAC, \u0027BOAC announces the arrival of its Bermudan Flight BA 491. Passengers will be disembarking at gate number neyne.\u0027 Bond took his bag and said goodbye to Leiter. He said, \u0027Well, thanks for everything, Felix. Write to me every day.\u0027 Leiter gripped his hand hard. He said, \u0027Sure thing, kid. And take it easy. Tell that old bastard M to send you back over soon. Next visit we\u0027ll take some time off from the razzmatazz. Time you called in on my home state. Like to have you meet my oil-well. \u0027Bye now.\u0027 Leiter got into his car and accelerated away from the arrival bay. Bond raised his hand. The Studillac dry-skidded out on to the approach road. There was an answering glint from Leiter\u0027s steel hook out of the window and he was gone. Bond sighed. He picked up his bag and walked in and over to the BOAC ticket counter. Bond didn\u0027t mind airports so long as he was alone in them. He had half an hour to wait and he was quite content to wander through the milling crowds, have a bourbon and soda at the restaurant and spend some time choosing something to read at the bookstore. He bought Ben Hogan\u0027s Modern Fundamentals of Golf and the latest Raymond Chandler and \"sauntered along to the Souvenir Shop to see if he could find an amusing gimmick to take back to his secretary. Now there was a man\u0027s voice on the BOAC announcing system. It called out a long list of Monarch passengers who were required at the ticket counter. Ten minutes later Bond was paying for one of the latest and most expensive ballpoint pens when he heard his own name being called. \u0027Will Mr James Bond, passenger on BOAC Monarch flight No 510 to Gander and London, please come to the BOAC ticket counter. Mr James Bond, please.\u0027 It was obviously that infernal tax form to show how much he had earned during his stay in America. On principle Bond never went to the Internal Revenue Office in New York to get clearance and he had only once had to argue it out at Idlewild. He went out of the shop and across to the BOAC counter. The official said politely, \u0027May I see your health certificate, please, Mr Bond?\u0027 Bond took the form out of his passport and handed it over. The man looked at it carefully. He said, \u0027I\u0027m very sorry, sir, but there\u0027s \"been a typhoid case at Gander and they\u0027re insisting that all transit passengers who haven\u0027t had their shots in the last six months should be topped up. It\u0027s most annoying, sir, but Gander\u0027s very touchy about these things. Too bad we couldn\u0027t have managed a direct flight, but there\u0027s a strong head-wind.\u0027 Bond hated inoculations. He said irritably, \u0027But look here, I\u0027m stuffed with shots of one kind or another. Been having them for twenty years for one damned thing or another!\u0027 He looked round. The area near the BOAC departure gate seemed curiously deserted. He said, \u0027What about the other passengers? Where are they?\u0027 \u0027They\u0027ve all agreed, sir. Just having their shots now. It won\u0027t take a minute, sir, if you\u0027ll come this way.\u0027 \u0027Oh well.\u0027 Bond shrugged his shoulders impatiently. He followed the man behind the counter and through a door to the BOAC station manager\u0027s office. There was the usual white-clothed doctor, a mask over the bottom of his face, the needle held ready. \u0027Last one?\u0027 he asked of the BOAC official. \u0027Yes, Doctor.\u0027 \u0027Okay. Coat off and left sleeve up, please. Too bad they\u0027re so sensitive up at Gander.\u0027 \u0027Damned sight too bad,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027What are they afraid of? Spreading the black death?\u0027 There came the sharp smell of the alcohol and the jab of the needle. \u0027Thanks,\u0027 said Bond gruffly. He pulled down his sleeve and made to pick his coat up from the back of the chair. His hand went down for it, missed it, went on down, down towards the floor. His body dived after the hand, down, down, down… All the lights were on in the plane. There seemed to be plenty of spare places. Why did he have to get stuck with a passenger whose arm was hogging the central arm-rest. Bond made to get up and change his seat. A wave of nausea swept over him. He closed his eyes and waited. How extraordinary! He was never air-sick. He felt the cold sweat on his face. Handkerchief. Wipe it off. He opened his eyes again and looked down at his arms. The wrists were bound to the arms of his chair. What had happened? He had had his shot and then passed out or something. Had he got violent? What the hell was all this about? He glanced to his right and then stared, aghast. Oddjob was sitting there. Oddjob! Odd job in BO AC uniform! Oddjob glanced incuriously at him and reached for the steward\u0027s bell. Bond heard the pretty ding-dong back in the pantry. There was the rustle of a skirt beside him. He looked up. It was Pussy Galore, trim and fresh in the blue uniform of a stewardess! She said, \u0027Hi, Handsome.\u0027 She gave him the deep, searching look he remembered so well from when? From centuries ago, in another life. Bond said desperately, \u0027For Christ\u0027s sake, what\u0027s going on? Where did you come from?\u0027 The girl smiled cheerfully, \u0027Eating caviar and drinking champagne. You Britishers sure live the life of Reilly when you get up twenty thousand feet. Not a sign of a Brussels sprout and if there\u0027s tea I haven\u0027t got around to it yet. Now, you take it easy. Uncle wants to talk to you.\u0027 She sauntered up the aisle, swinging her hips, and disappeared through the cockpit door. Now nothing could surprise Bond. Goldfinger, in a BOAC captain\u0027s uniform that was rather too large for him, the cap squarely on the centre of his head, closed the cockpit door behind him and came down the aisle. He stood and looked grimly down at Bond. \u0027Well, Mr Bond. So Fate wished us to play the game out. But this time, Mr Bond, there cannot possibly be a card up your sleeve. Ha!\u0027 The sharp bark was a mixture of anger, stoicism and respect. \u0027You certainly turned out to be a snake in my pastures.\u0027 The great head shook slowly. \u0027Why I kept you alive! Why I didn\u0027t crush you like a beetle! You and the girl were useful to me. Yes, I was right about that. But I was mad to have taken the chance. Yes, mad.\u0027 The voice dropped and went slow. \u0027And now tell me, Mr Bond. How did you do it? How did you communicate?\u0027 Bond said equably, \u0027We will have a talk, Goldfinger. And I will tell you certain things. But not until you have taken off these straps and brought me a bottle of bourbon, ice, soda water and a packet of Chesterfields. Then, when you have told me what I wish to know, I will decide what to tell you. As you say, my situation is not favourable, or at least it doesn\u0027t appear to be. So I have nothing to lose and if you want to get something out of me it will be on my own terms.\u0027 Goldfinger looked gravely down. \u0027I have no objection to your conditions. Out of respect for your abilities as an opponent, you shall spend your last journey in comfort. Oddjob\u0027 - the voice was sharp. \u0027Ring the bell for Miss Galore and undo those straps. Get into the seat in front. There is no harm he can do at the rear of the plane but he is not to approach the cockpit door. If need be, kill him at once, but I prefer to get him to our destination alive. Understand?\u0027 \u0027Arrgh.\u0027 Five minutes later Bond had what he wanted. The tray in front of him was down and on it were his whisky and cigarettes. He poured himself a stiff bourbon. Goldfinger was seated in the chair across the aisle, waiting. Bond picked up his drink and sipped it. He was about to take a deeper drink when he saw something. He put the glass carefully down without disturbing the little round paper coaster that had stuck to the bottom of his glass. He lit a cigarette, picked up his drink again and removed the ice-cubes and put them back in the ice bucket. He drank the whisky down ahnost to the end. Now he could read the words through the bottom of the glass. He carefully put the glass down without disturbing the coaster. The message had read, \u0027I\u0027m with you. XXX. P.\u0027 Bond turned and made himself comfortable. He said, \u0027Now then, Goldfinger. First of all, what\u0027s going on, how did you get this plane, where are we heading?\u0027 Goldfinger crossed one leg over the other. He gazed away from Bond, up the aisle. He said in a relaxed, conversational tone, \u0027I took three trucks and drove across country to the vicinity of Cape Hatteras. One of the trucks contained my personal hoard of gold bullion. The other two contained my drivers, spare personnel and those gangsters. I required none of them except Miss Galore. I kept a nucleus of the staff I would need, paid off the others with huge sums and dispersed them gradually along the route. At the coast I held a meeting with the four gang leaders in a deserted place, having left Miss Galore under some pretext with the trucks. I shot the four men in my usual fashion - one bullet for each. I went back to the trucks and explained that the four men had chosen money and independent action. I was now left with six men, the girl and the bullion. I hired a plane and flew to Newark, New Jersey, the crates of gold being passed off as lead for X-ray plates. From there I proceeded alone to a certain address in New York from which I talked with Moscow by radio and explained the mishap to Operation Grand Slam. In the course of the talk I mentioned your name. My friends, whom I believe you know,\u0027 Goldfinger looked hard at Bond, \u0027pass under the generic name of SMERSH. They recognized the name of Bond and told me who you were. I at once understood a great deal of what had previously been hidden from me. SMERSH said they would greatly like to interview you. I pondered the matter. In due course I conceived the plan which you now see in operation. Posing as a friend of yours, I had no difficulty in finding out the flight on which you were booked. Three of my men were formerly of the Luftwaffe. They assured me there would be no difficulty in flying this plane. The rest was mere detail. By cool bluffing, impersonation and the use of a certain amount of force, all the BOAC personnel at Idlewild, the crew of this plane and the passengers were given the necessary injections from which they will now be recovering. We changed clothes with the unconscious crew, the bullion was loaded on the plane, you were dealt with and carried out on a stretcher and in due course the new BOAC crew, with their stewardess, boarded the plane and we took to the air.\u0027 Goldfinger paused. He lifted a hand resignedly. \u0027Of course there were small hitches. We were told to \"follow taxiway Alpha to runway four\", and it was only by following a KLM plane that we were successful. The Idlewild routine was not easy to master and we must have seemed somewhat clumsy and inexperienced, but, Mr Bond, with assurance, strong nerves and a gruff, intimidating manner it is never difficult to override the Civil Service mentality of what, after all, are minor employees. I understand from the wireless operator that a search for this plane is under way. They were already questioning us before we were out of VHP range at Nan-tucket. Then the Distant Early Warning system queried us on high frequency. That did not disturb me. We have enough fuel. We have already had clearance from Moscow for East Berlin, Kiev or Murmansk. We shall take whichever route the weather dictates. There should be no trouble. If there is, I shall talk my way out of it on the radio. No one is going to shoot down a valuable BOAC plane. The mystery and confusion will protect us until we are well within Soviet territory and then, of course, we shall have disappeared without trace.\u0027 To Bond there had been nothing fantastic, nothing impossible about Goldfinger since he had heard the details of Operation Grand Slam. The theft of a Stratocruiser, as Goldfinger had explained it, was preposterous, but no more so than his methods of smuggling gold, his purchase of an atomic warhead. When one examined these things, while they had a touch of magic, of genius even, they were logical exercises. They were bizarre only in their magnitude. Even the tiny manoeuvre of cheating Mr Du Pont had been quite brilliantly contrived. There was no doubt about it, Gold-finger was an artist - a scientist in crime as great in his field as Cellini or Einstein in theirs. \u0027And now, Mr Bond of the British Secret Service, we made a bargain. What have you to tell me? Who put you on to me? What did they suspect? How did you manage to interfere with my plans?\u0027 Goldfinger sat back, placed his hands across his stomach and looked at the ceiling. Bond gave Goldfinger a censored version of the truth. He mentioned nothing about SMERSH or the location of the postbox and he said nothing about the secrets of the Homer, a device that might be new to the Russians. He concluded, \u0027So you see, Goldfinger, you only just got away. But for Tilly Masterton\u0027s intervention at Geneva, you\u0027d have been in the bag by now. You\u0027d be sitting picking your teeth in a Swiss prison waiting to be sent to England. You underestimate the English. They may be slow, but they get there. You think you\u0027ll be pretty safe in Russia? I wouldn\u0027t be too sure. We\u0027ve got people even out of there before now. I\u0027ll give you one last aphorism for your book, Goldfinger: \"Never go a bear of England.\"\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1564/46398.html","bookId":1276,"book":{"id":1276,"title":"007之Goldfinger 金手指","description":"简介： 世界各国突然出现黄金的大量流失,黄金的黑市交易十分兴盛.虽然各国都对金锭做有记号,可是,经过融化重铸后就毫无迹象可寻.政府部门怀疑巨富金手指参与了黑市黄金交易,因为他作为国际商人可以合法拥有并使用大型铸造设备.他在日内瓦拥有一座大银行,各国都有大量黄金储备在...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/24/10-51-50-20-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1564","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
