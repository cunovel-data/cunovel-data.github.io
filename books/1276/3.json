{"id":39515,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER THREE THE MAN WITH AGORAPHOBIA","content":"THE FLAPPING of the curtains wakened Bond. He threw off the single sheet and walked across the thick pile carpet to the picture window that filled the whole of one wall. He drew back the curtains and went out on to the sun-filled balcony. \\n\\n The black and white chequer-board tiles were warm, almost hot to the feet although it could not yet be eight o\u0027clock. A brisk inshore breeze was blowing off the sea, straining the flags of all nations that flew along the pier of the private yacht basin. The breeze was humid and smelt strongly of the sea. Bond guessed it was the breeze that the visitors like, but the residents hate. It would rust the metal fittings in their homes, fox the pages of their books, rot their wallpaper and pictures, breed damp-rot in their clothes. \\n\\n Twelve storeys down the formal gardens, dotted with palm trees and beds of bright croton and traced with neat gravel walks between avenues of bougainvillaea, were rich and dull. Gardeners were working, raking the paths and picking up leaves with the lethargic slow motion of coloured help. Two mowers were at work on the lawns and, where they had already been, sprinklers were gracefully flinging handfuls of spray. \\n\\n Directly below Bond, the elegant curve of the Cabana Club swept down to the beach - two storeys of changing-rooms below a flat roof dotted with chairs and tables and an occasional red and white striped umbrella. Within the curve was the brilliant green oblong of the Olympic-length swimming-pool fringed on all sides by row upon row of mattressed steamer chairs on which the customers would soon be getting their fifty-dollar-a-day sunburn. White-jacketed men were working among them, straightening the lines of chairs, turning the mattresses and sweeping up yesterday\u0027s cigarette butts. Beyond was the long, golden beach and the sea, and more men - raking the tideline, putting up the umbrellas, laying out mattresses. No wonder the neat card inside Bond\u0027s wardrobe had said that the cost of the Aloha Suite was two hundred dollars a day. Bond made a rough calculation. If he was paying the bill, it would take him just three weeks to spend his whole salary for the year. Bond smiled cheerfully to himself. He went back into the bedroom, picked up the telephone and ordered himself a delicious, wasteful breakfast, a carton of king-size Chesterfields and the newspapers. \\n\\n By the time he had shaved and had an ice-cold shower and dressed it was eight o\u0027clock. He walked through into the elegant sitting-room and found a waiter in a uniform of plum and gold laying out his breakfast beside the window. Bond glanced at the Miami Herald. The front page was devoted to yesterday\u0027s failure of an American ICBM at the nearby Cape Canaveral and a bad upset in a big race at Hialeah. \\n\\n Bond dropped the paper on the floor and sat down and slowly ate his breakfast and thought about Mr Du Pont and Mr Goldfinger. \\n\\n His thoughts were inconclusive. Mr Du Pont was either a much worse player than he thought, which seemed unlikely on Bond\u0027s reading of his tough, shrewd character, or else Goldfinger was a cheat. If Goldfinger cheated at cards, although he didn\u0027t need the money, it was certain that he had also made himself rich by cheating or sharp practice on a much bigger scale. Bond was interested in big crooks. He looked forward to his first sight of Goldfinger. He also looked forward to penetrating Goldfinger\u0027s highly successful and, on the face of it, highly mysterious method of fleecing Mr Du Pont. It was going to be a most entertaining day. Idly Bond waited for it to get under way. \\n\\n The plan was that he would meet Mr Du Pont in the garden at ten o\u0027clock. The story would be that Bond had flown down from New York to try and sell Mr Du Pont a block of shares from an English holding in a Canadian Natural Gas property. The matter was clearly confidential and Goldfinger would not think of questioning Bond about details. Shares, Natural Gas, Canada. That was all Bond needed to remember. They would go along together to the roof of the Cabana Club where the game was played and Bond would read his paper and watch. After luncheon, during which Bond and Mr Du Pont would discuss their \u0027business\u0027, there would be the same routine. Mr Du Pont had inquired if there was anything else he could arrange. Bond had asked for the number of Mr Goldfinger\u0027s suite and a passkey. He had explained that if Goldfinger was any kind of a professional card-sharp, or even an expert amateur, he would travel with the usual tools of the trade - marked and shaved cards, the apparatus for the Short Arm Delivery, and so forth. Mr Du Pont had said he would give Bond the key when they met in the garden. He would have no difficulty getting one from the manager. \\n\\n After breakfast, Bond relaxed and gazed into the middle distance of the sea. He was not keyed up by the job on hand, only interested and amused. It was just the kind of job he had needed to clear his palate after Mexico. \\n\\n At half past nine Bond left his suite and wandered along the corridors of his floor, getting lost on his way to the elevator in order to reconnoitre the lay-out of the hotel. Then, having met the same maid twice, he asked his way and went down in the elevator and moved among the scattering of early risers through the Pineapple Shopping Arcade. He glanced into the Bamboo Coffee Shoppe, the Rendezvous Bar, the La Tropicala dining-room, the Kittekat Klub for children and the Boom-Boom Nighterie. He then went purposefully out into the garden. Mr Du Pont, now dressed \u0027for the beach\u0027 by Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch, gave him the pass-key to Goldfinger\u0027s suite. They sauntered over to the Cabana Club and climbed the two short flights of stairs to the top deck. \\n\\n Bond\u0027s first view of Mr Goldfinger was startling. At the far corner of the roof, just below the cliff of the hotel, a man was lying back with his legs up on a steamer chair. He was wearing nothing but a yellow satin bikini slip, dark glasses and a pair of wide tin wings under his chin. The wings, which appeared to fit round his neck, stretched out across his shoulders and beyond them and then curved up slightly to rounded tips. \\n\\n Bond said, \"What the hell\u0027s he wearing round his neck?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You never seen one of those?\u0027 Mr Du Pont was surprised. \u0027That\u0027s a gadget to help your tan. Polished tin. Reflects the sun up under your chin and behind the ears - the bits that wouldn\u0027t normally catch the sun.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Well, well,\u0027 said Bond. \\n\\n When they were a few yards from the reclining figure Mr Du Pont called out cheerfully, in what seemed to Bond an overloud voice, \u0027Hi there!\u0027 \\n\\n Mr Goldfinger did not stir. \\n\\n Mr Du Pont said in his normal voice. \u0027He\u0027s very deaf.\u0027 They were now at Mr Goldfinger\u0027s feet. Mr Du Pont repeated his hail. \\n\\n Mr Goldfinger sat up sharply. He removed his dark glasses. \u0027Why, hullo there.\u0027 He unhitched the wings from round his neck, put them carefully on the ground beside him and got heavily to his feet. He looked at Bond with slow, inquiring eyes. \\n\\n \u0027Like you to meet Mr Bond, James Bond. Friend of mine from New York. Countryman of yours. Come down to try and talk me into a bit of business.\u0027 \\n\\n Mr Goldfinger held out a hand. \u0027Pleased to meet you, Mr Bomb.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond took the hand. It was hard and dry. There was the briefest pressure and it was withdrawn. For an instant Mr Goldfinger\u0027s pale, china-blue eyes opened wide and stared hard at Bond. They stared right through his face to the back of his skull. Then the lids drooped, the shutter closed over the X-ray, and Mr Goldfinger took the exposed plate and slipped it away in his filing system. \\n\\n \u0027So no game today.\u0027 The voice was flat, colourless. The words were more of a statement than a question. \\n\\n \u0027Whaddya mean, no game?\u0027 shouted Mr Du Pont boisterously. \u0027You weren\u0027t thinking I\u0027d let you hang on to my money? Got to get it back or I shan\u0027t be able to leave this darned hotel,\u0027 Mr Du Pont chuckled richly. \u0027I\u0027ll tell Sam to fix the table. James here says he doesn\u0027t know much about cards and he\u0027d like to learn the game. That right, James?\u0027 He turned to Bond. \u0027Sure you\u0027ll be all right with your paper and the sunshine?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027d be glad of the rest,\u0027 said Bond. \u0027Been travelling too much.\u0027 \\n\\n Again the eyes bored into Bond and then drooped. Til get some clothes on. I had intended to have a golf lesson this afternoon from Mr Armour at the Boca Raton. But cards have priority among my hobbies. My tendency to un-cock the wrists too early with the mid-irons will have to wait.\u0027 The eyes rested incuriously on Bond. \u0027You play golf, Mr Bomb?\u0027 \\n\\n Bond raised his voice. \u0027Occasionally, when I\u0027m in England.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027And where do you play?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Huntercombe.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Ah - a pleasant little course. I have recently joined the Royal St Marks. Sandwich is close to one of my business interests. You know it?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I have played there.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027What is your handicap?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Nine.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027That is a coincidence. So is mine. We must have a game one day.\u0027 Mr Goldfinger bent down and picked up his tin wings. He said to Mr Du Pont, \u0027I will be with you in five minutes.\u0027 He walked slowly off towards the stairs. \\n\\n Bond was amused. This social sniffing at him had been done with just the right casual touch of the tycoon who didn\u0027t really care if Bond was alive or dead but, since he was there and alive, might as well place him in an approximate category. \\n\\n Mr Du Pont gave instructions to a steward in a white coat. Two others were already setting up a card table. Bond walked to the rail that surrounded the roof and looked down into the garden, reflecting on Mr Goldfinger. \\n\\n He was impressed. Mr Goldfinger was one of the most relaxed men Bond had ever met. It showed in the economy of his movement, of his speech, of his expressions. Mr Gold-finger wasted no effort, yet there was something coiled, compressed, in the immobility of the man. \\n\\n When Goldfinger had stood up, the first thing that had struck Bond was that everything was out of proportion. Goldfinger was short, not more than five feet tall, and on top of the thick body and blunt, peasant legs, was set almost directly into the shoulders, a huge and it seemed exactly round head. It was as if Goldfinger had been put together with bits of other people\u0027s bodies. Nothing seemed to belong. Perhaps, Bond thought, it was to conceal his ugliness that \\n\\n Goldfinger made such a fetish of sunburn. Without the red-brown camouflage the pale body would be grotesque. The face, under the cliff of crew-cut carroty hair, was as startling, without being as ugly, as the body. It was moon-shaped without being moonlike. The forehead was fine and high and the thin sandy brows were level above the large light blue eyes fringed with pale lashes. The nose was fleshily aquiline between high cheek-bones and cheeks that were more muscular than fat. The mouth was thin and dead straight, but beautifully drawn. The chin and jaws were firm and glinted with health. To sum up, thought Bond, it was the face of a thinker, perhaps a scientist, who was ruthless, sensual, stoical and tough. An odd combination. \\n\\n What else could he guess? Bond always mistrusted short men. They grew up from childhood with an inferiority complex. All their lives they would strive to be big - bigger than the others who had teased them as a child. Napoleon had been short, and Hitler. It was the short men that caused all the trouble in the world. And what about a misshapen short man with red hair and a bizarre face? That might add up to a really formidable misfit. One could certainly feel the repressions. There was a powerhouse of vitality humming in the man that suggested that if one stuck an electric bulb into Goldfinger\u0027s mouth it would light up. Bond smiled at the thought. Into what channels did Goldfinger release his vital force? Into getting rich? Into sex? Into power? Probably into all three. What could his history be? Today he might be an Englishman. What had he been born? Not a Jew - though there might be Jewish blood in him. Not a Latin or anything farther south. Not a Slav. Perhaps a German - no, a Bait! That\u0027s where he would have come from. One of the old Baltic provinces. Probably got away to escape the Russians. Goldfinger would have been warned - or his parents had smelled trouble and they had got him out in time. And what had happened then? How had he worked his way up to being one of the richest men in the world? One day it might be interesting to find out. For the time being it would be enough to find out how he won at cards. \\n\\n \u0027All set?\u0027 Mr Du Pont called to Goldfinger who was coming across the roof towards the card table. With his clothes on - a comfortably fitting dark blue suit, a white shirt open at the neck - Goldfinger cut an almost passable figure. \\n\\n But there was no disguise for the great brown and red football of a head and the flesh-coloured hearing aid plugged into the left ear was net an improvement. \\n\\n Mr Du Pont sat with his back to the hotel. Goldfinger took the seat opposite and cut the cards. Du Pont won the cut, pushed the other pack over to Goldfinger, tapped them to show they were already shuffled and he couldn\u0027t bother to cut, and Goldfinger began the deal. \\n\\n Bond sauntered over and took a chair at Mr Du Font\u0027s elbow. He sat back, relaxed. He made a show of folding his paper to the sports page and watched the deal. \\n\\n Somehow Bond had expected it, but this was no card-sharp. Goldfinger dealt quickly and efficiently, but with no hint of the Mechanic\u0027s Grip, those vital three fingers curled round the long edge of the cards and the index finger at the outside short upper edge - the grip that means you are armed for dealing Bottoms or Seconds. And he wore no signet ring for pricking the cards, no surgical tape round a finger for marking them. \\n\\n Mr Du Pont turned to Bond. \u0027Deal of fifteen cards,\u0027 he commented. \u0027You draw two and discard one. Otherwise straight Regency rules. No monkey business with the red treys counting one, three, five, eight, or any of that European stuff.\u0027 \\n\\n Mr Du Pont picked up his cards. Bond noticed that he sorted them expertly, not grading them according to value from left to right, or holding his wild cards, of which he had two, at the left - a pattern that might help a watchful opponent. Mr Du Pont concentrated his good cards in the centre of his hand with the singletons and broken melds on either side. \\n\\n The game began. Mr Du Pont drew first, a miraculous pair of wild cards. His face betrayed nothing. He discarded casually. He only needed two more good draws to go out unseen. But he would have to be lucky. Drawing two cards doubles the chance of picking up what you want, but it also doubles the chance of picking up useless cards that will only clutter up your hand. \\n\\n Goldfinger played a more deliberate game, almost irritatingly slow. After drawing, he shuffled through his cards again and again before deciding on his discard. \\n\\n On the third draw, Du Pont had improved his hand to the extent that he now needed only one of five cards to go down and out and catch his opponent with a handful of cards which would all count against him. As if Goldfinger knew the danger he was in, he went down for fifty and proceeded to make a canasta with three wild cards and four fives. He also got rid of some more melds and ended with only four cards in his hand. In any other circumstances it would have been ridiculously bad play. As it was, he had made some four hundred points instead of losing over a hundred, for, on the next draw Mr Du Pont filled his hand and, with most of the edge taken off his triumph by Goldfinger\u0027s escape, went down unseen with the necessary two canastas. \\n\\n \u0027By golly, I nearly screwed you that time.\u0027 Mr Du Font\u0027s voice had an edge of exasperation. \u0027What in hell told you to cut an\u0027 run?\u0027 \\n\\n Goldfinger said indifferently, \u0027I smelled trouble.\u0027 He added up his points, announced them and jotted them down, waiting for Mr Du Pont to do the same. Then he cut the cards and sat back and regarded Bond with polite interest. \\n\\n \u0027Will you be staying long, Mr Bomb?\u0027 \\n\\n Bond smiled. \u0027It\u0027s Bond, B-O-N-D. No, I have to go back to New York tonight.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027How sad.\u0027 Goldfinger\u0027s mouth pursed in polite regret. He turned back to the cards and the game went on. Bond picked up his paper and gazed, unseeing, at the baseball scores, while he listened to the quiet routine of the game. Goldfinger won that hand and the next and the next. He won the game. There was a difference of one thousand five hundred points -one thousand five hundred dollars to Goldfinger. \\n\\n \u0027There it goes again!\u0027 It was the plaintive voice of Mr Du Pont. \\n\\n Bond put down his paper. \u0027Does he usually win?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Usually!\u0027 The word was a snort. \u0027He always wins.\u0027 \\n\\n They cut again and Goldfinger began to deal. \\n\\n Bond said, \u0027Don\u0027t you cut for seats? I often find a change of seat helps the luck. Hostage to fortune and so on.\u0027 \\n\\n Goldfinger paused in his deal. He bent his gaze gravely on Bond. \u0027Unfortunately, Mr Bond, that is not possible or I could not play. As I explained to Mr Du Pont at our first game, I suffer from an obscure complaint - agoraphobia -the fear of open spaces. I cannot bear the open,horizon. I must sit and face the hotel.\u0027 The deal continued. \\n\\n \u0027Oh, I\u0027m so sorry.\u0027 Bond\u0027s voice was grave, interested. \u0027That\u0027s a very rare disability. I\u0027ve always been able to understand claustrophobia, but not the other way round. How did it come about?\u0027 \\n\\n Goldfinger picked up his cards and began to arrange his hand. \u0027I have no idea,\u0027 he said equably. \\n\\n Bond got up. \u0027Well, I think I\u0027ll stretch my legs for a bit. See what\u0027s going on in the pool.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027You do just that,\u0027 said Mr Du Pont jovially. \u0027Just take it easy, James. Plenty of time to discuss business over lunch. I\u0027ll see if I can\u0027t dish it out to my friend Goldfinger this time instead of taking it. Be seeing you.\u0027 \\n\\n Goldfinger didn\u0027t look up from his cards. Bond strolled down the roof, past the occasional splayed-out body, to the rail at the far end that overlooked the pool. For a time he stood and contemplated the ranks of pink and brown and white flesh laid out below him on the steamer chairs. The heavy scent of suntan oil came up to him. There were a few children and young people in the pool. A man, obviously a professional diver, perhaps the swimming instructor, stood on the high-dive. He balanced on the balls of his feet, a muscled Greek god with golden hair. He bounced once, casually, and flew off and down, his arms held out like wings. Lazily they arrowed out to cleave the water for the body to pass through. The impact left only a brief turbulence. The diver jack-knifed up again, shaking his head boyishly. There was a smattering of applause. The man trudged slowly down the pool, his head submerged, his shoulders moving with casual power. Bond thought, good luck to you! You won\u0027t be able to keep this up for more than another five or six years. High-divers couldn\u0027t take it for long - the repeated shock to the skull. With ski-jumping, which had the same shattering effect on the frame, high-diving was the shortest-lived sport. Bond radioed to the diver, \u0027Cash in quick! Get into films while the hair\u0027s still gold.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond turned and looked back down the roof towards the two Canasta players beneath the cliff of the hotel. So Gold-finger liked to face the hotel. Or was it that he liked Mr Du Pont to have his back to it? And why? Now, what was the number of Goldfinger\u0027s suite? No 200, the Hawaii Suite. Bond\u0027s on the top floor was 1200. So, all things being equal, Goldfinger\u0027s would be directly below Bond\u0027s, on the second floor, twenty yards or so above the roof of the Cabana Club -twenty yards from the card table. Bond counted down. He closely examined the frontage that should be Goldfinger\u0027s. Nothing. An empty sun balcony. An open door into the dark interior of the suite. Bond measured distances, angles. Yes, that\u0027s how it might be. That\u0027s how it must be! Clever Mr Goldfinger! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1564/46379.html","bookId":1276,"book":{"id":1276,"title":"007之Goldfinger 金手指","description":"简介： 世界各国突然出现黄金的大量流失,黄金的黑市交易十分兴盛.虽然各国都对金锭做有记号,可是,经过融化重铸后就毫无迹象可寻.政府部门怀疑巨富金手指参与了黑市黄金交易,因为他作为国际商人可以合法拥有并使用大型铸造设备.他在日内瓦拥有一座大银行,各国都有大量黄金储备在...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/24/10-51-50-20-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1564","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
