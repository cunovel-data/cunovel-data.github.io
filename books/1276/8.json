{"id":39520,"no":8,"title":"PART TWO: COINCIDENCE CHAPTER EIGHT ALL TO PLAY FOR","content":"\u0027GOOD AFTERNOON, Blacking. All set?\u0027 The voice was casual, authoritative. \u0027I see there\u0027s a car outside. Not somebody looking for a game, I suppose?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m not sure, sir. It\u0027s an old member come back to have a club made up. Would you like me to ask him, sir?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Who is it? What\u0027s his name?\u0027 \\n\\n Bond smiled grimly. He pricked his ears. He wanted to catch every inflection. \\n\\n \u0027A Mr Bond, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n There was a pause. \u0027Bond?\u0027 The voice had not changed. It was politely interested. \u0027Met a fellow called Bond the other day. What\u0027s his first name?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027James, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Oh yes.\u0027 Now the pause was longer. \u0027Does he know I\u0027m here?\u0027 Bond could sense Goldfinger\u0027s antennae probing the situation. \\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s in the workshop, sir. May have seen your car drive up.\u0027 Bond thought: Alfred\u0027s never told a lie in his life. He\u0027s not going to start now. \\n\\n \u0027Might be an idea.\u0027 Now Goldfinger\u0027s voice unbent. He wanted something from Alfred Blacking, some information. \u0027What sort of a game does this chap play? What\u0027s his handicap?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Used to be quite useful when he was a boy, sir. Haven\u0027t seen his game since then.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Hm.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond could feel the man weighing it all up. Bond smelled that the bait was going to be taken. He reached into his bag and pulled out his driver and started rubbing down the grip with a block of shellac. Might as well look busy. A board in the shop creaked. Bond honed away industriously, his back to the open door. \\n\\n \u0027I think we\u0027ve met before.\u0027 The voice from the doorway was low, neutral. \\n\\n Bond looked quickly over his shoulder. \u0027My God, you made me jump. Why\u0027 - recognition dawned - \u0027it\u0027s Gold, Goldman… er - Goldfinger.\u0027 He hoped he wasn\u0027t overplaying it. He said with a hint of dislike, or mistrust, \u0027Where have you sprung from?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I told you I played down here. Remember?\u0027 Goldfinger was looking at him shrewdly. Now the eyes opened wide. The X-ray gaze pierced through to the back of Bond\u0027s skull. \\n\\n \u0027No.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Did not Miss Masterton give you my message?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027No. What was it?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I said I would be over here and that I would like a game of golf with you.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Oh, well,\u0027 Bond\u0027s voice was coldly polite, \u0027we must do that some day.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I was playing with the professional. I will play with you instead.\u0027 Goldfinger was stating a fact. \\n\\n There was no doubt that Goldfinger was hooked. Now Bond must play hard to get. \\n\\n \u0027Why not some other time? I\u0027ve come to order a club. Anyway I\u0027m not in practice. There probably isn\u0027t a caddie.\u0027 Bond was being as rude as he could. Obviously the last thing he wanted to do was play with Goldfinger. \\n\\n \u0027I also haven\u0027t played for some time.\u0027 (Bloody liar, thought Bond.) \u0027Ordering a club will not take a moment.\u0027 Goldfinger turned back into the shop. \u0027Blacking, have you got a caddie for Mr Bond?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Then that is arranged.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond wearily thrust his driver back into his bag. \u0027Well, all right then.\u0027 He thought of a final way of putting Goldfinger off. He said roughly, \u0027But I warn you I like playing for money. I can\u0027t be bothered to knock a ball round just for the fun of it.\u0027 Bond felt pleased with the character he was building up for himself. \\n\\n Was there a glint of triumph, quickly concealed, in Gold-finger\u0027s pale eyes? He said indifferently, \u0027That suits me. Anything you like. Off handicap, of course. I think you said you\u0027re nine.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Yes.\u0027 \\n\\n Goldfinger said carefully, \u0027Where, may I ask?5 \\n\\n \u0027Huntercombe.\u0027 Bond was also nine at Sunningdale. Huntercombe was an easier course. Nine at Huntercombe wouldn\u0027t frighten Goldfinger. \\n\\n \u0027And I also am nine. Here. Up on the board. So it\u0027s a level game. Right?\u0027 \\n\\n Bond shrugged. \u0027You\u0027ll be too good for me.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027I doubt it. However,\u0027 Goldfinger was offhand,\u0027tell you what I\u0027ll do. That bit of money you removed from me in Miami. Remember? The big figure was ten. I like a gamble. It will be good for me to have to try. I will play you double or quits for that.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond said indifferently, \u0027That\u0027s too much.\u0027 Then, as if he thought better of it, thought he might win, he said - with just the right amount of craft mixed with reluctance - \u0027Of course you can say that was \"found money\". I won\u0027t miss it if it goes again. Oh, well, all right. Easy come easy go. Level match. Ten thousand dollars it is.\u0027 \\n\\n Goldfinger turned away. He said, and there was a sudden sweetness in the flat voice, \u0027That\u0027s all arranged then, Mr Blacking. Many thanks. Put your fee down on my account. Very sorry we shall be missing our game. Now, let me pay the caddie fees.\u0027 \\n\\n Alfred Blacking came into the workroom and picked up Bond\u0027s clubs. He looked very directly at Bond. He said, \u0027Remember what I told you, sir.\u0027 One eye closed and opened again. \u0027I mean about that flat swing of yours. It needs watching - all the time.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond smiled at him. Alfred had long ears. He might not have caught the figure, but he knew that somehow this was to be a key game. \u0027Thanks, Alfred. I won\u0027t forget. Four Pen-folds - with hearts on them. And a dozen tees. I won\u0027t be a minute.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond walked through the shop and out to his car. The bowler-hatted man was polishing the metal work of the Rolls with a cloth. Bond felt rather than saw him stop and watch Bond take out his zip bag and go into the club house. The man had a square flat yellow face. One of the Koreans? \\n\\n Bond paid his green-fee to Hampton, the steward, and went into the changing-room. It was just the same - the same tacky smell of old shoes and socks and last summer\u0027s sweat. Why was it a tradition of the most famous golf clubs that their standard of hygiene should be that of a Victorian private school? Bond changed his socks and put on the battered old pair of nailed Saxones. He took off the coat of his yellowing black and white hound\u0027s tooth suit and pulled on a faded black wind-cheater. Cigarettes? Lighter? He was ready to go \\n\\n Bond walked slowly out, preparing his mind for the game. On purpose he had needled this man into a high, tough match so that Goldfinger\u0027s respect for him should be increased and Goldfinger\u0027s view of Bond - that he was the type of ruthless, hard .adventurer who might be very useful to Goldfinger - would be confirmed. Bond had thought that perhaps a hundred-pound Nassau would be the form. But ten thousand dollars! There had probably never been such a high singles game in history-except in the finals of American Championships or in the big amateur Calcutta Sweeps where it was the backers rather than the players who had the money on. Goldfinger\u0027s private accounting must have taken a nasty dent. He wouldn\u0027t have liked that. He would be aching to get some of his money back. When Bond had talked about playing high, Goldfinger had seen his chance. So be it. But one thing was certain, for a hundred reasons Bond could not afford to lose. \\n\\n He turned into the shop and picked up the balls and tees from Alfred Blacking. \\n\\n \u0027Hawker\u0027s got the clubs, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond strolled out across the five hundred yards of shaven seaside turf that led to the first tee. Goldfinger was practising on the putting green. His caddie stood near by, rolling balk to him. Goldfinger putted in the new fashion - between his legs with a mallet putter. Bond felt encouraged. He didn\u0027t believe in the system. He knew it was no good practising himself. His old hickory Calamity Jane had its good days and its bad. There was nothing to do about it. He knew also that the St Marks practice green bore no resemblance, in speed or texture, to the greens on the course. \\n\\n Bond caught up with the limping, insouciant figure of his caddie who was sauntering along chipping at an imaginary ball with Bond\u0027s blaster. \u0027Afternoon, Hawker.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Afternoon, sir.\u0027 Hawker handed Bond the blaster and threw down three used balls. His keen sardonic poacher\u0027s face split in a wry grin of welcome. \u0027HowVe you been keep in\u0027, sir? Played any golf in the last twenty years? Can you still put them on the roof of the starter\u0027s hut?\u0027 This referred to the day when Bond, trying to do just that before a match, had put two balls through the starter\u0027s window. \\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s see.\u0027 Bond took the blaster and hefted it in his hand, gauging the distance. The tap of the balls on the practice green had ceased. Bond addressed the ball, swung quickly, lifted his head and shanked the ball almost at right angles. He tried again. This time it was a dunch. A foot of turf flew up. The ball went ten yards. Bond turned to Hawker, who was looking his most sardonic. \u0027It\u0027s all right, Hawker. Those were for show. Now then, one for you.\u0027 He stepped up to the third ball, took his club back slowly and whipped the club head through. The ball soared a hundred feet, paused elegantly, dropped eighty feet on to the thatched roof of the starter\u0027s hut and bounced down. \\n\\n Bond handed back the club. Hawker\u0027s eyes were thoughtful, amused. He said nothing. He pulled out the driver and handed it to Bond. They walked together to the first tee, talking about Hawker\u0027s family. \\n\\n Goldfinger joined them, relaxed, impassive. Bond greeted Goldfinger\u0027s caddie, an obsequious, talkative man called Foulks whom Bond had never liked. Bond glanced at Gold-finger\u0027s clubs. They were a brand new set of American Ben Hogans with smart St Marks leather covers for the woods. The bag was one of the stitched black leather holdalls favoured by American pros. The clubs were in individual cardboard tubes for easy extraction. It was a pretentious outfit, but the best. \\n\\n \u0027Toss for honour?\u0027 Goldfinger flicked a coin. \\n\\n \u0027Tails.\u0027 \\n\\n It was heads. Goldfinger took out his driver and unpeeled a new ball. He said, \u0027Dunlop 65. Number One. Always use the same ball. What\u0027s yours?\u0027 \\n\\n Tenfold. Hearts.\u0027 \\n\\n Goldfinger looked keenly at Bond. \u0027Strict Rules of Golf?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Naturally.\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Right.\u0027 Goldfinger walked on to the tee and teed up. He took one or two careful, concentrated practice swings. It was a type of swing Bond knew well - the grooved, mechanical, repeating swing of someone who\u0027had studied the game with great care, read all the books and spent five thousand pounds on the finest pro teachers. It would be a good, scoring swing which might not collapse under pressure. Bond envied it. \\n\\n Goldfinger took up his stance, wagged gracefully, took his club head back in a wide slow arc and, with his eyes glued to the ball, broke his wrists correctly. He brought the club head mechanically, effortlessly, down and through the ball and into a rather artificial, copybook finish. The ball went straight and true about two hundred yards down the fairway. \\n\\n It was an excellent, uninspiring shot. Bond knew that Goldfinger would be capable of repeating the same swing with different clubs again and again round the eighteen holes. \\n\\n Bond took his place, gave himself a lowish tee, addressed the ball with careful enmity and, with a flat, racket-player\u0027s swing in which there was just too much wrist for safety, lashed the ball away. It was a fine, attacking drive that landed past Goldfinger\u0027s ball and rolled on fifty yards. But it had had a shade of draw and ended on the edge of the left-hand rough. \\n\\n They were two good drives. As Bond handed his club to Hawker and strolled off in the wake of the more impatient Goldfinger, he smelled the sweet smell of the beginning of a knock-down-and-drag-out game of golf on a beautiful day in May with the larks singing-over the greatest seaside course in the world. \\n\\n The first hole of the Royal St Marks is four hundred and fifty yards long - four hundred and fifty yards of undulating fairway with one central bunker to trap a mis-hit second shot and a chain of bunkers guarding three-quarters of the green to trap a well-hit one. You can slip through the unguarded quarter, but the fairway slopes to the right there and you are more likely to end up with a nasty first-chip-of-the-day out of the rough. Goldfinger was well placed to try for this opening. Bond watched him take what was probably a spoon, make his two practice swings and address the ball. \\n\\n Many unlikely people play golf, including people who are blind, who have only one arm, or even no legs, and people often wear bizarre clothes to the game. Other golfers don\u0027t think them odd, for there are no rules of appearance or dress at golf. That is one of its minor pleasures. But Goldfinger had made an attempt to look smart at golf and that is the only way of dressing that is incongruous on a links. Everything matched in a blaze of rust-coloured tweed from the buttoned \u0027golfer\u0027s cap\u0027 centred on the huge, flaming red hair, to the brilliantly polished, almost orange shoes. The plus-four suit was too well cut and the plus-fours themselves had been pressed down the sides. The stockings were of a matching heather mixture and had green garter tabs. It was as if Goldfinger had gone to his tailor and said, \u0027Dress me for golf - you know, like they wear in Scotland.\u0027 Social errors made no impression on Bond, and for the matter of that he rarely noticed them. With Goldfinger it was different. Everything about the man had grated on Bond\u0027s teeth from the first moment he had seen him. The assertive blatancy of his clothes was just part of the malevolent animal magnetism that had affected Bond from the beginning. \\n\\n Goldfinger executed his mechanical, faultless swing. The ball flew true but just failed to make the slope and curled off to the right to finish pinhigh off the green in the short rough. Easy five. A good chip could turn it into a four, but it would have to be a good one. \\n\\n Bond walked over to his ball. It was lying cocked up, just off the fairway. Bond took his number four wood. Now for the \u0027all air route\u0027 - a soaring shot that would carry the cross-bunkers and give him two putts for a four. Bond remembered the dictum of the pros: \u0027It^s never too early to start winning.\u0027 He took it easy, determined not to press for the long but comfortable carry. \\n\\n As soon as Bond had hit the shot he knew it wouldn\u0027t do. The difference between a good golf shot and a bad one is the same as the difference between a beautiful and a plain woman - a matter of millimetres. In this case, the club face had gone through just that one millimetre too low under the ball. The arc of flight was high and soft - no legs. Why the hell hadn\u0027t he taken a spoon or a two iron off that lie? The ball hit the lip of the far bunker and fell back. Now it was the blaster, and fighting for a half. \\n\\n Bond never worried too long about his bad or stupid shots. He put them behind him and thought of the next. He came up with the bunker, took his blaster and measured the distance to the pin. Twenty yards. The ball was lying well back. Should he splash it out with a wide stance and an outside-in swing, or should he blast it and take plenty of sand? For safety\u0027s sake he would blast it out. Bond went down into the bunker. Head down and follow well through. The easiest shot in golf. Try and put it dead. The wish, half way down his bade swing, hurried the hands in front of the club head. The loft was killed and there was the ball rolling back off the face. Get it out, you bloody fool, and hole a long putt! Now Bond took too much sand. He was out, but barely on the green. Goldfinger bent to his chip and kept his head down until the ball was half way to the hole. The ball stopped three inches from the pin. Without waiting to be given the putt, Goldfinger turned his back on Bond and walked off towards the second tee. Bond picked up his ball and took his driver from Hawker. \\n\\n \u0027What does he say his handicap is, sir?\u0027 \\n\\n \u0027Nine. It\u0027s a level match. Have to do better than that though. Ought to have taken my spoon for the second.\u0027 \\n\\n Hawker said encouragingly, \u0027It\u0027s early days yet, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n Bond knew it wasn\u0027t. It was always too early to start losing. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1564/46384.html","bookId":1276,"book":{"id":1276,"title":"007之Goldfinger 金手指","description":"简介： 世界各国突然出现黄金的大量流失,黄金的黑市交易十分兴盛.虽然各国都对金锭做有记号,可是,经过融化重铸后就毫无迹象可寻.政府部门怀疑巨富金手指参与了黑市黄金交易,因为他作为国际商人可以合法拥有并使用大型铸造设备.他在日内瓦拥有一座大银行,各国都有大量黄金储备在...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/24/10-51-50-20-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1564","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
