Bond turned. \u0027Hullo.\u0027 His face registered polite surprise. \u0027Didn\u0027t hear you arrive. How did it go?\u0027 Goldfinger\u0027s expression was equally bland. They might have been old friends, neighbours in the country who were accustomed to drop in on each other for a drink. \u0027Oh, it sorted itself out. My chap had had a row in a pub with some American Air Force men who had called him a bloody Jap. I explained to the police that Koreans don\u0027t like being called Japs. They let him off with a caution. Terribly sorry to have been so long. Hope you weren\u0027t bored. Do have another drink.\u0027 \u0027Thanks. But it\u0027s hardly seemed five minutes since you left. Been reading what Darwin has to say about the fourteen club rule. Interesting point of view..\u0027 Bond launched into a detailed review of the article, adding his own comments on the rule. Goldfinger stood patiently until it was over. He said, \u0027Yes, it\u0027s a complicated business. Of course you play rather a different game from me, more workmanlike. With my kind of swing, I find I need all the clubs I\u0027m allowed. Well, I\u0027ll just go up and wash and then we\u0027ll have dinner. Shan\u0027t be a moment.\u0027 Bond busied himself noisily with pouring another drink, sat down and picked up Country Life. He watched Gold finger climb the stairs and disappear down the corridor. He could visualize every step. He found he was reading the periodical upside down. He turned it round and stared blindly at a fine photograph of Blenheim Palace. There was dead silence upstairs. Then a distant lavatory chain was pulled and a door clicked shut. Bond reached for his drink, took a deep swallow and put the glass down beside his chair. Goldfinger was coming down the stairs. Bond turned the pages of Country Life and flicked ash off his cigarette into the grate. Now Goldfinger was crossing the floor towards him. Bond lowered his paper and looked up. Goldfinger was carrying the ginger cat tucked carelessly under one arm. He reached the fireplace, bent forward and pressed the bell. He turned towards Bond. \u0027Do you like cats?\u0027 His gaze was flat, incurious. \u0027Sufficiently.\u0027 The service door opened. The chauffeur stood in the frame. He still wore his bowler hat and his shiny black gloves. He gazed impassively at Goldfinger. Goldfinger crooked a finger. The chauffeur approached and stood within the circle by the fire. Goldfinger turned to Bond. He said conversationally, \u0027This is my handy man.\u0027 He smiled thinly. \u0027That is something of a joke. Oddjob, show Mr Bond your hands.\u0027 He smiled again at Bond. \u0027I call him Oddjob because that describes his functions on my staff.\u0027 The Korean slowly pulled off his gloves and came and stood at arm\u0027s length from Bond and held out his hands palm upwards. Bond got up and looked at them. They were big and fat with muscle. The fingers all seemed to be the same length. They were very blunt at the tips and the tips glinted as if they were made of yellow bone. \u0027Turn them over and show Mr Bond the sides.\u0027 There were no fingernails. Instead there was this same, yellowish carapace. The man turned the hands sideways. Down each edge of the hands was a hard ridge of the same bony substance. Bond raised his eyebrows at Goldfinger. Goldfinger said, \u0027We will have a demonstration.\u0027 He pointed at the thick oak banisters that ran up the stairs. The rail was a massive six inches by four thick. The Korean obediently walked over to the stairs and climbed a few steps. He stood with his hands at his sides, gazing across at Gold-finger like a good retriever. Goldfinger gave a quick nod. Impassively the Korean lifted his right hand high and straight above his head and brought the side of it down like an axe across the heavy polished rail. There was a splintering crash and the rail sagged, broken through the centre. Again the hand went up and flashed down. This time it swept right through the rail leaving a jagged gap. Splinters clattered down on to the floor of the hall. The Korean straightened himself and stood to attention, waiting for further orders. There was no flush of effort in his face and no hint of pride in his achievement. Goldfinger beckoned. The man came back across the floor. Goldfinger said, \u0027His feet are the same, the outside edges of them. Oddjob, the mantelpiece.\u0027 Goldfinger pointed at the heavy shelf of carved wood above the fireplace. It was about seven feet off the ground-six inches higher than the top of the Korean\u0027s bowler hat. \u0027Garch a har?\u0027 \u0027Yes, take off your coat and hat.\u0027 Goldfinger turned to Bond. \u0027Poor chap\u0027s got a cleft palate. I shouldn\u0027t think there are many people who understand him beside me.\u0027 Bond reflected how useful that would be, a slave who could only communicate with the world through his interpreter - better even than the deaf mutes of the harems, more tightly bound to his master, more secure. Oddjob had taken off his coat and hat and placed them neatly on the floor. Now he rolled his trouser legs up to the knee and stood back in the wide well-planted stance of the judo expert. He looked as if a charging elephant wouldn\u0027t put him off balance. \u0027Better stand back, Mr Bond.\u0027 The teeth glittered in the wide mouth. \u0027This blow snaps a man\u0027s neck like a daffodil.\" Goldfinger drew aside the low settee with the drink tray. Now the Korean had a clear run. But he was only three long steps away. How could he possibly reach the high mantelpiece? Bond watched, fascinated. Now the slanting eyes in the flat yellow mask were glinting with a fierce intentness. Faced by such a man, thought Bond, one could only go down on one\u0027s knees and wait for death. Goldfinger lifted his hand. The bunched toes in the polished soft leather shoes seemed to grip the ground. The Korean took one long crouching stride with knees well bent and then whirled off the ground. In mid-air his feet slapped together like a ballet dancer\u0027s, but higher than a ballet dancer\u0027s have ever reached, and then the body bent sideways and downwards and the right foot shot out like a piston. There came a crashing thud. Gracefully the body settled back down on the hands, now splayed on the floor, the elbows bent to take the weight and then straightened sharply to throw the man up and back on his feet. Oddjob stood to attention. This time there was a gleam of triumph in his flat eyes as he looked at the three-inch jagged bite the edge of his foot had taken out of the mantelpiece. Bond looked at the man in deep awe. And only two nights ago, he, Bond, had been working on his manual of unarmed combat! There was nothing, absolutely nothing, in all his reading, all his experience, to approach what he had just witnessed. This was not a man of flesh and blood. This was a living club, perhaps the most dangerous animal on the face of the earth. Bond had to do it, had to give homage to this uniquely dreadful person. He held out his hand. \u0027Softly, Oddjob.\u0027 Goldfinger\u0027s voice was the crack of a whip. The Korean bowed his head and took Bond\u0027s hand in his. He kept his fingers straight and merely bent his thumb in a light clasp. It was like holding a piece of board. He released Bond\u0027s hand and went to his neat pile of clothes. \u0027Forgive me, Mr Bond, and I appreciate your gesture.\u0027 Goldfinger\u0027s face showed his approval. \u0027But Oddjob doesn\u0027t know his own strength - particularly when he is keyed up. And those hands are like machine-tools. He could have crushed your hand to pulp without meaning to. Now then,\u0027 Oddjob had dressed and was standing respectfully at attention, \u0027you did well, Oddjob. I\u0027m glad to see you are in training. Here\u0027 - Goldfinger took the cat from under his arm and tossed it to the Korean who caught it eagerly-\u0027I am tired of seeing this animal around. You may have it for dinner.\u0027 The Korean\u0027s eyes gleamed. \u0027And tell them in the kitchen that we will have our own dinner at once.\u0027 The Korean inclined his head sharply and turned away. Bond hid his disgust. He realized that all this exhibition was simply a message to him, a warning, a light rap on the knuckles. It said, \u0027You see my power, Mr Bond. I could easily have killed you or maimed you. Oddjob was giving an exhibition and you got in the way. I would certainly be innocent, and Oddjob would get off with a light sentence. Instead, the cat will be punished in your place. Bad luck on the cat, of course.\u0027 Bond said casually, \u0027Why does the man always wear that bowler hat?\u0027 \u0027Oddjob!\u0027 The Korean had reached the service door. \u0027The hat.\u0027 Goldfinger pointed at a panel in the woodwork near the fireplace. Still holding the cat under his left arm, Oddjob turned and walked stolidly back towards them. When he was half way across the floor, and without pausing or taking aim, he reached up to his hat, took it by the rim and flung it sideways with all his force. There was a loud clang. For an instant the rim of the bowler hat stuck an inch deep in the panel Gold-finger had indicated, then it fell and clattered on the floor. Goldfinger smiled politely at Bond. \u0027A light but very strong alloy, Mr Bond. I fear that will have damaged the felt covering, but Oddjob will put on another. He\u0027s surprisingly quick with a needle and thread. As you can imagine, that blow would have smashed a man\u0027s skull or half severed his neck. A homely and a most ingeniously concealed weapon, I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll agree.\u0027 \u0027Yes, indeed.\u0027 Bond smiled with equal politeness. \u0027Useful chap to have around.\" Oddjob had picked up his hat and disappeared. There came the boom of a gong. \u0027Ah, dinner! Shall we go in?\u0027 Goldfinger led the way to a door concealed in the panelling to the right of the fireplace. He pressed a hidden latch and they walked through. The small dining-room matched the heavy wealth of the hall. It was brilliantly lit from a central chandelier and by candles on a round table that glittered with silver and glass. They sat down opposite each other. Two yellow-faced servants in white mess-jackets brought dishes from a loaded serving-table. The first course was some curried mess with rice. Goldfinger noticed Bond\u0027s hesitation. He gave a dry chuckle. \u0027It\u0027s all right, Mr Bond. Shrimp, not the cat.\u0027 \u0027Ah.\u0027 Bond\u0027s expression was non-committal. \u0027Please try the Moselle. I hope it will be to your taste. It is a Piesporter Goldtropfchen \u002753. Help yourself. These people are as likely to pour it into your plate as your glass.\u0027 There was a slim bottle in an ice bucket in front of Bond. He poured some of the wine and tasted it. It was nectar and ice cold. Bond congratulated his host. Goldfinger gave a curt nod. \u0027I don\u0027t myself drink or smoke, Mr Bond. Smoking, I find the most ridiculous of all the varieties of human behaviour and practically the only one that is entirely against nature. Can you imagine a cow or any animal taking a mouthful of smouldering straw then breathing in the smoke and blowing it out through its nostrils? Pah!\u0027 Goldfinger showed a rare trace of emotion. \u0027It is a/vile practice. As for drinking, I am something of a chemist and I have yet to find a liquor that is free from traces of a number of poisons, some of them deadly, such as fusel oil, acetic acid, ethylacetate, acetal-dehyde and furfurol. A quantity of some of these poisons taken neat would kill you. In the small amounts you find in a bottle of liquor they produce various ill effects most of which are lightly written off as \"a hangover\".\u0027 Goldfinger paused with a forkful of curried shrimp half way to his mouth. \u0027Since you are a drinker, Mr Bond, I will give you one word of good advice. Never drink so-called Napoleon brandy, particularly when it is described as \"aged in the wood\". That particular potion contains more of the poisons I have mentioned than any other liquor I have analysed. Old bourbon comes next.\u0027 Goldfinger closed his animadversions with a mouthful of shrimp. \u0027Thank you. I\u0027ll remember. Perhaps for those reasons I have recently taken to vodka. They tell me its filtration through activated charcoal is a help.\u0027 Bond, dredging this piece of expertise out of dim recollections of something he had read, was rather proud of having been able to return Goldfinger\u0027s powerful serve. Goldfinger glanced at him sharply. \u0027You seem to understand something of these matters. Have you studied chemistry?\u0027 \u0027Only dabbled in it.\u0027 It was time to move on. \u0027I was very impressed by that chauffeur of yours. Where did he learn that fantastic combat stuff? Where did it come from? Is that what the Koreans use?\u0027 Goldfinger patted his mouth with his napkin. He snapped his fingers. The two men cleared away the plates and brought roast duckling and a bottle of Mouton Rothschild 1947 for Bond. When they had withdrawn into immobility at each end of the serving-table, Goldfinger said, \u0027Have you ever heard of Karate? No? Well that man is one of the three in the world who have achieved the Black Belt in Karate. Karate is a branch of judo, but it is to judo what a Spandau is to a catapult.\u0027 \u0027I could see that.\u0027 \u0027The demonstration was an elementary one. Mr Bond\u0027 -Goldfinger held up the drumstick he had been gnawing - \u0027I can tell you that if Oddjob had used the appropriate single blow on any one of seven spots on your body, you would,now be dead.\u0027 Goldfinger bit at the side of the drumstick with relish. Bond said seriously, \u0027That\u0027s interesting. I only know five ways of killing Oddjob with one blow.\u0027 Goldfinger seemed not to hear the comment. He put down his drumstick and took a deep draught of water. He sat back and spoke while Bond went on eating the excellent food. \u0027Karate, Mr Bond, is based on the theory that the human body possesses five striking surfaces and thirty-seven vulnerable spots - vulnerable, that is, to an expert in Karate whose finger-tips, the side of the hands and the feet are hardened into layers of corn, which is far stronger and more flexible than bone. Every day of his life, Mr Bond, Oddjob spends one hour hitting either sacks of unpolished rice or a strong post whose top is wound many times round with thick rope. He then spends another hour at physical training which is more that of a ballet school than of a gymnasium.\u0027 \u0027When does he practise tossing the bowler hat?\u0027 Bond had no intention of succumbing to this psychological warfare. Goldfinger frowned at the interruption. \u0027I have never inquired,\u0027 he said without humour. \u0027But I think you can take it that Oddjob keep his eye in at all his skills. However, you were asking where Karate originated. It originated in China where wandering Buddhist priests became an easy prey for footpads and bandits. Their religion did not allow them to carry weapons, so they developed their own form of unarmed combat. The inhabitants of Okinawa refined the art to its present form when the Japanese forbade them to carry weapons. They developed the five striking surfaces of the human body - the fist, the edge of the hand, the fingertips, the ball of the foot and the elbows - and toughened them until they were enveloped in layers of corn. There is no follow-through in a Karate blow. The entire body is stiffened at the moment of impact, with the emphasis on the hips, and then instantly relaxed so that balance is never lost. It is astonishing what Oddjob can do. I have seen him hit a brick wall with his entire force and not hurt his hand. He can split three half-inch thick boards, piled one upon the other, with one blow of the hand. You have seen what he can do with his foot.\u0027 Bond took a deep draught of the delicious claret. \u0027All this must be rather hard on your furniture.\u0027 Goldfinger shrugged. \u0027I have no more use for this house. I thought a demonstration would amuse you. I hope you agree that Oddjob earned his cat.\u0027 The X-ray eyes blazed briefly across the table. \u0027Does he train on cats?\u0027 \u0027He regards them as a great delicacy. He acquired the taste during a famine in his country when he was young.\u0027 Bond thought it was time to delve rather more deeply. \u0027Why do you need such a man? He can\u0027t be very good company.\u0027 \u0027Mr Bond\u0027 - Goldfinger snapped his fingers for the two servants - \u0027it happens that I am a rich man, a very rich man, and the richer the man the more he needs protection. The ordinary bodyguard or detective is usually a retired policeman. Such men are valueless. Their reactions are slow, their methods old-fashioned, and they are open to bribery. Moreover, they have a respect for human life. That is no good if I wish to stay alive. The Koreans have no such feelings. That is why the Japanese employed them as guards for their prison camps during the war. They are the cruellest, most ruthless people in the world. My own staff are hand picked for these qualities. They have served me well. I have no complaints. Nor have they. They are well paid and well fed and housed. When they want women, street women are brought down from London, well remunerated for their services and sent back. The women are not much to look at, but they are white and that is all the Koreans ask - to submit the white race to the grossest indignities. There are sometimes accidents but\u0027 - the pale eyes gazed blankly down the table - \u0027money is an effective winding-sheet.\u0027 Bond smiled. \u0027You like the aphorism? It is my own.\u0027 An excellent cheese souffle came and was followed by coffee. They ate in silence, both apparently comfortable and relaxed by these confidences. Bond certainly was. Goldfinger, obviously by design, was letting his hair down - not far, not farther than his shoulders, but he was showing Bond one of his private faces, presumably the one to which he thought Bond would respond - the ruthlessly efficient, cold-blooded tycoon. Perhaps, after all, Bond\u0027s spying in the house, which Goldfinger must at least presume, had revealed something about Bond that Goldfinger was pleased to know - that Bond had a crooked side to him, that he wasn\u0027t \u0027a gentleman\u0027 in more than appearance. Now there should be more probing and then, with luck, the proposition would follow. Bond sat back and lit a cigarette. He said, \u0027That\u0027s a beautiful car you\u0027ve got. Must be about the last of the series. About 1925, wasn\u0027t it - two blocks of three cylinders with two plugs for each cylinder, one set fired from the mag. and the other from the coil?\u0027 \u0027You are correct. But in other respects. I have had to introduce some modifications. I have added five leaves to the springs and fitted disc brakes to the rear wheels to increase the braking power. The Servo-operated front-wheel brakes were not sufficient.\u0027 \u0027Oh. Why not? The top speed wouldn\u0027t be more than fifty. The body can\u0027t be all that heavy.\u0027 Goldfinger raised his eyebrows. \u0027You think not? One ton of armour plating and armour-plated glass make a big difference.\u0027 Bond smiled. \u0027Ah! I see. You certainly do take good care of yourself. But how does that work flying the Channel? Doesn\u0027t the car go through the floor of the plane?\u0027 T take a plane to myself. The Silver City company knows the car. It is a regular routine, twice a year.\u0027 \u0027Just touring round Europe?\u0027 \u0027A golfing holiday.\u0027 \u0027Great fun. Always wanted to do it myself.\u0027 Goldfinger didn\u0027t take the bait. \u0027You can afford to now.\u0027 Bond smiled. \u0027Oh, that extra ten thousand dollars. But I may need that if I decide to move to Canada.\u0027 \u0027You think you could make money there? Do you want to make a lot of money?\u0027 Bond\u0027s voice was eager. \u0027Very much. There\u0027s no other point in working.\u0027 \u0027Unfortunately most ways of making big money take a long time. By the time one has made the money one is too old to enjoy it.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s the trouble. I\u0027m always on the lookout for shortcuts. You won\u0027t find them here. Taxation\u0027s too heavy.\u0027 \u0027Quite. And the laws are strict.\u0027 \u0027Yes. I found that out.\u0027 \u0027Indeed?\u0027 \u0027Got on the fringe of the heroin racket. Only just got out without burning my fingers. Of course this\u0027ll go no further?\u0027 Goldfinger shrugged his shoulders. \u0027Mr Bond, someone said that \"law is the crystallized prejudices of the community\". I agree with that definition. It happens to apply most strongly to the traffic in drugs. Even if it didn\u0027t, I am not concerned with assisting the police.\u0027 \u0027Well, it was like this…\u0027 Bond launched into the story of the Mexican traffic, swapping roles with Blackwell. He ended up, \u0027I was lucky to get away with it, but it didn\u0027t make me particularly popular with Universal Export.\u0027 \u0027I daresay not. An interesting story. You seem to have shown resource. You are not tempted to continue in the same line of business?\u0027 Bond shrugged his shoulders. \u0027A bit too tricky. To judge by this Mexican, the big men in the business aren\u0027t quite big enough when it comes to the pinch. When things got tough he didn\u0027t fight back - except with his mouth.\u0027 \u0027Well, Mr Bond,\u0027 Goldfinger got up from the table and Bond followed suit. \u0027It\u0027s been an interesting evening. I don\u0027t know that I would go back into heroin. There are safer ways of making big money. You want to be certain that the odds are right and then you should hazard everything. Doubling one\u0027s money isn\u0027t easy and the chances don\u0027t occur frequently. You would like to hear another of my aphorisms?\u0027 \u0027Yes.\u0027 \u0027Well, Mr Bond,\u0027 Goldfinger gave the rich man\u0027s thin smile. \u0027The safest way to double your money is fold it twice and put it in your pocket.\u0027 Bond, the bank clerk barkening to the bank manager, smiled dutifully but made no comment. This just wasn\u0027t good enough. He was getting nowhere. But instinct told him not to put his foot down on the accelerator. They went back into the hall. Bond held out his hand. \u0027Well, many thanks for the excellent dinner. Time I went and got some sleep. Perhaps we shall run into each other again some day.\u0027 Goldfinger pressed Bond\u0027s hand briefly and pushed it away from him. It was another mannerism of the millionaire subconsciously afraid of\u0027the touch\u0027. He looked hard at Bond. He said enigmatically, \u0027I shouldn\u0027t be at all surprised, Mr Bond.\u0027 On his way across the Isle of Thanet in the moonlight, Bond turned the phrase over and over in his mind. He undressed and got into bed thinking of it, unable to guess its significance. It could mean that Goldfinger intended to get in touch with Bond, or it could mean that Bond must try and keep in touch with Goldfinger. Heads the former, tails the latter. Bond got out of bed and took a coin from the dressing-table and tossed it. It came down tails. So it was up to him to keep close to Goldfinger! So be it. But his cover would have to be pretty darn good the next time they \u0027ran into\u0027 each other. Bond got back into bed and was instantly asleep.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1564/46387.html","bookId":1276,"book":{"id":1276,"title":"007之Goldfinger 金手指","description":"简介： 世界各国突然出现黄金的大量流失,黄金的黑市交易十分兴盛.虽然各国都对金锭做有记号,可是,经过融化重铸后就毫无迹象可寻.政府部门怀疑巨富金手指参与了黑市黄金交易,因为他作为国际商人可以合法拥有并使用大型铸造设备.他在日内瓦拥有一座大银行,各国都有大量黄金储备在...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/24/10-51-50-20-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1564","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
