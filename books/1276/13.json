{"id":39525,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER THIRTEEN \u0027IF YOU TOUCH ME THERE…\u0027","content":"BOND FELT pleased with himself. A whole lot of people were going to get very angry with Goldfinger. You can do a lot of dirty work with twenty thousand pounds. Now plans would have to be altered, conspiracies postponed, perhaps even lives saved. And, if it ever got to an inquiry by SMERSH, which was unlikely as they were the sort of realistic people who cut their losses, it could only be assumed that some sheltering tramp had found the gold bar. \n Bond lifted the secret flap under the passenger seat and slipped the bar inside. Dangerous stuff. He would have to contact the next station of the Service and hand it over to them. They would get it back to London in the Embassy bag. Bond would have to report this quickly. It confirmed a lot. M might even want to warn the Deuxieme and have the bridge watched to see who came. But Bond hoped that would not happen. He didn\u0027t want a scare started just when he was getting close to Goldfinger. He wanted the skies over Gold-finger to be blue and clear. \n Bond got moving. Now there were other things to think about. He must catch up with the Rolls before Macon and get the next fork, to Geneva or Lyons, right. He must solve the problem of the girl and if possible get her off the road. Pretty or not, she was confusing the issue. And he must stop and buy himself something to eat and drink. It was one o\u0027clock and the sight of Goldfinger eating had made him hungry. And it was time to fill up and check the water and oil. \n The drone of the Homer grew louder. He was in the outskirts of Macon. He must close up and take the risk of being spotted. The busy traffic would hide his low-slung car. It was vital to know if the Rolls crossed the Saone for the Bourg road or if it turned right at the bridge and joined the N6 for Lyons. Far down the Rue Rambuteau there was a glimpse of yellow. Over the railway bridge and through the little square. The high yellow box kept on towards the river. Bond watched the passers-by turn their heads to follow the gleaming Rolls. The river. Would Goldfinger turn right or keep on across the bridge? The Rolls kept straight on. So it was Switzerland! Bond followed over into the suburb of St Laurent. Now for a butcher and a baker and a wine shop. A hundred yards ahead the golden head of a calf hung over the pavement. Bond glanced in his driving mirror. Well, well! The little Triumph was only feet away from his tail. How long had she been there? Bond had been so intent on following the Rolls that he hadn\u0027t glanced back since entering the town. She must have been hiding up a ^ide street. So! Now coincidence was certainly out. Something must be done. Sorry, sweetheart. I\u0027ve got to mess you up. I\u0027ll be as gentle as I can. Hold tight. Bond stopped abruptly in front of the butcher\u0027s shop. He banged the gears into reverse. There was a sickening scrunch and tinkle. Bond switched off his engine and got out. \n He walked round to the back of the car. The girl, her face tense with anger, had one beautiful silken leg on the road. There was an indiscreet glimpse\u0027 of white thigh. The girl stripped off her goggles and stood, legs braced and arms akimbo. The beautiful mouth was taut with anger. \n The Aston Martin\u0027s rear bumper was locked into the wreckage of the Triumph\u0027s lamps and radiator grille. Bond said amiably, \u0027If you touch me there again you\u0027ll have to marry me.\u0027 \n The words were hardly out of his mouth before the open palm cracked across his face. Bond put up a hand and rubbed his cheek. Now there was quite a crowd. There was a murmur of approval and ribaldry. \u0027Allez y la gosse! Main-tenant le knock-out!\u0027 \n The girl\u0027s rage had not dissipated with the blow. \u0027You bloody fool! What the hell do you think you\u0027re doing?\u0027 \n Bond thought: If only pretty girls were always angry they would be beautiful. He said, \u0027Your brakes can\u0027t be up to much.\u0027 \n \u0027My brakes! What the hell do you mean? You reversed into me.\u0027 \n \u0027Gears slipped. I didn\u0027t know you were so close.\u0027 It was time to calm her down. \u0027I\u0027m most frightfully sorry. I\u0027ll pay for all the repairs and everything. It really is bad luck. Let\u0027s see what the damage is. Try and back away. Doesn\u0027t look as if our bumpers have over-ridden.\u0027 Bond put a foot on the Triumph\u0027s bumpers and rocked. \n \u0027Don\u0027t you dare touch my car! Leave it alone.\u0027 Angrily the girl climbed back into the driver\u0027s seat. She pressed the self-starter. The engine fired. Metal clanged under the bonnet. She switched off and leant out. \u0027There you are, you idiot! You\u0027ve smashed the fan.\u0027 \n Bond had hoped he had. He got into his own car and eased it away from the Triumph. Bits of the Triumph, released by Bond\u0027s bumper, tinkled on to the road. He got out again. The crowd had thinned. There was a man in a mechanic\u0027s overalls. He volunteered to call a breakdown van and went off to do so. Bond walked over to the Triumph. The girl had got out and was waiting for him. Her expression had changed. Now she was more composed. Bond noticed that her eyes, which were dark blue, watched his face carefully. \n Bond said, \u0027It really won\u0027t be too bad. Probably knocked the fan out of alignment. They\u0027ll put temporary headlamps in the sockets and straighten up the chrome. You\u0027ll be off again by tomorrow morning. Now,\u0027 Bond reached into his pocket for his notecase,\u0027this is maddening for you and I\u0027ll certainly take all the blame. Here\u0027s a hundred thousand francs to cover the damage and your expenses for the night and telephoning your friends and so on. Please take it and call it quits. I\u0027d love to stay here and see you get on the road all right tomorrow morning. But I\u0027ve got an appointment this evening and I\u0027ve simply got to make it.\u0027 \n \u0027No.\u0027 The one word was cool, definite. The girl put her hands behind her back and waited. \n \u0027But…\u0027 What was it she wanted, the police? Have him charged with dangerous driving? \n \u0027I\u0027ve got an appointment this evening too. I\u0027ve got to make it. I\u0027ve got to get to Geneva. Will you please take me there? It\u0027s not far. Only about a hundred miles. We could do it in two hours in that.\u0027 She gestured at the DB III. \u0027Will you? Please?\u0027 \n There was a desperate urgency in the voice. No cajolery, no threats, only a blazing need. \n For the first time Bond examined her as more than a pretty girl who perhaps - they were the only explanations Bond had found to fit the facts - wanted to be picked up by Goldfinger or had a blackmail on him. But she didn\u0027t look capable of either of these things. There was too much character in the face, too much candour. And she wasn\u0027t wearing the uniform of a seductress. She wore a white, rather masculine cut, heavy silk shirt. It was open at the neck, but it would button up to a narrow military collar. The shirt had long wide sleeves gathered at the wrists. The girl\u0027s nails were unpainted and her only piece of jewellery was a gold ring on her engagement finger (true or false?). She wore a very wide black stitched leather belt with double brass buckles. It rose at the back to give some of the support of a racing driver\u0027s corset belt. Her short skirt was charcoal-grey and pleated. Her shoes were expensive-looking black sandals which would be comfortable and cool for driving. The only touch of colour was the pink handkerchief which she had taken off her head and now held by her side with the white goggles. It all looked very attractive. But the get-up reminded Bond more of an equipment than a young girl\u0027s dress. There was something faintly mannish and open-air about the whole of her behaviour and appearance. She might, thought Bond, be a member of the English women\u0027s ski team, or spend a lot of her time in England hunting or show-jumping. \n Although she was a very beautiful girl she was the kind who leaves her beauty alone. She had made no attempt to pat her hair into place. As a result, it looked as a girl\u0027s hair should look - untidy, with bits that strayed and a rather crooked parting. It provided the contrast of an uneven, jagged dark frame for the pale symmetry of the face, the main features of which were blue eyes under dark brows, a desirable mouth, and an air of determination and independence that came from the high cheek-bones and the fine line of the jaw. There was the same air of self-reliance in her figure. She held her body proudly - her fine breasts out-thrown and unashamed under the taut silk. Her stance, with feet slightly parted and hands behind her back, was a mixture of provocation and challenge. \n The whole picture seemed to say, \u0027Now then, you handsome bastard, don\u0027t think you can \"little woman\" me. You\u0027ve got me into this mess and, by God, you\u0027re going to get me out! You may be attractive, but I\u0027ve got my life to run, and I know where I\u0027m going.\u0027 \n Bond weighed her request. How much of a nuisance would she be? How soon could he get rid of her and get on with his business? Was there any security risk? Against the disadvantages, there was his curiosity about her and what she was up to, the memory of the fable he had spun round her and which had now taken its first step towards realization, and, finally, the damsel-in-distress business - any woman\u0027s appeal for help. \n Bond said curtly, \u0027I\u0027ll be glad to take you to Geneva. Now then,\u0027 he opened up the back of the Aston Martin, \u0027let\u0027s get your things in. While I fix up about the garage here\u0027s some money. Please buy us lunch - anything you like for yourself. For me, six inches of Lyon sausage, a loaf of bread, butter, and half a litre of Macon with the cork pulled.\u0027 \n Their eyes met and exchanged a flurry of masculine/feminine master/slave signals. The girl took the money. \u0027Thank you. I\u0027ll get the same things for myself.\u0027 She went to the boot of the Triumph and unlocked it. \u0027No, don\u0027t bother. I can manage these.\u0027 She hauled out a bag of golf clubs with a cover zipped shut and a small, expensive looking suitcase. She brought them over to the Aston Martin and, rejecting Bond\u0027s offer of help, fitted them in alongside Bond\u0027s suitcase. She watched him lock the back of the car and went back to the Triumph. She took out a wide, black-stitched leather shoulder bag. \n Bond said, \u0027What name and address shall I give?\u0027 \n \u0027What?\u0027 \n Bond repeated his question, wondering if she would lie about the name or the address, or both. \n She said, \u0027I shall be moving about. Better say the Bergues at Geneva. The name\u0027s Soames. Miss Tilly Soames.\u0027 There was no hesitation. She went into the butcher\u0027s shop. \n A quarter of an hour later they were on their way. \n The girl sat upright and kept her eyes on the road. The drone on the Homer was faint. The Rolls must have gained fifty miles. Bond hurried. They flashed through Bourg and over the river at Pont d\u0027Ain. Now they were in the foothills of the Jura and there were the S-bends of N84. Bond went at them as if he was competing in the Alpine Trials. After the girl had swayed against him twice she kept her hand on the handle on the dash and rode with the car as if she were his spare driver. Once, after a particularly sharp dry skid that almost took them over the side, Bond glanced at her profile. Her lips were parted and her nostrils slightly flared. The eyes were alight. She was enjoying herself. \n They came to the top of the pass and there was the run down towards the Swiss frontier. Now the Homer was sending out a steady howl. Bond thought, I must take it easy or we shall be running into them at the Customs. He put his hand under the dash and tuned the noise down. He pulled in to the side of the road. They sat in the car and ate a polite but almost silent picnic, neither making any attempt at conversation, both, it seemed, with other things on their minds. After ten minutes, Bond got going again. He sat relaxed, motoring easily down the curving road through the young whispering pines. \n The girl said, \u0027What\u0027s that noise?\u0027 \n \u0027Magneto whine. Gets worse when I hurry. Started at Orleans. Have to get it fixed tonight.\u0027 \n She seemed satisfied with this mumbo-jumbo. She said diffidently, \u0027Where are you heading for? I hope I haven\u0027t taken you very far out of your way.\u0027 \n Bond said in a friendly voice, \u0027Not at all. As a matter of fact, I\u0027m going to Geneva too. But I may not stop there tonight. May have to get on. Depends on my meeting. How long will you be there?\u0027 \n \u0027I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m playing golf. There\u0027s the Swiss Women\u0027s Open Championship at Divonne. I\u0027m not really that class, but I thought it would be good for me to try. Then I was going to play on some of the other courses.\u0027 \n Fair enough. No reason why it shouldn\u0027t be true. But Bond was certain it wasn\u0027t the whole truth. He said, \u0027Do you play a lot of golf? What\u0027s your home course?\u0027 \n \u0027Quite a lot. Temple.\u0027 \n It had been an obvious question. Was the answer true, or just the first golf course she had thought of? \u0027Do you live near there?\u0027 \n \u0027I\u0027ve got an aunt who lives at Henley. What are you doing in Switzerland. Holiday?\u0027 \n \u0027Business. Import and Export.\u0027 \n \u0027Oh.\u0027 \n Bond smiled to himself. It was a stage conversation. The voices were polite stage voices. He could see the scene, beloved of the English theatre - the drawing-room, sunshine on hollyhocks outside french windows, the couple sitting on the sofa, on the edge of it, she pouring out the tea. \u0027Do you take sugar?\" \n They came out into the foothills. There was a long straight stretch of road and in the distance the small group of buildings of the French Customs. \n The girl gave him no chance to get a glimpse of her passport. As soon as the car stopped she said something about tidying up and disappeared into the \u0027Dames\u0027. Bond had gone through the Controle and was dealing with the triptyque when she reappeared, her passport stamped. At the Swiss Customs she chose the excuse of getting something out of her suitcase. Bond hadn\u0027t got time to hang about and call her bluff. \n Bond hurried on into Geneva and pulled up at the imposing entrance of the Bergues. The baggagiste took her suitcase and golf clubs. They stood together on the steps. She held out her hand. \u0027Goodbye.\u0027 There was no melting of the candid blue eyes. \u0027And thank you. You drive beautifully.\u0027 Her mouth smiled. \u0027I\u0027m surprised you got into the wrong gear at Macon.\u0027 \n Bond shrugged. \u0027It doesn\u0027t often happen. I\u0027m glad I did. If I can get my business finished, perhaps we could meet again.\u0027 \n \u0027That would be nice.\u0027 The tone of voice said it wouldn\u0027t be. The girl turned and went in through the swingdoors. \n Bond ran down to his car. To hell with her! Now to pick up Goldfinger. Then to the little office on the Quai Wilson. He tuned the Homer and waited a couple of minutes. Gold-finger was close, but moving away. He could either be following the right or the left bank of the lake. From the pitch of the Homer, he was at least a mile outside the town. Which way? To the left towards Lausanne? To the right towards Evian? The DB III was already on the left-hand road. Bond decided to follow its nose. He got moving. \n Bond caught up with the high yellow silhouette just before \n Coppet, the tiny lakeside hamlet made famous by Madame de Stael. He hid behind a lorry. At his next reconnaissance the Rolls had disappeared. Bond motored on, watching to the left. At the entrance to the village, big solid iron gates were closing in a high wall. Dust hung in the air. Above the wall was a modest placard. It said, in faded yellow on blue, ENTREPRISES AURIC A.G. The fox had gone to earth! \n Bond went on until he found a turning to the left. He followed this until there was a lane which led back through the vineyards to the woods behind Coppet and to the chateau of Madame de Stael. Bond stopped among the trees. Now he should be directly above the Entreprises Auric. He took his binoculars, got out and followed a foot-path down towards the village. Soon, on his right, was a spiked iron railing. There was rolled barbed wire along its top. A hundred yards lower down the hill the railing merged into a high stone wall. Bond walked slowly back up the path looking for the secret entrance the children of Coppet would have made to get at the chestnut trees. He found it - two bars of the railing widened to allow a small body through. Bond stood on the lower railing with all his weight, widened the gap by another couple of inches and wormed his way through. \n Bond walked warily through the trees, watching each step for dead branches. The trees thinned. There were glimpses of a huddle of low buildings behind a small manoir. Bond picked the thick trunk of a fir tree and got behind it. Now he was looking down on the buildings. The nearest was about a hundred yards away. There was an open courtyard. In the middle of the courtyard stood the dusty Silver Ghost. \n Bond took out the binoculars and examined everything minutely. \n The house was a well-proportioned square block of old red brick with a slate roof. It consisted of two storeys and an attic floor. It would probably contain four bedrooms and two principal rooms. The walls were partly covered by a very old wistaria in full bloom. It was an attractive house. In his mind\u0027s eye Bond could see the white-painted panelling inside. He smelled the sweet musty sunshiny smell of the rooms. The back door gave on to the wide paved courtyard in which stood the Rolls. The courtyard was open on Bond\u0027s side but closed on the other two sides by single-storey corrugated iron workshops. A tall zinc chimney rose from the angle of the two workshops. The chimney was topped by a zinc cowl. On top of the zinc cowl was the revolving square mouth of what looked to Bond like a Decca radar scanner you see on the bridges of most ships. The apparatus whirled steadily round. Bond couldn\u0027t imagine what purpose it served on the roof of this little factory among the trees. \n Suddenly the silence and immobility of the peaceful scene were broken. It was as if Bond had put a penny in the slot of a diorama on Brighton pier. Somewhere a tinny clock struck five. At the signal, the back door of the house opened and Goldfinger came out, still dressed in his white linen motoring coat, but without the helmet. He was followed by a nondescript, obsequious little man with a toothbrush moustache and horn-rimmed spectacles. Goldfinger looked pleased. He went up to the Rolls and patted its bonnet. The other man laughed politely. He took a whistle out of his waistcoat pocket and blew it. A door in the right-hand workshop opened and four workmen in blue overalls filed out and walked over to the car. From the open door they had left there came a whirring noise and a heavy engine started up and settled into the rhythmic pant Bond remembered from Reculver. \n The four men disposed themselves round the car. At a word from the little man, who was presumably the foreman, they began to take the car to pieces. \n By the time they had lifted the four doors off their hinges, removed the bonnet cover from the engine and had set about the rivets on one of the mudguards, it was clear that they were methodically stripping the car of its armour plating. \n Almost as soon as Bond had come to this conclusion, the black, bowler-hatted figure of Oddjob appeared at the back door of the house and made some sort of a noise at Gold-finger. With a word to the foreman, Goldfinger went indoors and left the workmen to it. \n It was time for Bond to get going. He took a last careful look round to fix the geography in his mind and edged back among the trees. \n \u0027I am from Universal Export.\u0027 \n \u0027Oh yes?\u0027 Behind the desk there was a reproduction of the Annigoni portrait of the Queen. On the other walls were advertisements for Ferguson tractors and other agricultural machinery. From outside the wide window came the hum of traffic along the Quai Wilson. A steamer hooted. Bond glanced out of the window and watched it ride across the middle distance. It left an enchanted wake across the flawless evening mirror of the lake. Bond looked back into the politely inquiring eyes in the bland, neutral, businessman\u0027s face. \n \u0027We were hoping to do business with you.\" \n \u0027What sort of business?\u0027 \n \u0027Important business.\u0027 \n The man\u0027s face broke into a smile. He said cheerfully, \u0027It\u0027s 007, isn\u0027t it? Thought I recognized you. Well now, what can I do for you?\u0027 The voice became cautious. \u0027Only one thing, better make it quick and get along. There\u0027s been the hell of a heat on since the Dumont business. They\u0027ve got me taped -the locals and Redland. All very peaceful of course, but you won\u0027t want them sniffing round you.\u0027 \n \u0027I thought it might be like that. It\u0027s only routine. Here.\u0027 Bond unbuttoned his shirt and took out the heavy chunk of gold. \u0027Get that back, would you? And transmit this when you have a chance.\u0027 The man pulled a pad towards him and wrote in shorthand to Bond\u0027s dictation. \n When the man had finished he put the pad in his pocket. \u0027Well, well! Pretty hot stuff. Wilco. My routine\u0027s at midnight. This\u0027 - he indicated the gold - \u0027can go to Berne for the bag. Anything else?\u0027 \n \u0027Ever heard of the \"Entreprises Auric\" at Coppet? Know what they do?\u0027 \n \u0027I know what every engineering business in the area does. Have to. Tried to sell them some hand riveters last year. They make metal furniture. Pretty good stuff. The Swiss railways take some of it, and the airlines.\u0027 \n \u0027Know which airlines?\u0027 \n The man shrugged. \u0027I heard they did all the work for Mecca, the big charter line to India. Their terminus is Geneva. They\u0027re quite a big competitor with All-India. Mecca\u0027s privately owned. Matter of fact, I did hear that ? Auric \u0026 Co. had some money in it. No wonder they\u0027ve got the contract for the seating.\u0027 \n A slow, grim smile spread across Bond\u0027s face. He got up and held out his hand. \u0027You don\u0027t know it, but you\u0027ve just done a whole jigsaw puzzle in under a minute. Many thanks. \n Best of luck with the tractor business. Hope we\u0027ll meet again one day.\u0027 \n Out in the street, Bond got quickly into his car and drove along the quai to the Bergues. So that was the picture! For two days he\u0027d been trailing a Silver Ghost across Europe. It was an armour-plated Silver Ghost. He\u0027d watched the last bit of plating being riveted on in Kent, and the whole lot being stripped off at Coppet. Those sheets would already be in the furnaces at Coppet, ready to be modelled into seventy chairs for a Mecca Constellation. In a few days\u0027 time those chairs would be stripped off the plane in India and replaced with aluminium ones. And Goldfinger would have made what? Half a million pounds? A million? \n For the Silver Ghost wasn\u0027t silver at all. It was a Golden Ghost - all the two tons of its bodywork. Solid, eighteen-carat, white gold. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1564/46389.html","bookId":1276,"book":{"id":1276,"title":"007之Goldfinger 金手指","description":"简介： 世界各国突然出现黄金的大量流失,黄金的黑市交易十分兴盛.虽然各国都对金锭做有记号,可是,经过融化重铸后就毫无迹象可寻.政府部门怀疑巨富金手指参与了黑市黄金交易,因为他作为国际商人可以合法拥有并使用大型铸造设备.他在日内瓦拥有一座大银行,各国都有大量黄金储备在...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201605/24/10-51-50-20-1.jpg","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1564","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:47 AM"}}
