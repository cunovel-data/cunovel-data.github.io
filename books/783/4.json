{"id":34534,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER III IN A FRESH SCRAPE","content":"The first witness called by Mr. Faulkner was Captain Downes. \"Will you tell us what you know about this affair?\" the chairman said. \"After having captured the smuggler, I took six men and went up to see if I could be of any assistance to Mr. Moorsby, and also to hear whether he had been as successful with his capture as I had. I found that everything was over, and that a fire had been lighted. I was talking to Mr. Moorsby when my attention was excited by loud words between Mr. Faulkner and Mr. Wyatt, with whom I am acquainted. Mr. Faulkner struck him in the face, and there was a scuffle, the prisoner lifting the magistrate, although a much heavier man, completely off his feet. In the course of the scuffle they approached the fire, and being afraid that they might fall into it, I ran up with Mr. Moorsby and some of the men, and pulled them away.\" \"Did it seem to you, Captain Downes, that the prisoner was carrying Mr. Faulkner straight to the fire?\" \"He was certainly going straight in that direction, but whether intentionally or not I am unable to say.\" \"Do you think that if you and your men had not interfered they would have fallen into the fire?\" \"I think they would certainly have done so.\" \"Do you think that the prisoner intended to throw Mr. Faulkner into the fire?\" \"That I cannot say.\" \"Have you any questions to ask the witness, Mr. Faulkner?\" the chairman asked. \"You do not think it likely, I suppose, that the prisoner could have intended himself to tumble into the fire?\" \"I should think it very unlikely.\" Mr. Faulkner sat down, and Mr. Probert rose. \"You think it very unlikely, Captain Downes, that Mr. Wyatt would deliberately have walked into the fire, and I quite share your opinion; but it has not yet been proved that he was deliberately going towards the fire at all. You say he lifted Mr. Faulkner in his arms. Now it seems to me that, having done so, he would not be able to see at all which way he was going, as Mr. Wyatt\u0027s eyes would both be on a level with Mr. Faulkner\u0027s chest; moreover, it must be evident that, judging from his present appearance, he could scarcely have seen anything at all, after receiving such a blow. Does it not strike you as being still more likely that, partially blinded as he was, and being unwilling to strike the magistrate in return, however much the latter had forfeited all claim to respect, he closed with him, and in the heat of passion lifted him up and carried him along at random?\" \"I think that very likely,\" the lieutenant replied. \"Had you yourself been struck as the prisoner was struck, Captain Downes, what course do you think it would have been proper for you to pursue?\" \"I don\u0027t know what would have been proper, but I know what I should have done. Magistrate or no magistrate, I should have knocked my assailant down, or at any rate I should have tried to.\" \"As a naval man, Captain Downes, you have had some experience of the conduct gentlemen generally observe to their prisoners. I presume that it is not their custom to strike them, even if they did make a somewhat free use of their tongues?\" \"Certainly not,\" Captain Downes said emphatically. \"Would you go so far as to say that you would consider it to be a disgraceful and cowardly act?\" \"I should so consider it.\" There was again a murmur of applause in court, which was instantly arrested when Mr. Probert held up his hand deprecatingly. \"Thank you, Captain Downes,\" he went on. \"Now we come to the question of the quarrel that gave rise to this affair. Mr. Faulkner has not thought fit to ask you any questions about it. Were you standing close enough to hear what passed?\" \"I was standing close by, and both Mr. Faulkner and the prisoner spoke loudly enough to be heard at such a distance.\" \"The magistrate first began the conversation?\" \"He did.\" \"He used very strong language, did he not?\" \"Very strong.\" \"Did you think that he was justified in using such strong language?\" \"Certainly not; I thought that it was most improper.\" \"And do you think that a gentleman accosted so improperly is to be greatly blamed if he uses strong language in return?\" \"It would no doubt have been better if he had held his tongue at the time, and have called him to account afterwards.\" \"Still the provocation was very strong, Captain Downes, and you could not altogether blame him.\" \"I did not blame him at all,\" the witness said curtly. \"And what did you think when Mr. Faulkner suddenly struck his prisoner in the face?\" \"Am I to answer that question?\" the witness asked the bench. \"I do not think that it is an improper question,\" the chairman replied. \"Very well, sir. Then, if I must say it, I thought it was one of the most blackguardly and cowardly things I ever saw done.\" \"Thank you, Captain Downes. I do not think it necessary to ask you any further questions.\" \"Have you any more witnesses to call, Mr. Faulkner?\" the chairman asked coldly. Mr. Faulkner\u0027s face was white with rage. \"I have a dozen other witnesses,\" he said hoarsely, \"but I have no doubt they will all follow the lead their officer has set them. I shall therefore call no more.\" \"I do not think, your worships,\" Mr. Probert said, rising, \"that it is necessary for me to address you. I would only submit to you that there is not a shadow of evidence to support the charge of an attempt to murder. As to the abusive language, I cannot say that my client\u0027s words were a retort courteous, but they were only a retort natural, and were simply the consequence of the extraordinary conduct of Mr. Faulkner, acting at the time in his capacity of magistrate. As to the charge of threatening language, it is altogether absurd. My client simply asserted what is true by common report—that Mr. Faulkner had been threatened, and that it was possible that those threats might some day or other be carried into effect. I have only, therefore, to leave the case in the hands of your worships.\" The two magistrates put their heads together for a short time. Then the chairman said: \"The bench is of opinion that the charge of attempted murder is altogether without foundation, and that of abusive language and the use of threats should never have been brought, seeing that they were the result of what we cannot but consider the very ill-judged and improper conduct of the plaintiff. You are therefore discharged, Mr. Wyatt; but my colleague and myself cannot but again express a hope that this and the preceding charge may prove a lesson to you to avoid taking part, even as a spectator, in such breeches of the law as those which led to this very regrettable occurrence.\" As the magistrate concluded, a roar of applause rose in the court. In vain the constables shouted for silence. The chairman at once ordered the room to be cleared, and at the same time motioned to Julian not to leave the court, as he was preparing to do. When the court was cleared, he called Julian up to him. \"I think, Mr. Wyatt,\" he said, \"it would be as well for you to remain here for a time, and then go out by the back way. It would be very unfortunate if any demonstration took place. Enough harm has been done already; do not let us make it any worse.\" \"Certainly not, sir. I am heartily sorry for what has occurred,\" and beckoning to Frank, who was still seated at the solicitors\u0027 table, he retired with him to a waiting-room. \"Thank goodness, Julian, you have got out of that scrape.\" \"Thank goodness, indeed, Frank. I behaved like an awful fool, but I never dreamt that anything like this would come of it. I have been to see cargoes run several times. It was very good fun. I never helped in any way, and had always made up my mind that I would make myself scarce if the revenue people should turn up, but it all happened so suddenly that I was a prisoner before I knew what was going on. As to the other affair, no doubt it would have been better for me to have said nothing, but of course I knew that he had no right to say what he did, and I had not the least idea that he would hit me; when he did, I went at him in a fury, and I don\u0027t mind acknowledging that I did intend to chuck him in the fire—not with any idea of killing him, you know, though I did think he would be burnt a bit.\" \"It was lucky you sent for Probert, Julian; I had never thought of it.\" \"No more did I, Frank. I was perfectly astonished when he got up and said that he appeared for me, but I supposed that Aunt or you had sent for him.\" \"I am sure Aunt didn\u0027t, or she would have told me.\" \"I should not be surprised, Frank, if it were Captain Downes. In the first place, he was a friend of Father\u0027s, and in the next place, because he is heartily sick of Faulkner\u0027s constant interference and the way he goes on. I expect that if Mr. Moorsby had got up he would have said just the same things.\" \"I will leave you here for a few minutes, Julian. I must run round and tell Aunt; she is in a fearful stew about you.\" Frank ran out at the main entrance. A number of fishermen were hanging about outside. Bill came up to him: \"Isn\u0027t Mr. Julian coming out, Master Frank?\" \"Not at present. The magistrates don\u0027t want any fuss in the streets, no more does my brother, and he will stay there till every one has cleared off, so the best thing you can do, Bill, is to persuade the others to go off home. Julian knows well enough that you are all pleased that he has got off, but you see if there were a fuss got up about it in the streets it would do him harm and not good.\" \"All right, sir, I will get them off. They just wanted to give him a cheer.\" \"Well, they did that in Court, Bill, and you know that he appreciates their good intentions. Well, I must be off.\" Mrs. Troutbeck was still on the watch. However, she did not come to the door. Frank opened it, and ran into the parlour. His Aunt had dropped into a chair, with her handkerchief to her eyes. \"So he has not come back with you, Frank. It is dreadful. What are they going to do with him?\" \"They are not going to do anything, Aunt. He has been acquitted. Only he did not come home with me because there are a lot of sailors waiting outside to cheer him, and the magistrates did not want a row over him, nor did Julian either. I have just run home to tell you that it is all right, and now I am going back for him. I expect by the time I get there they will all have gone, and we may be home in a quarter of an hour, so I think, Aunt, the best thing you can do is to get tea ready, for I don\u0027t expect he has had much to eat there, or any appetite to eat it.\" It was good advice, for Mrs. Troutbeck was on the point of going into hysterics from joy and relief. However, the thought of the necessity for getting a good meal to welcome Julian on his arrival turned her thoughts into another channel, and, wiping her eyes hastily, she rose and gave directions, while Frank started again for the court-house. The fishermen had left, but there were still a number of boys about the place. The private entrance was, however, free from observers, and the brothers started at once, keeping to the back streets until they neared the house. \"My dear Julian,\" Mrs. Troutbeck exclaimed as she threw her arms round his neck, \"what a relief it is to have you back again. It has been terrible for you.\" \"It hasn\u0027t been very pleasant, Aunt,\" he replied cheerfully, \"but it is all right now, and certainly I ought not to grumble. I have had better luck than I deserved. I was a fool to go there, but I did not think that there was any real chance of the revenue people coming down upon us. It was thought they had been thrown off the scent altogether.\" \"What a dreadful face you have got, Julian!\" \"Oh, that is nothing, Aunt; it will go off in a few days, and until it has I must either stay indoors or keep out of the town altogether.\" \"I am afraid tea won\u0027t be ready for a few minutes, Julian. You see I have had such a very short notice.\" \"I can hold on comfortably, Aunt; besides, I have got to have a change and a wash. That is of more importance than tea just at present.\" After the meal was over, Frank gave the details of the examination, the narrative being very frequently stopped by exclamations and questions on the part of Mrs. Troutbeck. \"I have never heard of such a wicked thing. The idea of that man charging you with attempting to murder him! Julian, he ought to be punished for it.\" \"I fancy he has been punished, Aunt. I don\u0027t see how he is to keep his commission as a justice after what was said in court. Still, it is a bad thing for me. I was discharged, but it will always be against me. If I ever get into any sort of trouble again, people will say: \u0027Ah, yes; he was charged with attempting murder when he was a young fellow, and although he was lucky enough to get off then, there must have been something in it. He is evidently a man of ungovernable temper.\u0027\" \"But, my dear Julian, everyone knows that you have a very sweet temper.\" \"I was not in a sweet temper then at any rate, Aunt.\" \"Of course not, Julian. I should not have been so myself if anyone had hit me such a terrible blow as that in the face.\" Her nephews both laughed, for they had never seen her ruffled out of her usual serenity. \"Well, Aunt, don\u0027t let us talk any more about it,\" Julian said. \"I would give a good deal if it hadn\u0027t happened. As it is, one must make the best of it, and I hope that it will be forgotten in time. I wish now that I had gone into the army, but it is too late for that. I shall think over what I had best take to. I should certainly like to get away from here until it has blown over altogether.\" On the following morning Frank met Captain Downes, and learned that he was right in his conjecture, and that it was he who had retained Mr. Probert\u0027s services in Julian\u0027s behalf before the magistrates. For the next few days Julian kept in the house, except that after nightfall he went out for a long walk. The report of the proceedings in the court had caused a great sensation in Weymouth, and the feeling was so strong against Mr. Faulkner that he was hooted in the streets when he rode into the town. The general expectation was that he would resign his position on the bench; and when at the end of a week he did not do so, a private meeting of the other magistrates was held, and it was whispered in the town that a report of the proceedings at the court had been sent to the Home Secretary, with an expression of opinion that Mr. Faulkner\u0027s brother magistrates felt that they could not sit again with him on the bench after what had taken place. Ten days after the affair Julian started early one morning for a day\u0027s rabbit-shooting at the house of a friend who lived some six miles up the valley. Some snow fell in the course of the afternoon and put a stop to shooting, and he started to walk home. When he was within a few hundred yards of Mr. Faulkner\u0027s place he heard a horse coming along behind him. The snow that had fallen had deadened the sound of the hoofs on the road, and, looking round, he saw Mr. Faulkner riding fast, at a distance of but fifty yards away. Had he caught sight of him sooner Julian would have left the road and entered the wood to avoid him, but it was too late now, and he hoped that at any rate the man would pass on without speaking. The horseman had apparently not recognized Julian until he came abreast of him, when, with a sudden exclamation, he reined in his horse. threat \"MARK MY WORDS, YOU YOUNG SCOUNDREL, I WILL BE EVEN WITH YOU YET.\" \"So it is you, Julian Wyatt?\" he said, in a tone of suppressed fury. \"It is I, Mr. Faulkner,\" Julian replied quietly; \"and as I don\u0027t want to have anything to say to you, I think that you had better go on your way without interfering with me.\" \"Mark my words, you young scoundrel, I will be even with you yet.\" \"The debt is not all on your side, Mr. Faulkner. I, too, have got a debt to pay; and perhaps some day we may square matters up, when you have not got a score of coast-guardsmen at your back. However, I am content to leave matters as they are so long as you do the same. As to your owing a debt to me, it is yourself you have to thank for the trouble you have got into; it was no doing of mine. However, I warn you that you had better abstain from insulting me again. I did not strike you back when you hit me last time, but if you call me scoundrel again you shall see that I can hit as hard as you can, and I will teach you to keep a civil tongue in your head.\" \"You mark my words,\" Mr. Faulkner repeated. \"I will have you watched, and I will hunt you down, and if I am not mistaken I will put a rope round your neck one of these days.\" So saying, he struck spurs into his horse and galloped on. Julian stood looking after him until he saw him turn in at his gate. The drive to the house led, as he knew, diagonally through the wood, and as he walked forward he heard the horse\u0027s galloping hoofs grow louder and louder. Suddenly there was the report of a gun some seventy or eighty yards away. It was mingled with that of a sudden cry, and Julian heard the horse galloping on even faster than before. With an exclamation of \"Good heavens! something has happened!\" he broke through the hedge and ran in the direction of the sound. As he approached it he thought that he caught sight of a man running through the trees, but he kept straight on until he came upon the drive. Twenty yards away Mr. Faulkner lay stretched on the ground. He went up to him, and stooped over him. His eyes were closed, and as he lay on his back Julian saw blood oozing through a bullet-hole in his coat high up on the left side of the chest. Feeling sure that Mr. Faulkner was dead he started up, and without a moment\u0027s hesitation ran into the wood again, in the direction where he had thought that he had seen a figure. A minute later he came upon some footprints on a bare spot between the trees, where the snow had fallen lightly. Noting the direction they took, he followed at once. He saw no more signs of footprints, but followed the direction as nearly as he could until he came to the farthest side of the wood; then he leaped out into the field beyond, and followed the edge of the wood until he again reached the road. He then turned and went back again, and fifty yards from the point where he had first run out he came upon the footprints again. \"He was going to take to the hills, he muttered,\" as he set off along the track. He ran at a trot, and as he went, loaded both barrels of his gun. \"Very likely the villain will show fight,\" he said to himself; \"I must take him by surprise if I can.\" After a quarter of a mile\u0027s run he reached the foot of the hill, and near its crest, three-quarters of a mile away, caught sight of the figure of a man. A moment later he had passed over the crest. Julian started at full speed up the hill. There was no need to follow the footprints now; indeed the strong wind that was blowing had swept the snow into the hollows, and the face of the hill was bare. When he reached the top of the hill he had decreased his distance considerably. He saw to his surprise that the man was bearing to the right, a course that would ere long bring him to the edge of the cliff. The run up the hill had left him breathless, and for some time the man, who was also running, fully maintained his lead. Then Julian began to gain upon him. The man had again changed his course, and was now going parallel with the line of cliffs. Three miles from the point where he had reached the top Julian was within a quarter of a mile of him. He would have caught him before this, had he not been obliged at times to make detours so as to avoid passing high ground, where the man, if he looked back, would have perceived him. By this time he was almost sure that the fugitive was a poacher, who had been recently released from a term of two years in prison for poaching in Mr. Faulkner\u0027s preserves. At last he saw him turn sharp to the right again. \"Where on earth is he going?\" Julian said to himself. \"The cliffs are not many hundred yards away.\" Hitherto he had supposed that the man was keeping away from the cliff to avoid meeting any of the coast-guards who would be on duty there, but this change of direction puzzled him completely. Keeping his eye on the poacher, he saw him enter a small clump of bushes, from which he did not emerge. Julian at once slackened his pace down to a walk. It was likely enough that the man had noticed that he was being pursued, and had determined to rid himself of the pursuer. It was not a pleasant idea, that the fellow might now be kneeling among the bushes with his gun at his shoulder. \"It could hardly be that either,\" he said to himself, \"for if he intended to shoot me he would have turned the other way; for the sound of his gun would be probably heard by some of the coast-guard, and they could not fail to see him running away. At any rate,\" he muttered, \"I am not going to turn back after such a chase as I have had.\" Standing still and looking at the spot, he saw that the clump of bushes grew in a slight hollow, and that by turning to the right he would be able to approach within twenty or thirty yards of it without exposing himself to view. This he did, and in a short time lost sight of the bushes. Moving with great caution, he made his way towards them, and when he approached the slope into the hollow, lay down and crawled along, keeping his gun in front of him. As he neared the spot he lay down on his stomach in the short turf and wound himself along until he could see down into the bushes. With his gun at his shoulder, and his finger on the trigger, he gazed down into the hollow. To his surprise he could see no signs of the fugitive. The leafless boughs afforded but slight shelter, and after gazing fixedly at them for two or three minutes, he became convinced that the man was no longer there. As soon as he came to this conclusion he stood up and looked over the surrounding country. It was bleak and bare, and entirely destitute of hedges or any other shelter. It was but for five or six minutes at the utmost that he had lost sight of the bushes, and in that time the man could not have got far. \"Where on earth has he hidden himself?\" Julian muttered. He went down to the clump of bushes, still holding his gun in readiness for instant use. The patch was but some thirty feet long by half as wide. He walked backwards and forwards among the low bushes, but the fugitive was certainly not there. Going to the end of the patch he could see plainly enough the track where the man had entered, for although there was little snow on the top of the ground it lay among the tufts of grass. He walked round the clump, but there were no signs of any footsteps leaving it. \"This is the rummest thing I ever saw,\" he muttered; \"the fellow can\u0027t have flown away; yet, he certainly has not walked off.\" Thinking it over, an idea suddenly occurred to him. When sailing along the coast with Bill, the latter had one day pointed out to him a hole in the cliff some twenty feet above high-water mark. \"Do you see that hole, Mr. Julian?\" \"Yes, I see it plain enough. What of it?\" \"Well, sir, if I owned all the goods that have been taken into that hole on dark still nights I should be a rich man.\" \"Do you mean to say that they run cargoes there, Bill?\" \"Not kegs—they are too heavy and too awkward to get away—but laces, and silks, and such like. Many a lugger when she comes from abroad lands all them sorts of things here, and then sails away and takes her chance of running the rest of the cargo somewhere else.\" \"But how can anyone get up there? I see nothing like a path.\" \"There ain\u0027t no path, sir. The revenue men would have found it out long ago if there had been. The boat comes along, as I said, of a dark night, when there is no swell on, and the chaps inside show a tiny light to guide them to the spot. When the boat comes, they lower a rope down and haul the bales up; and then the boat goes back to the lugger, and she ups sail, and no one is the wiser.\" \"But what do they do with the stuff? I don\u0027t mean, where do they stow it, but how do they get it away?\" \"There is a passage somewhere,\" Bill replied. \"I don\u0027t know where it goes out. I reckon there ain\u0027t half a dozen men in Weymouth who do know. I should say, except the men whose business it is to take the goods inland and forward them to London, there is only one chap who is in the secret; and he is not in Weymouth now—he is in jail. That is Joe Markham. He is in for poaching. But for a good many years he sailed in one of those French luggers. Then, as I have heard, he was keeper of the cave for a bit; but he had to give it up—he was too well known to the coast-guard, and they kept too sharp an eye on him for him to venture to go out. He had had enough of the sea, and no doubt he had got some money laid by; anyhow, he took a cottage by the river, and took to poaching, more for devilment, I should say, than because he wanted the money. I expect he was well paid by the smugglers, for he used to get up half the stories to put them off the scent, and never missed being present when a run was made.\" This conversation came back to Julian\u0027s memory, as he stood by the clump of bushes wondering what had become of the man that he had pursued, and it flashed upon him that the spot where he was standing could not be far from the smugglers\u0027 cavern, and that the entrance to this might very well be among these bushes. The man knew where that entrance was, and nothing was more likely than that he should make for it as a place of concealment until an opportunity occurred to get on board a lugger and cross the channel. It was a very likely place; men could come and go at night without risk of being seen or heard by any of the coast-guardsmen on the cliff, and would not be likely to encounter anyone within two or three miles of it. Years might pass without anyone happening to enter the bushes. Laying down his gun, Julian began to search in earnest. It was half an hour before, feeling about in the coarse grass, he came upon a handle. He pulled at it, gently at first, then as it did not yield, he exerted his strength, and it gave way, and a section of the rough herbage rose, while three feet away it sank in the same proportion. Raising it higher, he saw that the trap-door—for such it was—was two feet wide by about five feet long and eighteen inches deep; it was, in fact, a deep tray pivoted on the centre and filled with earth, on which grass grew as freely as in the ground adjoining. The greater portion of the trap was overhung by bushes, which grew so thickly around the part which sank that the probability was small indeed that anyone would tread upon it. Julian saw, too, that under the handle was a bolt that, when fastened, would hold the trap firmly down. No doubt the man in his haste had forgotten to fasten it before he descended. Looking down, Julian saw a circular hole like a well, evidently artificially made in the chalk; a ladder was fastened against one side. prisoner JULIAN FINDS HIMSELF A PRISONER AMONG THE SMUGGLERS. Julian hesitated. Should he return to Weymouth, inform the authorities that he had traced the murderer of Mr. Faulkner to a place of concealment, and bring them there to arrest him, or should he go down and encounter him single-handed? Although of a fearless disposition, he would have decided on the more prudent course had it not been that to have done so, would have let the authorities into the knowledge of the smugglers\u0027 cave. Although he had determined to have nothing more to do with them, this he felt would be an act of treachery, for it was only because he had been believed by Bill to be absolutely trustworthy, that the latter had told him of the existence of this cavern and of the secret exit, and without that information he would never have searched for and discovered the trap-door. Then, too, the thought that the credit he would gain by the capture of the murderer single-handed would go far to efface the memory of the disgrace that had befallen him, helped to decide him. He fetched his gun and slung it over his shoulder, got upon the ladder, and pulled the trap-door down behind him. As he did so he found that it moved easily, and that he could push it up again without any difficulty, and feeling the bolt, discovered that it had been partially shot, but not sufficiently to catch fairly, although containing so far a hold of the frame, that it had torn a groove in the somewhat rotten wood with the force that he had used to raise it. He went down the ladder very cautiously, until, after descending for some thirty steps, his foot encountered solid ground. After a moment\u0027s consideration he knelt down and proceeded on his hands and knees. Almost immediately he felt the ground slope away in front of him. He got on to his feet again. Holding out his arms he found that the passage was about four feet wide, and he began to descend with extreme care, feeling his way along both walls. He had gone, he thought, about fifty yards when the passage made a sharp turn, still descending, and at a considerable distance ahead the light streamed in through a rugged hole. He walked more confidently now, and soon the light was sufficient to enable him to see the path he was following. On arriving at the aperture, he saw that, as he expected, he was looking over the sea. On one side of the hole there was a shelf cut in the chalk. This was stained as if by oil, and he guessed at once that it was a look-out and a spot for signalling a craft in the offing. The path here turned again and ran parallel with the face of the cliff. There was no occasion to exercise care in walking now, as here and there the light streamed in through openings a few inches long. He now unslung his gun, stooped and took off his boots, and then proceeded noiselessly. The descent was considerable, and in some places steps had been cut. At last he arrived at a door. It was roughly but very solidly made, and would doubtless sustain an attack for some time before it yielded, and so would give time to the occupants, in case the trap-door was discovered, to make their escape by the lower entrance on to the beach. There was a latch to it. Lifting this quietly, he found the door yielded, and, holding his gun in his right hand ready to cover the fugitive the moment he entered, Julian threw the door wide open and sprang forward. He had not calculated on a further descent, but the floor of the cave was five feet below him, and he fell heavily upon it, the gun going off as it struck the floor. Instantaneous as the fall had been, his eyes had taken in the scene. Several lanterns faintly lit up the cave; while in the centre a table, at which several figures were sitting, was illuminated by three or four candles. He was partly stunned by the heaviness of his fall, but vaguely heard shouts of surprise and alarm, and was, a minute later, roughly seized and dragged along. Then he felt that he was being tightly bound. For some minutes he was left to himself, but he could see three men with guns in their hands standing near the door by which he had entered, listening attentively. Presently he heard steps coming down the passage and two other men came through the door, shut and bolted it carefully, and then came down the steps into the cabin. They spoke to their comrades as they came in, and the news was evidently satisfactory, for the men leaned their guns against the wall and came to the table. There was some talk for a few minutes, and then Julian was raised and placed in a sitting position on the head of a cask by the table. One of the men then addressed him in French. Julian, who by this time had recovered from the effects of his fall, shook his head. The other then spoke to the poacher, who had seated himself opposite Julian, and the latter then said: \"You are the young fellow who was tried in court three weeks ago, are you not?\" \"Yes, I am.\" \"I thought so; I was there. It was the very day I got to Weymouth. Well, what the deuce are you doing here? You are the chap who has followed me all the way up the hill?\" Julian nodded. \"What did you follow me for?\" \"Because I was in the road when you shot Faulkner. I heard the gun, and ran in and found him dead. I caught sight of you in the wood, and went in chase of you.\" \"What did you intend to do, you young fool?\" \"I intended to capture you,\" Julian said fearlessly. \"What for? I have done you a good service as well as myself. You had no reason to bear him any good-will, and some of the men who were there told me that though Downes got you off, it was true that you were going to throw Faulkner into the fire.\" \"So I was; but he had just struck me and I was in a furious passion; but that was a different thing altogether to shooting a man in cold blood.\" \"He got me two years\u0027 imprisonment,\" the man said, \"which to my mind was a good reason for shooting him when I got the chance; and another thing was he would never leave us alone, but was always on our heels. There are two or three men in prison now that he got sent there, and eight more are waiting their trial. He made war on us, and I have turned the tables on him. \"I heard that you had been at several of the runs, and of course you are in with some of our fellows. How did you get to know about the entrance to this place?\" \"I only knew that there was a cave here, that it was used by the smugglers, and that it had an entrance somewhere.
