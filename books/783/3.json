{"id":34533,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II BEFORE THE JUSTICES","content":"One morning when Frank was dressing, the servant came up and told him that a fisherman, who said his name was Bill Bostock, wanted to speak to him. As he had often been out with Julian in the man\u0027s boat, he put on his jacket and ran to the door. \"Good morning, Bill!\" he said; \"what is it?\" \"I will talk with you outside, sir, if you don\u0027t mind.\" A good deal surprised Frank put on his cap and went out with him. \"There has been a bad business, Master Frank, a mighty bad job.\" \"What sort of a job, Bill?\" \"A smuggling affair, Master Frank. There was a fight. I hears one of the revenue men was killed. I don\u0027t know as that is so, but some of them have been knocked about, and have got some pistol wounds, no doubt. But that ain\u0027t the worst part of the business. Mr. Julian is among those as has been caught.\" \"Julian!\" Frank exclaimed in astonishment. \"Why, what in the world had Julian got to do with it?\" \"Well, sir,\" the sailor said apologetically, \"you see it was like this. Mr. Julian is a young gentleman as loves a bit of a spree, and he has been out many a night with some of us to see a cargo run.\" Frank uttered an exclamation of surprise and consternation. \"I thought perhaps as you knowed it, sir.\" \"I never dreamt of such a thing, Bill. How could Julian have been so mad as to mix himself up in such a business? I suppose this is your doing; you must have led him into this mischief.\" \"No, sir,\" the sailor said in an aggrieved voice. \"How was I to lead a young gentleman like your brother into a thing as he didn\u0027t choose to do? I don\u0027t say as I didn\u0027t mention to him, promiscuous like, that I lent a hand some times in running a cargo; but how was I to know as he would up and say, \u0027I will go with you some night, Bill.\u0027 Well, I argues with him, and I points out to him as he might get into a scrape; but, says he, \u0027I am not going to take no share in it, but just want to look on and see the fun,\u0027 as he calls it. I points out to him as it was not always fun, but he puts that aside, and, says he, it would not be fun unless there was a little excitement about it. He promised me faithful that he would always cut and run as soon as he heard there was any talk of the revenue men a-coming, and what was I to do? I don\u0027t say, sir, as how if it had been you I would have taken you with me, \u0027cause you are young, you see, and I should have felt as I was \u0027sponsible for you. But Mr. Julian is a man now, and when he says, \u0027I mean to go with you anyhow, Bill,\u0027 it was not for me to say, you sha\u0027n\u0027t go. Mr. Julian, he is a sort of gent that gets over one somehow, and there ain\u0027t no saying \u0027no\u0027 to him.\" \"Well, it is of no use talking about that now,\" Frank said impatiently. \"First tell me all about it, and then we will see what had best be done.\" \"Well, Master Frank, it was eight miles to the west. The chaps concerned in it thought they had managed to throw dust into the eyes of Captain Downes, and to get the Boxer away to Swanage, and how he got wind of the affair, and where it was to be, is more nor I can tell. Everything was going on smooth enough, and half the cargo was in the carts, when all of a sudden there was a shout \u0027Surrender, you scoundrels!\u0027 and that fellow Faulkner dashed up with a pistol in his hand, and behind him came a score of revenue men. I dodged under a cart and bolted. I heard some pistol shots fired, for just at that time a lot of the smugglers had come up to the carts with kegs. As if the firing on shore had been a signal, I heard directly after some guns down by the water, and knew that Downes and the Boxer had come on the lugger. I made straight back, but I could not sleep all night for wondering whether Mr. Julian had got off too, and I was up afore it was light, and went round to one or two of the other chaps as was there. One had not come back; the other had only been in half an hour. He had hid up, close to where we was surprised. \"After it was over the revenue chaps lit a lot of lanterns and then made a big fire, and by its light my mate could see pretty well what was going on. They had got about twenty prisoners. Most of the country people and carts had, luckily enough for them, gone off with their loads a few minutes afore the revenue men came up. A dozen pack-horses and three or four carts had been took, and, in course, all the loads the men were carrying up. Among those who was took was Mr. Julian. He was standing close to me when they came up, and I expect he was collared immediate. Faulkner, he sat down on a tub by the side of the fire and takes out a book, and the prisoners was brought up one by one and questions asked them. Mr. Julian was one of the last. Faulkner got up from his seat and rowed him tremendous. What he said my mate could not catch, but he could hear his voice, and he was going on at him cruel; then I suppose Mr. Julian lost his temper, and my mate says he could see that he was giving it him back hot. I expect it was something wonderful hard and nasty he said, for Faulkner jumped at him and hit him in the face. Then your brother threw himself on him. My mate says he would have thrown him backwards into the fire, if some of the revenue men had not seized him and dragged him off. \"After that there was a row between Faulkner and Captain Downes, who had come up just before with half a dozen sailors. I expect Downes was telling him that he ought to be ashamed of himself. Anyhow they got to high words, as was easy to be heard. Half an hour later most of them started with the prisoners, leaving half a dozen of the officers to look after the things they had taken. When they had gone, my mate went down close to the water, and was able to make out the cutter and the lugger anchored close together—so she has been caught. There was nothing else to wait for, so he tramped off home and had only been in a few minutes before I came to him.\" \"This is awful,\" Frank said, in dismay. \"The only thing I see that can be done is for me to go and have a talk with Captain Downes. He was a friend of my father\u0027s; and I think he is a kind-hearted man, though, of course, he has to be sharp in carrying out his duty of trying to put down smuggling. Well, I will run in for breakfast now, or my aunt will wonder what has become of me; then I will go straight on board the Boxer. \"She is not in yet,\" Bill said. \"She would not start until daylight; and I don\u0027t suppose she will be round for another two hours. You see she is not clear of Portland Bill yet.\" \"That is unfortunate. However, I hope I shall see him before the magistrates sit. What time do they meet?\" \"They generally sit at eleven o\u0027clock; but it ain\u0027t their day, and they will have to be summoned special. I should not wonder if they don\u0027t meet till two o\u0027clock; because they could not be sure what time the Boxer will get round, and, as he will have taken some prisoners in the lugger, they would not begin until he arrived.\" \"Very well; I will go round to the court-house after breakfast, and inquire what time the sitting will be. Anyhow, I hope to be able to see the lieutenant before they meet. I don\u0027t know that any good can come of it; for, as he had nothing to do with Julian\u0027s capture, he certainly would not be able to save him from appearing, especially after that row with Faulkner.\" \"He\u0027s a bad un that, Master Frank, and I wish your brother had chucked him into that fire. A bit of burning might have done him good; and, if ever a chap deserved it, he did.\" Frank went back into the house. \"My dear Frank,\" Mrs. Troutbeck exclaimed, \"where have you been? I have never known you keep breakfast waiting before. Why, what is the matter, dear? Nothing about Julian, I hope; hasn\u0027t he come home yet?\" \"No, Aunt; and I am sorry to say that he has got into an awkward scrape. It seems that he went out, for the fun of the thing, to see a cargo run. The revenue people came up, and he was one of those who were caught. Of course he had nothing to do with the smuggling part of the business, nor with a bit of a fight there was. Still, as he was there, I am afraid there is no doubt that he will have to appear before the magistrates with the others.\" Mrs. Troutbeck sat in speechless consternation. \"Oh, dear! oh, dear!\" she exclaimed at last. \"How could he have been so silly? It is dreadful, my dear, and it will be such a disgrace. What shall we do?\" \"There is nothing to do, Aunt, that I can see. As to the disgrace, that is nothing very dreadful. No end of people are mixed up in smuggling; and I have heard that many of the gentry wink at it, and are glad enough to buy a keg of brandy cheap without asking any questions where it comes from. So the mere fact that Julian went to have a look at a cargo being run is not anything very serious. I suppose it was against the law even to be present, but there was nothing disgraceful about it. It is lucky my holidays began last week, and if there is anything to be done I can do it.\" \"Could not Mr. Downes get him off? He used often to be here in your father\u0027s time, though I have not seen much of him since; but I am sure he would do anything he could.\" \"I have been thinking of that, Aunt. The Boxer was there last night and captured the smuggler, but her crew had nothing to do with the fight on shore; and, therefore, I don\u0027t think there is any chance of his being able to interfere in the matter. Still, I will see him as soon as the cutter comes in.\" On going down to the court-house, Frank found that the magistrates would meet at two o\u0027clock. Then, as the Boxer had only just appeared round Portland, he went and saw the chief officer of the coast-guard to endeavour to obtain permission to have an interview with Julian. \"I am sorry I can do nothing in the matter, lad,\" he replied. \"It is out of my hands, owing to a magistrate being present at the capture. It was, indeed, his business more than ours; for it was he who obtained information of the affair, and called upon us to aid him in the capture of men engaged in unlawful practices. Therefore, you see, the prisoners are in the hands of the civil authorities. I hear he has given strict orders that no one is, on any pretence, to speak to the prisoners.\" \"I hear that he struck my brother.\" \"I don\u0027t know how you heard it, lad, but it is true. However, I do not feel at liberty to say anything about it. I am very sorry for your brother, who is a fine young fellow. However, I hope that as he was unarmed, and was not, I suppose, actually concerned in the smuggling business, the matter will be passed over lightly, even if he is not discharged at once. At any rate, we shall in no way press the case against him.\" Frank, indeed, afterwards learned that the officer dropped a hint to the men to make as little as possible of Julian\u0027s capture, and of the vigorous resistance he had made when first seized. The Boxer dropped anchor off the town at twelve o\u0027clock, and the lieutenant landed at once. The officer of the coast-guard went down to meet him on the quay, and for half an hour they walked up and down the parade together, in earnest conversation. Frank remained on the opposite side of the road until they stopped, and the commander of the Boxer beckoned to him. \"Well, lad,\" he said, as Frank came up, \"this is a nasty scrape that your brother has got into; but I don\u0027t think they can do anything to him. Mr. Moorsby has been telling me that you have been to him; but neither he nor I can do anything in the matter—it is in the civil hands. If it had been anyone else but Faulkner who had been in charge, I have no doubt it could have been managed. Of course, your brother ought not to have been there, but as he was only looking on, and taking no active part in the affair, he might have been released without any difficulty. However, I don\u0027t think you need worry yourself. Certainly, we shall not press the case against him. It is unfortunate that he used his tongue as sharply as he did to Mr. Faulkner, though I don\u0027t say but that he had great provocation, or that what he said was not perfectly true; still, it would have been much better left unsaid. However, I question if before the hearing is over Faulkner will not have cause to regret that he did not let your brother go home as soon as they got back here.\" He nodded, and Frank understood that there was no more to say, and, thanking the officer, turned and walked off home. The fisherman met him on the way. \"You keep up your heart, Mr. Frank. Me and some of the others have been having a talk with the coast-guards, and they will be all right. Of course, there is not one of them that does not know Mr. Julian, so they won\u0027t say more than they can help against him; and every one of them is glad to hear that he gave it to that Faulkner hot. He ain\u0027t no more a favourite with them than he is with other people, and it was not by their own will that they ran in and pulled your brother off him. If they hadn\u0027t, he would not have been sitting on the bench to-day, nor for many a week, I reckon; for he would have been pretty badly burned if he had fallen across that fire. So you may be sure that they will make it easy for Mr. Julian, and I expect you will have him back home this evening. They would never have took him at all if they had known who he was; but, of course, being dark, and he in his fishing togs, they did not see it was him.\" Frank returned home in much better spirits than he had left. His aunt was standing at the window, and hurried to the door to let him in. \"Well, Frank, have you got him out? I hoped you would have brought him home with you.\" \"There was no chance of that, Aunt. Of course, when anyone is taken and locked up, he cannot be discharged until the case has been gone into. But I have seen Mr. Moorsby, the coast-guard officer on shore, and Captain Downes, and they both say that the case will not be pressed against him, and that, as he was not taking any part in the affair, and merely looking on, they don\u0027t think anything will be done to him. The coast-guardsmen who will have to give evidence all know him, and will not say anything against him if they can help it. So I should not be at all surprised, Aunt, if we have him back here this afternoon.\" \"Oh, I do wish,\" Mrs. Troutbeck said tearfully, \"that it could have been managed so that he would not have been obliged to be placed in the dock with smugglers and all sorts of people.\" \"It would, no doubt, have been better if it could have been avoided, Aunt, but there is no helping it; and if he is discharged it won\u0027t go for much against him—certainly not here, where nobody regards smuggling as a crime.\" At half-past one Frank went down to the court-house. It was already crowded, but Captain Downes, who came up at the same moment, took him in, and obtained a place for him at the solicitors\u0027 table. The seizure had created quite a sensation in Weymouth, not only because two or three Weymouth men were among the prisoners, but because, owing to the fight that had taken place, the matter was very much more serious than a mere capture of contraband goods. There was a general buzz of conversation until three magistrates came in and took their places, and there was a little murmur of satisfaction as Colonel Chambers, the chairman, took his seat; for, had he not been present, Mr. Faulkner, who was next in seniority, would have taken the chair. A minute later, twelve prisoners were brought in. Five Frenchmen and two Englishmen were a portion of the crew of the smuggler; two were farmers\u0027 men, the drivers of the carts; one was a local fisherman; the eleventh was one of the party that had gone from Weymouth; Julian Wyatt made up the number. Two or three of the party had their heads bandaged up; one had his arm in a sling; several others had marks of hard knocks, and Julian a pair of black eyes. When the little murmur that followed the entry of the prisoners had subsided, and the crier had called out \"Silence in court,\" the inquiry began. Mr. Moorsby was the first witness. He deposed that having received information that a landing of contraband goods was likely to take place, he, accompanied by Mr. Faulkner, who represented the civil authorities, went to the spot. They perceived that a landing of goods was taking place; but, as it had been arranged that his party should not show themselves until the revenue cutter came up and seized the lugger, they remained in hiding until they heard from a man placed down by the shore that the cutter was coming in. Then they rushed out and seized the parties engaged in the proceedings. Some of them resisted violently, and a serious fray took place. Three of his men were wounded with pistol shots, one of them very seriously. One of the smugglers had been killed, and three were so seriously injured that they could not at present be placed in the dock. \"Are any of the prisoners represented in court?\" the chairman asked. A solicitor sitting next to Frank rose. \"I represent Mr. Julian Wyatt,\" he said. Frank looked up at him in surprise. The idea of obtaining legal assistance for Julian had not occurred to him, and he wondered how his brother had been able to communicate with a solicitor. \"I would suggest, your honour,\" the latter went on, \"that the evidence should be taken separately in the different charges, as there is a considerable difference in the position of prisoners.\" Another solicitor rose. \"I appear for John Turnbull and William Sims,\" he said, \"and I would support the appeal of Mr. Probert. My clients, who are farming men, took no part whatever in the fray, which is the serious portion of the affair. While I am ready to admit that they were engaged in the illegal operation of aiding in the landing of contraband goods, I shall be able to prove that they are innocent of the more serious charge of resisting by force their capture by the revenue officers, and with using deadly weapons against the representatives of the law, and that their case stands in an altogether different category to that of the main body of the prisoners.\" \"You do not intend, I hope,\" Mr. Faulkner said, \"to express a wish that we should have what would practically be twelve investigations instead of one, or that the witnesses should all be obliged to go that number of times into the box.\" \"By no means, your honour; I am only intimating my intention of cross-examining each witness as to the share my clients took in the affair, and pointing out beforehand that their case stands on an entirely different footing to that of the men who took part in the more serious charge of resisting the officers.\" One after another of the coast-guard men gave their evidence, each identifying one or more of the prisoners in whose capture they had taken a personal part. None of the first five had anything to say regarding Julian. Then James Wingfield entered the box. After stating that he was the coxswain of the Weymouth coast-guard boat he proceeded: \"When Mr. Moorsby gave the order I ran forward. I saw a biggish man standing with his hands in the pockets of his pea-jacket. He seemed to be looking on, and was not at work; but, thinking that he might be a leader, me and Harry Wilkens ran at him and seized him. It was not until afterwards we knew that he was Mr. Julian Wyatt. After we had caught him I handed him over to Wilkens, and that is all I know about him.\" He then proceeded to testify against several of the other prisoners in whose capture he had taken part. When he had finished his evidence, Julian\u0027s solicitor rose. \"You say that the prisoner you first took, Mr. Wyatt, was taking no active part in the affair?\" \"No, sir, he was just standing there looking on.\" \"And did he resist the capture?\" \"Not to say resist, sir. When we first clapped hands on him he gave a start, for we had come upon him sudden, without noise. He just tried to shake us off, not knowing, I reckon, who we were; but as soon as I said, \u0027In the King\u0027s name, you are my prisoner,\u0027 he was just as quiet as a lamb.\" The solicitor sat down. Then the chairman asked the witness if any arms were found on the prisoner. \"No, sir.\" \"Not even a stick?\" \"I won\u0027t say as he may not have had a bit of a stick, your honour, though I did not notice it, his hands being in his pockets; anyhow, he did not try to use it.\" Wilkens was the next witness, and his evidence, as far as Julian was concerned, was precisely similar to that of the coxswain. Against the seven men of the lugger the evidence was conclusive. All had resisted desperately, and this had enabled several of their party to make their escape in the darkness. The Weymouth fisherman had been caught coming up from the beach with a keg on his shoulder, and had thrown it down and attempted to run away, but had made no resistance when he had been taken; the two farm men had been captured at their horses\u0027 heads, and had at once surrendered. When the evidence had been gone through, Mr. Probert addressed the court on behalf of Julian. He urged that there was no evidence whatever to show that he was concerned either in the smuggling operations or in the resistance to the revenue officers. \"I do not pretend,\" he said, \"that he was there by accident; but I maintain that he was there simply in the capacity of a looker-on. He stands, in fact, precisely in the same position that any member of the general public might do, who had been present as a spectator at any sort of riot. It is unquestionably a very unwise action on the part of any individual to attend a meeting of any sort at which it is possible that riotous proceedings may take place, but I maintain that, however imprudent and foolish, there is nothing criminal in his doing so, and I am sure that there is no case on record in which a man has been punished for his presence at a riot in which he did not participate. My client acted foolishly, but I ask the court to say that his foolishness was not criminal. He had accidentally learned that there was to be a landing of contraband goods, and, with the thoughtlessness of youth, he went to see what he considered the fun. Even if there had been a shadow of criminality in his being present, I should ask you to say that the unpleasant experience that he has undergone—his detention for twelve hours in a police cell, and his appearance here—is ample punishment for his boyish escapade, which might have been committed by any high-spirited young fellow of nineteen.\" After the other solicitor had addressed the court on behalf of the two farmers\u0027 men, the magistrates consulted together. The spectators, watching them attentively, saw that for a time they seemed unanimous, then it was equally evident that there was a difference of opinion on some point or other, and they presently rose and left the court. \"It is Faulkner against the other two,\" Mr. Probert whispered to Frank. \"Of course they were unanimous about the smugglers, but I expect they differed as to the others. It is lucky that the Colonel is in the chair. Harrington is a mild little fellow, and Faulkner would be able to twist him round his finger if there were only the two of them, but there is no fear of that with the Colonel there to keep him straight.\" In ten minutes they returned, and by the flushed, angry face of Mr. Faulkner, Frank judged at once that he had been overruled. The chairman briefly announced the decision of the court, and committed the seven smugglers for trial on the whole of the charges. The Weymouth fisherman was also committed, but only on the charge of being engaged in the unlawful act of defrauding His Majesty\u0027s revenue, and was allowed out on bail. The two farm labourers were fined fifty pounds apiece, which their solicitor at once paid. \"The majority of the bench are in favour of your immediate discharge, Mr. Wyatt, being of opinion that the evidence has failed altogether to prove any of the charges against you, and, being of opinion that you have already paid dearly enough for your reckless folly in attending an unlawful operation of this kind, they trust that it will be a lesson to you for life. The other and more serious charge against you will now be taken.\" Frank, who was in the act of rising from his seat in delight at Julian\u0027s acquittal, sank down again in dismay at the concluding words. He had no idea of any further charge. \"What is it?\" he whispered to Mr. Probert. \"Faulkner has charged him with an attempt to murder him. Have you not heard of it? Don\u0027t be frightened. I have seen the witnesses, and have no doubt that this case will break down like the other.\" After all the prisoners but Julian had been removed from the dock, Mr. Faulkner left the bench and took his seat in the body of the court. The charge was then read over by the clerk, and Mr. Faulkner\u0027s name was called; as he stepped into the witness-box, a low hiss ran through the fishermen who formed a large proportion of the spectators. \"Silence!\" the chairman said angrily. \"If I hear any repetition of this indecent demonstration, I will have the court cleared at once.\" Mr. Faulkner then proceeded to give his evidence. \"He had,\" he said, \"spoken severely to the prisoner in his quality as a magistrate, upon his taking part in smuggling transactions. At this the prisoner became violently abusive and uttered such murderous threats that he thought he would have struck him, and in self-defence he (the witness) gave him a blow, whereupon the prisoner had sprung upon him like a tiger, had lifted him in his arms, and had carried him bodily towards the fire, and would assuredly have thrown him into it had he not been prevented from doing so by some of the coast-guardsmen.\" Mr. Probert rose quietly. \"You are a magistrate, Mr. Faulkner, I believe?\" Mr. Faulkner gave no reply to the question, and after a little pause the solicitor went on: \"Do you consider that, as a magistrate, Mr. Faulkner, it comes within your province to abuse a prisoner unconvicted of any crime?\" \"I deny that I abused him,\" Mr. Faulkner said hotly. \"There is no occasion for heat, sir,\" Mr. Probert said quietly. \"You are in the position of a witness at present and not of a magistrate, and must reply like any other witness. Well, you deny having abused him. Do you consider that calling a gentleman of good standing in this town, the son of a distinguished officer, a loafing young scoundrel, not abuse; or by telling him that six months in one of His Majesty\u0027s jails would do him a world of good?\" \"I deny that I used those words.\" \"Well, sir, that is a question of pure credibility. It is possible that I may be in a position to prove to the satisfaction of the bench that you did use them, and many others of an equally offensive character. Mr. Wyatt naturally resented such language, which you had no more right to address to him than you would have to address to me. If a magistrate forgets his position, and abuses a prisoner in the language of a fish-fag, he must expect to be answered in the same way by anyone of spirit. You say that, thereupon, he became abusive and used murderous threats? Now we should like to hear a little more about this. First of all, let us hear the abuse, will you? Tell the court, if you please, Mr. Faulkner, what were the abusive expressions,\" he added. \"He said, sir, that I was a disgrace to the bench.\" There was a general laugh in the court, which was instantly repressed. Mr. Faulkner\u0027s eyes ran furiously over the crowded benches. \"I must ask you to look at me, Mr. Faulkner,\" the solicitor said mildly. \"Well, he said that you were a disgrace to the bench. That is scarcely, perhaps, as much a matter of abuse as one of private opinion. What did he say next?\" \"He said I was a curse to the whole neighbourhood.\" \"Again a mere matter of opinion.\" \"And after that that I was a sneaking, meddlesome, interfering old fox.\" There was again a buzz of laughter, mingled with exclamations of \"So you are,\" \"He wasn\u0027t far wrong;\" upon which Colonel Chalmers directed the constable to turn all the offending parties out of court. Some fishermen nearest to the door were hustled out. \"Well, I am afraid that I must admit,\" Mr. Probert said, \"that to call you a meddlesome old fox was abusive, although nothing like so abusive as to call a man a loafing young scoundrel. Now as to the threats.\" \"He said that I would be brought home one of these days with a bullet in my body.\" \"That is purely a matter of prophecy, Mr. Faulkner, and not a threat, unless he intended you to understand that it was he who would fire the bullet. Do you mean to tell the court that you had any reason to suppose that this young gentleman, whose reputation is untarnished, and who has never had a charge brought against him except the ridiculous one that has just been dismissed, intended to imply by those words that he himself had any idea of taking your life?\" \"It might bear that construction.\" \"It might bear any construction in the mind of a man determined to see everything in the worst possible light. It is a matter of public notoriety, Mr. Faulkner, that you have received several threatening letters, and that the active part you have taken against poachers and smugglers has caused some feeling against you. Do you not think it likely that when Mr. Wyatt used the words you have repeated he referred to this circumstance?\" \"A magistrate who does his duty must necessarily be unpopular with the criminal classes.\" \"Possibly, Mr. Faulkner, though I have known many magistrates who did their duty and who were by no means unpopular; but you have not answered my question. Do you not think that in saying what he did Mr. Wyatt simply alluded to the fact of your well-known unpopularity, and to the threatening letters that you have received?\" \"Possibly he did,\" Mr. Faulkner admitted reluctantly, \"although that was not my impression at the time.\" \"Well, then, unless there were further threats, as you call them, I think we have disposed of the alleged abuse and the alleged murderous threats. Now we come to the other charge. You thought that he was about to strike you, and in self-defence gave him a blow. What made you think that he was going to strike you?\" \"He made a step towards me with a threatening gesture.\" \"Oh, I dare say that he was angry, but a gentleman who has been called a loafing young scoundrel is somewhat apt to lose his temper. You might even do so yourself, Mr. Faulkner, if so addressed. Well, then, he made a step towards you; thereupon you struck him in the face, and judging from his appearance you struck him pretty hard, and then you say he caught you up and carried you along. It says a good deal for his strength that he was able to do so. Now you say he carried you towards the fire, and would have thrown you upon it had not some of the coast-guardsmen interfered in time. Now, how do you know that that was his intention?\" \"I firmly believe that it was so.\" \"It is not a question of belief. You might believe that he was going to throw you up to the moon. You struggled, I suppose—you would scarcely submit to be carried like a baby—I imagine that is about the long and short of it. But even if he had intended to throw you on the fire, which certainly seems to be merely a matter of your imagination, you can hardly pretend that had he carried out this intention that it would have been murder. Surely with a score of your friends standing by, you would have been hauled out immediately, none the worse except for a few singes and a burn or two. This was not a burning fiery furnace, Mr. Faulkner, but merely a bit of a bonfire from a few sticks that had been set on fire in order to throw a little light on the proceedings.\" \"I might have been very seriously burnt.\" \"Well, even supposing that you had been, that is not a question of murder. I presume that you framed this indictment you have charged the prisoner, not with an intention of committing grievous damage upon you, but with murder, and if you now admit that, under the circumstances, death could hardly have resulted by any possibility from this imaginary intention of throwing you on the fire being carried out, it is clear that the charge of murder must drop through.
