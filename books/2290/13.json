{"id":92254,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Leaving Maggie, Jessica moved as quickly as possible. Darkness was coming far too quickly. Despite Maggie\u0027s assurances, she felt she had to personally check on the situation at the hospital. She went to David\u0027s room and saw that there was indeed a cop on duty. Yeah, well, there had been a cop on duty with Mary, too. Discreetly, pretending she was looking for another room, she tried to get a good look at the officer. She should have faith in Sean, of course, but... The officer was huge, a big, handsome man of mixed heritage. She saw the chain around his neck. It held a crucifix, she was certain. She tarried until she heard the officer speaking to a nurse leaving the room. \"How\u0027s he doing?\" \"Good, good. He\u0027s talking. Doesn\u0027t remember a thing, though.\" She lowered her voice to a near whisper. \"Spooky, if you ask me. I tell you, we never lost a patient here before. I mean a dead patient. You know. We\u0027ve never lost a corpse from the morgue.\" \"College kids. Pranks,\" the cop said, his voice reassuring. \"I don\u0027t know. I just get the willies around here these days.\" she said, and then she smiled, gave a little wave and started down the hall. Jessica left the hospital and went on to her office, hoping to find Jeremy and Nancy there. No luck. Looking around, she had a strange feeling, as if someone had been there, as if they\u0027d just left. She told herself that she\u0027d let the kids use the office, and that was all it was. Still, a sense of unease plagued her. Something unnerving had happened here. She paused, looking around, then closing her eyes. Had the Master been here? No. It was a different sense of...violation that plagued her. But she didn\u0027t have time to dwell on it. She started out, then nearly screamed aloud when she ran straight into Big Jim. He immediately looked sheepish. \"Sorry. Didn\u0027t mean to scare you.\" \"My fault. But what the heck are you doing here? I can\u0027t imagine you\u0027ve come for my services.\" He shook his head. \"I read the newspaper,\" he said softly. \"And I\u0027m worried.\" \"I\u0027m okay.\" \"You\u0027ve got to be careful. I can feel it in my old bones when things are going wrong. You know me. And you know I can feel it when the, er, otherworldly is going down. Comes from all the voodoo in my life, I suppose.\" \"Your bones aren\u0027t all that old, Jim.\" \"I don\u0027t like this. I don\u0027t like this one bit. And too many good folks are still out of town.\" \"I know. I think Maggie is going to make some calls.\" \"I saw the sky turn red. This evil is after you.\" Jessica looked around quickly. \"You\u0027re alone, right?\" \"Yeah, I\u0027m alone. Barry Larson is a good old boy, but don\u0027t worry, we never do anything but tease about my old voodoo-queen granny.\" \"Big Jim, you need to be careful. The whole city needs to be careful. If I had my way, I\u0027d ask Sean to impose a curfew.\" \"And he\u0027d be locked up in an insane asylum.\" \"I know. That\u0027s all that stops me.\" \"You call me when you need me.\" \"You be careful. You could be in danger, too.\" He gave her a huge smile. \"Not me. I know what I\u0027m up against.\" \"No. No one really understands what they\u0027re up against.\" \"When you need me, I\u0027m here.\" \"I know.\" She gave him a fierce hug. \"Thank you.\" He stepped back, studying her. \"You know what I think? I think there\u0027s got to be someone close to you who isn\u0027t what he seems.\" She froze, frowning, and asked sharply, \"What do you mean?\" \"Ifhe\u0027s here, he\u0027s got help.\" \"You mean...the Master?\" \"Honey, think about it. He must have someone working for him, right here.\" She exhaled softly, staring at him.He was right . Even so, she shook her head in denial. \"The only people who were in Romania were the kids and Bryan MacAllistair. But it can\u0027t be him. He\u0027s hunting the Master himself. He wants to destroy him.\" \"Yeah? How do you know that? Only because he says so, right? And think about it. Where is he staying? Your place.\" \"No. I can\u0027t believe...\" \"Watch your back. He doesn\u0027t need an invitation to come in.\" \"Look, it could be anyone. The Master didn\u0027t need any help in Transylvania.\" She didn\u0027t allow her voice to falter. Big Jim wouldn\u0027t be swayed. \"There\u0027s someone, and it\u0027s someone close to you,\" he warned. \"I\u0027ve get to get moving,\" she said, putting an end to the uncomfortable topic. \"You listen to what people are saying in the bar, okay?\" \"You know it,\" he promised. Her cell started to ring. She answered it, still meeting his grave stare. \"Hello?\" \"Jessica, its Maggie. Get over here. Now.\" \"But I haven\u0027t found-\" \"I think you should come. Seriously. There\u0027s still time before dark.\" Jessica nodded and hung up. \"Big Jim, if you see those kids, tell them to go to my place. To Montresse House. Okay?\" Maggie was at the door when she parked in the drive. Jessica frowned. \"What\u0027s going on?\" \"Ancient texts,\" Maggie told her. \"You got ancient texts off the computer?\" Jessica asked incredulously. \"With patience, you can find anything you want on the computer,\" Maggie assured her. \"Come in. Sit down.\" They returned to the kitchen. There were papers from Maggie\u0027s printer spread out all over the breakfast table. \"Here, this one is Babylonian. The translation is, \u0027He rises when the time is right, when the succubi ride rampant over the land. Neither god nor man nor beast, he rises to wage war against the miasma that reigns.\u0027\" \"Ancient Babylonian?\" Jessica murmured doubtfully. \"Yes. And this is a release from the Vatican, twelfth century.\" \"This is in Latin,\" Jessica said. \"Translation to the left,\" Maggie warned. \"\u0027As there shall be demons, so there shall be angels. And as the war within the world is not the war within the soul, there are those whose demonic strength shall cast terror into the innocents. Yet so there shall be warriors, those granted life and breath, to do battle. Therefore, have ye faith, have ye strength, have ye courage. Ever and eternally, such a battle will rage, for if there is darkness, there is light, if there is love, there is hatred. So shall they rise, by the strength and goodness of His love and mercy, those who were warriors, and where there is despair, they will bring hope. Thus may they fight the eternal battle.\u0027\" Jessica set down the printed sheet, staring at Maggie. \"How did you find this?\" \"I\u0027ve been at it since you\u0027ve left. I\u0027ve found a dozen other references to these beings known as warriors. I had heard about them before. I remember a time in Europe when there was a great fear of them. I never came across any such beings, but...I should have remembered. Come on, think about it-you must have heard something, too.\" \"Now that you mention it, I had heard of them, but...that was a long time ago. I thought that they were men sent out by the Church in a time when people believed that an old woman with healing powers was a witch, a bride of Satan-that people signed away their souls to the devil and danced naked in the moonlight. So...you think Bryan MacAllistair is one of them?\" Jessica asked. \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s just any warrior,\" Maggie said softly. \"I think he is-or was-the champion who fought for Robert Bruce. The great warrior who strode onto the field at Hay Glen and allowed the fledgling king to escape when Edward III first took the throne and decided to battle the Scots.\" Jessica sank into a chair and stared at Maggie. \"That\u0027s not possible.\" \"It is.\" \"He\u0027d be more than a thousand years old.\" \"I didn\u0027t find a life span noted in any of the references to the warriors,\" Maggie said. \"It\u0027s impossible,\" Jessica repeated. \"Why?\" \"He died. I\u0027ve studied history. He died.\" \"Things aren\u0027t always what they seem,\" Maggie said grimly. \"You need to go back to your house and stay there.\" \"I can\u0027t, and you know it. Thank you, Maggie. I don\u0027t believe what you\u0027re telling me, but I promise to be careful.\" \"Just keep your distance from him.\" \"He\u0027s living in my house.\" \"Perhaps you should ask him to leave.\" Jessica couldn\u0027t help the guilty look that came over her face, followed by a hot blush. \"Oh, no,\" Maggie groaned. \"You\u0027re not going to ask him to leave. You\u0027resleeping with him.\" \"Yes,\" Jessica answered at last. \"And yes, there\u0027s something about him, but...\" Unable to put her feelings into words, she let her voice trail off. \"Just be careful. That\u0027s all I ask.\" Jessica gave her friend a hug and headed for the door. Then she turned around. \"I saw Big Jim. He thinks the Master has help here. Someone close to me.\" \"Who?\" \"Someone who might have been in Romania, as well.\" \"The kids?\" Maggie said dubiously. \"No, Bryan MacAllistair. Your warrior.\" \"I still say I\u0027m right,\" Maggie said. \"There was someone else there. Someone who got there before me and went up against the Master. That was when panic set in. I had to wait before I could make my move. His power over his followers is so great that if he\u0027s threatened, they\u0027d die like lemmings tossing themselves into the sea in their single-minded willingness to protect him. He has to be taken by surprise. I had to see how the stage was set before I did anything, but before I could, the battle began. But the Master knew I was there, and...he\u0027ll be out to kill me.\" \"My point, exactly,\" Maggie said. \"You need to keep the hell away from him.\" Jessica nodded. \"No, I need to make sure that I\u0027m ahead of the game this time. But it\u0027s happening fast. The time is right...I canfeel it.\" \"Maybe you should back out-let MacAllistair face the battle. That\u0027s the whole point of his existence.\" \"I can\u0027t. From the beginning, this has been my battle.\" \"Let it go,\" Maggie begged. \"But you won\u0027t, will you?\" she asked, meeting Jessica\u0027s determined gaze. At the door, Jessica gave her friend another fierce hug. When she stepped outside, her unease grew. Dusk had not yet come, and yet, even by day, the sky was turning colors, streaks of red curling across it. She held very still, afraid. Something was happening. Tonight. To his own astonishment, Bryan was able to find Jeremy and Nancy. They were just a block down Bourbon Street, sipping green drinks in glasses that lit up and listening to a mellow rock group. He slid into the booth next to Jeremy. \"Hey, Prof,\" Jeremy said dully. \"Hey,\" Nancy said, forcing a note of cheerfulness into her voice. \"You two doing okay?\" \"Yeah, great,\" Jeremy said morosely. \"My best friend is dead, and you all think she\u0027s a vampire who wants to kill me, so you want to stake her. Her mom has been calling me, and I haven\u0027t got the guts to call her back. On top of that, I\u0027m thinking I\u0027m going to have to spend the rest of my life hiding. I\u0027m afraid, and I want to see her. And if I said this to anyone else, I\u0027d be committed.\" \"I think you captured the situation fairly accurately in the first few sentences,\" Bryan said flatly. \"Meanwhile, it\u0027s getting late.\" \"Yeah, right, late,\" Jeremy murmured. \"I\u0027m going to take you to Montresse House. Now,\" Bryan said firmly. \"Jessica has us all set up at her office,\" Nancy reminded him. Bryan shook his head. \"Montresse House will be safer,\" he assured her. \"You\u0027ll have more company.\" \"Like hell.\" Jeremy turned accusing eyes on him. \"You\u0027re hoping Mary will come, and then you can kill her.\" Nancy put a hand on his. \"Jeremy, Mary is already dead.\" \"But she looks the same. And when she calls to me...\" \"She\u0027s hungry, nothing more,\" Bryan told him and rose. \"Now let\u0027s go,\" he said curtly. Montresse House was beautiful, and there was certainly plenty of room. Stacey, who apparently ran the inn, along with whatever else she could get away with, was nice, if bossy, Jeremy decided. The handyman, Gareth, wasn\u0027t bossy, just quiet and a little bit creepy. You didn\u0027t know he was there, he was so silent, and then you\u0027d get an eerie feeling down your spine, turn around and see him standing there. But the house did seem safe, and it was good to be around Stacey, because she seemed calm and relaxed, as if nothing could scare her. When she showed Jeremy to his room, he asked her, \"You believe in all this, then? I mean, I haven\u0027t missed a big news story or something, have I? This is crazy, right?\" Stacey smiled. \"Most of the time, there\u0027s an order to things in life, a balance, but sometimes, that balance gets shifted a bit.\" \"So you believe in vampires?\" he persisted. \"Yes.\" \"But...how?\" \"There are different planes of existence. Mostly, they all co-exist. Sometimes the world we know and what we call the netherworld collide. How\u0027s that?\" \"It\u0027s more bullshit.\" \"It\u0027s all I\u0027m going to give you,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll check on Nancy. You make yourself comfortable, okay?\" \"Where\u0027s Jessica?\" he asked. \"If I could just see Jessica...\" \"I\u0027m not sure,\" Stacey said. \"But I know she wants you here. And I know she wants you to be careful.\" \"I have to tell her about Mary. That Mary can\u0027t be evil.\" Stacey took his hand. \"What Mary is now...she was created by evil. You have to accept that. I\u0027ll be back in a little while. You shouldn\u0027t be alone. Settle in. Then we\u0027ll all be together, all right?\" She left him. He walked over to the French doors that led to the wraparound balcony. The drapes were open and he drew them shut. There were fresh vines and flowers draped around the windows and the doors-and they all had garlic artfully entwined in them. He fingered the cross around his neck, then held it very tightly. And remembered the way Mary had torn the cross she wore from around hers. Stacey walked down the hall, hesitating outside Jessica\u0027s room. She tapped; Jessica didn\u0027t answer. She hadn\u0027t expected she would. She moved on and tried Bryan MacAllistair\u0027s door. He should have been there, having just come in with Jeremy and Nancy. \"Bryan?\" Still no answer. His door was locked. She had a passkey, and even though she knew she shouldn\u0027t, she opened his door. The room was empty. Frowning, she shut and relocked the door, then hurried downstairs. \"Bryan? Professor MacAllistair?\" There was no reply. Swearing, she went to the front and looked outside. She could see no one. She went to the back, running across to Gareth\u0027s cottage. She banged on his door. \"Gareth!\" He didn\u0027t answer, either, which concerned her even more than Bryan\u0027s absence. Her cell phone rang. She dug it from her pocket. \"Stacey, it\u0027s Jessica.\" \"Jessica! Thank God. I think you should get back here right now.\" \"I can\u0027t. But you\u0027ve got to make sure Bryan MacAllistair stays there.\" \"Jessica, the kids are here, he brought them. But I can\u0027t find him.\" And even if I did, I couldn\u0027t keep him here, anyway, she thought. On the other end of the line, Jessica swore softly. \"If you see him again, tell him you think he\u0027s needed there, that you\u0027re sure Mary is nearby. Tell him...I don\u0027t know. If you see him again, just convince him that he\u0027s got to stay there.\" \"I\u0027ll do my best. Jessica...\" \"What?\" \"Mary really will come, won\u0027t she?\" Jessica lowered her head, knowing the truth. \"Yes, Mary really will come.\" \"Jeremy...\" Jeremy had been doing nothing but sitting dully in a chair in his room, staring into space, since Stacey had left him. \"Jeremy...\" He groaned. \"I\u0027m not hearing this,\" he said aloud. But he was hearing it. Mary\u0027s voice came again. \"Please!\" He knew he shouldn\u0027t do it. He rose, anyway. Her voice was coming from the window. He walked to it and drew back the heavy drapes. And she was there. She was no longer naked, but that didn\u0027t help any. She had found a beautiful white dress. Almost like a wedding dress. It bared her arms, and emphasized the perfection of her breasts, the slimness of her waist. She didn\u0027t look evil. She looked...angelic, floating outside the window, elegant in drifting, filmy white. He tried to tell himself that he had seen this scene before in a thousand movies, the seductive beauty staring hungrily at... A meal. \"Oh, Mary,\" he said miserably. \"Jeremy, I\u0027m so scared.\" \"You\u0027re dead, Mary,\" he forced himself to say dully. \"No, I\u0027m here, and I need your help. Please, Jeremy. I won\u0027t hurt you, I swear. I\u0027m just afraid. I can\u0027t go, Jeremy. If I go, I\u0027ll die. You have to let me in, keep me with you, keep me safe.\" She was a vampire, he told himself. She had always used him, and now she wanted to do it again, only this time she wanted his blood. She wanted his life. \"Jeremy?\" She said his name, then nothing more. Could vampires cry? Evidently. Huge tears appeared in her eyes, trailed down the pale contours of her still beautiful face. \"Don\u0027t cry, Mary.\" \"I\u0027m so afraid. I\u0027m being called...I\u0027ve been ordered.... Help me, Jeremy. Keep me with you. Keep me here, with you.\" He didn\u0027t know if her whisper created his insanity or if he actually believed her, but he opened the French doors. He reached out, and she joined him on the balcony. She should have felt cold, he thought, but she didn\u0027t. He took her tightly into his arms. She hugged him in return, then leaned against him and kissed his lips. She was shaking. He felt the pressure of her lips against his throat. Felt them quivering. His heart slammed. This was it. He had never been able to resist her. And now he was going to die for it.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kiss-of-darkness-alliance-vampires-7/page-13.html","bookId":2290,"book":{"id":2290,"title":"Kiss of Darkness (Alliance Vampires #7)","description":"Storyline: Kiss Of Darkness (Alliance Vampires #7) The woods have always been full of whispers in Transylvania, of terrors that go back centuries to the legendary Vlad Dracul himself.
