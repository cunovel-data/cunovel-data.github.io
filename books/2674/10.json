Ms. Patsy shouted to her to wait, hung up the phone, and rang up the sale. Resentment simmered in her sour expression as she handed the package to Regan, and without a word, walked away. Regan was astonished by the woman’s rudeness. She was actually relieved to get back to the hotel and her office, but the day didn’t get better. She spent the rest of the afternoon putting out one fire after another. She worked until six, then ran up to her suite to freshen up, and was back downstairs by the door waiting for Cordie by six-fifteen. Her friend arrived by cab, which meant the old Ford was on the fritz again. Regan called for her car before going outside to greet her friend. “What is it this time? The radiator?” “Muffler,” Cordie called out as she crossed the pavement. “I’ll buy a new one tomorrow and install it this weekend.” When Regan’s car was brought around, the doorman rushed to hold the door open. “I know what you’re thinking, Terry,” Regan said as she slid behind the wheel of her fifteen-year-old Chevy. The doorman grinned. “You really should think about trading it in.” “Are you kidding? It’s in mint condition.” Cordie had leaned across the bench to offer her comment. Sophie wasn’t waiting out in front of her apartment building when they pulled up. They had to circle the block three times before she appeared. Regan had been telling Cordie about the rest of her horrid day and how she was losing faith in her fellow man, but once Sophie got in the car, Regan didn’t get in another word on the drive to Liam House, ten miles away. The parking lot adjacent to the conference center was full, so Regan circled the park, looking for a space. The dim lighting made it difficult for her to see. Sophie was directing from the backseat. “There’s one … no that’s a driveway. Never mind. Keep going.” “Look at that idiot jogging down the middle of the street. Is he trying to get killed?” Cordie said. “I’ve got to start running again,” Sophie said. “I’ll run with you, Regan, on the university path.” “I don’t go there anymore,” Regan said. “Not since the indoor track was finished at the hotel. It’s much more convenient.” “I’d work out more often if I had a gym in my house,” Cordie said. “When have you ever worked out?” Sophie asked. “I work out,” Cordie countered. “I just don’t do it consistently.” Sophie laughed. “If you’d only get into shape, you wouldn’t have to diet all the—” Cordie cut her off. “You were going to tell us your big plan.” “What?” Cordie patiently repeated the reminder. “Oh, my God,” Sophie said. “I forgot.” Regan looked at her in the mirror. “You forgot your big plan?” “No, I forgot to tell you what happened today. You’re not going to believe it.” “So tell us,” Cordie demanded. “Mary Coolidge’s neighbor finally called me back. I’ve left at least ten messages for the man over the past couple of weeks and was about to give up, but as it turned out, he was out of town, and that’s why he didn’t call.” “And?” Cordie prodded. “You know that Shields always has two assistants flanking his sides?” “Yes,” Regan said. “Mary wrote about them in her journal.” “They’re really his goons.” “Goons? Who says ‘goons’ these days?” Cordie asked with a laugh. “Mary’s neighbor,” Sophie said. “He called them goons. Now, pay attention. Mary told her daughter that Shields said he’d hired the two men as bodyguards. She was afraid of them and said they seemed to enjoy intimidating people. They even went so far as to wear sunglasses day and night.” “That’s ridiculous,” Regan said. She spotted a car backing out of a parking space, put her blinker on, and pulled in. “So what did the neighbor say?” Cordie asked. She was getting a crick in her neck looking at Sophie. “He was letting his cat in when he saw two men walking up Mary’s drive.” Regan turned the motor off. “And you think they went to her house to threaten her?” Sophie nodded. “This is all speculation, but …” “But what?” Regan asked. “But I think she told Shields she was going to the police, and he sent his goons to dissuade her.” “I guess that’s possible,” Cordie said. “But it’s going to be tough to prove.” “Does the neighbor remember when the men were there?” Regan asked. “He’s pretty sure they were there the night Mary killed herself. I think they went there to terrorize her, and she thought that taking the pills was the only way out. Either that or …” “Jeez, Sophie, quit making us guess,” Cordie said. “Or what?” In a near whisper, Sophie said, “Maybe they forced her to take those pills, and they stayed there until she was unconscious.” Regan shook her head. “Think about it, Sophie. What was the last entry in her journal?” Cordie answered. “Too late. They’re coming.” “And the handwriting was pretty loopy, wasn’t it?” “It was all over the page,” Cordie said, “suggesting that Mary had already ingested pills.” “Unless they forced her to take some pills, then let her have a break so she could jot down a few thoughts in her journal, and then forced her to take more, I’d have to say …” “Okay, that theory doesn’t hold up,” Sophie said. “But if Shields’s men went there to threaten her …” “That would be very difficult to prove,” Regan said. “If we got a photo of the bodyguards and showed it to this neighbor …” Cordie began. Sophie slapped the headrest behind Cordie. “That’s exactly what I was thinking. Only, the thing is …” “Yes?” Regan asked. “The neighbor isn’t so sure he could recognize them,” she said. “He told me he didn’t get a real good look at their faces, but I still want to show him a photo just in case.” “So that’s it? That’s the big plan? Get a photo of the goons?” Cordie asked. “We could just drive up to the circle drive, sit in the car, and when they come out, snap, snap. We’ve got our photos.” “No, there’s more,” Sophie said. “First, we go in and I pay our fees.” “You’re not paying for me,” Regan said. “You’re not paying my fee either,” Cordie said. “You’re doing me a huge favor. You’re giving up your weekend to help, so no more argument. Paying the fees is the least I can do as a thank-you. I’m going to pay in cash,” she added in an attempt to deflect further argument. “I don’t want Shields or his people to have access to any accounts, so I don’t want to pay by check or credit card.” “Good Lord. Are you telling me you’re carrying three thousand dollars in your purse?” Sophie grinned. “There wasn’t room in my bra, so, yes, it’s in my purse.” “Who carries that kind of cash around?” Cordie asked Regan. “Apparently Sophie does,” she answered. “My father carries ten times that amount in cash all the time,” Sophie commented. “Soph, how can you afford to pay three thousand dollars?” Cor die asked. “You make less than I do.” “Daddy.” “You told me last month you weren’t ever going to take any more money from him, remember? You were determined to make it on your own.” “It was an early birthday present,” Sophie said. “He just purchased another vacation home, and for tax purposes put that one in my name too. Daddy has enough money stashed away to last three lifetimes.” Although they had known Sophie since kindergarten and were her best friends, Regan and Cordie still didn’t know what her father actually did for a living. Every time one of them asked him, he came up with a different answer. Either he was changing occupations once a month, or he was making it up as he went along. For a long time, Regan thought he was in banking, and Cordie believed he was a real estate mogul. Now that they were older and had heard all the rumors and speculation, they knew Sophie’s father was into some shady dealings. He was always cooking up one scheme after another, and they now worried that it was only a matter of time before one of his schemes backfired. Regan worried about Sophie. As sophisticated as her friend considered herself to be, she was horribly naive about her father. And extremely protective. Cordie looked as if she wanted to continue to argue. Regan, determined to get her friends back on track, asked, “What’s the plan once we’re inside the conference center?” “We join the reception and … look around.” Regan glanced at Cordie. “What do you mean ‘look around’?” she asked. “Yes,” Cordie said. “Exactly what are we looking for?” Sophie grabbed her purse and opened the back door. “His computer. I’ve done some checking and know the registrations and records are computerized. I also found out he carries a laptop computer with him and I’m hoping that sometime this weekend we can get to it.” “Uh-oh, I don’t like the sound of that,” Cordie said. “You can’t be thinking about breaking into his computer,” Regan said, appalled at the idea. Sophie laughed. She waited until both of her friends had gotten out of the car before answering. “No, of course not. I don’t have the skill to break into his computer. Cordie will have to do it.” “No way. I’m not doing anything illegal.” “I need to get into his records,” Sophie argued. “It’s the only way I can find out about the other women he’s scammed.” “His bodyguards aren’t going to let any of us near his computer,” Regan said. “We’ve got all weekend to try.” “Sophie, please tell me there’s more to the plan than breaking the law,” Regan said. “Of course there is,” Sophie said. “We’re here to investigate. We’re going to talk to every person who signed up, and maybe someone knows something that will help us.” “Like what?” Cordie asked. “Like who Shields has been seeing,” she said. “We have to play this by ear.” “Sounds like we’re playing it by the seat of our pants,” Cordie said. “How does she talk us into these things?” Regan asked. She was trying not to laugh. “She always makes her plans sound … reasonable.” “Hello. I’m right here. I can hear every word you’re saying.” Cordie and Regan ignored her. “It’s a lousy way to spend the weekend,” Cordie complained. “But it’s for a good cause,” Sophie said. “And it’s too late to back out.” Cordie looked up at the sky. “It’s going to rain. Damn, my hair’s going to frizz.” “Are we going to stand here all night or what?” Regan asked. Cordie and Sophie took the lead across the dark parking lot. Regan’s knee was throbbing, so she walked at a more sedate pace, trying not to limp. She cursed herself for wearing impractical shoes. “Slow down,” Cordie said. “Regan’s having trouble with her knee again. When are you going to get that surgery?” “Soon,” she said. So they wouldn’t nag her into doing what she wasn’t ready to do, she switched subjects. “My car needs an oil change. Are you up to it, Cordie?” “Sure. I’ll do it next weekend.” Sophie rolled her eyes. “You spend more time under the hood of a car than a mechanic, Cordie. I swear, I’m never going to understand the two of you. You can afford any car you want, and yet you both drive old heaps. But then, I guess we know why Regan keeps her heap.” “Aiden.” She and Cordie said his name at the same time. “It makes him crazy, doesn’t it?” Sophie said laughing. She hurried ahead and waited at the door for her friends to catch up. “Okay, ladies. Time to concentrate on the task at hand.” Liam House was an old stone building that had seen many uses in its lifetime. It now served as a facility for seminars and retreats. The interior was a pleasant surprise. Newly remodeled, the marble floors gleamed against the soft, warm beige of the walls. The registration table was on the opposite end of a rectangular foyer. A thirtysomething woman, wearing the name tag “Debbie,” sat behind a table handing out registration forms. She wore a bright periwinkle blue flannel blazer. Behind her, dangling down from the balcony, were two twelve-foot-long banners. Each had a life-size photo of Dr. Shields. In both banners, Shields wore the same periwinkle blazer and the same smile. “Is the guy a psychologist or a realtor?” Cordie whispered. Sophie nudged her. “Notice the laptop?” “It’s on the table right in front of me. How could I not notice? Do you want to distract her so I can grab it and run?” Cordie asked sarcastically. “Get with the program,” Sophie whispered. All three of them filled out their registration forms. Sophie handed them to Debbie. “The fee’s a thousand dollars for each of you, hon.” “Yes, we know,” Sophie said as she handed the wad of cash to the woman. Debbie took her time counting the hundred-dollar bills. Satisfied the amount was accurate, she typed their names from their registration cards into her computer, pushed a button, and the printer on the table behind her immediately spit out three receipts. “Dr. Shields is in the living room with some of the other participants. We’re having a welcome reception, and you won’t want to miss it. The doctor does such marvelous exercises.” “Exercises?” Regan asked. “Challenges,” Debbie corrected. “Mental challenges. That’s what Dr. Shields calls them. He helps you pull out all the anger and bitterness and hostility that’s eating away at your creativity, and once you’ve gotten all that poison out, you can move in a more positive direction. He really changed my life,” she added. “And he’ll change your life too if you work with him and trust him.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/murder-list-buchanan-renard-4/page-10.html","bookId":2674,"book":{"id":2674,"title":"Murder List (Buchanan-Renard #4)","description":"Storyline: There are few authors who can weave nail-biting thrills, edge-of-your-seat drama, and romantic suspense as masterfully as Julie Garwood. Now she ratchets up the tension with Murder List, in which evil is on the hunt– and proves to be methodically organized and chillingly successful. When Chicago detective Alec Buchanan is offered a prime position with the FBI, it is the perfect opportunity to leave the Windy City and follow in his brothers’ footsteps to the top echelons of law enforcement. But first he must complete one last assignment (and one that he is not too happy about): acting as a glorified bodyguard to hotel heiress Regan Hamilton Madison. The gorgeous exec has become entangled in some potentially deadly business. Someone has e-mailed her a graphic crime-scene photo–and the victim is no stranger. Regan suspects that the trouble started when she agreed to help a journalist friend expose a shady self-help guru who preys on lonely, vulnerable women. In fact, the smooth-as-an-oil-slick Dr. Lawrence Shields may be responsible for the death of one of his devotees, which was ruled a suicide. Hoping to find some damning evidence, Regan attends a Shields seminar. At the gathering, the doctor persuades his guests to partake in an innocent little “cleansing” exercise. He asks them to make a list of the people who have hurt or deceived them over the years, posing the question: Would your world be a better place if these people ceased to exist? Treating the exercise as a game, Regan plays along. After ten minutes, Shields instructs the participants to bring their sheets of paper to the fireplace and throw them into the flames. But Regan misses this part of the program when she exits the room to take a call–and barely escapes a menacing individual in the parking lot. The experience is all but forgotten–until the first person on Regan’s list turns up dead. Shock turns to horror when other bodies from the list start to surface, as a harrowing tango of desire and death is set into motion. Now brutal murders seem to stalk her every move–and a growing attraction to Alec may compromise her safety, while stirring up tender emotions she thought she could no longer feel. Yet as the danger intensifies and a serial killer circles ever closer, Regan must discover who has turned her private revenge fantasies into grisly reality.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/murder-list-buchanan-renard-4.jpg","author":"Julie Garwood","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/murder-list-buchanan-renard-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:04 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:01:53 AM"}}
