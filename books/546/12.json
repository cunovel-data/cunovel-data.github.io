{"id":41869,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"IT must a been close on to one o\u0027clock when we got below the island at last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore; and it was well a boat didn\u0027t come, for we hadn\u0027t ever thought to put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat. We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things. It warn\u0027t good judgment to put EVERYTHING on the raft. \n If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I built, and watched it all night for Jim to come. Anyways, they stayed away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn\u0027t no fault of mine. I played it as low down on them as I could. \n When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cave-in in the bank there. A towhead is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth. \n We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we warn\u0027t afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn\u0027t set down and watch a camp fire -- no, sir, she\u0027d fetch a dog. Well, then, I said, why couldn\u0027t she tell her husband to fetch a dog? Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that time, or else we wouldn\u0027t be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the village -- no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again. So I said I didn\u0027t care what was the reason they didn\u0027t get us as long as they didn\u0027t. \n When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn\u0027t have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a \"crossing\"; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn\u0027t always run the channel, but hunted easy water. \n This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn\u0027t ever feel like talking loud, and it warn\u0027t often that we laughed -- only a little kind of a low chuckle. We had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all -- that night, nor the next, nor the next. \n Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides, nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up. In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at two o\u0027clock that still night. There warn\u0027t a sound there; everybody was asleep. \n Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o\u0027clock at some little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents\u0027 worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn\u0027t roosting comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a chicken when you get a chance, because if you don\u0027t want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain\u0027t ever forgot. I never see pap when he didn\u0027t want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to say, anyway. \n Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of that kind. Pap always said it warn\u0027t no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn\u0027t anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it. Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we wouldn\u0027t borrow them any more -- then he reckoned it wouldn\u0027t be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked it over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons, or what. But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p\u0027simmons. We warn\u0027t feeling just right before that, but it was all comfortable now. I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain\u0027t ever good, and the p\u0027simmons wouldn\u0027t be ripe for two or three months yet. \n We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or didn\u0027t go to bed early enough in the evening. Take it all round, we lived pretty high. \n The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself. When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead, and high, rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I, \"Hel-LO, Jim, looky yonder!\" It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock. We was drifting straight down for her. The lightning showed her very distinct. She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it, when the flashes come. \n Well, it being away in the night and stormy, and all so mysterious-like, I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river. I wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little, and see what there was there. So I says: \n \"Le\u0027s land on her, Jim.\" \n But Jim was dead against it at first. He says: \n \"I doan\u0027 want to go fool\u0027n \u0027long er no wrack. We\u0027s doin\u0027 blame\u0027 well, en we better let blame\u0027 well alone, as de good book says. Like as not dey\u0027s a watchman on dat wrack.\" \n \"Watchman your grandmother,\" I says; \"there ain\u0027t nothing to watch but the texas and the pilothouse; and do you reckon anybody\u0027s going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this, when it\u0027s likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute?\" Jim couldn\u0027t say nothing to that, so he didn\u0027t try. \"And besides,\" I says, \"we might borrow something worth having out of the captain\u0027s stateroom. Seegars, I bet you -- and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and THEY don\u0027t care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it. Stick a candle in your pocket; I can\u0027t rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging. Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing? Not for pie, he wouldn\u0027t. He\u0027d call it an adventure -- that\u0027s what he\u0027d call it; and he\u0027d land on that wreck if it was his last act. And wouldn\u0027t he throw style into it? -- wouldn\u0027t he spread himself, nor nothing? Why, you\u0027d think it was Christopher C\u0027lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come. I wish Tom Sawyer WAS here.\" \n Jim he grumbled a little, but give in. He said we mustn\u0027t talk any more than we could help, and then talk mighty low. The lightning showed us the wreck again just in time, and we fetched the stabboard derrick, and made fast there. \n The deck was high out here. We went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard, in the dark, towards the texas, feeling our way slow with our feet, and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys, for it was so dark we couldn\u0027t see no sign of them. Pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight, and clumb on to it; and the next step fetched us in front of the captain\u0027s door, which was open, and by Jimminy, away down through the texas-hall we see a light! and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder! \n Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick, and told me to come along. I says, all right, and was going to start for the raft; but just then I heard a voice wail out and say: \n \"Oh, please don\u0027t, boys; I swear I won\u0027t ever tell!\" \n Another voice said, pretty loud: \n \"It\u0027s a lie, Jim Turner. You\u0027ve acted this way before. You always want more\u0027n your share of the truck, and you\u0027ve always got it, too, because you\u0027ve swore \u0027t if you didn\u0027t you\u0027d tell. But this time you\u0027ve said it jest one time too many. You\u0027re the meanest, treacherousest hound in this country.\" \n By this time Jim was gone for the raft. I was just a-biling with curiosity; and I says to myself, Tom Sawyer wouldn\u0027t back out now, and so I won\u0027t either; I\u0027m a-going to see what\u0027s going on here. So I dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage, and crept aft in the dark till there warn\u0027t but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas. Then in there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot, and two men standing over him, and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand, and the other one had a pistol. This one kept pointing the pistol at the man\u0027s head on the floor, and saying: \n \"I\u0027d LIKE to! And I orter, too -- a mean skunk!\" \n The man on the floor would shrivel up and say, \"Oh, please don\u0027t, Bill; I hain\u0027t ever goin\u0027 to tell.\" \n And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say: \n \"\u0027Deed you AIN\u0027T! You never said no truer thing \u0027n that, you bet you.\" And once he said: \"Hear him beg! and yit if we hadn\u0027t got the best of him and tied him he\u0027d a killed us both. And what FOR? Jist for noth\u0027n. Jist because we stood on our RIGHTS -- that\u0027s what for. But I lay you ain\u0027t a-goin\u0027 to threaten nobody any more, Jim Turner. Put UP that pistol, Bill.\" \n Bill says: \n \"I don\u0027t want to, Jake Packard. I\u0027m for killin\u0027 him -- and didn\u0027t he kill old Hatfield jist the same way -- and don\u0027t he deserve it?\" \n \"But I don\u0027t WANT him killed, and I\u0027ve got my reasons for it.\" \n \"Bless yo\u0027 heart for them words, Jake Packard! I\u0027ll never forgit you long\u0027s I live!\" says the man on the floor, sort of blubbering. \n Packard didn\u0027t take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill to come. I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat slanted so that I couldn\u0027t make very good time; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side. The man came apawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my stateroom, he says: \n \"Here -- come in here.\" \n And in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn\u0027t see them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they\u0027d been having. I was glad I didn\u0027t drink whisky; but it wouldn\u0027t made much difference anyway, because most of the time they couldn\u0027t a treed me because I didn\u0027t breathe. I was too scared. And, besides, a body COULDN\u0027T breathe and hear such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted to kill Turner. He says: \n \"He\u0027s said he\u0027ll tell, and he will. If we was to give both our shares to him NOW it wouldn\u0027t make no difference after the row and the way we\u0027ve served him. Shore\u0027s you\u0027re born, he\u0027ll turn State\u0027s evidence; now you hear ME. I\u0027m for putting him out of his troubles.\" \n \"So\u0027m I,\" says Packard, very quiet. \n \"Blame it, I\u0027d sorter begun to think you wasn誸. Well, then, that\u0027s all right. Le\u0027s go and do it.\" \n \"Hold on a minute; I hain\u0027t had my say yit. You listen to me. Shooting\u0027s good, but there\u0027s quieter ways if the thing\u0027s GOT to be done. But what I say is this: it ain\u0027t good sense to go court\u0027n around after a halter if you can git at what you\u0027re up to in some way that\u0027s jist as good and at the same time don\u0027t bring you into no resks. Ain\u0027t that so?\" \n \"You bet it is. But how you goin\u0027 to manage it this time?\" \n \"Well, my idea is this: we\u0027ll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we\u0027ve overlooked in the staterooms, and shove for shore and hide the truck. Then we\u0027ll wait. Now I say it ain\u0027t a-goin\u0027 to be more\u0027n two hours befo\u0027 this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river. See? He\u0027ll be drownded, and won\u0027t have nobody to blame for it but his own self. I reckon that\u0027s a considerble sight better \u0027n killin\u0027 of him. I\u0027m unfavorable to killin\u0027 a man as long as you can git aroun\u0027 it; it ain\u0027t good sense, it ain\u0027t good morals. Ain\u0027t I right?\" \n \"Yes, I reck\u0027n you are. But s\u0027pose she DON\u0027T break up and wash off?\" \n \"Well, we can wait the two hours anyway and see, can\u0027t we?\" \n \"All right, then; come along.\" \n So they started, and I lit out, all in a cold sweat, and scrambled forward. It was dark as pitch there; but I said, in a kind of a coarse whisper, \"Jim !\" and he answered up, right at my elbow, with a sort of a moan, and I says: \n \"Quick, Jim, it ain\u0027t no time for fooling around and moaning; there\u0027s a gang of murderers in yonder, and if we don\u0027t hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows can\u0027t get away from the wreck there\u0027s one of \u0027em going to be in a bad fix. But if we find their boat we can put ALL of \u0027em in a bad fix -- for the sheriff \u0027ll get \u0027em. Quick -- hurry! I\u0027ll hunt the labboard side, you hunt the stabboard. You start at the raft, and --\" \n \"Oh, my lordy, lordy! RAF\u0027? Dey ain\u0027 no raf\u0027 no mo\u0027; she done broke loose en gone I -- en here we is!\" \n 如果那两个人上岛，我就算计着他们找到了我生的那堆火，随后在火堆旁守上整整一夜，等着吉姆。无论怎样，他们和我们已经离得很远了，如果我生的火一点儿没骗住他们，那也不怪我。我跟他们玩的这个把戏，也算缺德到家了。\n 天刚透出第一缕亮光，我们就把木排系到伊利诺斯岸边一个大河湾里的浅滩上，用斧头砍了些白杨树枝盖住了它，这样看起来，如同河岸在那儿塌进去一块似的。浅滩就是沙洲，上面长满了锯齿一样密密的白杨。\n 密苏里河岸上是山，伊利诺斯岸边是密林，河水在这儿是靠密苏里河岸流淌，因此我们不怕被人碰上。我们一整天都躺着，看木排和轮船打着旋儿冲往密苏里那边，上水的轮船在河中间费力挣扎。我把我和那个妇人聊的话都讲给了吉姆；吉姆说她是聪明女人，要是她亲自来追我们，她一定不会坐下来等着一堆篝火--不，先生，她会牵条狗来。那样的话，我说，她难道不知道告诉她丈夫这么做吗？吉姆说他敢打赌，在那两个人要动身时，她确实想到了这一点，他还相信他们一定是到镇上去找狗了，这样他们就把时间全给耽误了，否则，我们就不会在那个村子下面十六七英里远的这个沙洲上了--不，说实在话，我们又会在那个老镇上了。于是我说，我不管他们究竟是什么原因没抓住我们，只要不被他们抓着就好。\n 天刚刚黑下来，我们就从白杨树丛中探出头，四下张望，什么也没看见。于是，吉姆拿起木排上面的木板搭了个舒适的小窝棚，来躺避日晒雨淋，还可以保持东西干燥。吉姆还在窝棚里搭起地板，比木排面垫高了一英尺多，这样，毯子和其他的东西都能避免被轮船掀起的波浪打湿了。在窝棚的当中，我们堆一层六英寸厚的土，用木板把土固定住，这是为遇上雨天或冷天生火用的。小窝棚会挡住火，人们不会看见。我们又做了个掌舵的桨，因为原有的桨大概会碰在暗礁或别的什么东西上给折断。我们竖起一根分叉的木棍，把那盏旧提灯挂上；因为一碰上轮船顺手开过来，我们就得点亮灯，防止被撞翻。只是，我们不必为上水的船点灯，除非是我们看见自己处在人们称做横流的地方，由于水位还很高，河岸低洼地还淹在水下一点儿，因此水上的船只并不一直在走主河道，偶尔也找平静的水面走。\n 第二个晚上，我们走了七八个小时。顺着水流一小时划四英里多。我们钓鱼聊天，有时下河游泳，免得打盹。在静静的大河上顺流而下，仰望群星，还真有些庄严肃穆的感觉，我们从不愿大声说话，也不怎么开口大笑，只是有时候低低地格格几声。总体而言，我们一直遇着好天气，什么事儿也没碰着，不论是当天夜里，还是第二夜，还是下一夜。\n 每个晚上，我们都经过一些城镇，有时远远地处在黑暗的山坡上，全是一片亮亮的灯火，一座房也看不见。第五天晚上，我们经过圣路易斯，仿佛全世界都亮着灯。在圣彼得堡，他们总是说圣路易斯有两三万人，可我以前从不相信，直至在那个静静的夜晚两点钟时，我看到了那奇妙的万家灯火，才深信不疑。那儿一点声音都没有，人们都在熟睡。\n 如今，每天晚上，我总会偷偷摸到岸上，在临近十点钟左右，到一些小村庄上，去买一毛或一毛五分钱的玉米面或咸猪肉或其他吃的东西，有时，我也拎起一只不好好进窝的鸡，带上就走。爸总是说，有机会就抓只鸡，因为要是你不想自己要，总容易找到别人要，做了好事就不会被忘掉。我可是从未见过爸自己不想要的时候，不过反正他老是那么说。\n 清晨，在天亮之前，我摸进玉米地，借个西瓜，或借个香瓜，或是南瓜，或是新玉米，或者类似的东西。爸老说借东西没什么害处，只要你将来有意偿还，可寡妇说那只不过是比说偷好听罢了，没一个体面人会做那种事。吉姆说他认为寡妇说的有点儿道理，爸说的也有点儿对，所以最好的办法是我们从上面说的东西里挑上两三样，而且说我们不再借这些东西了--这样，他再想去借其他东西就不会有什么害处了。于是一天晚上，我们把这个问题来来回回地谈了一遍，一边顺着大河往下漂，一边想拿定主意是丢下西瓜，还是甜瓜，还是香瓜，还是别的什么。不过快到天明时，我们就把问题全都圆满地解决了，结论是扔掉山楂和柿子。这以前我们一直觉得不大对劲儿，不过现在可是彻底地好受了。我对这个结果也很高兴，因为山楂一点儿也不好吃，而柿子得再等上两三个月才会熟。我们偶尔也打只水鸟，打那些早上起得太早或是晚上睡得不够早的鸟儿。总体说来，我们过得挺快活。\n 第五天夜里，在圣路易斯下边，半夜过后，我们遇上了一场大暴风雨，电闪雷鸣，来势汹汹，大雨白茫茫一片，倾盆而下。我们呆在窝棚里，任由木排自己漂。雷电闪过时，我们看到前边河水直立，两岸石岩峭壁高耸。不一阵，我叫到：\"　喂--，吉姆，看那儿！\"　那是一条轮船触礁毁了。我们正直向它漂去。闪电把它照得异常清楚。它斜了过去，甲板的一部分还露在水面。一有闪电划过，一条条拉住烟囱的铁索看得清清楚楚，大钟旁边有把椅子，一顶破烂的垂边儿帽还垂在椅子背上。\n 夜已深了，还是风雨交加，四周神神秘秘的，看着那条沉船凄惨孤单地斜歪在河中心，我跟任何其他男孩子的想法都差不多。我想上船稍微走一圈儿，看看上面都有什么。于是，我说：\"我们上去吧，吉姆。\"可是吉姆开始死不赞成。他说：\"我可不愿意到沉船上瞎转悠晃荡。我们现在过得绝对是好极了，最好就这么好下去，就跟那部好书圣经上说的那样。没准那沉船上有人看守。\"\"看守你个奶奶！\"　我说，\"　除掉前顶舱和舵手室，啥也没有；你难道认为在这样的风雨黑夜，为一个前顶舱和舵手室会有人乐意冒生命危险吗？它又随时都会撞碎，被河水冲走。\"吉姆什么理由也说不出来，因此他也就不说了。\n \"还有，\"我说，\"　没准从船长的特等舱里，我们还能借点值钱东西呢。雪茄，我敢打赌--一支值五分钱，响当当的硬币。轮船上的船长都很有钱，一个月挣60　块，他们这种人才不会在乎一样东西花多少钱呢，只要他们想买就行。口袋里装支蜡烛吧，我踏实不了，吉姆，我们一定要把它搜个遍儿。你认为汤姆·索亚会放过这种事吗？绝对不，他不会的。他叫这是历险--他就是这么叫的，就算是送命他也要上那条沉船。他还不派头十足？他还不神气活现？会无动于衷？啊，你会觉得那是克利斯托弗·哥伦布发现了天国新大陆。我真希望汤姆·索亚就在身边。\"吉姆嘟哝了一会儿，还是屈服了。他说我们拿东西千万别贪多，说话尽量低声。闪电又给我们把那条沉船照亮了，十分及时，我们抓住右舷上的吊车，将木排拴到那上面。\n 甲板在这儿高高翘起。我们静静地顺着甲板斜坡摸下左舷，在黑暗中向特等舱摸索，用脚探着路，伸出手把铁索挡开，由于夜黑得我们什么也看不见。很快地，我们碰到了天窗前面那头，爬了上去；又爬一步到了船长室的前面，门敞开着。哎呀，天哪，穿过船顶舱通道，远远地看到有灯光！差不多就在同一时刻，我们仿佛听见那边有低低的说话声！\n 吉姆趴在我耳边说他觉得十分不对劲儿，告诉我跟他快走。我说，好吧。正要挪步向木排走，可正在此时，我听见一个声音哭着说：\"噢，别这样，弟兄们：我发誓我决不往外说！\"另一个声音说，噪门挺大：\"这是撒谎，吉姆·特纳。以前你就耍过这一套。你要的总比你应得的那一份儿多，你也总能拿到手，因为你发誓说你要拿不到手，就要去告发。但是这一次你说一遍就已经够了。你是个这个国家最卑鄙最阴险的大坏蛋。\"这时，吉姆已经朝大排那边去了。我却好奇得要命，我心想，汤姆·索亚这时候是怎么也不会退走，我也不；我要看看这儿是怎么回事。我就用双手和膝盖着地，在那个窄窄的通道里，摸着黑朝后爬，一直爬到我和船顶舱的过廊之间只隔一个特等舱了。在那里，我看到一个人躺倒在地板上，手脚都被捆着，还有两个人站在他身旁，其中一个人拿手提着盏昏暗的灯笼，另一个人拿一把手枪。那人总是把枪对着地板上那人的脑袋，一边说：\"我就想这么着！我也应该这么干，你这个无耻的家伙！\"地板上那个人吓得缩成一团，嘴里说：\"啊，别这样，毕尔--我决不会说出去。\"每回他说这话，提灯的那个人就笑：\"你的确不会！你还从来没说过比这更真实的话，也真是的。\"　一次他又说：\"　听他乞求吧！可要不是我们仔细地收拾了他一顿又将他捆了起来，他会杀了我们俩。究竟为什么？什么也不因为。就是因为我们要我们那一份儿--就是为这个。不过我敢说你再也唬不住谁了，吉姆·特纳。收起枪，毕尔。\"毕尔说：\"我不打算收，杰克·帕克德。我要杀了他。他不就是这么杀了老哈特菲尔德吗？难道他这不是罪有应得吗？\"\"可我不想把他杀掉，我自有我的道理。\"\"上帝保佑你，你好心说这话，杰克·帕克德！我绝对不会忘了你，只要我能活着！\"　地板上那人赶忙说，还在不住哭泣。\n 帕克德没理他，而是把灯挂在钉子上，朝我这边走来，到了黑影里，招呼毕尔过来。我尽力后退，退了大约两码，但那只船倾得太厉害了，我退不快；为了不让他们踩着我，把我抓住，我爬进特等舱上铺。那人从黑暗中摸索着过来，这当儿，帕克德来到我藏身的特等舱，他说：\"这儿--上这儿来。\"他进来了，毕尔跟着他。他们进来之前，我已躲在上铺了，挤到一个角落里，不停地后悔自己进来了。接着他们就站在那里，手搭着床架说话。我看不见他们，可是我知道他们在哪里，因为能闻出来他们喝的威士忌味儿。我很高兴我没喝酒，不过反正那也没什么大碍。因为他们不大有可能找到我，因为我都不敢出气。我太害怕了。再说，听这种谈话，一个人也不可能会出气。他们说话的声音很低，又相当急切。毕尔想杀掉特纳。他说：\"他说过他要告发，他就会去。（现在），就算把我们那两份儿全都给他，他也还是会去告发的，因为我们同他吵了架，还收拾了他。这肯定不会错的，他会去作证供出我们。现在你听我的，我主张送他回老家。\"\"我也是。\"　帕克德说，他十分镇静。\n \"真混，我开始还以为你不赞成呢。那么，这就好办多了，咱们动手吧。\"\"再等一阵，我的话还未讲完。你听着，打死他好办，不过要把这事儿做了，还有更好的办法可以做得悄无声息，我要讲的就是这个。总是去惹官司，把绞索往自己脖子上套不是什么好主意，关键是要想出个好办法，同样地达到自己的目的，同时又不致于让自己有麻烦。这话有道理吗？\"\"你说得很对。不过眼下你打算怎么办？\"\"好，我的主意是这样：我们赶快动手，把我们遗留在特等舱里的东西全收拾起来，运到岸上藏个地方。然后我们就等着。从现在起我估摸着不到两个小时，这条船就会被撞碎，被河水冲走。明白没有？他会给淹死，除了他自己谁都不能怨。只要能把事办成，我不赞成杀人，那办法不好，也不道德。我的话有没有道理？\"\"对--我觉得对。不过如果船撞不碎也没让大水冲走呢？\"\"那样，我们还能等上两个小时，不管怎样，等等看吧，好不好？\"\"那好吧，我们走。\"随即他们就走开了。我悄悄出来，出了一身冷汗，爬着向前摸。四处漆黑一片；我还是压着嗓子低声叫\"吉姆！\"　他马上回答，原来他就在我胳膊肘一侧，声音凄切，我说：\"快点，吉姆，没有时间在这儿乱摸索瞎叹气了，里边是一群杀人犯，如果我们找不到他们的小船，就让它顺水漂走，这些家伙就会从沉船上逃走，他们当中有一个人就得困死这里。要是我们找到他们的小船，我们就能让他们全都困在这里，警察就会来抓他们。快，赶快！我找左边，你找右边。你从木排那儿开始，再..\"\"啊！我的天哪！天哪！木排？再也没有木排了，绳子断了，它被冲走了，我们也给困在这里啦！\"\n
