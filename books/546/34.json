{"id":41891,"no":34,"title":"Chapter 34","content":"WE stopped talking, and got to thinking. By and by Tom says: \\n\\n \"Looky here, Huck, what fools we are to not think of it before! I bet I know where Jim is.\" \\n\\n \"No! Where?\" \\n\\n \"In that hut down by the ash-hopper. Why, looky here. When we was at dinner, didn\u0027t you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles?\" \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \"What did you think the vittles was for?\" \\n\\n \"For a dog.\" \\n\\n \"So \u0027d I. Well, it wasn\u0027t for a dog.\" \\n\\n \"Why?\" \\n\\n \"Because part of it was watermelon.\" \\n\\n \"So it was -- I noticed it. Well, it does beat all that I never thought about a dog not eating watermelon. It shows how a body can see and don\u0027t see at the same time.\" \\n\\n \"Well, the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in, and he locked it again when he came out. He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from table -- same key, I bet. Watermelon shows man, lock shows prisoner; and it ain\u0027t likely there\u0027s two prisoners on such a little plantation, and where the people\u0027s all so kind and good. Jim\u0027s the prisoner. All right -- I\u0027m glad we found it out detective fashion; I wouldn\u0027t give shucks for any other way. Now you work your mind, and study out a plan to steal Jim, and I will study out one, too; and we\u0027ll take the one we like the best.\" \\n\\n What a head for just a boy to have! If I had Tom Sawyer\u0027s head I wouldn\u0027t trade it off to be a duke, nor mate of a steamboat, nor clown in a circus, nor nothing I can think of. I went to thinking out a plan, but only just to be doing something; I knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from. Pretty soon Tom says: \\n\\n \"Ready?\" \\n\\n \"Yes,\" I says. \\n\\n \"All right -- bring it out.\" \\n\\n \"My plan is this,\" I says. \"We can easy find out if it\u0027s Jim in there. Then get up my canoe to-morrow night, and fetch my raft over from the island. Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man\u0027s britches after he goes to bed, and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim, hiding daytimes and running nights, the way me and Jim used to do before. Wouldn\u0027t that plan work?\" \\n\\n \"WORK? Why, cert\u0027nly it would work, like rats a-fighting. But it\u0027s too blame\u0027 simple; there ain\u0027t nothing TO it. What\u0027s the good of a plan that ain\u0027t no more trouble than that? It\u0027s as mild as goose-milk. Why, Huck, it wouldn\u0027t make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory.\" \\n\\n I never said nothing, because I warn\u0027t expecting nothing different; but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got HIS plan ready it wouldn\u0027t have none of them objections to it. \\n\\n And it didn\u0027t. He told me what it was, and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style, and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would, and maybe get us all killed besides. So I was satisfied, and said we would waltz in on it. I needn\u0027t tell what it was here, because I knowed it wouldn\u0027t stay the way, it was. I knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along, and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance. And that is what he done. \\n\\n Well, one thing was dead sure, and that was that Tom Sawyer was in earnest, and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery. That was the thing that was too many for me. Here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up; and had a character to lose; and folks at home that had characters; and he was bright and not leather-headed; and knowing and not ignorant; and not mean, but kind; and yet here he was, without any more pride, or rightness, or feeling, than to stoop to this business, and make himself a shame, and his family a shame, before everybody. I COULDN\u0027T understand it no way at all. It was outrageous, and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so; and so be his true friend, and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself. And I DID start to tell him; but he shut me up, and says: \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you reckon I know what I\u0027m about? Don\u0027t I generly know what I\u0027m about?\" \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t I SAY I was going to help steal the nigger?\" \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \"WELL, then.\" \\n\\n That\u0027s all he said, and that\u0027s all I said. It warn\u0027t no use to say any more; because when he said he\u0027d do a thing, he always done it. But I couldn\u0027t make out how he was willing to go into this thing; so I just let it go, and never bothered no more about it. If he was bound to have it so, I couldn\u0027t help it. \\n\\n When we got home the house was all dark and still; so we went on down to the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it. We went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do. They knowed us, and didn\u0027t make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night. When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides; and on the side I warn\u0027t acquainted with -- which was the north side -- we found a square windowhole, up tolerable high, with just one stout board nailed across it. I says: \\n\\n \"Here\u0027s the ticket. This hole\u0027s big enough for Jim to get through if we wrench off the board.\" \\n\\n Tom says: \\n\\n \"It\u0027s as simple as tit-tat-toe, three-in-a-row, and as easy as playing hooky. I should HOPE we can find a way that\u0027s a little more complicated than THAT, Huck Finn.\" \\n\\n \"Well, then,\" I says, \"how \u0027ll it do to saw him out, the way I done before I was murdered that time?\" \\n\\n \"That\u0027s more LIKE,\" he says. \"It\u0027s real mysterious, and troublesome, and good,\" he says; \"but I bet we can find a way that\u0027s twice as long. There ain\u0027t no hurry; le\u0027s keep on looking around.\" \\n\\n Betwixt the hut and the fence, on the back side, was a lean-to that joined the hut at the eaves, and was made out of plank. It was as long as the hut, but narrow -- only about six foot wide. The door to it was at the south end, and was padlocked. Tom he went to the soap-kettle and searched around, and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with; so he took it and prized out one of the staples. The chain fell down, and we opened the door and went in, and shut it, and struck a match, and see the shed was only built against a cabin and hadn\u0027t no connection with it; and there warn\u0027t no floor to the shed, nor nothing in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow. The match went out, and so did we, and shoved in the staple again, and the door was locked as good as ever. Tom was joyful. He says; \\n\\n \"Now we\u0027re all right. We\u0027ll DIG him out. It \u0027ll take about a week!\" \\n\\n Then we started for the house, and I went in the back door -- you only have to pull a buckskin latchstring, they don\u0027t fasten the doors -- but that warn\u0027t romantical enough for Tom Sawyer; no way would do him but he must climb up the lightning-rod. But after he got up half way about three times, and missed fire and fell every time, and the last time most busted his brains out, he thought he\u0027d got to give it up; but after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck, and this time he made the trip. \\n\\n In the morning we was up at break of day, and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim -- if it WAS Jim that was being fed. The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields; and Jim\u0027s nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things; and whilst the others was leaving, the key come from the house. \\n\\n This nigger had a good-natured, chuckle-headed face, and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread. That was to keep witches off. He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights, and making him see all kinds of strange things, and hear all kinds of strange words and noises, and he didn\u0027t believe he was ever witched so long before in his life. He got so worked up, and got to running on so about his troubles, he forgot all about what he\u0027d been a-going to do. So Tom says: \\n\\n \"What\u0027s the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs?\" \\n\\n The nigger kind of smiled around graduly over his face, like when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle, and he says: \\n\\n \"Yes, Mars Sid, A dog. Cur\u0027us dog, too. Does you want to go en look at \u0027im?\" \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n I hunched Tom, and whispers: \\n\\n \"You going, right here in the daybreak? THAT warn\u0027t the plan.\" \\n\\n \"No, it warn\u0027t; but it\u0027s the plan NOW.\" \\n\\n So, drat him, we went along, but I didn\u0027t like it much. When we got in we couldn\u0027t hardly see anything, it was so dark; but Jim was there, sure enough, and could see us; and he sings out: \\n\\n \"Why, HUCK! En good LAN\u0027! ain\u0027 dat Misto Tom?\" \\n\\n I just knowed how it would be; I just expected it. I didn\u0027t know nothing to do; and if I had I couldn\u0027t a done it, because that nigger busted in and says: \\n\\n \"Why, de gracious sakes! do he know you genlmen?\" \\n\\n We could see pretty well now. Tom he looked at the nigger, steady and kind of wondering, and says: \\n\\n \"Does WHO know us?\" \\n\\n \"Why, dis-yer runaway nigger.\" \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t reckon he does; but what put that into your head?\" \\n\\n \"What PUT it dar? Didn\u0027 he jis\u0027 dis minute sing out like he knowed you?\" \\n\\n Tom says, in a puzzled-up kind of way: \\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s mighty curious. WHO sung out? WHEN did he sing out? WHAT did he sing out?\" And turns to me, perfectly ca\u0027m, and says, \"Did YOU hear anybody sing out?\" \\n\\n Of course there warn\u0027t nothing to be said but the one thing; so I says: \\n\\n \"No; I ain\u0027t heard nobody say nothing.\" \\n\\n Then he turns to Jim, and looks him over like he never see him before, and says: \\n\\n \"Did you sing out?\" \\n\\n \"No, sah,\" says Jim; \" I hain\u0027t said nothing, sah.\" \\n\\n \"Not a word?\" \\n\\n \"No, sah, I hain\u0027t said a word.\" \\n\\n \"Did you ever see us before?\" \\n\\n \"No, sah; not as I knows on.\" \\n\\n So Tom turns to the nigger, which was looking wild and distressed, and says, kind of severe: \\n\\n \"What do you reckon\u0027s the matter with you, anyway? What made you think somebody sung out?\" \\n\\n \"Oh, it\u0027s de dad-blame\u0027 witches, sah, en I wisht I was dead, I do. Dey\u0027s awluz at it, sah, en dey do mos\u0027 kill me, dey sk\u0027yers me so. Please to don\u0027t tell nobody \u0027bout it sah, er ole Mars Silas he\u0027ll scole me; \u0027kase he say dey AIN\u0027T no witches. I jis\u0027 wish to goodness he was heah now -- DEN what would he say! I jis\u0027 bet he couldn\u0027 fine no way to git aroun\u0027 it DIS time. But it\u0027s awluz jis\u0027 so; people dat\u0027s SOT, stays sot; dey won\u0027t look into noth\u0027n\u0027en fine it out f\u0027r deyselves, en when YOU fine it out en tell um \u0027bout it, dey doan\u0027 b\u0027lieve you.\" \\n\\n Tom give him a dime, and said we wouldn\u0027t tell nobody; and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with; and then looks at Jim, and says: \\n\\n \"I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger. If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away, I wouldn\u0027t give him up, I\u0027d hang him.\" And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good, he whispers to Jim and says: \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t ever let on to know us. And if you hear any digging going on nights, it\u0027s us; we\u0027re going to set you free.\" \\n\\n Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it; then the nigger come back, and we said we\u0027d come again some time if the nigger wanted us to; and he said he would, more particular if it was dark, because the witches went for him mostly in the dark, and it was good to have folks around then. \\n\\n 　　大约在我们吃完饭离开饭桌之时，他交给姨父一把钥匙，我猜必定是那把钥匙。西瓜说明有人，锁说明是个犯人。这么一个小小的农场，这儿的人又都这么和善，不可能会有两个犯人。吉姆就是那个犯人。好啦，我很高兴我们按侦探推理把事弄明白了，其他方法不名一文。现在你开动脑筋想个偷吉姆的办法，我也动脑筋想个办法，然后我们用那个最好的办法。\\n\\n 　　多棒啊，一个小孩儿脑子竟这么好使！如果我能有汤姆·索亚那样的脑子，叫我当公爵，或是做轮船大副，或是马戏团小丑，或者是我所能想起来的所有角色我都不换。我想出来了一个办法，但那只是应付一下，我很清楚好办法会打哪儿来。不一会儿，汤姆问：\"想好了？\"\"想好了。\" 我说。\\n\\n 　　\"那好，讲讲看。\"\"我的办法是这样，\"我说，\" 我们很容易搞明白是不是吉姆在那里。然后，明晚，把我的独木舟捞出来，再把我的木排从那个岛上划过来。等到一碰上漆黑的夜晚，那老头儿睡着之后，把钥匙从他裤兜里偷出来，然后尽快划开，乘木排从大河上顺流直下，带着吉姆，昼伏夜行，像我和吉姆以前的做法一样。这个办法行得通吗？\"\"（行得通）？\"当然啦，它行得通，像老鼠打架。可这太他妈的简单了，象杯白开水。一个不费劲的主意有什么用？真乏味。喂，哈克，这就像闯进肥皂厂偷肥皂一样，人家不会把它当回事儿来谈呀。\"我一句话不说，因为这正如我所料，不过我十分清楚，一旦他的主意拿定，那就不会有什么异议。\\n\\n 　　果然不错。他告诉我他的办法，我马上就看到这比我的办法强15 倍，很有派头，它像我的主意一样能让吉姆成为自由人，但是，它也可能把我们几人的命全搭进去。因此我满意了，说我们得尽快行动。现在，我不必说出来这主意如何，因为我知道它不会一成不变。我知道，随着我们向下进展，他会随意更改，一碰到机会，他就会添进去新花样。他后来就是这样干的。不过，有一点是确凿无疑的：那就是，汤姆·索亚诚心诚意，当真打算要偷出那个黑奴，帮他摆脱奴隶生活，这一点让我想不通。像他这样受人尊敬、教养良好的男孩子，做坏事会降低身份的，他家的人全都很有身份；他聪明伶俐，脑子也不笨，他有知识有见识，头脑并不简单；他不卑鄙下作，而是心地良善；可他现在完全不顾脸面，不问是非，不顾人情世故，却要屈尊低就干这事儿，在大家面前让他自己丢人，叫他家里人跟着丢脸。这我想不通，根本没办法想通。这简直荒诞至极，我知道我应该直截了当地告诉他这些话，这样才够得上是他的真正朋友，让他立即撒手这件事，以挽救他自己。后来，我真的开口劝他了，可是他叫我闭嘴，他说：\"你难道看不出我很明白自己在干什么吗？我以往做事，是不是一向头脑清楚呢？\"\"是呀。\"\"我不是已经（说过了）我要帮你偷那个黑人吗？\"\"是呀。\"\"那好，别再往下说了。\"他的话到此为止，我也就讲了这么多。再说多了也没用，因为他但凡说要做一件事，他总会做成。但是我就是开不清楚他怎么会乐意搅和到这种事情里头，所以我就随它去，不再费心。如果他执意如此，我可拦不住。\\n\\n 　　我们到家时，房子全黑了，静悄情的，因此我们一直往浸灰桶旁边的那间小屋走去，想摸摸情况。我们从院中穿过，想试试那些狗会怎么样。狗也认识我们，没叫几声，只不过像家狗那样夜里看到有人来，习惯性地那样汪汪两下而已。我们到了小屋旁，看看前面和两边，又看了看我不熟的那一面--是北面--我们看到一个四方形的窗口，离地很高，只横着钉了一条结实木板。我说：\"这就是出去的门票。这个窗口大得足够吉姆打里边钻出来了，我们撬掉那块板就可以。\"汤姆说：\"这办法简单得跟\u0027三连棋\u0027游戏一样，容易得像玩逃学。我（希望）的是我们能找到一个比（这个）复杂一些的办法，哈克·芬。\"\"那好吧，\"我说，\" 把木板锯掉让他出来如何？就像那一回我被人谋杀时用的办法一样。\"\"这倒还像个主意，\"他说，\" 确实神秘、麻烦而够味。\"他说：\" 不过我敢打赌我们可以找到个比这费劲一倍的办法。我们不着急，再往四周看看吧。\"在小屋和围墙之间，靠小屋后墙那一边，有一个拿木板做的斜顶棚子，跟小屋的屋檐连在一起。它与小屋一样长，可很窄，仅六英尺宽。它的门在南头，加着挂锁。汤姆到那个煮肥皂的锅旁边，找了一圈儿，带回来一个揭锅盖用的铁家伙，他拿它撬掉一个锁环。铁锁落地，我们打开门进去，又随手关上门，划着一根火柴，看见这个棚只是靠着小屋搭建的，并不相通，里边也没有地板，只有一些生锈的废旧锄头、铁锨、镐和一把用坏的犁。火柴灭了，我们也出来了，又将锁给按上，门锁得像先前一样。汤姆很兴奋地说：\"这回我们好办了。我们得把他（挖）出来。这得花上大约一个星期！\"然后我们大大房中去，我从后门进--你只需拉开门闩，他们并未把门上死--可这对汤姆·索亚不够神奇，他非得去顺着避雷针往上爬不可。但是，他每回都爬到半路就爬不动了，每次都摔到地上，最后一次，差点把他的脑浆摔出来，他只得放弃，但是歇了一会儿，他认为他还要再爬一次，就当是试运气，这一次他爬上去了。\\n\\n 　　第二天拂晓时分，我们起床，跑到黑人住的小屋与那些狗亲热一番，又和给吉姆送饭的那个黑人套套近乎--我们其实并不知道送去的饭（是不是）给吉姆吃的。那些黑人刚吃完早饭准备下地，负责吉姆的黑人正朝一个铁锅里放面包、肉和别的东西，其他人出去时，钥匙打正房送了过来。\\n\\n 　　这黑人从长相上看脾气很好，又傻头傻脑，他的头发全用线扎成小绺，这样做是为了避邪。他说老妖魔这些夜里死死缠着他，叫他看到各种各样稀奇古怪的影子，听见各种各样稀奇古怪的话和声音，他相信他这辈子还从未被纠缠这么久。他给弄得精神紧张，四处乱跑，老想着自己得遭灾遇难，总会把刚打算好要干的事情全给忘了。于是汤姆问：\"这些吃的东西干嘛用的？拿去喂狗吗？\"那黑人的脸上慢慢笑开了，如同你在一块烂泥地里扔一块碎砖头差不多。他说：\"是啊，席德少爷，是一条狗，还是条稀罕狗。您想去看看他吗？\"\"想啊。\"我推推汤姆，小声说：\"你想在这天色大亮的时候去吗？（这样）可不是我们的原定计划。\"\"对呀，不是原定计划，可这是我人的（现行）计划。\"真见鬼，我们就一起去了，可我不大乐意这么做。我们进去时，简直什么也看不到，里面很黑，但吉姆在那里，没错，他能看到我们。他喊了出来：\"嘿，哈克！哎呀，天哪，这不是汤姆少爷吗？\"我就料到会这样，果然猜对了。（我）可不明白怎么办，我即便知道，也来不及了，因为那个黑人嘴说：\"噢，天哪！他认识您两位？\"这时，我们可以看得很清楚了。汤姆看看那个黑人，稳稳当当却略带惊诧地说：\"你说（谁）认识我们？\"\"呃，这个逃跑黑人呀。\"\"我看他并不认识我们，可你脑子里竟然会产生这个想法。\"\"怎么产生的？他不是刚喊了你们的名字？\"汤姆有些莫名其妙地说：\"好么，那就太奇怪了。（谁）喊了？他（什么时候）喊了？他喊（什么）了？\"说完他转向我，非常镇定地问：\" 你听（到）有人喊吗？\"当然除了撒谎我啥也不能说，于是我答：\"没有，（我）可没听到谁说什么。\"然后他转向吉姆，细细打量他一番，好像以前从未见过他，问道：\"你刚才喊了吗？\"\"没，您哪，\"吉姆说，\" 我可啥都没说，您哪。\"\"一个字没讲？\"\"没有，您哪，我一个字也没讲。\"\"你过去见过我们吗？\"\"没有，您哪，我可不记得我见过。\"因此，汤姆这才转向那黑人，这阵，黑人脸上带着发狂而又沮丧的表情，汤姆口吻严厉地说：\"你这事究竟怎么解释？你怎么会想到有人喊话呢？\"\"噢，这肯定是那该死的妖魔做怪，您哪，我真恨不得死掉算了，我真这样想。它们老缠着我，您哪，我快被折磨死了，他们把我吓成这样子。请您对谁也别提这事儿，赛拉斯老主人会骂我的，因为他说压根儿没有妖魔。我真希望他这阵儿在场，那么看他还有什么可说！这回我敢说他没法子不信了。不过世上的事儿就这样，犟脾气的人就是犟，他们自己不调查，不搞搞清楚，当（你）搞清楚了跟他们说，他们又不相信你。\"汤姆给了他一毛钱，又说他不会告诉别人，叫他再买些线扎起他的头发，然后看看吉姆说道：\"我不知道赛拉斯姨父会不会绞死这个黑人。如果我抓住一个忘恩负义到逃走的黑人，我可不会饶了他，我会绞死他。\"那个黑人走到门口，看看那一毛硬币，又拿牙咬咬，看是不是真的，趁这个机会，汤姆对吉姆耳语道：\"千万别露出来你认识我们。要是你晚上听到有人挖洞，那就是我们，我们想救你出去。\"吉姆刚抓住我们的手捏了捏，那黑人回来了，我们说过些日子我们还会再来，如果那黑人愿意的话，他说他愿意，特别是天黑的时候，因为那些巫婆大半在黑地方缠他，那时身边有人会有不少好处。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/71/3914.html","bookId":546,"book":{"id":546,"title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn哈克贝里·芬历险记","description":"简介： Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a book by Mark Twain, first published in England in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885.
