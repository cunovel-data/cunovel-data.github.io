{"id":41899,"no":42,"title":"Chapter 42","content":"THE old man was uptown again before breakfast, but couldn\u0027t get no track of Tom; and both of them set at the table thinking, and not saying nothing, and looking mournful, and their coffee getting cold, and not eating anything. And by and by the old man says: \n \"Did I give you the letter?\" \n \"What letter?\" \n \"The one I got yesterday out of the post-office.\" \n \"No, you didn\u0027t give me no letter.\" \n \"Well, I must a forgot it.\" \n So he rummaged his pockets, and then went off somewheres where he had laid it down, and fetched it, and give it to her. She says: \n \"Why, it\u0027s from St. Petersburg -- it\u0027s from Sis.\" \n I allowed another walk would do me good; but I couldn\u0027t stir. But before she could break it open she dropped it and run -- for she see something. And so did I. It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress; and that old doctor; and Jim, in HER calico dress, with his hands tied behind him; and a lot of people. I hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy, and rushed. She flung herself at Tom, crying, and says: \n \"Oh, he\u0027s dead, he\u0027s dead, I know he\u0027s dead!\" \n And Tom he turned his head a little, and muttered something or other, which showed he warn\u0027t in his right mind; then she flung up her hands, and says: \n \"He\u0027s alive, thank God! And that\u0027s enough!\" and she snatched a kiss of him, and flew for the house to get the bed ready, and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody else, as fast as her tongue could go, every jump of the way. \n I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim; and the old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house. The men was very huffy, and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all the other niggers around there, so they wouldn\u0027t be trying to run away like Jim done, and making such a raft of trouble, and keeping a whole family scared most to death for days and nights. But the others said, don\u0027t do it, it wouldn\u0027t answer at all; he ain\u0027t our nigger, and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him, sure. So that cooled them down a little, because the people that\u0027s always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hain\u0027t done just right is always the very ones that ain\u0027t the most anxious to pay for him when they\u0027ve got their satisfaction out of him. \n They cussed Jim considerble, though, and give him a cuff or two side the head once in a while, but Jim never said nothing, and he never let on to know me, and they took him to the same cabin, and put his own clothes on him, and chained him again, and not to no bed-leg this time, but to a big staple drove into the bottom log, and chained his hands, too, and both legs, and said he warn\u0027t to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come, or he was sold at auction because he didn\u0027t come in a certain length of time, and filled up our hole, and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night, and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime; and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl good-bye cussing, and then the old doctor comes and takes a look, and says: \n \"Don\u0027t be no rougher on him than you\u0027re obleeged to, because he ain\u0027t a bad nigger. When I got to where I found the boy I see I couldn\u0027t cut the bullet out without some help, and he warn\u0027t in no condition for me to leave to go and get help; and he got a little worse and a little worse, and after a long time he went out of his head, and wouldn\u0027t let me come a-nigh him any more, and said if I chalked his raft he\u0027d kill me, and no end of wild foolishness like that, and I see I couldn\u0027t do anything at all with him; so I says, I got to have HELP somehow; and the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he\u0027ll help, and he done it, too, and done it very well. Of course I judged he must be a runaway nigger, and there I WAS! and there I had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night. It was a fix, I tell you! I had a couple of patients with the chills, and of course I\u0027d of liked to run up to town and see them, but I dasn\u0027t, because the nigger might get away, and then I\u0027d be to blame; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail. So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this morning; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller, and yet he was risking his freedom to do it, and was all tired out, too, and I see plain enough he\u0027d been worked main hard lately. I liked the nigger for that; I tell you, gentlemen, a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars -- and kind treatment, too. I had everything I needed, and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home -- better, maybe, because it was so quiet; but there I WAS, with both of \u0027m on my hands, and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning; then some men in a skiff come by, and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep; so I motioned them in quiet, and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about, and we never had no trouble. And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep, too, we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on, and towed her over very nice and quiet, and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start. He ain\u0027t no bad nigger, gentlemen; that\u0027s what I think about him.\" \n Somebody says: \n \"Well, it sounds very good, doctor, I\u0027m obleeged to say.\" \n Then the others softened up a little, too, and I was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn; and I was glad it was according to my judgment of him, too; because I thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him. Then they all agreed that Jim had acted very well, and was deserving to have some notice took of it, and reward. So every one of them promised, right out and hearty, that they wouldn\u0027t cuss him no more. \n Then they come out and locked him up. I hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off, because they was rotten heavy, or could have meat and greens with his bread and water; but they didn\u0027t think of it, and I reckoned it warn\u0027t best for me to mix in, but I judged I\u0027d get the doctor\u0027s yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as I\u0027d got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me -- explanations, I mean, of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger. \n But I had plenty time. Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day and all night, and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged him. \n Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better, and they said Aunt Sally was gone to get a nap. So I slips to the sick-room, and if I found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash. But he was sleeping, and sleeping very peaceful, too; and pale, not fire-faced the way he was when he come. So I set down and laid for him to wake. In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in, and there I was, up a stump again! She motioned me to be still, and set down by me, and begun to whisper, and said we could all be joyful now, because all the symptoms was first-rate, and he\u0027d been sleeping like that for ever so long, and looking better and peacefuller all the time, and ten to one he\u0027d wake up in his right mind. \n So we set there watching, and by and by he stirs a bit, and opened his eyes very natural, and takes a look, and says: \n \"Hello! -- why, I\u0027m at HOME! How\u0027s that? Where\u0027s the raft?\" \n \"It\u0027s all right,\" I says. \n \"And JIM?\" \n \"The same,\" I says, but couldn\u0027t say it pretty brash. But he never noticed, but says: \n \"Good! Splendid! NOW we\u0027re all right and safe! Did you tell Aunty?\" \n I was going to say yes; but she chipped in and says: \"About what, Sid?\" \n \"Why, about the way the whole thing was done.\" \n \"What whole thing?\" \n \"Why, THE whole thing. There ain\u0027t but one; how we set the runaway nigger free -- me and Tom.\" \n \"Good land! Set the run -- What IS the child talking about! Dear, dear, out of his head again!\" \n \"NO, I ain\u0027t out of my HEAD; I know all what I\u0027m talking about. We DID set him free -- me and Tom. We laid out to do it, and we DONE it. And we done it elegant, too.\" He\u0027d got a start, and she never checked him up, just set and stared and stared, and let him clip along, and I see it warn\u0027t no use for ME to put in. \"Why, Aunty, it cost us a power of work -- weeks of it -- hours and hours, every night, whilst you was all asleep. And we had to steal candles, and the sheet, and the shirt, and your dress, and spoons, and tin plates, and case-knives, and the warming-pan, and the grindstone, and flour, and just no end of things, and you can\u0027t think what work it was to make the saws, and pens, and inscriptions, and one thing or another, and you can\u0027t think HALF the fun it was. And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things, and nonnamous letters from the robbers, and get up and down the lightning-rod, and dig the hole into the cabin, and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie, and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket --\" \n \"Mercy sakes!\" \n \"-- and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on, for company for Jim; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business, because the men come before we was out of the cabin, and we had to rush, and they heard us and let drive at us, and I got my share, and we dodged out of the path and let them go by, and when the dogs come they warn\u0027t interested in us, but went for the most noise, and we got our canoe, and made for the raft, and was all safe, and Jim was a free man, and we done it all by ourselves, and WASN\u0027T it bully, Aunty!\" \n \"Well, I never heard the likes of it in all my born days! So it was YOU, you little rapscallions, that\u0027s been making all this trouble, and turned everybody\u0027s wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death. I\u0027ve as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o\u0027 you this very minute. To think, here I\u0027ve been, night after night, a -- YOU just get well once, you young scamp, and I lay I\u0027ll tan the Old Harry out o\u0027 both o\u0027 ye!\" \n But Tom, he WAS so proud and joyful, he just COULDN\u0027T hold in, and his tongue just WENT it -- she a-chipping in, and spitting fire all along, and both of them going it at once, like a cat convention; and she says: \n \"WELL, you get all the enjoyment you can out of it NOW, for mind I tell you if I catch you meddling with him again --\" \n \"Meddling with WHO?\" Tom says, dropping his smile and looking surprised. \n \"With WHO? Why, the runaway nigger, of course. Who\u0027d you reckon?\" \n Tom looks at me very grave, and says: \n \"Tom, didn\u0027t you just tell me he was all right? Hasn\u0027t he got away?\" \n \"HIM?\" says Aunt Sally; \"the runaway nigger? \u0027Deed he hasn\u0027t. They\u0027ve got him back, safe and sound, and he\u0027s in that cabin again, on bread and water, and loaded down with chains, till he\u0027s claimed or sold!\" \n Tom rose square up in bed, with his eye hot, and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills, and sings out to me: \n \"They hain\u0027t no RIGHT to shut him up! SHOVE! -- and don\u0027t you lose a minute. Turn him loose! he ain\u0027t no slave; he\u0027s as free as any cretur that walks this earth!\" \n \"What DOES the child mean?\" \n \"I mean every word I SAY, Aunt Sally, and if somebody don\u0027t go, I\u0027LL go. I\u0027ve knowed him all his life, and so has Tom, there. Old Miss Watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river, and SAID so; and she set him free in her will.\" \n \"Then what on earth did YOU want to set him free for, seeing he was already free?\" \n \"Well, that IS a question, I must say; and just like women! Why, I wanted the ADVENTURE of it; and I\u0027d a waded neck-deep in blood to -- goodness alive, AUNT POLLY!\" \n If she warn\u0027t standing right there, just inside the door, looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, I wish I may never! \n Aunt Sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and cried over her, and I found a good enough place for me under the bed, for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me. And I peeped out, and in a little while Tom\u0027s Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles -- kind of grinding him into the earth, you know. And then she says: \n \"Yes, you BETTER turn y\u0027r head away -- I would if I was you, Tom.\" \n \"Oh, deary me!\" says Aunt Sally; \"IS he changed so? Why, that ain\u0027t TOM, it\u0027s Sid; Tom\u0027s -- Tom\u0027s -- why, where is Tom? He was here a minute ago.\" \n \"You mean where\u0027s Huck FINN -- that\u0027s what you mean! I reckon I hain\u0027t raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I SEE him. That WOULD be a pretty howdy-do. Come out from under that bed, Huck Finn.\" \n So I done it. But not feeling brash. \n Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever see -- except one, and that was Uncle Silas, when he come in and they told it all to him. It kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn\u0027t know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the oldest man in the world couldn\u0027t a understood it. So Tom\u0027s Aunt Polly, she told all about who I was, and what; and I had to up and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer -- she chipped in and says, \"Oh, go on and call me Aunt Sally, I\u0027m used to it now, and \u0027tain\u0027t no need to change\" -- that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it -- there warn\u0027t no other way, and I knowed he wouldn\u0027t mind, because it would be nuts for him, being a mystery, and he\u0027d make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly satisfied. And so it turned out, and he let on to be Sid, and made things as soft as he could for me. \n And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting Jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, Tom Sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and I couldn\u0027t ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he COULD help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up. \n Well, Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and SID had come all right and safe, she says to herself: \n \"Look at that, now! I might have expected it, letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him. So now I got to go and trapse all the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that creetur\u0027s up to THIS time, as long as I couldn\u0027t seem to get any answer out of you about it.\" \n \"Why, I never heard nothing from you,\" says Aunt Sally. \n \"Well, I wonder! Why, I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by Sid being here.\" \n \"Well, I never got \u0027em, Sis.\" \n Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe, and says: \n \"You, Tom!\" \n \"Well -- WHAT?\" he says, kind of pettish. \n \"Don t you what ME, you impudent thing -- hand out them letters.\" \n \"What letters?\" \n \"THEM letters. I be bound, if I have to take aholt of you I\u0027ll --\" \n \"They\u0027re in the trunk. There, now. And they\u0027re just the same as they was when I got them out of the office. I hain\u0027t looked into them, I hain\u0027t touched them. But I knowed they\u0027d make trouble, and I thought if you warn\u0027t in no hurry, I\u0027d --\" \n \"Well, you DO need skinning, there ain\u0027t no mistake about it. And I wrote another one to tell you I was coming; and I s\u0027pose he --\" \n \"No, it come yesterday; I hain\u0027t read it yet, but IT\u0027S all right, I\u0027ve got that one.\" \n I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she hadn\u0027t, but I reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to. So I never said nothing. \n 　　我跟着那些人，看看他们要怎么处置吉姆，老大夫和赛拉斯姨父跟在汤姆后边进了屋，那些人全气鼓鼓的，有的想绞死吉姆，让这一带其他所有的黑人看看，以儆效尤，这样他们就不敢再像吉姆那么逃跑了。，还惹出这么多麻烦，一连几天几夜把一大家人吓得半死。另一些说不能这么做，道理上根本讲不通，他不是我们的黑人，他的主人一定会出面，叫我们赔他。这么一来，他们的势头给压下去一点儿，因为那些最急于要绞死干坏事儿的黑人的人，也总是那些拿黑人解恨以后最不愿出钱赔偿的人。\n 　　不过，他们还是狠骂他，还时不时地抽他耳光。可吉姆一句话也不说，也不显出他认识我。他们又将他关进原来那间小屋，换上他自己的衣服，用链子锁上，这次可不是锁到床腿上了，而是锁在墙根儿底下那根木头的一个大U 形钉上，还给他加了脚镣手铐。说从现在起到他主人来或者他被拍卖掉这一段日子内，由于他的主人没个准时间来，除了面包跟水啥也不给他吃；把我们的洞也堵上了，说每晚得派两个农夫持枪在小屋四周看守放哨，白天在门口拴条斗牛狗。到这时候，他们才算把这事安排妥当，临走前又一阵臭骂，这时，老大夫进来了，他看了一下说：\"能不对他狠就不要对他狠吧，因为他是个心眼很好的黑人。我找到那孩子时，没人帮忙我取不出那颗子弹，看他的伤势我又不能离开他去喊人帮忙。他的情况日益糟糕，时间一长，他神志不清了，再不让我靠近他，说如果我在他木排上画粉笔印儿，他就会杀了我，尽说这类没头没脑的蠢话，我看我一个人对他一点办法儿也没有了，我就说，不管怎样，我都得找人帮忙。话刚说完，这个黑人就不知打哪儿爬了出来，说他可以帮忙，他就帮了我，干得还相当好。当然啦，我判断他肯定是个逃跑的黑人，我无法可想！只得一直守在那儿，守了那老半天，还有一整夜。那可真为难，我告诉你们！我有两个病人发疟疾，我当然想去镇上去看他们，可我不敢，因为这个黑人或许会逃走，那样我就会受责怪，可是附近又没一个小船能听得见我呼叫。我就只好呆在那儿，一直呆到天亮。我可没见过有哪一个黑人对病人护理得那么好，又那么忠心耿耿，可他这样做时，是冒着失去自由的危险，并且他也早已经是精疲力尽了，我看得很清楚，近来，一定是有人让他干了不少重活儿。因为这些，我喜欢这个黑人。我跟你们说，先生们，像这样的黑人值一千块--并且得好好地待他。我叫他做的事情他都做到了，这孩子在那儿跟在家里照料得一样好，也许比在家还好，因为那儿很清静。不过我很作难，两个人我都得守着，我就只得呆在那儿，等到今天天亮。这时，有几个人坐船经过，运气还不错，这个黑人坐在草铺边上，头垂在腿当中睡得相当熟，于是我招呼他们轻轻地上来，没给他反应的时间，他们就扑到他身上，抓住他，把他捆了起来，我们没费一点劲儿。这个孩子正昏昏沉沉地睡着，我们拿东西裹住船桨，拴上木排，稳当当静悄悄地把它拖过河来，这个黑人打一开头就没嚷一声，也没说一句话。他真不坏，先生们，我对他就是这样的看法。\"有人说：\"啊，听起来你说得很对，大夫，我不否认。\"其他人也有些缓和了，我十分感激那个老大夫为吉姆说了这么多好话，我也很高兴我没把吉姆看错，因为我头一回看见他，就觉得他有一副好心肠。后来，他们全认为吉姆做事很好，让大家看得起，值得褒奖。于是，每个人都立刻真心诚意地表态，不再骂他了。\n 　　然后他们出去，把他锁在小屋里。我希望他们会说能给他去掉一两根锁链，因为它们实在太重了，或者除了面包和水还能给他吃肉和青菜。可他们都想不到这类事，我想我还是不插嘴为妙，不过我想，等我过去眼前这一关，我就要想办法把大夫说的事情讲给莎丽姨听。我是说，起初我向她解释我和席德那天晚上划船到处寻找这个逃跑黑人时，怎么会忘了提他受伤这件事。\n 　　不过，我有的是时间。莎丽姨整日整夜守在病房里，每次碰到赛拉斯姨父闲逛，我就躲开。\n 　　第二天早上，我听说汤姆好多了。他们说莎丽姨出去了要稍睡会儿。于是我悄悄走入病房，要是赶上他醒着，我想我们就能编出一些事儿哄过这一家人。可他正在睡觉，还睡得很平和，面色苍白，不像来时那样脸烧得通红。我就坐下来等着他醒。等了半个小时，莎丽姨蹑手蹑脚走了进来，没有办法，我又被困住了！她摆摆手叫我别动，小声说起话来，说现在我们都可以高兴了，因为各种症候都很好，他这么着已经睡着好久了，气色一直越来越好，越来越平和，十有八九他醒来时脑子会好过来。\n 　　因此，我们坐在那儿注视着，过了一阵，他稍稍动了一下，很自然地睁开眼睛，看了看说：\"嗨，怎么我是在家里呀！这怎么回事？木排在哪儿？\"\"全好好的。\" 我说。\n 　　\"吉姆呢？\"\"还是老样。\" 我说，不过不能说得太急促。可他一点儿没在意，而是说：\"太好啦！棒极啦！这样我们就平安无事啦！你给姨说过了？\"我刚想说是，可她插嘴说：\"说过什么了，席德？\"\"咦，说整个事情是如何做的呀。\"\"什么整个事情？\"\"哎呀，就是这整个事儿啦。就有这么一个事儿，我们是怎么把那个逃跑黑人放走的--我和汤姆。\"\"天哪！放那个逃--这孩子，这是说的哪里话！哎呀呀，他脑子又乱啦！\"\"不，我的脑子没乱，我说的事情我全清楚。我们确实放了他--我跟汤姆。我们计划着要干，我们也真干了。干得还很漂亮。\" 他开了头，她也就不拦他，光是坐在那儿拿眼睛一个劲儿地瞪着他，听他滔滔不绝朝下说。我知道我插嘴也没用。\"姨呀，它可费了我们老劲啦--好几个星期呀--每个晚上在你们都睡着的时候，我们就一个小时接一个小时地干。我们还得偷蜡烛、床单、衬衣、您的衣服、匙子、铁盘子、餐刀、取暖盆、滚磨石、面粉，许许多多的东西，您想像不到做锯、做笔、题字等等，等等，都费了很多气力，您连它一半的乐趣都难以想象得到。我们还得画那些棺材之类的画儿，编造强盗匿名信，顺避雷针爬上爬下，还得往那个小屋里挖洞，做绳梯子，把它烙进一张饼里给送进去，还得送匙子以及其他干活儿用的工具，就放在您的围裙口袋里让您给带去。\"\"天哪！\"\"还把小屋里放满老鼠、蛇等等，想让它们和吉姆做伴儿；后来，您把汤姆扣在这儿那么长时间，他的帽子里一直戴着那块黄油，您险些把整个事情搅坏，因为那些人还没等我们离开小屋就进去了，我们只得赶快跑，他们听见动静就死劲追我们，我挨了枪，我们躲开小路让他们过去，当狗跑来时，它们对我们不感兴趣，向最热闹的地方跑去了，我们就跳上独木舟，找到木排，全安全了，吉姆也成了自由人，这全是我们自己干的，您说棒不棒，姨！\"\"好啊，打我生下来那天起还没听过这事呢！原来是你们，你们这两个坏小子，弄出来这么多麻烦，搞得人人晕头转向，吓得我们大家险些死掉。我这会儿真恨不得狠狠揍你们一顿。想想看，我在这儿守了一夜又一夜，啊--你就赶快好吧，你这个小调皮鬼，我非得把你们这两个调皮鬼的魂儿给揍出来不可！\"可汤姆呢，他简直是得意洋洋，兴高采烈，他简直憋不住，他顺顾自个儿往下说，她是一个劲儿插话，唾沫星儿乱溅，两个人总是同时抢着说话，活猫打架。她说：\"好啦，你干这事儿总痛快够了吧，我告诉你，当心吧，如果我抓住你们再管他的闲事..\"\"和谁的闲事？\"汤姆问，笑脸拉下来了，表情十分吃惊。\"管谁？嘿，就是那个逃跑黑人呀。你以为会是谁？\"汤姆十分严肃地看着我，说：\"汤姆，你不是刚对我说他还好好的吗？他没逃掉？\"\"他？\"莎丽姨说，\" 那个逃跑黑人？他自然逃不掉。他们把他抓回来了，安然无恙，他又被关进那间小屋里了，吃面包喝白水，戴了脚镣手铐，等着人来领或者被卖掉！\"汤姆立即在床上坐直，双眼冒火，鼻孔一张一翕活像鱼鳃，他大声对我喊道：\"他们没权利关押他！快去！一分钟也别再耽搁。放了他！他不是奴隶了，他跟在这个地球上走路的所有人一样自由！\"\"这孩子到底是什么意思？\"\"我的话一点儿没错，莎丽姨，要是没人去，我就去。他这一辈子的事情我全知道，汤姆也知道。老华森小姐两个月前死了，她对自己十分打算把他卖到下游去感到十分惭愧，她亲口这么讲了，在遗嘱里她让他自由了。\"\"那你究竟为什么还要放他跑呢，既然你早知道他已自由了？\"\"啊，这倒真是个问题，我得承认。可这简直是妇人之见！我想要尝尝历险的滋味呀，我宁肯在齐脖子深的鲜血里嘡着走也要--哎呀，天哪，是波丽姨妈！\"那可不正是她嘛，端端正正地在门口站着，心满意足，安详甜美，看上去就像个天使，真叫人想不到！\n 　　莎丽姨跳上前去，把她的头都快搂掉了，又趴到她肩膀上大哭，我在床底下找了个很好的地方藏了起来，因为我好像觉得我们的处境正越来越窘。我偷眼往外瞧，过了一阵，汤姆的波丽姨妈自己挣开，站在那儿打眼镜上面朝汤姆这边看--几乎快要把他盯到地缝儿里去，你知道吧。后来她说：\"对，你最好把头别开--我如果是你，我就会这么做，汤姆。\"\"哎呀，怎么啦！\" 莎丽姨说，\" 他变得这样厉害吗？唉，这可不是汤姆是席德，汤姆在--汤姆在--咦，汤姆在哪儿？他一分钟前还在这里呢。\"\"你说的是哈克·芬在哪儿吧--你说的准是他！我看我把汤姆这个淘气鬼打小带大这么多年，总不至于见了面还认不出来吧。那可真成了好见面礼啦。打那个床底下出来吧，哈克·芬。\"因此我就出来了，可觉得不怎么好意思。\n 　　莎丽姨是我见过的表情最变幻莫测的一个人，除了她之外还有赛拉斯姨父，他进来时，她们把所有的全都告诉了他。这搞得他晕晕乎乎，你可以这么讲，后来那一整天，他什么也弄不明白，到了晚上他在祈祷会上讲道，可出了大名，因为就算是世界上年龄最大的人也听不懂。因此，汤姆的波丽姨妈给他们讲清楚了我是谁，是什么人；我也不得不承认当初斐尔普斯太太把我错认成汤姆·索亚时我有多紧张。她插嘴道：\" 啊，还叫我莎丽姨，我已经习惯了，你没有必要改口。\" 刚开始莎丽姨把我错认成汤姆·索亚时，我只能顺水推舟，没别的办法。我知道汤姆不会介意，因为这对他来说会是件很开心的事儿，是个秘密，他可以用它来历险，会玩个心满意足。结果也正是这样，他装作是席德，把局面应付得让我感到顺顺当当。波丽姨妈还说老华森小姐在她遗嘱里给吉姆自由了，汤姆的话是对的。原来是这样，真真切切，汤姆·索亚历尽艰辛，费尽苦心是在帮助一个自由黑人争取自由！过去我总在怀疑，像他这种有教养的人，怎么会帮助一个黑人争取自由，听了这会儿这话，我才理解了。\n 　　接下去，波丽阿姨说，当莎丽姨给她写信说汤姆还有席德全安全到达了，她心里想：\"看看这是怎么回事！我本来就该料到，让他一个人出门没人管着不行。于是我只好受累赶了一千一百英里水路过来，看看这个小家伙儿这一回又玩什么花招儿。因为我好像是收不到你们这方面的回信。\"\"咦，我根本就没收到过你的来信。\" 莎丽姨说。\n 　　\"这就奇怪啦！我给你写过两回信，都是问你席德在这里是什么意思。\"\"哎呀，我压根儿没收到过信，姐。\"波丽阿姨慢慢转过身子，严厉地说：\"又是你，汤姆！\"\"啊--什么呀？\"他有些撒娇地问。\n 　　\"别问我什么呀，你这个冒失鬼，把信拿出来。\"\"什么信呀？\"\"就那两封信。老实告诉你，如果非得让我抓住你不可，那可就..\"\"信在箱子里。行了吧。它们和我从邮局取出来时一样，全原封未动。我没打开看，我也没碰。只是我知道它们会带来麻烦，我想要是你不着急，我就..\"\"好啊，你真是该剥皮，这一点儿已不冤枉你。我还写了一封信告诉你们我要来，我看他..\"\"没有，昨天到的，我还没看。不过这封信倒是好好的，我收到了。\"我想同她赌两块钱，说她没收到，可我估计最好还是不说为好。因此，我没吱声。\n
