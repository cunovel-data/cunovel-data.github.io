{"id":41886,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 29","content":"THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along, and a nice-looking younger one, with his right arm in a sling. And, my souls, how the people yelled and laughed, and kept it up. But I didn\u0027t see no joke about it, and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any. I reckoned they\u0027d turn pale. But no, nary a pale did THEY turn. The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up, but just went a goo-gooing around, happy and satisfied, like a jug that\u0027s googling out buttermilk; and as for the king, he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world. Oh, he done it admirable. Lots of the principal people gethered around the king, to let him see they was on his side. That old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death. Pretty soon he begun to speak, and I see straight off he pronounced LIKE an Englishman -- not the king\u0027s way, though the king\u0027s WAS pretty good for an imitation. I can\u0027t give the old gent\u0027s words, nor I can\u0027t imitate him; but he turned around to the crowd, and says, about like this: \n \"This is a surprise to me which I wasn\u0027t looking for; and I\u0027ll acknowledge, candid and frank, I ain\u0027t very well fixed to meet it and answer it; for my brother and me has had misfortunes; he\u0027s broke his arm, and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake. I am Peter Wilks\u0027 brother Harvey, and this is his brother William, which can\u0027t hear nor speak -- and can\u0027t even make signs to amount to much, now\u0027t he\u0027s only got one hand to work them with. We are who we say we are; and in a day or two, when I get the baggage, I can prove it. But up till then I won\u0027t say nothing more, but go to the hotel and wait.\" \n So him and the new dummy started off; and the king he laughs, and blethers out: \n \"Broke his arm -- VERY likely, AIN\u0027T it? -- and very convenient, too, for a fraud that\u0027s got to make signs, and ain\u0027t learnt how. Lost their baggage! That\u0027s MIGHTY good! -- and mighty ingenious -- under the CIRCUMSTANCES! \n So he laughed again; and so did everybody else, except three or four, or maybe half a dozen. One of these was that doctor; another one was a sharplooking gentleman, with a carpet-bag of the oldfashioned kind made out of carpet-stuff, that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice, and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their heads -- it was Levi Bell, the lawyer that was gone up to Louisville; and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said, and was listening to the king now. And when the king got done this husky up and says: \n \"Say, looky here; if you are Harvey Wilks, when\u0027d you come to this town?\" \n \"The day before the funeral, friend,\" says the king. \n \"But what time o\u0027 day?\" \n \"In the evenin\u0027 -- \u0027bout an hour er two before sundown.\" \n \"HOW\u0027D you come?\" \n \"I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati.\" \n \"Well, then, how\u0027d you come to be up at the Pint in the MORNIN\u0027 -- in a canoe?\" \n \"I warn\u0027t up at the Pint in the mornin\u0027.\" \n \"It\u0027s a lie.\" \n Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher. \n \"Preacher be hanged, he\u0027s a fraud and a liar. He was up at the Pint that mornin\u0027. I live up there, don\u0027t I? Well, I was up there, and he was up there. I see him there. He come in a canoe, along with Tim Collins and a boy.\" \n The doctor he up and says: \n \"Would you know the boy again if you was to see him, Hines?\" \n \"I reckon I would, but I don\u0027t know. Why, yonder he is, now. I know him perfectly easy.\" \n It was me he pointed at. The doctor says: \n \"Neighbors, I don\u0027t know whether the new couple is frauds or not; but if THESE two ain\u0027t frauds, I am an idiot, that\u0027s all. I think it\u0027s our duty to see that they don\u0027t get away from here till we\u0027ve looked into this thing. Come along, Hines; come along, the rest of you. We\u0027ll take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t\u0027other couple, and I reckon we\u0027ll find out SOMETHING before we get through.\" \n It was nuts for the crowd, though maybe not for the king\u0027s friends; so we all started. It was about sundown. The doctor he led me along by the hand, and was plenty kind enough, but he never let go my hand. \n We all got in a big room in the hotel, and lit up some candles, and fetched in the new couple. First, the doctor says: \n \"I don\u0027t wish to be too hard on these two men, but I think they\u0027re frauds, and they may have complices that we don\u0027t know nothing about. If they have, won\u0027t the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter Wilks left? It ain\u0027t unlikely. If these men ain\u0027t frauds, they won\u0027t object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they\u0027re all right -- ain\u0027t that so?\" \n Everybody agreed to that. So I judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart. But the king he only looked sorrowful, and says: \n \"Gentlemen, I wish the money was there, for I ain\u0027t got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair, open, out-and-out investigation o\u0027 this misable business; but, alas, the money ain\u0027t there; you k\u0027n send and see, if you want to.\" \n \"Where is it, then?\" \n \"Well, when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it inside o\u0027 the straw tick o\u0027 my bed, not wishin\u0027 to bank it for the few days we\u0027d be here, and considerin\u0027 the bed a safe place, we not bein\u0027 used to niggers, and suppos\u0027n\u0027 \u0027em honest, like servants in England. The niggers stole it the very next mornin\u0027 after I had went down stairs; and when I sold \u0027em I hadn\u0027t missed the money yit, so they got clean away with it. My servant here k\u0027n tell you \u0027bout it, gentlemen.\" \n The doctor and several said \"Shucks!\" and I see nobody didn\u0027t altogether believe him. One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it. I said no, but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away, and I never thought nothing, only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them. That was all they asked me. Then the doctor whirls on me and says: \n \"Are YOU English, too?\" \n I says yes; and him and some others laughed, and said, \"Stuff!\" \n Well, then they sailed in on the general investigation, and there we had it, up and down, hour in, hour out, and nobody never said a word about supper, nor ever seemed to think about it -- and so they kept it up, and kept it up; and it WAS the worst mixed-up thing you ever see. They made the king tell his yarn, and they made the old gentleman tell his\u0027n; and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a SEEN that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t\u0027other one lies. And by and by they had me up to tell what I knowed. The king he give me a left-handed look out of the corner of his eye, and so I knowed enough to talk on the right side. I begun to tell about Sheffield, and how we lived there, and all about the English Wilkses, and so on; but I didn\u0027t get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh; and Levi Bell, the lawyer, says: \n \"Set down, my boy; I wouldn\u0027t strain myself if I was you. I reckon you ain\u0027t used to lying, it don\u0027t seem to come handy; what you want is practice. You do it pretty awkward.\" \n I didn\u0027t care nothing for the compliment, but I was glad to be let off, anyway. \n The doctor he started to say something, and turns and says: \n \"If you\u0027d been in town at first, Levi Bell -- \" The king broke in and reached out his hand, and says: \n \"Why, is this my poor dead brother\u0027s old friend that he\u0027s wrote so often about?\" \n The lawyer and him shook hands, and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased, and they talked right along awhile, and then got to one side and talked low; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says: \n \"That \u0027ll fix it. I\u0027ll take the order and send it, along with your brother\u0027s, and then they\u0027ll know it\u0027s all right.\" \n So they got some paper and a pen, and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side, and chawed his tongue, and scrawled off something; and then they give the pen to the duke -- and then for the first time the duke looked sick. But he took the pen and wrote. So then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says: \n \"You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names.\" \n The old gentleman wrote, but nobody couldn\u0027t read it. The lawyer looked powerful astonished, and says: \n \"Well, it beats ME -- and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket, and examined them, and then examined the old man\u0027s writing, and then THEM again; and then says: \"These old letters is from Harvey Wilks; and here\u0027s THESE two handwritings, and anybody can see they didn\u0027t write them\" (the king and the duke looked sold and foolish, I tell you, to see how the lawyer had took them in), \"and here\u0027s THIS old gentleman\u0027s hand writing, and anybody can tell, easy enough, HE didn\u0027t write them -- fact is, the scratches he makes ain\u0027t properly WRITING at all. Now, here\u0027s some letters from --\" \n The new old gentleman says: \n \"If you please, let me explain. Nobody can read my hand but my brother there -- so he copies for me. It\u0027s HIS hand you\u0027ve got there, not mine.\" \n \"WELL!\" says the lawyer, \"this IS a state of things. I\u0027ve got some of William\u0027s letters, too; so if you\u0027ll get him to write a line or so we can com --\" \n \"He CAN\u0027T write with his left hand,\" says the old gentleman. \"If he could use his right hand, you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too. Look at both, please -- they\u0027re by the same hand.\" \n The lawyer done it, and says: \n \"I believe it\u0027s so -- and if it ain\u0027t so, there\u0027s a heap stronger resemblance than I\u0027d noticed before, anyway. Well, well, well! I thought we was right on the track of a slution, but it\u0027s gone to grass, partly. But anyway, one thing is proved -- THESE two ain\u0027t either of \u0027em Wilkses\" -- and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke. \n Well, what do you think? That muleheaded old fool wouldn\u0027t give in THEN! Indeed he wouldn\u0027t. Said it warn\u0027t no fair test. Said his brother William was the cussedest joker in the world, and hadn\u0027t tried to write -- HE see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper. And so he warmed up and went warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying HIM- SELF; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in, and says: \n \"I\u0027ve thought of something. Is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br -- helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying?\" \n \"Yes,\" says somebody, \"me and Ab Turner done it. We\u0027re both here.\" \n Then the old man turns towards the king, and says: \n \"Peraps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast?\" \n Blamed if the king didn\u0027t have to brace up mighty quick, or he\u0027d a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under, it took him so sudden; and, mind you, it was a thing that was calculated to make most ANYBODY sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice, because how was HE going to know what was tattooed on the man? He whitened a little; he couldn\u0027t help it; and it was mighty still in there, and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him. Says I to myself, NOW he\u0027ll throw up the sponge -- there ain\u0027t no more use. Well, did he? A body can\u0027t hardly believe it, but he didn\u0027t. I reckon he thought he\u0027d keep the thing up till he tired them people out, so they\u0027d thin out, and him and the duke could break loose and get away. Anyway, he set there, and pretty soon he begun to smile, and says: \n \"Mf! It\u0027s a VERY tough question, AIN\u0027T it! YES, sir, I k\u0027n tell you what\u0027s tattooed on his breast. It\u0027s jest a small, thin, blue arrow -- that\u0027s what it is; and if you don\u0027t look clost, you can\u0027t see it. NOW what do you say -- hey?\" \n Well, I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out cheek. \n The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard, and his eye lights up like he judged he\u0027d got the king THIS time, and says: \n \"There -- you\u0027ve heard what he said! Was there any such mark on Peter Wilks\u0027 breast?\" \n Both of them spoke up and says: \n \"We didn\u0027t see no such mark.\" \n \"Good!\" says the old gentleman. \"Now, what you DID see on his breast was a small dim P, and a B (which is an initial he dropped when he was young), and a W, with dashes between them, so: P -- B -- W\" -- and he marked them that way on a piece of paper. \"Come, ain\u0027t that what you saw?\" \n Both of them spoke up again, and says: \n \"No, we DIDN\u0027T. We never seen any marks at all.\" \n Well, everybody WAS in a state of mind now, and they sings out: \n \"The whole BILIN\u0027 of \u0027m \u0027s frauds! Le\u0027s duck \u0027em! le\u0027s drown \u0027em! le\u0027s ride \u0027em on a rail!\" and everybody was whooping at once, and there was a rattling powwow. But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells, and says: \n \"Gentlemen -- gentleMEN! Hear me just a word -- just a SINGLE word -- if you PLEASE! There\u0027s one way yet -- let\u0027s go and dig up the corpse and look.\" \n That took them. \n \"Hooray!\" they all shouted, and was starting right off; but the lawyer and the doctor sung out: \n \"Hold on, hold on! Collar all these four men and the boy, and fetch THEM along, too!\" \n \"We\u0027ll do it!\" they all shouted; \"and if we don\u0027t find them marks we\u0027ll lynch the whole gang!\" \n I WAS scared, now, I tell you. But there warn\u0027t no getting away, you know. They gripped us all, and marched us right along, straight for the graveyard, which was a mile and a half down the river, and the whole town at our heels, for we made noise enough, and it was only nine in the evening. \n As we went by our house I wished I hadn\u0027t sent Mary Jane out of town; because now if I could tip her the wink she\u0027d light out and save me, and blow on our dead-beats. \n Well, we swarmed along down the river road, just carrying on like wildcats; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up, and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter, and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves. This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was in; and I was kinder stunned; everything was going so different from what I had allowed for; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time if I wanted to, and see all the fun, and have Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close-fit come, here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks. If they didn\u0027t find them -- \n I couldn\u0027t bear to think about it; and yet, somehow, I couldn\u0027t think about nothing else. It got darker and darker, and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip; but that big husky had me by the wrist -- Hines -- and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip. He dragged me right along, he was so excited, and I had to run to keep up. \n When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow. And when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted, but nobody hadn\u0027t thought to fetch a lantern. But they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning, and sent a man to the nearest house, a half a mile off, to borrow one. \n So they dug and dug like everything; and it got awful dark, and the rain started, and the wind swished and swushed along, and the lightning come brisker and brisker, and the thunder boomed; but them people never took no notice of it, they was so full of this business; and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd, and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave, and the next second the dark wiped it all out, and you couldn\u0027t see nothing at all. \n At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid, and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was, to scrouge in and get a sight, you never see; and in the dark, that way, it was awful. Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so, and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world, he was so excited and panting. \n All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare, and somebody sings out: \n \"By the living jingo, here\u0027s the bag of gold on his breast!\" \n Hines let out a whoop, like everybody else, and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look, and the way I lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ain\u0027t nobody can tell. \n I had the road all to myself, and I fairly flew -- leastways, I had it all to myself except the solid dark, and the now-and-then glares, and the buzzing of the rain, and the thrashing of the wind, and the splitting of the thunder; and sure as you are born I did clip it along! \n When I struck the town I see there warn\u0027t nobody out in the storm, so I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it straight through the main one; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it. No light there; the house all dark -- which made me feel sorry and disappointed, I didn\u0027t know why. But at last, just as I was sailing by, FLASH comes the light in Mary Jane\u0027s window! and my heart swelled up sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark, and wasn\u0027t ever going to be before me no more in this world. She WAS the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand. \n The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the towhead, I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow, and the first time the lightning showed me one that wasn\u0027t chained I snatched it and shoved. It was a canoe, and warn\u0027t fastened with nothing but a rope. The towhead was a rattling big distance off, away out there in the middle of the river, but I didn\u0027t lose no time; and when I struck the raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could afforded it. But I didn\u0027t. As I sprung aboard I sung out: \n \"Out with you, Jim, and set her loose! Glory be to goodness, we\u0027re shut of them!\" \n Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me with both arms spread, he was so full of joy; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and lights out of me. But Jim fished me out, and was going to hug me and bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and the duke, but I says: \n \"Not now; have it for breakfast, have it for breakfast! Cut loose and let her slide!\" \n So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river, and it DID seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river, and nobody to bother us. I had to skip around a bit, and jump up and crack my heels a few times -- I couldn\u0027t help it; but about the third crack I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well, and held my breath and listened and waited; and sure enough, when the next flash busted out over the water, here they come! -- and just alaying to their oars and making their skiff hum! It was the king and the duke. \n 　　\"那天什么时间？\"\"傍晚，日落前一两个小时。\"\"你是怎么过来的？\"\"我坐苏珊·鲍威号，从辛辛那提来的船。\"\"好，那么，那天（早上）你是怎么到的上游那个码头上去啦--坐着独木舟？\"\"我那天早上根本没去码头。\"\"这是扯谎。\"有几个人跑过去，求他别这么对一个老人还是牧师这么讲话。\n 　　\"牧师个鬼！他是个坏蛋，是个骗子。那个早上他在上面码头那儿。我家就住在那儿，这不错吧？我在那里，他也在那里。我看到他在那里儿。他和提姆·柯林斯一起坐独木舟去的，还有个男孩儿。\"那个医生上来问道：\"海因斯，要是你见了那个男孩儿，还能认出来他吗？\"\"我想我可以认出来，不过也难说。\" 嘿，那不就是嘛。我很容易就认出他来啦。\"他指着的就是我。医生说：\"各位乡邻，我不知道新来的这一对是否是骗子；不过这两位如果不是骗子，那我就是个白痴，就这话。我认为我们得负责看住他们，别让他们从这里溜掉，等到我们查明白这件事情再说。过来，海因斯，过来，再来几位。我们要把这两个家伙带往客店，叫他们和那两个人当面对质，我想，用不着我们问完，我们就能弄个水落石出。\"这对大家都是难题，虽然对国王的朋友们没准不是；因此，我们就动身了。这大概是日落时分。那个医生抓住手领着我走，他对人可真够和气的，可就是一点儿不松我的手。\n 　　我们都走入了旅馆里的一个大房间，点着了几支蜡烛，把新来的那两个人也喊来。首先，医生说：\"我不希望跟这两个人太过不去，不过，我信他们是骗子，或许他们还有同谋，我们一点儿不知道。如果有的话，那些同谋会不会把彼得·威尔克斯遗留下来的那袋金币拿走呢？这也不是没可能。要是这两个人不是骗子，他们就不反对把那钱交出来，由我们代为保管，等到他们证明他们是没有问题的时候再谈--这样做好不好？\"大家都同意这样办。因此，我断定，一开头他们就会使我们这群人陷入困境。可是，国王只露出愁眉苦脸的样子说：\"诸位先生，但愿那笔钱还在，可我没有丝毫意思阻止大家调查这件事，要公开的，完全彻底地把这件倒霉事查个一清二楚。可是，唉！那笔钱已经不在了，你们可以派人去查看，只要你们想这么做。\"\"唉，我侄女给我让我帮她保存时，我拿去藏到我床上的草垫子里头了。我们在这儿只住几天，我不想把它存进银行。我还认为床上是个安全地方，我们不习惯黑人，认为他们很诚实，就跟英国的仆人一样。就在第二天早上我下楼之后，黑人已经把钱偷去了；当我把他们卖走时，还没发现钱不见了，因此，他们清白无辜地拿着钱走了。先生们，我这个仆人能给你们说清楚这件事。\"医生和那几个人说声\"胡说八道！\" 我看没人完全相信他。一个人问我是否看见黑人偷钱了。我说\"没有\"，但是我看到有人偷偷儿走出房间很快跑开，我根本就没想什么，只是觉得他们害怕惹恼我的主人，想到他找他们的事儿之前离开。他们就问了我这一句。后来，那医生忽然转身朝我发问道：\"他也是英国人吗？\"\"我说\u0027是\u0027，他跟其他几个人大笑起来，说声\u0027胡说！\u0027\"接着，他们就开始了全面调查，我们就这么翻来倒去被盘问了一个小时又一个小时，没人提吃晚饭，好像也没人想到这事儿似的，这样，他们问了又问，问个不停，那可最叫人头痛啦。他们让国王谈谈他的经历，又叫那位老先生谈他的，除去那一大块有成见的傻瓜，谁都可以看出来那老先生正在说实话，另一个在撒谎。后来，他们叫我过去说说我知道的事情。国王从左眼角斜我一眼，我就清楚说什么才对。我开始讲设菲尔德，我们在那里如何生活，说的全是英国威尔克斯家的情况，诸如此类等等。可是，我没讲多久，那医生就笑起来了。莱维·贝尔，就是那位律师，说道：\"坐下吧，我的孩子，我如果是你，我就不这么难为自己。我看你不习惯说谎，说起来好像还不怎么顺口，你需要的是锻炼。你做得很不怎么样。\"\"我一点儿也不在乎这些恭维的话，可我很高兴总算是放过我了。\"医生开口说话，转身道：\"如果你一开始就来镇上的话，莱维·贝尔..\"国王连忙插话，伸出手来说：\"噢，这位就是我那可怜兄弟常写信提到的老朋友吗？\"律师跟他握握手，微笑着，显得十分快活，他们马上谈了一阵，然后又走到一边小声交谈。最后，律师大声说：\"这么办就解决问题了。我把它跟你兄弟的声明一起递上去，到时候他们就知道没什么问题了。\"于是，他们拿出几张纸和一支笔，国王坐下来，头歪到一边，嚼着舌头，乱划了一气，然后，他们又把笔递给公爵--公爵这才第一次显出不自在的表情。但是，他接过笔写了字。然后，律师转向那位新来的老先生说：\"也请你和你兄弟写上两行字，签上你们的名字。\"那老先生写了，只是，谁也看不清他写的字。律师看来很惊讶，他说：\"啊，这下可真为难我了。\" 他猛地从口袋里抽出许多信来，仔细看着，又认真看看那老人写的字，接着又对比着看，最后说道：\" 这些是哈维·威尔克斯寄过来的旧信；这里是这两位的笔迹，谁都可以看出来这不是他们写的。\" (国王和公爵一脸上当受骗傻瓜笨蛋的模样，眼看着律师设圈套捉弄了他们。)\"这是这位老先生的笔迹，清楚明白，谁都看得出来，这些信不是他写的。事实上，他涂抹的根本算不上是什么字。这里还有一封信，是...\"那位新来的老先生插话说：\"请听我来解释，众位。除了我这个兄弟，没人认识我的手迹--因此，他替我抄写。你这里的这几封信是他的手迹，而不是我的。\"\"啊！\" 律师说，\" 这倒是件挺稀罕的事。我这儿也有威廉的几封信，因此，要是你能叫他写上一两行，我们就可以..\"\"他现在不能用右手写，\"老先生说，\" 如果他能用右手写，你会看出来我的信跟他的信是一个人写的。请把两种信都看看--它们出自一个人的手迹。\"律师看了看，说：\"我相信如此，即使不是这样，反正也有许多非常相似之处，我过去倒没注意过。好啦，好啦，好啦！我本来想我们很快就可以找到解决的途径，谁知在一定程度上又发现了偏差。只是，不管怎么说，有一点是证实了：（这俩）没有一个是威尔克斯家的人。\" 他冲国王和公爵摇摇头。\n 　　嘿，你猜怎么着？都到了这份儿上了，那个驴子脑袋的老傻瓜还不想服输！确实他也不服。他说这种测试不公平。他说他兄弟威廉是个缺德鬼，又爱开玩笑，他刚才一点儿没打算写好--威廉一拿起笔要在纸上写字时，他就看出来了威廉想开个大玩笑。就这样他又来劲儿了，哇啦哇啦直说个不停，说得还真有些相信他说的话来了，当然是他自己信。很快，那新来的老先生插嘴道：\"我想起一件事。这里有没有人帮过忙，替我弟--那位刚过世的彼得·威尔克斯入殓？\"\"有，\"有人答话，\" 是我和阿布·特纳一起干的。我们俩都在。\"然后，那老人转向国王说：\"或许这位拜能告诉我他胸口刺的是什么样的花纹吧？\"见鬼，国王不得不马上强打精神来对付，否则，他就会像被大水冲走了根基的堤岸一样轰然坍塌。问题来得如此突然，跟你说吧，冷不丁地提出这么个有根有据的问题，任谁都会手足无措，因为他如何会知道那人身上刺的什么花纹呢？他脸色煞白了一阵儿，这是不由自主，房里特别静，每个人都朝前倾着身体，盯着他看。我心想，这回他准得认输了，再怎么着也没用。好嘛，他认输吗？恐怕谁都不会相信，可他就是不低头。我看他是想这么硬撑着，等到把他们这帮人都累垮了，他们就会散去，他和公爵好脱身逃走。不论怎样，他坐在那里，不久，他开始微笑，说着：\"嗬！这可是个非常难答的问题呀，不是吗？是的，先生，我可以告诉你他胸前刺的花纹。那是个小小的、细细的蓝色箭头，刺的就是那个，如果你不细看，你还看不见。现在，你有什么可说的，喂？\"我可真没见过这样的一点儿脸皮都不要的老坏蛋。\n 　　那位新来的老先生兴冲冲地转向阿布·特纳和他的同伴，眼睛发亮，像是这一回他断定他抓到国王的把柄了，他说：\"好啦，你们都听到他说的话啦！彼得·威尔克斯胸口有这种记号吗？\"两个人一齐说道：\"我们没看到这种记号。\"\"好！\" 老先生说，\" 其实，你们在他胸口看到的是一个极小的、不甚清楚的P 和一个B(这是个名字的第一个字母，他年轻时已经不用了)，还有一个W，三个字母中间有连字符，是这样的：P- B-W。\" --他还在一张纸上照样给画了出来。\"来，你们看到的是否是这个？\"两个人又一起开口说：\"不，我们没看见。我们根本没看到什么记号。\"老天，每个人这阵子可都耐不住了，他们高叫起来：\"全是骗子！把他们摁到水里！淹死他们！把他们抬着扛上游街！\" 大家一齐嚷嚷，噼哩啪啦，乱成一团。不过，那个律师跳往桌上，喊着说：\"诸位--诸--位！听我一句话，就一句话，请你们（听着啊）！还有一个方法，我们去把尸体挖出来看看。\"这一来把他们镇住了。\n 　　\"好哇！\" 他们都欢呼起来，立刻就要动身，但是，那个律师和医生喊道：\"停，停！抓住这四个人和这小孩子，带他们一起去！\"\"我们就这么办！\" 他们一齐喊：\" 如果找不见这些记号的话，我们就把这群人都绞死！\"这下，我真被吓坏了，告诉你吧。不过你也知道，我也没法子逃走。他们紧紧地抓住我们几个，一块儿向前走，径直往坟地里，在大河下面一英里半的地方，全镇的人都跟在我们身后，由于我们的吵闹声太大了，当时刚晚上九点钟。\n 　　当我路过我们那所房子的时候，我想，如果我没让玛丽·简到镇外去有多好；因为这会儿，如果我给她使个眼色，她就会立刻跑过来搭救我，让那两个该死的坏蛋名誉扫地。\n 　　这样，我们蜂拥着沿河边的大路朝前走，吵吵闹闹乱喊乱叫如同一群野猫。更令人惊恐不安的是，天也黑起来了，闪电开始在空中划过，风吹动树叶瑟瑟直颤。这是我碰上的最可怕最危险的遭遇，我给吓得有些晕晕的，什么事情跟我当初考虑的完全两样了。要是按我的安排，如果我愿意的话，我可以悠悠闲闲地从头至尾看热闹，遇到紧急关头还能让玛丽为我撑腰，救我出去，给我自由。可是现在，这个世上什么都指望不上了，在我和突然死亡中间，全凭着胸口刺的那些花纹。如果他们找不到那些--我几乎不敢再想下去了。可是，不知怎么回事，我又想不起来别的事情。天越来越黑，这可是甩掉这帮人的绝好时机。可是，那个高个子壮汉紧攥着我的手腕儿--就是那个海因斯--想挣脱他简直就像是想从歌利亚手里逃脱一样难。他拖着我走，他太激动了，我得不断跑步才能跟上他。\n 　　他们去了那里，一下子拥入坟地，像泛滥的潮水一样把坟地淹没了。他们找见那座坟，这才发觉他们带的铁锨比需要的能多出近百倍，可就没有人想到得带盏灯来。但是，他们还是借着闪电的亮光立即动手挖掘，并且派人到半英里地外最近的人家去借盏灯。\n 　　他们疯狂地挖呀挖呀，天黑得吓人，雨开始下了，风嗖嗖呼呼地刮，闪电越闪越亮，雷声也轰隆轰隆响个不停，但是，那些人一点儿没在意，他们心里装满了这件事。闪电一晃的瞬间，你可以看清那一大群人的每个动作，每张脸，还有从塞穴里挖出来一锨一锨挥舞的泥土，又是一晃，黑暗便笼罩了一切，你什么也看不清。\n 　　最后，他们挖出了棺材，开始拧螺丝卸棺材盖儿，这阵，又一阵人拥肩挤，相互推搡，全想靠到近前看个热闹，那情景你简直没见过；在黑暗中，那个挤法儿真可怕。海因斯生拉硬拽，把我的手腕儿握得生痛，我看他是把我的存在忘得一干二净了，他太激动了，喘着粗气。\n 　　猛然间，一道闪电划出一大片白光，有人叫道：\"啊，老天作证，他胸口是那袋金币！\"海因斯跟别人一样一声呼叫，丢开我的手腕儿，情绪激昂，拼命往里挤，想看上一眼。趁着一团漆黑，我撒腿就奔，朝大跑上飞跑，那股劲头儿，谁都受不了。\n 　　我一个人在路上跑着，疾步如飞。除了深夜的黑暗，一阵一阵的闪电，咝咝雨声，呼呼风吹，还有那霹雳雷鸣，一路上就我一个人，确确实实，我是在朝前飞！\n 　　我跑到镇上，看见没人在外面的暴风雨中，因此，根本就用不着找背街巷，而是在大街上直穿过去；当我开始往我们房子那边跑去时，我眯着眼睛看了看。那里没有灯光，整座房子漆黑一片--这令我感到难过与失望，我不明白为什么。可是，当我就要跑过去时，刷的一道灯光闪现在玛丽·简的窗口！我的心猛地跳起来，像要爆炸。转瞬间，那座房子跟周围的一切全都留到我身后的黑暗中了，在这个世界上再也不会出现在我面前了。她是我见过的最好的姑娘，最有勇气和胆量。\n 　　我跑走，离开那个镇，看到可以朝沙洲方向去了，我就开始细细找，想借条船用。闪电一亮，我看到有一条船没用链条拴，我抓过来划开了。这是只独木舟，只拴了根绳子。沙洲还有很远一段距离，在大河正中。但我，我一点也没耽搁，当我终于划到了木排那儿，累趴下了，如果耽搁得起的话，我真想躺下来喘口气，可我没有。我一跳上木排就喊：\"出来呀，吉姆，快解开木排！感谢上帝，我们终于甩掉他们啦！\"吉姆赶紧出来，两臂张着向我走来，他满心欢喜。但是，当我趁着闪电瞥到他的时候，我的心一下跳到了嗓子眼儿里，我倒背着一个跟头栽到水里。因为我忘了，他既穿着老李尔王的衣服，又活像个淹死的阿拉伯人，他险些把我吓得灵魂出窍。只是，吉姆把我捞了上来，马上就要拥抱我，祝福我。我能回来，并且我们还甩掉了国王和公爵，他简直高兴坏了，但是我说：\"现在不行，等吃过早饭再说，等吃过早饭再说，解开木排，让它漂吧！\"这样，一两秒钟之后，我们就漂出去了，顺着大河朝下漂，一条大河就我们俩，没人来搅和，重获自由了，真好啊。我不由自主地来回蹦跶几下，跳起来磕磕脚后跟，可以说情不自禁。但是，大约磕到第三下，我听到一种声音，特别耳熟，我屏住呼吸细细听着等着，当又一道闪光划过水面时，一点儿没错，他们来啦！--正拼命划浆，划得他们的小船吱吱叫！正是国王和公爵。\n 　　接着，我一下子垮了下来，瘫倒在木排板上，事已至此，只得认命。我所能做的一切，光是忍住自己的悲伤。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/71/3909.html","bookId":546,"book":{"id":546,"title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry
