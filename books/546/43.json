{"id":41900,"no":43,"title":"Chapter 43","content":"THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea, time of the evasion? -- what it was he\u0027d planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before? And he said, what he had planned in his head from the start, if we got Jim out all safe, was for us to run him down the river on the raft, and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style, and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would we. But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was. \n We had Jim out of the chains in no time, and when Aunt Polly and Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom, they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do. And we had him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and Tom give Jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good, and Jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says: \n \"DAH, now, Huck, what I tell you? -- what I tell you up dah on Jackson islan\u0027? I TOLE you I got a hairy breas\u0027, en what\u0027s de sign un it; en I TOLE you I ben rich wunst, en gwineter to be rich AGIN; en it\u0027s come true; en heah she is! DAH, now! doan\u0027 talk to ME -- signs is SIGNS, mine I tell you; en I knowed jis\u0027 \u0027s well \u0027at I \u0027uz gwineter be rich agin as I\u0027s astannin\u0027 heah dis minute!\" \n And then Tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le\u0027s all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for howling adventures amongst the Injuns, over in the Territory, for a couple of weeks or two; and I says, all right, that suits me, but I ain\u0027t got no money for to buy the outfit, and I reckon I couldn\u0027t get none from home, because it\u0027s likely pap\u0027s been back before now, and got it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up. \n \"No, he hain\u0027t,\" Tom says; \"it\u0027s all there yet -- six thousand dollars and more; and your pap hain\u0027t ever been back since. Hadn\u0027t when I come away, anyhow.\" \n Jim says, kind of solemn: \n \"He ain\u0027t a-comin\u0027 back no mo\u0027, Huck.\" \n I says: \n \"Why, Jim?\" \n \"Nemmine why, Huck -- but he ain\u0027t comin\u0027 back no mo.\" \n But I kept at him; so at last he says: \n \"Doan\u0027 you \u0027member de house dat was float\u0027n down de river, en dey wuz a man in dah, kivered up, en I went in en unkivered him and didn\u0027 let you come in? Well, den, you kin git yo\u0027 money when you wants it, kase dat wuz him.\" \n 　　我们赶忙把吉姆的镣铐打开，当波丽阿姨，还有赛拉斯姨父和莎丽姨知道了他帮助大夫把汤姆照料得有多好时，他们着实夸奖了他一番，给他穿上最漂亮的衣裳，还让他吃所有想吃的东西，让他痛痛快快地玩儿，什么也不必干。我领他到病房，热热闹闹聊了一阵话，汤姆给了吉姆40 块钱，表彰他为我们当囚犯当得那么有耐心，做得那么出色，吉姆快活得要死，放声大笑说：\"啊，怎么样了，哈克，我给你说什么了？在杰克逊岛上我对你说什么了？我告诉过你我胸口长毛这是个什么好兆头，我告诉过你我阔气过一次，以后还会阔的。眼下它灵验了，好运气来啦！眼前这就来啦！别跟我说兆头仅仅是兆头，记住我的话，我早知道我还会阔气的，就像我如今站在这儿一样不会有错！\"接着汤姆说开了，一直说个没完，他说让我们三个在哪天夜里从这儿偷跑出去，带上全套用品，到印第安人中间，在他们居住的州里，轰轰烈烈搞把历险，闹它两三个星期。我说，好吧，这对于我很合适，不过我没钱去买那套用品，我想也不能从家里弄钱，因为爸爸很可能早已回去了，从萨切尔法官那儿把钱全拿走，喝酒花光了。\n 　　\"不，他没，\"汤姆说，\" 钱都还在那儿。六千块还要多，你爸打那以后没回去过。反正我来的时候，一直没回去过。\"吉姆说话了，神情严肃：\"他再也不会回来了，哈克。\"我说：\"你说什么，吉姆？\"\"哈克--他再也不会回来了。\"因此我盯着问他，所以他终于说道：\"你不记得顺着河漂下来的那所房子吗？那儿有一个人，身上盖着块布，我进去把它揭开了，没让你进去，记得吗？好啊，你什么时候想要你的钱，你就可以拿到手，因为那个人就是他。\"汤姆现在已经几乎全好了，他把那颗子弹拴到表链上挂在脖子上当成一块表，还总是看几点几分了。因此，再没有什么可写的了，我是高兴坏了，因为我要是早知道作一本书有这么麻烦，我压根儿就不会动手，也不打算再作了。不过我估计我过去已经得在其他二位前头赶快跑到印第安人那里去，因为莎丽阿姨她想收养我、教化我，我可受不了这个。我过去已经受够了。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/71/3923.html","bookId":546,"book":{"id":546,"title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn哈克贝里·芬历险记","description":"简介： Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a book by Mark Twain, first published in England in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885.
