{"id":41888,"no":31,"title":"Chapter 31","content":"WE dasn\u0027t stop again at any town for days and days; kept right along down the river. We was down south in the warm weather now, and a mighty long ways from home. We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them, hanging down from the limbs like long, gray beards. It was the first I ever see it growing, and it made the woods look solemn and dismal. So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger, and they begun to work the villages again. \n First they done a lecture on temperance; but they didn\u0027t make enough for them both to get drunk on. Then in another village they started a dancing-school; but they didn\u0027t know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town. Another time they tried to go at yellocution; but they didn\u0027t yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing, and made them skip out. They tackled missionarying, and mesmerizing, and doctoring, and telling fortunes, and a little of everything; but they couldn\u0027t seem to have no luck. So at last they got just about dead broke, and laid around the raft as she floated along, thinking and thinking, and never saying nothing, by the half a day at a time, and dreadful blue and desperate. \n And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time. Jim and me got uneasy. We didn\u0027t like the look of it. We judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever. We turned it over and over, and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebody\u0027s house or store, or was going into the counterfeitmoney business, or something. So then we was pretty scared, and made up an agreement that we wouldn\u0027t have nothing in the world to do with such actions, and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind. Well, early one morning we hid the raft in a good, safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville, and the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet. (\"House to rob, you MEAN,\" says I to myself; \"and when you get through robbing it you\u0027ll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raft -- and you\u0027ll have to take it out in wondering.\") And he said if he warn\u0027t back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right, and we was to come along. \n So we stayed where we was. The duke he fretted and sweated around, and was in a mighty sour way. He scolded us for everything, and we couldn\u0027t seem to do nothing right; he found fault with every little thing. Something was a-brewing, sure. I was good and glad when midday come and no king; we could have a change, anyway -- and maybe a chance for THE chance on top of it. So me and the duke went up to the village, and hunted around there for the king, and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery, very tight, and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport, and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all his might, and so tight he couldn\u0027t walk, and couldn\u0027t do nothing to them. The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool, and the king begun to sass back, and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs, and spun down the river road like a deer, for I see our chance; and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again. I got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy, and sung out: \n \"Set her loose, Jim! we\u0027re all right now!\" \n But there warn\u0027t no answer, and nobody come out of the wigwam. Jim was gone! I set up a shout -- and then another -- and then another one; and run this way and that in the woods, whooping and screeching; but it warn\u0027t no use -- old Jim was gone. Then I set down and cried; I couldn\u0027t help it. But I couldn\u0027t set still long. Pretty soon I went out on the road, trying to think what I better do, and I run across a boy walking, and asked him if he\u0027d seen a strange nigger dressed so and so, and he says: \n \"Yes.\" \n \"Whereabouts?\" says I. \n \"Down to Silas Phelps\u0027 place, two mile below here. He\u0027s a runaway nigger, and they\u0027ve got him. Was you looking for him?\" \n \"You bet I ain\u0027t! I run across him in the woods about an hour or two ago, and he said if I hollered he\u0027d cut my livers out -- and told me to lay down and stay where I was; and I done it. Been there ever since; afeard to come out.\" \n \"Well,\" he says, \"you needn\u0027t be afeard no more, becuz they\u0027ve got him. He run off f\u0027m down South, som\u0027ers.\" \n \"It\u0027s a good job they got him.\" \n \"Well, I RECKON! There\u0027s two hunderd dollars reward on him. It\u0027s like picking up money out\u0027n the road.\" \n \"Yes, it is -- and I could a had it if I\u0027d been big enough; I see him FIRST. Who nailed him?\" \n \"It was an old fellow -- a stranger -- and he sold out his chance in him for forty dollars, becuz he\u0027s got to go up the river and can\u0027t wait. Think o\u0027 that, now! You bet I\u0027D wait, if it was seven year.\" \n \"That\u0027s me, every time,\" says I. \"But maybe his chance ain\u0027t worth no more than that, if he\u0027ll sell it so cheap. Maybe there\u0027s something ain\u0027t straight about it.\" \n \"But it IS, though -- straight as a string. I see the handbill myself. It tells all about him, to a dot -- paints him like a picture, and tells the plantation he\u0027s frum, below NewrLEANS. No-sirree-BOB, they ain\u0027t no trouble \u0027bout THAT speculation, you bet you. Say, gimme a chaw tobacker, won\u0027t ye?\" \n I didn\u0027t have none, so he left. I went to the raft, and set down in the wigwam to think. But I couldn\u0027t come to nothing. I thought till I wore my head sore, but I couldn\u0027t see no way out of the trouble. After all this long journey, and after all we\u0027d done for them scoundrels, here it was all come to nothing, everything all busted up and ruined, because they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that, and make him a slave again all his life, and amongst strangers, too, for forty dirty dollars. \n Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a slave at home where his family was, as long as he\u0027d GOT to be a slave, and so I\u0027d better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell Miss Watson where he was. But I soon give up that notion for two things: she\u0027d be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her, and so she\u0027d sell him straight down the river again; and if she didn\u0027t, everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger, and they\u0027d make Jim feel it all the time, and so he\u0027d feel ornery and disgraced. And then think of ME! It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom; and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again I\u0027d be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame. That\u0027s just the way: a person does a low-down thing, and then he don\u0027t want to take no consequences of it. Thinks as long as he can hide, it ain\u0027t no disgrace. That was my fix exactly. The more I studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me, and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling. And at last, when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven,whilst I was stealing a poor old woman\u0027s nigger that hadn\u0027t ever done me no harm, and now was showing me there\u0027s One that\u0027s always on the lookout, and ain\u0027t agoing to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further, I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared. Well, I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked, and so I warn\u0027t so much to blame; but something inside of me kept saying, \"There was the Sunday-school, you could a gone to it; and if you\u0027d a done it they\u0027d a learnt you there that people that acts as I\u0027d been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire.\" \n It made me shiver. And I about made up my mind to pray, and see if I couldn\u0027t try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better. So I kneeled down. But the words wouldn\u0027t come. Why wouldn\u0027t they? It warn\u0027t no use to try and hide it from Him. Nor from ME, neither. I knowed very well why they wouldn\u0027t come. It was because my heart warn\u0027t right; it was because I warn\u0027t square; it was because I was playing double. I was letting ON to give up sin, but away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all. I was trying to make my mouth SAY I would do the right thing and the clean thing, and go and write to that nigger\u0027s owner and tell where he was; but deep down in me I knowed it was a lie, and He knowed it. You can\u0027t pray a lie -- I found that out. \n So I was full of trouble, full as I could be; and didn\u0027t know what to do. At last I had an idea; and I says, I\u0027ll go and write the letter -- and then see if I can pray. Why, it was astonishing, the way I felt as light as a feather right straight off, and my troubles all gone. So I got a piece of paper and a pencil, all glad and excited, and set down and wrote: \n Miss Watson, your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville, and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send. \n HUCK FINN. \n I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life, and I knowed I could pray now. But I didn\u0027t do it straight off, but laid the paper down and set there thinking -- thinking how good it was all this happened so, and how near I come to being lost and going to hell. And went on thinking. And got to thinking over our trip down the river; and I see Jim before me all the time: in the day and in the night-time, sometimes moonlight, sometimes storms, and we a-floating along, talking and singing and laughing. But somehow I couldn\u0027t seem to strike no places to harden me against him, but only the other kind. I\u0027d see him standing my watch on top of his\u0027n, \u0027stead of calling me, so I could go on sleeping; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog; and when I come to him again in the swamp, up there where the feud was; and such-like times; and would always call me honey, and pet me and do everything he could think of for me, and how good he always was; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard, and he was so grateful, and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world, and the ONLY one he\u0027s got now; and then I happened to look around and see that paper. \n It was a close place. I took it up, and held it in my hand. I was a-trembling, because I\u0027d got to decide, forever, betwixt two things, and I knowed it. I studied a minute, sort of holding my breath, and then says to myself: \n \"All right, then, I\u0027ll GO to hell\" -- and tore it up. \n It was awful thoughts and awful words, but they was said. And I let them stay said; and never thought no more about reforming. I shoved the whole thing out of my head, and said I would take up wickedness again, which was in my line, being brung up to it, and the other warn\u0027t. And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again; and if I could think up anything worse, I would do that, too; because as long as I was in, and in for good, I might as well go the whole hog. \n Then I set to thinking over how to get at it, and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me. So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece, and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it, and hid it there, and then turned in. I slept the night through, and got up before it was light, and had my breakfast, and put on my store clothes, and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle, and took the canoe and cleared for shore. I landed below where I judged was Phelps\u0027s place, and hid my bundle in the woods, and then filled up the canoe with water, and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her, about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank. \n Then I struck up the road, and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it, \"Phelps\u0027s Sawmill,\" and when I come to the farm-houses, two or three hundred yards further along, I kept my eyes peeled, but didn\u0027t see nobody around, though it was good daylight now. But I didn\u0027t mind, because I didn\u0027t want to see nobody just yet -- I only wanted to get the lay of the land. According to my plan, I was going to turn up there from the village, not from below. So I just took a look, and shoved along, straight for town. Well, the very first man I see when I got there was the duke. He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch -- three-night performance -- like that other time. They had the cheek, them frauds! I was right on him before I could shirk. He looked astonished, and says: \n \"Hel-LO! Where\u0027d YOU come from?\" Then he says, kind of glad and eager, \"Where\u0027s the raft? -- got her in a good place?\" \n I says: \n \"Why, that\u0027s just what I was going to ask your grace.\" \n Then he didn\u0027t look so joyful, and says: \n \"What was your idea for asking ME?\" he says. \n \"Well,\" I says, \"when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to myself, we can\u0027t get him home for hours, till he\u0027s soberer; so I went a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait. A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep, and so I went along; but when we was dragging him to the boat, and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along, he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run, and we after him. We didn\u0027t have no dog, and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out. We never got him till dark; then we fetched him over, and I started down for the raft. When I got there and see it was gone, I says to myself, \u0027They\u0027ve got into trouble and had to leave; and they\u0027ve took my nigger, which is the only nigger I\u0027ve got in the world, and now I\u0027m in a strange country, and ain\u0027t got no property no more, nor nothing, and no way to make my living;\u0027 so I set down and cried. I slept in the woods all night. But what DID become of the raft, then? -- and Jim -- poor Jim!\" \n \"Blamed if I know -- that is, what\u0027s become of the raft. That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars, and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but what he\u0027d spent for whisky; and when I got him home late last night and found the raft gone, we said, \u0027That little rascal has stole our raft and shook us, and run off down the river.\u0027\" \n \"I wouldn\u0027t shake my NIGGER, would I? -- the only nigger I had in the world, and the only property.\" \n \"We never thought of that. Fact is, I reckon we\u0027d come to consider him OUR nigger; yes, we did consider him so -- goodness knows we had trouble enough for him. So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke, there warn\u0027t anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake. And I\u0027ve pegged along ever since, dry as a powder-horn. Where\u0027s that ten cents? Give it here.\" \n I had considerable money, so I give him ten cents, but begged him to spend it for something to eat, and give me some, because it was all the money I had, and I hadn\u0027t had nothing to eat since yesterday. He never said nothing. The next minute he whirls on me and says: \n \"Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us? We\u0027d skin him if he done that!\" \n \"How can he blow? Hain\u0027t he run off?\" \n \"No! That old fool sold him, and never divided with me, and the money\u0027s gone.\" \n \"SOLD him?\" I says, and begun to cry; \"why, he was MY nigger, and that was my money. Where is he? -- I want my nigger.\" \n \"Well, you can\u0027t GET your nigger, that\u0027s all -- so dry up your blubbering. Looky here -- do you think YOU\u0027D venture to blow on us? Blamed if I think I\u0027d trust you. Why, if you WAS to blow on us --\" \n He stopped, but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before. I went on a-whimpering, and says: \n \"I don\u0027t want to blow on nobody; and I ain\u0027t got no time to blow, nohow. I got to turn out and find my nigger.\" \n He looked kinder bothered, and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm, thinking, and wrinkling up his forehead. At last he says: \n \"I\u0027ll tell you something. We got to be here three days. If you\u0027ll promise you won\u0027t blow, and won\u0027t let the nigger blow, I\u0027ll tell you where to find him.\" \n So I promised, and he says: \n \"A farmer by the name of Silas Ph----\" and then he stopped. You see, he started to tell me the truth; but when he stopped that way, and begun to study and think again, I reckoned he was changing his mind. And so he was. He wouldn\u0027t trust me; he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days. So pretty soon he says: \n \"The man that bought him is named Abram Foster -- Abram G. Foster -- and he lives forty mile back here in the country, on the road to Lafayette.\" \n \"All right,\" I says, \"I can walk it in three days. And I\u0027ll start this very afternoon.\" \n \"No you wont, you\u0027ll start NOW; and don\u0027t you lose any time about it, neither, nor do any gabbling by the way. Just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along, and then you won\u0027t get into trouble with US, d\u0027ye hear?\" \n That was the order I wanted, and that was the one I played for. I wanted to be left free to work my plans. \n \"So clear out,\" he says; \"and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want to. Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim IS your nigger -- some idiots don\u0027t require documents -- leastways I\u0027ve heard there\u0027s such down South here. And when you tell him the handbill and the reward\u0027s bogus, maybe he\u0027ll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting \u0027em out. Go \u0027long now, and tell him anything you want to; but mind you don\u0027t work your jaw any BETWEEN here and there.\" \n 　　首先，他们做过了个戒酒演讲，可到手的钱还不够他们俩醉酒。然后，在另一个村里，他们举办了个舞蹈班，可是他们对于跳舞并不比一只袋鼠知道得多，因此，他们刚开始蹦跶，大伙儿就把他们从村里赶走了。又有一回，他们试着教演说，可是他们还没有演说多大会儿，观众就站起来，给他们一顿足足的臭骂，骂得他们赶快溜出去了。他们还试过传教、催眠、看病、算命等，各种手段都耍尽了，可他们好像不交好运。所以，到了后来，他们几乎步入绝境了，躺在木排上，任它漂流，一直想啊想啊，一声不吭，有时一躺就是半天，全然一副愁眉苦脸走投无路的样子。\n 　　终于，他们变了个样子，又开始在窝棚里一同密谋，低低小声商量，有时叽叽咕咕一说就是两三个小时。我跟吉姆开始忐忑不安。我们不想看那种情景。我们断定他们正在想着有史以来最坏的鬼点子。我们想了又想，最后拿准了，他们是要入室抢劫，或者抢店铺，再不然就是准备干制作伪钞假钱等等这类勾当。我们吓坏了，两人一致商定，决不跟这类事情有任何牵连，一有机会，我们就甩掉他们，赶快离开，把他们丢在后面。后来有一天一大清早，我们在离一个叫派克斯维尔的破烂小村下边两英里来地，找到个安全的地方藏好木排，国王要上岸，他让我们全都躲在这里，他一个人到村里去打探一把，看是否有人听到了皇室奇物的风声。(\"你是说要找个人家抢东西吧，\"我心里想，\" 等你们抢完了东西再到这里就找不见我和吉姆还有木排了--到时候你们必定无路可走。\" )他又说，如果中午他还没回来，我和公爵就会知道一切顺利，我们就要一起到村里去。\n 　　于是，我们就坐在那儿等。公爵烦躁不安，着急得不停踱步，显得十分郁闷寡欢。我们干什么他都大声吵，好像我们什么都做得不对，大事小事他都挑毛病。肯定是要发生什么事。中午到了，国王没来，我感觉良好，也很高兴，无论怎样，我们能有个变化，说不定还真是那个变化的良机呢，我没准真能碰上。于是，我和公爵到那个村上去，到处找国王，最后在一个很小的下等酒吧后面的一个房间找到了他。他已喝得醉醺醺的，一帮二流子正在拿他开玩笑，他用劲尽全身气力骂他们吓唬他们，可他醉得连路都走不动，对他们毫无办法。公爵骂他，说他是个老糊涂，国王因此便回骂。趁他们骂得热闹，我悄悄儿溜出来，撒开两腿拼命路，跟只小鹿一样沿着河边大路一直飞奔，因为我看到我们的机会来了，我下决心再不让他们看到我和吉姆了。我跑到地方，气也喘不上来了，可是心里高兴坏了，大声喊道：\"解开木排，吉姆，这回我们可好啦！\"可没有任何回音，也没有人从窝棚里出来。吉姆不见了！我使足劲儿喊了一声，又喊一声，紧接着又喊一声，我在树林里四处奔跑，高声喊尖声叫，可是全没用，老吉姆不见。后来，我就坐在地上哭，我忍不住。但是，我又不能总坐着不动。不久我走到大路上，想想我最好怎么办，我碰上个走路的小孩儿，就问他是不是看见过一个陌生的黑人，穿什么什么样的衣服。他说：\"看见了。\"\"上哪儿了？\"我问。\n 　　\"到下面赛拉斯·斐尔普斯家去了，离这儿大约二英里。他是个逃跑的黑奴，他们抓到了他。你是找他吗？\"\"我当然不是找他。一两个小时前，我在树林内碰上他，他说我如果喊叫就把我的心肝挖出来，他叫我躺地上别动，我就照办了。打那阵开始我一直在那里不敢出来。\"\"好啦，\"他说，\" 你不用害怕了，因为他们抓住他了。他是从南方什么地方逃到这里来的。\"\"他们抓住了他，可真是件好事。\"\"我看也是！他的赏格有两百块钱。这就跟在大路上弯下腰捡钱一样容易。\"\"是啊，一点不错。如果我长得大些，我也能得到这笔钱，我最先看到他，谁逮住他了？\"\"是一个老头儿，一个生人，他将那黑人的赏格卖了四十块钱，因为他要急着朝大河上游去，不能再等。嘿，想想看！要是我，就算是七年我也等。\"\"换了我也这么想。\" 我说，\" 只是，要是他卖这么低，他的赏格或许就值不了这么多钱。这老头儿没准有些什么不清不楚呢。\"\"可它清清楚楚，清楚得像一根绳子。我亲眼看过那张悬赏传单了。上面写着他的全部情况，一丝不差，就像是给他画了张像，还写了他从哪个农场逃出来的，在新奥尔良下面。没问题，这笔投机生意里头没差错，肯定无疑。喂，给我口烟叶嚼嚼？\"我根本没有，因此他走了。我上了木排，在窝棚里坐下来想。可，我什么办法也想不出来。想得头都胀了，可还是想不出办法解决这个倒霉问题。经过这么长的一段路，我们不住忙活着伺候这两个坏蛋，到头来落了个一场空，一切全都完了。因为他们的心肠竟然坏到这种地步，对吉姆耍弄这样卑鄙的手段，又叫他一辈子做奴隶，还流落在异地他乡，仅仅为了40块肮脏钱。\n 　　我心里也想过，要是吉姆注定要做奴隶，那还不如在老家当个奴隶，跟他的亲人在一起，也比这儿强千倍，因此，我最好是写信给汤姆·索亚，让他告诉华森小姐吉姆在哪儿。只是，我很快就放弃了这个打算，这儿有两个原因：她会因为吉姆离开她而生气并讨厌吉姆，觉得他卑鄙无耻又忘恩负义，所以，她会很快把他卖到大河下游去，即便她不这么做，大家也自然会看不起一个忘恩负义的黑人，他们会让吉姆时时处处都感觉到这一点，这样，他就会觉得难堪，没脸见人。接下去再想想我！一下子大家会四处张扬，说哈克·芬帮助一个黑奴争取自由，那么，要是我有一天再见到那个镇上的人，还得准备着跪在地上，舔着人家的靴子求饶，真没面子。事情往往是这样：一个人做了下贱的事儿，就不想去承担后果，只要他能瞒得过去，那就不算是没面子。可这正是我的难处。我越思谋这件事，我的良心就越受折磨，我就越感到自己卑鄙下流和难堪。终于，我猛地明白过来，这明明是上帝的手在打我的耳光，让我知道，我做的坏事在天上一直有神灵看着，他只允许这种坏事做到一定限度，不允许再向下进行了，想到这里，我吓坏了，几乎当场就倒下去。于是，我拼命想着法儿来减轻一些自己的罪过，说我是打小就被带坏了，所以，我并没有多少可责怪的。可是我心里总在说：\" 有主日学校，你可以去上学；要是你去了，他们就会告诉你，谁像我那样对待黑奴，就得下到永劫不复的地狱烈火中。\"这令我颤栗不已。我下决心做祷告，看看我能不能试着不当过去那种坏孩子，当个好孩子。于是，我跪下了。可是祷告的话说不出来。为什么它们不出来呢？想瞒上帝是没有用的，当然也瞒不过我自己。我很明白为什么祷告不出来。这是因为我的心不正，因为我不正大光明，因为我在耍滑头两边倒。我一面在装作放弃罪过，可我心中还装着那件最大的罪。我试着让我的嘴说我想做正经事儿，做清白的事儿，要给那个黑奴的主人写信，告诉她他在哪儿，可内心深处我就知道这是个谎言，上帝也知道这是谎言。祷告可不能撒谎，我算是明白这点了。因此，我心里烦恼，烦得要命，不知道如何才好。最后，我有了个主意，我说，我这就去写这封信，然后，再看我能否祷告出来。嘿，真奇怪，我马上就觉得轻松得像根羽毛，烦恼变得烟消云散了。于是，我取出一张纸一支铅笔，又高兴又激动，坐下来写道：华森小姐你的逃跑的黑奴吉姆逃到了离这里两英里地远的派克斯维尔村斐尔普斯先生抓到了他如果你送来赏金他就会把人放了。\n 　　哈克·芬我感觉很不错，身上的罪像是一下子都给洗清了，我平生还是头一回有这样的感觉，我知道我现在可以祷告了。不过我没有马上祷告，而是放下那张纸，坐到那里想，想想我做的这些该有多好，我误入歧途，险些下到地狱。然后又接着想，不知不觉反复想到我们顺着大河漂下来走过的这一段日子。我总是看见吉姆在我眼前，在白天，在夜晚，有时在月光下，有时在暴风雨里，我们一起漂啊漂，说着话，唱着歌，又一起哈哈大笑。可是不知怎么的，我好像都挑不出一点儿地方让我狠起心来对他，想到的反而全是他的好处。我总是看见他值完了他的班，又接着替我值班，不叫醒我，这样我就可以接着睡觉；看见他见到我打那场大雾里回来时是多么高兴；还有我在沼泽地里又一次找到他的时候，就在遇到家族世仇的地方；还有好多类似的时候，他总是叫我宝贝，对我那么亲热，为我做他能想到的一切，他总那么好，最后我想到了那一次我救了他，告诉那两个人说我们木排上有人害天花，他对我那么感激，说我是老吉姆在这个世界上最好的朋友，是他眼下唯一的一位朋友，想到这儿，我刚好转过头来，看到了那张纸。\n 　　这令我左右为难。我抓起它握在手里。我在发抖，因为我不得不在两者之间做出选择，绝不反悔，这我看得很清楚。我思考了一分钟，差点儿背过气去，然后，我对自己说：\"好吧，那么，下地狱就下地狱吧！\" 把纸撕掉了。这全是可怕的念头、可怕的话，可这句话还是说出来了。我说出话就得算数，再也不去想什么改过自新了。我把这件事全甩到了脑后，我又要走歪门邪道了，这才是我的老本行，我就是这么给教养大的，干不了什么正经事。而且一旦开始，我就一直干下去，一定得把吉姆再偷出来，叫他摆脱奴隶生活。如果因此要我去干什么更坏的事，我也去干，因为我一不做二不休，干脆就来个彻底痛快。\n 　　于是，我开始想如何才能达到目的，脑子里翻来覆去想了好多种办法，最后确定下来一个适宜于我做的计划。然后，我把大河下边一点儿那个长满树木的小岛细细打量了一番，等天一黑，我就划木排悄悄地出去，向小岛划去，到了那里，将木排藏了起来，我睡了一晚上，天亮之前醒了过来，吃过早饭，穿上我那身新衣服，把其他衣服和零碎东西打成个捆，坐着独木舟向岸上划。我在估计是斐尔普斯家的下游一些的地方靠了岸，将包藏入了树林中，把独木舟灌满水，装上石块，沉入水，等我需要时再找它，那是在河边上一个机器锯木厂下边半英里远的地方。\n 　　接着，我走上大路。从那个锯木厂经过时看到一个招牌，上面写着\"斐尔普斯锯木厂\"，我又朝前走了两三百码，走近农舍时，我不住地偷眼观看，虽然现在已天光大亮，周围却没有一个人。只是我也不在乎，因为我正好不想见人，我只是想把这一带地方摸清。按照我的计划，我打算从上面那个村庄走过来，而不是打下游朝这边走。于是我看了一下，就朝前走，一直往村里去。嘿，当我到了村口，我见到的第一个人竟会是公爵。他正在张贴告示：皇室奇物--上演三晚--和上次一样。他们可真是厚脸皮，这两骗子！我还没来得及躲，刚好撞上他。他神情惊讶，说道：\"你--好！你这是打哪儿来呀？\"然后，他装出高兴又关切的样子问道，\" 木排在哪儿？把它藏好啦？\"我说：\" 嘿，我还正想问阁下您呢。\"他显得不怎么高兴了，说道：\"你问（我），什么意思？\"他说。\n 　　\"是这样，\"我说，\" 昨天我在那个酒吧看见国王时，我就想，过几个小时我们也弄不回他去，得等他酒醒一些再说；于是我就在村中溜达，打发时间等会儿。一个人过来给了我一毛钱，让我帮他把船划过河，再顺便带只羊回来，我就跟着他去了，可我们把羊往船上拉的时候，那人让我一个人在前面拉住绳子，他要到羊后面去推，羊力气太大了，我拽不住，它挣脱绳子跑了，我们俩在后边追。我们又没有狗，所以就满地里跑着乱撵，一直把它累倒，到天黑才抓住它，然后又把它运过河来，我这才向木排走去。到了那里一瞅，木排不见了，我就想，他们俩闯了祸，一定会逃走。他们把我的奴隶带跑了，他可是我在这世上仅有的一个奴隶，我人在异地他乡，没有钱，没有东西，也没有办法谋生活命。\u0027因此我就坐在地上哭。我在林中睡了一夜。可是木排到底上哪儿去？还有吉姆，可怜的吉姆！\"\"（我）如果知道才怪呢！我是说，那木排的下落。那个老混蛋做了一笔生意赚了40 块钱，我们在酒吧找到他的时候，那群二流子跟他一赌半块钱，赢走了他的钱，只剩下付酒账的钱。昨天深夜我将他弄回去时，发觉木排不见了，我们说，\u0027那小坏蛋偷了我们的木排甩了我们，顺河逃走了。\u0027\"\"我不可能甩了我的（黑人），对不对？我在世界上就这一个黑人，他是我唯一的财产。\"\"我们根本不那么想。事实上，我认为我们已把他看成（我们的）黑人了；真的，我们确实这么认为的。天晓得，我们因为他实在是麻烦够了。所以，当我们看到木排不见了，我们又穷得身无分文，一点办法儿也没有，只得再拿皇室奇物试试看。从那时候起，我就四处乱逛，嘴干得像个火药桶。那一毛钱在哪儿？快点给我。\"我有不少钱，所以我就给了他一毛，央求他买些吃的东西，分给我一点，因为我身上就这么多钱，从昨天我开始什么都没吃着，他根本不说话。过了一会儿，他突然转向我说：\"你那个黑人会不会揭我们的老底儿？要是他那么做，我们就要扒他的皮！\"\"他怎么会揭老底儿？他不是逃走啦？\"\"没！那个老混蛋把他给卖了，没分给我一分钱，钱也花光了。\"\"他被你们给卖啦？\"我说完就哭起来，\" 啊，他是（我）的黑人，那是我的钱。他在哪里？我要我的黑人。\"\"好啦，你要不回来你的黑人，就这么着吧。所以，擦掉你的眼泪。听着，你想想看，你敢揭穿我们吗？我要是信了你才该死呢。呃，你要敢揭穿我们..\"他停住了，我过去可从没见过公爵的眼神这么凶恶。我还是一个劲儿地抽抽搭搭哭着说：\" 我不想揭穿任何人，我也没时间揭穿，也不知道怎么做。我得赶快去找我的黑人。\"他看上去有点心烦，站在那儿，告示在他手臂上飘动，他在用心思，皱着眉头。最后他说：\"我给你透点信儿。我们要在这里呆三天。如果你答应你不揭我们的老底儿，也不让那个黑人告我们，我就告诉你去哪里能找到他。\"于是我答应了，他这才说：\"一个农民名叫赛拉斯·斐--\"说到这儿，他停住了。你看得出他起初打算跟我说实话，但是，当他停下来又重新仔细想想的那个样子，我想他是改变了主意。果真是这样的。他不信我，他想让我整整三天都保证不妨碍他。所以很快，他又说：\" 那个买他的人叫阿兰布姆·福斯特--阿兰布姆·G·福斯特--他住在离这儿40 英里远的小乡村里，在往拉斐德去的路上。\"\"好吧，\"我说，\" 我得三天才会走到那儿。今天下午我就动身。\"\"不，你不行，你（现在）就动身，也别耽搁时间，路上也别跟人说话。嘴巴闭紧，一直朝前走，这样你就不会和（我们）搅在一起惹祸了，听到没？\"这正是我想听到的话，也正是我有意引他这样说的。我想不让人管我，照计划自己干。\n 　　\"所以赶快走，\"他说，\" 你想对福斯特先生说什么就说什么。或许你能叫他相信吉姆确是你的黑人--有些傻瓜不会要证件看--最起码我听说过南方这一带有号人。如果你告诉他那告示和赏金全是假的，你再给他说为什么要耍这些花招，也许他会相信你。去吧，想跟他说什么就说什么。不过得提醒你，在你离开这里以后到达那里之前，在路上嘴别乱动。\"于是我离开了，往村后头走去。我没回头看，但我感觉得出来他在盯着我。不过我知道我会让他盯个够的。我一直朝地里走了一英里远，才停了下来，然后照原路返回，穿过树林，往斐尔普斯家跑。我认为最好马上着手按计划行动，不要瞎转悠，因为我想早点堵住吉姆的嘴，等这些家伙走了再讲。我不想跟他们这路人找什么麻烦。我看够了他们的勾当，只想彻底甩掉他们。\n
