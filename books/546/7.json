{"id":41864,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"GIT up! What you \u0027bout?\" I opened my eyes and looked around, trying to make out where I was. It was after sun-up, and I had been sound asleep. Pap was standing over me looking sour補nd sick, too. He says: \"What you doin\u0027 with this gun?\" I judged he didn\u0027t know nothing about what he had been doing, so I says: \"Somebody tried to get in, so I was laying for him.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you roust me out?\" \"Well, I tried to, but I couldn\u0027t; I couldn\u0027t budge you.\" \"Well, all right. Don\u0027t stand there palavering all day, but out with you and see if there\u0027s a fish on the lines for breakfast. I\u0027ll be along in a minute.\" He unlocked the door, and I cleared out up the river-bank. I noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down, and a sprinkling of bark; so I knowed the river had begun to rise. I reckoned I would have great times now if I was over at the town. The June rise used to be always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts -- sometimes a dozen logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood-yards and the sawmill. I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t\u0027other one out for what the rise might fetch along. Well, all at once here comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck. I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. I just expected there\u0027d be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they\u0027d raise up and laugh at him. But it warn\u0027t so this time. It was a drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees this -- she\u0027s worth ten dollars. But when I got to shore pap wasn\u0027t in sight yet, and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another idea: I judged I\u0027d hide her good, and then, \u0027stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I\u0027d go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot. It was pretty close to the shanty, and I thought I heard the old man coming all the time; but I got her hid; and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows, and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun. So he hadn\u0027t seen anything. When he got along I was hard at it taking up a \"trot\" line. He abused me a little for being so slow; but I told him I fell in the river, and that was what made me so long. I knowed he would see I was wet, and then he would be asking questions. We got five catfish off the lines and went home. While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you see, all kinds of things might happen. Well, I didn\u0027t see no way for a while, but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water, and he says: \"Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out, you hear? That man warn\u0027t here for no good. I\u0027d a shot him. Next time you roust me out, you hear?\" Then he dropped down and went to sleep again; but what he had been saying give me the very idea I wanted. I says to myself, I can fix it now so nobody won\u0027t think of following me. About twelve o\u0027clock we turned out and went along up the bank. The river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the rise. By and by along comes part of a log raft -- nine logs fast together. We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore. Then we had dinner. Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch more stuff; but that warn\u0027t pap\u0027s style. Nine logs was enough for one time; he must shove right over to town and sell. So he locked me in and took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about halfpast three. I judged he wouldn\u0027t come back that night. I waited till I reckoned he had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that log again. Before he was t\u0027other side of the river I was out of the hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder. I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug. I took all the coffee and sugar there was, and all the ammunition; I took the wadding; I took the bucket and gourd; I took a dipper and a tin cup, and my old saw and two blankets, and the skillet and the coffee-pot. I took fish-lines and matches and other things -- everything that was worth a cent. I cleaned out the place. I wanted an axe, but there wasn\u0027t any, only the one out at the woodpile, and I knowed why I was going to leave that. I fetched out the gun, and now I was done. I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up at that place and didn\u0027t quite touch ground. If you stood four or five foot away and didn\u0027t know it was sawed, you wouldn\u0027t never notice it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn\u0027t likely anybody would go fooling around there. It was all grass clear to the canoe, so I hadn\u0027t left a track. I followed around to see. I stood on the bank and looked out over the river. All safe. So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods, and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp. I took the axe and smashed in the door. I beat it and hacked it considerable a-doing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground -- hard packed, and no boards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it -- all I could drag -- and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that. Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn\u0027t drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house. I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw, for there warn\u0027t no knives and forks on the place -- pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking. Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes -- and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away, I don\u0027t know where, but it didn\u0027t go to the river. The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I dropped pap\u0027s whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it wouldn\u0027t leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again. It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself, they\u0027ll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me. And they\u0027ll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things. They won\u0027t ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass. They\u0027ll soon get tired of that, and won\u0027t bother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want to. Jackson\u0027s Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there. And then I can paddle over to town nights, and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson\u0027s Island\u0027s the place. I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When I woke up I didn\u0027t know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and miles across. The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and SMELT late. You know what I mean -- I don\u0027t know the words to put it in. I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I made it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it\u0027s a still night. I peeped out through the willow branches, and there it was -- a skiff, away across the water. I couldn\u0027t tell how many was in it. It kept a-coming, and when it was abreast of me I see there warn\u0027t but one man in it. Think\u0027s I, maybe it\u0027s pap, though I warn\u0027t expecting him. He dropped below me with the current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water, and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him. Well, it WAS pap, sure enough -- and sober, too, by the way he laid his oars. I didn\u0027t lose no time. The next minute I was aspinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half, and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and people might see me and hail me. I got out amongst the driftwood, and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float. I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking away into the sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before. And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! I heard people talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too -- every word of it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now. T\u0027other one said THIS warn\u0027t one of the short ones, he reckoned -- and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn\u0027t laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said let him alone. The first fellow said he \u0027lowed to tell it to his old woman -- she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn\u0027t nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it was nearly three o\u0027clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn\u0027t wait more than about a week longer. After that the talk got further and further away, and I couldn\u0027t make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off. I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson\u0027s Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights. There warn\u0027t any signs of the bar at the head -- it was all under water now. It didn\u0027t take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside. I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town, three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling. A monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down, with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched it come creeping down, and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, \"Stern oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!\" I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side. 　　那地方离小屋很近，我总是觉得听到了老头儿来的脚步声。但是我还是藏好了小舟，然后才出去，在一堆柳树那儿四下张望，老头儿一个人正在小路上，拿枪瞄着一只小鸟，因此，他什么也没有看见。 　　他走过来的时候，我正费劲地朝上拖\"排钩\"鱼线。他骂了我两句，嫌我干得慢，我告诉他说我掉到河里了，这样耽误了我这么久。我知道他看得出来我的衣服湿了，然后，一定会问我。我们从鱼线上摘下五条鲇鱼，回家了。 　　吃完早饭，我们躺下来睡了一阵，两个人都累坏了，我就开始想，要是我能安排妥当，让爸和寡妇都不想去找我，那可就比凭运气跑出去老远才让他们发现我不见要稳妥得很。你知道吧，啥事都可能发生。不过，我一时还想不出办法。过了不一会儿，爸爬起来又喝了一罐水，他说：\"要是还有人贼头贼脑在这儿转，你就叫醒我，听到没有？那人来这里准不安好心。我想一枪把他干掉。下一次，你叫醒我，听到没有？\"然后，他倒下去，又睡了。可他刚才的话一下子使我有了主意。我想，现在我就要安排妥当，让谁都想不到要去找我。大概12 点的时候，我们出去沿着河岸朝上走。河水涨得很快，很多木头浮在水上往前漂。很快地，漂来一个散木排--九根木头牢牢地捆在一处。我们划着小船过去将它拖到岸上。然后我们就吃午饭。除了爸，谁都能等上一整天，再捞点东西，可是，那不是爸的干法儿。一次能捞上九根木头就足够了，他要马上运到镇上卖掉。因此，大约三点半时，他把我锁在小屋里，解开小船拖上木排划走了。我料定那天夜里他不会回来。我约摸着他开始用劲儿划的时候，我就拿出木锯又开始锯那根圆木。还没等他划到河对岸，我就从洞口钻出来了，他和他的小船在水面上远远看上去就剩下一个小黑点。 　　我提起那袋玉米面，把它提到我藏独木舟的地方，分开藤条柳枝，将玉米面放进小舟里，随后，又运来那块咸猪肉，又搬来那罐威士忌，我还拿来了全部的咖啡和糖，还有全部弹药；我又拿了垫东西的书报，拿了水桶和葫芦瓢，拿了一个长把勺和马口铁杯，另外还有我那把老锯和两张毯子，还有个平底煎锅和咖啡壶；我又带上鱼线儿和火柴，还有其他的东西--所有值点儿钱的东西。我把那地方都给搬空了。我想要把斧头，可是没有。只有外面的木材堆上有一把，我明白我为什么要留下那把斧头。我带上枪，这一来我算是拿彻底了。 　　我把那块地皮磨了不少，从洞口爬进爬出那多回，又拖出来那么多的东西。因此，我想办法要收拾好它，就从外面在那地方撒上土，把磨平的地皮和锯末都盖好。随后，我把那块木头又钉回原处，在它底下垫两块石头，又搬过来一块顶着将它固定住--因为木头在那个地方朝上弯，不是很贴地面。要是你站开四五英尺远，就看不出那地方被锯开过，你甚至都不会注意到，另外，那地方在小屋后墙，不大可能有人到那边傻转悠。 　　一直到独木舟那边都是草地，因此，我没有留下一点痕迹。我转到四周看看，站在岸上向河面上眺望，一切都好。于是，我拿起枪，一个人走进树林想去打几只鸟，这时，我看到一头野猪，猪从草地农场里跑出来以后，在低洼地里不久就跑野了。我打死这家伙，将它拖回住地。 　　我拿起那把斧，对准门乱劈一通。我连砍带砸，猛干了一阵。我把猪拖进来，让它差不多背靠桌子，用斧头砍断它的喉咙，把它放倒在地上给它放血。好了，接下来，我拿上条旧口袋，里面装入了很多大石块--我能拉动多少就朝里装多少--我从猪躺的地方拉到门口，又穿过树林，一直拖到河边，扔入水里，\" 扑通\"一声沉下去，就没影子了。你可以明显看到有什么东西拖过地面。我真希望汤姆·索亚在场，我知道，他向来有兴趣干这种事，而且还会添加许多新花样儿。干这种事谁也赶不上汤姆·索亚。 　　好了，最后，我从头上揪下一撮头发，用斧头蘸满血，把头发系到斧背上，把那把斧头扔到墙角。随后，我抱起那头猪，用上衣裹紧，抱在我的胸脯上(这么一来，它就不滴血了)，等我出房子走了好远一段路，就将它抛入了河中。现在，我想起了别的事。于是，我去把那袋玉米面和那把锯从独木舟里拿出来，拿到小屋里。我把袋子搁到老地方，用锯在面袋底部划开一道口，因为那里没有刀和叉子--爸做什么都用他的折刀，就连做饭也如此。然后，我扛起面袋，穿过草地走了一百码远，又穿过东面的柳树林，到了一个浅水湖边，湖有五英里宽，长了灯芯草，在这种季节，可以说满是鸭子。湖那一边有条小河流出去有几英里，我不知道它流向哪里，但是，它没有汇到大河里。玉米面漏出来，撒出小小的一溜印儿，一直到湖边。我把爸的磨刀石也撂在那里，为的是看起来好像是谁无意中那么做的。然后，我用一根绳子把裂口扎紧，不让它再向外漏，我扛起面袋，拿了锯子又回到独木舟上。 　　天快擦黑了，于是，我就在垂柳下把小舟荡到大河里，等着月亮升起来。我将小舟在一棵柳树上拴牢，接着随便吃了点东西，慢慢地在小舟上躺下，想想办法。我想，他们一定会沿着那袋石头拖出来的印儿一直找到河边，再下河里捞我。他们还可能沿着玉米面的痕迹到湖边，跟牛吃草一般低头顺着那条从湖里流出的小河一直找杀死了我又抢跑了东西的强盗。除去打捞我的死尸，他们在大河里啥也找不到。他们很快就会厌倦，不会再替我操心了。好了，我想停在哪儿就停在哪儿。杰克逊岛挺合适，我十分熟悉那个岛，从来没有人到过那里。然后，我就能划船到镇上，在夜里，偷偷摸摸转一圈儿，顺便捎带点我需要的东西。我就去杰克逊岛吧。 　　我被累坏了，迷迷糊糊地就睡着了。我醒来时，一开始还不知道自己身在何处。我坐起来四周看看，有点儿怕。后来，我就想起来了。大河好像有好多英里好多英里宽。月光很亮，我都可以数得清顺水漂下来的木头，黑乎乎的木头静静地漂着，离河岸有好几百码远。四周一片静寂，夜很晚，闻都闻得出来。你明白我要说什么--我不知道怎样表达。 　　我打了个大哈欠又伸个懒腰，正要解开绳子开船，我听见水面上远处有声音传来。我听了听，很快就听清了，那是在清静的夜里架在桨架上单调的划桨声。我穿过柳条偷眼一看，果然不错--有一只小船，在远远的水面上。我看不清船上到底有多少人。它一直向这边划过来，当它和我并齐成一条线时，我看清楚上面只有一个人。我想，或许是爸，尽管我没想到他会回来。他划到我下面去了，顺着主流，慢慢地在静水的地方靠岸。他离我这样近划了过去，我伸出枪就能碰到他。噢，是爸，一点没错--而且还没喝醉，要是从他那划桨的样子看的话。 　　我一点也不敢再耽误，立即沿着河岸的隐蔽处顺流急冲直下，尽管划得轻，可是速度相当快。我划出两英里半地，接着又向河中心划了四分之一英里多，因为很快我就会过渡口了，怕有人发现我，跟我打招呼。我从漂浮的木头的中划出去，在船底躺下来，让它随便漂。我躺在那里，美美地休息了一阵，用烟斗吸袋烟，看看远处的天，天下没有一丝云。在月光中，你躺着仰脸看天时，天空看起来那么深，我过去从不知道这个。在这样的夜里，你在水面上能听多远哪！我听到有人在渡口说话。我还能听见他们说什么，每个人都能听清楚。一个人说，现在快到天长夜短的时候了；另一个人说，在他的眼中，这一夜可不算短呢--这么一讲他们都笑了起来，他又说了一遍，他们又跟着笑。后来，他们唤醒另一个家伙，把这话告诉了他，又笑了一通，可是那家伙没笑，他狠狠地骂了一句，还说谁也别来招惹他。..我听到一个人说快三点了，他希望别等上一个星期，天才会亮。随后，说话声越来越远，我就听不清楚了，但是，我还能听见他们咕咕噜噜，偶尔也笑上两声，可是，好像是离得很远了。 　　我现在已经快到渡口了。我站起来一看，杰克逊岛就在前面，在下游大约有英里半远，林木丛生，兀起在大河中央，又大又黑又稳，像个没有灯的轮船。它前面的沙洲连影子都不见了--如今全给水淹没了。 　　很快地，我就到了。我飞快地冲过岛前头，那里水流湍急，然后，我划进静水里，靠上伊利诺斯州那边的河岸。我将独木舟划进一个我原来就知道的岸边，因为它凹进去很深，我得拨开柳条才能进去。我拴牢以后，从外面谁也不会看见那只独木舟。 　　我走上去，坐在岛头的一根木头上，朝着远处那条大河和那些黑乎乎的浮木头望去，望着远远的那座小镇，它在三英里开外，那儿有三四处灯光在闪亮。一个大得吓人的木排从大约一英里远的上游，向这边划过来，中间亮着灯。我眼睁睁看着慢慢爬过来，它快和我站的地方并齐时，我听见有人说，\" 划尾桨！嗨！船头向右！\" 我听得十分真切，好像那个人就在我身边。 　　这时，天光渐渐发亮了，我走进树林，躺下睡会儿，再吃早饭。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/71/3887.html","bookId":546,"book":{"id":546,"title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn哈克贝里·芬历险记","description":"简介： Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a book by Mark Twain, first published in England in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885.
