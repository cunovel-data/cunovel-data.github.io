{"id":41892,"no":35,"title":"Chapter 35","content":"IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast, so we left and struck down into the woods; because Tom said we got to have SOME light to see how to dig by, and a lantern makes too much, and might get us into trouble; what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that\u0027s called fox-fire, and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place. We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds, and set down to rest, and Tom says, kind of dissatisfied: \\n\\n \"Blame it, this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be. And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan. There ain\u0027t no watchman to be drugged -- now there OUGHT to be a watchman. There ain\u0027t even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to. And there\u0027s Jim chained by one leg, with a ten-foot chain, to the leg of his bed: why, all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain. And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody; sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger, and don\u0027t send nobody to watch the nigger. Jim could a got out of that windowhole before this, only there wouldn\u0027t be no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg. Why, drat it, Huck, it\u0027s the stupidest arrangement I ever see. You got to invent ALL the difficulties. Well, we can\u0027t help it; we got to do the best we can with the materials we\u0027ve got. Anyhow, there\u0027s one thing -- there\u0027s more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers, where there warn\u0027t one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them, and you had to contrive them all out of your own head. Now look at just that one thing of the lantern. When you come down to the cold facts, we simply got to LET ON that a lantern\u0027s resky. Why, we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to, I believe. Now, whilst I think of it, we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get.\" \\n\\n \"What do we want of a saw?\" \\n\\n \"What do we WANT of a saw? Hain\u0027t we got to saw the leg of Jim\u0027s bed off, so as to get the chain loose?\" \\n\\n \"Why, you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off.\" \\n\\n \"Well, if that ain\u0027t just like you, Huck Finn. You CAN get up the infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing. Why, hain\u0027t you ever read any books at all? -- Baron Trenck, nor Casanova, nor Benvenuto Chelleeny, nor Henri IV., nor none of them heroes? Who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an oldmaidy way as that? No; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two, and leave it just so, and swallow the sawdust, so it can\u0027t be found, and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal can\u0027t see no sign of it\u0027s being sawed, and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound. Then, the night you\u0027re ready, fetch the leg a kick, down she goes; slip off your chain, and there you are. Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements, shin down it, break your leg in the moat -- because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short, you know -- and there\u0027s your horses and your trusty vassles, and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle, and away you go to your native Langudoc, or Navarre, or wherever it is. It\u0027s gaudy, Huck. I wish there was a moat to this cabin. If we get time, the night of the escape, we\u0027ll dig one.\" \\n\\n I says: \\n\\n \"What do we want of a moat when we\u0027re going to snake him out from under the cabin?\" \\n\\n But he never heard me. He had forgot me and everything else. He had his chin in his hand, thinking. Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head; then sighs again, and says: \\n\\n \"No, it wouldn\u0027t do -- there ain\u0027t necessity enough for it.\" \\n\\n \"For what?\" I says. \\n\\n \"Why, to saw Jim\u0027s leg off,\" he says. \\n\\n \"Good land!\" I says; \"why, there ain\u0027t NO necessity for it. And what would you want to saw his leg off for, anyway?\" \\n\\n \"Well, some of the best authorities has done it. They couldn\u0027t get the chain off, so they just cut their hand off and shoved. And a leg would be better still. But we got to let that go. There ain\u0027t necessity enough in this case; and, besides, Jim\u0027s a nigger, and wouldn\u0027t understand the reasons for it, and how it\u0027s the custom in Europe; so we\u0027ll let it go. But there\u0027s one thing -- he can have a rope ladder; we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough. And we can send it to him in a pie; it\u0027s mostly done that way. And I\u0027ve et worse pies.\" \\n\\n \"Why, Tom Sawyer, how you talk,\" I says; \"Jim ain\u0027t got no use for a rope ladder.\" \\n\\n \"He HAS got use for it. How YOU talk, you better say; you don\u0027t know nothing about it. He\u0027s GOT to have a rope ladder; they all do.\" \\n\\n \"What in the nation can he DO with it?\" \\n\\n \"DO with it? He can hide it in his bed, can\u0027t he?\" That\u0027s what they all do; and HE\u0027S got to, too. Huck, you don\u0027t ever seem to want to do anything that\u0027s regular; you want to be starting something fresh all the time. S\u0027pose he DON\u0027T do nothing with it? ain\u0027t it there in his bed, for a clew, after he\u0027s gone? and don\u0027t you reckon they\u0027ll want clews? Of course they will. And you wouldn\u0027t leave them any? That would be a PRETTY howdy-do, WOULDN\u0027T it! I never heard of such a thing.\" \\n\\n \"Well,\" I says, \"if it\u0027s in the regulations, and he\u0027s got to have it, all right, let him have it; because I don\u0027t wish to go back on no regulations; but there\u0027s one thing, Tom Sawyer -- if we go to tearing up our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder, we\u0027re going to get into trouble with Aunt Sally, just as sure as you\u0027re born. Now, the way I look at it, a hickry-bark ladder don\u0027t cost nothing, and don\u0027t waste nothing, and is just as good to load up a pie with, and hide in a straw tick, as any rag ladder you can start; and as for Jim, he ain\u0027t had no experience, and so he don\u0027t care what kind of a --\" \\n\\n \"Oh, shucks, Huck Finn, if I was as ignorant as you I\u0027d keep still -- that\u0027s what I\u0027D do. Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickry-bark ladder? Why, it\u0027s perfectly ridiculous.\" \\n\\n \"Well, all right, Tom, fix it your own way; but if you\u0027ll take my advice, you\u0027ll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline.\" \\n\\n He said that would do. And that gave him another idea, and he says: \\n\\n \"Borrow a shirt, too.\" \\n\\n \"What do we want of a shirt, Tom?\" \\n\\n \"Want it for Jim to keep a journal on.\" \\n\\n \"Journal your granny -- JIM can\u0027t write.\" \\n\\n \"S\u0027pose he CAN\u0027T write -- he can make marks on the shirt, can\u0027t he, if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrelhoop?\" \\n\\n \"Why, Tom, we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one; and quicker, too.\" \\n\\n \"PRISONERS don\u0027t have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens out of, you muggins. They ALWAYS make their pens out of the hardest, toughest, troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on; and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out, too, because they\u0027ve got to do it by rubbing it on the wall. THEY wouldn\u0027t use a goose-quill if they had it. It ain\u0027t regular.\" \\n\\n \"Well, then, what\u0027ll we make him the ink out of?\" \\n\\n \"Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears; but that\u0027s the common sort and women; the best authorities uses their own blood. Jim can do that; and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he\u0027s captivated, he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window. The Iron Mask always done that, and it\u0027s a blame\u0027 good way, too.\" \\n\\n \"Jim ain\u0027t got no tin plates. They feed him in a pan.\" \\n\\n \"That ain\u0027t nothing; we can get him some.\" \\n\\n \"Can\u0027t nobody READ his plates.\" \\n\\n \"That ain\u0027t got anything to DO with it, Huck Finn. All HE\u0027S got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out. You don\u0027t HAVE to be able to read it. Why, half the time you can\u0027t read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate, or anywhere else.\" \\n\\n \"Well, then, what\u0027s the sense in wasting the plates?\" \\n\\n \"Why, blame it all, it ain\u0027t the PRISONER\u0027S plates.\" \\n\\n \"But it\u0027s SOMEBODY\u0027S plates, ain\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \"Well, spos\u0027n it is? What does the PRISONER care whose --\" \\n\\n He broke off there, because we heard the breakfasthorn blowing. So we cleared out for the house. \\n\\n Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothes-line; and I found an old sack and put them in it, and we went down and got the fox-fire, and put that in too. I called it borrowing, because that was what pap always called it; but Tom said it warn\u0027t borrowing, it was stealing. He said we was representing prisoners; and prisoners don\u0027t care how they get a thing so they get it, and nobody don\u0027t blame them for it, either. It ain\u0027t no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with, Tom said; it\u0027s his right; and so, as long as we was representing a prisoner, we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with. He said if we warn\u0027t prisoners it would be a very different thing, and nobody but a mean, ornery person would steal when he warn\u0027t a prisoner. So we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy. And yet he made a mighty fuss, one day, after that, when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it; and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for. Tom said that what he meant was, we could steal anything we NEEDED. Well, I says, I needed the watermelon. But he said I didn\u0027t need it to get out of prison with; there\u0027s where the difference was. He said if I\u0027d a wanted it to hide a knife in, and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with, it would a been all right. So I let it go at that, though I couldn\u0027t see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon. \\n\\n Well, as I was saying, we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business, and nobody in sight around the yard; then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch. By and by he come out, and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk. He says: \\n\\n \"Everything\u0027s all right now except tools; and that\u0027s easy fixed.\" \\n\\n \"Tools?\" I says. \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \"Tools for what?\" \\n\\n \"Why, to dig with. We ain\u0027t a-going to GNAW him out, are we?\" \\n\\n \"Ain\u0027t them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with?\" I says. \\n\\n He turns on me, looking pitying enough to make a body cry, and says: \\n\\n \"Huck Finn, did you EVER hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels, and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with? Now I want to ask you -- if you got any reasonableness in you at all -- what kind of a show would THAT give him to be a hero? Why, they might as well lend him the key and done with it. Picks and shovels -- why, they wouldn\u0027t furnish \u0027em to a king.\" \\n\\n \"Well, then,\" I says, \"if we don\u0027t want the picks and shovels, what do we want?\" \\n\\n \"A couple of case-knives.\" \\n\\n \"To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with?\" \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \"Confound it, it\u0027s foolish, Tom.\" \\n\\n \"It don\u0027t make no difference how foolish it is, it\u0027s the RIGHT way -- and it\u0027s the regular way. And there ain\u0027t no OTHER way, that ever I heard of, and I\u0027ve read all the books that gives any information about these things. They always dig out with a case-knife -- and not through dirt, mind you; generly it\u0027s through solid rock. And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks, and for ever and ever. Why, look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef, in the harbor of Marseilles, that dug himself out that way; how long was HE at it, you reckon?\" \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" \\n\\n \"Well, guess.\" \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. A month and a half.\" \\n\\n \"THIRTY-SEVEN YEAR -- and he come out in China. THAT\u0027S the kind. I wish the bottom of THIS fortress was solid rock.\" \\n\\n \"JIM don\u0027t know nobody in China.\" \\n\\n \"What\u0027s THAT got to do with it? Neither did that other fellow. But you\u0027re always a-wandering off on a side issue. Why can\u0027t you stick to the main point?\" \\n\\n \"All right -- I don\u0027t care where he comes out, so he COMES out; and Jim don\u0027t, either, I reckon. But there\u0027s one thing, anyway -- Jim\u0027s too old to be dug out with a case-knife. He won\u0027t last.\" \\n\\n \"Yes he will LAST, too. You don\u0027t reckon it\u0027s going to take thirty-seven years to dig out through a DIRT foundation, do you?\" \\n\\n \"How long will it take, Tom?\" \\n\\n \"Well, we can\u0027t resk being as long as we ought to, because it mayn\u0027t take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans. He\u0027ll hear Jim ain\u0027t from there. Then his next move will be to advertise Jim, or something like that. So we can\u0027t resk being as long digging him out as we ought to. By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years; but we can\u0027t. Things being so uncertain, what I recommend is this: that we really dig right in, as quick as we can; and after that, we can LET ON, to ourselves, that we was at it thirty-seven years. Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there\u0027s an alarm. Yes, I reckon that \u0027ll be the best way.\" \\n\\n \"Now, there\u0027s SENSE in that,\" I says. \"Letting on don\u0027t cost nothing; letting on ain\u0027t no trouble; and if it\u0027s any object, I don\u0027t mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year. It wouldn\u0027t strain me none, after I got my hand in. So I\u0027ll mosey along now, and smouch a couple of case-knives.\" \\n\\n \"Smouch three,\" he says; \"we want one to make a saw out of.\" \\n\\n \"Tom, if it ain\u0027t unregular and irreligious to sejest it,\" I says, \"there\u0027s an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the weather-boarding behind the smoke-house.\" \\n\\n He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like, and says: \\n\\n \"It ain\u0027t no use to try to learn you nothing, Huck. Run along and smouch the knives -- three of them.\" So I done it. \\n\\n 　　\"呃，锯掉吉姆的腿。\" 他说。\\n\\n 　　\"天哪！\" 我叫道，\" 喂，（根本没有）这个必要。是什么会让你想到要锯掉他的腿呢，啊？\"\"噢，某些最鼎鼎大名的人这样干过。他们去不掉链子，因此他们就把手吹断，逃掉。锯条腿自然更好。可我们得打消这主意。这一次的情况，没多大必要，再说，吉姆是个黑人，他不可能明白其中的缘由，也不明白这是欧洲的做法，因此，我们不想它了。不过，有件东西--他得有一条绳梯子。我们可以撕掉我们的床单，很容易就帮他做一条。我们还可以夹到馅饼里送给他；差不多会是这类做法。我吃过比这更难吃的馅饼。\"\"喂，汤姆·索亚，你这在说什么，\"我说，\" 吉姆要绳梯没用。\"\"他一定要用。你这是怎么说话的，你最好说你啥也不懂。他得有个绳梯，书里的人全有。\"\"他要那个到底能干嘛。\"\"干什么（用）？他能把它藏进他的床里头，对不对？这是他们所有人的做法，他也得这样做。哈克，你好像历来也不想按规矩办，你总想搞些新鲜玩意儿。就算他压根儿用不着它吧，那不也是在他的床上，在他逃走之后好提供线索吗？难道你不觉得他们都想找线索吗？他们当然想。那你就不给他们留点儿线索？这么做事儿可真绝，你说是不是！我可从没听说过这种做法。\"\"好吧，\"我说，\" 要有这种规矩，他非得有条绳梯不可，那也行，就让他有一条吧，因为我不想违背规矩。不过有一点，汤姆·索亚--要是我们把床单撕掉给吉姆做绳梯，我们就会在莎丽姨面前露馅，这一点毫无疑问。呃，我的想法是，用山核桃树皮做个梯子，不花钱，也不浪费东西，同样可以放在馅饼里头，藏到草垫下，跟你做的布梯子一个样，对吉姆来说，他也没这方面的经验，所以，他不在乎是哪一种--\"\"啊，瞎说，哈克·芬。要是我像你这样什么都不懂，我就会闭上自己的嘴，（我）就这么办。有谁听说过一个政治犯逃走时用的是一根核桃树皮做的梯子？咳，这真太可笑了。\"\"那好吧，汤姆，就按你的方法做。不过如果你听我的劝，你就让我打搭衣服的绳子上借条床单吧。\"他说那也可以，这又让他想到一个新主意：\"再借一件衬衣。\" 他说。\\n\\n 　　\"我们拿衬衣干吗？汤姆。\"\"让吉姆在上边写日记。\"\"日记？你奶奶，吉姆他连字也不会写。\"\"就算他（不会）写字。要是我们给他用一把旧锡汤匙或一块旧铁箍给他做支笔，他会在衬衣上做记号，对不对？\"\"咳，汤姆，我们可以从鹅身上拔根毛给他做一支更好使的笔，写得更快。\"\"（囚犯）身边可没鹅到处跑能让他拔下毛来当笔呀，你这傻瓜。他们做笔用的都是最坚硬、最费劲、最不好使的旧铜蜡台之类的，他们手边可能有的东西。他们还得花上几个星期几个月才会把它磨好，因为他们拿它朝墙上擦。即使有鹅毛笔，（他们）也不会用。那不合规矩。\"\"那好，我们用什么给他当墨水呢？\"\"好多人用铁锈和眼泪做墨水，不过那是普通人跟女人的办法，最权威的人拿他们自己的血。吉姆可以用这个办法，他要想传出些普普通通的神秘消息，让外边的人知道他在哪儿关着，他就可以拿吃饭的叉子写在铁盘子底下，把它扔到窗外。那个铁面人总这么做，那可真他妈的是个好法子。\"\"吉姆没铁盘子。他们拿锅给他送饭。\"\"那算不了什么，我们可以给他送几个。\"\"有人会（认识）他写在铁盘子上的字吗？\"\"认不认识没什么关系，哈克·芬。他要做的就是写在盘子上扔出去。你（没有必要）非认识不可。咳，犯人在铁盘子或其他东西上写的字有大半是谁也不认识。\"\"那么，干嘛还要浪费那些盘子呢？\"\"咳，真混蛋，那不是（犯人）的盘子。\"\"可那些盘子总该（有主儿）吧，对吧？\"\"好，就算是有主儿又怎么样？犯人干吗还管那是谁的..\"他说到这儿停住了，因为我们听到开早饭的号吹响了。于是，我们赶快往家跑。\\n\\n 　　那天上午，我打晒衣服绳上借了条床单，一件白衬衣，我又找了个旧袋子装了进去，我们出门到了鬼火木头那儿，也给装了进去。我把这叫借，因为爸老这么叫，可是汤姆说这不是借，是偷。他说我们现在代表犯人，犯人可不管他们是如何拿到一件东西的，反正他们拿了，也没人去责怪他们。犯人逃跑时偷他需要的东西没罪，汤姆说，那是他的正当权利。因此，只要我们是代表犯人的，我们就有十足的权利在这块地方偷对我们自己能逃离监牢稍稍有些用处的东西。他说，要我们不是犯人，那就不一样了。所以，我们认为我们可以偷手头方便的任何东西。可是后来有一天，我从黑人地里偷了个西瓜吃，他却大惊小怪了好一会儿，非要叫我去给了那些黑人一毛钱，又不对他们说明原因。汤姆说，他的意思是说，我们能偷凡是我们（需要）的东西。那好了，我就说，我需要那个西瓜。可他说，我不是为逃离监狱才需要西瓜的，这就不同了。他说，如果我需要将一把刀子藏入西瓜里，偷偷带给吉姆，让他用来杀掉那个监狱看守，那还可以。如果每次我看到机会能顺手摸人家个西瓜的时候，我都得坐下来像这样仔细琢磨这许多很小的差别，那我可看不到我代表犯人有什么好处，于是，我就不再想这事儿了。\\n\\n 　　好啦，书归正传。那天上午，我们等大家各司其职干活去了，院子里看不到一个人，这时，汤姆背着那个袋子进了斜棚，我站在不远处放哨。一阵子之后，他就出来了，我们坐到木头堆上开始讨论。他说：\"现在一切就绪，光差工具了，不过那也很好办。\"\"工具？\"我问。\\n\\n 　　\"是呀。\"\"要工具干嘛？\"\"挖洞用啊。我们总不至于把他啃出来，对不对？\"\"那些破旧的坏铁镐之类的拿来给一个黑人挖洞，救他出来，不是很好吗？\"他转向我，脸上那表情简直是可怜我，让人看了直想哭，他说：\"哈克·芬，你听到过一个犯人有镐和铁锨，以及所有这些现代设备在他橱柜里搁着，让他自己挖洞用吗？眼下我想问你--如果你脑子里还有些理性的话--如果那么做，他还有什么机会能出风头当英雄呢？啊，这或许还不如就借给他钥匙，开锁放人的为好。镐和锨，就是个国王，他们也不会给他这些东西。\"\"好吧，\"我说，\" 要是我们不想要那些铁镐铁锨，我们要什么？\"\"两把餐刀。\"\"在那个小屋墙角底下挖洞，就拿它？\"\"对。\"\"混蛋，那简直是傻瓜，汤姆。\"\"不管怎么傻，都没关系，那全是正经办法，也是合乎规矩的办法。就（我）所听过的而言，没有另外别的什么办法。我读到所有提到过这类事情的书，他们全是用一把餐刀挖洞出来，还不是打土里挖，跟你说吧，大部分是挖透坚固的岩石。那能让他们挖上好多好多星期，挖个没完没了。啊，你瞧瞧关在马赛港狄福堡地牢里的一个犯人吧，他就是那么挖洞自己逃出来的，他挖了多久，你猜猜？\"\"我不知道。\"\"嘿，猜猜嘛。\"\"我不知道。一个半月？\"\"三七年！他打中国钻出来了。那才叫有本事。我希望这个堡垒底下也是坚硬的岩石。\"\"吉姆在中国可谁也不认识。\"\"那又有什么关系？那个家伙也不认识。可你总把问题岔到次要方面。你为什么总不能抓住要点呢？\"\"好吧，（我）不管他从哪里出来，只要他（出来）就行，我看吉姆也不会在乎。不过，还是有个问题，吉姆年岁太大，拿餐刀挖洞他出不来。他活不了那么长。\"\"他能活得了。你认为从土墙脚下面挖洞在不了37 年吧，对不对？\"\"得用多久，汤姆？\"\"啊，我们本来得挖得很长时间，可是，我们不能冒这个险，因为用不了很久，塞拉斯姨父就会收到新奥尔良那边的信。他可以打信上知道吉姆不是从那里来的。这样，他下一步要做的事就是登广告招领吉姆，或者这一类事。所以，我们不敢冒险，不能像我们应该的那样很长时间才把他挖了来。照正理，我认为我们得用两三年，可是我们不能那样做。事情这么捉摸不定，我的主张是这样：我们立刻动手挖，越快越好，挖完之后，我们自己可以装假，权当是我们挖了37 年。等到一有风声，我们就拉他出来，带他跑掉。对，我认为这就是最理想的办法。\"\"嗯，这还有点儿道理，\"我说，\" 装假又不花钱，也不费事，要有必要，即使是我们装假干了150 年我也不在乎。这一点都不会让我觉得勉强，只需我玩惯了这一套。我现在就赶紧去，盗两把餐刀回来。\"\"盗三把，\"他说，\" 我们用一把做锯子。\"\"汤姆，我提一提，不知合不合规矩，犯不犯忌讳，\"我说，\" 熏肉小屋后面的护墙板底下，插着一根生锈的旧锯条。\"他看上去极不耐烦，又有点灰心丧气。他说道：\"想教你干个啥事儿，几乎是白费劲，哈克。快去把刀盗来--要三把。\" 我赶紧一一照办。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/71/3915.html","bookId":546,"book":{"id":546,"title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn哈克贝里·芬历险记","description":"简介： Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a book by Mark Twain, first published in England in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885.
