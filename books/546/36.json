{"id":41893,"no":36,"title":"Chapter 36","content":"AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightning-rod, and shut ourselves up in the lean-to, and got out our pile of fox-fire, and went to work. We cleared everything out of the way, about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log. Tom said we was right behind Jim\u0027s bed now, and we\u0027d dig in under it, and when we got through there couldn\u0027t nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there, because Jim\u0027s counterpin hung down most to the ground, and you\u0027d have to raise it up and look under to see the hole. So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight; and then we was dog-tired, and our hands was blistered, and yet you couldn\u0027t see we\u0027d done anything hardly. At last I says: \"This ain\u0027t no thirty-seven year job; this is a thirty-eight year job, Tom Sawyer.\" He never said nothing. But he sighed, and pretty soon he stopped digging, and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking. Then he says: \"It ain\u0027t no use, Huck, it ain\u0027t a-going to work. If we was prisoners it would, because then we\u0027d have as many years as we wanted, and no hurry; and we wouldn\u0027t get but a few minutes to dig, every day, while they was changing watches, and so our hands wouldn\u0027t get blistered, and we could keep it up right along, year in and year out, and do it right, and the way it ought to be done. But WE can\u0027t fool along; we got to rush; we ain\u0027t got no time to spare. If we was to put in another night this way we\u0027d have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well -- couldn\u0027t touch a case-knife with them sooner.\" \"Well, then, what we going to do, Tom?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you. It ain\u0027t right, and it ain\u0027t moral, . and I wouldn\u0027t like it to get out; but there ain\u0027t only just the one way: we got to dig him out with the picks, and LET ON it\u0027s case-knives.\" \"NOW you\u0027re TALKING!\" I says; \"your head gets leveler and leveler all the time, Tom Sawyer,\" I says. \"Picks is the thing, moral or no moral; and as for me, I don\u0027t care shucks for the morality of it, nohow. When I start in to steal a nigger, or a watermelon, or a Sunday-school book, I ain\u0027t no ways particular how it\u0027s done so it\u0027s done. What I want is my nigger; or what I want is my watermelon; or what I want is my Sunday-school book; and if a pick\u0027s the handiest thing, that\u0027s the thing I\u0027m a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with; and I don\u0027t give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther.\" \"Well,\" he says, \"there\u0027s excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like this; if it warn\u0027t so, I wouldn\u0027t approve of it, nor I wouldn\u0027t stand by and see the rules broke -- because right is right, and wrong is wrong, and a body ain\u0027t got no business doing wrong when he ain\u0027t ignorant and knows better. It might answer for YOU to dig Jim out with a pick, WITHOUT any letting on, because you don\u0027t know no better; but it wouldn\u0027t for me, because I do know better. Gimme a case-knife.\" He had his own by him, but I handed him mine. He flung it down, and says: \"Gimme a CASE-KNIFE.\" I didn\u0027t know just what to do -- but then I thought. I scratched around amongst the old tools, and got a pickaxe and give it to him, and he took it and went to work, and never said a word. He was always just that particular. Full of principle. So then I got a shovel, and then we picked and shoveled, turn about, and made the fur fly. We stuck to it about a half an hour, which was as long as we could stand up; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it. When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his level best with the lightning-rod, but he couldn\u0027t come it, his hands was so sore. At last he says: \"It ain\u0027t no use, it can\u0027t be done. What you reckon I better do? Can\u0027t you think of no way?\" \"Yes,\" I says, \"but I reckon it ain\u0027t regular. Come up the stairs, and let on it\u0027s a lightning-rod.\" So he done it. Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house, for to make some pens for Jim out of, and six tallow candles; and I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance, and stole three tin plates. Tom says it wasn\u0027t enough; but I said nobody wouldn\u0027t ever see the plates that Jim throwed out, because they\u0027d fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole -- then we could tote them back and he could use them over again. So Tom was satisfied. Then he says: \"Now, the thing to study out is, how to get the things to Jim.\" \"Take them in through the hole,\" I says, \"when we get it done.\" He only just looked scornful, and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea, and then he went to studying. By and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways, but there warn\u0027t no need to decide on any of them yet. Said we\u0027d got to post Jim first. That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten, and took one of the candles along, and listened under the window-hole, and heard Jim snoring; so we pitched it in, and it didn\u0027t wake him. Then we whirled in with the pick and shovel, and in about two hours and a half the job was done. We crept in under Jim\u0027s bed and into the cabin, and pawed around and found the candle and lit it, and stood over Jim awhile, and found him looking hearty and healthy, and then we woke him up gentle and gradual. He was so glad to see us he most cried; and called us honey, and all the pet names he could think of; and was for having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away, and clearing out without losing any time. But Tom he showed him how unregular it would be, and set down and told him all about our plans, and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm; and not to be the least afraid, because we would see he got away, SURE. So Jim he said it was all right, and we set there and talked over old times awhile, and then Tom asked a lot of questions, and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him, and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat, and both of them was kind as they could be, Tom says: \"NOW I know how to fix it. We\u0027ll send you some things by them.\" I said, \"Don\u0027t do nothing of the kind; it\u0027s one of the most jackass ideas I ever struck;\" but he never paid no attention to me; went right on. It was his way when he\u0027d got his plans set. So he told Jim how we\u0027d have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other large things by Nat, the nigger that fed him, and he must be on the lookout, and not be surprised, and not let Nat see him open them; and we would put small things in uncle\u0027s coatpockets and he must steal them out; and we would tie things to aunt\u0027s apron-strings or put them in her apron-pocket, if we got a chance; and told him what they would be and what they was for. And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood, and all that. He told him everything. Jim he couldn\u0027t see no sense in the most of it, but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him; so he was satisfied, and said he would do it all just as Tom said. Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco; so we had a right down good sociable time; then we crawled out through the hole, and so home to bed, with hands that looked like they\u0027d been chawed. Tom was in high spirits. He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life, and the most intellectural; and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to get out; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it. He said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year, and would be the best time on record. And he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it. In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes, and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket. Then we went to the nigger cabins, and while I got Nat\u0027s notice off, Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn-pone that was in Jim\u0027s pan, and we went along with Nat to see how it would work, and it just worked noble; when Jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out; and there warn\u0027t ever anything could a worked better. Tom said so himself. Jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that\u0027s always getting into bread, you know; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first. And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light, here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim\u0027s bed; and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them, and there warn\u0027t hardly room in there to get your breath. By jings, we forgot to fasten that lean-to door! The nigger Nat he only just hollered \"Witches\" once, and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs, and begun to groan like he was dying. Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim\u0027s meat, and the dogs went for it, and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door, and I knowed he\u0027d fixed the other door too. Then he went to work on the nigger, coaxing him and petting him, and asking him if he\u0027d been imagining he saw something again. He raised up, and blinked his eyes around, and says: \"Mars Sid, you\u0027ll say I\u0027s a fool, but if I didn\u0027t b\u0027lieve I see most a million dogs, er devils, er some\u0027n, I wisht I may die right heah in dese tracks. I did, mos\u0027 sholy. Mars Sid, I FELT um -- I FELT um, sah; dey was all over me. Dad fetch it, I jis\u0027 wisht I could git my han\u0027s on one er dem witches jis\u0027 wunst -- on\u0027y jis\u0027 wunst -- it\u0027s all I\u0027d ast. But mos\u0027ly I wisht dey\u0027d lemme \u0027lone, I does.\" Tom says: \"Well, I tell you what I think. What makes them come here just at this runaway nigger\u0027s breakfast-time? It\u0027s because they\u0027re hungry; that\u0027s the reason. You make them a witch pie; that\u0027s the thing for YOU to do.\" \"But my lan\u0027, Mars Sid, how\u0027s I gwyne to make \u0027m a witch pie? I doan\u0027 know how to make it. I hain\u0027t ever hearn er sich a thing b\u0027fo\u0027.\" \"Well, then, I\u0027ll have to make it myself.\" \"Will you do it, honey? -- 褀ill you? I\u0027ll wusshup de groun\u0027 und\u0027 yo\u0027 foot, I will!\" \"All right, I\u0027ll do it, seeing it\u0027s you, and you\u0027ve been good to us and showed us the runaway nigger. But you got to be mighty careful. When we come around, you turn your back; and then whatever we\u0027ve put in the pan, don\u0027t you let on you see it at all. And don\u0027t you look when Jim unloads the pan -- something might happen, I don\u0027t know what. And above all, don\u0027t you HANDLE the witch-things.\" \"HANNEL \u0027m, Mars Sid? What IS you a-talkin\u0027 \u0027bout? I wouldn\u0027 lay de weight er my finger on um, not f\u0027r ten hund\u0027d thous\u0027n billion dollars, I wouldn\u0027t.\" 　　他总那样挑剔，时时讲原则。 　　这样，我又找出把铁锨，然后，我们俩一个挖，一个铲，忙得团团转，干得尘土飞扬。我们干了大约有半个小时，就再也坚持不下去了，不过，我们挖得已经挺像个洞的样子了。我上了楼，向窗外看，见汤姆正跟避雷针较劲儿，但是他上不来，他的手臂酸痛得厉害。最后他说：\"没用，上不去。你说我该如何做，你能不能想个办法？\"\"能啊，\"我说，\" 不过我觉得这不大合规矩。从楼梯上来，假装那是避雷针。\"他就这样做了。 　　第二天，汤姆从屋里偷了把锡匙和一个铜蜡台，拿来给吉姆做笔，还偷了六根蜡烛。我到黑人小屋附近四处转悠，瞅准机会，偷走三个铁盘子。汤姆说不够，不过我说没人会看到吉姆扔出来的盘子，因为它们会落到窗口下的草丛中--然后我们再给捡回来，他能重复使用。这样，汤姆满意了。然后他说：\"现在得解决的问题是，怎样才能把东西送给吉姆。\"\"等我们挖好洞，\"我说，\" 把东西从洞里送过去。\"他只瞅了我一眼，显出一副瞧不起人的样子，说了句：没人听说这种愚蠢到底的主意。然后就接着想办法。过了一会儿，他说他想出两三个办法，不过暂时不忙着决定用哪个。他说我们首先得把消息告诉吉姆。 　　那天夜里，十点刚过，我们爬下避雷针，带只蜡烛，到窗下听了听，听到吉姆在打呼噜，于是我们把蜡烛扔了进去，可它未惊醒吉姆。我们又拿出铁锨跟镐拼命挖，干了约两个半小时，洞挖妥了。我们钻进去爬到吉姆床底下，进了小屋，胡乱摸了一会儿，找到那根蜡烛点着，在吉姆身边站了会儿，看他那样，结实又健壮，然后我们轻轻地慢慢地叫醒他。见到我们，他高兴得要哭了，叫我们心肝宝贝儿，他想到什么亲热就叫我们什么，他让我们尽快找把凿子把他腿上的链子砍断，立刻逃走，一刻也不耽误。可是，汤姆对他讲这么做不合规矩，又坐下来告诉他我们的所有计划，还说有紧急情况我们会如何随时更改，让吉姆一点儿也别怕，因为我们绝对会保证让他逃走。因此吉姆说那就好，我们坐在那儿聊了一些过去的事情，汤姆又问了好多问题，当吉姆告诉他赛拉斯姨父一两天来一回，陪他做祷告，莎丽姨也过来看他是不是过得还顺心，吃得饱不饱，两人对他都好得没话说，汤姆说：\"现在我知道怎么做了。我们要通过他们给你一些东西。\"我说，\" 别做这事，这是我见的最笨的主意。\" 可是他一点儿也不听我的，只一个劲儿自己说。他一旦打定了主意，总这样。 　　他还告诉吉姆他得让那个给他送饭的黑人纳特将装绳梯的馅饼与其他一些大东西偷偷带给他，让他千万留神，别大惊小怪，别让纳特看着打开那些东西，我们还得把小东西放在姨父上衣的口袋里，他得给偷出来，要有机会的话，我们也会把东西系到姨的围裙带子上或者放在她围裙口袋里；还告诉了他是些什么东西，都是做什么用的。又告诉他怎么拿他的血在衬衣上写日记，等等。汤姆跟他讲了全部的打算，吉姆绝大部分都不明白其中的道理，不过他认为我们是白人，懂得比他多，因此他乐于接受，他说他完全按汤姆的吩咐办。 　　吉姆有足够的玉米重穗烟斗和烟草，因此我们聊得很愉快，然后我们爬出洞去，进屋里睡觉，两只手看起像被什么啃过一般。汤姆的兴致很高，他说这是他这辈子碰上的最开心的事儿，也是最动脑筋的一回，他说他要能想出个方法就好了，让我们自此往后一辈子都能玩下去，把吉姆留给我们的后辈营救出去；因为他相信吉姆对这一套越习惯，就会越喜欢。他说这么下去，这件事儿就可以拖上80 年，就会成为有史以来最风光的一件事。他还说这会让我们所有参加过的人全出名。 　　早上，我们跑到木头堆那儿把铜蜡台截成长短合适的几截，汤姆把它们跟汤匙都放在口袋里。然后，我们朝黑人的木屋走去。我引开纳特的注意力，汤姆借机反一截蜡台塞进吉姆锅里的一个纯玉米面包里，我们跟纳特一道去看结果地如何，果然了不起，吉姆咬着吃的时候，险些把他的牙全给硌掉，这可真是没啥能比得上的结果。汤姆自己也这样说。你知道，他一点没露出真情，只说是块石子什么的面包里常有的东西，不过打那次以后，他吃什么东西都要先拿叉子往里戳三四下才敢于张口。 　　我们正站在昏暗的光线里，有两条狗打吉姆的床下钻出来了，不断钻进来11 条狗，屋里连个透气的地方都没有。糟糕，我们忘了关严那个斜棚的门了。那个黑人纳特只大喊了一声\"妖魔！\" 就在地上双膝跪倒在狗中间开始呻吟，人像快死了一般，汤姆猛地将门推开，扔出一块吉姆吃的肉，狗抢肉去了，没花两秒，汤姆出去又回来，关好门，我知道他将另一扇门也关好了。然后他开始糊弄那个黑人，拿好话哄他，冲他亲热，问他是不是又看见什么幻觉了。他站起来，四个里眨眨眼睛，说：\"席德少爷，你会说我是个傻子，不过如果我不相信我看到了几乎有一百万条狗，要不就是鬼或别的什么，我宁愿当场死掉，千真万确，一点没错。席德少爷，我摸着它们了，我摸着它们了，您哪，它们围在我周围。他娘的，我真想用手抓住一回妖怪，就抓这一回，我就心满意足了。不过我总还想让它们别缠我，我真这么想。\"汤姆说：\" 好吧，我告诉你（我）怎么想的。在这个逃跑黑人刚好在吃早饭之时它们来这里干什么？这是由于它们饿了，这就是原因。你给它们做个妖魔饼吧，这才是（你）该干的事情。\"\"可天哪，席德少爷，我怎么能给它们做妖魔饼呢？我不知道怎么做。我过去也没听说过这种东西。\"\"那样的话，我只得自己做了。\"\"您给做吗？宝贝？您给做？我可要跪到您脚下了，我一定跪！\"\"好啦，看到你的份儿上，你一向待我们挺好，还领我们看这个逃跑黑人。不过你得特别小心。我们来的时候，你背过身去，然后，不管我们在锅内放什么，你都假装根本没看到。吉姆从锅里拿东西时你千万别看，很容易出事儿，我不知道到底会出什么事儿。最关键的是，你别摸妖魔的东西。\"\"（摸）它们的东西，席德少爷？您（这是）说的什么话？我连手指头尖儿都不会去碰它，就算是给我成千上万块钱，我也不。\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/71/3916.html","bookId":546,"book":{"id":546,"title":"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn哈克贝里·芬历险记","description":"简介： Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a book by Mark Twain, first published in England in December 1884 and in the United States in February 1885.
