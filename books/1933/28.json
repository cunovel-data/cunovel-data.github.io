I’d take a leisurely stroll along the waterfront.”\n “And after that?”\n “I’d knit.” I remember how astonished my father had seemed when I told him that. He shouldn’t have been. By that time I’d been knitting for years. I remembered how my wanting to knit—seeing it as a perfect part of my perfect day—bothered him. Knitting, in his eyes, was such a solitary activity that I’d soon become a recluse.\n “Knitting in your own store?” Brad murmured.\n “Sort of.” One of the things I love most about being a knitter is the community of other knitters. Anytime I run into another person (usually a woman but not always) who knits, it’s like finding a long-lost friend. The two of us instantly connect. It doesn’t matter that only seconds earlier we were strangers, because we immediately share a common bond. I’d talked to other knitters in doctors’ offices, in line-ups at the grocery store—anywhere at all. We’ve exchanged horror stories of misprinted instructions and uncompleted projects. And we all loved to brag about fabulous yarn buys and, of course, discuss our current efforts.\n “I wanted to help people discover the same sense of satisfaction and pride that I feel when I finish a project for someone I love.” That was the best way to describe it, I thought.\n “How would you end your perfect day?”\n “With music and champagne and candlelight,” I said shyly, which was only partially true. I’d told my dad I wanted to end the day dancing.\n My father had told me I’d have that perfect day. What neither of us knew was that he wouldn’t be there to enjoy it with me.\n “What’s wrong?” Brad asked, watching me.\n I shook my head. “I was just thinking about how much I miss my father.”\n To my surprise, Brad reached across the table and squeezed my hand. “You’ve had a rough time of it, haven’t you?”\n I bristled. I didn’t want his sympathy or his pity. What I yearned for more than anything was to be normal. One of my biggest fears was that I could no longer recognize what normal was.\n “Cancer is part of who I am, but it isn’t everything. I’m in remission today but I can’t speak for tomorrow or next week. I was in a holding pattern for most of my twenties but I’m beyond that now. It wasn’t just the doctors or the medicine or the surgery that saved me, especially since I’d died emotionally when I learned the cancer had returned.” I took a deep breath. “My father refused to let me give up, and when I discovered knitting, I felt like I’d found the Holy Grail because it was something I could do by myself. I could do it lying in bed if I had to. It was a way of proving I was more than a victim.”\n Brad’s eyes grew somber and I think he really heard me.\n “Anything else you want to ask me?” I sat up straighter, prepared to back off now.\n A grin lifted the corners of his mouth. “How come it took you so long to say yes to a beer with me?”\n “Relationships aren’t part of my perfect day,” I teased, although that was far from the truth.\n “No, seriously, I want to know.”\n Mostly I’d been afraid of rejection, I guess. But all I said was, “I’m not sure.”\n “Are you willing to go out with me again?” His eyes held mine.\n I nodded.\n “Good, because I only have a few more minutes and I want us to get to know each other.”\n We talked for a little while longer, and I finally had the opportunity to ask him some personal questions, mainly about his marriage and his son.\n Forty minutes later, I parked in front of Margaret and Matt’s house. I realized I’ve never shown up at my sister’s home without an invitation. Come to think of it, I don’t think she’s ever actually invited me—and yet here I was, so excited I couldn’t hold still. I was dying to talk to someone, and since my sister had practically forced me into this, I figured she should be that someone.\n I rang the doorbell and then stepped back, half afraid she wouldn’t ask me in. It was Hailey who answered. When she saw me, she shrieked with happiness—and left me standing on the porch while she ran to get her mother.\n “Lydia.” Margaret burst into the room and stood on the other side of the closed screen door. “It is you.”\n “I told you it was,” Hailey said from behind her mother.\n My sister unlocked the screen door and held it open for me.\n “I don’t usually drop by unannounced,” I said, “but I just had to tell you about my meeting with Brad.”\n “Oh, my goodness, that was tonight.” My sister’s eyes lit up as she pulled me into the house. Before I could comprehend what was going on, she had me sitting at the kitchen table and was on a stepstool in front of the refrigerator, standing on tiptoe as she removed a liquor bottle from the cabinet above.\n “What are you doing?” I asked, almost giddy.\n “A night like this calls for homemade margaritas.” She had a bottle in each hand—one of tequila and one of cointreau.\n I giggled like a schoolgirl. Hailey dug into the freezer portion of the refrigerator for ice cubes while Margaret found limes, then brought out the blender and special glasses.\n In a matter of minutes, my sister had mixed the drinks and dipped the rims of both glasses in salt; she’d also made a virgin drink for Hailey, something involving ginger ale and fruit juice.\n “Where are Matt and Julia?” I asked.\n “Bonding at a baseball game,” Margaret explained, handing me my glass. “Now tell all.”\n After two beers and now sipping a mixed drink, I wasn’t sure where to start. “I met Brad at The Pour House.” Both my sister and Hailey drew closer. “He had less than an hour because he had to pick up his son from day care.” If not for that, I had the feeling we could have spent half the night talking.\n “He’s paying extra time at day care on a Friday night?” Margaret asked.\n I nodded.\n “You can bet he paid through the nose for that.”\n “He didn’t say.” I looked from my sister to my niece who hung on every word.\n “What did he say?”\n “Not much. He asked a lot of questions but he didn’t talk much about himself. Mostly he talked about his son.”\n Margaret shrugged as if that didn’t impress her half as much as his paying extra charges at the day care center. “What did he have to say about his ex-wife?”\n I had to think about that for a moment, which gave me time to take another sip of the margarita. My sister possessed talents I would never have suspected. For one thing, this was the best margarita I’d had in years.\n “Mostly he glossed over the divorce. They were too young and she decided she didn’t want to be married or responsible for a child. Not once in the entire conversation did Brad say anything negative or derogatory about Cody’s mother.”\n Margaret smiled. “I like him, you know.”\n So did I, but I was cautious. And nervous.\n “You told him about having cancer?” my niece asked.\n I nodded. “I felt it was only fair.”\n “Are you going to see him again?” Margaret’s gaze was sharp.\n “Yes.” I took another sip of my drink. “One more of these margaritas, and I’d probably be willing to marry him.”\n My sister broke into peals of laughter. I can’t remember ever seeing Margaret this pleased with me and, silly as it sounds, I basked in her approval.\n CHAPTER 27\n JACQUELINE DONOVAN\n “I s everything all right with you and Reese?” Tammie Lee asked as she began clearing the dining room table.\n Jacqueline sighed and pretended not to hear the question. She’d hoped no one had noticed the tension between her and Reese during tonight’s dinner party. The mayor and two city council members had been in attendance, along with their wives and three other couples.\n At the last minute, not bothering to check with Jacqueline, Reese had invited Paul and Tammie Lee. Having Paul there was, of course, perfect, but Jacqueline had cringed at the prospect of her daughter-in-law sharing her unsophisticated sense of humor with members of the city government. Well, there was nothing Jacqueline could do about it.\n Thankfully, the evening had gone surprisingly well, with only one minor glitch. The mayor had asked Tammie Lee her opinion of the country club. Without a pause Tammie Lee said in her heavy southern twang that it was nothing but tennis and bridge, dining and whining. After a second’s pause, during which Jacqueline wanted to slink away and die, the mayor laughed uproariously. He said it was the most honest thing anyone had ever said to him. Jacqueline wasn’t sure whether he actually meant it or was just being a good guest.\n Reese had glared across the dinner table at Jacqueline, as if to tell her how wrong she was about Tammie Lee. And how right he was.\n The invitation to their son and his wife wasn’t the crux of their most recent argument, however. Jacqueline and Reese rarely argued; there was no reason for it. But Reese had exploded when he learned she’d been accosted and nearly mugged by those two creeps. Thank goodness both had been apprehended and arraigned. Despite that, her husband had ranted at her for at least ten minutes, unwilling to listen to reason and all because she’d parked the car in the alley. He had the gall to claim she’d asked to be mugged. And then he’d called her stupid.\n Jacqueline was still furious. How dare Reese say such things to her—especially when she’d been doing him a favor! Because of him, her entire day had been ruined. She’d missed her nail appointment entirely, was late for lunch and so rattled she hadn’t found a thing to buy on her shopping spree.\n Other than unavoidable conversation, they hadn’t spoken in five very long days. They wouldn’t be speaking now except for the dinner party, which had been planned weeks earlier. Canceling at the last minute was not an option, so they’d put their argument behind them and assumed their best behavior. Jacqueline was astonished that Tammie Lee had noticed.\n “Did you hear me?” Tammie Lee asked, following Jacqueline into the kitchen with an armload of china.\n Anyone else would have gotten the message and dropped the subject. Not Tammie Lee.\n “You can put those dishes on the counter,” Jacqueline instructed. “Really, there’s no need for you to help. Martha will be here in the morning.” The housekeeper lived in the small guest house in the back. Now that she was older, she rarely had the energy for serving dinner parties. She wanted to retire but Jacqueline relied on her and so Martha stayed on.\n “You don’t want to leave these dishes on the table overnight,” Tammie Lee had insisted and she was right. As soon as everyone had left, Jacqueline would put everything in the dishwasher, a task she preferred to do herself.\n “It was a lovely party,” her daughter-in-law said. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shop-on-blossom-street-blossom-street-1/page-28.html","bookId":1933,"book":{"id":1933,"title":"The Shop on Blossom Street (Blossom Street #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Shop on Blossom Street (Blossom Street #1) \n Bestselling romance author and ardent knitter Debbie Macomber combines both her skills in this novel about a newly opened Seattle yarn shop and the knitting class that brings four women together to make baby blankets.
