That apparently isn’t going to happen, so fine, let’s deal with it and get on with our lives.”\\n\\n “But…”\\n\\n “I don’t want to adopt.”\\n\\n The world all but exploded in pain and disbelief. “You don’t mean that.” Was Doug telling the truth? He couldn’t be. He was emotionally drained. She understood, because she’d hit bottom herself, but she’d recovered and Doug would, too, given time.\\n\\n “I do mean it.”\\n\\n “But…you just told me we could go to the appointment with the agency.” Carol was counting on that.\\n\\n “You go. I don’t want to.”\\n\\n “But…why?”\\n\\n “Because I can already see what it’s doing to you.”\\n\\n She’d never known Doug to be so unreasonable. “What exactly is it doing to me?”\\n\\n “We have to prove to complete strangers that we’re worthy of being parents. I feel like a beggar singing and dancing, cap in hand. All so someone I don’t even know will like me enough to consider me father material.”\\n\\n “You’ll be a wonderful father!”\\n\\n “Would have been,” he muttered.\\n\\n His words scored deep wounds in her heart. Would have been.\\n\\n “I can’t do this anymore, Carol. I’m not the man you think I am. I want out.”\\n\\n “Do you want out of the marriage?” she asked through numb lips, hardly able to say the words.\\n\\n “No. I vowed to love you and I do.”\\n\\n “You make it sound as if this is some promise you made and regret,” she said bitterly. “Would you have married me if you’d known I couldn’t have children?”\\n\\n His hesitation was just long enough to supply the answer.\\n\\n Her pain was so intense that for one unbelievable moment the room went dark and she started to sway.\\n\\n Doug’s arms came around her, and he buried his face in her shoulder. “I was crazy in love with you when we got married and I’m just as crazy in love with you now. I want us to stay married, but I can’t live like this anymore.”\\n\\n “I…I can’t have a baby.”\\n\\n “I know and I accept that.”\\n\\n “No, you don’t.” He might be saying it, but deep down he’d always resent the fact that she couldn’t give him children.\\n\\n “I do,” he said sharply, “but I need you to accept it, too. Let go of this, Carol. Accept the fact that we just weren’t meant to be parents.”\\n\\n “But we could be someday. If we put our name in with the agency, then—”\\n\\n “Then what? Three, four, five years from now—if we’re fortunate—we might be chosen as worthy recipients of an infant? Do you realize I’ll be forty-four in five years’ time? I’d be sixty-two when our child graduated from high school.”\\n\\n Carol hid her face against her husband’s chest. Her emotions reeled with the impact of what he’d said. Doug was right. It was time to surrender this need. She’d never been a quitter, didn’t know how to give up. Everything she’d ever set her mind to, she’d accomplished. Except for this…Her effort to have a child had become the focus of her life; more than that, it had become the purpose of her life. Her clenched-teeth determination was ruining their marriage.\\n\\n Doug released her and walked away. Carol stood frozen and miserable, shaking with a combination of too many emotions, but mostly defeat.\\n\\n The front door opened and she whirled around. “Where are you going?”\\n\\n “Out. I need to think.”\\n\\n “When will you be back?” Her eyes begged him not to leave her, but she refused to ask him to stay.\\n\\n “I…don’t know.”\\n\\n She nodded and turned back, hands to her mouth.\\n\\n “We both need to think this through, Carol.”\\n\\n She nodded silently. The choice was clear. Either she renounced this need or she ruined her marriage and both their lives in the process.\\n\\n It was nightfall before Doug returned. Carol sat in the darkened living room, curled up tight on the sofa with her arms circling her knees.\\n\\n Doug came slowly into the room. “Are you okay?”\\n\\n She wasn’t yet, but in time she’d adjust. “I cancelled the appointment with the adoption agency.”\\n\\n He thrust his hands in his pockets. “You can deal with that?”\\n\\n She nodded. She had to accept that there would be no baby.\\n\\n Doug sat down across from her and leaned forward, bracing his arms against his knees. His shoulders drooped.\\n\\n “Where did you go?” she asked.\\n\\n “A walk.”\\n\\n “For three hours?”\\n\\n He nodded.\\n\\n “Do you want anything to eat?”\\n\\n He shook his head.\\n\\n “I phoned Bon-Macy’s. They’re coming to collect the baby furniture next week.”\\n\\n He stared down at the carpet. “I’m sorry,” he whispered.\\n\\n “I am, too.” Sorrier than he’d ever know.\\n\\n Doug extended his arm to her. “We’ll be all right, just the two of us.”\\n\\n “Yes,” she whispered as her fingers clasped his. It was true. It would be true.\\n\\n It had to be true.\\n\\n CHAPTER 44\\n\\n “Knitting is a haven, a safe place where one can touch history, dance with art and create a peaceful life.”\\n\\n —Nancy Bush, author of Folk Socks\\n\\n LYDIA HOFFMAN\\n\\n A t first I was angry when I didn’t hear from Brad. After all his affirmations about being there for the long haul, he’d walked out on me like every other man in my life, with the exception of my father. A thousand times over, I wished I’d read his letter. Finally I couldn’t stand it any longer—I had to know.\\n\\n I turned to my sister for advice; I’d come to rely on her more and more, especially in emotional matters. So on Monday, I called her.\\n\\n “Where are you?” Margaret demanded immediately after I’d said hello.\\n\\n “At the shop.”\\n\\n “It’s Monday. I thought you took Mondays off.”\\n\\n “I do, but there are always a million things to do here and well, it’s where I’m most comfortable.” I did all my best thinking with walls of yarn around me. I’d always looked upon skeins of yarn as unfulfilled promises—the way some people, writers or artists, look at a blank page. The potential is there, and it’s up to us to make something with that yarn or write something on that page. It’s the sense of possibility I find so exciting.\\n\\n Actually, I gave a lot of thought to that analogy. My relationship with Brad held promise and because of my fears I’d let him go. I didn’t do anything with all those possibilities.\\n\\n “You’re calling about Brad, aren’t you?”\\n\\n Sometimes Margaret seems like a mind-reader. “If you must know…yes. Have you heard from him?”\\n\\n “Me? What makes you think he’d contact me?”\\n\\n “Wishful thinking, I suppose.” Even over the telephone line, I could tell my sister was amused by my question.\\n\\n “Are you going to call him?”\\n\\n The idea had been swirling around inside my head all week. “I might.”\\n\\n “Then why are you calling me?” The gruffness I’d experienced so often with her was back in full force.\\n\\n “I don’t know,” I admitted. “Maybe because I was hoping you’d tell me I was doing the right thing and that I wouldn’t make a complete idiot of myself in the process.”\\n\\n Margaret hesitated for only a moment. “If I were you, I’d go for it.”\\n\\n “You would?” Hope sprang to life.\\n\\n “Call me back once you do, okay?”\\n\\n “Okay.” I had to pause to be sure the warmth in her voice was directed at me. “Margaret.” I swallowed, finding it difficult to continue.\\n\\n “What?”\\n\\n “I wanted to thank you for being so wonderful these last few months.”\\n\\n My gratitude must have taken her aback, because she didn’t say anything for a few seconds. Time seemed to be suspended and then I thought I heard a soft sigh.\\n\\n “It’s very nice to have a sister, you know,” she whispered.\\n\\n I couldn’t have agreed with her more.\\n\\n Once I’d determined that the only thing to do was call Brad, I was on a mission. I’d rehearsed several approaches before I dialed his home number later that evening.\\n\\n His son answered on the second ring. “Hello, Cody,” I said.\\n\\n “Hi.” He sounded unsure as if he didn’t recognize my voice.\\n\\n “I’m Lydia. Remember? We met a little while ago.”\\n\\n “I remember! You’re the lady who owns the yarn store. You said you were going to knit me a cool sweater with a green-and-yellow dinosaur on it.”\\n\\n I smiled to myself. “I’ve already started it.” I’d put the project aside when I went into the hospital, but with concentrated effort, I could have it finished by the end of the week. “Is your dad home?”\\n\\n “Just a minute. I’ll get him for you.”\\n\\n My heart died a hundred deaths in the time it took Brad to pick up the receiver. It must’ve been less than a minute but it seemed closer to an hour before I heard his familiar voice.\\n\\n “Hello.”\\n\\n “Hi.” My mouth was so dry, my tongue refused to cooperate. “It’s Lydia.” His silence was nearly my undoing, but I forged ahead, simultaneously blessing and cursing Margaret for encouraging this.\\n\\n “What can I do for you?” he finally asked.\\n\\n “Could we meet and talk?” I asked.\\n\\n “When?”\\n\\n “Whenever it’s convenient for you.” I wanted to shout the sooner, the better, but it depended on his schedule and not mine.\\n\\n “All right. I’ll let you know when I can arrange it.”\\n\\n I waited for him to say something else and when he didn’t, I had no choice but to end the conversation. “I’ll wait to hear from you, then.”\\n\\n “Goodbye.”\\n\\n “Goodbye.” The line went dead and I was left standing with the receiver in my hand and the dial tone in my ear.\\n\\n This was much worse than I’d imagined. I’d secretly hoped that once Brad heard the sound of my voice, he’d be so pleased that whatever pain I’d caused him would evaporate. How foolish I’d been not to consider his feelings.\\n\\n Over the years Margaret’s complaint about me had been that I was self-absorbed. I know she resented the fact that Mom and Dad focused their attention on helping me through my ordeals. I’d always believed that her accusations were unfair, based on her own jealousies and insecurities, but now I began to see things differently.\\n\\n How cheated she must have felt. Cheated and abandoned. For the first time, I wondered if she could be right about me. I couldn’t have done anything about my cancer, but I could’ve changed my reaction to it. I had the victim mentality down to an art form.\\n\\n I remained standing in my kitchen, toying with the idea of calling Margaret again, when the phone rang, startling me. I grabbed the receiver. “Hello.”\\n\\n “I can meet you in half an hour at The Pour House.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-shop-on-blossom-street-blossom-street-1/page-44.html","bookId":1933,"book":{"id":1933,"title":"The Shop on Blossom Street (Blossom Street #1)","description":"Storyline: The Shop on Blossom Street (Blossom Street #1) \\n Bestselling romance author and ardent knitter Debbie Macomber combines both her skills in this novel about a newly opened Seattle yarn shop and the knitting class that brings four women together to make baby blankets.
