{"id":43767,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI.","content":"THE news of the occupation of Viteau by a band of robbers, occasioned, as well might be supposed, the greatest astonishment at the castle of Barran. At first, every one, from the Lord of the castle to the lowest varlet, was loud in favor of an immediate march upon the scoundrels, with all the force that could be gathered together on the domain. But after Barran had held a consultation with the Countess, Hugo de Lannes, and the very sensible and prudent Bernard, he determined not to be too hasty in this important matter. If the story of the squire who had been sent to Viteau was true,—and there was no reason to doubt it,—it would require every fighting man on the estates of the Count de Barran to make up a force sufficiently strong to compel the cotereaux to leave the chateau; and if this force should not be large enough to completely surround and invest the place, the captain of the robbers might make good his threat of burning the chateau and retreating to the forest, which he could probably reach in safety, if the retreat should be made in the night. \n \n But, even if the Count had been able to raise men enough to make a successful attack upon the cotereaux at Viteau, he did not wish, at this time, to strip his castle of all its defenders. If it should be concluded that the Countess should endeavor to escape to England, a tolerably strong party might be necessary to conduct her to the coast; and if the officers of the Inquisition should appear at his gates, he would like to be there with enough men to compel at least parley and delay. \n \n It would, also, be difficult to hold the chateau, after it should be taken, during this serious quarrel with the cotereaux. If the lady of Viteau had been at home, she might have summoned many of her vassals to her aid, but it was not to be supposed that these people would willingly risk their lives, and expose their families to the vengeance of the robbers, to defend a dwelling which its owner had deserted. \n \n It was, therefore, determined not to attempt, at present, to disturb the cotereaux at Viteau, who, as long as their demand for a ransom for young Louis was not positively denied, would probably refrain from doing any serious injury to the property. When the Countess should be in safety, a force could be raised from some of the estates, and from villages in the surrounding country, to thoroughly defeat the cotereaux and to break up their band. Suitable arrangements then could be made to hold and defend the chateau until the Countess or her heirs should come back to take possession. \n \n What was to be done for the unfortunate mother of Raymond and Louis, now became again the great question. Flight to England, which, though a Catholic country, was not under the power of the Inquisition, as were France and some of the neighboring countries, would have been immediately determined upon, had it not been for the great unwillingness of the Countess to consent to separate herself from her sons. \n \n If she should leave France and take her children with her, her property would probably be taken possession of by the Church or the Crown; whereas, if her sons, under a proper guardian, should remain in France, the estate would be considered to belong to them, for they had done nothing to make them forfeit it; and everything could go on as usual, until the friends of the Countess should have opportunity to represent the matter to some of the high authorities of the Church. Then, if she could be released from the prosecution by the Inquisition, she could return in peace to her home. \n \n On the day after the squire\u0027s return from Viteau, and after it had been decided to leave the cotereaux in possession for the present, Raymond and Louis, with Agnes, were sitting together at a window in one of the great towers of the castle, talking of the proposed journey of the Countess; Louis had been told the reason of her flight from Viteau, and, of course, Agnes knew all about it. \n \n \"If I were the Count de Barran,\" said Louis, very much in earnest, \"I should never make a lady, like our mother, run away to England, nor to any other savage country, to get rid of her enemies. I should fill this castle with soldiers and knights, and I\u0027d defend her against everybody, to the last drop of my blood. Wasn\u0027t Barran the brother-in-arms of our father? And isn\u0027t he bound, by all his vows, to protect our mother, when her husband isn\u0027t here on earth to do it himself?\" \n \n \"You don\u0027t look at things in the right way, Louis,\" said Raymond. \"Of course, the Count would defend our mother against all enemies, for he is a brave and true knight; but we can not say that the priests and officers of the Church are our enemies. Now, if Barran fights the people of the Inquisition, he is fighting the Church, and no Christian knight wants to do that.\" \n \n \"I\u0027d like to know what an enemy is,\" said Louis, \"If he isn\u0027t a person who wants to do you an injury; and that, it seems to me, is exactly what these Inquisition people are trying to do to our mother. I shouldn\u0027t care whether they belonged to the Church or not.\" \n \n \"Oh, yes, you would,\" said Raymond, \"if you had taken the vows of a Christian knight. The Count will do everything he can to save our mother from these people, but he will not want to fight and slay Church officers, and his men-at-arms would not help him,—I heard Count de Lannes say that,—for whoever should do such a thing would be excommunicated by the Pope of Rome, and would be cast out from all Christian fellowship and all hope of salvation. Our mother would not let any one fight for her, when she should know that such things would happen to him.\" \n \n \"Bernard would fight for her,\" said Louis; \"and so would I.\" \n \n \"And so would I, as well you know,\" said his brother, \"and so would the Count and many another knight, if things came to the worst. They would not stop to think what would happen afterward. But it would be a sad thing to do. It would be much better for our mother to go away, than to put her friends in such jeopardy of their souls. I have heard all this talked about, and I know how hard a thing it is for the Count to send our mother away. But one thing is certain: when she goes, I go with her. I care not for the domain.\" \n \n \"And I go too!\" cried Louis. \"Let the robbers and the priests divide Viteau between them. I will not let my mother go among the barbarians without me.\" \n \n \"The English are not barbarians,\" said Raymond. \"There are plenty of good knights and noble ladies at the court of King Henry, and all over the land, too, as I have read.\" \n \n \"I thought they must be savages,\" said Louis, \"because they have no Inquisition. Surely, if England were a Christian land like France, there would be an Inquisition there.\" \n \n Up to this time Agnes had been silent, eagerly listening to the conversation of the boys. But now she spoke: \n \n \"Louis and Raymond!\" she cried, \"I think it will be an awful, dreadful thing for your poor mother to go to England; I don\u0027t care what sort of a country it is, or who goes with her. Isn\u0027t there somebody who can make these people stop their wicked doings without fighting them? Can\u0027t the King do it?\" \n \n \"Of course he can,\" cried Louis. \"The King can do anything.\" \n \n AGNES TELLS RAYMOND AND LOUIS OF HER PLAN. \n \n \"Perhaps he can,\" said Raymond. \"I spoke to my mother about that this morning, and asked her why Count de Barran did not go to the King and beseech him to inquire into this matter, and to see why one of his subjects—as good a Christian as any in the land—should be so persecuted. She said I spoke too highly of her——\" \n \n \"Which you did not,\" cried Louis. \n \n \"Indeed, I did not,\" continued Raymond. \"And then she told me that the mother of our King, Queen Blanche, who has more to do with the affairs of France than her son himself, does not like Barran, who, with our father, opposed her long with voice and sword, in the disputes between Burgundy and the Crown. So it is that he could not go to ask a favor of her son, for fear that it would do us more harm than good.\" \n \n \"But is he the only person in the world?\" cried Agnes. \"Why can\u0027t somebody else go? Why don\u0027t you go, Raymond, with Louis—and with me? Let us all three go! We can tell the King what has happened, as well as any one, and the Queen-Mother can not bear a grudge against any of us. Let us go! My father will not say me nay.\" \n \n Louis agreed instantly to this glorious plan, and Raymond, after a moment\u0027s thought, gave it a hearty assent. \n \n \"We\u0027ll start by the dawn of day to-morrow,\" cried Agnes; and away she ran to ask her father if she might mount a horse, and go with Louis and Raymond to Paris, to see the King. \n \n Strange as it may seem, this wild plan of the children was received with favor by their elders. Something must be done immediately, and the Countess must either leave France, or some powerful aid must be asked for. Measures had been taken to put the matter before some of the high officials of the Church, but it was believed that they would first send for Brother Anselmo and the priests, and would hear their story, before interfering for the Countess; and, therefore, whatever help might be expected in this direction, would probably be much delayed and come too late. \n \n But if the King should desire it, the matter would be instantly investigated, and that was all that the Countess and her friends intended to ask. They felt sure that if some one, more competent and less prejudiced than the two or three monks who had been incensed by their failure to answer her arguments, should examine the charges against her, it would be found that she believed nothing but what was taught by the fathers of the Church, and believed in by all good people who had read what the authors had written. \n \n And who could go with better grace to ask the help of the King—himself young—than these three young people: two boys who would speak in behalf of their mother, and the young girl, their friend, who might be able to talk with the Queen-Mother, if there should be need of it? \n \n Count Hugo de Lannes readily agreed to take charge of the young embassadors, if his daughter should be one of them. He was well known in Paris, and could give them proper introduction and guarantee their statements. Thus his assistance would be very great. \n \n It was agreed that by dawn the next morning, just as Agnes had said, the party should start for Paris, and that, until its return, the Countess should postpone her flight from France. \n \n And many earnest prayers were said that night, that nothing evil might happen to the Countess while her two boys should be absent from her. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1877/54292.html","bookId":803,"book":{"id":803,"title":"The Story of Viteau","description":"简介： BY the side of a small stream, which ran through one of the most picturesque portions of the province of Burgundy, in France, there sat, on a beautiful day in early summer, two boys, who were brothers....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1877","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM"}}
