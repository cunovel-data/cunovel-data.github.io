{"id":43766,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X.","content":"A FEW days after the arrival of Louis and Jasto at the castle of Barran, the Countess found it necessary to send to Viteau for some clothing and other things which were needed by herself and her ladies, for they had brought very little with them in their hasty flight from the chateau. A trusty squire—not Bernard, for he would not leave his mistress for so long a time as a day and night—was sent, with a small, but well-armed body of men, to convey to the castle the property desired by the Countess, and to give some orders to the seneschal in charge. When the party reached the chateau, early in the evening, the squire was greatly surprised to find that he could not enter. The gates were all closed and barred securely, and no answer came to his calls and shouts to the inmates. A SMALL WINDOW WAS OPENED. At length, a small window in the principal gate was opened, and a man\u0027s head, wearing a helmet with the visor down, appeared in the square aperture. \"Which of the varlets that we left here are you?\" cried the angry squire. \"And what are you doing with the armor of the Countess on your rascally head? Did you not know me when I called to you, and when are you going to open this gate for us?\" \"I am not any man\u0027s varlet,\" said the person in the helmet, \"and you did not leave me here. I wear this helmet because I thought that some of your impatient men might thrust at me with a spear, or shoot an arrow at me when I should show my head. I did not know you when you called, for I never heard your voice before, and I am not going to open the gate for you at all.\" The squire sat upon his horse, utterly astounded at this speech, while his men gathered around him, wondering what strange thing they next would hear. \"Who, then, are you?\" cried the squire, when he had found his voice, \"and what are you doing here?\" \"I have no objection,\" said the other, \"to make the acquaintance of any man who wants to know me, and to tell him what I do, if it be, in any way, his business. I am Michol, the captain of the good and true band of cotereaux who for some time past have lived in this forest, near by; and what I am doing here is this: I am dwelling in this goodly chateau, in peace and comfort, with my men.\" The squire turned and looked at his followers. \"What think you,\" he said, \"does all this mean? Is this a man gone crazed?\" \"Not so,\" said the man with the helmet; \"not so, my good fellow. I may have done crazy deeds in by-gone days, but this is the most sane thing I ever did in all my life. If you should care to hear the whole story, straight and true,—and I should like much to tell it to you, that you may take it to your mistress,—come closer and listen.\" The squire, anxious enough to hear, rode close to the gate; the men crowded near him, and Michol, for it was really the captain of the cotereaux, told his story. \"I am going to make this tale a short one,\" he said, \"so that you can remember it, and tell it clearly, all of you. When the boy, son of the Countess of Viteau, was stolen from us——\" \"Stolen!\" ejaculated the squire. \"Yes,\" said the other, \"that is the word. We captured the youngster fairly on the road, and held him for fitting and suitable ransom; and before we had opportunity to acquaint his friends with his whereabouts, and with the sum demanded for him, he was basely stolen by a traitor of our company, and carried away from us, thus cheating us of what was our fair and just reward.\" \"Reward!\" exclaimed the squire. \"Reward for what?\" \"For treating him well and not killing him,\" said Michol, coolly. \"When I found out the base deed that had been done to us,\" he continued, \"I gathered all my men, together with another band of brave fellows, who gladly joined us, and I came boldly here to demand the ransom for the boy, and the body of the wretched villain who stole him away. And when I found no boy, and no traitor, and no Countess, and no one in the whole chateau but an old man and some stupid varlets, I blessed my happy stars, and took possession of the whole domain. And this I shall hold, occupy, and defend, until the Countess, its former mistress, shall send to me one hundred silver marks, together with the person of the traitor Jasto. When these shall have been fairly delivered to me, I shall surrender the chateau, and honorably depart, with all my men.\" \"You need expect nothing of that kind,\" cried the squire. \"Count de Barran and the good knights with him, when they hear this story, will come down upon you and drive you out with all your men; and never a piece of money, gold or silver, will you gain by this deed—unless, indeed, it shall be such as you shall find here.\" \"I shall have my money,\" replied Michol; \"but until I hear that my just demands are denied, I shall break no bars or locks to look for it. My men and I will live merrily on the good stores of the Countess; but while we hold this place as warranty for her son\u0027s ransom, we shall not sack or pillage. But if your lord and his knights should come to drive me out, they would find more good soldiers here than they can bring, for in times of peace we are strong, and the lords of the land are weak, unless, indeed, they keep retainers and men-at-arms for mere show and ostentation. My men are well armed, too, for the Count of Viteau kept his armory well furnished, as became a valiant knight and a leader of fighting men. So, therefore, if Barran shall come to give us foul blows, instead of fair words and just deeds, he will get blow for blow, and harder blows, methinks, than he can strike; and if it should be, by strange fortune, that he drive us out, he would drive us only from the blazing ruins of this chateau.[A] All this I tell you, my good squire, that you may tell it to Barran and the Countess. Think you you will remember it?\" A. Such was the lawlessness of the times, when people had to rely on themselves for protection and defense, that a deed like the taking of this chateau would probably meet with no immediate punishment, unless it were inflicted by the injured owner or his friends. \"Indeed will I,\" said the squire. \"Such words can not easily be forgotten. But then I truly think——\" \"No more of that!\" interrupted Michol. \"I do not care what you think. Hear, remember, and tell. That is enough for you in this matter. And, now, what brought you here? You did not come to bring word, good or bad, to me?\" \"Indeed I did not,\" said the other, \"for I knew not you were here. I came, at the command of the Countess of Viteau, to get for her certain garments and needful goods belonging to herself and ladies, which she could not, with convenience, take with her to the castle, but which, I suppose, if your tale be true, I shall go back without.\" \"Not so,\" said Michol. \"I war not on fair ladies, until they themselves declare the war. You shall come in, and take away what your lady needs. That is, if you fear not to enter alone.\" These words made the squire turn pale. He was afraid to trust himself, alone, inside the walls of the chateau court-yard, but he was ashamed to own it—ashamed that his own men should see his fear, or that Michol should see it. And so, out of very cowardice and fear of mockery, he did a thing which was exceedingly brave, and entered by the wicket in the gate, which Michol opened for him. Inside the court and in the chateau, the squire saw, as Michol was very glad to have him see, hundreds of cotereaux, well armed, and in a good state of discipline, and he felt sure, at last, that the tale he had been told was true. The articles he had been sent for were all delivered to him, and properly packed by Michol\u0027s men for conveyance on the baggage-horses that had been brought for the purpose. Then the goods were carried out, and the squire was allowed to depart, without hurt or hindrance. Provisions were sent outside the gates for the squire and his men and horses, and that night they bivouacked by the roadside. The next morning they rode back to Barran\u0027s castle, and the squire delivered to the Countess the property he had been sent for, and told the wonderful tale that the captain of the cotereaux had instructed him to tell.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1877/54291.html","bookId":803,"book":{"id":803,"title":"The Story of Viteau","description":"简介： BY the side of a small stream, which ran through one of the most picturesque portions of the province of Burgundy, in France, there sat, on a beautiful day in early summer, two boys, who were brothers....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1877","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM"}}
