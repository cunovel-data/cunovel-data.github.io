{"id":43759,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III.","content":"WHEN the first pain caused by the separation from his dear mother and brother began to subside in Louis\u0027 heart,—and it must be admitted that it began to subside pretty soon, the day being so bright and everybody in such good spirits,—he felt quite proud to see himself at the head of such a goodly company, and greatly wished that they would fall in with some enemy, so that he might have a little conquering to tell about when he should reach his future home. But no enemy was met, and, if a fight had taken place, it is not likely that the boy would have been able to boast of his part in it, for Bernard was very careful of his young charge, and as soon as they had left the neighborhood of the Chateau de Viteau, and had entered the forest through which ran their road for the greater part of the journey, he made Louis ride about the middle of the little procession, while he himself went a short distance in advance, looking carefully about him for the first signs of robbers, or any one else who might be likely to dispute their passage. \n \n LOUIS AND BERNARD ON THEIR WAY TO DE BARRAN\u0027S CASTLE. \n \n But no such persons were met, and towards the end of the afternoon Louis and his train rode into the court-yard of the castle. \n \n The moment that he entered the great gates, the quick eye of the boy perceived that he had come to a place very different from his mother\u0027s chateau. He had supposed there would be a difference, but had never imagined it would be so great. There were a good many serving-people, of various ranks and orders, at Viteau. There were ladies in attendance on his mother; and sometimes there were knights and other visitors, whose diversions had made what Raymond and Louis had considered a very gay time; but there never had been anything like the lively scenes which met the eye of our young friend, both in the court-yard and in the halls of the castle itself. Outside there were boy-pages running on various errands, or standing about, watching other people and neglecting their own business; and there were squires, men-at-arms, and archers who were lounging in the shade, or busily at work rubbing up a piece of armor, or putting a point on an arrow-head or on a blunted lance. Here and there was a knight not clad in armor, but in fine silk and embroidered cloth, looking at horses which were being led about the inclosure by varlets or inferior serving-men, who generally were dressed in clothes of dirty leather. Two barefooted monks, one of them holding the bridle of a donkey, with a bag thrown across his back, were talking together near the gate. Some people were laughing, some were talking, some were calling to others at a distance, and some were hammering; the horses were making a good deal of noise with their feet; a man was blowing a horn, which he had begun to blow as soon as Louis entered the gates, and which was intended, it appeared, as a general announcement that somebody had arrived who was a friend, and had been admitted freely. All together, there was more noise, and moving about, and standing still, and lying down, than Louis had ever seen, at one time, before. \n \n Inside the castle there was not so much bustle; but knights and ladies, the first generally dressed much more finely, and with more show of color and ornament than their female companions, were to be seen here and there. The pages who were not running about or standing still outside, seemed to be doing the same inside; there was a clatter of metal and wooden dishes in the dining-hall, where the servants were preparing supper; and, in a room opening into the great hall, a tall knight sat upon a stool, with a little harp on his knee, singing one of the romantic songs which were so much liked in those days, and accompanying his voice with a steady \"tum-tum\" on the harp-strings. Around him were several knights and ladies, some sitting and some standing, and all listening, with much satisfaction, to his song. \n \n The Count de Barran, a tall, spare man, with an ugly but good-humored face, gave Louis a kindly welcome. \n \n \"He is the son of Raymond de Viteau, my old brother-at-arms,\" he said to a knight with a great brown beard, who stood beside him, \"and I shall try to make of him as good a knight as his—as I can.\" \n \n \"You were going to say \u0027as good a knight as his father,\u0027 good sir,\" said Louis quickly, looking up into Barran\u0027s face. \"Do you think I cannot be that?\" \n \n \"That will depend upon yourself,\" said the master of the castle. \"Your father was brave and noble above his fellow-knights. If you become his equal, my little fellow, I shall be very proud. And now I shall send you to my sister, the Lady Clemence, who will see that you are taken care of.\" \n \n \"The boy\u0027s quickness of wit comes out well, even now,\" said the brown-bearded knight; \"but you may have to wait for the bravery and the honor to show themselves.\" \n \n \"Not long, I hope,\" replied Barran. \"Good blood must soon make some sign, if he has it in him.\" \n \n The next day Bernard and his train returned to Viteau, with many messages from Louis, and the life of the boy, as the youngest page in the castle, fairly commenced. In a few days he began to understand his duties, and to make friends among the other pages, all of whom were sons of well-born people. These boys had come to the castle to receive the only education they would ever have. Louis did not at first very much like to wait upon the knights and ladies at table, and to find himself expected to serve so many people in so many ways; but he soon became used to these things, especially when he saw other boys, whom he knew to be just as good as he was, doing what he was expected to do. \n \n He had a bright, interesting face, and he soon became a favorite, especially among the ladies, for they liked to be waited upon by a page who was so good-humored and quick. The Count de Barran was not married, and his sister, the Lady Clemence, was at the head of domestic affairs in his castle. \n \n The only very young person among the visitors at the castle was a little girl named Agnes, the motherless daughter of Count Hugo de Lanne, the brown-bearded man who had talked with De Barran about his new page. Between this girl and Louis a friendship soon sprang up. Agnes was a year older than he, and she knew so much of castle-life, and of the duties of a page, that she became one of his best instructors. She was a lively, impulsive girl; and this was the reason, no doubt, why she and Louis got on so well together. \n \n One morning, as Agnes was passing through an upper hall, she saw, standing at a window which overlooked the court-yard, our young friend Louis, with an enormous battle-ax over his shoulder. As she approached, he turned from the window, out of which he had been looking. \n \n \"What in the world,\" she cried, \"are you doing with that great ax, and what makes you look so doleful?\" \n \n \"I am taking the ax down to the armorer\u0027s shop, to be sharpened and polished,\" he said. \n \n \"It is too big a thing for you to be carrying about,\" said Agnes, \"and it seems sharp enough now. And as to you, you look as if you were going somewhere to cut your head off with it. What is the matter with you?\" \n \n \"That is the matter,\" said Louis, turning again to the window, and pointing to a body of horsemen who were just riding out of the gate. They had dogs with them, and several of them carried each a hooded falcon perched upon his wrist. \n \n \"Did you want to go hunting herons? Is that what troubles you?\" asked Agnes. \n \n \"No, indeed; I don\u0027t want to go,\" said Louis. \"I hate to see falcons.\" \n \n \"What did you look at them for, then?\" asked Agnes. \"But I don\u0027t see how you can hate them. I love to see them swooping about, so lordly, in the air. Why do not you like them as well as I do?\" \n \n Moved by a strong desire to share his secret with some one, Louis, after a little hesitation, finally put the battle-ax on the floor, and told Agnes the whole story of the loss of his brother\u0027s falcon, first making her promise that she would never repeat it to any one. He told it all in a straightforward way, and finished by explaining how the sight of the hunters made him think of his poor brother, who could not go hawking for ever so long. Indeed, he did not know that Bernard would be willing to get another hawk and take all the trouble of training it. He might be very angry. \n \n \"I think it\u0027s easy enough to make that right,\" said Agnes. \"You ought to give your brother another hawk, already trained.\" \n \n \"I would like much to know where I am to get it,\" said Louis. \n \n Agnes thought for a moment. \n \n \"My father will give you one,\" she said, \"if I ask him. If he questions me as to what you want with it, I can tell him, with truth, that you want to give it to your brother, who has no falcon, and who needs one very much.\" \n \n \"Do you really think he would give me one?\" asked Louis, with brightening face. \n \n \"I am sure of it,\" said Agnes. \"He has plenty of trained falcons, and he could spare one easily enough. I will ask him, as soon as he comes back to-day.\" \n \n Accordingly, when Count Hugo returned from his hawking expedition that afternoon, he was met by his little daughter, who asked him for a falcon, a well-trained and good one, which could hunt hares as well as birds, and which would be sure to come back to its master whenever it was called. \n \n Of course such a request as this excited some surprise, and required a good deal of explanation. But when Count Hugo, who was a very indulgent father, and who had also quite a liking for Louis, heard what was to be done with the bird, he consented to give it. \n \n \"If he wanted it for himself,\" he said, \"I should not let him have it, for a page has no need of falcons, and a boy of the right spirit ought not to desire gifts; but, as he wants it for his brother, who is in a station to use it, it shows a generous disposition, and he shall have it.\" And calling to one of his falconers to bring him a hawk, he handed it to Agnes, and told her that she should herself give it to her young friend. \n \n \"He and you can look at it for a quarter of an hour,\" said the Count, \"and then he must bring it back to Orion, here, who will feed and take care of it until the boy has an opportunity of sending it to his brother. Don\u0027t take its hood off, and keep your fingers well clear of its beak.\" \n \n When Agnes appeared with the falcon unsteadily perched on her two small fists, which she had covered with a scarf, to keep its talons from hurting her, Louis was overwhelmed with delight. He was sure that this was a much finer bird than the one he had lost. \n \n When the falcon had been sufficiently admired, and had been returned to its keeper, and when Louis had run to find Count Hugo, and had thanked him for his kindness, the question arose between the two young friends: How was he to be carried to Raymond? \n \n LOUIS, AGNES, AND THE FALCON. \n \n \"If I had any way of riding there, I\u0027d take it to him myself. I want him to have it just as soon as he can get it,\" said Louis. \n \n \"I can lend you my jennet,\" said Agnes. \"He is small, but can travel far.\" \n \n \"You will lend him!\" cried Louis. \"And are you not going to use him for two days? It will take at the very least two days to go to Viteau and come back.\" \n \n \"I may not ride him for a week,\" said Agnes. \"But you must not travel to your mother\u0027s house alone. You must wait until some company is going that way.\" \n \n Louis would have been willing to start off by himself, but he knew he would not be allowed to do so; and he had to curb his impatience for three whole days before an opportunity of making his journey offered itself. Then a knight from the south was leaving the castle, with a small train, and as they would pass near Viteau, Louis was allowed to accompany them. \n \n The Count de Barran was not pleased that his new page should ask for leave of absence so soon; but, as it was represented that there was good reason for the journey, and as the Lady Clemence urged the boy\u0027s request, he was allowed to go. \n \n So, early one morning Louis started away, the gayest of his company, his little Spanish steed were evidently the present dwelling-places of these robbers, or cotereaux, as they were called. There were several classes of highwaymen, or brigands, in France at this time, and of these the cotereaux were, probably, the most numerous. \n \n There were fires built in various places about the open space in which the huts had been erected, and there were a good many men around the fires. A smell of cooking meat made Louis feel sure that supper would soon be ready, and this was a comforting thing to him, for he was very hungry. The supper which was served to him was of plain food, but he had enough, and the bed he slept on, at the back part of the Captain\u0027s hut, was nothing but a lot of dry leaves and twigs, with a coarse cloth thrown over it; but Louis was very tired, and it was not long before he was sound asleep. \n \n He was much troubled, of course, at the thought of going to bed in this way, in the midst of a band of robbers, but he was not afraid that they would do him any injury, for he had heard enough about these cotereaux to know that they took prisoners almost always for the purpose of making money out of them, and not to do them useless harm. If he had been an older and a deeper thinker, he would, probably, have thought of the harm which might be done to him in case no money could be made by overtaken. He expected to be pursued, for he knew the knight and his men would not allow him to go off by himself if it could be prevented. \n \n So he galloped on, his falcon tightly grasping the saddle-bow, and he himself turning around every few minutes, to see if he were followed. But he saw no horsemen riding after him. The knight\u0027s men had straggled a good deal after they had turned into the new road, and Louis was not missed for an hour or two. Then, when his absence was discovered, the knight sent three men after him, with instructions to bring him back, or to escort him to Viteau, in case they found him near that place. It was supposed, of course, that he had slipped away, so as to get home as soon as possible. \n \n The men did not like the job at all, for they feared they would not be able to return until after dark to the chateau where their party was to spend the night, and they did not fancy traveling at night for the sake of a boy they knew very slightly, and cared very little about. So, after riding five or six miles, they agreed to halt until nearly night, and ride back to their party at the top of their speed, and report that they had overtaken Louis, and had accompanied him to a spot within sight of his mother\u0027s chateau. This story was believed by the knight from the south, who had no very clear idea as to the distance of Viteau from the forks of the road; and no further thought was given to the young page. \n \n As for Louis, he kept madly on his way. His horse was strong and fleet, but it was beginning to flag a little in its pace, when, suddenly, it stopped short. A tall man stood in front of it, and in a moment had seized the panting animal by the bridle. Another man, with a pike in his hand, appeared on the right, while several others came out from behind some bushes on the left. The tall man wore a cuirass, or body-armor, of steel rings linked closely together, which had probably once been bright and shining, but which was now very rusty and old. He wore no other armor, and his clothes seemed torn and soiled. The whole party, indeed, as Louis, with open mouth and eyes, glanced quickly around him,—too much startled to speak,—seemed to be a very rusty set of fellows. \n \n Louis did not long remain silent. Indeed, he was the first one to speak. He had often seen such persons as these among the serfs and varlets at the castle, and he had been accustomed to respect from them. \n \n \"Ho there!\" he cried, \"move out of my way. Step from the road, do you hear? I am going home to my mother\u0027s chateau, and I am in a hurry.\" \n \n \"Your mother can wait,\" said the tall man. \"We should be pleased to have your company ourselves to-night. So do not be angry. You can not go on.\" \n \n \"I believe,\" cried Louis, his eyes flashing, although they were full of tears, \"that you are a set of robbers.\" \n \n \"That is true,\" said the other, \"and this little man, and this little horse, and this very fine falcon, are our booty.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1877/54284.html","bookId":803,"book":{"id":803,"title":"The Story of Viteau","description":"简介： BY the side of a small stream, which ran through one of the most picturesque portions of the province of Burgundy, in France, there sat, on a beautiful day in early summer, two boys, who were brothers....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1877","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM"}}
