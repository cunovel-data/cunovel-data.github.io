{"id":43771,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XV.","content":"THE leader of the officers of the Inquisition was not long in discovering the retreat of the Countess. He was greatly assisted by the monks of the monastery near Viteau, who suspected, from what had been said by some of the cotereaux who occasionally found it necessary to go outside of the chateau court-yard, that something of importance had occurred at Viteau. By careful inquiries they soon found out that the Countess was there, and reported the fact to the chief officer at his headquarters at Barran\u0027s castle. \n \n The Count, on the contrary, did not know where the Countess of Viteau had gone. She and Bernard had thought it best not to inform him of her place of refuge, and Barran had not endeavored to discover this place, deeming it unsafe for any one in the castle to know where she was, so long as her pursuers were with him. He knew by the actions of his unwelcome visitors that she had not been captured, but he never imagined that she was in her own chateau of Viteau. \n \n Early on the morning of the second day after that on which Count Hugo and his party started on their return from Paris, bearing the happy news that the King had consented to interfere in behalf of the Countess, and that one or two well-qualified persons were, as soon as possible, to visit her at the castle of Barran to give her an opportunity of properly representing her case, the Inquisitors appeared at Viteau. \n \n Viteau, although not exactly a castle, was, like all the residences of the upper classes in those days, a strongly defended place. It had a wall around the court-yard, and its numerous towers and turrets and little balconies were constructed to accommodate and protect a large number of archers and cross-bow men. \n \n Therefore it was that Robert de Comines, the leader of the Inquisitorial party, thought it well to have a strong body of men with him in case it became necessary to force his way into the chateau. \n \n First posting soldiers at every entrance to the grounds, Comines marched to the great gate and demanded admittance. Michol, who had received notice that a large body of men was approaching, and who felt quite sure that he knew who they were, gave some orders to his under-officers and hastened to the gate. \n \n \"Who may you be?\" said Michol from the window in the gate, \"and why come you here? These gates open, now, to no visitors, friends or foes.\" \n \n Comines did not see fit to state the object of his visit, nor to exhibit his authority, and without answering Michol\u0027s questions, he asked another. \n \n \"Are you the captain of the robbers who have seized upon this chateau?\" he said. \n \n \"I am the captain of the good and valiant cotereaux, who hold this chateau and its belongings as a warranty for a just and righteous debt,\" answered Michol. \"Have you aught to say to me concerning the matter?\" \n \n \"I have something to say to you,\" replied Comines, \"which you will do well to hear, and that speedily. Open the gate and let me enter.\" \n \n \"If you wish to speak with me,\" answered Michol, \"I am ready to hear what you have to say. But you need not enter, fair sir. I will come out to you.\" \n \n \"No, no!\" cried the other. \"I must go in. Open the gate!\" \n \n \"That will I, gladly,\" said Michol, \"but it must be for me to go out and not for you to come in. This is not my dwelling, nor are these my lands. I meet my friends and foes in the forest and on the road.\" \n \n At these words the gates were thrown open, and Michol rushed out, followed by nearly all his men, who had been closely massed behind him while he spoke. The cotereaux were in such a large and solid body that they completely filled the gateway and forced back Comines and his men, who vainly endeavored to maintain their ground before the gate. \n \n Comines shouted and threatened, and his followers manfully struggled with the robbers, who surged like a great wave from the gate; but it was of no use. Out came the cotereaux, and backward were forced Comines\u0027s men, until all the robbers, excepting those who were left to guard the other gates, and some archers who were posted on certain of the towers, had rushed into the road, and the gates had been locked behind them. \n \n The sudden confusion had been so great that, at first, the two leaders could not find each other. At length they met in the middle of the road, and the men of each party disengaged themselves from one another as rapidly as possible, and gathered in two confronting bodies, each behind its leader. \n \n \"Here am I. What would you have?\" said Michol. \n \n \"Thief and leader of thieves!\" cried the enraged Comines. \"Do you suppose that I want you! You shall feel the power of the Church in your own person for this violence. Know that I am an officer of the Holy Inquisition, with all due authority and warrant to carry out my purpose, and that I come to apprehend and take before our high tribunal the person of the Countess of Viteau, who is behind those walls. Now that you know my errand, stand back and let me enter.\" \n \n \"That will I not,\" said Michol, firmly. \"Whatever your errand and your authority, you come too late. The Countess of Viteau is now my prisoner. I hold her and this chateau as security for the payment of ransom-money justly due me; and I will give her up to no man until that ransom shall be paid. Whatever warrant you may have, I know well that you have none to take from me my prisoner.\" \n \n \"Rascal!\" cried Comines, \"who would show a warrant to a thief? Will you open that gate to me?\" \n \n \"No,\" said Michol, \"I will not.\" \n \n \"Then take that for my authority!\" said Comines, drawing his sword as he spoke, and making a sudden thrust at the robber leader. \n \n Michol had no sword, but in his right hand he bore a mace or club with a heavy steel or iron head. This was a weapon generally used by knights on horseback, but Michol was a tall, strong fellow, and he carried it with ease. Stepping quickly aside as Comines thrust at him, he swung his mace in the air, and brought it down upon his adversary\u0027s head with such rapidity and force that it knocked him senseless to the ground. \n \n This blow was followed, almost instantly, by a general conflict. As none of Comines\u0027s men were mounted, their horses having been left at the monastery, and as they did not number half as many as the cotereaux,—who were, indeed, in much stronger force than Comines and the monks had imagined,—the fight was not a long one. The robbers soon overpowered their opponents, killing some, causing others to make a disorderly flight, and taking a number of prisoners. \n \n The latter were carefully robbed,—not an article of value, not a weapon, nor piece of armor being left on their persons,—and then they were set free to carry away their wounded and dead comrades. \n \n Michol sent a detachment of his men to attack the soldiers who had been placed outside of the other entrances to the chateau; and when these had been routed and the battle-field in front of the great gate had been cleared of enemies, dead and alive, the robber captain entered the court-yard with his men, and the gates were locked and barred behind him. \n \n Bernard, the squire, had been watching the combat from a high tower. \n \n \"I knew,\" he said to himself, when it was over, \"that this was the only place in France where the Countess would be safe. For none but a pack of thieves would have dared to fight those who came to capture her.\" \n \n The Countess was greatly agitated when she heard of the affair, for she knew nothing of it until it was over. She was glad and thankful that her pursuers had been defeated in their object, but she thought it was a terrible thing to have had an actual conflict with them. \n \n Her good squire did his best to make matters look as well as possible. \n \n \"You must remember, my lady,\" said he, \"that the fight was not within our walls, and that none of us took part in it. And, I trow, we shall not soon see again those men from Toulouse; for the leader of them has been grievously disabled, and it will be many a day before he will again desire to carry off anybody.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1877/54296.html","bookId":803,"book":{"id":803,"title":"The Story of Viteau","description":"简介： BY the side of a small stream, which ran through one of the most picturesque portions of the province of Burgundy, in France, there sat, on a beautiful day in early summer, two boys, who were brothers....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1877","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:33 AM"}}
