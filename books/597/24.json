{"id":17960,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"It was shortly after he had said a last good-bye to Lettice Nevern that Caragh\u0027s troubles began afresh. He had the best intention to acquire the married habit, or a habit, at any rate, that should differ widely from the one he had. With that object he secluded himself for a fortnight from the life to which he was accustomed, and denied his company, for reasons which they vigorously disbelieved, to his friends. He could allow himself the theatre, having never cherished lime-lit illusions, nor hovered to dispel them about the stage door. He had always what he was pleased to call a frugal taste in beauty, and had never made a bid for any that was \u0027priced\u0027! But the theatres only served him for a week, and even so with some exaggeration of what he wished to see. At the end of a second, he decided that a wife was as essential as repentance to a change of life, and dropped back into his old ways. And the devil, who, perhaps as a reprisal for the deficiencies of his own abode, takes a pleasure in knocking the bottom out of every sort of domicile, at once put his foot through the flooring of Maurice Caragh\u0027s reform. At least he met Laura Marton at the dinner which closed his fortnight\u0027s sojourn in the wilderness. He was suffering from those two weeks of his own society, but, probably, even without that preparation, he would have capitulated to her charm. To speak of him, so consecutively, in the hands of three women gives too crowded an impression of his susceptiveness. No trait was, in fact, further from his character. Three years were passed since he met Ethel Vernon, and he had not harboured in all of them so much as a vexed thought about a woman\u0027s face. He was pleased so far from easily, that he might very readily have failed throughout his life to have been pleased at all. But when pleased, it was on the instant and absorbingly. Ten seconds he had suggested as an average requirement for falling in love, but it is questionable if any of his own declensions had taken half that time. Nor was proximity at all essential. He could not recall, he admitted modestly, having discovered that a woman was adorable at more than a hundred yards. But he had no wish to exalt his own experience into a standard: he could believe in anything up to half a mile. In that, such was the delicacy of his distinctions, he was perfectly sincere; but it was that delicacy which made them so prohibitive to adorations even at half a mile. Laura Marton might, perhaps, have tested such a distance successfully, she was so perfectly his conception of a type. He conceived a good deal in types, and preferred the typical even to the length of its deficiencies. Deficiency did indeed play a part in Laura Marten\u0027s attractions, since the broad mouth, the long eyes, and the drowsy luxuriance of her figure were without everything that could make them harmless. She came under the superbs in Caragh\u0027s catalogue, and to the superb he was almost a stranger. That, perhaps, speeded his intimacy. \"You can take it for granted that I think you magnificent,\" he said at their first meeting. This was their last. It epitomized sufficiently what had happened in the interval. Some of it might be accounted for by his having told her that the next interval was for ever. The occasion was a dance at a big house in Grosvenor Square. It was Caragh\u0027s last appearance as a bachelor in town, since he started on the morrow for a trip which the owners of a new Atlantic liner were taking in her round the Isles. He was to be dropped at Ballindra, where his marriage, for recent family reasons, was after all to take place. He was seated on a lounge in a blind passage near the top of the house, and, though still early in the evening, he had been sitting there for some time. He knew the house more intimately than most of those who were seeking for such seats, and this one was left to him and his partner entirely undisturbed. The music floated up the stairs with varying distinctness, as the dancers choked the entrances to the great gallery below. He was leaning back, with his arms half folded and a hand upon his mouth, looking straight before him. Laura Marton, sitting sideways with one white arm along the top of the lounge and the sweep of her amber-coloured skirts against his feet, bent forward insistently towards him; a braid of gold across her splendid shoulders, and a band of turquoise in her brown hair. The long soft fawn gloves were crumpled in her lap, and her left arm, which hung straight and bare beside her, tapped a turquoise fan against her ankle as she waited for his reply. \"I know,\" he sighed. \"You don\u0027t and you can\u0027t see it: what\u0027s the use of my saying it again? You\u0027re sure no woman would care for what I\u0027m giving her, if she only knew. I daresay; but, you see, she\u0027s not going to know. She\u0027s going to luxuriate in an apparent adoration. That\u0027s easier than to be happy with one that\u0027s inapparent, however actual. And it\u0027s a lot likelier that the make-believe will last; because—well, because there\u0027s nothing in it not to.\" He smiled whimsically at his own English, but the girl\u0027s face darkened with a frown. \"It makes no difference how you put it,\" she exclaimed hotly; \"the thing\u0027s detestable! You\u0027ll only look at it from your point of view; and because it\u0027s costing you so much, you think it must be worth all that to the girl. But it\u0027s not! You\u0027re getting her life, and everything that\u0027s in her and of her, and you\u0027re getting it for a lie! You think it\u0027s a fine lie, I know, the sort of lie that life is all along. You\u0027ve told me that! Oh, yes, you have; or something like it. But what are you that you should handle a woman as if you had made her, and lie to her like a god! Do you think you\u0027re big enough to make that seem fair?\" \"Ah, you don\u0027t understand,\" he murmured still staring before him, afraid to stir the fire in her smouldering eyes. \"I\u0027m doing this because I\u0027m so small.\" Her incredulous gasp was almost a repudiation; but she said nothing and he went on: \"Because the love that\u0027s worth perfidies and desertion and all the other personal superlatives will never come my way. I thought it would: yes! once, long ago. But it hasn\u0027t, and it won\u0027t. If I was big enough!\"—he caught his breath—\"Ah, that\u0027s another matter. For that love excuses everything—\u0027red ruin and the breaking up of laws\u0027—because it\u0027s bigger, and better, and more enduring than the world itself. But it isn\u0027t mine.\" He stopped, and faced for an instant the furious blaze of her eyes. Then he said more slowly: \"So the next best thing seemed, for a man like me, to make a good girl\u0027s dreams come true; her dreams of love, and honour, and a man\u0027s desire ... when one is the man, and can.\" \"You\u0027re not the man!\" she cried. \"And it\u0027s wicked and cruel to pretend to be.\" \"Look here!\" he said persuasively. \"Suppose that you were as poor a thing as I am; suppose that you, too, had come to look for no more from love than it means to me, and that some one came along who took you for an angel; a man young and strong and pure with the one great passion of a lifetime showing all over him; and that, in too weak or too kind a moment you had let him take you in his arms, and let him believe then as true the dreams that he had dreamt of you, and sealed with your kisses the vows which he had sworn. Well! when you\u0027d come to realize that all his strength and sweetness hung on his belief in you, would you call it wicked and cruel to go on with the pretence?\" She made no answer for some moments. The grip of her white fingers relaxed upon the couch and the fan hung quiet against her ankle as she continued to absorb him with her devouring eyes. \"You\u0027ve forgotten me,\" she whispered at length. \"No,\" he protested; \"you can\u0027t say that, can you? I told you at once.\" \"Told me what?\" she demanded. \"That I was not free,\" he said. \"Yes,\" she exclaimed, \"the very first time you spoke to me. As if I were certain to lose my heart if I had not been warned. I hated you pretty hotly for it too, I can assure you. And you might have saved yourself the trouble. I\u0027d been told it before.\" \"Before?\" \"Yes, by Ethel Vernon. She said, when she heard I was to meet you, \u0027He\u0027s going to marry a girl that he doesn\u0027t care a sou for.\u0027 How did she know?\" \"She didn\u0027t know,\" he said. \"How did she guess then? Had you been in love with her?\" \"Yes.\" \"She with you?\" \"You forget,\" he said gravely: \"she\u0027s a married woman.\" \"I did forget,\" she smiled. \"And was there no one you were in love with between her and me?\" \"I\u0027m not in love with you,\" he said. She smiled again, drearily. \"Does it do you any good to say that?\" she asked. \"No,\" he answered; \"I said it for you.\" \"For me?\" she objected. \"Yes,\" he replied; \"you said I\u0027d forgotten you.\" \"Do you call that remembering?\" she enquired ruefully. \"Don\u0027t you?\" he murmured. \"Would I have said it for myself?\" \"Said what?\" she asked. \"That I\u0027m not in love with you?\" \"I daresay,\" she said. \"Even if it had not been true?\" She shrugged her shoulders. \"I daresay,\" she said. \"Do you?\" he smiled. \"It\u0027s a good deal to dare.\" He drew a long unsteady breath. \"Well,\" he sighed, \"suppose it wasn\u0027t?\" \"Wasn\u0027t true?\" she said. \"Wasn\u0027t true,\" he repeated slowly. \"Suppose that I\u0027ve—wilfully—lied to you. Suppose that the hour I saw your face brought my lost dreams back to me; suppose that in you I found the woman for want of whom all my days have in despair been wasted; the one woman who could have made life splendid, and love passionate and ceaseless and supreme. Or, no! not even that, not even that! Suppose only that I felt your fascination as any man might feel it; that I was just bewitched by your beauty; that every day without its glamour was the darkness of death, and the thought of other men possessing it an unendurable torment. Suppose which you please, whichever seems to you simplest, or strangest, or most deplorable—and tell me again you think it was for my own sake that I was silent!\" The musing tone in which he had begun was gone before he ended. He had turned to her, even as he leaned a little back and away against the end of the lounge; his shoulders were squared, and his brows drawn above the gray eyes which gazed almost defiantly into her face. And as his mood hardened hers had melted. Darkness had spread again across her eyes; spread as the night above a lighted river—its depths a-glimmer with strange reflections, and her lips had fallen softly apart from their disdainful smile into an unconscious baby sweetness, through which she breathed. She was listening with an absorbed intentness, with all her senses crowding to her ears. Even her splendid carriage was relaxed; her bosom drooped; dark hollows showed about her throat; her chin sank, till the white shoulder on which she leaned almost touched a tiny ear; the fan slipped from her other hand and hung by the loop about her wrist. Her eyes met his as he ended; and, as it were, beneath the long silence of that look he could hear the brushing sound of the breath between her parted lips, like the far-off pulse of the sea. But he missed so the other change which came to her; came, as it were, when the senses which had been away, so tensely listening, returned with their news. They brought back no erectness to her bearing, but deepened and coloured her drooping beauty till its languor became in itself a mien, a seduction that grew more perilous and overpowering with each quickening breath that filled her breast. But of all that Caragh noticed nothing. He saw only those wavering lights in the liquid darkness of her eyes, a darkness that spread about him till he felt the draught and swirl of its unknown waters. It was from that he was taken by the sudden fastening of the girl\u0027s hands about his face, and he woke with a flash of enlightenment to all that was in hers. He tried to shake his head, but she only tightened her fingers about it and drew it towards her, smiling, with a strength that astonished him. \"Don\u0027t,\" he said. But she pressed her wrists against his cheeks till his mouth was crushed between them, and drew him closer; closer to the strange smile upon her lips—cruel, passionate, triumphant, and yet adoringly fond—which seemed to come from beyond the borders of the world he knew. Then, with a bird\u0027s swiftness, her lips were against his face, bruising it with the wildness of her kisses, as she held it in a clutch that pained him to the plundering madness of her mouth. Unable to speak, he caught her wrists to draw them from his face, but at the touch of her skin his hands lost the power to help him, and hung idly like heavy bracelets upon her arms. They had slipped to her elbows and fallen unclasped from them, when, as suddenly as she had seized it, she thrust his face from her to the full length of her arms and held it there, gazing into it with the fury of despoiled possession, which had the same savage strangeness as her smile. Caragh\u0027s eyes were gravely distressed. \"Don\u0027t, don\u0027t!\" he pleaded. Then she opened her hands and threw his face out of them away from her, with a little low crying laugh horrible to hear, and sat, leaning sideways and motionless, her head propped on her wrist, looking away from him across the back of the lounge. Caragh merely straightened himself in the corner where she had flung him. He did not turn to look at her, and said nothing. There was something in what had happened past explaining; its very lawlessness made it natural, put it outside of everything, in a place by itself where there were no measurements, where there was no proportion. He was unconscious of any surprising experience, and did not give a thought to what might be passing in the girl\u0027s mind. And she, sitting there with that wrecked air of passion, seemed as utterly indifferent how she appeared to him. \"You were right,\" he said at length, looking straight before him: \"I\u0027ve done it all for myself.\" She gave him, without turning, a glance from her exhausted eyes, but took no further notice. \"I\u0027m going back because I daren\u0027t fail her. I think too little of myself, God knows, to risk thinking less. Can you understand that? I was falling lower and lower, losing hope that I could ever be constant to anything that loved me. Then she came. It hadn\u0027t mattered with the others. I was only something to them that any one could be. But she was different—different because she had never loved before, and I meant everything to her that love can mean to a woman\u0027s life, everything that is sacred and tender and divine. And I saw in keeping her love pure and happy the one thing that could lift me out of the pit and let me look myself in the face again. It\u0027s the one chance that\u0027s been given me, and if I can\u0027t take it I\u0027m done for. Yes, it\u0027s sheer selfishness, as you said; but I\u0027m going back to her. Do you understand?\" She did not move nor look round at him. \"You love me,\" she said dully. \"It makes no difference,\" he answered. She gave a little mirthless laugh. \"But it will,\" she said; \"it will. You\u0027ll remember me when she can\u0027t understand you, and my kisses when you\u0027re sick of hers, and my arms when she\u0027s asleep beside you. You won\u0027t think then that it makes no difference. You won\u0027t say then that she was the one chance for you. You\u0027ll remember then that a woman loved you whose love was all that you had dreamed. Maurice, Maurice, you\u0027re not the sort of man that makes a saint!\" He turned to her and put out his hand. \"I\u0027m going,\" he said. \"Good-bye!\" She laid her left hand in it. Hers was quite cold, but she shivered as she touched him. \"Will you come back to me ever?\" she asked. He shook his head. \"Never?\" \"Never, never!\" \"If you want me, you must say,\" she went on impassively. \"It won\u0027t matter what I\u0027m doing—I mean if I\u0027m married, or anything. If you want me, I\u0027ll come to you. But you must say. Love ... ah! you don\u0027t know what it means!\" He left her with a pressure of the hand, and she caught a glimpse of him as he groped his way towards the stairs. But she did not stir, nor try to stop him. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3257/89263.html","bookId":597,"book":{"id":597,"title":"The Plague of the Heart","description":"简介： Have you heard, Captain Terrington? cried the girl gaily.
