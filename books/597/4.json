{"id":17940,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"The Durbar had been announced only a few hours previous to Terrington\u0027s return, but Rose Chantry had had the news of it from her husband on the previous evening. Consequently, when Nevile, so long before he was expected, entered the ante-room, she was quite at home with her triumph and only surprised by the chance of thrusting it into his face. When, half ashamed of having harried such a hungry man, she had flown into the mess-room to find food for him, Terrington sat staring at the white chunam walls, softly aglow with the sunlight that blazed outside. A window in one of them framed a space of blue sky, the greenness of a chenar, and, squatted on the ground beneath it, Rose Chantry\u0027s ayah, swinging a glass bead tied to the lowest bough. He was too tired to think of the news he had heard, or to keep his thoughts from following the woman who had told it. He realized with a numb surprise how many memories of her remained in the queer glimmer of that empty room. How much he remembered which he thought to have forgotten, and which, he was not too tired to tell himself, he ought to have forgotten. Whichever way he looked he could see her figure in one of its airy poses, coquettishly sweet or coquettishly defiant; smiling, pouting, mocking, or fancifully grave. The other figures in those groups, men all of them, had faded; hers remained. A white spirit that filled the place for him. He shut his eyes to shut it out; but found the likeness was on the other side of his lids. He lifted them quickly at a laugh from the mess-room doorway through which Rose Chantry was leaning, with a tatty in either hand pressed against her shoulders and her golden head in the gap. \"Didn\u0027t mean to wake you,\" she said, smiling, \"but there\u0027s some cold chikor. Will that do?\" \"Nothing better,\" he replied. \"Well, you\u0027d better have it where you are,\" she announced with a glance across her shoulder; \"they\u0027re hanging a new ceiling cloth in here, and there\u0027s no end of a litter.\" As her head withdrew with a shrill call to the kitmatgah, Sir Colvin and Chantry entered from the verandah. The Commissioner, with the sense of nakedness which men have felt so often since the days of Eve from following a woman\u0027s counsel, wished, on learning of Terrington\u0027s arrival, to confront him personally with the news of the Durbar. So after he had seated himself and listened to what could be told him on the prospects of supply, he put the question with an exaggerated imitation of his own bluffness. \"Well! I suppose you\u0027ve heard of the Durbar?\" \"I\u0027m afraid, sir,\" said the other, \"I\u0027ve been too hungry to hear of anything but breakfast. It\u0027s to be cold chikor,\" he added, smiling, as Rose Chantry, followed by the kitmatgah, made a muslin whiteness in the mess room-door. She heard the cheerful lie with a flash of admiration for the man who spoke it. So many beaten men, she knew, would have jumped at the peevish chance to hit back, especially when the hard truth to hit with was in their hands. \"Well,\" continued Sir Colvin, saluting Mrs. Chantry and reseating himself, as the tray was laid before Terrington, \"I decided, as no reply came to my last demand, some sort of move must be made at once, if we weren\u0027t to be boxed here all the winter. So, as there was no chance of ferreting the Khan out of that hole of his, we\u0027re going to talk him into reason over there.\" Terrington, with his knife in the partridge, looked up and nodded. \"I suppose the plan\u0027s no more to your mind than ever?\" queried the Commissioner. \"No, sir,\" said his military adviser. \"I think it\u0027s even less.\" \"How! from what you\u0027ve heard?\" exclaimed Sir Colvin. \"No,\" said the soldier slowly; \"from what I haven\u0027t heard. There\u0027s no talk in the hills; and when a Sari man\u0027s dumb, he\u0027s either got something to say, or something not to say it.\" \"Hang it all!\" cried Chantry. \"I wonder if there\u0027s anything that you wouldn\u0027t think a bad sign?\" Aire shrugged his shoulders. \"Well! the die\u0027s cast,\" he said; \"and we\u0027ve got to see the thing through. The only question left is one of escort. We want to look imposing but not belligerent. What do you think?\" \"The smaller the better,\" said Terrington drily. \"Why?\" \"You can\u0027t take enough to make it safe for you,\" explained the other; \"but you can take enough to make it unsafe for us.\" \"For you?\" Sir Colvin asked. \"Suppose you don\u0027t come back?\" was Terrington\u0027s reply. \"Gad! but you\u0027re a cheerful counsellor,\" cried Chantry hotly. \"If they murder us, eh,\" said Aire. \"And you think they mean to, Captain Terrington?\" asked Rose Chantry. Terrington shook his head. \"Not to-morrow!\" he said. \"Mir Khan wouldn\u0027t expect to get the chance.\" \"You mean he doesn\u0027t believe we\u0027re such unqualified fools as to go there?\" Sir Colvin suggested. \"That\u0027s probably how he puts it,\" said Terrington blandly. \"Well that gives us a chance the more,\" Chantry threw in. \"A chance the less, I think,\" said Terrington. \"Blood is always a Sari man\u0027s first thought, and he\u0027ll leave no time for a second.\" The agent\u0027s dark eyes glowered with a whole-souled malediction, but Sir Colvin, tapping on the table, watched in silence for some seconds while Terrington finished his meal. \"Do you still try to dissuade me?\" he asked at length. \"Not at all, sir,\" replied the other. \"I was only thinking of the escort. If they mean murder over there they\u0027ll mean it the more the more of you there are.\" \"Why?\" \"Supposing they intend to go for us, they\u0027ll wait till all the passes are closed, and we\u0027re cut off. In that case they\u0027ll hardly give away their game now, unless they get a chance to cripple us.\" \"Twenty men would be enough?\" \"Ample,\" said Terrington. \"And I\u0027d keep as many of them outside as possible.\" \"Yes; and you might pick some of your own men for the job.\" Terrington\u0027s face hardened. His men were his children, and he hated to let them run a risk which he could not share. \"In that case I\u0027d ask the honour of going with you, sir,\" he said. Sir Colvin shook his head. \"No, no!\" he answered. \"The Fort is your business, and it may prove a big one. Chantry is going in with me, and Langford, who\u0027s an old cavalryman, will take the escort. I\u0027ve sent down word of what I\u0027m doing, but I\u0027ll leave a fuller account with you, in case anything goes wrong.\" He turned with Chantry to leave the room, calling back from the doorway: \"By the way, the polo\u0027s to come off to-morrow afternoon as we arranged. You\u0027re playing, aren\u0027t you?\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied the other, watching the two figures pass out of the verandah, and seem to shrink as they were immersed in the fierce yellow of the sun. Then he turned, and met Rose Chantry\u0027s eyes. She had flung herself into a long chair: her knees were crossed; her head thrown back; her hands clasped behind it. To Terrington\u0027s vision the tip of her toe, her knee and her chin were in a line; and the absurd little sole of her shoe, with its elfin instep and the arch curl of its heel, made a print on his memory in which it was afterwards to tread. \"Well!\" she said, with her tantalizing smile, \"was the chikor good?\" \"Excellent,\" he answered. Her lips fluttered like the wings of a bird. \"Didn\u0027t it taste of defeat?\" she suggested, the dark lids drooping over her eyes. \"No,\" he said gravely, \"it tasted extremely game.\" She swept him with her covert glances, but his had fallen to her foot. \"Why did you tell that lie?\" she asked presently. He looked up into her face for an instant. \"I\u0027ve forgotten,\" he said. \"Sir Colvin wouldn\u0027t have suspected me,\" she added. \"He knows no more about a woman than ... than you do. \"I suppose that leaves him without much knowledge to boast of?\" he reflected. \"Yes,\" she said; \"it does.\" She tilted her head sideways to see, beyond her knee, on what his eyes were fixed. She tossed her foot clear of the muslin flounces, and then with a curious twist of the ankle brought it round into her view. \"What\u0027s wrong with it?\" she asked. He shook his head. \"How should I know?\" he said thoughtfully. \"It wasn\u0027t made for me.\" She laughed, slowly twirling her foot, as though fascinated by its suppleness, or by the gleaming creases of the silk that covered it. Then, with a little jerk of her knee, she let it settle again into the froth of flounces. \"Really,\" she said, \"for a man who says so little, you do say the strangest things.\" His eyes had wandered again to the square of open air, the picture in azure and ochre and emerald which the window made in the wall. The brown woman still sat swinging her bead in the shade of the chenar. Terrington could see its glassy blueness as it dipped to and fro across a splinter of sunlight. Rose Chantry, with her eyes on his profile, asked him at what he was looking. He told her. \"I know!\" she exclaimed. \"Why is she always doing that?\" \"She wants a child,\" he said. \"But she has one.\" \"Another then.\" She gave a shudder. \"What strange things women are!\" she cried. His eyes came round to her, and she felt a coldness in them like the green gleam of ice. \"Out here, you see,\" he said quietly, \"women are still as fond of making men as of making fools of them.\" \"Why do you say that?\" she asked sharply. \"I could think of nothing better,\" he replied. \"Why did you say it to me?\" she persisted. \"To whom else could I have said it?\" he enquired blandly. The blaze of anger seemed to fill her eyes with a floating sparkle of fresh colours, and her lips closed tightly, as though to repress a desire to bite him. Then she met his glance and laughed. \"I wonder why you dislike me so,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t dislike you,\" he replied. \"Oh, well!\" she sighed, \"why don\u0027t you dislike me, then; since you seem too? You wish I wasn\u0027t here!\" \"Very much,\" he admitted. \"Why? What harm do I do?\" \"Haven\u0027t you told me that this morning?\" \"No!\" she cried. \"You weren\u0027t thinking of that; you know you weren\u0027t. You believe that would have happened anyhow. It was what you meant about making fools of men.\" \"Well,\" he said, \"don\u0027t you make fools of them?\" She shook her head softly. \"My mistake then,\" he said. \"Ah!\" she sighed, \"but you don\u0027t think so. I daresay you think something much more horrid of me than you care to say. And it ought to have been rather nice for you all, having me up here.\" \"Yes,\" he said, \"I think it ought.\" She looked at him doubtfully, crumpling her lips together in her fingers. \"But you do make mistakes,\" she went on retrospectively. \"Yes,\" he said, \"one makes everything of them.\" She regarded him for a moment in the light of the remark, before adding: \"You told me, the first time you saw me, I must give up riding.\" \"Yes,\" he admitted, smiling; \"that was one of them. But I found that your riding could be of use to us.\" \"Of use to you?\" she exclaimed. \"Yes, in creating a false impression.\" \"An impression of what?\" \"Of security: that we did not think you were in any danger.\" \"Though you thought I was?\" \"I was sure of it,\" he said. She was sitting upright now; her hands set upon the chair-arms; her face changing stormily between anger and astonishment. \"You were sure I was in danger, yet you did nothing to prevent it!\" she cried. \"Do you mean that?\" \"What should I have done?\" he enquired. \"Warned me!\" she said \"But didn\u0027t I?\" \"Oh, that!\" she exclaimed impatiently. \"And would you have been warned?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t say. That\u0027s got nothing to do with it. Or you could have given me an escort.\" He shook his head. \"That would have made you no safer, and would have spoilt you as an advertisement.\" \"As an advertisement!\" she protested hotly. \"Do soldiers let a woman run the risk of being murdered to make things safe far them? I think it\u0027s contemptible!\" \"Yes,\" he said quietly; \"so I see: but you don\u0027t think enough.\" He sat looking at her in a way she detested; as no other man seemed able to look at her; as though she were a piece in a game he played. \"Did any one else know it wasn\u0027t safe for me?\" she demanded. He shook his head. \"Wouldn\u0027t you have been warned in that case?\" he suggested. \"Yes,\" she returned warmly, \"I\u0027m quite certain I should.\" \"I think so too,\" he said. \"Nothing in Sar would have been weighed beside it.\" \"Except by you,\" she retorted. \"Except by me,\" he said. \"You see I\u0027m here to weigh things. I\u0027m here to look after you all. You think I should have told you of your danger, and shut you up in the safety of Sar. But there is no safety in Sar. That\u0027s the mistake. Your riding was a risk, but it helped our chance to make Sar safer; safer for every one, safer for you.\" \"And suppose I had been killed?\" \"Well,\" he said, \"you can fancy what I should have paid for it. But the safety would have been there, though it was only there for others. And it was to make that that I am here.\" She met his musing observation of her with hard clear eyes. \"Haven\u0027t you wasted an unusual lot of time talking to me this morning, Captain Terrington?\" she said. He took the deep breath of a man whose heart is sick for sleep, and threw back his shoulders. \"Yes,\" he smiled, rising; \"I was quite exceptionally tired.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3257/89243.html","bookId":597,"book":{"id":597,"title":"The Plague of the Heart","description":"简介： Have you heard, Captain Terrington? cried the girl gaily.
