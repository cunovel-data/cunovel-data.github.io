{"id":17951,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"That kiss dated naturally a new era in their relations; not outwardly at first, to an appreciable extent, but with a difference immense in implication, in understanding. Terence, forced to stay at Wallingford a day longer than he had intended, tried to put the added time to profit. He saw that the chief danger lay in the hazy country of her expectations. Her life had been turned upside down with joy, its dulness was on fire with an undreamed-of satisfaction; and she neither knew nor cared what might come next, so long as it kept the flame that was lit in her alive. She lived for the unexpected, and she would show no discrimination in accepting it. Everything in that land was so new to her that no one thing seemed more alien than another; nothing had a special air of peril or of safety, of warning or of promise: all things were equally and perturbingly improbable, and supreme. Terence realized how vague suddenly had become all her boundaries of conduct, and desired without delay to fix a frontier beyond which neither of them should go. He would withdraw from nothing that his kiss had even seemed to promise; but he wished to put what it had not inalterably beyond her reach. The optimism of such a hope can only be accounted for by his absolute ignorance of women; but her shyness, in a situation so strange to her, seemed to justify it while he remained at Wallingford. But later, as her letters began to multiply, he realized how profound was his mistake. She rode her fancy wherever it led her, and he might as well have tried to fix a frontier for the north wind. She wrote persistently of his love, of its greatness, its gladness, its splendid illumination of her life. Her exultation in a thing which had no real existence was terrible to Terence. Her dull unhappy being was transformed by a miracle as wonderful as that which creates the glory of painted wings from a withered chrysalis. And he had wrought it. He, by some ignorant magic, had set her life afloat on pinions frailer and more resplendent than a butterfly\u0027s, to touch which roughly was to destroy her. That was, of course, too brutal to be thought of. He must accept what he had done, however little he had meant to do it; must trust to time to dull its marvel and bring the woman back to earth. But there seemed little likelihood of that at first, and with the increasing rapture of her letters Terence grew ever more dismayed. Yet if he tried to lure her down to sanity, an agonized reply would be flung at him by the post\u0027s return, only to make his fears more vivid, and to compel from him, in sheer abasement, an expression of sentiment which he not only did not possess, but would have shrunk from possessing. \"Swear,\" she had written, not once, nor twice; \"swear that you love no other woman; that you have never loved another woman; that I fill all your thoughts!\" Those were easy oaths, and true; but they did not content her. It was not enough that no other woman had a lien upon his past: his whole existence must be proscribed for her. \"Tell me,\" she prayed, \"that I shall be everything to you always! It kills me to think that any love could move you after mine. I cannot have renounced my pride, my honour, my self-respect, for less than that.\" He could but smile unmirthfully at her renunciations. His were privileges, it seemed, to her thinking, that any man might sigh for; though apparently they were to include a monastic seclusion from the world of sense, a virginity devoted, not to her passion—and for passion a man might be content to live or die—but to her sentimental fancies. \"Say,\" she pleaded, unsatisfied by his replies, which to such extortionate demands could be but vague, \"say that I alone of all the women in the world can ever satisfy all your longings; that it would seem a degrading sacrilege to let any other woman come after me even in your thoughts! Tell me, even though I die, that my memory must keep you true.\" He gazed at that for a day to get his breath, but the delay was all too long for hers. \"Write, write,\" she panted, on the morrow; \"I cannot live unless I hear from you. Have you no feeling for a woman\u0027s dignity that you can give me over in this way to its scorn? I fling everything that I possess before you, and you find it not even worth acknowledgment.\" What could he say? How could he answer her? Her blindness was sublime, detestable, ridiculous, as you were pleased to view it; but to blindness one could never refuse a hand. Distressed by a necessity of which he had been the unwitting cause, Terence extended his. But his ignorance mitigated his foreboding; he still trusted to time. Time, however, brought him but little comfort. If her letters became saner, it was only since he had thrown her insanity a sop. When they met a month later his difficulties were increased. At first she had entreated him to win her respect by a display of repression. He was to be as other men were not, to keep her staunch by an undreamed-of virtue. The lover\u0027s heart must animate to her perception only the unimpeachable kindness of the friend. She had her wish, but had it, perhaps, in a perfection for which she was not prepared. She seemed determined to leave no doubts as to his fortitude. She hung upon him so literally that he had to exert not moral fibre only to support her. She drooped like a wreath about his shoulders, while he gazed, grim and ashamed, upon her hair. But she drew no consolation from his strength. It was not strength, she told him, but indifference; she had asked for a sentry, and he had given her a statue. She tried to soften the statue by every feminine artifice, even, at last, by kissing its irresponsive face. He, invincibly simple, smiled at the wiles he thought were used to try him; and stiffened himself into the pose he had been convinced was her desire. If it ever had been, she outlived it before long. Its end was advertised by an hysterical outbreak, which Terence never could recall without a shudder. They were both, at the time, in town, where they met two or three times a week, and he had called to bring her some tickets. She was sitting on a lounge in a remote corner of the room, and gave him her hand with blank indifference. Unequal always to resolve her moods, he sustained a monologue from the fireplace on the trifles of the hour, until her persistent silence compelled him to ask its cause. She replied listlessly, after some pressing, that it must be of no importance since he could ignore it. She had merely been deceived in him, that was all: a common thing with a woman. He had proved himself to be just a man, like every other; and not the man of men she had supposed him. It had amused him, no doubt, to win her love; now, it seemed, he was tired of it. He had spoilt her life, he had destroyed her faith; but such things, of course, weren\u0027t worth mentioning: the great matter was, naturally, that a man should not be bored. Now, she supposed, they might as well end the farce between them, so that he could amuse himself elsewhere. All she had lived for was over for ever, and she did not care what became of her. She poured out the indictment to his bewildered ears in the level tones of utter apathy; but when it was done she flung herself violently across the head of the lounge in a tempest of passionate tears. Terence, despairing of any further fitness or sanity in the affair, resigned himself to the situation with a sigh, and knelt beside her for an hour, until she appeared to draw from his caresses a renewed confidence in life. He left her, sufficiently depressed himself, and expecting anything but a letter which reached him on the morrow by the earliest post. It must have been written very shortly after his departure, which she had done her utmost to delay, yet it proclaimed her as too shamed by what had happened ever to meet him again, unless he felt himself strong enough to prevent such scenes in the future. Feeling strong enough for nothing, he left her letter unanswered for a day, and received, on the next, eight pages of aggrieved reproaches for having forsaken her in the hour of her greatest need. That was but the prelude to many meetings of as strange a kind. He never knew in what mood he should find her, nor in which she might wish to find him. He believed her revulsions of propriety to be sincere, but felt she had no business with so many, especially since he offered her every assistance to avoid the need of them. He respected her for the first, pitied her for the second, endured the third in silence, and then began to hate them. He did not expect a woman to know her own mind, but he thought her ignorance might be more agreeable. So passed what was for Terence a very melancholy winter. He bore it with a resignation nerved by the near prospect of escape to a berth in Paris, which had been as good as promised him when it became vacant. Meanwhile Downing Street saw more of him than usual, and he took every opportunity of immersing himself still deeper in his work. The post he had been expecting became available in March, and, too modest to urge his claim or to remind his patron, he was mortified to find one morning that it had been filled by another. He accepted his ill-fortune silently, and only learnt a month later to whom he owed it. He was enlightened then by accident, the peer, in whose gift the appointment practically lay, happening to express a regret that Terence had not seen his way to accept it. \"To accept it!\" he replied, laughing. \"It wasn\u0027t offered me.\" \"It wasn\u0027t offered you,\" said the other slowly, \"because a certain friend of yours told me you had determined definitely, for the present, not to leave England.\" Terence met the speaker\u0027s searching glance, which smouldered with admonition. \"I see,\" he smiled. \"My own fault entirely.\" He understood to whom the \"certain friend\" referred, as well as the warning against feminine influence in his chief\u0027s eye; and, for a moment of sick disappointment, he burned to confront the woman who had betrayed him with his knowledge of her perfidy, to fling this piece of unimagined baseness in her face, and so be rid of her. But he realized ruefully within an hour that no such release was possible, at least for him. She had but done this thing to keep him near her. She would plead that to stoop to such an act of treachery to the one who was dearest to her only proved how ungovernable was her love. There would be another horrible scene. She would threaten again to kill herself. And in the end he would succumb. Each sacrifice he had made for her only committed him to a fresh one. She had cultivated weakness in order to revel in his strength; he had pauperized her with his soul. Had she been a woman of rages, of pride, of resentments, it would have proved another matter; but how was it possible to hurt a thing that clung about one\u0027s neck. So he said no more of his discomfiture, bitter as it was to his ambition as well as to his hopes of freedom. Her querulous exactions had already alienated his sympathies, so that it was no harder now to be kind to her than it had been before. And he was glad to know definitely what he had to fear from her, even though the definition was so inclusive. He determined to loosen, slowly and gently, those tendrils of sentiment by which she clung to him, which were so enfeebling her self-support. But he saw that he had little to hope for save from time and the natural infidelity of her sex. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3257/89254.html","bookId":597,"book":{"id":597,"title":"The Plague of the Heart","description":"简介： Have you heard, Captain Terrington? cried the girl gaily.
