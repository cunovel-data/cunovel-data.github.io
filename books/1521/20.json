As ever, much remained unsaid between the two friends and soldiers. \"Fabius, I could get used to you helping to save my life. I may have to write a poem in your honour,\" the centurion called out to the recruit. \"Now attend to Teucer, before I have to give you another compliment.\"\n The youth smiled sheepishly and attended to his comrade.\n \"I must thank you too, legionary,\" Oppius remarked to the soldier who had rushed out of the forest with Roscius.\n The soldier turned around, after pulling his javelin out of the barbarian. He was older than Oppius, a veteran. His build was compact, his body marked with scars.\n \"Thank me with a drink, or four, and we\u0027ll be even,\" the veteran replied, grinning as he found a couple of gold coins upon the dead Briton. As he smiled Oppius noticed that one of his front teeth was missing and the other one was chipped.\n \"Lucius, meet Tiro Casca,\" Roscius remarked.\n \"I served a little with your father. He was a good man, tough as leather. It seems you can handle yourself in a fight too. I also saw you on the beach. You\u0027re your father\u0027s son,\" Tiro Casca announced, nodding in approval and respect.\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/standard-bearer-sword-of-rome-1/page-20.html","bookId":1521,"book":{"id":1521,"title":"Standard Bearer (Sword of Rome #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Standard Bearer (Sword of Rome #1) \n Britain, 55 BC. \n Julius Caesar’s invasion of the wild and mineral-rich land is becalmed, a stalemate exists between the forces of Rome and Britain.
