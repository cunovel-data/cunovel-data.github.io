Initially, she does not recognize the brothers due to her confused state, having recently died and risen as a Vampire, but soon a flicker of memory causes her to realize the one she loves is hurt and needs her help. The reader is led to believe she is referring to Stefan. But instead Elena attacks him, and fully intends to kill him for hurting Damon. Stefan, upon recognizing Elena, doesn\u0027t fight back and allows her to bite him. Damon eventually commands her to stop and takes her in search of human blood. Stefan intervenes, not wanting Elena to kill someone, and instead makes her drink Matt\u0027s blood.

Elena is deeply bothered and upset about the way she attacked Stefan...\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vampire-diaries-the-fury-the-vampire-diaries-3.jpg","author":"L.J.
