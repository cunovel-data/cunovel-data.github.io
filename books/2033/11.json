{"id":108764,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Elena watched Mr. Smallwood\u0027s rifle bounce across the grass. She enjoyed the expression on his face as he spun around, looking for what had grabbed it. And she felt the flare of Damon\u0027s approval from across the pool of light, fierce and hot like the pride of a wolf for its cub\u0027s first kill. But when she glimpsed Stefan lying on the ground, she forgot everything else. White fury took her breath away, and she started toward him.\n \"Everybody stop! Just stop everything, right where you are!\"\n The shout was borne toward them along with the sound of tires squealing. Alaric Saltzman\u0027s car nearly spun out as it turned into the staff parking lot and screeched to a halt, and Alaric leaped from the car almost before it stopped moving.\n \"What\u0027s going on here?\" he demanded, striding toward the men.\n At the shout, Elena had pulled back automatically into the shadows. Now, she looked at the men\u0027s faces as they turned toward him. Besides Mr. Smallwood, she recognized Mr. Forbes and Mr. Bennett, Vickie Bennett\u0027s father. The others must be the fathers of the other guys who\u0027d been with Tyler in the Quonset hut, she thought.\n It was one of the strangers who answered the question, in a drawl that couldn\u0027t quite hide the nervousness underneath. \"Well now, we just got a little tired of waiting any longer. We decided to speed things up a bit.\"\n The wolf growled, a low rumbling that rose to a chainsaw snarl. All the men flinched back, and Alaric\u0027s eyes showed white as he noticed the animal for the first time.\n There was another sound, softer and continuous, coming from a figure huddled next to one of the cars. Caroline Forbes was whimpering over and over, \"They said they just wanted to talk to him. They didn\u0027t tell me what they were going to do.\"\n Alaric, with one eye on the wolf, gestured toward her. \"And you were going to let her see this? A young girl? Do you realize the psychological damage that could do?\"\n \"What about the psychological damage when her throat gets ripped out?\" Mr. Forbes returned, and there were shouts of agreement. \"That\u0027s what we\u0027re worried about.\"\n \"Then you\u0027d better worry about getting the right man,\" Alaric said. \"Caroline,\" he added, turning toward the girl, \"I want you to think, Caroline. We didn\u0027t get to finish your sessions. I know when we left off you thought you recognized Stefan. But, are you absolutely positive it was him? Could it have been somebody else, somebody who resembled him?\"\n Caroline straightened, bracing herself against the car and raising a tear-stained face. She looked at Stefan, who was just sitting up, and then at Alaric. \"I...\"\n \"Think, Caroline. You have to be absolutely certain. Is there someone else it could have been, like-\"\n \"Like that guy who calls himself Damon Smith,\" came Meredith\u0027s voice. She was standing beside Alaric\u0027s car, a slim shadow. \"You remember him, Caroline? He came to Alaric\u0027s first party. He looks like Stefan in some ways.\"\n \"Like that guy who calls himself Damon Smith,\" came Meredith\u0027s voice. She was standing beside Alaric\u0027s car, a slim shadow. \"You remember him, Caroline? He came to Alaric\u0027s first party. He looks like Stefan in some ways.\"\n \"Yes... it could have been, I suppose. Everything happened so fast... but it could have been.\"\n \"And you really can\u0027t be sure which it was?\" Alaric said.\n \"No... not absolutely sure.\"\n \"There,\" said Alaric. \"I told you she needed more sessions, that we couldn\u0027t be certain of anything yet. She\u0027s still very confused.\" He was walking, carefully, toward Stefan. Elena realized that the wolf had withdrawn back into the shadows. She could see it, but the men probably couldn\u0027t.\n Its disappearance made them more aggressive. \"What are you talking about? Who is this Smith? I\u0027ve never seen him.\"\n \"But your daughter Vickie probably has, Mr. Bennett,\" Alaric said. \"That may come out in my next session with her. We\u0027ll talk about it tomorrow; it can wait that long. Right now I think I\u0027d better take Stefan to a hospital.\" There was discomforted shifting among some of the men.\n \"Oh, certainly, and while we\u0027re waiting anything could happen,\" began Mr. Smallwood. \"Any time, anywhere-\"\n \"So you\u0027re just going to take the law into your own hands, then?\" Alaric said. His voice sharpened. \"Whether you\u0027ve got the right suspect or not. Where\u0027s your evidence this boy has supernatural powers? What\u0027s your proof? How much of a fight did he even put up?\"\n \"There\u0027s a wolf around somewhere who put up plenty of fight,\" Mr. Smallwood said, red-faced. \"Maybe they\u0027re in it together.\"\n \"I don\u0027t see any wolf. I saw a dog. Maybe one of the dogs that got out of quarantine. But what\u0027s that got to do with it? I\u0027m telling you that in my professional opinion you\u0027ve got the wrong man.\"\n The men were wavering, but there was still some doubt in their faces. Meredith spoke up.\n \"I think you should know that there\u0027ve been vampire attacks in this county before,\" she said. \"A long time before Stefan came here. My grandfather was a victim. Maybe some of you have heard about that.\" She looked across at Caroline.\n That was the end of it. Elena could see the men exchanging uneasy glances and backing toward their cars. Suddenly they all seemed eager to be somewhere else.\n Mr. Smallwood was one who stayed behind to say, \"You said we\u0027d talk about this tomorrow, Saltzman. I want to hear what my son says the next time he\u0027s hypnotized.\"\n Caroline\u0027s father collected her and got in his car fast, muttering something about this all being a mistake and nobody taking it too seriously.\n \"Are you all right? Did they hurt you?\"\n He moved away from Alaric\u0027s supporting arm. \"Somebody hit me from behind while I was talking to Caroline. I\u0027ll be all right-now.\" He shot a glance at Alaric. \"Thanks. Why?\"\n \"He\u0027s on our side,\" said Bonnie, joining them. \"I told you. Oh, Stefan, are you really okay? I thought I was going to faint there for a minute. They weren\u0027t serious. I mean, they couldn\u0027t really have been serious. ...\"\n \"Serious or not, I don\u0027t think we should stay here,\" said Meredith. \"Does Stefan really need a hospital?\"\n \"No,\" Stefan said, as Elena anxiously examined the cut on his head. \"I just need rest. Somewhere to sit down.\"\n \"I\u0027ve got my keys. Let\u0027s go to the history room,\" Alaric said.\n Bonnie was looking around the shadows apprehensively. \"The wolf, too?\" she said, and then jumped as a shadow coalesced and became Damon.\n \"What wolf?\" he said. Stefan turned slightly, wincing.\n \"Thank you, too,\" he said unemotionally. But Stefan\u0027s eyes lingered on his brother with something like puzzlement as they walked to the school building.\n In the hallway, Elena pulled him aside. \"Stefan, why didn\u0027t you notice them coming up behind you? Why were you so weak?\"\n Stefan shook his head evasively, and she added, \"When did you feed last? Stefan, when? You always make some excuse when I\u0027m around. What are you trying to do to yourself?\"\n \"I\u0027m all right,\" he said. \"Really, Elena. I\u0027ll hunt later.\"\n \"Do you promise?\"\n \"I promise.\"\n It didn\u0027t occur to Elena at the moment that they hadn\u0027t agreed on what \"later\" meant. She allowed him to lead her on down the hall.\n The history room looked different at night to Elena\u0027s eyes. There was a strange atmosphere about it, as if the lights were too bright. Just now all the students\u0027 desks were shoved out of the way, and five chairs were pulled up to Alaric\u0027s desk. Alaric, who\u0027d just finished arranging the furniture, urged Stefan into his own padded chair.\n \"Okay, why don\u0027t the rest of you take a seat.\"\n They just looked at him. After a moment Bonnie sank down into a chair, but Elena stood by Stefan, Damon continued to lounge halfway between the group and the door, and Meredith pushed some papers to the center of Alaric\u0027s desk and perched on the corner.\n \"Well,\" said Elena.\n Everyone looked at everyone else. Elena picked up a piece of cotton from the first-aid kit she\u0027d grabbed at the door and began dabbing Stefan\u0027s head with it.\n \"I think it\u0027s time for that explanation,\" she said.\n \"Right. Yes. Well, you all seemed to have guessed I\u0027m not a history teacher...\"\n \"In the first five minutes,\" Stefan said. His voice was quiet and dangerous, and with a jolt Elena realized it reminded her of Damon\u0027s. \"So what are you?\"\n Alaric made an apologetic gesture and said almost diffidently, \"A psychologist. Not the couch kind,\" he added hastily as the rest of them exchanged looks. \"I\u0027m a researcher, an experimental psychologist. From Duke University. You know, where the ESP experiments were started.\"\n \"The ones where they make you guess what\u0027s on the card without looking at it?\" Bonnie asked.\n \"Yes, well, it\u0027s gone a bit beyond that now, of course. Not that I wouldn\u0027t love to test you with Rhine cards, especially when you\u0027re in one of those trances.\" Alaric\u0027s face lit with scientific inquiry. Then he cleared his throat and went on. \"But-ah-as I was saying. It started a couple of years ago when I did a paper on parapsychology. I wasn\u0027t trying to prove supernatural powers existed, I just wanted to study what their psychological effect is on the people who have them. Bonnie, here, is a case in point.\" Alaric\u0027s voice took on a lecturer\u0027s tone. \"What does it do to her, mentally, emotionally, to have to deal with these powers?\"\n \"It\u0027s awful,\" Bonnie interrupted vehemently. \"I don\u0027t want them anymore. I hate them.\"\n \"Well, there you see,\" Alaric said. \"You\u0027d have made a great case study. My problem was that I couldn\u0027t find anybody with real psychic powers to examine. There were plenty of fakers, all right-crystal healers, dowsers, channelers, you name it. But I couldn\u0027t find anything genuine until I got a tip from a friend in the police department.\n \"There was this woman down in South Carolina who claimed she\u0027d been bitten by a vampire, and since then she was having psychic nightmares. By that time I was so used to fakes I expected her to turn out to be one, too. But she wasn\u0027t, at least not about being bitten. I never could prove she was really psychic.\"\n \"How could you be sure she\u0027d been bitten?\" Elena asked.\n \"There was medical evidence. Traces of saliva in her wounds that were similar to human saliva-but not quite the same. It contained an anticoagulatory agent similar to that found in the saliva of leeches...\" Alaric caught himself and hurried on.\n \"Anyway, I was sure. And that was how it started. Once I was convinced something had really happened to the woman, I started to look up other cases like hers. There weren\u0027t a lot of them, but they were out there. People who\u0027d encountered vampires.\n \"But you\u0027ve never actually seen a vampire,\" Elena interrupted. \"Until now, I mean. Is that right?\"\n \"Well-no. Not in the flesh, as it were. But I\u0027ve written monographs... and things.\" His voice trailed off.\n Elena bit her lip. \"What were you doing with the dogs?\" she asked. \"At the church, when you were waving your hands at them.\"\n \"Oh...\" Alaric looked embarrassed. \"I\u0027ve picked up a few things here and there, you know. That was a spell an old mountain man showed me for fending off evil. I thought it might work.\"\n \"You\u0027ve got a lot to learn,\" said Damon.\n \"Obviously,\" Alaric said stiffly. Then he grimaced. \"Actually, I figured that out right after I got here. Your principal, Brian Newcastle, had heard of me. He knew about the studies I do. When Tanner was killed and Dr. Feinberg found no blood in the body and lacerations made by teeth in the neck... well, they gave me a call. I thought it could be a big break for me-a case with the vampire still in the area. The only problem was that once I got here I realized they expected me to take care of the vampire. They didn\u0027t know I\u0027d dealt only with the victims before. And... well, maybe I was in over my head. But I did my best to justify their confidence-\"\n \"You faked it,\" Elena accused. \"That was what you were doing when I heard you talking to them at your house about finding our supposed lair and all that. You were just winging it.\"\n \"Well, not completely,\" Alaric said. \"Theoretically, I am an expert.\" Then he did a double take. \"What do you mean, when you heard me talking to them?\"\n \"While you were out searching for a lair, she was sleeping in your attic,\" Damon informed him dryly. Alaric opened his mouth and then shut it again.\n \"What I\u0027d like to know is how Meredith comes into all this,\" Stefan said. He wasn\u0027t smiling.\n Meredith, who had been gazing thoughtfully at the jumble of papers on Alaric\u0027s desk during all this, looked up. She spoke evenly, without emotion.\n \"I recognized him, you see. I couldn\u0027t remember where I\u0027d seen him at first, because it was almost three years ago. Then I realized it was at Granddad\u0027s hospital. What I told those men was the truth, Stefan. My grandfather was attacked by a vampire.\"\n There was a little silence and then Meredith went on. \"It happened a long time ago, before I was born. He wasn\u0027t badly hurt by it, but he never really got well. He became... well, sort of like Vickie, only more violent. It got so that they were afraid he\u0027d harm himself, or somebody else. So they took him to a hospital, a place he\u0027d be safe.\"\n ago, before I was born. He wasn\u0027t badly hurt by it, but he never really got well. He became... well, sort of like Vickie, only more violent. It got so that they were afraid he\u0027d harm himself, or somebody else. So they took him to a hospital, a place he\u0027d be safe.\"\n \"I know. I could have... but I couldn\u0027t. The family\u0027s kept it a secret so long-or tried anyway. From what Caroline wrote in her diary, she\u0027d obviously heard. The thing is, nobody ever believed Granddad\u0027s stories about the vampire. They just thought it was another of his delusions, and he had a lot of them. Even I didn\u0027t believe them... until Stefan came. And then-I don\u0027t know, my mind started to put little things together. But I didn\u0027t really believe what I was thinking until you came back, Elena.\"\n \"I\u0027m surprised you didn\u0027t hate me,\" Elena said softly.\n \"How could I? I know you, and I know Stefan. I know you\u0027re not evil.\" Meredith didn\u0027t glance at Damon; he might as well not have been present for all the acknowledgment she gave him. \"But when I remembered seeing Alaric talking to Granddad at the hospital I knew he wasn\u0027t, either. I just didn\u0027t know exactly how to get all of you together to prove it.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t recognize you, either,\" Alaric said. \"The old man had a different name- he\u0027s your mother\u0027s father, right? And I may have seen you hanging around the waiting room sometime, but you were just a kid with skinny legs then. You\u0027ve changed,\" he added appreciatively.\n Bonnie coughed, a pointed sound.\n Elena was trying to arrange things in her mind. \"So what were those men doing out there with a stake if you didn\u0027t tell them to be?\"\n \"I had to ask Caroline\u0027s parents for permission to hypnotize her, of course. And I reported what I found to them. But if you\u0027re thinking I had anything to do with what happened tonight, you\u0027re wrong. I didn\u0027t even know about it.\"\n \"I\u0027ve told him about what we\u0027ve been doing, how we\u0027ve been looking for the Other Power,\" Meredith said. \"And he wants to help.\"\n \"I said I might help,\" Alaric said cautiously.\n \"Wrong,\" said Stefan. \"You\u0027re either with us or against us. I\u0027m grateful for what you did out there, talking to those men, but the fact remains that you started a lot of this trouble in the first place. Now you have to decide: are you on our side-or theirs?\"\n Alaric looked around at each of them, at Meredith\u0027s steady gaze and Bonnie\u0027s raised eyebrows, at Elena kneeling on the floor and at Stefan\u0027s already-healing scalp. Then he turned to glance at Damon, who was leaning against the wall, dark and saturnine. \"I\u0027ll help,\" he said at last. \"Hell, it\u0027s the ultimate case study.\"\n \"All right, then,\" Elena said. \"You\u0027re in. Now, what about Mr. Smallwood tomorrow? What if he wants you to hypnotize Tyler again?\"\n \"Wait,\" said Stefan. \"There shouldn\u0027t be a dance, not if there\u0027s any way to prevent it. You\u0027re on good terms with the principal; you can talk to the school board. Make them cancel it.\"\n Alaric looked startled. \"You think something\u0027s going to happen?\"\n \"Yes,\" Stefan said. \"Not just because of what\u0027s happened at the other public functions, but because something\u0027s building up. It\u0027s been building up all week; I can feel it.\"\n \"So can I,\" Elena said. She hadn\u0027t realized it until that moment, but the tension she felt, the sense of urgency, was not just from inside her. It was outside, all around. It thickened the air. \"Something\u0027s going to happen, Alaric.\n Alaric let out his breath in a soft whistle. \"Well, I can try to convince them, but-I don\u0027t know. Your principal is dead set on keeping everything looking normal. And it isn\u0027t as if I can give any rational explanation for wanting to shut it down.\"\n \"Try hard,\" Elena said.\n \"I will. And meanwhile, maybe you should think about protecting yourself. If what Meredith says is right, then most of the attacks have been on you and people close to you. Your boyfriend got dropped in a well; your car got chased into the river; your memorial service was broken up. Meredith says even your little sister was threatened. If something\u0027s going to happen tomorrow, you might want to leave town.\"\n It was Elena\u0027s turn to be startled. She had never thought of the attacks in that way, but it was true. She heard Stefan\u0027s indrawn breath and felt his fingers tighten on hers.\n \"He\u0027s right,\" Stefan said. \"You should leave, Elena. I can stay here until-\"\n \"No. I\u0027m not going without you. And,\" Elena continued, slowly, thinking it out, \"I\u0027m not going anywhere until we find the Other Power and stop it.\" She looked up at him earnestly, speaking quickly now. \"Oh, Stefan, don\u0027t you see, nobody else even has a chance against it. Mr. Smallwood and his friends don\u0027t have a clue. Alaric thinks you can fight it by waving your hands at it. None of them know what they\u0027re up against. We\u0027re the only ones who can help.\"\n She could see the resistance in Stefan\u0027s eyes and feel it in the tenor of his muscles. But as she kept on looking straight at him, she saw his objections fall one by one. For the simple reason that it was the truth, and Stefan hated lying.\n \"All right,\" he said at last, painfully. \"But as soon as this is all over, we\u0027re leaving. I\u0027m not having you stay in a town where vigilantes run around with stakes.\"\n \"Yes.\" Elena returned the pressure of his fingers with hers. \"Once this is all over, we\u0027ll go.\"\n Stefan turned to Alaric. \"And if there\u0027s no way to talk them out of having the dance tomorrow, I think we should keep an eye on it. If something does happen, we may be able to stop it before it gets out of hand.\"\n Elena tilted a doubtful eye toward Bonnie. \"Well... it would mean missing the dance itself-for those of us who could have gone, I mean.\"\n Bonnie drew herself up. \"Oh, who cares about missing a dance?\" she said indignantly. \"What on earth does a dance matter to anyone?\"\n \"Right,\" said Stefan gravely. \"Then it\u0027s settled.\" A spasm of pain seemed to overtake him and he winced, looking down. Elena was immediately concerned.\n \"You need to get home and rest,\" she said. \"Alaric, can you drive us? It\u0027s not that far.\"\n Stefan protested that he was perfectly able to walk, but in the end he gave in. At the boardinghouse, after Stefan and Damon had gotten out of the car, Elena leaned in Alaric\u0027s window for one last question. It had been gnawing at her mind ever since Alaric had told them his story.\n \"About those people who\u0027d encountered vampires,\" she said. \"Just what were the psychological effects? I mean, did they all go crazy or have nightmares? Were any of them okay?\"\n \"It depends on the individual,\" Alaric said. \"And with how many contacts they\u0027d had, and what kind of contacts they were. But mostly just with the personality of the victim, with how well the individual mind can cope.\"\n Elena nodded, and said nothing until the lights of Alaric\u0027s car had been swallowed by the snowy air. Then she turned to Stefan.\n \"Matt.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-fury-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-11.html","bookId":2033,"book":{"id":2033,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Fury (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: \n This book begins with the newly \"turned\" Elena watching Damon and Stefan engaged in a fight to the death.
