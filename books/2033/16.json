I said I didn\u0027t want it at first, because I didn\u0027t know what to do with it. But now I think I have an idea.\\n\\n People are starting to forget already. They\u0027re getting the details wrong, and adding things they just imagined. And, most of all, they\u0027re making up explanations. Why it wasn\u0027t really supernatural, why there\u0027s a rational reason for this or that. It\u0027s just silly, but there\u0027s no way to stop them, especially the adults.\\n\\n They\u0027re the worst. They\u0027re saying the dogs were hydrophobic or something. The vet\u0027s come up with a new name for it, some kind of rabies that\u0027s spread by bats. Meredith says that\u0027s ironic. I think it\u0027s just stupid.\\n\\n The kids are a little better, especially the ones who were at the dance. There are some I think we can rely on, like Sue Carson and Vickie. Vickie\u0027s changed so much in the last two days that it\u0027s like a miracle. She\u0027s not the way she\u0027s been for the last two and a half months, but she\u0027s not the way she used to be, either. She used to be pretty much of a bimbo, running around with the tough crowd. But now I think she\u0027s okay.\\n\\n Even Caroline wasn\u0027t so bad today. She didn\u0027t talk at the other service, but she talked at this one. She said Elena was the real snow queen, which was kind of cribbing off of Sue\u0027s speech from before, but probably the best Caroline could do. It was a nice gesture.\\n\\n Elena looked so peaceful. Not like a wax doll, but as if she were sleeping. I know everybody says that, but it\u0027s true. This time, it really is true.\\n\\n But afterward people were talking about \"her remarkable escape from drowning\" and stuff like that. And saying she died of an embolism or something. Which is absolutely ridiculous. But that\u0027s what gave me the idea.\\n\\n I\u0027m going to get her other diary out of her closet. And then I\u0027m going to ask Mrs. Grimesby to put them in the library, not in a case like Honoria Fell\u0027s, but where people can pick them up and read them. Because the truth is in here. This is where the real story is. And I don\u0027t want anybody to forget it.\\n\\n I think maybe the kids will remember.\\n\\n I suppose I should put what happened to the rest of the people around here; Elena would want that. Aunt Judith is okay, although she\u0027s one of the adults who can\u0027t deal with the truth. She needs a rational explanation. She and Robert are going to get married at Christmas. That should be good for Margaret.\\n\\n Margaret\u0027s got the right idea. She told me at the service that she\u0027s going to go see Elena and her parents someday, but not now, because there were a lot of things she still had to do right here. I don\u0027t know what put that idea into her head.\\n\\n She\u0027s smart for a four-year-old.\\n\\n Typical, absolutely typical. Everybody else gets the guys. I\u0027m thinking of trying one of my grandmother\u0027s rituals, just to see if I\u0027ll ever get married at all. There isn\u0027t even anybody I want to marry around here.\\n\\n Well, there\u0027s Matt. Matt\u0027s nice. But right now he\u0027s only got one girl on his mind. I don\u0027t know if that will ever change.\\n\\n He punched Tyler in the nose after the service today, because Tyler said something off-color about her. Tyler is one person I know will never change, no matter what. He\u0027ll always be the mean, obnoxious jerk he is now.\\n\\n But Matt-well, Matt\u0027s eyes are awfully blue. And he\u0027s got a terrific right hook.\\n\\n Stefan couldn\u0027t hit Tyler because he wasn\u0027t there. There are still plenty of people in town who think he killed Elena. He must have, they say, because there was nobody else there. Katherine\u0027s ashes were scattered all over by the time the rescuers got to the crypt. Stefan says it\u0027s because she was so old that she flamed up like that. He says he should have realized the first time, when Katherine pretended to burn, that a young vampire wouldn\u0027t turn to ashes that way. She\u0027d just die, like Elena. Only the old ones crumble.\\n\\n Some people-especially Mr. Smallwood and his friends-would probably blame Damon if they could get hold of him. But they can\u0027t. He wasn\u0027t there when they reached the tomb, because Stefan helped him get away. Stefan won\u0027t say where, but I think to someplace in the woods. Vampires must heal fast because today when I met him after the service, Stefan said that Damon had left Fell\u0027s Church. He wasn\u0027t happy about it; I think Damon didn\u0027t tell him. Now the question seems to be: What is Damon doing? Out biting innocent girls? Or is he reformed? I wouldn\u0027t lay bets on it either way. Damon was a strange guy.\\n\\n But gorgeous. Definitely gorgeous.\\n\\n Stefan won\u0027t say where he\u0027s going, either. But I have a sneaking suspicion Damon may get a surprise if he looks behind him. Apparently, Elena made Stefan promise to watch out for him or something. And Stefan takes promises very, very seriously.\\n\\n I wish him luck. But he\u0027ll be doing what Elena wanted him to, which I think will make him happy. As happy as he can be here without her. He\u0027s wearing her ring on a chain around his neck now.\\n\\n If you think any of this sounds frivolous or as if I don\u0027t care about Elena, that just shows how wrong you are. I dare anybody to say that to me. Meredith and I cried all day Saturday, and most of Sunday. And I was so angry I wanted to rip things apart and break them. I kept thinking, why Elena? Why? When there were\\n\\n so many other people who could have died that night. Out of the whole town, she was the only one.\\n\\n Oh, I\u0027m starting to cry again. That\u0027s what happens when you think about life being fair. And I can\u0027t explain why it isn\u0027t. I\u0027d like to go bang on Honoria Fell\u0027s tomb and ask her if she can explain, but she wouldn\u0027t talk to me. I don\u0027t think it\u0027s something anybody knows.\\n\\n I loved Elena. And I\u0027m going to miss her terribly. The whole school is. It\u0027s like a light that\u0027s gone out. Robert says that\u0027s what her name means in Latin, \"light.\"\\n\\n Now there\u0027ll always be a part of me where the light has gone away.\\n\\n I wish I\u0027d been able to say good-bye to her, but Stefan says she sent her love to me. I\u0027m going to try to think of that as a light to take with me.\\n\\n I\u0027d better stop writing now. Stefan\u0027s leaving, and Matt and Meredith and Alaric and I are going to see him off. I didn\u0027t mean to get so into this; I\u0027ve never kept a journal myself. But I want people to know the truth about Elena. She wasn\u0027t a saint. She wasn\u0027t always sweet and good and honest and agreeable. But she was strong and loving and loyal to her friends, and in the end she did the most unselfish thing anybody could do. Meredith says it means she chose light over darkness. I want people to know that so they\u0027ll always remember.\\n\\n I always will. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-fury-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-16.html","bookId":2033,"book":{"id":2033,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Fury (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: This book begins with the newly \"turned\" Elena watching Damon and Stefan engaged in a fight to the death. Initially, she does not recognize the brothers due to her confused state, having recently died and risen as a Vampire, but soon a flicker of memory causes her to realize the one she loves is hurt and needs her help. The reader is led to believe she is referring to Stefan. But instead Elena attacks him, and fully intends to kill him for hurting Damon. Stefan, upon recognizing Elena, doesn\u0027t fight back and allows her to bite him. Damon eventually commands her to stop and takes her in search of human blood. Stefan intervenes, not wanting Elena to kill someone, and instead makes her drink Matt\u0027s blood. Afterwards, Damon hides her in Alaric Saltzman\u0027s attic and once she has rested, her disorientation begins to lift.
