{"id":108767,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Elena watched Damon with mute dread. She knew that disturbing smile too well. But even as her heart sank, her mind threw a mocking question at her. What difference did it make? She and Stefan were going to die anyway. It only made sense for Damon to save himself. And it was wrong to expect him to go against his nature.\\n\\n She watched that beautiful, capricious smile with a feeling of sorrow for what Damon might have been.\\n\\n Katherine smiled back at him, enchanted. \"We\u0027ll be so happy together. Once they\u0027re dead, I\u0027ll let you go. I didn\u0027t mean to hurt you, not really. I just got angry.\" She put out a slender hand and stroked his cheek. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n \"Katherine,\" he said. He was still smiling.\\n\\n \"Yes.\" She leaned closer.\\n\\n \"Katherine...\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Damon?\"\\n\\n \"Go to hell.\"\\n\\n Elena flinched from what happened next before it happened, feeling the violent upsurge of Power, of malevolent, unbridled Power. She screamed at the change in Katherine. That lovely face was twisting, mutating into something that was neither human nor animal. A red light blazed in Katherine\u0027s eyes as she fell on Damon, her fangs sinking into his throat.\\n\\n Talons sprang from her fingertips, and she raked Damon\u0027s already-bleeding chest with it, tearing into his skin while the blood flowed. Elena kept screaming, realizing dimly that the pain in her arms was from fighting the ropes that held her. She heard Stefan shouting, too, but above everything she heard the deafening shriek of Katherine\u0027s mental voice.\\n\\n Now you\u0027ll be sorry! Now I\u0027m going to make you sorry! I\u0027ll kill you! I\u0027ll kill you! I\u0027ll kill you! I\u0027ll kill you!\\n\\n The words themselves hurt, like daggers stabbing into Elena\u0027s mind. The sheer Power of it stupefied her, rocking her back against the iron pickets. But there was no way to get away from it. It seemed to echo from all around her, hammering in her skull.\\n\\n Kill you! Kill you! Kill you!\\n\\n Elena fainted.\\n\\n Meredith, crouched beside Aunt Judith in the utility room, shifted her weight, straining to interpret the sounds outside the door. The dogs had gotten into the cellar; she wasn\u0027t sure how, but from the bloody muzzles of some of them, she\\n\\n thought they had broken through the ground-level windows. Now they were outside the utility room, but Meredith couldn\u0027t tell what they were doing. It was too quiet out there.\\n\\n \"Hush,\" Robert whispered quickly. \"It\u0027s all right, sweetheart. Everything\u0027s going to be all right.\"\\n\\n Meredith met his frightened, determined eyes over Margaret\u0027s tow head. We almost had you pegged for the Other Power, she thought. But there was no time to regret it now.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Elena? Elena said she\u0027d watch over me,\" Margaret said, her eyes large and solemn. \"She said she\u0027d take care of me.\" Aunt Judith put a hand to her mouth.\\n\\n \"She is taking care of you,\" Meredith whispered. \"She just sent me to do it, that\u0027s all. It\u0027s the truth,\" she added fiercely, and saw Robert\u0027s look of reproach melt into perplexity.\\n\\n Outside, the silence had given way to scratching and gnawing sounds. The dogs were at work on the door.\\n\\n Robert cradled Margaret\u0027s head closer to his chest.\\n\\n Bonnie didn\u0027t know how long they had been working. Hours, certainly. Forever, it seemed like. The dogs had gotten in through the kitchen and the old wooden side doors. So far, though, only about a dozen had gotten past the fires lit like barricades in front of these openings. And the men with guns had taken care of most of those.\\n\\n But Mr. Smallwood and his friends were now holding empty rifles. And they were running out of things to burn.\\n\\n Vickie had gotten hysterical a little while ago, screaming and holding her head as if something was hurting her. They\u0027d been looking for ways to restrain her when she finally passed out.\\n\\n Bonnie went up to Matt, who was looking out over the fire through the demolished side door. He wasn\u0027t looking for dogs, she knew, but for something else much farther away. Something you couldn\u0027t see from here.\\n\\n \"You had to go, Matt,\" she said. \"There was nothing else you could do.\" He didn\u0027t answer or turn around.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s almost dawn,\" she said. \"Maybe when that comes, the dogs will leave.\" But even as she said it, she knew it wasn\u0027t true.\\n\\n Matt didn\u0027t answer. She touched his shoulder. \"Stefan\u0027s with her. Stefan\u0027s there.\"\\n\\n At last, Matt gave some response. He nodded. \"Stefan\u0027s there,\" he said.\\n\\n Brown and snarling, another shape charged out of the dark.\\n\\n It was much later when Elena came gradually to consciousness. She knew because she could see, not just by the handful of candles Katherine had lit but also by the cold gray dimness that filtered down from the crypt\u0027s opening.\\n\\n Damon? she thought. It was only after she had done it that she realized the word had not been spoken. Somehow, Katherine\u0027s shrieking had closed a circuit in her mind, or maybe it had awakened something sleeping. And Matt\u0027s blood had undoubtedly helped, giving her the strength to finally find her mental voice.\\n\\n She turned her head the other way. Stefan?\\n\\n His face was haggard with pain, but aware. Too aware. Elena almost wished that he were as insensible as Damon to what was happening to them.\\n\\n Elena, he returned.\\n\\n Where is she? Elena said, her eyes moving slowly around the room.\\n\\n Stefan looked toward the opening of the crypt. She went up there a while ago.\\n\\n Maybe to check on how the dogs are doing.\\n\\n Elena had thought she\u0027d reached the limit of fear and dread, but it wasn\u0027t true. She hadn\u0027t remembered the others then.\\n\\n Elena, I\u0027m sorry. Stefan\u0027s face was filled with what no words could express.\\n\\n It\u0027s not your fault, Stefan. You didn\u0027t do this to her. She did it to herself. Or-it just happened to her, because of what she is. What we are. Running beneath Elena\u0027s thoughts was the memory of how she had attacked Stefan in the woods, and how she had felt when she was racing toward Mr. Smallwood, planning her revenge. It could have been me, she said.\\n\\n No! You could never become like that.\\n\\n Elena didn\u0027t answer. If she had the Power now, what would she do to Katherine?\\n\\n What wouldn\u0027t she do to her? But she knew it would only upset Stefan more to talk about it.\\n\\n I thought Damon was going to betray us, she said.\\n\\n I did, too, said Stefan queerly. He was looking at his brother with an odd expression.\\n\\n Do you still hate him?\\n\\n Stefan\u0027s gaze darkened. No, he said quietly. No, I don\u0027t hate him anymore. Elena nodded. It was important, somehow. Then she started, her nerves hyper-alert, as something shadowed the entrance to the crypt. Stefan tensed, too. She\u0027s coming. Elena- I love you, Stefan, Elena said hopelessly, as the misty white shape hurtled down. Katherine took form in front of them.\\n\\n Of course, thought Elena. How could I have been so stupid? Damon rode with us\\n\\n in Alaric\u0027s car over the river. He crossed running water then, and probably lots of other times. He couldn\u0027t have been the Other Power.\\n\\n It was strange how she could think even though she was so frightened. It was as if one part of her mind stood watching from a distance.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to kill you now,\" Katherine said conversationally. \"Then I\u0027m going under the river to kill your friends. I don\u0027t think the dogs have done it yet. But I\u0027ll take care of it myself.\"\\n\\n \"Let Elena go,\" said Stefan. His voice was quenched but compelling all the same.\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t decided how to do it,\" said Katherine, ignoring him. \"I might roast you. There\u0027s almost enough light for that now. And I\u0027ve got these.\" She reached down the front of her gown and brought her closed hand out. \"One-two-three!\" she said, dropping two silver rings and a gold one onto the ground. Their stones shone blue as Katherine\u0027s eyes, blue as the stone in the necklace at Katherine\u0027s throat.\\n\\n Elena\u0027s hands twisted frantically and she felt the smooth bareness of her ring finger. It was true. She wouldn\u0027t have believed how naked she felt without that circlet of metal. It was necessary to her life, to her survival. Without it-\\n\\n \"Without these you\u0027ll die,\" Katherine said, scuffing the rings carelessly with the toe of one foot. \"But I don\u0027t know if that\u0027s slow enough.\" She paced back almost to the far wall of the crypt, her silver dress shimmering in the dim light.\\n\\n It was then that the idea came to Elena.\\n\\n She could move her hands. Enough to feel one with the other, enough to know that they weren\u0027t numb anymore. The ropes were looser.\\n\\n But Katherine was strong. Unbelievably strong. And faster than Elena, too. Even if Elena got free she would have time for only one quick act.\\n\\n She rotated one wrist, feeling the ropes give.\\n\\n \"There are other ways,\" Katherine said. \"I could cut you and watch you bleed. I like watching.\"\\n\\n Gritting her teeth, Elena exerted pressure against the rope. Her hand was bent at an excruciating angle, but she continued to press. She felt the burn of the rope slipping aside.\\n\\n \"Or rats,\" Katherine was saying pensively. \"Rats could be fun. I could tell them when to start and when to stop.\"\\n\\n Working the other hand free was much easier. Elena tried to give no sign of what was going on behind her back. She would have liked to call to Stefan with her mind, but she didn\u0027t dare. Not if there was any chance Katherine might hear.\\n\\n but she didn\u0027t dare. Not if there was any chance Katherine might hear.\\n\\n There was a rectangle of gray light on the floor. Dawn light. It was coming in through the crypt\u0027s opening. Katherine had already been out in that light. But...\\n\\n Katherine smiled suddenly, her blue eyes sparkling. \"I know! I\u0027ll drink you almost up and make you watch while I kill her! I\u0027ll leave you just enough strength so you see her die before you do. Doesn\u0027t that sound like a good plan?\" Blithely, she clapped her hands and pirouetted again, dancing away.\\n\\n Just one more step, thought Elena. She saw Katherine approach the rectangle of light. Just one more step...\\n\\n Katherine took the step. \"That\u0027s it, then!\" She started to turn around. \"What a good-\"\\n\\n Now!\\n\\n Yanking her cramped arms out of the last loops of rope, Elena rushed her. It was like the rush of a hunting cat. One desperate sprint to reach the prey. One chance. One hope.\\n\\n She struck Katherine with her full weight. The impact knocked them both into the rectangle of light. She felt Katherine\u0027s head crack against the stone floor.\\n\\n And felt the searing pain, as if her own body had been plunged into poison. It was a feeling like the burning dryness of hunger, only stronger. A thousand times stronger. It was unbearable.\\n\\n \"Elena!\" Stefan screamed, with mind and voice.\\n\\n Stefan, she thought. Beneath her Power surged as Katherine\u0027s stunned eyes focused. Her mouth twisted with rage, fangs bursting forth. They were so long they cut into the lower lip. That distorted mouth opened in a howl.\\n\\n Elena\u0027s clumsy hand fumbled at Katherine\u0027s throat. Her fingers closed on the cool metal of Katherine\u0027s blue necklace. With all her strength, she wrenched and felt the chain give way. She tried to clasp it, but her fingers felt thick and uncoordinated and Katherine\u0027s clawing hand scrabbled at it wildly. It spun away into the shadows.\\n\\n \"Elena!\" Stefan called again in that dreadful voice.\\n\\n She felt as if her body were filled with light. As if she were transparent. Only, light was pain. Beneath her, Katherine\u0027s warped face was looking up directly into the winter sky. Instead of a howl, there was a shrieking that went up and up.\\n\\n Elena tried to lift herself off, but she didn\u0027t have the strength. Katherine\u0027s face was rifting, cracking open. Lines of fire opened in it. The screaming reached a crescendo. Katherine\u0027s hair was aflame, her skin was blackening. Elena felt fire from both above and below.\\n\\n She saw Stefan\u0027s arms, red where they had been exposed to the sun and bleeding where he had torn free of his ropes. She saw his face, saw the stricken horror and grief. Then her eyes blurred and she saw nothing.\\n\\n Meredith and Robert, striking at the blood-soaked muzzles that thrust through the hole in the door, paused in confusion. The teeth had stopped snapping and tearing. One muzzle jerked and slid out of the way. Edging sideways to look at the other, Meredith saw that the dog\u0027s eyes were glazed and milky. They didn\u0027t move. She looked at Robert, who stood panting.\\n\\n There was no more noise from the cellar. Everything was silent.\\n\\n But they didn\u0027t dare to hope.\\n\\n Vickie\u0027s demented shrieking stopped as if it had been cut with a knife. The dog, which had sunk its teeth into Matt\u0027s thigh, stiffened and gave a convulsive shudder; then, its jaws released him. Gasping for breath, Bonnie swung to look beyond the dying fire. There was just enough light to see bodies of other dogs lying where they had fallen outside.\\n\\n She and Matt leaned on each other, looking around, bewildered.\\n\\n It had finally stopped snowing.\\n\\n Slowly, Elena opened her eyes.\\n\\n Everything was very clear and calm.\\n\\n She was glad the shrieking was over. That had been bad; it had hurt. Now, nothing hurt. She felt as if her body were filled with light again, but this time there was no pain. It was as if she were floating, very high and easy, on wafts of air. She almost felt she didn\u0027t have a body at all.\\n\\n She smiled.\\n\\n Turning her head didn\u0027t hurt, although it increased the loose, floating feeling. She saw, in the oblong of pale light on the floor, the smoldering remains of a silvery dress. Katherine\u0027s lie of five hundred years ago had become the truth.\\n\\n That was that, then. Elena looked away. She didn\u0027t wish anyone harm now, and she didn\u0027t want to waste time on Katherine. There were so many more important things.\\n\\n \"Stefan,\" she said and sighed, and smiled. Oh, this was nice. This must be how a bird felt.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t mean for things to turn out this way,\" she said, softly rueful. His green eyes were wet. They filled again, but he returned her smile.\\n\\n \"I know,\" he said. \"I know, Elena.\"\\n\\n It seemed to her that it had been a long while since she\u0027d really looked at him.\\n\\n Since she\u0027d taken time to appreciate how beautiful he was, with his dark hair and his eyes as green as oak leaves. But she saw it now, and she saw his soul shining through those eyes. It was worth it, she thought. I didn\u0027t want to die; I don\u0027t want to now. But I\u0027d do it all over again if I had to.\\n\\n \"I love you,\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"I love you,\" he said, squeezing their joined hands.\\n\\n The strange, languorous lightness cradled her gently. She could scarcely feel Stefan holding her.\\n\\n She would have thought she\u0027d be terrified. But she wasn\u0027t, not as long as Stefan was there.\\n\\n \"The people at the dance-they\u0027ll be all right now, won\u0027t they?\" she said.\\n\\n \"They\u0027ll be all right now,\" Stefan whispered. \"You saved them.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t get to say good-bye to Bonnie and Meredith. Or Aunt Judith. You have to tell them I love them.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell them,\" Stefan said.\\n\\n \"You can tell them yourself,\" panted another voice, hoarse and unused sounding.\\n\\n Damon had pulled himself across the floor behind Stefan. His face was ravaged, streaked with blood, but his dark eyes burned at her. \"Use your will, Elena. Hold on. You have the strength-\"\\n\\n She smiled at him, waveringly. She knew the truth. What was happening was only finishing what had been started two weeks ago. She\u0027d had thirteen days to get things straight, to make amends with Matt and say good-bye to Margaret. To tell Stefan she loved him. But now the grace period was up.\\n\\n Still, there was no point in hurting Damon. She loved Damon, too. \"I\u0027ll try,\" she promised.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll take you home,\" he said.\\n\\n \"But not yet,\" she told him gently. \"Let\u0027s wait just a little while.\" Something happened in the fathomless black eyes, and the burning spark went out. Then she saw that Damon knew, too.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not afraid,\" she said. \"Well-only a little.\" A drowsiness had started, and she felt very comfortable, but as if she were falling asleep. Things were drifting away from her.\\n\\n An ache rose in her chest. She was not much afraid, but she was sorry. There\\n\\n were so many things she would miss, so many things she wished she had done.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" she said softly. \"How funny.\"\\n\\n underground room. Only this was a doorway into a different light.\\n\\n \"How beautiful,\" she murmured. \"Stefan? I\u0027m so tired.\"\\n\\n \"You can rest now,\" he whispered.\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t let go of me?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Then I won\u0027t be afraid.\"\\n\\n Something was shining on Damon\u0027s face. She reached toward it, touched it, and lifted her fingers away in wonder.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be sad,\" she told him, feeling the cool wetness on her fingertips. But a pang of worry disturbed her. Who was there to understand Damon now? Who would be there to push him, to try to see what was really inside him? \"You have to take care of each other,\" she said, realizing it. A little strength came back to her, like a candle flaring in the wind. \"Stefan, will you promise? Promise to take care of each other?\"\\n\\n \"I promise,\" he said. \"Oh, Elena...\"\\n\\n Waves of sleepiness were overcoming her. \"That\u0027s good,\" she said. \"That\u0027s good, Stefan.\"\\n\\n The doorway was closer, so close she could touch it now. She wondered if her parents were somewhere behind it.\\n\\n \"Time to go home,\" she whispered.\\n\\n And then the darkness and the shadows faded and there was nothing but light. Stefan held her while her eyes closed. And then he just held her, the tears he\u0027d been keeping back falling without restraint. It was a different pain than when he\u0027d pulled her out of the river. There was no anger in this, and no hatred, but a love that seemed to go on and on forever.\\n\\n It hurt even more.\\n\\n He looked at the rectangle of sunlight, just a step or two away from him. Elena had gone into the light. She\u0027d left him here alone.\\n\\n Not for long, he thought.\\n\\n His ring was on the floor. He didn\u0027t even glance at it as he rose, his eyes on the shaft of sunlight shining down.\\n\\n A hand grabbed his arm and pulled him back.\\n\\n Stefan looked into his brother\u0027s face.\\n\\n Damon\u0027s eyes were dark as midnight, and he was holding Stefan\u0027s ring. As Stefan watched, unable to move, he forced the ring onto Stefan\u0027s finger and released him.\\n\\n yours, too. Take it. Take it and go.\" He turned his face away.\\n\\n Stefan gazed at the golden circlet in his palm for a long time.\\n\\n Then his fingers closed over it and he looked back at Damon. His brother\u0027s eyes were shut, his breathing labored. He looked exhausted and in pain.\\n\\n And Stefan had made a promise to Elena.\\n\\n \"Come on,\" he said quietly, putting the ring in his pocket. \"Let\u0027s get you some place where you can rest.\"\\n\\n He put an arm around his brother to help him up. And then, for a moment, he just held on. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-fury-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-15.html","bookId":2033,"book":{"id":2033,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Fury (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: This book begins with the newly \"turned\" Elena watching Damon and Stefan engaged in a fight to the death.
