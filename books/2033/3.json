{"id":108756,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Elena and Damon were waiting in the darkroom. Stefan could sense their presence in the small annex as he pushed the door to the photography room open and led Matt inside. \"These doors are supposed to be locked,\" Matt said as Stefan flipped on the light switch. \"They were,\" said Stefan. He didn\u0027t know what else to say to prepare Matt for what was coming. He\u0027d never deliberately revealed himself to a human before. He stood, quietly, until Matt turned and looked at him. The classroom was cold and silent, and the air seemed to hang heavily. As the moment stretched out, he saw Matt\u0027s expression slowly change from grief-numbed bewilderment to uneasiness. \"I don\u0027t understand,\" Matt said. \"I know you don\u0027t.\" He went on looking at Matt, purposefully dropping the barriers that concealed his Powers from human perception. He saw the reaction in Matt\u0027s face as uneasiness coalesced into fear. Matt blinked and shook his head, his breath coming quicker. \"What-?\" he began, his voice gravelly. \"There are probably a lot of things you\u0027ve wondered about me,\" Stefan said. \"Why I wear sunglasses in strong light. Why I don\u0027t eat. Why my reflexes are so fast.\" Matt had his back to the darkroom now. His throat jerked as if he were trying to swallow. Stefan, with his predator\u0027s senses, could hear Matt\u0027s heart thudding dully. \"No,\" Matt said. \"You must have wondered, must have asked yourself what makes me so different from everybody else.\" \"No. I mean-I don\u0027t care. I keep out of things that aren\u0027t my business.\" Matt was edging toward the door, his eyes darting toward it in a barely perceptible movement. \"Don\u0027t, Matt. I don\u0027t want to hurt you, but I can\u0027t let you leave now.\" He could feel barely leashed need emanating from Elena in her concealment. Wait, he told her. Matt went still, giving up any attempt to move away. \"If you want to scare me, you have,\" he said in a low voice. \"What else do you want?\" Now, Stefan told Elena. He said to Matt, \"Turn around.\" Matt turned. And stifled a cry. Elena stood there, but not the Elena of that afternoon, when Matt had last seen her. Now her feet were bare beneath the hem of her long dress. The thin folds of white muslin that clung to her were caked with ice crystals that sparkled in the light. Her skin, always fair, had a strange wintry luster to it, and her pale gold hair seemed overlaid with a silvery sheen. But the real difference was in her face. Those deep blue eyes were heavy-lidded, almost sleepy looking, and yet unnaturally awake. And a look of sensual anticipation and hunger curled about her lips. She was more beautiful than she had been in life, but it was a frightening beauty. overlaid with a silvery sheen. But the real difference was in her face. Those deep blue eyes were heavy-lidded, almost sleepy looking, and yet unnaturally awake. And a look of sensual anticipation and hunger curled about her lips. She was more beautiful than she had been in life, but it was a frightening beauty. \"Matt,\" she said, lingering over the first consonant of the name. Then she smiled. Stefan heard Matt\u0027s indrawn breath of disbelief, and the near sob he gave as he finally backed away from her. It\u0027s all right, he said, sending the thought to Matt on a surge of Power. As Matt jerked toward him, eyes wide with shock, he added, \"So now you know.\" Matt\u0027s expression said that he didn\u0027t want to know, and Stefan could see the denial in his face. But Damon stepped out beside Elena and moved a little to the right, adding his presence to the charged atmosphere of the room. Matt was surrounded. The three of them closed in on him, inhumanly beautiful, innately menacing. Stefan could smell Matt\u0027s fear. It was the helpless fear of the rabbit for the fox, the mouse for the owl. And Matt was right to be afraid. They were the hunting species; he was the hunted. Their job in life was to kill him. And just now instincts were getting out of control. Matt\u0027s instinct was to panic and run, and it was triggering reflexes in Stefan\u0027s head. When the prey ran, the predator gave chase; it was as simple as that. All three of the predators here were keyed up, on edge, and Stefan felt he couldn\u0027t be responsible for the consequences if Matt bolted. We don\u0027t want to harm you, he told Matt. It\u0027s Elena who needs you, and what she needs won\u0027t leave you permanently damaged. It doesn\u0027t even have to hurt, Matt. But Matt\u0027s muscles were still tensed to flee, and Stefan realized that the three of them were stalking him, moving closer, ready to cut off any escape. You said you would do anything for Elena, he reminded Matt desperately and saw him make his choice. Matt released his breath, the tension draining from his body. \"You\u0027re right; I did,\" he whispered. He visibly braced himself before he continued. \"What does she need?\" Elena leaned forward and put a finger on Matt\u0027s neck, tracing the yielding ridge of an artery. \"Not that one,\" Stefan said quickly. \"You don\u0027t want to kill him. Tell her, Damon.\" He added, when Damon made no effort to do so, Tell her. \"Try here, or here.\" Damon pointed with clinical efficiency, holding Matt\u0027s chin up. He was strong enough that Matt couldn\u0027t break the grip, and Stefan felt Matt\u0027s panic surge up again. Trust me, Matt. He moved in behind the human boy. But it has to be your choice, he finished, suddenly washed with compassion. You can change your mind. he finished, suddenly washed with compassion. You can change your mind. \"Matt,\" she whispered, her heavy-lashed jewel blue eyes fixed on his. Then they trailed down to his throat and her lips parted hungrily. There was no sign of the uncertainty she\u0027d shown when Damon suggested feeding off the paramedics. \"Matt.\" She smiled again, and then she struck, swift as a hunting bird. Stefan put a flattened hand against Matt\u0027s back to give him support. For a moment, as Elena\u0027s teeth pierced his skin, Matt tried to recoil, but Stefan thought swiftly, Don\u0027t fight it; that\u0027s what causes the pain. As Matt tried to relax, unexpected help came from Elena, who was radiating the warm happy thoughts of a wolf cub being fed. She had gotten the biting technique right on the first try this time, and she was filled with innocent pride and growing satisfaction as the sharp pangs of hunger eased. And with appreciation for Matt, Stefan realized, with a sudden shock of jealousy. She didn\u0027t hate Matt or want to kill him, because he posed no threat to Damon. She was fond of Matt. Stefan let her take as much as was safe and then intervened. That\u0027s enough, Elena. You don\u0027t want to injure him. But it took the combined efforts of him, Damon, and a rather groggy Matt to pry her off. \"She needs to rest now,\" Damon said. \"I\u0027m taking her someplace where she can do it safely.\" He wasn\u0027t asking Stefan; he was telling him. As they left, his mental voice added, for Stefan\u0027s ears alone, I haven\u0027t forgotten the way you attacked me, brother. We\u0027ll talk about that later. Stefan stared after them. He\u0027d noted how Elena\u0027s eyes remained locked on Damon, how she followed him without question. But she was out of danger now; Matt\u0027s blood had given her the strength she needed. That was all Stefan had to hang on to, and he told himself it was all that mattered. He turned to take in Matt\u0027s dazed expression. The human boy had sunk into one of the plastic chairs and was gazing straight ahead. Then his eyes lifted to Stefan\u0027s, and they regarded each other grimly. \"So,\" Matt said. \"Now I know.\" He shook his head, turning away slightly. \"But I still can\u0027t believe it,\" he muttered. His fingers pressed gingerly at the side of his neck, and he winced. \"Except for this.\" Then he frowned. \"That guy-Damon. Who is he?\" \"My older brother,\" Stefan said without emotion. \"How do you know his name?\" \"He was at Elena\u0027s house last week. The kitten spat at him.\" Matt paused, clearly remembering something else. \"And Bonnie had some kind of psychic fit.\" \"She had a precognition? What did she say? \"She said-she said that Death was in the house.\" Stefan looked at the door Damon and Elena had passed through. \"She was right.\" Stefan looked at the door Damon and Elena had passed through. \"She was right.\" \"Be like what?\" Stefan said brutally. \"Disoriented? A vampire?\" Matt looked away. \"Both.\" \"As for the first, she may become more rational now that she\u0027s fed. That\u0027s what Damon thinks anyway. As for the other, there\u0027s only one thing you can do to change her condition.\" As Matt\u0027s eyes lit with hope, Stefan continued. \"You can get a wooden stake and hammer it through her heart. Then she won\u0027t be a vampire anymore. She\u0027ll just be dead.\" Matt got up and went to the window. \"You wouldn\u0027t be killing her, though, because that\u0027s already been done. She drowned in the river, Matt. But because she\u0027d had enough blood from me\"-he paused to steady his voice-\"and, it seems, from my brother, she changed instead of simply dying. She woke up a hunter, like us. That\u0027s what she\u0027ll be from now on.\" With his back still turned, Matt answered. \"I always knew there was something about you. I told myself it was just because you were from another country.\" He shook his head again self-deprecatingly. \"But deep down I knew it was more than that. And something still kept telling me I could trust you, and I did.\" \"Like when you went with me to get the vervain.\" \"Yeah. Like that.\" He added, \"Can you tell me what the hell it was for, now?\" \"For Elena\u0027s protection. I wanted to keep Damon away from her. But it looks as if that\u0027s not what she wanted after all.\" He couldn\u0027t help the bitterness, the raw betrayal, in his voice. Matt turned. \"Don\u0027t judge her before you know all the facts, Stefan. That\u0027s one thing I\u0027ve learned.\" Stefan was startled; then, he gave a small humorless smile. As Elena\u0027s exes, he and Matt were in the same position now. He wondered if he would be as gracious about it as Matt had been. Take his defeat like a gentleman. He didn\u0027t think so. Outside, a noise had begun. It was inaudible to human ears, and Stefan almost ignored it-until the words penetrated his consciousness. Then he remembered what he had done in this very school only a few hours ago. Until that moment, he\u0027d forgotten all about Tyler Smallwood and his tough friends. Now that memory had returned; shame and horror closed his throat. He\u0027d been out of his mind with grief over Elena, and his reason had snapped under the pressure. But that was no excuse for what he had done. Were they all dead? Had he, who had sworn so long ago never to kill, killed six people today? \"Stefan, wait. Where are you going?\" When he didn\u0027t answer, Matt followed him, half running to keep up, out of the main school building and onto the blacktop. On the far side of the field, Mr. Shelby stood by the Quonset hut. \"Stefan, wait. Where are you going?\" When he didn\u0027t answer, Matt followed him, half running to keep up, out of the main school building and onto the blacktop. On the far side of the field, Mr. Shelby stood by the Quonset hut. It looked like the Mad Slasher room from the Haunted House fundraiser. Except that this was no tableau set up for visitors. This was real. Bodies were sprawled everywhere, amid shards of wood and glass from the shattered window. Every visible surface was spattered with blood, red-brown and sinister as it dried. And one look at the bodies revealed why: each one had a pair of livid purple wounds in the neck. Except Caroline\u0027s: her neck was unmarked, but her eyes were blank and staring. Behind Stefan, Matt was hyperventilating. \"Stefan, Elena didn\u0027t-she didn\u0027t-\" \"Be quiet,\" Stefan answered tersely. He glanced back at Mr. Shelby, but the janitor had stumbled over to his cart of brooms and mops and was leaning against it. Glass grated under Stefan\u0027s feet as he crossed the floor to kneel by Tyler. Not dead. Relief exploded over Stefan at the realization. Tyler\u0027s chest moved feebly, and when Stefan lifted the boy\u0027s head his eyes opened a slit, glazed and unfocused. You don\u0027t remember anything, Stefan told him mentally. Even as he did it, he wondered why he was bothering. He should just leave Fell\u0027s Church, cut out now and never come back. But he wouldn\u0027t. Not as long as Elena was here. He gathered the unconscious minds of the other victims into his mental grasp and told them the same thing, feeding it deep into their brains. You don\u0027t remember who attacked you. The whole afternoon is a blank. As he did, he felt his mental Powers tremble like overfatigued muscles. He was close to burnout. Outside, Mr. Shelby had found his voice at last and was shouting. Wearily, Stefan let Tyler\u0027s head slip back through his fingers to the floor and turned around. Matt\u0027s lips were peeled back, his nostrils flared, as if he had just smelled something disgusting. His eyes were the eyes of a stranger. \"Elena didn\u0027t,\" he whispered. \"You did.\" Be quiet! Stefan pushed past him into the thankful coolness of the night, putting distance between him and that room, feeling the icy air on his hot skin. Running footsteps from the vicinity of the cafeteria told him that some humans had heard the janitor\u0027s cries at last. \"You did it, didn\u0027t you?\" Matt had followed Stefan out to the field. His voice said he was trying to understand. Stefan rounded on him. \"Yes, I did it,\" he snarled. He stared Matt down, concealing none of the angry menace in his face. \"I told you, Matt, we\u0027re hunters. Killers. You\u0027re the sheep; we\u0027re the wolves. And Tyler has been asking for it every day since I came here.\" Stefan rounded on him. \"Yes, I did it,\" he snarled. He stared Matt down, concealing none of the angry menace in his face. \"I told you, Matt, we\u0027re hunters. Killers. You\u0027re the sheep; we\u0027re the wolves. And Tyler has been asking for it every day since I came here.\" \"Why should I?\" said Stefan coldly, emptily. \"Do you regret it when you eat too much steak? Feel sorry for the cow?\" He saw Matt\u0027s look of sick disbelief and pressed on, driving the pain in his chest deeper. It was better that Matt stay away from him from now on, far away. Or Matt might end up like those bodies in the Quonset hut. \"I am what I am, Matt. And if you can\u0027t handle it, you\u0027d better steer clear of me.\" Matt stared at him a moment longer, the sick disbelief transforming slowly into sick disillusionment. The muscles around his jaw stood out. Then, without a word, he turned on his heel and walked away. Elena was in the graveyard. Damon had left her there, exhorting her to stay until he came back. She didn\u0027t want to sit still, though. She felt tired but not really sleepy, and the new blood was affecting her like a jolt of caffeine. She wanted to go exploring. The graveyard was full of activity although there wasn\u0027t a human in sight. A fox slunk through the shadows toward the river path. Small rodents tunneled under the long lank grass around the headstones, squeaking and scurrying. A barn owl flew almost silently toward the ruined church, where it alighted on the belfry with an eerie cry. Elena got up and followed it. This was much better than hiding in the grass like a mouse or vole. She looked around the ruined church interestedly, using her sharpened senses to examine it. Most of the roof had fallen in, and only three walls were standing, but the belfry stood up like a lonely monument in the rubble. At one side was the tomb of Thomas and Honoria Fell, like a large stone box or coffin. Elena gazed earnestly down into the white marble faces of their statues on the lid. They lay in tranquil repose, their eyes shut, their hands folded on their breasts. Thomas Fell looked serious and a little stern, but Honoria looked merely sad. Elena thought absently of her own parents, lying side by side down in the modern cemetery. I\u0027ll go home; that\u0027s where I\u0027ll go, she thought. She had just remembered about home. She could picture it now: her pretty bedroom with blue curtains and cherrywood furniture and her little fireplace. And something important under the floorboards in the closet. She found her way to Maple Street by instincts that ran deeper than memory, letting her feet guide her there. It was an old, old house, with a big front porch and floor-to-ceiling windows in front. Robert\u0027s car was parked in the driveway. letting her feet guide her there. It was an old, old house, with a big front porch and floor-to-ceiling windows in front. Robert\u0027s car was parked in the driveway. But she wasn\u0027t going to be able to get in here without being noticed. A woman was sitting on the bed with Elena\u0027s red silk kimono in her lap, staring down at it. Aunt Judith. Robert was standing by the dresser, talking to her. Elena found that she could pick up the murmur of his voice even through the glass. \"... out again tomorrow,\" he was saying. \"As long as it doesn\u0027t storm. They\u0027ll go over every inch of those woods, and they\u0027ll find her, Judith. You\u0027ll see.\" Aunt Judith said nothing, and he went on, sounding more desperate. \"We can\u0027t give up hope, no matter what the girls say-\" \"It\u0027s no good, Bob.\" Aunt Judith had raised her head at last, and her eyes were red-rimmed but dry. \"It\u0027s no use.\" \"The rescue effort? I won\u0027t have you talking that way.\" He came over to stand beside her. \"No, not just that... although I know, in my heart, that we\u0027re not going to find her alive. I mean... everything. Us. What happened today is our fault-\" \"That\u0027s not true. It was a freak accident.\" \"Yes, but we made it happen. If we hadn\u0027t been so harsh with her, she would never have driven off alone and been caught in the storm. No, Bob, don\u0027t try to shut me up; I want you to listen.\" Aunt Judith took a deep breath and continued. \"It wasn\u0027t just today, either. Elena\u0027s been having problems for a long time, ever since school started, and somehow I\u0027ve let the signs slip right past me. Because I\u0027ve been too involved with myself-with us-to pay attention to them. I can see that now. And now that Elena\u0027s... gone... I don\u0027t want the same thing to happen with Margaret.\" \"What are you saying?\" \"I\u0027m saying that I can\u0027t marry you, not as soon as we planned. Maybe not ever.\" Without looking at him, she spoke softly. \"Margaret has lost too much already. I don\u0027t want her to feel she\u0027s losing me, too.\" \"She won\u0027t be losing you. If anything, she\u0027ll be gaining someone, because I\u0027ll be here more often. You know how I feel about her.\" \"I\u0027m sorry, Bob; I just don\u0027t see it that way.\" \"You can\u0027t be serious. After all the time I\u0027ve spent here-after all I\u0027ve done...\" Aunt Judith\u0027s voice was drained and implacable. \"I am serious.\" From her perch outside the window, Elena eyed Robert curiously. A vein throbbed in his forehead, and his face had flushed red. \"No, I won\u0027t.\" \"You don\u0027t mean it-\" \"I do mean it. Don\u0027t tell me that I\u0027m going to change my mind, because I\u0027m not.\" For an instant, Robert looked around in helpless frustration; then, his expression darkened. When he spoke, his voice was flat and cold. \"I see. Well, if that\u0027s your final answer, I\u0027d better leave right now.\" \"Bob.\" Aunt Judith turned, startled, but he was already outside the door. She stood up, wavering, as if she were unsure whether or not to go after him. Her fingers kneaded at the red material she was holding. \"Bob!\" she called again, more urgently, and she turned to drop the kimono on Elena\u0027s bed before following him. But as she turned she gasped, a hand flying to her mouth. Her whole body stiffened. Her eyes stared into Elena\u0027s through the silvery pane of glass. For a long moment, they stared at each other that way, neither moving. Then Aunt Judith\u0027s hand came away from her mouth, and she began to shriek.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-fury-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-3.html","bookId":2033,"book":{"id":2033,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Fury (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: This book begins with the newly \"turned\" Elena watching Damon and Stefan engaged in a fight to the death.
