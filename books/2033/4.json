{"id":108757,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Something yanked Elena out of the tree and, yowling a protest, she fell and landed on her feet like a cat. Her knees hit the ground a second later and got bruised. She reared back, fingers hooked into claws to attack whoever had done it. Damon slapped her hand away. \"Why did you grab me?\" she demanded. \"Why didn\u0027t you stay where I put you?\" he snapped. They glared at each other, equally furious. Then Elena was distracted. The shrieking was still going on upstairs, augmented now by rattling and banging at the window. Damon nudged her against the house, where they couldn\u0027t be seen from above. \"Let\u0027s get away from this noise,\" he said fastidiously, looking up. Without waiting for a response, he caught her arm. Elena resisted. \"I have to go in there!\" \"You can\u0027t.\" He gave her a wolfish smile. \"I mean that literally. You can\u0027t go in that house. You haven\u0027t been invited.\" Momentarily nonplussed, Elena let him tow her a few steps. Then she dug her heels in again. \"But I need my diary!\" \"What?\" \"It\u0027s in the closet, under the floorboards. And I need it. I can\u0027t go to sleep without my diary.\" Elena didn\u0027t know why she was making such a fuss, but it seemed important. Damon looked exasperated; then, his face cleared. \"Here,\" he said calmly, eyes glinting. He withdrew something from his jacket. \"Take it.\" Elena eyed his offering doubtfully. \"It\u0027s your diary, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes, but it\u0027s my old one. I want my new one.\" \"This one will have to do, because this one is all you\u0027re getting. Come on before they wake up the whole neighborhood.\" His voice had turned cold and commanding again. Elena considered the book he held. It was small, with a blue velvet cover and a brass lock. Not the newest edition perhaps, but it was familiar to her. She decided it was acceptable. She let Damon lead her out into the night. She didn\u0027t ask where they were going. She didn\u0027t much care. But she recognized the house on Magnolia Avenue; it was where Alaric Saltzman was staying. Elena licked her lips. \"No,\" Damon said shortly. \"This one\u0027s not for biting. There\u0027s something fishy about him, but you should be safe enough in the house. I\u0027ve slept here before. Up here.\" He led her up a flight of stairs to an attic with one small window. It was crowded with stored objects: sleds, skis, a hammock. At the far end, an old mattress lay on the floor. \"He won\u0027t even know you\u0027re here in the morning. Lie down.\" Elena obeyed, assuming a position that seemed natural to her. She lay on her back, hands folded over the diary that she held to her breast. Damon dropped a piece of oilcloth over her, covering her bare feet. \"Go to sleep, Elena,\" he said. He bent over her, and for a moment she thought he was going to... do something. Her thoughts were too muddled. But his night black eyes filled her vision. Then he pulled back, and she could breathe again. The gloom of the attic settled in on her. Her eyes drifted shut and she slept. She woke slowly, assembling information about where she was, piece by piece. Somebody\u0027s attic from the looks of it. What was she doing here? Rats or mice were scuffling somewhere among the piles of oilcloth-draped objects, but the sound didn\u0027t bother her. The faintest trace of pale light showed around the edges of the shuttered window. Elena pushed her makeshift blanket off and got up to investigate. It was definitely someone\u0027s attic, and not that of anyone she knew. She felt as if she had been sick for a long time and had just woken up from her illness. What day is it? she wondered. She could hear voices below her. Downstairs. Something told her to be careful and quiet. She felt afraid of making any kind of disturbance. She eased the attic door open without a sound and cautiously descended to the landing. Looking down, she could see a living room. She recognized it; she\u0027d sat on that ottoman when Alaric Saltzman had given a party. She was in the Ramsey house. And Alaric Saltzman was down there; she could see the top of his sandy head. His voice puzzled her. After a moment she realized it was because he didn\u0027t sound fatuous or inane or any of the ways Alaric usually sounded in class. He wasn\u0027t spouting psycho-babble, either. He was speaking coolly and decisively to two other men. \"She might be anywhere, even right under our noses. More likely outside town, though. Maybe in the woods.\" \"Remember, the first two victims were found near the woods,\" said the other man. Is that Dr. Feinberg? Elena thought. What\u0027s he doing here? What am I doing here? \"No, it\u0027s more than that,\" Alaric was saying. The other men were listening to him with respect, even with deference. \"The woods are tied up in this. They may have a hiding place out there, a lair where they can go to earth if they\u0027re discovered. If there is one, I\u0027ll find it.\" \"Are you sure?\" said Dr. Feinberg. \"I\u0027m sure,\" Alaric said briefly. \"And that\u0027s where you think Elena is,\" said the principal. \"But will she stay there? Or will she come back into town?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" Alaric paced a few steps and picked up a book from the coffee table, running his thumbs over it absently. \"One way to find out is to watch her friends. Bonnie McCullough and that dark-haired girl, Meredith. Chances are they\u0027ll be the first ones to see her. That\u0027s how it usually happens.\" \"And once we do track her down?\" Dr. Feinberg asked. \"Leave that to me,\" Alaric said quietly and grimly. He shut the book and dropped it on the coffee table with a disturbingly conclusive sound. The principal glanced at his watch. \"I\u0027d better get moving; the service starts at ten o\u0027clock. I presume you\u0027ll both be there?\" He paused on his way to the door and looked back, his manner irresolute. \"Alaric, I hope you can take care of this. When I called you in, things hadn\u0027t gone this far. Now I\u0027m beginning to wonder-\" \"I can take care of it, Brian. I told you; leave it to me. Would you rather have Robert E. Lee in all the papers, not just as the scene of a tragedy but also as \u0027The Haunted High School of Boone County\u0027? A gathering place for ghouls? The school where the undead walk? Is that the kind of publicity you want?\" Mr. Newcastle hesitated, chewing his lip, then nodded, still looking unhappy. \"All right, Alaric. But make it quick and clean. I\u0027ll see you at the church.\" He left and Dr. Fein-berg followed him. Alaric stood there for some time, apparently staring into space. At last he nodded once and went out the front door himself. Elena slowly trailed back up the stairs. Now what had all that been about? She felt confused, as if she were floating loose in time and space. She needed to know what day it was, why she was here, and why she felt so frightened. Why she felt so intensely that no one must see her or hear her or notice her at all. Looking around the attic, she saw nothing that would give her any help. Where she had been lying there were only the mattress and the oilcloth-and a little blue book. When she finished, she was weak with fear and horror. Bright spots danced and shimmered before her eyes. There was so much pain in these pages. So many schemes, so many secrets, so much need. It was the story of a girl who\u0027d felt lost in her own hometown, in her own family. Who\u0027d been looking for... something, something she could never quite reach. But that wasn\u0027t what caused this throbbing panic in her chest that drained all the energy from her body. That wasn\u0027t why she felt as if she were falling even when she sat as still as she could get. What caused the panic was that she remembered. She remembered everything now. The bridge, the rushing water. The terror as the air left her lungs and there was nothing but liquid to breathe. The way it had hurt. And the final instant when it had stopped hurting, when everything had stopped. When everything... stopped. Oh, Stefan, I was so frightened, she thought. And the same fear was inside her now. In the woods, how could she have behaved like that to Stefan? How could she have forgotten him, everything he meant to her? What had made her act that way? But she knew. At the center of her consciousness, she knew. Nobody got up and walked away from a drowning like that. Nobody got up and walked away alive. Slowly, she rose and went to look at the shuttered window. The darkened pane of glass acted as a mirror, throwing her reflection back at her. It was not the reflection she\u0027d seen in her dream, where she had run down a hall of mirrors that seemed to have a life of their own. There was nothing sly or cruel about this face. Just the same, it was subtly different from what she was used to seeing. There was a pale glow to her skin and a telling hollowness about the eyes. Elena touched fingertips to her neck, on either side. This was where Stefan and Damon had each taken her blood. Had it really been enough times, and had she really taken enough of theirs in return? It must have been. And now, for the rest of her life, for the rest of her existence, she would have to feed as Stefan did. She would have to... She sank to her knees, pressing her forehead against the bare wood of a wall. I can\u0027t, she thought. Oh, please, I can\u0027t; I can\u0027t. She had never been very religious. But from that deep place inside, her terror was welling up, and every particle of her being joined in the cry for aid. Oh, please, she thought. Oh, please, please, help me. She didn\u0027t ask for anything specific; she couldn\u0027t gather her thoughts that far. Only: Oh, please help me, oh please, please. Her face was still pale but eerily beautiful, like fine porcelain lit from within. Her eyes were still smudged with shadows. But there was a resolve in them. She had to find Stefan. If there was any help for her, he would know of it. And if there wasn\u0027t... well, she needed him all the more. There was nowhere else she wanted to be except with him. She shut the door of the attic carefully behind her as she went out. Alaric Saltzman mustn\u0027t discover her hiding place. On the wall, she saw a calendar with the days up to December 4 crossed off. Four days since last Saturday night. She\u0027d slept for four days. When she reached the front door, she cringed from the daylight outside. It hurt. Even though the sky was so overcast that rain or snow looked imminent, it hurt her eyes. She had to force herself to leave the safety of the house, and then she felt a gnawing paranoia about being out in the open. She slunk along beside fences, staying close to trees, ready to melt into the shadows. She felt like a shadow herself -or a ghost, in Honoria Fell\u0027s long white gown. She would frighten the wits out of anyone who saw her. But all her circumspection seemed to be wasted. There was no one on the streets to see her; the town might have been abandoned. She went by seemingly deserted houses, forsaken yards, closed stores. Presently she saw parked cars lining the street, but they were empty, too. And then she saw a shape against the sky that stopped her in her tracks. A steeple, white against the thick dark clouds. Elena\u0027s legs trembled as she made herself creep closer to the building. She\u0027d known this church all her life; she\u0027d seen the cross inscribed on that wall a thousand times. But now she edged toward it as if it were a caged animal that might break loose and bite her. She pressed one hand to the stone wall and slid it nearer and nearer to the carved symbol. When her outspread fingers touched the arm of the cross, her eyes filled and her throat ached. She let her hand glide along it until it gently covered the engraving. Then she leaned against the wall and let the tears come. I\u0027m not evil, she thought. I did things I shouldn\u0027t have. I thought about myself too much; I never thanked Matt and Bonnie and Meredith for all they did for me. I should have played more with Margaret and been nicer to Aunt Judith. But I\u0027m not evil. I\u0027m not damned. When she could see again, she looked up at the building. Mr. Newcastle had said something about the church. Was it this one he meant? She avoided the front of the church and the main doorway. There was a side door that led to the choir loft, and she slipped up the stairs noiselessly and looked down from the gallery. She saw at once why the streets had been so empty. It seemed as if everyone in Fell\u0027s Church was here, every seat in every pew filled, and the back of the church packed solid with people standing. Staring at the front rows, Elena realized that she recognized every face; they were members of the senior class, and neighbors, and friends of Aunt Judith. Aunt Judith was there, too, wearing the black dress she\u0027d worn to Elena\u0027s parents\u0027 funeral. Fell\u0027s Church was here, every seat in every pew filled, and the back of the church packed solid with people standing. Staring at the front rows, Elena realized that she recognized every face; they were members of the senior class, and neighbors, and friends of Aunt Judith. Aunt Judith was there, too, wearing the black dress she\u0027d worn to Elena\u0027s parents\u0027 funeral. \"... share our remembrances of this very special girl,\" he said, and he moved aside. Elena watched what happened after with the unearthly feeling that she had a loge seat at a play. She was not at all involved in the events down there on stage; she was only a spectator, but it was her life she was watching. Mr. Carson, Sue Carson\u0027s father, came up and talked about her. The Carsons had known her since she was born, and he talked about the days she and Sue had played in their front yard in the summer. He talked about the beautiful and accomplished young lady she had become. He got a frog in his throat and had to stop and take off his glasses. Sue Carson went up. She and Elena hadn\u0027t been close friends since elementary school, but they\u0027d remained on good terms. Sue had been one of the few girls who\u0027d stayed on Elena\u0027s side after Stefan had come under suspicion for Mr. Tanner\u0027s murder. But now Sue was crying as if she\u0027d lost a sister. \"A lot of people weren\u0027t nice to Elena after Halloween,\" she said, wiping her eyes and going on. \"And I know that hurt her. But Elena was strong. She never changed just to conform to what other people thought she should be. And I respected her for that, so much...\" Sue\u0027s voice wobbled. \"When I was up for Homecoming Queen, I wanted to be chosen, but I knew I wouldn\u0027t be and that was all right. Because if Robert E. Lee ever had a queen, it was Elena. And I think she always will be now, because that\u0027s how we\u0027ll all remember her. And I think that for years to come the girls who will go to our school might remember her and think about how she stuck by what she thought was right...\" This time Sue couldn\u0027t steady her voice and the reverend helped her back to her seat. The girls in the senior class, even the ones that had been nastiest and most spiteful, were crying and holding hands. Girls Elena knew for a fact hated her were sniffling. Suddenly she was everybody\u0027s best friend. There were boys crying, too. Shocked, Elena huddled closer to the railing. She couldn\u0027t stop watching, even though it was the most horrible thing she had ever seen. Frances Decatur got up, her plain face plainer than ever with grief. \"She went out of her way to be nice to me,\" she said huskily. \"She let me eat lunch with her.\" Rubbish, Elena thought. I only spoke to you in the first place because you were useful in finding out information about Stefan. But it was the same with each person who went up to the pulpit; no one could find enough words to praise Elena. \"I always admired her...\" \"One of my favorite students...\" When Meredith rose, Elena\u0027s whole body stiffened. She didn\u0027t know if she could deal with this. But the dark-haired girl was one of the few people in the church who wasn\u0027t crying, although her face had a grave, sad look that reminded Elena of Honoria Fell as she looked on her tomb. \"When I think about Elena, I think about the good times we had together,\" she said, speaking quietly and with her customary self-control. \"Elena always had ideas, and she could make the most boring work into fun. I never told her that, and now I wish I had. I wish that I could talk to her one more time, just so she would know. And if Elena could hear me now\"-Meredith looked around the church and drew a long breath, apparently to calm herself-\"if she could hear me now, I would tell her how much those good times meant to me, and how much I wish that we could still have them. Like the Thursday nights we used to sit together in her room, practicing for the debate team. I wish we could do that just once more like we used to.\" Meredith took another long breath and shook her head. \"But I know we can\u0027t, and that hurts.\" What are you talking about? Elena thought, her misery interrupted by bewilderment. We used to practice for the debate team on Wednesday nights, not Thursdays. And it wasn\u0027t in my bedroom; it was in yours. And it was no fun at all; in fact, we ended up quitting because we both hated it... Suddenly, watching Meredith\u0027s carefully composed face, so calm on the outside to conceal the tension within, Elena felt her heart begin to pound. Meredith was sending a message, a message only Elena could be expected to understand. Which meant that Meredith expected Elena to be able to hear it. Meredith knew. Had Stefan told her? Elena scanned the rows of mourners below, realizing for the first time that Stefan wasn\u0027t among them. Neither was Matt. No, it didn\u0027t seem likely that Stefan would have told Meredith, or that Meredith would choose this way of getting a message to her if he had. Then Elena remembered the way Meredith had looked at her the night they had rescued Stefan from the well, when Elena had asked to be left alone with Stefan. She remembered those keen dark eyes studying her face more than once in the last months, and the way Meredith had seemed to grow quieter and more thoughtful each time Elena came up with some odd request. Meredith had guessed then. Elena wondered just how much of the truth she\u0027d put together. Bonnie was coming up now, crying in earnest. That was surprising; if Meredith knew, why hadn\u0027t she told Bonnie? But maybe Meredith had only a suspicion, something she didn\u0027t want to share with Bonnie in case it turned out to be a false hope. \"Thank you,\" Bonnie said, wiping her streaming eyes. She tilted her head back to look at the ceiling, either to regain her poise or to get inspiration. As she did, Elena saw something that no one else could see: she saw Bonnie\u0027s face drain of color and of expression, not like somebody about to faint, but in a way that was all too familiar. A chill crawled up Elena\u0027s backbone. Not here. Oh, God, of all times and places, not here. But it was already happening. Bonnie\u0027s chin had lowered; she was looking at the congregation again. Except that this time she didn\u0027t seem to see them at all, and the voice that came from Bonnie\u0027s throat was not Bonnie\u0027s voice. \"No one is what they appear. Remember that. No one is what they appear.\" Then she just stood there, unmoving, staring straight ahead with blank eyes. People began to shuffle and look at one another. There was a murmur of worry. \"Remember that-remember-no one is what they seem...\" Bonnie swayed suddenly, and Reverend Bethea ran to her while another man hastened up from the other side. The second man had a bald head that was now shining with sweat-Mr. Newcastle, Elena realized. And there at the back of the church, striding up the nave, was Alaric Saltzman. He reached Bonnie just as she fainted, and Elena heard a step behind her on the stair.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-fury-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-4.html","bookId":2033,"book":{"id":2033,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Fury (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: This book begins with the newly \"turned\" Elena watching Damon and Stefan engaged in a fight to the death.
