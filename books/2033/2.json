You had to make her like us, like you. It wasn\u0027t enough just to kill her.\"\\n\\n Damon didn\u0027t glance back at him. He was looking at Elena intently through those hooded eyes, still kneeling there holding her chin. \"That\u0027s the third time you\u0027ve said that, and I\u0027m getting a little tired of it,\" he commented softly. Disheveled, still slightly out of breath, he was yet self-composed, in control. \"Elena, did I kill you?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not,\" Elena said, winding her fingers in those of his free hand. She was getting impatient. What were they talking about anyway? Nobody had been killed.\\n\\n \"I never thought you were a liar,\" Stefan said to Damon, the bitterness in his voice unchanged. \"Just about everything else, but not that. I\u0027ve never heard you try to cover up for yourself before.\"\\n\\n \"In another minute,\" said Damon, \"I\u0027m going to lose my temper.\"\\n\\n What more can you possibly do to me? Stefan returned. Killing me would be a mercy.\\n\\n \"I ran out of mercy for you a century ago,\" Damon said aloud. He let go, finally, of Elena\u0027s chin. \"What do you remember about today?\" he asked her.\\n\\n Elena spoke tiredly, like a child reciting a hated lesson. \"Today was the Founders\u0027 Day celebration.\" Flexing her fingers in his, she looked up at Damon. That was as far as she could get on her own, but it wasn\u0027t enough. Nettled, she tried to remember something else.\\n\\n \"There was someone in the cafeteria... Caroline.\" She offered the name to him, pleased. \"She was going to read my diary in front of everyone, and that was bad because...\" Elena fumbled with the memory and lost it. \"I don\u0027t remember why. But we tricked her.\" She smiled at him warmly, conspiratorially.\\n\\n \"Oh, \u0027we\u0027 did, did we?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. You got it away from her. You did it for me.\" The fingers of her free hand crept under his jacket, searching for the square-cornered hardness of the little book. \"Because you love me,\" she said, finding it and scratching at it lightly. \"You do love me, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n There was a faint sound from the center of the clearing. Elena looked and saw that Stefan had turned his face away.\\n\\n \"Elena. What happened next?\" Damon\u0027s voice called her back.\\n\\n \"Next? Next Aunt Judith started arguing with me.\" Elena pondered this a moment and at last shrugged. \"Over... something. I got angry. She\u0027s not my mother. She can\u0027t tell me what to do.\"\\n\\n Damon\u0027s voice was dry. \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s going to be a problem anymore. What next?\"\\n\\n Damon\u0027s voice was dry. \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s going to be a problem anymore. What next?\"\\n\\n \"And where did you go in Matt\u0027s car?\"\\n\\n \"To Wickery Bridge,\" Stefan said, turning back toward them. His eyes were desolate.\\n\\n \"No, to the boardinghouse,\" Elena corrected, irritated. \"To wait for... mm... I forget. Anyway, I waited there. Then... then the storm started. Wind, rain, all that. I didn\u0027t like it. I got in the car. But something came after me.\"\\n\\n \"Someone came after you,\" said Stefan, looking at Damon.\\n\\n \"Some thing,\" Elena insisted. She had had enough of his interruptions. \"Let\u0027s go away somewhere, just us,\" she said to Damon, kneeling up so that her face was close to his.\\n\\n \"In a minute,\" he said. \"What kind of thing came after you?\"\\n\\n She settled back, exasperated. \"I don\u0027t know what kind of thing! It was like nothing I\u0027ve ever seen. Not like you and Stefan. It was...\" Images rippled through her mind. Mist flowing along the ground. The wind shrieking. A shape, white, enormous, looking as if it were made out of mist itself. Gaining on her like a wind-driven cloud.\\n\\n \"Maybe it was just part of the storm,\" she said. \"But I thought it wanted to hurt me. I got away though.\" Fiddling with the zipper to Damon\u0027s leather jacket, she smiled secretly and looked up at him through her lashes.\\n\\n For the first time, Damon\u0027s face showed emotion. His lips twisted in a grimace. \"You got away.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. I remembered what... someone... told me about running water. Evil things can\u0027t cross it. So I drove toward Drowning Creek, toward the bridge. And then...\" She hesitated, frowning, trying to find a solid memory in the new confusion. Water. She remembered water. And someone screaming. But nothing else. \"And then I crossed it,\" she concluded finally, brightly. \"I must have, because here I am. And that\u0027s all. Can we go now?\"\\n\\n Damon didn\u0027t answer her.\\n\\n \"The car\u0027s still in the river,\" said Stefan. He and Damon were looking at each other like two adults having a discussion over the head of an uncomprehending child, their hostilities suspended for the moment. Elena felt a surge of annoyance. She opened her mouth, but Stefan was continuing. \"Bonnie and Meredith and I found it. I went underwater and got her, but by then...\"\\n\\n By then, what? Elena frowned.\\n\\n Damon\u0027s lips were curved mockingly. \"And you gave up on her? You, of all people, should have suspected what might happen. Or was the idea so repugnant to you that you couldn\u0027t even consider it? Would you rather she were really dead?\"\\n\\n people, should have suspected what might happen. Or was the idea so repugnant to you that you couldn\u0027t even consider it? Would you rather she were really dead?\"\\n\\n Elena opened her mouth again, but Damon laid two fingers on it to keep her quiet. He said smoothly, \"And that\u0027s the problem now-or are you too blind to see that, too? You told me to look at her; look at her yourself. She\u0027s in shock, irrational. Oh, yes, even I admit that.\" He paused for a blinding smile before going on. \"It\u0027s more than just the normal confusion after changing. She\u0027ll need blood, human blood, or her body won\u0027t have the strength to finish the change. She\u0027ll die.\"\\n\\n What do you mean irrational? Elena thought indignantly. \"I\u0027m fine,\" she said around Damon\u0027s fingers. \"I\u0027m tired, that\u0027s all. I was going to sleep when I heard you two fighting, and I came to help you. And then you wouldn\u0027t even let me kill him,\" she finished, disgusted.\\n\\n \"Yes, why didn\u0027t you?\" said Stefan. He was staring at Damon as if he could bore holes through him with his eyes. Any trace of cooperation on his part was gone. \"It would have been the easiest thing to do.\"\\n\\n Damon stared back at him, suddenly furious, his own animosity flooding up to meet Stefan\u0027s. He was breathing quickly and lightly. \"Maybe I don\u0027t like things easy,\"\\n\\n he hissed. Then he seemed to regain control of himself once more. His lips curled in mockery, and he added, \"Put it this way, dear brother: if anyone\u0027s going to have the satisfaction of killing you, it will be me. No one else. I plan to take care of the job personally. And it\u0027s something I\u0027m very good at; I promise you.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve shown us that,\" Stefan said quietly, as if each word sickened him.\\n\\n \"But this one,\" Damon said, turning to Elena with glittering eyes, \"I didn\u0027t kill. Why should I? I could have changed her any time I liked.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe because she had just gotten engaged to marry someone else.\"\\n\\n Damon lifted Elena\u0027s hand, still twined with his. On the third finger a gold ring glittered, set with one deep blue stone. Elena frowned at it, vaguely remembering having seen it before. Then she shrugged and leaned against Damon wearily.\\n\\n \"Well, now,\" Damon said, looking down at her, \"that doesn\u0027t seem to be much of a problem, does it? I think she may have been glad to forget you.\" He looked up at Stefan with an unpleasant smile. \"But we\u0027ll find out once she\u0027s herself again. We can ask her then which of us she chooses. Agreed?\"\\n\\n Stefan shook his head. \"How can you even suggest that? After what happened...\" His voice trailed off.\\n\\n \"With Katherine? I can say it, if you can\u0027t. Katherine made a foolish choice, and she paid the price for it. Elena is different; she knows her own mind. But it doesn\u0027t matter if you agree,\" he added, overriding Stefan\u0027s new protests. \"The fact is that she\u0027s weak now, and she needs blood. I\u0027m going to see that she gets it, and then I\u0027m going to find who did this to her. You can come or not. Suit yourself.\"\\n\\n He stood, drawing Elena up with him. Let\u0027s go.\\n\\n She recognized the place where they left the wood. She had been there earlier today. Now, however, there was some sort of frenzied activity going on: red and blue lights flashing on cars, spotlights framing the dark huddled shapes of people. Elena looked at them curiously. Several were familiar. That woman, for instance, with the thin harrowed face and the anxious eyes-Aunt Judith? And the tall man beside her-Aunt Judith\u0027s fianc.., Robert?\\n\\n There should be someone else with them, Elena thought. A child with hair as pale as Elena\u0027s own. But try as she might, she could not conjure up a name.\\n\\n The two girls with their arms around each other, standing in a circle of officials, those two she remembered though. The little red-haired one who was crying was Bonnie. The taller one with the sweep of dark hair, Meredith.\\n\\n \"But she\u0027s not in the water,\" Bonnie was saying to a man in a uniform. Her voice trembled on the edge of hysteria. \"We saw Stefan get her out. I\u0027ve told you and told you.\"\\n\\n \"And you left him here with her?\"\\n\\n \"We had to. The storm was getting worse, and there was something coming-\" \"Never mind that,\" Meredith broke in. She sounded only slightly calmer than Bonnie. \"Stefan said that if he-had to leave her, he\u0027d leave her lying under the willow trees.\"\\n\\n \"And just where is Stefan now?\" another uniformed man asked.\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know. We went back to get help. He probably followed us. But as for what happened to-to Elena...\" Bonnie turned back and buried her face in Meredith\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\n They\u0027re upset about me, Elena realized. How silly of them. I can clear that up, anyway. She started forward into the light, but Damon pulled her back. She looked at him, wounded.\\n\\n \"Not like that. Pick the ones you want, and we\u0027ll draw them out,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Want for what?\"\\n\\n \"For feeding, Elena. You\u0027re a hunter now. Those are your prey.\"\\n\\n Elena pushed her tongue against a canine tooth doubtfully. Nothing out there looked like food to her. Still, because Damon said so, she was inclined to give him the benefit of the doubt. \"Whichever you think,\" she said obligingly.\\n\\n Damon tilted his head back, eyes narrowed, scanning the scene like an expert evaluating a famous painting. \"Well, how about a couple of nice paramedics?\"\\n\\n Damon tilted his head back, eyes narrowed, scanning the scene like an expert evaluating a famous painting. \"Well, how about a couple of nice paramedics?\"\\n\\n Damon barely glanced over his shoulder at Stefan. \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Because there\u0027ve been enough attacks. She may need human blood, but she doesn\u0027t have to hunt for it.\" Stefan\u0027s face was shut and hostile, but there was an air of grim determination about him.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s another way?\" Damon asked ironically.\\n\\n \"You know there is. Find someone who\u0027s willing-or who can be influenced to be willing. Someone who would do it for Elena and who is strong enough to deal with this, mentally.\"\\n\\n \"And I suppose you know where we can find such a paragon of virtue?\"\\n\\n \"Bring her to the school. I\u0027ll meet you there,\" Stefan said, and disappeared.\\n\\n They left the activity still bustling, lights flashing, people milling. As they went, Elena noticed a strange thing. In the middle of the river, illuminated by the spotlights, was an automobile. It was completely submerged except for the front fender, which stuck out of the water.\\n\\n What a stupid place to park a car, she thought, and followed Damon back into the woods.\\n\\n Stefan was beginning to feel again.\\n\\n It hurt. He\u0027d thought he was through with hurting, through with feeling anything. When he\u0027d pulled Elena\u0027s lifeless body out of the dark water, he\u0027d thought that nothing could ever hurt again because nothing could match that moment.\\n\\n He\u0027d been wrong.\\n\\n He stopped and stood with his good hand braced against a tree, head down, breathing deeply. When the red mists cleared and he could see again, he went on, but the burning ache in his chest continued undiminished. Stop thinking about her, he told himself, knowing that it was useless.\\n\\n But she wasn\u0027t truly dead. Didn\u0027t that count for something? He\u0027d thought he would never hear her voice again, never feel her touch...\\n\\n And now, when she touched him, she wanted to kill him.\\n\\n He stopped again, doubling over, afraid he was going to be sick.\\n\\n Seeing her like this was worse torture than seeing her lying cold and dead. Maybe that was why Damon had let him live. Maybe this was Damon\u0027s revenge.\\n\\n And maybe Stefan should just do what he\u0027d planned to do after killing Damon. Wait until dawn and take off the silver ring that protected him from sunlight. Stand bathing in the fiery embrace of those rays until they burned the flesh from his bones\\n\\n and stopped the pain once and for all.\\n\\n Stefan detoured toward the boardinghouse. He needed to clean up before he could let humans see him. In his room, he washed the blood from his face and neck and examined his arm. The healing process had already begun, and with concentration he could accelerate it still further. He was burning up his Powers fast; the fight with his brother had already weakened him. But this was important. Not because of the pain-he scarcely noticed that-but because he needed to be fit.\\n\\n Damon and Elena were waiting outside the school. He could feel his brother\u0027s impatience and Elena\u0027s wild new presence there in the dark.\\n\\n \"This had better work,\" Damon said.\\n\\n Stefan said nothing. The school auditorium was another center of commotion. People ought to have been enjoying the Founders\u0027 Day dance; in fact, those who had remained through the storm were pacing around or gathered in small groups talking. Stefan looked in the open door, searching with his mind for one particular presence. He found it. A blond head was bent over a table in the corner.\\n\\n Matt.\\n\\n Matt straightened and looked around, puzzled. Stefan willed him to come outside. You need some fresh air, he thought, insinuating the suggestion into Matt\u0027s\\n\\n subconscious. You feel like just stepping out for a moment.\\n\\n To Damon, standing invisible just beyond the light, he said, Take her into the school, to the photography room. She knows where it is. Don\u0027t show yourselves until I say. Then he backed away and waited for Matt to appear.\\n\\n Matt came out, his drawn face turned up to the moonless sky. He started violently when Stefan spoke to him.\\n\\n \"Stefan! You\u0027re here!\" Desperation, hope, and horror struggled for dominance on his face. He hurried over to Stefan. \"Did they-bring her back yet? Is there any news?\"\\n\\n \"What have you heard?\"\\n\\n Matt stared at him a moment before answering. \"Bonnie and Meredith came in saying that Elena had gone off of Wickery Bridge in my car. They said that she...\" He paused and swallowed. \"Stefan, it\u0027s not true, is it?\" His eyes were pleading. Stefan looked away.\\n\\n \"Oh, God,\" Matt said hoarsely. He turned his back on Stefan, pressing the heels of his hands into his eyes. \"I don\u0027t believe it; I don\u0027t. It can\u0027t be true.\"\\n\\n \"Matt...\" He touched the other boy\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry.\" Matt\u0027s voice was rough and ragged. \"You must be going through hell, and here I am making it worse.\"\\n\\n His only other option was to tell Matt the truth. Let Matt make his own choice, knowing everything.\\n\\n \"If there were something you could do for Elena right now,\" he said, \"would you do it?\"\\n\\n Matt was too lost in emotion to ask what kind of idiotic question that was.\\n\\n \"Anything,\" he said almost angrily, rubbing a sleeve over his eyes. \"I\u0027d do anything for her.\" He looked at Stefan with something like defiance, his breathing shaky.\\n\\n Congratulations\u0027, Stefan thought, feeling the sudden yawning pit in his stomach. You\u0027ve just won yourself a trip to the Twilight Zone.\\n\\n \"Come with me,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got something to show you.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-fury-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-2.html","bookId":2033,"book":{"id":2033,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Fury (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: This book begins with the newly \"turned\" Elena watching Damon and Stefan engaged in a fight to the death.
