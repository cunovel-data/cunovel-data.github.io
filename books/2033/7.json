But first I want to know what\u0027s been going on in town since I-left.\" \"Well, hysteria mostly,\" Meredith said, raising an eyebrow. \"Your Aunt Judith\u0027s been pretty badly off. She hallucinated that she saw you-only it wasn\u0027t a hallucination, was it? And she and Robert have sort of broken up.\" \"I know,\" Elena said grimly. \"Go on.\" \"Everybody at school is upset. I wanted to talk to Stefan, especially when I began to suspect you weren\u0027t really dead, but he hasn\u0027t been at school. Matt has been, but there\u0027s something wrong with him. He looks like a zombie, and he won\u0027t talk to anyone. I wanted to explain to him that there was a chance you might not be gone forever; I thought that would cheer him up. But he wouldn\u0027t listen. He was acting totally out of character, and at one point I thought he was going to hit me. He wouldn\u0027t listen to a word.\" \"Oh, God-Matt.\" Something terrible was stirring at the bottom of Elena\u0027s mind, some memory too disturbing to be let loose. She couldn\u0027t cope with anything more just now, she couldn\u0027t, she thought, and slam dunked the memory back down. Meredith was going on. \"It\u0027s clear, though, that some other people are suspicious about your \u0027death.\u0027 That\u0027s why I said what I did in the memorial service; I was afraid if I said the real day and place that Alaric Saltzman would end up ambushing you outside the house. He\u0027s been asking all sorts of questions, and it\u0027s a good thing Bonnie didn\u0027t know anything she could blab.\" \"That isn\u0027t fair,\" Bonnie protested. \"Alaric\u0027s just interested, that\u0027s all, and he wants to help us through the trauma, like before. He\u0027s an Aquarius-\" \"He\u0027s a spy,\" said Elena, \"and maybe more than that. But we\u0027ll talk about that later. What about Tyler Smallwood? I didn\u0027t see him at the service.\" Meredith looked nonplussed. \"You mean you don\u0027t know?\" \"I don\u0027t know anything; I\u0027ve been asleep for four days in an attic.\" \"Well...\" Meredith paused uneasily. \"Tyler just got back from the hospital. Same with Dick Carter and those four tough guys they had along with them on Founders\u0027 Day. They were attacked in the Quonset hut that evening and they lost a lot of blood.\" \"Oh.\" The mystery of why Stefan\u0027s Powers had been so much stronger that night was explained. And why they\u0027d been getting weaker ever since. He probably hadn\u0027t eaten since then. \"Meredith, is Stefan a suspect?\" \"Well, Tyler\u0027s father tried to make him one, but the police couldn\u0027t make the times work out. They know approximately when Tyler was attacked because he was supposed to meet Mr. Smallwood, and he didn\u0027t show up. And Bonnie and I can alibi Stefan for that time because we\u0027d just left him by the river with your body. So he couldn\u0027t have gotten back to the Quonset hut to attack Tyler-at least no normal human could. And so far the police aren\u0027t thinking about anything supernatural.\" supposed to meet Mr. Smallwood, and he didn\u0027t show up. And Bonnie and I can alibi Stefan for that time because we\u0027d just left him by the river with your body. So he couldn\u0027t have gotten back to the Quonset hut to attack Tyler-at least no normal human could. And so far the police aren\u0027t thinking about anything supernatural.\" \"Tyler and those guys can\u0027t identify the attacker because they can\u0027t remember a thing about that afternoon,\" Meredith added. \"Neither can Caroline.\" \"Caroline was in there?\" \"Yes, but she wasn\u0027t bitten. Just in shock. In spite of everything she\u0027s done, I almost feel sorry for her.\" Meredith shrugged and added, \"She looks pretty pathetic these days.\" \"And I don\u0027t think anyone will ever suspect Stefan after what happened with those dogs at church today,\" Bonnie put in. \"My dad says that a big dog could have broken the window in the Quonset hut, and the wounds in Tyler\u0027s throat looked sort of like animal wounds. I think a lot of people believe it was a dog or a pack of dogs that did it.\" \"It\u0027s a convenient explanation,\" Meredith said dryly. \"It means they don\u0027t have to think any more about it.\" \"But that\u0027s ridiculous,\" said Elena. \"Normal dogs don\u0027t behave that way. Aren\u0027t people wondering about why their dogs would suddenly go mad and turn on them?\" \"Lots of people are just getting rid of them. Oh, and I heard someone talk about mandatory rabies testing,\" Meredith said. \"But it\u0027s not just rabies, is it, Elena?\" \"No, I don\u0027t think so. And neither do Stefan or Damon. And that\u0027s what I came over to talk to you about.\" Elena explained, as clearly as she could, what she had been thinking about the Other Power in Fell\u0027s Church. She told about the force that had chased her off the bridge and about the feeling she\u0027d had with the dogs and about everything she and Stefan and Damon had discussed. She finished with, \"And Bonnie said it herself in church today: \u0027Something evil.\u0027 I think that\u0027s what\u0027s here in Fell\u0027s Church, something nobody knows about, something completely evil. I don\u0027t suppose you know what you meant by that, Bonnie.\" But Bonnie\u0027s mind was running on another track. \"So Damon didn\u0027t necessarily do all those awful things you said he did,\" she said shrewdly. \"Like killing Yangtze and hurting Vickie and murdering Mr. Tanner, and all. I told you nobody that gorgeous could be a psycho killer.\" \"I think,\" said Meredith with a glance at Elena, \"that you had better forget about Damon as a love interest.\" \"Yes,\" said Elena emphatically. \"He did kill Mr. Tanner, Bonnie. And it stands to reason he did the other attacks, too; I\u0027ll ask him about that. And I\u0027m having enough trouble dealing with him myself. You don\u0027t want to mess with him, Bonnie, believe me.\" \"I\u0027m supposed to leave Damon alone; I\u0027m supposed to leave Alaric alone... Are there any guys I\u0027m not supposed to leave alone? And meanwhile Elena gets them all. It\u0027s not fair.\" \"I don\u0027t know. Something tremendously strong-but it could be shielding itself so that we can\u0027t sense it. It could look like an ordinary person. And that\u0027s why I came for your help, because it could be anybody in Fell\u0027s Church. It\u0027s like what Bonnie said during the service today: \u0027Nobody is what they seem.\u0027 \" Bonnie looked forlorn. \"I don\u0027t remember saying that.\" \"You said it, all right. \u0027Nobody is what they seem,\u0027 \" Elena quoted again weightily. \"Nobody.\" She glanced at Meredith, but the dark eyes under the elegantly arched eyebrows were calm and distant. \"Well, that would seem to make everybody a suspect,\" Meredith said in her most unruffled voice. \"Right?\" \"Right,\" said Elena. \"But we\u0027d better get a note pad and pencil and make a list of the most important ones. Damon and Stefan have already agreed to help investigate, and if you\u0027ll help, too, we\u0027ll stand an even better chance of finding it.\" She was hitting her stride with this; she\u0027d always been good at organizing things, from schemes to get boys to fundraising events. This was just a more serious version of the old plan A and plan B. Meredith gave the pencil and paper to Bonnie, who looked at it. and then at Meredith, and then at Elena. \"Fine,\" she said, \"but who goes on the list?\" \"Well, anyone we have reason to suspect of being the Other Power. Anyone who might have done the things we know it did: seal Stefan in the well, chase me, set those dogs on people. Anyone we\u0027ve noticed behaving oddly.\" \"Matt,\" said Bonnie, writing busily. \"And Vickie. And Robert.\" \"Bonnie!\" exclaimed Elena and Meredith simultaneously. Bonnie looked up. \"Well, Matt has been acting oddly, and so has Vickie, for months now. And Robert was hanging around outside the church before the service, but he never came in-\" \"Oh, Bonnie, honestly,\" Meredith said. \"Vickie\u0027s a victim, not a suspect. And if Matt\u0027s an evil Power, I\u0027m the hunchback of Notre Dame. And as for Robert-\" \"Fine, I\u0027ve crossed it all out,\" said Bonnie coldly. \"Now let\u0027s hear your ideas.\" \"No, wait,\" Elena said. \"Bonnie, wait a moment.\" She was thinking about something, something that had been nagging at her for quite a while, ever since- \"Ever since the church,\" she said aloud, remembering it. \"Do you know, I saw Robert outside the church, too, when I was hidden in the choir loft. It was just before the dogs attacked, and he was sort of backing away like he knew what was going to happen.\" \"Oh, but Elena-\" Soberly, after a moment\u0027s hesitation, Bonnie did. \"Who else?\" she said. \"Well, Alaric, I\u0027m afraid,\" Elena said. \"I\u0027m sorry, Bonnie, but he\u0027s practically number one.\" She told what she had overheard that morning between Alaric and the principal. \"He isn\u0027t a normal history teacher; they called him here for some reason. He knows I\u0027m a vampire, and he\u0027s looking for me. And today, while the dogs were attacking, he was standing there on the sidelines making some kind of weird gestures. He\u0027s definitely not what he seems, and the only question is: what is he? Are you listening, Meredith?\" \"Yes. You know, I think you should put Mrs. Flowers on that list. Remember the way she stood at the window of the boarding-house when we were bringing Stefan back from the well? But she wouldn\u0027t come downstairs to open the door for us? That\u0027s odd behavior.\" Elena nodded. \"Yes, and how she kept hanging up on me when I called him. And she certainly keeps to herself in that old house. She may just be a dotty old lady, but put her down anyway, Bonnie.\" She ran a hand through her hair, lifting it off the back of her neck. She was hot. Or-not hot exactly, but uncomfortable in some way that was similar to being overheated. She felt parched. \"All right, we\u0027ll go by the boardinghouse tomorrow before school,\" Meredith said. \"Meanwhile, what else can we be doing? Let\u0027s have a look at that list, Bonnie.\" Bonnie held the list out so they could see it, and Elena and Meredith leaned forward and read: Matt Honeycutt Vickie Bennett Robert Maxwell-What was he doing at the church when the dogs attacked? And what was going on that night with Elena\u0027s aunt? Alaric Saltzman-Why does he ask so many questions? What was he called to Fell\u0027s Church to do? Mrs. Flowers-Why does she act so strange? Why didn\u0027t she let us in the night Stefan was wounded? \"Good,\" Elena said. \"I guess we could also find out whose dogs were at the church today. And you can watch Alaric at school tomorrow.\" \"I\u0027ll watch Alaric,\" Bonnie said firmly. \"And I\u0027ll get him cleared of suspicion; you see if I don\u0027t.\" \"Fine, you do that. You can be assigned to him. And Meredith can investigate Mrs. Flowers, and I can take Robert. And as for Stefan and Damon-well, they can be assigned to everyone, because they can use their Powers to probe people\u0027s minds. Besides, that list is by no means complete. I\u0027m going to ask them to scout around town searching for any signs of Power, or anything else weird going on. They\u0027re more likely than I am to recognize it.\" \"Fine, you do that. You can be assigned to him. And Meredith can investigate Mrs. Flowers, and I can take Robert. And as for Stefan and Damon-well, they can be assigned to everyone, because they can use their Powers to probe people\u0027s minds. Besides, that list is by no means complete. I\u0027m going to ask them to scout around town searching for any signs of Power, or anything else weird going on. They\u0027re more likely than I am to recognize it.\" \"Elena. Elena!\" Startled, Elena looked up, to see Meredith\u0027s wary dark eyes and Bonnie\u0027s alarmed expression. It was only then that she realized she was crouched close to Bonnie\u0027s wrist, rubbing the biggest vein with her finger. \"Sorry,\" she murmured, sitting back. But she could feel the extra length and sharpness of her canine teeth. It was something like wearing braces; she could clearly feel the difference in weight. She realized her reassuring smile at Bonnie was not having the desired effect. Bonnie was looking scared, which was silly. Bonnie ought to know that Elena would never hurt her. And Elena wasn\u0027t very hungry tonight; Elena had always been a light eater. She could get all she needed from this tiny vein here in the wrist... Elena jumped to her feet and spun toward the window, leaning against the casing, feeling the cool night air blowing on her skin. She felt dizzy, and she couldn\u0027t seem to get her breath. What had she been doing? She turned around to see Bonnie huddled close to Meredith, both of them looking sick with fear. She hated having them look at her that way. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \"I didn\u0027t mean to, Bonnie. Look, I\u0027m not coming any closer. I should have eaten before I came here. Damon said I\u0027d get hungry later.\" Bonnie swallowed, looking even sicker. \"Eaten?\" \"Yes, of course,\" Elena said tartly. Her veins were burning; that was what this feeling was. Stefan had described it before, but she\u0027d never really understood; she\u0027d never realized what he was going through when the need for blood was on him. It was terrible, irresistible. \"What do you think I eat these days, air?\" she added defiantly. \"I\u0027m a hunter now, and I\u0027d better go out hunting.\" Bonnie and Meredith were trying to cope; she could tell they were, but she could also see the revulsion in their eyes. She concentrated on using her new senses, in opening herself to the night and searching for Stefan\u0027s or Damon\u0027s presence. It was difficult, because neither of them was projecting with his mind as he had been the night they\u0027d been fighting in the woods, but she thought she could sense a glimmer of Power out there in the town. When the bulb was finally screwed back in, it revealed Damon sitting casually but precariously on the sill of the open window, one knee up. He was smiling one of his wildest smiles. \"Do you mind?\" he said. \"This is uncomfortable.\" Elena glanced back at Bonnie and Meredith, who were braced against the closet, looking horrified and hypnotized at once. She herself shook her head, exasperated. \"And I thought I liked to make a dramatic entrance,\" she said. \"Very funny, Damon. Now let\u0027s go.\" \"With two such beautiful friends of yours right here?\" Damon smiled again at Bonnie and Meredith. \"Besides, I only just got here. Won\u0027t somebody be polite and ask me in?\" Bonnie\u0027s brown eyes, fixed helplessly on his face, softened a bit. Her lips, which had been parted in horror, parted further. Elena recognized the signs of imminent meltdown. \"No, they won\u0027t,\" she said. She put herself directly between Damon and the other girls. \"Nobody here is for you, Damon-not now, not ever.\" Seeing the flare of challenge in his eyes, she added archly, \"And anyway, I\u0027m leaving. I don\u0027t know about you, but I\u0027m going hunting.\" She was reassured to sense Stefan\u0027s presence nearby, on the roof probably, and to hear his instant amendment: We\u0027re going hunting, Damon. You can sit there all night if you want. Damon gave in with good grace, shooting one last amused glance toward Bonnie before disappearing from the window. Bonnie and Meredith both started forward in alarm as he did, obviously concerned that he had just fallen to his death. \"He\u0027s fine,\" said Elena, shaking her head again. \"And don\u0027t worry, I won\u0027t let him come back. I\u0027ll meet you at the same time tomorrow. Good-bye.\" \"But-Elena-\" Meredith stopped. \"I mean, I was going to ask you if you wanted to change your clothes.\" Elena regarded herself. The nineteenth-century heirloom dress was tattered and bedraggled, the thin white muslin shredded in some places. But there was no time to change it; she had to feed now. \"It\u0027ll have to wait,\" she said. \"See you tomorrow.\" And she boosted herself out of the window the way Damon had. The last she saw of them, Meredith and Bonnie were staring after her dazedly. \"Your cloak,\" she said, pleased. For a moment they smiled at each other, remembering the first time he had given her the cloak, after he\u0027d saved her from Tyler in the graveyard and taken her back to his room to clean up. He\u0027d been afraid to touch her then. But, Elena thought, smiling up into his eyes, she had taken care of that fear rather quickly. \"I thought we were hunting,\" Damon said. Elena turned the smile on him, without unlinking her hand from Stefan\u0027s. \"We are,\" she said. \"Where should we go?\" \"Any house on this street,\" Damon suggested. \"The woods,\" Stefan said. \"The woods,\" Elena decided. \"We don\u0027t touch humans, and we don\u0027t kill. Isn\u0027t that how it goes, Stefan?\" He returned the pressure of her fingers. \"That\u0027s how it goes,\" he said quietly. Damon\u0027s lip curled fastidiously. \"And just what are we looking for in the woods, or don\u0027t I want to know? Muskrat? Skunk? Termites?\" His eyes moved to Elena and his voice dropped. \"Come with me, and I\u0027ll show you some real hunting.\" \"We can go through the graveyard,\" Elena said, ignoring him. \"White-tailed deer feed all night in the open areas,\" Stefan told her, \"but we\u0027ll have to be careful stalking them; they can hear almost as well as we can.\" Another time, then, Damon\u0027s voice said in Elena\u0027s mind.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vampire-diaries-the-fury-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-7.html","bookId":2033,"book":{"id":2033,"title":"The Vampire Diaries: The Fury (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: This book begins with the newly \"turned\" Elena watching Damon and Stefan engaged in a fight to the death.
