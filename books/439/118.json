{"id":45153,"no":118,"title":"CHAPTER IX. SI TAKES HIS BOYS FOR A LITTLE MARCH INTO THE COUNTRY.","content":"\"SI,\" said the Orderly-Sergeant, \"here\u0027s a chance to give them pin-feather roosters o\u0027 yours a little taste of active service, that\u0027ll be good seasoning for \u0027em, and help develop their hackles and spurs.\" \"Good idee. What is it?\" responded Si with alacrity. \"An order\u0027s come down from Headquarters to detail a Sergeant and eight men from the company to go out about eight or 10 miles in the country, and take a turn guarding a little mill they\u0027re running out there, grinding meal. There\u0027s a gang of bushwhackers around there, that occasionally pester the men at work and they\u0027ve tried once to burn the mill. I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll have much trouble, but you\u0027ve got to keep your eye peeled, and not let any of your boys go to sleep on post.\" \"I\u0027ll look out for that.\" \"I know you will. You\u0027ll take Shorty along, and your seven kids, which\u0027ll make up the number. You\u0027ll draw three days\u0027 rations, at the end of which time you\u0027ll be relieved.\" \"Now, boys,\" said Si, returning to his squad, \"we won\u0027t drill today, but are going out on some real soldierin\u0027. The Kurnel has given us a very important detail.\" The boys swelled up visibly at the news. \"I want you to all act like soldiers, now,\" continued Si, \"and be a credit to the company and the rijiment. We\u0027re goin\u0027 to be all by ourselves, and everybody\u0027s eyes \u0027ll be on us.\" \"Yes,\" echoed Shorty, \"we\u0027ll be the only part o\u0027 the rijiment at the front, and we want to git a good stiff brace on ourselves, because if we don\u0027t some o\u0027 these other rijiments may git the grand laugh on us.\" Shorty\u0027s tone was that this was a calamity to which death was preferable, and the boys were correspondingly impressed. They were rapidly learning the lesson that the regiment and its reputation were the most important things in the whole world. \"Come along, and le\u0027s draw our rations,\" said Si. \"And you boys want to keep in mind that this\u0027s all you\u0027ll git for three days, and govern yourselves accordingly. The \u0027Leventh Commandment is to take all that you kin git, and take mighty good care of it after you git it—\" \"For sich is the Kingdom of Heaven,\" interjected Shorty, imitating the Chaplain\u0027s tone. \"No,\" said Si, who was irritated by his partner\u0027s irreverence: \"but it\u0027s the way a good soldier does. His first dooty\u0027s to take care o\u0027 his grub, because that\u0027s takin\u0027 care o\u0027 himself, and keepin\u0027 himself in good shape to do the dooty the Government expects o\u0027 him. \u0027Tain\u0027t servin\u0027 the Government right for him to be careless about himself. Now here\u0027s 27 rations o\u0027 bread, meat, coffee, sugar, salt and beans—three apiece for each of us. Harry Joslyn, you and Gid Mack divide them up into nine equal piles.\" Si and Shorty turned to give directions about packing up the shelter-tents and blankets for carrying. \"Now, Gid Mackall,\" said Harry, \"play fair, if you ever did in your life. I won\u0027t have none o\u0027 your shenanniging.\" \"Don\u0027t talk to me about shenanniging, you little imp,\" responded Gid cordially. \"You can\u0027t do a straight thing if you try, and you never try. You never fisted-up with me on a ball-bat that you didn\u0027t slip your hand so\u0027s to come out ahead.\" \"Now, there\u0027s three loaves o\u0027 bread for the Sargint,\" said Harry, laying them down on a newspaper. \"There\u0027s three for the Corpril; there\u0027s three for me; there\u0027s three for you.\" \"Here, what\u0027re you givin\u0027 me that broken loaf for?\" demanded Gid, stopping in his distribution of meat. \"Give that to Pete Skidmore. He\u0027s the littlest.\" \"Ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to do nothin\u0027 o\u0027 the kind,\" responded Harry. \"You\u0027ve got to take things as they come. That loaf fell to you, and you\u0027ve got to keep it.\" \"If you don\u0027t take that nubbin loaf away and put a full one in its place, not a speck o\u0027 lean meat \u0027ll you get—nothin\u0027 but fat six inches thick.\" \"You\u0027ll cut that meat straight across, and give me my right share o\u0027 lean, you puddin\u0027-headed, sandhill crane,\" shouted Harry. \"Who\u0027re you a-calling names, you bow-legged little shrimp?\" shouted Gid, slapping Harry across the face with a piece of fat pork. An angry mix-up, school boy rules, followed, to the great detriment of the rations. Si and Shorty rushed up, separated the combatants, and administered shakes, cuffs, and sharp reprimands. \"Now, you quarrelsome little whelps,\" said Si, after quiet had been restored, \"you\u0027ve got to take them rations that you\u0027ve spiled for yourselves. You shan\u0027t have no other. Put that bread and that meat you\u0027ve kicked around into your own haversacks. Then go back there and roll up your blankets—same as the other boys. Alf Russell, you and Jim Humphreys come here and divide the rest o\u0027 these rations into seven parts, if you kin do it without fightin\u0027.\" The division of the rations proceeded, with some jars between Russell and Humphreys over the apportionment of fat and lean meat, and angry protests from little Pete Skidmore because they made his share smaller than anybody else\u0027s. \"Yit,\" said he, \"I\u0027ve got to march just as far as any of you, carry just as big a gun, and do just as much shootin\u0027.\" \"You\u0027re wrong,\" said the medical-minded Alf Russell. \"You ought to have less than the others, because you\u0027re smaller. The littler and younger the person the smaller the dose, always.\" \"No,\" acceded the farmer Jim Humphreys. \"Tain\u0027t natural, nor right. You don\u0027t give a colt as much feed as you do a grown horse. Anybody knows that.\" \"Pete\u0027s plea is sound,\" contraverted the legal-minded Monty Scruggs. \"All men are equal before the law, though they mayn\u0027t be a foot high. Rations are a matter of law, and the law\u0027s no respecter of persons.\" \"Rations is intended,\" persisted Alf, \"to give a man what he needs to eat—nothing more, nothing less. Pete don\u0027t need as much as a man; why give it to him? There\u0027d be just as much sense in giving him the clothes for a six-footer.\" \"All o\u0027 you are always imposin\u0027 on me \u0027cause I\u0027m little,\" whimpered Pete. \"And that stuck-up Alf Russell\u0027s the worst of all. Just because he\u0027s goin\u0027 to be a doctor, and leads in singin\u0027 at church, he thinks he knows more\u0027n the man what writ the arithmetic, and he\u0027s down on me because I won\u0027t take all he says for law and gospel, in spite of his airs. Jim Humphreys is down on me, because I writ home that I\u0027d shot a man back there at the burnt bridge, and Jim got skeered at a coon-huntin\u0027 nigger.\" \"Never mind, Pete,\" said Monty consolingly, \"none o\u0027 them shall impose on you while I\u0027m around. Now, Alf, you and Jim give Pete just as much as the rest, or I\u0027ll make you.\" \"Who\u0027ll you make, you brindle steer?\" said Alf, laying down his bread and bristling up. \"Stand back, Alf; he meant me,\" said Jim, disposing his meat, and approaching Monty with doubled fists. \"Now, Mister Scruggs, le\u0027s see you do some makin\u0027, since you\u0027re so brash.\" \"Here, stop that, you little scamps,\" shouted Si, whose attention had been so far devoted to quieting Harry and Gid, and showing them how to prepare their traps for marching. \"Great Scott, can\u0027t you git along without fightin\u0027? I\u0027m goin\u0027 to take you where you\u0027ll git real fightin\u0027 enough to satisfy you. \"Go ahead, there, and divide them rations, as I ordered you, and be quick about it, for we must hurry off.\" The mention of real fighting immediately sobered up the boys, and made them forget their squabbles. They hurried about their work with quickened zeal. \"Now,\" said Si, \"pack your rations carefully in your haversacks, just as you see me and Corpril Elliott doin\u0027. First, keep your sugar, coffee and salt separate. Put \u0027em in little tin boxes, like these, and see that the lids are on tight. Hurry up, now. Shorty, you\u0027d better look over the boxes, and go up and draw as many cartridges as you think we\u0027ll need.\" The mention of need for cartridges was an electric impulse which set the boys keenly alive. They bundled their rations into their haversacks, and flung their blanket rolls over their shoulders, and were standing in a state of palpitating expectancy, when Shorty came back with his hands full of cartridges, which he proceeded to distribute. \"Take arms,\" commanded Si. \"Forward!—March!\" Si and Shorty started off with their long, easy campaign stride, which, in some incomprehensible way that the veteran only learns by practice, brought their feet down every time in exactly the right place, avoiding all stumbling-blocks, and covering without apparent effort a long distance in the course of an hour. The boys pattered industriously after, doing their best to keep up, but stumbling over roots and stones, and slipping on steep places, and dropping to the rear in spite of themselves. When Si made the customary halt at the end of the first hour, his little command was strung back for a quarter of a mile, and little Pete Skidmore was out of sight. \"Better go back and look for little Pete, Shorty,\" said Si. \"We seem to be losin\u0027 him.\" Pete was soon brought up, panting and tired. \"Dod durn it, what\u0027re you all runnin\u0027 away from me for?\" he gasped. \"Want to lose me? Want to git into the fight all by yourselves, and leave me out? Think because I\u0027m little I can\u0027t help? I kin shoot as well as anybody in the crowd, dod durn you.\" \"There, you see the nonsense o\u0027 giving you as much rations as the others,\" suggested Alf Russell. \"You can\u0027t pack \u0027em, and you wouldn\u0027t need \u0027em if you did pack \u0027em.\" \"What business is it of yours. Mister Russell, I\u0027d like to know,\" asked Monty Scruggs, \"what he does with his rations. His rations are his rights, and he\u0027s entitled to \u0027em. It\u0027s nobody\u0027s business what use a man makes of his rights.\" \"Where are these rebels that we\u0027re goin\u0027 to fight?\" asked Harry Joslyn, eagerly scanning the horizon. \"I\u0027ve been looking for \u0027em all along, but couldn\u0027t see none. Was you in such a hurry for fear they\u0027d get away, and have they got away?\" \"I wasn\u0027t in no hurry,\" answered Si. \"That was only regler marchin\u0027 gait.\" \"Holy smoke,\" murmured the rest, wiping their foreheads; \"we thought you was trying to run the rebels down.\" \"Don\u0027t be discouraged, boys,\" said Si. \"You\u0027ll soon git used to marchin\u0027 that way right along, and never thinking of it. It may seem a little hard now, but it won\u0027t last long. I guess you\u0027re rested enough. Attention! Forward!—March!\" Si and Shorty had mercifully intended to slow down a little, and not push the boys. But as they pulled out they forgot themselves, and fell again into their long, swinging stride, that soon strung the boys out worse than ever, especially as they were not now buoyed up by an expectation of meeting the enemy. \"We must march slower. Si,\" said Shorty, glancing ruefully back, \"or we\u0027ll lose every blamed one o\u0027 them boys. They\u0027re too green yit.\" \"That\u0027s so,\" accorded Si. \"It\u0027s like tryin\u0027 to make a grass-bellied horse run a quarter-stretch.\" \"Might I inquire,\" asked Monty Scruggs, as he came up, wiped his face and sat down on a rock, \"whether this is what you\u0027d call a forced march, or merely a free-will trial trot for a record.\" \"Neither,\" answered Si. \"It\u0027s only a common, straight, every-day march out into the country. You kin count upon one a day like this for the rest o\u0027 your natural lives—I mean your service. It\u0027s part o\u0027 what you enlisted for. And this\u0027s only a beginnin\u0027. Some days you\u0027ll have to keep this up 15 or 18 hours at a stretch.\" There was a general groan of dismay. \"Gracious, I wish I\u0027d wings, or that I\u0027d enlisted in the cavalry,\" sighed Harry. \"Brace up! Brace up!\" said Shorty. \"You\u0027ll soon git used to it, and make your 40 miles a day like the rest of us, carrying your bed-clothes and family groceries with you. It\u0027s all in gittin\u0027 used to it, as the man said who\u0027d bin skinnin\u0027 eels for 40 years, and that now they didn\u0027t mind it a bit.\" \"Well, le\u0027s jog along,\" said Si. \"We ought to git there in another hour. There\u0027s a big rain comin\u0027 up, and we want to git under cover before it strikes us. Forward!—March!\" But the rain was nearer that Si thought. It came, as the Spring rains come in the North Georgia mountains—as if Niagara had been shifted into the clouds overhead. The boys were literally washed off the road, and clung to saplings to avoid being carried away into the brush. \"I\u0027ll fall back and keep the boys together,\" said Shorty, as soon as an intermission allowed them to speak. \"Alright,\" said Si. \"Look out for little Pete.\" And Si began to forge stolidly ahead. \"Goodness, Sarjint, you\u0027re not going to travel in such a storm as this,\" gasped Gid Mackall. \"Certainly,\" Si called back. \"Come on. We\u0027ve got to reach that mill tonight, no matter what happens. You\u0027d might as well be drowned marchin\u0027 as standin\u0027 still. \u0027Tain\u0027t rainin\u0027 no worse further ahead than here. Forward!\" Close Up, Boys. 111 \"Close up, boys,\" said Shorty, taking little Pete\u0027s gun and the youngster\u0027s hand. \"This\u0027s only a Spring shower. \u0027Tain\u0027t nothin\u0027 to what we had on the Tullyhomy Campaign. There the drops was as big as punkins, and come as thick as the grains on a ear o\u0027 corn. Close up, there; dodge the big drops, and go ahead.\" \"Hold on to me tight! Hold on to me!\" clamored little Pete. \"If you don\u0027t I\u0027ll be washed away and lost for sure.\" \"Come along, Peter, my son,\" Shorty assured him. \"I hain\u0027t never lost no children yit, and I hain\u0027t goin\u0027 to begin with you.\" The storm grew more violent every minute, limbs were torn from the trees, and fell with a crash, and torrents rushed down from the mountain side, across the road. Si strode on resolutely, as if the disturbance were nothing more than a Summer zephyr. He waded squarely through the raging streams, turning at times to help the next boy to him, strode over the fallen limbs, and took the dashing downpour with stolid indifference. \"Close up, boys! Close up!\" shouted Shorty from time to time, \"Don\u0027t mind a little sprinkle like this. It\u0027ll lay the dust, and make marchin\u0027 easier. Come along, Peter, my son. I\u0027m not goin\u0027 to lose you.\" Night suddenly came, with pitchy darkness, but Si steadily forged onward. Then the rain ceased as suddenly as it began, but the road was encumbered with fallen timber and swirling races of muddy water. They seemed more uncomfortable even than when the rain was falling. They were now nearing the mill, and the sound of a fitful musketry fire came to their ears. \"They\u0027ve sneaked up in the storm to attack the mill,\" Si called out to Shorty. \"Close up and prepare for action.\" \"Goodness,\" gasped Gid Mackall, much of whose vim had been soaked out of him by the fearful downpour, and who was oppressed by fatigue, hunger, and the dense blackness of the night in the strange woods. \"You don\u0027t have to fight when you\u0027re wetter\u0027n a drowned rat, and so tired you\u0027re ready to drop, do you?\" \"That\u0027s what you do,\" said Shorty, wiping off his musket. \"That\u0027s the way you\u0027ll have to do most o\u0027 your fightin\u0027. The miserabler you feel the miserabler you want to make the other fellers feel. Boys, turn your guns upside down and let the water run out. Then half-cock \u0027em, and blow into \u0027em to clean the water out o\u0027 the tubes. Then find a dry rag somewhere about you, and wipe off the nipples. We want every gun to go off when the order is given. Don\u0027t anybody load till Si gives the order.\" The drenched but excited boys followed his directions with nervous haste. Shorty took one gun after another and examined it, while Si went forward a little ways to reconnoiter. The calm deliberation of the partners steadied the nervous boys. \"Load,\" called back Si, from the vantage ground of a little knoll, upon which he was standing, trying to see into the darkness beyond. A volley from out in front responded to the sound of his voice, and bullets knocked bark off the big chestnut behind which he had shrewdly taken refuge. \"Jest as I expected, Si,\" Shorty called back to him. \"The rebels have throwed back a squad to watch for us.\" \"Yes,\" said Si, coolly, as he stepped back to meet the boys. \"There ain\u0027t but 10 o\u0027 them, though. I counted every flash and located \u0027em. They\u0027re all in a bunch right over there by a dead tree to the left. Move up there quick, aim a little to the left. Aim low, and fire just as we reach the rise. I\u0027ll fire first, and the rest of you foller. Try to hit something, every one of you.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63305.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
