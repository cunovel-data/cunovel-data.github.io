{"id":45078,"no":43,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. THE DEACON IS TROUBLED","content":"DISPOSES OF THE $500 \"WHISKY\" MONEY AND GOES OUT FORAGING. \n \n FROM the door of the cabin the Deacon could see the fort on which the boys were piling up endless cubic yards of the red soil of Tennessee. As he watched them, with an occasional glance at the beans seething in the kettle, fond memories rose of a woman far away on the Wabash, who these many years had thought and labored for his comfort in their home, while he labored within her sight on their farm. It was the first time in their long married life that he had been away from her for such a length of time. \n \n \"I believe I\u0027m gittin\u0027 real homesick to see Mariar,\" he said with a sigh. \"I\u0027d give a good deal for a letter from her. I do hope everything on the farm\u0027s all right. I think it is. I\u0027m a little worried about Brown Susy, the mare, but I think she\u0027ll pick up as the weather settles. I hope her fool colt, that I\u0027ve give Si, won\u0027t break his leg nor nothin\u0027 while I\u0027m away.\" \n \n Presently he saw the men quit work, and he turned to get ready for the boys. He covered the rough table with newspapers to do duty for a cloth; he had previously scoured up the tinware to its utmost brightness and cleanliness, and while the boys were230 washing off the accumulations of clay, and liberally denouncing the man who invented fort building, and even West Point for educating men to pursue the nefarious art, he dished out the smoking viands. \n \n \"Upon my word, Pap,\" said Si, as he helped him self liberally, \"you do beat us cookin\u0027 all holler. Your beans taste almost as good as mother\u0027s. We must git you to give us some lessons.\" \n \n \"Yes; you\u0027re a boss cook,\" said Shorty, with his mouth full. \"Better not let Gen. Rosecrans find out how well you kin bile beans, or he\u0027ll have you drafted, and keep you with him till the end o\u0027 the war.\" \n \n After supper they lighted their pipes and seated themselves in front of the fire. \n \n \"How\u0027d you git along to-day, Pap,\" said Si. \"I hope you didn\u0027t have no trouble.\" \n \n The Deacon took his pipe out of his mouth, blew a cloud of smoke, and considered a moment before replying. He did not want to recount his experiences, at least, until he had digested them more thoroughly. He was afraid of the joking of the boys, and still more that the story would get back home. Then, he was still sorely perplexed about the disposition of the money. He had not thought that out yet, by a great deal. But the question was plump and direct, and concealment and untruth were alike absolutely foreign to his nature. After a minute\u0027s pause he decided to tell the whole story. \n \n \"Well, boys,\" he began with a shamefaced look, \"I had the flamboyantest racket to-day I\u0027ve had yit.\" \n \n The two boys took their pipes out and regarded him with surprise.231 \n \n \"Yes,\" he continued, with a deep sigh, \"it laid away over gittin\u0027 down here, and my night in the guard-house, even. You see, after you went away I began to think about gittin\u0027 up something a little extry for you to eat. I thought about it for awhile, and then recollected seein\u0027 a little grocery that\u0027d been set up nigh here in a board shanty.\" \n \n \"Yes, we know about it,\" said Shorty, exchanging a look with Si. \n \n \"Well,\" continued the Deacon, \"I concluded that I\u0027d jest slip over there, and mebbe I could find232 something that\u0027d give variety to your pork and beans. He didn\u0027t seem to have much but canned goods, and his prices wuz jest awful. But I wuz de termined to git something, and I finally bought a jug o\u0027 genuine Injianny maple molasses, a chunk o\u0027 cheese and a can o\u0027 peaches. I had to pay $5 for it. He said he had to charge high prices on account o\u0027 freight rates, and I remembered that I had some trouble in gittin\u0027 things down here, and so I paid him. He wuz very peart and sassy, and it was take-it-or-leave-it-and-be-plaguey- quick-about-it all the time. But I paid my $5, gathered the things up, and started back to the house. I hadn\u0027t got more\u0027n 100 rods away when I met one o\u0027 these officers with only one o\u0027 them things in his shoulder straps.\" \n \n \"A First Lieutenant,\" interjected Si. \n \n \"Yes, they called him a Lieutenant. He spoke very bossy and cross to me, and hit my jug a welt with his sword. He broke it, and what do you suppose was in it?\" \n \n Hit My Jug a Welt With his Sword 231 \n \n \"Whisky,\" said Si and Shorty simultaneously, with a shout of laughter. \n \n \"That\u0027s jest what it wuz. I wuz never so mortified in my life. I couldn\u0027t say a word. The Lieutenant abused me for being a partner in sellin\u0027 whisky to the soldiers me, Josiah Klegg, Patriarch of the Sons o\u0027 Temperance, and a Deacon. While I wuz tryin\u0027 to tell him he jabbed his sword into the can o\u0027 peaches, and what do you suppose was in that?\" \n \n \"Whisky,\" yelled Si and Shorty, with another burst of laughter. \n \n \"That\u0027s jest what it wuz. Then one o\u0027 the Lieutenant\u0027s men jerked the chunk o\u0027 cheese away and283 broke it open. And what do you suppose was in that?\" \n \n \"Whisky, of course,\" yelled the boys in uncontrollable mirth. \n \n \"That\u0027s jest what it was. I wuz so dumfounded that I couldn\u0027t say a word. They yanked me around in behind the squad, and told me they\u0027d shave my head and drum me out o\u0027 camp. The Lieutenant took his men up to the grocery and tore it down, and ketched the feller that wuz keepin\u0027 it. They put him alongside o\u0027 me, and tuk us up to the guard house. On the way he whispered to me that they wuz likely to salt him, \u0027cause they knowed him, but I\u0027d likely git off easy. He\u0027d made $500 clean out o\u0027 the business already, and had it in his clothes. He\u0027d pass it over to me to keep till the racket wuz over, when he\u0027d divide fair and square with me. I told him that I\u0027d rather burn my hand off than tech a dirty dollar o\u0027 his money, but he dropt it into my overcoat pocket all the same, and I wuz so excited that I clean forgot about it, and brung it away with me. When we got to the guard-house they tuk all the rest of his money away, shaved his head, and drummed him out o\u0027 camp.\" \n \n \"Yes, we saw that,\" answered Si; \"but didn\u0027t pay no attention to it. They\u0027re drummin\u0027 some feller out o\u0027 camp nearly every day, for something or other.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t see that it does any good,\" said Shorty. \"It\u0027d be a heap better to set \u0027em to work on the fortifications. That\u0027d take the deviltry out o\u0027 \u0027em.\" \n \n \"When they\u0027d got through with him,\" continued the Deacon, \"they Burned their attention to me. I234 never wuz so scared in all my born days. But luckily, jest in the nick o\u0027 time, I ketched sight o\u0027 Capt. McGillicuddy, and hollered to him. He come up and explained things, and they let me go, with lots o\u0027 apologies. When I got back to the house, I felt for my handkerchief, and found that scalawag\u0027s roll o\u0027 bills, which I\u0027d clean forgot. Here it is.\" \n \n \u0027pulled out a Fat Roll of Greenbacks. 235 \n \n He pulled out a fat roll of crisp greenbacks. Si took them, thumbed them over admiringly, counted them, and handed them to Shorty, who did the same. \n \n \"Yes, there\u0027s $500 there,\" said Si. \"What are you goin\u0027 to do with it, Pap?\" \n \n \"That\u0027s jest what\u0027s worrying the life out o\u0027 me,\" answered his father. \"By rights I ought to throw the condemned stuff into the fire, only I hold it a great sin to destroy property of any kind.\" \n \n \"What, burn all that good money up?\" said Shorty with a whistle. \"You don\u0027t live in an insane asylum when you\u0027re at home, do you?\" \n \n \"\u0027Twouldn\u0027t be right to burn it, Pap,\" said Si, who better understood the rigidity of his father\u0027s principles. \"It\u0027d do a mighty sight o\u0027 good somewhere.\" \n \n \"The money don\u0027t belong at all to that feller,\" mused the Deacon. \"A man can\u0027t have no property in likker. It\u0027s wet damnation, hell\u0027s broth, to nourish murderers, thieves, and paupers. It is the devil\u0027s essence, with which he makes widows and orphans. Every dollar of it is minted with women\u0027s tears and children\u0027s cries of hunger. That feller got the money by violatin\u0027 the law on the one hand and swindling the soldiers on the other, and corruptin\u0027 them to their ruin. To give the money back to him would be rewardin\u0027 him for his rascality. It\u0027d be like235 givin\u0027 a thief his booty, or a burglar his plunder, and make me his pardner.\" \n \n \"You\u0027re right there, Pap,\" assented Si. \"You\u0027d jest be settin\u0027 him up in business in some other stand. Five hundred dollars\u0027d give him a good start. His hair\u0027ll soon grow agin.\" \n \n \"The worst of it,\" sighed Shorty, \"is that it ain\u0027t good likker. Otherwise it\u0027d be different. But it\u0027s pizener than milk-sick or loco-weed. It\u0027s aqua-fortis, fish-berries, tobacco juice and ratsbane. That stuff\u0027d eat a hole in a tin pan.\"236 \n \n \"The Captain turned the rest o\u0027 his money over to the hospital,\" continued the Deacon. \"I might do that.\" \n \n \"Never do it in the world, Pap,\" protested Si. \"Better burn it up at once. It\u0027d be the next worst thing to givin\u0027 it back to him. It\u0027d jest be pamperin\u0027 and encouragin\u0027 a lot o\u0027 galoots that lay around the hospitals to keep out o\u0027 fights. None o\u0027 the wounded or really sick\u0027d git the benefit of a cent of it. They wuz all sent away weeks ago to Nashville, Louisville, and back home. You jest ought to see that bummer gang. Last week me and Shorty wuz on fatigue duty down by one o\u0027 the hospitals. There wuzzent nobody in the hospital but a few \u0027shell-fever\u0027 shirks, who\u0027re too lazy to work on the fortifications, and we saw a crowd of civilians and men in uniform set down to a finer dinner than you kin git in any hotel. Shorty wanted to light some shells and roll in amongst \u0027em, but I knowed that it\u0027d jest make a muss that we\u0027d have to clean up afterward.\" \n \n \"But what am I going to do with it?\" asked the Deacon despairingly. \"I don\u0027t want no money in my hands that don\u0027t belong to me, and especially sich money as that, which seems to have a curse to every bill. If we could only find out the men he tuk it from.\" \n \n \"Be about as easy as drivin\u0027 a load o\u0027 hay back into the field, and fitting each spear o\u0027 grass back on the stalk from which it was cut,\" interjected Shorty. \n \n \"Or I might send it anonymously to the Baptist Board o\u0027 Missions,\" continued the Deacon. \n \n \"Nice way to treat the little heathens,\" objected Si. \"Send them likker money.\"237 \n \n The Deacon groaned. \n \n \"Tell you what we might do, Pap,\" said Si, as a bright idea struck him. \"There\u0027s a widder, a union woman, jest outside the lines, whose house wuz burned down by the rebels. She could build a splendid new house with $100 better\u0027n the one she wuz livin\u0027 in before. Send her $100. \n \n \"Not a bad idee,\" said the Deacon approvingly, as he poked the ashes in his pipe with his little finger. \n \n \"And, Pap,\" continued Si, encouraged by the reception of this suggestion, \"there\u0027s poor Bill Ellerlee, who lost his leg in the fight. He used to drink awful hard, and most of his money went down his throat. He\u0027s got a wife and two small children, and they hain\u0027t a cent to live on, except what the neighbors gives. Why not put up $200 in an express pack age and send it to him, marked \u0027from an unknown friend?\u0027\" \n \n \"Good,\" accorded the Deacon. \n \n \"And Jim Pocock,\" put in Shorty, seeing the drift. \"He\u0027s gone home with a bullet through his breast. His folks are pretty poor. Why not send him $100 the same way?\" \n \n \"Excellent idee,\" said the father. \n \n \"That leaves $100 yit,\" said Si. \"If you care to, you kin divide it between Shorty and me, and we\u0027ll use it among the boys that got hurt, and need some thing.\" \n \n A dubious look came into the Deacon\u0027s face. \n \n \"You needn\u0027t be afeared of us, Pap,\" said Si, with a little blush. \"I kin promise you that we won\u0027t use a cent ourselves, but give every bit where it is really needed.\"238 \n \n \"I believe you, my son,\" said the Deacon heartily. \"We\u0027ll do jest as you say.\" \n \n They spent the evening carrying their plan into execution. \n \n At the 9 o\u0027clock roll-call the Orderly-Sergeant announced: \n \n \"Co. Q to go out with a forage-train to-morrow morning.\" \n \n This was joyful news a delightful variation from the toil on the fortifications. \"Taps\" found every body getting his gun and traps ready for an excursion into the country. \n \n \"You\u0027d like to go with us, Pap, wouldn\u0027t you?\" asked Si, as he looked over his cartridge-box to see what it contained. \n \n \"Indeed I would,\" replied the father. \"I\u0027ll go any where with you rather than spend such another day in camp. You don\u0027t think you will see any rebels, do you?\" he asked rather nervously. \n \n \"Don\u0027t know; never kin tell,\" said Shorty oracularly. \"Rebels is anywhere you find \u0027em. Sometimes they\u0027re seldomer than a chaw of terbaker in a Sunday school. You can\u0027t find one in a whole County. Then, the first thing you know, they\u0027re thicker\u0027n fleas on a dog\u0027s back. But we won\u0027t likely see no rebels to-morrow. There ain\u0027t no great passel o\u0027 them this side o\u0027 Duck River. Still, we\u0027ll take our guns along, jest like a man wears a breast-pin on a dark night, because he\u0027s used to it.\" \n \n \"Can\u0027t you give me a gun, too? I think it\u0027d be company for me,\" said the Deacon. \n \n \"Certainly,\" said Si. \n \n The Deacon stowed himself in the wagons with239 the rest the next morning, and rode out with them through the bright sunshine, that gave promise of the soon oncoming of Spring. For miles they jolted over the execrable roads and through the shiftless, run-down country before they found anything worth while putting in the wagons. \n \n \"Great country, Pap,\" said Si suggestively. \n \n \"Yes; it\u0027d be a great country,\" said his father disdainfully, \"if you could put a wagonload o\u0027 manure on every foot and import some Injianny men to take care of it. The water and the sunshine down here seem all right, but the land and the people and the pigs and stock seem to be cullin\u0027s throwed out when they made Injianny.\" \n \n At length the train halted by a double log house of much more pretentious character than any they had so far seen. There were a couple of well-filled corn-cribs, a large stack of fodder, and other evidences of plenty. The Deacon\u0027s practiced eye noticed that there was no stock in the fields, but Si explained this by saying that everything on hoofs had been driven off to supply the rebel army. \"They\u0027re now trying to git a corn-crib and a fodder-stack with four legs, but hain\u0027t succeeded so far.\" \n \n The Captain ordered the fence thrown down and the wagons driven in to be filled. The surrounding horizon was scanned for signs of rebels, but none appeared anywhere. The landscape was as tranquil, as peace-breathing as a Spring morning on the Wabash, and the Deacon\u0027s mind reverted to the condition of things on his farm. It was too wet to plow, but he would like to take a walk over the fields and see how his wheat had come out, and look over the240 peach-buds and ascertain how they had stood the Winter. He noticed how some service-trees had already unfolded their white petals, like flags of truce breaking the long array of green cedars and rusty-brown oaks. \n \n The company stacked arms in the road, the Captain went to direct the filling of the wagons, and Si and Shorty started on a private reconnoissance for something for their larder. \n \n The Deacon strolled around the yard for awhile inspecting the buildings and farm implements with an eye of professional curiosity, and arrived at very unfavorable opinions. He then walked up on the porch of the house, where a woman of about his own age sat in a split-bottom rocking-chair knitting and viewing the proceedings with frowning eyes. \n \n \"Good day, ma\u0027am,\" said he. \"Warm day, ma\u0027am.\" \n \n \"\u0027Tain\u0027t as warm as it orter to be for sich fellers as yo\u0027uns,\" she snapped. \"You\u0027d better be in the brimstone pit if you had your just deserts.\" \n \n The Deacon always tried to be good-humored with an angry woman, and he thought he would try the effect of a little pleasantry. \"I\u0027m a Baptist, ma\u0027am, and they say us Baptists are tryin\u0027 to put out that fire with cold water.\" \n \n \"You a Babtist?\" she answered scornfully. \"The hot place is full o\u0027 jest sich Babtists as yo\u0027uns air, and they\u0027re making room for more. We\u0027uns air Babtists ourselves, but, thank the Lord, not o\u0027 your kind. Babtists air honest people. Babtists don\u0027t go about the country robbin\u0027 and murderin\u0027 and stealin\u0027 folks\u0027 corn. Don\u0027t tell me you air a Babtist,241 for I know you air a-lyin\u0027, and that\u0027s the next thing to killin\u0027 and stealin\u0027.\" \n \n \"But I am a Baptist,\" persisted the Deacon, \"and have bin for 30 year regular, free-will, close-communion, total-immersion Baptist. We have some Campbellites, a few Six Principle Baptists, and some Hard Shells, but the heft of us air jest plain, straight-out Baptists. But, speakin\u0027 o\u0027 cold water, kin you give me a drink? I\u0027m powerful dry.\" \n \n \"Thar\u0027s water down in the crick, thar,\" she said, with a motion of her knitting in that direction. \"It\u0027s as fur for me as it is for you. Go down thar and drink all you like. Lucky you can\u0027t carry the crick away with yo\u0027uns. Yo\u0027uns \u0027d steal it if yo\u0027uns could.\" \n \n \"You don\u0027t seem to be in a good humor, ma\u0027am,\" said the Deacon, maintaining his pleasant demeanor and tone. \n \n \"Well, if you think that a passel o\u0027 nasty Yankees is kalkerlated to put a lady in a good humor you\u0027re even a bigger fool than you look. But I hain\u0027t no time to waste jawin\u0027 you. If you want a drink thar\u0027s the crick. Go and drink your fill of it. I only wish it was a\u0027s\u0027nic, to pizen you and your whole army.\" \n \n She suddenly stopped knitting, and bent her eyes eagerly on an opening in the woods on a hill-top whence the road wound down to the house. The Deacon\u0027s eyes followed hers, and he saw unmistakable signs of men in butternut clothes. The woman saw that he noticed them, and her manner changed. \n \n \"Come inside the house,\" she said pleasantly, \"and I\u0027ll git you a gourdful of water fresh from the spring.\"242 \n \n \"Thankee, ma\u0027am; I don\u0027t feel a bit dry,\" answered the Deacon, with his eyes fastened on the hill top. \"Si, Shorty, Capt. McGillicuddy,\" he yelled. \n \n \"Shet your head, and come into the house this minit, you nasty Yankee, or I\u0027ll slash your fool head off,\" ordered the woman, picking up a corn-cutter the advantage of his position and ran up to him. \n \n The Deacon was inside the railing around the porch, and he had not jumped a fence for 20 years. But he cleared the railing as neatly as Si could have done it, and ran bareheaded down the road, yelling at the top of his voice. \n \n He was not a minute too soon not soon enough. A full company of rebel cavalry came dashing out of the woods, yelling like demons. \n \n Without waiting to form, the men of Co. Q ran to their guns and began firing from fence-corners and behind trees. Capt. McGillicuddy took the first squad that he came to, and, running forward a little way, made a hasty line and opened fire. Others saw the advantage of his position and ran up to him. \n \n The Deacon snatched up a gun and joined the Captain. \n \n \"I never wuz subject to the \u0027buck fever,\u0027\" he muttered to himself, \"and I won\u0027t allow myself to be now. I remember jest how Gineral Jackson told his men to shoot down to New Orleans. I\u0027m going to salt one o\u0027 them fellers as sure as my name\u0027s Josiah Klegg.\" \n \n He took a long breath, to steady himself, as he joined the Captain, picked out a man on a bay horse that seemed to be the rebels\u0027 Captain, and caught his breast fully through the hindsight before he243 pulled the trigger. Through the smoke he saw his man tumble from his horse. \n \n \"Got him, anyway,\" he muttered; \"now, how in the world kin I load this plaguey gun agin?\" \n \n At that instant a rebel bullet bit out a piece of his ear, but he paid no attention to it. \n \n \"Gi\u0027 me that cartridge,\" he said to the man next to him, who had just bitten off the end of one; \"I can\u0027t do it.\" \n \n The man handed him the cartridge, which the Deacon rammed home, but before he could find a cap the fight was over, and the rebels were seek ing the shelter of the woods. \n \n The Deacon managed to get a cap on his gun in time to take a long-distance, ineffective shot at the rebels as they disappeared in the woods. \n \n They hastily buried one rebel who had been killed, and picked up those who had been wounded and carried them into the house, where they were made as comfortable as possible. Among them was the man whom the Deacon had aimed at. He was found to have a wound through the fleshy part of his hip, and proved to be the son of the woman of the house. \n \n As soon as the fight was over, Si, full of solicitude, sought his father. He found him wiping the blood from his ear with his bandanna. \n \n \"It\u0027s nothin\u0027, son; absolutely nothin\u0027,\" said the old gentleman with as much pride as any recruit. \"Don\u0027t hurt as much as a scratch from a briar. Some feller what couldn\u0027t write put his mark on me so\u0027s he\u0027d know me agin. But I fetched that feller on the bay hoss. I\u0027m glad I didn\u0027t kill him, but he\u0027ll keep out o\u0027 devilment for sometime. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63230.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
