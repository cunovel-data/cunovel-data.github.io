{"id":45126,"no":91,"title":"CHAPTER IV. THE DEACON\u0027S PLAN","content":"DEALING WITH AN OBSTRUCTION TO THE HOMEWARD JOURNEY. THE Surgeon, who had conceived quite a good opinion of the Deacon\u0027s ability, readily certified that the boys could be safely taken home, since they would have the benefit of his care and attention, and the necessary papers came down from Headquarters that day. The Deacon had the good luck to find his old friend, the Herd-Boss, who took a deep interest in the matter. He offered to have as good a team as he had at the crib the next morning, with the wagon-bed filled with cedar-boughs, to make as easy a couch as possible for the rough ride over the mountains. With his heart full of hope and joy, the Deacon bustled around to make every possible preparation for the journey. \"It\u0027s a long way back home, I know,\" he said to himself, \"and the road\u0027s rough and difficult as that to the New Jerusalem; but Faith and Hope, and the blessin\u0027 o\u0027 God\u0027ll accomplish wonders. If I kin only hold the souls in them boys\u0027 bodies till I kin git \u0027em back to Bean Blossom Crick, I\u0027ll trust Mother Klegg\u0027s nursin\u0027 to do the rest. If there ever was a woman who could stand off the Destroyin\u0027 Angel by good nursin\u0027 that woman\u0027s Mother Klegg, bless her soul.\" The next morning he was up betimes, and cooked the boys as good a breakfast as he could out of the remainder of his store and what he could get from the hospital, and then gave what was left to whoever came. The comfortable crib, which had cost the Deacon so much labor, had been pre-empted by the Surgeon for some of his weakest patients. The news had reached the 200th Ind. that the boys were going home, and they came over in a body to say \"Good-by.\" The sight of them pained the Deacon\u0027s good heart. Instead of the hundreds of well-fed, well-clothed, comfortable-looking young men he had seen at Murfreesboro a few months before, he now saw a shrunken band of gaunt, unkempt men, their clothing ragged and patched, many of them almost shoeless, many of them with pieces of blankets bound around their feet instead of shoes, many of them with bandages about their still unhealed wounds, but still keeping their places bravely with their comrades, and stubbornly refusing to count themselves among the sick and disabled, though it required all their will-power to do their share of the duty. But all of them were brimming over with unconquerable cheerfulness and pluck. They made light of their wounds and disabilities, jested at one another\u0027s ragged clothes, laughed at their hunger, teased one another about stealing corn from mules, jeered at the rebel shells from Lookout Mountain, yelled derisively at the rebel pickets across the creek, and promised them to soon come out and run Bragg\u0027s army off the face of the earth. All were eager to do something toward the comfort of their departing comrades. They scanned the arrangement of the boughs in the wagon with critical eyes, and picked them over and rearranged them, so as to avoid every chance of uncomfortable knots and lumps. They contributed blankets from their own scanty supply, to make sure that there would be plenty, and so many were eager to help carry Si out and put him in the wagon, that the Orderly-Sergeant of Co. Q had to take charge of the matter and make a detail. The teamster was given strong admonitions as to careful driving, and fearful warning as to what would happen to him in case of an accident. \"Hain\u0027t anything to send back home with you, boys, this time, but our love,\" said one of them. \"That\u0027s the only thing that\u0027s safe now-a-days from bein\u0027 stole, because no one kin eat or wear it. Tell the folks to pay no attention to what the paper says. No danger o\u0027 bein\u0027 run out o\u0027 Chattanoogy. Tell \u0027em that we\u0027re all fat, ragged and sassy, and only waitin\u0027 the word from Gen. Rosecrans to fall on old Bragg like a thousand o\u0027 brick and mash the lights outen him.\" \"Yes,\" joined another, \"tell \u0027em we\u0027ve got plenty to eat, sich as it is, and good enough, what there is of it. Don\u0027t worry about us. We\u0027re only blowin\u0027 up our muscle to git a good lick at old Bragg.\" \"Your muscle,\" said Shorty, satirically. \"You\u0027ve got about as much muscle now as a musketo. But you\u0027re good stuff all the same, and you\u0027re goin\u0027 to everlastingly lick the rebels when the time comes. I only wisht I was here to help you do it. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll go any further than Nashville. I\u0027ll be well enough to come back by that time. I\u0027ll see Si and his father off safely, and then gether up a crowd of other convalescents, and come back and clean the rebels off your cracker line.\" \"Good-by, boys,\" piped out Si. \"I\u0027ll be back soon. Don\u0027t bring on the big battle till I do. I want to help. Just skirmish around and push the rebels back into the woods while I\u0027m gone, and hive \u0027em up for a good lickin\u0027 by the time I git back.\" As the wagon moved off the 200th Ind. gave three cheers, and the regimental soloist struck up the \"Battle Cry of Freedom,\" in which they all joined with so much energy as to attract the attention of the rebel artillerist on Lookout Mountain, who favored them with a shell intended for their express benefit. It was no better directed than any of its many predecessors had been, and was greeted with yells of derision, in which all the camp joined. Having done all possible for the boys\u0027 comfort, the Deacon had lighted his pipe and taken his seat on a board laid over the front, where he could oversee the road and the teamster, and take a parting look at the animated scenery. The wagon pulled into the line of those moving out toward Bridgeport, and jogged along slowly for some hours until it was nearing the top of one of the hills that jutted out close to the Tennessee River, at the base of Lookout Mountain. The Deacon saw, with a little nervousness, that they were approaching the open space in which he had had his experience with the horse and buckboard, and he anxiously scanned the Craven House slope for signs of a rebel cannon. He saw that his apprehensions were shared by the drivers of the three or four teams just ahead. They were whipping up, and yelling at their teams to get past the danger point as quick as possible. The Deacon Reconnoitered the Situation 62 They had need of anxiety. A scattering volley of shots came from the bushes and the rocks on the opposite side of the Tennessee River and one of the leaders in the team just ahead of him dropped dead in his tracks. The teams in front were whipped up still harder, and succeeded in getting away. The shots were answered from a line of our own men on this side of the river, who fired at the smoke they saw rising. The Deacon\u0027s own teamster sprang from his saddle, and prudently got in the shelter of the wagon until the affair would be over. The teamster next ahead ran forward, and began cutting the fallen mule loose, but while he was doing so another shot laid the other mule low. The teamster fell fiat on the ground, and lay there for a minute. Then he cautiously arose, and began cutting that mule loose, when a shot struck the near-swing mule in the head, and he dropped. The Deacon kept that solid old head of his throughout the commotion, and surveyed the scene with cool observance. \"There\u0027s one feller somewhere over there doin\u0027 all that devilment,\" he said to Shorty, who was pushing his head eagerly out of the front of the wagon to find out what was going on. \"He\u0027s a sharpshooter from way back. You kin see he\u0027s droppin\u0027 them mules jest about as fast as he kin load his gun. Them other fellers over there are jest putterin\u0027 away, makin\u0027 a noise. You kin see their shots strikin\u0027 down the hill there, and everywhere, where they ain\u0027t doin\u0027 nothin\u0027. But that feller\u0027s out for business. I\u0027ve bin tryin\u0027 to locate him. He\u0027s somewhere closter than any o\u0027 the others. Their bullets don\u0027t quite reach, while his goes home every time. See there.\" The off-swing mule dropped this time. \"Land\u0027s sakes,\" ejaculated the Deacon, \"he\u0027s costin\u0027 Uncle Sam $150 every time his gun cracks. It\u0027s jest sinful to be destroyin\u0027 property that way. Shorty, kin you reach me that gun o\u0027 Si\u0027s out o\u0027 the wagon? I believe I\u0027ll slip down toward the bank and see if I can\u0027t find that feller. I\u0027ve bin watchin\u0027 the willers along the aidge o\u0027 the water, and I believe he\u0027s in there.\" \"Don\u0027t go, Pap,\" pleaded Si. \"Some of the boys on the skirmish-line \u0027ll find him soon, and settle him. Don\u0027t expose yourself. Stay behind the wagon.\" \"Yes, stay back under cover, Deacon,\" joined in Shorty. \"Let the boys down there \u0027tend to him. They\u0027re gittin\u0027 $16 a month for it, and don\u0027t want nobody else to interfere in their job.\" Just then the near wheel mule dropped. \"Gi\u0027 me that gun at onct,\" said the Deacon sternly. Shorty handed him the Springfield and its cartridge-box without another word. The Deacon looked over the rifle, \"hefted\" it, and tried it at his shoulder to get its poise, critically examined its sights by aiming at various objects, and then wiped out its barrel, as he would that of his trusty hunting-rifle at home. All of his old deer-hunting instincts revived. He took out several cartridges, turned them over in his hand, and carefully selected one, tore open the paper, poured the powder in, removed the paper from the ball, and carefully rammed it home, struck the butt of the gun on the ground to make sure of its priming, and put on the cap. \"Hold her about a foot under. Pap, at 400 yards,\" said Si, who had rolled over to the side of the wagon, and was watching him from under the cover, which was raised up a little. \"Put your sights up to the 400 mark, and then draw the top o\u0027 the bead down fine into that notch, and she\u0027ll put it right where you hold her.\" By this time the sharpshooter had finished up the mules on the team ahead, and begun on that of the Deacon. The firing was furious all along both sides of the river, and the teamsters in the rear were showing signs of stampeding. The Wagonmaster was storming up and down to hold them in place, and the officers in command of the line along the river bank were raging at their men for not suppressing the fire from over the stream. \"Old man, you\u0027d better not go down there,\" said a Captain as the Deacon came walking down, looking very grim and determined. \"It\u0027s getting hotter down there every minute. The rebels seem determined to stick to their work, and I\u0027ve had three men wounded already.\" \"Look out for your own men, my son,\" answered the Deacon, in whom the fire of battle was burning. \"I\u0027ll look out for myself. If I\u0027m hit the Gover\u0027ment won\u0027t lose nothin\u0027. I\u0027m only a citizen.\" He had kept his eye on the clump of willows, and was sure that his man was in there, though the smoke hung around so confusingly that he could not always make out where a fresh shot came from. He got down to where an occasional bullet struck in his neighborhood, but that did not disturb him. He began to feel that thrill of man-hunting which when it seizes a man is an overpowering passion. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to stop him killin\u0027 mules,\" he said to himself. \"I rayly hope I won\u0027t kill him, but that\u0027s a secondary matter. Providence\u0027ll settle that. It\u0027s my duty to stop him. That\u0027s clear. If his time\u0027s come Providence\u0027ll put the bullet where it\u0027ll kill him. If it ain\u0027t, it won\u0027t. That\u0027s all. Providence indicates my duty to me. The responsibility for the rest is with Providence, who doeth all things well.\" He reached the firing-line, strung along the ragged bluffs, and hiding behind trees, stumps and stones. \"Lay down, there, old man; grab a root; keep under cover, or you\u0027ll git hit,\" some of them called out to him, noticing him as they turned to load. \"The air is so full o\u0027 bullets you kin ketch your hat full if you only hold it up.\" \"All right, boys, I\u0027ll lay low. I\u0027ve come down here to help you,\" answered the Deacon. \"Bully for you; we need it.\" The Deacon took his position behind a big black walnut, while he reconnoitered the situation, and got his bearings on the clump of willows. He felt surer than ever of his man, for he actually saw a puff of smoke come from it, and saw that right behind the puff stood a willow that had grown to the proportions of a small tree, and had its bark rubbed off by the chafing of driftwood against it. \"He\u0027s right behind that peeled wilier,\" the Deacon said, \"and takes a rest agin it. Three inches to the left o\u0027 that, and three foot from the ground\u0027ll take him square in the breast, as he is probably kneeling down.\" Before him he noticed a deep gully cut in the bank, by which he could get down to the water\u0027s edge where there was a clump of paw-paws projecting out toward the willows. If he went down there it would make his shot surer, but there was much danger that he would be noticed and fired at on his way. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 down there,\" he said, after a moment\u0027s deliberation. \"Providence has sent me on this job, and intends I shall do it right, which I kin by goin\u0027 down there. Providence\u0027ll take care o\u0027 me while I\u0027m goin\u0027. Same time, Providence expects me to show gumption, by not exposin\u0027 myself any more\u0027n possible.\" Therefore he cut a young, thick-branched cedar and held it in front of him as he crouched and made his way to the gully and down it. He had nearly reached the cover of the paw-paws, and was beginning to congratulate himself that his cedar screen and the turmoil on the bank above had enabled him to escape attention, when a bullet struck a stone to his left, and threw it against him with such force as to almost knock all the breath out of his body. He fell to the ground, but retained coolness enough to understand that this was to his advantage, and he crawled slowly forward until he was safely behind the bushes. \"That come from that hound in the willers,\" said he to himself. \"He\u0027s a sharp one. He got on to me somehow, and now it\u0027s me and him fur it. Anyhow, he didn\u0027t kill a mule worth $150 with that bullet. But it\u0027ll take as much as six bits\u0027 worth o\u0027 porous plaster to take the swellin\u0027 out o\u0027 my side where that rock welted me.\" He hitched forward cautiously a little farther, to where he could peer through the bushes, being exceedingly wary not to repeat his opponent\u0027s mistake, and set their tops in motion. A rock protruding through the ground in front of him made an opening through which he could see, and also afforded a rest for his musket. He looked sharply, and at length was rewarded by seeing the gun-barrel come out by the side of the barked willow, rested on a bare limb, and apparently aimed at the hill beyond. He took a long breath to steady his nerves, stretched out his legs to make himself more at ease, pushed his musket forward until he got exactly the right poise, aimed about nine inches below the level of his opponent\u0027s gun-barrel, and a little to the left, drew his bead down to a hair\u0027s nicety in the hind sight, and pulled the trigger just as the rebel sharpshooter did the same. Both muskets seemed to flash at the same moment. The rebel sprang up through the willows and fell forward on his face. The Deacon picked up his gun and walked back up the bank. The union skirmishers had seen the man fall and raised a yell, which they changed to cheers as they saw the Deacon coming up the bank. The Captain in command came up and said: \"Sir, I congratulate you. That was splendidly done. I was just getting on to that fellow when you went down. I watched you through my glass, and saw you fetch him. You are entitled to all our thanks.\" \"No thanks to me, sir. I only done the dooty Providence marked out for me. I hope the man ain\u0027t killed. If he is, it\u0027s because Providence had fixed the number of his days. I only wanted to stop his killin\u0027 mules, and destroyin\u0027 Gover\u0027ment property, and let us go on our journey in peace.\" \"Well, I wish you\u0027d stay here and help us with some more of those fellows over there. I\u0027m sure their time has come, but my men don\u0027t seem to be quite as good in carrying out the decrees of Providence as you are.\" \"Thankee, sir,\" said the Deacon. \"But I must go back and \u0027tend to my boys. We\u0027ve got a long ways to go yet to-day.\" He went back to the road and reported to the Wagonmaster: \"Now you kin clear away them dead mules and go ahead. You won\u0027t scarcely be bothered any more for awhile at least.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63278.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
