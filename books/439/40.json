IN A NEW WORLD","content":"DEACON KLEGG HAS A LITTLE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE IN THE ARMY. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pap\" said Si, by way of introduction, \"this is Shorty, my pardner, and the best pardner a feller ever had, and the best soldier in the Army of the Cumberland.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Glad to see you, Mr. Klegg,\" said Shorty, reddening and grasping the father\u0027s outstretched hand; \"but you orter \u0027ve broke that boy o\u0027 your\u0027n o\u0027 lyin\u0027 when he was young.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He never did lie,\" said the Deacon cheerfully, \"and I don\u0027t believe he\u0027s lyin\u0027 now. I\u0027ve heard a great deal o\u0027 you, Mr. Shorty, and I\u0027m sure he\u0027s tellin\u0027 the truth about you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"drop the Mister, Pap,\" said Si. \"We never call each other Mister here, except when we\u0027re mad.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si took the carpetsack under his arm, and they trudged up toward Army Headquarters. \\n\\n \\n\\n Relieved of anxiety as to his own personal safety, and having found his son, Deacon Klegg viewed everything around him with open-eyed interest. It was a wonderfully new and strange world into which the sober, plodding Indiana farmer had dropped. The men around him spoke the speech to which his ears were accustomed, but otherwise they were as foreign as if they had come from the heart of China.193 \\n\\n \\n\\n Their dress, their manners, their actions, the ways in which they were busying themselves, had no resemblance to anything seen on the prosaic plains of the Wabash in his half-century of life there. The infantry sweeping over the fields in endless waves, the dashing cavalcades of officers and staffs, the bewildering whirl of light batteries dazed him. Even Si awed him. It was hard to recognize in the broad-shouldered, self-assured young soldier, who seemed so entirely at home in his startling surroundings, the blundering, bashful hobbledehoy boy of a few months before, whose feet and hands were constantly in the way, and into everything else that they should not be. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Somehow, Si,\" he said, looking at his offspring with contemplative eye, \"you seem to have growed like a cornstalk in July, and yit when I come to measure you you don\u0027t seem no taller nor heavier than when you went away. How is it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t know, Pap,\" Si answered. \"I feel as if I\u0027d had more\u0027n 10 long years o\u0027 growth since we crossed the Ohio River. Yit, you don\u0027t seem a minute older than when I went away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t feel no older,\" returned the father, \"until I got in that guard-house last night. Then I could feel my hair gittin\u0027 grayer every hour, and my teeth droppin\u0027 out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid you didn\u0027t git much chance to sleep, Pap,\" said Si sympathetically. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Loss o\u0027 sleep was the least part of it,\" said the Deacon feelingly. \"I kin stand a little loss o\u0027 sleep without any partickler bother. It wasn\u0027t bein\u0027 kept awake so much as the way I was kept awake that bore on me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, what happened?\" asked Si. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Better ask what didn\u0027t happen,\" groaned his father. \"Used to have some mighty rough shivarees when I was a boy, and\u0027d jest settled on the Wabash. Lots o\u0027 toughs then, \u0027specially \u0027mong the flatboat-men, who\u0027d nothin\u0027 to drink but new sod-cornwhisky, that\u0027d fight in every spoonful. But for sure, straight-out tumultuousness that guard-house last night gave six pecks for every bushel of a Wabash shivaree.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty looked meaningly at Si. \"Guard-house fellers\u0027s likely to be a ructionary lot o\u0027 roosters. Awful sorry you got in among \u0027em. Was they very bad?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I should say. When I was chucked in they wuz havin\u0027 a regular prize fight, \u0027cordin\u0027 to rules, as to whether Rousseau or Negley wuz the best General. The Rousseau man got licked, and then the other Rousseau men wuzzent satisfied, and proposed to lick all the Negley men in the guard-house; but the Sheridan men interfered, and made the Rousseau men cool down. They they turned their attention to me. They raised a row about a citizen being put in among them. It was a disgrace. The guard house was only intended for soldiers and gentlemen, and no place for condemned civilians. Then some one said that I had been arrested as a Knight o\u0027 the Golden Circle, on my way to Bragg, with information from the Injianny Knights. Another insisted that he knowed me, and that I wuz Vallandigham himself, brought down there to be sent through the lines. Then I thought sure they\u0027d kill me on the spot. I begged and pled and denied. Finally, they organized a court-martial to try me for my life.194 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They had an awful tonguey feller that acted as Prosecutin\u0027 Attorney, and the way he blackguarded me was a shame. He said the word \u0027traitor\u0027 was wrote in every liniment o\u0027 my face; that I wuz a dyed-in-the-wool butternut, and that the bag I\u0027d brung along with me contained the muster-rolls of 100,000 Injiannians who\u0027d bin swore in to fight for Jeff Davis. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The feller that they appinted to defend me admitted the truth of all that the other feller\u0027d said. He said that no one could look in my Southern Injianny face without seem\u0027 Secession, treason and nigger-lovin\u0027 wrote there in big letters. He could only ask the honorable court for mercy instid o\u0027 justice, and that I be shot instid o\u0027 hung, as I deserved. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When they asked me what I\u0027d got to say in my own defense I told \u0027em the truth, and said that I\u0027d come down here to visit my son, who they all knowed they must know Si Klegg. o\u0027 the 200th Injianny Volunteers, who was an officer, and had a house with a tin roof. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then they all got up and yelled. They said they knowed Si Klegg only too well; that he wuz the meanest, oneriest soljer in the army, and that he looked just like me. They had him in the guard house now. He\u0027d bin put in for stealin\u0027 a hoe-cake from a blind nigger half-way back to Nashville durin\u0027 the battle. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They brought up the dirtiest, scaliest lookin\u0027 man in the guard-house, and said that was Si Klegg, and that he resembled me so much that they wuz sure he wuz my son. They asked him if he reckernized me as his dad, and after they kicked him two195 or three times he said he did, but he wuz goin\u0027 to cut his throat now, since they\u0027d found it out. He couldn\u0027t stand everything. Then they said they\u0027d postpone execution on condition that I\u0027d kneel down, drink a pint o\u0027 whisky, take the oath o\u0027 allegiance to Abe Lincoln, and sing \u0027We\u0027ll hang Jeff Davis on a sour-apple tree.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I told \u0027em I wuz perfectly willin\u0027 to take the oath to Abe Lincoln as often as they pleased; that he wuz my man from start to finish; that I wanted Jeff Davis hung the minit we ketched him. I\u0027d sing the song if they\u0027d learn it to me, though I\u0027ve not sung anything but hymns for the last 25 years. As for the whisky, I wouldn\u0027t tech it on no account, for I belonged to the Good Templars. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They all seemed pacified with this except one man, who insisted that I should drink the whisky. One o\u0027 the Sheridan men knocked him down, and then the fight between the Rousseau men and the Negley men broke out afresh, and the guard come in and quieted things. By the time they\u0027d done this they found that the man who had reckernized me as his father wuz tryin\u0027 to hang himself with a piece o\u0027 tent-rope. They cut him down, larruped him with the tent-rope, and then started another court to try me for havin\u0027 sich a son. But some officer come in and took out the Prosecutin\u0027 Attorney and the lawyer for the defense and the Presidin\u0027 Judge and bucked and gagged \u0027em. This cooled things down agin till mornin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His Honor and the \u0027attorney\u0027 Bucked And Gagged. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We might walk over to the Provost-Marshal\u0027s,\" suggested Shorty, \"and watch for them fellers as they come out, and take a drop out o\u0027 some of \u0027em.\"196 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027ll be a waste o\u0027 time,\" said Si, with a shrug of his shoulders. \"They\u0027ll all be doing hard labor for the next 30 days, and by that time we\u0027ll likely have a good deal else to think about. Let\u0027s report at Headquarters, and then take Dad over and show him our new house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I\u0027m dying to see it,\" said the Deacon, \"and197 to git somewhere that I kin sit down in peace and quietness. Seems to me I haven\u0027t had a moment\u0027s rest for years, and I\u0027m as nigh tuckered out as I ever wuz in my life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At the Army Headquarters was a crowd of officers, mounted and dismounted. Aids were arriving and departing, and there was a furore when some General commanding a corps or division came or went, which impressed the father greatly. Si and Shorty stood at \"attention,\" and respectfully saluted as the officers passed, and the Deacon tried awkwardly, but his best, to imitate their example. Two or three spruce young Orderlies attempted to guy him. but this thing came to a sudden stop when Shorty took one of them quietly by the ear, and said in a low voice: \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty Admonishes the Orderly 198 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be brash, bub. If you only knowed it, you\u0027re givin\u0027 your measure for a first-class, custom-made lickin\u0027, and I\u0027m the artist to do the job. That old man\u0027s my chum\u0027s father, and I won\u0027t allow no funny business \u0027round where I am.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We wuz ordered to report to Gen. Rosecrans,\" said Si to the Orderly on duty before the tent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are you to report for?\" asked a member of the staff, standing near. \"The General is very busy now, and can see no one. Who ordered you to report?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The General himself,\" said Si. \\n\\n \\n\\n The sound of his voice reached Gen. Rosecrans, in side, and busy as he was, arrested his attention. With the kindly thoughtfulness that so endeared him to his soldiers he instantly remembered his promise, dropped his pen, and came to the door.198 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ordered these men to report,\" he said to the Aid. \"Bring me that checker-board which lies on my table.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Aid did so. Gen. Rosecrans noticed the father, and, as usual, saw the opportunity of doing a kindly, gracious thing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You have found your son, I see,\" he said to him. \"Sorry that you had so much trouble. That\u0027s a fine son you have. One of the very best soldiers in199 my army. I congratulate you upon him. Boys, here is your board and men. I may drop in some evening and see you play a game. I\u0027ll be careful to clean my feet, this time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si and Shorty got very red in the face at this allusion, and began to stammer excuses. The General playfully pinched Si\u0027s ear and said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go to your quarters now, you young rascal, and take your father with you. I hope he\u0027ll have a very pleasant time while he is in camp.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They saluted and turned away too full for utterance. After they had gone a little distance the Deacon remarked, as if communing with himself: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And that is Gen. Rosecrans. Awful nice man. Nicest man I ever saw. Greatest General in the world. Won\u0027t this be something to tell Mariar and the girls. And the men down at the store. I\u0027d \u0027ve come down here 40 times jest to \u0027ve seen him and talked with him. What\u0027d last night in the guard house amount to, after all? A man must expect some trouble occasionally. Wouldn\u0027t have no fun if he didn\u0027t. Say, Si, remember Old Susy\u0027s chestnut colt?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" answered Si. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I thought he had in him the makin\u0027 o\u0027 the finest horse in Posey County.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Si. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, he\u0027s turnin\u0027 out even better\u0027n I thought he would. Shouldn\u0027t wonder if he could trot down somewhere nigh 2:40.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t say so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, indeed. You used to want that colt mighty bad, Si.\"200 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I remember that I did, Pap.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Si, I\u0027ll give you that colt, and take good care o\u0027 him till you come home, for that \u0027ere checker board.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When they arrived at their house Si and Shorty arranged the things so as to give the Deacon a most comfortable rest after his trying experiences, and cooked him the best dinner their larder would afford. After dinner they filled him a pipe-full of kinni-kinnick, and the old gentleman sat down to enjoy201 it while Si and Shorty investigated the contents of the carpetsack. They found endless fun in its woeful condition. The butter and honey were smeared over everything, in the rough handling which it had endured. They pulled out the shirt, the socks, the boots, the paper and books, and scraped off carefully as much as they could of the precious honey and butter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s too good to waste the least bit,\" said Shorty, tasting it from time to time with unction. \"Don\u0027t mind a hair or two in the butter, this time, Si. I kin believe your mother is a good buttermaker. It\u0027s the best I ever tasted.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, the butter and the honey may be spiled,\" said Si, \"but the other things are all right. My, ain\u0027t this a nice shirt. And them socks. Shorty, did you ever see such socks. Ever so much obliged to you, Pap, for these boots. Old Hank Sommers\u0027s make. He\u0027s the best shoemaker in the State of Injianny. No Quartermaster\u0027s cowhide about them. And—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si stopped. He had suddenly come across Anna bel\u0027s ambrotype. He tried to slip it into his pocket without the others seeing him. He edged awkwardly to the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You look over the rest o\u0027 the things, Shorty,\" he said, with a blush that hid his freckles. \"I\u0027ve got to go down and see the Orderly-Sergeant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty and the Deacon exchanged very profound winks. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63227.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
