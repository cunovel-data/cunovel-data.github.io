{"id":45089,"no":54,"title":"CHAPTER VII. CORN PONE AND BUTTERMILK","content":"SI AND SHORTY GO FORAGING AND ARE CAPTURED AND ROBBED SI AND SHORTY got the common feeling of men of some months\u0027 service, that they had fully mastered the art of war, and that there was little, if anything, left for them to learn. It did not take some men even so long as months to acquire this pleasant idea of themselves. Some entered the army feeling quite capable of giving advice to the oldest General in it, and they were not slow about offering their opinions. Si and Shorty had had successes enough since their enlistment to develop a self-confidence which might be pardoned if it expanded into self-sufficiency and vanity. The 200th Ind. had been sent out on a reconnoissance toward Shelbyville. No sign of rebels in force developed in any direction, and Si and Shorty got permission to go off on a little scout of their own. \"No use o\u0027 huntin\u0027 rebels with a brass band,\" said Si, who, since his association with Mr. Rosenbaum, had gotten some idea that stealth and cunning were efficient war powers. \"We kin jest slip around out here somewhere, and if there is any rebels, find \u0027em, and git more information than the whole regiment kin.\" \"I\u0027m not so thirsty for information and rebels95 as I am for some fresh buttermilk,\" said Shorty. \"Somehow, I\u0027ve been hankering for buttermilk and cornpone for days. I hain\u0027t had any for a coon\u0027s age, and it\u0027d go mighty good as a change from camp rations. Buttermilk and rebels sometimes grow near together. You look for one, I\u0027ll look for the other. Mebbe we kin git both.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t mind havin\u0027 some buttermilk an\u0027 cornpone myself,\" said Si. \"But I\u0027d like much better to drop on some rebels somewhere, and bring \u0027em into camp, and show that we kin git more information than the whole regiment kin.\" \"All right,\" assented Shorty; \"ask the Captain to let us go. I\u0027ll be bound we\u0027ll find something worth goin\u0027 for, if it\u0027s no more\u0027n a chicken for the Captain\u0027s supper. I\u0027d like to take in one for him. He\u0027s been mighty good to me and you in several ways, and I\u0027d like to show him that we appreciate it.\" As the regiment had gone as far as ordered without discovering anything that in the least threatened the peace in that portion of Tennessee, it would start on its return, after the men had rested and had dinner. Si and Shorty, consequently, had no difficulty in securing the desired permission. They cut off through a side-road, which gave promise of leading into a better-settled part of the country than that they had been traversing. A mile or so of walking brought them in sight of the substantial chimneys of a farmhouse showing above the trees. A glimpse of a well-fenced field roused warm hopes in Shorty\u0027s heart. \"Now, I think we\u0027re comin\u0027 to a better thing than we\u0027ve ever struck before,\" said he, as they stopped96 and surveyed the prospect. \"We\u0027ve got out o\u0027 the barren plateaus and into the rich farming country. That\u0027s likely a farm jest like they have up in Injianny, and it\u0027s way off where they hain\u0027t knowed nothin\u0027 o\u0027 the war. No soljer\u0027s ever anigh \u0027em, and they\u0027ve jest got lots and plenty o\u0027 everything. They\u0027ve got a great big barnyard full o\u0027 chickens and turkeys, pigs and geese and guineas. There, you kin hear the guineas hollerin\u0027 now. There\u0027s cows layin\u0027 in the shade chawin\u0027 the cud, while their calves are cavortin\u0027 around in the sun, hogs rootin\u0027 in the woods-pasture, horses and sheep in the medder, and everything like it is at home. And down a little ways from the house there\u0027s a cool springhouse, with clear, cold water wellin\u0027 up and ripplin\u0027 out over the clean, white sand, with crocks o\u0027 fresh milk setting in it with cream half an inch thick, and big jars o\u0027 buttermilk from the last churnin\u0027, and piggins o\u0027 fresh butter, and mebbe a big crock full o\u0027 smearkase. Si, do you like smearkase?\" \"\u0027Deed I do,\" answered Si, his mouth watering at the thought. \"My goodness, you jest orter eat some o\u0027 mother\u0027s smearkase. She jest lays over all the women in the country for smearkase. Many\u0027s the time I\u0027ve come in hot and sweatin from the field, and got a thick slice o\u0027 bread clear acrost the loaf from one o\u0027 the girls, and went down to our spring-house and spread it with fresh butter, and then put a thick layer o\u0027 smearkase on top o\u0027 that, and then got about a quart o\u0027 cool milk, that was half cream, from ono o\u0027 the crocks, and then—\" \"Shot up, Si,\" shouted Shorty, desperately. \"Do you want me to bang you over the head with my97 musket? Do you s\u0027pose I kin stand everything? But I believe there\u0027s jest sich a spring-house down there, and we\u0027ll find it plumb-full o\u0027 all them sort o\u0027 things. Le\u0027s mosey on.\" \"Do you think there\u0027s any rebels around here?\" said Si, the caution which experience had taught him making a temporary reassertion of itself. \"Naw,\" said Shorty, contemtpuously, \"there ain\u0027t no rebel this side o\u0027 the Duck River, unless some straggler, who\u0027d run if he saw us. If we ketch sight o\u0027 one we\u0027ll take him into camp, jest to gratify you. But I ain\u0027t lookin\u0027 for none. Buttermilk and cornpone\u0027s what I want.\" The scene was certainly peaceful enough to justify Shorty\u0027s confidence. A calmer, quieter landscape could not have been found in the whole country. A negro was plowing in a distant field, with occasional sonorous yells to his team. He did not seem to notice the soldiers, nor did a gray-haired white man who was sitting on the fence superintending him. A couple of negresses were washing the family linen by a fire under a large kettle on the creek bank, at some distance from the house, and spreading the cleansed garments out on the grass to dry and bleach. Cattle and horses were feeding on the fresh Spring grass and sheep browsing on the bushes on the hillside. Hens cackled and roosters crowed; the guineas, ever on the lookout, announced their approach with shrill, crackling notes. Two or three dogs waked up and barked lazily at them as they walked up the path to where an elderly, spectacled woman sat on the porch knitting. She raised98 her eyes and threw her spectacles on top of her head, and looked curiously at them. Whatever faint misgivings Si might have had vanished at the utter peacefulness of the scene. It was so like the old home that he had left that he could not imagine that war existed anywhere near. It seemed as if the camp at Murfreesboro\u0027 and the bloody field of Stone River must be a thousand miles away. The beds of roses and pinks which bordered the walk were the same as decorated the front yard at home. There were the same clumps of snowballs and lilacs at the corners of the house. \"Howdy, gentlemen?\" said the woman, as they came up. It seemed almost a wrong and insult to be carrying deadly arms in the presence of such a woman, and Si and Shorty let their guns slip down, as if they were rather ashamed of them. \"Good day, ma\u0027am,\" said Shorty, taking off his hat politely and wiping his face. \"We\u0027re lookin\u0027 around to git some cornpone and buttermilk, and didn\u0027t know but what you might let us have some. We\u0027re willin\u0027 to pay for it.\" \"If you want suthin\u0027 to eat,\" said the woman promptly, \"I kin gin it to ye. I never turn no hungry man away from my door. Wait a minnit and I\u0027ll bring ye some.\" She disappeared inside the house, and Si remarked to Shorty: \"Your head\u0027s level this time, as it generally is. We\u0027ll git something that\u0027s worth while comin\u0027 after.\" The woman reappeared with a couple of good-size corn-dodgers in her hand.99 \"This appears to be all the bread that\u0027s left over from dinner,\" she said. \"And the meat\u0027s all gone. But the wenches \u0027ll be through their washin\u0027 purty soon, and then I\u0027ll have them cook ye some more, if ye\u0027ll wait.\" \"Thankee, ma\u0027am,\" said Shorty; \"we can\u0027t wait. This\u0027ll be a plenty, if we kin only git some buttermilk to go with it. We don\u0027t want no meat. We git plenty o\u0027 that in camp.\" \"You can have all the buttermilk you want to drink,\" she answered, \"if you\u0027ll go down to the spring-house thar and git it. It\u0027s fresh, and you\u0027ll find a gourd right beside o\u0027 the jar. I\u0027d go with you, but it allers gives me rheumatiz to go nigh the spring-house.\" \"Don\u0027t bother, ma\u0027am, to go with us,\" said Shorty politely. \"We are very much obliged to you, indeed, and we kin make out by ourselves. How much do we owe you?\" And he pulled a greenback dollar from his pocket. \"Nothin\u0027, nothin\u0027 at all,\" said the woman hastily. \"I don\u0027t sell vittels. Never thought o\u0027 sich a thing. Ye\u0027re welcome to all ye kin eat any time.\" \"Well, take the money, and let us ketch a couple of them chickens there,\" said Shorty, laying down the bill on the banister rail. After a little demur the woman finally agreed to this, and picked up the money. The boys selected two fat chickens, ran them down, wrung their necks, and, after repeating their thanks, took their bread and started for the spring-house. They found it the coolest and most inviting place in the world on a hot, tiresome day—just such a spot as Shorty had100 described. It was built of rough stones, and covered with a moss-grown roof. A copious spring poured out a flood of clear, cool water, which flowed over white pebbles and clean-looking sand until it formed a cress-bordered rivulet just beyond the house. In the water sat crocks of fresh milk, a large jar of buttermilk, and buckets of butter. The looks, the cool, pure freshness of the place, were delightful101 contrasts from the tiresome smells and appearances of the camp kitchens. The boys reveled in the change. They forgot all about war\u0027s alarms, stood their rifles up against the side of the spring-house, washed their dust-grimed faces and hands in the pure water, dried them with their handkerchiefs, and prepared to enjoy their meal. How good the buttermilk tasted along with the cornpone. The fresh milk was also sampled, and some of the butter spread upon their bread. Si even went to the point of declaring that it was almost as good as the things he used to eat at home, which was the highest praise he could possibly give to any food. Si never found anywhere victuals or cooking to equal that of his mother. He was pointing out to Shorty, as they munched, the likenesses and unlikenesses of this spring-house to that on the Wabash, when they were startled by the stern command: \"Surrender, there, you infernal Yankees!\" Undesirable Acquaintances. 100 They looked up with startled eyes to stare into a dozen muskets leveled straight at their heads from the willow thickets. Corn-dodgers and milk-gourds dropped into the water as they impulsively jumped to their feet. \"If yo\u0027uns move we\u0027uns \u0027ll blow the lights outen yo\u0027uns,\" shouted the leader of the rebels. \"Hold up yer hands.\" It was a moment of the most intense anguish that either of them had ever known. Their thoughts were lightning-like in rapidity. The rebel muzzles were not a rod away, their aim was true, and it102 would be madness to risk their fire, for it meant certain death. The slightest move toward resistance was suicide. Si gave a deep groan, and up went his hands at the same moment with Shorty\u0027s. The rebels rushed out of the clump of willows behind which they had crept up on the boys, and surrounded them. Two snatched up their guns, and the others began pulling off their haversacks and other personal property as their own shares of the booty. In the midst of this, Si looked around, and saw the woman standing near calmly knitting. \"You ain\u0027t so afeared o\u0027 rheumatism all at once,\" he said bitterly. \"My rheumatiz has spells, young man, same ez other people\u0027s,\" she answered, pulling one of the needles out, and counting the stitches with it. \"Sometimes it is better, and sometimes it is wuss. Jest now it is a great deal better, thankee. I only wisht I could toll the whole Yankee army to destruction ez easy ez you wuz. My, but ye walked right in, like the fly to the spider. I never had nothin\u0027 do my rheumatiz so much good.\" And she cackled with delight. \"When you git through,\" she continued, addressing the leader of the rebels, \"come up to the house, and I\u0027ll have some dinner cooked for ye. I know ye\u0027re powerful tired an\u0027 hungry. I s\u0027pose nothin\u0027 need be cooked for them,\" and she pointed her knitting-needle contemptuously at Si and Shorty. \"Ole Satan will be purvidin\u0027 fur them. I\u0027ll take these along to cook fur ye.\"103 She gathered up the dead chickens and stalked back to the house. \"Ef we\u0027re gwine t\u0027 shoot they\u0027uns le\u0027s take they\u0027uns over thar on the knoll, whar they\u0027uns won\u0027t spile nothin\u0027,\" said one evil-looking man, who had just ransacked Si\u0027s pockets and appropriated everything in them. \"Hit\u0027d be too bad t\u0027 kill they\u0027uns here right in sight o\u0027 the house.\" \"Le\u0027me see them letters, Bushrod;\" said the leader, snatching a package of letters and Annabel\u0027s picture out of the other\u0027s hand. \"Mebbe thar\u0027s some news in them that the Captain\u0027d like to have.\" Si gnashed his teeth as he saw the cherished missives rudely torn open and scanned, and especially when the ambrotype case was opened and Annabel\u0027s features made the subject of coarse comment. The imminent prospect of being murdered had a much lighter pang. While the letters and ambrotype were being looked over the process of robbery was going on. One had snatched Si\u0027s cap, another had pulled off his blouse, and there was a struggle as to who should have possession of his new Government shoes, which were regarded as a great prize. Si had resisted this spoliation, but was caught from behind and held, despite his kicks and struggles, while the shoes were pulled off. Shorty was treated in the same way. The Spoils of War 105 In a few minutes both, exhausted by their vigorous resistance, were seated on the ground, with nothing left on them but their pantaloons, while their captors were quarreling over the division of their personal effects, and as to what disposition was to be made of them. In the course of the discussion104 the boys learned that they had been captured by a squad of young men from the immediate neighborhood, who had been allowed to go home on furlough, had been gathered together when the regiment appeared, and had been watching every movement from safe coverts. They had seen Si and Shorty leave, and had carefully dogged their steps until such moment as they could pounce on them. \"Smart as we thought we wuz,\" said Si bitterly, \"we played right into their hands. They tracked us down jest as if we\u0027d bin a couple o\u0027 rabbits, and ketched us jest when they wanted us.\" He gave a groan which Shorty echoed. Bushrod and two others were for killing the two boys then and there and ending the matter. \"They orter be killed, Ike, right here,\" said Bushrod to the leader. \"They deserve it, and we\u0027uns hain\u0027t got no time to fool. We\u0027uns can\u0027t take they\u0027uns back with we\u0027uns, ef we wanted to, and I for one don\u0027t want to. I\u0027d ez soon have a rattlesnake around me.\" But Ike, the leader, was farther-seeing. He represented to the others the vengeance the Yankees would take on the people of the neighborhood if they murdered the soldiers. This developed another party, who favored taking the prisoners to some distance and killing them there, so as to avoid the contingency that Ike had set forth. Then there were propositions to deliver them over to the guerrilla leaders, to be disposed of as they pleased. Finally, it occurred to Ike that they were talking entirely too freely before the prisoners, unless they105 intended to kill them outright, for they were giving information in regard to the position and operations of rebel bands that might prove dangerous. He drew his squad off a little distance to continue the discussion. At first they kept their eyes on the prisoners and their guns ready to fire, but as they talked they lost their watchful attitude in the eagerness of making their points. Si looked at Shorty, and caught an answering gleam. Like a flash both were on their feet and started on a mad rush for the fence. Bushrod saw106 them start, and fired. His bullet cut off a lock of Si\u0027s auburn hair. Others fired as fast as they could bring their guns up, and the bullets sang viciously around, but none touched the fugitives. Their bare feet were torn by the briars as they ran, but they thought not of these. They plunged into the blackberry briars along the fence, climbed it, and gained the road some distance ahead of their pursuers, who were not impelled by the fear of immediate death to spur them on. Up the road went Si and Shorty with all the speed that will-power could infuse into their legs. Some of the rebels stopped to reload; the others ran after. A score of noisy dogs suddenly waked up and joined in the pursuit. The old white man mounted his horse and came galloping toward the house. On the boys ran, gaining, if anything, upon the foremost of the rebels. The dogs came nearer, but before they could do any harm the boys halted for an instant and poured such a volley of stones into them that they ran back lamed and yelping. The fleetest-footed of the rebels, who was the sanguinary Bushrod, also came within a stone\u0027s throw, and received a well-aimed bowlder from Si\u0027s muscular hand full in his face. This cheered the boys so that they ran ahead with increased speed, and finally gained the top of the hill from which they had first seen the farmhouse. They looked back and saw their enemies still after them. Ike had taken the old man\u0027s horse and was coming on a gallop. They knew he had a revolver, and shivered at the thought. But both stooped and selected the best stones to throw, to attack him with107 as soon as he came within range. They halted a minute to get their breath and nerve for the good effort. Ike had reached a steep, difficult part of the road, where his horse had to come down to a walk and pick his way. An Uncomfortable Situation 107 \"Now, Si,\" said Shorty, \"throw for your life, if you never did before. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to git him. You take his horse\u0027s head. Aim for that white blaze in his forehead.\" Si concentrated his energy into one supreme effort.108 He could always beat the rest of the boys in throwing stones, and now his practice was to save him. He flung the smooth, round pebble with terrific force, and it went true to its mark. The horse reared with his rider just at the instant that a bowlder from Shorty\u0027s hand landed on Ike\u0027s breast. The rebel fell to the ground, and the boys ran on. At the top of the next hill they saw the regiment marching leisurely along at the foot of the hill. It was so unexpected a deliverance that it startled them. It seemed so long since they had left the regiment that it might have been clear back to Nashville. They yelled with all their remaining strength, and tore down the hill. Co. Q saw them at once, and at the command of the Captain came forward at the double-quick. The rebels had in the meanwhile gained the top of the hill. A few shots were fired at them as they turned from the chase. The Colonel rode back and questioned the boys. Then he turned to the Captain of Co. Q and said: \"Captain, take your company over to that house. If you find anything that you think we need in camp, bring it back with you. Put these boys in the ambulance.\" The exhausted Si and Shorty were helped into the ambulance, the Surgeon gave them a reviving drink of whisky and quinine, and as they stretched themselves out on the cushioned seats Si remarked: \"Shorty, we ain\u0027t ez purty ez we used to be, but we know a durned sight more.\" \"I doubt it,\" said Shorty surlily. \"I think me and you\u0027ll be fools as long as we live. We won\u0027t be fools the same way agin, you kin bet your life, but we\u0027ll find some other way.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63241.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
