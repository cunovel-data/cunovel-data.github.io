GOING TO WAR—SI KLEGG\u0027S COMPLETE EQUIPMENT AND WHAT BECAME OF IT.","content":"AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career. \n \n He was thrifty and provident, and believed in being ready for any emergency. His friends and family coincided with him. The Quartermaster provided him with a wardrobe that was serviceable, if not stylish, but there were many things that he felt he would need in addition. \n \n \"You must certainly have a few pairs of homeknit socks and some changes of underclothes,\" said his tearfully-solicitous mother. \"They won\u0027t weigh much, and they\u0027ll in all likelihood save you a spell of sickness.\" \n \n \"Certainly,\" responded Josiah, \"I wouldn\u0027t think of going away without \u0027em.\" \n \n Into the capacious knapsack went several pounds of substantial knit woolen goods. \n \n \"You can\u0027t get along without a couple of towels and a piece of soap,\" said his oldest sister, Maria, as she stowed those things alongside the socks and underclothes. \n \n \"Si,\" said Ellen, his second sister, \"I got this pocket album for my gift to you. It contains all our pictures, and there is a place for another\u0027s picture, whose name I suppose I needn\u0027t mention,\" she added archly. \n \n Si got a little red in the face, but said: \n \n \"Nothing could be nicer, Nell. It\u0027ll be the greatest comfort in the world to have all your pictures to look at when I\u0027m down in Dixie.\" \n \n \"Here\u0027s a \u0027housewife\u0027 I\u0027ve made for you with my own hands,\" added Annabel, who was some other fellow\u0027s sister. She handed him a neatly-stitched little cloth affair. \"You see, it has needles, thread, buttons, scissors, a fine-tooth comb, and several other things that you\u0027ll need very badly after you\u0027ve been in camp awhile. And\" (she got so near Si that she could whisper the rest) \"you\u0027ll find in a little secret pocket a lock of my hair, which I cut off this morning.\" \n \n \"I suppose I\u0027ll have a good deal of leisure time while we\u0027re in camp,\" said Si to himself and the others; \"I believe I\u0027ll just put this Ray\u0027s Arithmetic and Greene\u0027s Grammar in.\" \n \n \"Yes, my young friend,\" added the Rev. Boanarg, who had just entered the house, \"and as you will be exposed to new and unusual temptations, I thought it would be judicious to put this volume of \u0027Baxter\u0027s Call to the Unconverted\u0027 in your knapsack, for it may give you good counsel when you need it sorely.\" \n \n \"Thankee,\" said Si, stowing away the book. Of course, Si had to have a hair-brush, blackingbrush, a shaving kit, and some other toilet appliances. \n \n Si Decides to Enlist 017 \n \n Then it occurred to his thoughtful sister Maria that he ought to have a good supply of stationery, including pens, a bottle of ink, and a portfolio on which to write when he was far away from tables and desks. \n \n These went in, accompanied by a half-pint bottle of \"No. 6,\" which was Si\u0027s mother\u0027s specific for all the ills that flesh is heir to. Then, the blanket which the Quartermaster had issued seemed very light and insufficient to be all the bed-clothes a man would have when sleeping on the bare ground, and Si rolled up one of the warm counterpanes that had helped make the Indiana Winter nights so comfortable for him. \n \n \"Seems rather heavy,\" said Si as he put his knapsack on; \"but I guess I\u0027ll get used to it in a little while. They say that soldiers learn to carry surprising loads on their backs. It\u0027ll help cure me of being round-shouldered; it\u0027ll be better \u0027n shoulder-braces for holding me up straight.\" \n \n Of course, his father couldn\u0027t let him go away without giving him something that would contribute to his health and comfort, and at last the old gentleman had a happy thought—he would get the village shoemaker to make Si a pair of his best stout boots. They would be ever so much better than the shoes the Quartermaster furnished for tramping over the muddy roads and swamps of the South. Si fastened these on top of his knapsack until he should need them worse than at present. \n \n His old uncle contributed an immense bowie knife, which he thought would be of great use in the sanguinary hand-to-hand conflicts Si would have to wage. \n \n On the way to the depot Si found some of his comrades gathered around an enterprising retail dealer in hardware, who was convincing them that they could serve their country much better, besides adding to their comfort, by buying from him a light hatchet and a small frying-pan, which he offered, in consideration of their being soldiers, to sell them at remarkable low rates. \n \n Off to the War 019 \n \n Si saw at once the great convenience a hatchet and a frying-pan would be, and added them to his kit. An energetic dealer in tinware succeeded in selling him, before he reached the depot, a cunning little coffee-pot and an ingenious combination of knife, fork and spoon which did not weigh more than a pound. \n \n When he got in the cars he was chagrined to find that several of his comrades had provided themselves with convenient articles that he had not thought of. He consoled himself that the regiment would stop some time in Louisville, when he would have an opportunity of making up his deficiencies. \n \n But when the 200th reached Louisville there was no leisure for anything. Bragg was then running his celebrated foot-race with Buell for the Kentucky metropolis, and the 200th Ind. was trotted as rapidly as unused legs could carry it to the works several miles from the center of the city. \n \n Everybody who was in that campaign remembers how terribly hot and dry everything was. \n \n Si Klegg managed to keep up tolerably near the head of the column until camp was reached, but his shoulders were strained and blisters began to appear on his feet. \n \n \"That was a mighty tough pull, wasn\u0027t it?\" he said to his chum as they spread their blankets on the dog-kennel and made some sort of a bed; \"but I guess after a day or two we\u0027ll get so used to it that we won\u0027t mind it.\" \n \n For a few days the 200th Ind. lay in camp, but one day there came an order for the regiment to march to Bardstown as rapidly as possible. A battle was imminent. The roads were dusty as ash-heaps, and though the pace was not three miles an hour, the boys\u0027 tongues were hanging out before they were out of sight of camp. \n \n \"I say, Captain, don\u0027t they never have resting spells in the army?\" said Si. \n \n \"Not on a forced march,\" answered the Captain, who, having been in the first three months\u0027 service, was regarded as a veteran. \"Push on, boys; they say that they\u0027ll want us before night.\" Another hour passed. \n \n As si Looked when he Landed at Louisville 021 \n \n \"Captain, I don\u0027t believe you can put a pin-point anywhere on my feet that ain\u0027t covered with a blister as big as a hen\u0027s egg,\" groaned Si. \n \n \"It\u0027s too bad, I know,\" answered the officer; \"but you must go on. They say Morgan\u0027s cavalry are in our rear shooting down every straggler they can find.\" \n \n Si saw the boys around him lightening their knapsacks. He abominated waste above all things, but there seemed no help for it, and, reaching into that receptacle that bore, down upon his aching shoulders like a glacier on a groundhog, he pulled out and tossed into the fence corner the educational works he had anticipated so much benefit from. The bottle of \"No. 6\" followed, and it seemed as if the knapsack was a ton lighter, but it yet weighed more than any stack of hay on the home farm. \n \n A cloud of dust whirled up, and out of it appeared a galloping Aid. \n \n \"The General says that the 200th Ind. must push on much faster. The enemy is trying to get to the bridge ahead of them,\" he shouted as he dashed off in another cloud of dust. \n \n A few shots were heard in the rear. \n \n \"Morgan\u0027s cavalry are shooting some more stragglers,\" shouted some one. \n \n Si was getting desperate. He unrolled the counterpane and slashed it into strips with his bowie. \"My mother made that with her own hands,\" he explained to a comrade, \"and if I can\u0027t have the good of it no infernal rebel shall. He next slashed the boots up and threw them after the quilt, and then hobbled on to overtake the rest of his company. \n \n \"There\u0027s enough dry-goods and clothing lying along in the fence corners to supply a good-sized town,\" the Lieutenant-Colonel reported as he rode over the line of march in rear of the regiment. \n \n The next day Si\u0027s feet felt as if there was a separate and individual jumping toothache in every sinew, muscle, tendon and toe-nail; but that didn\u0027t matter. With Bragg\u0027s infantry ahead and John Morgan\u0027s cavalry in the rear, the 200th Ind. had to go forward so long as the boys could put one foot before the other. \n \n Si\u0027s Load Begins to Get Heavy 023 \n \n The unloading went on even more rapidly than the day before. \n \n \"My knapsack looks like an elephant had stept on it,\" Si said, as he ruefully regarded it in the evening. \n \n \"Show me one in the regiment that don\u0027t,\" answered his comrade. \n \n Thenceforward everything seemed to conspire to teach Si how vain and superfluous were the things of this world. The first rain-storm soaked his cherished album until it fell to pieces, and his sister\u0027s portfolio did the same. He put the photographs in his blouse pocket and got along just as well. When he wanted to write he got paper from the sutler. A mule tramped on his fancy coffee-pot, and he found he could make quite as good coffee in a quart-cup. A wagon-wheel lan over his cherished frying-pan, and he melted an old canteen in two and made a lighter and handier pan out of one-half of it. He broke his bowie-knife prying the lid off a cracker-box. He piled his knapsack with the others one day when the regiment was ordered to strip them off for a charge, and neither he nor his comrades ever saw one of them again. He never attempted to replace it. He learned to roll up an extra pair of socks and a change of underclothing in his blanket, tie the ends of this together and throw it over his shoulder sash fashion. Then, with his socks drawn up over the bottoms of his pantaloons, three days\u0027 rations in his haversack and 40 rounds in his cartridgebox, he was ready to make his 30 miles a day in any direction he might be sent, and whip anything that he encountered on the road. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63189.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
