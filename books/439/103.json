{"id":45138,"no":103,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. THE TROUBLESOME BOYS","content":"SI AND SHORTY\u0027S RECRUITS ENTER KENTUCKY. THE bright, active minds of the 65 boys that Si and Shorty were put in charge of were aflame with curiosity regarding everything connected with the war. For two years they had been fed on stories and incidents of the mighty conflict then convulsing the land. Every breath they had drawn had some taste of battle in it. Wherever they went or were they heard incessantly of the storm-swept \"front\"—of terrific battles, perilous adventures, heroic achievements, death, wounds and marvelous escapes. The older boys were all at the front, or going there, or coming back with heroic marks of shot and shell. The one burning aspiration in every well-constructed boy\u0027s heart was to get big enough to crowd past the recruiting officer, and go where he could see with his own eyes the thunderous drama. There was concentrated all that fills a healthy boy\u0027s imagination and stirs his blood—something greater than Indian-fighting, or hunting lions and tigers. They looked on Si and Shorty with little short of reverence. Here were two men who had captured a rebel flag in a hand-to-hand fight, both of whom had been left for dead, and both promoted for gallantry. What higher pinnacle of greatness could any boy hope to reach? They began at once seriously imitating the walk and manners of their heroes. The tall, lank boys modeled themselves on Shorty, and the short, chubby ones on Si. And there at once rose contention between them as to which was the greater hero. \"I heard,\" said Henry Joslyn, \"that Corpril Elliott was the first to reach the rebel flag, he havin\u0027 much the longest legs, but jest as he grabbed it a big rebel knocked him, and then they all piled on to him, and about had him finished when Serg\u0027t Klegg reached there at a charge bayonets, and he bayoneted everybody in sight, until a sharpshooter in a tree shot him with an explosive bullet that tore his breast all to pieces, but he kept right on bayonetin\u0027 \u0027em till he dropped from loss o\u0027 blood. Then they fired a cannon at the sharpshooter and blowed him to pieces just as you\u0027d blow a chippy to pieces with a bullet from a bear-gun.\" \"\u0027Twan\u0027t that way at all,\" said tall, lathy Gid Mackall. \"A whole lot of \u0027em made for the flag together. A charge o\u0027 grapeshot come along and blowed the rest away, but Serg\u0027t Klegg and Corpril Elliott kep\u0027 right on. Then Corpril Elliott he lit into the crowd o\u0027 rebels and laid a swath right around him, while Sergint Klegg grabbed the flag. A rebel Colonel shot him, but they couldn\u0027t stop Corpril Elliott till they shot a brass six-pounder at him.\" The boys stood on the banks of the Ohio River and gazed eagerly at the other side. There was the enemy\u0027s country—there the theater in which the great drama was being enacted. Everything there had a weird fascination for them, as a part of, or accessory to, the stupendous play. It was like peeping under the circus tent, when they were smaller, and catching glimpses of the flying horses\u0027 feet. And the questions they asked. Si had in a manner repelled them by his curt treatment of Harry Joslyn, and his preoccupied air as he went back and forth getting his orders and making preparations for starting. But Shorty was in an affable mood, and by pleasantly answering a few of their inquiries brought the whole fire of their questioning upon him. \"Are any o\u0027 them men you see over there guerrillas?\" they asked. \"Mebbe,\" Shorty answered. \"Kentucky\u0027s full of \u0027em. Mebbe they\u0027re peaceable citizens, though.\" \"How kin you tell the guerrillas from the citizens?\" \"By the way they shoot at you. The peaceable citizens don\u0027t shoot—at least, in day time and out in the open. They lay for you with sole-leather pies, and chuck-a-luck boards and 40-rod whisky, and aid. and abet the Southern Confedrisy that way. They get away with more union soldiers than the guerrillas do. But you can never tell what an able-bodied man in Kentucky\u0027ll do. He may lay for you all day with wildcat whisky, at $5 a canteenful, to git money to buy ammunition to shoot at you at night. He\u0027s surer o\u0027 gittin\u0027 you with a canteen o\u0027 never-miss whisky, but there\u0027s more healthy excitement about shootin\u0027 at you from behind a bank. And his pies is deadlier\u0027n his apple-jack. A man kin git over an apple-jack drunk, but Kentucky pies \u0027s wuss\u0027n nux vomica on fish.\" \"Mustn\u0027t we eat none o\u0027 their pies?\" asked the boys, with longing remembrance of the fragrant products of their mothers\u0027 ovens. \"Nary a pie. If I ketch a boy eatin\u0027 a pie after we cross the river I\u0027ll buck-and-gag him. Stick to plain hardtack and pork. You\u0027ll git to like it better\u0027n cake by and by. I eat it right along in preference to the finest cake ever baked.\" Shorty did not think it necessary to mention that this preference was somewhat compulsory. \"Why don\u0027t you hunt down the guerrillas and kill \u0027em off and be done with \u0027em?\" \"You can\u0027t, very well. You see, guerrilain\u0027 is peculiar. There\u0027s somethin\u0027 in the air and water down in Kentucky and Tennessee that brings it on a man. You\u0027ll see a plain farmer man, jest like them around your home, and he\u0027ll be all right, goin\u0027 about his place plowin\u0027 and grubbin\u0027 sprouts and tendin\u0027 to his stock, and tellin\u0027 you all the time how much he loves the union and how he and his folks always bin for the union. Next thing you know he\u0027ll be out behind a cedar bush with a shotgun loaded with slugs, waitin\u0027 to make a lead mine o\u0027 some feller wearin\u0027 blue clothes. You see him before he does you, and he\u0027ll swear that he was out after the crows that\u0027s bin pullin\u0027 up his corn. He\u0027ll take\u0027 the oath of allegiance like it was a dram of old apple-jack, and tears\u0027ll come into his eyes at the sight o\u0027 the Old Flag, which he and his\u0027n has always loved. He\u0027ll go ahead plowin\u0027 and grubbin\u0027 sprouts and tendin\u0027 his cattle till the fit comes on him agin to go gunnin\u0027 for bluecoats, and off he is, to go through the whole performance agin. You kin never tell how long his loosid interval will last, nor when the fit\u0027s comin\u0027 on him. Mebbe the changes o\u0027 the moon\u0027s somethin\u0027 to do with it. Mebbe it\u0027s somethin\u0027 that they eat, like what the cattle eat out West that makes \u0027em go crazy.\" \"Will the guerrillas begin shootin\u0027 at us as soon\u0027s we cross the river?\" \"Can\u0027t tell. Guerrillas\u0027s like the nose-bleed—likely to come on you at any time. They\u0027re jest where you find \u0027em—that\u0027s when they\u0027re jumpin\u0027 you.. When they aint jumpin\u0027 you, they\u0027re lawabiding union citizens, entitled to the protection o\u0027 the laws and to draw rations from the Commissary. To make no mistake, you want to play every man in citizen\u0027s clothes south of the Ohio River for a rebel. And when you don\u0027t see him, you want to be surer than ever, for then he\u0027s layin\u0027 for you.\" Si came up at this moment with orders for them to pick up and go down to the ferry, and the lively hustle shut off Shorty\u0027s stream of information for the time being. The boys swarmed on to the bow of the ferry-boat, where they could scrutinize and devour with eager eyes the fateful shore of Kentucky. \"Don\u0027t look so very different from the Indiana side,\" said Harry Joslyn, as they neared the wharf. \"Same kind o\u0027 wharf-boats and same kind o\u0027 men on \u0027em.\" \"That\u0027s because we\u0027ve taken \u0027em and have our own men there,\" replied Gid Mackall. \"It\u0027ll all be different when we git ashore and further into the State.\" \"Wasn\u0027t expecting nothing else,\" said Albert Grimes. \"I\u0027ve been watchin\u0027 the Sargint and Corpril, and they\u0027re acting just as if it was every day bizniss. I\u0027m not going to expect anything till I see them lookin\u0027 serious.\" They landed and walked to the depot through the streets of Louisville, which were also disappointingly like those they had seen elsewhere, with the stores open and people going about their business, as if no shadow of war brooded over the land. There were some more soldiers on the streets, and a considerable portion of the vehicles were army wagons, but this was all. \"When\u0027ll we see some rebels?\" the boys asked. \"Don\u0027t be impatient,\" said a soldier on the sidewalk; \"you\u0027ll see \u0027em soon enough, and more\u0027n you want to. You\u0027ll have to go a little further, but you\u0027ll find the woods full of \u0027em. You\u0027ll be wishin\u0027 you was back home in your little trundle-beds, where they ought\u0027ve kept you.\" \"Shut up, you coffee-boiler,\" shouted Shorty, striding toward him. \"These boys \u0027s goin\u0027 to the front, where you ought to be, and I won\u0027t have you sayin\u0027 a word to discourage \u0027em.\" \"Too bad about discouraging \u0027em,\" laughed another, who had a juster appreciation of the situation. \"You couldn\u0027t discourage that drove of kids with a hickory club.\" After the train left Louisville it passed between two strong forts bristling with heavy guns. Here was a reality of war, and the boys\u0027 tide of questions became a torrent that for once overslaughed Shorty\u0027s fine talent for fiction and misinformation. \"How many battles had been fought there?\" \"How many union soldiers had been killed?\" \"How many rebels?\" \"Where were they buried?\" \"How big a ball did the guns shoot?\" \"How far would it carry?\" \"How many men would it kill if they were put one behind another?\" \"How near would the guns come to hitting a man a mile off?\" \"Could the gunner knock a man\u0027s head off, or one of his legs, just as he pleased?\" \"Were the guns rifled or smooth-bore?\" \"How much powder did it take to load them?\" \"How hard did they kick when they were fired?\" \"Did they have flint-locks or caps?\" \"Did they ever fire chain-shot, which would cut down trees and sweep away companies of men?\" \"If all the rest of the men were killed wouldn\u0027t the powder-monkey get a chance to fire the gun?\" \"Look here, boys,\" gasped Shorty, when he got a chance to answer, \"I\u0027d like to answer your questions and fill you so plumb full o\u0027 information that your hides\u0027d crack to hold it. But I aint no complete history o\u0027 the war with heavy artillery tactics bound up in one volume. All I know is that the worst dose them forts ever give was to the fellers that had to build \u0027em. After you\u0027ve dug and shoveled and wheeled on one of \u0027em for about a month you\u0027ll hate the very sight of \u0027em and never ask no questions about \u0027em. All you\u0027ll want\u0027ll be to find and kill the feller that invented them brick-red eruptions on the face o\u0027 the earth.\" This was a prosaic side of the war that had not occurred to the boys. \u0027here, You Young Brats, What Are You up to 225 As the train ran out into the country there were plentiful signs of war to rivet the attention of the youngsters—hospitals, with the emaciated patients strolling feebly about; corrals of mules and horses, the waste and wreckage where camps had been, and bridges which had been burned and rebuilt. \"But we haint seen no guerrillas yit,\" said Harry Joslyn and Gid Mackall, whose minds seemed more fascinated with that species of an enemy than any other, and they apparently voiced the minds of the rest. \"When\u0027re we likely to see some guerrillas?\" \"O, the guerrillas are layin\u0027 purty low now, betwixt here and Nashville,\" Si carelessly explained. \"After we pass Nashville you kin begin to look out for \u0027em.\" \"Why,\" Gid Mackall complained to the rest of them, \"Corpril Elliott said that we could begin to look out for guerrillas jest as soon\u0027s we crossed the Ohio—that the whole o\u0027 Kentucky was full of \u0027em. I believe Corpril Elliott knows more about his business than Sargint Klegg. Sargint Klegg seems careless like. I see lots o\u0027 fellers along the road in butternut clothes that seemed savage and sneaky like. They looked at us in a way that made me certain they wuz spying us, and had their guns hid away somewhere, ready to jump us whenever there wuz a good chanst.\" \"So did I,\" chorused the others. The train made a long stop on a switch and manuvered around a while, taking on some cars found there, and Si and Shorty seeing nothing to do went forward to another car, where they found some returning veterans, and were soon absorbed in a game of seven-up. Shorty had just successfully turned a jack from the bottom, and was snickering to himself that his fingers had not lost their cunning by long idleness, when the game was interrupted by a train-hand rushing up with the information: \"Here, you fellers, you want to git out there and \u0027tend to them kids o\u0027 your\u0027n. They\u0027ve got a couple o\u0027 citizens down there in the brush and I believe are goin\u0027 to hang \u0027em.\" Si and Shorty ran down in the direction indicated. They found the boys, stern-eyed and resolute, surrounding two weak-eyed, trembling \"crackers,\" who had apparently come to the train with baskets of leathery-crusted dried-apple pies for sale. The men were specimens of the weak-minded, weak-bodied, lank-haired \"po\u0027 white trash,\" but the boys had sized them up on sight as dangerous spies and guerrillas, had laid hands on them and dragged them down into the brush, where Gid Mackall and Harry Joslyn were doing a fair reproduction of Williams, Paulding and Van Wert searching Maj. Andre\u0027s clothes for incriminating documents. They had the prisoners\u0027 hands tied behind them and their ankles bound. So far they had discovered a clumsy brass-barreled pistol and an ugly-looking spring dirk, which were sufficient to confirm the dangerous character of the men. Two of the boys had secured ropes from the train, which they were trying to fashion into hangman\u0027s nooses. Gid and Harry finished a painstaking examination of the men\u0027s ragged jeans vests, with a look of disappointment at finding nothing more inculpating that some fishhooks, chunks of twist tobacco and cob-pipes. \"They must have \u0027em in their boots, boys. Pull \u0027em off,\" said Harry. \"There\u0027s where spies usually carry their most important papers.\" \"Here, you young brats, what are you up to?\" demanded Si, striding in among them. \"Why, Sargint,\" said Harry Joslyn, speaking as if confident of being engaged in a praisworthy work, which should receive the commendation of his superiors, \"these\u0027re two spies and guerrillas that we ketched right in the act, and we\u0027re searchin\u0027 \u0027em for evidence to hang \u0027em.\" \"Spies nothin\u0027!\" said Si. \"Why, them fellers hain\u0027t brains enough to tell a battery from a regiment, nor pluck enough to take a settin\u0027 hen offen her nest. Let them go at once.\" \"Why, Corpril Elliott told us that every man in Kentucky, particularly them what sold pies, wuz dangerous, and liable to go guerrillying at any minute,\" said Harry in an aggrieved tone. \"These fellers seemed to be sneakin\u0027 down to find that we hadn\u0027t no guns and then jump us.\" \"Well, what I said wuz true on jineral principles,\" laughed Shorty. \"But there\u0027s occasionally exceptions to even what I tell you. These fellers are as harmless as garter-snakes. Why didn\u0027t you come and speak to us?\" \"Why, you shoved our car out there into the brush and went off and left us. We thought we had to look out for ourselves,\" explained Harry. \"Can\u0027t we hang \u0027em, anyway?\" he added in an appealing tone, and the rest of the boys looked wistfully at Si for permission to proceed. \"No, you can\u0027t, I tell you. Turn \u0027em loose this minute, and give \u0027em back their things, and go yourselves to your car. We\u0027re goin\u0027 to start now. Here,\" he continued to the two men, \"is a dollar. Take your pies and dig out. Don\u0027t attempt to sell any o\u0027 them pies to these boys, or I\u0027ll hang you myself, and there won\u0027t be no foolishness about it. Git back to your car, boys.\" \"There won\u0027t be no hangin\u0027, and we won\u0027t git none o\u0027 the pies,\" complained the boys among themselves. \"Sargint Klegg\u0027s gittin\u0027 overbearin\u0027. What\u0027d he interfere for? Them fellers was guerrillas, as sure as you\u0027re born, just as Corpril Elliott described \u0027em before we crossed the river.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63290.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
