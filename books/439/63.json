{"id":45098,"no":63,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. AN UNEXPECTED MARRIAGE","content":"THE BOYS CAPTURE REBELS AND ADMINISTER THE OATH. THE REBEL Major accepted the unexpected turn of events with soldierly philosophy. Tuggers, captured in a blue uniform, saw the ignominious fate of a spy loom up before his eyes. His face grew very white and set. He sat down on a log, looked far away, and seemed oblivious to everything around him. Jeff Hackberry and Sol Simmons were frightened into nerveless terror, and occasionally sighed and groaned audibly. Their men huddled together like frightened sheep, and looked anxiously at every move of their captors. \u0027Squire Corson had ventured two or three remarks in a judicial and advisory way, but had been ordered by Capt. McGillicuddy to sit down and keep quiet. He took a seat on a stump, pulled a large bandana out of his beaver crowned hat, wiped his bald head, and anxiously surveyed the scene as if looking for an opportunity when the power and dignity of the State of Tennessee might be invoked to advantage. Only Mrs. Bolster retained her aggressiveness and her tongue. If anything, she seemed to be more savage and virulent than ever. She was wild that she had been outwitted, and particularly by Si, whose fluent speech had returned the moment the224 firecrackers went oif. She poured out volleys of scorching epithets on all the Yankees from President Lincoln down to Corp\u0027l Si Klegg, and fervently invoked for them speedy death and eternal torment where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched. Capt. McGillicuddy rounded up his prisoners, took arms from those who still retained them, had Si and Shorty do what they could toward dressing the Major\u0027s wound, and then began an examination of the house. He found abundant evidence of all that he, Si and Shorty had believed of it. It was a rendezvous for spies, both great and small—both those, like Mrs. Bolster, who infested our camps, and got news of whatever was going on there, and those who operated on a larger scale, passing directly from the Headquarters of the rebels to the Headquarters of ours, and to the rear, and the sources of information at Nashville and Louisville. It was an important station on the route for smuggling gun-caps, quinine, medicines and other contraband from the North. Quantities of these were there waiting to be forwarded. As the source of the fighting whisky introduced into the camp of the 200th Ind. too much was known of it to require any further information. And it was more than probable that it was the scene of darker crimes—union soldiers lured thither under some pretext, murdered and robbed. \"How in the world am I going to break this infernal nest up?\" said Capt. McGillicuddy, with a puzzled air, after he had ordered the whisky destroyed and the other things gotten in shape to send225 back to camp. \"By rights, I ought to burn that house down, but that would leave all these children without shelter. By the same token, I ought to shoot or at least send off to prison that old she-catamount, but that would mean starving the children to death. I declare, I don\u0027t know what to do.\" He had drawn apart a little with Si and Shorty, to whom he spoke confidentially, while casting his eyes about him as if seeking some solution of the problem. \"If you\u0027ll allow me. Captain,\" said Shorty, \"I\u0027ve an idee. Now that we\u0027ve got the trap, let\u0027s set it agin, and see if we can\u0027t ketch some more.\" \"Splendid idea. Shorty,\" said the Captain, catching on at once. \"And my idee,\" said Shorty, emboldened by the reception of his first suggestion, \"is that you take all the company but me and Si and four or fire of the boys back to camp, leavin\u0027 us here until to-morrow at least. There\u0027ll probably some very interestin\u0027 men happen along here to-night, not knowing what\u0027s happened, and we\u0027ll jest quietly yank \u0027em in.\" \"That\u0027s good,\" assented the Captain. \"In the meantime,\" continued Shorty, \"you kin be considerin\u0027 what you\u0027ll do with the house. It may be best to let it stand, and watch it. That\u0027s a good way to do with a bee-tree or a woodchuck hole. \"I believe you are right. I\u0027ll do as you say. Si, you and Shorty pick out as many men as you want to stay with you. I\u0027ll leave one of these horses with you. If you should happen to need any more, mount one of the boys and send him back for help. I\u0027ll come out with the whole company.\"226 Shorty and Si consulted together for a few minutes, picked out their men, gave their names to the Captain, and received his assent to the selection. Then Shorty said: \"Captain, you don\u0027t want to take that old woman, the \u0027Squire and that skunk they call Jeff Hackberry back to camp with you, do you? Leave \u0027em here with us. I\u0027ve got a little scheme.\" \"The old woman and the \u0027Squire you can take and welcome,\" answered the Captain. \"I\u0027ll be glad to have them oif my hands. But Hackberry is a rebel soldier. I don\u0027t know about giving him up.\" \"Leave him with us, then. We\u0027ll turn him back to you all right, and the old woman and the \u0027Squire, too, if you want \u0027em.\" \"No,\" said the Captain, with an impatient wave of his hand. \"Keep them, do what you please with them. If you should accidentally kill the old woman I should not be unduly distressed. But don\u0027t let Hackberry get away from you. I\u0027ll take the rest back to camp, and I must start at once, for it\u0027s getting late, and we didn\u0027t bring any rations with us. Do you suppose you can find enough around the house to keep you till morning?\" \"O, yes,\" said Si. \"There\u0027s a sack of meal in there and some side-meat. We gave the old woman a lot of coffee. We\u0027ll make out all right.\" The prisoners had been watching the Captain and his men with greatest anxiety. They now saw Si with his squad take the \u0027Squire. Mrs. Bolster and Hackberry off to one side, while the Captain placed the remainder of the prisoners in the center of his company and started back to camp with them.227 There was something in this separation that terrified even Mrs. Bolster, who stopped railing and began to look frightened. \"What are yo\u0027uns goin\u0027 to do with we\u0027uns?\" she inquired hoarsely of Si. \"You\u0027ll find out soon enough,\" said Si significantly. \"Set down there on that log and think about what you deserve. You might put in any spare time you have in doing some big repentin\u0027.\" Hackberry began to whine and beg for mercy, but Shorty ordered him to keep silent. \"I want you to understand,\" said the \u0027Squire, \"that I\u0027m a regerlarly elected and qualified Magistrate o\u0027 the State o\u0027 Tennessee; that I\u0027m not subjeck to military laws, and if any harm comes to me you\u0027ll have to answer for it to the State o\u0027 Tennessee.\" \"Blast the State o\u0027 Tennessee,\" said Shorty contemptuously. \"When we git through there won\u0027t be no State o\u0027 Tennessee. It\u0027ll be roasting in the same logheap with South Caroliny and Virginny, with Jeff Davis brilin\u0027 in the middle.\" \"Boys,\" ordered Si, \"a couple of you look around the house and see if you can\u0027t find a mattock and shovel.\" Terrible fears assailed the three unhappy prisoners at this. What could a mattock and shovel be wanted for but to dig their graves? Shorty stepped over a little distance to a large clump of \"red-sticks.\" These grow in long wands of brilliant red, as straight as a corn-stalk, and slenderer. They are much used about the farms of the South for rods for rough measurement. He cut one off about six feet long and stripped off its leaves.228 The anxious eyes of the prisoners followed every movement. Two of the boys appeared with an old mattock and shovel. \"Guess you\u0027d better dig right over there,\" said Si, indicating a little bare knoll. \"Nothin\u0027 else\u0027s ever bin planted there. At least nothin\u0027s ever come up. The chances are agin their comin\u0027 up if we plant \u0027em there.\" \"Stand up,\" said Shorty, approaching Hackberry with the bright crimson rod in his hand. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to measure you for a grass-green suit that\u0027ll last you till Gabriel blows his horn.\" Hackberry gave a howl of terror. The \u0027Squire and Mrs. Bolster began a clamor of protests. \"Don\u0027t fuss,\" said Shorty calmly to them, as he took Hackberry\u0027s dimensions. \"I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to show no partiality. I\u0027ll serve you both the same way. Your turns \u0027ll come after his\u0027n.\" The children, aware that something unusual was going on, yet unable to comprehend what it was, stood silently around, their fingers in their mouths and their vacant eyes fixed in the stolid stare of the mountaineer youth. Even the dogs were quiet, and seemed watching the scene with more understanding than the children. Mrs. Bolster\u0027s mood suddenly changed from bitter vituperation. She actually burst into tears, and began pleading for her life, and making earnest promises as to better conduct in the future. The \u0027Squire and Hackberry followed suit, and blubbered like schoolboys. Mrs. Bolster reminded Si and Shorty how she had saved them from being killed by the229 fierce Hackberry and the still fiercer Simmons. This seemed to move them. She tried a ghastly travesty of feminine blandishments by telling Shorty how handsome she had thought him, and had fallen in love with him at first sight. Shorty gave a grimace at this. He and Si stepped back a little for consultation. When they came back Shorty said oracularly: \"Our orders is strict, and we should\u0027ve carried \u0027em out at once. But, talkin\u0027 with my partner here, we\u0027re reminded o\u0027 somethin\u0027. We believe it\u0027s the law that when a man or woman is sentenced to death the execution kin be put off if they kin find anybody to marry \u0027em. Is that good law, \u0027Squire?\" \"H-m-m,\" answered the Magistrate, resuming his judicial manner at once; \"that is a general belief, and I\u0027ve heard o\u0027 some instances of it. But before sayin\u0027 positively, I should like to examine the authorities an\u0027 hear argument.\" \"Well, there hain\u0027t goin\u0027 to be no continuance in this case for you to look up authorities and hear arguments,\" said Shorty decisively. \"We\u0027re the higher court in this case, and we decided that the law\u0027s good enough for it. We\u0027ve settled that if Mrs. Bolster \u0027ll marry Hackberry, and Hackberry \u0027ll marry Mrs. Bolster, and you\u0027ll marry \u0027em both, we\u0027ll grant a stay o\u0027 proceedings in the matter o\u0027 the execution o\u0027 the sentence o\u0027 death until we kin be advised by the higher authorities.\" \"I\u0027ll do anything. Mister,\" blubbered Hackberry. \"I\u0027ll marry her this minnit. Say the words, \u0027Squire.\" \"I\u0027ve said I\u0027d rather die 10 times over than marry yo\u0027, Jeff Hackberry,\" murmured Mrs. Bolster. \"I\u0027ve280 bin the wife o\u0027 one ornery snipe of a whisky-sucking sand-digger, and when the Lord freed me from him I said I\u0027d never git yoked with another. But I s\u0027pose I\u0027ve got to live for my children, though the Lord knows the yaller-headed brats hain\u0027t wuth hit. They\u0027re everyone of \u0027em their dad over agin—all Bolsters, and not wuth the powder to blow \u0027em to kingdom come. I\u0027d a heap ruther marry Jeff Hackberry to make sure o\u0027 havin\u0027 him shot than to save him from shootin\u0027.\" \"You hain\u0027t no choice, Madam,\" said Shorty severely. \"Law and orders is strict on that pint.\" \"Well, then,\" said she, \"since hit\u0027s a ch\u0027ice betwixt death and Jeff Hackberry, I\u0027ll take Jeff Hackberry, though I wouldn\u0027t take him on no other terms, and I\u0027m afeared I\u0027m makin\u0027 a mistake as hit is.\" \"What do you say, \u0027Squire?\" asked Shorty. \"I\u0027ve bin studyin\u0027 on jest whar I come in,\" answered the Magistrate. \"These two save their necks by marryin\u0027, but do you understand that the law says that the Magistrate who marries \u0027em gits his neck saved?\" \"The court is not clear on that as a p\u0027int o\u0027 law,\" said Shorty; \"but in the present case it\u0027ll hold that the \u0027Squire who does the splicin\u0027 gets as much of a rake-off as the rest. This is not to be considered a precedent, however.\" \"All right,\" assented the \u0027Squire; \"let the couple jine hands.\" With an air of glad relief, Hackberry sprang up and put out his hand. Mrs. Bolster came up more slowly and reluctantly grasped his hairy fist in her231 large, skinny hand. The \u0027Squire stood up before them in his most impressive attitude. \"Hold on,\" suddenly called out Tom Welch, who was the \"guard-house lawyer\" of Co. Q, and constantly drawing the \"Regulations,\" the \"Tactics,\" and the \"Constitution and Laws of the United States,\" in which he was sharply proficient, upon the members of the regiment. \"I raise the point that the \u0027Squire can\u0027t officiate until he has taken the oath of allegiance to the United States.\" Si and Shorty looked at one another. \"That\u0027s a good point,\" said Si. \"He\u0027s got to take the oath of allegiance.\" \"Never,\" shouted the \u0027Squire, who had begun to recover his self-confidence. \"Never, as long as I live. I\u0027ve sworn allegiance to the Southern Confederacy, and won\u0027t take no other oath.\" \"Grave for one!\" called out Shorty to the boys with the pick and shovel, as if he were giving an order in a restaurant. \"Full size, and hurry up with it.\" He picked up his measuring rod and started to take the \u0027Squire\u0027s dimensions. The \u0027Squire wilted at once. \"I s\u0027pose I\u0027ve got to yield to force,\" he muttered. \"I\u0027ll take the oath.\" \"Who knows the oath?\" inquired Si. \"Do you, Tom?\" \"Not exactly,\" replied Tom, non-plused for once. \"But I know the oath we took when mustered in. That ought to do. What\u0027s good enough for us is good enough for him.\" \"Go ahead,\" ordered Si. \"We ought to have a Bible by rights,\" said Tom.232 \"Where kin we find your Bible, Mrs. Bolster, asked Si. \"We\u0027uns air done clean out o\u0027 Bibles,\" she said, rather shamefacedly. \"Thar hain\u0027t nary one in the house. I allers said we orter have a Bible. Hit looked \u0027spectable to have one in the house. But Andy allers wanted every cent to guzzle on.\" \"Here\u0027s a Testament. That\u0027ll do,\" said Tom, handing Si one which some of the boys had about him. \"Le\u0027s make \u0027em all take the oath while we\u0027re at it.\" \"You\u0027ll all raise your right hands,\" said Si, opening the book. \"Place your left on this book, and repeat the words after that man there, givin\u0027 your own names.\" Si was as solemn about it as he believed everyone should be at such a ceremony. Hackberry and Mrs. Bolster were not sure which were their right hands, but Si finally got them started, and Tom Welch repeated slowly and impressively: \"You do solemnly swear to support the Constitution and laws of the United States, and all laws made in pursuance thereof, against all enemies and opposers whatsoever, whether foreign or domestic, and to obey the orders of all officers duly appointed over you. So help you God, and kiss this book.\" \"And to quit liquor selling, smuggling, spying and giving aid and comfort to the enemy,\" added Shorty, and this was joined to the rest of the oath. \"I ought to have added that they wash their faces once a day, and put more shortenin\u0027 and fillin\u0027 in Mrs. Bolster\u0027s pies,\" said Shorty in an undertone to233 Si. \"But I suppose we oughtn\u0027t to ask impossible things.\" \"Now go ahead with the wedding ceremony,\" ordered Si. Again the \u0027Squire commanded them to join hands, and after mumbling over the fateful words, pronounced Thomas Jefferson Hackberry and Mrs. Sophronia Bolster man and wife. \"Now,\" said Shorty, who felt at last fully insured against a great danger, \"I believe it\u0027s the law and custom for all the witnesses to a weddin\u0027 to see the bride and bridegroom in bed together. You\u0027ll go inside the house and take one of them beds, and after we\u0027ve seen you there we\u0027ll consider your cases further. You\u0027re all right, anyway, until we hear from camp to-morrow.\" Amid the grins of the rest the boys conducted the newly-weds into the house. He and Si brought out the sack of meal, a few cooking utensils, a side of bacon, and the package of coffee, which they gave to the other boys to get supper with. They closed the door behind them, excluding the children and dogs, and left the pair to their own reflections. \"Gentlemen, what air you gwine to do with me?\" asked the \u0027Squire. \"I\u0027d powerful like to git on home, if you\u0027ve no further use for me.\" \"We hain\u0027t decided what to do with you, you old fomenter o\u0027 rebellion,\" said Si. \"We ought to shoot you for what you\u0027ve done in stirring up these men to fight us. We\u0027ll settle your case to-morrow. You\u0027ll stay with us till then. We\u0027ll give you your234 supper, and after awhile you kin go in and sleep in that other bed, with the children.\" The \u0027Squire gave a dismal groan at the prospect, which was lost on the boys, who were very hungry and hurrying around helping to get supper. They built a fine fire and cooked a bountiful meal, of which all, including the \u0027Squire and children, partook heartily. A liberal portion, with big cups of strong coffee, were sent into the bridal couple. As bed-time drew near, they sent the \u0027Squire and the children into the house, and divided themselves up into reliefs to watch during the night.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63250.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
