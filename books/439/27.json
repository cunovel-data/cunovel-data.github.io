STILL ON THE MARCH","content":"SI AND SHORTY STOP ON THE WAY LONG ENOUGH TO BAG SIX REBS. \\n\\n \\n\\n SI CALLED out to the other boys by name to come up and join him. \\n\\n \\n\\n The rebel Sergeant mentally tallied off each name as it was called. A flush of shame and anger mounted to his face as Si concluded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gol darn hit,\" he said, \"you\u0027uns hain\u0027t got ez many ez we\u0027uns; they hain\u0027t nigh ez good men ez we\u0027uns, an\u0027 they\u0027uns ain\u0027t heah. We\u0027uns air Tennesseans, an\u0027 you\u0027uns hain\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027ve got enough, an\u0027 they\u0027re good enough,\" said Si sententiously. \"Injianny turns out better men than Tennessee ever dreamed o\u0027 doing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t believe hit a mite,\" said the Sergeant, stooping down and picking up a piece of cedar, which made a formidable club. \"We\u0027uns is not a-gwine back with yo\u0027uns nary a step. By rights, we\u0027uns orter take yo\u0027uns back with we\u0027uns. But I\u0027m willin\u0027 to call hit off, and let yo\u0027uns go ef yo\u0027uns \u0027ll let we\u0027uns go. Is hit a bargain?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not by 40 rows o\u0027 apple trees it ain\u0027t,\" said Si, stepping back a little to get a better range, and fixing his bayonet. \"I\u0027ve set my heart on takin\u0027 you back to Co. Q, an\u0027 back to Co. Q you\u0027ll go, if Si Klegg knows himself.\"38 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you\u0027ll go in a hurry, too,\" said Shorty. \"It\u0027s gettin\u0027 late, and I\u0027m always afraid to be out after dark. Mosey, now!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The other rebels were picking up clubs similar to the Sergeant\u0027s and casting their eyes on him for the signal to attack. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"See here,\" said Si desperately, cocking his gun. \"Don\u0027t waste no more time in words. This hain\u0027t a debatin\u0027 society. You\u0027re goin\u0027 back to Co. Q or going somewhere else thunderin\u0027 quick. Sergeant, if you make a move agin me I\u0027ll surely blow your head off en you, an\u0027 jab my bayonet through the next man. My partner, Shorty, is a worse man than I am, an\u0027 I can\u0027t tell how many of you he\u0027ll kill. He\u0027s awful quick-tempered, too, towards evening, an\u0027 liable to begin shooting any minute without warnin\u0027. It\u0027ll save several lives if you start right off on the jump, straight toward the rear, an\u0027 keep it up, with out looking to the right or left, until you reach Co. Q. You\u0027ll find the trail we made comin\u0027 in. Take it this minute.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The rebel Sergeant\u0027s eyes looked directly into the dark muzzle of Si\u0027s gun. They glanced along the barrel, and met one eye looking directly through the sights, while the other was closed, in the act of taking deliberate aim. He decided with great promptness that there were many reasons why he should prefer to be a live rebel in a Yankee prison, rather than a badly-disfigured dead one in a lonely cedar thicket. He dropped his club, turned around, and made his way along the path over which Si had come. The rest followed, with Si and Shorty a few paces in the rear. \\n\\n \\n\\n Palpitating with pride, Si marched his prisoners up to the company, who gave him three cheers. The Captain ordered him to report with his prisoners to the Colonel. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si Reports to the Colonel 38 \\n\\n \\n\\n The Colonel praised him with words that made his blood tingle.40 \\n\\n \\n\\n The skirmishing off to the right had now ceased. The rebels had fallen back to the next hilltop, and the 200th Ind. was ordered to go into camp where it stood. \\n\\n \\n\\n Preparing Supper 40 \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a fine place for a camp. The mud of the day before was frozen into stony hardness. The wagons had no difficulty in coming up. There was wood and water in abundance, and it seemed that the command \"Break ranks March!\" had hardly been uttered when great, bright, comfort-giving fires of fragrant cedar rails flashed up all along the line. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si and Shorty found several cedar stumps and logs, which they rolled together, and made a splendid fire. They cooked themselves an ample supper of fried pork, toasted hardtack, and strong, fragrant coffee, which they devoured with an appetite and a keen enjoyment only possible to healthy young men who have had a day of active manuvering and marching in the crisp, chill air of December. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then they gathered a lot of cedar branches, and made a thick mattress of them near the fire, upon which to spread their blankets for the night. \\n\\n \\n\\n This was a new suggestion by Shorty, and an amazing success. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I declare, Shorty,\" said Si, as he lay down on the bed to try it, \"I often wonder where you get all your ideas. For a man who wasn\u0027t raised on the Wabash you know an awful sight. Mebbe, if you\u0027d actually been born in Posey County you\u0027d a-knowed enough to be a Jigadier-Brindle. Then I\u0027d a lost you for a pard. This\u0027s a great invention. Why, it\u0027s softer and comfortabler than one of mother\u0027s feather beds. When I get out of the army, I\u0027m going to sleep on nothin\u0027 but cedar boughs.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There, you\u0027re at it again the Wabash forever,\" returned Shorty, good-humoredly. \"They raise the finest corn and cattle in the world on the Wabash, I\u0027ll admit, and some fairly good soldiers. But where\u0027ll you get any cedars there to make beds with? You\u0027ll have to go back to sleepin\u0027 on wheat straw and corn husks, with chicken-feather pillers. But after42 the way you stood up to that rebel Sergeant to-day I\u0027ll never say another word about ager and milk-sick en the Wabash, and I\u0027ll lick any other feller that does. There wasn\u0027t a speck of ager in your gizzard when you ordered him forward, or you\u0027d blow his Southern Confederacy head off.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There was more ager there than you thought, Shorty,\" Si admitted softly. \"I was awfully scared, for there was six to us two, and if that feller \u0027d had the right kind of sand he\u0027d a-jumped me at once, before I could get my gun up. The moment he began to palaver I knowed I had him. But I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 died in my tracks before I\u0027d let him go, and I knowed you would, too. You\u0027re the best pard a feller ever had.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And he reached over and took Shorty\u0027s rough hand and squeezed it affectionately. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can bet on you every time, even when I don\u0027t think it\u0027s quite safe to bet on myself. And, Shorty,\" he continued, with his eyes kindling, \"it was worth all that we\u0027ve gone through since we\u0027ve been in the army, even all that time in the rain, to have the Colonel speak as he did to us before the rest of the boys. I\u0027d be willing to enlist three years more if father and mother and sisters, and and Annabel could have heard him. I tell you, war has some glorious things in it, after all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He sat there on his bed before the fire, with his feet curled up under him in the comfortable way that it takes months of field service to acquire, and gazed steadily into the bank of glowing coals. They suffused his face and body with their generous warmth, and helped lift his soul toward the skies.43 \\n\\n \\n\\n He was much happier than he had ever been before in his life. The trials of the day before were hardly more than a far-away dream. The fears and anxieties of the coming battle were forgotten. The ruddy embers became a radiant vista, which Pride and Hope and Joy filled with all that he wanted to see. He saw there the dear old home on the Wabash, his father seated by the evening lamp reading the paper, while his mother knit on the other side of the table. His sisters were busy with some feminine trifles, and Annabel had come in to learn the news. They would hear what he had done, and of the Colonel\u0027s words of praise before the regiment, and his father\u0027s heart would glow with pride and his mother\u0027s eyes suffuse with tears. And Annabel but it passed words, passed thought, almost, what she would say and think. \\n\\n \\n\\n Just then tattoo rang out clear and musical on the chill night air. The rattling military \"good night\" had never before had any special charms for Si. But now he thought it an unusually sweet composition. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I declare,\" he said to Shorty, \"that sheepskin band of our\u0027n is improving. They\u0027re getting to play real well. But I ought to write a few lines home before taps. Got any paper. Shorty?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Much paper you\u0027ll find in this regiment after that rain,\" said Shorty contemptuously, as he knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and started to fall in for roll-call. \"Every mite of paper anybody has was soaked to spitwads. But mebbe the Orderly might have a sheet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n After roll-call Si went to the Orderly-Sergeant.44 \\n\\n \\n\\n Nothing in reason could then be refused Si, and the Orderly tore a couple of leaves out of the back of his treasured diary, which had escaped the rain, and handed them to him. Si fished his stub of a pencil out of his blouse-pocket, laid the paper on the back of a tin plate, and began: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Somewhere in Tennessee, \\n\\n December the 27th, 1862. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dere Annabel: We\u0027re movin\u0027 on Murphysboro, \\n\\n where we expect a big fite. There\u0027s bin fitin\u0027 goin\u0027 \\n\\n on ever since we left Nashville, but the 200th Ind. \\n\\n hain\u0027t had no hand in it so far, except this after \\n\\n noon me and Shorty\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He stopped, stuck his pencil in his mouth, and began to study just what words he should use to describe the occurrence. He wanted to tell her all that was bubbling in his heart, and yet he was afraid she would think him an intolerable boaster, if he told it in just the words that came to him. He was more afraid of that little country girl\u0027s disapproval than of all the rebels in Murfreesboro. \\n\\n \\n\\n There were yells, the rattling of chains, and the sound of galloping hoofs coming toward him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hi, there; stop them condemned mules!\" shouted the voice of a teamster. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si jumped to his feet, for the mules were charging directly for his fire, and were almost upon him. He dropped paper, pan and pencil, and jumped to one side, just in time to avoid a rush which scattered his fire, his carefully-prepared bed, and all his be longings under 24 flying, hard-pounding hoofs. \\n\\n \\n\\n After the Mules Stampeded 44 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Blast mules, anyhow,\" said the driver, coming up with his whip in his hand. \"I didn\u0027t hev nothin\u0027 for them to eat but a cottonwood pole that I cut down in the bottom. But they must have smelt fodder over there somewhere, and they broke for it like the devil beatin\u0027 tanbark. Hope you weren\u0027t hurt, pard.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si and Shorty fixed up their fire again, rearranged46 their scattered cedar boughs, and did the best they could with their torn blankets. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si found that a mule\u0027s hoof had landed squarely on his tin plate, mashed all future usefulness out of it, and stamped his letter to Annabel into unrecognizability. \\n\\n \\n\\n He threw the rent fragments into the fire, sighed deeply, and crawled under the blankets with Shorty, just as three sounding taps on the bass-drum commanded silence and lights out in the camp. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63214.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
