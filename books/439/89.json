{"id":45124,"no":89,"title":"CHAPTER II. THE DEACON ATTEMPTED RESTITUTION","content":"TRIED TO RETURN THE HORSE TO HIS OWNER. \n \n SI AND SHORTY were on the anxious lookout for the Deacon when he arrived, and not a little worried lest something might have befallen him. \n \n Si\u0027s weakness made him peevish and fretful, and Shorty was not a great deal better. \n \n \"It\u0027s an awful risk to have an old man and a civilian come down here into camp,\" Si complained. \"And he oughtn\u0027t to go about alone. He\u0027s always been used to mingling with the quiet, honest, respectable people. Up home the people are as honest as the day is long. They\u0027re religious and peaceable, and Pap\u0027s never knowed no other kind. He wouldn\u0027t harm nobody for the world, and none o\u0027 them\u0027d harm him. He\u0027s only a child among these toughs down here. I wisht one of us was able to be with him all the time.\" \n \n \"That father o\u0027 yours is certainly quite an innocent old party,\" Shorty answered, consolingly, \"and the things he don\u0027t know about army life\u0027d make more\u0027n a pamphlet. But he has a way of wakin\u0027 up to the situation that is sometimes very surprisin\u0027. I wisht I was able to go about with him, but I think he\u0027s fully able to take care o\u0027 himself around in camp. There\u0027s always somebody about who won\u0027t see an old man and a citizen imposed on. But what I\u0027m afraid of is that he\u0027s wandered out in the country, huntin\u0027 for somethin\u0027 for us to eat, and the guerrillas\u0027ve got him.\" \n \n And he and Si shuddered at the thought of that good old man in the hands of the merciless scoundrels who infested the mountains and woods beyond the camps. \n \n \"Yes,\" mourned Si, \"Pap\u0027s likely to mosey out into the country, jest like he would on Bean Blossom Crick, and stop at the first house he come to, and set down with \u0027em on the porch, and talk about the weather, and the crops, and the measles in the neighborhood, and the revivals, and the price o\u0027 pork and corn, and whether they\u0027d better hold their wheat till Spring, and who was comin\u0027 up for office, and all the time the bushwhackers\u0027d be sneakin\u0027 up on him, an\u0027 him know no more \u0027bout it than where the blackbirds was roostin\u0027. He\u0027s jest that innocent and unsuspiciouslike.\" \n \n \"If they\u0027ve ketched him,\" said Shorty fiercely, \"we\u0027ll find out about it, and when we git able, we\u0027ll go out there and kill and burn everything for five miles around. I\u0027ll do it, if I have to spend the rest o\u0027 my life at hard labor on the Dry Tortugas.\" \n \n They heard the rattle of light wheels on the frozen ground outside, and the hoof-beats of a quickly-moving horse. \n \n \"Buggy or spring-wagon,\" muttered Si with a farmer boy\u0027s instinctive interpretation of such sounds. \"What\u0027s it doin\u0027 in camp? Strange horse. In better condition than any around here.\" \n \n The vehicle stopped in front of the corn-crib at the Deacon\u0027s command, \"Whoa!\" \n \n \"Gracious—there\u0027s Pap now,\" ejaculated Si, with whom memory went in a bound to the many times he had listened for his father\u0027s coming and heard that order. \n \n \"Hello, boys,\" called out the Deacon. \"How are you? Shorty, come out here.\" \n \n Shorty sprang up with something of his old-time alacrity, and Si made an effort to rise, but was too weak. \n \n \"Throw a piece o\u0027 that fat pine on the fire. Shorty,\" said the Deacon, \"and let\u0027s see what I\u0027ve got.\" \n \n By the light of the blazing pine, the Deacon pulled off the cedar boughs and developed his store. The boughs had kept in the heat, so that the food was not yet quite cold, though it had a resinous flavor, from its covering. The Deacon broke one of the cornpones in two and gave half of it to Shorty, with as much as he thought he should have of the meat and vegetables. Then he fed Si, who relished the new diet almost as much as he had relished the chicken broth. The Deacon made a hearty supper himself, and then stored away the rest in his \"cellar\" under the crib, rolling up some more large stones as an additional precaution. \n \n \"Well, you beat me,\" said Shorty admiringly, as he studied over the Deacon\u0027s booty. \"I used to think I was as slick a forager as there was in the army, but I simply ain\u0027t in the same class with a man that kin go out in this Sahara Desert o\u0027 starvation and bring in a four-year-old horse and a wagon-load o\u0027 cooked vittles. I\u0027d never even see the distance pole runnin\u0027 with him. Gen. Rosecrans ought to know you. He\u0027d appoint you Commissary-General o\u0027 the army at once. When I get a little stronger I want you to take me out and learn me the ABC\u0027s o\u0027 foragin\u0027. To think that me and Si wuz grievin\u0027 about your being ketched by the guerrillas. What fools we wuz. It wuz lucky for the guerrillas that you didn\u0027t run acrost \u0027em, for you\u0027d a ketched \u0027em, instid o\u0027 \u0027em you.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s what I come purty nigh doin\u0027,\" chuckled the Deacon. \"But what in the world \u0027m I goin\u0027 to do with that hoss and buckboard? I must hunt around and find that poor beast some corn for tonight. He\u0027s bin driven purty sharp, and he needs his supper jest as bad as I did mine, and I won\u0027t feel right unless he has it. Then I must try to git him back to his owner termorrer.\" \n \n \"If he\u0027s here to-morrer,\" said Shorty, looking at the animal carefully, \"it\u0027ll be a miracle. That\u0027s too good a hoss to be kept in this camp by anybody lower\u0027n a Brigadier-General. The boys\u0027ll steal him, the Captains take him, the Colonels seize him, and the Brigadier-Generals appropriate him for the Government\u0027s service. They\u0027ll call it by different names, but the horse goes all the same. I don\u0027t see how you\u0027re goin\u0027 to keep him till mornin\u0027. You can\u0027t put him in your cellar. If they don\u0027t steal him, it\u0027s because it\u0027s too dark to see him. I\u0027m sorry to say there\u0027s an awful lot o\u0027 thieves in the Army o\u0027 the Cumberland.\" \n \n And Shorty looked very grieved over the deplorable lack of regard in the army for the rights of property. He seemed to mourn this way for several minutes, and then broke out with: \n \n \"Say, Mr. Klegg, I\u0027ve an idee. That Quartermaster o\u0027 the Maumee Muskrats is a sport from way back. He\u0027d give his vary eyes for a good hoss—one that kin beat everybody else\u0027s. The way the horses are run down now this one kin carry a heavy handicap, and beat any one in camp. I\u0027ll bet I kin take this hoss over to him and git $150 in greenbacks for him, for he kin win a bushel o\u0027 money with him the very first day.\" \n \n \"Shorty,\" said the Deacon, in a tone that made that worthy start, \"necessity and the stress o\u0027 circumstances may force me to do many things which are agin my conscience, and for which I shall repent in sackcloth and ashes, if needs be, but I hain\u0027t yit bin reduced to sellin\u0027 stolen property. The Lord save me from that. That hoss and wagon\u0027s got to go back to the owner, if I risk my life in takin\u0027 \u0027em.\" \n \n Shorty wisely kept his reply to himself, but he thought how absurd it was to have men about the army who were too old and set in their ideas to learn army ways. He muttered to himself: \n \n \"If he succeeds in gittin\u0027 that hoss outen camp agin, I\u0027ll expect to see the back o\u0027 my neck, or something else quite as wonderful.\" \n \n The Deacon finally succeeded in getting a couple of ears of corn and a handful of fodder for the horse\u0027s supper, and it was decided that Shorty should watch him the first part of the night, and the Deacon from thence till morning. \n \n As the Deacon pondered over the matter in the early morning hours, he saw that his only chance of getting the horse back was to start with him before daylight revealed him to the men in camp. \n \n Well, I\u0027ll Be Dumbed, Muttered the Deacon. 35 \n \n \"I\u0027ll drive him well outside our lines, and as near to the house as I think it prudent to go, and then turn him loose,\" he said to himself. \"If he\u0027s got the sense o\u0027 the horses up North he\u0027ll go straight home, and then my conscience will be clear. If he don\u0027t, I\u0027ll have done all I could. The Lord don\u0027t ask unreasonable things of us, even in atonement.\" \n \n So he cooked as good a breakfast for the boys as he could prepare from his materials, woke up Shorty and put him in charge, and an hour before daybreak turned the horse\u0027s head toward the pontoon bridge, and started him on a lively trot. \n \n He had only fairly started when a stern voice called out to him from a large tent: \n \n \"Here, you, stop that trotting. What do you mean? Don\u0027t you know that it\u0027s strictly against orders to trot horses in their present condition?\" \n \n \"Excuse me. Captain,\" said the Deacon. \"I\" \n \n \"Blank your Captain,\" roared the voice; \"I\u0027m no Captain.\" \n \n \"Major,\" said the Deacon deprecatingly. \n \n \"To thunder with your Majors, you ignorant fool. You\" \n \n \"I beg your pardon, Colonel. I was\" \n \n \"What\u0027s the matter with you, you ignoramus?\" roared the voice, more indignantly than ever. \"Don\u0027t you know Brigade Headquarters when you see them? Don\u0027t you know your own officers when you hear their voices?\" \n \n \"Rayly, General,\" said the Deacon, much disturbed, \"I didn\u0027t mean to insult you. I\u0027m only a citizen, and a stranger in the camp, and—\" \n \n \"A citizen and a stranger,\" echoed the voice. \"What are you doing in here, anyway? Orderly, bring that man in here till I see him.\" \n \n The Orderly started to obey, when a regiment which had been ordered to report at Headquarters came up at quick step, halted, and ordered arms with much clatter. The frightened horse bounded off down the road, with the Deacon sawing on the lines and trying to stop him. \n \n He only slowed down when he came up near a corral of other horses, to which he turned for companionship and sympathy. \n \n \"Frosty mornin\u0027 makes that hoss purty frisky,\" said the Deacon, as he readjusted his hat, and got himself in shape after his jolting. \"Lucky, though. I didn\u0027t like that old General\u0027s voice. I\u0027m afraid he had it in for me, and would \u0027ve made me trouble for lowerin\u0027 his dignity by callin\u0027 him Captain. Big officers are awfully tetchy.\" \n \n \"Here, who are you? And what are you doin\u0027 out there?\" came the stem inquiry from the dark depths of one of the sheds. \n \n \"Excuse me. General,\" answered the Deacon hastily, \"I\" \n \n \"General? Who are you callin\u0027 General, you fool? Don\u0027t try to be funny with me. You know I\u0027m no General.\" \n \n \"I meant Colonel,\" the Deacon started to explain. \n \n \"The blazes you did. You expect Colonels to run hoss-corrals, and manage mule boarding-houses, do you? stop your blimmed nonsense and answer my questions.\" \n \n \"Major, I was tryin\u0027 to say\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll Major you when I git my boots on and git out there. Don\u0027t think to shut my eye up callin\u0027 me big titles.\" \n \n \"But, Captain.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m no Captain, neither. I\u0027m plain Jim Crimmins, Quartermaster-Sergeant, in charge o\u0027 this corral, that you\u0027re stealin\u0027 around. I\u0027m comin\u0027 out there to break every bone in your body. You infernal sneaks \u0027ve pestered the life out o\u0027 me stealin\u0027 my corn and my mules, even. I\u0027ve bin watchin\u0027 you piroutin\u0027 around in the dark for a long time. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to stop this business if I\u0027ve got to kill every thievin\u0027 varmint in the Army o\u0027 the Cumberland. Don\u0027t you dare move till I come out, or I\u0027ll put a bullet through you. Do you hear?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t believe I\u0027ve got any more time to waste on that bellerin\u0027 bull-calf,\" said the Deacon to himself. He gathered up the lines, turned the horse\u0027s head toward the road, and gave him a lick with a switch, and he dashed off, followed by a couple of shots from Mr. Crimmins, to give color and confirmation to the story that worthy related later in the day of a particularly audacious attempt on the part of sneak thieves to get away with his mules and corn, and which was frustrated by his vigilance and daring. \n \n As the horse slowed down to a walk again a Sergeant of the Guard at the head of a squad stepped out and took him by the reins. \n \n \"Here, who are you, and where are you going so early in the morning?\" he inquired. \n \n \"My name\u0027s Josiah Klegg, sir,\" said the Deacon, prudently ignoring titles. \"I\u0027m from Injianny, and am down here \u0027tendin\u0027 to my son, who belongs to Co. Q, 200th Injianny Volunteers, and who was shot at Chickamaugy. I borryed this hoss and wagon from a man out in the country to bring in some vittles for him and his pardner, and some boughs for \u0027em to sleep on, and I\u0027m takin\u0027 \u0027em back to him.\" \n \n \"Well, that story may be true, and it mayn\u0027t. Probably it ain\u0027t. Men don\u0027t get up before daybreak to take back borrowed horses. You\u0027re up to some devilment; probably taking information or contraband out to the rebels. I haven\u0027t time now to investigate. I\u0027ll put you under guard until I have. As for the horse, we\u0027ve got use for him. McCook\u0027s Cavalry needs about a thousand such as he. We\u0027re out lookin\u0027 for horses now. Unhitch him, boys.\" \n \n The Deacon started to make an earnest protest, but at that moment the rebels on Lookout Mountain made their usual daylight salute to the camp. The size of the squad had attracted their attention, and a shell shrieked over and struck quite near. This was too much for the nervous horse. He made a convulsive leap, which scattered the guards around him and almost threw the Deacon out of the seat. When the latter recovered himself, and got the horse under control again the guards were far away, and he was at the approach to the pontoon bridge. \n \n \"I\u0027ll be plagued,\" mused the Deacon, as the horse moved over the bridge at a slow walk, and gave him time to think, \"the army\u0027s a terrible place. I had no sort o\u0027 trouble when I was doin\u0027 something that mebbe I oughtn\u0027t to have done, but the minute I start out to do a right thing I meet no end o\u0027 difficulties. But these are the obstacles that Satan always puts in the way of the righteous. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to git this boss \u0027back to its owner, or know the reason why. Git up, there.\" \n \n He soon came to a piece of the road which was in full view of the rebels on Lookout Mountain. They had been preparing the day before to stop all travel by that route, and the Deacon\u0027s was the first vehicle that had appeared since they had got their guns planted. They waited until he was fairly out into the open, and sent a shell which struck a panel of the fence off to the left, burst with a crash, and sent rails, chunks, stones and pieces of brush flying through the air. The horse became frantic, and tore up the hill at such a rate the buckboard and harness speedily went to pieces, and the Deacon was flung in the ditch, while the horse galloped wildly over the hill. \n \n The union artillerymen on Moccasin Point had evidently anticipated just such an attempt on the part of the rebels. Instantly a score of guns which had been placed to cover that spot thundered out, and their shells could be seen striking and tearing up the ground all around where the shot came from. Other rebel guns came to the assistance of the first one; the union batteries within reach started in to help their side, and in a minute the whole country was shaking with the uproar. \n \n \"Well, I\u0027ll be dumbed,\" muttered the Deacon, crawling out of the ditch, shaking himself together again, cleaning off the mud, and trying to comprehend what was happening. \"Did anybody ever see sich a commotion kicked up over one four-year-old hoss, and not a particularly good hoss at that? \u0027t\u0027d take a mighty smart man to git as much as $100 for him up in Posey County. Nobody but a Methodist Elder could do it. I\u0027ve sold a better hoss than that for $80, and got all he was worth.\" \n \n He stood for a few minutes and looked at the grand display until the union batteries, satisfied that they had finally quashed the impudent rebel, ceased firing, and then he looked around. \n \n \"Well, that buckboard\u0027s done for. I can\u0027t take it back. It\u0027s only good for kindlin\u0027 wood now. But I may ketch the hoss and take him back.\" \n \n He went up on top of the hill, and saw the horse standing under a tree, apparently pondering over what had happened, and wondering whether he should run farther or remain where he was. \n \n The horse gave him a glad whinney of recognition, as if congratulating him on escaping from the crash of matter. \n \n \"Yes, you beast,\" snorted the Deacon; \"I\u0027m safe, but no thanks to you. You done your best to kick my brains out. Twice your condemned heels jest grazed my eyebrows. All the thanks I git for tryin\u0027 to save you from being starved to death there in Chattanoogy, and git you back home. But you go back home all the same.\" \n \n He led the horse to a rock, mounted him, and started up the road. He reached the point where the road to the house turned off, and was debating whether he should go farther or turn the horse loose there, when he saw a company of cavalry coming up the main road from the other direction—that toward Bridgeport. Though they wore blue overcoats, he had learned enough about army life to not trust this implicitly, so he prudently rode into the woods to watch them until he could make sure. The company came up to where the roads parted, and he overheard a man who rode by the Captain at the head, and who wore a semi-soldier costume and seemed to be a scout or guide, tell the Captain: \n \n \"Their camp\u0027s right over there on that ridge (pointing to the crest on which the Deacon had seen the smoke). They\u0027re probably on the lookout for us, and we\u0027ll have to be very careful if we get near enough to jump them. I thought I saw one of their lookouts about here when we came up. Yes, there he is in there.\" \n \n The Deacon had started to ride boldly toward them when he was sure they were union troops, and a couple of the men, who in their dealings with bushwhackers had learned that it is best to shoot first and ask questions afterward, had promptly fired, and cut twigs uncomfortably near the Deacon\u0027s head. His horse plunged, but he kept him in hand and called out: \n \n \"Hold on! Hello! Don\u0027t do that. I\u0027m a friend. I\u0027m from Injianny.\" \n \n \"You\u0027re a devil of a way from home, and in a bad neighborhood,\" said one of the men who had fired, as he slipped another cartridge into his Sharpe\u0027s. \n \n The Captain interrogated him as to who he was and what he was doing out there, while the scout fidgeted in his saddle over the time that was being wasted. \n \n \"Captain,\" said the scout finally, \"we must hustle if we\u0027re going to strike those fellers before dark. We can\u0027t go down here, but\u0027 ll have to make a long circuit around, so they won\u0027t see us.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s so,\" said the Captain, adjusting himself to start. \n \n \"Captain,\" said one of the men, \"my horse can\u0027t go any farther. He\u0027s been in bad shape, and he fell and broke his knee coming up the hill.\" \n \n \"Well, here, take that citizen\u0027s horse. Old man, get off, and let this man have that horse.\" \n \n The Deacon started to protest, but the man was in a hurry, and almost pulled him off, and slapped his own saddle on in a flash. \n \n \"But what am I do to?\" asked the Deacon bewildered. \n \n \"Do? Do as you please,\" laughed the Captain. \"You are as well off here as anywhere. When a man\u0027s away from home one place\u0027s the same\u0027s another to him. Here, I\u0027ll tell you what you can do. See that cow back there? The boys have been trailing her along, in hopes to get her into Chattanooga and make beef of her. We\u0027ve got to leave her now, for we are going on the jump. We\u0027ll make you a present of her and this broken-down horse. That\u0027ll start you in business. A horse and a cow\u0027s a big start for any man. Good-by. Attention, company! Forward, head of column right—March!\" \n \n \"Well, I\u0027ve done all I could,\" said the Deacon, going back and picking up the rope which was tied to the cow\u0027s horns. \"The Lord knows I\u0027ve tried hard enough to git that hoss back. The cow looks as if she\u0027s a good milker. A little milk\u0027ll do the boys good. Then, they kin have fresh beef. Come along, Bos.\" \n \n Late at night he tied the cow to the corn-crib and went to his weary bed. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63276.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
