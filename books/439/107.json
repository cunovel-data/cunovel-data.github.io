{"id":45142,"no":107,"title":"CHAPTER XX. AFTER THE SKIRMISH","content":"WILD SHOOTING WAS ALL THAT SAVED A SURPRISED COLORED MAN. \\n\\n \\n\\n THOUGH Si and Shorty were certain that the trouble was over and the rebels all gone, it was impossible to convince the boys of this. The sudden appearance of the guerrillas had been so mysterious that they could not rid themselves of the idea that the dark depths beyond the creek were yet filled with vicious foemen animated by dire intents. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si and Shorty gathered the boys together on the bank above the railroad cut, had fires built, posted a few guards, and ordered the rest of the boys to lie down and go to sleep. They set the example by unrolling their own blankets at the foot of a little jack-oat, whose thickly-growing branches, still bearing a full burden of rusty-brown leaves, made an excellent substitute for a tent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Crawl in. Si, and git some sleep,\" said Shorty, filling his pipe. \"I\u0027ll take a smoke and set up for an hour or two. If it looks worth while then, I\u0027ll wake you up and let you take a trick o\u0027 keepin\u0027 awake. But if everything looks all right I\u0027ll jest crawl in beside you and start a snorin\u0027-match.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But neither orders nor example could calm down the nerves of boys who had just had their first experience under fire. There was as little rest for them as for a nest of hornets which had been rudely shaken. They lay down at Si\u0027s order, but the next minute they were buzzing together in groups about the fires, or out with their guns to vantage points on the bank, looking for more enemies. Their excited imaginations made the opposite bank of the creek alive with men, moving in masses, squads and singly, with the sounds of footsteps, harsh commands, and of portentous movements. \\n\\n \\n\\n Two or three times Shorty repressed them and sharply ordered them to lie down and go to sleep. Then he decided to let them wear themselves out, braced his back against a sapling near the fire, pulled out from his pocket the piece of Maria\u0027s dress, and became lost in a swarm of thoughts that traveled north of the Ohio River. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was recalled by Harry Joslyn and Gid Mackall appearing before him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say, Corpril,\" inquired Harry, \"what\u0027s to be done with them rebels over there at the end o\u0027 the bridge?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Them that we shot?\" said Shorty carelessly, feeling around for his tobacco to refill his pipe. \"Nothin\u0027. I guess we\u0027ve done enough for \u0027em already.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t we do nothin\u0027 more?\" repeated Harry. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" answered Shorty, as he rubbed the whittlings from his plug to powder in the hollow of his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just plug at \u0027em as you would at a crow, and then go on your way whistlin\u0027?\" persisted Harry. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly,\" answered Shorty, filling his pipe and looking around for a sliver with which to light it. \"What\u0027re you thinkin\u0027 about?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t hardly know,\" hesitated Harry. \"It seems awful strange just to blaze away at men and then pay no more attention to \u0027em. They mayn\u0027t be knocked out at all—only \u0027possumin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No \u0027possumin\u0027 about them fellers,\" said Shorty sententiously, as he lighted his pipe. \"Feller that gits an ounce o\u0027 lead from a Springfield rifle anywhere in his carkiss don\u0027t play off nor purtend. He\u0027s got something real to occupy his attention, if he\u0027s got any attention left to occupy. You needn\u0027t bother any more about them fellers over there. Their names\u0027s mud. They\u0027re now only part o\u0027 the real estate on the other side o\u0027 the crick. They\u0027re suddently become no good for poll-tax; only to be assessed by the acre.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So you\u0027re sure they can\u0027t do more harm to the bridge?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No more\u0027n the dead leaves on the banks.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I thought,\" persisted Harry, \"that when a man\u0027s killed something had to be done—coroner\u0027s inquest, corpse got ready, funeral, preacher, neighbors gather in, and so on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, you needn\u0027t bother about any obsequies to them fellers over there,\" said Shorty, sententiously, as he pulled away at his pipe. \"You done your whole share when you done the heavy work o\u0027 providin\u0027 the corpses. Let anybody that wants to put on any frills about plantin\u0027 \u0027em. If we have time tomorrow mornin\u0027 and nothin\u0027 better to do, we may go over there and dig holes and put \u0027em in. But most likely we\u0027ll be needed to rebuild that bridge they burnt. I\u0027d rather do that, so\u0027s we kin hurry on to Chattynoogy. Buzzards\u0027ll probably be their undertakers. They\u0027ve got a contract from the Southern Confedrisy for all that work. You lay down and go to sleep. That\u0027s the first dooty of a soldier. You don\u0027t know what may be wanted o\u0027 you tomorrow, and you should git yourselves in shape for anything—fightin\u0027, marchin\u0027 or workin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And sha\u0027n\u0027t we do nothin\u0027 neither to that man that we shot when he was tryin\u0027 to set fire to the train?\" asked little Pete Skidmore, who with Sandy Baker had come up and listened to Shorty\u0027s lecture. \"He\u0027s still layin\u0027 out there where he dropped, awful still. Me and Sandy took a piece o\u0027 fat pine and went down and looked at him. We didn\u0027t go very close. We didn\u0027t like to. He seemed so awful quiet and still.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; you let him alone,\" snapped Shorty impatiently. \"He\u0027ll keep. Lay down and git some sleep, I tell you. What need you bother about a dead rebel? He ain\u0027t makin\u0027 no trouble. It\u0027s the livin\u0027 ones that need lookin\u0027 out for.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys\u0027 looks showed that they were face to face with one of the incomprehensibilities of war. But they lay down and tried to go to sleep, and Shorty\u0027s thoughts returned to Indiana. \\n\\n \\n\\n A shot rang out from the post on which he had stationed Jim Humphreys. He was on his feet in an instant, with his gun in hand, and in the next Si was beside him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s up?\" inquired Si, rubbing his eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothin\u0027, I believe,\" answered Shorty. \"But hold the boys and I\u0027ll go out and see.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He strode forward to Jim\u0027s side and demanded what he had shot at. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I saw some men tryin\u0027 to cross the crick there,\" replied Jim, pointing with his rammer in the direction of the opposite bank. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There, you kin see \u0027em for yourself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see no men,\" said Shorty, after a moment\u0027s scrutiny. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There they are. Don\u0027t you see that white there?\" said Jim, capping his musket for another shot. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That white,\" said Shorty contemptously, \"is some water-birches. They was there when you came on guard, for I noticed \u0027em, and they hain\u0027t moved since. You seen \u0027em then, lookin\u0027 just as they do now. You\u0027re a fool to think you kin see anything white in a rebel. \u0027Taint their color.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care,\" half whimpered Jim. \"Gid Mackall, and Harry Joslyn, and Alf Russell, and Pete Skidmore, and even Sandy Baker, have all shot rebels, and I hain\u0027t hit none. I don\u0027t have half-a-show.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Be patient,\" Shorty consoled him. \"Your three years\u0027s only begun. You\u0027ll have lots o\u0027 chances yit. But if I ketch you shootin\u0027 at any more white birches I\u0027ll tie you up by the thumbs.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty returned to the fire. Si bade the boys he down again, and took his own blanket. Shorty relighted his pipe, took out his never-failing deck of cards and began running them over. \\n\\n \\n\\n Wild Shooting of the Boys Saves The Surprised Colored Man. 273 \\n\\n \\n\\n Jim Humphreys\u0027s shot had given new restlessness to the boys. They did not at all believe in Shorty\u0027s diagnosis of the situation. There must be more men lurking over there whence all that murderous shooting had come only a little while ago. Jim Humphreys was more than probably right. One after another of them quietly slipped away from the fire with his gun and made his way down to Jim Humphreys\u0027s post, which commanded what seemed to be a crossing of the creek. They stood there and scanned the opposite bank of darkness with tense expectancy. They had their ears tuned up to respond to even the rustle of the brown, dry leaves on the trees and the murmur of the creek over the stones. They even saw the white birches move around from place to place and approach the water, but Shorty\u0027s dire threat prevented their firing until they got something more substantial. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s rebels over there, sure as you\u0027re born,\"\u0027 murmured Jim to them, without turning his head to relax his fixed gaze nor taking his finger from the trigger of his cocked gun. \"Wish they\u0027d fire a gun first to convince that old terror of a Corpril, who thinks he kin tell where rebels is just by the smell. I\u0027d—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sh! Jim, I hear a hoss\u0027s hoofs,\" said Harry Joslyn. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sh! so do I,\" echoed Gid Mackall. \\n\\n \\n\\n They all listened with painful eagerness. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hoss\u0027s hoofs and breakin\u0027 limbs, sure\u0027s you\u0027re a foot high,\" whispered Harry. \"And they\u0027re comin\u0027 down the hill this way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. They\u0027re a\u0027most to the crick now,\" assented Gid. \"I\u0027m going to shoot.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; I\u0027ve got the right to a first shot,\" said Jim. \"You fellers hold off.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bang went Jim\u0027s gun, followed almost instantly by the others. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hi, dere, boys; I\u0027s done found you at las\u0027! Whoopee!\" called out a cheery voice from across the creek, and a man rode boldly down to the water\u0027s edge, where the boys were nervously reloading. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, Jim Humphreys, what in blazes are you bangin\u0027 away at now?\" angrily demanded Si, striding up. \"At a cotton-tailed rabbit or a sycamore stump?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The woods is full o\u0027 rebel cavalry comin\u0027 acrost the crick,\" gasped Jim, as he rammed down his cartridge. \"There, you kin see \u0027em for yourself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What foh you come dis-a-way, boys?\" continued the voice of the man on horseback. \"I done los\u0027 you! I fought we done agreed to go ober by Simpson\u0027s hill, an\u0027 I jine you dar. I went dat-a-way, an\u0027 den I hear you shootin\u0027 ober dis-a-way, an\u0027 seed yoh fiah, and I cut acrost to git to you. Whah\u0027d you git so many guns, an\u0027 sich big ones? Sound like sojer guns. I done beared dem way ober dah, an\u0027 I—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hold on, boys,\" sternly shouted Shorty, springing in front of them and throwing up their guns. \"Don\u0027t one o\u0027 you dare shoot! Hold up, I say! Hello, you there! Who are you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who\u0027s me?\" said the negro, astonished by the strange voice. \"I\u0027s Majah Wilkinson\u0027s Sam, Massa Patrol. I\u0027s got a pass all right. De old Majah done tole me I could go out coon-huntin\u0027 wid Kunnel Oberly\u0027s boys tonight, but I done missed dem.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come ashore here, boy,\" commanded Shorty, \"and be thankful that you\u0027re alive. You\u0027ve had a mighty narrow squeak of it. Next time you go out coon huntin\u0027 be sure there\u0027s no Yankee and rebel soldiers huntin\u0027 one another in the neighborhood. Coons have a tough time then.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yankee sojers!\" gasped the negro, as he was led back to the fire, and saw the blue uniforms. \"Lawdy, massy, don\u0027t kill me. I pray, sah, don\u0027t. I hain\u0027t done nuffin. Sho\u0027 I hain\u0027t. Massa said you\u0027d burn me alibe if you eber cotched me, but you won\u0027t, will you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to hurt you,\" said Shorty. \"Sit down there by the fire and git the goose-flesh offen you.\" Then turning to the boys he remarked sarcastically: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fine lot o\u0027 marksmen you are, for a fact. Halfa dozen o\u0027 you bangin\u0027 away at a hundred yards, and not comin\u0027 close enough to a nigger to let him know you was shootin\u0027 at him. Now will you lay down and go to sleep? Here, Si, you take charge o\u0027 this gang and let me go to sleep. I\u0027ve had enough o\u0027 them for one night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n During the night a train came up, carrying a regiment of entirely new troops. In the morning these scattered over the ground, scanning everything with the greatest interest and drinking in every detail of the thrilling events of the previous night. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s just killin\u0027,\" said Si to Shorty, \"to watch the veteran airs our boys are puttin\u0027 on over those new fellers. You\u0027d think they\u0027d fit in every battle since Bunker Hill, and learned Gen. Grant all he knows about tactics. Talk about the way the old fellers used to fill us up, why, these boys lay away over everything we ever knowed. I overheard Harry Joslyn laying it into about 40 of them. \u0027No man knows just what his feelin\u0027s will be under fire until he has the actual experience,\u0027 says he. \u0027Now, the first time I heard a rebel bullet whistle,\u0027 and his face took on a look as if he was trying to recollect something years ago.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" laughed Shorty, \"and you should hear little Pete Skidmore and Sandy Baker lecturing them greenies as to the need o\u0027 lookin\u0027 carefully to their rear and beware o\u0027 rebels sneakin\u0027 \u0027round and attackin\u0027 their trains. Hold on. Look through this brush. There\u0027s Monty Scruggs explainin\u0027 the plan o\u0027 battle to a crowd of \u0027em. He don\u0027t know we\u0027re anywhere around. Listen and you\u0027ll hear something.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The enemy had reached the ground in advance of us,\" Monty was elucidating, in language with which his school histories and the daily papers had familiarized him, \"and had strongly posted himself along those hights, occupying a position of great natural strength, including their own natural cussedness. Their numbers was greatly superior to ours, and they had prepared a cunning trap for us, which we only escaped by the vigilance of Corpril Elliott and the generalship of Serg\u0027t Klegg. I tell you, those men are a dandy team when it comes to running a battle. They know their little biz, and don\u0027t you forget it for a minute. The enemy opened a galling fire, when Corpril Elliott gallantly advanced to that point there and responded, while Serg\u0027t Klegg rapidly arrayed his men along there, and the battle became terrific. It was like the poet says: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Then shook the hills with thunder riven, \\n\\n Then rushed the steeds to battle driven, \\n\\n And louder than the bolts of heaven, \\n\\n Far flashed the red artillery.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, come off, Monty,\" called the more prosaic Gid Mackall; \"you know we didn\u0027t have no artillery. If we\u0027d had, we\u0027d a blowed \u0027em clean offen the hill.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The whistle summoned them to get aboard and move on. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63294.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
