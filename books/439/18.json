FORAGING ON THE WAY","content":"SI HAS SOME VARIED EXPERIENCES WITH SOUTHERN PRODUCTS. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE long chase after Bragg from Louisville to the mountains of southeastern Kentucky was rough on the new troops. It weeded them out very fast, and in every town through which Buell\u0027s army passed the buildings were turned into hospitals and filled with sick and crippled soldiers, who had found out early that they were not physically able to endure the hardships of an active campaign. At the end of two or three weeks some of the new regiments were as much reduced in numbers as most of those that went out in \u002761 were during their first six months. \\n\\n \\n\\n The 200th Ind. jogged along bravely, but its ranks had suffered the common skage. Not less than 400 of its men had fallen by the wayside, and were taking quinine and blue-mass and rubbing arnica on their legs all along the tortuous route. \\n\\n \\n\\n Corporal Si Klegg and his friend Shorty proved to be \"stayers.\" Full of life and ambition, they were always prompt for duty and ready for a fight or a frolic. No one was more quick than Si to offer a suffering comrade the last drop of fresh water in his canteen or give him a lift by carrying his gun a piece. \\n\\n \\n\\n One day the regiment started out for an easy, comfortable day\u0027s march. The coast was clear of rebels, and there being no excuse for crowding on the steam, the boys were allowed to take their own gait, while the horses of the officers and cavalry had a chance to recover their wind. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a warm day late in October. The nights at this time were keen and frosty, but the sun at mid-day still showed much of his Summer vigor. Perspiration flowed freely down the faces of those wandering Hoosiers—faces that were fast assuming the color of half-tanned leather under the influence of sunshine and storm. \\n\\n \\n\\n Once an hour there was the customary halt, when the boys would stretch their legs by the roadside, hitching their knapsacks up under their heads. When the allotted time had expired the bugler blew \"Fall in,\" the notes of which during the next two years became so familiar to the ears of the 200th. Later in \u002764, the Indiana boys mingled their voices with the rest of Sherman\u0027s hundred thousand veterans as they sang: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know you are tired, but still you must go \\n\\n Down to Atlanta to see the big show.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The soldiers were in good spirits. As they marched they fired jests at one another, and laughter rippled along the line. \\n\\n \\n\\n The only thing that troubled them was the emaciated condition of their haversacks, with a corresponding state of affairs in their several stomachs. The Commissary Department was thoroughly demoralized. The supply train had failed to connect, and rations were almost exhausted. There was no prospect that the aching void would be filled, at least, in the regular way, until they reached a certain place, which would not be until the following day. \\n\\n \\n\\n Strict orders against foraging were issued almost daily under the Buell dispensation. These were often read impressively to the new troops, who, in their simplicity, \"took it all in\" as military gospel. \\n\\n \\n\\n The 200th Ind. Was Not Without Talent in Foraging 169 \\n\\n \\n\\n The effect was somewhat depressing upon the ardor with which otherwise they would have pursued the panting pig and the fluttering fowl, and reveled in the orchards and potato-fields. A few irrepressible fellows managed to get a choice meal now and then—just enough to show that the 200th Ind. was not without latent talent in this direction, which only needed a little encouragement to become fruitful of results. \\n\\n \\n\\n But these orders against foraging didn\u0027t hold the soldiers of the crop of 1861. It was like trying to carry water in a sieve. When rations were short, or if they wanted to vary the rather monotonous bill of fare, they always found a way to make up any existing deficiency. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the day in question a few hints were thrown out which resulted in a tacit understanding that, in view of the actual need of the soldiers, if they got a good chance to pick up something the eyes of the officers would be closed. In fact, the officers were as hungry as the men, and hoped to come in for a \"divide.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Soon after starting in the morning a persimmon tree, well laden with fruit, was seen in a field not far from the road. About fifty men started for it on a run, and in five minutes it was as bare as the barren fig tree. \\n\\n \\n\\n The persimmon has some very marked peculiarities. It is a toothsome fruit when well ripened by frost, but if eaten before it has reached the point of full maturity, the effect upon one\u0027s interior is unique and startling. The pungent juices take hold of the mouth and pucker it up in such manner as to make even speech for a time impossible. The tongue seems as if it were tied in a knot. If the juice be swallowed, similar results follow all along its course. But the novice does not often get far enough for that. \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys soon found that the \u0027simmons, although they looked very tempting, were too green to be eaten with any degree of enjoyment. So they filled their pockets with them to pucker up the regiment. \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty had joined in the scramble, telling Si he would bring him a good supply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ain\u0027t them nice?\" he said to Si, holding out three or four of the greenest ones he could find. \"Eat \u0027em; they\u0027re jest gorjus! You can\u0027t help likin\u0027 \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si had never seen any persimmons before. They were certainly tempting to the eye, and he thought they were sent as manna was supplied to the children of Israel in the wilderness. \\n\\n \\n\\n Eagerly seizing them, Si tossed one into his mouth and began to chew it with great vigor. The persimmon got in its work at once. It took hold with a mighty grip, wrinkling him up like the skins on scalded milk. \\n\\n \\n\\n After sputtering vigorously a few minutes, while Shorty laughed at him. Si managed to get his tongue untwisted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said he, \"them things is nice—in a horn! \u0027Twouldn\u0027t take many of \u0027em to make a meal!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A little farther on Si\u0027s quick eye noticed a row of beehives standing on a bench in the yard of one of the natives. Si had a weakness for honey. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shorty,\" said he, \"see them hives over there? How\u0027d ye like to have some honey for supper?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty \"allowed\" that it would be a good thing. Si stopped and waited a few minutes until his own regiment got past, thinking his plan would be less liable to interruption. Then he leaped over the fence, went up to the hives, and boldly tipped one of them over, hoping he could get out a comb or two, fill up his coffee-kettle, and effect his retreat before the bees really found out what he was up to. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the bees instantly rallied their forces and made a vigorous assault upon the invader. Si saw that it would be too hot for him, and without standing upon the order of his going he went at once, in a decidedly panicky state of mind. The bees made the most of their opportunity, using their \"business ends\" on him with great activity and zeal. They seemed to fully\u0027 share the common feeling in the South toward the \"Yanks.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si Beat a Retreat 171 \\n\\n \\n\\n A pretty woman, standing on the porch, had watched Si\u0027s raid from the doorway. As he fell back in utter rout she screamed \"Sarves ye right!\" and then sat down on the doorstep and laughed till she cried. She enjoyed it as much as the bees did. \\n\\n \\n\\n The latter took hold of Si in various places, and by the time he had caught up with the regiment one eye was closed, and there was a big lump on his nose, besides several more stings which the bees had judiciously distributed about his person. It was very evident that he had been overmatched and had come out second best in the encounter. \\n\\n \\n\\n Corporal Klegg presented a picturesque appearance as he reached Co. Q. The boys fairly yelled with delight. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Whar\u0027s yer honey?\" said Shorty. \"Pears like ye waked up the wrong passenger that time!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si laughed with the rest, rubbed salt on his stings, and plodded on, consoling himself with the thought that his was not the only case in which the merit of earnest effort had gone unrewarded. \\n\\n \\n\\n Soon after noon the 200th came to a large patch of sweet potatoes. Si and Shorty, as well as a good many of the rest, thought it would be a good place to lay in a supply for supper, as they might not have another So good a chance. From all parts of the column the men, by dozens dashed into the field. In a moment there was a man at every hill, digging away with his bayonet, and chucking the tempting tubers into his haversack. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n 173 (74K) \\n\\n \\n\\n THERE WAS A MAN AT EVERY HILL \\n\\n \\n\\n Two hours before going into camp the regiment passed a small spring, around which a crowd of soldiers were struggling to fill their canteens. There had been a long stretch without fresh water, and Si thought he would supply himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gimme your canteen, too, Shorty, and I\u0027ll fill it!\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here, Si, you\u0027re a bully boy, take mine!\" \"Mine, too!\" \"And mine!\" said one after another of his comrades. Si good naturedly complied and they loaded him down with about 20 canteens. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si Being Worked for a \u0027good Thing.\u0027 175 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right,\" said Si, \"I\u0027ll be along with \u0027em full d\u0027reckly!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He had to wait for his turn at the spring, and by the time he had filled all the canteens he was half an hour behind. Slinging them around his neck he started on, with just about as big a load as he could carry. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si forged ahead, gradually gaining a little, through the tardy movement of the column that generally preceded going into camp. The canteen straps chafed his shoulders, his back ached, and perspiration streamed from every pore. The smoke of the campfires ahead told that the end of the day\u0027s march was near. He kept on and finally came up with Co. Q just as the 200th was stacking arms on the bank of a clear stream. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si threw down his burdens of canteens, himself thoroughly blown and well-nigh exhausted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Purty good load, wasn\u0027t it, Si?\" said Shorty. \"But what made ye lug all that water in here? When ye saw they was goin\u0027 into camp ahead ye might ha\u0027 knowed there was plenty o\u0027 water. Why in blazes didn\u0027t ye turn the water out o\u0027 them \u0027ere canteens?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be hanged if I thought o\u0027 that!\" said Si, while the boys joined in a hearty laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n At the command \"Break ranks\" there was a general scamper to engage in the work of getting supper and preparing to spend the night with as much comfort as possible. The members of each mess scattered in all directions for water, rails, straw, etc., while some went out to scour the adjacent region for edibles. \\n\\n \\n\\n These exercises the soldiers always entered into with the heartiest gusto, and the scene will be well remembered by all those who marched. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si threw off his traps and dropped on the ground to rest a few minutes. He got up presently to scratch around with the rest. As he took hold of his haversack he was surprised at its lightness. When he laid it down it was bulging out with sweet potatoes, and a glance showed him that these were all gone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dern my buttons!\" exclaimed Si, as he forgot his weariness, and his eyes flashed fire. \"If I am a Corporal, I kin jest mash the feller that stole my \u0027taters, I don\u0027t keer if he\u0027s ten foot high. Won\u0027t somebody show \u0027im to me? There won\u0027t be \u0027nuff of \u0027im left to hold a fun\u0027ral over?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si pranced around in a high state of inflammation, and it is probable that if he had found the purloiner of his provender there would have been a harder fight than any that occurred between Buell and Bragg. \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys winked slyly at one another, and all said it was too bad. It was a startling case of turpitude, and Si determined to have revenge by getting even with some other fellow, without pausing to consider the questions of moral philosophy involved. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come \u0027long with me. Shorty!\" he said to his friend, and they strode away. Just outside the camp they came upon two members of some other new regiment coming into camp with a fine pig slung over a pole and two or three chickens in their hands. Shorty suggested to Si that this was a good chance for him to even up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Halt, there!\" shouted Si to the foragers. \"We\u0027re sent out to pick up such fellows as you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The effect was like a discharge from a masked battery. The men dropped their plunder and fled in wild confusion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Take hold \u0027o that pole, Shorty!\" said Si, and laying it upon their shoulders they made a triumphant entry into camp. \\n\\n \\n\\n There seemed to be no danger of immediate starvation in the ranks of the 200th. Each man appeared to have supplied himself during the day. On every hand fires gleamed brightly in the gathering twilight, and around them crowded the hungry soldiers, intent upon the simple culinary processes incident to the evening meal. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63205.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
