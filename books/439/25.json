{"id":45060,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER I. THROUGH MUD AND MIRE","content":"DUTY\u0027S PATH LEADS THE 200TH IND. SOUTHWARD FROM NASHVILLE. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"SHORTY\" said Si Klegg, the morning after Christmas, 1862, as the 200th Ind. sullenly plunged along through the mud and rain, over the roads leading southward from Nashville, \"they say that this is to be a sure-enough battle and end the war.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your granny\u0027s night-cap they do,\" answered Shorty crossly, as he turned his cap around back ward to stop the icy current from chasing down his backbone. \"How many thousand times \u0027s that bin stuffed into your ears? This is the forty-thousandth mile we\u0027ve marched to find that battle that was goin\u0027 to end the war. And I\u0027ll bet we\u0027ll march 40,000 more. This war ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to end till we\u0027ve scuffed the top off all the roads in Kentucky and Tennessee, and wore out God\u0027s patience and all the sole-leather in the North. I believe it\u0027s the shoe-makers that\u0027s runnin\u0027 this war in the interest o\u0027 their business.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The cold, soaking rain had reduced the most of the 200th Ind. to a mood when they would have 16disputed the Ten Commandments and quarreled with their mothers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s no use bein\u0027 crosser\u0027n a saw-buck, if you are wet, Shorty,\" said Si, walking to the side of the road and scraping off his generous-sized brogans several pounds of stiff, red mud. \"They say this new General with a Dutch name is a fighter from Wayback, an\u0027 he always licks the rebels right out of their boots. I\u0027m sure, I hope it\u0027s so. I like huntin\u0027 ez well ez anybody, an\u0027 I\u0027ll walk ez fur ez the next man to find something to shoot. But I think walkin\u0027 over two States, backward and forward, is altogether too much huntin\u0027 for so little shootin\u0027. Don\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" snapped Shorty. \"You\u0027ll git all the shootin\u0027 you want before your three years are up. It\u0027ll keep.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But why keep it so long?\" persisted Si. \"If it can be done up in three months, an\u0027 we kin git back home, why dribble it out over three years? That ain\u0027t the way we do work back home on the Wabash.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Confound back home on the Wabash,\" roared Shorty. \"I don\u0027t hear nothin\u0027 else, day and night, but \u0027back home on the Wabash.\u0027 I\u0027ve bin on the Wabash, an\u0027 I don\u0027t want to never see the measly, muddy, agery ditch agin\u0027. Why, they have the ager so bad out there that it shakes the buttons off a man\u0027s clothes, the teeth out of his head, the horns off the cows. An\u0027 as for milk-sickness.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shorty!\" thundered Si, \"stop right there. If you wasn\u0027t my pardner I\u0027d fight you this minute. I kin join in jawin\u0027 about the officers an\u0027 the 17Government. A great deal of your slack that I can\u0027t agree with I kin put up with, but you mustn\u0027t say nothin\u0027 against my home in the Wabash Valley. That I won\u0027t stand from no man. For fear that I may lose my temper I\u0027m goin\u0027 away from you till you\u0027re in better humor.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With that Si strode on ahead, feeling as cross and uncomfortable internally as he was ill-at-ease externally. He hated above all things to quarrel with Shorty, but the Wabash Valley, that gardenspot of earth, that place where lived his parents, and sister, and Annabel but the subject was too sore to think about. \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently an Aid came galloping along the middle of the road, calling upon the men to make way for him. His horse\u0027s hoofs threw the mud in every direction, and Si caught a heavy spatter directly in his face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Confound them snips of Aids,\" said he angrily, as he wiped the mud off. \"Put on more airs than if they was old Gen. Scott himself. Always pretend to be in such a powerful hurry. Everybody must hustle out of their way. I think that fool jest did that on purpose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The rain kept pouring down with tormenting persistence. Wherever Si looked were drenched, de pressed-looking men; melancholy, steaming horses; sodden, gloomy fields; yellow, rushing streams, and boundless mud that thousands of passing feet were churning into the consistency of building-mortar. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si had seen many rainy days since he had been in the army, but this was the first real Winter rain 18he had been out in. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jabe Belcher, the most disagreeable man in Co. Q, was just ahead of him. He stepped into a mudpuddle, slipped, threw the mud and water over Si, and his gun, which he flung in the effort to save himself, struck Si on the shoulder. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Aid Spatters Mud on si 18 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Clumsy lunkhead!\" roared Si, as ill-tempered now as anybody. \"Couldn\u0027t you see that puddle and keep out of it? You\u0027d walk right into the Cumberland River if it was in front of you. Never saw such a bat-eyed looney in my life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If the Captain wasn\u0027t lookin\u0027,\" retorted Belcher, \"I\u0027d shut up both of them dead-mackerel eyes o\u0027 your\u0027n, you backwoods yearlin\u0027. I\u0027ll settle with you after we git into camp. Your stripes won\u0027t save you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never mind about my stripes, old Stringhalt. I kin take them off long enough to wallop you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si was in such a frame of mind that his usual open-eyedness was gone. The company was wading across a creek, and Si plunged in without a thought. He stepped on a smooth stone, his feet went from under him and he sat \u0027down hard and waist-deep in much the coldest water that he ever remembered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, Greenland\u0027s icy mountains,\" was all that he could think to say. \\n\\n \\n\\n The other boys yelled: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come on to camp, Si. That\u0027s no place to sit down.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Feet hurt, Si, and goin\u0027 to rest a little?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This your day for taking a bath, Si?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thinks this is a political meetin\u0027, and he\u0027s to take the chair.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Place Rest!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When I sit down, I prefer a log or a rail; but some men\u0027s different.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"See a big bass there, Si, an\u0027 try to ketch him by settin\u0027 down on him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Git up, Si; git up, an\u0027 give your seat to some lady.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si Sat Down Hard 20 \\n\\n \\n\\n Si was too angry to notice their jibes. He felt around in the icy water for his gun, and clambered out on the bank. He first poured the water out of his gun-barrel and wiped the mud off. His next thought was the three days\u0027 rations he had drawn 20 that morning. He opened his haversack, and poured out the water it had caught. With it went his sugar, coffee and salt. His hardtack was a pasty mess; his meat covered with sand and dirt. He turned the haversack inside out, and swashed it out in the stream. \\n\\n \\n\\n Back came Capt. McGillicuddy, with water streaming from the down-turned rim of his hat, and his humor bad. He was ignorant of Si\u0027s mishap. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Corporal Klegg, what are you doing back here? Why aren\u0027t you in your place? I\u0027ve been looking all around for you. The company wagon\u0027s stalled back somewhere. That spavin-brained teamster\u0027s at his old tricks. I want you to take five men off the rear of the company, go back and find that wagon, and bring it up. Be smart about it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Captain,\" remonstrated Si, \"I\u0027m wetter\u0027n a drowned rat!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, who in thunder ain\u0027t?\" exploded the Captain. \"Do I look as dry as a basket of chips? Am I walking around in a Panama and linen clothes? Did you expect to keep from getting your feet wet when you came into the army? I want none of your belly-aching or sore-toeing. You take five men and bring up that wagon in a hurry. Do you hear me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And the Captain splashed off through the red mud to make somebody else still more miserable. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si picked up his wet gun from the rain-soaked sod, put it under his streaming overcoat, ordered the five drenched, dripping, dejected boys near him to follow, and plunged back into the creek, which had by this time risen above his knees. He was past the stage of anger now. He simply wished that he was dead and out of the whole business. A nice, dry grave on a sunny hillock in Posey County, with a good roof over it to keep out the rain, would be a welcome retreat. \\n\\n \\n\\n In gloomy silence he and his squad plodded back through the eternal mud and the steady downpour, through the miry fields, through the swirling yellow floods in the brooks and branches, in search of the laggard company wagon.22 \\n\\n \\n\\n Two or three miles back they came upon it, stuck fast in a deep mud-hole. The enraged teamster was pounding the mules over the head with the butt of his blacksnake whip, not in the expectation of getting any further effort out of them he knew better than that but as a relief to his overcharged heart. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stop beatin\u0027 them mules over the head,\" shouted Si, as they came up. Not that he cared a fig about the mules, but that he wanted to \"jump\" somebody. \\n\\n \\n\\n Stop Beatin\u0027 Them Mules\u0027 22 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go to brimstone blazes, you freckle-faced Posey County refugee,\" responded Groundhog, the teamster, in the same fraternal spirit. \"I\u0027m drivin\u0027 this here team.\" He gave the nigh-swing mule a \"welt\" that would have knocked down anything else than a swing mule. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you don\u0027t stop beatin\u0027 them mules, by thunder, I\u0027ll make you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Make\u0027s a good word,\" responded Groundhog, giving the off-swing mule a wicked \"biff.\" \"I never see anything come out of Posey County that could make me do what I didn\u0027t want to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si struck at him awkwardly. He was so hampered by his weight of soggy clothes that there was little force or direction to his blow. The soaked teamster returned the blow with equal clumsiness. \\n\\n \\n\\n The other boys came up and pulled them apart. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We ain\u0027t no time for sich blamed nonsense,\" they growled. \"We\u0027ve got to git this here wagon up to the company, an\u0027 we\u0027ll have the devil\u0027s own time doin\u0027 it. Quit skylarkin\u0027 an\u0027 git to work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They looked around for something with which to make pries. Every rail and stick within a quarter of a mile of the road was gone. They had been used up the previous Summer, when both armies had passed over the road. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was nothing to do but plod off through mud and rain to the top of a hill in the distance, where there was a fence still standing. A half an hour later each of the six came back with a heavy rail on his shoulder. They pried the wagon out and got it started, only to sink again in another quagmire a few hundred yards further on. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si and the boys went back to get their rails, but found that they had been carried off by another squad that had a wagon in trouble. There was nothing to do but to make another toilsome journey to the fence for more rails. \\n\\n \\n\\n After helping the wagon out they concluded it24 would be wiser to carry their rails with them a little way to see if they would be needed again. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were many times that afternoon. As dark ness came on Si, who had the crowning virtue of hopefulness when he fully recognized the unutterable badness of things, tried to cheer the other boys up with assertions that they would soon get into camp, where they would find bright, warm fires with which to dry their clothes, and plenty of hot coffee to thaw them out inside. \\n\\n \\n\\n The quick-coming darkness added enormously to the misery of their work. For hours they struggled along the bottomless road, in the midst of a ruck of played-out mules and unutterably tired, disgusted men, laboring as they were to get wagons ahead. \\n\\n \\n\\n Finally they came up to their brigade, which had turned off the road and gone into line-of-battle in an old cotton-field, where the mud was deeper, if possible, than in the road. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the 200th Ind.?\" called out Si. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here, Si,\" Shorty\u0027s voice answered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the fires, Shorty,\" asked Si, with sinking heart. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ain\u0027t allowed none,\" answered his partner gloomily. \"There\u0027s a rebel battery on that hill there, and they shoot every time a match is lighted. What\u0027ve you got there, a rail? By George, that\u0027s lucky! We\u0027ll have something to keep us out of the mud.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They laid down the rail and sat upon it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shorty,\" said Si, as he tried to arrange his aching bones to some comfort on the rail, \"I got mad at you for cussin\u0027 the Wabash this morning. I ain\u0027t a fluid talker such as you are, an\u0027 I can\u0027t find words to say25 what I think. But I jest wisht you would begin right here and cuss everybody from Abe Lincoln down to Corporal Si Klegg, and everything from the Wabash in Injianny down to the Cumberland in Tennessee. I\u0027d like to listen to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63212.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
