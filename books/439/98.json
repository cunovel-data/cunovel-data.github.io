{"id":45133,"no":98,"title":"CHAPTER XI. SHORTY RUNS HEADQUARTERS","content":"GETS ENTIRELY TOO BIG FOR HIS PLACE. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE disturbance in the Deacon\u0027s family when Shorty\u0027s note was delivered by little Sammy Woggles quite came up to that romance-loving youth\u0027s fond anticipations. If he could only hope that his own disappearance would create a fraction of the sensation he would have run away the next day. It would be such a glorious retribution on those who subjected him to the daily tyranny of rising early in the morning, washing his face, combing his hair, and going to school. For the first time in his life the boy found himself the center of interest in the family. He knew something that all the rest were intensely eager to know, and they plied him with questions until his young brain whirled. He told them all that he knew, except that which Shorty had enjoined upon him not to tell, and repeated his story without variation when separately examined by different members of the family. All his leisure for the next few days was put in laboriously constructing, on large sheets of foolscap, the following letter, in which the thumb-marks and blots were more conspicuous than the \"pot-hook\" letters: \\n\\n \\n\\n dEER shoRty: \\n\\n \\n\\n doNt 4git thAt REblE guN u promist mE. \\n\\n \\n\\n thAir wAs An oRful time wheN i giv um yorE lEttEr. \\n\\n \\n\\n missis klEgg shE cride. \\n\\n \\n\\n mAriAr shE sEd did u EvEr No Ennything so Ridiklus. \\n\\n \\n\\n si hE sed thAt shorty kood be morE Kinds ov fool in A minnit \\n\\n thAn Ary uthEr boy hE Ever node, Not bArrin Tompsons colt. \\n\\n \\n\\n thE deAcon hE wAntid 2 go 2 the tranE \u0026 stop u.

Shorty became anxious about that letter from Sammy, and after much scheming and planning, he at last bethought himself of the expedient of having the Chief Clerk write an official letter to Sam Elkins, the postmaster and operator at Bean Blossom Creek Station, directing him to forward to Headquarters any communications addressed to Corp\u0027l Elliott, 200th Ind. Vols., and keep this matter a military secret. \\n\\n \\n\\n In spite of his prepossessions against it, Shorty took naturally to Headquarters duty, as he did to everything else in the army. He even took a pride in his personal appearance, and appeared every morning as spick and span as the barber-shop around the corner could make him. This was because the General saw and approved it, and—because of the influence Maria had projected into his life. The Deacon\u0027s well-ordered home had been a revelation to him of another world, of which he wanted to be a part. The gentle quiet and the constant consideration for others that reigned there smoothed off his rough corners and checked the rasping of his ready tongue. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to try to be half-white,\" he mentally resolved; \"at least, as long\u0027s I\u0027m north o\u0027 the Ohio River. When I\u0027m back agin at the front, I kin take a rest from being respectable.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He was alert, prompt, and observant, and before he was himself aware of it began running things about the ante-rooms to Headquarters. More and more the General and Chief Clerk kept putting the entire disposal of certain matters in his hands, and it was not surprising that he acted at times as if he were the Headquarters himself, and the General and others merely attaches. Shorty always had that way about him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, you can\u0027t see the General today,\" he would say to a man as to whom he had heard the General or the Chief Clerk hint was a bore, and wasted their time. \"The General\u0027s very busy. The President\u0027s layin\u0027 down on him for his advice about a campaign to take Richmond by a new way, and the General\u0027s got to think at the rate of a mile a minute in order to git it off by telegraph.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Don\u0027t You Know Better Than to Come To Headquarters Like That? 156 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here,\" to a couple of soldiers who came up to get their furloughs extended, \"don\u0027t you know better than to come to Headquarters looking as if your clothes had been blowed on to you? How long\u0027ve you bin in the army? Hain\u0027t you learned yit that you must come to Headquarters in full dress? Go back and git your shoes blacked, put on collars, button up your coats, and come up here lookin\u0027 like soldiers, not teamsters on the Tullyhomy mud march.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" very decisively, to a big-waisted, dark-bearded man; \"you can\u0027t git no permit here to open no shebang in camp or anywheres near. Too many like you out there now. We\u0027re goin\u0027 to root \u0027em all out soon. They\u0027re all sellin\u0027 whisky on the sly, and every last one of \u0027em orter be in jail.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly, madam,\" tenderly to a poor woman who had come to see if she could learn something of her son, last heard from as sick in hospital at Chattanooga. \"Sit down. Take that chair—no, that one; it\u0027s more comfortable. Give me your son\u0027s name and regiment. I\u0027ll see if we kin find out anything about him. No use seein\u0027 the General. I\u0027ll do jest as well, and \u0027ll tend to it quicker.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" to a raw Captain, who strolled in, smoking a cheap cheroot. \"The General\u0027s not in to an officer who comes in here like as if Headquarters was a ward caucus. He\u0027ll be in to you when you put on your sword and button up your coat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It amused and pleased the General to see Shorty take into his hands the administration of military etiquette; but one day, when he was accompanying the General on a tour of inspection, and walking stiffly at the regulation distance behind, a soldier drunk enough to be ugly lurched past, muttering some sneers about \"big shoulder-straps.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty instantly snatched him by the collar and straightened him up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Take the position of a soldier,\" he commanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n The astonished man tried to obey. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Throw your chest out,\" commanded Shorty, punching him in the ribs. \"Little fingers down to the seams of your pants,\" with a cuff at his ears. \"Put your heels together, and turn out your toes,\" kicking him on the shin. \"Hold up your head,\" jabbing him under the chin. \"\u0027Now respectfully salute.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The cowed man clumsily obeyed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, take that to learn you how to behave after this in the presence of a General officer,\" concluded Shorty, giving him a blow in the face that sent him over. \\n\\n \\n\\n The General had walked on, apparently without seeing what was going on. But after they had passed out of the sight of the group which the affair had gathered, he turned and said to Shorty: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Corporal, discipline must be enforced in the army, but don\u0027t you think you were a little too summary and condign with that man?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hardly know what you mean by summary and condign. General, But if you mean warm by summary, I\u0027ll say that he didn\u0027t git it half hot enough. If I\u0027d had my strength back I\u0027d a\u0027 condigned his head off. But he got his lesson jest when he needed it, and he\u0027ll be condigned sure to behave decently hereafter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Just then ex-Lieut.-Col. Billings came by. He was dressed in citizen\u0027s clothes, and he glared at Shorty and the General, but there was something in the latter\u0027s face and carriage which dominated him in spite of himself, his camp associations asserted themselves, and instinctively his hand went to his hat in a salute. \\n\\n \\n\\n This was enough excuse for Shorty. He fell back until the General was around the corner, out of sight, and then went up to Billings. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mister Billings,\" said he, sternly, \"what was the General\u0027s orders about wearin\u0027 anything military?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Outrageously tyrannical and despotic,\" answered Billings hotly. \"But jest what you might expect from these Abolition satraps, who\u0027re throttlin\u0027 our liberties. A white man\u0027s no longer got any rights in this country that these military upstarts is bound to respect. But I\u0027m obeyin\u0027 the order till I kin git an appeal from it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re a liar. You\u0027re not,\" said Shorty, savagely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, what in the world have I got on that\u0027s military?\" asked Billings, looking himself over. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re wearin\u0027 a military saloot, which you have no business to. You\u0027ve got no right to show that you ever was in the army, or so much as seen a regiment. You salooted the General jest now. Don\u0027t you ever let me see you do it to him agin, or to no other officer. You musn\u0027t do nothin\u0027 but take off your hat and bow. You hear me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty was rubbing it in on his old tormentor in hopes to provoke him to a fight. But the cowed man was too fearful of publicity just then. He did not know what might be held in reserve to spring upon him. He shambled away, muttering: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, go on! Grind down upon me. You\u0027ll be wantin\u0027 to send me to a Lincoln bastile next. But a day will come when white men\u0027ll have their rights agin.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Unfortunately for Shorty, however, he was having things too much his own way. There were complaints that he was acting as if he owned Headquarters. \\n\\n \\n\\n Even the General noticed it, and would occasionally say in tones of gentle remonstrance: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"See here, Corporal, you are carrying too big a load. Leave something for the rest of us to do. We are getting bigger pay than you are, and should have a chance to earn our money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Shorty would not take the hint. With his rapidly-returning strength there had come what Si termed \"one of his bull-headed spells,\" which inevitably led to a cataclysm, unless it could be worked off legitimately, as it usually was at the front by a toilsome march, a tour of hard fatigue duty, or a battle or skirmish. But the routine of Headquarters duties left him too much chance to get \"fat and sassy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n One day the General and his staff had to go over to Louisville to attend some great military function, and Shorty was left alone in charge of Headquarters. There was nothing for him to do but hold a chair down, and keep anybody from carrying off the Headquarters. This was a dangerous condition, in his frame of mind. He began meditating how he could put in the idle hours until the General should return in the evening. He thought of hunting up Billngs, and giving him that promised thrashing, but his recent experience did not promise hopefully that he could nag that worthy into a fight that would be sufficiently interesting. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027d probably hit him a welt and he\u0027d go off bawlin\u0027 like a calf,\" he communed with himself. \"No; Billings is too tame, now, until he finds out whether we\u0027ve got anything on him to send him to the penitentiary, where he orter go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Looking across the street he noticed Eph Click, whom he had known as a camp-follower down in Tennessee, and was now running a \"place\" in the unsavory part of the town. Shorty had the poorest opinion of Eph, but the latter was a cunning rascal, who kept on the windy side of the law, and had so far managed to escape the active notice of the Provost-Marshal. He was now accompanied by a couple of men in brand-new uniforms, so fresh that they still had the folds of the Quartermaster\u0027s boxes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There goes that unhung rascal, Eph Glick,\" he said to himself, \"that orter be wearin\u0027 a striped suit, and breakin\u0027 stone in the penitentiary. He\u0027s runnin\u0027 a reg\u0027lar dead-fall down the street, there, and he\u0027s got a couple o\u0027 green recruits in tow, steerin\u0027 them to where he kin rob \u0027em of their pay and bounty. They won\u0027t have a cent left in two hours. I\u0027ve bin achin\u0027 to bust him up for a long time, but I\u0027ve never bin able to git the p\u0027ints on him that\u0027d satisfy the General or the Provo. I\u0027ll jest go down and clean out his shebang and run him out o\u0027 town, and finish the job up while the General and the Provo\u0027s over in Louisville. It\u0027ll all be cleaned up before they git back, and they needn\u0027t know a word of it. Eph\u0027s got no friends around here to complain. He\u0027s a yaller hound, that nobody cares what\u0027s done to him. It\u0027ll be good riddance o\u0027 bad rubbish.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He stalked out of the Headquarters, and beckoned imperiously to a squad that he saw coming down the street under the command of a Sergeant. Seeing him come out of Headquarters there was no question of his right to order, and the Sergeant and squad followed. \\n\\n \\n\\n They arrived in front of Eph\u0027s place about the same time he did. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Take that man,\" said Shorty, pointing to Eph, \"and put him aboard the next train that goes out. Think yourself lucky, sir, that you git off so easily. If you ever show your face back here agin you\u0027ll be put at hard labor on the fortifications for the rest o\u0027 your natural life. Hustle him off to the depot, a couple of you, and see that he goes off when the train does. The rest o\u0027 you bring out all the liquor in that place, and pour it into the gutter. Sergeant, see that nobody\u0027s allowed to drink or carry any away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Nothing more was needed for the crowd that had followed up the squad, anticipating a raid. Bottles, demijohns and kegs were smashed, the cigars and tobacco snatched up, and the place thoroughly wrecked in a few minutes. \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty contemplated the ruin from across the street, and strolled back to Headquarters, serenely conscious of having put in a part of the day to good advantage. \\n\\n \\n\\n That evening the Provost-Marshal came into Headquarters, and said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, General, that you felt that Click place so bad that you were compelled to take personal action. I have known for some time that something ought to be done, but I\u0027ve been trying to collect evidence that would hold Glick on a criminal charge, so that I could turn him over to the civil authorities.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do not understand what you mean, Colonel,\" answered the General. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I mean that Glick place that was raided by your orders today.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I gave no orders to raid any place. I have left all those matters in your hands, Colonel, with entire confidence that you would do the right thing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, one of my Sergeants reported that a Corporal came from your Headquarters, and directed the raid to be made.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A Corporal from my Headquarters?\" repeated the General, beginning to understand. \"That\u0027s another development of that irrepressible Shorty.\" And he called: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Corp\u0027l Elliott.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" responded Shorty, appearing at the door and saluting. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you raid the establishment of a person named\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eph Glick,\" supplied the Provost-Marshal. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Ephraim Glick. Did you direct it; and, if so, what authority had you for doing so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" said Shorty promptly. \"I done it on my own motion. It was a little matter that needed tending to, and I didn\u0027t think it worth while to trouble either you or the Provo about it. The feller\u0027s bin dead-ripe for killin\u0027 a long time. I hadn\u0027t nothin\u0027 else to do, so I thought I\u0027d jest git that job offen my hands, and not to have to think about it any more.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Corporal,\" said the General sternly, \"I have not objected to your running my office, for I probably need all the help in brains and activity that I can get. But I must draw the line at your assuming the duties of the Provost-Marshal in addition. He is quite capable of taking care of his own office. You have too much talent for this narrow sphere. Gen. Thomas needs you to help him run the army. Tell Wilson to make out your transportation, so that you can start for your regiment tomorrow. The Provost-Marshal and I will have to try to run this town without your help. It will be hard work, I know; but, then, that is what we came into the service for.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty grumbled to another Orderly as he returned to his place in the next room: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There, you see all the thanks you git for bein\u0027 a hustler in the way of doin\u0027 your dooty. I done a job for \u0027em that they should\u0027ve \u0027tended to long ago, and now they sit down on me for it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63285.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
