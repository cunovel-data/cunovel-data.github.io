You\u0027re a soldier now, and soldiers don\u0027t cry. Stop it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dod durn it,\" blubbered Pete, \"I ain\u0027t cryin\u0027 bekase Pm skeered. I\u0027m cryin\u0027 bekase I\u0027m afeared you\u0027ll lose me. I know durned well you\u0027ll lose me yit, with all this foolin\u0027 around.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, we won\u0027t,\" Si assured him. \"You just keep with us and you\u0027ll be all right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here, you blim-blammed, moon-eyed suckers, git offen that \u0027ere crossin\u0027,\" yelled at them a fireman whose engine came tearing down toward the middle of the squad. \"Hain\u0027t you got no more sense than to stand on a crossin\u0027?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He hurled a chunk of coal at the squad, which hastily followed Si to the other side of the track. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hello, there; where are you goin\u0027, you chuckle-headed clodhoppers?\" yelled the men on another train rushing down from a different direction. \"This ain\u0027t no hayfield. Go back home and drive cows, and git out o\u0027 the way o\u0027 men who\u0027re at work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was more scurrying, and when at last Si reached a clear space, he had only a portion of his squad with him, while Shorty was vowing he would not go a step farther until he had licked a railroad man. But the engines continued to whirl back and forth in apparently purposeless confusion, and the moment that he fixed upon any particular victim of his wrath, he was sure to be compelled to jump out of the way of a locomotive clanging up from an unexpected direction and interposing a train of freight cars between him and the man he was after. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si was too deeply exercised about getting his squad together to pay attention to Shorty or the jeering, taunting railroaders. He became very fearful that some of them had been caught and badly hurt, probably killed, by the remorseless locomotives. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This\u0027s wuss\u0027n a battle,\" he remarked to the boys around him. \"I\u0027d ruther take you out on the skirmish-line than through them trains agin.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n However, he had come to get some comprehension of the lay of the ground and the movements of the trains by this time, and by careful watching succeeded in gathering in his boys, one after another, until he had them all but little Pete Skidmore. The opinion grew among them that Pete had unwisely tried to keep up with the bigger boys, who had jumped across the track in front of a locomotive, and had been caught and crushed beneath the wheels. He had been seen up to a certain time, and then those who were last with him had been so busy getting out of the way that they had forgotten to look for him. Si calmed Shorty down enough to get him to forget the trainmen for awhile and take charge of the squad while he went to look for Pete. He had become so bewildered that he could not tell the direction whence they had come, or where the tragedy was likely to have happened. The farther he went in attempting to penetrate the maze of moving trains, the more hopeless the quest seemed. Finally he went over to the engineer of a locomotive that was standing still and inquired if he had heard of any accident to a boy soldier during the day. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Seems to me that I did hear some o\u0027 the boys talkin\u0027 about No. 47 or 63 havin\u0027 run over a boy, or something,\" answered the engineer carelessly, without removing his pipe from his mouth. \"I didn\u0027t pay no attention to it. Them things happen every day. Sometimes it\u0027s my engine, sometimes it\u0027s some other man\u0027s. But I hain\u0027t run over nobody for nigh a month now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Confound it,\" said Si savagely; \"you talk about runnin\u0027 over men as if it was part o\u0027 your business.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said the engineer languidly, as he reached up for his bell-rope. \"\u0027Tain\u0027t, so to speak, part o\u0027 our regler business. But the yard\u0027s awfully crowded, old Sherman\u0027s makin\u0027 it do five times the work it was calculated for, trains has got to be run on the dot, and men must keep off the track if they don\u0027t want to git hurt. Stand clear, there, yourself, for I\u0027m goin\u0027 to start.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si returned dejectedly to the place where he had left his squad. The expression of his face told the news before he had spoken a word. It was now getting dark, and he and Shorty decided that it was the best thing to go into bivouac where they were and wait till morning before attempting to penetrate the maze beyond in search of their regiment. They gathered up some wood, built fires, made coffee and ate the remainder of their rations. They were all horribly depressed by little Pete Skidmore\u0027s fate, and Si and Shorty, accustomed as they were to violent deaths, could not free themselves from responsibility however much they tried to reason it out as an unavoidable accident. They could not talk to one another, but each wrapped himself up in his blanket and sat moodily, a little distance from the fires, chewing the cud of bitter fancies. Neither could bear the thought of reporting to their regiment that they had been unable to take care of the smallest boy in their squad. Si\u0027s mind went back to Peter Skidmore\u0027s home, and his mother, whose heart would break over the news. \\n\\n \\n\\n The clanging and whistling of the trains kept up unabated, and Si thought they made the most hateful din that ever assailed his ears. \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently one of the trains stopped opposite them and a voice called from the locomotive: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you men know of a squad of Injianny recruits commanded by Serg\u0027t Klegg?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, here they are,\" said Si, springing up. \"I\u0027m Serg\u0027t Klegg.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Little Pete Found 13 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s him,\" piped out Pete Skidmore\u0027s voice from the engine, with a very noticeable blubber of joy. \"He\u0027s the same durned old-fool that I kept tellin\u0027 all the time he\u0027d lose me if he wasn\u0027t careful, and he went and done it all the same.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, here\u0027s your boy,\" continued the first voice. \"Be mighty glad you\u0027ve got him back and see that you take care o\u0027 him after this. My fireman run down on the cow-ketcher and snatched him up just in the nick o\u0027 time. A second more and he\u0027d bin mince-meat. Men what can\u0027t take better care o\u0027 boys oughtn\u0027t to be allowed to have charge of \u0027em. But the Government gits all sorts o\u0027 damn fools for $13 a month.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si was so delighted at getting Pete back unhurt that he did not have the heart to reply to the engineer\u0027s gibes. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63297.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
