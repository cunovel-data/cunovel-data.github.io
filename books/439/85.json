TEDIOUS CONVALESCENCE","content":"THE DEACON COMMITS A CRIME AGAINST HIS CONSCIENCE. \n \n \"YOU are the father of that boy in the far end of the tent,\" said the Surgeon coming up to the Deacon, who had stepped outside of the tent to get an opportunity to think clearly. \"I\u0027m very glad you have come, for his life hangs by a thread. That thread is his pluck, aided by a superb constitution. Most men would have died on the field from such a wound. Medicine can do but little for him; careful nursing much more; but his own will and your presence and encouragement will do far more than either.\" \n \n \"How about Shorty?\" inquired the Deacon. \n \n \"Shorty\u0027s all right if he don\u0027t get a setback. The danger from the blow on his head is pretty near past, if something don\u0027t come in to make further complications. He has been pulled down pretty badly by the low fever which has been epidemic here since we have settled down in camp, but he seems to be coming out from it all right.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve come down here to do all that\u0027s possible for these two boys. Now, how kin I best do it?\" asked the Deacon. \n \n \"You can do good by helping nurse them. You could do much more good if there was more to do with, but we lack almost everything for the proper care of the wounded and sick. We have 15,000 men in hospital here, and not supplies enough for 3,000. When we will get more depends on just what luck our cavalry has in keeping the rebels off our line of supplies.\" \n \n \"Show me what to do, give me what you kin, and I\u0027ll trust in the Lord and my own efforts for the rest.\" \n \n \"Yes, and you kin count on me to assist,\" chimed in Shorty, who had come up. \"I won\u0027t let you play lone hand long, Deacon, for I\u0027m gittin\u0027 chirpier every day. If I could only fill up good and full once more on hardtack and pork, or some sich luxuries, I\u0027d be as good as new agin.\" \n \n \"You mean you\u0027d be put to bed under three feet of red clay, if you were allowed to eat all you want to,\" said the Surgeon. \"There\u0027s where the wind is tempered to the shorn lamb. If you could eat as much as you want to eat, I should speedily have to bid good-by to you. For the present, Mr. Klegg, do anything that suggests itself to you to make these men comfortable. I need scarcely caution you to be careful about their food, for there is nothing that you can get hold of to over-feed them. But you\u0027d better not let them have anything to eat until I come around again and talk to you more fully. I put them in your charge.\" \n \n The Deacon\u0027s first thought was for Si, and he bestirred himself to do what he thought his wife, who was renowned as a nurse, would do were she there. \n \n He warmed some water, and tenderly as he could command his strong, stubby hands, washed Si\u0027s face, hands and feet, and combed his hair. The overworked hospital attendants had had no time for this much-needed ministration. It was all that they could do to get the wounded under some sort of shelter, to dress their wounds, and prepare food. No well man could be spared from the trenches for hospital service, for the sadly-diminished Army of the Cumberland needed every man who could carry a musket to man the long lines to repel the constantly-threatened assaults. \n \n The removal of the soil and grime of the march and battle had a remarkably vivifying effect upon Si. New life seemed to pulse through his veins and brightness return to his eyes. \n \n \"Makes me feel like a new man, Pap,\" he said faintly. \"Feels better than anything I ever knowed. Do the same to Shorty, Pap.\" \n \n \"Come here, Shorty, you dirty little rascal,\" said the Deacon, assuming a severely maternal tone, at which Si laughed feebly but cheerily, \"and let me wash your face and comb your hair.\" \n \n Shorty demurred a little at being treated like a boy, and protested that he could wash himself, if the Deacon would get him some warm water; but he saw that the conceit amused Si, and submitted to having the Deacon give him a scrubbing with a soapy rag, giving a yell from time to time, in imitation of an urchin undergoing an unwilling ablution. Si turned his head so as to witness the operation, and grinned throughout it. \n \n \"I think you\u0027d both feel still better if you could have your hair cut,\" said the Deacon, as he finished and looked from one to the other. \"Your hair\u0027s too long for sick people, and it makes you look sicker\u0027n you really are. But I hain\u0027t got no shears.\" \n \n \"I know I\u0027d feel better if I was sheared,\" said Shorty. \"Hain\u0027t neither of us had our hair cut since we started on the Tullyhomy campaign, and I think I look like the Wild Man from Borneo. I think I know a feller that has a pair o\u0027 shears that I kin borry.\" \n \n The shears were found and borrowed. Then ensued a discussion as to the style of the cut. The boys wanted their hair taken off close to their heads, \u0027but the Deacon demurred to this for fear they would catch cold. \n \n \"No, Si,\" he said; \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to cut your hair jest like your mother used to. She used to tie one of her garters from your forehead down across your ears, and cut off all the hair that stuck out. I hain\u0027t any garter, but I guess I kin find a string that\u0027ll do jest as well.\" \n \n \"There,\" said the Deacon, as he finished shearing off the superabundant hair, and surveyed the work. \"That ain\u0027t as purty a job as if your mother\u0027d done it, but you\u0027ll feel lighter and cleaner, and be healthier. If hair was only worth as much as wool is now, I\u0027d have enough to pay me for the job. But I must clean it up keerfully and burn it, that the birds mayn\u0027t git hold of it and give you the headache.\" \n \n The Deacon had his little superstitions, like a great many other hard-headed, sensible men. \n \n \"Well, Mr. Klegg,\" said the Surgeon, when he made his next round, \"I must congratulate you on your patients. Both show a remarkable improvement. You ought to apply for a diploma, and go into the practice of medicine. You have done more for them in the two or three hours than I have been able to do in as many weeks. If you could only keep up this pace awhile I would be able to return them to duty very soon. I have an idea. Do you see that corn-crib over there?\" \n \n \"The one built of poles? Yes.\" \n \n \"Well, I have some things stored there, and I have been able to hold it so far against the soldiers, who are snatching every stick of wood they can find, for their cabins, or for the breastworks, or firewood. I don\u0027t know how long I\u0027ll be able to keep it, unless I have personal possession. I believe you can make it into a comfortable place for these two men. That will help them, you can be by yourselves, you can take care of my things, and it will relieve the crowd in the tent.\" \n \n \"Splendid idea,\" warmly assented the Deacon. \"I\u0027ll chink and daub it, and make it entirely comfortable, and fix up bunks in it for the boys. I know they\u0027ll be delighted at the change. I wonder where Shorty is?\" \n \n The Deacon had just remembered that he had not seen that individual for some little time, and looked around for him with some concern. It was well that he did. Shorty had come across the haversack that the Deacon had brought, and it awakened all his old predatory instincts, sharpened, if anything, by his feebleness. Without saying a word to any body, he had employed the time while the Surgeon and Deacon were in conversation in preparing one of his customary gorges after a long, hard march. \n \n He had broken up the crackers into a tin-cup of water which sat by his side, while he was frying out pieces of fat pork in a half-canteen. \n \n \"My goodness, man!\" shouted the Deacon, spring ing toward him. \"Are you crazy? If you eat that mess you\u0027ll be dead before morning.\" \n \n He sprang toward him, snatched the half-canteen from his hand, and threw its contents on the ground. \n \n \"That stuff\u0027s not fit to put into an ostrich\u0027s stomach,\" he said. \"Mr. Klegg, you will have to watch this man very carefully.\" \n \n \"Can\u0027t I have none of it to eat?\" said Shorty, dejectedly, with tears of weakness and longing in his eyes. \n \n \"Not a mouthful of that stuff,\" said the Surgeon; \"but you may eat some of those crackers you have soaked there. Mr. Klegg, let him eat about half of those crackers no more.\" \n \n Shorty looked as if the whole world had lost its charms. \"Hardtack without grease\u0027s no more taste than chips,\" he murmured. \n \n \"Never mind, Shorty,\" said the Deacon, pityingly; \"I\u0027ll manage to find you something that\u0027ll be better for you than that stuff.\" \n \n The Surgeon had the boys carried over to the corncrib, and the Deacon went to work to make it as snug as possible. All the old training of his pioneer days when literally with his own hands, and with the rudest materials, he had built a comfortable cabin in the wilderness of the Wabash bottoms for his young wife came back to him. He could not see a brick, a piece of board, a stick, or a bit of iron anywhere without the thought that it might be made useful, and carrying it off. As there were about 40,000 other men around the little village of Chattanooga with similar inclinations, the Deacon had need of all his shrewdness in securing coveted materials, but it was rare that anybody got ahead of him. He rearranged and patched the clapboards on the roof until it was perfectly rain-tight, chinked up the spaces between the poles with stones, corncobs and pieces of wood, and plastered over the outside with clay, until the walls were draft proof. He hung up an old blanket for a door, and hired a teamster to bring in a load of silky-fine beech leaves which, when freshly fallen, make a bed that cannot be surpassed. These, by spreading blankets over them, made very comfort able couches for Si, Shorty and himself. \n \n Then the great problem became one of proper food for the boys. Daily the rations were growing shorter in Chattanooga, and if they had been plentiful they were not suited to the delicate stomachs of those seriously ill. Si was slowly improving, but the Deacon felt that the thing necessary to carry him over the breakers and land him safely on the shores of recovery was nourishing food that he could relish. \n \n He had anxiously sought the entire length of the camp for something of that kind. He had visited all the sutlers, and canvassed the scanty stocks in the few stores in Chattanooga. He had bought the sole remaining can of tomatoes at a price which would have almost bought the field in which the tomatoes were raised, and he had turned over the remnant lots of herring, cheese, etc., he found at the sutler\u0027s, with despair at imagining any sort of way in which they could be worked up to become appetizing and assimilative to Si\u0027s stomach. \n \n \"What you and Si needs,\" he would say to Shorty, \"is chicken and fresh \u0027taters. If you could have a good mess of chicken and \u0027taters every day you\u0027d come up like Spring shoats. I declare I\u0027d give that crick bottom medder o\u0027 mine, which hasn\u0027t it\u0027s beat on the Wabash, to have mother\u0027s coopful o\u0027 chickens here this minute.\" \n \n But a chicken was no more to be had in Chattanooga than a Delmonico banquet. The table of the Major-General commanding the Army of the Cumberland might have a little more hardtack and pork on it than appeared in the tents of the privates, and be cooked a little better, but it had nothing but hardtack and pork. \n \n The Deacon made excursions into the country, and even ran great risks from the rebel pickets and bushwhackers, in search of chickens. But the country had been stripped, by one side or the other, of everything eatable, and the people that remained in their cheerless homes were dependent upon what they could get from the United States Commissary. \n \n One day he found the Herd-Boss in camp, and poured forth his troubles to him. The Herd-Boss sympathized deeply with him, and cudgeled his brains for a way to help. \n \n \"I\u0027ll tell you what you might do,\" he said at length, \"if you care to take the risk. We\u0027re goin\u0027 back with some teams to Bridgeport to-morrow mornin\u0027. You might git in one of the wagons and ride back 10 or 15 miles to a little valley that I remember that\u0027s there, and which I think looks like it hain\u0027t bin foraged. I was thinkin\u0027 as we come through the other day that I might git something goo\u0027d to eat up there, and I\u0027d try it some day. No body seems to \u0027ve noticed it yit. But it may be chock full o\u0027 rebels, for all I know, and a feller git jumped the moment he sets foot in it.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll take my chances,\" said the Deacon. \"I\u0027ll go along with you to-morrer mornin\u0027.\" \n \n The Deacon found that a ride in a wagon was not such an unqualified favor as he might have thought. The poor, half-fed, overworked mules went so slowly that the Deacon could make better time walking, and he was too merciful to allow them to pull him up hill. \n \n The result was that, with helping pry the stalled wagons out and work in making the roads more passable, the Deacon expended more labor than if he had started out to walk in the first place. \n \n It was late in the afternoon when the Herd-Boss said: \n \n \"There, you take that path to the right, and in a little ways you\u0027ll come out by a purty good house. I hain\u0027t seen any Johnnies around in this neighborhood since I\u0027ve bin travelin\u0027 this route, but you\u0027d better keep your eye peeled, all the same. If you see any, skip back to the road here, and wait awhile. Somebody \u0027ll be passin\u0027 before long.\" \n \n Thanking him, the Deacon set out for the house, hoping to be able to reach it, get some fowls, and be back to Chattanooga before morning. If he got the chickens, he felt sanguine that he could save Si\u0027s life. \n \n He soon came in sight of the house, the only one, apparently, for miles, and scanned it carefully. There were no men to be seen, though the house appeared to be inhabited. He took another look at the heavy revolver which he had borrowed from the Surgeon, and carried ready for use in the pocket of Si\u0027s overcoat, and began a strategic advance, keep ing well out of sight under the cover of the sumachs lining the fences. \n \n Still he saw no one, and finally he became so bold as to leave his covert and walk straight to the front door. A dozen dogs charged at him with a wild hullabaloo, but he had anticipated this, and picked up a stout hickory switch in the road, which he wielded with his left hand with so much effect that they ran howling back under the house. He kept his right hand firmly grasping his revolver. \n \n An old man and his wife appeared at the door; both of them shoved back their spectacles until they rested on the tops of their heads, and scanned him searchingly. The old woman had a law-book in her hand, and the old man a quill pen. She had evidently been reading to him, and he copying. \n \n The old man called out to him imperiously: \n \n \"Heah, stranger, who air yo\u0027? An\u0027 what d\u0027yo\u0027 want?\" \n \n The tone was so harsh and repellant that the Deacon thought that he would disarm hostility by announcing himself a plain citizen, like themselves. So he replied: \n \n \"I\u0027m a farmer, and a citizen from Injianny, and I want to buy some chickens for my son, who\u0027s sick in the hospital at Chattanoogy.\" \n \n \"Injianny!\" sneered the old man. \"Meanest people in the world live in Injianny. Settled by scalawags that we\u0027uns run outen Tennessee bekase they\u0027uns wuz too onery to live heah.\" \n \n \"Citizen!\" echoed the woman. \"They\u0027uns heap sight wuss\u0027n the soldjers. Teamsters, gamblers, camp-followers, thieves, that\u0027ll steal the coppers off en a dead man\u0027s eyes. I had a sister that married a man that beat her, and then run off to Injianny, leavin\u0027 her with six children to support. All the mean men go to Injianny. Cl\u0027ar out. We don\u0027t want nobody \u0027round heah, and specially no Injiannians. They\u0027uns is a pizun lot.\" \n \n \"Yes, cl\u0027ar out immejitly,\" commanded the old man. \"I\u0027m a Jestice of the Peace, and ef you don\u0027t go to wunst I\u0027ll find a way to make yo\u0027. We\u0027ve a law agin able-bodied vagrants. Cl\u0027ar out, now.\" \n \n \"Come, have a little sense,\" said the Deacon, not a little roiled at the abuse of his State. \"I\u0027m just as respectable a man as you dare be. I never stole anything. I\u0027ve bin all my life a regler member o\u0027 the Baptist Church strict, close-communion, total-immersion Baptists. All I want o\u0027 you is to buy some o\u0027 them chickens there, and I\u0027ll give you a fair price for \u0027em. No use o\u0027 your flaring up over a little matter o\u0027 bizniss.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t believe a word of hit,\" said the woman, who yet showed that she was touched by the allusion to the Baptist Church, as the Deacon had calculated, for most of the people of that section professed to be of that denomination. \"What\u0027ll yo\u0027 gi\u0027 me for them chickens?\" \n \n The bargaining instinct arose in the Deacon\u0027s mind, but he repressed it. He had no time to waste. He would make an offer that at home would be considered wildly extravagant, close the business at once and get back to Chattanooga. He said: \"I\u0027ll give you a dollar apiece for five.\" \n \n \u0027he Took Another Look at his Heavy Revolver.\u0027 254 \n \n \"Humph,\" said the woman contemptuously. \"I don\u0027t sell them for no dollar apiece. They\u0027uns \u0027s all we got to live on now. If I sell \u0027em I must git somethin\u0027 that\u0027ll go jest as fur. You kin have \u0027em at $5 apiece.\" \n \n \"Betsy,\" remonstrated the old man, \"I\u0027m afeard this \u0027s wrong, and as a Magistrate I shouldn\u0027t allow hit. Hit\u0027s traffickin\u0027 with the inemy.\" \n \n \"No, hit hain\u0027t,\" she asserted. \"He\u0027s not a soljer. He\u0027s a citizen, and don\u0027t belong to the army. Besides, he\u0027s a Baptist, and hit hain\u0027t so bad as ef he wuz a Presbyterian, or a shoutin\u0027 Methodist. Most of all, I\u0027m nearly dead for some coffee, and I know whar I kin git a pound o\u0027 rayle coffee for $10.\" \n \n The Deacon had been pondering. To his thrifty mind it seemed like a waste to give a crisp, new $5 bill for such an insignificant thing as a chicken. Like Indiana farmers of his period, he regarded such things as chickens, eggs, butter, etc., as \"too trifling for full-grown men to bother about. They were wholly women-folks\u0027 truck.\" He fingered the bills in his bosom, and thought how many bushels of wheat and pounds of pork they represented. Then he thought of Si in the hospital, and how a little chicken broth would build him up. Out came five new $5 bills. \n \n \"Here\u0027s your money,\" he said, thumbing over the bills clumsily and regretfully. \n \n The old woman lowered her spectacles from the top of her head, and scrutinized them. \n \n \"What\u0027s them?\" she asked suspiciously. \n \n \"Why, them\u0027s greenbacks Government money the very best kind,\" explained the Deacon. \"You can\u0027t have no better\u0027n that.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t tech hit! Don\u0027t have nothin\u0027 to do with it!\" shouted the old man. \"Hit\u0027s high treason to take Federal money. Law\u0027s awful severe about that. Not less\u0027n one year, nor more\u0027n 20 in the penitentiary, for a citizen, and death for a soljer, to be ketched dealin\u0027 in the inemy\u0027s money. I kin turn yo\u0027 right to the law. Ole man, take yo\u0027 money and cl\u0027ar off the place immejitly. Go out and gather up yo\u0027 chickens, Betsy, and fasten \u0027em in the coop. Go away, sah, \u0027or I shell blow the horn for help.\" \n \n \"I wuz talkin\u0027 \u0027bout Confederit money,\" said the woman, half apologetically. \"I wouldn\u0027t tech that \u0027ere stuff with a soap-stick. Yo\u0027d better git away as quick as yo\u0027 kin ef yo\u0027 know what\u0027s good for yo\u0027.\" \n \n She went into the yard to gather up her flock, and the Deacon walked back into the road. When out of sight he sat down on a rock to meditate. There was not another house in sight anywhere, and it was rapidly growing dark. If he went to an other house he would probably have the same experience. He had set his heart on having those chickens, and he was a pretty stubborn man. Somehow, in spite of himself, he parted the bushes and looked through to see where the woman was housing her fowls, and noted that it was going to be very dark. Then he blushed vividly, all to himself, over the thoughts which arose. \n \n \"To think of me, a Deacon in the Baptist Church, akchelly meditatin\u0027 about goin\u0027 to another man\u0027s coop at night and stealin\u0027 his chickens? Could Maria ever be made to believe such a thing? I can\u0027t be lieve it myself.\" \n \n Then he made himself think of all the other ways in which he might get chickens. They all seemed impossible. He turned again to those in the coop. \n \n \"Nothin\u0027 but measly dunhills, after all dear at a fip-and-a-bit, and yet I offered her a dollar apiece for \u0027em. If she\u0027d bin a real Christian woman she\u0027d bin glad to \u0027ve given me the chickens for as sick as man as Si is. Gracious, mother\u0027d give every chicken on the place, if it\u0027d help a sick person, and be glad o\u0027 the chance. They\u0027re both tough old rebels, anyhow, and their property oughtter be confiscated.\" \n \n He stopped and considered the morals of the affair a little further, and somehow the idea of taking the fowls by stealth did not seem so abhorrent as at first. Then, everything was overslaughed by the thought of going into camp with the precious birds, of cleaning one and carefully stewing it, making a delicate, fragrant broth, the very smell of which would revive Si, and every spoonful bring nourishment and strength. \n \n \"Mebbe the army\u0027s demoralizin\u0027 me,\" he said to himself; \"but I believe it\u0027s a work o\u0027 necessity and mercy, that don\u0027t stand on nice considerations. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to have five o\u0027 them chickens, or know the reason why.\" \n \n As has been before remarked, when Deacon Klegg made up his mind something had to happen. It was now quite dark. He took one of the $5 bills out of his breast pocket and put it in a pocket where it would be handy. He looked over at the house, and saw the old man and woman sitting by the fire smoking. He picked up the hickory withe to keep off the dogs, and made a circuit to reach the chicken-coop from the rear of the house. The dogs were quarreling and snarling over their supper, and paid no attention to him, until he had reached the coop, when they came at him full tilt. \n \n The Deacon dealt the foremost ones such vicious blows that the beasts fell as if they had been cut in two, and ran howling under the house. With a quickness and skill that would have done credit to any veteran in the army, he snatched five chickens from their roosts, wrung their necks, and gathered them in his left hand. Alarmed by the noise of the barking and yelping, the old couple flung open the door and rushed out on the porch with shouts. The open door threw a long lane of bright light directly on the Deacon. \n \n \"Blow the horn, granddad blow the horn,\" screamed the woman. Her husband snatched the tin horn down from the wall, and put all his anger into a ringing blast. It was immediately answered by a shot from a distant hill. Still holding his game in his left hand, the Deacon pulled the $5 bill out of his pocket with his right, walked up to the porch, laid it at the woman\u0027s feet and put a stone on it. \n \n \"There\u0027s full pay for your dumbed old dunghills, you cantankerous rebel,\" said he, as he disappeared into the darkness. \"Go into the house and pray that the Lord may soften your heart, which is harder than Pharaoh\u0027s, until you have some Christian grace.\" \n \n When he reached the road he could hear the sound of hoofs galloping toward the house. He smiled grimly, but kept under the shadow of the trees until he reached the main road leading to Chattanooga, where he was lucky enough to find a train making its slow progress toward the town, and kept with it until he was within our lines. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63272.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
