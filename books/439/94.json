{"id":45129,"no":94,"title":"CHAPTER VII. WEEKS OF CONVALESCENCE","content":"PLENTY OF NURSING FROM LOVING, TENDER HANDS. WHAT days those were that followed the arrival of the boys home. In Shorty\u0027s hard, rough life he had never so much as dreamed of such immaculate housekeeping as Mrs. Klegg\u0027s. He had hardly been in speaking distance of such women as Si\u0027s mother and sisters. To see these bright, blithe, sweet-speeched women moving about the well-ordered house in busy performance of their duties was a boundless revelation to him. It opened up a world of which he had as little conception as of a fairy realm. For the first time he began to understand things that Si had told him of his home, yet it meant a hundredfold more to him than to Si, for Si had been brought up in that home. Shorty began to regard the Deacon and Si as superior beings, and to stand in such awe of Mrs. Klegg and the girls that he became as tongue-tied as a bashful school-boy in their presence. It amazed him to hear Si, when the girls would teaze him, speak to them as sharply as brothers sometimes will, and just as if they were ordinary mortals. \"Si, you orter to be more careful in talkin\u0027 to your sisters,\" he remonstrated when they were alone. \"You\u0027ve bin among rough men so long that you don\u0027t know how to talk to real ladies.\" \"O, come off,\" said Si, petulantly. \"What\u0027s a-eatin you. You don\u0027t know them girls as well as I do. Particularly Maria. She\u0027ll run right over you if you let her. She\u0027s one o\u0027 the best girls that ever breathed, but you\u0027ve got to keep a tight rein on her. The feller that marries her\u0027s got to keep the whip-hand or she\u0027ll make him wish that he\u0027d never bin born.\" Shorty\u0027s heart bounded at the thought of any man having the unspeakable happiness of marrying that peerless creature, and then having the meanness not to let her do precisely as she wanted to. Both the boys had been long enough in the field to make that plain farm home seem a luxurious palace of rest. The beds were wonders of softness and warmth, from which no unwelcome reveille or cross-grained Orderly-Sergeant aroused them with profane threats of extra duty. Instead, after peeping cautiously through the door to see that they were awake, the girls would come in with merry greeting, bowls of warm water, and soft, white towels fragrant of the lawn. Maria would devote herself to helping Shorty get ready for breakfast, and Amanda to Si. Shorty trembled like a captured rabbit when Maria first began her ministrations. All his blood rushed to his face, and he tried to mumble something about being able to take care of himself, which that straightforward young woman paid not the slightest attention to. After his first fright was over there was a thrilling delight about the operation which electrified him. When the boys were properly washed and combed, Mrs. Klegg, her kind, motherly face beaming with consciousness of good and acceptable service, would enter with a large tray, laden with fragrant coffee, delicious cream, golden butter, her own peerless bread and bits of daintily-broiled chicken. \"Si,\" said Shorty, one morning after he had finished the best breakfast he had ever known, the girls had gone away with the things, and he was leaning back thinking it all over in measureless content, \"if the preachers\u0027d preach that a feller\u0027d go to such a place as this when he died if he was real good, how good we\u0027d all be, and we\u0027d be rather anxious to die. How in the world are we ever goin\u0027 to git up spunk enough to leave this and go back to the field?\" \"You\u0027ll git tired o\u0027 this soon enough,\" said Si. \"It\u0027s awful nice for a change, but I don\u0027t want it to last long. I want to be able to git up and git out. I hate awfully to have women-folks putterin\u0027 around me.\" The boys could not help rapidly recovering under such favorable conditions, and soon they were able to sit up most of the day. In the evening, ensconced in the big Shaker rocking chairs, sitting on pillows, and carefully swathed in blankets, they would sit on either side of the bright fire, with the family and neighbors forming the semi-circle between, and talk over the war interminably. The neighbors all had sons and brothers in the army, either in the 200th Ind. or elsewhere, and were hungry for every detail of army news. They plied Si and Shorty with questions until the boys\u0027 heads ached. Then the Deacon would help out with his observations of camp-life. \"I\u0027m not goin\u0027 to believe,\" said one good old brother, who was an exhorter in the Methodist Church, \"that the army is sich a pitfall, sich a snare to the feet o\u0027 the unwary as many try to make out. There\u0027s no need of any man or boy who goes to serve his country and his God, fallin\u0027 from grace and servin\u0027 the devil. Don\u0027t you think so, too. Deacon? There\u0027s no reason why he shouldn\u0027t be jest as good a man there as he is at home. Don\u0027t you think so, too. Deacon Klegg?\" \"Um—um-um,\" hemmed the Deacon, getting red in the face, and avoiding answering the question by a vigorous stirring of the fire, while Si slily winked at Shorty. \"I impressed that on son Jed\u0027s mind when he enlisted,\" continued the brother. \"Jed was always a good, straight up-and-down boy; never gave me or his mother a minute\u0027s uneasiness. I told him to have no more to do with cards than with smallpox; to avoid liquor as he would the bite of a rattlesnake; to take nothin\u0027 from other people that he didn\u0027t pay full value for; that swearin\u0027 was a pollution to the lips and the heart. I know that Jed hearkened to all that I said, and that it sank into his heart, and that he\u0027ll come back, if it\u0027s God\u0027s will that he shall come back, as good a boy as when he went away.\" Si and Shorty did not trust themselves to look at one another before the trusting father\u0027s eyes, for Jedediah Bennett, who was one of the best soldiers in Co. Q, had developed a skill at poker that put all the other boys on their mettle; and as for foraging—well, neither Si nor Shorty ever looked for anything in a part where Jed Bennett had been. \"Deacon,\" persisted Mr. Bennett, \"you saw a great deal o\u0027 the army. You didn\u0027t see the wickedness down there that these Copperheads \u0027s chargin\u0027, did you? You only found men wicked that\u0027d be wicked any place, and really good men jest as good there as at home?\" \"It\u0027s jest as you say, Mr. Bennett,\" answered the Deacon, coughing to gain time for a diplomatic answer, and turning so that the boys could not see his face. \"A wicked man\u0027s wicked anywhere, and he finds more chance for his wickedness in the army. A good man ought to be good wherever he\u0027s placed, but there are positions which are more tryin\u0027 than others. By the way, Maria, bring us some apples and hickory nuts. Bring in a basketful o\u0027 them Rome Beauties for Mr. Bennett to take home with him. You recollect them trees that I budded with Rome Beauty scions that I got up the river, don\u0027t you, Bennett? Well, they bore this year, and I\u0027ve bin calculatin\u0027 to send over some for you and Mrs. Bennett. I tell you, they\u0027re beauties indeed. Big as your fist, red as a hollyhock, fragrant as a rose, and firm and juicy. I have sent for scions enough to bud half my orchard. I won\u0027t raise nothin\u0027 hereafter but Rome Beauties and Russets.\" The apples and nuts were brought in, together with some of Mrs. Klegg\u0027s famous crullers and a pitcher of sweet cider, and for awhile all were engaged in discussing the delicious apples. To paraphrase Dr. Johnson, God undoubtedly could make a better fruit than a Rome Beauty apple from a young tree, growing in the right kind of soil, but undoubtedly He never did. The very smell of the apple is a mild intoxication, and its firm, juicy flesh has a delicacy of taste that the choicest vintages of the Rhine cannot surpass. But Mr. Bennett was persistent on the subject of morality in the army. He soon refused the offer of another apple, laid his knife back on the plate, put the plate on the table, wiped his mouth and hands, and said: \"Deacon, these brothers and sisters who have come here with me to-night are, like myself, deeply interested in the moral condition of the army, where we all have sons or kinsmen. Now, can\u0027t you sit right there and tell us of your observations and experiences, as a Christian man and father, from day to day, of every day that you were down there? Tell us everything, just as it happened each day, that we may be able to judge for ourselves.\" Si trembled a httle, for fear that they had his father cornered. But the Deacon was equal to the emergency. \"It\u0027s a\u0027most too late, now, Mr. Bennett,\" he said, looking at the clock, \"for it\u0027s a long story. You know I was down there quite a spell. We can\u0027t keep these boys out o\u0027 bed late now, and by the time we have family worship it\u0027ll be high time for them to be tucked in. Won\u0027t you read us a chapter o\u0027 the Bible and lead us in prayer, Brother Bennett?\" While Shorty was rapidly gaining health and strength, his mind was ill at ease. He had more time than ever to think of Jerusha Briggs, of Bad Ax, Wis., and his surroundings accentuated those thoughts. He began by wondering what sort of a girl she really was, compared to Si\u0027s sisters, and whether she was used to such a home as this? Was she as handsome, as fine, as high-spirited as Maria? Then his loyal soul reproached him. If she would have him he would marry her, no matter who she she was. Why should he begin now making comparisons with other girls? Then, she might be far finer than Maria. How would he himself compare with her, when he dared not even raise his eyes to Maria? He had not written her since the Tullahoma campaign. That seemed an age away, so many things had happened in the meanwhile. He blamed himself for his neglect, and resolved to write at once, to tell her where he was, what had happened to him, and that he was going to try to visit her before returning to the field. But difficult as writing had always been, it was incomparably more so now. He found that where he thought of Jerusha once, he was thinking of Maria a hundred times. Not that he would admit to himself there was any likeness in his thoughts about the two girls. He did not recognize that there was anything sentimental in those about Maria. She was simply some infinitely bright, superior sort of a being, whose voice was sweeter than a bird\u0027s, and whose presence seemed to brighten the room. He found himself uncomfortable when she was out of sight. The company of Si or his father was not as all-sufficient and interesting as it used to be. When Maria went out of the room they became strangely dull and almost tiresome, unless they talked of her. Worse yet. As he grew stronger and better able to take care of himself Maria dropped the familiarity of the nurse, and began putting him on the footing of a young gentleman and a guest of the house. She came no more into the room with the basin of warm water, and got him ready for his breakfast. She toned down carefully with every improvement in his strength. First, she merely brought him the basin and towel, and then as he grew able to go about she would rap on his door and tell him to come out and get ready for breakfast. Shorty began to feel that he was losing much by getting well, and that his convalescence had been entirely too rapid. Then he would go off and try to compose his thoughts for a letter to Jerusha Briggs, but before he knew it he would find himself in the kitchen watching, with dumb admiration, Maria knead bread, with her sleeves rolled to her shoulders, and her white, plump arms and bright face streaked with flour. There would be little conversation, for Maria would sing with a lark\u0027s voice, as she worked, some of the sweet old hymns, chording with Amanda, busy in another part of the house. Shorty did not want to talk. It was enough for him to feast his eyes and ears. They were sitting down to supper one evening when little Sammy Woggles came in from the station. \"There\u0027s your Cincinnati Gazette,\" he said, handing the paper to the Deacon, \"and there\u0027s a letter for Si.\" \"Open it and read it, Maria,\" said Si, to whom reading of letters meant labor, and he was yet too weak for work. \"It\u0027s postmarked Chattanooga, Tenn.,\" said she, scanning the envelope carefully, \"and addressed to Sergeant Josiah Klegg, 200th Indiana Volunteer Infantry, Bean Blossom Creek, Ind.\" \"Sergeant!\" ejaculated Si, Shorty and the Deacon, in the same breath. \"Are you sure it\u0027s Sergeant?\" \"Yes, it\u0027s Sergeant,\" said Maria, spelling the title out. \"Who in the world do you s\u0027pose it\u0027s from, Si?\" \"It don\u0027t seem to occur to you that you could find out by openin\u0027 it,\" said the Deacon, sarcastically. \"Open it and see who it\u0027s from,\" said Si. \"The man writes a mighty nice hand,\" said Maria, scanning the superscription. \"Just like that man that taught writing-school here last Winter. It can\u0027t be from him, can it? Didn\u0027t s\u0027pose there was anybody in your company that could write as well as that. Look, Si, and see if you can tell whose handwritin\u0027 it is.\" \"O, open it, Maria,\" groaned Si, \"and you\u0027ll likely find his name writ somewhere inside.\" \"Don\u0027t be so impatient. Si,\" said Maria, feeling around for a hair-pin with which to rip open the envelope. \"You\u0027re gittin\u0027 crosser\u0027n two sticks since you\u0027re gittin\u0027 well.\" \"He certainly does write a nice hand,\" said Maria, scanning the inclosure deliberately. \"Just see how he makes his d\u0027s and s\u0027s. All his up-strokes are light, and all his down ones are heavy, just as the writing-master used to teach. And his curves are just lovely. And what a funny name he has signed. J. T. No; I. T. No; that\u0027s a J, because it comes down below the line. M-c-G-i-l-l—I can\u0027t make out the rest.\" \"McGillicuddy; ain\u0027t that it?\" said Si eagerly. \"It\u0027s from Capt. McGillicuddy. Read it, Maria.\" \"McGillicuddy. Well, of all the names!\" said that deliberate young woman. \"Do you really mean to say that any man has really such a name as that?\" \"\u0027Mandy, take that letter away from her and read it,\" commanded Si. \"Well, I\u0027m goin\u0027 to read your old letter for you, if you\u0027ll just gi\u0027 me time,\" remonstrated Maria. \"What are you in such a hurry for, old cross-patch? Le\u0027 me see: \"Headquarters, Co. Q, 200th Indiana Volunteer Infantry. \"Chattanooga, Tenn., Nov. 20, 1863. \"Sergeant Josiah Klegg. \"Dear Klegg: I have not heard from you since you left, but I am going to hope that you are getting well right along. All the boys think of you and Shorty, and send their love and their hopes that you will soon be back with us. We all miss you very much. \"I have some good news for you and Shorty. On my recommendation the Colonel has issued a special order promoting you Sergeant and Shorty Corporal, for gallant and meritorious services at the battle of Chickamauga, in which you captured a rebel flag. The order was read on parade this evening. So it is Sergeant Klegg and Corporal Elliott hereafter, and they will be obeyed and respected accordingly. You will take poor Pettibone\u0027s place, and Elliott will take Harney\u0027s. \"I do not know where Elliott is, but expect that he is with you. If so, give him the news, and also the inclosed letter, which came to me. If not, and you know where he is, write him. \"Write me as soon as you can. We are all getting along very well, especially since Grant came up and opened our cracker line. My little hurt is healing nicely, so that I can go about with a cane. We are all getting ready to jump old Bragg on Mission Ridge, and I am going to do my best to go along at the head of Co. Q, though I have been Acting Major and Lieutenant-Colonel since I got up. \"Regards to your father, and believe me, sincerely your friend, \"J. T. MCGILLICUDDY, \"Captain, Co. Q, 200th Ind. Inf. Vols.\" Maria passed the letter over to Si to read again, and without more ado opened the inclosure. As she did so, a glance of recognition of the handwriting flashed upon Shorty, and he started to take the letter from her, but felt ashamed to do so. \"Why, this is from a woman,\" said Maria, \"and she writes an awful bad, scratchy hand.\" Being a woman\u0027s letter she was bound to read it without loss of time, and she did so: \"Bad Ax, Wis., Nov. 10. \"Capt. McGillicuddy. \"Dear Sir: I believe you command the company, as they call it, in which there was a gentleman named Mr. Elliott. The papers reports that he was kild at thfe battle of Chickamaugy. I had some correspondence with him, and I sent him my picture. Would you kindly write me the particklers of his death, and also what was done with sich letters and other things that he had? I would very much like to have you return me my letters and picture if you have them. Send them by express to Miss Jerusha Briggs, at this plais, and I will pay the charges. I will explain to you why I want them sent to a difrunt naim than that which I sign. Upon learnin\u0027 of Mr. Elliott\u0027s deth I excepted the addresses of Mr. Adams, whose wife passed away last summer. You may think I was in a hurry, but widowers always mene bizniss when they go a-courtin\u0027, as you will know if ever you was a widower, and he had two little girls who needed a mother\u0027s care. My husband is inclined to be jelous, as widowers usually are, and I don\u0027t want him to ever know nothin\u0027 about my letters to Mr. Elliott, and him havin\u0027 my picture. I am goin\u0027 to ask you to help me, as a gentleman and a Christian, and to keep this confidential. \"Very respectfully, \"Mrs. Benj. F. Adams.\" They all listened eagerly to the reading of the letter, and when it was finished looked for Shorty. But he had gone outside, where there was more air. Shorty Went Outside Where There Was More Air.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63281.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
