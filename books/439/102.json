{"id":45137,"no":102,"title":"CHAPTER XV. OFF FOR THE FRONT","content":"SI AND SHORTY TAKE CHARGE OF A SQUAD OF RECRUITS. \\n\\n \\n\\n WHEN the boys came to breakfast the next morning, they found Maria with the hollyhock effulgence of garb of the day before changed to the usual prim simplicity of her housedress. This meant admiration striking Shorty still dumber. He was in that state of mind when every change in the young woman\u0027s appearance seemed a marvelous transformation and made her more captivating than before. He had thought her queenly dazzling in her highly-colored \"go-to-meeting\" plumage of the day before. She was now simply overpowering in her plain, close-fitting calico, that outlined her superb bust and curves, with her hair combed smoothly back from her bright, animated face. Shorty devoured her with his eyes—that is, when she was not looking in his direction. He would rather watch her than eat his breakfast, but when her glance turned toward him he would drop his eyes to his plate. This became plain to everybody, even Maria, but did not prevent her beginning to tease. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter with you? Where\u0027s your appetite?\" asked she. \"You\u0027re clean off your feed. You must be in love. Nothin\u0027 else\u0027d make a man go back on these slapjacks that Cousin Marthy made with her own hands, and she kin beat the County on slapjacks. Mebbe you\u0027re thinkin\u0027 o\u0027 your Bad Ax girl and her widower. Perk up. He may fall offen a saw-log and git drowned, and you git her yit. Never kin tell. Life\u0027s mighty uncertain, especially around saw-mills. When I marry a man he\u0027s got to give bonds not to have anything to do, in no way or shape, with saw-mills. I don\u0027t want to be a widder, or take care o\u0027 half a man for the rest o\u0027 my days. You\u0027ve got a chance to git your girl yit. Mebbe she\u0027ll git tired o\u0027 him after he\u0027s bin run through the mill two or three times, and there\u0027s more o\u0027 him in the graveyard than there is walkin\u0027 to church with her. Cheer up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty tried to disprove the charge as to the subject of his thoughts by falling to furiously and with such precipitation that he spilt his coffee, upset the molasses-jug, and then collapsed in dismay at his clumsiness. \\n\\n \\n\\n Maria did not go free herself. The other girls had not been blind to Shorty\u0027s condition of mind, and rather suspected that Maria was not wholly indifferent to him. When she came into the kitchen for another supply. Cousin Susie, younger sister of Martha, remarked: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maria, I\u0027ve a notion to take your advice, and set my cap for Corpril Shorty. Do you know, I think he\u0027s very good lookin\u0027. He\u0027s a little rough and clumsy, but a girl could take that out o\u0027 him. I believe I\u0027ll begin right away. You stay in here and bake and I\u0027ll wait on the table.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be a little goose, Susie,\" said Maria severely. \"You\u0027re too young yit to think about beaux. You hain\u0027t got used to long dresses yit. You go practice on boys in roundabouts awhile. This is a full-grown man and a soldier. He hain\u0027t got no time to waste on schoolgirls.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ha, how you talk, Miss Jealousy,\" responded Susie. \"How scared you are lest I cut you out. I\u0027ve a great mind to do it, just to show you I kin. I\u0027d like awfully to have a sweetheart down at the front, just to crow over the rest o\u0027 the girls. Here, you take the turner and let me carry that plate in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll do nothin\u0027 o\u0027 the kind,\" said Maria, decisively. \"You look out for your cakes there. They\u0027re burnin\u0027 while you\u0027re gossipin\u0027. That\u0027s my brother and his friend, and I hain\u0027t got but a short time to be with \u0027em. I may never see \u0027em agin, and I want to do all I kin for \u0027em while they\u0027re with me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Too bad about your brother,\" laughed Susie. \"How lovin\u0027 and attentive all at once. I remember how you used to wig him without mercy at school, and try to make him go off and take me home, instid o\u0027 taggin\u0027 along after you, when that big-eyed school teacher that sung tenor\u0027d be makin\u0027 sheep\u0027s eyes at you in school, and wantin\u0027 to walk home with you in the evenin\u0027. I remember your slappin\u0027 Si for tellin\u0027 the folks at home about the teacher and you takin\u0027 long walks at noon out to the honeysuckle patch. I\u0027ve a great mind to go in and tell it all to Si right before that feller. Then your cake\u0027ll all be dough. Don\u0027t git too uppish with me, young lady. Gi\u0027 me that plate and let me take it in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The cakes on the griddles burned while Maria watched through the door what she mentally described as the \"arts and manuvers o\u0027 that sassy little piece.\" She was gratified to see that Shorty\u0027s eyes kept glancing at the door for her own reappearance. She carried in the next plate of cakes herself, and though they were a little scorched, Shorty ate them with more zest than any of their predecessors. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si announced, as he shoved back from the table: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, we\u0027ve got to go right off. We must ketch that accommodation and git back to Bean Blossom Crick. I want to say good-by to the folks, and then strike out for Jeffersonville. I\u0027ve reported that I\u0027m able for dooty agin, and there\u0027s orders at home for me and Shorty to go to Jeffersonville and git a gang o\u0027 recruits that\u0027s bin gethered there, and bring \u0027em to the rijimint.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty had been in hopes that Si would dally for a day or so in these pleasant pastures, but then he reflected that where Annabel was was likely to be much more attractive to Si than where she was not. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No need o\u0027 my goin\u0027 back with you,\" he ventured to suggest, speaking for the first time. \"I might take the train goin\u0027 East, and git things in shape at Jeffersonville by the time you come.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then his face grew hot with the thought that everyone saw through his transparent scheme to get an hour or two more with Maria. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Si, decisively. \"You\u0027ll go back with me. Father and mother and \u0027Mandy are all anxious to see you, and they\u0027ll never forgive me if I don\u0027t bring you back with me. Le\u0027s start.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n If, at parting. Shorty had mustered up courage enough to look Maria squarely in the eyes, he might have read something there to encourage him, but no deeply-smitten man ever can do this. There is where the \"light o\u0027 loves\" have the great advantage. He could only grip her hand convulsively for an instant, and then turn and follow Si. \\n\\n \\n\\n At the Deacon\u0027s home Shorty found the same quiet, warm welcome, with too much tact on the part of anyone except little Sammy Woggles to make any comment on the circumstances of his disappearance. Sammy was clearly of the opinion that Si had run down Shorty and brought him back, and this had the beneficial effect of dampening Sammy\u0027s runaway schemes. He was also incensed at Shorty\u0027s perfidy in not sending him the rebel gun, and thought that his being brought back was righteous retribution. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Served you right, you black-hearted promise-breaker,\" he hissed at Shorty when they found themselves momentarily alone. \"I writ you that letter, and it nearly killed me—brung me down with the measles, and you never sent me that gun. But I\u0027ll foller yer trail till you do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be a little fool, Sammy. You stay right here. You\u0027ve got the best home in the world here. If you do I\u0027ll send you your gun inside of a month, with some real rebel catridges and a bayonet that\u0027s killed a man, and a catridge-box with a belt that you kin carry your ammunition in—that is, if you\u0027ll write me another letter, all about Maria.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I won\u0027t write you a word about Maria,\" said the youth, seeing his advantage, \"onless you promise to send me a whole lot o\u0027 catridges—a hatful. Powder and lead costs a heap o\u0027 money. And so do caps.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I\u0027ll Send You a Catridge and Cap for Every Word You Write About Maria. 213 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You shall have \u0027em. I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. I\u0027ll send you a catridge and cap for every word you write about Maria.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a go,\" said the delighted boy. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to learn someway to write without bitin\u0027 my tongue, an\u0027 I\u0027ll write you as many words every day as I want catridges to shoot off, so that I\u0027ll have enough for the next Fourth o\u0027 July, and kill all old Pete Walker\u0027s snappin\u0027 dogs besides.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys were to leave on the midnight train. The bigger part of Si\u0027s leave-taking seemed to be outside of his family, for he quit the house immediately after supper and did not leave Annabel\u0027s side until he had just barely time to get back home, take leave of his weeping mother and help store in the spring wagon more than he and Shorty could carry of the good things she had provided for them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s this?\" said Si to Shorty the next day at Jeffersonville, when they had reported to the Provost-Marshal, and had mustered before them the squad of recruits that they were to conduct to their regiment. \"Have they bin roundin\u0027 up some country school-houses, and enlisted all the boys that was in the fourth reader and Ray\u0027s arithmetic?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Seems like it,\" said Shorty, looking down the line of bright, beardless, callow faces. \"Some o\u0027 them don\u0027t look as if they\u0027d got as fur as the fourth reader. Ain\u0027t old enough to spell words o\u0027 more than two syllables. What do they want with so many drummer-boys?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We aint no drummer-boys,\" said a bright-faced five-footer, who overhead the question. \"Nary drum for us. We haint got no ear for music. We\u0027re regular soldiers, we are, and don\u0027t you forget it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you ain\u0027t nigh 18,\" said Si, looking him over, pleased with the boy\u0027s spirit. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You bet I\u0027m over 18,\" answered the boy. \"I told the Mustering Officer I was, and stuck to it in spite of him. There, you can see for yourself that I am,\" and he turned up his foot so as to show a large 18 marked on the sole of his shoe. \"There, if that don\u0027t make me over 18, I\u0027d like to know what does,\" he added triumphantly, to the chorus of laughter from his companions. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the entire squad of 65 there were not more than half a dozen bearded men. The rest were boys, all clearly under their majority, and many seeming not over 15. There were tall, lathy boys, with tallowy faces; there were short, stocky boys, with big legs and arms and fat faces as red as ripe apples, and there were boys neither very fat nor very lean, but active and sprightly as cats. They were in the majority. Long and short, fat and lean, they were all bubbling over with animal spirits and activity, and eager to get where they could see \"real war.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say, mister,\" said the irrepressible five-footer, who had first spoken to Si; \"we\u0027ve bin awful anxious for you to come and take us to our regiment. We want to begin to be real soldiers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, my boy,\" said Si, with as much paternalism as if he had been a grandfather, \"you must begin right now, by actin\u0027 like a real soldier. First, you mustn\u0027t call me mister. Mustn\u0027t call nobody mister in the army. My name\u0027s Sergeant Klegg. This other man is Corporal Elliott, You must always call us by those names, When you speak to either of us you must take the position of a soldier—stand up straight, put your heels together, turn your toes out, and salute, this way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is this right?\" asked the boy, carefully imitating Si. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, that\u0027s purty near right—very good for first attempt. Now, when I speak to you, you salute and answer me. What is your name?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Henry Joslyn, sir.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Henry, you are now Private Joslyn, of the 200th Injianny Volunteer Infantry. I can\u0027t tell what company you\u0027ll belong to till we git to the rigimint, but I\u0027ll try to have you in Co. Q, my company.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But when are we going to get our guns and knapsacks and things, and start for the regiment?\" persisted the eager boy, and the others joined in the impatient inquiry. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You won\u0027t git your guns and accourterments till you git to the rigimint. As soon\u0027s I kin go over this roll and identify each one o\u0027 you, I\u0027ll see what the orders is for starting.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There goes some men for the ferry now. Why can\u0027t we go with them?\" persisted the boy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Private Joslyn,\" said Si, with some official sternness, \"the first thing a soldier\u0027s got to learn is to keep quiet and wait for orders. You understand?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Pears to me that there\u0027s a lot o\u0027 first things to learn,\" grumbled the boy to the others, \"and it\u0027s nothin\u0027 but wait, wait forever. The army\u0027ll go off and leave us if we don\u0027t get down there purty soon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry, my boy, about the army goin\u0027 off and leavin\u0027 you,\" said Shorty in a kindly way. \"It\u0027ll wait. It kin be depended on for that. Besides, it\u0027s got to wait for me and Sargint Klegg.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s so. Didn\u0027t think o\u0027 that,\" chorused the boys, to whose eyes the two veterans seemed as important as Gens. Grant or Thomas. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s purty light material for serious bizniss, I\u0027m afeared,\" said Shorty to Si, as they stood a little apart for a moment and surveyed the coltish boys, frisking around in their new blouses and pantaloons, which fitted about like the traditional shirt on a bean-pole. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think they\u0027re just splendid,\" said Si, enthusiastically. \"They\u0027ll fill in the holes o\u0027 the old rigimint in great shape. They\u0027re as tough as little wildcats; they\u0027ll obey orders and go wherever you send \u0027em, and four out o\u0027 every five o\u0027 them kin knock over a crow at a hundred yards with a squirrel rifle. But, Shorty,\" he added with a sudden assumption of paternal dignity, \"me and you\u0027s got to be fathers to them. We\u0027ve got a great responsibility for them. We must do the very best we kin by \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s so,\" said Shorty, catching at once the fatherly feeling. \"I\u0027ll punch the head off en the first sneezer that I ketch tryin\u0027 to impose on \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63289.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
