{"id":45088,"no":53,"title":"CHAPTER VI. LETTER FROM HOME","content":"THE DEACON\u0027S TROUBLES IN GETTING HOME WITH ABRAHAM LINCOLN. \\n\\n \\n\\n ONE MORNING the Orderly-Sergeant handed Si the following letter: \\n\\n \\n\\n Deer Son: I got hoam safely a weke ago, thanks 2 all-protecting Providens; likewise 2 about 175 pound of tuff \u0026 helthy Josiah Klegg. Providens helpt rite along, but it tuk 50-year-old Injianny hickory \u0026 whit-leather 2 pull through sum ov the tite plasis. \\n\\n \\n\\n Abraham Lincoln is as strong as an ox, but I never thought that anything that diddent wear horns or chew the cud could be so measly dumb. He kin eat as much as Buck, our off-steer, \u0026 I declare I don\u0027t believe he knows any more. \\n\\n \\n\\n We had only bin on the train long enuff for Abe to finish up the whole of the 3 days rations you provided us with 2 last us home, when I notist that Blowhard Billings was on board. He was still dressed in full uniform, \u0026 playin off officer yit, but I happened 2 recolleck that he was no officer no more, \u0026 it wuz lucky that I done so. He wuz lookin at me \u0026 Abe hard with them mean, fatfish ize ov hizn. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jest as a matter ov precaushon. I make Abe change seats with me \u0026 taik the inside. Billings85 caim up. You know what I thought ov him ov old, \u0026 there\u0027s never bin any love lost betwixt us sence I stopped him cheatin poor Eli Mitchell outen his plow-team. I told him then that the coppers on a dead nigger\u0027s eyes wuzzent saif when he wuz around, \u0026 I woulddent trust him ez fur ez I could sling a bull by the tale. He got mad at this \u0026 never got over it. I never encouraged him to. I woulddent feel satisfied with myself if he wuzzent mad at me. I coulddent change my opinion, even when he tried to steal into respectability by goin into the army. I knowed he\u0027d do anything but fite, \u0026 woulddent\u0027ve bin supprized any day by hearing that him and the other mules in camp had disappeared together. \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently Billings he cum up very corjil like \u0026 says: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Howdy, Deacon. I hope you air very well.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I told him I wuz tollable peart, and he says: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see a man in the third car forward that wuz inquiring for you, and wanted to see you powerful bad.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That so?\" says I, unconcernedlike. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" says he. \"He wuz awful anxious to see you, and I said I\u0027d send you to him if I cum acrost you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Somehow, I dropped onto it in a minnit that he wuz schemin\u0027 to git me away from Abraham Lincoln— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" says I, \"it\u0027s about ez fur for me forward to him as it is for him back here to me. I don\u0027t know as I want to see him at all. If he wants to see me so bad let him cum back here.\"86 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think I\u0027d go forward and see him,\" said Billings, sort ov impatient-like. \"You\u0027ll have no trouble finding him. He\u0027s in the third car from here, up at the front end, right-hand side, next to the watercooler. He inquired most partickerlerly for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Probably he wants 2 borry money,\" says I, without stirrin\u0027. \"Men that want particularly 2 see me always do. Well, I hain\u0027t got none 2 lend—hain\u0027t got no more\u0027n \u0027ll talk me hoam.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027d better go forward \u0026 see him,\" he said very bossy like, as if he was orderin me. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027d better stay right here, \u0026 I\u0027m goin\u0027 to stay,\" says I, so decided that Billings see that it was no use. \\n\\n \\n\\n His patience gave clean away. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look here, Klegg,\" said he, mad as a hornet, \"I\u0027m after that ere nigger you\u0027re trying to steal away into Injianny, and by the holy poker I\u0027m goin\u0027 to have him! Come along here, you black ape,\" and he laid his hand on Abe Lincoln\u0027s collar. Abe showed the white ov his eyes as big as buckeyes, put his arm around the piece betwixt the winders, and held on for deer life. I see by the grip he tuk that the only way 2 git him wuz 2 tear out the side of the car, and I thought I\u0027d let them tussle it out for a minnit or 2. \\n\\n \\n\\n The others in the car who thought it grate fun to see a Lieutenant-Kurnol wrastlin\u0027 with a nigger, laffed and yelled: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go it, nigger,\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go it, Kurnel,\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Grab a root,\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027l bet on the nigger if the car is stout onuf,\"87 and sich. Jest then Groundhog cum runnin\u0027 up to help Billings, and reached over and ketched Abe, but I hit him a good biff with the musket that changed his mind. Billings turned on me, and called out to the others: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Men, I order you to arrest this man and tie him up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Sum ov them seemed a-mind to obey, but I sung out: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Feller-citizens, he ain\u0027t no officer—no more\u0027n I am. He ain\u0027t got no right to wear shoulder-straps, and he knows it as well as I do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At this they all turned agin him \u0026 began yellin at him 2 put his head in a bag. He turned 2 me savage as a meat-ax, but I ketched him by the throat, \u0026 bent him back over the seat. The Provo-Guard cum up, \u0026 I explained it 2 them, \u0026 showed my passes for me \u0026 Abe. So they made us all sit down \u0026 keep quiet. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bimeby we got to Nashville. Abe Lincoln wuz hungry, \u0026 I stopped 2 git him something to eat. My gracious, the lot ov ham \u0026 aigs at 50 cents a plate \u0026 sandwiches at 25 cents a piece that contraband kin eat. He never seemed 2 git full. He looked longingly at the pies, but I let him look. I wuzzent runnin no Astor House in connexion with the Freedmen\u0027s buro. \\n\\n \\n\\n We walked through the city, crost on the ferry, \u0026 wuz jest gittin in the cars which wuz about ready 2 start, when up comes Billings agin, with 2 or 3 other men in citizen\u0027s cloze. One ov these claps his hand on my shoulder \u0026 says: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m a Constable, \u0026 I arrest you in the name ov88 the State ov Tennessee for abductin a slave. Make no trubble, but come along with me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I jest shook him off, \u0026 clumb onto the platform, pullin Abe after me. The Constable \u0026 his men follered us, but I got Abe Lincoln inside the door, shet it \u0026 made him put his shoulders agin it. The Constable \u0026 his 2 assistants wuz buttin away at it, \u0026 me grinnin at them when the train pulled off, \u0026 they had 2 jump off. I begin 2 think there wuz something good in Abe Lincoln, after all, \u0026 when we stopped at an eatin-plais, about half-way 2 Louisville, \u0026 Abe looked at the grub as if he haddent had a mouthful sence the war begun, I busted a $2-bill all 2 pieces gittin\u0027 him a little supper. If I wuz goin into the bizniss ov freein slaves I\u0027d want 2 have a mule train haulin grub follering me at every step. \\n\\n \\n\\n Abe wuz awful hungry agin when we reached Louisville, but I found a place where a dollar would buy him enuf pork \u0026 beans 2 probably last him over the river. \\n\\n \\n\\n But I begun 2 be efeard that sum nosin pryin Mike Medler might make trubble in gitting Abe safely acrost the Ohio. I tuk him 2 a house, \u0026 laid it down strong 2 him that he must stay inside all day, and 2 make sure I bargained with the woman 2 keep him eating as much as she could. I ruined a $5 bill, \u0026 even then Abe looked as if he could hold some more. I\u0027ve always made it a pint 2 lend 2 the Lord for the benefit ov the heathen as much as my means would allow, but I begun 2 think that my missionary contribushions this year would beat what I was layin out on my family.89 \\n\\n \\n\\n After it got dark, me \u0026 Abe meandered down through the streets 2 the ferry. There wuzzent many people out, except soljers, \u0026 I\u0027ve got 2 feel purty much at home with them. They seem more likely 2 think more nearly my way than folks in every-day clothes. \\n\\n \\n\\n There wuz quite a passel ov soljers on the wharf boat waitin\u0027 for the ferry when we got there. They saw at wuns that I had probably bin down 2 the front 2 see my son, \u0026 sum ov them axed me 2 what rigiment he belonged. When I told them the 200th Injianny Volunteer Infantry they all made friends with me at wunst, for they said they knowed it wuz a good rigiment. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bimeby a big, important-lookin\u0027 man, with a club with a silver head for a cane, cum elbowin through the crowd \u0026 scowling at everybody as if he owned the wharf-boat \u0026 all on it. He stopped in frunt ov Abraham Lincoln \u0026 says very sharp \u0026 cross: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Boy, where did you come from?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abe diddent say nothin\u0027. His ize got all white, he grinned sort ov scared like, showed his white teeth, \u0026 looked sickly over at me. I spoke up \u0026 says: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I brung him along with me from Murfreesboro\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So I sposed,\" said he. \"He\u0027s a slave you\u0027re tryin 2 steal from his master. You can\u0027t do it. I\u0027ll jest take charge ov him myself. That\u0027s my dooty here,\" \u0026 he ketched hold ov Abraham Lincoln\u0027s collar. Abe, in his scare, put out his arms to ketch hold ov something, \u0026 throwed them around the big important man, \u0026 lifted him clean offen his feet. I never before realized how strong Abe wuz. The soljers gethered around, purty mad, and then laffin and90 yellin when they see the man in Abe\u0027s arms. Suddenly sum one hollered: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Throw him overboard; throw him in the river.\" Abe was wuss scared than ever when he found he had the man in his arms. He wuz afeared 2 hold on \u0026 still more afeared 2 let go. He heard them hollerin, \u0026 thought he had 2 do jest as they said, \u0026 begun edgin toward the river. \\n\\n \\n\\n The man got more scared than Abe. He began kickin \u0026 wrigglin \u0026 hollerin: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t let him do it. Help me. I can\u0027t swim a lick.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At this the men hollered worsen ever: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Throw him in the river! Duck him! Baptize him! Drown him!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I\u0027m a Baptist, but I don\u0027t believe in immersion onless the convert has bin prepared for it, \u0026 is willin, which neither this man wuz. I stepped forward 2 make Abe let him down, but before T could do anything Abe had got 2 the edge of the wharfboat \u0026 let go, \u0026 plunk went the man into about 10 foot ov water. Abe, scared now nearly 2 death, stood there with his ize biggern sassers \u0026 whitern goose-eggs. \\n\\n \\n\\n In a minnit the man cum up, sputterin \u0026 hollerin. A big Sergeant, with his left arm in a sling, reached over \u0026 ketchod him by the collar \u0026 held his head above water. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If I pull you out will you promis 2 go out ov the niggor-kotchin bizniss forever?\" axed the Sergeant. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pull me out \u0026 then I\u0027ll talk 2 you,\" says the man grabbin for the slippery sides ov the wharfboat.91 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I won\u0027t,\" said the Sergeant, sousin him under water agin. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, yes, I\u0027ll promise,\" says the man, when he come up agin. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will you swear it?\" axed the Sergeant. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I\u0027ll swear it before a Justice ov the Peace.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will you swear 2 support the Constitution ov the United States agin all enemies \u0026 opposers whatsumever, \u0026 vote for Abraham Lincoln every time?\" axed the Sergeant. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take the oath ov allegiance,\" says the man, sputterin the water out ov his mouth, \"but I\u0027ll never vote for that Abolition ape as long as I live.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then down you go,\" says the Sergeant, sousin him again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, yes, I\u0027ll vote for Abe Lincoln, \u0026 anybody else, if you\u0027ll only pull me out,\" said the man, in a tired tone of voice, when he cum up agin. I begin 2 see that immersion had a great deal ov good in it, even if a man isn\u0027t prepared \u0026 willin. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will you swear 2 always love a nigger as a man \u0026 a brother, until death do you part, \u0026 aid \u0026 comfort all them who are tryin 2 git away from slavery?\" axed the Sergeant. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Damned if I will,\" says the man. \"No nigger kin ever be a brother 2 me. I\u0027ll die first.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you\u0027ll die right now,\" says the Sergeant, sendin him down as far as his long arm would reach \u0026 holding him there until I wuz scared for fear he wuz really goin 2 drown the man. When he brung him up the man whimpered: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, only pull me out—save my life—\u0026 I\u0027ll do anything you want.\"92 \\n\\n \\n\\n By this time the ferryboat had cum up. We got aboard \u0026 crost over to Injianny, \u0026 I felt so glad at bein on my nativ soil wuns more that I took Abe up 2 the eatin stand, \u0026 blowed in a dollar filin up the vacant plasis in his hide. \\n\\n \\n\\n When we tried 2 git on the train there cum another trubble: The conductor woulddent let him ride in the car with white folks—not even in the smokin-car. He made him go into the baggage-car. Abe wuz so scared about leavin me for a minnit in\u0027 that strange country that I tried 2 go into the baggage-car with him, but the conductor woulddent let me. He said it wuz agin the rules for passengers to ride in the baggage-cars, but Abe could go in there, same as dogs, prize poultry, \u0026 household pets. I tried 2 joke with him, tellin him that in sum plasis I wuz considered a household pet, but he said Ide have 2 git another mug on me before he could believe it. \\n\\n \\n\\n One of Zeke Biltner\u0027s hogs ditched the train jest before we got home, \u0026 turned the baggage-car over. Sum crates ov aigs wuz smashed over Abraham Lincoln, \u0026 he wuz a sight to behold. He wuz awfully scared, though, \u0026 begged me 2 let him go the rest ov the way on foot. He said he wuz a thousand years older than when he left his ole massa, \u0026 I could understand what he meant. \\n\\n \\n\\n I found your mother \u0026 the girls bright \u0026 chipper \u0026 jest tickled 2 death to see me safe back. They axed me so many questions about you \u0026 Shorty that my head buzzed like a bee-hive. It is hard 2 git away from them 2 tend 2 my Spring work, but I\u0027ve made an arrangement 2 giv em an hour mornin93 \u0026 evenin 2 answerin questions. I think this will keep me purty busy till the snow flise agin. \\n\\n \\n\\n Wheat is lookin surprisinly well, though I found sum bare plasis in the north field. I think we\u0027ll have a fair crop ov apples and peaches. Your colt is growin up the purtiest thing that ever went on four legs, \u0026 jumped an eight-rail fence. My hogs wintered in good shape, \u0026 pork is risin. They have the measles over on the Crick, \u0026 school\u0027s broke up. Bill Scripp\u0027s out agin for Sheriff, \u0026 I spose I\u0027le have 2 turn 2 agin \u0026 beat him. Singler, that he\u0027ll never know when he\u0027s got enuff. \\n\\n \\n\\n If anything, Abraham Lincoln\u0027s appetite has bin improved by Wabash air. I wuzzent goin 2 have the wimmen folks wear theirselves out cookin for him. So I fix-ed up a place for him in the old log house, \u0026 took him over some sides ov meat, a few bushel ov pertaters, a jug ov sorghum molasses, \u0026 every time mother bakes she sends over some leaves ov bread. I jest turned him loose there. He seems 2 be very happy, \u0026 we hear him singin \u0026 yellin most all the time when he\u0027s by hisself. He\u0027s a good worker when I stand right over him, \u0026 he\u0027ll lift \u0026 dig as patient as an ox. But he hain\u0027t no more sense about goin ahead by hisself than a steer has, \u0026 the moment my back\u0027s turned he stops work. Ime af eared I\u0027ve got a job on my hands makin a firstclass farmer out ov him. But if that\u0027s my share ov the work that Providens has chalked out for me, there\u0027s nothin left for me but 2 go ahead \u0026 do it in fear \u0026 tremblin. \\n\\n \\n\\n No more from your affeckshionate father. \\n\\n \\n\\n P. S. Give my best respects 2 Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63240.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
