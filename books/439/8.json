{"id":45043,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VII. IN THE AWKWARD SQUAD","content":"SI HAS MANY TRIBULATIONS LEARNING THE MANUAL OP ARMS. WHEN Si Klegg went into active service with Co. Q of the 200th Ind. his ideas of drill and tactics were exceedingly vague. He knew that a \"drill\" was something to make holes with, and as he understood that he had been sent down South to make holes through people, he supposed drilling had something to do with it. He handled his musket very much as he would a hoe. A \"platoon\" might be something to eat, for all he knew. He had a notion that a \"wheel\" was something that went around, and he thought a \"file\" was a screeching thing that his father used once a year to sharpen up the old buck saw. The fact was that Si and his companions hardly had a fair shake in this respect, and entered the field at a decided disadvantage. It had been customary for a regiment to be constantly drilled for a month or two in camp in its own State before being sent to the front; but the 200th was rushed off to Kentucky the very day it was mustered in. This was while the cold chills were running up and down the backs of the people in the North on account of the threatened invasion by Bragg\u0027s army. The regiment pushed after the fleeing rebels, but whenever Suell\u0027s army halted to take breath, \"Fall in for drill!\" was shouted through its camp three or four times a day. It was liable to be called into action at any moment, and it was deemed indispensable to begin at once the process of making soldiers out of those tender-footed Hoosiers, whose zeal and patriotism as yet far exceeded their knowledge of military things. Most of the officers of the 200th were as green as the men, though some of them had seen service in other regiments; so, at first, officers and non-commissioned officers who had been in the field a few months and were considered veterans, and who knew, or thought they knew, all about tactics that was worth knowing, were detailed from the old regiments to put the boys through a course of sprouts in company and squad drill. One morning three or four days after leaving Louisville, word was passed around that the regiment would not move that day, and the boys were so glad at the prospect of a day of rest that they wanted to get right up and yell. Si was sitting on a log, with his shoes off, rubbing his aching limbs and nursing his blisters, when the Orderly came along. \"Co. Q, be ready in 10 minutes to fall in for drill. Stir around, you men, and get your traps on. Klegg, put on them gunboats, and be lively about it.\" \"Orderly,\" said Si, looking as if he hadn\u0027t a friend on earth, \"just look at them blisters; I can\u0027t drill to-day!\" \"You\u0027ll have to or go to the guard-house,\" was the reply. \"You\u0027d better hustle yourself, too!\" Si couldn\u0027t think of anything to say that would do justice to his feelings; and so, with wailing and gnashing of teeth, and a few muttered words that he didn\u0027t learn in Sunday school, he got ready to take his place in the company. As a general combustion of powder by the armies of Buell and Bragg was hourly expected, it was thought best for the 200th to learn first something about shooting. If called suddenly into action it was believed the boys could \"git thar,\" though they had not yet mastered the science of company and battalion evolutions. Co. Q was divided into squads of eight for exercise in the manual of arms. The man who took Si\u0027s squad was a grizzled Sergeant, who had been \"lugging knapsack, box and gun\" for a year. He fully realized his important and responsible functions as instructor of these innocent youths, having at the same time a supreme contempt for their ignorance. \"Attention, Squad!\" and they all looked at him in a way that meant business. \u0027right Shoulder Shift--arms!\u0027 067 \"Load in nine times—Load!\" Si couldn\u0027t quite understand what the \"in\" meant, but he had always been handy with a shotgun, to the terror of the squirrels and coons up in Posey County, and he thought he would show the Sergeant how spry he was. So he rammed in a cartridge, put on a cap, held up his musket, and blazed away, and then went to loading again as if his life depended upon his activity. For an instant the Sergeant was speechless with amazement. At length his tongue was loosened, and he roared out: \"What in the name of General Jackson are you doing, you measly idiot! Who ordered you to load and fire your piece?\" \"I—I th—thought you did!\" said Si, trembling as if he had the Wabash ague. \"You said for us to load nine times. I thought nine loads would fill \u0027er chuck full and bust \u0027er and I didn\u0027t see any way but to shute \u0027em oft as fast as I got \u0027em in.\" \"No, sir! I gave the command according to Hardee, \u0027Load—in—nine—times!\u0027 and ef yer hadn\u0027t bin in such a hurry you\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 found out what that means. Yer\u0027ll git along a good deal faster ef you\u0027ll go slower. Yer ought ter be made ter carry a rail, and a big one, for two hours.\" Si protested that he was sorry, and didn\u0027t mean to, and wouldn\u0027t do so again, and the drill went on. The master went through all the nine \"times\" of \"Handle—Cartridge!\" \"Draw—Rammer!\" etc., each with its two or three \"motions.\" It seemed like nonsense to Si. \"Boss,\" said he, \"I kin get \u0027er loaded in just half the time ef yer\u0027ll let me do it my own way!\" \"Silence!\"\u0027 thundered the Sergeant. \"If you speak another word I\u0027ll have ye gagged \u0027n\u0027 tied up by the thumbs!\" Si had always been used to speaking right out when he had anything to say, and had not yet got his \"unruly member\" under thorough subjection. He saw that it wouldn\u0027t do to fool with the Drill Sergeant, however, and he held his peace. But Si kept thinking that if he got into a fight he would ram in the cartridge and fire them out as fast as he could, without bothering his head about the \"one time and three motions.\" \u0027fix--bayonets!\u0027 069 \"Order—Arms!\" commanded the Sergeant, after he had explained how it was to be done. Si brought his gun down along with the rest like a pile-driver, and it landed squarely on the foot of the man next to him. Brought his Gun Down on the Man\u0027s Foot 065 \"Ou-ou-ouch!\" remarked the victim of Si\u0027s inexperience. \"Didn\u0027t do it a\u0027purpose, pard,\" said Si compassionately; \"\u0027pon my word I didn\u0027t. I\u0027ll be more keerful after this.\" His suffering comrade, in very pointed language, urged upon Si the propriety of exercising a little more care. He determined that he would manage to get some other fellow to stand next to Si after that. \"Shoulder—Arms!\" ordered the Sergeant, and the guns came straggling up into position. Then, after a few words of instruction, \"Right shoulder shift—Arms!\" \"Don\u0027t you know your right shoulder?\" said the Sergeant, with a good deal of vinegar in his tone, to Si, who had his gun on the \"larboard\" side, as a sailor would say. \"Beg yer pardon,\" said Si; \"I always was lefthanded. I\u0027ll learn if yer only gimme a show!\" \"Silence!\" again roared the Sergeant. \"One more word, sir, and I will tie ye up, fer a fact!\" The Sergeant got his squad down to an \"order arms\" again, and then, after showing them how, he gave the order, \"Fix—Bayonets!\" There was the usual clicking and clattering, during which Si dexterously managed to stick his bayonet into the eye of his comrade, whose toes were still aching from the blow of the butt of Si\u0027s musket. Si assured him he was sorry, and that it was all a mistake, but his comrade thought the limit of patience had been passed. So he confidently informed Si that as soon as drill was over he was going to \"pound the stuffin\u0027\" out of him, and there wouldn\u0027t be any mistake about it, either. When the hour was up the Captain of the company came around to see how the boys were getting along. The upshot of it was that poor Si was immediately organized into an \"awkward squad\" all by himself, and drilled an extra hour. \"We\u0027ll see, Mr. Klegg,\" said the Captain, \"if you can\u0027t learn to handle your arms without mashing the toes and stabbing the eyes out of the rest of the company.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63195.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
