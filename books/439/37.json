{"id":45072,"no":37,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. \"HOOSIER\u0027S REST\"","content":"SI AND SHORTY CHRISTEN THEIR PLACE AND GIVE A HOUSE-WARMING. \n \n WITH a tin roof, a real door, a glazed window and a plank floor, Si and Shorty\u0027s house was by far the most aristocratic in the cantonment of the 200th Ind., if not the entire Winter quarters of the Army of the Cumberland. A marble mansion, with all the modern improvements, could not more proudly overshadow all its neighbors than it did. \n \n Even the Colonel\u0027s was no comparison to it. A tent-fly had been made to do duty for a roof at the Colonel\u0027s. It could not be stretched evenly and tight. It would persistently sag down in spots, and each of these spots became a reservoir from which would descend an icy stream. A blanket had to serve as a door, and the best substitute for window glass were Commissary blanks greased with fat from headquarters\u0027 frying-pan. The floor, instead of being of clean, new plank, as Si\u0027s and Shorty\u0027s, was made of the warped and weather-beaten boards of a stable, which had been torn down by a fatigue detail. \n \n Si and Shorty took as much pride and pleasure in their architecture as any nabob over his million-dollar villa. They were constantly on the alert for anything that would add to the comfort and luxury151 of their home. In their wanderings they chanced to come across an old-fashioned bedstead in an out house. It was of the kind in which the rails screw together, and the bed is held up by a strong cord crossing and recrossing from one rail to another. This looked like real luxury, and they at once appropriated it without any consultation with the owner, whoever he may have been. \n \n \"It\u0027d be a waste o\u0027 time, anyhow,\" remarked Shorty. \"He\u0027s a rebel, and probably over there in Bragg\u0027s army.\" \n \n They made a tick out of the piece of wagon-cover, filled it with beech leaves, and had a bed which surpassed their most extravagant ideas of comfort in the army. \n \n \"Shorty,\" said Si, as they snugged themselves in the first night, \"this seems almost too much. Do you ever remember settin\u0027 the whole night on a rail, with nothin\u0027 over us but clouds leakin\u0027 ice-water?\" \n \n \"Shut up,\" said Shorty, giving him a kick under the blankets. \"Do you want me to have a night mare?\" \n \n They got a number of flat stones, and laid down a little pavement in front of their door, and drove an old bayonet into the logs to serve as a scraper. They rigorously insisted on every visitor using this before entering. \n \n \"For common Wabash-bottom fly-up-the-cricks and private soljers, you\u0027re puttin\u0027 on entirely too many frills,\" said Sol Murphy, the Wagonmaster, angrily, as it was firmly insisted upon that he stay outside until he carefully cleaned his shoes on the bayonet. \"A man that\u0027s afraid o\u0027 mud hain\u0027t no152 business in the army. He orter stay at home an\u0027 wear Congress gaiters an\u0027 pantalets. You\u0027re puttin\u0027 on too many scollops, I tell you. You knowed all \u0027bout mud in the Wabash bottoms. You had \u0027nuff of it there, the Lord knows.\" \n \n \"Yes, we had,\" replied Shorty; \"but we was too well raised to track it into anybody\u0027s parlor.\" \n \n \"Parlor,\" echoed Sol, with a horse-laugh. \"Lord, how fine we are, just becaze one o\u0027 us happens to be a measly little Corporal. In some armies the Wagonmasters have Corporals to wait on \u0027em an\u0027 black their boots. Now, I\u0027ll tell yo\u0027 what I\u0027ve come for. I\u0027ve lost my scoop-shovel, an\u0027 I\u0027ve bin told that you fellers stole it, an\u0027 are usin\u0027 it to bake hoe-cakes on. I\u0027ve come up here to see if you\u0027ve got it, an\u0027 I\u0027m goin\u0027 right in there to see for myself, mud or no mud.\" \n \n \"We hain\u0027t got your blamed old scoop-shovel; you can\u0027t git it; you ain\u0027t goin\u0027 in there until you clean your feet, an\u0027 not then onless we conclude to allow you,\" Shorty replied. \n \n \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 in there, or break some Wabash loon\u0027s neck,\" said the Wagonmaster wrathfully. \n \n \"I always did like to get a chance to lick a mule-whacker,\" said Si, pulling off his overcoat. \"And the bigger and the more consequential he is, the better. I\u0027ve never licked a Wagonmaster yit, an\u0027 I\u0027m just achin\u0027 for a chance.\" \n \n The Wagonmaster was the bully of the regiment, as Wagonmasters generally are. When Si came into the regiment, a green cub, just getting his growth, and afraid of everybody who assumed a little authority and had more knowledge of the world than he, the Wagonmaster had been very153 overbearing, and at times abusive. That is the way of Wagonmasters and their ilk. The remembrance of this rankled in Si\u0027s mind. \n \n On the other hand, the Wagonmaster failed to comprehend the change that a few months of such service as the 200th Ind.\u0027s wrought in verdant, bashful boys like Si. He thought he could cow him as easily as he did when Si had timidly ventured to ask His Greatness a modest question or two as they were crossing the Ohio River. Wagonmasters were always making just that kind of mistakes. \n \n The other boys ran up to see the fun. The Wagonmaster made a rush for Si with doubled fists, but Si quickly stepped to one side, and gave the hulking fellow a tap on the butt of his ear that laid him over in the mud. The other boys yelled with delight. Next to a Sutler, or a conceited, fresh young Aid, the soldiers always delighted to see a Wagonmaster get into trouble. \n \n Si Floors the Wagonmaster. 154 \n \n The Wagonmaster sprang up, ready for another round; but the boys raised the cry that the Officer of the Day was coming, and both Si and the Wagonmaster remembered that they had business in other parts of the camp. \n \n The next day Shorty said: \"It\u0027s all right, Si; we could\u0027ve kept that scoop-shovel as long as we wanted to, but I thought that for many reasons it\u0027d better be got out of the regiment, so I\u0027ve traded it to them Maumee Muskrats for a Dutch oven they\u0027d borrowed from their Major.\" \n \n \"Bully,\" answered Si. \"I\u0027d much rather have the Dutch oven, anyway.\" \n \n Si produced a piece of board, which had been154 painted white, and evidently done duty as part of the door of a house in Murfreesboro\u0027, looked at it critically, and then selected a piece of charcoal from the fire, and sat down with an air of studious purpose. \"What are you up to now, Si?\" asked Shorty curiously. \n \n \"Why,\" explained Si, \"I\u0027ve noticed, whenever we\u0027ve bin in any big place, that all the fine houses have signs or numbers, or something else onto \u0027em, to name \u0027em. I\u0027ve bin thinkin\u0027 o\u0027 something for155 our house. How does \u0027Hoosier\u0027s Rest\u0027 strike you for a name?\" \n \n \"Splendid,\" said Shorty. \"Couldn\u0027t be better.\" \n \n \"And,\" continued Si, \"I\u0027ve got this board to make a sign to nail up over the door. Do you know how to spell Hoosier, Shorty?\" \n \n \"Blest if I do,\" answered Shorty. \"It wasn\u0027t in our book. At least, we never got to it, if it was. You see our spellin\u0027-school broke up just as we got to \u0027incompatible.\u0027 The teacher got too fond o\u0027 Nancy Billings, that I was castin\u0027 sheep\u0027s eyes at myself. He got to givin\u0027 her easy words, to keep her at the head o\u0027 the class, and pickin\u0027 hard ones for me, to send me to the foot, where I\u0027d be fur away from her. I wouldn\u0027t stand it always, so me an\u0027 him had it out one night before all the scholars; I got away with him, and he left the country, and busted up the school.\" \n \n \"Hoosier,\" repeated Si to himself. \"I never saw it spelled. But there must be some way to spell it. Let me see: \u0027W-h-o spells who.\u0027\" \n \n \"That\u0027s so,\" assented Shorty. \n \n \"I-s spells \u0027is,\u0027\" continued Si. \"Who-is that\u0027s right so far. H-e-r-e spells \u0027here.\u0027 \u0027Who-is-here?\u0027 That seems almost right, don\u0027t it, Shorty?\" \n \n \"It certainly does,\" replied Shorty, scratching his head to accelerate his mental action. \"Or it might be, Si, w-h-o, who; i-s, is; and y-e-r, yer. You know some ignorant folks say yer for you. And they say the name came from the people who first settled in Injianny sayin\u0027 \u0027Who\u0027s yer?\u0027 to any new comer.\" \n \n \"I believe you\u0027re right, Shorty,\" said Si, bending156 over the board with the charcoal to begin the work. \"We\u0027ll make it that way, anyway.\" \n \n The next day passers-by saw a white board nailed up over the door, which contained a charcoal sketch of a soldier seated on a chunk of wood, with a pipe in his mouth, taking as much ease as Si could throw into the outlines of his face and body, and with it was this legend: \n \n \"WHO IS YER\u0027S REST.\" \n \n The next idea that came into the partners\u0027 minds was that the requirements of society demanded that they give a housewarming in their sumptuous abode. They at once set about making it a memorable social event. \n \n While out with a wagon after forage they found an Indiana man who had settled in that country. He had a good orchard. They bought from him a barrel of pretty hard cider and several bushels of apples. His wife knew how to make fried dough nuts of real Indiana digestibility. They would be luxuries for the boys, and a half-bushel were contracted for. The farmer was to bring them all in his wagon, and Si and Shorty were to meet him at the pickets and guard the treasures to their abode. \n \n They bought a little bale of fragrant Kinnikinnick tobacco from the sutler, made a sufficiency of corncob pipes, swept off the ground in front of their house, which, as there had been no rain for several days, was in good condition, with brooms of brush, that it might serve for a dancing-floor, gathered in a stock of pitch-pine knots for their fire, spoke157 to Bunty Jim to bring his fiddle along, and to Uncle Sassafras, the Colonel\u0027s cook, to come down with his banjo, and their preparations were completed. \n \n It was a crisp, delightful Winter evening, with the moon at full, the fire burning brightly, and every body in the best of spirits. The awful week of marching, enduring and suffering; of terrific fighting, limitless bloodshed; of wounds and death to one158 out of every four men in the ranks; of nerve-racking anxieties to all might as well have been centuries ago for any sign that appeared on the bright, animated faces of the young men who gathered in front of the cabin. They smoked, danced old-fashioned country dances to the music of the fiddle and the banjo, and sang songs which lamented the death of \"Lily Dale,\" mourned that \"My Nelly was sleeping in the Hazel Dell,\" adjured the \"Silver Moon\" to \"roll on,\" and so on through the whole repertoire of the sentimental ballads of that day. \n \n Then they were invited into the house to inspect its complete, luxurious appointments, and feast themselves to bursting on apples, hard cider, and doughnuts that would have tried any stomach but a young soldier\u0027s. \n \n Billy Gurney, who had been back to Nashville as one of the guard to a train-load of wounded, was induced to favor the company with the newest song, which had just reached that city. He cleared his throat with another tincupful of cider, and started off with: \n \n \"When this cruel war is over.\" \n \n Rapturous applause followed the first verse, and Billy started in to teach them the chorus, so they could all join. \n \n A loud explosion came from the fireplace, a campkettle full of cider that was being mulled by the fire was spattered over the company, scalding some of them severely; stones from the fireplace and bullets flew about the room. They all rushed out.159 Footsteps could be heard running in the distance. They looked in that direction, and recognized Sol Murphy\u0027s broad back and bushy head. \n \n \"That blamed Wagonmaster dropped a nosebag with a lot o\u0027 cartridges in it down the chimbly,\" said Shorty, who had made an inspection of the fireplace. \"Mad because he wasn\u0027t invited. You bet, I\u0027ll salivate him well for that little trick.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63224.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
