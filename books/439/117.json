{"id":45152,"no":117,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. SHORTY WRITES A LETTER TO MARIA KLEGG","content":"AND ENTERS UPON HIS PARENTAL RELATIONS TO LITTLE PETE SKIDMORE. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE self-sufficient, self-reliant Shorty had never before had anything to so completely daze him. \"Ackchelly a letter from Maria Klegg. Writ of her own free will and accord. And she wants to hear from me,\" he murmured, reading the letter over and over again, and scanning the envelope as if by intensity of gaze he would wring more from the mute white paper. The thought was overpowering that it had come directly from her soft hand; that she had written his name upon it; that her lips had touched the stamp upon it. He tenderly folded up the letter and replaced it in the envelope. His thoughts were too tumultuous for him to sit still. He would walk and calm himself. He wrapped the piece of Maria\u0027s dress around the letter, rose and started off. He had gone but a few steps when it seemed to him that he had not caught the full meaning of some of the words in the letter. He sought a secluded place where he could sit down, unseen by any eyes, and read the letter all over again several times. Then came the disturbing thought of how he was to care for and protect the precious missive? He could not bear to part with it for a single minute, and yet he did not want to carry the sacred thing around exposed to the dirt and moil of daily camp-life and the danger of loss. He thought long and earnestly, and at last went down to a large sutler\u0027s store, and purchased the finest morocco wallet from his stock. Even this did not seem a sufficiently rich casket for such a gem, and he bought a large red silk bandana, in which he carefully wrapped letter, dress fragment and wallet, and put them in the pocket of his flannel shirt, next his breast. Next came the momentous duty of writing an answer to the letter. Yesterday he was burning with a desire to make an opportunity to write. Now the opportunity was at hand, the object of his desires had actually asked him to write her, and the completeness of the opportunity unnerved him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The first thing I have got to do,\" said he, \"is to git some paper and envelopes and ink. I don\u0027t s\u0027pose they\u0027ve got anything here fit for a gentleman to write to a lady with.\" He turned over the sutler\u0027s stock of stationery disdainfully, and finally secured a full quire of heavy, gilt-edged paper, and a package of envelopes, on which was depicted a red-and-blue soldier, with a flag in one hand and a gun in the other, charging bayonets through a storm of bursting shells. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s true I ain\u0027t one o\u0027 the color-guard yit,\" mused Shorty, studying the picture, \"but the Colonel sorter hinted that I might be, if Cap McGillicuddy could spare me from Co. Q, which ain\u0027t at all likely. Now, Mister, le\u0027me see some pens.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here\u0027s some—Gillott\u0027s—best quality,\" said the sutler\u0027s clerk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Naw,\" said Shorty contemptuously. \"Don\u0027t want no common steel pens. Goin\u0027 to write to a lady. Git me your best gold ones.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty made quite a pretense of trying, as he had seen penmen do, the temper of the pens upon his thumb-nail, but chose the largest and highest priced one, in an elaborate silver holder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m very partickler \u0027bout my pens,\" said he to the clerk. \"I must have \u0027em to just suit my hand. Some folks\u0027s very keerless about what they write with, but I wasn\u0027t brung up that way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you\u0027d ask my advice,\" said the clerk, \"I\u0027d recommend this thing as the best for you to use. It\u0027d suit fine Italian hand better\u0027n any pen ever made.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And he held up a marking-pot and brush. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Young man,\" said Shorty, solemnly, as he paid for his purchases, \"the condition o\u0027 your health requires you not to try to be funny. It\u0027s one o\u0027 the dangerousest things in the army. You\u0027re exposed to a great many complaints down here, but nothin\u0027 \u0027ll send you to the hospital as suddenly as bein\u0027 funny.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The next thing was a studio where he could conduct his literary task without interruption, and Shorty finally found a rock surrounded by bushes, where he could sit and commune with his thoughts. He got the cover of a cracker-box, to place on his knees and serve for a desk, laid his stationery down beside him, re-read Maria\u0027s letter several times, spoiled several sheets of paper in trying to get his fingers limber enough for chirography, and then, begun the hardest, most anxious afternoon\u0027s work he had ever done, in writing the following letter: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Camp ov the 2 Hunderdth Injianny \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Voluntear Infantry, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mishun Rij, nere Chattynoogy, April the 10, 1864. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Miss Maria Klegg, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Respected Frend. \\n\\n \\n\\n (This part of the letter had cost Shorty nearly an hour of anxious thought. He had at first written \"Dere Miss Maria,\" and then recoiled, shuddered and blushed at the thought of the affectionate familiarity implied. Then he had scrawled, one after another, the whole gamut of beginnings, before he decided upon addressing her, as was her right, as formally as he would the wife of the President.) \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yore letter was welcomer to me than the visit ov the \\n\\n Pamaster, after six months exclipse ov hiz cheerful mug.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n (\"I think \u0027mug\u0027 is the word they use for face in good society,\" mused Shorty, with the end of the penholder in his mouth. \"At least I heard the Kurnel use it one day. She can\u0027t expect no man to be much gladder of anything than the comin\u0027 o\u0027 the Paymaster, and that orter please her.\") \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thankee for yore kind inkwiries az to mi helth? Ime glad to \\n\\n say that Ime all rite, and sound in lung, body and runnin\u0027 \\n\\n gear, and—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n (Shorty was on the point of adding \"Hope that you are enjoying the same blessing,\" when a shiver passed through him that it might be improper to allude to a young lady\u0027s locomotory apparatus. After deep meditation, he took safety\u0027s side and added): \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So\u0027s Si. I sinserely hoap that you are injoyin\u0027 the \\n\\n blessin\u0027s ov helth, and the konsolashuns ov religion.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n (\"I\u0027m not certain about that last,\" thought Shorty, \"but I heard a preacher say it once, and it ought to be all right to write to a young lady.\") \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We are still layin\u0027 in camp, but expectin\u0027 every day orders \\n\\n to move out for a little soshable with Mister Joe Johnston, \\n\\n whose roostin over on Pigeon Mountain. When we git at him, \\n\\n there won\u0027t be no pigeon about it, but a game ov fox-and- \\n\\n geese with us for the foxes. \\n\\n \\n\\n (\"There,\" mused Shorty, complacently; \"that\u0027ll amuse her. Girls like a little fun throwed into letters, when it\u0027s entirely respectful.) \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Little Pete Skidmore is in the company, all rite. He is wun \\n\\n ov the nicest boys that ever lived, but he needs half- \\n\\n killin\u0027 nerely every day. All real nice boys do. Woodent \\n\\n give much for them if they diddent. Tel his mother He look \\n\\n out for him, and fetch him up in the way he shood go, if I \\n\\n haf to break every bone in his body. She needent worry. I no \\n\\n awl about boys. Thair like colts—need to be well-broke \\n\\n before thair enny akount.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n (\"Now,\" commented Shorty, as he read what he had written, \"that\u0027ll make Maria and his mother feel easy in their minds. They\u0027ll think they\u0027re in great luck to git a man who\u0027ll be a second father to Pete, and not risk spilin the child by sparin the rod.\") \\n\\n \\n\\n (\"Great Jehosephat, what work writing to a young lady is. I\u0027d much ruther build breastworks or make roads. Now, if it was some ordinary woman, I wouldn\u0027t have to be careful about my spelin\u0027 and gramer, but with sich a lady as Maria Klegg—great Cesar\u0027s ghost! a man must do the very best that\u0027s in him, and then that ain\u0027t half enough. But I must hurry and finish this letter this afternoon. I can\u0027t git another day off to work at it.\") \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Respected Miss Maria, what a fine writer you are. Yore \\n\\n handwritin\u0027 is the most beautiful I ever seen. Jeb Smith, \\n\\n our company clerk, thinks that he can sFlink ink to beat old \\n\\n Spencerian System hisself, but he ain\u0027t once with you. Ide \\n\\n ruther see one line ov your beautiful ritin\u0027 than all that \\n\\n he ever writ.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n (\"That\u0027s so,\" said Shorty, after judicially scanning the sentence. \"Jeb kin do some awful fancy kurlys, and draw a bird without takin\u0027 his pen from the paper, but he never writ my name a thousandth part as purty as Maria kin.\") \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And how purty you spel. Ime something ov a speler myself, \\n\\n and can nock out most ov the boys in the company on \\n\\n Webster\u0027s Primary, but I aint to be menshuned in the saim \\n\\n day with you. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"With best respecks to your family, and hoapin soon to here \\n\\n from you, I am very respeckfully, your friend, \\n\\n \\n\\n W. L. Elliot. \\n\\n \\n\\n Corpril, Company Q, 2 Hundsrdth Injiamiy Volintear \\n\\n Infantry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n By the time he had his letter finished, and was wiping the sweat of intense labor from his brow, he heard the bugle sounding the first call for dress parade. \"I must go and begin my fatherly dooties to little Pete Skidmore,\" he said, carefully sealing his letter and sticking a stamp on it, to mail at the Chaplain\u0027s tent as he went by. \"It\u0027s goin\u0027 to be extry fatigue to be daddy to a little cuss as lively as a schoolhouse flea, and Corpril of Co. Q, at the same time, but I\u0027m going to do it, if it breaks a leg.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He was passing a clump of barberry bushes when he overheard Pete Skidmore\u0027s voice inside: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll bet $10 I kin pick it out every time. I\u0027ll bet $25 I kin pick it out this time. Don\u0027t tech the cards.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to lose no more money on baby bets,\" replied a tantalizing voice. \"I\u0027ll make it $40 or nothin\u0027. Now, youngster, if y\u0027re a man—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty softly parted the bushes and looked in. Two of the well-known sharpers who hung around the camps had enticed little Pete in there, and to a game of three-card monte. They had inflamed his boyish conceit by allowing him to pick out two cards in succession, and with small bets. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hain\u0027t got but $40 left o\u0027 my bounty and first month\u0027s pay,\" said little Pete irresolutely, \"and I wanted to send $35 of it home to mother, but I\u0027ll—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll do nothin\u0027 o\u0027 the kind,\" shouted Shorty, bursting through the bushes. \"You measly whelps, hain\u0027t you a grain o\u0027 manhood left? Ain\u0027t you ashamed to swindle a green little kid out o\u0027 the money that he wants to send to his widowed mother?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go off and \u0027tend to your own business, if you know what\u0027s good for you,\" said the larger of the men threateningly. \"Keep your spoon out o\u0027 other folks\u0027 soup. This young man knows what he\u0027s about. He kin take care o\u0027 himself. He ain\u0027t no chicken. You ain\u0027t his guardeen.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No he ain\u0027t,\" said Pete Skidmore, whose vanity was touched as well as his cupidity aroused. \"Mind your own business, Mister Elliott. You\u0027re only a Corpril anyway. You hain\u0027t nothin\u0027 to do with me outside the company. I kin take care o\u0027 myself. I\u0027ve beat these men twice, and kin do it again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Clear out, now, if you don\u0027t want to git hurt,\" said the larger man,\u0027 moving his hand toward his hip. \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty\u0027s response was to kick over the board on which the cards were lying, and knock the man sprawling with a back-handed blow. He made a long pass at the other man, who avoided it, and ran away. Shorty took Pete by the collar and drew him out of the bushes, in spite of that youngster\u0027s kicks and protestations. \\n\\n \\n\\n He halted there, pulled out his pocket-knife, and judicially selected a hickory limb, which he cut and carefully pruned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027re you goin\u0027 to do?\" asked Pete apprehensively. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to give you a lesson on the evils of gamblin\u0027, Pete, especially when you don\u0027t know how.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I did know how,\" persisted Pete. \"I beat them fellers twice, and could beat them every time. I could see quicker\u0027n they could move their hands.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You little fool, you knowed about as much about them cards as they know of ice-water in the place where Jeff Davis is goin\u0027. Pete, I\u0027m goin\u0027 to be a second father to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dod dum you, who asked you to be a daddy to me? I\u0027ve had one already. When I want another, I\u0027ll pick one out to suit myself,\" and Pete looked around for a stone or a club with which to defend himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pete,\" said Shorty solemnly as he finished trimming the switch, and replaced the knife in his pocket, \"nobody\u0027s allowed to pick out his own daddy in this world. He just gits him. It\u0027s one o\u0027 the mysterious ways o\u0027 Providence. You\u0027ve got me through one o\u0027 them mysterious ways o\u0027 Providence, and you can\u0027t git shet o\u0027 me. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to lick you still harder for swearin\u0027 before your father, and sayin\u0027 disrespeckful words to him. And I\u0027m goin\u0027 to lick you till you promise never to tech another card until I learn you you how to play, which\u0027ll be never. Come here, my son.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The yells that soon rose from that thicket would have indicated that either a boy was being skinned alive or was having his face washed by his mother. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63304.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
