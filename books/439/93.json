{"id":45128,"no":93,"title":"CHAPTER VI. THE BOYS IN THE OLD HOME ON BEAN BLOSSOM CREEK.","content":"THE Deacon had been afraid to telegraph directly to his wife that he was bringing the boys home. He knew the deadly alarm that would seize mother and daughters at the very sight of the yellow telegraph envelope directed to them. They would interpret it to mean that Si was dead, and probably in their grief fail to open the envelope and read the message. So at Jeffersonville he sent a message to Sol Pringle, the agent and operator at the station. The Deacon remembered the strain the former message had been on the young operator\u0027s intelligence, besides he himself was not used to writing messages, and so, regardless of expense, he conveyed his thoughts to Sol in this wise: Deer Sol: put yore thinkin\u0027 cap on, and understand just what Ime sayin\u0027. I want you to send word out to the house at once that Ime comin\u0027 home this evenin\u0027 on the accommodation train, and bringing the boys. Be keerful and doant make a fool of yourself and skeer the wimmin fokes. Respectfully yores, Josiah Klegg. Sol had plenty of time to study that dispatch out, and he not only sent word as desired, but he communicated the news to all who came to the station. The result was there was quite a crowd of friends there to greet the home-comers. The reception of the message had thrown the household into a flurry of joyful expectancy. It was far better news than the Deacon\u0027s last letter had led them to anticipate. After a few moments of tearful ejaculation and mutual kissing over it, mother and daughters began to get everything in readiness to give the returning ones the warmest, most cheerful welcome. Abraham Lincoln was summoned in from his rail-splitting, which he had been pursuing quite leisurely during the Deacon\u0027s absence, and stirred to spasmodic energy under Maria\u0027s driving to cut an additional supply of dry wood, and carry it into every room in the house, where little Sammy Woggles, the orphan whom the Deacon and Mrs. Klegg were bringing up, built cheer-shedding fires. Mrs. Klegg had her choicest young chickens killed, and after she and Amanda had robbed every other room of whatever they thought would add to the comfort of Si\u0027s, she set herself to work preparing a supper which would outdo all her previous efforts. Hours before the train was due Maria had Abraham Lincoln bring out the spring-wagon and hitch the horses to it. Then he had to lay in a bed of clean straw, and upon this was placed a soft feather bed, blankets and pillows. Maria decided that she would drive to the station herself. \"Never do in the world,\" said she, \"to trust them skittish young horses, what hain\u0027t done a lick o\u0027 work since Pap went away, to that stoopid darky. They\u0027d surely run away and break his neck, which \u0027d be no great loss, and save lots o\u0027 provisions, but they\u0027d smash that new wagon and break their own necks, which are worth more\u0027n $200 apiece.\" \"Maria, how can you talk so?\" said the gentle Mrs. Klegg reprovingly. \"It\u0027s a sin to speak so lightly o\u0027 death o\u0027 a feller-creature.\" \"Well, if he\u0027s a feller-creature o\u0027 mine,\" returned the sprightly Maria, \"the Lord made a slack-twisted job of him some dark night out o\u0027 remnants, and couldn\u0027t find no gumption to put in him. He gave him an alligator\u0027s appetite instid. And ain\u0027t I tryin\u0027 to save his life? Besides, I\u0027m nearly dead to see Si. I want to be the first to see him.\" This aroused Amanda, but Maria stood on her rights as the elder sister, had her way, as she usually did, and drove away triumphantly fully two hours before train-time. Upon her arrival at the station she quickly recognized that she was the central figure in the gathering crowd, and she would have been more than a young woman if she had not made the most of her prominence. Other girls were there with their fathers and mothers who had brothers who had been in the three months\u0027 service, or were now in three years regiments, or who had been discharged on account of disability, or who had been in this battle or that, but none of them a brother who had distinguished himself in the terrible battle about which everybody was now talking, who had helped capture a rebel flag, who had been wounded almost to death, who had been reported dead, and who was now coming home, a still living evidence of all this. No boy who had gone from Bean Blossom Creek neighborhood had made the figure in the public eye that Si had, and Maria was not the girl to hide the light of his achievements under a bushel. She was genially fraternal with those girls who had brothers still in the service, affable to those whose brothers had been in, but were now, for any reason, out, but only distantly civil to those whose brothers had not enlisted. Of these last was Arabella Widgeon, whose father had been one of the earliest immigrants to the Wabash, and was somewhat inclined to boast of his Old Virginia family. He owned a larger farm than the Deacon\u0027s, and Arabella, who was a large, showy girl, a year or two older than Maria, had been her schoolmate, and, Maria thought, disposed to \"put on airs\" over her. Arabella\u0027s brother Randolph was older than Si, but had chosen to continue his studies at Indianapolis rather than engage in \"a war to free the niggers.\" But Arabella had developed an interest in the war since she had met some engaging young gentlemen who had come through the neighborhood on recruiting duty, and was keeping up a fitful correspondence with two or three of them. \"It must be very nice, Maria,\" said Arabella, with a show of cordiality, but which Maria interpreted as an attempt to patronize, \"to have your brother back home with you again.\" \"It certainly will be. Miss Widgeon,\" answered Maria, with strictly \"company manners.\" \"One who has never had a brother exposed to the constant dangers of army life can hardly understand how glad we all feel to have Si snatched from the very jaws of death and brung back to us.\" \"That\u0027s a little love-tap that\u0027ll settle several scores with Miss Frills,\" Maria chuckled to herself. \"Partickerly the airs she put on over all us girls when she was running around to singing-school and church with that Second Lieutenant, who ain\u0027t got across the Ohio River yet, and I don\u0027t believe he intends to. Sol Pringle tells me all his letters to her are postmarked Jeffersonville.\" Arabella took no seeming notice of the shot, but came back sweetly: \"I am awfully glad that your brother was not hurt so badly as at first reported. He couldn\u0027t be, and be able to come home now. These papers do magnify everything so, and make no end of fuss over little things as well as big ones, I was very much alarmed at first, for fear Si might be really badly hurt.\" This was too much for Maria. Her company manners slid off like a drop of water from a cabbage leaf, and she answered hotly: \"I\u0027d have you know. Miss Widgeon, the papers don\u0027t magnify the matter. They don\u0027t make a fuss over nothing. They don\u0027t begin to tell all the truth. None o\u0027 them can. My brother was nearer dead than any man who ever lived. Nothing but the favor of God and Klegg grit pulled him through. It\u0027d killed a whole house full o\u0027 Randy Widgeons or that Second Lieutenant. I remember Randy Widgeon turning pale and a\u0027most fainting when he run a fish-hook in his finger. If it ain\u0027t nothing, why don\u0027t Randy Widgeon go down there a little while, with the rest o\u0027 the boys, and do his share?\" \"My brother disbelieves in the constitutionality of this war, and denies that we have any right to take away other people\u0027s slaves,\" said Arabella loftily. \"I s\u0027pose he\u0027s a right to his opinions.\" \"A poor excuse\u0027s better\u0027n none,\" retorted Maria. \"I noticed that he didn\u0027t turn out last Summer to keep John Morgan from stealing our people\u0027s horses, and robbing their stores and houses. S\u0027pose he thought it unconstitutional to let a nasty rebel gorilla shoot at him. It\u0027s very convenient to have opinions to keep you from doin\u0027 things that you\u0027re afraid to do.\" The dialog was approaching the volcanic stage, when a poorly-dressed, sad-faced woman, with a babe in her arms, edged through the crowd to Maria, and said timidly, for she had never been accounted by the Kleggs as in their set: \"Miss Maria, I don\u0027t s\u0027pose you know me, but I do so want to git a chance to speak to your pap as soon as he gets here, and before all these people gits hold of him. Mebbe he\u0027s found out something about poor Jim. I can\u0027t believe that Jim was killed, and I keep hopin\u0027 that he got away somehow, and is in one o\u0027 them hospitals. Mebbe your pap knows. I know you think Jim was bad and rough, but he was mighty good to me, and he\u0027s all that I had. I\u0027m nearly dead to hear about him, but I can\u0027t write, nor kin Jim. I\u0027ve bin tryin\u0027 to make up my mind to come over to your house, and ax you to write for me.\" \"Of course, you can, you poor, dear woman,\" said Maria, her mood changing at once from fierceness to loving pity. \"You shall be the first one to speak to Pap and Si after me. Why didn\u0027t you come over to see us long ago. We\u0027d only bin too glad to see you, and do all we could for you. Yes, I know you. \"You\u0027re Polly Blagdon, and live down by the sawmill, where your husband used to work. You look tired and weak carrying that big baby. Let me hold him awhile and rest you. Sit down there on that box. I\u0027ll make Sol Pringle clear it off for you.\" \u0027arabella Curled Her Lip at Seeing Maria Take the Baby.\u0027 87 Arabella curled her nose, at seeing Maria take the unwashed baby in her arms, to the imminent danger of her best gown, but Maria did not notice this, and was all loving attention to the baby and its mother. It seemed an age until the whistle of the locomotive was heard. The engine had to stop to take water at the creek, several hundred yards from the station, and Maria\u0027s impatience to see Si and be the first to speak to him could not brook the delay. \"Come along, Mrs. Blagdon,\" she called, and with the baby still in her arms, she sped down the cinder track to the pumping station, and then along the line of freight cars until she recognized her father\u0027s face looking from the caboose, which was still beyond the bridge. She shouted joyously at him. \"Maria\u0027s out there, waitin\u0027 for us, and she\u0027s got a baby in her arms. What do you suppose she thinks we want a baby for?\" \"\u0027Spect she\u0027s been practicin\u0027 on it, so\u0027s to take care o\u0027 us, Si,\" said Shorty. \"I believe we\u0027ve been more trouble to your father than we wuz to our mothers when we wuz teethin\u0027.\" \"I\u0027ve bin repaid for all, more\u0027n repaid for all,\" said the Deacon; \"especially since I\u0027m once more back home, and out o\u0027 the reach o\u0027 the Sheriffs o\u0027 Tennessee. I\u0027ll stay away from Chattanoogy till after the Grand Jury meets down there. If it does its dooty there\u0027ll be several bills with Josiah Klegg\u0027s name entirely too conspicuous.\" \"I want to be able to git out to the next covenant meetin\u0027, Pap,\" said Si with a grin, \"and hear you confess to the brethren and sisters all that you\u0027ve bin up to down at Chattanoogy.\" \"Well, you won\u0027t git there,\" said the Deacon decisively. \"We don\u0027t allow nobody in there who hain\u0027t arrived at the years o\u0027 discreetion, which\u0027ll keep you out for a long time yit.\" The train pulled over across the bridge, and handing the baby to its mother, Maria sprang in, to recoil in astonishment at the sight of Annabel\u0027s blushing face. \"You mean thing,\" said Maria, \"to steal a march on me this way, when I wanted to be the first to see Si. Where in the world did you come from, and how did you find out he was comin\u0027 home on this train? Si, you didn\u0027t let her know before you did us, did you?\" She was rent by the first spasm of womanly jealousy that any other woman should come between her brother and his mother and sisters. \"Don\u0027t be cross, Maria,\" pleaded Annabel. \"I didn\u0027t know nothin\u0027 of it. You know I\u0027ve been down to see the Robinses, and intended to stay till tomorrer, but something moved me to come home today, and I just happened to take this train. I really didn\u0027t know. Yet,\" and the instinctive rights of her womanhood and her future relations with Si asserted themselves to her own wonderment, \"I had what the preachers call an inward promptin\u0027, which I felt it my dooty to obey, and I now think it came from God. You know I ought to be with Si as soon as anybody,\" and she hid her face in her hands in maidenly confusion. \"Of course you ought, you dear thing,\" said Maria, her own womanhood overcoming her momentary pique. \"It was hateful o\u0027 me to speak that way to you.\" And she kissed Annabel effusively, though a little deadness still weighed at her heart over being supplanted, even by the girl she liked best in all the world after her own sister. If the young folks had not been so engaged in their own affairs they would have seen the Deacon furtively undoing his leathern pocket-book and slipping a greenback into the weeping Mrs. Blagdon\u0027s hand, as the only consolation he was able to give her. There were plenty of strong, willing hands to help carry Si from the caboose to the wagon. It was strange how tender and gentle those strong, rough farmers could be in handling a boy who had been stricken down in defense of his country. Annabel\u0027s face was as red as a hollyhock over the way that everybody assumed her right to be next to Si, and those who could not get a chance at helping him helped her to a seat in the wagon alongside of him, while the dethroned Maria took her place by her father, as he gathered the reins in his sure hands and started home. Maria had to expend some of the attentions she meant for Si upon Shorty, who received them with awkward confusion. \"Now, don\u0027t make no great shakes out o\u0027 me, Miss Maria,\" he pleaded. \"I didn\u0027t do nothin\u0027 partickler, I tell you. I was only along o\u0027 Si when he snatched that rebel flag, and I got a little crack on the head, which wouldn\u0027t \u0027ve amounted to nothin\u0027, if I hadn\u0027t ketched the fever at Chattanoogy. I\u0027m a\u0027most well, and only come back home to please the Surgeon, who was tired seein\u0027 me around.\" They found the house a blaze of light, shining kindly from the moment it came in sight, and there was a welcome in Towser\u0027s bark which touched Si\u0027s heart. \"Even the dogs bark differently up here. Shorty,\" he said. \"It\u0027s full and honest, and don\u0027t mean no harm. You know that old Towser ain\u0027t barkin\u0027 to signal some bushwhackers that the Yankees \u0027s comin\u0027. It sounds like real music.\" It was Mrs. Klegg\u0027s turn to receive a shock when she rushed out to greet her son, and found Annabel by his side. It went deeper to her heart than it had to Maria\u0027s; but, then, she had more philosophy, and had foreseen it longer. After everything had been done, after she had fed them her carefully-prepared dishes, after the boys had been put to bed in the warmed room, and she knew they were sleeping the sound sleep of deep fatigue, she went to her own room to sit down and think it all over. There Maria found her, wiping away her tears, and took her in her arms, and kissed her. \"It\u0027s right. It\u0027s all right. It\u0027s God\u0027s ways,\" said the mother. \"A son\u0027s a son till he gets a wife; But a daughter\u0027s a daughter all her life.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63280.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
