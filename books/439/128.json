{"id":45163,"no":128,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. SI AND SHORTY ARE PUT UNDER ARREST.","content":"THE next morning the rebels were found to be gone from the position in front of the 200th Ind;, and after breakfast the regiment marched leisurely by a road around the dreaded abatis, to the ground which had been scarred and mangled by our terrible artillery fire. It was an appalling scene that the eyes of the boys rested upon. Every horrid form of mutilation and death which could be inflicted by the jagged shards and fiendish shells, or the even more demon-like shrapnel-balls, was visible. Everything was torn, rent, and ragged, as if soma mighty giant, insane to destroy, had spent his fury there. Nothing had escaped the iron flail of devastation. Trees shattered or cut entirely down; limberchests and cannon-wheels merely bunches of blackened splinters; frightfully mangled horses, dead, or yet living in agony that filled their great plaintive eyes; lying in ghastly pools of blood, which filmed and clotted under the bright rays of the May morning sun. \"Looks like Judgment morn or the fall of Babylon,\" muttered the religious-minded Alf Russell, the first to break their awed silence. Awful Destruction. 242 \"Or the destruction of Sennacherib,\" suggested Monty Scruggsâ€” \"For the angel of death spread his wings on the blast, And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed.\" \"I should say he had a mighty strong breath, Monty,\" Shorty interrupted. He liked to break in on Monty\u0027s heroics. \"Excuse me from havin\u0027 a 12pounder breathin\u0027 around me.\" \"And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill, And their hearts but once heaved, and forever grew still,\" continued Monty. \"I\u0027ll bet there wasn\u0027t much sleepin\u0027 around here while that shell\u0027n\u0027 was goin\u0027 on,\" broke in Shorty again. \"Except the sleep that has the sod for a coverlet and Gabriel\u0027s trumpet for a breakfast bell.\" Monty continued impressively: \"And there lay the steed, with his nostrils all wide, But through them there rolled not the breath of his pride; And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf, And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.\" \"Poor horses,\" murmured Shorty. \"I always feel mighty sorry for them. They hadn\u0027t nothin\u0027 to do with gittin\u0027 up this rebellion. We must go around and kill such as is alive, and put them out o\u0027 their misery.\" Monty resumed: \"And there lay the rider, distorted and pale. With the dew on his brow and the rust on his mail; And the tents were all silent, the banners alone. The lances uplifted, the trumpets unblown.\" \"Serves \u0027em right, the yaller-bellied, clay-eatin\u0027 yowlers,\" said Shorty savagely, looking over the mangled corpses. \"Pays \u0027em up for their murderin\u0027 abatis. We got it in this time worse on them than they did on us, though it\u0027d take as much of this as\u0027d make up several Counties to pay up for any one o\u0027 the good boys we lost yesterday. I hope they are all where they kin look down and see how we got it on the secesh hell-hounds. We\u0027ll do \u0027em up worse yit before we\u0027re through with \u0027em.\" \"Our batteries are improvin\u0027 wonderfully,\" commented the more practical Si, studying the field. \"They seem to\u0027ve socked every shell in just where it\u0027d do the most good. No shootin\u0027 at the State o\u0027 Georgy generally and trustin\u0027 to luck to hit a rebel. Every shell seems to\u0027ve landed just where it was needed, and then \u0027tended to its business and busted. You don\u0027t see no signs of any strikin\u0027 a quarter of a mile away, nor a whole one layin\u0027 around anywhere. That\u0027s good gunnin\u0027, and I\u0027m glad our old six-hoss thrashin\u0027-machine done the biggest share of it. Our brigade has the best battery in the whole army.\" \"The regiment will go on,\" reported Orderly-Sergeant, \"but Co. Q will stay behind to bury the dead, gather up the arms and things, and then bring up the brigade ammunition train.\" \"Stay behind to bury the dead,\" grumbled Shorty. \"Nice business that! Sextons to the Southern Confederacy. Hain\u0027t they got any niggers around here that they kin set at the work?\" Nor did Si like the job. \"The artillery made the muss, and now the infantry\u0027s got to stay and clean up after it. That don\u0027t seem right.\" \"Well, orders is orders, and got to be obeyed,\" said the Orderly-Sergeant, cutting short the discussion with the usual formulary of his class. An Orderly-Sergeant is robbed of one of the cherished privileges of the other enlisted men. He can not criticise or grumble, but must stop the others from doing so beyond a certain point, and his refuge must be the prompt assumption that the orders are all right, and must be executed cheerfully. And he has not the satisfaction of the officers above him in knowing the why and wherefore of the orders, and perhaps advising as to them. He is \"betwixt and between,\" as they say out West. \"The quicker we get at it,\" continued the Orderly, \"the sooner it\u0027ll be over. Serg\u0027t Klegg, take eight or 10 men and hunt around for some picks and shovels. I think that deep trench over there behind the works \u0027ll do for a grave. You can shovel the bank right down on them and save hard work. Serg\u0027t Wilson, you take eight or 10 men and gather up these pieces o\u0027 men and lay them in there. Corp\u0027l Jones, you take another man or two and go around and kill those horses. Be careful how you shoot now. Don\u0027t hurt anybody with glancing bullets. Corp\u0027l Elliott, you take the rest and go round and gather the guns and other things, and pile them up there by that tree to turn over to the ordnance officer. Hustle, now, all of you.\" \"They didn\u0027t think they were digging their own graves,\" philosophized Monty Scruggs, as he stood shovel in hand watching the remains being gathered into the trench. \"He digged a ditch, he digged it deep; He digged it for his brother, But for his great sin he fell in The ditch he\u0027d digged for t\u0027other.\" \"Good, good, Monty,\" said Si. \"That\u0027s the best thing I\u0027ve heard you spout yit. Give us some more of it.\" \"There isn\u0027t any more of it. The only thing I can think of is: \"The rebel Solomon Grundy; Born in Georgia on Monday; Become a rebel on Tuesday; Run off from Buzzard\u0027s Roost on Wednesday; Got licked at Dalton on Thursday; Worse whipped at Resaca on Friday; Blown up by a shell on Saturday; Died and buried on Sunday; And this was the end of Solomon Grundy.\" Alf Russell\u0027s interest in anatomy had led him to join Serg\u0027t Wilson\u0027s party in gathering up the ghastly fragments of bodies, but the sights were too much for his nerves, and as he perceived that he was growing sick at the stomach he went over to Shorty\u0027s squad. It was astonishing what things they found, besides guns and equipments. Evidently, the rebels had left quite hurriedly, and many personal belongings were either forgotten or could not be found in the darkness. Samples of about everything that soldiers carry, and a good many that they are not supposed to, were found lying around. There were cooking utensils, some on the fire, with corn-pone and meat in them; some where the imperative orders to march found their owners with their breakfasts half-devoured; there were hats clumsily fashioned of wisps of long-leaved pine sewed together; there were caps which had been jaunty red-and-blue \"Zouaves\" when their owners had mustered around Nashville in 1861, but had been faded and tarnished and frayed by the mud and rain at Donelson, Shiloh and Stone River, and by the dust and grime of Perryville and Chickamauga, until they had as little semblance to their former perkiness as the grim-visaged war had to the picnic of capturing ungarrisoned forts and lolling in pleasant Summer camps on the banks of the Cumberland. There were coats of many patterns and stages of dilapidation, telling the same story of former finery, draggled through the injurious grime of a thousand camps and marches. There were patched and threadbare blankets, tramped-out boots and shoes, an occasional book, many decks of cards, and so on. Shorty came across a new cedar canteen with bright brass hoops. He slung it over his shoulder, with the thought that it would be a nice thing to send back to Maria, as a souvenir of the battle. She might hang it up in her room, or make a pin-cushion or a work-basket out of it. Presently he came to a box of shells, which he picked up and carried back to the tree. It was quite heavy, and when he set it down again he felt thirsty. The canteen occurred to him. It was full. He raised it to his lips and took a long swig. \"Great Jehosephat,\" he gasped, his eyes starting out with astonishment. \"That ain\u0027t water. It\u0027s prime old applejack, smoother\u0027n butter, and smellin\u0027 sweeter\u0027n a rose. Best I ever tasted.\" Shorty had been strictly abstinent since his return from Indiana, The rigid views of the Klegg family as to liquor-drinking had sunk into his heart, and somehow whenever temptation came his way the clear, far-seeing eyes of Maria would intervene with such a reproachful glance that the thought of yielding became repugnant. But the smooth, creamy applejack had slipped past his lips so unexpectedly that it possessed him, before principle could raise an objection. Shorty was the kind of a man to whom the first drink is the greatest danger. After he had one almost anything was likely to happen. Still, though his blood was already warming with the exhilarating thrill, there were some twinges of conscience. \"Now, I mustn\u0027t take no more o\u0027 that,\" he said to himself. \"That one drink was good and all right enough, because I really thought I was goin\u0027 to take a drink of water when I put the canteen to my lips. I could swear that to Maria on a stack o\u0027 Bibles high as her dear head. God bless her!\" He began bustling about with more activity, and giving his orders in a louder voice. He saw Pete Skidmore pick up what had been once a militia officer\u0027s gaudy coat, and examine it curiously. He shouted at him: \"Here, drop that, drop that, you little brat. What \u0027d I tell you? That you mustn\u0027t fetch a rag of anything you see in here, except with the point o\u0027 your bayonet and with your bayonet on your gun. drop it, I tell you.\" \"Why, what\u0027s the matter with that old coat?\" asked Pete in an injured tone, astonished at Shorty\u0027s vehemence. \"Everything\u0027s the matter with it, and every stitch o\u0027 cloth you find. They\u0027re swarmin\u0027 with rebel bugs. I\u0027ve trouble enough to keep the Yankee graybacks off you. If you git the rebel kind on you angwintum won\u0027t save you.\" Pete dropped the coat in affright. \"And you, Sandy Baker,\" continued Shorty in a yell, \"don\u0027t you walk through them piles o\u0027 brush and leaves, where the rebels has bin sleepin\u0027. You\u0027ll git covered with rebel bugs, too, and we\u0027ll never git \u0027em out o\u0027 the company. How often \u0027ve I got to tell you that?\" Yelling so much made him dry, and the canteen hung so invitingly near his hand. \"I don\u0027t think another pull at that old applejack \u0027ll hurt me a mite. I really didn\u0027t git a square drink the first time, because I was choked off by astonishment at findin\u0027 it wasn\u0027t water. I\u0027ll just take enough of a swig to finish up that drink.\" \"Jerusalem crickets,\" he exclaimed, wiping his mouth, \"but that\u0027s good stuff. Wonder if bein\u0027 in cedar makes it taste so bang-up? If I though so I\u0027d never drink out o\u0027 anything but cedar as long\u0027s I lived. Guess I\u0027ll keep this canteen to carry water in. I kin send Mariaâ€”\" He stopped. He was not so far gone as to forget that any thought of Maria was very inappropriate to his present condition. He started to blustering at the boys who were carrying in guns: \"Here, how often have I got to caution you galoots about bein\u0027 careful with them guns? Don\u0027t let the muzzles pint at yourselves, nor anybody else. They\u0027re all likely to be loaded, and go off any minute, and blow some o\u0027 your cussed heads offen you. Don\u0027t slam \u0027em down that way. Be careful with \u0027em, I tell you. I\u0027ll come over there and larrup some o\u0027 you, if you don\u0027t mind me.\" \"What\u0027s excitin\u0027 Shorty so, to make him yell that way? wondered Si, stopping in his shoveling down the embankment upon the rebel dead, and wiping his hot face. \"O, he\u0027s trying to keep them fresh young kids from blowin\u0027 themselves into Kingdom Come with the rebel guns,\" answered one of the veterans indifferently, and they resumed their shoveling. Shorty started over to where some of the boys were trying to extricate a rebel limber abandoned in a ravine. He spied a pair of fine field glasses lying on the ground, and picked them up with an exclamation of delight. \"Great Jehosephat,\" he said, turning them over for careful inspection. \"Ain\u0027t this a puddin\u0027? Just the thing to give the Cap. He got his smashed with a bullet comin\u0027 through the abatis, and\u0027s bin mournin\u0027 about \u0027em ever since. These is better\u0027n his was, and he\u0027ll be ticked to death to git \u0027em.\" He put them to his eyes and scanned the landscape. \"Ain\u0027t they just daisies, though. Bring that teamster over there so close that I kin hear him cussin\u0027 his mules. Cap\u0027ll have a better pair o\u0027 glasses than the Colonel or the General has. He deserves \u0027em, too. Capt. McGillicuddy\u0027s good all the way through, from skin to bone, and as brave as they make \u0027em. He\u0027ll be tickleder than a boy with a new pair o\u0027 red-topped boots. He\u0027ll invite me to take a drink with him, but he won\u0027t have nothin\u0027 so good as this old apple-jack. I guess I\u0027ll give the rest to him, too, for his friends at headquarters. They don\u0027t often smack their lips over stuff like that. But I\u0027ll treat myself once more, just as Capt. McGillicuddy\u0027d do.\" The last drink was a settler. He was then in a frame of mind for anythingâ€”to tear down a mountain, or lift a hill, or to fight anybody, with or without cause. He looked over at the boys struggling with the limber, and yelled, as he laid his coat, hat, canteen, and cartridge-box down on the stump upon which he had been sitting, and placed the field-glass upon them: \"Hoopee! Yank her out o\u0027 there, boys. Yank h\u0027er out, and don\u0027t be all day about it, either. Let me git at her and I\u0027ll fetch her out. Stand by, you kids, and see your uncle Eph snatch her.\" He bolted in to the ravine, swung the limber-tongue about, and with aid of the rest, stirred to united effort by much profane vociferation on his part, disengaged the limber and trundled it up the bank. The tall, very stiff young Aid, with whom Si and Shorty had had the previous affair, came stalking on to the ground, viewing everything with his usual cold, superior, critical gaze. \"You are doing well, my man,\" he remarked to Shorty, \"but too much noise. A non-commissioned officer must not swear at his men. It\u0027s strictly against regulations.\" \"Go to blazes,\" said Shorty, scarcely under his breath. The Aid picked up the field-glasses, looked at them a minute, scanned the field with them, and then looked around for the case, as if to appropriate them himself. \"Here, drop them,\" said Shorty roughly. \"Them\u0027s mine.\" \"How did they come to be yours, sir?\" said the Aid sternly. \"Picked them up, didn\u0027t you?\" \"None o\u0027 your business how I got \u0027em. They\u0027re mine, I tell you. Give \u0027em to me.\" \"You picked them up on the battlefield, sir. They are military equipments which you must turn over to the proper officer. I\u0027ll take charge of them myself.\" \"You\u0027ll do nothin\u0027 o\u0027 the kind,\" roared Shorty, striding up to him. \"Give me them glasses.\" \"I shall do nothing of the kind,\" said the Aid sternly. \"Don\u0027t you dare approach me in that w-ay. Go back to your duties at once. I shall punish you for disrespect to me and threatening an officer. Fall back, sir, I tell you.\" Shorty made a grab for the glasses, which the Aid tried to evade, but Shorty fixed his firm clutch upon them. The Aid held on tightly, but Shorty wrenched them from his grasp. \"You bob-tailed brevet West Pointer,\" said Shorty savagely, raising his fist, \"I\u0027ve a notion to break you in two for tryin\u0027 to beat me out o\u0027 what\u0027s mine. Git out o\u0027 here, or I\u0027llâ€”\" \"Shorty! Shorty! Stop that!\" shouted Si, rushing over to his partner, and catching his back-drawn fist. He had been suspicious as to the cause of his partner\u0027s noisiness, and ran up as soon as the disturbance began. \"Stop it, I say. Are you crazy?\" Poor little Pete, badly excited as to what was happening to his best friend, was nervously fumbling his gun and eyeing the Aid. \"Si Klegg, go off and mind your own business, and let me attend to mine,\" yelled Shorty, struggling to free himself from his partner\u0027s iron grasp. \"Am I goin\u0027 to be run over by every pin-feather snipe from West Point? I\u0027ll break him in two.\" \"Sergeant,\" commanded the Aid, reaching to take the field-glasses from Shorty\u0027s hand; \"buck and gag that man at once. Knock him down if he resists. Knock him down, I say.\" \"You tend to your own business and I\u0027ll tend to mine. Go away from here, and don\u0027t say anything to make him madder, you wasp-waisted errand boy,\" said Si savagely, as he thrust himself in between the Aid and Shorty. \"I\u0027ve got enough to do to take care of him. Go off, if you don\u0027t want him to mash you.\" Little Pete had an idea. He wriggled in between, snatched the glasses, and made off with them. The Brigade Provost-Marshal rode up and sternly demanded what the disturbance was about. Shorty began a hot harrangue against young staff officers generally, and this particular offender, but Si got his arm across his mouth and muffled his speech. The Provost listened to the Aid\u0027s bitter indictment against both Si and Shorty. \"Put both those men under arrest,\" he said to the Orderly-Sergeant, \"and make a list of the witnesses. I\u0027ll court-martial them at the first halting place.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63315.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
