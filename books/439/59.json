{"id":45094,"no":59,"title":"CHAPTER XII. THE BAN ON WET GOODS","content":"SI HAS A HARD TIME TRYING TO KEEP WHISKY OUT OF CAMP. \"DETAIL for guard to-morrow,\" sang out the Orderly-Sergeant, after he had finished the evening roll-call: \"Bailey, Belcher, Doolittle, Elliott, Fracker, Gleason, Hendricks, Hummerson. Long, Mansur, Nolan, Thompson.\" \"Corp\u0027l Klegg, you will act as Sergeant of the Guard. \"Dan Elliott will act as Corporal of the Guard.\" It is one of the peculiarities of men that the less they have to do the less they want to do. The boys of Co. Q were no different from the rest. When they were in active service a more lively, energetic crowd could not be found in the army. They would march from daybreak till midnight, and build roads, dig ditches, and chop trees on the way. They were ready and willing for any service, and none were louder than they in their condemnation when they thought that the officers did not order done what should be. But when lying around camp, with absolutely nothing to do but ordinary routine, they developed into the laziest mortals that breathed. To do a turn of guard duty was a heart-breaking affliction, and the Orderly-Sergeant\u0027s announcement of those who were detailed for the morrow brought forth a yell of protest from every man whose name was called.165 \"I only come off guard day before yesterday,\" shouted Bailey. \"I\u0027m sick, and can\u0027t walk a step,\" complained Belcher, who had walked 15 miles the day before, hunting \"pies-an\u0027-milk.\" \"That blamed Orderly\u0027s got a spite at me; he\u0027d keep me on guard every day in the week,\" grumbled Doolittle. \"I was on fatigue dooty only yesterday,\" protested Fracker, who had to help carry the company rations from the Commissary\u0027s tent. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to the Surgeon an\u0027 git an excuse,\" said Gleason, who had sprained his wrist a trifle in turning a handspring. So it went through the whole list. \"I want to see every gun spick-and-span, every blouse brushed and buttoned, and every shoe neatly blacked, when I march you up to the Adjutant,\" said the Orderly, entirely oblivious to the howls. \"If any of you don\u0027t, he\u0027ll have a spell of digging up roots on the parade. I won\u0027t have such a gang of scarecrows as I have had to march out the last few days. You fellows make a note of that, and govern yourselves accordingly.\" \"Right face—Break ranks—March!\" \"Corp\u0027l Klegg,\" said the Officer of the Day the next morning, as Si was preparing to relieve the old guard, \"the Colonel is very much worked up over the amount of whisky that finds its way into camp. Now that we are out here by ourselves we certainly ought to be able to control this. Yet there was a disgusting number of drunken men in camp yesterday, and a lot of trouble that should not be. The Colonel has166 talked very strongly on this subject, and he expects us to-day to put a stop to this. I want you to make an extra effort to keep whisky out. I think you can do it if you try real hard.\" \"I\u0027ll do my best, sir,\" said Si, saluting. \"Shorty,\" Si communed with his next in rank before they started on their rounds with the first relief, \"we must see that there\u0027s no whisky brung into camp this day.\" \"You jest bet your sweet life there won\u0027t be, either,\" returned Shorty. He felt not a little elated over his brevet rank and the responsibilities of his position as Corporal of the Guard. \"This here camp\u0027ll be as dry as the State o\u0027 Maine to-day.\" It was a hot, dull day, with little to occupy the time of those off guard. As usual, Satan was finding \"some mischief for idle hands to do.\" After he put on the first relief, Si went back to the guard tent and busied himself awhile over the details of work to be found there. There were men under sentence of hard labor that he had to find employment for, digging roots, cleaning up the camp, chopping wood and making trenches. He got the usual chin-music from those whom he set to enforced toil, about the injustice of their sentences and \"the airs that some folks put on when they wear a couple of stripes,\" but he took this composedly, and after awhile went the rounds to look over his guard-line, taking Shorty with him. Everything seemed straight and soldierly, and they sat down by a cool spring in a little shady hollow. \"Did you ever notice, Shorty,\" said Si, speculatively, as he looked over the tin cup of cool water he167 was sipping, \"how long and straight and string-like the cat-brier grows down here in this country? You see 25 or 30 feet of it at times no thicker\u0027n wooltwine. Now, there\u0027s a piece layin\u0027 right over there, on t\u0027other side o\u0027 the branch, more\u0027n a rod long, and no thicker\u0027n a rye straw.\" \"I see it, an\u0027 I never saw a piece o\u0027 cat-brier move endwise before,\" said Shorty, fixing his eyes on the string-like green. \"As sure\u0027s you\u0027re alive, it is movin\u0027,\" said Si, starting to rise. \"Set still, keep quiet an\u0027 watch,\" admonished Shorty. \"You\u0027ll find out more.\" Si sat still and looked. The direction the brier was moving was toward the guard-line, some 100 feet away to the left. About the same distance to the right was a thicket of alders, where Si thought he heard voices. There were indications in the weeds that the cat-brier extended to there. The brier maintained its outward motion. Presently a clump of rags was seen carried along by it. \"They\u0027re sending out their money for whisky,\" whispered Shorty. \"Keep quiet, and we\u0027ll confiscate the stuff when it comes in.\" They saw the rag move straight toward the guardline, and pass under the log on which the sentry walked when he paced his beat across the branch. It finally disappeared in a bunch of willows. Presently a bigger rag came out from the willows, in response to the backward movement of the long cat-brier, and crawled slowly back under the log and into camp. As it came opposite Si jumped out, put his foot on the cat-brier and lifted up the rag. He168 found, as he had expected, that it wrapped up a pint flask of whisky. \"O, come off, Si; come off, Shorty!\" appealed some of Co. Q from the alders. \"drop that. You ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to be mean, boy\u0027s. You don\u0027t need to know nothin\u0027 about that, an\u0027 why go makin\u0027 yourselves fresh when there\u0027s no necessity? We want that awful bad, and we\u0027ve paid good money for it.\" \"No, sir,\" said Shorty sternly, as he twisted the bottle off, and smashed it on the stones. \"No whisky goes into this camp. I\u0027m astonished at you. Whisky\u0027s a cuss. It\u0027s the bane of the army. It\u0027s the worm that never dies. Its feet lead down to hell. Who hath vain babblings? Who hath redness of eyes? The feller that drinks likker, and especially Tennessee rotgut.\" \"O, come off; stop that dinged preaching, Shorty,\" said one impatiently. \"There\u0027s nobody in this camp that likes whisky better\u0027n you do; there\u0027s nobody that\u0027ll go further to get it, an\u0027 there\u0027s nobody up to more tricks to beat the guard.\" \"What I do as a private soldier, Mr. Blakesley,\" said Shorty with dignity, \"haint nothing to do with my conduct when I\u0027m charged with responsible dooty. It\u0027s my dooty to stop the awful practice o\u0027 likker-drinkin\u0027 in this camp, an\u0027 I\u0027m goin\u0027 to do it, no matter what the cost. You jest shet up that clam-shell o\u0027 your\u0027n an\u0027 stop interfering with your officers.\" Si and Shorty went outside the lines to the clump of willows, but they were not quick enough to catch Groundhog, the teamster, and the civilian whom our readers will remember as having his head shaved in the camp at Murfreesboro some weeks before. They169 found, however, a jug of new and particularly rasping apple-jack. There was just an instant of wavering in Shorty\u0027s firmness when he uncorked the jug and smelled its contents. He lifted it to his lips, to further confirm its character, and Si trembled, for he saw the longing in his partner\u0027s eyes. The latter\u0027s hand shook a little as the first few drops touched his tongue, but with the look of a hero he turned and smashed the jug on a stone. \"You\u0027re solid. Shorty,\" said Si. \"Yes, but it was an awful wrench. Le\u0027s git away from the smell o\u0027 the stuff,\" answered Shorty. \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027ll be too much for me yit.\" \"Corporal of the Guard, Post No. 1.\" \"Sergeant of the Guard, Post No. 1,\" came down the line of sentries as the two boys were sauntering back to camp. \"Somethin\u0027s happening over there at the gate,\" said Si, and they quickened their steps in the direction of the main entrance to the camp. They found there a lank, long-haired, ragged Tennesseean, with a tattered hat of white wool on his head. His scanty whiskers were weather-beaten, he had lost most of his front teeth, and as he talked he spattered everything around with tobacco-juice. He rode on a blind, raw-bone horse, which, with a dejected, broken-down mule, was attached by ropes, fragments of straps, withes, and pawpaw bark to a shackly wagon. In the latter were some strings of dried apples, a pile of crescents of dried pumpkins, a sack of meal, a few hands of tobacco, and a jug of buttermilk. \"I want t\u0027 go inter the camps an\u0027 sell a leetle jag170 o\u0027 truck,\" the native explained, as he drenched the surrounding weeds with tobacco-juice. \"My ole woman\u0027s powerful sick an\u0027 ailin\u0027, an\u0027 I need some money awfully t\u0027 git her some quinine. Yarbs don\u0027t seem t\u0027 do her no sort o\u0027 good. She must have some Yankee quinine, and she\u0027s nigh dead fer some Yankee coffee. This war\u0027s mouty hard on po\u0027 people. Hit\u0027s jest killin\u0027 \u0027em by inches, by takin\u0027 away their coffee an\u0027 quinine. I\u0027m a union man, an\u0027 allers have bin.\" \"You haint got any whisky in that wagon, have you?\" asked Si. \"O, Lord, no! nary mite. You don\u0027t think I\u0027d try t\u0027 take whisky into camp, do you? I\u0027m not sich a bad man as that. Besides, whar\u0027d I git whisky? The war\u0027s broke up all the \u0027stilleries in the country. What the Confedrits didn\u0027t burn yo\u0027uns did. I\u0027ve bin sufferin\u0027 for months fur a dram o\u0027 whisky, an\u0027 as fur my ole woman, she\u0027s nearly died. That\u0027s the reason the yarbs don\u0027t do her no good. She can\u0027t get no whisky to soak \u0027em in.\" \"He\u0027s entirely too talkative about the wickedness o\u0027 bringin\u0027 whisky into camp,\" whispered Shorty. \"He\u0027s bin there before. He\u0027s an old hand at the business.\" \"Sure you\u0027ve got no whisky?\" said Si. \"Sartin, gentlemen; sarch my wagon, if you don\u0027t take my word. I only wish I knowed whar thar wuz some whisky. I\u0027d walk 20 miles in the rain t\u0027 git one little flask fur my ole woman and myself. I tell you, thar haint a drap t\u0027 be found in the hull Duck River Valley. \u0027Stilleries all burnt, I tell you.\" And in the earnestness of his protestations he sprayed his team,171 himself, and the neighboring weeds with liquid tobacco. Si stepped back and carefully searched the wagon, opening the meal sack, uncorking the buttermilk jug, and turning over the dried apples, pumpkins and tobacco. There certainly was no whisky there. Shorty stood leaning on his musket and looking at the man. He was pretty sure that the fellow had had previous experience in running whisky into camp, and was up to the tricks of the trade. Instead of a saddle the man had under him an old calico quilt, whose original gaudy colors were sadly dimmed by the sun, rain, and dirt. Shorty stepped forward and lifted one corner. His suspicions were right. It had an under pocket, in which was a flat, half-pint flask with a cob stopper, and filled with apple-jack so new that it was as colorless as water. \"I wuz jest bringin\u0027 that \u0027ere in fur you, Capting,\" said the Tennesseean, with a profound wink and an unabashed countenance. \"Stick hit in your pocket, quick. None o\u0027 the rest \u0027s seed you.\" Shorty flung the bottle down and ordered the man off his horse. The quilt was examined. It contained a half-dozen more flasks, each holding a \"half-pint of throat-scorch and at least two fights,\" as Shorty expressed it. A clumsy leather contrivance lay on the hames of the mule. Flasks were found underneath this, and the man himself was searched. More flasks were pulled out from the tail pockets of his ragged coat; from his breast; from the crown of his ragged hat. \"Well,\" said Shorty, as he got through, \"you\u0027re a regler grogshop on wheels. All you need is a lot172 o\u0027 loafers talkin\u0027 politics, a few picturs o\u0027 racin\u0027 hosses and some customers buried in the village graveyard to be a first-class bar-room. Turn around and git back to that ole woman o\u0027 your\u0027n, or we\u0027ll make you sicker\u0027n she is.\" Si and Shorty marched around with the second relief, and then sat down to talk over the events of the morning. \"I guess we\u0027ve purty well settled the whisky business for to-day, at least,\" said Si. \"The Colonel can\u0027t complain of us. I don\u0027t think we\u0027ll have any more trouble. Seems to me that there can\u0027t be no more whisky in this part o\u0027 Tennessee, from the quantity we\u0027ve destroyed.\" \"Don\u0027t be too dinged sure o\u0027 that,\" said Shorty. \"Whisky seems to brew as naturally in this country as the rosin to run out o\u0027 the pine trees. I never saw sich a country fur likker. They have more stills in Tennessee than blacksmith shops, and they work stiddier.\" Si looked down the road and saw returning a wagon which had been sent out in the morning for forage. It was well loaded, and the guards who were marching behind had a few chickens and other supplies that they had gathered up. \"Boys seem to be purty fresh, after their tramp,\" said he, with the first thought of a soldier looking at marching men. \"They\u0027ve all got their guns at carry arms. I noticed that as they came over the hill.\" \"Yes,\" answered Shorty, after a glance, \"and they\u0027re holdin\u0027 \u0027em up very stiff an\u0027 straight. That gives mo an idee. Lo\u0027s go over there an\u0027 take a look at \u0027em.\"173 Shorty had sniffed at a trick that he had more than once played in getting the forbidden beverage past the lynx-eyed sentry. \"Don\u0027t you find it hard work to march at routstep with your guns at a carry?\" he said insinuatingly. \"No need o\u0027 doin\u0027 that except on parade or drill. Right-shoulder-shift or arms-at-will is the thing when you\u0027re on the road.\" \"H-s-sh,\" said the leading file, with a profound wink and a sidelong glance at Si. \"Keep quiet, Shorty,\" he added in a stage whisper. \"We\u0027ll give you some. It\u0027s all right. We\u0027ll whack up fair.\" \"No, it ain\u0027t all right,\" said Shorty, with properly offended official dignity. \"Don\u0027t you dare offer to bribe me, Buck Harper, when I\u0027m on duty. Hand me that gun this minute.\" Harper shamefacedly handed over the musket, still holding it carefully upright. Shorty at once reversed it and a stream of whisky ran out upon the thirsty soil. Si grasped the situation, and disarmed the others with like result. \"I ought to put every one o\u0027 you in\u0027 the guardhouse for this. It\u0027s lucky that the Officer of the Guard wasn\u0027t here. He\u0027d have done it. There he comes now. Skip out after the wagon, quick, before he gits on to you.\" \"What next?\" sighed Si. \"Is the whole world bent on bringin\u0027 whisky into this camp? Haint they got none for the others?\" \"Sergeant of the Guard, Post No. 1,\" rang out upon the hot air. Si walked over again to the entrance, and saw seeking admission a tall, bony174 woman, wearing a dirty and limp sunbonnet and smoking a corn-cob pipe. She was mounted on a slab-sided horse, with ribs like a washboard, and carried a basket on her arm covered with a coarse cloth none too clean. \"Looks as if she\u0027d bin picked before she was ripe and got awfully warped in the dryin\u0027. All the same she\u0027s loaded with whisky,\" commented Shorty as the woman descended from her saddle and approached the sentry with an air of resolute demand. \"You haint got no right to stop me, young feller,\" she said. \"I come in hyar every day an\u0027 bring pies. Your Jinerul said I could, an\u0027 he wanted me to. His men want my pies, an\u0027 they do \u0027em good. Hit\u0027s homecookin\u0027, an\u0027 takes the taste o\u0027 the nasty camp vittles out o\u0027 their mouths, an\u0027 makes \u0027em healthy. You jest raise yer gun, an\u0027 let me go right in, or I\u0027ll tell yer Jinerul, an\u0027 he\u0027ll make it warm fur yer. I\u0027ve got a pass from him.\" \"Let me see your pass,\" said Si, stepping forward. The woman unhooked her linsey dress, fumbled around in the recesses, and finally produced a soiled and crumpled paper, which, when straightened out, read: \"Mrs. Sarah Bolster has permission to pass in and out of the camp of the 200th Indiana Volunteer Infantry. \"By order of Col. Quackenbush. \"D. L. Blakemore, Lieut. \u0026 Adj\u0027t.\" \"What\u0027ve you got in that basket?\" asked Si, still hesitating. \"Pies,\" she answered confidently. \"The best pies you ever seed. Some of \u0027em pumpkin; but the rest175 of \u0027em dried apple, with lots o\u0027 \u0027lasses in fur sweetenin\u0027. Your mother never baked better pies \u0027n \u0027em.\" \"To my mind,\" muttered Shorty, as he stepped forward to investigate the basket, \"she\u0027s the kind o\u0027 a woman I\u0027d like to have bake pies for a gang o\u0027 State\u0027s prison birds that I wanted to kill off without the trouble o\u0027 hangin\u0027. Say, ma\u0027am, are your pies pegged or sewed? What\u0027d you use for shortenen\u0027—injy rubber or Aunt Jemimy\u0027s plaster?\" he continued as he turned back the cloth and surveyed the well-known specimens of mountain baking which were as harmful to Uncle Sam\u0027s boys as the bullets of their enemies. \"Young feller, none o\u0027 yer sass,\" she said severely. \"Them\u0027s better pies than ye\u0027re used ter. Folks that\u0027s never had nothin\u0027 air allers the most partickeler, an\u0027 turnin\u0027 up thar noses at rayly good things. Don\u0027t fool with me no more, but let me go on inter camp, fur the soljers air expectin\u0027 me.\" \"Sure you haint got no whisky down in the bottom o\u0027 that basket?\" said Si, pushing the pies about a little, to get a better look. The indignation of the woman at this insinuation was stunning. She took her pipe out of her mouth to better express her contempt for men who would insult a Southern lady by such a hint—one, too, that had been of so much benefit to the soldiers by toiling over the hot oven to prepare for them food more acceptable than the coarse rations their stingy Government furnished them. She had never been so insulted in her life, and she would bring down on them dire punishment from the Colonel. Several experiences with the tongue-lashings of176 Southern viragoes had made Si and Shorty less impressed by them than they had been earlier in their service. Still, they had the healthy young man\u0027s awe of anything that wore skirts, and the tirade produced its effect, but not strong enough to eradicate the belief that she was a whisky-bringer. While she stormed Si kept his eyes fixed upon the scant linsey dress which draped her tall form. Presently he said to Shorty: \"What do you think? Shall we let her go in?\" Shorty whispered back with great deliberation: \"Si, what I know about the female form don\u0027t amount to shucks. Least of all the Tennessee female form. But I\u0027ve been lookin\u0027 that \u0027ere woman over carefully while she\u0027s been jawin\u0027, an\u0027 while she\u0027s naturally covered with knots and knobs in places where it seems to me that women generally don\u0027t have \u0027em, I can\u0027t help believin\u0027 that she\u0027s got some knots and knobs that naturally don\u0027t belong to her. In other words, she\u0027s got a whole lot o\u0027 flasks of whisky under her skirts.\" \"Jest what I\u0027ve been suspicionin\u0027,\" said Si. \"I\u0027ve heard that that\u0027s the way lots o\u0027 whisky is brung into camp. Shorty, as Corporal o\u0027 the Guard, it\u0027s your duty to search her.\" \"What!\" yelled Shorty, horror-struck at the immodest thought. \"Si Klegg, are you gone plum crazy?\" \"Shorty,\" said Si firmly, \"it\u0027s got to be done. She\u0027s got a pass, and the right to go into camp. We\u0027re both o\u0027 the opinion that she\u0027s carryin\u0027 in whisky. If she was a man there\u0027d be no doubt that she\u0027d have to be searched. I don\u0027t understand that the law177 knows any difference in persons. No matter what you may think about it, it is your duty, as Corporal o\u0027 the Guard, to make the search.\" \"No, sir-ree,\" insisted Shorty. \"You\u0027re Sergeant o\u0027 the Guard, and it\u0027s your dooty to make all searches.\" \"Shorty,\" expostulated Si, \"I\u0027m much younger and modester\u0027n you are, an\u0027 haint seen nearly so much o\u0027 the world. You ought to do this. Besides, you\u0027re under my orders, as Actin\u0027 Corporal. I order you to make the search.\" \"Si Klegg,\" said Shorty firmly, \"I\u0027ll see you and all the Corporals and Sergeants betwixt here and Washington in the middle o\u0027 next week before I\u0027ll do it. You may buck-and-gag me, and tie me up by the thumbs, and then I won\u0027t. I resign my position as Corporal right here, and\u0027ll take by gun and go on post.\" \"What in the world are we goin\u0027 to do?\" said Si desperately. \"If we let her in, she\u0027ll fill the camp full o\u0027 whisky, and she\u0027ll have to go in, unless we kin show some reason for keepin\u0027 her out. Hold on; I\u0027ve got an idee.\" He went up to the woman and said: \"You say you want to go into camp to sell your pies?\" \"Yes, sir, an\u0027 I want to go in right off—no more foolin\u0027 around,\" she answered tartly. \"How many pies\u0027ve you got?\" She went through a laborious counting, and finally announced: \"Eight altogether.\" \"How much are they worth?\" \"Fifty cents apiece.\"178 \"Very good,\" announced Si taking some money from his pocket. \"That comes to $4. I\u0027ll take the lot and treat the boys. Here\u0027s your money. Now you\u0027ve got no more business in camp, jest turn around and mosey for home. You\u0027ve made a good day\u0027s business, and ought to be satisfied.\" The woman scowled with disappointment. But she wisely concluded that she h\u0027d better be content with the compromise, remounted her horse and disappeared down the road. \"That was a sneak out of a difficulty,\" Si confessed to Shorty; \"but you were as big a coward as I was.\" \"No, I wasn\u0027t,\" insisted Shorty, still watchful. \"You\u0027d no right to order me do something that you was afraid to do yourself. That\u0027s no kind o\u0027 officering.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63246.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
