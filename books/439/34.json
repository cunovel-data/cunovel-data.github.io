THE VICTORIOUS ARMY","content":"SI AND SHORTY FINALLY SUCCEED IN GETTING OUT OF THE WET. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE BOYS were so glad to see Si back again alive that they robbed themselves of any choice morsel of food they might have saved for to-morrow\u0027s delectation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here, Si,\" said one, \"is a nice knuckle-bone o\u0027 ham, that I pulled back there at the General\u0027s when his cook returned to the tent for something. You ought t\u0027ve heard the nigger cussing as I walked away, but he couldn\u0027t recognize the back o\u0027 my head, nor see under my overcoat. Me and my chum \u0027ve had supper off it, and we wuz saving the rest for breakfast, but I\u0027ll brile it for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Some of them Kentucky fellers,\" said another, \"found a sheep in the briars and killed it. I traded \u0027em my silk handkerchief for a hunk o\u0027 the meat. I\u0027m going to cook a slice for you, Si.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Si, I\u0027ll bile some coffee for you,\" said a third. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll toast some crackers for you,\" added a fourth. \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty roused. He felt so much gladder than any of them, that he was jealous of their attentions. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"See here, you fellers,\" said he, \"this is my partner, an\u0027 I\u0027m able to take care of him. I\u0027ll bile all the coffee an\u0027 toast all the crackers he kin eat; though I\u0027m much obliged to you, Jim, for your ham, and to you, Billy, for your mutton, though I\u0027m afraid it\u0027ll taste too much of the wool for a wounded man.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t mind about that,\" said Si; \"I\u0027m hungry enough to eat the wool on the sheep\u0027s back, even. Hand over your mutton, Billy, and thankee for it. My appetite\u0027s not delicate, I can tell you. Woolly mutton won\u0027t faze it more\u0027n bark would a buzz-saw.\" Si didn\u0027t over-state the case. He ate everything119 that was cooked and offered him, until he declared that he was so full he \"could touch it with his finger.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty Thinks si Does Not Look Like a Ghost. 118 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027re not a ghost, from the way you eat,\" said Shorty, who was beginning to recover his propensity for sarcasm. \"If ghosts et like you there\u0027d have to be a steam bakery an\u0027 a pork packery run in connection with every graveyard.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I\u0027d never take no ghost to board,\" said Billy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come, Si,\" said Jimmy Barlow, filling his briarwood pipe with kinnikinnick, lighting it from the fire, taking a few puffs to start it, and handing it to Si, \"tell us just what happened to you. We\u0027re dyin\u0027 to hear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Si, settling down with the pipe into a comfortable position, \"I don\u0027t know what happened. Last thing I knowed I wuz runnin\u0027 ahead on Shorty\u0027s left, loadin\u0027 my gun, an\u0027 tryin\u0027 to keep up with the Colonel\u0027s hoss. Next thing I knowed I wuz wakin\u0027 up at the foot of a black-oak. Everything was quiet around me, except the yellin\u0027 of two or three wounded men a little ways off. At first I thought a cannonball\u0027 d knocked my whole head off. Then it occurred to me that if my head was knocked off I couldn\u0027t hear nor see.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nor think, even,\" injected Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, nor think, even. For what\u0027d you think with?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know some fellers that seem to think with their feet, and that blamed awkwardly,\" mused Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I kept on wakin\u0027 up,\" continued Si. \"At first I thought I had no head at all, an\u0027 then it seemed to me I was all head, it hurt so awfully. I couldn\u0027t move hand nor foot. Then I thought mebbe only half my head was shot away, an\u0027 the rest was aching for all.120 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I tried shuttin\u0027 one eye an\u0027 then the other, an\u0027 found I\u0027d at least both eyes left. I moved my head a little, an\u0027 found that the back part was still there, for a bump on the roots of the oak hurt it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By-and-by the numbness began to go out of my head an\u0027 arm, but I was afraid to put my hand up to my head, for I was afraid to find out how much was gone. Nearly the whole of the left side must be gone, an\u0027 all my schoolin\u0027 scattered over the ground. I lay there thinkin\u0027 it all over how awful I\u0027d look when you fellers came to find me and bury me, an\u0027 how you wouldn\u0027t dare tell the folks at home about it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Finally, I got plum desperate. I didn\u0027t seem to be dyin\u0027, but to be gettin\u0027 better every minute. I determined to find out just however much of my head was really gone. I put up my hand, timid-like, an\u0027 felt my forehead. It was all there. I passed my hand back over my hair an\u0027 the whole back of my head was there. I felt around carefully, an\u0027 there was the whole side of my head, only a little wet where I\u0027d got a spent ball. Then I got mad an\u0027 I jumped up. Think of my makin\u0027 all that fuss over a little peck that might have been made by a brick-bat. I started out to hunt you fellers, an\u0027 here I am.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, but you wouldn\u0027t \u0027ve bin here,\" philosophized Shorty, examining the wound, \"if the feller that fired that shot\u0027d given his gun a little hunch. If that bullet\u0027d went a half-inch deeper, you\u0027d be up among the stars a bow-legged Wabash angel.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, we\u0027ve licked the stuffin\u0027 out of \u0027em at last, haven\u0027t we?\" asked Si. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I should say we had,\" replied Shorty with an impressive whistle. \"I thought the artillery would121 tear the foundations out of the whole State of Tennessee, the way it let into them. There won\u0027t ba more crashin\u0027 an\u0027 bangin\u0027 when the world breaks up. I\u0027d a-bin willin\u0027 to serve 100 years just to see that sight. Lord, what a chance the cannoneers had. First time I ever wanted to be in the artillery. The way they slung whole blacksmith shops over into them woods, an\u0027 smashed down trees, and wiped out whole brigades at a clip, filled my soul with joy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We must go over there in the mornin\u0027 an\u0027 take a look at the place,\" said Si drowsily. \"It will be good to remember alongside o\u0027 the way they slapped it to us the first day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si and Shorty woke up the next morning to find the chill rain pouring down as if the country had been suffering from a year\u0027s drouth, and the rain was going to make up for it in one forenoon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lord have mercy,\" said the disgusted Shorty, as he fell into line for roll-call. \"Another seepin\u0027, soppin\u0027, sloshin\u0027, spatterin\u0027 day. Only had 14 of \u0027em this week so far. Should think the geese \u0027d carry umbrellas, an\u0027 the cows wear overshoes in this, land of eternal drizzle. If I ever get home they\u0027ll have to run me through a brick-kiln to dry me out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In spite of the down-pour the army was forming up rapidly to resume the advance upon Murfreesboro\u0027, and over the ground on the left, that had proved so disastrous to the rebels the day before. \\n\\n \\n\\n While the 200th Ind. was getting ready to fall in, the sick-call sounded, and the Orderly-Sergeant remarked to Si: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fall into this squad, Corporal Klegg.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What for?\" asked Si, looking askance at the squad.122 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To go to the Surgeon\u0027s tent,\" answered the Orderly-Sergeant. \"This is the sick squad.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I thought,\" answered Si; \"an\u0027 that\u0027s the reason I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to join it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But your head\u0027s bigger\u0027n a bushel, Si,\" remonstrated the Sergeant. \"Better let the doctor see it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want none of his bluemass or quinine,\" persisted Si. \"That\u0027s all he ever gives for anything. The swellin\u0027 \u0027ll come out o\u0027 my head in time, same as it does out o\u0027 other people\u0027s.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Corporal, I\u0027ll excuse you from duty to-day,\" said the Captain kindly. \"I really think you ought to go to the Surgeon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you don\u0027t mind, Captain,\" said Si, saluting, \"I\u0027ll stay with the boys. I want to see this thing to the end. My head won\u0027t hurt me half so bad as if I was back gruntin\u0027 \u0027round in the hospital.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Probably you are right,\" said the Captain. \"Come along, then.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Willing and brave as the men were, the movements were tiresomely slow and laggard. The week of marching and lying unsheltered in the rain, of terrific fighting, and of awful anxiety had brought about mental and physical exhaustion. The men were utterly worn out in body and mind. This is usually the case in every great battle. Both sides struggle with all their mental and physical powers, until both are worn out. The one that can make just a little more effort than the other wins the victory. This was emphatically so in the battle of Stone River. The rebels had exhausted themselves, even, more in their assaults than the union men had in repelling them. \\n\\n \\n\\n When, therefore, the long line of blue labored123 slowly through the mud and the drenching rain up the gentle slopes on the farther side of Stone River, the rebels sullenly gave ground before them. At last a point was reached which commanded a view of Murfreesboro\u0027 and the rebel position. The rebels were seen to be in retreat, and the exhausted Army of the Cumberland was mighty glad to have them go. \\n\\n \\n\\n As soon as it was certain that the enemy was really abandoning the bitterly-contested field, an inexpressible weariness overwhelmed everybody. The 200th Ind. could scarcely drag one foot after another as it moved back to find a suitable camping-ground. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si and Shorty crawled into a cedar thicket, broke down some brush for a bed, laid a pole in two crotches, leaned some brush against it to make a par tial shelter, built a fire, and sat down. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I declare, I never knew what being tuckered out was before,\" said Si. \"And it\u0027s come to me all of a sudden. This morning I felt as if I could do great things, but the minute I found that them rebels was really going, my legs begun to sink under me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Same way with me,\" accorded Shorty. \"Don\u0027t believe I\u0027ve got strength enough left to pull a settin\u0027 hen offen her nest. But we can\u0027t be drowned out this way. We must fix up some better shelter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The Colonel says there\u0027s a wagon-load o\u0027 rations on the way here,\" said Si, sinking wearily down on the ground by the fire, and putting out his hands over the feeble blaze. \"Let\u0027s wait till we git something to eat. Mebbe we\u0027ll feel more like work after we\u0027ve eaten something.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Si Klegg,\" said Shorty sternly, but settling down himself on the other side of the fire, \"I never knowed124 you to flop down before. You\u0027ve always bin, if any thing, forwarder than me. I was in hopes now that you\u0027d take me by the back o\u0027 the neck and try to shake some o\u0027 this laziness out o\u0027 me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wait till the rations come,\" repeated Si listlessly. \"Mebbe we\u0027ll fell livelier then. The shelter we\u0027ve fixed up\u0027ll keep out the coarsest o\u0027 the rain, anyway. Most o\u0027 the boys ain\u0027t got none.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When the rations arrived, Si and Shorty had energy enough to draw, cook and devour an immense supper. Then they felt more tired than ever. Shorty had managed to tear off a big piece of the wagon cover while he was showing much zeal in getting the rations distributed quickly. He got the company\u0027s share in this, and helped carry it to the company, but never for a minute relaxed his hold on the coveted canvas. Then he took it back to his fire. Si and he spent what energy they had left in making a tolerable tent of it, by stretching it over their shelter. They tied it down carefully, to keep anybody else from stealing it off them, and Shorty took the additional precaution of fastening a strip of it around his neck. Then they crawled in, and before night come on they were sleeping apparently as soundly as the Seven of Ephesus. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63221.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
