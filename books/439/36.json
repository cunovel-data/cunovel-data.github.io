{"id":45071,"no":36,"title":"CHAPTER XII. ADDING TO THEIR COMFORT","content":"MAKING ADDITIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR \"HOME.\" SI AND Shorty kept Sunday as planned. They really did not know how tired they were until they formed the resolution to give the day to absolute restfulness. Then every joint and muscle ached from the arduous toil of the past week, added to the strains and hardships of a week of battle. \"Used to seem to me,\" said Shorty, \"that when Sunday come after the first week\u0027s plowin\u0027 in Spring that I had a bile in every limb. Now I appear to have one in every j\u0027int, and in my brains as well. I didn\u0027t ever suppose that I could be so tired, and yit be able to set up and take nourishment.\" \"Same here,\" said Si. \"Feel as if I ought to be wrapped in cotton battin\u0027 an\u0027 sweet oil, an\u0027 laid away for awhile.\" The only thing about them which did not show deadly lassitude was their appetites. Fortunately, the Commissary took a liberal view of the Regulations as to rations, issuing enough to make up for those they had not drawn during the times when his department was not in working order. They ate all these and wanted more. \u0027am I a Soldier of the Cross?\u0027 139 The Quartermaster had also succeeded in re-establishing relations. They drew from him new139 under-clothing to replace that which they had lost, took a thorough wash the first good one they had had since Christmas morning, beat and brushed much of the accumulated mud representing every variety of140 soil between Murfreesboro\u0027 and Nashville out of their clothes, cleaned and greased their heavy brogans, and went with their comrades to divine service, feeling that they had made every provision required for a proper observance of the holy day. Si had a really fine baritone voice, and led the meeting in singing \"Am I a soldier of the cross?\" After church Shorty said: \"Si, when you were singing so loud about being a soldier of the cross and a follower of the Lamb I wanted to git right up and tell you that you\u0027d have to git a transfer from the 200th Ind. We\u0027ve lots of cross soldiers, especially on mud marches, but we don\u0027t want any soldiers in this regiment except for the Constitution of the United States and the laws made in pursuance thereof, against all enemies and opposers whatsoever, either foreign or domestic. An\u0027 as for follerin\u0027 the lamb, you know as well as I do the orders agin foragin\u0027.\" \"O, dry up, Shorty. I don\u0027t believe going to church done you a mite o\u0027 good. I tell you it done me lots.\" \"There you\u0027re mistaken,\" answered Shorty. \"It just done me lots o\u0027 good. Kind o\u0027 restored communications with home and respectable folks once more, an\u0027 made me think I still belonged to what the jographies call civilized and partially-civilized people, something that we seem in great danger o\u0027 forgettin\u0027, the way we\u0027ve bin goin\u0027 on.\" The good Chaplain\u0027s fervent appeals to devote the141 day to earnest consideration of their soul\u0027s welfare could not keep them from spending the hours in planning and discussing further improvements on the house. \"We must have a real door,\" said Shorty, looking critically at the strip of canvas that did duty for that important adjunct. \"Muslin looks shiftless, an\u0027, besides, I think it\u0027s unhealthy. Lets in drafts, an\u0027 will give us colds.\" \"Too bad about our ketchin\u0027 cold,\" said Si sardonically. \"Most o\u0027 the time lately we\u0027ve bin sleepin\u0027 out with nothin\u0027 around us but the State line of Tennessee.\" \"Don\u0027t be too flip, young man,\" said Shorty severely. \"You have not had a home with its blessin\u0027s long enough to appreciate it. I say we must have a real door an\u0027 a winder that\u0027ll let in light, an\u0027 a bedstead, an\u0027 a floor o\u0027 planks.\" \"We ought to have \u0027em, certainly,\" agreed Si. \"But must have \u0027em is quite another thing. How are we goin\u0027 to git \u0027em? There\u0027s 40,000 men around here, snatchin\u0027 at every piece o\u0027 plank as big as your hand.\" \"Well,\" retorted Shorty, \"we\u0027re goin\u0027 to have a real door, a winder, and a plank floor, all the same. They\u0027re to be had somewhere in this country, an\u0027 they\u0027ll have to run mighty hard to git away from us.\" The next morning the Orderly-Sergeant said: \"Corp\u0027l Klegg, you\u0027ll take five men, go down to the railroad, and report to the Commissary to load the wagon with rations.\" Si took Shorty and four others and started off on142 this errand. He was soon so busy rolling heavy pork barrels from the car into the wagon that he failed to notice that Shorty was not with him. Finally they got the wagon loaded and started, with them walking alongside, puffing and sweating from their vigorous labor. They were not 100 yards away from the train, when the Conductor came storming up: \"See here, Lieutenant,\" he said to the Commissary, \"some o\u0027 them men o\u0027 yours sneaked around and stole the hind door off my caboose while you was loading up.\" \"I don\u0027t believe a word of it,\" said the Commissary, firing up at once. \"Mine ain\u0027t that kind of men. I\u0027d have you know they don\u0027t steal. What reason have you for saying so?\" \"The door was on the car when I came out to meet you, and now it\u0027s gone, and there\u0027s been no body near the caboose but your men.\" \"I know my men were working hard all the time right under my eyes,\" said the Lieutenant, growing angrier every minute. \"They\u0027re not the men to steal anything, and if they were they didn\u0027t have any chance. They were too busy. You can satisfy yourself that they didn\u0027t. You see none of them have the door with them, and you can search the wagon. Get right in there and look for it.\" The Conductor climbed into the wagon and looked carefully through. \"No, it\u0027s not there,\" he said ruefully. Then the Commissary\u0027s wrath flamed out. \"There, confound you, you are at it again, you infernal civilian, slandering and abusing men who are fighting143 for their country. Charging them with stealing your old caboose door. Think of your disgraceful impudence, villifying men who are shedding their blood for their country by such shameless charges.144 Shorty Confiscates the Caboose Door. 143 \"What\u0027d they want with your old car door? Get away from here, before I lose my temper and do you damage.\" The Conductor walked away muttering: \"Blasted thieving whelps o\u0027 soldiers, what\u0027ll they steal next? Lost all my train tools at Lavergne, swiped the bedding at Smyrna, got away with our clothes and dishes at Antioch, stole stove and lanterns at Overall\u0027s Crick, and now they\u0027ve begun on the cars. I\u0027ll be lucky to have enough wheels left on the engine to run her back to Nashville.\" The Commissary continued to fume about the disgraceful charges brought against his men until they reached camp. The wagon was unloaded and the squad dismissed. As Si came up to the \"house\" he saw Shorty busily engaged in hanging the caboose door by means of hinges which he had improvised from some boot tops. \"Why, Shorty,\" gasped Si, \"how did you git away with it?\" \"Easy enough,\" answered his partner. \"I saw you fellers gittin\u0027 very busy over them pork barrels, an\u0027 all the train hands helpin\u0027 you. I meandered back to the caboose, gently lifted the back door offen its hinges, slipped down into the weeds in the ditch, an\u0027 kept under cover o\u0027 them till I was out o\u0027 sight. Say, isn\u0027t it just a bully door?\" That afternoon Si and Shorty walked over to where a detail of men were at work building a bridge across Stone River, under the direction of a Lieutenant of Pioneers. They had an idea that an opportunity might occur there to pick up something that would add to their home comforts. The Lieutenant was bustling about, hurrying the completion of the work before night. As the detail was made up of squads from various regiments, he was not acquainted with the men, and had much difficulty assigning them to the work that would suit them best. He came up to Si, who still wore the artillery Sergeant\u0027s overcoat he had picked up during the battle, and said sharply: \"Here, Sergeant, don\u0027t stand around doing nothing. Set the men a good example by pitching in lively. There\u0027s plenty to do for everybody. If you can\u0027t find anything else, help dig down that bank, and roll those big stones into the fill. Hold on; I\u0027ve thought of something else. I want a reliable man to send over for some lumber. Put one of your men on that wagon there, and go with him, and take this letter to Capt. Billings, over at the saw-mill. It\u0027s a requisition for a load of lumber. Avoid the camps as much as possible on your way back, or they\u0027ll steal every inch of it away from you.\" \"Very good, sir,\" said Si, saluting. \"Shorty, jump on the wagon there, and gather up the lines.\" Shorty very obediently took his place on the seat of the two-horse wagon employed by the Pioneers for their jobs. \"Hurry up,\" enjoined the Lieutenant; \"we need those boards at once.\" \"Very good, sir,\" said Si, saluting. \"This is what I call a puddin\u0027,\" said Shorty, oracularly, as they drove away. \"The Lord always kin be trusted to help the deservin\u0027, if the deservin\u0027 only keep their eyes peeled for His p\u0027inters. This146 comes from not workin\u0027 yesterday and goin\u0027 to church.\" They drove down to the sawmill, delivered their requisition, and had their wagon loaded with newly-sawn plank. The Captain had the planks carefully counted, the number and feet entered upon the record, and set forth upon the return which he gave to Si to be delivered to the Lieutenant of Pioneers. \"Too dod-gasted much bookkeepin\u0027 in this army,\" remarked Si, rather disconsolately, and he put the paper in his blouse pocket, and they drove away. \"Wastes entirely too much valuable time. What\u0027d he count them boards for? Looked like he suspicioned us. How are we going to git away with any o\u0027 them?\" \"I wouldn\u0027t have that man\u0027s suspicious mind for anything,\" answered Shorty. \"He don\u0027t trust no body. All the same, we\u0027re goin\u0027 to have enough boards for our floor.\" \"How are we goin\u0027 to manage it?\" asked Si. \"Lots o\u0027 ways. There\u0027s no need o\u0027 your carryin\u0027 that paper back to the Lootenant. I might pick up several hundred feet and sneak away without your knowin\u0027 it. Say,\" as a bright idea struck him, \"what\u0027s the use o\u0027 goin\u0027 back to the Lootenant at all? Neither of us belongs to his detail. He don\u0027t know us from a side o\u0027 sole-leather. What\u0027s the matter with drivin\u0027 the wagon right up to camp, and swipin\u0027 the whole business, horses, wagon and all?\" \"I hain\u0027t been in the army as long as you have, Shorty,\" said Si doubtfully. \"I\u0027ve made some progress in petty larceny, as you know, but I ain\u0027t yit quite up to stealin\u0027 a span o\u0027 horses and a wagon.147 Mebbe I\u0027ll come to it in time, but I ain\u0027t quite ready for it now.\" \"That comes from goin\u0027 to church yesterday, and hearin\u0027 the Chaplain read the Ten Commandments,\" said Shorty wrathfully. \"I don\u0027t believe they ought to allow the Chaplains to read them things. They ain\u0027t suited to army life, and there ought to be a general order that they\u0027re prejudicial to good order and military discipline. Where\u0027d the army be if they obeyed that one about not covetin\u0027 a horse or other movable property? I tell you what we\u0027ll do, since you\u0027re so milky on the thing: We\u0027ll drive up in front of our house, unload enough boards for our floor, you git out your gun and bayonet and stand guard over \u0027em, and I\u0027ll drive the wagon down near the bridge, and jump off and leave it.\" \"All right,\" said Si; \"that\u0027ll do splendidly, if you think you kin dodge the Lootenant.\" \"O, he be darned,\" said Shorty scornfully. \"I could git away from him if I wasn\u0027t 10 years old.\" They carried out the plan. They drove up in front of their residence, and threw off a liberal quantity of the boards. The other boys raised a yell, and made a break for them. But Si ran inside, got his gun, and established himself on guard. \"Don\u0027t you budge an inch from there till I git back,\" shouted Shorty, as he drove away. \"Don\u0027t let one of Co. Q lay a finger on them. They\u0027re the durndest thieves outside the Jeffersonville Penitentiary. You can\u0027t trust one o\u0027 them farther than you could sling a bull by the tail. I\u0027ll be back soon.\" Shorty drove gaily down until he got close to the bridge. The Lieutenant had been impatiently148 expecting him, and as soon as the wagon came up it was surrounded by a crowd of men to unload it. The Lieutenant looked over the load. Si Defended the Plunder. 148 \"I wonder if he sent enough. Let me see your return,\" he said, looking up at the seat, where he expected to find the Sergeant he had put in charge. But the seat was empty. Shorty had jumped down, prudently mingled with the crowd, avoided the Lieutenant\u0027s eye with much more than his usual diffidence, and was modestly making his way back to camp behind a thicket of hazel bushes. When he got to the house he was delighted to find Si still master of the situation, with all the boards present and accounted for. They quickly transferred them to the interior, and found that they had enough for a nice floor, besides a couple of extra ones, to cut up into a table and stools. \"You done good work in keepin\u0027 the other boys offen \u0027em, Si,\" said he. \"I was afraid you wouldn\u0027t. The only thing I\u0027ve got agin Co. Q is that the boys will steal. Otherwise they\u0027re the nicest kind o\u0027 boys.\" A couple of days later they got a pass to go down to Murfreesboro\u0027 and look the sleepy old town over. They were particularly interested in the quaint old courthouse, which had once been the capitol of Tennessee. They happened into one of the offices, which was entirely deserted. On the wall hung a steel engraving of Jeff Davis in a large oak frame. \"That blamed old rebel picture oughtn\u0027t to be hangin\u0027 there, Si,\" observed Shorty. \"Indeed it oughtn\u0027t. Jeff ought to be hung to a sour-apple tree, and that glass\u0027d make a nice winder for our house.\" \"Indeed it would,\" Shorty started to answer, but time was too precious to waste in speech. In an instant he had shoved an old desk up to the wall, mounted it, and handed the picture down to Si. They wrapped it up in their overcoats, and started back for camp. They had seen enough of Murfreesboro\u0027 for that day.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63223.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
