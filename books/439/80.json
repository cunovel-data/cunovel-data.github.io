THE FRISKY YOUNGSTERS","content":"TRYING TO LICK A BATCH OF RECRUITS INTO SHAPE. \n \n FOR awhile the tumult of thought kept Si awake, but he was too young, healthy, and tired for this to last long, and soon he had his head pillowed on his blanket-roll, placed in the open car-window, and was sleeping too sound to even dream of Annabel, while the rushing train pelted his face with cinders from the engine and a hail of gravel from the road-bed. But what was that to a soldier-boy who had been home, seen his best girl, and had one of his mother\u0027s square meals? \n \n When the train rolled into Jeffersonville in the afternoon, they saw Lieut. Bowersox on the platform anxiously waiting for them. His face lighted up with pleasure when he saw them, and eagerly coming forward he said: \n \n \"Great Cesar, boys, but I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve come. I\u0027ve been waiting for you all day. Rush orders came last night to send everybody to the front. I guess they are in need of every gun they can get. I should have gone last night, but I managed to stave off my orders till now. If you hadn\u0027t come on this train, though, I should \u0027ve had to go on with out you. Hurry along, now. We are going right across the river.\" \n \n Despite the Lieutenant\u0027s urgency, Si found time to hand him a jar of honey and a small crock of butter from their home supplies, which he received with proper appreciation, and handed over to the grinning negro boy he had picked up somewhere in Tennessee for a servant. They followed the Lieutenant to where he had his squad of about 100 recruits gathered. He said: \n \n \"Here, Klegg, you will act as Orderly-Sergeant, and Shorty and the rest of you as Sergeants of this detachment. Here is the list of them, Klegg. Make up a roll and call it whenever I order you to do so.\" \n \n Si took the list and looked over the crowd. They were mainly boys of about the same age and style as himself when he first enlisted, but he thought he had never seen so green, gawky a lot in the world. Like him then, every one was weighted down with a bundle of things that would evidently be contributed to the well-being of the people along the line of march. \n \n It seemed to him that they stood around the platform in as ugly crookedness as a lodgment of driftwood on a Wabash bottom after a freshet. \n \n \"Where on the Wea prairies,\" muttered Shorty, \"did Old Abe pick up that job lot o\u0027 wind shaken, lopsided saplings? Must\u0027ve bin pulled when green and warped in the dryin\u0027.\" \n \n \"Well, we\u0027ve got to git \u0027em into some sort o\u0027 shape,\" answered Si. \"You must help.\" \n \n \"I help?\" returned Shorty despairingly. \"You\u0027ll need a West Point perfessor and a hay-press to git that crowd into soldier shape. I ain\u0027t once.\" \n \n \"Here, Sergeant,\" ordered Lieut. Bowersox, \"line the men up, count them, learn their names, and give them a little preliminary drill, while I go to Headquarters and see the Colonel again about our transportation.\" \n \n \"Fall in, boys; fall in,\" commanded Si. \n \n The crowd looked at him curiously. They knew that he wanted them to do something, they were willing to do it, but they hadn\u0027t the slightest idea what it was. They made a move by huddling up a little toward him. \n \n \"Fall in in two ranks, with the right here,\" shouted Si. \n \n There was more inconsequent huddling, which seemed so purposely awkward that it irritated Si, and he spoke sharply: \n \n \"Gosh all Krismuss, what\u0027s the matter with you lunkheads? Don\u0027t you know nothing? You\u0027re dummer\u0027n a lot o\u0027 steers.\" \n \n \"Guess we know \u0027bout as much as you did when you first enlisted,\" said the smallest of the lot, a red-cheeked, bright-eyed boy, who looked as if he should have been standing up before a blackboard \"doing a sum\" in long division, instead of on his way to the field of strife. \"Show us how, and we\u0027ll learn as quick as you did.\" \n \n Si looked at the fresh young boy. There was something actually girlish in his face, and it reminded him of Annabel. His heart softened toward him at once, and he remembered his own early troubles. He said gently to the boy: \n \n \"You\u0027re right. What\u0027s your name, my boy?\" \n \n \"Abel Waite.\" \n \n \"Well, Abel, we\u0027ll make a soldier out of you in a little while. You are the smallest; you\u0027ll be the left of the line. Go and stand there at the corner. Now, boys, all lay your bundles down. Here, you tall fellow, what\u0027s your name?\" \n \n \"James Bradshaw.\" \n \n \"Well, Bradshaw, you\u0027ll be the right of the line all the time, and the rest \u0027ll form on you. Come, stand here.\" \n \n Bradshaw shambled forward in a way that made Shorty call out: \n \n \"Here, Bradshaw, wake up! You ain\u0027t now follerin\u0027 a plow over the last year\u0027s corn-furrers. Straighten up, lift them mud-hooks livelier and drop your hands to your side.\" \n \n The man stopped, raised his hands, and looked at Shorty with his mouth wide open. \n \n \"Come, Bradshaw,\" said Si gently, taking hold of him, \"I\u0027ll show you. Now you stand right here. Put your heels together. Now turn your toes out. Throw your shoulders back this way. Close your mouth. Put your little fingers on the seams of your pantaloons that way. Now stand just so.\" \n \n The poor man looked as miserable as if put in a strait-jacket, but tried to literally obey instructions. \n \n \"Now, what\u0027s your name?\" Si asked the next tall est man. \n \n \"Simeon Wheelwright.\" \n \n \"Wheelwright, you stand behind Bradshaw, just as he does.\" \n \n And so Si went painstakingly through the whole squad until he came to Abel Waite, whom he found did not need any instruction, for he had profited by hearing the lectures to the others, and was standing as stiff and correct as a veteran could have done. \n \n \"Great outfit,\" remarked Shorty, walking down the line, gun in hand, and surveying it critically. \"Looks like a mourners\u0027 bench froze stiff. Here, you red-headed man there, take in that corporation. You won\u0027t have so much bay window after you\u0027ve lived on army rations awhile.\" \n \n \"Now,\" commanded Si, \"when I say \u0027Count twos from the right,\u0027 I want you to begin and count. The first man you, Bradshaw says \u0027one,\u0027 and the next man on your left says \u0027two\u0027 and so on. The men in the rear rank do the same. Count twos from the right Count!\" \n \n \"One, two; four, six; seven, nine; ten, \u0027leven,\" shouted the boys, in all manner of tones and general bewilderment. \n \n \"Stop it; stop it!\" yelled Si, his temper again rising. \"Great day, can\u0027t you fellers understand plain English when it\u0027s talked to you? What\u0027s the matter with you, anyway? Here, Bradshaw, when I give the order to count, you count one. Wheel wright, you count one at the same time. Williams and Talbot, you each count two. Then Aldrich, you and Reynolds count one, and so on.\" \n \n At last he got them to count to his satisfaction, and then proceeded to the next lesson. \n \n \"Now, at the command \u0027right face\u0027 everybody face to the right. The No. 1 men in the front rank stand fast. The No. 1 men in the rear rank take a side step to the right. The No. 2 men each take a side step to the right, and places himself on the right of No. 1.\" \n \n \"Great Jehosephat, Si,\" remonstrated Shorty; \"it\u0027ll take \u0027em a month to learn all that.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t care if it does,\" said Si desperately. \"They\u0027ve got to learn it sometime, and they can\u0027t learn no younger. Might as well begin now as any time. \u0027Tention! Right face!\" \n \n Si had hard work restraining the angry words which fumed up when he saw the execution of his command. Only a few had turned to the right. The rest had either stood still, turned to the left or were turning first one way and then another, to adjust themselves to those nearest them. \n \n \"Looks like a political primary just before the vote\u0027s called,\" remarked Shorty. \"Better git red rags to tie around their right hands, so\u0027s they\u0027ll know \u0027em.\" \n \n \"It\u0027ll be a shame to take them across the Ohio river in this shape,\" said Si in deep vexation. \"They\u0027ll shoot one another\u0027s heads off in the first fight, if they\u0027ve guns in their hands.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" answered Shorty consolingly. \"They\u0027ll pick it up mighty fast as soon as they see other fellers doing it, and \u0027ll be in purty good shape by the time we git \u0027em to the regiment. We was just as green as they are.\" \n \n Si repressed his petulant words with an effort, and started in to give them an ocular demonstration of the way to execute \"right face,\" but was interrupted by the Lieutenant coming up and saying: \n \n \"Here, we\u0027ve got to move right out to catch the ferryboat and the train on the other side. \u0027Tention! Pick up your bundles. Forward, march!\" \n \n The Recruits Lined up on the Platform. 186 \n \n Tactics were forgotten in a go-as-you-please rush on to the ferryboat, through the streets of Louisville, and on to the cars for Nashville. Everybody else was doing the same. The boat and streets were filled and the depot yard packed with men all pushing forward for the \"front.\" While Si, walking alongside the Lieutenant, led, Shorty and the rest of the detail brought up the rear. After they had scrambled into the old freight cars and stowed them selves away, Si looked over his squad and counted it. \n \n \"Have you got them all aboard, Sergeant?\" in quired Lieut. Bowersox. \n \n \"I\u0027ve got the right number, sir,\" Si answered, saluting; \"and if they ain\u0027t all the same men they\u0027re just as good.\" \n \n \"All right,\" returned the officer. \"I had 103 put in my charge to take to the regiment, and 103 men I must have when I get there.\" \n \n \"You shall have the full 103, Lieutenant,\" assured Shorty, \"if we have to snatch in a native or two to take the place of some that fall through the cracks.\" \n \n At Nashville the crowd and confusion were excessive; detachments of men of all kinds, sorts and conditions armed and unarmed recruits, convalescent veterans, men coming back from furlough, stragglers under guard, squads of Quartermaster\u0027s employees, gangs of railroad laborers and bridge-builders were all surging around, while their officers, superintendents, foremen, etc., shouted themselves hoarse in trying to get their men together and keep them so. When Si at last got his men on board, and the train had moved out, he was dismayed to find that he was five short. \n \n \"They was lost in that shuffle back there in the depot,\" said Shorty. \"Lucky it wa\u0027n\u0027t more. Wonder that we ever got through as well as we did.\" \n \n \"What in the world am I going to do?\" inquired Si dolefully. \"There\u0027s no use sending back for them. They\u0027ve probably got mixed up with some other squads, and gone the Lord knows where. They haven\u0027t sense enough to find their regiment in such a ruck as this.\" \n \n Si counted his men over again, with no better result. \n \n \"I\u0027ve got an idee,\" said Shorty, as Si came up to commune again with him as to the misfortune. \"I noticed five mighty lively young Irishmen in that bridge gang that\u0027s on the rear car, and I\u0027ve got a pint flash of whisky that some fellow was green enough to lay down while we was there in Nash ville. I\u0027m goin\u0027 back to that car on recruitin\u0027 duty.\" \n \n Si, unable to think of anything better, went with him. The train had stopped on a switch, and seemed likely to rust fast to the rails, from the way other trains were going by in both directions. The bridge gang, under charge of a burly, red-faced young Englishman, was in the rear car, with their tools, equipments, bedding and cooking utensils. \n \n The English foreman was a recent arrival in the country. This was his first employment here. Naturally surly and domineering, these qualities were enhanced by potations at Nashville and since leaving. \n \n Si and Shorty strolled up to the young Irishmen, who were standing on the ground near their car. They were very plainly recent arrivals, for they still wore the characteristic clothes of the Emerald Isle, and after a little conversation with them Shorty produced his bottle and offered them a drink. The foreman had watched them suspiciously, and he came swaggering up, saying insolently: \n \n \"\u0027Ere, you bloomin\u0027 sojer, Hi want you to keep haway from my men, hand not be a-givin\u0027 them drink. You stay by yourselves, hand Hi won\u0027t \u0027ave \u0027em hinterfered wi\u0027 by nobuddy.\" \n \n \"Your men,\" sneered Shorty. \"You talk as if they was niggers, and not white men. Who made \u0027em yours?\" \n \n \"Stow yer wid, ye bloody blue-jack,\" returned the foreman contemptuously, \"hand pull ha way from here. Hi never could bear sojers blokes, too lazy to work hand too cowardly to steal. Hike out o\u0027 here, and shut you \u0027ead, hif you know w\u0027at\u0027s well for you.\" \n \n \"Shut up your own head, you British blowhard,\" retorted Shorty, \"and mind your own business. Wait until you are a little longer in the country be fore you try to run it. And I don\u0027t want no more o\u0027 your slack. If you don\u0027t keep a civil tongue in your head I\u0027ll make you.\" \n \n The Englishman was just in the mood to be savagely tickled at the prospect of a fight. He had not had a good, square one since he had been in the country, and nothing yet had offered so gratifying as the prospect of polishing off one of the despised \"Hamerican sojers.\" Several of the hated officers had strolled up, attracted by the high words, and it would be an additional pleasure to thrash one of their men before their eyes, in revenge for the slights he felt they had put upon him. \n \n \"You won\u0027t fight,\" he said disdainfully, \"except with a gun or a knife, like a bloody Dago. Ye dassent put up yer \u0027ands like a man.\" \n \n For response, Shorty handed his cap, his gun, his bottle, his blanket-roll, his belt and haversack to Si, rolled up his sleeves, spit on his hands, doubled his fists, and stepped forward into a boxing attitude. \n \n \"Balance up to me, you beer-bloated Britisher,\" he exclaimed, \"and git naturalized by a real Star-Spangled Banner lickin\u0027 by an artist who kin comb down any man that owes allegiance to Queen Victoree. Here\u0027s a Heenan for your Tom Sayers.\" \n \n The Englishman began disrobing with an alacrity that showed how much his heart was in it. A ring was speedily formed, the officers, mainly Lieutenants and Captains, eagerly assisting, while keeping their eyes over their shoulders to see that no one of much higher rank was in the neighborhood. \n \n When the men confronted one another it was seen that they were a fairly-good match. The English man was stouter and heavier; he showed a splendid forearm, with corresponding swelling muscles near the shoulders, and the way he poised himself and put up his hands revealed that he had \"science\" as well as strength and courage. Shorty was taller and more spare, but he was quicker and had the longer reach. It looked as if the Englishman had the advantage, from his solid strength and staying power, as well as \"science.\" But those who looked on Shorty as inferior did not know of the training he had received among the turbulent crews of the Mississippi River boats. A man who had summered and wintered with that fractious race had little to learn in any trick or device of fighting. \n \n The first round showed that both were past-masters of ring tactics. Their wardings and layings for openings were so perfect that neither could get a blow in. \n \n When they stopped for a moment to breathe the Englishman said with frank admiration: \n \n \"Y\u0027re a heap better lot than Hi thort yer. Where\u0027d ye learn to handle yer dukes?\" \n \n \"Never mind where I learned,\" answered Shorty. \"I learned enough to git away with any English man that ever chawed roast beef.\" \n \n Again they closed, and sparred quick and hard for advantage, but neither succeeded in getting in any thing but light, ineffective blows. Each realized that the other was a dangerous man to handle, and each kept cool and watched his chances. When they took another second to breathe the Englishman said: \n \n \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to settle ye this time, young feller, in spite o\u0027 yer fibbin\u0027. Ye peck around me like a cock pickin\u0027 up corn, but I\u0027ll bust ye. Look hout for yerself.\" \n \n He made a savage rush to break through Shorty\u0027s guard by main force, but Shorty evaded him by a quick movement, the Englishman struck his toe against a piece of railroad iron, and fell to his knees. Shorty had him at his mercy, but he merely stepped back a little further, and waited for his opponent to rise and regain his position before he again advanced to the attack. \n \n The Englishman lost his coolness. Again he rushed savagely at Shorty, with less care in his guard. Shorty evaded his mighty blow, and reaching up under his guard struck him on the chin so hard that the Englishman fell like an ox. \n \n Shorty took him by the hand and helped him to his feet. \"Do you want any more? Have you got enough?\" he asked. \n \n \"Yes, Hi\u0027ve got enough,\" answered the English man. \"I\u0027m too groggy to go on. Hi\u0027ve been drink-in\u0027 a bit too much to \u0027andle myself wi\u0027 a first-class man like yerself. Y\u0027ve downed me, and y\u0027ve downed me fair, for Hi\u0027m not the man to whimper about not being fit. There\u0027s my hand. We\u0027re friends. We\u0027ll try hit again some day, when Hi\u0027ve got the likker out o\u0027 me; won\u0027t we?\" \n \n \"Certainly, whenever you like,\" said Shorty, shak ing hands with him. \n \n \"Say, cul,\" said the Englishman, in the friendliest sort of way, \"w\u0027at was ye wantin\u0027 around among my men?\" \n \n \"To tell you the truth,\" answered Shorty, \"I was after them to enlist with us. We lost five men in the shuffle at Nashville, and I was lookin\u0027 out for some to take their places. \n \n \"That\u0027s w\u0027at I thort,\" said the Englishman. \"That\u0027s w\u0027at I was afraid of. The \u0027ead bridge man \u0027as bin preachin\u0027 to me ever since \u0027e \u0027ired me, hand we made hup the gang in New York, to look hout hand keep my men from bein\u0027 enlisted. Say, youngster, his yours a good regiment?\" \n \n \"The very best in the army,\" unhesitatingly as serted Shorty. \"All free-born American citizens, and high-toned gentlemen. I tell you, they\u0027re daisies, they are.\" \n \n \"Hi don\u0027t \u0027know,\" said the Englishman meditatively, \"but Hi\u0027d like to see a little bit o\u0027 fightin\u0027 myself. Bridge buildin\u0027s \u0027eavy, \u0027ard work, and Hi wouldn\u0027 mind sojerin\u0027 a little while for a change.\" \n \n \"Come right along with me and this man,\" said Shorty catching on. \"You\u0027ll see the purtiest fighting to be found anywhere in the army, for the 200th Injianny kin do it up to the Queen\u0027s taste. And we\u0027ll treat you white. A better set o\u0027 boys never lived.\" \n \n \"Hi\u0027ll do hit,\" said the Englishman decidedly. \n \n \"Mebbe,\" suggested Shorty, remembering that this would still leave them four short, \"some o\u0027 your gang\u0027d like to come along with you.\" \n \n \"Some o\u0027 them,\" said the Englishman earnestly. \"Hevery bloomin\u0027 one o\u0027 them \u0027as got to go. They\u0027ve got to volunteer. Hif Hi find hany cowardly bloke that\u0027d rather be a beastly bridge-builder than a gentleman and a sojer, I\u0027ll pound \u0027is \u0027ead offen \u0027im. They\u0027ll all volunteer, I tell ye, w\u0027en Hi speak to \u0027em.\" \n \n Si had been quietly talking to the rest of the gang while this conversation was going on, and discovered a general willingness to exchange mechanical pursuits for those of a more martial character, and so when they left the train at Chattanooga, Lieut. Bowersox marched at the head of 130 recruits, instead of the 103 with whom he had crossed the Ohio River. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63267.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
