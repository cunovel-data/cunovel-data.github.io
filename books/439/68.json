{"id":45103,"no":68,"title":"CHAPTER II. THE BALKY MULES","content":"SUGGESTIONS GALORE \"SHELBYVILLE ONLY 18 MILES AWAY.\" NEVER was there so wild a storm but there was a wilder one; never such a downpour of rain but there could be a greater deluge. \"Seemed to me yesterday,\" said Si, on the morning of June 25, as he vainly tried to peer through the dashing drench and locate some of the other regiments of the division, \"that they was givin\u0027 us one of Noah\u0027s Deluge days that they\u0027d happened to have left over. Seemed that it couldn\u0027t be no worse, but this beats it. I don\u0027t think that standin\u0027 under Niagara Falls could be no worse. Howsomever, this can\u0027t last long. There ain\u0027t water enough in the United States to keep this up a great while.\" \"Don\u0027t be so sure o\u0027 that,\" said Shorty, handing Si the end of a blanket, that he might help wring it out. \"I believe the Lord sometimes thinks that He didn\u0027t divide the land and water jest right in the first place, and that He\u0027d better \u0027ve made a big lake o\u0027 Tennessee instead o\u0027 these old clay knobs for rebels and niggers to roost on, and He starts in to carry out that idee. I wish He\u0027d finish the job at once, and turn the whole blasted region over to the navy. It looks as if He had that in mind now.\" \"Well,\" said the ever-hopeful Si, \"the Bible says that the rain falls on the just and unjust alike. If it\u0027s tough on us, it\u0027s jest as tough on them. Their guns wouldn\u0027t go off any better\u0027n ours yesterday. If that regiment in front of us could\u0027ve shot like they can on a dry day they\u0027d \u0027ve made a sick time for us.\" About 60,000 union soldiers and 45,000 rebels struggled through the deluges of rain, the torrential streams and fathomless mud those June days, when it seemed that every water-gate of the heavens was wide open as it had never been before. The calamity that Si and Shorty had foreseen came about. The 200th Ind. lost the advance of the brigade and brought up the rear, which meant a long day of muscle-straining, temper-wrecking struggles with stalling wagons, discouraged mules and stupid teamsters. And as Co. Q was the left of the regiment, it caught the worst of all. The 200th Ind. had scarcely pulled out of camp when its troubles became acute. At the foot of the hill which had been carried the day before ran a brook, ordinarily quite a modest stream, but now raging like a mill-race. The two other regiments of the brigade and all of the 200th Ind. but Co. Q had managed to get across by means of trees which had been felled over the stream at various places. Co. Q was left behind to see that the teams got over, while the rest of the 200th Ind. was halted on the farther bank, to watch the operation and give help if needed. Si, with a squad in which was Shorty, was ordered to take the first team, which it happened Groundhog drove, down into the stream and start it across. \"Now, be very careful with that wagon,\" called the Adjutant across the stream. \"That has the Headquarters\u0027 things and papers. Don\u0027t let any water get into the bed. Cross at the shallowest place.\" Si and Shorty found some poles, and prodded around as well as they were able in the crossing to find the shallowest place. If there was a part so shallow that the bed could be kept above water it was very narrow, and would require exceedingly skillful driving to keep on it. The whole regiment stood around, like a barnyard full of turkeys on a wet day, and looked on with an air of soppy melancholy. \"Groundhog,\" said Si, approaching that function ary, \"was you watchin\u0027 carefully while me and Shorty was pickin\u0027 out the shallow places?\" \"Naw,\" answered he, insolently; \"wasn\u0027t watchin\u0027 nothin\u0027 but my mules. Got enough to do takin\u0027 keer o\u0027 them, without watchin\u0027 a couple o\u0027 fools projeckin\u0027 around with poles in a mud-hole. No sense in it, nohow. We never kin git acrost that \u0027ere tail-race. Only thing to do is to go back into camp till it quits rainin\u0027 and the water runs out.\" \"Groundhog,\" said Si resolutely, \"you\u0027re not goin\u0027 back to camp; you\u0027re not goin\u0027 to wait till it stops rainin\u0027. You\u0027re goin\u0027 right over now, as sure as my name\u0027s Si Klegg, or I\u0027ll break every bone in your karkiss.\" \"I can\u0027t go over,\" persisted Groundhog. \"I ain\u0027t no fool. I know better what kin be done with an army wagon and six mules than any Injianny galoot that ever wore stripes or shoulder-straps. You simply can\u0027t git a wagon acrost that branch, and I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to try.\" \"Groundhog,\" said Shorty, \"you\u0027ve bin itchin\u0027 to be killed for at least a year, that I know of probably as long as you\u0027ve lived. You ought\u0027ve had a stone tied to your neck and bin flung into the crick as soon\u0027s you was born. I\u0027ve promised myself a good many times that I\u0027d about murder you when ever I had time, but something\u0027s always made me neglect it. I\u0027m in the killin\u0027 mood to-day, and I\u0027d like to begin on you. I certainly will unless you drive that team straight acrost, and don\u0027t git a drop o\u0027 water in the bed o\u0027 the wagon.\" \"Come, hurry up, over there,\" shouted the Adjutant. \"We can\u0027t wait all day. What\u0027s the matter with you? Get a move on you.\" \"All right, sir; we\u0027ll start at once, sir,\" said Si with ostentatious alacrity. Shorty slapped his bayonet on, and brought the point very near Groundhog\u0027s abdomen. \"I\u0027ll jab this thing clean through you in a holy minute, you pusillanimous basswood cullin\u0027; you pestiferous pile o\u0027 pizen, rotten punk,\" he said savagely. \"Git on your wheel-mule and gether up the lines.\" Impelled by this, and the vigorous clutch of Si upon his collar, Groundhog climbed clumsily into the saddle and sullenly brandished his whip. The mules made a start and went down the bank, but at the edge of the turbid torrent the leaders set their legs as stiffly as if they were the supports of a sawhorse. They did not make a sound, but somehow the other four understood, with electric suddenness, and their legs set like posts. \"Jest as I expected,\" said Groundhog, with a grunt of satisfaction; \"they\u0027ve balked for all day, an\u0027 you can\u0027t git \u0027em to move another foot if you killed \u0027em. They\u0027re as solid as if they\u0027d growed there.\" With an air of having encountered the irresistible, he started to get out of his saddle. \"Stay in there, confound you,\" said Shorty, prodding him with his bayonet. \"Lick them mules. Make \u0027em start.\" \"\u0027Bout as much use in lickin\u0027 a white-oak stump,\" said Groundhog, plying the whip viciously as a relief to his feelings. \"You kin lick every inch of skin off \u0027em, and they won\u0027t move no more\u0027n a gravestone.\" \"Start those mules along. Stop fooling,\u0027 said the Adjutant impatiently. \"We can\u0027t start \u0027em. They\u0027re balkin\u0027, sir,\" said Si desperately. \"Nonsense, nonsense,\" said the Adjutant. \"Come ahead. Don\u0027t you see you\u0027re stopping the Second Brigade and all its teams?\" The men of the Second Brigade were already swarming across on the logs, while looking backward Si and Shorty could see the road filling up with teams. They ran down to the lead mules and caught them by the bridles and tried to pull them ahead. They might as well have pulled at the giant sycamore trees growing along the banks. Everybody now began to take an interest in the affair. It is one of the delightful peculiarities of human nature that everybody knows better how to manage a balky horse or mule than the unfortunate man who is trying to. \"Stop whippin\u0027 them mules. You only make them wuss,\" shouted one man authoritatively. \"Tie stones to their tails.\" \"Tie a string around their ears,\" shouted another. \"That\u0027ll be sure to start \u0027em.\" \"Bite their ears, you fools. Don\u0027t you know nothin\u0027 about mules? Bite their ears, I tell you,\" shouted a man from Indianapolis. \"Throw some hot water on \u0027em.\" \"Tie their feet and tails together with a string.\" \"Build a fire under \u0027em.\" \"Turn the harness around the other way on \u0027em.\" \"Blindfold \u0027em.\" Then the regimental humorists began to get in their work: \"Sing \u0027em the \u0027Battle Cry o\u0027 Freedom.\u0027\" \"They\u0027ve struck for more grub. Promise \u0027em double rations till we get to Shelbyville.\" \"Stop swearin\u0027, there, you fellers. You\u0027ve frozen \u0027em stiff with your bad language. Pray with \u0027em.\" \"Read them the Emancipation Proclamation.\" \"Call \u0027em pet names. You can do anything with kindness. Even a mule has, a heart.\" \"Bring up the band and serenade \u0027em.\" Shorty was raging around the team, kicking and striking first at one mule and then at another, and swearing like a pirate, alternately at the team and then at the jeering crowds. Si was following suit to the best of his ability, but his pious education had left him out of sight of Shorty when it came to using language that the occasion seemed to justify. He had, however, yanked Groundhog out of the saddle and driven him up the bank, where he sat down and grinned at the confusion which had overtaken his enemies. Setting a man at the head of each mule to coax and encourage him, and the rest of the company to pushing and prying on the wagon, Si had mounted the wheel-mule himself and put forth his mule-knowledge in one feverish effort, which was as futile as it was desperate, for the mules did not seem to change their positions for a rest, even, when the wagon was forced forward on them. A very dapper young Aid, fresh from West Point, and with that high appreciation for himself that can only be acquired at the United States Military Academy, galloped up, sternly ordering everybody to make way for him, and, \"Present the compliments of the Major-General commanding the division, and what the h—\u0027s the matter?\" \"Capt. McGillicuddy, to whom the young gentle man had been referred as in charge, said quietly: \"You see: A mule-team has balked and stopped everything. We\u0027re doing our best to start them, but so far without success.\" \"So we all perceive,\" said the young man superciliously. \"Why are you not down there directing them?\" \"The men that I have down there thoroughly understand mules, and are doing their very utmost. They are having, as you can see, a superfluity of advice which is not helping them. I can best help by letting them alone to work it out their own way. They will do all that men can.\" \"I shall report the case to the General,\" said the Aid, with scarcely-concealed insolence. \"Just like these confounded volunteers,\" he said as he turned away, taking no pains to keep the Captain from overhearing. \"Never will be genuine soldiers in the world. Here, my men,\" continued he, riding over to the wagon, \"stir yourselves lively, now, and start these wagons along. I want no more fooling, and won\u0027t have it. Start, now.\" Shorty had the usual volunteer dislike to young West Pointers; like the rest of the men he cordially hated and ridiculed the young and airy staff officers, whether from West Point or not. It irritated him to see the youngster\u0027s treatment of his Captain. Saying snappy things at and about the Captain was a privilege jealously reserved to members of the company. To have anybody outside abuse the Captain was an insult to be resented. Above all, his American soul rose in wrath at the patronizing \"my men.\" He would not have been at all offended at one of his own rough-and-ready officers jumping in and distributing curses on all hands, but \"my men\" was too much for him. Without appearing to notice the presence of the Aid, Shorty walked up to the lead-mule, gave him a tremendous kick in the ribs, and sung out in a tone loud enough to be heard across the roaring branch: \"You pernickety pile o\u0027 poll-evil; you hee-hawin\u0027 graduate o\u0027 West Point; you pin-feathered, taller-faced, pop-eyed, lantern-jawed, loud-mouthed Second Lieutenant, you, won\u0027t you git up?\" The other boys began to catch on and grin. The Aid\u0027s face flushed, but Shorty continued his loud objurgations at the mule: \"You misbegotten pill o\u0027 perdition; you pompous, puddin\u0027-headed staff officer; you miserable errand-boy for the General, puttin\u0027 on more airs than the General; you half-hatched officer, runnin\u0027 around yit with the shell on your head, and pretendin\u0027 to be cock-o\u0027-the-walk, won\u0027t you git up?\" Even the Aid began to understand the drift of Shorty\u0027s remarks by this time, and Capt. McGillicuddy called out warningly: \"Shorty! Shorty!\"\u0027 Si looked in amazement at this new development of his partner\u0027s genius. The officers and men on the other side of the branch seemed to have forgotten for the moment the annoyance of the balked team in enjoyment of Shorty\u0027s outburst. \"Why under heaven they put such murrain cattle as you in the army I can\u0027t tell,\" he continued with another savage kick in the mule\u0027s side. \"You only take up room from your betters. You don\u0027t fight, you only strut like a turkey-cock, and eat and he-haw. Now, will you git up?\" The Aid could not fail to understand now. He burst out in a torrent of rage: \"You infernal scoundrel,\" he shouted, forcing his horse up to Shorty; \"I\u0027ll have you shot for insubordination, for insulting and mutinous language to your superior officer.\" \"I wasn\u0027t sayin\u0027 nothin\u0027 to you,\" said Shorty, looking up with an air of surprise. \"I hain\u0027t had nothin\u0027 to do with you. I was cussin\u0027 this other piebald pilgarlic from West Point; this other pig headed pickaninny o\u0027 the Regular Army; this Brevet-Second Lieutenant o\u0027 the Quartermaster\u0027s Department, and Aid on the staff o\u0027 Gen. Groundhog. You ain\u0027t my superior officer, nohow.\" \"Corporal,\" shouted the Aid to Si, \"take this rascal up there on the bank and buck-and-gag him. Do it at once.\" \"I don\u0027t believe you have the right to give me orders, sir,\" said Si respectfully. \"I am under Capt. McGillicuddy\u0027s orders.\" \"You are right, Corporal,\" said Capt. McGillicuddy, stepping forward. \"Lieutenant, you cannot order one of my men to be punished. You have no right to command here. You are merely to convey the General\u0027s orders to those who are in command.\" \"I have the right to give orders. I represent the General, and speak in his name, and I order that man to be bucked-and-gagged,\" reiterated the Aid in a flame of anger. \"I\u0027ll see that it is done. I shall not be so insulted before the whole army. It will destroy all discipline.\" \"Fortunately, the discipline of the army does not depend on the respect shown Second Lieutenants,\" Capt. McGillicuddy could not help saying. \"If you have any complaint to make against one of my men, state it to me, their Captain, or to the Colonel of the regiment. We are the persons, not you, to deal with them.\" The men around understood; nothing pleased them better than to see a bumptious young Aid sat down upon, and they were outspoken in their delight. \"I shall report you to the General, and have you court-martialed,\" said the Aid, shaking his fist at Capt. McGillicuddy. \"I shall!\" \"Mr. Farwell,\" said the Chief of Staff, riding up, \"why haven\u0027t you reported to the General as to the trouble here? We\u0027ve been waiting for you.\" \"Here,\" came the clear-cut tones of the Colonel across the branch; \"no use of wasting any more time on those mules. They\u0027re there to stay. Unhitch them, fasten on a picket-rope, and we\u0027ll pull the wagon across from this side.\" Everybody sprang to execute this order, but Si and Shorty\u0027s hands had not reached the traces when an idea seemed to shoot simultaneously through each of the six mules, and with one impulse they plunged ahead, directly into the swollen waters. Si and Shorty sprang back toward their heads to guide them over the narrow crossing. But the mules seemed to take the right course by instinct, and landed the wagon safely on the other side, without a particle of water entering the bed. Everybody cheered, and Si and Shorty looked as if their minds had been relieved of a terrible load. \"Si,\" said Shorty, with a tinge of weariness in his tone, \"they say it is about 18 miles from here to Shelbyville.\" \"Somethin\u0027 like that,\" answered Si. \"I think there are about three o\u0027 these cricks to every mile. Do you really suppose we\u0027ll be able to git there before our three years is up?\" \"All depends on the mules,\" answered Si cheerily. \"If this sudden spell o\u0027 goodness holds out we may get there before evening.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63255.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
