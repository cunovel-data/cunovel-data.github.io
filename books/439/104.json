{"id":45139,"no":104,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. THE FRIGHTENED SURGEON","content":"SI AND SHORTY HAVE A TIME WITH THEIR WILD, YOUNG SQUAD. MUCH to their amazement, the boys waked up the next morning in Nashville, and found that they had passed through the \"dark and bloody ground\" of Kentucky absolutely without adventure. \"How in the world\u0027d we ever git clean through the State without the least bit o\u0027 trouble?\" asked Harry Joslyn, as they stood together on the platform awaiting the return of Si and Shorty, who had gone to see about their breakfast. \"It was fight from the word go with the other men from the minute they struck Kentucky.\" \"Probably it was Corpril Elliott\u0027s good management,\" suggested Gid Mackall, whose hero-worship of Shorty grew apace. \"I tell you there aint a trick o\u0027 soldierin\u0027 that he aint up to.\" \"Corpril Elliott\u0027s?\" sneered Harry Joslyn. \"You\u0027re just stuck on Corpril Elliott. If it was anybody\u0027s good management it was Sargint Klegg\u0027s. I tell you, he\u0027s the boss. He got shot through the breast, while Corpril Elliott only got a crack over the head. That settles it as to who\u0027s the best soldier. I\u0027m kind o\u0027 sorry that we didn\u0027t have no trouble. Mebbe the folks at home\u0027ll git the idea that we skulked and dodged.\" \"That\u0027s so,\" accorded the others, with a troubled look. \"But we are now in Tennessee,\" chirped in Gid Mackall hopefully. \"That\u0027s ever so much worse\u0027n Kentucky. We must come to rebels purty soon now. They won\u0027t let so many reinforcements git to Gen. Thomas if they kin help it.\" And Gid looked around on his companions, as if he thought their arrival would turn the scale and settle the fate of the Confederacy. \"They\u0027ll probably jump us just as soon as we leave town. Them big forts on the hills mebbe keeps them outside now, but they\u0027re layin\u0027 for us just beyond. Wonder if we\u0027ll git our guns here? Mebbe that\u0027s what the Sargint and Corpril\u0027s gone for.\" \"They said they were going for our breakfast,\" said Harry. \"And I hope it\u0027s true, for I\u0027m hungrier\u0027n a rip-saw. But I could put off breakfast for awhile, if they\u0027d only bring us our guns. I hope they\u0027ll be nice Springfield rifles that\u0027ll kill a man at a mile.\" \"\u0027Tention!\" commanded Si. \"Fall in single rank \u0027cordin\u0027 to your size. Tall boys on the right, short ones on the left, medium in the center. Gid Mackall, you\u0027re the tallest. You can go there to the corner o\u0027 the platform and let the others form on you.\" Si stepped back into the shed to look after some matters. Harry Joslyn whipped around and took his stand on the right of Gid Mackall. \"Here,\" protested Gid; \"Sargint Klegg told me to stand on the right. You\u0027re smaller\u0027n me. Git on the other side.\" \"I won\u0027t do it,\" answered Harry. \"I\u0027ve always stood ahead o\u0027 you in school, ever since we were in the primer class, and I aint goin\u0027 to stand behind you in the army. You needn\u0027t try to gouge me out o\u0027 my rights because you\u0027re half-a-head taller. I\u0027m two months older\u0027n you, and I can throw you in a wrastle every time.\" \"I tell you,\" said Gid, giving Harry an angry shove toward the left, \"that this is my place, and I\u0027m goin\u0027 to stand here. The Sargint told me to. Go down where you belong, you little rat.\" The hot-headed Harry mixed up with him immediately, school-boy fashion. Shorty rushed up and separated the two, giving Harry a sharp shake. \"Stop that, and go down to your place in the center,\" said he. \"Yes; you side with him,\" whimpered Harry, \"because he praises you and says you\u0027re a better soldier\u0027n Sargint Klegg. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to tell Sargint Klegg that.\" \"Here,\" said Si, sternly, as he came back again. \"What\u0027s all this row? Why don\u0027t you boys fall in \u0027cordin\u0027 to size, as I told you?\" \"Sargint,\" protested Harry, \"Gid Mackall wants to stand at the head o\u0027 the class. I\u0027m older\u0027n him, I can spell him down, and I can throw him in—\" Si interrupted the appeal by taking Harry by the ear and marching him to his place. \"Look here,\" he said, \"when you git an order from anyone, don\u0027t give \u0027em no back talk. That\u0027s the first thing you\u0027ve got to learn, and the earlier you learn it the less trouble you\u0027ll have. If you don\u0027t like it, take it out in swearin\u0027 under your breath, but obey.\" \"But, Sargint, he said that Corpril Elliott was a better soldier\u0027n\" \"Silence in ranks,\" said Si, giving him a shake. \"Right dress. Come out in the center. Mackall, stand up straight there. Take that hump out o\u0027 your shoulders. Put your heels together, all of you. Turn your toes out. Put your little fingers down to the seams o\u0027 your pantaloons. Draw your stomachs in. Throw your chests out. Hold your heads up. Keep your faces straight to the front, and cast your eyes to the right until you kin see the buttons on the breast o\u0027 the third man to your right. Come forward until they\u0027re in line. \"Goodness,\" moaned some of the boys, as they were trying to obey what seemed a\u0027 hopeless mass of directions, \"do we have to do this every mornin\u0027 before we kin have breakfast? We\u0027ll starve to death before we git anything to eat. No use tellin\u0027 us to draw our stomachs in. They\u0027re clean in to our backbones now.\" \"Mustn\u0027t talk in ranks, boys,\" Shorty kindly admonished. \"It\u0027s strictly agin\u0027 regulations. Straighten up, there, like soldiers, all o\u0027 you, and git into a line. Looks like a ram\u0027s horn now. If the rebels\u0027d shoot down that line they wouldn\u0027t hit one o\u0027 you.\" Jim Humphries, one of the medium-sized boys, suddenly turned as white as a sheet and fell on the planks. One after another of those around him did the same, until a half-dozen were lying there in a heap. \"What in the world\u0027s the matter?\" asked Si, rushing up to them in dismay. \"They\u0027re pizened, that\u0027s what they are,\" shouted Harry Joslyn. \"That guerrilla goin\u0027 over there pizened \u0027em. I saw him a-givin\u0027 \u0027em something. He\u0027s tryin\u0027 to git away. Le\u0027s ketch him.\" At the word the boys made a rush for the man who was quietly walking off. As they ran they threw stones, which went with astonishing precision and force. One of them struck the man on the head and felled him. Then the boys jumped on him and began pounding and kicking him. Si and Shorty came up, pushed off the boys and pulled the man to his feet. He was terrified at the onset which had been made upon him, and could not understand its reason. \"What\u0027ve I done?\" he gasped. \"What\u0027re all yo\u0027uns weltin\u0027 me for? I haint no rebel. I\u0027ve done tuk the oath of allegiance long ago.\" \"Now there\u0027ll be a hangin\u0027 sure,\" said Harry, in eager expectancy. \"What\u0027d you do to them boys back there?\" demanded Si. \"Didn\u0027t do nothin\u0027 to \u0027em. Sw\u0027ar to God A\u0027mighty I didn\u0027t.\" \"That telegraph pole will be just the thing to hang him on,\" suggested Harry to Gid. \"We could put him on a flat car and push the car out from under him. I\u0027ll look around for a rope, Gid, and you git ready to climb the pole.\" \"He did do something to \u0027em, Sargint,\" said Gid Mackall. \"I seen him givin\u0027 \u0027em something.\" \"\u0027Twas only a little mite o\u0027 terbacker,\" the man explained. \"They\u0027uns said they\u0027uns was mouty hongry, and wanted t\u0027 know if I\u0027d anything t\u0027 eat. I hadn\u0027t nothing, but I done had a little terbacker, which I tole \u0027em\u0027d take away the hongry feelin\u0027, and I gin each o\u0027 they\u0027uns a lettle chaw.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t wonder but he\u0027s tellin\u0027 the truth,\" Shorty whispered to Si. \"Le\u0027s take him back there and see.\" Coming back to the platform they found the boys there recovering but still very weak and pale. They confirmed the story about the tobacco. Shorty examined the rest of the tobacco in the man\u0027s possession with the practiced taste of a connoisseur, found it strong black plug, just the thing to upset a green boy who took it on an empty stomach, cut off a liberal chew for himself and dismissed the man with a kick. \"Now, le\u0027s form agin and march to breakfast. Great Scott, how hungry I am,\" said Si. \"\u0027Tention. Fall in \u0027cordin\u0027 to size. Single rank.\" \"What\u0027s size got to do with gittin\u0027 breakfast?\" complained Harry Joslyn, who had another grievance, now that he had again been disappointed in hanging a guerrilla. \"Biggest boys\u0027ll git there first and get the most to eat. The rest of us need just as much as they do.\" \"Silence in the ranks,\" commanded Shorty, snappishly. \"Don\u0027t fool around. Git into your place and stay there. We want breakfast some time today.\" Shorty lined up the boys in a hurry and Si commanded. \"Right dress! Come out a little there on the left! Steady! Without doublin\u0027, right face!\" A squad of Provost-Guards came up at a double-quick, deployed, surrounded the squad and began bunching the boys together rather roughly, using the butts of their muskets. \"What does this mean?\" Si asked angrily of the Lieutenant in command. \"It means that you and your precious gang have to go down to Provo\u0027 Headquarters at once,\" answered the Lieutenant. \"And no words about it. Forward, march, now.\" \"But you\u0027ve got no business to interfere with me,\" protested Si. \"I\u0027ve got my orders to take this squad o\u0027 recruits to my regiment, and I\u0027m doin\u0027 it. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to put \u0027em on the cars as soon\u0027s I kin git breakfast for \u0027em, and start for Chattanoogy.\" \"Well, why didn\u0027t you get breakfast for them and put them on the cars peaceably and quietly, without letting them riot around and kill citizens and do all manner of devilment. You have a fine account to settle.\" \"But they haint killed no citizen. They haint bin riotin\u0027 around, and I ain\u0027t a-goin\u0027 with you. You\u0027ve no right, I tell you, to interfere with me.\" \"Well, you just will go with me, and no more chinning.\" A Major, attracted by the altercation, rode up and asked what was the matter. \"Word came to Headquarters,\" explained the Lieutenant, \"that a squad of recruits were rioting, and had killed a citizen, and I was sent down here on the run to stop it and arrest the men. This Sergeant, who seems to be in command, refuses to go with me.\" \"I tell you, Major,\" said Si, who recognized the officer as belonging to his brigade, \"there was nobody killed, or even badly hurt. These little roosters got up a school-yard scrap all about a mistake; it was all over in a minute. There\u0027s the man they say was killed, settin\u0027 over there on that pile o\u0027 lumber smokin\u0027 his pipe.\" \"You\u0027re Si Klegg, aren\u0027t you, of the 200th Ind.?\" asked the Major. \"Yes, Major,\" answered Si, saluting. \"And you\u0027re Maj. Tomlinson, of the 1st Oshkosh. This is my pardner. Shorty.\" \"Glad to see you with Sergeant\u0027s stripes on,\" said the Major, shaking hands with him. \"I congratulate you on your promotion. You deserved it, I know.\" \"So did Shorty,\" added Si, determined that his partner should not lack full measure of recognition. \"Yes, I congratulate Shorty, too. Lieutenant, I know these men, and they are all right. There has been a mistake. You can take your men back to Headquarters.\" \"\u0027Tention,\" commanded the Lieutenant. \"Get into line! Right dress! Front! Right face! Forward, file left—march!\" \"\u0027Tention,\" commanded Si. \"Fall in in single ranks, \u0027cordin\u0027 to size. Be mighty spry about it. Right dress! Count off in whole numbers.\" Another Provost squad came double-quicking up, followed by some ambulances. Again the boys were hurriedly bunched up. The Provost squad, however, did not seem to want to come to as close quarters as the other had. They held back noticeably. \"Now, what in thunder does this mean?\" asked Si with angry impatience. \"What\u0027s up now?\" \"Sergeant, are you in command of this squad?\" asked a brisk little man with the green stripes of a Surgeon, who got out of one of the ambulances. \"Yes, I am,\" said Si, saluting as stiffly as he dared. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"Well, get those men of yours that are down into the ambulances as quickly as you can, and form those that are able to walk close behind. Be on the jump, because the consequences of your staying here may be serious to the army. How are you feeling yourself? Got any fever? Let me see your tongue.\" \"What in the world\u0027s the matter with you?\" asked Si in bewilderment. \"Come, don\u0027t waste any time asking questions,\" answered the nervous little Surgeon. \"There\u0027s more troops coming right along, and we mustn\u0027t take any chances of their catching it.\" \"Ketch what? Great grief, ketch what?\" groaned Si. \"They\u0027ve already ketched everything in this mortal world that was ketchable. Now what are they goin\u0027 to ketch?\" \"Why, the smallpox, you dumby,\" said the Surgeon irritably. \"Don\u0027t you know that we are terribly afraid of a visitation of smallpox to the army? They\u0027ve been having it very bad in some places up North, and we\u0027ve been watching every squad of recruits from up there like hawks. A man came down to Hospital Headquarters just now and reported that a dozen of your boys had dropped right on the platform. He said that he knew you, and you came from a place in Indiana that\u0027s being swept by the smallpox.\" Smallpox, Your Granny, Said si 237 \"Smallpox, your granny,\" said Si wrathfully. \"There haint bin no smallpox in our neighborhood since the battle o\u0027 Tippecanoe. The only man there who ever had it fit in the battle under Gen. Harrison. He had it when he was a child, and was so old that the pockmarks on him wuz wore so smooth you could scarcely see \u0027em. Our neighborhood\u0027s so healthy you can\u0027t even have a square case o\u0027 measles. Gosh darn it,\" Si exploded, \"what glandered fool was it that couldn\u0027t tell \u0027backer-sick from smallpox? What locoed calves have you runnin\u0027 up to your Headquarters bawlin\u0027 reports?\" \"Sir,\" said the Surgeon stiffly, \"you forget that you are speaking to your superior officer.\" \"Excuse me. Doctor,\" said Si, recovering himself and saluting. \"I\u0027m very hungry, and worried to death with these frisky kids that I\u0027m trying to git to my regiment. The only trouble is that some of the trundle-bed graduates took their first chaw o\u0027 terbacker this mornin\u0027 on empty stomachs and it keeled \u0027em over. Come here and look at \u0027em yourself. You\u0027ll see it in a minute.\" \"Certainly. I see it very plainly,\" said the Surgeon, after looking them over. \"Very absurd to start such a report, but we are quite nervous on the subject of smallpox getting down to the army. \"Take your men in and give them their breakfast, Sergeant, and they\u0027ll be all right. \"That\u0027s what I\u0027ve bin tryin\u0027 to do for the last two hours,\" said Si, as he saluted the Surgeon, departing with his ambulances and men. \"\u0027Tention. Confound you, fall in in single rank, \u0027cordin\u0027 to size, and do it in short meter, before anything else happens. Right dress! Front! Without doublin\u0027, right face! Great Scott, what\u0027s the matter with you roosters? Don\u0027t you know your right hands from your lefts? Turn around there, you moon-eyed goshngs! Forward—file right—march!\" \"Here, Sergeant,\" said a large man with three chevrons on his arm. \"I want to halt your men till I look \u0027em over. Somebody\u0027s gone through a sutler\u0027s car over there on the other track and I think it was your crowd. I want to find out.\" \"Halt nothin\u0027,\" said Si, brushing him out of the way. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to git these youngsters their breakfast before there\u0027s a tornado or an earthquake. Go \u0027way, if you know what\u0027s good for you.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63291.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
