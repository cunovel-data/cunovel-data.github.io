{"id":45116,"no":81,"title":"CHAPTER XV. KEYED UP FOR ACTION","content":"MARCHING INTO THE BATTLE OF CHICKAMAUGA. \n \n ALL of that eventful 19th of September, 1864, the men of Lieut. Bowersox\u0027s detachment were keyed up with the knowledge that they were heading straight for a desperate battle, and the main fear with Si, Shorty and the great majority was that they would not reach the field in time to take a hand in the affray. It seemed that never ran a locomotive at such a snail\u0027s pace as their engine was compelled to do over the wretched road bed and improvised bridges. The engineer, stimulated by the excitement and the urgent messages at every station, was doing his very best, but his engine was ditched once and narrowly escaped it a hundred times. The only curb to their impatience was the absolute knowledge that an attempt at faster running would result in not getting there in time at all. \n \n At every stopping place news from the front was eagerly sought for and canvassed. It was at all times aggressively meager. All that could be learned was that the whole rebel army was out on the Chickamauga some miles from Chattanooga, and savagely attacking the union army to drive it away and recapture the town. \n \n The news was generally very encouraging. Every attack of the rebels had been repulsed, though our own loss had been heavy. But every man was needed. The rebel lines extended far beyond those of the union army in each direction, and still they had enough for heavy assaulting columns. Everybody in the neighborhood of Chattanooga had been ordered up, leaving only the meagerest possible guards for the trains and communications. \n \n This increased the burning impatience of the boys to get where they could be of service. But it was far into the night when they finally skirted the frowning palisades of Lookout Mountain, and went into bivouac on the banks of Chattanooga Creek. All of the squad wanted guns, and Si and Shorty had been desperately anxious to get them for them. \n \n At the stopping places were squads of guards, men more or less sick, and men on detached duty. Whereever Si or Shorty\u0027s sharp search could find a gun not actually in use, or not likely to be, it was pretty sure, by some means or other, either openly or surreptitiously, to be gotten into the hands of one of the squad. In this way, by the time they arrived at Chattanooga, they had nearly half their men armed, and had given them some preliminary instruction in handling their guns. The Indianians needed little so far as loading and firing, for they were all natural marksmen, but to the Englishman and his Irish squad the musket was a thing of mystery and dread. \n \n \"An\u0027 is that the goon for me?\" said one of the Irishmen contemptuously, as Si proudly handed him a trusty Springfield he had found unwatched some where. \"That fool thing wid a bore no bigger\u0027n a gimlet hole? Fwhy, out in the ould country, when we go man-hunting, we take a goon wid a mouth like a funnel, that ye can put a hat full av balls inter. To the divil wid such a goon as this.\" \n \n \"Fix your mind on learnin\u0027 the kinks o\u0027 that gun, Barney,\" advised Shorty. \"One ball from it put in the right place \u0027ll do more than a hat full from your old Irish blunderbuss. A man that gits only one from it won\u0027t need nothin\u0027 more\u0027n a head stone and his name crossed offen the roster. Git a good squint at him through them sights, jest be low his belt, hold stiddy while you pull the trigger, and his name \u0027ll be mud.\" \n \n \"But fwhere is the powdher to make the ball go?\" persisted Barney, looking at the cartridge which Shorty had put in his hand. \n \n \"The powder is behind the ball in that paper bag,\" explained Shorty. \"You tear the paper with your teeth this way, and pour the powder into the muzzle.\" \n \n \"Fhat,\" said Barney contemptuously, surveying the cartridge. \"There isn\u0027t enough powdher there to throw a ball as far as Oi can a pebble. Fwhy, Oi used to put a whole handful o\u0027 powdher in the old blunderbuss. Oi wud do betther to whack a man wid a shillelah. And fwhere is the flint to stroike foire?\" \n \n \"O, the flintlock\u0027s played out, you flannel-mouthed Irishman,\" said Shorty irritably. \"It\u0027s as out-of-date as a bow and arrer. This\u0027s a percussion-lock; don\u0027t you understand? This is a cap. You stick it right on this nipple, an\u0027 when the hammer goes down off goes your gun. Don\u0027t you see?\" \n \n \"Well, you can say, maybe, an\u0027 maybe you can\u0027t But Oi can\u0027t. Take your old goon. Oi\u0027ll none avit. \n \n \"May the divil fly away wid it, an\u0027 wid you, too. Oi\u0027d rather have a good shtick. Wid a shtick in me fist Oi\u0027ll take care of ony spalpeen fwhat\u0027ll stand up in front av me. But wid a fool goon loike that Oi\u0027d be kilt at wance.\" \n \n While Si and Shorty were still worrying about what to do for arms for the remainder of their men, they heard what seemed to be about a company marching toward them through the darkness. \n \n \"I suppose we had better stop here and stack our arms out of the way,\" they heard the officer say who seemed to be in command. \"We\u0027ve got an all-night\u0027s job before us, fixing up that bridge, and getting those wagons across. Stack arms, boys, and leave your belts and traps with them. There\u0027s lots of work down there for us.\" \n \n They could see dimly the men obeying the orders, and going down the bank of the creek, where they started large fires to light them at their work. \n \n \"They have got a job ahead of \u0027em,\" remarked Shorty, looking in the direction of the fires. \n \n \"It\u0027ll take \u0027em all night and a large part o\u0027 tomorrow,\" said Si, significantly, as a thought entered his mind. \n \n \"Indeed it will,\" accorded Shorty, as the same idea occurred to him. \"An\u0027 they won\u0027t need their guns. They\u0027re only pioneers, anyway.\" \n \n \"If they do,\" chimed in Si, \"they kin pick up plenty more just as good around somewhere, when daylight comes. That\u0027s what pioneers is for.\" \n \n \"Si, you ketch on like a he snappin\u0027 turtle,\" said Shorty joyfully. \"We\u0027ll jest help ourselves to them guns and cartridge-boxes, and then move our camp over a little ways, and skeet out airly in the mornin\u0027 for the front, and we\u0027ll be all right. Don\u0027t say nothin\u0027 to the Lieutenant about it. He\u0027ll be all right, and approve of it, but he mustn\u0027t know anything of it officially. You git the men up and I\u0027ll go over and give the Lieutenant the wink and tell him that we\u0027ve found a much better bivouac about a mile further on.\" \n \n While the pioneers were struggling with their task, and the air down by the creek was filled with shouts and commands, Si and Shorty, with some of the others, quietly appropriated enough stands of arms to complete the equipment of their squad. \n \n Shorty took much credit for his honesty and forbearance that he did not touch a single one of the pioneers\u0027 belongings but their arms. A little later the squad was in bivouac a mile away. \n \n At the earliest dawn of Sept. 20 they were awake, and after a hasty breakfast moving out the Rossville road for the battlefield. Only an occasional shot from a nervous picket, peering into the deep fog, or angry spatter from a squad of scouting cavalry disturbed the stillness of the beautiful Autumn morning. The bright rays of the level sun were bringing out the rich tints of the maples and dog woods on the mountain-sides in all their gorgeous richness. Nature was smiling so benignantly on every side that it needed the turmoil and rush in the winding roads to remind one that somewhere near men were in bitter contrast with her divine serenity. But the roads were crowded with ammunition and ration wagons pushing out to the front, and with mounted officers and Orderlies making their way as rapidly as possible back and for ward with orders and messages. \n \n Lieut. Bowersox left the road with his detachment and made his way across the fields, over ditches, ravines and creeks, through the thickets and the brush, and at last came out on top of Missionary Ridge at the north side of Rossville Gap. \n \n With eager eyes they scanned the landscape of billowy mountains and hills to the east and south. \n \n A fog obscured all the lowlands, but far out columns of thin smoke rising lazily on the still air showed where 150,000 men were marshaling for bloody conflict. \n \n \"That Major I spoke to,\" said Lieut. Bowersox, as Si and Shorty looked anxiously in his face, \"is on the corps staff, and he says the whole infernal Southern Confederacy is out there for blood. They jumped us yesterday like a pack of famished wolves. But Rosecrans had just got his army together in time, though some of the divisions had to march till their tongues were hanging out. All the boys were dead game, though, and they stood the rebels off everywhere in great shape. He hasn\u0027t the faintest idea where the 200th Ind. is. The divisions and brigades have been jumped around from one end of the line to the other till he has but little more idea where any regiment is than if it was in the moon. The only way for us is to make our way as fast as we can to the front, where they need every man, and trust to luck to find the regiment. We\u0027ll probably not find it, but we\u0027ll find a place where they need us badly.\" \n \n \"Le\u0027s go ahead, then,\" said Si firmly, \"as fast as we can. We\u0027d much rather be with the regiment, but we\u0027ll take whatever comes wherever it comes, and do our level best.\" \n \n \"I know you will, Sergeant,\" answered the Lieutenant. \"Take another look over your men. See that they\u0027ve all cartridges, and caution them to keep cool, stay together, whatever happens, and listen to orders.\" \n \n Si felt a new and keener solicitude than he had ever before experienced. Hitherto his only thoughts were as to his own safety and to do himself credit in the discharge of his duty. Now he felt a heavy responsibility for every man in the detachment. \n \n He walked slowly down the front of the line, and looked into every man\u0027s face. They appeared anxious but resolute. The face of Wat Burnham, the Englishman, had settled into more of a bull-dog look than ever. The Irishmen seemed eager. Abel Waite, the boy on the left, was as excited as if a game of foot-ball was to come off. He called out: \n \n \"Say, Sergeant, I hain\u0027t got but 10 cartridges. Will that be enough?\" \n \n \"It\u0027ll have to be enough for the present,\" answered Si. \"Be careful of \u0027em. Don\u0027t waste none. Be sure o\u0027 your man, aim low, git under his belt, an\u0027 be careful to ketch your hind-sight before you pull the trigger. If we need more cartridges we\u0027ll have to find more somewhere.\" \n \n From away beyond the green and yellow waves of hills came the crash of the reopened battle. The ripping noise of regiments firing by volley was hoarsely punctuated by the deep boom of the field-pieces. \n \n \"Attention, company! Forward March!\" shout ed Lieut. Bowersox. \n \n They swept down the mountain-side, over the next eminence, and so onward. At every crest that they raised the uproar of the battle became louder, the crash of musketry and the thunder of the can non more continuous. The roads were so filled with teams being urged forward or backward that they could not follow them, but had to make their way through the woods and occasional fields, only keeping such direction as would bring them quickest to some part of the stormy firing-line. \n \n The Lieutenant and Si and Shorty tried to make themselves believe that the noise was receding, showing that the rebels were being driven. At times it certainly was so, and then again it would burst out, \n \n \"Nearer, clearer, deadlier than before,\" and their hearts would sink again. A little past noon they came upon a hight, and there met a sight which, for the moment, froze their blood. To their right front the whole country was filled with men flying in the wildest confusion. All semblance of regimental order was lost in the awful turmoil. Cannon, sometimes drawn by two or three horses, sometimes by only one, were plunging around amid the mob of infantrymen. Mounted officers were wildly galloping in all directions. Colors were carried to crests and ridges, and for a moment groups of men would gather around them, only to melt again into the mob of fugitives. From far behind came the yells of the exultant rebels, and a storm of shot and shell into the disorganized mass. \n \n The boys\u0027 hearts sickened with the thought that the whole army was in utter rout. For a minute or two they surveyed the appalling sight in speech less despair. Then a gleam of hope shot into Si\u0027s mind. \n \n \"Listen,\" he said; \"the firing is heavier than ever over there toward the center and left, and you can see that men are goin\u0027 up instid o\u0027 runnin\u0027 away. It\u0027s Stone River over again. McCook\u0027s bin knocked to pieces, just as he always is, but old Pap Thomas is standing there like a lion, just as he did at Stone River, and he\u0027s holding Crittenden with him.\" \n \n \"You\u0027re right, Si,\" shouted the Lieutenant and Shorty. \"Hip, hip, hooray for the Army o\u0027 the Cumberland and old Pap Thomas!\" \n \n They deflected to the left, so as to avoid being tangled up in the mass of fugitives, and pushed forward more determinedly, if possible, than ever. They kept edging to the right, for they wanted to reach Thomas\u0027s right as nearly as possible, as that was the natural position of their regiment. \n \n Presently, on mounting a roll of the ground, they saw sloping down from them a few rods away, and running obliquely to their right, a small \"deadening,\" made by the shiftless farmer for his scanty corn crop. A mob of fugitives flying through had trampled the stalks to the ground. Si and Shorty had seen some of them and yelled at them to come up and form on them, but the skedaddlers either would not or could not hear. \n \n Beyond the \"deadening\" came a horde of pursuing rebels, firing and yelling like demons. The sight and sound swelled the boys\u0027 hearts with the rage of battle. \n \n \"Lieutenant,\" suggested Si, \"there\u0027s no need o\u0027 goin\u0027 any further just now for a fight. We can have just as nice a one right here as we can find anywhere. I move that we line up back here and wait for them rebels to come on, an\u0027 then git \u0027em on the flank with an enfilade that\u0027ll salivate \u0027em in a holy minute.\" \n \n \"The same idea has occurred to me,\" said the Lieutenant; \"though I\u0027ve felt all along that we should not be diverted by anything from making our way as fast as possible up to the main line. What do you think, Shorty?\" \n \n \"My idee is to down a rebel whenever you git a good chance,\" said Shorty. \"\u0027Do the work nearest thy hand,\u0027 I once heard an old preacher say. Le\u0027s jump these hounds right here.\" \n \n \"All right,\" assented the Lieutenant quite willingly. \"Form the men just back of the edge of the woods. Keep them out of sight, and caution them not to shoot till they get the order. We must wait till we get the rebels just right.\" \n \n They Posted the Men Behind The Trees. 197 \n \n Si and Shorty hurriedly posted the men behind trees and rocks, cautioned them to wait for orders, and fire low, and then stationed themselves, one at the right, and the other at the left of the irregular line. They had scarcely done so when the rebels came surging through the \"deadening\" in a torrent. They were urged on by two mounted officers wear ing respectively the silver stars of a Colonel and a Major. \n \n \"The feller on the bay hoss\u0027s my meat,\" shouted Shorty from the left. \n \n \"All right,\" answered Si. \"I\u0027ll take the chap on the roan.\" \n \n \"Wait a little,\" cautioned the Lieutenant. \"We\u0027ll get more of them if you do. Now, let them have it. Ready Aim FIRE!\" \n \n Down went the Colonel and Major and fully 50 of their men. The Indiana recruits might be green as to tactics, but they knew how to level a gun. \n \n The startled rebels ceased yelling, and looked around in amazement in the direction whence the unexpected fire came. A few began firing that way, but the majority started to run back across the \"deadening\" to the sheltering woods. Groups gathered around the fallen officers to carry them back. \n \n \"Load as fast as you can, boys,\" commanded the Lieutenant. \"That was a good one. Give them an other.\" \n \n The young Irishmen were wild with excitement, and wanted to rush down and club the rebels, but the Lieutenant restrained them, though he could not get them to reload their guns. As Si was bringing down his gun he noticed the Englishman aiming at the groups about the officers. \n \n \"Don\u0027t shoot them. Fire at the others,\" Si called out, while he himself aimed at a man who was try ing to rally his comrades. \n \n \"W\u0027y the bloody \u0027ell shouldn\u0027t Hi shoot them the same has the hothers?\" snarled the Englishman, firing into the group. \"They\u0027re all bloody rebels.\" \n \n By the time the second round was fired the \"deadening\" was clear of all the rebels but those who had been struck. The others were re-forming on the knoll beyond, and a field-piece was hurried up to their assistance, which threw a shell over at the line. \n \n \"We had better move off,\" said the Lieutenant. \"They\u0027re forming out there to take us in flank, and we can\u0027t hold them back. We have done all that we can here, and a mighty good job, too. We have saved a lot of our men and salted a good bagful of rebels. Attention! File left March!\" \n \n \"That was a mighty good introduction for the boys,\" said Si to Shorty as they moved on through the woods. \"They begin to see how the thing\u0027s done; and didn\u0027t they act splendidly? I\u0027m proud of Injianny.\" \n \n \"Sergeant, didn\u0027t I do well?\" asked Abel Waite, in the tone that he would have inquired of his teacher about a recitation. \"I done just as you told me. I kep\u0027 my eye on the tall feller in front, who was wavin\u0027 his gun and yellin\u0027 at the rest to come on. I aimed just below his belt, an\u0027 he went down just like I\u0027ve seen a beef when pap shot him.\" \n \n \"Good boy,\" said Si, patting him on the shoul der. \"You\u0027re a soldier already.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63268.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
