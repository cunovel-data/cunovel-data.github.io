{"id":45090,"no":55,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. A PERIOD OF SELF-DISGUST","content":"SI AND SHORTY HAVE AN ATTACK OF IT, FOLLOWED BY RECOVERY. \n \n IT TOOK many days for the boys\u0027 lacerated feet to recover sufficiently to permit their going about and returning to duty. They spent the period of enforced idleness in chewing the cud of bitter reflection. The thorns had cut far more painfully into their pride than into their feet. The time was mostly passed in moody silence, very foreign to the customary liveliness of the Hoosier\u0027s Rest. They only spoke to one another on the most necessary subjects, and then briefly. In their sour shame at the whole thing they even became wroth with each other. Shorty sneered at the way Si cleaned up the house, and Si condemned Shorty\u0027s cooking. Thenceforth Shorty slept on the floor, while Si occupied the bed, and they cooked their meals separately. The newness of the clothes they drew from the Quartermaster angered them, and they tried to make them look as dirty and shabby as the old. \n \n Once they were on the point of actually coming to blows. \n \n Si had thoughtlessly flung some dishwater into the company street. It was a misdemeanor that in ordinary times would have been impossible to him. Now almost anything was. \n \n Shorty instantly growled:110 \n \n \"You slouch, you ought to go to the guard-house for that.\" \n \n Si retorted hotly: \n \n \"Slouch yourself! Look where you throwed them coffee-grounds this morning,\" and he pointed to the tell-tale evidence beside the house. \n \n Shorty and si Are at Outs. 110 \n \n \"Well, that ain\u0027t near so bad,\" said Shorty crustily. \"That at least intended to be tidy.\" \n \n \"Humph,\" said Si, with supreme disdainfulness. \"It\u0027s the difference betwixt sneakin\u0027 an\u0027 straightout. I throwed mine right out in the street. You tried to hide yours, and made it all the nastier. But111 whatever you do\u0027s all right. Whatever I do\u0027s all wrong. You\u0027re a pill.\" \n \n \"Look here, Mister Klegg,\" said Shorty, stepping forward with doubled fist, \"I\u0027ll have you understand that I\u0027ve took all the slack and impudence from you that I\u0027m a-goin\u0027 to.\" \n \n \"Shorty, if you double your fist up at me,\" roared the irate Si, \"I\u0027ll knock your head off in a holy minute.\" \n \n The boys of Co. Q were thunderstruck. It seemed as if their world was toppling when two such partners should disagree. They gathered around in voiceless sorrow and wonderment and watched, developments. \n \n Shorty seemed in the act of springing forward, when the sharp roll of the drum at Headquarters beating the \"assembly\" arrested all attention. Everyone looked eagerly toward the Colonel\u0027s tent, and saw him come out buckling on his sword, while his Orderly sped away for his horse. Apparently, all the officers had been in consultation with him, for they were hurrying away to their several companies. \n \n \"Fall in, Co. Q,\" shouted the Orderly-Sergeant. \"Fall in promptly.\" \n \n Everybody made a rush for his gun and equipments. \n \n \"Hurry up. Orderly,\" said Capt. McGillicuddy, coming up with his sword and belt in hand. \"Let the boys take what rations they can lay their hands on, but not stop to cook any. We\u0027ve got to go on the jump.\" \n \n All was rush and hurry. Si and Shorty bolted for their house, forgetful of their mangled feet. Si112 got in first, took his gun and cartridge-box down, and buckled on his belt. He looked around for his rations while Shorty was putting on his things. His bread and meat and Shorty\u0027s were separate, and there was no trouble about them. But the coffee and sugar had not been divided, and were in common receptacles. He opened the coffee-can and looked in. There did not seem to be more than one ration there. He hesitated a brief instant what to do. It would serve Shorty just right to take all the coffee. He liked his coffee even better than Shorty did, and was very strenuous about having it. If he did not take it Shorty might think that he was either anxious to make up or afraid, and he wanted to demonstrate that he was neither. Then there was a twinge that it would be mean to take the coffee, and leave his partner, senseless and provoking as he seemed, without any. He set the can down, and, turning as if to look for something to empty it in, pretended to hear something outside the house to make him forget it, and hurried out. \n \n Presently Shorty came out, and ostentatiously fell into line at a distance from Si. It was the first time they had not stood shoulder to shoulder. \n \n The Orderly-Sergeant looked down the line, and called out: \n \n \"Here, Corp\u0027l Klegg, you\u0027re not fit to go. Neither are you, Shorty. Step out, both of you.\" \n \n \"Yes, I\u0027m all right,\" said Shorty. \"Feet\u0027s got well. I kin outwalk a Wea Injun.\" \n \n \"Must\u0027ve bin using some Lightning Elixir Liniment,\" said the Orderly-Sergeant incredulously.. \"I saw you both limping around like string-halted113 horses not 15 minutes ago. Step out, I tell you.\" \n \n \"Captain, le\u0027 me go along,\" pleaded Si. \"You never knowed me to fall out, did you?\" \n \n \"Captain, I never felt activer in my life,\" asserted Shorty; \"and you know I always kept up. I never played sore-foot any day.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t believe either of you\u0027re fit to go,\" said Capt. McGillicuddy, \"but I won\u0027t deny you. You may start, anyway. By the time we get to the pickets you can fall out if you find you can\u0027t keep up.\" \n \n \"The rebel calvary\u0027s jumped a herd of beef cattle out at pasture, run off the guard, and are trying to get away with them,\" the Orderly-Sergeant hurriedly explained as he lined up Co. Q. \"We\u0027re to make a short cut across the country and try to cut them off. Sir, the company\u0027s formed.\" \n \n \"Attention, Co. Q!\" shouted Capt. McGillicuddy. \"Right face!—Forward, file left!—March!\" \n \n The company went off at a terrific pace to get its place with the regiment, which had already started without it. \n \n Though every step was a pang. Si and Shorty kept up unflinchingly. Each was anxious to outdo the other, and to bear off bravery before the company. The Captain and Orderly-Sergeant took an occasional look at them until they passed the picket-line, when other more pressing matters engaged the officers\u0027 attention. \n \n The stampeded guards, mounted on mules or condemned horses, or running on foot, came tearing back, each with a prodigious tale of the numbers and ferocity of the rebels.114 \n \n The regiment was pushed forward with all the speed there was in it, going down-hill and over the level stretch at a double-quick. Si felt his feet bleeding, and it seemed at times that he could not go another step, but then he would look back down the line and catch a glimpse of Shorty keeping abreast of his set of fours, and he would spur himself to renewed effort. Shorty would long to throw himself in a fence-corner and rest for a week, until, as they went over some rise, he would catch sight of Si\u0027s sandy hair, well in the lead, when he would drink in fresh determination to keep up, if he died in the attempt. \n \n Presently they arrived at the top of the hill from which they could see the rebel cavalry rounding up and driving off the cattle, while a portion of the enemy\u0027s horsemen were engaged in a fight with a small squad of infantry ensconced behind a high rail fence. \n \n Si and Shorty absolutely forgot their lameness as Co. Q separated from the column and rushed to the assistance of the squad, while the rest of the regiment turned off to the right to cut off the herd. But they were lame all the same, and tripped and fell over a low fence which the rest of the company easily leaped. They gathered themselves up, sat on the ground for an instant, and glared at one another. \n \n \"Blamed old tangle-foot,\" said Shorty derisively. \n \n \"You\u0027ve got hoofs like a foundered hoss,\" retorted Si. \n \n After this interchange of compliments they staggered painfully to their feet and picked up their115 guns, which were thrown some distance from their hands as they fell. \n \n By this time Co. Q was a quarter of a mile away, and already beginning to fire on the rebels, who showed signs of relinquishing the attack. \n \n \"Gol darn the luck!\" said Si with Wabash emphasis, beginning to limp forward. \n \n \"Wish the whole outfit was a mile deep in burnin\u0027 brimstone,\" wrathfully observed Shorty. \n \n A couple of lucky shots had emptied two of the rebel saddles. The frightened horses turned away from the fighting line, and galloped down the road to the right of the boys. The leading one suddenly halted in a fence-corner about 30 yards away from Si, threw up his head and began surveying the scene, as if undecided what to do next. The other, seeing his mate stop, began circling around. \n \n Hope leaped up in Si\u0027s breast. He began creeping toward the first horse, under the covert of the sumach. Shorty saw his design and the advantage it would give Si, and, standing still, began swearing worse than ever. \n \n Si crept up as cautiously as he had used to in the old days when he was rabbit-hunting. The horse thrust his head over the fence, and began nibbling at a clump of tall rye growing there. Si thrust his hand out and caught his bridle. The horse made one frightened plunge, but the hand on his bridle held with the grip of iron, and he settled down to mute obedience. \n \n Si set his gun down in the fence-corner and climbed into the saddle. \n \n Shorty made the Spring air yellow with profanity116 until he saw Si ride away from his gun toward the other horse. When the latter saw his mate, with a rider, coming toward him he gave a whinney and dashed forward. In an instant Si had hold of his bridle and was turning back. His face was bright with triumph. Shorty stopped in the middle of a soul-curdling oath and yelled delightedly: \n \n \"Bully for old Wabash! You\u0027re my pardner after all Si.\" \n \n He hastened forward to the fence, grabbed up Si\u0027s gun and handed it to him and then climbed into the other saddle. \n \n The rebels were now falling back rapidly before Co. Q\u0027s fire. A small part detached itself and started down a side road. \n \n Si and Shorty gave a yell, and galloped toward them, in full sight of Co. Q. who raised a cheer. The rebels spurred their horses, but Si and Shorty gained on them. \n \n \"Come on. Shorty.\" Si yelled. \"I don\u0027t believe they\u0027ve got a shot left. They hain\u0027t fired once since they started.\" \n \n He was right. Their cartridge-boxes had been emptied. \n \n At the bottom of the hill a creek crossing the road made a deep, wide quagmire. The rebels were in too much hurry to pick out whatever road there might have been through it. Their leaders plunged in, their horses sank nearly to the knees, and the whole party bunched up. \n \n \"Surrender, you rebel galoots.\" yelled Si reining up at a little distance, and bringing his gun to bear.117 \n \n \"Surrender, you off-scourings of secession,\" added Shorty. \n \n Si and Shorty As Mounted Infantry 117 \n \n The rebels looked back, held up their hands, and said imploringly: \n \n \"Don\u0027t shoot, Mister. We\u0027uns give up. We\u0027uns air taylored.\" \n \n \"Come back up here, one by one,\" commanded Si,118 \"and go to our rear. Hold on to your guns. Don\u0027t throw \u0027em away. We ain\u0027t afraid of \u0027em.\" \n \n One by one the rebels extricated their horses from the mire with more or less difficulty and filed back. Si kept his gun on those in the quagmire, while Shorty attended to the others as they came back. Co. Q was coming to his assistance as fast as the boys could march. \n \n What was the delight of the boys to recognize in their captives the squad which had captured them. The sanguinary Bushrod was the first to come back, and Si had to restrain a violent impulse to knock him off his horse with his gun-barrel. But he decided to settle with him when through with the present business. \n \n By the time the rebels were all up, Co. Q had arrived on the scene. As the prisoners were being disarmed and put under guard, Si called out to Capt. McGillicuddy: \n \n \"Captain, one o\u0027 these men is my partickler meat. I want to \u0027tend to him.\" \n \n \"All right. Corporal,\" responded the Captain, \"attend to him, but don\u0027t be too rough on him. Remember that he is an unarmed prisoner.\" \n \n Si and Shorty got down off their horses, and approached Bushrod, who turned white as death, trembled violently, and began to beg. \n \n \"Gentlemen, don\u0027t kill me,\" he whined. \"I\u0027m a poor man, an\u0027 have a fambly to support. I didn\u0027t mean nothin\u0027 by what I said. I sw\u0027ar\u0027t\u0027 Lord A\u0027mighty I didn\u0027t.\" \n \n \"Jest wanted to hear yourself talk—jest practicin\u0027 your voice,\" said Shorty sarcastically, as he took the119 man by the shoulder and pulled him off into the bush by the roadside. \"Jest wanted to skeer us, and see how fast we could run. Pleasant little pastime, eh?\" \"And them things you said about a young lady up in Injianny,\" said Si, clutching him by the throat. \n \n Bushrod Prays for his Life 119 \n \n \"I want to wring your neck jest like a chicken\u0027s. What\u0027d you do with her picture and letters?\" \n \n Si thrust his hand unceremoniously into Bushrod\u0027s pocket and found the ambrotype of Annabel. A brief glance showed him that it was all right, and he gave a sigh of satisfaction, which showed some amelioration of temper toward the captive.120 \n \n \"What\u0027d you do with them letters?\" Si demanded fiercely. \n \n \"Ike has \u0027em,\" said Bushrod. \n \n \"You\u0027ve got my shoes on, you brindle whelp,\" said Shorty, giving him a cuff in bitter remembrance of his own smarting feet. \n \n \"If we\u0027re goin\u0027 to shoot him, let\u0027s do it right off,\" said Si, looking at the cap on his gun. \"The company\u0027s gittin\u0027 ready to start back.\" \n \n \"All right,\" said Shorty, with cheerful alacrity. \"Johnny, your ticket for a brimstone supper\u0027s made out. How\u0027d you rather be shot—standin\u0027 or kneelin\u0027?\" \n \n \"O, gentlemen, don\u0027t kill be. Ye hadn\u0027t orter. Why do ye pick me out to kill? I wuzzent no wuss\u0027n the others. I wuzzent rayly half ez bad. I didn\u0027t rayly mean t\u0027 harm ye. I only talked. I had t\u0027 talk that-a-way, for I alluz was a union man, and had t\u0027 make a show for the others. I don\u0027t want t\u0027 be shot at all.\" \n \n \"You ain\u0027t answerin\u0027 my question,\" said Shorty coolly and inexorably. \"I asked you how you preferred to be shot. These other things you mention hain\u0027t nothin\u0027 to do with my question.\" \n \n He leveled his gun at the unhappy man and took a deliberate sight. \n \n \"O, for the Lord A\u0027mighty\u0027s sake, don\u0027t shoot me down like a dog,\" screamed Bushrod. \"Le\u0027me have a chance to pray, an\u0027 make my peace with my Maker.\" \n \n \"All right,\" conceded Shorty, \"go and kneel down there by that cottonwood, and do the fastest prayin* you ever did in all your born days, for you have need of it. We\u0027ll shoot when I count three. You\u0027d121 better make a clean breast of all your sins and transgressions before you go. You\u0027ll git a cooler place in the camp down below.\" \n \n Unseen, the rest of Co. Q were peeping through the bushes and enjoying the scene. \n \n Bushrod knelt down with his face toward the Cottonwood, and began an agonized prayer, mingled with confessions of crimes and malefactions, some flagrant, some which brought a grin of amusement to the faces of Co. Q. \n \n \"One!\" called out Shorty in stentorian tones. \n \n \"O, for the love o\u0027 God, Mister, don\u0027t shoot me,\" yelled Bushrod, whirling around, with uplifted arms. \"I\u0027m too wicked to die, an\u0027 I\u0027ve got a fambly dependin\u0027 on me.\" \n \n \"Turn around there, and finish your prayin\u0027,\" sternly commanded Shorty, with his and Si\u0027s faces down to the stocks of their muskets, in the act of taking deliberate aim. \n \n Bushrod flopped around, threw increased vehemence into his prayer, and resumed his recital of his misdeeds. \n \n \"Two!\" counted Shorty. \n \n Again Bushrod whirled around with uplifted hands and begged for mercy. \n \n \"Nary mercy,\" said Shorty. \"You wouldn\u0027t give it to us, and you hain\u0027t given it to many others, according to your own account. Your light\u0027s flickerin\u0027, and we\u0027ll blow it out at the next count. Turn around, there.\" \n \n Bushrod made the woods ring this time with his fervent, tearful appeals to the Throne of Grace. He was so wrought up by his impending death that he122 did not hear Co. Q quietly move away, at a sign from the Captain, with Si and Shorty mounting their horses and riding off noiselessly over the sod. \n \n For long minutes Bushrod continued his impassioned appeals at the top of his voice, expecting every instant to have the Yankee bullets crash through his brain. At length he had to stop from lack of breath. Everything was very quiet—deathly so, it seemed to him. He stole a furtive glance around. No Yankees could be seen out of the tail of his eye on either side. Then he looked squarely around. None was visible anywhere. He jumped up, began cursing savagely, ran into the road, and started for home. He had gone but a few steps when he came squarely in front of the musket of the Orderly-Sergeant of Co. Q, who had placed himself in concealment to see the end of the play and bring him along. \n \n \"Halt, there,\" commanded the Orderly-Sergeant; \"face the other way and trot. We must catch up with the company.\" \n \n Si and Shorty felt that they had redeemed themselves, and returned to camp in such good humor with each other, and everybody else, that they forgot that their feet were almost as bad as ever. \n \n They went into the house and began cooking their supper together again. Shorty picked up the coffeecan and said: \n \n \"Si Klegg, you\u0027re a gentleman all through, if you was born on the Wabash. A genuine gentleman is knowed by his never bein\u0027 no hog under no circumstances. I watched you when you looked into this coffee-can, and mad as I was at you, I said you was a thorobred when you left it all to me.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63242.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
