{"id":45070,"no":35,"title":"CHAPTER XI. WINTER QUARTERS","content":"THEY BUILT THEM A HOUSE AND GOT IN OUT OF THE RAIN. THE NEXT day Sunday after the battle dawned as clear, bright and sparkling as only a Winter\u0027s day can dawn in Tennessee, after a fortnight of doleful deluges. Tennessee Winter weather is like the famous little girl with the curl right down in the middle of her forehead, who, \"When she was good, she was very, very good, And when she was bad, she was horrid.\" After weeks of heart-saddening down-pour that threatened to drench life and hope out of every breathing thing, it will suddenly beam out in a day so crisp and bright that all Nature will wear a gladsome smile and life become jocund. When the reveille and the Orderly-Sergeant\u0027s brogans aroused Si and Shorty the latter\u0027s first thought was for the strip of canvas which he had secured with so much trouble from the wagon-cover, and intended to cherish for future emergencies. He felt his neck and found the strip that he had tied there, but that was all that there was of it. A sharp knife had cut away the rest so deftly that he had not felt its loss. Shorty\u0027s boiler got very hot at once, and he began blowing off steam. Somehow he had taken an especial fancy to that piece of canvas, and his wrath was hot against the man who had stolen it. Shorty Retaliates. 126 \"Condemn that onery thief,\" he yelled. \"He ought to be drummed out o\u0027 camp, with his head shaved. A man that\u0027ll steal ought to be hunted down and127 kicked out o\u0027 the army. He\u0027s not fit to associate with decent men.\" \"Why, Shorty,\" said Si, amused at his partner\u0027s heat, \"you stole that yourself.\" \"I didn\u0027t nothin\u0027 o\u0027 the kind,\" snorted Shorty, \"and don\u0027t want you sayin\u0027 so, Mr. Klegg, if you don\u0027t want to git into trouble. I took it from a teamster. You ought to know it\u0027s never stealin\u0027 to take anything from a teamster. I\u0027ll bet it was some of that Toledo regiment that stole it. Them Maumee River Muskrats are the durndest thieves in the brigade. They\u0027d steal the salt out o\u0027 your hardtack if you didn\u0027t watch \u0027em not because they wanted the salt, but just because they can\u0027t help stealin\u0027. They ought to be fired out o\u0027 the brigade. I\u0027m going over to their camp to look for it, and if I find it I\u0027ll wipe the ground up with the feller that took it. \u0027Taint so much the value of the thing as the principle. I hate a thief above all things.\" Si tried to calm Shorty and dissuade him from going, but his partner was determined, and Si let him go, but kept an eye and ear open for developments. In a few minutes Shorty returned, with jubilation in his face, the canvas in one hand and a nice frying-pan and a canteen of molasses in the other. \"Just as I told you,\" he said triumphantly. \"It was some o\u0027 them Maumee River Muskrats. I found them asleep in a bunch o\u0027 cedars, with our nice tent stretched over their thievin\u0027 carcasses. They\u0027d been out on guard or scoutin\u0027, and come in after we\u0027d gone to sleep. They were still snorin\u0027 away when I yanked the tent off, an\u0027 picked up their fryin\u0027-pan an\u0027 canteen o\u0027 molasses to remember \u0027em by.\"128 \"I thought you hated a thief,\" Si started to say; but real comrades soon learn, like husband and wife, that it is not necessary to say everything that rises to their lips. Besides, the frying-pan was a beauty, and just what they wanted. It became generally understood during the day that the Army of the Cumberland would remain around Murfreesboro\u0027 indefinitely probably until Spring to rest, refit and prepare for another campaign. Instructions were given to regimental commanders to select good camping ground and have their men erect comfortable Winter quarters. The 200th Ind. moved into an oak grove, on a gentle slope toward the south, and set about making itself thoroughly at home. Si and Shorty were prompt to improve the opportunity to house themselves comfortably. Si had now been long enough in the army to regard everything that was not held down by a man with a gun and bayonet as legitimate capture. He passed where one of the Pioneer Corps had laid down his ax for a minute to help on some other work. That minute was spent by Si in walking away with the ax hidden under his long overcoat. Those long overcoats, like charity, covered a multitude of sins. The ax was not sharp no army ax ever was, but Si\u0027s and Shorty\u0027s muscles were vigorous enough to make up for its dullness. In a little while they had cut down and trimmed enough oak saplings to make a pen about the size of the corn-crib at Si\u0027s home. While one would whack away with the ax the other would carry the poles and build up the pen. By129 evening they had got this higher than their heads, and had to stop work from sheer exhaustion. \"I\u0027ll declare,\" said Si, as they sat down to eat supper and survey their work, \"if father\u0027d ever made me do half as much work in one day as I have done to-day I should have died with tiredness and then run away from home. It does seem to me that every day we try a new way o\u0027 killing ourselves.\" \"Well,\" said Shorty, arresting a liberal chunk of fried pork on the way to his capacious grinders to cast an admiring glance on the structure, \"it\u0027s worth it all. It\u0027ll just be the finest shebang in Tennessee when we git it finished. I\u0027m only afraid we\u0027ll make it so fine that Gen. Rosecrans or the Governor of Tennessee \u0027ll come down and take it away for him self. That\u0027d just be our luck.\" \"Great Scott!\" said Si, looking at it with a groan; \"how much work there is to do yet. What are we goin\u0027 to do for a roof? Then, we must cut out a place for a door. We\u0027ll have to chink between all the logs with mud and chunks; and we ought to have a fireplace.\" \"I\u0027ve bin thinkin\u0027 of all them things, and I\u0027ve thunk \u0027em out,\" said Shorty cheerfully. \"I\u0027ve bin thinkin\u0027 while you\u0027ve bin workin\u0027. Do you know, I believe I was born for an architect, an\u0027 I\u0027ll go into the architect business after the war! I\u0027ve got a head plumb full of the natural stuff for the business. It growed right there. All I need is some more know-how an\u0027 makin\u0027 plans on paper.\" \"O, you\u0027ve got a great big head, Shorty,\" said Si, admiringly, \"and whatever you start to do you do splendid. Nobody knows that better\u0027n me. But what\u0027s your idee about the roof?\"130 \"Why, do you see that there freight-car over there by the bridge\" (pointing to where a car was off the track, near Stone River), \"I\u0027ve bin watchin\u0027 that ever since we begun buildin\u0027, for fear somebody else\u0027d drop on to it. The roof of that car is tin. We\u0027ll jest slip down there with an ax after dark, an\u0027 cut off enough to make a splendid roof. I always wanted a tin-roofed house. Old Jack Wilson, who lives near us, had a tin roof on his barn, an\u0027 it made his daughters so proud they wouldn\u0027t go home with me from meetin\u0027. You kin write home that we have a new house with a tin roof, an\u0027 it\u0027ll help your sisters to marry better.\" \"Shorty, that head o\u0027 your\u0027n gits bigger every time I look at it.\" Si and Shorty had the extreme quality of being able to forget fatigue when there was something to be accomplished. As darkness settled down they picked up the ax and proceeded across the fields to the freight-car. \"There\u0027s someone in there,\" said Si, as they came close to it. They reconnoitered it carefully. Five or six men, without arms, were comfortably ensconed inside and playing cards by the light of a fire of pitch-pine, which they had built upon some dirt placed in the middle of the car. \"They\u0027re blamed skulkers,\" said Shorty, after a minute\u0027s survey of the interior. \"Don\u0027t you see they hain\u0027t got their guns with \u0027em? We won\u0027t mind \u0027em.\" They climbed to the top of the car, measured off about half of it, and began cutting through the tin with the ax. The noise alarmed the men inside. They jumped out on the ground, and called up:131 \"Here, what\u0027re you fellers doin\u0027 up there? This is our car. Let it alone.\" \"Go to the devil,\" said Shorty, making another slash at the roof with the ax. \"This is our car, I tell you,\" reiterated the men. \"You let it alone, or we\u0027ll make you.\" Some of the men looked around for something to throw at them. Si walked to the end of the car, tore off the brake-wheel, and came back. \"You fellers down there shut up and go back in side to your cards, if you know what\u0027s good for you,\" he said. \"You\u0027re nothing but a lot of durned skulkers. We are here under orders. We don\u0027t want nothin\u0027 but a piece o\u0027 the tin roof. You kin have the rest. If any of you attempts to throw anything I\u0027ll mash him into the ground with this wheel. Do you hear me? Go back inside, or we\u0027ll arrest the whole lot of you and take you back to your regiments.\" Si\u0027s authoritative tone, and the red stripes on his arm, were too much for the guilty consciences of the skulkers, and they went back inside the car. The tearing off the roof proceeded without further interruption, but with considerable mangling of their hands by the edges of the tin. After they had gotten it off, they proceeded to roll it up and started back for their \"house.\" It was a fearful load, and one that they would not have attempted to carry in ordinary times. But their blood was up; they were determined to outshine everybody else with their tin roof, and they toiled on over the mud and rough ground, although every132 little while one of them would make a misstep and both would fall, and the heavy weight would seem to mash them into the ground. \"I don\u0027t wonder old Jake Wilson was proud of his tin roof,\" gasped Si, as he pulled himself out of a mudhole and rolled the tin off him and Shorty. \"If I\u0027d a tin roof on my barn durned if my daughter should walk home with a man that didn\u0027t own a whole section of bottom land and drove o\u0027 mules to boot.\" It was fully midnight before they reached their pen and laid their burden down. They were too tired to do anything more than lay their blankets down on a pile of cedar boughs and go to sleep. The next morning they unrolled their booty and gloated over it. It would make a perfect roof, and they felt it repaid all their toils. Upon measurement they found it much larger each way than their log pen. \"Just right,\" said Shorty gleefully. \"It\u0027ll stick out two feet all around. It\u0027s the aristocratic, fashion able thing now-a-days to have wide cornishes. Remember them swell houses we wuz lookin\u0027 at in Louisville? We\u0027re right in style with them.\" The rest of Co. Q gathered around to inspect it and envy them. \"I suppose you left some,\" said Jack Wilkinson. \"I\u0027ll go down there and get the rest.\" \"Much you won\u0027t,\" said Si, looking toward the car; \"there ain\u0027t no rest.\" They all looked that way. Early as it was the car had totally disappeared, down to the wheels, which some men were rolling away.133 \"That must be some o\u0027 them Maumee River Muskrats,\" said Shorty, looking at the latter. \"They\u0027ll steal anything they kin git away with, just for the sake of stealin\u0027. What on earth kin they do with them wheels?\" \"They may knock \u0027em off the axles an\u0027 make hearths for their fireplaces, and use the axles for posts,\" suggested Si. \"Here, you fellers,\" said Shorty, \"give us a lift. Let\u0027s have a house-raisin\u0027. Help us put the roof on.\" They fell to with a will, even the Captain assisting, and, after a good deal of trouble and more cut hands, succeeded in getting the piece of tin on top of the pen and bent down across the ridge-pole. Si and Shorty proceeded to secure it in place by putting other poles across it and fastening them down with ropes and strips of bark to the lower logs. \"Your broad cornice is aristocratic, as you say,\" said the Captain, \"but I\u0027m afraid it\u0027ll catch the wind, and tip your house over in some big storm.\" The House Beautiful. 133 \"That\u0027s so,\" admitted Shorty; \"but a feller that puts on airs always has to take some chances. I don\u0027t want people to think that we are mean and stingy about a little tin, so I guess we\u0027ll keep her just as she is.\" The next day they borrowed a saw from the Pioneers, cut out a hole for the door, and another for the fireplace. They made a frame for the door out of pieces of cracker-boxes, and hung up their bit of canvas for a door. They filled up the spaces be tween the logs with pieces of wood, and then daubed clay on until they had the walls tight. They gathered up stones and built a commodious fireplace, daubing it all over with clay, until it was wind and water tight. \"What are we goin\u0027 to do for a chimney, Si?\" said135 Shorty, as their fireplace became about breast-high. \"Build one o\u0027 sticks, like these rebels around here? That\u0027ll be an awful lot o\u0027 work.\" Solid Comfort. 135 \"I\u0027ve had an idee,\" said Si. \"I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to let136 you do all the thinkin\u0027, even if you are a born architect. When I was helpin\u0027 draw rations yesterday, I looked at the pork barrels, and got an idee that one of them\u0027d make a good chimney. I spoke to Bill Suggs, the Commissary-Sergeant, about it, and he agreed to save me a barrel when it was empty, which it must be about now. I\u0027ll go down and see him about it.\" Si presently came back rolling the empty barrel. They knocked the bottom out, carefully plastered it over inside with clay, and set it up on their fireplace, and made the joints with more clay. It made a splendid chimney. They washed the clay off their hands, built a cheerful fire inside, cooked a bountiful supper, and ate it in the light and comfort of their own fireside. It was now Saturday night. They had had a week of severer toil than they had ever dreamed of performing at home, but its reward was ample. \"Ah,\" said Shorty, as he sat on a chunk of wood, pipe in mouth, and absorbed the warmth, \"this is something like home and home comforts. It\u0027s more like white livin\u0027 than I\u0027ve had since I\u0027ve bin in the army. Let\u0027s act like men and Christians tomorrow, by not doin\u0027 a lick o\u0027 work o\u0027 any kind. Let\u0027s lay abed late, and then wash up all over, and go to hear the Chaplain preach.\" \"Agreed,\" said Si, as he spread out their blankets for the night. It had been threatening weather all day, and now the rain came down with a rush. \"Ain\u0027t that music, now,\" said Shorty, listening to the patter on the roof. \"Nothin\u0027 sounds so sweet as137 rain upon a tin roof. Let it rain cats and dogs, if it wants to. The harder the better. Si, there\u0027s nothin\u0027 so healthy to sleep under as a tin roof. I\u0027ll never have anything but a tin roof on my house when I git home. And we\u0027ve got the only tin roof in the regiment. Think o\u0027 that.\" But Si was too sleepy to think.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63222.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
