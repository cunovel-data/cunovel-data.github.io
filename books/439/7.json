{"id":45042,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI. DETAILED AS COOK—SI FINDS RICE ANOTHER INNOCENT","content":"WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CUSSEDNESS IN IT. \n \n IT WOULD have been very strange, indeed, if Si Klegg had not grumbled loudly and frequently about the food that was dished up to him by the company cooks. In the first place, it was as natural for a boy to grumble at the \"grub\" as it was for him to try to shirk battalion drill or \"run the guard.\" In the next place, the cooking done by the company bean-boiler deserved all the abuse it received, for as a rule the boys who sought places in the hash foundry did so because they were too lazy to drill or do guard duty, and their knowledge of cooking was about like that of the Irishman\u0027s of music: \n \n \"Can you play the fiddle, Pat?\" he was asked. \"Oi don\u0027t know, sor-r-r—Oi niver tried.\" \n \n Si\u0027s mother, like most of the well-to-do farmers\u0027 wives in Indiana, was undoubtedly a good cook, and she trained up her daughters to do honor to her teachings, so that Si undoubtedly knew what properly-prepared food was. From the time he was big enough to spank he had fared sumptuously every day. In the gush of patriotic emotions that prompted him to enlist he scarcely thought of this feature of the case. If it entered his mind at all, he felt that he could safely trust all to the goodness of so beneficent a Government as that for the preservation of which he had offered himself as a target for the rebels to shoot at. He thought it no more than fair to the brave soldiers that Uncle Sam should furnish professional cooks for each company, who would serve everything up in the style of a first-class city restaurant. So, after Si got down among the boys and found how it really was, it was not long till his inside was a volcano of rebellion that threatened serious results. \n \n Si Falls out With his Food 055 \n \n When, therefore, Si lifted up his voice and cried aloud, and spared not—when he said that he could get as good coffee as that furnished him by dipping his cup into a tan-vat; when he said that the meat was not good soap-grease, and that the potatoes and beans had not so much taste and nutrition in them as so much pine-shavings, he was probably nearer right than grumblers usually are. \n \n \"Give it to \u0027em, Si,\" his comrades would Say, when he turned up his loud bazoo on the rations question. \"They ought to get it ten times worse. When we come out we expected that some of us would get shot by the rebels, but we didn\u0027t calculate that we were going to be poisoned in camp by a lot of dirty, lazy potwrastlers.\" \n \n One morning after roll-call the Orderly-Sergeant came up to Si and said: \n \n \"There\u0027s been so much chin-music about this cooking-business that the Captain\u0027s ordered the cooks to go back to duty, and after this everybody\u0027ll have to take his regular turn at cooking. It\u0027ll be your turn to-day, and you\u0027ll stay in camp and get dinner.\" \n \n When Co. Q marched out for the forenoon drill. Si pulled off his blouse and set down on a convenient log to think out how he should go to work. Up to this time he had been quite certain that he knew all about cooking that it was worth while to know. Just now none of his knowledge seemed to be in usable shape, and the more he thought about it the less able he seemed to be to decide upon any way of beginning. It had always appeared very easy for his mother and sisters to get dinner, and on more than one occasion he had reminded them how much better times they had staying in the house cooking dinner than he had out in the harvest field keeping up with the reaper. At this moment he would rather have kept up with the fastest reaper in Posey County, on the hottest of July days, than to have cooked the coarse dinner which his 75 comrades expected to be ready for them when they returned, tired, hot and hungry, from the morning drill. \n \n Si Thinks It over 057 \n \n He went back to the barracks and inspected the company larder. He found there the same old, coarse, greasy, strong, fat pork, a bushel or so of beans, a few withered potatoes, sugar, coffee, bread, and a box of rice which had been collected from the daily rations because none of the cooks knew how to manage it. The sight of the South Carolina staple recalled the delightful rice puddings his mother used to make. His heart grew buoyant. \n \n \"Here\u0027s just the thing,\" he said. \"I always was fond of rice, and I know the boys will be delighted with it for a change. I know I can cook it; for all that you\u0027ve got to do is to put it in a pot with water and boil it till it is done. I\u0027ve seen mother do that lots o\u0027 times. \n \n \"Let\u0027s see,\" he said, pursuing his ruminations. \n \n \"I think each boy can eat about a cupful, so I\u0027ll put one for each of \u0027em in the kettle.\" \n \n \"There\u0027s one for Abner,\" he continued, pouring a cupful in for the first name on the company-roll; \"one for Acklin, one for Adams, one for Barber, one for Brooks,\" and so on down through the whole well-known list. \n \n \"It fills the old kettle tol\u0027bly full,\" he remarked, as he scanned the utensil after depositing the contribution for Williams, the last name on the roll; \"but I guess she\u0027ll stand it. I\u0027ve heard mother tell the girls that they must always keep the rice covered with water, and stir it well, so that it wouldn\u0027t burn; so here goes. Won\u0027t the boys be astonished when they have a nice mess of rice, as a change from that rusty old side-meat!\" \n \n He hung the kettle on the fire and stepped out to the edge of the parade-ground to watch the boys drilling. It was the first time he had had the sensation of pleasure of seeing them at this without taking part in it himself, and he began to think that he would not mind if he had to cook most of the time. He suddenly remembered about his rice and hurried back to find it boiling, bulging over the top like a small snowdrift. \n \n The Trouble Begins 059 \n \n \"I was afraid that kettle was a little too full,\" he said to himself, hurrying off for another campkettle, in which he put about a third of the contents of the first. \"Now they\u0027re all right. And it\u0027ll cook better and quicker in two than one. Great Scott! what\u0027s the matter? They\u0027re both boiling over. There must be something wrong with that rice.\" \n \n Pretty soon he had all the company kettles employed, and then all that he could borrow from the other companies. But dip out as much as he would there seemed no abatement in the upheaving of the snowy cereal, and the kettles continued to foam over like so many huge glasses of soda water. He rushed to his bunk and got his gum blanket and heaped upon it a pile as big as a small haycock, but the mass in the kettle seemed larger than it was before this was subtracted. \n \n He sweat and dipped, and dipped and sweat; burned his hands into blisters with the hot rice and hotter kettles, kicked over one of the largest kettles in one of his spasmodic rushes to save a portion of the food that was boiling over, and sent its white contents streaming over the ground. His misery came to a climax as he heard the quick step of his hungry comrades returning from drill. \n \n \"Right face; Arms a-port; Break ranks—March!\" commanded the Orderly-Sergeant, and there was a clatter of tin cups and plates as they came rushing toward him to get their dinner—something to stay their ravenous stomachs. There was a clamor of rage, ridicule, wrath and disappointment as they took in the scene. \n \n The Rice Gets the Bulge 061 \n \n \"What\u0027s the matter here?\" demanded the Captain, striding back to the company fire. \"You young rascal, is this the way you get dinner for your comrades? Is this the way you attend to the duty for which you\u0027re detailed? Waste rations in some fool experiment and scatter good food all over the ground? Biler, put on your arms and take Klegg to the guard-houae. I\u0027ll make you pay for this nonsense, sir, in a way that you won\u0027t forget in a hurry, I\u0027ll be bound.\" \n \n So poor Si marched to the guard-house, where he had to stay for 24 hours, as a punishment for not knowing, until he found out by this experience, that rice would \"s-well.\" The Captain wouldn\u0027t let him have anything to eat except that scorched and half-cooked stuff cut of the kettles, and Si thought he never wanted to see any more rice as long as he lived. \n \n Si Makes the Acquaintance of The Guard House 062 \n \n In the evening one of the boys took Si\u0027s blanket to him, thinking he would want it to sleep in. \n \n \"I tell ye, pard, this is purty derned tough!\" said Si as he wiped a tear out of the southwest corner of his left eye with the sleeve of his blouse. \"I think the Cap\u0027n\u0027s hard on a feller who didn\u0027t mean to do nothin\u0027 wrong!\" And Si looked as if he had lost all his interest in the old flag, and didn\u0027t care a pinch of his burnt rice what became of the union. \n \n His comrade \"allowed\" that it was hard, but supposed they, had got to get used to such things. He said he heard the Captain say he would let Si out the next day. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63194.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
