{"id":45087,"no":52,"title":"CHAPTER V. THE BOYS GO SPYING","content":"ON AN EXPEDITION WITH ROSENBAUM THEY MAKE A CAPTURE. \\n\\n \\n\\n MR. ROSENBAUM\u0027S stories of adventure were not such as to captivate the boys with the career of a spy. But the long stay in camp was getting very tedious, and they longed for something to break the monotony of camp guard and work on the interminable fortifications. Therefore, when Mr. Rosenbaum came over one morning with a proposition to take them out on an expedition, he found them ready to go. He went to Regimental Headquarters, secured a detail for them, and, returning to the Hoosier\u0027s Rest, found the boys lugubriously pulling over a pile of homespun garments they had picked up among the teamsters and campfollowers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose we\u0027ve got to wear \u0027em, Shorty,\" said Si, looking very disdainfully at a butternut-colored coat and vest. \"But I\u0027d heap rather wear a mustard plaster. I\u0027d be a heap comfortabler.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t myself finicky about clothes,\" answered Shorty. \"I ain\u0027t no swell—never was. But somehow I\u0027ve got a prejudice in favor of blue as a color, and agin gray and brown. I only like gray and brown on a corpse. They make purty grave clothes. I always like to bury a man what has butternut clothes on.\"69 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are you doing with them dirty rags, boys?\" asked Rosenbaum, in astonishment, as he surveyed the scene. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, we\u0027ve got to wear \u0027em, haven\u0027t we, if we go out with you?\" asked Si. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You wear them when you go out with me—you disguise yourselves,\" said Rosenbaum, with fine scorn. \"You\u0027d play the devil in disguise. You can\u0027t disguise your tongues. That\u0027s the worst. Anybody\u0027d catch on to that Indianny lingo first thing. You\u0027ve got to speak like an educated man—speak like I do—to keep people from finding out where you\u0027re from. I speak correct English always. Nobody can tell where I\u0027m from.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys had hard work controlling their risibles over Mr. Rosenbaum\u0027s self-complacency. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What clothes are we to wear, then?\" asked Si, much puzzled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wear what you please; wear the clothes you have on, or anything else. This is not to be a full-dress affair. Gentlemen can attend in their working clothes if they want to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand,\" mumbled Si. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course, you don\u0027t,\" said Rosenbaum gaily. \"If you did, you would know as much as I do, unt I wouldn\u0027t have no advantage.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right,\" said Shorty. \"We\u0027ve decided to go it blind. Go ahead. Fix it up to suit yourself. We are your huckleberries for anything that you kin turn up. It all goes in our $13 a month.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O. K.,\" answered Rosenbaum. \"That\u0027s the right way. Trust me, unt I will bring you out all straight. Now, let me tell you something. When you70 captured me, after a hard struggle, as you remember (and he gave as much of a wink as his prominent Jewish nose would admit), I was an officer on General Roddey\u0027s staff. It was, unt still is, my business to keep up express lines by which the rebels are supplied with quinine, medicines, gun-caps, letters, giving information, unt other things. Unt I do it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys opened their eyes wide, and could not restrain an exclamation of surprise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, hold your horses; don\u0027t get excited,\" said Rosenbaum calmly. \"You don\u0027t know as much about war as I do—not by a hundred per cent. These things are always done in every war, unt General Rosecrans understands the tricks of war better as any man in the army. He beats them all when it comes to getting information about the enemy. He knows that a dog that fetches must carry, unt that the best way is to let a spy take a little to the enemy, unt bring a good deal back. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The trouble at the battle of Stone River was that the spies took more to General Bragg than they brought to General Rosecrans. But General Rosecrans was new to the work then. It won\u0027t be so in future. He knows a great deal more about the rebels now than they know about him, thanks to such men as me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know as we ought to have anything to do with this, Shorty,\" said Si dubiously. \"At least, we ought to inquire of the Colonel first.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s all right—that\u0027s all right,\" said Rosenbaum quickly. \"I\u0027ve got the order from the Colonel which will satisfy you. Read it yourself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He handed the order to Si, who looked carefully71 at the printed heading, \"Headquarters, 200th Ind., near Murfreesboro\u0027, Tenn.,\" and then read the order aloud to Shorty: \"Corporal Josiah Klegg and one private, whom he may select, will report to Mr. Levi Rosenbaum for special duty, and will obey such orders and instructions as he may give, and on return report to these Headquarters. By order of the Colonel. Philip Blake, Adjutant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That seems all straight. Shorty,\" said Si, folding up the order, and putting it in his pocket. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Straight as a string,\" assented Shorty. \"I\u0027m ready, anyway. Go ahead, Mr. Cheap Clothing. I don\u0027t care much what it is, so long\u0027s it ain\u0027t shovelin\u0027 and diggin\u0027 on the fortifications. I\u0027ll go down to Tullahoma and pull old Bragg out of his tent rather than handle a pick and shovel any longer.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, as I was going to tell you, I have been back to Tullahoma several times since you captured me, unt I have got the express lines between here unt there running pretty well. I have to tell them all sorts of stories how I got away from the Yankees. Luckily, I have a pretty good imagination, unt can furnish them with first-class narratives. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But there is one feller on the staff that I\u0027m afraid of. His name is Poke Bolivar, unt he is a terrible feller, I tell you. Always full of fight, unt desperate when he gets into a fight. I\u0027ve seen him bluff all those other fellers. He is a red-hot Secessionist, unt wants to kill every Yankee in the country. Of late he has seemed very suspicious of me, unt has said lots of things that scared me. I want to settle him, either kill him or take him prisoner, unt keep him away, so\u0027s I can feel greater ease when I\u0027m in72 General Bragg\u0027s camp. I can\u0027t do that so long as I know he\u0027s around, for I feel that his eyes are on me, unt that he\u0027s hunting some way to trip me up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m going out now to meet him, at a house about five miles from the lines. I have my pockets unt the pockets on my saddles full of letters unt things. Just outside the lines I will get some more. He will meet me unt we will go back to Tullahoma together—that is, if he don\u0027t kill me before we get there. I have brought a couple of revolvers, in addition to your guns, for Poke Bolivar\u0027s a terrible feller to fight, unt I want you to make sure of him. I\u0027d take more\u0027n two men out, but I\u0027m afraid he\u0027d get on to so many. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess we two kin handle him,\" said Shorty, slipping his belt into the holster of the revolver and buckling it on. \"Give us a fair show at him, and we don\u0027t want no help. I wouldn\u0027t mind having it out with Mr. Bolivar all by myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, my plan is for you to go out by yourselves to that place where you were on picket. Then take the right-hand road through the creek bottom, as if you were going foraging. About two miles from the creek you will see a big hewed-log house standing on the left of the road. You will know it by its having brick outside chimneys, unt de doors painted blue unt yaller. There\u0027s no other house in that country like it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re to keep out of sight as much as you can. Directly you will see me come riding out, follered by a nigger riding another horse. I will go up to the house, jump off, tie my horse, go inside, unt presently come out unt tie a white cloth to73 a post on the porch. That will be a signal to Poke Bolivar, who will be watching from the hill a mile ahead. You will see him come in, get off his horse, unt go into the house. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By this time it will be dark, or nearly so. You slip up as quietly as you can, right by the house, hiding yourselves behind the lilacs. If the dogs run at you bayonet them. You can look through the windows, unt see me unt Bolivar sitting by the fire talking, unt getting ready to start for Tullahoma as soon as the nigger who is cooking our supper in the kitchen outside gets it ready unt we eat it. You can wait till you see us sit down to eat supper, unt then jump us. Better wait until we are pretty near through supper, for I\u0027ll be very hungry, unt want all I can get to keep me up for my long ride. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You run in unt order us to surrender. I\u0027ll jump up unt blaze away with my revolver, but you needn\u0027t pay much attention to me—only be careful not to shoot me. While you are \u0027tending to Bolivar I\u0027ll get on my horse unt skip out. You can kill Bolivar, or take him back to camp with you, or do anything that you please, so long\u0027s you keep him away from Tullahoma. You understand, now?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perfectly,\" said Shorty. \"I think we can manage it, and it looks like a pretty good arrangement. You are to git away, and we\u0027re to git Mr. Bolivar. Those two things are settled. Any change in the evening\u0027s program will depend on Mr. Bolivar. If he wants a fight he kin git whole gobs of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Going over the plan again, to make sure that the boys understood it, and cautioning them once more as to the sanguinary character of Polk Bolivar,74 Mr. Rosenbaum started for his horse. He had gone but a little ways when he came back with his face full of concern. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I like you boys better than I can tell you,\" he said, taking their hands affectionately, \"unt I never would forgive myself if you got hurt. Do you think that two of you\u0027ll be able to manage Poke Bolivar? If you\u0027re not sure I\u0027ll get another man to help you. I think that I had better, anyway.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, go along with you,\" said Shorty scornfully. \"Don\u0027t worry about us and Mr. Bolivar. I\u0027d stack Si Klegg up against any man that ever wore gray, in any sort of a scrimmage he could put up, and I\u0027m a better man than Si. You just favor us with a meeting with Mr. Bolivar, and then git out o\u0027 the way. If it wasn\u0027t for dividing up fair with my partner here I\u0027d go out by myself and tackle Mr. Bolivar. You carry out your share of the plan, and don\u0027t worry about us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Rosenbaum\u0027s countenance brightened, and he hastened to mount and away. The boys shouldered their guns and started out for the long walk. They followed Rosenbaum\u0027s directions carefully, and arrived in sight of the house, which they recognized at once, and got into a position from which they could watch its front. Presently they saw Rosenbaum come riding along the road and stop in front of the house. He tied his horse to a scraggy locust tree, went in, and then reappeared and fastened the signal to a post supporting the roof of the porch. \\n\\n \\n\\n Watching the House. 75 \\n\\n \\n\\n They had not long to wait for the answer. Soon a horseman was seen descending from the distant hill. As he came near he was anxiously scanned,75 and appeared a cavalier so redoubtable as to fully justify Rosenbaum\u0027s apprehensions. He was a tall, strongly-built young man, who sat on his spirited horse with easy and complete mastery of him. Even at that distance it could be seen that he was heavily armed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Looks like a genuine fighter, and no mistake,\" said Si, examining the caps on his revolver. \"He\u0027ll be a stiff one to tackle.\"76 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We must be very careful not to let him get the drop on us,\" said Shorty. \"He looks quicker\u0027n lightnin\u0027, and I\u0027ve no doubt that he kin shoot like Dan\u0027l Boone. We might drop him from here with our guns,\" he added suggestively. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Si, \"that wouldn\u0027t be fair. And it wouldn\u0027t be the way Rosenbaum wants it done. He\u0027s got his reasons for the other way. Besides, I\u0027d be a great deal better satisfied in my mind, if I could have it out with him, hand-to-hand. It\u0027d sound so much better in the regiment.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Guess that\u0027s so,\" assented Shorty. \"Well, let\u0027s sneak up to the house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When they got close to the house they saw that it had been deserted; there were no dogs or other domestic animals about, and this allowed them to get under the shade of the lilacs without discovery. The only inmates were Rosenbaum and Bolivar, who were seated before a fire, which Rosenbaum had built in the big fireplace in the main room. The negro was busy cooking supper in the outbuilding which served as a kitchen. The glass was broken out the window, and they could hear the conversation between Rosenbaum and Bolivar. \\n\\n \\n\\n It appeared that Rosenbaum had been making a report of his recent doings, to which Bolivar listened with a touch of disdain mingled with suspicion. \\n\\n \\n\\n The negro brought in the supper, and the men ate it sitting by the fire. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n 077 (80K) \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I declare,\" said Bolivar, stopping with a piece of bread and meat in one hand and a tin-cup of coffee in the other, \"that for a man who is devoted to the77 South you can mix up with these Yankees with less danger to yourself and to them than any man I ever knew. You never get hurt, and you never hurt any of them. That\u0027s a queer thing for a soldier. War means hurting people, and getting hurt yourself. It means taking every chance to hurt some of the enemy. I never miss any opportunity of killing a Yankee, no matter what I may be doing, or what the risk is to me. I can\u0027t help myself. Whenever I see a Yankee in range I let him have it. I never go near their lines without killing at least78 one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty\u0027s thumb played a little with his gunlock, but Si restrained him with a look. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Rosenbaum, \"I hates the enemy as badly as any one can, but I always have business more important at the time than killing men. I want to get through with what I have to do, unt let other men do the killing. There\u0027s enough gentlemen like you for that work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, there\u0027s not enough,\" said Bolivar savagely. \"It\u0027s treasonable for you to say so. Our enemies outnumber us everywhere. It is the duty of every true Southern man to kill them off at every chance, like he would rattlesnakes and wolves. You are either not true to the South, or you hain\u0027t the right kind of grit. Why, you have told me yourself that you let two Yankees capture you, without firing a shot. Think of it; a Confederate officer captured by two Yankee privates, without firing a shot.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They had the dead drop on me,\" murmured Rosenbaum. \"If I had moved they\u0027d killed me sure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dead drop on you!\" repeated Bolivar scornfully. \"Two men with muskets have the dead drop on you! And you had a carbine and a revolver. Why, I have ridden into a nest of 10 or 15 Yankees, who had me covered with their guns. I killed three of them, wounded three others, and run the rest away with my empty revolver. If I\u0027d had another revolver, not one would\u0027ve got away alive. I always carry two revolvers now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think our guns\u0027ll be in the way in that room,\" said Shorty, sotting his down. His face bore a look of stern determination. \"They\u0027re too long. I\u0027m itching to have it out with that feller hand-to-hand.79 We\u0027ll rush in. You pretend to be goin\u0027 for Rosenbaum and leave me to have it out with Mr. Bolivar. Don\u0027t you mix in at all. If I don\u0027t settle him he ought to be allowed to go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Si decisively. \"I\u0027m your superior officer, and it\u0027s my privilege to have the first shy at him. I\u0027ll \u0027tend to him. I want a chance singlehanded at a man that talks that way. You take care of Rosenbaum.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We mustn\u0027t dispute,\" said Shorty, stooping down and picking up a couple of straws. \"Here, pull. The feller that gits the longest \u0027tends to Bolivar; the other to Rosenbaum.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si drew and left the longer straw in Shorty\u0027s hand. They drew their revolvers and rushed for the room, Shorty leading, Rosenbaum and Bolivar sprang up in alarm at the sound of their feet on the steps, and drew their revolvers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Surrender, you infernal rebels,\" shouted the boys, as they bolted through the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n With the quickness of a cat, Rosenbaum had sidled near the door through which they had come. Suddenly he fired two shots into the ceiling, and sprang through the door so quickly that Si had merely the chance to fire a carefully-aimed shot through the top of his hat. Si jumped toward the door again, and fired a shot in the air, for still further make-believe. He would waste no more, but reserve the other four for Bolivar, if he should need them. \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty confronted Bolivar with fierce eyes and leveled revolver, eagerly watching every movement and expression. The rebel was holding his pistol pointed upward, and his eyes looked savage. As his eyes met Shorty\u0027s the latter was amazed to see him close the left with a most emphatic wink. Seeing this was recognized, the rebel fired two shots into the ceiling, and motioned with his left hand to Si to continue firing. Without quite understanding. Si fired again. The rebel gave a terrific yell and fired a couple of shots out the window. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do the same,\" he said to Shorty, who complied, as Si had done, in half-comprehension. The rebel handed his revolver to Shorty, stepped to the window and listened. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Surprise 79 \\n\\n \\n\\n There came the sounds of two horses galloping away on the hard, rocky road. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s gone, and taken the nigger with him,\" he said contentedly, turning from the window, and giving another fierce yell. \"Better fire the other two shots out of that pistol, to hurry him along.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty fired the remaining shots out of the rebel\u0027s revolver. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What regiment do you belong to, boys?\" asked Bolivar calmly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The 200th Ind.,\" answered Si, without being able to control his surprise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A very good regiment,\" said the rebel. \"What\u0027s your company?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Co. Q,\" answered Si. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who\u0027s your Colonel?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Col. Duckworth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who\u0027s your Captain?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Capt. McGillicuddy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right,\" said the rebel, with an air of satisfaction. \"I asked those questions to make sure you were genuine Yankees. One can\u0027t be too careful in my business. I\u0027m in the United States Secret Service, and have to be constantly on the watch to keep it from being played on me by men pretending to be Yankees when they are rebels, and rebels when they are Yankees. I always make it the first point to ask them the names of their officers. I know almost all the officers in command on both sides.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You in the Secret Service?\" exploded the boys.82 \\n\\n \\n\\n They were on the point of adding \"too,\" but something whispered to them not to betray Rosenbaum. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" answered Bolivar. \"I\u0027ve just come from Tullahoma, where I\u0027ve been around Bragg\u0027s Headquarters. I wanted to get inside our lines, but I was puzzled how to do it. That Jew you\u0027ve just run off bothered me. I wish to the Lord you\u0027d killed him. I\u0027m more afraid of him than any other man in Bragg\u0027s army. He\u0027s smart as a briar, always nosing around where you don\u0027t want him, and anxious to do something to commend him to Headquarters, Jew like. I\u0027ve thought he suspected me, for he\u0027d been paying special attention to me for some weeks. Two or three times I\u0027ve been on the point of tailing him into the woods somewhere and killing him, and so get rid of him. It\u0027s all right now. He\u0027ll go back to Tullahoma with a fearful story of the fight I made against you, and that I am probably killed. I\u0027ll turn up there in a week or two with my own story, and I\u0027ll give him fits for having skipped out and left me to fight you two alone. Say, it\u0027s a good ways to camp. Let\u0027s start at once, for I want to get to Headquarters as soon as possible.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got another revolver there,\" said Si, who had prudently reloaded his own weapon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s so,\" said Bolivar, pulling it out. \"You can take and carry it or I\u0027ll take the cylinder out, if you are not convinced about me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027d better let me carry it,\" said Shorty, shoving the revolver in his own belt. \"These are queer times, and one can\u0027t be too careful with rebels who83 claim to be Yankees, and Yankees who claim to be rebels.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They trudged back to camp, taking turns riding the horse. When the rebel rode, however, one of the boys walked alongside with the bridle in his hand. All doubts as to Bolivar\u0027s story were dispelled by his instant recognition by the Provost-Marshal, who happened to be at the picket-post when they reached camp. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The longer I live,\" remarked Shorty, as they made their way along to the Hoosier\u0027s Rest, \"and I seem to live a little longer every day, the less I seem to understand about this war.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty spoke as if he had had an extensive acquaintance with wars. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The only thing that I\u0027ve come to be certain about,\" assented Si, \"is that you sometimes most always can\u0027t generally tell.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And they proceeded to get themselves some supper, accompanying the work of denunciations of the Commissary for the kind of rations he was drawing for the regiment, and of the Orderly-Sergeant for his letting the other Orderlies eucher him out of the company\u0027s fair share. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63239.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
