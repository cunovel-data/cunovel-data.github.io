{"id":45143,"no":108,"title":"CHAPTER XXI. CHATTANOOGA AT LAST","content":"LOST IN A MAZE OF RAILROAD TRAINS. \"WHAT\u0027S the program?\" Si inquired of the conductor, as the boys were being formed on the bank, preparatory to entering the cars. \"I s\u0027pose it\u0027s to go over there and put in a week o\u0027 hard work rebuildin\u0027 that bridge. Have you got any axes and saws on the train? How long is the blamed old bridge, anyway?\" \"Not much it ain\u0027t,\" responded the conductor. \"If you think the army\u0027s goin\u0027 to wait a week, or even a day, on a bridge, you\u0027re simply not up to date, that\u0027s all. The old Buell and Rosecrans way o\u0027 doin\u0027 things is played out since Sherman took command. Your Uncle Billy\u0027s a hustler, and don\u0027t let that escape your mind for a minute, or it\u0027ll likely lead you into trouble. You\u0027ll find when you get down to Chattynoogy that nobody\u0027s asleep in daylight, or for a good part o\u0027 the night. They\u0027re not only wide-awake, but on the keen jump. The old man kin see four ways at once, he\u0027s always where he ain\u0027t expected, and after everybody with a sharp stick. In Buell\u0027s time a burnt bridge 50 foot long \u0027d stopped us for two weeks. Now that bridge \u0027ll likely be finished by the time we git there. I\u0027ve just been over there, and they were layin\u0027 the stringers.\" \"Why, how in the world did they manage?\" asked Si. \"O, Sherman\u0027s first move was to order down here duplicates for every bridge on the road. He\u0027s got \u0027em piled up at Louisville, Nashville, Murfreesboro and Chattynoogy. The moment a bridge is reported burned a gang starts for the place with another bridge, and they\u0027re at work as soon\u0027s it\u0027s cool enough to let \u0027em get to the abutments. I\u0027ve seen \u0027em pullin\u0027 away the burnin\u0027 timbers to lay new ones. They knowed at Chattynoogy as soon\u0027s we did that the bridge was burned. The operator at the next station must \u0027ve seen it and telegraphed the news, and they started a bridge-gang right out. I tell you, double-quick\u0027s the time around where old Cump Sherman is.\" \"Duplicate bridges,\" gasped Si. \"Well, that is an idee.\" \"What does he mean by duplicate, Corpril?\" asked Harry Joslyn to Shorty. \"O, duplicate\u0027s something that you ring in on a feller like a cold deck.\" \"I don\u0027t understand,\" said Harry. \"Why—hem—hem—duplicate\u0027s the new-fangled college word for anything that you have up your sleeve to flatten a feller when he thinks he\u0027s got you euchered. You want to deal the other feller only left bowers and keep the right bowers for yourself. Them\u0027s duplicates. If you give him aces, have the jokers handy for when you want \u0027em. Them\u0027s duplicates. Duplicates \u0027s Sherman\u0027s great lay—learned it from his old side-partner, Unconditional Surrender Grant—just as strategy was old McClellan\u0027s. There\u0027s this difference: Sherman always stacks the deck to win himself, while McClellan used to shuffle the cards for the other feller to win.\" \"Still I don\u0027t understand about the duplicate bridges,\" persisted Harry. \"Why, old Sherman just plays doublets on the rebels. He leads a king at \u0027em and then plumps down an ace, and after that the left and right bowers. They burn one bridge and he plumps down a better one instead. They blow up a tunnel and he just hauls it out and sticks a bigger one in its place. Great head, that Sherman. Knows almost as much as old Abe Lincoln himself.\" \"Do you say that Sherman has extra tunnels, too, to put in whenever one is needed?\" asked Harry, with opening eyes. \"O, cert,\" replied Shorty carelessly. \"You seen that big iron buildin\u0027 we went into to git on the cars at Louisville? That was really a tunnel, all ready to be shoved out on the road when it was needed. If you hadn\u0027t bin so keen on the lookout for guerrillas as we come along you\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 seen pieces o\u0027 tunnels layin\u0027 all along the road ready for use.\" As the train dashed confidently over the newly-completed bridge the boys gazed with intense interest and astonishment at the still smoldering wreckage, which had been dragged out of the way to admit the erection of the new structure. It was one of the wonders of the new, strange life upon which they were entering. The marvelous impressiveness and beauty of the scenery as they approached Chattanooga fascinated the boys, who had never seen anything more remarkable than the low, rounded hills of Southern Indiana. The towering mountains, reaching up toward the clouds, or even above them, their summits crowned with castellated rocks looking like impregnable strongholds, the sheer, beetling cliffs, marking where the swift, clear current of the winding Tennessee River had cut its way through the granite walls, all had a deep fascination for them. Then, everywhere were strong intrenchments and frowning forts, guarding the crossings of the river or the passages through the mountains. There were populous villages of log huts, some with canvas roofs, some roofed with clapboards, some with boards purloined from the Quartermaster\u0027s stores. These were the Winter quarters of the garrisons of the fortifications. Everywhere men were marching to and fro, and long trains of army wagons struggling through the mud of the valleys and up the steep hillsides. \"My, what lots o\u0027 men,\" gasped Harry Joslyn. \"We won\u0027t be once among sich a crowd. Wonder if Sergeant Klegg and Corpril Elliott kin keep us from bein\u0027 lost?\" \"Trust Corpril Elliott,\" said Gid, returning to his old partisanship of the taller veteran. \"He knows his business every time.\" \"Not any better\u0027n Sergeant Klegg,\" responded Harry, taking up the gantlet for his favorite. \"Long-legged men are very good in their way, but they don\u0027t have the brains that shorter men have. Nature don\u0027t give no man everything. What she gives to his legs she takes off his head, my dad says.\" \"That\u0027s just because you\u0027re a duck-legged snipe,\" answered Gid wrathfully. \"Do you mean to?\" \"Don\u0027t make any slurs at me, you spindle-legged sand-hill crane,\" retorted Harry. This was enough. Blows came next. It was their way. Gid Mackall and Harry Joslyn had been inseparable companions since they had begun going to school, and they had scarcely ever let a day pass without a fight. The moment that Si and Shorty appeared within their horizon they had raised the issue of which was the best soldier, and made it a matter of lively partisanship. Si and Shorty had been on the eager lookout for the indications of the position of the army, for places that they could recognize, and for regiments, brigades and divisions they were acquainted with, so they did not at first notice the squabble. Then they pulled the boys asunder, shook them and scolded them for their conduct. New emotions filled Si\u0027s and Shorty\u0027s breasts. They had been away from their regiment so long that they were acutely homesick to be back to it. Such is the magic of military discipline and association that their regimental flag had become the center of their universe, and the real people of their world the men who gathered around it. Everything and everybody else was subsidiary to that thing of wonderful sacredness—\"the regiment.\" They felt like wanderers who had been away for years, and were now returning to their proper home, friends, associations and vocation. Once more under the Flag life would become again what it should be, with proper objects of daily interest and the satisfactory performance of every-day duties. They really belonged in the regiment, and everywhere else were interlopers, sojourners, strangers in a strange land. They now sat together and talked of the regiment as they had formerly sat around the campfire with the other boys and talked of their far-away homes, their fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters and sweethearts. They had last seen their regiment in the fierce charge from the crest of Snodgrass Hill. The burning questions were who had survived that terrible day? Who had been so badly wounded as to lose his place on the rolls? Who commanded the regiment and the companies? Who filled the non-commissioned offices? What voices that once rang out in command on the drill-ground, in camp and battle, were now silent, and whose would be lifted instead? \"I\u0027m af eared the old rijimint will never fight agin as it did at Stone River and Chickamauga,\" said Si mournfully. \"Too many good men gone what made the rijimint what it is.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t know about that,\" said Shorty more hopefully. \"They got two mighty good non-commish when they promoted me and you. If they done as well in the rest o\u0027 the promotions, the rijimint is all right. Lord knows I\u0027d willingly give up my stripes to poor Jim Sanders, if he could come back; but I guess I kin yank around a squad as well as he done. This infant class that we\u0027re takin\u0027 down there ain\u0027t up to some o\u0027 the boys that\u0027ve turned up their toes, but they average mighty well, and after we git some o\u0027 the coltishness drilled out o\u0027 \u0027em they\u0027ll be a credit to the rijimint.\" The train finally halted on a side-track in the outskirts of Chattanooga, under the gigantic shadow of Lookout Mountain, and in the midst of an ocean of turmoiling activity that made the eyes ache to look upon it, and awed every one, even Si and Shorty, with a sense of incomprehensible immensity. As far as they could see, in every direction, were camps, forts, intrenchments, flags, hordes of men, trains of wagons, herds of cattle, innumerable horses, countless mules, mountains of boxes, barrels and bales. Immediately around them was a wilderness of trains, with noisy locomotives and shouting men. Regiments returning from veteran furlough, or entirely new ones, were disembarking with loud cheering, which was answered from the camps on the hillsides. On the river front steamboats were whistling and clanging their bells. The boys, too much awed for speech, clustered around Si and Shorty and cast anxious glances at their faces. \"Great Jehosephat,\" murmured Shorty. \"They seem to be all here.\" \"No,\" answered Si, as the cheers of a newly-arrived regiment rang out, \"the back townships are still comin\u0027 in.\" Monty Scruggs found tongue enough to quote: \"And ships by thousands lay below, And men by nations, all were his.\" \"Where in time do you s\u0027pose the 200th Injianny is in all this freshet of men and mules and bosses?\" said Si, with an anxious brow. The look made the boys almost terror-stricken. They huddled together and turned their glances toward Shorty for hope. But Shorty looked as puzzled as Si. \"Possibly,\" he suggested to Si, \"the conductor will take us further up into the town, where we kin find somebody that we know, who\u0027ll tell us where the rijimint is.\" \"No,\" said the conductor, who came back at that moment; \"I can\u0027t go no further with you. Just got my orders. You must pile right out here at once. They want the engine and empties in five minutes to take a load back to Nashville. Git your men out quick as you kin.\" \"Fall in,\" commanded Si. \"Single rank. Foller me and Corpril Elliott. Keep well closed up, for if you git separated from us goodness knows what\u0027ll become o\u0027 you in this raft o\u0027 men.\" The passage through the crowded, busy railroad yard was bewildering, toilsome, exciting and dangerous. The space between the tracks was scarcely more than wide enough for one man to pass, and the trains on either side would be moving in different directions. On the tracks that the boys crossed trains were going ahead or backing in entire regardlessness of them, and with many profane yells from the trainmen for them to get out of the way and keep out. Si only kept his direction by occasionally glancing over his shoulder and setting his face to walk in the direction away from Pulpit Rock, which juts out from the extremity of Lookout Mountain. At last, after a series of hair-breadth dodges, Si drew up his squad in an open space where the tracks crossed, and proceeded to count them.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63295.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
