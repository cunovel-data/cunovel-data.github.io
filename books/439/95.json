{"id":45130,"no":95,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. SI IS PROMOTED","content":"ANNABEL APPRISED OF IT—SHORTY MEETS JERUSHA. \\n\\n \\n\\n ANNABEL came in just as the reading of the letter was finished and her arrival caused a commotion in the family, as it always did, which momentarily distracted attention from the missive and Shorty\u0027s absence. She and the mother and daughters had to exchange kisses and news about the health of both families. Then she had to give a filial kiss to the Deacon, who had already begun to assume paternal airs toward her, and finally she got around to Si. Neither of them had yet got to the point of \"kissing before folks,\" and had to be content with furtive squeezing of hands. Si\u0027s heart was aching to have Annabel read Capt. McGillicuddy\u0027s letter, yet such was his shame-faced modesty that not for the world would he have alluded to it before the family. If he had been alone with her, he might have slipped the letter unopened into her hand, with a shy request for her to read it, but so sternly was the Deacon and his family set against anything like \"vainglory\" and \"self-praise\" that he could not bring himself to mention that such a letter had been received. At last, when full particulars had been given about the spread of measles and whooping-cough, who was to preach and who to be baptized at the coming quarterly meeting, Maria\u0027s active mind turned to things nearer Si\u0027s heart, and she said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, Si\u0027s got sich a nice letter from his officer-boss, his Corporal, or Colonel, or General, or whatever they call him—Mister—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My Captain—Capt. McGillicuddy, Maria,\" said Si, reddening at Maria\u0027s indifference to and ignorance of military titles. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Mr. McMillifuddy. Did you ever hear of such a ridiculous name?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"McGillicuddy—Capt. McGillicuddy, Maria. Why can\u0027t you get his name right?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, if I had sich a name as that I wouldn\u0027t expect people to git it right. There\u0027s no sense in havin\u0027 a Dutch name that makes your tongue crack like a whip. Well, this Mr. McFillemgoody is Si\u0027s boss, and he writes a nice letter, and says Si done so well at Chickamaugy that some other boss—a Colonel or Corporal—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The Colonel, Maria. The Colonel commands the whole regiment. Won\u0027t you never know the difference? A Colonel\u0027s much higher than a Corporal. You girls never will learn nothin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I never kin tell t\u0027other from which,\" replied Maria, petulantly. \"And I don\u0027t have to. I don\u0027t care a hill o\u0027 beans whether a Corporal bosses or a Colonel, or t\u0027other way. Anyhow, Si\u0027s no longer a Corporal. He\u0027s a Sargint.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, Si,\" said Annabel, her big blue eyes filling with grief; \"I\u0027m so sorry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, Annabel,\" said Si, considerably abashed; \"what\u0027s the matter? Don\u0027t you understand. I\u0027m promoted. Sergeant\u0027s higher than a Corporal.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it really?\" said Annabel, whose tears were beginning to come. \"It don\u0027t sound like it. Sargint don\u0027t sound near so big as Corporal. I always thought that Corporal was the very purtiest title in the whole army. None o\u0027 the rest o\u0027 them big names sounded half so nice. Whenever I saw Corporal in the papers I always thought of you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, you must learn to like Sergeant just as well,\" said Si, fondly squeezing her hand. \"Maria, let her read the letter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Mr. Gillmacfuddy does seem like a real nice, sociable sort of a man, in spite of his name,\" she commented, as she finished. \"And I like him, because he seems to be such a good friend o\u0027 yours. I s\u0027pose him and you board together, and eat at the same table when you are in the army, don\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, no, we don\u0027t,\" said Si patiently, for her ignorance seemed beautifully feminine, where Maria\u0027s was provoking. \"You see, dear, he\u0027s my Captain—commands about a hundred sich as me, and wears a sword and shoulder-straps and other fine clothes, and orders me and the rest around, and has his own tent, all by himself, and his servant to cook for him, and we have to salute him, and do jest what he says, and not talk back—at least, so he kin hear it, and jest lots o\u0027 things.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then I don\u0027t like him a bit,\" pouted Annabel. \"He\u0027s a horrid, stuck-up thing, and puts on airs. And he hain\u0027t got no business to put on airs over you. Nobody\u0027s got any right to put on airs over you, for you\u0027re as good as anybody alive.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si saw that this task of making Annabel under stand the reason for military rank was going to take some time, and could be better done when they were by themselves, and he took her out by the kitchen-fire to make the explanation. \\n\\n \\n\\n For the very first time in his whole life Shorty had run away from a crisis. With his genuine love of fighting, he rather welcomed any awkward situation in which men were concerned. It was a challenge to him, and he would carry himself through with a mixture of brass, bravado and downright hard fighting. But he would have much more willingly faced the concentrated fire of all the batteries in Bragg\u0027s army than Maria\u0027s eyes as she raised them from that letter; and as for the comments of her sharp tongue—well, far rather give him Longstreet\u0027s demons charging out of the woods onto Snodgrass Hill. He walked out into the barn, and leaned against the fanning-mill to think it all over. His ears burned with the imagination of what Maria was saying. He was very uncomfortable over what the rest of the family were thinking and saying, particularly the view that dear old Mrs. Klegg might take. With the Deacon and Si it was wholly different. He knew that, manlike, they averaged him up, one day with another, and gave him the proper balance to his credit. But Maria—there everything turned to gall, and he hated the very name of Bad Ax, the whole State of Wisconsin and everybody in it. He would never dare go back into the house and face the family. What could he do? There was only one thing—get back to his own home, the army, as soon as possible. \\n\\n \\n\\n Little Sammy Woggles came out presently to get some wood. Shorty called him to him. There was something fascinatingly mysterious in his tones and actions to that youth, who devoured dime novels on the sly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sammy,\" said Shorty, \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 away, right off, and I don\u0027t want the people in the house to know nothin\u0027 of it. I want you to help me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You bet I will,\" responded the boy, with his eyes dancing. \"Goin\u0027 to run away? I\u0027m goin to run away myself some day. I\u0027m awful tired o\u0027 havin\u0027 to git up in the mornin\u0027, wash my face and comb my hair, and do the chores, and kneel down at family prayers, and go to Sunday, school, and stay through church, and then have to spell out a chapter in the Bible in the afternoon. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to run away, and be a soldier, or go out on the plains and kill Injuns. I\u0027m layin\u0027 away things now for it. See here?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And he conducted Shorty with much mystery to a place behind the haymow, where he had secreted an old single-barreled pistol and a falseface. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You little brat,\" said Shorty, \"git all them fool notions out o\u0027 your head. This \u0027s the best home you\u0027ll ever see, and you stay here just as long as the Lord\u0027ll let you. You\u0027re playin\u0027 in high luck to be here. Don\u0027t you ever leave, on no account.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then why\u0027re you goin\u0027 to run away,\" asked the boy wonderingly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s my business. Something you can\u0027t understand, nohow. Now, I want you to slip around there and git my overcoat and things and bring \u0027em out to me, without nobody seein\u0027 you. Do it at once.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027sammy,\u0027 Said Shorty, \u0027i\u0027m Goin\u0027 Away Right Off, and I Don\u0027t Want the People to Know Nothin\u0027 of It.\u0027 113 \\n\\n \\n\\n While Sammy was gone for the things Shorty laboriously wrote out a note to Si upon a sheet of brown paper. It read: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Deer Si; ive jest red in the papers that the army\u0027s goin\u0027 2 \\n\\n move rite off. i no tha need me bad in the kumpany, for tha \\n\\n are short on Korprils, \u0026 tha can\u0027t do nothin\u0027 without \\n\\n Korprils. ive jest time 2 ketch the nekst traine, \u0026 ime \\n\\n goin\u0027 thare ez fast ez steme kin carry me. Good-by \u0026 luv 2 \\n\\n all the folks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yours, Shorty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There, Sammy,\" he said, as he folded it up and gave it to the boy; \"keep that quiet until about bed time, when they begin to inquire about me. By that time I\u0027ll \u0027ve ketched the train goin\u0027 east, and be skippin\u0027 out for the army. By the way, Sammy, can\u0027t you sneak into Miss Maria\u0027s room, and steal a piece o\u0027 ribbon, or something that belongs to her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got a big piece o\u0027 that new red Sunday dress o\u0027 her\u0027s,\" said Sammy, going to his storehouse and producing it. \"I cribbed it once, to make me a flag or something, when I\u0027d be out fightin\u0027 the Injuns. Will that do you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bully,\" said Shorty, with the first joyous emotion since the reception of the letter. \"It\u0027s jest the thing. Here\u0027s a half-dollar for you. Now, Sammy, kin you write?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027re makin\u0027 me learn, and that\u0027s one reason why I want to run away,\" with a doleful remembrance of his own grievances. \"What\u0027s the use of it, I\u0027d like to know? It cramps my fingers and makes my head ache. Simon Kenton couldn\u0027t write his own name, but he killed more Injuns than ary other man in the country. I guess you\u0027d want to run away, too, if they made you learn to write.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You little brat,\" said Shorty reprovingly; \"you don\u0027t know what\u0027s good for you. You do as they say, and learn to write as quick as you kin.\" Then, in a softer tone: \"Now, Sammy, I want you to promise to write me a long letter—two sheets o\u0027 foolscap.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, I never writ so much in all my life,\" protested the boy. \"It\u0027d take me a year.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, you\u0027ve got to, now, and it mustn\u0027t take you two weeks. Here\u0027s a dollar for you, and when I git the letter I\u0027ll send you home a real rebel gun. Now, you\u0027re to cross your heart and promise on your sacred word and honor that you\u0027ll keep this secret from everybody, not to tell a word to nobody. You must tell me all about what they say about me, and partickerlerly what Miss Maria says. Tell me everything you kin about Miss Maria, and who goes with her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What makes you like Maria better\u0027n you do \u0027Mandy?\" inquired the boy. \"I like \u0027Mandy lots the best. She\u0027s heap purtier, and lots more fun, and don\u0027t boss me around like Maria does.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s all you know about it, you little skeezics. She don\u0027t boss you around half as much as she ought to.\" Then gentler: \"Now, Sammy, do jest as I say, and I\u0027ll send you home a real rebel gun jest as soon as I get your letter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A real gun, that\u0027ll be all my own, and will shoot and kick, and crack loud?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, a genuine rebel gun, that you kin shoot crows with and celebrate Christmas, and kill a dog.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ll write you a letter if it twists my fingers off,\" said the boy joyously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you hope to be struck dead if you tell a word to anybody?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, indeedy,\" said the boy, crossing his heart earnestly. Shorty folded up the piece of dress goods tenderly, placed it securely in the breast-pocket of his blouse, and trudged over to the station, stopping on the summit of the hill to take a last look at the house. It was a long, hard walk for him, for he was yet far from strong, but he got their before train time. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was the through train to St. Louis that he boarded, and the only vacant seat that he could find was one partially filled with the belongings of a couple sitting facing it, and very close together. They had hold of one another\u0027s hands, and quite clearly were dressed better than they were accustomed to. The man was approaching middle age, and wore a shiny silk hat, a suit of broadcloth, with a satin vest, and a heavy silver watch chain. His face was rather strong and hard, and showed exposure to rough weather. The woman was not so much younger, was tall and angular, rather uncomfortably conscious of her good clothes, and had a firm, settled look about her mouth and eyes, which only partially disappeared in response to the man\u0027s persistent endearments. Still, she seemed more annoyed than he did at the seating of another party in front of them, whose eyes would be upon them. The man lifted the things to make room for Shorty, who commented to himself: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Should think they was bride and groom, if they wasn\u0027t so old.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a vague hint that he had seen the face somewhere, but he dismissed it, then settled himself, and, busy with his own thoughts, pressed his face against the window, and tried to recognize through the darkness the objects by which they were rushing. They were all deeply interesting to him, for they were part of Maria\u0027s home and surroundings. After awhile the man appeared temporarily tired of billing and cooing, and thought conversation with some one else would give variety to the trip. He opened their lunch-basket, took out something for himself and his companion to eat, nudged Shorty, and offered him a generous handful. Shorty promptly accepted, for he had the perennial hunger of convalescence, and his supper had been interrupted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Going back to the army?\" inquired the man, with his mouth full of chicken, and by way of opening up the conversation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Um—huh,\" said Shorty, nodding assent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where do you belong?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"200th Injianny Volunteer Infantry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n If Shorty had been noticing the woman he would have seen her start, but would have attributed it to the lurching of the cars. She lost interest in the chicken leg she was picking, and listened to the continuance of the conversation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I mean, what army do you belong to?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Army o\u0027 the Cumberland, down at Chattanoogy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed; I might say that I belong to that army myself. I\u0027m going down that way, too. You see, my Congressman helped me get a contract for furnishing the Army o\u0027 the Cumberland with bridge timber, and I\u0027m going down to Looeyville, and mebbe further, to see about it. We\u0027ve just come from St. Louis, where I\u0027ve bin deliverin\u0027 some timber in rafts.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where are you from?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bad Ax, Wisconsin, a little ways from La Crosse.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was Shorty\u0027s turn to start, and it flashed upon him just where he had seen that squarish face. It was in an ambrotype that he carried in his breastpocket. He almost choked on the merrythought of the chicken, but recovered himself, and said quickly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have heard o\u0027 the place. Lived there long?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Always, you might say. Father took me there as a child during the mine excitement, growed up there, went into business, married, lost my wife, and married again. We\u0027re now on what you might call our bridal tower. I had to come down here on business, so I brung my wife along, and worked it off on her as our bridal tower. Purty cute, don\u0027t you think?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And he reached over and tried to squeeze his wife\u0027s hand, but she repulsed it. \\n\\n \\n\\n The bridegroom plied Shorty with questions as to the army for awhile after they had finished eating, and then arose and remarked: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 into the smokin\u0027-car for a smoke. Won\u0027t you come along with me, soldier, and have a cigar?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, thankee,\" answered Shorty. \"I\u0027d like to, awfully, but the doctor\u0027s shut down on my smokin\u0027 till I git well.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As soon as he was well on his way the woman leaned forward and asked Shorty in an earnest tone: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you say that you belonged to the 200th Ind.?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes\u0027m,\" said Shorty very meekly. \"To Co. Q.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The very same company,\" gasped the woman. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you happen to know a Mr. Daniel Elliott in that company?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well, mum. Knowed him almost as well as if he was my own brother.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What sort of a man was he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Awful nice feller. I thought a heap of him. Thought more of him than any other man in the company. A nicer man you never knowed. Didn\u0027t drink, nor swear, nor play cards, nor chaw terbacker. Used to go to church every Sunday. Chaplain thought a heap of him. Used to call him his right bower—I mean his strong suit—I mean his two pair—ace high. No, neither o\u0027 them\u0027s just the word the Chaplain used, but it was something just as good, but more Bible-like.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m so glad to hear it,\" murmured the woman. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, he was an ornament to the army,\" continued the unblushing Shorty, who hadn\u0027t had a good opportunity to lie in all the weeks that the Deacon had been with him, and wanted to exercise his old talent, to see whether he had lost it. \"And the handsomest man! There wasn\u0027t a finer-looking man in the whole army. The Colonel used to get awfully jealous o\u0027 him, because everybody that\u0027d come into camp \u0027d mistake him for the Colonel. He\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 bin Colonel, too, if he\u0027d only lived. But the poor fellow broke his heart. He fell in love with a girl somewhere up North—Pewter Hatchet, or some place like that. I never saw her, and don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 about her, but I heard that the boys from her place said that she was no match for him. She was only plain, ordinary-lookin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That wasn\u0027t true,\" said the woman, under her breath. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All the same, Elliott was dead-stuck on her. Bimeby he heard some way that some stay-at-home widower was settin\u0027 up to her, and she was encouragin\u0027 him, and finally married him. When Elliott heard that he was completely beside himself. He lost all appetite for everything but whisky and the blood of widowers. Whenever he found a man who was a widower he wanted to kill him. At Chickamauga, he\u0027d pick out the men that looked old enough to be widowers, and shoot at them, and no others. In the last charge he got separated, and was by himself with a tall rebel with a gray beard. \u0027I surrender,\u0027 said the rebel. \u0027Are you a widower?\u0027 asked Elliott. \u0027I\u0027m sorry to say that my wife\u0027s dead,\u0027 said the rebel. \u0027Then you can\u0027t surrender. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to kill you,\u0027 said Elliott. But he\u0027d bin throwed off his guard by too much talkin\u0027. The rebel got the drop on him, and killed him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It ain\u0027t true that his girl went back on him before she heard he was killed,\" said the woman angrily, forgetting herself. \"She only married after the report of his death in the papers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jerusha,\" said Shorty, pulling out the letters and picture, rising to his feet, and assuming as well as he could in the rocking car the pose and manner of the indignant lovers he had seen in melodramas, \"I\u0027m Dan Elliott, and your own true love, whose heart you\u0027ve broke. When I learned of your faithlessness I sought death, but death went back on me. I\u0027ve come back from the grave to reproach you. You preferred the love of a second-hand husband, with a silver watch-chain and a raft o\u0027 logs, to that of an honest soldier who had no fortune but his patriotic heart and his Springfield rifle. But I\u0027ll not be cruel to you. There are the evidences of your faithlessness, that you was so anxious to git hold of. Your secret\u0027s safe in this true heart. Take \u0027em and be happy with your bridge-timber contractor. Be a lovin\u0027 wife to your warmed-over husband. Be proud of his speculations on the needs o\u0027 his country. As for me, I\u0027ll go agin to seek a soldier\u0027s grave, for I cannot forgit you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As he handed her the letters and picture he was dismayed to notice that the piece of Maria\u0027s dress was mixed in with them. He snatched it away, shoved it back in his pocket, pulled his hat down over his eyes, and, with a melodramatic air, rushed forward into the smoking-car, where he seated himself and at once fell asleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was awakened in the morning at Jeffersonville, by the provost-guard shaking him and demanding his pass. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63282.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
