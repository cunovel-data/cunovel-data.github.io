{"id":45158,"no":123,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. THE EVENING AFTER THE BATTLE.","content":"\"GREAT Jehosephat, how hungry I am,\" suddenly ejaculated Shorty, stopping his cheering, as the thunder of the guns died away into an occasional shot after the rebels galloping back to the distant woods on the ridge from which they had emerged. \"I must make some coffee. Wonder where I put my matches?\" \"Here, Pete,\" continued Shorty, as he broke off some splinters from the rails and started a little fire, \"take my canteen and Si\u0027s and yours, and run down there and find a spring, and fill \u0027em, before the others make a rush. Be spry about it, for there\u0027ll be a rush there in a minute, and you won\u0027t have no chance.\" The excited boy had to be spoken to a second time before he would come back to earth, much less comprehend the want of water and food. Like the rest of his companions, the terrific drama which had just been enacted had wrought him to a delirium, in which he could think of nothing but a world full of bellowing cannon, and a nightmare of careering, plunging horses, with savagely-yelling riders. They could not realize that the battlecloud had rolled away just as suddenly as it had burst upon them, and they stood there tightly grasping their reloaded guns, and staring fixedly into the distance for the next horrid development. \"I think you\u0027ll find a spring right over there where you see that bunch o\u0027 young willers, Pete,\" said Si, handing him his canteen. \"Break for it, before anybody else gets there and muddies the water.\" But Pete still stood rigid and unhearing, clutching his gun with a desperate grip, and glaring with bulging, unmoving eyes across the plain. \"Come, wake up, Pete,\" said Shorty, giving him a sharp shake. \"Do as I tell you, and on the jump. The fight\u0027s over.\" \"The fight\u0027s over?\" stammered the boy. \"Ain\u0027t they coming back again?\" \"Not on their butternut-dyed lives they ain\u0027t,\" said Shorty scornfully. \"They\u0027ve got their dirty hides as full o\u0027 lickin\u0027 as they kin hold for one day. They\u0027ll set around for a while, and rub their hurts, and try to think out jest how it all happened.\" \"Skip out, Pete,\" Si reminded the boy. \"The rest o\u0027 you boys stack your guns and foller Pete.\" \"Hadn\u0027t we batter take our guns along?\" suggested Monty, holding on to his with grim fearfulness. \"No. Stack \u0027em; stack \u0027em, I tell you,\" said Si impatiently. \"And be quick about it. They\u0027ll all git ahead o\u0027 you. Don\u0027t you see the rest stackin\u0027 arms?\" The boys obeyed as if dazed, and started to follow little Pete\u0027s lead toward the clump of willows. The boy, full of the old nick, found an Orderly\u0027s horse nipping the grass close by the path to the spring and, boy like, jumped on its back. The clatter of the canteens frightened the horse, and he broke into a dead run. Little Pete\u0027s Horse Bolts. 169 \"Do ye s\u0027pose the fight\u0027s really over?\" whispered Pete to Alf Russell, who was just behind him. \"Don\u0027t you think the rebels just let go to get a fresh hold?\" \"Seems so to me,\" answered Alf. \"Seems to me there was just millions of \u0027em, and we only got away with a little passel, in spite of all that shootin\u0027. Why, when we come out on the ridge the valley down there seemed fuller of \u0027em than it was at first.\" \"We oughtn\u0027t to get too far away from our guns,\" said Monty Scruggs. \"Them woods right over there may be full o\u0027 rebels watching to jump us when we get far enough away.\" \"I don\u0027t like the looks of that hill to the left,\" said Gid Mackall, nervously. \"An awful lot o\u0027 them went behind it, and I didn\u0027t see any come out.\" \"There, them bushes over there are shakingâ€”they\u0027re coming out again,\" said Harry Joslyn, turning to run back for his gun. \"No, not there,\" nervously interjected Humphrey\u0027s, turning with him; \"ain\u0027t there something stirring down there by the crick?\" \"No, no,\" said Sandy Baker, desperately. \"It\u0027s just that blame fool Pete. Come on! Come on! We\u0027ve got to. We were ordered to. Le\u0027s make a rush for it, like the men in the Indian stories done when they was sent for water.\" They acted on the suggestion with such vim that when Pete\u0027s horse tripped at the edge of the little run, and sent Pete over its head with a splash into the mud and water, the rest tumbled and piled on top of him. The men on the hill, who had noticed it, set up a yell of laughter, which scared the boys worse than ever, for they thought it meant the rebels were on them again. \"Now, what new conniption\u0027s struck them dumbed little colts?\" said Si, irritably, as he strode down to them, pulled them out, and set them on their feet, with a shaking and some strong words. \"Is the rebels coming again?\" gasped Pete, rubbing the mud and water out of his eyes. \"No, you little fool,\" said Si. \"The rebels ain\u0027t comin\u0027. They\u0027re goin\u0027 as fast as their horses kin carry \u0027em. They\u0027ve got through comin\u0027 for today. \"There ain\u0027t one of \u0027em within cannon-shot, and won\u0027t be till we go out and hunt \u0027em up again. You\u0027ve come near spilin\u0027 the spring with your tormented foolishness. What on earth possessed you to climb that boss? You need half killin\u0027, you do. Go up higher there and fill your canteens from where the water\u0027s clear. Be slow and careful, and don\u0027t rile the water. Say, I see some nice sassafras over there. I always drink sassafras tea this time o\u0027 year. It cleans the blood. I\u0027m goin\u0027 over and see if I can\u0027t git a good root while you\u0027re fillin\u0027 your canteens.\" Si walked out some distance in front of them, pulling as he walked some of the tender, fragrant, spicy young leaves of the sassafras, and chewing them with gusto. Arriving at the top of a rise he selected a young shrub, pulled it up, carefully loosed its root from the mulchy soil, and cut it off with his knife. His careless deliberation calmed the overwrought nerves of the boys, and when he returned they had their canteens filled, and walked back composedly to the fires, when they suddenly remembered that they were as hungry as Si and Shorty, and fell to work cooking their suppers. \"Is that the way with the rebel cavalry?\" asked Monty Scruggs, with his mouthful of crackers and meat. \"Do they come like a hurricane, and disappear again like an April shower?\" \"That\u0027s about it,\" answered Shorty disdainfully. \"That\u0027s the way with all cavalry, dad-burn \u0027em. They\u0027re like a passel o\u0027 fice pups. They\u0027re all yelp and bark, and howl and showin\u0027 o\u0027 teeth. They\u0027re jest goin\u0027 to tear you to pieces. But when you pick up a stone or a club, or git ready to give \u0027em a good kick they\u0027re gone, the devil knows where. They\u0027re only an aggravation. You never kin do nothin\u0027 with \u0027em, and they kin do nothin\u0027 with you. I never kin understand why God Almighty wasted his time in makin\u0027 cavalry of any kind, Yank or rebel. All our own cavalry\u0027s good for is to steal whisky and chickens from honest soldiers of the infantry. The infantry\u0027s the only thing. It\u0027s like the big dog that comes up without any special remarks, and sets his teeth in the other dog. The thing only ends when one dog or the other is badly whipped and somethin\u0027s bin accomplished.\" \"Will we have to fight them cavalry again tomorrow jest the same way?\" asked little Pete, still somewhat nervously. \"Lord only knows,\" answered Shorty indifferently, feeling around for his pipe. \"A feller never knows when he\u0027s goin\u0027 to have to fight rebel cavalry any more\u0027n he knows when he\u0027s goin\u0027 to have the toothache. The thing just happens, and that\u0027s all there is of it.\" Si and Shorty, having finished their suppers, lighted their pipes, and strolled up through the regiment to talk over with the others the events of the day and the probabilities of the morrow. Left alone, the tongues of the excited boys became loosened, and ran like the vibrations of a cicada\u0027s rattle. \"Wasn\u0027t it just wonderful?\" said Monty Scruggs. \"It looked as if a million circuses had suddenly let out over there. \"\u0027The Assyrians came down like a wolf on the fold, And their cohorts were gleaming with purple and gold.\u0027 \"Only there didn\u0027t seem much purple and gold about them. Seemed mostly brown rags and slouch hats and long swords. Gracious, did you ever see anything as long and wicked as them swords! Seemed that every one was pointing directly at me, and they\u0027d reach me the very next jump.\" \"Of course, you thought they were all looking at you,\" said Alf Russell. \"That\u0027s your idea, always, wherever you are. You think you\u0027re spouting on the platform, and the center of attraction. But I knew that they were all looking at me, as folks generally do.\" \"More self-conceit,\" sneered Harry Joslyn. \"Just because you\u0027re so good looking, Alf. I knew that they weren\u0027t bothering about any boy orator, who does most of his shooting with his mouth, nor any young pill-peddler, who sings in the choir, and goes home with the prettiest girl. They were making a dead set on the best shot in the crowd, the young feller who\u0027d come into the war for business, and told his folks at home before he started that he was going to shoot Jeff Davis with his own hand before he got back. That was me, I saw the Colonel of one o\u0027 the regiments point his sword straight at me as they came across the run, and tell his men to be sure and get me of all others.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you shoot him, if you\u0027re such a deadshot?\" asked Gid Mackall. \"Why, I was just loading my gun, when I saw him, and as I went to put on the cap you were shaking so that it jarred the cap out of my hand, and before I could get another, the smoke became so thick I couldn\u0027t see anything.\" \"I shaking?\" said Gib, with deep anger. \"Now, Harry Josynâ€”\" \"Come, boys; don\u0027t have a scrap, now,\" pleaded the serious-minded Alf. \"Just think how many dead men are lying around. It looks like raising a disturbance at a funeral.\" \"That\u0027s so,\" said Jake Humphreys. \"I don\u0027t think any of us is in shape to throw up anything to another about shaking. I own up that I was never so scared in all my life, and I feel now as if I ought to get down on my knees before everybody, and thank God Almighty that my life was spared. I ain\u0027t ashamed to say so.\" \"Bully for you, Jake,\" said Monty Scruggs, heartily. \"We all feel that way, but hain\u0027t the nerve to say so. I wish the Chaplain would come around and open a meeting of thanksgiving and prayer.\" \"I tell you what\u0027s the next best thing,\" suggested Jake Humphreys. \"Let Alf Russell sing one of those good old hymns they used to sing in the meetings back at home.\" \"Home!\" How many thousands of miles awayâ€”how many years of time awayâ€”seemed to those flushed, overwrought boys, bivouacking on the deadstrewn battlefield, the pleasant cornfields, the blooming orchards, the drowsy hum of bees, the dear homes, sheltering fathers, mothers, and sisters; the plain white churches, with their faithful, grayhaired pastors, of the fertile plains of Indiana. Alf Russell lifted up his clear, far-reaching boyish tenor, that they had heard a thousand times at devout gatherings, at joyful weddings, at sorrowing funerals, in that grandest and sweetest of hymns: \"All hail the power of Jesus\u0027 name; Let angels prostrate fall. Bring forth the royal-diadem. And crown Him Lord of All.\" As far as his voice could reach, the rough soldiers, officers and men, stopped to listen to himâ€”listened to him with emotions far too deep for the cheers that usually fly to the lips of soldiers at anything that stirs them. The higher officers quit talking of the plans of the morrow; the minor ones stopped, pen in hand, over their reports and requisitions; the busy Surgeons stayed their keen knives; the fussy Orderly-Sergeants quit bothering about rations and details; the men paused, looked up from their cards and cooking until the hymn was sung through. The voice was so pure, so fresh, so redolent of all that had graced and sweetened their far-off past, that it brought to each swarming emotions for which there was no tongue. \"Bully for you, Alf; you\u0027re a sweet singer in Israel,\" said Si, brushing away a suspicion of a tear. \"Spread out your blankets, boys, and lay down. Git all the sleep you kin, for there\u0027s lots o\u0027 work for us tomorrow. There goes tattoo!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63310.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
