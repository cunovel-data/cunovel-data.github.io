{"id":45121,"no":86,"title":"CHAPTER XX. STEWED CHICKEN","content":"THE DEACON\u0027S CULINARY OPERATIONS BRING HIM LOTS OF TROUBLE. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE Deacon reached the corn-crib again be fore daylight, and found Si and Shorty fast asleep. This relieved him much, for he had been disturbed with apprehensions of what might happen them while he was gone. Though he was more tired, it seemed to him, than he had ever been before in all his life, yet he nerved himself up to clean and cook one of the chickens, so as to give Si a delightful surprise when he awoke. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Deacon had grown so wise in the army ways that his first problem was how to hide the remaining four fowls until he should need them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027d simply be mobbed,\" he communed with him self, \"if daylight should come, and show me with four chickens in my possession. The whole Army o\u0027 the Cumberland \u0027d jump me as one man, and I\u0027d be lucky if I got away with my life. Mebbe even the General himself \u0027d send a regiment down to take the things away from me. But what kin I do with \u0027em? If I hang \u0027em up inside the corn-crib they\u0027ll spile. The weather is cold enough to keep \u0027em outside, but I\u0027d need a burglar-proof safe to hold on to \u0027em. It\u0027s just awful that morals are so bad in the army, and that men will take things that don\u0027t belong to \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He stopped short, for there arose the disturbing thought as to just how he himself had come into possession of the birds, and he murmured: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Tain\u0027t in me to blame \u0027em. What is \u0027t the Bible says about \u0027Let him who is without sin cast the first stone?\u0027 Certainly I\u0027m not the man to be heavin\u0027 dornicks just now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mindful of past experiences, he took the fowls in one hand, when he went down to the branch with a camp-kettle to get water. He washed his face and hands in the cold water, which revived him, and returning, built a fire and hung the kettle over it, while he carefully picked and cleaned one of the chickens for cooking. Then he plucked and cleaned the others, and burned the feathers and entrails in the fire. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Chicken feathers \u0027s mighty tell-tale things,\" he said to himself. \"I once knowed a man that was finally landed in the penitentiary because he didn\u0027t look out for chicken feathers. He\u0027d bin stealin\u0027 hosses, and was hidin\u0027 with them in the big swamp, where nobody would \u0027ve suspicioned he was, if he hadn\u0027t stole chickens from the neighborhood to live on, and left their feathers layin\u0027 around careless like, and some boys, who thought the foxes was killin\u0027 the chickens, followed up the trail and run onto him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then a bright idea occurred to him. He had a piece of board, which he laid on the stones that formed the foundation of one end of the crib, immediately under the flooring, and on this shelf he laid the other chickens. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I remember that Wash Jenkins that we arrested for counterfeitin\u0027 had hid his pile o\u0027 pewter dollars in the underpinnin\u0027 of his cabin, and we\u0027d never found any stuff to convict him, except by the merest accident. We hunted all through his cabin, below and in the loft, pulled the clapboards off, and dug up every likely place in the yard, and just about as we wuz givin\u0027 the whole thing up, somebody pulled a board out o\u0027 the underpinnin\u0027 to lay in the bed o\u0027 his wagon, and the bogus dollars run out. Wash made shoes for the State down at Jeffersonville for some years on account of that man wantin\u0027 a piece o\u0027 board for his wagon-bed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But the astute Deacon had overlooked one thing in his calculations. The crisp morning air was filled with the pungent smell of burning feathers and flesh, and the fragrance of stewing chicken. It reached hungry men in every direction, made their mouths water and their minds wonder where it could come from. \\n\\n \\n\\n First came a famished dog, sniffing and nosing around. His appearance filled the Deacon with alarm. Here was danger to his hidden stock that he had not thought of. He took his resolution at once. Decoying the cur near him he fastened a sinewy hand upon his neck, cut his throat with his jack-knife, and dragged the carcass some distance away from the corn-crib. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll git a mattock and shovel and bury it after awhile,\" he murmured to himself, as he returned and washed his hands. \"He\u0027s settled for good, any way. He won\u0027t be snoopin\u0027 around steal in\u0027 my chickens. I hope there hain\u0027t no more measly hounds around. Should\u0027ve thought they wuz all starved out long ago. My! but that chicken does smell so nice. How Si and Shorty will enjoy it. It\u0027ll build \u0027em right up. I\u0027d like awfully to take some of it myself, but they\u0027ll need every drop, poor fellows.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He got a spoon, and tested some of the broth appreciatively. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mother\u0027d done much better, at home in her own kitchen, or anywhere you could\u0027ve put her, than me with my clumsy ways,\" he continued, \"but she never cooked anything that\u0027ll taste better to them boys.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A negro cook appeared, with a tin cup in his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Afo\u0027 de Lawd, Boss, is hit you dat\u0027s cookin\u0027 dat chicking? I done smelled hit more\u0027n a miled away, and hab been huntin\u0027 foh hit all ober camp. Say, Boss, foh de Lawd\u0027s sake, jist gib me a little teenty, weenty sup in dis heah tin cup for my boss. He\u0027s an ossifer, an\u0027 is layin\u0027 in de ossifer\u0027s horsepitol ober dar. Hit\u0027ll do him a powerful sight ob good.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Awful Sorry, my friend,\" said the Deacon, hardening his heart, \"but I haven\u0027t a bit to spare. Hain\u0027t got as much as I need for my own son and his partner. I couldn\u0027t spare a mouthful for the General o\u0027 the army even. Let your Colonel or Major sendout men to git chickens for himself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My boss\u0027ll be powehful disappunted,\" said the negro, with his big, white eyes full of tears. \"He\u0027s powehful weak, foh sartin. A leetle sup ob broth\u0027d do him an everlastin\u0027 world ob good. He ain\u0027t no Kunnel or Majah. He\u0027s only a Cappen Cappen McGillicuddy, ob the 200th Injianny.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Capt. McGillicuddy, o\u0027 the 200th Injianny,\" said the Deacon, much moved. \"You Bay you\u0027re Capt. McGillicuddy\u0027s man?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, boss.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And he\u0027s layin\u0027 very low over in a tent there?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, boss. Got shot in de thigh in de battle, an\u0027 den had de feber. He\u0027s de very best man in de world, and I\u0027d do ennyt\u0027ing to help him. He\u0027s jest starvin\u0027 to def. I can\u0027t git nuffin\u0027 dat\u0027ll lay on his stummick, and stick to his ribs. I\u0027ve done ransacked de hull camp and de country clean up to Jineral Bragg\u0027s Headquartehs. De tings dat I couldn\u0027t git wuz eider chained down, or had a man wid a gun ober dem. Foh Gawd\u0027s sake, boss, jist gib me a half a cupful for him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s no man in the world I\u0027d rather help than Capt. McGillicuddy,\" said the Deacon. \"He\u0027s bin a mighty good friend to my son. I know that Si and Shorty\u0027d divide their last crumb with him. Look here, Sambo, if I give you a cupful o\u0027 this broth and a piece o\u0027 the meat, will you git down on your knees and swear you\u0027ll take every bit straight to him, and not take even a smidjin of it for your self?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"De Lawd be praised and magnified foreber, but I will,\" said the negro, dropping on his knees and holding up his hand. \"Swar me on a pile o\u0027 Bibles big as a haystack. I\u0027d radder go to hell on my knees backward dan tech de fust drap ob dat. I\u0027s too anxious to hab Cappen McGillicuddy git well, so I is. What\u0027d become ob dis pore niggeh if he should die? No, indeedy. Hope I\u0027ll drap dead in my tracks if I taste de least wee morssel.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to trust you,\" said the Deacon, stirring up the savory mess, ladling out a generous cupful, adding a drumstick, and covering the cup with a piece of paper. \"Now, carry it carefully. Every drop\u0027s worth its weight in gold.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Deacon looked a little regretful at the shrinking of the contents of the kettle, made by taking out the cupful, and said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mebbe I oughtn\u0027t \u0027ve done it. The boys need every spoonful. But if it\u0027d bin themselves, I know they\u0027d have given their Captain more\u0027n I did. He is twice blessed that giveth, and probably they\u0027ll git more somehow on account o\u0027 what I\u0027ve given away. But I mustn\u0027t give any more.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say, Mister,\" said a very feeble voice at his elbow, \"can\u0027t you give me a cupful o\u0027 that? It smells so good. It smells like home. I smelled it away over there in the tent, and it seemed to me that if I could get some of it I\u0027d certainly get well, though they all say they think there\u0027s no hope for me. I crawled out of the tent and come while the nurse was asleep and wasn\u0027t watching. They won\u0027t let me get upon my feet when they\u0027re watching me, but I fooled them this time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As he spoke, he sank down from sheer exhaustion, but still held out his cup imploringly, while an in tense longing filled his great, blue eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Deacon looked pityingly at him. His wan face was fair and delicate as a girl\u0027s, and even be fore disease had wasted him he had been very tall and slender. Now his uniform flapped around his shrunken body and limbs. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Deacon could not stand the appeal of those great, plaintive eyes and that wasted form. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The Lord blesses the giver,\" he said, taking the cup from the thin hand, and proceeding to fill it from the kettle. \"It may be that my own son will have the more from what I give this poor sick boy. It may be bread cast upon the waters. At any rate, I\u0027m goin\u0027 to take the chances. There\u0027s still enough left for one meal for Si and Shorty, and I\u0027ve four chickens left. After that the Lord\u0027ll provide. I\u0027ll do this in His name, and I\u0027ll trust Him. There, my boy, let the cup set on the ground till it cools, and then drink it, and here\u0027s a piece o\u0027 bread to go with it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The boy could scarcely wait for the cooling, and his swimming eyes expressed a gratitude that no words could convey. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here, pardner, I\u0027ll take a cupful o\u0027 that \u0027ere, too,\" said a frazzled and frowsy teamster, shambling up through the half-light of the dawn. \"I smelled it, and follered my nose till it brung me here. My, but it smells good! Jest fill my cup, and I\u0027ll do as much for you some time when you\u0027re hungry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go away, Groundhog,\" said the Deacon, recognizing him. \"I\u0027ve only got a little here for Si and Shorty. I hain\u0027t a spoonful left for myself, and none to give away. Go and get your own chickens, and bile \u0027em yourself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can\u0027t have any, eh?\" said Groundhog, swagger ing up. \"We\u0027ll see about that, old man. I watched you givin\u0027 away to that nigger, and this little dead-beat here, but you hain\u0027t none to give me, who is doin\u0027 hard work for the army, and helpin\u0027 keep \u0027em from starvin\u0027. If you\u0027ve got enough for that nigger and that whinin\u0027 boy you\u0027ve got enough for me, and I\u0027m goin\u0027 to have it, for I need it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re not goin\u0027 to have a dumbed spoonful, Groundhog. Go away. I hain\u0027t enough for Si and Shorty, I tell you. Go away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I tell you I need it more\u0027n they do, for I\u0027m workin\u0027 for the whole army, while they\u0027re layin\u0027 around, makin\u0027 out they\u0027re sick. You give me a cupful o\u0027 that and I\u0027ll go away and make no trouble. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you don\u0027t I\u0027ll kick the whole kettle over. An old fool citizen like you \u0027s got no business in camp, any way, and no right to be havin\u0027 things that ought to go to the laborin\u0027 men.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And he raised his foot threateningly. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Deacon laid down the spoon with which he had been stirring the broth, and doubling up his mighty fist, placed himself between Groundhog and the kettle, and said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027if You Don\u0027t Skip out O\u0027 Here This Minute I\u0027ll Bust Your Head As I Would a Punkin.\u0027 264 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Groundhog, I\u0027m an old man, and always have bin a man o\u0027 peace. I don\u0027t believe in no kind o\u0027 fightin\u0027, nor molestin\u0027 no one. I belong to church, and \u0027ve always tried to lead a Christian life. But if you don\u0027t skip out o\u0027 here this minute, I\u0027ll bust your head as I would a punkin.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Groundhog retreated a few steps, but still kept up a show of determination. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are you foolin\u0027 with the ole hayseed for?\" said another teamster, coming up behind Groundhog. \"Slap the old hawbuck over, snatch up the kittle and run with it. I\u0027ll do it if you don\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go for \u0027em, Deacon; I\u0027m with you. We kin lick both of \u0027em,\" shouted Shorty, who had been awakened by the noise of the dispute, and came tottering out, trying to raise a stick of wood for a club. \\n\\n \\n\\n At that moment a rebel cannon roared on Lookout Mountain, just over them, and the wicked screech of a shell cleft the air. Both of the team sters dropped on the ground in a paralysis of fear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The rebels \u0027ve got a new battery planted on the mountain,\" said Shorty, turning to study the smoke that drifted away, in order to get its location. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The shell struck right over there, and hain\u0027t bursted yet,\" said the sick boy, looking up from sipping his broth, and pointing to a spot a short distance away. \"I can hear the hissing of the fuse.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The teamsters sprang up like jacks-in-the-box, and ran with all the power of their legs. By the time the explosion came they were hundreds of yards away. \\n\\n \\n\\n A column of dirt and stones was thrown up, of which a little sprinkle reached the fire. Thousands of voices yelled derisively at the rebel gunner. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027re shootin\u0027 wuss and wuss every day,\" remarked Shorty, after judicially considering the shot and making comparison with its predecessors. \"They\u0027ll git so after awhile that they can\u0027t hit the Tennessee Valley.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shorty,\" said the Deacon, \"take this revolver and watch that kittle while I wash Si\u0027s face, and git him ready for his breakfast. If you let anybody git away with it you lose your breakfast. If I ever go into restaurantin\u0027 for a bizniss, I\u0027m goin\u0027 to find a quieter neighborhood than Chattanoogy. I ain\u0027t exactly grumblin\u0027, so to speak, but there\u0027s enough excitement before breakfast every mornin\u0027 to last me a full year.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63273.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
