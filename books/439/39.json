DEACON KLEGG\u0027S ARRIVAL IS MISTAKEN","content":"FOR A KNIGHT OF THE GOLDEN CIRCLE. \"THINGS don\u0027t look so tumultuous-like on this train,\" said Mr. Klegg, with a sigh of satisfaction, as he seated himself in the car for Murfreesboro\u0027 and deposited his valuables by his side. \"I know that boys will be boys, and I like to see them have fun just as well as any other man, but I must say that they made things on that other train a little too lively for a middle-aged Deacon of the Baptist Church.\" A broad-shouldered Provost-Sergeant walked through the car, with an air of authority, and gave orders to several who were seated in it. \"Must be the Constable, or Sheriff, or Town Marshal,\" mused Mr. Klegg. \"I hope he\u0027ll stay on the train till we reach Murfreesboro\u0027, and keep order.\" Mr. Klegg was right. The irregularities and disorders of the \"rear\" ended at Nashville. There the strict discipline of the \"front\" began under the iron sway of the Provost-Marshal, whose guards were everywhere, particularly at the depots and on the cars. The occupants of the car were as orderly as the boys at a country school when the master is on his throne, with his eyes about him. It was a bright day, and the country roundabout176 of surpassing interest to the Indiana farmer. He saw the domed, stately capitol of Tennessee crowning the highest hill, and lording a glorious landscape of hill and valley, through which the Cumberland River flowed in majestic sweeps, like a broad girdle of sparkling silver. Then came the frowning forts, with beetling banks of blood-red clay, with terror-striking black guns, with rugged palisades, and a porcupine bristle of abatis. Sentries with gleaming muskets paced their high parapets. Every mile, as far as he could see, was full of objects of engrossing interest. He became so absorbed in the feast of his eyes that he did not observe that a middle-aged, clean shaven man in a suit of dusty black had sat down beside him, and was studying him with attention. \"How do you do, my friend?\" said he at length, putting out his hand. Mr. Klegg turned with a start, and instinctively put out his hand. \"Howdy,\" he said, with a tone of little encouragement, for he would much rather have continued watching the country than indulge in purposeless conversation. The stranger grasped his hand warmly, and pressed his thumb upon the first joint of Mr. Klegg\u0027s, and caught his little finger in a peculiar way. Deacon Klegg had been initiated into the Odd Fellows, and he dimly recognized this as a \"grip,\" but he could not associate it for the moment with any of the degrees of the brotherhood of the Three blinks. \"Were you out late last night,\" said the stranger in a low, deeply-impressive tone.177 \"Not pertickerlerly,\" answered Deacon Klegg, turning to catch a view of the stockade at La Vergne, where the 1st Mich. Eng. had made such a gallant defense. \"I\u0027d a mighty bothersome day, and was purty well tuckered out. I found a good place to sleep, and I turned in rather airly. Say,\" continued he, pointing to the wreckage of battle, \"the boys seem to have poked it to \u0027em purty lively out there.\" \"It was a very sharp fight,\" returned the other; \"but for once our friend Wheeler made a mistake, and lost heavily. Down the road farther you\u0027ll see evidences of his more successful work in some miles of burnt wagons.\" \"Bad man, that Gen. Wheeler,\" said the Deacon, looking steadfastly out of the window. The stranger looked a little disappointed, but he rallied, and presently gave the second grand hailing sign of the Knights of the Golden Circle, in the same low, impressive tone: \"Did you see a star last night?\" \"Can\u0027t say that I did,\" responded Mr. Klegg rather indifferently. \"There was lots of gas-lamps burning, and I was rather taken with them, so that I didn\u0027t notice the moon or stars. Besides, as I told you before, I turned in purty airly, for I was tired with my ride from Looyville, and I wanted to git in good shape for the trip to-day.\" A cloud of annoyance came upon the stranger\u0027s face, and he did not speak again for a minute or two. Then he said: \"You are from Indiana, are you not?\" \"Yes,\" said Mr. Klegg. \"From Posey County?\"178 \"Yes.\" \"I knew so. I\u0027ve been looking for you for several days.\" \"Looking for me?\" said Deacon Klegg, turning around in amazement. \"How come you to be lookin\u0027 for me? What business have you got with me? How\u0027d you know I was a-comin\u0027? Nobody knowed it outside o\u0027 Mariar, my wife, and my family.\"179 Deacon Klegg and the Knight of The Golden Circle. \"Come, come, now,\" said the other impatiently. \"Don\u0027t try to play off on me. You needn\u0027t be afraid. I\u0027m all right. I\u0027m Deputy Grand Organizer for the Knights for Southern Indiana and the jurisdiction of Louisville generally. You ought to remember me. I recollect you perfectly. I organized the Lodges in Poseyville, and all through your County. I planted the seed there for a big crop of Butternuts that\u0027ll help hurl the tyrant Lincoln from his bloody throne, and give the country back into the hands of the white man. I got word that you were coming down with important information from your section for Gen. Bragg and John Morgan, and I\u0027ve been on the lookout for you.\" An understanding of what the man was, and what he was driving at, began to slowly filter into Deacon Klegg\u0027s mind, and his temper to rise. \"Confound you, you pizen Copperhead,\" he said wrathfully. \"What do you take me for? Do you take me for a miserable, traitorous Knight o\u0027 the Golden Circle? I\u0027m a member o\u0027 the church, or I\u0027d punch your pizen head. I\u0027m a loyal man, and I\u0027ve got a son fightin\u0027 for the union.\" \"H-u-s-h,\" said the unconvinced man, laying his hand on the Deacon\u0027s arm. \"Don\u0027t talk so loud. They\u0027re watching us.\" Klegg shook his hand off angrily, but the warning came too late. The Provost-Sergeant had been watching them, at the instigation of a sharp-eyed, clerkly-looking man in semi-uniform. The Sergeant strode toward them, followed by a soldier with a gun. \"I arrest you both,\" said he. \"You are men that180 we\u0027ve been looking for. You\u0027ll stay right there in your seats till we get to Murfreesboro\u0027, and this man \u0027ll see that you do.\" The soldier took position at the end of the seat, and dropped the end of his musket on the floor with an I\u0027ve-got-my-orders-an\u0027-I\u0027m-going-to- stay-right-here look on his face. \"You\u0027ve been lookin\u0027 for me,\" gasped Deacon Klegg. \"Who else\u0027s been lookin\u0027 for me, I\u0027d like to know? Is the whole State o\u0027 Tennessee lookin\u0027 for me? What was you lookin\u0027 for me for? Think I\u0027ve run away from Injianny without pay in\u0027 my debts? Think I want to desert my wife and children? Young man, you don\u0027t know Josiah Klegg. I\u0027ve got a quarter section of as good land as there is in the Wabash bottoms, and I don\u0027t owe a dollar on it. As for leavin\u0027 Maria Klegg, I wouldn\u0027t do it for the whole State of Injianny. What\u0027ve you been lookin\u0027 for me for, I\u0027d like to know?\" \"Old man, I haven\u0027t time to talk to you, and it ain\u0027t my business. You\u0027ll find out soon enough, when you git to headquarters, and so will your partner there.\" \"My partner,\" echoed Deacon Klegg. \"This man\u0027s no partner o\u0027 mine. I never laid eyes on him till a half-hour ago.\" \"Continue your speech at headquarters,\" said the Sergeant, as he moved off. \"I haven\u0027t time to listen to it now. You\u0027d better save your breath till then, for you\u0027ll have to do some mighty slick talkin\u0027 to save your spying neck, I can tell you that.\" Deacon Klegg sank back in the seat dumfounded. \"What on airth kin he mean?\" he gasped.181 \"It\u0027s another of the outrages of the despot Lincoln,\" answered his companion. \"It\u0027s another of the arbitrary arrests by his military satraps. Liberty is dead in this country until we can overthrow that nigger-loving usurper.\" \"Shut up,\" said the Deacon savagely. \"If you say another word I\u0027ll mash you. I won\u0027t be disturbed when I\u0027m tryin\u0027 to think things out.\" \"I want that carpetsack and umbrella of yours,\" said the Sergeant, coming back. \"I\u0027ve no doubt you\u0027ve got \u0027em both full of treasonable documents and information for your rebel friends. Guard, watch both these men closely, and see that they don\u0027t destroy any papers, nor throw anything out the window.\" \"Young man,\" said the Deacon resolutely, \"you can\u0027t have that carpetsack or that umbreller. They\u0027re my property. If you tech \u0027em I\u0027ll have the law on you. I\u0027ll sue you for trespass, larceny, assault and battery, and intent to provoke. I hain\u0027t done nothin\u0027 to justify it. I\u0027m Josiah Klegg, of Posey County, Injianny, Deacon in the Ebenezer Church, on Mill Crick. I\u0027m goin\u0027 down to Murfreesboro\u0027 to visit my son, Josiah Klegg, jr., o\u0027 the 200th Injianny Volunteers. You all know him. He\u0027s an officer; he\u0027s the boy that tried to git a commissary wagon away from the rebels durin\u0027 the battle, and he and Shorty \u0027ve got a house with a tin roof.\" The other occupants gathered around and laughed derisively. \"Twon\u0027t do, old man,\" said the Sergeant, trying to wrest the carpetsack away. \"You tell a pretty story, and you\u0027re well disguised, but we\u0027re onto you.182 We got full particulars about you from Louisville. You\u0027re a bad lot down there in Posey County. There\u0027s a Knights of the Golden Circle Lodge under every sycamore. You\u0027d be at Gen. Bragg\u0027s headquarters to-morrow night if we let you alone.\" He pulled hard at the carpetsack, and Deacon Klegg resisted with all his sturdy might. His strength was quite a match for the Sergeant\u0027s, but other soldiers came to help the latter. The handles came off in the struggle, and the Deacon was forced down into his seat. The other man took advantage of the confusion to work his way through the crowd to the door and jump off. This angered the Sergeant, and coming back to where Mr. Klegg sat, exhausted and intensely mad, he said: \"I\u0027ll make sure that you don\u0027t get away, anyhow. I ought to\u0027ve done this at first.\" So saying, he snapped a hand-cuff over Mr. Klegg\u0027s wrist and then over the arm of the seat. The Deacon was never so humiliated in his life. He was simply speechless in his rage and mortification. Among the many of Gen. Rosecrans\u0027s eccentricities and vagrant fancies was one for prowling around through his camps at night, wearing a private\u0027s overcoat and cap. One night he strolled into the camp of the 200th Ind. The superior architecture of Si and Shorty\u0027s cabin struck him, and he decided to look inside. He knocked on the door. \"Come in,\" shouted Si.183 He entered, and found Si engaged with Tom Billings in a game of checkers for the championship of the 200th Ind. Shorty was watching the game intently, as Si\u0027s counselor, and Zeke Tomkins was giving like assistance to Tom Billings. Two other crack players were acting as umpires. The light from the fire shone brightly upon them, but left the front of the room, where the General stood, in complete darkness. They were so absorbed in the game that they merely looked up, saw that the newcomer was a private soldier, and supposed that he had merely dropped in to watch the game. \"Did you clean your feet on the bayonet outside the door?\" demanded Shorty, as he fixed his eyes again on the red and white grains of corn, which represented the men on the board. \"No, I forgot,\" said the General quietly. \"Well, go right outside and clean \u0027em off,\" ordered Shorty. \"Don\u0027t want no mud tracked in here for us to carry out agin.\" The General, much amused, went out, carefully scraped his boots, and then returned. \"All right,\" said Shorty, looking up as he reentered. \"Now look all you like, but don\u0027t say nothin\u0027. Nobody s allowed to say a word but the players and the umpires.\" The game proceeded in silence for several minutes, and the General became much interested. It was one of his peculiarities that he could not help getting interested in anything that his soldiers were doing, from the boiling of a cup of coffee or the pitching of a tent to the alignment of a company. Si was getting a little the better of Billings, and184 the General\u0027s sympathies naturally went toward the loser. He touched Billings on the shoulder, as he was about to make a move, and said: The General Interrupts the Game 184 \"Don\u0027t do that. You\u0027ll open your king row. \"Move—\" Shorty was alert on the instant. \"Shut up,\" he commanded. \"You\u0027ve no business talkin\u0027; I told you when you come in you weren\u0027t allowed to say nothin\u0027.\" \"Excuse me,\" said the General; \"I quite forgot.\" \"Well, see that you don\u0027t forgit agin,\" growled Shorty. \"We\u0027ve got quite enough talent in the game already. We don\u0027t want no more to come in.\" Again the game proceeded in intent silence for some minutes. Then Si called out: \"Hold on; you can\u0027t jump backwards with that man. That ain\u0027t no king.\" \"I say it is a king,\" said Billings. \"I got him into the row half an hour ago, and crowned him. You knocked the crown off when you moved.\" \"I know better,\" said Shorty. \"I\u0027ve been watching that piece right along, and he\u0027s never been nearer the king-row than he is this minute.\" A hot discussion ensued. The General forgot him self and joined in in his usual positive, authoritative way. \"I say the man had been crowned. I saw him crowned and the crown afterward knocked off. There\u0027s the crown by the side there.\" Shorty\u0027s wrath rose. \"I told you when you come in here,\" he said sharply, \"not to mix into this game. You\u0027ve got no business in it. Keep your advice till it\u0027s asked for, or git out o\u0027 the tent. If you don\u0027t git out I\u0027ll put you out.\" \"Be careful, my man,\" said the General, speaking in his usual way. \"You are talking to an officer.\" \"I don\u0027t care if you are a Lieutenant or a Captain, even,\" Si chimed in; \"you have no business mixing in a quiet little game o\u0027 checkers between186 enlisted men.\" \"I am more than a Captain,\" said the General, opening his overcoat slightly, to show his double dow of buttons. \"Dern\u0027 a Major or a Colonel don\u0027t make it much better,\" said Si, obdurately, but with much more respect. \"I\u0027m higher than a Colonel,\" said the General, amusedly, and opening his overcoat a little farther. \"Excuse us, General,\" they all murmured, rising to their feet, and taking the position of a soldier. \"You don\u0027t command our brigade, do you?\" said Shorty, trying to get a better view of his face. \"I command this brigade, and several others,\" said the General, smilingly enjoying their confusion. \"Lord, a Major-General commanding a corps,\" gasped Shorty, backing up with the rest into line, and saluting with the profoundest respect. \"Still higher,\" laughed the General, stepping for ward to where the light fell full on his face. \"I\u0027m Maj.-Gen. Rosecrans, commanding this army. But don\u0027t be disturbed. You\u0027ve done nothing. You are all entitled to your opinions, as free American citizens; but I will insist that that man had been in the king row, and should be crowned. But you settle that among yourselves. \"I merely dropped in to compliment you on the skill you have shown in building your house and its comfort. I\u0027m glad to find that it looks even better inside than out. I know that you are good soldiers from the way you take care of yourselves. But so fine a house ought to have a better checker-board than a barrel-head, with grains of corn for men. Who are the owners of the house?\"187 \"Me and him,\" said Shorty, indicating himself and Si. \"Very good,\" said the General; \"both of you report at my Headquarters to-morrow morning at 10 o\u0027clock. Good night.\" \"Three cheers and a tiger for Old Rosey,\" yelled Shorty as soon as he could get his scattered wits together enough to say a word. They gave three such rousing cheers that the rest of Co. Q came running out of their tents, and joined in cheering, as fast as the news could be communicated to them. The next morning a squad of prisoners was being conducted toward Army Headquarters. At their head walked a stout, middle-aged farmer, carrying a portly blue umbrella. He had spent the night among the riotous spirits in the guard-house, and had evidently undergone much wear and tear. He looked as if things had not been going his way at all. By him marched the stalwart Provost-Sergeant, with a heavy striped carpetsack under his arm. Gen. Rosecrans rode up at the head of his staff, from an early morning inspection of some part of the camp. The men saluted and cheered. \"Whom have you here, Sergeant?\" said the General, reining up his horse beside the squad. \"That\u0027s Gen. Rosecrans,\" said one of the guards to Deacon Klegg. \"Nobody of importance,\" replied the Sergeant, \"except this old man here. He\u0027s a Knight of the188 Golden Circle, that we\u0027ve been watching for for some time, going through with information and other things from the Knights of Indiana to the enemy in Tullahoma. I\u0027ve got his carpetsack here. I expect it\u0027s full of papers and contraband stuff. It feels as if it had lead in it. I am taking him to the Provost-Marshal\u0027s for examination.\" He set the heavy carpetsack down on the ground, to rest for a minute. \"Gen. Rosecrans, it\u0027s all a plaguey lie,\" burst out Deacon Klegg. \"I\u0027m as loyal a man as there is in the State of Injianny. I voted for Abe Lincoln and Oliver P. Morton. I\u0027ve come down here to visit my son, Josiah Klegg, jr., of the 200th Injianny Volunteers. You know him, General. He\u0027s one o\u0027 your officers. He\u0027s a Corporal. He\u0027s the boy that tried to take a commissary wagon away from the rebels durin\u0027 the battle, and he\u0027s got a house with a tin roof. You recollect that, don\u0027t you?\" Some of the staff laughed loudly, but the General checked them with a look, and spoke encouragingly to the Deacon. \"Yes, General,\" continued Mr. Klegg, \"I knowed you\u0027d know all about him the minit I mentioned him to you. I told this over and over agin to these plaguey fools, but they wouldn\u0027t believe me. As to that carpetsack havin\u0027 things for the enemy, it\u0027s the biggest lie that ever was told. I\u0027ll open it right here before you to show you. I\u0027ve only got some things that my wife and the girls was sendin to Si.\" He fumbled around for his keys. \"Possibly you have made a mistake, Sergeant,\" said the General. \"What evidence have you?\"189 \"We\u0027d got word to look out for just such a man, who\u0027d play off the dodge of being an old plug of a farmer on a visit to his son.\" Meeting Between si and his Father. 189 \"He was on the train with a man whom all the detectives know as one of the worst Knights in the gang. They were talking together all the way. I190 arrested the other one, too, but he slipped away in the row this man made to distract our attention.\" In the meantime Deacon Klegg had gotten his carpetsack open for the General\u0027s inspection. It was a sorry sight inside. Butter, honey, shirts, socks, boots, and cakes are excellent things taken separately, but make a bad mixture. Deacon Klegg looked very dejected. The rest grinned broadly. \"I don\u0027t seem to see anything treasonable so far,\" said the General. \"Sergeant, take the rest of your prisoners up to the Provost-Marshal, and leave this man with me.\" \"Gen. Rosecrans,\" said a familiar voice, \"you ordered us to report to you this mornin\u0027 at 10 o\u0027clock. We\u0027re here.\" The General looked up and saw Corporal Si Klegg and Shorty standing at a \"salute.\" \"Si!\" said the Deacon, joyously, sticking out a hand badly smeared with honey and butter. \"Pap!\" shouted the Corporal, taking the hand in rapture. \"How in the world did you git down here?\" They all laughed now, and the General did not check them. \"Corporal,\" said he, \"I turn this man over to you. I\u0027ll hold you responsible that he don\u0027t communicate with the enemy. But come on up to Headquarters and get your checker-board. I have a very nice one for you.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63226.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
