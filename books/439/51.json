ROSENBAUM became a frequent visitor to the Hoosier\u0027s Rest, and generally greatly interested Si and Shorty with his stories of adventure. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did you happen to come into the Army of the Cumberland?\" asked Si. \"I\u0027d a-thought you\u0027d staid where you knowed the country and the people.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That was just the trouble,\" replied Rosenbaum. \"I got to know them very well, but they got to know me a confounded sight better. When I was in the clothing pizniss in St. Louis I tried to have everybody know me. I advertised. I wanted to be a great big sunflower that everybody noticed. But when I got to be a spy I wanted to be a modest little violet that hid under the leaves, unt nobody saw. Then every man what knew me become a danger, unt it got so that I shuddered every time that I see a limb running out from a tree, for I didn\u0027t know how soon I might be hung from it. I had some awful narrow escapes, I tell you. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But what decided me to leave the country unt skip over de Mississippi River was something that happened down in the Boston Mountains just before the battle of Pea Ridge. I was down there watching Van Dorn unt Ben McCullough for General Curtis, unt54 was getting along all right. I was still playing the old racket about buying up Mexican silver dollars to buy ammunition. One night I was sitting at a campfire with two or three others, when a crowd of Texans come up. They was just drunk enough to be devilish, unt had a rope with a noose on the end, which I noticed first thing. I had begun to keep a sharp lookout for such things. My flesh creeped when I saw them. I tried to think what had stirred them up all at once, but couldn\u0027t for my life recollect, for everything had been going on all right for several days. The man with the rope—a big, ugly brute, with red hair unt one eye—says: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027You\u0027re a Jew, ain\u0027t you?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Yes,\u0027 says I; \u0027I was born that way.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Well,\u0027 says he, \u0027we\u0027re going to hang you right off.\u0027 Unt he put the noose around my neck unt began trying to throw the other end over a limb.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Close Call for Rosenbaum. 54 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027What for?\u0027 I yelled, trying to pull the rope off my neck. \u0027I ain\u0027t done nothing.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Hain\u0027t eh?\u0027 said the man with one eye. \u0027You hook-nosed Jews crucified our Savior.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Why, you red-headed fool,\u0027 said I, catching hold of the rope with both hands, \u0027that happened more as 1,800 years ago. Let me go.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I don\u0027t care if it did,\u0027 said the one-eyed man, getting the end of the rope over the limb, \u0027we didn\u0027t hear about it till the Chaplain told us this morning, unt then the boys said we\u0027d kill every Jew we come across. Catch hold of the end here, Bowers.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The other fellers around me laughed at the Texans so that they finally agreed to let me go if I\u0027d promise not to do it again, holler for Jeff Davis, unt treat all around. It was a fool thing, but it scared me worse\u0027n anything else, unt I resolved to get out of there unt go where the people read their Bibles unt the newspapers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did you manage to keep Gen. Curtis posted as to the number of rebels in front of him?\" asked Si. \"You couldn\u0027t always be running back and forth from one army to the other.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, that was easy enough. You see. General56 Curtis was advancing, unt the rebels falling back most of the time. There was cabins every little ways along the road. All these have great big fireplaces, built of smooth rocks, which they pick up out of the creek unt wherever they can find them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027d go into these houses unt talk with the people unt play with the children. I\u0027d sit by the fire unt pick up a dead coal unt mark on these smooth rocks. Sometimes I\u0027d draw horses unt wagons unt men to amuse the children. Sometimes I\u0027d talk to the old folks about how long they\u0027d been in the country, how many bears unt deers the man had killed, how far it was to the next place, how the roads run, unt so on, unt I\u0027d make marks on the jam of the fireplace to help me understand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The next day our scouts would come in unt see the marks unt understand them just as well as if I\u0027d wrote them a letter. I fixed it all up with them before I left camp. I kin draw very well with a piece of charcoal. I\u0027d make pictures of men what would make the children unt old folks open their eyes. Our scouts would understand which one meant Ben McCullough, which one Van Dorn, which one Pap Price, unt so on. Other marks would show which way each one was going unt how many men he hat with him. The rebels never dropt on to it, but they came so close to it once or twice that my hair stood on end.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That curly mop of yours\u0027d have a time standing on end,\" ventured Shorty. \"I should think it\u0027d twist your neck off tryin\u0027 to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, something gave me a queer feeling about the throat one day when I saw a rebel Colonel stop57 unt look very hard at a long letter which I\u0027d wrote this way on a rock. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Who done that?\u0027 he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027This man here,\u0027 says the old woman, \u0027He done it while he was gassing with the old man unt fooling with the children. Lot o\u0027 pesky nonsense, marking up de walls dat a-way.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Looks like very systematic nonsense,\u0027 said the Colonel very stern unt sour. \u0027There may be something in it. Did you do this?\u0027 said he, turning to me. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 said I, \u0027I have a bad habit of marking when I\u0027m talking. I always done it, even when I was a child. My mother used to often slap me for spoiling the walls, but she could never break me of it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Humph,\u0027 said he, not at all satisfied with my story, unt looking at the scratches harder than ever. \u0027Who are you, unt what are you doing here?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I told him my story about buying Mexican silver dollars, unt showed him a lot of the dollars I\u0027d bought. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Your story ain\u0027t reasonable,\u0027 said he. \u0027You haven\u0027t done bizniss enough to pay you for all the time you\u0027ve spent around the army. I\u0027ll put you under guard till I can look into your case.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He called to the Sergeant of the Guard, unt ordered him to take charge of me. The Sergeant was that same dirty loafer. Bob Smiles, that I had the trouble with by Wilson\u0027s Creek. He kicked me unt pounded me, unt put me on my horse, with my hands tied behind me, unt my feet tied under the horse\u0027s belly. I was almost dead by night, when we reached Headquarters. They gave me something to58 eat, unt I laid down on the floor of the cabin, wishing I was Pontius Pilate, so that I could crucify every man in the Southern Confedrisy, especially Bob Smiles. An hour or two later I heard Bob Smiles swearing again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Spy in Custody. 58 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Make out the names of all the prisoners I have,\u0027 he was saying, \u0027with where they belong unt the charges against them. I can\u0027t. Do they take me for a counter-jumping clerk? I didn\u0027t come into the army to be a white-faced bookkeeper, I sprained59 my thumb the other day, unt I can\u0027t write even a Httle bit. What am I to do?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That was all moonshine about his spraining his thumb. He vas ignorant as a jackass. If he had 40 thumbs he couldn\u0027t write even his own name so\u0027s anybody could read it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027I don\u0027t believe these\u0027s a man in a mile of here that can make out such a list,\u0027 he went on. They\u0027re all a set of hominy-eating blockheads. Perhaps that hook-nosed Jew might. He\u0027s the man. I\u0027ll make him do it, or break his swindling head.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He come in, kicked me, unt made me get up, unt then took me out unt set me down at a table, where he had paper, pen unt ink, unt ordered me to take down the names of the prisoners as he brought them up. He\u0027d look over my shoulder as I wrote, as if he was reading what I set down, but I knowed that he couldn\u0027t make out a letter. I was tempted to write all sorts of things about him, but I didn\u0027t, for I was in enough trouble already. When I come to my own name, he said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Make de charge a spy, a thief, unt a Dutch traitor to the Southern Confedrisy.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I just wrote: \u0027Levi Rosenbaum, Memphis, Tenn. Merchant. No charge.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He scowled very wisely at it, unt pretended to read it, unt said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027It\u0027s lucky for you that you wrote it just as I told you. I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 broke every bone in your body if you hadn\u0027t.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027d just got done when an officer come down from Headquarters for it. He looked it over unt said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Who made this out?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Why, I made it out,\u0027 said Bob Smiles, bold as brass. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027But who wrote it?\" said de officer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027O, I sprained my thumb, so I couldn\u0027t write very well, unt I made a Jew prisoner copy it,\u0027 said Bob Smiles. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027It\u0027s the best writing I have seen,\u0027 said the officer. \u0027I want the man what wrote it to go with me to Headquarters at once. I have some copying there to be done at once, unt not one of them corn-crackers that I have up there can write anything fit to read. Bring that man out here unt I will take him with me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bob Smiles hated to let me go, but he couldn\u0027t help himself, unt I went with the officer. I was so tired I could hardly move a step, unt I felt I could not write a word. But I seemed to see a chance at Headquarters, unt I determined to make every effort to do something. They gave me a stiff horn of whisky unt set me to work. They wanted me to make out unt copy a consolidated report of the army. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I almost forgot I was tired when I found out what they wanted, for I saw a chance to get something of great value. They\u0027d been trying to make up a report from all sorts of scraps unt sheets of paper sent in from the different Headquarters, unt they had spoiled a half-dozen big sheets of paper after they\u0027d got them partly done. If I do say it myself, I can write better and faster and figure quicker than most any man you ever saw. Those rebels thought they had got hold of a wonder—a61 lightning calculator unt lightning penman together. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As fast as I could copy one paper, unt it would prove to be all right, I would fold it up unt stick it into a big yaller envelope. I also folded up the spoiled reports, unt stuck them in the envelope, saying that I wanted to get rid of them—put them where seeing them wouldn\u0027t bother me. I carefully slipped the envelope under the edge of a pile of papers near the edge of the table. I had another big yaller envelope that looked just like it lying in the middle of the table, into which I stuck papers that didn\u0027t amount to nothing. I was very slick about it, unt didn\u0027t let them see that I had two envelopes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was past midnight when I got the consolidated report made out, unt the rebels was tickled to death with it. They\u0027d never seen anything so well done before. They wanted a copy made to keep, unt I said I\u0027d make one, though I was nearly dead for sleep. I really wasn\u0027t, for the excitement made me forget all about being tired. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was determined, before I slept, to have that yellow envelope, with all those papers, in General Curtis\u0027s hands, though he was 40 miles away. How in the world I was going to do it I could not think, but I was going to do it, if I died a trying. The first thing was to get that envelope off the table into my clothes; the next, to get out of that cabin, away from Bob Smiles unt his guards, through the rebel lines, unt over the mountains to General Curtis\u0027s camp. It was a dark, windy night, unt things were in confusion about the camp—just the kind of a time when62 anybody might kill a Jew pedler, unt no questions would be asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I had got the last copy finished, unt the officers was going over it. They had their heads together, not 18 inches from me, across the table. I had my fingers on the envelope, but I didn\u0027t dare slip it out, though my fingers itched. I was in hopes that they\u0027d turn around, or do something that\u0027d give me a chance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Suddenly Bob Smiles opened the door wide, unt walked in, with a dispatch in his hand. The wind swept in, blew the candles out, unt sent de papers flying about the room. Some went into the fire. The officers yelled unt swore at him, unt he shut the door, but I had the envelope in my breast-pocket. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then to get away. How in the name of Moses unt the ten commandments was I to do that? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One of the officers said to Bob Smiles: \u0027Take this man away unt take good care of him until to-morrow. We\u0027ll want him again. Give him a good bed, unt plenty to eat, unt treat him well. We\u0027ll need him to-morrow.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Come on, you pork-hating Jew,\u0027 said Bob Smiles crabbedly. \u0027I\u0027ll give you a mess of spare-ribs unt corn-dodgers for supper.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027You\u0027ll do nothing of the kind,\u0027 said the officer. \u0027I told you to treat him well, unt if you don\u0027t treat him well, I\u0027ll see about it. Give him a bed in that house where de orderlies stay.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bob Smiles grumbled unt swore at me, unt we vent out, but there was nothing to do but to obey orders. He give me a good place, unt some coffee unt bread, unt I lay down pretending to go to sleep.63 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I snored away like a good feller, unt presently I heard some one come in. I looked a little out the corner of my eye, unt see by the light of the fire that Bob Smiles was sneaking back. He watched me for a minute, unt then put his hand on me. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was scared as I never was, for I thought he vas after my precious yaller envelope. But I thought of my bowie knife, which I always carried out of sight in my bosom, unt resolved dat I vould stick it in his heart, if he tried to take away my papers. But I never moved. He felt over me until he come to de pocket where I had the silver dollars, unt then slipped his fingers in, unt pulled them out one by one, just as gently as if he vas smoothing the hair of a cat. I let him take them all, without moving a muscle. I was glad to haf him take them. I knowed that he was playing poker somewhere, unt had run out of cash, unt would take my money unt go back to his game. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As soon as I heard his footsteps disappear in the distance, I got up unt sneaked down to where the Headquarters horses were tied. I must get a fresh one, because my own vas played nearly out. He would never do to carry me over the rough roads I must ride before morning. But when I got there I saw a guard pacing up unt down in front of them. I had not counted on this, unt for a minit my heart stood still. There were no other horses anywheres around. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hesitated, looked up at Headquarters, unt saw de lights still burning, unt made up my mind at once to risk everything on one desperate chance. I remembered that I had put in my envelope some64 blank sheets of paper, with Headquarters, Army of the Frontier,\u0027 unt a rebel flag on dem. There was a big fire burning ofer to the right mit no one near. I went up in de shadow of a tree, where I could see by the firelight, took out one of the sheets of paper unt wrote on it an order to have a horse saddled for me at once. Then I slipped back so that it would look as if I was coming straight from Headquarters, unt walked up to the guard unt handed him the order. He couldn\u0027t read a word, but he recognized the heading on the paper, unt I told him the rest. He thought there was nothing for him to do but obey. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"While he was getting the horse I wrote out, by the fire, a pass for myself through the guards. I was in a hurry, you bet, unt it was all done mighty quick, unt I was on the horse\u0027s back unt started. I had lost all direction, but I knowed that I had to go generally to the northeast to get to General Curtis. But I got confused again, unt found I was riding around unt around the camp without getting out at all. I even come up again near the big fire, just where I wrote out the pass. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just then what should I hear but Bob Smiles\u0027s voice. He had lost all his money—all my money—at poker, unt was damning the fellers he had been playing with as cheats. He was not in a temper to meet, unt I knowed he would see me if I went by the big fire; but I was desperate, unt I stuck the spurs into my horse unt he shot ahead. I heard Bob Smiles yell: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027There is that Jew. Where is he going? Halt, there! Stop him!\u002765 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I knowed that if I stopped now I would be hung sure. The only safety was to go as fast as I could. I dashed away, where, I didn\u0027t know. Directly a guard halted me, but I showed him my pass, unt he let me go on. While he was looking at it I strained my ears, unt could hear horses galloping my way. I knowed it was Bob Smiles after me. My horse was a good one, unt I determined to get on the main road unt go as fast as I could. I could see by the campfires that I was now getting away from the army, unt I began to hope that I was going north. I kept my horse running. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pretty soon the pickets halted me, but I didn\u0027t stop to answer them. I just bolted ahead. The chances of their shooting me wasn\u0027t as dreadful as of Bob Smiles catching me. They fired at me, but I galloped right through them, unt through a rain of bullets that they sent after me. I felt better then, for I was confident I was out in the open country, but I kept my horse on the run. It seemed to me that I went a hundred miles. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just as the day was breaking in the east, I heard a voice, with a strong German accent call out the brush: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Halt! Who comes there?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Rosenbaum Runs Into Sigel\u0027s Pickets. 66 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was so glad that I almost fainted, for I knowed that I\u0027d reached General Sigel\u0027s pickets. I couldn\u0027t get my lips to answer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There came a lot of shots, unt one of them struck my horse in the head, unt he fell in the road, throwing me over his head. The pickets run out unt picked me up. The German language sounded the sweetest I ever heard it.66 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As soon as I could make myself talk, I answered them in German, unt told them who I was. Then they couldn\u0027t do enough for me. They helped me back to where they could get an ambulance, in which they sent me to Headquarters, for I was top weak to ride or walk a step. I handed my yellow envelope to General Curtis, got a dram of whisky to keep me up while I answered his questions, unt then went to67 sleep, unt slept through the whole battle of Pea Ridge. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"After the battle, General Curtis wanted to know how much he ought to pay me, but I told him that all I wanted was to serve the country, unt I was already paid many times over, by helping him win a victory. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I concluded that there was too much Bob Smiles in that country for me, unt I had better leave for some parts where I was not likely to meet him. So I crossed the Mississippi River, unt joined General Rosecrans\u0027s Headquarters.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63238.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
