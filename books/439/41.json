{"id":45076,"no":41,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. THE DEACON\u0027S INITIATION","content":"RAPIDLY ACQUIRES EXPERIENCE OF LIFE IN THE ARMY. SI ASKED questions of his father about the folks at home and the farm until the old gentleman\u0027s head ached, and he finally fell asleep through sheer exhaustion. The next day the Deacon took a comprehensive survey of the house, and was loud in his praises of Si and Shorty\u0027s architecture. \"Beats the cabin I had to take your mother to, Si, when I married her,\" he said with a retrospective look in his eye, \"though I\u0027d got up a sight better one than many o\u0027 the boys on the Wabash. Lays a way over the one that Abe Lincoln\u0027s father put up on Pigeon Crick, over in Spencer County, and where he brung the Widder Johnston when he married her. I remember it well. About the measliest shack there wuz in the country. Tom Lincoln, Abe\u0027s father, wuz about as lazy as you make \u0027em. They say nothin\u0027 will cure laziness in a man, but a second wife \u0027ll shake it up awfully. The Widder Johnston had lots o\u0027 git up in her, but she found Tom Lincoln a dead load. Abe wuz made o\u0027 different stuff.\" \"Yes,\" continued the father, growing reminiscential. \"There wuz no tin roof, sawed boards, glass winder nor plank floor in that little shack on the203 Wabash, but some o\u0027 the happiest days in my life wuz spent in it. Me and your mother wuz both young, both very much in love, both chock full o\u0027 hope and hard day\u0027s work. By the time you wuz born, Si, we\u0027d got the farm and the house in much better shape, but they wuz fur from being what they are to-day.\" \"If we only had a deed for a quarter section o\u0027 land around our house we\u0027d be purty well started in life for young men,\" ventured Si. \"I\u0027d want it a heap sight better land than this is \u0027round here,\" said the Deacon, studying the land scape judicially. \"Most of it that I\u0027ve seen so far is like self-righteousness the more a man has the worse he\u0027s off. Mebbe it\u0027ll raise white beans, but I don\u0027t know o\u0027 nothin\u0027 else, except niggers and poverty. The man that\u0027d stay \u0027round here, scratchin\u0027 these clay knobs, when there\u0027s no law agin him goin\u0027 to Injianny or Illinoy, hain\u0027t gumption enough to be anything but a rebel. That\u0027s my private opinion publicly expressed.\" \"Pap,\" said Si, after his father had been a day in camp, \"I think we\u0027ve done fairly well in providin\u0027 you with a house and a bed, but I\u0027m afeared that our cookin\u0027s not quite up to your taste. You see, you\u0027ve bin badly pampered by mother. I might say that she\u0027s forever spiled you for plain grub and common cookin\u0027.\" \"Your mother\u0027s the best cook that ever lived or breathed,\" said the Deacon earnestly. \"She kin make plain cornbread taste better than anybody else\u0027s pound cake. But you do well, Si, considerin\u0027 that your mother could never git you to do so much204 as help peel a mess o\u0027 \u0027taters. Your coffee\u0027d tan a side o\u0027 sole leather, and there\u0027s enough grease about your meat to float a skiff; but I didn\u0027t expect to live at a hotel when I come down here.\" The Deacon strolled down near Regimental Headquarters. An Aid came up and, saluting the Colonel, said: \"Colonel, the General presents his compliments, and instructs me to say that he has received orders from Division Headquarters to send details of a Corporal and five men from each regiment there to morrow morning at 7 o\u0027clock for fatigue duty. You will furnish yours.\" \"Very good,\" answered the Colonel, returning the salute. \"Adjutant, order the detail.\" \"Sergeant-Major,\" said the Adjutant, after a momentary glance at his roster, \"send an order to Capt, McGillicuddy, of Co. Q, for a Corporal and five men for fatigue duty, to report at Division Headquarters at 7 to-morrow morning.\" The Deacon walked toward Co. Q\u0027s quarters, and presently saw the Orderly hand the Captain the order from the Colonel. \"Orderly-Sergeant,\" said the Captain, \"detail a Corporal and five men to report for fatigue duty at Division Headquarters to-morrow at 7 o\u0027clock.\" The Orderly-Sergeant looked over his roster, and then walked down to Si\u0027s residence. \"Klegg,\" said he, \"you will report for fatigue duty at Division Headquarters to-morrow at 7 o\u0027clock with five men. You will take Shorty, Simmons, Sullivan, Tomkins and Wheeler with you.\" \"Very good, sir,\" said Si, saluting.205 \"Si,\" said his father, with a quizzical smile, \"I\u0027ve bin wonderin\u0027, ever since I heard that you wuz an officer, how much o\u0027 the army you commanded. Now I see that if it wuz turned upside down you\u0027d be on the very top.\" \"He leads the army when it goes backward,\" interjected Shorty. \"Gracious, Pap,\" said Si, good-humoredly, \"I haven\u0027t rank enough to get me behind a saplin\u0027 on the battlefield. The Colonel has the pick o\u0027 the biggest tree, the Lieutenant-Colonel and Major take the next; the Captains and Lieutenants take the second growth, and the Sergeants have the saplins. I\u0027m lucky if I git so much as a bush.\" \"Old Rosecrans must have a big saw-log,\" said his father. \"Not much saw-log for old Rosey,\" said Si, resenting even a joking disparagement upon his beloved General. \"During the battle he wuz wherever it wuz hottest, and on horseback, too. Wherever the firm\u0027 wuz the loudest he\u0027d gallop right into it. His staff was shot down all around him, but he never flinched. I tell you, he\u0027s the greatest General in the world.\" The next morning after breakfast, and as Si and Shorty were preparing to go to Division Headquarters, Si said: \"Pap, you just stay at home and keep house to day. Keep your eyes on the boys; I tell it to you in confidence, for I wouldn\u0027t for the world have it breathed outside the company, that Co. Q\u0027s the most everlastin\u0027 set o\u0027 thieves that ever wore uniform. Don\u0027t you ever say a word about it when you get206 home, for it\u0027d never do to have the boys\u0027 folks know anything about it. I\u0027d break their hearts. Me and Shorty, especially Shorty, are the only honest ones in the company. The other fellers\u0027d steal the house from over your head if you didn\u0027t watch \u0027em.\" \"That\u0027s so,\" asseverated Shorty. \"Me and Si especially me is the only honest ones in the company. We\u0027re the only ones you kin really trust.\" \"I\u0027d be sorry to think that Si had learned to steal,\" said the Deacon gravely, at which Shorty could not resist the temptation to give Si a furtive kick. \"But I\u0027ll look out for thieves. We used to have lots o\u0027 them in Posey County, but after we hung one or two, and rid some others on rails, the revival meetin\u0027s seemed to take hold on the rest, and they got converted.\" \"Something like that ought to be done in the army,\" murmured Shorty. \"When you want anything to eat you know where to git it,\" said Si, as they moved off. \"We\u0027ll probably be back in time to git supper.\" The Deacon watched the squad march away, and then turned to think how he would employ himself during the day. He busied himself for awhile cleaning up the cabin and setting things to rights, and flattered himself that his housekeeping was superior to his son\u0027s. Then he decided to cut some wood. He found the ax, \"condemned\" it for some time as to its dullness and bad condition, but finally attacked with it a tree which had been hauled up back of the company line for fuel. It was hard work, and presently he sat down to rest. Loud words of command came from just beyond the hill, and he walked207 over there to see what was going on. He saw a regiment drilling, and watched it for some minutes with interest. Then he walked back to his work, but found to his amazement that his ax was gone. He could see nobody around on whom his suspicions could rest. \"Mebbe somebody\u0027s borrowed it,\" he said, \"and will bring it back when he\u0027s through usin\u0027 it. If he don\u0027t I kin buy a better ax for 10 or 12 bits. Somebody must have axes for sale \u0027round here somewhere.\" He waited awhile for the borrower to return the tool, but as he did not, he gathered up a load of wood and carried it up to the cabin. \"The boys\u0027l be mighty hungry when they git back this evenin\u0027,\" said he to himself. \"I\u0027ll jest git up a good supper for \u0027em. I\u0027ll show Si that the old man knows some p\u0027ints about cookin\u0027, even if he hain\u0027t bin in the army, that\u0027ll open the youngster\u0027s eyes.\" He found a tin pan, put in it a generous supply of beans, and began carefully picking them over and blowing the dust out, the same as he had often seen his wife do. Having finished this to his satisfaction, he set down the pan and went back into the cabin to get the kettle to boil them in. When he returned he found that pan and beans had vanished, and again he saw no one upon whom he could fix his suspicions. The good Deacon began to find the \"old Adam rising within him,\" but as a faithful member of the church he repressed his choler. \"I can\u0027t hardly believe all that Si and Shorty said about the dishonesty of Co. Q,\" he communed with208 himself. \"Many o\u0027 the boys in it I know they\u0027re right from our neighborhood. Good boys as ever lived, and honest as the day is long. Some o\u0027 them belonged to our Sunday school. I can\u0027t believe that they\u0027ve turned out bad so soon. Yet it looks awful suspicious. The last one I see around here was Jed Baskins. His father\u0027s a reggerly ordained preacher. Jed never could \u0027ve took them beans. But who on airth done it?\" The Deacon carefully fastened the door of the cabin, and proceeded with his camp-kettle to the spring to get some water. He found there quite a crowd, with many in line waiting for their chance at the spring. He stood around awhile awaiting his chance, but it did not seem to get any nearer. He said something about the length of time it took, and a young fellow near remarked: \"Here, Uncle, give me your kittle. I\u0027ll git it filled for you.\" Without a thought the Deacon surrendered the kettle to him, and he took his place in line. The Deacon watched him edging up toward the spring for a minute or two, and then his attention was called to a brigade manuvering in a field across the river. After awhile he thought again about his kettle, and looked for the kindly young man who had volunteered to fill it. There were several in the line who looked like him, but none whom he could positively identify as him. \"Which o\u0027 you boys got my kittle?\" he inquired, walking along the line. \"Got your kittle, you blamed teamster,\" they an swered crossly. \"Go away from here. We won\u0027t209 allow teamsters at this spring. It\u0027s only for soldiers. Go to your own spring.\" His kettle was gone, too. That was clear. As the Deacon walked back to the cabin he was very hot in the region of his collar. He felt quite shame faced, too, as to the way the boys would look on his management, in the face of the injunctions they had given him at parting. His temper was not improved by discovering that while he was gone someone had carried off the bigger part of the wood he had laboriously chopped and piled up in front of the cabin. He sat down in the doorway and meditated angrily: \"I\u0027ll be dumbed (there, I\u0027m glad that Mariar didn\u0027t hear me say that. I\u0027m afeared I\u0027m gittin\u0027 to swear just like these other fellers). I\u0027ll be dumbed if I ever imagined there wuz sich a passel o\u0027 condemned thieves on the face o\u0027 the airth. And they all seem sich nice, gentlemanly fellers, too. What\u0027ll we do with them when they git back home?\" Presently he roused himself up to carry out his idea of getting a good meal ready for the boys by the time they returned, tired and hungry. He rummaged through the cabin, and came across an old tin bucket partially filled with scraps of paper. There did not seem to be anything of value in it, and he tossed the contents on the smoldering fire. Instantly there was an explosion which took the barrel off the top of the chimney, sent the stones rattling down, filled the room full of smoke, singed the Deacon\u0027s hair and whiskers, and sped him out of the cabin in great alarm. A crowd quickly gathered to see what was the matter. Just then Si appeared at the head of his squad. He and Shorty hurried to the scene of the disturbance.210 210 (71K) \"What is the matter, Pap?\" Si asked anxiously. \"Why,\" explained his father, \"I was lookin\u0027 round for something to git water in, and I found an old tin bucket with scraps o\u0027 paper in. I throwed them in the fire, and I\u0027m feared I busted your fireplace all to pieces, But I\u0027ll help you to fix it up agin,\" he added deprecatingly. \"But you ain\u0027t hurt any, are you, Pap?\" asked Si,211 anxiously examining his father, and ignoring all thought as to the damage to the dwelling. \"No,\" said his father cheerfully. \"I guess I lost a little hair, but I could spare that. It was about time to git it cut, anyway. I think we kin fix up the fireplace, Si.\" \"Cuss the fireplace, so long\u0027s you\u0027re all right,\" answered Si. \"A little mud \u0027ll straighten that out. You got hold o\u0027 the bucket where me and Shorty \u0027ve bin savin\u0027 up our broken cartridges for a little private Fourth o\u0027 July some night.\" \"But, Si,\" said the Deacon sorrowfully, determined to have it out at once. \"They\u0027re bigger thieves than you said there wuz. They stole your ax but I\u0027ll buy you a better one for 10 or 12 bits; they took your pan and beans, an\u0027 took your camp-kittle, and finally all the wood that I\u0027d cut.\" He looked so doleful that the boys could not help laughing. \"Don\u0027t worry about them, Pap,\" said Si cheer fully. \"We\u0027ll fix them all right. Let\u0027s go inside and straighten things up, and then we\u0027ll have some thing to eat.\" \"But you can\u0027t git nothin\u0027 to eat,\" persisted the Deacon, \"because there\u0027s nothin\u0027 to cook in.\" \"We\u0027ll have something, all the same,\" said Shorty, with a wink of enjoyable anticipation at Si. The two boys carefully stowed away their overcoats, which were rolled up in bundles in a way that would be suspicious to a soldier. They got the interior of the cabin in more presentable shape, and then Shorty went out and produced a camp-kettle from somewhere, in which they made their coffee.212 When this was ready, they shut the door and care fully unrolled their overcoats. A small sugar-cured ham, a box of sardines, a can of peaches, and a couple of loaves of fresh, soft bread developed. \"Yum-yum!\" murmured Shorty, gloating over the viands. \"Where in the world did you git them, boys?\" asked the Deacon in wonderment.213 \"Eat what is set before you, and ask no questions, for conscience\u0027s sake, Pap,\" said Si, slicing off a piece of the ham and starting to broil it for his father. \"That\u0027s what you used to tell me.\" \"Si,\" said the father sternly, as an awful suspicion moved in his mind, \"I hope you didn\u0027t steal \u0027em.\" \"Of course, not, Pap. How kin you think so?\" \"Josiah Klegg,\" thundered the father, \"tell me how you came by them things.\" \"Well, Pap,\" said Si, considerably abashed, \"it was something like this: Our squad was set to work to unload a car o\u0027 Christian Commission things. Me and Shorty pulled off our overcoats and laid them in a corner. When we got through our work and picked up our coats we found these things in them. Some bad men had hid them there, thinkin\u0027 they wuz their overcoats. We thought the best way wuz to punish the thieves by takin\u0027 the things away with us. Now, here\u0027s a piece o\u0027 ham briled almost as nice as mother could do. Take it, and cut you off a slice of that soft bread.\" \"Si, the receiver\u0027s as bad as the thief. I won\u0027t touch it.\" \"Pap, the harm\u0027s been done. No matter who done it, the owner\u0027ll never see his victuals agin. Jest as like he cribbed \u0027em from somebody else. These Christian Commission things wuz sent down for us soljers, anyhow. We\u0027d better have \u0027em than the bummers around the rear. They\u0027ll spile and be wasted if you don\u0027t eat \u0027em, and that\u0027d be a sin.\" Trying to Conquer the Deacon\u0027s Scruples. 212 The savory ham was very appetizing, the Deacon was very hungry, and the argument was sophistical. \"I\u0027ll take it, Si,\" said he with a sigh. \"I don\u0027t214 wonder that the people down here are rebels and all that sort o\u0027 thing. It\u0027s in the air. I\u0027ve felt my principles steadily weakenin\u0027 from the time I crossed the Ohio River.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63228.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
