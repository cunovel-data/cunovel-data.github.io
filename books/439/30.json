{"id":45065,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER VI. BATTLE OF STONE RIVER","content":"THE 200TH IND. IS PRAISED FOR BRAVERY. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE fagged-out 200th Ind. was put in reserve to the brigade, which lay in the line-of-battle. After having got the train safely into camp, the regiment felt that it was incapable of moving another foot. \\n\\n \\n\\n While their coffee was boiling Si and Shorty broke off a few cedar branches to lay under them, and keep out the mud. The rain still drizzled, cold, searching and depressing, but they were too utterly tired to do anything more than spread their over coats on the branches, lay their blankets and ponchos over, and crawl in between. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the few minutes which they allowed to elapse between getting into camp and going to sleep they saw and heard something of the preparations going on around them for the mighty battle, but body and brain were too weary to properly \"sense\" these. They hardly cared what might happen to-morrow. Rest for to-day was everything. They were too weary to worry about anything in the future. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It certainly looks, Shorty,\" said Si, as he crawled in, \"like as if the circus was in town, and the big show\u0027d come off to-morrow, without regard to the68 weather.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let it come and be blamed to it,\" snorted Shorty. \"They can\u0027t git up nothin\u0027 wuss\u0027n we\u0027ve bin havin\u0027 to-day, let them try their durndest. But I tell you, Mr. Si Klegg, I want you to lay mighty still to-night. If you git to rollin\u0027 around in your usual animated style and tanglin\u0027 up the bedclothes, I\u0027ll kick you out into the rain, and make you stay there. Do you hear me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You bet I\u0027ll lay quiet,\" said Si, as together they gave the skillful little kick only known to veteran campaigners by which they brought the blankets snugly up around their feet. \"You could sooner wake up a fence-rail than me. I want to tell you, too, not to git to dreamin\u0027 of pryin\u0027 wagons out of the mud, and chasin\u0027 rebel cavalry. I won\u0027t have it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The reveille the next morning would have promptly awakened even more tired sleepers than Si and Shorty. Even before the dull, damp drums began rolling and the fifes shrieking the air of enforced gaiety along the sinuous line of blue which stretched for miles through red, muddy cottonfields and cedar tangles wet as bath-room sponges, there came from far away on the extreme right a deepening roll of musketry, punctuated with angry cannon-shots and the faint echo of yells and answering cheers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s McCook opening the battle,\" said the officers, answering the anxious looks of the men. \"He\u0027s to hold the rebels out there, while Crittenden sweeps around on the left, captures Murfreesboro, and takes them in the rear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Miles away to the left came the sound of musketry and cannons, as if to confirm this. But the firing there died down, while that to the right increased69 with regular, crashing volleys from muskets and artillery. \\n\\n \\n\\n The 200th Ind. was in that exceedingly trying position for soldiers, where they can hear everything but see nothing. The cedar thicket in which they stood shut off the view in every direction. The Colonel kept officers and men standing strictly in place, ready for any contingency. Si and Shorty leaned on their muskets and anxiously watched the regimental commander as he sat rigidly in his saddle, with his fixed gaze bent in the direction of the awful tumult. The Adjutant had ridden forward a little ways to where he could get a better view. The other officers stood stiffly in their places, with the points of their drawn swords resting on the ground, and their hands clasped on the hilts, and watched the Colonel intently. Sometimes they would whisper a few words to those standing near them. The Captain of Co. Q drew geometric figures in the mud with the point of his sword. \\n\\n \\n\\n Constantly the deafening crash came nearer, and crept around farther to the right. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si gave a swift glance at Shorty. His partner\u0027s teeth were set, his face drawn and bloodless, his eyes fixed immovably on the Colonel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Awful fightin\u0027 goin\u0027 on out there, Shorty,\" said Si, in hushed voice. \"I\u0027m afraid they\u0027re lickin\u0027 our fellers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Confound it!\" snorted Shorty, \"why in thunder don\u0027t they move us out, and give us something to do? This is hell standin\u0027 here listenin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A teamster, hatless and coatless, with his hair70 standing up, came tearing through the brush, mounted on his saddle-mule. \\n\\n \\n\\n A chorus of yells and curses greeted his appearance. It was immense relief for the men to have something to swear at. \\n\\n \\n\\n A Frightened Teamster 70 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Run, you egg-sucking hound. \\n\\n \"Run, you scald-headed dominie.71 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Somebody busted a cap in your neighborhood, old white-liver.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Seen the ghost of a dead rebel, Pilgarlic?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pull back your eyes, you infernal mulewhacker. A limb\u0027ll brush \u0027em off.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look at his hair standin\u0027 up stiffer\u0027n bristles on a boar\u0027s back.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your mules got more sand \u0027n you. They\u0027re standing where you left \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course, you\u0027re whipped and all cut to pieces. You was that when you heard the first gun crack.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Get out of the way, and let him run himself to death. That\u0027s all he\u0027s fit for.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ve no business in men\u0027s clothes. Put on petticoats.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go it, rabbit; go it, cotton-tail you\u0027ve heard a dog bark.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Chickee chickee skip for the barn. Hawk\u0027s in the air.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let him alone. He\u0027s in a hurry to get back and pay his sutler\u0027s bill.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The teamster gasped out: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027d better all git out o\u0027 here as fast as the Lord\u0027ll let you. Johnson\u0027s Division\u0027s cut all to pieces and runnin\u0027. There\u0027ll be a million rebels on top o\u0027 you in another minnit.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Capt. McGillicuddy,\" said the Colonel sternly, but without turning his head, \"either bayonet that cowardly rascal or gag him and tie him to a tree.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Captain turned to give the order to Corp\u0027l Klegg, but the teamster struck his mule with his whip, and went tearing on through the brush before the order could be given.72 \\n\\n \\n\\n Some severely-wounded men came slowly pushing their way through the chaparral. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s awful hot out there,\" they said. \"The rebels got the start of us, and caught our battery horses off to water. They outflanked us bad, but the boys are standin\u0027 up to \u0027em and they\u0027re gettin\u0027 help, an \u0027ll lick the stuffin\u0027 out of \u0027em yet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The regiment gave the plucky fellows a cheer. \\n\\n \\n\\n A riderless horse, frantic from his wounds and the terrific noise, tore through the brush, and threatened to dash over Co. Q. Si and Shorty saw the danger, and before the Captain could give an order they sprang forward, and, at considerable risk, succeeded in getting hold of the reins and partially calming the poor brute. The eagles on the saddle cloth showed that he belonged to a Colonel. He was led to the rear, and securely haltered to a young cedar. The incident served a purpose in distracting for awhile the attention of the regiment. \\n\\n \\n\\n The noise in front and to the right swept farther away for a little while, and the men\u0027s hearts rose with a cheer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now the reinforcements are getting in. Why in the world don\u0027t they send us forward?\" they said. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Colonel still sat rigidly, with his face straight to the front. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the noise began to roll nearer again, and the men\u0027s hearts to sink. \\n\\n \\n\\n The wounded men coming back became a continuous procession. They spoke less confidently, and were anxious to know what was taking place on other parts of the line. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The whole infernal Southern Confederacy\u0027s out73 there,\" said one boy, who was holding his shattered right hand in his left, with his thumb pressed hard on the artery, to stanch the blood, \"in three lines-of-battle, stretching from daybreak to sunset. The boys have been standing them off bully, though, but I don\u0027t know how long they can keep it up. Thomas and Crittenden ought to be walking right over every thing, for there can\u0027t be anybody in front of them. They\u0027re all out there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Two musicians came laboring through, carrying a stretcher on which was an officer with part of his face shot away. Si felt himself growing white around the mouth and sick at the stomach, but he looked the other way, and drew in a long, full breath. \\n\\n \\n\\n The storm now seemed to be rolling toward them at railroad speed. Suddenly the woods became alive with men running back, some with their guns in their hands, many without. Some were white with fear, and silent; some were in a delirium of rage, and yelling curses. Officers, bareheaded, and wildly excited, were waving their swords, and calling regiments and companies by name to halt and rally. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Adjutant came galloping back, his horse knocking the fugitives right and left. He shouted, to make himself heard in the din: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The whole division is broken and going back. Our brigade is trying to hold the rebels. They need us at once.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Colonel turned calmly in his saddle, and his voice rang out clear, distinct, and measured, as if on parade: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Attention, 200th Indiana!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Load at will LOAD!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A windrow of bright ramrods flashed and weaved in the air. A wave of sharp, metallic clicks ran from one end of the line to the other. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shoulder ARMS!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Right FACE!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Forward MARCH!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n What happened immediately after emerging from the cedars Si could never afterward distinctly recall. He could only vaguely remember as one does the impression of a delirium seeing, as the regiment swung from column into line, a surging sea of brown men dashing forward against a bank of blue running along a rail fence, and from which rose incessant flashes of fire and clouds of white smoke. The 200th Ind. rushed down to the fence, to the right of the others; the fierce flashes flared along its front; the white smoke curled upward from it. He did not remember any order to begin firing; did not remember when he began. He only remembered presently feeling his gun-barrel so hot that it burned his hand, but this made him go on firing more rapidly than before. He was dimly conscious of his comrades dropping around him, but this did not affect him. He also remembered catching sight of Shorty\u0027s face, and noticing that it was as black as that of a negro, but this did not seem strange. \\n\\n \\n\\n He felt nothing, except a consuming rage to shoot into and destroy those billows of brown fiends surging incessantly toward him. Consciousness only came back to him after the billows had surged back ward into the woods, leaving the red mud of the field splotched with brown lumps which had lately been men.75 \\n\\n \\n\\n As his mind cleared his hand flinched from the hot gun-barrel, and he looked down curiously to see the rain-drops turn into steam as they struck it. His throat was afire from the terrible powder thirst. He lifted his canteen to his lips and almost drained it. He drew a long breath, and looked around to see what had happened since they left the cedars. Shorty was by his side, and unhurt. He now under stood why his face was so black. He could feel the thick incrustation of powder and sweat on his own. Several of Co. Q were groaning on the ground, and the Captain was detailing men to carry them back to where the Surgeon had established himself. Two were past all surgery, staring with soulless eyes into the lowering clouds. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Poor Bill and Ebe,\" said Si, gazing sorrowfully at the bodies. \"Co. Q will miss them. What good boys they—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Were\" stuck in his throat. That those strong, active, ever-ready comrades of a few minutes before now merely \"were\" was unspeakable. \\n\\n \\n\\n His thoughts were distracted by a rebel battery on the hill sending a volley of shells at the fence. Some went over, and tore gaps in the cedars beyond. One struck the corner of the fence near him, and set the rails to flying. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I like fence-rails in their place as well as any man,\" said Shorty, as they dodged around; \"but a fence-rail\u0027s got no business sailin\u0027 \u0027round in the air like a bird.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n An Aid rode up to the Colonel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The General\u0027s compliments, Colonel. He directs me to express to you his highest compliments on the76 splendid manner in which you have defended your position. You and your men have done nobly. But we are outflanked, and it will be necessary to retire to a new position about a half-mile to the rear. You will withdraw your regiment by companies, so as to attract as little attention from the enemy as possible. As soon as they are under cover of the cedars you will move rapidly to the new position.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well,\" said the Colonel, saluting. \"You will be good enough to say to the General that my men and myself appreciate highly his praise. We are proud to receive it, and shall try to deserve it in the future. His orders shall be immediately obeyed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They call this a civil war,\" said Shorty, as an other volley of shells tore around. \"Seems to me sometimes that it\u0027s too durned civil. If we\u0027re goin\u0027 to git out of here, we might save compliments for a quieter time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n One by one the companies filed back into the cedars, Co. Q being last. Just as they started the rebels on the opposite hill discovered the movement, raised a yell, and started across the field. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Halt Front!\" commanded the Captain. \"Those fellows are too tumultuous and premature. We must check them up a little. Wait till they come to that little branch, then everybody pick his man and let him have it. Aim below the belt.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The frenzy of the first struggle was now gone from Si\u0027s mind; instead had come a deadly determination to make every shot tell. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to fetch that mounted officer on their right,\" he said to Shorty and those around him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well,\" said Shorty. \"I\u0027ll take that Captain77 near him who\u0027s wavin\u0027 his sword and yellin\u0027. The rest o\u0027 you fellers pick out different men.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The rebel line was in the weeds which bordered the branch when the Captain gave the order to fire. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the smoke arose the mounted officer and the yelling Captain were down. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If somebody else didn\u0027t get them, we did,\" said Shorty, as they turned and rushed back into the cedars. \\n\\n \\n\\n The rebels were only checked momentarily. They soon came swarming on, and as Co. Q crashed through the cedars the rebels were yelling close be hind. Fortunately, they could not do any effective firing, on account of the brush. But when they came to the edge of the thicket there was a long run across a furrowed, muddy cottonfield, to reach the knoll on which the brigade was re-forming. The battery was already in action there, throwing shells over the heads of Co. Q at the rebels swarming out of the cedars in pursuit. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si and Shorty threw away overcoats, blankets, haversacks and canteens everything which would impede their running, except their guns and cartridge-boxes. Their caps were gone, and Si had lost one shoe in the mud. They all sat down on the ground for a minute and panted to get their breath. \\n\\n \\n\\n The rebels were checked, but only temporarily. They were thronging out in countless multitudes, lining up into regiments and brigades, preparatory to a rush across the field upon the brigade. Away to the right of the brigade rebel batteries had been concentrated, which were shelling it and the ground to the rear, to prevent any assistance being sent it.78 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Captain,\" said the Colonel, riding up to Co. Q, \"the General says that we have got to stay here and hold those fellows back until the new line can be formed along the pike. We haven\u0027t ammunition enough for another fight. You\u0027ll have to send a Corporal and a squad back to the pike to bring up some more. Pick out men that\u0027ll be sure to come back, and in a hurry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Corp\u0027l Klegg,\" said the Captain, without an instant\u0027s hesitation, \"you hear what\u0027s to be done. Take five men and go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si looked around to see if there was someone he could borrow a shoe from. But that was hardly a time when men were likely to lend shoes. He picked Shorty and four others. They flung down their guns and started on a run for the pike. \\n\\n \\n\\n The batteries were sweeping the fields with shells, but they were so intent on their errand that they paid no attention to the demoniac shrieks of the hurtling pieces of iron. \\n\\n \\n\\n They gained the other side of the field, but as they entered the welcome shelter of the woods they encountered an officer with a drawn sword, commanding a line of men. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stop there, you infernal, cowardly rascals,\" he yelled. \"Pick up those guns there, and get into line, or I\u0027ll shoot you. You, Corporal, ought to be ashamed of yourself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027re after ammunition for the 200th Ind.,\" gasped Si. \"We must have it right away. Where\u0027s the division ammunition train?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That ammunition story\u0027s played. Can\u0027t work it on me. Where\u0027s your regiment? Where\u0027s your79 caps? Where\u0027s your shoes? Where\u0027s your guns? You\u0027re rattled out of your senses. Stop here and cool off. Pick up guns there and fall into line.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Name o\u0027 God, Lieutenant,\" said Shorty excitedly. \"This\u0027s no time for any foolishness. Our regiment\u0027s out there on the hill without any ammunition. The rebels are gittin\u0027 ready to jump it, four or five to one. Don\u0027t fool, for heaven\u0027s sake. There\u0027s not a minute to waste. Come with us and help us git the ammunition. That\u0027s a blame sight more important than stoppin\u0027 these here runaways, who\u0027re no good when they are stopped. Come along, for God\u0027s sake.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His earnestness impressed the Lieutenant. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lieut. Evans,\" he called out, \"take command of the line while I go back with these men to the ammunition-train. I can get it quicker for them than they can. Your Colonel should have sent a commissioned officer with you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The Colonel needs all the officers he has left with him,\" panted Shorty, running ahead of the rest. \"Everybody back there\u0027s got all he can attend to, and we couldn\u0027t really be spared.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a crowd of similar men surging around the ammunition wagons, each eager to get his load and rush back. The covers of the wagons had been torn off, and a man stood in each, pitching the boxes to the clamoring details. All were excited and reckless. The pitching would be wild, or the catching bad, and occasionally a box would strike a man on the head or body and knock him down. He would scarcely stop to swear, but snatch up his precious box and rush off toward his regiment.80 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Open out here, let us in,\" commanded the Lieutenant, striking right and left with the flat of his sword. It was not a moment for gentle courtesies. The crowd opened up, and Si and Shorty pushed in near the wheels. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now give us six boxes in a hurry,\" commanded the Lieutenant. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si caught the first box, Shorty the second, and before the Lieutenant was hardly done speaking the rest had theirs, and started back on the run, accompanied by the Lieutenant. The boxes were very heavy and the mud was deep, but they went faster than they had ever done, even when running from the rebels. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m awfully afraid you\u0027ll have a time getting across the field there,\" said the Lieutenant, as they came to the edge, and he surveyed the ground in front doubtfully. \"Lieut. Evans says they\u0027ve moved a battery up closer, and are sweeping the field with canister.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We don\u0027t care what they\u0027re shootn\u0027,\" said Si resolutely. \"We\u0027re goin\u0027 back to the regiment with these boxes, or die a-tryin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go on, then, and God help you,\" said the Lieutenant. \"I\u0027d go with you if I could do any good.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si arranged his box for a desperate rush. A blast of canister swept through, cutting down shrubs, splattering the mud, and shrieking viciously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let\u0027s get as far as we can before they fire again,\" he shouted, and plunged forward. Half-way across the field his foot caught in a devil\u0027s shoe-string, and down he went in the mud, with the heavy box driving him deeper.81 \\n\\n \\n\\n Just then another blast of canister hurtled across the field. \\n\\n \\n\\n A Lucky Fall 81 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Golly, it was lucky, after all, that I was tripped,\" said Si, rising, stunned and dripping. \"That load of canister was meant for me personally.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Two minutes later he flung the box down before the company, and sank panting on the ground. The others came up after. Some had teen grazed by canister, but none seriously wounded. They arrived just in the nick of time, for the regiment had expended its last cartridge in repulsing the last assault, and was now desperately fixing bayonets to meet the next with cold steel. The lids of the boxes were pried off with bayonets, and the Sergeants ran along the companies distributing the packages. The assault was met with a stream of fire, given with steady deadliness, which sent the rebels back to their covert. \\n\\n \\n\\n An Aid dashed across the field to the brigade commander. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The line is now formed,\" he said. \"Retire your command to it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n That night, after the battle had ceased, Si and Shorty were seated on a rail by the Nashville pike munching rations which they had luckily found in a thrown-away haversack. They were allowed no fires, they had no blankets nor overcoats, and it was bitter cold. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shorty, you said last night you was sure that they couldn\u0027t git up nothin\u0027 to-day that\u0027d be as bad as what we had yesterday,\" said Si. \"I bel\u0027eve that I\u0027d rather guard wagon-trains and fight cavalry than have such another day as this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think the lake of brimstone\u0027d be a pleasant change from this,\" snorted Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63217.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
