{"id":45055,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. A CLOSE CALL","content":"CORPORAL KLEGG HAS AN EXCITING ADVENTURE GUARDING A FORAGE TRAIN. \"COMPANY Q\u0027s bin detailed to go out \u0027n\u0027 help guard a forage train to-morrow,\" said the Orderly one evening at roll-call. \"You fellers wants to all be up \u0027n\u0027 dressed bright \u0027n\u0027 early, with yer cartridge-boxes full \u0027n\u0027 a day\u0027s rations in yer haversacks. Be sure yer guns is in good order, fer likely\u0027s not we\u0027ll have a squirmish afore we git back.\" The 200th Ind. had been lying in camp for two or three days, and the ambitious heroes who composed that regiment were getting tired of loafing about. Nothing chafed the raging patriotism of the new troops like a condition, however brief, of masterly inactivity. They refused to be comforted unless they were on the warpath all the time. Their ideal of a soldier\u0027s life was to take a rebel battery every morning before breakfast, storm a line of works to give them an appetite for dinner, and spend the afternoon charging with cold steel the serried columns of the foe and wading around through seas of gore. So Corporal Klegg and Shorty and the rest of the boys betook themselves with alacrity to the work of preparation for the duties of the morrow. Members of the other companies watched the proceedings with jealous eye. They almost turned green with envy because they were not detailed for the expedition instead of Co. Q. \"Say, Si,\" remarked Shorty, thoughtfully, \"hadn\u0027t we better write a letter home? Who knows but we\u0027ll be as dead as mackerels to-morrer night!\" \"Fiddlesticks!\" said Si. \"What\u0027s the use o\u0027 havin\u0027 a funeral afore there\u0027s any corpse! We\u0027ve bin through one fight \u0027n\u0027 didn\u0027t git hurt, \u0027n\u0027 I\u0027ve made up my mind there\u0027s no use gittin\u0027 into a stew over a thing that may hap\u0027n \u0027n\u0027 may not. Time \u0027nuff to fret \u0027bout it when it comes. I recolleck one thing I learned in Sunday-school—let\u0027s see, it was \u0027S\u0027ficient unto the day is the evil thereof,\u0027 or suthin\u0027 like that. Strikes me that\u0027s a good passidge o\u0027 Scripter fer a soldier to keep pasted in his hat. I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 ter hang back fer fear a billit \u0027ll hit me, nuther. If we\u0027re going to be killed we can\u0027t help it, so let\u0027s not fret our gizzards out!\" And Si crammed a handful of hardtack into his haversack. Si\u0027s cheery view of the case was not without its effect upon Shorty. Indeed, it cannot be denied that there was a great deal of common sense in his homely, good-natured philosophy. Sooner or later every soldier who did not \"peter out\" came gradually to adopt Si\u0027s idea as the governing principle of his military career. \"Shouldn\u0027t wonder if you was \u0027bout right, after all,\" said Shorty, as he sliced up some bacon to have it ready for an early breakfast. \"You\u0027re better\u0027n medicine, Si, to a feller w\u0027at gits the blues sometimes!\" The preparations were soon made, and Co. Q went to bed early. In the morning the Orderly came around and stirred the boys up an hour before reveille, as they were ordered to be ready to start at daylight. The primary object of the expedition was forage for the animals, the supply of which had run short. Besides this, each man had a secondary purpose, and that was to gather in something on his own hook that would satisfy his longing for a change from the regulation diet. This was always the unwritten part of the order to \"go out foraging.\" Daylight was just streaking over the camp when Co. Q, equipped in light marching order, leaving knapsacks behind, moved out to where the half dozen wagons detailed from the regimental transportation were ready for the start. Each regiment in the brigade furnished a company and the same number of wagons. The impatient mules were braying and flapping their ears, as if they understood that they were to be the chief beneficiaries of the raid. \"Pile in, boys!\" said the Orderly, and they clambered into the wagons. The guards were permitted to ride until there were symptoms of danger. Then the muleteers, bestriding the big \"wheelers,\" cracked their long whips like pistol-snots, addressed to the mules the usual words of exhortation, and the long procession drew out upon the stony pike and took a brisk trot. Considerable foraging had already been done in the vicinity, and it was expected the train would have to go out several miles in order to fully accomplish its object. The boys were in fine spirits and enjoyed their morning ride, albeit the jolting of the wagons gave them a thorough shaking up. \"I guess they forgot to put any springs in when they built these wagons!\" said Shorty, as he shifted his position so that he might catch the bumps in a new place for a while. \"Jest thinkin\u0027 that way myself,\" replied Si; \"but all the same, it beats travelin\u0027 on the hoof all holler!\" Three or four miles out from camp the train was halted while the officers in command made inquiries of a cadaverous native who was sunning himself on the fence and whose principal occupation seemed to be chewing tobacco and distributing the resultant liquid around in a promiscuous way. \"Good morning, stranger,\" said the officer, \"have you any corn on your place?\" \"Haint got a dog-goned ear left!\" was the surly answer. \"Some o\u0027 you-unses men wuz out here yisterdy \u0027n\u0027 tuk every bit I hed.\" This may or may not have been true. Inquiries of this nature always developed the fact that it was a man\u0027s neighbors who had plenty of corn; he never had any himself. \"There\u0027s ole man Scroggs,\" he continued; \"he lives a matter of two miles from hyar. I \u0027low ye\u0027ll git sum if ye go thar. He growed a power o\u0027 cawn this yeah; he sold a heap, but I reckon he\u0027s got a right smart left.\" During this time a couple of men had been making a hasty examination of the outbuildings on the place. They reported that they could find nothing in the way of forage. If the man had any corn he had carefully concealed it. The train started on to pay a visit to old man Scroggs. \"Say, old pard,\" asked Si as his wagon drove past, \"is there any rebs \u0027round here?\" \"There wuz a few Confedrit critter-men ridin\u0027 \u0027bout hyar this mawnin\u0027;—mebby ye\u0027ll run agin \u0027em \u0027afore night.\" \"How many o\u0027 your boys is among em?\" \"We\u0027uns is all union.\" \"Jest as long as we\u0027re \u0027round, I s\u0027pose!\" said Si. A mile further on those who were in the lead, rising to the crest of a hill, saw—or thought they saw a few vagrant cavalrymen far ahead. The train was halted and dispositions were made to meet any emergency likely to arise. The men were ordered to \"tumble out\" of the wagons. The main body was formed in advance. A line of skirmishers was deployed in front and flankers were thrown out on either side. Thus protected, the mule drivers again cracked their whips and the procession moved cautiously forward. \"Now keep yer eyes skinned,\" said Si to Shorty as they trailed along through the woods and fields and over fences, on one of the flanks. \"If any of them raskils comes dodgin\u0027 \u0027round here let\u0027s try \u0027n\u0027 have the first crack at \u0027em \u0027n\u0027 git the bulge on the rest o\u0027 the boys!\" Keenly alert, with muskets loaded and capped, they crept carefully along, poking their noses into every thicket and peering around every building. It was clear that there would not be anything in the nature of a surprise if the whole line was as well taken care of as the particular point guarded by Corporal Klegg and his faithful friend Shorty. \"It\u0027s some like huntin\u0027 squirrels up in the woods of Posey County,\" said Si, as they forced their way through a patch of brambles. \"\u0027Pears to be rayther more excitin\u0027 than huntin\u0027 squirrels,\" said Shorty. \"Ye know squirrels doesn\u0027t shute back at a feller as them pesky rebbles does, an\u0027 the fun \u0027s all on one side. I reckon ef squirrels c\u0027d shute there wouldn\u0027t be so much huntin\u0027 of \u0027em!\" It was really a disappointment to Si that he found no opportunity to squint along the barrel of his musket in range of a foe. If any of his misguided fellow-citizens were in the neighborhood they considered discretion the better part of valor and kept out of harm\u0027s way. In due time the Scroggs plantation was reached. A hasty examination showed that there was an abundance of corn on the place to load the wagons, and arrangements for a sudden transfer of the property were quickly made. A third of the force established a cordon of picket-posts around the marauding party, covering all the avenues of approach, with re serves at convenient points. The remainder of the troops stacked arms and entered briskly upon the work of confiscation. An Assault on the Well-filled Corn Crib 191 Part of the harvest had already been gathered, and the first assault was made on a well-filled cornhouse—one of a group of dilapidated out-buildings a little way from the dwelling. \"Old man\" Scroggs protested with profane vehemence, reinforced by the \"old woman\" and the entire family of children. We say \"entire family,\" because there could not well have been a more numerous progeny in one household anywhere outside of Utah. The head of the family cursed and swore, and his wife and the big girls looked as if they wanted to do the same thing, as they stood wringing their hands, their eyes flashing fire while the small-fry stood around and sobbed with a vague idea that some dire calamity had befallen them. The old Kentuckian declared that he was a \"union man,\" and that he would demand of the Government full revenge for this outrage. It was noticed that there were no young men around as there should be according to the economy of nature, to preserve the balance of sex in so large a family. The officer in command asked him where all his sons were. \"Wall, I kaint tell yer \u0027zactly whar they is,\" was the reply. \"They ain\u0027t to hum jest now. I \u0027low they\u0027ve got a right to g\u0027way ef they want ter.\" The officer had been informed that there were several representatives of the Scroggs family in the rebel army. The old man\u0027s avowal of loyalty was taken for what it was worth. That it was not rated at a high figure was well attested by the appearance of the plantation a few hours later. Meanwhile the soldiers kept right along in the duty assigned them. The corn-house was surrounded by wagons, the roof was gently lifted off, and in scarcely more time than it takes to tell the story six or eight of the wagons were heaped with the contents. The mules wagged their tails and brayed in anticipation of the picnic they would have when they got back to camp. Then the force moved some distance and attacked a large field of standing corn. The stalks had been \"topped,\" but the ears were yet ungathered. The men started in between the rows and swept through that field like a cyclone, plucking the ears right and left. Bags, baskets and boxes were pressed into the service, and as there were not enough of these to go\u0027 round many bore the corn to the wagons by armfuls. It did not take more than two or three hours to strip every ear from the field. A visitation of overgrown Kansas grasshoppers could not have done a more thorough job. \"Fo\u0027 de Lawd, boss,\" said an old darky who had been roosting on the fence watching the spoilers, \"I nebber seed de crap gaddered so quick since I\u0027se bawn. You\u0027uns all is powerful smart, da\u0027t shuah!\" But where were Corporal Klegg and his comrade. Shorty, while all this was going on? They had been stationed as sentinels near a house, half a mile beyond, on the pike. They were cautioned to keep a sharp lookout, and for a time they obeyed their instructions to the letter. Their vigilant eyes swept the surrounding country, and no rebel could have crept up on them without getting a pair of bullets from their ready muskets. They saw no signs of an enemy, and after a while it began to grow monotonous. \"Shorty,\" said Si, \"I don\u0027t b\u0027lieve there\u0027s any seceshers in these parts, an\u0027 there ain\u0027t any use\u0027n us both keepin\u0027 this thing up. You jest watch out awhile \u0027n\u0027 I\u0027ll skin around \u0027n\u0027 see what I kin find.\" Shorty agreed to this, taking it as an order from his superior officer. Si threw his gun up to a \"right shoulder shift\" and started off, after again urging upon his companion the importance of attending strictly to business. Si had not gone far till he saw, penned in a corner of the barnyard, a cow with a full udder, from which a frisky young calf was busily engaged in pumping nourishment. A violent feeling of envy toward that calf began immediately to rage in the \u0027breast of Si. He had not had a draft of fresh milk since he had left home, and he felt that a little refreshment of that kind would be particularly gratifying to his interior organism. It would strengthen him and give him new courage to stand up to the rack if they should happen to get into a fight. \"I say. Shorty,\" he called, \"cum \u0027ere a minnit, quick!\" Si\u0027s conscience smote him for calling Shorty from his duty and leaving the post unguarded, but the temptation was too strong for him to resist, and he yielded to the impulse to take the chances. Shorty came on the run, with eyes wide open, thinking his comrade had discovered some rebels hanging around. \"Look there!\" said Si, pointing to the maternal scene that has been alluded to. \"Let\u0027s have some o\u0027 that. We\u0027ll git over the fence \u0027n\u0027 you jest hold the calf while I milk our canteens full. \u0027Twont take more\u0027n a jiffy!\" \"We ort n\u0027t to leave the post, ort we?\" suggested Shorty. \"Oh, there ain\u0027t no danger,\" Si replied; \"an\u0027 besides, you can keep lookin\u0027 out while you\u0027re hangin\u0027 on to the calf. I was alters a good milker \u0027n\u0027 I\u0027ll fill up these canteens in a couple o\u0027 minnits.\" So they climbed over and leaned their muskets against the fence. Shorty seized the calf and held it with a firm grip, in spite of its struggling and bleating. The cow seemed disposed at first to resent the interference, but Si\u0027s persuasive \"So, bossy\" proved effectual in calming her fears, and she stood placidly chewing her cud while Si, spurred on by a guilty conscience, milked with all his might. Shorty Held the Calf 195 The canteens were soon filled, and, with out stopping to drink. Si and Shorty hurried back to their post of duty. All was quiet, and no harm had resulted from their brief absence. \"I told ye \u0027twould be all right,\" said Si. \"Now, we\u0027ll jest empty one o\u0027 these canteens—here, take a swig—\u0027n\u0027 we\u0027ll carry the other to camp. It\u0027ll be jest bully to have milk in our coffee agin!\" Then they betook themselves to duty with redoubled vigilance, to atone for their derelictions. After watching for an hour without seeing anything, Si said he would take another little turn around the place. Boldly advancing to the house, which was some distance in front of their post, he was met by a girl of about 18. She was rather pretty, but to Si\u0027s ardent imagination she was like a vision of surpassing loveliness. She greeted him pleasantly—for Si was a comely youth—and, if the truth must be told, he actually forgot for the moment all about his duty. When she said she would get him a good dinner, and invited him into the house to sit while she prepared it, he just went right along. But his conscience began to thump so loudly that after a few minutes he told her he guessed he\u0027d have to go, but would be delighted to return in an hour and partake of her hospitality. \"May I bring Shorty—he\u0027s my pard—\u0027long with me?\" he timidly asked. \"Certainly!\" she replied, with a sweet smile; and Si went away, his nerves tingling with pleasant emotions to the very tips of his fingers. \"Shorty,\" he said, as he came up to \"I\u0027ve struck it this time. Over to that house there\u0027s the purtiest gal I ever see.\" \"Wha-a-a-a-t!\" interjected Shorty, with a look of astonishment; for he knew something about Si and Annabel—the girl he left behind him—and he was both surprised and pained at Si\u0027s treasonable enthusiasm. Si easily divined his thoughts, for something of the same nature had already caused his own heart to palpitate in a reproving way. \"Of—c-c-course—I d-d-don\u0027t—mean th-th-that. Shorty,\" he stammered \"but she\u0027s a nice girl, anyhow, \u0027n\u0027 she\u0027s gittin\u0027 up a dinner fer me \u0027n\u0027 you. Bet ye it\u0027ll be a nice lay-out, too!\" Shorty did not feel quite at ease in his mind about leaving the post again, but Si assured him it would be all right. The peculiar circumstances of the case had sadly warped Si\u0027s judgment. So they went to the house and were cordially greeted by their fair young hostess, who was flying around, putting the finishing touches to the meal she had prepared for them. \"Jiminy, don\u0027t that smell good?\" said Si to Shorty in an undertone, as his sensitive nostrils caught the savory odors that arose from the nicely-spread board. The young soldiers stood their guns on the floor in a corner of the room, preliminary to an assault on the edibles. \"Ugh!\" exclaimed the young woman, with a coquettish shiver, \"be them awful things loaded?\" \"N—no!\" said Si; \"they won\u0027t hurt ye if ye don\u0027t touch \u0027em!\" Si was learning to fib a little, and he wanted to quiet the girl\u0027s fears. The boys were soon seated at the table, bountifully supplied with ham, chicken, eggs, bread and butter, honey, and all the accessories of a well-ordered repast. They fell to with an eagerness that was, perhaps, justified by the long time that had elapsed since they had had a \"square meal.\" Si thought that never in his life had anything tasted so good. While they were thus engaged, without a thought of impending danger, the girl suddenly opened the door, leading to the dining room. A wild-eyed man—who proved to be her brother—in the uniform of a rebel soldier, dashed in, and, presenting a cocked revolver, demanded their unconditional and immediate surrender. They were in a tight place. But Si proved equal to the sudden and appalling emergency. It flashed through his mind in an instant how the girl had \"played it\" on him. He made up his mind that he would rather be shot than be captured under such circumstances. Si Sprang Upon Him 199 Si sprang up, and the rebel, true to his word, fired. Si dodged, and the ball only chipped a piece from his left ear. There was not time to get and use his gun. With the quickness of a cat Si sprang upon him, and with a blow of his fist laid him sprawling upon the floor. Disarming him, he placed the revolver at his head and triumphantly exclaimed: \"Now, gol durn ye, you\u0027re my prisoner. I\u0027d like to blow the top o\u0027 yer head off fer spilin\u0027 my dinner, but I won\u0027t do it this time. But you jist git up \u0027n\u0027 come \u0027long with me!\" With his complete mastery of the situation, Si\u0027s confidence returned, and Shorty, who had been dazed and helpless at first, recovered himself and came to his assistance. But at this instant their ears caught the sound of horses\u0027 hoofs galloping down the pike. Si\u0027s quick perception told him that is was a dash of rebel cavalrymen, and that a few moments later escape would be impossible. \"Grab yer gun an\u0027 git!\" he said to Shorty, at the same time casting one ferocious glance at the terrified girl, who stood, white and speechless, contemplating the scene. Si and Shorty dashed out of the house and started for the reserve, at the highest speed of which their legs were capable. On clattered the horses, and a few shots from the carbines of the swift-riding horsemen whistled through the air. Six feet at a jump, with thumping hearts and bulging eyes, the fugitives almost flew over the ground, throwing quick glances at their pursuers, and then ahead, in the hope of catching a glimpse of succor. \u0027shorty if We--only Git--out O\u0027 This--\u0027 203 \"Shorty, if we only git out o\u0027 this—\" but Si found he hadn\u0027t any wind to spare to finish the sentence. We must leave to the reader\u0027s imagination the good resolutions as to his future conduct that were forming in Si\u0027s mind at this critical juncture. He saw the awful consequences of yielding to the influence of that alluring young woman and her seductive dinner. What he had read about Adam and the trouble Eve got him into, in pretty much the same way, flashed before him. It was a good time to resolve that he wouldn\u0027t do so any more. Shorty, long and lank, was swifter on his feet than Si. Hardtack and bacon had not yet reduced the latter\u0027s surplus flesh to a degree that enabled him to run well. Shorty kept ahead, but would not desert his comrade, slowing up for an instant now and then to give Si, who was straining to the utmost every nerve, and puffing like a locomotive on an upgrade, a chance to keep within supporting distance. The soldiers of the reserve taking the alarm, came out at a double-quick and were fortunately able to cover the retreat of Si and Shorty. The half dozen cavalrymen, upon the appearance of so large a force, turned their horses and galloped away. \"Hello, Si,\" said the Orderly of Co. Q, \"yer ear\u0027s bleedin\u0027. What hurt ye?\" \"Fell down and scratched it on a brier!\" said Si, as soon as he was able to speak. That night Si and Shorty sat on a log by the campfire talking over the events of the day. \"Don\u0027t ye never blow on this thing,\" said Si. \"It\u0027ll be a cold day for us if they\u0027d find it out.\" \"There ain\u0027t no danger o\u0027 my tellin\u0027,\" replied Shorty. \"But, say, ain\u0027t that a nice girl out there?\" \"She\u0027s a mean rebel, that\u0027s what she is! But that was a smart trick o\u0027 her\u0027n, wasn\u0027t it?\" \"Come mighty near bein\u0027 too smart fer us!\" replied Shorty. \"I don\u0027t want no more such close shaves in mine. You \u0027member the story of the spider and the fly, don\u0027t ye? Well, she was the spider \u0027n\u0027 we was two poor little fool flies!\" \"Shorty,\" said Si, \"I\u0027d a mighty sight ruther be an angel an\u0027 have the daisies a-bloomin\u0027 over my grave, than to have been tuk a prisoner in that house. But that dinner was good, anyhow—what we got of it!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63207.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
