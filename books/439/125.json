{"id":45160,"no":125,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. THE 200TH IND. ASSAULTS THE REBEL WORKS AT DAYBREAK","content":"THERE were the same perplexing sounds of battle in many places and directions when the 200th Ind. went into line as there had been around Buzzard Roost. \\n\\n \\n\\n Joe Johnston was fiercely contesting every hilltop and narrow gorge to gain time to adjust his army to the unexpected movement through Snake Creek Gap, and save the stores he had accumulated behind the heavy fortifications around Dalton. \\n\\n \\n\\n Though they had felt themselves completely worn out by the work with the train, the prospect of a fight put new life into the 200th Ind., and they leaned on their guns and listened to the crackling of musketry and booming of artillery far away to their left, to their right, and apparently in their rear. Sometimes the sounds would come so near that the wave of battle would seem to be surely rolling down on them. Then they would clutch their guns more firmly, and their hands instinctively seek their cartridge-boxes. Then the firing would as inexplicably die down and stop, when they would again sink on the ground with fatigue. \\n\\n \\n\\n So the late afternoon wore on. It grew very quiet all around. Even the dull booming of the cannon far up the valley where Howard and Schofield were advancing on the heavy works immediately in front of Dalton, died down into sullen fitfulness. \\n\\n \\n\\n The silence of the woods and the mountains as night drew on became more oppressive than the crashing sounds, the feverish movements, and the strained expectancy of the day had been. \\n\\n \\n\\n The whip-poor-wills began to fill the evening air with their mournful calls, which accentuated and intensified the weird loneliness of the scene, where but a little while before there had been no thought but of deadly hatred and bitter strife. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I never heard the whip-poor-wills whip so gloomily,\" remarked the sentimental Alf Russell, after the regiment had stacked arms, and the men were resting, exhausted and out of temper, on the ground. \"Seems to me it sounds altogether different from the way they do at home; got something savage in it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Probably they\u0027re yelling their satisfaction over the number of men they\u0027ve seen killed and wounded today,\" ventured Monty Scruggs. \"Does \u0027em good to see men shooting at one another instead of birds.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dumbed little brutes,\" grumbled Shorty, nursing his hurt foot, \"if they\u0027d bin wrastlin\u0027 all day with a mule train they\u0027d be too tired to go yellin\u0027 around like that. I always did hate a whip-poor-will, anyway. They hain\u0027t got sense enough to do anything but yell, jest like a pasel o\u0027 rebel cavalry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Great Scott! I wisht I knowed whether we\u0027re goin\u0027 to stay here tonight,\" said Si, handling his blanket roll with a look of anticipation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said the Orderly, coming down from the right of the regiment. \"We\u0027re to move forward about a mile, and establish a line for the rest of the brigade to form on. We\u0027re to go quietly, without noise or commands, and then bivouac without fires. Get your guns and fall in quietly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As ill-tempered as tired, the boys roused up from the ground, and began taking their guns from the stacks. Harry Joslin snatched his out first, and the stack, falling over, the bayonet points struck Gid Mackall\u0027s face. The angry Gid responded with a blow landed on the side of Harry\u0027s head. In an instant the two clinched, and the others, who were in no better humor, began striking at one another in blind temper. Si and Shorty snatched the two principals apart with a good deal of violence and much show of their own tempers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You long legged sand hill crane,\" said Si, shaking Gid. \"Will you always be kickin\u0027 up a rumpus? I\u0027ll break your neck if you don\u0027t act better.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You senseless little bantam,\" said Shorty, with his grip on Harry\u0027s throat; \"will you always be raising a ruction? Will I have to wring your neck to learn you to behave?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let him alone, Shorty,\" said Si irritably. \"He ain\u0027t to blame. This gangling fly-up the crick started it.\" And he gave Gid another shake. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You let him alone. Si,\" said Shorty crossly. \"I know better. This whelp started it, as he always does. I\u0027ll throw him down and tramp on him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You won\u0027t do nothin\u0027 o\u0027 the kind. Shorty. Don\u0027t you contradict me. Let him go, I tell you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You take your hands off that boy, or I\u0027ll make you, Si Klegg,\" said Shorty hotly. \"I won\u0027t see you imposin\u0027 on somebody\u0027s that\u0027s smaller\u0027n you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The spectacle of the two partners quarreling startled them all. They stopped and looked aghast. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here, what\u0027s all this disorder here,\" said the Orderly, coming up, impetuously, and as cross as any one. \"Why don\u0027t you get into line as ordered? Sergeant Klegg, you\u0027re always making trouble for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t doin\u0027 nothing o\u0027 the kind. What\u0027s the sense o\u0027 your sayin\u0027 sich a thing?\" Si retorted. \"You know it ain\u0027t true.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Si Klegg, be careful how you call me a liar,\" answered the Orderly. \"I\u0027ll—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What in the world does all this mean?\" said Capt. McGillicuddy angrily, as he stepped back to them. \"What are you wasting time squabbling before the men for? Fall into your places at once, and don\u0027t let me hear another word from any of you. Don\u0027t you see the regiment is moving?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027ll finish this later,\" the Orderly whispered to Si, as he went to his place on the right. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll settle with you, Shorty, when I have more time,\" Si remarked as he took his place. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The sooner the better,\" grunted Shorty. \"You can\u0027t run over me, if you are a Sergeant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The wearied men went stumbling along the rough road for what seemed the longest mile ever known. It had grown very dark. At last a form separated itself from the bank of blackness on the left, and a voice said in a penetrating whisper: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is this the 200th Ind?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" answered the Colonel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m Lieut. Snowden, of the General\u0027s staff,\" said the whisper. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; I recognize your voice,\" answered the Colonel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was sent here,\" continued the Whisper, \"to post you when you came up. You will make this your right, and form out there to the left. Do it without the slightest noise. There is a strong force of rebels out there in front. They have a line of works with abatis in front, and a fort on the hill there to the right, as you can see by looking up against the sky. You will not allow any fires to be made or lights to be shown. The other regiments will come up and form on your right and left, and you will be ready to attack and carry the line immediately in front of you the moment that it is light enough to see to move. The signal will be given by the headquarters bugle.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very good,\" replied the Colonel. \"Tell the General that we\u0027ll be ready, and he\u0027ll find us inside the rebel line five minutes after the bugle sounds.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In the meanwhile,\" continue the Aid, \"you will keep a sharp lookout. You may be attacked, and if you see signs of evacuation you are to attack, and the other regiments will support you. The General will come up later and give you further instructions. Good night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The men nearest the Colonel heard plainly all that was said, and it was soon known throughout the regiment. The men seemed to forget their fatigue as they moved alertly but warily into line to the left, and studied intently the sky-line of the rising ground in front. \\n\\n \\n\\n The whip-poor-wills were still calling, but at the flanks and rear of the regiment. None of them called in front. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s full o\u0027 rebels over there; that\u0027s the reason,\" said Si to himself, as he noted this. \"Yes, they\u0027re all at home, and goin\u0027 to shoot,\" he added in a loud whisper. \"Lay down, everybody.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He was none too soon. The tramping through the bushes, and the various noises that bodies of men will make when in motion, had reached the ears of the alert rebels. A dazzling series of flashes ran along the sky-line, and a flight of bullets sang wickedly over the heads of the 200th Ind., striking in the bushes and trees far behind them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t anybody yell! Don\u0027t anybody shoot!\" called the Colonel in a loud whisper, and it was repeated by the line oflficers. \"It will reveal our position. Lie down and keep perfectly quiet. They\u0027re overshooting us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The rebel battery in the fort waked up, and, more to show its good will than anything else, began shelling the surrounding landscape. \\n\\n \\n\\n One of our batteries, a mile or so to the rear, which had not had an opportunity to fire during the day, could not resist this challenge, and began throwing shells at the fort with so fair an aim as to draw the attention of the rebel battery to it. \\n\\n \\n\\n The lurid flashes of the muskets, cannon, and shells revealed a belt of jagged abatis several rods wide covering the entire front of the fort and breastworks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Great Scott!\" muttered Si to himself, for he was not on speaking terms with Shorty, and would not alarm the boys; \"there\u0027s a porcupine nest to git through. How in the Nation are we ever goin\u0027 to do it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Unroll your blankets and lie down on them,\" came down the line from the Colonel. \"Lay your guns beside you. Don\u0027t attempt to stack them. You may attract the attention of the rebels. Everybody keep his place, and be ready to form and move at once.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stop firing. What are you shooting at?\" said a voice of authority in the rebel works. \"Who gave the order to fire?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The men began it themselves,\" said a second voice. \"They heard Yankees moving over there, and commenced shooting at them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How do you know there are any Yankees out there? I don\u0027t believe they have advanced beyond the crest of the hill. I think they are all going down toward Resaca. Haven\u0027t you any pickets out there?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No. We only moved in here this afternoon, and did not know how long we were going to stay. I was ordered to stay here till further orders, to protect the road beyond.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, we haven\u0027t any ammunition to waste firing at uncertainties. There\u0027s enough Yankees in sight all the time for all the bullets we have, without wasting any on imaginary ones. It\u0027ll be time enough for you to begin shooting when you see them coming to the edge of the abatis there. Before they get through that you\u0027ll have time enough to shoot away all the ammunition you have.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to see whether there are any Yankees there,\" said the second voice in the rebel works. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jim, you and Joe go down to the edge of the abatis and see what you can see.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The wearied boys had nearly all fallen asleep on their blankets. Even the noisy artillery duel had not kept Jim Humphreys awake, and Monty Scruggs and Alf Russell followed his example soon after the firing ceased. Then Harry Joslyn and Gid Mackall, spreading their blankets apart for the first time since they had been in the service, sought rest from their fatigue and forgetfulness of their mutual anger. Si and Shorty kept sternly apart. Shorty occupied himself in fixing the blankets comfortably for a nest for little Pete Skidmore, while Si, brooding over the way that Shorty \"had flared up about nothin\u0027 at all,\" and the Orderly-Sergeant\u0027s and Capt. McGillicuddy\u0027s unjust heat to him, had kept his eyes fixed on the skyline beyond, and had listened to the conversation of the rebel officers. It occurred to him that by watching the two rebels come down he might get an idea of a passage through the abatis, which would be useful in the morning. He strained his eyes to catch sight of their movements. \\n\\n \\n\\n He saw two projections against the sky-line, which he knew were the men crossing the works. They separated, and he could make out two black blotches above the level of darkness and moving down the slope. One came almost directly toward him, the other going to the left. It occurred to him to capture one of the men. He would have suggested to Shorty to get the other, but he could not bring himself to speak to his partner. Keeping his eyes fixed on the man directly in front, he slowly wriggled forward without rising. The man was evidently coming cautiously, halting every few steps, and looking and listening. \\n\\n \\n\\n Perfect quiet reigned in the regiment. The men were mostly asleep. Those who were awake were intently watching the hill for some sign of the enemy, or as silently foreboding the happenings of the morrow. \\n\\n \\n\\n Without making the least noise, Si reached the edge of the abatis. There a young tulip tree had been left standing, and its plentiful branches and large leaves made a thick mass of darkness. He rose upright behind, but his foot came down on a dead stick, which broke with a sharp crack. All the blood rushed to his heart. But at the same instant his head had disturbed a whip-poor-will who had taken refuge there from the noise. She flew away with a tumult of plaintive \"whips.\" The rebel in front halted for a long time. Then he apparently concluded that an owl was after the whip-poor-will, and, reassured, came forward. \\n\\n \\n\\n As he had crawled along. Si had felt with his hands that he was on a tolerably beaten path, which ran by the sapling he was now standing behind. He was sure that this led through the abatis, and the rebel was coming down it. The rebel came on so near that Si could hear his breathing, and Si feared he could hear his. The rebel was carrying his gun at a trail in his right hand, and putting all his powers into his eyes and ears to detect signs of the presence of Yankees. He hesitated for a little while before the sapling, and then stepped past it. \\n\\n \\n\\n As he did so Si shot out his right arm and caught him around the neck with so quick and tight a hug that the rebel could not open his mouth to yell. Si raised his arm so as to press the rebel\u0027s jaws together, and with his left hand reached for his gun. The rebel swayed and struggled, but the slender Southerner was no match for the broad-shouldered Indiana boy, whose muscles had been knit by hard work. \\n\\n \\n\\n The struggle was only momentary until Si secured the gun, and the rebel\u0027s muscles relaxed from the stoppage of his breath. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you say a word, or try to, you\u0027re a dead man,\" Si whispered, as he dropped the gun, and substituted his left hand at the man\u0027s throat for his right arm. Taking silence for acquiescence, Si picked up his own gun and started with his prisoner for the Colonel. He walked upright boldly now, for the watchers on the rebel works could not see that there was more than one man in the path. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Colonel ordered Si to bring his prisoner back into a gully some distance behind the line, where he could be interrogated without the sound reaching the men in the works. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where do you belong?\" asked the Colonel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To Kunnel Wheatstone\u0027s Jawjy rijimint.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How many men have you got over there in the works.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, a right smart passul.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you mean by a right smart parcel?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, a good big heap.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What, a thousand?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I reckon so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ten thousand?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I \u0027spects so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Twenty thousand.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mouty likely.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t seem to have a clear idea of numbers. How many regiments have you got over there?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, thar\u0027s Kunnel Wheatstone\u0027s Jawjy rijimint—that\u0027s mine; then thar\u0027s Kunnel Tarrant\u0027s South Carliny rijimint, and then thar\u0027s Kunnel Bird\u0027s Tennessee rijimint, and I don\u0027t mind how many others. They\u0027ve bin comin\u0027 and goin\u0027 all day, and I hain\u0027t paid no attention to \u0027em. I only know that thar\u0027s enough to give yo\u0027uns a wallopin\u0027 if yo\u0027uns only come on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sergeant,\" said the Colonel, \"you did a splendid thing in capturing this man and bringing him to me, but I fear I shall not get as much information out of him as I\u0027d like to. I don\u0027t presume anybody really knows just how many men are over there. We\u0027ve got to jump the works and take the chances on what we find.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027re ready the minute you give the word. Colonel,\" said Si, saluting. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Colonel,\" said Shorty\u0027s voice out of the darkness, \"I\u0027ve brung you one o\u0027 the rebel scouts that was piroutin\u0027 out there. I don\u0027t know as you kin make much out o\u0027 him, though, for the welt I fetched him with my gun bar\u0027l seems to\u0027ve throwed his thinkery out o\u0027 gear, and he can\u0027t talk straight.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And so you got the other one,\" Si started to say to his partner, but then he remembered Shorty\u0027s \"flarin\u0027 up,\" and held his tongue. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t imagine that his \u0027thinkery,\u0027 as you call it, was of much account when it was in order, if it was no better than this other man\u0027s,\" said the Colonel, with a smile. \"Perhaps, if he could think better he wouldn\u0027t be in the rebel army. Sergeant (to the Provost-Sergeant), take charge of these two men. Give them something to eat, and send them to Division Headquarters.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si and Shorty carefully avoided one another on their way back to the company, and declined to discuss their exploits with either the Orderly-Sergeant or Capt. McGillicuddy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go out and git you a rebel for yourself, if you want to know about \u0027em,\" Shorty had snapped at the Orderly. \"There\u0027s plenty more up there on the hill. It\u0027s full of \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As everything now seemed quiet in front, the two partners sat down with their back against trees to catch a little sleep before the momentous movement in the morning. \\n\\n \\n\\n It seemed to Si that he had hardly closed his eyes when the Orderly shook him and whispered an order to help arouse the men and get them into line. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t make the least noise,\" whispered the Orderly. \"I hear the rebels moving around, but we want to jump \u0027em before they know we\u0027re up. The further we can get through that abatis before they discover us, the fewer we\u0027ll have killed. It\u0027s going to be mighty tough work at best, and I wish that we were going over the works now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was the chill gray of the morning, when every man\u0027s spirits and courage are at ebb-tide. For an instant, Si felt his heart sink at the thought of the awful ordeal that confronted them. There came across his mind a swift vision of the peaceful home back in Indiana, with the pleasant fields lying about, over which he used to go on sweet Spring mornings like this and note the flowers that had bloomed over night, and the growth the wheat had made. How sickening to be now starting to open up a hell of pain, wounds, and death. Then his natural courage and will reasserted themselves, and he began rousing the boys, but with a tenderness born of the thought that their hearts would be as low as his in that bleak hour. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jim Humphreys waked up stolidly, and without a word began preparing to fall in. Alf Russell\u0027s and Monty Scruggs\u0027s faces turned ashy after they had fairly awakened, and they picked up their guns with nerveless fingers. \\n\\n \\n\\n Harry Joslyn took the position of a soldier, with his gun at an order, his lips tightly closed, and his eyes fixed on the rebel position, as the spreading light developed it. Sandy Baker fidgeted about at one time tinkering with his gun and equipments, and then stopping half-way in the task he had started and falling into a fit of musing. Little Pete Skidmore wandered about, looking into Si\u0027s and Shorty\u0027s grave faces, and then into others equally solemn, and finding no comfort in any. It was the first time that he heard no joke or quip flash along the forming line to bring cheers or laughter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come, boys,\" said Si, kindly, \"eat your breakfasts. You can\u0027t make no coffee nor fry no meat, but you\u0027d better fill up on cold grub. You\u0027ll need all you can eat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The mention of something to eat seemed to remind Gid Mackall of his usual appetite. He pulled a cracker out of his haversack and bit it, but it seemed distasteful, and he spat the piece out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The orders are,\" said the Orderly-Sergeant in a low tone, as he passed down in front of the company, \"to strip off your bankets, canteens, and haversacks, and pile them. They\u0027ll be in the road in the rush, and catch in going through the abatis.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Orderly,\" said Shorty in his most conciliatory way, \"if you want to do me a favor make Pete Skidmore one of the detail.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t asking suggestions from you,\" said the Orderly, still surly. \"But I shall detail Baker and Skidmore for the duty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys flung their things off with something like desperation in their looks. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was now daylight, but a dense fog prevented seeing more than a few feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We can\u0027t wait any longer,\" said the Colonel. \"Pass the word down the line to move forward. Make no noise till the enemy opens fire. Then everybody push forward as rapidly as possible for the works.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The first fire will probably go over our heads and do little damage,\" said Capt. McGillicuddy, stepping down to the center, so that his whisper could be heard by all. \"It\u0027s always so when men fire downhill. Then, you all want to be careful and fire low, so as to hit as many as possible, and rattle them in their future firing. The more of them we can hit the less of us will be hit afterward. Forward—Guide right!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It seemed as if the crashing of their marching feet was so loud that the rebels on the hill could not fail to hear it, and they held their breaths in painful expectancy of the volley. But they had gotten a rod or more into the entangling brush of the abatis, and were stumbling and crashing amid the baffling branches, before they heard the voice of the previous night command: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ready—Aim—aim low—Fire!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The rebel muskets crashed together in a terrific volley, which generally passed over the heads of the 200th Ind., though a few men fell into the brush with wounds. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si had gone up the path that he had found the night before, and therefore had no struggle with the fallen trees to shake his nerves and disturb his aim. He had calculated upon this. He brought his musket down deliberately and took good aim at the point whence the voice of command had come. As his gun cracked he heard voices cry: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The Kunnel\u0027s shot. Look out for the Kunnel thar.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Another voice immediately spoke up in command: \"Steady, men! Keep cool! Fire low, and give it to the blue-bellied scoundrels!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then broke out a mad rage of death and destruction, in which both sides seemed in the fiercest insanity of murder. The 200th Ind., encouraged by the shouts of their officers, pressed forward through the baffling tree-tops, stumbling, falling, rising again, firing as fast as they could load their guns, and yelling like demons. They were frantic to get through the obstructions and come to hand-to-hand struggle with the fiends who were yelling and firing from the top of the breastworks. \\n\\n \\n\\n The rebel battery in the fort began hurling a tornado of shells as near as they could bring their guns to bear on the yelling. This aroused its enemy battery of the night before, and it opened up viciously. The regiments to the right and left of the 200th Ind. moved forward at the sound of the firing, and added to the dinning turbulence. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si had kept to the path, firing coolly and with deadly aim as he kept pace with the line, which was fiercely forging through the brush. There had gathered behind him Jim Humphreys, Harry Joslyn, and Gid Mackall. The rest had gathered over toward Shorty, who was raging through the abatis, tearing aside the branches which impeded the others, yelling, swearing most horribly, and firing as a loaded gun would be handed him. He happened to look around to see who was handing him guns, and saw that it was Pete Skidmore and Sandy Baker. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I thought you little brats was ordered to stay behind with the things,\" he gasped. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know we was,\" whimpered little Pete as he capped a gun and handed it to Shorty; \"but we couldn\u0027t stay when we heard the yelling and shooting. We was so scared that we was afraid to stay there, so we hunted you up, and—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come on, boys,\" yelled Shorty to the others. \"Go ahead. We\u0027re almost through, and then we\u0027ll salivate them whelps of damnation.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A bullet came so nigh Si\u0027s face that it seemed to burn him, and then he heard it strike. Jim Humphreys fell without a groan—a bullet through his brain. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t mind that. Forward, boys,\" shouted Si. \"Here\u0027s the end of the abatis.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Gid Mackall fell, and Harry Joslyn turned to help him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t mind him. Come on,\" Si called over his shoulder, as he rushed in the clear place, just at the edge of the shallow ditch in front of the works. \"Everybody this way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Charge Thru the Abatis. 211 \\n\\n \\n\\n All that was left of the regiment was now through the abatis. The fog suddenly lifted, and showed the combatants face to face, with only the ditch and the bank of earth between them. The sight was so startling that both sides paused for an instant. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Forward, 200th Ind.! Rally on your colors!\" rang out the clear, sweet, penetrating voice of the Colonel, as he snatched the colors from the hand of the third man who had borne them since the regiment moved forward, and sprang up the side of the works. \\n\\n \\n\\n Of the pandemonium that reigned inside the rebel works for the next few minutes Si only recollected seeing the Orderly-Sergeant, bareheaded, and with bayonet fixed, leap down from the bank and transfix a man who tried to snatch the flag from the Colonel\u0027s hand. Si arrived just in time to shoot the rebel officer who was striking at the Orderly with his sword, while Shorty came up, knocking down a winrow of men with his gun swung by the butt as a club, to rescue Si from three rebels who were trying to bayonet him. \\n\\n \\n\\n All at once the entire rebel line broke and ran down the hill in a wave of dingy brown, while another wave of blue rolled over the works to the right and left of the 200th Ind. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope you ain\u0027t hurt, Orderly,\" said Si, dropping the butt of his musket on the ground, and wiping his flushed face. \"I thought that officer was goin\u0027 to git you, sure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He would, if it hadn\u0027t been for you, Si. He got in one slash on me, but it ain\u0027t much, I think. But Shorty helped you out of a tight box.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; Shorty generally does that,\" said Si, with a beaming look on his partner. \"He\u0027s the best soldier in the regiment, and kin always be trusted to git in on time anywhere.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m afraid it \u0027ll be a short roll I\u0027ll have to call this evening,\" said the Orderly, with a sorrowful expression. \"I suppose we\u0027d better go back through that brush and look up the boys that were dropped.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63312.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
