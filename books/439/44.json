THE DEACON BUTTS IN","content":"ENFORCES THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION. \n \n \"PAP,\" said Si, as they were riding back, comfortably seated on a load of corn-fodder, \"now that it\u0027s all over, I\u0027m awfully scared about you. I can\u0027t forgive myself for runnin\u0027 you up agin such a scrape. I hadn\u0027t no idee that there wuz a rebel in the whole County. If anything had happened you it\u0027d just killed mother and the girls, and then I\u0027d never rested till I got shot myself, for I wouldn\u0027t wanted to live a minute.\" \n \n \"Pshaw, my son,\" responded his father rather testily; \"you ain\u0027t my guardeen, and I hope it\u0027ll be a good many years yit before you are. I\u0027m mighty glad that I went. There was something Providential in it. I\u0027m a good deal of a Quaker. I believe in the movin\u0027s of the spirit. The spirit moved me very strongly to go with you, and I now see the purpose in it. If I hadn\u0027t, them fellers might\u0027ve got the bulge on you. I seen them before any o\u0027 you did, and I fetched down their head devil, and I feel that I helped you a good deal.\" \n \n \"Indeed you did,\" said Shorty earnestly. \"You ought to have a brevet for your \u0027conspicuous gallantry in action.\u0027 I think the Colonel will give you one. You put an ounce o\u0027 lead to particularly good245 use in that feller\u0027s karkiss. I only wish it\u0027d bin a little higher up, where it\u0027d a measured him for a wooden overcoat.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m awful glad I hit him jest where I did,\" responded the Deacon. \"I did have his heart covered with my sights, and then I pulled down a little. He was pizen, I know; but I wanted to give him a chance to repent.\" \n \n \"He\u0027ll repent a heap,\" said Shorty incredulously. \"He\u0027ll lay around the house for the next six months, studyin\u0027 up new deviltry, and what he can\u0027t think of that secesh mother o\u0027 his\u0027ll put him up to. Co. Q, and particularly the Hoosier\u0027s Rest, is the only place you\u0027ll find a contrite heart and a Christian spirit cultivated.\" \n \n \"That reminds me,\" said Si; \"we hain\u0027t licked the Wagonmaster yit for throwin\u0027 cartridges down our chimbley.\" \n \n \"Blamed if that ain\u0027t so,\" said Shorty. \"I knowed I\u0027d forgotten some little thing. It\u0027s bin hauntin\u0027 my mind for days. I\u0027ll jest tie a knot in my handker chief to remember that I must tend to that as soon\u0027s we git back.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m quite sure that I don\u0027t want another sich a tussle,\" meditated the Deacon. \"I never heerd any thing sound so murderin\u0027 wicked as them bullets. A painter\u0027s screech on a dark night or a rattler\u0027s rattle wuzzent to be compared to \u0027em. It makes my blood run cold to think o\u0027 \u0027em. Then, if that feller that shot at me had wobbled his gun a little to the left, Josiah Klegg\u0027s name would \u0027ve bin sculped on a slab o\u0027 white marble, and Maria would \u0027ve bin the Widder Klegg. I wish the war wuz over, and Si and Shorty246 safe at home. But their giddy young pates are so full o\u0027 dumbed nonsense that there hain\u0027t no room for scare. But, now that I\u0027m safe through it, I wouldn\u0027t \u0027ve missed it for the best cow on my place. After all, Providence sends men where they are needed, and He certainly sent me out there. \n \n \"Then, I\u0027ll have a good story to tell the brethren and sisters some night after prayer meetin\u0027s over. It\u0027ll completely offset that story \u0027bout my comin\u0027 so near gittin\u0027 my head shaved. How the ungodly247 rapscallions would\u0027ve gloated over Deacon Klegg\u0027s havin\u0027 his head shaved an\u0027 bein\u0027 drummed out o\u0027 camp. That thing makes me shiver worse\u0027n the whistlin\u0027 o\u0027 them awful bullets. But they can\u0027t say nothin\u0027 now. Deacon Klegg\u0027s bin a credit to the church.\" \n \n They were nearing camp. The Captain of Co. Q ordered: \n \n \"Corporal Klegg, take your wagon up that right-hand road to the Quartermaster\u0027s corral of mules, and bring me a receipt for it.\" \n \n Si turned the wagon off, and had gone but a few hundred yards, when he and Shorty saw a house at a little distance, which seemed to promise to furnish something eatable. He and Shorty jumped off and cut across the fields toward it, telling the Deacon they would rejoin him before he reached the picket-line, a mile or so ahead. \n \n The Deacon jogged on, musing intently of the stirring events of the day, until he was recalled to the things immediately around him by hearing a loud voice shout: \n \n \"Stop, there, you black scoundrel! I\u0027ve ketched ye. I\u0027m gwine to blow your onery head off.\" \n \n He looked up and saw a man about his own age, dressed in butternut homespun, and riding a fine horse. He wore a broad-brimmed slouch hat, his clean-shaven face was cold and cruel, and he had leveled a double-barreled shotgun on a fine-looking negro, who had leaped over from the field into the middle of the road, and was standing there regard ing him with a look of intense disappointment and248 fear. \n \n I\u0027m Gwine Ter Kill Ye, Right Here 246 \n \n \"You devil\u0027s ape,\" continued the white man, with a torrent of profanity, \"I\u0027ve ketched ye jest in the nick o\u0027 time. Ye wuz makin\u0027 for the Yankee camp, and \u0027d almost got thar. Ye thought yer 40 acres and a mule wuz jest in sight, did ye? Mebbe ye reckoned y\u0027d git a white wife, and be an officer in the Yankee army. I\u0027m gwine to kill ye, right here, to stop yer deviltry, and skeer off others that air o\u0027 the same mind.\" \n \n \"Pray God, don\u0027t kill me, massa,\" begged the negro. \"I hain\u0027t done nuffin\u0027 to be killed foh.\" \n \n \"Hain\u0027t done nothin\u0027 to be killed for!\" shouted the white man, with more oaths. \"Do ye call sneakin\u0027 off to jine the enemy and settin\u0027 an example to the other niggers nothin\u0027? Git down on yer knees and say yer prayers, if ye know any, for ye ain\u0027t a minnit to live.\" \n \n The trembling negro dropped to his knees and be gan mumbling his prayers. \n \n \"What\u0027s the matter here?\" asked the Deacon of the teamster. \n \n \"O, some man\u0027s ketched his nigger tryin\u0027 to run away to our lines, an\u0027s goin\u0027 to kill him,\" answered the teamster indifferently. \n \n \"Goin\u0027 to kill him,\" gasped the Deacon. \"Are we goin\u0027 to \u0027low that?\" \n \n \"\u0027Tain\u0027t none o\u0027 my business,\" said the teamster coolly. \"It\u0027s his nigger; I reckon he\u0027s a right to do as he pleases.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t reckon nothin\u0027 o\u0027 the kind,\" said the Deacon indignantly. \"I won\u0027t stand and see it done.\" \n \n \"Better not mix in,\" admonished the teamster. \"Them air Southerners is pretty savage folks, and249 don\u0027t like any meddlin\u0027 twixt them and their niggers. What\u0027s a nigger, anyway?\" \n \n \"Amounts to about as much as a white-livered teamster,\" said the Deacon hotly. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to mix in. I\u0027ll not see any man murdered while I\u0027m around. Say, you,\" to the white man; \"what are you goin\u0027 ter do with that man?\" \n \n \"Mind yer own bizniss,\" replied the white man, after a casual glance at the Deacon, and seeing that he did not wear a uniform. \"Keep yer mouth shet if ye know when y\u0027re well off.\" \n \n \"O, massa, save me! save me!\" said the negro, jumping up and running toward the Deacon, who had slipped down from the fodder, and was standing in the road. \n \n \"All right, Sambo; don\u0027t be scared. He sha\u0027n\u0027t kill you while I\u0027m around,\" said the Deacon. \n \n \"I tell ye agin to mind yer own bizniss and keep yer mouth shet,\" said the white man savagely. \"Who air ye, anyway? One o\u0027 them sblinkin\u0027 nigger-stealin\u0027 Abolitionists, comin\u0027 down here to rob us Southerners of our property?\" \n \n He followed this with a torrent of profane denunciation of the \"whole Abolition crew.\" \n \n \"Look here, Mister,\" said the Deacon calmly, reaching back into the wagon and drawing out a musket, \"I\u0027m a member o\u0027 the church and a peaceable man. But I don\u0027t \u0027low no man to call me names, and I object to swearin\u0027 of all kinds. I want to argy this question with you, quietly, as between man and man.\" \n \n He looked down to see if there was a cap on the gun.250 \n \n \"What\u0027s the trouble \u0027twixt you and this man here?\" \n \n \"That ain\u0027t no man,\" said the other hotly. \"That\u0027s my nigger bought with my money. He\u0027s my property. I\u0027ve ketched him tryin\u0027 to run away tryin\u0027 to rob me of $1,200 worth o\u0027 property and give it to our enemies. I\u0027m gwine to kill him to stop others from doin\u0027 the same thing.\" \n \n \"Indeed you\u0027re not,\" said the Deacon, putting his thumb on the hammer. \n \n \"Do you mean to say you\u0027ll stop me?\" said the master, starting to raise his shotgun, which he had let fall a little. \n \n \"Something like that, if not the exact words,\" an swered the Deacon calmly, looking at the sights of the musket with an interested air. \n \n The master resumed his volley of epithets. \n \n The Deacon\u0027s face became very rigid, and the musket was advanced to a more threatening position. \"I told you before,\" he said, \"that I didn\u0027t allow no man to call me sich names. I give you warnin\u0027 agin. I\u0027m liable to fall from grace, as the Methodists say, any minnit. I\u0027m dumbed sure to if you call me an other name.\" \n \n The master glared at the musket. It was clearly in hands used to guns, and the face behind it was not that of a man to be fooled with beyond a certain limit. He lowered his shotgun, and spoke sharply to the negro: \n \n \"Sam, git \u0027round here in front of the hoss, and put for home at once.\" \n \n \"Stay where you are, till I finish talkin\u0027 to this man,\" commanded the Deacon. \"Are you a loyal man?\" he inquired of the master.251 \n \n \"If ye mean loil to that rail-splittin\u0027 gorilla in Washington,\" replied the master, hotly; \"to that low-down, nigger-lovin\u0027, nigger-stealin\u0027—\" \n \n \"Shet right up,\" said the Deacon, bringing up his gun in a flash of anger. \"You sha\u0027n\u0027t abuse the President o\u0027 the United States any more\u0027n you shall me, nor half so much. He\u0027s your President, whom you must honor and respect. I won\u0027t have him blackguarded by an unhung rebel. You say yourself you\u0027re a rebel. Then you have no right whatever to this man, and I\u0027m goin\u0027 to confiscate him in the name o\u0027 Abraham Lincoln, President o\u0027 the United States, an\u0027 accordin\u0027 to his proclamation of emancipation, done at Washington, District o\u0027 Columbia, in the year of our Lord eighteen hundred and sixty-three and of our Independence the 87th. \n \n \"Now, you jest turn your hoss around and vacate these parts as quick as you can, and leave me and this colored man alone. We\u0027re tired o\u0027 havin\u0027 you \u0027round.\" \n \n The master was a man of sense. He knew that there was nothing to do but obey. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63231.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
