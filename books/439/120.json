SHORTY GIVES THE BOYS THEIR FIRST LESSON IN FORAGING.","content":"\n WITH the elasticity of youth the boys slept away their fatigue during the night, but woke up the next morning ravenously hungry. \n \n \"What in the world are we goin\u0027 to do for grub, Si?\" asked Shorty, as soon as he got his eyes fairly open. \n \n \"Oi know what Oi\u0027m goin\u0027 to do,\" said Hennessey. \"Oi\u0027m goin to show the foinest pace av shprinting back to camp that has been sane in these parts since our roight bruk that day at Chickamaugy. No grass\u0027ll grow under me fate, Oi tell yez. And as I pass through your camp Oi\u0027ll foind yer Captain, and tell the fix you\u0027re in, and to sind out some rations.\" \n \n \"But even if he does send them at once, they can\u0027t git here till evenin\u0027, and I hate powerfully to let him and the rest know that we didn\u0027t have sense enough to take care o\u0027 our victuals after we\u0027d drawed \u0027em,\" said Si. \n \n \"If it was only one, or even two days, I\u0027d let the boys starve it out, as a good lesson to \u0027em,\" said Shorty. \"But three seems like cruelty to dumb beasts.\" \n \n \"But what\u0027ll they say about us in camp?\" groaned Si. \"They\u0027ll have the grand laugh on me and you, and every one o\u0027 the boys. I\u0027d ruther go on quarter rations for a month than stand the riggin\u0027 they\u0027ll give us, and have Capt. McGillicuddy give me one look when he asks the question about how we come to lose all our rations so soon? He\u0027ll think me a purty Sarjint to send out into the country in charge o\u0027 men, and you a fine Corpril.\" \n \n \"Say,\" said Shorty, his face illuminated with a bright idea. \"We might report the rations \u0027lost in action.\u0027 That\u0027d fix it fine. We had two good fights, and come out ahead. That\u0027ll tickle the Captain so that he won\u0027t be partickler what we report.\" \n \n \"Hurroo!\" echoed Hennessey; \"that\u0027s the ticket.\" \n \n \"But we didn\u0027t lose \u0027em in action, and to say so\u0027d be a lie,\" answered Si, whose conscience had none of the easy elasticity of his partner\u0027s. \"We could report \u0027em burnt up by lightnin\u0027,\u0027but we won\u0027t. They was lost by sheer, dumbed carelessness, that me and you and the boys should knowed better than to\u0027ve allowed. That\u0027s all there is of it, and that\u0027s what I\u0027m goin\u0027 to report, if I have to.\" \n \n \"Great Jehosephat,\" exploded Shorty; \"you kin certainly be the stubbornest mule over nothin\u0027, Si Klegg, that I ever seen. We\u0027ve done fightin\u0027 enough to excuse sich a report, or any that we\u0027ve a mind to make.\" \n \n \"Nothin\u0027 kin justify a lie,\" persisted the obdurate Si. \n \n \"Holy smoke! bigger men than you—lots bigger—have squared up their accounts that way. Didn\u0027t all the Captains in the rijiment, and the Quartermaster and Commissary, and, for what I know, the Chaplain and the Colonel, git clean bills o\u0027 health after the battle o\u0027 Stone River, by reportin\u0027 everything that they couldn\u0027t find \u0027lost in action?\u0027\" \n \n \"Yis,\" added Hennessey, \"and didn\u0027t my Captain, after Chickamaugy, git us all new uniforms and complete kits, by reportin\u0027 iverything \u0027lost in action?\u0027 Smart man, my Captain, Oi tell yez.\" \n \n \"Well, I don\u0027t think any the more o\u0027 them for it. We spiled our rations before the fightin\u0027 begun, they\u0027d bin spiled if there\u0027d bin no fightin\u0027, and I haint going to send no other words, if I\u0027ve got to send any word.\" \n \n \"Who the divil\u0027s goin\u0027 to carry this word, Oi\u0027d like to know, Misther Klegg?\" broke in Hennessey. \"Are you goin\u0027 to put words into my mouth, Misther Klegg? Oi\u0027ll tell your Captain just fwhat Oi plaze, about you and your foight and your rations. Oi want no more worrids wid ye. Attintion, min! Shoulder, a-r-m-s! Roight face! Forward, foile left!—M-a-r-c-h!\" \n \n \"I s\u0027pose I ain\u0027t responsible for any o\u0027 the fairy tales with which that wild Mick\u0027ll fill up the Captain,\" said Si, self-consolingly, as Hennessey and his squad marched away in quick time. \"He\u0027ll put a rich, red, County Connaught color on everything that\u0027s happened out here, and the Captain\u0027ll believe as much as suits him. Anyhow, Hennessey\u0027ll not say anything to our disadvantage, and probably the Captain\u0027ll send out some rations by fast mule express.\" \n \n \"Yes,\" accorded Shorty; \"we\u0027ll git some rations from camp by this evenin\u0027. Cap will look out for that. Meanwhile, I\u0027ll take out two or three o\u0027 the boys on a scout into the country, to see if we can\u0027t pick up something to eat.\" \n \n \"Humph,\" said Si, skeptically, \"you\u0027ll find mighty poor pickin\u0027, after them Ohio boys \u0027s bin out here three days. What they haint taken has been rooted in the ground.\" \n \n \"Yes; they\u0027re awful foragers and thieves,\" assented Shorty. \"All Ohio boys is. I\u0027m glad I\u0027m from Injianny. Still, I\u0027ve generally bin able to find something, even after the Ohio boys had bin there.\" \n \n \"Well, I think we\u0027d better first go back and see about them rebels that we wounded last night. They may be sufferin\u0027 awfully, and we oughtn\u0027t to think about something to eat, before doin\u0027 what we kin for them.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s so,\" assented Shorty. \"I\u0027d a-gone back last night, but we was all so dead tired.\" \n \n \"Well, I\u0027ll take two o\u0027 the boys and go back. You stay here with the rest, and hold the mill. I\u0027ll git back as soon\u0027s I kin, and then you kin take a couple o\u0027 the boys and go out foragin\u0027.\" \n \n Calling Alf Russell and Monty Scruggs to follow him, Si started back to the scene of the skirmish of the night before. The woods looked totally different, under the bright Spring sunshine, from what they had seemed in the chill, wet blackness of the previous night. Buds were bursting and birds singing, and all nature seemed very blithe and inspiring. \n \n \"Gracious, what a difference daylight makes in the woods,\" murmured Monty Scruggs. \"Tain\u0027t a bit like Hohenlinden. \n \n \"\u0027Tis morn, but scarce yon lurid sun \n Can pierce the war-clouds rolling dun, \n Where furious Frank and fiery Hun \n Shout \u0027mid their sulphurous canopy.\" \n \n \"You\u0027d think, from the way the bird \u0027s singing, and the flowers blooming, that there\u0027d never been a gun fired within a hundred miles o\u0027 here.\" \n \n \"Seems like we only dreamed all that happened last night,\" accorded Alf Russell. \"There\u0027s nothing in the woods or the ground that looks as it did then, and I can\u0027t hardly make myself believe that this is the way we come.\" \n \n \"Well, here\u0027s something that\u0027ll convince you it wasn\u0027t a dream,\" said Si, as they made their way through the broken and trampled brush, and came to a little knoll, on which the final fight had been made, and where were gathered the wounded rebels. There were three of these; the man whom Shorty had shot in the shoulder, the one whom Si knocked down by a stunning blow on the head, and the one who had been hit in the thigh by a shot from the boys, and who was the \"pardner\" of the recalcitrant man of the previous evening. He was still there, caring for his comrades. The men who had been shot were so faint from loss of blood that they could scarcely move, and the man whom Si had struck was only slowly recovering consciousness. \n \n The unhurt rebel was standing there with his gun in hand, and had apparently been watching their approach for some time. \n \n \"My parole was out at daylight,\" he said, as they came up. \"The sun\u0027s now nearly an hour high. I ain\u0027t obleeged to be good no more, and I could\u0027 \u0027ve drapped one o\u0027 yo\u0027uns when y\u0027 fust turned offen the road, and got away. I s\u0027pose I\u0027d orter\u0027ve done hit, and I\u0027d a great mind ter, but suthin\u0027 sorter held me back. Onderstand that?\" \n \n \"You\u0027d a\u0027 bin a nice man to\u0027ve shot at us when we wuz comin\u0027 to help your comrades,\" said Si, walking up coolly toward him, and getting near enough to prevent his leveling his gun, while he held his own ready for a quick blow with the barrel. \"We needn\u0027t\u0027ve come back here at all, except that we felt it right to take care o\u0027 the men that got hurt.\" \n \n \"Come back to take keer o\u0027 the men that yo\u0027uns swatted last night?\" said the rebel incredulously. \"That haint natural. \u0027Taint Yankee-like. What\u0027d yo\u0027uns keer for \u0027em, \u0027cept to see if they\u0027uns\u0027s dead yit, and mebbe gin \u0027em a prod with the bayonit to help \u0027em along? But they\u0027uns\u0027s mouty nigh dead, now. They\u0027uns can\u0027t last much longer. But I\u0027ll kill the fust one o\u0027 yo\u0027uns that tries to prod one o\u0027 they\u0027uns with a bayonit. Let they\u0027uns alone. They\u0027ll soon be gone.\" \n \n \"What\u0027re you talkin\u0027 about, you dumbed fool?\" said Si, irritably. \"We haint no Injuns nor heathens, to kill wounded men. We\u0027re Injiannians and Christians, what read the Bible, and foller what it says about lovin\u0027 your enemies, and carin\u0027 for them what despitefully use you—that is, after you\u0027ve downed \u0027em good and hard.\" \n \n \"Does your Bible say that ere?\" asked the rebel. \n \n \"Yes, indeed.\" \n \n \"Well, hit must be a new-fangled kind of a Yankee Bible. The only Bible I ever seed was a piece o\u0027 one that used t\u0027 be in dad\u0027s house, and I\u0027ve done heared strangers read hit aloud hundreds o\u0027 times, and hit said nothin\u0027 like that. Hit had lots in it \u0027bout killin\u0027 every man and man-child, and hewin\u0027 \u0027em to pieces afore the Lord, but nothin\u0027 \u0027bout lovin\u0027 and takin\u0027 keer o\u0027 them that wuz fernest ye.\" \n \n \"Well, it\u0027s in there, all the same,\" said Si impatiently, \"and you must mind it, same\u0027s we do. Come, drop that gun, and help us take care o\u0027 these men. They ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to die. We won\u0027t let \u0027em. They\u0027re all right. Just faint from loss o\u0027 blood. We kin fix \u0027em up. Set your gun agin\u0027 that beech there, and go to the branch and git some water to wash their wounds, and we\u0027ll bring \u0027em around all right.\" \n \n There was something so masterful in Si\u0027s way, that the rebel obeyed. Si set his own gun down against a hickory, in easy reach, and had the boys do the same. He had naturally gained a good deal of knowledge of rough surgery in the army, and he proceeded to put it to use. He washed the wounds, stayed the flow of blood, and to take the rising fever out of the hurts, he bound on them fresh, green dockleaves, wet with water. After the man he had struck had had his face washed, and his head thoroughly doused with cold water, he recovered rapidly and was soon able to sit up, and then rise weakly to his feet. \n \n The rebel looked on wonderingly. \n \n \"Well, yo\u0027uns is as good doctrin\u0027 hurts as ole Sary Whittleton, and she\u0027s a natural bone-setter,\" he said. \n \n \"Well, don\u0027t stand around and gawk,\", said Si snappishly. \"Help. What\u0027s your name?\" \n \n \"Gabe Brimster.\" \n \n \"Well, Gabe, go down to the branch and git some more water, quick as you kin move them stumps o\u0027 your\u0027n. Give the men all they want to drink, and then pour some on their wounds. Then go there and cut some o\u0027 them pawpaws, and peel their bark, to make a litter to carry your pardner back to the mill. Boys, look around for guns. Smash all you kin find on that rock there, so they won\u0027t be of no more use. Bust the locks good, and bend the barrels. Save two to make the handles of the litter.\" \n \n Si proceeded to deftly construct a litter out of the two guns, with some sticks that he cut with a knife, and bound with pawpaw strips. \n \n A few days before, Si, while passing near the hospital, saw a weak convalescent faint and fall. He rushed to the Surgeon\u0027s tent, and that officer being busy, handed him a small bottle with a metal top, and filled with strong ammonia, telling him to unscrew the top and hold the bottle under the man\u0027s nose. He did so, with the effect of reviving him. Si thrust the bottle into his pocket, to help the man back to the hospital, and forgot all about it, until one after another of his present patients overdid himself, had a relapse, and fainted away. Si happened to feel his bottle, drew it out, unscrewed the top, thrust it under their noses, and revived them. \n \n Gabs\u0027s eyes opened wider at each performance. He had never seen a bottle with a metal top, or one that unscrewed, or anything that seemed to effect such wonderful changes by merely pointing it at a man. His mountaineer intellect, prone to \"spells\" and \"charms,\" saw in it at once an instrument of morta: witchcraft. With a paling face, he began edging toward his gun. Busy as Si had been, he had kept constantly in mind the possibility of Gabe\u0027s attempting some mischief, and did not let himself lose sight of the rebel\u0027s gun. He quickly rose, and with a few strides, placed himself between Gabe and his gun. \n \n Mr. Yank, Don\u0027t Conjure Me. 135 \n \n \"Where are you goin\u0027?\" he said sternly. \n \n \"I\u0027m a-gwine away,\" replied the man, in terror-stricken accents. \"I\u0027m a-gwine away mouty quick. I don\u0027t want to stay here no longer.\" \n \n \"Indeed you\u0027re not goin\u0027 away. You\u0027ll stay right with us, and help us take care o\u0027 your comrades.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m a-gwine away, I tell y\u0027,\" shrieked Gabe. \"I\u0027m gwine right away. I\u0027m skeered o\u0027 yo\u0027uns. Yo\u0027uns is no doctor, nor no sojer. Yo\u0027uns is a conjure-man, and a Yankee conjure-man, too—wust kind. Yo\u0027uns \u0027ve bin puttin\u0027 spells on them men, and yo\u0027uns\u0027ll put a spell on me. I\u0027ve felt hit from the fust. I\u0027m a-gwine away. Le\u0027me go, quick.\" \n \n Si caught the man roughly by the shoulder with his left hand, and raised his right threateningly. It still had the bottle in it. \"You\u0027re not goin\u0027 a step, except with us,\" he said. \"Go back there, and \u0027tend to your business as I told you, or I\u0027ll break you in two.\" \n \n The sight of the dreadful bottle pointed at him completely unnerved the rebel. He fell on his knees. \n \n \"O, Mister Yank—Mister Conjure-man! don\u0027t put no spell on me. Pray to God, don\u0027t! I had one on me wunst, when I was little, and liked to\u0027ve died from hit. I haint no real rebel. I wuz conscripted into the army, or I wouldn\u0027t be foutin\u0027 yo\u0027uns. I won\u0027t fout no more, if yo\u0027uns\u0027ll not put a spell on me. \u0027Deed I won\u0027t! I swar to God I wont!\" \n \n And he raised his right hand in testimony. \n \n \"Put a spell on you? Conjure you? What dumbed nonsense!\" ejaculated Si, and then his eyes caught the rebel\u0027s fastened on the bottle in his hand, and a gleam of the meaning entered his mind. He had no conception of the dread the mountaineers have of being \"conjured,\" but he saw that something about the bottle was operating terrifically on the rebel\u0027s mind and took advantage of it. He was in too much of a hurry to inquire critically what it was, but said: \"Well, I won\u0027t do nothin\u0027 to you, so long\u0027s you\u0027re good, but mind that you\u0027re mighty good, and do just as I say, or I\u0027ll fix you. Git up, now, and take hold o\u0027 your pardner\u0027s feet, and help me lift him on the litter. Then you take hold o\u0027 the front handles. Monty, throw your gun-sling over your shoulder, and take hold o\u0027 the rear handles. The two o\u0027 you carry this man back. Alf, throw your gun-sling over your shoulder, put your arm under this man\u0027s, and help him along. I\u0027ll help this man.\" \n \n They slowly made their way back toward the mill. As they came on the crest of the last rise, they saw Shorty and the rest eagerly watching for them. Shorty and the others ran forward and helped them bring the men in. Shorty was particularly helpful to the man he had shot. He almost carried him in to the mill, handling him as tenderly as if a child, fixed a comfortable place for him on the floor with his own blankets, and took the last grains of his coffee to make him a cup. This done, he said: \n \n \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 out into the country to try and find some chickens to make some broth for you men. Come along, Harry Joslyn, Gid Mackall and little Pete.\" \n \n The country roundabout was discouragingly poor, and had been thoroughly foraged over. But Shorty had a scent for cabins that were hidden away from the common roads, and so escaped the visitations of ordinary foragers. These were always miserably poor, but generally had a half-dozen chickens running about, and a small store of cornmeal and sidemeat. Ordinarily he would have passed one of these in scorn, because to take any of their little store would starve the brood of unkempt children that always abounded. But now, they were his hope. He had been playing poker recently with his usual success, and as the bets were in Confederate money, he had accumulated quite a wad of promises to \"Pay in gold, six months after the ratification of a Treaty of Peace between the Confederate States and the United States.\" He would make some mountaineer family supremely happy by giving them more money than they had ever seen in their lives, in exchange for their stock of meal, chickens and sidemeat. They would know where to get more, and so the transaction would be a pleasant one all around. \n \n In the meanwhile, little Pete had visions of killing big game in the mountain woods. The interminable forest suggested to him dreams of bear, deer, buffalo, elk, and all the animals he had read about. It would be a great thing to bring down an elk or a deer with his Springfield rifle, and then be escorted back\u0027 to camp in triumph, with the other boys carrying his game. He kept circling through the woods, in sight or hearing of the others, expecting every minute to come upon some animal that would fill his youthful sanguine hopes. \n \n Shorty at last found a poor little cabin such as he had been looking for. It was hidden away in a little cove, and had never been visited by the men of either army. It had the usual occupants—a weak-eyed, ague-smitten man, who was so physically worthless that even the rebel conscripters rejected him; a tall, gaunt woman, with a vicious shrillness in her voice and a pipe in her mouth; a half score of mangy yellow dogs, and an equal number of wild, long-haired, staring children. They had a little \"jag\" of meal in a bag, a piece of sidemeat, and a half-dozen chickens. The man had that morning shot an opossum, lean from its Winter fasting. Shorty rejected this contemptuously. \n \n \"I\u0027ve bin mighty hungry in my time,\" said he, \"but I never got quite so low down as to eat anything with a tail like a rat. That\u0027d turn my stummick if I was famishin\u0027.\" \n \n The man looked on Shorty\u0027s display of wealth with lack-luster eyes, but his wife was fascinated, and quickly closed up a deal which conveyed to Shorty all the food that they had. Just as Shorty had completed payment, there came a shot from little Pete\u0027s rifle, and the next instant that youth appeared at the edge of the cornpatch extending up hill from the cabin, hatless, and yelling at the top of his voice. Shorty and the others picked up their guns and took position behind the trees. \n \n \"What\u0027s the matter, Pete?\" asked Shorty, as the boy came up, breathless from his long run. \"Rebels out there?\" \n \n \"No,\" gasped Pete. \"I was hunting out there for a deer, or a elk, or a bear, when suddenly I come acrost the queerest kind of an animal. It looked more like a hog than anything else, yet it wasn\u0027t a hog, for it was thinner\u0027n a cat. It had long white tusks, longer\u0027n your hand, that curled up from its mouth, little eyes that flashed fire, and great long bristles on his back, that stood straight up. I shot at it and missed it, and then it run straight at me. I made for the fence as hard as I could, but it outrun me and was gaining on me every jump. Just as I clim the fence it a-most ketched me, and made a nip not six inches from my leg. I could hear him gnash them awful tusks o\u0027 his\u0027n.\" \n \n \"Humph,\" said the woman. \"He\u0027s run acrost Stevenson\u0027s old boar, that runs in them woods up thar, and is mouty savage this time o\u0027 year. He\u0027d take a laig offen a youngster quicker\u0027n scat, if he ketched him. He done well to run.\" \n \n Shorty and the others walked up to the fence and looked over. There was the old razor-back King of the woods still raging around sniffing the air of combat. \n \n \"Why, it\u0027s only a hog, Pete!\" said Shorty. \n \n \"Only a hog!\" murmured Pete with shamed heart. \n \n \"That a hog?\" echoed the others. \"Well, that\u0027s the queerest looking hog I ever saw.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s a hog all the same,\" Shorty assured them. \"A genuine razor-back hog. But he\u0027s got the secession devil in him like the people, and you want to be careful of him. He ain\u0027t fit to eat or I\u0027d kill him. Let\u0027s git back to the mill.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63307.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
