{"id":45136,"no":101,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. GUARDING THE KNIGHTS","content":"SI AND SHORTY STAND OFF A MOB AT THE JAIL. HAVING seen their prisoners safely behind the bars, Si and Shorty breathed more freely than they had since starting out in the morning, and Si remarked, as he folded up the receipt for them and placed it in his pocket-book: \"That drove\u0027s safely marketed, without the loss of a runaway or a played-out. Purty good job o\u0027 drovin\u0027, that. Pap couldn\u0027t do better\u0027n that with his hogs. I\u0027m hungrier\u0027n a wolf. So must you be, Shorty. Le\u0027s hunt up Maria, and she\u0027ll take us where we kin git a square meal. Then we kin talk. I\u0027ve got a hundred questions I want to ask you, but ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to do it on an empty gizzard. Come on.\" Shorty had dropped on to a bench, and fixed his eyes on the stone wall opposite, as if desperately striving to read there some hint of extrication from his perplexities. The thought of encountering Maria\u0027s bright eyes, and seeing there even more than her sharp tongue would express, numbed his heart. \"Yit, how kin I git away from Si, now?\" he murmured to himself. \"And yit I\u0027m so dead hungry to see her again that I\u0027d be willin\u0027 to be a\u0027most skinned alive to do it. Was ever anybody else so big a fool about a girl? I\u0027ve plagued other fellers, and now I\u0027ve got it worse\u0027n anybody else. It\u0027s a judgment on me. But, then, nobody else ever seen such a girl as that. There\u0027s some sense in bein\u0027 a fool about her.\" \"Come on, Shorty,\" called Si from the door. \"What are you dreamin\u0027 on? Are you too tired to move? Come on. We\u0027ll have a good wash, that\u0027ll take away some of the tiredness, then a big dinner, and a good bed tonight. Tomorrer mornin\u0027 we\u0027ll be as good as new.\" \"I think I\u0027d better git right on the next train and go back to Jeffersonvillie,\" murmured Shorty, faintly struggling with himself. \"They may need me there.\" \"Nonsense!\" answered Si. \"We\u0027ve done enough for one day. I\u0027ve bin up for two nights now, and am goin\u0027 to have a rest. Let some o\u0027 the other fellers have a show for their money. We haint got to fight this whole war all by ourselves.\" \"No, Si,\" said Shorty, summoning all his resolution; \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 back on the next train. I must git back to the company. They\u0027ll—\" \"You\u0027ll do nothin\u0027 o\u0027 the kind,\" said Si impatiently. \"What\u0027s eatin\u0027 you? What\u0027d you skip out from our house for? What\u0027d you mean—\" He was broken in upon by Maria\u0027s voice as she came in at the head of a bevy of other girls: \"Si Klegg, ain\u0027t you ever comin\u0027 out? What\u0027s akeepin\u0027 you? We\u0027re tired waitin\u0027 for you, and w\u0027re comin\u0027 right in. What\u0027re you doin\u0027 to them ragamuffins that you\u0027ve bin gatherin\u0027 up? Tryin\u0027 to patch \u0027em up into decent-lookin\u0027 men? Think it\u0027ll be like mendin\u0027 a brush-fence—makin\u0027 bad worse. Where on earth did you gather up sich a gang o\u0027 scare-crows? I wouldn\u0027t waste my days and nights pickin\u0027 up sich runts as them. When I go manhuntin\u0027 I\u0027ll gether something that\u0027s worth while.\" Every bright sally of Maria was punctuated with shrieks of laughter from the girls accompanying her. Led by her, they swarmed into the dull, bare room, filling it with the brightness of their youthful presence, their laughter, and their chirruping comments on everything they saw. The jail was a place of deep mystery to them, and it was a daring lark for them to venture in even to the outside rooms. \"The girls dared me to bring \u0027em in,\" Maria explained to Si, \"and I never won\u0027t take no dare from anyone. Si, ain\u0027t you goin\u0027 to kiss your sister? You don\u0027t act a bit glad to see me. Now, if it was Annabel—\" \"Why, Maria,\" said Si, kissing her to stop her mouth, \"I wasn\u0027t expectin\u0027 to see you. What in the world are you doin\u0027 over here?\" \"Why, your Cousin Marthy, here, is goin\u0027 to be married Thursday to her beau, who\u0027s got 10 days\u0027 leave to come home for that purpose. The thing\u0027s bin hurried up, because he got afeared. He heard that Marthy was flyin\u0027 around to singin\u0027 school and sociables with some other fellers that\u0027s home on furlough. So he just brung things to a head, and I rushed over here to help Marthy git ready, and stand by her in the tryin\u0027 hour. Why, here\u0027s Mr. Corporil Elliott, that I hain\u0027t spoken to yit. Well, Mr. Skip-and-away, how d\u0027 you do? Girls, come up here and see a man who thought mother\u0027s cookin\u0027 was not good enough for him. He got homesick for army rations, and run off without so much as sayin\u0027 good-by, to git somethin\u0027 to eat that he\u0027d really enjoy.\" Her merry laugh filled the room, and rang even into the dark cells inside. Shorty shambled to his feet, pulled off his hat, and stood with downcast eyes and burning face. He had never encountered anything so beautiful and so terrifying. Maria was certainly fair to look upon. A buxom, rosy-cheeked lass, something above the average hight of girls, and showing the Klegg blood in her broad chest and heavy, full curves. She was dressed in the hollyhock fashion of country girls of those days, with an exuberance of bright colors, but which Shorty thought the hight of refined fashion. He actually trembled at what the next words would be from those full, red lips, that never seemed to open except in raillery and mocking. \"Well, ain\u0027t you goin\u0027 to shake hands with me? What are you mad about?\" \"Mad? Me mad? What in the world\u0027ve I to be mad about?\" thought Shorty, as he changed his hat to his left hand, and put forth shamedly a huge paw, garnished with red hair and the dust of the march. It seemed so unfit to be touched by her white, plump hand. She gave him a hearty grasp, which reassured him a little, for there was nothing in it, at least, of the derision which seemed to ring in every note of her voice and laughter. \"Girls,\" she called, \"come up and be introduced. This is Mr. Corpril Elliott, Si\u0027s best friend and partner. I call him Mr. Fly-by-night, because he got his dander up about something or nothin\u0027, and skipped out one night without so much\u0027s sayin\u0027—\" \"O, Maria, come off. Cheese it. Dry up,\" said Si impatiently. \"Take us somewhere where we kin git somethin\u0027 to eat. Your tongue\u0027s hung in the middle, and when you start to talkin\u0027 you forgit everything else. I\u0027m hungrier\u0027n a bear, and so\u0027s Shorty.\" An impulse of anger flamed up in Shorty\u0027s heart. How dared Si speak that way to such a peerless creature? How could he talk to her as if she were some ordinary girl? \"O, of course, you\u0027re hungry,\" Maria answered. \"Never knowed you when you wasn\u0027t. You\u0027re worse\u0027n a Shanghai chicken—eat all day and be hungry at night. But I expect you are really hungry this time. Come on. We\u0027ll go right up to Cousin Marthy\u0027s. I sent word that you was in town, and they\u0027re gittin\u0027 ready for you. I seen a dray-load o\u0027 provisions start up that way. Come on, girls. Cousin Marthy, bein\u0027s you\u0027re engaged and Si\u0027s engaged, you kin walk with him. The rest o\u0027 you fall in behind, and I\u0027ll bring up the rear, as Si\u0027d say, with Mr. Fly-by-night, and hold on to him so that he sha\u0027n\u0027t skip again.\" \"Me run away,\" thought Shorty, as they walked along. \"Hosses couldn\u0027t drag me away. I only hope that house is 10 miles off.\" Unfortunately for his cause he could not say nor hint any such a thing, but walked along in dogged silence. The sky was overcast and cheerless, and a chill wind blew, but Shorty never knew such a radiant hour. \"Well, why don\u0027t you say something? What\u0027s become o\u0027 your tongue?\" began Maria banteringly. \"Have you bit it off, or did some girl, that you bolted off in such a hurry to see, drain you so dry o\u0027 talk that you haint got a word left? Who is she? What does she look like? What made you in sich a dreadful hurry to see her? You didn\u0027t go clear up to Bad Ax, did you, and kill that old widower?\" \"Maria,\" called out Si, \"if you don\u0027t stop plaguin\u0027 Shorty I\u0027ll come back there and wring your neck. You kin make the worst nuisance o\u0027 yourself o\u0027 any girl that ever lived. Here, you go up there and walk with Cousin Marthy. I\u0027ll walk with Shorty. I\u0027ve got something I want to say to him.\" With that he crowded in between Maria and Shorty and gave his sister a shove to send her forward. Shorty flared up at the interference. Acute as his suffering was under Maria\u0027s tongue, he would rather endure it than not have her with him. Anyhow, it was a matter between him and her, with which Si had no business. \"You oughtn\u0027t to jaw your sister that way, Si,\" he remonstrated energetically. \"I think it\u0027s shameful. I wouldn\u0027t talk that way to any woman, especially sich a one as your sister.\" \"Whose sister is she, anyway?\" snapped Si, who was as irritable as a hungry and tired man gets. \"You \u0027tend to your sisters and I\u0027ll \u0027tend to mine. I\u0027m helpin\u0027 you. You don\u0027t know Maria. She\u0027s one o\u0027 the best girls in the world, but she\u0027s got a doublegeared, self-actin\u0027 tongue that\u0027s sharper\u0027n a briar. She winds it up Sundays and lets it run all week. I\u0027ve got to comb her down every little while. She\u0027s a filly you can\u0027t manage with a snaffle. Let her git the start and you\u0027d better be dead. The boys in our neighborhood\u0027s afeared to say their soul\u0027s their own when she gits a-goin\u0027. You \u0027tend to the other girls and leave me to \u0027tend to her. She\u0027s my sister—nobody else\u0027s.\" Have Come, Sir, in the Name of The People Of Indiana To Demand the Release of Those Men. 199 Shorty fell back a little and walked sullenly along. The people at the house were expecting them, and had a bountiful supper prepared. A good, sousing wash in the family lavatory in the entry, plentifully supplied with clear water, soap, tin basins and clean roller towels, helped much to restore the boys\u0027 self-respect and good humor. When they were seated at the table Maria, as the particular friend of the family, assisted as hostess, and paid especial attention to supplying Shorty\u0027s extensive wants, and by her assiduous thoughtfulness strengthened her chains upon him and soothed the hurts her tongue had made. Yet he could not see her whisper to one of the other girls, and hear the responsive giggle, but he thought with flushed face that it concerned the Bad Ax incident. But Maria was not doing any such covert work. She was, above everything, bold and outspoken. \"You girls that want a soldier-beau,\" she took opportunity to remark at a little pause in the feast, \"kin jest set your caps for Mr. Corpril Elliott there. He\u0027s in the market. He had a girl up in Bad Ax, Wis., but she went back on him, and married a stay-at-home widower, who\u0027s in the lumber business.\" There was a general giggle, and a chorus of exclamations at such unpatriotic and unwomanly perfidy. Shorty\u0027s appetite fled. \"Maria,\" thundered Si, \"I\u0027ll make you pay for this when I git you alone.\" \"Yes,\" continued the incorrigible tease; \"and they say the best time to ketch a widder is while her eyes is wet. Transplantin\u0027s best in wet weather, and the best time to ketch a feller\u0027s jest when he\u0027s bin jilted.\" Si sprang from the table, as if he would catch Maria and slap her. She laughingly threatened him with a big fork in her hand. They happened to look toward Shorty. He had risen from the table, with the sweat pouring from his burning face. He fumbled in his breast for his silk handkerchief. As he pulled it out there came with it the piece of Maria\u0027s dress, which Shorty had carefully treasured. It fell to the floor. Shorty saw it, and forgetful of all else, stooped over, picked it up, carefully brushed the dust from it, refolded it and put if back in his pocket. Maria\u0027s face changed instantly from laughing raillery, and she made a quick movement to place herself where she would hide from the rest what he was doing. There was a rap at the door and the Sheriff of the County entered. \"Sorry to disturb you at supper,\" he said. \"But there\u0027s some hint of trouble, and I\u0027d like to have you stand by to help me if it comes. The news has gone all over the country of the haul you brung into the\u0027 jail this afternoon, and they say their friends are gatherin\u0027 for a rescue. So many o\u0027 the right kind o\u0027 the boys is away in the army that I hardly know where to look for help. I\u0027m sending word around to all I kin reach. There\u0027s several o\u0027 the boys that\u0027re home gittin\u0027 well o\u0027 wounds that\u0027ll be glad to help. I\u0027m sendin\u0027 buggies for \u0027em. They can\u0027t walk, but they kin stand up and shoot. I\u0027d like to have you come down to the jail as soon\u0027s you git through your supper. And, Serg\u0027t Klegg, will you take command? I ain\u0027t much on the military, but I\u0027ll stay with you and obey orders.\" \"All right. Sheriff; we\u0027ll be right down,\" responded Si with alacrity. \"Git together a few of the boys, and we\u0027ll stand off the Knights. There won\u0027t be much trouble, I think.\" The prospect of a fight transformed Shorty. His shamefacedness vanished instantly, and he straightened up to his full hight with his eyes shining. \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s need o\u0027 disturbin\u0027 the other boys. Sheriff,\" he said. \"I guess me and Si\u0027ll be able to stand off any crowd that they\u0027re likely to run up aginst us.\" \"Don\u0027t know about that,\" said the Sheriff doubtfully. \"They\u0027ve bin gittin\u0027 sassier and sassier lately, and\u0027ve showed more willingness to fight. They\u0027ve put up several very nasty little shindies at one place or another. Out at Charleston, Ill., they killed the Sheriff and a lot o\u0027 soldiers right in the Courthouse yard in broad daylight. I believe they\u0027ve got rebels for officers. We mustn\u0027t take no chances.\" \"Let \u0027em come on,\" said Si. \"We\u0027ve run up aginst rebels before. We\u0027ll be down to the jail in a few minutes. Sheriff.\" The Sheriff\u0027s words had banished the ready laughter from the girls\u0027 lips, and taken away their appetites, but seemed to have sharpened those of Si and Shorty. \"Here, Maria,\" called out Si, as he resumed his place at the table with Shorty, while the girls grouped together and whispered anxiously, \"bring us in some more o\u0027 them slapjacks. We may have to be up all night, and want somethin\u0027 that\u0027ll stay by us.\" \"Yes,\" echoed Shorty, speaking for the first time since he had come into the house; \"I feel as if I\u0027d like to begin all over agin.\" \"I wish you could begin all over agin,\" said Maria in a tone very different from her former one. \"I\u0027d like to cook another supper for you. I wish I could do something to help. Can\u0027t I go with you and do something—load guns, or something? I\u0027ve read about women doin\u0027 somethin\u0027 o\u0027 that kind in the Injun fightin\u0027.\" \"If you could git \u0027em within range o\u0027 your tongue, Maria,\" said Si merrily, \"you\u0027d scatter, \u0027em in short order. No; you stay here, and say your prayers, and go to bed like a good girl, and don\u0027t worry about us. We\u0027ll come out all right. It\u0027s the other fellers\u0027 womenfolks that\u0027ve cause to worry. Let them stay up and walk the floor.\" As the boys walked down to the jail they saw in the darkness squads of men moving around in a portentious way. At the jail were the Sheriff, wearing an anxious look, two or three citizens, and several soldiers, some with their arms in slings, others on crutches. \"I\u0027m so glad you\u0027ve come,\" said the Sheriff. \"Things is beginnin\u0027 to look very ugly outside. They\u0027ve got the whole country stirred up, and men are coming in on every road. You take command, Sergeant Klegg. I\u0027ve bin waitin\u0027 for you, so\u0027s I could drive over to the station and send a dispatch to the Governor. The station\u0027s about a mile from here, but I\u0027ll be back as soon as my horse\u0027ll bring me. I didn\u0027t want to send the dispatch till I was sure there was need of it, for I don\u0027t want to bring soldiers here for nothin\u0027.\" The wheels of the Sheriff\u0027s buggy rattled over the graveled road, and a minute later there was a knock at the outside door. Si opened it and saw there a young man with a smoothly-shaven face, a shock of rumpled hair and wearing a silk hat, a black frockcoat and seedy vest and pantaloons. Si at once recognized him as a lawyer of the place. \"Who\u0027s in charge here?\" he asked. \"I am, for the present,\" said Si. \"There it is,\" said he, in a loud voice, that others might hear; \"a military guard over citizens arrested without warrant of law. I have come, sir, in the name of the people of Indiana, to demand the immediate release of those men.\" \"You kin go, sir, and report to them people that it won\u0027t be did,\" answered Si firmly. \"But they\u0027ve been arrested without due process of law. They\u0027ve been arrested in violation of the Constitution and laws of the State of Indiana, which provide—\" \"I ain\u0027t here to run no debatin\u0027 society,\" Si interrupted, \"but to obey my orders, which is to hold these men safe and secure till otherwise ordered.\" \"I give you fair warning that you will save bloodshed by releasing the men peaceably. We don\u0027t want to shed blood, but—\" \"We\u0027ll take care o\u0027 the bloodshed,\" said Si, nonchalantly. \"We\u0027re in that business. We git $13 a month for it.\" \"Do you defy the sovereign people of Indiana, you military autocrat?\" said the lawyer. \"Look here, mister,\" said Shorty, striding forward. \"Don\u0027t you call my pardner no names, especially none like that. If you want a fight we\u0027re here to accommodate you till you git plum-full of it. But you musn\u0027t call no sich names as that, or I\u0027ll knock your head off.\" \"Whose head\u0027ll you knock off?\" said a burly man, thrusting himself in front of the lawyer, with his fist doubled. \"Yours, for example,\" promptly responded Shorty, sending out his mighty right against the man\u0027s head. \"Don\u0027t be a fool, Markham,\" said the lawyer, catching the man and pushing him back into the crowd behind. \"Now, sir, Sergeant, or Captain, or Colonel, whatever you may call yourself, for I despise military titles, and don\u0027t pretend to know them, I again demand the release of those men. You\u0027ll be foolish to attempt to resist, for we\u0027ve men enough to tear you limb from limb, and jerk down the jail over your heads. Look out for yourself. You can see that the courtyard is full of men. They are determined—desperate, for they have groaned under the iron heel of tyranny.\" \"O, cheese that stump-speech,\" said Si, weariedly. \"\u0027Taint in our enlistment papers to have to listen to \u0027em. You\u0027ve bin warnin\u0027, now I\u0027ll do a little. I\u0027ll shoot the first man that attempts to enter this jail till the Sheriff gits back. If you begin any shootin\u0027 we\u0027ll begin right into your crowd, and we\u0027ll make you sick. There\u0027s some warnin\u0027 that means somethin\u0027.\" \"Your blood be on your own heads, then, you brass-button despots,\" said the lawyer, retiring into the darkness and the crowd. He seemed to give a signal, for a rocket shot up into the air, followed by wild yells from the mob. The large wooden stable in the Courthouse yard burst into flames, and the prisoners inside yelled viciously in response. There was a fusillade of shots, apparently excited and aimless, for none of them struck near. \"Don\u0027t fire, boys,\" said Si, walking around among his guards, \"until there is some reason for it. They\u0027ll probably try to make a rush and batter down the jail door. We\u0027ll watch for that.\" The glare of the burning building showed them preparing for that move. A gang had torn off the heavy rail from the hitching-post on the outside of the square, and were going to use it as a battering-ram. Then came another kind of yell from farther away, and suddenly the mob began running in wild confusion, while into the glare swept a line of soldiers, charging with fixed bayonets. \"A train came in while I was at the depot,\" the Sheriff explained, as he entered the office. \"It had on it a regiment going home on veteran furlough. I asked the Major in command to come over and help us. He and his boys was only too glad for a chance to have some fun and stretch their legs. They came off the cars with a whoop as soon\u0027s they knowed what was wanted. Now, you boys kin go home and git a good night\u0027s sleep. I\u0027ll take these prisoners along with the regiment over to the next County seat, and keep \u0027em there till things cool down here. I\u0027m awfully obliged to you.\" \"Don\u0027t mention it. Glad to do a little thing like that for you any time,\" responded Si, as he and Shorty shook hands with the Sheriff. At the next corner, after leaving the Courthouse square, they met Maria and Martha. \"I just couldn\u0027t stay in the house while this was goin\u0027 on,\" Maria explained. \"I had to come out and see. O, I\u0027m so glad it\u0027s all over and you\u0027re not hurt.\" She caught Shorty\u0027s arm with a fervor that made him thrill all over.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63288.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
