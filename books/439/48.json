{"id":45083,"no":48,"title":"CHAPTER I. OUT ON PICKET","content":"THE BOYS SHOW THE DEACON A NEW WRINKLE IN THE CULINARY ART. \\n\\n \\n\\n SOME days later, Si had charge of a picket-post on the Readyville Pike, near Cripple Deer Creek. The Deacon went with them, at their request, which accorded with his own inclinations, The weather was getting warmer every day, which made him fidgety to get back to his own fields, though Si insisted that they were still under a foot of snow in Indiana. But he had heard so much about picket duty that, next to battle, it was the thing he most wanted to see. Abraham Lincoln was left behind to care for the \"house.\" He had been a disappointment so far, having developed no strong qualities, except for eating and sleeping, of which he could do unlimited quantities. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No use o\u0027 takin\u0027 him out on picket,\" observed Shorty, \"unless we kin git a wagon to go along and haul rations for him. I understand now why these rebels are so poor; the niggers eat up everything they kin raise. I\u0027m afraid, Deacon, he\u0027ll make the Wabash Valley look sick when you turn him loose in it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess my farm kin stand him,\" said the Deacon proudly. \"It stood Si when he was a growin\u0027 boy, though he used, to strain it sometimes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They found a comfortable fence-corner facing16 south for their \"tent,\" which they constructed by making a roof of cedar boughs resting on a rail running from one angle to another. They laid more boughs down in the corner, and on this placed their blankets, making a bed which the Deacon pronounced very inviting and comfortable. They built a fire in front, for warmth and for cooking, and so set up housekeeping in a very neat and soldier-like way. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Klegg Enjoys Solid Comfort. 16 \\n\\n \\n\\n The afternoon passed without special incident. Shorty came in with a couple of chickens, but the17 Deacon had learned enough to repress any questions as to where and how he got them. He soon became more interested in his preparations for cooking them. He had built a big fire in a hole in the ground, and piled a quantity of dry cedar on this. Then he cut off the heads and legs of the chickens, and, getting some mud from the side of the road, proceeded to cover each, feathers and all, with a coating nearly an inch thick. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What in the world do you mean by that, Shorty?\" asked the Deacon in surprise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s all right. Pap,\" assured Si. \"He\u0027ll show you a new wrinkle in chicken-fixin\u0027 that you kin teach mother when you go home. She knows more about cookin\u0027 than any other woman in the world, but I\u0027ll bet she\u0027s not up to this dodge.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The fire had by this time burned down to a heap of glowing embers. The boys scraped a hole in these, laid on it their two balls of mud, then carefully covered them with live coals and piled on a little more wood. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll say right now,\" said the Deacon, \"that I don\u0027t think much o\u0027 that way. Why didn\u0027t you take their feathers off and clean out their innards? Seems to me that\u0027s a nasty way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wait and see,\" said Shorty sententiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si had mixed some meal into a dough in the half-canteens he and Shorty carried in their haversacks. He spread this out on a piece of sheet-iron, and propped it up before the fire. In a little while it was nicely browned over, when Si removed it from the sheet-iron, turned it over, and browned the other side. He repeated this until he had a sufficiency of18 \"hoe cakes\" for their supper. A kettle of good, strong coffee had been boiling on the other side of the fire while this was going on. Then they carefully raked the embers off, and rolled out two balls of hard-baked clay. Waiting for these to cool a little, they broke them. The skin and feathers came off with the pieces and revealed deliciously savory, sweet meat, roasted just to a turn. The intestines had shriveled up with the heat into little, hard balls, which were thrown away. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yum—yum—yum,\" said Shorty, tearing one of the chickens in two, and handing a piece to the Deacon, while Si gave him a sweet, crisp hoe cake and a cup of strong coffee. \"Now, this\u0027s what you might call livin\u0027. Never beat that cookin\u0027 in any house that had a roof. Only do that when you\u0027ve stars in the roof of your kitchen.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It certainly is splendid,\" admitted the Deacon. \"I don\u0027t think Maria could\u0027ve done better.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was yet light when they finished their supper, filled their pipes, and adjusted themselves for a comfortable smoke. One of the men came back and said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Corporal, there\u0027s a rebel on horseback down the road a little ways who seems to be spying on us. We\u0027ve noticed him for some little time. He don\u0027t come up in good range, and we haven\u0027t fired at him, hopin\u0027 he\u0027d come closer. Better come and take a look at him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t do anything to scare him off,\" said Si. \"Keep quiet. Me and Shorty\u0027ll sneak down through the field, out of sight, and git him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They picked up their guns and slipped out under19 the cover of the undergrowth to where they could walk along the fence, screened by the heavy thicket of sumach. Catching the excitement of the occasion, the Deacon followed them at a little distance. \\n\\n \\n\\n Without discovery Si and Shorty made their way to a covert within an easy 50 yards of where the horseman sat rather uneasily on a fine, mettled animal. They got a good look at him. He was a young, slender man, below medium hight, with curly, coalblack hair, short whiskers, a hooked nose, and large, full eyes. He wore a gray suit of rather better make and material than was customary in the rebel army. He had a revolver in his belt and a carbine slung to his saddle, but showed no immediate intention of using either. His right hand rested on his thigh, and his eyes were intently fixed on the distant picket-post. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A rebel scout,\" whispered Si. \"Shall we knock him over, and then order him to surrender, or halt him first, and then shoot?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He can\u0027t git away,\" said Shorty. \"I have him kivered. You kivver his hoss\u0027s head. Then call him down.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si drew his sights fine on the horse\u0027s head and yelled: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Surrender, there, you dumbed rebel.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027surrender, There, You Dumbed Rebel.\u0027 21 \\n\\n \\n\\n The man gave a quick start, a swift glance at the blue uniforms, and instantly both hands went up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is all right, boys. Don\u0027t shoot. I\u0027m a friend,\" he called in a strong German accent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Climb down off o\u0027 that boss, and come here, and do it mighty sudden,\" called out Si, with his finger still on the trigger.20 \\n\\n \\n\\n The horse became restive at the sound of strange voices, but the man succeeded in dismounting, and taking his reins in his hand, led the horse up to the fence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very glad to see you, boys,\" said he, surveying their blue garments with undisguised satisfaction, and putting out his other hand to shake. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Take off that revolver, and hand it here,\" ordered the wary Shorty, following the man with the muzzle of his gun. The man slipped his arm through the reins, unbuckled his revolver, and handed it to Shorty. Si jumped over the fence and seized the carbine. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who are you, and where did you come from?\" asked Si, starting the man up the road toward the post. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What rechiment do you belong to?\" asked the stranger, warily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We belong to Co. Q, 200th Injianny, the best regiment in Gen. Rosecrans\u0027s army,\" answered Si proudly, that the captive might understand where the honor of his taking belonged. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is all right,\" said the stranger, with an air of satisfaction. \"The 200th Indianny is a very good regiment. I saw them whip John Morgan\u0027s cavalry at Green River. Clumsy farmer boys, but shoot like born devils.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But who are you, and where did you come from?\" repeated Si impatiently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m all right. I\u0027m Levi Rosenbaum of Gen. Rosecrans\u0027s secret service. I got some news for him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You have?\" said Si suspiciously. \"Why didn\u0027t you ride right in and tell it to him? What\u0027ve you21 bin hangin\u0027 around here all afternoon, watchin\u0027 our post for?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t sure you was there. I was told that the Yankee pickets was going to be pushed out to Cripple Deer Creek to-day, but I didn\u0027t know it for sure. I was afraid that the rebels was there yet. Jim Jones, of the secret service, had agreed to come out this afternoon and wave a flag if it was all22 right. I was waiting for his sign. But he is probably drunk. He always gets so when he reaches camp.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Deacon joined them in the road, and gave a searching glance at the prisoner. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ain\u0027t you a Jew?\" he inquired presently. \"Ain\u0027t your name Rosenbaum? Didn\u0027t you go through Posey County, Ind., a year or two ago, with a wagon, sellin\u0027 packs o\u0027 cloth to the farmers?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m an American citizen,\" said the man proudly, \"the same as the rest of you. My religion is Hebrew. I don\u0027t know and don\u0027t care what your religion is. Every man has the religion that suits him. My name is Rosenbaum. I did sell cloth in Posey County, unt all over Indianny. It was good cloth, too, unt I sold it at a bargain.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It certainly was good cloth, and cheap,\" admitted the Deacon. \"What in the world are you doin\u0027 down here in them clothes?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m doing just what these men are doing here in their cloze,\" answered Rosenbaum. \"I\u0027m trying to serve the country. I\u0027m doing it different from them, because I\u0027m built different from them. I hope I\u0027m doing it well. But I\u0027m awfully hungry. Got anything to eat? Just a cup of coffee and a cracker? Don\u0027t care for any pork.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, we\u0027ll give you something to eat,\" said Shorty. \"I think there\u0027s some of our chicken left. You\u0027ll find that good.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did you cook that?\" said Rosenbaum, looking at the tempting morsel suspiciously. \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty explained.23 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thanks; I can\u0027t eat it,\" said Rosenbaum with a sigh. \"It ain\u0027t kosher.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What the devil\u0027s that?\" asked Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s my religion. I can\u0027t explain. Send for the Officer of the Guard to take me to Headquarters,\" answered Rosenbaum, sipping his coffee. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63235.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
