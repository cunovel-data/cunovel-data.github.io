{"id":45147,"no":112,"title":"CHAPTER III. THE PARTNERS GET BACK TO THEIR REGIMENT AT LAST","content":"WITH ALL THEIR RECRUITS. SI AND SHORTY were too glad to get their boys back, and too eager to find their regiment, to waste any time in scolding the derelicts. \"Now that you boys have had a good breakfast,\" Si remarked with an accent of cutting sarcasm, \"at the expense of that kind-hearted gentleman, Mr. Billings, I\u0027m goin\u0027 to give you a pleasant little exercise in the shape of a forced march. If you don\u0027t make the distance between here and the other side o\u0027 Rossville Gap quicker\u0027n ary squad has ever made it I\u0027m much mistaken. Shorty, put yourself on the left and bring up the rear.\" \"You bet,\" answered Shorty, \"and I\u0027ll take durned good care I don\u0027t lose little Pete Skidmore.\" \"Now,\" commanded Si, getting a good lay of the ground toward the gap, \"Attention. All ready? Forward, march.\" He led off with the long march stride of the veteran, and began threading his way through the maze of teams, batteries, herds, and marching men and stragglers with the ease and certainty born of long acquaintance with crowded camps. He dodged around a regiment here, avoided a train there, and slipped through a marching battery at the next place with a swift, unresting progress that quickly took away the boys\u0027 wind and made them pant with the exertion of keeping up. In the rear was the relentless Shorty. \"Close up, there! Close up!\" he kept shouting to those in front. \"Don\u0027t allow no gaps between you. Keep marchin\u0027 distance—19 inches from back to breast. Come along, Pete. I ain\u0027t a-goin\u0027 to lose you, no matter what happens.\" \"Sarjint,\" gasped flarry Joslyn, after they had gone a couple of miles, \"don\u0027t you call this purty fast marchin\u0027?\" \"Naah,\" said Si contemptuously. \"We\u0027re just crawlin\u0027 along. Wait till we git where it\u0027s a little clear, and then we\u0027ll go. Here, cut acrost ahead o\u0027 that battery that\u0027s comin\u0027 up a-trot.\" There was a rush for another mile or two, when there was a momentary halt to allow a regiment of cavalry to go by at a quick walk. \"Goodness,\" murmured Gid Mackall, as he set down the carpet-sack which he would persist in carrying, \"are they always in a hurry? I s\u0027posed that when soldiers wuzzent marchin\u0027 or fightin\u0027 they lay around camp and played cards and stole chickens, and wrote letters home, but everybody \u0027round here seems on the dead rush.\" \"Don\u0027t seem to be nobody pic-nickin\u0027 as far\u0027s I kin see,\" responded Si, \"but we hain\u0027t no time to talk about it now. We must git to the rijimint. Forward!\" Another swift push of two or three miles brought them toward the foot of Mission Ridge, and near the little, unpainted frame house which had once been the home of John Ross, the chief of the Cherokees. \"Boys, there\u0027s the shebang or palace of the big Injun who used to be king of all these mountains and valleys,\" said Si, stopping the squad to give them a much needed rest. \"He run this whole country, and had Injuns to burn, though he generally preferred to burn them that didn\u0027t belong to his church.\" \"Roasted his neighbors instid o\u0027 his friends in a heathen sort of a way,\" continued Shorty. \"What was his name?\" inquired Monty Scruggs. \"John Ross.\" \"Humph, not much of a name,\" said Monty in a disappointed tone, for he had been an assiduous reader of dime novels. \"\u0027Tain\u0027t anything like as fine as Tecumseh, and Osceola, and Powhatan, and Jibbeninosay, and Man-Afraid-of-Gettin\u0027-His-Neck-Broke. Wasn\u0027t much of a big Injun.\" \"Deed he was,\" answered Si. \"He and his fathers before him run\u0027 this whole neck o\u0027 woods accordin\u0027 to the big Injun taste, and give the Army o\u0027 the United States all they wanted to do. Used to knock all the other Injuns around here about like ten-pins. The Rosses were bosses from the word go.\" \"Don\u0027t sound right, though,\" said Monty regretfully. \"And such a shack as that don\u0027t look like the wigwam of a great chief. \u0027Tain\u0027t any different from the hired men\u0027s houses on the farms in Injianny.\" \"Well, all the same, it\u0027s got to go for the scene of a cord o\u0027 dime novels,\" said Shorty. \"We\u0027ve brung in civilization and modern improvements and killed more men around here in a hour o\u0027 working time than the ignorant, screechin\u0027 Injuns killed since the flood.\" \"Do them rijimints look like the 200th Injianny?\" anxiously inquired Harry Joslyn, pointing to some camps on the mountain-side, where the men were drilling and engaged in other soldierly duties. \"Them,\" snorted Shorty contemptuously. \"Them\u0027s only recruits that ain\u0027t got licked into shape yet. When you see the 200th Injianny you\u0027ll see a rijimint, I tell you. Best one in the army. You ought to be mighty proud you got a chanst to git into sich a rijimint.\" \"We are; we are,\" the boys assured him. \"But we\u0027re awful anxious to see jest what it\u0027s like.\" \"Well, you\u0027ll see in a little while the boss lot o\u0027 boys. Every one of \u0027em fightin\u0027 cocks, thoroughbred—not a dunghill feather or strain in the lot. Weeded \u0027em all out long ago. All straight-cut gentlemen. They\u0027ll welcome you like brothers and skin you out of every cent o\u0027 your bounty, if you play cards with \u0027em. They\u0027re a dandy crowd when it comes to fingerin\u0027 the pasteboards. They\u0027ll be regler fathers to you, but you don\u0027t want to play no cards with \u0027em.\" \"I thought you said they wuz all gentlemen and would be regler brothers to us,\" said Harry Joslyn. \"So they will—so they will. But your brother\u0027s the feller that you\u0027ve got to watch clostest when he\u0027s settin\u0027 in front o\u0027 you with one little pair. He\u0027s the feller that\u0027s most likely to know all you know about the cards and what he knows besides. They\u0027ve bin skinnin\u0027 one another so long that they\u0027ll be as anxious to git at your fresh young blood as a New Orleans skeeter is to sink into a man just from the North.\" \"Didn\u0027t think they\u0027d allow gambling in so good a regiment as the 200th Ind.,\" remarked Alf Russell, who was a devoted attendant on Sunday school. \"Don\u0027t allow it. It\u0027s strictly prohibited.\" \"But I thought that in the army you carried out orders, if you had to kill men.\" \"Well, there\u0027s orders and orders,\" said Shorty, philosophically. \"Most of \u0027em you obey to the last curl on the letter R, and do it with a jump. Some of \u0027em you obey only when you have to, and take your chances at improving the State o\u0027 Tennessee by buildin\u0027 roads and diggin\u0027 up stumps in the parade ground if you\u0027re ketched not mindin\u0027. Of them kind is the orders agin gamblin\u0027.\" \"Shorty, stop talkin\u0027 to the boys about gamblin\u0027. I won\u0027t have it,\" commanded Si. \"Boys, you mustn\u0027t play cards on no account, especially with older men. It\u0027s strictly agin orders, besides which I\u0027ll break any o\u0027 your necks that I ketch at it. You must take care o\u0027 your money and send it home. Forward, march.\" They went up the road from the John Ross house until they came to that turning off to the right by a sweet gum and a sycamore, as indicated by Gen. Sherman, and then began a labored climbing of the rough, stony way across Mission Ridge. Si\u0027s and Shorty\u0027s eagerness to get to the regiment increased so with their nearness to it that they went at a terrific pace in spite of all obstacles. \"Please, Sarjint,\" begged Gid Mackall, as they halted for an instant near a large rock, \"need we go quite so fast? We\u0027re awfully anxious to git to the regiment, too, but I feel like as if I\u0027d stove two inches offen my legs already against them blamed rocks.\" \"I can\u0027t keep up. I can\u0027t keep up at all,\" whimpered little Pete Skidmore. \"You are just dead certain to lose me.\" \"Pull out just a little more, boys,\" Si said pleasantly. \"We must be almost there. It can\u0027t be but a little ways now.\" \"Close up there in front!\" commanded Shorty. \"Keep marchin\u0027 distance—19 inches from back to breast. Come on, Pete. Gi\u0027 me your hand; I\u0027ll help you along.\" \"I ain\u0027t no kid, to be led along by the hand,\" answered Pete sturdily, refusing the offer. \"I\u0027ll keep up somehow. But you can\u0027t expect my short legs to cover as much ground as them telegraph poles o\u0027 your\u0027n.\" The summit of the ridge was crossed and a number of camps appeared along the slope. \"Wonder which one o\u0027 them is the 200th Injianny\u0027s?\" said Si to Shorty. \"I thought the 200th Injianny was so much finer rijimint than any other that you\u0027d know it at sight,\" said Harry Joslyn, with a shade of disappointment in his voice. \"I would know it if I was sure I was lookin\u0027 at it,\" answered Shorty. \"But they seem to have picked out all the best rijimints in the army to go into camp here this side o\u0027 Mission Ridge. Mebbe they want to make the best show to the enemy.\" \"That looks like the camp o\u0027 the 200th Injianny over there,\" said Si, pointing to the right, after scanning the mountain-side. \"See all them red shirts hangin\u0027 out to dry? That\u0027s Co. A; they run to red flannel shirts like a nigger barber to striped pants.\" \"No,\" answered Shorty; \"that\u0027s that Ohio rijimint, made up o\u0027 rollin\u0027 mill men and molders. They all wear red flannel shirts. There\u0027s the 200th Injianny just down there to the left, with all them men on extra duty on the parade ground. I know just the gang. Same old crowd; I kin almost tell their faces. They\u0027ve bin runnin\u0027 guard, as usual, and comin\u0027 back full o\u0027 apple-jack and bad language and desire to give the camp a heavy coat o\u0027 red paint. Old McBiddle has tried to convince \u0027em that he was still runnin\u0027 the rijimint, and his idees wuz better \u0027n theirs, and there they are. There\u0027s Jim Monaghan handlin\u0027 that pick as if he was in the last stages o\u0027 consumption. There\u0027s Barney\u0027 Maguire, pickin\u0027 up three twigs \u0027bout as big as lead pencils, and solemnly carryin\u0027 \u0027em off the parade ground as if they wuz fence-rails. I\u0027ll just bet a month\u0027s pay that\u0027s Denny Murphy marchin\u0027 up and down there with his knapsack filled with Tennessee dornicks. Denny\u0027s done that feather-weight knapsack trick so often that his shoulders have corns and windgalls on \u0027em, and they always keep a knapsack packed for him at the guard-house ready for one of his Donnybrook fair songs and dances. Mighty good boy, Denny, but he kin git up a red-hotter riot on his share of a canteen of apple-jack than any three men in the rijimint. That feller tied to a tree is Tony Wilson. He\u0027s refused to dig trenches agin. O, I tell you, they\u0027re a daisy lot.\" \"Shorty,\" admonished Si. \"You mustn\u0027t talk that way before the boys. What\u0027ll they think o\u0027 the rijimint?\" \"Think of it?\" said Shorty, recovering himself. \"They\u0027ve got to think of it as the very best rijimint that ever stood in line-of-battle. I\u0027ll punch the head of any man that says anything to the contrary. Every man in it is a high-toned, Christian gentleman. Mind that, now, every one of you brats, and don\u0027t you allow nobody to say otherwise.\" \"No,\" said Si, after further study of the camps, \"neither o\u0027 them \u0027s the 200th Injianny. They\u0027ve both got brass bands. Must be new rijimints.\" \"Say,\" said Shorty, \"there\u0027s a royal lookin\u0027 rooster standin\u0027 up in front of that little house there. Looks as if the house was headquarters for some highroller, and him doin\u0027 Orderly duty. If he knows as much as he\u0027s got style, he knows more\u0027n old Sherman himself. Go up and ask him.\" It was the first time in all their service that either of them had seen a soldier in the full dress prescribed by the United States Army regulations, and this man had clearly won the coveted detail of Orderly by competition with his comrades as being the neatest, best-dressed man in the squad. He was a tall, fine-looking young man, wearing white gloves and a paper collar, with a spotless dress coat buttoned to the chin, his shoes shining like mirrors, his buttons and belt-plates like new gold, and his regulation hat caught up on the left side with a feather and a gilt eagle. The front of his hat was a mass of gilt letters and figures and a bugle, indicating his company, regiment and State. On his breast was a large, red star. \"Jehosephat,\" sighed Shorty. \"I wish I had as many dollars as he has style. Must be one of old Abe\u0027s body guards, sent out here with Grant\u0027s commission as Lieutenant-General. Expect that red star passes him on the railroads and at the hotels. I\u0027d like to play him two games out o\u0027 three, cut-throat, for it. I could use it in my business.\" \"No,\" said the Orderly to Si, with a strong Yankee twang, \"I don\u0027t know a mite about the 200th Ind. Leastwise, I don\u0027t remember it. Everybody down here\u0027s from Indiana, Ohio or Illinois. It\u0027s one eternal mix, like Uncle Jed Stover\u0027s fish—couldn\u0027t tell shad, herring nor sprat from one another. It seems to me more like a \u0027tarnal big town-meeting than an army. All talk alike, and have got just as much to say; all act alike. Can\u0027t tell where an Indiana regiment leaves off and Ohio one begins; can\u0027t tell officer from private, everybody dresses as he pleases, and half of them don\u0027t wear anything to tell where they belong. There wasn\u0027t a corps badge in the whole army when we come here.\" \"Corps badges—what\u0027s them?\" asked Si. \"Corps badges? Why this is one,\" said the man, tapping his red star. \"This shows I belong to the Twelfth Corps—best corps in the Army of the Potomac, and the First Division—best division in the corps. We have to wear them so\u0027s to show our General which are his men, and where they be. Haven\u0027t you no corps badges?\" \"Our General don\u0027t have to tag us,\" said Shorty, who had come up and listened. \"He knows all of us that\u0027s worth knowin\u0027, and that we\u0027ll go wherever he orders us, and stay there till he pulls us off. Our corps badge\u0027s a full haversack and Springfield rifle sighted up to 1,200 yards.\" \"Well, you do fight in a most amazing way,\" said the Orderly, cordially. \"We never believed it of such rag-tag and bobtail until we saw you go up over Mission Ridge. You were all straggling then, but you were straggling toward the enemy. Never saw such a mob, but it made the rebels sick.\" \"Well, if you\u0027d seen us bustin\u0027 your old friend Long-street at Snodgrass Hill, you\u0027d seen some hefightin\u0027. We learned him that he wasn\u0027t monkeyin\u0027 with the Army o\u0027 the Potomac, but with fellers that wuz down there for business, and not to wear paper collars and shine their buttons. He come at us seven times before we could git that little fact through his head, and we piled up his dead like cordwood.\" \"Well, you didn\u0027t do any better than we did with Early\u0027s men at Gulp\u0027s Hill, if we do wear paper collars,\" returned the other proudly. \"After we got through with Johnston\u0027s Division you couldn\u0027t see the ground in front for the dead and wounded. And none of your men got up on Lookout Mountain any quicker\u0027n we did. Paper collars and red stars showed you the way right along.\" \"My pardner\u0027s only envious because he hain\u0027t no paper collars nor fine clothes,\" said Si, conciliatorily. \"I\u0027ve often told him that if he\u0027d leave chuck-a-luck alone and save his money he\u0027d be able to dress better\u0027n Gen. Grant.\" \"Gen. Grant\u0027s no great shakes as a dresser,\" returned the other. \"I was never so surprised in my life as one day when I was Orderly at Division Headquarters, and a short man with a red beard, and his clothes spattered with mud, rode up, followed by one Orderly, and said, \u0027Orderly, tell the General that Gen. Grant would like to see him.\u0027 By looking hard I managed to make out three stars on his shoulder. Why, if Gen. McClellan had been coming you\u0027d have seen him for a mile before he got there.\" \"If Gen. Grant put on as much style in proportion to what he done as McClellan, you could see him as far as the moon,\" ventured Shorty. \"Well, we\u0027re not gettin\u0027 to the rijimint,\" said the impatient Si. \"Le\u0027s rack on. So long, Orderly. Come and see us in the 200th Injianny and we\u0027ll treat you white. Forward, march!\" \"There\u0027s a couple of boys comin\u0027 up the road. Probably they kin tell us where the rijimint is,\" suggested Shorty. The two boys were evidently recruits of some months\u0027 standing, but not yet considered seasoned soldiers. \"No,\" they said, \"there is no 200th Ind. here now. It was here yesterday, and was camped right over there, where you see that old camp, but before noon came an order to march with three days\u0027 rations and 40 rounds. It went out the Lafayette Road, and the boys seemed to think they wuz goin\u0027 out to Pigeon Mountain to begin the general advance o\u0027 the army, and wuz mightily tickled over it.\" \"Gone away,\" said Si, scanning the abandoned camp sadly; \"everybody couldn\u0027t have gone. They must\u0027ve left somebody behind that wasn\u0027t able to travel, and somebody to take care o\u0027 \u0027em. They must\u0027ve left some rijimintal stuff behind and a guard over it.\" \"No,\" the boys assured him. \"They broke up camp completely. All that wasn\u0027t able to march was sent to the hospital in Chattynoogy. Every mite of stuff was loaded into wagons and hauled off with \u0027em. They never expected to come back.\" \"That camp ground don\u0027t look as it\u0027d bin occupied for two weeks,\" said Shorty. \"See the ruts made by the rain in the parade ground and the general look o\u0027 things. I don\u0027t believe the rijimint only left there yisterday. It don\u0027t look as if the 200th Injianny ever had sich a camp. It\u0027s more like one o\u0027 the camps o\u0027 them slack-twisted Kaintucky and Tennessee rijimints.\" \"If Oi didn\u0027t belave that Si Klegg and Sharty was did intoirely, and up home in Injianny, Oi\u0027d be sure that was their v\u0027ices,\" said a voice from the thicket by the side of the road. The next instant a redheaded man, with a very distinct map of Ireland in his face, leaped out, shouting: 041 (105K) \"Si and Sharty, ye thieves of the worruld, whin did ye get back, and how are yez? Howly saints, but Oi\u0027m glad to see yez.\" \"Jim Monaghan, you old Erin-go-bragh,\" said Shorty, putting his arm around the man\u0027s neck, \"may I never see the back o\u0027 my neck, but I\u0027m glad to see you. I was just talkin\u0027 about you. I thought I recognized you over there in one of the camps, at your favorite occupation of extry dooty, cleanin\u0027 up the parade ground.\" \"No; Oi\u0027ve not bin on extry doty for narely two wakes now, but it\u0027s about due. But here comes Barney Maguire and Con Taylor, Tony Wilson and the rest iv the gang. Lord love yez, but they\u0027ll be surely glad to see yez.\" The others came up with a tumultuous welcome to both. \"Where\u0027s the camp?\" asked Si. \"Jist bey ant—jist bey ant them cedars there—not a musket-shot away,\" answered Jim, pointing to the place. \"What\u0027d you mean, you infernal liars, by tellin\u0027 us that the rijimint was gone?\" said Shorty, wrathfully to the men whom he had met, and who were still standing near, looking puzzled at the demonstrations. \"Aisy, now, aisy,\" said Jim. \"We\u0027re to blame for that, so we are. Ye say, we wint over by Rossville last night and had a bit av a shindy and cleaned out a sutler\u0027s shop. We brought away some av the most illegant whisky that iver wet a man\u0027s lips, and hid it down there in the gulch, where we had jist come back for it. We sane you comin\u0027 and thought yez was the provo-guard after us. Ye say ye stopped there and talked to that peacock at the Provo-Marshal\u0027s quarters, and we thought yez was gittin\u0027 instructions. We sint these rookies out, who we thought nobody\u0027d know, to give you a little fairy story about the rijimint being gone, to throw you off the scint, until we could finish the liquor.\" \"Yes, I know,\" laughed Shorty, \"after you\u0027d got the budge down you didn\u0027t care what happened. You\u0027re the same old brick-topped Connaught Ranger.\" \"You and Si come down into the gulch and jine us.\" \"Can\u0027t think of it for a minute,\" said Shorty with great self-denial. \"Don\u0027t speak so loud before these boys. They\u0027re recruits for the rijimint. We must take \u0027em into camp. We\u0027ll see you later.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63299.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
