{"id":45081,"no":46,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. TRYING TO EDUCATE ABRAHAM LINCOLN","content":"TOO HIGH-PRESSURE SCHOOLING—THE BOYS ON PICKET. \\n\\n \\n\\n ALL THREE of the men at once became guardians of Abraham Lincoln, and in their several ways heartily interested in his welfare. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Deacon was fired by the missionary spirit of his kind and class. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No use talkin\u0027 no more about the heathen \u0027On Greenland\u0027s icy mountains,\u0027 or any place else,\" he communed with himself that evening, as he sat and smoked, and occasionally glanced at the ebon face of the sleeper in the corner. \"Providence has cut out a job for me, and sent it home. Rather, He sent me where I couldn\u0027t help stumblin\u0027 upon it, and reckonizin\u0027 it. The responsibility to Him is clear. I\u0027ve got heathen enough to last me for a \u0027coon\u0027s age, to lift that poor, ignorant soul up, and bring it to a knowledge of Christian ways. He\u0027s not nice nor purty; never heard of a pagan that wuz. Wouldn\u0027t be pagans if they wuz. But he\u0027s a man and a brother, and the Bible says that I\u0027m my brother\u0027s keeper. I\u0027ll keep him agin fifty-\u0027leven o\u0027 that old snortin\u0027 rebel and Copperhead Blowhard Billings. I wuzzent brung up in the woods to be scared by the hootin\u0027 of an owl.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We might take him along with us, Si,\" said Shorty, in a low tone, with a nod toward Abraham267 Lincoln. \"We could make a bully cook out of him. We could have no end of fun with him. We could learn him lots o\u0027 tricks. He\u0027s as strong as an ox, and after I\u0027d give him a few lessons in puttin\u0027 up his hands, he\u0027d knock out that sassy nigger o\u0027 the Colonel\u0027s.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think so, too,\" acquiesced Si, with an estimating glance at the sleeper. \\n\\n \\n\\n Abraham Lincoln\u0027s education began bright and early the next morning, when Shorty kicked and shook him into wakefulness at the sound of the reveille. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Git up; git up,\" said Shorty. \"Wash your hands and face, comb your hair, cut some wood and put it on the fire, and bring a kettle o\u0027 water from the spring.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wash my hands and face,\" said the negro, in a dazed way. \"Wha\u0027 fo\u0027? Don\u0027t got nufin on dem. Comb my ha\u0027r? Nebber did dat in my life.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, you\u0027ve got to do it now every mornin\u0027, and be spry about it, too. Come, don\u0027t move around as if sawed out o\u0027 basswood. This ain\u0027t nigger-quarters. Git some springs in your feet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And he emphasized his injunctions with a vigorous push. \\n\\n \\n\\n The negro\u0027s face looked as if he began to have doubts as to whether freedom was all that had been represented to him. To have to get up early every morning, and wash his face and hands and comb his hair, seemed at the moment to be a high price to pay for liberty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does I hab tuh do dat ebbery mornin\u0027, Boss?\" he said, turning with a look of plaintive inquiry to the Deacon.268 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, certainly,\" said the Deacon, who had just finished his own ablutions,\u0027 and was combing his hair. \"Every man must do that to be decent.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abraham Lincoln gave a deep sigh. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Washes himself as if he\u0027s afraid the water\u0027d scald him,\" said the Deacon, watching the negro\u0027s awkward efforts. \"He\u0027ll have to take more kindly to water, if he comes into a Baptist total immersion family. There\u0027s no salvation except by water, and plenty of it, too. Now,\" he continued, as the black man had finished, \"pick up that ax and cut some wood to get breakfast with.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Abraham Lincoln took the ax, and began belaboring the wood, while the Deacon studied him with a critical eye. There was little that the Deacon prided himself on more than his skill as a wood chopper. People who think the ax is a simple, skill-less tool, dependent for its efficiency solely upon the strength and industry with which it is wielded, make a great mistake. There is as much difference in the way men handle axes, and in the result they produce, as there is in their playing the violin. Anybody can chop, it is true, as anybody can daub with a paint brush, but a real axman of the breed of the Deacon, who had gone into the wilderness with scarcely any other tool than an ax, can produce results with it of which the clumsy hacker can scarcely imagine. The Deacon watched the negro\u0027s work with disgust and impatience. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hadn\u0027t oughter named sich a clumsy pounder as that \u0027Abraham Lincoln,\u0027\" he mused. \"Old Abe could handle an ax with the best of \u0027em. This feller handles it as if it was a handspike. If Si couldn\u0027t \u0027ve269 used an ax better\u0027n that when he was 10 years old, I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 felt mortally ashamed o\u0027 him. Gracious, what a job I have before me o\u0027 makin\u0027 a first-class man out o\u0027 him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Deacon Gives Abe a Lesson in Wood Chopping 269 \\n\\n \\n\\n He took the ax from the negro\u0027s hand, and patiently showed him how to hold and strike with it. The man apparently tried his best to learn, but it270 was a perspiring effort for him and the Deacon. The negro presently dropped his ax, sat down on the log, and wiped his forehead with his shirtsleeve. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Fore God, Boss, dat\u0027s de hardest way ob cuttin\u0027 wood dat I ebber seed. Hit\u0027ll kill me done daid to chop wood dat a-way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pshaw!\" said the impatient Deacon. \"You\u0027re simply stupid; that\u0027s all. That\u0027s the only way to handle an ax. You kin cut with half the work that way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He was discovering what so many of us have found out, that among the hardest things in life is that of getting people to give up clumsy ways for those that are better. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the meantime the boys had gotten breakfast. Then Shorty, who was dying to train their new acquisition for a winning fight with the Colonel\u0027s negro, took him behind the house for a little private instruction in boxing. The field-hand had never even heard of such a thing before, but Shorty was too much in earnest to care for a little thing like that. He went at his task with a will, making the negro double his fists just so, strike in a particular way, make a certain \"guard,\" and hit out scientifically. Shorty was so enthusiastic that he did not stop to think that it was severe labor for the poor negro, and when he had to stop his lesson at the end of half an hour to go on battalion drill he left his pupil in a state of collapse. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ignorant of the new ordeal through which his charge had been going, the Deacon went out in search of him. He had just finished reading the news in the Cincinnati Commercial, ending with an271 editorial on \"Our Duty Toward the Freedmen,\" which impelled him to think that he could not begin Abraham Lincoln\u0027s education too soon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, Abe,\" said he briskly, \"you\u0027ve had a good rest, and it\u0027s time that you should be doin\u0027 some thing. You ought to learn to read as soon as possible, and you might as well begin to learn your letters at once. I\u0027ll give you your first lesson. Here are some nice large letters in this newspaper head, that you kin learn very easily. Now, the first one is T. You see it is a cross.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Afo\u0027 de Lawd, Boss,\" wailed the desperate negro, \"I jest can\u0027t l\u0027arn no mo\u0027, now, nohow. \u0027Deed I can\u0027t. Hit\u0027s bin nuffin but l\u0027arn, l\u0027arn, ebbery minnit sense I got up dis mawnin\u0027, an\u0027 my haid\u0027s jest bustin\u0027, so hit is. I a\u0027most wisht I wuz back wid my ole mas\u0027r, who didn\u0027t want to l\u0027arn me nuffin.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The astonished Deacon paused and reflected. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mebbe we\u0027ve bin tryin\u0027 to force this plant too fast. There\u0027s danger about puttin\u0027 new wine into old bottles. It\u0027s not the right way to train anything. The way to break a colt is to hang the bridle on the fence where he kin see and smell it for a day or two. I\u0027ll go a little slow with him at first. Would you like something more to eat, Abe?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Boss. \u0027Deed I would,\" answered the negro with cheerful promptness, forgetting all about the pangs of the \"new birth of freedom.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n THE END OF BOOK NO. 2. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63233.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
