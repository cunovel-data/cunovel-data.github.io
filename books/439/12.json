THE PLAGUE OF THE SOLDIER","content":"INTRODUCTION TO \"ONE WHO STICKETH CLOSER THAN A BROTHER.\" \n \n \"HELLO Si; goin\u0027 for a soljer, ain\u0027t ye?\" \n \n \"You bet!\" \n \n \"Wall, you\u0027d better b\u0027lieve its great fun; it\u0027s jest a picnic all the time! But, say, Si, let\u0027s see yer finger-nails!\" \n \n \"I\u0027d like ter know what finger-nails \u0027s got to do with soljerin\u0027!\" said Si. \"The \u0027cruitin\u0027 ossifer \u0027n\u0027 the man \u0027t keeps the doctor shop made me shuck myself, \u0027n\u0027 then they \u0027xamined my teeth, \u0027n\u0027 thumped me in the ribs, \u0027n\u0027 rubbed down my legs, \u0027n\u0027 looked at my hoofs, same \u0027s if \u0027I\u0027d bin a hoss they wuz buyin\u0027, but they didn\u0027t say nothin\u0027 \u0027bout my finger-nails.\" \n \n \"You jest do \u0027s I tell ye; let \u0027em grow, \u0027n\u0027 keep \u0027em right sharp. Ye\u0027ll find plenty o\u0027 use fer \u0027em arter a while, \u0027n\u0027 \u0027twont be long, nuther. I know what I\u0027m talkin\u0027 \u0027bout; I\u0027ve been thar!\" \n \n This conversation took place a day or two before Si bade farewell to his mother and sister Marier and pretty Annabel and left the peaceful precincts of Posey County to march away with the 200th Ind. for that awful place vaguely designated as \"the front!\" He had promptly responded to the call, and his name was near the top of the list of Company Q. \n \n \u0027let Yer Nails Grow; Ye\u0027ll Need \u0027em\u0027 097 \n \n Si already had his blue clothes on. By enlisting early he had a good pick of the various garments, and so got a suit that fitted his form—which was plump as an apple-dumpling tolerably well. It was left for the tail-enders of the company to draw trousers that were six inches too long or too short, and blouses that either wouldn\u0027t reach around, and left yawning chasms in front, or were so large that they looked as if they were hung on bean-poles. \n \n Of course, Si couldn\u0027t be expected to do any more plodding farm work, now that he had \"jined\" the army. While the company was filling up he spent most of his time on dress parade in the village near by, eliciting admiring smiles from all the girls, and an object of the profoundest awe and wonder to tha small boys. \n \n One day Si was sitting on the sugar-barrel in the corner grocery, gnawing a \"blind robin,\" and telling how he thought the war wouldn\u0027t last long after the 200th Ind. got down there and took a hand and got fairly interested in the game; they would wind it up in short meter. Such ardent emotions always seethed and bubbled in the swelling breasts of the new troops when they came down to show the veterans just how to do it. \n \n One of the town boys who had been a year in the service, had got a bullet through his arm in a skirmish, and was at home on furlough, came into the store, and then took place the dialog between him and Si that opens this chapter. \n \n Si wondered a good deal what the veteran meant about the finger-nails. He did not even know that there existed in any nature a certain active and industrious insect which, before he had been in the army a great while, would cause his heart to overflow with gratitude to a beneficent Providence for providing him with nails on his fingers. \n \n When the 200th left Indiana all the boys had, of course, brand-new outfits right from Uncle Sam\u0027s great one-price clothing house. Their garments were nice and clean, their faces well washed, and their hair yet showed marks of the comb. At Louisville they stuck up their noses, with a lofty consciousness of superiority, at the sight of Buell\u0027s tanned and ragged tramps, who had just come up on the gallop from Tennessee and northern Alabama. \n \n \u0027say, Cap, What Kind O\u0027 Bug is This?\u0027 099 \n \n If the new Hoosier regiment had been quartered for a while in long-used barracks, or had pitched its tents in an old camp, Si would very soon have learned, in the school of experience, the delightful uses of finger-nails. But the 200th stayed only a single night in Louisville and then joined the procession that started on the chase after the rebel army. It generally camped on new ground, and under these circumstances the insect to which allusion has been made did not begin its work of devastation with that suddenness that usually marked its attack upon soldiers entering the field. But he never failed to \"git there\" sooner or later, and it was more frequently sooner than later. \n \n One afternoon, when a few days out on this march, a regiment of Wisconsin veterans bivouacked next to the 200th Ind. The strange antics as they threw off their accouterments attracted Si\u0027s attention. \n \n \"Look a\u0027 thar,\" he said to Shorty. \"What \u0027n name of all the prophets \u0027s them fellers up to?\" \n \n \"Seems like they was scratchin\u0027 theirselves!\" \n \n \"I s\u0027pose that\u0027s on account of the dust \u0027n\u0027 sweat,\" said Si. \n \n \"It\u0027s a mighty sight worse \u0027n that!\" replied Shorty, who knew more about these things than Si did. \"I reckon we\u0027ll all be doin\u0027 like they are \u0027fore long.\" \n \n Si whistled softly to himself as he watched the Wisconsin boys. They were hitching and twisting their shoulders about, evidently enjoying the friction of the clothing upon their skins. There was a general employment of fingers, and often one would be seen getting come other fellow to scratch his back around where he couldn\u0027t reach himself. If everybody was too busy to do this for him he would back up to a tree and rub up and down against the bark. \n \n Life has few pleasures that can equal the sensations of delightful enjoyment produced in those days, when graybacks were plenty, by rubbing against a tree that nicely fitted the hollow of the back, after throwing off one\u0027s \"traps\" at the end of a day\u0027s march. \n \n Directly the Wisconsin chaps began to scatter into the woods. Si watched them as they got behind the trees and threw off their blouses and shirts. He thought at first that perhaps they were going in swimming, but there was no stream of water at hand large enough to justify this theory in explanation of their nudity. As each man set down, spread his nether garment over his knees and appeared to be intently engaged, with eyes and fingers. Si\u0027s curiosity was very much excited. \n \n \"Looks \u0027s if they wuz all mendin\u0027 up their shirts and sewin\u0027 on buttons,\" said Si, \"Guess it\u0027s part o\u0027 their regular drill, ain\u0027t it, Shorty?\" \n \n Shorty laughed at Si\u0027s ignorant simplicity. He knew what those veterans were doing, and he knew that Si would have to come to it, but he didn\u0027t want to shock his tender sensibilities by telling him of it. \n \n \"Them fellers ain\u0027t sewin\u0027 on no buttons. Si,\" he replied; \"they\u0027re skirmishin\u0027.\" \n \n \"Skirmishin\u0027!\" exclaimed Si, opening his eyes very wide. \"I haint seen any signs o\u0027 rebs \u0027round here, \u0027n\u0027 there aint any shootin\u0027 goin\u0027 on, \u0027nless I\u0027ve lost my hearin\u0027. Durned if \u0027t aint the funniest skirmishin\u0027 I ever hearn tell of!\" \n \n \"Now, don\u0027t ax me nuthin\u0027 more \u0027bout it, Si,\" said Shorty. \"All I\u0027m goin\u0027 to tell ye is that the longer ye live the more ye\u0027ll find things out. Let\u0027s flax \u0027round \u0027n\u0027 git supper!\" \n \n A little while after, as Si was squatting on the ground holding the frying-pan over the fire, he saw a strange insect vaguely wandering about on the sleeve of his blouse. It seemed to be looking for something, and Si became interested as he watched it traveling up and down his arm. He had never seen one like it before, and he thought he would like to know what it was. He would have asked Shorty, but his comrade had gone to the spring for water. Casting his eye around he saw the Captain, who chanced to be sauntering through the camp. \n \n The Captain of Co. Q had been the Principal of a seminary in Posey County, and was looked upon with awe by the simple folk as a man who knew about all that was worth knowing. Si thought he might be able to tell him all about the harmless\u0027s-looking little stranger. \n \n So he put down his frying-pan and stepped up to the Captain, holding out his arm and keeping his eye on the insect so that he shouldn\u0027t get away. \n \n \"Good evenin\u0027, Cap.,\" said Si, touching his hat, and addressing him with that familiar disregard of official dignity that characterised the average volunteer, who generally felt that he was just as good as anybody who wore shoulder straps. \n \n \"Good evening, Klegg,\" said the Captain, returning the salute. \n \n \"Say, Cap, you\u0027ve been ter collidge \u0027n\u0027 got filled up with book-larnin\u0027; p\u0027raps ye kin tell me what kind o\u0027 bug this is. I\u0027m jest a little bit curious to know.\" \n \n And Si pointed to the object of his inquiry that was leisurely creeping toward a hole in the elbow of his outer garment. \n \n \"Well, Josiah,\" said the Captain, after a brief inspection, \"I presume I don\u0027t know quite as much as some people think I do; but I guess I can tell you something about that insect. I never had any of them myself, but I\u0027ve read of them.\" \n \n \"Never had \u0027em himself,\" thought Si. \"What \u0027n the world does ha mean?\" And Si\u0027s big eyes opened with wonder and fear at the thought that whatever it was he had \"got \u0027em.\" \n \n \"I suppose,\" continued the Captain, \"you would like to know the scientific name?\" \n \n \"I reck\u0027n that\u0027ll do \u0027s well \u0027s any.\" \n \n \"Well, sir, that is a Pediculus. That\u0027s a Latin word, but it\u0027s his name.\" \n \n \"Purty big name fer such a leetle bug, ain\u0027t it, Perfessor?\" observed Si. \"Name\u0027s big enough for an el\u0027fant er a \u0027potamus.\" \n \n \u0027skirmishing\u0027 103 \n \n \"It may seem so, Klegg; but when you get intimately acquainted with him I think you will find that his name isn\u0027t any too large for him. There is a good deal more of him than you think.\" \n \n The young soldier\u0027s eyes opened still wider. \n \n \"I was going on to tell you,\" continued the Captain, \"that there are several kinds of Pediculi—we don\u0027t say Pediculuses. There is the Pediculus Capitis—Latin again—but it means the kind that lives on the head. I presume when you were a little shaver your mother now and then harrowed your head with a fine-tooth comb?\" \n \n \"Ya-as\" said Si; \"she almost took the hide off sometimes, an\u0027 made me yell like an Injun.\" \n \n \"Now, Klegg, I don\u0027t wish to cause you unnecessary alarm, but I will say that the head insect isn\u0027t a circumstance to this one on your arm. As you would express it, perhaps, he can\u0027t hold a candle to him. This fellow is the Pediculus Corporis!\" \n \n \"I s\u0027pose that means they eats up Corporals!\" said Si. \n \n \"I do not think the Pediculus Corporis confines himself exclusively to Corporals, as his name might indicate,\" said the Captain, laughing at Si\u0027s literal translation and his personal application of the word. \"He no doubt likes a juicy and succulent Corporal, but I don\u0027t believe he is any respecter of persons. That\u0027s my opinion, from what I\u0027ve heard about him. It is likely that I \u0027will be able to speak more definitely, from experience, after a while. Corporis means that he is the kind that pastures on the human body. But there\u0027s one thing more about this fellow, some call him Pediculus Vestimenti; that is because he lives around in the clothing.\" \n \n \"But we don\u0027t wear no vests,\" said Si, taking a practical view of this new word; \"nothin\u0027 but blouses, \u0027n\u0027 pants, \u0027n\u0027 shirts.\" \n \n \"You are too literal, Klegg. That word means any kind of clothes. But I guess I\u0027ve told you as much about him as you care to know at present. If you want any more information, after two or three weeks, come and see me again. I think by that time you will not find it necessary to ask any more questions.\" \n \n Si went back to his cooking, with the Pediculus still on his arm. He wanted to show it to Shorty. The Captain\u0027s profound explanation, with its large words, was a little too much for Si. He did not yet clearly comprehend the matter, and as he walked thoughtfully to where Shorty was \"bilin\u0027\" the coffee he was trying to get through his head what it all meant. \n \n \"Hello, Si,\" said Shorty; \"whar ye bin? What d\u0027ye mean, goin\u0027 off \u0027n\u0027 leavin\u0027 yer sowbelly half done?\" \n \n \"Sh-h!\" replied Si. \"Ye needn\u0027t git yer back up about it. Bin talkin\u0027 to the Cap\u0027n. Shorty, look at that \u0027ere bug!\" \n \n And Si pointed to the object of the Captain\u0027s lecture on natural history that was still creeping on his arm. Shorty slapped his thigh and burst into a loud laugh. \n \n \"Was that what ye went to see the Cap\u0027n \u0027bout?\" he asked as soon as he could speak. \n \n \"Why—ya-as,\" replied Si, somewhat surprised at Shorty\u0027s unseemly levity. \"I saw that thing crawlin\u0027 round, \u0027n\u0027 I was a-wonderin\u0027 what it was, fer I never seen one afore. I knowed Cap was a scolard, \u0027n\u0027 a perfesser, \u0027n\u0027 all that \u0027n\u0027 I \u0027lowed he c\u0027d tell me all about it. So I went \u0027n\u0027 axed him.\" \n \n \"What\u0027d he tell ye?\" \n \n \"He told me lots o\u0027 big, heathenish words, \u0027n\u0027 said this bug was a ridiculous, or suthin\u0027 like that.\" \n \n \"\u0027Diculus be blowed!\" said Shorty, \"The ole man was a\u0027stuffin\u0027 ye. I\u0027ll tell ye what that is, Si,\" he added solemnly, \"that\u0027s a grayback!\" \n \n \"A grayback!\" said Si. \"I\u0027ve hearn \u0027em call the Johnnies graybacks, but I didn\u0027t know \u0027s there was any other kind.\" \n \n \"I reck\u0027n \u0027twont be long, now, till yer catches on ter the meanin\u0027 ol what a grayback is. Ye\u0027ll know all \u0027bout it purty sudden. This ain\u0027t the first one I ever seen.\" \n \n Si was impressed, as he had often been before, by Shorty\u0027s superior wisdom and experience. \n \n \"See here. Si,\" Shorty continued, as his eye suddenly lighted up with a brilliant thought, \"I guess I kin make ye understand what a grayback is. What d\u0027ye call that coat ye\u0027ve got on?\" \n \n \"Why, that\u0027s a fool question; it\u0027s a blouse, of course!\" \n \n \"Jesso!\" said Shorty. \"Now, knock off the fust letter o\u0027 that word, \u0027n\u0027 see what ye got left!\" \n \n Si looked at Shorty as if he thought his conundrums were an indication of approaching idiocy. Then he said, half to himself: \n \n \"Let\u0027s see! Blouse—blouse—take off the \u0027b\u0027 \u0027n\u0027 she spells l-o-u-s-e, louse! Great Scott, Shorty, is that a louse?\" \n \n \"That\u0027s jest the size of it. Si. Ye\u0027ll have millions of \u0027em \u0027fore the war\u0027s over \u0027f they don\u0027t hurry up the cakes.\" \n \n Si looked as if he would like to dig a hole in the ground, get into it, and have Shorty cover him up. \n \n \"Why didn\u0027t the Cap\u0027n tell me it was that? He said suthin\u0027 about ridiculus corporalis, and I thought he was makin\u0027 fun o\u0027 me. He said these bugs liked to eat fat Corporals.\u0027 \n \n \"I reck\u0027n that\u0027s so,\" replied Shorty; \"but they likes other people jest as well—even a skinny feller like me. They lunches off\u0027n privits, \u0027n\u0027 Corp\u0027rils, \u0027n\u0027 Kurnals, \u0027n\u0027 Gin\u0027rals, all the same. They ain\u0027t satisfied with three square meals a day, nuther; they jest eats right along all the time \u0027tween regular meals. They allus gits hungry in the night, too, and chaws a feller up while he sleeps. They don\u0027t give ye no show at all. I rayther think the graybacks likes the ossifers best if they could have their ch\u0027ice, \u0027cause they\u0027s fatter \u0027n the privits; they gits better grub.\" \n \n Si fairly turned pale as he contemplated the picture so graphically portrayed by Shorty. The latter\u0027s explanation was far more effectual in letting the light in upon Si\u0027s mind than the scientific disquisition of the \"Perfesser.\" He had now a pretty clear idea of what a \"grayback\" was. Whatever he lacked to make his knowledge complete was soon supplied in the regular way. But Si was deeply grieved and shocked at what Shorty had told him. It was some minutes before he said anything more. \n \n \"Shorty,\" he said, with a sadness in his tone that would almost have moved a mule to tears, \"who\u0027d a-thought rd ever git as low down \u0027s this, to have them all-fired graybacks, \u0027s ye call \u0027em, crawlin\u0027 over me. How\u0027d mother feel if she knew about \u0027em. She wouldn\u0027t sleep a wink fer a month!\" \n \n \"Ye\u0027ll have to come to it. Si. All the soljers does, from the Major-Gin\u0027rals down to the tail-end of the mule-whackers. Ye mind them \u0027Sconsin chaps we was lookin\u0027 at a little bit ago?\" \n \n \"Yes,\" said Si. \n \n \"Well, graybacks was what ailed \u0027em. The fellers with their shirts on their knees was killin\u0027 \u0027em off. That\u0027s what they calls \u0027skirmishin\u0027. There\u0027s other kinds o\u0027 skirmishing besides fitin\u0027 rebels! Ye\u0027d better git rid of that one on yer arm, if he hasn\u0027t got inside already; then there\u0027ll be one less of \u0027em.\" \n \n Si found him after a short search, and proposed to get a chip, carry him to the fire and throw him in. \n \n \"Naw!\" said Shorty in disgust, \"that\u0027s no way. Lemme show yer how!\" \n \n \u0027naw! Lemme Show Ye How!\u0027 107 \n \n Shorty placed one thumb-nail on each side of the insect. There was a quick pressure, a snap like the crack of a percussion cap, and all was over. \n \n Si shuddered, and wondered if he could ever engage in such a work of slaughter. \n \n \"D\u0027ye s\u0027pose,\" he said to Shorty, \"that there\u0027s any more of \u0027em on me?\" And he began to hitch his shoulders about, and to feel a desire to put his fingers to active use. \n \n \"Shouldn\u0027t wonder,\" replied Shorty. \"Mebbe I\u0027ve got \u0027em, to. Let\u0027s go out\u0027n do a little skirmishin\u0027 ourselves.\" \n \n \"We\u0027d better go off a good ways,\" said Si, \"so\u0027s the boys won\u0027t see us.\" \n \n \"You\u0027re too nice and pertickler for a soljer. Si. They\u0027ll all be doin\u0027 it, even the Cap\u0027n himself, by termorrer or nex\u0027 day.\" \n \n They went out back of the camp, where Si insisted on getting behind the largest tree he could find. Then they sat down and engaged in that exciting chase of the Pediculus up and down the seams of their garments, so familiar to all who wore either the blue or the gray. Thousands of nice young men who are now preachers and doctors and lawyers and statesmen, felt just as bad about it at first as Si did. \n \n \"Shorty,\" said Si, as they slowly walked back to eat their supper, which had been neglected in the excitement of the hour, \"before Co. Q left Posey County to jine the rigiment a feller \u0027t was home on furlow told me ter let my finger-nails grow long \u0027n\u0027 sharp. He said I\u0027d need \u0027em. I didn\u0027t know what he meant then, but I b\u0027lieve I do now.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63199.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
