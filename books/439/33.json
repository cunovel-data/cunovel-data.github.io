{"id":45068,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER IX. VICTORY AT LAST","content":"SI REAPPEARS AS FROM THE GRAVE, WITH AN APPETITE LIKE PRAIRIE FIRE. \\n\\n \\n\\n ON THEIR way back from \"settling the battery,\" Si and Shorty each broke off a big armful of cedar branches. These they spread down on the ground when the regiment resumed its place in the line-of-battle, and lay down on them to spend the rest of the night as comfortably as possible. The fire with which they had roasted the pig, and from which they had drawn much comfort during the day, had had to be extinguished when darkness came on. But it had dried out and warmed the ground for a considerable space around, and on this they made their bed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We seem to play in fair luck right along, Shorty,\" said the hopeful Si, as they curled up on the boughs. \"Most of the boys \u0027ve got to lay down in a foot of mud.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t get to crowin\u0027 too loud,\" grumbled Shorty. \"If they find out what a good thing we have, some Jigadier-Brindle\u0027ll snatch it away for himself.\" But Si was fast asleep before Shorty finished speaking. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sometime before midnight the Orderly-Sergeant came around, and after vigorous kicking and shaking, succeeded in waking them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Get up,\" he said, \"and draw some rations. The wagons\u0027ve got in from Nashville.\"108 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My gracious!\" said Si, as soon as he was wide enough awake to understand the Orderly-Sergeant\u0027s words, \"is it possible that we\u0027re going to have plenty of hardtack and pork and coffee again? Seems to me a hundred years since we drew a full ration.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He and Shorty jumped up and ran over to where the Quartermaster-Sergeant and his assistants were dealing out a handful of crackers and a piece of pork to each man as he came up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mebbe I oughtn\u0027t to say it,\" said Si, as he munched away, taking a bite first off the crackers in his right and then off the meat in his left, \"but nothing that ever mother baked tasted quite as good as this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This does seem to be a specially good lot,\" assented Shorty. \"Probably a wagon load that they intended for the officers and give us by mistake. Better eat it all up before they find it out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The morning of Jan. 2, 1863, dawned bleak and chill, but this at least brought the great comfort that the dreary rain was at last over. The sharp air was bracing, and put new life and hope into the hearts of the union soldiers. Many wagons had been gotten up during the night, bringing food and ammunition for all. Soon after daylight cheerful fires were blazing everywhere, and the morning air was laden with the appetizing fragrance of boiling coffee and broiling meat. The sun began to rise over Murfreesboro\u0027 and the rebel camps, giving promise of a bright, invigorating day. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope this thing\u0027ll be brought to a focus to-day, and the question settled as to who shall occupy this piece of real estate,\" said Shorty, as he and Si109 finished a generous breakfast, filled their boxes and pockets with cartridges, and began knocking the dried mud off their clothes and rubbing the rust from their guns. \"I want them gents in brown clothes to clear out and leave. It frets me to see them hangin\u0027 \u0027round. They\u0027re bad neighbors.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope,\" said Si, carefully picking out the tube of his gun with a pin, \"we won\u0027t put in to-day as we did yesterday layin\u0027 \u0027round making faces an\u0027 shakin\u0027 our fists at one another. Let\u0027s have the thing out at once.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Evidently the rebels were of the same frame of mind. They saluted the dawn with a noisy fusillade that ran along the miles of winding line. It was spiteful, crashing and persistent, but as the union lines lay beyond good musket range and the rebels showed no disposition to advance across the fields and come to close quarters, the noise was quite out of proportion to the harm done. \\n\\n \\n\\n The two rebel batteries on the opposite side of the river opened up a terrific fire upon one of our batteries, and the air seemed torn to shreds by the storm of howling missiles. \\n\\n \\n\\n The 200th Ind. was too far away to have more than a spectacular interest in this tempestuous episode. They stood around their gun-stacks and watched and listened while the hours passed in ineffective noise, and wondered when the crisis of action was going to arrive. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They seem to have lost their appetite for close acquaintance with the 200th Ind.,\" remarked Shorty. \"They found that Jordan was a hard road to travel whenever they came across the fields at us, and are110 tryin\u0027 to scare us by makin\u0027 a racket. I think we kin stand it as long as their powder kin. But I\u0027m gittin\u0027 hungry agin. Let\u0027s have somethin\u0027 to eat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good gracious, it is noon,\" answered Si, looking up at the sun. \"I believe I do want some dinner.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They had scarcely finished dinner-eating when the 200th Ind. was ordered to move over toward Stone River. It halted on a little rise of ground on the bank, which commanded an extensive view on both sides of the river. There was a portentous flow in the great, dark-blue sea of men. The billows, crested with shining steel, were rolling eastward toward the river. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Something\u0027s goin\u0027 to happen; meetin\u0027s about to break up; school\u0027s goin\u0027 to let out,\" said Shorty eagerly. \"Isn\u0027t it a grand sight.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gracious me!\" said Si, devouring the spectacle with his eyes. \"How I wish that father and mother and sister could see all this. It\u0027s worth going through a great deal to see this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was by far the most imposing spectacle they had yet seen. The whole Army of the Cumberland was crowded into the narrow space between the Nashville Pike and Stone River. Its compact regiments, brigades, and divisions showed none of the tearing and mangling they had endured, but stood or moved in well-dressed ranks that seemed the embodiment of mighty purpose and resistless force. \\n\\n \\n\\n Around its grand array, a half mile away, lay the somber, portentous line of brown-clad men. Beyond them rose the steeples and roofs of the sleepy old town of Murfreesboro\u0027, with crowds of men and women occupying every point of vantage, to witness the renewal of the awful battle.111 \\n\\n \\n\\n It was now long past noon. The bright sun had long ago scattered the chill mists of the morning, and radiated warmth and light over the dun landscape. Even the somber cedars lost some of the funereal gloom they wore when the skies were lowering. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There go two brigades across the river,\" said Si. \"We\u0027re goin\u0027 to try to turn their right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They saw a long line of men file down the river bank, cross, and go into line on the high ground beyond. Their appearance seemed to stir the brown mass lying on the hights a mile in front of them to action. The rebels began swarming out of their works and moving forward into the woods. \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently a thin line of men in butternut-colored clothes ran forward to a fence in front, and began throwing it down. Behind them came three long, brown lines, extending from near the river to the woods far away to the left. Batteries galloped in the intervals to knolls, on which they unlimbered and opened fire. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was an overpowering mass of men for the two little brigades to resist. Si\u0027s heart almost stood still as he saw the inequality of the contest. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t they send us over there to help those men?\" he anxiously asked. \"They can\u0027t stand up against that awful crowd.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just wait,\" said Shorty hopefully. \"Old Rosy knows what he\u0027s doin\u0027. He\u0027s got enough here for the business.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The artillery all along the line burst out in torrents of shells, but Si\u0027s eyes were glued on the two little brigades. He saw the white spurts from the skirmishers\u0027 rifles, and men drop among the rebels,112 who yet moved slowly forward, like some all-engulfing torrent. The skirmishers ran back to the main line, and along its front sped a burst of smoke as each regiment fired by volley. The foremost rebel line quivered a little, but moved steadily on. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then a cloud of white smoke hid both union and rebel lines, and from it came the sound as of thousands of carpenters hammering away industriously at nails. \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently Si was agonized to see a fringe of blue break back from the bank of smoke, and run rapidly to the rear. They were followed by regiments falling back slowly, in order, and turning at the word of command to deliver volleys in the faces of their yell ing pursuers. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si looked at his Colonel, and saw him anxiously watching the brigade commander for orders to rush across the river to the assistance of the two brigades. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly there was a whirl in front. A battery galloped up, the drivers lashing the horses, the cannoneers sitting stolidly on the limbers with their arms folded. It swept by to a knoll in front and to the right, which commanded the other side of the river. Instantly the gunners sprang to the ground, the cannon were tossed about as if they were play things, and before Si could fairly wink he saw the guns lined up on the bank, the drivers standing by the horses\u0027 heads, and the cannons belching savagely into the flanks of the horde of rebels. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then another battery swept up alongside the first, and another, until 58 guns crowned the high banks and thundered until the earth shook as with the ague. A deluge of iron swept the fields where the mighty113 host of rebels were advancing. Tops were torn out of trees and fell with a crash, fence-rails and limbs of oak went madly flying through the air, regiments and brigades disappeared before the awful blast. \\n\\n \\n\\n For a few minutes Si and Shorty stood appalled at the deafening crash and the shocking destruction. Then they saw the rebels reel and fly before the tornado of death.114 \\n\\n \\n\\n A great shout arose from thousands of excited men standing near. Regiments and brigades started as with one impulse to rush across the river and pursue the flying enemy. The 200th Ind. was one of these. No one heard any orders from the officers. The men caught the contagion of victory and rushed forward, sweeping with them the lately-defeated brigades, hurrying over the wreckage of the cannon-fire, over the thickly-strewn dead and wounded, and gathering in prisoners, flags and cannon. \\n\\n \\n\\n They went on so, nearly to the breastworks behind which the rebels were seeking shelter. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si and Shorty were among the foremost. A few hundred yards from the rebel works Si fell to the ground without a groan. Shorty saw him, and ran to him. The side of his head was covered with blood, and he was motionless. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si Klegg Fell Without a Groan 113 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stone dead—bullet plum through his head,\" said the agonized Shorty. But there was no time for mourning the fallen. The pursuit was still hot, and Shorty\u0027s duty was in front. He ran ahead until the Colonel halted the regiment. Fresh rebels were lining up in the breastworks and threatening a return charge which would be disastrous. The Colonel hastily re-formed the regiment to meet this, and slowly withdrew it in good order to resist any counter-attack. After marching a mile or more the regiment halted and went into bivouac. The rejoicing men started great fires and set about getting supper. But the saddened Shorty had no heart for rejoicing over the victory, or for supper. He drew off from the rest, sat down at the roots of an oak, wrapped the cape of his overcoat about his face, and115 abandoned himself to his bitter grief. Earth had no more joy for him. He wished he had been shot at the same time his partner was. He could think of nothing but that poor boy lying there dead and motionless on the cold ground. He felt that he could never think of anything else, and the sooner he was shot the better it would be. \\n\\n \\n\\n The other boys respected his grief At first they tried to tempt him to eat something and drink some coffee, but Shorty would not listen to them, and they drew away, that he might be alone. \\n\\n \\n\\n He sat thus for some hours. The loss of their sturdy Corporal saddened the whole company, and as they sat around their fires after supper they ex tolled his good traits, recounted his exploits, and easily made him out the best soldier in the regiment. \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently the fifes and rums played tattoo, and the boys began preparations for turning in. \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty had become nearly frozen sitting there motionless, and he got up and went to the fire to thaw out. He had just picked up a rail to lay it on the fire in better shape, when he heard a weak voice in quiring: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does anybody know where the 200th Ind. is?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty dropped the rail as if he had been shot, and rushed in the direction of the voice. In an instant he came back almost carrying Si Klegg. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a hubbub around the fire that kept everybody from paying the least attention to \"taps.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, it\u0027s really me,\" said Si, responding as well as he was able to the hearty handshakings. \"And I ain\u0027t no ghost, neither. I\u0027ve got an appetite on me like a prairie fire, and if you fellers are really glad116 to see me you\u0027ll hustle up here all the grub in the Commissary Department. I can eat every mite of it. I was hit by a spent ball and knocked senseless. But I ain\u0027t going to tell you any more till I get something to eat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63220.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
