{"id":45140,"no":105,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. NO PEACE FOR SI AND SHORTY","content":"THE YOUNGSTERS KEEP THEM BUSY WHILE THE TRAIN MOVES SOUTH. THE long fast had sharpened the zest the boys had for their first \"soldier-breakfast.\" Until they got down to \"real soldier-living\" they could not feel that they were actually in the service. To have this formal initiation in the historic city of Nashville, far in the interior of the Southern Confederacy, was an exhiliarating event. The coarse fare became viands of rare appetency. \"Gracious, how good these beans taste,\" murmured Harry Joslyn, calling for a second plateful; \"never knowed beans to taste so good before. Wonder how they cook \u0027em? We\u0027ll have to learn how, Gid, so\u0027s to cook \u0027em for ourselves, and when we git back home won\u0027t we astonish our mothers and sisters?\" \"And sich coffee,\" echoed Gid. \"I\u0027ll never drink cream in my coffee agin. I hadn\u0027t no idee cream spiled coffee so. Why, this coffee\u0027s the best stuff I ever drunk. Beats maple sap, or cider through a straw, all holler. That\u0027s good enough for boys. This \u0027s what men and soldiers drink.\" \"You know those old gods and goddesses,\" put in Montmorency Scruggs, a pale, studious boy, for shortness called \"Monty,\" and who had a great likeness for ancient history and expected to be a lawyer, \"drunk what they called nectar. Maybe it was something like this.\" \"But we haven\u0027t had any hardtack yet,\" complained Albert Russell, a youth somewhat finicky as to dress, and who had ambitions of becoming a doctor. \"They\u0027ve only given us baker\u0027s bread, same as we got on the other side of the river, only better-tasting. Why don\u0027t they give us real soldier bread? I\u0027ve heard Uncle Bob laugh at the \u0027soft-bread snoozers,\u0027 who never got near enough the front to know the taste of hardtack.\" \"Well, I\u0027m going to eat all I can of it while I can get it,\" said little Pete Skidmore, the youngest and smallest of the lot, who had only passed the Mustering Officer by exhibiting such a vehement desire to enter the service as to make up for his probable lack of years and quite evident lack of inches. \"I\u0027ve heard Uncle Will say that he was always mighty glad to get back where he could get soft bread for a change, after he\u0027d worn his grinders down to the quick chawing hardtack. It tastes awful good, anyway.\" \"The Government must pay big wages to the men it hires to do its cooking,\" philosophized Harry Joslyn, \"same as it does to its lawyers and Congressmen and Generals. No common men could cook grub that way. Mebbe it took the cooks away from the Astor House and Delmonico\u0027s.\" \"The boys are certainly making up for lost time,\" complacently remarked Shorty, as, having taken off the edge of his own hunger with a plateful of pork-and-beans and a half loaf of bread, he stopped for a moment to survey the havoc that his young charges, ranged at a long, rough counter, were making in the Commissary stores. \"They\u0027re eatin\u0027 as if this was the last square meal they expected to git till the rebellion\u0027s put down.\" \"Yes,\" laughed Si, emptying his second cup of coffee, \"I used to think that we had appetites that\u0027d browse a five-acre lot off clean every meal, but these kids kin distance us. If they live off the country its bones \u0027ll be picked mighty white when they pass. That lean, lank Gid Mackall seems to be as holler as a sassidge-skin. Even that wouldn\u0027t give room for all that he\u0027s stowin\u0027 away.\" \"Harry Joslyn \u0027s runnin\u0027 nose-and-nose with him. There ain\u0027t the width o\u0027 their forelocks difference. Harry\u0027s yelled for more beans at the same second that Gid has. In fact, not one of \u0027em has lagged. They\u0027re a great gang, I tell you, but I wouldn\u0027t want to board any one of \u0027em for six bits a week.\" Maj. Oglesvie came up. \"Serg\u0027t Klegg,\" said he, \"the Quartermaster says that he\u0027s got a train load of ammunition to send forward, but he\u0027s scarce of guards. I thought of your squad. Don\u0027t you think you could take charge of it? I don\u0027t imagine there is much need of a guard, for things have been pretty quiet down the road for some weeks. Still, it isn\u0027t right to send off so important a train without any protection.\" \"Only be too glad of the dooty, sir,\" answered Si, saluting. \"It\u0027ll give the boys something to think of besides hanging guerrillas. Besides, they\u0027re just crazy to git hold o\u0027 guns. Where kin I git muskets for \u0027em?\" \"March them right over to that shed there,\" said the Major, \"and the Quartermaster will issue them muskets and equipments, which you can turn over again when you reach Chattanooga. Good-by. I hope you\u0027ll have a pleasant trip. Remember me to the boys of the old brigade and tell them I\u0027ll be with them before they start out for Atlanta.\" \"Purty slouchy bizniss that, givin\u0027 these kids guns before they\u0027ve had any drill at all—don\u0027t know even the facin\u0027s, let alone the manual of arms,\" remarked Shorty doubtfully, as they marched over to the shed. \"They\u0027ll be shooting holes through each others\u0027 heads and the tops o\u0027 the cars, and\u0027ll waste more ammynition than a six-mule team kin haul. They\u0027ll make a regler Fourth o\u0027 July from here to Chattynoogy.\" \"Don\u0027t be worried about them boys,\" Si reassured him. \"Every one of \u0027em is used to handlin\u0027 guns. Then, we kin keep the catridges ourselves and not issue any till they\u0027re needed, which they mayn\u0027t be.\" The boys were in a buzz of delight at getting the guns they had so longed for, and Si\u0027s first duty was to end an exuberant bayonet fencing match between Gid and Harry which was imitated all along the line. \"Stop that,\" he called. \"Put your minds to learnin\u0027 to load and shoot first. It\u0027ll be some time before you git a chance to prod a rebel with a bayonet. Rebels are as wild as crows. You\u0027ll be lucky to git as close to \u0027em as the other side of a 40-acre field.\" \"But s\u0027posin\u0027 a rebel runs at you with his bayonet,\" expostulated Harry Joslyn, \"oughtn\u0027t you to know how to ward him off and settle him?\" \"The best way\u0027s to settle him jest as he comes over the hill, half-a-mile away, with an ounce o\u0027 cold lead put where he lives. That\u0027ll take the pint offen his bayonet mighty certainly.\" Si and Shorty showed the boys how to put on the belts carrying the cap- and cartridge-boxes, and gave them a little dumb-show instruction in loading and firing, ending with exhibiting to them a cartridge, and the method of tearing it with the teeth and putting it in the gun. \"Now give us some catridges,\" clamored the boys, \"and let us do some real shooting.\" \"No,\" said Si; \"we\u0027ll keep the catridges ourselves, and issue them to you when the enemy comes in sight.\" \"Nice time to give out catridges then,\" grumbled Harry Joslyn. \"When we see the rebels we want to begin shootin\u0027 instid o\u0027 botherin\u0027 you with questions. You wouldn\u0027t kill many coons if you had to run back to the house for your powder and lead after you saw the coon before you could shoot him.\" \"Well, you can\u0027t have no catridges now,\" said Si decisively. \"We\u0027re not likely to see any coons before we git to Murfreesboro. Then we\u0027ll see how things look further down the road. Take off your bayonets, all o\u0027 you, and pile into them rear cars there. Stow yourselves around and be as comfortable as you kin.\" The boys preferred the tops of the cars to the inside, and scattered themselves along the length of the train to view the war-worn country of which they had heard so much from their relatives who had campaigned there. Si settled himself down in the car to read the morning papers which he had gotten in Nashville, and Shorty, producing a pack of new cards, began a studious practice, with reference to future operations in Chattanooga. The train was slowing down for the bridge near Lavergne, when there came a single shot, followed by a splutter of them and loud yells. There Was a Chorus of Yells, and then Another Volley. 247 Exceedingly startled, Si and Shorty sprang up, seized their guns, bounded to the door and looked out. They could see nothing to justify the alarm. There was not a rebel, mounted or unmounted, in sight. In the road below were two or three army teams dragging their slow way along, with their drivers yelling and laughing at a negro, whose mule was careering wildly across the fenceless field. The negro had been apparently jogging along, with a collection of plunder he had picked up in an abandoned camp strung upon his mule, when the latter had become alarmed at the firing and scattered his burden in every direction. The rider was succeeding in holding on by clinging desperately to the mule\u0027s neck. Si set his gun down and clambered up the side of the car. \"What\u0027s all that shootin\u0027 about?\" he demanded of Harry Joslyn. \"I didn\u0027t mean it, sir,\" Harry explained. \"I was just aiming my gun at things I see along the road—just trying the sights like. A turkey-buzzard lighted on a stump out there, and I guess I must have forgot myself and cocked my gun, for it went off. Then Gid, seeing me miss, tried to show he was a better shot, and he banged away and missed, too, and then the other boys, they had to try their hands, and they belted away, one after another, and they all missed. I guess we didn\u0027t count as we ougther\u0027ve done on the goin\u0027 forward o\u0027 the train, because we all struck much nearer than we expected to that nigger on a mule, and scared his mule nigh out o\u0027 his skin. We really didn\u0027t intend no harm.\" \"Where did you git catridges?\" demanded Si. \"Why, that box that Alf Russell got was half full. He tried to keep \u0027em all hisself, and intended to shoot \u0027em off, one by one, to make the rest of us envious. Alf always was a pig in school, and never would divide his apples or doughnuts with the other boys. But we see them almost as quick as he did, an\u0027 Gid and me set down on him suddently, as he was lying on the roof, and took away all his catridges, and give \u0027em around to the rest o\u0027 the boys, one a-piece.\" \"Are they all gone now?\" \"Yes, sir; every one shot away,\" answered Harry regretfully. Si looked through several of the boxes and at some of the guns to assure himself of this. He gave those near him a lecture on their offense, and then climbed down into the car and resumed his paper, while Shorty was soon immersed again in the abstruse study of the relation of the cross-barred designs on the back of the cards to the numbers and suits of their faces. They had passed Lavergne, and were approaching Stewart\u0027s Creek, when another startling rattle of musketry broke out, this time from the forepart of the train. \"Now, great Scott, what\u0027s up?\" said Si angrily, as he quickly surveyed the surrounding country. He saw that they were not attacked, and then clambered to the top of the car, where he noticed little wreaths of powder-smoke lingering around the squad in which were Jim Humphreys, little Pete Skidmore and Wes. Brown. \"What\u0027re you young whelps shootin\u0027 for?\" demanded Si. They were all so abashed at his sternness that they could not find their tongues for reply, until little Pete piped up: \"Why we\u0027ve bin talkin\u0027 to the train men, and they said they wuz shot at wunst, about a year ago, from that swamp back there, and we got some catridges from them, and we thought we saw something moving in there, though Jim Humphreys said it wuz only burned stumps that we took for men, and them other boys back there had bin shootin\u0027 off their gunn and tryin\u0027 \u0027em, and we thought we could too—\" \"You little brats,\" said Si; \"didn\u0027t you hear my orders about firin\u0027 before we started? If another boy shoots without my orders I\u0027ll tie him up by the thumbs! Got any more catridges? Give me every one of \u0027em.\" The boys all protested that every cartridge was gone. Si assured himself of this by examination, savagely scored the train men for giving them ammunition and threatened trouble if any more was, and having relieved his mind returned to his paper in the caboose-car. The train ran on to a switch where there was another carrying a regiment going home on veteran furlough. Si and Shorty knew some of the men, and in the pleasure of meeting them and in hearing all the news from the front forgot that their boys were mingling with the others and being filled full of the preposterous stories with which veterans delight to stuff new recruits. Finally the whistles gave notice that the trains would move. Si got his boys back on the cars, and renewing his caution about taking care of themselves, holding on tightly and looking out for overhanging branches, returned with Shorty to their car and their occupations. \"We\u0027re comin\u0027 to Stewart\u0027s Crick, Shorty,\" said Si, looking up from his paper. \"Recollect that hill ovyr there? That\u0027s where they had that battery that the Colonel thought we wuz goin\u0027 to git. Great Scott, the mud and briars in that old field!\" \"Yes,\" said Shorty, negligently, with his eyes fixed on the backs of the cards. \"But that\u0027s ancient history. Say, I\u0027ve got these marks down fine at last. They\u0027re just as plain as A, B, C. You see, when that corner o\u0027 the square comes out clear to the edge it\u0027s clubs, every time, and there\u0027s just as many spots as there is of lines—\" He was interrupted by a volley, apparently from every gun on the roofs of the cars. Then a chorus of shrill, treble, boyish yells, and next instant another volley. The two sprang to the door and looked out. Not a sign of a rebel anywhere. Si went up one side of the car, Shorty the other. They ran along the tops of the cars, storming at the boys, kicking them and bumping their heads against the boards to make them stop. When they succeeded Si sternly ordered every one of them to leave the roofs and come down into the cars. When he had gathered them there he demanded: \"Now, I want to know at once what this means?\" Little Pete Skidmore again became the spokesman of the abashed crowd. \"Why, them men back there on the switch cautioned us above all things not to let the rebels git the drop on us when we come to that crick; that we wouldn\u0027t see nothin\u0027 of \u0027em—nothin\u0027 but a low bank, behind which they wuz hid, with their guns pokin\u0027 through the brush, but the moment we see the bank breastwork throwed up along the crick we must let into it. That\u0027s what it\u0027s for. The rebels throwed it up to hide behind. Them men said that the brush back there was as full o\u0027 rebels as a hound o\u0027 fleas, and that we must let into \u0027em the moment we see the bank, or they\u0027d git the drop on us. They had an awful time there theirselves, and they gave us all the catridges they had left for us to use.\" \"You little numbskulls,\" said Si; \"why didn\u0027t you come to use and tell us about this?\" \"They told us to be partickeler and say nothin\u0027 to you. Your stayin\u0027 back there in the car showed that you didn\u0027t know nothin\u0027 about it; you hadn\u0027t bin down this way for a long time and wasn\u0027t up to the latest improvements, and you wuz jest as like as not to run us into a hornets\u0027 nest; that you wuzzent our real officers, anyway, and it didn\u0027t much matter to you what happened to us.\" \"Our own sins are comin\u0027 back on us. Shorty,\" remarked Si. \"This is a judgment on you for the way you\u0027ve filled up recruits at every chance you got.\" \"\u0027Taint on me,\" said Shorty, shrugging his shoulders. \"I\u0027m not in command. You are.\" \"I shall be mighty glad when we git this outfit to Chattanoogy,\" sighed Si. \"I\u0027m gittin\u0027 older every minute that I have \u0027em on my hands.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63292.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
