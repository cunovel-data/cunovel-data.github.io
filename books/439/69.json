{"id":45104,"no":69,"title":"CHAPTER III. THIRD DAY OF THE DELUGE","content":"TOILSOME PLODDING, AND \"SHELBYVILLE ONLY 15 MILES AWAY.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n IT SEEMS impossible, but the third day\u0027s rain was even worse than that of the two preceding. The drops seemed much larger, to follow each other faster, and with less interval between the downpours. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does it always rain this way in June down here?\" Si asked a patriarch, who was sitting on his porch by the roadside in a split-bottomed rocking-chair, resting his bony hands on a cane, the head of which was a ram\u0027s horn, smoking a corn-cob pipe and watching the passing column with lack-luster eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sah,\" said the sage, poking down the ashes in his pipe with his little finger, \"I\u0027ve done lived in the Duck River Valley ever sence Capting Jimmy Madison wuz elected President the fust time, and I never seed sich a wet spell as this afore. I reckon hit\u0027s all along o\u0027 the wah. We allers have a powerful sight o\u0027 rain in wah times. Hit rained powerful when Jinerul Jackson wuz foutin\u0027 the Injuns down at Hoss Shoe Bend, and the Summers durin\u0027 the Mexican war wuz mouty wet, but they didn\u0027t hold a candle to what we\u0027re havin\u0027 this yeah. Hit\u0027s the shootin\u0027 and bangin\u0027, I reckon, that jostles the clouds so\u0027s they can\u0027t hold in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How far is it to Shelbyville, Gran\u0027pap?\" asked Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027don\u0027t Call Me Your Gran\u0027pap.\u0027 37 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t call me yer gran-pap,\" piped out the old man in angry falsetto, and shaking his cane. \"I won\u0027t stand hit. I won\u0027t stand everything. I\u0027ve had enough ter stand from you Yankees already. You\u0027ve stole my chickens an\u0027 robbed my smoke-house, an\u0027 run off my stock, an\u0027 I\u0027ve done stood hit, but I won\u0027t stan\u0027 bein\u0027 called gran\u0027pap by ye. I\u0027ve some mouty mean grandsons, some that orter be in the penitentiary, but I hain\u0027t none mean enough t\u0027 be in the Yankee army.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We didn\u0027t mean no offense, sir,\" said Si placatingly. \"We really don\u0027t want you for a gran\u0027father. We\u0027ve got gran\u0027fathers o\u0027 our own, and they\u0027re very nice old men, that we wouldn\u0027t trade off for anything ever raised in Tennessee. Have you anything to eat that you\u0027ll sell us? We\u0027ll pay you for it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I haint got nothin\u0027 nary mite,\" quavered the old man. \"Your men an\u0027 our men have stole everything I have stock, cattle, sheep, hogs, poultry, meat an\u0027 meal everything, except my bare land an\u0027 my hope o\u0027 heaven. Thank God, none on ye kin steal them from me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be too blamed sure about that, old feller,\" said Shorty. \"Better hide \u0027em. The Maumee Muskrats are jest behind us. They\u0027re the worst thieves in the whole army. Don\u0027t let \u0027em know anything about your land or your hope o\u0027 salvation, or they\u0027ll have it in their haversacks before you kin wink.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You haint told us yit how far it is to Shelbyville,\" said Si. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Young man,\" said the sage oracularly, \"that altogether depends. Sometimes Shelbyville is mouty fur off, an\u0027 sometimes she is right here. On bright, cl\u0027ar days, when the roads is good, hit\u0027s only a few steps over thar jest two sees an\u0027 a holler.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s that?\" said Si. \"Two sees an\u0027 a holler? How far is that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He means,\" explained Shorty, \"that you go as far as you kin see from the highest hilltop to the next highest hill-top twice, and then it\u0027s only about as much farther as your voice will reach.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jest so,\" asserted the patriarch. \"I kin saddle my ole nag arter dinner, rack over an\u0027 do some tradin\u0027, an\u0027 rack back agin in time for supper. But \u0027when we have sich sorry weather as this, Shelbyville seems on t\u0027 other side o\u0027 nowhar. You\u0027ve got t\u0027 pull through the mud an\u0027 swim every branch and crick, an\u0027 you\u0027re mouty lucky if you git thar in a week.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you build bridges over the creeks?\" asked Si. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can\u0027t do hit when hit\u0027s rainin\u0027 an they\u0027re runnin\u0027 over thar banks.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But why don\u0027t you do it when the weather\u0027s good?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s the use? You kin git over all right then.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sir,\" said the Brigadier-General, riding up and addressing the old man, \"where does the Shakerag road come into the Bellbuckle road?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Instantly the old man felt that he was being asked to give \"aid and information to the enemy,\" and his old eyes grew hard and his wrinkled face set. \"I don\u0027t know, sah.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, you do,\" said the Brigadier-General impatiently, \"and I want you to tell me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, sah,\" repeated the old man. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are there any works thrown up and any men out there on the Shakerag road?\" asked the Brigadier. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, sah.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did a large body of rebels go past your house yesterday, and which road did they take at the forks?\" inquired the Brigadier. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, sah.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Brigadier-General was not in the best of humor, and he chafed visibly at the old man\u0027s answers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does not Goober Creek run down there about a mile in that direction?\" he again inquired, pointing with his field-glasses. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, sah.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How long have you lived here?\" asked the Brigadier savagely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nigh on to 55 year, sah.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you don\u0027t know where Goober Creek is, and which way it runs?\" asked the Brigadier, losing all patience. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, sah,\" responded the imperturbable old man. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said the Brigadier-General grimly, \"it is high time that you discovered that interesting stream. You might die without seeing it. Men (to Si and Shorty) take him down that road about a mile, where you will find a considerable body of water which I\u0027m given to understand is called Goober Creek. You\u0027ll show it to him in all its magnificence and beauty. Geography is a very interesting study, old man, and it is not too late for you to begin getting acquainted with your own country.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The bitter humor of taking a man through the mud and pouring rain to see a creek that he had seen nearly every day of his life for a half-century was such that all the men were in a mood to appreciate. Si and Shorty entered into the affair with zest. They put a blanket on the old man\u0027s shoulders, to shelter him from the rain. Such a thing as an umbrella had never been in his house. Even the women would have looked upon it as a piece of luxurious effeminacy. \\n\\n \\n\\n The old fellow grumbled, expostulated, and protested, but if Si and Shorty had had no other motive, orders direct from the Brigadier-General would have been executed at any cost. It was the first time that they had ever received orders from anybody higher than the Colonel, and the effect upon them was extraordinary. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What in the everlastin\u0027 kingdom,\" grumbled he, \"kin your niggah-lovin\u0027 Yankees expect t\u0027 gain by draggin\u0027 me out when hit\u0027s a-rainin\u0027 cats and dogs?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 about it,\" answered Si, catching him by the shoulder to hurry him up. \"\u0027Tain\u0027t our business to know. We ain\u0027t paid for knowin\u0027 anything more than orders, and hardly enough for that. A man can\u0027t know much for $13 a month.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Twon\u0027t help yer niggeh-stealin\u0027 army a mite t\u0027 pi\u0027nt out Goober Crick t\u0027 me. I ain\u0027t gwine t\u0027 tote ye over nor show ye the fords.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t care nothin\u0027 about that neither,\" replied Shorty, as they pushed the old man along through the blinding \u0027rain. \"Our orders is merely to show you Goober Crick. \u0027Tain\u0027t none o\u0027 our business what the General wants you to see it for. Mebbe he thinks it \u0027ll improve your mind to gaze on the beauties o\u0027 nature. Mebbe he thinks you need exercise. Mebbe he thinks a shower-bath\u0027d do you good.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The column had been checked by some difficulty in front, and as the boys conveyed their charge through the ranks of waiting men it seemed that everybody understood what they were doing, and volleys of sarcasm were flung at their prisoner. There were inquiries as to how he liked the study of geography as far as he had gotten; whether he would continue it in more favorable weather, and whether this primary lesson would be followed by others on the road to the mill, the path to the stable, and the way to the spring. If the old man had not already been as angry as he could be, his temper would have risen. \\n\\n \\n\\n After a lot of toilsome plodding through the rain and mud which the passing wagons had made fathomless, they came to the top of a high hill, from which they could look down on a turbid sweep of yellow water, about half a mile away, which filled nearly the whole valley. \\n\\n \\n\\n The reason of delay was at once apparent. The insignificant stream had suddenly become an almost impassable obstacle. Men were riding carefully across the submerged bottom land, prodding with poles, to pick out crossings. Others were digging down approaches to what seemed promising crossings, and making rude bridges across gullies and smaller streams that intervened. \\n\\n \\n\\n It seemed that the fresh young Aid with whom the boys had the encounter the day before had in some mysterious way gained charge of the advance. He had graduated into the Engineer Corps from West Point, and here was an opportunity to display his immense knowledge to the glory of himself and the Engineers and the astonishment of those inferior persons who were merely officers of cavalry, infantry and artillery. Now he would show off the shrewd expedients and devices which have embellished the history of military engineering since the days of Hannibal and Julius Cesar. \\n\\n \\n\\n That everybody might know who was doing all this, the Aid was riding back and forward, loudly commanding parties engaged in various efforts over more than a quarter of a mile of front. He had brought up the pontoon-train, and the pontoniers were having a hard time trying to advance the boats into the rushing waters. It was all that the men could do to hold them against the swift current. If a pole slipped or went down in a deep hole the men holding it would slip and probably fall overboard, the boat would whirl around and drift far out of its place, requiring great labor to bring it back again, and bringing down a torrent of curses from the young Lieutenant on the clumsiness of \"the Stoughton bottles\" who were pretending to be soldiers and pontoniers. He was feeling that every word of this kind showed off his superior knowledge to those around. Some of the men were standing waist-deep in the water, trying to fasten lines to trees, to hold in place the boats already stationed and being held there by arms straining at the poles. Everywhere those engaged in the work were tumbling down in the water or being carried off their feet by the current and rescued again with difficulty, to be hauled out on the bank, exhausted, soaked to the skin and covered with slimy mud. \\n\\n \\n\\n For awhile this had seemed funny to the troops waiting to cross, and they had yelled and laughed themselves hoarse at the mishaps of their comrades. Now the fun had all evaporated and everybody was morose, with a strong tendency to outbreaks of profanity. \\n\\n \\n\\n The old man surveyed the scene with evident satisfaction. \"Yo\u0027 Yankees will git over thar about the middle o\u0027 July,\" he chuckled. \"Now, I reckon that\u0027s Goober Crick, an\u0027 as I have done seed hit you\u0027ll let me go back home, I s\u0027pose, won\u0027t ye?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s probably Goober Crick, or at least Goober Crick is somewhere under that muddy freshet,\" acquiesced Shorty. \"But I\u0027m not at all sure that it\u0027s the crick. Looks more like a misplaced chunk out o\u0027 the Mizzoori River. I\u0027m not sure, either, that your eyes kin see that distance. We\u0027ll have to walk you till we find a section of the crick somewhere that kin be recognized by the naked eyes. Come along, and step lively.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The old man groaned, but there was no hope for him from these relentless executants of orders. For a half hour more they plodded on. The mud grew deeper at every step, but the boys mercilessly forced the old man through the worst of it, that they might reach some point where they could actually see Goober Crick. He could not palm off on them any common old mud freshet for a creek that had a regular place on the map. \\n\\n \\n\\n Finally they came near the pontoons, and saw one almost capsize, throwing everybody in it into the water, while another whirled madly away toward the center of the current, with but one man in, who was frantically trying to stop it and save himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, he\u0027ll stop it, much,\" said Shorty, looking after him. \"If he gits ashore before he reaches the Mississippi I\u0027ll be surprised. Say, Si, it\u0027ll be easier lookin\u0027 for Goober Crick in a boat than wading through the mud. Let\u0027s git in one o\u0027 them boats.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This terrified the old man till he was ready to yield. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I begin t\u0027 know the place,\" he admitted. \"If we take this path through the woods t\u0027 the left hit\u0027ll bring us out whar yo\u0027 kin see Goober Crick for sartin, an\u0027 no mistake. Hit\u0027s allers above high-water thar.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys followed. A very short walk through a curtain of deep woods brought them on to much higher ground, where Goober Creek roared through a narrow channel it had cut in the rocks. As they stood on the banks, Si and Shorty\u0027s eyes met in a quick comprehension of the advantages of the place. They looked backward through the woods to see a depression in the hills, which promised a short and comparatively easy cut-off to the road in the rear, where the 200th Ind. lay. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, this is Goober Crick,\" said the old man, with an air of recalling an old acquaintance. \"I\u0027m sure of hit. Now, you\u0027ll let me go home, won\u0027t yer? I hain\u0027t got a dry thread left on me, an\u0027 I know I\u0027ll jest fairly die o\u0027 rheumatiz.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, you can go,\" said Shorty, who was filling his eyes with the lay of the ground, and the chances it offered of getting the 200th Ind. across ahead of the others and gaining the coveted head of the column. \"I\u0027ve no doubt you\u0027re awful wet, but mebbe you know more\u0027n you did a couple of hours ago. Skip!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The old man moved off with alacrity scarcely to be expected of him, and the boys saw that it was wisest to follow him, for he was taking a bee-line through the woods and brush for his home, and that they knew was near where they had left their regiment. \\n\\n \\n\\n Soon Co. Q, crouching under the cedars and ponchos spread over fence corners, hovering around struggling fires, and sullenly making the best of a very poor prospect, was electrified by Si and Shorty appearing on as near a run as they could put up with their weight-soaked garments. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Capt. McGillicuddy,\" gasped Si, \"we\u0027ve found a bully place to cross. Tell the Colonel quick. Let the boys git all the axes and shovels they kin, and come with us. We\u0027ll have a crossin\u0027 ready by the time the Colonel comes up with the regiment, and we kin git the advance agin.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si had gained that enviable position in the regiment where he could always have plenty of followers to anything that he proposed. The sullen despondency passed into active alertness as soon as he began speaking, and before he was done some of them were rummaging around the wagons for axes and shovels. Two or three of these implements were found in the old man\u0027s yard. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go ahead,\" said the Captain. \"I\u0027ll speak to the Colonel, and we\u0027ll follow you with the regiment. You can get the teams across, too?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certain,\" said Si, as he handed his gun, cartridge-box, haversack, blanket-roll and overcoat to another boy to carry for him, shouldered his ax and started off at a run, the others following. \\n\\n \\n\\n They came back to the spot whither the old man had led them. Si\u0027s experienced eye quickly selected two tall hickories, which could be felled directly across the stream and form the stringers for his bridge. The next instant the damp air was ringing with the strokes of eight as skillful axmen as there were in the army, Si leading on one tree and Shorty on the other. They could not keep up the feverish pace they had set for many minutes, but the instant their blows relaxed eight other men snatched the axes, and in a few minutes the trees toppled and fell just in the right position. Co. Q was now coming up, followed by the rest of the regiment, and they gave a cheer to echo the crash of the falling trees. Instantly hundreds of men and officers were at work clearing a road and completing the bridge. Some cut down other trees to furnish filling for the approaches, or to split into flooring for the bridge. Some dug down the bank and carried the clay to cover the brush and chunks. In an incredibly short time a bridge was completed, over which the regiment was marched, and the wagons pulled by the men, after the mules had been detached and walked over. \\n\\n \\n\\n Every fresh success was announced by tremendous cheering, which carried information to the rest of the brigade that the 200th Ind. was doing something unusual. News as to what this was at last reached the ears of the Lieutenant of Engineers, who was continuing his struggle with the pontoons with a persistence worthy of better luck. \\n\\n \\n\\n He rode up just in time to see Capt. McGillicuddy looking with elation at the passage of the last wagon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why was I not informed as to what you were doing here, sir?\" he asked angrily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Probably because we were too busy doing it to be talking about it. If you had known of it you would probably have tried to apply the 47th problem of Euclid to the case, and we wouldn\u0027t \u0027ve got ten over for a week. Eventually, sir, I expect you will find out that there are several things in the world that are not learned at West Point. Having accomplished all that we want with the bridge, I now have the pleasure of turning it over to the Engineer Department, and I wish that you may find it very useful,\" continued the Captain, as with a mocking smile and salute he followed the last of the regiment across the creek. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Adjutant,\" said Si, saluting that official with great respect, \"we\u0027ve now got the advance agin, hain\u0027t we?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re right we have, you bully boy with a glass eye,\" said the Adjutant, slapping him on the shoulder with a familiarity that would have given the young Engineer Lieutenant a spasm and caused a strong report on the discipline of the 200th Ind. \"And you can just bet we\u0027ll keep it, too. You ought to see the Colonel\u0027s eye. We\u0027ll lead the procession into Shelbyville, which is only 15 miles away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63256.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
