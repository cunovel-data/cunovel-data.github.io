THE YOUNG RECRUITS","content":"ARE GIVEN AN INITIATION INTO ARMY LIFE. \n \n BY the time Shorty had gotten the boys fairly tented, he was ordered to take a squad and guard some stores at the Division Quartermaster\u0027s. Si, instead of going on camp-guard, had to go out to the grand guard. When he came back the next morning the Orderly-Sergeant said to him: \n \n \"See here, Si, you\u0027ve got to take that squad of kids you brung into your particular charge, and lick \u0027em into shape. They need an awful sight of it, and I hain\u0027t got any time to give \u0027em. I\u0027ve something else to do besides teaching an infant class. I never was good at bringing children up by hand, anyway. I ain\u0027t built that way. I want you to go for them young roosters at once, and get \u0027em into shape in short meter. Marching orders may come any day, and then we want everybody up and dressed. There\u0027ll be no time for foolishness. Those dratted little rats were all over camp last night, and into more kinds of devilment than so many pet crows. I\u0027ve been hearing about nothing else this morning.\" \n \n \"Why,\" said Si, \"I supposed that they was too tired to do anything but lay down and go to sleep. What\u0027d they do?\" \n \n \"Better ask what they didn\u0027t do,\" replied the Orderly. \"They done everything that a passel o\u0027 impish school boys could think of, and what they couldn\u0027t think of them smart Alecks down in the company put \u0027em up to. I\u0027m going to put some o\u0027 them smarties through a course o\u0027 sprouts. I like to see boys in good spirits, and I can enjoy a joke with the next man, but there\u0027s such a thing as being too funny. I think a few hours o\u0027 extry fatigue duty will reduce their fever for fun.\" \n \n \"Why, what\u0027d they do?\" repeated Si. \n \n \"Well, in the first place, they got that Joslyn and Mackall to mark a big number 79 on their tents, and then put the same, with their names, on a sheet of paper, and take it up to the Captain\u0027s tent. \n \n \"The Captain was having a life-and-death rassle with Cap Summerville over their eternal chess, when he\u0027s crosser\u0027n two sticks, and liable to snap your head off if you interrupt him. \u0027Hello, what do you want? What\u0027s this?\u0027 says he, taking the paper.\" \n \n Them\u0027s Our Names and Addresses 59 \n \n \"\u0027Them\u0027s our names and addresses,\u0027 says the brats, cool as cucumbers. Thought we ought to give \u0027em to you, so\u0027s you\u0027d know where to find us, in case you wanted us in a hurry, say, at night.\u0027 \n \n \"The blazes it is,\u0027 says Cap, and Cap Summerville roared. \u0027You get back to your quarters quick as you can run. Don\u0027t worry about my not finding you when I want you. It\u0027s my business to find you, and I\u0027ve got men to help me do it. I\u0027ll find you sometime in a way that\u0027ll make your hair stand up. Get out, now, and never come around my tent with any such blamed nonsense as that.\u0027 \n \n \"And Cap Somerville took advantage of the break to snap up Cap\u0027s queen, which made him hotter\u0027n ever. \n \n \"When the boys got back they found them smart Alecks, Bob Walsh and Andy Sweeney, waiting for \u0027em, and they consoled \u0027em, saying, That\u0027s just the way with that old bull-head. Never\u0027ll take no good advice from nobody about running\u0027 the company. Thinks he knows it all. You see how he runs the company. He haint got the addresses o\u0027 half his men this minnit, and don\u0027t know where they are. That\u0027s the reason so many o\u0027 our letters from home, and the good things they send us, never reach us. He ought to keep a regler directory, same as in the other companies.\u0027\" \n \n \"Then some o\u0027 them smarties found out that Scruggs was stuck on his spouting. Seems that he was the star declaimer in his school. They laid it in to him that I was soft on hearing poetry spouted, especially after night, when the moon was up, and everything quiet in camp, and that I was particularly tender on \u0027Bingen on the Rhine.\u0027 You know that if there is anything I\u0027m dead sore on it\u0027s that sniveling rot. There used to be a pasty-faced boy in school that\u0027d wail that out, and set all the girls to bawling. Then they gave us an entertainment just before we left, and all the girls were there, and Pasty-Face he must be the star attraction. He wailed out his condemned old There-was-a-soldier-of-the Legion—laying-i-n-Algiers, and all the girls looked at us as if we were already dead, and they\u0027d better look out for new beaux. My own particular geranium did not lose any time, but married another feller before we got to Stone River. That made me hate the blasted caterwaul worse\u0027n ever. Then that white-eyed, moon-struck Alfonso used to be yowling it at every chance, until he went to the hospital, and he got all the rest so that they were sputtering rags and tags of it. But I\u0027ve been sorer than a bile on the condemned sick calfishness ever since I brung my chum Jim Bridgewater off the field at Chickamauga, and watched him die as the moon rose, back there at McFarland Gap. Well, what do these smarties do but fill up Scruggs with the idea that the best way to make himself forever solid with me was to stroll down close to my tent and casually let off \u0027Bingen on the Rhine\u0027 in his best style. I\u0027d just got down to work on them pesky pay-rolls, having kept Monaghan two days in the guard-house, so\u0027s to be sure that he\u0027d be sober enough to help me—and you know Monaghan\u0027s lightning with the pen when he\u0027s sober—when that possessed sap-sucker Scruggs began blatting out \u0027Bingen on the Rhine\u0027 till you could hear him down to the Colonel\u0027s quarters. It made me so mad that I knocked over the ink as I jumped up, and spoiled the triplicate rolls that we\u0027d got about half made out. I snatched up a club to simply mash the bawling brat, but they got him away before I could reach \u0027im. They explained to Scruggs afterward that I was subject to fits whenever the moon was in her last quarter, and they\u0027d forgotten to look at the almanac that evening. O, but I\u0027ll soak \u0027em for that yet.\" \n \n \"Trouble is,\" said Si, laughing, \"the boys\u0027ve bin layin\u0027 around doin\u0027 nothin\u0027 too long. They\u0027re fuller o\u0027 devilment than a dog is of fleas.\" \n \n \"But I haint told you half,\" continued the Orderly-Sergeant. \"Them smarties were quick to find out that Alf Russell and Jim Humphreys leaned strongly toward religion, and they filled \u0027em with the idea that Cap McGillicuddy was a very devout man, and held family devotions every evening in his tent, in which his company joined.\" \n \n \"Great goodness,\" gasped Si. \"They never heard Cap\u0027s remarks when we balked on a right wheel in company column.\" \n \n \"Well,\" continued the Orderly, \"Cap had been waxed by Cap Summerville two games hand-running, and they were nip-and-tuck on the third, and just as impatient and cross as they always are when they\u0027re neck-and-neck in the last heat. The tent-flap raised, and in walked Russell and Humphreys soft and quietlike, as if they were going into the sitting-room for evening prayers. They had their caps in their hands, and didn\u0027t say anything but brushed their hair back and took their seats in the first place they could find, which happened to be Cap\u0027s cot. Cap didn\u0027t notice \u0027em till after Cap Summerville had caught his queen and then checkmated him in two moves. You know how redhot Cap gets when he loses a game of chess, particularly to Cap Summerville, who rubs it in on him without mercy. \n \n \"Cap looked at the boys in astonishment, and then snapped out: \u0027Well, what do you boys want?\u0027 \u0027We\u0027ve just come in for evening prayers,\u0027 says they, mild as skimmed milk. \u0027Evening what?\u0027 roared the Cap. \u0027Evening prayers,\u0027 says they. \u0027Don\u0027t you have family devotion every evening? Cap Summerville couldn\u0027t hold in any longer, and just roared, and the fellers outside, who\u0027d had their ears against the canvas listening to every word, they roared too. Cap was madder\u0027n a July hornet, and cussed till the ridgepole shook. Then he took the two boys by the ears and marched \u0027em out and says: \u0027You two brats go back to your tents and stay there. When I want you to come to my tent I\u0027ll send for you, and you\u0027ll wish I hadn\u0027t. You\u0027ll do praying enough if you\u0027re on hand when the church call\u0027s sounded. You\u0027ll be mightily different from the rest of my company if you don\u0027t prefer going on guard to church. Get, now!\u0027\" \n \n \"Now the Captain oughtn\u0027t to say that about the company,\" protested Si. \"I for one go to church every chance I get.\" \n \n \"O, yes, you do,\" sneered the Orderly-Sergeant. \"Who was it, I\u0027d like to know, that sent word back to the boys in the rear to steal the Chaplain\u0027s horse, and keep him hid for a day or two so\u0027s he couldn\u0027t get up and hold services, because you boys wanted to go fishing in the Tennessee River?\" \n \n \"Yes, I did,\" Si confessed; \"but it was because the boys begged me to. We\u0027d just got there, and it looked as if the biting was good, and we probably wouldn\u0027t stay there longer\u0027n over Sunday.\" \n \n \"Well, I ain\u0027t done yet,\" continued the Orderly-Sergeant. \"That little snipe, Pete Skidmore—\" \n \n \"Good gracious, he wasn\u0027t lost again, was he?\" gasped Si. \n \n \"That\u0027s just what he was, the little runt, and we had the devil\u0027s own time finding him. What in Sam Hill did the Captain take him for, I\u0027d like to know? Co. Q aint no nursery. Well, the bugler up at Brigade Headquarters blowed some sort of a call, and Skidmore wanted to know what it meant. They told him that it was an order for the youngest man in each company to come up there and get some milk for his coffee tomorrow morning, and butter for his bread. There was only enough issued for the youngest boys, and if he wanted his share he\u0027d have to get a big hustle on him, for the feller whose nose he\u0027d put out o\u0027 joint \u0027d try hard to get there ahead o\u0027 him, and get his share. So Skidmore went off at a dead run toward the sound of the bugle, with the boys looking after him and snickering. But he didn\u0027t come back at roll-call, nor at tattoo, and the smart Alecks begun to get scared, and abuse each other for setting up a job on a poor, innocent little boy. Osc Brewster and Ol Perry, who had been foremost in the trick had a fight as to which had been to blame. Taps come, and he didn\u0027t get back, and then we all became scared. I\u0027d sent Jim Hunter over to Brigade Headquarters to look for him, but he came back, and said they hadn\u0027t seen anything of him there. Then I turned out the whole company to look for him. Of course, them too-awfully smart galoots of Co. A had to get very funny over our trouble. They asked why we didn\u0027t get the right kind of nurses for our company, that wouldn\u0027t let the members stray out of their sight? Why we didn\u0027t call the children in when the chickens went to roost, undress \u0027em, and tuck \u0027em in their little beds, and sing to \u0027em after they\u0027d said \u0027Now I lay me down to sleep?\u0027 I stood it all until that big, hulking Pete Nasmith came down with a camp-kettle, which he was making ring like a bell, as he yelled out, \u0027Child lost! Child lost!\u0027 Behind him was Tub Rawlings singing, \u0027Empty\u0027s the cradle, baby\u0027s gone.\u0027 Then I pulled off my blouse and slung it into my tent, and told \u0027em there went my chevrons, and I was simply Scott Ralston, and able to lick any man in Co. A. One o\u0027 their Lieutenants came out and ordered them back to their quarters, and I deployed the company in a skirmish-line, and started \u0027em through the brush toward Brigade Headquarters. About three-quarters o\u0027 the way Osc Brewster and Ol Perry, when going through a thicket, heard a boy boo-hooing. They made their way to him, and there was little Skidmore sitting on a stump, completely confused and fagged out. He\u0027d lost his way, and the more he tried to find it the worse he got turned around. They called out to him, and he blubbered out: \u0027Yes, it\u0027s me; little Pete Skidmore. Them doddurned fools in my company \u0027ve lost me, just as I\u0027ve bin tellin\u0027 \u0027em right along they would, durn \u0027em.\u0027 Osc and Ol were so tickled at finding him that they gathered him up, and come whooping back to camp, carrying him every step of the way.\" \n \n \"Well, I declare to gracious,\" ejaculated Si. \"But there\u0027s one left yet. Didn\u0027t anything happen to Sandy Baker?\" \n \n \"O, yes,\" groaned the Orderly. \"He had to be in it, too. He took advantage of the tumult to fall into the company well. We didn\u0027t know anything about it till we come back from hunting Skidmore. By that time he was so chilled that he could hardly holler any more, and his teeth chattered like a nigger minstrel\u0027s bones. I\u0027d got a can of brandied peaches down at the sutler\u0027s, and it took all the brandy to bring him around, and I had nothing left but the peaches. Now, while I like a little variety in camp-life as well as the next man, I don\u0027t want no more ructions like last night\u0027s. I\u0027ll put you in charge of those kids, and hold you responsible for \u0027em. I don\u0027t care what you do with \u0027em, so long\u0027s you keep \u0027em quiet, and don\u0027t disturb the company. Kill \u0027em, if you want to, but keep \u0027em quiet. I\u0027ve got to finish up them pay-rolls tonight.\" \n \n \"You bet me and Shorty\u0027ll stop these smart Alecks from imposin\u0027 on the poor little greenies,\" asserted Si. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63301.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
