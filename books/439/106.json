THE FIRST SCRAPE","content":"A LITTLE INITIATORY SKIRMISH WITH THE GUERRILLAS. \n \n THE train passed Shelbyville in the course of the afternoon and halted on a switch. Tired of reading, Si was standing at the door of the car, looking out over the country and trying to identify places they had passed or camped at during the campaign of the previous Summer. Suddenly his far-seeing eyes became fixed on the intervals in the trees on the farthest hill-top. Without turning his head he called Shorty in a tone which made that worthy lose all interest in his inevitable pack of cards and spring to his side. Without speaking, Si pointed to the sky-line of the eminence, against which moving figures sketched themselves. \n \n \"Guerrillas,\" said Shorty. \n \n Si nodded affirmatively. \n \n \"Skeetin\u0027 acrost the country to jump this train or some other,\" continued Shorty. \n \n \"This one, most likely,\" answered Si. \n \n \"Yes,\" accorded Shorty, with an estimating glance at the direction of the range of hills, \"and\u0027ll aim at strikin\u0027 us at some bridge or deep cut about 10 miles from here.\" \n \n \"Where we\u0027ll probably git sometime after dark,\" assented Si. \n \n \"Yes. Let\u0027s talk to the conductor and engineer.\" \n \n The train had started in the meanwhile, but presently the conductor came back into the caboose. He had been a soldier, but so severely wounded as to necessitate his discharge as incapable of further field service. \n \n \"I hardly think there\u0027s any danger,\" said Conductor Madden. \"Things \u0027ve been very quiet this side of the Tennessee River ever since last October, when Crook, Wilder and Minty belted the life out of old Joe Wheeler down there at Farmington and Rodgersville. Our cavalry gave theirs an awful mauling, and them that were lucky enough to escape acrost the river have seemed purty well satisfied to stay on that side. A hell\u0027s mint of \u0027em were drowned trying to get acrost the river. Our cavalry\u0027s been patrolling the country ever since, but hasn\u0027t seen anything of consequence. Still, it is possible that some gang has managed to sneak acrost a blind-ford somewhere, and in hopes to catch a train. Guerrillas are always where you find \u0027em.\" \n \n \"Well, I\u0027ll bet a hatful o\u0027 red apples,\" said Si, \"that them was guerrillas that we saw, and they\u0027re makin\u0027 for this train. The rebels in Nashville somehow got information to \u0027em about it.\" \n \n \"Them\u0027s guerrillas,\" affirmed Shorty, \"sure\u0027s the right bower takes the left. None o\u0027 our cavalry\u0027s stringin\u0027 around over the hill-tops. Then, I made out some white horses, which our cavalry don\u0027t have. It\u0027s just as Si says, them Nashville spies \u0027s put the rebel cavalry onto us.\" \n \n \"Them cowardly, sneaking, death-deserving rebels in Nashville,\" broke out Conductor Madden, with a torrent of oaths. \"Every man in Nashville that wears citizen\u0027s clothes ought to be hung on sight, and half the women. They don\u0027t do nothing but lay around and take the oath of allegiance, watch every move we make like a cat does a mouse, and send information through the lines. You can\u0027t draw a ration of hardtack but they know it, and they\u0027re looking down your throat while you\u0027re eating it. They haint got the gravel in their craws to go out and fight themselves, and yet they\u0027ve cost us a hundred times as many lives as if they had. Why does the General allow them to stay there? He ought to order rocks tied to the necks of every blasted one of \u0027em and fling \u0027em into the Cumberland River and then pour turpentine on the infernal old town and touch a match to it. That\u0027s what I\u0027d do if I had my way. There\u0027s more, brimstone trouble to the acre in Nashville than in any town on the footstool, not barring even Richmond.\" \n \n \"Nashville certainly is tough,\" sighed Shorty. \"\u0027Specially in gamblers. Worst tin-horn crowd that ever fumbled a deck or skinned a greeny out o\u0027 the last cent o\u0027 his bounty. Say, Si, do you remember that tin-horny that I cleaned out o\u0027 his whole pile down there at Murfreesboro, with them cards that I\u0027d clipped with a pair o\u0027 scissors, so\u0027s I\u0027d know \u0027em by the feel, and he never ketched on till his last shinplaster was gone, and then I throwed the pack in the fire? Well, I seen him down there at the depot smellin\u0027 around for suckers. I told him to let our boys alone or I\u0027d snap his neck off short. Great Jehosephat, but I wanted a chance to git up town and give some o\u0027 them cold-deckers a whirl.\" \n \n \"Well,\" said Conductor Madden, after some deliberation, \"I believe what you boys say. You\u0027re not the kind to get rattled and make rebels out of cedar-bushes. All the same, there\u0027s nothing to do but go ahead. My orders were to take this train through to Chattanooga as quick as I could. I can\u0027t stop on a suspicion.\" \n \n \"No, indeed,\" assented Si and Shorty. \n \n \"There\u0027s no place to telegraph from till we get to Bridgeport, on the Tennessee, and if we could telegraph they wouldn\u0027t pay any attention to mere reports of having seen rebels at a distance. They want something more substantial than that.\" \n \n \"Of course they do, and very properly,\" said Si. \"Is your engineer all right?\" \n \n \"Game as they make \u0027em, and loyal as Abraham Lincoln himself,\" responded the conductor. \n \n \"Well, I believe our boys \u0027s all right. They\u0027re green, and they\u0027re friskier than colts in a clover field, but they\u0027re all good stuff, and I believe we kin stand off any ordinary gang o\u0027 guerrillas. I\u0027ll chance it, anyhow. This\u0027s a mighty valuable train to risk, but it ought to go through, for we don\u0027t know how badly they may need it. You tell your engineer to go ahead carefully and give two long whistles if he sees anything dangerous.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll go and git onto the engine with him,\" said Shorty. \n \n \"Wait a little,\" said Si. \"We\u0027ll get the boys together, issue \u0027em catridges and give \u0027em a little preparation for a light, if we\u0027re to have one.\" \n \n The sun had gone down and the night was at hand. The train had stopped to take on a supply of wood from a pile by the roadside. Some of the boys were helping pitch the heavy sticks onto the engine, the rest ware skylarking along the tops of the cars in the irrepressible exuberance of animal spirits of boys who had had plenty to eat and were without a care in the world. Harry Joslyn had been giving exhibitions of standing on his head on the runningboard. Gid Mackall had converted a piece of rope he had picked up into a lasso, and was trying to imitate the feats he had seen performed at the last circus. Monty Scruggs, the incipient lawyer, who was proud of his elocutionary talents, had vociferated at the woods they were passing, \"Rienzi\u0027s Address to the Romans,\" \"The Last Sigh of the Moor,\" \"Absalom,\" \"The Battle of Waterloo,\" and similar staples of Friday afternoon recitations. Alf Russell, the embryonic doctor, who sang a fine tenor, was rendering \"Lily Dale\" with much impressment, and little Pete Skidmore was \"skipping\" the flat hill-stones over an adjacent pond. \n \n \"\u0027Tention!\" shouted Si. \n \n There was something so different in the tone from that in which Si had before spoken, that it arrested the attention of every one of them instantly. \n \n \"Git your guns and fall in two ranks on that sod, there, at once,\" commanded Si, in quick, curt accents. \n \n An impalpable something in the tones and words stilled everybody into seriousness. This was deepened by the look they saw on Si\u0027s face. \n \n They snatched up their guns and hurried into line on the spot indicated, looking into each other\u0027s countenances and into that of Si\u0027s for an explanation of what was up. \n \n \"Mackall and Joslyn,\" called Shorty from the car, \"come here and take this box of catridges.\" \n \n \"Now,\" said Si, as they did this, \"Joslyn, you and Mackall issue those to the boys. One of you walk down in front and the other behind and give each man two packages of catridges. You boys open the packages and put the catridges in your catridgeboxes, bullet-end up, and the caps in your capboxes.\" \n \n The boys followed his directions with nervous eagerness, inspired by his words and manner, and then fixed their anxious gaze upon him for further impartment. \n \n Si walked down in front, in the rear of the line, superintending the operation. \n \n \"Now, boys,\" said Si, taking his place in front and facing them, \"you\u0027ve bin talkin\u0027 about guerrillas ever since we crossed the Ohio, but now there\u0027s a prospect o\u0027 meetin\u0027 some. I hadn\u0027t expected to see any till after we\u0027d reached Chattanoogy, but guerrillas\u0027s never where you expect \u0027em.\" \n \n \"Knowin\u0027 you was so anxious to see \u0027em, they\u0027ve come up the road to meet you,\" interjected Shorty. \n \n \"It looks,\" continued Si, \"as if they\u0027d got news of the train and slipped out here to take it away from us. They may attack it at any minute after we start agin. Now, we mustn\u0027t let \u0027em git it. It\u0027s too valuable to the Government to lose and too valuable to them to git. We mustn\u0027t let \u0027em have it, I tell you. Now, I want you to load your guns carefully, handle \u0027em very carefully after they are loaded, git back in the cars, stop skylarkin\u0027, keep very quiet, listen for orders, and when you git \u0027em, obey \u0027em to the letterâ€”no more, no less.\" \n \n Watching the Bridge Burners at Work 259 \n \n \"Can\u0027t we go back on top o\u0027 the cars, where we kin watch for \u0027em, and git the first pop at \u0027em?\" said Harry Joslyn, in a pleading tone. \n \n \"No; that\u0027s too dangerous, and you\u0027ll lose time in gittin\u0027 together,\" answered Si. \"You must all come into the cars with me.\" \n \n \"Sergeant,\" said Shorty, \"let me have a couple to go on the engine with me.\" \n \n \"Le\u0027 me go. Le\u0027 me go,\" they all seemed to shout at once, holding up their hands in eager school-boy fashion. \n \n \"I can\u0027t take but two o\u0027 you,\" said Shorty; \"more\u0027d be in the way.\" \n \n They all pressed forward. \"Count out. That\u0027s the only fair way,\" shouted the boys in the center. \n \n \"That\u0027s so,\" said Harry Joslyn. \"Stand still till I count. Imry, Ory, Ickery, Ann, Quevy, Quavy, Irish Navy, Filleson, Folleson, Nicholasâ€”Buck! That\u0027s me. I\u0027m it!\" \n \n He rapidly repeated the magic formula, and pronounced Gid Mackall \"it.\" \n \n \"He didn\u0027t count fair! He didn\u0027t count fair! He never counts fair,\" protested the others; but Si hustled them into the cars and the train started. \n \n It had grown quite dark. The boys sat silent and anxiously expectant on their seats, clutching their loaded guns, held stiffly upright, and watching Si\u0027s face as well as they could by the dim light of the single oil lamp. Si leaned against the side of the door and watched intently. \n \n Only little Pete Skidmore was unrepressed by the gravity of the situation. Rather, it seemed to spur his feet, his hands and his mouth to nimbler activity. He was everywhereâ€”at one moment by Si\u0027s side in the door of the car, at the next climbing up to peer out of the window; and then clambering to the top of the car, seeing legions of guerrillas in the bushes, until sternly ordered back by Si. Then he would drop the butt of his musket on the floor with a crash which would start every one of the taut nerves to throbbing. And the questions that he asked: \n \n \"Say, Sergeant, will the guerrillas holler before they shoot, or shoot before they holler?\" \n \n \"Sometimes one and sometimes the other,\" responded Si, absently. \"Keep quiet, Pete.\" \n \n Quiet for a minute, and then: \n \n \"Shall we holler before we shoot or shoot before we holler?\" \n \n \"Neither. Keep perfectly quiet, and \u0027tend strictly to your little business.\" \n \n \"I think we ought to holler some. Makes it livelier. What sort o\u0027 guns has the guerrillas?\" \n \n \"Every kindâ€”shot-guns, pistols, rifles, flint-locks, cap-locksâ€”every kind. Now, you mustn\u0027t ask me any more questions. Don\u0027t bother me.\" \n \n \"Yes, sir; I won\u0027t.\" \n \n Quiet for at least five seconds. Then: \n \n \"Have the guerrillas guns that\u0027ll shoot through the sides of the cars?\" \n \n \"Probably.\" \n \n \"Then I\u0027d ruther be on top, where I kin see something. Kin they shoot through the sides o\u0027 the tender, and let all the water out and stop the engine?\" \n \n \"Guess not.\" \n \n \"Haven\u0027t they any real big guns that will?\" \n \n \"Mebbe.\" \n \n \"Kin we plug up the holes, anyway, then, and start agin?\" \n \n \"Probably.\" \n \n \"Hain\u0027t the engineer got an iron shield that he kin git behind, so they can\u0027t shoot him?\" \n \n \"Can\u0027t he turn the steam onto \u0027em, and scald \u0027em if they try to git at him?\" \n \n \"What\u0027ll happen if they shoot the head-light out?\" \n \n \"Why wouldn\u0027t it be a good idee to put a lot o\u0027 us on the cow-ketcher, with fixed bayonets, and then let the engineer crack on a full head o\u0027 steam and run us right into \u0027em?\" \n \n \"Great Scott, Pete, you must stop askin\u0027 questions,\" said Si desperately. \"Don\u0027t you see Pm busy?\" \n \n Pete was silent for another minute. Then he could hold in no longer: \n \n \"Sergeant, jest one question more, and then I\u0027ll keep quiet.\" \n \n \"Well, what is it?\" \n \n \"If the rebels shoot the bell, won\u0027t it make a noise that they kin hear clear back at Nashville?\" \n \n The engine suddenly stopped, and gave two long whistles. Above the screech they heard shots from Shorty and the two boys with him. \n \n \"Here they are, boys,\" said Si, springing out and running up the bank. \"All out, boys. Come up here and form.\" \n \n As he reached the top of the bank a yell and a volley came from the other side of the creek. Shorty joined him at once, bringing the two boys on the engine with him. \n \n \"We\u0027ve bin runnin\u0027 through this deep cut,\" he explained, \"and jest come out onto the approach to the bridge, when we see a little fire away ahead, and the head-light showed some men runnin\u0027 down on to the bank on the other side o\u0027 the crick. We see in a moment what was up. They\u0027ve jest got to the road and started a fire on the bridge that\u0027s about a mile ahead. Their game was to burn that bridge, and when this train stopped, burn this one behind us, ketch us, whip us, and take the train. We shot at the men we see on the bank, but probably didn\u0027t do \u0027em no harm. They\u0027re all pilin\u0027 down now to the other bank to whip us out and git the train. You\u0027d better deploy the boys along the top o\u0027 the bank here and open on \u0027em. We can\u0027t save that bridge, but we kin this and the train, by keepin\u0027 \u0027em on the other side o\u0027 the crick. I\u0027ll take charge o\u0027 the p\u0027int here with two or three boys, and drive off any o\u0027 them that tries to set fire to the bridge, and you kin look out for the rest o\u0027 the line. It\u0027s goin\u0027 to be longtaw work, for you see the crick\u0027s purty wide, but our guns \u0027ll carry further\u0027n theirs, and if we keep the boys well in hand I think we kin stand \u0027em off without much trouble.\" \n \n \"Sure,\" said Si confidently. \"You watch the other side o\u0027 the bridge and I\u0027ll look out for the rest.\" \n \n The eager boys had already begun firing, entering into the spirit of the thing with the zest of a Fame of town-ball. Shorty took Gid Mackall and Harry Joslyn down to the cover of some large stones, behind which they could lie and command the approach to the other end of the bridge with their rifles. Si took the other boys and placed them behind rocks and stumps along the crest and instructed them to fire with as good aim as possible at the flashes from the other side. In a minute or two he had a fine skirmish-line in operation, with the boys firing as deliberately and accurately as veterans. The engineer had backed the train under the cover of the cut, and presently he and the conductor came up with guns and joined the firing-line. \n \n \"I say, Shorty,\" said Si, coming down to where that worthy was stationed, \"what d\u0027 you think o\u0027 the boys now? They take to this like a duck to water. They think it\u0027s more fun than squirrel-huntin\u0027. Listen.\" \n \n They heard Monty Scruggs\u0027s baritone call: \n \n \"Say, Alf, did you see me salt that feller that\u0027s bin yellin\u0027 and cussin\u0027 at me over there? He\u0027s cussin\u0027 now for something else. I think I got him right where he lived.\" \n \n \"I wasn\u0027t paying any attention to you,\" Alf\u0027s fine tenor replied, as his rammer rang in his barrel. \"I\u0027ve got business o\u0027 my own to \u0027tend to. There\u0027s a feller over there that\u0027s firing buckshot at me that I\u0027ve got to settle, and here goes.\" \n \n \"The 200th Injianny Volunteers couldn\u0027t put up a purtier skirmish than this,\" murmured Si, in accents of pride, as he raised his gun and fired at a series of flashes on the farther bank. \n \n \"I say, tell that engineer to uncouple his engine and bring it back up here where the head-light\u0027ll cover the other side,\" said Shorty. \"It\u0027ll make the other side as light as day and we kin see every move, while we\u0027ll be in the dark.\" \n \n \"Good idee,\" said Si, hastening to find the engineer. \n \n He was none too soon. As the engine rolled up, flooding its advance with light, it brought a storm of bullets from the other side, but revealed three men creeping toward the other end of the bridge. Two were carrying pine knots, and the third, walking behind, had a stick of blazing pine, which he was trying to shield from observation with his hat. \n \n \"Take the front man, Harry. Take the second one, Gid. I\u0027ll take the man with the light,\" commanded Shorty. \n \n The three rifles cracked in quick succession and the three men dropped. \n \n \"Bully, boys,\" ejaculated Shorty, as he reloaded. \"You\u0027ll do. The 200th Injianny\u0027s proud o\u0027 you.\" \n \n \"I hit my man in the leg,\" said Harry, flushing with delight, as he bit off another cartridge. \"Jerusalem, I wish they\u0027d send another one down.\" \n \n \"I drawed on my man\u0027s bundle o\u0027 wood,\" said Gid, \"and then dropped a little, so\u0027s to git him where he was biggest and make sure o\u0027 him.\" \n \n \"Well, my man\u0027s beauty\u0027s spiled forever,\" said Shorty. \"The light flared up on his face and I let him have it there.\" \n \n \"But Linden saw another light. \n When beat the drums at dead of night, \n Commanding fires of death to hight \n The darkness of her scenery,\" \n \n recited Monty Scruggs. \"Gracious, I\u0027m hit!\" \n \n \"Where?\" asked Si, running up to him. \n \n \"Through my leg,\" answered Monty. \n \n \"Kin you walk?\" \n \n \"I guess so.\" \n \n \"Well, make your way back to the cars and git in and lay down.\" \n \n \"Not much,\" answered Monty determinedly. \"It don\u0027t hurt much, and I\u0027m going to stay and see this thing out. I can tie it up with my handkerchief.\" \n \n \"Scatter again, boys,\" Si warned several, who had rushed up; \"don\u0027t make too big a mark for the fellers on the other side. Go back and \u0027tend to your bizniss. I\u0027ll help him tie up his wound. I\u0027m afeared, though, that some o\u0027 the boys are runnin\u0027 out o\u0027 catridges, they have bin shootin\u0027 so rapidly. I want a couple o\u0027 you to run back to the cars and git another box.\" \n \n \"Let me and Sandy go,\" pleaded little Pete Skidmore. \"The big boys went before.\" \n \n \"All right; skip out. Break the lid o\u0027 the box off before you take it out o\u0027 the car. We haven\u0027t anything here to do it with. Leave your guns here.\" \n \n \"No, we\u0027ll take \u0027em along,\" pleaded Pete, with a boyish love for his rifle. \"We mightn\u0027t be able to find \u0027em agin.\" \n \n The firing from the opposite bank became fitful, died down, and then ceased altogether. Then a couple of shots rang out from far in the rear in the direction of the train. This seemed to rouse the rebels to another volley, and then all became quiet. The shots in the rear disturbed Si, who started back to see what they meant, but met Pete Skidmore and Sandy Baker coming panting up, carrying a box of cartridges between them. \n \n \"We got back as quick as we could,\" Pete explained as he got his breath. \"Just as we was coming to the train we see a rebel who was carrying a fat-pine torch, and making for the train to set it on fire. We shot him. Was that all right?\" \n \n \"Perfectly,\" said Si. \"Was there any more with him?\" \n \n \"No. We looked around for others, but couldn\u0027t find none. That\u0027s what kept up so long.\" \n \n \"The Johnnies have given it up and gone,\" said Shorty, coming up. \"I went over to a place where I could see \u0027em skippin\u0027 out by the light o\u0027 the burnin\u0027 o\u0027 the other bridge. We might as well put out guards here and go into camp till mornin\u0027.\" \n \n \"All right,\" assented Si. \"We\u0027ve saved the train and bridge, and that\u0027s all we kin do.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63293.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
