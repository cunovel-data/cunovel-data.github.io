{"id":45063,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER IV. THE SUNSHINE OF LIFE","content":"SI FEELS ONCE MORE THAT LIFE IS REALLY WORTH LIVING. THERE come times in every man\u0027s life when he feels himself part of the sunshine that illumines and warms the earth: The lover, after he has won his best girl\u0027s consent. The candidate, after he has been elected by a big majority. The valedictorian, after his address has been received with bursts of ringing applause. The clerk, after he has been admitted into partnership. The next morning the camp of the 200th Ind. seemed to Si Klegg one of the most delightful places on earth. The sun shone brightly and cheerily through the crisp December air. The fires of cedar rails sent up a pungent, grateful fragrance. Hardtack, pork and coffee tasted better than he had ever known them. Everybody noticed him and spoke pleasantly to him. The other boys of Co. Q called out cheerily to him from their fires. Those from other companies would stroll over to take a look at him and Shorty, and his comrades would point them out proudly as fair specimens of Co. Q, and what it was capable of doing when called upon in an emergency. The Adjutant Smiled on si and Shorty 48 The Captain spoke very cordially to him and Shorty, the busy Adjutant stopped and greeted them smilingly, and even the grave Colonel singled them out for a pleasant \"Good morning\" and an inquiry as to whether they had everything they wanted. It did not seem to Si that there was anything more on earth just then for which he could ask. The 200th Ind. having been at the head of the 49column when it halted, was to take the rear for that day\u0027s march, and so remained in camp for a while to let the rest pass on. After getting things ready for the march Si and Shorty took a stroll through the camp to see what was to be seen. They came across their prisoners seated around a fire, under guard. How different they looked from what they did the evening before, when the two partners encountered them in the depths of the cedar brake. Then they seemed like fierce giants, capable of terrible things, such as would make the heart quail. Now, powerless of harm, and awed by the presence of multitudes of armed men in blue filling the country in every direction that they looked, they appeared very commonplace, ignorant, rough men, long-haired, staring-eyed, and poorly-clad in coarse, butternut-dyed homespun, frayed and tattered. \"Father gits better men than them to work on the farm for $8 a month,\" Si remarked to Shorty, after a lengthened survey of them. \"Eight dollars a month is Congressman\u0027s wages to what they git for fightin\u0027 for the Southern Confederacy,\" answered Shorty. \"I don\u0027t s\u0027pose any one of \u0027em ever had eight real dollars in his pocket in his life. They say they\u0027re fightin\u0027 to keep us from takin\u0027 their niggers away from \u0027em, and yit if niggers wuz sellin\u0027 for $1 a-piece not one of \u0027em could buy a six-months\u0027-old baby. Let\u0027s go up and talk to \u0027em.\" \"I don\u0027t know \u0027bout that,\" said Si, doubtfully. \"Seems to me I wouldn\u0027t be particularly anxious to see men who\u0027d taken me prisoner and talked very cross about blowin\u0027 my blamed head off.\"50 \"O, that\u0027s all right,\" answered Shorty confidently. \"Words spoken in the heat of debate, and so on. They won\u0027t lay them up agin us. If they do, and want any satisfaction, we can give it to \u0027em. I kin lick any man in that crowd with my fists, and so kin you. We\u0027ll jest invite \u0027em to a little argyment with nature\u0027s weepons, without no interference by the guard. Come on.\" The Prisoners 50 The prisoners returned their greetings rather pleasantly. They were so dazed by the host of strange faces that Si and Shorty seemed, in a measure, like old acquaintances. \"Had plenty to eat, boys,\" asked Shorty, familiarly, seating himself on a log beside them and passing his pipe and tobacco to the Sergeant. \"Plenty, thankee,\" said the Sergeant, taking the pipe and filling it. \"More\u0027n we\u0027uns \u0027ve had sence we left home, an\u0027 mouty good vittles, too. You Yanks sartinly live well, ef yo\u0027uns don\u0027t do nothin\u0027 else.\" \"Yes,\" said Shorty, with a glance at his mud-stained garments, \"we\u0027re bound to live high and dress well, even if we don\u0027t lay up a cent.\" \"You sartinly do have good cloze, too,\" said the Sergeant, surveying the stout blue uniforms with admiration. \"Yo\u0027uns\u0027 common soldiers \u0027ve better cloze than our officers. We\u0027uns got hold o\u0027 some o\u0027 yo\u0027uns\u0027 overcoats, and they wear like leather.\" \"There\u0027s leather in \u0027em,\" said Shorty unblushingly. \"I tell you, old Abe Lincoln\u0027s a very smart man. He saw that this war was costin\u0027 a heap of money, especially for clothes. He got a bright idee that by soaking the clothes when they were new and green in the tan-vats, jest after the leather wuz taken out, they\u0027d take up the strength o\u0027 the leather out o\u0027 the juice, and wear always. The idee worked bully, and now old Abe goes every morning to where they\u0027re makin\u0027 clothes and sees that every stitch is put to soak.\" \"Nobody but a Yankee\u0027d thought o\u0027 that,\" said the rebel reflectively.52 \"You bet,\" assented Shorty. \"Jeff Davis\u0027d never think of it if he lived to be as old as Methuselah. But that\u0027s only the beginnin\u0027 of Abe Lincoln\u0027s smartness.\" \"He\u0027s a durned sight smarter man than we\u0027uns thought he wuz when we begun the war,\" admitted the Sergeant. \"But we\u0027uns \u0027ll wollop him yit, in spite of his smartness.\" \"We kin tell more about that a few months later,\" returned Shorty. \"It\u0027s never safe to count the game until the last hand\u0027s played. We hain\u0027t fairly begun to lead trumps yit. But what are you fellers fighting for, anyhow?\" \"We\u0027uns foutin\u0027 for our liberty, and t\u0027 keep yo\u0027uns from takin\u0027 our niggers away.\" The reply that came to Shorty\u0027s lips was that they seemed to be losing a great deal of liberty rather than gaining it, but he checked this by the fear that it would be construed as an ungentlemanly boast of their capture. He said, instead: \"I never knowed as any of us wanted your niggersâ€”me particularly. I wouldn\u0027t take a wagon load of \u0027em, even if the freight was prepaid. But, let me ask you, Sergeant, how many niggers do you own?\" \"I don\u0027t own nary one.\" \"Does your father own any?\" \"No, he don\u0027t.\" \"Does your mother, or brothers, uncles, aunts, or cousins own any?\" persisted Shorty. \"No, thar ain\u0027t nary one owned in the hull family.\" \"Seems to me,\" said Shorty, \"you\u0027re doin\u0027 a great deal of fightin\u0027 to keep us from takin\u0027 away from53 you something that we don\u0027t want and you hain\u0027t got. That\u0027s the way it looks to a man from north o\u0027 the Ohio River. Mebbe there\u0027s something in the Tennessee air that makes him see differently. I\u0027ll admit that I\u0027ve changed my mind about a good many things since we crossed the river.\" \"I\u0027ve alluz said,\" spoke another of the prisoners, \"that this wuz a rich man\u0027s wah and a pore man\u0027s fout.\" \"Well,\" said Shorty, philosophically, \"for folks that like that sort o\u0027 fightin,\u0027 that\u0027s the sort o\u0027 fightin\u0027 they like. I\u0027m different. I don\u0027t. When I fight it\u0027s for something that I\u0027ve got an interest in.\" While the discussion was going on Si had been studying the appearance of the prisoners. In spite of their being enemies his heart was touched by their comfortless condition. Not one of them had an overcoat or blanket. The Sergeant and a couple of others had over their shoulders pieces of the State House carpet, which had been cut up into lengths and sewed together for blankets. Another had what had once been a gaudy calico counterpane, with the pat tern \"Rose of Sharon\" wrought out in flaming colors. It was now a sadly-bedraggled substitute for a blanket. The others had webs of jeans sewed to gether. The buttons were gone from their garments in many essential places, and replaced by strings, nails, skewers and thorns. Worst of all, almost every one of them was nearly shoeless. A sudden impulse seized Si. \"Shorty,\" said he, \"these men are going up where the weather is very cold. I wish I was able to54 give each of them a warm suit of clothes and a blanket. I ain\u0027t though. But I tell you what I will do; I\u0027ll go down to the Quartermaster and see if he\u0027ll issue me a pair of shoes for each of \u0027em, and charge it to my clothin\u0027 account.\" \"Bully idee,\" ejaculated Shorty. \"I\u0027ll go you halves. Mebbe if they git their understandin\u0027 into Yankee leather it\u0027ll help git some Yankee idees into their understandin\u0027. See?\" And Shorty was so delighted with his little joke that he laughed over it all the way to the Quarter master\u0027s wagon, and then rehearsed it for that officer\u0027s entertainment. Fortunately, the Quartermaster had a box of shoes that he could get at without much trouble, and he was in sufficiently good humor to grant Si\u0027s request. They added a warm pair of socks to each pair of shoes, and so wrought up the A. Q. M.\u0027s sympathies that he threw in some damaged overcoats, and other articles, which he said he could report \"lost in action.\" They came back loaded with stuff, which they dumped down on the ground before the prisoners, with the brief remark: \"Them\u0027s, all yours. Put \u0027em on.\" The prisoners were overwhelmed by this generosity on the part of their foes and captors. \"I alluz thought,\" said the Sergeant, \"that you Yankees wuz not half so bad ez I believed that yo\u0027uns wuz. Yo\u0027uns is white men, if yo\u0027uns do want to take away our niggers.\" \"Gosh,\" said the man who had uttered the opinion that it was a rich man\u0027s war and a poor man\u0027s fight,55 \"I\u0027d give all my interest in every nigger in Tennessee for that ere one pa\u0027r o\u0027 shoes. They\u0027re beauties, I tell you. I never had so good a pa\u0027r afore in all my life.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63215.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
