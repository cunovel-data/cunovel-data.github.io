{"id":45135,"no":100,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. AN UNEXPECTED MEETING","content":"BREAKING UP A DEN OF COPPERHEADS. \n \n \"COME, hustle these prisoners back into the car in which we were,\" commanded the Lieutenant. \"We\u0027ll leave it on the switch with a guard. Lock it up carefully, and one man\u0027ll be enough to guard it until we get back. Make haste, for we\u0027ve no time to lose. Shorty.\" \n \n \"Corpril Elliott,\" Shorty corrected him, mindful of the presence of Sergeant Bob Ramsey. \n \n \"Yes; excuse me. Corporal Elliott, while we are attending to the prisoners you go on ahead and reconnoiter. You need not stop unless you see fit until you are clear into the lodge. Give one low whistle if you want us to stop, two to come ahead and three to go back.\" \n \n It was a moonless night, and the broom-like tops of the close-growing beeches made a dense darkness, into which Shorty plunged, but he could readily make out a well-beaten path, which he followed. Occasionally he could make out dark figures moving just ahead of him or crossing the path. \n \n \"Goin\u0027 to be a full attendance at the services this evenin\u0027,\" he muttered to himself. \"But the more the merrier. It\u0027ll insure a goodly number at the mourner\u0027s bench when we make the call for the unconverted.\" \n \n Big and lumbering as Shorty sometimes seemed in his careless hours, no wildcat gliding through the brush was more noiseless-footed than he now. He kept on the darker side of the path, but not a twig seemed to crack or a leaf rustle under his heavy brogans. Twice he heard lumbering steps in his rear, and he slipped behind the big trunk of a tree, and saw the men pass almost within arm\u0027s length, but without a suspicion of his presence. \n \n \"Well, for men workin\u0027 a dark-lantern job this is about the logiest crowd I ever struck,\" he said rather disgustedly. \"An elephant\u0027d have to step on \u0027em before they\u0027d know he was around. They ain\u0027t hardly good fun.\" \n \n Presently he heard some rustling over to his right and caught the low murmur of a voice. He cautiously made his way in that direction until he made an opening, with a number of men sitting on a log, while others were standing, leaning on their guns. \n \n \"Probably a caucus outside to set up the pins before goin\u0027 into the full meetin\u0027,\" he said to himself. \"As I always like to be with the winnin\u0027 side, I guess I\u0027ll jest jine \u0027em.\" \n \n He advanced boldly into the opening. At the sound of his approach the men looked up, and one of those leaning on his gun picked it up and came toward him. \n \n \"You are out late,\" he whispered, when within speaking distance. \n \n \"Yes,\" answered Shorty. \"And I was out late last night.\" \n \n \"Did you see a star?\" \n \n \"I did.\" \n \n \"What star was it?\" \n \n \"It was the Star of Bethlehem.\" \n \n The first speaker had seemed to start at the sound of Shorty\u0027s voice, but he recovered himself, and saying, \"You\u0027re right, my brother,\" put out his hand for the grip. \n \n \"\u0027Taint right, neither,\" hissed Shorty. \"Si Klegg, what are you doin\u0027 here?\" \n \n \"Shorty!\" ejaculated Si, joyfully, but still in a whisper. \"I thought I knowed your voice. Where in the world did you come from?\" \n \n \"I\u0027m here on business,\" answered Shorty. \"I came up from Headquarters at Jeffersonville. What brung you here?\" \n \n \"O,\" said Si, \"we\u0027ve bin hearin\u0027 about this Copperhead lodge for some time, and some of us boys who\u0027s home on furlough thought that we\u0027d come down here with the Deputy Provo and bust it up. We\u0027ve bin plannin\u0027 it a week or two. All these that you see, there are soldiers. I\u0027ve 15, includin\u0027 myself.\" \n \n The boys hastily conferred together as to the plan of operations, and one man was hurried back to inform Lieut. Bigelow of the presence of the other squad. \n \n \"You seem to know most about this affair. Shorty,\" said Si. \"You take command and make arrangements.\" \n \n \"Not for a minute. Si,\" protested Shorty. \"You rank me and you must command, and I want you to hold your own over Bob Ramsey, who will try to rank you. Bob\u0027s a good boy, but he\u0027s rather too much stuck on his stripes.\" \n \n It was finally arranged that Si should move his squad out to near the edge of the path and wait for Lieut. Bigelow to come up, while Shorty should go forward and reconnoiter. \n \n Shorty walked along the path toward the lodge. Suddenly the large figure of a man loomed up before him, standing motionless, on guard, in the road. \n \n \"You are out late, my friend,\" said he. \n \n \"Yes,\" answered Shorty. \n \n \"Did you see a star?\" \n \n \"Yes.\" \n \n \"What was it?\" \n \n \"The Star of Bethlehem.\" \n \n \"You are right, my brother,\" said the man, extending his hand for the grip. \n \n \"This rotten star-and-brother rigmarole\u0027s making me sick,\" muttered Shorty, with a hasty glance to see that the man was alone, and grasping his hand with a grip of iron, while with his left he clutched the sentry\u0027s throat. Before the man could utter a groan he wrenched him around and started him back for Si. Arriving there he flung him under the trees, saying in a loud whisper: \n \n \"First sucker o\u0027 this Spring\u0027s run. String him. Si.\" \n \n Lieut. Bigelow had come up in the meanwhile with the other squad, and they all moved cautiously forward to where they could get a dim sight of the lodge through the intervals between the trees. For a log house it was quite a large building, and stood in the center of a small clearing which had been made to furnish logs for its erection. Faint gleams of light came through the badly-chinked walls, and the hum of voices showed that there was a large crowd gathered inside. \n \n \"There\u0027s likely to be from 100 to 150 in there,\" said the Lieutenant, after a moment\u0027s consideration. \"We\u0027ve got 27 or 28. We\u0027ll jump them, though, if they\u0027re a thousand. Corporal Elliott, you go forward and make your way inside, if you can, and see what they are doing. If you can get inside, stay 10 or 15 minutes, and come out and report. If you can\u0027t get out, or you think they are ripe for jumping, whistle, and we\u0027ll pile in. Sergeant Klegg, you hold your squad together and move down as near the door as you can without being seen and be ready for a rush. Find a rail or a log to smash the door in if they try to hold it against us. Sergeant Ramsey, deploy your men quietly around to the rear there to cut off retreat, but be ready to rally again and help Sergeant Klegg out if he strikes a big snag. You make the circuit of the house and post yourself where you can see what\u0027s going on, and signal your men. Everybody keep under the shadow of the trees and make no noise. Go on to the house, Corporal.\" \n \n Shorty left the cover of the trees and walked directly toward the front door. No one appeared or halted him until he pushed the front door open. Then a man who seemed more intent on what was going on inside than the new arrival, bent his head over to catch the farrago about the star, and put out his hand for the grip. \n \n \"Come on in, but don\u0027t make a noise,\" he whispered. \"They\u0027re givin\u0027 the obligation, and I want to hear it.\" \n \n Shorty stood beside him for a moment, and then watched his opportunity, and pressed by him, to where he could see into the room. It was entirely dark except for the light of a single candle, shaded so that its rays fell upon a rude altar in the center of the room, draped with a rebel flag. Upon this lay a naked sword, skull and cross-bones. Behind the altar stood a masked man, draped in a long shroud, who was mouthing in a sepulchral tone the obligation to several men kneeling in front of the altar. The dim light faintly revealed other masked and shrouded figures stationed at various places about the room and looming above the seated audience. \n \n \"You solemnly swear,\" droned the chief actor, \"to resist to the death every attempt to place the nigger above the white man and destroy the Government of our fathers.\" \n \n \"We do,\" responded those kneeling at the altar. \n \n \"Let it be so recorded,\" said a sepulchral voice from the other extremity of the room. A gong sounded dismally and a glare of lurid red light filled the room. \n \n \"Regler Sons o\u0027 Malty biziniss, like I seen in St. Looyey,\" commented Shorty to himself. \"Masks, shrouds, red fire and gong, all the same. But where\u0027ve I heard that croakin\u0027 voice before?\" \n \n \"You solemnly promise and swear,\" resumed the sepulchral tones of the chief actor, \"to do all in your power to restore the Constitution and laws of this country to what were established by the fathers and resist the efforts of nigger-loving Abolitionists and evil-minded fanatics to subvert them.\" \n \n \"We do,\" responded the kneeling men. \n \n Again the grewsome gong sounded, the red fire glared forth and the hollow voice announced that it was so recorded. \n \n \"I\u0027ll bet six bits to a picayune,\" said Shorty to himself, \"that I know the rooster who\u0027s doin\u0027 them high priest antics. Where\u0027d I hear his voice before?\" \n \n \"And, finally, brethren,\" resumed the chief actor, \"do you solemnly promise and swear to cheerfully obey all orders given you by officers regularly appointed over you according to the rules and regulations of this great order and military discipline?\" \n \n There was a little hesitation about this, but the kneeling ones were nudged and whispered to, and finally responded: \n \n \"We do.\" \n \n Again it was funereally announced to the accompaniment of flashes of red fire and the gong that it was duly recorded. \n \n \"Great Jehosephat, if it ain\u0027t old Billings himself that\u0027s doin\u0027 that heavy tragedy act,\" said Shorty, slapping himself on the thigh. \"The old dregs o\u0027 the bottomless pit! Is there any deviltry that he won\u0027t git into?\" \n \n His decision was confirmed a minute or two later, when, after some more fanfarronade the initiation ended, the officers removed their masks and shrouds, and the candles in the sconces around the room were relighted. Billings took his seat on the platform at the end of the room farthest from the door, picked up the gavel and rapped for order. \n \n \"Now, brethren,\" said he, \"having witnessed the solemn initiation of several brave, true men into our rapidly-swelling ranks and welcomed them as real patriots who have united with us to resist to the bitter end the cruel tyrannies of the Abolition despot at Washington—the vulgar railsplitter of the Sangamon, who is filling this once happy land with the graves of his victims, we will proceed to the regular business for which we have assembled. I regret that our gallant Captain has not yet arrived with the supply of arms and ammunition that he went to Jeffersonville to secure. I thought I heard the whistle of the train some time ago, and have been expecting him every minute. He may be here yet.\" \n \n \"Not if that guard at the switch \u0027tends to his little business, he won\u0027t,\" Shorty chuckled to himself. \n \n \"When he gets here,\" continued Billings, \"we shall have enough weapons to finish our outfit, and give every member, including them initiated tonight, a good, serviceable arm, as effective as any in the hands of our enemies. We shall then be in shape to carry out the several projects which we have before discussed and planned. We shall be ready to strike at any moment. When we do strike success is sure. The Southern armies, which have so long bravely battled for the Constitution and the laws and white men\u0027s rights, are again advancing from every point. Every mail brings me glad good news of the organization of our brave friends throughout this State and Illinois. They\u0027re impatient to begin. The first shot fired will be the signal for an uprising that\u0027ll sweep over the land like a prairie fire and—\" \n \n He stopped abruptly, contracted his brows, and gazed fixedly at Shorty. \n \n \"Brother Walker,\" said Billings, \"there\u0027s a tall man settin\u0027 close by the door that I seem to\u0027ve seen before, and yit I don\u0027t exactly recognize. Please hold that candle nigh his face till I can see it more plainly.\" \n \n Shorty happened to be looking at another man that minute, and did not at first catch the drift of Billings\u0027s remarks. When he did, he hesitated an instant whether to whistle or try to get out. Before he could decide, Eph Glick, whom he had raided at Jeffersonville, struck him a heavy blow on the side of his head and yelled: \n \n \"He\u0027s a traitor! He\u0027s a spy! Kill the infernal, egg-suckin\u0027 hound!\" \n \n There was a rush of infuriated men, which carried Shorty over and made him the object of a storm of blows and kicks. So many piled on him at once that they struck and kicked one another in their confusion. The door was torn out, and its pieces fell with the tumble of cursing, striking, kicking men that rolled outside. \n \n Si rushed forward with his squad, and in an instant they were knocking right and left with their gun-barrels. So many fell on top of Shorty that he was unable to rise and extricate himself. \n \n Not exactly comprehending what was going on, but thinking that the time for them to act had come, the four boys to whom Si had given the duty of making the rush with the log to break down the door, came bolting up, shouting to their comrades: \n \n \"Open out, there, for us.\" \n \n \u0027the Prisoners Had Too Much Solicitude About Their Garments to Think of Anything Else.\u0027 185 \n \n Their battering-ram cleaned off the rest of those still pommeling Shorty, and drove back those who were swarming in the door. \n \n Shorty sprang up and gave a rib-breaking kick to the prostrate Eph Glick. \n \n The crowd inside at first recoiled at the sight of the soldiers, but, frightened for his own safety, Billings shouted, as he sheltered himself behind the altar: \n \n \"Don\u0027t give way, men. There\u0027s only a few o\u0027 them. Draw your revolvers and shoot down the scum. Drive \u0027em away.\" \n \n A score of shots were fired in obedience, but Si, making his voice ring above the noise, called out: \n \n \"Stop that firing, or I\u0027ll kill every man in the house. If there\u0027s another shot fired we\u0027ll open on you and keep it up till you\u0027re every one dead. Surrender at once!\" \n \n \"Go at \u0027em with the bayonet, Si,\" yelled Shorty. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 around to ketch old Billings. He\u0027s in there, and\u0027ll try to sneak out the back way.\" \n \n As Shorty ran around the corner he came face-to-face with a stalwart Irishman, one of the pluckiest of the squad brought from Jeffersonville. His face was drawn and white with fright, and he fumbled at his beads. \n \n \"O, Corpril,\" he said, with chattering teeth, \"Oi\u0027ve jist sane the very divil himself, so Oi have. Oi started to run up t\u0027 the house whin the ruction begun, when suddintly the ground opened up at me very fate, an\u0027 out kim a ghost, tin fate hoigh, wid oyes av foire, and brathing flames, an\u0027 he shtarted for me, an\u0027 oi—\" \n \n \"What damned nonsense is this, O\u0027Brien?\" asked Shorty angrily. \"Are you drunk, or jest naturally addled? Come along with me and we\u0027ll—\" \n \n \"Not for a thousand loives,\" groaned the Irishman. \"Howly saints, fwhat is old Clootie after me for? Is it for atin\u0027 that little taste o\u0027 ham last Friday? Holy Mary, save me; there he is again!\" \n \n \"Where, you flannel-mouthed Mick?\" asked Shorty savagely. \"Where do you see the devil?\" \n \n \"There! There! That white thing. Don\u0027t you say it yersilf?\" groaned the Irishman, dropping on his knees, and calling on all the saints. \n \n \"That white thing. That\u0027s only a sycamore stump, you superstitious bog-trotter,\" said Shorty, with angry contempt, as he bent his eyes on the white object. Then he added in the next breath: \n \n \"But blamed if that stump ain\u0027t walkin\u0027 off. Funny stump.\" \n \n He gave a leap forward for closer investigation. At the crash of his footsteps the stump actually turned around and gave a sepulchral groan. Then, seeing that it was not a soldier pursuing, a very natural human voice proceeded from it. \n \n \"Is that you, Brother Welch? I thought at first it was a soldier. I motioned you when the trouble first begun to follow me through the underground passage. There was enough others there to make the fight, and it\u0027d never do for us to be taken by the Lincolnites. We\u0027re too valuable to the cause just now, and, then, if the Lincolnites get hold of me they\u0027ll certainly make me a martyr. Come right over this way. We kin strike a path near here that\u0027ll take us right out.\" \n \n \"Great Jehosephat,\" said Shorty, \"if it ain\u0027t old Billings, masqueradin\u0027 in his Sons o\u0027 Malty rig.\" \n \n He made another leap or two, clapped his hand on Billings\u0027s shoulder, and shoved the muzzle of his revolver against the mask and demanded: \n \n \"Halt and surrender, you barrel-headed, splayfooted son of a sardine. Come along with me, or I\u0027ll blow that whole earthquake rig offen you.\" \n \n Shorty marched his prisoner back to the house, and as he neared it saw by the light of a fire O\u0027Brien, who had apparently recovered from his fright, for he was having a lively bout with a large young fellow who was trying to make his escape. It seemed an even thing for a minute or two, but the Irishman finally downed his antagonist by a heavy blow with his massive fist. \n \n \"Here, O\u0027Brien,\" said Shorty, \"I\u0027ve ketched your devil and brung him back to you. When a boss shies at anything the best way\u0027s to lead him square up to it and let him smell it. So I want you to take charge o\u0027 this prisoner and hold him safe till the scrimmage is over.\" \n \n O\u0027Brien looked at the figure with rage and disgust. He gave Billings a savage clout with his open hand, saying: \n \n \"Ye imp o\u0027 the divil—ye unblest scab of an odmahoun. Oi\u0027ll brake ivery bone av yer body for goin\u0027 around by noights in thim wake-duds, scaring daysint folks out av their siven sinses.\" \n \n The fighting had been quite a severe tussle for the soldiers. There had not been much shooting, but a great deal of clubbing with gun-barrels and sticks, which left a good many bloody heads and aching arms and shoulders. About half of those in the meeting had succeeded in getting away, but this still left some 75 prisoners in the hands of Lieut. Bigelow, and he was delighted with his success. \n \n It was decided to hold all the prisoners in the lodge until morning, and two of the boys who had gotten pretty badly banged about the head were sent back to the railroad to relieve and assist the guard left there. \n \n \"I find about 10 or 15 birds in the flock,\" said the Deputy Provost, who was also Deputy Sheriff, when they looked over the prisoners in the morning, \"that we have warrants and complaints for, for everything from plain assault and battery to horse-stealing. It would save the military much trouble and serve the ends of justice better if we could send them over to the County seat and put them in jail, where the civil authorities could get a whack at them. I\u0027d go there myself if I could walk, but this bullet in my shin disables me.\" \n \n \"I\u0027d like to do it,\" answered Lieut. Bigelow, \"but I haven\u0027t the guard to spare. So many of my men got disabled that I won\u0027t have more than enough to guard the cars on the way back and keep these whelps from jumping the train or being rescued by their friends when we stop at the stations. The news of this affair is all over the country by this time, and their friends will all be out.\" \n \n \"How fur is it to the County seat?\" asked Shorty. \n \n \"About 15 miles,\" answered the Deputy Provost. \n \n \"Me and Si Klegg\u0027ll march \u0027em over there, and obligate ourselves not to lose a rooster of \u0027em,\" said Shorty. \n \n \"That\u0027ll be a pretty big contract,\" said the Lieutenant doubtfully. \n \n \"All right. We\u0027re big enough for it. We\u0027ll take every one of \u0027em in if we have to haul some of \u0027em feet foremost in a wagon.\" \n \n \"It\u0027ll be a great help in many ways,\" considered Lieut. Bigelow. \"The crowd\u0027ll be looking for us at the stations and not think of these others. Those are two very solid men, and will do just what they promise. I think I\u0027ll let them try it. It would be well for you to tell those men that any monkey business with them will be unhealthy. They\u0027d better trust to getting away from the grand jury than from them.\" \n \n But as the Deputy Provost went over them more carefully he found more that were \"wanted\" by the civil authorities, and presently had selected 25 very evil-looking fellows, whose arrest would have been justified on general appearances. \n \n \"Haint we bit off more\u0027n we kin chaw. Shorty?\" asked Si, as he looked over the increasing gang. \"Hadn\u0027t we better ask for some help?\" \n \n \"Not a bit of it,\" answered Shorty, confidently. \"That\u0027ll look like weakenin\u0027 to the Lieutenant and the Provo. We kin manage this gang, or we\u0027ll leave \u0027em dead in the brush.\" \n \n \"All right,\" assented Si, who had as little taste as his partner for seeming to weaken. \"Here goes for a fight or a foot-race.\" \n \n While the Deputy was making out a list of the men and writing a note to the Sheriff, Shorty went through the gang and searched each man for arms. Then he took out his knife and carefully cut the suspender buttons from every one of their pantaloons. \n \n \"Now we\u0027ve got \u0027em, Si,\" he said gleefully, as he returned to his partner\u0027s side, with his hand full of buttons. \"They\u0027ll have to use both hands to hold their britches on, so they kin neither run nor fight. They\u0027ll be as peaceable as lambs.\" \n \n \"Shorty,\" said Si, in tones of fervent admiration, \"I wuz afeared that crack you got on your head softened your brains. But now I see it made you brighter\u0027n ever. You\u0027ll be wearin\u0027 a General\u0027s stars before this war is over.\" \n \n \"Bob Ramsey was a-blowin\u0027 about knowin\u0027 how to handle men,\" answered Shorty. \"I\u0027m just goin\u0027 to bring him over here and show him this trick that he never dreamed of.\" \n \n After he had gloated over Sergeant Ramsey, Shorty got his men into the road ready to start. Si placed himself in front of the squad and deliberately loaded his musket in their sight. Shorty took his place in the rear, and gave out: \n \n \"Now, you roosters, you see I\u0027ve two revolvers, and I\u0027m a dead shot with either hand. I\u0027m good for 12 of you at the first jump and my partner kin \u0027tend to the rest. Now, if I see a man so much as make a motion toward the side o\u0027 the road I\u0027ll drop him. Give the command. Sergeant Klegg.\" \n \n \"Forward—march!\" ordered Si. \n \n It was as Shorty predicted. The prisoners had entirely too much solicitude about their garments to think of anything else, and the march was made without incident. Late in the afternoon they reached the County seat, and marched directly for the public square, in which the jail was situated. There were a few people on the streets, who gathered on the sidewalks to watch the queer procession. Shorty, with both hands on his revolvers, had his eyes fixed on the squad, apprehensive of an attempt to bolt and mix with the crowd. He looked neither to the right nor the left, but was conscious that they were passing a corner on which stood some ladies. Then he heard a voice which set his heart to throbbing call out: \n \n \"Hello, Si Klegg! Si Klegg! Look this way. Where\u0027d you come from?\" \n \n \"Great Jehosephat! Maria!\" said Shorty to himself. But he dared not take his eyes a moment from the squad to look toward her. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63287.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
