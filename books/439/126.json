{"id":45161,"no":126,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. GATHERING UP THE BOYS AFTER THE BATTLE.","content":"\"HOORAY for Injianny. Injianny gits there every time,\" roared Si, joining the yelling, exultant throng crowding around the Colonel. \"The old 200th wuz the first to cross the works, and miles ahead o\u0027 any other rejimint.\" \"Bully for the Wild Wanderers of the Wabash,\" Shorty joined in. \"They\u0027re the boss regiment in the army o\u0027 the Cumberland, and the Army o\u0027 the Cumberland\u0027s the boss army on earth. Hooray for US Co. Le\u0027s have a speech. Where\u0027s Monty Scruggs?\" \"Yes, Where\u0027s Monty?\" echoed Si, with a little chill at his heart, for he had not remembered seeing the boy since they emerged from the abatis, just before the final rush. \"Well, le\u0027s have a song, then,\" said Shorty, as Si was looking around. \"Where\u0027s Alf Russell?\" \"Yes, Where\u0027s Alf Russell?\" echoed Si, with a new pang clutching at his heart, for he then recalled that he had not seen Alf since he had helped him up the embankment, immediately after which Si\u0027s thoughts, had been engrossed by the struggle for the flag. \"Did any of you boys see either Alf or Monty?\" he asked nervously. \"And has anybody seen Pete Skidmore?\" chimed in Shorty, his voice suddenly changing from a tone of exultation to one of deepest concern. \"Why don\u0027t some o\u0027 you speak? Are you all dumb?\" Somehow everybody instinctively stopped cheering, and an awed hush followed. \"All of Co. Q step this way,\" called out the Orderly-Sergeant. All of the usual \"rasp\" had left the strong, rough voice. There was a mournful tremor in it. \"Fall in, Co. Q, over there by this pile of picks and shovels.\" Scarcely 20 of the 80 stalwart youths who had lined up at the foot of the rugged palisades of Rocky Face two evenings before grouped themselves together in response to the Orderly\u0027s call. Capt. McGillicuddy, the Orderly, Si, and Shorty strained their eyes to see more of the company disengaging themselves from the throng around the Colonel. The Orderlies of the other companies called to their men to fall in at different places. The Colonel looked at the muster with sad eyes. \"Didn\u0027t nobody see nothin\u0027 o\u0027 little Skidmore?\" savagely repeated Shorty, walking back to the works and scanning the country round. \"Was you all so blamed anxious lookin\u0027 out for yourselves that you didn\u0027t pay no attention to that little boy? Nice gang, you are.\" \"Orderly, take the company back into the abatis, and look for the boys,\" ordered Capt. McGillicuddy. \"\u0027Tention, company!\" commanded the Orderly. \"Stack arms! Right face—Break ranks—March!\" \"Hello, boys,\" said Monty Scruggs\u0027s voice, weak but unmistakably his, as the company recrossed the works. \"Great heavens! he\u0027s bin shot through the bowels?\" thought Si, turning toward him with sickening apprehension of this most dreaded of wounds. Then, aloud, with forced cheerfulness—\"I hope you ain\u0027t hurt bad, Monty.\" \"I was hurt bad enough, the Lord knows,\" answered the boy with a wan smile. \"I hain\u0027t been hurt so bad since I stubbed by sore toe last Summer. But I\u0027m getting over it pretty fast. Just as I started up the bank a rebel threw a stone as big as my fist at me, and it took me square where I live. I thought at first that whole battery over there in the fort had shot at me all at once. Goodness, but it hurt! My, but that fellow could throw a stone! Seemed to me that it went clear into me, and bent my back-bone. I\u0027ve been feeling to see if it wasn\u0027t bent. But we got the works all right, didn\u0027t we?\" \"You bet we did,\" Si answered exultantly. \"Licked the stuffin\u0027 out of \u0027em. Awful glad you\u0027re no worse hurt, Monty. Make your way inside there, and you\u0027ll find the Surgeon. He\u0027ll bring you around all right. We\u0027re goin\u0027 to look for the other boys.\" \"Alf Russell caught a bullet,\" said Monty Scruggs. \"I heard him yell, and turned to look at him, when that rebel\u0027s bowlder gave me something else to think about, so I don\u0027t know where he is.\" \"Gid Mackall\u0027s lying over there, somewhere,\" said Larry Joslyn, who was all anxiety in regard to his old partner and antagonist. \"Let me go and find him.\" \"Go ahead,\" said Si, helping Monty to his feet. \"I\u0027ll be right with you.\" While Si was going back the way he had come Shorty was tearing through the tangled brush, turning over the tree-tops by main strength, searching for Pete Skidmore. The rest of the company were seeking out the fallen ones hither and thither, and calling to one another, as they made discoveries, but Shorty only looked for Pete Skidmore. Si and Harry presently came to Gid Mackall\u0027s body, lying motionless in a pool of blood that dyed crimson the brown leaves thickly covering the ground. His cap had fallen off, and his head had crushed down into a bunch of slender oak twigs; his eyes were closed, and his callow face white as paper. \"O, he\u0027s dead! He\u0027s stone dead,\" wailed Harry Joslyn. \"And just think how I quarreled and fought with him this morning.\" \"Mebbe not,\" said Si, to whom such sights were more familiar, \"That bullet hole in his blouse is too low down and too fur out to\u0027ve hit either his heart or his lungs, seems to me. Mebbe he\u0027s only fainted from loss o\u0027 blood. Ketch hold o\u0027 his feet. I\u0027ll take his head, and we\u0027ll carry him back to the Surgeon. Likely he kin bring him to.\" The rough motion roused Gid, and as they clambered back over the works, Harry was thrilled to see him open his eyes a little ways. \"Apparently,\" said the busy Surgeon, stopping for a minute, with knife and bullet-forceps in his bloodstained hands, to give a brief glance and two or three swift touches to Gid, \"the ball has struck his side and broke a rib or two. He\u0027s swooned from loss of blood. The blood\u0027s stopped flowing now, and he\u0027ll come around all right. Lay him over there in the shade of those trees. Put something under his head, and make him as comfortable as possible. I\u0027ll attend to him as soon as I can get through with these men who are much worse off than he is.\" And the over-worked Surgeon hurried away to where loud groans were imperatively calling for his helpful ministrations. Si and Harry broke down a thick layer of cedar branches to make a comfortable bed for Gid, placed a chunk under his head, and hurried away again to search for Alf Russell. They went over carefully that part of the works they had crossed, and the abatis in front, but could find no trace of him. They feared that after he had been shot he had crawled back under the shelter of some tree-tops, to protect him from the flying bullets, and died there. They turned over and pulled apart the branches for a wide space, but did not succeed in finding him, or any trace. But they found Bob Willis, stark in death, lying prone in the top of a young hickory, into which he had crashed, when the fatal bullet found him pressing courageously forward. Him they carried pitifully forward, and added to the lengthening row of the regiment\u0027s dead, which was being gathered up. Then they went reluctantly back—shuddering with the certainty of what they should find, to bring in Jim Humphreys\u0027s body. Harry Joslyn was so agitated by the sight of Humphreys\u0027s mangled head and staring eyes that Si made him turn his back, place himself between the feet, one of which he took in each hand, and go before in carrying the body back. Si stripped the blouse up so as to cover the head, and took the shoulders between his hands, and so another body was added to the row of the regimental dead. Si himself was so sick at heart that he had little inclination to continue the search farther than to look over the wounded, as they were brought in, in hopes of finding some of his squad there. \"There are three of us yet missing,\" he said. \"Mebbe they\u0027ve got mixed up with the Kankakee boys on our left, and\u0027ll come in all right after awhile. Mebbe they\u0027re out with Shorty somewhere. I\u0027ll wait till he comes in. Harry, I expect me and you\u0027d better dig poor Jim\u0027s grave. There\u0027s no tellin\u0027 how long we\u0027ll stay here. Jim \u0027d rather we put him under than strangers what don\u0027t know and care for him. It\u0027s all we kin do for the poor feller; I\u0027ll git a pick and you take a shovel. We\u0027ll make the grave right here, where the Colonel lit when he jumped over the works with the flag. That\u0027ll tickle Jim, if he\u0027s lookin\u0027 down from the clouds. Too bad, he couldn\u0027t have lived long enough to see us go over the embankment, with the Colonel in the lead, wavin\u0027 the flag.\" \"The best thing,\" said Harry, forgetting his sorrow in the exciting memories of the fight, \"was to see the Orderly sock his bayonet up to the shank in the rebel, and you blow off that officer\u0027s head—\" \"Hush, Harry. Never speak o\u0027 that,\" Si admonished him. \"And see you,\" continued Harry, \"stand off all three of them rebels, who was tryin\u0027 to bayonet you, until Corp\u0027l Elliott came raring down, swinging his gun like a flail. Great Scott! didn\u0027t he lay \u0027em out, though! I saw it all, as I was loading my gun in nine times to shoot one of the rebels attacking you, I\u0027d just got the cap on, when Corp\u0027l Elliott loped in.\" \"Orderly,\" said Si a little later, \"we\u0027ve got Jim Humphreys\u0027s grave dug. Will you take the things out of his pockets to send to his folks? and then we\u0027ll bury him.\" \"Better wait till the Captain comes back and gives the orders,\" said the Orderly. \"I don\u0027t want to touch his pockets without the Captain\u0027s orders. Then, we ought to have his blanket to bury him in. You go ahead and dig Bob Willis\u0027s grave, and I\u0027ll take a detail back and bring up the blankets and things.\" Shorty had pushed his unavailing search for little Pete far past the point where he remembered to have seen the boy, in the midst of the fighting. He had torn his hands and worn out his strength in tearing aside the brush to expose every possible place that the dying boy or his dead body might be concealed. He had reached the further side of the obstruction, and sat down on a stump, in despair of heart and exhaustion of body. Those with him, more intent on getting something to eat, had pushed on back to where their haversacks and canteens and blankets had been left. Presently Shorty heard a call across the little valley: \"Cor—po—ral Ell—iott. Cor—po—ral Ell—iott!\" \"Well, what is it?\" Shorty called back, crustily. \"Lit—tle—Pete—and—Sandy—Ba—ker—is—o—ver—here,\" came back upon the bright Spring air. Shorty sprang up electrified, and tore across the intervening space at the double-quick. He found Pete and Sandy Baker standing soberly on guard over the line of the company\u0027s blankets and belongings. \"Great Jehosephat, you little brats, how did you git here?\" he exclaimed, snatching little Pete up and hugging him. \"Why shouldn\u0027t we be here?\" asked Pete, as soon as he could get breath. \"Didn\u0027t the Captain order us to stay here? Me and Sandy follered you fellers until you jumped inside the works, and the rebels was a runnin\u0027. We stood on top o\u0027 the bank and shot at the rebels as fast as we could load our guns. We kept shootin\u0027 at \u0027em till they got clean down to the road. Then we saw the Captain lookin\u0027 over our way, and we thought he was comin\u0027 over there to skin us alive for leaving the things, and we ducked down behind the bank and run back here as fast as we could fetch it. You ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to tell the Captain on us, and have us tied up by the thumbs, are you, Corporal? Everything\u0027s safe. Nothing\u0027s gone. You won\u0027t tell, will you?\" \"O, you worthless little scamp,\" said Shorty, with tears of joy in his eyes. \"You ain\u0027t worth the powder that\u0027d blow you up. I could pound you for the worry you\u0027ve given me in the last hour. But you ain\u0027t hurt a bit, are you?\" \"Nope,\" answered Pete. \"But we both got awfully scratched runnin\u0027 through that brush. Say, wasn\u0027t the way the boys jumped the works and waded into them sardines just grand?\" The Orderly-Sergeant and his detail came back for the things, and Shorty and the boys, picking up those belonging to the squad, made their way to the company. By the time they got back everybody\u0027s emotions had subsided sufficiently to allow him to remember that he was terribly hungry, and that the next business in order should be the cooking of the first warm meal they had had for more than a day. Fires were soon blazing in every direction, and the air was fragrant with the smell of hot coffee and cooking meat. Even Monty Scruggs felt that the kink had gone out of his backbone, and the disturbance in his dietetic department had sufficiently subsided to allow him to enjoy a cup of coffee and piece of toasted meat on a hardtack. The Surgeon had reached Gid Mackall, and had put him in comfortable shape. The bodies of Bob Willis and Jim Humphreys were wrapped in their blankets, and mournfully consigned to the earth. A cedar bush was stuck in the head of each grave, and Si, finding a piece of smooth board and a chunk of soft charcoal from a fire, sat down on the bank, and begun laboriously composing the following inscription: JAMES HUMFRI CO. Q. 200th injianny VolunTer Infantry KiLD may, 15th 1864 He dide For His country The lord luvs a Braiv man \"That\u0027s all right. Si,\" said Shorty coming up with his mouthful of hardtack and meat, and inspecting Si\u0027s work with critical approval. \"You kin lay away over me and all the rest when it comes to writin\u0027 and composin\u0027. And you know how to spell, too. I wish I had your education. But I never had a chance to go to school.\" \"Then you think it\u0027ll do, Shorty,\" said Si, much flattered by his partner\u0027s approval. \"Yes, it\u0027s just bully. But I think you ought to say something about Jim\u0027s good character. That\u0027s usual on tombstones. You might say of him that he had in him the makin\u0027 of the finest poker player in the Army of the Cumberland. I never see a sleepyheaded boy pick up the fine pints o\u0027 the game like he did, and he had nerve, too, along with his science.\" \"No, it wouldn\u0027t do at all to put anything o\u0027 that kind on,\" answered Si, going to the grave, and driving the board down with a pick. \"Mustn\u0027t let Jim\u0027s folks know for the world that he gambled. It\u0027d be the last straw on his poor old mother, who\u0027s a strict Baptist. She may stand hearing that he\u0027s killed, but never could that he played cards. What in the world\u0027s become of Alf Russell, do you s\u0027pose?\" \"Who in Jeff Davis\u0027s dominions is that comin\u0027 up?\" said Shorty, scanning an approaching figure. \"Looks as if he\u0027d had his head busted and then tied up agin with strings.\" The figure certainly looked like Alf Russell and wore Alf Russell\u0027s clothes, but the head was unrecognizable. A broad white bandage encircled the face, going from the top of the forehead around under the chin, and there were several folds of it. Then it ran around the head transversely, covering the nose and the cheeks, and only allowing the mouth and the eyes to show. \"Hello, boys,\" said a weak voice, which was unmistakably Alf Russell\u0027s. \"Hello, Alf,\" said Si delightedly. \"I\u0027m so glad to see you. I\u0027ve bin huntin\u0027 everywhere for you. What\u0027s happened to you? Badly hurt?\" \"Nothing, only the left side o\u0027 my head tore out,\" said Alf feebly. \"Something struck me, probably a bomb-shell, just as I was going up the bank after you. I went down to our Surgeon, but he was too busy to attend to me. I then found the brigade hospital, but the Surgeons there were too busy, too. They gave me a roll of bandages, and told me to fix it up myself. I did it with the help of one of the men who was waiting to have his leg dressed. I fancy I did quite a neat piece of bandaging, as well as the Surgeons themselves could\u0027ve done it. Don\u0027t you think so?\" \"Great Scott!\" gasped Si, \"you couldn\u0027t be walkin\u0027 around with the side of your head knocked out. I\u0027m astonished at you.\" \"So\u0027m I,\" returned Alf placidly. \"I\u0027m surprised that I\u0027m doing as well as I am. But I gave myself good attendance, and that\u0027s a great thing. I\u0027m awful hungry. Got anything to eat? Where\u0027s my haversack?\" \"Here it is,\" said Si, readily. \"And here\u0027s a cup o\u0027 hot coffee. I\u0027ll brile you a piece o\u0027 meat. But really, I don\u0027t think you ought to eat anything before the Surgeon sees you. Mebbe it won\u0027t be good for you.\" \"I\u0027ll chance it,\" said Alf desperately, reaching for the cup of coffee. \"I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll be better for me to eat something.\" \"Le\u0027s go down and see the Surgeon,\" insisted Si. \"No,\" protested Alf, \"it ain\u0027t hurting me much now, and he\u0027s awful busy with other men, so we hadn\u0027t better interrupt him.\" \"The Surgeon ought to see you at once, Alf,\" interjected Shorty. \"Here comes one of \u0027em now. Doctor, will you please look at this boy.\" \"Certainly,\" said the Surgeon, stopping on his way. \"I guess I can spare a minute. Take off that bandage, my boy.\" \"Don\u0027t mind me. Doctor,\" said Alf. \"\u0027Taint hurting me now, at all, scarcely. I did it up very carefully.\" \"Take off the bandage at once, I tell you,\" said the Surgeon imperatively. \"I haven\u0027t any time to waste. Let me see your wound.\" Alf set down his cup of coffee, and began laboriously unwinding the long bandage, while the rest stood around in anxious expectation. Yards of folds came off from around his forehead and chin, and then he reached that around his nose and the back of his head. Still the ghastly edges of the terrible wound did not develop. Finally the blood-soaked last layer came off, and revealed where a bullet had made a shallow but ugly-looking furrow across the cheek and made a nick in the ear. \"Alf, that rebel come dumbed nigh missin\u0027 you,\" said the greatly relieved Si. \"If you should happen to ketch cold in that it wouldn\u0027t git well for a week,\" added Shorty. \"Give me that bandage,\" said the Surgeon just before he hurried away. \"Take this sticking-plaster and draw the lips of the wound together, and if you keep the dirt out it may heal without a scar.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63313.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
