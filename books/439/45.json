THE PERPLEXED DEACON","content":"TROUBLED TO KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THE FREEDMAN. \"WHAT is yer a-gwine tub do wid me, mas\u0027r?\" asked the negro, with a look and an attitude curiously like a forlorn stray dog which had at last found an owner and protector. \"Wish to gracious I knowed,\" answered the Deacon, knitting his brows in thought. \"I don\u0027t know as I\u0027ve anything to do with you. I\u0027ve about as much idee what to do with you as I would with a whale in the Wabash River. I\u0027m neither John Brown nor a colonization society. I\u0027ve about as much use for a nigger, free or slave, as a frog has for a tail. You\u0027re free now that\u0027s all there is of it. Nobody\u0027s got nothin\u0027 to do with you. You\u0027ve got to do with yourself that\u0027s all. You\u0027re your own master. You go your way and let other folks go theirs.\" In the simplicity of his heart the Deacon thought he had covered the whole ground. What more could the man want, who had youth, health and strength, than perfect liberty to go where he pleased and strive for what he wanted? The negro looked dazed and perplexed. \"Isn\u0027t yo\u0027 a-gwine tuh take me wid yo\u0027, mas\u0027r?\" he asked. \"Take you with me!\" repeated the Deacon in253 astonishment and some petulance. \"Certainly not. I don\u0027t want you. And you mustn\u0027t call me master. You mustn\u0027t call any man master. You\u0027re no longer a slave. You\u0027re your own master. You\u0027re free; don\u0027t you understand?\" \"But whah\u0027m I tuh go?\" reiterated the negro hopelessly. \"Go where you please,\" repeated the Deacon with impatience. \"The whole world\u0027s open to you. Go to the next County; go to Kaintucky, Injianny, Ohio, Illinoy, Kamskatky, New Guiney, Jericho, or Polkinhorn\u0027s tanyard if you like.\" \"Afo\u0027 God, I don\u0027t know what tuh do, or wha tuh go,\" said the negro despairingly. \"If yo\u0027 leab me here, I know dat ole mas\u0027r \u0027ll fin\u0027 me an\u0027 done kill me daid.\" \"Niggers is like mules,\" remarked Groundhog savagely. \"They only know two places in the whole world: their master\u0027s place and somewhere else. They want to run away from their master, but they hain\u0027t nary idee whar to go when they run away. A hoss has more sense \u0027n either a nigger or a mule. When he lights out he\u0027s got some idee o\u0027 where he wants t\u0027 go. I tell you; jest give that nigger to me. I know what to do with him. I know a man that\u0027ll give me $100 for him, and I\u0027ll whack up fair and square with you.\" \"Shut up, you mullet-headed mule-whacker,\" said the Deacon irritably. \"You hain\u0027t got sense enough to take care o\u0027 mules right, let alone a man. I wouldn\u0027t trust you an hour with the poorest team on my place. I\u0027ll take care o\u0027 this man myself, at least, until I kin have a talk with the boys. Here, you nigger, what\u0027s your name?\"254 \"Dey call me Sam, mas\u0027r,\" replied the negro. \"Well, we\u0027ll change that. You\u0027re a free man, and I\u0027ll give you another name. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to call you Abraham—Abraham Lincoln the grandest name in the world to-day. For short I\u0027ll call you Abe. You must stop callin\u0027 me, or anybody, master, I tell you. You just call be Mister Klegg.\" \"Mistuh what?\" said the negro, puzzled. \"Well, jest call me boss. Now, Abe, climb up into the wagon here, and come along with me.\"255 \"He can\u0027t git into no wagon o\u0027 mine,\" said the teamster surlily. \"Government wagons ain\u0027t no passenger coaches for runaway niggers. I didn\u0027t hire to haul niggers on pleasure excursions. That ain\u0027t no part of a white man\u0027s bizniss. Let him walk alongside.\" \"You dumbed citizen,\" said the Deacon angrily. He had been in camp long enough to catch the feeling of the men toward the Quartermaster\u0027s civilian employees. \"This man shall ride in this wagon along side o\u0027 me, and you\u0027ll drive us into camp, or I\u0027ll find out the reason why. Now jest gether up your lines and start.\" \"I won\u0027t take no slack from no old Wabash hayseed like you,\" responded the teamster cordially. \"You can\u0027t boss me. You hain\u0027t no right. You can\u0027t ring me in to help you steal niggers, unless you divide with me. You come out here in the road and I\u0027ll punch that old sorrel-top head o\u0027 your\u0027n.\" And the teamster pranced out and brandished his blacksnake whip menacingly. It had been many years since anybody on the Wabash had dared Deacon Klegg to a match in fisticuffs. The memory of some youthful performances of his had secured him respectful immunity. His last affair had been a severe suppression of a noted bully who attempted to \"crowd the mourners\" at a camp-meeting for the good order of which the Deacon felt himself somewhat responsible. It took the bully six months to get over it, and he went to the mourner\u0027s bench himself at the next revival. The Deacon looked at the gesticulating teamster a minute, and the dormant impulse of his youth256 stirred again within him. He laid his gun down and calmly slid from the fodder to the ground. He pulled off his coat and hat, and laid them on the wagon. He took the quid of tobacco from his mouth, carefully selected a place for it on the edge of the wagon-bed, laid it there on a piece of corn-husk, and walked toward the teamster, rolling up his sleeves. The effect upon the monarch of the mules was immediate and marked. He stopped prancing around, and began to look alarmed. \"Now, don\u0027t you hit me,\" he yelled. \"I\u0027m the driver o\u0027 this team, and in Gov\u0027ment employ. If you hit me I\u0027ll have you courtmartialed.\" Do You Hear? Git on Your Mule at Onct.\u0027 \"I\u0027m not goin\u0027 to hit you,\" said the Deacon, raising a fist as big as a small ham, \"if you behave yourself. I want you to shut your mouth, and git on your mule and start for camp. If you don\u0027t \u0027tend to your bizness, or give me any more o\u0027 your sass, I\u0027ll pound the melt out o\u0027 you. D\u0027 you hear? Git on your mule at onct.\" frontispiecee (114K) The teamster did as he was bid, and drove on till they came up to where the boys were sitting on a fence-corner waiting for them. Si had a brace of chickens tied together by the feet, and Shorty a crock of honey in the comb, with a bag of saleratus biscuits and one of cornmeal, and a number of strings of dried apples. \"Bin waitin\u0027 for you a good while, Pap. What kep\u0027 you so long? Break-down?\" said Si. \"No; had to stop and argy the fugitive slave law with a Southern gentleman, and then debate niggers\u0027 civil rights with the teamster,\" said the Deacon. Then he told them the story. \"Here\u0027s the257 darky,\" he said, as he concluded. \"Seems to be a purty fair sort of a farm-hand, if he has sense enough to come in when it rains, which I misdoubt. What are we goin\u0027 to do with him?\" \"Do with him?\" said Shorty. \"Do everything with him. Take him into camp first. Hire him out to the Quartermaster. Let him wait on the Captain. Take him back home with you to help on the farm while Si\u0027s away. Jehosephat, a big buck like that\u0027s a mighty handy thing to have about the house. You kin learn him more tricks in a week than he\u0027d learn with his owner in a lifetime. Say, boy, what\u0027s your name?\" \"S s-s,\" the negro began to say, but he caught the Deacon\u0027s eye upon him, and responded promptly, \"Abr\u0027m Lincoln.\" \"I believe the nigger kin be taught,\" thought the Deacon. \"Probably this\u0027s some more o\u0027 Providence\u0027s workin\u0027s. Mebbe He brung this about jest to give me my share o\u0027 the work o\u0027 raisin\u0027 the fallen race.\" \"Boys,\" said he, \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve got something good to eat there. Them chickens seem tol\u0027ble young and fat. I hope you came by \u0027em honestly.\" \"Well, Pap,\" chuckled Si, \"I don\u0027t know as a man who\u0027s been runnin\u0027 around for another man\u0027s nigger, and got him, is jest in shape to ask questions how other men got chickens and things; but I\u0027ll relieve your mind by sayin\u0027 that we came honestly by \u0027em.\" \"Yes; thought it would be interestin\u0027 to try that way once, for a change,\" said Shorty. \"Besides, it wuz too near camp for any hornswogglin\u0027. These fellers right around camp are gettin\u0027 on to the names258 o\u0027 the regiments. They\u0027re learnin\u0027 to notice 200th Ind. on our caps, and\u0027 foller you right into camp, and go up to the Colonel. We\u0027re layin\u0027 altogether too long in one place. The Army o\u0027 the Cumberland oughter move.\" \"We paid full value, C. O. D.,\" added Si, \"and not in Drake\u0027s Plantation Bitters labels nor in busted Kalamazoo bank notes, neither. I think fellers that pass patent-medicine labels and business-college advertisements on these folks for money, oughter to be tied up by the thumbs. It\u0027s mean.\" \"That\u0027s what I say, too,\" added Shorty, with virtuous indignation. \"\u0027Specially when you kin git the best kind o\u0027 Confederit money from Cincinnati for two cents on the dollar. I always lay in enough o\u0027 that to do my tradin\u0027 with.\" \"What\u0027s that? What\u0027s that?\" gasped the Deacon. \"Passin\u0027 Confederate money that you buy in Cincinnati at two cents on the dollar? Why, that\u0027s counterfeitin\u0027.\" \"That\u0027s drawin\u0027 it a little too fine,\" said Shorty argumentatively. \"These flabbergasted fools won\u0027t take greenbacks. I offered the woman to-day some, and she said she wouldn\u0027t be found dead with \u0027em. She wanted Confedrit money. You may call it counterfeitin\u0027, but the whole Southern Confederacy is counterfeit, from its President down to the lowest Corporil. A dollar or two more or less won\u0027t make no difference. This feller at Cincinnati has got just as much right to print notes as they have in Richmond.\" \"He prints \u0027em on better paper, his pictures are better, and he sells his notes much cheaper, and I259 don\u0027t see why I shouldn\u0027t buy o\u0027 him rather than o\u0027 them. I believe in patronizin\u0027 home industry.\" \"Si,\" said his father, in horrified tones, \"I hope you hain\u0027t bin passin\u0027 none o\u0027 the Cincinnati Confederate money on these people.\" \"I hope not, Pap. But then, you know, I ain\u0027t no bank-note detector. I can\u0027t tell the Cincinnati kind from the Richmond kind, and I never try very hard. All Confedrt money\u0027s alike to me, and I guess in the end it\u0027ll be to them. Both kinds say they\u0027ll be paid six months after the conclusion of peace be twixt the Confederate States and the United States, and I guess one stands jest as good show as the other. The woman asked me $2 apiece for these chickens, and I paid her in the Confedrit money I happened to have in my pocket. I didn\u0027t notice whether it wuz printed in Cincinnati or Richmond. I got it from one o\u0027 the boys playin\u0027 p——. I mean he paid it to see me.\" He gave Shorty a furtive kick and whispered: \"Come mighty nigh givin\u0027 my self away that time.\" There was a long hill just before they came in sight of the entrance to the camp, and they got out and helped the mules up. They walked on ahead until they came to the top. The Deacon looked at the entrance, and said: \"I declare, if there isn\u0027t that owner o\u0027 this nigger waitin\u0027 for us.\" \"That so?\" said Si, turning his eyes in that direction. \"And he\u0027s got some officers with him. There\u0027s some officers jest mean enough to help these rebels ketch their niggers. I\u0027d like to knock their addled heads off.\"260 \"Jest wait till we git discharged, Si, and then we kin lick \u0027em as much as we want to,\" said Shorty. \"But we\u0027ve got to do somethin\u0027 now. They can\u0027t see us yit. Deacon, jest take yer nigger and cut down around through the crick there until you come to the picket-line. Then wait. Me and Si\u0027ll go on in, and come around and find you.\" \"All right,\" assented the Deacon, who was falling into camp ways with remarkable facility. \"But you\u0027ve got to look out for that teamster. He\u0027s meaner\u0027n dog-fennel. He\u0027ll tell everything.\" \"Good point,\" said Si. \"We must \u0027tend to him. See here, Groundhog,\" he continued, walking back to the teamster; \"you don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 about that old man and nigger that got on your wagon. They slipped off into the woods when you wuzn\u0027t lookin\u0027, while you wuz busy with your mules, and you don\u0027t know whether they went to the right or to the left, up the road or down it.\" \"Do you s\u0027pose I\u0027m goin\u0027 to help steal a nigger, and then lie about it to the officers, for you galoots, and all for nothin\u0027?\" said the teamster. \"You are blamed fools, that\u0027s all I\u0027ve got to say.\" \"Look here, Groundhog,\" said Shorty, coming up close, with a portentious doubled fist. \"You know me, and you know Si. You know that either of us can maul the head off you in a minute, whenever we\u0027ve a mind to, and we\u0027re likely any time to have a mind to. We\u0027re a durned sight nearer you all the time than any o\u0027 the officers, and you can\u0027t git away from us, though you may from them. They may buck and gag you, as they ought to, \u0027bout every day, but that won\u0027t be nothin\u0027 to the welting one of us \u0027ll261 give you. Now, you tell that story, jest as Si said, and stick to it, or you won\u0027t have a whole bone in your carcass by the end o\u0027 the week.\" When they came up to the entrance there indeed stood the owner of Abraham Lincoln, holding his horse, and by him stood the Lieutenant-Colonel of the 200th Ind., a big, burly man, who had been a drover and an influential politician before he got his commission, and had a high reputation at home as a rough-and-tumble fighter. He had not added to his bellicose fame since entering the field, because for some mysterious reason he had been absent every time the regiment went into a fight, or was likely to. Consequently he was all the more blustering and domineering in camp, in spite of the frequent repressions he got from the modest, quiet little Colonel. \"Old Blowhard Billings is there,\" said Si. \"Now we\u0027ll have a gust o\u0027 wind.\" \"Didn\u0027t know he was in camp,\" said Shorty. \"I\u0027ve a notion to bust a cap and scare him back to Nashville agin. Don\u0027t let him bluff you, Si, even if he is the Lieutenant-Colonel.\" They rode up to the entrance looking as innocent and placid as if bringing in a load from the fields on the Wabash. \"Corporal Klegg,\" said the Lieutenant-Colonel sternly, \"bring out that nigger from the wagon.\" \"We ain\u0027t got no nigger in the wagon, Colonel,\" said Si, with an expression of surprise. \"Come, now, don\u0027t fool with me, sir, or I\u0027ll make you very sorry for it. I\u0027m no man to be trifled with, sir. If you ain\u0027t got a nigger in the wagon, what \u0027ve you done with him.\"262 \"We ain\u0027t done nothin\u0027 with him, Colonel,\" persisted Si. \"I hain\u0027t had nothin\u0027 to do with no nigger since we started out this mornin\u0027; hain\u0027t spoken to one. Sometimes niggers jump on our wagons, ride a little ways, and then jump off agin. I can\u0027t keep track of \u0027em. I generally make \u0027em git off when I notice \u0027em.\" \"Corporal Klegg, you\u0027re lyin\u0027 to me,\" said the Lieutenant-Colonel roughly. \"I\u0027ll settle with you directly. Groundhog, have you got a nigger in the wagon?\" \"No, sir,\" replied the teamster. \"Didn\u0027t you have\u0027 one?\" Groundhog looked up and caught Shorty\u0027s eye fixed unflinchingly on him. \"I b\u0027lieve that one did git on,\" he stammered, \"but he got off agin d\u0027rectly. I didn\u0027t notice much about him. My mules wuz very bothersome all the time. They\u0027re the durndest meanest mules that ever a man tried to drive. That there off-swing mule\u0027d—\" \"We don\u0027t want to hear nothin\u0027 about your mules. We\u0027ll look in the wagon ourselves.\" The search developed nothing. The Lieutenant-Colonel came back to Si, angrier than ever. \"Look here, Klegg, you\u0027re foolin\u0027 me, an\u0027 I won\u0027t stand it. I\u0027ll have the truth out o\u0027 you if I have to kill you. Understand?\" There was a dangerous gleam in Si\u0027s and Shorty\u0027s eyes, but they kept their lips tightly closed. \"This gentleman here,\" continued the Lieutenant-Colonel, \"says, and I believe his story, against all that you may say, that the men with this wagon, which he\u0027s bin watchin\u0027 all along, took his nigger263 away from him and drove him off with insults and curses. They threatened his life. He says he can\u0027t reckonize either of you, and likely you have disguised yourselves. But he reckonizes the wagon and the teamster, and is willin\u0027 to swear to \u0027em. I know he\u0027s tellin\u0027 the truth, because I know you fellers. You\u0027re impudent and sassy. You\u0027ve bin among them that\u0027s hollered at me. You\u0027ve bin stealin\u0027 other things besides niggers to-day, and have \u0027em in your possession. You\u0027re loaded down with things you\u0027ve stolen from houses. I won\u0027t command a regiment of nigger-thieves. I won\u0027t have nigger-thieves in my regiment. If I\u0027ve got any in my regiment I\u0027ll break \u0027em of it, or I\u0027ll break their infernal necks. I believe you fellers got away with that nigger, and I\u0027ll tie you up by the thumbs till I get the truth out o\u0027 you. Sergeant o\u0027 the guard, take charge o\u0027 these men, and bring \u0027em along. Take that stuff that they\u0027ve stolen away from them and send it to my tent.\" Si and Shorty got very white about the mouth, but Si merely said, as they handed their guns to the guard: \"Colonel, you may tie us up till doomsday, but you\u0027ll git no help out of us to ketch runaway niggers and put \u0027em back in slavery.\" \"Shut up, you scalawag,\" roared the Lieutenant-Colonel. \"If I hear another word out o\u0027 you I\u0027ll buck-and-gag you.\" They marched to Regimental Headquarters and halted, and the Lieutenant-Colonel renewed his browbeating, Si and Shorty continued obstinate, and the Lieutenant-Colonel, getting angrier every minute,264 ordered them tied up by the thumbs. While the Sergeant of the Guard, who was a friend of the boys, and had little heart for the work, was dallying with his preparations, the Colonel himself appeared on the scene. \"Ah, Colonel, you\u0027ve got back, have you?\" said the Lieutenant-Colonel, little pleased at the interruption. \"I\u0027ve just caught two of the men in a little job o\u0027 nigger-stealin\u0027, and I was about to learn them265 a lesson which will break them of the habit. With your consent I\u0027ll go on with the work.\" \"Nigger-stealing?\" said the Colonel quietly. \"You mean helping a slave to get away? Did you learn whether the owner was a loyal man?\" \"I don\u0027t know as that makes any difference,\" replied \u0027the Lieutenant-Colonel surlily. \"As a matter of fact, I believe he said he had two sons in the rebel army.\" \u0027i\u0027ll Invite Your Attention to the Emancipation Proclamation 264 \u0027 \"Well, Colonel,\" said the other, \"I\u0027ll invite your attention to the Emancipation Proclamation of President Lincoln, and the orders from the War Department, which prohibit the return of slaves to disloyal owners, and make it the duty of officers and men to assist in their escape. You had better dismiss the men to their quarters.\" \"If that\u0027s the case if I don\u0027t resign. I\u0027m no \"Abolitionist. I didn\u0027t come into the army to free the niggers.\" \"I shall take pleasure in forwarding your resignation with a recommendation of its acceptance for the good of the service,\" said the Colonel calmly. \"Men, go to your quarters.\" \"Altogether, Pap, I consider this a mighty good day\u0027s work,\" remarked Si that evening after supper, as they sat around the fire smoking, with Abraham Lincoln snoring vigorously on the floor, in his first night\u0027s sleep as a free man.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63232.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
