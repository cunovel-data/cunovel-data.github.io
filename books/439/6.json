{"id":45041,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER V. FAT PORK—INDISPENSABLE BODY TIMBER FOR PATRIOTISM.","content":"IT WAS told in the last chapter how the patriotic impulses of Si Klegg, of the 200th Ind., reached his stomach and digestive apparatus, and brought them under obedient subjection to hardtack. He didn\u0027t have quite so rough an experience with that other staple of army diet, which was in fact the very counterpart of the hardtack, and which took its most popular name from that part of the body of the female swine which is usually nearest the ground. Much of Si\u0027s muscle and brawn was due to the fact that meat was always plenty on his father\u0027s farm. When Si enlisted he was not entirely free from anxiety on the question of meat, for to his appetite it was not even second in importance to bread. If bread was the \"staff of life\" meat was life itself to Si. It didn\u0027t make much difference to him what kind it was, only so it was meat. He didn\u0027t suppose Uncle Sam would keep him supplied with quail on toast and porterhouse steaks all the time, but he did hope he would give him as much as he wanted of something in that line. \"You won\u0027t get much pork, unless you\u0027re a good forager,\" said one of Si\u0027s friends he met at Louisville, and who had been a year in the service. Si thought he might, with practice and a little encouragement, be fairly successful in foraging on his\u0027 own hook, but at the same time he said he wouldn\u0027t grumble if he could only get plenty of pork. Fortunately for him he had not been imbued with the teachings of the Hebraic dispensation which declared \"unclean\" the beast that furnished the great bulk of the animal food for the American defenders of the union. Co. Q of the 200th Ind. received with the first issue of army rations at Louisville a bountiful supply of bacon of prime quality, and Si was happy at the prospect. He thought it would always be that way. \"I don\u0027t see anything the matter with such grub as that!\" said Si. \"Looks to me as though we were goin\u0027 to live like fighting-cocks.\" \"You\u0027re just a little bit brash,\" said his veteran friend, who had just been through the long, hungry march from Huntsville, Ala., to Louisville. \"Better eat all you can lay yer hands on now, while ye\u0027ve got a chance. One o\u0027 these days ye\u0027ll git into a tight place and ye won\u0027t see enough hog\u0027s meat in a week to grease a griddle. I\u0027ve bin there, myself! Jest look at me and see what short rations \u0027ll bring you to?\" But Si thought he wouldn\u0027t try to cross a bridge till he got to it, nor lie awake nights worrying over troubles that were yet in the future. Si had a philosophical streak in his mental make-up and this, by the way, was a good thing for a soldier to have. \"Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,\" was an excellent rule for him to go by. So Si assimilated all the pork that fell to his share, with an extra bit now and then from a comrade whose appetite was less vigorous. He thrived under its fructifying influence, and gave good promise of military activity and usefulness. No scientific processes of cookery were necessary to prepare it for immediate use. A simple boiling or frying or toasting was all that was required. The Veteran Talks to si 049 During the few days at Louisville fresh beef was issued occasionally. It is true that the animals slain for the soldiers were not always fat and tender, nor did each of them have four hind-quarters. This last fact was the direct cause of a good deal of inflammation in the 200th Ind., as in every other regiment. The boys who got sections of the forward part of the \"critter,\" usually about three-quarters bone, invariably kicked, and fired peppery remarks at those who got the juicy steaks from the rear portion of the animal. Then when their turn came for a piece of hind-quarter the other fellows would growl. Four-fifths of the boys generally had to content themselves with a skinny rib or a soupshank. Si shared the common lot, and did his full quota of grumbling because his \"turn\" for a slice of steak didn\u0027t come every time beef was issued. The pickled pork was comparatively free from this cause of irritation. It was all alike, and was simply \"Hobson\u0027s choice.\" Si remembered the fragrant and delicious fried ham that so often garnished his mother\u0027s breakfast table and wondered why there was not the same proportion of hams and sides in the Commissary that he remembered in the meathouse on the Wabash. He remarked to Shorty one day: \"I wonder where all this pork comes from?\" \"It comes from Illinoy, I suppose,\" said Shorty. \"I notice the barrels are all marked \u0027Chicago\u0027.\" \"Must grow funny kind o\u0027 hogs out there—a mile long each, I should say. What do you mean?\" \"Why, we\u0027ve drawn a full mile o\u0027 sides from the Commissary, and haint struck a ham yit. I\u0027m wonderin\u0027 jest how long that hog is!\" \"Well, you are green. You oughter know by this time that there are only enough hams for the officers.\" Now and then a few pigs\u0027 shoulders were handed round among the boys, but the large proportion of bone they contained was exasperating, and was the cause of much profanity. Sometimes bacon was issued that had really outlived its usefulness, except, perhaps, for the manufacture of soap. Improperly \"cured,\" it was strong and rancid, or, occasionally, so near a condition of putrefaction that the stench from it offended the nostrils of the whole camp. Some times it was full of \"skippers,\" that tunneled their way through and through it, and grew fat with riotous living. Drawing Rations 051 Si drew the line at this point. He had an ironplated stomach, but putrid and maggoty meat was too much for it. Whenever he got any of this he would trade it off to the darkies for chickens. There is nothing like pork for a Southern negro. He wants something that will \"stick to his ribs.\" By a gradual process of development his appetite reached the point when he could eat his fat pork perfectly raw. During a brief halt when on the march he would squat in a fence corner, go down into his haversack for supplies, cut a slice of bacon, lay it on a hardtack, and munch them with a keen relish. \u0027all Right, Boss; Dats a Go\u0027 052 At one of the meetings of the Army of the Cumberland Gen. Garfield told a story which may appropriately close this chapter. One day, while the Army of the Cumberland was beleaguered in Chattanooga and the men were almost starving on quarter rations, Gen. Rosecrans and his staff rode out to inspect the lines. As the brilliant cavalcade dashed by a lank, grizzled soldier growled to a comrade: \"It\u0027d be a darned sight better for this army if we had a little more sowbelly and not quite so many brass buttons!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63193.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
