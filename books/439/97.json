{"id":45132,"no":97,"title":"CHAPTER X. SHORTY AS ORDERLY","content":"HAS A TOUR OF DUTY AT THE GENERAL\u0027S HEADQUARTERS. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"WELL,\" said the General, after he had listened to Shorty\u0027s story, and questioned him a little, \"you are all right now. I\u0027ll take care of you. The Surgeon says that you are not fit to go back to the front, and will not be for some time. They have got more sick and convalescents down there now than they can take good care of. The army\u0027s gone into Winter quarters, and will probably stay there until Spring opens, so that they don\u0027t need either of us. I\u0027ll detail you as Orderly at these Headquarters, and you can go back with me when I do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I s\u0027pose that\u0027s all right and satisfactory,\" said Shorty, saluting. \"It\u0027s got to be, anyway. In the army a man with a star on his shoulder\u0027s got the last say, and kin move the previous question whenever he wants to. I never had no hankerin\u0027 for a job around Headquarters, and now that I\u0027m a Korpril I ought to be with my company. But they need you worse\u0027n they do me, and I\u0027ve noticed that you was always as near the front as anybody, so I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll lose no chances by stayin\u0027 with you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I promise you that we shall both go as soon as there\u0027s any prospect of something worth going for,\" said the General, smiling. \"Report there to Wilson. He will instruct you as to your duties.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Wilson\u0027s first instructions were as to Shorty\u0027s personal appearance. He must get a clean shave and a hair-cut, a necktie, box of paper collars, a pair of white gloves, have blouse neatly brushed and buttoned to his throat and his shoes polished. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dress parade every day?\" asked Shorty, despairingly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just the same as dress parade every day,\" answered the Chief Clerk. \"Don\u0027t want any scarecrows around these Headquarters. We\u0027re on dress parade all the time before the people and other soldiers, and must show them how soldiers ought to appear. You\u0027ll find a barber-shop and a bootblack around the corner. Make for them at once, and get yourself in shape to represent Headquarters properly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t know but I\u0027d ruther go to the front and dig rifle-pits than to wear paper collars and white gloves every day in the week,\" soliloquized Shorty, as he walked out on the street. \"Don\u0027t mind \u0027em on Sunday, when you kin take \u0027em off agin when the company\u0027s dismissed from parade; but to put \u0027em on in the mornin\u0027 when you git up, and wear \u0027em till you go to bed at night—O, Jehosephat! Don\u0027t think I\u0027ve got the constitution to stand that sort o\u0027 thing. But it\u0027s orders, and I\u0027ll do it, even if it gives me softenin\u0027 o\u0027 the brain. Here, you—(beckoning to a bootblack), put a 250-pounder Monitor coat o\u0027 polish on them Tennessee River gunboats. Fall in promptly, now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The little darky gave an estimating glance at the capacious cowhides, which had not had a touch of the brush since being drawn from the Quarter master, and then yelled to a companion on the other side of the street: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hey, Taters, come lend me a spit. I\u0027se got a\u0027 army contrack.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Vhat golor off a gravat do you vant?\" asked the Jewish vender of haberdashery, who was rapidly amassing a fortune from the soldiers. \"Dere\u0027s plack, red, kreen, plue—all lofely golors, unt de vinest kint off silk. Yoost de same as Cheneral Krant vears. He puys lods off me. Von\u0027t puy off nopody else vhen he gan ket to me. Now, dere\u0027s vun dat\u0027ll yoost suit your light gomplexion. You gan vear dat on St. Batrick\u0027s day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And he picked out one of bright green that would have made Shorty\u0027s throat seem in wild revolt against his hair. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I don\u0027t know,\" said Shorty meditatively, pulling over the lot. Then a thought struck him. Taking out the bit of Maria\u0027s dress, he said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Give me something as near as possible the color of that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Veil, I\u0027ve kot rid off datt off-golored negdie, dat I fought I nefer vould sell,\" meditated the Jew, as Shorty left. \"I\u0027m ahet yoost a tollar-unt-a-haluf on aggount off dat vild Irishman\u0027s kirl. Veil, de kirls ket some fellers into sgrapes, unt helps udders oud.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With this philosophical observation the Jew resumed his pleasant work of marking up his prices to better accord with his enlarged views as to the profits he could get off the soldiers. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Shorty returned to Headquarters, neatly shaven and brushed, and took the position of a soldier before the Chief Clerk, that functionary remarked approvingly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very good, very good, indeed. You\u0027ll be an ornament to Headquarters.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And the General, entering the room at that time, added: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, you are as fine a looking soldier as one would wish to see, and an examaple to others. But you have not your Corporal\u0027s chevrons on. Allow me to present you with a pair. It gives me pleasure, for you have well earned them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Stepping back into his office he returned with the chevrons in his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There, find a tailor outside somewhere to sew them on. You are now a non-commissioned officer on my staff, and I expect you to do all you can to maintain its character and dignity.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty\u0027s face flushed with pride as he saluted, and thought, without saying: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You jest bet I will. Any loafer that don\u0027t pay proper respect to this here staff\u0027ll git his blamed neck broke.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here,\" said the Chief Clerk, handing Shorty an official envelope, when the latter returned from having his chevrons sewed on. \"Take this down to Col. Billings. Mind you do it in proper style. Don\u0027t get to sassing old Billings. Stick the envelope in your belt, walk into the office, take the position of a soldier, salute, and hand him the envelope, saying, \u0027With the compliments of the General,\u0027 salute again, about-face, and walk out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll want to punch his rotten old head off the minute I set eyes on him,\" remarked Shorty, sotto voce; \"but the character and dignity of the staff must be maintained.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Lieut.-Col. Billings started, and his face flushed, when he saw Shorty stalk in, severely erect and soldierly. Billings was too little of a soldier to comprehend the situation. His first thought was that Shorty, having been taken under the General\u0027s wing, had come back to triumph over him, and he prepared himself with a volley of abuse to meet that of his visitor. But Shorty, with stern eyes straight to the front, marched up to him, saluted in one-two-three time, drew the envelope from his belt, and thrusting it at him as he would his gun to the inspecting officer on parade, announced in curtly official tones, \"With General\u0027s compliments, sir,\" saluted again, about-faced as if touched with a spring, and marched stiffly toward the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n Billings hurriedly glanced at the papers, and saw that instead of some unpleasant order from the General, which he had feared, they were merely some routine matters. His bullying instinct at once reasserted itself: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Puttin\u0027 on a lot o\u0027 scollops, since, just because you\u0027re detailed at Headquarters,\" he called out after Shorty. \"More style than a blue-ribbon horse at a county fair, just because the General took a little notice of you. But you\u0027ll not last long. I know you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sir,\" said Shorty, facing about and stiffly saluting, \"if you\u0027ve got any message for the General, I\u0027ll deliver it. If you hain\u0027t, keep your head shet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, go on; go on, now, you two-for-a-cent Corporal. Don\u0027t you give me any more o\u0027 your slack, or I\u0027ll report you for your impudence, and have them stripes jerked offen you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027what Do You Think of That?\u0027 Said the Gambler. 141 \\n\\n \\n\\n Hot words sprang to Shorty\u0027s lips, but he remembered the General\u0027s injunction about the character and dignity of the staff, and restrained himself to merely saying: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Col. Billings, some day I won\u0027t belong to the staff, and you won\u0027t have no shoulder-straps. Then I\u0027ll invite you to a little discussion, without no moderator in the chair.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go on, now. Don\u0027t you dare threaten me,\" shouted Billings. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How\u0027d you get along with Billings?\" inquired the Chief Clerk, when Shorty returned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"About as well as the monkey and the parrot did,\" answered Shorty, and he described the interview, ending with: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I never saw a man who was achin\u0027 for a good lickin\u0027 like that old bluffer. And he\u0027ll git it jest as soon as he\u0027s out o\u0027 the service, if I have to walk a hundred miles to give it to him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ll have to wait a good while,\" answered Wilson. \"He\u0027ll stay in the service as long as he can keep a good soft berth like this. He\u0027s now bombarding everybody that\u0027s got any influence with telegrams to use it to keep him here in the public interest. He claims that on account of his familiarity with things here he is much more valuable to the Government here than he would be in the field.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No doubt o\u0027 that,\" said Shorty. \"He ain\u0027t worth a groan in the infernal regions at the front. He only takes the place and eats the rations of some man that might be of value.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"See here,\" said Wilson, pointing to a pile of letters and telegrams on his desk. \"These are protests against Billings being superseded and sent away. More are coming in all the time. They are worrying the General like everything, for he wants to do the right thing. But I know that they all come from a ring of fellows around here who sell whisky and slop-shop goods to the soldiers, and skin them alive, and are protected by Billings. They\u0027re whacking up with him, and they want him to stay. I\u0027m sure of it, but I haven\u0027t any proof, and there\u0027s no use saying anything to the General unless I\u0027ve got the proof to back it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wonder if I couldn\u0027t help git the proof,\" suggested Shorty, with his sleuth instincts reviving. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just the man,\" said the Chief Clerk eagerly, \"if you go about it right. You\u0027re a stranger here, and scarcely anybody knows that you belong to Headquarters. Get yourself back in the shape you were this morning, and go out and try your luck. It\u0027ll just be bully if we can down this old blowhard.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty took off his belt and white gloves, unbuttoned his blouse, and lounged down the street to the quarter where the soldiers most congregated to be fleeced by the harpies gathered there as the best place to catch men going to or returning from the front. Shorty soon recognized running evil-looking shops, various kinds of games and drinking dens several men who had infested the camps about Nashville and Murfreesboro until the Provost-Marshal had driven them away. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Billings has gathered all his old friends about him,\" said he to himself. \"I guess I\u0027ll find somebody here that I kin use.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hello, Injianny; what are you doin\u0027 here?\" inquired a man in civilian clothes, but unmistakably a gambler. \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty remembered him at once as the man with whom he had had the adventure with the loaded dice at Murfreesboro. With the fraternity of the class, neither remembered that little misadventure against the other. They had matched their wits for a wrestle, and when the grapple was over it was over. \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty therefore replied pleasantly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, jest loafin\u0027 back here, gittin\u0027 well o\u0027 a crack on the head and the camp fever.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Into anything to put in the time?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Naah,\" said Shorty weariedly. \"Nearly dead for something. Awful stoopid layin\u0027 around up there among them hayseeds, doin\u0027 nothin\u0027. Jest run down to Jeffersonville to see if I couldn\u0027t strike something that\u0027d some life in it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I kin let you into a good thing. I\u0027ve bin runnin\u0027 that shebang over there, with another man, and doin\u0027 well, but he let his temper git away with him, and shpped a knife into a sucker, and they\u0027ve got him in jail, where he\u0027ll stay awhile. I must have another partner. Got any money?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A hundred or so,\" answered Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s enough. I don\u0027t want money so much as the right kind of a man. Put up your stuff, and I\u0027ll let you in cahoots with me, and we\u0027ll make a bar\u0027l o\u0027 money out o\u0027 these new troops that\u0027ll begin coming down this week.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I like the idee. But how do you know you kin run your game. This Provost-Marshall—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, the Provost\u0027s all right. He\u0027s an old friend o\u0027 mine. I have him dead to rights. Only whack up fair with him, and you\u0027re all right. Only pinches them that want to hog on him and won\u0027t share. I\u0027ve bin runnin\u0027 right along here for weeks, and \u0027ve had no trouble. I give up my little divvy whenever he asks for it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If I was only certain o\u0027 that,\" said Shorty meditatively, \"I\u0027d—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certain? Come right over here to that ranch, and have a drink, and I\u0027ll show you, so\u0027s you can\u0027t be mistaken. I tell you, I\u0027m solid as a rock with him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When seated at a quiet table, with their glasses in front of them, the gambler pulled some papers from his breast pocket, and selecting one shoved it at Shorty with the inquiry: \"There, what do you think o\u0027 that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty read over laboriously: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Deer Bat: Send me 50 please. I set behind two small pair \\n\\n last night, while the other feller had a full, \u0026 Ime strapt \\n\\n this morning. Yores, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Billings.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That seems convincing,\" said Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then look at this,\" said the gambler, producing another paper. It read: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Deer Bat: Got yore $100 all right, but doant send by that \\n\\n man again. He\u0027s shaky, and talks too much. Bring it \\n\\n yourself, or put it in an envelope directed to me, \u0026 drop it \\n\\n in my box. Yores, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Billings.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s enough,\" said Shorty, with his mind in a tumult, as to how he was to get these papers into his possession. \"I\u0027ll go in with you, if you\u0027ll take me. Here\u0027s my fist.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He reached out and shook hands with Bat Meacham over the bargain, and called to the waiter, \"Here, fill \u0027em up agin.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty pulled some papers out of his pocket to search for his money, and fumbled them over. There were two pieces among them resembling the scraps on which Billings had written his notes. They contained some army doggerel which the poet of Co. Q had written and Shorty was carrying about as literary treasures. \\n\\n \\n\\n The waiter wiped off the table as he replaced the glasses, and Shorty lifted up the gambler\u0027s papers to permit him to do so. He laid down his own papers instead, and with them a $10 bill. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There,\" he said; \"I find that\u0027s all the money I have with me, but it\u0027s enough to bind the bargain. I left a couple hundred with the clerk at the tavern. I\u0027ll go right up and git it, and we\u0027ll settle the thing right here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very good,\" replied Bat Meacham; \"git back as quick as you kin. You\u0027ll find me either here or hangin\u0027 around near. Let\u0027s fix the thing up and git ready. I think a new regiment\u0027ll be down here tomorrow, and all the men\u0027ll have their first installment o\u0027 bounty and a month\u0027s pay.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty hurried back to Headquarters and laid his precious papers before the Chief Clerk, who could not contain his exultation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Won\u0027t there be a tornado when the General sees these in the morning,\" he exclaimed. \"He\u0027s gone out to camp, now, or I\u0027d take them right to him. But he shall have them first thing in the morning.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The next morning Shorty waited with eager impatience while the General was closeted with his Chief Clerk. Presently the General stepped to the door and said sternly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Corporal.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" said Shorty, springing to his feet and saluting. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go down at once to the Provost-Marshal\u0027s office and tell Col. Billings to come to Headquarters at once. To come at once, without a moment\u0027s delay.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" said Shorty saluting, with a furtive wink at the Chief Clerk, which said as plainly as words, \"No presenting compliments this time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He found Billings, all unconscious of the impending storm, dealing out wrath on those who were hauled before him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Col. Billings,\" said Shorty, standing stiff as a ramrod and curtly saluting, \"the General wants you to come to Headquarters at once.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well,\" replied Billings; \"report to the General that I\u0027ll come as soon as I dispose of this business.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027ll not do,\" said Shorty with stern imperiousness. \"The General orders (with a gloating emphasis on \u0027orders\u0027) you to drop everything else, and come instantly. You\u0027re to go right back with me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty enjoyed the manifest consternation in Billings\u0027s face as he heard this summons. The men of the office pricked up their ears, and looked meaningly at one another. Shorty saw it all, and stood as straight and stern as if about to lead Billings to execution. \\n\\n \\n\\n Billings, with scowling face, picked up his hat, buttoned his coat, and walked out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you know what the General wants with me. Shorty?\" he asked in a conciliatory way, when they were alone together on the sidewalk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My name\u0027s Corporal Elliott. You will address me as such,\" answered Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go to the devil,\" said Billings. \\n\\n \\n\\n Billings tried to assume a cheerfully-genial air as he entered the General\u0027s office, but the grin faded at the sight of the General\u0027s stern countenance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Col. Billings,\" said the General, handing him the two pieces of paper, \"do you recognize these?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can\u0027t say that I do,\" answered Billings, pretending to examine them while he could recover his wits sufficiently for a fine of defense. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t attempt to lie to me,\" said the General wrathfully, \"or I\u0027ll forget myself sufficiently to tear the straps from your disgraced shoulders. I have compared these with other specimens of your handwriting, until I have no doubt. I have sent for you not to hear your defense, or to listen to any words from you. I want you to merely sit down there and sign this resignation, and then get out of my office as quickly as you can. I don\u0027t want to breathe the same air with you. I ought to courtmartial you, and set you to hard work on the fortifications, but I hate the scandal. I have already telegraphed to Army Headquarters to accept your resignation by wire, and I shall send it by telegraph. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I cannot get you out of the army too quickly. Sign this, and leave my office, and take off your person every sign of your connection with the army. I shall give orders that if you appear on the street with so much as a military button on, it shall be torn off you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As the crushed Lieutenant-Colonel was leaving the office, Shorty lounged up, and said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"See here. Mister Billings—you\u0027re Mister Billings now, and a mighty ornery Mister, too, I\u0027m going to lay for you, and settle several little p\u0027ints with you. You\u0027ve bin breedin\u0027 a busted head, and I\u0027m detailed to give it to you. Git out, you hound.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63284.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
