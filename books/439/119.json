{"id":45154,"no":119,"title":"CHAPTER X. THE BOYS HAVE A COUPLE OF LITTLE SKIRMISHES","content":"\n BUT FINALLY GET TO THE MILL. \n \n THE time and the surroundings were such as to bring the spirits of the boys to their lowest ebb. \n \n The gloomy, mysterious woods seemed a world\u0027s distance away from their homes, friends and assistance. \n \n The long, tiresome tramp, the violent rainstorm, which had soaked them to their skins, and apparently found its way to their hearts; the muddy, slippery road, with torrents rushing across it, the splashing, searching rivulets from the boughs overhead, were all deeply depressing. \n \n The boys huddled together, as if to gain courage by closer contact. \n \n \"Gracious, I never supposed they\u0027d pull off a fight at night, when everybody was tired to death and soaked to a gruel,\" said Alf Russell in a shivery whisper. \n \n \"They fought at Hohenlinden at night, and on the snow,\" answered Monty Scruggs. \"But snow\u0027s not so bad as rain, and, then, they didn\u0027t have these awful woods. I\u0027d feel much better if we was out in a clearing somewhere.\" \n \n \"Come into line to the left, there,\" commanded Si, in a low tone. \"Deploy, one pace apart. Shorty, take the left out there in the bushes. Don\u0027t make no noise, step carefully, and don\u0027t shoot till I do.\" \n \n \"Keep near me, Pete, and you won\u0027t git lost,\" said Shorty, as he stepped off into the brush. \n \n —\"Must I shoot the same time you do, or wait till you shoot?\" asked Pete, who seemed less depressed by his surroundings than the others, and mainly eager to get a chance to shoot. \n \n \"Don\u0027t watch me,\" cautioned Shorty. \"Watch the fellers you are shootin\u0027 at, and try to hit \u0027em. Fire just as soon as you want to after you hear the others.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll bet I\u0027ll hit a rebel if anybody does,\" said Pete with hopeful animation. \n \n They tramped forward a few steps over the spongy ground, and through the dripping bushes. \n \n The musketry fire continued fitfully around the mill in the distance. \n \n They came to the summit of the little rise. \n \n \"Hist—halt; lay down, quick,\" called the watchful Si, in a penetrating voice. \"They\u0027ve loaded agin\u0027, and are about to shoot.\" \n \n He and Shorty were down on their faces as he spoke. The others obeyed more slowly and clumsily. The rebel volley cut the limbs and bushes over their heads, and whistled viciously through the damp air and the darkness. \n \n As little Pete dropped to the ground, his nervous finger touched the trigger and his gun went off up in the air. The others took this as a cue, and banged away as rapidly as they could get their muskets off. \n \n Only Si and Shorty, in dropping, had kept the lay of the ground in view, and without rising they deliberately aimed their pieces whither the volley had come and fired. A suppressed yell of pain came from the other side. \n \n \"We salted one of \u0027em, anyway,\" chuckled Shorty, as he raised on his knee to reload his gun. \n \n \"Gosh all Chrismus,\" said Si, using his most formidable swear-word, for he was very angry. \"What was you brats shootin\u0027 at? Squirrels or angels? A rebel\u0027d had to be 80 cubits high, like old Haman, for one o\u0027 you to\u0027ve hit him. Lots o\u0027 good o\u0027 your packin\u0027 around guns and cartridges, if you\u0027re goin\u0027 to waste your ammynition on the malaria in the clouds. Load agin, now, carefully, and when you shoot agin be sure to fetch something. I\u0027ll take my ramrod to the next boy that I ketch shootin\u0027 higher\u0027n a man\u0027s head. This ain\u0027t no Fourth-o\u0027-July business. Our job\u0027s te kill them whangdoodles over there, and I want you to \u0027tend strictly to that.\" \n \n The threat of a real boyish thrashing and the cool, matter-of-fact way that Si and Shorty conducted themselves—precisely as if chopping trees or mowing a field—steadied the boys wonderfully. \n \n \"They\u0027re about ready to shoot agin,\" Si spoke down the line, in a penetrating whisper. \"Everybody hug the ground, and watch the flashes. Each feller git a good line on the flash straight in front of him, and let the hound have a chunk o\u0027 lead just below his belt. If you\u0027re all real good, and shoot just right, I\u0027ll take you on a rush right at them fellers, and we\u0027ll scatter what\u0027s left like a flock o\u0027 quail. Lay low. There it comes agin. Lay low.\" \n \n An irregular volley burnt out in the blackness beyond. The bullets sang around much closer than before, and several of them struck near Si, one landing in the leaves and moss directly in front of him, and throwing a wet sprinkle in his face. \n \n \"Like the parrot, I was talkin\u0027 too much and too loud,\" thought Si. \"They wuz all reachin\u0027 for me, and one feller made a mighty good line shot. Le\u0027s see if I can\u0027t better him.\" \n \n He drew down in his sights as carefully as he could in the darkness, and pulled the trigger. As the smoke thinned out a little he thought he saw something beyond which indicated a man staggering and falling. \n \n This time the boys seemed to be firing effectively. There was a commotion in the woods beyond, and the sound of groans on the damp air. \n \n \"Raise up!\" shouted Si. \"Forward! Forward! Jump \u0027em. Jump \u0027em before they kin load agin!\" \n \n Loading his gun with the practiced ease of a veteran as he rushed forward, Si led his squad directly against the position of the rebels. Part of the rebels had promptly run away, as they heard Si order the charge, but part boldly stood their ground, and were nervously reloading, or fixing bayonets, as the squad came crashing through the brush. One of the rebels fired a hasty, ineffectual shot, and by its light Shorty saw the nervous little Pete, who had torn off his cumbering haversack, letting his hat go with it, slip between him and Si, and gain a pace in advance. \n \n \"Git back, you little rat,\" said Shorty, reaching out a long arm, catching the boy by the collar, and yanking him back. \"Git behind me and stay there.\" \n \n The flash revealed another rebel fumbling for a cap. Shorty\u0027s gun came down, and the rebel fell, shot through the shoulder. The rebel leader, a long haired, lathy man, with the quickness of a wildcat, sprang at Si with his bayonet fixed. Heavy-footed and deliberate as Si usually was, when the electricity of a fight was in him there was no lack of celerity. He caught the rebel\u0027s bayonet on his musket-barrel and warded it off so completely that the rebel shot by him in the impetus of his own rush. As he passed Si delivered a stunning blow on the back of his head with his gun-barrel. \n \n \"That zouave drill was a mighty good thing, after all,\" thought Si, as he turned from his prostrate foe to the others. \n \n While this was going on, the boys were imitating Shorty\u0027s example, getting their guns loaded, and banging away as fast as they did so into the rebels, who went down under the shots, or ran off, leaving one of their number, a tall, lank mountaineer, who seemed beside himself with rage. He had grasped his empty gun by the stock, and was swinging it around his head, yelling fierce insults and defiance to the whole race o\u0027 Yankees. \n \n \"Come on, you infernal pack o\u0027 white-livered, nigger-stealin\u0027, house-robbin\u0027, hell-desarvin\u0027 hypocrites,\" he shouted. \"I kin lick the hull bilin\u0027 o\u0027 yo\u0027uns. This is my wounded pardner here, and yo\u0027uns can\u0027t have neither me nor him till yo\u0027uns down me, which y\u0027 can\u0027t do. Come on, y\u0027 pigeon-livered cowards.\" \n \n The boys who had pressed lip near him, shrank back a little, out of possible range of that violently brandished musket, and began loading their guns. \n \n Shorty had stopped for an instant to turn over into an easier position the rebel he had shot. \n \n Si paced up. His gun was loaded, and he could have easily brought the rebel down. But the rebel\u0027s devotion to his partner touched him. \n \n Don\u0027t Anybody Shoot. 119 \n \n \"Don\u0027t shoot, boys,\" he commanded; \"leave me to \u0027tend to him. Say, Johnny,\" he addressed the rebel, in a placatory way, \"don\u0027t make a fool o\u0027 yourself. Come down, we\u0027ve got you, dead. drop that gun.\" \n \n \"Go to brimstone blazes,\" shouted the rebel. \"If yo\u0027uns have got me, why don\u0027t y\u0027 take me. I kin lick the hull caboodle o\u0027 y\u0027 sneakin\u0027 mulatters. Come on, why don\u0027t y\u0027?\" \n \n \"Give him a wad, Si,\" said Shorty, reloading his own gun. \"We haint no time to lose. They need us over there.\" \n \n \"No, don\u0027t anybody shoot,\" commanded Si; \"he\u0027s just crazy about his partner. He\u0027s too brave a man to kill. Say, Johnny, have a little sense. We haint goin\u0027 to hurt your partner, nor you, if you\u0027ll behave. drop that gun at once, and surrender.\" \n \n \"Go to blazes,\" retorted the rebel, swinging his gun more wildly than ever. \"Yo\u0027uns is all liars. No dependence kin be placed on y\u0027. If y\u0027 want me, come and git me.\"\u0027 \n \n Shorty had begun to think the thing somewhat humorous. \"Look here, Johnny,\" said he, \"wouldn\u0027t you like a big chaw o\u0027 navy terbacker—bright plug. Genuine Yankee plug? Swingin\u0027 that ere gun that way is awful tiresome.\" \n \n \"Eh—What\u0027s that?\" said the rebel, startled by the new proposition and its coolness. \n \n \"I say, don\u0027t you want a big chaw o\u0027 terbacker? You must need it. I always do after I\u0027ve bin workin\u0027 hard. drop your gun, and have one with me. We\u0027re Injiannians, and we don\u0027t mean no harm to your partner, nor to you. We\u0027ll take care o\u0027 him, if he\u0027s hurt. Here, cut your own chaw.\" \n \n \"Air yo\u0027uns from Injianny?\" said the rebel, bringing his gun down to a less menacing attitude. \"I\u0027ve done got two brothers in Injianny, and I hear they\u0027uns \u0027ve done inlisted in Yankee rijiments. Mebbe yo\u0027uns know \u0027em.\" \n \n \"Mebbe we do,\" said Shorty, handing him a long plug and his knife. \"But we hain\u0027t time to talk it over now. We\u0027ll do that in the mornin\u0027, when business ain\u0027t so pressin\u0027. Le\u0027 me hold your gun while you cut your terbacker.\" \n \n \"Now, look here,\" said Si, \"time\u0027s jumpin\u0027, and we must talk quick. If we parole you, will you stay here, and take care o\u0027 your partner and the others, and be here in the mornin\u0027, when we send for you?\" \n \n \"You won\u0027t send for me, if yo\u0027uns is a-gwine on ter fout we\u0027uns up at the mill. We\u0027uns chaw yo\u0027uns up, or run y\u0027 outen the country.\" \n \n \"We\u0027ll take care o\u0027 that,\" said Si sharply. \"Will you promise on your honor to stay with these men, and take care o\u0027 them till daylight, if we don\u0027t come sooner?\" \n \n \"Sartin,—\u0027pon honor,\" answered the rebel, with his mouth full of tobacco. \n \n \"All right, then. Load at will. Load! Forward!—March!\" commanded Si. \n \n Si moved on cautiously, for he feared that the runaways had told those attacking the mill about his advance, and would bring them all down upon him. The dying down of the firing about the mill confirmed this opinion. He warned his boys to make as little noise as possible, and went ahead of them some distance, to reconnoiter, slipping along the side of the road, under the shadow of the trees. He arranged a system of signals with Shorty, by which one click of his gunlock meant halt, and two to come ahead. Presently he came in sight of the broad race which ran to the mill. The starlight was sufficient to show its width and its banks, with the logs lying along, which had been cut when it was dug. A bridge crossed the race for the road to the mill. Beyond the ground rose sharply, and looking at the crest against the sky, he could see the rebels, one by one, file over, and come down to where they could crouch behind the logs and ambuscade the bridge. \n \n Si clicked his gunlock, and waited till he had counted 25 rebels gathered there, which seemed to be all, as no more appeared. Then he slipped back to Shorty, and hurriedly explained the situation. \n \n The boys listened with sinking hearts. More than three times as many rebels as they themselves numbered, and perhaps fiercer and stronger than those they had already encountered. \n \n The elation of their recent victory subsided. Again the woods became ominously dark and gloomy, the soaking dampness very depressing. They huddled together to brace each other up. \n \n \"Si,\" said Shorty, \"didn\u0027t you say that it was a squad o\u0027 the Maumee Muskrats in the mill, and that we wuz goin\u0027 to relieve \u0027em.\" \n \n \"Yes, and the Orderly said that railroad \u0027Mick\u0027—Hennessey—was the Sarjint in command.\" \n \n \"O, that bog-trottin\u0027 old section boss, that hairy-handed artist with the long shovel, is there, is he with his crucifix and his prayers to the Saints. That\u0027s all right. He\u0027s bin stormin\u0027 and swearin\u0027 ever since the fight begun; because he\u0027s bin obliged to stay inside and shoot, and instid of making a grand rush and settling things, according to Donnybrook Fair rules. I tell you what you do. You work the boys carefully down through the brush toward the race, and git \u0027em into position in easy range of the rebels, covering \u0027em behind logs. I\u0027ll take a circuit around to the left, and git over to the hill, behind the rebels, and near enough the mill for Hennessey to hear me. Then I\u0027ll fire a shot and yell for Hennessey. He knows my voice, and he\u0027ll bring his men out like a pack o\u0027 hornets. Then you let into the rebels from your side. They can\u0027t git across the race at you, and we\u0027ll have \u0027em where we kin whipsaw \u0027em.\" \n \n \"Shorty,\" said Si admiringly, \"Gen. Grant \u0027ll hear o\u0027 you some day, and then Co. Q will lose its brightest star, but the army\u0027ll gain a great General.\" \n \n \"I know it; I know it,\" said Shorty, modestly; \"but don\u0027t stop to talk about it now. I think I\u0027ve got the lay o\u0027 the mill in mind. I\u0027ll just cut around that way. Don\u0027t shoot till you hear me.\" \n \n Si quietly deployed his boys to the left of the road, and worked them through the brush until they came to the crest overlooking the mill-race. They took readily to this sort of work. They had all hunted rabbits over the hills of southern Indiana, and they came into position so softly that the rebels beyond did not suspect their presence. \n \n Then came a long wait for the signal from Shorty. The rebels seemed to get tired first. Presently they could be seen moving around, and Si had hard work restraining his squad from shooting at the tempting marks. Then the rebels began talking, at first in murmurs, and then louder. There seemed to be a division of opinion among them. Those who had been run back were sure that the Yankee were coming on to the relief of their comrades in the mill. The others thought that their comrades had run the other away just as fast. \n \n \"I tell you, hit\u0027s no use to wait for they\u0027uns no longer,\" said one strong voice. \"Them Yankees is runnin\u0027 back to their camps as fast as they\u0027uns\u0027s legs \u0027ll carry they\u0027uns. If yo\u0027uns \u0027d had any sand, and stood yer ground, you\u0027d \u0027a seed \u0027em. But yo\u0027 yaller hammers allers git the ager when ever a cap\u0027s busted, and run yer rabbit-gizzards out.\" \n \n \"Y\u0027re a liar,\" hotly responded another voice. \"Thar was more\u0027n 50 o\u0027 them Yankees, if thar was a man. We fit \u0027em awful, before we give away, and they\u0027d killed Burt Dolson and Bob Whittyker, and I don\u0027t know how many more. They come bulgin\u0027 right on toward the mill, arter they\u0027d reformed. I know hit, bekase Eph and me staid and watched \u0027em, and shot at \u0027em, till we thought hit best to run back and warn ye.\" \n \n \"Ye wuz in a powerful hurry to warn us,\" sneered the other. \"Well, thar\u0027s no Yankees over thar, and none haint a-comin\u0027 till daylight. I\u0027ve ketched all the ager and rhematiz here that I\u0027m a-gwine ter. Le\u0027s go back and salivate them fellers in the mill, and set fire to it.\" \n \n This seemed to be the prevailing sentiment, and Si began to fear that they would all go, and might intercept Shorty. He was on the point of ordering the boys to fire, and attract their attention, when Shorty\u0027s rifle rang out, and the next instant came a roar from Shorty\u0027s powerful lungs, with each word clear and distinct: \n \n \"Hennessy—you—red—mouthed—Mick—come out. The 200th Injianny is—here. Come out—with a rush—you—imported spalpeen—and jump—\u0027em—in—the—rear!\" \n \n \"Now, boys,\" commanded Si, \"keep cool, pick your man, and fire low. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to take the feller that\u0027s bin doin\u0027 the big talkin\u0027.\" \n \n Each of the boys had already picked his man, and was eagerly waiting the word. Their fire threw their enemies into confusion, and as their guns rattled, the barricaded doors of the mill were thrown open, and Hennessey rushed out with a wild Irish \"hurroo.\" The rebels incontinently fled, without an attempt at resistance. \n \n After it was ascertained that every unhurt rebel was running for dear life to get away, after Hennessey and his squad had gathered up the wounded and carried them into the mill, and after the boys had yelled themselves hoarse over their victory gained with such unexpected ease, they suddenly remembered that they were so tired that they could scarcely drag one foot after another, and hungrier than young wolves at the end of a hard Winter. \n \n \"Gewhillikins,\" murmured Jim Humphreys, \"I wonder when we\u0027re going to have supper. I\u0027m as holler as a stovepipe.\" \n \n \"You\u0027ve got your suppers in your haversacks,\" said Si. \"We\u0027ll go into the mill and build a fire and make some coffee and fry some meat.\" \n \n \"In my haversack,\" said Jim ruefully, after they had entered the mill, and he had run his hand into his forgotten haversack, and withdrawn it covered with a viscid greasy mush. \"My haversack\u0027s full o\u0027 water, that\u0027s soaked everything else in it to a gruel.\" \n \n \"So\u0027s mine; so\u0027s mine,\" echoed the rest, as they examined. \n \n \"Confound it,\" said Si\u0027 wrathfully, as he looked into one after another. \"Didn\u0027t none o\u0027 you have sense enough to fasten down the covers carefully, so\u0027s to keep the water out? Here it is—salt and sugar and coffee, bread and greasy pork all in one nasty mess. I declare, you don\u0027t seem to have the sense you wuz born with. You\u0027ve bin breakin\u0027 yourselves down luggin\u0027 around 10 or 15 pounds o\u0027 water, besides spilin\u0027 your rations.\" \n \n \"Probably Sarjint Hennessey has some rations that he kin give us,\" suggested Shorty, who was genuinely sorry for the poor boys. \n \n \"Dade I haint—not a smidgeon,\" answered Hennessey. \"We ixpicted ye\u0027s to git here this forenoon and relieve us, and we et up ivery spoonful of our grub for breakfast, so\u0027s to lighten us for a quick march back to camp. They\u0027ve not bin runnin\u0027 in the mill for several days, and\u0027ve carted off ivery bit of the male they ground. We\u0027re nigh starved oursilves, but we\u0027ve had a lovely little foight, and we forgive ye\u0027s for not coming airlier. Oi wouldn\u0027t \u0027ve missed that last rush on thim divil\u0027s for a month\u0027s double rations.\" \n \n \"Well,\" said Si, encouragingly, \"we\u0027ll have to make mine and Shorty\u0027s rations go around as well as they kin, among all of you. Fish the meat out o\u0027 your haversacks, boys, and wash the dope off it. It ain\u0027t spiled, anyway. We kin each of us have a little to eat tonight, and we\u0027ll trust to Providence for termorrer.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63306.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
