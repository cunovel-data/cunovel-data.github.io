{"id":45061,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER II. SECOND DAY\u0027S MARCH","content":"THE LONG COLUMN CRAWLS THROUGH RAIN AND COLD TO MURFREESBORO. SI KLEGG was generous with his rail, as he was with all things among his comrades. He selected the softest part, in the center, for him self and Shorty, and then invited the other boys to share its hospitalities. They crowded up close to him and Shorty on either side, and there seemed to come a little warmth and dryness from the close contact of their bodies. Si was so mortally tired that it seemed a great relief just to sit still and rest, though the rain continued to pour down. Shorty fished some hardtack and fried pork out of his haversack, and also gave him a handful of ground coffee. Si munched the crackers and meat, with an occasional nip at the coffee. His spirits began to rise just a trifle. He was too healthy in body and mind to be totally downcast for long. \"\u0027Tis n\u0027t much of a supper,\" he said to himself, \"but it beats nothin\u0027 at all miles and miles. Besides, I was mighty lucky in gettin\u0027 the biggest rail. Some that the other boys has are no good at all. They\u0027ll let \u0027em right down in the mud. And most o\u0027 the boys has no rails at all. I\u0027m awfully sorry for \u0027em.\" Then he began to wonder if they were not 27overcautious about the nearness of the enemy. He had been in the army just long enough to have contempt for the stories that were always current with a certain class about the proximity and strength of the enemy. Shorty was not of that kind; but, then, Shorty was as liable to be imposed upon as anybody. \"How do you know there\u0027s a rebel battery on the hill out there?\" he finally asked Shorty. \"They belted into the Oshkosh Terrors, out there to our right, killed a mule, scared two teamsters to death, and knocked over three or four kittles of coffee. It was awful unlucky about the coffee,\" an swered Shorty. \"How long ago was that?\" \"O, several hours ago. Just after we turned into the field, and long before you come up.\" \"Mebbe they\u0027ve gone off now. Mebbe, if they\u0027re there yet, their ammynition\u0027s so soaked that they can\u0027t shoot. What do you say to startin\u0027 a little fire? It\u0027d be an immense comfort. Unless we can dry out a little we\u0027ll be soaked into such mush before morning that we can\u0027t keep our shape, and they\u0027ll have to ladle us up with dippers.\" \"It\u0027s strictly against orders.\" \"You mean it was against orders several hours ago. I can\u0027t see nothin\u0027 on that hill over there. I\u0027ve been watchin\u0027 for half an hour. There\u0027s nothin\u0027 movin\u0027. Mebbe the orders has been changed, an\u0027 you haint heard about it,\" persisted Si. \"Mebbe the Orderly that was bringing \u0027em \u0027s stuck in the mud. Mebbe the rain\u0027s soaked \u0027em so\u0027s they can\u0027t be read. If anybody\u0027s got any dry matches I\u0027m goin\u0027 to chance28 it.\" Word was passed along the rail, and at length one of the boys was found to have some matches in a tin box which was proof against the rain. Si got out his knife and whittled down a corner of the rail until he came to the dry part, and got off some shavings. Splinters were contributed by the others, and after several failures a small flame was started. \"Here, what in the world are you men doing there?\" came in the stentorian tones of the Colonel, who it startled Si to discover was sitting a short distance behind him. \"Put that light out this instant.\" Even before the command could be obeyed, four great flashes burned out like lightning in the murky darkness on the hill-top. Four cannon roared, and four shells screeched toward Si and his companions, who instinctively toppled over backward into the mud. One of the shells struck in the mud a few yards in front, burst with a deafening report, and sent over them a deluge of very wet Tennessee real estate. \"The battery\u0027s out there yit, Si,\" said Shorty, as they gathered themselves up and carefully stamped out every spark of fire. \"It\u0027s \u0027tendin\u0027 strictly to business,\" remarked Wes Williams. \"Its ammynition don\u0027t seem to be a mite wet,\" added Jim Hutchinson. \"There, you see, now,\" said the Colonel sternly. \"I\u0027ll tie up by the thumbs the next man that dares scratch a match.\" \"You jest kin if I do,\" muttered Si, scraping off some of the superabundant mud, and resuming his29 seat on the rail. \"This dog\u0027s cured of suckin\u0027 eggs.\" He set the butt of his gun down in front of him, clasped his hands around the barrel, leaned his head on them, and went to sleep. He was so tired that he could have slept anywhere and in any position. He was dimly conscious during the night that the rain ceased and that it turned bitter cold. He was not going to wake up for trifles like that, though. When Si went to sleep he devoted himself entirely to that and nothing else. It 30 was one thing that he never allowed any interference with. But with the first gray streaks of dawn in the east some uneasy, meddlesome spirit in the 200th Ind. happened to be awake, and he awakened the Adjutant, who cuffed and shook the headquarters drummer until he awakened and beat the reveille. This aroused the weary Orderly-Sergeants, who started upon the task of getting up the bone-wracked, aching-muscled men. In 10 minutes there was enough discontent and bitter grumbling in the 200th Ind. to have furnished forth a new political party. The awakening process finally reached those of Co. Q who had roosted on Si\u0027s rail all night. Si vigorously insisted on being let alone; that he hadn\u0027t been asleep five minutes, and that, anyhow, it was not his turn to go on guard. But the Orderly-Sergeant of Co. Q was a persistent fellow, and would not be denied. When Si finally tried to rise he found that, in addition to the protests of his stiff legs, he was pinned firmly down. Feeling around to ascertain the cause, he discovered that the tail of his overcoat and his shoes had become deeply imbedded in the mud, and frozen solidly there. Shorty was in the same fix. Frozen in the Mud 29 \"Got to shuck yourself out o\u0027 your overcoat, and leave them gunboats anchored where they are,\" remarked Shorty, doing as he said, and falling in for roll-call in his stocking feet. After roll-call Si got a hatchet from one of the boys and chopped his and Shorty\u0027s shoes out. The overcoats were left for subsequent effort, for the first thing was to get some wood and water and cook breakfast.31 The morning was bitter cold and the sky overcast, but Si felt that this was a thousand times better than the cheerless rain, which seemed to soak his very life out of him. He pounded most of the frozen mud off his shoes, picked up the camp-kettle, and started off for wood and water, broke the ice on the creek, took a good wash, and presently came back with a load of dry pine and a kettle full of water. \"My joints feel like I think an old wagon does after it\u0027s gone about a year without greasing,\" he remarked to Shorty, who had a good fire going; \"but I think that after I get about a quart o\u0027 hot coffee, inside of me, with a few pounds o\u0027 pork and crackers, I\u0027ll be nearly as good as new again. My, how good that grub does smell! An\u0027 did you ever see such a nice fire?\" He chopped his and Shorty\u0027s overcoats out while Shorty was cooking breakfast, and when at last he sat down on one end of his rail and ate enough toasted hard bread and crisp fried side-meat to feed a small family for a week, washing it down with something near a quart of black coffee sweetened with coarse brown sugar, life began again to have some charms for him. \"You\u0027re sure that dumbed battery\u0027s gone that shot at us last night, are you, Shorty?\" he said, as he drained his cup, fastened it again to the strap of his haversack, and studied the top of the hill with a critical eye. \"They say it is,\" said Shorty, between bites. \"While you was down at the crick a man come over from the camp o\u0027 the Oshkosh Terrors, and said two o\u0027 their32 companies \u0027d been onto the hill, and the rebels had gone.\" \"I wish them Oshkosh fellers\u0027d mind their own business,\" said Si, irritably, as he picked up his gun and began rubbing the mud and rust off. \"They\u0027re entirely too fresh for a new regiment. That battery was none of theirs. It was ours, right in our front, an\u0027 if they\u0027d let it alone till after breakfast we\u0027d gone up and taken it. It was just the right size for the 200th Ind., and we wanted a chance at it. But now they\u0027ve had to stick in and run it off.\" \"Don\u0027t worry,\" said Shorty, fishing out another cracker; \"it hasn\u0027t gone too far. \u0027Taint lost. You\u0027ll have a chance at it some other time. Mebbe to-day yet.\" The army began to move out very promptly, and soon the 200th Ind. was called to take its place in the long column that crawled over the hills and across the valleys toward Murfreesboro, like some gigantic blue serpent moving toward his prey. Miles ahead of the 200th Ind.\u0027s place in the column the rebels were offering annoying disputation of farther progress. Lines as brown as the dried leaves on the oak trees would form on the hilltops, batteries would gallop into position, and there would be sharp bangs by the cannon and a sputter of musketry-fire. Then the long, blue serpent would wriggle out of the road into the fields, as if coiling to strike. union batteries would rush on to hilltops and fire across valleys at the rebel cannon, and a sputter of musketry would answer that from the leaf-brown ranks on the hilltops, which would dissolve and march back33 to the next hilltop, where the thing would be gone over again. The 200th Ind. would occasionally see one of these performances as it marched over and down one of the hills. As the afternoon was wearing away the 200th34 Ind. kept nearing the front, where this was going on. Finally, when the dull day was shading into dusk, and the brigade ahead of it was forming in the field at the foot of a hill to open a bickering fire against the dun line at the top, the 200th Ind. was taken off the road and marched away over to the left, where it was put into line in front of a dense grove of cedars. \"Capt. McGillicuddy,\" commanded the Colonel to the Captain of Co. Q, \"advance your company as skirmishers to the edge of the cedars, and send a Corporal and five men into the thicket to see if there is anything there.\" \"Corporal Klegg,\" said the Captain, \"take five men off the left of the company and go in and see what\u0027s in there.\" Si was instantly fired with the importance of the duty assigned him. He sent two of his men to the left, two to the right, while he and Shorty, a little distance apart, struck for the heart of the thicket. They made their way with difficulty through the dense chaparral for some minute\u0027s, and then stopped, as they heard voices and the crashing of branches in front. Si\u0027s heart thumped against his ribs. He looked over to his left, and saw Shorty standing there peering earnestly into the brush, with his gun cocked and ready to fire. He ran over to him and whispered: \"What do you see, Shorty?\" What Do You See, Shorty?\u0027 33 \"Nothin\u0027 yit, but I expect to every minute,\" replied Shorty, without turning his intent eyes. Si\u0027s gun was already cocked, and he bent his head 35forward eagerly, to get a better view. But he could see nothing, except that the tops of the bushes were shaking. \"Shall we skip back an\u0027 report?\" asked Si. \"I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 till I see something,\" said Shorty, stoutly. \"Nor me,\" echoed Si, rather ashamed that he had suggested it. \"Steady, there; steady, on the right! Come for ward with that left company,\" called out a stern voice in front. \"Must be a full regiment in there,\" whispered Si, craning his neck still farther. The tramping and crashing increased. \"Steady, men, I tell you! Steady! Press on the center,\" commanded the unseen Colonel. \"Forward! Forward!\" In spite of his perturbation, Si noticed that the sounds did not seem to be coming any nearer. \"We must get a squint at \u0027em,\" he said, desperately, to Shorty. \"Let\u0027s git down an\u0027 crawl forward. There must be an openin\u0027 somewhere.\" They got down on their hands and knees, so as to avoid as many as possible of the thickly-interlaced branches. Soon they came to a rift which led to an opening of some rods in circumference. Raising their heads cautiously above a moss-covered log, they saw in the opening a stalwart Sergeant with five or six men. The Sergeant was standing there with his eyes fixed on the tops of the trees, apparently thinking of the next series of commands he was to give, while the men were busy breaking limbs off the cedars. Si and Shorty immediately grasped the situation.36 \"Forward, Co. Q!\" yelled Si at the top of his lungs. \"Surrender, you consarned rebels, or we\u0027ll blow your heads off,\" he added, as he and Shorty jumped forward into the opening and leveled their guns on the squad. \"What\u0027n thunder was you fellers makin\u0027 all that racket fur,\" Si asked the Sergeant as he was marching him back to the skirmish-line. \"Ouah Cunnel,\" explained the Sergeant, \"wuz afeared you\u0027ns \u0027d try to flank us through the thicket, and sent me down to make a rumpus and hold you back while he fit you in front. But whar\u0027s your company?\" \"We\u0027ll come to it soon,\" said Si.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63213.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
