{"id":45095,"no":60,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. THE JEW SPY WRITES","content":"SHORTY HAS AN ADVENTURE WITH A LONE, LORN WIDDER LADY.\" \"I WONDER what has become of our Jew spy, Shorty?\" said Si, as he and Shorty sat on the bank of Duck River and watched the rebel pickets lounging under the beeches on the other side. \"We hain\u0027t heard nothin\u0027 of him for more\u0027n a month now.\" \"He\u0027s probably hung,\" answered Shorty. \"He was entirely too smart to live long. A man can\u0027t go on always pokin\u0027 his finger into a rattlesnake\u0027s jaw without gittin\u0027 it nipped sooner or later.\" \"I\u0027m looking fur a man called Si Klegg,\" they heard behind them. Looking around they saw the tall, gaunt woman whom they had turned back from entering the camp a few days before, under the belief that she was trying to smuggle in whisky. \"What in the world can she want o\u0027 me?\" thought Si; but he answered: \"That\u0027s my name. What\u0027ll you have?\" A flash of recognition filled at once her faded blue eyes. Without taking her pipe from between her yellow, snaggly teeth she delivered a volley of tobacco-juice at an unoffending morning-glory, and snapped out: \"O, y\u0027r him, air ye? Y\u0027r the dratted measly180 sapsucker that bounced me \u0027bout takin\u0027 likker inter camp. What bizniss wuz hit o\u0027 your\u0027n whether I tuk likker in or not? Jest wanted t\u0027 be smart, didn\u0027t ye? Jest wanted t\u0027 interfere with a lone, lorn widder lady makin\u0027 a honest livin\u0027 for herself and 10 children. My ole man ketched the black ager layin\u0027 out in the brush to dodge the conscripters. It went plumb to his heart an\u0027 killed him. He wa\u0027n\u0027t no great loss, nohow, fur he\u0027d eat more in a week than he\u0027d kill, ketch, or raise in a year. When his light went out I\u0027d only one less mouth to feed, and got rid o\u0027 his jawin\u0027 an\u0027 cussin\u0027 all the time. But that hain\u0027t nothin\u0027 t\u0027 do with you. You \u0027s jest puttin\u0027 on a lettle authority kase ye could. But all men air alike that-a-way. Elect a man Constable, an\u0027 he wants t\u0027 put on more airs than the Guv-nor; marry him, an\u0027 he makes ye his slave.\" \"I should think it\u0027d be a bold man that\u0027d try to make you his slave. Madam,\" Si ventured. \"Y\u0027 she\u0027d think,\" she retorted, with her arms akimbo. \"Who axed y\u0027 t\u0027 think, young feller? What d\u0027 y\u0027 do hit with. Why d\u0027 y\u0027 strain y\u0027rself doin\u0027 somethin\u0027 y\u0027 ain\u0027t used t\u0027?\" It did Shorty so much good to see Si squelched, that he chuckled aloud and called out: \"Give it to him, old Snuff-Dipper. He\u0027s from the Wabash, an\u0027 hain\u0027t no friends. He\u0027s bin itchin\u0027 a long time for jest such a skinnin\u0027 as you\u0027re givin\u0027 him.\" \"Who air y\u0027 callin\u0027 Snuff-Dipper?\" she retorted, turning angrily on Shorty. \"What\u0027ve ye got t\u0027 say agin snuff-dippin\u0027, anyway, y\u0027 terbacker-chawin\u0027, likker-guzzlin\u0027, wall-oyed, splay-footed, knock-kneed181 oaf? What air y\u0027 greasy hirelings a-comin\u0027 down heah fo\u0027, t\u0027 sass and slander Southern ladies, who air yo\u0027 superiors?\" \"Give it to him, old Corncob Pipe,\" yelled Si \"He needs lambastin\u0027 worse\u0027n any man in the regiment. But what did you want to see me for?\" \"I wanted to see yo\u0027 bekase I got a letter to yo\u0027 from a friend o\u0027 mine, who said yo\u0027 wuz gentlemen, an\u0027 rayly not Yankees at all. He said that yo\u0027 wuz forced into the army agin yo\u0027 will.\" \"Gracious, what a liar that man must be,\" murmured Shorty to himself. \"An\u0027 yo\u0027 rayly had no heart to fight for the nigger, an\u0027 that yo\u0027d treat me like a sister.\" \"A sister,\" Shorty exploded internally. \"Think of a feller\u0027s havin\u0027 a sister like that. Why, I wouldn\u0027t throw her in a soap-grease barrel.\" \"Who was this friend. Madam?\" said Si, \"and where is his letter?\" \"I don\u0027t know whether to give it to yo\u0027 or not,\" said she. \"Y\u0027re not the men at all that he ascribed to me. He said yo\u0027 wuz very good-lookin\u0027, perlite gentlemen, who couldn\u0027t do too much for a lady.\" \"Sorry we\u0027re not as handsome as you expected,\" said Si; \"but mebbe that\u0027s because we\u0027re in fatigue uniforms. You ought to see my partner there when he\u0027s fixed up for parade. He\u0027s purtier\u0027n a red wagon then. Let me see the letter. I can tell then whether we\u0027re the men or not.\" \"Kin yo\u0027 read?\" she asked suspiciously. \"O, yes,\" answered Si laughingly at the thought almost universal in the South that reading and writing were—like the Gift of Tongues—a special182 dispensation to a few favored individuals only. \"I can read and do lots o\u0027 things that common people can\u0027t. I\u0027m seventh son of a seventh son, born with a caul on my head at the time o\u0027 the full moon. Let me see the letter.\" She was not more than half convinced, but unhooked her dress and took a note from her bosom, which she stuck out toward Si, holding tightly on to one end in the meanwhile. Si read, in Levi Rosenbaum\u0027s flourishing, ornate handwriting: \"Corporal Josiah Klegg, Co. Q, 200th Indiana Volunteers, in Camp on Duck River.\" \"That means me,\" said Si, taking hold of the end of the envelope. \"There ain\u0027t but one 200th Injianny Volunteers; there\u0027s no other Co. Q, and I\u0027m the only Josiah Klegg.\" The woman still held on to the other end of the letter. \"It comes,\" continued Si, \"from a man a little under medium size, with black hair and eyes, dresses well, talks fast, and speaks a Dutch brogue.\" \"That\u0027s him,\" said the woman, relinquishing the letter, and taking a seat under the shade of a young cucumber tree, where she proceeded to fill her pipe, while awaiting the reading of the missive. Si stepped off a little ways, and Shorty looked over his shoulder as he opened the letter and read: \"Dear Boys: This will be handed you, if it reaches you at all, by Mrs. Bolster, who has more about her than you think.\"183 \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" muttered Shorty; \"the last time I had the pleasure o\u0027 meetin\u0027 the lady she had \u0027steen dozen bottles o\u0027 head-bust about her.\" \"She\u0027s a Confederate, as far as she goes.\" Si continued reading, \"which is not very far. She don\u0027t go but a little ways. A jay-bird that did not have any more brains would not build much of a nest. But she is very useful to me, and I want you to get in with her. As soon as you read this I want Si to give her that pair of horn combs I gave him. Do it at once. Sincerely your friend, \"Levi Rosenbaum.\" Si knit his brows in perplexity and wonderment over this strange message. He looked at Shorty, but Shorty\u0027s face was as blank of explanation as his own. He fumbled around in his blouse pocket, drew forth the combs, and handed them to the woman. Her dull face lighted up visibly. She examined the combs carefully, as if fitting them to a description, and, reaching in her bosom, pulled out another letter and handed it to Si. When this was opened Si read: \"Dear Boys: Now you will understand the comb business. I wanted to make sure that my letter reached the right men, and the combs were the only things I could think of at the moment. Mrs. B. will prize them, though she will never think of using them, either on herself or one of her shock-headed brats. I want you to play it on her as far as your consciences will allow. Pretend that you are awful sick of this Abolition war, and tired fighting for the nigger, and all that stuff. Make her the happiest184 woman in Tennessee by giving her all the coffee you can spare. That will fetch her quicker and surer than anything else. Like most Southern women, she is a coffee-drinker first and a rebel afterward, and if some preacher would tell her that heaven is a place where she will get all the Yankee coffee she can drink, she would go to church regularly for the rest of her life. Tell her a lot of news—as much of it true as you can and think best; as much of it otherwise as you can invent. Follow her cautiously when she leaves camp. Don\u0027t let her see you do so. You will find that she will lead you to a nest of spies, and the place where all the whisky is furnished to sell in camp. I write you thus freely because I am certain that this will get in your hands. I know that your regiment is out here, because I have been watching it for a week, with reference to its being attacked. It won\u0027t be for at least awhile, for there\u0027s another hen on. But make up to the old lady as much as your consciences and stomachs will allow you. It will be for the best interests of the service. \"Sincerely your friend, Levi Rosenbaum.\" \"I wonder what game Levi is up to?\" Si said, as he stood with the letter in his hand and looked at the woman. \"I\u0027ll give her all the coffee I can and be very civil to her, but that\u0027s as far as I\u0027ll go. The old rebel cat. I\u0027ll not lie to her for 40 Levi Rosenbaums.\" \"Well, I will,\" said Shorty. \"You fix her up with the coffee, and leave the rest to me. I always had a fancy for queer animals, and run off from home once to travel with a menagerie. I\u0027d like to take her up185 North and start a side-show with her. \u0027The Queen o\u0027 the Raccoon Mountains,\u0027 or the \u0027Champion Snuff-Dipper o\u0027 the Sequatchie Valley.\u0027 How\u0027d that do for a sign?\" \"Well, go ahead,\" said Si. \"But expect no help from me.\" \"Mr. Klegg, when I want your help in courtin\u0027 a lady I\u0027ll let you know,\" said Shorty with dignity. Si went back to the tent to see about getting the coffee, and Shorty approached Mrs. Bolster with an engaging expression on his countenance. She was knocking the ashes out of her pipe. \"Let me fill your pipe up again. Madam, with something very choice,\" said he, pulling out a plug of bright natural leaf. \"Here\u0027s some terbacker the like o\u0027 which you never see in all your born days. It was raised from seed stole from the private stock of the High-muk-a-muk o\u0027 Turkey, brung acrost the ocean in a silver terbacker box for the use o\u0027 President Buchanan, and planted in the new o\u0027 the moon on a piece o\u0027 ground that never before had raised nothin\u0027 but roses and sweet-williams. My oldest brother, who is a Senator from Oshkosh, got just one plug of it, which he divided with me.\" \"O, my! is that true?\" she gurgled. \"It\u0027s as true as that you are a remarkably fine lookin\u0027 woman,\" he said with unblushing countenance, as he began whittling off some of the tobacco to fill her pipe. \"I was struck by your appearance as soon as I saw you. I always was very fond of the Southern ladies.\" \"Sakes alive, air y\u0027?\" she asked; \"then what air yo\u0027uns down here foutin\u0027 we\u0027uns fur?\"186 \"That\u0027s a long story, m\u0027m,\" answered Shorty. \"It was a trick o\u0027 the Abolition politicians that got us into it. I\u0027m awful sick o\u0027 the war (that we hain\u0027t gone ahead and knocked the heads offen this whole crowd instead o\u0027 layin\u0027 \u0027round here in camp for months)\" he added as a mental reservation, \"and wisht I was out of it (after we\u0027ve hung Jeff Davis on a sour-apple tree). Then I might settle down here and marry some nice woman. You\u0027re a widder, I believe you said.\" \"Yes, I\u0027m a widder,\" she answered, taking her pipe from her mouth and giving him what she intended for a languishing smile, but which Shorty afterward said reminded him of a sun-crack in a mud fence. \"Yes, I\u0027m a widder. Bin so for gwine on six months. Sakes alive, but ye do talk nice. You air the best-lookin\u0027 Yankee I\u0027ve ever seed.\" \"Nothin\u0027 painfully bashful about her,\" thought Shorty. \"But I must be careful not to let her get me near a Justice of the Peace. She\u0027d marry me before I could ketch my breath. Madam,\" he continued aloud. \"Yo\u0027 may call me Sophrony,\" she said, with another cavernous smile. \"Well, Sophrony, let me present you with half o\u0027 this plug o\u0027 famous terbacker.\" He drew his jackknife and sliced the plug in two. \"Take it, with my warmest respects. Here comes my partner with some coffee I\u0027ve sent him for, and which I want you to have. It is not as much as I\u0027d like to give you, but it\u0027s all that I have. Some other day you shall have much more.\" \"Law\u0027s sakes.\" she bubbled, as the fragrant odor187 of the coffee reached her nose, and she hefted the package. \"Yo\u0027 air jest the nicest man I ever did see in all my born days. I didn\u0027t s\u0027pose thar wuz so nice a man, or sich a good-lookin\u0027 one, in the hull Yankee army, or in the oonfederit either, fur that matter. But, then, yo\u0027 ain\u0027t no real blue-bellied Yankee.\" \"No, indeed, Sophrony. I never saw New England in all my life, nor did any o\u0027 my people. They wuz from Virginny (about 500 miles, as near as I kin calculate)\" he added to himself as a mental poultice. \"Say, Mister, why don\u0027t you leave the Yankee army?\" \"Can\u0027t,\" said Shorty, despairingly. \"If I tried to git back home the Provos \u0027ll ketch me. If I go the other way the rebel\u0027s ketch me. I\u0027m betwixt the devil and the deep sea.\" She sat and smoked for several minutes in semblance of deep thought, and spat with careful aim at one after another of the prominent weeds around. Then she said: \"If yo\u0027 want t\u0027 splice with me, I kin take keer o\u0027 yo\u0027. I\u0027ve helped run off several o\u0027 the boys who wuz sick o\u0027 this Abolition war. Thar\u0027s two o\u0027 them now with Bill Phillips\u0027s gang makin\u0027 it hot for the Yankee trains and camps. They\u0027re makin\u0027 more\u0027n they ever did soljerin\u0027, an\u0027 havin\u0027 a much better time, for they take whatever they want, no matter who it belongs to. D\u0027 yo\u0027 know Groundhog, a teamster? He\u0027s in cahoots with us.\" \"Oh!\" said Shorty to himself. \"Here\u0027s another lay altogether. Guess it\u0027s my duty to work it for all that it\u0027s worth.\"188 \"Is it a bargain?\" she said suddenly, stretching out her long, skinny hand. \"Sophrony,\" said Shorty, taking her hand, \"this is so sudden. I never thought o\u0027 marryin\u0027—at least till this cruel war is over. I don\u0027t know what kind of a husband I\u0027d make. I don\u0027t know whether I could fill the place o\u0027 your late husband!\" \"Yo\u0027re not gwine t\u0027 sneak out,\" she said, with a fierce flash in her gray eyes. \"If yo\u0027 do I\u0027ll have yo\u0027 pizened.\" \"Now, who\u0027s talkin\u0027 about backin\u0027 out?\" said Shorty in a fever of placation, for he was afraid that some of the other boys would overhear the conversation. \"Don\u0027t talk so loud. Come, let\u0027s walk on toward your home. We kin talk on the way.\" The proposition appeared reasonable. She took the bridle of her horse in her arm, and together they walked out through the guard-line. The sentries gave Shorty a deep, knowing wink as he passed. He went the more willingly, as he was anxious to find out more about the woman, and the operations of the gang with which she was connected. She had already said enough to explain several mysterious things of recent occurrence. Night came down and as her ungainliness was not thrust upon him as it was in the broad glare of day, he felt less difficulty in professing a deep attachment for her. He even took her hand. On her part she grew more open and communicative at every step, and Shorty had no difficulty in understanding that there was gathered around her a gang that was practicing about everything detrimental to the army. They were by turns spies, robbers, murderers, whisky189 smugglers, horse-thieves, and anything else that promised a benefit to themselves. Ostensibly they were rebels, but this did not prevent their preying upon the rebels when occasion offered. Some were deserters from the rebel army, some were evading the conscript laws, two or three were deserters from our army. Shorty and the woman had reached a point nearly a half-mile outside of the guard-line when he stopped and said: \"I can\u0027t go no farther now. I must go back.\" \"Why must yo\u0027 go back?\" she demanded, with a190 sudden angry suspicion. \"I thought yo\u0027 wuz gwine right along with me.\" \"Why, no. I never thought o\u0027 that. I must go back and get my things before I go with you,\" said Shorty, as the readiest way of putting her off. \"Plague take y\u0027r things,\" she said. \"Let \u0027em go. Yo\u0027 kin git plenty more jest as good from the next Yankee camp. Yo\u0027 slip back some night with the boys an\u0027 git yo\u0027r own things, if y\u0027r so dratted stuck on \u0027em. Come along now.\" She took hold of his wrist with a grip like iron. Shorty had no idea that a woman could have such strength. \"I want to go back and git my partner,\" said Shorty. \"Me and him \u0027ve bin together all the time we\u0027ve bin in the army. He\u0027ll go along with me, I\u0027m sure. Me and him thinks alike on everything, and what one starts the other jines in. I want to go back an\u0027 git him.\" \"I don\u0027t like that partner o\u0027 your\u0027n. I don\u0027t want him. I\u0027ll be a better partner t\u0027 yo\u0027 than ever he was. Yo\u0027 mustn\u0027t think more o\u0027 him than yo\u0027 do o\u0027 me.\" \"Look here, Sophrony,\" said Shorty desperately, \"I cannot an\u0027 will not go with you to-night. I\u0027m expectin\u0027 important letters from home to-morrow, and I must go back an\u0027 git \u0027em. I\u0027ve a thousand things to do before I go away. Have some sense. This thing\u0027s bin sprung on me so suddenly that it ketches me unawares.\" With the quickness of a flash she whipped out a long knife from somewhere, and raised it, and then hesitated a second. She Whipped out a Long Knife. 189 \"I believe yo\u0027re foolin\u0027 me, and if I wuz shore I\u0027d191 stick yo\u0027. But I\u0027m gwine t\u0027 give yo\u0027 a chance. Yo\u0027 kin go back now, an\u0027 I\u0027ll come for yo\u0027 ter-morrer. If you go back on me hit\u0027ll be a mouty sorry day for yo\u0027. Mind that now.\" Shorty gallantly helped her mount, and then hurried back to camp.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63247.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
