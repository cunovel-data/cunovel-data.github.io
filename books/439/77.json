{"id":45112,"no":77,"title":"CHAPTER XI. THE MOUNTAIN FOLK","content":"THE SHADOW OF AN EAST TENNESSEE VENDETTA. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE long roll turned out to be occasioned by the burning of a union Tennesseean\u0027s house by a squad of revengeful guerrillas, but the regiment had to stay under arms until a party of cavalry went out and made an investigation. The men stacked their arms, and lay around on the ground to get what sleep was possible, and which was a good deal, for the night was pleasant, and there are worse beds than the mossy hillside on a July night. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Too bad that your weddin\u0027 night had to be broken up so,\" said Si sympathetically, as he and Shorty and the bridegroom sat together on a knoll and watched the distant flames. \"But you needn\u0027t \u0027ve come with us this time; nobody expected you to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, I s\u0027posed this wuz part o\u0027 the regler thing,\" answered Nate in amazement. \"I s\u0027posed that wuz the way yo\u0027uns allers married folkses in the army. Allers something happens at weddin\u0027s down hyah. Mos\u0027 ginerully hit\u0027s a free fout betwixt the young fellers o\u0027 the bride\u0027s an\u0027 bridegroom\u0027s famblies, from \u0027sputin\u0027 which fambly\u0027s made the best match. When Brother Wils married Becky Barnstable we Hartburn boys said that Wils mout-ve looked higher. The Barnstable boys done tuk hit up, an\u0027 said the Barnstables wuz ez good ez the Hartburns ary day in the week, an\u0027 at the weddin\u0027 Nels Barnstable had his eye gouged out, Ike Barnstable wuz knocked down with a flail, an\u0027 had what the doctor called discussion o\u0027 the brain, and ole Sandy Barnstable cut off Pete Hartburn\u0027s ear with a bowie. They-uns reopened the argyment at the infair, an\u0027 laid out two o\u0027 the Hartburns with ox-gads. I don\u0027t think they orter used ox-gads. Tain\u0027t gentlemanly. D\u0027ye think so? Knives, an\u0027 pistols, an\u0027 guns, an\u0027 even flails an\u0027 axes, is all right, when you can\u0027t git nothin\u0027 better, but I think ox-gads is low an\u0027 onery.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si and Shorty looked at the gentle, drawling, mild-eyed young Tennesseean with amazement. A young girl could not have seemed softer or more pliant, yet he quietly talked of savage fighting as one of the most casual things in life. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Shorty, \"if that\u0027s the way you celebrat weddin\u0027s and in-fairs down here in Tennessee, I don\u0027t wonder that you welcome a battle for a change. I think I\u0027d prefer a debate with guns to one with axes and flails and anything that\u0027d come handy. It\u0027s more reg\u0027ler to have umpires and referees, and the thing conducted accordin\u0027 to the rules of the P. R. Then when you git through you know for sure who\u0027s licked.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jist \u0027cordin\u0027 t\u0027 how one\u0027s raised,\" remarked Nate philosophically. \"I\u0027ve allers done seed a big furse o\u0027 some kind at a weddin\u0027. Don\u0027t all yo\u0027uns have none at yo\u0027uns\u0027s weddin\u0027s?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothin\u0027 worse\u0027n gittin\u0027 the girl\u0027s dad to consent,\" answered Shorty, \"and scratchin\u0027 \u0027round to git the money to git married on to buy a new suit o\u0027 clothes, fee the preacher, pay for the license, and start housekeepin\u0027. That\u0027s enough for one lifetime.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, mam an\u0027 the gals made Wils\u0027s weddin\u0027 cloze,\" said Nate reflectively. \"He had his own sheep, which he sheared in the Spring. They\u0027uns carded, spun, dyed, an\u0027 wove the wool themselves, an\u0027 made him the purtiest suit o\u0027 cloze ever seed on the mountings.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your mother and sisters goin\u0027 to make your weddin\u0027 suit, Si?\" asked Shorty. \"What\u0027d he have to pay for the license?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"License? What\u0027s that?\" asked Nate. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"License? Why, a license,\" explained Si, \"is something you git from the County Clerk. It\u0027s leave to git married, and published in the County paper.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t have t\u0027 have no leave from nobody down here t\u0027 git married. Hit\u0027s nobody\u0027s business but the man\u0027s an\u0027 the gal\u0027s, an\u0027 they\u0027uns\u0027s famblies. Some times other folkses tries t\u0027 stick their noses in, but they\u0027uns git sot down upon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027d he pay the preacher?\" asked Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, mam gin his wife a hank o\u0027 fine stockin\u0027 yarn, an\u0027 dad gin him a couple sides o\u0027 bacon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At present prices o\u0027 pork in Injianny,\" remarked Si, after a little mental figuring, \"that wasn\u0027t such a bad fee.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you speak to the Captain,\" suggested Si, \"he\u0027ll let you go back home to your wife. I don\u0027t believe there\u0027s goin\u0027 to be anything special to-night. The cavalry don\u0027t seem to be stirrin\u0027 up nothin out there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t keer t\u0027,\" said Nate, in his sweet, girlish drawl. \"Ruther stay with yo\u0027all. Mout somethin\u0027 happen. Biff Perkins an\u0027 his gang o\u0027 gorillers is out thar somewhar, not fur off, huntin\u0027 a chance fur deviltry. I\u0027d like mouty t\u0027 git a whack at they\u0027uns. Nance\u0027ll keep. She\u0027s mine now, fast an\u0027 good, for ever, an\u0027ll wait fur me. Afore we wuz spliced I wuz afeered Zach Barnstable mout work some contrivance t\u0027 git her, but now she belongs t\u0027 me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys took him to their hearts more than ever. \\n\\n \\n\\n At the coming of the early dawn the regiment was aroused and marched back to camp, there to meet orders to move forward at once, as soon as breakfast was prepared and eaten. Away it marched for the Tennessee River, behind which Bragg was supposed to be gathering his forces for the defense of Chattanooga. \\n\\n \\n\\n As Co. Q went by the cabin, Grandfather Onslow was seated in a rocking-chair on the porch, smoking a cob pipe, while Mrs. Nancy Onslow Hartburn, with her finger bashfully in her mouth, peeped around the corner. Co. Q gave her a cheer, at which she turned and fled out of sight, as if it was some raillery on her newly-married state, and Nate hung down his head, as if he, too, felt the boys were poking fun at him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good-by, boys. Lick the life outen Ole Bragg,\" quavered Grandfather Onslow, waving his hand after them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s what we\u0027re goin\u0027 to do,\" shouted the boys in reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Si, \"I bet if ever I\u0027m married I\u0027ll kiss my wife before I go away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Me, too,\" echoed Shorty, very soulfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty and Si considered Nate Hartburn their special protege, and were deeply anxious to transform him into a complete soldier in the shortest possible time. He was so young, alert, and seemingly pliable, that it appeared there would be no difficulty in quickly making him a model soldier. But they found that while he at once responded to any suggestion of a raid or a fight, drill, discipline and camp routine were bores that he could be induced to take only a languid interest in. Neither Si nor Shorty were any too punctilious in these matters, but they were careful to keep all the time within easy conversational distance of the regulations and tactics. Naturally, also, they wanted their pupil to do better than they did. But no lecturing would prevent young Hartburn from slouching around camp with his hands in his pockets and his head bent. He would not or could not keep step in the ranks, nor mark time. While Si was teaching him he would make a listless attempt to go through the manual of arms, but he would make no attempt to handle his gun the prescribed way after the lesson was ended. Si was duly mindful of the sore time he himself had in learning the drill, and tried to be very considerate with him, but his patience was sorely tried at times. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"For goodness\u0027 sake, Nate,\" Si would say irritably, \"try to keep step. You\u0027re throwin\u0027 everybody out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Tain\u0027t my fault, Si,\" Nate would reply with a soft drawl. \"Hit\u0027s theirs. I\u0027m walkin\u0027 all right, but they\u0027uns hain\u0027t. Jaw them. What\u0027s the sense o\u0027 walkin\u0027 so\u0027 close together, anyway? Yo\u0027 don\u0027t git thar no sooner.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then again: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Great jumpin\u0027 Jehosephat, Nate, will you never learn the right way to hold your gun when you present arms? You must turn the trigger outside, not the hammer.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, Jeminy, what difference does hit make? I never kin recollect hit, an\u0027 what\u0027s the use o\u0027 tryin\u0027? Can\u0027t see no sense in holdin\u0027 a gun straight up an\u0027 down that-a-way, anyway, an\u0027 if yo\u0027 do, hain\u0027t one side jest as good as t\u0027other?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He was so obdurate that the boys would some times be provoked to sharp words to him, but his gentle speech would quickly disarm them again, and make them feel penitent. \\n\\n \\n\\n At last the 200th Ind. came out upon the crest of Waldron\u0027s Ridge, overlooking the Tennessee River, which wound and turned amid the towering mountains like a band of bright silver traversing the giant billows of green. Everyone caught his breath at the sight, for beyond the stream were rebel camps, and moving trains and long, lines of marching men. Was all of Bragg\u0027s army gathered over there to dispute the passage or was a part still this side of the river, ready to pounce on our heads of columns as they meandered down the mountain? \\n\\n \\n\\n The brigade was closed up, information sent to the Division Commander, and the 200th Ind. pushed to the front to develop whatever might be there. Si with Shorty and some others were sent ahead to feel for the enemy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Take him along?\" asked Si of Shorty in a low tone, with a nod toward Nate, as they were making up the squad. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t know,\" answered Shorty. \"If ever in the world, we want men with us to-day who don\u0027t git rattled, and make a holy show o\u0027 theirselves before the regiment, but\u0027ll keep cool, watch their chances, and obey orders. Guess we\u0027d better leave him behind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Seems to me,\" said Si, trying vaguely to recall his Scriptual readings, \"that the Bible says some thing agin takin\u0027 a newly-married man right into battle just after he\u0027s married.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He looked around again, saw Nate taking his place along with the other men selected, and called out: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here, Nate, fall back to the company. You can\u0027t go along.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Please, Mister Si, le\u0027 me go along,\" begged Nate, in the soft tones of a girl asking for a flower. \"I\u0027ll be good. I\u0027ll hold my gun straight, an\u0027 try t\u0027 keep step.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, you can\u0027t go., This \u0027s partickler business, and we want only experienced men with us. Better fall back to the company.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go ahead, there, Corporal,\" commanded the Adjutant. \"Time\u0027s passing. We must move.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si deployed his men and entered the dense woods which curtained the view and shrouded the enemy. It was one of those deeply anxious moments in war, when the enemy is in ambush, and the next instant, the next step may develop him in deadly activity. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si was on the right of his line and Shorty on the left, and they were pushing forward slowly, cautiously, and with every sense strained to the extremity of alertness. \\n\\n \\n\\n So dense was the foliage overhead that it was almost a twilight in the forest depths they were penetrating, and Si\u0027s eyes were strained to keep track of the men moving on his left, and at the same time watch the developments in front. He had noticed that he was approaching a little opening some distance ahead, and that beyond it was a dense thicket of tall laurels. Then he thought he heard a low whistle from Shorty, and looked far to the left, while continuing to walk forward. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly he was startled by a shot a little to his rear and left. Then a shot answered from the laurel thicket, he saw the bushes over there stir violently, and he heard Nate\u0027s voice say: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He wuz layin\u0027 for yo\u0027, Si, an\u0027 come nigh a-gittin\u0027 yo\u0027, but I think I must\u0027ve at least creased him, from the wild way he shot back. Le\u0027s go forrard an\u0027 see.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I thought I told you to stay back,\" said Si, more intent on military discipline than his escape. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know yo\u0027 did done hit, but I couldn\u0027t mind, an\u0027 tagged \u0027long arter yo\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How\u0027d you know he wuz there?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I done seed the bushes move over his head. I knowed jest how he wuz a-layin\u0027 for yo\u0027. Le\u0027s go forrard an\u0027 git him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si and Nate ran across the open space to the laurels, and found a little ways in a bushwhacker staggering from pain and loss of blood from a wound in his hip, and making labored efforts to escape. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I done hit him; I done fetched him; I done knowed jist whar he wuz,\" exclaimed Nate with boyish exultation. \\n\\n \\n\\n At the sound of his voice the bushwhacker turned around upon him an ugly, brutal face, full of savage hatred. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, hit\u0027s bad ole Wash Barnstable, what burnt daddy\u0027s stable with two horses, an\u0027 shot brother Wils through the arm. I\u0027ll jist job him in the heart with my bayonet,\" screamed the boy as he recognized the face. His own features became transfigured with rage, and he began fixing his bayonet. Si pushed forward and caught the bushwhacker by the shoulder and tore the gun from his hand. Nate came springing up, with his bayonet pointed directly at the man\u0027s heart. Si saw it in time to thrust it aside, saying in wrathful astonishment: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nate, you little scoundrel, what do you mean? Would you kill a wounded man?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Suttenly I\u0027ll done kill him,\" screamed the boy in a a frenzy of rage. \"Why not? He desarves hit, the hell-hound. All of us Hartburns \u0027ve said we\u0027d done kill him the minnit we laid eyes on him. Now that I\u0027ve got him I\u0027m gwine t\u0027 finish him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He made another vicious lunge at the man with his bayonet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed you\u0027re not,\" said Si, releasing his hold on the prisoner and catching Nate\u0027s gun. \"You mustn\u0027t kill a wounded man, you young wildcat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027you Must\u0027nt Kill a Wounded Man 143 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why not?\" shouted the boy, beside himself with rage. \"He\u0027s done killed lots o\u0027 men. He\u0027ll kill more if yo\u0027 let him go. He wuz layin\u0027 t\u0027 kill yo\u0027. Air yo\u0027 gwine t\u0027 gin him another chance to down yo\u0027?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si wrested the gun from him. Two or three other boys who had been attracted by the shot came up at this moment. Si gave the prisoner into the charge of one of them, with instructions to take him to the rear. Nate released his hold on his gun and made a jump for the one which the other boy had stood against a tree when he started to take hold of the prisoner. Again Si was too quick for him. He was by this time so angry that he was in the mood to give Nate a severe lesson, but the Adjutant, had ridden forward, called out: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go ahead, there, Corporal. We\u0027re just behind you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pick up your gun, there, Nate, and come along with me, if you kin behave yourself. There\u0027s work much more important than killin\u0027 wounded bushwhackers. Come along, this minute.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Nate hesitated a moment, then picked up his gun with a vengeful look at the prisoner. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll kill him yit. Mebbe I\u0027ll git a chance this evenin\u0027 yit,\" said he, and followed Si. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63264.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
