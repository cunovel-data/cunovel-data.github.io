THE DEACON GOES HOME","content":"SHORTY FALLS A VICTIM TO HIS GAMBLING PROPENSITIES. \\n\\n \\n\\n THE BOYS did not finish their tour of picket duty till the forenoon of the next day, and it was getting toward evening when they reached their own camp. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What in the world\u0027s going on at the house?\" Si asked anxiously, as they were standing on the regimental parade ground waiting to be dismissed. Strange sounds came floating from that direction. The scraping of a fiddle was mingled with yells, the rush of feet, and laughter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go over there and see,\" said the Deacon, who had sat down behind the line on a pile of the things they had brought back with them. He picked up the coffee-pot, the frying-pan, and one of the haversacks, and walked in the direction of the house. As he turned into the company street and came in sight of the cabin he looked for an instant, and then broke out: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m blamed if they don\u0027t seem to be havin\u0027 a nigger political rally there, with the house as campaign headquarters. Where in time could they have all come from? Looks like a crow-roost, with some o\u0027 the crows drunk.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Apparently, all the negro cooks, teamsters, officers\u0027 servants, and roustabouts from the adjoining camps39 had been gathered there, with Groundhog, Pilgarlic, and similar specimens of the white teamsters among them and leading them. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Negroes Merrymaking. 39 \\n\\n \\n\\n Seated on a log were three negroes, one sawing on an old fiddle, one picking a banjo, and one playing the bones. Two negroes were in the center of a ring, dancing, while the others patted \"Juba.\" All were more or less intoxicated. Groundhog and Pilgarlic were endeavoring to get up a fight between Abraham Lincoln and another stalwart, stupid negro, and were plying them with whisky from a canteen and egging them on with words.40 \\n\\n \\n\\n The Deacon strode up to Groundhog and, catching him by the arm, demanded sternly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are you doing, you miserable scoundrel? Stop it at once.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Groundhog, who had drunk considerable himself, and was pot-valiant, shook him off roughly, saying: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"G\u0027way from here, you dumbed citizen. This hain\u0027t none o\u0027 your bizniss. Go back to your haymow and leave soldiers alone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Deacon began divesting himself of his burden to prepare for action, but before he could do so, Shorty rushed in, gave Groundhog a vigorous kick, and he and Si dispersed the rest of the crowd in a hurry with sharp cuffs for all they could reach. The meeting broke up without a motion to adjourn. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Deacon caught Abraham Lincoln by the collar and shook him vigorously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You black rascal,\" he said, \"what\u0027ve you bin up to?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t \u0027spect you back so soon. Boss,\" gasped the negro. \"Said you wouldn\u0027t be back till termorrer.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No matter when you expected us back,\" said the Deacon, shaking him still harder, while Si winked meaningly at Shorty. \"What d\u0027ye mean by sich capers as this? You\u0027ve bin a-drinkin\u0027 likker, you brute.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cel\u0027bratun my freedom,\" gasped the negro. \"Groundhog done tole me to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to celebrate his razzled head offen him,\" exploded the Deacon. \"I\u0027ll welt him into dog\u0027s meat hash if I kin lay my hands on him. He\u0027s too mean and wuthless to even associate with mules. If I\u0027d a41 dog on my place as onery as he is I\u0027d give him a button before night. He\u0027s not content with bein\u0027 a skunk himself; he wants to drag everybody else down to his level. Learnin\u0027 you to drink whisky and fight as soon as you\u0027re out o\u0027 bondage. Next thing he\u0027ll be learnin\u0027 you to steal sheep and vote for Vallandigham. I\u0027d like to put a stone around his neck and feed him to the catfish.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was something so strange and earnest about the Deacon\u0027s wrath that it impressed the negro more than any of the most terrible exhibitions of wrath that he had seen his master make. He cowered down, and began crying in a maudlin way and begging: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pray God, Boss, don\u0027t be so hard on a poor nigger.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si, who had learned something more of the slave nature than his father, ended the unpleasant scene by giving Abraham Lincoln a sharp slap across the hips with a piece of clapboard and ordering: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pick up that camp-kettle, go to the spring and fill it, and git back here in short meter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The blow came to the negro as a welcome relief. It was something that he could understand. He sprang to his feet, grinned, snatched up the campkettle, and ran to the spring. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I must get that man away from here without delay,\" said the Deacon. \"The influences here are awful. They\u0027ll ruin him. He\u0027ll lose his soul if he stays here. I\u0027ll start home with him to-morrow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027ll do worse\u0027n lose his soul,\" grumbled Shorty, who had been looking over the provisions. \"He\u0027ll lose the top of his woolly head if he brings another42 gang o\u0027 coons around here to eat us out o\u0027 house and home. I\u0027ll be gosh durned if I don\u0027t believe they\u0027ve eat up even all the salt and soap. There ain\u0027t a crumb left of anything. Talk about losin\u0027 his soul. I\u0027d give six bits for something to make him lose his appetite.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take him home to-morrow,\" reiterated the Deacon. \"I raised over \u0027leven hundred bushels o\u0027 corn last year, \u0027bout 500 o\u0027 wheat, and just an even ton o\u0027 pork. I kin feed him awhile, anyway, but I don\u0027t know as I\u0027d chance two of him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027ll you do if you have him and the grasshoppers the same year, Pap?\" inquired Si. \\n\\n \\n\\n That night the Deacon began his preparations for returning home. He had gathered up many relics from the battlefield to distribute among his friends at home and decorate the family mantlepiece. There were fragments of exploded shells, some canister, a broken bayonet, a smashed musket, a solid 12-pound shot, and a quart or more of battered bullets picked up in his walks over the scenes of the heavy fighting. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Looks as if you were going into the junk business. Pap,\" commented Si, as the store was gathered on the floor. \\n\\n \\n\\n The faithful old striped carpetsack was brought out, and its handles repaired with stout straps. The thrifty Deacon insisted on taking home some of Si\u0027s and Shorty\u0027s clothes to be mended. The boys protested. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We don\u0027t mend clothes in the army, Pap,\" said Si. \"They ain\u0027t wuth it. We just wear \u0027em out throw \u0027em away, and draw new ones.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Deacon held out that his mother and sisters43 would take great pleasure in working on such things, from the feeling that they were helping the war along. Finally the matter was compromised by putting in some socks to be darned and shirts to be mended. Then the bullets, canister, round-shot, fragments of shell, etc., were filled in. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I declare,\" said the Deacon dubiously, as he hefted the carpetsack. \"It\u0027s goin\u0027 to be a job to lug that thing back home. Better hire a mule-team. But I\u0027ll try it. Mebbe it\u0027ll help work some o\u0027 the stupidity out o\u0027 Abraham Lincoln.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The whole of Co. Q and most of the regiment had grown very fond of the Deacon, and when it was noised around that he was going, they crowded in to say good-by, and give him letters and money to take home. The remaining space in the carpetsack and all that in the Deacon\u0027s many pockets were filled with these. \\n\\n \\n\\n The next morning the company turned out to a man and escorted him to the train, with Si and his father marching arm-in-arm at the head, the company fifers playing, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ain\u0027t I glad to get out of the Wilderness, \\n\\n Way down in Tennessee,\" \\n\\n \\n\\n and Abraham Lincoln, laden with the striped carpetsack, the smashed musket and other relics, bringing up the rear, under the supervision of Shorty. Tears stood in the old man\u0027s eyes as he stood on the platform of the car, and grasped Si\u0027s and Shorty\u0027s hands in adieu. His brief farewell was characteristic of the strong, self-contained Western44 man: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good-by, boys. God bless you. Take care of yourselves. Be good boys. Come home safe after the war.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Klegg Starts Home. 45 \\n\\n \\n\\n The boys stood and watched the train with sorrowful eyes until it had passed out of sight in the woods beyond Overall\u0027s Creek, and then turned to go to their camp with a great load of homesickness weighing down their hearts. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just think of it; he\u0027s going straight back to God\u0027s country,\" said someone near. \\n\\n \\n\\n A sympathetic sigh went up from all. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shet up,\" said Shorty savagely. \"I don\u0027t want to hear a word o\u0027 that kind. He pulled his hat down over his eyes, rammed his hands deep in his pockets, and strode off, trying to whistle \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When this cruel war is over,\" \\n\\n \\n\\n but the attempt was a dismal failure. Si separated from the crowd and joined him. They took an unfrequented and roundabout way back to camp. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I feel all broke up. Si,\" said Shorty. \"I wish that we were goin\u0027 into a fight, or something to stir us up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si understood his partner\u0027s mood, and that it was likely to result in an outbreak of some kind. He tried to get him over to the house, so that he could get him interested in work there. \\n\\n \\n\\n They came to a little hidden ravine, and found it filled with men playing that most fascinating of all gambling games to the average soldier—chucka-luck. There were a score of groups, each gathered around as45 many \"sweat-boards.\" Some of the men \"running\" the games were citizens, and some were in uniform. Each had before him a small board on which was sometimes painted, sometimes rudely marked with charcoal, numbers from 1 to 6. \\n\\n \\n\\n On some of the boards the numbers were indicated by playing-cards, from ace to six-spot, tacked down. The man who \"ran\" the game had a dice-box, with three dice. He would shake the box, turn it upside46 down on the board, and call upon the group in front of him to make their bets. \\n\\n \\n\\n The players would deposit their money on the numbers that they fancied, and then, after the inquiry, \"All down?\" the \"banker\" would raise the box and reveal the dice. Those who had put their money on any of the three numbers which had turned up, would be paid, while those who bet on the other three would lose. \\n\\n \\n\\n Chuck-a-luck was strictly prohibited in camp, but it was next to impossible to keep the men from playing it. Citizen gamblers would gain admittance to camp under various pretexts and immediately set up boards in secluded places, and play till they were discovered and run out, by which time they would have made enough to make it an inducement to try again whenever they could find an opportunity. They followed the army incessantly for this purpose, and in the aggregate carried off immense sums of the soldiers\u0027 pay. Chuck-a-luck is one of the fairest of gambling games, when fairly played, which it rarely or never is by a professional gambler. A tolerably quick, expert man finds little difficulty in palming the dice before a crowd of careless soldiers so as to transfer the majority of their bets to his pocket. The regular citizen gamblers were reinforced by numbers of insatiable chuck-a-luckers in the ranks, who would set up a \"board\" at the least chance, even under the enemy\u0027s fire, while waiting the order to move. \\n\\n \\n\\n Chuck-a-luck was Shorty\u0027s greatest weakness. He found it as difficult to pass a chuck-a-luck board as an incurable drunkard does to pass a dram-shop.47 \\n\\n \\n\\n Si knew this, and shuddered a little as he saw the \"layouts,\" and tried to get his partner past them. But it was of no use. Shorty was in an intractable mood. He must have a strong distraction. If he could not fight he would gamble. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to bust this feller\u0027s bank before I go another step,\" said he, stopping before one. \"I know him. He\u0027s the same feller that, you remember, I busted down before Nashville. I kin do it agin. He\u0027s a bum citizen gambler. He thinks he\u0027s the smartest chuck-a-lucker in the Army o\u0027 the Cumberland, but I\u0027ll learn him different.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t risk more\u0027n a dollar,\" begged Si as a final appeal. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All down?\" called the \"banker.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Allow doublin\u0027?\" inquired Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Double as much as you blamed please, so long\u0027s you put your money down,\" answered the \"banker\" defiantly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, then, here goes a dollar on that five-spot,\" said Shorty, \"skinning\" a bill from a considerable roll. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t allow more\u0027n 25 cents bet on single cards, first bet,\" said the \"banker,\" dismayed by the size of the roll. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thought you had some sand,\" remarked Shorty contemptuously. \"Well, then, here\u0027s 25 cents on the five-spot, and 25 cents on the deuce,\" and he placed shin-plasters on the numbers. \"Now, throw them dice straight, and no fingerin\u0027. I\u0027m watchin\u0027 you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Watch and be durned,\" said the \"banker\" surlily. \"Watch your own business, and I\u0027ll watch mine. I\u0027m as honest as you are any day.\"48 \\n\\n \\n\\n The \"banker\" lifted the box, and showed two sixes and a tray up. He raked in the bets on the ace, deuce, four and five-spots, and paid the others. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fifty cents on the deuce; 50 cents on the five,\" said Shorty, laying down the fractional currency. \\n\\n \\n\\n Again they lost. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A dollar on the deuce; a dollar on the five,\" said Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n The same ill luck. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Two dollars on the deuce; two dollars on the five,\" said Shorty, though Si in vain plucked his sleeve to get him away. \\n\\n \\n\\n The spots remained obstinately down. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Four dollars on the deuce; four dollars on the five,\" said Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n No better luck. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eight dollars on the deuce; eight dollars on the five,\" said Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Whew, there goes more\u0027n a month\u0027s pay,\" said the other players, stopping to watch the dice as they rolled out, with the deuce and five-spot down somewhere else than on top. \"And his roll\u0027s beginning to look as if an elephant had stepped on it. Now we\u0027ll see his sand.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come, Shorty, you\u0027ve lost enough. You\u0027ve lost too much already. Luck\u0027s agin you,\" urged Si. \"Come away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t goin\u0027,\" said Shorty, obstinately. \"Now\u0027s my chance to bust him. Every time them spots don\u0027t come up increases the chances that they\u0027ll come up next time. They\u0027ve got to. They\u0027re not loaded; I kin tell that by the way they roll. He ain\u0027t fingerin\u0027 \u0027em; I stopped that when I made him49 give \u0027em a rollin\u0027 throw, instead o\u0027 keep in\u0027 \u0027em kivvered with the box.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sixteen dollars on the deuce; sixteen dollars on the five-spot. And I ain\u0027t takin\u0027 no chances o\u0027 your jumpin\u0027 the game on me, Mr. Banker. I want you to plank down $32 alongside o\u0027 mine.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty laid down his money and put his fists on it. \"Now put yours right there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, I\u0027ve got money enough to pay you. Don\u0027t be skeered,\" sneered the \"banker,\" \"and you\u0027ll git it if you win it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You bet I will,\" answered Shorty. \"And I\u0027m goin\u0027 to make sure by havin\u0027 it right on the board alongside o\u0027 mine. Come down, now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The proposition met the favor of the other players, and the \"banker\" was constrained to comply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now,\" said Shorty, as the money was counted down, \"I\u0027ve jest $20 more that says that I\u0027ll win. Put her up alongside.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The \"banker\" was game. He pulled out a roll and said as he thumbed it over: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see you $20, and go you $50 better that I win.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty\u0027s heart beat a little faster. All his money was up, but there was the $50 which the Deacon had intrusted to him for charitable purposes. He slipped his hand into his bosom, felt it, and looked at Si. Si was not looking at him, but had his eyes fixed on a part of the board where the dice had been swept after the last throw. Shorty resisted the temptation for a moment, and withdrew his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come down, now,\" taunted the \"banker.\" \"You\u0027ve blowed so much about sand. Don\u0027t weaken over a50 little thing like $50. I\u0027m a thoroughbred, myself, I am. The man don\u0027t live that kin bluff me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The taunt was too much for Shorty. He ran his hand into his bosom in desperation, pulled out the roll of the Deacon\u0027s money, and laid it on the board. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si had not lifted his eyes. He was wondering why the flies showed such a liking for the part of the board where the dice were lying. Numbers of them had gathered there, apparently eagerly feeding. He was trying to understand it. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had been thinking of trying a little shy at the four-spot himself, as he had noticed that it had never won, and two or three times he had looked for it before the dice were put in the box, and had seen the \"banker\" turn it down on the board before picking the dice up. A thought flashed into his mind. \\n\\n \\n\\n The \"banker\" picked up the dice with seeming carelessness, dropped them into the box, gave them a little shake, and rolled them out. Two threes and a six came up. The \"banker\u0027s\" face lighted up with triumph, and Shorty\u0027s deadened into acute despair. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I guess that little change is mine,\" said the \"banker\" reaching for the pile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hold on a minnit. Mister,\" said Si, covering the pile with his massive hands. \"Shorty, look at them dice. He\u0027s got molasses on one side. You kin see there where the flies are eatin\u0027 it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty snatched up the dice, felt them and touched his tongue to one side. \"That\u0027s so, sure\u0027s you\u0027re a foot high,\" said he sententiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n Just then someone yelled: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Scatter! Here come the guards!\"51 \\n\\n \\n\\n All looked up. A company coming at the doublequick was almost upon them. The \"banker\" made a final desperate claw for the money, but was met by the heavy fist of Shorty and knocked on his back. Shorty grabbed what money there was on the board, and he and Si made a burst of speed which took them out of reach of the \"provos\" in a few seconds. Looking back from a safe distance they could see the \"bankers\" and a lot of the more luckless ones being gathered together to march to the guard-house. \"Another detachment of horny-handed laborers for the fortifications,\" said Shorty grimly, as he52 recovered his breath, watched them, and sent up a yell of triumph and derision. \"Another contribution to the charity fund,\" he continued, looking down at the bunch of bills and fractional currency in his hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty Settles With the Banker. 51 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shorty,\" said Si earnestly, \"promise me solemnly that you\u0027ll never bet at chuck-a-luck agin as long as you live.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Si, don\u0027t ask me impossibilities. But I want you to take every cent o\u0027 this money and keep it. Don\u0027t you ever give me more\u0027n $5 at a time, under any consideration. Don\u0027t you do it, if I git down on my knees and ask for it. Lord, how nigh I come to losin\u0027 that $50 o\u0027 your father\u0027s.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63237.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
