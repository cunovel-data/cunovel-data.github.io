{"id":45109,"no":74,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. THE GLORIOUS FOURTH INDEPENDENCE DAY FUN","content":"ON THE BANKS OF ELK RIVER. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"THIS is the glorious Fourth of July,\" remarked Si, as Co. Q broke ranks from reveille roll-call on the banks of Elk River, and he and Shorty turned anxious attention to the problem of getting a satisfactory breakfast out of the scanty materials at their command. \"Up home they\u0027re gittin\u0027 ready for a great time. Yesterday mother and the girls cooked enough goodies to feed the whole company. Mother had Abe Lincoln split up a lot o\u0027 fine, dry hickory. Then she het up the big brick oven out by the Summer-kitchen, and she baked there a lot o\u0027 loaves o\u0027 her splendiferous salt-raisin\u0027 bread, the best in the whole country, if I do say it myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Resemble this, Si?\" asked Shorty, who was pawing around in his shrunken haversack, as he produced two dingy crackers and a handful of pieces, discolored by contact with the coffee and meat during the days of marching in the rain. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And, then,\" continued Si, unmindful of the interruption, \"after she took the bread out, smelling like a bouquet, she put in some biscuits, and then some dressed chicken, a young pig.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just like this,\" echoed Shorty, pulling out a rusty remnant of very fat commissary pork. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shet up, Shorty,\" said Si, angered at this reminder of their meager store, which was all that was left them for the day, since they had far out marched their wagons. \"I won\u0027t have you makin\u0027 fun o\u0027 my mother\u0027s cookin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, you shut up torturing me about home goodies,\" answered Shorty, \"when we hain\u0027t got enough grub here to fill one undivided quarter-section o\u0027 one o\u0027 our gizzards, and there hain\u0027t no more this side o\u0027 the wagons, which are stalled somewhere in the Duck River hills, and won\u0027t be up till the katydids sing. I ain\u0027t making fun o\u0027 your mother\u0027s cookin\u0027. But I won\u0027t have you tormenting me with gas about the goodies back home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know it ain\u0027t right, Shorty,\" said Si. \"It only makes us feel worse. But I can\u0027t help thinkin\u0027—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jest go on thinkin\u0027,\" sneered Shorty, \"if you kin fill yourself up that way. I can\u0027t. You\u0027d better set to studyin\u0027 how to make less\u0027n quarter rations for one fill up two men for all day. There ain\u0027t no use goin\u0027 a-foragin\u0027. They call this country the Cumberland Barrens. There never was grub enough in it to half support the clay-eaters that live around here, and what there was the rebels have carried off. The only thing I kin think of is to cut up some basswood chips and fry with this pork. Mebbe we could make \u0027em soft enough to fill up on.\" And Shorty gloomily shook out the last crumb from the haversacks into a tin of water to soak, while he fried the grease out of the fragment of pork in his half-canteen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And Pap,\" continued Si, as if determined to banish famine thoughts by more agreeable ones, \"has had the trottin\u0027 team nicely curried, and their manes and tails brushed out, and hitched \u0027em to that new Studebaker-spring wagon he wrote about. They\u0027ll put all the good things in, and then mother and the girls\u0027ll climb in. They\u0027ll go down the road in great style, and pick up Annabel, and drive over to the Grove, where they\u0027ll meet all the neighbors, and talk about their boys in the army, and the Posey Brass Band\u0027ll play patriotic tunes, and old Beach Jamieson\u0027ll fire off the anvil, and then Parson Ricketts\u0027ll put on his glasses and read the Declaration o\u0027 Independence, and then some politician young lawyer from Mt. Vernon or Poseyville \u0027ll make a sky-soaring, spread-eagle speech, and—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, do come off, Si,\" said Shorty irritably. \"You\u0027re only making yourself hungrier exercising your tongue so. Come here and git your share o\u0027 the breakfast and mind you eat fair.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty had fried out the pork in the dingy, black half-canteen, poured the soaked crackers into the sputtering hot grease, and given the mess a little further warming and stirring. Then he pulled the half-canteen from the split stick which served for a handle, set it on the ground, and drew a line through it with his spoon to divide the food fairly into equal portions.. \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile Si had strolled over a little ways to where an old worm fence had stood when the regiment went into camp. Now only the chunks at the corners remained. He looked a minute, and then gave a yell of delight. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here, Shorty,\" he called out; \"here\u0027s something that beats your fried breakfasts all holler. Here\u0027s ripe blackberries till you can\u0027t rest, and the biggest, finest ones you ever saw. Come over here, and you can pick all you can eat in five minutes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He began picking and eating with the greatest industry. Shorty walked over and followed his example. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They are certainly the finest blackberries I ever saw,\" he agreed. \"Strange that we didn\u0027t notice them before. This country ain\u0027t no good for nothin\u0027 else, but it surely kin beat the world on blackberries. Hi, there! Git out, you infernal brute!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This latt\u0027er remark was addressed to a long-legged, mangy hound that had suddenly appeared from no where, and was nosing around their breakfast with appreciative sniffs. Shorty made a dive for him, but he cleaned out the half-canteen at one comprehensive gulp, and had put a good-sized farm between him and the fire before Shorty reached it. That gentleman fairly danced with rage, and swore worse than a teamster, but the breakfast was gone beyond recovery. The other boys yelled at and gibed him, but they were careful to do it at a safe distance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Twasn\u0027t much of a breakfast, after all, Shorty,\" said Si, consolingly. \"The crackers was moldly and the pork full o\u0027 maggots, and the Surgeon has warned us time and again against eatin\u0027 them greasy fried messes. All the doctors say that blackberries is very healthy, and they certainly taste nice.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty\u0027s paroxysm of rage expended itself, and he decided it wisest to accept Si\u0027s advice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The berries is certainly fine, Si,\" he said with returning good humor. \"If I could\u0027ve only laid a foundation of crackers and meat I could\u0027ve built a very good breakfast out of \u0027em. I misdoubt, though, whether they\u0027ve got enough substance and stick-to-the-ribs to make a meal out of all by themselves. However, I\u0027ll fill up on \u0027em, and hope they\u0027ll last till a grub-cart gets through. There ought to be one here before noon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One consolation,\" said Si; \"we won\u0027t have to march on this peck. The Adjutant\u0027s just passed the word that we\u0027re to rest here a day or two.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The rest of the regiment were similarly engaged in browsing off the blackberries that grew in wonderful profusion all around, and were really of extraordinary size. After filling themselves as full as possible of the fruit, Si and Shorty secured a couple of camp kettles and gave their garments a boiling that partially revenged themselves upon the insect life of Tennessee for the torments they endured in the Tullahoma campaign. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The better the day the better the deed,\" remarked Shorty, as he and Si stood around the fire, clothed in nothing but their soldierly character, and satisfiedly poked their clothes down in the scalding water. \"Thousands must die that one may be free from graybacks, fleas, and ticks. How could be better celebrated the Fourth of July than by the wholesale slaughter of the tyrants who drain the life-blood of freemen and patriots? Now, that\u0027s a sentiment that would be fine for your orator who is making a speech about this time to your folks in Injianny.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n By this time they were hungry again. The black berries had no staying power in proportion to their filling qualities, and anxiously as they watched the western horizon, no feet of the mules bringing rations had been seen beautiful on the mountains. \\n\\n \\n\\n They went out and filled up again on blackberries, but these seemed to have lost something of their delicious taste of those eaten earlier in the morning. \\n\\n \\n\\n They went back, wrung out their clothes, and put them on again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027ll fit better if they dry on us,\" remarked Shorty. \"And I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ll warp, splinter and check if we are exposed to this sun any longer after all the soakin\u0027 we\u0027ve bin havin\u0027 for the past 10 days.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Comfortably full abdominally, with a delicious sense of relief from the fiendish insects, the sun shining once more brightly in the sky, and elated over the brilliant success of the campaign, they felt as happy as it often comes to men. \\n\\n \\n\\n The scenery was inspiring. Beyond Elk River the romantic Cumberland Mountains raised their picturesque peaks and frowning cliffs into a wondrous cloud-world, where the radiant sunshine and the pearly showers seemed in endless struggle for dominion, with the bright rainbows for war-banners. When the sunshine prevailed, filmy white clouds flags of truce floated lazily from peak to peak, and draped themselves about the rugged rocks. It was an ever-changing panorama of beauty and mystery, gazing on which the eye never wearied. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bragg\u0027s somewhere behind them mountains, Shorty,\" said Si, as the two lay on the ground, smoked, and looked with charmed eyes on the sky line. \"The next job\u0027s to go in there and find him and lick him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care a durn, if it\u0027s only dry weather,\" answered Shorty. \"I kin stand anything but rain. I\u0027d like to soldier awhile in the Sahara Desert for a change. Hello, what\u0027s that? A fight?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A gun had boomed out loudly. The boys pricked up their ears, took their pipes from their mouths and half raised in anticipation of the bugle-call. An other shot followed after an interval, and then a third and fourth. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027re firing a National salute at Division Headquarters in honor of the Fourth of July,\" explained the Orderly-Sergeant. \\n\\n \\n\\n Everybody jumped to his feet and cheered \\n\\n \\n\\n Cheered for the Fourth of July; \\n\\n \\n\\n Cheered for the United States of America; \\n\\n \\n\\n Cheered for President Abraham Lincoln; \\n\\n \\n\\n Cheered for Maj.-Gen. Wm. S. Rosecrans. \\n\\n \\n\\n Cheered for the Army of the Cumberland; \\n\\n \\n\\n Cheered for the Corps Commander; \\n\\n \\n\\n Cheered for the Division Commander; \\n\\n \\n\\n Cheered for the Brigadier-General; \\n\\n \\n\\n Cheered for the Colonel of the 200th Ind.; \\n\\n \\n\\n Cheered for their Royal Selves. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Whew, how hungry that makes me,\" said Shorty as the cheering and the firing ended, and he studied the western horizon anxiously. \"And not a sign yit of any mule-team comin\u0027 up from the rear. They must have religious scruples agin travelin\u0027 on the Fourth o\u0027 July. Well, I s\u0027pose there\u0027s nothin\u0027 to do but hunt up some more blackberries. But blackberries is like mush. They don\u0027t seem to stay with you much longer\u0027n you\u0027re eatin\u0027 \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But they had to go much farther now to find blackberries. The whole hungry regiment had been hunt ing blackberries all day, and for more than a mile around camp the briers were bare. Si and Shorty succeeded at last in finding another plentiful patch, upon which they filled up, and returned to camp for another smoke and an impatient look for the Commissary teams. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I like blackberries as well as any other man,\" mused Shorty, \"but it don\u0027t seem to me that last lot was nearly so good as the first we had this morning. Mebbe the birds kin eat \u0027em four times a day and seven days in the week without gittin\u0027 tired, but I ain\u0027t much of a bird, myself. I\u0027d like to change off just now to about six big crackers, a pound o\u0027 fat pork and a quart o\u0027 coffee. Wonder if the rebel cavalry could\u0027ve got around in our rear and jumped our trains? No; \u0027Joe Wheeler\u0027s critter company,\u0027 as that rebel called \u0027em, hain\u0027t quit runnin\u0027 yit from the lickin\u0027 Minty give \u0027em at Shelbyville. Mebbe the mules have struck. I\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 struck years ago if I\u0027d bin a mule.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The sun began to sink toward the western hills, and still no welcome sign of coming wagons. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si remarked despairingly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, after all the berry-eatin\u0027 I\u0027ve done to-day I feel as holler as a bee-gum. I don\u0027t believe any wagons\u0027ll git up to-night, and if we\u0027re goin\u0027 to have any supper at all we\u0027d better go out and pick it before it gits too dark to see.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They had to go a long distance out this time to find a good berry patch. It was getting dark be fore they fairly began picking their supper. Presently they heard voices approaching from the other side. They crouched down a little behind the brier-clumps and listened. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Be keerful. The Yankee pickets must be nigh. Thar\u0027s their campfires.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pshaw. Them fires is two miles away. Thar\u0027s no pickets fur a mile yit. Go ahead.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No sich thing. Them fires ain\u0027t a mile off. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Their pickets are likely right along that \u0027ere ridge thar.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bushwhackers,\" whispered Si, rising a little to reconnoiter. \"One, two, three, four, five, six on \u0027em. Sneakin\u0027 up to pick off our pickets. What\u0027d we better do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only thing I kin think of,\" whispered Shorty back, feeling around for a stick that would represent a gun, \"is the old trick of ordering \u0027em to surrender. It\u0027s an awful bluff, but we may work it this time. If they\u0027ve got any grit we needn\u0027t worry no more about rations. They\u0027ll git us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si snatched up a piece of rail, and they sprang up together, shouting: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Halt! Surrender! Don\u0027t move a hand or we\u0027ll blow your heads off.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right, Yank. We surrender. Don\u0027t shoot. We\u0027uns \u0027ve bin a-huntin\u0027 yo\u0027uns to gin ourselves up. We\u0027uns is tired o\u0027 the wah.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Bluff Worked 107 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The thunder you do,\" said Si in amazement. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said the leader, walking forward; \"we\u0027uns is plumb sick o\u0027 the wah, and want t\u0027 take the oath and go home. \u0027Deed we\u0027uns do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, you liked to \u0027ve scared two fine young soldiers to death,\" murmured Si under his breath. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Halt, there,\" called out the suspicious Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t come any nearer, or I\u0027ll fire. Stand still, and hold your guns over your heads, till I send a man out to git \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The rebels obediently held their guns in the air. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sergeant,\" commanded Shorty, \"go forward and relieve the men of their arms, while the rest of us keep \u0027em kivvered to prevent treachery and gittin\u0027 the drop on us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si went out and took the guns, one by one, from the hands of the men, and made as good an examination as he could, hastily, to see that they carried nothing else. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lordy, Yank, if you only knowed how powerful glad we\u0027uns is to git to yo\u0027uns, you wouldn\u0027t \u0027spicion us. We\u0027uns \u0027s nigh on to starved t\u0027 death. Hain\u0027t had nothin\u0027 to eat but blackberries for days. And hit\u0027s bin march, march, all the time, right away from we\u0027uns\u0027s homes. Goramighty only knows whar ole Bragg\u0027s a-gwine tuh. Mebbe t\u0027 Cuby. We\u0027uns wuz willin\u0027 t\u0027 fout fur ole Tennessee, but for nary other State. When he started out o\u0027 Tennessee we\u0027uns jest concluded t\u0027 strike out and leave him. Lordy, Mister, hain\u0027t you got something t\u0027 eat? We\u0027uns is jest starvin\u0027 t\u0027 death. \u0027Deed we\u0027uns is.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Awful sorry,\" replied Shorty, as he and Si gathered up the guns and placed themselves behind the group. \"But we hain\u0027t nothin\u0027 to eat ourselves but blackberries, and won\u0027t have till our wagons git up, which \u0027ll be the Lord and Gen. Rosecrans only knows when. You shall have it when we kin git it. Hello, the boys are cheerin\u0027. That means a wagon\u0027s got in. Skip out, now, at a quarter-hoss gait. They may gobble it all up before we git there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Inspired by this, they all started for camp in quick-time. Shorty was right in interpreting the cheering to mean the arrival of a ration-wagon. \\n\\n \\n\\n When they reached Co. Q they found the Orderly-Sergeant standing over a half-box of crackers. \\n\\n \\n\\n Around him was gathered the company in a petulant state of mind. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cuss and swear, boys, all you\u0027ve a mind to,\" he was saying, \"if you think that\u0027ll swell your grub. You know it won\u0027t. Only one wagon\u0027s come up, and it had only a half-load. Our share in it is what you see here. I figure that there\u0027s just about one cracker apiece for you, and as I call your names you\u0027ll step up and get it. Don\u0027t swear at me. I\u0027ve done the best I could. Cuss the Tennessee mud and freshets in the cricks all you want to, if you think that\u0027ll fill your crops, but let me alone, or I\u0027ll bust somebody.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve my opinion o\u0027 the glorious Fourth o\u0027 July,\" said Shorty, as he nibbled moodily at his solitary cracker. \"I\u0027ll change my politics and vote for Thanksgiving Day and Christmas after this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I think that we\u0027ve had a pretty fine Fourth,\" said the more cheerful Si. \"For once in my life I\u0027ve had all the blackberries I could eat, and otherwise it\u0027s a pleasant day. Them deserters gave me a cold chill at first, but I\u0027m glad we got \u0027em. There\u0027ll certainly be more wagons up to-night, and to-morrow we\u0027ll have all we kin eat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And that night, for the first in 10 days, they slept under dry blankets. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63261.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
