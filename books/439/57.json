{"id":45092,"no":57,"title":"CHAPTER X. TRADING WITH THE REBS","content":"THE BOYS HAVE SOME FRIENDLY COMMERCE WITH THE REBEL PICKETS. THE 200th Ind. Volunteer Infantry had been pushed out to watch the crossings of Duck River and the movements of the rebels on the south bank of that narrow stream. The rebels, who had fallen into the incurable habit of objecting to everything that the \"Yankees\" did, seemed to have especial and vindictive repugnance to being watched. Probably no man, except he be an actor or a politician, likes to be watched, but few ever showed themselves as spitefully resentful of observation as the rebels. Co. Q was advanced to picket the north bank of the river, but the moment it reached the top of the hill overlooking the stream it had to deploy as skirmishers, and Enfield bullets began to sing viciously about its ears. \"Looks as if them fellers think we want to steal their old river and send it North,\" said Shorty, as he reloaded his gun after firing at a puff of smoke that had come out of the sumach bushes along the fence at the foot of the hill. \"They needn\u0027t be so grouchy. We don\u0027t want their river—only to use it awhile. They kin have it back agin after we\u0027re through with it.\" \"Blamed if that feller didn\u0027t make a good line137 shot,\" said Si, glancing up just above his head to where a twig had been clipped off the persimmon tree behind which he was standing. \"He put up his sights a little too fur, or he\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 got me.\" Si took careful aim at where he supposed the lurking marksman to be and fired. There was a waving of the tops of the bushes, as if the men concealed there had rushed out. \"Guess we both landed mighty close,\" said Shorty triumphantly. \"They seem to have lost interest in this piece o\u0027 sidehill, anyway.\" He and Si made a rush down the hill, and gained the covert of the fence just in time to see the rails splintered by a bunch of shots striking them. \"Lay down, Yanks!\" called out Shorty cheerily, dropping into the weeds. \"Grab a root!\" To the right of them they could see the rest of Co. Q going through similar performances. Si and Shorty pushed the weeds aside, crawled cautiously to the fence, and looked through. There was a road on the other side of the fence, and beyond it a grove of large beech trees extending to the bank of the river. Half concealed by the trunk of one of these stood a tall, rather good-looking young man, with his gun raised and intently peering into the bushes. He had seen the tops stir, and knew that his enemies had gained their cover. He seemed expecting that they would climb the fence and jump down into the road. At a little distance to his right could be seen other men on the sharp lookout. Shorty put his hand on Si to caution and repress138 him. With his eyes fixed on the rebel, Shorty drew his gun toward him. The hammer caught on a trailing vine, and, forgetting himself, he gave it an impatient jerk. It went off, the bullet whistling past Shorty\u0027s head and the powder burning his face. The rebel instantly fired in return, and cut the leaves about four feet above Shorty. \"Purty good shot that, Johnny,\" called out Shorty as he reloaded his gun; \"but too low. It went between my legs. You hain\u0027t no idee how tall I am.\" \"If I couldn\u0027t shoot no better\u0027n you kin on a sneak,\" answered the rebel, his rammer ringing in his gun-barrel, \"I wouldn\u0027t handle firearms. Your bullet went a mile over my head. Must\u0027ve bin shootin\u0027 at an angel. But you Yanks can\u0027t shoot nary bit—you\u0027re too skeered.\" \"I made you hump out o\u0027 the bushes a few minutes ago,\" replied Shorty, putting on a cap. \"Who was skeered then? You struck for tall timber like a cotton-tailed rabbit.\" \"I\u0027ll rabbit ye, ye nigger-lovin\u0027 whelp,\" shouted the rebel. \"Take that,\" and he fired as close as he could to the sound of Shorty\u0027s voice. Shorty had tried to anticipate his motion and fired first, but the limbs bothered his aim, and his bullet went a foot to the right of the rebel\u0027s head. It was close enough, however, to make the rebel cover himself carefully with the tree. \"That was a much better shot, Yank,\" he called out. \"But ye orter do a powerful sight better\u0027n that on a sneak. Ye\u0027d never kill no deer, nor rebels nuthor, with that kind o\u0027 shootin\u0027. You Yanks are139 great on the sneak, but that\u0027s all the good it does, yet ye can\u0027t shoot fer a handful o\u0027 huckleberries.\" \"Sneaks! Can\u0027t shoot!\" roared Shorty. \"I kin outshoot you or any other man in Jeff Davis\u0027s kingdom. I dare you to come out from behind your tree, and take a shot with me in the open, accordin\u0027 to Hardee\u0027s tactics. Your gun\u0027s empty; so\u0027s mine. My chum here\u0027ll see fair play; and you kin bring your chum with you. Come out, you skulkin\u0027 brindle pup, and shoot man fashion, if you dare.\"140 \"Ye can\u0027t dare me, ye nigger-stealin\u0027 blue-belly,\" shouted the rebel in return, coming out from behind his tree. Shorty climbed over the fence and stood at the edge of the road, with his gun at order arms. Si came out on Shorty\u0027s left, and a rebel appeared to the right of the first. For a minute all stood in expectancy. Then Shorty spoke: \"I want nuthin\u0027 but what\u0027s fair. Your gun\u0027s empty; so\u0027s mine. You probably know Hardee\u0027s tactics as well as I do.\" \"I\u0027m up in Hardee,\" said the rebel with a firm voice. \"Well, then,\" continued Shorty, \"let my chum here call off the orders for loadin\u0027 and firin\u0027, and we\u0027ll both go through \u0027em, and shoot at the word.\" \"Go ahead—I\u0027m agreed,\" said the rebel briefly. Shorty nodded to Si. \"Carry arms,\" commanded Si. Both brought their guns up to their right sides. \"Present arms.\" Both courteously saluted. \"Load in nine times—Load,\" ordered Si. Both guns came down at the same instant, each man grasped his muzzle with his left hand, and reached for his cartridge-box, awaiting the next order. \"Handle cartridges.\" \"Tear cartridges.\" \"Charge cartridges,\" repeated Si slowly and distinctly. The rebel\u0027s second nodded approval of his knowledge of the drill, and sang out: \"Good soldiers, all of yo\u0027uns.\" \"Draw rammer,\" continued Si,141 \"Turn rammer.\" \"Ram cartridge.\" Shorty punctiliously executed the three blows on the cartridge exacted by the regulations, and paused a breath for the next word. The rebel had sent his cartridge home with one strong thrust, but he saw his opponent\u0027s act and waited. \"Return rammer,\" commanded Si. He was getting a little nervous, but Shorty deliberately withdrew his rammer, turned it, placed one end in the thimbles, deliberately covered the head with his little finger, exactly as the tactics prescribed, and sent it home with a single movement. The rebel had a little trouble in returning rammer, and Shorty and Si waited. \"Cast about,\" \"Prime!\" Both men capped at the same instant. \"Ready!\" Shorty cocked his piece and glanced at the rebel, whose gun was at his side. \"Aim!\" Both guns came up like a flash. The Duel. 139 Si\u0027s heart began thumping at a terrible rate. He was far more alarmed about Shorty than he had ever been about himself. Up to this moment he had hoped that Shorty\u0027s coolness and deliberation would \"rattle\" the rebel and make him fire wildly. But the latter, as Si expressed it afterward, \"seemed to be made of mighty good stuff,\" and it looked as if both would be shot down. \"Fire!\" shouted Si, with a perceptible tremor in his voice.142 Both guns flashed at the same instant. Si saw Shorty\u0027s hat fly off, and him stagger and fall, while the rebel dropped his gun, and clapped his hand to his side. Si ran toward Shorty, who instantly sprang up again, rubbing his head, from which came a faint trickle of blood. \"He aimed at my head, and jest scraped my scalp,\" he said. \"Where\u0027d I hit him? I aimed at his heart, and had a good bead.\" \"You seem to have struck him in the side,\" answered Si, looking at the rebel. \"But not badly, for he\u0027s still standin\u0027 up. Mebbe you broke a rib though.\" \"Couldn\u0027t, if he\u0027s still up. I must file my trigger Gun pulls too hard. I had a dead aim on his heart, but I seem to\u0027ve pulled too much to the right.\" \"Say, I\u0027ll take a turn with you,\" said Si, picking up his gun and motioning with his left hand at the other rebel. \"All right,\" answered the other promptly. \"My gun ain\u0027t loaded, though.\" \"I\u0027ll wait for you,\" said Si, looking at the cap on his gun. A loud cheer was heard from far to the right, and Co. Q was seen coming forward on a rush, with the rebels in front running back to the river bank. Several were seen to be overtaken and forced to surrender. The two rebels in front of the boys gave a startled look at their comrades, then at the boys, and turned to run. Si raised his gun to order them to halt. \"No,\" said Shorty. \"Let \u0027em go. It was a fair bargain, and I\u0027ll stick to it. Skip out Johnnies, for every cent you\u0027re worth.\"143 The rebels did not wait for the conclusion of the sentence, but followed their comrades with alacrity. The boys ran forward through the woods to the edge of the bank, and saw their opponents climbing up the opposite bank and getting behind the sheltering trees. Si waited till his particular one got good shelter behind a large sycamore, and then sent a bullet that cut closely above his head. This was the signal for a general and spiteful fusillade from both sides of the river and all along the line. The rebels banged away as if in red-hot wrath at being run across the stream, and Co. Q retorted with such earnestness that another company was sent forward to its assistance, but returned when the Irish Lieutenant, who had gone forward to investigate, reported: \"Faith, its loike the divil shearing a hog—all cry and no wool at all.\" So it was. Both sides found complete shelter behind the giant trunks of the trees, and each fired at insignificant portions of the anatomy allowed to momentarily protrude beyond the impenetrable boles. After this had gone on for about half an hour those across the river from Si and Shorty called out: \"Say, Yanks, ye can\u0027t shoot down a beech tree with a Springfield musket, nohow ye kin do it. If we\u0027uns hain\u0027t killin\u0027 more o\u0027 yo\u0027uns than yo\u0027uns is a-killin\u0027 o\u0027 we\u0027uns, we\u0027uns air both wastin\u0027 a powerful lot o\u0027 powder an\u0027 lead and good shootin\u0027. What d\u0027 yo\u0027uns say to King\u0027s excuse for awhile?\" \"We\u0027re agreed,\" said Si promptly, stepping from144 behind the tree, and leaving his gun standing against it. \"Hit\u0027s a go,\" responded the rebels, coming out disarmed. \"We\u0027uns won\u0027t shoot no more till ordered, an\u0027 then\u0027ll give yo\u0027uns warnin\u0027 fust.\" The Overture for Trade. 144 \"All right; we\u0027ll give you warning before we shoot,\" coincided Si. \"Say, have yo\u0027uns got any Yankee coffee that145 you\u0027ll trade for a good plug o\u0027 terbacker?\" inquired the man whom Si had regarded as his particular antagonist. \"Yes,\" answered Si. \"We\u0027ve got a little. We\u0027ll give you a cupful for a long plug with none cut off.\" \"What kind of a cupful?\" asked the bartering \"Johnny.\" \"A big, honest cupful. One o\u0027 this kind,\" said Si, showing his. \"All right. Hit\u0027s to be strike measure,\" said the rebel. \"Here\u0027s the plug,\" and he held up a long plug of \"natural leaf.\" \"O. K.,\" responded Si. \"Meet me half way.\" The truce had quickly extended, and the firing suspended all along the line of Co. Q. The men came out from behind their trees, and sat down on the banks in open view of one another. Si filled his cup \"heaping-full\" with coffee, climbed down the bank and waded out into the middle of the water. The rebel met him there, while his companion and Shorty stood on the banks above and watched the trade. \"Y\u0027re givin\u0027 me honest measure, Yank,\" said the rebel, looking at the cup. \"Now, if ye hain\u0027t filled the bottom o\u0027 yer cup with coffee that\u0027s bin biled before, I\u0027ll say y\u0027re all right. Some o\u0027 yo\u0027uns air so dod-gasted smart that y\u0027 poke off on we\u0027uns coffee that\u0027s bin already biled, and swindle we\u0027uns.\" \"Turn it out and see,\" said Si. The rebel emptied the cup into a little bag, carefully scrutinizing the stream as it ran in. It was all fine, fragrant, roasted and ground coffee.146 \"Lord, thar\u0027s enough t\u0027 last me a month with keer,\" said the rebel, gazing unctuously at the rich brown grains. \"I won\u0027t use more\u0027n a spoonful a day, an\u0027 bile hit over twice. Yank, here\u0027s yer terbacker. I\u0027ve made a good trade. Here\u0027s a Chatanooga paper I\u0027ll throw in to boot. Got a Northern paper about ye anywhar?\" Si produced a somewhat frayed Cincinnati Gazette. \"I can\u0027t read myself,\" said the rebel, as he tucked the paper away. \"Never l\u0027arned to. Pap wuz agin hit. Said hit made men lazy. He got erlong without readin\u0027, and raised the biggest fambly on Possum Crick. But thar\u0027s a feller in my mess kin read everything but the big words, and I like t\u0027 git a paper for him to read to the rest o\u0027 we\u0027uns.\" \"Was your pardner badly hurt by mine\u0027s shot?\" asked Si. \"No. The bullet jest scraped the bone. He\u0027ll be likely to have a stitch in his side for awhile, but he\u0027s a very peart man, and won\u0027t mind that. I\u0027m s\u0027prised he didn\u0027t lay your pardner out. He\u0027s the best shot in our company.\" \"Well, he was buckin\u0027 agin a mighty good shot, and I\u0027m surprised your pardner\u0027s alive. I wouldn\u0027t \u0027ve given three cents for him when Shorty drawed down on him; but Shorty\u0027s bin off duty for awhile, and his gun\u0027s not in the best order. Howsumever, I\u0027m awful glad that it come out as it did. His life\u0027s worth a dozen rebels.\" \"The blazes you say. I\u0027d have you know, Yank, that one Confederit is wuth a whole rijimint o\u0027 Lincoln hirelings. I\u0027ll—\"147 \"O, come off—come off—that\u0027s more o\u0027 your old five-to-one gas,\" said Si irritatingly. \"I thought we\u0027d walloped that dumbed nonsense out o\u0027 your heads long ago. We\u0027ve showed right along that, man for man, we\u0027re a sight better\u0027n you. We\u0027ve always licked you when we\u0027ve had anything like a fair show. At Stone River you had easy two men to our one, and yit we got away with you.\" \"\u0027Tain\u0027t so. It\u0027s a lie. If hit wuzzent for the148 Dutch and Irish you hire, you couldn\u0027t fight we\u0027uns at all.\" \"Look here, reb,\" said Si, getting hot around the ears, \"I\u0027m neither a Dutchman nor an Irishman; we hain\u0027t a half dozen in our company. I\u0027m a better man than you\u0027ve got in your regiment. Either me or Shorty kin lick any man you put up; Co. Q kin lick your company single-handed and easy; the 200th Injianny kin lick any regiment in the rebel army. To prove it, I kin lick you right here.\" Si Wants a Fight 147 Si thrust the plug of tobacco into his blouse pocket and began rolling up his sleeves. The rebel did not seem at all averse to the trial and squared off at him. Then Shorty saw the belligerent attitude and yelled: \"Come, Si. Don\u0027t fight there. That\u0027s no place. If you\u0027re goin\u0027 to fight, come up on level ground, where it kin be fair and square. Come up here, or we\u0027ll go over there.\" \"O, come off,\" shouted the rebel on the other side. \"Don\u0027t be a fool, Bill. Fist-foutin\u0027 don\u0027t settle nothin\u0027. Come back here and git your gun if ye want to fout. But don\u0027t le\u0027s fout no more to-day. Thar\u0027s plenty of it for ter-morrer. Le\u0027s keep quiet and peaceful now. I want powerfully to take a swim. Air you fellers agreed?\" \"Yes; yes,\" shouted Shorty. \"You fellers keep to your side o\u0027 the river, and we will to ours.\" The agreement was carried into instantaneous effect, and soon both sides of the stream were filled with laughing, romping, splashing men. There was something very exhilarating in the cool, clear, mountain water of the stream. The boys149 got to wrestling, and Si came off victorious in two or three bouts with his comrades. \"Cock-a-doodle-doo,\" he shouted, imitating the crow of a rooster. \"I kin duck any man in the 200th Injianny.\" The challenge reached the ears of the rebel with whom Si had traded. He was not satisfied with the result of his conference. \"You kin crow over your fellers, Yank,\" he shouted; \"but you dassent come to the middle an\u0027 try me two falls outen three.\" Si immediately made toward him. They surveyed each other warily for a minute to get the advantages of the first clinch, when a yell came from the rebel side: \"Scatter, Confeds! Hunt yer holes, Yanks! The Cunnel\u0027s a-comin\u0027.\" Both sides ran up their respective banks, snatched up their guns, took their places behind their trees, and opened a noisy but harmless fire.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63244.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
