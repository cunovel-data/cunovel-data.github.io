{"id":45096,"no":61,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. SHORTY HAS AN ADVENTURE WITH SI","content":"HE GOES OUT TO VISIT MRS. BOLSTER. \n \n SHORTY sauntered thoughtfully back to the tent, and on the way decided to tell Si the whole occurrence, not even omitting the deceit practiced. \n \n He had to admit to himself that he was unaccountably shaken up by the affair. \n \n Si was so deeply interested in the revelations that he forgot to blame Shorty\u0027s double-dealing. \n \n \"Never had my nerve so strained before,\" Shorty frankly admitted. \"At their best, women are curiouser than transmogrified hullaloos, and when a real cute one sets out to hornswoggle a man he might as well lay down and give right up, for he hain\u0027t no earthly show. She gits away with him every time, and one to spare. That there woman\u0027s got the devil in her bigger\u0027n a sheep, and she come nigher makin\u0027 putty o\u0027 your Uncle Ephraim than I ever dreamed of before. It makes me shivery to think about it.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t care if she\u0027s more devils in her than the Gadarene swine, she must be stopped at once,\" said Si, his patriotic zeal flaming up. \"She\u0027s doin\u0027 more mischief than a whole regiment o\u0027 rebels, and must be busted immediately. We\u0027ve got to stop193 her.\" \n \n \"But just how are we goin\u0027 to stop her?\" Shorty asked. There was a weak unreadiness in Shorty\u0027s tones that made Si look at him in surprise. Never before, in any emergency, had there been the slightest shade of such a thing in his bold, self-reliant partner\u0027s voice. \n \n \"I\u0027d rather tackle any two men there are in the Southern Confederacy than that woman,\" said Shorty. \"I believe she put a spell on me.\" \n \n \"Le\u0027s go up and talk to Capt. McGillicuddy about it,\" said Si. Ordinarily, this was the last thing that either of them would have thought of doing. Their usual disposition was to go ahead and settle the problem before them in their own way, and report about it afterward. But Shorty was clearly demoralized. \n \n Capt. McGillicuddy listened very gravely to their story. \n \n \"Evidently that old hen has a nest of bad, dangerous men, which has to be broken up,\" he said. \"We can get the whole raft if we go about it in the right way, but we\u0027ve got to be mighty smart in dealing with them, or they\u0027ll fly the coop, and leave the laugh on us. You say she\u0027s coming back to-morrow?\" \n \n \"Yes,\" said Shorty, with a perceptible shiver. \n \n \"Well, I want you to fall right in with all her plans—both of you. Pretend to be anxious to desert, or anything else that she may propose. Go back home with her. I shall watch you carefully, but without seeming to, and follow you with a squad big enough to take care of anything that may be out there. Go back to your tent now, and think it194 all over, and arrange some signal to let me know when you want me to jump the outfit.\" \n \n The boys went back to their tent, and spent an hour in anxious consideration of their plans. Si saw the opportunity to render a great service, and was eager to perform it, but he firmly refused to tell any lies to the woman or those around her. He would not say that he was tired of the service and wanted to desert; he would not pretend liking for the Southern Confederacy or the rebels, nor hatred to his own people. He would do nothing but go along, share all the dangers with Shorty, and be ready at the moment to co-operate in breaking up the gang. \n \n \"Some folks\u0027s so durned straight that they lean over backwards,\" said Shorty impatiently. \"What in thunder does it amount to what you tell these onery gallinippers? They\u0027ll lie to you as fast as a hoss kin trot. There\u0027s no devilment they won\u0027t do, and there kin be nothin\u0027 wrong in anything you kin do and say to them.\" \n \n \"Everybody settles some things for himself,\" said the unchangeable Si. \"I believe them folks are as bad as they kin be made. I believe every one o\u0027 \u0027em ought to be killed, and if it wuz orders to kill \u0027em I\u0027d kill without turnin\u0027 a hair. But I jest simply won\u0027t lie to nobody, I don\u0027t care who he is. I\u0027ll stand by you until the last drop; you kin tell \u0027em what you please, but I won\u0027t tell \u0027em nothin\u0027, except that they\u0027re a pizen gang, and ought t\u0027ve bin roastin\u0027 in brimstone long ago.\" \n \n \"But,\" expostulated Shorty, \"if you only go along with me you\u0027re actin\u0027 a lie. If you go out o\u0027 camp with mo you\u0027ll pretend to bo desertin\u0027 and j\u0027inin\u0027 in195 with \u0027em. Seems to me that\u0027s jest as bad as tellin\u0027 a lie straight out.\" \n \n \"Well,\" said the immovable Si, \"I draw the line there. I\u0027ll go along with you, and they kin think what they like. But if I say anything to \u0027em, they\u0027ll git it mighty straight.\" \n \n \"Well, I don\u0027t know but, after all, we kin better arrange it that way,\" said Shorty, after he had thought it over in silence for some time. \"I\u0027m sure that if you\u0027d talk you\u0027d give us dead away. That clumsy basswood tongue o\u0027 your\u0027n hain\u0027t any suppleness, and you\u0027d be sure to blurt out something that\u0027d jest ruin us. An idee occurs to me. You jest go along, look sour and say nothin\u0027. I\u0027ll tell \u0027em you ketched cold the other night and lost your speech. It\u0027ll give me a turn o\u0027 extra dooty talkin\u0027 for two, but I guess I kin do it.\" \n \n \"All right,\" agreed Si. \"Let it go that way.\" \n \n \"Now, look here, Si,\" said Shorty, in a low, mysterious tone, \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to tell you somethin\u0027 that I hadn\u0027t intended to. I\u0027m scared to death lest that old hag\u0027ll git the drop on me some way and marry me right out of hand. I tell you, she jest frightens the life out o\u0027 me. That worries me more\u0027n all the rest put together. I expect I ought t \u0027v\u0027 told you so at the very first.\" \n \n \"Nonsense,\" said Si contemptuously. \"The idee o\u0027 you\u0027re being afeared o\u0027 such a thing.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s all very well for you to snort and laugh, Si Klegg,\" persisted Shorty. \"You don\u0027t know her. I sneered at her, too, at first, but when I was left alone with her she seemed to mesmerize me. I found myself talkin\u0027 about marryin\u0027 her before I knowed196 it, and the next thing I was on the p\u0027int o\u0027 actually marryin\u0027 her. I believe that if she\u0027d got me to walk a half-mile further with her she\u0027d a run me up agin a Justice o\u0027 the Peace and married me in spite of all that I could do. I\u0027d much ruther have my head blowed off than married to that old catamount. \n \n \"Bah, you can\u0027t marry folks unless both are willin\u0027,\" insisted Si. \"A man can\u0027t have a marriage rung in on him willy-nilly.\" \n \n \"There\u0027s just where you\u0027re shootin\u0027 off your mouth without any sense. You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talkin\u0027 about. Men are lassoed every day and married to women that they\u0027d run away from like a dog from a porcupine, if they could. You jest look around among the married folks you know, and see how many there are that wouldn\u0027t have married one another if they\u0027d bin in their senses.\" \n \n \"Well, I don\u0027t think o\u0027 many,\" said Si, whose remembrances were that the people in Posey County seemed generally well-mated. \n \n \"Well, there mayn\u0027t be many, but there\u0027s some, and I don\u0027t propose to be one of \u0027em. There\u0027s some spell or witchcraft about it. I\u0027ve read in books about things that gave a woman power to marry any man she wanted to, and he couldn\u0027t help himself. That woman\u0027s got something o\u0027 that kind, and she\u0027s set her eye on me. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to meet her, and I want to help break up her gang, but I\u0027d a great deal rather tackle old Bragg and his entire army. I want you to stay right by me every minnit, and keep your eye on me when she\u0027s near me.\"197 \n \n \"All right,\" said Si sleepily, as he crawled into bed. \n \n The next morning, as they were discussing the question of signals, they happened to pass the Sutler\u0027s, and Si caught a glimpse of packages of firecrackers, which the regimental purveyor had, for some inscrutable reason, thought he might sell. An idea occurred to Si, and he bought a couple of packages, and stowed them away in his blouse pocket and told the Captain that their firing would be the signal, unless a musket-shot should come first. \n \n It was yet early in the forenoon as they walked on the less-frequented side of the camp. Shorty gave a start, and gasped: \n \n \"Jewhilikins, there she is already.\" \n \n Si looked, and saw Mrs. Bolster striding toward them. Shorty hung back instinctively for an instant, and then braced up and bade her good morning. \n \n She grunted an acknowledgment, and said rather imperiously: \n \n \"Y\u0027re a-gwine, air yo\u0027?\" \n \n \"Certainly,\" answered Shorty. \n \n \"And yo\u0027?\" she inquired, looking at Si. \n \n \"He\u0027s a-goin\u0027, too,\" answered Shorty. \"Mustn\u0027t expect him to talk. He\u0027s short on tongue this mornin\u0027. Ketched a bad cold night before last. Settled on his word-mill. Unjinted his clapper. Can\u0027t speak a word. Doctor says it will last several days. Not a great affliction. Couldn\u0027t \u0027ve lost anything o\u0027 less account.\" \n \n \"Must\u0027ve bin an orful cold,\" said she, taking her pipe from her mouth and eyeing Si suspiciously.198 \n \n \"Never knowed a cold to shut off any one\u0027s gab afore. Seems t\u0027 me that hit makes people talk more. But these Yankees air different. Whar air yer things? Did yo\u0027 bring plenty o\u0027 coffee?\u0027 \n \n \"We\u0027ve got \u0027em hid down here in the brush,\" said Shorty. \"We\u0027ll git \u0027em when we\u0027re ready to start.\" \n \n \"We\u0027re ready now,\" she answered. \"Come along.\" \n \n \"But we hain\u0027t no passes,\" objected Shorty. \"We must go to the Captain and git passes.\" \n \n \"Yo\u0027 won\u0027t need no passes,\" she said impatiently. \"Foller me.\" \n \n Shorty had expected to make the pretext about the passes serve for informing Capt. McGillicuddy of the presence of the woman in the camp. He looked quickly around and saw the Captain sauntering carelessly at a little distance, so that any notification was unnecessary. He turned and followed Mrs. Bolster\u0027s long strides, with Si bringing up the rear. \n \n They went to the clump of brush where they had hidden their haversacks and guns. Mrs. Bolster eagerly examined the precious package of coffee. \n \n \"I\u0027ll take keer o\u0027 this myself,\" she said, stowing it away about her lanky person. \"I can\u0027t afford to take no resks as to hit.\" \n \n Si and Shorty had thought themselves very familiar with the campground, but they were astonished to find themselves led outside the line without passing under the eye of a single guard. Si looked at Shorty in amazement, and Shorty remarked: \n \n \"Well, I\u0027ll be durned.\" \n \n The woman noticed and understood. \"Yo\u0027 Yanks,\"199 she said scornfully, \"think yourselves moughty smart with all your book-larnin\u0027, and yo\u0027uns put on heaps o\u0027 airs over po\u0027 folks what hain\u0027t no eddication; but what you don\u0027t know about Tennessee woods would make a bigger book than ever was printed.\" \n \n \"I believe you,\" said Shorty fervently. His superstition in regard to her was rapidly augmenting to that point where he believed her capable of anything. He was alarmed a\u0027bout Capt. McGillicuddy\u0027s being able to follow their mysterious movements. But they soon came to the road, and looking back from the top of a hill, Shorty\u0027s heart lightened as he saw a squad moving out which he was confident was led by Capt. McGillicuddy. \n \n But little had been said so far. At a turn of the road they came upon a gray-bearded man, wearing a battered silk hat and spectacles, whom Mrs. Bolster greeted as \"\u0027Squire.\" \n \n The word seemed to send all the blood from Shorty\u0027s face, and he looked appealingly to Si as if the crisis had come. \n \n The newcomer looked them over sharply and inquired: \n \n \"Who are these men, Mrs. Bolster?\" \n \n \"They\u0027uns \u0027s all right. They\u0027uns \u0027s had enough o\u0027 Abolition doin\u0027s, and hev come over whar they\u0027uns allers rayly belonged. This one is a partickler friend o\u0027 mine,\" and she leered at Shorty in a way that made his blood run cold. \n \n \"Hain\u0027t yo\u0027 time t\u0027 stop a minute, \u0027Squire?\" she asked appealingly, as the newcomer turned his horse\u0027s head to renew his journey.200 \n \n \"Not now; not now,\" answered the \u0027Squire, digging his heels into his steed\u0027s side. \"I want to talk t\u0027 yo\u0027 and these \u0027ere men \u0027bout what\u0027s gwine on in the Lincoln camps, but I must hurry on now to meet Capt. Solomon at the Winding Blades. I\u0027ll come over to your house this evening,\" he called back. \n \n \"Don\u0027t fail, \u0027Squire,\" she answered, \"fur I\u0027ve got a little job for yo\u0027, an\u0027 I want hit partickerly done this very evenin\u0027. Hit can\u0027t wait.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll be there without fail,\" he assured her. \n \n \"Capt. Solomon\u0027s the man what sent the letter to you,\" she explained, which somewhat raised Shorty\u0027s depressed heart, for he began to have hopes that Rosenbaum might rescue him if Capt. McGillicuddy should be behind time. \n \n As they jogged onward farther from camp Mrs. Bolster\u0027s saturnine earnestness began to be succeeded by what were intended to be demonstrations of playful affection for her future husband, whom she now began to regard as securely hers. She would draw Shorty into the path a little ahead of Si, and walk alongside of him, pinching his arm and jabbering incoherent words which were meant for terms of endearment. When the narrowness of the road made them walk in single file she would come up from time to time alongside with cuffs intended for playful love-taps. \n \n At each of these Shorty would cast such a look of wretchedness at Si that the latter had difficulty in preserving his steadfast silence and rigidity of countenance. \n \n But the woman\u0027s chief affection seemed to be called forth by the package of coffee. She would201 stop in the midst of any demonstration to pull out the bag containing the fragrant berry, and lovingly inhale its odor. \n \n It was long past noon when she announced: \"Thar\u0027s my house right ahead.\" She followed this up with a ringing whoopee, which made the tumbledown cabin suddenly swarm with animation. A legion of loud-mouthed dogs charged down toward the road. Children of various ages, but of no variety in their rags and unkempt wildness, followed the dogs, or perched upon the fence-corners and stumps, and three or four shambling, evil-faced mountaineers lunged forward, guns in hand, with eyes fiercer than the dogs, as they looked over the two armed soldiers. \n \n \"They\u0027uns is all right, boys,\" exclaimed the woman. \"They\u0027uns \u0027s plum sick o\u0027 doggin\u0027 hit for Abe Lincoln an\u0027 quit.\" \n \n \"Let \u0027em gin up thar guns, then,\" said the foremost man, who had but one eye, reaching for Shorty\u0027s musket. \"I\u0027ll take this one. I\u0027ve been longin\u0027 for a good Yankee gun for a plum month to reach them Yankee pickets on Duck River.\" \n \n Though Shorty and Si had schooled themselves in the part they were to play, the repugnant thought of giving up their arms to the rebels threatened to overset everything. Instinctively they threw up their guns to knock over the impudent guerrillas. The woman strode between them and the others, and caught hold of their muskets. \n \n \"Don\u0027t be fools. Let \u0027em have your guns,\" she said, and she caught Si\u0027s with such quick unexpectedness that she wrenched it from his grasp and flung202 it to the man who wanted Shorty\u0027s. She threw one arm around Shorty\u0027s neck, with a hug so muscular that his breath failed, and she wrenched his gun away. She kept this in her hand, however. \n \n \"Now, I want these \u0027ere men treated right,\" she announced to the others, \"and I\u0027m a-gwine to have \u0027em treated right, or I\u0027ll bust somebody\u0027s skillet. They\u0027uns is my takings, and I\u0027m a-gwine to have all the say \u0027bout \u0027em. I\u0027ve never interfered with any Yankees any o\u0027 yo\u0027uns have brung in. Yo\u0027ve done with them as you pleased, an\u0027 I\u0027m a-gwine to do with these jest as I please, and yo\u0027uns that don\u0027t like hit kin jest lump hit, that\u0027s all.\" \n \n Take Your Arm from Around That Yank\u0027s Neck 203 \n \n \"\u0027Frony Bolster, I want yo\u0027 to take yo\u0027r arms from around that Yank\u0027s neck,\" said the man who had tried to take Shorty\u0027s gun. \"I won\u0027t \u0027low yo\u0027 to put yo\u0027r arm \u0027round another man\u0027s neck as long\u0027s I\u0027m alive to stop it.\" \n \n \"Ye won\u0027t, Jeff Hackberry,\" she sneered. \"Jealous, air ye? You\u0027ve got no bizniss o\u0027 bein\u0027. Done tole ye \u0027long ago I\u0027d never marry yo\u0027, so long as I could find a man who has two good eyes and a \u0027spectable character. I\u0027ve done found him. Here he is, and \u0027Squire Corson \u0027ll splice us to-night.\" \n \n How much of each of the emotions of jealousy, disappointment, hurt vanity, and rebel antagonism went into the howl that Mr. Jeff Hackberry set up at this announcement will never be known. He made a rush with clenched fists at Shorty. \n \n A better description could be given of the operations of the center of a tornado than of the events of the next few minutes. Shorty and Hackberry grappled fiercely. Mrs. Bolster mixed in to stop the fight and save Shorty. Si and the other three rebels flung themselves into the whirlpool of strikes, kicks, and grapples. The delighted children came rushing in, and eagerly joined the fray, striking with charming impartiality at every opportunity to get a lick in anywhere on anybody; and finally the legion of dogs, to whom such scenes seemed familiar and gladsome, rushed in with an ear-splitting clamor, and jumped and bit at the arms and legs that went flying around.204 \n \n This was too violent to last long. Everybody and everything had to stop from sheer exhaustion. But when the stop came Mrs. Bolster was sitting on the prostrate form of Jeff Hackberry. The others were disentangling themselves from one another, the children and the dogs, and apparently trying to get themselves into relation with the points of the compass and understand what had been happening. \n \n \"Have yo\u0027 had enough, Jeff Hackberry,\" inquired Mrs. Bolster, \"or will yo\u0027 obleege me to gouge yer other eye out afore yo\u0027 come to yer senses?\" \n \n \"Le\u0027 me up, \u0027Frony,\" pleaded the man, \"an\u0027 then we kin talk this thing over.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63248.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
