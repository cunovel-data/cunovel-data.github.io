{"id":45127,"no":92,"title":"CHAPTER V. TROUBLE ENCOUNTERED","content":"THE BOYS MEET AN OLD FRIEND AND ARE TAKEN HOME IN A HURRY. IT WAS not until late the next afternoon that the wagon-train finally reached Bridgeport, and the weak, wornout mules had at last a respite from straining through the mud, under the incessant nagging of the teamsters\u0027 whips and their volleyed blasphemy. The Deacon\u0027s merciful heart had been moved by the sufferings of the poor beasts. He had done all that he could on the journey to lighten the labor of those attached to his own wagon. He had restrained as much as possible the St. Vitus Dance of the teamster\u0027s keen whip, uselessly remonstrated with him against his profanity, carried a rail to help pry the wheels out of the mudholes, and got behind and pushed going up the steep hills. At the journey\u0027s end when the exhausted brutes stood motionless, with their ears drooping and their eyes looking unutterable disgust at everything connected with the army and war, the Deacon helped the teamster take their harness off, and carry them as much corn and hay as the Forage-Master could be pursuaded to dole out to them. The Deacon\u0027s next solicitude was to get the boys aboard a train that would start out soon. This was a sore perplexity. All was rush and bustle about the railroad yard. Trains were coming, being switched hither and yon, unloaded, and reloaded, and going, in a way that was simply bewildering to the plain farmer. Men in uniform and men in plain clothes were giving orders, and these were obeyed, and everybody seemed too busy to answer questions or give information. \"Naw; git out. Don\u0027t bother me with no questions, I tell you,\" impatiently said a man in citizen\u0027s clothes, who with arms outspread was signalling the switching engines. \"\u0027Tain\u0027t my business to give information to people. Got all I kin do to furnish brains for them bull-headed engineers. Go to that Quartermaster you see over there in uniform. The Government pays him for knowin\u0027 things. It don\u0027t me.\" \"I don\u0027t know anything about the different cars, my friend,\" said the Quartermaster haughtily. \"That\u0027s the business of the railroad people. I simply order them to make up the trains for me, and they do the rest. There\u0027s a Yard-Master over there. Go ask him.\" \"Blazes and brimstone,\" exploded the Yard-Master; \"how in the devil\u0027s name do you suppose I can tell anything about the trains going out? I\u0027m just pestered to death by such fool questions, while the life\u0027s being worried out of me by these snoozers with sardine-labels on their shoulders, who strut around and give orders, and don\u0027t know enough about railroading to tell a baggage-check from a danger-signal. If they\u0027d only let me alone I\u0027d have all these trains running in and out like shuttles in a loom. But as soon\u0027s I get one arranged down comes a shoulderstrap and orders something different. Go off and ask somebody that wears brass buttons and a basswood head. Don\u0027t bother me. Get out of the way of that engine there.\" In despair, the Deacon turned to a man who wore a Major\u0027s shoulder-straps. \"No,\" he answered; \"I\u0027m sorry to say that I cannot give you any information. I\u0027m only in command of the guards here. I haven\u0027t anything to do with the trains. The Quartermasters run them, and they run them as they run everything they have anything to do with—like the old man and woman run their fulling mill on the Kankakee—that is, like— \"Dumb this mixin\u0027 o\u0027 military and civilian,\" said the irritated Deacon, \"It\u0027s worse\u0027n mixin\u0027 religion and politics, and preachin\u0027 and tavern-keepin\u0027. Down there in camp everything was straight and systematic. Every feller what don\u0027t have nothin\u0027 in his shoulder-straps bosses all the fellers what hain\u0027t no shoulder-straps at all. The feller what has one bar in his shoulder-straps bosses all the fellers what hain\u0027t nothin in theirs, and the feller what has two bars bosses the fellers with but one; the feller with leaves gives orders to the fellers with bars; the feller with an eagle lays clear over him, and the man with a star jest makes everybody jump when he talks. Out at the depot on Bean Blossom Crick Sol Pringle has the say about everything. He knows when the trains come and when they go, and what goes into \u0027em. This seems to be a betwixt and between place, neither pork nor bacon, I don\u0027t like it at all, I always want things straight—either one thing or t\u0027other—reg\u0027ler close communion, total-immersion Babtist, or free-for-all, shoutin\u0027 Methodist.\" \"I think I can help you, \u0027Squire,\" said a big, goodnatured-looking civilian railroad man, who had become interested in the Deacon\u0027s troubles. \"I\u0027ve bin around with the Assistant Yard-Boss pickin\u0027 out a lot o\u0027 empties to hustle back to Nashville for grub. That\u0027s one o\u0027 them over there, on the furthest switch—X634. See? It\u0027s got a chalk mark on it. I\u0027ll help you carry your boys into it, and fix \u0027em comfortable, and you\u0027ll go back with it all right.\" The Deacon turned gladly to him. The man summoned some of his friends, who speedily transferred Si and Shorty, with their belongings, cedar boughs and all, to the car, and made them as comfortable as possible, and added some little offerings of their own to contribute to the ease of the journey. They bestired themselves to find something to eat that the boys would relish, and brought out from somewhere a can of peaches and one of tomatoes, which proved very acceptable. The Deacon was overwhelmed with gratitude. \"I want every one of you to come up to my house, whenever you git a chance,\" he said, \"and make a long visit. You shall have the very best that there is on my farm, and if you don\u0027t live well it won\u0027t be Maria Klegg\u0027s fault. She\u0027ll jest lay herself out to be good to men who\u0027s bin good to her son, and when she lays herself out to git up a dinner the Burnett House in Cincinnati takes a back seat.\" Feeling entirely at ease, he climbed into the car, with a copy of the Cincinnati Gazette, which he had bought of a newsboy, lighted his pipe, put on his spectacles, and settled down to a labored, but thorough perusal of the paper, beginning at the head-lines on the upper left-hand corner, and taking in every word, advertisements and all, as systematically as he would weed a garden-bed or milk a cow. The Deacon never did anything slip-shod, especially when he had to pay 10 cents for a copy of the Cincinnati Gazette. He was going to get his full money\u0027s worth, and if it was not in the news and editorials, he would take it out of the advertisements and patent medicine testimonials. He was just going through a convincing testimonial to the manifold virtues of Spalding\u0027s Prepared Glue, when there was a bump, the sound of coupling, and his car began to move off. \"Glory, we\u0027re goin\u0027 home!\" shouted the Deacon, waving his paper exultingly to the railroad men who had been so helpful. But he exulted prematurely. The engine rattled ahead sharply for a few hundred yards, and then began backing to opposite the spot where it had started from. \"That\u0027s all right,\" said his railroads friends encouragingly. \"She\u0027s just run back on the other switch to take up a couple more cars. She\u0027ll go ahead all right presently.\" \"I hope it is all right,\" said the Deacon, a little abashed; \"but I never had any use for a hoss that went back more\u0027n he did forrard.\" But this was only the first of many similar experiences, which occupied the rest of the day. \"Good gracious, do they want to wear the track and wheels and injines clean out?\" grumbled the Deacon. \"No wonder they\u0027re all out o\u0027 order. If I jammed my wagon back and forrard this way it wouldn\u0027t last a month. No wonder war-taxes are high, with everybody doin\u0027 all they kin to waste and destroy property. I\u0027ve a great mind to write to Gen. Rosecrans or President Lincoln callin\u0027 attention to the way their hired men monkey around, and waste time, and don\u0027t accomplish nothin\u0027.\" Some time after dark, and after the Deacon\u0027s patience had become well-nigh exhausted, the railroad men came around with a lantern, and told him that at last it was settled, and the train would move out very soon. There had been conflicting orders during the day, but now the Chief Quartermaster at Nashville had ordered the train forward. Sure enough, the train pulled out presently, and went rattling up toward Shelbyville. Again the Deacon\u0027s heart bounded high, and after watching the phantom-like roadside for awhile, he grew very sleepy, and crawled in alongside of Si. He waked up at daylight, and went at once to the car-door hopefully expecting to recognize the outskirts of Nashville, or at least Murfreesboro. To his dismay, he saw the same sutler\u0027s shanty, mule-corral, pile of baled-hay, and the embalmer\u0027s sign on a tree which had been opposite them while standing on the track at Bridgeport. Shorty swore volubly, and for once the Deacon did not check him, but was sinfully conscious in his heart of approving the profanity. \"Swearin\u0027s awful wicked and low,\" he said to himself. \"A sensible man can get along without it ordinarily, by the grace o\u0027 God and hard tryin\u0027, though I\u0027ve knowed a yoke o\u0027 dumbed steers in a stumpy field to purty nigh overcome me. But the army\u0027s no common experience, and I s\u0027pose a man\u0027s justified in bustin\u0027 out in a time like this. Old Job was lucky that he didn\u0027t have to ride on an army railroad.\" In Despair, the Deacon Turned to a Major. 77 His railroad friend again came up with some hot coffee and broiled meat, and explained that after the train had reached a station some miles out it got orders to run back and clear the track for some trains of troops from the Army of the Potomac which were being rushed through. The Deacon\u0027s heart almost sank in despair, but he took the coffee and meat, and helped the boys to it. As they were all eating they heard a voice outside which struck on the chords of their memories: \"Where is that Yard-Boss? Where is that Yard-Boss? Find him and send him to me, immediately.\" \"That sounds like Levi Rosenbaum,\" said Shorty. Si nodded affirmatively. The Deacon looked out,\u0027 and recognized Levi dressed in the hight of fashion. On his jetty curls sat a glossy silk hat, his clothes looked as if just taken from the tailor\u0027s shop, and they fitted him to perfection. A large diamond flashed from his scarfpin, and another gleamed in a ring on his right hand as he waved it in giving orders to the men around. Every eye was fixed on him, and when he spoke there was hastening to obey. The Yard-Boss was coming at a run. \"Why are those cotton-cars still standing there this morning, after the orders I gave you yesterday?\" asked Levi, in tones of severest reprehension, as that official came up. \"Why, Mr. Rosenbaum,\" said that official apologetically—he was the same man who had so severely snubbed the Deacon the day before—\"you see I had the train made up and all ready to start, when there came orders—\" \"Whose orders?\" demanded Levi. \"Who dares give orders that over-ride mine? You go at once and have an engine—the best one you have—hitched on. Couple on my car, and be ready to start in 15 minutes. Fifteen minutes I give you,\" continued he, looking at his watch. \"Tell the Train Dispatcher to clear everything into switches until we get to Murfreesboro, and have the operator at Murfreesboro lay by everything till we get to Nashville.\" The Yard-Boss rushed off to execute the order. \"Great Jehosephat, what\u0027s come over Levi?\" muttered Shorty. \"Has he become the High-muk-a-muk of the whole army? Have they put him in Gen. Rosecrans\u0027s place?\" \"Will I dare to speak to such a high-flyer?\" said the Deacon, doubtfully. Levi\u0027s eyes, flashed from one point to another, rested on the Deacon for a moment, and the latter wreathed his face with a grin of recognition. Then Levi\u0027s stern countenance relaxed with a still broader grin. \"Hello, \u0027Squire,\" he shouted joyously. \"Is that you? Where are the boys?\" And he rushed forward with outstretched hand. \"I\u0027ve got \u0027em in here, badly hurt,\" answered the Deacon, jumping to the ground and grasping the outstretched hand in his own horny palm. \"I\u0027m very glad to see you, Mr. Rosenbaum.\" \"Glad ain\u0027t no name for it,\" said Levi. \"Did you say you\u0027d got the boys in there? Here, you men, bring me two or three of those cracker-boxes.\" By the aid of the cracker-boxes Levi climbed into the car, and shook the boys\u0027 hands, and cried and talked mingled gladness and sympathy in his broken English. \"What place have you got, and what are you doin\u0027 down here, Mr. Rosenbaum,\" the Deacon asked in the first lull. \"O, I\u0027m Special Agent of the Treasury in charge of the cotton business. You see, these rascals have been stealing the Treasury blind, in cotton, and they had to have an honest man down here, who was up to all their tricks, and wouldn\u0027t stand no nonsense. They sent me, and gave me orders which make me boss of the whole outfit. None of them outrank me about these trains.\" \"So I see,\" said the Deacon. \"Wisht I\u0027d had a handful of your authority yesterday.\" \"Here, we\u0027re wasting time,\" said Levi suddenly. \"You\u0027re tryin\u0027 to get these boys back home. I\u0027ll see that they get as far as the Ohio River as fast as the train\u0027ll go. Here, six or eight of you men pick up these boys and carry them over to my car there. Handle them as if they were eggs, for they\u0027re my friends.\" There was no lack of willing hands to execute this order. That was long before the days of private cars, even for railway magnates, but Rosenbaum had impressed a caboose for himself, which he had had fitted up with as many of the comforts of a home as were available at that era of car-building. He had a good bed with a spring mattress for himself and another for his friends, table, chairs, washroom and a fairly-equipped kitchen, stored with provisions, for he was as fond of good living as of sumptuous raiment. All this and more he was only too glad to place at the disposal of the Deacon and the boys. The Deacon himself was not more solicitous about their comfort. The train started as Levi had ordered, and sped along on a clear track to Nashville. Cotton was needed at the North almost as much as rations were needed at the front, and a train loaded with Treasury cotton had superior rights to the track which must not be disregarded. At Nashville a friend of Levi\u0027s, a Surgeon of generally recognized skill, and whom Levi had telegraphed for, came aboard with a couple of skilled nurses, who bathed the boys, dressed their wounds, and replaced their soiled, torn clothes with new, clean ones, including fine, soft underwear from Levi\u0027s own wardrobe. \"Say, Doc,\" said Shorty, after this was finished and he had devoured a supper cooked under Levi\u0027s special care, \"I feel so much better that I don\u0027t believe there\u0027s any need o\u0027 my goin on any further. I\u0027ll jest lay by here, and go into Convalescent Camp for a few days, and then go back to the front with a squad, and help clean up our cracker line. I\u0027d like awfully well to have a hand in runnin\u0027 them rebels offen Lookout Mountain. They\u0027ve bin too infernally impudent and sassy for any earthly use.\" \"Indeed you won\u0027t,\" said the Surgeon decisively. \"You\u0027ll go straight home, and stay there until you are well. You won\u0027t be fit for duty for at least a month yet, if then. If you went out into camp now you would have a relapse, and be dead inside of a week. The country between here and Chattanooga is dotted with the graves of men who have been sent back to the front too soon.\" The journey to Louisville was delightful. At Louisville Levi tried hard to get his caboose taken across the river and attached to a train on the other side, so that the boys could go clear home in it. But a Special Treasury Agent had but little of the importance north of the Ohio River that he had south of it. Still, Levi managed to get the crew of an accommodation train interested in the boys, whom he had driven across the river on a light wagon, lying on his spring mattress. They were placed in a comfortable caboose, and soon were speeding on the last stretch of the journey. The day was bright and sunny, and the boys were propped up, so that they could look out of the windows and enjoy the scenery. That they were nearing home made Si nervous and fidgety. It seemed to him that the train only crawled, and stopped interminably at every station and crossing. The Deacon became alarmed lest this should unfavorably affect him, and resorted to various devices to divert his mind. He bought a Cincinnati Gazette, and began reading it aloud. Si was deeply interested in all the war news, particularly that relating to the situation at Chattanooga, but he would not listen to the merits of Spalding\u0027s Prepared Glue. The day wore away towards evening. \"Ain\u0027t we most there, Pap?\" Si asked querulously. \"About 25 mile away, I think,\" answered his father. \"I disremember just how fur that last stop is from the Crick, but I think it\u0027s betwixt 25 and 30 mile.\" Just then the whistle blew for a stop. \"What\u0027n the world are they stoppin\u0027 here for?\" groaned Si. \"Some woman\u0027s got a dozen aigs or a pound o\u0027 butter that she wants to send to town. I s\u0027pose we\u0027ll stop here until she finishes churnin\u0027, or gits another aig to make up a dozen. I never did see sich putterin\u0027 along.\" The Deacon was deeply absorbed in an editorial on \"President Lincoln\u0027s duty in this Crisis,\" and paid no attention. Shorty craned his long neck out of the window. \"Some gal\u0027s stopped the train to git on,\" he reported to Si. \"She\u0027s apparently been payin\u0027 a visit to a house up there a little ways, and they\u0027ve brung her down in a buggy with her trunk. She\u0027s dressed up fit to kill, and she\u0027s purtier than a peach-blossom. Jehosephat, Si, I believe she\u0027s the very same gal that you was castin\u0027 sheep\u0027s eyes at when you was home. Yes, it is.\" \"Annabel?\" gasped Si. \"What\u0027s that?\" said the Deacon, rousing to interest, but carefully putting his thumb down to mark the place where he left off. \"Shorty thinks Annabel is out there gittin\u0027 on the train.\" \"Eh,\" said the Deacon, shoving up his spectacles and taking a good look. \"It certainly is. She\u0027s been down here to see the Robinses, who live out here somewhere. I\u0027ll jest go out and bring her in here.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63279.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
