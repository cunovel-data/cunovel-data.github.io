{"id":45113,"no":78,"title":"CHAPTER XII. SI AND SHORTY IN LUCK","content":"THEY MAKE A BRIEF VISIT TO \"GOD\u0027S COUNTRY.\" THE shot fired by Nate Hartburn was the only one that interrupted the progress of the 200th Ind. to the banks of the Tennessee River. Its cautious advance at last brought it out on the crest of a hill, at the foot of which, 200 feet below, flowed the clear current of the mountain-fed stream. The rebels were all on the other side. Their pickets could be plainly seen, and they held the further pier of the burned railroad bridge. To our right rose three strong forts, built the year previous. As soon as it was determined that all the enemy were beyond the river, the 200th Ind. went into camp for the afternoon and night upon a cleared spot which had been used for that purpose before our troops had been flanked out of that country by Bragg\u0027s raid into Kentucky just a year before. A dress parade was ordered at 6 o\u0027clock, and when the Adjutant came to \"publish the orders,\" the regiment was astonished and Si electrified to hear: \"In pursuance of orders from Division Headquarters to detail squads from each of the different regiments to proceed to their respective States to bring back recruits and drafted men for the regiments, First Lieut. Bowersox, of Co. A, and Corp\u0027l Josiah Klegg, of Co. Q, with six enlisted men of that company, to be selected by Capt. McGillicuddy, are here by detailed for that duty, and will prepare to leave to-morrow morning.\" Si clutched his partner in his excitement and said, \"Shorty, did you hear that? I\u0027m to be sent back to Injianny. Ain\u0027t that what he said?\" \"If my ears didn\u0027t mistake their eyesight, them was about his words,\" returned Shorty. \"You\u0027re in luck.\" \"And you\u0027re goin\u0027 with me, Shorty.\" \"The Adjutant didn\u0027t include that in his observations. I ain\u0027t so crazy, anyway, to git back to Injianny. Now, if it wuz Wisconsin it\u0027d be different. If you\u0027ve got any recruits to bring on from Wisconsin, I\u0027m your man. I\u0027d go up there at my own expense, though I don\u0027t s\u0027pose that Rosecrans could spare me just now. What\u0027d become o\u0027 the army if he\u0027d git sick, and me away?\" \"But, Shorty, you are goin\u0027. You must go. I won\u0027t go if you don\u0027t.\" \"Don\u0027t say won\u0027t too loud. You\u0027re detailed, and men that\u0027s detailed don\u0027t have much choice in the matter. \"You\u0027ll probably act sensibly and do whatever you\u0027re ordered to do. Of course, I\u0027d like to go, if we kin git back in time for this sociable with Mister Bragg. Don\u0027t want to miss that. That\u0027ll be the he-fight o\u0027 the war, and probably the last battle.\" \"Nor do I,\" answered Si; \"but the thing won\u0027t come off till we git back. They wouldn\u0027t be sending back for the drafted men and recruits except that they want \u0027em to help out.\" \"They\u0027ll be a durned sight more in the way than help,\" answered Shorty. \"We don\u0027t need \u0027em. We\u0027ve handled Bragg so far very neatly, all by ourselves, and we don\u0027t need anybody to mix into our little job. The fewer we have the more credit there\u0027ll be in lickin\u0027 old Bragg and capturin\u0027 Chattanoogy.\" The Orderly-Sergeant interrupted the discussion by announcing: \"Here, Shorty, you\u0027re one to go with Si. The detail is made by the Colonel\u0027s orders as a compliment to the good work you boys have been doing, and which the Colonel knows about.\" \"I always said that the Colonel had the finest judgment as to soldiers of any man in the army,\" said Shorty, after taking a minute\u0027s pause to recover from the compliment. The boys were immediately surrounded by their comrades, congratulating them, and requesting that they would take back letters and money for them. The Paymaster had recently visited the regiment, and everybody had money which he wished to send home. There were also commissions to purchase in numerable things, ranging from meerschaum pipes to fine flannel shirts. \"Look here, boys,\" said Shorty, good-humoredly, \"we want to be obligin\u0027, but we\u0027re neither a Adams Express Company nor in the gent\u0027s furnishin\u0027 line. We\u0027ve neither an iron safe to carry money nor a pedler\u0027s wagon to deliver goods. John Morgan\u0027s guerrillas may jump us on the way home, and comin\u0027 back we\u0027ll have to have packs to carry the truck in, and half of it \u0027ll be stole before we git to the regiment.\" But the comrades would not be dissuaded, and be fore Si and Shorty went to sleep they had between $5,000 and $6,000 of their comrades\u0027 money stowed in various safe places about their personages. \"Great Jehosephat, Si,\" murmured Shorty, when they sat together in their tent, after the last comrade had departed, leaving his \"wad of greenbacks,\" with directions as to its disposition, \"I never felt so queer and skeery in all my life. I wouldn\u0027t for the world lose a dollar of the money these boys have been earnin\u0027 as they have this. But how under heaven are we goin\u0027 to make sure of it?\" \"I\u0027ve thought of a way o\u0027 makin\u0027 sure of to-night,\" said Si. \"I spoke to the Officer of the Guard, and he\u0027ll put a sentinel over us to-night, so\u0027s we kin git a little sleep. I wouldn\u0027t shet my eyes, if it wasn\u0027t for that. We\u0027ll have to let to-morrow take care of itself.\" Shorty lay down and tried to go to sleep, but the responsibility weighed too heavily on his mind. Presently, Si, who, for the same reason, only slept lightly, was awakened by his partner getting up. \"What are you up to?\" Si asked. \"I\u0027ve bin thinkin about pickpockets,\" answered Shorty. \"They\u0027re an awful slick lot, and I\u0027ve thought of a hiding place that\u0027ll fool \u0027em.\" He picked up his faithful Springfield, and drawing an envelope with money out of his shirt-pocket, rolled it up to fit the muzzle of his gun, and then rammed it down. \"That\u0027s Jim Meddler\u0027s $10,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll know it, because his mother\u0027s name\u0027s on the envelope. Here goes Pete Irvin\u0027s $20. I know it because it has his wife\u0027s name on it.\" He continued until he had the barrel of the gun filled, and then stopped to admire his cunning. \"Now, nobody but me\u0027d ever thought o\u0027 hidin\u0027 money in a gun. That\u0027s safe, as least. All I\u0027ve got to do is to stick to my gun until we git acrost the Ohio River. But I hain\u0027t got the tenth part in; where kin I put the rest? O, there\u0027s my cartridge-box and cap-box. Nobody\u0027ll think o\u0027 lookin\u0027 there for money.\" He filled both those receptacles, but still had fully half his money left on his person. \"That\u0027ll just have to take its chances with the pickpockets,\" said he, and returned to his bed, with his gun by his side, and his cap- and cartridge-boxes under his head. The morning came, with their money all right, as they assured themselves by careful examination immediately after reveille. As they fell in under Lieut. Bowersox to start, their comrades crowded around to say good-by, give additional messages for the home-folks, and directions as to their money, and what they wanted bought. But Shorty showed that he was overpowered with a nervous dread of pickpockets. He saw a possible light-fingered thief in everyone that approached. He would let nobody touch him, stood off a little distance from the rest of the squad, and when any body wanted to shake hands would hold him stiffly at arm\u0027s length. \"Gittin\u0027 mighty stuck-up just because the Colonel patted you on the back a little, and give you a soft detail,\" sneered one of Co. Q. \"Well, you\u0027d be stuck-up, too,\" answered Shorty, \"if your clothes was padded and stuffed with other folks\u0027 greenbacks, and you was in the midst o\u0027 sich a talented lot o\u0027 snatchers as the 200th Injianny. Mind, I ain\u0027t makin\u0027 no allusions nor references, and I think the 200th Injianny is the honestest lot o\u0027 boys in the Army o\u0027 the Cumberland; but if I wanted to steal the devil\u0027s pitchfork right out o\u0027 his hand, I\u0027d make a detail from the 200th Injianny to do the job, and I\u0027d be sure o\u0027 gittin\u0027 the pitchfork. I\u0027ll trust you all when you\u0027re 10 feet away from me.\" The others grinned and gave him a cheer. When they went to get on board the train Shorty had to change his tactics. He got Si on his right, the Lieutenant immediately in front of them, and two trusted boys of the squad directly behind, with strict injunctions to press up close, allow nobody between, and keep a hawk\u0027s eye on everybody. But both Si and Shorty were breathless with apprehension till they got through the crowd and were seated in the car, and a hasty feeling of various lumps about their persons assured them that their charges were safe. They were in a passenger car, for luck. The Lieutenant sat in front, Si and Shorty next, and the two trusty boys immediately behind. They breathed a sigh of relief. As they stood their guns over against the side of the car, Si suddenly asked: \"Shorty, did you draw your charge before you rammed that money in?\" Shorty jumped to his feet in a shudder of alarm, and exclaimed: \"Great Jehosephat, no. I forgot all about it.\" \"What\u0027s that you\u0027re saying about guns?\" inquired the Lieutenant, turning around. \"You want to load them, and keep them handy. We\u0027re liable to strike some guerrillas along the way, and we must be ready for them.\" \"You fellers\u0027ll have to do the shootin\u0027,\" whispered Shorty to Si. \"It\u0027ll be a cold day when I bang $150 in greenbacks at any rebel that ever jumped. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to take the cap off en my gun. The jostlin\u0027 o\u0027 the train\u0027s likely to knock it off at any time, and send a small fortune through the roof o\u0027 the car. I\u0027d take the money out, but I\u0027m afraid o\u0027 tearin\u0027 it all to pieces, with the train plungin\u0027 so.\" He carefully half-cocked his piece, took off the cap, rubbed the nipple to remove any stray fragments of fulminate, and then let the hammer down on a piece of wadding taken from his cap. The long ride to Nashville over the ground on which they had been campaigning and fighting for nearly a year would have been of deepest interest to Si and Shorty, as it was to the rest, if they could have freed their minds of responsibilities long enough to watch the scenery. But they would give only a cursory glance any say: \"We\u0027ll look at it as we come back.\" In the crowded depot at Nashville they had an other panic, but the Provost-Guard kept a gangway clear as soon as it was discovered that they were on duty. \"You can stack your arms there, boys,\" said the Sergeant of the Guard, \"and go right over there and get a warm supper, with plenty of coffee.\" All but Shorty obeyed with alacrity, and stacked their guns with the quickness of old and hungry vet erans. Shorty kept hold of his gun and started with the rest to the supper-room. \"Here, Injianny,\" called out the Sergeant, \"stack your gun here with the rest.\" \"Don\u0027t want to ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to,\" answered Shorty. \"What\u0027s the reason you ain\u0027t?\" asked the Sergeant, catching hold of the gun. \"Nobody\u0027s going to take it, and if they did, you can pick up another. Plenty of \u0027em, jest as good as that, all around here.\" \"Don\u0027t care. This is my own gun. I think more of it than any gun ever made, and I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to take any chance of losin\u0027 it.\" \"Well, then, you\u0027ll take a chance of losing your supper,\" answered the Sergeant, \"or rather you\u0027ll be certain of it, for the orders are strict against taking guns into the supper-room. Too many accidents have happened.\" \"Well, then,\" said Shorty stoutly, \"I\u0027ll do without my supper, though I\u0027m hungrier than a wolf at the end of a long Winter.\" \"Well, if you\u0027re so infernal pig-headed, you\u0027ve got to,\" answered the Sergeant, nettled at Shorty\u0027s obstinacy. \"Go back beyond the gunstack, and stay there. Don\u0027t you come nearer the door than the other side of the stack.\" Shorty\u0027s dander rose up at once. At any other time he would have conclusions with the Sergeant then and there. But the remembrance of his charge laid a repressive hand upon his quick choler, and reminded him that any kind of a row would probably mean a night in the guard-house, his gun in some other man\u0027s hands, probably lost forever, and so on. He decided to defer thrashing the Sergeant until his return, when he would give it to him with interest. He shouldered his gun, paced up and down, watching with watering mouth the rest luxuriating in a hot supper with fragrant coffee and appetizing viands, to which his mouth had been a stranger for many long months. It cost a severe struggle, but he triumphed. Si, in his own hungry eagerness, had not missed him, until his own appetite began to be appeased by the vigorous onslaught he made on the eatables. Then he looked around for his partner, and was horrified not to find him by his side. \"Where\u0027s Shorty,\" he anxiously inquired. Each looked at the other in surprise, and asked: \"Why, ain\u0027t he here?\" \"No, confound it; he ain\u0027t here,\" said Si, excitedly springing to his feet; \"he has been knocked down and robbed.\" Si bolted out, followed by the rest. They saw Shorty marching up and down as a sentinel sternly military, and holding his Springfield as rigidly correct as if in front of the Colonel\u0027s quarters. \"What\u0027s the matter with you, Shorty? Why don\u0027t you come in to supper?\" called out Si. \"It\u0027s a mighty good square meal. Come on in.\" \"Can\u0027t do it. Don\u0027t want no supper. Ain\u0027t hungry. Got business out here,\" answered Shorty, who had gotten one of his rare fits of considering himself a martyr. \"Nonsense,\" said Si. \"Put your gun in the stack and come in. It\u0027s a bully supper. Best we\u0027ve had for a year.\" \"Well, eat it, then,\" answered Shorty crustily. \"I\u0027ve got something more important to think of than good suppers.\" \"O, rats! It\u0027s as safe in there as out here. Set your gun down and come on in.\" \"This gun shall not leave my side till we\u0027re home,\" said Shorty in a tone that would have become the Roman sentinel at Pompeii. \"O, I forgot,\" said Si. \"Well, bring it in with you.\" \"Can\u0027t do it. Strictly agin orders to take any guns inside. But leave me alone. Go back and finish your gorge. I kin manage to hold out somehow,\" answered Shorty in a tone of deep resignation that made Si want to box his ears. \"That\u0027s too bad. But I\u0027ll tell you what we can do. I\u0027ve had a purty good feed already enough to last me to Looeyville. Let me take your gun. I\u0027ll carry it while you go in and fill up. We hain\u0027t much time left.\" The fragrance of the coffee, the smell of the fried ham smote Shorty\u0027s olfactories with almost irresistible force. He wavered just a little—. \"Si, I\u0027d trust you as I would no other man in Co. Q or the regiment. I\u0027ll—\" Then his Spartan virtue reasserted itself: \"No, Si; you\u0027re too young and skittish. You mean well, but you have spells, when—\" \"Fall in, men,\" said Lieut. Bowersox, bustling out from a good meal in the officers\u0027 room. \"Fall in promptly. We must hurry up to catch the Looeyville train.\" The car for Louisville was filled with characters as to whom there was entirely too much ground for fear—gamblers, \"skin-game\" men, thieves, and all the human vermin that hang around the rear of a great army. Neither of the boys allowed themselves a wink of sleep, but sat bolt upright the entire night, watching everyone with steady, stern eyes. They recognized all the rascals they had seen \"running games\" around the camps at Murfreesboro, and who had been time and again chased out of camp even the whisky seller with whom Si\u0027s father had the adventure. The Provost-Guard had been making one of its periodical cleaning-ups of Nashville, and driving out the obnoxious characters. Several of these had tried to renew their acquaintance by offering drinks from well-filled bottles, but they were sternly repulsed, and Shorty quietly knocked one persistent fellow down with a quick whirl of his gun-barrel. When Shorty was hungry it was dangerous to trifle with him. They arrived at Louisville late in the morning, and were hurried across the river to Jeffersonville. Fortunately they were able to find there an eating-room where guns were not barred, and Shorty made amends for the past by ravaging as far as his arms could reach, holding his precious gun firmly between his knees. \"Say, pardner,\" said the man who ran the establishment, \"I\u0027d much rather board you for a day than a week. Rebels must\u0027ve cut off the supply-trains where you\u0027ve bin. You\u0027re not comin\u0027 this way agin soon, air you? I\u0027m afraid I won\u0027t make \u0027nough this month to pay my rent.\" Lieut. Bowersox came in with a telegram in his hand. \"We won\u0027t go on to Indianapolis,\" he said. \"I\u0027m ordered to wait here for our squad, which will probably get here by to-morrow evening.\" A wild hope flashed up in Si\u0027s mind. \"Lieutenant,\" he said, \"we live right over there in Posey County. Can\u0027t you let us go home? We can make it, and be back here before to-morrow night.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said the Lieutenant doubtfully, as he mentally calculated the distance to Posey County. \"I hadn\u0027t ought to let you go. Then, you can\u0027t have more than an hour or two at home.\" \"O,\u0027 goodness; just think o\u0027 havin\u0027 one hour at home,\" ejaculated Si. \"It seems too bad,\" continued the Lieutenant, moved by Si\u0027s earnestness, \"to bring you this near, and not let you have a chance to see your folks. \"It\u0027ll be a risk for me, and there are not many men in the regiment I\u0027d take it for, but I\u0027ll let you go. \"Remember, it\u0027ll make a whole lot of trouble for me if you\u0027re not here by to-morrow evening.\" \"We\u0027ll be here by to-morrow evening, if alive,\" he pledged himself. \"Well, then, go,\" said the Lieutenant. Si\u0027s head fairly swam, and he and Shorty ran so fast to make sure of the train that there was a suspicion in the minds of some of the citizens that they were escaping from their officers. Si\u0027s heart was in a tumult as the engine-bell rang its final warning and the engine moved out with increasing speed. Every roll of the swift wheels was carrying him nearer the dearest ones on earth. The landscape seemed to smile at him as he sped past. \"Isn\u0027t this the grandest country on earth, Shorty?\" he bubbled over. \"It\u0027s God\u0027s country for a fact. So different from old run-down, rebel-ridden Tennessee. Look at the houses and the farms; look at the people and the live-stock. Look at the towns and the churches. Look at everything. Here\u0027s the country where people live. Down yonder\u0027s only where they stay and raise Cain.\" \"Yes,\" admitted Shorty, who had not so much reason for being enthusiastic; \"but the Wisconsin boys say that Wisconsin\u0027s as much finer than Injianny as Injianny\u0027s finer\u0027n Tennessee. I\u0027ll take you up there some day and show you.\" \"Don\u0027t believe a dumbed word of it,\" said Si, hot with State pride. \"God never made a finer country than Injianny. Wisconsin\u0027s nowhere.\" Then he bethought himself of the many reasons he had for gladness in his home-coming which his partner had not, and said thoughtfully: \"I wish, Shorty, you wuz goin\u0027 home, too, to your father and mother and sisters, and—and best girl. But my father and mother\u0027ll be as glad to see you as if you was their own son, and the girls\u0027ll make just as much of you, and mebbe you\u0027ll find another girl there that\u0027s purtier and better, and—\" \"Stop right there, Si Klegg,\" said Shorty. \"All girls is purty and nice that is, them that is purty and nice, but some\u0027s purtier and nicer than others. Then, agin, one\u0027s a hundred times purtier and nicer than any o\u0027 them. I\u0027ve no doubt that the girls out your way are much purtier and nicer\u0027n the general run o\u0027 girls, but none o\u0027 them kin hold a candle to that girl up in Wisconsin, and I won\u0027t have you sayin\u0027 so.\" \"If we\u0027re on time,\" said Si, by way of changing the subject, \"we\u0027ll git to the station about sundown. The farm\u0027s about three miles from the station, and we\u0027ll reach home after supper. Pap\u0027ll be settin\u0027 out on the front porch, smokin\u0027, and readin\u0027 the Cincinnati Gazette, and mother\u0027ll be settin\u0027 beside him knittin\u0027, and the girls\u0027ll be clearin\u0027 away the supper things. My, won\u0027t they be surprised to see us! Won\u0027t there be a time! And won\u0027t mother and the girls fly around to git us something to eat! Won\u0027t they shake up that old cook-stove, and grind coffee, and fry ham and eggs, and bake biscuits, and git us cool, sweet milk and delicious butter from the old spring-house, and talk all the time! Shorty, you never heard my sisters talk, especially when they\u0027re a little excited. Gracious, they\u0027ll just talk the ears off both of us.\" \"Well, if they take after you, they are talkers from Talkville,\" said Shorty. \"Mill-wheels ain\u0027t in it with your tongue, when it gits fairly started.\" The train was on time, and just as the sun was setting behind the fringe of cottonwoods along Bean Blossom Creek they stopped at the little station, and started to walk out to the farm. A neighbor who was drawing a load of tile from the station recognized Si, and begged them to get up and ride, but the team was too slow for the impatient boys, and they forged ahead. A thousand well-remembered objects along the road would have arrested Si\u0027s attention were it not for the supreme interest farther on. At last they came to a little rise of ground which commanded a view of the house, and there, as Si predicted, sat his father and mother engaged in smoking, reading and knitting. His first impulse was to yell with delight, but he restrained himself, and walked as steadily on as he could to the front gate. Old Towser set up a bark and ran down the walk, and then changed his note to de lightful yelps of recognition. Si was so nervous that he fumbled vainly for a minute at the gate-latch, and while he did so he heard his mother say: \"Father, there\u0027s a couple o\u0027 soldiers out there.\" \"Wonder if they kin be from Si\u0027s company,\" said the father, lowering his paper, and looking over his spectacles. \u0027father, There\u0027s a Couple of Soldiers out There.\u0027 159 \"Why, it\u0027s Si himself,\" screamed the mother in joyful accents. The next instant she had sped down the walk quicker than she had ever gone in her girlhood days, her arms about his neck, and she was crying on his shoulder.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63265.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
