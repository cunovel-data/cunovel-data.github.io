THE boys were sitting around having another smoke before crawling into their blankets, spread under the shade of the scraggly locusts and mangy cedars, when the dogs raised an alarm. \"Get back under the shadow of the trees, boys, and keep quiet,\" said Si. \"Hello, the house!\" came out of the darkness at the foot of the hill. \"Hello, thar\u0027 yourself,\" answered Shorty, imitating Mrs. Bolster\u0027s voice. \"Hit\u0027s me—Brad Tingle. Don\u0027t yo\u0027 know my voice? Call off yer dogs. They\u0027ll eat me up.\" \"Hullo, Brad; is that yo\u0027? Whar\u0027d yo\u0027 come from? Git out, thar, Watch! Lay down, Tige! Begone, Bones! Come on up, Brad.\" Shorty\u0027s imitations of Mrs. Bolster\u0027s voice and manner were so good as to deceive even the dogs, who changed their attitude of shrill defiance to one of fawning welcome. \"Whar\u0027d yo\u0027 come from, Brad?\" repeated Shorty as the newcomer made his way up the narrow, stony path. \"Jest from the Yankee camps,\" answered the newcomer. \"Me an\u0027 Jim Wyatt\u0027s bin over thar by that236 Hoosier camp tryin\u0027 to git the drop on their Kurnel as he was gwine t\u0027 Brigade Headquarters. We a\u0027most had him when a company o\u0027 Yankees that\u0027d bin out in the country for something a\u0027most run over us. They\u0027uns wuz a-nigh on top o\u0027 we\u0027uns afore we seed they\u0027uns, an\u0027 then we\u0027uns had t\u0027 scatter. Jim run one way an\u0027 me another. I come back here t\u0027 see ef yo\u0027 had any o\u0027 the boys here. I hearn tell that a passel o\u0027 Yankee ossifers is at a dance over at the Widder Brewster\u0027s an\u0027 I thought we\u0027uns might done gether they\u0027uns in ef we\u0027uns went about it right.\" \"So you kin—so you kin,\" said Shorty, reaching out from behind the bushes and catching him by the collar. \"And to show you how, I\u0027ll jest gether you in.\" A harsh, prolonged, sibilant, far-reaching hiss came from the door of the cabin, but came too late to warn Brad Tingle of the trap into which he was walking. Shorty understood it at once. He jerked Tingle forward into Si\u0027s strong clutch, and then walked toward the cabin, singing out angrily: \"Jeff Hackberry, I want you to make that wife o\u0027 your\u0027n mind her own bisness, and let other people\u0027s alone. You and her\u0027ve got quite enough to do to tend to your honeymoon, without mixing into things that don\u0027t concern you. Take her back to bed and keep her there.\" He went back to where Si was disarming and searching Tingle. The prisoner had a United States musket, cartridge-box, canteen, and a new haversack, all of which excited Shorty\u0027s ire.237 \"You hound, you,\" he said, taking him by the throat with a fierce grasp, \"you\u0027ve bin bushwhacking, and got these things off some soldier you sneaked onto and killed. We ought to kill you right now, like we would a dog.\" \"No, Mister, I haint killed nobody; I swar t\u0027 God I haint,\" gurgled the prisoner, trying to release his throat from Shorty\u0027s grip. \"Where\u0027d you git these things?\" demanded Shorty. \"Mrs. Bolster gi\u0027 me the gun an\u0027 cartridge-box; I done found the canteen in the road, an\u0027 the poke with the letters in hit the Yank had done laid down beside him when he stopped t\u0027 git a drink, an\u0027 me an\u0027 Jim crep\u0027 up on him an\u0027 ordered him to surrender. He jumped an\u0027 run, an\u0027 we wuz af eared to shoot least we bring the rest o\u0027 the Yanks down onto us.\" At the mention of letters Si began eagerly examining the contents of the haversack. He held some of them down to the light of the fire, and then exclaimed excitedly: \"Why, boys, this is our mail. It was Will Gobright they were after.\" A sudden change came over Shorty. He took the prisoner by the back of the neck and ran him up to the door of the house and flung him inside. Then he hastened back to the fire and said: \"Le\u0027s see them letters.\" A pine-knot had been thrown on the fire to make a bright blaze, by the light of which Si was laboriously fumbling over the letters. Even by the flaring, uncertain glare it could be seen that a ruddy hue came into his face as he came across one with a gorgeous flag on one end of the envelope, and directed in a238 pinched, labored hand on straight lines scratched by a pin. He tried to slip the letter unseen by the rest into his blouse pocket, but fumbled it so badly that he dropped the rest in a heap at the edge of the fire. \"Look out, Si,\" said Shorty crossly, and hastily snatching the letters away from the fire. \"You\u0027ll burn up somebody\u0027s letters, and then there\u0027ll be no end o\u0027 trouble. You\u0027re clumsier\u0027n a foundered horse. Your fingers are all thumbs.\" \"Handle them yourself, if you think you kin do any better,\" said Si, who, having got all that he wanted, lost interest in the rest. If Si\u0027s fingers were all thumbs. Shorty\u0027s seemed all fists. Besides, his reading of handwriting was about as laborious as climbing a ladder. He tackled the lot bravely, though, and laboriously spelled out and guessed one address after another, until suddenly his eye was glued on a postmark that differed from the others. \"Wis.\" first caught his glance, and he turned the envelope around until he had spelled out \"Bad Ax\" as the rest of the imprint. This was enough. Nobody else in the regiment got letters from Bad Ax, Wis. He fumbled the letter into his blouse pocket, and in turn dropped the rest at the edge of the fire, arousing protests from the other boys. \"Well, if any o\u0027 you think you kin do better\u0027n I kin, take \u0027em up. There they are,\" said he. \"You go over \u0027em, Tom Welch. I must look around a little.\" Shorty secretly caressed the precious envelope in his pocket with his great, strong fingers, and pondered as to how he was going to get an opportunity to read the letter before daylight. It was too sacred239 and too sweet to be opened and read before the eyes of his unsympathetic, teasing comrades, and yet it seemed an eternity to wait till morning. He stole a glance out of the corner of his eye at Si, who was going through the same process, as he stood with abstracted air on the other side of the fire. The sudden clamor of the dogs recalled them to present duties. \"Hullo, the house!\" came out of the darkness. \"Hullo, yourself!\" replied Shorty, in Mrs. Bolster\u0027s tones. \"It\u0027s me—Groundhog. Call off yer dogs.\" Si and Shorty looked startled, and exchanged significant glances. \"Needn\u0027t \u0027ve told it was him,\" said Shorty. \"I could smell his breath even this far. Hullo, Groundhog,\" he continued in loud tones. \"Come on up. Git out, Watch! Lay down, Tige! Begone, Bones! Come on up, Groundhog. What\u0027s the news?\" A louder, longer, more penetrating hiss than ever sounded from the house. Shorty looked around angrily. Si made a break for the door. \"No, I can\u0027t come up now,\" said Groundhog; \"I jest come by to see if things wuz all right. A company went out o\u0027 camp this mornin\u0027 for some place that I couldn\u0027t find out. I couldn\u0027t git word t\u0027 you, an\u0027 I\u0027ve bin anxious \u0027bout whether it come this way.\" \"Never tetched us,\" answered Shorty, in perfect reproduction of Mrs. Bolster\u0027s accents. \"We\u0027uns is all right.\" The hissing from the cabin became so loud that it seemed impossible for Groundhog not to hear it.240 \"Blast it, Si, can\u0027t you gag that old guinea-hen,\" said Shorty, in a savage undertone. Si was in the meanwhile muttering all sorts of savage threats at Mrs. Bolster, the least of which was to go in and choke the life out of her if she did not stop her signalling. \"Glad t\u0027 hear it,\" said Groundhog. \"I was a leetle skeery all day about it, an\u0027 come out as soon\u0027s I could. Have yo\u0027 seed Brad Tingle?\" \"Yes; seen him to-day.\" \"D\u0027 yo\u0027 know whar he is? Kin yo\u0027 git word to him quick?\" \"Yes, indeed; right off.\" \"Well, send word to him as soon as you kin, that I\u0027ve got the mules ready for stampedin\u0027 an\u0027 runnin\u0027 off at any time, an\u0027 waitin\u0027 for him. The sooner he kin jump the corral the better. To-night, if he kin, but suttinly not later\u0027n to-morrer night. Be sure and git word to him by early to-morrer mornin\u0027 at the furthest.\" \"I\u0027ll be sure t\u0027 git word t\u0027 him this very night,\" answered the fictitious Mrs. Bolster. \"Well, good-night. I must hurry along, an\u0027 git back afore the second relief goes off. All my friends air on it. See yo\u0027 ter-morrer, if I kin.\" \"You jest bet you\u0027ll see me to-morrow,\" said Shorty grimly, as he heard Groundhog\u0027s mule clatter away. \"If you don\u0027t see me the disappointment \u0027ll come nigh breaking my heart. Now I\u0027ll go in and learn Mr. and Mrs. Hackberry how to spend the first night o\u0027 their wedded lives.\" \"I don\u0027t keer ef yo\u0027 do shoot me. I\u0027d a heap ruther be shot than not,\" she was saying to Si as Shorty241 came up. \"I\u0027ve changed my mind sence I\u0027ve bin put in here. I\u0027d a heap ruther die than live with Jeff Hackberry.\" \"Never knowed married folks to git tired o\u0027 one another so soon,\" commented Shorty. \"But I should\u0027ve thought that Jeff\u0027 d got tired first. But this it no time to fool around with fambly jars. Look here, Jeff Hackberry, you must make that wife o\u0027 yourn keep quiet. If she tries to give another signal we\u0027ll tie you up by the thumbs now, besides shoot you in the mornin\u0027.\" \"What kin I do with her?\" whined Jeff. \"Do with her? You kin make her mind. That\u0027s your duty. You\u0027re the head o\u0027 the fambly.\" \"Head o\u0027 the fambly?\" groaned Jeff, in mournful sarcasm. \"Mister, you don\u0027t seem to be acquainted with \u0027Frony. \"Head o\u0027 the fambly,\" sneered his wife. \"He aint the head o\u0027 nothin\u0027. Not the head o\u0027 a pin. He haint no more head\u0027n a fishworm.\" \"Look here, woman,\" said Shorty, \"didn\u0027t you promise to love, honor and obey him?\" \"No, I didn\u0027t nuther. I said I\u0027d shove, hammer an\u0027 belay him. Hit\u0027s none o\u0027 yer bizniss, nohow, yo\u0027 sneakin\u0027 Yankee\u0027 what I do to him. You hain\u0027t no call t\u0027 mix betwixt him an\u0027 me. An\u0027 my mouth\u0027s my own. I\u0027ll use hit jest as I please, in spite o\u0027 yo\u0027 an\u0027 him, an\u0027 40 others like yo\u0027. Hear that?\" \"Well, you git back into that bed, an\u0027 stay there, and don\u0027t you dare give another signal, or I\u0027ll buck-and-gag you on your wedding-night.\" \"Don\u0027t you dar tetch me,\" she said menacingly. \"I aint goin\u0027 to tech you. I\u0027m too careful what I242 touch. But I\u0027ll tie you to that bed and gag you, if you don\u0027t do as I say. Get back into bed at once.\" \"I ain\u0027t gwine t\u0027, and yo\u0027 can\u0027t make me,\" she said defiantly. \"Take hold of her, Jeff,\" said Shorty, pulling out his bayonet and giving that worthy a little prod. Jeff hesitated until Shorty gave him a more earnest prod, when he advanced toward his wife, but, as he attempted to lay his hands on her shoulders, she caught him, gave him a quick twist and a trip, and down he went; but he had clutched her to save himself from falling, and brought her down with him. Shorty caught her elbows and called to Si to bring him a piece of cord, with which he tied her arms. Another piece bound her ankles. She lay on the floor and railed with all the vehemence of her vicious tongue. \"Pick her up and lay her on the bed there,\" Shorty ordered Jeff. Jeff found some difficulty in lifting the tall, bony frame, but Shorty gave him a little help with the ponderous but agile feet, and the woman was finally gotten on the bed. \"Now, we\u0027ll gag you next, if you make any more trouble,\" threatened Shorty. \"We don\u0027t allow no woman to interfere with military operations.\" They had scarcely finished this when the dogs began barking again, and Si and Shorty hurried out. The operations in the house had rather heated them, the evening was warm, and Shorty had taken off his blouse and drawn it up inside of his belt, in the rear. The noise of the dogs betokened the approach of something more than usual visitors. Through the clamor the boys\u0027 quick ears could detect the clatter243 of an ominous number of hoofs. The other boys heard it, too, and were standing around, gun in hand, waiting developments. \"Hullo, dere, de house!\" came in a voice Si and Shorty dimly recognized having heard somewhere before. \"Hullo, yourself,\" answered Shorty. \"Who air yo?\"243 \"I\u0027m Capt. Littles,\" came back above the noise of barking. \"Call off your togs. I\u0027m all righdt. Is it all right up dere?\" \"Yes. Lay down. Watch! Git out, Tige!\" Shorty started to answer, when he was interrupted by the apparition of Mrs. Bolster-Hackberry flying out of the door, and yelling at the top of her voice: \"No, hit ain\u0027t all right at all. Captain. The Yankees \u0027ve got us. Thar\u0027s a right smart passel o\u0027 \u0027em here, with we\u0027uns prisoners. Jump \u0027em, if you\u0027 kin. If yo\u0027 can\u0027t, skeet out an\u0027 git enough t\u0027 down \u0027em an\u0027 git us out.\" Si and Shorty recognized that the time for words was passed. They snatched up their guns and fired in the direction of the hail. The other boys did the same. There was a patter of replying shots, aimed at the fire around which they had been standing, but had moved away from. Apparently, Capt. Littles thought the Yankees were in too great force for him to attack, for his horses could be heard moving away. The boys followed them with shots aimed at the sound. Si and Shorty ran down forward a little ways, hoping to get a better sight. The rebels halted, apparently244 dis mounted, got behind a fence and began firing back at intervals. Si and Shorty fired from the point they had gained, and drew upon themselves quite a storm of shots. \"Things look bad,\" said Si to Shorty. \"They\u0027ve halted there to hold us while they send for reinforcements. We\u0027d better go back to the boys and get things in shape. Mebbe we\u0027d better send back to camp for help.\" \"We\u0027ll wait till we find out more about \u0027em,\" said Shorty, as they moved back. They had to cross the road, upon the white surface of which they stood out in bold contrast and drew some shots which came uncomfortably close. The other boys, after a severe struggle, had caught Mrs. Bolster-Hackberry and put her back in the cabin. After a brief consultation, it was decided to hold their ground until daylight. They could get into the cabin, and by using it as a fortification, stand off a big crowd of enemies. The rest of the boys were sent inside to punch out loop-holes between the logs, and make the place as defensible as possible. Si and Shorty were to stay outside and observe. \"I\u0027ve got an idee how to fix that old woman,\" said Shorty suddenly. \"Buck-and-gag her?\" inquired Si. \"No; we\u0027ll go in there and chuck her down that hole where she kept her whisky, and fasten the hasp in the staple.\" \"Good idee, if the hole will hold her.\" \"It\u0027s got to hold her. We can\u0027t have her245 rampaging round during the fight. I\u0027d rather have a whole company o\u0027 rebels on my back.\" They did not waste any words with the old woman, but despite her yells and protests Si took hold of one shoulder Shorty the other, and forced her down in the pit and closed the puncheon above her. They went out again to reconnoiter. The enemy was quiet, apparently waiting. Only one shot, fired in the direction of the fire, showed that they were still there. Shorty suddenly bethought him of his blouse, in the pocket of which was the precious letter. He felt for it. It was gone. He was stunned. \"I remember, now,\" he said to himself, \"it was working out as I ran, and it slipped down as I climbed the fence.\" He said aloud: \"Si, I\u0027ve lost my blouse. I dropped it down there jest before we crossed the road. I\u0027m goin\u0027 to get it.\" \"Blast the blouse,\" said Si; \"let it be till mornin\u0027. You need something worse\u0027n a blouse to-night. You\u0027ll ketch a bullet sure\u0027s you\u0027re alive if you try to go acrost that road agin. They rake it.\" \"I don\u0027t care if they do,\" said Shorty desperately. \"I\u0027d go down there if a battery raked it. There\u0027s a letter in the pocket that I must have.\" Si instinctively felt for the letter in his own pocket. \"Very well,\" he said, \"if you feel as if you must go I\u0027ll go along.\" \"No, you sha\u0027n\u0027t. You stay here in command; it\u0027s your duty. You can\u0027t help if you do go. I\u0027ll go alone. I\u0027ll tell you what you might do, though. You might go over there to the left and fire on \u0027em, as if246 we wuz feelin\u0027 around that way. That\u0027ll draw some o\u0027 their attention.\" Si did as suggested. Shorty crept back to the point they had before occupied. The rebels saw him coming over a httle knoll, and fired at him. He ran for the fence. He looked over at the road, and thought he saw the blouse lying in the ditch on the opposite side. He sprang over the fence and ran across the road. The rebels had anticipated this and sent a volley into the road. One bullet struck a small stone, which flew up and smote Shorty\u0027s cheek so sharply that he reeled. But he went on across, picked up the blouse, found the dear letter, and deliberately stopped in the road until he transferred it to the breast of his shirt. Then he sprang back over the fence, and stopped there a moment to rest. He could hear the rebel Captain talking to his men, and every moment the accents of the voice became more familiar. \"Don\u0027t vaste your shods,\" he was saying. \"Don\u0027d vire undil you sees somedings to shood ad, unt den vire to hid. See how many shods you haf alretty vired mitout doing no goot. You must dink dat ammunition\u0027s as blenty as vater in de Southern Confederacy. If you hat as much druble as I haf to ket cartridges you vould pe more garcful of dem.\" Capt. Littles was Rosenbaum, the Jew spy, masquerading in a new role. Shorty\u0027s heart leaped. Instantly he thought of a way to let Rosenbaum know whom he had run up against. \"Corporal Si Klogg!\" he called out in his loudest tones. \"What is it, Shorty?\" answered the wondering Si.247 \"Don\u0027t let any more o\u0027 the boys shoot over there to the left. That\u0027s the way Capt. McGillicuddy\u0027s a-comin\u0027 in with Co. Q. I think I kin see him now jest raisin\u0027 the hill. Yes, I\u0027m sure it\u0027s him.\" The next instant he heard the rebel Captain saying to his men: \"Boys, dey\u0027re goming up in our rear. Dey\u0027re de men ve saw a liddle vhile ago. De only vay is to mount unt make a rush past de house. All mount unt vollow me as vast as dey gan.\" There was a gallop of horsemen up the road, and they passed by like the wind, while Si and Shorty fired as fast as they could load—Shorty over their heads. Si at the noise. Just opposite the house the Captain\u0027s horse stumbled, and his rider went over his head into a bank of weeds. The rest swept on, not heeding the mishap. \"Surrender, Levi,\" said Shorty, running up. \"Certainly, my tear poy,\" said Rosenbaum. \"Anyding dat you vant. How are you, any vay? Say, dat vas a nead drick, vasn\u0027t it? Haf your horse sdumble unt trow you jest ad de righd dime unt place? It dook me a long dime to deach my horse dot. I\u0027m mighty glat to see you.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63251.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
