{"id":45146,"no":111,"title":"CHAPTER II. SI AND SHORTY COME VERY NEAR LOSING THEIR BOYS.","content":"ALL healthy boys have a strong tincture of the savage in them. The savage alternately worships his gods with blind, unreasoning idolatry, or treats them with measureless contumely. \n \n Boys do the same with their heroes. It is either fervent admiration, or profound distrust, merging into actual contempt. After the successful little skirmish with the guerrillas the boys were wild in their enthusiasm over Si and Shorty. They could not be made to believe that Gens. Grant, Sherman or Thomas could conduct a battle better. But the moment that Si and Shorty seemed dazed by the multitude into which they were launched, a revulsion of feeling developed, which soon threatened to be ruinous to the partners\u0027 ascendancy. \n \n During the uncomfortable, wakeful night the prestige of the partners still further diminished. In their absence the army had been turned topsy-turvy and reorganized in a most bewildering way. The old familiar guide-marks had disappeared. Two of the great corps had been abolished—consolidated into one, with a new number and a strange commander. Two corps of strange troops had come in from the Army of the Potomac, and had been consolidated into one, taking an old corps\u0027 number. Divisions, brigades and regiments had been totally changed in commanders, formation and position. Then the Army of the Tennessee had come in, to complicate the seeming muddle, and the more that Si and Shorty cross-questioned such stragglers as came by the clearer it seemed to the boys that they were hopelessly bewildered, and the more depressed the youngsters became. \n \n The morning brought no relief. Si and Shorty talked together, standing apart from the squad, and casting anxious glances over the swirling mass of army activity, which the boys did not fail to note and read with dismal forebodings. \n \n \"I do believe they\u0027re lost,\" whimpered little Pete Skidmore. \"What in goodness will ever become of us, if we\u0027re lost in this awful wilderness?\" \n \n The rest shuddered and grew pale at this horrible prospect. \n \n \"That looks like a brigade headquarters over there,\" said Si, pointing to the left. \"And I believe that\u0027s our old brigade flag. I\u0027m goin\u0027 over there to see.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t believe that\u0027s any brigade headquarters at all,\" said Shorty. \"Up there, to the right, looks ever so much more like a brigade headquarters. I\u0027m goin\u0027 up there to see. You boys stay right there, and don\u0027t move off the ground till I come back. I won\u0027t be gone long.\" \n \n As he left, the boys began to feel more lonely and hopeless than ever, and little Pete Skidmore had hard work to restrain his tears. \n \n A large, heavy-jowled man, with a mass of black whiskers, and wearing a showy but nondescript uniform, appeared. \n \n \"That must be one o\u0027 the big Generals,\" said Harry Joslyn. \"Looks like the pictures o\u0027 Grant. Git into line, boys, and salute.\" \n \n \"No, it ain\u0027t Grant, neither,\" said Gid Mackall. \"Too big. Must be Gen. Thomas.\" \n \n The awed boys made an effort to form a line and receive him properly. \n \n \"Who are you, boys?\" said the newcomer, after gravely returning the salute. \n \n \"We\u0027re recruits for the 200th Injianny Volunteer Infantry,\" answered Harry Joslyn. \"Kin you tell us where the rijimint is? We\u0027re lost. \n \n \"Used to know sich a regiment. In fact, I used to be Lieutenant-Colonel of it. But I hain\u0027t heared of it for a long time. Think it\u0027s petered out.\" \n \n \"Petered out!\" gasped the boys. \n \n \"Yes. It was mauled and mummixed to death. There\u0027s plenty o\u0027 mismanagement all around the army, but the 200th Injianny had the worst luck of all. It got into awful bad hands. I quit it just as soon\u0027s I see how things was a-going. They begun to plant the men just as soon\u0027s they crossed the Ohio, and their graves are strung all the way from Louisville to Chickamauga. The others got tired o\u0027 being mauled around, and starved, and tyrannized over, and o\u0027 fighting for the nigger, and they skipped for home like sensible men.\" \n \n The boys shuddered at the doleful picture. \n \n \"Who brung you here?\" continued the newcomer. \n \n \"Sarjint Klegg and Corpril Elliott,\" answered Harry. \n \n \"Holy smoke,\" said the newcomer with a look of disgust. \"They\u0027ve made non-commish out o\u0027 them sapsuckers. Why, I wouldn\u0027t let them do nothin\u0027 but dig ditches when I was in command o\u0027 the regiment. But they probably had to take them. All the decent material was gone. How much bounty\u0027d you get?\" \n \n \"We got $27.50 apiece,\" answered Harry. \"But we didn\u0027t care nothin\u0027 for the bounty. We—\" \n \n \"Only $27.50 apiece. Holy smoke! They\u0027re payin\u0027 10 times that in some places.\" \n \n \"I tell you, we didn\u0027t enlist for the bounty,\" reiterated Harry. \n \n \"All the same, you don\u0027t want to be robbed o\u0027 what\u0027s yours. You don\u0027t want to be skinned out o\u0027 your money by a gang o\u0027 snoozers who\u0027re gittin\u0027 rich off of green boys like you. Where\u0027s this Sarjint Klegg and Corpril Elliott that brung you here?\" \n \n \"They\u0027ve gone to look for the rijimint.\" \n \n \"Gone to look for the regiment. Much they\u0027ve gone to look for the regiment. They\u0027ve gone to look out for their scalawag selves. When you see \u0027em agin, you\u0027ll know \u0027em, that\u0027s all.\" \n \n Little Pete Skidmore began to whimper. \n \n \"Say, boys,\" continued the newcomer, \"you\u0027d better drop all idee of that 200th Injianny and come with me. If there is any sich a regiment any more, and you get to it, you\u0027d be sorry for it as long as you live. I know a man over here who\u0027s got a nice regiment, and wants a few more boys like you to fill it up. He\u0027ll treat you white and give you twice as much bounty as you\u0027ll git anywhere\u0027s else, and he\u0027s goin\u0027 to keep his regiment back in the fortifications, where there won\u0027t be no fightin\u0027, and hard marches, and starvation—\" \n \n \"But we enlisted to fight and march, and—\" interjected Harry. \n \n \"Well, you want a good breakfast just now, more\u0027n anything else, judgin\u0027 from appearances. Come along with me and I\u0027ll git you something to eat.\" \n \n \"But we waz enlisted for the 200th Injianny Volunteer Infantry, and must go to that rijimint,\" protested Monty Scruggs. \n \n \"Well, what\u0027s that got to do with your havin\u0027 a good breakfast?\" said the newcomer plausibly. \"You need that right off. Then we kin talk about your regiment. As a matter of fact, you\u0027re only enlisted in the Army of the United States and have the right to go to any regiment you please. Tyrannical as the officers may be, they can\u0027t take that privilege of an American freeman away from you. Come along and git breakfast first.\" \n \n The man\u0027s appearance was so impressive, his words and confident manner so convincing, and the boys so hungry that their scruples vanished, and all followed the late Lieut.-Col. Billings, as he gave the word, and started off through the mazes of the camp with an air of confident knowledge that completed his conquest of them. \n \n Ex-Lieut.-Col. Billings strode blithely along, feeling the gladsome exuberance of a man who had \"struck a good thing,\" and turning over in his mind as to where he had best market his batch of lively recruits, how he could get around the facts of their previous enlistment, and how much he ought to realize per head. He felt that he could afford to give the boys a good breakfast, and that that would be fine policy. Accordingly, he led the way to one of the numerous large eating houses, established by enterprising sutlers, to their own great profit and the shrinkage of the pay of the volunteers. He lined the boys up in front of the long shelf which served for a table and ordered the keeper: \n \n \"Now, give each of these boys a good breakfast of ham and eggs and trimmings and I\u0027ll settle for it.\" \n \n \"Good mornin\u0027, Kunnel. When \u0027d you git down here?\" said a voice at his elbow. \n \n \"Hello, Groundhog, is that you?\" said Billings, turning around. \"Just the man I wanted to see. Finish your breakfast and come out here. I want to talk to you.\" \n \n \"Well,\" answered Groundhog, wiping his mouth, \"I\u0027m through. The feller that runs this shebang ain\u0027t made nothin\u0027 offen me, I kin tell you. It\u0027s the first square meal I\u0027ve had for a week, and I\u0027ve et until there ain\u0027t a crack left inside o\u0027 me that a skeeter could git his bill in. I laid out to git the wuth o\u0027 my money, and I done it. What\u0027re you doin\u0027 down here in this hole? Ain\u0027t Injianny good enough for you?\" \n \n \"Injianny\u0027s good enough on general principles, but just now there\u0027s too much Abolition malaria there for me. The Lincoln satraps \u0027ve got the swing on me, and I thought I\u0027d take a change of air. I\u0027ve come down here to see if there weren\u0027t some chances to make a good turn, and I\u0027ve done very well so far. I\u0027ve done a little in cattle and got some cotton through the lines—enough at least to pay my board and railroad fare. But I think the biggest thing is in recruits, and I\u0027ve got a scheme which I may let you into. You know there are a lot of agents down here from the New England States trying to git niggers to fill up their quotas, and they are paying big money for recruits. Can\u0027t you go out and gether up a lot o\u0027 niggers that we kin sell \u0027em?\" \n \n \"Sure,\" said Groundhog confidently. \"Kin git all you want, if you\u0027ll pay for \u0027em. But what\u0027s this gang you\u0027ve got with you?\" \n \n \"O, they\u0027re a batch for that blasted Abolition outfit, the 200th Injianny. Them two ornery galoots, Si and Shorty, whose necks I ought\u0027ve broke when I was with the regiment, have brung \u0027em down. They\u0027re not goin\u0027 to git to the 200th Injianny if I kin help it, though. First place, it\u0027ll give old McBiddle, that Abolition varmint, enough to git him mustered as Colonel. He helped oust me, and I have it in for him. He was recommended for promotion for gittin\u0027 his arm shot off at Chickamauga. Wisht it\u0027d bin his cussed head.\" \n \n \"But what\u0027re you goin\u0027 to do with the gang?\" Groundhog inquired. \n \n \"O, there are two or three men around here that I kin sell \u0027em to for big money. I ought to make a clean thousand off \u0027em if I make a cent.\" \n \n \"How much\u0027ll I git out o\u0027 that?\" inquired Groundhog anxiously. \n \n \"Well, you ain\u0027t entitled to nothin\u0027 by rights. I\u0027ve hived this crowd all by myself, and kin work \u0027em all right. But if you\u0027ll come along and make any affidavits that we may need, I\u0027ll give you a sawbuck. But on the nigger lay I\u0027ll stand in even with you, half and half. You run \u0027em in and I\u0027ll place \u0027em and we\u0027ll whack up.\" \n \n \"\u0027Tain\u0027t enough,\" answered Groundhog angrily. \"Look here, Jeff Billings, I know you of old. You\u0027ve played off on me before, and I won\u0027t stand no more of it. Jest bekase you\u0027ve bin a Lieutenant-Colonel and me only a teamster you\u0027ve played the high and mighty with me. I\u0027m jest as good as you are any day. I wouldn\u0027t give a howl in the infernal regions for your promises. You come down now with $100 in greenbacks and I\u0027ll go along and help you all I kin. If you don\u0027t—\" \n \n \"If I don\u0027t what\u0027ll you do, you lowlived whelp?\" said Billings, in his usual brow-beating manner. \"I only let you into this as a favor, because I\u0027ve knowed you before. You hain\u0027t brains enough to make a picayune yourself, and hain\u0027t no gratitude when someone else makes it for you. Git out o\u0027 here; I\u0027m ashamed to be seen speakin\u0027 to a mangy hound like you. Git out o\u0027 here before I kick you out. Don\u0027t you dare speak to one o\u0027 them boys, or ever to me agin. If you do I\u0027ll mash you. Git out.\" \n \n Si and Shorty\u0027s dismay when they returned and found their squad entirely disappeared was overwhelming. They stood and gazed at one another for a minute in speechless alarm and wonderment. \n \n \"Great goodness,\" gasped Si at length, \"they can\u0027t have gone far. They must be somewhere around.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t know about that,\" said Shorty despairingly. \"We\u0027ve bin gone some little time and they\u0027re quick-footed little rascals.\" \n \n \"What fools we wuz to both go off and leave \u0027em,\" murmured Si in deep contrition. \"What fools we wuz.\" \n \n \"No use o\u0027 cryin\u0027 over spilt milk,\" answered Shorty. \"The thing to do now is to find \u0027em, which is very much like huntin\u0027 a needle in a haystack. You stay here, on the chance o\u0027 them comin\u0027 back, and I\u0027ll take a circle around there to the left and look for \u0027em. If I don\u0027t find \u0027em I\u0027ll come back and we\u0027ll go down to the Provo-Marshal\u0027s.\" \n \n \"Goodness, I\u0027d rather be shot than go back to the rijimint without \u0027em,\" groaned Si. \"How kin I ever face the Colonel and the rest o\u0027 the boys?\" \n \n Leaving Si gazing anxiously in every direction for some clew to his missing youngsters, Shorty rushed off in the direction of the sutler\u0027s shanties, where instinct told him he was most likely to find the runaways. \n \n He ran up against Groundhog. \n \n \"Where are you goin\u0027 in sich a devil of a hurry?\" the teamster asked. \"Smell a distillery somewhere?\" \n \n \"Hello, Groundhog, is that you? Ain\u0027t you dead yit? Say, have you seen a squad o\u0027 recruits around here—all boys, with new uniforms, and no letters or numbers on their caps?\" \n \n \"Lots and gobs of \u0027em. Camp\u0027s full of \u0027em. More comin\u0027 in by every train.\" \n \n \"But these wuz all Injianny boys, most of \u0027em little. Not an old man among \u0027em.\" \n \n \"Shorty, I know where your boys are. What\u0027ll you give me to tell you?\" \n \n Shorty knew his man of old, and just the basis on which to open negotiations. \n \n \"Groundhog, I\u0027ve just had my canteen filled with first-class whisky—none o\u0027 your commissary rotgut, but old rye, hand-made, fire-distilled. I got it to take out to the boys o\u0027 the rijimint to celebrate my comin\u0027 back. Le\u0027 me have just one drink out of it, and I\u0027ll give it to you if you\u0027ll tell.\" \n \n Groundhog wavered an instant. \"I wuz offered $10 on the other side.\" \n \n Shorty was desperate. \"I\u0027ll give you the whisky and $10.\" \n \n \"Le\u0027 me see your money and taste your licker.\" \n \n \"Here\u0027s the money,\" said Shorty, showing a bill. \"I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to trust you with the canteen, but I\u0027ll pour out this big spoon full, which\u0027ll be enough for you to taste.\" Shorty drew a spoon from his haversack and filled it level full. \n \n \"It\u0027s certainly boss licker,\" said Groundhog, after he had drunk it, and prudently hefted the canteen to see if it was full. \"I\u0027ll take your offer. You\u0027re to have just one swig out o\u0027 it, and no more, and not a hog-swaller neither. I know you. You\u0027d drink that hull canteenful at one gulp, if you had to. You\u0027ll let me put my thumb on your throat?\" \n \n \"Yes, and I\u0027ll give you the canteen now and the money after we find the boys.\" \n \n \"All right. Go ahead. Drink quick, for you must go on the jump, or you\u0027ll lose your boys.\" \n \n Shorty lifted the canteen to his lips and Groundhog clasped his throat with his thumb on Adam\u0027s apple. When Shorty got his breath he sputtered: \n \n \"Great Jehosephat, you didn\u0027t let me git more\u0027n a spoonful. But where are the boys?\" \n \n \"Old Jeff Billings\u0027s got \u0027em down at Zeke Wiggins\u0027s hash-foundry feedin\u0027 \u0027em, so\u0027s he kin toll \u0027em off into another rijimint.\" \n \n \"Old Billings agin,\" shouted Shorty in a rage. \"Where\u0027s the place? Show it to me. But wait a minute till I run back and git my pardner.\" \n \n \"Gi\u0027 me that licker fust,\" shouted Groundhog, but Shorty was already running back for Si. When he returned with him he threw the canteen to Groundhog with the order, \"Go ahead and show us the place.\" \n \n By the time they came in sight of the sutler\u0027s shanty the boys had finished their breakfast and were moving off after Billings. \n \n \"There\u0027s your man and there\u0027s your boys,\" said Groundhog, pointing to them. \"Now gi\u0027 me that \u0027ere sawbuck. You\u0027ll have to excuse me havin\u0027 anything to do with old Billings. He\u0027s licked me twice already.\" \n \n Shorty shoved the bill into his hand, and rushed down in front of Billings. \n \n \"Here, you black-whiskered old roustabout, where \u0027re you takin\u0027 them boys?\" he demanded. \n \n \"Git out o\u0027 my way, you red-headed snipe,\" answered Billings, making a motion as if to brush him away. \n \n \"If you don\u0027t go off and leave them boys alone I\u0027ll belt you over the head with my gun,\" said Si, raising his musket. \n \n \"You drunken maverick,\" answered Billings, trying to brave it out. \"I\u0027ll have you shot for insultin\u0027 and threatenin\u0027 your sooperior officer. Skip out o\u0027 here before the Provo comes up and ketches you. Let me go on about my business. Forward, boys.\" \n \n \"Officer nothin\u0027. You can\u0027t play that on us,\" said Si. \"Halt, there, boys, and stand fast.\" \n \n A crowd of teamsters, sutlers\u0027 men and other camp followers gathered around. A tall, sandybearded man with keen, gray eyes and a rugged, stony face rode up. He wore a shabby slouch hat, his coat was old and weather-stained, but he rode a spirited horse. \n \n \"Here, what\u0027s all this row about?\" he asked in quick, sharp tones. \n \n \"Keep out o\u0027 this mix,\" said Shorty, without looking around. \"\u0027Tain\u0027t none o\u0027 your business. This is our party.\" With that he made a snatch at Billings\u0027s collar to jerk him out of the way. \n \n \"What, you rascal, would you assault an officer?\" said the newcomer, spurring his horse through the crowd to get at Shorty. \n \n He Ain\u0027t No Officer 27 \n \n \"He ain\u0027t no officer, General,\" said Si, catching sight of two dim stars on the man\u0027s shoulders. \"He\u0027s tryin\u0027 to steal our recruits from us.\" \n \n \"Yes, I am an officer,\" said Billings, avoiding Shorty\u0027s clutch. \"These men are assaultin\u0027 me while I\u0027m on duty. I want them arrested and punished.\" \n \n \"Fall back there, both of you,\" said the General severely, as Si and Shorty came to a present arms. \"Sergeant, who are you, and where do you belong?\" \n \n \"I\u0027m Serg\u0027t Klegg, sir, of Co. Q, 200th Injianny Volunteer Infantry.\" \n \n \"Who are you, Corporal?\" \n \n \"I\u0027m Corp\u0027l Elliott, sir, of Co. Q, 200th Injianny Volunteer Infantry.\" \n \n \"Now, officer, who are you?\" \n \n \"I\u0027m Lieut.-Col. Billings, sir.\" \n \n \"Where\u0027s your shoulder-straps?\" \n \n \"I had \u0027em taken off this coat to git fixed. They were torn.\" \n \n \"Where\u0027s your sword?\" \n \n \"I left it in my quarters.\" \n \n \"Fine officer, to go on duty that way. Where do you belong?\" \n \n Billings hesitated an instant, but he felt sure that the General did not belong to the Army of the Cumberland, and he answered: \n \n \"I belong to the 200th Ind.\" \n \n \"That ain\u0027t true, General,\" Si protested. \"He was fired out of the regiment a year ago. He\u0027s a citizen.\" \n \n \"Silence, Sergeant. Billings? Billings? The name of the Lieutenant-Colonel of the 200th Ind. happens to be McBiddle—one-armed man, good soldier. Billings? Billings? T. J. Billings? Is that your name?\" \n \n \"Yes, sir,\" answered Billings, beginning to look very uncomfortable. \n \n \"Didn\u0027t you have some trouble about a bunch of cattle you sold to the Quartermaster-General?\" \n \n \"Well, there was little difference of opinion, but—\" \n \n \"That\u0027ll do, sir. That\u0027ll do for the present. I begin to get you placed. I thought I knew the name Billings as soon as you spoke it, but I couldn\u0027t remember any officer in my army of that name. Now, Sergeant, tell me your story.\" \n \n \"General, me and my pardner here,\" began Si, \"have bin home on wounded furlough. Wounded at Chickamauga and promoted. We got orders to bring on this squad o\u0027 recruits from Jeffersonville for our rijimint. We got in last night and this mornin\u0027 me and my pardner started out to see if we could find someone to direct us to the rijimint, leavin\u0027 the squad alone for a few minutes. While we wuz gone this feller, who\u0027s bin fired out of our rijimint and another one that he was in, come along and tolled our boys off, intendin\u0027 to sneak \u0027em into another rijimint and git pay for \u0027em. By great good luck we ketched him in time, just before you come up. You kin ask the boys themselves if I hain\u0027t told you the truth.\" \n \n \"Good idea,\" said the General, in his quick, peremptory way. \"You three (indicating Si, Shorty and Billings) march off there 25 paces, while I talk to the boys.\" \n \n Gen. Sherman, for it was the Commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi, who, with his usual impetuous, thorough way, would investigate even the most insignificant affair in his camps, when the humor seized him, now sprang from his horse, and began a sharp, nervous cross-questioning of the boys as to their names, residence, ages, how they came there and whither they were bound. \n \n \"You came down with this Sergeant and Corporal, did you? You were recruited for the 200th Ind., were you? You were put under the charge of those men to be taken to your regiment?\" he asked Pete Skidmore, at the end of the line. \n \n \"Yes, sir,\" blubbered Pete. \"And they are always losin\u0027 us, particularly me, durn \u0027em. Spite of all I kin say to \u0027em they\u0027ll lose me, durn their skins.\" \n \n \"No, my boy, you sha\u0027n\u0027t be lost,\" said the General kindly, as he remounted. \"Stick to our command and you\u0027ll come through all right. Billings, you thorough-paced rascal, I want you to get to the other side of the Ohio River as quickly as the trains will carry you. I haven\u0027t time to deal with you as you deserve, but if I have occasion to speak to you again you\u0027ll rue it as long as you live. There\u0027s a train getting ready to go out. If you are wise, you\u0027ll take it. Serg\u0027t Klegg and Corp\u0027l Elliott, you deserve to lose your stripes for both of you leaving your squad at the same time. See that you don\u0027t do it again. You\u0027ll find the 200th Ind. in camp on the east side of Mission Ridge, about a mile south of Rossville Gap. Go out this road until you pass old John Ross\u0027s house about a half a mile. You\u0027ll find several roads leading off to the right, but don\u0027t take any of them till you come to one that turns off by a sweet gum and a honey-locust standing together on the banks of a creek. Understand? A sweet gum and a honey-locust standing together on the banks of a creek. Turn off there, go across the mountain and you\u0027ll find your camp. Move promptly now.\" \n \n \"I declare,\" said a big Wagonmaster, as the General galloped off, \"if that old Gump Sherman don\u0027t beat the world. He not only knows where every regiment in his whole army is located, but I believe he knows every man in it. He\u0027s a far-reacher, I tell you.\" \n \n \"Great Jehosephat,\" gasped Shorty, \"was that Gen. Tecumseh Sherman?\" \n \n \"As sure \u0027s you\u0027re a foot high,\" replied the Wagonmaster. \n \n \"And I told him to mind his own business,\" stammered Shorty. \n \n \"Yes, and if it hadn\u0027t bin for him you\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 lost us, durn it,\" ejaculated little Pete Skidmore. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63298.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
