{"id":45148,"no":113,"title":"CHAPTER IV. THE RECRUITS ARE ASSIGNED TO COMPANIES.","content":"THE strangest feeling possessed Si and Shorty when once in the camp of their old regiment, and after the first hearty welcome of their comrades was over. There was a strangeness about everything that they could not comprehend. It was their regiment—the 200th Ind.; it was made up of the same companies, with the great majority of the men the same, but it was very far from being the 200th Ind. which crossed the Ohio River in September, 1862. Marvelous changes had been wrought by 18 months\u0027 tuition in the iron school of war, in the 10 separate herds of undisciplined farmer boys which originally constituted the regiment. Yellow, downy beards appeared on faces which had been of boyish smoothness when the river was crossed, but this was only one of the minor changes. There was an alertness, a sureness, a self-confidence shining from eyes which was even more marked. Every one carried himself as if he knew precisely what he was there for, and intended doing it. There was enough merriment around camp, but it was very different from the noisy rollicking of the earlier days. The men who had something to do were doing it with systematic earnestness; the men who had nothing to do were getting as much solid comfort and fun as the situation afforded. The frothy element among officers and men had been rigorously weeded out or repressed. All that remained were soldiers in the truest sense of the word. The change had been very great even since the regiment had lined up for the fearful ordeal of Chickamauga. \"Did you ever see a gang o\u0027 half-baked kids get to be men as quick as these boys?\" Si asked Shorty. \"Think o\u0027 the awkward squads that used to be continually fallin\u0027 over their own feet, and stabbing theirselves with their own bayonets.\" \"Seems so,\" answered Shorty, \"but I don\u0027t know that they\u0027ve growed any faster\u0027n we have. Walt Slusser, who\u0027s bin Orderly at Headquarters, says that he heard Capt. McGillicuddy tell Col. McBiddle that he\u0027d never seen men come out as me and you had, and he thought we\u0027d make very effective noncommish.\" \"Probably we\u0027ve all growed,\" Si assented thoughtfully. \"Just think o\u0027 McBiddle as Lieutenant-Colonel, in place o\u0027 old Billings. Remember the first time we saw McBiddle to know him? That time he was Sergeant o\u0027 the Guard before Perryville, and was so gentle and soft-spoken that lots o\u0027 the boys fooled themselves with the idee that he lacked sand. Same fellers thought that old bellerin\u0027 bull Billings was a great fightin\u0027 man. What chumps we all wuz that we stood Billings a week.\" \"Wonder if I\u0027m ever goin\u0027 to have a chanst for a little private sociable with Billings? Just as I think I\u0027m goin\u0027 to have it, something interferes. That feller\u0027s bin so long ripe for a lickin\u0027 that I\u0027m afraid he\u0027ll be completely spiled before my chanst comes.\" \"But I can\u0027t git over missin\u0027 so many familiar voices in command, and hearin\u0027 others in their places,\" said Si. \"That battalion drill they wuz havin\u0027 as we come in didn\u0027t sound like our rijimint at all. I could always tell which was our rijimint drillin\u0027 half a mile away by the sound of the voices. What a ringin\u0027 voice Capt. Scudder had. It beat the bugle. You could hear him sing out, \u0027Co. C, on right, into line! Forward, guide right—March!\u0027 farther\u0027n you could the bugle. The last time I heard him wuz as we wuz\u0027 going up Snodgrass Hill. A rebel bullet went through his head just as he said, \u0027March!\u0027 Now, Lieut. Scripps is in command o\u0027 Co. C, and he\u0027s got a penny-whistle voice that I can\u0027t git used to.\" \"Lieut. Scripps\u0027s a mighty good man. He\u0027ll take Co. C as far as Capt. Scudder would.\" \"I know that Scripps\u0027s all right. No discount on him. But it don\u0027t seem natural, that\u0027s all. Every one o\u0027 the companies except ours has a new man in command, and in ours Capt. McGillicuddy\u0027s voice has got a different ring to it than before Chickamaugy.\" \"Practicin\u0027 to command the battalion,\" suggested Shorty. \"You know he\u0027ll be Major if McBiddle\u0027s made a full Kurnel.\" \"That reminds me,\" said Shorty, \"that our squad o\u0027 recruits\u0027ll probably fill up the rijimint so\u0027s to give McBiddle his eagle. They\u0027ll be \u0027round presently to divide up the squad and assign \u0027em to companies. As all the companies is about equally strong, they\u0027ll divide \u0027em equally—that\u0027ll make six and one-half boys to each company. Capt. McGillicuddy bein\u0027 the senior Captain, is to have first choice. We want to pick out the best six and one-half for our company and put \u0027em in one squad at the right or left, and give the Captain the wink to choose \u0027em.\" \"If we do it\u0027s got to be done mighty slick,\" said Si. \"They\u0027re all mighty good boys, and spunky. They\u0027ll all want to go with us, and if they find out we\u0027ve made any choice they\u0027ll never forgive us. I\u0027d a\u0027most as soon have one six boys as another, yit if I had to pick out six I believe I\u0027d take Harry Joslyn, Gid Mackall, Alf Russell, Monty Scruggs, Jim Humphreys and Sandy Baker.\" \"And Pete Skidmore,\" added Shorty. \"We\u0027ve got to take special care o\u0027 that little rat. Besides, I want to. Somehow I\u0027ve took quite a fancy to the brat.\" \"Yes, we must take little Pete,\" assented Si. \"The proportion\u0027s six and one-half to a company. He \u0027ll pass for the half man. But it won\u0027t do to let him know it. He thinks he\u0027s as big as any man in the rijimint. But how\u0027re we goin\u0027 to fix it not to let the other boys know that we\u0027ve picked \u0027em out?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what we\u0027ll do,\" said Shorty, the man of many wiles. \"When the boys are drawed up in line and Capt. McGillicuddy goes down it to pick \u0027em out, you stand at attention, two paces in front, facin\u0027 \u0027em and lookin\u0027 as severe and impartial as a judge on the bench. I\u0027ll stand behind you with my leg against your\u0027n, this way, and apparently fixing my gun-lock. When Cap comes in front o\u0027 one that we want, yo give me a little hunch with your leg, and I\u0027ll make the lock click.\" \"Splendid idee,\" said Si. \"I\u0027ll go and post the Cap while you git the boys into line.\" When Shorty returned to the squad he found them in feverish excitement about the distribution to the different companies. As he and Si had apprehended, all were exceedingly anxious to go with them into Co. Q, which Si and Shorty had unwittingly impressed upon them was the crack company of the regiment, and contained the very cream of the men. To be assigned to any other company seemed to them, if not an actual misfortune, a lack of good luck. \"Nonsense,\" Shorty replied to their eager entreaties; \"all the companies in the 200th Injianny is good, prime, first-class—better\u0027n the companies in ary other rijimint. You\u0027re playin\u0027 in great luck to git into any one o\u0027 \u0027em, I tell you. You might\u0027ve got into one o\u0027 \u0027em rijimints that\u0027re back there at Nashville guardin\u0027 fortifications, or one o\u0027 \u0027em that lost their colors at Chickamaugy. I\u0027d ruther be the tail end o\u0027 the 200th Injianny, than the Drum Major o\u0027 any other.\" \"That\u0027s all right,\" they shouted. \"We\u0027re glad we\u0027re in the 200th Injianny, but we want to be in Co. Q.\" \"Well, you can\u0027t all be in Co. Q. Only six and one-half of you. The rest\u0027s got to go to other companies.\" \"Say, Corpril,\" spoke up Harry Joslyn, \"you\u0027ll see that I git in, won\u0027t you? You know I shot that rebel at the burnt bridge.\" \"And didn\u0027t I shoot one, too?\" put in Gid Mackall. \"Just as much as you did. They want tall men in the company, don\u0027t they, Corpril? Not little runts.\" \"And didn\u0027t I watch the crossing down there at the burnt bridge?\" pleaded Jim Humphreys. \"And git scared to death by a nigger huntin\u0027 coons,\" laughed the others. \"Who kept the rebel from gittin\u0027 back to the train and settin\u0027 it on fire, but me and Sandy Baker?\" piped up little Pete Skidmore. \"Who got lost, and nearly killed by a locomotive. Don\u0027t that count for nothin\u0027?\" You\u0027ve Lost Little Pete 51 \"Boys,\" said Shorty, leaning on his musket, and speaking with the utmost gravity, \"this\u0027s a great military dooty and must be performed without fear, favor nor affection. I\u0027d like to have you all in Co. Q, but this\u0027s a thing \u0027bout which I hain\u0027t got no say. There\u0027s a great many things in the army \u0027bout which a Corpril hain\u0027t as much inflooence as he orter have, as you\u0027ll find out later on. Here comes the Captain o\u0027 Co. Q, who, because o\u0027 his rank, has the first pick o\u0027 the recruits. He\u0027s never seen you before, and don\u0027t know one o\u0027 you from Adam\u0027s off-ox. He has his own ideas as to who he wants in the company, and what he says goes. It may be that the color o\u0027 your hair\u0027ll decide him, mebbe the look in your eyes, mebbe the shape o\u0027 your noses. \u0027Tention! Right dress! Front! Saloot!\" Capt. McGillicuddy came down at the head of the company officers of the regiment, and took a comprehensive survey of the squad. \"Fine-looking lot of youngsters,\" he remarked. \"They\u0027ll make good soldiers.\" \"Every one o\u0027 them true-blue, all wool and a yard wide. Captain,\" said Si. \"You\u0027ll play fair, now, Captain, won\u0027t you, and choose for yourself?\" said Capt. Scripps. \"I\u0027ve no doubt they\u0027re all good boys, but there\u0027s a choice in good boys, and that Sergeant of yours has learned where the choice is. You let him stay back, while you go down the line yourself.\" \"Certainly,\" replied Capt. McGillicuddy. \"Serg\u0027t Klegg, stay where you are.\" Si saluted and took his position, facing the line, with a look of calm impartiality upon his face. Shorty turned around and backed up to him so that the calves of their legs touched, and began intently studying his gunlock. Capt. McGillicuddy stepped over to the right of the line stopped in front of Harry Joslyn and Gid Mackall. Shorty full-cocked his gun with two sharp clicks. \"You two step forward one pace,\" said Capt. McGillicuddy to the two radiant boys, who obeyed with a jump. The Captain walked on down the line, carefully scrutinizing each one, but did not stop until Shorty\u0027s gun clicked twice, when he was in front of Alf Russell and Monty Scruggs. \"Step forward one pace,\" he commanded. He proceeded on down the line until he came in front of Jim Humphreys and Sandy Baker, when Shorty\u0027s gun clicked again. \"You two step forward one pace,\" he commanded. \"Gentleman, I\u0027ve got my six. The rest are yours.\" \"But you hain\u0027t got me. You\u0027ve lost me,\" screamed Pete Skidmore, dismayed at being separated from Sandy Baker. Shorty\u0027s gun clicked again. \"I believe that there is a fraction of a half a man to be distributed around,\" the Captain said, turning to the other officers. \"We agreed to draw cuts for that choice. But as that\u0027s the smallest boy in the lot I\u0027ll take him for my fraction. I think that\u0027s fair. Step forward, there, you boy on the left.\" \"All right Captain,\" laughed Capt. Scripps. \"You\u0027ve got the pick of the men, and I\u0027m glad of it. \"I know you have, for I\u0027ve been watching that Corporal of yours. I know him of old. I\u0027ve played cards too often with Shorty not to keep my eye on him whenever he is around. I saw through that gun-lock trick.\" \"The trouble with you fellows,\" responded Capt. McGillicuddy, \"is that you are constantly hunting around for some reason rather than the real one for Co. Q being always ahead of you. It isn\u0027t my fault that Co. Q is the best company in the regiment. It simply comes natural to the men that make up the company. You gentlemen divide up the rest among you, and then come down to the sutler\u0027s and we\u0027ll talk the matter over. Serg\u0027t Klegg, take these men down to the company and have the Orderly provide for them.\" \"Hello, awful glad to see you back—and you, too, Shorty,\" said the busy Orderly-Sergeant, speaking in his usual short, snappy sentences, without using any more words than absolutely necessary. \"We need you. Short of non-commish. Two Sergeants off on detached duty and two Corporals in hospital. Being worked for all we\u0027re worth. Both of you look fine. Had a nice, long rest. In great shape for work. Pitch in, now, and help me. First, let\u0027s get the names of these kids on the roll. Humphreys—we\u0027ve got two other Humphreys, so you\u0027ll answer to Humphreys, 3d. \"But I don\u0027t want to be with the Humphreys, sir,\" broke in Jim. \"Me and Monty Scruggs—\" \"Hold your tongue,\" said the Orderly sharply. \"Don\u0027t interrupt me. If you speak when you\u0027re spoken to you\u0027ll do all the talking expected of you. \"Joslyn, you\u0027re after Jones, 3d. M—M—Mackall, you come after Lawrence.\" \"But you\u0027ve put me after Joslyn,\" protested Gid. \"He\u0027s never ahead of me.\" \"Shut up,\" answered the Orderly. \"I do the talking for this company. Russell, Scruggs, Skidmore; there, I\u0027ve got \u0027em all down. Si, go down toward Co. A and find Bill Stiles and walk him up to the guard-tent and leave him there to cool off. He\u0027s got his hide full of coffin varnish somewhere, and of course wants to settle an old score with that Co. A man, who\u0027ll likely knock his head off if he catches him. Shorty, go back there to the cook tent and shake up those cooks. Give it to them, for they\u0027re getting lazier every day. I want supper ready as soon\u0027s we come off dress parade. Here, you boys, trot along after me to the Quartermaster\u0027s tent, and draw your blankets, tents, haversacks and canteens. Shorty, as soon\u0027s you\u0027re through with the cooks, go to the left of the company and start to fixing up a place for these boys\u0027 tents. Si, get back as soon\u0027s you can, for I want you to take the squad down after rations. Then you\u0027ll have to relieve Jake Warder as Sergeant of the Guard, for Jake\u0027s hardly able to be around.\" The Orderly strode off toward the Quartermaster\u0027s tent at such a pace that it gave the boys all they could do to keep up with him. Arriving there he called out sharply to the Quartermaster-Sergeant: \"Wes, give me seven blankets.\" That official responded by tossing the required number, one after another, counting them as he did so. As the Orderly caught them he tossed them to the boys, calling their names. Gid Mackall happened to be looking at a battery of artillery when his name was called, and received the blanket on the back of his neck, knocking him over. \"\u0027Tend to your business, there; don\u0027t be gawking around,\" said the Orderly sternly. \"Now, Wes, seven halves of pup-tents.\" These were tossed and counted the same way. Then followed canteens, haversacks and tin plates and cups. \"Now, boys, there\u0027s your kits. Give you your guns tomorrow. Hurry back to the company street and set up those tents on railroad time, for it\u0027s going to rain. Jump, now.\" When they reached Shorty he hustled them around to pitch their tents, but he was not fast enough to please the Orderly, who presently appeared, with the remark: \"Cesar\u0027s ghost. Shorty, how slow you are. Are you going to be all night getting up two or three tents? Get a move on you, now, for there\u0027s a rain coming up, and besides I want you for something else as soon\u0027s you\u0027re through with this?\" \"Who is that man, Corpril?\" asked Monty Scruggs, as the Orderly left. \"That\u0027s the Orderly-Sergeant of Co. Q.\" \"Orderly-Sergeant?\" repeated Monty dubiously. \"Who\u0027s he? I\u0027ve heard of Captains, Majors, Colonels and Generals, but never of Orderly-Sergeants, and yit he seems to be bigger\u0027n all of \u0027em. He has more to say, and does more orderin\u0027 around than all of \u0027em put together. He even orders you and Sarjint Klegg. Is he the biggest man in the army?\" \"Well, SO far\u0027s you\u0027re concerned and to all general purposes he is. You needn\u0027t pay no partickler attention as a rule to nobody else, but when the Orderly speaks, you jump, and the quicker you jump the better it\u0027ll be for you. He don\u0027t draw as much salary, nor put on as many frills as the bigger fellers, but you hain\u0027t nothin\u0027 to do with that. You kin find fault with the Captain, criticize the Kurnel, and lampoon the General, but you don\u0027t want to give the Orderly no slack. He\u0027s not to be fooled with. Russell, run up there and snatch that spade to dig ditches around these tents.\" \"When I enlisted,\" Monty confided to Alf Russell, \"I thought I\u0027d do my best to become a Captain or a General. Now, I\u0027m dead anxious to be an Orderly-Sarjint.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63300.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
