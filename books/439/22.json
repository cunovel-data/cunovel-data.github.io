SI AND SHORTY WERE RAPIDLY LEARNING","content":"THE GREAT MILITARY TRUTH \\n\\n \\n\\n THAT IN THE ARMY THE MOST LIKELY THING TO HAPPEN IS SOMETHING ENTIRELY UNLIKELY. \\n\\n \\n\\n COL. TERRENCE P. McTARNAGHAN, as his name would indicate, had first opened his eyes where the blue heavens bend over the evergreen sod of Ireland. Naturally, therefore, he thought himself a born soldier, and this conviction had been confirmed by a year\u0027s service as Second Lieutenant of Volunteers in the Mexican War, and subsequent connection with the Indiana Militia. Being an Irishman, when he went in for anything, and especially soldiering, he went in with all his might. He had associated with Regular Army officers whenever there was an opportunity, and he looked up to them with the reverence and emulation that an amateur gives to a professional. Naturally he shared their idea that an inspection and parade was the summit of military art. Consequently, the main thing to make the 200th Ind. the regiment it should be were frequent and rigid inspections. \\n\\n \\n\\n Fine weather, two days of idleness, and the prospect that the regiment would remain there some time watching the crossing of the Cumberland were enough and more than enough to set the Colonel going. The Adjutant published the following order: \\n\\n \\n\\n Headquarters 200th Indiana, \\n\\n In the Field, on the Cumberland, \\n\\n \\n\\n Nov. 25, 1862. \\n\\n \\n\\n I. The Regiment will be paraded for inspection tomorrow \\n\\n afternoon at 4 o\u0027clock. \\n\\n \\n\\n II. Captains will be expected to parade the full strength of \\n\\n their companies. \\n\\n \\n\\n III. A half hour before the parade. Captains will form their \\n\\n companies in the company streets and inspect every man. \\n\\n \\n\\n IV. The men will be required to have their clothes neatly \\n\\n brushed, blouses buttoned up, clean underclothes, shoes \\n\\n blacked, letters and numbers polished, and arms and \\n\\n accouterments in best condition. They will wear white \\n\\n gloves. \\n\\n \\n\\n V. The man who has his clothes, arms and accouterments in \\n\\n the best order will be selected for the Colonel\u0027s Orderly. \\n\\n \\n\\n By command of \\n\\n \\n\\n Attest: COL. TERRENCE P. McTARNAGHAN, Colonel. \\n\\n \\n\\n B. B. LAUGHLIN, Adjutant. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Capt. McGillicuddy marched Co. Q back to its street, he called attention to the order with a few terse admonitions as to what it meant to every one. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Get at this as soon as you break ranks, boys,\" urged the Captain. \"You can do a whole lot between now and tattoo. The others will, and you must not let them get ahead of you. No straw in knapsacks this time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Company spirit was high, and it would be little short of a calamity to have Co. Q beaten in anything. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a rush to the Sutler for white gloves, blacking, needles, thread, paper collars, sweet oil and rotten stone for the guns. \\n\\n \\n\\n That genial bird of prey added 50 per cent to his prices, because it was the first business he had done for some weeks; 50 per cent more for keeping open in the evening, another 50 per cent for giving credit till pay day, and still another for good will. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Government had just offered some very tempting gold-interest bonds, of which he wanted a swad. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Tain\u0027t right to let them green boys have their hull $13 a month to waste in foolishness,\" he said. \"Some good man should gather it up and make a right use of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Like Indiana farmer boys of his class. Si Klegg was cleanly but not neat. Thanks to his mother and sisters, his Sunday clothes were always \"respectable,\" and he put on a few extra touches when he expected to meet Annabel. He took his first bath for the year in the Wabash a week or two after the suckers began to run, and his last just before the water got so cold as to make the fish bite freely. \\n\\n \\n\\n Such a thing as a \"dandy\" was particularly distasteful to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shorty,\" said Si, as he watched some of the boys laboring with sandpaper, rotten stone and oil to make the gunbarrels shine like silver, \"what\u0027s the cense o\u0027 bein\u0027 so partickler about the outside of a gun? The business part\u0027s inside. Making them screw heads look like beads don\u0027t make it no surer of gitting Mr. Butternut.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Trouble about you folks on the Wabash,\" answered Shorty, as he twisted a screw head against some emery paper, \"is that you don\u0027t pay enough attention to style. Style goes a long ways in this vain and wicked world,\" (and his eyes became as if meditating on worlds he had known which were not so vain and wicked), \"and when I see them Kokomo persimmon knockers of Co. B hustling to put on frills, I\u0027m going to beat \u0027em if I don\u0027t lay up a cent.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Same here,\" said Si, falling to work on his gunbarrel. \"Just as\u0027 nice people moved into Posey County as squatted in Kokomo. Gang o\u0027 hoss thieves first settled Howard County.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Recollect that big two fister from Kokomo who said he\u0027d knock your head off if you ever throwed that up to him again?\" grinned Shorty. \"You invited him to try it on, an\u0027 he said your stripes stopped him. You pulled off your blouse, and you said you had no stripes on your shirt sleeves. But I wouldn\u0027t say it again until those Co. B fellers try again to buck us out of our place in the ration line. It\u0027s too good a slam to waste.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Tattoo sounded before they had finished their guns and accouterments. These were laid aside to be completed in the full light of day. \\n\\n \\n\\n The next morning work was resumed with industry stimulated by reports of the unusual things being done by the other companies. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This Tennessee mud sticks closer\u0027n a $500 mortgage to a 40-acre tract,\" sighed Si, as he stopped beating and brushing his blouse and pantaloons. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Or, \\n\\n \"\u0027Aunt Jemima\u0027s plaster, \\n\\n \"The more you try to pull it off the more it sticks \\n\\n the faster.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n hummed Shorty, with what breath he had left from his violent exercise. \\n\\n \\n\\n So well did they work that by dinner time they felt ready for inspection, careful reconnoissances of the other companies showing them to have no advantages. \\n\\n \\n\\n Next to the Sutler\u0027s for the prescribed white gloves. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si\u0027 had never worn anything on his hands but warm, woolen mittens knit for him by his mother, but the order said white gloves, and gloves they must have. The accommodating sutler made another stoppage in their month\u0027s pay of $1 for a pair of cheap, white cotton gloves. By this time the sutler had accumulated enough from the 200th Ind. to secure quite a handful of gold interest-bearing bonds. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, what do you think of them. Si?\" said Shorty, as he worked his generous hands into a pair of the largest sized gloves and held them up to view. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If they were only painted yaller and had a label on them,\" said Si, \"they could be issued for Cincinnati canvas covered hams.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty\u0027s retort was checked by hearing the bugle sound the officers\u0027 call. The Colonel announced to them that owing to the threatening look of the skies the parade and inspection would take place in an hour. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was feverish haste to finish undone things, but when Capt. McGillicuddy looked over his men in the company street, he declared himself proud to stack up Co. Q against any other in the regiment. Gun barrels and bayonets shone like silver, rammers rang clear, and came out without a stain to the Captain\u0027s white gloves. \\n\\n \\n\\n The band on the parade ground struck up the rollicking \\n\\n \\n\\n \"O, ain\u0027t I glad to git out of the wilderness, \\n\\n Out of the wilderness-Out of the wilderness,\" \\n\\n \\n\\n and Capt. McGillicuddy marched proudly out at the head of 75 broad-shouldered, well-thewed young Indianians, fit and fine as any south of the Ohio. \\n\\n \\n\\n The guides, holding their muskets butts up, indicated where the line was to form, the trim little Adjutant, glorious as the day in a new uniform and full breasted as a pouter-pigeon, was strutting over toward the band, and the towering red-headed Colonel, martial from his waving plume to his jangling spurs, stood before his tent in massive dignity, waiting for the color company to come up and receive the precious regimental standard. \\n\\n \\n\\n This scene of orderly pomp and pageantry was rudely disturbed by an Aid dashing in on a sweating horse, and calling out to the statuesque commander: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Colonel, a train is stalled in the creek about three miles from here, and is threatened with capture by Morgan\u0027s cavalry. The General presents his compliments, and directs that you take your regiment on the double-quick to the assistance of the train. You v\u0027e not a moment lose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tare and \u0027ounds!\" swore the Colonel in the classic he used when excited, \"am I niver to have a dacint inspection? Orderly, bring me me harse. Stop that band\u0027s ijiotic blatting. Get into line there, quick as love will let you, you unblessed Indiana spalpeans. Without doubling; right face! Forward, M-a-r-c-h!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Col. McTarnaghan, still wearing his parade grandeur, was soon at the head of the column, on that long-striding horse which always set such a hot pace for the regiment; especially over such a rough, gullied road as they were now traveling. \\n\\n \\n\\n Still, the progress was not fast enough to suit the impatient Colonel, who had an eye to the report he would have to make to the Brigadier General, who was a Regular. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Capt. McGillicuddy,\" commanded he, turning in his saddle, \"send forward a Corporal and five men for an advance guard.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Corporal Klegg, take five men and go to the front,\" commanded the Captain. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now you b\u0027yes, get ahead as fast as you can. Get a move on them durty spalpanes of tamesters. We must get back to camp before this storm strikes us. Shove out, now, as if the divil or Jahn Morgan was after yez.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was awful double-quicking over that rocky, rutty road, but taking Shorty and four others. Si went on the keen jump to arrive hot and breathless on the banks of the creek. There he found a large bearded man wearing an officer\u0027s slouched hat sitting on a log, smoking a black pipe, and gazing calmly on the ruck of wagons piled up behind one stalled in the creek, which all the mules they could hitch to it had failed to pull out. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was the Wagon Master, and his calmness was that of exhaustion. He had yelled and sworn himself dry, and was collecting another fund of abuse to spout at men and animals. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here, why don\u0027t you git a move on them wagons?\" said Si hotly, for he was angered at the man\u0027s apparent indifference. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Tend to your own business and I\u0027ll tend to mine,\" said the Wagon Master, sullenly, without removing his pipe or looking at Si. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look here, I\u0027m a Corporal, commanding the advance guard,\" said Si. \"I order you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This seemed to open the fountains of the man\u0027s soul. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You order me?\" he yelled, \"you splay-footed, knock-kneed, chuckled-headed paper-collared, whitegloved sprat from a milk-sick prairie. Corporal! I outrank all the Corporals from here to Christmas of next year.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The gentleman seems to have something on his mind,\" grinned Shorty. \"Mebbe his dinner didn\u0027t set well.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Shorty?\" inquired Si, \"how does a Wagon Master rank? Seems to me nobody lower\u0027n a Brigadier-General should dare talk to me that way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dunno,\" answered Shorty, doubtfully. \"Seems as if I\u0027d heard some of them Wagon Masters rank as Kurnels. He swears like one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Corporal!\" shouted the Wagon Master with infinite scorn. \"Measly $2-a-month water toter for the camp-guard, order me!\" and he went off into a rolling stream of choice \"army language.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He must certainly be a Kurnel,\" said Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here,\" continued the Wagon Master, \"if you don\u0027t want them two shoat-brands jerked offen you, jump in and get them wagons acrost. That\u0027s what you were sent to do. Hump yourself, if you know what\u0027s good for you. I\u0027ve done all I can. Now it\u0027s your turn.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Dazed and awed by the man\u0027s authoritativeness the boys ran down to the water to see what was the trouble. \\n\\n \\n\\n They found the usual difficulty in Southern crossings. The stupid tinkerers with the road had sought to prevent it running down into the stream by laying a log at the edge of the water. This was an enormous one two feet in diameter, with a chuckhole before it, formed by the efforts of the teams to mount the log. The heavily laden ammunition wagon had its hub below the top of the log, whence no amount of mule-power could extricate it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si, with Indiana commonsense, saw that the only help was to push the wagon back and lay a pile of poles to make a gradual ascent. He and the rest laid their carefully polished muskets on dry leaves at the side, pulled off their white gloves, and sending two men to hunt thru the wagons for axes to cut the poles. Si and Shorty roused up the stupid teamsters to unhitch the mules and get them behind the wagon to pull it back. Alas for their carefully brushed pantaloons and well-blackened shoes, which did not last a minute in the splashing mud. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Wagon Master had in the meanwhile laid in a fresh supply of epithets and had a fresh batch to swear at. He stood up on the bank and yelled profane injunctions at the soldiers like a Mississippi River Mate at a boat landing. They would not work fast enough for him, nor do the right thing. \\n\\n \\n\\n The storm at last burst. November storms in Tennessee are like the charge of a pack of wolves upon a herd of buffalo. There are wild, furious rushes, alternating with calmer intervals. The rain came down for a few minutes as if it would beat the face off the earth, and the stream swelled into a muddy torrent. Si\u0027s paper collar and cuffs at once became pulpy paste, and his boiled shirt a clammy rag. In spite of this his temper rose to the boiling point as he struggled thru the sweeping rush of muddy water to get the other wagons out of the road and the ammunition wagon pulled back a little ways to allow the poles to be piled in front of it. \\n\\n \\n\\n The dashing downpour did not check the Wagon Master\u0027s flow of profanity. He only yelled the louder to make himself heard above the roar. The rain stopped for a few minutes as suddenly as it had begun and Col. McTarnaghan came up with all his parade finery drenched and dripping like the feathers of a prize rooster in a rainy barnyard. His Irish temper was at the steaming point, and he was in search of something to vent it on. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You blab-mouthed son of a thief,\" he shouted at the Wagon Master, \"what are you ordering my men around for? They are sent here to order you, not you to order them. Shut that ugly potato trap of yours and get down to work, or I\u0027ll wear my saber out on you. Get down there and put your own shoulders to the wheels, you misbegotten villain. Get down there into the water, I tell you. Corporal, see that he does his juty!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The Wagon Master slunk down the hill, where Shorty grabbed him by the collar and yanked him over to help push one of the wagons back. The other boys had meanwhile found axes, cut down and trimmed up some pine poles and were piling them into the chuckhole under Si\u0027s practical guidance. A double team was put on the ammunition wagon, and the rest of Co. Q came up wet, mad and panting. A rope was found and stretched ahead of the mules, on which the company lined itself, the Colonel took his place on the bank and gave the word, and with a mighty effort the wagon was dragged up the hill. Some other heavily loaded ammunition wagons followed. The whole regiment was now up, and the bigger part of it lined on the rope so that these wagons came up more easily, even tho the rain resumed its wicked pounding upon the clay soil. \\n\\n \\n\\n Wading around thru the whirling water. Si had discovered, to his discomfiture, that there was a narrow, crooked reef that had to be kept to. There were deep overturning holes on either side. Into one of these Si had gone, to come again floundering and spurting muddy water from his mouth. \\n\\n \\n\\n Shorty noted the place and took the first opportunity to crowd the Wagon Master into it. \\n\\n \\n\\n A wagon loaded with crackers and pork missed the reef and went over hopelessly on its side, to the rage of Col. McTamaghan. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lave it there; lave it there, ye blithering numbskulls,\" he yelled, \"Unhitch those mules and get \u0027em out. The pork and wagon we can get when the water goes down. If another wagon goes over Oi\u0027ll rejuce it every mother\u0027s son of yez, and tie yez up by the thumbs besides.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si and Shorty waded around to unhitch the struggling mules, and then, taking poles in hand to steady themselves, took their stations in the stream where they could head the mules right. \\n\\n \\n\\n Thru the beating storm and the growing darkness, the wagons were, one by one, laboriously worked over until, as midnight approached, only three or four remained on the other side. Chilled to the bone, and almost dropping with fatigue from hours of standing in the deep water running like a mill race. Si called Al Klapp, Sib Ball and Jesse Langley to take their poles and act as guides. \\n\\n \\n\\n Al Klapp had it in for the sutlers. He was a worm that was ready to turn. He had seen some previous service, and had never gone to the Paymaster\u0027s table but to see the most of his $13 a month swept away by the sutler\u0027s remorseless hand. He and Jesse got the remaining army wagons over all right. The last wagon was a four-horse team belonging to a sutler. \\n\\n \\n\\n The fire of long-watched-for vengeance gleamed in Al\u0027s eye as he made out its character in the dim light. It reached the center of the stream, when over it went in the rushing current of muddy water. \\n\\n \\n\\n Al and Jesse busied themselves unhooking the struggling mules. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Colonel raged. \"Lave it there! Lave it there!\" he yelled after exhausting his plentiful stock of Irish expletives. \"But we must lave a guard with it. Capt. Sidney Hyde, your company has been doing less than any other. Detail a Sergeant and 10 men to stand guard here until tomorrow, and put them two thick-headed oudmahouns in the creek on guard with them. Make them stand double tricks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right. It was worth it,\" said Al Klapp, as the Sergeant put him on post, with the water running in rivulets from his clothes. \"It\u0027ll take a whole lot of skinning for the sutlers to get even for the dose I\u0027ve given one of them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"B\u0027yes, yoi\u0027ve done just splendid,\" said the Colonel, coming over to where Si and Shorty were sitting wringing the water and mud from their pantaloons and blouses. \"You\u0027re hayroes, both of yez. Take a wee drap from my canteen. It\u0027ll kape yez from catching cold.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, thankee, Kurnel,\" said Si, blushing with delight, and forgetting his fatigue and discomfort, in this condescension and praise from his commanding officer. \"I\u0027m a Good Templar.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sinsible b\u0027y,\" said the Colonel approvingly, and handing his canteen to Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m mightily afraid of catching cold,\" said Shorty, reaching eagerly for the canteen, and modestly turning his back on the Colonel that he might not see how deep his draft. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Should think you were,\" mused the Colonel, hefting the lightened vessel. \"Bugler, sound the assembly and let\u0027s get back to camp.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The next day the number of rusty muskets, dilapidated accouterments and quantity of soiled clothes in the camp of the 200th Ind. was only equaled by the number of unutterably weary and disgusted boys. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63209.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"简介： AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
