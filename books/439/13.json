{"id":45048,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XII. A WET NIGHT","content":"THE DEPRAVITY OF AN ARMY TENT REVEALS ITSELF. \\n\\n \\n\\n NIGHT threw her dark mantle over the camp of the 200th Ind. The details of guard and picket had been made. Videts, with sleepless eye and listening ear, kept watch and ward on the outposts, while faithful sentries trod their beats around the great bivouac. All day the army had marched, and was to take the road again at an early hour in the morning. Supper had been eaten, and the tired soldiers were gathered around the campfires that gleamed far and near through the darkness. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Si,\" said Shorty to his chum as they sat on a log beside the dying embers, \"how d\u0027ye like soldierin\u0027, as fur as ye\u0027ve got?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s purty hard business,\" said Si, reflectively, \"an\u0027 I s\u0027pose we haint seen the worst on it yet, either, from what I\u0027ve hearn tell. Pity the men that got up this war can\u0027t be made to do all the trampin\u0027 \u0027n\u0027 fitin\u0027. An\u0027 them fellers up in old Injjeanny that come \u0027round makin\u0027 such red-hot speeches to git us boys to \u0027list, wouldn\u0027t it be fun to see \u0027em humpin\u0027 \u0027long with gun \u0027n\u0027 knapsack, \u0027n\u0027 chawin\u0027 hardtack, \u0027n\u0027 stan\u0027in\u0027 guard nights, \u0027n\u0027 pourin\u0027 water on their blisters, \u0027n\u0027 pickin\u0027 graybacks off their shirts, \u0027n\u0027 p\u0027leecin\u0027 camp, \u0027n\u0027 washin\u0027 their own clothes?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think we\u0027d enj\u0027y seein\u0027 \u0027em do all that,\" said Shorty, laughing at the picture Si had drawn. \"I reckon most of \u0027em \u0027d peter out purty quick, and I\u0027d like to hear what sort o\u0027 speeches they\u0027d, make then. I tell ye, Si, there\u0027s a big diff\u0027rence \u0027tween goin\u0027 yerself an\u0027 tellin\u0027 some other feller to go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mebbe they\u0027ll git to draftin\u0027 after a while,\" observed Si, \"\u0027n\u0027 if they do I hope that\u0027ll ketch em!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wall, we\u0027re in fur it, anyway,\" said Shorty. \"Let\u0027s take down the bed \u0027n\u0027 turn in!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It didn\u0027t take long to complete the arrangements for the night. They spread their \"gum\" blankets, or ponchos, on the ground, within the tent, and on these their wool blankets, placed their knapsacks at the head for pillows, and that was all. It was warmer than usual that evening, and they stripped down to their nether garments. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Feels good once in a while,\" said Si, \"to peel a feller\u0027s clothes oft, \u0027n\u0027 sleep in a Christian-like way. But, Great Scott! Shorty, ain\u0027t this ground lumpy? It\u0027s like lying on a big washboard. I scooted all over the country huntin\u0027 fer straw to-night. There wasn\u0027t but one little stack within a mile of camp. Them derned Ohio chaps gobbled every smidgin of it. They didn\u0027t leave enuff to make a hummin\u0027-bird\u0027s nest. The 200th Ind. \u0027ll git even with \u0027em some day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So Si and Shorty crept in between the blankets, drew the top one up to their chins, and adjusted their bodily protuberances as best they could to fit the ridges and hollows beneath them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, Si,\" said Shorty, \"don\u0027t ye git to fitin\u0027 rebels in yer sleep and kick the kiver off, as ye did last night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As they lay there their ears caught the music of the bugles sounding the \"tattoo.\" Far and near floated through the clear night air the familiar melody that warned every soldier not on duty to go to bed. Next to the 200th Ind. lay a regiment of wild Michigan veterans, who struck up, following the strains of the bugles: \\n\\n \\n\\n Say, oh Dutch\u0027y, will ye fight mit Si-gel? \\n\\n Zwei glass o\u0027 la-ger, Yaw! Yaw! Yaw!!! \\n\\n Will yet fight to help de bul-ly ea-gle? \\n\\n \\n\\n Schweitzer-ksse und pret-zels, \\n\\n Hur-raw! raw! raw! \\n\\n \\n\\n During the night there came one of those sudden storms that seemed to be sent by an inscrutable Providence especially to give variety to the soldier\u0027s life. \\n\\n \\n\\n Struck by a Cyclone 111 \\n\\n \\n\\n A well-developed cyclone struck the camp, and Si and Shorty were soon awakened by the racket. The wind was blowing and whirling in fierce gusts, wrenching out the tent-pins or snapping the ropes as if they were threads. Everywhere was heard the flapping of canvas, and the yells and shouts of the men as they dashed about in the darkness and wild confusion. Many of the tents were already prostrate, and their demoralized inmates were crawling out from under the ruin. To crown all the rain began to fall in torrents. The camp was a vast pandemonium. The blackest darkness prevailed, save when the scene was illuminated by flashes of lightning. These were followed by peals of thunder that made the stoutest quake. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si sprang up at the first alarm. \"Git up, here, you fellers!\" he shouted. \"We\u0027d better go outside and grab the ropes, or the hull shebang \u0027ll go over.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was not a moment to spare. Si dashed out into the storm and darkness, followed by his comrades. Seizing the ropes, some of which were already loosened, they braced themselves and hung on for dear life, in the drenching rain, their hair and garments streaming in the wind. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si\u0027s prompt action saved the tent from the general wreck. The fury of the storm was soon past. Si and his comrades, after driving the pins and securing the ropes, re-entered the tent, wet and shivering for the mercury had gone down with a tumble, or rather it would have done so had they been supplied with thermometers. But the scanty costume in which Si found himself afforded a weather indicator sufficiently accurate for all practical purposes. \\n\\n \\n\\n Supper Under Difficulties 115 \\n\\n \\n\\n The ground was flooded, and their blankets and garments were fast absorbing the water that flowed around in such an exasperating way. Sleep under such conditions was out of the question. Si and Shorty put on their clothes and tried to make the best of their sorry plight. \\n\\n \\n\\n By this time the rain had nearly ceased. Fortunately they had laid in a good stock of fuel the night before, and after a little patient effort they succeeded in getting a fire started. Around this the boys hovered, alternately warming their calves and shins. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is a leetle more\u0027n I bargained fer,\" said Si. Then, taking a philosophical view of the case, he added, \"but there\u0027s one good thing about it, Shorty, we\u0027ll be all fixed for mornin\u0027, an\u0027 we won\u0027t have to get up when they sound the revel-lee. The buglers kin jest bust theirselves a-blowin\u0027 fer all I keer!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In this way the soldiers spent the remainder of the night. Before daybreak the blast of a hundred bugles rang out, but there was little need for the reveille. \\n\\n \\n\\n Breakfast was soon over, and in the gray dawn of that murky morning the long column went trailing on its way. The weather gave promise of a sloppy day, and the indications were fully verified. A drizzling rain set in, and continued without cessation. The boys put their heads through the holes in their ponchos, from the corners of which the water streamed. With their muskets at a \"secure\" they sloshed along through the mud, hour after hour. In spite of their \"gums\" the water found its way in at the back of the neck and trickled down their bodies. Their clothes became saturated, and they were altogether about as miserable as it is possible for mortals to be. \\n\\n \\n\\n A Field Shanty 117 \\n\\n \\n\\n It seemed to Si that the maximum of discomfort had been reached. He had experienced one thing after another during the few weeks since he left home, and he thought each in turn was worse than the last, and about as bad as it could be. But Si learned a good deal more before he graduated. All through the long, dreary day the soldiers plodded on. There was little comfort to be derived from the \"rest,\" for the ground was soaked with water. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t we think of it, Shorty,\" said Si, \"\u0027n\u0027 make it part o\u0027 the bargain\u0027 when we \u0027listed that we were to have umbrellers. These gum things don\u0027t amount to shucks, nohow, to keep the rain off. I sh\u0027d think Uncle Sam might do that much for us!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I reckon our clothes \u0027ll be purty well washed by the time we git out o\u0027 this mess,\" said Shorty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Feels that way,\" said Si; \"but how about the bilin\u0027? A cold bath jest refreshes them pesky little varmints, \u0027n\u0027 makes \u0027em livelier \u0027n ever. Say, Shorty, ye didn\u0027t write home anything \u0027bout our havin\u0027 graybacks, did ye?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, not yet; but I was thinkin\u0027 I\u0027d tell \u0027em \u0027bout it one o\u0027 these days.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Shorty, I ain\u0027t going to tell my folks; it \u0027d jest make my mother feel awful to know I was that way. And sister Maria, andâ€”\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Si was thinking aloud, and was going to say \"Annabel,\" but he checked himself. That name was not to be mentioned in other ears. But he was afraid she would go back on him if she knew, all about it. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was nearly night when the 200th Ind., dripping and discouraged, filed off into a field of standing corn to pass the night. The men sank to their shoetops in the soft earth. Si remarked to Shorty that he didn\u0027t see why the officers should turn \u0027em loose in such a place as that. But the longer he lived the more he found out about those things. That was the way they always did. \\n\\n \\n\\n It\u0027s the Morning 119 \\n\\n \\n\\n In five minutes after arms were stacked not a cornstalk remained standing in the field. During the afterfnoon the troops had gone over a long stretch of swamp road that was almost impassable for teams. Fears were entertained that the wagons of the regiment would not be up that night, and they would not have their tents to shelter them from the storm. In anticipation of such a calamity the boys, gathered in the cornstalks, having a vague idea that they would help out in case of emergency. \\n\\n \\n\\n Taking the Top Rail 113 \\n\\n \\n\\n Then there was a scramble for the fences. Recognizing the need of good fuel, an order from the General was filtered through the various headquarters that the men might take the top rails, only, from the fence inclosing tha field. This order was literally interpreted and carried out, each man, successively, taking the \"top rail\" as he found it. The very speedy result was that the bottom rails became the \"top,\" and then there weren\u0027t any. Almost in the twinkling of an eye the entire fence disappeared. \\n\\n \\n\\n The drizzle continued through the evening, and by the sputtering fires the soldiers prepared and ate their frugal suppers. Word came that, as was feared, the wagons were hopelessly bemired three or four miles back, and the men would have to make such shift as they could. \\n\\n \\n\\n The prospect was dreary and cheerless enough. It was little wonder that many of the young Hoosiers felt as if they wanted to quit and go home. But with that wonderful facility for adapting themselves to circumstances that marked the volunteer soldiers, they set about the work of preparing for the night. No one who has not \"been there\" can imagine how good a degree of comfortâ€”comparatively speaking, of courseâ€”it was possible to reach, with such surroundings, by the exercise of a little patience, ingenuity and industry. \\n\\n \\n\\n Si and Shorty and the others of the \"mess\" bestirred themselves, and it did not take them more than 20 minutes to build, out of rails and cornstalks, a shelter that was really inviting. They kindled a big fire in front of it, laid some rails within, covered with stalks, and on these spread their blankets. Si, who had \"bossed\" the job, viewed the work with great satisfaction. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I tell ye, that\u0027s no slouch of a shanty!\" said he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247/63200.html","bookId":439,"book":{"id":439,"title":"Si Klegg, Complete, Books 1-6","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š AFTER Si Klegg had finally yielded to his cumulative patriotic impulses and enlisted in the 200th Ind. for three years or until the rebellion was put down, with greater earnestness and solemnity to equip himself for his new career....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:46 AM"}}
