{"id":89571,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"She suddenly stopped. Theo hadn’t told her the name of the woman who had dropped the bread off, and Michelle couldn’t remember to whom Daddy had assigned the task. Quickly improvising, she continued, “. . . a friend’s house and baked a couple of loaves of bread.” “Don’t forget the grocery store.” “What? Oh, yes, I stopped by the grocery store.” Theo straddled the chair across from her. Stacking his arms on the back, he said, “So that’s your story, huh?” She began to smile. “Unless or until you find a couple of ‘Welcome to Bowen’ cards. In that event, my story will change.” “Tell Jake I said thanks.” “Thanks for what?” she asked innocently. “Hey, Mike, you want some gumbo?” Noah asked as he searched through the drawers looking for a ladle. “For breakfast? I’ll stick with an energy bar.” “What about you, Theo?” “Sure,” he said. “You know what goes great with gumbo? Potato chips.” “Sorry, I don’t have any potato chips. They aren’t good for you, anyway. Too much sodium.” “It will balance out with the sodium in the gumbo,” Noah told her. “You do too have potato chips. Two jumbo-size bags, and they’re the real thing. None of that low-fat cardboard stuff. Did you forget you bought them at the grocery store last night?” “I must have.” “You know what goes great with gumbo and chips?” Noah asked. “What’s that?” Theo asked. “Cold beer.” “I’m on it.” Theo got up and went to the refrigerator. Michelle shook her head. “Gumbo, potato chips, and beer at ten-thirty in the morning?” “It’s eleven, and we’ve been up for hours. Don’t frown like that, honey. Let us corrupt you. Join in.” “Is she a health nut?” Noah asked. “I think so,” Theo replied. “She lives by the credo ‘If it tastes good, spit it out.’” “When you boys are having your multiple bypasses, remember this conversation.” “I talked to Dr. Robinson,” Noah said then. He had found the ladle and was scooping the gumbo into two bowls. Theo already had the sack of chips and was opening it. “And?” she prodded. He put the bowls on the table, grabbed two tablespoons, and sat down. “He could only think of two men who gave him real trouble, and I’m running a check on both of them. An old guy named George Everett was one difficult patient. Do you know him, Mike?” “No, I don’t.” “Everett refused to pay his bill because Robinson didn’t cure him of his indigestion. Everett had a drinking problem, which he also blamed on the doctor. He told Robinson he wouldn’t be drinking himself drunk every night if he weren’t in such terrible pain. Anyway, Robinson turned the account over to a collection agency, and that didn’t sit well with Everett. He got all juiced up and called the doctor and threatened him.” “What about the other man?” Theo asked. “The name he gave Robinson was ‘John Thompson,’ but I doubt that’s his real name. He only saw the doctor once, and that was just a day or two before Robinson closed shop and sent his files to Mike. Thompson’s a druggie from New Orleans. He drove all the way to Bowen in hopes that the physicians here would be more lax, I suppose. Anyway, he told Robinson he had this terrible back pain and needed some prescriptions for pain medication. He wanted the heavy stuff and knew just what to ask for. When Robinson refused, he told me the junkie became enraged and threatened him.” “Did he report Thompson to the police?” Noah took a swig of beer before answering. “He should have, but he didn’t because he was leaving Bowen, and he didn’t want the hassle. That’s what he told me, anyway.” “I’ll bet Thompson tried other physicians in St. Claire,” Michelle said. “That’s what I figured too,” Noah said. “So I checked it out.” He grinned then as he made the comment, “I really love getting doctors out of bed early in the morning. Anyway, if Thompson did go to other doctors, he used a different name. No one remembers treating him.” “In other words, a dead end.” “I think it’s time for both of you to close this file,” Michelle said. “And stop worrying. I’m going to clean up my clinic, put stronger locks on the doors and windows, and move on. I suggest you do the same thing.” Since neither Theo nor Noah argued with her, she assumed they were too stubborn to admit she was right. “It’s gonna rain.” Theo made the prediction and then took a bite of gumbo. “The sun’s out,” Noah remarked. “Yeah, but my knee aches, so it’s gonna rain. My shoulder’s throbbing too.” Noah laughed. “You two are perfect for each other. A hypochondriac hooking up with a doctor. That’s a match made in heaven.” “I’m not a doctor,” Theo said dryly. Noah ignored the smart-ass comment. “Mike, have you ever been to Boston?” “No, I haven’t.” “You’ll like it.” She thought about what he was saying for a couple of seconds, then responded, “I’m sure, if I ever get there for a medical conference or a vacation, I’ll love it.” Noah glanced back and forth between Theo and Michelle. She’d sounded defensive, but he could see the sadness in her eyes. She was giving up before she’d even gotten started, he decided. Theo’s response was just as interesting. His whole body had tensed. “So, it’s two ships passing in the night?” “Something like that,” Michelle said. “Leave it alone, Noah.” He nodded, then switched topics. “So tell me, do we still fish Saturday if it rains?” “Fishing’s better in the rain,” Michelle said. “Says who?” Noah asked. “John Paul.” “Am I ever going to meet your brother?” Theo asked. “I doubt it. You’re leaving Monday, remember?” It was like a sore tooth she kept rubbing. He hadn’t pulled the rug out from under her. She’d known he was going to leave. So why was she feeling so devastated? “You’ll meet her brother at The Swan Friday,” Noah said. “Jake told me John Paul works as a bartender and a bouncer on weekends.” Michelle shook her head. “Daddy knows John Paul won’t show up this weekend. By now, my brother knows who you both work for, so he’ll stay away.” “Your brother wouldn’t happen to be a wanted man, would he?” Noah asked. “No, of course not.” “What’s he got against the FBI?” Theo asked. “You’ll have to ask him that question.” “Which kind of hinges on the fact that I’ll have to meet him so I can ask him the question,” Theo said. “My brother is a very private person,” she said defensively. “If and when he decides he’d like to meet you, then he’ll find you.” She smiled as she added, “You won’t see him coming. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got work to do.” She got up from the table, tossed her empty can in the trash, and then began to gather up the dirty dishes. Theo got up to help. He was filling the sink when the doorbell rang. Noah went to answer it. Michelle put the bowls in the sink, then turned back to the table. Theo caught her around the waist and leaned down to nuzzle her neck. “What’s going on with you?’’ She wasn’t sophisticated enough to play games or come up with a clever lie, and so she simply told him the truth. “You’re complicating my life.” He turned her around to face him. She backed away, but he followed her and pinned her against the sink. “You don’t regret —” “No,” she whispered. “It was wonderful.” She couldn’t quite look him in the eyes and focused on his chin instead so she could concentrate on what she wanted to say to him. “We’re both normal adults with healthy urges, and of course it’s . . .” “Healthy and normal?” “Don’t tease me. These urges . . .” “Yeah, I remember the urges,” he said. “We just can’t keep on giving in to these . . .” “Urges?” he offered when she suddenly stopped. She found herself smiling in spite of her frustration. “You’re making fun of me.” “Yeah, I am.” She pushed him back. “I’m not going to let you break my heart, Theo. Play your games with the big-city girls back home.” He laughed right in her face. “Big-city girls?” “Will you be serious. I’m trying to tell you that we don’t have a future together, so you should just leave me alone.” He cupped the sides of her face and kissed her passionately, and when he lifted his head, he saw the tears in her eyes. “Are you going to cry on me?” “No.” The answer was emphatic. “Good, ’cause I could have sworn I saw tears just now.” “I had no idea you could be so mean. I’m trying to tell you to stop . . .” He slowly shook his head. Her eyes widened. “No? Why not?” His mouth brushed over hers again in a quick, no-nonsense kiss. “You’re a smart girl. You figure it out.” Noah interrupted when he strolled back into the kitchen. He had a large FedEx box tucked under his arm and was carrying a huge metal pan covered with foil. “Theo, grab the box, will you? I found it propped against the door when I opened it. There was this lady standing there with this Cajun fried chicken. She handed it to me and took off before I could thank her. She was a nervous little thing.” “Did she tell you her name?” “Molly Beaumont,” he answered. He set the pan on the table and began to unwrap the foil. “Smells good.” “Was there a card for Theo with the chicken?” “No, she said you made the chicken, but the pan’s hers and she wants it back.” Theo was sitting at the table opening the box. Noah picked up a chicken leg and took a huge bite. Then he nudged Theo. “You know what else Molly said?” “What’s that?” “She asked me to tell Coach Buchanan, ‘Hey.’ Did you hear that, Theo? She called you Coach.” “Yeah, I know. Everyone in Bowen calls me Coach.” “Okay, so now I’ve got to wonder why,” he said. Theo wasn’t paying any attention to him. He finally got the box open and let out a low whistle. “Nick came through,” he said. “Playbooks.” He picked one up and thumbed through it. “Football playbooks?” Noah asked with his mouth full. “Yeah, I’ll explain later. Michelle, you can ride to the clinic with Noah. He’s spending the day with you.” “He doesn’t need to waste his time —” Theo cut her off. “He’s going with you.” Noah nodded. “While you and your friends are organizing the files, I’ll start the cleanup in your office. If there’s time, I’ll paint the walls.” “I’d be happy for your help, but —” “Don’t argue,” Theo said. “Okay,” she agreed. “I appreciate it, Noah.” Then she turned to Theo and asked him what he was going to be doing. “I’ve got a meeting with the Carsons and their attorney at one,” Theo said. “I’ll have to finish it by two-thirty because I promised Conrad I’d show up for practice at three. If you and Noah need a break, drop by.” “The principal offered Theo a contract,” Michelle said, smiling now. “He hasn’t signed it yet.” “You’re making that up,” Noah said. “I think Theo’s holding out for more money.” Noah was convinced the two of them were pulling his leg and was waiting to hear the punch line. “Okay,” he said. “We’ll stop by. What time is practice over? I’ve promised I’d help tend bar tonight. I should be there by five.” “I thought you were going to hook up with Mary Ann tonight,” Theo reminded. “What do you mean, you’re hooking up with Mary Ann?” Michelle asked. Noah shrugged. “She asked me if I wanted to get together later after her friend’s husband picked her up, and I suggested that she stop by The Swan, and if I’m not busy —” “She asked you to go out?” she asked, clearly surprised. “Yes, she did. Why is that so difficult to understand? I’m a nice guy.” “It isn’t difficult to understand. It’s just that she’s . . . and you’re . . . that is, you’re very . . . ” Noah was enjoying her discomfort. “I’m very what?” The word “experienced” came to mind along with about a dozen others. Noah was the kind of man who had women like Mary Ann for breakfast. Michelle realized she was being judgmental and that she could be wrong. “You’re . . .” “Yes?” Noah prodded. “Your friend has the hots for Noah,” Theo explained. Noah nodded. “Yeah, she does.” “Oh, for heaven’s sake,” she said, clearly exasperated. “Just because Mary Ann was being friendly, you immediately jump to the conclusion that she had the hots for Noah?” Theo smiled. “I didn’t jump to any conclusions. Honest. Mary Ann said, and I’m quoting here, ‘Hey, Theo, I’ve got the hots for Noah. So is he married or what?’” Noah nodded again. “That’s about how it happened.” The sad thing was that Michelle thought Theo might be telling the truth. Mary Ann did have the annoying habit of blurting out her every thought. Michelle started laughing even as she shook her head. “We’ve got to get to the clinic,” she told them. “Just a second, Michelle,” Noah said as he flipped through the playbook. “Theo, look at page fifty-three. Do you remember —” “Theodore, take that book away from your friend and get him moving now.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mercy-buchanan-renard-2/page-33.html","bookId":1834,"book":{"id":1834,"title":"Mercy (Buchanan-Renard #2)","description":"Storyline: #1 New York Times bestselling author Julie Garwood takes readers from New Orleans\u0027 exclusive Garden District to the backwoods of Louisiana\u0027s mysterious bayou country in an unforgettable novel of passion and suspense that cuts straight to the heart.
