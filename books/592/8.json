{"id":30920,"no":8,"title":"TOM WILDCAT INVITES DOCTOR RABBIT TO DINNER","content":"While Doctor Rabbit and busy Blue Jay were talking, Doctor Rabbit said suddenly, “Sh! keep still; there he is now!” And sure enough, there was Tom Wildcat just a little way off near a stump, where he had pounced upon an unfortunate mouse that happened to be passing that way, and gobbled him up. \n \n Tom Wildcat did not know there was anyone around, so he smacked his lips and smiled very broadly. It was only a small breakfast—in fact, just about enough for dessert for greedy Tom, but he never was particular; he would just as soon eat his dessert first as not. Indeed, I think he’d a little rather. \n \n And now Tom came slipping along and[Pg 35] looking for some signs of Doctor Rabbit. Then he happened to glance up and saw Doctor Rabbit looking from the upstairs window. \n \n “Why, good morning, Doctor Rabbit!” he said in his most pleasing, company voice, just as if nothing had happened. \n \n “Good morning to you, Tom.” Doctor Rabbit said it as pleasantly as if he and Tom were the best of friends. \n \n “It’s a fine morning,” wily Tom said, looking up and smiling; but all the while he was chuckling inwardly. \n \n “It’s a beautiful morning, just splendid. And I never saw you looking so fine,” Doctor Rabbit said. \n \n Well, sir, Tom Wildcat was actually deceived when Doctor Rabbit told him he looked so fine. He is such a vain fellow he believes anybody who tells him he is good-looking. That’s one[Pg 36] thing Tom Wildcat will always believe, because he wants to believe it. \n \n But he was not one bit deceived about anything else, for he remembered his recent experience in the hole. \n \n Because old Tom is always trying to deceive others, naturally he sometimes deceives himself. He thought that by acting kind and polite to Doctor Rabbit he might fool him, and so get him for dinner. And it made his mouth water to look at Doctor Rabbit and think what a fine dinner he would make. \n \n So he said gaily, “Well, we’ve had quite a good deal of fun lately; and ha, ha, ha! I’ve enjoyed it as much as anyone. In fact, I really like jokes, and I like you now better than ever, Doctor Rabbit. You’re the smartest and most sociable person in the woods. Do come over to my house and take dinner with[Pg 37] me. I’m going to have the loveliest green peas, and beans, and lettuce, and ever so many more of the sweetest vegetables you ever tasted!” \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2289/64179.html","bookId":592,"book":{"id":592,"title":"Doctor Rabbit and Tom Wildcat","description":"简介： Rap! rap! rap!
