Now, however, back in the basement police headquarters, Nunez could see the storm clouds gathering fast.\\n\\n Chief Trent Anderson was holding an ice pack to his head while another officer was tending to Sato\u0027s bruises. Both of them were standing with the video surveillance team, reviewing digital playback files in an attempt to locate Langdon and Bellamy.\\n\\n \"Check the playback on every hallway and exit,\" Sato demanded. \"I want to know where they went!\"\\n\\n Nunez felt ill as he looked on. He knew it would be only a matter of minutes before they found the right video clip and learned the truth. I helped them escape. Making matters worse was the arrival of a four-man CIA field team that was now staging nearby, prepping to go after Langdon and Bellamy. These guys looked nothing like the Capitol Police. These guys were dead-serious soldiers . . . black camouflage, night vision, futuristic-looking handguns.\\n\\n Nunez felt like he would throw up. Making up his mind, he motioned discreetly to Chief Anderson. \"A word, Chief?\"\\n\\n \"What is it?\" Anderson followed Nunez into the hall.\\n\\n \"Chief, I made a bad mistake,\" Nunez said, breaking a sweat. \"I\u0027m sorry, and I\u0027m resigning.\" You\u0027ll fire me in a few minutes anyway.\\n\\n \"I beg your pardon?\"\\n\\n Nunez swallowed hard. \"Earlier, I saw Langdon and Architect Bellamy in the visitor center on their way out of the building.\"\\n\\n \"What?!\" Anderson bellowed. \"Why didn\u0027t you say something?!\"\\n\\n \"The Architect told me not to say a word.\" \"You work for me, goddamm it!\" Anderson\u0027s voice echoed down the corridor. \"Bellamy smashed my head into a wall, for Christ\u0027s sake!\"\\n\\n Nunez handed Anderson the key that the Architect had given him.\\n\\n \"What is this?\" Anderson demanded.\\n\\n \"A key to the new tunnel under Independence Avenue. Architect Bellamy had it. That\u0027s how they escaped.\"\\n\\n Anderson stared down at the key, speechless.\\n\\n Sato poked her head out into the hallway, eyes probing. \"What\u0027s going on out here?\"\\n\\n Nunez felt himself go pale. Anderson was still holding the key, and Sato clearly had seen it. As the hideous little woman drew near, Nunez improvised as best as he could, hoping to protect his chief. \"I found a key on the floor in the subbasement. I was just asking Chief Anderson if he knew what it might go to.\"\\n\\n Sato arrived, eyeing the key. \"And does the chief know?\"\\n\\n Nunez glanced up at Anderson, who was clearly weighing all his options before speaking. Finally, the chief shook his head. \"Not offhand. I\u0027d have to check the--\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t bother,\" Sato said. \"This key unlocks a tunnel off the visitor center.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" Anderson said. \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n \"We just found the surveillance clip. Officer Nunez here helped Langdon and Bellamy escape and then relocked that tunnel door behind them. Bellamy gave Nunez that key.\"\\n\\n Anderson turned to Nunez with a flare of anger. \"Is this true?!\"\\n\\n Nunez nodded vigorously, doing his best to play along. \"I\u0027m sorry, sir. The Architect told me not to tell a soul!\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t give a damn what the Architect told you!\" Anderson yelled. \"I expect--\"\\n\\n \"Shut up, Trent,\" Sato snapped. \"You\u0027re both lousy liars. Save it for your CIA inquisition.\" She snatched the Architect\u0027s tunnel key from Anderson. \"You\u0027re done here.\"\\n\\n CHAPTER 49\\n\\n Robert Langdon hung up his cell phone, feeling increasingly worried. Katherine\u0027s not answering her cell? Katherine had promised to call him as soon as she was safely out of the lab and on her way to meet him here, but she had never done so.\\n\\n Bellamy sat beside Langdon at the reading-room desk. He, too, had just made a call, his to an individual he claimed could offer them sanctuary--a safe place to hide. Unfortunately, this person was not answering either, and so Bellamy had left an urgent message, telling him to call Langdon\u0027s cell phone right away.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll keep trying,\" he said to Langdon, \"but for the moment, we\u0027re on our own. And we need to discuss a plan for this pyramid.\"\\n\\n The pyramid. For Langdon, the spectacular backdrop of the reading room had all but disappeared, his world constricting now to include only what was directly in front of him--a stone pyramid, a sealed package containing a capstone, and an elegant African American man who had materialized out of the darkness and rescued him from the certainty of a CIA interrogation.\\n\\n Langdon had expected a modicum of sanity from the Architect of the Capitol, but now it seemed Warren Bellamy was no more rational than the madman claiming Peter was in purgatory. Bellamy was insisting this stone pyramid was, in fact, the Masonic Pyramid of legend. An ancient map? That guides us to powerful wisdom?\\n\\n \"Mr. Bellamy,\" Langdon said politely, \"this idea that there exists some kind of ancient knowledge that can imbue men with great power . . . I simply can\u0027t take it seriously.\"\\n\\n Bellamy\u0027s eyes looked both disappointed and earnest, making Langdon\u0027s skepticism all the more awkward. \"Yes, Professor, I had imagined you might feel this way, but I suppose I should not be surprised. You are an outsider looking in. There exist certain Masonic realities that you will perceive as myth because you are not properly initiated and prepared to understand them.\"\\n\\n Now Langdon felt patronized. I wasn\u0027t a member of Odysseus\u0027s crew, but I\u0027m certain the Cyclops is a myth. \"Mr. Bellamy, even if the legend is true . . . this pyramid cannot possibly be the Masonic Pyramid.\"\\n\\n \"No?\" Bellamy ran a finger across the Masonic cipher on the stone. \"It looks to me like it fits the description perfectly. A stone pyramid with a shining metal capstone, which, according to Sato\u0027s X-ray, is exactly what Peter entrusted to you.\" Bellamy picked up the little cube-shaped package, weighing it in his hand.\\n\\n \"This stone pyramid is less than a foot tall,\" Langdon countered. \"Every version of the story I\u0027ve ever heard describes the Masonic Pyramid as enormous.\"\\n\\n Bellamy had clearly anticipated this point. \"As you know, the legend speaks of a pyramid rising so high that God Himself can reach out and touch it.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly.\"\\n\\n \"I can see your dilemma, Professor. However, both the Ancient Mysteries and Masonic philosophy celebrate the potentiality of God within each of us. Symbolically speaking, one could claim that anything within reach of an enlightened man . . . is within reach of God.\"\\n\\n Langdon felt unswayed by the wordplay.\\n\\n \"Even the Bible concurs,\" Bellamy said. \"If we accept, as Genesis tells us, that `God created man in his own image,\u0027 then we also must accept what this implies--that mankind was not created inferior to God. In Luke 17:20 we are told, `The kingdom of God is within you.\u0027 \"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, but I don\u0027t know any Christians who consider themselves God\u0027s equal.\"\\n\\n \"Of course not,\" Bellamy said, his tone hardening. \"Because most Christians want it both ways. They want to be able to proudly declare they are believers in the Bible and yet simply ignore those parts they find too difficult or too inconvenient to believe.\"\\n\\n Langdon made no response.\\n\\n \"Anyhow,\" Bellamy said, \"the Masonic Pyramid\u0027s age-old description as being tall enough to be touched by God . . . this has long led to misinterpretations about its size. Conveniently, it keeps academics like yourself insisting the pyramid is a legend, and nobody searches for it.\"\\n\\n Langdon looked down at the stone pyramid. \"I apologize that I\u0027m frustrating you,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve simply always thought of the Masonic Pyramid as a myth.\"\\n\\n \"Does it not seem perfectly fitting to you that a map created by stonemasons would be carved in stone? Throughout history, our most important guideposts have always been carved in stone-- including the tablets God gave Moses--Ten Commandments to guide our human conduct.\"\\n\\n \"I understand, and yet it is always referred to as the Legend of the Masonic Pyramid. Legend implies it is mythical.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, legend.\" Bellamy chuckled. \"I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re suffering from the same problem Moses had.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry?\"\\n\\n Bellamy looked almost amused as he turned in his seat, glancing up at the second-tier balcony, where sixteen bronze statues peered down at them. \"Do you see Moses?\"\\n\\n Langdon gazed up at the library\u0027s celebrated statue of Moses. \"Yes.\" \"He has horns.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m aware of that.\"\\n\\n \"But do you know why he has horns?\"\\n\\n Like most teachers, Langdon did not enjoy being lectured to. The Moses above them had horns for the same reason thousands of Christian images of Moses had horns--a mistranslation of the book of Exodus. The original Hebrew text described Moses as having \"karan \u0027ohr panav\"-- \"facial skin that glowed with rays of light\"--but when the Roman Catholic Church created the official Latin translation of the Bible, the translator bungled Moses\u0027s description, rendering it as \"cornuta esset facies sua,\" meaning \"his face was horned.\" From that moment on, artists and sculptors, fearing reprisals if they were not true to the Gospels, began depicting Moses with horns.\\n\\n \"It was a simple mistake,\" Langdon replied. \"A mistranslation by Saint Jerome around four hundred A.D.\" Bellamy looked impressed. \"Exactly. A mistranslation. And the result is . . . poor Moses is now misshapen for all history.\"\\n\\n \"Misshapen\" was a nice way to put it. Langdon, as a child, had been terrified when he saw Michelangelo\u0027s diabolical \"horned Moses\"--the centerpiece of Rome\u0027s Basilica of St. Peter in Chains.\\n\\n \"I mention the horned Moses,\" Bellamy now said, \"to illustrate how a single word, misunderstood, can rewrite history.\"\\n\\n You\u0027re preaching to the choir, Langdon thought, having learned the lesson firsthand in Paris a number of years back. SanGreal: Holy Grail. SangReal: Royal Blood.\\n\\n \"In the case of the Masonic Pyramid,\" Bellamy continued, \"people heard whispers about a `legend.\u0027 And the idea stuck. The Legend of the Masonic Pyramid sounded like a myth. But the word legend was referring to something else. It had been misconstrued. Much like the word talisman.\" He smiled. \"Language can be very adept at hiding the truth.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s true, but you\u0027re losing me here.\"\\n\\n \"Robert, the Masonic Pyramid is a map. And like every map, it has a legend--a key that tells you how to read it.\" Bellamy took the cube-shaped package and held it up. \"Don\u0027t you see? This capstone is the legend to the pyramid. It is the key that tells you how to read the most powerful artifact on earth . . . a map that unveils the hiding place of mankind\u0027s greatest treasure--the lost wisdom of the ages.\"\\n\\n Langdon fell silent.\\n\\n \"I humbly submit,\" Bellamy said, \"that your towering Masonic Pyramid is only this . . . a modest stone whose golden capstone reaches high enough to be touched by God. High enough that an enlightened man can reach down and touch it.\"\\n\\n Silence hung between the two men for several seconds.\\n\\n Langdon felt an unexpected pulse of excitement as he looked down at the pyramid, seeing it in a new light. His eyes moved again to the Masonic cipher. \"But this code . . . it seems so . . .\"\\n\\n \"Simple?\"\\n\\n Langdon nodded. \"Almost anyone could decipher this.\"\\n\\n Bellamy smiled and retrieved a pencil and paper for Langdon. \"Then perhaps you should enlighten us?\"\\n\\n Langdon felt uneasy about reading the code, and yet considering the circumstances, it seemed a minor betrayal of Peter\u0027s trust. Moreover, whatever the engraving said, he could not imagine that it unveiled a secret hiding place of anything at all . . . much less that of one of history\u0027s greatest treasures.\\n\\n Langdon accepted the pencil from Bellamy and tapped it on his chin as he studied the cipher. The code was so simple that he barely needed pencil and paper. Even so, he wanted to ensure he made no mistakes, and so he dutifully put pencil to paper and wrote down the most common decryption key for a Masonic cipher. The key consisted of four grids--two plain and two dotted--with the alphabet running through them in order. Each letter of the alphabet was now positioned inside a uniquely shaped \"enclosure\" or \"pen.\" The shape of each letter\u0027s enclosure became the symbol for that letter.\\n\\n The scheme was so simple, it was almost infantile. Langdon double-checked his handiwork. Feeling confident the decryption key was correct, he now turned his attention back to the code inscribed on the pyramid. To decipher it, all he had to do was to find the matching shape on his decryption key and write down the letter inside it. The first character on the pyramid looked like a down arrow or a chalice. Langdon quickly found the chalice-shaped segment on the decryption key. It was located in the lower left-hand corner and enclosed the letter S.\\n\\n Langdon wrote down S.\\n\\n The next symbol on the pyramid was a dotted square missing its right side. That shape on the decryption grid enclosed the letter O.\\n\\n He wrote down O.\\n\\n The third symbol was a simple square, which enclosed the letter E.\\n\\n Langdon wrote down E.\\n\\n SOE...\\n\\n He continued, picking up speed until he had completed the entire grid.\\n\\n Now, as he gazed down at his finished translation, Langdon let out a puzzled sigh. Hardly what I\u0027d call a eureka moment.\\n\\n Bellamy\u0027s face showed the hint of a smile. \"As you know, Professor, the Ancient Mysteries are reserved only for the truly enlightened.\"\\n\\n \"Right,\" Langdon said, frowning. Apparently, I don\u0027t qualify.\\n\\n CHAPTER 50\\n\\n In a basement office deep inside CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the same sixteen- character Masonic cipher glowed brightly on a high-definition computer monitor. Senior OS analyst Nola Kaye sat alone and studied the image that had been e-mailed to her ten minutes ago by her boss, Director Inoue Sato.\\n\\n Is this some kind of joke? Nola knew it was not, of course; Director Sato had no sense of humor, and the events of tonight were anything but a joking matter. Nola\u0027s high-level clearance within the CIA\u0027s all-seeing Office of Security had opened her eyes to the shadow worlds of power. But what Nola had witnessed in the last twenty-four hours had changed her impressions forever of the secrets that powerful men kept.\\n\\n \"Yes, Director,\" Nola now said, cradling the phone on her shoulder as she talked to Sato. \"The engraving is indeed the Masonic cipher. However, the cleartext is meaningless. It appears to be a grid of random letters.\" She gazed down at her decryption.\\n\\n \"It must say something,\" Sato insisted.\\n\\n \"Not unless it has a second layer of encryption that I\u0027m not aware of.\"\\n\\n \"Any guesses?\" Sato asked.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a grid-based matrix, so I could run the usual--Vigenre, grilles, trellises, and so forth--but no promises, especially if it\u0027s a onetime pad.\"\\n\\n \"Do what you can. And do it fast. How about the X-ray?\"\\n\\n Nola swiveled her chair to a second system, which displayed a standard security X-ray of someone\u0027s bag. Sato had requested information on what appeared to be a small pyramid inside a cube-shaped box. Normally, a two-inch-tall object would not be an issue of national security unless it was made of enriched plutonium. This one was not. It was made of something almost equally startling.\\n\\n \"Image-density analysis was conclusive,\" Nola said. \"Nineteen-point-three grams per cubic centimeter. It\u0027s pure gold. Very, very valuable.\"\\n\\n \"Anything else?\"\\n\\n \"Actually, yes. The density scan picked up minor irregularities on the surface of the gold pyramid. It turns out the gold is engraved with text.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" Sato sounded hopeful. \"What does it say?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t tell yet. The inscription is extremely faint. I\u0027m trying to enhance with filters, but the resolution on the X-ray is not great.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, keep trying. Call me when you have something.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\\n\\n \"And, Nola?\" Sato\u0027s tone turned ominous. \"As with everything you have learned in the last twenty-four hours, the images of the stone pyramid and gold capstone are classified at the highest levels of security. You are to consult no one. You report to me directly. I want to make sure that is clear.\"\\n\\n \"Of course, ma\u0027am.\"\\n\\n \"Good. Keep me posted.\" Sato hung up.\\n\\n Nola rubbed her eyes and looked blearily back at her computer screens. She had not slept in over thirty-six hours, and she knew damn well she would not sleep again until this crisis had reached its conclusion.\\n\\n Whatever that may be.\\n\\n Back at the Capitol Visitor Center, four black-clad CIA field-op specialists stood at the entrance to the tunnel, peering hungrily down the dimly lit shaft like a pack of dogs eager for the hunt.\\n\\n Sato approached, having just hung up from a call. \"Gentlemen,\" she said, still holding the Architect\u0027s key, \"are your mission parameters clear?\"\\n\\n \"Affirmative,\" the lead agent replied. \"We have two targets. The first is an engraved stone pyramid, approximately one foot tall. The second is a smaller, cube-shaped package, approximately two inches tall. Both were last seen in Robert Langdon\u0027s shoulder bag.\"\\n\\n \"Correct,\" Sato said. \"These two items must be retrieved quickly and intact. Do you have any questions?\"\\n\\n \"Parameters for use of force?\"\\n\\n Sato\u0027s shoulder was still throbbing from where Bellamy had struck her with a bone. \"As I said, it is of critical importance that these items be retrieved.\"\\n\\n \"Understood.\" The four men turned and headed into the darkness of the tunnel. Sato lit a cigarette and watched them disappear.\\n\\n CHAPTER 51\\n\\n Katherine Solomon had always been a prudent driver, but now she was pushing her Volvo at over ninety as she fled blindly up the Suitland Parkway. Her trembling foot had been lodged on the accelerator for a full mile before her panic began to lift. She now realized her uncontrollable shivering was no longer solely from fear.\\n\\n I\u0027m freezing.\\n\\n The wintry night air was gushing through her shattered window, buffeting her body like an arctic wind. Her stockinged feet were numb, and she reached down for her spare pair of shoes, which she kept beneath the passenger seat. As she did, she felt a stab of pain from the bruise on her throat, where the powerful hand had latched on to her neck.\\n\\n The man who had smashed through her window bore no resemblance to the blond-haired gentleman whom Katherine knew as Dr. Christopher Abaddon. His thick hair and smooth, tanned complexion had disappeared. His shaved head, bare chest, and makeup-smeared face had been unveiled as a terrifying tapestry of tattoos.\\n\\n She heard his voice again, whispering to her in the howl of wind outside her broken window. Katherine, I should have killed you years ago . . . the night I killed your mother.\\n\\n Katherine shivered, feeling no doubt. That was him. She had never forgotten the look of fiendish violence in his eyes. Nor had she ever forgotten the sound of her brother\u0027s single gunshot, which had killed this man, propelling him off a high ledge into the frozen river below, where he plummeted through the ice and never resurfaced. Investigators had searched for weeks, never finding his body, and finally decided it had been washed away by the current out to the Chesapeake Bay.\\n\\n They were wrong, she now knew. He is still alive.\\n\\n And he\u0027s back.\\n\\n Katherine felt angst-ridden as the memories flooded back. It was almost exactly ten years ago. Christmas Day. Katherine, Peter, and their mother--her entire family--were gathered at their sprawling stone mansion in Potomac, nestled on a two-hundred-acre wooded estate with its own river running through it. As was tradition, their mother worked diligently in the kitchen, rejoicing in the holiday custom of cooking for her two children. Even at seventy-five years of age, Isabel Solomon was an exuberant cook, and tonight the mouthwatering smells of roast venison, parsnip gravy, and garlic mashed potatoes wafted through the house. While Mother prepared the feast, Katherine and her brother relaxed in the conservatory, discussing Katherine\u0027s latest fascination--a new field called Noetic Science. An unlikely fusion of modern particle physics and ancient mysticism, Noetics had absolutely captivated Katherine\u0027s imagination.\\n\\n Physics meets philosophy.\\n\\n Katherine told Peter about some of the experiments she was dreaming up, and she could see in his eyes that he was intrigued. Katherine felt particularly pleased to give her brother something positive to think about this Christmas, since the holiday had also become a painful reminder of a terrible tragedy.\\n\\n Peter\u0027s son, Zachary.\\n\\n Katherine\u0027s nephew\u0027s twenty-first birthday had been his last. The family had been through a nightmare, and it seemed that her brother was only now finally learning how to laugh again.\\n\\n Zachary had been a late bloomer, frail and awkward, a rebellious and angry teenager. Despite his deeply loving and privileged upbringing, the boy seemed determined to detach himself from the Solomon \"establishment.\" He was kicked out of prep school, partied hard with the \"celebrati,\" and shunned his parents\u0027 exhaustive attempts to provide him firm and loving guidance.\\n\\n He broke Peter\u0027s heart.\\n\\n Shortly before Zachary\u0027s eighteenth birthday, Katherine had sat down with her mother and brother and listened to them debating whether or not to withhold Zachary\u0027s inheritance until he was more mature. The Solomon inheritance--a centuries-old tradition in the family--bequeathed a staggeringly generous piece of the Solomon wealth to every Solomon child on his or her eighteenth birthday. The Solomons believed that an inheritance was more helpful at the beginning of someone\u0027s life than at the end. Moreover, placing large pieces of the Solomon fortune in the hands of eager young descendants had been the key to growing the family\u0027s dynastic wealth.\\n\\n In this case, however, Katherine\u0027s mother argued that it was dangerous to give Peter\u0027s troubled son such a large sum of money. Peter disagreed.\\n\\n \"The Solomon inheritance,\" her brother had said, \"is a family tradition that should not be broken. This money may well force Zachary to be more responsible.\"\\n\\n Sadly, her brother had been wrong.\\n\\n The moment Zachary received the money, he broke from the family, disappearing from the house without taking any of his belongings. He surfaced a few months later in the tabloids: TRUST FUND PLAYBOY LIVING EUROPEAN HIGH LIFE.\\n\\n The tabloids took joy in documenting Zachary\u0027s spoiled life of debauchery. The photos of wild parties on yachts and drunken disco stupors were hard for the Solomons to take, but the photos of their wayward teen turned from tragic to frightening when the papers reported Zachary had been caught carrying cocaine across a border in Eastern Europe: SOLOMON MILLIONAIRE IN TURKISH PRISON.\\n\\n The prison, they learned, was called Soganlik--a brutal F-class detention center located in the Kartal district outside of Istanbul. Peter Solomon, fearing for his son\u0027s safety, flew to Turkey to retrieve him. Katherine\u0027s distraught brother returned empty-handed, having been forbidden even to visit with Zachary. The only promising news was that Solomon\u0027s influential contacts at the U.S. State Department were working on getting him extradited as quickly as possible.\\n\\n Two days later, however, Peter received a horrifying international phone call. The next morning, headlines blared: SOLOMON HEIR MURDERED IN PRISON.\\n\\n The prison photos were horrific, and the media callously aired them all, even long after the Solomons\u0027 private burial ceremony. Peter\u0027s wife never forgave him for failing to free Zachary, and their marriage came to an end six months later. Peter had been alone ever since.\\n\\n It was years later that Katherine, Peter, and their mother, Isabel, were gathered quietly for Christmas. The pain was still a presence in their family, but mercifully it was fading with each passing year. The pleasant rattle of pots and pans now echoed from the kitchen as their mother prepared the traditional feast. Out in the conservatory, Peter and Katherine were enjoying a baked Brie and relaxed holiday conversation.\\n\\n Then came an utterly unexpected sound.\\n\\n \"Hello, Solomons,\" an airy voice said behind them.\\n\\n Startled, Katherine and her brother spun to see an enormous muscular figure stepping into the conservatory. He wore a black ski mask that covered all of his face except his eyes, which shone with feral ferocity.\\n\\n Peter was on his feet in an instant. \"Who are you?! How did you get in here?!\"\\n\\n \"I knew your little boy, Zachary, in prison. He told me where this key was hidden.\" The stranger held up an old key and grinned like a beast. \"Right before I bludgeoned him to death.\"\\n\\n Peter\u0027s mouth fell open.\\n\\n A pistol appeared, aimed directly at Peter\u0027s chest. \"Sit.\"\\n\\n Peter fell back into his chair. As the man moved into the room, Katherine was frozen in place. Behind his mask, the man\u0027s eyes were wild like those of a rabid animal.\\n\\n \"Hey!\" Peter yelled, as if trying to warn their mother in the kitchen. \"Whoever you are, take what you want, and get out!\"\\n\\n The man leveled his gun at Peter\u0027s chest. \"And what is it you think I want?\"\\n\\n \"Just tell me how much,\" Solomon said. \"We don\u0027t have money in the house, but I can--\"\\n\\n The monster laughed. \"Do not insult me. I have not come for money. I have come tonight for Zachary\u0027s other birthright.\" He grinned. \"He told me about the pyramid.\"\\n\\n Pyramid? Katherine thought in bewildered terror. What pyramid?\\n\\n Her brother was defiant. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t play dumb with me! Zachary told me what you keep in your study vault. I want it. Now.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever Zachary told you, he was confused,\" Peter said. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about!\"\\n\\n \"No?\" The intruder turned and aimed the gun at Katherine\u0027s face. \"How about now?\"\\n\\n Peter\u0027s eyes filled with terror. \"You must believe me! I don\u0027t know what it is you want!\"\\n\\n \"Lie to me one more time,\" he said, still aiming at Katherine, \"and I swear I will take her from you.\" He smiled. \"And from what Zachary said, your little sister is more precious to you than all your--\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on?!\" Katherine\u0027s mother shouted, marching into the room with Peter\u0027s Browning Citori shotgun--which she aimed directly at the man\u0027s chest. The intruder spun toward her, and the feisty seventy-five-year-old woman wasted no time. She fired a deafening blast of pellets. The intruder staggered backward, firing his handgun wildly in all directions, shattering windows as he fell and crashed through the glass doorway, dropping the pistol as he fell.\\n\\n Peter was instantly in motion, diving on the loose handgun. Katherine had fallen, and Mrs. Solomon hurried to her side, kneeling beside her. \"My God, are you hurt?!\"\\n\\n Katherine shook her head, mute with shock. Outside the shattered glass door, the masked man had clambered to his feet and was running into the woods, clutching his side as he ran. Peter Solomon glanced back to make sure his mother and sister were safe, and seeing they were fine, he held the pistol and raced out the door after the intruder.\\n\\n Katherine\u0027s mother held her hand, trembling. \"Thank heavens you\u0027re okay.\" Then suddenly her mother pulled away. \"Katherine? You\u0027re bleeding! There\u0027s blood! You\u0027re hurt!\" Katherine saw the blood. A lot of blood. It was all over her. But she felt no pain.\\n\\n Her mother frantically searched Katherine\u0027s body for a wound. \"Where does it hurt!\"\\n\\n \"Mom, I don\u0027t know, I don\u0027t feel anything!\"\\n\\n Then Katherine saw the source of the blood, and she went cold. \"Mom, it\u0027s not me . . .\" She pointed to the side of her mother\u0027s white satin blouse, where blood was running freely, and a small tattered hole was visible. Her mother glanced down, looking more confused than anything else. She winced and shrank back, as if the pain had just hit her.\\n\\n \"Katherine?\" Her voice was calm, but suddenly it carried the weight of her seventy-five years. \"I need you to call an ambulance.\"\\n\\n Katherine ran to the hall phone and called for help. When she got back to the conservatory, she found her mother lying motionless in a pool of blood. She ran to her, crouching down, cradling her mother\u0027s body in her arms.\\n\\n Katherine had no idea how much time had passed when she heard the distant gunshot in the woods. Finally, the conservatory door burst open, and her brother, Peter, rushed in, eyes wild, gun still in his hand. When he saw Katherine sobbing, holding their lifeless mother in her arms, his face contorted in anguish. The scream that echoed through the conservatory was a sound Katherine Solomon would never forget. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lost-symbol-robert-langdon-3/page-16.html","bookId":1515,"book":{"id":1515,"title":"The Lost Symbol (Robert Langdon #3)","description":"Storyline: In 1991, a document was locked in the safe of the director of the CIA.
