{"id":62411,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"CHAPTER 37 Mal\u0027akh had seen some eerie spaces in his life, but few rivaled the unearthly world of Pod 3. Wet Pod. The massive room looked as if a mad scientist had taken over a Walmart and packed every aisle and shelf with specimen jars of all shapes and sizes. Lit like a photographic darkroom, the space was bathed in a reddish haze of \"safelight\" that emanated from beneath the shelves, filtering upward and illuminating the ethanol-filled containers. The clinical smell of preservative chemicals was nauseating. \"This pod houses over twenty thousand species,\" the chubby girl was saying. \"Fish, rodents, mammals, reptiles.\" \"All dead, I hope?\" Mal\u0027akh asked, making a show of sounding nervous. The girl laughed. \"Yes, yes. All very much dead. I\u0027ll admit, I didn\u0027t dare come in for at least six months after I started work.\" Mal\u0027akh could understand why. Everywhere he looked there were specimen jars of dead life- forms--salamanders, jellyfish, rats, bugs, birds, and other things he could not begin to identify. As if this collection were not unsettling enough on its own, the hazy red safelights that protected these photosensitive specimens from long-term light exposure gave the visitor the feeling he was standing inside a giant aquarium, where lifeless creatures were somehow congregating to watch from the shadows. \"That\u0027s a coelacanth,\" the girl said, pointing to a big Plexiglas container that held the ugliest fish Mal\u0027akh had ever seen. \"They were thought to be extinct with the dinosaurs, but this was caught off Africa a few years back and donated to the Smithsonian.\" Lucky you, Mal\u0027akh thought, barely listening. He was busy scanning the walls for security cameras. He saw only one--trained on the entry door--not surprising, considering that entrance was probably the only way in. \"And here is what you wanted to see . . .\" she said, leading him to the giant tank he had seen from the window. \"Our longest specimen.\" She swept her arm out over the vile creature like a game-show host displaying a new car. \"Architeuthis.\" The squid tank looked like a series of glass phone booths had been laid on their sides and fused end to end. Within the long, clear Plexiglas coffin hovered a sickeningly pale and amorphous shape. Mal\u0027akh gazed down at the bulbous, saclike head and its basketball-size eyes. \"Almost makes your coelacanth look handsome,\" he said. \"Wait till you see her lit.\" Trish flipped back the long lid of the tank. Ethanol fumes wafted out as she reached down into the tank and flipped a switch just above the liquid line. A string of fluorescent lights flickered to life along the entire base of the tank. Architeuthis was now shining in all her glory--a colossal head attached to a slithery mass of decaying tentacles and razor-sharp suckers. She began talking about how Architeuthis could beat a sperm whale in a fight. Mal\u0027akh heard only empty prattling. The time had come. Trish Dunne always felt a bit uneasy in Pod 3, but the chill that had just run through her felt different. Visceral. Primal. She tried to ignore it, but it grew quickly now, clawing deeply at her. Although Trish could not seem to place the source of her anxiety, her gut was clearly telling her it was time to leave. \"Anyhow, that\u0027s the squid,\" she said, reaching into the tank and turning off the display light. \"We should probably get back to Katherine\u0027s--\" A broad palm clamped hard over her mouth, yanking her head back. Instantly, a powerful arm was wrapped around her torso, pinning her against a rock-hard chest. For a split second, Trish went numb with shock. Then came the terror. The man groped across her chest, grabbing her key card and yanking down hard. The cord burned the back of her neck before snapping. The key card fell on the floor at their feet. She fought, trying to twist away, but she was no match for the man\u0027s size and strength. She tried to scream, but his hand remained tightly across her mouth. He leaned down and placed his mouth next to her ear, whispering, \"When I take my hand off your mouth, you will not scream, is that clear?\" She nodded vigorously, her lungs burning for air. I can\u0027t breathe! The man removed his hand from her mouth, and Trish gasped, inhaling deeply. \"Let me go!\" she demanded, breathless. \"What the hell are you doing?\" \"Tell me your PIN number,\" the man said. Trish felt totally at a loss. Katherine! Help! Who is this man?! \"Security can see you!\" she said, knowing full well they were out of range of the cameras. And nobody is watching anyway. \"Your PIN number,\" the man repeated. \"The one that matches your key card.\" An icy fear churned in her gut, and Trish spun violently, wriggling an arm free and twisting around, clawing at the man\u0027s eyes. Her fingers hit flesh and raked down one cheek. Four dark gashes opened on his flesh where she scratched him. Then she realized the dark stripes on his flesh were not blood. The man was wearing makeup, which she had just scratched off, revealing dark tattoos hidden underneath. Who is this monster?! With seemingly superhuman strength, the man spun her around and hoisted her up, pushing her out over the open squid tank, her face now over the ethanol. The fumes burned her nostrils. \"What is your PIN number?\" he repeated. Her eyes burned, and she could see the pale flesh of the squid submerged beneath her face. \"Tell me,\" he said, pushing her face closer to the surface. \"What is it?\" Her throat was burning now. \"Zero-eight-zero-four!\" she blurted, barely able to breathe. \"Let me go! Zero-eight-zero-four!\" \"If you\u0027re lying,\" he said, pushing down farther, her hair in the ethanol now. \"I\u0027m not lying!\" she said, coughing. \"August 4! It\u0027s my birthday!\" \"Thank you, Trish.\" His powerful hands clasped her head tighter, and a crushing force rammed her downward, plunging her face into the tank. Searing pain burned her eyes. The man pressed down harder, driving her whole head under the ethanol. Trish felt her face pressing into the fleshy head of the squid. Summoning all of her strength, she bucked violently, arching backward, trying to pull her head out of the tank. But the powerful hands did not budge. I have to breathe! She remained submerged, straining not to open her eyes or mouth. Her lungs burned as she fought the powerful urge to breathe in. No! Don\u0027t! But Trish\u0027s inhalation reflex finally took over. Her mouth flew open, and her lungs expanded violently, attempting to suck in the oxygen that her body craved. In a searing rush, a wave of ethanol poured into her mouth. As the chemicals gushed down her throat into her lungs, Trish felt a pain like nothing she had ever imagined possible. Mercifully, it lasted only a few seconds before her world went black. Mal\u0027akh stood beside the tank, catching his breath and surveying the damage. The lifeless woman lay slumped over the rim of the tank, her face still submerged in ethanol. Seeing her there, Mal\u0027akh flashed on the only other woman he had ever killed. Isabel Solomon. Long ago. Another life. Mal\u0027akh gazed down now at the woman\u0027s flaccid corpse. He grabbed her ample hips and lifted with his legs, hoisting her up, pushing forward, until she began to slide over the rim of the squid tank. Trish Dunne slithered headfirst down into the ethanol. The rest of her body followed, sloshing down. Gradually, the ripples subsided, leaving the woman hovering limp over the huge sea creature. As her clothing got heavier, she began to sink, slipping into the darkness. Bit by bit, Trish Dunne\u0027s body settled on top of the great beast. Mal\u0027akh wiped his hands and replaced the Plexiglas lid, sealing the tank. Wet Pod has a new specimen. He retrieved Trish\u0027s key card from the floor and slipped it in his pocket: 0804. When Mal\u0027akh had first seen Trish in the lobby, he\u0027d seen a liability. Then he\u0027d realized her key card and password were his insurance. If Katherine\u0027s data-storage room was as secure as Peter had implied, then Mal\u0027akh was anticipating some challenges persuading Katherine to unlock it for him. I now have my own set of keys. He was pleased to know he would no longer have to waste time bending Katherine to his will. As Mal\u0027akh stood up straight, he saw his own reflection in the window and could tell his makeup was badly mangled. It didn\u0027t matter anymore. By the time Katherine put it all together, it would be too late. CHAPTER 38 \"This room is Masonic?\" Sato demanded, turning from the skull and staring at Langdon in the darkness. Langdon nodded calmly. \"It\u0027s called a Chamber of Reflection. These rooms are designed as cold, austere places in which a Mason can reflect on his own mortality. By meditating on the inevitability of death, a Mason gains a valuable perspective on the fleeting nature of life.\" Sato looked around the eerie space, apparently not convinced. \"This is some kind of meditation room?\" \"Essentially, yes. These chambers always incorporate the same symbols--skull and crossed bones, scythe, hourglass, sulfur, salt, blank paper, a candle, et cetera. The symbols of death inspire Masons to ponder how better to lead their lives while on this earth.\" \"It looks like a death shrine,\" Anderson said. That\u0027s kind of the point. \"Most of my symbology students have the same reaction at first.\" Langdon often assigned them Symbols of Freemasonry by Beresniak, which contained beautiful photos of Chambers of Reflection. \"And your students,\" Sato demanded, \"don\u0027t find it unnerving that Masons meditate with skulls and scythes?\" \"No more unnerving than Christians praying at the feet of a man nailed to a cross, or Hindus chanting in front of a four-armed elephant named Ganesh. Misunderstanding a culture\u0027s symbols is a common root of prejudice.\" Sato turned away, apparently in no mood for a lecture. She moved toward the table of artifacts. Anderson tried to light her way with the flashlight, but the beam was beginning to dim. He tapped the heel of the light and coaxed it to burn a little brighter. As the threesome moved deeper into the narrow space, the pungent tang of sulfur filled Langdon\u0027s nostrils. The subbasement was damp, and the humidity in the air was activating the sulfur in the bowl. Sato arrived at the table and stared down at the skull and accompanying objects. Anderson joined her, doing his best to light the desk with the weakening beam of his flashlight. Sato examined everything on the table and then placed her hands on her hips, sighing. \"What is all this junk?\" The artifacts in this room, Langdon knew, were carefully selected and arranged. \"Symbols of transformation,\" he told her, feeling confined as he inched forward and joined them at the table. \"The skull, or caput mortuum, represents man\u0027s final transformation through decay; it\u0027s a reminder that we all shed our mortal flesh one day. The sulfur and salt are alchemical catalysts that facilitate transformation. The hourglass represents the transformational power of time.\" He motioned to the unlit candle. \"And this candle represents the formative primordial fire and the awakening of man from his ignorant slumber--transformation through illumination.\" \"And . . . that?\" Sato asked, pointing into the corner. Anderson swung his dimming flashlight beam to the giant scythe that leaned against the back wall. \"Not a death symbol, as most assume,\" Langdon said. \"The scythe is actually a symbol of the transformative nourishment of nature--the reaping of nature\u0027s gifts.\" Sato and Anderson fell silent, apparently trying to process their bizarre surroundings. Langdon wanted nothing more than to get out of the place. \"I realize this room may seem unusual,\" he told them, \"but there\u0027s nothing to see here; it\u0027s really quite normal. A lot of Masonic lodges have chambers exactly like this one.\" \"But this is not a Masonic lodge!\"Anderson declared. \"It\u0027s the U.S. Capitol, and I\u0027d like to know what the hell this room is doing in my building.\" \"Sometimes Masons set aside rooms like this in their offices or private homes as meditation spaces. It is not uncommon.\" Langdon knew a heart surgeon in Boston who had converted a closet in his office into a Masonic Chamber of Reflection so he could ponder mortality before going into surgery. Sato looked troubled. \"You\u0027re saying Peter Solomon comes down here to reflect on death?\" \"I really don\u0027t know,\" Langdon said sincerely. \"Maybe he created it as a sanctuary for his Masonic brothers who work in the building, giving them a spiritual sanctuary away from the chaos of the material world . . . a place for a powerful lawmaker to reflect before making decisions that affect his fellow man.\" \"Lovely sentiment,\" Sato said, her tone sarcastic, \"but I have a feeling Americans might have a problem with their leaders praying in closets with scythes and skulls.\" Well, they shouldn\u0027t, Langdon thought, imagining how different a world it might be if more leaders took time to ponder the finality of death before racing off to war. Sato pursed her lips and carefully surveyed all four corners of the candle lit chamber. \"There must be something in here besides human bones and bowls of chemicals, Professor. Someone transported you all the way from your home in Cambridge to be in this precise room.\" Langdon clutched his daybag to his side, still unable to imagine how the package he carried might relate to this chamber. \"Ma\u0027am, I\u0027m sorry, but I don\u0027t see anything out of the ordinary here.\" Langdon hoped that now at last they could get to the business of trying to find Peter. Anderson\u0027s light flickered again, and Sato spun on him, her temper starting to show. \"For Christ\u0027s sake, is it too much to ask?\" She plunged her hand into her pocket and yanked out a cigarette lighter. Striking her thumb on the flint, she held out the flame and lit the desk\u0027s lone candle. The wick sputtered and then caught, spreading a ghostly luminescence throughout the constricted space. Long shadows raked the stone walls. As the flame grew brighter, an unexpected sight materialized before them. \"Look!\" Anderson said, pointing. In the candlelight, they could now see a faded patch of graffiti--seven capital letters scrawled across the rear wall. VITRIOL \"An odd choice of word,\" Sato said as the candlelight cast a frightening skull-shaped silhouette across the letters. \"Actually, it\u0027s an acronym,\" Langdon said. \"It\u0027s written on the rear wall of most chambers like this as a shorthand for the Masonic meditative mantra: Visita interiora terrae, rectificando invenies occultum lapidem.\" Sato eyed him, looking almost impressed. \"Meaning?\" \"Visit the interior of the earth, and by rectifying, you will find the hidden stone.\" Sato\u0027s gaze sharpened. \"Does the hidden stone have any connection to a hidden pyramid?\" Langdon shrugged, not wanting to encourage the comparison. \"Those who enjoy fantasizing about hidden pyramids in Washington would tell you that occultum lapidem refers to the stone pyramid, yes. Others will tell you it\u0027s a reference to the Philosopher\u0027s Stone--a substance alchemists believed could bring them everlasting life or turn lead into gold. Others claim it\u0027s a reference to the Holy of Holies, a hidden stone chamber at the core of the Great Temple. Some say it\u0027s a Christian reference to the hidden teachings of Saint Peter--the Rock. Every esoteric tradition interprets `the stone\u0027 in its own way, but invariably the occultum lapidem is a source of power and enlightenment.\" Anderson cleared his throat. \"Is it possible Solomon lied to this guy? Maybe he told him there was something down here . . . and there really isn\u0027t.\" Langdon was having similar thoughts. Without warning, the candle flame flickered, as if caught by a draft. It dimmed for a moment and then recovered, burning brightly again. \"That\u0027s odd,\" Anderson said. \"I hope no one closed the door upstairs.\" He strode out of the chamber into the darkness of the hallway. \"Hello?\" Langdon barely noticed him leave. His gaze had been drawn suddenly to the rear wall. What just happened? \"Did you see that?\" Sato asked, also staring with alarm at the wall. Langdon nodded, his pulse quickening. What did I just see? A moment earlier, the rear wall seemed to have shimmered, as if a ripple of energy had passed through it. Anderson now strode back into the room. \"No one\u0027s out there.\" As he entered, the wall shimmered again. \"Holy shit!\" he exclaimed, jumping back. All three stood mute for a long moment, staring in unison at the back wall. Langdon felt another chill run through him as he realized what they were seeing. He reached out tentatively, until his fingertips touched the rear surface of the chamber. \"It\u0027s not a wall,\" he said. Anderson and Sato stepped closer, peering intently. \"It\u0027s a canvas,\" Langdon said. \"But it billowed,\" Sato said quickly. Yes, in a very strange way. Langdon examined the surface more closely. The sheen on the canvas had refracted the candlelight in a startling manner because the canvas had just billowed away from the room . . . fluttering backward through the plane of the rear wall. Langdon extended his outstretched fingers very gently, pressing the canvas backward. Startled, he yanked his hand back. There\u0027s an opening! \"Pull it aside,\" Sato ordered. Langdon\u0027s heart pounded wildly now. He reached up and clutched the edge of the canvas banner, slowly pulling the fabric to one side. He stared in disbelief at what lay hidden behind it. My God. Sato and Anderson stood in stunned silence as they looked through the opening in the rear wall. Finally, Sato spoke. \"It appears we\u0027ve just found our pyramid.\" CHAPTER 39 Robert Langdon stared at the opening in the rear wall of the chamber. Hidden behind the canvas banner, a perfectly square hole had been hollowed out of the wall. The opening, about three feet across, appeared to have been created by removing a series of bricks. For a moment, in the darkness, Langdon thought the hole was a window to a room beyond. Now he saw it was not. The opening extended only a few feet into the wall before terminating. Like a rough-hewn cubbyhole, the recessed niche reminded Langdon of a museum alcove designed to hold a statuette. Fittingly, this niche displayed one small object. About nine inches tall, it was a piece of carved, solid granite. The surface was elegant and smooth with four polished sides that shone in the candlelight. Langdon could not fathom what it was doing here. A stone pyramid? \"From your look of surprise,\" Sato said, sounding self-satisfied, \"I take it this object is not typical within a Chamber of Reflection?\" Langdon shook his head. \"Then perhaps you would like to reassess your previous claims regarding the legend of a Masonic Pyramid hidden in Washington?\" Her tone now was almost smug. \"Director,\" Langdon replied instantly, \"this little pyramid is not the Masonic Pyramid.\" \"So it is merely coincidence that we found a pyramid hidden at the heart of the U.S. Capitol in a secret chamber belonging to a Masonic leader?\" Langdon rubbed his eyes and tried to think clearly. \"Ma\u0027am, this pyramid doesn\u0027t resemble the myth in any way. The Masonic Pyramid is described as enormous, with a tip forged of solid gold.\" Moreover, Langdon knew, this little pyramid--with its flat top--was not even a true pyramid. Without its tip, this was another symbol entirely. Known as an Unfinished Pyramid, it was a symbolic reminder that man\u0027s ascent to his full human potential was always a work in progress. Though few realized it, this symbol was the most widely published symbol on earth. Over twenty billion in print. Adorning every one-dollar bill in circulation, the Unfinished Pyramid waited patiently for its shining capstone, which hovered above it as a reminder of America\u0027s yet- unfulfilled destiny and the work yet to be done, both as a country and as individuals. \"Lift it down,\" Sato said to Anderson, motioning to the pyramid. \"I want a closer look.\" She began making room on the desk by shoving the skull and crossed bones to one side with no reverence whatsoever. Langdon was starting to feel like they were common grave robbers, desecrating a personal shrine. Anderson maneuvered past Langdon, reached into the niche, and clamped his large palms on either side of the pyramid. Then, barely able to lift at this awkward angle, he slid the pyramid toward him and lowered it with a hard thud onto the wooden desk. He stepped back to give Sato room. The director repositioned the candle close to the pyramid and studied its polished surface. Slowly, she ran her tiny fingers over it, examining every inch of the flat top, and then the sides. She wrapped her hands around to feel the back, then frowned in apparent disappointment. \"Professor, earlier you said the Masonic Pyramid was constructed to protect secret information.\" \"That\u0027s the legend, yes.\" \"So, hypothetically speaking, if Peter\u0027s captor believed this was the Masonic Pyramid, he would believe it contained powerful information.\" Langdon nodded, exasperated. \"Yes, although even if he found this information, he probably would not be able to read it. According to legend, the contents of the pyramid are encoded, making them indecipherable . . . except to the most worthy.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" Despite Langdon\u0027s growing impatience, he replied with an even tone. \"Mythological treasures are always protected by tests of worthiness. As you may recall, in the legend of the Sword in the Stone, the stone refuses to give up the sword except to Arthur, who was spiritually prepared to wield the sword\u0027s awesome power. The Masonic Pyramid is based on the same idea. In this case, the information is the treasure, and it is said to be written in an encoded language--a mystical tongue of lost words--legible only to the worthy.\" A faint smile crossed Sato\u0027s lips. \"That may explain why you were summoned here tonight.\" \"I\u0027m sorry?\" Calmly, Sato rotated the pyramid in place, turning it a full 180 degrees. The pyramid\u0027s fourth side now shone in the candlelight. Robert Langdon stared at it with surprise. \"It appears,\" Sato said, \"that someone believes you\u0027re worthy.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lost-symbol-robert-langdon-3/page-13.html","bookId":1515,"book":{"id":1515,"title":"The Lost Symbol (Robert Langdon #3)","description":"Storyline: In 1991, a document was locked in the safe of the director of the CIA.
