On the side of the golden capstone, an incandescent message was glowing.\n Langdon read the shining text, scarcely able to believe his eyes. He knew the pyramid was rumored to reveal a specific location . . . but he had never imagined that the location would be quite this specific.\n Eight Franklin Square\n \"A street address,\" he whispered, stunned.\n Katherine looked equally amazed. \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s there, do you?\"\n Langdon shook his head. He knew Franklin Square was one of the older sections of Washington, but he wasn\u0027t familiar with the address. He looked at the tip of the capstone, and read downward, taking in the entire text.\n The\n secret hides\n within The Order\n Eight Franklin Square\n Is there some kind of Order on Franklin Square?\n Is there a building that hides the opening to a deep spiral staircase?\n Whether or not there was actually something buried at that address, Langdon had no idea. The important issue at this point was that he and Katherine had deciphered the pyramid and now possessed the information required to negotiate Peter\u0027s release.\n And not a moment too soon.\n The glowing arms on Langdon\u0027s Mickey Mouse watch indicated that they had less than ten minutes to spare.\n \"Make the call,\" Katherine said, motioning to a phone on the wall in the kitchen. \"Now!\"\n The sudden arrival of this moment startled Langdon, and he found himself hesitating.\n \"Are we sure about this?\"\n \"I most certainly am.\"\n \"I\u0027m not telling him anything until we know Peter is safe.\"\n \"Of course not. You remember the number, right?\"\n Langdon nodded and made his way over to the kitchen phone. He lifted the receiver and dialed the man\u0027s cell-phone number. Katherine came over and placed her head next to his so she could listen in. As the line began to ring, Langdon prepared himself for the eerie whisper of the man who had tricked him earlier tonight.\n Finally, the call connected.\n There was no greeting, though. No voice. Only the sound of breathing at the other end.\n Langdon waited and then finally spoke. \"I have the information you want, but if you want it, you\u0027ll have to give us Peter.\"\n \"Who is this?\" a woman\u0027s voice replied.\n Langdon jumped. \"Robert Langdon,\" he said reflexively. \"Who are you?\" For an instant he thought he must have dialed incorrectly.\n \"Your name is Langdon?\" The woman sounded surprised. \"There\u0027s someone here asking for you.\"\n What? \"I\u0027m sorry, who is this?\"\n \"Officer Paige Montgomery with Preferred Security.\" Her voice seemed shaky. \"Maybe you can help us with this. About an hour ago, my partner responded to a 911 call in Kalorama Heights . . . a possible hostage situation. I lost all contact with her, and so I called backup and came to check the residence. We found my partner dead in the backyard. The home owner was gone, and so we broke in. A cell phone was ringing on the hall table, and I--\" \"You\u0027re inside?\" Langdon demanded.\n \"Yes, and the 911 tip . . . was a good one,\" the woman stammered. \"Sorry if I sound rattled, but my partner\u0027s dead, and we found a man being held here against his will. He\u0027s in bad shape, and we\u0027re working on him now. He\u0027s been asking for two people--one named Langdon and one named Katherine.\"\n \"That\u0027s my brother!\" Katherine blurted into the receiver, pressing her head closer to Langdon\u0027s. \"I made the 911 call! Is he okay?!\"\n \"Actually, ma\u0027am, he\u0027s . . .\" The woman\u0027s voice cracked. \"He\u0027s in bad shape. He\u0027s missing his right hand . . .\"\n \"Please,\" Katherine urged. \"I want to talk to him!\"\n \"They\u0027re working on him at the moment. He\u0027s in and out of consciousness. If you\u0027re anywhere in the area, you should get over here. He obviously wants to see you.\"\n \"We\u0027re about six minutes away!\" Katherine said.\n \"Then I suggest you hurry.\" There was a muffled noise in the background, and the woman then returned to the line. \"Sorry, it looks like I\u0027m needed. I\u0027ll speak to you when you arrive.\"\n The line went dead.\n CHAPTER 91\n Inside Cathedral College, Langdon and Katherine bounded up the basement stairs and hurried down a darkened hallway looking for a front exit. No longer did they hear the sounds of helicopter blades overhead, and Langdon felt hopeful they could slip out unseen and find their way up to Kalorama Heights to see Peter.\n They found him. He\u0027s alive.\n Thirty seconds earlier, when they\u0027d hung up with the female security guard, Katherine had hurriedly hoisted the steaming pyramid and capstone out of the water. The pyramid was still dripping when she lowered it into Langdon\u0027s leather bag. Now he could feel the heat radiating through the leather. Excitement over Peter\u0027s discovery had temporarily trumped any further reflection on the capstone\u0027s glowing message--Eight Franklin Square-- but there would be time for that once they got to Peter.\n As they rounded the corner at the top of the stairs, Katherine stopped short and pointed into a sitting room across the hall. Through the bay window, Langdon could see a sleek black helicopter sitting silent on the lawn. A lone pilot stood beside it, facing away from them and talking on his radio. There was also a black Escalade with tinted windows parked nearby.\n Staying in the shadows, Langdon and Katherine moved into the sitting room, and peered out the window to see if they could see the rest of the field team. Thankfully, the huge lawn outside the National Cathedral was empty.\n \"They must be inside the cathedral,\" Langdon said.\n \"They\u0027re not,\" a deep voice said behind them.\n Langdon and Katherine wheeled around to see who had spoken. In the doorway of the sitting room, two black-clad figures aimed laser-sighted rifles at them. Langdon could see a glowing red dot dancing on his chest.\n \"Nice to see you again, Professor,\" said a familiar raspy voice. The agents parted, and the tiny form of Director Sato sliced effortlessly through, crossing the sitting room and stopping directly in front of Langdon. \"You\u0027ve made some exceedingly poor choices tonight.\"\n \"The police found Peter Solomon,\" Langdon declared forcefully. \"He\u0027s in bad shape, but he\u0027ll live. It\u0027s over.\"\n If Sato was surprised Peter had been found, she did not show it. Her eyes were unflinching as she walked to Langdon and stopped only inches away. \"Professor, I can assure you, this is nowhere near over. And if the police are now involved, it has only become more serious. As I told you earlier this evening, this is an extremely delicate situation. You never should have run away with that pyramid.\"\n \"Ma\u0027am,\" Katherine blurted, \"I need to see my brother. You can have the pyramid, but you must let--\"\n \"I must?\" Sato demanded, spinning to Katherine. \"Ms. Solomon, I assume?\" She stared at Katherine with fire in her eyes and then turned back to Langdon. \"Put the leather bag on the table.\"\n Langdon glanced down at the pair of laser sights on his chest. He set the leather bag on the coffee table. An agent approached cautiously, unzipped the bag, and pulled the two sides apart. A little puff of trapped steam billowed up out of the bag. He aimed his light inside, stared for a long, puzzled moment, and then nodded to Sato. Sato walked over and peered into the bag. The wet pyramid and capstone glistened in the beam of the flashlight. Sato crouched down, looking very closely at the golden capstone, which Langdon realized she had only seen in X-ray.\n \"The inscription,\" Sato demanded. \"Does it mean anything to you? `The secret hides within The Order\u0027?\"\n \"We\u0027re not sure, ma\u0027am.\"\n \"Why is the pyramid steaming hot?\"\n \"We submerged it in boiling water,\" Katherine said without hesitation. \"It was part of the process of deciphering the code. We\u0027ll tell you everything, but please let us go see my brother. He\u0027s been through--\"\n \"You boiled the pyramid?\" Sato demanded.\n \"Turn off the flashlight,\" Katherine said. \"Look at the capstone. You can probably still see.\"\n The agent flicked off his light, and Sato knelt down before the capstone. Even from where Langdon was standing, he could see that the text on the capstone was still glowing slightly.\n \"Eight Franklin Square?\" Sato said, sounding amazed.\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am. That text was written with an incandescent lacquer or something. The thirty-third degree was actually--\"\n \"And the address?\" Sato demanded. \"Is this what this guy wants?\"\n \"Yes,\" Langdon said. \"He believes the pyramid is a map that will tell him the location of a great treasure--the key to unlocking the Ancient Mysteries.\"\n Sato looked again at the capstone, her expression one of disbelief. \"Tell me,\" she said, fear creeping into her voice, \"have you contacted this man yet? Have you already given him this address?\"\n \"We tried.\" Langdon explained what had happened when they called the man\u0027s cell phone.\n Sato listened, running her tongue over her yellow teeth as he spoke. Despite looking ready to erupt with anger over the situation, she turned to one of her agents and spoke in a restrained whisper. \"Send him in. He\u0027s in the SUV.\"\n The agent nodded and spoke into his transceiver.\n \"Send who in?\" Langdon said. \"The only person who has any hope of fixing the goddamn mess you made!\"\n \"What mess?\" Langdon fired back. \"Now that Peter is safe, everything is--\"\n \"For Christ\u0027s sake!\" Sato exploded. \"This is not about Peter! I tried to tell you that at the Capitol Building, Professor, but you chose to work against me rather than with me! Now you\u0027ve made an ungodly mess! When you destroyed your cell phone, which, by the way, we were tracking, you cut off your communication with this man. And this address you uncovered--whatever the hell it is--this address was our one chance to catch this lunatic. I needed you to play his game, to provide him with this address so we would know where the hell to catch him!\"\n Before Langdon could reply, Sato directed the remainder of her wrath at Katherine.\n \"And you, Ms. Solomon! You knew where this maniac lived? Why didn\u0027t you tell me? You sent a rent-a-cop to this man\u0027s house? Don\u0027t you see you\u0027ve ruined any chance we had of catching him there? I\u0027m glad your brother is safe, but let me tell you this, we are facing a crisis tonight whose ramifications far outreach your family. They will be felt all around the world. The man who took your brother has enormous power, and we need to catch him immediately.\"\n As she finished her tirade, the tall, elegant silhouette of Warren Bellamy emerged from the shadows and stepped into the sitting room. He looked rumpled, bruised, and shaken . . . like he\u0027d been through hell.\n \"Warren!\" Langdon stood up. \"Are you okay?\"\n \"No,\" he replied. \"Not really.\"\n \"Did you hear? Peter is safe!\"\n Bellamy nodded, looking dazed, as if nothing mattered anymore. \"Yes, I just heard your conversation. I\u0027m glad.\"\n \"Warren, what the hell is going on?\"\n Sato intervened. \"You boys can catch up in a minute. Right now, Mr. Bellamy is going to reach out to this lunatic and communicate with him. Just like he\u0027s been doing all night.\"\n Langdon felt lost. \"Bellamy hasn\u0027t been communicating with this guy tonight! This guy doesn\u0027t even know Bellamy is involved!\"\n Sato turned to Bellamy and raised her eyebrows.\n Bellamy sighed. \"Robert, I\u0027m afraid I haven\u0027t been entirely honest with you this evening.\" Langdon could only stare. \"I thought I was doing the right thing . . .\" Bellamy said, looking frightened. \"Well,\" Sato said, \"now you will do the right thing . . . and we\u0027d all better pray to God it works.\" As if to substantiate Sato\u0027s portentous tone, the mantel clock began chiming the hour. Sato took out a Ziploc bag of items and tossed it to Bellamy. \"Here\u0027s your stuff. Does your cell phone take photos?\"\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\n \"Good. Hold up the capstone.\"\n The message Mal\u0027akh had just received was from his contact--Warren Bellamy--the Mason he had sent to the Capitol Building earlier tonight to assist Robert Langdon. Bellamy, like Langdon, wanted Peter Solomon back alive and had assured Mal\u0027akh he would help Langdon acquire and decipher the pyramid. All night, Mal\u0027akh had been receiving e-mail updates, which had been automatically forwarded to his cell phone.\n This should be interesting, Mal\u0027akh thought, opening the message.\n From: Warren Bellamy\n got separated from langdon\n but finally have info you\n demanded. proof attached.\n call for missing piece. --wb\n --one attachment (jpeg)--\n Call for missing piece? Mal\u0027akh wondered, opening the attachment.\n The attachment was a photo.\n When Mal\u0027akh saw it, he gasped out loud, and he could feel his heart start pounding with excitement. He was looking at a close-up of a tiny golden pyramid. The legendary capstone! The ornate engraving on the face carried a promising message: The secret hides within The Order.\n Beneath the inscription, Mal\u0027akh now saw something that stunned him. The capstone seemed to be glowing. In disbelief, he stared at the faintly radiant text and realized that the legend was literally true: The Masonic Pyramid transforms itself to reveal its secret to the worthy.\n How this magical transformation had occurred, Mal\u0027akh had no idea, and he didn\u0027t care. The glowing text was clearly pointing to a specific location in D.C., exactly as prophesied. Franklin Square. Unfortunately, the photo of the capstone also included Warren Bellamy\u0027s index finger, which was strategically positioned on the capstone to block out a critical piece of information. The\n secret hides\n within The Order\n Franklin Square\n Call for missing piece. Mal\u0027akh now understood Bellamy\u0027s meaning.\n The Architect of the Capitol had been cooperative all night, but now he had chosen to play a very dangerous game.\n CHAPTER 92\n Beneath the watchful gaze of several armed CIA agents, Langdon, Katherine, and Bellamy waited with Sato in the Cathedral College sitting room. On the coffee table before them, Langdon\u0027s leather bag was still open, the golden capstone peeking out the top. The words Eight Franklin Square had now faded away, leaving no evidence that they had ever existed.\n Katherine had pleaded with Sato to let her go see her brother, but Sato had simply shaken her head, eyes fixed on Bellamy\u0027s cell phone. It sat on the coffee table and had yet to ring.\n Why didn\u0027t Bellamy just tell me the truth? Langdon wondered. Apparently, the Architect had been in contact with Peter\u0027s captor all night, reassuring him that Langdon was making progress deciphering the pyramid. It was a bluff, an attempt to buy time for Peter. In fact, Bellamy was doing all he could to interfere with anyone who threatened to unveil the pyramid\u0027s secret. Now, however, it seemed that Bellamy had switched sides. He and Sato were now prepared to risk the pyramid\u0027s secret in hopes of catching this man.\n \"Take your hands off me!\" shouted an elderly voice in the hall. \"I\u0027m blind, not inept! I know my way through the college!\" Dean Galloway was still protesting loudly as a CIA agent manhandled him into the sitting room and forced him into one of the chairs.\n \"Who\u0027s here?\" Galloway demanded, his blank eyes staring dead ahead. \"It sounds like a lot of you. How many do you need to detain an old man? Really now!\"\n \"There are seven of us,\" Sato declared. \"Including Robert Langdon, Katherine Solomon, and your Masonic brother Warren Bellamy.\"\n Galloway slumped, all his bluster gone.\n \"We\u0027re okay,\" Langdon said. \"And we just heard that Peter is safe. He\u0027s in bad shape, but the police are with him.\"\n \"Thank heavens,\" Galloway said. \"And the--\"\n A loud rattling caused everyone in the room to jump. It was Bellamy\u0027s cell phone vibrating against the coffee table. Everyone fell silent.\n \"Okay, Mr. Bellamy,\" Sato said. \"Don\u0027t blow it. You know the stakes.\"\n Bellamy took a deep breath and exhaled. Then he reached down and pressed the speakerphone button to connect the call.\n \"Bellamy here,\" he said, speaking loudly toward the phone on the coffee table.\n The voice that crackled back through the speaker was familiar, an airy whisper. It sounded like he was calling from a hands-free speakerphone inside a car. \"It\u0027s past midnight, Mr. Bellamy. I was about to put Peter out of his misery.\"\n There was an uneasy silence in the room. \"Let me talk to him.\"\n \"Impossible,\" the man replied. \"We\u0027re driving. He\u0027s tied up in the trunk.\"\n Langdon and Katherine exchanged looks and then began shaking their heads at everyone. He\u0027s bluffing! He no longer has Peter!\n Sato motioned for Bellamy to keep pressing.\n \"I want proof that Peter\u0027s alive,\" Bellamy said. \"I\u0027m not giving you the rest of--\"\n \"Your Worshipful Master needs a doctor. Don\u0027t waste time with negotiations. Tell me the street number on Franklin Square, and I\u0027ll bring Peter to you there.\"\n \"I told you, I want--\"\n \"Now!\" the man exploded. \"Or I will pull over and Peter Solomon dies this instant!\"\n \"You listen to me,\" Bellamy said forcefully. \"If you want the rest of the address, you\u0027ll play by my rules. Meet me at Franklin Square. Once you deliver Peter alive, I\u0027ll tell you the number of the building.\"\n \"How do I know you won\u0027t bring the authorities?\" \"Because I can\u0027t risk double-crossing you. Peter\u0027s life is not the only card you hold. I know what\u0027s really at stake tonight.\"\n \"You do realize,\" the man on the phone said, \"that if I sense so much as a hint of anyone other than you at Franklin Square, I will keep driving, and you will never find even a trace of Peter Solomon. And of course . . . that will be the least of your worries.\"\n \"I\u0027ll come alone,\" Bellamy replied somberly. \"When you turn over Peter, I\u0027ll give you everything you need.\"\n \"Center of the square,\" the man said. \"It will take me at least twenty minutes to get there. I suggest you wait for me as long as it takes.\"\n The line went dead.\n Instantly, the room sprang to life. Sato began shouting orders. Several field agents grabbed their radios and headed for the door. \"Move! Move!\"\n In the chaos, Langdon looked to Bellamy for some kind of explanation as to what was actually going on tonight, but the older man was already being hurried out the door.\n \"I need to see my brother!\" Katherine shouted. \"You have to let us go!\"\n Sato walked over to Katherine. \"I don\u0027t have to do anything, Ms. Solomon. Is that clear?\"\n Katherine stood her ground and looked desperately into Sato\u0027s small eyes.\n \"Ms. Solomon, my top priority is apprehending the man at Franklin Square, and you will sit here with one of my men until I accomplish that task. Then, and only then, will we deal with your brother.\"\n \"You\u0027re missing the point,\" Katherine said. \"I know exactly where this man lives! It\u0027s literally five minutes up the road in Kalorama Heights, and there will be evidence there that will help you! Besides, you said you want to keep this quiet. Who knows what Peter will start telling the authorities once he\u0027s stabilized.\"\n Sato pursed her lips, apparently registering Katherine\u0027s point. Outside, the chopper blades began winding up. Sato frowned and then turned to one of her men. \"Hartmann, you take the Escalade. Transport Ms. Solomon and Mr. Langdon to Kalorama Heights. Peter Solomon is not to speak to anyone. Is that understood?\"\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" the agent said.\n \"Call me when you get there. Tell me what you find. And don\u0027t let these two out of your sight.\" Agent Hartmann gave a quick nod, pulled out the Escalade keys, and headed for the door.\n Katherine was right behind him.\n Sato turned to Langdon. \"I\u0027ll see you shortly, Professor. I know you think I\u0027m the enemy, but I can assure you that\u0027s not the case. Get to Peter at once. This isn\u0027t over yet.\"\n Off to one side of Langdon, Dean Galloway was sitting quietly at the coffee table. His hands had found the stone pyramid, which was still sitting in Langdon\u0027s open leather bag on the table in front of him. The old man was running his hands over the stone\u0027s warm surface.\n Langdon said, \"Father, are you coming to see Peter?\"\n \"I\u0027d just slow you down.\" Galloway removed his hands from the bag and zipped it up around the pyramid. \"I\u0027ll stay right here and pray for Peter\u0027s recovery. We can all speak later. But when you show Peter the pyramid, would you please tell him something for me?\"\n \"Of course.\" Langdon hoisted the bag onto his shoulder.\n \"Tell him this.\" Galloway cleared his throat. \"The Masonic Pyramid has always kept her secret . . . sincerely.\"\n \"I don\u0027t understand.\"\n The old man winked. \"Just tell Peter that. He will understand.\"\n With that, Dean Galloway bowed his head and began praying.\n Perplexed, Langdon left him there and hurried outside. Katherine was already in the front seat of the SUV giving the agent directions. Langdon climbed in back and had barely closed the door before the giant vehicle was rocketing across the lawn, racing northward to Kalorama Heights. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lost-symbol-robert-langdon-3/page-26.html","bookId":1515,"book":{"id":1515,"title":"The Lost Symbol (Robert Langdon #3)","description":"Storyline: \n In 1991, a document was locked in the safe of the director of the CIA.
