{"id":62410,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"CHAPTER 33\n Systems security specialist Mark Zoubianis was sinking deeper into his futon and scowling at the information on his laptop screen.\n What the hell kind of address is this?\n His best hacking tools were entirely ineffective at breaking into the document or at unmasking Trish\u0027s mysterious IP address. Ten minutes had passed, and Zoubianis\u0027s program was still pounding away in vain at the network firewalls. They showed little hope of penetration. No wonder they\u0027re overpaying me. He was about to retool and try a different approach when his phone rang.\n Trish, for Christ\u0027s sake, I said I\u0027d call you. He muted the football game and answered. \"Yeah?\"\n \"Is this Mark Zoubianis?\" a man asked. \"At 357 Kingston Drive in Washington?\"\n Zoubianis could hear other muffled conversations in the background. A telemarketer during the play-offs? Are they insane? \"Let me guess, I won a week in Anguilla?\"\n \"No,\" the voice replied with no trace of humor. \"This is systems security for the Central Intelligence Agency. We would like to know why you are attempting to hack one of our classified databases?\"\n Three stories above the Capitol Building\u0027s subbasement, in the wide-open spaces of the visitor center, security guard Nunez locked the main entry doors as he did every night at this time. As he headed back across the expansive marble floors, he thought of the man in the army-surplus jacket with the tattoos.\n I let him in. Nunez wondered if he would have a job tomorrow.\n As he headed toward the escalator, a sudden pounding on the outside doors caused him to turn. He squinted back toward the main entrance and saw an elderly African American man outside, rapping on the glass with his open palm and motioning to be let in.\n Nunez shook his head and pointed to his watch.\n The man pounded again and stepped into the light. He was immaculately dressed in a blue suit and had close-cropped graying hair. Nunez\u0027s pulse quickened. Holy shit. Even at a distance, Nunez now recognized who this man was. He hurried back to the entrance and unlocked the door. \"I\u0027m sorry, sir. Please, please come in.\"\n Warren Bellamy--Architect of the Capitol--stepped across the threshold and thanked Nunez with a polite nod. Bellamy was lithe and slender, with an erect posture and piercing gaze that exuded the confidence of a man in full control of his surroundings. For the last twenty-five years, Bellamy had served as the supervisor of the U.S. Capitol.\n \"May I help you, sir?\" Nunez asked.\n \"Thank you, yes.\" Bellamy enunciated his words with crisp precision. As a northeastern Ivy League graduate, his diction was so exacting he sounded almost British. \"I\u0027ve just learned that you had an incident here this evening.\" He looked deeply concerned.\n \"Yes, sir. It was--\"\n \"Where\u0027s Chief Anderson?\"\n \"Downstairs with Director Sato from the CIA\u0027s Office of Security.\"\n Bellamy\u0027s eyes widened with concern. \"The CIA is here?\"\n \"Yes, sir. Director Sato arrived almost immediately after the incident.\"\n \"Why?\" Bellamy demanded.\n Nunez shrugged. As if I was going to ask?\n Bellamy strode directly toward the escalators. \"Where are they?\"\n \"They just went to the lower levels.\" Nunez hastened after him.\n Bellamy glanced back with a look of concern. \"Downstairs? Why?\" \"I don\u0027t really know--I just heard it on my radio.\"\n Bellamy was moving faster now. \"Take me to them right away.\"\n \"Yes, sir.\"\n As the two men hurried across the open expanse, Nunez caught a glimpse of a large golden ring on Bellamy\u0027s finger.\n Nunez pulled out his radio. \"I\u0027ll alert the chief that you\u0027re coming down.\"\n \"No.\" Bellamy\u0027s eyes flashed dangerously. \"I\u0027d prefer to be unannounced.\"\n Nunez had made some big mistakes tonight, but failing to alert Chief Anderson that the Architect was now in the building would be his last. \"Sir?\" he said, uneasy. \"I think Chief Anderson would prefer--\"\n \"You are aware that I employ Mr. Anderson?\" Bellamy said.\n Nunez nodded.\n \"Then I think he would prefer you obey my wishes.\"\n CHAPTER 34\n Trish Dunne entered the SMSC lobby and looked up with surprise. The guest waiting here looked nothing like the usual bookish, flannel-clad doctors who entered this building--those of anthropology, oceanography, geology, and other scientific fields. Quite to the contrary, Dr. Abaddon looked almost aristocratic in his impeccably tailored suit. He was tall, with a broad torso, well-tanned face, and perfectly combed blond hair that gave Trish the impression he was more accustomed to luxuries than to laboratories.\n \"Dr. Abaddon, I presume?\" Trish said, extending her hand.\n The man looked uncertain, but he took Trish\u0027s plump hand in his broad palm. \"I\u0027m sorry. And you are?\"\n \"Trish Dunne,\" she replied. \"I\u0027m Katherine\u0027s assistant. She asked me to escort you back to her lab.\"\n \"Oh, I see.\" The man smiled now. \"Very nice to meet you, Trish. My apologies if I seemed confused. I was under the impression Katherine was here alone this evening.\" He motioned down the hall. \"But I\u0027m all yours. Lead the way.\"\n Despite the man\u0027s quick recovery, Trish had seen the flash of disappointment in his eyes. She now suspected the motive for Katherine\u0027s secrecy earlier about Dr. Abaddon. A budding romance, maybe? Katherine never discussed her social life, but her visitor was attractive and well-groomed, and although younger than Katherine, he clearly came from her world of wealth and privilege. Nonetheless, whatever Dr. Abaddon had imagined tonight\u0027s visit might entail, Trish\u0027s presence did not seem to be part of his plan.\n At the lobby\u0027s security checkpoint, a lone guard quickly pulled off his headphones, and Trish could hear the Redskins game blaring. The guard put Dr. Abaddon through the usual visitor routine of metal detectors and temporary security badges. \"Who\u0027s winning?\" Dr. Abaddon said affably as he emptied his pockets of a cell phone, some keys, and a cigarette lighter.\n \"Skins by three,\" the guard said, sounding eager to get back. \"Helluva game.\"\n \"Mr. Solomon will be arriving shortly,\" Trish told the guard. \"Would you please send him back to the lab once he arrives?\"\n \"Will do.\" The guard gave an appreciative wink as they passed through. \"Thanks for the heads- up. I\u0027ll look busy.\"\n Trish\u0027s comment had been not only for the benefit of the guard but also to remind Dr. Abaddon that Trish was not the only one intruding on his private evening here with Katherine.\n \"So how do you know Katherine?\" Trish asked, glancing up at the mysterious guest.\n Dr. Abaddon chuckled. \"Oh, it\u0027s a long story. We\u0027ve been working on something together.\"\n Understood, Trish thought. None of my business.\n \"This is an amazing facility,\" Abaddon said, glancing around as they moved down the massive corridor. \"I\u0027ve never actually been here.\"\n His airy tone was becoming more genial with every step, and Trish noticed he was actively taking it all in. In the bright lights of the hallway, she also noticed that his face looked like he had a fake tan. Odd. Nonetheless, as they navigated the deserted corridors, Trish gave him a general synopsis of the SMSC\u0027s purpose and function, including the various pods and their contents.\n The visitor looked impressed. \"Sounds like this place has a treasure trove of priceless artifacts. I would have expected guards posted everywhere.\"\n \"No need,\" Trish said, motioning to the row of fish-eye lenses lining the ceiling high above. \"Security here is automated. Every inch of this corridor is recorded twenty-four/seven, and this corridor is the spine of the facility. It\u0027s impossible to access any of the rooms off this corridor without a key card and PIN number.\"\n \"Efficient use of cameras.\"\n \"Knock on wood, we\u0027ve never had a theft. Then again, this is not the kind of museum anyone would rob--there\u0027s not much call on the black market for extinct flowers, Inuit kayaks, or giant squid carcasses.\"\n Dr. Abaddon chuckled. \"I suppose you\u0027re right.\" \"Our biggest security threat is rodents and insects.\" Trish explained how the building prevented insect infestations by freezing all SMSC refuse and also by an architectural feature called a \"dead zone\"--an inhospitable compartment between double walls, which surrounded the entire building like a sheath.\n \"Incredible,\" Abaddon said. \"So, where is Katherine and Peter\u0027s lab?\"\n \"Pod Five,\" Trish said. \"It\u0027s all the way at the end of this hallway.\"\n Abaddon halted suddenly, spinning to his right, toward a small window. \"My word! Will you look at that!\"\n Trish laughed. \"Yeah, that\u0027s Pod Three. They call it Wet Pod.\"\n \"Wet?\" Abaddon said, face pressed to the glass.\n \"There are over three thousand gallons of liquid ethanol in there. Remember the giant squid carcass I mentioned earlier?\"\n \"That\u0027s the squid?!\" Dr. Abaddon turned from the window momentarily, his eyes wide. \"It\u0027s huge!\"\n \"A female Architeuthis,\" Trish said. \"She\u0027s over forty feet.\"\n Dr. Abaddon, apparently enraptured by the sight of the squid, seemed unable to pull his eyes away from the glass. For a moment, the grown man reminded Trish of a little boy at a pet-store window, wishing he could go in and see a puppy. Five seconds later, he was still staring longingly through the window.\n \"Okay, okay,\" Trish finally said, laughing as she inserted her key card and typed her PIN number. \"Come on. I\u0027ll show you the squid.\"\n As Mal\u0027akh stepped into the dimly lit world of Pod 3, he scanned the walls for security cameras. Katherine\u0027s pudgy little assistant began rattling on about the specimens in this room. Mal\u0027akh tuned her out. He had no interest whatsoever in giant squids. His only interest was in using this dark, private space to solve an unexpected problem.\n CHAPTER 35\n The wooden stairs descending to the Capitol\u0027s subbasement were as steep and shallow as any stairs Langdon had ever traversed. His breathing was faster now, and his lungs felt tight. The air down here was cold and damp, and Langdon couldn\u0027t help but flash on a similar set of stairs he had taken a few years back into the Vatican\u0027s Necropolis. The City of the Dead.\n Ahead of him, Anderson led the way with his flashlight. Behind Langdon, Sato followed closely, her tiny hands occasionally pressing into Langdon\u0027s back. I\u0027m going as fast as I can. Langdon inhaled deeply, trying to ignore the cramped walls on either side of him. There was barely room for his shoulders on this staircase, and his daybag now scraped down the sidewall.\n \"Maybe you should leave your bag above,\" Sato offered behind him.\n \"I\u0027m fine,\" Langdon replied, having no intention of letting it out of his sight. He pictured Peter\u0027s little package and could not begin to imagine how it might relate to anything in the subbasement of the U.S. Capitol.\n \"Just a few more steps,\" Anderson said. \"Almost there.\"\n The group had descended into darkness, moving beyond the reach of the staircase\u0027s lone lightbulb. When Langdon stepped off the final wooden tread, he could feel that the floor beneath his feet was dirt. Journey to the center of the Earth. Sato stepped down behind him.\n Anderson now raised his beam, examining their surroundings. The subbasement was less of a basement than it was an ultranarrow corridor that ran perpendicular to the stairs. Anderson shone his light left and then right, and Langdon could see the passage was only about fifty feet long and lined on both sides with small wooden doors. The doors abutted one another so closely that the rooms behind them could not have been more than ten feet wide.\n ACME Storage meets the Catacombs of Domatilla, Langdon thought as Anderson consulted the blueprint. The tiny section depicting the subbasement was marked with an X to show the location of SBB13. Langdon couldn\u0027t help but notice that the layout was identical to a fourteen-tomb mausoleum--seven vaults facing seven vaults--with one removed to accommodate the stairs they had just descended. Thirteen in all. He suspected America\u0027s \"thirteen\" conspiracy theorists would have a field day if they knew there were exactly thirteen storage rooms buried beneath the U.S. Capitol. Some found it suspicious that the Great Seal of the United States had thirteen stars, thirteen arrows, thirteen pyramid steps, thirteen shield stripes, thirteen olive leaves, thirteen olives, thirteen letters in annuit coeptis, thirteen letters in e pluribus unum, and on and on.\n \"It does look abandoned,\" Anderson said, shining the beam into the chamber directly in front of them. The heavy wooden door was wide open. The shaft of light illuminated a narrow stone chamber--about ten feet wide by some thirty feet deep--like a dead-end hallway to nowhere. The chamber contained nothing more than a couple of old collapsed wooden boxes and some crumpled packing paper.\n Anderson shone his light on a copper plate mounted on the door. The plate was covered with verdigris, but the old marking was legible:\n SBB IV\n \"SBB Four,\" Anderson said.\n \"Which one is SBB Thirteen?\" Sato asked, faint wisps of steam curling out of her mouth in the cold subterranean air.\n Anderson turned the beam toward the south end of the corridor. \"Down there.\"\n Langdon peered down the narrow passage and shivered, feeling a light sweat despite the cold.\n As they moved through the phalanx of doorways, all of the rooms looked the same, doors ajar, apparently abandoned long ago. When they reached the end of the line, Anderson turned to his right, raising the beam to peer into room SBB13. The flashlight beam, however, was impeded by a heavy wooden door.\n Unlike the others, the door to SBB13 was closed.\n This final door looked exactly like the others--heavy hinges, iron handle, and a copper number plate encrusted with green. The seven characters on the number plate were the same characters on Peter\u0027s palm upstairs.\n SBB XIII\n Please tell me the door is locked, Langdon thought.\n Sato spoke without hesitation. \"Try the door.\"\n The police chief looked uneasy, but he reached out, grasped the heavy iron handle, and pushed down on it. The handle didn\u0027t budge. He shone the light now, illuminating a heavy, old- fashioned lock plate and keyhole.\n \"Try the master key,\" Sato said.\n Anderson produced the main key from the entry door upstairs, but it was not even close to fitting.\n \"Am I mistaken,\" Sato said, her tone sarcastic, \"or shouldn\u0027t Security have access to every corner of a building in case of emergency?\"\n Anderson exhaled and looked back at Sato. \"Ma\u0027am, my men are checking for a secondary key, but--\"\n \"Shoot the lock,\" she said, nodding toward the key plate beneath the lever.\n Langdon\u0027s pulse leaped.\n Anderson cleared his throat, sounding uneasy. \"Ma\u0027am, I\u0027m waiting for news on a secondary key. I am not sure I\u0027m comfortable blasting our way into--\"\n \"Perhaps you\u0027d be more comfortable in prison for obstructing a CIA investigation?\"\n Anderson looked incredulous. After a long beat, he reluctantly handed the light to Sato and unsnapped his holster.\n \"Wait!\" Langdon said, no longer able to stand idly by. \"Think about it. Peter gave up his right hand rather than reveal whatever might be behind this door. Are you sure we want to do this? Unlocking this door is essentially complying with the demands of a terrorist.\" \"Do you want to get Peter Solomon back?\" Sato asked.\n \"Of course, but--\"\n \"Then I suggest you do exactly what his captor is requesting.\"\n \"Unlock an ancient portal? You think this is the portal?\"\n Sato shone the light in Langdon\u0027s face. \"Professor, I have no idea what the hell this is. Whether it\u0027s a storage unit or the secret entrance to an ancient pyramid, I intend to open it. Do I make myself clear?\"\n Langdon squinted into the light and finally nodded.\n Sato lowered the beam and redirected it at the door\u0027s antique key plate. \"Chief? Go ahead.\"\n Still looking averse to the plan, Anderson extracted his sidearm very, very slowly, gazing down at it with uncertainty.\n \"Oh, for God\u0027s sake!\" Sato\u0027s tiny hands shot out, and she grabbed the weapon from him. She stuffed the flashlight into his now empty palm. \"Shine the damned light.\" She handled the gun with the confidence of someone who had trained with weapons, wasting no time turning off the pistol\u0027s safety, cocking the weapon, and aiming at the lock.\n \"Wait!\" Langdon yelled, but he was too late.\n The gun roared three times.\n Langdon\u0027s eardrums felt like they had exploded. Is she insane?! The gunshots in the tiny space had been deafening.\n Anderson also looked shaken, his hand wavering a bit as he shone the flashlight on the bullet- riddled door.\n The lock mechanism was now in tatters, the wood surrounding it entirely pulverized. The lock had released, the door now having fallen ajar.\n Sato extended the pistol and pressed the tip of the barrel against the door, giving it a push. The door swung fully into the blackness beyond.\n Langdon peered in but could see nothing in the darkness. What in the world is that smell? An unusual, fetid odor wafted out of the darkness.\n Anderson stepped into the doorway and shone the light on the floor, tracing carefully down the length of the barren dirt floor. This room was like the others--a long, narrow space. The sidewalls were rugged stone, giving the room the feel of an ancient prison cell. But that smell . . . \"There\u0027s nothing here,\" Anderson said, moving the beam farther down the chamber floor. Finally, as the beam reached the end of the floor, he raised it up to illuminate the chamber\u0027s farthest wall.\n \"My God . . . !\" Anderson shouted.\n Everyone saw it and jumped back.\n Langdon stared in disbelief at the deepest recess of the chamber.\n To his horror, something was staring back.\n CHAPTER 36\n \"What in God\u0027s name . . . ?\" At the threshold of SBB13, Anderson fumbled with his light and retreated a step.\n Langdon also recoiled, as did Sato, who looked startled for the first time all night.\n Sato aimed the gun at the back wall and motioned for Anderson to shine the light again. Anderson raised the light. The beam was dim by the time it reached the far wall, but the light was enough to illuminate the shape of a pallid and ghostly face, staring back at them through lifeless sockets.\n A human skull.\n The skull sat atop a rickety wooden desk positioned against the rear wall of the chamber. Two human leg bones sat beside the skull, along with a collection of other items that were meticulously arranged on the desk in shrinelike fashion--an antique hourglass, a crystal flask, a candle, two saucers of pale powder, and a sheet of paper. Propped against the wall beside the desk stood the fearsome shape of a long scythe, its curved blade as familiar as that of the grim reaper.\n Sato stepped into the room. \"Well, now . . . it appears Peter Solomon keeps more secrets than I imagined.\"\n Anderson nodded, inching after her. \"Talk about skeletons in your closet.\" He raised the light and surveyed the rest of the empty chamber. \"And that smell?\" he added, crinkling his nose. \"What is it?\" \"Sulfur,\" Langdon replied evenly behind them. \"There should be two saucers on the desk. The saucer on the right will contain salt. And the other sulfur.\"\n Sato wheeled in disbelief. \"How the hell would you know that?!\"\n \"Because, ma\u0027am, there are rooms exactly like this all over the world.\"\n One story above the subbasement, Capitol security guard Nunez escorted the Architect of the Capitol, Warren Bellamy, down the long hallway that ran the length of the eastern basement. Nunez could have sworn that he had just heard three gunshots down here, muffled and underground.\n There\u0027s no way.\n \"Subbasement door is open,\" Bellamy said, squinting down the hallway at a door that stood ajar in the distance.\n Strange evening indeed, Nunez thought. Nobody goes down there. \"I\u0027ll be glad to find out what\u0027s going on,\" he said, reaching for his radio.\n \"Go back to your duties,\" Bellamy said. \"I\u0027m fine from here.\"\n Nunez shifted uneasily. \"You sure?\"\n Warren Bellamy stopped, placing a firm hand on Nunez\u0027s shoulder. \"Son, I\u0027ve worked here for twenty-five years. I think I can find my way.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lost-symbol-robert-langdon-3/page-12.html","bookId":1515,"book":{"id":1515,"title":"The Lost Symbol (Robert Langdon #3)","description":"Storyline: \n In 1991, a document was locked in the safe of the director of the CIA.
