Drizzt led Wulfgar off to the side, out of plain view. Seeing the barbarian\u0027s paling look, he took the tiny pouch and gingerly loosened the draw string, holding it as far away as possible. With a shrug to Wulfgar, who had moved a cautious step away, Drizzt brought the pouch down to his belt level and peeked in. Wulfgar moved closer, curious and concerned when he saw Drizzt\u0027s shoulders droop. The drow looked to him in helpless resignation and inverted the pouch, revealing its contents.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-halfling-s-gem-the-icewind-dale-trilogy-3.jpg","author":"R.A.
