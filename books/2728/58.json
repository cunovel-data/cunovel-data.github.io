No arguments.” When she leaves to go get me a clutch, Lil says, “Just promise me you won’t smoke in my dress.” “I won’t. I’ve been really good lately.” Lillia gives me a look like she doesn’t believe me. “Smoking gives you wrinkles around your mouth, did you know that? Plus, and I’m sorry to say this, but it makes your clothes stink.” I groan. “Stop with the lectures, Lillia!” As prim as can be, she says, “Fine, but please just don’t smoke in my dress, that’s all I ask.” I roll my eyes. We’re going back and forth over how to do my hair and what color lipstick, when I notice Nadia standing outside Lillia’s door with her arms crossed. Reminds me of when she was a kid and she would spy on Lil and Rennie and me. Our eyes meet. She says, “That color lipstick isn’t right for her. It’s too bright. It should be darker. Richer. More like burgundy.” Surprised, Lillia says, “I don’t know if I have anything that dark.” “I do,” Nadia says with a begrudging sigh. I wink at her. “Thanks, beotch.” She gives me a tiny smile back and disappears to find the lipstick. Lil falls back onto her bed and says, “I’m sad that high school’s almost over. It feels like you and I just found each other again but we already have to say good-bye.” “Lil, we have the whole summer! Let’s just make it amazing, all right?” Lil nods a teary kind of nod. I go sit next to her on the bed, and in an instant we’re hugging and crying. Over Rennie, over Mary, over everything. Chapter Fifty-Nine LILLIA “MOVE CLOSER TOGETHER, YOU TWO,” Celeste urges as Alex’s dad snaps away with his fancy Leica camera. She’s at his side, directing every shot. We’re outside by our pool, and my parents are sitting on a chaise, drinking champagne and smiling at us fondly. We’ve already done shots with us by ourselves, with our parents, with each other’s parents, pretty much every combo you can think of, all at Celeste’s behest. The way Celeste is acting, you’d think this was our wedding day. She had Alex’s dad take like fifty shots of Alex putting on my wrist corsage. It’s a calla lily. Just like his boutonniere. I’ve got on the white Hermès bracelet Alex gave me. I showed it to him as soon as I walked in the door. He started to compliment my dress, but I kept holding up the bracelet in front of his face and saying, “Isn’t it so cute?” which made him laugh. I do love my dress, though. It could be a wedding gown, if it was white. I borrowed it from my mom—it’s mint-green silk chiffon with a keyhole in the pleated front. The straps are twisted into ropes, and the back is completely open. My mom bought me a crystal belt to wear with it. My hair is up, away from my face in soft waves. I couldn’t have worn the dress I bought with Reeve. It wouldn’t have felt right. That was a dress for another girl, another night. I doubt I’ll ever wear it. I should just tell Kat she can keep it. Alex’s arm tightens around my waist. He looks more handsome than I’ve ever seen him. His hair is freshly cut, and his tux looks like it was made for him. Which, knowing Celeste, it probably was. Her philosophy is that every man should have a custom-made tux. “Lillia, find your light,” she calls out. My mom and I exchange a look. I swear, just because Celeste watches reality shows about modeling and photography, she thinks she’s an expert. My mom’s the one who actually used to be a model! Through my smile I whisper to Alex, “Can you say something? We’re going to miss the whole prom if we don’t get out of here. Which would be weird, since it’s at your house!” Thank God Celeste is spending the evening here, instead of chaperoning the prom. I can only imagine how she’d follow Alex around all night. I hold back a giggle. She’d probably want to slow-dance with him. Alex nods, drops his arm, and says, “I think we’ve got enough pictures, Mom.” “But we didn’t get one with just you and Nadia.” She pouts. Nadia’s long gone, back up to her room. She posed for a few shots and then got bored. “Mom,” Alex protests. “Just go get her,” I say with a sigh. “And then we’ll go.” Alex bounds off, and Celeste comes over and puts her arm around me. “I get so happy thinking about the possibility of you and Alex in Boston together,” she says. “Your mom and I can do a girls’ weekend and visit you guys every—” “What do you mean? Isn’t Alex going to USC?” I saw the acceptance letter on his desk last week. She shakes her head. With a knowing smile she says, “You never know!” My cheeks flush. Alex could be in Boston with me. I am flooded with memories of our great weekend there together, when we almost kissed. I don’t want to assume he’d be going for me, obviously, because we’re just friends. The one thing I do know is that Alex giving up his dream is the last thing I want. Chapter Sixty KAT I WRAP THE LAST SECTION of my hair around the barrel of the curling iron as quickly as I can without burning the shit out of my arm, which I’ve done twice already. I flip my head over and shake out the curls and then give my whole head a spritz of hair spray. My hair is still damp from my shower, and the curl isn’t holding great. It’s looking more beach waves than vamp curls, but whatever. It’ll have to do. I’m in my black strapless bra and underwear, no makeup on, and I’m supposed to be at Reeve’s house in five minutes to take pictures. I suck at time management. I race around my room shoving shit into Mrs. Cho’s beaded clutch. Nadia’s lipstick, a couple of Band-Aids. I’ve got one smudge stick left from what I made to burn in Reeve’s room, and I stick that in there too, just in case. I hurry downstairs. The house is empty. I have no idea where Pat and my dad are. Maybe working on one of Dad’s canoes. Business has picked up again now that the tourists are back. He already has enough orders to last him through summer. Dad’s been training Pat for the last few weeks, which is good. Pat needs a long-term plan. He can’t ride bikes and f**k around in Dad’s garage forever. I slip on Mrs. Cho’s stilettos. They are so freaking hot, I almost wish this dress was short, so I could really show them off. Then I head out the front door. On the landing I quick light a cigarette and take a few puffs. I know Lillia told me not to smoke in her dress, but I need something to calm me down. I’m nervous, about tonight going well, and of course about Mary. I’ll get the thing dry-cleaned. She’ll never notice.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ashes-to-ashes-burn-for-burn-3/page-58.html","bookId":2728,"book":{"id":2728,"title":"Ashes to Ashes (Burn for Burn #3)","description":"Storyline: New Year\u0027s Eve ended with a bang and Mary, Kat and Lillia may not be prepared for what is to come.
