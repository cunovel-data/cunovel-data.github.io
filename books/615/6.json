{"id":45235,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI A VISIT TO NEW YORK","content":"On the following Friday Dan and Gerald, suit-cases in hand and ulsters on arm, climbed aboard the express at a little before five o’clock and set out for New York. It was a cloudy afternoon, still and moderately cold. The river had been frozen for several days, and as the train crossed the bridge the boys could see the skaters moving about through the twilight up near Loon Island. They had their supper on the train—although it was really dinner—and did their level best to eat some of everything on the menu. In this effort they were not quite successful, but they managed to consume enough to interfere seriously with their comfort. Luckily they had a full hour—and it really was a full one—in which to recover before the train rolled into the Grand Central Station, by which time they were able to take up their luggage and traverse the platform without more than an occasional groan. \n \n Mr. Pennimore had half promised to meet them, but when Gerald had discovered the electric[56] brougham, the driver, a very smart looking youth in trim livery, reported that Mr. Pennimore had telephoned from downtown that he wouldn’t be able to reach the station in time, but would meet the boys at dinner. \n \n “Dinner!” groaned Dan, casting a reproachful look at Gerald. “Why didn’t you tell me we were to have dinner after we got here?” \n \n “I thought it would be lots more fun to eat on the train,” replied Gerald. “You can eat at home any time. Besides, we were hungry, Dan.” \n \n “Well, that’s so. But I’m not hungry now, and I know I shan’t be able to even look at the table.” \n \n They sped softly across town, only the low buzz of the motor and the occasional jangle of the bell penetrating to the interior of the carriage. Overhead a light set behind ground glass cast a soft glow over the rich upholstery. Dan looked and marveled. At his feet an electric heater gave warmth, in front of him a little silver clock ticked away the minutes. The seat, upholstered in dark blue leather, was as comfortable as a bed, and Gerald was making the most of it. But Dan was too excited to loll back in his corner. Instead, he sat on the edge of the cushion and peered interestedly out of the window. The brougham slowed down and turned into Fifth Avenue, then buzzed its way uptown past a steady stream of southward[57] bound vehicles, automobiles, hansoms, broughams, taxicabs, electrics, with now and then a smart delivery wagon. Dan turned in bewilderment. \n \n “Where’s every one going?” he asked. \n \n “Theater, I suppose,” answered Gerald listlessly. “It’s most eight o’clock.” \n \n “Oh,” said Dan. He had never seen so many carriages before in his life, nor so many lights, nor so many persons. They were held up for a moment at an intersecting street, and he watched admiringly the majestic traffic policeman, and wondered where every one could be going! Then they went on again and the lights along the sidewalks grew fewer. Shops gave way to residences, and soon, through the window on Gerald’s side, he saw the Park. He heaved a sigh. \n \n “Gee, this is a big old place, Gerald,” he said hopelessly. \n \n “I hate it,” answered Gerald, arousing from his drowsiness. “I have lots more fun at Sound View than I do in New York. I wish father would live at Sound View all the year. He says he’s going to some day. Here we are, Dan.” \n \n The brougham rolled slowly up to the curb and stopped with a final peal of its bell. The door of a white stone residence opened and a man in livery came out and seized the bags and coats.[58] Dan followed Gerald into the house, stepped dazedly into a tiny room which turned out to be an elevator, stepped out again and discovered Mr. Pennimore awaiting them at the door of a big library, evening paper in hand. After that events followed each other so quickly that it was all rather hazy to Dan. There was a moment’s chat in front of a glowing fire, another excursion in the elevator, a hurried preparation for dinner, followed by a survey of Gerald’s bedroom and sitting room which adjoined the apartment assigned to Dan, a descent to the first floor, and—well, then Dan found himself eating again just as though he hadn’t already had one hearty dinner that evening! \n \n “What’s the matter, Gerald?” asked Mr. Pennimore presently, interrupting himself anxiously. “Has coming home spoiled your appetite?” \n \n “No, sir, but we had our dinner on the train.” \n \n “On the train! Well, well, that’s unfortunate! Couldn’t wait, eh? But do the best you can, boys. When I was your age I could always eat. Parker, hand the vegetables to Mr. Vinton.” \n \n When dinner was over it was much too late to go anywhere, Mr. Pennimore decided. Gerald was disappointed, but Dan was secretly glad enough to sit down in a big, sleepy chair in front of the library fire and just let the comfort and[59] hominess of the place soak in. Mr. Pennimore found lots of questions to ask, and it kept the two boys busy answering them. \n \n “You see, son,” said Mr. Pennimore, “your letters are very interesting, but you’ve got an exasperating way of paying no attention to the questions I ask in mine. Have you been homesick, Gerald?” \n \n Gerald shot a glance at Dan, but that youth was studying the flames as though he hadn’t heard the question. \n \n “Some, sir,” answered Gerald, “once or twice.” \n \n “Getting over it now, though, I presume? That’s right; just realize that Yardley’s to be your home for the next few months and get settled down. Have you made the acquaintance of any more of the boys?” \n \n “I—I don’t know any of them very well yet, sir.” \n \n “Of course not; all that takes time, I suspect. You spoke of two of the boys in one of your letters. What were their names?” \n \n “Loring and Dyer,” answered Gerald. “They’re—they’re Second Class fellows, and so I don’t know them very well.” \n \n “Oh, I gathered from what you wrote that you did.” Gerald looked uneasily at Dan. \n \n “Well, Loring’s going to give you boxing lessons,”[60] he said. “You know him well enough for that. Gerald has an idea that fellows don’t care about him unless they come right out and say so,” Dan explained. \n \n “Boxing lessons, you said?” inquired Mr. Pennimore. “Isn’t boxing rather—er—strenuous for a boy of your age?” He looked anxiously from Dan to Gerald. \n \n “Oh, no, sir,” answered Dan promptly. “It isn’t hard at all. It’s one of the regular exercises in the Second Class. Gerald just thought he’d like to take it up now, and Alf Loring said he’d show him how. It’s good exercise, sir.” \n \n Gerald breathed easier. He had pledged Dan to secrecy in regard to his trouble with Thompson, and Dan’s unthinking reference to boxing had brought his heart into his mouth. \n \n “Well,” said his father doubtfully, “be careful. Don’t try to learn everything the first year, son.” \n \n The next forenoon was given over to sight-seeing. Gerald acted as guide and showed Dan as many of the points of interest as there was time for, and Dan enjoyed himself hugely. They had luncheon with Mr. Pennimore at his club. Afterwards he handed them tickets for one of the theaters and sent them off in a hansom. \n \n “I’m sorry I can’t go with you,” he said, “but I’ve got a great deal to do this afternoon. We’ll[61] have dinner early and see a show together to-night.” \n \n That was Dan’s first visit to a real theater, for out in Graystone, Ohio, where he lived, the local playhouse, known as the Academy of Music, was little more than a fair-sized hall, and the attractions which visited it seldom met with the approval of Dan’s parents. To Gerald, on the contrary, theaters and plays were an old story, and he found half of his enjoyment in watching Dan and in displaying his own knowledge and experience of things theatrical. After the final curtain had fallen Dan didn’t say anything until the boys were out on the street. Then he drew a long breath, sighed deeply, and exclaimed: \n \n “Gee, that was great!” \n \n “It wasn’t a bad show,” replied Gerald indifferently. \n \n “Bad! It was simply elegant! I’ll bet if I lived in New York I’d be at the theater every day! I’d like to see that play again to-night!” \n \n But instead he saw another one and voted it even better, and would have kept Gerald up the rest of the night talking about it if Gerald had allowed it. Even as it was, it was long past mid-night when they fell asleep. The next forenoon they went to church with Mr. Pennimore. The church was a new source of wonderment to Dan.[62] He had never imagined that a church could be so beautiful as was that one, and if he missed a great deal of the service, it was only because his eyes and thoughts were busy with the great altar, the wonderful stained glass windows, and all the architectural marvels and color before him. \n \n Dinner was at two o’clock on Sunday, a long-drawn-out repast of many courses. It wasn’t altogether a success to-day, for every one was rather silent. The impending return to school brought no joy to the boys, while Mr. Pennimore was saddened by the thought of having to part with Gerald for several months. At a little before four the electric brougham rolled up to the curb in front of the house, and good-byes were said. Mr. Pennimore was to sail early Tuesday morning. Gerald begged to be allowed to remain in town and see him off, but his father wouldn’t allow it. \n \n “No, no,” he said smilingly, “that wouldn’t do, son. Why, I might lose my courage at the last moment and take you with me!” \n \n “I wish you would,” said Gerald dismally, clinging tightly to his father’s hand. \n \n “What? And take you away from school? Oh, that wouldn’t do at all. No, we’ll say good-bye now, Gerald. You write me regularly and send your first letter to the address I gave you, so that I’ll find it when I get to London. Good-bye,[63] Dan. Take good care of yourself. We three are going to have some good times this summer, and I want you well and strong. And keep an eye on this boy here; don’t let him get into too much mischief. And write me a letter yourself some day and put it in with Gerald’s. Now, you’ll have to hurry if you’re going to catch that train. Good-bye, Gerald. Be a good boy, and don’t forget to write to me. Remember me to the Doctor when you see him. Good-bye, good-bye!” \n \n Then they were rolling away to the station, Gerald rather tearful, and Dan feeling a little bit blue himself, without being able to find a good reason for it. But by the time New Haven was reached the spirits of each had risen considerably, and they were able to take some interest in the things which the waiter placed before them in the dining car. Neither had eaten much dinner in New York, and so they found that they had very fair appetites. It’s wonderful what food will do in the way of cheering one up! When they tossed their bags into the carriage at Wissining and climbed in after them they were as merry as you please. A sprinkle of snow had fallen while they had been on the train, and there was a jolly feeling of winter in the air. Ahead of them, on the hill, the windows of the school buildings twinkled a welcome to them. \n \n [64] \n \n “Getting back isn’t so bad, after all, is it?” asked Dan. And Gerald agreed that it wasn’t. \n \n They hurried to the Office to register their return, and then scampered up the stairs of Clarke. And when Dan had lighted the drop-light on the study table and the familiar objects in the room met their gaze, why, it was quite like getting home! \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2035/57922.html","bookId":615,"book":{"id":615,"title":"Double Play","description":"简介： Dan Vinton returned to Yardley after the Christmas vacation on an afternoon of one of those bright, warm days which sometimes happen along in the middle of Winter.
