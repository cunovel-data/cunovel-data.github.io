{"id":3393,"no":17,"title":"8. TO TRANTOR","content":"Devers bent over the little dead globe, watching for a tiny sign of life. The directional control was slowly and thoroughly sieving space with its jabbing tight sheaf of signals. Barr watched patiently from his seat on the low cot in the comer, He asked, \"No more signs of them?\" \"The Empire boys? No.\" The trader growled the words with evident impatience. \"We lost the scuppers long ago. Space! With the blind jumps we took through hyperspace, it\u0027s lucky we didn\u0027t land up in a sun\u0027s belly. They couldn\u0027t have followed us even if they outranged us, which they didn\u0027t.\" He sat back and loosened his collar with a jerk. \"I don\u0027t know what those Empire boys have done here. I think some of the gaps are out of alignment.\" \"I take it, then, you\u0027re trying to get to the Foundation.\" \"I\u0027m calling the Association ?or trying to.\" \"The Association? Who are they?\" \"Association of Independent Traders. Never heard of it, huh? Well, you\u0027re not alone. We haven\u0027t made our splash yet!\" For a while there was a silence that centered about the unresponsive Reception Indicator, and Barr said, \"Are you within range?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I haven\u0027t but a small notion where we are, going by dead reckoning. That\u0027s why I have to use directional control. It could take years, you know.\" \"Might it?\" Barr pointed; and Devers jumped and adjusted his earphones. Within the little murky sphere there was a tiny glowing whiteness. For half an hour, Devers nursed the fragile, groping thread of communication that reached through hyperspace to connect two points that laggard light would take five hundred years to bind together. Then he sat back, hopelessly. He looked up, and shoved the earphones back. \"Let\u0027s eat, doc. There\u0027s a needle-shower you can use if you want to, but go easy on the hot water.\" He squatted before one of the cabinets that lined one wall and felt through the contents. \"You\u0027re not a vegetarian, I hope?\" Barr said, \"I\u0027m omnivorous. But what about the Association. Have you lost them?\" \"Looks so. It was extreme range, a little too extreme. Doesn\u0027t matter, though. I got all that counted.\" He straightened, and placed the two metal containers upon the table. \"Just give it five minutes, doc, then slit it open by pushing the contact. It\u0027ll be plate, food, and fork ?sort of handy for when you\u0027re in a hurry, if you\u0027re not interested in such incidentals as napkins. I suppose you want to know what I got out of the Association.\" \"If it isn\u0027t a secret.\" Devers shook his head. \"Not to you. What Riose said was true.\" \"About the offer of tribute?\" \"Uh-huh. They offered it, and had it refused. Things are bad. There\u0027s fighting in the outer suns of Loris.\" \"Loris is close to the Foundation?\" \"Huh? Oh, you wouldn\u0027t know. It\u0027s one of the original Four Kingdoms. You might call it part of the inner line of defense. That\u0027s not the worst. They\u0027ve been fighting large ships previously never encountered. Which means Riose wasn\u0027t giving us the works. He has received more ships. Brodrig has switched sides, and I have messed things up.\" His eyes were bleak as he joined the food-container contact-points and watched it fall open neatly. The stewlike dish steamed its aroma through the room. Ducem Barr was already eating. \"So much,\" said Barr, \"for improvisations, then. We can do nothing here; we can not cut through the Imperial lines to return to the Foundation; we can do nothing but that which is most sensible ?to wait patiently. However, if Riose has reached the inner line I trust the wait will not be too long.\" And Devers put down his fork. \"Wait, is it?\" he snarled, glowering. \"That\u0027s all right for you. You\u0027ve got nothing at stake.\" \"Haven\u0027t I?\" Barr smiled thinly. \"No. In fact, I\u0027ll tell you.\" Devers\u0027 irritation skimmed the surface. \"I\u0027m tired of looking at this whole business as if it were an interesting something-or-other on a microscope slide. I\u0027ve got friends somewhere out there, dying; and a whole world out there, my home, dying also. You\u0027re an outsider. You don\u0027t know.\" \"I have seen friends die.\" The old man\u0027s hands were limp in his lap and his eyes were closed. \"Are you married?\" Devers said, \"Traders don\u0027t marry.\" \"Well, I have two sons and a nephew. They have been warned, but ?for reasons ?they could take no action. Our escape means their death. My daughter and my two grandchildren have, I hope, left the planet safety before this, but even excluding them, I have already risked and lost more than you.\" Devers was morosely savage. \"I know. But that was a matter of choice. You might have played ball with Riose. I never asked you to? Barr shook his head. \"It was not a matter of choice, Devers. Make your conscience free, I didn\u0027t risk my sons for you. I co-operated with Riose as long as I dared. But there was the Psychic Probe.\" The Siwennian patrician opened his eyes and they were sharp with pain. \"Riose came to me once; it was over a year ago. He spoke of a cult centering about the magicians, but missed the truth. It is not quite a cult. You see, it is forty years now that Siwenna has been gripped in the same unbearable vise that threatens your world. Five revolts have been ground out. Then I discovered the ancient records of Hari Seldon ?and now this \u0027cult\u0027 waits. \"It waits for the coming of the \u0027magicians\u0027 and for that day it is ready. My sons are leaders of those who wait. It is that secret which is in my mind and which the Probe must never touch. And so they must die as hostages; for the alternative is their death as rebels and half of Siwenna with them. You see, I had no choice! And I am no outsider.\" Devers\u0027 eyes fell, and Barr continued softly, \"It is on a Foundation victory that Siwenna\u0027s hopes depend. It is for a Foundation victory that my sons are sacrificed. And Hari Seldon does not pre-calculate the inevitable salvation of Siwenna as he does that of the Foundation. I have no certainty for my people ?only hope.\" \"But you are still satisfied to wait. Even with the Imperial Navy at Loris.\" \"I would wait, in perfect confidence,\" said Barr, simply, \"if they had landed on the planet, Terminus, itself.\" The trader frowned hopelessly. \"I don\u0027t know. It can\u0027t really work like that; not just like magic. Psychohistory or not, they\u0027re terribly strong, and we\u0027re weak. What can Setdon do about it?\" \"There\u0027s nothing to do. It\u0027s all already done. It\u0027s proceeding now. Because you don\u0027t hear the wheels turning and the gongs beating doesn\u0027t mean it\u0027s any the less certain.\" \"Maybe; but I wish you had cracked Riose\u0027s skull for keeps. He\u0027s more the enemy than all his army.\" \"Cracked his skull? With Brodrig his second in command?\" Barr\u0027s face sharpened with hate. \"All Siwenna would have been my hostage. Brodrig has proven his worth long since. There exists a world which five years ago lost one male in every ten ?and simply for failure to meet outstanding taxes. This same Brodrig was the tax-collector. No, Riose may live. His punishments are mercy in comparison.\" \"But six months, six months, in the enemy Base, with nothing to show for it.\" Devers\u0027 strong hands clasped each other tautly, so that his knuckles cracked. \"Nothing to show for it!\" \"Well, now, wait. You remind me? Barr fumbled in his pouch. \"You might want to count this.\" And he tossed the small sphere of metal on the table. Devers snatched it. \"What is it?\" \"The message capsule. The one that Riose received just before I jacked him. Does that count as something?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Depends on what\u0027s in it!\" Devers sat down and turned it over carefully in his hand. When Barr stepped from his cold shower and, gratefully, into the mild warm current of the air dryer, he found Devers silent and absorbed at the workbench. The Siwennian slapped his body with a sharp rhythm and spoke above the punctuating sounds. \"What are you doing?\" Devers looked up. Droplets of perspiration glittered in his beard. \"I\u0027m going to open this capsule.\" \"Can you open it without Riose\u0027s personal characteristic?\" There was mild surprise in the Siwennian\u0027s voice. \"If I can\u0027t, I\u0027ll resign from the Association and never skipper a ship for what\u0027s left of my life. I\u0027ve got a three-way electronic analysis of the interior now, and I\u0027ve got little jiggers that the Empire never heard of, especially made for jimmying capsules. I\u0027ve been a burglar before this, y\u0027know. A trader has to be something of everything.\" He bent low over the little sphere, and a small flat instrument probed delicately and sparked redly at each fleeting contact. He said, \"This capsule is a crude job, anyway. These Imperial boys are no shakes at this small work. I can see that. Ever see a Foundation capsule? It\u0027s half the size and impervious to electronic analysis in the first place.\" And then he was rigid, the shoulder muscles beneath his tunic tautening visibly. His tiny probe pressed slowly? It was noiseless when it came, but Devers; relaxed and sighed. In his hand was the shining sphere with its message unrolled like a parchment tongue. \"It\u0027s from Brodrig,\" he said. Then, with contempt, \"The message medium is permanent. In a Foundation capsule, the message would be oxidized to gas within the minute.\" But Ducem Barr waved him silent. He read the message quickly. FROM: AMMEL BRODRIG, ENVOY EXTRAORDINARY OF HIS IMPERIAL MAJESTY, PRIVY SECRETARY OF THE COUNCIL, AND PEER OF THE REALM. TO: BEL RIOSE, MILITARY GOVERNOR OF SIWENNA. GENERAL OF THE IMPERIAL FORCES, AND PEER OF THE REALM. I GREET YOU. PLANET #1120 NO LONGER RESISTS. THE PLANS OF OFFENSE AS OUTLINED CONTINUE SMOOTHLY. THE ENEMY WEAKENS VISIBLY AND THE ULTIMATE ENDS IN VIEW WILL SURELY BE GAINED. Barr raised his head from the almost microscopic print and cried bitterly, \"The fool! The forsaken blasted fop! That a message?\" \"Huh?\" said Devers. He was vaguely disappointed. \"It says nothing,\" ground out Barr. \"Our lick-spittle courtier is playing at general now. With Riose away, he is the field commander and must sooth his paltry spirit by spewing out his pompous reports concerning military affairs he has nothing to do with. \u0027So-and-so planet no longer resists.\u0027 \u0027The offensive moves on.\u0027 \u0027The enemy weakens.\u0027 The vacuum-headed peacock.\" \"Well, now, wait a minute. Hold on? \"Throw it away.\" The old man turned away in mortification. \"The Galaxy knows I never expected it to be world-shakingly important, but in wartime it is reasonable to assume that even the most routine order left undelivered might hamper military movements and lead to complications later. It\u0027s why I snatched it. But this! Better to have left it. It would have wasted a minute of Riose\u0027s time that will now be put to more constructive use.\" But Devers had arisen. \"Will you hold on and stop throwing your weight around? For Seldon\u0027s sake? He held out the sliver of message before Barr\u0027s nose, \"Now read that again. What does he mean by \u0027ultimate ends in view\u0027?\" \"The conquest of the Foundation. Well?\" \"Yes? And maybe he means the conquest of the Empire. You know he believes that to be the ultimate end.\" \"And if he does?\" \"If he does!\" Devers\u0027 one-sided smile was lost in his beard. \"Why, watch then, and I\u0027ll show you.\" With one finger the lavishly monogrammed sheet of message-parchment was thrust back into its slot. With a soft twang, it disappeared and the globe was a smooth, unbroken whole again. Somewhere inside was the tiny oiled whir of the controls as they lost their setting by random movements. \"Now there is no known way of opening this capsule without knowledge of Riose\u0027s personal characteristic, is there?\" \"To the Empire, no,\" said Barr. \"Then the evidence it contains is unknown to us and absolutely authentic.\" \"To the Empire, yes,\" said Barr. \"And the Emperor can open it, can\u0027t he? Personal Characteristics of Government officials must be on file. We keep records of our officials at the Foundation.\" \"At the Imperial capital as well,\" agreed Barr. \"Then when you, a Siwennian patrician and Peer of the Realm, tell this Cleon, this Emperor, that his favorite tame-parrot and his shiniest general are getting together to knock him over, and hand him the capsule as evidence, what will he think Brodrig\u0027s \u0027ultimate ends\u0027 are?\" Barr sat down weakly. \"Wait, I don\u0027t follow you.\" He stroked one thin cheek, and said, \"You\u0027re not really serious, are you?\" \"I am.\" Devers was angrily excited. \"Listen, nine out of the last ten Emperors got their throats cut, or their gizzards blasted out by one or another of their generals with bigtime notions in their heads. You told me that yourself more than once. Old man Emperor would believe us so fast it would make Riose\u0027s head swim.\" Barr muttered feebly, \"He is serious, For the Galaxy\u0027s sake, man, you can\u0027t beat a Seldon crisis by a far-fetched, impractical, storybook scheme like that. Suppose you had never got hold of the capsule. Suppose Brodrig hadn\u0027t used the word \u0027ultimate.\u0027 Seldon doesn\u0027t depend on wild luck.\" \"If wild luck comes our way, there\u0027s no law says Seldon can\u0027t take advantage of it.\" \"Certainly. But ... but,\" Barr stopped, then spoke calmly but with visible restraint. \"Look, in the first place, how will you get to the planet Trantor? You don\u0027t know its location in space, and I certainly don\u0027t remember the co-ordinates, to say nothing of the ephemerae. You don\u0027t even know your own position in space.\" \"You can\u0027t get lost in space,\" grinned Devers. He was at the controls already. \"Down we go to the nearest planet, and back we come with complete bearings and the best navigation charts Brodrig\u0027s hundred thousand smackers can buy.\" \"And a blaster in our belly. Our descriptions are probably in every planet in this quarter of the Empire.\" \"Doc,\" said Devers, patiently, \"don\u0027t be a hick tom the sticks. Riose said my ship surrendered too easily and, brother, he wasn\u0027t kidding. This ship has enough fire-power and enough juice in its shield to hold off anything we\u0027re Rely to meet this deep inside the frontier. And we have personal shields, too. The Empire boys never found them, you know, but they weren\u0027t meant to be found.\" \"All fight,\" said Barr, \"all right. Suppose yourself on Trantor. How do you see the Emperor then? You think he keeps office hours?\" \"Suppose we worry about that on Trantor,\" said Devers. And Barr muttered helplessly, \"All right again. I\u0027ve wanted to see Trantor before I die for half a century now. Have your way.\" The hypernuclear motor was cut in. The lights flickered and there was the slight internal wrench that marked the shift into hyperspace.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1593/47357.html","bookId":126,"book":{"id":126,"title":"基地系列 Foundation and Empire 基地与帝国","description":"简介： 《基地与帝国》（Foundation and Empire），是美国作家艾萨克阿西莫夫出版于1952年的科幻小说中篇集，基地三部曲的第二部（后来发展成基地系列）。本书讲述了基地经过近200年的励精图治，称霸银河外缘之后，终于与银河帝国产生正面冲突，并遭受突变异种骡的打击的故事，...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201607/04/10-32-56-88-1.jpg","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/1593","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
