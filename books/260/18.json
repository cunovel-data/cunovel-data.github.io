{"id":7853,"no":18,"title":"Chapter XVIII — The Envelope","content":"\"What train?\" asked the gentleman. \"The five-o\u0027clock train to Milltown.\" \"Is that the last train?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"You will have to wait till to-morrow. Will it make much difference?\" Ben blushed. \"I shall have to stay at a hotel,\" he said uncomfortably, \"and I don\u0027t think I have money enough. I did not expect to have that expense.\" \"I can relieve you on that score,\" said the gentleman. \"I live in Charleston, not far away. You shall stay at my house to-night, and go home by the morning train. There is a morning train, isn\u0027t there?\" \"Yes, sir, at half-past ten.\" \"You will accept my invitation?\" \"Yes, sir, and thank you,\" said Ben gratefully. \"I don\u0027t know what I should have done if you had not invited me.\" \"I am glad to have the opportunity of doing you a kindness. I want to send you away with a good impression of Charleston.\" It was a handsome house to which Ben was led by his new friend. His wife received the two children with unaffected kindness, and soon made them feel at home. During the evening Mr. Somerby, for this was his name, drew out of Ben the particulars of his history and present position. Ben seemed so frank and manly that he was quite pleased with him. Mr. Somerby was not in business, unless he may be called a capitalist. He was the possessor of a large fortune, and the care of his property required a considerable share of his time. When Ben was ready to go the next morning, Mr. Somerby put an envelope into his hand. \"Don\u0027t open this till you get home,\" he said. \"No, sir.\" \"Now, good-by, and good luck to you.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" Meanwhile Mrs. Bradford at home was feeling anxious. Old Mrs. Perkins had dropped in to make a call, and her conversation wasn\u0027t reassuring. \"Hasn\u0027t Ben got back?\" she asked. \"Not yet.\" \"There\u0027s a great risk in sendin\u0027 a boy so fur,\" said the old lady. \"Do you think so?\" asked Mrs. Bradford uneasily. \"To be sure I do. He\u0027s too young.\" \"That\u0027s what I thought; but Ben was very sure he could get along.\" \"Boys is allus confident,\" said Mrs. Perkins, whose knowledge of grammar was not very profound; \"but I never knew one that you could rely on.\" \"Benjamin is a good boy.\" \"Yes, he\u0027s a good boy as boys go; but don\u0027t you trust him too fur. When did you expect him back?\" \"I expected him last night.\" \"And he didn\u0027t come? Just as I thought.\" Mrs. Perkins nodded her head vigorously, and looked unutterably wise. \"Maybe the cars is gone off the track,\" said the old lady. \"Oh, don\u0027t say such things, Mrs. Perkins,\" said Mrs. Bradford uneasily. \"I didn\u0027t say they had, but we\u0027re havin\u0027 a dreffle number of accidents nowadays.\" \"Ben is all right,\" said Tony, thinking he ought to defend his cousin. \"He said when he went away, he\u0027d come home right side up with care.\" \"Little boys should be seen and not heard,\" said Mrs. Perkins. \"\u0027Always be prepared for the worst.\u0027 That\u0027s my motto.\" \"And my motto is \u0027Wait and Hope!\u0027\" said a familiar voice outside the door. \"It\u0027s Ben!\" exclaimed Tony joyfully. The door was thrown open and there stood Ben, with little Emma\u0027s hand in his. \"Aunt Jane,\" he said, \"here\u0027s little Emma, come to live with you.\" \"My dear, I am very glad to see you,\" said Mrs. Bradford. Emma looked in her gentle face, and liked her at once. \"Will you be my aunt, too?\" she asked. \"Yes, my dear.\" \"Tony, come here and be introduced,\" said Ben. Tony was bashful at first, but it was not very long before he and Emma were merrily playing together. \"So you\u0027re railly back, Benjamin?\" said old Mrs. Perkins, rather disappointed. \"Yes, ma\u0027am. How\u0027s James?\" \"Loafin\u0027 round, as usual,\" said his affectionate relative. \"Boys are so shiftless.\" \"They may be,\" admitted Ben good-naturedly, \"but they get hungry sometimes. Aunt Jane, is there anything to eat in the house?\" \"I will set the table at once,\" said his aunt. \"The little girl must be hungry, too.\" \"You\u0027re undertakin\u0027 a great responsibility, Mrs. Bradford,\" said Mrs. Perkins. \"The little girl will be a great care to you.\" \"I don\u0027t look upon it in that light,\" said Mrs. Bradford. \"I am glad to have her here.\" \"Humph! You will talk different a month from now. But I must be goin\u0027.\" After dinner Ben bethought himself of the envelope which Mr. Somerby had given him. He opened it, when a bank-note dropped to the floor. Picking it up, he saw, to his amazement, that it was a fifty-dollar bill. With sparkling eyes he read the letter, or rather these few lines which were penciled on a half-sheet of note paper: \"I have been interested in your story, and beg your acceptance of the enclosed as a slight help and encouragement. Should you ever need advice or assistance, I shall be glad to have you call upon me.\" \"Frederic Somerby\" \"What do you think of that, Aunt Jane?\" said Ben in a tone of exultation. \"Hasn\u0027t my motto worked pretty well, after all? Isn\u0027t it better to \u0027Wait and Hope\u0027 than to give up and get discouraged?\" \"Yes, Ben, I begin to think you are right.\" \"We are better off than when I was at work in the factory.\" \"Yes, Ben; we can get along very comfortably.\" \"I have been thinking, aunt, that while business continues dull I will go to school. This money I will put in a savings-bank, and we shall have it to fall back upon if we need it.\" This plan met with Mrs. Bradford\u0027s approval, and was carried out by Ben. When he returned from the savings-bank, with his book in his hand, he felt like a capitalist. In fact, he was so cheerful that his aunt caught the infection, and looked brighter than she had for years. \"It is pleasant to have money in the bank,\" she said to old Mrs. Perkins. \"Like as not the bank will break,\" said the old lady. \"I see an account last week of a savin\u0027s-bank that failed. I wouldn\u0027t trust any of \u0027em.\" \"Mrs. Perkins,\" said Ben, with mock gravity, \"I heard last week of a man who died in his bed. I\u0027d never go to bed if I were you.\" \"It aint\u0027 well to joke,\" said the old lady. \"Always be prepared for the worst.\" \"That isn\u0027t my motto,\" said Ben. \"As long as I live I mean to \u0027Wait and Hope\u0027!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83555.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
