{"id":7870,"no":35,"title":"Chapter XXXV — John Tremlett","content":"John Tremlett was a dark-complexioned young man, rather above the middle height. He was by no means handsome; but plain faces are often attractive, and this young man\u0027s was not. His eyes were bloodshot, and even Ben\u0027s inexperienced glance could detect the marks of dissipation. He was expensively dressed and looked like one who made a business of spending money. \"How are you, Brief?\" he said carelessly, throwing himself into a chair. \"In better condition than you are, I judge from your looks, Mr. Tremlett,\" responded the lawyer. \"I hope so. I feel awfully seedy,\" said Tremlett. \"Your own fault. You shouldn\u0027t keep such late hours.\" \"Oh, bother that, Brief! I must have a good time.\" \"You don\u0027t look as if you were enjoying your mode of life.\" \"Oh, I shall be all right when I get over my headache. Is this a client of yours?\" glancing at Ben. \"He\u0027s a relation of yours, according to his own account,\" said Mr. Brief. \"Is he?\" inquired Tremlett languidly. \"Can\u0027t say I ever saw him before.\" \"Mr. Baldwin was my great-uncle,\" said Ben. \"That is, he was an uncle of my aunt, Mrs. Jane Bradford.\" \"Indeed! Were you expecting a share of the property?\" asked Tremlett suspiciously. \"I thought Mr. Baldwin might remember his niece.\" \"He hasn\u0027t, though.\" \"So I find by the will.\" \"Sorry for you; but, of course, Mr. Baldwin had a right to dispose of his property as he saw fit.\" \"I don\u0027t deny his right.\" \"Then you are not intending to dispute the will,\" said Tremlett, relieved. \"I never dreamed of doing it. I came about a house which my aunt has been occupying rent-free.\" \"What is it, Brief? Do I know about it?\" \"It\u0027s a small house in Milltown, Massachusetts, which belongs to your uncle\u0027s estate. I found that Mrs. Bradford has paid no rent for it during the last five years, and accordingly sent her an invitation to pay up arrears.\" \"Has she done it?\" \"No, sir,\" said Ben. \"Mr. Baldwin permitted her to occupy the house rent-free.\" \"That is your assertion,\" said the lawyer. \"It is true,\" returned Ben quickly. \"Show it to me in writing, and that will end all dispute.\" \"I hope yet to do it, but thus far we have been unable to find Uncle Matthew\u0027s letter.\" \"That\u0027s all fair,\" said Tremlett. If the letter can\u0027t be found, the money must be paid. \"My aunt is utterly unable to pay it. She is poor.\" \"That is no excuse in law, my young friend,\" said Mr. Brief. \"She must borrow the money then.\" \"Where?\" asked Ben. \"That is not our lookout. As you are in business, perhaps you will advance the necessary sum.\" \"If I were able, and were satisfied of the justice of the claim, I would do so,\" answered Ben. \"But I don\u0027t believe that Uncle Matthew intended that my aunt should be distressed by such a demand. Why should he have let the rent run on for five years if he expected her to pay it?\" \"Can\u0027t say, I\u0027m sure.\" \"How much is due?\" asked Tremlett. \"Three hundred dollars,\" said Brief. \"Look here, young fellow,\" said Tremett, \"Perhaps you and I can settle it. If you will pay me two hundred dollars cash down I will give you a receipt for the whole.\" \"Mr. Tremlett,\" said Mr. Brief stiffly, \"you appear to forget that I am settling this estate. You have no authority to make such an offer.\" \"Wasn\u0027t the property left to me, I should like to know?\" demanded Tremlett, blustering. \"Yes.\" \"Then why am I not authorized to make the offer, tell me that?\" \"According to Mr. Baldwin\u0027s will you can only receive the income for the first twelve months.\" \"That\u0027s deuced hard on a fellow,\" said Tremlett. \"On the other hand, I think it is a prudent precaution.\" \"The old man was a tight-fisted old curmudgeon. He only wanted to annoy me.\" The lawyer shrugged his shoulders, and Ben broke out indignantly, \"I wouldn\u0027t speak in that way of a man who had left me all his fortune.\" \"Mind your own business, boy,\" retorted John Tremlett sharply. \"Do you think I am going to stand your impudence?\" \"I think it is just as well you have waited till after Uncle Matthew\u0027s death before speaking of him in that way.\" \"Don\u0027t let up on the boy! Make him pay every cent of the debt, Brief!\" exclaimed John Tremlett angrily. \"Of course we shall follow up the matter, Mr. Tremlett.\" \"Have him arrested if he doesn\u0027t pay, Brief.\" Ben smiled. \"You seem to forget, Mr. Tremlett, that I am not your debtor. The claim is against my aunt.\" \"Is that so, Brief?\" \"The boy is right.\" \"I am sorry for it. I should like to hold him responsible.\" \"No doubt, Mr. Tremlett,\" said Ben; \"but we can\u0027t always have our wishes granted.\" \"Leave the matter in my hands,\" said the lawyer. \"I will do what is best.\" \"By the way, Brief,\" said John Tremlett, \"I mustn\u0027t forget my errand. I want some money.\" \"Some money? I gave you two hundred dollars last week.\" \"Well, it\u0027s gone, and I want some more.\" \"Mr. Tremlett,\" said the lawyer gravely, \"are you aware how much money you have spent during the last four weeks?\" \"No, I have kept no account.\" \"Well I have. You have drawn eight hundred dollars.\" \"It costs something to see life.\" \"Perhaps so! but I cannot permit you to exceed your income—during the first year, at least. Thus far you have spent twice as much as you were entitled to draw.\" Ben listened attentively. He had no idea of the extent of his uncle\u0027s property. If it yielded four hundred dollars a month, as he inferred, it must amount to nearly, if not quite, a hundred thousand dollars. And this young man was not content with that. Our hero could not help wondering at his unreasonableness. \"I don\u0027t see how I can economize,\" muttered Tremlett. \"What was your income before Mr. Baldwin\u0027s death, Mr. Tremlett?\" inquired Mr. Brief. \"I starved on eight hundred dollars a year.\" \"Then it seems to me you aught to live comfortably now on five thousand.\" \"My circumstances are changed.\" \"At this rate you\u0027ll run through the property in ten years.\" \"Oh, I\u0027ll pull up after awhile,\" said the heir carelessly. \"So just give me a couple of hundreds, old fellow!\" \"I will hand you a hundred,\" said Mr. Brief reluctantly. \"Hereafter you must keep within your allowance.\" \"You\u0027re getting to be as miserly as the old man,\" said Tremlett. \"What\u0027s your name, boy?\" \"My name is Benjamin Bradford.\" \"I suppose we are cousins, or something of that sort. Come out and take a drink.\" \"No, thank you. I never drink.\" \"You don\u0027t? What a prig you must be! Good-bye, Brief.\" The heir left the office, and Mr. Brief turned to Ben. \"What do you think of your uncle\u0027s heir?\" he inquired. \"I think he is going to ruin rapidly,\" answered Ben. \"You are right. The grub has become a butterfly, and the sober clerk has developed into a gay spendthrift. He was your uncle\u0027s clerk and distant relative. It would make the old man turn in his coffin if he knew how quickly his money is likely to melt away.\" \"Can\u0027t you check him?\" asked Ben. \"For twelve months I can. After that I am powerless. I wish he were more like you.\" \"Thank you,\" said Ben, surprised at the compliment. \"My bark is worse that my bite,\" said the lawyer. \"About this claim against your aunt I will do what I can for you, but try to find the letter you refer to. The sum is a small one.\" \"It is large to us.\" \"Just so; but my client would squander it in a week. Let me hear from you after you have returned and instituted a further search.\" \"Thank you, sir, I will write.\" Ben left the office, judging Mr. Brief more favorably than at first. With John Tremlett, he was disgusted.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83572.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
