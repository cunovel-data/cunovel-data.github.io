{"id":7865,"no":30,"title":"Chapter XXX — Sam Is Improved By Adversity","content":"Mr. Archer\u0027s flight made a great commotion in Milltown. No one entertained a suspicion of his integrity. He had been appropriating the funds of the corporation to his own use, being treasurer as well as superintendent. When exposure was inevitable he fled. To Sam and his mother, it was a great blow, not only on account of the disgrace, but also because it involved poverty and a narrow style of living. To persons of their pretensions this was heavy to bear. They were not altogether penniless. Mrs. Archer had property of her own, to the amount of four thousand dollars, which was unimpaired. But, even at a liberal rate of interest, this would not support them. Sam remained in the house, dispirited and resentful against the father who had brought this upon him, till he got tired of confinement and walked out. He hoped to meet no one whom he knew, but at the corner of the street he fell in with James Watson. \"He is one of Ben Bradford\u0027s friends. He will rejoice at what has happened,\" thought Sam. But James stopped him, and said in a friendly tone: \"Are you out for a walk, Sam? Let us walk together?\" \"I didn\u0027t know as you\u0027d care to walk with me.\" \"You don\u0027t think I rejoice over your misfortune?\" \"I didn\u0027t know but you might. You are a friend of Ben Bradford.\" \"He will be very sorry. He won\u0027t think of any little difference there has been between you.\" \"I don\u0027t believe that,\" said Sam, shaking his head. \"You will, as soon as you see him. You mustn\u0027t lose courage, Sam. I know it\u0027s bad for you, but——\" \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to become of us,\" said Sam despondently. \"We shall be poor.\" \"That isn\u0027t the worst thing that can happen to you.\" \"Father has treated us very badly.\" \"He has done wrong; but he is your father. Remember, Sam, I am your friend, and if I can do anything for you I will.\" \"Thank you, James,\" he said. \"You are a good fellow—much better than I thought. I supposed you would be glad I was down in the world.\" Same was to be still more surprised. The next day he received the following letter from Ben Bradford: \"Dear Sam: I am very sorry to hear of your misfortune. Of course, no one can blame you or your mother. I believe I was the last acquaintance to see your father before he left Boston. I had occasion to go on board the Cunard steamer which sailed on Wednesday. On the dock I met your father, and had a little conversation with him. He did not tell me that he was going to Europe; but he was in a traveling-dress and, no doubt, he was. \"What has happened will, no doubt, make some difference in your plans. If you wish to get a situation in Boston, I may be able to help you to one. At the beginning of next month there will be an opening for a boy in an establishment on Milk Street. The wages will not exceed five dollars a week; but it would be difficult for a beginner to do better. If you wish, I will try to get this place for you. At any rate, I hope you will regard me as a friend who wishes you well. The little quarrel there has been between us is not worth remembering. \"Your sincere friend, \"Benjamin Bradford.\" To say that Sam was surprised to receive this cordial letter from a boy whom he had so persistently tried to injure will hardly express his feelings. He was overwhelmed with astonishment, mingled with shame. \"Ben is a great deal better than I am,\" he was forced to admit. \"I don\u0027t deserve such a kindness from him.\" He showed Ben\u0027s letter to his mother. \"I think I had better ask Ben to get me the place. We must not be too proud.\" \"We have no right to be proud now. We shall have scarcely enough to support us in the humblest manner.\" \"My wages will help. I shall get five dollars a week. That will be two hundred and sixty dollars a year.\" Even Mrs. Archer was surprised at the change in Sam. \"Do you think you will be willing to work?\" \"Of course I shall; that is, if I can work in Boston. I don\u0027t want to stay here.\" \"Nor I,\" said Mrs. Archer. \"Suppose we both go to Boston, then.\" \"I am afraid our income won\u0027t be sufficient.\" \"For two or three years you can spend some of your principal, mother. By that time I shall be getting higher wages, and it may not be necessary.\" \"I didn\u0027t expect that you would take it so, Sam.\" Ben received the following answer to his letter. \"Dear Ben: I thank you for your kind letter. I feel very much ashamed of the way I have treated you in the past. I didn\u0027t know what a good fellow you were. I am afraid I shouldn\u0027t have behaved as well in your place. As to your offer, I accept it thankfully. I shall be very glad to get the place you speak of. Mother and I intend to move to Boston, as it is no longer agreeable to stay here. Do you know of any boarding-house where the prices are reasonable, for we cannot afford to pay high rates? If you do, please find out on what terms we can be accommodated, and let me know.\" Ben was pleased. \"Sam has improved,\" he thought. By the first of the month Sam and his mother were established in a boarding-house on Warren Avenue and Sam had entered upon his duties in Milk Street. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83567.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
