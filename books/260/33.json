{"id":7868,"no":33,"title":"Chapter XXXIII — Ben Receives a Commission","content":"In due time a letter came from Montreal. It was brief and not overcourteous. From it Ben learned that Mr. Baldwin had been dead for three weeks, and that all his property was left to a young man who claimed to be a distant relative. The name of the heir was John Tremlett. The letter concluded: \"I can find nothing in the papers of the deceased confirming your statement that your aunt was allowed to occupy her house rent free. If you hold any proof of your assertions, you may forward it. Otherwise Mr. Tremlett will insist upon his claim.\" This letter reached Ben on a Friday. It naturally caused him anxiety. He obtained permission to go to Milltown Saturday afternoon and spend Sunday. He desired himself to institute a search for the letter of which his aunt had spoken. His aunt received him in tearful despondency. \"Oh, what shall we do, Benjamin?\" said the widow. \"First, we must search for that letter of Uncle Matthew\u0027s.\" \"I know I\u0027m to blame, Benjamin. I have brought ruin upon you and my poor, innocent Tony.\" \"You haven\u0027t ruined me, so you need not trouble yourself about that. Even if the letter cannot be found, I guess we shall live through it.\" They hunted high and low; but the letter was not to be found. Ben was a good deal disappointed, but did not venture to say so, not wishing to increase his aunt\u0027s despondency. On Monday morning he went back to Boston, and told the bookkeeper. \"It seems quite desirable that you should go to Montreal, Ben,\" said young Porter. \"Of course that is out of the question, Mr. Porter.\" \"No; I think it can be managed.\" Ben looked, as he felt, not a little surprised. \"It is some time,\" explained the bookkeeper, \"since we sent an agent to Montreal. We have been thinking of sending some one up there, stopping at the principal towns on the way. You are rather young, but if I recommend you I presume my uncle will let you go.\" Of course Mr. Porter, senior, had to be consulted. Though not a little doubtful about the expediency of sending so young a representative of the house, he finally gave his consent, which was communicated to Ben. Ben was summoned to the countingroom, and received his instructions, with a sum of money for expenses. At three o\u0027clock in the afternoon he was dismissed, though he was not to start till the next morning. Old Mr. Benton\u0027s door was open when Ben returned. \"What brings you home so soon?\" he inquired. \"I am going to Montreal,\" said Ben. \"Come in and tell me about it.\" The old man, clad in a ragged dressing-gown, was sitting in a rocking-chair by the fire. The day was not cold, but his blood was thin, and he felt the need of some artificial heat. He was smoking a common clay pipe. \"Isn\u0027t this sudden—your going to Montreal?\" asked Mr. Benton. \"Yes, sir; I think young Mr. Porter has made business there in order to give a chance to go?\" \"What do you mean to do?\" \"I shall attend first to the business of the firm, and then call on this lawyer, Mr. Brief.\" \"It is well thought of, and, Benjamin, try to get a chance to see the new heir, Mr. Tremlett, and find out what use he is making of his property.\" \"Yes, sir, I will.\" \"Have you money enough to pay your expenses, Benjamin?\" asked the old man, rather hesitatingly. \"Oh, yes, sir; the firm provides for that.\" \"To be sure. Of course they ought to do it,\" said Mr. Benton, appearing to feel relieved. \"How long do you expect to be gone, Benjamin?\" \"I don\u0027t know, sir; I am to stop in Burlington and one or two other places. I may be gone ten days.\" \"I shall feel lonely without you, Benjamin.\" \"I am glad you value my society so much.\" \"I am a lonely man, Benjamin; I have never had many friends, and I have outlived nearly all of those.\" \"You ought to have married, Mr. Benton; then you would have children and grandchildren to comfort you in your old age.\" \"I wish I had, Benjamin; but it is too late now.\" \"It is never too late to mend, Mr. Benton,\" said Ben. \"Men older than you have married.\" \"Then they were fools,\" said Mr. Benton bluntly. \"Suppose you should be sick, sir?\" \"I would hire a nurse. I am not rich, but I have enough to provide for the few years I have remaining.\" \"I must ask you to excuse me now, sir,\" said Ben. \"I must buy a few things which I shall need.\" Ben wrote briefly to his aunt, to let her know that he was about to start for Montreal. Mrs. Bradford was not a little discomposed. \"It\u0027s tempting Providence to send a child like Benjamin to a foreign country,\" she remarked to Mrs. Perkins, who had dropped in for a neighborly chat. \"Do you know how far it is, Mrs. Perkins?\" \"About a thousand miles,\" answered her visitor, whose ideas about geography were rather misty. \"Suppose Ben should lose his way.\" \"Like as not he will,\" observed Mrs. Perkins. \"I shan\u0027t sleep a wink till Ben gets back. They ought to have sent somebody with him.\" \"Ben can get along,\" said Tony, who had implicit confidence in his big cousin. \"He won\u0027t get lost.\" \"What does a child like you know about it?\" said Mrs. Perkins rebukingly. \"You shouldn\u0027t put in your oar when your mother and me are talking.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83570.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
