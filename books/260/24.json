{"id":7859,"no":24,"title":"Chapter XXIV — Ben Arrives in Boston","content":"Ben set out for Boston on Monday morning in very good spirits. His aunt shed a few tears at parting. She was apt to take depressing views of the future, and said; \"I hope you\u0027ll prosper, Ben,\" in a tone which implied that she did not think there was more than one chance in ten of his success. But Ben understood his aunt, and did not allow her presentiments to weigh with him. His motto was still, \"Wait and Hope.\" Ben found himself seated beside a young man of pleasant appearance, who was attracted by our hero\u0027s frank and manly look. \"I suppose you are going to Boston,\" he said. \"Yes,\" answered Ben readily. \"Have you got a place there?\" \"I am going to have,\" said Ben cheerfully. \"Do you mind telling where?\" \"Oh, no,\" said Ben; \"I am going to the store of Jones \u0026 Porter.\" \"Indeed! There are very prominent business men.\" \"I suppose they are,\" said Ben. \"Do you know them personally?\" \"I don\u0027t know them at all. I think some friend of mine must have mentioned me to them.\" \"It\u0027s rather singular that I shouldn\u0027t know anything about your engagement,\" said the young man. \"Why should you?\" inquired Ben, in natural surprise. \"The fact is, I am Mr. Porter\u0027s nephew, and am a salesman in the establishment,\" said the young man. He drew from his pocket a business card, bearing the name. HENRY W. PORTER With Jones and Porter Ben was rather disturbed, and he thought: \"Can there be anything wrong?\" He said aloud: \"I don\u0027t see how there can be any mistake. I received a letter from Jones \u0026 Porter last week, offering me the place.\" Ben took the letter from his pocket and handed it to the young man. The latter ran his eye over it hastily. He examined the signature and the address, and said quietly \"I don\u0027t think this letter came from our store.\" Ben felt as if the earth had opened before him. \"I don\u0027t understand it,\" he said, his face very red. \"If the letter isn\u0027t genuine, who could have written it?\" \"It seems written in a schoolboy hand,\" said young Porter. \"Isn\u0027t it possible that some one may be playing a practical joke on you?\" \"It wouldn\u0027t be much of a joke to me,\" said Ben. \"I should call it a mean trick myself,\" said Porter; \"but can\u0027t you think of any one who may have written it?\" \"I\u0027ll bet it\u0027s Sam Archer.\" \"And who is Sam Archer?\" \"He is the meanest boy in Milltown,\" said Ben. \"Doesn\u0027t he like you? Isn\u0027t he one of your friends?\" \"No, he does all he can to injure me. But\"—here Ben examined the letter a second time—\"this isn\u0027t his handwriting.\" \"That proves nothing. He probably sent it to some confederate in Boston to copy and mail to you.\" \"Don\u0027t you think there is any chance of its being genuine?\" asked Ben. \"The chance is very slight; but it is well, of course, to make sure. I have been away to pass Sunday, and shall go to the store at once on my arrival. You can go with me. I will introduce you to my uncle.\" \"If it is a trick,\" said Ben uncomfortably, \"I shall be in an awkward fix.\" \"Whether it is a trick or not, you can count on my friendship,\" said young Porter kindly. \"Thank you,\" said Ben gratefully. About an hour later Ben and his new friend entered the large and handsome bookstore of Jones \u0026 Porter. Young Porter, as he walked through the store, received the greetings of his fellow clerks. \"Have you adopted a boy?\" asked one facetiously. \"Yes,\" said Porter, smiling. \"Where is my uncle?\" \"He is in the back office.\" \"All right! Come along, Ben.\" Henry Porter kept on his way till he reached the back part of the store, where a good-sized office was partitioned off. Mr. Porter was writing at a desk. \"Good morning, uncle,\" said Ben\u0027s companion. \"Good morning, Henry. Have a good time?\" \"Excellent, uncle. Let me introduce to your favorite notice Master Benjamin Bradford, of Milltown.\" Mr. Porter did not consider it beneath his dignity to be polite even to a boy. \"I am glad to see you, my young friend,\" he said, rising and offering his hand to Ben. \"Are you on a visit to the city?\" Poor Ben! His heart sank within him. Evidently Mr. Porter would not ask such a question of a boy whom he had engaged to work for him. The young man saw his embarrassment and answered for him. \"That\u0027s rather an odd question to ask you new clerk, uncle,\" he said. \"My new clerk, Henry? I don\u0027t understand you.\" \"Ben, show your letter.\" \"That is a forgery,\" said the uncle rather indignantly. Poor Ben! Manly as he was, he felt ready to cry. \"I am sorry,\" he said faltering. \"Have you any idea who wrote it?\" asked Mr. Porter. \"Yes,\" answered Ben. \"It\u0027s Sam Archer.\" \"In fun?\" \"No, in spite. He is always glad to injure me.\" \"What can be his motive?\" Ben explained his relations with Sam. \"Do you need the position?\" asked Mr. Porter. \"Yes, sir, I am poor, and can ill afford the money I have spent in coming to Boston. Sam knows this, and it is mean for him, a rich boy, to fool me so.\" Mr. Porter was a kind-hearted man. More than once he had kept on a clerk whom he did not need. \"Go into the store a minute, my boy,\" he said, \"while I speak with my nephew.\" Of course Ben obeyed. \"What do you think of this boy, Henry?\" \"I think very favorably of him. He seems honest and straightforward, and I think he is smart.\" \"I like his looks myself; I wish we had a vacancy.\" \"We shall have very soon.\" \"To whom do you refer?\" \"Frank Robinson is going to leave at the beginning of next month. His father thinks it will be better for him to go to school a year or two longer.\" \"So you would recommend hiring this boy?\" \"Yes, sir; I have so good an opinion of him that I am quite willing to guarantee him. If you will take him on immediately, I will myself pay his wages till the end of the month, when Robinson leaves.\" \"Bravo, Henry! That shows a kind heart. I won\u0027t accept that, but will give you leave to help him outside as much as you please.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83561.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
