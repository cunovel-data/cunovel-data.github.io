{"id":7856,"no":21,"title":"Chapter XXI — Ben Wins at School","content":"Every boy was in his seat the next morning at the opening of school. Though the choice lay between two only, there was a general interest felt in the result of the competition. Ben was the favorite, though Sam had a few followers—generally sycophantic boys who had a respect for wealth, or had favors to ask of him. \"Boys,\" said the principal, \"I sat up till twelve o\u0027clock last evening, examining your papers. I have not only ascertained who are entitled to the two prizes, but I have made a list of the ten highest scholars, with their percentages. I am glad to say that many of you have done well, and I regret that I have not more prizes to bestow. I will now announce the names of the prize boys.\" \"First prize—Benjamin Bradford.\" \"Second prize—Sam Archer.\" The boys applauded noisily. \"Bradford\u0027s percentage,\" continued the principal, \"is ninety-nine and eight-tenths; Archer\u0027s, ninety-seven and nine-tenths. Both are very high and I heartily congratulate both young gentlemen upon their brilliant success. Bradford, you may come up to the desk.\" Mr. Taylor placed in his hands a neat edition of Longfellow\u0027s poems. \"Thank you, sir,\" said Ben. The boys again applauded. \"Archer, you may come up,\" said the principal. Sam rose slowly, and with a discontented look shuffled up to the desk. An edition of Tennyson\u0027s poems was handed to him. He received them without a word of thanks and hurried back to his seat. There was no applause in his case. This was the last day of school, and the session lasted but an hour and a half. At half-past ten the boys poured out of the schoolhouse with noisy demonstrations of joy. \"I congratulate you, old fellow,\" said James Watson to Ben. \"You\u0027ve done splendidly.\" \"Thank you, James.\" \"So do I, and I,\" exclaimed one and another. Ben received all these congratulations modestly. \"Go and congratulate Sam, boys,\" he said. \"A good scholar, but a mean boy,\" said James. \"However, here goes.\" \"I congratulate you on your prize, Sam,\" he said offering his hand. Sam did not appear to see the hand. \"A second prize isn\u0027t worth having,\" he said discontentedly. \"Of course it was all I had a chance for. Bradford is the teacher\u0027s favorite.\" \"Do you mean to say Ben don\u0027t deserve the first prize?\" \"He was sure to get it, anyhow.\" \"That\u0027s mean in you to speak so, Sam.\" \"It\u0027s what I think, at any rate.\" \"Well, Sam,\" said his father, as he entered his presence, \"how is it?\" \"Just as I expected, father. Old Taylor gave the first prize to his favorite, Ben Bradford.\" \"After all the attention I have paid that man, it is positively outrageous to defraud you of your rights.\" \"You won\u0027t have his salary increased now, will you, father?\" \"I\u0027ll do what I can to have the man discharged.\" \"There\u0027s a favor I want to ask of you, father.\" \"What is it, my son?\" \"I hear that Ben Bradford is going to seek employment in the mill, now that school is over; I hope you\u0027ll refuse to take him on.\" \"I will. His prize will cost him dear.\" \"Would you have given him employment if I had beaten him for the prize?\" \"Yes; business has revived, and we have decided to take on some extra hands, giving preference to those who have formerly been in our employ.\" \"Then I will be revenged, at any rate,\" said Sam.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83558.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
