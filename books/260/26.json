{"id":7861,"no":26,"title":"Chapter XXVI — Ben Finds a Boarding-Place","content":"Henry Porter had a fine suite of rooms in the Back Bay District of Boston. Ben spent the night with him. \"You\u0027ve got a nice home,\" said our hero. \"Yes,\" said the bookkeeper. \"My rooms alone cost me fifteen dollars a week.\" \"Without board?\" ejaculated Ben. \"Yes,\" said the young man, smiling. \"Why, that is almost eight hundred dollars a year.\" \"Quite correct. I see you think me extravagant.\" \"I was wondering how you could afford it.\" \"Your surprise is natural. If I only depended on my salary, I certainly should not hire such expensive apartments. But a good aunt left me twenty thousand dollars, two years since, and this being well invested yields me about fourteen hundred dollars a year.\" \"I wonder you don\u0027t go into business.\" \"I have thought of it, but doubt whether I should manage a business of my own judiciously. If not, I should run the risk of losing all my money. I like keeping books for my uncle, and he pays me a good salary. With this and the income from my property I can live as well as I wish without incurring any risk at all.\" \"I don\u0027t know but that is best,\" said Ben. \"Now let me speak of your own plans, Ben. Your income is six dollars a week.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"You must regulate your expenses accordingly.\" \"I want to do so, Mr. Porter. How much board shall I have to pay?\" asked Ben anxiously. \"I cannot tell without inquiring. There is a boarding-house on Warren Avenue, kept by a worthy lady of my acquaintance. How much do you fell able to pay?\" \"I should like to have enough over to buy my clothes.\" \"We will see if we can manage it Get your hat and we will go to the boarding-house now.\" It was a three-story brick house, such as is common in Boston. It was unusually neat for a boarding-house of medium grade, Mrs. Draper being an excellent housekeeper, with a horror of dirt. \"How do you do, Mr. Porter?\" was the landlady\u0027s greeting. Mr. Porter had once boarded with her. \"Very well, thank you, Mrs. Draper. How is business? Pretty full, eh?\" \"Yes, sir; I\u0027ve only got one small room vacant.\" \"May we see it?\" \"It won\u0027t suit you, Mr. Porter.\" \"It may suit my young friend here.\" \"A relative of yours?\" inquired Mrs. Draper. \"No, but he is a young friend in whom I feel an interest.\" \"I shall be very glad if the room suits him, then.\" Mrs. Draper led the way up-stairs to the vacant room. It was small, but neatly carpeted, and provided all that was needful in a chamber. \"How much do you like it, Ben?\" asked the bookkeeper. \"Very much,\" said Ben, in a tone of satisfaction. Mr. Porter walked to the other end of the room and discussed terms with Mrs. Draper in a low tone. \"What is your price for this room with board?\" \"I have generally got six dollars a week.\" \"I want you to let my young friend have it for four.\" \"I really couldn\u0027t do it, Mr. Porter. You have no idea how much I have to pay at the market for meat and vegetables. Then my landlord won\u0027t reduce my rent.\" \"You don\u0027t understand me, Mrs. Draper,\" said the bookkeeper. \"You are to charge him only four dollars; but I propose to make up the difference.\" \"That is, of course, satisfactory.\" \"One thing more. My young friend is not to know about this arrangement. He is to suppose that four dollars a week is payment in full.\" \"There is only one objection to that, Mr. Porter. If my other boarders suppose that is all he pays, they will make a fuss, and want their rate of board reduced.\" \"Then he shall be cautioned to keep the price he pays secret. Ben!\" Ben walked over to where they were standing. \"Mrs. Draper agrees to take you at the very low price of four dollars a week for room and board.\" Ben looked delighted. \"Then I shall have money enough from my wages to pay all my expenses without calling on Aunt Jane.\" \"Yes, if you are economical. As this price is extremely low, you are not to mention to any of the other boarders how much you pay.\" \"I will be sure to remember it,\" said Ben. As they were leaving the house Mr. Porter said: \"Don\u0027t suppose, Ben, that I am anxious to get rid of you. I had half a mind to keep you with me a week or two. But one thing deterred me. You are a poor boy, and have your own way to make in the world. You can\u0027t for years afford to live as I am doing. If I accustomed you to living expensively it would be harder for you to accommodate yourself to your means.\" \"I understand you, Mr. Porter, and thank you. I consider you a true friend,\" said Ben earnestly. \"I see you are a sensible boy, Ben. You are right in looking upon me as a friend. I hope you will come and call upon me often.\" \"Thank you, sir. I shall consider it a privilege to do so. And I hope you will give me any advice that you think will benefit me.\" \"I will, Ben, and I will begin now. We have a large public library in Boston, of which we are very proud. I advise you to draw books from it.\" \"I shall be glad to,\" said Ben eagerly. \"Come round, and I will show it to you.\" Together they entered the handsome building on Copley Square. Ben, who had never seen a large library, or, indeed, any library containing over a thousand books, was amazed at what he saw. \"I didn\u0027t suppose there was any library in the world so large,\" he said. \"Here is the newspaper and magazine room. You can come in here any evening. It will be much better than to spend your time where many boys and young men do—in billiard and drinking saloons.\" \"I shall enjoy living in Boston very much.\" \"I think you will. While a large city has more temptations than a small town, it also has more opportunities for improvement. I hope, Ben, you will start right, and prepare the way for a useful manhood.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Porter. I mean to try.\" The next day Ben took formal possession of his room in the boarding-house on Warren Avenue. He found a pleasant class of boarders there and a good table. Though not luxurious, it was better than he had been used to at home, and he felt himself fortunately placed. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83563.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
