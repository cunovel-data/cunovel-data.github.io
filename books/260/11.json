{"id":7846,"no":11,"title":"Chapter XI — In New York","content":"Of the journey to New York I do not purpose to speak. Ben enjoyed it extremely, for it gave him his first view of the great world. As he whirled by town after town and city after city, and reflected how small, after all, was the distance on the map between Milltown and New York, he got a new idea of the size of the world. \"What are you thinking about, Ben?\" asked Mr. Manning, observing that our hero looked thoughtful. \"I was thinking how large the world is, sir.\" \"Didn\u0027t you ever think of that before?\" \"No, sir; I have always lived in Milltown. I don\u0027t think I was ever ten miles from home before.\" \"Then your ideas were necessarily contracted. One advantage of travel is, that it broadens our views, not only as regards distance, but also of men and things.\" Ben assented, though he did not fully understand his companion\u0027s statement. From time to time Ben asked questions of Mr. Manning; but after a while that gentlemen met a friend on the cars, and Ben was left pretty much to himself. They did not reach New York till midnight. \"I will take you to my boarding-house to-night, Ben,\" said his companion. \"Tomorrow we will talk over our plans.\" A hansom conveyed them to a house in an up-town street, where Mr. Manning boarded. Of course Ben could not at that hour see much of the great city which he was visiting for the first time. Besides, he was quite fatigued, and felt more like closing his eyes in sleep than using them. Mr. Manning\u0027s rooms were very comfortable, and even luxurious. Ben slept soundly till his companion waked him up. \"Come, Ben, it\u0027s eight o\u0027clock, and the breakfast bell is ringing. Haven\u0027t you had sleep enough?\" The sun was shining bright in at the window, and the noise of carriages could be heard in the street beneath. Ben looked about him in momentary bewilderment. \"Don\u0027t you know where you are?\" asked Mr. Manning smiling. \"Yes, I am in New York,\" said Ben, his face brightening up. \"I\u0027ll be dressed in less than no time,\" he exclaimed, leaping out of bed, and setting to work energetically. \"If you keep your promise I certainly can\u0027t complain,\" said Mr. Manning. \"Shall we be late to breakfast?\" asked Ben, with some anxiety. \"There will be others later. So you feel hungry, do you?\" \"Uncommonly hungry,\" said Ben. \"I guess it\u0027s travelling that gives me an appetite. What a nice place you live in, Mr. Manning! It\u0027s very handy having water come out of pipes. How do they do it?\" \"I\u0027ll explain to you some time, when we are not in such a hurry.\" \"All right, sir.\" Ben was soon dressed, and went down to breakfast with his new patron. There was quite a difference between the appearance of the table at this fashionable boarding house and their plain breakfast table at home; but Ben was one who easily adapted himself to new circumstances, and did not display any greenness. \"Now, Ben,\" said Mr. Manning, as they rose from the table, \"I suppose you are not in a very great hurry to go home.\" \"No, sir.\" \"You would like to see a little of the city?\" \"Yes, sir, very much.\" \"I think day after to-morrow will be early enough to go back. You write a line to your aunt, so that she need not feel anxious.\" \"Thank you, sir. Where is the little girl?\" \"She is temporarily staying at the house of a married sister of mine. My sister is rather an invalid, or she might keep her permanently. I shall not have time to go round and introduce you to-day, for my business will occupy me closely.\" \"Where shall I go, sir?\" asked Ben. \"Wherever you like. You can wander round the city, and see whatever pleases you. Only be back a little before six o\u0027clock, for that is our dinner hour.\" \"Dinner at six!\" repeated Ben astonished, for he had always been accustomed to dine at twelve. \"When do you take supper?\" \"We don\u0027t sup at all, that is, not regularly. In the middle of the day we take lunch. You can go into some restaurant, and buy lunch.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Oh, by the by, have you got any money?\" asked Mr. Manning. \"A little,\" answered Ben. \"How much?\" Ben produced thirty-seven cents in change. \"That is rather short allowance,\" said Mr. Manning. \"Here take this.\" He handed him a two-dollar bill. \"I don\u0027t need so much, Mr. Manning,\" said Ben. But two dollars were not so much in the eyes of his patron, as in his. \"I dare say you can find a use for it,\" he said smiling. \"Thank you, sir.\" \"Well, good morning; or perhaps it will be as well for you to accompany me as far as Broadway. There I shall take a car, and you can saunter along as you please.\" A brief walk brought them to Broadway, and then they separated. Ben wandered down Broadway, amused at the sight until he same to Twenty-third Street, where he stopped. Ben look at it with admiration. He had never seen such structures, nor dreamed of their existence. \"New York\u0027s a splendid city!\" he said to himself. As he was looking about him, some one addressed him: \"What are you looking at Johnny?\" \"My name isn\u0027t Johnny,\" answered Ben, turning toward the boy who had accosted him. The boy puffed out his cheeks and whistled. \"When did you come from the country?\" he asked. \"Why are you so anxious to know?\" inquired Ben, who saw that the other was making game of him, and was not overwell pleased. \"Why, you see, Barnum has offered twenty-five cents for a country greenhorn, and I guess you\u0027ll do,\" said the boy, with his tongue in his cheek. Ben was irritated at first, but he concluded to take it as a joke. \"I am not for sale at that price,\" he said, adding good humoredly, \"I am green, I suppose. This is my first visit to the city. Can you tell me the name of that building?\" \"That\u0027s the Imperial Hotel. Have you got a cigarette to spare?\" \"No,\" said Ben; \"I don\u0027t smoke.\" \"Then you ain\u0027t civilized,\" said the boy. \"I\u0027ve smoked for five years.\" \"You have!\" exclaimed Ben, amazed. \"Why, you don\u0027t look any older than I am.\" \"I\u0027m sixteen.\" \"And I\u0027m not quite fifteen.\" Ben noticed that the boy had none of the youthful bloom which mantled his own cheeks. He was already paying the penalty of his early use of tobacco. \"You\u0027re a big boy of your age,\" said the city boy. Ben thought that the other was small for his age, but he did not say so. \"Look here, Johnny,\" said the New York boy. \"My name is Ben.\" \"What\u0027s the odds? Well, Ben, if you\u0027ll give me a quarter. I\u0027ll go round and show you some of the sights; what do you say?\" Ben hesitated. It seemed to him a little extravagant. At the same time his curiosity was aroused, and he finally agreed to the proposal. When he returned to his home in the country, he felt that he should like to be able to tell his companions something of the city he had visited. \"Give me five cents in advance,\" said the newly engaged guide. \"What for?\" asked Ben, cautiously. \"I want to get some cigarettes.\" Ben complied with his request. The boy darted into a small cigar store, and soon emerged with a cigarette in his mouth at which he puffed with evident pleasure. \"Won\u0027t you try one?\" he asked. \"I guess not,\" said Ben. \"Come along, then. You ask any questions about what you see, and I\u0027ll answer.\" \"What\u0027s that field? It\u0027s a common, isn\u0027t it?\" asked Ben pointing to a park after they walked down Broadway for a few blocks. \"Oh, that\u0027s Madison Park; but we\u0027ve got a good deal bigger park than that up-town. Central Park—that\u0027s the name of it.\" \"Is it far off?\" \"About two miles. Do you want to go there?\" \"No, I\u0027d rather see the streets, and the nice buildings. I can see plenty of fields at home.\" \"Are you going to stay long in the city?\" asked, Tom, for this Ben learned was the name of his companion. \"Only a day or two. I want to see as much as I can while I am here.\" They walked down Broadway, Tom pointing out the prominent buildings, and answering the numerous questions asked by Ben. On the whole, he proved to be a very good investment in the way of a guide, being well-informed on the subjects about which Ben inquired. When they reached the Astor House, Tom said: \"I guess you\u0027ve got a quarter\u0027s worth out of me. If you want me any longer you must give me another quarter.\" \"I can\u0027t afford it,\" said Ben, \"I guess I can get round by myself now.\" So Tom left him with scant ceremony, and Ben sat down on a bench in City Hall Park to rest.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83548.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
