{"id":7862,"no":27,"title":"Chapter XXVII — Sam Attempts Strategy","content":"The more Sam Archer thought of the effect of his letter upon Ben\u0027s fortunes the more he felt provoked. \"I wish I hadn\u0027t sent him to Jones \u0026 Porter,\" thought he. \"I hope he won\u0027t suit them.\" When a fortnight had passed Sam managed to meet James Watson. \"Have you heard from Ben Bradford lately?\" \"Yes,\" said James. \"What does he write?\" \"That he likes his place very much. The bookkeeper is very kind to him, and assists him with advice. Then he likes being in a bookstore.\" Sam was not overjoyed at the news. \"How kind you are to take such an interest in Ben!\" \"I don\u0027t take an interest in him,\" returned Sam. \"Then what makes you ask after him so particularly?\" \"I expected he\u0027d be discharged by this time.\" \"What made you think so?\" \"He didn\u0027t give satisfaction at the mill. He was discharged.\" \"So was I.\" \"But not for the same reasons,\" said Sam. \"It was because times were dull.\" \"I rather think Ben\u0027s work was satisfactory enough, but you influenced your father against him.\" \"How much pay does he get?\" inquired Sam. \"More than he received at the mill.\" \"I wonder whether all this is true,\" considered Sam. \"James Watson is Ben\u0027s friend and he may represent things better than they are.\" An excellent plan suggested itself to Sam. He would ask his father\u0027s permission to go to Boston and pass a day or two with his friend, Frank Ferguson. This would allow him to drop into Jones \u0026 Porter\u0027s store and judge for himself how Ben was situated. Sam had no trouble about obtaining permission. On reaching the city he decided to call at the store before going to his friend\u0027s residence. Ben was dusting books, when a glance toward the door revealed the entrance of Sam. The latter had cherished a faint hope that James had deceived him, and that Ben was really not employed. \"How shall I receive him?\" Ben asked himself. He decided to treat him coolly, but not to quarrel. \"Good morning, Bradford,\" said Sam. \"Good morning, Archer,\" was the return greeting. Sam didn\u0027t quite like this familiarity. \"How do you like working here?\" \"Very much,\" answered Ben. \"Much better than in the mill,\" he added significantly. \"I shouldn\u0027t think they\u0027d have taken a green country boy,\" suggested Sam pleasantly. \"Perhaps they wouldn\u0027t if a friend hadn\u0027t written for me,\" said Ben with a meaning glance at Sam. \"How much pay do you get?\" \"I would rather not say.\" \"Because it is so small,\" said Sam, with a sneer. \"On the contrary, I look upon it as liberal. I am doing better than if I had remained at Milltown.\" This was bad news for Sam. \"I am really obliged to the person who wrote the letter which secured me the position,\" Ben added. \"It isn\u0027t much of a business to dust books.\" \"I sell books sometimes,\" said Ben, smiling. \"Can I show you something this morning.\" \"No, I don\u0027t want anything. Where do you live?\" \"I board on Warren Avenue.\" \"In a cheap boarding-house?\" \"There are some very nice people who board there.\" Sam came to a sudden decision. Would it be possible to induce Ben to give up his place, and enter the mill again? He could be discharged after awhile, and cast adrift. It was rather foolish to suppose that Ben would snap at such a bait, but he decided to try it. \"I think you would be better off in the mill,\" he said. \"You could board at home, and help your aunt. You would soon be promoted, too.\" \"I thought you didn\u0027t want me to enter the mill,\" exclaimed Ben, amazed. \"Your father told me that my record was not good;\" and Ben looked indignant. \"Father was feeling out of sorts,\" said Sam smoothly. \"He will take you on if you\u0027ll come back.\" \"What does the fellow mean?\" thought Ben. It didn\u0027t take him long to guess. If he should return to the mill he would be once more in Sam\u0027s power. \"You really think your father would employ me?\" \"Yes, he would if I asked him to.\" \"I would thank you, Sam Archer, if I thought your offer was a friendly one.\" \"What makes you think that it isn\u0027t.\" \"The feeling which I have reason to think you entertain for me, and your conduct in the past.\" \"You are too suspicious, Ben.\" \"If I find I am, I will apologize to you. It would be foolish for me to give up so good a position in order to accept a poor one, which is not all permanent.\" \"Well, Bradford, I must bid you good morning. Just write to me if you decide to accept.\" \"If I decide to accept I will.\" \"He\u0027s getting very impudent,\" said Sam to himself, \"If I could only get him into the mill I could fix him. We\u0027d let him stay two or three weeks, and then ship him. But he won\u0027t do it. Stay, I think of a way.\" What the way was may be conjectured from a letter which Ben received three days later from his Aunt Jane: \"My Dear Nephew: I am feeling almost heart-broken. It is reported by one who saw you lately that you are looking very dissipated. I was afraid the temptations of the city were too much for you. You are too young to go away from home. I won\u0027t blame you too much, for I feel that you are weak rather than wicked. But I shall not feel comfortable till you are at home again. Don\u0027t hesitate to give up your place. I am assured that they will take you on again at the mill, and it will be much better for you to be at home with us, till you are older, and better able to resist temptation. \"Your anxious aunt, \"Jane Bradford\" Ben read this letter in amazed indignation. \"Sam is at the bottom of this,\" he concluded. \"It is he that has reported that I look dissipated. He wants to deprive me of my place, and get me into the mill, where I shall be in his power. I can\u0027t forgive him for frightening my poor aunt. If I were at home, I should certainly punish him as he deserves.\" Ben took the letter to his friend, the bookkeeper. \"What do you think of that?\" he asked. \"This letter was written at an enemy\u0027s instigation.\" \"You are right, Mr. Porter.\" Then Ben told his friend of Sam\u0027s call. \"Will you do me a favor, Mr. Porter?\" he asked. \"Certainly I will, Ben.\" \"Then, will you write to my aunt, and assure her that my habits are good, and that her informant has willfully lied? It will relieve her anxiety.\" \"With pleasure.\" The next day Mrs. Bradford received a letter, very enthusiastic in its tone, which completely exonerated our hero from the charges brought against him. \"Your nephew,\" it concluded, \"bids fair to become one of our best clerks. He is polite, faithful, and continually trying to improve. You need have no apprehension about him. It would be very foolish for him to resign his situation.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83564.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
