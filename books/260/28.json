{"id":7863,"no":28,"title":"Chapter XXVIII — Sam Praises Ben","content":"The same mail that carried the bookkeeper\u0027s letter to Mrs. Bradford also carried a letter from Ben to Sam Archer. It ran thus: \"Sam Archer: You might be in better business than telling lies about me to my aunt. If you think I look dissipated your eyes deceive you, and I advise you to wear glasses the next time you come to Boston. If you choose to come to the store, it is none of my business; but you need not take the trouble in order to see me. I quite understand your anxiety to get me back into the mill. There was a time when I should have been glad of a place there; but now I have a place that suits me better, and don\u0027t care to change. \"Benjamin Bradford\" When Sam received this letter, he looked and felt provoked. Somehow or other Ben was always getting the better of him. He wanted to injure him, but there seemed no way. Suddenly it occurred to Sam that he might prejudice Jones \u0026 Porter against our hero. He sat down at once and wrote them an anonymous letter, of which this is a copy: \"Messrs. Jones \u0026 Porter: I hear that you have taken into your employment a boy named Benjamin Bradford from this town. You probably are not aware that he has a very bad reputation here. He was employed in the mill for a time, but was discharged because he was idle and lazy. He keeps bad company, and none of the respectable boys here cared to associate with him. I don\u0027t like to see an honorable firm imposed upon, and that is why I warn you of the character of your new clerk, though I have no personal interest in the matter. \"A Friend\" The next day Ben was summoned to the countingroom. \"Ben,\" said Mr. Porter, \"have you any enemy in Milltown?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"We have just received a letter warning us against you, as unworthy of our confidence.\" Mr. Porter smiled, or Ben might have felt uncomfortable. \"May I see the letter?\" he asked. The letter was placed in his hands. \"It is Sam Archer\u0027s handwriting,\" he said, looking up. \"I hope, sir, you won\u0027t let it prejudice you against me.\" \"I would not allow myself to be influenced by an anonymous letter. It is a stab in the dark.\" \"I want to show you how inconsistent Sam is,\" said Ben. \"He was here a few days ago, and urged me to give up my place here, and take one in the mill.\" \"That is rather strange, if he is your enemy.\" \"No, sir; he don\u0027t like it because I have a good place here. If I should go into the mill I should probably be discharged in a week or two, and cast adrift.\" \"Are any boys as malicious as that?\" \"Not many, sir, I hope; but Sam is an exception.\" \"I sympathize with you in your persecution, Ben; but I can assure you that no anonymous letters will change my opinion of you. If this enemy sends another letter, I shall feel tempted to increase your wages.\" \"Then I hope he\u0027ll write again,\" said Ben, laughing. \"If we continue satisfied with you, we shall probably advance you on the first of January.\" \"Thank you, sir,\" said Ben warmly. \"May I answer this letter, sir?\" \"You may say that we have shown it to you, and that we despise such malicious attempts to injure.\" The next day Sam received a letter from Ben, which concluded: \"If you write another similar letter to my employers, you will be doing me quite a service. It will probably cause them to raise my salary. As I owe my place to you, you now have it in your power to increase the obligation. How bad you must feel, Sam, at your inability to do me harm! I can\u0027t say I exactly sympathize with you, but I certainly pity you for harboring such malice in your heart. I don\u0027t know how to express my gratitude for all of your kindness. If ever you want a situation in Boston let me know. There is a peanut woman on the Common who wants a smart, active salesman. \"Ben Bradford\" Sam was stung by the cool indifference and contempt which appeared in this letter. Ben did not take the trouble to be angry. He evidently despised his enmity, and defied him. Sam felt that he hated Ben worse. \"What\u0027s that letter you are scowling over, Sam?\" asked James Watson. \"It\u0027s a letter from a miserable puppy,\" hissed Sam. \"Is it? Do you correspond with miserable puppies?\" \"I can\u0027t help their writing to me. If you want to know who it is, it\u0027s your friend, Ben Bradford.\" \"How long have you corresponded?\" asked James. \"I wouldn\u0027t lower myself by writing to him,\" said Sam wrathfully. \"I\u0027ll show you what I think of his letter.\" As he spoke, he tore the letter to pieces. \"You\u0027re a strange boy, Sam,\" said James. \"Why am I?\" \"Haven\u0027t you been working hard to get Ben back to Milltown?\" \"I wish he\u0027d come back.\" \"And yet you can\u0027t bear the sight of him.\" \"I hate him worse than any fellow I know.\" \"Come, now, Sam, just listen to a little advice. If you had always treated Ben right you would like him as well as I do. Why should you cherish malice against him? He has good qualities, and so have you, if you\u0027d only give \u0027em a chance to show themselves.\" \"That\u0027s all gammon,\" said Sam impatiently. \"What, about your having good qualities?\" \"About my ever liking Ben Bradford. Before I\u0027d make a friend of him, I would go without friends.\" \"You may think differently some time.\" On the first of January Ben wrote to his aunt: \"My Dear Aunt: Congratulate me on my good luck. Mr. Porter, this morning, called me into the countingroom, and informed me that henceforth my wages would be eight dollars a week—two dollars more that I have been receiving. I owe this partly to my good luck. I am a favorite of the bookkeeper, who is Mr. Porter\u0027s nephew; otherwise, if I had been advanced at all, it would have been only one dollar a week. Don\u0027t you think it would have been rather foolish if I had come back and gone into the mill, as you wished me to?\" \"After all, I think Ben did right to stay,\" said Aunt Jane, when she read the letter. \"I wish he\u0027d come home,\" said Tony. \"Then he could play with me.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83565.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
