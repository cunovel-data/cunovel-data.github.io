{"id":7873,"no":38,"title":"Chapter XXXVIII — Conclusion","content":"\"Ben,\" said Mr. Baldwin, \"let us talk over your plans. Do you wish to remain at the store, or would you like to get a better education?\" \"I would get a better education if I could afford it, sir.\" \"You can afford it on an income of a thousand dollars a year.\" \"A thousand dollars a year!\" exclaimed Ben. \"That is the income I shall allow you. Out of this you will be expected to pay all of your expenses.\" \"How can I thank you, sir? Would you object to my giving Aunt Jane a part of the money?\" \"Yes, I shall object.\" Ben\u0027s countenance fell. \"But, Uncle Matthew,\" he said, \"I don\u0027t like to live in luxury, while Aunt Jane is straitened.\" \"Your feelings do you credit, my boy; but I mean to take care of your Aunt Jane myself. She is my niece, and you—I am not sure whether you are related to me at all, but I want you to call me Uncle Matthew all the same.\" \"I shall like to, sir. No uncle could be kinder.\" \"That is well,\" said the old gentleman. \"You know, Ben, I have no one else to care for. Now, do you think your Aunt Jane will be willing to move to Boston?\" \"I am sure she will like it.\" \"Then I shall hire or buy a comfortable house, install her as mistress, require you to live with me while you are attending school, and tyrannize over you all.\" There was a bright smile on the old man\u0027s face. He was looking forward to the new life with anticipations of a happiness and comfort which had long been strangers to him. \"How happy we shall all be, Uncle Matthew! Even Aunt Jane will forget to look on the dark side.\" \"I hope so, Ben. I think we can be happy together.\" \"There is one thing I forgot to tell you,\" he said later. \"I shall expect you to pay your board out of your income, you know. If you fail to make regular payments, we shall have to bundle you out.\" \"I will remember,\" said Ben, smiling. By arrangement Ben went up to Milltown alone to tell his aunt the news. He entered the little house with a sober face. \"I see you bring bad news, Benjamin,\" said Mrs. Bradford mournfully. \"You will have to leave the house, Aunt Jane.\" \"And go to the poorhouse! I knew it would turn out that way,\" and Mrs. Bradford put her handkerchief to her eyes. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked Tony. \"My poor child,\" said his mother, \"we are going to the poorhouse.\" \"Is that so, Ben?\" asked Tony soberly. Ben shouted with laughter. He could not hold back the truth. \"Aunt Jane,\" he said, \"you always will anticipate the worst. Why don\u0027t you wait and hope?\" \"What is the use, Benjamin?\" \"Because it makes us happier, and often brings good fortune. Aunt Jane, you see before you a rich man.\" \"You\u0027re only a boy,\" said Tony. \"You ain\u0027t a man at all.\" \"My income is a thousand dollars a year!\" \"Is it possible, Benjamin?\" ejaculated Mrs. Bradford, in amazement. \"It is more than that; it\u0027s true. You are coming to Boston to live, and I am going to board with you.\" \"The boy\u0027s crazy!\" exclaimed Mrs. Bradford. \"Then there is a method in my madness, Aunt Jane. But I won\u0027t keep you in suspense any longer. Uncle Matthew isn\u0027t dead at all. He\u0027s taken a fancy to me, and is going to allow me an income of a thousand dollars a year. He will take care of you and Tony, too. He is going to hire or buy a house in Boston, and we are all going to live together. What do you say to that? Will you go, or do you prefer to go to the poorhouse?\" Mrs. Bradford made up her mind at once to go to Boston. No one had ever seen her so cheerful as she was for the remainder of the day. Not to dwell upon details, in less than a month the little family was installed in a comfortable house in Boston. Tony had commenced attending school near-by, and Ben had been admitted to the Latin School, where he began to prepare for college in earnest. Porter \u0026 Jones were sorry to lose him, but agreed that he had chosen wisely in abandoning business for a school. Ben is now an undergraduate at Harvard College, with a high rank for scholarship. He has not decided upon his future course; but it is possible that his uncle may purchase an interest for him, at graduation, in the firm where he served as a boy. I cannot close without recording, with satisfaction, the great improvement that has taken place in Sam Archer. Always a bright and smart boy, in adversity he has gotten rid of his disagreeable traits and developed a business capacity which promises well for his future success. Ben has done him many favors, and the two are excellent friends. Of Mr. Archer nothing has been heard. It is rumored that he is living in an obscure town in France, on the proceeds of his defalcation. Sam promises to redeem the name which his father has sullied. Uncle Matthew is several years older than when we first met him, but happiness has had the effect of making him look younger. He probably has several years of life yet before him. He is attached to his niece and Tony, who is now a bright schoolboy of twelve; but his chief attachment is to Ben, whose college career he follows with pride and satisfaction. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83575.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
