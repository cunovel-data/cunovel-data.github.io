{"id":7854,"no":19,"title":"Chapter XIX — The Prize for Scholarship","content":"The annual examination of the grammar schools in Milltown came about the middle of June, just before summer vacation. It the First Ward School two prizes had been offered by the principal to the scholars who stood highest on the rank-lists. Speculation was rife as to the probable result; but the choice was finally narrowed down to two boys. One of these was Ben Bradford, now sixteen years of age. The other was Samuel Archer, son of the superintendent of the Milton Mills. There is an old saying, \"Like father, like son.\" Mr. Archer was purse-proud and consequential, and felt that he was entitled to deference on the score of his wealth and prominence. \"Sam,\" said he, two days before the examination, \"what are your chances of obtaining the prize?\" \"I think I ought to have it, father,\" answered Sam. \"That is, you think you will be entitled to it?\" \"Yes sir.\" \"Then you will get it, as a matter of course.\" \"I don\u0027t know that.\" \"Don\u0027t you think the prize will be adjudged fairly?\" \"The principal thinks a great deal of Ben Bradford.\" \"Is he your chief competitor?\" \"He is the only boy I am afraid of.\" \"Who is he?\" \"He is a poor boy—used to work in the mills.\" \"He is the nephew of the Widow Bradford?\" \"Yes; he lives in a small house about the size of a bandbox. I expect they are as poor as poverty. Ben wears coarse clothes. I don\u0027t believe he has a new suit a year.\" \"And you have too many. I believe your bill for clothes exceeds mine.\" \"Oh, father, you want your son to dress well. People know you are a rich man and they expect it.\" \"Humph! it may be carried too far,\" said Mr. Archer, who had just paid a large tailor\u0027s bill for Sam. \"And you say the principal favors him?\" \"Yes, everybody can see it.\" \"It is rather strange he should favor a penniless boy,\" said Mr. Archer, himself a worshiper of wealth. \"The man don\u0027t know on which side his bread is buttered.\" \"So I think. He ought to consider that you are a man of consequence here.\" \"I rather think I have some influence in Milltown,\" said Mr. Archer, with vulgar complacency; \"I fancy I could oust Mr. Taylor from his position if I caught him indulging in favoritism. But you may be mistaken, Sam.\" Mr. Archer looked thoughtful. Finally he said: \"I think it will be well to pay some attention to Mr. Taylor. It may turn the scale. When you go to school to-morrow I will send by you an invitation to Mr. Taylor to dine with us. We\u0027ll give him a good dinner and get him good-natured.\" So when Sam went to school in the morning he bore a note from his father, containing a dinner invitation. \"Say to your father that I will accept his invitation with pleasure,\" said the principal. It was the first time he had received such a mark of attention from Mr. Archer, and, being a shrewd man, he understood at once what it signified. \"He\u0027s coming, father,\" announced Sam, on his return home. \"Did he seem gratified by the invitation?\" \"I couldn\u0027t tell exactly. He said he would accept with pleasure.\" \"No doubt, he feels the attention,\" said Mr. Archer pompously. \"He knows I am a man of prominence and influence, and the invitation will give him social status.\" Mr. Archer would have been offended if he had been told that the principal was more highly respected in town than himself, in spite of his wealth and fine house. When the principal sat down to Mr. Archer\u0027s dinner table, he partook of a dinner richer and more varied than his modest salary enabled him to indulge in at home. Nevertheless, he had more than once been as well entertained by others, and rather annoyed Mr. Archer by not appearing to appreciate the superiority of the dinner. \"Confound the man! He takes it as coolly as if he were accustomed to dine as sumptuously every day,\" thought Archer. \"I hope you are enjoying dinner, Mr. Taylor,\" he said. \"Very much, thank you.\" \"I rather plume myself on my cook. I venture to say that I pay five dollars a month more than any other person in Milltown. But I must have a good dinner. I am very particular on that score.\" \"Have you a good cook, Mr. Taylor?\" asked Mrs. Archer condescendingly. \"Why, the fact is, that we keep but one servant.\" \"I suppose your salary will not permit you to keep more than one servant.\" \"You are right, madam.\" \"Really, Mr. Taylor, I think your salary ought to be increased,\" said Mr. Archer graciously. \"The laborer is worthy of his hire, eh? I must see if I can\u0027t induce the town to vote you an increased compensation.\" \"Thank you,\" said the principal quietly. \"A larger salary would, of course, be acceptable, but I doubt whether the town will feel like voting it.\" \"Rest easy,\" said Mr. Archer pompously. \"I think I can bring it about.\" \"Oh, by the by,\" continued the rich man, \"Samuel tells me that you have offered two scholarship prizes.\" \"Yes, sir—to the two scholars who pass the best examination.\" \"How does my boy stand in the matter?\" \"He is one of the most prominent competitors.\" \"I am very glad to hear it—very glad. Sam, you must do your best to-morrow. It would gratify me very much if you should succeed. I am ambitious for my son, Mr. Taylor, and I don\u0027t mind admitting it.\" \"Your ambition is a very natural one,\" said the principal. \"Sam\u0027s scholarship is excellent and his record is very satisfactory.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Taylor. Your assurance is deeply gratifying to Mrs. Archer and myself. It will be the happiest day of our lives if Sam succeeds in the approaching competition.\" \"He has a very fair chance of success, sir.\" \"I think I\u0027ve fixed things,\" said Mr. Archer complacently, after the principal had taken his leave. \"The prize is as good as yours, Sam.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83556.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
