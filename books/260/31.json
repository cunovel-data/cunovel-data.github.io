{"id":7866,"no":31,"title":"Chapter XXXI — Clouds in the Sky","content":"Ben felt that he and his aunt were fortunately situated. From the time when his salary was raised he had laid aside two dollars a week, which he deposited in the savings-bank on School Street. His aunt, having no rent to pay, easily got along on her income from work and from the liberal board paid for little Emma. \"I am getting on,\" thought Ben, complacently regarding his bank book, at the end of three months. \"I am worth twenty-six dollars already.\" Little Emma, his aunt\u0027s boarder, was a child of pleasant disposition, and had given little trouble to Mrs. Bradford. Her health, too, had been excellent, until all at once she became pale and thin. Mrs. Bradford felt it her duty to report this to Mr. Manning, the child\u0027s guardian. By his direction, a skillful physician was consulted, who gave it as his opinion that the best thing for the child would be a sea voyage. This was communicated to Mr. Manning. \"Fortunately,\" he responded, \"my sister starts in a fortnight for Europe. She will be absent six months. I have prevailed upon her to take charge of Emma.\" Mrs. Bradford was glad that the little girl would have a chance to recover her former health and bloom; but she felt her loss doubly, on account of her society, and on account of the loss of income which her absence would involve. It was not until after Emma had actually gone that she felt the full force of the last consideration. So the poor woman wrote a doleful letter to Ben, in which she predicted that Tony and herself must soon go to the poorhouse. When this letter reached Ben his duty was set plainly before him. From his regular income he could spare two dollars a week, and, taking two dollars weekly from his reserve fund, he would be enabled to allow his aunt four dollars a week, which, added to her own earnings, would maintain her and Tony in comfort. \"My dear aunt,\" he wrote, \"don\u0027t talk of going to the poorhouse just yet. You forget that you have a rich nephew in Boston, who is unwilling that any of his relations should live at public expense unless they get into public office. I don\u0027t suppose there is any chance of your getting elected member of Congress. As it is, I shall send you every week four, dollars, which I hope will provide you with your usual comfort. I can keep up this allowance for twenty weeks, and that will carry you nearly to the time when Emma will return to you; then all will be right again.\" Ben began to save a dollar more. He wanted to prepare for the time when his little fund would be exhausted. If by that time he had twelve dollars more, he would be able to continue to his aunt her regular allowance, till the six months were at an end. The thought that he had arranged matters so satisfactory made Ben quite cheerful. He realized the advantage of the habit of saving. He was encouraged also by some help which he received from the bookkeeper. \"Ben,\" said he, \"do you spend all your salary?\" \"Yes, Mr. Porter, I am obliged to.\" \"I should think you could save something out of eight dollars a week, as only four goes for board.\" \"So I could, but I have to help my aunt.\" \"I thought she was provided for,\" said Mr. Porter. \"Doesn\u0027t she get seven dollars a week for boarding a little girl?\" \"She did; but the little girl is now in Europe.\" \"I suppose you cannot send much to your aunt.\" \"I send her four dollars a week.\" \"Four dollars a week!\" exclaimed the young man, in surprise. \"Why, that allows you nothing after paying your board.\" The Ben told his friend about his savings. \"Doesn\u0027t it seem hard to have your earnings used up in this way?\" asked the bookkeeper. \"No,\" answered Ben cheerfully. \"You are an excellent boy, Ben. You have done just the right thing. I am glad you are so unselfish.\" \"I am afraid I am selfish as the majority of boys; but I am not mean enough to let my aunt and little cousin suffer.\" \"I believe you consider me a friend of yours, Ben.\" \"I consider you one of the best friends I have, Mr. Porter,\" said Ben warmly. \"Then you must allow me a friend\u0027s privilege.\" As he said this he drew from his pocketbook a twenty-dollar bill, and put it into Ben\u0027s hands. \"Thank you very much, Mr. Porter; but ought I to accept so much?\" \"Certainly. Remember that my means are considerable, and that I have no one dependent upon me.\" Ben felt that his companion derived pleasure from his gift, and he did not see why he should make any further objections. He added the twenty dollars to his savings-book fund, and said to himself: \"There will be no trouble now in tiding over the six months.\" But it is said misfortunes never come singly. The very next day his aunt received a lawyer\u0027s letter, which plunged her into the deepest despondency. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83568.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
