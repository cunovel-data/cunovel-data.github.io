{"id":7837,"no":2,"title":"Chapter II — Three Situations","content":"Before going further it may be as well to explain exactly how the Bradfords were situated. To begin with, they had no rent to pay. The small house in which they lived belonged to an old bachelor uncle of Mrs. Bradford, living in Montreal, and all they were required to do was to pay the taxes, which amounted to very little, not more than twelve dollars a year. Ben had earned at the factory five dollars a week, and his aunt averaged two. To some readers it may seem remarkable that three persons could live and clothe themselves on seven dollars a week; but Mrs. Bradford was a good manager, and had not found the problem a difficult one. Now, however, the question promised to become more difficult. If Ben found nothing to do, the family would be reduced to two dollars a week, and to live comfortably on that small sum might well appal the most skilful financier. Ben woke up early, and immediately began to consider the situation. His motto was \"Wait and Hope\"; but he knew very well that he must work while he was waiting and hoping, otherwise he would differ very little from the hopeful Micawber, who was always waiting for something to turn up. \"Aunt Jane,\" he said, after a frugal breakfast, over which Mrs. Bradford presided with an uncommonly long face, \"how much money have you got on hand? I want to know just how we stand.\" Mrs. Bradford opened her pocketbook with a sigh, and produced two one-dollar bills and thirty-seven cents in change. \"There\u0027s only that between us and starvation,\" she said mournfully. \"Well, that\u0027s something,\" said Ben cheerfully. \"Isn\u0027t it, Tony?\" \"It\u0027s a lot of money,\" said the inexperienced Tony. \"I never had so much in all my life.\" \"There, somebody thinks you are rich, Aunt Jane,\" laughed Ben. \"What should the poor child know of household expenses?\" said Mrs. Bradford. \"To be sure. Only we may get some money before that is used up. They owe me at the factory for half a week—two dollars and a half. I shall get it Saturday night. We won\u0027t starve for a week, you see.\" \"Where are you going, Ben?\" asked Tony; \"won\u0027t you stay and play with me?\" \"I can\u0027t, Tony. I must go out, and see if I can find something to do.\" Milltown was something more than a village. In fact, it had been incorporated two years before as a city, having the requisite number of inhabitants. The main street was quite city-like, being lined with stores. \"I wonder if I can\u0027t get a change in a store,\" thought Ben. So he made his way to the principal street, and entered the first store he came to—a large dry-goods store. Entering, he addressed himself to a small, thin man, with an aquiline nose, who seemed to have a keen scent for money. \"What can I do for you, young man?\" he asked, taking Ben for a customer. \"Can you give me a place in your store?\" asked Ben. The small man\u0027s expression changed instantly. \"What do you know of the dry-goods trade?\" he inquired. \"Nothing at present, but I could learn,\" answered our hero. \"Then, I\u0027ll make you an offer.\" Ben brightened up. \"If you come into the store for nothing the first year, I\u0027ll give you two dollars a week the second.\" \"Do you take me for a man of property?\" asked Ben, disgusted. The small man replied with a shrill, creaking laugh, sounding like the grating of a rusty hinge. \"Isn\u0027t that fair?\" he asked. \"You didn\u0027t expect to come in as partner first thing, did you?\" \"No, but I can\u0027t work for nothing.\" \"Then—lemme see—I\u0027ll give you fifty cents a week for the first year, and you can take it out in goods.\" \"No, thank you,\" answered Ben. \"I couldn\u0027t afford it.\" As he went out of the store, he heard another grating laugh, and the remark: \"That\u0027s the way to bluff \u0027em off. I offered him a place, and he wouldn\u0027t take it.\" Ben was at first indignant, but then his sense of humor got the better of his anger, and he said to himself: \"Well, I\u0027ve been offered a position, anyway, and that\u0027s something. Perhaps I shall have better luck at the next place.\" The next place happened to be a druggist\u0027s. The druggist, a tall man, with scanty black locks, was compounding some pills behind the counter. Ben was not bashful, and he advanced at once, and announced his business. \"Don\u0027t you want a boy?\" he asked. The druggist smiled. \"I\u0027ve got three at home,\" he answered. \"I really don\u0027t think I should like to adopt another.\" \"I\u0027m not in the market for adoption,\" said Ben, smiling. \"I want to get into some store to learn the business.\" \"Have you any particular fancy for the druggist\u0027s business?\" asked the apothecary. \"No, sir, I can\u0027t say that I have.\" \"I never took much, but enough to know that I don\u0027t like it.\" \"Then I am afraid you wouldn\u0027t do for experiment clerk.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"Oh, it his duty to try all the medicines, to make sure there are no wrong ingredients in them—poison, for instance.\" \"I am afraid I shouldn\u0027t like that,\" said Ben. \"You don\u0027t know till you\u0027ve tried. Here\u0027s a pill now. Suppose you take that, and tell me how you like it.\" The druggist extended to Ben a nauseous-looking pill, nearly as large as a bullet. He had made it extra large, for Ben\u0027s special case. \"No, I thank you,\" said Ben, with a contortion of the face; \"I know I wouldn\u0027t do for experiment clerk. Don\u0027t you need any other clerk? Couldn\u0027t I learn to mix medicines?\" \"Well, you see, there would be danger at first—to the customers, I mean. You might poison somebody, and then I would be liable for damages. If you will get somebody to sign a bond, forfeiting ten thousand dollars in any such case, I might consider your application.\" \"I don\u0027t think I could find any such person,\" said Ben. \"Then I am afraid I can\u0027t employ you. You are quite sure you don\u0027t want to be experiment clerk?\" \"And swallow your medicines? I guess not. Good morning.\" \"Good morning. If you want any pills, you will know where to come.\" \"I would rather go where they make \u0027em smaller,\" said Ben. Ben and the druggist both laughed, and the former left the shop. \"That\u0027s the second situation I have been offered today,\" soliloquized our hero. \"They were not very desirable, either one of them, to be sure, but it shows there\u0027s an opening for me somewhere.\" The next was a cigar store. \"I might as well go in,\" thought Ben. A little hump-backed man was behind the counter. \"Want to hire a boy?\" asked Ben. \"Are you the boy?\" \"Yes.\" \"What can you do?\" \"I am willing to do anything.\" The hunchback grinned. \"Then perhaps I can give you a situation. Will you work for three dollars a week?\" Ben reflected. \"That will do, with strict economy,\" he thought, \"till the factory takes me on again.\" \"I\u0027ll come for a few weeks, at that rate,\" he said. \"But perhaps you won\u0027t like your duties,\" said the hunchback, grinning in a curious manner. \"What would be my duties?\" \"I should paint you red, and have you stand outside the door, as an Indian,\" was the answer. Ben didn\u0027t relish the joke. \"You\u0027d better take that position yourself,\" he retorted. \"Nobody\u0027d know the difference.\" \"Get out!\" roared the cigar dealer angrily. Ben left at once. \"That\u0027s the third situation I\u0027ve been offered,\" he said: \"I\u0027d give \u0027em all three for a decent one.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83539.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
