{"id":7867,"no":32,"title":"Chapter XXXII — The Blow Falls","content":"This is the material portion of Mrs. Bradford\u0027s letter to Ben: \"Dear Benjamin: The blow has fallen at last. I felt that our prosperity was not lasting, though I never could make you believe it. I have always expected the worst, and it has come. Benjamin, we are ruined; I shall end my days in the poorhouse after all. If you want an explanation, read the letter which I enclose.\" The letter enclosed was from Solomon Brief, attorney, of Montreal, informing Mrs. Bradford that, as executor of the estate of the late Matthew Baldwin, of Montreal, he begged to remind her that for five years she had failed to pay the rent on a tenement owned by the deceased, and which he now found it to be his duty to demand. At sixty dollars per year, without interest, this would now amount to three hundred dollars, which he hoped Mrs. Bradford would see the propriety of paying at once. Mrs. Bradford continued: I don\u0027t know whether they will put me in jail or not; but you know that I cannot pay this money, and couldn\u0027t if I had five years to do it in. What will become of us all I don\u0027t know. \u0027Man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.\u0027 \"Your sorrowful aunt, \"Jane Bradford. \"P.S.—I am sure your Uncle Matthew never intended that I should pay the rent. He once wrote me a letter to that effect, but I can\u0027t find it.\" Even Ben, hopeful as he was, looked sober after reading this letter. He went to his friend, the bookkeeper. \"Have you ever seen your uncle, Ben?\" he inquired. \"No, sir.\" \"What was his reputation?\" \"He was considered wealthy.\" \"It is a pity you could not visit Montreal, and make some inquiries,\" said the bookkeeper thoughtfully. \"Of course I can\u0027t do that.\" \"Then, first of all, write to this lawyer, and inquire the particulars of Mr. Baldwin\u0027s death; and next, how his property is left. Then make him acquainted with the terms on which your aunt has occupied her house.\" This advice seemed reasonable, and Ben adopted it. As Ben left the store at six o\u0027clock, one evening, he brushed by an old man with a bent figure and apparently feeble. He stumbled and would have fallen had not Ben sprung forward and held him up. \"Thank you, my boy,\" he said, in a tremulous voice. \"You seem feeble,\" said Ben compassionately. \"Yes, I am not strong.\" \"If you wish it I will accompany you to your house; you might fall again.\" \"What is your name?\" \"Benjamin Bradford.\" \"Where do you board?\" asked the old man abruptly. \"At No.—-Warren Avenue.\" \"I want to find a comfortable boarding-house. Do you think I could get in there?\" \"Yes, sir; I know Mrs. Draper has a vacant room.\" \"Is she reasonable in her charges?\" \"If she were not I could not afford to board there.\" \"I\u0027ve a great mind to go there,\" said the old man. \"I wonder if he has money enough to pay his board regularly,\" thought Ben. Just then a grandson of Mrs. Draper\u0027s, Charlie Hunting, a boy rather younger than Ben, came up. \"How are you, Ben?\" he said. \"All right, Charlie. Do you know if your grandmother has let the bedroom on the second floor?\" \"Yes, I know she hasn\u0027t.\" \"Would you like to go and see it, sir?\" asked Ben. \"Yes,\" said the old man. \"Is it far?\" \"About half a mile; but we can take the cars.\" \"No, I can walk, if you will walk slow enough for me. I am not so young as I was.\" \"Certainly, sir. Charlie, if you are going home, just tell your grandmother that this gentleman is coming to look at her room. You needn\u0027t wait for me.\" \"All right, Ben.\" \"You are very kind to an old man; what did you say your name was?\" \"Ben Bradford.\" \"Have you parents living?\" \"No, sir, only an aunt and cousin.\" \"Are they well off?\" \"Not very, sir. They got along very comfortably till lately, but now something has happened which makes me feel anxious. But I won\u0027t trouble you with it, sir.\" \"Tell me about it; I would like to hear it.\" \"For five years my aunt has occupied a small house, rent free. It belonged to her uncle. She has just got a letter saying that her uncle is dead, and demanding payment of rent for the last five years.\" \"What are you going to do about it?\" \"I have written to the lawyer, telling him on what terms my aunt occupied her house—that is, rent free, on condition that she paid the taxes regularly.\" \"What was the uncle\u0027s name? I am a little acquainted in Montreal. Perhaps I may have heard it.\" \"His name was Matthew Baldwin.\" \"I have heard of him. He was a miserly old man.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" said Ben. \"It seems to me you ought to look after the matter. Why don\u0027t you go to Montreal?\" \"I can\u0027t spare the time or money,\" answered Ben. \"Besides, we should certainly have heard of it if any property had been coming to us. I have written to the lawyer, and expect to hear something soon.\" When they reached the boarding-house on Warren Avenue the old man appeared pleased with the vacant room. He haggled a little about the terms, but finally agreed to take it at the price set by Mrs. Draper. He gave his name as Marcus Benton, and too immediate possession. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83569.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
