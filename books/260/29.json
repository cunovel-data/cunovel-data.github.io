{"id":7864,"no":29,"title":"Chapter XXIX — The Cunard Steamer","content":"Early one morning a gentleman came into Jones \u0026 Porter\u0027s bookstore, and selected some books, which he paid for. There were eighteen in all. \"Where shall we send them, sir?\" \"Can you send them to the Cunard steamer at East Boston? I sail for Europe today.\" \"Certainly, sir. When does the steamer start?\" \"At twelve o\u0027clock. Don\u0027t fail to have them there on time, as I shall be greatly disappointed to miss them.\" When the gentleman had left the store, Ben was summoned. \"Ben, do you know the Cunard Wharf in East Boston?\" asked the bookkeeper. \"I can easily find it.\" \"Here is a package of books to be carried there.\" \"All right, sir,\" said Ben. \"They are for Mr. James Parker. If you don\u0027t find him leave them with the steward.\" So Ben took the package, and made his way toward the East Boston Ferry. On board the boat he look around him, thinking it possible that he might recognize some one of his fellow passengers. Considerably to his surprise he noticed Mr. Archer, superintendent of the factory at Milltown, whom he had not seen since the latter declined to take him on again at the mill. \"I wonder what brings Mr. Archer here?\" His surprise, however, was only momentary. There was nothing strange in the superintendent\u0027s having business at East Boston. Ben noticed, however, that Mr. Archer wore a traveling-suit, and carried a knapsack. Ben would have liked to inquire if Squire Archer had seen his aunt lately, if they had been on friendly terms; but he was very doubtful how his advance would be received, and remained where he was. The boat touched the pier and the passengers disembarked. Ben was two or three rods behind the squire. Our hero inquired the way to the steamer, and had no difficulty about obtaining the necessary information. To his additional surprise Squire Archer crossed the gangway only a little in advance of Ben. \"What can be the squire\u0027s business here?\" thought Ben, in surprise. Ben halted on deck, and looked around for some officer to whom he could entrust the package. At this moment Squire Archer turned and saw Ben for the first time. He started and changed color, as Ben could see. For an instant he looked irresolute. Then he approached Ben, and said roughly: \"What brings you here?\" \"I am here on business,\" answered Ben. \"On business! What business?\" \"I have a package of books for one of the passengers.\" \"Oh, I see,\" said the mill superintendent, seeming to be relieved. \"You are working in a bookstore.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"What firm is it?\" \"Jones \u0026 Porter.\" \"Oh, yes, I know. I have often been in their store. How do you like your place?\" Squire Archer\u0027s tone was quite genial and friendly, though there was an uneasy expression on his face. \"Very well, sir.\" \"If you ever get out of a place, come to me.\" \"I thought you said my record was not good.\" \"So I did,\" said the superintendent; \"but I was mistaken. I was thinking of another boy at the time.\" \"I am glad to hear it, sir,\" he answered. \"I felt disturbed about it at the time.\" \"Of course. I believe you and Sam had a little difference.\" \"Yes, sir; but I don\u0027t think I was to blame.\" \"I don\u0027t care to inquire into that. You and Sam will laugh over it when you become a little older.\" Squire Archer had never seemed so kind and pleasant. Ben began to think he had misjudged him. \"I would like to be friends with Sam,\" he said. \"I shall be ready to meet him half-way.\" \"I will tell him so to-night,\" said the superintendent. \"By the way, I suppose you are rather surprised to see me here. You didn\u0027t think I was going to Europe?\" \"No, sir, I didn\u0027t think that. I suppose you couldn\u0027t be spared at the mill.\" \"Quite true, my boy. I can\u0027t be spared for so long. I wish I could. I have long wanted to make a European tour; but I am tied down at home by business. However, that doesn\u0027t explain why I am here.\" \"Don\u0027t tell me, sir, unless you like. It is none of my business.\" \"To be sure. In fact, there is a little secret about it; but I don\u0027t mind telling you.\" Ben felt more and more surprised. Was this the proud Squire Archer, who carried his head so high? \"If there is a secret about it, perhaps you had better not tell me,\" said Ben. \"Oh, I am quite willing to tell you; but you must not say anything about it till after the steamer has sailed. The fact is, a man, who owes the mill a large sum of money, it is suspected has taken passage on board this steamer, with the intention of going to Europe and evading the payment of his debt. I can\u0027t tell you his name, as that might interfere with my plans. I am here to intercept him, and prevent his departure.\" \"I hope you will succeed, Squire Archer,\" said Ben. \"Thank you, Ben. You see, therefore, that it is essential for me to keep my presence here secret till the steamer sails. I will go down-stairs now and watch.\" Ben delivered his parcel, left the steamer, and did not mention that he had met any one whom he knew. He felt bound to respect Squire Archer\u0027s secret. In the afternoon he was walking up Washington Street with the bookkeeper, when the latter bought the Evening Transcript. He glanced at the first page and then turned to Ben. \"Do you know Archer living in Milltown?\" \"Certainly; he is the superintendent of the mill there.\" \"Well, here is a paragraph about him. It seems he has left the town, with fifty thousand dollars belonging to the corporation. His flight has made a great sensation. The police are on his track, and it is thought that he will be arrested and brought back.\" \"I saw Squire Archer this morning, on the Cunard steamer. He told me not to mention having seen him till after the steamer had started.\" \"Is it possible?\" exclaimed young Porter. \"Yes; he said he was looking out for a man who owed money to the mill, whom he suspected of taking secret passage for Europe.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83566.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
