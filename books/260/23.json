{"id":7858,"no":23,"title":"Chapter XXIII — The Decoy Letter","content":"Sam knew that Ben was anxious to obtain a situation. It occurred to him that it would be a splendid joke to write to Ben, in the name of some Boston firm, offering him a situation. Ben would go up to the city, of course, only to find that he had been \"sold.\" Of course, it would not do for Sam to write the letter himself, since his writing was well known to Ben. Again, the letter must be posted in Boston. However, where there is a will there is a way. Sam was acquainted with a boy who lived in Boston—Frank Ferguson—and to him he wrote, enclosing the draft of a letter, which he requested Frank to copy and mail to Ben. \"It is only a practical joke,\" Sam explained in his letter, \"in return for one Ben has played on me.\" But for this explanation, Frank who was an honorable boy, would not have lent himself to this scheme. As it was, it struck him only as a piece of fun, and he followed Sam\u0027s instructions. A few days later, Ben, in going to the post-office, received a letter directed to himself. It read thus: \"BENJAMIN BRADFORD: We are in want of a boy in our store. You can have the place if you wish. It will be necessary for you to report for duty next Monday. \"Yours, in haste, \"JONES \u0026 PORTER\" Ben had heard of Jones \u0026 Porter. They were well-known booksellers and publishers. A position with them was certainly desirable. \"But how could they have heard of me,\" thought Ben. He was not vain enough to suppose that his name was well known in Boston, yet here was an important firm that had offered him employment. Again, the manner in which the letter ended struck him as rather singular. It didn\u0027t occur to Ben to doubt its genuineness. As he was walking back, he met James Watson. \"What\u0027s the news, Ben?\" asked James. \"I am offered a place in Boston,\" answered Ben. \"You don\u0027t say so! What sort of place is it?\" \"It is a place in a bookstore. There is the letter.\" James read it. \"How did they happen to write to you.\" \"I don\u0027t know, I am sure.\" \"Can\u0027t you think of any way in which they could have heard of you?\" \"There is only one way I can think of. There was a gentleman in Charleston who was quite kind to me when I was there last year. He promised to be of service to me if I ever needed it. He may have mentioned my name to Jones \u0026 Porter. \"Very likely,\" said James. \"You are in luck.\" \"I wish I knew what wages they are willing to pay,\" said Ben. \"If it\u0027s only five dollars a week, it won\u0027t more than pay my board, and I don\u0027t like to call upon Aunt Jane to pay for my clothes.\" \"You will take the place, won\u0027t you, at any rate?\" \"Oh, yes. Perhaps I can get a chance to earn something by extra work, and so pay for my clothes.\" \"Well, I wish you good luck, Ben. If you hear of a place for me, let me know.\" \"I will, James. I should like your company.\" Ben went home and showed the letter to his aunt. \"You see, aunt, I am provided for,\" said Ben. Old Mrs. Perkins was present and hazarded a cheerful observation. \"I wouldn\u0027t trust a boy of mine in the city, Mrs. Bradford,\" she said; \"it\u0027s the ruination of \u0027em most always. Like or not, Ben will get dissipated, and take to drinkin\u0027, and have the delirious triangles.\" Mrs. Bradford was easily alarmed. \"Do you think you\u0027d better go, Ben?\" she asked doubtfully. \"You\u0027re so young.\" \"I can\u0027t afford to wait till I\u0027m an old man, Aunt Jane,\" he said; \"and I don\u0027t mean to have the \u0027delirous triangles,\u0027 if I can help it. You wouldn\u0027t keep me at home till I\u0027m eighty, like Mrs. Perkins———-\" \"I\u0027m only sixty-two,\" exclaimed the old lady indignantly. \"What do you mean by calling me eighty?\" \"I didn\u0027t know you were sensitive about your age.\" \"I ain\u0027t,\" snarled the old lady; \"I own up to sixty-two, but you needn\u0027t call me twenty years older.\" Mrs. Perkins was really seventy-two and looked her age; but she fondly hoped to deceive the public. \"Do you really think you had better go to Boston, Ben?\" said his aunt, after the departure of the visitor. \"Yes, Aunt Jane. There\u0027s no chance for me in Milltown, as you know very well. Mr. Archer\u0027s prejudiced against me, and won\u0027t take me into the mill.\" \"I shall miss you very much, Ben.\" \"I\u0027ll write you once every week.\" \"How much will you get?\" \"I don\u0027t know. If it\u0027s too little, I will live as closely as I can. I shall be learning the business, you know, and, of course, I shall get my salary raised when I deserve it.\" Ben had a strong, positive nature, and he convinced his aunt that he ought to accept the offer of Jones \u0026 Porter. Mrs. Bradford set about putting his clothes in order. Sam Archer awaited with interest the result of his joke. Seeing Ben the next day, he stopped him. \"Where are you bound, Ben?\" he asked. \"I am going to buy some underclothes,\" he said. \"Have you got a place?\" \"Yes, I expect so.\" Sam wanted to laugh, but concealed his emotions. \"Where is it?\" he asked. \"It isn\u0027t in you father\u0027s mill,\" retorted Ben. \"No, I suppose not. Is it in town?\" \"It is in Boston!\" said Ben, in a tone of satisfaction. Sam laughed involuntarily. \"What are you laughing at?\" inquired Ben angrily. \"Excuse me,\" said Sam. \"I was thinking how green you would be at first in a city place. I will call and see you when I go to the city.\" \"I don\u0027t like to be impolite; but as you prevented my getting a place here, I don\u0027t look upon you as a friend, and I only care to receive calls from my friends.\" \"How proud we are just because we have got a place in Boston!\" said Sam mockingly, and he laughed again. \"I thought he would be disappointed to hear of my success,\" thought Ben. \"He is rather a queer boy.\" \"Isn\u0027t it jolly?\" said Sam to himself. \"Won\u0027t he be mad when he finds it all a sell?\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83560.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
