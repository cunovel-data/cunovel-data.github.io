I guess I was born sleepy.\" \"You look so,\" retorted Bed, with a laugh. \"What have you been doing?\" inquired James lazily. \"I\u0027ve been about in search of a place.\" \"You have!\" said James, with sudden interest. \"Did you find any?\" \"Yes, I found three.\" \"What!\" exclaimed James, in surprise. \"I was offered three places.\" \"Which did you take?\" \"I didn\u0027t take any; I didn\u0027t like them.\" \"You are too particular, Ben. Just tell me where they are; I\u0027ll accept one.\" \"All right!\" said Ben. \"I\u0027ll give you all the information you require. The first is a dry-goods store.\" \"I\u0027d like to be in a dry-goods store. What\u0027s the pay?\" \"Fifty cents a week for the first year.\" \"Faugh!\" ejaculated James, disgusted. \"What\u0027s the second place?\" \"Experiment clerk at the druggist\u0027s.\" \"Good pay?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"What are the duties?\" \"To taste all the medicines, to make sure there\u0027s no poison in them. The druggist offered me a pill, to begin with, about as large as my head.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t take it for a hundred dollars a week. What\u0027s the third?\" \"In a cigar store. The pay is three dollars a week.\" \"That\u0027s better than nothing. Where is it? I guess I\u0027ll take it.\" \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll like the duties,\" said Ben, laughing. \"I wouldn\u0027t mind selling cigars.\" \"That isn\u0027t what you\u0027re wanted for. You are to be painted red, and stand outside as an Indian.\" \"That\u0027s the worst yet. I don\u0027t wonder you didn\u0027t take any of those chances. What are you going to do this afternoon?\" \"Try and find some more places.\" \"Leave that till tomorrow. You know there\u0027s going to be a big picnic at Lovell\u0027s Grounds, with all sorts of athletic sports. There are prizes for wrestling, jumping, and so on.\" \"I would like it well enough, but I can\u0027t afford to go.\" \"There\u0027ll be nothing to pay. Father subscribed for two tickets, so I\u0027ve got a spare one. Come, will you go?\" \"Yes, I will, and thank you.\" \"Then come round to the house as soon as you\u0027ve got through dinner.\" \"All right! I\u0027ll come.\" \"I suppose you haven\u0027t found a place?\" said Mrs. Bradford when Ben entered. \"Not yet.\" \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to become of us if you don\u0027t,\" said Aunt Jane mournfully. \"Don\u0027t get discouraged so quick, aunt. I\u0027ve only been looking round one forenoon. Besides, I\u0027ve been offered a place, and declined it.\" \"Declined it! What could you have been thinking of?\" Ben then told his aunt of the place at the druggist\u0027s. He thought he would not mention the others. \"If you\u0027d taken it, we might have got our medicine cheaper,\" said Aunt Jane, who did not comprehend a joke, and understood the offer literally. \"I should have got mine for nothing,\" said Ben, laughing, \"and more than I wanted, too.\" \"What pay would you get?\" \"I didn\u0027t ask. The first pill the druggist offered me was too much for me. So I respectfully declined the position.\" \"Pills are excellent for the constitution,\" said Mrs. Bradford, in a rather reproachful tone. \"I never could get you to take them, Benjamin. Some day you\u0027ll lose your life, perhaps, because you are so set against them.\" \"I can\u0027t say I hanker after them, aunt,\" said Ben good humoredly. \"However, you see, I might have had a place, so you mustn\u0027t get discouraged so quick.\" \"Will you stay at home this afternoon, Ben?\" asked little Tony. \"I can\u0027t Tony; I have an engagement with James Watson. Aunt Jane, if I am late to supper, don\u0027t be frightened.\" Ben found James ready and waiting. They set out at once. Lovell\u0027s Grounds were situated a mile and a half away; they comprised several acres, sloping down to a pond, which was provided with pleasure boats. The grounds were frequently hired by parties from neighboring towns, having been fitted up especially for the enjoyment of a crowd. To-day they were engaged by a young people\u0027s association, and the program included, among other things, some athletic sports. The grounds were pretty well filled when the two boys arrived. In fact, the performance had already commenced. \"You\u0027re just in time for the fun, boys,\" said George Herman, a mutual acquaintance, coming up to meet them. \"Why, what\u0027s up George?\" \"There is to be a fat man\u0027s race of two hundred yards, for a prize of five dollars.\" \"Who are going to enter?\" \"Tom Hayden, the landlord of the Milltown House, and Jim Morrison, the tailor. One weighs two hundred and fifty, the other two hundred and forty-three.\" \"Good!\" laughed Ben. \"That will be fun. Where do they start from?\" \"There! Don\u0027t you see that chalk-mark? And there come the men.\" There was a level track laid out, extending two hundred yards, which was used for such occasions, and this was one of the attractive features of Lovell\u0027s Grounds. The two men advanced to the starting-line, each accoutered for the race. They had divested themselves of their coats, and stood in shirt-sleeves, breathing hard already, in anticipation of the race. Their bulky forms appeared to great advantage, and excited considerable amusement. Tom Hayden, who was rather the heavier of the two, had encircled his waist with a leather strap, which confined it almost as closely as a young lady\u0027s waist. This was by advice of Frank Jones, a young fellow noted as a runner. \"I don\u0027t think I can stand it, Frank,\" said Hayden, gasping for breath. \"Oh, yes, you can, Mr. Hayden. You\u0027ll see how it will help you.\" \"I can hardly breathe. You\u0027ve got it too tight.\" Frank Jones loosened it a little, and then turned to Morrison. \"Won\u0027t you have a girdle, too, Mr. Morrison?\" he asked. \"Not much. I don\u0027t want to be suffocated before I start. Have you made your will, Hayden?\" \"Not yet, I will make it after I have won the prize.\" \"Are you ready, gentlemen?\" asked Frank Jones, who officiated as starter. \"As ready as I ever expect to be,\" answered Hayden, trying to draw a long breath, and failing. \"Then, start at the word three. One! Two! Three!\" Amid shouts of applause, the two fat men started. It cannot be said they started like arrows from the bow, but they certainly exerted themselves uncommonly. Their faces grew red with the efforts they made, and their colossal legs hurried over the ground as fast as could reasonably be expected. \"I could beat them easily,\" said James Watson. \"Of course you could. Just wait till you\u0027ve got as much to carry. Look! there\u0027s Morrison down!\" It was true. Somehow one of Morrison\u0027s legs entangled with the other, and he tumbled and rolled over and over. \"Go in and win, Hayden!\" shouted fifty voices to his gasping competitor. About seventy-five yards remained to be traversed. It look as if Hayden could win the race with opposition. But he was quite out of breath. He pressed both hands on his stomach, stopped, and deliberately sat down on the track. \"Don\u0027t give it up!\" yelled the crowd. \"Keep on, and the prize is yours!\" \"I can\u0027t,\" gasped Hayden, \"and I wouldn\u0027t for five times the prize. I don\u0027t want it.\" So the prize was not awarded, but the crowd had their fun, and the two fat competitors sat down together to rest under a tree. They did not recover from their efforts for at least an hour. \"Is there to be a boys\u0027 race?\" asked Ben. \"Yes, the boys\u0027 race is next in order. You\u0027d better enter.\" \"I will,\" said Ben. \"What\u0027s the prize?\" \"Five dollars.\" Ben\u0027s eyes sparkled. \"If I could only win it,\" he thought, \"it would be equal to a week\u0027s pay at the factory.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83540.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
