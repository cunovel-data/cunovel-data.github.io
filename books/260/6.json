{"id":7841,"no":6,"title":"Chapter VI — Mr. Dobson\u0027s Visit","content":"It was a little after five o\u0027clock when Ben entered his humble home. He was in excellent spirits, as may be imagined. His aunt\u0027s face, however, presented a decided contrast to his own. \"Well, Benjamin,\" she said, with a sigh, \"I suppose you haven\u0027t found anything to do.\" \"No, Aunt Jane, I have been to a picnic.\" \"I don\u0027t see how you can have the spirits to go to a picnic when we are on the verge of starvation,\" said Mrs. Bradford reproachfully. \"Not so bad as that, Aunt Jane; we won\u0027t starve this week, anyway.\" \"Perhaps not; but I look forward to the future.\" \"So do I, Aunt Jane,\" Ben replied; \"but there is this difference between us. You look forward with discouragement, while I look forward hopefully. You know my motto is, Wait and Hope!\" \"You\u0027ll have plenty of waiting to do,\" his aunt retorted; \"but there isn\u0027t much to hope for.\" \"Why isn\u0027t there?\" \"I shouldn\u0027t think you\u0027d need to be told. You haven\u0027t earned a cent to-day, and——\" \"How do you know I haven\u0027t?\" demanded Ben, smiling. \"How could you? You were going about this morning after a place, and this afternoon you have been at a picnic.\" \"For all that, aunt, I have earned something—more than if I had been at the factory.\" Mrs. Bradford stared at Ben in astonishment. \"How much did you earn, Ben?\" asked Tony. \"Haven\u0027t I done well enough to earn a dollar, Tony?\" Mrs. Bradford\u0027s face assumed a more cheerful look, for a dollar in that little household would go far. \"I don\u0027t see how you found time to earn so much, Benjamin,\" she said. \"Now, just suppose, aunt, that I earned two dollars,\" said Ben, with a merry twinkle in his eyes. This was too much for his aunt to believe. \"If supposing would make it so, I should be very glad to suppose; but it won\u0027t.\" \"But it\u0027s true, aunt.\" \"I can\u0027t believe it, Benjamin, unless you\u0027ve found the money somewhere, and then you will have to return it.\" \"No, I earned it, Aunt Jane, and it\u0027s mine fairly.\" \"I am glad to hear it, Benjamin. Is there any chance to earn any more the same way?\" \"I am afraid not, Aunt Jane. However, I\u0027ve done even better than I told you. I\u0027ve earned ten dollars this afternoon.\" \"Benjamin Bradford!\" said his aunt sharply. \"Do you expect me to believe such a foolish story as that?\" Ben laughed, He was not surprised at his aunt\u0027s incredulity; he wouldn\u0027t have believed that morning that there was any chance of his making so much money. \"I don\u0027t know as I blame you, Aunt Jane; but if you won\u0027t believe me, perhaps you\u0027ll believe your own eyes,\" answered Ben, as he drew forth the two five-dollar bills from his pocket, and showed them to Mrs. Bradford. \"Are they good?\" she asked suspiciously. \"As good as gold, Aunt Jane; well, not exactly as good as gold, but as good as greenbacks, anyway.\" \"I can\u0027t understand it at all,\" said Mrs. Bradford, in helpless bewilderment. \"Then I\u0027ll tell you all about it,\" said Ben; and he did so. \"I shall have a high opinion of my legs from this time,\" he concluded, \"for they have earned ten dollars in quicker time than my hands can earn twenty-five cents.\" Even his aunt, in spite of her despondent mood, could not help being cheerful over such good fortune as that. \"You see, Aunt Jane, that even if I don\u0027t earn anything for the next two weeks, we shall be as well off as if I had been working at the factory all the time. So don\u0027t worry any more till that time has passed.\" \"You certainly have been very fortunate, Benjamin,\" Mrs. Bradford was forced to admit. A copious rain is very apt to be followed by a protracted drought, and I am sorry to say that this was the case with Ben\u0027s luck. Day after day he went about Milltown, seeking for employment, and night after night he returned home disappointed and empty-handed. If it had depended only on himself, his courage would still have kept up; but his aunt\u0027s dismal forebodings affected his spirits. He did not find it quite so easy to wait and hope as he anticipated. Three weeks passed, and Ben was painfully sensible that there was but a dollar in the house. They had just risen from the dinner table on the day when their fortunes were at so low an ebb, when a knock was heard at the door. A man of about thirty-five, Mr. Jotham Dobson, was admitted. Mr. Dobson was a man with a brisk, business-like air. \"Won\u0027t you come in, Mr. Dobson?\" asked Ben, who had answered the knock. \"Is your aunt at home?\" inquired Mr. Dobson bruskly. \"Yes, sir.\" \"Then, I\u0027ll step in a minute, as I want to see her on business.\" \"What business can he possibly have?\" thought Ben. \"I wish his business lay with me, and that he wanted to employ me.\" \"Good morning, Mrs. Bradford,\" said Dobson rapidly. \"No, thank you, I really haven\u0027t the time to sit down; I have a little business with you, that\u0027s all.\" \"Perhaps he wants to get me to do some sewing,\" thought Mrs. Bradford; but she was doomed to be disagreeably disappointed. \"Perhaps you are not aware of it,\" said Mr. Dobson, \"but I am the city collector of taxes. I\u0027ve got your tax bill made out. Let me see—here it is. Will it be convenient for you to pay it to-day?\" \"How much is it?\" faltered Mrs. Bradford. \"Eleven dollars and eighty cents, precisely,\" answered the collector. Mrs. Bradford looked so doleful that Ben felt called upon to reply. \"We can\u0027t pay it this morning, Mr. Dobson,\" he said. \"Really, you had better make the effort,\" said Dobson. \"You are aware that the tax is now due, and that one per cent a month will be added for default. That\u0027s twelve per cent, a year—pretty heavy.\" \"What shall we do, Benjamin?\" asked his aunt, in a crushed tone. \"Wait and hope, Aunt Jane.\" \"My friends,\" said Mr. Dobson persuasively, \"I really think you\u0027d better make the effort to pay now, and so avoid the heavy interest.\" \"Perhaps,\" said Ben, \"you\u0027ll tell us how to pay without money?\" \"You might borrow it.\" \"All right! I am willing. Mr. Dobson will you be kind enough to lend us twelve dollars to meet this bill?\" Mr. Dobson\u0027s face changed. It always did when any one proposed to borrow money of him, for he was what people called a \"close\" man. \"I really couldn\u0027t do it,\" he answered. \"Money\u0027s very scarce with me—particularly scarce. It\u0027s all I can do to pay my own taxes.\" Ben smiled to himself, for he knew how the application would be answered. \"Then of course we can\u0027t pay at present,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve tried to borrow, and can\u0027t.\" \"I didn\u0027t expect you\u0027d try to borrow of me—the tax collector,\" said Dobson; \"even if I had the money, it would be very unprofessional of me to lend you the money.\" \"It would be very unprofessional of us to pay you without money,\" returned Ben. \"I suppose I must call again,\" said the collector, disappointed. He was disappointed less for the city than for his own account, for he received a percentage on taxes collected. \"I suppose you must.\" \"Benjamin, this is awful,\" said Mrs. Bradford piteously, after Mr. Dobson had retired. \"What is going to become of us? The city will sell the house for taxes.\" \"They\u0027ll wait a year first, at any rate, Aunt Jane; so we won\u0027t fret about it yet. There are other things more pressing.\" \"If we don\u0027t get some money within a day or two, we must starve, Benjamin.\" \"Something may turn up this afternoon, Aunt Jane. Wait and hope!\" Ben put on his hat and went out. In spite of his cheerful answer, he felt rather sober himself. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83543.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
