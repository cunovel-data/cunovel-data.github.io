{"id":7849,"no":14,"title":"Chapter XIV — Prof. Crane, The Phrenologist","content":"After supper Ben and his young charge took their seats in the main salon. The passengers were grouped about the tables, many of them reading the New York evening papers. Among them Ben observed a tall man, wearing a full beard, and attired in a suit of rather rusty black, who presently sat down beside him. From his appearance Ben fancied that he might be a clergyman or a missionary. \"My young friend,\" said the stranger at length, \"are you traveling to Boston?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Ahem! Do you live in Boston?\" \"No, sir; I live in Milltown, a manufacturing town.\" \"Did you ever have your head examined?\" Ben stared at the questioner in surprise. \"What should I have my head examined for?\" he asked. \"I see you don\u0027t understand me,\" said the gentlemen of clerical appearance. \"I am a phrenologist.\" \"Oh, yes, I understand,\" said Ben. \"I lecture on phrenology and examine heads, describing the character and prominent traits of my subjects on phrenological principles. For instance, I can readily tell by the help of my science your leading tendencies, and in what career you would be most likely to meet with success.\" \"I would like to know that myself,\" said Ben, becoming interested. \"My terms for an ordinary examination are twenty-five cents. For a written description I charge a dollar.\" \"If I had plenty of money,\" said Ben, \"I wouldn\u0027t mind getting a written description.\" \"A dollar spent that way may save you hundreds of dollars, nay, perhaps thousands,\" said the phrenologist insinuatingly. Ben shook his head. \"I haven\u0027t any money to spare,\" he said. \"I have some money, but it was given to me to pay traveling expenses.\" \"Surely you can spare twenty-five cents,\" said the phrenologist. \"You can remember what I say and write it down yourself afterward.\" \"So, I can,\" said Ben. \"I guess I can afford a quarter; but where can we go?\" \"Stay here,\" said Prof. Crane, for this was his self-chosen designation. \"It will probably bring me other customers.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Ben, looking about him doubtfully. \"I don\u0027t think I should like to have all these people hear about me.\" \"You need not be afraid. You have a very good heard. Besides, it is no more public than at my lectures.\" \"All right then!\" \"Move your chair forward a little. There, that is right.\" Prof. Crane arose, and assumed the attitude of a speaker. \"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he commenced, after clearing his throat. The gentlemen in the saloon looked up from their newspapers in some surprise at this unexpected interruption. \"Ladies and gentlemen, I am Prof. Crane, the phrenologist. I trust you will pardon the interruption if I publically examine the head of this young man, and describe his character as indicated by his phrenological development.\" \"Go on,\" said a stout gentlemen opposite. \"It will help to pass the time.\" \"Thank you, sir. I trust that what I may say will not only help to pass the time, but lead you to reflect seriously upon the great importance of this science, and its claims upon your attention.\" All eyes were turned upon Ben, who bore the ordeal very well. \"This lad has an excellent head. All the organs are well balanced, none being in great excess. His temperament is nervous-sanguine. Hope predominates with him. He will not be easily discouraged, but when he has an object in view he will pursue it perseveringly to the end. He is not quarrelsome, but will not allow himself to be trodden upon. He has plenty of courage. He is not bashful, but respectful to his elders and superiors. He is conscientious, and more likely to do right than wrong. Of course he might yield to temptation, but it would have to be a powerful one. He has a fondness for pets, and will be kind to younger children. He will find no pleasure in ill-treating or tyrannizing over them He has not much invention, and would make a poor machinist, but is likely to succeed in general business. He will probably be steady and reliable, and faithful to the interests of his employer.\" This was the substance of Prof. Crane\u0027s description of our hero. Ben listened with satisfaction, feeling that it was a very good character indeed. He was sorry that some business man could not hear it, as it might lead him to offer him employment. When the examination was over, Ben tendered the professor twenty-five cents in payment. \"Now,\" said the professor, looking around him, \"is there any other lady or gentleman whose head I can examine, for the small sum of twenty-five cents? My usual terms are fifty cents, but as I am traveling, and this is out of office hours, I don\u0027t mind reducing the price for this occasion.\" Among those present was a rustic couple, who appeared to be on a wedding trip. The bridegroom was dressed in a full suit of blue cloth, the coat being decorated with brass buttons, while the bride was resplendent in a dress brilliant in color and with large figures. \"Sally,\" said the young husband, \"I want you to have your head examined. It only costs a quarter.\" \"Oh, Jonathan, how can I before all them folks?\" said Sally bashfully. \"Suppose he should say something bad about me.\" \"If he does, I\u0027ll bu\u0027st his head,\" said Jonathan. \"He can\u0027t say nothin\u0027 but what\u0027s good about you, Sally. \"All right, Jonathan, just as you say.\" \"My wife will have her head examined,\" said Jonathan, with a proud glance at his radiant bride. \"Please sit here, madam,\" said the professor. \"Now I will trouble you to remove your bonnet.\" \"Don\u0027t tumble up my hair,\" said Sally solicitously. \"That will not be necessary,\" said Prof. Crane. \"This lady has a very harmonious head.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" inquired Sally, in a low voice, of Jonathan, who stood at her side. \"Something good, I reckon,\" whispered her husband. \"She has those sweet domestic virtues which fit the possessor to adorn the family circle and lend a luster to the home.\" \"How nice he talks!\" murmured Sally, in a tone of gratification. \"Yes, Sally, he\u0027s smart,\" said Jonathan, \"and can read you like a book.\" \"This lady has a great taste for music. She would be like to excel as a musician. Am I right, sir?\" \"I guess you are,\" said Jonathan. \"You\u0027d ought to hear her sing in the choir to hum. She\u0027s got a powerful voice, Sally has. She can almost raise the rafters of the old meetin\u0027-house.\" \"You see, ladies and gentlemen, that the husband of the lady confirms what I say of her. Phrenology never errs. A phrenologist is never mistaken in character. Nature has stamped her impress upon each one of us, and declares unmistakably what we are.\" \"Go ahead, professor,\" said Jonathan impatiently. \"The lady has a taste for strong and decided colors. What is showy attracts her admiration.\" \"That\u0027s so!\" commented Jonathan. \"She has a good deal of firmness, and likes to have her own way; as most of use do,\" added the professor. \"Still she would yield to strong persuasion.\" It will be unnecessary to go farther in the examination which proved quite satisfactory to the young couple, and a source of amusement to the rest of the passengers. Jonathan next submitted himself to the professor\u0027s skill, and was highly delighted in being told that he was fitted to shine in public life, and might hereafter become a member of Congress. \"I guess the folks at home will think more of me when they hear that,\" he remarked to Sally. \"The professor has given us good characters.\" \"So he has. Do you think it\u0027s all true, Jonathan?\" \"Of course it is. It\u0027s a wonderful science, Sally. I didn\u0027t know I had so many bumps.\" \"Nor I. I can\u0027t feel \u0027em myself.\" \"That\u0027s because you\u0027re not used to it. It takes the professor to do it.\" Other subjects were forthcoming, and the professor cleared three dollars during the evening. He understood human nature well enough to flatter all, without absolutely contradicting the science of which he claimed to be the exponent.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83551.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
