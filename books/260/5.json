{"id":7840,"no":5,"title":"Chapter V — Ben Wins Again","content":"\"I am very glad you won,\" said Frank Jones, in a low voice. \"Thank you; so am I,\" answered Ben, smiling. \"Of course I should have preferred to win myself,\" continued Frank candidly; \"but, as I saw that it lay between you and John Miles, I sided with you.\" \"Do you know Miles?\" \"No, but I spoke with him just as the race began. I saw that he felt sure of winning. He boasted that he had practiced running at a gymnasium in Boston.\" \"Then I wonder he didn\u0027t beat me.\" \"He would on a short race; but your wind is better.\" \"I am glad to win, for the sake of the money,\" said Ben. \"I have lost my place at the factory, and my aunt depends on my earnings.\" \"Then I am glad for you,\" said Frank. \"I didn\u0027t need the money myself. If I had won, I would have given it to you, knowing your circumstances.\" \"You are very kind,\" said Ben gratefully. \"You may win another five dollars. I hope you will.\" \"It will be rather hard on John Miles to lose two races and his money, too.\" \"You needn\u0027t consider that. If I judge him rightly, he has self-conceit enough to carry him through a dozen defeats. He will have some excuse ready, you may be sure. He says he lost the first race by a sudden cramp. He has not more cramp than I.\" \"There are little boys in line,\" said Ben. \"I recognize Frank and Charlie Herman. Do you know the others?\" \"I know nearly all. Next to Charlie Herman are Aleck Gale, Johnny Clarke, little Vanderhoef, Brooks Gulager, and Charlie Boyd. The end boy is Charlie Snedeker.\" \"Who will win?\" \"One of the Hermans, probably.\" The prediction proved correct. Charles Herman can in first, leading his brother by a few feet. \"You ought to divide the prize with me, Charlie,\" said Frank. \"I didn\u0027t like to beat my older brother, or I would have run ahead of you.\" \"You didn\u0027t seem to hold back much,\" said Charlie. \"However, I will be generous and give you a dollar. It will be all in the family.\" Proclamation was now made that a supplementary race would be run, for a prize of five dollars, offered by John Miles, the contestants being John Miles and Ben Bradford. The distance by request of Miles, was diminished to two hundred yards. John was shrewd enough to see that the shorter distance was more favorable to himself. Defeat had not diminished his good opinion of himself, not increased his respect for Ben. \"You gained the race by an accident,\" he said to Ben, as they stood side by side, waiting for the signal. \"Perhaps I did,\" replied Ben good-humoredly; \"all I can say is that it was a lucky accident for me.\" \"Of course it was. You don\u0027t think you can run as fast as I can?\" \"I can\u0027t tell yet. I will do my best.\" \"You will have to. I have practiced running in a Boston gymnasium.\" \"Then you have the advantage of me.\" \"Of course I have. Besides, I am taller than you.\" \"For all that, I mean to win your five dollars if I can.\" \"My money is safe enough. I don\u0027t concern myself about that.\" \"He has a tolerably comfortable opinion of himself,\" thought Ben; \"I begin to want to beat him for something else than the money.\" The signal was given, and the boys started. As in the first race, John Miles soon took the lead. He was nearly three inches taller than Ben. Naturally, his legs were longer, and this was an advantage. Again he put forth all his strength at once; Ben, on the other hand, reserved his strength for the close of the contest. When the race was half over, John Miles was probably twenty feet in advance. \"Boston, will win this time,\" said Arthur Clark. \"See how much Miles leads.\" \"I am not so sure of that,\" said George Herman. \"I know Ben Bradford. He is very strong, and can hold out well. Miles is using himself up. Do you see how he is panting?\" This was true. In spite of all his training, John Miles had never been able to overcome a shortness of breath which was constitutional with him. It was telling upon him now. Foot by foot Ben gained upon him. It was the first race over again. Toward the finish he overtook him, and a final spurt won the race—with John Miles full ten feet behind. \"Have I won fairly?\" asked our her, turning to John. \"That confounded cramp caught me again,\" said John sullenly. \"If it hadn\u0027t been for that, you couldn\u0027t have beaten me.\" \"That was unlucky for you.\" \"I could beat you by twenty-five yards if I felt all right.\" \"Boasting is easy,\" thought Ben, but he did not say it. He felt in too good humor over his second victory. \"We may have a chance to run again some time when you are in better condition,\" he said cheerfully. \"Maybe so,\" answered John dubiously. He felt that he had had enough of running against Ben. Ben\u0027s acquaintances gathered about him, and congratulated him over his double victory. Boys whom he did not know sought an introduction, and he found himself quite a lion. John Miles returned to the two boys who had accompanied him, and began to apologize for his want of success. \"I was awfully unlucky,\" he said. \"I suppose that fellow thinks, because he has beaten me twice when I had the cramp, that he is a better runner than I am. Just see those fellows crowding around him! I suppose he will strut like a turkey-cock.\" But this was doing injustice to Ben. He certainly had reason to feel pleased with his success; for it not only brought him a sum equal to two weeks\u0027 wages at the factory, but he received the congratulations of the boys so modestly that he won the good opinion of many who had hitherto been strangers to him. \"By George, Ben, you\u0027ve done well,\" said James Watson. \"I just wish I were in your place.\" \"I owe my good luck to you, James.\" \"How is that?\" \"You invited me to come here. I shouldn\u0027t have come but for you.\" \"I am glad of it, Ben. From what you tell me, the money\u0027ll come in handy.\" \"Indeed it will, James.\" \"It would come in handy to me, too, but you need it more.\" Ben was summoned before the committee of the picnic, and asked whether he preferred to take his prizes in money or in the form of a gold medal. \"In money,\" he said promptly. \"The medal would always remind you of your victory.\" \"They wouldn\u0027t receive it at a grocery store,\" said Ben. \"Then you are a family man?\" said a member of the committee, smiling. \"Yes,\" said Ben; \"I\u0027ve got an aunt and cousin to provide for.\" The money was accordingly placed in his hands. Two five-dollar greenbacks were a rich reward for his afternoon\u0027s exertions, he thought. \"I wish I could earn as much money every day,\" he thought. \"We would have no trouble then about getting along.\" About half-past four o\u0027clock, Ben and James left the picnic grounds, and started on their way home. They had occasion to pass the cigar store where Ben had been offered employment. The proprietor was standing at the door. \"Have you made up your mind to accept my offer?\" he asked recognizing Ben. \"You don\u0027t offer enough,\" said Ben. \"Isn\u0027t three dollars a week enough for a boy like you?\" \"Since I last saw you I\u0027ve earned ten dollars,\" answered Ben. \"You have!\" exclaimed the cigar dealer, in surprise. \"I believe you are deceiving me. You don\u0027t expect me to believe a story like that.\" \"There is the proof,\" said Ben, displaying the greenbacks. \"Are you sure you haven\u0027t stolen the money?\" asked the dwarf suspiciously. \"I am as sure as that you are no gentleman,\" retorted Ben, nettled by his tone. The cigar dealer began to jump up and down with rage, and shook his fist violently at the two boys, who retired laughing. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83542.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
