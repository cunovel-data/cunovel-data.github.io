{"id":7855,"no":20,"title":"Chapter XX — Before the Battle","content":"Ben\u0027s term at school had already extended to eight months. Our hero was thorough in whatever he did, and, having an excellent natural capacity, easily took high rank as a scholar. \"Do you expect to win the prize, Ben?\" asked his friend, James Watson. \"I hope to win it,\" said Ben. \"So does Sam Archer.\" \"I suppose it lies between us two, unless you step in and carry it off,\" added Ben, smiling, for he knew that James, who was low in rank, was not at all sensitive on the subject. \"Make yourself easy, Ben; I won\u0027t interfere with you. You are my friend, you know, and for your sake I will answer a few questions wrong.\" \"You always were considerate, James. You have relieved my mind of a load of anxiety.\" \"Don\u0027t mention it, Ben. I shan\u0027t feel the sacrifice.\" \"You are a good fellow, at any rate, James, and that is more than I can say for Sam Archer.\" \"He thinks an awful lot of himself.\" \"He can\u0027t forget that his father is superintendent of the mill.\" \"By the way, Ben, what are you intending to do in vacation.\" \"I shall try to get employment in the mill again. I have been idle nearly a year now.\" \"Your aunt has been getting along very well.\" \"Yes; thanks to the seven dollars a week received for Emma\u0027s board. But I don\u0027t like to feel that she is supporting the family. I think it is high time for me to be at work.\" \"Ben, I\u0027ve been thinking of something.\" \"Out with it, James.\" \"Sam Archer will be very much disappointed if you take the prize over him.\" \"He doesn\u0027t love me overmuch now.\" \"I am afraid he will prejudice his father against you, so as to induce him to refuse you employment in the mill.\" \"Do you think he would be as mean as that?\" \"Do I think so? I know it. Sam Archer is mean enough for anything.\" \"He has just as good a chance as I have.\" \"He told one of the boys you were Mr. Taylor\u0027s pet. He will say the prize was give to you on account of favoritism.\" \"Will anybody believe it?\" \"No one except Sam\u0027s special friends. I think Mr. Taylor does like you. That reminds me, where do you think Mr. Taylor is to-night?\" \"I don\u0027t know, I am sure.\" \"He is dining at Mr. Archer\u0027s.\" \"That\u0027s something new, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Mr. Archer is trying to curry favor with the principal for Sam.\" \"Then he doesn\u0027t know him very well. Mr. Taylor will decide justly, at any rate.\" \"Do you want very much to go back to the mill, Ben?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then the best thing you can do is to let Sam beat you. That will make him good-natured and you will probably get a place.\" \"I shan\u0027t resign the prize. I shall do my best to obtain it. If that loses me employment in the mill, I will go in search of employment elsewhere.\" \"I like your pluck, Ben.\" \"I am willing to wait and I expect to win in the end.\" \"Well, good luck to you, Ben. My supper is ready, and I must go home.\" The more Ben thought it over, the more he felt that James was probably correct in his prediction as to the effect of his success. \"I am determined to beat Sam,\" he said to himself. The next morning he entered the schoolroom cool and confident, while Sam, though rather nervous, seemed almost equally confident. \"Mr. Taylor won\u0027t go back on me,\" he reflected, \"after dining at our house; especially after father has promised to get him a higher salary.\" The examination lasted all the session. It was partly oral and partly written. \"Boys,\" said the principal, \"I shall devote the evening to the examination of your papers. To-morrow morning my decision will be made known.\" \"I wish it were over,\" thought Sam. \"I think he\u0027ll give me the prize, but I should like to be sure of it.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3021/83557.html","bookId":260,"book":{"id":260,"title":"Wait and Hope A Plucky Boy\u0027s Luck","description":"简介： Five o\u0027clock sounded from the church clock, and straightway the streets of Milltown were filled with men, women, and children issuing from the great brick factories huddled together at one end of the town.
