He should be taking Pozderac and Hemsted into custody even as we speak. No doubt Branko will scream diplomatic immunity. We’ll see how that works out for him. Hemsted, on the other hand, does not enjoy that privilege. His testimony might be more easily coerced. As for you…”\\n\\n “I will not be arrested.”\\n\\n “No?”\\n\\n “I have committed no crime.”\\n\\n “Bribing a foreign national isn’t a crime?”\\n\\n “It was not a bribe. The Jade Lily was a gift, a copy of a priceless artifact no more valuable than tickets to the opera.”\\n\\n “I like it,” I said. “I’d hang on to that defense if I were you.”\\n\\n The room emptied soon after Fiegen dashed for the door in search of his co-conspirators. I sat down next to Mr. Donatucci. Heavenly sat across the table from us.\\n\\n “Well, sir, is this what you had in mind when you came to my house last week?” I asked.\\n\\n “Almost exactly.”\\n\\n “Sure.”\\n\\n Donatucci removed a check from his inside pocket and set it on the table in front of me.\\n\\n “One hundred and twenty-seven thousand dollars made out to cash as requested,” he said.\\n\\n “Thank you.”\\n\\n “Thank you, Batman.”\\n\\n “I wish you wouldn’t call me that.”\\n\\n Donatucci patted my shoulder and left the room. I glanced at the check, set my hand on top of it, and slid it across the table to Heavenly.\\n\\n “It’s not quite the payout you were hoping for,” I said.\\n\\n She took the check and put it in her bag.\\n\\n “Just as long as we come out ahead, that’s the main thing,” she said.\\n\\n “Thank you for saving my life.”\\n\\n “My pleasure. McKenzie?”\\n\\n “Hmm?”\\n\\n “How did you know the Jade Lily was a fake?”\\n\\n “They told me I had ten seconds to live. If they had wanted to kill me, they wouldn’t have called. So why did they call? They wanted me out of the room so they could blow up the Lily and I would be around to tell the tale. Why would they want to do that, blow up the Lily? Because they hated it so much? Because they didn’t want anyone else to own it? It’s kind of obvious once you think about it. After that, everything fell into place.”\\n\\n “But when did you figure it out?”\\n\\n “While I was holding the telephone in the motel room just before the bomb went off.”\\n\\n “You’re the master of intuitive thinking.”\\n\\n “It’s a curse.”\\n\\n JUST SO YOU KNOW\\n\\n In hindsight, it probably would have been better all around if I had allowed them to blow up the Jade Lily in that damn motel room instead of risking my life to save it.\\n\\n First of all, Von Tarpley and Dennis Cooper both pled guilty to killing Patrick Tarpley and Lieutenant Scott Noehring. Normally, you shoot a cop they drop you in a hole and you never get to see the sun again, but they cut a deal, Von and Dennis did. They gave up their right to a jury trial—during which they would have presented irrefutable evidence of Noehring’s many dastardly deeds—in exchange for the possibility of parole hearings after seventeen years. They also managed to swap the bomb charges for the names and whereabouts of the people who sold them the explosives (I guess making a bomb is worse than exploding a bomb).\\n\\n That was it as far as the courts were concerned. No one—including India Cooper—was ever charged with the theft of the Jade Lily, largely because both the museum and Jeremy Gillard refused to press charges and the insurance company claimed it had not been defrauded. I got a kick out of that—Gillard refusing to press charges against himself. There was plenty of talk about conspiracy to do this and conspiracy to do that, only nothing came of it.\\n\\n The original Lily, by the way, has yet to resurface despite Tatjana Durakovic’s tireless efforts to locate it.\\n\\n Branko Pozderac was granted diplomatic immunity and sent home, although his government removed him from the Foreign Investment Promotion Agency. Jonathan Hemsted was fired by the State Department in the morning and hired by Minnesota Disposal and Recycling in the afternoon to work as a liaison between the company and the governments of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, and Montenegro—yes, Fiegen got his garbage and wastewater cleaning contracts. Big surprise. Plus, any plans to charge Fiegen under the antibribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act were discarded when India, testifying on Fiegen’s behalf, argued that while it was an inspired facsimile of the original, the Jade Lily held little monetary value and therefore could hardly constitute a bribe. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/curse-of-the-jade-lily-mac-mckenzie-9/page-100.html","bookId":2218,"book":{"id":2218,"title":"Curse of the Jade Lily (Mac McKenzie #9)","description":"Storyline: A stolen gem with a tragic history, a curse and a million dollar ransom is Mac McKenzie\u0027s latest case, in David Housewright\u0027s Curse of the Jade Lily \\n Several years ago, Rushmore McKenzie became an unexpected millionaire and set about doing not much of anything.
