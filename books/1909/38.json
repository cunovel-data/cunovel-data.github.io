{"id":87702,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"Roland’s hips lifted and dropped, lifted and dropped, shoving Leila’s head back into the pillow, the vibrating plug working its magic in his ass, his movements so forceful his testicles flailed against Leila’s chin, the upper part of her neck. Her back bowed up, the weight of her breasts quivering forward as her mouth opened wider, taking him deep as a scream erupted around him, vibrated on him the way her pussy was violently vibrating against Marguerite’s touch, the fingers deep within her. Another sound of release joined theirs and Marguerite divided her attention to see Violet cover Mac with a hand towel as his cock pulsed, his powerful body bowed up, the muscles in his thighs knotting as she whispered the command. “Come for me, Mackenzie.” His eyes had become almost glassy in the effort to keep his gaze on Leila, Marguerite and Roland as she’d commanded. Their visual stimulation obviously had intensified the impending climax, but now in willful disobedience, he shifted his gaze to his Mistress, his eyes on the line of her back, bared in the bikini she wore so that his gaze coursed over her spine, the nape of her neck, her swept-up hair. The chair lifted, thudded back against the concrete in a rhythm that bucked Violet against him as if she were riding a bronc. Her thighs tightening accordingly, attuned completely to the big male animal beneath her, his strength and savagery all hers to command. As Leila slowly came down, shuddering, Marguerite withdrew her fingers, cupped her palm over the quivering clit and mound, making Leila writhe with the sealing in of the aftershocks under her Master’s avid gaze. Roland’s head was down, his sides shuddering like a horse after a long run. The plug still vibrated in his ass, making him jerk periodically in short convulsions. In the corner, Violet turned her body in a lithe movement to face her husband and discover his eyes on her. Her lips twisting in a smile, she leaned forward and kissed him, biting his lips in reproof at his disobedience. Her hands went up to his bound ones, lacing her fingers with his. Her lips moved, whispering to him as his large body trembled. Catching her bottom lip in a flash of teeth, he tried to shove his cock up against her, but she laughed, though the laugh was more like breathlessness. Slapping his organ playfully, she rose off him, giving his bound body a thorough appraisal. “You lie right there and get that cock hard for me again,” she purred. “Let Mistress Marguerite look at you. She’s invited me to a cup of tea.” Joseph rose, his dark eyes like coal fire, skin drawn taut over his expressive features. “Jesu Christo, Maria Madre.” He laid a hand over his heart, nodding to Marguerite. “I am overwhelmed and honored to have witnessed such expertise.” As Marguerite politely withdrew, Joseph bent and guided Leila’s hands onto his shoulders to pull her with fierce tenderness from beneath Roland. Holding her naked body against him, he filled his hands with her generous bottom. “Come, querida. You’ll be fucked by my cock now. On your hands and knees by the water, while I watch the sunset.” He caught her chin, pulled her face out of his neck. “Thank Mistress Marguerite for the pleasure of serving her.” Leila flushed. Marguerite waited until Leila raised her head, brilliant green eyes meeting hers. There was a wealth of meaning in the air between them in that moment. Not bad or hostile, simply full of the mystery of their world of bondage and submission and the complex relationships it created. “My thanks, Mistress, for the great privilege of serving you.” “The privilege was mine and I thank your kind Master. You serve him well.” She watched Joseph leave them, stopping at the door to lift Leila in his arms to carry her. “Marguerite.” It was Tyler who spoke, whose voice commanded a warm shiver down her spine. Marguerite turned and saw him extend a hand to her. Every movement toward him felt heavy, sensual. The swing of her hips, the sway of her breasts were all stroked by his gaze, making her react by swinging out her hips further. She drew back her shoulders so her breasts were even more prominently displayed, wanting the pleasure and desire in his gaze stoked to raging by her deliberate provocation. Take me if you dare, it said, and she knew it. She couldn’t divide the Mistress from the sub with him. She didn’t know if she needed to, or even wanted to do so. When she got to him, he caught her hand by the wrist, the one that had brought Leila to climax. Putting those fingers to his lips, he began to lick them. One by one, drawing each finger in, he sucked on her, taking Leila’s scent off her hand while she stood aching and wanting his mouth all over her. When he was done, he kissed the back of her hand. “You please me very much, angel.” “I want to please you even more, Master.” She said it softly, without thinking of the words. From the flare in his eyes, she realized it was the first time she’d spoken it before others. When she would have drawn away, he held her fast, held her gaze with his own, steadying her. “Then go have your tea with Mistress Violet. And I’ll be pleased just to be near you, for now.” The look he gave her had all sorts of images coming to mind. As if he knew it his gaze caressed her body again, moving over her jewel-encrusted bosom, the nipples hard and erect, her navel, the low cut of the tight pants, their firm fit at her crotch. “I should have put you in the kind that lace up the back, so I could see the lovely crease of your ass, imagine driving into it deep and hot later tonight.” His attention lifted. “But perhaps I’ll just rip that seam down the middle, take care of it myself.” “I’m yours to command,” she whispered, lost in the visual. Just lost, adrift as only he could make her feel, now that he’d somehow managed to open a fortress she thought she’d reinforced past invasion. With the thought, the uncertainty came in, the worries. How real could this be, happening so quickly, so powerfully? Then she remembered his head against her breast at the pond as she drew his pain into her. The desire between them was powerful, but it was powerful because it rested on something else, something against which she feared the lust was merely a shadow. Violet had taken a seat on the wicker sofa, her knees pressing against Roland’s side, her arm along the back of the sofa in a deceptively casual position which allowed her to keep her peripheral vision on her husband. But it was obvious that her main focus at this moment was Marguerite. Despite the rapport of the past few moments, Marguerite knew things were far from friendly between her and the other Mistress. Tyler’s love had apparently won Violet’s forgiveness, but not her trust. Marguerite didn’t blame her. She didn’t trust herself either. But it was time to clear the air with the person she knew Tyler considered his best friend. “Mistress, with your permission…” Roland interrupted her thoughts. “I need to be excused for a few moments. The call of nature and all.” Marguerite nodded, removed the plug and helped steady him to his knees, though male pride kicked in and he made it the rest of the way to his feet despite a stifled groan as she closed her hand on his cock. It moved eagerly beneath her touch, telling her he would be ready for whatever she had in mind next in little time. “You may take fifteen minutes. Drink a glass of water to re-hydrate. Come back soon. I want my tea.” A tremor ran through his body and he dared a glance at her. The expression in his eyes was somewhat dazed and she felt that familiar tightening in her body, a Mistress’s recognition that she had successfully swept the rug from beneath his reality, taken complete command of him in a way he had not expected. She passed her fingertip just along the edge of his lashes, a whimsical, ticklish touch, and he swept them down. “Yes, Mistress.” He inclined his head. “Thank you, Mistress. It’s…it’s a pleasure to serve you.” “You’re a pleasure, Roland. Hurry back.” When he nodded, she watched the virile body as he strode toward the end of the poolhouse, exercising the haste that respect for her command required. He disappeared through a door she assumed held a bathroom. Knowing Tyler, probably communal showers and a hot tub as well. The thought conjured some interesting scenarios that heated her blood further. Sarah appeared at the entrance to the pool house, tea tray in hand as if Tyler had a way of telepathically summoning her. Again, Marguerite wouldn’t put it past him. He rose and met her at the door, took the tray so she did not have to come all the way in. Marguerite noted the way Sarah studiously kept her eyes only on Tyler’s face, though when she turned, her gaze inadvertently swept over Mac. She tripped on the threshold. Tyler steadied her, murmured his thanks. Marguerite’s amusement gave way to surprise when Sarah postponed her retreat until she’d found Marguerite and inclined her head, a courteous acknowledgement that might have been offered the lady of the house. Marguerite nodded in return, somewhat amazed and warmed. The woman smiled, retreated up the walkway to the house. Tyler brought the tea tray over to the two women and gave Marguerite a wink. “She’s tough to impress. I think she might decide to keep you and throw me out.” “Probably a wise decision on her part,” Violet observed dryly, but Marguerite noted her eyes were thoughtful at the exchange. She herself felt absurdly bolstered by Sarah’s vote of confidence. As Tyler settled the tea tray on the side table next to Violet, Marguerite reached out, touched his arm. “I’d like to ask you to give us some privacy for a bit. I want time with Mistress Violet.” Violet looked surprised that Marguerite herself had initiated the confrontation, but she quickly recovered. “A good idea. Go play over there.” Violet nodded across the pool, to a grouping of lounge chairs. “Read one of your tedious industry magazines. Marguerite and I want time for girl talk without your busy nose in the middle of it.” Tyler raised a brow. “Last time I checked, this was my home.” “Last time I checked, I could probably kick your ass.” He snorted, straightened as Violet regarded him with dancing eyes, but there was a firm determination to her mouth that made his eyes narrow in return.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/mirror-of-my-soul-nature-of-desire-4/page-38.html","bookId":1909,"book":{"id":1909,"title":"Mirror of My Soul (Nature of Desire #4)","description":"Storyline: Mirror of My Soul (Nature of Desire #4) Some stories can\u0027t be contained between the covers of just one book.
