{"id":1909,"title":"Mirror of My Soul (Nature of Desire #4)","description":"Storyline: Mirror of My Soul (Nature of Desire #4) \\n Some stories can\u0027t be contained between the covers of just one book. In Ice Queen, Tyler helped Mistress Marguerite fulfill the mentoring requirement The Zone club imposes on all its Dominant members, to learn about BDSM from the submissive\u0027s perspective. Though Marguerite is one of The Zone\u0027s most sought-after Mistresses, Tyler is convinced she is a \"switch\", a closet submissive. But the truth that is revealed is more remarkable than that. \\n As he begins to unravel the complex and terrible layers of her past, Tyler must do what he\u0027s never been willing to do before. \\n Open up his own soul, offering Marguerite his own dark places in order to help them both heal. Only then will they be able to surrender to a force stronger even than The Zone\u0027s most powerful Master and Mistressâ€”a force that can bind them together forever.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/mirror-of-my-soul-nature-of-desire-4.jpg","author":"Joey W.
