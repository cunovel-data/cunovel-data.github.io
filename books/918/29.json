I cannot believe it, there is so much fire there. But I wired you to ask if I was to tell ——. Also to read 2nd ch. Bhag. G?ta. That, my dear fellow, solves all these troubles for me though it don\u0027t kill out immediate pain. Besides, it is Karma just and wise. Defects are in us all, and if this is the taking off why it means that a lot of obstructive Karma is thus at once and forever worked off, and has left —— free for greater work in better places. I would I were there with you. Tell him how much I love him and that in this era of Kali Yuga no sincere one, such as he, remains long away from the work there is to do. Words are of no use. I have sent thoughts, and those are useful, whether we are in the body or out of it. I sent every night lately all the help I could and continued through the day, not only to ——, but also you. It reached43 there, I know, but I can\u0027t overcome Karma if it is too strong. \\n\\n \\n\\n Tell —— if it should come to the worst, that no regrets about the work are needed. What has already been accomplished there will last, and seethe and do its work for several years to come. So in that direction there could be nothing to regret. I cannot write —— directly: but if able to hear this—or maybe when it arrives—then head it as if it were to him, and not to you. \\n\\n \\n\\n So, dear ——, in the presence of your wire this is all I can write. You know my feelings, and I need not say any more \\n\\n \\n\\n As Ever. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1908/54929.html","bookId":918,"book":{"id":918,"title":"Letter That Have Helped Me","description":"简介： In the Path for May, 1887, we find these words: We need a literature, not solely for highly intellectual persons, but of a more simple character, which attempts to appeal to ordinary common-sense minds who are really fainting for such moral and menta...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1908","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:52 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:52 AM"}}
