Right Here and Now . . .....RIGHT HERE AND NOW,as an old friend used to say,we are in the fluid present,where clear-sightedness never guarantees perfect vision. Here:about two hundred feet,the height of a gliding eagle,above Wisconsin\u0027s far western edge,where the vagaries of the Mississippi River declare a natural border.Now:an early Friday morning in mid-July a few years into both a new century and a new millennium,their way-ward courses so hidden that a blind man has a better chance of seeing what lies ahead than you or I.Right here and now,the hour is just past six a.m., and the sun stands low in the cloudless eastern sky,a fat,confi-dent yellow-white ball advancing as ever for the first time toward the fu-ture and leaving in its wake the steadily accumulating past,which darkens as it recedes,making blind men of us all. Below,the early sun touches the river \u0027s wide,soft ripples with molten highlights.Sunlight glints from the tracks of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad running between the riverbank and the backs of the shabby two-story houses along County Road Oo,known as Nailhouse Row,the lowest point of the comfortable-looking little town extending uphill and eastward beneath us.At this moment in the Coulee Country, life seems to be holding its breath.The motionless air around us carries such remarkable purity and sweetness that you might imagine a man could smell a radish pulled out of the ground a mile away.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/black-house-the-talisman-2/page-1.html","bookId":2022,"book":{"id":2022,"title":"Black House (The Talisman #2)","description":"Storyline: Two of the greatest storytellers of our time join forces to create an epic thriller of unsurpassed power; a twisting, compelling story of a small American town held in the grip of evil beyond all reason. French Landing, Wisconsin. A comfortable, solid middle-American town inhabited by comfortable, solid middle-Americans! and a serial killer. Three children have been lost -- taken by a monster with a taste for child\u0027s flesh nicknamed \u0027The Fisherman\u0027 after a legendary murderer. It\u0027s all way beyond the experience of the local police, whose only hope lies with ex-detective Jack Sawyer, the man who cracked their last case for them. But, plagued by visions of another world, Jack has retired to this rural retreat precisely to avoid such horrors -- and, having recognized the touch of madness on this case, he\u0027s keeping well away. Soon, he\u0027ll have no choice. Young Tyler Marshall, left behind one afternoon by his bullying friends, pedals past the local old folks\u0027 home and is accosted by a crow. \u0027Gorg,\u0027 it caws, and \u0027Ty.\u0027 What ten-year-old could resist a bird that speaks his name? Not Ty, that\u0027s for sure. And as he follows the mysterious crow, he\u0027s grabbed by the neck and dragged into a hedge. The Fisherman has made another catch!","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/black-house-the-talisman-2.jpg","author":"Stephen King","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/black-house-the-talisman-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:09:17 PM"}}
