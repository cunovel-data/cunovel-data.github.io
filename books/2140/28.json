His face was ashen, and it was no trick of the light, she knew. His chest barely moved, and the bandages she had only recently changed were already blood-stained yet again.\\n\\n Another rock hit close outside, shaking the ground but not even stirring Catti-brie, for the explosions had been sounding repeatedly. The bombardment had increased in tempo and ferocity. Every twentieth missile or so was no rock but a burning fire pot that spread lines of devastation, often igniting secondary fires within the town. Three blazes had already been put out in the wizard\u0027s tower, and Dagnabbit had warned that the integrity of the structure had been compromised.\\n\\n They hadn\u0027t moved Bruenor, though, for there was nowhere else to go.\\n\\n Catti-brie sat and stared at her father, remembering all the good times, all the things he had done for her, all the adventures they had shared. Her mind told her that that was over, though her heart surely argued against that conclusion.\\n\\n In truth, they were waiting for Bruenor to die, for when he took his last breath, they-all who remained-would crawl out of their holes and over the battered walls and make their desperate run to the south. That was their only hope, slim though it was.\\n\\n But Catti-brie could hardly believe she was sitting there waiting for Bruenor to die. She could hardly accept that the toughened old dwarf\u0027s chest would sometime soon go still, that he would no longer draw breath. She had always thought he would outlive her.\\n\\n She had witnessed his fall once before and had thought him dead, when he had ridden the shadow dragon down into the gorge in Mithral Hall. She remembered that heartbreak, the unbelievable hole she had felt in her heart, the sense of helplessness and the surreal nature of it all.\\n\\n She was feeling that again, all of it, only this time the end would come before her eyes, undeniably and with no room for hope.\\n\\n The woman felt a strong hand on her shoulder then and turned to see Wulfgar moving in beside her. He draped his arm across her shoulders, and she put her head on his strong chest.\\n\\n \"I wish Drizzt would return,\" Wulfgar remarked quietly, and Catti-brie looked at him. \"And with Regis beside him,\" the barbarian said. \"We should all be together for this.\"\\n\\n \"For the end of Bruenor\u0027s life?\"\\n\\n \"For all of it,\" Wulfgar explained. \"For the run to the south, or the last stand here. It would be fitting.\"\\n\\n They said no more. They didn\u0027t have to. Each was feeling the exact same thing, each was remembering the exact same things.\\n\\n Up above, the rain of boulders continued.\\n\\n \"How many orcs are there?\" Innovindil asked Tarathiel.\\n\\n The two elves were far from the Moonwood, flying through the night on their winged horses. She had to shout to be heard, and even then her voice carried thinly on the night breezes.\\n\\n \"Enough so that the security of our own home will surely be compromised,\" Tarathiel answered with all confidence.\\n\\n They were in the foothills to the north of the town of Shallows, looking back at the hundreds of fires of orc camps and at the flames engulfing sections of the town, most notably the lone tower that so clearly marked the place.\\n\\n The pair set down on one high ridge to better converse.\\n\\n \"We cannot help them,\" Tarathiel said to his more compassionate companion as soon as they set down and he could better sec the look upon her fair face. \"Even if we could get to the Moonwood and rouse all the clan, we\u0027d not return in time to turn the tide of this battle. Nor should we try,\" he added, seeing her doubting expression. \"Our first responsibility is to the forest we name as our home, and if this black tide turns to the east and crosses the Surbrin, we will know war soon enough.\"\\n\\n \"There is truth in your words,\" Innovindil admitted. \"I wonder if we might go there, though, and perhaps pull some from the disaster before the darkness closes in over them.\"\\n\\n Tarathiel shook his head and painted on an expression that showed no room for debate.\\n\\n \"Ore arrows would chase us every inch,\" he argued, \"and if they brought down Sunrise and Sunset, what good would we do for anybody? Who would fly to the cast and warn our people?\"\\n\\n He pressed on with the argument, though Innovindil didn\u0027t need to hear it. She understood her responsibilities, and just as importantly, her limitations. She knew that the catastrophe to the south was far beyond the ability of her and her friend, and all their clan, to correct.\\n\\n It pained her, it pained them both, to watch the town of Shallows die, for though the elves of the Moonwood were no friends to any of the humans in the area, neither were they enemies.\\n\\n They could only watch.\\n\\n It was a difficult climb, made all the more so because of the swelling and soreness in his twisted ankle. Hand over hand, Drizzt pulled himself up the long and narrow natural chimney, chasing the last flickers of diminishing daylight up above.\\n\\n Diminishing daylight.\\n\\n The drow paused, more than halfway up the three hundred foot climb. The worse thing about the fading afternoon light above was that Drizzt knew it was not the day after he had first crawled into the cave, but was the day after that. The size of the caverns had truly surprised him. It was a vast underground network, and he had spent nearly two days wandering through it, looking for a way back to the surface. Following lighter air, the drow had found many dead ends, chutes and openings too small for him to exit through.\\n\\n He was beginning to suspect that he had found another, but he continued his climb. Still, each foot traversed made it clearer to him that this too was a dead end. The light above had shone brilliantly when first he had seen it, a welcomed contrast to the darkness of the caverns, but that had been due to the angle of the sun, the drow realized, and not the width of the opening.\\n\\n He continued up another hundred feet before he knew for certain that he would have to double back, that the opening would admit no more than an arm or perhaps his head.\\n\\n With a quiet reminder to himself that his friends needed him, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden started back down.\\n\\n An hour later, he was walking as swiftly as his sore ankle and his sheer exhaustion would permit. He considered doubling back, moving all the way to where he had first entered the tunnels in the hope that he might move the barriers the giants had constructed there, but he shook that thought away.\\n\\n The sun had long risen before the drow found the next opening, and this time the exit was large enough.\\n\\n Drizzt came out into the daylight, blinking against the stinging brilliance, letting his eyes adjust as much as possible. Then he spent a long while studying the mountains around him, trying to find some recognizable landmark that would guide him back to Shallows. The angle was too different, though. Observing the sun told him east from west, and north from south, though, so he started south. He was hoping to hit the Fell Pass, and hoping that he would find his bearings once the ground had somewhat leveled out.\\n\\n He tore a sleeve from his shirt and tightened the splint around his ankle, then trotted away, ignoring the pain. He watched the sun pass its zenith above him, then move to the western horizon and drop behind.\\n\\n Hours later, he found the Fell Pass and recognized the ground.\\n\\n He ran on to the east across the foothills, urgency growing with each stride. A short while later, he saw a distant glow against the lightening sky of the southeast. He rushed up over one hill, finding a better viewpoint and saw, in the distance, flames climbing into the night sky.\\n\\n Withegroo\u0027s tower.\\n\\n His heart pumping more out of fear than from exertion, Drizzt ran on. He saw a glowing ball sail across the sky, north to south. When it hit it burst into flame in the battered town.\\n\\n Drizzt didn\u0027t veer to the south, instead charging straight for the giants\u0027 position, determined to deter them yet again. His hand went to his onyx figurine, though he didn\u0027t bring the panther to him just yet.\\n\\n \"Be ready, Guenhwyvar,\" he said quietly. \"Soon we find battle.\"\\n\\n Drizzt knew that fire in the night distorted distances greatly, and so he was not surprised at how long it took him to get back near the town and the attacking giants.\\n\\n He moved to the northern rim of the ravine in clear sight of Shallows. He could see the defenders rushing around. The tower was burning, though not nearly as brightly as before, and most of the activity was centered around it.\\n\\n The giants seemed to be concentrating on that particular target as well.\\n\\n Drizzt took out the figurine and set it on the ground, determined to bring forth Guenhwyvar and charge straight on into the giant encampment. He paused, though, noting a familiar figure atop that burning tower.\\n\\n Drizzt couldn\u0027t make out much, but one thing showed clearly to him: a one-horned helmet that he knew so very well.\\n\\n \"Defy them, Bruenor,\" the drow whispered, a wry grin on his face.\\n\\n Almost in response, a series of missiles smashed against that tower, one clipping right near the brightest burning fires and sending a shower of sparks through the night sky.\\n\\n There the dwarf remained, atop the structure, directing the forces on the ground.\\n\\n Drizzt\u0027s smile widened, or started to, for then there came a loud groaning and scraping sound from the south. Eyes wide with horror, Drizzt watched the tower lean, watched the dwarf atop it scramble to the edge, diving desperately for the rim.\\n\\n The tower toppled to the south, and half fell over, half crumbled, so that the poor doomed dwarf fell down amidst tons of crushing stone.\\n\\n Drizzt didn\u0027t even realize his own movements, didn\u0027t even register that his legs hadn\u0027t supported him through that terrible sight, that he was sitting down on the stone.\\n\\n He knew beyond any doubt that no one in all the world could have survived that catastrophe.\\n\\n A chill rushed through him. His hands trembled and tears filled his violet eyes.\\n\\n \"Bruenor,\" he whispered over and over.\\n\\n His hands reached out to the south, into the empty air, with nothing to hold on to. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-thousand-orcs-hunter-s-blades-1/page-28.html","bookId":2140,"book":{"id":2140,"title":"The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1)","description":"Storyline: The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1) \\n This mass market reprint focuses primarily on his signature character, Drizzt Doourden, who has been the subject of most of Salvatore\u0027s best-selling titles for Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
