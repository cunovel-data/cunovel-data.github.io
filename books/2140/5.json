{"id":95610,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"The dwarf councilor, Agrathan Hardhammer, shifted uneasily in his seat as the volume around him increased along with the agitation of the others, all human, in the room. \"Perhaps you should have granted him an audience,\" said Shoudra Stargleam, the sceptrana of the city. Shoudra\u0027s bright blue eyes flashed as she spoke, and she shook her head, as she always seemed to be doing, letting her long dark hair fly wide to either side. Her hair was often the subject of gossip among the women of the city, for though Shoudra was in her thirties and had lived for all her life in the harsh, windblown climate of Mirabar, it held the luster and shine that one might expect on the head of a girl half Shoudra\u0027s age. In all respects, the sceptrana was a beautiful creature, tall and lithe, yet with deceptively delicate features. Deceptive, because though she was ultimately feminine, Shoudra Stargleam was possessed of a solidity, a formidability, that rivaled the strongest of Mirabar\u0027s men. The fat man sitting on the cushioned throne, the Marchion of Mirabar, smirked at her and waved his hands in disgust. \"I had, and have, more important matters to attend to than to see to the needs of an unannounced visitor,\" the marchion said, staring hard at Agrathan as he spoke, \"even if that visitor is the King of Mithral Hall. Besides, is it not your duty, and not mine own, to negotiate trade agreements?\" \"King Bruenor did not come here for any such purpose, by any reports,\" Shoudra protested, drawing another wave of Marchion Elastul \u0027s thick hands. Elastul shook his head and looked about at his Hammers, his principal attendants, scarred old warriors all. \"Might that she should\u0027ve met with Bruenor anyway,\" Djaffar, the leader of the group, remarked. He nudged the marchion\u0027s shoulder. \"Shoudra\u0027s got a trick or two that could soften even a dwarf!\" The other three soldier-advisors and Marchion Elastul burst out in snickers at that. Shoudra Stargleam narrowed her blue eyes and assumed a defiant pose, crossing her arms over her chest. To the side, Agrathan shifted again. He knew Shoudra could handle herself, and that she, like all the folk of Mirabar who had any access to Elastul, was used to the liberties of protocol often taken by the vulgar Hammers and by the marchion himself. His was an inherited position, unlike the elected councilors and sceptrana. \"He asked to see you, Marchion, not me and not the council,\" Shoudra reminded curtly, ending the snickers. \"And what am I to do with the likes of Bruenor Battlehammer?\" Elastul replied. \"Dine with him? Cater to him, and quietly explain to him that he will soon be irrelevant?\" Shoudra looked over at Agrathan plaintively, and the dwarf cleared his throat, drawing the marchion\u0027s attention. \"Ye wouldn\u0027t be doing well to underestimate Bruenor,\" Agrathan advised. \"His boys\u0027re good at what they do.\" \"Irrelevant,\" Elastul said again, settling back comfortably. \"That curiosity piece Gandalug is dead, may the stones powder his bones, and Bruenor is inheriting a kingdom on the decline.\" Again, Shoudra looked over at Agrathan, this time wearing a doubting smirk, for she and the dwarf knew what was coming. \"More than two dozen metallurgists and alchemists.\" Elastul boasted. \"I\u0027m paying them well, and they\u0027ll be showing results soon enough!\" Agrathan lowered his eyes so that Elastul wouldn\u0027t see his doubting expression as the marchion went on to describe the most recent promises of those folks he had hired in an effort to strengthen the metal produced by Mirabar\u0027s mines. The metallurgists had been promising from the day they arrived, several years before, combinations of strength and flexibility beyond anything anyone in all the world could produce. Grand, and as far as Agrathan believed, empty claims all. Agrathan hadn\u0027t worked the mines in over a century -since he had turned to the practice of preaching the word of Dumathoin-but as a priest of that dwarf god, a deity who was known as the Keeper of Secrets Under the Mountain, Agrathan firmly believed that the claims of the hired alchemists and metallurgists were not among those secrets. To Agrathan, if some magical way to enhance any metal wasn\u0027t among the secrets of Dumathoin, then it simply didn\u0027t exist. The hired group was very good at what it did. What it did, as far as Agrathan was concerned, was keep the marchion curious and intrigued enough to keep the gold flowing, and that was all that was flowing. Mirabar boasted less than half the dwarves of Mithral Hall, just over two thousand, and several hundred of those were busy serving in the Axe. keeping the mines clear of monsters. The thousand who worked the mines could barely meet the quotas set out by the Council of Sparkling Stones each year and that from existing veins. Little exploration was being done at the deeper levels, where the dangers were greater, but so too were the true promises of better quality in the form of better ore. The simple fact was that Mirabar couldn\u0027t afford to cut production long enough to seek out those better veins, so the marchion had fallen into the scam of these supposed specialists-with not a dwarf among them - who claimed to understand metals so well. Besides, to Agrathan\u0027s thinking, if there were such processes as the marchion believed, why hadn\u0027t they been put in practice centuries before? Why hadn\u0027t these metallurgists and alchemists reduced the dwarves of Mithral Hall, the dwarves of all the world, to positions of providing base material alone? They promised weapons, armor, and other metal goods strong enough to outshine anything Bruenor\u0027s folk might produce, and yet, if they knew of such secrets, if there were such secrets, then why weren\u0027t there weapons of legend that had been produced through such processes? \"Even if your specialists deliver their promises, we will still be far from making King Bruenor and Mithral Hall \u0027irrelevant\u0027,\" Shoudra Stargleam replied, and Agrathan was glad that she was taking the lead. \"They are out-producing us in volume more than three-to-two.\" The marchion waved his hands at her. \"There was nothing for me to say to Bruenor Battlehammer anyway. Why did he come here? Who invited him? Who asked . . .\" He ended with a derisive snort. \"Perhaps we should not have allowed him entrance,\" Shoudra remarked. Agrathan looked up at Elastul, guessing correctly the dangerous glare the marchion would be offering to Shoudra at that moment. When word that King Bruenor was at Mirabar\u0027s gate had been passed along, it had been Elastul\u0027s decision to let Bruenor and the others in. None on the council, or the secptrana, had even been informed until the Clan Battlehammer dwarves had already set up their carts on Mirabar\u0027s streets. \"Yes, perhaps my faith in the loyalty of my citizens was misplaced,\" the marchion countered, harsh words aimed more at Agrathan, the dwarf knew, than at Shoudra. \"I expected King Bruenor to find greater embarrassment than rejection by the ruler of the city. I expected the folk of Mirabar to know enough to not even bother with our guests.\" Agrathan glanced over to see that the marchion was indeed staring directly at him as he spoke. No humans, after all, had gone to do business with Clan Battlehammer, only dwarves, and Agrathan was the highest-ranking dwarf in the city, the unofficial leader and voice of Mirabar\u0027s two thousand. \"Have you spoken with Master Hammerstriker?\" \"What would ye have me say?\" Agrathan asked. While he was the accepted voice for the dwarves among the human leaders, that wasn\u0027t always the case among the Mirabarran dwarves themselves. \"I would have you remind Master Hammerstriker where his loyalties lie,\" the marchion replied. \"Or where they should lie.\" Agrathan worked hard to keep his expression placid, to hide the sudden storm welling inside of him. The loyalty of Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker could not be questioned. The crusty old warrior had served the marchion, and the marchion before him, and before him, and before him, and before him, and before him, for longer than any human in the city could remember, longer than the long dead parents of the dead parents of any human in the city could have remembered. Torgar had been among the leading soldiers charging along the tunnels of the upper Underdark against monsters more foul than anything any of the marchion\u0027s Hammers-those elite advisors selected supposedly because of their glorious veteran warrior status-had ever known. When the orc hordes attacked Mirabar, a hundred and seventeen years past, Torgar and a very few other dwarves had held the eastern wall strong against the assault, fending off the hordes while the bulk of Mirabar\u0027s warriors had been engaged on the western wall, against what had proven to be no more than a feint by the enemy. In scars, wounds, and cunning victories, Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker had earned his position as a leader among the Axe. But even to Agrathan the marchion\u0027s words rang with a bit of truth. It wasn\u0027t a question of loyalty, as far as Agrathan was concerned, but rather one of judgment. Torgar and his fellows had not understood the implications of trading with their rivals from Mithral Hall or from subsequently socializing with them. With that, Agrathan and Shoudra left the agitated marchion, walking side by side along the outer corridors of the palace and out into the pale sunlight of the late afternoon. A chill breeze was blowing, a reminder to the pair that in Mirabar, winter was never far away. \"You will approach Torgar with a bit more gentleness than Marchion Elastul showed?\" Shoudra asked the dwarf, her smile one of genuine amusement. As sceptrana, Shoudra was involved in signing trade agreements. With the rise of Mithral Hall, she too had suffered, or at least her work had. Shoudra Stargleam had taken it more in stride than many others in the city, though, including many of the dwarves. To her, the way to beat Mithral Hall was to increase production and find better ore for better product. To her, the rise of a trading rival should be the catalyst to make Mirabar stronger. \"I\u0027ll tell Torgar and his boys what I can, but ye know that one, and know that not many can be telling Torgar anything.\" \"He is loyal to Mirabar,\" Shoudra stated, and though Agrathan nodded, the expression on his face showed that he wasn\u0027t so certain of that anymore. Shoudra Stargleam caught that look and stopped, and put her hand on Agrathan\u0027s shoulder to stop him as well. \"Is he loyal to city or to race?\" she asked. \"Does he consider the marchion his true leader or King Bruenor of Mithral Hall?\" \u0027Torgar\u0027s fought well for every marchion since before yer parents were born, girl,\" Agrathan reminded her. Shoudra nodded, but like Torgar a moment earlier, she didn\u0027t seem overly convinced. \"They should not have gone to trade and drink with the visiting dwarves,\" Shoudra remarked. She bustled her cloak in front of her and started on her way. \"Mighty temptations there. Good trade, good drink, and better stories. Are ye thinking that my folk aren\u0027t wanting to hear the Battle of Keeper\u0027s Dale? Are ye thinking that your own world would be a better place if the damn drow invaders had won at Mithral Hall?\" \"Well, perhaps if\" the dark elves had inflicted a bit more damage before they had been chased off.. ..\" Shoudra replied. Agrathan snapped a scowl over her, but it was quickly defeated, for the woman was grinning mischievously even as she spoke the words. \"Bah!\" Agrathan snorted. \"So by your reasoning, Mirabar owes a debt to Mithral Hall for their victory against the dark elves?\" Shoudra asked. Agrathan paused for a moment and thought long and hard on that one. In the end, he shrugged, not willing to make a commitment. Shoudra grinned again and nodded, for it was obvious that the dwarf\u0027s heart was giving one answer and his pragmatic head, the part that owed loyalty to Marchion Elastul and Mirabar, was giving another. H wasn\u0027t a laughing matter, though. In fact, the notion that Agrathan, a major voice on the Council of Sparkling Stones, was apparently holding mixed feelings concerning Mithral Hall incited more than a little trepidation in the sceptrana. Agrathan had been one of the strongest voices of opposition to Mithral Hall, often relating the words of his more vocal dwarf constituents who wanted covert action to be taken against Clan Battlehammer. Agrathan had once outlined a plan for infiltrating the neighboring kingdom and slipping cooler-burning charcoal into their stores, weakening their smelting and shaping work. Many times during council meetings Agrathan Hardhammer had himself exploded in tirades against the dwarves of Clan Battlehammer, but having seen them face-to-face, Shoudra was seeing the true depth of his, and his people\u0027s, resolve. \u0027Tell me, Agrathan, was that famous drow elf accompanying King Bruenor\u0027s caravan?\" \"Drizzt Do\u0027Urden? Yes, he was there, but they didn\u0027t let him into the city.\" Shoudra looked at him curiously. Drizzt had made quite a reputation for himself in the North, even before his actions against his own people when they had attacked Mithral Hall. By all accounts, he was a hero. \"The Axe weren\u0027t about to let a cursed dark elf walk the streets, whatever his name,\" Agrathan said firmly, \"but he was there. Torgar and some others saw him and that human girl that Bruenor is calling his own, along with that human boy that Bruenor is calling his own, off to the side, watching it all.\" \"Was he as handsome as they say?\" Shoudra asked. Agrathan turned an even bigger scowl over her, twisted into an expression of skepticism. \"He\u0027s a drow, ye damned fool!\" Shoudra Stargleam merely laughed, and Agrathan shook his hairy head. They stopped their walk then, for they had come to Undercity Square, an open area between three buildings, one of them a large sectioned building where Shoudra kept her apartment. In the center of the triangular area was a descending stairway, which led to the most heavily guarded room in all of\" Mirabar, the main entrance to the Undercity-the real city as far as Agrathan and his kin were concerned - where the real work went on. Shoudra bid the dwarf farewell and entered her house. Agrathan stood at the top of the stairway for a long, long while, more uncomfortable than he had ever been before entering the domain of Mirabar\u0027s two thousand dwarves. It was his solemn duty to go and deliver the marchion\u0027s message to Torgar and the others, but Agrathan knew his kin well enough to understand that the words would cause more than a little anger and division among the dwarves. Their emotions ran the gamut concerning Mithral Hall. Many of the Mirabarran dwarves had even called for confiscation of any Mithral Hall caravan moving west of Clan Battlehammer\u0027s domain, knowing full well that such an action might mean open warfare between the two cities. Others quietly remarked that their ancestors had lived in Mithral Hall with King Bruenor\u0027s predecessors, and that it had been a good life, as good a life as any dwarf could ever want. Agrathan snorted-a \"dwarven sigh,\" he called it-and thumped his way down the stairs, brushing past the many human guards in the upper chamber as he made his way to the lift. He waved away the attendant and worked the heavy ropes himself, lowering himself down hundreds of feet to a second well-guarded room, with all exits blocked by external portcullises and iron-bound doors. The guards there were all dwarves, some of the toughest of all the Axe. \"Ye go and put the word to all our kin in all the holes,\" Agrathan instructed them, \"and to them working the walls up top. We\u0027re meeting after sunset in the Hall of All Fires, and I want every one of my boys there. Everyone!\" The guards opened one of the exits for Agrathan and he exited, head down and murmuring to himself, trying to discern the best way to handle this most delicate of situations. Though he was more tactful than most, as was evidenced by his rank in a city that was dominated by humans, Agrathan was still a dwarf, and subtlety had never been his strong point. The scene was never controlled and quiet in the Hall of All Fires when a significant number of Mirabar\u0027s dwarves were assembled, but that night, with nearly all of the city\u0027s two thousand in attendance and with the subject so controversial, the place was in absolute chaos. \"So now ye\u0027re to tell me whose story I can hear, and whose I can\u0027t?\" Torgar Hammerstriker roared back at Agrathan. \"It was a good bit o\u0027 ale, and a finer bit o\u0027 tales!\u0027\u0027 Many of the dwarves who had accompanied Torgar to the Icewind Dale bazaar and later to the Clan Battlehammer reception shouted their agreement. One or two held up beautiful pieces of scrimshaw they had purchased from the traders, wonderful pieces gotten at better prices. \"I can resell this in Nesme for ten times what I paid!\" one industrious, red-bearded fellow declared. He jumped high onto a dark furnace, holding up his small statue-a scrimshaw depiction of a shapely barbarian woman-for all to see. \"Ye tellin\u0027 me I can\u0027t be making good deals, priest?\" Agrathan slumped back a bit, not surprised by the reaction. \"I have come to deliver the words of Marchion Elastul, a reminder- and yes, a stern one-to us all that the dwarves of Clan Battlehammer are not friends to Mirabar. They take our trade-\" \"Is there a one of us here who can rightly say that he\u0027s livin\u0027 better since they opened Mithral Hall again?\" another dwarf cut the priest off. \"Even wit\u0027 yer pretty statue, fat Bullwhip, ye\u0027re not to have a good year in the matter o\u0027 yer purse, now are ye?\" Many dwarves seconded that, cheering the agitated speaker on. \"We had better lives and bigger coins afore the damn Battlehammers came back in! And who invited them?\" \"Bah! Ye\u0027re talking the part of a fool!\" Torgar lashed out. \"Says the dwarf who looked to other councilors for a loan!\" the fiery one shot back. \"Ye needin\u0027 coin now, Torgar? Will King Bruenor\u0027s stories fill yer belly?\" Torgar climbed up to the raised area at the north end of the hall to stand beside Agrathan. He paused for a long while, looking to and fro, commanding everyone\u0027s attention. \"What I\u0027m hearing here is jealous talk, plain and simple,\" he said, very calmly. \"Ye\u0027re talking about Clan Battlehammer as if they\u0027ve declared war upon us, when all they\u0027ve done is open up mines that\u0027ve been there, and been theirs, since afore Mirabar was Mirabar. They\u0027ve a right to their homeland and a right to make it work. We\u0027re sittin\u0027 here making plans to bring \u0027em down, when it\u0027s seemin\u0027 to me that we should be making plans to bring ourselfs up!\" \"They been stealin\u0027 our business!\" someone yelled from the crowd. \"Ye forgetting that part?\" \"They been beatin\u0027 us,\" Torgar pointedly, and immediately, corrected. \"They got better mines an\u0027 better metal, and they built themselves a strong reputation one dead orc, duergar, and stinkin\u0027 drow elf at a time. Ye can\u0027t be blamin\u0027 King Bruenor and his boys for working hard and fighting harder!\" The shouts erupted from every corner, many in agreement and many in dissent. A couple of fistfights broke out in various corners of the hall. Up on the raised platform, Torgar and Agrathan stared hard at each other, and though neither had fully embraced the other\u0027s viewpoint on this matter only a few days before, their respective visions were crystallizing. There came a shout from somewhere in the crowd, \"Hey priestie, ye taking the side o\u0027 the humans over that o\u0027 yer kinfolk dwarfs?\" Both Torgar and Agrathan turned at once, and many others did as well. All the great meeting chamber went silent, dwarves stopping their fighting in mid-swing, for there it was, spelled out simply and to the point. For Torgar, it was a moment of confusion and self-examination. Was it actually coming down to this, a choice between his dwarven kin of Mithral Hall and the joint community of Mirabar? For Agrathan, leading member of the Council of Sparkling Stones, the choice was less fuzzy, for indeed, if that was the way that some of his kin chose to view things, then so be it. Agrathan\u0027s loyalties lay to Mirabar and to Mirabar alone, but when he looked at his counterpart, he saw that the marchion\u0027s remarks, which Agrathan had considered insulting, toward Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker were not without merit. Agrathan\u0027s faith in his community was a bit shaken a moment later, when the great gates of the Hall of All Fires swung wide and a large contingent of the Axe of Mirabar swept in, wading into the confused throng in a wedge formation, then forcefully widening their stance so that a huge triangular area of the room was quickly secured. In marched the marchion and several of the more stern councilors, along with the sceptrana. \"This is not the behavior the human folk of Mirabar expects from their dwarf comrades,\" Elastul scolded. He should have left it at that, a quiet and calm reminder that the city had enough enemies without to worry about such squabbles within. \"Accept that Torgar Hammerstriker and those who accompanied him to the carts of Clan Battlehammer, and to the liars . . . er, the bards of the same clan erred, and badly, in their judgment,\" Elastul bluntly warned. \"Beware, Master Hammerstriker, lest you lose your position in the Axe. For the rest of you, lured by ale and this creature, this false legend, who is Bruenor Battlehammer, remind yourselves where your loyalties lie, and remind yourselves as well that Clan Battlehammer threatens our city.\" Elastul swiveled his head slowly, taking in all the gathering, trying to wilt them under his stern gaze. But these were dwarves, after all, and few wilted, and few of those who agreed with the marchion wagged their heads. Many of those who disagreed stood a bit straighter and a bit taller, and in looking at his counterpart on the stage, Agrathan seriously wondered if Torgar was going to peel off his Axe insignia then and there and throw it at Elastul\u0027s feet. \"Disperse, I command you!\" Marchion Elastul roared. \"Back to your work, and back to your lives.\" The dwarves did disperse then, and the marchion and his entourage, including the human soldiers, departed, with the sole exception of Shoudra Stargleam who stayed to speak with Agrathan. \"Well, ain\u0027t them the words of a true king,\" Torgar muttered as he walked past Agrathan, and he spat at the priest\u0027s feet. \"The marchion was ill-advised to be coming here like that now,\" Agrathan remarked to Shoudra when they were alone. \"Many of your peers on the council pressed him to action,\" Shoudra explained. \"They feared that the visit of King Bruenor might be having an adverse affect on our dwarf citizens.\" \"It was,\" Agrathan said glumly, \"and it is. Even more now.\" Agrathan meant every word. He watched the remaining dwarves departing the hall or going back to stoke the furnaces that lined it. He noted their expressions, their deep-set scowls and angry eyes. Torgar\u0027s misjudgment had brought a rift in the clan, had put a wedge into the solid community. Agrathan couldn\u0027t help but think that the marchion had just taken a sledge and smashed that wedge hard.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-thousand-orcs-hunter-s-blades-1/page-5.html","bookId":2140,"book":{"id":2140,"title":"The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1)","description":"Storyline: The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1) This mass market reprint focuses primarily on his signature character, Drizzt Doourden, who has been the subject of most of Salvatore\u0027s best-selling titles for Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
