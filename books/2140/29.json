{"id":95634,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"She could see nothing, could feel only the pain of raw scrapes all around her arms and shoulders, and the discomfort of breathing in chunks of stony dust. She groped around in the darkness of the partially collapsed tunnel, searching desperately for her father.\\n\\n Luck was with her, for the area around which Bruenor lay had survived the catastrophe almost intact. Catti-brie got up beside her father, gently running her hands over his face, then putting her ear low to his mouth, to find that he was still breathing, shallow though it was.\\n\\n The woman turned around, trying to get her bearings, trying to figure out which way would provide the shortest route to the surface, though she wondered if she should even go to the surface at all. Had the orcs come on in full after the fall of Withegroo\u0027s tower, which surely had fallen? If so, she wondered if she would be better off staying there, in the dark, for as long as she could manage before trying to find a way out of the town altogether so she could head for the south.\\n\\n That seemed the safer course, perhaps, but Wulfgar was up there, and Dagnabbit and the others were up there, and the townsfolk were up there, and if the orcs had indeed come on, the battle would be desperate.\\n\\n Catti-brie crawled to the side of the small chamber and began to claw at the stone, digging free several chunks and a mound of dirt and stone\\n\\n dust. Her fingers bled but she pushed on. The ground above her groaned ominously, but she pushed on, ignoring the exhaustion that crept through her as the minutes passed.\\n\\n She hit a rock too big for her to move. Undaunted, the woman started working at the side of the stone, and she jumped back as the rock suddenly shifted.\\n\\n Morning light streamed in as the boulder went away, hoisted and tossed aside by the strong arms of Wulfgar.\\n\\n He reached in for her and she gave him her hand and the barbarian gently pulled her from the small tunnel.\\n\\n \"Bruenor?\" Wulfgar asked desperately.\\n\\n \u0027\"He\u0027s the same,\" Catti-brie replied. \"The collapse didn\u0027t touch his room. Dwarves built it well.\"\\n\\n As she finished, the woman looked around at the devastation. The tower had half fallen over and half collapsed in on itself, and it had taken out several buildings on its toppling descent, leaving a long line of rubble. She wanted to ask so many questions then, about who had survived and who had fallen, but she could find no words, her jaw just drooping open.\\n\\n \"Dagnabbit is gone,\" Wulfgar informed her. \"Three other dwarves were lost with him, and at least five townsmen.\"\\n\\n Catti-brie continued her scan, hardly believing the devastation that had befallen the town. Most of the buildings were down or badly damaged, and little remained of the wall. When the orcs came on -and she knew it would be soon since she could hear their horns blowing and drums beating in the south-there would be no organized defense, just fighting from street to street, and before the bitter end, from tunnel to tunnel.\\n\\n She looked to Wulfgar and gathered strength from his stoic expression and his wide shoulders. He\u0027d kill more than a few before the orcs finished him, Catti-brie knew, and she decided that she would too. A wry smile widened on her face, and Wulfgar looked at her curiously.\\n\\n \"Well, if it\u0027s to end, then it\u0027s to end in a blaze o* fighting!\" she said, nodding and grinning.\\n\\n It was either that or fall down and weep.\\n\\n She put her hand on Wulfgar\u0027s shoulder, and he on hers.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re coming,\" came a voice behind them.\\n\\n They turned to see Tred, battered and bloody, but looking more than ready for a fight. The dwarf stood sidelong, one hand hidden behind his back, the other holding his double-bladed axe.\\n\\n Wulfgar pointed out several positions in a rough circle around the cave entrance leading back to Bruenor.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll hold these four positions,\" he explained, \"and fall back behind one pile after another to join up right here.\"\\n\\n \"And then?\" asked Tred.\\n\\n \"We fall back into the caves, or what\u0027s left of them,\" the barbarian said. \"Let the orcs crawl in and be killed until we are too weary to strike at them.\"\\n\\n Tred looked around, then nodded his agreement though he understood, as they all did, the ultimate futility of it all. Certainly some orcs, thirsty for blood, would foolishly come into the caves after them, but soon enough the wicked creatures would realize that time was on their side, that they could just wait out the return of the defenders, or even worse, that they could start fires and smoke the defenders out of the caves.\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll be me honor to die beside yer King Bruenor and to die beside the fine children of the king. He was a fine and brave one, that Dagnabbit,\" Tred said somberly, glancing over at the long pile of broken stone. \"Citadel Felbarr would\u0027ve been proud to call him one of our own. I\u0027m wishing we had the time to dig him out.\"\\n\\n \"It is a fitting grave,\" Wulfgar replied. \"Dagnabbit stood tall and defied them, and at the moment of his fall he called to the dwarf gods. He knew that he had done well. He knew that he had honored his people and his race.\"\\n\\n A solemn and silent moment passed, all three bowing their heads in deference to the fallen Dagnabbit.\\n\\n \"I got me some orcs to chop,\" Tred announced.\\n\\n He saluted the pair and moved off, organizing the remaining few into battle groups to defend three of the positions.\\n\\n Soon after, the bombardment increased once again but there was plenty of cover with so many piles of rubble, and there was little left to destroy. The giants\u0027 prelude seemed more an annoyance than anything else. The rain of boulders ended as the orcs, many riding worgs, came on, howling their battle cries.\\n\\n Catti-brie started the fight for the defenders, popping up from behind the rubble pile and letting fly a streaking arrow that hit a worg squarely in the head, stopping it in its tracks and launching its rider through the air. The woman let fly again to the side, for there was no shortage of targets with orcs swarming over the all but destroyed walls. She drove her arrows into their ranks, taking one, sometimes even two, down with every shot.\\n\\n But still they came on.\\n\\n \"Stay with the bow,\" Wulfgar instructed her.\\n\\n He rose up strong and tall and met the orcs\u0027 charge, Aegis-fang sweeping the leading orcs away, launching them through the air.\\n\\n All around the pair, the defenders of Shallows rose to meet the charge, humans and dwarves fighting desperately side by side. For a while, it seemed as if no orc\u0027s blow could fell any of them, as if any hit they suffered was a minor thing, shrugged off and retaliated immediately and brutally. Bodies piled all around the four defended positions, and almost all of them at first were orc and worg.\\n\\n The momentum couldn\u0027t hold, though, nor could the defense. The defenders, even in their desperate frenzy, knew it.\\n\\n Wulfgar swept his warhammer tirelessly, battering through any defenses the orcs trying to stand before him could possibly manage. Occasionally one of the creatures managed to slip under the blow, or duck back from it, but before the orc could them come on, a streaking silver arrow drove it down.\\n\\n Catti-brie put Taulmaril up again and again, her enchanted quiver never emptying. Whenever she could manage, she aimed for a worg instead of an orc, considering the snarling wolves to be the more dangerous foe. Most of the time, though, the woman didn\u0027t even bother to aim, nor did she have to.\\n\\n Even with that devastating line of fire, and with Wulfgar fighting more brilliantly and brutally than she had ever witnessed, the orcs, like the incoming tide, began to press in, swarming through holes.\\n\\n Catti-brie let fly an arrow, put another up and spun around, blasting away an orc point-blank. Another was there, though, and she had to take up her bow like a staff and fend the creature off.\\n\\n A second joined it, and she almost yelled for Wulfgar. Almost, but she held her words, realizing that any distraction to him would surely bring about his swift downfall. The woman whipped Taulmaril out before her viciously, back and forth, forcing the two orcs back. She dropped the bow and in the same fluid movement brought forth Khazid\u0027hea, her fine-edged sword.\\n\\n The orcs pressed on, a thrusting spear coming in hard at her right. A downward parry sheared the spear\u0027s tip cleanly off, and the orc, surprised by the lack of any real impact with the parry, overbalanced just a bit.\\n\\n Enough for Catti-brie to turn her hand over and stab out quickly, taking the creature in the chest.\\n\\n Back came Khazid\u0027hea, just in time to ring against the heavy blade of the second orc\u0027s sword. One on one, this creature would be no match for Catti-brie.\\n\\n But two others joined it, on either side, and Catti-brie was working furiously to fend off the trio. Behind her, she heard an impact, followed by Wulfgar\u0027s grunt.\\n\\n But she couldn\u0027t help him, and he couldn\u0027t help her.\\n\\n Catti-brie worked her blade all the more ferociously, turning aside thrust after stab after slash. Frustration grew within her, for she was making no headway, and she was working far too hard to maintain the pace.\\n\\n The orc before her and to the right moved suddenly, and in a way she could not have anticipated. At first, she thought the creature was charging her, but quickly she realized that it was just flying by, launched at the end of a heavy dwarven axe. Tred stepped forward behind it, launching a backhand that doubled over the second of the trio, the one standing right before Catti-brie. The woman reacted quickly, diverting all of her attention to the orc on her left. She came forward suddenly, turned Khazid\u0027hea over the orc\u0027s sword and down. The orc, both weapons down low, charged forward, trying to bowl her over, but the woman nimbly side-stepped the charge then stepped right past the orc. As the blades disengaged, she flipped her grip around and stabbed out behind her, severing the creature\u0027s spine.\\n\\n \"Defenses falling!\" Tred cried, running to join the battered Wulfgar and nearly getting his head torn off by one of Aegis-fang\u0027s wild swings. \"We\u0027re backing to the hole!\"\\n\\n Wulfgar grunted his accord and swiped away yet another orc, then fell back behind the rubble barricade.\\n\\n A worg came flying over it, leaping for his throat.\\n\\n Catti-brie, her bow retrieved, took the wolf in the flank, the powerfully enchanted arrow throwing it out to the side, quite dead.\\n\\n She looked up to see a horde of others charging in, though, and expected they would be overwhelmed quickly. She heard a noise behind her on the ground and turned to see old Withegroo, his features gaunt and strained. He could hardly stand, his body trembling from the exertion of even being upright, but the look in his eyes was not dull, and he moved his lips with determination wrought of sheer rage.\\n\\n His fireball stopped the charge of worg and orc, and brought the defenders a little more time, but the exertion cost Withegroo dearly. He managed a smile as he launched his devastating bomb, then he looked at Catti-brie and winked.\\n\\n He fell over, and before she even went to him the woman knew that he was dead.\\n\\n Withegroo\u0027s blast had defeated the charge of one flank, but the orcs did not scramble from the magical display. The dwindling defenders backed and backed some more, and when they heard horns blowing in the south they knew it was more orcs joining the already overwhelming odds.\\n\\n Or were those horns some other signal? the defenders had to wonder, as the press suddenly lightened. They were practically backed to the end of the line by then, with several already forced down into the tiny tunnels.\\n\\n The defenders of Shallows regrouped in a tight ring and battled on. Before long, Catti-brie and Wulfgar were back to their original defensive position, and this time with few orcs standing before them.\\n\\n Still the horns blew in the south, and as the fighting subsided, Wulfgar dared to run to the highest mound he could find and peered out that way.\\n\\n \"What in the Nine Hells?\" he called.\\n\\n Tred, Catti-brie, and a few others joined him, and their incredulity was no less intense. There, rolling north and pulled by a strange looking team of more than twenty straggly mules, came a huge wooden totem. It was a gigantic statue of an orc face, but with a singular, grotesque eye.\\n\\n \"Gruumsh,\" Tred McKnuckles said. He spat upon the ground as if the mere mention of the ore god put a foul taste in his mouth. \"They\u0027re bringing their clerics up,\" he reasoned. \"A ceremony for their final victory, I\u0027m guessin.\u0027\"\\n\\n The orcs that had been battling only moments before, filled the field to the south of the town, all pointing and cheering, many falling to their knees, prostrating themselves before the image of then\u0027 revered, and feared, god.\\n\\n Across the ravine, Drizzt heard the horns, though from his low vantage point creeping in on the giants\u0027 position, he couldn\u0027t see what the fuss was about. Even the giants standing up above him were talking excitedly, confused and pointing out to the south.\\n\\n Drizzt spotted Guenhwyvar across the way, moving in for an attack. He caught the cat\u0027s attention with a wave of his hand, and motioned for her to hold her position. He looked around, wondering how he could find a better vantage point without being seen. He started out but stopped almost immediately. The giants, not so startled anymore, were conversing angrily. He couldn\u0027t understand very much of what they were saying, but he recognized that they were somewhat put off by the orcs-he heard something about the orc priests stealing all their glory.\\n\\n A flicker of hope came to Drizzt that perhaps their enemies were about to split ranks, though he knew it was likely far too late to make any real difference.\\n\\n The driver, huddled under heavy robes, cracked his whip above the long line of pulling beasts, and the dirty and shaggy creatures tugged harder, propelling the huge wagon and great statue of Gruumsh One-Eye, god of the orcs, along the sloping and rocky ground.\\n\\n All of the orcs had turned their attention from Shallows, and the tiny pocket of hopelessly outnumbered defenders, to this new arrival. They bowed and fell to their knees in droves beside the wagon\u0027s course.\\n\\n \"What is this?\" one orc commander asked the leader of the army, Urlgen, son of Obould.\\n\\n Urlgen considered the strange scene with a perfectly confused expression, his tusks chewing at his lips.\\n\\n \"Obould has brought many allies,\" was all he could say, and all he could think.\\n\\n Was his father elevating the glory of this attack? Was he tying the attacks directly to some edict of the orc god\u0027s?\\n\\n Urlgen didn\u0027t know, and like the rest of his army his movements crept him closer to the great rolling statue. Unlike most of the others, though, Urlgen didn\u0027t focus entirely on that idol. He considered the curious team, perhaps the most unkempt and straggly looking team of ... of what? Urlgen didn\u0027t even really know what the creatures were. Mules? Small oxen? Rothe, perhaps, taken from the corridors of the Underdark?\\n\\n From there, the unusually smart orc scrutinized the drivers. One was taller and broader than the other, though both were short by orc standards. Perhaps the second-more a passenger than a driver, he seemed-was a child, but Urlgen couldn\u0027t really tell, since both wore heavy cloaks that included wide, low cowls.\\n\\n The wagon rolled to a stop some hundred or so feet from the town, which Urlgen thought rather foolish, since it left them in range of that horrible human woman and her nasty bow. The orc leader glanced back that way, and he did see several of the defenders watching, as were his own minions.\\n\\n The larger driver stood up and lifted his arms above his head. The sleeves of his cloak slipped down to reveal gnarly hands and a hairy forearm that didn\u0027t seem very orclike.\\n\\n Before anyone could truly take note of that, though, the driver grabbed a lever of some kind located on the front of the statue, right below the tusk-filled mouth.\\n\\n He said something that sounded like, \"Hee hee hee,\" and yanked the lever down.\\n\\n \"Well, here\u0027s one less priest for the damned Gruumsh,\" Catti-brie said with bitter determination.\\n\\n She lifted Taulmaril and leveled it the driver\u0027s way, but Tred grabbed her arm and stayed the shot.\\n\\n \"One won\u0027t be makin\u0027 any difference,\" he said, \"and something\u0027s not right about all this besides.\"\\n\\n Catti-brie started to ask what he meant, but in truth she could sense it too. Something about the team and the drivers struck her as odd, even from a distance.\\n\\n Her eyes widened when she heard the grinding sound that followed the orc shaman\u0027s pull of the lever, and they widened some more as the great statue seemed to grow, then split apart, the four sides breaking in the middle and falling out to form four wide planks.\\n\\n Out onto those planks, from the hollow inside of the statue, ran dwarves-many dwarves-in the full battle array of the unmistakable Gut-busters!\\n\\n One in particular led the way, wearing black, ridged armor and a helmet with a spike that was half again the height of the dwarf wearing it.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Pwent!\" Catti-brie cried.\\n\\n Even as she spoke, Thibbledorf Pwent leaped out, roaring and flailing. He ducked his head with perfect timing to skewer one orc as he landed atop another, smashing it to the ground. Catti-brie lost sight of him then but winced anyway, for she knew his technique. She knew that he was jostling about wildly atop the orc, his sharpened armor shredding it.\\n\\n His boys followed with equal abandon, running to the end of a plank and leaping wildly atop the confused throng of orcs. One after another they went, dwarven catapult balls raining death from on high. Even more dwarves appeared a moment later, throwing off camouflaging blankets that someone must have enchanted to make them look like a team of mules, and charging out from the yokes. How many fine targets they found in those first confusing seconds, with so many orcs kneeling on the ground, bowing forward.\\n\\n The massacre became a fight soon after, but even then the orcs were outmatched. Many were running, caught by surprise, and as was typical for any goblinkin, ranks broke apart at the first sign of retreat.\\n\\n The dwarven ranks stayed tight and strong and swept toward the town, with groups breaking away at the slightest sign of pursuit to chase off the orcs.\\n\\n \"Ye Battlehammers was always known for yer timing!\" Tred McKnuckles cried, then he yelped and leaped aside as a great rock smashed down and bounced past.\\n\\n \"Damn giants again!\" the dwarf cried.\\n\\n Catti-brie ran to the remnants of the northern wall and lifted her bow.\\n\\n \"Move as you shoot!\" Wulfgar warned, and indeed, as soon as the first arrow made its way out across the ravine, a volley of great stones came in at the position where the arrow had been fired.\\n\\n It did Drizzt Do\u0027Urden\u0027s heart good to see those telltale arrows sailing across the ravine, but even that good news-that Catti-brie was apparently still fighting-did not distract him from his course. The giants had started their bombardment in full force again, and that, he knew, he could not allow. He called Guenhwyvar into action, then scrambled up to the side of the giants\u0027 position himself., moving high up on a pile of boulders unnoticed by the behemoths.\\n\\n The drow advanced without a sound, leaping out and crossing behind one giant, his scimitars slashing hard. He hit the ground running, executing a perfect double stab at the back of another\u0027s knee, and kept right on going, around the rocks on the other side.\\n\\n Giants turned to follow, and one lifted its arms to throw a stone at the fleeing drow.\\n\\n Instead of executing the throw, the giant caught a flying panther in its face-all six hundred pounds of raking claws. Guenhwyvar went for the eyes, not the kill, and scraped them deep, blinding the giant before leaping aside.\\n\\n All the giants were scrambling, but Drizzt held no illusions that he and Guenhwyvar could keep them occupied for long. Nor did he think that he could possibly kill many, even any, of them, but maybe he and the panther could blind a few or get a few to chase them away.\\n\\n He came back around the rocks the same way he had gone in and did indeed catch the closest giant off its guard, managing another few nasty stabs before scrambling the other way. The pursuit was better this time, though-was too good -with giants flanking both ways and another pair pursuing directly.\\n\\n Drizzt moved to put his back to a wall, ready to make a final, desperate stand.\\n\\n The nearest giant charged in.\\n\\n Before it got to Drizzt, though, the behemoth winced and grabbed at its neck. As it spun around, the dark elf clearly saw the feathered fletching of a pair of arrows buried in the giant\u0027s neck. Drizzt\u0027s jaw dropped open when the brute moved just a bit to the side.\\n\\n There, up above him to the north, sat a pair of elves astride flying horses.\\n\\n The giants scrambled.\\n\\n Drizzt rushed out to the side, stabbed yet another, then kept on running, leaping past some boulders. Few giants paid him any heed, though. A couple off to the side were still futilely trying to keep up with Guenhwyvar as the panther leaped all around them. Several of the others were moving fast for more rocks -to throw at the elves, obviously.\\n\\n Drizzt couldn\u0027t let them get organized. He moved to the rock pile on the west. When one giant stooped and reached for a stone, he leaped out, slashing the behemoth hard across its fingers. The giant retracted the hand, and it, and a companion, gave chase on the drow.\\n\\n This time Drizzt didn\u0027t turn and didn\u0027t slow, leading the giants off and yelling for Guenhwyvar to do the same across the way. The drow ranger saw a stone go flying into the air and heard the shriek of a pegasus a moment later, though when he looked to the north, both elves were still up there, flying around and firing their bows.\\n\\n Drizzt sprinted out across some open ground, often glancing back at the destroyed town, hoping to catch some sign of his friends.\\n\\n He saw nothing definitive, just a swarm of orcs charging for the town. Drizzt had to turn away, running to the north with a pair of giants close behind him.\\n\\n \"We got no time!\" Thibbledorf Pwent cried, charging into Shallows. \"Gather up yer things and yer wounded and follow me to the wagon!\"\\n\\n \"We need a cleric!\" Wulfgar yelled at him. \"At once! We\u0027ve wounded too badly hurt to be moved!\"\\n\\n \"Then ye might need to leave \"em!\" Pwent yelled back..\\n\\n \"One of them is Bruenor Battlehammer!\" Wulfgar yelled back.\\n\\n \"Cleric!\" yelled Pwent. \"And get the one on the wagon with the green beard,\" the battlerager cried to another dwarf. \"He\u0027s got more tricks than a den o\u0027 drunken wizards.\"\\n\\n \"Get \u0027em moving!\" another dwarf cried. \"Get the wounded on the wagon and get all the dead dwarfs ye can up there with \u0027em. We\u0027re not for leaving Battlehammers behind for the buzzards or the orcs!\"\\n\\n \"How did ye find us so fast?\" Catti-brie started to ask Pwent, but she stopped and smiled when she saw the obvious source of the daring rescue. The second driver, the little one, whom she recognized clearly once his cowl was pulled back. \"Regis,\" the woman said.\\n\\n With her heart busting, she moved to hug him but backed away quickly when she saw him wince as she put pressure against his arm.\\n\\n \"Someone had to feed the wolf,\" the halfling said with a sheepish shrug.\\n\\n Catti-brie bent low and kissed him on the head, and Regis blushed deeply.\\n\\n And they were moving, a whirlwind of scrambling dwarf warriors buzzing like a swarm of angry bees around the exhausted defenders of Shallows, a ragtag group. Of the hundred humans and twenty-six dwarves who had begun the defense of the town, less than a score were leaving of their own strength, and only another ten, Bruenor among them, were still drawing breath at all.\\n\\n Hardly a victory. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-thousand-orcs-hunter-s-blades-1/page-29.html","bookId":2140,"book":{"id":2140,"title":"The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1)","description":"Storyline: The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1) \\n This mass market reprint focuses primarily on his signature character, Drizzt Doourden, who has been the subject of most of Salvatore\u0027s best-selling titles for Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
