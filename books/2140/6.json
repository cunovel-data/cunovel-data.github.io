{"id":95611,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"The troupe crossed the bridge to the south of Mirabar, then followed the River Mirar to the east of the city for a tenday of easy marching. South of them loomed the tall trees of Lurkwood, a forest known to harbor many orc tribes and other unpleasant neighbors. To the north stood the towering mountains of the Spine of the World, their tops holding defiantly white against the coming summer season. The grass grew tall around them, and dandelions dotted the rolling fields of the Valley of Khedrun, but the ever-vigilant dwarves were not lulled by the peaceful season and scenery. This far to the north, anywhere outside of a city had to be considered untamed land, so they doubled their guard every night, circled their wagons, and kept Drizzt, Catti-brie, and Wulfgar working the flanks. Guenhwyvar joined the trio in their scouting whenever Drizzt was able to summon her. At the eastern end of the valley, with nearly a hundred miles between them and Mirabar, the River Mirar bent to the north, flowing from the foothills of the Spine of the World. The Lurkwood, meanwhile, also bent to the north, following the line of the river as if shadowing the water, several miles to the south. \"Ground\u0027s gonna get tougher,\" Bruenor warned them all as they set camp that night. \"We\u0027ll be back in the foothills tomorrow by midday, and moving tight under the shadows o\u0027 the forest.\" He looked around at his clan, to see every head nodding stoically. \"Next days\u0027ll be tougher,\" Bruenor told them, and not a one batted an eye. They broke their gathering, and went back to their posts. \"The road\u0027s not so bad, by my measuring Delly Curtie said to Wulfgar when he joined her and Colson, their young daughter, at the small lean-to Delly had set beside a wagon. \"No meaner than Luskan\u0027s streets.\" \"We\u0027ve been fortunate so far,\" Wulfgar replied, holding his arms out to take Colson, whom Delly gladly gave over. Wulfgar looked down at the tiny girl, the daughter of Meralda Feringal, the Lady of Auckney, a small town nestled in the Spine of the World not far to the west of the pass that had brought the troupe out of Icewind Dale. Wulfgar had rescued Colson from the trials of Lord Feringal and his tyrannical sister, retribution against the bastard child since Colson was not Feringal\u0027s daughter. The Lord of Auckney had thought Wulfgar the father, for Meralda had concocted a lie to protect the man\u0027s honor, claiming that she had been raped on the road. But Wulfgar was not the father, had never known Meralda in that manner. Looking at Colson, though, at the tiny creature who had become so precious to him, he wished that he was. He looked up from Colson to see Delly staring at him lovingly, and he knew that he was a lucky man indeed. \"Ye going out with Drizzt and Catti-brie tonight?\" Delly asked. Wulfgar shook his head. \"We\u0027re too close to the Lurkwood. Drizzt and Catti-brie can keep the watch well enough without me.\" \"Ye\u0027re staying close because ye\u0027re afraid for me and Colson,\" Delly reasoned, and Wulfgar didn\u0027t disagree. The woman reached to take the baby back, but Wulfgar rolled his shoulder to block her hands, grinning at her all the time. \"Ye cannot be forsaking yer duties for me own sake,\" Delly complained, and Wulfgar laughed at her. \"This,\" he said, presenting the baby, then pulling her back in close when Delly reached for her, \"is my duty, first and foremost. Drizzt and Catti-brie know it, too. We are close to the Lurkwood now, and that means close to orcs. You might be thinking that Luskan\u0027s streets are meaner than the wilds because you\u0027ve not yet truly seen the wilds. If the orcs come upon us in numbers, the blood will flow. Ore blood, mostly, but with dwarf blood mixed in. You\u0027ve never witnessed a battle, my love, and I hope it stays like that, but out here. . . .\" He let it go at that, shaking his head. \"And if the orcs come for us, yell be there keeping them off me and Colson,\" Delly reasoned. Wulfgar, determined, looked at her then down at Colson who was sleeping angelically in his arms. His smile widened. \"No orc, no giant, no dragon will harm you,\" he promised the babe, lifting his eyes to include Delly as well. Delly started to respond, and Wulfgar was sure she meant to offer one of her typically sarcastic remarks, but she didn\u0027t. She stopped short and just stood there staring at him, even offering a little nod to show that she did not doubt him. As Bruenor had warned, the traveling got much more difficult the next day, with grassy meadows giving way to boulder-strewn trails climbing into the foothills. The ground was flatter to the south, but veering there would have put the dwarves into the thick underbrush and dangerous shadows of the Lurkwood, home to many unfriendly beasts. With so many sturdy dwarves in the caravan, Bruenor decided to keep them out in the open, (o let any enemies understand the power of the force. The dwarves did not complain, and when they came upon a gully or a particularly broken stretch over which the wagons could not roll, a host of dwarves moved up beside each cart, lifting it in their strong hands and carrying it across. That was their way, an attitude of logical stoicism and pragmatism that cut long tunnels through hard rock, one inch at a time. Watching them at their march, Drizzt understood well the kind of determination and long-range thinking that had produced such beautiful and marvelous places as Mithral Hall. It was the same patience that had allowed one such as Bruenor to create Aegis-fang, to deliberately engrave perfect representations of the trio of dwarf gods on the hammer\u0027s head, where one errant scratch would have ruined the whole process. Soon after the second day out of Khedrun Pass, with the trees of the Lurkwood so near that the group could hear birds singing in the boughs, a cry from the front confirmed Bruenor\u0027s other fear. \"Ores outta the woods!\" \"Form yer battle groups!\" Bruenor called. \"Group One Left, make yer wedge!\" Dagnabbit shouted. \"One Right, square up!\" To the left, farthest from the woods, Drizzt and Catti-brie watched the precision of the veteran dwarf warriors and saw the small band of orcs rushing out of the forest, making for the lead wagons. The orcs hadn\u0027t scouted their intended target properly, it seemed, for once they cleared the brush and saw the scope of the force allayed before them, they skidded to a stop and fell all over each other in fast retreat. How different were their movements from those of the calm, skilled dwarves -well, almost all of the dwarves. Ignoring the calls of Bruenor and Dagnabbit, Thibbledorf Pwent and his Gutbusters assembled into their own formation, unique to their tactics. They called it a charge, but to Drizzt and Catti-brie it more resembled an avalanche. Pwent and his boys whooped, hollered, and scrambled headlong into the darkness of the forest shadows in pursuit of the orcs, leaping through the first line of brush with gleeful abandon. \"The orcs may have set a trap,\" Catti-brie warned, \"showing us but a small part o\u0027 their force to drag us into their webs.\" Cries resounded within the boughs, just south of the caravan, and flora and fauna, and orc body parts, began to fly wildly all about the area the Gutbusters had entered. \"Stupid orcs, then,\" Drizzt replied. He started down from the higher ground, Catti-brie in tow, to join Bruenor. When they reached the king, they found him standing on his wagon bench, hands on his hips, and with groups of properly arrayed dwarves in tight formations al I around him. One wedge of warriors passed skillfully by the defensive squares two others had assembled. \"Ain\u0027t ye going to join the fun?\" Bruenor asked. Drizzt looked back at the forest, at the continuing tumult, a volcano come to life, and shook his head. \"Too dangerous,\" the drow explained. \"Damn Pwent makes it hard to see the point o\u0027 discipline,\" Bruenor grumbled to his friends. He winced, and so did Drizzt and Catti-Brie, and Regis who was standing near to Bruenor, when an orc came flying out of the underbrush to land face down on the clearer ground in front of the dwarves. Before any of Bruenor\u0027s boys could react, they heard a wild roar from back within the boughs, up high, and stared in blank amazement as Thibbledorf Pwent, high up in a tree, ran out to the end of one branch and leaped out long and far. The orc was just beginning to rise when Pwent landed on its back, blasting it back down to the ground. Likely it was already dead, but the wild battlerager, with broken branches and leaves stuck all about his ridged armor, went into his devastating body shake, turning the orc into a bloody mess. Pwent hopped up, then hopped all around. \"Ye can get \u0027em moving again, me king!\" he yelled back to Bruenor. \"We\u0027ll be done here soon enough.\" \"And the Lurkwood will never be the same,\" Drizzt mumbled. \"If I was a squirrel anywhere around here, I\u0027d be thinking of making meself a new home,\" Catti-brie concurred. \"I\u0027d pay a big bird to fly me far away,\" Regis added. \"Should we hold the positions?\" Dagnabbit called to Bruenor. \"Nah, get the wagons moving,\" the dwarf king replied with a wave of his hand. \"We stay here and we\u0027ll all get splattered.\" Pwent and his boys, some hurt but hardly caring, rejoined their fellows a short while later, singing songs of victory and battle. Nothing serious emanated from this group. Their songs sounded more like the joyful rhymes of children at play. \"Watching Pwent makes me wonder if I wasted my youth with all that training,\" Drizzt said to Catti-brie later on, the pair patrolling with Guenhwyvar along the northern foothills again. \"Yeah, ye could\u0027ve just whiled away the hours banging yer head against a stone wall, like Pwent and his boys did.\" \"Without a helmet?\" \"Aye,\" the woman confirmed, keeping a straight face. \"Though I\u0027m thinking that Bruenor made him armor the poor wall. Protecting the structural integrity of the realm.\" \"Ah,\" said Drizzt, nodding, then just shaking his head helplessly. No more orc bands made any appearances against the caravan throughout the rest of that day, nor over the next few. The going was difficult and slow, but still, not a dwarf complained, even when they had to spend the better part of a rainy day moving the remnants of an old rockslide from the trail. As the days wore on, though, more and more rumbles began to filter through the line of wagons, for it became obvious to them all that Bruenor wasn\u0027t planning a turn to the south anytime soon. \"Ores,\" Catti-brie remarked, examining the partial footprint in the dirt of a high trail. The woman looked up and all around, as if gauging the wind and the air. \"Few days, maybe.\" \"At least a few,\" replied Drizzt, who was a short distance away, leaning on a boulder with his arms crossed over his chest, scrutinizing the woman\u0027s work as if he knew something that she did not. \"What?\" the woman asked, catching the non-verbal cue. \"Perhaps I have a wider picture of it,\" Drizzt answered. Catti-brie narrowed her eyes as she stared hard at the drow, matching his mischievous grin with a thin-lipped one of her own. She started to say something less than complimentary, but then caught on that perhaps the drow was speaking literally. She stood up and stepped back, taking in the area of the footprint from a wider viewpoint. Only then did she realize that the orc print was beside the mark of a much larger boot. Much larger. \"Ore was here first,\" she stated without hesitation. \"How do you know that?\" Drizzt wasn\u0027t playing the part of instructor here, but rather, he seemed genuinely curious as to how the woman had come to that. \"Giant might be chasin\u0027 the orc, but I\u0027m doubting that the orc\u0027s chasing the giant.\" \"How do you know they weren\u0027t traveling together?\" Catti-brie looked back to the tracks. \"Not a hill giant,\" she explained, for it was well known that hill giants often allied with orcs. \"Too big.\" \"Mountain giant, perhaps,\" said Drizzt. \"Larger version of the same creature.\" Catti-brie shook her head doubtfully. Most mountain giants typically didn\u0027t even wear boots, covering their feet with skin wraps, if at all. The sharp definitions of the giant heel print made her believe that this particular boot was well made. Even more telling, the foot was narrow, relatively speaking, whereas mountain giants were known to have huge, wide feet. \"Stone giants might be wearin\u0027 boots,\" the woman reasoned, \"and frost giants always do.\" \"So you think the giant was chasing the orc?\" The woman looked over at Drizzt again and shrugged. With it put so plainly - Drizzt apparently wasn\u0027t questioning her-she realized just how shaky that theory truly was. \"Could be,\" she said, \"or they might \"ye just passed this way independent of each other. Or they might be workin\u0027 together.\" \"A frost giant and an orc?\" came the skeptical question. \"A woman and a drow?\" came the snide response, and Drizzt laughed. The pair moved on without much concern. The tracks were not fresh, and even if it was an orc or a group of orcs, and a giant or two besides, they\u0027d think twice before attacking an army of five hundred dwarves. It was slow and it was hot and it was dry, but no more monsters showed themselves to the force as the dwarves stubbornly made their way to the east. They climbed up one dusty trail, the sun hot on their backs, but when they crested the ridge and started down the backside, all the world seemed to change. A vast, rocky vale loomed before them, with towering mountains both north and south. Shadows dotted the valley, and even in those places where there seemed no obstacle to block the sunlight, the ground appeared dull, dour, and somehow mysterious. Wisps of fog flitted about the valley, though there was no obvious water source, and little dew-catching grass could be seen, Bruenor, Regis, Dagnabbit, and Wulfgar and his family led the way down the backside of the ridge to find Drizzt and Catti-brie waiting for their wagon. \"Ye\u0027re not likin\u0027 what ye\u0027re seein\u0027 Bruenor asked Drizzt, noticing a disconcerted expression on the face of the normally cool drow. Drizzt shook his head, as if he couldn\u0027t put it into words. \"A strange feeling,\" he explained, or tried to. He looked back toward the gloomy vale and shook his head again. \"I\u0027m feelin\u0027 it too,\" Catti-brie chimed in. \"Like we\u0027re bein\u0027 looked at.\" \"Ye probably are,\" Bruenor said. He cracked the whip and sent his team, which also seemed more than a little skittish, moving down the trail. The dwarf gave a laugh, but those around him didn\u0027t seem so comfortable, particularly Wulfgar, who kept looking back at Delly and Colson. \"Your wagon should not be in the front,\" Drizzt reminded Bruenor. \"As I been telling him,\" Dagnabbit agreed. Bruenor only snorted and drove the team on, calling back to the next wagons in line and to the soldiers flanking them. \"Bah, they\u0027re all hesitating,\" Bruenor complained. \"Can ye not feel it?\" Dagnabbit asked. \"Feel it? I\u0027m swimmin\u0027 in it, shortbeard! We\u0027ll put up right down there,\" he conceded, pointing to a flat, open area just below, about a third of the way down the side of the ridge, \"then ye get \u0027em all about and I\u0027ll give them the tale.\" \"The tale?\" Catti-brie asked, the same question that all the others were about to voice. \"The tale o\u0027 the pass,\" Bruenor explained. \"The Fell Pass.\" It was a name that meant little to Bruenor\u0027s Icewind Dale non-dwarf companions, but Dagnabbit blanched at the mention -as much as the others had ever seen a dwarf blanch. Still, Dagnabbit performed as instructed, and with typical efficiency, bringing the wagons in line from the ridge top to the plateau Bruenor had indicated. When the dwarves had finished their bustling and jostling, setting their teams in place and finding acceptable vantage points to hear the words of their leader, Bruenor climbed up on a wagon and called out to them all. \"Ye\u0027re smellin\u0027 ghosts, and that\u0027s what\u0027s got ye itching,\" he explained. \"And ye should be smellin\u0027 ghosts, for the valley here is thick with them. Ghosts o\u0027 Delzoun dwarves, long dead, killed in battle by orcs.\" He swept his arm out to the east, to the wide pass opening before them. \"And what a battle she was! Hunnerds o\u0027 yer ancestors died here, me boys, and thousands and thousands o\u0027 their enemies. But ye keep yerselfs strong in heart. We won the Battle o\u0027 Fell Pass, and so if ye\u0027re seeing any o\u0027 them ghosts down there on our way through, ye taunt it if it\u0027s an orc and ye bow to it if it\u0027s a dwarf!\" The other friends from Icewind Dale watched Bruenor with sincere admiration, noting how he added just the right inflections to his voice, and emphasis on key words to hold his clan in deep attention. He was acknowledging that there might be supernatural things down in the reputedly haunted valley, yet if there was an ounce of fear in Bruenor Battlehammer, he did not show it. \"Now we could\u0027ve gone further south,\" he went on. \"Coulda swung along the northern edge o\u0027 the Trollmoors and into Nesme.\" He paused and shook his head, then gave a great, \"Bah!\" Drizzt and the others surveyed the audience, noting that many, many bearded heads were bobbing in agreement with that dismissive sentiment. \"But I knowed me boys\u0027d have little trouble walking among the dead heroes of old,\" Bruenor finished. \"Ye won\u0027t embarrass Clan Battlehammer. Now ye get yer teams moving. We\u0027ll bring the wagons in a tight double line across the pass, and if ye\u0027re seeing a dwarf of old, ye be remembering yer manners!\" The army swung into precise action, sorting the wagons and moving them along the trail, down to the floor of the wide pass. They tightened their ranks, as Bruenor had instructed, and rolled along two-by-two. Before the last of the wagons had even begun moving, one of the dwarves struck up a marching song, a heroic tale of an ancient battle not unlike the one that had taken place in Fell Pass. In moments, all the line had joined in the song, their voices strong and steady, defeating the chilling atmosphere of the haunted place. \"Even if there are ghosts about,\" Drizzt whispered to Catti-brie, \"they\u0027ll be too afraid to come out and bother this group.\" Just to the side of them, Delly was equally at ease with Wulfgar. \"And ye keep telling me how ugly the road can be,\" she scolded. \"And here I was, all afraid.\" Wulfgar gave her a concerned look. \"I never known a better place to be,\" Delly said to him. \"And how ye could e\u0027er have thought o\u0027 giving up this life for one in the miserable city, I\u0027m not for knowing!\" \"Nor are we,\" Catti-brie agreed, drawing a surprised look from the barbarian. She returned Wulfgar\u0027s stare with a disarming smile. \"Nor are we.\" The wind moaned-perhaps it was the wind, perhaps something else-but the sound seemed like a fitting accompaniment to the continuing song. Many white stones covered the area-or at least, the dwarves thought they were stones at first, until one of them looked closer and realized that they were bones. Ore bones and dwarf bones, skulls and femurs, some laying out in the open, others half-buried. Scattered about them were pieces of rusted metal, broken swords, and rotted armor. It seemed like the former owners, of both bones and armor, might still be about as well, for sometimes the wisps of strange fog seemed to take on definitive shapes-that of a dwarf, perhaps, or an orc. Clan Battlehammer, lost in the rousing song and following their unshakable leader, merely saluted the former and sang all the louder, growled away the latter and sang all the louder. They set their camp that night, wagons circled, nervous horses brought right into the center, with a ring of torches all around the tight perimeter. Still the dwarves sang, to ward off the ghosts that might be lurking nearby. \"Ye don\u0027t go out this night,\" Bruenor instructed Drizzt and Catti-brie, \"and don\u0027t bring up yer stupid cat, elf.\" That brought him a couple of puzzled expressions. \"No plane-shifting around here,\" Bruenor explained. \"And that\u0027s what yer cat does.\" \"You fear that Guenhwyvar will open a portal that unwelcome visitors might also use?\" \"Talked to me priests and we\u0027re all agreein\u0027 it\u0027s better not to find out.\" Drizzt nodded and settled back. \"All the more reason for me and Drizzt to go out and keep a scouting perimeter,\" Catti-brie reasoned. \"I ain\u0027t suggesting that.\" \"Why?\" \"What do you know, Bruenor?\" Drizzt prompted. He moved in closer, and so did Catti-brie, and so did Regis, who was nearby and eavesdropping. \"She\u0027s a haunted pass, to be sure,\" Bruenor confided, after taking a moment to look all around. \"Full o\u0027 yer ancestors,\" said Catti-brie. \"Full o\u0027 worse than that,\" said Bruenor. \"We\u0027re to be fine-too many of us for even them ghosts to be playing with, I\u0027m guessing.\" \"Guessing?\" Regis echoed skeptically. Bruenor only shrugged and turned back to Drizzt. \"We\u0027re needin\u0027 to get an idea o\u0027 all the land about,\" he explained. \"You think that Gauntlgrym is near?\" Another shrug. \"Doubtin\u0027 that-it\u0027d be more toward Mirabar-but we\u0027re likely to find some clues here. That fight them centuries ago was going the orcs\u0027 way-a bad time for me ancestors-but then the dwarves outsmarted them... not a tough thing to do! There\u0027s tunnels all about this pass, and deep caves, some natural, others cut by the Delzoun. Me ancient kin interlocked them all and used them to supply, to bind their wounds, and to fix their weapons -and for surprise, for the dwarfs lured them stupid orcs in on what looked like a small group, and when them ugly beasts came charging, their tongues flapping outside their ugly mouths, the Delzoun popped up from trapdoors all about them, within their ranks. \u0027Was still a fierce fight. Them orcs can hit hard, no one\u0027s doubting, and many, many o\u0027 me ancestors died here, but me kin won out. Killed most o\u0027 them orcs and sent the others running back to their holes in the deeper mountains. Them caves are likely still down there, holding secrets I mean to learn.\" \"And holding nasties of many shapes and sizes,\" Catti-brie added. \"Someone\u0027s gotta clear them nasties away,\" Bruenor agreed. \"Might as well be me.\" \"You mean Hi-,\" Regis corrected. Bruenor gave him a sly smile. \"You plan to find a way down there and take the army underground?\" Drizzt asked. \"Nan. I\u0027m plannin\u0027 on passing through, as I said. We\u0027ll go back to Mithral Hall and get through with the formalities, then we\u0027ll decide how many we should be bringing back out after the next winter blows past. We\u0027ll see what we can find.\" \"Then why go through here now?\" \"Think about it, elf,\" Bruenor answered, looking around at the encampment, which seemed fairly calm and at ease, despite their location. \"Ye look danger right in the face, at its worst-or what ye\u0027re thinking to be its worst-right up front, and ye\u0027re not to be caught off yer guard by fear no more.\" Indeed, in looking around at the settled camp, Drizzt understood exactly what Bruenor was driving at. The night was not completely restful, and more than once, a sentry team cried out, \"Ghost!\" and the dwarves and others scrambled. There were sightings and shrieks from unseen sources out in the darkness. Despite their weariness from the road, the clan did not get a good night\u0027s sleep, but they were back on the move in the morning, singing their songs, denying fear as only a dwarf could. \"Dreadmont and Skyfire,\" Bruenor explained to his friends the next day, pointing out two mountains, one to the south and one to the north. \"Markin\u0027 the pass. Ye take in every landmark, elf. I\u0027ll be needing yer ranger nose if we\u0027re finding a place worth a return visit.\" That day went uneventfully, and the troupe passed another fitful, but not overly so, night and were back on the road before the dawn. At mid-morning, they were rolling along at a brisk pace, singing their songs from front to back, the battleragers and other soldiers trotting along easily. But then the wagon beside Bruenor\u0027s lurched suddenly, its back right wheel dropping, and its front left coming right off the ground. The horses reared and whinnied, and the poor drivers fought hard to hold it steady. Dwarves rushed in from the side, grabbing on, some trying to catch the cargo that was sliding off the back, sliding into a gaping hole that was opening in the ground like a hungry mouth. Drizzt rushed across in front of Bruenor\u0027s wagon and darted back behind the frightened, rearing horses, who were being dragged back with the rest of the wagon. His scimitars flashed repeatedly, cutting loose the harness, saving the team. Catti-brie ran past the drow, heading for the drivers, and Wulfgar leaped from Bruenor\u0027s wagon to join her. The wagon fell backward into the hole, taking the two struggling dwarves and the woman who had rushed to rescue them into the darkness. Without even hesitating, Wulfgar dived down to his chest at the lip of the hole and reached out, catching the remains of the horse harness in his powerful hands. The wagon wasn\u0027t falling free. If it had been, Wulfgar would have disappeared along with it. Rather, it was slipping down along a rocky shaft, and enough of its weight was supported from below so that Wulfgar somehow managed to tentatively secure it. The growling barbarian nearly let go in shock when a diminutive figure ran past him and leaped headlong into the hole, and behind him, Drizzt did cry out for Regis. Then both noticed that the halfling was tethered, and with Bruenor standing secure on his wagon, holding the other end of the line. \"Got them!\" came a cry from below. Dagnabbit and several other dwarves joined Bruenor, taking up the line and locking it in place. Catti-brie was the first to climb out along the lifeline, followed in short order by the two shaken and bruised but not badly hurt drivers. \"Rumblebelly?\" Bruenor called when the other three were out with no sign of the halfling. \"Lots of tunnels down here!\" came Regis cry, cut short by a shriek. That was all the dwarf team had to hear, and they began pumping their powerful arms, hoisting a very shaken Regis from the hole. Wulfgar could hold the wagon no longer. It went crashing down, disappearing from view, until the clatter of its descent became a distant thing. \"What\u0027d ye see?\" Bruenor and many others yelled at Regis, who was as white as an autumn cloud. Regis shook his head, his eyes wide and unblinking. \"I thought it was you,\" he said to one of the drivers. \"I... I went to hand you the rope. It went right through ... I mean, it didn\u0027t touch ... I mean.\" \"Easy, Rumblebelly,\" Bruenor said, patting the halfling on the shoulder. \"Ye\u0027re safe enough here and now.\" Regis nodded but didn\u0027t seem convinced. Off to the side, Delly gave Wulfgar a huge hug and kiss. \"Ye done good,\" she whispered to him. \"If ye hadn\u0027t caught the wagon, then all three would\u0027ve crashed down to their deaths.\" Wulfgar looked past her to Catti-brie, who was standing comfortably in Drizzt\u0027s embrace but was looking Wulfgar\u0027s way and nodding appreciatively. Surveying the scene, recognizing that many were thoroughly shaken, Bruenor Battlehammer walked over to the edge of the hole, put his hands on his hips, and yelled down, \"Hey, ye damned ghosties! Ye got nothing more about ye than a wisp of smoke?\" A chorus of moans rolled out of the hole, and dwarves scrambled away. Not Bruenor, though. \"Oo, ye got me shaking in me boots now!\" he taunted. \"Well, if ye got something to say, then get up here and say it. Otherwise, shut yer traps!\" The moans stopped, and for a short, uncomfortable moment, not a dwarf moved or made the slightest sound, all of them wondering if Bruenor\u0027s challenge was about to be met by a wave of attacking ghosts. As the seconds slipped by and nothing ominous crawled out of the hole, the troupe settled back. \"Ye get Pwent and his boys tethered together on long lines and out in front, stomping the ground as they go,\" Bruenor instructed Dagnabbit. \"Don\u0027t want to be losin\u0027 any more wagons.\" The team went back into action, and Drizzt moved near his dwarf friend. \"Challenging the dead?\" he asked. \"Bah, they don\u0027t mean nothing with their booing and floating about. Probably don\u0027t even know they\u0027re dead.\" \"True enough.\" \"Mark well this spot, elf,\" Bruenor instructed. \"I\u0027m thinking that it might be a good place to start our hunt for Gauntlgrym.\u0027\u0027 With that, the unshakable Bruenor moved back to his wagon, patted Regis on the shoulder one more time, then led the clan forward as if nothing had happened. \"Roll on. Bruenor Battlehammer,\" Drizzt whispered. \"Don\u0027t he always?\" Catti-brie asked, moving beside the drow and wrapping her arm comfortably around his waist. It took them three days to cross the broken ground of the Fell Pass. The ghosts hovered around them every step of the way and the wind did not cease its mournful song. Some areas were relatively clear, but others were thick with remnants of that long-ago battle. The signs weren\u0027t always physical, often just a general feeling of loss and pain, a thick, tangible aura of a land haunted by many lost souls. Late that third day, up high on one ridge, Catti-brie spotted a distant, welcomed sight, a silvery river running through the land to the east like a giant snake. \"The Surbrin,\" Bruenor said with a smile when she told him, and all heads about began to bob in recognition, for the great River Surbrin passed only a few miles to the east of Mithral Hall, and the dwarves had actually opened an eastern gate right along its banks. \"Couple o\u0027 days and we\u0027ll be home,\" the dwarf explained, and a great cheer went up for King Bruenor, who had conquered the Fell Pass. \"I\u0027m still not figuring why ye took us this way, if ye\u0027re just meaning to go home anyway,\" Catti-brie confided to the dwarf as the excitement continued around them. \"Because I\u0027m coming back out here, and so\u0027re yerself, the elf, Rumblebelly, and Wulfgar if he\u0027s wanting it. And so\u0027re Dagnabbit and some o\u0027 me best shield dwarves. Now we\u0027re knowing the ground, and we learned it under the protection of an army. Now we can start our looking.\" \"Ye think the leaders in Mithral Hall are to let ye go out and run free?\" Catti-brie asked. \"Ye\u0027re their king, ye might be remembering.\" \"Are they to let me? Well, I\u0027m their king, ye might be remembering,\" Bruenor shot back. \"I\u0027m not thinking that I\u0027m needing anyone\u0027s permission, girl, and so what makes ye think I\u0027m to be askin\u0027?\" There wasn\u0027t really much that Catti-brie could say against that. \"Ain\u0027t ye supposed to be out hunting with Drizzt?\" Bruenor asked. \"He took Regis with him today,\" Catti-brie answered, and she looked to the north, as if she expected to spot the pair running along a distant ridgeline. \"The halfling howl about going?\" \"No. He asked if he could go.\" \"Still wonderin\u0027 what\u0027s got into Rumblebelly,\" Bruenor admitted with a shake of his hairy head. Regis, once the lover of comfort, did indeed seem transformed. He had pressed on through the bitter cold of winter in the Spine of the World without complaint, indeed even lending rousing words for his friends. In every action, the halfling had tried to get involved, to somehow help out, whereas the Regis of old seemed amazingly adept at finding an out of the way shadow. The change was somehow unsettling to Bruenor and to all the others, a shifting of the sand beneath the world as they had known it. At least it seemed to be shifting in a positive direction. Not so far away, Wulfgar came upon Delly as she watched Catti-brie and Bruenor in their private discussion. The barbarian noted that his wife was focusing almost exclusively on Catti-brie, as if taking a measure of the woman. He walked up behind her and wrapped his huge arms around her waist. \"She is a fine companion,\" he said. \"I can see why ye loved her.\" Wulfgar gently turned Delly around to face him. \"I did not...\" \"Oh, sure ye did, and stop trying to save me feelings!\" Wulfgar stammered over a couple of responses, not knowing how he should respond. \"She is a companion to me, on the road, in battle . . .\" \"And in all yer life,\" Delly finished. \"No,\" Wulfgar insisted. \"Once I thought that I desired such a joining, but now I see the world differently. Now I see you, and Colson, and know that I am complete.\" \"Who said ye weren\u0027t?\" \"You just said . . .\" \"I said that yer Catti-brie was a companion in all yer life, and so she is, and so ye\u0027re better off for it,\" Delly corrected. \"Ye don\u0027t be pullin\u0027her back from yerself for me own sake!\" \"I do not wish to hurt you.\" Delly turned around to regard Catti-brie. \"Nor does she. She\u0027s yer friend, and I\u0027m liking it that way.\" She pulled away from Wulfgar but stood back and stared at him, a sincere smile wide on her pretty face. \"To be sure, there\u0027s a part o\u0027 me fearing that ye\u0027ll want her for more than friendship. I can\u0027t be helping that, but I\u0027m not to be giving in to it. I trust ye and trust in what me and ye have started here, but don\u0027t ye be putting Catti-brie away from yerself in trying to protect me, because that\u0027s not where she belongs. Most folks\u0027d be glad to have a friend like her.\" \"And I am,\" Wulfgar admitted. He looked curiously at Delly. \"Why are you saying this now?\" Delly couldn\u0027t suppress her telling grin. \"Bruenor\u0027s talking about coming back out here. He\u0027s hoping that ye\u0027ll be joining him.\" \"My place is with you and Colson.\" Delly was shaking her head even as he started that predictable response. \"Yer place is with me and our girl when yer life permits. Yer place is on the road with Bruenor and Drizzt and Catti-brie and Regis. I\u0027m knowing that, and it makes me love ye all the more!\" \u0027Their road is a dangerous one,\" Wulfgar reminded. \"Then more the reason for ye to help them along it.\" \"They\u0027re dwarfs!\" Nikwillig exclaimed, his voice breaking with excitement and relief. Tred, who had not climbed the last part of the steep boulder tumble and so could not see the huge caravan rolling along the flat ground to the south, leaned back against a rock and put his head in his hands. His left leg was swollen and would not bend. He hadn\u0027t realized how badly it had been torn during their respite in the small village, and he knew that he would not be able to go on for much longer without some proper tending, maybe even some divine intervention, courtesy of a cleric. Of course, Tred hadn\u0027t complained at all and had fought with every ounce of his strength to keep up with Nikwillig in their flight. It had been a strong and valiant run, but both dwarves knew they were nearing the end of their endurance. They needed a break, and apparently, one had found them. \"We can catch them if we angle out to the southeast,\" Nikwillig explained. \"Ye up for one more run?\" \"We need to make the run, we make the run,\" Tred said. \"Ain\u0027t come this far to lay down and die.\" Nikwillig nodded and turned around, gingerly beginning the steep descent. He stopped, though, freezing in place, his eyes locked across the way. Tred noted that look and followed that gaze to see a huge panther, black as the night sky, crouched on a ledge not so far away-not far enough away! \"Don\u0027t ye move,\" Nikwillig whispered. Tred didn\u0027t even bother to answer, thinking exactly the same thing, though he understood that the great cat knew exactly where they were. He pondered what he might do if the cat sprang his way. How could he even begin to hurt that mass of muscle and claws? Well, he decided, if it comes on, it goes away bloody. The seconds slipped past, neither the cat nor the dwarves moving an inch. With a growl that seemed a challenge, Tred pushed out from the wall to stand straight and strong and put his heavy axe up at the ready beside him. The great panther looked his way but not threateningly. In fact, the cat seemed almost bored. \"Please don\u0027t throw that at her,\" came a voice from below and to the side, and the two dwarves glanced down to see a brown-haired halfling moving out onto an open, flat stone. \"When Guenhwyvar gets an invitation to play, it\u0027s hard to stop her.\" \"That yer cat?\" Tred asked. \"Not mine, no,\" the halfling answered. \"She a friend and mastered by a friend, if you get my meaning.\" Tred nodded. \"Well, who are ye then?\" \"I could be asking you the same question,\" the halfling answered. \"In fact, I believe that I will.\" \"And ye\u0027ll be getting yer answer after we\u0027re getting ours.\" The halfling bowed low. \"Regis of Mithral Hall,\" he said. \"Friend to King Bruenor Battlehammer, and scout for the caravan your friend sees below. Returning from Icewind Dale.\" Tred relaxed, and so did Nikwillig. \"The King o\u0027 Mithral Hall keeps strange company,\" Tred remarked. \"Stranger than you would ever believe,\" Regis was quick to answer. He glanced to the side, and so did both dwarves, to see a second dark figure, this one not feline, but a drow elf. Tred nearly fell over. Above him, Nikwillig did slip a bit, barely catching a hold before he tumbled from the climb. \"You still have not told me your name,\" Regis reminded, \"and I am guessing that you\u0027re not from around here if you\u0027ve not heard of Drizzt Do\u0027Urden and his panther Guenhwyvar.\" \"Wait, I heared o\u0027 him!\" Nikwillig said from above Tred, and Tred looked up. \"Bruenor\u0027s friend drow. Yeah, we heared o\u0027 that!\" \"And pray tell us where you were when you heard,\" Drizzt prompted. Nikwillig moved down fast, dropping beside Tred, and both dwarves set themselves more presentably, with Nikwillig brushing some of the road dust from his weathered tunic. \"Tred McKnuckles\u0027s me name,\" Tred announced, \"and this\u0027s me friend Nikwillig, outta Citadel Felbarr and the kingdom o* Emerus Warcrown.\" \"Long way from home,\" Drizzt observed. \"Longer than ye\u0027re thinking,\" Tred answered. \"Been a road o\u0027 orcs and giants, and one wrong trail leading to another wrong trail.\" \"A tale well worth hearing, I am sure,\" Drizzt replied, \"but not here and not now. Let us get you down to Bruenor and the others.\" \"Bruenor\u0027s in that caravan?\" Nikwillig asked. \"Returning from Icewind Dale to assume the throne of Mithral Hall, for word reached us that Gandalug Battlehammer is dead.\" \"Moradin put him to work at his anvil,\" said Tred, a customary blessing for dead dwarves. Drizzt nodded. \"Indeed. And may Moradin guide Bruenor well.\" \"And may Moradin, or whatever good god is listening, guide us well, back to the caravan,\" Regis reminded. When Drizzt and the others regarded the halfling, they saw that he was looking around nervously, as if he expected that Tred and Nikwillig had led a host of giants to the ridge, giants that were preparing to rain stones on the five of them. \"Keep scouting, Guenhwyvar,\" Drizzt instructed, and he started toward the dwarves. Both of the bearded fellows instinctively stiffened and the perceptive drow stopped his approach. \"Regis, you accompany them to Bruenor,\" Drizzt decided. \"I will keep the perimeter with Guenhwyvar.\" He saluted the dwarves and slipped away, and both Tred and Nikwillig visibly relaxed. \"We\u0027re safe with Drizzt and Guenhwyvar flanking us,\" Regis assured the dwarves as he approached. \"Safer than you can imagine.\" Tred and Nikwillig looked at each other, then back at the halfling, and nodded, though neither seemed overly confident in Regis\u0027s words. \"Don\u0027t worry,\" the halfling said, offering an understanding wink. \"You\u0027ll get used to him.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-thousand-orcs-hunter-s-blades-1/page-6.html","bookId":2140,"book":{"id":2140,"title":"The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1)","description":"Storyline: The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1) This mass market reprint focuses primarily on his signature character, Drizzt Doourden, who has been the subject of most of Salvatore\u0027s best-selling titles for Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
