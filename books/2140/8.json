{"id":95613,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Bruenor purposely excluded Thibbledorf Pwent from the meeting with the two dwarves of Citadel Felbarr, knowing the gist of their story beforehand from Regis, and knowing that the battlerager would likely charge right off into the mountains to avenge their fallen Felbarr kin. And so Nikwillig and Tred recounted their adventures to a group that was comprised more of non-dwarves-Drizzt, Catti-brie, Wulfgar, and Regis-than dwarves.\\n\\n \"A fine escape,\" Bruenor congratulated when the pair had finished. \"Ye done Emerus Warcrown proud.\"\\n\\n Both Tred and Nikwillig puffed up a bit at the compliment from the dwarf king.\\n\\n \"What\u0027re ye thinking?\" Bruenor asked, directing the question to Dagnabbit.\\n\\n The younger dwarf considered the question carefully for a long while, then answered, \"I\u0027ll take me a group o\u0027 warriors, including the Gutbuster Brigade, and backtrack the route to the Surbrin in the north. If we find the raiders, we\u0027ll crush \u0027em and come home. If not, we\u0027ll tack south along the river and meet up with ye in Mithral Hall.\"\\n\\n Bruenor nodded throughout the recitation of the plan, expecting every word. Dagnabbit was good, but he was also predictable.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d be likin\u0027 another shot at them killers,\" Tred interjected.\\n\\n His words made Nikwillig, who obviously didn\u0027t share the sentiment, look more than a little uncomfortable.\\n\\n \"Forgettin\u0027 yer hurt leg?\" Nikwillig remarked.\\n\\n \"Bah, Bruenor\u0027s priests done me good with their warm hands,\" Tred insisted, and to accentuate the point the dwarf stood up and began hopping around, and indeed, despite a wince or two, he seemed ready for the road.\\n\\n Bruenor studied the pair for a moment.\\n\\n \"Well, we can\u0027t let ye both get killed, or yer tale\u0027ll not be told proper to Emerus Warcrown. So, ye can come on the hunt, Tred, and yerself, Nikwillig, will go back to Mithral Hall with the others.\"\\n\\n \"King Bruenor, yer words make ye sound like ye\u0027re headin\u0027 out on the hunt yerself,\" Dagnabbit remarked, drawing a hard stare from Bruenor.\\n\\n Bruenor knew the expectations of those around him, particularly of Dagnabbit, who was sworn to secure his king\u0027s safety. He knew that the proper course for him, as King of Mithral Hall, would be to head south straightaway with the bulk of his force, back to the security of his kingdom, back where he could direct further counterstrikes in search of this marauding band of orcs and giants. That was what was expected of him, but the mere thought of it made Bruenor\u0027s gut churn.\\n\\n He looked over at Drizzt with a pleading look, and the dark elf offered a slight, knowing nod in response.\\n\\n \"What\u0027re ye thinking, elf?\" Bruenor asked.\\n\\n \"T would have an easier time finding the monsters than Pwent and his wild band,\" Drizzt replied. \"An easier time even than good Dagnabbit here, though I doubt not his prowess at hunting orcs.\"\\n\\n \"Then ye come with me,\" Dagnabbit offered.\\n\\n There was a slight crack in his voice, showing that he saw where this might be heading, and showing that he was not too pleased by the prospect.\\n\\n \"T will go,\" Drizzt agreed, \"but with my friends around me. Those whom I have come to trust the most. Those who best recognize how to compliment my every move.\"\\n\\n He nodded in turn to Catti-brie, to Wulfgar, and to Regis, then paused for a moment and turned directly to Bruenor-and nodded. A smile widened on the face of the dwarf king.\\n\\n \"No, no, no,\" Dagnabbit remarked immediately. \"Ye cannot be taking me king into the wilds.\"\\n\\n \"I believe the choice is Bruenor\u0027s to make, my friend, not yours, and not mine,\" Drizzt replied. He returned Bruenor\u0027s grateful smile and asked the king, \"One last hunt?\"\\n\\n \"Who says it\u0027s the last?\" came Bruenor\u0027s gruff reply.\\n\\n The friends chuckled, then laughed all the harder when Dagnabbit stomped his heavy boot on the ground and exclaimed, \"Dagnabbit!\"\\n\\n \"Bah, but yerself can come along, ye dumb dwarf,\" Bruenor said to his young commander. \"And yerself,\" he added, looking over at Tred, who nodded grimly.\\n\\n \"And ye bring some fighters with ye!\" Dagnabbit insisted.\\n\\n \"Pwent and his boys,\" said Bruenor.\\n\\n \"No!\" Dagnabbit shouted emphatically.\\n\\n \"But you just said . . .\"\\n\\n \"That was afore I thinked yerself was goin\u0027.\"\\n\\n Bruenor patted his hands in the air to calm the excited dwarf.\\n\\n \"Not Pwent, then,\" he said, understanding his young commander\u0027s concern. Pwent could start a fight with a rock, so it was said in Mithral Hall, and hurt himself and everyone around him badly before he won the scuffle. \"Ye pick the group yerself. Twenty o\u0027 yer best-\"\\n\\n \"Twenty-five,\" Dagnabbit argued.\\n\\n \"Well, get \u0027em ready soon,\" Bruenor said to Dagnabbit, and to all of them. \"I\u0027m wanting to be on the road this same day. We got orcs and giants to squish!\"\\n\\n The dwarf looked around at all his friends and noted that Wulfgar\u0027s grin was not as wide as those of Drizzt, Catti-brie, and even Regis. Bruenor nodded his understanding to his adopted son, his implied permission for Wulfgar, now a father and a husband, to opt out of the hunt if he saw fit to do so.\\n\\n Wulfgar tightened his jaw in response, returned the nod, and strode away.\\n\\n \"Ye can\u0027t be thinkin\u0027 what I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 ye\u0027re thinkin\u0027!\" said Shingles McRuff.\\n\\n He was one of the toughest looking critters in all of Mirabar, a short and exceedingly stout dwarf whose nasty attitude was always clearly shown on his ruddy, weathered face. He was missing an eye, and simply never bothered to fill in the empty socket, just covered it with an eye patch. Half of his black beard was torn away, the right side of his face showing as one big scar.\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 what I\u0027m thinkin\u0027,\" Torgar Hammerstriker replied, \"and I\u0027m not knowin\u0027 what ye\u0027re thinkin\u0027 I\u0027m thinkin\u0027!\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 that ye\u0027re thinkin\u0027 o\u0027 leavin\u0027,\" Shingles slated bluntly, and that got the attention of all the other dwarves in the crowded tavern in the highest subterranean level of the city. \"Don\u0027t know what the marchion said to ye, bud, but I\u0027m betting it ain\u0027t nothing next to what yer grandpa\u0027d be sayin\u0027 to ye if yer grandpa was still here to be sayin\u0027 things to ye.\"\\n\\n Torgar threw up his hands and waved away the words, and the looks of all the others.\\n\\n At least he tried to, for several other dwarves moved in close, pulling up chairs, and more than one started the same question: \"Ye heading out o\u0027 Mirabar, Torgar?\"\\n\\n Torgar ran his hands through his thick hair.\\n\\n \"Course I ain\u0027t, ye durned fools!\" he said, rather unconvincingly. \"Me father\u0027s father\u0027s father\u0027s father\u0027s father spent his days here.\"\\n\\n Despite his bluster, even Torgar could recognize the hint of doubt in his own statements, and that made him ask himself if he really was thinking of leaving Mirabar. He was as mad as a demon at Elastul, to be sure, but was there really a notion, deep in his head and deep in his heart, that it might be time for him to end the Hammerstriker dynasty in Mirabar?\\n\\n He ran his hands through his thick hair again, and again, and ended up shouting, \"Bah!\" in the faces of those around him.\\n\\n He stood up so forcefully that his chair skidded out behind him, and he stomped away, grabbing a flagon of ale from the bar as he passed and tossing back a coin to the obviously amused tavern keeper.\\n\\n Out in the cavern that housed the cluster of buildings in the First Below -the highest section of Mirabar\u0027s Undercity-Torgar looked all around him, noting the structures and noting the striations of the stone that housed them, stone so familiar to him that he felt as if it was a part of him, and of his heritage.\\n\\n \"Stupid Elastul,\" he muttered under his breath. \"Stupid all o\u0027 ye, not seem\u0027 King Bruenor and his boys for the friends they be.\"\\n\\n He walked away, unaware that his last statements had been overheard by several others, including Shingles, all huddled near the open window of the tavern.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s meanin\u0027 it,\" another dwarf remarked.\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 that he\u0027s gonna go,\" said another.\\n\\n \"Bah, whaddya know aside from which drink ye\u0027re drinkin\u0027?\" Shingles blustered at them. \"If ye\u0027re even knowin\u0027 which drink ye\u0027re drinkin\u0027!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m knowing!\" shouted another dwarf, from across the way. \"So I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 that I\u0027m not drinkin\u0027 enough o\u0027 what I\u0027m drinkin\u0027!\"\\n\\n That brought a roar, and cries of rounds from several parts of the tavern.\\n\\n Shingles McRuff just grinned at them all, though, and kept looking out the window, though Torgar, his old buddy and comrade at arms, was long out of sight.\\n\\n Despite his disclaimer and Torgar\u0027s denial. Shingles could not disagree with the consensus that Torgar was indeed serious about leaving Mirabar. The arrival of King Bruenor and the boys from Mithral Hall had put a face on a previously faceless enemy, a face that Torgar and many others had come to see as a friend. A rival, perhaps, but certainly no enemy. The treatment Elastul and the other leaders, mostly human, had shown to Bruenor and to the Mirabarran dwarves who had gone to hear Bruenor\u0027s tales or buy the wares from Icewind Dale had not set well with Torgar or with many others.\\n\\n For the first time since the incident, Shingles McRuff seriously considered the recent events and the wider implications of them.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t much like where his thoughts were suddenly, and already, leading him.\\n\\n \"Guilt\u0027s a funny thing, now ain\u0027t it?\" Delly Curtie playfully asked Wulfgar when he returned to her and Colson at their wagon.\\n\\n \"Guilt?\" came the skeptical response. \"Or an understanding of my responsibilities?\"\\n\\n \"Guilt,\" Delly answered without the slightest hesitation.\\n\\n \"In taking on a family, I accepted the responsibility of protecting that family.\"\\n\\n \"And what do ye think will happen to me and Colson surrounded by two hundred friendly dwarves? Ye\u0027re not abandoning us out in the wilds, Wulfgar. We\u0027re going to safety. \u0027Tis yerself that\u0027s walking to danger!\"\\n\\n \"And even in that, I am abandoning my respons-\"\\n\\n \"Oh, don\u0027t ye start that again!\" Delly interrupted, and loudly, drawing the attention of several nearby dwarves. \"Ye do as ye must. Ye live the life ye were meant to live.\"\\n\\n \"You came all the way out here with me ...\"\\n\\n \"Livin\u0027 the life I\u0027m choosin\u0027 to live,\" Delly explained. \"I\u0027m not wanting to lose ye-not for a moment-but T know that if ye abandon yer heart to stand with me and Colson all the day, then I\u0027ve already lost ye. Come to Mithral Hall if that\u0027s what\u0027s truly in yer heart, me love, but if not, then get yerself out on the road with Bruenor and th\u0027 others.\"\\n\\n \"And what if I die out there, away from you?\"\\n\\n It was not a question asked out of fear, for Wulfgar was not afraid of dying out on the road. He was an adventurer, a warrior, and as long as he could hold faith that he was following the true course of his life, then whatever was put before him would be acceptable.\\n\\n Of course, he wouldn\u0027t die on the road without a fight!\\n\\n \"I think about it all the time,\" Delly admitted, \"because I\u0027m knowin\u0027 that ye\u0027ve got to be going. And if ye die on the road, then know that yer Colson will be proud o\u0027 her daddy. For a bit, I thinked about changing yer heart, about tricking ye into staying by me side, but that\u0027s not who ye are. I see it on yer face-a face that\u0027s smiling all the wider when the wild wind is blowin\u0027 across it. Me and Colson can accept whatever fate ye find at the end o\u0027 yer road, Wulfgar son of Beornegar, so long as ye\u0027re walking the road of yer heart.\"\\n\\n She moved up close as she spoke, kneeling in front of the sitting Wulfgar and draping her arms over his shoulders.\\n\\n \"Just give an orc a good smack for me, will ya?\u0027\"\\n\\n Wulfgar was smiling then as he looked into her sparkling eyes- sparkling more than they ever had back in the days when Delly had worked in Arumn\u0027s tavern in the seedy bowels of Luskan. Something about the road, the fresh air, the adventure, the child, had gotten into the woman, and Delly seemed to grow more beautiful, more wholesome, more healthy with every passing day.\\n\\n Wulfgar pulled her close and hugged her tightly. His thoughts went back to the day when Robillard had dropped him in the center of Luskan, presenting him with two choices: the road south and security beside Delly and Colson, or the road north, to join his friends in adventure. Hearing Delly\u0027s words, the sincerity in her voice, the love and admiration accompanying it, Wulfgar was never more glad of his choice, of that northward turn, and never more sure of himself.\\n\\n And never more in love with this woman who had become his wife.\\n\\n \"I will give him two good smacks for you,\" Wulfgar answered, and he moved in to kiss his wife.\\n\\n \"Nah,\" Delly said, pulling back teasingly. \"Yer first one\u0027ll send him flyin\u0027 far enough.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t move away again as Wulfgar\u0027s lips found hers, in a long and leading kiss, gentle at first but then pressing more urgently. The barbarian started to stand, easily lifting the lithe Delly up with him, guiding her to the privacy of their covered wagon.\\n\\n Colson woke up then and started to cry.\\n\\n Wulfgar and Delly could only laugh.\\n\\n Thibbledorf Pwent hopped around, uttering a series of sounds that amply reflected his frustration and disappointment, and kicking at every stone he passed, even those far too big to be kicked. Still, if the tough dwarf felt any pain, he didn\u0027t show it much, just an occasional grunt within the steady stream of curses, and an added hop here or there after a particularly vicious kick at a particularly stubborn rock.\\n\\n Finally, after circling King Bruenor for many minutes of random cursing, Pwent hopped to a stop, and put his stubby hands on his hips.\\n\\n \"Ye\u0027re going for a fight, and a fight\u0027s where me and me boys belong!\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to pay back a small band o\u0027 orcs and a couple o\u0027 giants,\" Bruenor corrected. \"Won\u0027t be much of a fight, and even less o\u0027 one if Pwent and his boys are there.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s what we do.\"\\n\\n \"And too well!\" Bruenor cried.\\n\\n Pwent\u0027s eyes widened.\\n\\n \"Huh?\"\\n\\n \"Ye durned fool!\" Bruenor scolded. \"Don\u0027t ye see that this\u0027ll be me last time? When we get back to Mithral Hall, I\u0027ll be the king again, and what a boring title that is!\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027re ye talkin\u0027 about? Ye\u0027re the best king . . .\"\\n\\n Bruenor silenced him with a wave and an exaggerated look of disgust.\\n\\n \"Talkin\u0027 with lying emissaries, making pretty with fancy fool lords and fancier and more foolish ladies ... Ye think I\u0027ll get to use me axe much in the next hunnerd years? Only if another army o\u0027 damned drow come a\u0027knocking at our doors! So now I get the chance, one last chance, and ye\u0027re thinking to steal all me fun with yer killer band. And I thinked ye was me friend.\"\\n\\n That set Pwent back on his heels, putting the whole situation in a light he had never begun to imagine.\\n\\n \"I am yer friend, King Bruenor,\" Pwent said somberly, as reserved as Bruenor or anyone else had ever seen him. \"FU be takin\u0027 me boys back to Mithral Hall to get the place ready for yer arrival.\"\\n\\n He paused and offered Bruenor a sly wink -well, it was intended to be sly, at least, but from Pwent it just came out as an exaggerated twitch.\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m hopin\u0027 ye won\u0027t be back anytime soon,\" Pwent went on, with more comprehension than Bruenor had expected. \"Might be just one small band that hit the boys from Felbarr, but might be that ye\u0027ll find a bunch o\u0027 other small bands betwixt here and that one, and a bunch more on yer way back home. Good fighting, King Bruenor. May ye notch yer axe a thousand more times afore ye see yer shining halls once more!\"\\n\\n With great cheering and fanfare, promises of death to the orcs and giants, and eternal friendship between Mithral Hall and Citadel Felbarr, the band of Bruenor and his dear friends, along with Dagnabbit, Tred, and twenty-five stout warriors, moved off from the main group, turning north into the mountains. Dwarves were not a bloodthirsty race, but they knew how to celebrate when the occasion was a war against goblinkind and giantkin, their most hated of foes.\\n\\n As for the friends, as one (even Regis!) they felt energized and refreshed to be on the road to adventure once again, and so the only regrets that fine morning were felt by those who had not been chosen to go.\\n\\n For the dark elf, it was old times and new times all rolled together, the same camaraderie that had so enriched his life of recent years, his old band\\n\\n marching together into adventure in rugged lands, and yet, with a better understanding of each other and of their respective places in the world. The day was full of promise indeed!\\n\\n What Drizzt Do\u0027Urden did not understand was that he was walking headlong into the saddest day of his life.\\n\\n I am not afraid to die. There, I said it, I admitted it... to myself. I am not afraid to die, nor have I been since the day I walked out of Menzoberranzan. Only now have I come to fully appreciate that fact, and only because of a very special friend named Bruenor Battlehammer.\\n\\n It is not bravado that makes such words flow from my lips. Not some needed show of courage and not some elevation of myself above any others. It is the simple truth. I am not afraid to die.\\n\\n I do not wish to die, and I hold faith that I will fight viciously against any attempts to kill me. I\u0027ll not run foolishly into an enemy encampment with no chance of victory (though my friends often accuse me of just that, and even the obvious fact that we are not yet dead does not dissuade them from their barbs). Nay, I hope to live for several centuries. I hope to live forever, with my dear friends all about me every step of that unending journey.\\n\\n So, why the lack of fear? I understand well enough that the road I willingly walk-indeed, the road I choose to walk-is fraught with peril and presents the very real possibility that one day, perhaps soon, I, or my friends, will be slain. And while it would kill me to be killed, obviously, and kill me even more to see great harm come to any of my dear friends, I will not shy from this road. Nor will they.\\n\\n And now I know why. And now, because of Bruenor, I understand why I am not afraid to die.\\n\\n Before, I expected that my lack of fear was due to some faith in a higher being, a deity, an afterlife, and there remains that comforting hope. That is but a part of the equation, though, and a part that is based upon prayers and blind faith, rather than the certain knowledge of that which truly sustains me, which truly guides me, which truly allows me to take every step along the perilous road with a profound sense of inner calm.\\n\\n I am not afraid to die because I know that I am part of a something, a concept, a belief, that is bigger than all that is me, body and soul\\n\\n When I asked Bruenor about this road away from Mithral Hall that he has chosen, I put the question simply: what will the folk of Mithral Hall do if you are killed on the road?\\n\\n His answer was even more simple and obvious: they\u0027ll do better then than if I went home and hid!\\n\\n That s the way of the dwarves-and it is an expectation they place upon all of their leaders. Even the overprotective ones, such as the consummate bodyguard Pwent, understand deep down that if they truly shelter Bruenor, they have, in effect, already slain the King of Mithral Hall. Bruenor recognizes that the concept of Mithral Hall, a theocracy that is, in fact, a subtle democracy, is bigger than the dwarf, whoever it might be, who is presently occupying the throne. And Bruenor recognizes that kings before him and kings after him will die in battle, tragically, with the dwarves they leave behind caught unprepared for his demise. But countering that seeming inevitability, in the end, is that the concept that is Mithral Hall will rise from the ashes of the funeral pyre. When the drow came to Mithral Hall, as when any enemy in the past ever threatened the place, Bruenor, as king, stood strong and forthright, leading the charge. Indeed, it was Bruenor Battlehammer, and not some warrior acting on his behalf, who slew Matron Baenre herself, the finest notch he ever put into that nasty axe of his.\\n\\n That is the place of a dwarf king, because a dwarf king must understand that the kingdom is more important than the king, that the clan is bigger than the king, that the principles of the clan\u0027s existence are the correct principles and are bigger than the mortal coil of king and commoner alike.\\n\\n If Bruenor didn\u0027t believe that, if he couldn\u0027t honestly look his enemies coldly in the eye without fear for his own safety, then Bruenor should not be King of Mithral Hall. A leader who hides when danger reveals itself is no leader at all. A leader who thinks himself irreplaceable and invaluable is a fool.\\n\\n But I am no leader, so how does this apply to me and my chosen road? Because I know in my heart that I walk a road of truth, a road of the best intentions (if sometimes those intentions are misguided), a road that to me is an honest one. I believe that my way is the correct way (for me, at least), and in my heart, if I ever do not believe this, then I must work hard to alter my course.\\n\\n Many trials present themselves along this road. Enemies and other physical obstacles abound, of course, but along with them come the pains of the heart. In despair, I traveled back to Menzoberranzan, to surrender to the drow so that they would leave my friends alone, and in that most basic of errors I nearly cost the woman who is most dear to me her very life. I watched a confused and tired Wulfgar walk away from our group and feared he was walking into danger from which he would never emerge. And yet, despite the agony of that parting, I knew that I had to let him go.\\n\\n At times it is hard to hold confidence that the chosen fork in the road is the right one. The image of Ellifain dying will haunt me forever, I fear, yet I hold in retrospect the understanding that there was nothing I could have truly done differently. Even now knowing the dire consequences of my actions on that fateful day half a century ago, I believe that I would follow the same course, the one that my heart and my conscience forced upon me. For that is all that I can do, all that anyone can do. The inner guidance of conscience is the best marker along this difficult road, even if it is not foolproof.\\n\\n I will follow it, though I know so well now the deep wounds I might find.\\n\\n For as long as I believe that I am walking the true road, if I am slain, then I die in the knowledge that for a brief period at least, I was part of something bigger than Drizzt Do\u0027Urden.\\n\\n I was part of the way it should be.\\n\\n No drow, no man, no dwarf, could ever ask for more than that.\\n\\n I am not afraid to die. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-thousand-orcs-hunter-s-blades-1/page-8.html","bookId":2140,"book":{"id":2140,"title":"The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1)","description":"Storyline: The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1) \\n This mass market reprint focuses primarily on his signature character, Drizzt Doourden, who has been the subject of most of Salvatore\u0027s best-selling titles for Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
