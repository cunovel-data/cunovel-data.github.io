{"id":95614,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\"We\u0027re lost!\" the yellow-bearded dwarf roared.\\n\\n He took a threatening step forward, nearly tripping over his long, wagging beard. He was a square-shouldered creature, with hardly a neck to speak of, and a face full of exaggerated features: a huge nose, long and wide; a great mouth of large teeth showing under the pronounced yellow whiskers; and wild dark eyes set in wide sockets, seeming all the wilder as he wound up into one of his more animated moods. Though his heavy plate mail was lying by the bedrolls, he still wore his great helm, fashioned of metal and the towering antlers of a ten-point deer.\\n\\n \"How can we be lost, ye danged fool?\" he said. \"Ye got all them birds leadin\u0027 ye, don\u0027t ye?\"\\n\\n The other dwarf, his older brother, shrugged and gave a plaintive, \"Oooo\" sound.\\n\\n He looked down at his feet, clad in sandals and not the typical heavy dwarven boots, and kicked a nearby rock, sending it bouncing into the brush.\\n\\n \"Ye said ye could get me there!\" Ivan Bouldershoulder roared on. \"A shortcut? Yeah, a danged shortcut that\u0027s got us somewhere. Near to Mithral Hall? No! But somewhere, and ye\u0027re right, ye stupid doo-dad, ye got us here fast!\"\\n\\n The blustering dwarf stood up straight and adjusted his battered chain mail jerkin, fixing the bandoleer of tiny crossbow bolts that crossed from his left shoulder to his right hip.\\n\\n \"Tick, tick, lick, boom,\" his brother warned for the hundredth time, waggling a finger at those special crossbow bolts, each fitted with a small vial of oil of impact.\\n\\n In response, the angry Ivan drew out a handheld crossbow, an exact replica of the kind favored by the dark elves of the Underdark, and waggled it back at Pikel.\\n\\n \"Boom, yerself, ye stupid doo-dad!\"\\n\\n Pikel\u0027s eyes rolled up into his head and he whispered a quick chant. Before Ivan could tell him to knock it off, a small branch snapped down at the yellow-bearded dwarf\u0027s extended arm, enwrapping the wrist and tugging back up to put Ivan on the tips of his toes.\\n\\n \"Ye don\u0027t want to play like this,\" Ivan warned. \"Not now.\"\\n\\n \"No boom,\" Pikel said firmly, waggling his finger like a scolding mother.\\n\\n He seemed perfectly ridiculous, of course, as he usually did, with his long, green-dyed beard parted in the middle and pulled up over his large ears, then braided together with his long hair to run halfway down his back. He wore light green robes, layered and tied with a thick rope at his waist, and with voluminous sleeves that hung down over his hands if he held his arms at his side.\\n\\n Ivan gave a little laugh, one that promised his older brother that he\u0027d be meeting a fist very soon.\\n\\n Pikel just ignored him and walked to the side of their small encampment, where a bowl of vegetable stew was boiling over the fire. The pair had been out of the Spirit Soaring cathedral in the mountains above the small town of Carradoon for more than a tenday, accepting Cadderly\u0027s invitation to them to represent him and his wife Danica and al I the cathedral in the formal coronation of King Bruenor Battlehammer of Mithral Hall. Ivan and Pikel had been muttering about going to see Mithral Hall for years, ever since Drizzt Do\u0027Urden and Catti-brie had come through the Spirit Soaring on the road to find a lost friend. With things settled comfortably along the Snowflake Mountains, and with the great event of Bruenor\u0027s forthcoming coronation, the time seemed perfect.\\n\\n Just out of the Snowflake Mountains, their road barely begun, Pikel, who was a druid in his heart and in practice, had informed his brother that he could guide them more swiftly on their long journey. He could talk to animals after all, though he hardly seemed able to talk to anyone else except for Ivan, who understood his every grunt. He could predict the weather with a high degree of accuracy, and there was one more little trick up Pikel\u0027s wide sleeve, a mode of teleportation that druids understood, using the connectedness of trees to step into one and emerge through another, many miles away.\\n\\n Ivan and Pikel had done just that, once thus far, and with more than a little complaining from Ivan, who thought the whole trip perfectly unnatural. They had come out into a deep, dark forest. At first, Ivan had figured that they had entered Shilmista, the elf woodland across the Snowflakes from Carradoon, but after a day of wandering in the dark place, both he and Pikel had come to realize that the tone of this particular forest was very different from the magical land ruled by Elbereth and his dancing kin. This forest, wherever it was and whatever it was, was darker and more foreboding than that airy forest of Shilmista. The wind held a deeper bite, as if they had gone further north.\\n\\n \"Ye gonna let me down?\" Ivan called from his perch beneath the entrapping tree.\\n\\n \"Uh-uh.\"\\n\\n Ivan gave a little chuckle, held his free hand out under the trapped arm and dropped the handheld crossbow to his own waiting grasp. He moved fast, bringing the weapon up to his face, hooking the bowstring under his top teeth and pushing it straight up until it clicked in the readied position, then he bit the weapon\u0027s handgrip, holding it in his mouth, while he reached down to pull a small dart from his bandoleer.\\n\\n \"Oooof\" Pikel howled when he noticed. He lifted a small log from beside the fire and uttered a quick chant, proclaiming it a \"Sha-la-la,\" and charged for his brother.\\n\\n Ivan calmly and deliberately set the quarrel in place on the crossbow, then took up the weapon, pointing it at the entangling branch. Realizing that the howling Pikel was too close, though, the yellow-bearded dwarf matter-of-factly lowered the weapon the charging Pikel\u0027s way and fired.\\n\\n The quarrel hit Pikel\u0027s raised enchanted club squarely, the quarrel sticking home, then collapsing on itself. A blinding, concussive flash halted Pikel\u0027s charge, and left the stunned dwarf standing there, his beard and hair smoking on the right side, his right arm still upraised, but holding only a blackened stump instead of an enchanted cudgel.\\n\\n \"Oooo,\" the druid dwarf moaned.\\n\\n \"Yeah, and yer tree is next!\" Ivan promised, and he put the crossbow back in his mouth, his hand going for another dart.\\n\\n Pikel hit him with a flying tackle that became more of a flying tackle when the hugging dwarves flew backward, only to be pulled forward by the strong branch, and of course, to rebound backward again.\\n\\n And so they went, bouncing back and forth, Pikel grabbing at the crossbow and at Ivan\u0027s pumping arm, and Ivan punching Pikel, though they were too tightly embraced for him to do any real damage. All the while, the stubborn branch held strong, and the two struggling dwarves only seemed to gain momentum on their back and forth and all-around ride.\\n\\n They were nearing the highest point of one such bounce when Pikel\u0027s enchantment let go, sending a ball of Bouldershoulder soaring into the air, to land with a communal \"oof\"\u0027 and go rolling away.\\n\\n They rolled past the fire, very close, and Ivan yelped when he burned the tip of his nose. They crashed through the lean-to Pikel had constructed, sending twigs flying. At one point, Pikel managed to wriggle away enough to begin casting another enchantment, so Ivan slapped his strong hand over his brother\u0027s mouth. Pikel promptly bit him.\\n\\n It would have gone on for many minutes-it usually did when the Bouldershoulder brothers were involved, but a low growl from the fire pit stopped both dwarves dead in their roll, each with a fist heading in strong for the other\u0027s face. As one, the prone brothers turned their heads, to see a large black bear pawing at the hot vegetable stew.\\n\\n Ivan shoved Pikel away and leaped to his feet.\\n\\n \"Praise Moradin!\" he yelled as he looked around for his mighty axe. \"Got me a new cloak!\"\\n\\n Pikel\u0027s shriek rent the night air and silenced every night bird for a hundred yards around.\\n\\n \"Shut yer trap!\" Ivan ordered.\\n\\n He rushed out to the side, spying his weapon, and heard his brother chanting again as he started past. Ivan expected to get his with another relatively harmless but ultimately annoying trick of nature.\\n\\n When the excited Ivan had his axe in hand, he turned back to the fire ... to see Pikel sitting in front of the contented bear, resting comfortably against its thick fur.\\n\\n \"Ye didn\u0027t,\" Ivan moaned.\\n\\n \"Hee hee hee.\"\\n\\n With a growl, Ivan lifted his arm and sent his axe twirling down to stick into the sod.\\n\\n \"Damned Cadderly,\" he bitched, for in Ivan\u0027s eyes, Cadderly had created a monster in Pikel.\\n\\n It was Cadderly who had first made a pet of a wild animal, a white squirrel he had named Percival, of all things. Taking that cue, Pikel had become rather famous for the friends he had made (infamous to Ivan, who thought the whole thing quite embarrassing) at the Spirit Soaring cathedral, particularly among Cadderly and Danica\u0027s children. To date, those friends included a great eagle, a pair of bald-headed vultures, a weasel family, three chickens, and a stubborn donkey named Bobo.\\n\\n And now a bear.\\n\\n Ivan sighed.\\n\\n The bear gave a soft moan and seemed to fall over, settling comfortably on the ground, where it started snoring almost immediately. So did Pikel.\\n\\n Ivan sighed more deeply.\\n\\n \"I do not demand applause, no,\" the gnome Nanfoodle explained, his little arms crossed over his thin chest, one large foot tapping anxiously on the floor, \"but it would be appreciated, yes!\"\\n\\n Standing at no more than three and a half feet, with a long, pointy, crooked nose, his head bald but for a semicircular mane of wild white hair that stuck straight out above his ears and all the way back around, Nanfoodle was not an imposing figure. He was, however, one of the most celebrated alchemists in the North, a fact that Elastul and Shoudra Stargleam knew well.\\n\\n The Marchion of Mirabar began clapping, his smile wide and sincere, for Nanfoodle has just brought him a piece of specially treated metal, smelted and fashioned of ore taken from the mines just a tenday before.\\n\\n Coated with the new formula the ingenious gnome had concocted, this plate was stronger than the others made of the same batch.\\n\\n To the side, the Sceptrana was too busy continuing her inspection of the various pieces to join in the applause, but she did offer an appreciative nod to the gnome, which Nanfoodle gladly accepted. The two were great friends and had been since before Elastul had hired Nanfoodle and brought him to Mirabar, mostly on the recommendation of Shoudra.\\n\\n \"And with your new treatment for the metals, our pieces will prove the best in the North,\" Elastul said.\\n\\n \"Well...\" The gnome hesitated. \"They will be better than they were, but. . .\"\\n\\n \"But? There can be no \u0027buts,\u0027 my dear Nanfoodle. Sceptrana Shoudra has contracts to secure, and it will take the finest-not merely better, but the finest! -to reclaim much of the commerce lost in recent years.\"\\n\\n \"The ore from our rivals is richer, and their techniques impeccable,\" Nanfoodle explained. \"My treatment will increase the strength and durability of our products by a fair amount, but I doubt that we\u0027ll outshine the ore of Mithral Hall.\"\\n\\n Elastul seemed to collapse in his seat, his hands clenched at his side.\\n\\n \"But we have improved!\" Nanfoodle said with great enthusiasm, hoping the emotion would prove infectious.\\n\\n It didn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"I do believe that this is the first time any measurable improvement through alchemical treatments has ever been honestly noted,\" Shoudra Stargleam added, and she quietly tossed a wink Nanfoodle\u0027s way. \"Despite the outlandish claims of many alchemists, there have been few -nay, not few, but no, improvements that are not magical in nature.\\n\\n \"And any improvement will help,\" Shoudra went on. \"There arc many previous clients who are on the borderline of decisions between Mirabar and Mithral Hall, and if we can improve our quality without raising our prices, then I believe I may sway more than a few our way.\"\\n\\n Elastul did begin to brighten at that, even started to nod, but Nanfoodle chimed in, \"Well. ..\"\\n\\n \"Well?\" the marchion asked suspiciously.\\n\\n \"The adamantine flakes needed in the treating solution do not come cheap,\" the gnome admitted.\\n\\n Elastul dropped his head into his hands. Behind him, the four Hammers muttered a few select curses.\\n\\n \"You are using adamantine?\" Shoudra asked. \"I thought you were experimenting with lead.\"\\n\\n \"I was,\" the gnome answered. \"And all of the blending formula was developed with lead as the additive base.\" He gave a shrug. \"But that only weakened the end product, unfortunately.\"\\n\\n \"Wait,\" Elastul bade him with biting and obvious sarcasm. The marchion came up straight in his chair, his finger pointing as if he had suddenly caught on to the big picture. \"You have found a way to blend the metals? And in doing so, if you use a stronger metal, you get a better product, but if you use a cheaper one, well, then you get a weaker product?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Marchion,\" Nanfoodle admitted, lowering his huge head against the biting sarcasm.\\n\\n \"Ever heard of alloys, dear Nanfoodle?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Marchion.\"\\n\\n \"Because I think you just re-invented them all over again.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Marchion.\"\\n\\n \"How much am I paying you?\"\\n\\n \"Enough,\" Shoudra Stargleam cut in, moving near to the marchion and dropping her hand on his forearm to calm him. \"This may be the first step to a great benefit. If Nanfoodle\u0027s technique eases the expensive process, then it is not without benefit. In any case, this seems the first step on a potentially profitable road. A good start, I would say!\"\\n\\n Her exuberance did make the gnome stand a bit straighter, but Marchion Elastul merely offered a sarcastic smirk in response.\\n\\n \"Well, by all means, good Nanfoodle,\" he said. \"Do not waste my time and coin in easing me along the whole of the process. Back to work, for you, and not to return until we are much farther along.\"\\n\\n The gnome gave a curt bow and scampered out of the room. When he was gone, Marchion Elastul gave a great, frustrated roar.\\n\\n \"Alchemy is the science of boast,\" Shoudra said.\\n\\n It was advice she had offered many times in the past. Elastul was spending huge sums on his team of alchemists and in truth, this was the greatest advance they had heard of thus far.\\n\\n \"This will not do,\" he said somberly, as if his anger had been thrown out in that previous roar. \"King Bruenor walks into our city and sets it all into confusion. They are beating us with their ore and with their demeanor.\\n\\n This will not do.\"\\n\\n \"Our markets remain strong for all the items that do not need the fine and expensive Mithral Hall ore,\" Shoudra reminded. \"Those items, the hoes and plows, the hinges and wheel strips, outnumber the swords and breastplates by far. Mithral Hall has cut down one portion of our business alone.\"\\n\\n \"The one portion that defines a mining city.\"\\n\\n \"True enough,\" Shoudra had to agree, but she merely shrugged.\\n\\n She had never been overly excited about the return of the neighboring dwarven stronghold and had always figured that Clan Battlehammer were better neighbors than the previous inhabitants of the place, the evil grey dwarves.\\n\\n \"Their momentum mounts,\" Elastul said, and he seemed to be talking more to himself than to Shoudra. \"King Bruenor, the legend, returns to them now.\"\\n\\n \"King Gandalug Battlehammer was fairly well known himself,\" Shoudra sarcastically replied. \"Returning from the ages lost, and all.\"\\n\\n Elastul shook his head with every word. \"Not like Bruenor, who wrested back control of the hall in our time. With his strange friends and hearty clan, Bruenor reshaped the northland, and his return is significant, I fear. With Bruenor back on the throne, you will find an even harder time in securing the contracts we need to prosper.\"\\n\\n \"Not so.\"\\n\\n \"It is not a chance I wish to take,\" Elastul snapped. \"Witness what his reputation alone did to shake our own city. A simple pass through, and half the dwarves are muttering his praises. No, this cannot stand.\"\\n\\n He sat back and put a finger to his pursed lips. Behind them, a smile gradually widened, as if some devious plan was formulating.\\n\\n Shoudra looked at him curiously and said, \"You cannot be thinking . .\\n\\n \"There are ways to see that Mithral Hall\u0027s reputation drops a few notches.\"\\n\\n \"Ways?\" an incredulous Shoudra asked.\\n\\n \"We have dwarves here who have befriended King Bruenor, yes? We have dwarves among us who now cal I the King of Mithral Hall their friend, and he returns the compliment.\"\\n\\n \"Torgar will commit no sabotage against Mithral Hall,\" Shoudra reasoned, seeing easily enough where this was leading.\\n\\n \"He will if he doesn\u0027t know he\u0027s doing it,\" Elastul said mysteriously, and for the first time since Nanfoodle had arrived with the initial, misguided news, the marchion\u0027s smile was wide and genuine.\\n\\n Shoudra Stargleam just looked at the man doubtfully. She had often heard his devious plotting, for he spent a great portion of his time on his throne doing just that. Almost always, though, it was just his wishful thinking at work. Despite his bluster, and even more than that, the bluster of the four Hammers who always stood behind him, Elastul wasn\u0027t really a man of action. He wanted to protect what he had and even try to improve it in a safe and secure manner, such as hiring alchemists, but to go an extra step, to actually attempt sabotage against Mithral Hall, for example, and thus risk starting a war, simply was not the man\u0027s style.\\n\\n It was entertaining to watch, though, Shoudra had to admit. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-thousand-orcs-hunter-s-blades-1/page-9.html","bookId":2140,"book":{"id":2140,"title":"The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1)","description":"Storyline: The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1) \\n This mass market reprint focuses primarily on his signature character, Drizzt Doourden, who has been the subject of most of Salvatore\u0027s best-selling titles for Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
