{"id":95619,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"A slight shift of Torgar\u0027s head sent the heavy fist sailing past, and the dwarf wasted no time in turning around and biting the attacker hard on the forearm. His opponent, another dwarf, waved that bitten arm frantically while punching hard with the other, but tough Torgar accepted the beating and bit down harder, driving in close to lessen the impact of the blows.\\n\\n Pushing, twisting, and driving on with his powerful legs, Torgar took his opponent right over a table and chair. The two of them crashed down hard, wood splintering around them.\\n\\n They weren\u0027t the only dwarves in the tavern who were fighting. Fists and bottles flew wildly, foreheads pounded against foreheads, and more than one table or chair went up in the air, to come crashing down on an opponent\u0027s head.\\n\\n The brawl went on and on, and the poor barkeep, Toivo Foamblower, gave up in frustration, falling back against the wall and crossing his thick forearms over his chest. His expression ranged from bemused to resigned, and he didn\u0027t get overly concerned for the damage to his establishment because he knew that the dwarves involved would be quick with reparations.\\n\\n They always were when it came to taverns.\\n\\n One by one the combatants left the bar, usually at the end of a foot or headfirst through the long-since shattered windows.\\n\\n Toivo\u0027s grin grew as the crowd thinned to see that the one who had started it all, Torgar Hammerstriker, was still in the thick of it. That had been Toivo\u0027s prediction from the beginning. Tough Torgar almost never lost a bar brawl when the odds weren\u0027t overwhelming, and he never ever lost when Shingles was fighting beside him.\\n\\n Though not as quick as some others with his fists, the surly old Shingles knew how to wage a battle, knew how to keep his enemies off their guard. Toivo laughed aloud when one raging dwarf charged up to Shingles, raised bottle in hand.\\n\\n Shingles held up one finger and put on an incredulous look that gave the attacker pause. Shingles then pointed at the upraised bottle and wagged his finger when the attacker saw that there were still some traces of beer inside.\\n\\n Shingles motioned for the dwarf to pause and finish the drink. When he did. Shingles brought out his own full bottle, moved as if to take a deep swallow, then smashed it into his attacker\u0027s face, following it with a fist that laid the dwarf low.\\n\\n \"Well, throw \u0027em all out, then!\" Toivo yelled at Torgar, Shingles, and a pair of others when the fight at last ended.\\n\\n The four moved about, lifting semi-conscious dwarves, ally and enemy alike, and unceremoniously tossing them out the broken door.\\n\\n The four remaining combatants started to make their way out then, but Toivo called to Torgar and Shingles and motioned them back to the bar where he was already setting up drinks.\\n\\n \"A reward for the show?\" Torgar asked through fat lips.\\n\\n \"Ye\u0027re paying for the drinks and for a lot more than that,\" Toivo assured him. \"Ye durned fool. Ye thinkin\u0027 to start trouble all across the city?\"\\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t starting no trouble. I\u0027m just sharing the trouble I\u0027m seein\u0027!\"\\n\\n \"Bah!\" the barkeep snorted, wiping a pile of broken glass from the bar. \"What kind o\u0027 greetings did ye think Bruenor\u0027d be getting from Mirabar? His hall\u0027s killin\u0027 our business.\"\\n\\n \"Because they\u0027re better\u0027n us!\" Torgar cried. He stopped short and brought a hand up to his stinging lips. \"They\u0027re making the better armor and the better weapons,\" he said, more in control, and with a bit of a lisp. \"The way to beat \u0027em is to make our own works better or to find new places to sell. The way to beat \u0027em is-\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not arguing yer point and not agreeing with ye, neither,\" Toivo interrupted, \"but ye been running about shouting yer grief all over town. Ye durned fool, can ye be expectin\u0027 any less than ye\u0027re getting? Are ye thinking to raise all the dwarfs against the marchion and the council? Ye looking to start a war in Mirabar?\"\\n\\n \"Course not.\"\\n\\n \"Then shut yer stupid mouth!\" Toivo scolded. \"Ye come in here tonight and start spoutin\u0027 yer anger. Ye durned fool! Ye know that half the dwarfs in here are watching their gold chests withering, and knowing well that the biggest reason for that\u0027s the reopening o\u0027 Mithral Hall. Are ye not to know that yer words aren\u0027t finding open ears?\"\\n\\n Torgar gave a dismissive wave and bent low to his drink, physically closing up as a reflection of his impotence against Toivo\u0027s astute observation.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s got a point,\" said Shingles beside him, and Torgar shot him a glare.\\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t tired o\u0027 the fighting,\" Shingles was quick to add. \"It\u0027s just that we wasted a lot o\u0027 good brew tonight, and that can\u0027t be a good thing.\"\\n\\n \"They got me riled, is all,\" Torgar said, his tone suddenly contrite and a bit defeated. \"Bruenor ain\u0027t no enemy, and making him one instead o\u0027 honestly trying to beat him and his Mithral Hall boys is a fool\u0027s road.\"\\n\\n \"And yerself ain\u0027t never been fond o\u0027 the folks up top. Not the marchion or the four fools that follow him about, scowling like they was some great warriors,\" Toivo said with more than a bit of sympathy. \"Ain\u0027t that the truth?\"\\n\\n \"If Mithral Hall was a human town, ye think the marchion and his boys would be so damned determined to beat \u0027em?\"\\n\\n \"I do,\" Toivo answered without hesitation. \"I just think Torgar Hammerstriker wouldn\u0027t care so much.\"\\n\\n Torgar dropped his head to his arms, folded on the bar. There was truth in that, he had to admit. Somewhere deep inside him was the understanding that Bruenor and the boys from Mithral Hall were kin of the blood. They had all come from the Delzoun Clan, way back beyond the memories of the oldest dwarves. Mithral Hall, Mirabar, Felbarr.. . they were all connected by history and by blood, dwarf to dwarf. On a very basic level, it galled Torgar to think that petty arguments and commerce would come between that all-important bond.\\n\\n Besides, given the evening he had spent with the visitors from Mithral Hall, Torgar had found that he honestly liked them.\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m hopin\u0027 ye\u0027ll stop shouting so we can stop the fighting,\" Shingles said at length. He nudged Torgar, and gave the ringleader a wink when he looked up. \"Or at least slow it down a bit. I\u0027m not a young one anymore. This is gonna hurt in the mornin\u0027!\"\\n\\n Toivo patted Torgar on the shoulder and walked off to begin his clean-up.\\n\\n Torgar just lay there, head down on the bar all the night long. Thinking.\\n\\n And wondering, to his own surprise, if the time was coming for him to leave Mirabar.\\n\\n \"Hope th\u0027 elf don\u0027t catch \u0027em and kill \u0027em tonight,\" Bruenor grumbled. \"He\u0027ll take all the fun.\"\\n\\n Dagnabbit fixed his king with a curious stare, trying hard to read the unreadable. There had only been a pair of tracks, after all, a couple of unfortunate orcs running scared from the rout. The last few days had been the same, chasing small groups, often just one or two, along this mountain trail or that. As Bruenor was complaining, more often than not, Drizzt, Catti-brie, Wulfgar, and Regis had come upon the fleeing creatures first and had them long dead before the main band ever caught up.\\n\\n \"Not many left for catching,\" Dagnabbit offered.\\n\\n \"Bah!\" the dwarf king snorted, placing his empty bowl of stew on the ground beside him. \"More\u0027n half the hunnerd runned off and we ain\u0027t catched a dozen!\"\\n\\n \"But every day\u0027s sending them that\u0027s left into deep holes. We ain\u0027t to chase \u0027em in there.\"\\n\\n \"Why ain\u0027t we?\"\\n\\n The simple question was quite revealing, of course, for Bruenor said it with a raging fire behind his fierce eyes, an eagerness that could not be denied.\\n\\n \"Why\u0027re ye out here, me king?\" Dagnabbit quietly asked. \"Yer dark elf friend and his little band can be doin\u0027 all that\u0027s left to be done, and ye\u0027re knowing it, too!\"\\n\\n \"We got Shallows to get to and warn, along with th\u0027 other towns.\"\\n\\n \"Another task that Drizzt\u0027d be better at, and quicker at, without us.\"\\n\\n \"Nah, the folk\u0027d chase off the damned elf if he tried to warn \u0027em.\"\\n\\n Dagnabbit shook his head. \"Most about are knowing Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, and if not, he\u0027d just send Catti-brie, Wulfgar, or the little one in to warn \u0027em. Ye know the raiding band\u0027s no more, though more\u0027n half did run off. Ye know they\u0027re scattering, running for deep holes, and won\u0027t be threatening anyone anytime soon.\"\\n\\n \"Ye\u0027re figuring that the raiding band\u0027s all there was,\" Bruenor argued.\\n\\n \"If there\u0027s more than that, then all the more reason for yerself to be back in Mithral Hall,\" said Dagnabbit, \"and ye\u0027re knowin\u0027 that, too. So why\u0027re ye here, me king? Why\u0027re ye really here?\"\\n\\n Bruenor settled himself squarely on the log he had taken as a seat and fixed Dagnabbit with a serious and determined stare.\\n\\n \"Would ye rather be out here, with the wind in yer beard and yer axe in yer hands, with an orc afore ye to chop down, or would ye rather be in Mithral Hall, speakin\u0027 to the pretty emissaries from Silverymoon or Sundabar, or arguin\u0027 with some Mirabarran merchant about tradin\u0027 rights? Which would ye rather be doin\u0027, Dagnabbit?\"\\n\\n The other dwarf swallowed hard at the unexpected and direct question. There was a political answer to be made, of course, but one that Bruenor knew, and Dagnabbit knew, would ultimately be a lie.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d be beside me king, because that\u0027s what I\u0027m to do ...\" the young dwarf started to dodge, but Bruenor was hearing none of it.\\n\\n \"Rather, I asked ye. Which would ye rather? Ain\u0027t ye got no preferences?\"\\n\\n \"My duty-\"\\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t askin\u0027 for yer duty!\" Bruenor dismissed him with a wave of his hand. \"When ye\u0027re wanting to talk honestly, then ye come talk to me again,\" he blustered. \"Until then, go and fetch me another bowl o\u0027 fresher stew, cuz this pot\u0027s all crusty. Do yer duty, ye danged golem!\"\\n\\n Bruenor lifted his empty bowl and presented it to Dagnabbit, and the younger dwarf, after a short pause, did take it. He didn\u0027t get up immediately, though.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d rather be out here,\" Dagnabbit admitted. \"And I\u0027d take a fight with an orc over a day at the forge.\"\\n\\n Bruenor\u0027s smile erupted beneath his flaming red beard.\\n\\n \"Then why\u0027re ye asking me what ye\u0027re asking me?\" he asked. \"Are ye thinkin\u0027 that I\u0027m not akin to yerself? Just because I\u0027m the king don\u0027t make me wanting any different from any other Battlehammer.\"\\n\\n \"Ye\u0027re fearing to go home,\" Dagnabbit dared to say. \"Ye\u0027re looking at it as the end o\u0027 yer road.\"\\n\\n Bruenor sat back and shrugged, then noticed a pair of purple eyes staring at him from the brush to the side.\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m still thinking that I\u0027m wanting more stew,\" he said.\\n\\n Dagnabbit stared at him hard for a few moments, chewing his lip and nodding.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m hoping that the durned elf don\u0027t kill \u0027em all tonight meself,\" he said with a grin, and he rose to leave.\\n\\n As soon as Dagnabbit had walked off, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden moved out of the brush and took a seat at Bruenor\u0027s side.\\n\\n \"Already dead, ain\u0027t they?\" Bruenor asked.\\n\\n \"Catti-brie is a fine shot,\" the drow answered.\\n\\n \"Well, go and find some more.\"\\n\\n \"There will always be more,\" the drow replied. \"We could spend all our lives hunting orcs in these mountains.\" He held a sly look over Bruenor until the dwarf looked back at him. \"But you know that, of course.\"\\n\\n \"First Dagnabbit and now yerself?\" Bruenor asked. \"What\u0027re ye wantin\u0027 me to say, elf?\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s in your heart. Nothing more. When first we started on the road, you went with great anticipation, and a skip in your determined stride. You were seeing Gauntlgrym then, or at least the promise of a grand adventure, the grandest of them all.\"\\n\\n \"Still am.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Drizzt observed. \"Our encounter in Fell Pass showed you the trouble your plans would soon enough encounter. You know that once you get back to Mithral Hall, you\u0027ll have a hard time leaving again. You know they will try to keep you there.\"\\n\\n \"Few guesses, elf?\" Bruenor said with a wave of his hand. \"Or are ye just thinkin\u0027 ye know more than ye know?\"\\n\\n \"Not a guess, but an observation,\" Drizzt replied. \"Every step of the way out of Icewind Dale has been heavier than the previous one for Bruenor Battlehammer-every step except those that temporarily turn us aside from our destination, like the journey to Mirabar and this chase through the mountains.\"\\n\\n Bruenor leaned forward and grabbed Dagnabbit\u0027s empty bowl. He gave it a shake, dunked it in the nearly-empty stew pot, then brought it in and licked the thick broth from his stubby fingers.\\n\\n \"Course, in Mithral Hall I might be getting me stew served to me in fine bowls, on fine platters, and with fine napkins.\"\\n\\n \"And you never liked napkins.\"\\n\\n Bruenor shrugged, his expression showing Drizzt that he was certainly catching on.\\n\\n \"Appoint a steward, then, and at once upon your return,\" the drow offered. \"Be a king on the road, expanding the influence of his people, and searching for an even more ancient and greater lost kingdom. Mithral Hall can run itself. If you did not believe that, you never would have gone to Icewind Dale in the first place.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not so easy.\"\\n\\n \"You are the king. You define what a king is. This duty will trap you, and that is your fear, but it will only do so if you allow yourself to be trapped by it. In the end, Bruenor Battlehammer alone decides the fate of Bruenor Battlehammer.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 ye\u0027re making it a bit too easy there, elf,\" the dwarf replied, \"but I\u0027m not saying ye\u0027re wrong.\"\\n\\n He ended with a sigh, and drowned it in a huge gulp of hot stew.\\n\\n \"Do you know what you want?\" Drizzt asked. \"Or are you a bit confused, my friend?\"\\n\\n \"Do ye remember when we first went huntin\u0027 for Mithral Hall?\" Bruenor asked. \"Remember me trickin\u0027 ye by makin\u0027 ye think I was on me dyin\u0027 bed?\"\\n\\n Drizzt gave a little laugh - it was a scene he would never forget. They, leading the folk of Ten-Towns, had just won victory over the minions of Akar Kessell, who possessed the Crystal Shard. Drizzt had been taken in to Bruenor, who seemed on his deathbed-but only so that he could trick the drow into agreeing to help him find Mithral Hall.\\n\\n \"I did not need much convincing,\" Drizzt admitted.\\n\\n \"I thinked two things when we found the place, ye know,\" said Bruenor. \"Oh, me heart was pumping, I tell ye! To see me home again... to avenge me ancestors. I\u0027m tellin\u0027 ye, elf, riding that dragon down to the darkness was the greatest single moment o\u0027 me life, though I was thinkin\u0027 it was the last moment o\u0027 me life when it was happening!\"\\n\\n Drizzt nodded and knew what was coming.\\n\\n \"And what else were you thinking when we found Mithral Hall?\" he prompted, because he knew that Bruenor had to say this out loud, had to admit it openly.\\n\\n \"Thrilled, I was, I tell ye truly! But there was something else ...\" He shook his head and sighed again. \"When we got back from the southland and me clan retook our home, a bit of sadness found me heart.\"\\n\\n \"Because you came to realize that it was the adventure and the road more than the goal.\"\\n\\n \"Ye\u0027re knowin\u0027 it, too!\" Bruenor blurted.\\n\\n \"Why do you think that I, and Catti-brie, were quick to leave Mithral Hall after the drow war? We are all alike, I fear, and it will likely be the end of us all.\"\\n\\n \"But what a way to go, eh elf?\"\\n\\n Drizzt gave a laugh, and Bruenor was fast to join in, and it seemed to Drizzt as if a great weight had been lifted off the dwarf\u0027s shoulders. But the chuckling from Bruenor stopped abruptly, a serious expression clouding his face.\\n\\n \"What o\u0027 me girl?\" he asked. \"What\u0027re ye to do if she gets herself killed on the road? How\u0027re ye not to be blaming yerself forever more?\"\\n\\n \"It is something that I have thought of often,\" Drizzt admitted.\\n\\n \"Ye seen what it done to Wulfgar,\" said Bruenor. \"Made him forget his place and spend all his time looking out for her.\"\\n\\n \"And that was his mistake.\"\\n\\n \"So, ye\u0027re saying ye don\u0027t care?\"\\n\\n Drizzt laughed aloud.\\n\\n \"Do not lead me to places I did not intend to go,\" he retorted. \"I care- of course I do-but you tell me this, Bruenor Battlehammer, is there anyone in all the world who loves Catti-brie, or Wulfgar, more than yourself? Will you then put them in Mithral Hall and hold them safely there?\\n\\n \"Of course you would not,\" Drizzt continued. \"You trust in her and let her run. You let her fight and have watched her get hurt-only recently. Not much of a father, if you ask me.\"\\n\\n \"Who asked ye?\"\\n\\n \"Well, if you did...\"\\n\\n \"If I did and ye telled me that, I\u0027d kick ye in yer skinny elf arse!\"\\n\\n \"If you did and I told you that, you\u0027d kick empty air and wonder why a hundred blows were raining upon your thick head.\"\\n\\n Bruenor scoffed and tossed his bowl to the ground, then pulled off his one-homed helm and began rapping hard on his head.\\n\\n \"Bah! Ye\u0027d need more\u0027n a hunnerd to get through this skull, elf!\"\\n\\n Drizzt smiled and didn\u0027t disagree.\\n\\n Dagnabbit returned then to find his king in a fine mood. The younger dwarf looked at Drizzt, but the drow merely nodded and grinned all the wider.\\n\\n \"If we\u0027re wantin\u0027 to make Shallows in two days, we gotta set straight out,\" Dagnabbit remarked. \"No more chasin\u0027 orcs after this group\u0027s dead.\"\\n\\n \"Then no more chasing orcs,\" said Drizzt.\\n\\n Dagnabbit nodded, seeming neither surprised nor upset.\\n\\n \"Rushing me home, still,\" Bruenor said with a shake of his head, broth flying from his wild beard. He brought a hand up and wiped the beard down.\\n\\n \"Or we might be using Shallows as the front base,\" Dagnabbit offered. \"Put a link line to Pwent an\u0027 his boys at both camps outside o\u0027 Mithral Hall, and spend the summer runnin\u0027 the mountains near to Shallows. The folks\u0027ll appreciate that, I\u0027m thinking.\"\\n\\n A look of astonishment melted into a smile on Bruenor\u0027s face.\\n\\n \"And I\u0027m liking the way ye\u0027re thinking!\" he said as he took the bowl for his third helping. \"Making sure there\u0027s not too much for Rumblebelly when he gets in,\" Bruenor offered between gulps. \"Can\u0027t let him get too fat again if we\u0027re walkin\u0027 mountain roads, now can we?\"\\n\\n Drizzt settled back comfortably and was quite pleased for his dwarf friend. It was one thing to know your heart, another thing to admit it.\\n\\n And something altogether different to allow yourself to follow it.\\n\\n Torgar walked his post on Mirabar\u0027s northern wall, a slight limp in his stride from a swollen knee he had suffered in the previous night\u0027s escapade. The wind was up strong this day, blowing sand all about the dwarf, but it was warm enough so that Torgar had loosened his heavy breastplate.\\n\\n He was well aware of the many looks, scowls mostly, coming at him from the other sentries. His actions with Bruenor had resulted in downward spiral, with arguments growing across the city and with many fists being raised. Torgar was tired of it all. All he wanted was to be left alone to his duties, to walk the wall without conversation, without trouble.\\n\\n When he noted the approach of a well-groomed dwarf wearing bright robes, he knew he wouldn\u0027t get his wish.\\n\\n \"Torgar Hammerstriker!\" Councilor Agrathan Hardhammer called.\\n\\n He moved to the base of the ladder leading to the parapet, hiked up his robes and began to climb.\\n\\n Torgar kept walking the other way, looking out over the wall and feigning ignorance, but when Agrathan called again, more loudly, he realized that to delay would only bring him more frustration.\\n\\n He paused and leaned his strong, bruised hands on the wall, staring out to the empty, open land.\\n\\n Agrathan moved up beside him, and similarly leaned on the wall.\\n\\n \"Another battle last night,\" the councilor stated.\\n\\n \"When they\u0027re askin\u0027 for a fist, they\u0027re getting a fist,\" Torgar replied.\\n\\n \"And how many are ye to fight?\"\\n\\n \"How many\u0027re needin\u0027 a good kick?\"\\n\\n He looked at Agrathan, and saw that the councilor was not amused.\\n\\n \"Yer actions\u0027re tearing Mirabar apart. Is that what ye\u0027re looking to do?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not looking to do anything,\" Torgar insisted, and honestly. He turned to Agrathan, his eyes narrowing. \"If me speaking me mind\u0027s doing what ye say, then the problem\u0027s been there afore I speaked it.\"\\n\\n Agrathan settled more comfortably against the wall and seemed to relax, as if he was not disagreeing.\\n\\n \"Many of us have been shaking our heads at the Mithral Hall problem. Ye know that. We\u0027re all wishin\u0027 that our biggest rivals weren\u0027t Battle-hammer dwarvess! But they are. That\u0027s the way of it, and ye know it, and if ye keep pressing that point into everyone\u0027s nose, ye\u0027re to bend those noses out of shape.\"\\n\\n \"The rivalry and the arguin\u0027 are as much our own fault as the Battle-hammers\u0027,\" Torgar reminded. \"Might that a deal benefiting us both could be fashioned, but how\u0027re we to know unless someone tries?\"\\n\\n \"Yer words aren\u0027t without merit,\" the councilor agreed. \"It\u0027s been suggested and talked about at the Sparkling Stones.\"\\n\\n \"Where most o\u0027 the councilors ain\u0027t dwarfs,\" Torgar remarked, and Agrathan fixed him with a cold stare.\\n\\n \"The dwarves are spoken for, and their thoughts are heard at council.\"\\n\\n Torgar knew from the dwarf\u0027s look and icy tone that he had hit a nerve with Agrathan, a proud and long-serving councilor. He thought for a moment to take back his bold and callous statement, or at least to exclude his present company, but he didn\u0027t. He felt as if he was being carried away by an inner voice that was growing independent of his common sense.\\n\\n \"When ye joined the Axe of Mirabar, you took an oath,\" Agrathan said. \"Are ye remembering that oath, Torgar Hammerstriker?\"\\n\\n Now it was Torgar\u0027s turn to issue a cold stare.\\n\\n \"The oath was to serve the Marchion of Mirabar, not the King of Mithral Hall. Ye might be wise to think on that a bit.\"\\n\\n The councilor patted Torgar on the shoulder-many seemed to be doing that lately-and took his leave.\\n\\n Torgar remembered his oath and weighed that oath against the realities of present day Mirabar. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-thousand-orcs-hunter-s-blades-1/page-14.html","bookId":2140,"book":{"id":2140,"title":"The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1)","description":"Storyline: The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1) \\n This mass market reprint focuses primarily on his signature character, Drizzt Doourden, who has been the subject of most of Salvatore\u0027s best-selling titles for Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
