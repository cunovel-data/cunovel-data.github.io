{"id":95608,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"The wind howled down at them from the peaks to the north, the towering snow-capped Spine of the World Mountains. Just a bit farther to the south, along the roads out of Luskan, spring was in full bloom, fast approaching summer, but at the higher elevations, the wind was rarely warm, and the going rarely easy. Yet it was precisely this course that Bruenor Battlehammer had chosen as the route back to Mithral Hall, walking east within the shadow of the mountains. They had left Icewind Dale without incident, for none of the highwaymen or solitary monsters that often roamed the treacherous roads would challenge an army of nearly five hundred dwarves! A storm had caught them in the pass through the mountains, but Bruenor\u0027s hearty people had trudged on, turning east even as Drizzt and his other unsuspecting friends were expecting to soon see the towers of Luskan in the south before them. Drizzt had asked Bruenor about the unexpected course change, for though this was a more direct route, it certainly wouldn\u0027t be much quicker and certainly not less hazardous. In reply to the logical question, Bruenor had merely snorted, \"Ye\u0027ll see soon enough, elf!\" The days blended into tendays and the raucous hand put more than a hundred and fifty difficult miles behind them. Their days were full of dwarven marching songs, their nights full of dwarven partying songs. To the surprise of Drizzt, Catti-brie, and Wulfgar, Bruenor moved Regis by his side soon after the eastward turn. The dwarf was constantly leaning in and talking to the halfling, while Regis bobbed his head in reply. \"What\u0027s the little one know that we don\u0027t?\" Catti-brie asked the drow as they flanked the caravan to the north, looking back on the third wagon, Bruenor\u0027s wagon, to see Bruenor and Regis engaged in one such discussion. Drizzt just shook his head, not really sure of how to read Regis at all anymore. \"Well, I\u0027m thinking we should find out,\" Catti-brie added, seeing no response forthcoming. \"When Bruenor wants us to know all the details, he will tell us,\" Drizzt assured her, but her smirk made it fairly clear that she wasn\u0027t buying into that theory. \"We\u0027ve turned the both of them from more than one ill-aimed scheme,\" she reminded. \"Are ye hoping to find out right before the cataclysm?\" The logic was simple enough, and in considering the pair on the wagon, and the fact that raucous and none-too-brilliant Thibbledorf Pwent was also serving Bruenor in an advisory position, the drow could only chuckle. \"And what are we to do?\" \"Well, hot pokers won\u0027t get Bruenor talking, even against a birthday surprise,\" Catti-brie reasoned, \"but I\u0027m thinking that Regis has a bit lower tolerance.\" \"For pain?\" Drizzt asked incredulously. \"Or for tricks, or for drink, or for whatever else might work,\" the woman explained. \"Think I\u0027ll be getting Wulfgar to carry the little rat to us when Bruenor\u0027s off about other business tonight.\" Drizzt gave a helpless laugh, understanding well the perils that awaited poor Regis, and glad that Bruenor had taken the halfling into his confidence and not him. As with most nights, Drizzt and Catti-brie set a camp off to the side of the gathering of dwarves, keeping watch, and even more than that, keeping a bit of their sanity aside from Thibbledorf Pwent\u0027s antics and the Gutbuster\u0027s training. Pwent did come over and join the pair this night, though, walking right in and plopping down on a boulder to the side of their fire. He looked at Catti-brie, even reached up to touch her long auburn hair. \"Ah, ye\u0027re looking good, girl,\" he said, and he dropped a sack of some muddy compound at her feet, \"Ye be putting that on yer face each night afore ye go to sleep.\" Catti-brie looked down at the sack and its slimy contents, then up at Drizzt, who was sitting on a log and resting back against a rock facing, his hands tucked behind his head, brushing wide his thick shock of white hair so that it framed his black-skinned face and his purple eyes. Clearly, the battlerager amused him. \"On me face?\" Catti-brie asked, and Pwent\u0027s head bobbed eagerly. \"Let me guess. It will make me grow a beard.\" \"Good and thick one,\" said Pwent. \"Red to match yer hair, I\u0027m hoping. Oh, a fiery one ye\u0027ll be!\" Catti-brie\u0027s eyes narrowed as she looked over at Drizzt once more, to see him choking back a chuckle. \"Make sure ye\u0027re not putting it up too high on yer cheeks, girl,\" the battlerager went on, and now Drizzt did laugh out loud. \"Ye\u0027ll look like that durned Harpell werewolf critter!\" As he finished the thought, Pwent sighed and rolled his eyes longingly. It was well known that the battlerager had begged Bidderdoo Harpell, the werewolf, to bite him so that he too might be afflicted by the ferocious disease. The Harpell had wisely refused. Before the wild dwarf could continue, the trio heard a movement to the side, and a huge form appeared. It was Wulfgar the barbarian, nearly seven feet tall, with a broad and muscled chest. He was wearing a beard to match his blond hair, but it was neatly trimmed, showing the renewed signs of care that had given all the friends hope that Wulfgar had at last overcome his inner demons. Ho carried a large sack over one shoulder, and something inside of it was squirming. \"Hey, what\u0027cha got there, boy?\" Pwent howled, hopping up and bending in curiously. \"Dinner,\" Wulfgar replied. The creature in the sack moaned and squirmed more furiously. Pwent rubbed his hands together eagerly and licked his lips. \"Only enough for us,\" Wulfgar said to him. \"Sorry.\" \"Bah, ye can spare me a leg!\" \"Just enough for us,\" Wulfgar said again, putting his hand on Pwent\u0027s forehead and pushing the dwarf back to arm\u0027s length. \"And for me to bring some leftovers to my wife and child. You will have to go and dine with your kin, I fear.\" \"Bah!\" the battlerager snorted. \"Ye ain\u0027t even kilt it right!\" With that, he stepped up and balled his fist, retracting his arm for a devastating punch. \"No!\" Drizzt, Wulfgar, and Catti-brie all yelled together. The woman and the drow leaped up and rushed in to intercept. Wulfgar, spinning aside, put himself between the battlerager and the sack. As he did, though, the sack swung out wide and bounced off the rock facing, drawing another groan from within. \"We\u0027re wanting it fresh,\" Catti-brie explained to the befuddled battlerager. \"Fresh? It\u0027s still kicking!\" Catti-brie rubbed her hands together eagerly and licked her lips, mimicking Pwent\u0027s initial reaction. \"It is indeed!\" she said happily. Pwent backed off a step and put his hands firmly on his hips, staring hard at the woman, then he exploded into laughter. \"Ye\u0027ll make a good dwarf, girl!\" he howled. He slapped his hands against his thighs and bounded away, back down the slope toward the main encampment. As soon as he was gone, Wulfgar swung the sack over his shoulder and bent low, gently spilling its contents: one very irate, slightly overweight halfling dressed in fine traveling clothes, a red shirt, brown vest, and breeches. Regis rolled on the ground, quickly regained his footing, and frantically brushed himself off. \"Your pardon,\" Wulfgar offered as graciously as he could while stifling a laugh. Regis glared up at him then hopped over and kicked him hard in the shin-which of course hurt Regis\u0027s bare toes more than it affected the mighty barbarian. \"Relax, my friend,\" Drizzt bade him, stepping over and draping his arm over the halfling\u0027s shoulder. \"We needed to speak with you, that is all.\" \"And asking is beyond your comprehension?\" Regis was quick to point out. Drizzt shrugged, \"It had to be done secretly,\" he explained. Even as the words left his mouth Regis began to shrink back, apparently catching on. \"Ye been talking a lot with Bruenor of late,\" Catti-brie piped in, and Regis shrank back even more. \"We\u0027re thinking that ye should be sharing some of his words with us.\" \"Oh, no,\" Regis replied, patting his hands in the air before him, warding them away. \"Bruenor\u0027s got his plans spinning, and he will tell you when he wants you to know.\" \"Then there is something?\" Drizzt reasoned. \"He is returning to Mithral Hall to become the king,\" the halfling replied. \"That is something, indeed!\" \"Something more than that,\" said Drizzt. \"I see it clearly in his eyes, in the bounce of his step.\" Regis shrugged. \"He\u0027s glad to be going home.\" \"Oh, is that where we\u0027re going?\" Catti-brie asked. \"You are. T am going farther,\" the halfling admitted. \"To the Herald\u0027s Holdfast,\" he explained, referring to a renowned library tower located east of Mithral Hall and northwest of Silverymoon, a place the friends had visited years before, when they were trying to locate Mithral Hall so that Bruenor could reclaim the place. \"Bruenor has asked me to gather some information for him.\" \"About what?\" asked the drow. \"Gandalug and Gandalug\u0027s time, mostly,\" Regis answered, and while it seemed to the other three that he was speaking truthfully, they also sensed that he was speaking incompletely. \"And what might Bruenor be needing that for?\" asked Catti-brie. \"I\u0027m thinking that\u0027s a question ye should be asking Bruenor,\" came the gruff reply of a familiar voice, and all four turned to see Bruenor stride into the firelight. \"Ye go grabbing Rumblebelly there, when all ye had to do was ask meself.\" \"And ye\u0027d be telling us?\" Catti-brie asked. \"No,\" said the dwarf, and three sets of eyes narrowed immediately. \"Bah!\" Bruenor recanted. \"Hoping to surprise ye three is hoping for the impossible!\" \"Surprise us with what?\" asked Wulfgar. \"An adventure, boy!\" the dwarf howled. \"As great an adventure as ye\u0027ve ever knowed.\" \"I\u0027ve known a few,\" Drizzt warned, and Bruenor howled. \"Sit yerselfs down,\" the dwarf bade them, motioning to the fire, and all five sat in a circle about the blaze. Bruenor pulled a bulging pack off his back. After dropping it to the ground he pulled it open to reveal packets of food and bottles of ale and wine. \"Though ye\u0027re fancying fresher food,\" he said with a wink to Catti-brie, \"I was thinking this\u0027d do for now.\" They sorted out the meal, and Bruenor hardly waited for them to begin eating before he launched into his tale, telling them that he was truly glad they had pressed the issue, for it was a tale, a promise of adventure, that he desperately wanted to share. \"We\u0027ll be making the mouth o\u0027 the Valley of Khedrun tomorrow,\" he explained. \"Then we\u0027re turning south across the vale, to the River Mirabar, and to Mirabar herself.\" \"Mirabar?\" Catti-brie and Drizzt echoed in unison, and with equal skepticism. It was hardly a secret that the mining city of Mirabar was no supporter of Mithral Hall, which threatened their business interests. \"Ye\u0027re knowing Dagnabbit?\" Bruenor asked, and the friends all nodded. \"Well, he\u0027s a few friends there who\u0027ll be giving us some information that we\u0027re wanting to hear.\" The dwarf paused and hopped up, glancing all around into the darkness as if searching for spies \"Ye got yer cat about, elf?\" the red-bearded dwarf asked. Drizzt shook his head. \"Well, get her here, if ye can,\" Bruenor bade him. \"Send her out about and tell her to drag in any who might overhear.\" Drizzt looked to Catti-brie and to Wulfgar, then reached into his belt pouch and brought forth an onyx figurine of a panther. \"Guenhwyvar,\" he called softly. \"Come to me, friend.\" A gray mist began to swirl around the figurine, growing and thickening, gradually mirroring the shape of the idol. The mist solidified quickly, and the huge black panther Guenhwyvar stood there, quietly and patiently waiting for Drizzt\u0027s instructions. The drow bent low and whispered into the panther\u0027s ear, and Guenhwyvar bounded away, disappearing into the blackness. Bruenor nodded. \"Them Mirabar boys\u0027re mad about Mithral Hall,\" he said, which wasn\u0027t news to any of them. \"They\u0027re looking for a way to get back an advantage in the mining trade.\" The dwarf looked around again, then bent in very close, motioning for a huddle. \"They\u0027re looking for Gauntlgrym,\" he whispered. \u0027\u0027What is that?\" Wulfgar asked. Catti-brie looked equally perplexed, though Drizzt was nodding as if it was all perfectly logical. \"The ancient stronghold of the dwarves,\" Bruenor explained. \"Back afore Mithral Hall, Citadel Felbarr, and Citadel Adbar. Back when we were one big clan, back when we named ourselves the Delzoun.\" \"Gauntlgrym was lost centuries ago,\" Drizzt put in. \"Many centuries ago. Beyond the memory of any living dwarves.\" \"True enough,\" Bruenor said with a wink. \"Now that Gandalug\u0027s gone to the Halls of Moradin.\" Drizzt\u0027s eyes widened -so did those of Catti-brie and Wulfgar. \"Gandalug knew of Gauntlgrym?\" the drow asked. \"Never saw it, for it fell afore he was born,\" Bruenor explained. \"But,\" he added quickly, as the hopeful smiles began to fade, \"when he was a lad the tales of Gauntlgrym were fresher in the mouths o\u0027 dwarves.\" He looked at each of his friends in turn, nodding knowingly. \"Them Mirabar boys\u0027re looking for it under the Crags to the south. They\u0027re looking in the wrong place.\" \"How much did Gandalug know?\" Catti-brie asked. \"Not much more than I knew about Mithral Hall when first we went a\u0027 lookin\u0027,\" Bruenor admitted with a snort. \"Less even. But it\u0027ll be an adventure worth making if we\u0027re finding the city. O, the treasures, I tell ye! And metal as good as anything ye\u0027ve e\u0027er seen!\" He went on and on about the legendary crafted pieces of the Gauntlgrym dwarves, about weapons of great power, armor that could turn any blade, and shields that could stop dragonfire. Drizzt wasn\u0027t really listening to the specifics, though he was watching every movement from the fiery dwarf. By the drow\u0027s estimation, the adventure would be well worth the risks and hardships whether or not they ever found Gauntlgrym. He hadn\u0027t seen Bruenor this animated and excited in years, not since the first foray to find Mithral Hall. As he looked around at the others, he saw the eager gleam in Catti-brie \u0027s green eyes and the sparkle in Wulfgar\u0027s icy blue orbs-further confirmation to him that his barbarian friend was well on the road to recovery from the trauma of spending six years at the clawed hands of the demon Errtu. The fact that Wulfgar had taken on the responsibilities of husband and father, Delly and the baby never far from him even in their present camp, was all the more reassuring. Even Regis, who had no doubt heard this tale many times already along the road, leaned in, drawn to the dwarf\u0027s tales of dungeons deep and treasures magical. It occurred to Drizzt that he should ask Bruenor why they all had to go to Mirabar, where they wouldn\u0027t likely be welcomed. Couldn\u0027t Dagnabbit go in alone or with a small group, less conspicuously? The drow held his thoughts, though, understanding it well enough. He hadn\u0027t been with Bruenor in Icewind Dale when the first reports of antagonism from Mirabar had been sent to him from King Gandalug. He and Catti-brie had been sailing the Sword Coast at that time, but when they had found Bruenor back in Icewind Dale, the dwarf had pointed it out more than once, a simmering source of anger. Openly, the Council of Sparkling Stones, the ruling council of Mirabar, comprised of dwarves and men, spoke warmly of Mithral Hall, welcoming their brothers of Clan Battlehammer back to the region. Privately, though, Bruenor had heard over the years many reports of more subtle derogatory comments from sources close to the Council of Sparkling Stones and Elastul, the Marchion of Mirabar. Some of the plots that had caused Gandalug headaches had been traced back to Mirabar. Bruenor was going there for no better reason than to look some of the folk of Mirabar straight in the eye, to make a proclamation that the Eighth King of Mithral Hall had returned as the Tenth King, and he was one a bit more clued in to the subterfuge of the present day politics of the wild north. Drizzt just sat back and watched his friends\u0027 continuing huddle. The adventure had begun, it seemed, and it was one the drow believed he would truly enjoy. Or would he? For something else occurred to Drizzt then, a memory quite unexpected. He recalled his first visit to the surface, a supposed great adventure alongside his fellow dark elves. Images of the slaughter of the surface elves swirled through his thoughts, culminating in the memory of a little elf girl he had smeared with her own mother\u0027s blood, to make it appear as if she too had been mortally wounded. He had saved her that terrible day, and that massacre had, in truth, been the first real steps for Drizzt away from his vile kinfolk. And, all these years later, he had killed that same elf child. He winced as he saw Ellifain again, across the room in the pirate cavern complex, mortally wounded and pleased by the thought that in sacrificing herself, she had taken Drizzt with her. On a logical level, the drow could surely understand that nothing that had happened that day was his fault, that he could not have foreseen the torment that would follow that rescued child all these decades. But on another level, a deeper level, the fateful fight with the anguished Ellifain had struck a deep chord within Drizzt Do\u0027Urden. He had left Icewind Dale full of anticipation for the open road, and indeed, he was glad to be with his friends, traveling the wilds, full of adventure and excitement. But the keen edge of a purpose beyond material gain, beyond finding ancient kingdoms and ancient treasure, had been dulled. Drizzt had never fancied himself a major player in the events of the wider world. He had contented himself in the knowledge that his actions served those around him in a positive way. From his earliest days in Menzoberranzan, he had held an innate understand of the fundamental differences between good and evil, and he had always believed that he was a player for the side of justice and goodness. But what of Ellifain? He continued to listen to the excited talk around him and held fast his consenting smile, assuring himself that he would indeed enjoy this newest adventure. He had to believe that. There was nothing pretty about the open air city of Mirabar. Squat stone buildings and a few towers sat inside a square stone wall. Everything about the place spoke of efficiency and control, a no-nonsense approach to getting their work done. To the sensibilities of a dwarf like Bruenor, that made Mirabar a place to be admired to a point, but to Drizzt and Catti-brie as they approached the city\u0027s northern gate, Mirabar seemed an unadorned blotch, uninteresting and unremarkable. \"Give me Silverymoon,\" Drizzt remarked to the woman as they walked along to the left of the dwarven caravan. \"Even Menzoberranzan\u0027s a prettier sight,\" Catti-brie replied, and Drizzt could only agree. The guards at the north gate seemed an apt reflection of Mirabar\u0027s dour attitude. Four humans stood in pairs on opposite ends of sturdy metallic doors, halberds set on the ground and held vertically before them, silver armor gleaming in the early morning sun. Bruenor recognized the crest emblazoned on their tower shields, the royal badge of Mirabar, a deep red double-bladed axe with a pointed haft and a flaring, flat base, set on a black field. The approach of a huge caravan of dwarves, a veritable army, surely shook them all, but to their credit, they held their posture perfect, eyes straight ahead, faces impassive. Bruenor brought his wagon around, moving to the front of the caravan, Pwent\u0027s Gutbusters running to keep their protective guard to either flank. \"Bring her right up afore \u0027em,\" Bruenor instructed his driver, Dagnabbit. The younger, ye How-bearded dwarf gave a gap-toothed grin and urged his team on faster, but the Mirabar guards didn\u0027t blink. The wagon skidded to a stop short of the closed doors and Bruenor stood up tall (relatively speaking) and put his hands on his hips. \"State your business. State your name,\" came a curt instruction from the inner guard on the right. \"Me business is with yer Council o\u0027 Sparkling Stones,\" Bruenor answered. \"I\u0027ll be tellin\u0027 it to them alone.\" \"You will answer the appointed gate guard of Mirabar, visitor,\" the inner guard on the left hand side of the doors demanded. \"Ye think?\" Bruenor asked. \"And ye\u0027re wantin\u0027 me name? Bruenor Battlehammer\u0027s the name, ye durned fool. King Bruenor Battlehammer. Now ye go and run that name to yer council and we\u0027ll be seeing if they\u0027re to talk to me or not.\" The guards tried to hold their posture and calm demeanor, but they did glance over at each other, hastily. \"Ye heared o\u0027 me?\" Bruenor asked them. \"Ye heared o\u0027 Mithral Hall?\" A moment later, one of the guards turned to the guard standing beside him and nodded, and that man produced a small horn from his belt and blew a series of short, sharp notes. A few moments later, a smaller hatch cunningly cut into the large portals, banged open and a tough-looking, many-scarred dwarf wearing a full suit of battered plate mail, ambled out. He too wore the badge of the city, emblazoned on his breastplate, as he carried no shield. \"Ah, now we\u0027re getting somewhere,\" Bruenor remarked. \"And it does me old heart good to see that ye\u0027ve a dwarf for a boss. Might be that ye\u0027 re not as stupid as ye look.\" \"Well met. King Bruenor,\" the dwarf said. \"Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker at yer service.\" He bowed low. his black beard sweeping the ground. \"Well met, Torgar,\" Bruenor replied, offering a gracious bow of his own, something that he, as head of a nearby kingdom, was certainly not required to do. \"Yer guards here serve ye well at blocking the way and better as fodder!\" \"Trained \u0027em meself,\" Torgar responded. Bruenor bowed again. \"We\u0027re tired and dirty, though the last part ain\u0027t so bad, and looking for a night\u0027s stay. Might ye be opening the doors for us?\" Torgar leaned to one side and the other, taking a good look at the caravan, shaking his head doubtfully. His eyes went wide and he shook his head more vehemently when he glanced to his right, to see a human woman standing off to the side beside a drow elf. \"That ain\u0027t gonna happen!\" the dwarf cried, pointing a stubby finger Drizzt\u0027s way. \"Bah, ye heared o\u0027 that one, and ye know ye have,\" Bruenor scolded. \"The name Drizzt ringing any bells in yer thick skull?\" \"It is or it ain\u0027t, and it ain\u0027t making no difference anyway,\" Torgar argued. \"No damned drow elf\u0027s walkin\u0027 into me city. Not while I\u0027m the Topside Commander of the Axe of Mirabar!\" Bruenor glanced over at Drizzt, who merely smiled and bowed deferentially. \"Not fair, but fair enough, so he\u0027s stayin\u0027 out,\" Bruenor agreed. \"What about me and me kin?\" \"Where\u0027re we to put five hunnerd o\u0027 ye?\" Torgar asked sincerely, correctly estimating the force\u0027s size. He held his large hands out helplessly to the side. \"Could send a bunch to the mines, if we let anyone into the mines. And that we don\u0027t!\" \"Fair enough,\" Bruenor replied. \"How many can ye take?\" \"Twenty, yerself included,\" Torgar answered. \"Then twenty it\u0027ll be.\" Bruenor glanced at Thibbledorf Pwent and nodded. \"Just three o\u0027 yers,\" he ordered, \"and me and Dagnabbit makes five, and we\u0027ll be adding Rumblebelly . . .\" He paused and looked at Torgar. \"Ye got any arguing to do about me bringing a halfling?\" Torgar shrugged and shook his head. \"Then Rumblebelly makes six,\" Bruenor said to Dagnabbit and Pwent. \"Tell th\u0027 others to pick fourteen merchants wanting to go in with some goods.\" \"Better to take me whole brigade,\" Pwent argued, but Bruenor was hearing none of it. The last thing Bruenor wanted in this already tenuous circumstance was to turn a group of Gutbuster battleragers loose on Mirabar. In that event Mithral Hall and Mirabar would likely be at open war before the sun set. \"Ye pick the two goin\u0027 with ye, if ye\u0027re planning on going,\" Bruenor explained to Pwent, \"and be quick about it.\" A short while later, Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker led the twenty dwarves through Mirabar s strong gate. Bruenor walked at the front of the column, right beside Torgar, looking every bit the road-wise, adventure-hardened King of Mithral Hall spoken of throughout the land. He kept his many-notched, single-bladed axe strapped on his back, but prominently displayed atop the foaming mug shield that was also strapped there. He wore his helmet, with one horn broken away, like a badge of courage. He was a king, but a dwarf king, a creature of pragmatism and action, not a flowered and prettily dressed ruler like those common among the humans and elves. \"So who\u0027s yer marchion these days?\" he asked Torgar as they crossed into the city. Torgar\u0027s eyes widened. \"Elastul Raurym,\" he replied, \"though it\u0027s no name ye need be thinking of.\" \"Ye tell him I\u0027m wanting to talk with him,\" Bruenor explained, and Torgar\u0027s eyes widened even more. \"He\u0027s fillin\u0027 his meetings for the spring in the fall, for the summer in the winter,\" Torgar explained. \"Ye can\u0027t just walk in and get an audience ...\" Bruenor fixed the dwarf with a strong, stern gaze. \"I\u0027m not gettin\u0027 an audience,\" he corrected. \"I\u0027m granting one. Now, ye go and get a message to the marchion that I\u0027m here for the talking if he\u0027s got anything worth hearing.\" The sudden change in Bruenor\u0027s demeanor, now that the gates were behind him, clearly unsettled Torgar. His off-balance surprise fast shifted to a grim posture, eyes narrowing and staring hard at his fellow dwarf. Bruenor matched that stare-more than matched it. \"Ye go an\u0027 tell him,\" he said calmly. \"And ye tell yer council and that fool Sceptrana that I telled ye to tell him.\" \"Protocol. . .\" \"Is for humans, elves, and gnomes,\" Bruenor interrupted, his voice stern. \"I ain\u0027t no human, I sure ain\u0027t no elf, and I\u0027m no bearded gnome. Dwarf to dwarf, I\u0027m talking here. If yerself came to me Mithral Hall and said ye needed to see me, ye\u0027d be seeing me, don\u0027t ye doubt.\" He finished with a nod, and dropped his hand hard on Torgar\u0027s shoulder. That little gesture, more than anything previous, seemed to put the sturdy warrior at ease. He nodded, his expression grim, as if he had just been reminded of something very important. \"I\u0027ll be telling him,\" he agreed, \"or at least, Til be tellin\u0027 his Hammers to be tellin\u0027 him.\" Bruenor smirked at that, and Torgar shuffled. Against the obvious disdain of the dwarf King of Mithral Hall, the inaccessibility of the Marchion of Mirabar to one of his trusted shield dwarf commanders did indeed seem a bit trite. \"I\u0027ll be tellin\u0027 him,\" Torgar said again, with a bit more conviction. He led the twenty visitors away then to a place where they could stay the night, a large and unremarkable stone house with several sparsely furnished rooms. \"Ye can set up yer wagons and goods right outside,\" Torgar explained. \"Many\u0027ll be comin\u0027 to see ye, I\u0027m sure, \u0027specially for them little white trinkets ye got.\" He pointed to one of the three wagons that had come in with the visitors, its side panels tinkling with many trinkets as it bounced along the rough ground. \"Scrimshaw,\" Bruenor explained. \"Carved from knucklehead trout. Me little friend here\u0027s good at it.\" He motioned to Regis, who blushed and nodded. \"Ye make any of the stuff on the wagon?\" Torgar asked the half ling, and the dwarf seemed genuinely interested. \"A few pieces.\" \"Ye show me in the morning,\" Torgar asked. \"Might that I\u0027ll buy a few.\" With that, he nodded and left them, heading off to deliver Bruenor\u0027s invitation to the marchion. \"You turned him over quite well,\" Regis remarked. Bruenor looked at him. \"He was ready for a fight when we first arrived,\" the halfling observed. \"Now I believe he\u0027s thinking of leaving with us when we go.\" It was an exaggeration, of course, but not ridiculously so. Bruenor just smiled. He had heard from Dagnabbit of many curses and threats being hurled against Mithral Hall from Mirabar, and surprisingly (or not so, when he thought about it), more seemed to be coming from the dwarves of Mirabar than from the humans. That was why Bruenor had insisted on coming to this city where so many of his kinfolk were living in conditions and climate much more fitting to human sensibilities than to a dwarf\u0027s. Let them see a true dwarf king, a legend of their people come to life. Let them hear the words and ways of Mithral Hall. Maybe then, many of Mirabar\u0027s dwarves would stop whispering curses against Mithral Hall. Maybe then, the dwarves of Mirabar would remember their heritage. \"It\u0027s troubling ye that they wouldn\u0027t let ye in,\" Catti-brie remarked to Drizzt a short time later, the two of them on a high bluff to the east of the remaining dwarves and the caravan, overlooking the city of Mirabar. Drizzt turned to regard her curiously, and saw sympathy etched on his dear friend\u0027s face. He realized that Catti-brie was reacting to his own wistful expression. \"No,\" he assured her. \"There are some things I know I can never change, and so I accept them as they are.\" \"Yer face is saying different.\" Drizzt forced a smile. \"Not so,\" he said-convincingly, he thought. But Catti-brie\u0027s returning look showed him that she saw better. The woman stepped back and nodded, catching on. \"Ye\u0027re thinking of the elf,\" she reasoned. Drizzt looked away, back toward Mirabar, and said, \"I wish we could have saved her.\" \"We\u0027re all wishing that.\" \"I wish you had given the potion to her and not to me.\" \"Aye, and Bruenor would\u0027ve killed me,\" Catti-brie said. She grabbed the drow and made him look back at her, a smile widening on her pretty face. \"Is that what ye\u0027re hoping?\" Drizzt couldn\u0027t resist her charm and the much-needed levity. \"It is just difficult,\" he explained. \"There are times when I so wish that things could be different, that tidy and acceptable endings could find every tale.\" \"So ye keep trying to make them endings acceptable,\" Catti-brie said to him. \"It\u0027s all ye can do.\" True enough, Drizzt admitted to himself. He gave a great sigh and looked back to Mirabar and thought again of Ellifain. Dagnabbit went out later that afternoon, the sun setting and a cold wind kicking up through the streets of the city. He didn\u0027t return until right before the dawn, and spent the day inside with Bruenor, discussing the political intrigue of the city and the implications to Mithral Hall, while the merchants and Regis worked their wagons outside. Not many came to those wagons -a few dwarves and fewer humans - and most of those who did bargained for deals so poor that the Clan Battlehammer dwarves ultimately refused. The lone exception arrived soon after highsun. \"Well, show me yer work, halfling,\" Torgar bade Regis. A dozen heads, those of Torgar\u0027s friends, bobbed eagerly behind him. \"Regis,\" the halfling explained, extending his hand, which Torgar took in a firm and friendly shake. \"Show me, Regis,\" the dwarf said. \"Me and me friends\u0027ll need a bit o\u0027 convincing to be spendin\u0027 our gold pieces on anything ye can\u0027t drink!\" That brought a laugh from all the dwarves, Battlehammer and Mirabarran alike, and from Regis. The halfling was wondering if he should consider using his enchanted ruby necklace, with its magical powers of persuasion, to \"convince\" the dwarves of a good deal. He dismissed that thought almost immediately, though, reminding himself of how stubborn some dwarves could be against any kind of magic. Regis also considered the implications on the relationship between Mithral Hall and Mirabar should he get caught. Still, soon enough it became apparent to Regis that he wouldn\u0027t need the pendant\u0027s influence. The dwarves had come well stocked with coin, and many of their friends joined them. The goods on the wagons, Regis\u0027s work and many other items, began to disappear. From the window of the house, Bruenor and Dagnabbit watched the bazaar with growing satisfaction as dozens and dozens of new patrons, almost exclusively dwarves, followed Torgar\u0027s lead. They also noted, with a mixture of apprehension and hope, the grim faces of those others nearby, humans mostly, looking upon the eager and animated trading with open disdain. \"I\u0027m thinking that ye\u0027ve knocked a wedge down the middle o\u0027 Mirabar by coming here,\" Dagnabbit observed. \"Might be that fewer curses\u0027ll flow from the lips o\u0027 the dwarfs here when we\u0027re on the road out.\" \"And more curses than ever\u0027ll be flowing from the mouths o\u0027 the humans,\" Bruenor added, and he seemed quite pleased by that prospect. Quite pleased indeed. A short while later, Torgar, carrying a bag full of purchases, knocked on the door. \"Ye\u0027re coming to tell me that yer marchion\u0027s too busy,\" Bruenor said as he answered the knock, pulling the door open wide. \"He\u0027s got his own business, it seems,\" Torgar confirmed. \"Bet he didn\u0027t answer yer knock,\" Dagnabbit remarked from behind Bruenor. Torgar shrugged helplessly. \"How about yerself?\" Bruenor asked. \"And yer boys? Ye got yer own business, or ye got time to come in and share some drink?\" \"Got no coins left.\" \"Didn\u0027t ask for none.\" Torgar chewed his lip a bit. \"I can\u0027t be speaking as a representative o\u0027 Mirabar,\" he explained. \"Who asked ye to?\" Bruenor was quick to reply. \"A good dwarf\u0027s putting more into his mouth than he\u0027s spilling out. Ye got some tales to tell that I ain\u0027t heared, to be sure. That\u0027s more than worth the price o\u0027 some ale.\" And so, with Torgar\u0027s agreement, they had a party that night in the unremarkable stone house on the windswept streets of Mirabar. More than a hundred Mirabarran dwarves made an appearance, with most staying for some time, and many sleeping right there on the floor. Bruenor wasn\u0027t surprised to find the house surrounded by armed, grim-faced soldiers -humans, not dwarves -when daylight broke. It was lime for Bruenor and his friends to go. Torgar and his buddies would find a bit of trouble over this, no doubt, but when Bruenor looked back at him with concern, the tough old veteran merely winked and grinned. \"Ye find yer way to Mithral Hall, Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker!\" Bruenor called back to him as the wagons began to roll back out the gates. \"Ye bring all the friends ye want, and all the tales ye can tell! We\u0027ll find enough food and drink to make ye belch, and a warm bed for as long as ye want to warm yer butt in it!\" No one on the caravan from Icewind Dale missed the scowls the human guards offered at those dangerous remarks. \"You do like to cause trouble, don\u0027t you,\" Regis said to Bruenor. \"The marchion was too busy for me, eh?\" Bruenor replied with a smirk. \"He\u0027ll be wishing he met with me, don\u0027t ye doubt.\" Drizzt, Catti-brie, and Wulfgar linked up with Bruenor\u0027s wagon when it and the others had rejoined the bigger caravan outside the city gates. \"What happened in there?\" the dark elf asked. \"A bit o\u0027 intrigue, a bit o\u0027 fun,\" Bruenor replied, \"and a bit o\u0027 insurance that if Mirabar e\u0027er decides to openly fight against Mithral Hall, they\u0027ll be missing a few hunnerd o\u0027 their shorter warriors!\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-thousand-orcs-hunter-s-blades-1/page-3.html","bookId":2140,"book":{"id":2140,"title":"The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1)","description":"Storyline: The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1) This mass market reprint focuses primarily on his signature character, Drizzt Doourden, who has been the subject of most of Salvatore\u0027s best-selling titles for Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
