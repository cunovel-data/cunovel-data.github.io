Others pulled hard at the largest wagon-the orc god statue discarded-that bore the wounded, including King Bruenor Battlehammer. On the cart with him rode Regis, who was too injured to do much of anything else, and Pikel Bouldershoulder, the doo-dad, who used his enchanted berries and roots on Bruenor\u0027s wounds. \"He\u0027ll draw out the sickness,\" Ivan assured Wulfgar and Tred as they ran along behind that wagon. \"Me brother\u0027s got some tricks, he does.\" Wulfgar nodded grimly and took heart in the words, for Catti-brie had told him a short while before that Bruenor did seem to be resting more easily. \"Ain\u0027t that that\u0027s worrying me,\" Tred put in. \"We\u0027re seeing orc sign all about, and if they come on now. . . .\" \"They will be without their giant friends, who were left on the other side of the ravine,\" Wulfgar insisted. \"True enough,\" Tred admitted, though his dour expression did not brighten, \"but I\u0027m thinking we\u0027ll be finding a tougher fight with them orcs, even with yer boys from Mithral Hall here, when them orcs ain\u0027t so surprised that yer boys from Mithral Hall\u0027re here!\" There really wasn\u0027t much that Wulfgar could say against such logic. He had seen the orc force, and he knew that those legions, despite being scattered and with many slaughtered outside of Shallows, would still prove overwhelming to this contingent in a level fight. Even as they had begun the run the previous day, they had all known that their only real hope was that the orcs had been too scattered to regroup in time to catch them before they reached the safety of Mithral Hall, or at least before they met up with the dwarven army rolling out of that fortress. But already the signs were showing their hopes to be in vain. All through the night-in which the dwarves, utilizing more of Pikel\u0027s wondrous berries, had kept moving-they had heard the calls of worgs, left and right, shadowing them. Earlier the second day, they had caught sight of a dust cloud rising in the north, not so far behind, and they knew that they were being pursued. Pwent had proposed a possible scenario to them that morning. The battlerager figured that the orc worg-riders would flank and circle in front of the dwarves, trying to slow their run, thus giving the pursuing main force time to catch up and overwhelm them. The dwarves had decided that if such a blockade had been formed, they would lower their heads and blast straight through it. Wulfgar could only hope that it didn\u0027t come to that. They barely had enough to take turns pulling the wagon of wounded, and Pwent and his boys were reaching the end of their tolerance. Pikel\u0027s berries were amazing indeed, but they did not provide magical strength. They merely allowed the body to draw on its deeper resources. After the run to the north, the desperate fight, and the beginning of the run back to the south, Wulfgar could plainly see that those reserves were reaching their end. Even worse, those who had come from the prolonged defense of Shallows, himself included, were all carrying grievous wounds. Another fight would likely be the end of all of them and at the least would eliminate any hope Wulfgar had of getting his beloved father back to Mithral Hall alive. And so that afternoon, when scouts reported a growing cloud of dust to the west, the barbarian moved to the wagon to join Catti-brie, Regis, and Bruenor. \"That\u0027ll mark the end of it,\" Catti-brie remarked, staring out at the cloud. Her demeanor, so removed from the ever-optimistic presence that Wulfgar had always known, caught him off guard and surprised Regis as well. \"We\u0027ll fight them and beat them!\" Regis replied. \"And if more catch us, we\u0027ll fight them, too!\" \"Indeed,\" Wulfgar agreed. \"I would not see Aegis-fang in the hands of an orc, even if that means I must kill every orc in all the North. And I will see Bruenor back to Mithral Hall, where he will find his strength anew and resume the throne that is so rightfully his.\" The words were empowering to both Regis and Catti-brie, and their appreciative looks to Wulfgar became grins and even laughter when Pikel Bouldershoulder chimed in with an enthusiastic \"Oo oi!\" The dwarves closed ranks around the wagons, though they maintained their swift pace. Pwent began directing his charges, moving his most seasoned fighters to the delicate areas of defense, and calling out to his boys to be ready. At one point, he moved beside the wagon. \"There\u0027ll be a few hunnerd of \u0027em, judging by what me scouts\u0027re seeing,\" the battlerager explained. He added with an exaggerated wink, \"Nothing me and me boys can\u0027t handle.\" Wulfgar nodded, as did the others, but they all knew the truth of the matter. Being intercepted by several hundred orcs would be bad enough, but even if they could indeed win out against such odds, they would find themselves caught by an equal or larger group from behind because of the inevitable delay. \"Take up your bow,\" Wulfgar bade Catti-brie as he handed her Taulmaril. \"Shoot well.\" \"Perhaps T could go out under a flag of truce and speak with them,\" Regis offered, pointedly pulling the enchanted ruby pendant over his shirt collar. Wulfgar shook his head. \"They\u0027d have ye dead even if ye managed to snare a few o\u0027 them with yer lies,\" Catti-brie remarked. \"Promises, not lies,\" Regis corrected. He shrugged helplessly and looked down at the ruby then tucked it away. The dwarven ranks tightened. It was obvious that they had been spotted by the intercepting force, and their choices were few. A turn to the east would likely put them into another group of orcs, and to stop and try to form some semblance of defense might bring the pursuing orcs upon them as well. They plowed ahead, gripping weapons in one hand, wagon yokes in the other. \"We gotta make that ridge afore \u0027em!\" Thibbledorf Pwent cried to his fellows, pointing ahead to some higher ground. The dwarves responded by lowering their aching shoulders even more and charging on. They reached the base of the ridge and started up the slope, hardly slowing. But they didn\u0027t get there first. \"The wing is not broken, but it is bruised badly and will not carry Sunset for any distance,\" Innovindil told Tarathiel when he and Sunrise returned to her in the mountain cave, some miles north east of the place where they had battled the giants. Even with the glancing hit by the thrown rock, they had managed to outdistance the pursuing giants and had been fortunate to find a cave where they could put up for the time being. \"The giants have given up the chase, I believe,\" Tarathiel replied. \"They will not find us.\" \"But neither will we get back to the Moonwood anytime soon,\" Innovindil reasoned, \"or at least, not both of us.\" Her expression as she finished was as clear a signal to Tarathiel that she wanted him to climb onto Sunrise and fly off for home as if she had spoken the words directly. \"I am not certain that our report to our people would be complete enough to properly prepare them for what is to come,\" he replied somberly. \"What have you seen?\" Tarathiel\u0027s expression held a grim edge. \"They are crawling out of their holes,\" he told her, \"all to the north and the west. The orcs and goblins are rising as one, and we have seen that the giants, too, are with them. I fear that the force that sacked the town of Shallows is but a small portion of what we will discover.\" \"Then all the more reason for you to fly to our people.\" Tarathiel looked to his mount and seemed, for just a moment, to be leaning that way, but then he looked back at his companion and stood resolute. \"I\u0027ll not leave you,\" he said. \"The elves of the Moonwood will not be caught off their guard, whether I fly there or not.\" Innovindil started to argue but changed her mind almost immediately. She did not want to be left out there alone, however brave she might sound. She did not know the region as did Tarathiel, and she truly feared for Sunrise. Though the pegasus would survive the wound, it had been so valiant in holding its position above the giants through the pain and shock that the elf had no intention of allowing Sunrise to do anything but heal, even if protecting the pegasus was at the cost of her own life. She knew that Tarathiel felt the same way. \"And we have something else to learn, and now may be our only chance to do so,\" Tarathiel added after a short pause. \"You believe that the dark elf escaped the fight with the giants,\" Innovindil reasoned. \"It is possible that Ellifain is out there, as well.\" \"It is probable that Ellifain is dead,\" said Innovindil, and Tarathiel could only nod. Initial shock, the adrenaline of an approaching, desperate battle, fast shifted to confusion among the ranks of the battleragers and the others in the fleeing caravan, for there, on the ridge before them, stood dwarves- a host of dwarves-and arrayed with the colors not of Mithral Hall, but with the axe symbol of Mirabar. \"Who are ye, and what\u0027re ye about?\" the lead dwarf cried, and he lifted his helm back off his face. \"Torgar!\" Regis cried, surely recognizing the dwarf. A perplexed expression came over the dwarf\u0027s face, and he motioned to his fellows to spread wide, left and right. He, along with several others, came down to the ragtag group. \"Well, yer King Bruenor\u0027s got our weapons, and so\u0027s Mithral Hall, whatever his fate,\" Torgar proclaimed when Wulfgar and the others filled him in on the desperate battle and the retreat to Mithral Hall. \"We come out to ask King Bruenor for his friendship, and now I\u0027m thinking we can prove our own to him and his. Ye just keep on yer run and me and mine\u0027ll follow ye close.\" \"Ye let me and me own run with ye, Torgar o\u0027 Mirabar,\" Thibbledorf Pwent cut in as he stepped forward, showing his ridged, bloodstained armor in all its gory glory. \"We give them orcs a reason to run!\" \"Luck has shone upon us,\" Wulfgar whispered to Catti-brie a moment later, as the five hundred reinforcements found positions around the retreating caravan. They both looked to Bruenor and to Pikel, still tirelessly tending the dwarf king and the other wounded. Apparently sensing their looks, Pikel turned to regard them and offered a wink and a hopeful nod. Catti-brie couldn\u0027t help but smile but then couldn\u0027t help but look back to the north. \"You\u0027re thinking of Drizzt,\" Wulfgar observed. \"As soon as we get Bruenor back to Mithral Hall, we\u0027ll head out to find him,\" Regis said, joining in on the conversation. Catti-brie shook her head with even greater resolve. \"He will see to himself and trust that we will see to our safety and the security of Mithral Hall. When his job is done out there, he will come home.\" Both Wulfgar and Regis looked at her with surprise, but both inevitably agreed. Without information to the contrary, they knew they had to trust in Drizzt, and in truth, who in all the world was better suited to survive in the hostile environment of the orc-infested North? More practically, none of them were really fit to head back out. Certainly Regis was in no shape to be walking a dangerous road anytime soon. Catti-brie continued to stare to the north, and without even realizing it, she began chewing nervously on her bottom lip. Wulfgar grabbed her forearm and gave a gentle, comforting squeeze. \"Elastul told you?\" Nanfoodle asked Shoudra when the two met up in the corridor of their building a few nights later. \"He instructed me to go with you,\" Shoudra replied, her tone making it clear that she was none too pleased with the order. \"He has erred and continues to do so,\" the little gnome said. \"First he chases Bruenor off, then imprisons Torgar, and now . . .\" \"This is hardly the same thing,\" said Shoudra. \"Is it so different? Will the remaining dwarves in Mirabar be pleased when they learn of our antics in Mithral Hall? Do we even have a hope of succeeding there, given that more than four hundred of Mirabar\u0027s dwarves will precede our arrival?\" \"Elastul is counting on just that fact to gain us the confidence of Bruenor and his kin.\" \"To what end? Treachery?\" asked the glum gnome. Shoudra started to respond, but just shrugged. \"We will see what we find when we arrive in Mithral Hall,\" she said after a moment\u0027s reflection. Nanfoodle considered her words and her demeanor for a moment, then his face brightened. \"I plan to follow your lead in the cavern of Clan Battlehammer,\" he said, \"even if that lead diverges from the edicts of Marchion Elastul.\" Shoudra looked around cautiously, her expression bidding the gnome to speak no more of such foolishness. In her own heart, though, the Sceptrana did not disagree. Elastul\u0027s edict had been direct and simple; Go to Mithral Hall and check on the traitor dwarves, and while they\u0027re there, do some serious damage to their rival\u0027s operations. Better, Shoudra thought, that they go to Mithral Hall to reach out to King Bruenor through Torgar Hammerstriker and the others. After the disaster that had befallen Mirabar, they might find a new and stronger alliance with their fellow mining city, one that would benefit them all. She could only sigh and wish things were different, though, for she knew Elastul well enough to understand the absurdity of even hoping that she could realize such a outcome.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-thousand-orcs-hunter-s-blades-1/page-30.html","bookId":2140,"book":{"id":2140,"title":"The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1)","description":"Storyline: The Thousand Orcs (Hunter\u0027s Blades #1) This mass market reprint focuses primarily on his signature character, Drizzt Doourden, who has been the subject of most of Salvatore\u0027s best-selling titles for Wizards of the Coast, Inc.
