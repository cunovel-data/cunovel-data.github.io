He and Tucker were walking through the remains of the compound, Rex and Alexandra close behind, as the sun struggled up over the horizon. \"You did a pretty good job of it.\" \"That\u0027s \u0027cause your mother made sure of it.\" \"How d\u0027you think I\u0027ll do?\" \"I always figured you\u0027d be real good at it. Plus, you got a good woman to help you along.\" The ground was covered with spent cartridges and a layer of ash that swirled around their feet as they walked. The ash was all that remained of those who had died the night before. The occasional limb sheltered by the shade they kicked out into the pale sunlight where it quickly dissolved. In the center of the courtyard, the crucifix that had felled Lazarus lay gleaming. Tucker picked it up and shined it on the bandages around his shoulder. The motion, since it pained him, was slow and deliberate. \"Ain\u0027t much left of him and his dreams.\" \"That ain\u0027t true. There\u0027s you and Lizzie. And your kid. That\u0027s enough.\" \"Hard to believe something good can come from all this.\" \"At least you got the girl.\" They sat down on the steps. \"Wouldn\u0027t have if it hadn\u0027t been for you.\" \"Glad I could help. It\u0027s just a real good thing Lenny showed up.\" Dad scuffed his heel in the sand. \"Where is he?\" \"Calling June, I imagine.\" \"And Sully?\" \"He made it back just a little bit ago. He\u0027s in his coffin, sleeping like a baby now that Julius is gone.\" \"He\u0027s for sure gone?\" Tucker nodded, remembering Lizzie\u0027s half-crazed look when she had returned, her mother\u0027s pendant clutched in her hand and blood smeared all over her face. They were silent for awhile, listening to the wind. \"Love sure is a funny business,\" Tucker said at last. \"Reckon I\u0027m gonna head back in, check on Lizzie.\" He stood up. \"Comin?\" \"Directly,\" Dad said. \"The sun feels nice on my face.\" \"Well, c\u0027mon, Rex.\" Rex watched curiously as Tucker stood and started off. He made it halfway across the courtyard, the ash drifting around his boots and already disappearing into the desert. Abruptly, he turned and rejoined Dad on the steps. Rex pushed his head into his lap and Tucker petted him, smoothing his fur down. \"Maybe I will sit a spell. I always did like the sunrise,\" he said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-cowboy-and-vampire/page-34.html","bookId":2496,"book":{"id":2496,"title":"The Cowboy and Vampire","description":"Storyline: Saddle up for a hilarious, existential gallop through the dying American west with an army of ancient bloodsuckers in hot pursuit.
