{"id":106060,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"\"Go quickly, quickly,\" Sully hissed in alarm. \"There are far too many of them for us to fight here.\" Lizzie hurried through the garden, carrying Tucker, while Sully and his contingent kept their enemies at bay. Nothing could keep her from getting Tucker to safety Adrenaline rushed through her body, she was fearless, and her eyes dared anyone to stand in her way. Underneath the thought of Tucker\u0027s safety was a burning desire for revenge. She\u0027d be back, back for Julius, if anything happened to Tucker.\\n\\n Once outside, Lizzie saw the waiting van with an agitated Vampire standing beside the open door. Sully\u0027s troops scattered quickly into the darkened streets of Manhattan as Sully himself turned to help Lizzie lay Tucker into the van. They stretched him out on the floor and Rex jumped in, whining and licking anxiously at his pale face.\\n\\n \"We have to get him to a doctor,\" Lizzie said, holding her hands over the wound to staunch the blood. It pooled over her hands and the warmth of it felt oddly comforting, though her concern for him far overrode even the hunger.\\n\\n \"And we will,\" Sully said breathlessly. \"Go, go,\" he shrilled to the driver who ground the ignition to life and roared down the street. Behind them, a crowd of Vampires spilled out into the street, some carrying automatic weapons that twinkled in the distance. The rear window shattered, the sound of breaking glass mixed with the screaming sirens of police responding to the battle. Lizzie involuntarily covered her ears, then laid herself over Tucker and shielded Rex, but no more bullets reached the van as they screeched around the corner, out of sight.\\n\\n \"Well, well, well, that was surely exciting,\" Sully said, breathing heavily He turned and beamed at Lizzie. \"Lizzie, so good to see you again. You look absolutely stunning.\"\\n\\n Lizzie looked down at herself, the tatters of her dress, soil smudged deeply into her skin. \"Mr. Sully, I believe we owe you our freedom, if not our lives.\"\\n\\n \"Never mind that, it\u0027s just so nice to see you again. You have grown so enchanting. The turning has done you wonders.\"\\n\\n \"Please don\u0027t take this the wrong way, but could you please get us to a doctor. We will have time to catch up on our lives, or deaths,\" she corrected herself, \"after Tucker is seen to. And if I\u0027m not mistaken, we don\u0027t have much time until the sunrise.\"\\n\\n \"Right you are. So practical. Dakalus,\" he called to the driver, \"to Dr. Philippi\u0027s.\"\\n\\n Dr. Vesu Philippi, as Sully explained on the way, was a doctor of most impressive credentials. He was a Vampire of immense learning, having studied with Hippocrates himself. Though of course his leanings were, understandably, directed toward the Vampire physiology, Sully was convinced he knew more of Adamites than all their textbooks and practitioners combined. His penthouse overlooked the Hudson as it emptied into the harbor. As Dakalus and his crew spread out in the shadows to post guard, Sully buzzed the intercom by the door.\\n\\n \"Yes?\" a rich, baritone voice inquired.\\n\\n \"Vesu, it\u0027s Sully I need your help. It\u0027s an emergency.\"\\n\\n \"Of course, of course, let me open the door.\" The lock clicked and Sully led Lizzie, carrying Tucker in her arms, and Rex into the lobby. They took the elevator to the top, Sully\u0027s nonstop conversation blending subtly with the drip of blood from Tucker\u0027s still form.\\n\\n The elevator opened into the foyer of the penthouse, onto Dr. Philip-pi\u0027s worried countenance. He was tall and thin, his features pinched as if the immense knowledge in his mind drew heavily from the flesh. His hair was gray at the temples and he wore a severely cut frock coat that sparkled with hidden highlights. His eyes flared at the sight of Lizzie and the limp body in her arms.\\n\\n \"Heavens,\" he exclaimed, striding quickly to relieve her of the weight. \"This way quickly\" He looked back over his shoulder to catch Sully\u0027s eyes and his look mirrored surprise. \"This is an Adamite.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" Sully said. \"A very important one.\"\\n\\n \"Can you help him?\" Lizzie asked. \"He\u0027s hurt very badly.\"\\n\\n \"Indeed, indeed,\" Dr. Philippi said absently, laying him on a leather-covered couch. He pulled the shirt away gently and fresh blood welled up. \"Oh, my.\"\\n\\n \"What? Is it bad?\"\\n\\n The doctor stripped his coat off, rolling up the sleeves of his starched white shirt. \"It appears to be superficial, extensive, but superficial. It has been so very long,\" he said, shaking his head.\\n\\n \"So long? What has been so long? You mean since he was hurt?\"\\n\\n \"I mean since I have worked on an Adamite. Fascinating.\" He looked up at Lizzie. \"For the last several centuries, I have confined my practice to certain maladies that affect the Vampire mind and extensive research into, well, the effects of sunlight and sharp wooden implements.\"\\n\\n \"I do so hope you are making progress in those areas,\" Sully tittered.\\n\\n Dr. Philippi shook his head. \"Not as much as I might hope.\" He hurried off, only to return with an old-fashioned black bag which, when opened, revealed shining rows of surgical instruments. After a thorough examination and a litany of mumbles and exclamations, he began to clean the wound with alcohol and old-fashioned gauze swabs. Tucker groaned from the depths of his unconsciousness and Rex barked fiercely at the doctor. Lizzie held him to her with one hand, reassuring him. He sat down to regard the doctor with open hostility but deferred to Lizzie.\\n\\n He held a compress to Tucker\u0027s wound while probing underneath in the ripped flesh. \"What did this?\"\\n\\n \"Elita,\" Sully said with a conspiratorial nod of his head.\\n\\n \"Ah, so this must be the infamous cowboy, making you,\" he nodded at Lizzie, \"our very special concern, which Lazarus has gone to great pains to locate. I see he has found you.\"\\n\\n \"He hasn\u0027t found anybody until Tucker is okay. He is going to be okay, isn\u0027t he?\"\\n\\n \"It appears she missed vital organs, though I can\u0027t quite remember exactly which are vital and which are not.\" He withdrew a thin silver needle from the bag and pulled a piece of surgical thread through the eye. Setting the compress aside, he began sewing meticulously and silently. Once completed, he turned his attention to the gash on Tucker\u0027s arm, already crusted shut. \"Luckily he sleeps the sleep of the dead,\" he said, now stitching down the gash. \"Which, if I am not mistaken, we also will be doing before long.\" He glanced at the window and the hint of dawn evident there.\\n\\n Lizzie could feel the pull of death already in her mind and body \"But I can\u0027t leave him alone.\"\\n\\n \"I assure you,\" Dr. Philippi said as he examined the contents of a dark cupboard and finally selected a smoky colored bottle, \"he will be quite all right by midday I had the good fortune to spend several centuries under the tutelage of a renowned Taoist healer who came remarkably close to distilling immortality\" He held the bottle up and swirled the liquid contents. \"The tonic properties of this elixir are astounding. Though your paramour will undoubtedly be in a considerable amount of pain, his vitality will be quite high.\" He opened it and it seemed to Lizzie a vapor of emerald smoke escaped as the doctor tipped the bottle into Tucker\u0027s mouth. Tucker\u0027s body twitched and Dr. Philippi covered him gently with a starched sheet.\\n\\n \"I have to leave him a note,\" Lizzie exclaimed.\\n\\n \"Too late for that,\" Sully said, taking her by the arm and pointing at the window. The sun peeked over the edge of the horizon and a terrible raging pain filled the room.\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll wake up alone,\" she said, reaching toward him, but already shafts of first light lanced through the window and gnawed at\\n\\n the blackness settling into her mind.\\n\\n Sully and Dr. Philippi pulled her into the inner chamber and the comforting darkness there. \"Quickly, into the casket,\" Sully said, helping her in. \"He will be there when you arise.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-cowboy-and-vampire/page-23.html","bookId":2496,"book":{"id":2496,"title":"The Cowboy and Vampire","description":"Storyline: Saddle up for a hilarious, existential gallop through the dying American west with an army of ancient bloodsuckers in hot pursuit.
