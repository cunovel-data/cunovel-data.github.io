{"id":82648,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"SIX\n LITTLE FEARS\n Bird song filled the morning air along McClain Terrace, and fingers of sunlight moved in the forest beyond Kay\u0027s kitchen windows as she started breakfast. Laurie wasn\u0027t yet awake, but that was okay because starting next week she\u0027d have to be getting up around seven-thirty to go to the day-care center while Kay drove on to George Ross Junior College, a few miles north of Ebensburg. Evan was showering upstairs, and as Kay put the water on to boil for coffee, she heard the noise of the shower cease.\n When she was getting the cups - white with a dark blue band around the rim - out of the cupboard, her hands suddenly trembled and she dropped one of them onto the linoleum-tiled floor. It cracked, teethlike chips flying out in all directions, and she called herself a stupid ass and put the broken cup into the trash can.\n But the truth was that a spring had begun winding itself tight within her.\n She envisioned the inside of a pocket watch her grandfather Emory had once shown her, all the tiny gears clicking and turning, the mainspring coiling itself tighter and tighter as he wound it with his age-spotted hand. Won\u0027t it break, Pa-Pa? she\u0027d asked him. And then it won\u0027t be good anymore? But he\u0027d only smiled and wound it as tight as it would wind, and then he\u0027d let her hold it and watch the gears go around, choking in what seemed to her a mechanical frenzy.\n Perhaps now, she thought, the main spring that controlled her nerves and heartbeat and even the workings of her mind was being wound by an invisible hand. An invisible Pa-Pa. Wound and wound and wound until she could feel the first threatening throb of pain erupt at her temples. She opened a drawer, searched through it for the bottle of Bufferin she\u0027d placed there the day before; she took two with a glass of water. That helped a little bit. But they were tension headaches, stubborn and painful, and very often so bad the Bufferin did nothing against them. She shrugged her shoulders to ease the tight band across her back. The water began to boil on the stove. To her the kettle\u0027s whistle sounded like a shriek. She reached for the pot, feeling the heat on her hand, and lifted it off the glowing eye. At the same time she concentrated on dismissing the nagging fears that seemed to have crept up around her, vaporish things that might have stepped through the woodwork. Things that had followed them from LaGrange and now sat watching her, grinning and chuckling, from perches atop the counter or the cupboards. In the war of nerves they always won.\n In another few minutes she heard Evan coming down the stairs.\n He came into the kitchen wearing a pale blue short sleeved shirt and gray slacks, and kissed her on the cheek as she fried bacon. He smelled of soap, and his hair was still damp. \"Good morning,\" he said.\n \" \u0027Morning.\" She swept a mental hand across the kitchen, and those little fears scuttled away into nooks and crevices to wait. She smiled and returned his kiss. \"Breakfast is almost ready.\"\n \"Great,\" he said, and looked out the windows across the sun-and-shadow-dappled woodland. \"It\u0027s going to be a pretty day. Isn\u0027t Laurie awake yet?\"\n \"No,\" Kay said. \"There\u0027s no reason for her not to sleep late.\"\n Evan nodded. He glanced toward the sky, half-expecting to see looming factory chimneys and a reddish tinge of industrial smoke, but there were only the distant clouds against a soft blue. How many mornings, he wondered, had he stood at the single kitchen window in that LaGrange house and seen that smudge of blood in the sky?\n Those cramped, low-ceilinged rooms had been like a cage, except the bars were of wood instead of bamboo. And in that dark brick building far beyond the company parking lot the Gentleman waited, except this time the Gentleman had a name and his name was Harlin.\n Evan\u0027s mind sheered away from all that, and he let the sunlight reflected off the trees warm his face; but in backing away from those thoughts he remembered the nightmare, with its Bethany\u0027s Sin road sign and its shadowy thing emerging from a cloud of dust.\n Something tightened suddenly at the base of his spine. What could that dream-form have been? he wondered; what evil, twisted thing reaching for him? Only the Shadow knows, he told himself. And even the Shadow can be wrong.\n \"Here we are,\" Kay said, putting the breakfast dishes on the small circular table in the kitchen.\n Evan sat down, and Kay joined him. They ate in silence for a few minutes; in an elm tree in the backyard a blue jay screeched and then wheeled for the sky. After a while Evan cleared his throat and looked up at her from his plate; he caught her gaze and held it. \"I\u0027d like to tell you what my dream was last night...\"\n She shook her head. \"Please. I don\u0027t want to hear it...\"\n \"Kay,\" he said quietly, \"I want to talk about it. I\u0027ve got to get it out in the open where I can see it clearly and try to understand it.\"\n He put his fork down and sat silently for a moment. \"I know my...\n dreams frighten you. I know they make you uncomfortable. But they frighten me much, much more, because I have to live with them. I wish to God I didn\u0027t; I wish I could turn my back on them or run away from them or...something, but I can\u0027t. All I\u0027m asking is that you help me understand.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to hear it,\" Kay said firmly. \"There\u0027s no sense in talking about your dreams with me, because I refuse to see them as you do. For Christ\u0027s sake, Evan, you torture yourself with them!\" She leaned slightly over the table toward him, ignoring that haunted, pleading look in his eyes that she had seen so often. \"And you insist on trying to torture Laurie and me with them as well! Everyone has dreams, but not everyone believes that their dreams are going to influence their lives somehow! When you start doing that, you\" -\n she searched carefully for the correct words - \"make them come true yourself!\"\n Evan sipped at his coffee and put the cup back in its saucer; there was a tiny chip on the rim. \"I don\u0027t dream like a normal person does,\" he said. \"You must realize that by now. I\u0027ll sleep without dreaming for months at a time, and when they finally come they\u0027re...\n very strange. And real. Terrible and threatening; different from ordinary dreams. And always they try to tell me something...\"\n \"Evan!\" Kay said sharply, more sharply than she\u0027d intended.\n Slashed, Evan looked at her and blinked, and she dropped her fork down onto the table. \"I don\u0027t care what you say or think,\" she told him, trying hard to keep herself under control. Her temples throbbed.\n Oh, no! she told herself. Damn it damn it here come those headaches! \"They are not premonitions. There are no such things as premonitions.\" She held his gaze, wouldn\u0027t let him look away. \"You make those things come true by your own actions, don\u0027t you see that? Can\u0027t you realize that it\u0027s you?\" Bitterness rose in her throat, tasting like an amalgam of salt water, bile and blood. \"Or are you too blind to see it?\"\n He kept staring at her, his face frozen into the mask he wore when she struck out at him. In the backyard a robin warbled on and on.\n Kay rose and took her plate over to the sink. There was no use in talking to him about this thing; of all the tiny day-to-day thorns that pricked their marriage, this was the largest and the sharpest.\n This had drawn blood and tears. And what was most terrible, Kay thought, was that it was a hopeless situation: Evan was never going to stop seeing his dreams as a window onto some other world, and she was never going to agree with his often utterly ridiculous\n \"premonitions.\" Those things that had come true in the past had come about due only to him, not to anything supernatural. Not to Destiny, nor to Evil, but only to Evan Reid. And the simple truth of the matter was for her the most painful: he had allowed those dreams to shape his own life and, worse, their life together. Middle class gypsies, she told herself, almost humorously. Carrying our crystal ball with us. Living in fear when the dreams told Evan there was going to be a fire in the apartment building - he\u0027d left the electric heater on one morning, a frayed wire had shot sparks, a lot of smoke but not much damage. His fault again. Living in fear under Eddie Harlin - don\u0027t think about that! - and so many other times.\n And now it\u0027s begun again, she told herself. Only one day here, where there are so many opportunities for all of us, and it\u0027s already started. And why? Yes. Because he\u0027s afraid. Isn\u0027t that what the Veterans Administration psychologist, Dr. Gellert, had said years ago? Evan has a problem trusting people, the doctor had told her in one of those terrible sessions. There\u0027s a great deal of stress within Evan, Mrs. Reid; it\u0027s a result of the war, his feelings about himself, his idea that he\u0027s personally responsible for many of the things that happened. It seems to be a complex problem; it goes back to his relationship with his parents and, especially, his older brother, Eric...\n Evan finished his coffee and brought the plates over to the sink.\n \"Okay,\" he said. \"I know they disturb you; I know they frighten you.\n So we won\u0027t talk about them anymore.\" He waited for her response, and finally she turned toward him.\n \"They do scare me,\" Kay said. \"And you scare me when you believe in them so much. I\u0027m sorry I get upset, Evan; I\u0027m sorry I don\u0027t understand, but...we\u0027ve both got to put those bad things behind us.\" She paused for a moment, watching his eyes. \"All right?\"\n \"Yes,\" Evan said, nodding. \"All right.\"\n Kay reached out and took his hand, drawing him toward the windows. \"Look at that,\" she said. \"A whole forest for us to wake up to in the mornings. And that clear, blue sky. Did you ever make cloud-pictures when you were a child? What does that large one over there look like to you?\"\n Evan looked at it. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"What do you think?\"\n \"A face,\" Kay said. \"Someone smiling. See the eyes and the mouth?\"\n To Evan it looked like an archer, but he didn\u0027t say anything.\n \"I wonder what the rain looks like through these windows? Or the snow?\"\n Evan smiled and put his arm around her. \"I doubt if we\u0027ll see very much snow this summer.\"\n \"It must be entirely white,\" Kay said. \"And the branches thick with icicles. And in the spring and the fall it\u0027ll be different again.\"\n She turned toward him and looked into his eyes; he\u0027d pushed away the haunted darkness, for a little while at least, and for this she was grateful. She put her arms around him. \"It\u0027s going to be good,\" she said. \"Just like we\u0027ve always wanted every thing to be. I\u0027ve got my teaching position, you\u0027ll be writing, Laurie\u0027s going to be meeting new friends and having a real home; that\u0027s very important to her right now.\"\n \"Yes, I know it is.\" He held onto her and looked out across the forest. It would be beautiful under a cover of snow. And then in the spring, as the first green buds appeared on the thousands of bare brown limbs, there would be nothing in sight but fresh green and the slow and sure growth of new thicket; and in the autumn, as the weather cooled day by day, the trees would take on the appearance of fire, the leaves scorched with gold and red and yellow, slowly turning brown and curling, dropping to the earth. Beyond those windows Nature would be constantly changing her colors, like a beautiful woman with many dresses. It pleased Evan that there was so much beauty to look forward to, for in the past few years there had been achingly little.\n There was a sudden bing-bong! from the entrance foyer. The doorbell, Evan realized.\n \"I\u0027ll see who it is,\" Kay said; she squeezed her husband\u0027s hand briefly and then turned away from the kitchen windows, going out through the den and a connecting corridor to the entrance foyer.\n Through the panes of frosted glass set into the door she saw the head of the person on the other side; she unlocked and opened the door.\n It was a woman, perhaps in her late thirties, wearing a canary yellow tennis outfit; a locket initialed with the letters J and D hung around her neck. Her flesh sun-tanned but amazingly unlined, she looked as if she practically lived outdoors, and in her rather square-jawed but attractive face her gaze was steady and calm. She held a basket of tomatoes. \"Mrs. Reid?\" she said.\n \"Yes, that\u0027s right.\"\n \"It\u0027s so good to meet you. I\u0027m Janet Demargeon.\" The woman motioned with a tilt of her head. \"Your next door neighbor.\"\n \"Oh, yes,\" Kay said, \"of course. Please come in, won\u0027t you?\"\n She stepped back and the woman came into the entrance foyer.\n The aroma of freshly mown grass wafted in through the open door, reminding Kay of wide, luxuriously green pastures.\n \"I see you\u0027re all moved in,\" Mrs. Demargeon said, swinging her- gaze in toward the living room. \"How pretty.\"\n \"Not quite,\" Kay told her. \"there\u0027s still some furniture to buy.\"\n \"Well, it\u0027s coming along nicely.\" The woman smiled again and offered her the basket. \"From my garden. I thought you might like some fresh tomatoes this morning.\"\n \"Oh, they\u0027re beautiful,\" Kay said as she took them. They were, too; large and red and unblemished. Mrs. Demargeon walked past her into the living room and looked around. \"Just a hobby,\" she said. \"Everyone should have a hobby, and gardening\u0027s mine.\"\n Kay motioned for her to sit down, and she did, in a chair near the picture window. \"it\u0027s so nice and cool in here,\" Mrs. Demargeon said, fanning her face with a red-nailed hand. \"My air conditioning has been breaking down since the first of June; it\u0027s a real problem getting the Sears serviceman over from the Mall.\"\n \"Can I get you something? A cup of coffee?\"\n \"I\u0027d love some iced tea. With plenty of ice.\"\n Evan, hearing the voices, came through the foyer into the living room. Kay introduced them and showed him the tomatoes; Evan took the woman\u0027s outstretched hand and shook it, finding it as hard and dry as a man\u0027s. Her eyes were very attractive though, green veined with hazel, and her dark brown hair was swept back from her face. Glints of blond showed in it. Kay took the tomatoes back to the kitchen and left them alone.\n \"Where are you and your wife from, Mr. Reid?\" Mrs.\n Demargeon asked him when he\u0027d settled himself on the sofa.\n \"We\u0027ve been living in LaGrange; it\u0027s a small mill town near Bethlehem.\"\n Mrs. Demargeon nodded. \"I\u0027ve heard of it. Were you with the mill?\"\n \"In a way. I was a writer and copy editor for Iron Man, the mill\u0027s public-relations journal. Mostly I wrote headlines.\"\n \"A writer\u0027?\" She raised her eyebrows. \"Well! I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve ever had a writer in the village before. Have you ever had anything published?\"\n \"A few things. I had a short story in fiction magazine in April, and before that an article on truck drivers in a CBer\u0027s publication.\n There\u0027ve been some other articles and short stories, all in .minor markets. Things like that.\"\n \"Interesting. At least you\u0027ve seen some money from your efforts; I\u0027m sure that\u0027s a lot more than most can say. Do you have a job here in the village, or in Johnstown?\"\n Evan shook his head. \"I\u0027m looking. We left LaGrange because of some...well, complications. And Kay\u0027s going to be teaching during the summer session at George Ross.\"\n \"Oh? Teaching what?\"\n \"Basic algebra,\" Kay said, bringing Mrs. Demargeon\u0027s glass of tea across the room to her. The woman sipped at it gratefully.\n \"Strictly a summer-session course, but I\u0027m hoping for a math concepts course in the fal1.\" She sat down beside Evan.\n \"That sounds way over my head,\" Mrs. Demargeon said.\n \"Anyone who can handle that has my immediate respect. I saw you drive in yesterday; wasn\u0027t there a little girl with you?\"\n \"Our daughter, Laurie,\" Kay said. \"I think she\u0027s still sleeping.\"\n \"Too bad. I\u0027d like to meet her sometime. She looked like such a pretty, sweet little child. How old is she?\"\n \"Just turned six in May,\" Kay told her.\n \"Six.\" The woman smiled, looked from Kay to Evan. \"A beautiful age. Then she\u0027ll be attending first grade at Douglas in September? That\u0027s a fine school.\"\n \"Mrs. Demargeon...\" Evan began, leaning forward slightly.\n \"Please. Janet.\"\n \"Okay; Janet. I noticed the street was very dark last night. Are all the houses on McClain Terrace occupied?\"\n \"Yes, they are. But most of the people on the Terrace are early-to-bed, early-to-rise types. A bit sedate, if you get my meaning. Also, I believe the Rices are on vacation this month; they drive up into the Allegheny forest to do some camping every summer.\"\n \"What about the house directly across the street from us?\" Evan asked her. \"I didn\u0027t see any lights at all over there last night.\"\n \"Oh? Well, I suppose Mr. Keating may be on vacation, too. As a matter of fact, I haven\u0027t seen his car there for a few days. He\u0027s a widower, but I believe he has relatives living in New York; he may be visiting them. He\u0027s a very nice man; I\u0027m sure \u0027ll like him.\"\n She smiled and sipped at her tea. \"Oh, how cooling that is! Of course, June isn\u0027t really our hot month in Bethany\u0027s Sin. It\u0027s August you have to watch out for. That\u0027s the killer month; everything wilts.\n And dry. My God, is it dry! She swung her gaze over toward Kay.\n \"So. Have you met many of the villagers yet?\"\n \"You\u0027re the first neighbor we\u0027ve met,\" Kay said. \"Of course, we know Mrs. Giles, but that\u0027s about it.\"\n \"It takes time, I\u0027m sure. I wouldn\u0027t worry. They\u0027re friendly people.\" She shifted her eyes to Evan. \"Most of them are, at least; some of them, the ones who live in those large houses down near the Circle, stay to themselves. Their families have lived in the village for a few generations, and, Jesus Christ, they\u0027re more family conscious than the DAR!\"\n Kay smiled; she felt relaxed with this woman, and glad that she\u0027d\u0027 come over to make them feel welcome. It was, after all, an indication that they were being accepted into the village, if only by one neighbor. And acceptance was always a good feeling.\n \"The Circle\u0027s very beautiful,\" Evan was saying.\n \"Someone\u0027s gone to a lot of trouble and expense to keep those flowers looking nice.\"\n \"The Beautification Committee does it. Let\u0027s see. Mr. and Mrs.\n Holland, Mrs. Omarian, Mr. and Mrs. Brecker, Mr. Quarles. A few others. They take turns planting and watering and weeding and such as that. They wanted me on the committee last year, but I had to turn it down. That garden of mine keeps me close enough to the earth.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure it does,\" Evan said. \"I was wondering: what\u0027s that large house over on Cowlington? I can see its roof from my front yard.\"\n Mrs. Demargeon paused for a moment. \"Large house? Let\u0027s see.\n Oh, right! That\u0027s the museum.\"\n \"Museum?\" She nodded. \"Built by the historical society.\"\n \"What kinds of things are in there?\" Kay asked her.\n Mrs. Demargeon smiled wryly. \"Junk, dear. Just junk.Those society ladies think junk and dust make history. don\u0027t even waste your time going over there, because usually the place is locked up tighter than a drum! Do you play tennis, Mrs. Reid?\"\n \"Please call me Kay. Oh, I used to play a little bit, but I haven\u0027t in quite some time.\" \"Great! This place could use another tennis player! At least we do. I\u0027m in a tennis club - the Dynamos - and we play every Tuesday morning at ten over on the courts just down the hill. There\u0027re five of us: Linda Paulson, Anne Grantham, Leigh Hunt, Jean Quarles, and me. Maybe you\u0027d like to play some Tuesday?\"\n \"Maybe,\" Kay said. \"It depends on my classes.\"\n \"Of course.\" The woman finished her tea and put the empty glass on a table beside her. The ice cubes clicked together. She rose, and Evan and Kay did the same. \"I\u0027d better be getting on,\" Mrs.\n Demargeon said, moving toward the front door. Stopping to look back, she asked, \"Are you two bridge players?\"\n \"Afraid not,\" Evan said.\n \"How about canasta? Poker? It doesn\u0027t matter. I want both of you over at my house on Friday night. Can you do that?\"\n Kay glanced at Evan; he nodded. \"Yes,\" she said. \"Of course.\"\n \"Perfect.\" She looked down at her wristwatch and made an irritated face. \"Oops! I\u0027m running late! Leigh\u0027s waiting for me over at Westbury. Kay, I\u0027ll call you later on in the week and we\u0027ll set up things for Friday, all right?\" She opened the front door, moved out onto the steps, \"Well, have a good day. And I hope you enjoy the tomatoes.\" She waved a hand, gave them one last smile, and then walked off along the pathway to the sidewalk. Kay watched her for a moment and then closed the door. She put her arm around Evan.\n \"She\u0027s very nice. I\u0027ll take something over there on Friday. How about potato salad?\"\n He nodded. \"Okay.\"\n There was a noise on the stairs, and Laurie came down, still in her pea green pajamas, rubbing sleep from her eyes.\n \"Hi, honey,\" Kay said. \"Do you want some breakfast?\"\n She yawned. \"Cheerios.\"\n \"Cheerios it is. How about some banana slices on top?\" Kay took the little girl\u0027s hand and moved toward the den.\n \"Mrs. Demargeon didn\u0027t say anything about her husband,\" Evan said, and Kay looked back at him quizzically.\n \"Her husband? What about him?\"\n He shrugged. \"Nothing, really. I saw him on their front porch yesterday, and Mrs. Giles told me he\u0027d been in an accident several years ago. He\u0027s paralyzed and in a wheelchair.\"\n \"Mrs. Demargeon is probably sensitive about his condition,\"\n Kay said. \"What kind of accident was it?\"\n \"Car crash.\"\n \"God,\" Kay said softly. \"That\u0027s awful.\" Brief flickering images of ripped metal, blank staring headlights, gashed flesh and nerves, swept over her. That could have happened to us once, she heard a voice inside her say. Stop that! \"I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll meet him on Friday.\"\n She tugged at Laurie\u0027s hand. \"Come on, honey, let\u0027s get your breakfast.\" They disappeared into the den, and for a moment Evan stood where he was in the corridor, surrounded by shadow and shards of sunlight. After a while he realized he was working his knuckles, and he remembered doing that a long time ago, while he\u0027d waited inside a bamboo cage. While he\u0027d waited for them to come for him and make him scream. He shrugged his shoulders, almost unconsciously, as if shrugging off an uncomfortable coat or an old, age wrinkled skin. He moved into the living room, stood where he could draw aside a curtain and look out the window at the Demargeon house next door.\n \"Evan?\" Kay was calling him from the kitchen. \"Where are you?\"\n He didn\u0027t answer, thinking numbly that she was trying to keep track of him as she would Laurie. The Demargeons\u0027 driveway was on the other side of the house, and in another moment he saw their car - a white Honda Civic - back out and then turn away in the direction of the Circle. Only one person was in it.\n And as he watched, Evan thought he saw a shadow move across one of the windows facing his house. Moving slowly and with effort.\n Moving in a wheelchair.\n \"Evan?\" Kay called, the hint of disturbance in her voice barely hidden.\n He looked up. \"In the living room,\" he said. And she was quiet.\n He heard Laurie ask something about how many children would be at the day-care center. Kay said she didn\u0027t know, but she was sure they\u0027d all be nice.\n The shadow was gone from the window. Evan turned away.\n Out in the cradling branches of an elm in the front yard, a bird began to sing. The notes rang out across McClain Terrace and echoed away into silence. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bethany-s-sin/page-6.html","bookId":2472,"book":{"id":2472,"title":"Bethany\u0027s Sin","description":"Storyline: \n Set in a village in which the women get caught up in occult rituals and wholesale slaughter perpetuated in the name of the Amazon women, the goddess of the cult being incarnated in the form of the town\u0027s female mayor.
