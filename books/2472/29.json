{"id":82671,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"TWENTY-NINE\\n\\n EVAN, WAITING. FOR THE NIGHT\\n\\n Evan\u0027s search of the Demargeon house turned up six empty Coke bottles beneath the kitchen sink. He withdrew two of them, carried them downstairs to the basement, and began to sift through the assortment of boxes for suitable rags - not too dirty, thin enough to be jammed into the necks of the bottles. When he found two rags he could use, he filled the bottles about three-fourths of the way to the top with lighter fluid. He twisted the rags and fit them into the Coke bottles as fuses for his makeshift firebombs.\\n\\n Then he went back upstairs to wait. At the top of the stairs, he recradled the telephone, afraid a prolonged busy signal would attract suspicion.\\n\\n He was going to have to create a diversion, something that would allow him time to get to the Mabry Clinic and find Kay; he\u0027d already decided he was going to set fire to the Demargeon house, and with those two firebombs he could pick a couple of other targets and unleash enough confusion to shield him. But there was another problem: where was Laurie? The Drago house? The Sunshine School? Yes. Possibly there, under the watchful eye of whatever hideous entity lay within Mrs. Omarian\u0027s form. And now, as the hours moved sluggishly through the afternoon, Evan kept a surreptitious watch from the living room, moving the window curtains aside perhaps half an inch, one eye peering through at McClain Terrace.\\n\\n At first it seemed deserted, but as Evan looked he caught the shadowy outline of a figure sitting before a window in a house diagonally across the street. And another figure in the house next door to where Keating had been murdered. They were both sentries, watching the street. Probably Mrs. Demargeon was supposed to be watching for him as well. Damn them all to hell, he breathed.\\n\\n The light began to fade. As evening crept across Bethany\u0027s Sin, Evan saw several cars drive slowly along McClain Terrace, heading toward the Circle. Across the street no lights showed in houses, but he knew they were still there, watching and waiting. There was a plastic-based table lighter on the floor, thrown from the overturned coffee table during the fight; Evan bent and picked it up, sat on the sofa, and clicked the dame on and off a couple of times. Fire reflected dully from the eyes of the corpse at his feet.\\n\\n Night fell.\\n\\n Bethany\u0027s Sin lay silent; but somewhere in the depths of the Demargeon house a clock ticked, ticked, ticked. Evan wiped his face with the back of his hand, wincing as droplets of sweat touched the raw scratches. Now he was alone, totally alone, and whatever happened in this place tonight depended solely on his own instincts, on his ability to slip quietly from shadow to shadow, on his will to survive. Tonight he must face the Hand of Evil, and there would never be any running again. His heart beat echoed the ticks of the clock.\\n\\n At twenty minutes after eight the phone rang. He tensed, stared at it as it rang again. Again. Again.\\n\\n Let them know. Yes. Let them know I\u0027m ready to fight them.\\n\\n The phone rang on.\\n\\n Evan stood up, crossed to the phone, and ripped it from the wall.\\n\\n And now it was time to go.\\n\\n He took the lighter down into the basement, used the remainder of a can of fluid to soak magazines and news papers and cast-off clothing in boxes, then dragged the boxes to a spot beneath the stairs. He broke the crippled chair into pieces and threw them onto the fluid-gleaming pile; there was enough fluid remaining in the second can to douse the stairs themselves. Then he clicked the flame on, touched it to the edge of a scrapped dress; the cloth smoked, sputtered, burst into tire. The newspapers and magazines caught quickly, pages curling and blackening; tendrils of fire snaked upward toward the stairs and bluish flame rippled across the wood. Evan waited until the pile of boxes had caught completely, the fire hot enough to make him step back a few paces, and he watched the steps begin to blacken; then the lowest step caught, and the dangling railing. Grayish, sour-smelling smoke swirled thickly around the basement. Evan put the lighter in his back pocket, picked up the two firebombs, and slipped through the basement door into the backyard.\\n\\n Ran for the fence and climbed over, cradling the two sloshing bottles in the crook of one arm. He glanced back, could see red light streaming through the door panes, and then he was running along the ditch in the darkness, planning to circle the perimeter of the village until he reached the clinic. Overhead, the near-perfect orb of the moon bathed him in hot, lunatic light. He ran on, keeping his body low, looking from side to side for any trace of movement; to his right lay the backs of houses, to his left the solid darkness of the forest.\\n\\n And in another moment there came a terrible, high pitched shriek, and three Amazons on horseback burst toward him from that darkness, axes swinging. This time he knew they would kill him, for he recognized the death look in their eyes.\\n\\n Evan reached for the lighter, flicked it on, touched that yellow flame to one of the fluid-sopped fuses. He took no time to aim, but threw the bottle into their midst. When the bottle hit, there was a brief, white-startling ball of fire and the horses screamed, rearing.\\n\\n Two of them collided and went down, and the third spun in a fearful circle as the fire leaped along bone-dry brush and tangles of thicket.\\n\\n And then Evan was past them and gone, his legs churning. He looked back for an instant, saw a patch of woodland trembling with flame and the dark horse-shapes caught in it. Then he didn\u0027t look back anymore. He ran on, knowing he was still on the perimeter of Bethany\u0027s Sin but not exactly certain how far away the clinic was.\\n\\n From the abyss of the forest he thought he heard more shrieks, closing in, and he kept one hand firm around the remaining bomb.\\n\\n Shadows leaped at him; the night was a mad house of moonlight and darkness, fighting each other and the man who struggled through them. He tripped, almost fell, kept running; if that bottle should break, his last weapon would be gone.\\n\\n And then, his chest heaving and his lungs burning for oxygen, Evan abruptly stopped. Peered into the blackness ahead. Listened.\\n\\n What was that sound? What was that terrible, hellish sound?\\n\\n Hoofbeats. Four or five horses. Coming along the ditch toward him.\\n\\n And before Evan could leap for the fence, they were upon him: four Amazons with hate-twisted faces, axes shimmering with moonlight and the eerie, pulsating power of the things that gripped them. The red-eyed horses rumbled like world-splitting earthquakes.\\n\\n Shrieks from five raging throats tore at him, and even as he was stepping back he was touching the flame to his last fuse; it sputtered, leaped. He reared back and threw the bottle among them; it glanced off an elbow, off a shoulder, leaving ripples of flames, finally exploded like a hand-grenade blast. Fire and glass shards pierced the air, into the hair and eyes of the woman-things. One of them screamed wildly, began chopping the air while her eyes caught fire; another ripped at her flaming gown; a third clutched to a rearing horse with a burning mane. Evan turned away, leaped for the fence and caught his fingers in it, pulled himself up. An ax slammed the mesh beside him. Evan pushed against the top of the fence, landed in grass, ran through a backyard toward the street, his nerves screaming.\\n\\n When he reached the street he saw it was Fredonia; he\u0027d completely circled Bethany\u0027s Sin, gone past the clinic. In the distance he could hear the pain-screams of the horses, and toward McClain Terrace the sky was beginning to redden very slightly. He knew they\u0027d have found the fire, and would be trying to put it out.\\n\\n He stood where he was for a moment, trying to get his bearings; he\u0027d have to go through the village to get to the clinic, and they would be waiting there for him. Evan looked around: there was the Gulf station, a few silent houses, the road leading out of Bethany\u0027s Sin toward safety, and...\\n\\n ...something lying across that road.\\n\\n Lights came on. Evan was caught between them, like a moth frozen by double flames. He squinted, tried to see beyond those lights. Realized they were headlights. A car had blocked the road.\\n\\n \"Mr. Reid,\" someone said. A man\u0027s voice. \"Mr. Reid, I think you\u0027d best step on over here now. Come on. And be real careful how you move.\" A figure stepped out of the car, walked forward so it was framed against the headlights. Sheriff Wysinger, holding a gun loosely at his side. \"Come on, now,\" he said, as if coaxing a little boy out from his hiding place. \"There\u0027s no use in running. You ought to know that by now, Mr. Reid.\"\\n\\n Evan didn\u0027t move. \"I\u0027m going to find my wife and child,\" he said, his mouth bitter-dry.\\n\\n \"Oh, no, you\u0027re not. That\u0027s not what they want. Your wife\u0027s one of them now, Mr. Reid, or she soon will be. You can\u0027t fight them. Nobody can.\"\\n\\n \"I can fight them!\" Evan shouted, trembling; his voice echoed along the street. \"For God\u0027s sake help me!\"\\n\\n \"God\u0027s no good in this place,\" Wysinger said quietly. \"At least, not the God you and I pray to.\" He smiled like a lizard. \"Used to pray to. No. Even God stays out of Bethany\u0027s Sin.\"\\n\\n \"You and I can fight them together!\" Evan said desperately.\\n\\n Wysinger shook his head, brought the gun up, and pointed it at Evan. \"I\u0027m too old, and I\u0027m too weak. You\u0027re just a fool. And mister, my little niche in Hell is all carved out for me and waiting, and I\u0027m in no hurry to get there.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong with you?\" Evan raged. \"You\u0027re the sheriff here, and you\u0027re sitting in a nest of murderesses!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m alive because they need me,\" Wysinger said, his eyes glittering over the gun barrel. \"If they didn\u0027t need me, I\u0027d be out in that place by now, my bones rotting with all the rest: It\u0027s a matter of survival, Mr. Reid; either you do or you don\u0027t. Now step on over here, and hurry up about it.\" He motioned with the gun.\\n\\n Evan, his mind racing, walked slowly toward the man.\\n\\n Wysinger suddenly cocked his head to the side; Evan had caught the smell of fire in a stale, sluggish breeze, and he knew the other man had smelled it too. Wysinger\u0027s eyes widened; he\u0027d seen the faint red smear in the distance, over on McClain, and the brighter burst of light where the forest had caught fire. \"You...set a...fire...\" Wysinger whispered incredulously. His face reddened with fury. \"You son of a bitch! You crazy son of a bitch!\" He reached out, gripped the remnants of Evan\u0027s shirt and wrenched him forward, holding the gun up under his throat. \"I ought to blast your fucking head of right here and now! That forest\u0027ll burn like dry tinder!\" He shook Evan mindlessly. \"Do you know what you\u0027ve done? Do you know...?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Evan said. \"I know.\" He locked eyes with the man. \"You don\u0027t have the equipment to battle a blaze like that. Neely Ames told me so. When they can see the fire from Spangler or Barnesboro, they\u0027ll send their trucks to help you. And then they\u0027ll find you, and me, and...those women.\"\\n\\n \"Goddamn you!\" Wysinger breathed, his teeth gritting. His eyes slid over toward the forest. Sparks were spinning toward the sky, flaring out across the sunbaked woods and setting new fires. He shoved Evan toward the police car. \"Get in there!\" he roared, fear cracking his voice. \"Hurry!\"\\n\\n Evan slid across the seat. Wysinger, his face drawn and sweat-beaded, climbed beneath the wheel, keeping the gun aimed into Evan\u0027s side; he started the engine. \"I\u0027ll kill you if you move,\" he said fiercely. \"I swear I\u0027ll kill you.\"\\n\\n \"Where are you taking me?\"\\n\\n \"To them. To that...temple.\" He put the car into gear with his free hand. \"They\u0027ll know what to do about that goddamned fire.\" He gritted his teeth. \"And they\u0027ll know what to do about you!\" He put his foot to the floor, and the car leaped forward.\\n\\n Evan spun, gripped the man\u0027s bearish wrist, jerked it upward; the gun cracked and cracked again; glass shattered; Wysinger lost his grip on the wheel, reached for Evan\u0027s throat, and Evan, clinging to the gun hand, threw his weight against the slipping wheel. The tires screamed into the night, banshee wails, and the car rocketed across the street toward the gas station. Too late, Wysinger realized what was about to happen; he cursed, tried to get control of the car again, but in a fraction of a second Evan had slammed his own foot down atop Wysinger\u0027s, forcing the accelerator to the floorboard.\\n\\n The police car struck the gasoline pumps with a rending shriek of metal against metal; the pump housings shattered, were thrown to each side by the passage of the car, and then the car was going forward, forward, smashing through the glass front of the main office, where Evan had sat talking with Jess the manager. Evan was jerked forward and then backward, forward again, striking his forehead on the dashboard, striking his shoulder against the door; he caught a glimpse of Wysinger\u0027s sweating face, open mouthed, screaming. The car ground over a sea of glass and slammed heavily into a wooden counter, splitting it into two sections; the cash register spun away, crashed into a wall, and exploded. And then the car stopped, engine grinding grinding grinding.\\n\\n Through a red haze of pain Evan saw the first tongues of fire licking around the hood. He couldn\u0027t make himself move: pretty fire, he thought. Pretty red fire burn everything down. His shoulder throbbed, and he thought it must certainly be broken, but when he tried he could move all the fingers of that hand except his thumb.\\n\\n Pretty red fire, he thought, staring as it grew. Burn. Burn. Burn. After another moment he could turn his head.\\n\\n A livid blue bruise, blackening, covered one side of Wysinger\u0027s face; half of the steering wheel had been broken off and lay in the man\u0027s lap. He moaned softly but didn\u0027t move.\\n\\n The fire had bubbled paint on the hood. Evan watched the bubbles burst. And then he was moving again, slowly, painfully, trying to get out of the car. He pushed against the door and it ground open, and then he was falling out, onto his injured shoulder, and then crawling, crawling through glass and oil and flattened cans. He crawled out through the broken window, blood streaming from his shattered nose; crawled out across the gas station pavement; crawled, trailing blood, into the street, and lay there, unable to crawl anymore.\\n\\n There was a quiet whump! and then an explosion of glass and metal. A ragged scream that went on and on and on. Evan turned his head to look. Wysinger\u0027s gas tank had blown, and flames covered the car; as Evan watched he saw the swirling fires churn within the station office and then snake in long red tendrils toward the remnants of the shattered pumps, following the path of the rising fumes from the open tanks, disappearing into the ground.\\n\\n The explosion that followed cracked Evan\u0027s eardrums. Metal and glass and slabs of pavement burst high, and sheets of flaming gasoline sprayed out in a deadly mist. The station office and the police car disappeared in a column of white fire, and Evan saw what looked like a burning human body explode into minute pieces. He curled himself into a ball as the debris came down, striking all around him. The flaming gasoline spattered trees and rooftops and lawns, and the air was filled with the reeking stink of it, like a thick perfume or a wine that has turned to vinegar in the bottle.\\n\\n Just as Evan remembered where he was, he realized his shirt had almost been burned off him, and his hair and eyebrows were singed. He wiped his face, and the hand came away bloody. He lay against hot concrete, hearing the growing roar of Hades lapping at the shore of Themiscrya.\\n\\n The Rite of Fire and Iron. Oliviadre. The temple, Wysinger had said; that\u0027s where they are. The temple. All there for the rite. We\u0027re having a party. And everyone\u0027s invited. Even you, Mr. Reid. Oh, yes.\\n\\n Especially you. Come on, now. We\u0027re waiting for you. Come on. You don\u0027t want to be late, now, do you?\\n\\n \"No,\" Evan said between cracked lips. \"No.\" He heaved himself up, stood on unsteady legs, staggered. We\u0027re waiting. All of us. Your wife, too. Your wife, Oliviadre, she of the burning eyes and wicked grin. Standing amid the heat and the smoke and the far-scattered flames, Evan could see the museum through distant treetops. It was blazing, too, but blazing with light-the only house in Bethany\u0027s Sin that looked alive tonight. Alive and waiting for him; he thought for a fleeting instant that those windows did indeed look like blank, cold eyes, the eyes of a statue, perhaps, or of an all-sleeping spiderish monstrosity that sat in the center of Bethany\u0027s Sin waiting for its next offering of flesh.\\n\\n Evan summoned his last reserves of strength. I\u0027m okay, he told himself. I can make it. I can. I can make it because if I don\u0027t they will have won. I can. Yes. They will have won and the Hand of Evil will have my wife and child. I\u0027m okay. I can. I can.\\n\\n Something within him laughed long and loud, the laugh becoming hysterical and twisted. We\u0027re waiting. Come on. Come on to the paaaaaarrrrrttttttyyyyyyy.\\n\\n The eyes of that house sought him, beckoning him on. And Evan staggered forward, through the streets of fire. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bethany-s-sin/page-29.html","bookId":2472,"book":{"id":2472,"title":"Bethany\u0027s Sin","description":"Storyline: Set in a village in which the women get caught up in occult rituals and wholesale slaughter perpetuated in the name of the Amazon women, the goddess of the cult being incarnated in the form of the town\u0027s female mayor.
