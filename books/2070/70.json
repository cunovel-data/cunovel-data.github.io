{"id":111572,"no":70,"title":"Page 70","content":"Jon The mare whickered softly as Jon Snow tightened the cinch. \"Easy, sweet lady,\" he said in a soft voice, quieting her with a touch. Wind whispered through the stable, a cold dead breath on his face, but Jon paid it no mind. He strapped his roll to the saddle, his scarred fingers stiff and clumsy. \"Ghost,\" he called softly, \"to me.\" And the wolf was there, eyes like embers. \"Jon, please. You must not do this.\" He mounted, the reins in his hand, and wheeled the horse around to face the night. Samwell Tarly stood in the stable door, a full moon peering over his shoulder. He threw a giant\u0027s shadow, immense and black. \"Get out of my way, Sam.\" \"Jon, you can\u0027t,\" Sam said. \"I won\u0027t let you.\" \"I would sooner not hurt you,\" Jon told him. \"Move aside, Sam, or I\u0027ll ride you down.\" \"You won\u0027t. You have to listen to me. Please . . . \" Jon put his spurs to horseflesh, and the mare bolted for the door. For an instant Sam stood his ground, his face as round and pale as the moon behind him, his mouth a widening O of surprise. At the last moment, when they were almost on him, he jumped aside as Jon had known he would, stumbled, and fell. The mare leapt over him, out into the night. Jon raised the hood of his heavy cloak and gave the horse her head. Castle Black was silent and still as he rode out, with Ghost racing at his side. Men watched from the Wall behind him, he knew, but their eyes were turned north, not south. No one would see him go, no one but Sam Tarly, struggling back to his feet in the dust of the old stables. He hoped Sam hadn\u0027t hurt himself, falling like that. He was so heavy and so ungainly, it would be just like him to break a wrist or twist his ankle getting out of the way. \"I warned him,\" Jon said aloud. \"It was nothing to do with him, anyway.\" He flexed his burned hand as he rode, opening and closing the scarred fingers. They still pained him, but it felt good to have the wrappings off. Moonlight silvered the hills as he followed the twisting ribbon of the kingsroad. He needed to get as far from the Wall as he could before they realized he was gone. On the morrow he would leave the road and strike out overland through field and bush and stream to throw off pursuit, but for the moment speed was more important than deception. It was not as though they would not guess where he was going. The Old Bear was accustomed to rise at first light, so Jon had until dawn to put as many leagues as he could between him and the Wall . . . if Sam Tarly did not betray him. The fat boy was dutiful and easily frightened, but he loved Jon like a brother. If questioned, Sam would doubtless tell them the truth, but Jon could not imagine him braving the guards in front of the King\u0027s Tower to wake Mormont from sleep. When Jon did not appear to fetch the Old Bear\u0027s breakfast from the kitchen, they\u0027d look in his cell and find Longclaw on the bed. It had been hard to abandon it, but Jon was not so lost to honor as to take it with him. Even Jorah Mormont had not done that, when he fled in disgrace. Doubtless Lord Mormont would find someone more worthy of the blade. Jon felt bad when he thought of the old man. He knew his desertion would be salt in the still-raw wound of his son\u0027s disgrace. That seemed a poor way to repay him for his trust, but it couldn\u0027t be helped. No matter what he did, Jon felt as though he were betraying someone. Even now, he did not know if he was doing the honorable thing. The southron had it easier. They had their septons to talk to, someone to tell them the gods\u0027 will and help sort out right from wrong. But the Starks worshiped the old gods, the nameless gods, and if the heart trees heard, they did not speak. When the last lights of Castle Black vanished behind him, Jon slowed his mare to a walk. He had a long journey ahead and only the one horse to see him through. There were holdfasts and farming villages along the road south where he might be able to trade the mare for a fresh mount when he needed one, but not if she were injured or blown. He would need to find new clothes soon; most like, he\u0027d need to steal them. He was clad in black from head to heel; high leather riding boots, roughspun breeches and tunic, sleeveless leather jerkin, and heavy wool cloak. His longsword and dagger were sheathed in black moleskin, and the hauberk and coif in his saddlebag were black ringmail. Any bit of it could mean his death if he were taken. A stranger wearing black was viewed with cold suspicion in every village and holdfast north of the Neck, and men would soon be watching for him. Once Maester Aemon\u0027s ravens took flight, Jon knew he would find no safe haven. Not even at Winterfell. Bran might want to let him in, but Maester Luwin had better sense. He would bar the gates and send Jon away, as he should. Better not to call there at all. Yet he saw the castle clear in his mind\u0027s eye, as if he had left it only yesterday; the towering granite walls, the Great Hall with its smells of smoke and dog and roasting meat, his father\u0027s solar, the turret room where he had slept. Part of him wanted nothing so much as to hear Bran laugh again, to sup on one of Gage\u0027s beef-and-bacon pies, to listen to Old Nan tell her tales of the children of the forest and Florian the Fool. But he had not left the Wall for that; he had left because he was after all his father\u0027s son, and Robb\u0027s brother. The gift of a sword, even a sword as fine as Longclaw, did not make him a Mormont. Nor was he Aemon Targaryen. Three times the old man had chosen, and three times he had chosen honor, but that was him. Even now, Jon could not decide whether the maester had stayed because he was weak and craven, or because he was strong and true. Yet he understood what the old man had meant, about the pain of choosing; he understood that all too well. Tyrion Lannister had claimed that most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it, but Jon was done with denials. He was who he was; Jon Snow, bastard and oathbreaker, motherless, friendless, and damned. For the rest of his life—however long that might be—he would be condemned to be an outsider, the silent man standing in the shadows who dares not speak his true name. Wherever he might go throughout the Seven Kingdoms, he would need to live a lie, lest every man\u0027s hand be raised against him. But it made no matter, so long as he lived long enough to take his place by his brother\u0027s side and help avenge his father. He remembered Robb as he had last seen him, standing in the yard with snow melting in his auburn hair. Jon would have to come to him in secret, disguised. He tried to imagine the look on Robb\u0027s face when he revealed himself. His brother would shake his head and smile, and he\u0027d say . . . he\u0027d say . . . He could not see the smile. Hard as he tried, he could not see it. He found himself thinking of the deserter his father had beheaded the day they\u0027d found the direwolves. \"You said the words,\" Lord Eddard had told him. \"You took a vow, before your brothers, before the old gods and the new.\" Desmond and Fat Tom had dragged the man to the stump. Bran\u0027s eyes had been wide as saucers, and Jon had to remind him to keep his pony in hand. He remembered the look on Father\u0027s face when Theon Greyjoy brought forth Ice, the spray of blood on the snow, the way Theon had kicked the head when it came rolling at his feet. He wondered what Lord Eddard might have done if the deserter had been his brother Benjen instead of that ragged stranger. Would it have been any different? It must, surely, surely . . . and Robb would welcome him, for a certainty. He had to, or else . . . It did not bear thinking about. Pain throbbed, deep in his fingers, as he clutched the reins. Jon put his heels into his horse and broke into a gallop, racing down the kingsroad, as if to outrun his doubts. Jon was not afraid of death, but he did not want to die like that, trussed and bound and beheaded like a common brigand. If he must perish, let it be with a sword in his hand, fighting his father\u0027s killers. He was no true Stark, had never been one . . . but he could die like one. Let them say that Eddard Stark had fathered four sons, not three. Ghost kept pace with them for almost half a mile, red tongue lolling from his mouth. Man and horse alike lowered their heads as he asked the mare for more speed. The wolf slowed, stopped, watching, his eyes glowing red in the moonlight. He vanished behind, but Jon knew he would follow, at his own pace. Scattered lights flickered through the trees ahead of him, on both sides of the road: Mole\u0027s Town. A dog barked as he rode through, and he heard a mule\u0027s raucous haw from the stable, but otherwise the village was still. Here and there the glow of hearth fires shone through shuttered windows, leaking between wooden slats, but only a few. Mole\u0027s Town was bigger than it seemed, but three quarters of it was under the ground, in deep warm cellars connected by a maze of tunnels. Even the whorehouse was down there, nothing on the surface but a wooden shack no bigger than a privy, with a red lantern hung over the door. On the Wall, he\u0027d heard men call the whores \"buried treasures.\" He wondered whether any of his brothers in black were down there tonight, mining. That was oathbreaking too, yet no one seemed to care. Not until he was well beyond the village did Jon slow again. By then both he and the mare were damp with sweat. He dismounted, shivering, his burned hand aching. A bank of melting snow lay under the trees, bright in the moonlight, water trickling off to form small shallow pools. Jon squatted and brought his hands together, cupping the runoff between his fingers. The snowmelt was icy cold. He drank, and splashed some on his face, until his cheeks tingled. His fingers were throbbing worse than they had in days, and his head was pounding too. I am doing the right thing, he told himself, so why do I feel so bad? The horse was well lathered, so Jon took the lead and walked her for a while. The road was scarcely wide enough for two riders to pass abreast, its surface cut by tiny streams and littered with stone. That run had been truly stupid, an invitation to a broken neck. Jon wondered what had gotten into him. Was he in such a great rush to die? Off in the trees, the distant scream of some frightened animal made him look up. His mare whinnied nervously. Had his wolf found some prey? He cupped his hands around his mouth. \"Ghost!\" he shouted. \"Ghost, to me.\" The only answer was a rush of wings behind him as an owl took flight. Frowning, Jon continued on his way. He led the mare for half an hour, until she was dry. Ghost did not appear. Jon wanted to mount up and ride again, but he was concerned about his missing wolf. \"Ghost,\" he called again. \"Where are you? To me! Ghost!\" Nothing in these woods could trouble a direwolf, even a half-grown direwolf, unless . . . no, Ghost was too smart to attack a bear, and if there was a wolf pack anywhere close Jon would have surely heard them howling. He should eat, he decided. Food would settle his stomach and give Ghost the chance to catch up. There was no danger yet; Castle Black still slept. In his saddlebag, he found a biscuit, a piece of cheese, and a small withered brown apple. He\u0027d brought salt beef as well, and a rasher of bacon he\u0027d filched from the kitchens, but he would save the meat for the morrow. After it was gone he\u0027d need to hunt, and that would slow him. Jon sat under the trees and ate his biscuit and cheese while his mare grazed along the kingsroad. He kept the apple for last. It had gone a little soft, but the flesh was still tart and juicy. He was down to the core when he heard the sounds: horses, and from the north. Quickly Jon leapt up and strode to his mare. Could he outrun them? No, they were too close, they\u0027d hear him for a certainty, and if they were from Castle Black . . . He led the mare off the road, behind a thick stand of grey-green sentinels. \"Ouiet now,\" he said in a hushed voice, crouching down to peer through the branches. If the gods were kind, the riders would pass by. Likely as not, they were only smallfolk from Mole\u0027s Town, farmers on their way to their fields, although what they were doing out in the middle of the night . . . He listened to the sound of hooves growing steadily louder as they trotted briskly down the kingsroad. From the sound, there were five or six of them at the least. Their voices drifted through the trees. \" . . . certain he came this way?\" \"We can\u0027t be certain.\" \"He could have ridden east, for all you know. Or left the road to cut through the woods. That\u0027s what I\u0027d do.\" \"In the dark? Stupid. If you didn\u0027t fall off your horse and break your neck, you\u0027d get lost and wind up back at the Wall when the sun came up.\" \"I would not.\" Grenn sounded peeved. \"I\u0027d just ride south, you can tell south by the stars.\" \"What if the sky was cloudy?\" Pyp asked. \"Then I wouldn\u0027t go.\" Another voice broke in. \"You know where I\u0027d be if it was me? I\u0027d be in Mole\u0027s Town, digging for buried treasure.\" Toad\u0027s shrill laughter boomed through the trees. Jon\u0027s mare snorted. \"Keep quiet, all of you,\" Haider said. \"I thought I heard something.\" \"Where? I didn\u0027t hear anything.\" The horses stopped. \"You can\u0027t hear yourself fart.\" \"I can too,\" Grenn insisted. \"Quiet!\" They all fell silent, listening. Jon found himself holding his breath. Sam, he thought. He hadn\u0027t gone to the Old Bear, but he hadn\u0027t gone to bed either, he\u0027d woken the other boys. Damn them all. Come dawn, if they were not in their beds, they\u0027d be named deserters too. What did they think they were doing? The hushed silence seemed to stretch on and on. From where Jon crouched, he could see the legs of their horses through the branches. Finally Pyp spoke up. \"What did you hear?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Haider admitted. \"A sound, I thought it might have been a horse but . . . \" \"There\u0027s nothing here.\" Out of the corner of his eye, Jon glimpsed a pale shape moving through the trees. Leaves rustled, and Ghost came bounding out of the shadows, so suddenly that Jon\u0027s mare started and gave a whinny. \"There!\" Halder shouted. \"I heard it too!\" \"Traitor,\" Jon told the direwolf as he swung up into the saddle. He turned the mare\u0027s head to slide off through the trees, but they were on him before he had gone ten feet. \"Jon!\" Pyp shouted after him. \"Pull up,\" Grenn said. \"You can\u0027t outrun us all.\" Jon wheeled around to face them, drawing his sword. \"Get back. I don\u0027t wish to hurt you, but I will if I have to.\" \"One against seven?\" Halder gave a signal. The boys spread out, surrounding him. \"What do you want with me?\" Jon demanded. \"We want to take you back where you belong,\" Pyp said. \"I belong with my brother.\" \"We\u0027re your brothers now,\" Grenn said. \"They\u0027ll cut off your head if they catch you, you know,\" Toad put in with a nervous laugh. \"This is so stupid, it\u0027s like something the Aurochs would do.\" \"I would not,\" Grenn said. \"I\u0027m no oathbreaker. I said the words and I meant them.\" \"So did I,\" Jon told them. \"Don\u0027t you understand? They murdered my father. It\u0027s war, my brother Robb is fighting in the riverlands—\" \"We know,\" said Pyp solemnly. \"Sam told us everything.\" \"We\u0027re sorry about your father,\" Grenn said, \"but it doesn\u0027t matter. Once you say the words, you can\u0027t leave, no matter what.\" \"I have to,\" Jon said fervently. \"You said the words,\" Pyp reminded him. \"Now my watch begins, you said it. It shall not end until my death.\" \"I shall live and die at my post,\" Grenn added, nodding. \"You don\u0027t have to tell me the words, I know them as well as you do.\" He was angry now. Why couldn\u0027t they let him go in peace? They were only making it harder. \"I am the sword in the darkness,\" Halder intoned. \"The watcher on the walls,\" piped Toad. Jon cursed them all to their faces. They took no notice. Pyp spurred his horse closer, reciting, \"I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men.\" \"Stay back,\" Jon warned him, brandishing his sword. \"I mean it, Pyp.\" They weren\u0027t even wearing armor, he could cut them to pieces if he had to. Matthar had circled behind him. He joined the chorus. \"I pledge my life and honor to the Night\u0027s Watch.\" Jon kicked his mare, spinning her in a circle. The boys were all around him now, closing from every side. \"For this night . . . \" Halder trotted in from the left. \" . . . and all the nights to come,\" finished Pyp. He reached over for Jon\u0027s reins. \"So here are your choices. Kill me, or come back with me.\" Jon lifted his sword . . . and lowered it, helpless. \"Damn you,\" he said. \"Damn you all.\" \"Do we have to bind your hands, or will you give us your word you\u0027ll ride back peaceful?\" asked Halder. \"I won\u0027t run, if that\u0027s what you mean.\" Ghost moved out from under the trees and Jon glared at him. \"Small help you were,\" he said. The deep red eyes looked at him knowingly. \"We had best hurry,\" Pyp said. \"If we\u0027re not back before first light, the Old Bear will have all our heads.\" Of the ride back, Jon Snow remembered little. It seemed shorter than the journey south, perhaps because his mind was elsewhere. Pyp set the pace, galloping, walking, trotting, and then breaking into another gallop. Mole\u0027s Town came and went, the red lantern over the brothel long extinguished. They made good time. Dawn was still an hour off when Jon glimpsed the towers of Castle Black ahead of them, dark against the pale immensity of the Wall. It did not seem like home this time. They could take him back, Jon told himself, but they could not make him stay. The war would not end on the morrow, or the day after, and his friends could not watch him day and night. He would bide his time, make them think he was content to remain here . . . and then, when they had grown lax, he would be off again. Next time he would avoid the kingsroad. He could follow the Wall east, perhaps all the way to the sea, a longer route but a safer one. Or even west, to the mountains, and then south over the high passes. That was the wildling\u0027s way, hard and perilous, but at least no one wouid follow him. He wouldn\u0027t stray within a hundred leagues of Winterfell or the kingsroad. Samwell Tarly awaited them in the old stables, slumped on the ground against a bale of hay, too anxious to sleep. He rose and brushed himself off. \"I . . . I\u0027m glad they found you, Jon.\" \"I\u0027m not,\" Jon said, dismounting. Pyp hopped off his horse and looked at the lightening sky with disgust. \"Give us a hand bedding down the horses, Sam,\" the small boy said. \"We have a long day before us, and no sleep to face it on, thanks to Lord Snow.\" When day broke, Jon walked to the kitchens as he did every dawn. Three-Finger Hobb said nothing as he gave him the Old Bear\u0027s breakfast. Today it was three brown eggs boiled hard, with fried bread and ham steak and a bowl of wrinkled plums. Jon carried the food back to the King\u0027s Tower. He found Mormont at the window seat, writing. His raven was walking back and forth across his shoulders, muttering, \"Corn, corn, corn.\" The bird shrieked when Jon entered. \"Put the food on the table,\" the Old Bear said, glancing up. \"I\u0027ll have some beer.\" Jon opened a shuttered window, took the flagon of beer off the outside ledge, and filled a horn. Hobb had given him a lemon, still cold from the Wall. Jon crushed it in his fist. The juice trickled through his fingers. Mormont drank lemon in his beer every day, and claimed that was why he still had his own teeth. \"Doubtless you loved your father,\" Mormont said when Jon brought him his horn. \"The things we love destroy us every time, lad. Remember when I told you that?\" \"I remember,\" Jon said sullenly. He did not care to talk of his father\u0027s death, not even to Mormont. \"See that you never forget it. The hard truths are the ones to hold tight. Fetch me my plate. Is it ham again? So be it. You look weary. Was your moonlight ride so tiring?\" Jon\u0027s throat was dry. \"You know?\" \"Know,\" the raven echoed from Mormont\u0027s shoulder. \"Know.\" The Old Bear snorted. \"Do you think they chose me Lord Commander of the Night\u0027s Watch because I\u0027m dumb as a stump, Snow? Aemon told me you\u0027d go. I told him you\u0027d be back. I know my men . . . and my boys too. Honor set you on the kingsroad . . . and honor brought you back.\" \"My friends brought me back,\" Jon said. \"Did I say it was your honor?\" Mormont inspected his plate. \"They killed my father. Did you expect me to do nothing?\" \"If truth be told, we expected you to do just as you did.\" Mormont tried a plum, spit out the pit. \"I ordered a watch kept over you., You were seen leaving. If your brothers had not fetched you back, you would have been taken along the way, and not by friends. Unless you have a horse with wings like a raven. Do you?\" \"No.\" Jon felt like a fool. \"Pity, we could use a horse like that.\" Jon stood tall. He told himself that he would die well; that much he could do, at the least. \"I know the penalty for desertion, my lord. I\u0027m not afraid to die.\" \"Die!\" the raven cried. \"Nor live, I hope,\" Mormont said, cutting his ham with a dagger and feeding a bite to the bird. \"You have not deserted—yet. Here you stand. If we beheaded every boy who rode to Mole\u0027s Town in the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall. Yet maybe you mean to flee again on the morrow, or a fortnight from now. Is that it? Is that your hope, boy?\" Jon kept silent. \"I thought so.\" Mormont peeled the shell off a boiled egg. \"Your father is dead, lad. Do you think you can bring him back?\" \"No,\" he answered, sullen. \"Good,\" Mormont said. \"We\u0027ve seen the dead come back, you and me, and it\u0027s not something I care to see again.\" He ate the egg in two bites and flicked a bit of shell out from between his teeth. \"Your brother is in the field with all the power of the north behind him. Any one of his lords bannermen commands more swords than you\u0027ll find in all the Night\u0027s Watch. Why do you imagine that they need your help? Are you such a mighty warrior, or do you carry a grumkin in your pocket to magic up your sword?\" Jon had no answer for him. The raven was pecking at an egg, breaking the shell. Pushing his beak through the hole, he pulled out morsels of white and yoke. The Old Bear sighed. \"You are not the only one touched by this war. Like as not, my sister is marching in your brother\u0027s host, her and those daughters of hers, dressed in men\u0027s mail. Maege is a hoary old snark, stubborn, short-tempered, and willful. Truth be told, I can hardly stand to be around the wretched woman, but that does not mean my love for her is any less than the love you bear your half sisters.\" Frowning, Mormont took his last egg and squeezed it in his fist until the shell crunched. \"Or perhaps it does. Be that as it may, I\u0027d still grieve if she were slain, yet you don\u0027t see me running off. I said the words, just as you did. My place is here . . . where is yours, boy?\" I have no place, Jon wanted to say, I\u0027m a bastard, I have no rights, no name, no mother, and now not even a father. The words would not come. \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"I do,\" said Lord Commander Mormont. \"The cold winds are rising, Snow. Beyond the Wall, the shadows lengthen. Cotter Pyke writes of vast herds of elk, streaming south and east toward the sea, and mammoths as well. He says one of his men discovered huge, misshapen footprints not three leagues from Eastwatch. Rangers from the Shadow Tower have found whole villages abandoned, and at night Ser Denys says they see fires in the mountains, huge blazes that burn from dusk till dawn. Quorin Halfhand took a captive in the depths of the Gorge, and the man swears that Mance Rayder is massing all his people in some new, secret stronghold he\u0027s found, to what end the gods only know. Do you think your uncle Benjen was the only ranger we\u0027ve lost this past year?\" \"Ben Jen,\" the raven squawked, bobbing its head, bits of egg dribbling from its beak. \"Ben Jen. Ben Jen.\" \"No,\" Jon said. There had been others. Too many. \"Do you think your brother\u0027s war is more important than ours?\" the old man barked. Jon chewed his lip. The raven flapped its wings at him. \"War, war, war, war,\" it sang. \"It\u0027s not,\" Mormont told him. \"Gods save us, boy, you\u0027re not blind and you\u0027re not stupid. When dead men come hunting in the night, do you think it matters who sits the Iron Throne?\" \"No.\" Jon had not thought of it that way. \"Your lord father sent you to us, Jon. Why, who can say?\" \"Why? Why? Why?\" the raven called. \"All I know is that the blood of the First Men flows in the veins of the Starks. The First Men built the Wall, and it\u0027s said they remember things otherwise forgotten. And that beast of yours . . . he led us to the wights, warned you of the dead man on the steps. Ser Jaremy would doubtless call that happenstance, yet Ser Jaremy is dead and I\u0027m not.\" Lord Mormont stabbed a chunk of ham with the point of his dagger. \"I think you were meant to be here, and I want you and that wolf of yours with us when we go beyond the Wall.\" His words sent a chill of excitement down Jon\u0027s back. \"Beyond the Wall?\" \"You heard me. I mean to find Ben Stark, alive or dead.\" He chewed and swallowed. \"I will not sit here meekly and wait for the snows and the ice winds. We must know what is happening. This time the Night\u0027s Watch will ride in force, against the King-beyond-the-Wall, the Others, and anything else that may be out there. I mean to command them myself.\" He pointed his dagger at Jon\u0027s chest. \"By custom, the Lord Commander\u0027s steward is his squire as well . . . but I do not care to wake every dawn wondering if you\u0027ve run off again. So I will have an answer from you, Lord Snow, and I will have it now. Are you a brother of the Night\u0027s Watch . . . or only a bastard boy who wants to play at war?\" Jon Snow straightened himself and took a long deep breath. Forgive me, Father. Robb, Arya, Bran . . . forgive me, I cannot help you. He has the truth of it. This is my place. \"I am . . . yours, my lord. Your man. I swear it. I will not run again.\" The Old Bear snorted. \"Good. Now go put on your sword.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-game-of-thrones-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-1/page-70.html","bookId":2070,"book":{"id":2070,"title":"A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire #1)","description":"Storyline: A Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire #1) Summers span decades.
