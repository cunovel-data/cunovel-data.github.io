And the struggle for the Iron Throne has begun. \n As Warden of the north, Lord Eddard Stark counts it a curse when King Robert bestows on him the office of the Hand. His honour weighs him down at court where a true man does what he will, not what he must ... and a dead enemy is a thing of beauty. \n The old gods have no power in the south, Starkâ€™s family is split and there is treachery at court. Worse, the vengeance-mad heir of the deposed Dragon King has grown to maturity in exile in the Free Cities. He claims the Iron Throne.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-game-of-thrones-a-song-of-ice-and-fire-1.jpg","author":"George R.R.
