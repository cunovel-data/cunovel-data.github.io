{"id":10622,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 11: A Fight In The Vosges.","content":"Upon Colonel Tempe\u0027s rejoining the men--who were already busy preparing their suppers--he ordered the assembly to be sounded and, when they were formed up, he formally thanked them, in the name of the general, for the service that they had rendered; adding that they would appear in general orders, upon the following day. The men replied with a cheer of \"Vive la France!\" Their commander then informed them that he, himself, had received a step in rank and would, in future, command them with several other corps; that Lieutenant Ribouville would, in future, be their special commander, with the rank of captain; that the other two lieutenants would be promoted; and that three of their number would receive commissions and, while one of them remained under Captain Ribouville, the others would--with the newly-made captains--be attached to other corps. The two Barclays would receive commissions as officers, on the staff of General Cambriels, himself. When Colonel Tempe finished speaking, the boys could hardly believe their ears; and looked at each other, to inquire if they heard aright. There could be no mistake about it; for Colonel Tempe called them forward and, shaking hands with them, congratulated them on the promotion which, he said, they had well earned. The men gave a hearty cheer; for the young English lads were general favorites, for their good temper and willingness to oblige. Directly the men were dismissed, the colonel again called the lads to him. \"I am sorry to lose you,\" he said, \"but of course it is for your good. Come with me, at once, to General Cambriels. I will introduce you, and you had better ask for four days\u0027 leave. You can get the railway in four hours\u0027 ride from here. You will have no difficulty in finding a place in some of the commissariat cities going to fetch stores. If you start tonight, you can catch a train before morning, and be in Dijon quite early. A couple of days will be sufficient to get your uniforms made, and to buy horses. \"Your cousin will go with you. I gave him leave, last night, to start upon our arrival here. He is not so strong as you are; and the surgeon says that he must have rest, and quiet. He is quite worn out. \"Now, pile your rifles--you will not want them any more--and come with me. I have said good night to the general, but he will excuse me.\" Still bewildered, the boys did as they were ordered. As they were piling their rifles, they heard a loud blubbering. Looking round, they saw Tim Doyle, weeping most copiously. \"What is the matter, Tim?\" \"Matter! Your honor, ain\u0027t yer going to lave us? What am I going to do, at all?\" The boys hurried away, without reply--for Colonel Tempe was waiting for them--and, on the way to headquarters, mentioned Tim\u0027s grief at parting with them. The general received the lads most kindly and, at once, granted them four days\u0027 leave to go to Dijon, to procure uniform. Colonel Tempe then said: \"You do not want orderlies, do you, general?\" \"I do, indeed,\" the general answered. \"I have about a dozen cavalry men, of different regiments, who form my escort and act as orderlies; but they are my entire force of cavalry.\" \"I have an Irishman in my corps, general, who only joined to be near these young fellows. He was brought up among horses; and you have only to put him in a hussar uniform, and he would make a capital orderly, and would act as servant to your new staff officers.\" \"By all means,\" the general said; \"send him over, in the morning. We will make a hussar of him, in half an hour; we have got a few uniforms in store.\" What a meeting that was, near Dijon! The boys, upon reaching the station, had found a train on the point of starting; and it was seven in the morning when they reached the town. The shops open early, in French country towns; and although their tailor had not as yet taken his shutters down, he was up and about, and willingly measured them for their new uniforms--promising that they should have them, without fail, the next afternoon. They then walked up to the cottage; and dropped in just as the party, there, were sitting down to breakfast. There was a loud exclamation from Captain Barclay, and a scream of delight from their mother, and Milly; and it was a good ten minutes before they were sitting round the table, talking coherently. It was but six weeks since they had left, but it seemed like years; and there was as much to tell, and to talk about, as if they had just returned, after an absence of half a lifetime, in India. \"How long have you got leave for?\" was one of the first questions. \"Only four days,\" Percy said. \"The corps has now joined the army of the Vosges, and will act regularly with it. A move forward will take place, in a few days, so that we could not ask for longer.\" \"Only four days!\" Mrs. Barclay and Milly repeated, aghast. \"It is not much, mamma,\" Ralph put in, \"but it is better than nothing. You see, you did not expect us at all.\" \"Quite so,\" Captain Barclay said, cheerfully. \"It is a clear gain, and we waste the time in regretting that it is not longer. It is a great delight to have you back again, even for a few hours. You both look wonderfully well, and fully a year older than when you left. Roughing it, and exposure, evidently suits you. \"Has Louis come back with you?\" \"Yes, papa, he has come back to stay, for some time. He is completely done up, and the surgeon has ordered rest and quiet, for a while. \"How is Philippe?\" \"He is getting on well; and will walk, the doctor hopes, in another fortnight, or three weeks; but I have not seen him for--although your uncle comes in, as usual, for a chat with me--Madame Duburg has never forgiven me for having, as she says, influenced him in allowing the boys to go; and of course, since this wound of Philippe\u0027s, she has been more angry than ever.\" The boys laughed. They understood their aunt\u0027s ways. \"Tim has not been hurt, I hope?\" Milly asked. \"Oh no; Tim is as well as ever, and the life and soul of the corps.\" As breakfast went on, the boys gradually related the changes that were taking place: Major Tempe\u0027s promotion to be colonel, and the fact that he was placed in command of several corps of franc tireurs, who were hereafter to act together. They said no word, however, about their own promotion; having agreed to keep that matter secret, until the uniforms were completed. They had also asked their cousin to say nothing about it, at home; as otherwise their uncle would have been sure to have come in to congratulate them, and the secret would have been at an end, at once. An hour later, Monsieur Duburg came in to see them. After the first talk, he said to Captain Barclay: \"The way in which your boys have stood the fatigue is a proof, in itself, how much the prosperity of a nation depends upon the training of its boys. England is strong because her boys are all accustomed, from their childhood, to active exercise and outdoor, violent games. In case of a war, like this which we are going through, almost every man could turn soldier, and go through the fatigues of a campaign; and what is more, could make light of--not to say enjoy--them. \"Here, upon the contrary, our young fellows do nothing and, in an emergency like the present, want both spirit and strength to make soldiers. Almost all the boys who went from here in Tempe\u0027s corps have returned, completely worn out. Even Louis is a wreck; although, thanks to the companionship of your boys, he has supported it better, and longer, than the majority of them. Had he began, as a child, to take pleasure in strong exercise; no doubt he could have stood it as well as Ralph and Percy, who look absolutely benefited by it. Unfortunately, I allowed my wife\u0027s silly objection to prevail; until the last three years, when I insisted that they should do as they liked. \"As I have said before, Barclay, I say again: I congratulate you on your boys. You have a right to be proud of them. I wish the race of young Frenchmen were only like them.\" Great indeed was the astonishment--upon the afternoon of the following day--when Ralph and Percy walked into the sitting room, dressed as staff officers; feeling a little awkward with their swords, but flushed with an honorable pleasure and pride--for their epaulets had been gained by no family interests, no private influence. They were worn as the reward of good service. Captain Barclay wrung the boys\u0027 hands, silently. Their mother cried with delight, and Milly danced round the boys like a small possessed one. \"It is not for the absolute rank itself, boys, that I am pleased,\" their father said, when they had related the whole circumstances; \"for you have no idea of remaining in the French service and, consequently, the rank will be of no use to you, after the end of the war. Still, it is a thing all your lives to be proud of--that you won your commission in the French army, by good service.\" \"What I am thinking of most,\" Mrs. Barclay said, \"is that, now they are officers in the regular army, they will run no risk of being shot, if they are taken prisoners.\" \"We don\u0027t mean to be taken prisoners, mamma. Still, as you say, it is certainly an advantage in favor of the regular uniform.\" \"And what is to become of Tim?\" Milly asked. \"Oh, Tim is going to become a hussar, and act as one of the general\u0027s orderlies; and be our servant, when he has nothing else to do. You see, now we are officers, we have a right to servants.\" \"I am very glad Tim is going with you,\" Mrs. Barclay said. \"My brother tells us that he saved Philippe\u0027s life, and it seems a comfort to know that he is with you.\" The next morning Captain Barclay went down with them to the town, and purchased a couple of capital horses which, by great good fortune, were on sale. Upon the morning of the fourth day of their visit, the boys took leave of their father and mother, and left to join the headquarters of General Cambriels. The parting was far less trying than it had been, the first time they went away. The boys were not, now, going out to an unknown danger. Although the risk that a staff officer runs is, absolutely, somewhat greater than that incurred by a regimental officer; still, it is slight in comparison with the risk run by a franc tireur, employed in harassing an enemy, and in cutting his communications--especially when capture means death. Those who remained behind were encouraged partly by this thought, but still more by the really irrational one that, as the boys had gone away and come back safe, once, they would probably do so again. The evening of the same day, the Barclays reported themselves for duty to the general and, next morning, began work. Their duty was hard, though simple. By day they were constantly on duty--that is to say, either riding over the country, or waiting near the general\u0027s quarters in readiness for a start or--more seldom--writing, and drawing up reports in the office. By night they took it in turns with the other staff officers to be on duty--that is to say, to lie down to sleep in uniform, with the horse saddled at the door, in readiness to start at an instant\u0027s notice. Tim\u0027s duties as an orderly were not heavy, and were generally over by five o\u0027clock; after which he acted as servant to the boys. It was impossible, under the circumstances, for the staff to mess together, as usual. There was neither a room available nor, indeed, any of the appliances. Among Tim\u0027s other duties, therefore, was that of cooking. They had also another orderly allotted to them, and he devoted himself to the care of the horses; Tim undertaking all other work. The boys liked their new duties much. The work was hard, but pleasant. Their fellow officers were pleasant companions, and their general most kind, and genial. A week after they had joined, General Cambriels advanced into the Vosges to oppose the Prussians, who were marching south. The progress of the army was slow, for they had to carry what supplies they required with them. Colonel Tempe kept, with his command, a few hours\u0027 march ahead; and one or other of the boys was frequently dispatched with orders, etc. to obtain reports from him. After three days\u0027 marching, they neared the enemy. All was now watchfulness, and excitement. The franc tireurs were already engaged in skirmishing and, early one morning, Ralph received orders to ride forward and reconnoiter the enemy\u0027s position. Passing through the posts of franc tireurs, he rode cautiously along the road; with his hand on the butt of his revolver, and his horse well in hand--ready to turn and ride for his life, on an instant\u0027s notice. Presently, as the road wound through a narrow gorge, lined with trees, he heard a voice say, close in his ear, \"Stop!\" He reined in his horse, and drew his pistol. The leaves parted; and a man of some sixty years of age, armed with an old double-barreled fowling piece, stepped out. \"The Germans are just beyond,\" he said. \"I expect them every moment.\" \"And what are you doing here?\" Ralph asked. \"What am I doing?\" repeated the peasant. \"I am waiting to shoot some of them.\" \"But they will hang you, to a certainty, if they catch you.\" \"Let them,\" the old man said, quietly; \"they will do me no more harm than they have done me. I had a nice farm, near Metz. I lived there with my wife and daughter, and my three boys. Someone fired at the Prussians from a wood near. No one was hit, but that made no difference. The black-hearted scoundrels came to my farm; shot my three boys, before their mother\u0027s eyes; ill treated her, so that she died next day and, when I returned--for I was away, at the time--I found a heap of ashes, where my house had stood; the dead bodies of my three boys; my wife dying, and my daughter sitting by, screaming with laughter--mad--quite mad! \"I took her away to a friend\u0027s house; and stayed with her till she died, too, a fortnight after. Then I bought this gun, and some powder and lead, with my last money; and went out to kill Prussians. I have killed thirteen already and, please God,\" and the peasant lifted his hat, devoutly, \"I will kill two more, today.\" \"How is it that you have escaped so long?\" Ralph asked, in surprise. \"I never fire at infantry,\" the peasant said. \"It was Uhlans that did it, and it\u0027s only Uhlans I fire at. I put myself on a rock, or a hillside, where they can\u0027t come--or in a thick wood--and I content myself with my two shots, and then go. I don\u0027t want to be killed, yet. I have set my mind on having fifty--just ten for each of mine--and when I\u0027ve shot the last of the fifty, the sooner they finish me, the better. \"You\u0027d better not go any farther, sir. The valley widens out, round the corner; and there are Prussians in the nearest village.\" \"Thank you,\" Ralph said, \"but my orders are to reconnoiter them, myself, and I must do so. I am well mounted, and I don\u0027t think that they will catch me, if I get a couple of hundred yards\u0027 start. There are franc tireurs in the village, a mile back.\" Ralph now rode carefully forward, while the peasant went back into his hiding place by the wood. As he had said, the gorge widened into a broad valley, a few hundred yards farther on. Upon emerging from the gorge, Ralph at once saw a village--almost hidden among trees--at a distance of less than a quarter of a mile. After what he had heard, he dared not ride on farther. He therefore drew his horse aside from the road, among some trees; dismounted, and made his way carefully up the rocky side of the hill, to a point from which he could command a view down the whole valley. When he gained this spot, he looked cautiously round. Below, beyond the village, he could see large numbers of men; could make out lines of cavalry horses, and rows of artillery. A considerable movement was going on, and Ralph had no doubt that they were about to advance. In his interest in what he saw, he probably exposed his figure somewhat; and caught the eye of some sharp-sighted sentry, in the village. The first intimation of his danger was given him by seeing some twenty Uhlans dart suddenly out of the trees, in which the village lay, at the top of their speed while, almost at the same moment, eight or ten rifles flashed, and the balls whizzed round him in most unpleasant propinquity. Ralph turned in an instant; and bounded down the rock with a speed and recklessness of which, at any other moment, he would have been incapable. Fierce as was the pace at which the Uhlans were galloping, they were still a hundred yards distant when Ralph leaped upon his horse, and galloped out in front of them. There was a rapid discharge of their carbines, but men at full gallop make but poor shooting. Ralph felt he was untouched but, by the convulsive spring which his horse gave, he knew the animal was wounded. For a couple of hundred yards, there was but little difference in his speed; and then Ralph--to his dismay--felt him flag, and knew that the wound had been a severe one. Another hundred yards, and the animal staggered; and would have fallen, had not Ralph held him up well, with knee and bridle. The Uhlans saw it; for they gave a shout, and a pistol bullet whizzed close to his head. Ralph looked round. An officer, twenty yards ahead of his men, was only about forty yards in his rear. In his hand he held a revolver, which he had just discharged. \"Surrender!\" he shouted, \"or you are a dead man!\" Ralph saw that his pursuers were too close to enable him to carry out his intention of dismounting, and taking to the wood--which, here, began to approach thickly close to the road--and was on the point of throwing up his arm, in token of surrender; when his horse fell heavily, with him, at the moment when the Prussian again fired. Almost simultaneously with the crack of the pistol came the report of a gun; and the German officer fell off his horse, shot through the heart. Ralph leaped to his feet, and dashed up the bank in among the trees; just as another shot was fired, with a like fatal result, into the advancing Uhlans. The rest--believing that they had fallen into an ambush--instantly turned their horses\u0027 heads, and galloped back the road they had come. Ralph\u0027s first impulse was to rush down into the road, and catch the officer\u0027s horse; which had galloped on a short distance when its master fell, and was now returning, to follow its companions. As he did so, the old peasant appeared, from the wood. \"Thank you,\" Ralph said warmly. \"You have saved my life or, at any rate, have saved me from a German prison.\" The peasant paid no attention to him; but stooped down to examine, carefully, whether the Germans were both dead. \"Two more,\" he said, with a grim smile. \"That makes fifteen. Three apiece.\" Then he picked up the officer\u0027s revolver, took the cartridge belonging to it from the pouch and, with a wave of the hand to Ralph, strode back into the wood. Ralph removed the holsters from the saddle of his own horse--which had fallen dead--placed them on the horse of the German officer and then, mounting it, rode off at full speed, to inform General Cambriels of the results of his investigation. \"Hallo, Barclay!\" one of his fellow officers said, as he rode up to the headquarters, \"what have you been up to? Doing a little barter, with a German hussar? You seem to have got the best of him, too; for your own horse was a good one, but this is a good deal better, unless I am mistaken. \"How has it come about?\" Quite a crowd of idlers had collected round, while the officer was speaking; struck, like him, with the singularity of the sight of a French staff officer upon a horse with German trappings. Ralph did not wish to enter into explanations, there; so merely replied, in the same jesting strain, that it had been a fair exchange--the small difference in the value of the horses being paid for, with a small piece of lead. Then, throwing his reins to his orderly--who came running up--he went in to report, to the general, the evident forward movements of the Germans. \"Are they as strong as we have heard?\" the general asked. \"Fully, I should say, sir. I had no means of judging the infantry, but they seemed in large force. They were certainly strong in cavalry, and I saw some eight or ten batteries of artillery.\" \"Let the next for duty ride, with all speed, to Tempe; and tell him to hold the upper end of this valley. Send Herve\u0027s battery forward to assist him. Have the general assembly sounded.\" Ralph left to obey these orders, while the general gave the colonel of his staff the instructions for the disposition of his forces. The army of the Vosges--pompous as was its name--consisted, at this time, of only some ten thousand men; all Mobiles or franc tireurs, with the exception of a battalion of line, and a battalion of Zouaves. The Mobiles were almost undisciplined, having only been out a month; and were, for the most part, armed only with the old muzzle loader. Many were clothed only in the gray trousers, with a red stripe, which forms part of the mobile\u0027s uniform; and in a blue blouse. Great numbers of them were almost shoeless; having been taken straight from the plow, or workshop, and having received no shoes since they joined. Half disciplined, half armed, half clothed, they were too evidently no match for the Germans. The fact was patent to their general, and his officers. Still, his instructions were to make a stand, at all hazards, in the Vosges; and he now prepared to obey the orders--not hoping for victory, but trusting in the natural courage of his men to enable him to draw them off without serious disaster. His greatest weakness was his artillery, of which he had only two batteries; against eight or ten of the Germans--whose forces were, even numerically, superior to his own. In half an hour, the dispositions were made. The valley was wide, at this point; and there were some five or six villages nestled in it. It was pretty thickly wooded and, two miles behind, narrowed again considerably. Just as the troops had gained their appointed places, a faint sound of heavy musketry fire was heard, in the gorge ahead; mingled, in a few minutes, with the deep boom of cannon. The general, surrounded by his staff, moved forward towards the spot. From the road at the entrance to the narrow part of the valley, nothing could be seen; but the cracking of rifles among the trees and rocks on either side, the bursting of shells and the whistling of bullets were incessant. The general and his staff accordingly dismounted, handed their horses to the men of the escort, and mounted the side of the hill. After a sharp climb, they reached a point from whence they could see right down the long narrow valley. On beyond, the trees--except near the road--were thin; the steep sides of the hills being covered with great blocks of stone, and thick brushwood. Among these--all down one side, and up the other--at a distance of some five hundred yards from the post taken up by the general, a succession of quick puffs of smoke told where Colonel Tempe\u0027s franc tireurs were placed; while among the trees below there came up great wreaths of smoke from the battery, which was supporting them by firing at the Germans. These formed a long line, up and down the sides of the valley, at three or four hundred yards distance from the French lines. Two German batteries were down in the road, a few hundred yards to the rear of their skirmishers; and these were sending shells thickly up among the rocks, where the franc tireurs were lying hid; while two other batteries--which the Germans had managed to put a short way up on the mountain sides, still farther in the rear--were raining shell, with deadly precision, upon the French batteries in the road. A prettier piece of warfare it would have been difficult to imagine--the lofty mountain sides; the long lines of little puffs of smoke, among the brushwood and rocks; the white smoke arising from the trees, in the bottom; the quick, dull bursts of the shells--as a spectacle, it was most striking. The noise was prodigious. The steep sides of the mountain echoed each report of the guns into a prolonged roar, like the rumble of thunder. The rattle of the musketry never ceased for an instant, and loud and distinct above the din rose the menacing scream of the shells. \"This is grand, indeed, Ralph!\" Percy said, after a moment\u0027s silence. \"Splendid!\" Ralph said, \"but it is evident we cannot hold the gorge. Their skirmishers are three to our one, and their shells must be doing terrible damage.\" \"Barclay,\" General Cambriels said, \"go down to the battery, and bring me back word how they are getting on.\" The scene quite lost its beauty to Percy, now, as he saw Ralph scramble rapidly down the hillside in the direction of the trees; among which the French battery was placed, and over and among which the shells were bursting, every second. It seemed like entering a fiery furnace. It was a terribly long ten minutes before Ralph was seen, climbing up the hillside again; and Percy\u0027s heart gave a jump of delight, when he first caught sight of his figure. As Ralph came near, his brother saw that he was very pale, and had a handkerchief bound round one arm. This was already soaked with blood. He kept on steadily, however, until he reached the general; who had, upon seeing he was wounded, advanced to meet him. \"One gun is dismounted, sir, and half the men are killed or wounded.\" \"Go down, Harcourt, and tell Herve to fall back at once; and to take position in the clump of trees, a quarter of a mile down the valley, so as to sweep the entrance. \"Laon, go to the right, and you, Dubois, to the left. Order the franc tireurs to retreat along the hillside and, when they get to the end of the gorge, to form in the plain, and fall back to the first village. \"You are wounded, Barclay. Not seriously, I hope?\" he said, kindly, as the officers hurried away on their respective missions. \"A splinter of a shell, sir,\" Ralph said, faintly. \"I don\u0027t think it has touched the bone, but it has cut the flesh badly.\" Ralph was just able to say this, when his head swam; and he would have fallen, had not Percy caught him in his arms, with a little cry. \"He has only fainted from loss of blood,\" the general said. \"Two or three handkerchiefs, gentlemen. \"Now, major, bind them round his arm. \"Now take off his sash, and bind it as tightly as you can, over them. That\u0027s right. \"Now carry him down the rocks, to the horses. We have no time to lose.\" Two of the officers at once put their arms under Ralph\u0027s shoulders, while Percy took his feet; and they hastened down to the horses. As they did so, Ralph opened his eyes. \"I am all right, now,\" he said, faintly. \"Lie quiet,\" the major said, kindly. \"It is only loss of blood. There is no real harm done. \"There, here are the horses.\" Ralph was placed, sitting, on the ground; a little brandy and water was given to him and, as the blood was oozing but slowly through the bandage, he felt sufficiently restored to sit on his horse. \"Doyle, you go with Lieutenant Barclay,\" the colonel of the staff said. \"Ride slowly, and keep close beside him; so as to catch him, if you see him totter. You will find the surgeons ready at the general\u0027s quarters. \"Halt, stand aside for a moment. Here comes the artillery.\" \"Well done, lads, well done!\" the general said, as the diminished battery rattled past, at full gallop. Then he himself, with his staff, put spurs to his horse and went off at full speed; while Tim followed at a walk, riding by the side of Ralph. The flow of blood had now stopped, and Ralph was able to sit his horse until he reached the house which had served as the general\u0027s headquarters, in the morning. Here one of the staff surgeons had fitted up a temporary ambulance; and Ralph\u0027s bandages were soon taken off, and his coat removed. Tim turned sick at the sight of the ugly gash in his young master\u0027s arm, and was obliged to go out into the air. The artillery were already at work, and their fire told that the franc tireurs had retired from the gorge, and that the Germans were entering the wider valley. \"You have had a narrow escape,\" the surgeon said, after examining Ralph\u0027s arm, \"a quarter of an inch lower, and it would have cut the main artery; and you would have bled to death in five minutes. As it is, there is no great harm done. It is a deepish flesh wound but, with your youth and constitution, it will heal up in a very short time. I will draw the edges together, with a needle and thread: put a few straps of plaster on, and a bandage; and then you had better get into an ambulance wagon and go to the rear, at once.\" \"Can\u0027t I go into the field again, now?\" Ralph asked; \"I feel as if I could ride again, now.\" \"No, you can do nothing of the sort,\" the surgeon said. \"You have lost a lot of blood; and if you were to ride now, it might set off the wound bleeding again, and you might be a dead man before you could be brought back here. Keep quiet, and do as you are ordered, and in a week you may be in the saddle again.\" \"It seems very hard,\" Ralph began. \"Not at all hard,\" the surgeon said. \"You will see plenty more fighting, before this war is over. \"This is a hard case, if you like; you have every reason to be thankful.\" As he spoke, he pointed to a young mobile who was brought in, his chest literally torn open with a shell. \"I can do nothing for him,\" the surgeon said, after a brief inspection of his wound; \"he has not half an hour to live, and will probably not recover consciousness. If he does, give him some weak brandy, and water.\" Wounded men were now being brought in fast, and Ralph went out and sat down by the door. \"Fasten my horse up here, Tim. The ambulance will be full of poor fellows who will want them more than I shall. If I see that we are being driven back, I shall mount and ride quietly back. \"No, there is nothing more you can do for me. Go and join Percy.\" The fight was now raging furiously. The Germans, covered by the fire of their artillery, had debouched from the pass and were steadily pressing forward. They had already carried the village nearest to them. This the French had set fire to, before retreating, to prevent its serving as a shelter for the enemy. The Mobiles stood their ground, for the most part well, under the heavy fire of shot and shell; but their muzzle loaders were no match for the Germans\u0027 needle guns, and the enemy were pressing steadily forward. Just as Tim Doyle rode up to the staff, the Germans had taken another village. \"That village must be retaken,\" the general said. \"Barclay, ride and order the Zouaves to carry it, with the bayonet.\" Percy galloped off to where the Zouaves, lying behind a ridge in the ground, were keeping up a heavy fire in answer to the storm of shot and shell which fell around them. He rode up to the officer in command. \"The Zouaves are to retake the village, with the bayonet,\" he said. The colonel gave the order, but the fire was so heavy that the men would not face it. Again and again the officer reiterated the order; standing exposed on the bank, in front of his men, to give them confidence. It was in vain, and the colonel looked towards Percy with an air of despair. Percy turned his horse, and galloped back to the general. \"The colonel has done all he can, sir, but the men won\u0027t advance.\" \"The fire is very heavy,\" the general said, \"but we must have the village back again.\" And he rode off, himself, to the battalion of Zouaves. The shot and shell were flying around him, but he sat on his horse as immovable as if at a review. \"My lads,\" he said, in a loud, clear tone, \"generally the difficulty has been to prevent the Zouaves rushing to an attack. Don\u0027t let it be said that a French general had to repeat, to French Zouaves, an order to charge before they obeyed him.\" In an instant the Zouaves were on their feet and, with a cheer, went at the village. The Germans in possession fired rapidly, as the French approached, and then hastily evacuated it; the Zouaves taking possession, and holding it, under a tremendous fire. All the afternoon the battle raged, villages being taken and retaken, several times. The Germans, however, were gradually gaining ground. Some of the regiments of Mobiles had quite lost all order and discipline, and their officers in vain tried to persuade them to hold the position in which they were placed. Two of the staff officers were killed, three others wounded. Percy had escaped, almost by a miracle. Over and over again, he had carried the general\u0027s orders across ground swept by the enemy\u0027s shot and shell. A horse had been killed under him, but he had not received even a scratch; and now, mounted upon the horse of one of the officers, who was killed, he was returning from carrying an order across a very open piece of ground, at full gallop. Suddenly he came upon a sight which--hurried as he was, and exposed as was the position--caused him instantly to draw his rein, and come to a full stop. Illustration: The Children on the Battlefield. There, in the open field, were two children: the one a boy, of six or seven years old; the other a little flaxen-haired, blue-eyed girl, of five. They were quietly picking flowers. \"What are you doing here?\" Percy asked, in astonishment. He spoke in French and, receiving no answer, repeated the question in German. \"What are you doing here?\" \"If you please, sir,\" the boy answered, \"I have been out in the wood, with Lizzie, to pick flowers; and when I came back there was a great fire in the house, and a great noise all round, and I couldn\u0027t find father and mother; and so we came out, to look for them.\" Percy did not know what to do. It was too pitiful to leave the poor little creatures where they were; and yet, he could not carry them away. He had no doubt that their parents were hid in the woods. \"Look here,\" he said; \"if I take Lizzie upon my horse, will you run along after me?\" \"No, no,\" the little girl said, vehemently. There was no time for parley. \"Look here, do you see those soldiers lying down in a ditch?\" Percy asked, pointing to a line of Mobiles, not fifty yards in front. The children nodded. \"Now look here, the best thing you can possibly do is to play at being soldiers. It is capital fun. You lie down quite flat in that ditch, and throw little stones over the bank. Don\u0027t you go away. Don\u0027t get up, whatever you do; and if you are good children, and play nicely, I will send father and mother to you, if I can find them. If they don\u0027t come, you go on playing at soldiers till all this noise stops; and then, when it is quite quiet, you go home, and wait there till father and mother come back.\" The children were delighted with the idea, and threw themselves flat in the bottom of the ditch; and Percy went on again, at full gallop. The French were now being driven back, towards the point where the valley narrowed again; and many of the Mobiles were in full flight. General Cambriels, therefore, withdrew his artillery to a point where they could cover the movements; and then ordered a rapid retreat--ten regiments of line, and the Zouaves, acting as rear guard. It was already getting dark, and the movements were carried out with but slight loss. The Germans, contented with their success, attempted no movement in pursuit. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3162/86787.html","bookId":872,"book":{"id":872,"title":"The Young Franc Tireurs","description":"简介： The usually quiet old town of Dijon was in a state of excitement.
