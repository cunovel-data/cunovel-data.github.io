{"id":10626,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 15: The Expedition.","content":"A special telegram had been sent forward from Tours to station master at Orleans, to request him to order the two horses, sent forward in the train, to be got out of their boxes without any loss of time; and to do anything else which the owners of the horses required. Accordingly, as the train was waiting outside the station, the guard came round and asked at each carriage for the owners of the horses. He appeared a little surprised, when two Jews answered the inquiry; as he had expected that they were officers of high rank, and importance. \"The compliments of the stationmaster,\" he said, \"and is there anything he can do with the horses?\" \"Yes,\" Ralph said. \"Give my compliments to the station master; and say that I shall be much obliged if he will get them out of the horse boxes, without loss of time, and send them on at once to the headquarters of General Aurelles. We will go on at once, in a vehicle.\" Five minutes afterwards the train drew up at the platform, and the guard ran up. \"This way, gentlemen. A carriage is engaged.\" Upon arriving at headquarters they found that--owing to the forethought of Colonel Tempe--they were expected for, upon sending in their names, they were at once admitted; although several officers, of all grades, were waiting in the anteroom. The colonel of the staff gave a movement of surprise. \"There is some mistake here,\" he said, to the orderly who had shown them in; \"I ordered the Lieutenants Barclay to be admitted.\" \"These are the gentlemen who gave me the card, colonel,\" the orderly answered. \"It is so,\" Ralph said. \"If you will favor us with a moment alone, we will explain the matter to you.\" The colonel led the way into a small cabinet, adjoining. \"We are bearers of dispatches, for General Trochu,\" Ralph said; \"and have disguised ourselves, to endeavor to pass through the German lines.\" \"Oh, is that it?\" the colonel said. \"I must really apologize; but no one,\" he said, smiling, \"could recognize you, in that disguise, to be French officers. Before we speak further, I must ask you for some proof that you are what you state yourselves to be; for at present I have only your cards.\" \"Here is our letter from Monsieur Gambetta to General Aurelles,\" Ralph said. \"It is directed to be opened by you, should he be absent.\" \"That is all right,\" the colonel said, when he had read it. \"My surprise at your appearance was natural, for the telegram we received this morning only said: \"\u0027The two Lieutenants Barclay will arrive, by six o\u0027clock train. Their business is most important. Have a well-mounted officer of staff ready to accompany them through lines.\u0027 \"I thought, of course, that you had orders to report on position of troops; and felt, I admit, rather angry that Gambetta should wish to send subaltern officers to inspect matters concerning which he has full reports. \"You wish, of course, to go on at once?\" \"Our horses will be here in five minutes,\" Ralph said, \"and we wish to get as far as possible, tonight. We mean to cross the Loing at Montargis, and get as far as we can, tonight; so as to arrive either at Meaux, or Melun, tomorrow evening. We should, of course, prefer Melun, as being much the shortest route towards Versailles. We shall, of necessity, be guided by the position of the Germans.\" \"You have not breakfasted, of course?\" the colonel said. \"I was just going to sit down, when you came in; for I go out to the front at ten, and it is half-past nine, now. You will have no chance of getting anything, before you arrive at Montargis. \"I can introduce you to the officer who will accompany you.\" The boys readily accepted the invitation, and at once followed the colonel into another room; where breakfast was laid, and several officers of the staff were waiting for the arrival of the colonel, to begin. There was a general look of surprise, when he entered with two strange-looking Jews; which was not a little increased when he said: \"Gentlemen, the Lieutenants Barclay. You look surprised; but your astonishment will cease when I tell you that they are upon an important mission, and do not look like themselves. And now to table, for they have to start in ten minutes. \"Captain Duprat, let me make you specially acquainted with these gentlemen. They are bound for Montargis, and you will see them through our outposts.\" In another quarter of an hour, the boys were issuing from the streets of Orleans; and were soon going along, at a hand gallop, by the road along the banks of the Loire; while to the north stretched the flat and densely-wooded country known as the Forest of Orleans. As far as Chateauneuf they kept near the river. Here they halted half an hour, to give breathing time to their horses; then started again, and rode fast to Bellegarde. Here was the last post of regular troops, but Cathlineau\u0027s franc tireurs were scattered throughout the country, as far as Montargis; and it would have been more difficult for the Barclays to have passed through them than through the regular troops, as they had less respect for passes. After another halt, they again started; and Captain Duprat accompanied them as far as Montargis, where there was a small body of franc tireurs. Captain Duprat\u0027s orders were to sleep at Montargis, and then return to Chateauneuf the next day. The boys felt rather stiff and tired, as they rode into Montargis; for they had not been on horseback since the day when they were taken prisoners, in the Vosges, and they had ridden forty miles since breakfast. They would, however, have willingly pushed on another twenty miles; but their horses had even a longer day\u0027s work before them, on the morrow. Being accompanied by a staff officer, no questions whatever were asked them and, after a good dinner at the hotel, they went to the Maire, to inquire whether he could tell them as to the advanced posts of the Germans. This functionary--like such functionaries in general--could give them but slight information but, as far as he knew, there were no German troops on the right bank of the Loing, south of its junction with the Yonne. Beyond the Yonne they were scattered pretty thickly, everywhere. At daybreak the next morning, they started. Captain Duprat turned his horse\u0027s head westward again, while the Barclays rode north. Their pace was rapid; as they never drew rein, except at villages, to ask whether the Prussians had been heard of. They heard of parties at Lorrez, and Cheroy; but as they kept through by-lanes, and as the country was thickly wooded, the risk was--at present--small. They had with them an excellent map, which enabled them to follow the smallest footpaths. At eleven o\u0027clock, they stopped at the little hamlet of Montarlet. There they breakfasted, and gave the horses an hour\u0027s rest while they consulted with the Maire. He was a miller, and turned out a shrewd fellow; entering into the matter with great warmth. He advised them to ford the Yonne between Montereau and its junction with the Loing; to keep to the woods for ten miles, and then to turn to the left, and to cross the Seine--at one of the numerous fords there--into the Forest of Fontainebleau; and they would then find themselves between that town and Melun, and could ride boldly into Melun, as if they had come from Fontainebleau. \"I know every foot of the country,\" he said, \"and will guide you, till you are safely across the Seine. If we should, by any chance, fall upon a patrol of the enemy, it will be simple enough to say that I am a miller of Montarlet; and that you have shown me your permission to travel about, through the German line; and have asked me to guide you, by the shortest way, to Melun.\" They had every reason to be thankful to their guide, for they found that there were a great many scattered parties of Uhlans about. By dint of making detours through woods, however, they succeeded in striking the Seine, at Fontaine le Port, without once meeting them. This village was, however, occupied by some half-dozen cavalry; and it was impossible to pass the river, unseen by them. The Barclays thanked, very warmly, their friend the Maire, and promised to mention his conduct, upon their return to Tours; and then, saying goodbye to him, rode into the village alone. The sergeant of Uhlans came to the door of the principal cabaret, and looked out. \"Good day,\" Ralph said, in German, reining up his horse. \"Is it here that I cross the river, for Fontainebleau? They told me, at Le Chatelet, that it was shorter than going round by the main road.\" \"Yes, you are right here,\" the sergeant said. \"Have you passes?\" \"Oh yes,\" Ralph said, laughing. \"It would have been no easy matter to get from Frankfort here, without them.\" So saying, he pulled out the Prussian permit. \"That is right,\" the sergeant said. \"Your horses look very done.\" \"We have ridden from Coulommiers through Rozoy, and Normant.\" \"It would have been an easier road to have gone from Normant through Melun,\" the sergeant said. And he took out a map, and examined it. \"No, I see le Chatelet is a more direct line.\" \"We have time to wait an hour,\" Ralph said, turning to Percy; \"and it will be better for our beasts. See that they are rubbed down, and fed.\" The sergeant gave a peremptory shout, and the master of the wine shop ran out. The sergeant pointed to the horses. \"Do you speak French?\" he asked Ralph. \"No,\" Ralph said, \"but my son does. \"Aaron, tell him to rub them down, and feed them well; and see to it, yourself. These dogs are capable of cheating even a horse.\" Ralph then entered the cabaret, and called for some bread and cheese and a bottle of the best wine, with three glasses. The Prussian sergeant sat down with them, and talked of Germany for an hour. Then they started again, crossed the river and, an hour and a half later, entered Melun. Here, as they came in by the road from Fontainebleau--which was held in force by the Germans--no question was asked. They rode their tired horses through the streets, until they saw a quiet hotel. Riding into the yard, they told the hostler to put up their horses, and to clean and feed them well; enforcing their request with a five-franc piece. They then entered the hotel, and found that they could have beds; as the number of German officers quartered upon this house was smaller than usual, owing to the greater portion of the troops having been pushed on, to reinforce Von der Tann. It was now half-past five, and was already dusk. They therefore went at once to the Maire; to whom they presented Gambetta\u0027s letter, and requested his assistance in purchasing a van, with a pair of good strong horses, at once. \"It will be next to impossible to get horses,\" the Maire said, \"but I will do my best. I have two carriage horses, of good breed; but I fear, if I were to let you have them, the Prussians might remark it.\" \"We have two first-rate animals,\" Ralph said, \"from Gambetta\u0027s own stables. They have carried us a hundred miles, since breakfast time yesterday. They are likely to be at least as good as yours are, only they want a few days\u0027 rest. Will you exchange?\" \"Certainly,\" the Maire said, at once. \"If any inquiries were to be made about it, I need make no secret of that transaction. \"As for the covered cart, I will send round at once to those of my neighbors who have one; and as you are ready to pay for it, and as the Prussians are requisitioning them without payment, you can rely upon having one tomorrow morning, ready for your start. I will send a note round to you, tonight, to tell you where it is, at present.\" \"We had better go now to the German commandant\u0027s office, and get our passes countersigned. When that is done, we shall be all right for Versailles.\" \"Yes, I should advise you to do that,\" the Maire said. \"You will not have much difficulty. They are civil enough about passes, and matters of that kind. Will you mention you have seen me?\" \"Not unless any question is asked about horses; in which case we should of course mention that--hearing you had a pair of horses, and ours requiring rest--we had changed with you.\" They now went boldly to the orderly room. An officer was on duty. \"Will you please to visa this for Versailles?\" Ralph said, in German. The officer took it, glanced at it, and at them. \"The last visa I see was at Meaux, a fortnight since.\" \"We have been traveling on horseback, since,\" Ralph said; \"and have had no occasion to have it visaed, as it has always passed us without trouble. As we are now going to Versailles, with a wagon, we thought it better to have the pass visaed here.\" \"Where have you come from, now?\" \"From Fontainebleau,\" Ralph said. \"We have been down to Pithiviers, and I sent off four wagon loads of things from there, for the frontier.\" \"Your best way is through Corbeil, and Longjumeau,\" the officer said, handing back the paper. \"Thank you, sir,\" Ralph replied, \"that is the way we are intending to go.\" In the evening, the Maire himself came in to look at the horses; and told them that he had obtained a good light-covered wagon, with springs, which had been used for the removal of furniture. The price was a thousand francs. \"If you like,\" he said, \"to come round with me now; my servant shall take the horses round there, put them in, and bring the wagon here; and he can then take your horses back with him to my stables. \"Please to write me a paper--signed by the name on your German pass--saying that you have bought my horses of me, and have sold me yours. Put down any figures you like as having passed between us. You are upon a very perilous expedition and, in case of anything happening to you, it would be well for me that nothing, beyond a mere business transaction, could be traced between us.\" At seven o\u0027clock the next morning they started. The distance was only thirty miles, but the roads were terribly slippery from the deep snow, now trampled flat by the immense traffic of the army. It was five in the afternoon when they reached the first sentries, at the entrance to Versailles. The pass was sufficient, and they went on uninterrupted. Percy drove, and Ralph sat beside him. The town swarmed with officers and soldiers, of all ranks. No one paid them any attention, and they drove through the Place d\u0027Armes and on to the marketplace; where they knew there were many inns, frequented by the market people. Here--as they expected--they found it impossible to get a bed; but they had no difficulty in obtaining permission for the wagon to stand in a yard, and were lucky enough to get stable room for the horses. They went into the town and bought four blankets; and as, at starting, they had filled the wagon two feet deep with straw, they had--in spite of the cold weather--every hope of passing a comfortable night. Dinner was the next thing and, that over, they strolled about until nine o\u0027clock. It was a singular sight, this army of invaders comfortably quartered in the ancient capital of France. The palace, the statues in front of it, everything told of the glories of France; every park around, every little palace was infinitely associated with its sovereigns; and here, in the midst of these memorials, the German invaders stalked carelessly, drank in the cafes, or feasted in the hotels, as if the place had belonged to them from time immemorial. Afar off, in the quiet of the evening, could be heard the distant boom of the guns round the beleaguered city. There were several things which the Barclays wanted to get; but they had no difficulty with them, as the shops were all open, as usual. The population had a depressed look. All classes were suffering much, with the exception of the shopkeepers, whose business was as brisk as ever--save only those tradesmen who dealt in articles of female attire, for which there was no demand, whatever. The ladies of Versailles went as little as possible into the streets; and when they did so, all dressed themselves in black, or other somber colors. By nine o\u0027clock the shops were all closed; and the Barclays returned to their wagon, with their purchases in their hands. \"It\u0027s awfully cold, Ralph!\" Percy said, as they rolled themselves in their blankets, and covered themselves over with straw. \"It is, Percy; but it will be a deal colder, in the river.\" Percy gave a shudder at the thought. \"Don\u0027t you think, Ralph, that there is any possibility of entering on either of the other sides?\" \"Not the slightest, Percy. It must be across the river, or not at all. The sentries will not be anything like so thick, upon that side.\" Had anyone looked into the wagon, at eight o\u0027clock next morning, he would have been surprised at the occupation upon which the boys were engaged. Each was sewing a piece of thin waterproof cloth upon a pair of white woolen gloves; so that the fingers, when outspread, had the appearance of the webbed foot of a frog. \"That ought to help us,\" Ralph said, when they finished. \"For a really long swim, I daresay they would be very fatiguing; but it is cold, not fatigue, we have to fear, and speed is therefore everything.\" At nine o\u0027clock, Ralph went to the office of the general in command. There were a number of other persons waiting for permits, and Ralph waited his turn to go in to the officer engaged in signing them. \"I am from Frankfort, as my papers show,\" he said, handing the officer his pass. \"I wish for a pass to go, with my horse and cart, to Bellevue. There are, I hear, many officers desirous of selling, or sending home, articles they have saved.\" Saved, it may be mentioned, was the word employed in the German army for stolen--which has an ugly sound. The officer signed the paper. \"You must not go by the Sevres route,\" he said. \"You must turn off at Viroflay, and go by Chaville.\" Half an hour later they started in the wagon At the gates of Versailles-- a mile from the town--they were stopped by sentries; but allowed to pass on production of the order, with the necessary stamp. \"Everything is going on well, thus far,\" Ralph said, as they turned off from the main road, at Viroflay. \"It looks like snow, too, which would exactly suit us.\" Viroflay was crowded with Prussian troops. An officer stopped them, as they passed. \"Where are you going to?\" \"We are going to Bellevue,\" Ralph said. \"We are purchasers of any curiosities or souvenirs of the war--such as pictures, or clocks--and we also undertake to deliver, in Germany, any article which may be entrusted to our charge. We have our passes and papers, in regular order.\" \"Wait a minute,\" the officer said. \"Draw up at that villa there.\" The wagon drew up to the villa, the officer walking in front. He motioned to Ralph to dismount, and to follow him into the house; leaving Percy in charge of the wagon Five or six officers were sitting in what had been the drawing room of the villa. \"Who have you got here?\" one of them asked, as Ralph\u0027s conductor entered. \"A worthy Hebrew,\" the other laughed, \"who will either purchase, or carry home, articles saved.\" There was a general movement of interest. The furniture of the room was a wreck, the papers were hanging in strips, a broken chair was blazing upon the fire; several family portraits on the wall were pierced with holes, having evidently served the purpose of targets, for pistol shooting. Ralph\u0027s conductor left the room for a moment, and returned with a very handsome drawing room clock; worth, Ralph knew, at least fifteen hundred francs. \"How much will you give for that?\" Ralph examined it critically. \"Four hundred francs,\" he said. \"Nonsense! It cost five times that.\" \"About four times,\" Ralph said, \"when it was new. It is not new, now, and it has to be taken to Germany. If you prefer it, I will carry it to Frankfort; and send it on thence by rail, at ten percent upon its value.\" \"Yes, I will agree to that,\" the officer said. \"How much will that be?\" \"I am content to take it at your own valuation,\" Ralph said. \"The value you set upon the clock was two thousand francs.\" There was a laugh among the other officers. \"He has you there, major.\" \"Not at all,\" the officer said. \"He shall take it at the valuation he placed upon it--four hundred francs.\" \"Pardon me,\" Ralph said, \"I did not value it at that sum, I only offered to give that sum for it; besides which, that was an estimate of the value I set upon it at Viroflay, not the value I should set upon it at Frankfort. \"I will say one thousand francs; that is, I will undertake it at a hundred, if you will get it put into a case of some sort.\" The other officers now offered various objects, either for sale or transport--pictures, vases, clocks, and even pianos. Ralph haggled over the price of each article, in a way which would have done honor to his appearance. At last--having arranged all their matters--he said that he was going on to Bellevue; but would call and complete the purchases, and receive the goods entrusted to him, either that night or the next morning. \"If any of you gentleman would kindly give me your card, to give to the officer of the regiment at Bellevue, saying that you have found me fair in my dealing, I should feel very grateful,\" Ralph said, humbly. The officer laughed, but one of them took out his card, and wrote upon it: \"Dear Von Koch, this man is--for a Hebrew--tolerably fair in his ideas.\" \"That is for the major of the regiment, at Bellevue,\" he said; and Ralph bowed, as if he had received a recommendation of the warmest kind. \"I was beginning to be alarmed, Ralph,\" Percy said, when his brother again took his place in the wagon. \"I have been haggling over prices,\" Ralph said. \"Fortunately, we are not pressed for time.\" They had another stop, of some duration, at Chaville; and it was nearly three o\u0027clock in the afternoon before they came down to the back of Bellevue. Here they were stopped and, upon Ralph producing his pass, an officer came up. \"You cannot go any farther,\" he said. \"You are close to Bellevue, now; but if you were to take this wagon into the main road, you would draw Valerien\u0027s fire upon us, at once. \"You will find most of the officers there,\" pointing to a large house, near. \"I have this card, for Major Von Koch,\" Ralph said. \"I am here to buy, or carry home on commission, goods of all kinds.\" The officer went with Ralph; and the scene at Viroflay was repeated, but upon a much larger scale. Viroflay is a small village, containing only a few large villas; Bellevue is composed almost entirely of handsome residences, owned by Parisians. The quantity of articles \"saved\" was proportionately large. After examining and bargaining for a large number of valuable articles of furniture, pictures and clocks; Ralph left, with some of the officers, to view other articles in the villas upon the side of Bellevue, looking down upon the river. Percy had taken the horses out of the wagon, and accompanied his brother, ostensibly to carry back any articles purchased. At one of the villas Ralph expressed a great desire to go out into the garden, to look over Paris; and the officer with him--being in an excellent humor, at the disposal of some articles at much higher prices than he had expected to receive; and at having the proceeds, in German bank notes, in his pockets--went out himself, and pointed out all the various objects of interest. The fog of a winter\u0027s evening was already shutting in the view, but the boys could see the principal buildings of Paris. The towers of Notre Dame, the domes of the Pantheon and Invalides, the heights of Montmartre and Vilette, and the forts of Issy and Vanves were distinctly visible. The boys\u0027 eyes turned, however, more to the river at their feet, and the intervening ground, than upon the objects--however interesting--of distant Paris. \"Do not show yourself,\" the officer said. \"If we were caught sight of, from Issy or Point du Jour--or from that gunboat, below--we should have a rain of shells about us, in no time. You can look out from among the trees; but do not get beyond their shelter, or you will be seen, instantly.\" The house in whose garden they were standing stood upon the brow of the hill. Behind was a little wood, and gardens sloping pretty-steeply down. Then along by the water was a street, with houses upon either side. The river was, here, divided by an island; the lower end of which, however, scarcely extended low enough to be opposite to the spot upon which the boys were standing. \"Bless me,\" Ralph said, \"it must be very dangerous, living down there. Why, that gunboat could blow the place into the air.\" \"That she could,\" the officer said, \"and consequently, none of our men live there. We have sentries along the river bank, and a few others scattered about; but none of the troops are quartered there, nor even in this line of villas where we now are. If we were to show a light at night, in any window here, we should have a shell in in a couple of minutes. We have no fear, whatever, of a sortie in this direction; and have plenty of force behind.\" Ralph and Percy lingered, upon one excuse or another; asking questions as long as they could, and making the best use of their time, to gain a fair idea of the ground that they would have to cross. They had with them, in the wagon, a map of Bellevue and Meudon upon a large scale, with every house marked upon it. \"It is going to be a dark night,\" the officer said, as they hurried away, \"and we shall have snow before midnight.\" Another hour or two was spent in purchasing various articles, taken from the French villas. Darkness had come on, and Ralph told the officers that he should not return until the next morning to Versailles; and that if the articles to be entrusted to his care for delivery were put in rough cases--of which there were plenty, which had come full of stores--and brought by ten o\u0027clock in the morning, carefully directed, it would be in sufficient time. \"Will you give us leave to sleep in one of the villas, upon the farther side of the road?\" Ralph asked the officer in command. \"My boy has never seen a shot fired, in earnest; and I should like him to be able to say he had watched the fire of the forts, round Paris.\" \"If you sleep there,\" the colonel said, \"you must not light a fire, or show a light, or you would bring the fire of a hundred guns upon us.\" \"I will be very careful, sir,\" Ralph answered. \"Will you kindly let an orderly go with us, to pass us through the sentries? For, as it\u0027s dark now, they would not let us pass.\" The colonel gave the order, and an orderly went with them. They stopped at the wagon, and each took out a large bundle. \"We shall want our blankets, tonight,\" Ralph said. \"It is bitterly cold. \"Would you like a glass of brandy, to help keep it out, my man?\" The soldier smiled an assent, drank off a glass of brandy, and then accompanied them to the villa. Short as was the distance, they were challenged twice, and the sign and counter-sign had to be exchanged. They reached the deserted villa, threw down the bundles in a corner; and then the orderly said good night, and left them to themselves. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3162/86791.html","bookId":872,"book":{"id":872,"title":"The Young Franc Tireurs","description":"简介： The usually quiet old town of Dijon was in a state of excitement.
