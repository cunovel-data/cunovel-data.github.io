{"id":10628,"no":18,"title":"Chapter 17: A Balloon Voyage.","content":"For eight-and-forty hours, Percy\u0027s fever and delirium continued unabated. At the end of that time, he fell into a long sleep; and the doctor, as he felt his hand and heard his breathing, told his brother that he thought the crisis was over, and that he would awaken, conscious. His prognostication turned out well founded and, to Ralph\u0027s intense delight, Percy knew him when he opened his eyes. He was weak--weaker than Ralph could have supposed anyone could possibly have become, after only two days\u0027 illness. But he was fairly convalescent. Ralph had scarcely left him, during these two days; and had only been out once from the hotel. He had sent for a newspaper; to read for himself, in the Gazette, the promotion which General Trochu had notified to him and, after doing so, he turned to another portion; and there, among the lists of decorations given, were the names of Percy and himself, as promoted to be commanders of the Legion for having, with extreme gallantry, conveyed dispatches from Tours to Paris, through the German lines. It was after reading this newspaper that Ralph went out. His walk was not a long one. He went first to a tailor, and ordered two captain\u0027s uniforms; for Percy was so nearly his own size that--except that his shoulders were an inch less in width--Ralph\u0027s clothes fitted him exactly. He then went to the Palais Royal, where there are several shops which sell nothing but medals, and decorations; and bought two ribbons of the commander\u0027s rank, in the legion of honor. One terrible morning Ralph spent in a hairdresser\u0027s hands and, at the cost of no little pain, got rid of all that mass of hair which had so transformed him. The stain was now nearly worn off the skin; and Ralph was quite surprised, when he again looked at himself in the glass. \"I was about beginning to forget,\" he said, with a laugh, \"that I was a boy, after all.\" The first day of Percy\u0027s convalescence, he dozed a good deal; but the next day he woke, much brighter and better. \"Look here, Percy,\" Ralph said, laying the ribbon before him; \"that\u0027s better than medicine for you. There is the ribbon of a commander of the legion of honor. You can safely boast that you are the youngest who ever wore it; and earned it well, too, old man. Won\u0027t they be pleased, at home? And we are both gazetted as captains.\" Percy smiled with pleasure. His attack had been a very sharp one; but so short an illness, however severe, is speedily got over. The doctor had, that morning, said that all he wanted now was building up; and that, in a very few days, he would be about. Indeed, Percy wanted to get up that day; insisting that he was quite strong. When he once stood up, however, he found he was much weaker than he had imagined; but sat up in an armchair, all the evening. The next day he remained up all day and, three days after, he felt strong enough to go to the governor with Ralph, to ask for their promised places in the next balloon. It was now the twenty-third of November. A carriage was sent for and, after some difficulty, procured; for carriages were already becoming scarce, in Paris. They drove up to the entrance, and went in; but were told by an orderly--who could scarcely conceal his surprise at these lads, in the uniform of captains of the staff, and with decorations scarcely ever seen, except upon the breasts of superior officers--that the general was out. They turned and went out but, as they reached the steps, a number of officers rode up. \"There is General Trochu himself, with Vinoy and Ducrot,\" Ralph said. The generals dismounted, and came up the steps. As they did so their eyes fell upon the boys, who both saluted. They paused, in surprise. \"What masquerade is this, young gentlemen?\" General Trochu asked, sternly. \"Allow me to ask how you venture to dress up as captains, on the staff; and still more how you dare to put on the ribbons of commanders of the legion of honor? \"It is no laughing matter,\" he said, angrily, as Ralph could not resist a smile. \"It is a punishable offence; and your impudence in showing yourselves off, at my door, makes the matter the more unpardonable.\" \"I see, general, that you do not remember us.\" \"I do not, sir,\" General Trochu said, looking at him sternly. \"To the best of my belief, I never set eyes upon you before.\" The numerous staff of officers--who had accompanied the generals, and who were scattered thickly around them-- gave an angry murmur; for scarce one among them wore the coveted decoration. \"I am Ralph Barclay, and this is my brother Percy,\" Ralph said, respectfully. \"Impossible!\" the three generals exclaimed, simultaneously; while there was a general exclamation of surprise, from the officers round--for the courageous deed of the Barclays, in making their way through the enemy\u0027s lines, had been a general topic of conversation, and all Paris was familiar with their names. \"It is so, general,\" Ralph said, respectfully. \"I explained to you, at the interview that I had the honor of having with you, in the presence of Generals Ducrot and Vinoy, that it was the false hair which made all the difference; and that I was but little older than my brother.\" The generals no longer doubted. They all shook both boys by the hand. \"I am astounded,\" General Trochu said; \"astounded that two such mere boys, as I now see you are, should have accomplished what you have done. However, courage is of no age; and I do not think that there are any here,\"--and he turned to the officers round him--\"who will not agree with me that these ribbons are worthily placed.\" \"No, indeed,\" was the general reply; and the officers all pressed round, to shake hands with the boys, as they accompanied the governor back into the house. General Trochu went at once into his private study, and told the boys to sit down. \"Now, what can I do for you, boys?\" \"Monsieur Gambetta promised us that he would write, to ask for us to have places in the first balloon which came out, after we arrived,\" Ralph said. \"Owing to my brother\u0027s illness, I have not been able to ask, before; but I am now anxious to leave as soon as possible, especially as the doctor says that change is desirable for my brother, and that he ought to have at least a month\u0027s nursing, at home, before he gets on horseback again.\" \"A balloon will start tomorrow morning,\" General Trochu said, \"but if you choose to stay here, I will promise you both places upon my own staff; or upon those of Generals Ducrot or Vinoy--either of whom would, I am sure, be very glad to receive you.\" \"You are very kind, indeed, sir--very kind; and we feel greatly honored by your offer,\" Ralph said, gratefully. \"Had we any intention, whatever, of remaining in the army, we should accept it, with many thanks; but it is not so. We are English; and at the end of the war we leave France, and go back to live at home. We entered the ranks with no thought of winning promotion, or favor; but simply from a sense of duty to the country to which our mother belonged, and in which we were born. \"There will, I suppose, be a great battle fought near Orleans, shortly; and I should like to be present, if possible--and Percy wants rest. Therefore, general, while thanking you most warmly for your kindness, we would rather go out.\" \"Very well,\" the general said, \"it shall be as you wish. There is certainly more chance of your seeing stirring service, in the field, than in here. I do not blame you for your choice. I will send a note at once to Monsieur Teclier--who has charge of the balloon--to say that you will accompany him. \"Goodbye, lads, goodbye; you are fine young fellows, and your father has every right to be proud of you. Tell him so, from me.\" The boys rose, and bowed; but the general held out his hand, and shook theirs warmly. Upon leaving the room, they found several of the officers of the staff waiting outside; who begged them to stay, and have a chat with them. Ralph at once accepted the invitation; upon the condition that Percy should have a sofa upon which to lie down, for his brother was looking pale, and faint. They were most warmly received, in a large drawing room, in which were over a dozen officers of different ranks. Some bottles of champagne were opened, cigars were lit and, while Percy lay quietly upon the sofa, Ralph chatted with the officers; relating, at their earnest request, several of their adventures in the Vosges, as well as the story of their entering into Paris. His new friends warmly pressed them to stop and dine with them; but Ralph pleaded that the balloon was to start at five in the morning, and that he wished Percy to lie down, and get a good night\u0027s sleep before starting. The carriage had been discharged, hours since; but one of the officers ordered a carriage of General Trochu\u0027s to the door and, after a hearty leave taking, the boys returned to their hotel. \"What a curious scene it is, Percy,\" Ralph said. \"Who would think that we were in a besieged city? Everything looks very much as usual: the shops are open; people walk about and chat, and smoke, and drink their coffee or absinthe, just as usual. The only difference is, that everyone is in some sort of uniform or other. One does not see a single able-bodied man altogether in civilian dress; and at night the streets are very dismal, owing to there being no gas.\" \"How much longer do they seem to expect to hold out, Ralph?\" \"Another two months, anyhow; perhaps three, or even more. There seems to be a large stock of everything, and everyone is put on to a regular allowance--just enough to live upon, and no more.\" \"I seem to have everything I want, Ralph; lots of beef tea, and soup, and jelly, and so on.\" \"Yes, Percy; but you obtain your food from the hospital. The hotel could not furnish anything of the kind, I can tell you. \"Here we are. Now you lie down at once, and get to sleep. I will wake you in plenty of time.\" At ten minutes before the appointed time, the boys arrived at the Northern Railway Station; which presented a very different appearance to that which it ordinarily wore. No whistle of locomotives, or rumble of heavy trains, disturbed the silence of the station. A smell of varnish pervaded the whole place; and several empty balloons hung from the roof, undergoing the process of drying. The official--who had received them at the entrance--conducted them outside the station; and there, in the light of some torches, a great black mass could be seen, swaying heavily to and fro. The aeronaut was standing beside it. \"Here are the gentlemen who accompany you,\" the officer said to him. \"How are you, gentlemen?\" he said, cheerily. \"We have a fine night, or rather morning; the wind is northerly. I suppose this is your first ascent?\" \"Yes, indeed,\" Ralph said, \"and I own I hope it will be the last. Have the dispatches arrived?\" \"No; I have the mail bags, but not the dispatches Hush! There are a horse\u0027s hoofs.\" A few minutes afterwards a railway official brought a note, which he delivered to Monsieur Teclier. \"Bah!\" he said, in an annoyed tone, \"why cannot they be punctual?\" \"What is it, sir?\" Ralph asked. \"A note from the general, to say that the dispatches will not be ready for an hour. That means an hour and a half; and by that time it will be light enough to be seen, and we shall have to run the gauntlet. However, I suppose it cannot be helped. \"The best thing will be to pass the time as cheerfully as we can; and that certainly will not be in waiting out here, in this bitter cold. I have, fortunately, a few bottles of excellent wine in the car; so I propose, gentlemen, that we go in to a fire, have a glass of wine, and smoke a cigar, tranquilly.\" Monsieur Teclier gave a few directions concerning the balloon; and they then adjourned to a work shed near, where a good fire was blazing, for the use of the men employed in filling the balloon. Here the hour and a half of waiting passed pleasantly. At a quarter to seven, the dispatches arrived. They were hastily placed in the car, in which everything else had already been packed. The Barclays took their place, the word was given, \"Let go all!\" and, in another instant, the earth seemed to sink away from under them, and they were rising over the tops of the houses. The dawn had already broken, gray and uncertain. Light clouds were floating overhead. For two or three minutes, not a word was spoken. The scene was so wonderful--the effect so extraordinary, to the boys--that they were unable to utter a word. Every instant, the earth seemed to sink away from them; every instant, their view extended farther and farther; and the distant fields, villages, and hills seemed actually to spring into sight. \"It is wonderful!\" Ralph said, at last. \"Magnificent!\" Percy responded. \"I wonder whether they see us?\" Ralph said. \"We shall soon know,\" Monsieur Teclier said. \"We have crossed the river, and over the walls already. In another five minutes, we shall be over their lines.\" There were good telescopes in the car, and the boys directed them upon the immense panorama below them. \"What fort is that, immediately beneath us?\" Ralph asked. \"That is Vanves. The village you see there is Chatillon. Look out now, we may expect visitors, in a minute.\" He had hardly spoken before they heard a faint sound, followed by others similar. \"That is musketry,\" Monsieur Teclier said. \"Listen.\" They did listen, and heard a peculiar whistling sound; which seemed below, around, and about them. \"That is a whistle of bullets; there is no mistaking them,\" Ralph said. \"We are too low,\" Monsieur Teclier said. \"Throw out that bundle of newspapers; we will go up a little.\" Ralph did so. \"What would be the consequence, if a bullet hit the balloon?\" \"No consequence at all, except that a slight escape of gas would take place. \"There, we are going into the clouds now, and they will not trouble any more about us.\" \"I thought that we were going to have wind,\" Ralph said. \"The barometer at the hotel had fallen a good deal; and the clouds, before we started, looked like it but, now we are once up here, we do not seem to move.\" In another two minutes, they passed through the layer of clouds, and the sun shone brightly upon them. They looked down on a sea of white mist, without a break. \"There,\" Ralph continued, \"we are entirely becalmed. These clouds below do not move, nor do we.\" \"You cannot tell that,\" Monsieur Teclier said. \"We go in the same direction, and at the same speed, as the clouds. It is just as if you were in a boat, at night, upon a rapid stream. If you could see no banks, or other stationary objects, you might believe yourself to be standing still; while you were being drifted forward, at the rate of twenty miles an hour. We may be traveling, now, forty or fifty miles an hour; and as I agree with you, as to the look of the clouds before starting, I believe that we are doing so--or, at any rate, that we are traveling fast--but in what direction, or at what rate, I have no means, whatever, of knowing. \"Even if we found that we moved, relatively to the clouds below us, that would only show that this upper current was somewhat different from that below.\" \"But how are we to find out about it?\" Percy asked. \"We must keep a sharp lookout for rifts in the clouds. If we could get a peep of the earth, only for a minute, it would be sufficient to tell us the direction and, to some extent, the speed at which we are going.\" The boys, in vain, hung over the side. The sea of clouds beneath them changed, and swelled, and rolled its masses of vapor over each other; as if a contest of some gigantic reptiles were going on with them. \"There must be a great deal of wind, to account for these rapid changes of form,\" Percy said, after a long silence. \"Suppose you see nothing of the earth? At what time will you begin to descend?\" \"In five hours from the time of starting, at twenty-five miles an hour--supposing that the wind holds north--we should fall south of the Loire, somewhere between Orleans and Bourges. At eleven o\u0027clock, then, I will let out gas; and go down below the clouds, to see whereabouts we are. If we cannot recognize the country, or see any river which may guide us, we shall at least see our direction and rate of movement; and can either throw out more newspapers, and keep on for awhile, or descend at once.\" It was just ten o\u0027clock, when Ralph gave a sudden cry. \"The sea!\" he said; \"the sea!\" \"Impossible,\" Monsieur Teclier said, hanging over the side; \"I can see nothing.\" \"Nor can I, now,\" Ralph said; \"but I caught a glimpse, just now, and I will almost swear to its being the sea--though how we could get there, I don\u0027t know.\" \"If it is,\" the aeronaut said, \"the wind must be blowing half a gale, up here; and must have changed entirely, either to the west or south. It is too serious to hesitate; we must find out if your eyes have not deceived you.\" So saying, he pulled the valve. \"Keep a sharp lookout, and look at the compass.\" \"There, there!\" the boys cried, as the clouds opened again, for an instant. \"It is the sea, and we are going west.\" \"Then we are over the Atlantic,\" Monsieur Teclier said. The gas was roaring from the valve above, and the balloon sank rapidly into the stratum of clouds. For a minute, all was silent; and then a cry broke from them all. They were a considerable distance from the coast, and were driving along with great rapidity. Immediately under the balloon was an island, of no great size and, beyond that, no land whatever was visible. \"We must descend on that island, or we are lost. It is our only chance.\" The valve was still open; and its influence was easily seen, for the balloon sank rapidly down through the opening of the clouds. \"We shan\u0027t be down in time,\" the boys exclaimed, simultaneously. It was but too evident. The balloon, when the first general view of the situation had been obtained, was fully a mile high; and was traveling seaward at the rate of thirty miles an hour. The island, at the point at which they were crossing, was about three miles wide; but they had passed fully half a mile over it, before they obtained a fair view. In five minutes, therefore, they would be beyond the land again; and they had to fall a mile, in that time. \"Cut the balloon to pieces,\" Monsieur Teclier said. \"Tear it up. We must risk everything.\" The boys seized the silk, tore, and hacked at it; as did the aeronaut. In two minutes, a vast quantity of gas had escaped from the rents, and the silk was doubled up near the top of the net. Illustration: The Sea! The Sea! \"That will do,\" Monsieur Teclier said. \"We shall be down in time, now.\" The boys looked over the car and, accustomed as they had been to face danger, were appalled. \"It is all up with us, this time,\" Ralph said; \"we shall he smashed, altogether.\" \"No,\" the aeronaut exclaimed, \"the silk is acting as a parachute, now, and checking the descent. Now, help me to throw out all the bundles.\" They did so, working silently and with difficulty; for the car was oscillating so greatly that they were obliged to hold on, by its side, not to be thrown out. The descent was less rapid than it had been, but was still sufficiently alarming. \"Is there a chance?\" Ralph said. \"We shall get off with a shaking,\" Monsieur Teclier said. \"The car is made of wicker work, and is as elastic as a ball. drop the grapnel, now; in another minute, we shall be within holding distance.\" As the balloon neared the ground, the oscillation became less violent, and the pace diminished. \"The grapnel is on the ground,\" Percy said, looking over. \"Hold tight, hold tight,\" Monsieur Teclier said, warningly. \"We shall catch fast on to those trees.\" There was a tearing and rending, a series of tremendous jerks, and then a bump against the ground; which threw them all into the bottom of the car, from which the next jerk threw them out on to the ground. Fortunately the ground was even, and the soil had lately been plowed; but the shock was so violent that it was some minutes before either of the boys recovered consciousness. When they did so, they found that two or three gentlemen were leaning over them; while several peasants were endeavoring, under the direction of Monsieur Teclier, to hold the balloon--which was thrashing the ground with great violence. \"Thank God, you are all alive,\" one of the gentlemen said. A peasant now came running up, with some water. The gentleman who had spoken dashed a little in their faces. \"I do not think any of your limbs are broken,\" he said. \"Do you feel any pain?\" \"I feel sore and bruised, all over,\" Ralph said, getting up with some assistance; \"but I don\u0027t think that anything serious is the matter. \"How are you, Percy?\" \"I don\u0027t think I am hurt seriously, Ralph; but I would rather lie still, for the present.\" Ralph explained to the gentleman--who again leaned over Percy, and felt his pulse--that his brother had been recently ill, and was still weak. \"Ah, that accounts for it,\" the gentleman said. \"I do not think that he is seriously hurt. I am a doctor; and was luckily out riding with these gentlemen, when we happened to look up and saw your balloon falling, like a stone, from the clouds. We thought at first that you must be dashed to pieces; but when we saw that the speed was being a little checked, we had some hope, and galloped in the direction in which it was falling. We were within five hundred yards when you fell, but we hardly expected to see anyone alive. \"Do not try to move,\" he said to Percy. \"We sent a man for a vehicle, and a few necessaries, before we set off ourselves.\" \"Where have we fallen?\" Ralph asked. \"We were astonished to find ourselves over the sea, for the wind was north when we started.\" \"You have fallen upon Belle Isle,\" the gentleman said, \"so the wind must have changed materially, since you started.\" Monsieur Teclier now came up. \"I must really congratulate you both,\" he said to Ralph, \"upon your coolness and presence of mind, in a very frightful position. The oldest aeronaut could not have shown more nerve.\" \"You see,\" Ralph said, \"we have been pretty often in danger, now; and although the sort of danger was new, the degree of danger was not.\" The gentlemen smiled a little, as Ralph spoke. The Barclays had come out in plain clothes, bringing their uniform in the balloon for, in the event of the balloon having fallen among the Germans, it was of course essential that they should be able to get off, unobserved. They therefore looked mere lads; and their talk, of having passed through as great a danger as that which had just made the spectators of it feel faint and sick only to witness, appeared to be a mere bit of exaggerated braggadocio. A light cart now arrived, in which some mattresses had been laid; some bandages, and other surgical necessaries had also been added, together with a bottle of brandy. \"Fortunately we do not want any of these, except the brandy,\" the surgeon said. \"A little of that will do you all good. \"Now a few strips of plaster,\"--this was to Monsieur Teclier, whose face was cut a good deal--\"and then you will do, till you get to the town.\" The three voyagers were now helped into the cart; for they were all very stiff and greatly shaken, and were glad to stretch themselves out on the mattresses, covered over with blankets, until they reached the little town. Here they were met by the whole population, cheering lustily. Another wagon had been sent off for the balloon; and a number of people now set out to search for the bags of dispatches, etc. which had been thrown out during the last part of the descent. The Sous Prefect at the island placed his house at once at their disposal. But they said that they would rather go to a hotel, first, and take a hot bath--which the doctor recommended them--but should be very happy to breakfast with him, after that. Before going to the hotel, however, Monsieur Teclier sent off a dispatch to Tours; saying that he had arrived at Belle Isle with news from Paris, at a quarter to seven; and that, at that time, everything was going on well. He next inquired as to means of reaching the mainland. The wind was dead off shore, and a sailing vessel would have taken a long time to make the passage. However, there was a small steamer in harbor; and the Sous Prefect took upon himself to engage that the fires should be lighted, at once, and that they should cross in two or three hours. After reaching the hotel they were examined carefully by the surgeon; who pronounced that no harm, whatever, had been done to them, and that they had escaped with a few contusions, and a good shaking. The breakfast was quite an ovation. All the principal people of the place were assembled; and when Monsieur Teclier entered, followed by the young Barclays, the gentlemen clapped their hands and cheered, and the ladies waved their handkerchiefs. After breakfast, the Sous Prefect proposed an adjournment into the drawing room; and now the voyagers each became the center of a knot of questioners as to the voyage. Monsieur Teclier--as was natural--conversed with the Sous Prefect and other leading men of the town, while their wives and daughters gathered round the lads. Ralph had given his name as Barclay, and had stated that Percy was his brother; but he had said nothing as to their being in the army, as he wished to avoid the oft-repeated tale which the declaration of his rank was sure to necessitate. He had even said a word to Monsieur Teclier, begging him to say the Messieurs Barclay, instead of Captains Barclay--unless, of course, he were actually questioned upon the matter. Percy was allowed to sit in an easy chair, unmolested--for he was quite done up--and Ralph talked for both, relating many details of their journey from Paris; and the ladies examined him most minutely as to his sensation, and especially whether he was not horribly frightened. Among those standing in a group round the young Barclays was a lieutenant of Mobiles; who evidently by no means approved of the attention, and interest which they excited among the ladies; and who had made several sarcastic remarks, during the course of the narrative. Presently a servant came in and, walking up to Monsieur Teclier, said that two swords had been picked up; had they fallen from the balloon? \"Yes,\" Monsieur Teclier said, \"they belong to those gentlemen.\" The servant came up to Ralph, and told him that the swords had been picked up. Ralph at once drew out a five-franc piece, and asked the servant to give it to the man who had found them. \"Ah,\" said the officer of Mobiles, with a scarcely concealed sneer, \"so you have come out from Paris to serve? I should have imagined that there were plenty of opportunities to distinguish yourselves, there. However, you must have had good interest, to get places in a balloon.\" \"We have fair interest,\" Ralph said calmly, \"as apparently you have, yourself. Each of us have, you see, used our interest in the way most pleasing to us. We have used ours to enable us to go with the army in the field, instead of being forced to remain inactive in Paris. You, upon your part, have used yours to get away from the army in the field, and to remain inactive, here.\" These words were spoken with such an air of boyish frankness, and an apparent innocence of any desire to say anything unpleasant, that everyone within hearing was ready to burst with laughter at Ralph\u0027s hit--which happened to be thoroughly well deserved. The officer turned white; and would have burst out into a violent answer, had not a couple of friends at his elbow begged him to restrain himself. The boy evidently meant nothing; besides, he was only a boy, and what could be done with him? Besides which, again, one of them put in, though he was only a boy, he looked an awkward customer. This latter argument weighed more with the lieutenant than any other. Ralph was not yet seventeen, and looked much younger than a French lad of the same age would do; but in point of size he was considerably taller than the officer of Mobiles, and his broad shoulders gave promise of unusual strength. There was, too, a look of fearlessness and decision about his face which marked him emphatically as an \"awkward customer.\" Seeing this, the lieutenant burst into a constrained fit of laughter; and said that it was \"very good--really very good, for a boy.\" Everyone else was so occupied in the endeavor to stifle their laughter that the lieutenant again took up the part of questioner. \"I suppose, young gentleman, that you come from Saint Cyr or the Polytechnic; although I should hardly imagine that you have completed your studies, in either of them?\" \"I have not the advantage of having been at either of the military academies,\" Ralph said quietly. \"Have you?\" Again there was a laugh and, by this time, most of those in the room had gathered round. \"May I ask to which arm of the service you belong?\" the officer asked, with difficulty keeping his temper. \"You may ask, certainly; and I have no objection to answer,\" Ralph said. \"My brother and myself both belong to the general staff.\" The officer looked surprised. \"Have you served already, sir, or has your service yet to commence?\" \"I have seen some little service already,\" Ralph said. \"May I ask what general has had the benefit of your assistance?\" the lieutenant said, with an affectation of politeness. At this moment the Sous Prefect pushed forward. \"Silence, sir!\" he said to the officer. \"There has been too much of this. These gentlemen have performed a great service to France, and are my guests; and I look upon it as a personal attack upon myself.\" \"Excuse me, sir,\" Ralph said, rising from his seat for the first time. \"I am grateful to you, for your interference in my behalf; but I can make no claim, upon the present occasion, to have rendered any service to France. I had nothing to do with the dispatches, nothing to do with the balloon. I came out as a passenger, upon my private desire and pleasure, at the risk of course of being killed. Undoubtedly I nearly was killed; and I look upon the entertainment that you have given us as a kind congratulation upon our not having broken our necks. \"Kindly, then, permit me to answer this officer for myself. I think I can hold my own.\" The Sous Prefect shrugged his shoulders; to signify that, in that case, he washed his hands of the whole business. \"Now, sir,\" Ralph said, \"I will answer the question. The general upon whose staff my brother and myself served was General Cambriels.\" The officer shrugged his shoulders. \"Since that time,\" Ralph said, more sternly than he had yet spoken, \"my brother and myself have had the offer of posts upon the staffs of General Trochu, General Ducrot, and General Vinoy.\" \"Oh, come now,\" the lieutenant said, with a laugh of derision, \"that is a little too strong. Imagine a scramble upon the part of Trochu, Ducrot, and Vinoy for the services of these very young officers.\" This time the speaker had the laugh with him, for no one could believe that Ralph could be speaking the truth. Ralph grew a little pale. \"Monsieur Teclier,\" he said, \"do me the favor to introduce my brother and myself to this lieutenant of Mobiles, in due form.\" The matter had now become so serious that there was a dead hush in the room, while Monsieur Teclier advanced. He had once or twice already made a motion of coming forward, to take Ralph\u0027s part; but a motion from the latter had arrested him. He was aware of the furore which the gallant and successful expedition of the Barclays had created, in Paris; and he had been greatly struck and pleased by the calmness of the boys in a great--and to them altogether new--peril. He now advanced slowly. \"May I ask your name, sir, and regiment?\" he said to the officer. \"Lieutenant Desmaret, of the Mobiles of Vienne,\" the officer said, frowning. \"Lieutenant Desmaret of the Mobiles of Vienne, I beg to introduce you to--\" \"No, sir,\" the officer said, passionately, \"you introduce them to me, not me to them. The inferior rank is introduced to the superior.\" \"I know perfectly well what I am doing, sir, and require no lesson from you,\" Monsieur Teclier said, quietly. \"I repeat, I introduce you--Lieutenant Desmaret, of the Mobiles of Vienne--to Captain Ralph Barclay, and Captain Percy Barclay, staff officers, and commanders of the legion of honor.\" There was a dead silence of surprise throughout the room. \"Is it possible?\" the Sous Prefect said, coming forward again, \"that these gentlemen are the Captains Barclay, of whom the Paris papers--which we received three days since--were full, as having passed through the German lines, and having swam the Seine at night, under fire? They had previously been decorated for great acts of bravery, in the Vosges; and were now made commanders of the Legion. \"Is it possible that you are those officers, gentlemen?\" \"It is so, monsieur,\" Ralph said. \"We had the good fortune to distinguish ourselves but, as we did not wish to make ourselves conspicuous by new uniforms, and new ribbons, we have put aside our uniforms until required for service; and asked Monsieur Teclier to be silent upon the subject. Of course, we could not guess that, upon our way, we should meet so rude and unmannerly a person as Monsieur the Lieutenant of the Mobiles of Vienne.\" The lieutenant stamped his feet furiously. \"You shall answer to me, sir,\" he said, \"for this insult.\" \"Stop, sir,\" Ralph said, in a steady voice--which silenced those who were about to interfere. \"You have asked me questions, with rare freedom. I have answered them. I am now going to give you my opinion of you, and my advice to you, equally freely. \"If you mean, by what you have said, that you are going to challenge me to a duel, I tell you at once that I shall not accept it. I have, sir,\" and he raised his head proudly, \"proved my courage; and France has recognized it, in the rank and honor she has given me. We English--for I am English--do not fight duels. \"But I will make an exception. When you, Monsieur Desmaret, come to me decorated as I am; or having, in any signal way, proved your courage and devotion to France, I will meet you. At present I see that you--an officer in the French army, well in health--are staying here in idleness, instead of being in the field. Go and fight the enemies of France, first, Monsieur Desmaret; and after that talk, if you like, about fighting her friends.\" There was a loud exclamation of applause and satisfaction, at these words, from those who had been looking on at this unpleasant scene; and the Sous Prefect warmly shook Ralph by the hand. \"Well said, Captain Barclay; well said, indeed. I believe I may say that everyone here agrees with you, entirely. There are too many officers continually absent from the army upon \u0027private affairs;\u0027 and those of Monsieur Desmaret have taken longer to arrange than usual, for he has been staying here for five weeks now. \"However,\" he said, significantly, \"he will hardly prolong his stay in the island. \"Enough upon that subject,\" he said, as Monsieur Desmaret left the room, pale and furious. \"I am glad--I am proud, sir--to make the acquaintance of yourself and your brother; and I can really, at heart, feel grateful to that fellow, for having forced you to declare who you are. Had he not done so, you would have left without our knowing that we had you among us.\" There was now quite an ovation to the boys. The ladies, especially, would hardly conceive that it was possible that these quiet-looking young fellows had performed feats of such daring. They now begged to hear the details of the adventures but, at this moment, word was brought that steam was up, and the vessel ready to start; and as Monsieur Teclier was most anxious to get on, and as Percy was quite done up, Ralph was glad to seize the excuse, and to make his apologies for leaving at once. The Sous Prefect, all the breakfast party, and a large proportion of the population of the little place accompanied them thence to the landing place; and then, amidst hearty cheering, the little steamer--carrying the voyagers, the dispatches, and the remains of the balloon--started for the mainland. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3162/86793.html","bookId":872,"book":{"id":872,"title":"The Young Franc Tireurs","description":"简介： The usually quiet old town of Dijon was in a state of excitement.
