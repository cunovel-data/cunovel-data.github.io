{"id":10629,"no":19,"title":"Chapter 18: A Day Of Victory.","content":"After traveling all night, the Barclays arrived at Tours at ten o\u0027clock, on the morning of the day after that upon which they had left Belle Isle. At the station they said adieu to Monsieur Teclier; who went at once to Gambetta, with the dispatches; while the Barclays turned away to Colonel Tempe\u0027s lodgings and, to their great surprise as well as delight, found him in. The colonel gave quite a shout of joy, when he saw them. \"Ah, my brave boys, my brave boys, I am glad to see you,\" and he took them in his arms, and kissed them as heartily and as earnestly as if he had been their father. \"I am glad to see you,\" he repeated, wiping his eyes with his handkerchief. \"I was sure you would do it. I never really doubted--I told Gambetta it was as good as done--but I could not help being nervous, horribly nervous; and when the news came, five days ago, by the balloon which left three days after you got in, I almost lost my head. I laughed, I cheered, I shook everyone by the hand--ma foi, I don\u0027t know what I did, I was so pleased. \"Your Irishman was the funniest thing. He was not surprised, or pleased, or even interested. I explained to him over and over again, thinking he did not understand; but he only shook his head and said, in his strange English: \"\u0027Sure, colonel, I never doubted them for a moment. Aren\u0027t they clever enough to decaive the ould gintleman, himself? It was as sartin as peas is peas that they would slip in, somehow; and if they did get into a scrape, that they were the boys for getting themselves out of it. It\u0027s the coming out I am afraid of.\u0027 \"I looked surprised, naturally enough, and he went on: \"\u0027And doesn\u0027t your honor know that they are talking of coming out in a balloon? Only to think of it, colonel, flying through the clouds, shut up in a big ball of silk! It\u0027s just flying in the face of Providence. What\u0027s the use of scheming, or of courage? You can\u0027t decaive a cloud, though it\u0027s as aisy as dancing to take in a German. When you tell me, colonel, that they\u0027re safe out of the balloon; then I\u0027ll shout, as loud as you like.\u0027 \"Yesterday, when the telegram from Teclier came--saying that he had fallen in Belle Isle, had had a narrow escape of being driven into the sea, but had avoided that by running the risk of breaking his neck--and mentioned that you were with him; and had, like himself, escaped with a few bruises, Tim went nearly out of his mind with joy. He has been cleaning his sword and accouterments, this morning. \"I am off tomorrow, and you are only just come in time to see the fighting. \"But you are looking ill, Percy; far too ill for service, just at present.\" \"Yes, he has been very ill,\" Ralph said. \"He had a touch of brain fever, the night we got into Paris; and was delirious for two days. He has picked up quickly, but that balloon descent was not the thing for an invalid. The doctor in Paris ordered a month, at least, of absolute rest; and has given him a sick certificate.\" \"He needs rest, certainly,\" Colonel Tempe said, \"but he cannot go home, at present. The Prussians hold Dijon in considerable strength. There are far too many people in the town who have heard of your connection with the franc tireurs. Some spy or other would be certain to peach.\" \"Yes,\" Ralph assented, \"we have been talking it over, and quite agree that Percy could not go back as--although he would willingly run the risk, himself--it would bring such serious consequences upon them at home, if he were found there, that he has determined to go down to Nice for a while, and rejoin as soon as he gains strength again.\" \"Yes,\" Colonel Tempe said, \"but above all things, do not let him be in a hurry. \"You have gone through an immense deal, Percy; and have done a great deal more than your share for France, and have gained great honor and credit. Be content with that. You might ruin your constitution for life, by further exertions.\" \"But about yourself colonel, where are you going?\" \"I am starting, tomorrow, to join General Chanzy\u0027s staff.\" \"I have not heard his name before,\" Ralph said. \"He commands the Sixteenth Corps. He has not had much opportunity yet, but he is a good soldier. If you like, Ralph, I will go with you at once, to Freysinet, and get you attached with me.\" \"Thank you very much, colonel. I should like it of all things.\" \"Come along, then; Freysinet is in his office.\" Percy accompanied them, to obtain a signature to his leave of absence, and left next day for the south. An hour later, Colonel Tempe and Ralph were in the train, upon their way to Orleans--Tim, again in his hussar uniform, and half wild with delight--being, with Colonel Tempe\u0027s orderly, in charge of the horses. Colonel Tempe, as Ralph was not mounted, had offered to lend him one of his own; but Ralph had refused it, unless the colonel would sell it, as he said he should be always afraid of getting the animal shot, unless it was his own. Seeing that Ralph was determined upon this score, the colonel had reluctantly agreed to take the sum he had paid for the horse. Ralph\u0027s only other purchase in Tours was a fur greatcoat. \"And now, colonel,\" Ralph said, when the train had started, \"we have time to talk--tell me, what chances have we of success?\" \"Between ourselves, Barclay,\" Colonel Tempe said, \"I do not think that our prospects are brilliant. In my opinion, Aurelles de Paladine--or rather Gambetta, for it was he who ordered the advance--made an immense mistake in attacking Von der Tann when he did. Of course, he drove him back, and took Orleans; but what was the use of that? Absolutely nothing. He was not strong enough to push his advantage; but the movement served to draw the attention of the Germans to his force, and Prince Frederick Charles--who was marching south from Metz--has been hurried towards Orleans, and has now united his forces with those of Von der Tann and the Duke of Mecklenburg; so that, although we have received large reinforcements--for the whole of the army of the east is up, now--the Germans have been equally reinforced, and are quite as strong as we are. \"We ought never to have attacked, until we were ready to follow up our advantage at once. It was nothing short of madness; yet what can you expect, with a civilian acting as commander-in-chief? I believe that we shall make a tough fight of it, but I can hardly hope that our new levies can prove a match for the veterans of Frederick Charles.\" \"When do we begin, do you think?\" \"In two or three days at latest. You have not seen a great battle yet, Barclay.\" \"No,\" Ralph said, \"nor shall I see much of it, now; for the country is so perfectly flat that it will be impossible to get anything like a general view of it. Do you know, colonel, I feel a good deal more comfortable than I did during my last journey between Tours and Orleans; for although I thought that we should manage, somehow, to get through into Paris; still, I could not conceal from myself that it was a very serious undertaking. \"How bitterly cold it is.\" \"It is, indeed,\" Colonel Tempe assented. \"Being upon the staff we shall, no doubt, manage to get a roof of some sort over our heads; but for the sentries it must be terrible. The tents d\u0027abri--if the men can scrape away the snow, and get an armful of straw to lie on--are snug enough; the men lie close together, and share their blankets.\" Half an hour after arriving at Orleans, Colonel Tempe and Ralph were riding out upon the north road; followed by Tim Doyle, and the colonel\u0027s orderly. The frost was keen, but the afternoon was bright and clear; and as they cantered along the road--beaten flat and hard, with the enormous traffic--their spirits rose, and Ralph regretted that Percy was not there to share in his enjoyments. Colonel Tempe shook his head when the wish was mentioned. \"No, no, Barclay, it is far better as it is. You are young enough, in all conscience, for this iron work of war; your brother has done far more than a man\u0027s share already, and will find it difficult enough to go back as a schoolboy. He has escaped thus far, almost by a miracle; but he was looking shaken, and worn. I am glad that he is not here.\" Three hours\u0027 riding took them to the little village near which General Chanzy was quartered. The Sixteenth Corps lay to the left of the French army, facing the Germans; who held the line of villages of Guillonville, Terminiers, and Conier. It was already dark when they arrived. The general\u0027s quarters were in a chateau, a quarter of a mile distant from the village. When they reached it, they were at once shown in; and found General Chanzy leaning over a map, which he was trying to examine by the light of a solitary candle. \"How are you, colonel?\" he asked, shaking hands with him heartily--for they were old friends. \"I am very glad you have come. There is plenty to do, and few to do it; at least, very few indeed who know anything about their work. \"Who have you here?\" \"Allow me to introduce Captain Barclay, general. Freysinet has attached him to your staff. He served with me in the Vosges, distinguished himself greatly, and won his lieutenancy and the Cross. Since then he has been into Paris. No doubt you saw the account of his swimming the Seine, with his brother.\" \"Of course, of course,\" General Chanzy said, warmly. \"I am very glad to have you with me, Captain Barclay. You will not be long before you are at work, for the affair is just beginning. I have just got news that there has been some sharp fighting, today, at Beaurre la Rolande.\" \"With what results, sir?\" Colonel Tempe asked. \"We gained a great deal of ground, in the morning,\" General Chanzy said; \"but they brought up reinforcements, and no material advantage is claimed. \"And now,\" the general went on, \"as to quarters, you must shift for yourselves. Beds are out of the question; but you will find some empty rooms upstairs and, fortunately, there is a little straw in the stable. The outhouses are extensive, and you will be able to get your horses under shelter. I should advise you to see about them, at once. In an hour we shall have something to eat. I cannot call it dining. \"Captain Barclay, will you kindly see to these matters? I shall be glad to go through this map, at once, with Colonel Tempe.\" Ralph at once obeyed the order, much pleased with his new commander. General Chanzy was a man to inspire confidence in all those who served under his orders. He was a young man, for a general; but was very bald, and had a quiet and thoughtful air which made him look older than he was. He was a man of few words; and had a sharp, steady look which seemed to master, at once, the important points of anything that was said to him. When he smiled, the whole of his face seemed to light up. \"Just the man to serve under,\" Ralph thought to himself. \"Cool, self possessed, and with an eye that will see a weak point in a moment. \"Is my orderly still at the door?\" he asked a soldier in the passage. \"Yes, sir; two orderlies, with the four horses.\" \"Can you get me a light of any sort?\" Ralph asked. \"I want to go round to the stables, and get the horses somewhere in shelter.\" \"I will get you a lantern, sir,\" the man said. \"But I fear that you will find the place all crowded; but of course, you can turn some of them out.\" The orderly accompanied Ralph, with a lantern, across the yard; Tim and Colonel Tempe\u0027s orderly following. Round the yard were many cavalry horses, tied to pegs; driven in close by the wall of the stables, so as to give them some little shelter from the intense cold. The poor animals stood, side touching side, for warmth. The orderly opened the door of one of the stables; and Ralph entered, and looked round by the light of the lantern. The horses were ranged together in the stalls, as closely as they could stand; while the rest of the area was completely covered with cavalry soldiers, some sitting up smoking and talking, others already wrapped in their cloaks and stretched at full length. A sergeant, seeing the marks of Ralph\u0027s rank, at once rose to his feet and saluted. \"I have two horses here, sergeant; my own, and one of Colonel Tempe\u0027s. General Chanzy told me I should find room here, but it does not look like it.\" \"I will turn two of these horses out, sir,\" the sergeant said. \"Is there no other place?\" Ralph asked. \"They are all as full as this, sir.\" \"There is a little shed, down at the end of the garden,\" one of the men said. \"I noticed it this afternoon. The door was locked. I looked in, and it seemed a cow shed. I don\u0027t know whether anyone is there. I will go down with you, sir, and show you the way, if you like.\" The shed was soon found, and the soldier forced the door open with his sword bayonet. The place had, as he supposed, been a cow shed; but the walls and roof were in good order, and the ground hard. \"This will do first rate, your honor,\" Tim said. \"There is room for all four horses, if they squeeze a bit; and for Jacques here, and myself. I suppose, your honor, there will be no harm in knocking up some of this woodwork, to make a bit of a fire? It\u0027s too dark to look for sticks, tonight; and they would be so damp, from the snow, that the smoke would choke the bastes entirely--to say nothing of us.\" \"Well, under the circumstances, Tim, I agree with you; but don\u0027t do more damage than you can help, and only make enough fire to make the water hot for coffee, and so on. You will be warm enough, here, with the four horses. You must go and see if you can get them some forage.\" \"But how about your honor\u0027s and the colonel\u0027s dinner?\" Tim asked. \"I haven\u0027t drawn rations; but I have got plenty of bread and meat, in the haversack. I got them at Tours, for I thought there wouldn\u0027t be much to be had here.\" \"Thank you for thinking of it, Tim, but we dine with the general. When you have got the horses comfortable, and lit your fire, one of you bring up our cloaks to the house. Keep the horses\u0027 saddles on, with loosened girths. We may want them suddenly, at any moment of the night.\" The next morning, General Chanzy said to Ralph: \"I should recommend you, Captain Barclay, to spend an hour studying this map; and getting up, from these lists, the exact position of our forces. When you think you have mastered them, ride through the whole of the positions occupied by the corps and, without exposing yourself, gain as good an idea as you can of the country beyond. Tomorrow you may have to ride straight to certain points, with orders; and it may save important time if you are thoroughly acquainted with the ground, and position.\" After a couple of hours\u0027 study of the staff map, so as to know every little by-lane and hamlet, for ten miles on either side, Ralph mounted his horse and went for a long ride. When he returned, Colonel Tempe told him that General Chanzy was gone over to General D\u0027Aurelle\u0027s quarters, to arrange the details; and that the attack was to take place the next day. At five o\u0027clock the general returned; and Colonel Tempe and the chief of his staff were occupied with him, for two hours, in drawing up the specific orders for each corps. Colonel Tempe had not been out, all day; and he therefore offered his horse to Ralph, in order that Ralph\u0027s own might be fresh for the next day. Four staff officers set off in various directions with the dispatches; and Ralph congratulated himself upon having been upon the ground he was now traversing once before that day as, even with that previous acquaintance, it was hard work to find the way through the darkness, from the snow altering the general appearance and apparent distance of each object. Thanks, however, to his ride of the morning, he reached the various corps to which he was dispatched without any serious mistakes in his way; and got back to headquarters by eleven o\u0027clock. Tim was waiting up for him. \"Sure, your honor, and it\u0027s a mighty cold night. I\u0027ve got a pot of coffee on the boil in the stables.\" \"Thank you, Tim. I will just go in and make my report to the general, and then go off to bed. Bring the coffee into my room. We shall be up early, for we fight tomorrow.\" \"Do we, now?\" Tim said, admiringly. \"And it\u0027s about time; for we should be all frozen into skeletons, if we were to wait here doing nothing much longer. Bad luck to the weather, says I.\" At ten o\u0027clock the next morning the French troops were in motion, the objects of their attack being the villages of Guillonville, Terminiers, and Conier. The country was extremely flat and, for an hour, they saw no bodies of the enemy. A few videttes, only, were seen. These galloped off hastily, the moment they caught sight of the heavy masses of the French debouching from the wood. Ralph was riding, with the rest of the staff, behind the general. \"That is Terminiers,\" Colonel Tempe said, pointing to a house or two at a distance, on the plain. As he spoke, a puff of smoke came from the houses. \"There is the first shell,\" was the general exclamation. In another instant the missile burst near some infantry, at two hundred yards to the right. \"Take orders to that battery, there, to take position on that little eminence to the left there, Captain Barclay. Tell them to keep the guns a little back among the trees, and to open sharply upon Terminiers.\" It was just twelve o\u0027clock now and, in five minutes, there was a roar of cannon along the whole length of both lines. For half an hour the combat continued a mere artillery duel. The shells fell in all directions; cutting the dry branches from the trees, tearing up the ground, and leaving deep black gashes in the white snow; crashing through a wall or, occasionally, exploding among the troops. \"Their fire is slackening a little,\" General Chanzy said. \"It is time to be pushing forward. \"Lieutenant Porcet, take my orders to the colonel of that regiment of Mobiles to advance at once, covered by skirmishers. \"Captain Barclay, order that Line regiment to support. \"Captain Maillot, order the artillery to concentrate their fire upon the village, and to advance by batteries.\" The orders were carried out, and the Mobiles advanced to within five hundred yards of the village. The musketry fire was now tremendous, and the Mobiles wavered. The Germans were entrenched in the gardens and walled enclosures of the village. Every wall, every house was loopholed; and rough barricades had been erected, to fill up the breaks in the walls. General Chanzy was sitting on horseback, a short distance in the rear of the fighting. Mounted officers rode up and left again, every moment, with news of the battle going on near the other villages. \"Ride up and order the Mobiles to lie down, Captain Barclay; then tell the colonel of the Line to bring his troops up in line with them. Let them lie down, also. \"Tempe, have the two reserve batteries of artillery brought up, at full speed, to silence that battery in the wood to the left of the village. Its fire crosses the ground we have to pass over.\" Ten minutes more of continuous cannonading, and then it was apparent that the Prussian fire was weakening. \"Now, Barclay, tell them to charge, at the double.\" Ralph set spurs to his horse but, just as he reached the troops, a shell exploded just under his horse. Ralph heard a crash; felt a shock, and a whirling through the air; and then fell heavily upon the ground. Believing he was dangerously wounded, he made no effort to get to his feet; but sat up and shouted to the colonel of the Mobiles, who were not thirty yards from him: \"The Mobiles and Line are to charge, at the double, and to carry the village with the bayonet.\" The Mobiles had flinched a little before, as they had advanced with the deadly fire of shot and shell; but they did not flinch now, and leaping upon their feet, with a cry of \"Vive la France!\" the Mobiles and Line soldiers literally made a race of it for the village. Ralph, after having given his message, lay back again, with a sort of bewildered sensation. A minute afterwards he heard a rapid galloping; and Colonel Tempe rode up, followed by Tim Doyle. \"Are you badly hurt, my dear boy?\" the former exclaimed, as he leaped from his horse. \"The general himself asked me to come, and see after you.\" \"I don\u0027t quite know, colonel,\" Ralph answered. \"I feel, at present, as if my head was knocked in, and my legs shot off.\" \"You had a tremendous shake,\" said Colonel Tempe--who was, with Tim, by this time kneeling beside him--\"and your horse is blown almost to pieces; but I don\u0027t think, as far as I can see, at present, that you are hit anywhere. Here, take a sip of brandy. It will bring you round; you are stunned a little, you know. \"There, you are better now,\" he said; as Ralph, having drunk a little brandy, sat up and looked round. \"I am all right, I think, colonel; don\u0027t stay any longer. Tim will wait here. I don\u0027t think I was stunned, else I could not have given the order. No, I imagine I had a near escape of breaking my neck. \"Please, don\u0027t wait. I shall be all right again, in five minutes. I will take Tim\u0027s horse, and join you again. Tim will pick up a musket--there are plenty about--and do a little fighting on his own account.\" Colonel Tempe jumped on his horse, and rode off. In a minute or two, Ralph was able to mount Tim\u0027s horse, and ride slowly up to the village, where a heavy musketry fire was still going on; but as no shell or shot were now coming in the direction in which Ralph was, it was evident that the French had taken the position, and had opened fire upon the retreating Germans. The fight still raged, both to the right and left; but in another quarter of an hour it slackened also, here, and the three villages were all in the hands of the French. In a quarter of an hour, Ralph felt quite himself again and, seeing one of his fellow staff officers gallop up, he asked him where he could find the general. \"He is at Guillonville. But he will be here, in a few minutes. The advance is to continue. We are to carry the villages of Monneville, Villepani, and Faverolles.\" In half an hour, the troops were again moved forward; but this time the resistance was more obstinate than before, the Prussians having received reinforcements. Hour after hour the fight continued. The short winter day faded, and the gathering darkness was favorable to the assailants and, at half-past five, they carried the villages by assault. The scene was a wild one. It was perfectly dark, save from the incessant flashes of rifle and cannon. In the streets of the village men fought, hand to hand. Some of the Germans, taking refuge in the houses, refused to surrender. Others threw down their arms, and cried for quarter. Shouts, screams, curses, cheers, the explosion of firearms and the clash of steel mingled, in one wild and confusing din. When it ceased, the village remained in the hands of the French; and the Prussians retreated, sullenly, into the darkness. There was no rest for the staff, for hours--they were galloping about, carrying orders--but at last Ralph returned to Villepani, at which village General Chanzy had his headquarters. At the door of the cottage which was pointed out, as that in which the general was, Tim was waiting. \"Faith, your honor, if this is war, I\u0027ve had enough of it.\" \"What is it, Tim?\" \"What is it, your honor! Here have we been fighting all day, and not a blessed thing to eat or to drink. No one knows what became of the wagons; and here we are, without as much as a biscuit to ate--and in such weather as this, too; and another battle in the morning.\" \"Ay, Tim, it\u0027s bad enough, but think of the thousands of poor fellows lying wounded, and freezing to death, on the snow.\" \"I do think of them, Mister Ralph; and I\u0027ve been at work, ever since we got in here, carrying the poor creatures in from the gardens and fields. There is not a house here that\u0027s not full, from the top to the bottom. \"Have you lost the wallet off my saddle, your honor?\" \"No, Tim; why should I do that?\" \"I don\u0027t know why you should, sir, but I have been making up my mind that you would, all along; either that you would have had it shot off, or that you\u0027d throw it away to aise the horse. Now, we shall do.\" \"Why, what\u0027s in the wallet, Tim?\" \"Just a big chunk of bread, your honor It was left on the table when you had breakfast, this morning; and I said to myself, it may be useful before night, and so just slipped it into the wallet.\" In another minute the bread was taken out, and cut into two portions. \"I would not eat it all tonight, Tim, if I were you,\" Ralph said. \"It is not by any means too large for supper, but a mouthful in the morning will be a great comfort. I suppose there is no chance of getting anything for the horse?\" \"Trust me, your honor One of the first things I did, when the firing was over, was to pop into a stable and to get a big armful of hay; and take it out and hide it away, under a hedge. It was lucky I did; for the minute afterwards we could not have got a handful, if we had offered a Napoleon for it.\" \"Where are you going to sleep, Tim?\" \"Under that same hedge, Mister Ralph. The horse always lies down; and he\u0027s so tired he won\u0027t break the rule, tonight; so I\u0027ll give him half the hay for his supper and, when he\u0027s laid down, I\u0027ll put the rest between him and the hedge, and roll myself up in my cloak and--what with the cloak, and the horse, and the hedge, and the hay, not to mention the supper--I shall be as warm as a lord; and it\u0027s a comfort to think that there will be something to eat, both for the baste and myself, in the morning.\" \"Well, good night then, Tim.\" \"Good night, your honor.\" If Tim Doyle slept, there were not many of his comrades that did, on that night. The cold was fierce, in the extreme; and those who could obtain wood of any kind made fires, and crouched over them. Others lay on the ground, and huddled together for warmth. Others dragged their feet wearily backwards and forwards. Many and deep were the curses poured out upon the intendance--or commissariat--whose utter incompetence, throughout the war, was one of the great reasons of the continuous bad fortune of the French. When Ralph entered the room, he was saluted by a variety of voices. The only light was a dim lantern. The room was half full of officers; some dozing in corners, others sitting round the table, smoking. \"Where is the general?\" \"He has got a room, about half the size of this, for the use of himself, Tempe, and the chief of the staff. They are writing; and will go on writing all night, I expect. These are the only two rooms not full of wounded in the whole village. \"You had a narrow escape, today. We have had our share of casualties. Poor Maillet and Porcet are both killed, and we have three wounded. Were you hurt at all?\" \"No,\" Ralph said; \"but I was tremendously shaken, and feel stiff all over. I will lie down by the wall, here, and get a few hours\u0027 sleep.\" And so ended the 1st of December.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3162/86794.html","bookId":872,"book":{"id":872,"title":"The Young Franc Tireurs","description":"简介： The usually quiet old town of Dijon was in a state of excitement.
