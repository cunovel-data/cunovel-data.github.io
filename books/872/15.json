{"id":10625,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 14: A Perilous Expedition.","content":"Upon the eleventh of November the boys arrived at Tours. They had started for that place, as the national headquarters, the moment they arrived at Cherbourg. At Tours men\u0027s hopes were high for, a week before, Aurelles de Paladine had driven back Von der Tann, and reoccupied Orleans. Every hour fresh troops were arriving, and passing forwards. The town was literally thronged with soldiers, of all sorts: batteries of artillery, regiments of cavalry, squadrons of Arab Spahis--looking strangely out of place in their white robes, and unmoved countenance, in this scene of European warfare--franc tireurs, in every possible variety of absurd and unsuitable uniform. In all this din and confusion, the young Barclays felt quite bewildered. The first thing was, evidently, to get new uniforms; then to report themselves. There was no difficulty about the former matter, for every tailor in Tours had, for the time being, turned military outfitter and, by dint of offering to pay extra, their uniforms were promised for the next morning. That matter settled, they determined to go at once to the Prefecture, and report themselves. As they turned out of the crowded Rue Royal, they received two hearty slaps on the shoulder, which almost knocked them down; while a hearty voice exclaimed: \"My dear boys, I am glad to see you!\" They looked round and--to their astonishment and delight--saw Colonel Tempe. For a minute or two, the hand shakings and greetings were so hearty that no questions could be asked. \"I thought a German prison would not hold you long, boys,\" the colonel said. \"I saw your father, as I came through Dijon; and I said to him that I should be surprised if you did not turn up soon, especially when I heard from him that you were at Mayence, only two days\u0027 tramp from the frontier.\" \"But what are you doing here, colonel?\" \"Just at present, I am working at headquarters. Between ourselves, the army of the east is coming round to join Aurelles. Our poor fellows were pretty nearly used up, and I found that I could do little real good with the other corps. So I gave up the command; and was sent here to confer with Gambetta, and he has kept me. \"Now, what are you going to do?\" \"We were going to report ourselves, colonel.\" \"No use going today--too late. Come and dine with me, at the Bordeaux. Have you got rooms?\" \"Not yet, colonel.\" \"Then I can tell you you won\u0027t get them, at all. The place is crowded--not a bed to be had, for love or money. I\u0027ve got rooms, by the greatest good luck. One of you can have the sofa; the other an armchair, or the hearth rug, whichever suits you best.\" \"Thank you, very much; we shall do capitally,\" the boys said. \"And now, have you any news from Paris?\" \"We have no late news from Paris but, worse still, the news gets very slowly and irregularly into Paris. The pigeons seem to get bewildered with the snow, or else the Prussians shoot them.\" \"But surely, with such an immense circle to guard, there could be no great difficulty in a messenger finding his way in?\" \"There is a difficulty, and a very great one,\" Colonel Tempe said; \"for of all who have tried, only one or two have succeeded. Now come along, or we shall be late for dinner.\" It was a curious medley at the table d\u0027hote, at the Hotel de Bordeaux. Generals, with their breasts covered with orders, and simple franc tireurs; officers, of every arm of the service; ministers and members of the late Corps Legislatif; an American gentleman, with his family; English newspaper correspondents; army contractors; and families, refugees from Paris. After dinner they went to a cafe--literally crowded with officers--and thence to Colonel Tempe\u0027s rooms, where they sat down quietly, to chat over what had taken place since the last visit. \"But where is your Irishman? Your father told me he was with you. I suppose you could not get him out.\" \"Oh yes, Tim\u0027s here,\" Ralph said, laughing, \"but he ran across a couple of Irishmen belonging to the foreign legion and--as he would have been in our way, and we did not know where we were going to sleep--we gave him leave till to-morrow morning, when he is to meet us in front of the railway station.\" \"By the way, boys, I suppose you know you have each got a step?\" \"No,\" the boys cried. \"Really?\" \"Yes, really,\" the colonel said. \"That good fellow, Cambriels, sent in a strong report in your favor upon resigning his command; rehearsing what you did with us, and requesting that the step might be at once given to you. As a matter of course it was, in the next Gazette.\" \"Of course, we feel pleased, colonel; but it seems absurd, so young as we are. Why, if we go on like this, in another six months we may be majors.\" \"In ordinary times it would be absurd, lads; and it would not be possible for you to hold the grade you do now--still less higher ones--unless you understood thoroughly your duty. At the present moment, everything is exceptional. A man who, perhaps, only served a few months in the army, years ago, is made a general, and sent to organize a camp of new levies. Of course, he could not command these troops in the field, could not even drill them on the parade ground. But that is of no matter. He has a talent for organization, and therefore is selected to organize the camp and, to enable him to do so efficiently, he receives the nominal rank of general. \"In ordinary times a man could not get promoted--three or even four times, in as many weeks--over the heads of hundreds of others, without causing an immense amount of jealousy; without, in fact, upsetting the whole traditions of the army. \"Now, it is altogether different. The officers of the regular army are almost all prisoners. Everyone is new, everyone is unaccustomed to his work; and men who show themselves to be good men can be rewarded and promoted with exceptional rapidity, without exciting any feeling of jealousy, whatever. Besides which, the whole thing is provisional. When the war is over, everyone will either go back into private life or, if they continue to serve, will be gazetted into the regular army, according to some scale or other to be hereafter determined upon. Some inconveniences no doubt will arise, but they will hardly be serious. \"I was offered a general\u0027s rank, a month ago; but I declined it, as it would have entailed either my undertaking duties for which I am unfit; or setting to, to organize young levies, and giving up active service. \"No, if you go on as you have hitherto done, boys, you may be colonels in another six months; for when a name is recommended for promotion for good service, by a general, you may well suppose there is no question asked as to his age. Of course, no general would recommend you as captains to command companies in a regiment, because you are altogether ignorant of a captain\u0027s duty; but you are quite capable of filling the duties of captain, on the staff, as those duties require only clear headedness, pluck, attention, and common sense. \"What I should like to win, even more than a company--were I in your place--would be a commander\u0027s cross in the legion of honor. I had the cross, years ago; but I only had the commander\u0027s cross a fortnight ago, for the Bridge of Vesouze.\" \"Ah, yes,\" Ralph said, \"that would be worth winning, but that is hopeless.\" Colonel Tempe was silent. Ralph and Percy looked at him. \"You mean,\" Ralph said, after a pause, \"that there is a chance of our winning it.\" \"Well, boys,\" Colonel Tempe said, \"I don\u0027t know that I am right in leading you into danger, but I do think that you might win it. I was mentioning your names, only yesterday, to Gambetta. A dispatch had just come in from Paris, grumbling at receiving no news from the country; and Gambetta was lamenting over the impossibility of arranging for simultaneous movements, owing to the breakdown of the pigeons, and the failure of the messengers; when I said: \"\u0027There were two young English fellows with us, in the Vosges--they were on Cambriels\u0027 staff last, and are now prisoners--who if they were here would, I believe, get in if anyone could. They went down, over and over again, among the Germans; and I could lay any money that they would succeed.\u0027 \"\u0027How did they get taken prisoners?\u0027 Gambetta asked, as sharp as a knife. \"\u0027By no fault of their own,\u0027 I answered. \u0027They went out on leave, to see me; and slept with a party of franc tireurs--where they of course had no authority, as to sentries--and the party was surprised, at night, and completely cut up. They were taken prisoners, but I do not expect that they will remain so for long.\u0027 \"Gambetta did not say anything, then; but when I left him, an hour afterwards, he remarked: \"\u0027If you hear of those young fellows you were speaking of having returned, send them to me, Tempe.\u0027\" Ralph looked at Percy, and checked the offer to go which he saw was on his brother\u0027s lips. \"I think it might be done, colonel,\" he said, quietly; \"but it is a serious matter, and we will think it over, before we give an opinion.\" Ralph then changed the subject, and they talked over the events which had happened in the Vosges, the strategy and maneuvers of General Michel, the arrival of Garibaldi, the doings of the franc tireurs, etc. \"By the way,\" the colonel said, \"there was a telegram in, this evening--just as I left the office--that the Germans occupied Dijon, yesterday.\" \"You don\u0027t say so!\" the boys said, jumping from their seats. \"Was there any fighting?\" \"Yes, some Mobiles and franc tireurs made a very plucky defense, outside the town. Owing to some gross mismanagement, the great bulk of the troops had been withdrawn, only the day before. After two or three hours\u0027 fighting, our men fell back; the Prussians, as usual, shelled the town; and the authorities surrendered.\" \"The fighting could not have been our side of the town,\" Ralph said, thoughtfully. \"No, just the other side,\" Colonel Tempe said. \"As my wife is still at home, and our place is not many hundred yards from yours, that was the first thing I thought of.\" \"I wonder if papa was in the fight?\" Percy said, anxiously. \"I should think it probable, boys, that my old friend would have gone out; but I do not think that you need be uneasy about it for, from what the telegram said, our loss was small. The troops fell back into the town, and retreated unmolested through it. So your father would, no doubt, have changed his things in the town, and have walked quietly back again. \"He had volunteered into the national guard, when I came last through Dijon; and was hard at work, drilling them. Of course, he had his old rank of captain.\" At ten o\u0027clock the boys said that they would go for a stroll, before lying down for the night. They were out upwards of an hour; and returned, at the end of that time, with serious but resolved faces. The colonel was out, when they returned; and found them stretched on the sofa and hearth rug, when he came in. They gave him a sleepy good night, and no other word was exchanged. In the morning, they were up at eight o\u0027clock. Colonel Tempe was already dressed, and they went out together to get their coffee and milk. As they were taking it, Ralph told him that they had made up their minds to make the attempt to enter Paris, with dispatches; but that they saw but one way to do so; and that, unless they could be furnished with the necessary papers, they should abandon all idea of the enterprise. Ten minutes later, they entered the Prefecture. Colonel Tempe went in at once to see Gambetta, while the boys remained in the anteroom. In ten minutes their friend came out again, and beckoned to them to come into the next room. \"These are the Lieutenants Barclay,\" he said. The boys bowed; and examined, with attentive curiosity, the man who was, at that time, the absolute ruler of France. A dark man; with a short black beard, keen eyes, and a look of self reliance and energy. A man who committed endless mistakes, but who was the life and soul of the French resistance. A man to whom--had he lived in olden times--the Romans would have erected a statue because, in her deepest misfortunes, he never despaired of the Republic. He looked keenly at the young men. \"Colonel Tempe tells me that you have rendered very great service, by going among the enemy in disguise; and that you are willing to make an attempt to carry dispatches into Paris.\" \"We are ready to try,\" Ralph said, respectfully; \"but after talking it over in every way, we can see but one disguise which would enable us to penetrate the enemy\u0027s lines, near enough to the ground between the two armies to render an attempt possible; and even that disguise will be useless, unless we can procure certain papers.\" \"What is your plan?\" Monsieur Gambetta asked. \"We intend to go as German Jews,\" Ralph said. \"The Prussians strip all the clocks, pictures, and furniture of any value from the villas they occupy, and send them back to Germany. There are a number of Jews who follow the army; and either buy these stolen goods from them, or undertake to convey them back to Germany at a certain price. Several of these Jews--with their wagons full of clocks, and other articles--have been captured by our franc tireurs or troops and, no doubt, papers of some kind have been found upon them. These papers would naturally be sent here. If we could be provided with them we could, I have little doubt, penetrate their lines.\" \"An excellent idea,\" the minister said. \"I have no doubt that we have such papers.\" And he struck a small hand bell on the table. An attendant entered. \"Tell Captain Verre I wish to speak to him.\" \"Captain Verre,\" he said, when that officer entered, \"there were some papers came last week, from General Faidherbe, relative to those wagons--laden with clocks, ladies\u0027 dresses, and so on--that were captured near Mezieres. Just look through them, and see if there were any German permits for the bearers to pass freely, for the purpose of trading. If so, let me have them at once.\" The officer at once left the room. \"Supposing--as I have no doubt--that we can give you the papers, what is your course?\" \"Speed is, naturally, an essential,\" Ralph said. \"We shall disguise ourselves at once and, upon receipt of the dispatches, start from here to Orleans by train; with two good horses--which can, of course, be furnished us. We shall ride through the forest of Orleans, and so to Montargis; cross the Loing there, and make straight for Melun--keeping always through by-lanes. As far as we know, there are no large bodies of the enemy along that line. \"When we get near the town, we shall leave our horses with some village Maire, or give them to a farmer, and walk into the place boldly. You will furnish us with a note to the Maire of Melun, as well as a circular to all French authorities, to give us any help; and we shall get him to assist us at once to buy a wagon, and two strong horses. With these we shall drive round, direct, to Versailles. Our pass will admit us into the town, without difficulty; and then we shall naturally be guided by circumstances. We must be furnished with a considerable sum of money, to make purchases of plunder.\" \"An admirable plan,\" said the minister, warmly, \"and one that deserves--even should it not obtain--success. \"I need not speak to you of reward because, as gentlemen, I know that you make the attempt from the love of honor Colonel Tempe has before spoken to me of you, and you were highly commended by General Cambriels. Your names will, therefore, be in the next Gazette for the cross of the legion of honor; and if you succeed, you will come back captains and commanders of the Legion. I may mention--although I know that it will not add to your motive to succeed--that you will be entitled to the reward, of fifty thousand francs, which has been offered to anyone who will carry in dispatches to Paris.\" At this moment the officer entered. \"Here are the papers the Jews with the captured wagons carried,\" he said. \"They are signed by the general at Frankfort, and countersigned by at least a dozen military authorities. There are three of them.\" The minister glanced at them. \"They will do well,\" he said. \"Will you be ready to start tomorrow morning?\" \"Quite ready,\" Ralph said. \"Very well. Then if you will be here at half-past five, the dispatches will be ready; written, of course, so as to fold up in the smallest possible compass. \"Captain Verre, will you see that two of the best horses in my stable are put into boxes, in the train that leaves at six tomorrow morning.\" The boys now rose to leave. \"Good morning,\" the minister said. \"All the letters of recommendation, the dispatches, and the money will be ready when you come, in the morning.\" The boys, on going out, held a long consultation over their disguises. Examining the papers, they found that one was for two persons of the same name--Isaac Kraph and Aaron Kraph--father and son; the father, as described in the pass, forty-five years old, the son eighteen. This pass they determined to use. The task of changing Percy into a Jew boy, of eighteen, was evidently an easy one. His clear complexion was the only difficulty, and this could be readily disguised. Ralph\u0027s disguise was a more difficult one; and there was a considerable debate as to whether he had better go as a red Jew, or a dark Jew. The latter was finally determined upon as, otherwise, the contrast between the supposed father and son would be too striking. They then went to their tailor, and found their uniforms ready. They at once put them on, as the peculiarity of the purchases they intended to make was so great that, had they been in their civilian dress, it was certain that they would have been regarded with suspicion; and would have, perhaps, had difficulty in obtaining what they wanted. Their first visit was to a hairdresser\u0027s shop. Rather to the astonishment of the proprietor, they told him that they wished to speak to him in a private room; and still more to his astonishment, when the door was closed, they told him that they wanted their hair dyed quite black. The hairdresser could hardly believe his ears. The boys had both brown, wavy hair--Percy\u0027s being the lightest--and that two young officers of the staff should, at such a time, desire to dye their hair struck the man almost dumb with astonishment. Ralph smiled. \"No wonder you are surprised, but we have an important mission to carry out, and it is essential that we should be completely disguised. We are going as spies into Von der Tann\u0027s camp. This, of course, is in the strictest confidence.\" The hairdresser was at once struck with the importance of the occasion. \"You want an instantaneous dye?\" he asked. \"Certainly,\" Ralph said, \"and one that will last, at any rate, for a week.\" There was no difficulty whatever in complying with the request and, in ten minutes, the boys\u0027 heads were raven in their blackness. \"Now,\" Ralph said, \"I want my brother\u0027s hair--which is fortunately very long--to be completely frizzled; and I want a pair of the tongs you do it with, so as to be able to do it for ourselves.\" This also was easy enough. \"Now,\" Ralph went on, \"for myself, I want my hair to be very long; to come down over my ears on to my collar, all the way round.\" \"But the only way to do that is to have a wig specially made for you.\" \"Not at all,\" Ralph said. \"I could not put on a wig, even if you had one just as I want it, ready. The parting always shows, if it is narrowly looked at. I want some long flat bands of hair, like those you use for chignons. It must be black, to match my hair as it is now; but put a few streaks of gray into it. I must have a band of this hair, long enough to go round the head, from just above one ear to just above the other. If you part my hair, just at the place where the band is to go; brush the hair up; put the band of artificial hair on, with shoemaker\u0027s wax, or something else to hold tight; then brush the hair back again over the band, it would be absolutely impossible to see it was not all natural. Then cut the long hair so as to lie on my coat collar, frizzle it and the natural hair, and I will defy the keenest-eyed Prussian to see anything wrong about it.\" As soon as the hairdresser understood exactly what Ralph wanted, he entered heartily into his plans; and several of the short flat bands of black hair, used for chignons, were sewn on to a band. This was fastened on to Ralph\u0027s head, in the way he had suggested; the long tresses were cut to the required length; the tongs were used on them, and on the natural hair; and plenty of oil put on and, in an hour, his headdress was perfect--an immense bush of frizzly hair. The cloth was taken from round his neck and, as he looked at himself in the glass, he joined heartily in Percy\u0027s shout of laughter. \"But, Ralph, how are you to go out in your uniform, and that head of hair?\" \"Dear me,\" Ralph said, \"I had quite forgotten that. Go to the tailor\u0027s, Percy, and tell them to send the suit I changed there in here, directly.\" Percy went off for the clothes, and Ralph then went on: \"Now I want a black or grayish beard, whiskers, and mustache.\" \"I have not got such a thing,\" the hairdresser said, \"but I know a man who keeps them. I will get it for you, in a quarter of an hour.\" In a few minutes Percy returned, with a boy with Ralph\u0027s clothes. In a short time they were ready to start. \"You do look a strange object, Ralph.\" \"Never mind, Percy, there are plenty of strange objects here. No one will notice me.\" Then saying that they would call in again in half an hour, for the beard, they went to a chemist\u0027s; from whom--after some talk--they obtained a mixture to give a slightly brown tinge to their faces. They now dived into the back streets of the town, found a second-hand clothes shop, and speedily got the articles they required. Ralph had a long greatcoat, with a fur collar; and a pair of high boots, coming up to his knees and to be worn over the trousers. A black fur cap completed his costume. Percy had a black cap, made of rough cloth, with a peak and with flaps to come down over the ears; an old greatcoat, with fur round the pockets and collar; a bright-colored handkerchief, to go two or three times round the neck; and high boots like those of Ralph. They then returned to the hairdresser, and Ralph insisted that the beard and mustache should be fastened on not only in the ordinary manner--with springs--but with cobbler\u0027s wax. \"My life,\" he said, \"might depend upon the things not slipping, at any moment.\" They now went home. The moment that they entered their rooms, Ralph exclaimed: \"Why, we have forgotten all about Tim!\" \"So we have,\" Percy said. \"He was to have met us in front of the railway station at nine o\u0027clock and, of course, he has no idea where to find us. I will go there. Very likely the poor fellow is waiting still.\" Percy hurried off; and found Tim, as he had expected, sitting upon the steps going up to the railway station. He jumped up, with a cry of joy, upon seeing Percy. \"The Vargin be praised, Mister Percy! I began to think that you must have been sent off somewhere, without time to warn me; and I couldn\u0027t, for the life of me, make out what to do.\" \"We have not gone, Tim,\" Percy said, not wishing to hurt the attached fellow\u0027s feelings, by telling him that he had been forgotten; \"but we are starting tomorrow. I will tell you all about it, when we get in. We have been to see Monsieur Gambetta, this morning and, do you know, we met Colonel Tempe last night, and are stopping in his rooms.\" So saying, he walked along at a quick pace towards their lodgings; Tim occasionally glancing a puzzled look at him. By the time they reached the room, Ralph had stained his face and hands, and was busy dressing in his disguise. His back was to the door, when they entered; but he had heard the Irishman\u0027s voice on the stair. \"Well, Tim, how are you?\" he said, turning round. \"Holy Vargin!\" ejaculated Tim, dropping into a chair, and crossing himself with great fervor \"Sure, I\u0027m bewitched. Here\u0027s an ould gentleman, wid a wonderful head of hair, has been staleing Mister Ralph\u0027s voice.\" The two boys went off in a shout of laughter at Tim\u0027s genuine terror. \"Sure, I\u0027m bewitched, entirely,\" he went on. \"He laughs for all the world like Mister Ralph. Did ye iver see the like? \"What is it all, Mister Percy dear?\" Percy had by this time taken off his cap; and Tim, as he looked him fairly in the face, gave another start. \"By the mother of Moses!\" he exclaimed, in terror, \"we\u0027re all bewitched. Mister Ralph\u0027s turned into an ould man, with a furze bush of hair; and Mister Percy\u0027s beautiful hair has all turned black, and shriveled itself up. Am I turning, myself, I wonder?\" and he looked into the glass, to see if any change had taken place in his own abundant crop of red hair. The boys were laughing so that they could not speak for some time, and Tim sat gazing at them in speechless bewilderment. At last Percy, by a great effort, recovered himself; and explained to him the whole circumstances of the case. The Irishman\u0027s astonishment ceased now, but his dismay was as great as ever. \"Then is it alone you\u0027re going?\" he said, at last. \"Are you going into danger again, without taking me with you? You\u0027d never do that, surely, Mister Ralph?\" \"I am very sorry, Tim, to be separated from you,\" Ralph said; \"but it is quite impossible for you to go with us. If you understood French and German as well as we do, the case would be different; but as it is, the thing is absolutely impossible. You know how great a trouble it was to disguise you, before; and it would treble our anxieties and difficulties. Not only that; but even if, in the face of every possible danger, we got you into Paris with us, there would be great difficulty in getting you out. Gambetta will give orders for us to be allowed to come out, in the first balloon; but it is by no means easy to get places in balloons, and it is unlikely in the extreme that we should be able to bring you out with us. So there you would be, shut up in Paris and separated from us, for months. \"No, no, Tim, the matter is altogether impossible. You stay quietly here and, in ten days or a fortnight--if all goes well--we shall be back again with you.\" \"And is it in a balloon you\u0027re thinking of coming out, Mister Ralph; flying like a bird through the air? Och, wirra, wirra! I\u0027ll never see yees again.\" \"Nonsense, Tim, there\u0027s no danger in a balloon. If getting in were no more dangerous than getting out, there would not be much peril in the matter.\" \"Ah, Mister Ralph dear, how can you be risking your life, and the life of your brother in that way? Shooting at a Prussian, or getting shot at, is all well enough; or going among them with your hair all puffed out, and your face painted brown, and the hair growing all over your face before its time, I say nothing against; but flying through the air, in a balloon, is just tempting the good Providence. I know what it will be. You\u0027ll be just touching against a cloud, and tumbling out, and breaking yourselves into smithereens; and nothing to take home to your dear father and mother, not to mention Miss Milly,\" and Tim fairly blubbered with grief, at the thought. The boys had great difficulty in pacifying the attached fellow; at last, with a face expressive of mournful resignation, he agreed to remain with Colonel Tempe until they returned; or until their prolonged absence rendered it likely that they would not return at all--Tim evidently making up his mind that the latter contingency would happen. In that case, as Tim--now his corps had ceased to exist--need no longer serve, he expressed his determination to return to Dijon; and to stay with Captain Barclay until the end of the war--as he should not, he said, have the heart to fight any more, when his masters were both killed. While the conversation had been going on, the boys had continued their toilettes. The preparation which they had obtained gave them an olive complexion; and their transformation was now so complete that the boys would have passed each other unknown, even had they looked steadily at each other. Ralph, especially, was utterly unlike himself. They now told Tim to go out and get his breakfast, and to return in two hours\u0027 time; and then started themselves, rounding their shoulders, and so narrowing their chests as much as possible. Ralph stopped at an optician\u0027s, bought a pair of slightly-colored spectacles, and put them on. It was now twelve o\u0027clock--the preparations having taken them three hours--and they went to the cafe where they were to meet Colonel Tempe, to breakfast. He was already there, and they walked up to the table where he was sitting. \"These seats are engaged,\" Colonel Tempe said, shortly. The Barclays sat down at the next table; and called, in a foreign accent, for two glasses of beer. Then they spoke together, for some little time, about a journey from Saint Malo which they had just made; and Ralph then turned to Colonel Tempe, still speaking French with a strong foreign accent. \"Pardon me, colonel,\" he said, \"we have just arrived from England. We have a very large quantity of army shoes, and I should feel under a great obligation if you could inform me who is the proper person to whom to apply.\" Colonel Tempe at once informed them, adding: \"If your shoes are good ones, and the price fair, and you can deliver them soon, you will not have to wait long; for they are greatly wanted.\" \"We have also some harness, for artillery horses,\" Ralph added. \"I do not know about that,\" the colonel said; \"but you will obtain all information from the officer I have mentioned.\" \"Thank you very much,\" Ralph said, and returned to his seat. Colonel Tempe looked at his watch, a little impatiently. Ralph, after a minute or two, again approached him. \"Don\u0027t you think we may as well have breakfast, colonel?\" he said, in his natural voice. The colonel looked at him, in speechless surprise. \"So the disguises are pretty good?\" Ralph said, smiling. \"Impossible!\" the colonel exclaimed. \"Do my eyes or my ears deceive me? Can it really be--?\" \"It\u0027s us, sure enough, colonel; and now, I suppose we may as well sit down.\" So saying, the boys took their seats at the table; but Colonel Tempe still looked from one to the other, in astonishment. \"Wonderful!\" he at last said, \"wonderful! Even now I know who it is, I do not see the faintest possible resemblance. \"Percy is, of course, less altered than you are, Ralph, because he is still young looking; but even now I should not recognize him. As for you, with that wonderful head of hair, and that beard, you look fifty; and as unlike yourself as possible. Upon my word, if it were anywhere else but here in Tours--where there are all sorts of oddities--I should be ashamed, as a colonel in the army, to sit down to table with you.\" \"You are a little ashamed, as it is,\" Ralph laughed. \"We had not intended to come out in our new character, so soon; but when my hair was once done, you see, it was impossible to go about in uniform.\" \"But what in the world have you done with your hair?\" the colonel said, examining him closely; for Ralph had taken off his fur cap and laid it beside him. \"You have not got a wig on; and yet, all that frizzly bunch cannot be your own.\" Ralph explained how it was managed, and added: \"And now, colonel, that you have recovered from your surprise, let us have breakfast.\" Breakfast was ordered, to which the boys did full justice; but Colonel Tempe was still getting on but slowly, for he could not take his eyes off Ralph\u0027s face. \"Will all that frizzle keep in?\" he asked, presently. \"Yes; the man said that the false hair--which is the greater portion of it--will keep as well for a week; and we have got a small curling iron, so we can beautify ourselves up when we like.\" \"Well, boys, I have no doubt, now, that you will be able to get as far as Versailles; as to getting through, that\u0027s another matter--but if anyone can, you will, I am convinced.\" \"I have not much doubt about it, colonel,\" Ralph said. \"I seem to see my way quite clearly into Paris. Much more clearly, indeed, than I do to getting out again.\" \"Oh, it does not matter about getting out again, boys. You can stop quietly in there, until the end of the siege.\" \"That is just what we don\u0027t want to do,\" Percy said. \"Would you kindly ask them to put into the dispatches a request that we may be sent out again, by the first balloon that comes? We have no fancy, either of us, for eating rats and cats; which I suppose is what it will come to, before it is over.\" \"I will see to it, boys,\" the colonel said, smiling; \"but really, I should advise your staying there. You have done all--and more than--your share of work.\" The boys shook their heads; and it was arranged that, if they got in, they should come out again in a balloon. The next morning, the boys were up at half-past four and, at half-past five, were at the Prefecture. Colonel Tempe sent in his name to the minister, and they were at once admitted. Gambetta was at his writing table. \"Good morning, Colonel Tempe,\" he said, cordially; and then added, in some surprise, \"who are these men you have with you, and where are your young Englishmen? I hope they will not be late.\" \"These are they,\" the colonel said, smiling. \"They are who?\" Gambetta said, puzzled. \"I do not understand you, colonel.\" \"These are the Lieutenants Barclay,\" Colonel Tempe said. The minister looked from the colonel to the two boys, and back again. \"Do you mean to say--?\" he began, incredulously. \"Yes, sir, it is us,\" Ralph said; \"and I do not think there is much fear of our being recognized.\" \"So little that I do not recognize you, now. \"There is no mistake, colonel?\" he said, gravely; \"no mystification? You give me your pledge, and assurance, that these are the officers who have volunteered for this duty? Remember, any mistake might be fatal.\" \"These are certainly the Barclays, sir. I give you my word.\" \"It is a marvelous disguise,\" Gambetta said, his doubts now laid at rest; \"and does them immense credit. \"There are the dispatches, gentlemen. They are done up in these two quills, and sealed. They are of the utmost importance; and must not, at any hazard, fall into the hands of the enemy. The dispatches are in duplicate so that, in case one only gets in, the purpose is served. \"This is a circular letter, to all maires and other French authorities, ordering them to give you every possible assistance. \"This is a special note, to the Maire of Melun. \"Here is a letter to General Aurelles, at Orleans. If he is not in when you arrive, the chief of his staff will do. He is ordered to send a staff officer with you, through the lines, as far as you require him. The horses are in the train. \"Now, goodbye. I wish you a very good future, for you are gallant young fellows.\" So saying, he shook them warmly by the hand; and they hurried off to the train. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3162/86790.html","bookId":872,"book":{"id":872,"title":"The Young Franc Tireurs","description":"简介： The usually quiet old town of Dijon was in a state of excitement.
