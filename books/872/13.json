{"id":10623,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 12: The Surprise.","content":"After the check in the Vosges, General Cambriels found it impossible to restore sufficient order, among the Mobiles, to enable him to show face again to the enemy. He was, besides, in want of many articles of urgent necessity. Half his force were shoeless; and the thin blouses which were--as has been said--all the covering that many of the Mobiles had, were ill calculated to resist the bitter cold which was already setting in. Ammunition, too, as well as food, was short. The general determined, therefore, upon falling back upon Besancon, and reorganizing his forces there. A wound in his head, too, which was insufficiently healed when he took the command, had now broken out again; and his surgeon ordered absolute repose, for a while. Upon the day of the fight, Ralph had ridden slowly to the rear, when he saw that the fight was going against the French. Hardened as he was by his work, and with an excellent constitution, his wound never for a moment assumed a troublesome aspect; but at the end of a week he was able--keeping it, of course, in a sling--to mount his horse, and report himself ready for duty. The headquarters were now at Besancon; and Ralph could, had he applied for it, have obtained leave to go to Dijon; but he had not done so, as he had been so lately at home, and he thought that the sight of his arm in a sling would be likely to make his mother more nervous, and anxious on their account, than before. The Germans were still at some distance from Besancon, being watched by Colonel Tempe and his franc tireurs, and by the irregular forces. A considerable army was now fast gathering at Besancon, and the regimental and superior staff officers were hard at work at the organization As aides-de-camp, the boys had little to do; and therefore requested leave, for two or three days, to go up to their old friends, the franc tireurs of Dijon. The general at once granted the required permission; adding, with a smile: \"Don\u0027t forget you are officers now, lads, and get into any hare-brained adventures, you know; and be sure you are back on Thursday, as I expect General Michel--my successor--to arrive on Friday; and I shall have to give you, as part of my belongings.\" \"We are sure to be back, general.\" And so they set off; taking, as usual, Tim Doyle with them, as orderly and servant. \"Faith, and I am glad enough to be out in the open again, Mister Ralph,\" Tim said, as they left Besancon behind. \"After living out in the woods, for six weeks; there does not seem room to breathe, in a crowded town.\" \"It\u0027s jolly to be out again, Tim; but I don\u0027t know that I mind a town again, for a few days.\" \"Ah, it\u0027s all very well for the likes of yees, Mister Ralph--with your officer\u0027s uniform, and your arm in a sling, and the girls all looking at you as a hero--but for me it\u0027s different, entirely. Out in the open I feel that--except when there\u0027s anything to do for your honors--I am my own master, and can plase myself. Here in the town I am a common hussar; and my arm is just weary with saluting to all the fellows, with a sword by their side, that I meet in the street. \"Then there\u0027s no chance of any fighting, as long as we\u0027re shut up in the walls of a town; and what\u0027s the use of being decked up in uniform, except to fight? Is there any chance of just the least scrimmage in the world, while we are back again with the boys?\" he asked, persuasively. The boys laughed. \"Not much, Tim; but we shall be pretty close to the enemy, and something may turn up, at any moment. But surely you\u0027ve had enough, in the last six weeks?\" \"Pretty well, Mister Percy--pretty well; but you see, the last affair didn\u0027t count.\" \"Oh, didn\u0027t it count!\" Ralph said, looking at his arm. \"I think it counted for two or three fights and, if you were not hit, I am sure you were fired at often enough to satisfy the most desperate lover of fighting, Tim.\" \"I was fired at often enough, I daresay, Mister Ralph; and I can\u0027t say that I liked it, entirely. It isn\u0027t so mighty pleasant--sitting like a stiff statue behind the general, with the shells falling about you like peas, and not allowed the divarshin of a single shot back, in return. \"\u0027Shoot away,\u0027 says I, \u0027as hard as you like; but let\u0027s shoot back, in return.\u0027\" The boys laughed, and the day passed pleasantly as they rode, and talked. The dusk had already fallen when they reached a party of franc tireurs. It was not their own corps, nor could the officer in command tell exactly where they could find them. \"We are scattered over a considerable extent of country,\" he said; \"and the colonel, alone, could tell you how we are all placed. I expect that he will be here, tonight; and your best plan will be to stay here, till he comes. We have not much to offer you, but such as it is, it is at your service.\" After a moment\u0027s consultation, the boys agreed to accept the offer; as they had palpably more chance of meeting Colonel Tempe, there, than in a journey through the woods, at night; and in another ten minutes their horses were tied to trees, and they were sitting by a blazing fire, with the officers of franc tireurs. The village consisted of only three or four houses and, as there were fifty men in the party upon which they had come, they bivouacked under the trees, hard by. \"How far off are the Germans?\" Ralph asked, when dinner was over; and they lay by the fire, smoking cigars. \"Ten miles or so,\" the officer answered, carelessly. \"No chance of their coming this way, I hope,\" Ralph laughed. \"We were very nearly caught near Saverne, once.\" \"So I heard,\" the officer said, \"but I am rather skeptical as to these night surprises. In nine cases out of ten--mind, I don\u0027t mean for a moment that it was so in your case--but in nine cases out of ten, these rumors of night attacks are all moonshine.\" \"Perhaps so,\" Ralph said, a little gravely--for he had already noticed that the discipline was very different, among these men, than that to which he had been accustomed among the franc tireurs of Dijon; \"perhaps so, but we can hardly be too careful. \"How do you all like Colonel Tempe?\" \"The colonel would be an excellent fellow, were he not our colonel,\" the officer laughed. \"He is a most unconscionable man. For ever marching, and drilling, and disciplining. If he had his way, he would make us like a regiment of line; as if there could be any good in carrying out all that sort of thing, with franc tireurs. He had about half of us together, for three or four days; and I give you my word it was as bad as slavery. Drill, drill, drill, from morning till night. I was heartily glad, I can tell you, when I got away with this detachment.\" Ralph saw that his new acquaintance was one of that innumerable class who conceived that drill and discipline were absurdities, and that it was only necessary for a Frenchman to shoulder a gun for him to be a soldier; so he easily avoided argument, by turning the subject. For a couple of hours they chatted; and then, as the fire was burning low, and the men had already laid down to sleep, Ralph suggested that they should do the same. \"I will walk round the sentries first, with you, if you like,\" he said. \"Sentries!\" the other said, with a laugh; \"there is my sentry,\" and he pointed to a man standing, ten paces off, leaning against a tree. \"The men have marched all day--they only came in an hour before you did--and I am not going to waste their strength by putting half of them out to watch the forest. \"No, no, I am no advocate for harassing my men.\" \"Good night, then,\" Ralph said, briefly, and he wrapped himself in his cloak, and lay down. \"We are not accustomed to this sort of thing, Percy,\" he whispered to his brother, in English, \"and I don\u0027t like it. No wonder our franc tireurs do so badly, if this is a sample of their discipline.\" \"I don\u0027t like it either, Ralph. The Prussians are advancing; and if that fellow last heard of them as ten miles off, they are as likely as not to be only two. I shan\u0027t be sorry when morning comes.\" \"Nor I either, Percy. However, here we are, and we have no authority over this fellow; so we must make the best of it, and hope that--for once--folly will not have its just reward.\" So saying, the boys remained silent for the night. But although silent, neither of them slept much--Ralph especially, whose arm was still very sore, and at times painful, hardly closed his eyes. He told himself it was absurd, but he could not help listening, with painful attention. Had the night been a quiet one, he need not have strained his ears; for as he knew, from the many hours he had passed at night upon guard, the hush is so intense--in these great forests--that one can hear the fall of a mountain stream, miles away; and the snapping of a twig, or almost the falling of a leaf, will catch the ear. The night, however, was windy; and the rustle of the pine forest would have deadened all sound, except anything sharp, and near. The sentry did not appear similarly impressed with the necessity for any extraordinary attention. He was principally occupied in struggling against cold, and drowsiness. He walked up and down, he stamped his foot, hummed snatches of songs, yawned with great vigor, and so managed to keep awake for two hours; when he roused the next for duty, and lay down with a grunt of relief. At last, after keeping awake for hours, Ralph dozed off. How long he slept, he knew not; but he was roused into full wakefulness by a touch on the shoulder, and by hearing Tim Doyle whisper: \"Hist, Mister Ralph, I\u0027ve my doubts that there is something wrong. I couldn\u0027t sleep, in this camp without watch or outposts; and for the last quarter of an hour, I fancy I\u0027ve been hearing noises. I don\u0027t know which way they are coming, but it seems to me they are all round us. I may be wrong, sir, but as sure as the piper--\" \"Hush, Tim!\" Ralph said to the Irishman, who had crawled noiselessly along, and had lain down by his side. \"Percy, are you awake?\" \"Yes, I woke at Tim\u0027s whisper. Listen.\" They did listen; and distinctly, above the sighing of the wind, they could hear a rustling, cracking noise. Day was just breaking, but the light was not sufficiently strong to show objects with any distinctness, among the trees. \"By Jove, we are surrounded!\" Percy said; and was just going to alarm the camp when the sentry, startled into wakefulness, challenged and fired. The franc tireurs woke, and leaped to their feet. Percy and Tim were about to do the same, when Ralph held them down. \"Lie still,\" he said, \"for your lives.\" His words were not out of his lips, when a tremendous volley rang out all round them; and half the franc tireurs fell. \"Now!\" Ralph said, leaping up, \"make a rush for a house. \"To the houses, all of you,\" he shouted, loudly. \"It is our only chance. We shall be shot down, here, like sheep.\" The officer of the franc tireurs had already atoned for his carelessness, by his life; and the men obeyed Ralph\u0027s call and, amidst a heavy fire, rushed across the fifty yards of open space to the houses. The door was burst in, with the rush. Ralph had not stopped at the first house but, followed by his brother and Tim Doyle, had run farther on; and entered the last house in the village. \"Why did you not go in with the others, Ralph? We have no chance of defending ourselves, here. We have only our revolvers.\" \"We have no chance of defending ourselves anywhere, Percy,\" Ralph said. \"There must be a couple of hundred of them, at least; and not above fifteen or twenty, at most, of the franc tireurs gained the houses. Resistance is utterly useless; and yet, had I been with those poor fellows, I could not have told them to surrender, when they would probably be shot, five minutes afterwards. We should be simply throwing away our lives, without doing the least good.\" There was a heavy firing now heard and, a moment after, half a dozen shots were fired through the window. Then there was a rush of soldiers towards the door, which Ralph had purposely left open. \"We surrender,\" Ralph shouted, in German, coming forward to meet them. \"We are French officers.\" \"Don\u0027t fire,\" a voice said, and then a young officer came forward. \"You are not franc tireurs?\" he asked, for the light was still insufficient to enable him to distinguish uniforms. \"We are officers of the army, upon General Cambriels\u0027 staff. This man is an orderly. \"Here are our swords. We surrender, as prisoners of war.\" The German officer bowed. \"Keep your swords, for the present, gentlemen. I am not in command.\" At this moment, another officer came up. \"Who have we here, Von Hersen? Why do you make prisoners?\" \"They are two staff officers, major.\" \"Hem,\" said the major, doubtfully. \"Well, if you are an officer,\" he continued, \"order your men to cease their resistance.\" The franc tireurs, most of whom had taken refuge in the same cottage, were still defending themselves desperately; and were keeping up a heavy fire, from the windows. \"I will order them to surrender, at once,\" Ralph said, quietly; \"if you give me your word that they shall be treated as prisoners of war.\" \"I will do nothing of the sort, sir,\" the German answered. \"Then I shall certainly not advise them to surrender,\" Ralph said, firmly. \"I have no authority, whatever, over them; but if I give advice, it would be that they should sell their lives as dearly as possible.\" The officer swore a deep German oath, and strode off. For five more minutes the fight continued round the cottage, many of the Germans falling; then a rush was made, there was a fierce contest inside the house--shouts, shrieks, cries for mercy--and then all was still. The young Barclays and Tim were now told to sit down near a tree, at a short distance off; with two sentries, with loaded rifles, standing over them. The German soldiers took from the houses what few articles they fancied, and then set fire to them; sitting down and eating their breakfast as the flames shot up. At a short distance from where the Barclays were sitting was a group of some eight or ten franc tireurs, and six or seven peasants, guarded by some soldiers. Near them the German major and two lieutenants were talking. One of the young men appeared to take little interest in the conversation; but the other was evidently urging some point, with great earnestness; and the major was equally plainly refusing his request, for he stamped his foot angrily, and shook his head. \"What a type that major is, of the brutal species of German,\" Ralph said. \"One used to meet them, sometimes. Their officers are either particularly nice fellows, mere machines, or great brutes; apparently we have a specimen of each of them, here.\" The officers passed near enough for the Barclays to catch what they were saying. The young lieutenant was very pale. \"For the last time, major, I implore you.\" \"For the last time, Lieutenant von Hersen,\" the major said, brutally, \"I order you to do your duty and, by Heavens, if you speak another word, I will put you in arrest!\" The young lieutenant turned silently away, called up twenty men, and ordered them to place the franc tireurs and the peasants against a wall. \"This is horrible, Ralph,\" Percy said. \"That scoundrel is going to shoot them, in cold blood.\" \"I protest against this execution,\" Ralph said, in a loud tone, advancing towards the major, \"as a cold-blooded murder, and a violation of all the rights of war.\" \"Hold your tongue, sir,\" the German major said, turning to him furiously, \"or, by Heavens, I will put you up there, too!\" \"You dare not,\" Ralph said, firmly. \"Outrage, as you do, every law of civilization and humanity; you dare not shoot an officer of the army, in cold blood.\" The major turned black with passion. \"By Heavens!\" he exclaimed. But the officer who had not--hitherto--interposed, threw himself before him. \"Pardon me, major,\" he said, respectfully, \"but the Frenchman is right. It would bring discredit upon the whole army to touch these prisoners of war. \"In the other matter, I have nothing to say. The order has been published that franc tireurs, and peasants sheltering them, shall be shot; and it is not for me to discuss orders, but to obey them--but this is a matter affecting all our honors.\" The major stood, for a moment, irresolute; but he knew well that the German military authorities would punish, probably with death, the atrocity which he meditated; and he said hoarsely, to some of the men near: \"Tie their arms behind their backs, and take them farther into the wood.\" Ralph, his brother, and Tim Doyle were hurried into the wood by their guards but--strict as is the discipline of the German army--they could see that they disapproved, in the highest degree, of the conduct of their commanding officer. They were still near enough to see what was passing in the village. Not a man of the franc tireurs begged his life, but stood upright against the wall. Two of the peasants imitated their example, as did a boy of not over thirteen years of age. Two other lads of the same age, and a peasant, fell on their knees and prayed piteously for life. The young officer turned round towards the major in one, now mute, appeal. It was in vain. \"Put your rifles within a foot of their heads,\" the lieutenant said. \"Fire!\" When the smoke cleared away, the soldiers were standing alone; and the peasants and franc tireurs lay, in a confused mass, on the ground. The lieutenant walked up to the major with a steady step, but with a face as pale as ashes. \"I have done my duty, Major Kolbach; your orders are obeyed.\" Then, without another word, he drew out his revolver, put it rapidly to his temple, and blew out his brains [an historical fact]. Brutal as Major Kolbach was, he started back in horror as the young lieutenant fell dead at his feet; while a cry of surprise and consternation broke from the men. The major did not say a word, but turned away and paced up and down, with disturbed steps; while the other lieutenant bent over the body of his comrade and, seeing that he was dead, in a hushed voice ordered the men who had run up to dig a grave, under the trees, and bring him there. When this was done he ordered the men to fall in--placing the Barclays, and Tim in their midst--and then went up to the major and saluted, saying coldly that the men were ready to march. The major nodded, signed to the orderly who was holding his horse to approach, vaulted into the saddle, and rode along the road back toward the main body of the army. The lieutenant gave the word, and the column marched off; leaving behind it the still smoking houses, and the still warm bodies of some sixty men. There was a general gloom over the faces of the men; and no one could suppose, from their air, that they were returning from a successful expedition, in which they had annihilated a body of enemy fifty strong, with the loss of only five or six of their own men. Discipline was, however, too strict for a word of blame, or even of comment to be spoken; and not a sound was heard but the heavy, measured tramp as the troops marched back through the forests. The major rode on, moodily, some forty or fifty yards ahead of the main body. They had not gone half a mile before there was a shot fired in the wood, close to the road. The major gave a start, and nearly fell from his horse; then recovered himself, and turned to ride back to the column, when there was another shot, and he fell off his horse, heavily, to the ground. The column had instinctively halted, and the lieutenant gave the word, \"Load.\" A shout of triumph was heard in the wood, \"Thirty-one!\" and then all was still. \"That\u0027s the old fellow who saved my life, ten days ago, Percy,\" Ralph said; \"and by Jove! much obliged to him as I was, then, I do think that I am more grateful now.\" Finding that the shots were not repeated, some twenty or thirty skirmishers were sent into the woods; but returned, in ten minutes, without finding any trace of the man who had shot the major. The lieutenant now took the command. There was a continuation of the halt, for ten minutes, while the major was hastily buried by the roadside; a rough cross being put up to mark the spot, and a deep cross cut made in the two nearest trees so that, even if the cross were overthrown, the place of the burial might be found afterwards, if necessary. Then the corps marched on again. The first use which the lieutenant made of his authority--even before giving directions for the burial--was to order the cords of the prisoners to be cut. Then the corps continued its march and, by the brightened faces of the men, it could be seen easily enough how unpopular their late commander had been; and that they cherished but slight animosity against the slayer. In a short time they struck up one of their marching songs and--prisoners as they were--the Barclays could not but admire the steady, martial bearing of the men, as they strode along, making the woods echo with the deep chorus. In three hours\u0027 march they reached the village which the troops had left, the evening before, to surprise the franc tireurs; having, as Ralph had learned from the lieutenant in command, received information from a spy of their arrival at the village, late at night; and having started at once, under his guidance. Here a considerable German force was assembled. The prisoners were not unkindly treated; but Tim Doyle was, of course, separated from them. Some astonishment was expressed at their youth; but it was assumed that they had been pupils at Saint Cyr or the Polytechnic, many of whom received commissions owing to the impossibility of finding officers for the immense new levies. Several of the officers came in to chat with them and, as these had been also engaged in the fights, ten days before, there were many questions to ask, upon either side. The boys learned that they would be sent on, next day; would be marched to Luneville, and sent thence by train. \"They are a fine set of fellows,\" Ralph said, when their last visitor had left them. \"Good officers, unquestionably; and when they are nice, capital fellows. I can\u0027t make out why they should be so brutal, as soldiers; for they are undoubtedly a kindly race.\" \"No doubt,\" Percy said, but he was thinking of other matters, and not paying much attention to his brother. \"Do you think we have any chance of making our escape, Ralph?\" \"Oh, we shall escape, fast enough,\" Ralph answered, confidently. \"With our knowledge of German, and looking so young, there can be no great difficulty about it, when we once get to the end of our journey; but it\u0027s no use our thinking about it, at present. We shall be a good deal too closely looked after. I only hope they will send us to Mayence, or Coblentz; and not to one of the fortresses at the other end of Germany. \"Mind, we must not give our parole.\" The next day, when they were summoned to start, they found that there were fifty or sixty other prisoners who had been brought in, from other directions. Some belonged to line regiments; but the greater portion, by far, were Mobiles who, in the retreat of General Cambriels, had been cut off or left behind and, after hiding in the woods for some days, were being gradually found and brought in. The Barclays were the only officers. They therefore took their places at the head of the prisoners; who formed, four deep--with an escort of Uhlans--and set off on their march. It was four days\u0027 march. The weather was cold and clear, and the Barclays were but little fatigued when they marched into Luneville. The greater part of the prisoners were, however, in a pitiable condition. Some were so footsore that they could hardly put one foot before the other. Others tottered with fatigue, and the men of the escort frequently used the flats of their swords, to compel them to keep together. As they marched through the streets of Luneville, the people in the streets uncovered; and the women waved their hands to them, and pressed forward and offered them fruit and bread, in spite of the orders of the escort. They were taken straight to the railway station, where they were put into a shed. Ralph and Percy had gained the goodwill of the sergeant in command of the escort, by the manner in which they had aided him by interpreting to the rest of the prisoners, and by doing their best to cheer them up, and take things smooth; and they now asked him to request the officer in command, at the railway station, to allow them to walk about until the train started, on parole. The request was--upon the favorable report of the sergeant--granted at once; and they were told that no train would go off until next morning, and that they might sleep in the town, if they chose. Thanking the officer for the permission, they went out of the station; when a tall, big-bearded German sergeant stopped before them. \"Donner wetter!\" he exclaimed, \"so here you are, again!\" The boys gave a little start; for they recognized, at once, the sergeant who had so closely questioned them in the cabaret, upon the night when they had carried off and hung the schoolmaster. Ralph saw, at once, the importance of conciliating the man; as a report from him of the circumstances might render their position a most unpleasant one and--even in the event of nothing worse coming of it--would almost ensure their captivity in some prison upon the farther side of Prussia, instead of at one of the frontier fortresses. \"Ah, sergeant, how are you?\" he said, gaily. \"It is our fate, you see, to be made prisoners. You were very nearly taking us, and now here we are.\" \"A nice trick you played me,\" the sergeant said, surlily, \"with your woodcutters, and your lame brother, and your sick sister, and your cask of beer. I got a nice reprimand over that affair.\" \"Come, sergeant,\" Ralph said, laughing, \"let bygones be bygones. All is fair in war, you know, and we did not touch a single hair of any of your men\u0027s heads. All we wanted was the schoolmaster. It would not do you any good to talk about it, now, and it might do us harm. It\u0027s quite bad enough for us, as it is.\" \"You\u0027re nice boys, you are,\" the sergeant said, with his face relaxing into a smile. \"To think of my being taken in, by two lads like you. Well, you did it well--monstrously well, I will say--for you never flinched an eyelash. \"So you are officers, after all. I never suspected anything about it, till three hours afterwards, when we went to relieve the sentry; and found him lying there, tied up like a bundle. We couldn\u0027t think, even then, what it meant, for you had made no attack; and it wasn\u0027t till morning that we found that the old schoolmaster had been fetched out of bed, and carried off on the heads of twenty men. \"Well, it was well done, and I bear you no malice.\" \"That\u0027s right, sergeant. Now come and have a jug of beer with us; you know, we had one with you, before. Don\u0027t you remember, we drank to the health of King William? If you like, you shall return the pledge, by drinking to Napoleon.\" The sergeant laughed. \"I\u0027ll do that,\" he said. \"You said, if you remember, when I proposed the king, that you did not wish to hear of his death; and I can say the same for your Napoleon. Especially,\" he added with a chuckle, \"as he\u0027s our prisoner.\" The boys went into a cabaret near, and drank a glass of beer with the sergeant; and then--saying \"Goodbye,\" very heartily--left him, and went into the town; well pleased to have got so well out of a scrape which might have been a very unpleasant one. They slept at a hotel, and were down at the station at the appointed time. It was a long journey--thirty-six hours--to Mayence. But the boys were too pleased--when they saw the line that the train was following--to have cared, had it been twice as far. The difficulties of escape from the western fortresses would have been immense; whereas, at Mayence, they were comparatively close to the frontier. At Mayence, too, the position of the prisoners was comfortable. They were allowed to live anywhere in the town, and to take their meals when they chose. They were obliged, twice a day, to answer at the muster roll; and were not, of course, allowed to go outside the fortifications. The one drawback, to the position of the French officers, was the utterly insufficient sum which the Prussian Government allowed them for board and lodging--only forty-five francs a month; that is to say, fifteen pence a day. It is needless to say that the officers who had nothing else to depend upon literally starved, upon this pittance; which was the more inexcusable that the French Government allowed more than twice this sum to the German officers who were taken prisoners. Upon this head, however, the boys had no discomfort. They had plenty of money in their pockets, for present uses; and they knew that they could obtain further supplies by writing home, via Switzerland. They were, therefore, unaffectedly glad when the train came to a stop at the station of Mayence, and the order was given for all to alight. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3162/86788.html","bookId":872,"book":{"id":872,"title":"The Young Franc Tireurs","description":"简介： The usually quiet old town of Dijon was in a state of excitement.
