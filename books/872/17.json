{"id":10627,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 16: A Desperate Attempt.","content":"\"So far, so good, Percy!\" Ralph said, when they heard the street door slam, as the orderly left. \"Hitherto we have had the most extraordinary good fortune and, as it\u0027s going to snow--for I felt a few flakes, as we came along--I look upon it as good as done.\" \"It will take away from us risk of being hit, but I don\u0027t see that it will make much difference in our risk of being drowned,\" Percy said. \"I own, Ralph, I am a great deal more afraid of that, than of the other.\" \"But it does, Percy. It makes all the difference in the world. We had agreed that we would put on life belts; but that we would blow the smallest quantity of air possible into them, so that they might give us some slight assistance, and yet not be too buoyant to prevent us from diving. Now we can blow them up with wind, so as to prevent the possibility of our being drowned. Once in the water, and we are safe from everything except a stray bullet. In a snowstorm, on such a dark night as this, they could not see our heads five yards off.\" \"But what is worse, Ralph, we shall not be able to see five yards, either; and should have no idea where we were swimming.\" \"I had not thought of that, Percy. Yes, that would be very serious,\" and Ralph thought, for some time. \"It seems a risk, this, Percy; but I can see no plan, except to draw their fire.\" \"How do you mean?\" Percy asked, puzzled. \"You see, Percy, our idea before was to get down to the shore, to put our dummy into the water, and to let it float down a hundred yards--the length of its string--and then to start ourselves, holding the other end of the string, in hopes that--if the sentries are really sharply on the lookout--they would see the dummy, instead of us, as it will be a much more conspicuous object; especially as we intended to do as much diving as we could, and our movements forward would jerk the dummy\u0027s string, and make him bob, like a man swimming. If they once caught sight of it, they would be too busy firing at it to look about for anyone else. \"Well now, I think that instead of giving up the dummy altogether--as we might have done, now that the snow has come on--we must let it float gently down, for seventy or eighty yards; and then throw a stone into the water by it, so as to draw the attention of the sentry. Or--if the sentries are pretty far apart--one of us might make a great splash in the water, when the dummy is floating; and then run back before the sentry gets up, and get into the water quietly, higher up. Their fire will act as a guide to us.\" \"We had better start soon, Ralph. It may take us an hour, or even two, to get down to the water; for we must go along like ghosts, so as not to alarm the sentries; and we shall have walls to get over, and all sorts of difficulties.\" \"All right, Percy. I do not see the use of waiting. We shall not get any warmer, by stopping here. It\u0027s like having a tooth out. One\u0027s got to do it, and the sooner it\u0027s done, the better. \"Now for our bundles.\" They went downstairs into a cellar--where the light could not be seen from outside--struck a light, and lit a candle. The first thing taken out of the bundle was the dummy--a net, rather larger than a man\u0027s head, tightly filled with corks; with a cord, a hundred yards in length, attached. Next were two complete suits, made of white calico; with caps, with long flaps of the same material. Next were two large rolls of India rubber webbing, about six inches wide, which they had brought from Tours with them. \"I can\u0027t think that that will be any good, Ralph.\" \"It will, indeed, Percy. The water will, of course, soak through; but what gets in will remain in, and the heat of the body will warm it, a good deal. I can assure you, it will be a great deal warmer than having the icy water flowing past you.\" Both boys now took off their coats and waistcoats, put on a warm flannel jersey over their flannel shirts, and then wound the bandages of India rubber round each other\u0027s bodies. They began under the arms; drawing the webbing tight, as they wound it round, so that its natural elasticity caused each turn to press tightly upon the turn above, which it overlapped. This bandage was continued down to the lower part of the body. Then they put on the life belts. Over them they put their suits of white calico, white shoes with India rubber soles, the white caps, and swimming gloves. They then put the \"dummy\" in a pillow case, which they had bought for it at Versailles. Before putting on their caps, they fastened the quills with the dispatches in their hair. In a belt, underneath their jackets, each carried a heavy revolver. \"This India rubber stuff regularly squeezes me, Ralph.\" \"All the better, Percy. You will feel the benefit of it, when you are in the water, believe me.\" The boys now knelt down together, and asked for protection through the peril which they were about to encounter. A few minutes later they rose, grasped each other\u0027s hand; and then--blowing out the light--groped their way upstairs, opened a window which led into the garden, and stepped out. The wind was blowing strongly. Snowflakes were being whisked hither and thither, like spray from a wave. Had it not been for the gleam from the snow-covered ground, it would have been impossible to see ten paces, here. As it was, it was intensely dark. \"It\u0027s lucky that it\u0027s downhill, Percy, or we should never find our way to the water\u0027s edge. If we keep descending, we must be there, at last.\" Before starting, the boys went a few paces from each other; and were pleased to find that their white costumes suited admirably as, between the driving snow and the white sheet upon the ground, they could not make each other out at more than eight or ten yards, even when they knew exactly where they stood. They now began to descend the hill, very carefully, step by step. The snow upon the ground made walking much more easy than it otherwise would have been. Their footsteps--muffled alike by the India-rubber soles, and the snow upon which they walked--were inaudible, even to themselves. They had several walls to climb, and the noiseless India-rubber soles were of good service, here. Several times they could hear the sentries, beating their feet upon the ground to warm them; but in no case were they near enough to see them. At last, after an hour and a half--spent in passing the three hundred yards which separated them from the river--they reached, in safety, the wall of the road which runs along by the river. Here the sentries were pacing along at distances of thirty or forty yards apart. The white houses, upon the opposite side of the road, could be faintly seen; and the boys moved along until opposite an opening between them, by which they could get through to the river. Looking over the wall, they could watch the sentries and--choosing their time when one had just passed, so that his back would be turned towards them--he no sooner disappeared in the darkness than they dropped noiselessly into the road, ran across the street, climbed a low railing, and stood in a garden which reached down to the river. They stood watching, for some time, to assure themselves that no sentry was placed in the garden; but at last they stole forwards and stood at the end of the garden, with the river at their feet. The snow--which was at their backs--was falling faster than ever. The river deepened rapidly from the wall; but the water was low enough for anyone to get along on the sloping side--faced with rough stone--between the foot of the wall and the water. The boys got over the wall, took the dummy from the bag and, holding one end of the cord, put it quietly into the water; and allowed it to float down, about sixty yards. \"Now, Percy,\" Ralph said, \"you get ready to slip into the water, as quietly as possible, the moment you hear a splash. I will leave this bag here, so as to know exactly where you have gone in and--as the rope is plenty long enough--you keep hold of it here, at sixty yards from the dummy; and I will fasten the slack end to the stone so that, when I go in, I have only to hold the rope in my hand, to be able to join you. I will take this heavy coping stone in my hand; will crawl along on this shelving bank, till I arrive at the dummy; and will then throw the stone in, and run back at full speed, and be in the water a few seconds after you are.\" \"All right, Ralph, I understand. Keep your pistol cocked in your hand, as you go.\" Ralph crept quietly along, under the wall, until he saw the dummy floating at the edge of the water, a few feet below him. He rose on his feet, to throw in the stone; when he heard a deep exclamation behind him and, looking round, he saw a dark figure within two feet of him. Another moment, and the sentry would have brought his rifle to his shoulder-- for he sprang back, giving a loud shout--but Ralph wheeled round instantaneously, threw up his revolver, and fired at the sentinel\u0027s body. He saw him fall; turned round, hurled the heavy stone with a loud splash into the water, and then--crawling low under the wall--ran at full speed back again. As he did so, two sentries in the garden over his head fired, in the direction of the splash in the water; and shouts were heard all along the bank. In another instant Ralph grasped the line, and slid down the snowy slopes into the water; entering so quietly that no sound, whatever, betrayed his entry. It was icy cold, and almost took away his breath. Twenty strokes, and he joined Percy. \"All right, old man, they can\u0027t see us now.\" \"You are not hit, are you, Ralph?\" Percy gasped. \"No, it was my revolver. I had to shoot a sentry, to save my life. It\u0027s lucky we have got these life belts on, for I am sure we should never get across.\" \"There! There!\" was shouted, in German. \"I see his head bobbing up and down,\" and eight or ten rifle shots were fired, from the garden where the sentry had fallen, in the direction of the dummy. The boys swam on desperately, then Ralph said: \"You can slip the string now, Percy. The dummy has done its work. It must be quite out of sight from the bank. \"Do not you feel the benefit of the India rubber?\" \"Yes,\" Percy said, \"I am warm enough, in the body; but my legs are in agony, from the cold. These gloves are helping us on, though, at a great rate.\" \"Well, there is one blessing,\" Ralph said, \"we can\u0027t miss the way, now.\" As he spoke, a heavy fire of musketry opened from the French, upon the other side. Alarmed at the sudden fire on the part of the Germans, they fired at the flashes of their guns and, fresh reinforcements coming up on either side, a heavy exchange of musketry shots took place across the river; partially over the boys\u0027 heads, but principally a hundred yards lower down the stream, in the direction where the dummy was seen by the Germans. The boys swam with long, steady, noiseless strokes. \"We must be halfway across,\" Ralph said. \"I am getting deadly cold, all over, Ralph. I can\u0027t sink, of course; but I shall freeze to death, before I reach the opposite bank.\" \"No, no, Percy,\" Ralph said, as cheerily as he could; though he felt, himself, that the intense cold was rapidly overcoming his strength. \"Keep up your heart. Strike as hard as you can. The more you exert yourself, the better.\" In another minute or two, Ralph found he was leaving Percy behind, and slackened his speed. \"Goodbye, Ralph. My legs are all cramped up, and my arms are numbed. I can\u0027t swim another stroke. It is all up with me,\" he said, faintly. \"God bless you. Don\u0027t stop with me; you can do no good, and your only chance is to go on.\" Ralph, however, put one hand upon Percy\u0027s life belt, and struck out for shore; but he felt that it was hopeless. Frightful pains were shooting through his limbs, and he breathed what he believed to be a last prayer; when a boom like thunder, a few yards off, galvanized him into life again--for he saw the gunboat, which they had seen in the morning, only a few yards distant. She had just fired a gun, loaded with grape, in the direction of the Germans who were firing. She was still at anchor, and the stream was drifting them down fast upon her. \"Help!\" Ralph shouted. \"Help! We are drowning, and have dispatches Throw a rope, quick!\" \"Where are you?\" answered a voice. \"Here, close to you, just abreast,\" Ralph shouted. In another instant a rope struck his face. He grasped it, twisted it tightly round Percy\u0027s body and his own, tied a rough knot with his last strength, and then lost consciousness. When he recovered his senses, his first sensation was that of intense pain--so intense that it extracted a groan from him. \"That\u0027s right, rub away; and pour some more brandy down his throat,\" a voice said. Then he became conscious that he was being rubbed with hot flannels. He opened his eyes, and saw a gleaming of moving machinery, and the red glare of furnaces. \"Where am I?\" he asked, at last. \"In the engine room of the gunboat Farcey,\" a voice said. \"I am suffering agony,\" Ralph murmured, between his teeth. \"I daresay,\" the officer who was standing by him answered. \"You were pretty near frozen to death. Luckily your life belts kept you from taking in any water, but it was a near squeak. Another three minutes in the water, and the doctor says it would have been all up with you.\" \"Where is my brother?\" Ralph asked suddenly; sitting up, with a full consciousness of all that had passed. \"He is coming round,\" the officer said. \"He was farther gone than you were; and his heart\u0027s action was altogether suspended, from the cold. His limbs are twitching now, and the doctor says he will do. \"You call him your brother, but I suppose you mean your son?\" \"Please lend me some clothes,\" Ralph said. \"I can stand, now.\" Some clothes had already been got in readiness, and warmed; and in a couple of minutes Ralph was kneeling by his brother\u0027s side. Percy was now coming to, and was suffering agonies similar to those which Ralph himself had experienced, from the recommencement of circulation in his limbs. He looked round, utterly bewildered; for he had become insensible before the Farcey\u0027s gun had given notice of her proximity. He smiled, however, when his eyes fell on Ralph\u0027s face. \"It is all right, Percy, thank God,\" Ralph said. \"We are on board the gunboat Farcey and, in ten minutes, we shall be landed in the heart of Paris.\" In another five minutes, Percy was sufficiently recovered to begin to dress. The commander of the Farcey now turned to Ralph. \"Your son has had a very narrow shave of it, sir.\" \"Son!\" Ralph said, \"He is my brother.\" The officer looked surprised. \"How old do you take me to be?\" Ralph asked. \"Forty-five or fifty,\" the officer said. \"I shall not be seventeen for some months,\" Ralph answered. The officer looked at him with an air of intense astonishment, and there was a burst of laughter from the men standing round. The commandant frowned angrily at them. \"Quite so, my dear sir,\" he said, soothingly. \"I was only joking with you. It is evident that you are not yet seventeen.\" \"You think I have lost my senses, with the shock,\" Ralph said, smiling. \"I can assure you that that is my age. My beard and whiskers are so firmly fixed on, with cobbler\u0027s wax, that I shall have an awful trouble to get them off; and my hair the same. If you feel along here, from one ear to the other, you will feel a ridge. That is the cobbler\u0027s wax, that sticks all this mass of frizzled hair on. \"Did you not notice that both my brother\u0027s and my face and hands were much darker than the rest of our skin?\" \"Yes, the doctor did notice that,\" the captain said--now beginning to think that Ralph was not insane, after all. Passing his finger where Ralph directed him, he felt the ridge of the false hair. \"Who are you then, may I ask?\" he said. \"My brother and myself are named Barclay,\" Ralph said. \"We are lieutenants in the army, and are both decorated for service in the field. We left Tours four days ago, and are bearers of dispatches from Gambetta to General Trochu.\" A cheer broke from all who were standing within hearing; and the boys\u0027 hands--for Percy came up at the moment--were warmly shaken by the officers of the boat, one after another. Congratulations of all sorts were heaped upon them, and those around were unable to make enough of them. \"No pigeon has come in, for ten days,\" the commander said. \"You will indeed be welcome.\" At this moment, a sailor came down to say that they were passing the Louvre and, in another two minutes, the gunboat lay alongside the wharf. \"You do not know, I suppose, where Trochu is to be found?\" the commander of the Farcey asked. \"No, indeed,\" Ralph said. \"I will go with you, myself,\" the officer said. \"If the general has gone to bed, we must knock him up. He won\u0027t mind, when he hears the reason.\" It was but a short distance to walk, but the boys had great difficulty in getting there; for their limbs were stiff and aching, and they felt a burning sensation all over them, as if they had been dipped in boiling water. General Trochu had not yet gone to bed and--upon the message being delivered by the orderly, \"The commander of the Farcey, with officers bearing dispatches, from Tours,\"--he ordered them to be instantly admitted. \"These are the Lieutenants Barclay, general,\" the commander of the Farcey said. \"A heavy firing broke out, suddenly, from the water side at Lower Meudon. It was answered from our side and--thinking that it might be someone trying to swim across--I fired a round of grape into the Germans, and ordered a sharp lookout to be kept. I had scarcely spoken the words before we were hailed for a rope; and in another minute these officers--both insensible from cold--were pulled on board. Thinking they might have dispatches, I at once started up the river; and when they were brought round, by the surgeon, they stated that they were the Lieutenants Barclay, bearers of dispatches from Tours.\" \"Gallantly done, gentlemen! Bravely done!\" the general said warmly, shaking both boys by the hand. The burning heat of Percy\u0027s hand struck him, at once. \"Where are your dispatches, gentlemen? You have preserved them, I hope?\" Ralph produced the two quills. \"They are duplicate, general,\" he said. \"We each carried one, in case any accident might befall one of us.\" \"Thank you,\" the general said. \"I need now detain you no longer. I have work here for all night, and you had better go instantly to bed. Your brother is in a high state of fever.\" He touched a bell, and an officer in waiting came in. \"Captain Bar, will you kindly take these gentlemen to a hotel, at once. The horses are, as usual, in the carriage I suppose; and,\"--he dropped his voice--\"send a message from me to request Doctor Marcey to see them, at once. The younger one is in a state of high fever.\" In another quarter of an hour the boys were in comfortable beds, in rooms adjoining each other. Ralph--who was heavy and stupid, with the effects of the cold--was asleep almost the instant his head touched the pillow. He was roused a short time afterwards by being shaken and, opening his eyes, he saw someone leaning over him. \"Drink this,\" the gentleman said, holding a glass to his lips. Ralph mechanically did as he was told; and fell off again into a heavy sleep, from which he did not awake until late the next afternoon. His first impulse was to look at his watch. It had stopped at eleven o\u0027clock, the night before--the hour at which he had entered the Seine. Then he rang the bell. \"What o\u0027clock is it?\" he asked, when the servant entered. \"Just struck five, sir.\" \"What, five in the afternoon?\" Ralph exclaimed. \"Yes, sir.\" \"I have slept,\" Ralph said, with a laugh. \"However, I feel all right again, now. \"Is my brother up?\" \"No, sir,\" the man said. \"Percy!\" Ralph shouted, \"It is five o\u0027clock in the afternoon. Get up.\" \"The other gentleman is not in the next room, sir,\" the servant said. \"Is he not?\" Ralph said, puzzled. \"I was desperately sleepy last night, certainly; but not too sleepy, I should have thought, to have made a mistake about that. I feel sure he was in the next room.\" \"He was, sir,\" the servant said, \"but Doctor Marcey, when he came to see you--just after you got into bed--ordered him to be carried at once into another room, in order that he might not disturb you. He said it was essential that you should have your sleep out, undisturbed.\" \"But why should my brother disturb me?\" Ralph asked, anxiously. \"Is he not well?\" \"No, sir, he has got fever. He has been calling out, a great deal. He has got two sisters with him, and the doctor has been every hour.\" By this time Ralph was out of bed. \"Here are some clothes, sir,\" the man said, handing them to him. \"The landlord thought you would want some at once, when you woke; and ordered three or four suits for you to try.\" Ralph seized the first that came to hand, and threw them on. \"All Paris was talking about your getting through the enemy, last night, sir. There have been hundreds of people here to call.\" Ralph did not even hear what was said. \"Now,\" he said, \"take me to him, at once.\" The servant led Ralph along a passage and stopped at a door, at which he knocked. A Sister of Mercy opened the door. \"This is the other gentleman.\" The sister opened the door for Ralph to enter. \"He is quiet now,\" she said, in a soft, compassionate tone. Ralph went into the room. Percy lay in the bed, with his head surrounded with ice. His face was flushed, and his eyes wild. He was moving uneasily about, talking to himself. \"It is that schoolmaster who is at the bottom of it,\" he muttered. \"He was a traitor, and I thought we hung him, but I suppose we didn\u0027t. Perhaps he got down, after we had gone off. If not, how could he have betrayed us again? \"I have heard of liquid fire, but that was liquid ice. It got into my veins, somehow, instead of blood. I tell you, Ralph, it\u0027s no good. I can\u0027t stand it any longer; but I will pay off that schoolmaster, first. Let me get at him,\" and he made an effort to rise. The sister tried to restrain him, but so violent were his efforts to rise that Ralph--who was looking on, with tears streaming down his cheeks--was obliged to assist to hold him down. When he became quiet, the sister forced some medicine between his lips--Ralph holding up his head. \"Shall I speak to him?\" Ralph asked. \"He may know my voice.\" \"Better not, sir,\" the nurse said, \"it would probably only set him off again.\" \"What does the doctor say about him?\" Ralph asked. \"He says it is brain fever,\" the nurse said. \"He only said it might be some days, before the crisis came; and that he could not give any decided opinion, at present. But he seemed to have hope.\" \"Thank God, at least, for that!\" Ralph said, earnestly. Percy, turning his head round again, caught sight of Ralph. \"Ah, there is that schoolmaster again! If no one else will hang him, I will do it, myself. Let me get at him!\" And he again made desperate efforts to get out of bed. \"You had better go, sir,\" one of the sisters said, urgently. \"The sight of you makes him worse, and you can do him no good.\" Seeing that it was so, Ralph reluctantly left the room; his only comfort being that Percy was as carefully tended, and looked after, as it was possible for him to be. He had scarcely returned to his room, when an officer was shown in. \"I daresay you hardly remember me,\" he said. \"I came here with you, last night.\" \"I am very glad to see you again, and to thank you for the trouble you took,\" Ralph said. \"I was too sleepy to do so, last night.\" \"Not at all,\" the officer answered. \"However, I am here with a message from the general, now. He would have asked you to dine with him but, hearing of the state of your brother, he could not ask you to leave him for so long a time; but he would be glad if you would come to see him, for an hour, this evening. He wishes to know how you managed to pass through the German lines; and he also desires to be informed, as far as you can give such information, of the number and position of the enemy. \"What surprises us all, more than anything, is that the dispatches are dated the morning of the thirteenth instant; and you were picked up, by the Farcey, upon the evening of the sixteenth. It seems incredible that you should have done the distance, and managed to get through the German lines, in the time. Only one other messenger has got through; and his dispatches were more than ten days old, when they reached us, and had been forestalled by some pigeons. Your news is six days later than any we have received.\" \"We slept, on the night of the thirteenth, at Montargis,\" Ralph said; \"on the fourteenth at Melun, on the fifteenth at Versailles; and last night--as you know--here.\" \"I must not get the information before the general,\" the officer said, with a laugh. \"It is half-past six, now. The general dines at seven. At what time will you be with him? Shall we say nine?\" \"I will be there at nine,\" Ralph said, \"but the general will, I hope, excuse my coming either in uniform, or full dress of any kind. I have, of course, nothing with me.\" \"General Trochu will of course understand that,\" the officer said. \"Goodbye.\" Ralph now went back to Percy\u0027s room. The doctor had just come. He was accompanied by another medical man. Ralph stood by, in silent attention, while the doctor felt Percy\u0027s pulse, and asked a few questions of the nurse. They then gave some orders, and said that fresh medicine should be sent in, in a quarter of an hour; and that they would come in again, at ten o\u0027clock, to see how he was going on. \"What do you think of him, sir?\" Ralph asked, as the doctor came out. \"He has a sharp attack of brain fever,\" the doctor said, \"but he is young, with an excellent constitution. I trust we shall pull him through. I cannot say anything for certain, at present--till the fever takes a turn, one way or the other--but I have strong hopes.\" Ralph ordered some dinner to be sent up to his room, for he began to be keenly awake to the fact that he had eaten nothing, for more than twenty-four hours. After he had taken the meal, he sat in Percy\u0027s room, until it was time to go to General Trochu\u0027s; keeping himself, however, in a position so as to be hidden by the curtain--for the sight of him evidently excited the patient. Percy was, as far as his brother could see, in just the same state as before: sometimes talking to himself, in disconnected sentences; sometimes raving wildly, and imagining himself repeating the scenes through which he had passed, since he left home. At nine o\u0027clock, exactly, Ralph sent in his name to the governor; and was at once shown in. The general had already left the table, and was smoking in a small study. With him were Generals Ducrot and Vinoy. General Trochu rose, and shook him cordially by the hand; presented him to the other generals, and asked him to take a cigar, and sit down. \"Generals Ducrot and Vinoy are surprised, I see, at your appearance, Captain Barclay,\" General Trochu began. \"By the way,\" he interrupted himself, \"you are in the Gazette, this morning, as captain.\" Ralph bowed, and expressed his thanks. \"No thanks are due at all, Captain Barclay,\" the old veteran said. \"You have well earned your promotion; and Gambetta--who speaks of you, I may say, in the highest terms--tells me that he promised you the step, if you got in. I need not say that, whether he had done so or not, I should have given it to you. \"But I was saying, I see Generals Vinoy and Ducrot are surprised--as I am, myself--at your appearance. Gambetta, in his letter, twice uses the expression young officers. Once he said, \u0027these young officers have greatly distinguished themselves, and have gained the cross of the legion of honor;\u0027 and again he says, \u0027these young officers have volunteered to carry dispatches.\u0027 \"Naturally, my friends were looking for a younger man; and having only seen you for an instant last night, and not having observed your features, specially, I confess that I was expecting a younger man. \"You see,\" he said, with a smile, \"we can quite understand Gambetta\u0027s calling your brother a young officer, for he is a mere lad; but one would hardly have applied the same term to yourself.\" Ralph had flushed crimson, at the commencement of this speech. \"I must apologize very greatly, general,\" he said, when the Governor of Paris stopped; \"for the mistake is certainly due to my own forgetfulness.\" His hearers looked surprised. \"I slept until five o\u0027clock this afternoon,\" Ralph continued; \"owing, I believe, to a powerful opiate that the doctor you kindly sent us gave me. Since I woke, my thoughts have been entirely given to my brother; and the thought of my singular appearance never entered my mind. I have become so accustomed--in the few days since I left Tours--to this beard, mustache, and hair, that I never thought of them, for a moment. Had I thought of it, I could not have presented myself before you, this evening; for I should not have presumed to do so, in my present state; and it will take me some hours of hard work, and not a little pain, before I get rid of them--for they are fastened on with shoemaker\u0027s wax and, I fear, will not come off, without taking a considerable portion of skin with them.\" The three generals laughed heartily at Ralph\u0027s apology, and their own mistake; and General Trochu then asked him to give them a full account of what had happened to him, what he had seen, and what information he had gained since he left Tours. Ralph told the story unaffectedly, from beginning to end, and received warm commendation from his listeners. \"Your story began at Tours,\" General Trochu said; \"where had you last been, before that?\" \"We had only arrived, ten days before, from a German prison,\" Ralph answered. The generals all laughed. \"You are adventurous fellows, you and your brother,\" General Vinoy said. \"How did you get taken, and how did you get out?\" Ralph again told his story. \"You are cool hands, you Barclays,\" General Ducrot said. \"How did you get commissions first? Were you at the Polytechnic, or Saint Cyr?\" \"No, general,\" Ralph said, modestly, \"we had no such advantages. We won our commissions--and the cross of the Legion--in the Vosges, as franc tireurs.\" \"In which corps?\" General Trochu asked, a little sharply. \"They have not done any very great things, the franc tireurs.\" \"We were in the franc tireurs of Dijon,\" Ralph said, a little proudly. \"We several times beat superior forces. We blew up the bridge of the Vesouze; and should have blown up the tunnel of Saverne, had it not been for treachery.\" \"Yes, yes,\" General Trochu said; \"I remember Gambetta has once or twice mentioned your corps, especially. You see, we don\u0027t hear much from outside. \"Let us hear of the affairs you have mentioned. Your account will give us a better idea of the state of things, in the Vosges, than fifty dispatches would do.\" Thus asked, Ralph gave an account of the doings of the corps; from the day they arrived in the Vosges, to the day he had left them--reduced to a fourth of their original strength. The three generals sat and smoked their cigars while he spoke, asking questions occasionally. \"Very good,\" General Trochu said, when he finished; and the other generals cordially assented. \"But how come you to speak German so well?\" General Trochu asked; \"and how was it you understood the English in which the officer spoke, at Saverne?\" \"We are English,\" Ralph said; and his hearers gave a simultaneous start of surprise. \"That is to say, our nationality is English, though we are half French. Our father--an officer in the English army--was wounded, left the service, married a French lady, and settled in France for a time. We have been educated partly in England, Germany, and France; so that we speak the three languages nearly equally well.\" \"Well, Captain Barclay,\" General Trochu said, \"I am almost sorry that you are not French; for you would be a credit to any country. \"And now, I think it is time to be going to bed,\" and he drew out his watch. \"Bless me, it is one o\u0027clock! I had no idea it was so late. Good night. \"I will not ask you to call again, for a day or two; as your brother will naturally occupy your attention, and care. I trust that I shall soon hear good news of him.\" \"Good night, Captain Barclay,\" the other generals said, cordially, each giving him their hands; and Ralph made his way across the dark streets--for there was no gas--back to his hotel. He went at once up to Percy\u0027s room; and found that, if not decidedly better, he was at least no worse; and the Sisters of Charity, who were nursing him, said that the doctors had spoken hopefully at their last visit. Ralph had intended to sit up all night, but the nurses assured him that he could be of no use, whatever; and indeed, that he would be worse than useless, as his presence excited Percy. They themselves were keeping watch, by turns. Accordingly Ralph--who still felt the effects of the cold immersion--went off to bed and--in spite of the late hour at which he had risen--was in a few minutes sound asleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3162/86792.html","bookId":872,"book":{"id":872,"title":"The Young Franc Tireurs","description":"简介： The usually quiet old town of Dijon was in a state of excitement.
