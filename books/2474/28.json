Dunstan paged carefully through it, taking his own sweet time, and then he motioned Rix inside without a word.\n Dunstan put the casebook on a table and began filling his corncob pipe with tobacco. \"I had a call from Mr. Bodane this mornin\u0027,\" he finally .said. \"He verified what Raven told me about you, that you\u0027re a published writer. Called the library yesterday to see if they had any of Jonathan Strange\u0027s books over there. They didn\u0027t. So I sent one of the fellas from the Democrat over to the bookstore at Crockett Mall.\" His wheelchair whirred across the room to a bookshelf, and he showed Rix the paperback copies of Congregation and Fire Fingers. \"Read a little bit out of each of them last night. They ain\u0027t too bad - but they ain\u0027t too good, either.\"\n \"Thank you,\" Rix said dryly.\n \"So.\" Dunstan turned the wheelchair around and regarded him thoughtfully through a haze of pipe smoke. \"You want to help us with the book, and you figure I\u0027ll go for the idea since you\u0027re a published writer.\"\n \"Something like that.\"\n \"This is a project I\u0027ve been workin\u0027 on for a long time. I suppose you could say\" - his mouth curved to one side - \"that it\u0027s a labor of love. Raven and I are a good team. I\u0027m not so sure we need another member.\"\n \"Maybe you don\u0027t,\" Rix agreed, \"but I\u0027ve shown you how serious I am about this. I\u0027m taking a hell of a risk by coming here. I had to sneak out after lunch like a thief. I can get you whatever you need from the Gatehouse library. I can help you with the writing. And most important, an Usher name on the cover will give it credibility. Have you thought about that?\"\n Dunstan didn\u0027t reply, but Rix saw his eyes narrow almost imperceptibly. He had scored a point, Rix thought. \"I brought you the casebook. And I\u0027ve told you what you wanted to know, haven\u0027t I?\"\n The other man grunted. \"I\u0027ve known about the Baird Retreat for months. I digested that material and returned the book to Mr. Bodane. Sorry, I\u0027m still not sold. I can\u0027t figure out exactly why you want to help so badly.\" His teeth were clamped around the pipe\u0027s stem like a bulldog\u0027s. \"If you think you\u0027re gonna waltz in here and get your hands on the manuscript - maybe screw it up, for all I know - you\u0027re wrong, my friend.\"\n This was like trying to find a chink in a granite wall. \"Edwin trusts me,\" Rix said, nettled. \"Why won\u0027t you?\"\n \"Because I\u0027m not the trustin\u0027 type.\"\n \"Okay, fine. Then what can I do to make you trust me?\"\n Dunstan pondered the question. He rolled the chair over to the bay window and watched gray-bellied clouds scudding across the sky, then looked at Rix. \"Mr. Bodane entered this deal with the stipulation that he supply documents only - no verbal information.\n In his own way, I guess he\u0027s still bein\u0027 loyal to Walen. I admire that. He wouldn\u0027t tell me what Walen\u0027s condition was, and that\u0027s why I had to find out from you. I\u0027ve got some questions that need answers: things that connect events of Usher history. And only an Usher can give me the answers.\"\n \"Try me.\"\n Dunstan motioned toward a chair, and Rix sat down. \"Okay. I want to know about the cane. The black cane with the silver lion\u0027s-head. Why\u0027s it so important to your family? Where\u0027d it come from, and why does every patriarch carry it like some kind of royal scepter?\"\n \"As far as I know, Hudson Usher brought it with him from Wales. Old Malcolm probably carried it, too. I think whoever possesses it is recognized by the family as the head of the estate and the business. There\u0027s no secret about that.\"\n \"Maybe not,\" Dunstan said, \"but maybe it\u0027s more than that, too.\" He let smoke leak from the corner of his mouth. \"The cane wasn\u0027t always in your family. It was stolen once, from Aram Usher - your great-great-grandfather - and was lost for almost twenty years. In those twenty years, your family had more than its share of bad luck: Aram was killed in a duel, his son Ludlow was almost killed several times, Ludlow\u0027s half-sister, Shann, had a career tragedy, Usherland was overrun by Union troops, and your family\u0027s steamboat, railroad, and textile businesses went bust.\"\n This rash of information was startling to Rix. \"Are you suggesting there\u0027s a connection between all that and the cane?\"\n \"Nope. Just speculatin\u0027. That was probably the most disastrous period of Usher history. The only thing that didn\u0027t suffer too much was the armaments business. That rolled in a fortune during the Civil War - especially since Usher Armaments sold rifles, bullets, and artillery pieces to both sides. Old Aram was smart. His heart might\u0027ve belonged to the South, but he knew the North was gonna clean house.\"\n \"Who stole the cane?\" Rix asked, intrigued by these new facts of Usher history. \"A servant?\"\n \"No. An octoroon gambler from New Orleans named Randolph Tigre. Or at least that was one of his names. I say \u0027stole\u0027 only figuratively. Aram\u0027s second wife, Cynthia Cordweiler Usher, gave it to him.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"He was blackmailin\u0027 her. She was the widow of Alexander Hamilton Cordweiler, who owned steamboat lines, a network of railroads, and a big chunk of the Chicago stockyards. Cordweiler was sixty-four when he married her; she was eighteen.\"\n \"Blackmailing her? What for?\"\n Dunstan\u0027s pipe had gone out, and he took a few seconds to relight it. \"Because,\" he said, \"Cynthia Cordweiler Usher - your great-great-grandmother - was a murderess.\" He smiled faintly at Rix\u0027s grim expression. \"I can tell you the story, if you want to hear it. I\u0027ve put together bits and pieces from various sources, and I\u0027ve had to guess at some of it - from what happened later.\" He raised his bushy eyebrows. \"Well? Got the nerve to hear it, or not?\"\n \"Go ahead,\" Rix replied.\n \"Good. It starts in the summer of 1858. Ludlow was about four weeks old. Aram was in Washington on business. If he\u0027d been home, things might\u0027ve taken a different turn. Anyway, a gentleman caller came to the Lodge. He waited downstairs while a servant took his calling card up to Cynthia\u0027s bedroom . . .\"\n The smoke swirled around Wheeler Dunstan\u0027s head as he spoke. Rix listened intently, and imagined that in the blue whorls of smoke were faces - the ghosts of the past, gathering around them in the room. The smoke formed pictures; the Lodge on a sunny summer\u0027s day, light streaming through the windows and across the hardwood floors. A lovely, strong-featured woman in bed, with an infant suckling at her breast. And a card in her trembling hand that gave the name of Randolph Tigre.\n \"Send him away,\" Cynthia Usher told her maid, a strapping young black woman named Righteous Jordan. \"I\u0027m occupied with my son.\"\n \"I told him you wasn\u0027t gonna see him, ma\u0027am,\" she said; Righteous stood almost six feet tall and had a stomach as wide as a barrel. \"Told him right to his face, but he say it don\u0027t matter, that I was to give you his card.\"\n \"You have. Now go back downstairs and tell him to - \"\n \"Good morning, Mrs. Usher.\" It was a soft, silken voice that raised goosebumps on Cynthia\u0027s arms. Righteous whirled around indignantly. Randolph Tigre, wearing a natty tan suit and carrying a thin riding crop, was leaning casually in the doorway. His teeth gleamed in his handsome, coffee-and-cream-colored face.\n \"Lord God!\" Righteous tried to block the man\u0027s view. \"Don\u0027t you have no decency?\"\n \"I don\u0027t like waiting, so I followed you up here. Mrs. Usher and I are old . . . acquaintances. You can leave us now.\"\n Righteous\u0027s cheeks swelled at such impertinence. It was bad enough that this man had talked his way through the front gate - but for him to be standing there while Mrs. Usher was feeding her little baby was downright scandalous. He was smiling like a cat, and Righteous\u0027s first impulse was to pick him up and heave him down the stairs. What stopped her from doing so was the fact that he was the most handsome man she\u0027d ever seen; the large topaz stickpin in the center of his black cravat was the exact color of his keen, deepset eyes, and he had a neatly trimmed mustache and beard. The creamy hue of his flesh made Righteous appear, by contrast, to have recently bathed in India ink. He wore tan calfskin gloves, and English riding boots polished to a high, warm luster. To be a free man of color was one thing, Righteous thought, but for him to flaunt himself openly in these troubled times was begging for a beating. \"Get yourself out of here while Mrs. Usher arranges herself!\" Righteous snapped protectively.\n Cynthia had laid the infant down on a silk-brocaded pillow, and now she calmly buttoned her gown to the throat.\n \"I\u0027m not the coalstove stoker, Missy,\" Tigre said. His eyes had flashed like warning beacons, and there was a shade of menace in his voice. \"Don\u0027t use that tone with me. Tell her, Mrs. Usher. We\u0027re old friends, aren\u0027t we?\"\n \"It\u0027s all right,\" Cynthia said. Righteous looked at her incredulously. \"Mr. Tigre and I . . . know each other. You can leave us alone now.\"\n \"Ma\u0027am? Leave you alone up here? In your bedchamber?\"\n \"Yes. But I want you to return in a quarter of an hour . . . to escort Mr. Tigre out of the Lodge. Run on, now.\"\n The black woman snorted and stormed out. Randolph Tigre stepped aside as she passed, and gave a hint of a bow. Then he closed the door and turned toward Cynthia Usher with a cool, insolent smile. \"Hello, Cindy,\" he said softly. \"You look breathtaking.\"\n \"What the hell are you doing here? Are you insane?\"\n \"Now, now, that\u0027s not proper language for a lady of leisure, is it?\" He strolled around the sumptuous bedroom, his hands exploring the textures of blue velvet, carved mahogany, and Belgian lace. He lifted a jade vase from her dressing table and examined the intricate workmanship. \"Exquisite,\" he murmured. \"You\u0027re a woman of your word, Cindy. You always vowed you\u0027d own exquisite things someday - and now look at you, mistress of Usherland.\"\n \"My husband will be returning shortly. I advise you to - \"\n Tigre laughed quietly. \"No, Cindy. Mr. Aram Usher left for Washington by train yesterday morning. I followed his coach to the station. He\u0027s a nice-looking man. But then . . . your head was always turned by a wide pair of shoulders and a tight pair of trousers, wasn\u0027t it?\" He plucked a hand-painted Japanese fan from its ceramic stand and stretched it open, admiring the colors. \"You\u0027ve struck it rich again, haven\u0027t you? First Alexander Cordweiler - and now Aram Usher.\" Tigre nodded toward the gurgling infant. \"His, I assume?\"\n \"You must be out of your mind to set foot on this estate!\"\n \"In fact, I\u0027ve never been more sane. Don\u0027t I look fine?\" He showed her his matching topaz cufflinks, and produced a gold pocket watch studded with diamonds. \"I was always lucky at cards. The gaming boats that run from New Orleans to St. Louis are packed with sheep who bleat to be sheared. I\u0027m happy to oblige them. Of course . . . sometimes my luck needs a helping hand.\" He opened his waistcoat and patted the small pistol he carried in a leather holster. \"Your husband produces fine guns.\"\n \"Either state your business, or get out of my house.\" Her voice shook and she was speared with shame.\n Tigre walked over to the far side of the room, peering out the windows upon the lake. \"I have a present for you,\" he said. He turned and flipped something - a silver coin, sparkling in the sunlight that spilled through the window - onto the bed. It landed at her side. Cynthia reached for it - but her hand froze in midair. Her fingers slowly curled into a fist.\n \"It\u0027s a reminder of the good old days, Cindy. I thought seeing it would please you.\"\n She had recognized the object. How he\u0027d gotten one of them, she didn\u0027t know, but her business-honed mind rapidly grasped the situation: the little silver coin could destroy her life.\n Tigre came to the foot of the bed. She caught the odors of his pungent cologne and minty brilliantine - old, familiar aromas that, to her horror, made her heart beat faster. She pulled her knees protectively to her chest under the sheet.\n \"You\u0027ve missed me, haven\u0027t you?\" he asked. \"Yes. I can tell. I could always read your eyes. That\u0027s why we were such a good team. You would entertain the customers with your stories and laughter - and then the judgment of God would fall on their heads. I never missed once with that hammer, did I? But they died happy, Cindy; you needn\u0027t fear the fires of hell.\"\n The baby began crying. Cynthia held Ludlow close. \"That was a long time ago. I\u0027m not the same woman.\"\n \"Of course not. How many millions did you inherit from Cordweiler? Ten? Twenty? Your riverboats are comfortable, I\u0027ll say that. I play my best games of poker on the Bayou Moon.\" Slowly his smile began to fade. A thin sneer replaced it, and Tigre played his fingers over the leather riding crop. \"You never answered my letters. I began to have the feeling you didn\u0027t want to see me again. After all, I introduced you to Cordweiler . . . or have you forgotten? Tell me something - how did you do it? Rat poison in his cake? Arsenic in his coffee?\"\n She stared icily at him. Ludlow strained at her bosom.\n \"No matter,\" he said, with a curt wave of his hand. \"However it was done, you covered your tracks well. Which brings me to another question: When are you going to murder Aram Usher?\"\n \"Get out,\" she whispered. \"Get out of here before I call for the police!\"\n \"Will you? I don\u0027t think so. We\u0027re the same, deep inside. But hammers aren\u0027t your style - yours is the slick word and the wet kiss. I\u0027m tired of waiting for my just due, Cindy.\" He nodded impatiently toward the infant. \"He\u0027s hungry. Why don\u0027t you take out your tit and feed him?\"\n She didn\u0027t respond. Tigre leaned against the bed\u0027s scrolled walnut cornerpost. \"I\u0027ve come to be fed, too. At the first of every month, you\u0027re to deliver ten thousand dollars in an envelope to the Andrew Jackson Suite of the Crockett Hotel in Asheville.\"\n \"You\u0027re insane! I don\u0027t have that kind of cash!\"\n \"No?\" Tigre reached into his pocket. With a flip of his hand he filled the air with shining silver coins. Cynthia flinched as they fell around her, striking her on the face, hitting the bed and the infant\u0027s crib, clattering on the floor. \"I have a boxful of those. Ten thousand dollars, every month. I\u0027ll even show you how reasonable I can be; this month I\u0027ll only expect five thousand dollars. And that handsome cane your husband carries with him.\"\n \"That\u0027s an heirloom! He even sleeps with it! It would be impossible to - \"\n \"Hush,\" Tigre; said gently. \"I want that cane. I admired it yesterday at the train station. Get it away from him, I don\u0027t care how. Fuck him senseless - you were always adept at that.\" He glared at the crying infant. \"Can\u0027t you shut him up?\"\n \"I won\u0027t be blackmailed,\" Cynthia vowed defiantly. \"You don\u0027t know who you\u0027re talking to: I\u0027m Cynthia Cordweiler Usher! My husband loves me, and I love him. He won\u0027t listen to your filth!\"\n Tigre leaned forward, his golden eyes bestial with barely controlled rage. \"You forget - I know where the bodies are buried. The Chicago police might like to learn who and what you really are. Aram Usher\u0027s a smart man; he\u0027ll dump you in the gutter if he even thinks . . . Damn it to hell!\" He suddenly darted around the crib and snatched the crying child from Cynthia\u0027s arms. She grasped for the baby, but Tigre laughed and quickly stepped backward. He slid his hand around Ludlow\u0027s neck.\n \"Little tit-sucking bastard,\" he breathed, his eyes wild with fury. Cynthia had seen him like this before, and she didn\u0027t dare make a sound. \"If you were mine, I\u0027d wring your neck and throw you out that damned window! Go on, scream for your mother! Scream!\"\n \"Give him to me.\" She was desperately trying to remain calm. Her voice cracked, and her arms trembled as she reached for her child.\n Tigre thrust his grinning face toward the infant\u0027s. \"You\u0027ll remember me long after I\u0027m gone, won\u0027t you? That\u0027s good. I like to leave my mark.\" He held the child over Cynthia\u0027s arms and dropped him like a sack of laundry. As she caught him, Tigre reached forward and ripped her gown open. Buttons flew.\n Both of Cynthia\u0027s breasts were exposed. She clutched the child to her, and he began to suckle.\n \"Mrs. Usher?\" Righteous called from beyond the door. \"You all right, ma\u0027am?\"\n Tigre laid his riding crop against her cheek.\n \"Yes,\" she said in a whisper. Then, louder \"Yes! I\u0027m . . . I\u0027m fine. Mr. Tigre is just leaving.\"\n \"You remember what I said. Five thousand dollars and the cane. From then on, ten thousand a month.\" He traced her cheekbone with the crop. \"You have a lovely complexion, Cindy. You always were a beauty. Perhaps you\u0027ll visit me at the Crockett Hotel yourself?\"\n \"Get out!\" she hissed.\n \"I\u0027ll be waiting for your first payment,\" he told her, withdrawing toward the door. He stopped to smile and bow gracefully, and then he left the room.\n Quickly, Cynthia set Ludlow aside and began to gather up the coins. She stuffed them hastily into the pillowcase to dispose of later.\n A week afterward, Aram\u0027s cane disappeared from the parlor. Servants scurried through the Lodge in search of it. Cynthia surmised that one of the servants had stolen and sold it. Aram spent long hours locked in his room, disconsolate, after firing half of the staff. Cynthia stayed to herself, spending most of her time with the infant, who slept in the fur-trimmed crib beside her bed.\n Less than three months later, a shriek from Cynthia in the middle of the night brought Aram running from his chamber down the corridor. He burst in to find her strangling his son; Ludlow\u0027s face was blue in the lamplight, and his small body writhed as he fought for breath. He tore her away from him, but she screamed, \"He\u0027s choking!\" and Aram realized something was caught in the baby\u0027s throat.\n He wrenched Ludlow\u0027s mouth open and dug in with his fingers. \"Help him!\" Cynthia begged frantically. Aram picked the child up and held him by the heels, trying to shake the object loose. Ludlow\u0027s throat was still blocked. Cynthia grasped the bellcord and began tugging at it, summoning servants from a lower floor. The bells of alarm echoed through the halls, an eerie chorus of disaster.\n Keil Bodane, old Whitt\u0027s son, reached the room first. He rushed toward Aram, took the infant in his arms, turned him upside down, and whacked him hard on the back. Whacked him again. And a third time.\n A gurgling cough burst from the baby\u0027s throat. Something clinked on the floor and rolled away. Then Ludlow howled as if trying to wake the dead. Sobbing, Cynthia took him and rocked him in her arms.\n \"What\u0027s this?\" Aram bent to the floor, picked up something, and held it to the light. Cynthia saw the glint of silver - and the breath halted in her own lungs. \" \u0027The Willows,\u0027 \" he read from the coin. \" \u0027Room Number Four. Cindy.\u0027 \" When he looked up at her, his face was already freezing into the hard mask that he would wear for the rest of his life. \"Explain to me,\" he whispered, \"how a whorehouse token almost strangled my son to death.\"\n Wheeler Dunstan watched Rix carefully. \"Cynthia must have missed one of the tokens when she was gathering them up. The thing had lodged somewhere in the baby\u0027s crib. Ludlow swallowed it. And so her secret was out. When she was sixteen years old, she was a working prostitute at a whorehouse in New Orleans.\"\n \"What happened? Did Aram divorce her?\"\n \"Nope. I think he really loved her, very much. He\u0027d been married once before, to a Chinese girl in San Francisco, and he had a daughter by her: Shann, who in 1858 was twelve years old and studying music in Paris. But. he admired Cynthia\u0027s business ability and of course he adored Ludlow. A divorce would\u0027ve ruined Cynthia socially, and probably financially, too.\"\n \"What about Tigre? If he had such a hold on her, he wouldn\u0027t give up so easily, would he?\"\n \"Aram found him at the Crockett Hotel - it stood where the Crockett Mall is now - and publicly challenged him to a duel. Of course, dueling was against the law, but Aram Usher had connections in high places. Cynthia begged him not to fight, because Randolph Tigre was an expert shot, but he wouldn\u0027t listen. They met in a field not too far from here. Tigre even brought the cane. They were to fight with gold-plated Usher pistols.\" Dunstan smoked for a moment in silence. \"It was no contest. Tigre shot him between the eyes, and Aram Usher fell dead on the spot.\"\n \"And then Tigre went after Cynthia again?\"\n \"No,\" Dunstan replied. \"Aram loved her; he wanted to protect both her and the boy. When Keil Bodane checked Aram\u0027s pistol, he found it was unloaded. It had never been loaded. In essence, Aram had committed suicide - and Randolph Tigre, a black man with a gambler\u0027s reputation, had committed murder. Tigre was forced to flee the state. In death, Aram had won. His will provided that Cynthia take over the armaments business and the estate, but it would all go to Ludlow on his eighteenth birthday.\"\n \"What about the cane?\" Rix asked. \"How did it get back into the family?\"\n \"That\u0027s another question I can\u0027t answer. Ludlow retrieved it - but how, I don\u0027t know.\" He took the pipe from his mouth and held it between his palms. \"There are a lot of questions that need answers. Sometimes I think I\u0027ll never find them. This book is important to me - damned important.\" Dunstan clenched his hands together, knots of muscle standing up in his forearms. \"Maybe I\u0027ve spent six years workin\u0027 on it, but it\u0027s been in my mind for a long time.\"\n \"Ever since the accident?\" Rix ventured. \"Edwin told me about it. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"Fine,\" Dunstan said bitterly. \"You\u0027re sorry about it, my wife is dead, my daughter has deep emotional and physical scars, I\u0027m crippled - and Walen Usher sat behind a wall of lawyers who said I was drunk when we crashed. He went home to his Lodge, and I had to fight with every ounce of strength in my body just to keep my newspaper. I saw how the Usher mind worked - take what you please, when you please, and the consequences be damned. From that point on, I wanted to find out everything I could about you Ushers. I\u0027m going to finish this book, no matter what your family throws at me - and then, by God, people will know the truth: that you Ushers have the moral sense of maggots and no conscience at all, and you\u0027ll sell your souls for the almighty dollar.\"\n Rix started to protest, then reconsidered. His presence here, he realized, was proof of what the man had said; morally, he was betraying his family in pursuit of the money and recognition this book might bring him. Still, what choice did he have? If he wanted control of this project, he first had to control Dunstan\u0027s trust. \"How can I help you?\" he asked calmly.\n The other man stared at him in silence, trying to make up his mind. \"Okay,\" he said finally. \"If you really want to help, I\u0027ll give you the chance. As I said, I need some questions answered: How did Ludlow get the cane back? How did Cynthia Usher die, and when? What happened to Shann?\" His eyes were icy with determination. \"Ludlow was a young genius with a photographic memory. I\u0027ve read that he built a workshop somewhere in the Lodge\u0027s basement for his inventions. What were they? Then there\u0027s another question - a larger one, and probably the most important of all.\"\n \"What?\"\n Dunstan smiled slightly, with a trace of arrogance. \"You find me the other answers first. Then we\u0027ll talk again.\"\n \"And you\u0027ll show me the manuscript?\"\n \"Maybe,\" Dunstan said.\n Rix nodded, and rose to leave. For now, he\u0027d have to play this game Dunstan\u0027s way. \"I\u0027ll be back,\" he promised, and went to the door.\n \"Rix?\" Dunstan called after him. Rix paused. \"You be careful,\"\n Dunstan told him. \"You don\u0027t know Walen the way I do.\"\n Rix left the house and went to his car under a sky dappled with gathering clouds. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/usher-s-passing/page-28.html","bookId":2474,"book":{"id":2474,"title":"Usher\u0027s Passing","description":"Storyline: \n In this most gothic of Robert McCammon\u0027s novels, setting is key: the continuing saga of the Usher family (descended from the brother of Roderick and Madeline of Edgar Poe\u0027s \"Fall of the House of Usher\") takes place in the weird and picturesque heart of the North Carolina mountains.
