{"id":82944,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"THE PUMPKIN MAN WAS IN THE WOODS. He wore a funeral suit of black velvet and a black top hat. His face was as yellow as spoiled milk. He carried a scythe that glowed electric blue in the moonlight, and with a wave of one skeletal hand he parted the underbrush before him. Those who had seen him and lived to tell the tale said his eyes shone like green lamps; his face was split by a cunning grin, his teeth sharpened to tiny points. The Pumpkin Man was used to waiting. He had all the time in the world. Sooner or later a child would wander from a familiar path, or chase a rabbit into a place where shadows slanted like tombstones. Then there would be no more going home, ever again. He carried his weapon in an easy grip, and sniffed the night wind for the human scent. A small animal tore away through the weeds. The Pumpkin Man stood like a statue, his only movement the slow sweep of his gelid gaze through the darkness. He looked toward the Gatehouse, where the Usher boy was sleeping. The Usher boy had come home again. If the Usher boy didn\u0027t come out to play tomorrow evening - then there would always be the next. Or the next. He stood beneath the Usher boy\u0027s window, staring upward. Come out, come out and play, he whispered in a voice like the wind through dead trees. You\u0027re the one I want, little Usher boy - When Rix forced himself awake, his nerves were jangling like fire alarms. He sat up in bed. The walls of his room were crisscrossed with shadows - tree branches, outlined by moonlight. He\u0027d never had such a vivid nightmare about the Pumpkin Man before. The thing had looked like a picture he\u0027d seen of Lon Chaney in London After Midnight, all hypnotic eyes and vampire teeth. Got to cut down on those damned late-night \"Creature Features,\" he told himself. They\u0027re not too good for the old beauty sleep, are - A floorboard creaked. There was a shape standing over his bed. Watching him. Before Rix could react - he was about to cry out like a child - a smoky feminine voice that dripped with honey whispered, \"Shhhhh! It\u0027s me, sugah!\" He found the switch to the bedside lamp after much fumbling, and turned it on. Squinting in the light, he looked up at Puddin\u0027 Usher, his brother\u0027s wife. She wore a diaphanous pink gown that clung to her body as if she\u0027d been poured into it. Showing through the filmy material were the dark circles of her nipples and the darker vee between her thighs. She was about as naked as a woman could be without taking off her clothes. Her heavy blond mane cascaded around her bared shoulders. Puddin\u0027 wore full makeup, including bright red lipstick and champagne eyeshadow. Her eyes were dark brown, as unfathomable as Usherland\u0027s peaty lakes. She\u0027d put on perhaps ten pounds since Rix last saw her, but she was still beautiful in a wild, coarse way. Her figure, stuffed into a red swimsuit a size too small, had won her the title of Miss North Carolina several years ago. In Atlantic City, she had twirled flaming batons in the talent competition, and she hadn\u0027t even made the finals. Her full-lipped, sexy mouth always made her look as if she was begging to be kissed - the harder, the better. But now her mouth had a bitter twist to it. Her face was taking on a hardness. Her eyes were vacant, disturbed. Rix smelled a wave of perfume - Chanel No. 5? - coming off her, but underneath that fragrance was a complex aroma of bourbon and body odor. In fact, Puddin\u0027 smelled as if she hadn\u0027t taken a bath in a week or more. \"What are you doing in here? Where\u0027s Boone?\" \"Gone bye-bye,\" she said, and her mouth twisted again as she smiled. \"Gone to that club of his to play poker till all fuckin\u0027 hours.\" Rix looked at his wristwatch on the bedside table. A quarter of three. He rubbed his eyes. \"What happened? You two have a fight?\" She shrugged. \"Me and Boone have fights sometimes.\" She spoke with a thick backhills whang. \"He left around midnight. They let him sleep at that club after he\u0027s lost his money and he\u0027s too drunk to drive home.\" \"Do you make a habit of sneaking into people\u0027s rooms? You scared the hell out of me.\" \"I didn\u0027t sneak. Sneakin\u0027 is when a door\u0027s locked.\" There were no locks on the doors to Rix\u0027s, Boone\u0027s, or Katt\u0027s bedrooms. Puddin\u0027 frowned at him. \"You\u0027re lookin\u0027 kinda puny. You been sick or somethin\u0027?\" \"Or something. Why don\u0027t you pour yourself into your room and go to sleep?\" \"I want to talk. Please. I\u0027ve got to talk to somebody, or I\u0027ll go right fuckin\u0027 out of my bird!\" Same old Puddin\u0027, Rix thought. When she was drunk, she could swear a truck driver\u0027s face blue. \"What about?\" he asked, against his better judgment. \"If you was a gentleman, you\u0027d ask me to sit down.\" He motioned reluctantly toward a chair. Puddin\u0027 chose to sit on the edge of the bed. Her gown hiked up over her thighs. There was a heart-shaped birthmark on her left knee. Damn, Rix thought; his body was responding, and he raised his knees under the sheet to make a tent. Puddin\u0027 picked at a long, copper-painted fingernail for a moment. \"I cain\u0027t talk to nobody \u0027round here,\" she whined. \"They don\u0027t like me.\" \"I thought you and Katt were friends.\" \"Katt\u0027s too busy for friends. Either she\u0027s out ridin\u0027 on the estate, or she\u0027s on that telephone. One time she talked to a guy in Venice for two whole fuckin\u0027 hours! Now who in hell can talk on a phone that long?\" \"Do you also listen in on people\u0027s phone conversations?\" She tossed her head impudently. \"I get bored. There ain\u0027t a whole hell of a lot to do, y\u0027 understand? Boone pays more attention to those goddamned horses than he does to me.\" She giggled. \"Maybe if I put a saddle on my back, he\u0027d get a hard-on, right?\" \"Puddin\u0027,\" Rix said wearily, \"what\u0027s this all about?\" \"You\u0027ve . . . always kinda liked me, ain\u0027t you?\" \"We hardly know each other.\" \"But what you know, you like. Don\u0027t you?\" She touched his hand. \"I guess so.\" Though he knew he should, he didn\u0027t move his hand. His groin stirred. Puddin\u0027 smiled. \"I thought so. A woman can tell. You know, the gleam in a man\u0027s eye and all. You should\u0027ve seen those men judges in Atlantic City sit tall when I come out on stage. You could almost hear their cocks thump against the bottom of that desk. Old stuck-up bitches was the ones voted against me.\" \"I think you\u0027d better go back to your room.\" He wrinkled his nose. \"When was the last time you had a bath?\" \"Soap causes cancer,\" she replied. \"I heard it on the news. There\u0027s something in soap that gives you cancer. Know what\u0027s best for your skin? Gelatin. Know what that is? It\u0027s Jell-O, I put Jell-O in the bathtub and let it sit until it gets real firm. Then I get in and wiggle around. Orange is best, \u0027cause it\u0027s got vitamin C in it too.\" He wanted to ask her if she was losing her mind, but didn\u0027t. Maybe she was losing her mind. Living in this house would certainly do it. \"I know you like me,\" Puddin\u0027 said. \"I like you, too. Really. I always thought you were cute and smart and all. You\u0027re not like Boone. You\u0027re . . . well, a gentleman.\" She leaned closer to him, the valley between her breasts opening. Bourbon fumes rolled into his face. She whispered, \"Take me with you when you leave here. Okay?\" When Rix paused, taken off guard, Puddin\u0027 plowed on: \"Everybody hates me \u0027round here! Especially the dragon lady! That mother of yours has got eyes in the back of her head! She just looooves to tell lies about me! Katt\u0027s all hung up on bein\u0027 a model and a celebrity and all. Edwin and Cass watch me all the time. I cain\u0027t even drive alone to Asheville to go shoppin\u0027!\" \"I don\u0027t believe that.\" \"It\u0027s true, damn it! They won\u0027t let me out the front gate! See, I tried to run off in August. Had a gutful of this fuckin\u0027 place, and took off in the Maserati. They sent the cops after me, Rix! State trooper pulled me over right outside Asheville, hauled me to the jailhouse on a charge of car theft! Had to sit there all night till Boone came for me!\" She scowled bitterly.\"He lied to me to get me to marry him. Said he was a world traveler, and a billionaire to boot. I didn\u0027t know I\u0027d be a prisoner here, and that he didn\u0027t have one cent of his own to spend!\" \"Boone\u0027s got his talent agency.\" \"Yeah. That.\" Puddin\u0027 laughed sharply. \"It was paid for with old Walen\u0027s money. Boone\u0027s still payin\u0027 him back, with interest. Boone ain\u0027t got a pot to pee in!\" \"He will be rich,\" Rix said. \"After our father dies\" - the realization sank in as he said it - \"the family business will belong to Boone.\" \"Oh no. You\u0027re wrong. Boone wants it, but so does Katt. And Boone\u0027s scared shitless the old man\u0027s gonna hand everything over to her, lock, stock, and fuckin\u0027 barrel!\" Rix pondered that for a moment. All the Usher children had attended the Harvard School of Business, with a stipulation that they return to Usherland every weekend. Boone had flunked out after a year, Rix had quit to study English Lit at the University of North Carolina, but Kattrina had graduated with honors. She\u0027d always been interested in fashion and modeling, and had opened her own agency in New York when she was twenty-two. After a couple of years, she\u0027d sold the agency for a profit of almost three million dollars; then she\u0027d decided to free-lance for herself, at the rate of two thousand dollars an hour. Her golden, healthy look was enormously popular in Europe, where her face sold everything from fur coats to Ferraris. \"Katt\u0027s happy,\" Rix said. \"She\u0027s not interested in the business.\" \"Boone knows she wants it. He says your daddy\u0027s been talkin\u0027 to her in secret. That\u0027s why old Walen\u0027s never let Boone handle any of the decisions.\" \"That doesn\u0027t mean anything. He\u0027s never let any of us handle decisions.\" He smiled. \"So Boone\u0027s champing at the bit, is he?\" \"Sure. Just like you are.\" \"Sorry. I don\u0027t want a damned thing to do with it.\" \"That ain\u0027t what Boone says. He says you\u0027re pretendin\u0027 not to be interested. He says you\u0027re waitin\u0027 for the old man to die, just like everybody else. Know what Boone told me when we got married?\" She blinked her heavy lids. \"He said the business was worth about ten billion dollars, and that every time somebody even thinks there\u0027s gonna be a war, the millions come rollin\u0027 into those factories by the truckload. He says that\u0027s because nobody in the world, not even the Germans, makes weapons better than the Ushers. Now you look me straight in the eye and say you don\u0027t want a piece!\" \"I don\u0027t,\" he said firmly, \"want a piece.\" \"Bullshit.\" Her breasts were about to spill from her gown, the nipples peeking over like brown, crosseyed eyeballs. \"Only a goddamn idjit wouldn\u0027t want a cut of ten billion bucks! That\u0027s all the money in the world! Look, I know you protested V\u0027etnam when you was in college, but you ain\u0027t a hippie no more. You\u0027re a grown man.\" Her voice trailed off, and for a moment she appeared to be about to keel over. Then she clutched his arm. \"I cain\u0027t stand this place no more, Rix. It\u0027s creepy around here, \u0027specially at night. The wind blows so hard when it gets dark. Boone goes off and leaves me alone. Now, with the old man in that room right over my head . . . I cain\u0027t stand the smell of him, Rix! I want to be with people who like me!\" \"Have you tried talking to Boone about - \" \"Yes, I\u0027ve tried,\" Puddin\u0027 snapped, her face reddening. \"He don\u0027t listen! He just laughs! Boone . . . don\u0027t want to be around me no more.\" Tears came to her eyes, but Rix couldn\u0027t tell whether she was forcing them or not. \"He says he . . . cain\u0027t go to bed with me. Me! Head majorette at Daniel Webster High School! A beauty contest winner! Hell, I used to have football players wantin\u0027 to just sniff my panties! Boone\u0027s got a cock like a wet noodle!\" It took a moment for that to sink in. \"Boone\u0027s . . . impotent?\" Rix asked. The last time he\u0027d been home, Boone had taken him to a club called the Rooster Strut, where topless dancers gyrated in the harsh, hot lights and the beer tasted like dishwater. Boone had made a big show of calling all the girls by their first names, of bragging about how many he\u0027d laid. He remembered the way Boone had grinned, his teeth flashing in the strobe lights. \"You like me, don\u0027t you?\" She wiped one eye and left a trail of mascara. \"I could go to Atlanta with you. They\u0027d let you take me, they wouldn\u0027t try to stop you. Boone\u0027s scared of you. He told me so. I\u0027d be real good for you, Rix. You need a woman, and I wouldn\u0027t be like that last one you had. I wouldn\u0027t get crazy and cut my - \" \"Go back to your room,\" he said. He\u0027d been jolted by the memory of Sandra in the bathtub, and all that blood. The razor on the scarlet tiles. Blood on the walls. Her curly, ash-blond hair floating Puddin\u0027 popped her breasts out of the gown. They hung inches away from his face. \"Take \u0027em,\" she whispered huskily. \"You can, if you want to.\" She tried to guide his hands. He made a fist. \"No,\" he said, and knew he was the biggest fool who\u0027d ever lived. \"Just touch one. Just one.\" \"No.\" In an instant her face crumbled like wet cardboard. Her lower lip swelled. \"I . . . thought you liked me.\" \"I do, but you\u0027re my brother\u0027s wife.\" \"Are you queer?\" There was a nasty hint in her voice. \"I\u0027m not gay, no. But you and Boone have a problem. I\u0027m not getting in the middle of it.\" Her eyes narrowed into slits. Her mask of perfection fell off, and the real Puddin\u0027 was hiding behind it. \"You\u0027re just like the rest of \u0027em! You don\u0027t care \u0027bout nobody but your own damn self!\" She stood up, tugging drunkenly at her gown. \"Oh, you play so high and mighty, but you\u0027re just another goddamned Usher, through and through!\" \"Keep your voice down.\" Walen might sure as hell be getting a kick out of this! \"I\u0027ll shout if I want to!\" Still, she wasn\u0027t drunk enough to want to rouse Margaret Usher. She marched to the door, then turned back. \"Thanks for your help, Mr. Usher! I sure do appreciate it!\" She left the room in a proud fury, but the door closed with a bump instead of a slam. Rix lay back in the bed and grinned. So all of Boone\u0027s sexual crowing was just hot air! What a laugh! Boone\u0027s afraid of me? he thought. No way! But he will be, before I\u0027m through with him. Ten billion dollars, he mused, as sleep began to pull at him again. With that much money, a man could do anything he pleased. He could have undreamed-of power. There\u0027d be no more struggling at the typewriter, alternately playing God and Satan over paper characters. - no more hassles no more books no more agents\u0027 dirty looks - The strange singsong had come unbidden, a soft, seductive voice from the deepest recess of his mind. For an instant he was lulled by it, and he pictured himself stepping out of the limousine and striding toward the open doors of the armaments plant. Inside, military men, beautiful secretaries, and smiling sycophants were waiting to welcome him. No, he thought - and the image faded. No. Every cent of that money was tainted with blood. He would make his own way in the world, on his own strengths. He didn\u0027t need any blood money. But when he switched off the lamp and settled back to sleep, his last conscious thought was - ten billion dollars - An hour or so later, Puddin\u0027 was awakened from an uneasy sleep by the noise of rushing wind around the Gatehouse. She looked toward the door - and saw a shape interrupt the light that crept in from the corridor. She held her breath, waiting. The shape paused, then went on. Puddin\u0027 clutched her silk sheet; for some reason, she dared not open that door to see who walked the Gatehouse at this dead hour. She could smell Walen\u0027s stink in the room. Puddin\u0027 squeezed her eyes shut, and, as she drifted toward darkness, she called in a hoarse whisper for her momma.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/usher-s-passing/page-7.html","bookId":2474,"book":{"id":2474,"title":"Usher\u0027s Passing","description":"Storyline: In this most gothic of Robert McCammon\u0027s novels, setting is key: the continuing saga of the Usher family (descended from the brother of Roderick and Madeline of Edgar Poe\u0027s \"Fall of the House of Usher\") takes place in the weird and picturesque heart of the North Carolina mountains. The haughty, aristocratic Ushers live in a mansion near Asheville; the poor but crafty mountain folk (whose families are just as ancient) live on Briartop Mountain nearby. At harvest time, when the book\u0027s action unfolds, the mountains are a blaze of color. Add to the mixture a sinister history of mountain kids disappearing every year, a journalist investigating those disappearances, a monster called \"The Pumpkin Man,\" moldy books and paintings in a huge old library at the Usher estate, and a secret chamber with a strange device involving a brass pendulum and tuning forks--and you\u0027ve got a splendid recipe for atmospheric horror.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/usher-s-passing.jpg","author":"Robert McCammon","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/usher-s-passing.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:46:55 PM"}}
