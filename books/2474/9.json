{"id":82946,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\"PENNY FOR YOUR THOUGHTS,\" MARGARET USHER SAID BRIGHTLY.\n Rix snapped himself back. \"Just wandering,\" he told her, and took another bite of sausage from his breakfast plate. In fact, he\u0027d been thinking about what a gorgeous morning it was; they were sitting on the glass-enclosed breakfast porch at the rear of the Gatehouse, and from here the panorama of the gardens and the western mountain peaks was an unbroken blaze of color. Though it was only eight o\u0027clock, a black gardener in a straw hat was already hard at work, sweeping stray leaves from the field-stone paths that crisscrossed the gardens. Marble statues of cherubs, fauns, and satyrs pranced through the flowers.\n The sky was blue and clear. A squadron of ducks flew across Rix\u0027s field of view. The breakfast was good, the coffee strong, and Rix had enjoyed a restful sleep after Puddin\u0027 had left last night. When he\u0027d taken his vitamins this morning, he\u0027d looked in the mirror and seen that the bags under his eyes didn\u0027t look quite as severe. Or was that only his hopeful imagination? Anyway, he felt fine, and even his appetite had picked up, because he was finishing all of his breakfast. He\u0027d missed Cass\u0027s cooking in the year that he\u0027d been away.\n \"I heard Boone come in this morning,\" Margaret said. Today she wore only a light coating of makeup, to accentuate her cheekbones. \"About five, I think it was. You\u0027d be surprised what I can hear when the house is quiet.\"\n \"Really?\" Instantly, Rix was on guard. Did she mean she\u0027d heard him and Puddin\u0027? Probably not. Her room was at the far end of the hallway, with many rooms between them.\n \"I can certainly hear Boone and that woman fighting like cats and dogs.\" She shook her head, her red lips pressed together in disgust. \"Oh, I told him not to marry her! I told him he\u0027d be sorry, and you know I\u0027m never wrong. Well, he\u0027s sorry all right.\"\n \"Why doesn\u0027t he divorce her like he did those two others, if he\u0027s so unhappy?\"\n She carefully folded her napkin and placed it beside her plate. A maid came in and began to carry away the dirty dishes. \"Because,\" Margaret said after the maid had gone, \"there\u0027s no telling what that trollop would say about us if she was let off this estate. She\u0027s a drunken little fool, but she\u0027s been an Usher now for two years, four months, and twelve days. That\u0027s two years longer than either of the others. She knows . . . things about us that might find their way into print if she was allowed to run wild.\"\n \"You mean the Malady?\"\n Margaret\u0027s eyes clouded over. \"Yes, that. And more. Like how much money we\u0027re worth, and what our real-estate holdings are. She knows about the Caribbean island we own, the casino in Monte Carlo, the banks and the other companies. Boone has a mouth as big as a mountain. Can you imagine the headlines if there was a divorce? That little trollop wouldn\u0027t accept an out-of-court settlement, like the other two. She\u0027d go straight to the National Enquirer with all sorts of lurid lies.\"\n \"And lurid truths?\" Rix asked.\n \"You have a very bad attitude about your family, Rix. You should be proud of who you are, and of the contribution your ancestors have made to this country\u0027s survival.\"\n \"Right. Well, I\u0027ve always been the black sheep, haven\u0027t I? I think it\u0027s too late to act like a star-spangled drummer boy.\"\n \"Please don\u0027t mention flags,\" she said coldly. She was remembering, Rix knew, a photograph that had been in several North Carolina newspapers. In it, Rix had been wearing a Jefferson Airplane T-shirt and waving a black flag; his hair was down to his shoulders, and he was walking in the front row of a crowd of Vietnam war demonstrators at the University of North Carolina. The picture had been snapped just minutes before the police waded in to break up their peace rally. Before the fighting was over, nine kids had broken bones and Rix sat in the gutter with a knot the size of a hen\u0027s egg on his head, watching a sea of legs flow and ebb around him.\n The photograph had also appeared on the front page of the weekly Foxton Democrat, with a circle around Rix\u0027s head.\n Walen had gone through the roof like a Roman candle.\n \"You\u0027d do well to study the achievements of your ancestors,\" Margaret suggested. Rix listened politely, with no trace of surprise on his face. \"They\u0027d teach you a thing or two about family pride.\"\n \"And just how would I go about doing that, pray tell?\"\n She shrugged. \"You might start by reading some of those books that Walen brought from the Lodge\u0027s library. He\u0027s been studying the family documents for the past three months.\"\n \"What?\" Rix\u0027s heart gave a kick.\n \"Family documents. That\u0027s what Walen had the servants bring out of the Lodge. Dozens of old ledgers and diaries and things, from the collection of family records. There\u0027s a library in the Lodge\u0027s basement with thousands of them. I\u0027ve never seen it, of course, but Edwin\u0027s told me about it.\"\n Rix was stunned. Family documents? Right here in the Gatehouse? \"I thought you said you didn\u0027t know what those books were.\"\n \"Well, I don\u0027t know exactly what they are, or why Walen\u0027s been reading them. But I do know they came from the Lodge\u0027s library.\"\n \"You saw them?\" Steady, he told himself. Don\u0027t act too interested!\n \"Of course I saw them. I was here the morning they were brought in. Some of them are so mildewed they smell like dead fish.\"\n My God, Rix thought. He leaned his chin on his hand to keep from grinning. Family documents in the Gatehouse library! He\u0027d hoped he could find something in there worth his attention, but this was a godsend! No, hold on a minute. There was a rip in the silver lining. \"The library\u0027s locked,\" he reminded her. \"Even if I wanted to browse through those old books, I couldn\u0027t get in, could I?\"\n \"Well, Walen has insisted that he wants it kept locked. But, of course, Edwin has the set of master keys. We do have to get in to dust and vacuum, don\u0027t we? If we didn\u0027t, the smell of mildew from that room would take over the house.\" She blinked suddenly, and Rix knew she was thinking about Walen\u0027s reek. \"That was a nice breakfast, wasn\u0027t it?\" she asked, recovering quickly. \"Boone\u0027s going to be sorry he missed it.\"\n Rix was about to ask her more about the Lodge\u0027s basement library when he heard a faint, steady whining sound. Birds burst from the trees. The whining noise grew louder. He looked toward the sky as a gleaming silver Bell Jetcopter streaked over the Gatehouse, circled slowly, and then settled down out of sight on the helipad.\n \"Oh, that might be your sister!\" Margaret rose from her chair, craning to see. \"Kattrina\u0027s home!\" she trilled.\n But it wasn\u0027t Katt who came up the pathway. There were two men, one wearing a military uniform and the other in a dark business suit. The one in the business suit wore sunglasses and carried a black briefcase.\n \"It\u0027s just them again,\" Margaret said, sitting down. She sighed softly. \"They\u0027re here to see Walen.\"\n The two men walked briskly through the gardens, then around the Gatehouse toward the front entrance.\n \"Who are they?\" Rix asked.\n \"One\u0027s from the Pentagon. I think you\u0027ve met him before, but maybe not. General McVair. The other man is Mr. Meredith, from the armaments plant. Dr. Francis told your father he should have absolute rest, but Walen doesn\u0027t listen.\" She smiled at Rix, but her eyes were vacant. \"When your father pulls out of this thing, we\u0027re going on a vacation. Perhaps to Acapulco. That would be lovely in January, don\u0027t you think?\"\n \"Yes,\" he said, watching her carefully, \"it would be.\"\n \"It\u0027s sunny all the time in Acapulco. Your father needs a nice vacation. He needs to get out in the sun and laugh.\"\n \"Excuse me.\" Rix stood up. \"I think I might take a walk. Enjoy the fresh air.\"\n \"It\u0027s a lovely day for a walk, isn\u0027t it? You could go for a horseback ride, if you like.\"\n \"I\u0027ll find something to do. Thanks for the breakfast.\" He left his mother sitting on the porch; he couldn\u0027t bear the realization that she was living in a twilight world of false hopes and dreams, waiting for her husband to kick off the shroud and dance down the staircase like Fred Astaire. Her next trip would be to the Usher cemetery, on the eastern edge of the estate.\n But right now he wanted to find Edwin. He wanted to get that master key and see for himself what was beyond the library\u0027s door. He\u0027d have to be very careful; he didn\u0027t want anyone knowing what he intended to do, and now he regretted even telling Cass about it. If Walen ever got a hint he was going to shake some Usher coffins, the documents would be whisked back to the Lodge\u0027s basement. He stopped a maid and asked if she\u0027d seen Edwin, but she told him she hadn\u0027t.\n Rix went out of the Gatehouse. The sparkling air smelled like a fine, crisp white wine. Edwin might be any of a dozen places on the estate, commanding the hundred routine duties that went on every day. He walked through the gardens, taking the pathway that would lead him past the tennis courts to the Bodane house.\n He passed the garage, a long, low stone structure with ten wooden doors that each slid upward to allow a car into its separate stall. At one time the garage had housed Usher carriages and coaches; now it held Boone\u0027s red Ferrari, Katt\u0027s pink Maserati, the new limo, a second limo in case the first had mechanical trouble, a red \u002757 Thunderbird, a robin\u0027s-egg-blue \u002752 Cadillac, a white \u002748 Packard, a gray \u002732 Duesenberg, a Stutz Bearcat, and a Model T Ford in perfect condition. Those, anyway, were the cars that were in there the last time Rix had looked; the assemblage might have been upgraded during the past year.\n The Bodane house, tiny compared to the Gatehouse, but itself a two-story Victorian manor, was tucked back amid the trees. Next to it was a small white garage that held the Bodanes\u0027 Chevy station wagon. Rix walked up the steps to the front door and pressed the buzzer.\n The door opened. Edwin stood there, capless, but wearing his uniform. \"Rix,\" he said, and smiled - but there was pain in his eyes. \"Please come in.\"\n \"I\u0027m glad I caught you.\" Rix entered the house. At once a wave of nostalgia crashed over him. This house, like his bedroom, hadn\u0027t changed a bit: the walls were of softly glowing wood, adorned with samplers and needlepoint that Cass had done; the parlor floor was covered by a burgundy rug - threadbare in places - trimmed in gold; cozy, overstuffed chairs and a sofa were arranged around a red brick hearth where a small fire flickered; above the hearth was a wreath made of pine cones and acorns. The parlor\u0027s two large bay windows looked directly toward the Gatehouse.\n Rix had sat on that rug and dreamed before the hearth, while Cass read him stories, either Aesop\u0027s Fables or Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales. Cass could break your heart with \"The Brave Tin Soldier,\" or make you laugh at the greedy fox who wanted all the grapes. Edwin made the best hot chocolate in the world, and his hand on your shoulder felt as strong as courage. Where had all the years gone, Rix wondered, as he looked around the parlor. What had happened to the little boy who sat in front of that fireplace with dreams in his eyes?\n He had been swept into the furnace of reality with his ballerina bride, and all that remained was scorched metal.\n \"Did you want me for something?\" Edwin asked, breaking the spell.\n \"Yes, I - \" Something on the mantel caught his attention. He walked across the rug to it, and stood staring at a small framed photograph of himself at about seven or eight, wearing a suit and a bow tie, with his hair slicked back. On either side of him, holding his hands and smiling, were a much younger Edwin and Cass. A servant had taken that picture, he recalled. It was done on a hot July day - his birthday! His father and mother had gone to Washington on business, and taken Boone with them. Edwin and Cass had hosted a birthday party for him, inviting all the servants\u0027 children and Rix\u0027s friends from his private school in Asheville. He picked up the photograph and looked closely at it. Everyone was so happy then. The world was happy. There were no wars, or rumors of wars. No black banners or demonstrations or police riot batons. Life was stretched out like a red carpet.\n \"I\u0027d forgotten about this,\" Rix said softly. He looked from one face to the next, as Edwin came up behind him. Three happy people with linked hands, Rix thought. But there was another presence in the picture, something he\u0027d never realized before.\n Over Rix\u0027s left shoulder, jutting above the full summer trees, was one of the Lodge\u0027s towering chimneys. The Lodge had crashed his birthday party without his even knowing it.\n Rix returned the photograph to its place on the mantel. \"I\u0027d like to get the library key from you,\" he said, turning away from the hearth. \"Dad\u0027s offered me the use of the materials in there.\"\n \"Do you mean . . . the documents that your father brought out of the Lodge?\"\n \"Actually, I\u0027m just looking for something about Wales. And coal mining.\" Rix smiled. He felt his insides writhe. If there was anything on earth he hated to do, it was to lie to Edwin Bodane; but he feared that Edwin, out of loyalty to Walen, would balk at giving him the key if Rix told him the real reason. \"Do you think there\u0027s anything in the library on coal mines?\"\n \"There should be.\" He was searching Rix\u0027s eyes, and for a few seconds Rix felt that Edwin was seeing right through him. \"I think there\u0027s a book on every subject under the sun in there.\" Then he crossed the room to a shelf with a number of clay jars on it. One was marked CARS, another GROUNDSKEEPING, a third HOUSEHOLD, a fourth RECREATION - and the final three jars were all marked LODGE. He took the HOUSEHOLD jar down, opened it, and brought out a large ring of keys in all sizes and shapes. He found the key he wanted and started working it off the ring \"What\u0027s your next book idea about? Wales?\" he asked.\n \"That\u0027s where it\u0027s going to be set. It\u0027s about - don\u0027t laugh, now - vampires who live down in the old coal mines.\" Lie was following lie.\n \"Lord!\" Edwin said. An amused grin spread across his pliable features. \"How in the world did you come up with that one?\"\n Rix shrugged. \"That I can\u0027t tell you. Anyway, I\u0027ve just started my research. It might work out, or it might not.\"\n Edwin got the key off, returned the ring to the jar, and placed the jar on the shelf. As he offered it to Rix, he said quietly, \"Cass told me, Rix.\"\n Oh Christ! \"She did, huh?\"\n \"Yes. We talked about it last night.\"\n \"Okay, then,\" Rix said. \"What\u0027s your opinion?\"\n Edwin frowned. \"Opinion? Well, if you put it that way, my opinion is that Logan will do a fine job, once he teams some patience and discipline.\"\n \"Logan?\"\n \"That\u0027s who we\u0027re talking about, isn\u0027t it? Cass told me last night that she let you know about our retirement. I was going to tell you myself, on the ride from the airport, but I didn\u0027t want to burden you with anything else.\"\n Rix slipped the key into his trouser pocket, relieved. \"In other words, he\u0027s impatient and undisciplined?\"\n \"Logan is a young man,\" Edwin answered diplomatically. \"He doesn\u0027t put a high value on responsibility yet.\" He stepped past Rix to straighten the photograph on the mantel. \"He doesn\u0027t quite understand the meaning of tradition. One generation of Bodanes building for the next, ever since Hudson Usher hired a mountain man named Whitt Bodane as an assistant grounds-keeper. Within four years, Whitt was Usherland\u0027s chief of staff. I\u0027d hate to see that long tradition disrupted.\"\n \"So you think you can teach a nineteen-year-old boy everything you know?\"\n \"When I began as chief of staff, Usherland employed more than three hundred servants. Now there are fewer than eighty. I\u0027m not saying he won\u0027t make mistakes. Maybe I\u0027m not even saying that I\u0027m certain he\u0027ll work out. But I\u0027m going to do my damnedest to make Logan understand the importance of that tradition.\"\n \"I can\u0027t wait to meet him,\" Rix said with something less than enthusiasm.\n \"Good.\" Edwin glanced at his gold pocket watch. \"I was just cleaning his room upstairs. I\u0027m to pick him up in an hour, at Robert\u0027s farm. I could use the company, if you\u0027d like to go.\"\n Rix wanted to get into that library, but his curiosity burned about the young man who was to take Edwin\u0027s place. He decided it would be too risky to search through the documents in broad daylight. They could wait until night. \"All right,\" he agreed. \"I\u0027ll go.\"\n Edwin took his cap from a hatstand in the foyer and put it on. Then he and Rix went out into the warm morning sunlight, got into the tan station wagon, and drove away from Usherland. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/usher-s-passing/page-9.html","bookId":2474,"book":{"id":2474,"title":"Usher\u0027s Passing","description":"Storyline: \n In this most gothic of Robert McCammon\u0027s novels, setting is key: the continuing saga of the Usher family (descended from the brother of Roderick and Madeline of Edgar Poe\u0027s \"Fall of the House of Usher\") takes place in the weird and picturesque heart of the North Carolina mountains.
