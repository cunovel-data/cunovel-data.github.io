{"id":82940,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"NUDGING THE LOGS IN THE MARBLE FIREPLACE WITH A BRASS POKER, Boone glanced up at the sound of the opening doors and saw Rix in the gilt-framed mirror above the hearth. \"Ah!\" he said. \"Here\u0027s the famous horror author, Momma!\"\n Margaret Usher sat in a high-backed Italian armchair, facing the fire. She\u0027d been chilly all day, and she couldn\u0027t drive the cold from her bones. She did not turn to greet her son.\n The doors slid closed behind Rix, gently but still with the faint click! of a trap snapping shut. Now he was alone with them. He wore faded jeans and a pale blue shirt under a beige sweater - a good enough outfit for anywhere but here, he thought. Boone was dressed in a pinstriped suit, his mother in an elaborate blue and gold gown. \"Hello, Mother,\" Rix said.\n \"I\u0027m cold.\" She spoke as if she hadn\u0027t even heard. \"It\u0027s very cold in this house, don\u0027t you think?\"\n \"Want me to get you a sweater, Momma?\"\n She paused, her head cocked slightly to one side, pondering Boone\u0027s question. \"Yes,\" she said finally. \"A sweater would do nicely.\"\n \"Sure thing. Momma, show Rixy those pearls I brought you from New York.\" He put a finger under her chin to persuade her to lift her head. The strand of pearls glowed, catching golden light that filtered in through the large picture window overlooking the azalea garden. \"Nice, huh? They cost four thousand dollars.\"\n \"Very nice,\" Rix agreed. \"Boone brought me a couple of gifts in New York, too, Mother.\"\n Boone laughed without humor. \"How about that thing, Rixy? I thought you\u0027d like it! Pet shop two blocks from the De Peyser had just what I was looking for. Fella who sold it to me said it was just like the ones they use in monster flicks.\"\n \"I figure I screwed things up for you. You probably wanted me to find that thing first, and you thought the shock might trigger an attack. Then, when I went into the Quiet Room, I\u0027d stumble into your second surprise.\"\n \"Don\u0027t say that word.\" Margaret was staring fixedly into the fire. \" \u0027Screwed\u0027 is not a decent word.\" Her voice was calm and throaty - the voice of a woman used to giving commands.\n \"It\u0027s not the kind of word a famous author ought to use, is it, Momma?\" As always, Boone leaped on every opportunity to score points with their mother against Rix. \"Now you just sit right there and I\u0027ll run get you a sweater.\" When he passed Rix on his way to the door, Boone flashed a quick, tight smile.\n \"Boone?\" Margaret called, and her older son paused. \"Make sure the sweater won\u0027t clash, dear.\"\n \"Yes, Momma,\" Boone replied, and left the room.\n Rix walked toward her. As he neared, he again caught a whiff of that foul aroma, like a dead rat moldering in one of the walls. Margaret picked up a can of Lysol pine air freshener from a table beside her chair and began to spray clouds of mist around her. When she was through, the room smelled like a pine woods full of dead animals.\n Rix stood beside his mother. She was still trying to stall time. At fifty-eight, Margaret Usher was desperately fighting to remain thirty-five. Her hair was cut stylishly short and dyed a coppery auburn. Several trips to a California plastic surgeon had left the skin stretched so tightly over her sharp cheekbones that it looked as if it were about to rip. Her makeup was thicker than Rix recalled, and the shade of lipstick she\u0027d chosen was much too red. Tiny lines were creeping around her mouth and nesting in the corners of her pale green eyes. Her body remained sleek except for a bit of heaviness around the hips and stomach, and Rix remembered Katt telling him his mother feared unsightly flab like the Black Plague. On her slim, graceful hands she wore a stunning variety of rings - diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. Pinned to her gown was a brooch whose diamonds glittered in the firelight. Sitting motionless, she appeared to Rix as yet another perfect furnishing of the Gatehouse, never meant to be touched.\n Her expression was disconsolate and helpless. A feeling of sadness for her came over Rix. What price had she paid, he wondered, to live as the mistress of Usherland?\n Suddenly she turned her head and looked at him. It was the same kind of vague stare one would give a stranger. \"You\u0027ve lost weight,\" she noted. \"Have you been sick?\"\n \"I\u0027ve felt better.\"\n \"You look like a walking skeleton.\"\n He shrugged uneasily, not wanting to be reminded of his physical ailments. \"I\u0027ll be all right.\"\n \"Not living the way you do. Hand to mouth in a distant city, without your family. I don\u0027t see how you\u0027ve stood it this long.\" A light glimmered in her eyes, and she reached out to take his hand. \"But you\u0027ve come home to stay this time, haven\u0027t you? We\u0027ve needed you here. I\u0027ve had your old room readied for you. Everything\u0027s just as it used to be, now that you\u0027re home to stay.\"\n \"Mom,\" Rix said gently, \"I can\u0027t stay. I just came for a few days, to see Dad.\"\n \"Why?\" Her grip tightened. \"Why can\u0027t you stay here, where you belong?\"\n \"I don\u0027t belong at Usherland.\" He knew it was pointless to be drawn into this discussion yet again. Inevitably there would be an argument. \"I\u0027ve got to get back to work.\"\n \"You mean that writing you do?\" Margaret released his hand and stood up to admire her new pearls in the mirror. \"I\u0027d hardly call that work, Rix. At least not the kind of occupation you\u0027re capable of. Did you see these pearls your brother brought me? Aren\u0027t they nice?\" She frowned and ran a finger beneath her chin. \"My God, I\u0027m looking like an old woman, aren\u0027t I? I should sue that last doctor who tucked my chin. I should sue him right out of business. Aren\u0027t I just the ugliest old woman you\u0027ve ever seen?\"\n \"You look fine.\"\n She regarded herself and smiled wanly. \"Oh, you don\u0027t remember what I used to look like. Do you know what my daddy always called me? The prettiest girl in the whole of North Carolina. Puddin\u0027 thinks she\u0027s pretty, but she doesn\u0027t know what real beauty is.\" Margaret mentioned the name of Boone\u0027s wife with an undisguised disgust. \"I used to look like Katt. I used to have fine skin, just like hers.\"\n \"Where is Katt?\"\n \"Didn\u0027t your brother tell you? She\u0027s gone down to the Bahamas somewhere on an assignment for a magazine. It was something she couldn\u0027t get out of. She hoped to get back either tomorrow or the day after. Do you know what they\u0027re paying her now? Two thousand dollars an hour. They\u0027re going to put her on the cover of Vogue next month. I used to look like Katt when I was her age.\"\n \"And what about Puddin\u0027?\"\n \"What about her?\" Margaret shrugged, uninterested. \"She\u0027s up in her room, I suppose. She sleeps all the time. I\u0027ve tried to tell Boone his little beauty-queen wife is beginning to drink a bit too much, but will he listen? No. He goes running off to the stables to clock the horses.\" She picked up the Lysol can and misted the air again. \"At least you\u0027re a free man. Your brother\u0027s made a mess of his - \"\n The doors slid open and Boone entered, carrying a pale gold sweater. The way Margaret immediately closed her mouth and stiffened her spine was a clear message that she\u0027d been discussing him. Boone wore his toothy grin like a mask. \"Here\u0027s your sweater, Momma.\" He draped it around her shoulders. \"What mischief you two been talkin\u0027 about?\"\n \"Oh, nothing that concerns you,\" Margaret said sweetly, her eyelids at half-mast. \"Rix was just telling me about all the ladies in his life. He\u0027s playing his cards right.\"\n Boone\u0027s mouth stretched wider, and Rix could almost hear the flesh crack. In his eyes was a familiar warning glint; Rix had seen it many times when they were children, just before Boone attacked him for some imagined slight. \"What Momma means to say, Rixy, is that I\u0027m the disgrace of the family - next to you, that is. Because I\u0027ve been divorced twice and I\u0027ve married a young chickie, Momma seems to think I ought to go through life carrying a ball and chain. Isn\u0027t that right, Momma?\"\n \"Don\u0027t make a fool of yourself in front of your brother, dear.\"\n \"Know why Rixy\u0027s got so many ladies, Momma? \u0027Cause none of \u0027em go out with him a second time. His idea of a fun date is to amble over to the nearest graveyard and hunt up the spooks. And let\u0027s don\u0027t forget that little lady of Rix\u0027s who decided to take a nice warm - \"\n Rix wheeled toward him. He felt the rage contorting his face. Boone stopped dead. \"Don\u0027t say it,\" Rix whispered hoarsely. \"If you say it, you bastard, I\u0027ll have to kill you.\"\n Boone stood like stone. Then he laughed, the note sharp and short - but there was a tremor in it.\n \"Boys,\" Margaret chided softly. \"Is there a draft in this room?\"\n Boone ambled over and warmed his hands before the hearth. \"Know what, Momma? Rix says he\u0027s finished another book.\"\n \"Oh?\" Her voice was stiff with frost. \"I presume it\u0027s another disgusting bloodfest. I swear, I don\u0027t know why you write those things! Do you actually think those books of yours please people?\"\n Rix had a headache. He touched his temples, fearing an attack. My God, why did I come home? he asked himself. Boone\u0027s reference to Sandra had almost sent him over the edge.\n \"You\u0027ve got to understand Rixy, Momma,\" Boone offered, his gaze flicking back and forth between them. \"He was always scared of his own shadow when we were kids. Always seein\u0027 the Pumpkin Man under his bed. So now he writes horror books so he can kill off the bad ol\u0027 demons. And he thinks he\u0027s Edgar Allan Poe. You know, the sufferin\u0027 art - \"\n \"Hush!\" she said sharply. \"Don\u0027t you dare mention that name in this house! Lord knows, your father would have a fit if he heard it!\"\n \"Well, it\u0027s true!\" Boone insisted. He grinned at Rix, rubbing his hands together. \"When are you gonna write somethin\u0027 about us, Rixy? That\u0027s about what I\u0027d expect of you next.\"\n From the corner of his eye, Rix saw his mother blanch. He responded with a smug smile of his own. \"You know, brother Boone, that might be a fine idea. I could write a book about the Ushers. The history of the family. How about that, Mom?\"\n She opened her mouth to reply, then abruptly clapped it shut. She sprayed the air again, and Rix smelled the new, almost overpowering stench that had crept in under the doors.\n \"It\u0027s so hard,\" Margaret said as she followed the mist around the room, \"to keep an older house fresh and clean. When a house reaches a certain age, it starts to fall to pieces. I\u0027ve always cared about keeping a good house.\" She stopped spraying; it was clear the disinfectant wasn\u0027t strong enough. \"My mother raised me to care,\" she said proudly.\n Rix had delayed the moment as long as possible. \"I\u0027d better go up and see him now,\" he said resignedly.\n \"No, not yet!\" Margaret clutched his hand, a tight false smile across her mouth. \"Let\u0027s sit down here together, both my fine boys. Cass is making a Welsh pie for you. She knows how much you like them.\"\n \"Mom, I have to go upstairs.\"\n \"He\u0027s probably sleeping. Mrs. Reynolds says he needs his sleep. Let\u0027s sit down and talk about pleasant things, all right?\"\n \"Oh, let him go on upstairs, Momma,\" Boone said silkily, watching Rix. \"After he sees what Daddy looks like, he can go write himself another one of those horror - \"\n \"You shut your mouth!\" Margaret whirled toward him. \"You\u0027re a cruel boy, Boone Usher! At least your brother wants to pay his respects to Walen, which is more than you\u0027ll do!\" Boone looked away from his mother\u0027s wrath, and muttered something under his breath.\n Rix said, \"I\u0027d better go up.\" Tears glinted like tiny diamonds in his mother\u0027s eyes, and he reached out to touch her cheek.\n \"Don\u0027t,\" she said, quickly pulling her head back. \"You\u0027ll muss my hair.\"\n He slowly withdrew his hand. It never changes here, he thought. They draw you in some way or another, and then they try to crush the feelings out of you, like stepping on a bug. He shook his head and walked past her, out of the living room and along the hallway to the central staircase. It wound upward to bedrooms and parlors that had been used by Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Hoover, and a score of government and Pentagon luminaries, both famous and infamous.\n As he climbed the stairs, dread at seeing his father gnawed at his insides. He didn\u0027t know what to expect. Why did Walen want to see him, he wondered. The old man hated him for leaving Usherland, and Rix despised what Usher Armaments stood for. What could they possibly have to talk about now?\n On the second floor, the smell of decay was stronger. He passed by his old room without pausing to look inside. Brightly colored flowers and greenery were placed in crystal vases all along the corridor, in a vain attempt to mask the stench. Moody oil paintings - including War Clouds by Victor Hallmark, After the Battle by Rutledge Taylorson, and Blood on the Snow by George H. Nivens - lined the walls as testimonial to Walen Usher\u0027s bleak taste in art. At the end of the corridor, another staircase ascended to a single white door - the Gatehouse\u0027s Quiet Room.\n Rix stood at the foot of the stairs, gathering his courage. The odor of decomposition drifted around him, a foul miasma. Nothing that smelled like that, Rix thought, could still be alive.\n The last time Rix had seen his father, Walen Usher had been the tall, ramrod-straight figure of authority that Rix knew from his childhood. Age had done nothing to diminish the power of his gaze or the strength of his voice, and his rugged, rough-hewn features might have been those of a man in his early forties except for swirls of gray at his temples and a few deepening lines across his high, aristocratic forehead. Walen Usher\u0027s jaw jutted like the prow of a battleship, and his mouth was a thin grim line that rarely broke into a smile.\n Rix had never been able to understand how his father\u0027s mind worked. They had no common ground, no means of easy communication. Walen ran the estate and the business with a dictator\u0027s firm control. He had always kept his various business projects a secret from the family, and when Rix had been a child, there were long periods of time when Walen locked himself into his study and didn\u0027t come out. Rix knew only that a lot of military men visited his father behind locked doors.\n When Walen was around, he treated his children as if they were soldiers in his private army. There were predawn military-style inspections, strict codes of conduct, dress, and manners and savage verbal attacks if his children failed in any way. His most vicious assaults had been against Rix, when the boy was deemed lazy or uncooperative.\n If Rix \"talked back,\" failed to keep his shoes brightly polished, was late to the dinner table, or committed some other infraction of the unwritten rules, then the broad leather strap that his father called the Peacemaker raised red welts across his legs and buttocks - usually with Boone smirking in the same room, behind Walen\u0027s shoulder. Boone, on the other hand, was a master at playing the perfect son, always dressed immaculately, always neat and clean and fawning around his father. Kattrina had learned the art of bending to whatever wind Walen blew, and so escaped much of the abuse. Margaret, ever busy with planning parties and charity events, knew it was best to stay out of Walen\u0027s way, and had never taken Rix\u0027s side against him. Rules, she would say, were rules.\n Once, Rix had seen Walen knock a servant to the floor and kick him in the ribs for some imagined dereliction of duty. If Edwin hadn\u0027t intervened, Walen might have killed the man. Sometimes, late at night when the rest of the house had gone to sleep, Rix had lain in his bed and heard his father walking the corridor outside his room, pacing back and forth in some mind-less expenditure of nervous energy. He feared the night when his father would throw open his door and set on him, rage burning in his eyes, with the same fury that had made him break their servant\u0027s ribs.\n But in mellow moods, Walen would summon Rix to his huge bedroom, where the walls were painted dark red and the furnishings were heavy black Victorian monstrosities brought from the Lodge, and order Rix to read to him from the Bible. What Walen wanted to hear were not chapters that had to do with spiritual things, but instead were long, tongue-twisting lineages: who begat who begat who. He demanded them over and over again and sometimes the ebony cane he carried would smack the floor with impatience when Rix stumbled over the names.\n When he was ten, Rix had run away from home after a particularly nasty meeting with the Peacemaker. Edwin had found him at the Trailways bus station in Foxton; they\u0027d had a long talk, and as Rix collapsed into tears, Edwin held him and promised that Walen would never hit him again, so long as Edwin lived. The vow had remained intact for all these years, though Walen\u0027s taunts had increased. Rix was still the failure, the black sheep, the weakling who whined that the Ushers had thrived and gotten fat on generations of the dead.\n Rix\u0027s heart was pounding as he forced himself up the steps. A hand-lettered sign had been taped to the door: TAP QUIETLY, Beside the door was a table bearing a box of green surgical masks.\n He put his hand on the doorknob and then abruptly drew it back. Corruption oozed out of that room; he could feel it, like furnace heat. He didn\u0027t know if he could take what was waiting In there for him, and suddenly his resolve slipped away. He started back down the stairs.\n But in another second the decision was made for him.\n The knob turned from the other side, and the door opened. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/usher-s-passing/page-3.html","bookId":2474,"book":{"id":2474,"title":"Usher\u0027s Passing","description":"Storyline: \n In this most gothic of Robert McCammon\u0027s novels, setting is key: the continuing saga of the Usher family (descended from the brother of Roderick and Madeline of Edgar Poe\u0027s \"Fall of the House of Usher\") takes place in the weird and picturesque heart of the North Carolina mountains.
