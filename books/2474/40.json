In the air was the chlorine odor of ozone, and dust whirled up from a distant field. Rix walked up the front steps and pressed the door buzzer. He carried the notebook and the newspaper account of Cynthia Usher\u0027s death under his arm. As he waited, Rix glanced uneasily down Dunstan\u0027s gravel driveway. He\u0027d passed a brown van that was pulled off the road, about twenty yards from the entrance to the driveway, and he recalled seeing the same van a few days before. Was Dunstan\u0027s house being watched? he wondered, scanning the woods. If so, whoever it was had seen him in a highly visible Usher vehicle. Another concern nagged at him as well. When he\u0027d gone out to the garage, he\u0027d seen that Katt\u0027s car was missing. Had she gone to Asheville to score more heroin? Boone\u0027s Ferrari had been gone, too, but Rix figured he was sleeping off a bad night at the country club. He pressed the buzzer again, then turned to watch the woods at his back. Anyone spying certainly had a clear view of him. \"Who is it?\" Dunstan asked from the other side of the door. \"Rix Usher.\" Locks clicked open. Dunstan, the corncob pipe clamped firmly between his teeth, guided his chair backward to allow Rix entry. Rix stepped in and closed the door behind him. \"Lock it,\" Dunstan said, and Rix did. \"Sorry it took me so long to get up here. I been workin\u0027 since way before daylight.\" He looked strained, with dark circles beneath his eyes. He glanced at the items Rix held. \"What\u0027ve you got?\" \"First this.\" Rix handed him the fragile newspaper pages. \"It\u0027s an account of Cynthia\u0027s death in Chicago.\" Dunstan took his chair into the parlor, where the light was better, and Rix followed. The last red embers of a fire glowed brightly in the hearth. \"Okay,\" he said when he\u0027d finished reading, \"this clears up one question. What about the scepter?\" Rix sat down and told him the story that Edwin had related. Dunstan listened intently, blue whorls of smoke curling above his head. When Rix had finished, Dunstan\u0027s flinty stare was impassive. \"I need documents to prove all that,\" he said. \"Edwin says the clippings are in the Lodge\u0027s library.\" \"Don\u0027t do me much good there. Can you get \u0027em for me?\" \"Edwin might be able to. I\u0027ll ask him.\" He offered Dunstan the black notebook. \"I wanted you to look at this, too.\" He opened it and slowly paged through it, his brow furrowing. \"This come from the Lodge\u0027s library? What\u0027s all this figurin\u0027 mean?\" \"I hoped you\u0027d be able to tell me.\" \"Nope. Sorry. What\u0027re these drawin\u0027s here?\" He tapped the page of sketches. \"I think they\u0027re clock pendulums. But why they\u0027re in that book, and what they mean, I don\u0027t know.\" \"Ludlow was always interested in clocks,\" Dunstan mused. \"Kept \u0027em around him all the time. Could be this is one of his notebooks, but I can\u0027t make any sense out of this arithmetic or the music notes.\" He placed the book on his lap and looked up at Rix. \"You know that Ludlow was an inventor. Supposedly he was always workin\u0027 on somethin\u0027 down in that workshop of his in the Lodge. Could be this is one of his projects.\" \"You mean a weapon of some kind?\" \"Who can say? I\u0027ve heard that visitors to Usherland sometimes saw sparks jumpin\u0027 off those lightnin\u0027 rods on the roof. Ludlow locked himself in his workshop for days at a time. There\u0027s no tellin\u0027 what he was up to, but more than likely it had somethin\u0027 to do with the business.\" Rix took the notebook back from Dunstan and examined the sketches again. \"If it\u0027s a weapon,\" Dunstan said, \"what would music have to do with it?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Rix replied - but he was already forming a theory. Shann had been a musical prodigy. The Usher Concerto had affected people in a way that drove them to suicide like lemmings. When Ludlow had gone to visit her in New Orleans, had he been trying to tap into Shann\u0027s musical ability for the Pendulum project? Was that why he\u0027d wanted her to renounce the convent and return to Usherland? There was no way to find out unless he learned what Pendulum was. \"Yesterday,\" Rix said, \"you mentioned another question you have about my family. You said it was an important question. I\u0027d like to hear it.\" Dunstan rolled his chair to the hearth and used a poker to probe at the remaining bits of charred wood. Then he returned the poker to its stand with the other fireplace tools and paused thoughtfully before answering. He swung the chair around to face Rix. \"I saw Walen before your grandfather died. He was handsome, full of energy. Looked like he could take on the world with one hand tied behind his back.\" He struck a match and relit his pipe. \"A month after Erik died, Walen\u0027s limo had a flat tire a block away from the Democrat office. I moseyed out to take a look, while Edwin Bodane used a pay phone to call for another car. I got one glimpse of Walen before he pulled the curtain across his window.\" He looked long and hard at Rix. \"It wasn\u0027t the same man.\" Rix frowned. \"What do you mean? It wasn\u0027t Walen?\" \"Oh, it was Walen, all right. But an old, broken-down Walen. I\u0027ll never forget his eyes - he looked like he\u0027d had a visit from the Devil himself. He had that cane in his hand; I remember that, too. But I\u0027ve never seen such a change in a man in so short a time.\" \"I suppose Erik\u0027s death affected him.\" \"Why should it? From what I understand, Walen wasn\u0027t a doting son. Now listen to this: Erik had a nervous breakdown on the night of Ludlow\u0027s death. It was during one of Erik\u0027s fancy parties. Ludlow called him up to the Quiet Room. A couple of hours later, some of the guests heard hell breakin\u0027 loose in Erik\u0027s study. They got in and found Erik havin\u0027 a fit - smashin\u0027 furniture, throwin\u0027 things against the walls. It took four or five men to hold him down till somebody could call a doctor. Then Erik locked himself away for a month.\" Dunstan lifted his eyebrows quizzically. \"Why?\" he asked. \"Erik hated Ludlow. Why would Ludlow\u0027s death drive him crazy?\" \"It shouldn\u0027t have,\" Rix said. \"If anything, I\u0027d think Erik would\u0027ve danced with joy.\" \"Right. Erik did everything he could to hurry along his father\u0027s death. And Walen was no better a son; he wouldn\u0027t have lifted a finger to help Erik. Why, then, did both of them react the way they did?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Neither do I. Nor does anybody else. But I\u0027ll tell you what I think.\" Dunstan leaned forward, his eyes bright blue and intense. \"Somethin\u0027 passed from father to son at the last minute. Maybe some kind of information, or some responsibility that neither Erik nor Walen figured on. I think Ludlow told Erik somethin\u0027 in that Quiet Room, right before he died, that almost drove Erik insane.\" \"And Erik passed whatever it was to Walen before he died?\" \"Yes. Which is why Walen\u0027s health broke right after his father died. Both Erik and Walen were okay again, with the passage of time. Maybe the shock of it wore off, or they just went on because they had no choice. My question is, what\u0027s passed from father to son, just before the patriarch dies?\" \"The cane,\" Rix said. It seemed an obvious answer. \"No, it\u0027s more than that. The cane\u0027s no surprise. I think this is somethin\u0027 that\u0027s hidden until the last minute - some responsibility that needs to be carried on from one generation to the next. I\u0027ve asked Edwin about it, but of course he won\u0027t say. He just brings the documents, leaves \u0027em, and then picks \u0027em up again when I\u0027m through.\" He folded his hands before him. \"The answer may be in the Lodge\u0027s library. I need to find it.\" \"I can\u0027t go into the Lodge, not after what happened to me when I was a boy.\" \"But you could go in with Edwin, couldn\u0027t you? He could take you down to that library.\" Rix shrugged. The idea of entering the Lodge, even with Edwin, made his stomach ache with dread. \"I don\u0027t know. But what would I be looking for?\" \"Business records. Property titles. Anything on Hudson Usher. Maybe something about the ancestors in Wales. Aram\u0027s marriage to Shann\u0027s mother, in San Francisco. He met her when he went there to find his Aunt Madeline, against Hudson\u0027s strict orders. Maybe documents on the Pennsylvania estate, and Roderick\u0027s death. It\u0027s supposed to be an Usher museum down there, and if there\u0027s an answer to the question in any written form - that\u0027s most likely where it\u0027ll be.\" Rix ran his hand over the notebook\u0027s moldy cover. From outside, the boom of thunder sounded nearer. If he did find the courage to enter the Lodge again, he told himself, it would have to be for a damned good reason. \"I want to see your manuscript now,\" he said. \"Not yet. I\u0027ll show it to you when you bring me what I want to see.\" Rix looked up into the other man\u0027s stem, set expression. He realized suddenly, with a twist of anger in his guts, that Wheeler Dunstan was playing with him, using him as an errand boy with no intention of letting him share in the book. \"Now,\" Rix demanded. \"I\u0027ve already risked enough for you. I could search through that library for a year and never find what you\u0027re looking for! If my father finds out what I\u0027m doing, he\u0027ll - \" \"Disinherit you?\" Dunstan asked slyly. \"I thought you had no interest in the business.\" Rix winced inwardly at the sarcasm in Dunstan\u0027s voice, and now he damned himself for ever getting involved with the man. Even if he did hope, deep in his soul, that he might get a sizable chunk of the Usher fortune, he\u0027d be finished if the house was being watched. He had to salvage something out of the wreckage! \"Now you listen to me,\" he said coldly. \"I\u0027ve proven to you that I can help you write this book. I think I deserve to read the manuscript.\" \"No. I\u0027m not letting anyone see it until it\u0027s finished.\" \"You don\u0027t know what I\u0027ve put on the line by being here, damn it!\" Rix rose angrily from his chair. \"I\u0027m not working for you! If you want me to go in the Lodge and do your dirty work for you, you\u0027re going to have to show me what you\u0027ve written already! I won\u0027t risk anything more until I see the manuscript for myself!\" Dunstan opened his mouth to speak again - and then his face seemed to freeze, his eyes glazing over as if he were staring right through Rix. One hand slowly came up and took the pipe from between his teeth. And in a strange, eerily emotionless voice, Dunstan said, \"I won\u0027t show my book to anyone.\" \"There won\u0027t be a book worth publishing if you don\u0027t let me help you!\" Rix snapped. \"Who\u0027s going to bring you documents after Edwin leaves?\" Dunstan\u0027s face remained masklike. \"I won\u0027t show my book to anyone,\" he repeated. Rix was angry enough to strike him, but the man seemed to be in some kind of trance. What the hell\u0027s wrong with him? Rix thought. Raven had never seen the manuscript, either. Why not? What was Dunstan trying to conceal? Rix glanced at Dunstan\u0027s shirt pocket, where he kept his office key with the little typewriter charm on it. Rix walked purposefully toward the man, who seemed not to even acknowledge his presence, then stepped quickly behind the chair and thrust his hand into Dunstan\u0027s pocket. His fingers closed around the typewriter charm - but as he brought his hand out, Dunstan suddenly gripped it with a strength that almost crushed Rix\u0027s knuckles. Rix\u0027s hand opened, and the key ring hit the armrest and fell to the floor. Before Dunstan could swivel his chair around, Rix retrieved the key ring. \"All right, damn you!\" Rix said fiercely. \"Now I\u0027ll see it for myself!\" He strode toward the corridor and the door to the basement. Thunder crashed near the house. Rix heard the clang of metal against metal, and twisted around. Dunstan was coming at him in the wheelchair, the fireplace poker raised in his hand. Still, Dunstan\u0027s face was remote, expressionless. He was moving like a machine on wheels. \"Come on!\" Rix said incredulously. \"What the hell do you think you\u0027re - \" The poker flashed downward in a vicious arc. Rix reacted too slowly, and was struck hard on the shoulder. Pain coursed through his arm, and he staggered backward. Dunstan swung again. Rix ducked to one side, and the poker narrowly missed his skull. \"Stop it!\" Rix shouted. The old man had lost his mind! Before Dunstan could lift the poker again, Rix grasped the chair\u0027s armrests to shove him across the floor - but Dunstan\u0027s free hand clamped around his wrist like an iron manacle. The dead eyes stared up into Rix\u0027s face. \"I won\u0027t show my book to anyone,\" he repeated, in a hoarse and strangled voice. He brought the poker up for another blow. Rix grabbed at it, throwing his weight against the side of the chair. It tipped over, spilling Wheeler Dunstan onto the floor. Lifting himself on his powerful forearms, Dunstan began to drag himself after Rix. Stunned, Rix retreated before him. Dunstan pulled himself forward, his face still set and glistening with sweat. Rix backed away, into the corridor. The door to the basement was only a few feet away. He went through it and down the ramp as Dunstan gave a guttural cry. In the clutter of Dunstan\u0027s office, Rix realized the original manuscript could be hidden anywhere. There was no way to find it without tearing the place apart - but the word processor was still on, and displayed on the green-glowing screen was what Dunstan had been writing before Rix had interrupted him. Rix approached the desk, shoving aside a stack of papers to get a good look. What he saw brought a dazed half-laugh, half-moan from his throat. There was one paragraph: Time will tell the tale. There will always be war, and someone will always make the weapons. Time will tell the tale. The Usher name is a deterrent to war. Time will tell the tale. The paragraph was repeated over and over, in various combinations of sentences. With a trembling hand, Rix pressed the terminal\u0027s key that scrolled the screen down. It obeyed, and Rix read the essence of the Usher family history that Dunstan had been writing for six years. The Usher name is a deterrent to war. Time will tell the tale. There will always be war, and someone will always make the weapons. Time will tell the tale. It went on and on, page after page. \"Oh Jesus,\" Rix whispered. There was no book. There had never been a book. Wheeler Dunstan was insane. Had he come down here, day after day for six years, and thought he was writing a complete manuscript? There will always be war, and someone will always make the weapons. Time will tell the tale - Rix ran from the basement and up the ramp, his heart hammering so loudly he could hardly think. In the parlor, the wheelchair still lay on its side, but the man had crawled away. The poker was on the floor, near the notebook Rix had dropped. He picked the book up. Outside, thunder crashed and rain began to slam against the roof. Within seconds, a downpour started that was so dense he couldn\u0027t see his car through the bay windows. As Rix neared the front door, he saw Dunstan lying on his face on the floor, his arms curled beneath his body. To leave the house, Rix would have to pass him. Dunstan\u0027s body suddenly trembled, and then he slowly turned his face toward Rix. Dunstan\u0027s eyes had rolled back in his head, showing only the bloodshot whites. Sweat gleamed on his pallid cheeks and forehead. His mouth gasped for air, then formed barely intelligible words: \"I won\u0027t . . . show my book . . . to anyone.\" He brought his right hand up from under his body. In it was an Usher .357 Commando. Rix leaped to one side as the gun went off. A fist-sized hole spouted shards of wood from the parlor wall. Rix crouched on the floor behind the meager protection of a chair, the fireplace at his back. The Commando held five more bullets. Over the drumming of the rain, Rix heard Dunstan dragging himself across the floor. He tensed to run for the corridor, but the fallen wheelchair was in the way. If he tripped over it, Dunstan could put a shot right through his back. He looked wildly around for something with which to protect himself. The fireplace shovel leaned against the health. Rix glanced at the red embers, then took the shovel and scooped up ashes and fragments of smoking wood. Rix waited, listening to the slow slide of Dunstan\u0027s body. He would get only one chance; if he didn\u0027t calculate it exactly, Dunstan would blow him away. His pores leaked cold sweat; still he waited, trying to visualize how and where Dunstan would be lying. He heard the man shove aside a piece of furniture; a lamp clattered to the floor. Wait, he told himself. Lightning flashed outside the windows, followed almost at once by a roll of thunder that shook the house. The sound of Dunstan\u0027s dragging body stopped. And Rix thought: Now! With a burst of adrenaline, he shoved the chair forward with his shoulder. Across the room, Dunstan fired; the bullet tore through the fabric inches from Rix\u0027s face, spraying him with smoking cotton. Before Dunstan could readjust his aim, Rix rose up and flung the embers. The other man got off a third wild shot as the embers scattered across his face and the front of his shirt. The bullet whined past Rix\u0027s head, smashing one of the bay windows. Rain and wind swept into the room. Then Dunstan was writhing on the floor, the embers sizzling on his cheeks and scorching through his shirt. Rix grasped his wrist and tried to shake the Commando loose. Dunstan\u0027s other hand came up, grabbing at Rix\u0027s sweater. Rix brought his fist down on the man\u0027s elbow - once, twice, and again, as hard as he could strike. Dunstan\u0027s fingers opened, and the Commando fell to the floor. Rix picked it up and scrambled away from the man. \"All right,\" he said huskily. \"It\u0027s over.\" Dunstan stared blankly up at him, red welts across his cheeks and forehead. Then his face collapsed and he began sobbing like a child. Rix couldn\u0027t bear to look at him; he emptied the three remaining cartridges from the Commando into his pocket, then put the gun out of Dunstan\u0027s reach, atop the mantel. At the rear of the house, Rix found a telephone and dialed the operator, asking for the sheriffs office. The line crackled and hissed with static. When the telephone was answered, Rix said there had been an accident at the Dunstan house near Taylorville, and hung up as the woman asked his name. There was nothing more he could do. He thought of calling Raven, but what could he say to her? Sorry, but her father was insane and had tried to kill him, and there had never been a book? His nerves were jangling as he returned to the parlor. Dunstan lay on his side, breathing shallowly, his stare fixed and vacant. Rix stood over the man, as wind and rain slashed at him through the shattered window. Rage stirred within him, gathered and coiled. He had cooperated with Dunstan for nothing, had risked whatever inheritance he might receive for an Usher history that had never existed. Dunstan gave a soft, tormented moan. One arm was flung out at his side, the fist tightly closed. He made a fool of me, Rix seethed. Because of him, I risked everything! The brown van. If Dunstan\u0027s house was being watched by someone that Walen sent, then . . . Rix\u0027s hands clenched at his sides, his nails digging crescent moons into the skin of his palms. And from deep within him, from that dark stranger in himself that he did not know and had denied existed inside his skin, came the urge to kill. He looked at the gun on the mantel. One shot would do it. The barrel pressed against Dunstan\u0027s skull, the man\u0027s blood and brains running with the raindrops on the wall. One shot. - do it now - Rix looked into his hand. He\u0027d brought the three bullets out of his pocket. - do it now - Lightning streaked, hit the earth somewhere close. Thunder filled the house. Rix held the Commando. He started to slide a bullet into the chamber. - do it now - He clicked the cylinder shut. Sweat and rain streamed down his face. The gun felt good in his hand; it felt like power - absolute, unyielding power. He turned toward Wheeler Dunstan, walked to him, and aimed the gun downward at his head. One shot. Do it now. His hand was shaking. A cold rage had taken control of him, yet he seemed detached, as though watching himself from a distance. The dark stranger in his soul whispered urgently for him to squeeze the trigger. This was no longer Raven\u0027s father lying on the floor; this was Walen Usher\u0027s bitterest enemy, and because of him Rix had put all his faith in a nonexistent book. He had risked everything to help Dunstan - and now he would be cut off from the Usher fortune without a dime. His finger tightened on the trigger. Dunstan moaned, and his fist began to open. In the palm was a silver button. It was one of the buttons from Rix\u0027s sweater, and he realized Dunstan had yanked it off when Rix fought for the gun. A silver button, Rix thought. He tried to think past the whisper that urged him to kill Raven\u0027s father. A silver button. Where had he seen - His head pounded fiercely, and the voice within him shrieked DO IT NOW! His finger convulsed on the trigger, and at the same time Rix heard his own desperate cry. The Commando fired, gouging wood from the floor six inches from Dunstan\u0027s skull. Rix turned and, with a shout of anger and revulsion, flung the gun through the broken window. He picked up the silver button and ran from the house, through the sheets of rain to his car. At the end of the driveway, he saw that the brown van was gone. He sank his foot to the floor, causing the Thunderbird to fishtail dangerously. His hands gripped the wheel hard, and his shame at being so close to murder brought bitter tears to his eyes. He had almost done something that - for the first time in his life - would have made his father very, very proud.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/usher-s-passing/page-40.html","bookId":2474,"book":{"id":2474,"title":"Usher\u0027s Passing","description":"Storyline: In this most gothic of Robert McCammon\u0027s novels, setting is key: the continuing saga of the Usher family (descended from the brother of Roderick and Madeline of Edgar Poe\u0027s \"Fall of the House of Usher\") takes place in the weird and picturesque heart of the North Carolina mountains.
