{"id":82966,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"RIX ENTERED THE GATEHOUSE LIVING ROOM AND WENT TO THE decanters to pour himself a stiff drink. As he splashed bourbon into a glass, he heard his mother say, \"Where have you been?\"\n He turned toward her voice. She was sitting in her chair before the fireplace, wearing a white gown and a diamond necklace. Rix poured his drink and took a long swallow of it.\n \"Where have you been?\" she asked again. \"Off the estate?\" \"I was driving around.\" \"Driving around where?\" \"Here and there. Who are Dad\u0027s visitors?\" \"General McVair and Mr. Meredith, from the plant. Don\u0027t change the subject. I don\u0027t think I like your sudden disappearances very much.\"\n \"Okay.\" He shrugged, trying to think of an excuse to pacify her. \"I went to Asheville, to see a friend of mine from college. Then I drove by the Lodge.\" His hand was shaking as he lifted the glass to his mouth again. What had happened at the Lodge only a short while ago now seemed as vague and strange as an unsettling, half-remembered dream. He felt jittery and irritable, and all he could see in his mind was that open doorway, and beyond it the magnificence of the Lodge. \"Where\u0027s Katt?\" He\u0027d noted that her pink Maserati was missing from the garage.\n \"She\u0027s driven into Asheville, too. Sometimes she has lunch with friends.\"\n \"So it\u0027s all right for her to leave, but I can\u0027t. Right?\"\n \"I can\u0027t understand your comings and goings,\" she said, watching him carefully. \"You say you drove by the Lodge? Why?\"\n \"Jesus! What is this, an inquisition? Yes, I drove by the Lodge. No special reason. I saw Boone over there, too. He was prowling around inside with a flashlight.\"\n Margaret turned her attention to the small flames that flickered in the hearth. \"He loves the Lodge,\" she told him. \"He\u0027s said so a hundred times. He goes inside to walk the hallways. But I\u0027ve warned him about the Lodge, Rix. I\u0027ve told him . . . not to trust the Lodge too much.\"\n Rix finished his drink and put the glass aside. \"Not to trust it? What do you mean?\"\n \"I meant what I said,\" she replied evenly. \"I\u0027ve warned him that someday . . . someday the Lodge is not going to let him come out again.\"\n \"The Lodge isn\u0027t alive,\" Rix said - but he recalled the imagined aromas and sounds, the faint whisper of his own name like someone beckoning him in, the dark form that had moved near the marble fountain. What would have happened, he wondered, if he had continued into the Lodge? Would that door have swung shut behind him? Would the rooms have lengthened and twisted crazily out of shape, as they had when he was a child?\n She sat for a moment as if she hadn\u0027t heard. Then she said softly, \"I loved the Lodge, too. Walen and I lived there during Erik\u0027s last days. That was a terrible time, but still . . . I thought the Lodge was the most beautiful house on earth. Walen warned me not to go off alone in the Lodge, but I was a stupid, headstrong girl. I decided to explore it by myself. I went from one exquisite room to the next. I followed corridors that seemed to go on for miles. I took stairways that I\u0027d never seen before - and never saw again.\" She looked up from the fire at him. \"I was lost for ten hours, and I\u0027ve never been so frightened in my life. It must have been awful for you, wandering in the dark. If Edwin hadn\u0027t found you . . . God only knows what might\u0027ve happened.\"\n \"It\u0027s a miracle I didn\u0027t break my neck on a staircase,\" Rix said.\n \"Not only that. No . . . not only that.\" She paused, as if trying to decide whether to continue or not. When she spoke again, her voice was pitched very low. \"Erik was always building onto the Lodge. The work stopped not because the job was finished - but because the workmen wouldn\u0027t complete it.\"\n \"Why? Wasn\u0027t he paying them enough?\"\n \"Oh, he was paying them, all right,\" she said. \"Paying them triple wages. But Walen told me they stopped because they Were afraid. One day before Walen and I were married, thirty workmen went into the Lodge. Twenty-eight came back out. The other two . . . well, the other two did not. And never did. I\u0027ve always thought that, somehow, the Lodge would not let them go.\n Rix had never heard his mother talk this way about Usher\u0027s Lodge. It both unnerved and fascinated him. \"Why did you and Dad decide to leave the Lodge after Erik died?\"\n \"Because it\u0027s just too big. And I never got over that feeling of being lost in there, almost. . . as if I were at the Lodge\u0027s mercy. Besides, the Lodge is unsteady. I\u0027ve felt the floors shake under my feet there. At the center of the house, the walls are cracking.\" She was nervously fingering the rings on her hands. \"We didn\u0027t brick in the windows because of the birds, Rix; we bricked them in because they kept shattering. Over the years, every window in the Lodge has exploded outward. What that is, I don\u0027t know. I just know . . . I dreaded thunderstorms when we lived there. Thunderstorms, particularly violent ones, when thunder shook the house, scared me to death. It was during those that most of the windows blew out.\"\n Thunderstorms, Rix thought. He remembered Ludlow\u0027s fear of them from Nora\u0027s diary, and Nora\u0027s perception of the Lodge trembling around her. Erik had said the Lodge was built in an area that was prone to earthquakes. Could severe thunderstorms, Rix wondered, actually be triggering quakes?\n \"I think Boone\u0027s love of the Lodge is a dangerous infatuation,\" Margaret said. \"He\u0027s been after me lately to have the electricity turned on again in there. It wouldn\u0027t surprise me if he actually wanted to move into the Lodge.\" She hesitated, and Rix saw dismay pass over her face. \"I\u0027ve always thought that for some reason the Lodge was meant to attract thunder and lightning, with all those rods and tall spires on the roof. When a storm comes over the mountains, it seems to be drawn right to that house.\" She said it with a hint of revulsion. \"If the thunder is loud enough, it almost shakes the Gatehouse to pieces.\"\n \"There was an earthquake around here in 1892 or 1893, wasn\u0027t there? Didn\u0027t it damage the Lodge?\"\n She looked at him questioningly, as if she wondered where he got his information, but then she said, \"I don\u0027t know, but I wouldn\u0027t be surprised. I was sitting right in this room four years ago, when most of the windows on the north side of the house exploded. One of the servants had to be taken to a hospital. Cass was cut on the arm. And I\u0027ve been in the dining room several times when the plates trembled on the table. So perhaps we do have tremors from time to time - though it\u0027s nothing like living in the Lodge at the height of a thunderstorm.\"\n \"The windows on the north side?\" Rix walked across the room to the north-facing picture window and pulled aside the curtain. He was facing Briartop Mountain and the Lodge. \"I never heard about that.\"\n \"After it happened, we never discussed it among ourselves. Walen said it was a freak thing - something to do with air pressure, or a jet breaking the sound barrier or something. The rain got in and made an awful mess, I remember.\"\n Rix turned toward her. \"Did that happen during a thunderstorm, too?\"\n \"Yes, it did. There was glass all over the rug, and I\u0027m lucky it didn\u0027t put my eyes out when the window blew in.\"\n \"The windows blew inward?\" he asked, and she nodded. Earthquakes, thunderstorms, and the Lodge, he mused - was there a connection between them? She\u0027d said that the Lodge\u0027s windows exploded outward. That seemed to suggest a disturbance in the air, rather than a quake - maybe a Shockwave, he thought. But a Shockwave from what?\n \"I\u0027m going to tell you something I\u0027ve never told a living soul,\" Margaret said. She peered into the fire, avoiding his gaze. \"With all my heart, I despise Usherland.\"\n It was spoken with such conviction that Rix couldn\u0027t reply. All his life, he\u0027d assumed that his mother gloried in the grandeur of Usherland, that she\u0027d rather live nowhere else on earth. \"At first,\" she continued, \"I thought Usherland was the most beautiful place in the world. Perhaps it is. I loved Walen when I married him. I still do. Oh, he\u0027s always been a loner, he doesn\u0027t really need anyone, and I understand that. But before Erik passed his scepter to Walen, your father was a carefree, happy young man. I saw him the afternoon he came down from Erik\u0027s Quiet Room with that cane clenched in his hand. I swear to you, he looked as if he\u0027d aged ten years. He locked himself in his study for three days and nights, and on the fourth morning he came out, because Erik had died in the night.\" She lifted her chin, and her glassy eyes met Rix\u0027s. \"From that time on, Walen was different. He didn\u0027t smile anymore. He turned his entire life into his work.\" She shrugged. \"But I hung on. What else could I do? Having you children gave me something to occupy my time.\"\n \"And you blame Usherland for changing Dad?\"\n \"Before that scepter was passed, your father and I took vacations. We went to Paris, to the French Riviera, to Madrid and Rio de Janeiro. But after Walen became the master of Usherland, he refused to leave it. There was always the business to answer to. Usherland had seized both of us, made us into prisoners. These\" - she motioned wanly at the walls - \"are our gilded bars. The time is coming,\" she said, \"when that scepter will be passed again. I pity the one who accepts it. You others will be free, to lead your lives as you please. I hope both of you live them very far away from Usherland.\" She sighed deeply and without strength, as if released from a great burden. Rix came over to stand beside her. She looked frail and tired, an old woman with a strained, overly made-up face. Rix felt she wouldn\u0027t live very long after Walen\u0027s death. Everything she was, her total identity, was enmeshed in Usherland. Katt would of course insist that she stay here, but Margaret\u0027s life had been lived as a decoration in the house of Walen Usher.\n He felt an overwhelming surge of pity for her. How could it be, he wondered, that one\u0027s own parents were often the most distant strangers? He leaned over to kiss her cheek.\n She shifted uncomfortably, and turned her face away. \"Don\u0027t. You smell like bourbon.\"\n Rix stopped, and straightened up until his back was rigid.\n Their silence was interrupted by a light tapping on the door. \"What is it?\" Rix said curtly.\n The doors slid open. A maid peered tentatively in. \"Mrs. Usher? The gentlemen would like to speak with you, ma\u0027am.\"\n \"Send them in,\" Margaret told her, and Rix saw a transformation come over his mother as suddenly as if a switch had been thrown in her head. She rose from her chair and turned to greet her visitors with the smooth, gliding motion of a practiced hostess, her eyes bright and her smile turned to full incandescence.\n The uniformed man that Margaret had identified as General McVair - heavyset, craggy-featured, with close-cropped gray sideburns and small eyes as powerful as pale blue laser beams - came into the living room. He was followed by Meredith, from the armaments plant. Meredith wore a dark blue vested suit, and had short blond hair flecked with gray. Aviator-style sunglasses obscured his eyes. Handcuffed to his left wrist was a black briefcase. m\n \"\u0027Scuse us, please,\" General McVair said, with a deep-fried Southern accent that sounded, to Rix\u0027s ear, highly exaggerated. \"Miz Usher, I wanted you to know we were on our way. Thank you for your hospitality.\"\n \"You\u0027re ever so welcome, General. I know Walen appreciates your visits.\"\n \"Well, I\u0027m sorry to intrude at a time like this, but I\u0027m afraid business is business.\" His eyes moved from her to Rix.\n \"Oh, pardon me. I don\u0027t think you\u0027ve met our youngest son. Rix, this is General McVair - I\u0027m sorry, but I don\u0027t know your Christian name.\" She fluttered her hands helplessly.\n \"Call me Bert. All my friends do.\" He shook Rix\u0027s hand with a grip that threatened to grind Rix\u0027s knuckles together. Rix squeezed bade just as hard, and a look passed between them like two wary animals sizing each other up. \"I expect you know Mr. Meredith?\"\n \"We\u0027ve never met.\" Meredith\u0027s voice was soft and reserved, and his mouth twisted like a gray worm when he spoke. He didn\u0027t offer his hand.\n McVair seemed to examine Rix\u0027s face right down to the pores on his skin. \"You favor your father,\" he decided. \"Got the same nose and hair. Your dad and I go back a long way. Saved my skin during Korea, when he sold us about ten thousand incendiary devices that were jim-dandies. Of course, anything your dad\u0027s business cooks up is worth its weight in gold.\" He smiled broadly, showing large, even teeth. \"Make that platinum, times bein\u0027 what they are.\"\n Rix nodded toward the briefcase Meredith held. \"Working on something new?\"\n \"The company is, yes,\" Meredith replied.\n \"Mind if I ask what it is?\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry. It\u0027s classified.\"\n Walen\u0027s final project? Rix wondered. Pendulum? He smiled at the general. \"Can\u0027t even give me a hint?\"\n \"Not without you signin\u0027 a lot of papers and goin\u0027 through a big long security check, young fella.\" McVair returned the smile. \"Some folks we\u0027d rather not mention sure would like to get a look at it.\"\n Meredith glanced at his wristwatch. \"General, we\u0027ve got to be getting back to the plant now. Mrs. Usher, it was good seeing you again. A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Usher.\"\n Rix let them get to the door, then he tried a shot in the dark. \"What\u0027s Pendulum going to do for you, General?\"\n Both men stopped as if they\u0027d run into a glass wall. McVair turned, still smiling, though his eyes were cold and wary. Meredith\u0027s face was impassive. \"What say, son?\" McVair asked.\n \"Pendulum,\" Rix replied. \"That\u0027s the name of my father\u0027s last project, isn\u0027t it? I\u0027m curious to know exactly what it is, and how the Pentagon\u0027s going to use it.\" He suddenly realized that he\u0027d seen a face very similar to McVair\u0027s before: the overfed, florid face of the cop who\u0027d called him a \"fuckin\u0027 hippie\" before the baton had cracked down against Rix\u0027s skull. They were the same breed of animal. \"Pendulum,\" he repeated, as McVair stared at him. \"Now that\u0027s a name to conjure with, isn\u0027t it?\" He smiled tightly, his cheek muscles aching. He had a dizzying sensation of being out of control, but he didn\u0027t give a damn. These two men represented everything he detested about being an Usher. \"Let\u0027s see now, what can it be? A nuclear missile that homes in on an infant\u0027s heartbeat? Time-release capsules of plague virus?\"\n \"Rix!\" Margaret hissed, her face contorted.\n \"Nerve gas, that\u0027s it!\" Rix said. \"Or something that melts a person\u0027s bones like jelly. Am I getting warm, General?\"\n McVair\u0027s smile hung by a lip. Meredith urged softly, \"I believe we should go now.\"\n \"Oh, not yet!\" Rix said, determined to push it to the limit. He took two steps forward. \"We\u0027re just beginning to understand each other, aren\u0027t we?\"\n Meredith grasped the general\u0027s arm, but the other man quickly shrugged him off. \"I\u0027ve heard a lot about you, boy,\" McVair said calmly. \"You\u0027re the one who got his noggin busted at that so-called peace rally and had your face spread all over the newspapers. Well, let me tell you something. Your dad is a patriot, and if it wasn\u0027t for men like him, we\u0027d be down on our knees beggin\u0027 the Russians not to lop off our heads! It takes more brains to build military deterrents than it does to go marchin\u0027 in hippie parades! You may have cut your hair, but it must\u0027ve grown clear through your brain!\" He glanced at Margaret. \"I regret this outburst, ma\u0027am. Good afternoon to you.\" He touched the brim of his cap and quickly followed Meredith out of the room.\n Rix started to go after them, ready to continue the argument. Margaret said, \"Don\u0027t you dare!\" and he stopped at the door.\n She came toward him like a thundercloud. \"I hope you\u0027re proud!\" she rasped, her eyes wide. \"Oh, I hope you\u0027re feeling like the king of the world! Have you lost your mind?\"\n \"I was expressing my opinion.\"\n \"God save us from your opinions, then! I thought I taught you good manners!\"\n Rix couldn\u0027t hold back a short, sharp laugh. \"Manners?\" he said incredulously. \"Jesus Christ! Where\u0027s your soul? Is it covered over with white silk and diamond necklaces? That bastard was walking out of here with another killing machine that my father dreamed up!\"\n Margaret said stiffly, \"I think you\u0027d better go to your room, young man.\"\n A strangled scream caught in his throat. Couldn\u0027t she understand? Couldn\u0027t anyone understand but him? No amount of fine clothes or furniture or food or expensive cars could alter the simple, terrible fact that the Ushers fed on death! \"Better still,\" he said, \"I\u0027ll get the hell out of here!\" He whirled away from her and stalked out of the room with her shouts flung at his back.\n Halfway up the stairs, he knew he\u0027d let himself go too far. Pain rippled up the back of his neck and hammered at his temples. Colors and sounds began to sharpen. He staggered, had to stop to grip the banister. It was going to be a bad one, he knew - and where could he hide? His heartbeat was beginning to deafen him. Jagged images tumbled through his mind: his emaciated father, dying in the Quiet Room; the Lodge\u0027s open door, leading into darkness; a shining silver circle with the face of a roaring lion; a skeleton with bloody eyeholes, swinging slowly in a doorway; Boone\u0027s distorted face saying \"Peed your pants, didn\u0027t ya?; Sandra\u0027s hair floating in the bloody water . . .\n His bones ached as if they were being pulled from the sockets. He stumbled up the stairs, heading toward Katt\u0027s Quiet Room. Che skin on his palms sizzled on the banister.\n In Katt\u0027s bedroom, Rix pulled open the closet door. The closet was large, with clothes hung from metal racks and a hundred pairs of shoes on wall shelves. He pushed the clothes away from the rear wall, as the pain increased and his eyes were almost blinded by the frenzy of colors. He felt wildly along the wall, sweat oozing down his face.\n His fingers closed around a small knob, and he turned it frantically, praying that it wouldn\u0027t be locked.\n It came open. Rix squeezed himself into a space as small as a coffin. The walls and floor were covered with thick foam rubber. When Rix pushed the door shut, all sounds - water thundering through pipes, the hiss and moan of the wind outside, the artillery-boom of a ticking clock - were dramatically softened. Still, the noise of his own heartbeat and breathing was inescapable. He moaned, clamped his hands over his ears, and curled into a tight ball on the floor.\n The attack was worsening. Under his clothes, his flesh stung and sweated.\n And, to Rix\u0027s horror, a sliver of light was entering beneath the door. Normal vision would have been unable to see it, but to Rix it pulsated like a white-hot ray of neon. The light\u0027s heat scorched his face; it became the blade of a sword that lengthened across the floor, quickly becoming sharper and brighter.\n Rix turned his face away - and into the fierce red glare of what felt like a heat lamp. The light was reflecting off an object on a shelf just above his head. He put his hand up there - felt earplugs, a velvet mask with an elastic band, and a small metal box. Light was hitting the corner of the box, exploding like a nova. Rix slipped the mask over his eyes and waited, trembling, for the attack to fade or strengthen.\n Over the booming of his heartbeat came a nightmarish, garbled sound that at first he didn\u0027t recognize. It steadily grew louder, and at last he knew what it was, and from where it came.\n The Quiet Room.\n It was his father\u0027s mirthless laughter.\n Rix\u0027s spine bowed under the full weight of the attack, and when he cried out, his head almost blew apart. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/usher-s-passing/page-30.html","bookId":2474,"book":{"id":2474,"title":"Usher\u0027s Passing","description":"Storyline: \n In this most gothic of Robert McCammon\u0027s novels, setting is key: the continuing saga of the Usher family (descended from the brother of Roderick and Madeline of Edgar Poe\u0027s \"Fall of the House of Usher\") takes place in the weird and picturesque heart of the North Carolina mountains.
