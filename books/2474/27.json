{"id":100982,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"Five TIME WILL TELL THE TALE 26 GRAY CLOUDS WERE SCUDDING ACROSS THE SUN AS RAVEN DUNSTAN guided her stuttering Volkswagen up Briartop Mountain. An occasional strong gust of wind parted the trees and hit the car, and the tires slipped on a thick layer of decomposing leaves. She\u0027d found Clint Perry\u0027s house about an hour before, and told the man where she wanted to go. Perry - a lean, hawk-nosed man in overalls - had looked at her as if she were crazy. It was a long haul up there, he\u0027d warned her, and the only road was so bad it had busted the bottom out of his truck when he\u0027d gone up with Sheriff Kemp a couple of months before. Raven insisted that Perry draw her a map, and offered him twenty dollars to go with her, but he said - nervously, it seemed to Raven - that he had better things to do than to go running all over the mountain. She\u0027d already climbed well past the Tharpe house, passing other rundown shacks hidden in shadowy hollows. She came to the crossroads that Perry had indicated on the map, and took the road that branched off to the left. Almost at once the wheels of her car were being battered by potholes. The road reared up so steeply she was sure the car couldn\u0027t make it, but she fought the gears and was rewarded when the grade leveled off. To the left, through breaks in the forest, she could look over the side of Briartop onto Usherland. The chimneys and spires of Usher\u0027s Lodge speared through thin, low-lying clouds. The torture to her car went on for another mile or more, and she cursed her stupidity at coming up here. Then, abruptly, she turned a wooded bend and the road stopped at a group of large boulders. A path snaked between the rocks and vanished into the forest. Following the directions Perry had given her, Raven left her car and walked up the path. It was steep, and her leg was aching before she\u0027d gone thirty yards. Coils of thorns curled from the woods; the vegetation on either side of the path was impenetrable. But then, at the crest of the rise, Raven caught her first glimpse of the ruined town that stood atop the mountain. To call it a town, Raven realized, was a wild exaggeration. Perhaps it had been a small settlement of some kind more than a hundred years ago, but now all that remained were piles of stones, a jutting chimney here and there, and an occasional standing wall. A couple of stone structures were still mostly intact, but only one of those had any semblance of a roof, and the other had gaping holes in its walls. Oddly, the ruins were not overgrown with weeds, thorns, and kudzu vines; though a few straggly bushes had struggled up from the dark, bare earth, the ruins sat at the center of a clearing strewn with rocks. Even the sparse trees that had taken root around the ruins looked dead and petrified, their leafless branches frozen into weird angles. The place appeared desolate, totally deserted for many, many years. Raven was cold; she lifted the collar of her corduroy jacket around her neck. If indeed an old man lived up here, she wondered, how in the world did he survive? Raven followed the path into the ruins. Her boots crunched on the brittle ground; she stopped, bent down, and scooped up a handful of earth. Bits of glass glittered in her palm. She let the earth sift between her fingers, then stood up again. As she walked amid the ruins, Raven saw that most of the crumbling stones resembled lumps of coal. Sometime in the past, a fire of brutal heat had burned here. She moved aside fallen leaves with her foot, and looked down at clumps of glass in the ground. And then she walked around to the far side of a standing wall, and stopped. On the black stones was the pale gray silhouette of a human being, arms splayed as if in impact with the wall. The body was contorted like a question mark. At the figure\u0027s feet was another shape, barely recognizable as a human being, lifting one arm as if in supplication. A nearby jumble of loose stones caught her attention. She bent down carefully, because of the pain in her leg. One of the stones had a rusted nail driven into it. Another showed the outline of a hand and wrist. Raven ran her fingers over the stone. She was reminded of pictures she\u0027d seen in a book about Hiroshima. In those photos, outlines of the atomic bomb victims were left burned into walls - just as these figures were. Whatever had happened here, Raven thought uneasily, the results - the silhouettes, the black stones, the ground burned to clumps of glass - were uncannily similar. Raven rose to her feet. What kind of destruction had left its mark here? And when? Why was this town built on top of the mountain? Who were its inhabitants? She was pondering those questions when she turned away from the rubble and found the old man standing about ten feet away, next to the scorched wall. He was leaning on his twisted cane, his head cocked so that he could see through his good eye. His ragged clothes were filthy, and the wind buffeted the long dark coat he wore. \"Find somethin\u0027 of interest?\" he asked, his hard gaze drilling through her. It was the same old man that Raven had almost hit on the road. \"I . . . didn\u0027t know you were there.\" He grunted. \"Watched you look at that wall. Watched you bend over them stones. I been right here.\" Impossible, Raven thought. If so, why hadn\u0027t she seen him when she\u0027d walked around the wall in the first place? \"Who are you?\" he asked. \"What do you want here?\" \"My name\u0027s Raven Dunstan. I own the Foxton Democrat.\u0027\u0027 There was no recognition in that single staring eye. \"The newspaper down in Foxton,\" she explained. \"I\u0027ve come up to find you.\" \"You\u0027ve found me, then.\" He glanced in the direction from which she\u0027d come. \"You climb up the mountain in that little yaller car? Wind\u0027ll pick that thing up and toss it clear down to Usherland.\" Again, Raven was puzzled. The car wasn\u0027t visible from here. How did he know it was yellow? \"The road\u0027s not too good, but I made it. Do you live alone here?\" \"Alone,\" he replied. \"And not alone. What\u0027s troublin\u0027 your leg?\" \"I . . . hurt it, a long time ago. In an accident.\" \"You were a little girl,\" he said, stating a fact, and touched her knee tentatively with his cane. \"Yes.\" She stepped away from him. A sharp spasm of pain pierced her knee. He nodded, hawked, and spat phlegm on the ground. When he breathed deeply again, Raven could hear the rumble of fluids in his lungs. His complexion was a chalky yellow. She stared at the network of scars that covered almost all of his face; the right eye was gone. The left eye, though covered with a thin gray film, was pale green and held a gleam of crafty intelligence. He was very thin, shivering a bit in the cold, and she had no idea how old he was; he could be anywhere from seventy to a hundred. One thing she was certain of: he was sick. \"Chilly out here in the open,\" the Mountain King said, and nodded toward the sky. \"Weather\u0027s changin\u0027. Clouds creepin\u0027 in before the wind. Be a storm directly.\" He lifted his cane off the ground with a trembling hand and pointed toward the shelter that still had the remnants of a roof. \"That\u0027s my house. It\u0027ll be warmer inside there.\" Without waiting for her, he turned away and started toward it, picking his path with the cane. Raven was appalled by the old man\u0027s living conditions, but the walls did block the wind. There were a few charred pieces of wood in the cold fireplace. Empty cans littered the floor. A mattress on the floor was covered with a tattered orange blanket, and newspapers poked out from underneath it. The place, to Raven\u0027s way of thinking, was thoroughly disgusting. The Mountain King eased himself down to sit on the mattress. Raven heard his bones creak. He had a fit of coughing that went on for a minute or so, then he spat in an empty peach can beside the bed. His face crinkled distastefully. \"I can\u0027t pee,\" he said in a wounded tone. \"I wish I could, but I can\u0027t.\" \"There\u0027s a doctor at the clinic in Foxton who might be able to help you.\" \"A doctor?\" the old man snapped. He snorted and spat into the can again. \"Doctors are licensed killers. They put pills and needles in you. I won\u0027t go to Foxton. Too many people. I\u0027ll stay where I am.\" \"How long have you been sick?\" \"Since the comets fell,\" he answered. \"I don\u0027t never recall not bein\u0027 sick. It comes and goes. Still cold in here, ain\u0027t it?\" He cocked his good eye toward the fireplace. Raven felt the rush of heat at her back before she heard the sudden whoosh! of flame. Startled, she whirled toward the fireplace. The logs were burning. The old man hadn\u0027t touched them, but they were afire. \"How . . . did you do that?\" she asked. \"Do what?\" \"The fire. How did you . . . light the fire?\" \"Hush!\" The Mountain King grasped his cane and stood up. It took him a little while longer to straighten his back, and he hissed with pain. Cans and bottles rolled around his feet as he hobbled to the door and peered out. \"Somebody\u0027s comin\u0027,\" he announced. \"Two people. Woman and man. No. Woman and boy. Comin\u0027 up the road. Boy\u0027s drivin\u0027. It\u0027s him.\" He paused, his cane thrust out before him like an antenna. \"Yep,\" he said. \"It\u0027s him, all right.\" Raven was still staring at the burning logs; her senses were spinning, and she\u0027d barely heard what the old man had said. She held her hands out toward the heat to test its reality. \"The woman sees that yaller car,\" the old man muttered. \"She knows it. She wants to go back down the mountain.\" He glanced quickly at Raven. \"She don\u0027t like you worth a tinker\u0027s damn.\" \"Who?\" Raven rubbed the side of her head with numbed fingers. \"Mrs. Tharpe?\" \"Yep. She\u0027s scairt of you.\" He paused, then grunted with satisfaction. \"The boy\u0027s got more sense. They\u0027re comin\u0027 up the trail.\" The Mountain King hobbled out to meet them. Left alone, Raven backed away from the fireplace. She felt oddly off balance, trespassing in an alien world that did not conform to her laws of reality. The old man hadn\u0027t touched those logs . . . yet they\u0027d burst into flame; he\u0027d known someone was coming from a distance of a hundred yards or more; he\u0027d even verified that Myra Tharpe feared her. What kind of man was he, and why did he choose to live alone in these ruins? Raven looked around the disordered house. Buckets had been placed under holes in the roof to catch leaks. Dead leaves, bottles, and cans were scattered everywhere. Her gaze came to rest on the mattress, and slowly she came to realize something that she hadn\u0027t before. Beneath the orange blanket was the vague outline of a body. Raven stared at it without moving. Then, slowly, she approached the mattress and pulled the blanket back. Underneath was a hodgepodge of rags, newspaper and magazine pages. A damp, moldy smell drifted up. The figure was more apparent now, buried beneath the rags and papers. Raven allowed her hand to knock one of the rags to the floor. There were more papers beneath. She grasped the edge of a yellowed newspaper page and carefully lifted it. She found herself looking at a frail, skeletal hand and arm. The displacement of another clump of rags revealed part of a small ribcage. The Mountain King, Raven realized as she stepped quickly away from the mattress, was sleeping with a skeleton in his bed. The fire spat sparks. Raven looked over her shoulder and saw the old man standing just inside the doorway. How long he\u0027d been there she didn\u0027t know, but he seemed uninterested in her now; he crossed the room to warm himself before the flames, and coughed several times to loosen the congestion in his lungs. In another moment, New Tharpe came into the house; he was bundled in a sweater and brown jacket, his face very pale except for the faint red lines where the thorn scratches were healing. He carried a paper sack. Myra Tharpe stopped in the doorway, her mouth twisting bitterly. \"Well now,\" she said, \"looky here. I seen that car of yours down there. If New hadn\u0027t talked me into stayin\u0027, we\u0027d be long gone by now. Seems you turn up like a bad penny, don\u0027t you?\" \"I do my best.\" Myra entered the house, her nose wrinkling. She stood near the door, her back protected by a wall. Her small, frightened eyes darted between Raven and the Mountain King. \"Give him what we brung, New.\" New offered him the sack. The old man took it tentatively, looked inside, and then carried it over to a corner where he dumped the contents on the floor. More canned food rattled out. \"Didn\u0027t have no peaches,\" Myra said nervously as he picked through the cans. \"Brung you some mixed fruit, though. And a couple cans of beef stew.\" The Mountain King had selected the mixed fruit. He shook it and held it to his ear. \"It\u0027s fresh,\" Myra assured him. \"Bought it just a few days ago, down at the market in Foxton.\" He grunted, obviously satisfied. His eye was fixed on the boy. \"New. Is that your name?\" \"Yes sir. Newlan Tharpe.\" New was trembling inside, but he was determined not to show it. When he and his mother were walking up the path, the Mountain King had suddenly appeared behind them. Then, without a word, he\u0027d led them up through the ruins to this desolate old place. New\u0027s mother had raised hell when she\u0027d recognized Raven Dunstan\u0027s car, but New had soothed her; since they\u0027d come up this far, they might as well go on. What did it matter that the newspaperwoman was up in the ruins too? Myra had said it mattered a lot, but the appearance of the Mountain King had stopped further argument. \"How old are you?\" \"Fifteen, sir.\" \"You know how old I am?\" the old man asked, with a trace of pride. \"I was born in . . . let me think . . . I was born in nineteen-ought-nine. When I was fifteen, I . . .\" His voice trailed off. Then he said, \"I was right here. That was after the comets fell. I\u0027m not clear in the head no more. But I recall the year I was fifteen, because that was the year Lizbeth turned eleven . . . and he almost snatched her.\" \"Lizbeth?\" Raven glanced toward the mattress. \"My sister. It was her and me, after the comets fell. We come up here together. That was in . . .\" He frowned, trying to remember, and then shook his head. \"A long time past.\" \"Who almost snatched her?\" New asked. \"The Pumpkin Man?\" \"New!\" his mother warned. \"Him,\" the old man said. \"The Pumpkin Man. The Briartop Stalker. The Child Snatcher. Whatever you want to call him. I know him for what he really is: an agent of the Devil himself. Lizbeth and me set us some traps for rabbits. She went out near dusk to see what we\u0027d caught. She come out through the woods and seen him, standin\u0027 so close she could\u0027ve touched him. He grabbed at her, and she took to runnin\u0027. She could hear him right behind her, gettin\u0027 closer and closer; she said he could run like the wind, and not thorns nor vines nor nothin\u0027 slowed him down. Lizbeth run so fast she couldn\u0027t hardly get no breath. And all the time he was callin\u0027 for her to stop, to lay down and rest because she was tired, and there wasn\u0027t no use in tryin\u0027 to get away.\" \"He spoke to her?\" Raven asked. The old man tapped the side of his head. \"In here. She heard him in here. She said his voice was like a cool stream on a hot day, and he made you want to lay down and rest. But she knew who he was, and that he was tryin\u0027 to trick her. So she didn\u0027t listen; every time she wanted to stop runnin\u0027, she thought of that sound the comets made when they was comin\u0027 down, and that kept her goin\u0027. She didn\u0027t stop till she\u0027d come back here, and she never went out without me again.\" \"Lizbeth saw his face? What did he look like?\" \"His face . . . changed.\" The old man had placed one finger atop the can of mixed fruit, pressing here and there as if he were trying to poke through the tin. \"First he had a face, and then he didn\u0027t. Lizbeth said she seen the white of his skin . . . and then his face was gone. There was nothin\u0027 but a hole where his face should\u0027ve been.\" He turned his attention to the boy again, tilting his head to one side. \"You\u0027ve seen him, too. Ain\u0027t you?\" \"Yes,\" New replied. \"And his black cat, Greediguts. He come a-callin\u0027 last night, didn\u0027t he?\" \"Yes.\" New felt as helpless as a lock under a key; he could sense the Mountain King picking and probing at him, gradually springing him open. \"Your ma\u0027s afraid,\" the Mountain King said softly. \"Powerful afraid. There\u0027s been a fear in her heart for a long time. It makes her near \u0027bout blind. But you - you\u0027re just beginnin\u0027 to see clear, ain\u0027t you? \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Tharpe,\" the old man whispered. His breathing was a low tumble of congestion. \"Tharpe. The man who lived in that house was your pa?\" New nodded. \"And what was his name?\" \"Bobby,\" Myra offered. \"Bobby Tharpe. I seen him, comin\u0027 and goin\u0027. Sometimes I stood all night in the woods across the road from your house, just watchin\u0027. I followed him to the Tongue, and saw him look down on Usherland. I knew what was in his mind, callin\u0027 and tauntin\u0027 him. I followed him many a time when he left his house and walked the woods. Oh, he never saw me - but I was there, all the same. Once he went down from Briartop to that Lodge, and he stood on the shore and he wanted to go inside so bad he could hardly stand it; but he resisted. I helped him resist, \u0027cause I knew he couldn\u0027t do it alone. Just like you couldn\u0027t get out of them thorns alone, boy. Nor could you hold back Greediguts alone.\" \"What?\" New whispered. \"I don\u0027t know nothin\u0027 about you,\" the Mountain King continued, \"just like I didn\u0027t know nothin\u0027 about your pa. But I do know the Lodge wanted him; and I know it wants you, as well. I seen you on the Tongue, too. I seen the way you stared down at that house, a-wantin\u0027 to walk its halls and run your fingers over that fine marble. Greediguts didn\u0027t come to kill you last night; it came to test you, to find out if you\u0027re stone or paper. Before your pa died, he was weakenin\u0027. You ought to give thanks he is dead - \u0027cause he was about to go into that Lodge, and what he would\u0027ve come back out as . . . you wouldn\u0027t want to know.\" Raven shook her head, utterly confused. To her, the old man was speaking gibberish. Was he insane, or was she? \"No one lives in Usher\u0027s Lodge,\" she said. \"It\u0027s empty.\" \"I didn\u0027t say no person lived in there, woman!\" the Mountain King told her scornfully. His gaze flicked toward her like a whip, then back to the boy. \"Ain\u0027t no person wanted your pa. Ain\u0027t no person wants you. That Lodge is more than halls and fine marble, boy. It\u0027s got a black heart, and a voice like a knife in the night. I know - \u0027cause it\u0027s been workin\u0027 at me ever since the comets fell. Chidin\u0027, a-tauntin\u0027 and callin\u0027 me, slippin\u0027 through my dreams, tryin\u0027 to strangle me. Just like it did to your pa, and like it\u0027s doin\u0027 to you. Only I\u0027m an old man, and pert\u0027 soon Greediguts is gonna slip up to my house and I\u0027ll be too weak to hold it off. That\u0027ll be the end of me; but the Lodge wants you now. Like it wanted your pa.\" The old man gripped his walking stick tightly. His eye was unflinching. \"He was about to give in, boy. The stones he\u0027d built in his soul were comin\u0027 apart at the seams. That\u0027s why . . . I had to make sure he couldn\u0027t listen no more.\" Myra sucked in her breath. New hadn\u0027t moved, but now his heart was pounding. \"I killed him, boy,\" the Mountain King said quietly. \"Surely as if I\u0027d put a gun to his head and blowed his brains out. He come upon me on his way down the mountain, the day it happened. I knew the kind of work he did. He was weak, so it didn\u0027t take much; all he had to do was fill up a tire with air - and keep fillin\u0027 it till it blew up in his face. He never even knowed what he was doin\u0027.\" New was silent; all the blood had rushed from his face, and blue veins throbbed at his temple. It was Myra who spoke first, in an incredulous, hoarse voice: \"You . . . you ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 but a crazy old man!\" She came up behind her son. \"You didn\u0027t even know my Bobby! Ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 special about you! You\u0027re just a crazy old liar!\" \"Look at me, boy,\" the Mountain King commanded. He thrust his cane out and rested it beneath New\u0027s chin. \"You know if I\u0027m lyin\u0027 or not, don\u0027t you?\" New brushed the cane aside. He looked helplessly at Raven, and started to speak, but then his voice cracked and he stood there dumbfounded, his sallow face mirroring the battle of emotions within him. He forced himself to return the old man\u0027s gelid stare. \"You\u0027re . . . a crazy old man,\" New said, with an obvious effort. \"Ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 to you a-tall!\" Abruptly he turned and left the house; Myra shot a poisonous glance at Raven and hurried after her son. The Mountain King sighed deeply. His lungs rattled, and he fended off a fit of coughing. \"He knows,\" he said when he\u0027d recovered his breath. \"He didn\u0027t want to say it before his ma, but he knows.\" And you\u0027re as nutty as a Christmas fruitcake, Raven thought. The shape of the skeleton under those rags and papers sent a shiver up her spine. She\u0027d assumed it was the old man\u0027s sister - but what if it wasn\u0027t? What if it was the skeleton of one of those children whose pictures were on the posters she\u0027d had printed up? \"When did your sister die?\" she asked. \"I don\u0027t know the year,\" he said wearily, and rubbed his good eye. \"She was twenty years old . . . or twenty-two. I can\u0027t recall. You seen her bones.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you bury her?\" \"Didn\u0027t want nothin\u0027 gettin\u0027 to her. Swore I\u0027d protect her, and that\u0027s what I did.\" He hobbled over to the bed, lifted the tattered blanket, and reached under a mass of rags. \"Didn\u0027t want the thing that killed her to chew her bones.\" He withdrew a small skull that had been all but crushed; the lower jaw was missing, the nasal area smashed in. \"The pant\u0027er did this. Caught her in broad daylight, at the stream.\" Gently he set the skull down again and picked up the can of mixed fruit he\u0027d set aside. \"The boy knows,\" he muttered. \"He knows.\" \"Knows what?\" The Mountain King stared at her, and smiled thinly. \"That he\u0027s like me,\" he said, thrusting his forefinger through the top of the can as if it were wet cardboard. He withdrew the finger and licked fruit syrup off. Raven had had enough. She fled the house. Behind her she could hear the old man laughing; his laughter erupted into spasmodic coughing. She ran past the figures on the wall, over the ground that had been scorched to glass, and she never looked back. When she reached her car, she received a new shock. The Volkswagen now faced downhill. Something had picked up the car and turned it around. She slid quickly under the steering wheel and started the car. She was almost halfway down Briartop when she realized she\u0027d run through the ruins. Her limp was gone.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/usher-s-passing/page-27.html","bookId":2474,"book":{"id":2474,"title":"Usher\u0027s Passing","description":"Storyline: In this most gothic of Robert McCammon\u0027s novels, setting is key: the continuing saga of the Usher family (descended from the brother of Roderick and Madeline of Edgar Poe\u0027s \"Fall of the House of Usher\") takes place in the weird and picturesque heart of the North Carolina mountains.
