{"id":82941,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"A UNIFORMED NURSE WITH A SURGICAL MASK OVER THE LOWER HALF of her face peered from the Quiet Room at Rix. She wore skintight surgical gloves as well. Above the mask her eyes were dark brown and set in webs of wrinkles.\\n\\n A wave of decay rolled out of the Quiet Room and struck Rix with almost tangible force. He gripped the banister tightly, his teeth clenched.\\n\\n Mrs. Reynolds whispered, \"A mask should help,\" and motioned toward the box.\\n\\n He put one on. The inside was scented with mint, but it was not much help.\\n\\n \"Are you Rix?\" She was a big-boned woman, possibly in her mid-forties, with curly iron-gray hair cut short. Rix noted that her eyes were faintly bloodshot.\\n\\n \"Of course it\u0027s Rix, you damned fool!\" came the hoarse, barely human rasp from the darkness. Rix stiffened. His father\u0027s melodic voice had degenerated to an animal\u0027s growl. \"I told you it would be Rix, didn\u0027t I? Let him in!\"\\n\\n Mrs. Reynolds opened the door wider for him. \"Quickly,\" she said. \"Too much light hurts his eyes. And remember, please keep your voice as soft as possible.\"\\n\\n Rix stepped into the high-ceilinged, rubber-walled room. Then were no windows. The only light came from a small green shaded Tensor lamp on a table next to the chair where Mrs Reynolds had been sitting. It cast a low-wattage circle of illumination that extended for only a foot or so into the room. He had an instant to see his father\u0027s grim bedroom furniture arranged in the room before Mrs. Reynolds closed the heavy rubber-lined door, sealing off the corridor\u0027s light.\\n\\n He\u0027d seen his father\u0027s canopied bed. There had been something lying in that bed, within a clear plastic oxygen tent. Rix thanked God the door had closed before he\u0027d been able to see it too well.\\n\\n In the darkness he could hear the soft chirping of an oscilloscope.\\n\\n The machine was just to the left of his father\u0027s bed; he saw the pale green zigzag of Walen Usher\u0027s labored heartbeat. His father\u0027s breathing was a pained, liquid gasping. Silk sheets rustled on the bed.\\n\\n \"Do you need anything, Mr. Usher?\" the nurse whispered.\\n\\n \"No,\" the agonized voice replied. \"Don\u0027t shout, goddamn it!\"\\n\\n Mrs. Reynolds returned to her chair, leaving Rix to fend for himself. She continued where she\u0027d left off in her Barbara Cartland novel.\\n\\n \"Come closer,\" Walen Usher commanded.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t see where I\u0027m - \"\\n\\n There was a sharp inhalation. \"Softly! Oh God, my ears . . .\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Rix whispered, unnerved.\\n\\n The oscilloscope had started chirping faster. Walen didn\u0027t speak again until his,heartbeat had slowed down. \"Closer. You\u0027re about to stumble into a chair. Step to your left. Don\u0027t trip over that cable, you idiot! More to the left. All right, you\u0027re five paces from the foot of the bed. Damn it, boy, do you have to stomp?\"\\n\\n When Rix reached the bed, he could feel the fever radiating from his father\u0027s body. He gripped one of the canopy sheets and felt sweat trickling down under his arms.\\n\\n \"Well, well,\" Walen said. Rix could sense himself being examined. The silk sheets rustled again, and a form slowly shifted on the bed. \"So you\u0027ve come home, have you? Turn around. Let me look at you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not a prize horse,\" Rix mumbled to himself under his breath.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not a prize son, either. You don\u0027t fill out those clothes, Rix. What\u0027s wrong with you? Doesn\u0027t writing put enough food on your table?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m all right.\"\\n\\n Walen grunted. \"Like hell you are.\" He was silent, and Rix heard the gurgling of fluid in his lungs. \"I\u0027m sure you recall this room, don\u0027t you? It used to shelter you, Boone, and Kattrina whenever you had attacks. Where do you go now?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a closet I use in my apartment. I\u0027ve got egg cartons stapled to the walls to muffle sound, and I\u0027ve fixed the door so light can\u0027t get in.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll bet you\u0027ve got it looking like a womb. Something about you always craved a return to the womb.\"\\n\\n Rix let the remark go. The darkness and smell of corruption pressed on him. The sickening heat from his father\u0027s body glared in his face like sunlight off metal. \"Where do Katt and Boone go, now that you\u0027ve moved in up here?\"\\n\\n \"Boone\u0027s built his own Quiet Room, a chamber next to his bedroom. Katt\u0027s cut a hole in the wall behind her closet. They don\u0027t have many attacks. They don\u0027t understand what I\u0027m going through in here, Rix. They\u0027ve always lived at Usherland, where it\u0027s safe. But you - you understand what hell can be like, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have that many attacks.\"\\n\\n \"No? What would you call that experience you endured yesterday in New York?\"\\n\\n \"Boone told you?\"\\n\\n \"I heard him telling Margaret, down in the living room last night. You forget how much I can hear, Rix. I heard you talking downstairs with them. I heard you climbing the stairs. I can hear your heartbeat right now. It\u0027s racing. Sometimes my senses are more acute than at other times; it comes in waves. But you understand what I mean, don\u0027t you? Ushers can\u0027t survive for very long beyond the gates of Usherland; it\u0027s a fact I\u0027m sure you\u0027re beginning to appreciate.\"\\n\\n Rix\u0027s eyes were getting used to the darkness. Lying on the bed before him, beneath the folds of the oxygen tent, was something that looked like a brown stick-figure, horribly emaciated. It lay motionless - but when one bony, shriveled arm reached out to draw the silk sheet closer, a shiver rippled up Rix\u0027s spine. A little more than a year ago, Walen Usher had stood over six feet and weighed one hundred eighty-five pounds. The shape on the bed couldn\u0027t possibly weigh more than half that.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t stare at me,\" Walen rasped. \"Your time\u0027ll come.\"\\n\\n A knot clogged Rix\u0027s throat. When he could find his voice, he said, \"It doesn\u0027t appear that living at Usherland all your life has made a difference for you, one way or the other.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re wrong. I\u0027m sixty-four years old. My time is almost up. Look at yourself! You could be my brother instead of my son. Every year you live outside the gates of Usherland, your health will continue to erode. Your attacks will get worse. Soon that little womb won\u0027t be enough. You\u0027ll try to hide in there one day, and you\u0027ll realize too late you\u0027ve overlooked a chink of light. You\u0027ll go blind and mad in there, with no one to help you. Before this\" - his voice dripped with disgust - \"I hadn\u0027t suffered an attack for five years. Hudson Usher knew that the air, here, the peace and solitude, would be a balm to the Malady. He built this estate so his ancestors could live long, full lives. We have our own world here. You\u0027re insane to want to live anywhere else - or you\u0027re intent on committing slow suicide.\"\\n\\n \"I left because I wanted to make my own way.\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\" There was a liquid rush and gurgle from beneath the bed. Bodily waste, Rix realized. Walen was hooked up to tubes that carried his fluids away. \"Yes, you\u0027ve certainly \u0027made your way.\u0027 You wrote advertising copy in some Atlanta department store for a while. Then you took a job selling books And after that you were a copy editor on some local tabloid. Magnificent occupations, one and all. And let\u0027s not forget the. progress of your personal life. Shall we discuss your misbegotten marriage and its aftermath?\"\\n\\n Rix\u0027s jaw clenched. He felt as if he were a child again, and being whipped by the Peacemaker.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll spare you that, then. Let\u0027s talk about your literary achievements.\\n\\n Three pieces of jibbering nonsense. I understand that last book of yours was on the best-seller lists for a short time. As they say, if you put a monkey in a room with a typewriter long enough, he\u0027ll eventually produce Shakespearean sonnets.\" He paused, letting the pain of the lashings sink in. As a child, Rix had fought against crying when the Peacemaker was in use, but the pain ultimately won. Had enough? Walen would ask, and when Rix remained stubbornly silent the belt would whistle again. Walen said offhandedly, \"Those books of yours probably drove your wife to suicide, you know.\"\\n\\n Rix felt his control snap like a splintering bone. His mouth twisted under the mask, and the blood roared in his ears. \"How does it feel to be dying, Dad?\" he heard himself ask in an acid voice. \"You\u0027re about to lose everything, aren\u0027t you? The estate, the business, the Lodge, the money. None of it will be worth a damn when you\u0027re dust in a box, will it?\" The oscilloscope had begun singing, and across the room Mrs. Reynolds nervously cleared her throat. Rix went on, \"You\u0027re going to be dead soon, and no one\u0027s going to care - except maybe those bloodsuckers in the Pentagon. You deserve each other. God knows, the Usher name makes me sick to my stomach!\"\\n\\n The skeleton on the bed hadn\u0027t moved. Suddenly, Walen lifted his skinny arms and softly clapped his hands together twice. \"Very dramatic,\" he whispered. \"Very heartfelt. But don\u0027t you worry about my dying, Rix. I\u0027ll let go when I choose, not before. Until then, I\u0027ll be right here.\"\\n\\n \"I just can\u0027t seem to learn that things never change here, can I? I think I\u0027ve stayed for too long already.\" He started to move away from the bed.\\n\\n \"No. Wait.\" It was a command, and in spite of his anger, Rix obeyed. \"There\u0027s something more I have to say.\"\\n\\n \"Say it, then. I\u0027m leaving.\"\\n\\n \"As you please. But you\u0027ve misjudged me, son. I\u0027ve always had your best interests at heart.\"\\n\\n Rix almost laughed. \"What?\" he asked incredulously.\\n\\n \"I am a human being, no matter what you think. I have feelings. I\u0027ve made mistakes. But I\u0027ve also understood my destiny, Rix, and I\u0027ve prepared for it. Only . . . it\u0027s come upon me so fast, so fast.\" He paused as more fluids rushed through the tubes. \"The indignity of death is the worst of it,\" he said softly. \"I watched my father die like this. I knew what was ahead for me, as well as for my children. You can\u0027t turn your back on your Usher heritage, no matter how hard you try.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to do my best.\"\\n\\n \"Are you? Really?\" Walen\u0027s hand came out from under the sheet and moved to a small panel beside the bed. He began pressing buttons, and a series of television screens lit up on a console that had been built into the wall. The screens\u0027 contrast and brightness had been turned very low, so as not to hurt Walen\u0027s eyes, but Rix could make out the interior of the estate\u0027s Roman-styled natatorium, the indoor tennis courts, the helipad and the helicopter hangar behind the Gatehouse, the interior of the garage with its collection of antique automobiles, and a view of Usherland\u0027s front gates. The closed-circuit cameras panned slowly back and forth. \"The Usher life doesn\u0027t have to be unpleasant,\" Walen said. \"Look what we have here. Our own world. The freedom to do as we please, when we please. And we have influence, Rix - influence you\u0027ve never even dreamt of.\"\\n\\n \"Do you mean the power to blow whole countries off the map?\" Rix asked sharply. In the increased illumination he saw the smiling skull of his father\u0027s face from the corner of his eye. He dared not look too closely.\\n\\n \"Come now. Ushers only design and build the weapons. We don\u0027t aim them. It\u0027s nothing that Colt didn\u0027t do, or Winchester, or a hundred other men with vision. We\u0027ve just taken the process a few steps further.\"\\n\\n \"From flintlock muskets to laser guns. What\u0027s next? A weapon to murder babies in their mothers\u0027 wombs? Something to kill them before they grow up to be enemy soldiers?\"\\n\\n The skull grinned. \"You see? I always knew you were the most creative of my children.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll stick to writing.\"\\n\\n The television screens began to go dark. \"Your mother needs you,\" Walen said.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s got Boone and Katt.\"\\n\\n \"Boone has other concerns. That wife of his has made him unstable. And Katt may pretend to be tough, but her emotions are like crystal. Your mother needs a shoulder to lean on right now. Jesus Christ! What\u0027s that hissing noise I keep hearing? It sounds as if it\u0027s coming from somewhere downstairs!\"\\n\\n \"Mother\u0027s spraying Lysol.\" Rix was amazed that his father could detect the distant noise.\\n\\n \"It aggravates the piss out of me! Tell her to stop it. She needs you, Rix. Not Boone or Katt. You.\"\\n\\n \"What about Cass and Edwin?\"\\n\\n \"They have the estate to look after. Damn it, boy! I won\u0027t beg you! This is the last thing I\u0027ll ever ask of you! Stay here, for your mother\u0027s sake!\"\\n\\n Rix had been caught off guard; he hadn\u0027t expected such an open appeal from his father. But here he was, back at Usherland, with the run of the estate and time on his hands - what better opportunity, then, to pursue the idea that had sparked in his mind in New York? The Gatehouse had a large library; there might be something of use in there. He would have to be careful. Though he\u0027d mentioned his idea casually to Cass the last time he\u0027d been home, he didn\u0027t want anyone knowing he was seriously considering it.\\n\\n \"All right,\" Rix agreed. \"Only a few days. I can\u0027t stay any longer.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all I ask.\"\\n\\n Rix nodded. The skeleton on the bed shifted painfully. There was something on the bed beside him. Rix stared at it for a moment before he realized it was the Usher cane with the silver lion\u0027s head, the symbol of the Usher patriarch. Walen\u0027s crablike hand closed around it.\\n\\n \"You can go now,\" Walen told him shortly.\\n\\n My appointment\u0027s over, Rix thought. He turned abruptly away from the bed and groped to the door. Mrs. Reynolds put aside her book and rose to let him out.\\n\\n The muted stairway light stung his eyes. He ripped the surgical mask from his face and dropped it into a stainless-steel trashcan. His clothes reeked of rot.\\n\\n He descended the stairs on shaky legs, but halfway down an overwhelming dizziness struck him. He had to stop as the world spun around. There were cold specks of sweat on his face, and he braced for an attack. But then it passed, and he took several deep breaths to clear his head.\\n\\n When he was ready to walk again, he went along the corridor and found Edwin waiting for him. Edwin didn\u0027t have to ask about his reaction to seeing Walen; Rix\u0027s face looked like a sheet of waxed paper.\\n\\n Edwin cleared his throat. \"Have you seen your room yet?\"\\n\\n \"No. Why?\" The last time he\u0027d slept in there, it was comfortable but nothing special. All his old furniture had long since been taken out to make way for an elaborate bed, a chest of drawers, a rosewood dresser, and a marble-topped table brought from the Lodge.\\n\\n Edwin opened the door for him.\\n\\n Rix stopped as if he\u0027d walked into a glass wall.\\n\\n The room had been changed back again. The ostentatious furniture had departed. In its place was a familiar, battered pinewood desk topped with a green blotter and a beat-up Royal typewriter - his first typewriter, the one he\u0027d pounded out monster stories on when he was ten years old; his own chest of drawers, decorated with a hundred decals from airplane model kits; his bed, with the carved headboard that he\u0027d pretended was a spaceship\u0027s instrument panel; even the dark green rug that looked like forest moss. It was all the same, right down to the brass lamps on the desk and bedside table. Rix was amazed. He had the eerie sensation of stepping backward in time, and thought that if he opened the closet door he might find Boone - a smaller Boone, but no less tricky - crouched in there among the boy-sized suits and shoes, waiting to leap out and scream \"Pumpkin Man!\" at the top of his lungs.\\n\\n \"My God,\" Rix said.\\n\\n \"Your mother insisted that all these items be taken out of storage in the Lodge and returned,\" Edwin said with a helpless shrug.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t believe this! It\u0027s exactly the way the room looked when I was ten years old!\"\\n\\n \"She wanted to make sure you were comfortable. It was all done overnight.\"\\n\\n Rix entered the room. Everything was the same. Even the blue and green checked bedspread. \"How did she remember what was in here? I didn\u0027t think she ever paid that much attention to my room.\"\\n\\n \"Cass and I helped her.\"\\n\\n Rix opened the bottom drawer of the chest, half hoping to find the three stacks of vintage Batman comics he\u0027d saved and then, stupidly, thrown away when he thought he\u0027d outgrown them. The drawer was empty, as were all the others. The smell of mothballs wafted out. Atop the chest was something Rix had all but forgotten - a small carved wooden box. Rix opened it and felt like a kid again; inside was an assortment of polished stones, marbles, and old coins. His collection had remained intact over the years. He gently closed the lid of what he\u0027d called his \"treasure box\" and went to the closet. His garment bag and suitcase were inside.\\n\\n \"Is it all right? Your mother wants to know.\"\\n\\n \"I guess it\u0027s fine. I still can\u0027t believe this! She went a little overboard, didn\u0027t she?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s her way of showing you how pleased she is that you\u0027re back,\" Edwin said. \"And I am too, Rix. Cass and I have missed you more than you\u0027ll ever know.\" He touched Rix\u0027s shoulder gently.\\n\\n \"Is Cass in the kitchen? I\u0027d like to see her.\"\\n\\n \"No, she drove over to the farmer\u0027s market in Foxton for some fresh vegetables. She\u0027s making a Welsh pie for you tonight. Uh . . . you did bring a coat and tie, didn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n Rix smiled thinly. \"I knew that if I didn\u0027t I wouldn\u0027t be allowed to eat.\" His mother barred from the dining room anyone who wasn\u0027t wearing what she considered civilized clothing. \"She\u0027ll never change, will she?\"\\n\\n \"Your mother was brought up to be a lady,\" Edwin said diplomatically. \"She has certain standards. But please, Rix - remember that she\u0027s under a terrible strain right now.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be on my best behavior,\" Rix promised.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll talk later, then. I want to hear about your newest book. What\u0027s its title? Bedlam?\"\\n\\n \"Right.\" He had explained the plot of Bedlam to Edwin one night during a long telephone call about six months before, and he remembered Edwin\u0027s silence when he had gone into detail about the carved-up bodies hanging in the apartment building\u0027s basement. Edwin did his best to be enthusiastic about Rix\u0027s writing projects, though Rix knew his taste ran to American history and biographies.\\n\\n When Edwin had left him, Rix put his suitcase on the bed and opened it. Inside, amid the clothes, were a dozen bottles of vitamins. He\u0027d begun consuming megadoses more than three years ago, when he\u0027d looked in the mirror and seen himself aging almost supernaturally fast. He thought that if he took enough vitamins his appetite would pick up. Still, he ate barely enough to keep a bird alive. He thought that they were doing some good, though. At least his hair had stopped falling out in clumps.\\n\\n In the bathroom, he drew tap water into a glass and downed several capsules from each bottle.\\n\\n \"Welcome home,\" he said to the old man in the mirror. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/usher-s-passing/page-4.html","bookId":2474,"book":{"id":2474,"title":"Usher\u0027s Passing","description":"Storyline: In this most gothic of Robert McCammon\u0027s novels, setting is key: the continuing saga of the Usher family (descended from the brother of Roderick and Madeline of Edgar Poe\u0027s \"Fall of the House of Usher\") takes place in the weird and picturesque heart of the North Carolina mountains.
