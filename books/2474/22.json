{"id":82959,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"\"WHAT I\u0027D LIKE TO KNOW,\" RAVEN DUNSTAN SAID FIRMLY, \"IS why you don\u0027t deputize about thirty men and take bloodhounds up on Briartop Mountain. Surely you\u0027ve at least considered it!\" Sitting across the desk from her, in his Taylorville office, was Walt Kemp, the county sheriff. He was a thickset man with a gray crewcut and full gray sideburns. His square-jawed face was heavily lined, his dark brown eyes now bored with the interview, giving him the appearance of what he actually was: a man who worked in the weather, a well-to-do tobacco farmer with some law enforcement training who\u0027d decided to run for county sheriff because the last man was just so damned lazy. He was in his second year in office, and he was ready to give it up. It wasn\u0027t that crime was so bad in the county - it wasn\u0027t, except for a few burglaries, auto thefts, and moonshine stills - but the paperwork was mountainous. His office was understaffed, his budget had been slashed, and now here was Raven Dunstan again, pursuing her favorite subject with the tenacity of a coon dog. \"I don\u0027t think I could find five men who\u0027d want to hike up there,\" he replied, lighting a cigarette. \"And yes, I\u0027ve considered it. As a matter of fact, last year I did take two men up with hounds. And y\u0027know what happened? Somebody shot one of the dogs with rock salt and started shootin\u0027 at us, too, before we\u0027d hardly gotten out of our cars. I reckon they figured we were gonna find a still or something.\" \"So you gave up? Why?\" \"We didn\u0027t give up. We just figured we couldn\u0027t search too well with rock salt in our asses, excuse my French.\" He took a pull from his cigarette and exhaled the smoke through his nostrils. \"Those Briartop people are mean as hell, Miss Dunstan. They don\u0027t want what they call \u0027outsiders\u0027 on their territory - and I\u0027ve found out that means me, too. You know, I deputized one man up there - Clint Perry. He\u0027s the only one who\u0027d even listen to me when I tried to find volunteers. The rest of those mountain folks just don\u0027t want to be bothered.\" She shook her head. \"I can\u0027t believe this! You\u0027re the county sheriff. It\u0027s your job to \u0027bother\u0027 them!\" \"They don\u0027t want my help.\" Kemp was trying to control his temper. Wheeler\u0027s daughter, he thought, could worry the warts off a toadfrog. \"When they come at you with guns, what are you gonna do? When they fell trees across the road to block the way, what are you gonna do? Clint tries to help me out as much as he can, but he\u0027s just one man. And the folks up there treat him like he\u0027s poison for the help he does give me! I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you, they don\u0027t want the law up there.\" \"I want to read something to you,\" she said, and brought out a notepad from her purse. \"When I took the paper over from my father, I went back through the old copies of the Democrat. Dad keeps them bound in books at the house. I went over every reference to missing children that I could find, and I want to tell you what I came up with.\" \"Shoot,\" he offered. \"Since 1872,\" Raven said, \"there have been three or four incidents every year except one, in 1893, the year of the Briartop \u0027quake. At least three or four. And those are the ones that were reported. How many others might there be? Add it up. It comes out to more than three hundred. Most of the incidents took place in October and November. Harvest time. Three hundred children, all aged between six and fourteen, all from an area that includes Briartop Mountain, Foxton, Rainbow, and Taylorville. Now don\u0027t you think that\u0027s worth \u0027bothering\u0027 somebody about?\" \"You don\u0027t have to get sarcastic about it, now.\" Kemp drew so hard on his cigarette that he almost scorched his thick fingers. \"When you came to me wantin\u0027 to see the missin\u0027 persons files and all that stuff, I thought you\u0027d write stories about how hard I\u0027ve been workin\u0027 on this thing - not articles takin\u0027 me to hell and back. I even gave you the name of that Tharpe boy as a favor.\" \"I appreciate the favor, but I don\u0027t see you doing a damned thing about it.\" \"What can I do, woman?\" he said, more loudly than he\u0027d wanted. The secretary\u0027s typing in the outer office suddenly silenced. \"Move up to Briartop myself? Sure, something\u0027s goin\u0027 on up there! I ain\u0027t sayin\u0027 it\u0027s been goin\u0027 on since 1872, \u0027cause I wasn\u0027t around back then! And I\u0027d say that figure you\u0027ve come up with is probably a bit inflated, if those other Dunstans were anything like you and old Wheeler! Okay, we\u0027ve got kids steppin\u0027 into thin air. And I do mean thin air, Miss Dunstan! There\u0027s not a trace of \u0027em left. Not a piece of clothing, not a footprint, nothin\u0027! When you ask questions on Briartop, you get some damned hillbilly holdin\u0027 a gun in your face. What am I gonna do?\" Raven didn\u0027t reply. She closed her notepad and returned it to her purse. The sheriff was right, she knew. If all the others were as resistant as Myra Tharpe, how could any decent search be carried out? \"I don\u0027t know,\" she said finally. \"Right.\" He stabbed the cigarette out with an angry thrust. Splotches of color burned on his jowls. \"Neither do I. You know what I think?\" He pinned her gaze with his own. \"There\u0027s no such thing as the Pumpkin Man. It\u0027s a made-up story to scare the children. Whenever a kid goes wanderin\u0027 off into the woods and doesn\u0027t come home, it\u0027s supposed to be the Pumpkin Man got him. Well, what about the ones who just get themselves lost? Or the ones who run away from home? You know, those cabins up there ain\u0027t mansions. I\u0027ll bet plenty of kids run away to the city.\" \"Six-year-olds?\" she asked pointedly. Kemp folded his hands together on his blotter-topped desk. He looked more weary today, Raven thought, than she\u0027d ever seen him. \"I\u0027ve gone up on Briartop a couple of times,\" he told her in a quieter tone of voice. \"All by myself. Do you know how big it is? How thick those woods are? The thorns up there\u0027ll cut you like knives. You can walk ten feet off a path and get yourself so lost your head spins. There are caves and ravines and craters and God knows whatall. You know what\u0027s up at the very tiptop? A whole damned town, that\u0027s what.\" \"A town? What kind of town?\" \"Well, it\u0027s just ruins, is all. But it was a town, a long time ago. Nobody lives there but one old crazy bird who calls himself the Mountain King.\" He picked at an offending hangnail for a few seconds. \"And I\u0027ll tell you somethin\u0027 else,\" he decided. \"Clint Perry says he wouldn\u0027t go up to those ruins if you paid him five hundred bucks.\" \"That\u0027s a brave deputy you\u0027ve got. Is he afraid of one old man?\" \"Hell, no! Listen, you\u0027re not puttin\u0027 all this in your newspaper, are you? I thought I made it real clear that what I say is off the record.\" \"It\u0027s clear,\" she agreed. If she didn\u0027t need the man\u0027s confidential information from time to time, Raven would have blasted him out of this office by now. \"The damned place is haunted,\" Kemp said. He gave a quick, crooked grin to let her know he didn\u0027t really believe it. \"At least that\u0027s what Perry says. I\u0027ve been up there once, and once was enough. Some of the old stone walls are still standin\u0027, but they\u0027re as black as soot - and I swear to God, you can see the outlines of people burned right into the walls. Now you can laugh if you want to.\" Raven might have smiled wryly, but the expression in Kemp\u0027s eyes stopped her. He was dead serious, she saw. \"People in the walls, huh?\" \"No, I didn\u0027t say that. I said the outlines of people. You know, silhouettes. It\u0027ll give you the creeps to see \u0027em, I guaran-damn-tee it!\" \"What happened up there?\" He shrugged. \"Hell if I know, but I\u0027ve heard all kinds of crazy stories about Briartop Mountain. Supposed to be that comets fell one summer night and set the whole mountain on fire. \u0027Course, you know about the black panther that\u0027s supposed to be roamin\u0027 around up there. Bastard gets bigger every year. Then there\u0027s the stories about the witches, too. All kinds of fool - \" \"The witches?\" Raven interrupted. \"I hadn\u0027t heard that one.\" \"Yeah, supposed to be that Briartop used to be crawlin\u0027 with \u0027em. Gil Partain, over in Rainbow, says his grandmother used to talk about \u0027em before she died. Said that God Hisself tried to destroy Briartop Mountain. Guess it didn\u0027t work, though, \u0027cause it\u0027s still there.\" Raven glanced at her wristwatch and saw that she was going to be late for her meeting with Rix Usher. This visit with Sheriff Kemp had been totally unproductive. She put her purse strap around her shoulder and rose to leave. \"I\u0027ll keep you posted,\" Kemp said, lifting his bulk from the chair. \"I told you them stories by way of sayin\u0027 that you can\u0027t believe everything you hear. There ain\u0027t no Pumpkin Man. One of these days, somebody\u0027ll find that Tharpe boy\u0027s bones at the bottom of a cliff, or caught down in some thorns where he couldn\u0027t get loose.\" \"Then that just leaves us the other two hundred ninety-nine to find, doesn\u0027t it?\" She left his office before he could reply. Haven made the drive from Taylorville to Foxton in twenty minutes, and walked into the Broadleaf Cafe just after three. The place was almost empty, except for the bored waitress with the double-dip hairdo and a stocky, bearded man in overalls sitting at the counter with a doughnut and a cup of coffee. Rix Usher was waiting in the same booth they\u0027d occupied yesterday. \"Sorry I\u0027m late,\" she said as she slid in. \"I was over in Taylorville.\" \"That\u0027s okay, I just got here.\" Again, he\u0027d parked the red Thunderbird around the corner where it wouldn\u0027t be seen. After lunch, he\u0027d sheltered himself in his room to look through some of the materials he\u0027d taken from the library last night. The old account books were filled with scribblings and monetary figures, mostly illegible. The letters were more revealing; the majority were from bank presidents, gunpowder suppliers, and steel company presidents, and had to do with Erik\u0027s business affairs. A few of the letters, however, were from women. Two of those, still bearing a faint scent of lavender, were positively lewd, describing nights of bestial sex-and-whipping sessions. At two-thirty, Rix had slipped away from the Gatehouse. Raven waved the waitress away before she could reach the table. \"I talked to Dad last night about your proposal,\" she said. \"The first thing is that he doesn\u0027t trust you any more than he could run a hundred-yard dash. The second thing is that he wants to meet you.\" Better yet, Rix thought. \"When?\" \"How about right now? My car\u0027s out front, if you want to leave yours here.\" Rix nodded. In a few minutes he was sitting in Raven\u0027s Volkswagen as she drove out of Foxton and turned onto a narrow country road north of the town limits. He had the opportunity to settle back and really look at Raven Dunstan. She had strong, even features and thick, curly black hair that accentuated her fair complexion. She wore very little makeup, and Rix didn\u0027t think she needed any. She was naturally attractive, with a strong, earthy sensuality. There was strength in her eyes and in the set of her jaw, and Rix wondered what she\u0027d look like when she laughed. She looked unafraid to go anywhere or do anything; she had guts, he decided. Otherwise, she never would have kept calling Usherland until she finally wore down the opposition. He realized that he actually liked her. But in the next moment he shifted his position and looked away. His feelings for Sandra were still strong; until he could resolve the question of why she\u0027d killed herself in that bathtub, he couldn\u0027t let her go. Raven had felt him watching her, and glanced quickly at him. Though he appeared wan and tired, she thought he was a striking-looking man. He needed light in his eyes, she decided. They held an inner darkness that disturbed her. \"How\u0027d you get involved with the Democrat? Why didn\u0027t you go after a job on a city newspaper, or get into television journalism?\u0027\u0027 \"Oh, I worked for a city paper for a while. I was a feature editor for almost three years with a paper in Memphis. But when Dad called me, I had to come home. The Democrat\u0027s been in my family for a long time. Besides, Dad needed help with his book.\" \"Then you help him write it, too?\" \"No. In fact, I\u0027ve never seen any of the book. He won\u0027t even let me come around when he\u0027s working on it. My father\u0027s a very private person, Mr. Usher. And he\u0027s a very proud and stubborn man, as well.\" \"That\u0027s not exactly the opinion my father has of him,\" Rix commented, and saw her smile faintly. It was a nice smile, and Rix hoped to see it again. Raven took a left onto a long gravel drive. It climbed gently through pine woods to a gabled, two-story white house at the top of a hill, overlooking a magnificent vista of sky and mountains. \"Welcome to the homestead,\" Raven said. As he followed her up the steps to the porch, Rix almost asked her about her limp - but then the front door opened and he had his first glimpse of Wheeler Dunstan.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/usher-s-passing/page-22.html","bookId":2474,"book":{"id":2474,"title":"Usher\u0027s Passing","description":"Storyline: In this most gothic of Robert McCammon\u0027s novels, setting is key: the continuing saga of the Usher family (descended from the brother of Roderick and Madeline of Edgar Poe\u0027s \"Fall of the House of Usher\") takes place in the weird and picturesque heart of the North Carolina mountains. The haughty, aristocratic Ushers live in a mansion near Asheville; the poor but crafty mountain folk (whose families are just as ancient) live on Briartop Mountain nearby. At harvest time, when the book\u0027s action unfolds, the mountains are a blaze of color. Add to the mixture a sinister history of mountain kids disappearing every year, a journalist investigating those disappearances, a monster called \"The Pumpkin Man,\" moldy books and paintings in a huge old library at the Usher estate, and a secret chamber with a strange device involving a brass pendulum and tuning forks--and you\u0027ve got a splendid recipe for atmospheric horror.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/usher-s-passing.jpg","author":"Robert McCammon","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/usher-s-passing.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:46:55 PM"}}
