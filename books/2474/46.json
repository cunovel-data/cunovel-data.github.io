The cause of death, according to Dr. John Howard Francis of Boston, was massive cerebral hemorrhage. On November 2, private funeral services were held at the estate, attended by many government and armed forces officials.\\n\\n Survivors include his wife, Margaret Usher, a daughter, Kattrina Usher; and two sons, Boone and Rix Usher.\\n\\n Rix Usher has been named successor to the family business. Through a spokesperson, Boone and Kattrina Usher have announced extended travel plans.\\n\\n Within hours of Usher\u0027s passing, a violent series of earth tremors, localized in the Briartop Mountain area, leveled Usher\u0027s Lodge, the 143-year-old landmark constructed by Hudson Usher. According to Rix Usher, there are no plans to rebuild.\\n\\n The tremors, which were felt as far away as Asheville, shattered windows in Foxton, Taylorville, and Rainbow City. Taken to the Foxton clinic for treatment of injuries caused by flying glass were Neville S. Winston, Betty Chesley, Elton Weir, and Johnny Faber, all of Foxton.\\n\\n Geologists at the University of North Carolina are puzzled by the tremors, and are currently beginning a study of the area in hopes of finding their origin.\\n\\n The Briartop Mountain-Foxton area suffered an earthquake in the autumn of 1893 that caused severe property damage and left more than twenty mountain residents dead.\\n\\n The staff and management of the Foxton Democrat wish to offer their condolences to the family of Walen Usher.\\n\\n It was the middle of January, and a cold wind was blowing as Raven stopped her Volkswagen before the closed gates of Usherland. She lifted the collar of her coat up around her neck and then rolled her window down. Within reach was a small speaker. She pressed the mechanism\u0027s button and waited.\\n\\n \"Yes?\" the voice asked.\\n\\n \"Raven Dunstan. Mr. Usher\u0027s expecting me.\"\\n\\n The gates clicked open to admit her. After her car had passed through, the gates locked themselves again.\\n\\n She was met at the front door of the Gatehouse by a young maid who took her coat, then escorted her not to the living room - where she\u0027d been several times since that horrible day - but upstairs, along a corridor where the only sound was that of a softly ticking grandfather clock. Raven was led to a staircase that ascended to a white door with a silver knob.\\n\\n \"Mr. Usher\u0027s waitin\u0027 for you,\" the maid said. She glanced nervously up the stairs.\\n\\n \"Thank you.\" Raven climbed up to the door, then paused. There was the faintest hint of an unpleasant odor in the air. It smelled like meat that was going bad. She knocked at the door. The silence of the house unnerved her. When Rix didn\u0027t answer, she opened the door and peered inside.\\n\\n He was sitting on the edge of a large bed with a bare mattress. There were no lights in the room, and no windows, and he squinted as he looked toward the door. \"Raven?\" he asked. \"Come in. You can leave the door open, if you like.\"\\n\\n She entered, and approached him. The smell was stronger in here. The walls, she saw, were coated with rubber, and she knew this was the Quiet Room that Rix had told her about - the room where Walen Usher had died.\\n\\n Rix was wearing an expensive gray suit and a blue-striped tie. In the tie was a small diamond stickpin. His face was wan and tired, as if he\u0027d gone without sleep for a long time; there were dark circles beneath his eyes. He looked at her with a troubled gaze, and Raven saw that he held the ebony scepter across his knees.\\n\\n \"I came as soon as I could get away from the office,\" she said. \"Are you all right?\"\\n\\n He smiled faintly. \"I\u0027m not sure. I\u0027m not sure of anything anymore.\"\\n\\n \"Neither am I,\" she told him. It was cold in here, and she hugged her arms around herself for warmth. \"Dad\u0027s getting better,\" she offered. \"The doctor says he\u0027s making real progress. He knew who I was the last time I visited.\"\\n\\n \"Good. I\u0027m glad.\" He ran his hand over the smooth ebony. \"My mother\u0027s found a condominium, at last. She says I ought to come out to Hawaii sometime for a vacation.\"\\n\\n \"Does she . . . know about Boone and Kattrina yet?\"\\n\\n \"I think she really wants to believe that Katt is in Italy and Boone is on a tour of Europe. Of course, she knows something\u0027s wrong. If she lets herself realize that they\u0027re dead, she\u0027ll go to pieces. She\u0027ll have to know sometime, I guess, but I\u0027ll cross that bridge when I come to it. I\u0027m . . . really grateful for that story you wrote, Raven. I still don\u0027t understand why you didn\u0027t blow the lid off everything, but I want you to know how much I appreciate it.\"\\n\\n She had had the chance of a lifetime, she knew, but she\u0027d let it go. What was the point? The Pumpkin Man was dead - the chain of Pumpkin Men broken - and there would be no more children vanishing without a trace. There was still so much she couldn\u0027t comprehend about what she\u0027d been through; sometimes it seemed like only a particularly nasty dream. Except that her limp had never returned, her father was in a sanitarium, and Usher\u0027s Lodge lay in ruins. Down deep, though, she was repelled by the thought of writing a story that would tell the mountain people exactly where their children had been going over the years. Her perception of evil had been sharpened dramatically, and when she saw a report of missing children in another newspaper, her flesh broke out in cold goosebumps. The Democrat\u0027s circulation continued to climb, and New Tharpe was working out just fine as a copyboy. Pretty soon, she intended to let him write his first story for the paper - but for the time being, he was going to school like any other normal kid.\\n\\n \"I got a letter yesterday,\" Rix said. \"It was from Puddin\u0027 Usher. She\u0027s in New York City now, and she wrote to tell me that she\u0027d just signed a contract with a publisher.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n Rix nodded, a grim smile stitched across his mouth. \"They\u0027re going to pay her a hundred thousand dollars to write an account of her life as an Usher. She\u0027s going to do talk shows and newspaper interviews. Isn\u0027t that a kick in the ass?\"\\n\\n \"Can she do that?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. My lawyer\u0027s looking into it right now. Jesus,\" he said softly. \"Listen to me. I think I sound more and more like my father, every day. I look in the mirror and see his face staring out.\"\\n\\n \"What have you decided to do? About your condition, I mean?\"\\n\\n \"No more Welsh pies,\" he said, and she winced. \"Sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to say that. Dr. Francis called me. He still wants to run the tests I told you about. I\u0027d have to go to Boston and stay in the hospital for a couple of weeks.\"\\n\\n \"Are you going?\"\\n\\n \"I want to, but . . . what if there\u0027s no cure for the Malady, Raven? What if it\u0027s so deep in the Usher genes that there\u0027s no way to root it out? I watched my father die, right on this bed. What I saw I wouldn\u0027t have wished on anyone. Not even him.\" He looked up at her pleadingly, and whispered, \"I\u0027m . . . so afraid.\"\\n\\n \"But you have a chance,\" Raven said. \"All the other Ushers had that chance and turned away from it. But you\u0027ve got the best chance of all; with modern medical technology, there\u0027s a real possibility the Malady can be controlled, Rix. Isn\u0027t that what you said Dr. Francis told you?\"\\n\\n \"He said they\u0027d give it their best shot. But what if it isn\u0027t good enough? What if I have to die in this room, just as my father did?\"\\n\\n She shook her head.-\"You\u0027re not your father, Rix. You see things your own way. You don\u0027t have to live the same kind of life. But it\u0027s up to you to make the effort to change things. If you don\u0027t . . . who will?\"\\n\\n \"I can still smell him in here,\" Rix said, and closed his eyes. His fingers caressed the scepter. \"He\u0027s inside me. All of them - Hudson, Aram, Ludlow, Erik, Walen - they\u0027re all inside me. I can\u0027t escape from them, no matter how hard I try.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she agreed, \"you can\u0027t. But you can be the Usher who makes the difference for all the Ushers to come.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m the last of the line, Raven. It dies with me. I wouldn\u0027t bring a child into the Usher world.\"\\n\\n \"I see. Then you\u0027ve decided to turn your back on life? Are you going to lock yourself in up here and swallow the key? Damn it, Rix, you have everything and you can\u0027t see it! And I\u0027m not talking about the money - you\u0027d probably be happier if you started using it instead of letting it sit in banks. \"Think of the schools you could build with it! The hospitals! Think of the people who need homes and food, and there are plenty of those right in this area! You have the chance, Rix! You can be a thousand times the man any other Usher ever was!\"\\n\\n She was right, Rix knew. The first thing he could do was to build some decent houses for the people on Briartop Mountain - some brick houses, far better than the cabins that leaked rainwater like sieves. There were people who needed food and shelter, and kids like New Tharpe who wanted the opportunity of education, to stretch their boundaries far beyond the limits of their present lives. One-tenth of the Usher fortune could create a university complex that would be unsurpassed anywhere.\\n\\n \"Will you go to Boston with me?\" he asked.\\n\\n She paused, trying to read his eyes. There was light in them now. \"I\u0027d like that,\" she replied. \"Yes. I\u0027d like that very much.\"\\n\\n \"I . . . asked you here because I need your help in a decision I\u0027ve been trying to make. I don\u0027t know if I can make it alone, but it\u0027s a very important one.\"\\n\\n \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"Usher Armaments,\" he said. \"It\u0027s got to be shut down. The weapons have got to stop rolling off those assembly lines, Raven.\"\\n\\n \"If that\u0027s your decision,\" she told him firmly, \"the Democrat will stand behind you.\"\\n\\n Rix rose from the bed. He began pressing buttons on the control console, and the television screens flickered on, showing scenes of the Usher world. In the glow, Rix\u0027s face was heavily lined. \"I want to shut it down, but my sister was right. Someone will always make the weapons. Does that mean there\u0027ll always be wars? Are we so hopeless that we can see no end to the destruction? My God . . . I\u0027ve thought about this day after day, and I still can\u0027t decide. If I shut down Usher Armaments, more than six thousand people will lose their jobs. If I don\u0027t, there\u0027ll be no end to the weapons; they\u0027ll get more insidious, more deadly, year by year.\"\\n\\n He held the scepter up before her. His hand was shaking. \"I know what this means now, and what it meant to all the Ushers - power. Why can\u0027t I throw this away? Why can\u0027t I snap it over my knee? God, I\u0027ve tried! But something inside me doesn\u0027t want to give up the power!\"\\n\\n Rix\u0027s face was tormented with doubts. \"Do I shut down Usher Armaments, and lose whatever influence I might have over this madness? Or do I let the factories churn out the bombs and missiles, and join the madness? What do I decide?\"\\n\\n \"Excuse me, Mr. Usher?\"\\n\\n Rix looked toward the door, where the maid stood. \"Yes? What is it?\"\\n\\n \"You have some visitors, sir. A General McVair and a General Berger. Mr. Meredith\u0027s with them, and they\u0027re askin\u0027 permission to come through the front gates.\"\\n\\n Rix sighed deeply and let the air trickle from his nostrils. \"All right, Mary,\" he said finally. \"Let them come in.\" He ran a hand across his face. \"I knew I couldn\u0027t keep them away for long,\" he told Raven. \"They\u0027re going to be carrying their briefcases and their plans. They\u0027re going to smile and tell me how good I look, considering Walen\u0027s tragic death. Then it\u0027ll start, Raven. What do I tell them?\"\\n\\n \"Whatever you decide,\" she said, \"I\u0027ll help you. I\u0027ll stand with you. Use your chance. Be the Usher who makes a difference.\"\\n\\n Rix stared at her, and suddenly he knew what decision he would make when he faced those smiling generals in his father\u0027s house. He prayed to God that it would be the right one.\\n\\n He took Raven\u0027s hand, and they went down to face the future. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/usher-s-passing/page-46.html","bookId":2474,"book":{"id":2474,"title":"Usher\u0027s Passing","description":"Storyline: In this most gothic of Robert McCammon\u0027s novels, setting is key: the continuing saga of the Usher family (descended from the brother of Roderick and Madeline of Edgar Poe\u0027s \"Fall of the House of Usher\") takes place in the weird and picturesque heart of the North Carolina mountains.
