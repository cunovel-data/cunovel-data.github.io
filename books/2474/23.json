{"id":82960,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"RIX\u0027S INITIAL THOUGHT, MACABRE AS IT WAS, WAS THAT THE OLD man\u0027s first name was appropriate. Dunstan was confined to a motorized wheelchair that he controlled by a lever in the armrest gearbox.\n \"That\u0027s far enough,\" Dunstan commanded in a voice like the grating of coarse sandpaper. \"Let me look at you.\"\n Rix stopped. The old man\u0027s brilliant blue eyes - almost the same shade as his daughter\u0027s, but much colder - examined him from head to foot, as Rix did the same to Wheeler Dunstan. He was probably in his early sixties, with close-cropped, iron-gray hair and the hard-bitten look of a Marine drill sergeant. He had a short gray beard and mustache that further enhanced his bristling appearance. Though the man\u0027s legs looked thin and shriveled in the jeans he wore, his upper body was knotty and muscular; his forearms, exposed by the rolled-up sleeves of a faded blue workshirt, were twice the girth of Rix\u0027s. His thick neck indicated that he\u0027d been a man of some power before whatever happened to put him in that chair, and Rix guessed he might still be able to straighten out a horseshoe with his bare hands. Clenched between his teeth was a fist-sized corncob pipe, and blue smoke came from his mouth in quick, haughty puffs.\n \"I\u0027m unarmed, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re looking for,\" Rix said.\n Dunstan smiled just a fraction, but his eyes remained wary. \"You\u0027ve got the Usher look, all right. Quick, boy - what\u0027s the name of the police chief who threw you in the clink after that peace march?\"\n \"Bill Blanchard. His nickname was \u0027Bulldog.\u0027 \"\n \"Your mother goes to a plastic surgeon in New York. What\u0027s his name? Quick.\"\n \"Dr. Martin Steiner. And he\u0027s not in New York, he\u0027s in Los Angeles.\" Rix lifted his eyebrows. \"Want me to name the winner of the \u002748 World Series?\"\n \"If you can, I\u0027ll throw your ass off this porch. The real Rix Usher doesn\u0027t know shit about sports.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t realize I had to pass an oral exam.\"\n \"Yep,\" Dunstan replied. He puffed on his pipe, taking his time in sizing Rix up, then removed it from his mouth and motioned toward the door with a jerk of his head. \"Come on in, then.\"\n It was clearly a man\u0027s house, full of dark wood and functional, inexpensive pine furniture. An electric lift attached to the staircase was used to convey the wheelchair to the second floor. Shelves around the red brick fireplace in the large parlor held such found objects as smooth river stones, dried Indian corncobs, an intricately woven bird\u0027s nest, and an assortment of pinecones. A framed front page of the Foxton Democrat shouted, in three-inch-tall black letters, WAR DECLARED. Also on the walls were oil paintings of various barns.\n \"I did those,\" Dunstan announced, noting Rix\u0027s interest.\n \"I\u0027ve got a studio at the back of the house. I like the texture and look of barns. Painting \u0027em relaxes me. Sit down.\"\n Rix settled into a chair with his back to the wall. The house smelled strongly of aromatic pipe tobacco. Light filtered in through a pair of ceiling-high bay windows that faced the mountain view. In the distance Rix could see the new bank building in Foxton, and the white steeple of the Foxton First Baptist Church.\n Raven sat on the parlor couch a few feet away from Rix, where she could watch both him and her father. The old man\u0027s chair whirred forward until his knees were almost touching Rix\u0027s; for an instant Rix felt trapped, a traitor in the enemy\u0027s camp. Dunstan tapped his fingers on the armrests, his head cocked slightly to one side.\n \"What\u0027re you doin\u0027 here?\" the old man asked, his eyes hooded. \"You\u0027re Walen Ushers boy.\" The word boy was spoken with a sneer.\n \"I\u0027m his son, but I\u0027m not his \u0027boy.\u0027 If you know me as well as you pretend, you\u0027re aware of that.\"\n \"I know you\u0027ve been the black sheep of the family. I know you\u0027ve been livin\u0027 in another state for the last seven years. You look older than I expected.\"\n \"I\u0027m thirty-three,\" Rix said.\n \"Well, time does things to people.\" Dunstan\u0027s hands wandered down to touch his crippled legs. \"What\u0027s your story, then? Why\u0027d you agree to come here?\"\n \"I explained the deal to your daughter yesterday. For the information I\u0027ve got about Walen and his successor, I want to see your manuscript and know where you\u0027re getting your research material.\"\n \"The manuscript\u0027s locked up,\" Dunstan said flatly. \"I won\u0027t show my book to anyone.\"\n \"Then I don\u0027t guess we\u0027ve got anything to discuss.\"\n Rix started to rise, but the old man said, \"Wait a minute. I didn\u0027t say that.\"\n \"Okay, I\u0027m listening.\"\n Dunstan glanced quickly at his daughter, then back to Rix. \"I\u0027ve put in six years on that manuscript. No way in hell am I gonna let anybody see it. But we might still strike a deal, Mr. Usher. Anything you want to know that\u0027s in the book, I\u0027ll tell you. And I\u0027ll show you how I\u0027m writing it. But first you tell us what we want to know: What\u0027s your father\u0027s condition, and who\u0027s going to take over the business?\"\n Rix paused thoughtfully. Traitor, betrayer, turncoat - all the definitions applied. But then he thought of how Walen\u0027s belt had stung his legs, of how Boone had grinned before the fist had smashed down, of how the skeleton had swung in the De Peyser doorway. When are you gonna write somethin\u0027 about us, Rixy? And in that instant, Rix was certain of his true purpose in coming to this house: somehow he had to take control of the book that Wheeler Dunstan was writing. He hoped the flash of realization in his eyes hadn\u0027t given him away. But first he had to test the man. \"No,\" he said firmly. \"It won\u0027t work that way. You might not have a damned thing. I\u0027m taking a chance being here. First you have to prove to me that you\u0027ve got something I might be interested in knowing.\"\n Now it was the old man\u0027s turn to consider. Smoke curled from his mouth. \"What do you think?\" he asked Raven.\n \"I\u0027m not sure. I may be dead wrong . . . but I think we can trust him.\"\n Dunstan grunted softly, his brows knit. \"All right,\" he said. \"What do you want to know?\"\n It came to him in the quick recollection of the angel strumming its lyre. \"Simms Usher,\" Rix said. \"Tell me about him.\"\n Dunstan looked relieved, as if he\u0027d been prepared for a heavier question. \"Simms was your father\u0027s younger brother. Nora St. Clair Usher\u0027s second child. There\u0027s not much to tell, really - except that he was retarded. Not severely, but enough so that Erik didn\u0027t have very much to do with him. Erik despised imperfection. Simms died when he was six years old. That\u0027s it.\"\n That was all? Why had Walen never mentioned Simms, then? Was he ashamed of having a retarded brother? \"How did he die? Something to do with his condition?\"\n \"Nope,\" Dunstan said. \"An animal killed Simms.\"\n Rix\u0027s interest perked up. \"An animal? What kind of animal?\"\n \"A wild animal,\" the old man said dryly. \"I don\u0027t know what kind.\" His pipe had gone out; he took it from his mouth to relight it with a match from his shirt pocket. \"A gardener found what was left of the body. There wasn\u0027t much. Simms had wandered away from the Lodge, chasin\u0027 butterflies or something. An animal got him in the woods.\" His match flared. \"When the locals heard about it, there were all kinds of opinions. Some said Erik wanted the boy to be killed. Others said the animal was one of those that escaped from the burnin\u0027 zoo about four years earlier. Anyway, it was never found. About two months after Simms died, Nora left Usherland and never came back.\"\n \"She left Walen with Erik? Where\u0027d she go?\"\n \"St. Augustine, Florida. She married a Greek who owned a fleet of fishing boats, and she started teaching retarded children in a school down there. She taught right up until the day she died, in 1966. They put a statue of her up in the front yard.\" He regarded Rix through a veil of smoke. \"That\u0027s all about Simms. I thought you were gonna ask me about something nobody else knows.\"\n If what Dunstan had told him was true, it was obvious the man knew his facts very well. But how had he gotten those facts? \"I found Nora\u0027s diary in the Gatehouse library,\" Rix said. \"Do you know about the deal Erik struck with St. Clair Stables?\"\n \"Sure. Three million dollars bought Nora and four stud horses. Ludlow Usher signed the bank draft.\"\n Rix remembered a bit of information from the diary which he could use to really test Dunstan\u0027s knowledge. \"Erik had a particular horse in mind to win the Kentucky Derby. Do you know its name?\"\n He smiled faintly around his pipe. \"King South. Erik scrubbed that horse down with beer and spent over a hundred thousand dollars on a special stall with fans and steam heating. He let the horse run free through the Lodge. Of course you know what happened at the 1922 Derby?\"\n Rix shook his head.\n \"King South was ahead by two lengths at the far turn when he staggered and hit the rail,\" Dunstan said. \"He went down. The infield observers swore they could hear the leg break. Or it might have been the jockey\u0027s back they heard crackin\u0027. In any case, King South had to be destroyed right on the track. Erik and Nora had watched the whole thing from their private box, though there\u0027s no record of Erik\u0027s response. They returned directly to Usherland. Around two o\u0027clock the next morning, Erik went crazy and set fire to his zoo. A rumor is that Erik had the carcass of King South stuffed and mounted in his bedroom. A visitor from Washington supposedly found Erik stark naked, ridin\u0027 that stuffed horse and whippin\u0027 its flanks as if he were racin\u0027 in the Derby. Any truth to that?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve never been up to Erik\u0027s bedroom.\"\n \"Okay.\" Dunstan gave out one last puff of smoke and removed the pipe from his mouth. He leaned slightly toward Rix, his stare unyielding. \"Let\u0027s hear it about Walen. What\u0027s going on?\"\n The moment of truth, Rix thought. An unfamiliar sense of family loyalty tugged at him. But who would he be hurting? And this man had something he desperately wanted - no, desperately needed. \"Walen\u0027s dying,\" Rix said. \"Dr. John Francis from Boston is attending to him, but he doesn\u0027t see much hope. He thinks Walen may go anytime.\"\n \"Raven already figured that out,\" Dunstan replied. \"Francis is a specialist in cell degeneration. But there\u0027s no stopping the Malady\u0027s progress, is there? Old Walen must be locked in his Quiet Room by now.\" A flicker of pleasure passed across his face. \"I\u0027m surprised he\u0027s lasted this long. Goes to show he\u0027s a tough old bastard. Now tell us something we don\u0027t know: Who\u0027s going to control the estate and the business?\"\n Rix paused with the name on his lips. He was betraying family secrets for the sake of gaining the trust of Wheeler Dunstan; he told himself that if he didn\u0027t, he had no chance of getting his hands on that manuscript. Rix said, \"Kattrina. My sister\u0027s going to take over the business.\"\n Wheeler Dunstan was silent; then he gave a soft, low whistle. \"Shitfire,\" he said. \"I always thought it would be Boone. Then, when I found out you were comin\u0027 back, I assumed you were in the runnin\u0027.\"\n \"I\u0027m not. I despise the business.\"\n \"So I\u0027ve heard, but ten billion dollars can change hate to love. That\u0027s about what Usher Armaments is worth, isn\u0027t it? Kattrina, huh? You sure about that?\"\n \"Fairly certain. Dad\u0027s been talking with her a lot, alone. She wants the responsibility, and she\u0027s got a good record of success.\"\n \"The weapons business is a whole hell of a lot different from modelin\u0027. Of course, she\u0027ll be surrounded by top-flight advisors and technical experts. All she has to do is sign her name to Pentagon contracts. Still . . . you wouldn\u0027t be tryin\u0027 to blow smoke in my face, would you?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Why would he lie?\" Raven ventured to her father. \"There\u0027s no point in it.\"\n \"Maybe,\" Dunstan said carefully. \"I don\u0027t think Boone\u0027ll lie down and play dead, though. He\u0027s acted the role of Usher heir in every go-go joint in Asheville. He\u0027ll fight Kattrina for the power.\"\n \"But he\u0027ll lose. When Walen transfers everything to Katt, the papers will be ironclad.\"\n Dunstan still wasn\u0027t convinced. \"Kattrina\u0027s got a reputation for drug use. She\u0027s gone through everything from LSD to angel dust. Why would Walen pass the business on to a drughead?\"\n \"She\u0027s off drugs,\" Rix said. Sullen anger burned in his stomach. Discussing Katt with a stranger like this was repellent. \"Anyway, that\u0027s none of your damned business.\"\n Dunstan\u0027s glance at Raven held a bit of triumph in making Rix lose his cool.\n \"You\u0027ve got what you wanted,\" Rix told him. \"Now I want my part. How are you doing your research?\"\n \"I\u0027ll show you.\" The wheelchair whirred backward a few feet, and Rix rose from his chair. \"My study\u0027s down in the basement. I\u0027ll even tell you the book title: Time Will Tell the Tale. That\u0027s the first sentence, too. Come on, then.\" He led Rix, with Raven following behind, through a short corridor and to a doorway that opened onto a gently sloping concrete ramp. They went down it and into a basement that looked like any other, full of odds and ends, old clothes, and broken furniture. Dunstan rolled toward a door on the far side of the basement and took a key ring with one key and a tiny brass charm in the shape of a typewriter from his shirt pocket. He turned a lock, then pulled the door open. \"Come on, take a look.\" He returned the key ring to his pocket, reached in, and switched on the lights.\n Dunstan\u0027s study was a small, windowless room paneled in pine, with a concrete floor and a tile ceiling. Metal bookshelves that took up almost every inch of wall space held thick leatherbound volumes. Books, newspapers, and magazines stood in stacks around Dunstan\u0027s desk; atop the desk, amid a scatter of books and papers on a worn-looking brown blotter, were a telephone, a green-shaded high-intensity lamp - and a word processor, hooked up to a daisy-wheel printer.\n \"On those shelves are one hundred and thirty years of the Foxton Democrat,\" Dunstan explained. \"Every issue mentions the Ushers at least once. I\u0027ve interviewed about sixty former Usher servants, groundskeepers, carpenters, and painters. Of course. Raven does my legwork for me.\"\n \"You\u0027re writing the book on a word processor?\"\n \"That\u0027s right. Was doing the thing on a typewriter, but I bought this two years ago. It helps me with my research, too. A lot of libraries in major cities are hooked up to a computer network that lets you go through old genealogical records, rare-document collections, and church records. Whatever I need copies of, my friends at the Asheville library can get for me.\"\n Rix looked at a stack of magazines next to the desk. There were back issues of Time, Newsweek, Forbes, Business Week, and others - all containing, Rix assumed, some fact, fiction, or fancy about the Ushers. On the man\u0027s desk were a few musty-looking books and some yellowed pieces of paper covered with ornate, feminine handwriting.\n Letters, Rix thought. He pretended to be examining the word processor, but his glance veered toward the letters. He caught the words \"Dearest Erik\" on one piece of paper.\n \"That\u0027s the tour,\" Dunstan said suddenly. His voice betrayed an edge of tension, as if he realized what Rix had seen.\n Rix heard the wheelchair motor whine as Dunstan approached him; but by then Rix had picked up the letter and sniffed at the paper. The scent of faded perfume was familiar. Lavender. The letter was from the same woman who\u0027d adored Erik\u0027s whipping techniques. \"Where did you get this?\" Rix asked, turning toward Wheeler Dunstan.\n \"From an ex-servant who kept some of Erik\u0027s documents. The man lives in Georgia.\" He reached up to take it, but Rix held the letter away from him.\n \"That\u0027s bullshit. All the family records, documents, and letters are kept locked in the Lodge\u0027s basement, and they\u0027ve been down there for years. No servant would\u0027ve dared to keep anything that belonged to the family.\" He stopped, realizing the truth from Dunstan\u0027s grim, haughty expression. \"You got this from Usherland, didn\u0027t you?\"\n Dunstan\u0027s chin lifted a few notches higher. \"I\u0027ve shown you what you wanted to see. You can leave now.\"\n \"No. This letter - hell, all these letters! - came from Usherland. I want to know how you got them off the estate.\" As Dunstan stared at him defiantly, Rix felt a hammerblow of realization. \"There\u0027s a spy on the inside, isn\u0027t there? Collecting letters and whatever else he can get his hands on? Who is it?\"\n \"You don\u0027t really want to know,\" Dunstan replied. \"Not really. Now leave, why don\u0027t you? Our business is over.\"\n \"What are you going to do? Call the sheriff to make me leave?\"\n \"Rix,\" Raven said, \"please - \"\n \"I knew it was a damned fool mistake to let him come here!\" Dunstan raged to his daughter. \"We didn\u0027t need him! Shitfire!\"\n \"You\u0027ll tell me who it is,\" Rix demanded.\n Dunstan\u0027s face tightened. In his eyes was scorching fury. \"Don\u0027t you dare use that tone of voice to me, boy!\" he shouted. \"You\u0027re not at Usherland now, you\u0027re in my house! You don\u0027t snap your fingers and make me jump, you little - \" \"Dad,\" Raven interrupted, putting both hands on his knotty shoulders. \"Calm down, now, come on.\"\n \"You don\u0027t order me around,\" Dunstan told Rix, though his voice had lost some of its power. \"You hear me?\"\n \"The name.\" Rix continued as if the outburst had never happened. \"I want it.\"\n \"I know all about your childhood, boy. I know things about you that you\u0027d rather forget. I know how Boone used to beat you up, and how Walen whipped you with a belt till you bled.\" His eyes had become fierce slits. \"I know you hate Walen Usher as much as I do, boy. You don\u0027t really want that name. Just go. Take the letters, if you want \u0027em.\"\n \"The name,\" Rix repeated.\n When it was spat out to him, Rix\u0027s knees almost buckled. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/usher-s-passing/page-23.html","bookId":2474,"book":{"id":2474,"title":"Usher\u0027s Passing","description":"Storyline: \n In this most gothic of Robert McCammon\u0027s novels, setting is key: the continuing saga of the Usher family (descended from the brother of Roderick and Madeline of Edgar Poe\u0027s \"Fall of the House of Usher\") takes place in the weird and picturesque heart of the North Carolina mountains.
