{"id":82974,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"RIX HEARD THE RUMBLE OF DISTANT THUNDER AS HE SAT IN THE library, examining by candlelight one of the first items he\u0027d found: the small, moldy black book with its mathematical formulas, obscure ink sketches, and bars of music. The formulas were much too dense for Rix to follow, though he\u0027d always been pretty good at math. They resembled some sort of advanced physics project, with notations for weight and velocity. What the hell were they for? he wondered. The musical notations were particularly puzzling. They were extremely intricate, with dozens of sharps and flats. Whose composition were they, and what was their connection with the math formulas? He turned a few brittle pages and looked at the sketches of the long rods with half-moon, round, and triangular shapes at their bottoms. He felt he should know what those were; the symbols were familiar, but he couldn\u0027t quite place them. A quiet tapping at the library\u0027s door startled him. He closed the book, paused for a few seconds, and then got up, went to the door, and cracked it open. Edwin, immaculate in his Usher uniform and cap, stood outside. \"I thought you might be in there,\" he said. Rix opened the door wider to let Edwin in, and closed it again after he had entered. \"I was doing some reading. How\u0027s Dad?\" \"Sleeping. Mrs. Reynolds is back on duty now.\" Edwin appeared pale and haggard from his time spent with Walen in the Quiet Room. The skin seemed to have shrunken over Edwin\u0027s facial bones, and Rix could smell Walen on his clothes. \"You didn\u0027t have breakfast this morning,\" Edwin said. \"Cass is worried about you.\" Rix glanced at his wristwatch and saw that it was almost nine o\u0027clock. \"I\u0027m all right. I just didn\u0027t feel very much like eating this morning.\" \"You need to keep your strength up.\" He looked at the black book that Rix held. \"Did you find something of interest?\" \"I think so. Look at this.\" He went over to the desk and opened the book under the candlelight, turning to the mathematical formulas. \"Do you have any idea what this technical stuff might be?\" he asked. \"It looks to me like a physics problem.\" \"Physics?\" Edwin frowned. \"I wouldn\u0027t know. My best subject in school was English.\" He examined the figures for a moment before he shook his head. \"Sorry. I can\u0027t tell where it begins or ends.\" He showed Edwin the bars of music and the drawings. Edwin said one of the sketches reminded him of horseshoes, but he couldn\u0027t fathom the rest of them. Rix closed the book. \"Do you know anything about Dad\u0027s new project?\" he asked. \"Katt\u0027s told me it\u0027s called Pendulum, but that\u0027s all she knows.\" \"Your father\u0027s never trusted anyone with his business projects. Least of all, me. I\u0027ve seen the military men coming in and out, of course, but that\u0027s none of my concern.\" \"Haven\u0027t you ever wondered what goes on at Usher Armaments?\" \"Yes, I\u0027ve wondered. Often.\" Edwin crossed the room and regarded the portrait of Hudson Usher. \"Strong features,\" he said in a reverent tone. \"That was a man of great willpower and determination. You have his eyes, Rix.\" \"I think you\u0027re avoiding my question.\" \"Perhaps . . . I\u0027ve made certain I have avoided it, all these years.\" He turned to face Rix. In the soft golden light he was a figure of great poise and dignity, from the crown of his cap to the toes of his spit-shined shoes. The candlelight glinted off the silver buttons of his blazer. \"I told you before. I abhor war, but someone will always wage it, Rix. That is a fact of our miserable existence. You have to believe that your family\u0027s weapons help deter war. That outlook has taken me through many a cold night. It would be better for you if you could share it.\" \"How do you mean?\" \"Your peace of mind.\" Edwin took off his cap and ran a hand through his thin white hair. \"I know the pressure you\u0027ve been under these last few years. With Sandra\u0027s death, and your career difficulties - and now your father\u0027s condition. You were always it sensitive boy. I know living in the world out there has been very hard on you. Hasn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes,\" Rix said. Edwin nodded. \"When you called me that day from New York, I could hear the desperation in your voice. I heard it again when you were telling me about that family history you want to write. The world can be a treacherous place, Rix. It can destroy sensitive people.\" \"I have been under pressure,\" Rix admitted. \"A lot of it. I think . . . it must\u0027ve started when Sandra died. I loved her so much, Edwin. After she died . . . it was as if part of me had died, too - like a light being turned off. Now I just feel dark inside.\" He paused, but sensed that Edwin was waiting for him to continue. \"And . . . I\u0027ve been having nightmares. Actually, flashes of things that I can\u0027t really get a grip on. Boone hung a plastic skeleton in the door of the De Peyser\u0027s Quiet Room, so it would swing right in my face. I keep seeing that damned thing in my mind, Edwin - only it gets bloodier every time I see it. And - this sounds crazy, I know - I keep seeing something that scares the hell out of me: it looks like a doorknob, with the face of a roaring lion on it. It\u0027s made of silver, and it just floats there, in the dark. Can you think of a door like that, somewhere in the Lodge?\" \"There might be,\" Edwin answered. \"But there are thousands of doors in the Lodge, Rix. I can\u0027t say I\u0027ve paid much attention to their knobs. Why? What does the Lodge have to do with it?\" \"I\u0027m not sure, I just think . . . I must\u0027ve seen a door like that, when I was wandering in the Lodge. And that trick skeleton was plastic, but now . . . it seems so real.\" Edwin said softly, \"That was a terrible experience for you. Alone in the darkness for hours. I thank God I found you when I did. But that was a long time ago, Rix. You have to let your fears of the Lodge go. I\u0027ll admit, though, the Lodge turned me around often enough. Several times I was so lost I had to call for help. Which brings me to why I was looking for you. Have you seen Logan this morning?\" \"Logan? No. Why?\" \"I think he\u0027s run away. We had a disagreement the other day. Logan seems to think his work hours are too demanding. He was gone from his room this morning, when I went in to wake him up.\" \"Good riddance,\" Rix said curtly. \"Logan could never take your place. You should realize that by now.\" \"I honestly thought Logan had the potential to do something with his life. Cass told me I was being foolish; maybe she was right.\" He scowled, an expression Rix was unused to seeing on Edwin\u0027s placid features. \"Logan has no discipline. I should\u0027ve known that, after Robert told me about all the scrapes he\u0027s been in. Well . . . I wanted to give him a chance, because he\u0027s a Bodane. Was that so wrong?\" \"Not wrong. Maybe just too trusting.\" \"That\u0027s exactly what Cass says. I\u0027m not going to call Robert yet; I\u0027ll give Logan the rest of the day. But if Logan can\u0027t do it, who\u0027s going to take my place?\" He massaged the knuckles of one hand. \"The boy needs a good whipping to straighten him out.\" \"He\u0027s long past that,\" Rix said. Edwin grunted. \"I haven\u0027t gone over to the Lodge yet. If Logan went in there alone after I told him not to, he\u0027s as stupid as he is disobedient. Well, I won\u0027t bother you with Logan. Unfortunately, he\u0027s my problem.\" He started across the library to the door. \"Edwin?\" Rix said, and the other man stopped. Rix motioned toward the cardboard boxes. \"I\u0027ve been going through those to find out how Ludlow Usher got the ebony cane back into the family. I know it was stolen away by the man who killed Aram Usher in a duel, and it was gone for at least thirteen years. Obviously the cane is very important. Do you have any idea how Ludlow might\u0027ve retrieved it? Any stories you might\u0027ve heard from your father or mother?\" \"No,\" Edwin replied - but he\u0027d said it too quickly, and at once Rix\u0027s interest perked up. \"I\u0027d better see if I can track down - \" Rix planted himself between Edwin and the door. \"If you know anything at all, I want you to tell me. Who\u0027s it going to hurt? Not Mom, and certainly not Dad. Not you or Cass, either.\" He saw the indecision on Edwin\u0027s face. \"Come on. Please, I need to hear what you know.\" \"Rix, I don\u0027t - \" \"It\u0027s important to me. I have to know.\" Outside the library, thunder echoed like a bass kettledrum. Edwin said in a resigned voice, \"All right. I do know how Ludlow found the cane. When I was about Logan\u0027s age, I was just like him; I hated to work. I found a good hiding place - the library in the Lodge\u0027s basement.\" He smiled vaguely. \"I used to steal cigars from the drawing room and smoke them down there. It\u0027s a wonder I didn\u0027t set fire to the house, with all those books and journals around. Naturally, I read a great deal, too.\" \"And you found something about Ludlow and the cane?\" Rix prompted. \"Among other things. It was in a volume of old newspaper clippings. Of course, that was a long time ago. I\u0027m not sure my memory is very reliable anymore.\" \"Tell me what you remember. Anything.\" Edwin still looked uncertain. He started to protest again, but then he sighed and slowly eased himself into a chair. \"All right,\" he said finally, watching a candelabra burn on a table near him. \"I know that Luther Bodane, my grandfather, went with Ludlow to New Orleans in the summer of 1882. Ludlow wanted to see his half sister, Shann. She was in a convent outside the city, and had been there for more than eight years.\" \"Shann was a nun?\" Rix asked. \"I thought she was a concert pianist. Didn\u0027t she study music in Paris?\" \"She did. Obviously she was a musical prodigy, because she was composing when she was ten years old. As I understand it, Shann was in Paris when her father was killed. His death must have been a terrible shock to her; she was a shy, gentle girl who idolized Aram Usher. But she finished her education. Her final examination at the academy was an original concerto, which she played for the headmistress.\" Edwin\u0027s eyes seemed to darken as he saw beyond Rix and into the past. \"The concerto was written in honor of her father. Shann graduated with high marks. When she returned to America, she immediately started a concert tour.\" \"So how did she become a nun?\" \"The academy\u0027s headmistress hanged herself after Shann left,\" Edwin continued, as if he hadn\u0027t heard Rix\u0027s question. \"On her tour, Shann played what came to be known as the Usher Concerto. There are dozens of clippings in the Lodge\u0027s library praising her performances. The tour continued for more than four months, and everywhere Shann played she was a phenomenal success. Then the suicides began.\" \"Suicides? I don\u0027t understand.\" \"Neither did anyone else, at first. A dozen people in New York City, ten in Boston, eight in Philadelphia, another dozen in Charleston. And all of them had heard the Usher Concerto.\" Rix recoiled inwardly. He remembered the faded photograph of the little girl sitting happily at her white grand piano. \"You mean . . . the music had something to do with their suicides?\" \"Evidently so.\" Edwin\u0027s voice had taken on a grim tone. \"The music was so . . . beautifully strange that it worked on the imagination long after it was heard. The press began to put everything together. When Shann stepped off the train in New Orleans with her entourage, the newspapermen were waiting for her like a pack of hounds. There was a mob outside the station; they called her a murderess, shouted that she was a witch who\u0027d discovered some sort of satanic symphony. The stress was too much for Shann, and she collapsed in the terminal. For the next several years, she lived in a New Orleans sanitarium. She joined the convent after she was released.\" \"And she never came back to Usherland? Isn\u0027t she buried in the cemetery.\" \"No. The monument was erected to her memory, but Shann was buried in New Orleans. It\u0027s unclear exactly why Ludlow went to see her; possibly he was trying to bring her back home. In any case, she wouldn\u0027t leave the convent.\" Edwin hesitated, arranging his thoughts. His shadow was scrawled on the wall behind him. \"There\u0027d been heavy thunderstorms and flooding in New Orleans, and the trains had been canceled,\" he continued quietly. \"Ludlow and Luther booked passage on one of the last of the old Cordweiler steamboats, the Bayou Moon. According to the newspaper accounts, the boat was in decrepit condition. Anyway, somehow Ludlow let himself be lured into a backroom poker game - and that\u0027s the beginning of how he retrieved the family scepter . . .\" As Edwin spoke, the muffled boom of approaching thunder rang out over Usherland. In his imagination, Rix saw the once proud Bayou Moon, now an unsightly patchwork of cheap timbers, plowing northward along the swollen Mississippi. A high-stakes card game was in progress in a lamplit room, and twenty-four-year-old Ludlow Usher sat down at the round table for what was to become much more than a game. Mr. Tyson - the top-hatted older gentleman who had struck up a conversation with Ludlow at the bar - introduced him to the other three players. Ludlow had given his name as \"Tom Wyatt,\" aware that the older gentleman was probably looking for a sheep to fleece. The Usher name might be known to him, and this was a precaution Ludlow often took with strangers. Ludlow nodded toward each of them in turn: a heavyset, bald-headed man who wore flashy diamond rings and gave his name as \"Nicholls, with two l\u0027s\"; a coffee-colored man named Chance, who wore a gray goatee and had a brown velvet eyepatch over his right eye that matched the color and cloth of his suit; and a lean Negro who called himself Brethren and wore a ruby stickpin through one flared nostril. A glass of whiskey was poured for Ludlow, a fine Havana cigar was offered to him, and the game of five-card draw was under way. The Bayou Moon rocked and heaved over rough water, its timbers groaning as if about to split apart. Fifty- and hundred-dollar bills littered the card table, and the oil lamps arranged around the room glowed through shifting layers of blue cigar smoke. Ludlow expected to lose his money quickly and return to the bar for the rest of the long trip to St. Louis - and so he was surprised when, less than an hour later, he\u0027d won almost five thousand dollars. Tyson poured him another whiskey and complimented him on his shrewd handling of the cards. Ludlow had done nothing particularly shrewd; in fact, most of his winnings had come when the other players folded. Nicholls, with the practiced delivery of an ex-thespian, suddenly offered the suggestion that all bets should be doubled. \"It\u0027s doom on my own fool head, I know,\" he said with a thin smile, \"but perhaps this young man\u0027s luck will change.\" \"I\u0027m not so sure, Mr. Nicholls,\" Tyson replied. \"Our Mr. Wyatt has a canny look about him. What say, Mr. Wyatt? Are you agreeable?\" Ludlow knew he should take the money and run. All eyes were on him. There was a moment of strained silence. Ludlow decided to play it out. \"I\u0027m agreeable,\" he said. To his amusement, he continued to win with no apparent effort. Ludlow\u0027s quick, retentive mind was calculating the odds on each hand; it took no genius to realize he was being primed for disaster. It began slowly, as Brethren won a thousand-dollar pot that was mostly Ludlow\u0027s money. Then Ludlow was only winning one hand out of four, and his stack of chips was dwindling fast. Still, just when it appeared that Ludlow might fold and rise from the table, he was allowed to win a substantial pot. They were toying with him, he knew, and had to be all in it together for such clockwork precision. Perhaps Tyson had chosen him as a mark because of his well-cut clothing, or his diamond stickpin, or the wad of cash with which he\u0027d paid his bar bill. Though their faces were innocently concerned with their own cards, the men seemed to know exactly what Ludlow held, and bet accordingly. Ludlow was puzzled; how were they doing it? He stopped drinking the whiskeys that Tyson pressed on him, and concentrated with a vengeance on the cards. Ludlow was down to his last thousand dollars of winnings when his ringers touched three tiny raised dots in the lower left corner of the king of spades. The other cards he held also had a combination of dots in the same place; they would not be perceived, Ludlow realized, by a drunken man who was convinced the tide of luck would again return in his favor. The cards were marked in what seemed to be random patterns of faint dots - an intricate code that told the dealer exactly what cards each man held. Ludlow smiled inwardly at the double challenge that faced him: to decipher that code, and to gain control of the deck. \"Well,\" he said, adding a slur to his voice as he lost another four hundred dollars, \"I think that\u0027ll be all for me, gentlemen.\" He started to rise. Tyson clasped his arm. \"One more hand, Mr. Wyatt. I sense you\u0027re a very lucky man today.\" Ludlow won the next hand, and the one after that as well. Then his losing streak started in earnest. His winnings were gone, and he was playing with Usher money. Control of the deck circulated around the table, with Chance\u0027s chips on the rise. For the next hour, as the Bayou Moon fought the river currents and rain thrashed down in torrents, the mind behind Ludlow\u0027s mask worked like a machine. He calculated odds like a master mathematician, his fingers playing over the series of dots, entering each combination and the card it signified into memory. He began to fold more regularly, to conserve his money, and subsequently - with a quick glance from Chance to Tyson that Ludlow caught from the corner of his eye - his \"luck\" returned with a heavy pot, encouraging him to bet recklessly the next round. As long as he could deal, Ludlow knew, he would stand a better chance of beating them at their own game. But they had more experience than he, and he would still have to play the bewildered fool - until the time was right to destroy them. He focused all his concentration on the cards he dealt, letting the marked corner slide against his finger, but he was clumsy at it and only recognized half of the cards. He had to wait six more hands before he got the deal again. This time, he did it more slowly, deliberately. Though he lost to Brethren, Ludlow\u0027s percentage of correct calls went up considerably. When he dealt the next time, Ludlow was down seven thousand dollars of his own money. There was blood in the eyes of the other men; they smelled fresh meat, and were pressing forward for the kill. And now it was time. \"Gentlemen,\" Ludlow said, as he cut and shuffled the deck, \"I feel lucky. What say we up the ante?\" A slick smile spread over Tyson\u0027s face. \"Another thousand dollars apiece, Mr. Wyatt?\" \"No sir,\" Ludlow replied. \"Another ten thousand dollars apiece. In cash.\" In the sudden silence he put the deck carefully down in front of him and peeled off the bills from the roll in his coat. He laid the money out in the middle of the table. \"That\u0027s . . . a hell of a sum of money,\" Nicholls said, his eyes dancing around at the other men. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Ludlow feigned stupid surprise. \"Aren\u0027t you gentlemen up to it?\" \"Ten thousand dollars as ante for one hand?\" Brethren took the cigar from his mouth, his black eyes slitting. \"What\u0027s the limit?\" \"The sky,\" Ludlow said. \"Is anyone willing to play?\" The silence stretched. Tyson cleared his throat nervously and slugged down a shot of whiskey. Across the table from Ludlow, Chance stared fixedly at him, smiling coldly. \"I\u0027ll play,\" Chance said. He brought a wad of bills from his own brown velvet jacket, counted out ten thousand dollars and tossed the money to cover Ludlow\u0027s. Brethren said, \"I\u0027m out, men.\" Nicholls sputtered with indecision, then added his money to the pot. Tyson paused; his eyes had turned reptilian, and studied Ludlow\u0027s face. Then he grunted softly and came up with ten thousand dollars. Now Ludlow had to be both careful and precise. He dealt slowly, sliding the dots against his finger, identifying each card before he dealt the next. When the cards were out and the draw had been dealt, Ludlow had a pair of tens, the queen of hearts, the five of diamonds, and the five of hearts. By his calculations, Tyson had two aces, Nicholls a mixed hand, and Chance held two pair, jacks and nines. \"Bets?\" Ludlow asked softly. Tyson opened with a thousand dollars. Nicholls met it, and so did Chance. \"I\u0027ll see your thousand,\" Ludlow told them, \"and raise you another ten thousand.\" He peeled the bills off and flung them to the table. A soft cough of cheroot smoke left Nicholls\u0027s mouth. Tyson\u0027s face had begun to take on a yellowish cast; he picked up his cards and stared at them as if trying to read the future. Ludlow met Chance\u0027s gaze across the table, their faces revealing nothing. \"Well?\" Ludlow asked silkily. \"A gambler who runs away,\" Tyson said as he laid his cards on the table, \"will live to win another day. Sorry, gents.\" Nicholls had a bead of sweat on his nose. With a resigned moan, he pushed away his worthless hand. \"You think you\u0027ve got me, don\u0027t you?\" Chance\u0027s single eye was the color of a murky topaz. \"No sir, I don\u0027t believe you do.\" He began to count off the bills - but after eight thousand three hundred dollars, his luck had run out. \"You\u0027re short, sir,\" Ludlow said. \"I think that finishes you.\" He started to rake the money toward him. But Chance\u0027s hand shot forward, the fingers clamping around Ludlow\u0027s wrist. The gambler\u0027s eye was blazing, a bitter twist to his mouth. \"I have something,\" Chance said tersely, \"that I think may make up the difference.\" He reached down to the floor beside his chair - and placed upon the table an object that bleached the blood from Ludlow\u0027s face. It was the lion-headed Usher scepter. \"A beauty, isn\u0027t it?\" Chance asked. \"It used to belong to a rich man. Look at the workmanship in that silver lion\u0027s-head. Look at the ebony, as smooth as glass. It was given to me by that rich man\u0027s wife. She and I were, shall we say, well acquainted?\" Ludlow looked into Chance\u0027s face and realized he\u0027d been playing cards with the man who\u0027d killed his father. His heart had begun pounding, the blood rushing into his face again. \"What . . . makes you believe that stick is worth seventeen hundred dollars, sir?\" \"Because it\u0027s magic,\" Chance said, leaning toward Ludlow with a conspiratorial smile. \"You see this patch, Mr. Wyatt? I was shot in the face in Atlanta six years ago. Point-blank, with a derringer. I lost my eye, but I lived because I had that cane in my hand. Two years ago, a man on a train stabbed me in the stomach. The knife went deep . . . but the wound was healed in a week. A woman cut me in the neck with a broken bottle in Kansas City. The doctor said I should\u0027ve bled to death, but I didn\u0027t. I had that cane in my hand. It\u0027s magic, and that\u0027s why it\u0027s worth seventeen hundred dollars and a lot more.\" Ludlow picked the cane up and examined the lion\u0027s-head. His hands were shaking. \"It\u0027s full of luck,\" Chance told him. \"Look at me. I\u0027m walking proof.\" And Ludlow said in a choked voice, \"Your luck . . . has just run its course, Mr. Tigre.\" Chance - Randolph Tigre - looked as stunned as if he\u0027d been kicked in the head by a horse. \"My name is Ludlow Usher. You murdered my father, Aram Usher. I think the police would like to - \" And then Tigre leaped violently to his feet with a shouted curse, throwing the table over onto Ludlow. Cards, money, and chips flew through the air. Nicholls squalled like a scalded cat, and Tyson fell over in his chair. As Ludlow toppled backward with the cane in his grasp, Tigre was already drawing an Usher \"Gentlemen\u0027s Defender\" revolver from a holster under his coat. \"No!\" Brethren shouted, grabbing for the other man\u0027s arm. The gun went off, blasting one of the lamps to smithereens. Burning oil splattered across the floor and wall. The second shot blew the side of Tyson\u0027s head off as he was staggering to his feet. Then Tigre shoved Brethren aside and fired twice through the upturned table. One bullet snagged Ludlow\u0027s sleeve, and the second caught the edge of his left ear like a burning whip. \"Murder!\" Nicholls shouted. \"Help!\" Tigre fled for the door, burst through it and into the narrow passageway. Ludlow went after him, revenge fiery in his veins. As he came through the door and onto the promenade deck, he found Tigre standing at the rail six feet away. With an animalish growl, Tigre brought the pistol up to fire into Ludlow\u0027s face. But Ludlow was faster with the cane. He struck the other man\u0027s arm, upsetting his aim, and the bullet blazed over his shoulder. Then Ludlow barreled headlong into him; they smashed together and there was a sharp cracking sound as the rail broke. Clinging to each other, Ludlow and Tigre fell over the side into the churning river. Underwater, Tigre hammered at Ludlow with the pistol. They turned over and over, blinded by mud, wrenched by tremendous currents. Ludlow\u0027s back slammed against something hard. A pounding, roaring noise filled his head - and he realized they\u0027d been pulled underneath the Bayou Moon. The boat\u0027s hull was over their heads, the grinding paddlewheel dangerously close. His flailing fist struck Tigre\u0027s body. He grasped the man\u0027s coat, but a booted foot kicked him in the stomach and precious air exploded from Ludlow\u0027s mouth. Tigre wrenched free, desperately swimming away. A fierce downward current caught Ludlow, and in the next instant he was caught in the branches of an underwater tree less than ten feet below the surface. He struggled to free himself, the last of his air burning in his lungs. Tigre was caught in a current that hurled him toward the surface. His head slammed against wood, and then he gasped for breath. His relief turned rapidly to terror. The river boiled around him, and he was being lifted out of the water by his neck. His head was caught between the spokes of the paddlewheel. As it brought him up from the river, Tigre screamed with the pressure on his head and neck. His scream became strangled, and the knot of people who watched in horror saw Randolph Tigre\u0027s body writhe as his neck snapped. As if on a hideous revolving gallows, Tigre was borne up by the paddlewheel and then down into the water - and up again, lifeless and covered with mud. And in the paddlewheel\u0027s wake, a tree that had been weighted down with mud rose suddenly from the bottom of the river. From its upper branches dangled Ludlow Usher, half-drowned and battered - but clutching in his hand his father\u0027s cane. Rix was staring up at the brooding portrait of Ludlow. \"Randolph Tigre believed the cane protected him from death?\" he asked softly. \"At least that\u0027s the story Nicholls gave the reporter. Of course, he might\u0027ve said anything to get off the hook.\" \"I remember . . . Mom said something a couple of days ago about Dad being thrown from a horse and falling on his head.\" Rix turned toward Edwin. \"She said he got up and brushed himself off, and he was just fine. As far as I know, Dad\u0027s never really been seriously injured.\" Edwin raised his eyebrows. \"Are you saying the cane had something to do with that?\" \"I don\u0027t know. But if Tigre could survive all those injuries while he was in possession of the cane - \" \"You\u0027re thinking like a fiction writer,\" Edwin said. \"It\u0027s just a cane, not a magic wand. I repeated the story as I recalled it from a newspaper article - and I think it goes without saying that the newspapers in those days exaggerated wildly.\" Rix stared for a silent moment at Edwin. \"What if it is magic?\" he asked. \"A good-luck charm or something? That\u0027s why it protected Tigre until Ludlow got it back. And that\u0027s why every Usher has kept it so close to him. Look at those portraits.\" He motioned with a sweep of his hand. \"The cane\u0027s within reach in every picture.\" Edwin nodded. \"I know that. But the cane\u0027s a symbol of power, too. It would naturally be in all the pictures, and naturally the Usher patriarch would always have it close at hand.\" The thunder sounded nearer, and Edwin flinched slightly. \"The storm\u0027s building. I expect we\u0027ll have a downpour before long.\" He rose from his seat. \"I was reluctant to tell you that story because of what I knew about Shann and the Usher Concerto. That\u0027s not something that would reflect very well on your family.\" Rix walked beneath the portraits, noting where the cane was positioned in each one. \"There\u0027s something more to that cane than a symbol of authority, Edwin,\" he said firmly. He recalled the almost overwhelming sense of power he\u0027d felt course through him when he held it. Had the men in those portraits experienced the same feeling? Looking at Aram\u0027s picture, he was struck by a new thought. Had Aram realized he was going to die on the day of that duel because he no longer had the cane? And had he used that realization against Tigre by simply failing to load his pistol? \"Well, I\u0027ve got to find Logan. If you see him, please tell him to report to Cass or me.\" Edwin paused at the door. \"And make sure you eat lunch, Rix. There\u0027s no sense in weakening yourself.\" \"I will,\" Rix said, and Edwin left the library. Now he had the information that Wheeler Dunstan wanted. Perhaps, also, Dunstan could shed some light on the notebook containing the sketches and math formulas. Carrying the notebook, Rix went out of the library. He was crossing the smoking room when a violent clap of thunder crashed over Usherland. The delicate mechanism of the ornate grandfather clock, which no longer chimed the hours due to Walen\u0027s condition, let out a soft, musical tinkle. Rix glanced at the brass pendulum - and stopped immediately. Realization clicked into place in his mind like the tumblers of a lock. He opened the book to the sketches and compared them with the long pendulum rod, with its half-moon decoration at the bottom. The sketches were of pendulums with varying shapes of pendulum bobs. Pendulum, he thought. Walen\u0027s secret project. But this book obviously predated Walen. Whose was it? And what did it mean? As he stood looking from the book to the grandfather clock, he imagined he felt the floor shiver - for just a fleeting second - under his feet. A wall groaned softly, and then was silent. He waited, his heartbeat picking up, for another vibration, but none followed. He had a lot of questions to ask Wheeler Dunstan, and he hurried up to his room to get the newspaper account of Cynthia Usher\u0027s death. And this time, Rix vowed, he intended to see the manuscript of Time Will Tell the Tale - one way or another.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/usher-s-passing/page-38.html","bookId":2474,"book":{"id":2474,"title":"Usher\u0027s Passing","description":"Storyline: In this most gothic of Robert McCammon\u0027s novels, setting is key: the continuing saga of the Usher family (descended from the brother of Roderick and Madeline of Edgar Poe\u0027s \"Fall of the House of Usher\") takes place in the weird and picturesque heart of the North Carolina mountains. The haughty, aristocratic Ushers live in a mansion near Asheville; the poor but crafty mountain folk (whose families are just as ancient) live on Briartop Mountain nearby. At harvest time, when the book\u0027s action unfolds, the mountains are a blaze of color. Add to the mixture a sinister history of mountain kids disappearing every year, a journalist investigating those disappearances, a monster called \"The Pumpkin Man,\" moldy books and paintings in a huge old library at the Usher estate, and a secret chamber with a strange device involving a brass pendulum and tuning forks--and you\u0027ve got a splendid recipe for atmospheric horror.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/usher-s-passing.jpg","author":"Robert McCammon","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/usher-s-passing.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 4:46:55 PM"}}
