{"id":82760,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"Robert McCammon Tells How He\\n\\n Wrote Baal\\n\\n Baal is my Angry Young Man novel. It was also my first published novel, and the first book I ever tried to write. I think that in Baal you can feel the friction of shoulders being squeezed by iron walls: my shoulders, pressing against the walls of a dead-end job.\\n\\n You see, I never thought I could be a writer. Write? For money? Like... really say something? That was someone else\u0027s dream. I went to the University of Alabama and majored in journalism, because that\u0027s what I figured writers did. As a kid, I played around with a typewriter, and I did ghost stories, mysteries, westerns, science fiction... but those were creations to entertain myself. I was a shy kid, gawky, not very good at sports. You know the type - they never go out of style. Somewhere there\u0027s a heaven where revenge is exacted, and all those jocks who burned bright and handsome now have beer guts and have to wait to be... the... very... last... one... chosen.\\n\\n So maybe I\u0027m still a little angry after all.\\n\\n Baal is about power, written at a time when I had none. I was twenty-five years old when I wrote Baal, and working at a department store in my hometown of Birmingham, Alabama. My job was ferrying advertising proofs between the local newspaper and the various department heads: \"traffic control,\" they called it. When I went home at night, I sat down at my old Royal typewriter - long since deceased - and worked on the novel that would become Baal.\\n\\n People often ask me where I get my ideas for characters. I always say that each character, whether male or female, is put together from observation, memory, and is part of the author too. I really believe there\u0027s part of me in all my characters - and not only the good ones. The character of Baal - with his unleashed wild power and his ability to do just about anything he pleases - is certainly part of what I was feeling at that time in my life. I was an electric plug, and I couldn\u0027t seem to find the right socket, until I began writing.\\n\\n One character in Baal particularly stands out to me, and that\u0027s the elderly and very innocent Virga. I used to have lunch at the same place every day, a restaurant called the Molton Grill that\u0027s no longer in Birmingham, and an elderly Catholic priest would come in almost every day as well. He had his favorite table, he always seemed to order the same thing, and he ate alone. I watched the man, and I created the character of Virga in his image. I never knew the priest\u0027s name, but I have his face in my mind. And maybe some of his spirit in Virga.\\n\\n You always hear this said to young writers: \"Write what you know.\" I wanted to write about things I didn\u0027t know, so I consciously set Baal in locations as far from the South as possible: Boston, the Middle East, and Greenland. I wanted a global scale and a story that would take the reader to the very edge of Armageddon, and I hope I succeeded.\\n\\n As I said, Baal was my first novel. My first step into the unknown. Whatever I am today, and wherever I\u0027m going, Baal started me on the path. Ten years since Baal was first published, I\u0027m still on the journey.\\n\\n Robert McCammon\\n\\n June 1988 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/baal/page-30.html","bookId":2473,"book":{"id":2473,"title":"Baal","description":"Storyline: He is the foul seed of evil the dark prophet who sees what is - and creates what will always be.
