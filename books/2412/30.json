{"id":75280,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"Phoebe was minutes from the jewelry store when the alarm went off. She stood within sight of it, with the crisis team already moving men and equipment into positions when the nine-one-one call was relayed to her.\\n\\n This is Mark D, and I have an emergency. There is an armed man holding me and sixteen other hostages inside my store. He has guns and explosives. He says if he doesn\u0027t receive a call from Lieutenant Phoebe MacNamara within five minutes from the end of this call, he will shoot one of the hostages. For every minute beyond that five-minute deadline, he will shoot another. If anyone other than Lieutenant MacNamara attempts to contact him on this phone, or any other, he will shoot a hostage. If there is any attempt to enter this building, he will detonate the explosives. Lieutenant MacNamara has exactly five minutes from now.\\n\\n She reached for her cell phone. \"Give me the number inside.\"\\n\\n \"Communications is nearly set up,\" Harrison told her.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want him to know that, or that I\u0027m already here. The less he thinks we know, the longer we can stall.\" She punched in the number passed to her, sucked in a breath, then punched to call.\\n\\n \"This better be Phoebe.\"\\n\\n Answered first ring, she noted, and scribbled down eager/anxious to get started. \"It\u0027s Phoebe, Jerry. I\u0027m told you want to talk to me.\"\\n\\n \"You and nobody else. Anyone else calls in here, somebody dies. That\u0027s the first term.\"\\n\\n \"No one else calls you, talks to you, but me. I understand. Will you tell me how everyone\u0027s doing in there?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. Scared spitless. Got us some criers. One guy\u0027s going to have a hell of a headache when he comes to. If he comes to. Hey, I think you know him, Phoebe. Arnie Meeks? You\u0027ve danced with him before, right?\"\\n\\n Her rapidly scribbling hand jumped. \"Are you saying that Arnold Meeks is one of the hostages, and that he\u0027s injured?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m saying. He\u0027s also wearing an accessory. Just like the one I made for Roy. You remember Roy.\"\\n\\n Not someone she loved this time, she thought, but someone she detested. And a damn clever, vicious way to up the stakes. \"Are you telling me that you\u0027ve rigged explosives on Arnold Meeks\u0027s person?\"\\n\\n \"Oh yeah. A whole shitload of them. Any move on the building, and I blow him and a hell of a lot of others to hell. I don\u0027t figure you\u0027ll mind much about old Arnie, right? Guy messed you up, didn\u0027t he? Coward\u0027s way. How about if I pay him back for you?\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t sound as if you want to do me any favors, Jerry. Can we talk about you and me, and what you do want?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re just getting started. You\u0027d better get things set up fast, Phoebe. I\u0027ve got a little work to do in here. You call me back in ten.\"\\n\\n \"Get the com up,\" Phoebe snapped. \"Commander, I need Mike Vince here, right here.\"\\n\\n \"Done.\" He ordered it. \"We\u0027ve got a partial visual, a count often hostages on the floor. We can\u0027t confirm if there are seven more. Internal security has locked down the building. There\u0027s a device rigged to the rear door with trip wires.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t try to defuse, please. He\u0027d know. It would give him the ex cuse to kill a hostage, or set off the rig he has on Meeks. What he wants most is to play me, to pay me back. We need to let him do that, as long as we can.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d left a tidy house, she thought, and roses for Angela. \"Commander, he\u0027s not planning on coming out of there alive. It\u0027s a suicide mission for him, his sacrifice. And his way of paying me back. The loss of seventeen hostages, including a man who injured me. I know what he\u0027s doing. I need time to wind this out.\"\\n\\n \"Corn\u0027s set-negotiation control\u0027s in that ladies\u0027 boutique up there.\" Sykes gestured.\\n\\n \"Okay, I need everything, every scrap we have on him, everything we know or think we know. I need Mike Vince sent up as soon as possible. I need you with me, Sykes. I talk. Nobody talks to him but me.\" she continued as they hurried toward the boutique. \"I need you to feed me information, to let me know if I go off on the wrong angle. He wants to play this out, too, so he won\u0027t rush it if we don\u0027t rush him. You help me interpret, help me listen, help me with every goddamn thing. Because he knows how this works, and he\u0027s waiting for me to make a mistake. He\u0027s salivating for just that.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s got nothing to lose, Lieutenant.\"\\n\\n \"No, he\u0027s already lost. What he wants is for me to sweat, then blow the whole thing-including himself-to pieces. This isn\u0027t a negotiation. But the longer he believes I think it is, the longer we have to get everyone out alive.\"\\n\\n \"You think he knew Arnie was security there?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" She stepped into the boutique where her base had been set up amid thin summer dresses, pretty accessories, high-end handbags and fashionable sandals.\\n\\n \"I think it must have thrilled him to find out Arnie was on the door there. I think he saw it as a sign that he\u0027d chosen his last stand perfectly.\" She stripped off her blazer, tossed it aside. \"We already know why he\u0027s in there, what he wants. But we play it out. Start the checklist.\"\\n\\n She sat at a table cleared of stock, pressed her fingers to her eyes. \"He\u0027s cold, rational, committed. He\u0027s suicidal. He wants to die. This is another kind of suicide by cop-but a specific cop. Me. I fail, everyone dies. My failure\u0027s his motive, but that doesn\u0027t go for him unless we establish negotiations, unless we talk, play the game.\"\\n\\n She checked her watch. Ten minutes exactly, she told herself. If she called a minute before, a minute after, he could use it as an excuse. She ordered herself to clear her head, to find the calm. When Liz came through the door, Phoebe was counting down the last two minutes. \"Your guy Duncan\u0027s just outside the perimeter, with his lawyer, Phineas Hector. He says he has to talk to you, right now. It\u0027s urgent.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t-\"\\n\\n \"Phoebe, he says he\u0027s got two people inside. He says he knows two of the hostages.\"\\n\\n \"Pull him in, fast.\"\\n\\n One minute, fifteen seconds, she noted when Duncan and Phin came in.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s got my mother in there,\" Phin blurted out. \"He\u0027s got my wife and mother in there.\"\\n\\n It was like a bare-fisted blow to the throat. \"Are you sure?\"\\n\\n \"They were going to meet me there.\" The fight for control was obvious on his face as Duncan stood shoulder to shoulder with Phin. \"I talked to Loo on her cell a few minutes before twelve because I was running late. They were inside. They were waiting for me. Jesus, Phoebe-\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re not hurt. He hasn\u0027t hurt anyone but the security guard.\"\\n\\n But her hands had gone clammy. \"They\u0027re smart, sensible women, and they won\u0027t do anything to get themselves hurt.\"\\n\\n \"If he knows who they are...\" Duncan began.\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t. He couldn\u0027t know they\u0027d be in there. He isn\u0027t looking at them. It isn\u0027t about them. I need you both to go stand back there. Don\u0027t say anything, don\u0027t do anything. He doesn\u0027t know who they are, my connection to them, and that\u0027s vital to keeping them safe. I have to call him back. He can\u0027t hear anything but me now.\"\\n\\n She signaled as Mike Vince came in. \"I\u0027m not asking you to go outside. I\u0027m trusting you to let me do my job. You trust me to do it. Sykes,\\n\\n ADA Louise Hector and her mother-in-law, Beatrice Hector, are inside. I\u0027m calling him back,\" she said to Vince. \"I want you to listen. You have anything, anything at all to add, to help, any question, you write it down. Don\u0027t speak. I don\u0027t want him to hear your voice.\"\\n\\n \"Christ, Lieutenant, Christ, I can\u0027t believe Jerry would do something like this.\"\\n\\n \"Believe it.\" She shoved a pad and pencil at him, then made the call. \"Right on time.\"\\n\\n \"What can I do for you now, Jerry?\"\\n\\n \"How about a car, and a plane waiting for me at the airport.\"\\n\\n \"Is that what you want, Jerry?\" She read the note Sykes put in front of her. \"A car, a plane?\"\\n\\n Fifteen hostages, cuffed together in a circle. Explosive device in the center of the circle.\\n\\n \"And if I did?\"\\n\\n \"You know I\u0027d try to get it for you. Might be able to swing the car. What kind of car would you like, Jerry?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been looking at those Chrysler Crossfires. Gotta love the name, and I buy American.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d like a Chrysler Crossfire.\"\\n\\n \"Might. Loaded.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try to get that for you, Jerry. But you know that you\u0027d have to give me something for it. We both know the way this works.\"\\n\\n \"Fuck the way it works. What do you want for the car?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d have to ask if you\u0027d release some hostages. Anyone with a medical condition to start, or children. Jerry, will you tell me if there are any children in there?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t do kids. If I were going to do a kid, I\u0027d\u0027ve done yours. Had plenty of opportunities the last couple years.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you for not hurting my daughter,\" she said as her blood ran cold. \"Jerry, are you willing to release some hostages if I can get you the car you want?\"\\n\\n \"Hell no.\" He laughed himself breathless.\\n\\n \"What are you willing to give if I can get you the car you want?\"\\n\\n \"Not a fucking thing. I don\u0027t want any goddamn car.\"\\n\\n She curled her hand around a bottle of water someone had set in front of her, but didn\u0027t drink. \"You\u0027re saying you don\u0027t want a car, at this time?\"\\n\\n \"Could\u0027ve put a pipe bomb in yours. Thought about it.\"\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Then we wouldn\u0027t be talking right now, would we, you stupid bitch.\"\\n\\n Mood swings. Conversational tone, then adversarial. Drug use?\\n\\n \"I understand you want to talk to me. So tell me, Jerry, what can I do to help resolve this situation?\"\\n\\n \"You can pull out your piece, stick the barrel in your mouth and pull the trigger. How about doing that? I\u0027ll let all the female hostages go if you blow the back of your head off while I\u0027m on the line. I want to hear it.\"\\n\\n \"If I did that, we couldn\u0027t talk anymore. You told me you wouldn\u0027t talk to anyone but me. If anyone else tried to talk to you, you\u0027d kill someone. Do you want to talk to someone else, Jerry, or to me?\"\\n\\n \"You think you\u0027re going to build a rapport with me?\"\\n\\n \"I think you have things to say to me. I\u0027m here to listen to you.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t give a fuck about me. You didn\u0027t give a fuck about her.\"\\n\\n \"I understand that you blame me for what happened to Angela.\"\\n\\n \"You let her die, same thing as killing her. She bled to death while you fucked around with the men who put the bullet in her. I had the shot. In the first hour I had the kill shot, but didn\u0027t get the green.\"\\n\\n Lies. Probably believes he had the shot now. Needs to believe he could\u0027ve saved her.\\n\\n \"None of us knew she\u0027d been so seriously hurt, Jerry. They lied to us, to all of us. None of us knew Angela was hurt at all in that first hour.\"\\n\\n \"You should\u0027ve known!\"\\n\\n Fury. Grief. \"You\u0027re right, Jerry, I should\u0027ve known. I should\u0027ve known they were lying.\" She read the next communique that came in with a runner. \"I understand you loved her, and she loved you.\"\\n\\n \"You understand nothing. \"\\n\\n Agree with him, Mike Vince scribbled on his pad. Don\u0027t say you understand or you know. Only make him madder.\\n\\n \"How could I, really? You\u0027re right. How could I understand that sort of bond? Most people only dream of having that. But I do understand that you were going to be together. You should\u0027ve been together,\\n\\n Jerry. You should\u0027ve been able to run away together and be happy.\"\\n\\n \"The fuck you care.\"\\n\\n His voice was calmer, and she nodded at Vince. \"I guess, well, I guess I\u0027ve dreamed of having what you and Angela had. You know things weren\u0027t good for me and Roy. He never loved me the way I think you loved Angela.\"\\n\\n \"She was my goddamn life. If I\u0027d taken that shot, we\u0027d both still have a life. You saved the men who murdered her, but you didn\u0027t save her.\"\\n\\n \"I failed her. I failed you. You want to hurt me, I understand that, I understand why. But how does what you\u0027re doing now balance the scales?\"\\n\\n \"They can\u0027t be balanced, you fucking cunt. Maybe I\u0027ll shoot this asshole Arnie between the eyes. Does that balance the scales for you?\"\\n\\n She picked up the water now, but only to rub the cold bottle over her forehead. \"Killing him isn\u0027t going to hurt me, Jerry.\"\\n\\n \"I want you to beg me not to, like you did with Roy. Hear that!\\n\\n Hear that?\" he shouted as someone screamed. \"I\u0027ve got my gun pressed dead center of his forehead. You beg me not to pull the trigger.\"\\n\\n \"Why would I, Jerry, after what he did to me? After I thought about doing it myself if I could.\"\\n\\n \"You know what they\u0027ll say about you if I do it?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. They\u0027ll say maybe I didn\u0027t try hard enough, maybe I didn\u0027t put myself into this because, underneath, I wanted him to die. I wanted him to die hard. But you know, Jerry, I don\u0027t care what they say about me. You pull the trigger, he\u0027s gone, and it changes the situation out here. It takes a lot of the weight off me. You know how it works. You do a hostage, Tactical steps it up. So you want to pull the trigger? I don\u0027t lose a thing. Is that what you want, Jerry?\"\\n\\n \"Wait and see.\"\\n\\n He cut off the line, and Phoebe dropped her head in her hands. \"Jesus, Lieutenant,\" Vince managed. \"You gave him permission to kill a hostage.\"\\n\\n \"Which is why he won\u0027t.\" Please God, don\u0027t let her be wrong. \"If I\u0027d asked him, begged him, not to do it, he\u0027d have done it. And he\u0027d strap the rig on one of the others.\"\\n\\n She pushed to her feet when Sergeant Meeks burst in. \"You think I didn\u0027t hear that? You think I didn\u0027t hear you invite him to kill my boy?\" He lunged at her. It took Sykes, Vince and Duncan to put him down, hold him down while he cursed at her. \"My boy\u0027s in there because of you. If he dies it\u0027s because of you.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not in there because of me, but if he dies, yes, that\u0027s mine. Get him out. Get him out of here.\"\\n\\n \"When are you going to talk to him about the hostages?\" Phin grabbed her arm. \"Why don\u0027t you give him something, give him something so he\u0027ll let the women go.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t-\"\\n\\n \"My wife, my mother are in there. For God\u0027s sake, for God\u0027s sake, you need to get them the hell out.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to get them out.\" She couldn\u0027t allow herself to see them-Ma Bee\u0027s dark, steady eyes, Loo\u0027s slow, sultry smile. \"I\u0027m going to call him back, and we\u0027re going to work at this until everyone\u0027s out. Phin, you have to stay calm. If you can\u0027t, I\u0027ll have to have you removed. I\u0027m sorry.\" She looked from him to Duncan now. \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll get them out.\" Duncan reached out so their fingertips touched. \"You\u0027ll get them out. Phin, your sister\u0027s out there now, and the rest of your family\u0027s coming. You should go out, be with them.\"\\n\\n \"I have to know what\u0027s happening.\" Crumbling, Phin covered his face with his hands. \"I have to know something.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll come out and tell you,\" Duncan assured him, then turned to Phoebe.\\n\\n \"Yes, that\u0027s fine. Go out with your family, Phin, let them know your mother and Loo aren\u0027t hurt. We\u0027ll keep you informed.\" She signaled to an officer. \"Escort Mr. Hector to his family. If he needs to come back in, he should be escorted back in. All right?\" She rubbed her hands up and down Phin\u0027s arms, felt the muscles quivering. \"You go, help your family. I\u0027m going to help your mother and Loo.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t lose them, Phoebe.\"\\n\\n \"We won\u0027t lose them. Go on now.\"\\n\\n \"How am I supposed to feel?\" Duncan said as Phin went out. \"They were meeting me in there.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s responsible. And I\u0027m responsible for getting them out.\" And that\u0027s what he\u0027d wanted all along, she knew. Everything else had been building to this.\\n\\n Showdown.\\n\\n \"Can I get some coffee in here?\" Phoebe called out as she rubbed at the tension at the back of her neck. \"And more water? Duncan, I have to ask you not to tell Phin anything I don\u0027t clear you to tell him.\"\\n\\n \"I got that. What can I do to help?\"\\n\\n \"Listen. You\u0027re good at listening.\" She looked up at the board Sykes had posted. \"His emotions are all over the scale. That\u0027s typical for this first stage. He wants the negotiation, that\u0027s our advantage. He doesn\u0027t want to come out of it, so that\u0027s his. I\u0027m not calling him back.\" She turned toward Vince. \"He knows how to reach me, he knows how it works. Action, right? He likes to take action, make the moves?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"It gives him more of a sense of control, of authority, if he makes the next contact. Let\u0027s give him that. Let\u0027s wait.\"\\n\\n \"Got the credit card report,\" Liz strode up quickly. \"Five-thousanddollar charge, Mark D, two weeks before the bank robbery. He made the minimum payments on it until he went south.\"\\n\\n \"Bought her a ring in there, that\u0027s what he did.\" Phoebe pushed through her notes. \"Got the property list, the personal effects. She had diamond-yellow-gold band-ring on her person. White-gold diamondcrusted wedding band in her purse. Not on her finger. She was wearing\\n\\n Walken\u0027s ring when she died. Bastard Brentine. He knew it. Maybe not before her death, but he damn well knew what had been going on when he got her effects. And he stonewalls us.\"\\n\\n She scribbled, highlighted, circled. How could she use it? Should she? Time would tell.\\n\\n \"He thinks he knows me, but he doesn\u0027t. I know him. And you know him,\" she said to Vince. \"A lot of the men out there with guns pointed at that building know him. He wants to work me, but we\u0027ll be working him. He won\u0027t allow himself to relate to any of the hostages. They have to remain meaningless to him so he can do what he means to do.\"\\n\\n \"What does he mean to do?\" Duncan asked.\\n\\n \"Kill them all. Kill himself and all of them.\"\\n\\n \"Oh Jesus God.\"\\n\\n \"To strike at me, personally and professionally. How can I ever do this again if I fail to save those people? How can I live with it? That\u0027s what he thinks.\"\\n\\n Pacing in front of the situation board, she stared at the phone, willing it to ring. \"The press and public opinion will rip me to pieces. That\u0027s what he knows. The connection between him and me will be made known, and the bank incident will be picked over again. I\u0027ll be disgraced, and useless as a negotiator, and I\u0027ll pay, finally pay, for causing his lover\u0027s death. That\u0027s what he thinks. And he\u0027ll die, in a spectacular and symbolic way. I\u0027ll have killed him, just like I killed her. That\u0027s what he wants most of all.\"\\n\\n She turned to look at the clock. \"We\u0027re not going to give him what he wants.\"\\n\\n \"Offer him a trade. He knows about us. Offer to trade me for two of the women. For Ma and Loo. I\u0027m a bigger win for him, and then-\"\\n\\n \"He wouldn\u0027t take it. And neither I nor the commander could allow it, Duncan.\"\\n\\n But he would give it, she thought. He would risk himself for love. \"Duncan.\" She spoke softly, so he could hear her heart under the words. \"I know what they mean to you. I know what you\u0027re feeling.\" And it was killing her.\\n\\n She turned as the phone rang. \"All right. Here we go. Hello, Jerry.\" Inside the bank, Ma patted the hand of the woman beside her. \"Stop crying now.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s going to kill us. He\u0027s-\"\\n\\n \"Crying doesn\u0027t help.\"\\n\\n \"We should pray.\" A man across the circle rocked gently back and forth. \"We should put our faith in the Lord.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t hurt.\" But Ma was putting a good chunk of her faith in the men outside with guns. \"Hush now,\" she repeated. \"Patsy, isn\u0027t it? Hush up now, Patsy. That woman he\u0027s talking to? She\u0027s smart.\"\\n\\n \"How do you know?\"\\n\\n Loo squeezed her mother-in-law\u0027s hand fiercely, gave a quick shake of her head. \"She sounds smart. She\u0027ll find out what he wants, and everything\u0027s going to be fine.\"\\n\\n They circled each other for more than an hour before he broke communications again. \"He\u0027s stalling. He wants to string this out, make it last.\\n\\n There\u0027s something he wants to make me do, but he\u0027s not ready yet. It\u0027s under there, I can hear it under there.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s enjoying it,\" Duncan told her. \"He likes telling you no. No food, no water, no medical supplies. He\u0027s cruising on it.\"\\n\\n \"Agreed, for now.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not going to let any of them out.\" Sykes sat down beside Phoebe. \"He doesn\u0027t want anything in exchange, and if he did, he knows that releasing any of the hostages is our advantage. They can give us inside intel, make it simpler to shut this down.\"\\n\\n \"They can\u0027t get a shot.\" Vince walked over to the situation board, gestured to the sketch of the interior of the store. \"He\u0027s in this corner, northeast corner, and there\u0027s no shot. That\u0027s why he\u0027s there.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s been on the other side,\" Phoebe concurred. \"He\u0027s familiarized himself with the layout, with the angles.\"\\n\\n \"They need to go in. Back door\u0027s the only way. A frontal assault gives him too much time. They need to deal with the explosives on the rear door.\"\\n\\n \"And if they make a mistake, if he\u0027s got an alarm on it, and it goes or blows, he\u0027ll end it.\"\\n\\n \"You have to get him out of the corner,\" Duncan said, and Phoebe turned to him.\\n\\n \"Yes, I do.\"\\n\\n \"If they can\u0027t get an angle on him, he doesn\u0027t have one on them.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\" Phoebe closed her hand briefly over Duncan\u0027s. \"That\u0027s exactly right. I need to talk to the commander. I need to know where to move him, if possible.\" She signaled to Sykes to make the call. \"They have to let me know when they\u0027re going to take him. I know that\u0027s not how it\u0027s usually done, but they can trust me not to let him know it\u0027s coming. I have to move him; they have to know that\u0027s coming.\"\\n\\n \"Got it.\" Sykes turned with his radio to signal the command post. Shoving her hair off her damp neck, Phoebe paced, tried to put herself inside the shop. \"He\u0027s going to have to let them use the bathroom at some point, unless he wants a big mess on his hands. And he doesn\u0027t. One bathroom, employees\u0027, right in the back room.\" She narrowed her eyes at the sketch. \"How does he plan to work this? He\u0027d have thought it through already, have a system ready. That\u0027s why he doesn\u0027t have all the hostages in the circle. Holding one back to release another. He doesn\u0027t have to move or interact with them to handle the basic function. But it\u0027s going to be distracting, and he\u0027ll have to be alert. He won\u0027t want to talk to me while that\u0027s going on.\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"And we\u0027re not giving him what he wants.\"\\n\\n Time, she thought, to start playing him. She picked up the phone, called.\\n\\n \"Better be you, bitch.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s always going to be me, Jerry. You know how this goes. No lying to a hostage-taker, it puts the hostages at risk. No saying no to a hostage-taker, it pisses them off, and puts the hostages at risk. I\u0027m supposed to empathize with you, be supportive of your feelings, listen to your demands and complaints.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, you were damn sympathetic with the bastards who shot Angie.\"\\n\\n \"Angela was a beautiful woman. She loved you.\"\\n\\n \"Fuck you. You don\u0027t care about her.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve made me care, Jerry. I\u0027m in love with someone, maybe you don\u0027t feel I deserve to be, but I\u0027m in love. So I understand how Angela felt about you. I understand something of what you\u0027re feeling, because if anything happened to him, I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d do.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know what we had.\"\\n\\n \"You had something special, something once in a lifetime. She was wearing your ring, Jerry. She was wearing it when she died.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"The ring you bought her in the store where you are now. She must\u0027ve treasured it. She must have been thrilled to wear it. I wanted you to know that, Jerry. I called to tell you because it proves to everyone she was yours.\"\\n\\n \"Everyone can go to hell.\"\\n\\n \"If something like this had happened to me, I\u0027d want everyone to know what we meant to each other. How much we loved each other. I think you want that, too, Jerry. I want to tell you that I do know it.\"\\n\\n There was a long beat of silence where she could only hear him breathing. \"Roy never loved me, did you know that? He never loved me or the child we made together. Can you imagine? Now that I have someone who does...\"\\n\\n She looked over at Duncan, met his eyes, so she\u0027d feel it only stronger, so it would come into her voice. \"Now that I do, everything in the world is different. It\u0027s stronger and brighter and clearer. Was it like that for you?\"\\n\\n \"She made it beautiful. And bright. Now it\u0027s black.\"\\n\\n Grief, she wrote. Tears. Careful, careful, she thought. If she tipped him too deeply into grief, he could end it all now. \"She wouldn\u0027t want the black for you, Jerry. Someone who loved you the way Angela loved you wouldn\u0027t want you in the black.\"\\n\\n \"You put her there. I\u0027m not leaving her there alone.\"\\n\\n \"She-\"\\n\\n \"You shut up! You shut up about her.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, Jerry. I hear that I\u0027ve upset you. I\u0027m sorry. You know it\u0027s not my purpose here to upset you.\"\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s your fucking purpose to talk to me like I\u0027m an idiot until\\n\\n I come out crying with my hands in the air. You think you can play me? You think I\u0027m going out that way after I\u0027ve come this far?\"\\n\\n \"I think you\u0027re preparing to commit suicide, and take those people with you.\"\\n\\n \"Is that what you think?\" he said, and she noted the smug satisfaction in his tone.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a big statement, Jerry. And a big black mark on my record. But we could spin it, you know how it goes. It\u0027s overkill. Seventeen\u0027s our count. A lot of people for you to deal with, and a lot to take down. Now, if you were to let the women out-\"\\n\\n \"Come on, Phoebe. That\u0027s a lame pass.\"\\n\\n \"It might seem like a lame pass to you, but I\u0027ve got to do my job here. I guess we both know it\u0027s time for me to ask how everyone\u0027s doing in there.\"\\n\\n She rubbed the back of her neck as they took each other through the dance-requests and refusals for food, water, medical attention. And the clock ticked off another hour. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/high-noon/page-30.html","bookId":2412,"book":{"id":2412,"title":"High Noon","description":"Storyline: Police Lieutenant Phoebe MacNamara found her calling at an early age when an unstable man broke into her family\u0027s home, trapping and terrorizing them for hours.
