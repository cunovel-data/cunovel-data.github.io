{"id":75269,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"By her request, Phoebe received notification when Charles Johnson\u0027s body was cleared for release. Noting the information, she contacted the funeral home regarding viewings. Controversy and public debate aside, she needed to pay her respects. She could do so discreetly, and briefly. It meant canceling her date with Duncan, but that might be for the best. A little cooling-off time there, she decided. A little stop-and-thinkitthrough. She made the call, and though it was cowardly, felt a trickle of relief when she got his voice mail. \"Duncan, it\u0027s Phoebe. I have to cancel tonight, sorry. Something came... \" Not fair, she reminded herself. He\u0027d done nothing to deserve the \"something came up\" brush-off. \"Actually, they\u0027re holding a viewing for Charlie Johnson tonight, and I need to go. So I\u0027ll need a rain check. We\u0027ll talk later, all right? I\u0027m just about on my way to a meeting.\" Ass-covering was de rigueur, and Phoebe couldn\u0027t fault the department for going into circle-the-wagon mode. Or, she supposed, for looking for a reasonable scapegoat. She was fully prepared to defend her own actions and methods, if and when. She sat through the meeting with the crisis team, the chief and the representatives from IAB. Questions were asked and answered. Her log was displayed, the situation tape replayed. She listened to her voice, to Commander Harrison\u0027s, to Charlie\u0027s and Opal\u0027s, to the relays between her or the second negotiator and command, from command to members of the tactical team. \"Lieutenant MacNamara clearly related the information that the HT agreed to surrender, was coming out unarmed. That information was received and acknowledged.\" The chief lifted his hands. \"There was no breakdown in communications. The tactical commander did not give the go, and the shots were not fired by any authorized member of the department.\" He paused. \"The shots were fired from a weapon-recovered-not issued to any member of the crisis team, from a position where no member of said team was posted. Known members of the rival gang live in the building from where the shots issued, other known or suspected members reside inside the perimeter set during the crisis. These are facts. But there\u0027s another. The perimeter was breached. And from that fact come more questions. Who and how and when? The breech opens the department up to criticism and speculation, and potentially to civil suits.\" \"The who is being investigated,\" Harrison began. He was a toughlooking man of considerable presence, with a deep basso designed for giving orders. \"Every known gang member of the Lords and the Posse is being interrogated. It\u0027s a long process, sir.\" \"The how?\" The chief looked directly at the tactical commander. \"The building was cleared in a floor-by-floor sweep.\" Harrison got to his feet, stepped over to the diagram. \"A three-man team entered the building here. Civilians were evacuated and moved outside the barricades. While this location wasn\u0027t optimum for coverage of the hostage scene, members were posted on the roof and at this third-floor post. Other members were posted in the building directly south, as this location afforded the best visual of the liquor store from the front. Others were posted here, to cover the back. Here, the sides. \"Each building was cleared, or thought to be cleared, and the perimeters set and posted. There were disturbances here and here during the negotiations. Heckling and threats from some onlookers. And here, a physical altercation between local residents.\" He straightened stiffly as he turned. \"It\u0027s possible that someone slipped through during the incendiary first stage. More likely, in my opinion, someone already inside the building slipped into the vacated apartment and set up his sniper\u0027s nest. The team\u0027s objective was to get civilians to safety quickly. It\u0027s not possible in these circumstances to spread the team thin enough to check every closet, under every bed. If someone was determined to evade detection, they could and would.\" \"Someone armed with an AK-47?\" Harrison\u0027s mouth tightened. \"Yes, sir, as was the case.\" \"Chief.\" Phoebe caught Dave\u0027s frown when she interrupted. \"You said the questions were how, who, when. Respectfully, I think a vital question is why. We can speculate, given the gang violence, the weapon used, the fact that its serial number was filed off, a member-or sympathizerof the east side Lords is responsible. But I\u0027ve been back to the scene, and I stood in the window where those shots were fired. I\u0027ve looked at the diagrams, read the reports, replayed the corns.\" \"As have I,\" the chief reminded her. \"Then you\u0027re aware, sir, there were dozens of police officers and personnel outside at any given time during those hours. Officers and personnel in the open from the angle of the sniper\u0027s nest. Yet none of them was fired on. When Johnson was shot, not a single police officer was hit. Nearly every bullet went into Charles Johnson. I believe any of our tactical team would agree that\u0027s some damn fine shooting.\" \"Knew what he was doing,\" Harrison agreed, meeting Phoebe\u0027s questioning glance. \"As a negotiator, as someone who studies and deals with human behavior, I have to say it\u0027s also some superior control. \"Why kill Charles Johnson?\" she continued. \"He was low rung in the Posse.\" \"He\u0027d made a stink on their turf,\" the chief pointed out. \"He was demanding their captain be brought to him. It\u0027s disrespect.\" \"Agreed. Agreed. So maybe one or more of them would try to take him down, try to make an example of him. But if one of them was already in the building, or otherwise breached it-armed-it also strikes as solid forethought. Planning, sir, not just a lucky opportunity.\" \"A conspiracy theory, Lieutenant?\" She could hear the weariness in the chiefs voice. He was more politician than cop, Phoebe knew-and politicians don\u0027t care for conspiracies. \"Just speculation that there are other possibilities. Johnson may have been set up, goaded into going there. Someone outside either gang may have seen this incident as an opportunity to create chaos and dissent. Or-\" She broke off when the chief raised a hand. \"Lieutenant, we\u0027re trying to defuse a powder keg, not add fuel. There are a lot of questions to be answered. For now, the most important apply to our own responsibility. The logs, transcripts, statements and corns show that you upheld yours. Now.\" He turned back to the crisis commander. \"When the gunfire occurred... \" After the meeting, Phoebe went down to the firing range to work off some frustration. She set the target, put on her ear protectors and fired a clip. Then could only sigh at her scores. She set again, fired again. \"You\u0027ve always been a crappy shot.\" Reviewing her grouping on the target, ear protectors lowered, Phoebe shrugged at Dave. \"Extremely crappy. I don\u0027t practice enough.\" \"A good negotiator\u0027s rarely going to have to draw, much less discharge, a weapon. Not when she listens and talks as well as you do. Which is why-since you do-I wonder what you were doing up there in that meeting.\" \"Asking questions like someone taught me. Trying to make sure the focus isn\u0027t so narrow we miss what may be outside the blinders. I don\u0027t understand what happened out there, and I can\u0027t just swallow the easy solution.\" \"Has it occurred to you that you don\u0027t understand, and you can\u0027t swallow, because you did what you were supposed to do? You talked him down, talked him out. And you still lost him. You\u0027ve been doing this long enough to know what an impact losing one has.\" As he spoke, he set himself up with a fresh target. Once he\u0027d fired his clip, he and Phoebe studied his results together. \"You\u0027re a crappy shot, too.\" \"Yeah, but you\u0027re still crappier. How have you been sleeping?\" \"Spotty. I know the signs, Dave. And yes, I have some of the classicsI feel let down, stressed, restless, irritable. But I know it, and I know why. What I don\u0027t know is why that boy\u0027s dead. That\u0027s the reason I spoke up in the meeting.\" \"Phoebe, the chief isn\u0027t what we\u0027d call a creative thinker. He\u0027s more politician than cop-\" \"I thought the same thing when we were up there. I guess we share more than crappy shooting.\" He let out a half laugh, rubbed her shoulder. \"Well, believe me, he\u0027s more concerned now with public relations and the possibility of civil liability than why a sixteen-year-old gangbanger\u0027s dead.\" \"You have ambitions for me.\" She loaded another clip. \"I know that, too, Dave. I appreciate it.\" \"If I\u0027ve got a legacy, it\u0027s you and Carter.\" Someone fired down the line, and the sound was harsh in contrast to his quiet voice. \"When I\u0027m ready to turn in my papers, I want to know you\u0027re taking my desk.\" He\u0027d wanted children; his wife hadn\u0027t. Though he\u0027d never told her, Phoebe knew it because she knew him. So she and Carter were his. \"You\u0027re worried if I speak up too often and don\u0027t say what the brass wants to hear, I\u0027m shooting myself in the foot. Which is something I believe I could manage in the literal sense as it\u0027s fairly close range.\" \"The chief wants this put to bed. If he has to sacrifice Harrison in the public arena, he will. He\u0027d sacrifice you, but there\u0027re no grounds. The simple fact is, Phoebe, logic and circumstances strongly support the idea that this was gang-related. A crime of opportunity and turf. That\u0027s the drum that\u0027s going to be beat.\" \"Maybe someone should listen to what\u0027s under the drum.\" She lifted her weapon again and fired. Stupid, Phoebe thought later. Stupid to push and prod where the only result was going to be annoyance to all parties. Politics and public relations were going to play this out, she reminded herself as she changed into a gray suit-black seemed too presumptuous somehow. She had nothing to add to the mix that wasn\u0027t already on record. Except for a few minutes before she\u0027d taken over negotiations, and that horrible aftermath, she\u0027d been inside the diner. Nobody liked a Monday-morning quarterback, she told herself. She would go to Charles Johnson\u0027s viewing, then she would have to put it away. No comment, she promised herself, unless the department directed otherwise. What more did she have to say, in any case? She pinned her hair back. Nothing would sober the color, she mused, but the style seemed more respectful than loose. She stepped into the family parlor. Her mother was crocheting in front of the TV, and Carly was sprawled on the floor paging through a picture book. Puppies, Phoebe realized with a little sink in the belly. \"I\u0027m heading out now. I shouldn\u0027t be more than an hour.\" \"Mama! Wait, Mama, look! Aren\u0027t they cute?\" Carly scrambled up to hold out the book. The page was full of irresistible balls of fur and adorability. \"They are, sweetie. They couldn\u0027t be cuter. But they also need to be fed and watered and walked, and cleaned up after, and trained, and-\" \"But you said someday we could get a puppy.\" \"I said maybe someday.\" And only after she\u0027d been worn down to a nub by pleading glances from those big blue eyes. \"And I\u0027m just not sure it\u0027s someday yet. I can\u0027t talk about it now because I have to go. And this isn\u0027t going to be just my decision. I\u0027m at work all day and you\u0027re in school, so I need to discuss this with Gran and Ava before we get close to thinking about it. Where is Ava?\" \"Book club.\" Essie gave Phoebe a puzzled look. \"She mentioned it at dinner.\" \"Oh, of course she did. Slipped my mind.\" No, Phoebe admitted. She hadn\u0027t heard a word anyone had said at dinner. Apparently she hadn\u0027t just stopped active listening but listening at all. Time to pull it back together. \"You be good for Gran.\" Phoebe bent to kiss the top of Carly\u0027s head. \"I\u0027ll be back before long.\" As she walked out she heard Carly using her slyest, most sugarcoated tone. \"Gran, you like puppies, don\u0027t you?\" It should\u0027ve been funny. She wished she could see it as funny. But all she could think about as she headed downstairs was that Carly was going to manipulate the other two adults in the house until they ended up with some shoe-chewing, puddle-making, middle-of-the-nightwhimpering canine. She liked dogs, damn it. But she just wasn\u0027t ready to take on another responsibility. She knew Ava planned to take her son on a trip out West this summer. She deserved it, absolutely. And it meant ten days where there was no one around to run to the store, the bank, the dry cleaner\u0027s, to haul Carly, to do all the endless errands. She already had an active seven-year-old and an agoraphobic to tend to. Phoebe didn\u0027t think it made her a heartless monster not to want to add a puppy to the mix. But, of course, she felt like one, so when she opened the front door to go out, her scowl was already full-blown. Duncan came up the last step to the portico. \"That\u0027s timing.\" \"What are you doing here? You didn\u0027t get my message? I\u0027m sorry, but-\" \"No, I got it. I\u0027m going with you.\" \"To the funeral home?\" Shaking her head, she closed the door firmly behind her. \"No, you\u0027re not. Why should you? You didn\u0027t know him.\" \"I know you, and you shouldn\u0027t go alone. Why should you?\" \"I\u0027m perfectly capable.\" \"A reason you could, but not why you should. If it irritates you so much to have me along, you\u0027ll just have to pretend I\u0027m not there. You don\u0027t go into something like this by yourself. That\u0027s stupid, and you\u0027re not.\" Phoebe yanked out her sunglasses, shoved them on. \"Simple competence and responsibility aren\u0027t stupidity, thank you very much.\" \"Okay.\" Hair trigger, he thought again. Why did he like that about her? \"Do you want to stand out here debating the issue, or do you want to go do this thing?\" \"I\u0027m not going to drive up to this poor boy\u0027s viewing in a Porsche and walk in with some rich guy in Armani.\" \"First.\" He stepped aside, gestured. There was a black sedan of some sort at the curb. \"Second, this is Hugo Boss, or maybe Calvin Klein. I can\u0027t keep that sort of thing straight-so now that I think about it, it may be Armani. And I may be rich but I grew up not two spits from where that kid spent his short sixteen years. Not in a mansion on Jones. So don\u0027t call the pot, honey.\" She stared a moment, then shook her head. \"A few minutes ago something that should\u0027ve made me laugh just couldn\u0027t. Now this just strikes me as funny. Or maybe it\u0027s just ridiculous.\" She reached forward, flipped back the side of his jacket to find the label. \"I was right about the designer. Never test the mother of a minifashionista.\" \"Points for you.\" \"No, for you.\" Irritable and let down, she thought. Yes, she knew the signs. \"Thanks for coming to go with me. I was keeping the mad on the front burner so I wouldn\u0027t feel too much of the sad. And I neglected to remember one thing.\" \"Which one thing?\" \"This isn\u0027t about me.\" She stepped down. \"So, you\u0027ve got a shiny black sedan. Sort of dignified.\" \"I thought about bringing the pickup, but that seemed wrong. And the SUV\u0027s just too big.\" He shrugged as he opened the car door. \"I\u0027m a guy. I have cars. It\u0027s what we do.\" \"As I have a car that is well on its way to becoming a heap, I appreciate being able to go in one of your manly fleet.\" She put a hand on his over the door handle. \"I\u0027m used to going alone, and I suppose that leads me to think I should. But I don\u0027t always want to, and I also appreciate you figuring that out before I did.\" Because she looked as if she needed it, Duncan leaned down to touch his lips to hers. \"I\u0027m making a study of figuring you out.\" The funeral home was small, the parking lot already crowded with cars and people. Phoebe saw reporters on the edge of the property. Some were doing interviews, others trying to hunt them up. \"Probably another way in,\" Duncan commented. Avoiding the press was priority one, so she\u0027d already prepared for it. \"There\u0027s a side door, I checked. I thought I\u0027d slip in and out that way. Five minutes. There\u0027ll be representatives from the department here. That\u0027s SOP on a homicide-and in this case, it\u0027s image, too. I\u0027m not officially here.\" \"Got it.\" He found a place on the street, then glanced down at her heels. \"Can you hike a block in those?\" \"I\u0027m a girl. It\u0027s what we do.\" When they were on the sidewalk and he took her hand, she looked up at him. And for the second time since she\u0027d met him, Phoebe thought, Oh, well. Damn. \"What?\" \"Nothing. Nothing.\" She looked away again. Hell of a time for her heart to start thumping, she decided, hell of a time for it to trip and fall. They were on their way to pay their respects to the mother of a dead boy. And she stumbled face-first into love. It made no sense at all. \"Sure you want to do this?\" She knew she didn\u0027t. If she couldn\u0027t face the idea of training a puppy, how the hell was she supposed to deal with falling in love? But, of course, since he couldn\u0027t read her mind, he wasn\u0027t speaking of the big, long drop she\u0027d just taken. \"I want to do it, for Charlie and his mother. And I guess part is about me. I need the ritual of it. I don\u0027t do well when I\u0027m mad and sad, and I\u0027m having a hard time putting either, or both, of those feelings away for very long.\" Slipping into the side door was simple enough. But before Phoebe could congratulate herself on avoiding the gauntlet out front, she found herself faced with another inside. A group of people clustered in and around a small parlor to the side of the main viewing room. The squeak of the door had heads turning. Conversations stopped instantly. They weren\u0027t the only white faces, Phoebe noted. A few were scattered in. But her face had been on television. She saw recognition in some of the stares aimed her way, and resentment in others. The crowd parted for a tall man, or maybe it parted for the anger pumping off him. \"You got no place here. You get the hell out before-\" \"You don\u0027t speak for me.\" Opal pushed forward. She looked a decade older than she had in the diner, with her eyes sunken dark in her face as if they\u0027d never find light again. \"You don\u0027t speak for my boy or for me.\" \"This here\u0027s for family. It\u0027s for neighborhood.\" \"You going to speak to me of family now, my brother? Where was my family when I needed them? You were up in Charlotte. You weren\u0027t here in the neighborhood. You don\u0027t speak for me.\" She drew herself up. \"Lieutenant MacNamara.\" \"Mrs. Johnson, I\u0027m sorry to intrude. I wanted to pay my respects to you and Charlie. I won\u0027t stay.\" \"Lieutenant MacNamara.\" Opal stepped forward and embraced Phoebe. \"Thank you for coming here,\" she said quietly. \"Thank you for not forgetting.\" Emotion flooded Phoebe\u0027s throat, stung her eyes, ached in her heart. \"I won\u0027t ever forget.\" \"Would you come with me, please?\" Clutching Phoebe\u0027s hand, Opal turned. The man who\u0027d spoken stood barring the way. \"Don\u0027t you shame me. Don\u0027t you shame me so that this is the last time I look at your face.\" \"Your sons are dead, Opal.\" \"My sons are dead. And I have something to say.\" She walked through the crowd of mourners to the front door. Her fingers twined in Phoebe\u0027s trembling ones. \"Opal-\" \"I\u0027ve been afraid of so many things,\" Opal said. \"Most all my life. Maybe, I\u0027d been braver things\u0027d be different. I don\u0027t know, and it\u0027s hard not to question God\u0027s will. But I\u0027m going to do this one thing, this one thing. And maybe, maybe, I won\u0027t be so afraid.\" When she stepped out the front door with Phoebe, reporters shouted out, cameras whirled. Priority one, she thought, had been thoroughly breached. But there was a woman who\u0027d lost her sons, who was clinging to her, who didn\u0027t give a damn about protocol. \"I got something to say.\" Opal\u0027s voice cracked, and her hand tightened like a vise on Phoebe\u0027s. \"Y\u0027all been calling my home, and my mother\u0027s home. Calling where I work. I told you I wanted my privacy, but you won\u0027t give it. I got such sorrow in me, and I asked you to respect my grief. But you come \u0027round my house, my mama\u0027s, you call on the telephone. Say you want me to tell you what I got inside me, what I think, what I feel. And some of you? You offer me money to talk to you.\" Questions boomed out. Didyou... Have you... How didyou... Opal\u0027s arm shook as if with a spasm as she turned those dark, sunken eyes on Phoebe. \"Lieutenant MacNamara.\" \"Let\u0027s go back inside, Opal,\" Phoebe murmured. \"I\u0027ll take you back inside, to your family.\" \"Stand here with me, please. Would you stand here with me so I can do this?\" Opal closed her eyes, then lifted her voice over the storm. \"I\u0027ve got something to say here, something to say for free, and you\u0027ll just hush if you want to hear it. My sons are dead.\" In the silence that followed, Phoebe heard Opal\u0027s indrawn sob. \"My boys are dead. Both killed. Guns and bullets took their bodies, but it was something else took \u0027em before that. They had no hope. They had a fever of anger and hate and blame, but no hope to cool it. I wish I could\u0027ve given them that, but I couldn\u0027t get it into them. \"You want me to blame somebody. You want to see me point my finger, to scream and cry and curse. You won\u0027t. You want me to blame the gangs? They got part of it. The police? They got part. Then so do I got part, and my own dead babies, they got part. There\u0027s plenty of blame to spread around. I don\u0027t care for that. Doesn\u0027t matter about that.\" She pulled a tissue from her pocket to mop her tears. \"I know this woman standing beside me talked to my boy, and listened to my boy. For hours. And when that terrible thing happened that took my boy away so I can\u0027t ever have him again? She ran toward him. Didn\u0027t matter to her who was to blame. She ran to him to try to help. And when I could see again, when I could see, what I saw was her holding my son. And that\u0027s what matters. \"Now I got nothing more to say.\" Ignoring the hurled questions, Opal turned for the door. Her body shook lightly as Phoebe put a protective arm around her shoulders. \"I\u0027m going to take you to see my Charlie now.\" \"Okay, Opal.\" Taking Opal\u0027s weight, Phoebe walked toward the viewing room. \"Let\u0027s go see Charlie.\" Phoebe\u0027s knees felt a little weak by the time she returned to the car. It was funny, she thought, how joints often took the brunt of emotional upheavals. Duncan merely ran a hand down her arm, then started the ignition. \"I need to make a call,\" she said, and pulled out her phone. Impulse again, she reminded herself. She seemed to be doing a lot on impulse these days. \"Mama? I\u0027m going to be going out awhile if you don\u0027t need me back. Yes, all right. Tell Carly I\u0027ll come in and kiss her good night when I get home. I will. Bye.\" She drew in a deep breath. \"All right?\" \"Sure. Where do you want to go?\" \"I think your place would be just fine. Then you can fix me a nice cold drink of an alcoholic nature. And after we\u0027ve had a nice cold drink, you can take me up to bed.\" \"That fits pretty well into my schedule.\" \"That\u0027s good, because it seems to be just the thing that was missing in mine.\" She leaned back, flipped through issues that were on her mind. \"Duncan, what do you think of a man who decides to marry a woman named Mizzy who\u0027s a dozen years younger than he is?\" \"How big are her breasts?\" Phoebe\u0027s lips twitched as she stared up through the sunroof. \"I don\u0027t have that information.\" N-o r a R o b e r ts \"It\u0027s pretty relevant. Who\u0027s marrying Mizzy?\" \"Carly\u0027s father.\" \"Oh.\" Sympathy and speculation, Phoebe thought, in a single syllable. \"I know I shouldn\u0027t care, but of course I do. I know I\u0027ll get over thatwhich is comforting. He\u0027s moving with her to Europe, which infuriates me, and which I won\u0027t get over even though I know it\u0027s stupid. It doesn\u0027t matter if he\u0027s around the corner or thousands of miles away, he\u0027s not going to love that sweet child, or pretend he does.\" \"But if he\u0027s around the corner, so to speak, you can keep hoping he might eventually.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" That, she realized, was exactly, perfectly right. \"Opal Johnson couldn\u0027t push hope into her sons, and they needed it. I can\u0027tor haven\u0027t-let go of mine when it\u0027s a useless weight.\" \"How does Carly feel?\" \"Carly doesn\u0027t care.\" They soared over the water, where boats skimmed below the span of bridge. \"She\u0027s healthier about it than I am.\" \"She has you. A kid knows she\u0027s loved, absolutely, she\u0027s got a healthy base.\" He hadn\u0027t had that absolute love, she remembered, but had built his own base. \"I haven\u0027t told her about the wedding yet. I will, when I\u0027m not so mad. I don\u0027t think he\u0027d have bothered to tell me about all this except the child support checks will be delayed while he changes banks. Changes his damn dollars to Euros and back again. Whatever.\" \"So you\u0027re pissed he\u0027s moving to Europe.\" \"Oh, I\u0027m just pissed altogether.\" And suddenly just a little amused at the entire business. \"I don\u0027t care who she is, no woman likes being traded in on the Mizzy model. Especially when the trade-in has a lot higher mileage.\" \"I bet the Mizzy model is high maintenance and can\u0027t handle the curves nearly as well.\" \"Hopeful thought. I\u0027m telling you all this because it factors into my overall mood, which is restless and conflicted, and a little aggressive.\" The faintest smile curved her lips as she tilted her head to study his profile. \"I\u0027m wondering how you feel about aggressive women.\" \"Am I going to find out?\" \"I believe you are.\" \"Oh boy.\" When they were inside his house, she decided the cold drink could wait. They\u0027d both probably need a gallon of cold liquid after they were done. Since he\u0027d been considerate enough to wear a tie, she grabbed it and, strolling toward the stairs, pulled him behind her. \"Bedroom\u0027s up here, I assume? We didn\u0027t get that far last time.\" \"To the right, all the way down. Last on the left.\" When she glanced over her shoulder, her eyes sparked on his. \"I bet the view\u0027s lovely. We won\u0027t be paying much mind to that for a while, but I bet it\u0027s lovely.\" She tugged him inside. She got the impression of space, of strong colors, tall windows. And best of all, a big iron bed. \"Now.\" She turned, tugged the knot on his tie loose. \"This may hurt a little.\" \"My tolerance for pain is rising as we speak.\" Laughing, she yanked his jacket off, flung it aside. Then backed him toward the bed, where she gave him a little shove until he sat. With slow, deliberate movements, she straddled him so the skirt of the sober business suit hiked high on her thighs. \"Now, gimme that mouth.\" She used her teeth on it, her tongue, and all those wildly veering emotions coalesced into one hard, hot ball of lust. Her fingers got busy with his shirt, flipping open button after button until she could run her hands over flesh, scrape her nails over him. The quickening of his breath, the urgent way his hands streaked over her, made her feel invincible. She let him peel her jacket off, tug the tank over her head. And, arching back, invited his lips and hands to feast and to take. The way he took, the way he feasted, electrified. She was clamped around him, arms and legs. The most seductive of traps. A careless rake of his fingers and her hair came spilling down, fragrant red rain. A quick flick and her breasts, white satin, filled his hands. Energized silk, he thought. Everything about her was smooth, soft, everything inside her so avid with purpose. She let out a gasping laugh when he flipped her onto her back. Then a low purr of pleasure as his hands, his lips began to roam over her. Slowly now, he slid the skirt down her hips, her legs, following the movement with his mouth. The inside of her thigh, so firm and warm. The back of her knee, sensitive enough to cause quivers. And when he retraced the route, and found her center, she went from quiver to quake. Pleasure, dark and deep, swamped her. Sensation powered into sensation in a roaring, raging river. She tumbled into it, drowned in it until he dragged her gasping to the surface only to plunge her down again. She rolled with him, hands slipping, sliding over flesh damp with sweat; her mouth, frantic, greedy, seeking his. Until at last, at last, she straddled him again, took him in. Deep, deep as hearts thundered. Their bodies locked. She rode him hard and long. His hands gripped her hips as she bowed forward or back. The sheer beauty of that shape, that silhouette, shimmered in his mind while the stunning drive of need ruled his body. And all of it was her. There was nothing but her when he shot blindly over that last jagged edge. When she collapsed on him, simply fell limb by limb, he managed one final groan. \"I forgot-\" She had to stop to wheeze in another breath. \"I didn\u0027t-I remembered that time. One suit off, another suit on.\" She let out a weak laugh. \"No, not that-good memory, by the way. I was going to say I forgot how much I like sex.\" He rested his forehead on her shoulder and hoped that, eventually, his brain would find its way back home. \"Happy to remind you, as often as possible.\" \"Oh God, Duncan, I\u0027d give almost anything for a glass of water. A half glass. One swallow.\" \"Okay, okay, don\u0027t beg. It\u0027s embarrassing.\" He rolled her over, and she kept going until she was splayed on her belly. \"You\u0027re my hero,\" she mumbled into the pillow, and drifted off. A faint smile curved her lips as she heard him walking back into the bedroom. Then she leaped in shock as the ice water hit the center of her back. \"Duncan!\" \"What?\" He stood, an innocent smile on his face, the glass in his hand. \"You said you wanted water. You didn\u0027t say where you wanted it.\" Eyes narrowed, she got to her knees, held out a hand. She took a long sip. Then, with a half laugh, reached out to tug his hair. \"Very funny.\" She tugged him again until his lips met hers. Then poured the rest of the water over his head.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/high-noon/page-19.html","bookId":2412,"book":{"id":2412,"title":"High Noon","description":"Storyline: Police Lieutenant Phoebe MacNamara found her calling at an early age when an unstable man broke into her family\u0027s home, trapping and terrorizing them for hours.
