{"id":2412,"title":"High Noon","description":"Storyline: Police Lieutenant Phoebe MacNamara found her calling at an early age when an unstable man broke into her family\u0027s home, trapping and terrorizing them for hours. Now she\u0027s Savannah\u0027s top hostage negotiator, defusing powderkeg situations with a talent for knowing when to give in-and when to jump in and take action. It\u0027s satisfying work-and sometimes those skills come in handy at home dealing with her agoraphobic mother, still traumatized by the break-in after all these years, and her precocious seven-year-old, Carly. \\n It\u0027s exactly that heady combination of steely courage and sensitivity that first attracts Duncan Swift to Phoebe. After observing her coax one of his employees down from a roof ledge, he is committed to keeping this intriguing, take-charge woman in his life. She\u0027s used to working solo, but Phoebe\u0027s discovering that no amount of negotiation can keep Duncan at arm\u0027s length. \\n And when she\u0027s grabbed by a man who throws a hood over her head and brutally assaults her-in her own precinct house-Phoebe can\u0027t help but be deeply shaken. Then threatening messages show up on her doorstep, and she\u0027s not just alarmed but frustrated. How do you go face-to-face with an opponent who refuses to look you in the eye? \\n Now, with Duncan backing her up every step of the way, she must establish contact with the faceless tormentor who is determined to make her a hostage to fear . . . before she becomes the final showdown.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/high-noon.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
