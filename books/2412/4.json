{"id":75254,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"She\u0027d no more than reached the top of the stairs when her mother and Ava slipped out of the TV room with big, expectant smiles.\\n\\n \"So?\" Essie began. \"How was it?\"\\n\\n \"It was fine. It was a drink.\" If she\u0027d been wearing socks, Phoebe thought as she aimed for her bedroom, they\u0027d have blown clear across Jones Street during that good-night kiss.\\n\\n Behind her back, Essie and Ava exchanged a look, then headed off in pursuit.\\n\\n \"Well, what\u0027s he like? What did you talk about? Come on, Phoebs.\"\\n\\n Ava clasped her hands together as if in prayer. \"Give us dateless wonders the scoop.\"\\n\\n \"We had a beer in his very nice pub. I enjoyed it. I\u0027m going to work out.\"\\n\\n Another look was exchanged when Phoebe went to her dresser to pull out yoga pants and a sports bra.\\n\\n \"What\u0027d you talk about?\"\\n\\n Phoebe glanced at her mother in the mirror, shrugged. She began to strip and change. She\u0027d lived among women too long to worry about nudity. \"This and that. He used to tend bar and drive a cab.\"\\n\\n \"Hmm. So he\u0027s enterprising, isn\u0027t he?\"\\n\\n \"You could say.\"\\n\\n \"Where does he live?\" Ava pressed. \"In the city?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t ask.\"\\n\\n \"Well, for goodness sake.\" Essie cast her eyes to the ceiling. \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"It didn\u0027t come up.\" Phoebe reached in the little silver trinket box on her dresser for a tie, whipped her hair back into a tail.\\n\\n \"What about his people?\" Essie demanded. \"Who are his family, his-\"\\n\\n \"That didn\u0027t come up either. I sort of got distracted.\"\\n\\n \"Because he was charming,\" Essie decided.\\n\\n \"He was-is-very charming. But I was distracted, considerably, when he told me he won the lottery several years ago, to the tune of a hundred and thirty-eight million.\"\\n\\n She sailed out on that, automatically peeking in to check on Carly before moving to the stairs and up to the third floor.\\n\\n She\u0027d commandeered what had once been a maid\u0027s room for a little home gym. An indulgence on her part, Phoebe knew, but it also saved a health club fee and meant she could get an hour in early in the morning or at night, after Carly was in bed.\\n\\n Work kept her away from home enough without adding gym time to it.\\n\\n She\u0027d sprung for an elliptical machine, a few free weights, and even a small TV to play exercise tapes. Carly often practiced her gymnastics while she worked out, so that was the big benefit of more motherdaughter time. Her mother and Ava used the equipment, so it paid for itself.\\n\\n In the end it wasn\u0027t only more convenient but more economical. At least that\u0027s how she\u0027d justified the expense.\\n\\n Phoebe smiled to herself as she set the machine and climbed on. Her mother and Ava were already at the doorway, gaping.\\n\\n \"Did you say million?\" Essie demanded. \"I did.\"\\n\\n \"I remember that, I remember something about that.\" Ava laid a hand on her heart. \"Millionaire cabdriver. That\u0027s what they called him. Local boy. Single ticket. Oh my God! That\u0027s him?\"\\n\\n \"In the flesh.\"\\n\\n \"Well. God. I think I\u0027m going to sit down.\" Essie did so, right on the floor. \"That\u0027s not just rich, not even just wealthy. I don\u0027t know what it is.\"\\n\\n \"Lucky?\" Phoebe suggested.\\n\\n \"And then some.\" Ava joined Essie on the floor. \"He bought you a beer.\"\\n\\n Amused, Phoebe kicked her warm-up to the next level. \"Yeah. And pretzels. Then he drove me home in his Porsche.\"\\n\\n \"Is he slick?\" Essie\u0027s brows drew together, and the frown line Phoebe had inherited instead of dimples creased between them. \"That much money, he\u0027s likely slick.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not. Smooth,\" Phoebe decided after a moment. \"He\u0027s pretty damn smooth, but I have a feeling that\u0027s innate. He talked me into having dinner with him Saturday night.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re dating a millionaire.\" Ava nudged Essie with her elbow. \"Our little girl\u0027s dating a millionaire.\"\\n\\n Because the idea made her nervous, Phoebe bumped the resistance up another notch-on the machine, and in her. \"I don\u0027t know about dating. I\u0027m not interested in dating anybody. It\u0027s too damn much trouble. What are you going to wear, what are you going to talk about? Is he going to want to have sex-and there I say: Duh. Are you going to want to have sex, which actually does require some thought and consideration.\" \"Dinner,\" Ava reminded her. \"Saturday night.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, he\u0027s smooth,\" Phoebe muttered. \"He\u0027s pretty damn smooth.\"\\n\\n The scene was a little storefront operation. Jasper C. Hughes, Attorney at Law. The intelligence Phoebe had indicated that Hughes, one Tracey Percell and an armed individual named William Gradey were barricaded inside.\\n\\n The tactical team continued setting up outer and inner perimeters. Phoebe grabbed her ready box and headed for the first on scene. She was already unhappy knowing it was Arnie Meeks.\\n\\n \"Situation.\"\\n\\n Arnie wore dark glasses, but she could feel the derision in his eyes as he stared down at her. \"Guy\u0027s got two hostages. Witnesses heard gunfire. When I arrived, the subject yelled out that if anybody tried to come in, he\u0027d kill them both.\" Phoebe waited a beat. \"That\u0027s it?\"\\n\\n Arnie shrugged. \"Subject claims the lawyer cheated him out of six thousand dollars and he wants it back.\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the log, Officer?\"\\n\\n The way his lips curled, Phoebe wondered if he practiced the sarcastic look in the mirror.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been trying to keep this asshole from killing two people. I haven\u0027t had time for a log.\"\\n\\n \"At what time was gunfire heard?\"\\n\\n \"Approximately nine A.M.\"\\n\\n \"Nine?\" She could feel both temper and fear knot up inside her.\\n\\n \"Nearly two hours ago, and you\u0027ve just decided to send for a negotiator?\"\\n\\n \"I have the situation under control.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re relieved. You-\" She pointed to another uniformed cop as she pulled a log sheet out of her ready kit. \"Everything gets written down. Time, activity, who says what and when.\" She took out a notebook.\\n\\n Arnie grabbed her arm. \"You can\u0027t just walk in here and take over.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I can.\" She wrenched free. \"The captain\u0027s on his way, and Commander Harrison is in charge of Tactical. Meanwhile, I\u0027m in charge here, as negotiator. Get the hostage-taker on the phone,\" she ordered the cop she\u0027d drafted as second negotiator.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m the one keeping this from blowing up.\"\\n\\n \"Is that so?\" She whipped around to Arnie. \"Have you spoken to either hostage? Have you ascertained that they\u0027re still alive? If they\u0027ve been harmed? If anyone requires medical attention? Where is your situation board? Your log? What progress have you made toward ending this situation without loss of life in the damn near two hours before you deigned to call this in?\"\\n\\n She grabbed the phone, checked her notebook where she\u0027d already written down names.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to talk to you!\" The voice that answered screamed with emotion and fury. \"I said I\u0027m through talking to you.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. Gradey? This is Phoebe MacNamara. I\u0027m a negotiator with the police department. You\u0027ll be talking to me now. You sound upset. Is everyone all right in there, Mr. Gradey? Does anyone have medical problems I should know about?\"\\n\\n \"Everything\u0027s gone to hell. It\u0027s all gone to hell.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s try to work all this out. Is it all right if I call you William? Is that what people call you?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m through talking!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m here to help.\" She heard it in his voice, he was through talking and poised to act. \"Does anyone need anything in there? Medical attention? Water? Maybe something to eat.\"\\n\\n \"I needed my money.\"\\n\\n \"You need your money. Why don\u0027t you tell me about that, Mr. Gradey? Let me see if I can help you with that.\" She wrote down used past.tense.\\n\\n \"I said it all already. Nobody listened.\"\\n\\n \"Nobody listened to you. You sound angry about that. I understand, and I apologize if you feel your problem wasn\u0027t given attention. But I\u0027m listening, Mr. Gradey, I\u0027m listening to you now. I want to help you resolve all this.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s too late. It\u0027s over.\"\\n\\n She heard the gunshot in her head a second before it blasted the air. She\u0027d heard it in his voice.\\n\\n The lawyer had a mild concussion, some bumps and bruises. The secretary was hysterical but unharmed. William Gradey was dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.\\n\\n \"Nice negotiating,\" Arnie said from behind her.\\n\\n She turned, very slowly, until her eyes burned into his. \"You arrogant son of a bitch.\"\\n\\n \"He took himself out while you were on the line. Not me.\" With his trademark smirk in place, Arnie swaggered off.\\n\\n She forced herself not to go after him, not now, not now when her rage was so full and sharp and deep she could-would-do something she\u0027d regret later.\\n\\n It would wait for later. She promised herself that later she would deal with Officer Arnold Meeks. For now, Phoebe stood and watched Crime Scene walk in and out of the building. A hand dropped on her shoulder.\\n\\n \"Nothing more for you to do here,\" Dave said to her.\\n\\n \"I never had a chance with him. A minute, maybe two. It was over before I got here. I couldn\u0027t bring it back.\"\\n\\n \"Phoebe.\"\\n\\n She shook her head. \"Not now, please. I want to debrief the hostages, and take statements from any witnesses.\" She turned around. \"I want all debriefing and statements recorded, and I want you to witness them.\"\\n\\n \"You and I both know sometimes things go south.\"\\n\\n \"What I don\u0027t know is if this one had to.\" The rage wanted to make her tremble. She refused. \"I\u0027m going to find out. The hostages are en route to the hospital, but the woman didn\u0027t seem to be hurt. She can talk. I\u0027d like you to go with me, now, talk to her.\"\\n\\n \"All right. You may want to talk to the counselor. When you lose one-\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t lose him, and that I know.\" She bit off the words, so they both knew how close she was to snapping. \"I never had him.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t speak on the way to the hospital, and Dave didn\u0027t push. In the silence, she stared out the window and outlined the questions she\u0027d ask, the tone she would take, to build the foundation for what she needed to prove.\\n\\n Tracey Percell rested on a gurney in the ER\u0027s exam room. She was young, Phoebe noted, barely old enough to drink. A well-endowed young blonde who needed her roots done.\\n\\n Red-rimmed, swollen eyes were weepy yet as she gnawed on her thumbnail.\\n\\n \"He shot himself. He shot himself right in front of us.\"\\n\\n \"You had a horrible experience. It may help you to talk about it, and it would certainly help us. Do you think you could do that, Tracey?\"\\n\\n \"Okay. I hyperventilated, they said. Passed out. They said I should lie down awhile, but he didn\u0027t hurt me. I\u0027m really lucky he didn\u0027t hurt me. He punched Jasper, and he stuck the gun right in his face. And-\"\\n\\n \"You must\u0027ve been scared.\" Phoebe sat beside the bed, patted Tracey\u0027s hand before she took out her tape recorder. \"Is it all right if I record what we talk about?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. They said they were going to call my boyfriend. Brad? My boyfriend Brad\u0027s going to come.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good. If he doesn\u0027t come before we leave, I\u0027ll check on Brad myself. How\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"Thanks. Thanks.\" Tracey stopped biting her thumbnail as if the mere thought of having her boyfriend come was enough to settle her. \"I feel so weird. Like I watched a scary movie, but I was in it.\"\\n\\n \"I know. But it\u0027s over now. You work for Mr. Hughes?\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. I\u0027m a legal secretary. It\u0027s not much, but it\u0027s okay.\"\\n\\n \"And you went to work today, just like usual.\"\\n\\n \"I go in to open the office at, like, ten to nine. Jasper got in at the same time today. Lots of times he\u0027s later, but we got there right before nine today. We\u0027d barely opened when he came in. Mr. Gradey. He pushed right in the door and punched Jasper in the face. Knocked him down. I screamed because he had the gun. He looked crazy.\" Tracey\u0027s eyes watered again as she snatched out two tissues from the box nested on her lap. \"He looked just crazy.\"\\n\\n \"What happened then?\"\\n\\n \"He said for me to get up and lock the door. He said he\u0027d shoot\\n\\n Jasper dead if I tried to run. He had the gun right to his head, and I was scared; I just did what he said. He said for us to push the desk in front of the door, and when we didn\u0027t move fast enough, I guess, he shot the gun.\"\\n\\n \"He shot at you?\"\\n\\n \"No. He shot it into the floor, put a hole in the carpet. I guess I screamed again, and I was crying. He said to shut the hell up and do what he said. So we did. Then he hit Jasper again and started yelling that he wanted his money. His six thousand five hundred twenty-eight dollars and thirty-six cents. Every penny.\" She started on her thumbnail again. \"Um, I guess you could say Jasper sort of talked him out of the money, for, you know, expenses and costs for this suit. And, um, the suit didn\u0027t really go anywhere.\"\\n\\n \"He was a client?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I guess Jasper didn\u0027t really put him on the books. So to speak.\" Her gaze skidded away. \"I don\u0027t know all the particulars, really.\" \"We\u0027ll get to that later.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. It\u0027d be better if you asked Jasper about all that anyway. Jasper told him he didn\u0027t have the money, and he said Jasper better get it or else. They were talking about going to the bank, then the cop came.\"\\n\\n \"The first officer arrived on scene at that time.\"\\n\\n \"Well, yeah. Sort of. You could hear the sirens, and Mr. Gradey made me go with him to the window and peek through the blinds. Mr. Gradey yelled out something like: \u0027Get the hell away. You try to come in and I\u0027ll kill everybody.\u0027 How he had two people in there and a gun, and he\u0027d use it. Gradey told me to yell out, too, so I did, like, please, he means it.\"\\n\\n She knuckled her eyes. \"Gosh.\"\\n\\n \"You must\u0027ve been scared.\"\\n\\n \"Oh my God, ma\u0027am, I\u0027ve never been so scared in my whole life.\"\\n\\n \"Did Mr. Gradey hurt you then?\"\\n\\n \"No. No. He made me lie down on the floor, on my stomach. Jasper, too. Then the cop, I guess he had one of those what-do-you-call-it? Bullhorns? He called out how he was Officer Arnold Meeks, and how Mr. Gradey was to put down his weapon and come out with his hands up. Right quick, too, he said, like he meant business. And Mr. Gradey, he just yelled back he was William Gradey and we could all go to hell unless he got his six thousand five hundred twenty-eight dollars and thirty-six cents back.\\n\\n \"Then they just yelled at each other awhile.\"\\n\\n \"Yelled at each other?\"\\n\\n \"Yelled and cursed at each other for I don\u0027t know how long. Mr. Gradey wanted to know where the cop was, where the law was when Jasper stole his money. And the cop\u0027s like, \u0027I\u0027m not concerned with your money, and you better get your ass out here, boy, with your hands up.\u0027\" Phoebe glanced at Dave. \"How did Mr. Gradey react to that?\"\\n\\n \"He got really pissed, you know, \u0027specially when the policeman said how Mr. Gradey didn\u0027t have the balls to shoot us. Honest to God, I thought he\u0027d do it then and there just to prove the cop wrong. I couldn\u0027t stop crying.\"\\n\\n \"You heard the policeman say that?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am. Only he didn\u0027t say Mr. Gradey didn\u0027t have the balls, he said \u0027you asshole.\u0027\"\\n\\n Phoebe looked at Dave as Tracey began to shred one of her tissues into bits of fluff. \"And so Mr. Gradey, he told the cop to come on in and get him, and he\u0027d shoot him, and us, too. How he needed his money. He had to sell his car, and he didn\u0027t have anywhere to live, and the cop\u0027s saying he\u0027ll be living in a cell and won\u0027t need a car. After a while, it seemed like a long while, more cops came.\\n\\n \"Do you think Brad\u0027s here yet?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go find out in just a minute. What happened next, Tracey?\"\\n\\n \"Well, Mr. Gradey, he got more upset. I thought, I really thought he was just going to shoot us and get it over with. I started crying again, loud I guess. He told me not to worry, it wasn\u0027t my fault. Cops and lawyers, he said. It was cops and lawyers, and they always fucked over regular people. I think... \"\\n\\n \"What do you think?\" Phoebe prompted.\\n\\n \"I think he was going to let me go on out. I just got the feeling. Me, not Jasper. \u0027Cause he asked if he let me go out, would I tell the cops about the money, and I said I would. Sure I would. Then the phone rang. That cop Meeks yelled for Jasper to answer. \u0027Pick up the phone, you son of a bitch.\u0027\"\\n\\n Tracey let out a sigh. \"I know it sounds stupid, but that policeman scared me about as much as Mr. Gradey and the gun.\" She swiped at her eyes. \"I wish he\u0027d just shut up. I wish he had because I think Mr. Gradey was going to let me go, and maybe he wouldn\u0027t\u0027ve shot himself in the head right in front of me. I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, Tracey. All right now,\" Phoebe soothed as Tracey began to sob.\\n\\n \"It was so awful to see. He said how I could sit up when he was asking me if I\u0027d tell the police about the money. So I was sitting there on the floor when the phone rang and all. I couldn\u0027t hear what the other guy said, but I was watching Mr. Gradey. I was watching and thinking if he lets me go, I\u0027m never coming back to this office. I\u0027ll go back, take some more business courses, get me a better job. Mr. Gradey didn\u0027t say much, but he looked sad. Scared. Sad and scared like I was, and he hung up the phone. Next time it rang, I didn\u0027t think he was going to answer. Then he looked at me and said how he was going to put it on speaker so I could see how y\u0027all treated people like us. So I could see how we didn\u0027t have a chance. There was a woman on this time. It was you,\" Tracey said after a moment. \"Sure, it was you. So you know what happened next.\"\\n\\n \"Yes. I know what happened next.\"\\n\\n Phoebe waited until they were outside, away from people, in the balm of spring air. \"He incited the suicide. He risked the lives of two hostages with his posturing. He ignored procedure, trampled over every guideline of negotiation. And for what?\"\\n\\n \"Not every police officer has negotiation skills, or understands how to handle a hostage situation from that standpoint.\"\\n\\n She rounded on it, couldn\u0027t stop herself. \"Goddamn it, Dave. Are you defending him? Are you, for one second, defending what he did?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" Dave held up a hand. \"And I\u0027m not going to argue with you, Phoebe. Not when you\u0027re right. Officer Meeks will be debriefed.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be debriefing him. It\u0027s my purview,\" she said before Dave could deny.\\n\\n \"And you and Arnie Meeks already have considerable friction. You were on the line with the subject when he terminated.\"\\n\\n \"If I don\u0027t debrief Meeks, it undermines my authority. He didn\u0027t call it in for nearly two hours. Right there, he\u0027s earned a rip. This isn\u0027t a matter of him having a problem with me. It\u0027s a matter of him being a problem, with a badge.\"\\n\\n \"You be careful it doesn\u0027t smell like payback.\"\\n\\n \"A man\u0027s dead. There\u0027s no paying it back.\"\\n\\n Phoebe took her time, in fact took the rest of the long day, to gather statements, information, to write up her notes and complete the incident report.\\n\\n Then she called Arnie into her office. \"I\u0027m going off shift,\" he told her. \"Close the door. Sit down.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m on eight-to-fours. I go past four, I put in the OT.\" But he swaggered over, took a seat. Lifted his jaw at the recorder on her desk. \"What\u0027s this?\"\\n\\n \"This conversation is being recorded for your protection, and mine.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I need my delegate.\"\\n\\n \"If you want your delegate present, you\u0027re free to call him.\" Deliberately, she nudged the phone across the desk toward him. \"Be my guest.\"\\n\\n Arnie shrugged. \"You got five minutes before I start clocking OT.\"\\n\\n \"At oh-nine-eleven this morning you responded to reports of gunfire at the offices of Jasper C. Hughes, Attorney at Law. Is that correct?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"You responded to this location, running hot, approached the building in question. At that time, an individual inside the premises informed you he was armed, with two hostages. Is this correct?\"\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re going to go through the whole report, we\u0027re wasting time.\"\\n\\n \"Did you call for backup or for a negotiation team at that time?\"\\n\\n \"No. I had it handled. Until you got there.\"\\n\\n \"You identified yourself as a police officer, via bullhorn.\"\\n\\n \"I took cover, as procedure, and ID\u0027d myself, sure. I told the guy to put down the gun, to come out. He refused.\"\\n\\n Phoebe sat back. \"You\u0027re right. We\u0027re wasting time. The reports are here, including witness statements, statements from both hostages, statements from the officers who arrived on scene subsequently. Which include the fact that you did not follow procedure, did not call for a negotiation team, did not follow any of the guidelines in hostage negotiation and instead threatened and berated the hostage-taker into an agitated state.\"\\n\\n \"Guy shoots up an office, he\u0027s already in an agitated state.\"\\n\\n \"And there, you\u0027re correct. You never tried to talk him down.\" Though her eyes flashed fury, her voice stayed flat, cold, utterly calm. \"You told him you didn\u0027t care, you told him he was going to jail.\"\\n\\n He sent her that tight, smirking smile. \"Not supposed to lie in negotiations.\" \"You\u0027re going to want to wipe that smirk off your face, Officer. You pushed and you pushed.\" She snatched up a page from a report. \"\u0027Officer Meeks then engaged the subject via telephone and advised the subject he\u0027d be better offjust putting the gun to his head and pulling the trigger.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Reverse psychology. It was under control until you got on the line. Hostages made it out, didn\u0027t they? No loss of life.\"\\n\\n \"There were three people in that office. Only two walked out.\"\\n\\n \"Only two mattered.\"\\n\\n \"In your opinion, yes, which I assume is why you felt entitled to call the hostage-taker a worthless fuck. Although I see nothing in the report that indicates the hostages mattered to you. You never asked for or ascertained their condition, and took actions that endangered their wellbeing including telling the armed hostage-taker he didn\u0027t have the balls to shoot the hostages.\"\\n\\n \"You want to blame somebody for your screwup, ma\u0027am-\"\\n\\n \"My actions will hold up, Officer, I promise you. Yours, on the other hand, don\u0027t. You\u0027re suspended for thirty days.\"\\n\\n He came up out of the chair. \"Bullshit.\"\\n\\n \"The incident will be investigated, as will your actions during it. Meanwhile, you are ordered to report to the departmental psychiatrist for an evaluation within the next seventy-two hours.\"\\n\\n The ugly red spread over his face, as it had in the lecture room. \"You\u0027re not running over me this way.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re free to protest the suspension, but I can tell you you\u0027ll find Captain McVee, who has copies of all statements, in agreement with my decision.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027d agree to flap his wings like a chicken seeing as you\u0027re blowing him.\"\\n\\n She got slowly to her feet. \"What did you say to me?\"\\n\\n \"You think it\u0027s some secret you\u0027re sitting here because you let McVee bang you? We\u0027ll see who\u0027s fucking suspended when I\u0027m done with you. Bitch.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re suspended, thirty days, and the tag for insubordination is going in your jacket. You\u0027re going to want to get out of here, Officer, before you make it worse.\"\\n\\n He stepped to her desk, planted his hands on it, leaned forward. \"It\u0027s going to get worse, for you. That\u0027s a promise.\"\\n\\n She felt the clutch in her throat. \"You\u0027re dismissed. Badge and weapon, Officer.\"\\n\\n His hand moved to his sidearm, his fingers danced over it, and Phoebe saw something in his eyes that told her he was more than just an arrogant son of a bitch.\\n\\n The quick rap on the door had her fighting not to jolt. Sykes poked his head in. \"Sorry to interrupt. I need a minute, Lieutenant, when you\u0027ve got one.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got one. Officer Meeks? I gave you an order.\"\\n\\n He undipped his weapon, tossed it and his badge onto her desk.\\n\\n When he turned and stalked out, Phoebe allowed herself one shuddering breath.\\n\\n \"You okay, LT?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Yes. What do you need?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing. Things looked a little heated in here, that\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. Yeah. Thanks.\" She wanted to sink down in her chair, made herself stand. \"Detective? You\u0027ve been around here a long time.\"\\n\\n \"Twelve years.\"\\n\\n \"Hear a lot of the gossip, the buzz?\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n \"Detective, is it common belief that Captain McVee and I have a sexual relationship?\"\\n\\n He looked so stunned that her stomach instantly smoothed. \"Jesus, Lieutenant, no.\" Sykes closed the door behind him. \"Did that asshole say that?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Let\u0027s leave it inside here, please. Let\u0027s leave the whole thing inside this office.\"\\n\\n \"If that\u0027s what you want.\" Sykes nodded down at Arnie\u0027s badge and gun. \"I\u0027ll say one more thing I\u0027d like to stay in this office. It doesn\u0027t break my heart to see that. You interested in my opinion, between you and me?\"\\n\\n \"I am.
