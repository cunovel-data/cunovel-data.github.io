{"id":75258,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Tears didn\u0027t shame her, not tears that needed to be shed. She was grateful as they poured out, as they washed the worst of the fear and sickness away, that he wasn\u0027t the kind of man who offered awkward pats and told a woman not to cry. He only offered shelter and let her weep. When the shaking eased and the tears slowed, he brushed a light kiss over her bruised temple. \"Any better?\" \"Yes.\" She drew a long breath, and when she let it out, felt her system steady. \"God, yes.\" \"Here\u0027s what we\u0027re going to do. I\u0027m going to go fix you something to drink, then you\u0027re going to tell me what happened.\" He lifted her face until their eyes met. \"Then we\u0027ll figure out what comes next.\" \"Okay.\" \"I don\u0027t have a thing... a handkerchief.\" \"I\u0027ve got tissues in my bag.\" \"Good, then...\" He shifted her, sat her down beside him. \"If you need, you know, the bathroom? There\u0027s one that way and to the right.\" no I \"Good idea.\" When he left her, she sat for a moment, drawing back the reserves. She got achingly to her feet, picked up the purse he\u0027d left on the coffee table, then made her way under graceful arches, over polished floors to the powder room. The first glimpse of her face in the long oval mirror had her moaning as much in vanity as distress. Her eyes were puffy and red, with the right one sporting an ugly mottle of bruises, accented by the hard black smear of gathering blood under it. Her jaw was another swollen cloudburst, her bottom lip about double in size and split. The butterfly bandages on her forehead closed the jagged gash, and stood out starkly against the raw, scraped skin. \"This isn\u0027t a beauty contest, Phoebe, so get over yourself. But God, God, could you look any worse?\" And when she took this face home, she was going to scare everyone half stupid. Nothing to be done about that, nothing, she reminded herself, and carefully dabbed cold water over her face. In short order, she discovered that even the elemental task of peeing with a bruised hip and an arm in a sling was an exercise in discomfort and frustration. That tidying herself up brought everything to a dull throb under the layer of medication. And vanity or no vanity, she was already sick and tired of looking as if she\u0027d run headlong into a brick wall. Plus, she hated hobbling. As she hobbled her way back into the parlor, Duncan set a tray on the coffee table. \"I don\u0027t know what they gave you in the ER, so I figured alcohol was off the menu. You got tea-and my personal remedy for a black eye, and so on, a bag of frozen peas.\" She stopped. \"You made tea.\" \"You don\u0027t like tea?\" \"Of course I do. You made tea, and in a pretty teapot, on a tray. And brought me frozen peas.\" She held up her good hand. \"My emotions are all over the board yet. I\u0027m getting weepy because somebody made me tea in a pot, and thought to offer me frozen peas.\" \"Good thing I didn\u0027t bake cookies.\" She picked up the bag of peas, held it to the side of her face that suffered the most damage. \"Can you?\" \"I have no idea. Anyway, I wasn\u0027t sure if you\u0027d be able to chew anything yet. How\u0027s that jaw?\" She walked, slowly, to the divan, sat again. \"You want me stoic, or you want the truth?\" \"I\u0027ll take the truth.\" \"It fucking hurts, that\u0027s how it is. I think there might be one square inch of my body that doesn\u0027t fucking hurt. And that makes you smile?\" He kept smiling. \"That you\u0027re hurting, no. That you\u0027re pissed off about it, yes. Good to see your temper\u0027s in working order.\" He sat beside her, poured out the tea. \"Tell me what happened, Phoebe.\" \"I got jumped in the stairwell at work.\" \"Jumped? Who?\" \"I didn\u0027t see him, so I can\u0027t say for sure. He was waiting for me,\" she began, and told him. He didn\u0027t interrupt, but when she spoke of her assailant tearing her clothes, Duncan pushed off the couch. As she had when she\u0027d first entered the room, he walked to the doors, stared out. And she stopped speaking. \"Go on,\" he said with his back to her. \"I just can\u0027t sit right now.\" He listened, and he stared through the glass. He didn\u0027t see the wild wisteria or the winding trails of the side garden. He saw a dim stairwell, he saw Phoebe hurt and helpless, struggling while some faceless bastard tore at her, pawed at her, terrorized her. There had to be payment, Duncan thought. He believed strongly in payment. \"You know who it was,\" he said when she\u0027d finished. \"I didn\u0027t see him.\" Duncan turned now. His face was cool and blank so that the blue of his eyes burned all the stronger against it. \"You know who it was.\" \"I have a strong suspicion. Suspicion isn\u0027t proof.\" \"That\u0027s the cop talking. What about the person?\" \"I know who did it, and I\u0027m going to find a way to prove it. Do you think I would take this? Do you think that\u0027s who I am?\" She held up a hand as if stopping herself. \"No, go on. A good pissing rage is as healing as a good cry.\" \"He hurt me. That fucking bastard. He hurt and humiliated me. He made me think he\u0027d kill me and leave my baby an orphan and my mother, my family grieving. He left me to crawl away naked, to crawl with most of my clothes torn away where I work, where I have to go every day and face the people who saw what he could do to me. And do you know why?\" \"No. Why?\" \"Because he couldn\u0027t stand taking orders from me. He couldn\u0027t stand having authority, female authority especially, disciplining him and setting out the consequences for his actions.\" \"Are you telling me another cop did this to you?\" Shocked that so much had spewed out of her, she pulled herself back. \"I have strong suspicions.\" \"What\u0027s his name?\" The woman inside, the one who had been hurt and humiliated, warmed just a little at the tone. The tone that said, very clearly, I\u0027ll handle this. But she shook her head. \"Don\u0027t get out the white charger, Duncan. This\u0027ll be dealt with. He\u0027ll be dealt with. It\u0027s now my mission in life to make sure of it. And having this time, this place to... well, to be, it\u0027s helped more than I can tell you.\" \"Well, that\u0027s fine and good for you, and glad to be of assistance. But that\u0027s not much help for me when I\u0027m in the mood to pound somebody\u0027s face in like it was rotten wood, then twist his useless dick off and feed it to the dog I keep thinking about getting.\" \"No,\" Phoebe said after a long moment. \"No, I don\u0027t guess it is. I\u0027m going to confess that I find myself surprisingly comforted, and just a little aroused, by the sentiment.\" \"I don\u0027t know what this is yet, this you-and-me thing. I didn\u0027t figure I had to think about it all that much as yet. So putting that asidewhatever this is or isn\u0027t here, you should know my natural inclination, and you go right ahead and consider it sexist or outdated or whatever the hell you like-my natural inclination when some cowardly son of a bitch beats on a woman is to get out that goddamn white charger and kick some ass.\" He could, she realized. She\u0027d let that one slip by her. But looking at him now, with that hot rage burning straight through the cold fury, she understood there was a great deal more to him than charm and luck. \"Okay, I hear your natural inclination is to defend and to act, and you sound-\" \"Don\u0027t pull that negotiator crap out on me.\" \"That would be my natural inclination,\" she returned. \"My next is to say I don\u0027t need protection, but given the circumstances, that would be a stupid thing to say. Most of my life I\u0027ve been the one protecting and defending, and that goes back long before I had a badge. I\u0027m not quite sure how to react when someone wants to protect and defend me.\" He walked over to her, hesitated, then leaned down. \"I\u0027m going to be careful about this, but you let me know if it hurts.\" And he laid his lips, very gently, on hers. \"It doesn\u0027t.\" He kissed her again before straightening. \"You\u0027ve got a week.\" \"Sorry?\" \"You got a week to complete your current mission in life. Then I get a name, and I help myself.\" \"If that\u0027s some sort of ultimatum-\" \"It\u0027s not, not at all. It\u0027s just fact.\" Sitting on the coffee table across from her, he took the peas she\u0027d lowered, turned the bag over, and put the cooler side against her swollen jaw. \"I already know it was a cop, and one you had to slap back for something. I expect I could have a name inside an hour. But you have a week to do it your way.\" \"You think because you have money-\" \"No, Phoebe, I know because I have money.\" Gently, he lifted her hands, in turn, touched his lips to her bandaged wrists, comforting even as he laid down the law. \"It oils the wheels, and that\u0027s just another fact. You\u0027re smart, and you\u0027ve got that purpose that just sets me off. I\u0027m betting you\u0027ll have this bastard frying inside that week. If not, well, my turn.\" \"Your turn? This is a police matter, and it has nothing to do with turns. That\u0027s grade school.\" He smiled at her, just enough to have the dimple flickering. \"You know, you look like hell right now.\" \"Excuse me?\" \"What I\u0027m saying is, you look pretty damn awful, your face all banged up that way. Even with the Grey\u0027s Anatomy thing going with the scrubs, you look like hell. So, why it should be I can look at you right now and still be attracted right down to the soles of my feet is a goddamn puzzle. But I am.\" Torn in a dozen directions, she dumped the frozen peas on the tea tray. \"What the hell does that have to do with this?\" \"Nothing. It just popped into my head. Want some more tea? And yeah,\" he added when she just stared at him, \"that\u0027s a change of subject. Your mind\u0027s made up; mine is, too. So what\u0027s the point of arguing about it when neither of us is going to budge on the issue? And you can\u0027t be feeling your best, so I don\u0027t feel right fighting with you.\" \"No, I don\u0027t want any more tea, thanks. And you\u0027re right, I\u0027m not feeling my best, but it\u0027s important that you understand there\u0027s a wide difference between retribution and the law.\" \"We\u0027ll have to debate that some other time, when you\u0027re back at full power. You want to take a whirlpool? Hot water, jets? It might help with some of the aches.\" Another thing she\u0027d let slip by, she thought, was the man had a head like a rock. \"That\u0027s a nice offer, but no. I\u0027m going to need to get home.\" And the thought of that had her looking down at herself. \"God.\" \"Do you want to call them first? Prepare them?\" \"No. No, then they\u0027d just worry until I got there. I\u0027m putting you out again, Duncan, having you drive me all the way back.\" \"So, you\u0027ll owe me.\" He helped her out to the car. Even the short walk wore her out, so she just sat, out of breath, while he strapped her in. Carly would be coming in from school any minute, she thought as he drove toward home. Mama would be finishing up taking her Internet orders for the day, or boxing up completed pieces to go out in the mail in the morning. Ava, likely home from errands, would be fussing around in the kitchen. Just an easy Monday afternoon. And she was about to shatter it. \"Who plays the piano?\" \"Nobody. I sort of do. Just by ear. I always thought a piano added class to a room.\" \"Cousin Bess insisted Carter and I take lessons. I got the mechanics of it; Carter got the heart.\" She let her head fall back. \"I wish this part was over. The shocking them, the explaining it all again part. I wish it was over.\" \"I can explain what happened for you, if you want.\" \"I have to do it. Where\u0027s your family, Duncan?\" It occurred to her that nowhere in the rooms she\u0027d been in in the grand house had she seen any photos of family. \"Here and there.\" \"Long story?\" \"Epic. We\u0027ll save it for another time.\" Her cell phone rang, and with some effort she reached for her purse and pulled it out. \"This is Phoebe. Yes, Dave, I\u0027m all right, I\u0027m better. No, I\u0027m on my way home now. I\u0027ve been with a friend. Could be worse.\" She listened awhile. \"I understand. I\u0027ll be in tomorrow to- Sir. Captain. Dave.\" She let out a frustrated breath. \"Two days then. Three. Yes, sir, thank you. And I\u0027d like the sit-down rescheduled for Thursday, if possible. I appreciate that. I will. Yes, I will. Bye.\" \"Okay?\" Duncan asked. \"Not entirely, but better than it could\u0027ve been. He was going to order me to take medical leave for two weeks.\" \"The bastard.\" She let out a laugh, then sucked air as it pinged her ribs. \"I\u0027d go crazy sitting home having Mama and Ava fuss over me for two weeks. He knows that. I\u0027ll heal better if I\u0027m working, and it makes a statement where a statement needs to be made. He knows that, too. He was probably after the three or four days all along. He\u0027s a sneaky son of a bitch.\" \"Sounds like somebody I\u0027d like.\" \"Probably. He got away with my weapon.\" \"What? Captain Dave?\" \"No. No, not the captain. Sorry, this whole thing\u0027s scrambled my brain so I can\u0027t seem to think in a straight line.\" The cop who\u0027d hurt her, Duncan realized. And since she was busy brooding over it, he gave her room. Just as he gave her room to be agitated as they approached Jones Street. \"Want a bourbon and a cigarette first?\" \"Don\u0027t think I wouldn\u0027t. I\u0027m about to take on multiple hysterical females.\" She prepared herself with deep breaths as he drove down the brick-paved street. \"Oh God. That just caps it.\" \"What?\" Duncan shot her a glance, saw her fit on a stoic smile. Then saw the man who\u0027d been strolling along in the dappled sunlight break into a run. \"Phoebe! Phoebe, what happened?\" The man wrenched the door open, reached down. \"My God, what happened to you? Who are you?\" He threw the words at Duncan like stones. \"What the hell did you do to my sister?\" \"Carter, stop! Stop. He didn\u0027t do a thing but help me.\" \"Who hurt you? Where is he?\" People strolled along Jones-residents and tourists-and now, Phoebe noted, any number of those strollers had stopped to stare at the beat-up woman and the two men on either side of a flashy white Porsche. \"You can stop shouting on a public street like a lunatic. Let\u0027s go inside.\" \"They\u0027re good questions.\" Duncan came around to the passenger seat. \"I\u0027d like the answers, too. I\u0027m Duncan. She\u0027s got a lot of tender spots. We\u0027ll need to be careful-\" \"I can take care of her.\" \"Carter, stop it. Do you want to add to the extremely crappy day I\u0027ve had by being rude to a friend? I apologize for my ill-mannered brother, Duncan.\" \"No problem.\" \"Oh God, there\u0027s Miz Tiffany and that ridiculous dog heading over from the park. I can\u0027t deal with that. Carter, for the love of God, don\u0027t make me deal with that. Help me get inside.\" \"Easy does it,\" Duncan advised, and caught a glimpse of a woman, well past a certain age, with a blond bubble of hair, being led by a tiny, apparently hairless dog wearing a polka-dot tie. \"She hasn\u0027t seen you yet. I\u0027d be ill mannered, too, by the way, in your place,\" he told Carter as they got Phoebe to the sidewalk. \"Still, under any circumstances, when I bring a woman home, I take her to the door.\" Resigned to it, Phoebe allowed herself to be flanked, then all but carried up the steps. And with the overture complete, she thought, Here comes the show. When the door opened, Essie was already on her way down the hall. \"I thought I heard you shouting, Carter. I... Phoebe! Oh my God.\" She went white as paste, swayed. \"Let me go,\" Phoebe murmured, then hurried forward. \"Mama. I\u0027m all right, Mama. Breathe for me. I\u0027m all right, I\u0027m home. Carter, go get her some water.\" \"No, no.\" Still ghostly pale, Essie lifted a hand to Phoebe\u0027s cheek. \"Baby girl.\" \"I\u0027m all right.\" \"Your face. Reuben-\" \"Is dead, Mama. You know that.\" \"Yes. Yes. I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m sorry. Oh, Phoebe. What happened? Your face, your arm. Ava!\" She\u0027d snapped back, Phoebe noted. Still white as a sheet, but she\u0027d snapped back. Ava rushed out from the back of the house. And there was, for the next several minutes, a mass of confusion, voices, movement, tears. Duncan closed the front door, stood back. He\u0027d always figured if you can\u0027t help, stay out of the way. \"All right, stop now.\" He could hear Phoebe\u0027s voice, very calm, very firm, through the melee. She repeated the same order, once, then twice. And on the third, the words snapped out-a kind of verbal slap to the face-and shocked her family into silence. \"I\u0027ll explain everything, but right now I want everybody to just stop talking at once. I\u0027ve been banged up, which is obvious, and all this badgering isn\u0027t helping. Now-\" \"Mama.\" As the verbal slap had shut down the hysteria, so did the single, quivering word stop what Duncan assumed might have been an irritated rant. Phoebe turned toward the little girl who stood holding a bright red ball. \"I\u0027m all right, Carly. I know I don\u0027t look it, but I am. I will be. I got hurt, but I\u0027m okay.\" \"Mama.\" The ball went bouncing away as Carly ran forward to grab Phoebe, to press her face against her mother\u0027s waist. From his vantage point, Duncan saw the ripple of pain, and the way it leached all color out of Phoebe\u0027s cheeks. \"Hey, sorry. I know this is a bad time, but, you know, I think Phoebe needs to lie down.\" He moved forward as he spoke and simply lifted Phoebe off her feet. \"Carly, maybe you could show me where your mama\u0027s bedroom is.\" \"It\u0027s upstairs.\" \"I can walk. Duncan, I can walk.\" \"Sure, but hey, I already got you. Miz MacNamara? They gave Phoebe some medication. I think it might be time for her to take it, if she had some water.\" \"Of course, of course.\" \"I\u0027ll get it.\" Ava touched Essie\u0027s arm. \"You go up with Phoebe. I\u0027ll get the water, and some ice. Carter, help me get some ice for Phoebe.\" \"I\u0027m going up to fix the bed. I\u0027m going right up to get it ready.\" Essie dashed up the stairs. \"Did you fall?\" Carry\u0027s voice still shook as she walked up beside Duncan, with her fingers closed over the hem of the scrubs. \"That was part of it. I had a bad fall, and I had to go to the hospital. They fixed me up and let me come home. You know they don\u0027t let you go home if you\u0027re not fixed enough. Right?\" \"Is your arm broken?\" \"No. It\u0027s just hurt, so it\u0027s in this sling for a while so I don\u0027t bump it around.\" \"How come you didn\u0027t catch her when she fell?\" Carly demanded of Duncan. \"I wish I could have. I wasn\u0027t there when she fell.\" He carried Phoebe into the bedroom where Essie had already turned down the spread, fluffed the pillows. \"Just lay her right on down. Thank you so much, Duncan. Phoebe, I\u0027m sorry, I just lost my head.\" \"It\u0027s all right, Mama. Everything\u0027s going to be all right.\" \"Of course it is.\" Though her lips quivered visibly, Essie sent Carly a big smile. \"We\u0027re going to take good care of your mama, aren\u0027t we? She needs some medicine now.\" \"It\u0027s in my purse. I-\" \"Right here.\" Duncan set it on the bed. \"You\u0027re good with details,\" Phoebe commented. \"Wouldn\u0027t you like to go down and sit in the parlor, Duncan?\" Essie began. \"Carter, he\u0027ll fix you a drink. And...\" She rubbed her fingers on her temple. \"And you\u0027ll stay for dinner. You\u0027ll stay for dinner, of course.\" \"That\u0027s nice of you, but I\u0027ll leave y\u0027all to tend to Phoebe. I hope I can have a rain check.\" \"You\u0027re welcome anytime. Anytime at all. I\u0027ll walk you down.\" \"You stay right here.\" He gave Essie\u0027s shoulder a pat before he looked down at Phoebe. \"That goes for you, too.\" \"I think I\u0027m going to do just that. Duncan-\" \"We\u0027ll talk later.\" As he left, Carter bounded up the stairs. Carter stopped, gripping a pair of ice bags. \"Sorry about jumping on you out there.\" \"Forget it. Natural.\" \"Do you know who punched my sister in the face? I took enough fists in the face to know what the results look like,\" he said when Duncan lifted his brows. \"I don\u0027t know who hurt her, but I\u0027m going to find out.\" \"When you do-if it\u0027s before I do-I want to know.\" \"Sure.\" \"Carter MacNamara.\" Carter shifted ice bags, held out a hand. \"Duncan Swift. See you around.\" Duncan let himself out, glanced up toward the bedroom window as he walked to his car. Gorgeous house, he thought, and just full of problems. He had enough experience with problems to know they came in all flavors and varieties. Just as he knew, without question, that whatever the problems, Phoebe was the glue that held the family together. Gift or burden? he wondered. And decided it was probably a good chunk of both. A smart man would drive away from the gorgeous house with its va riety of problems. Drive away and keep on going. That\u0027s what a smart man would do. Then again, Duncan thought, there were times it was more interesting, and certainly more rewarding, just to be dumb. He ended up at a bar. The after-work crowd wouldn\u0027t flood into Slam Dune for nearly an hour, so despite the multiple flat screens rolling out ESPN, and the scatter of customers playing pool or air hockey, Duncan figured it was quiet enough for a meeting. Anyway, he wanted a beer, and felt after the afternoon he\u0027d put in, he\u0027d earned it. He kept an eye out for Phin, and when he saw his friend come in, Duncan signaled the bar. \"Already ordered you a Corona, and some nachos.\" Phin slid into the booth. \"Left me hanging today.\" \"I know, I\u0027m sorry. Couldn\u0027t be helped. What do you figure?\" Phin puffed out his cheeks. \"Jake, who you also left hanging as he got there two minutes after you split, did a walk-through. He\u0027s going to work up a detailed estimate of what it\u0027ll cost you to do what you want with the building. But his eyeball opinion? You\u0027re going to have to sink minimum of one-point-five into it, over and above the cost.\" \"Okay.\" Phin leaned back as the nachos slid between them and the waiter set the Corona with its slice of lime on the table. \"You ever look back, wonder how we got to be sitting here talking about a million and a half dollars like it was pocket change?\" \"How much did that suit cost?\" Phin grinned, picked up his beer. \"Fine-looking suit, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Dude, you\u0027re my fashion god. Figure two for the overhaul; let\u0027s not be pikers. Add in what I\u0027ll pay that squirrel for the property.\" \"Does look like a squirrel,\" Phin commented. \"Maybe he\u0027ll take some of the buy money and spring for a decent toupee. Anyhow... Got a pen?\" Phin took a Mont Blanc out of his inside jacket pocket. \"Why don\u0027t you ever have a damn pen?\" \"Where am I going to put it? And you always have one.\" Duncan scribbled figures on a napkin. And that said it all, Phin thought. The man might look like your average guy-the worn jeans, the untucked, rolled-up-at-the-sleeves shirt, the hair begging for a trim. He might come across to most as an extraordinarily lucky guy who happened to pick the right numbers at the right time. Appearances didn\u0027t mean dick when it came to Duncan Swift. He\u0027d use that borrowed pen and a napkin to figure out cost runs, overlay, buffer, outlay and potential income. He\u0027d do it while eating nachos and drinking a beer, and by the time he was done, he\u0027d have his projected cost and future returns figured as close to the mark as any fleet of accountants. The man had a knack, Phin decided as he-with care-transferred some loaded nachos from platter to plate. \"Where\u0027d you take off to?\" \"That\u0027s something I want to talk to you about. Or more specifically, with your lovely wife.\" \"Loo\u0027s in court.\" Duncan glanced up, over, and smiled. \"Not now, she\u0027s not.\" She wore a conservative blue suit that managed to showcase her mile-long legs. Her sexy curls were tamed back into a clip so that her sharp cheekbones, deep brown eyes, wide mouth were subtly framed. Her skin was the color of rich caramel. Duncan always wondered how any judge or jury could look at that face and not give her whatever she wanted. Duncan slid out of the booth, wrapped his arms around her and spoke into her ear just loud enough for Phin to hear. \"Dump him. I\u0027ll buy you Fiji.\" She had a big, strong laugh, and let it rip. \"Can I just keep him to play with when you\u0027re busy?\" \"Give me back my wife.\" \"Not done with her.\" Taking his time with it, Duncan gave her a long, dramatic kiss. \"That\u0027ll hold me. Thanks for coming, Loo.\" \"Thought you were in court.\" \"I was.\" She sat next to Phin, nuzzled her lips to his. \"Prosecution asked for a recess. I\u0027ve got them on the ropes. Now, which of you handsome men is going to buy me a martini?\" \"Being shaken even as we speak. One minute. Here\u0027s what we\u0027ll offer the squirrel and here\u0027s where we top off.\" Duncan pushed the napkin over to Phin. \"Okay?\" Phin glanced at the figures, shrugged. \"It\u0027s your money.\" \"Yeah. Isn\u0027t that a kick in the ass?\" Duncan picked up his beer. He knew Phin and Loo would be holding hands under the table. They had the thing, the it, whatever that it was that locked people together and kept them damn happy about it. \"Y\u0027all want something more than nachos?\" Duncan asked them. \"Just that martini. As our gorgeous and brilliant offspring is spending the night with her cousin, I\u0027m going to have this fine-looking man take me out to dinner.\" \"Are you?\" \"I am, but not until I\u0027ve had that drink and am finished playing footsie with my lover here.\" Loo winked at Duncan. \"So, baby doll, what can I do for you?\" Duncan said nothing for a moment, then grinned. \"Sorry, my mind went in all sorts of interesting directions.\" He listened to that terrific laugh of hers again. \"It\u0027s about something that happened to a friend of mine today, and my curiosity over what gets done to the guy who did it when he gets caught.\" \"Criminal or civil?\" \"It\u0027s pretty fucking criminal.\" Loo raised her eyebrows at the tone, then accepted the martini she was served. She took the first, slow sip. \"Should this individual be charged and indicted, I take it you\u0027d object if I or my firm represent him.\" \"I can\u0027t tell you what to do, but I figured you\u0027d know the ins and outs of what he might try to pull, legally, when they get him.\" \"Not if, but when.\" She broke off a minute corner of a chip. \"Okay, tell me what this man allegedly did.\" \"Before I tell you what he did, I\u0027d better tell you, he\u0027s a cop.\" \"Oh. Well. Shit.\" Loo blew out a breath, drank again. \"Tell me.\" Interesting. From his seat at the bar, he nursed a beer, ate some cheese fries and pretended to be interested in the reports on March Madness that dominated the near screen. He had a perfect view of the booth where Phoebe\u0027s screw-buddy sat with the duded-up black couple. Interesting, damn interesting-and fortunate that he himself had been watching the house on Jones when the fancy car pulled up. Phoebe hadn\u0027t been looking so good. He had to smother a laugh he knew might draw attention his way. No sir, the redheaded bitch hadn\u0027t been looking her best. She was going to be looking worse before it was over. But for now, he\u0027d take a little time, a little trouble, to find who Mr. Fancy Car and his friends were. You never knew who might be useful.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/high-noon/page-8.html","bookId":2412,"book":{"id":2412,"title":"High Noon","description":"Storyline: Police Lieutenant Phoebe MacNamara found her calling at an early age when an unstable man broke into her family\u0027s home, trapping and terrorizing them for hours. Now she\u0027s Savannah\u0027s top hostage negotiator, defusing powderkeg situations with a talent for knowing when to give in-and when to jump in and take action. It\u0027s satisfying work-and sometimes those skills come in handy at home dealing with her agoraphobic mother, still traumatized by the break-in after all these years, and her precocious seven-year-old, Carly. It\u0027s exactly that heady combination of steely courage and sensitivity that first attracts Duncan Swift to Phoebe. After observing her coax one of his employees down from a roof ledge, he is committed to keeping this intriguing, take-charge woman in his life. She\u0027s used to working solo, but Phoebe\u0027s discovering that no amount of negotiation can keep Duncan at arm\u0027s length. And when she\u0027s grabbed by a man who throws a hood over her head and brutally assaults her-in her own precinct house-Phoebe can\u0027t help but be deeply shaken. Then threatening messages show up on her doorstep, and she\u0027s not just alarmed but frustrated. How do you go face-to-face with an opponent who refuses to look you in the eye? Now, with Duncan backing her up every step of the way, she must establish contact with the faceless tormentor who is determined to make her a hostage to fear . . . before she becomes the final showdown.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/high-noon.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/high-noon.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:15 AM"}}
