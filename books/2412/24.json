{"id":75274,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"She put it away, locked up the turmoil that seeing, hearing, watching Arnie Meeks had made swirl inside her. No time, no place for it now. It would come back, she knew, spurting up to twist her belly into knots. When it did, she\u0027d just have to find a way to uncoil them until there was time, until there was a place.\\n\\n She had a whole checklist of priorities ahead of that one.\\n\\n On Jones, she parked, got out of the car. Why, she wondered, did the house seem to loom sometimes? She could go weeks, even months, without thinking of it as anything but home-a beautiful, graceful place to raise her child, to house her mother, her friend. A place to eat, sleep, live, even entertain occasionally.\\n\\n What did it matter that she hadn\u0027t chosen to live there, to be there? In the end, it was only a house. Only brick and glass. Cousin Bess\u0027s ghost had long since moved on.\\n\\n Lack of choice, she thought. It was all about choice, and not having options.\\n\\n Despite the fact she was needed inside, Phoebe walked around to the courtyard gate. Away from the police car, away from that looming face of brick and glass.\\n\\n Here, at least, there\u0027d been choices, even if she\u0027d left them almost entirely up to Ava. Gardens and paths and shady nooks, graceful tables, whimsical statuary.\\n\\n She sat on the steps of the veranda, looked out, and imagined that lovely courtyard somewhere else. New Orleans maybe, or just another street in Savannah. Could be Atlanta or Charlotte.\\n\\n And what difference, really, at the base of things?\\n\\n All the difference, she admitted. All the difference in the world. She heard the door open but didn\u0027t turn. So much, she thought, for solo brooding time.\\n\\n Carter sat beside her, put a glass of wine in her hand. And said nothing at all.\\n\\n She took the first sip in silence, with only the elegant music of the fountain trickling through. \"I\u0027m having a sulk.\"\\n\\n \"Hence the wine. Want me to go back in?\"\\n\\n \"No. I decided to pick at an old scab. Cousin Bess, this house and the locks she put on the door I can\u0027t open. Nothing to do about it, so it\u0027s a good one to sulk about as I don\u0027t have to find the solution.\"\\n\\n \"Which in every other instance you do.\" She looked at him. \"It\u0027s what I do, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s what you\u0027ve taken on, almost as long as I can remember.\\n\\n Reuben was the big demarcation, but there was stuff before that. In the blurry before time.\"\\n\\n She leaned her head against his shoulder a moment. \"Everything changed when Daddy died. For me, before that\u0027s the blurry time. She could\u0027ve helped us then, you know. Cousin Bitch. There might not\u0027ve been a Reuben if she\u0027d done the right thing by Mama then. But she didn\u0027t, and there\u0027s no point speculating on what might\u0027ve been.\"\\n\\n She sat silent awhile, drinking wine, studying the fountain. \"Mama came through for us, every day.\"\\n\\n \"I know it.\"\\n\\n \"It must\u0027ve been so hard. When I think about it, I can\u0027t fully imagine what it was like for her. The worry, the work, the grief. The fear. But she always came through for us. Then, she takes a chance on someone who makes her think she\u0027s special, and who starts off treating her so well. And it nearly kills her and her children. Hardly a wonder she started closing doors.\"\\n\\n \"I never blamed her for that.\"\\n\\n \"No, no, you never have, and sometimes I do. God, it shames me that sometimes I do. It doesn\u0027t matter what I know, sometimes it just pisses me off she won\u0027t walk outside, go down to the market, go to the damn movies. Anything. It doesn\u0027t matter I know she can\u0027t. Sometimes...\"\\n\\n She shook her head, took another sip of wine. \"I think about now, this situation, and how I can\u0027t send her and Carly away somewhere. I wouldn\u0027t have to worry so much if I could put them on a plane to anywhere else until this is over.\"\\n\\n \"We need to talk to her about therapy again. Not now,\" he said before Phoebe could answer. \"Not when she\u0027s already tied up. But later, when... like you said, this is over. Josie and I could move in. Not just temporarily.\"\\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t be happy.\"\\n\\n \"Phoebe-\"\\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t. And I am happy here, most of the time. I\u0027m just having a champion pissy spell. I got all these wires crossed in me right now. Arnold Meeks is clear on Roy. I knew that before I went down there to observe. But observing got me twisted up and mad and scared all over again. I\u0027d rather be pissed than scared, so I\u0027m out here concentrating on that part.\"\\n\\n \"Doing a good job.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the important thing.\"\\n\\n Across the courtyard a hummingbird, bright as a jewel, flirted with the riot of morning glories climbing the iron trellis against the wall.\\n\\n Free to choose any blossom, Phoebe thought, free to fly on. People weren\u0027t birds.\\n\\n \"How\u0027s Mama?\"\\n\\n \"Crocheting. Before he left, Duncan had her working on ideas for stock and cost analysis. God knows. Just the right thing to keep her mind off all this. He\u0027s good at that. Working people.\"\\n\\n She lifted her eyebrows. \"Compliment or complaint?\"\\n\\n \"I like him. He got Carly in on the discussion about stock. Fashion consultant. She was completely into it.\"\\n\\n \"As a future personal shopper should be.\"\\n\\n \"Knowing what buttons to push, well, that\u0027s a talent, and he\u0027s got it in spades. How and when and where you push them shows what you\u0027re made of, to my way of thinking. So yeah, Phoebs, I like him just fine.\"\\n\\n \"I more than like him fine.\"\\n\\n \"Oh. Really?\" Eyes narrowed now, Carter took a long look at her face. \"And that worries you because?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t say I was worried.\"\\n\\n He rolled his eyes, then tapped a finger on the faint line dug in between her brows. \"Right there says you are.\"\\n\\n She shrugged, then rubbed the line away. \"Come on, Carter. Crappy track record.\"\\n\\n \"Roy was a jerk. Everyone\u0027s entitled to screw up with a jerk once. And I\u0027m sorry I said that, sort of, because I just remembered he\u0027s dead. Still.\"\\n\\n \"A jerk, dead or alive. True. Crappy track record,\" she repeated. \"Demanding career that often messes up personal plans.\"\\n\\n \"A guy\u0027s dating a cop, he\u0027s got to figure on that already. I don\u0027t buy either worry. Sorry. Try again.\"\\n\\n \"A seven-year-old daughter. I\u0027m not saying she\u0027s a problem or a worry. She happens to be the love of my life. But she\u0027s a factor. Her happiness is first. And forging a serious, lasting relationship with someone when they have to accept someone else\u0027s child as part of the package is tricky.\"\\n\\n Carter flicked that away with his fingers. \"People do it every day. Several times a day. I could do a Google search and get you stats.\"\\n\\n \"They do, but those people aren\u0027t me, or Carly, or Duncan for that matter. Add in this house. He has this fabulous place out on Whitfield Island. He built it. I couldn\u0027t-say if things went to a much higher level-ever live there. I can\u0027t move. And there\u0027s Mama. Take me on, take her on, too.\\n\\n \"Now, maybe one of those factors isn\u0027t such a deal, just one thin string. But add them all up, that\u0027s a big, messy ball of sticky twine. And tying it all up? I don\u0027t know if he more than likes me fine.\" I\\n\\n \"Could ask him.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, easy for you to say. You man you.\" She blew out a breath. \"Well, I\u0027ve succeeded in depressing myself on that score, which has nicely distracted me from my brood, which distracted me from this horrible situation. Now it\u0027s time to leapfrog back to horrible situation.\" She got to her feet. \"I need to work awhile.\" She leaned down, kissed Carter\u0027s cheek. \"Thanks for the wine, and the rest.\"\\n\\n \"It was your wine but the rest is always available.\"\\n\\n It could have been worse, Phoebe thought. With Ava and Josie huddled in the kitchen and her mother and her daughter closeted with designs and yarns, Phoebe had a solid chunk of time to work undisturbed.\\n\\n For a house under siege, she decided, theirs was clicking along at a remarkably normal pace.\\n\\n In the morning, she thought, she\u0027d contact the FBI, relay the situation and request copies of files where she was a part of a crisis team. Long time gone, she mused as she opened more current files. But she\u0027d take no chances.\\n\\n Every case file she read took her flying back. Amazing, she realized, how every detail popped clear. Four years, five, it didn\u0027t matter how long ago. Once the log was in front of her, she remembered.\\n\\n Suicides, domestic disputes, robberies gone wrong, custody battles, embittered employees, revenge, financial gain, grief, mental or emotional instability. Any and all could and did arrow toward hostages.\\n\\n And sometimes, no matter what was done, negotiations failed. She failed.\\n\\n She organized by year, and started with the first year she joined the Savannah police.\\n\\n By the end of that year she\u0027d lost three. One suicide, one hostage and one hostage-taker. It didn\u0027t matter that there\u0027d been dozens more she\u0027d talked down, or talked out. She\u0027d lost three, and now each was fresh in her mind.\\n\\n So fresh she began second-guessing the steps she\u0027d taken, the words she\u0027d spoken, the tone used. Too long a pause-not enough of one. Fruitless to do so, she knew. Even dangerous.\\n\\n Still, three lives had slipped out of her hands. Was Roy dead because of one of them?\\n\\n She started a fresh file with the names of the dead, the year, the place, the nature of the crisis. Then began to chart the names of those connected to them personally, professionally. And added the names of team members.\\n\\n She was halfway through the second year when Ava gave her doorjamb a knuckle rap. \"You\u0027ve got to come up for air. And a meal.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine, Ava. Promise.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not. None of us are. But we need to breathe and eat and sleep.\" She crossed to the desk. \"Your mother and your daughter need to see you doing those things, even if it\u0027s only for a bit here and there.\"\\n\\n \"All right, I\u0027ll come down. Ava, I know you\u0027re planning to take a couple weeks with Steven out West later in the summer. I was thinking you ought to bump that up. The semester\u0027s over in just a few days anyway. You could head on out, hook up with him early, then-\"\\n\\n \"Be out of harm\u0027s way, if by any chance I\u0027m in it? Seeing as we\u0027re all stuck in this house for however long that might be, it\u0027s pretty shortsighted of you to make me mad on day one.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not trying to make you mad, Ava. I\u0027m trying to give myself one less person-two, actually, as Steven\u0027ll be coming home-to worry about. You\u0027d be doing me a favor if you and Steven take your vacation now.\"\\n\\n Ava tilted her head. \"I\u0027m not doing you any favors, Phoebe. I\u0027m not leaving Essie or Carly, and that\u0027s all there is to it. If it was just you, I\u0027d go, because a more self-sufficient woman I\u0027ve never known. To the point of being annoying at times. Such as now.\"\\n\\n Phoebe shifted in her chair. \"You shouldn\u0027t make me mad on day one either.\"\\n\\n \"Then I\u0027ll hope to avoid that and tell you I\u0027ve already talked to\\n\\n Steven and told him he should go on up to Bar Harbor with the family of his college roommate as they\u0027ve hit it off so well. He won\u0027t be coming home until June. And if we\u0027re not back to normal by then...\" Ava scooped a hand through her swing of hair. \"I\u0027ll think of another way to keep him from coming home.\"\\n\\n \"Which tells me you didn\u0027t tell him why you\u0027re so easy about him going to Maine.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s my baby same as Carly\u0027s yours, no matter how old he is. I\u0027m not letting him come into this. Essie needs me, and while Carly has some of your self-sufficiency, she\u0027s just a little girl, and she needs me, too. And so, damn it, Phoebe, do you. So you can just forget tossing me off like I was more weight than value.\"\\n\\n \"If I didn\u0027t value you, I wouldn\u0027t want you to go. You could take\\n\\n Carly and...\" Phoebe dropped her head in her hands. \"I know that won\u0027t work. I know it, but it doesn\u0027t stop me from wanting it. If I sent Carly away, she\u0027d be upset and scared, probably more than she is now. Mama\u0027d be frantic. I know it, Ava. Just as I know I can\u0027t leave Mama on her own day after day after day in the house. I need you here, but I love you, and I wish you could go.\"\\n\\n \"There, I\u0027m not mad at you anymore.\" She skirted the desk and chair to wrap her arms around Phoebe from behind, press cheek to cheek. \"We\u0027re all on edge.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s what he wants,\" Phoebe said quietly. \"Whoever he is, that\u0027s what he wants first.\"\\n\\n \"Then sitting down to a nice meal is like flipping him the bird, if you ask me. We got us a nice roasted chicken, and I taught Josie how to make scalloped potatoes.\"\\n\\n \"Which means I\u0027ll give him the finger a second time when I have to go up and work out to make up for eating two helpings of those damn potatoes.\"\\n\\n \"Better keep it to one and save room for strawberry shortcake.\"\\n\\n \"Oh God, why do you torture me?\"\\n\\n \"When I\u0027m upset, I cook.\" Ava eased back. \"I cooked a hell of a lot today.\"\\n\\n It had been beautiful. He couldn\u0027t believe how perfect and powerful it had been. Every minute, every breath, from the moment he\u0027d tossed that worthless fuck Roy into the trunk of his overpriced status car until the instant he\u0027d blown him to hell had been an e-ticket ride.\\n\\n Better, by far, than shooting the gangbanger. That had been so quick, and so much less dramatic.\\n\\n Still, he wished he could have seen Phoebe\u0027s face when Roy went boom. That would\u0027ve been the icing.\\n\\n He looked at it now, the face tacked to the wall of his workshop. A face among many faces. All hers. Phoebe MacNamara. Coming home from a hard day of screwing with other people\u0027s lives. Standing around talking to one of her idiot neighbors. Walking her spoiled brat to the park, or along River Street. Swapping spit with that rich bastard she was screwing now.\\n\\n Since he was still celebrating his recent success, he popped the top on another beer and toasted the many faces of Phoebe.\\n\\n \"Sweating now, aren\u0027t you, bitch? Oh yeah, you\u0027re sweating now. And you\u0027ll shed buckets before I\u0027m done.\"\\n\\n Trying to figure it out, he thought. She\u0027d be racking her brains on this one. Who would kill poor Roy? Who\u0027d do such a cruel thing? Boo hoo!\\n\\n Hearing her voice in his head, he laughed so hard he had to sit down.\\n\\n Too bad she hadn\u0027t started fucking the rich bastard a couple months sooner. With more time, more research, more legwork, he might\u0027ve been able to target the new playmate instead of the ex-husband. Still, might be able to work something out. Just needed to think, to plan, to consider. Maybe take an opportunity, or make one.\\n\\n \"See what we see when we see it there,\" he muttered. \"Got us a timetable, Phoebe.\" He lifted the beer again. \"Counting down now. Tick, tick, tick. The last tick, and it all goes up in blood and smoke.\" Like she had, he thought, as another face swam into his mind. And with that image burning behind his eyes, he wept.\\n\\n After dinner, after her daughter was safely tucked into bed, after the last call from her captain, Phoebe sat staring at the files.\\n\\n There was a hollow place in the center of her now, as if something vital had just been carelessly scooped out.\\n\\n She needed to work through it, or around it. If she could get her focus back, she could concentrate on the names, on the cases, on the reason. But that hollow place sat there, and threatened to pull the rest of her inside it.\\n\\n She picked up the phone and called Duncan\u0027s number without asking herself why she reached for him. Or why when he answered the rim around that hollow place began to shake.\\n\\n \" I... Duncan.\"\\n\\n \"Phoebe. I was just talking to myself about you. Whether I should call you, or leave you alone for a while. Are you home?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" The hand holding her cell phone wanted to shake, too. \"I\u0027m home. Are you?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Checking up on me?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t mean to...\" To what? \"To hover.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s back up. I\u0027d ask what\u0027s wrong, but answer\u0027s obvious. Is there something else?\"\\n\\n \"I just talked to Dave. Everyone here\u0027s as settled as they can be, considering. I didn\u0027t want to say anything, to tell them now when...\\n\\n Jesus. So, I call you and babble. Sorry. I should... something else.\"\\n\\n \"What did Dave tell you that you don\u0027t want to tell them?\"\\n\\n \"Quick trigger on the brain. I like that about you. I\u0027ll probably find it annoying eventually. If it comes to eventually. He called to tell meI needed to know-that they found... one minute.\" She lowered the phone, got her breathing back in order. \"There was a timer on the explosives. Roy. There was a timer set. The remote, that was backup, I guess. Or in case he wanted to go early. There was a timer, Duncan, set for one thirty-five. He was never going to let Roy live. No matter what I did or said, no matter what was done, it was always going to end the way it ended.\"\\n\\n There was a pause, and she could hear Duncan let out a long breath. \"He gave it enough time to make sure you\u0027d get there. Built in some time so he could play with you. He wanted you to see it. He wanted you on the spot. You know that, Phoebe.\"\\n\\n \"He wanted me to bargain and wheedle and beg. And he wanted me to know, after it was done, that none of it mattered. Nothing I do will matter, because everything\u0027s already set. Clock\u0027s ticking down.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s got the last part wrong, because what you do will matter.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s got me scared to death. Just where he wants me.\"\\n\\n \"You called the wrong guy if you expect me to tell you not to be scared. What are you going to do about it?\"\\n\\n \"What am I going to do about being scared?\"\\n\\n \"No, what are you going to do about finding him so you don\u0027t have to be scared anymore.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m reading files and looking for any... You\u0027re not going to tell me to be strong and brave?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve seen you in action, I know you\u0027re both. But there are limits. Why don\u0027t I come over? I can read files.\"\\n\\n She swiveled from her desk so she could look at the dark pressing on the windows. \"You\u0027re offering to come over so I don\u0027t have to feel strong and brave.\" The empty spot inside her began to close. \"That\u0027s done the job.\"\\n\\n \"Give me half an hour and-\"\\n\\n \"No, no, I don\u0027t need you to come. I guess I just needed you to say you would. I just needed to hear\u0027t h a\u0027t... that I had an option,\" she realized. \"Let me ask you one question, and remember, I\u0027m an active listener, so I\u0027ll know if you\u0027re lying. Considering the situation, are you sorry you asked me out for that drink?\"\\n\\n \"Considering any situation, I figure it was the best move I ever made.\" She could smile. \"Maybe second best, after deciding to buy a sixpack and a lottery ticket.\"\\n\\n \"Might be running neck and neck. Phoebe, why don\u0027t you pack it in for the night? Get some sleep.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, maybe I\u0027ll do that.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027m an active listener, but I know a lie when I hear one.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I\u0027ll do that in a couple hours. Thanks for saying what I needed to hear.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be around if you need to hear something else.\"\\n\\n \"Good night, Duncan.\"\\n\\n After a short, restless night, Phoebe considered working from home. Which would mean, she knew, little work at all, as she\u0027d decided to keep Carly out of school for at least a few days.\\n\\n Even if she could convince Carly to occupy herself elsewhere, Phoebe knew she\u0027d be distracted-and she\u0027d feel guilty being at home and barricading herself from her daughter. And her mother.\\n\\n Better to go in, stay busy, be productive. There were cops on the house, no need to worry. Unless he got past the cops, she thought as she tried to work a miracle with makeup. Which he wouldn\u0027t, but if he did, there was the security alarm.\\n\\n And someone who could rig a bomb with remote and timer could probably bypass an alarm.\\n\\n But he wouldn\u0027t, she told herself. He wouldn\u0027t.\\n\\n She gave up on any attempt to style her hair and simply yanked it back in a tail.\\n\\n All her efforts were going to focus on identifying Roy\u0027s killer, finding him and arresting him. Until then paperwork would wait, the scheduled training sessions would be postponed.\\n\\n Lack of sleep meant she had a solid list of names. She\u0027d start knocking on doors that morning, asking questions, gauging ground. It could be over by end of shift, she told herself as she gathered her files. And if it wasn\u0027t, she\u0027d keep right on until it was over.\\n\\n As she started out of her room, she calculated it was early enough for her to slip downstairs, make coffee, leave a note and be out before anyone stirred.\\n\\n She stopped by Carly\u0027s door, peeked in.\\n\\n Her daughter was sprawled across the bed, covers kicked off. The worn-eared bear Carry chose most often for a sleeping companion dozed at the tips of her fingers.\\n\\n Satisfied, Phoebe backed away. If she caved and crept in to cover Carly, give her a quick kiss, that would be that. The kid was a light morning sleeper. Blue eyes would pop right open, and the questions would begin.\\n\\n Instead, Phoebe continued downstairs. Coffee, she thought again, and maybe a quick carton of the low-fat yogurt she constantly tried to convince herself she actually liked. Leave a note on the fridge, check with the cop on duty, and she\u0027d be gone.\\n\\n As she stepped into the kitchen, Essie turned from the stove. Both women gasped and stumbled back.\\n\\n \"I thought you were upstairs asleep,\" Phoebe said.\\n\\n \"I thought you were.\" Essie gave her heart two quick pats. \"Though you might as well shoot me as scare me to death, I\u0027d as soon you didn\u0027t. Shoot me,\" she said with a nod toward the hand Phoebe had on the butt of her weapon.\\n\\n \"Sorry.\" Phoebe let her hand slide away. \"It\u0027s barely six in the morning, Mama. Why aren\u0027t you upstairs sleeping?\" And at her mother\u0027s quiet stare, Phoebe shook her head, then moved over. \"Mama.\" With her arms around Essie, she rocked. \"What a goddamn mess.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re dressed for work.\"\\n\\n Phoebe kept holding, kept rocking, but the eyes she\u0027d closed opened again. \"I need to go in.\"\\n\\n \"I wish you didn\u0027t. I wish you wouldn\u0027t. I wish... No, don\u0027t pull back to pat and placate me.\" Essie\u0027s voice sharpened as she tightened her hold on Phoebe. \"You\u0027re still my little girl, and I wish I could keep you safe in this house. My whole family\u0027s under this roof now, and I wishI know it\u0027s sick and it\u0027s selfish but, my God, I wish I could keep all of you here.\"\\n\\n It was Essie who stepped back. \"And I know I can\u0027t. I\u0027ll get your coffee.\"\\n\\n Phoebe started to say she\u0027d get it herself, then stopped. Busy hands, she knew, helped her mother\u0027s worried mind. \"I know you\u0027re scared, Mama.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Course I\u0027m scared. I\u0027d be stupid not to be. Roy\u0027s worthless ass is blown to hell.\" She glanced back as she got out a mug. \"I keep thinking\\n\\n I should feel bad saying that kind of thing, but I don\u0027t. You never blamed him nearly enough, to my way of thinking. Didn\u0027t matter, because I blamed him plenty for both of us. But I\u0027m scared for you, baby.\\n\\n For all of us.\"\\n\\n She poured coffee, added the cream and sugar exactly as Phoebe preferred. \"I know you\u0027re worried I\u0027ve gotten worse.\"\\n\\n \"I worry,\" Phoebe agreed. \"I\u0027m still your little girl, right? Well, you\u0027ll always be my mama.\"\\n\\n \"Sit down, baby. I\u0027m going to fix you some breakfast.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have time. I\u0027m just going to grab a carton of yogurt.\"\\n\\n \"You hate that stuff.\"\\n\\n \"I know. But I\u0027m trying to acquire a taste.\" Determined, Phoebe opened the fridge, grabbed a carton at random. Once she\u0027d opened it, : gotten a spoon, she leaned back against the counter. \"I know that with what happened, with being smart enough to be scared, you\u0027d be cautious about going out in the courtyard, or onto the front veranda, but-\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been having trouble with that for a while now.\" Idly, Essie picked up a dishcloth to wipe the already spotless counter. \"The veranda, the bedroom terrace especially. Palpitations,\" she said. \"Knowing it\u0027s in my head doesn\u0027t make my heart beat any easier. But what you\u0027ve never really understood is, I\u0027m content inside this house. I don\u0027t need what\u0027s out there.\"\\n\\n Phoebe ate some yogurt. It tasted sour, just like her thoughts. \"The world?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got a nice world inside this house most days, and if I need to know anything more about the outside one, I\u0027ve got my computer. Honey, let me fix you some eggs.\"\\n\\n \"This is fine.\" She picked up her coffee to wash the taste away. \"Have you been having panic attacks when I\u0027m not here?\"\\n\\n \"Not full-blown ones. Tickles now and then. Phoebe, there\u0027s only one reason I wish I could walk out that door. That\u0027s so you could, if that\u0027s what you wanted. So you could walk away from this house. If I could, is that what you\u0027d do?\"\\n\\n \"Mama, I don\u0027t have time to talk about this now.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not yet six-thirty in the morning, and if you\u0027re in a hurry, then you can answer quick and be done with it.\"\\n\\n Phoebe opened a cabinet, tossed the half-eaten yogurt in the trash.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Some days, I\u0027d say yes. I\u0027d walk away from this house just to spite Cousin Bess. She had no right, no right to work you like a dog and give you nothing.\"\\n\\n \"She gave me a place to take my children when I was desperate.\"\\n\\n \"And made you pay and pay and pay, every single day.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think that mattered?\" The little white scar stood out sharply when Essie\u0027s cheeks flushed with emotion. \"Do you think that ever mattered to me?\"\\n\\n \"It should have.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s you, Phoebe. You\u0027ve got a tough mind in there, and you tend to draw hard lines with it.\"\\n\\n \"Mama-\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you\u0027ve had to have one, and maybe you need those lines.\\n\\n And still, my darling girl, what wouldn\u0027t you do to be sure your Carly is safe and well? Did you leave Roy, when God knows you hate to give up on anything, hate to lose? Did you walk away from the FBI for yourself, or because you believed it was better for her if you took the position with the local police? For her, and for me-and don\u0027t think I haven\u0027t always known that. Did you count the cost?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not the same, Mama. She treated you like dirt, and Carter little better.\"\\n\\n \"And I\u0027ve always felt there was a special place in hell with her name on it for the times she pinched and poked at that poor little boy. But he had a home, and food, and he had you and me. He had Ava, God love her, for good measure.\"\\n\\n \"The house should\u0027ve been yours, free and clear.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s mine close enough, not free and clear, but mine all the same. Do you hate it so, Phoebe?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" She sighed. \"No. Some days I hate the idea of it, I hate the strings she pulls even from that reserved table in hell. She knew I would, and it burns my ass, Mama, to prove her right. But the fact is, Carly loves this house. She loves the courtyard and her room, she loves the neighborhood and the park. So, no, I don\u0027t count the cost. Or only when I\u0027m feeling pissy. So I don\u0027t know, Mama, if you could walk out the door, if I would, too.\"\\n\\n She drained her coffee. \"I have to get to work.\"\\n\\n \"I know you do.\"\\n\\n Essie stayed where she was, listening to Phoebe walk down the hall, across the foyer. She heard the door open, close. And she moved to the window, to look out at the courtyard with its lovely flowers and shrubs, its elegant fountain and pretty pockets of shade.\\n\\n And she saw a bottomless black pit. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/high-noon/page-24.html","bookId":2412,"book":{"id":2412,"title":"High Noon","description":"Storyline: Police Lieutenant Phoebe MacNamara found her calling at an early age when an unstable man broke into her family\u0027s home, trapping and terrorizing them for hours.
