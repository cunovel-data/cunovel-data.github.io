{"id":75263,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"She would not feel guilty because she was doing something outside the house and family on a Sunday evening. She would not feel guilty. It was a litany Phoebe repeated off and on through the day, starting when Carly bounced into her bed for Sunday Morning Snuggles. Snuggle they did so Phoebe snuck kisses and sniffs of her daughter\u0027s soft curly hair, deliciously shampooed the night before. Cuddled up, she got the lowdown on Sherrilynn\u0027s brother Tear-so named because he always seemed to be on one-sawing off the heads of two of Sherrilynn\u0027s Barbies with his daddy\u0027s penknife before he was caught and suitably punished. Heads on the same pillow, nose to nose, they expressed their mutual horror over the crime. What had she ever done to earn such a perfect, precious child? Phoebe wondered. How could she not spend every free moment of every day with this incredible little girl? Of course, later that morning when she and Carly bumped heads over Carly\u0027s desperate need for the purple butterfly sandals she\u0027d seen in one of her grandmother\u0027s catalogues, Phoebe wondered how she could dare risk letting this pint-sized shoe hog out of her sight for ten minutes. She would not feel guilty. And wasn\u0027t Carly going off to a backyard picnic birthday party at her current best friend in the entire world Poppy\u0027s house? And wasn\u0027t Ava already set to drop her off, then pick her up, bookending her own trip to a flower show? And Mama? Well, Mama was so busy designing new patterns, organizing her threads and yarns, she\u0027d barely notice if Phoebe jetted off for a weekend trip to Antigua. There was nothing to feel guilty about. But she suffered twinges of it nonetheless as she brushed Carly\u0027s lovely bright hair, helped pick out the absolutely perfect hair clips. She fought against those twinges while she approved Carly\u0027s choice-after numerous rejections-ofjust the right outfit. They tugged again while she stood on the front veranda, waving to Ava and her fashionable little girl as they drove off for their Sunday outings. Inside, she hunted up her mother, only to find Essie on her sittingroom computer, laughing away as she clattered on the keyboard. Chat room, Phoebe thought. The agoraphobic\u0027s constant friend. Still, Phoebe leaned against the doorjamb, watching as her mother\u0027s fingers flew and her eyes sparkled with humor. This was one of her safe conduits to the outside world, after all. Neighbors still dropped by, or old friends paid calls. Now and then Essie would have a group of women over for tea, and God knew she always enjoyed it if she or Ava planned a cocktail or dinner party. People came. Of course they came. The South loved their eccentrics, and to many in Savannah who knew the MacNamaras, Essie\u0027s condition was no more than a charming little eccentricity. Essie MacNamara? they might say. She was Essie Carter before she married Benedict MacNamara. Married up, too, and only to be widowed before she was thirty. Just a tragedy! She hasn\u0027t stepped one foot outside ofMacNamara House on Jones in ten years or more, bless her heart. She comes out on the veranda sometimes, and she\u0027s still as pretty as a picture. And so slim. Of course, they\u0027d never weathered one of Mama\u0027s panic attacks, or watched her struggle just to find the courage to step out on that veranda. They hadn\u0027t seen her weep with gratitude when her future daughter-inlaw asked if she and Carter could have the wedding at the house. God bless Josie, Phoebe thought. And hell, God bless the Internet while she was at it. If her mother couldn\u0027t go out into the world, at least the world could come to her through her computer. \"Hey, sweetie pie.\" Essie\u0027s fingers stilled as she spotted Phoebe. \"You need something?\" \"No. No, I was just poking in to let you know I\u0027m going up to work out, then I\u0027m going to get ready to go out.\" Essie\u0027s dimples deepened with her smile. \"With Duncan.\" \"To a barbecue at one of his friend\u0027s.\" \"You have a good time, and don\u0027t forget the flowers you put in the spare fridge now.\" \"I won\u0027t.\" \"And wear the green sundress,\" Essie called out as Phoebe turned. \"Show off those nice shoulders. God knows you work hard enough on them.\" Phoebe glanced back. \"Should I wear more blush, too, so I can catch me a husband?\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"Nothing. I\u0027ll check back with you before I go.\" She escaped to her little gym, and a solid sweaty hour. Later in the shower, she wondered if she\u0027d been using exercise over the past months as a substitute for sex. She\u0027d definitely kicked it up a few notches in the past six months. Eight months, she corrected, rinsing shampoo out of her hair. Or was it ten? \"Well,Jesus, had it actually been a year since she\u0027d had sex? Shoving at her dripping hair, she began to obsessively backtrack and count. Ava\u0027s son\u0027s friend\u0027s neighbor Wilson-Ava had arranged the date, pushed for it until Phoebe caved. He\u0027d turned out to be very nice, Phoebe remembered. Kind of sweet with his shy smile and little goatee. He liked country music and football, and had been on the tail end of a divorce. They\u0027d enjoyed each other\u0027s company enough to date a few times, and she\u0027d slept with him twice. It had been, she recalled, nice. The same way he\u0027d been nice. And then he\u0027d reconciled with his wife. That was nice, too, really. She\u0027d heard they\u0027d had a baby since... Wait a minute, wait one damn minute. She snapped off the shower, grabbed a towel. Wrapping it around her, she put the congenial, wishyouall-the-best breakup with the very nice Wilson into the context of time, of season, of date. Shortly after New Year\u0027s, she remembered. She\u0027d slept with him on New Year\u0027s Eve, then again a few nights later. New Year\u0027s of last year, she realized with a jolt. \"My God! I haven\u0027t had sex in fifteen months.\" She stepped over to the mirror, wiped the fog away so she could stare at her own face. \"I\u0027m thirty-three years old and I haven\u0027t had sex in fifteen months. What\u0027s wrong with me?\" She pressed a hand on her belly. What if everything was rusted in there? It didn\u0027t matter if she knew better, intellectually, it was still a horrible and scary thought. And what if she had sex with Duncan, and it was so good she started skipping the workouts (which surely were a substitute for sex)? She\u0027d get out of shape, become flabby and lazy. Then he probably wouldn\u0027t be attracted to her anymore. Hadn\u0027t he commented on her body? Hadn\u0027t he? So when her body went soft and flabby, he wouldn\u0027t want to have sex with her, which would send her back to Pilates with a vengeance. It would cycle over and over, until she died with rusted plumbing and six-pack abs. Jesus, she needed therapy. Amused at herself, she wrapped her hair in a towel before she deliberately reached for her best, special-occasion-only body cream. Cycle or not, it was time to break the fifteen-month deadlock. Not just with anyone, she reminded herself. She wasn\u0027t a slut-all too obviously. She avoided giving or receiving any signals from other cops, from criminalists, from prosecutors. Date or sleep with someone associated with the job, everyone on the job knew about it. That severely limited the field of play for her. And it was true she\u0027d been the one to make the first move toward bed with nice Wilson. But she\u0027d liked him, enjoyed going out with him. Besides, before that New Year\u0027s Eve she hadn\u0027t been with a man for... No, no, no. She wasn\u0027t going to count back again and make herself crazy. She was picky, that\u0027s all-and good for her, right? She was picky about whom she dated, and a whole lot pickier about whom she slept with. She had pride, she had her values, and most important, she had a daughter to consider. Yet here she was obsessing about sex while getting ready for a simple Sunday barbecue. Pitiful. She took another long, searching look at herself in the mirror. Pitiful or not, she was going to use a little extra blush. And wear the damn green dress. She took longer than usual to put herself together. Not as long as it took Carly, the Fashion Princess, to primp for a backyard picnic, but longer than her usual routine. Her first reward for the effort was the beaming smile her mother sent her when Phoebe stopped by Essie\u0027s sitting room. Essie had switched from chat room to sketching, but stopped when Phoebe did a flourishing turn in the doorway. \"Well?\" \"Oh, Phoebe, you look a picture!\" \"Not too much?\" \"Honey, it\u0027s a simple dress, and just perfect for a Sunday barbecue. It\u0027s how it looks on you that snaps. You look all fresh and sexy at the same time.\" \"Exactly the combination I was shooting for. Duncan\u0027s going to be here in a few minutes, I expect. I\u0027m going down to get those flowers. Anything you need before I leave?\" \"Not a thing. You have a good time, now.\" \"I will. I\u0027ll be back before Carly\u0027s bedtime, but-\" \"If you\u0027re not, I think Ava and I know how to tuck her up. I don\u0027t want you watching the clock.\" She wouldn\u0027t, Phoebe promised herself. She\u0027d just let it all unfold at its own time and pace. She\u0027d enjoy herself, and enjoy knowing she looked fresh and sexy in a green sundress that showed off her arms and back. She\u0027d worked hard enough on them. She went down, and out to the summer kitchen. In Cousin Bess\u0027s day it had been used routinely. For the lavish parties she enjoyed throwing, for canning, for preparation of simple meals on hot nights. They used it more sporadically now, but the second refrigerator was handy for storing extra cold drinks. Phoebe took out the butter-yellow daisies she\u0027d picked up as a hostess gift. It was going to be a pretty evening, she decided, and turned to admire the flowers of the courtyard Ava had labored over. \"Well, my God!\" She stared, openmouthed, at the dead rat at the bottom of the steps. She had to bury revulsion to step down for a closer look. No doubt it was dead, but it didn\u0027t look mauled, as she\u0027d expected. As she imagined it would if some cat had caught it, then gotten bored enough to dump it in the courtyard like some nasty neighbor\u0027s gift. If she\u0027d had to guess at cause of death, she\u0027d have voted for the sharp spring of a trap, right across the neck. The idea made her shudder as she stepped back again. Some kids, she thought, playing a particularly unpleasant prank, tossing a dead rat over the wall. She went back inside, dug up a shoe box, got the broom. And, stomach rolling with disgust, managed to sweep and nudge the corpse inside. She wasn\u0027t ashamed to look away with her eyes half-closed as she put on the lid, or to hold the box at arm\u0027s length to carry it to the trash can. Shuddering, shuddering, she backpedaled from the trash can, then turned to dash inside. She scrubbed her hands like a surgeon before an operation, all the while telling herself not to be an idiot. She hadn\u0027t touched the awful thing. She had herself nearly settled down when the doorbell rang. The quick, appreciative grin on Duncan\u0027s face did the rest of the job. \"Hello, gorgeous.\" \"Hello back.\" \"Those for me?\" She tucked the flowers in the crook of her arm as she closed the door behind her. \"They certainly are not. They\u0027re for our hostess. Or host. You never said which it was.\" \"Hostess. How\u0027s that shoulder?\" \"It\u0027s coming right along, thank you.\" She sent him a knowing look. \"I\u0027m about ready to start arm wrestling again.\" \"I knew this guy when I was tending bar. Russian guy, arms looked like toothpicks. Nobody could take him down. I don\u0027t think he ever paid for a drink.\" He opened the car door for her. \"You smell great, by the way.\" \"I really do.\" She laughed, slid in. When he got in, she shifted toward him. \"Now tell me about this friend of yours who\u0027s going to be feeding me.\" \"Best person I know. She\u0027s great. You\u0027ll like her. Actually, she\u0027s the mother of my best friend, who also happens to be my lawyer.\" \"You\u0027re best friends with your lawyer? That\u0027s refreshing.\" \"I met Phin when I was driving a cab. Nobody hails a cab in Savannah, which you\u0027d know since you live here. It was just one of those things. I was heading back to the line at the Hilton, just dropped off a fare. Raining cats that day. He spotted me, I spotted him. He waved me down. Heading to the courthouse, big hurry. Later, I found out he was this struggling young associate, and they\u0027d called him to bring some papers down. Anyway, I get him there, and he pulls out his wallet. Which is empty.\" \"Uh-oh.\" \"He\u0027s mortified. Sometimes fares try to scam you that way, pull some sob story, whatever. But I\u0027ve got a good gauge and this guy is seriously embarrassed. He\u0027s apologizing all over himself, scribbling down my name and the cab number from the license, swearing on his mother\u0027s life he\u0027s going to come down to the cab company with the fare and a big tip. Yeah, yeah, yeah.\" \"A likely story,\" Phoebe commented, enjoying herself. \"I spring him, figure I\u0027ll never see him again. No way is this guy going to haul down to the cab company over an eight-dollar fare.\" \"But?\" \"Yeah, but. I\u0027m clocking out that night, and he comes in. Gives me twenty. First, I\u0027m floored he\u0027d bother to come in, and second, twenty for an eight-dollar run\u0027s over the top. And I tell him, dude, ten\u0027s enough, thanks. But he won\u0027t back off the twenty. So I say fine, let\u0027s go have a couple of beers on the other ten. And we did.\" \"And you\u0027ve been friends ever since.\" \"Yeah.\" \"I\u0027d say that story shows a bit of what you\u0027re both made of.\" She glanced around as he began to drive through the pretty, residential streets of Midtown. \"I grew up down this way-well, started growing up down this way. We had a nice little house on the other side of Columbus Drive.\" \"Good memories or bad?\" \"Oh, both. But I\u0027ve always liked the area, the mix of styles in the houses, kids everywhere.\" He pulled into the already crowded drive of a lovely craftsman-style home, with its big front yard tidily mowed and edged with flower beds. \"Me, too,\" he said. He came around the car to take her hand. She heard the shouts and shrieks of children, the motorized thunder of a lawn mower. She smelled peonies, and meat cooking on someone\u0027s backyard grill. She\u0027d grown up like this, she thought, for the first little while. Then everything, everything had changed. The screen door opened with a happy slam. The woman who stepped out onto the big front porch was hugely pregnant, with skin the color of semisweet chocolate and hair in a glossy profusion of dreads. A boy dashed out behind her, scabs riding both knees. \"Dune, Dune, Dune!\" He shouted it as he streaked like a little bullet down the walk. \"Catch!\" And flew. Obviously an old hand at the game, Duncan caught the boy in midair, then flipped him upside down. \"The strange creature you see below is Ellis.\" \"How do you do, Ellis?\" \"Hi! Do it again, Dune.\" \"Ellis Tyler, you let Duncan get in the house before you start jumping all over him.\" The boy might\u0027ve been upside down, but he managed a dramatic eye-roll. \"Yes\u0027m.\" When Duncan flipped him to his feet, he grinned. \"We got cherry pie. Come on in, Dune. Come on! You can come, too, ma\u0027am.\" With that he made his dash back into the house. \"My son likes to be the welcoming committee. You must be Phoebe. I\u0027m Celia. I hope you came hungry.\" She tipped her face up for Duncan\u0027s kiss. \"I know you did.\" \"How many cherry pies?\" Duncan asked. \"Just you wait. Duncan\u0027s here!\" she shouted as she scooted them inside. There was an army of them, Phoebe realized, in all shapes and sizes. Babies, toddlers, gangly teens, and an ancient old man they called Uncle Walter, men, women, and all the noise that went with them. Most were congregated in the backyard, sprawled in chairs, on the grass, chasing kids, pushing them on the bright red swing set. A couple of men stood by the grill, watching it smoke with all the pleasure and delight they might have shown were it a centerfold. By Phoebe\u0027s estimate five generations were represented here, but the center of power, the magnetic north, was obviously the woman who stood supervising as younger family members hauled two picnic tables together to form one long space. She was comfortably round in the way that made Phoebe imagine every child would want to crawl into her lap, would want to rest their head on her breast for comfort. Her handsome face with its deep-set eyes, strong nose and mouth, was capped off by a puffball of ebony curls. Both hands fisted on her generous hips, and when a big yellow dog streaked by after the blur of a gray-striped cat, she threw back her head and laughed so her whole body shook with it. Then she turned toward the ancient old man, her hands moving. It took Phoebe a moment to realize she wasn\u0027t merely gesturing but signing. The old man wheezed out a laugh, signed back. Duncan\u0027s arm draped around Phoebe\u0027s shoulder, and when she glanced up to smile at him, she saw he was looking over at the laughing woman. On his face, deep in those soft blue eyes of his, was absolute and unconditional love. It struck her suddenly, and with a little curl of terror, that this was a moment. Not just a backyard barbecue. She had to fight the urge to streak away like the cat when Duncan led her forward. \"Ma Bee.\" Bee took hold of him first, her big arms going around him, pulling him into a hard, full hug. When she pulled him back, she patted his face with both hands. \"You\u0027re still skinny, and you\u0027re still white.\" \"You\u0027re still the love of my life.\" She gave that full-body laugh, but her eyes were tender on his face. Then they shifted, turning speculative, to Phoebe. \"Ma Bee, this is Phoebe MacNamara. Phoebe, Beatrice Hector.\" \"It\u0027s wonderful to meet you, Mrs. Hector. Thank you for having me today.\" \"Somebody\u0027s ma raised her right.\" She winked at Duncan. \"You\u0027re welcome here,\" she told Phoebe. \"You brought me daisies? I\u0027ve got a fondness for daisies, thank you.\" She took them, cradled them. \"They\u0027ve got such happy faces. Tisha? You take these daisies in for me, and get that blue glass vase Arnette gave me last Mother\u0027s Day. It\u0027s in the rightside cupboard under the big server. That blue vase is just what these daisies want.\" Bee made introductions as one of the teenage girls came over for the flowers. Phoebe got a polite if measuring look-Duncan a wistful one. \"Uncle Walter here\u0027s been deaf since he got hurt in the Korean War,\" Bee explained, and signed Phoebe\u0027s name for him. And snickered when he signed back. \"Says you\u0027re prettier than the last one this skinny white boy brought by.\" With a smile, Phoebe gave the sign for thanks. \"It\u0027s one of the few I know,\" she said as Bee pursed her lips. \"Hello, goodbye, thanks.\" \"You decide you need to converse with him, he can read lips if you talk straight to him, and slow. Mostly, he\u0027s going to sleep anyway. And this here\u0027s my daughter-in-law, my second boy Phin\u0027s wife. Loo-\" \"I know you,\" Phoebe and Loo said together. \"Lieutenant MacNamara.\" \"Louise Hector, for the defense. Small world.\" \"Seems like, and previously we\u0027ve been on opposite sides of it. Welcome to Ma\u0027s.\" \"Since you\u0027re acquainted, you get Phoebe what she drinks, and in troduce her round the rest of the way.\" Bee lifted her chin toward the picnic tables. \"We\u0027ve got to get food out on the tables here.\" Excellent, Phoebe thought, busywork. Just the thing to ease herself into the social. \"Is there something I can do to help?\" \"Guests don\u0027t haul out the dishes. That\u0027s for family. Duncan, we need some more chairs.\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am. Get you ladies a drink first?\" \"We\u0027ll take care of it,\" Loo told him, and led Phoebe away. \"What do you drink?\" All right, alcohol, another way to ease into the social. \"What\u0027s handy?\" Phoebe ended up with a plastic cup of chilled chardonnay, and so many names in her head she tried to alphabetize them to keep them straight. \"I didn\u0027t put the Phoebe Duncan talked about together with the lieutenant from the Hostage and Crisis Unit.\" Loo glanced over as they crossed the lawn edged with cheery flower beds and chunky shrubs. \"I\u0027m sorry to hear you were hurt a couple weeks ago.\" \"I\u0027m doing fine now.\" \"Well, you look fine. Love the dress. Let me introduce you to the grill masters. Phoebe MacNamara, my brother-in-law Zachary, and my husband, Phineas. Phoebe\u0027s a cop, so watch yourselves.\" \"Off duty.\" Phoebe lifted the wine cup as she shifted to avoid the smoke billowing from the grill. \"Can you fix speeding tickets?\" Zachary asked, and had Phin punching him in the arm. \"Pay him no mind.\" \"I\u0027m not kidding. Tisha\u0027s had two since the first of the year.\" Zachary sent Phoebe a wide grin. \"After you eat my chicken, we\u0027ll talk about it. You\u0027ll be softened up.\" \"Your chicken?\" \"Boy, you couldn\u0027t boil the egg this chicken started out as. That right, Loo?\" \"I take the Fifth.\" \"Couple a city lawyers,\" Zachary said to Phoebe, wagging his thumb between them. \"The lawyer with the empty wallet,\" Phoebe said. \"You will never live that down.\" Loo belted out a laugh, did a shoulder and hip wiggle as she wagged a finger at her husband. \"Deadbeat.\" \"I thought the story illustrated his innate sense of honor,\" Phoebe put in, and had Phin flashing his teeth. \"I like her. Leave her here. You\"-he pointed at his wife-\"can go.\" \"Mom!\" A girl sprinted over. Curly tails sprung out over both ears. \"Hero won\u0027t come down out of the tree! Make him come down.\" \"He\u0027ll come down when he\u0027s ready. Say how do you do to Miz MacNamara, Livvy.\" \"How do you do.\" \"Just fine, and how about you?\" \"The cat won\u0027t come down.\" \"They like being up high,\" Phoebe told her. \"Why?\" \"So they can feel superior to the rest of us.\" \"But Willy said he was going to fall and break his neck.\" \"Oh now, Livvy, you know he just said that to get a rise out of you.\" Loo gave her daughter\u0027s pigtail a tug. \"You wait till this chicken\u0027s on the table. That cat\u0027ll come down quick enough. You go on and wash up, \u0027cause it\u0027s almost time to eat.\" \"Are you sure he likes it up there?\" the child asked Phoebe. \"Absolutely.\" She watched Livvy run off. \"How old is she?\" \"She\u0027ll be seven next June.\" \"I have a little girl, just seven.\" \"Boy!\" Ma Bee\u0027s voice boomed over the yard. \"You going to finish up that chicken anytime today?\" \"It\u0027s coming, Ma,\" the men called back together, and began to heap it onto a platter. There was potato salad and black-eyed peas, collards and red beans, corn bread and cole slaw. She lost track of the platters and bowls, and how many were passed to her. Arguments-mostly good-natured-and jokes jumped and jostled around the table as frequently as the food. Many went over her head-family history, which appeared in several cases to include Duncan. Kids whined or complained, mostly about one another. Babies were passed like the bowls and platters, from hand to hand. Nothing like her family, Phoebe thought, the tidy number of them, the overwhelming female tone of even the most casual meal in MacNamara House. Poor Carter, she thought, forever unnumbered. There\u0027d never been an old man at one of their courtyard picnics to be fussed over until he dozed in his chair, or a couple of sparking-eyed little boys dueling with ears of corn. A bit out of her depth, Phoebe chatted with Celia about her children-she already had two-and the one yet to come. She shared a smile with Livvy as the high-climbing feline inched his way down the tree to come beg at the table. At one point Duncan and Phin debated heatedly about basketball, the sort that involved the jabbing of forks for emphasis and the slinging around of uncomplimentary names. As they insulted each other\u0027s brains, manhood, everyone else ignored them. Not just friends, Phoebe realized as the insults reached the point of absurd. Brothers. Whatever their backgrounds, upbringings, skin color, they were brothers. Nobody ragged on each other that way unless they were siblings-of the blood, or of the heart. She was having a Sunday barbecue with Duncan\u0027s family. Not just a moment, Phoebe realized. A monumental moment. \"Are you kin to Miss Elizabeth MacNamara, lived on Jones Street?\" Phoebe jolted out of her thoughts to meet Bee\u0027s steady eyes. \"Yes. She was my father\u0027s cousin. Did you know her?\" \"I knew who she was.\" Because the tone translated Bee\u0027s unfavorable opinion of Bess MacNamara, Phoebe\u0027s shoulders tensed. There were any number of people in Savannah who enjoyed painting all family members with the same sticky brush. \"I used to clean for Miz Tidebar on Jones,\" Bee continued, \"until she passed, about, oh, a dozen years ago now.\" \"I didn\u0027t know Mrs. Tidebar, except by name.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t think. She and Miz MacNamara Did Not Speak.\" The phrase came out in capital letters. \"Yes, I recall a feud. Something about a garden club committee.\" Which was an old rift before she\u0027d come to MacNamara House. As age had only ripened it, no one who lived under Cousin Bess\u0027s roof was permitted to speak or associate with the Tidebars. \"Miz Tiffany? She had her own people to clean, but I did for her now and then when she had a party or just needed another hand. She still living?\" \"She is.\" And Phoebe relaxed again. The odd and delightful Mrs. Tiffany was much safer ground. \"And as colorfully as ever.\" \"Was on her fourth husband when I did for her.\" \"She\u0027s had one more since, and I believe is currently on the prowl for number six.\" \"She always kept her name, didn\u0027t she? Tiffany, no matter how many she hooked down the aisle.\" \"Her second husband\u0027s name,\" Phoebe explained. \"She stuck with that, however many came after, as she likes the sparkle of it. Or so she says.\" Bee\u0027s lips twitched. \"Your cousin, as I recall, didn\u0027t have much truck with Miz Tiffany.\" \"Cousin Bess didn\u0027t have much truck with anyone. She was a... difficult woman.\" \"We are what we are. I\u0027d see your mama now and again, enough to say how do you do, when I did for Miz Tidebar. You favor her.\" \"Some. My daughter more. Carly\u0027s the image of her grandmother.\" \"She must be a pretty girl. You tell your mama Bee Hector sends her best.\" \"I will. I think she\u0027ll enjoy the connection. She\u0027s very fond of Duncan.\" \"We\u0027re fond of him around here, too.\" Bee leaned in a little while the men continued to argue. \"What\u0027re you going to do with that boy?\" \"Duncan?\" Maybe it was the wine, the steady beam from Bee\u0027s eyes, but Phoebe said what first came to mind. \"I\u0027m still deciding what I\u0027m going to let him do with me.\" Bee\u0027s laugh was an explosion of mirth. Her thick finger tapped Phoebe\u0027s shoulder. \"He\u0027s brought other pretty girls around here.\" \"I expect he has.\" \"But he hasn\u0027t brought any of them around for my approval before today.\" \"Oh.\" Phoebe decided she could use another sip of wine. \"Did I pass the audition?\" Bee smiled easily, then she thumped her hands on the table. \"Y\u0027all want pie and ice cream, we have to clear this table.\" Under the general scramble, Bee looked back at Phoebe. \"Why don\u0027t you grab some of these dishes, haul them into the kitchen.\" And that, Phoebe decided, made her by way of family. She ended the evening necking with Duncan at her own front door. \"I can\u0027t ask you in.\" More brain cells fried when he changed the angle of the kiss, spun it out. \"Which, mmm, is a euphemism for not being able to go up to my room and get each other naked.\" \"When?\" His hands glided up her, torturing them both. \"Where?\" \" I... I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m not being difficult or coy. I hate that word. Carly. My mother.\" She waved a hand toward the house. \"It\u0027s all so complicated.\" \"Have dinner with me. My place.\" Her bones turned to mush as his lips trailed down her neck. Dinner at his place, now that was definitely code for sex. Thank God. \"You\u0027re going to cook?\" \"No, I want you to live. I\u0027m going to order pizza.\" \"I like pizza fine.\" \"When?\" \" I... I can\u0027t tomorrow. I have to-\" She should think it through, of course. Be practical, be cautious. \"Tuesday. Tuesday night. I\u0027ll drive over after shift. As long as-\" \"There isn\u0027t somebody on a ledge, or holding hostages. I get it. Tuesday.\" He leaned back. \"What do you like on your pizza?\" \"Surprise me.\" \"Planning to. Night, Phoebe.\" \"Okay. Wait.\" She threw her arms around his neck again, dove headlong into the kiss until the need inside her edged toward actual pain. \"Okay.\" She went straight inside before she did something insane like pull his clothes off, then almost dreamily wound her way upstairs. The man could kiss her into a steamy puddle of lust. And, she had to admit, though she was eager for Tuesday night, this anticipation, this notquiteyet bumped up the pulse and warmed the belly. If she\u0027d felt this damn near giddy before over a man, she couldn\u0027t remember it-or him. That was saying something. She heard the TV in the family room, and Carly\u0027s laughter. Not quite bedtime, she thought. And she wanted a moment, just a moment or two by herself before she took what must have been a dopey smile into the family room. Because it was a pretty night, she opened her window. Soon enough, she thought, every window and door would be shut tight to hold in the air-conditioning and block out the steamy heat of Savannah in summer. She decided to change out of the sundress into her sleep clothes before joining her girls. She was stripped down to her underwear when she heard the whistling. It drifted through the open window, brought a quick chill to her skin. That tune. That same tune. The man with the camera. It came to her, the memory, the image of the man standing alone on River Street. But it couldn\u0027t be the same man, could it? Compelled, she grabbed her robe, pulled it on. By the time she got to the terrace doors, wrenched them open to go out to look, the whistling had stopped. No one strolled down the wide white sidewalk of Jones Street.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/high-noon/page-13.html","bookId":2412,"book":{"id":2412,"title":"High Noon","description":"Storyline: Police Lieutenant Phoebe MacNamara found her calling at an early age when an unstable man broke into her family\u0027s home, trapping and terrorizing them for hours.
