{"id":75270,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Phoebe leaned over after Duncan stopped the car. \"Thank you for going with me.\" She kissed him lightly. \"Thank you for the sex. And thank you for the ride home.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re welcome. And on the second part? Pretty much anytime.\"\\n\\n \"An additional thank-you.\" She brushed his lips one more time.\\n\\n \"For understanding I have to get myself home earlier than Cinderella most of the time.\"\\n\\n He trailed a finger around her ear. \"If I buy you some glass slippers, do you think we could arrange a sleepover?\"\\n\\n With a laugh, she got out of the car. \"You know, I was talking myself into backing off this-whatever this is-with you.\"\\n\\n \"Oh?\" He got out so they stood for a moment, studying each other on opposite sides of the car. \"Why is that?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying to remember. I had my reasons. Duncan, I\u0027m resistant to being swept away.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll leave the broom in the closet.\"\\n\\n Too late, she thought. Much too late. \"You\u0027re better at this than I am.\"\\n\\n \"At what?\"\\n\\n \"At whatever this is.\"\\n\\n Lights sparkled over in Forsythe Park, and there were soft pools of shadows along the street. Ava\u0027s flowers perfumed the air that threatened to turn sultry. Through the open windows of a passing car Delta Blues throbbed like a broken heart.\\n\\n Here she stood, Phoebe thought, looking over at a man who excited her so she noticed those small details she often overlooked. So that those details were like colorful backdrops in Act Three of her personal play. And she was fretting over it because she wasn\u0027t absolutely certain how the play would end.\\n\\n \"Did you ever get your heart broken? No, don\u0027t answer that now.\" she said quickly. \"That may be one of those long stories, and I have to get inside.\"\\n\\n \"Go out with me tomorrow night, and I\u0027ll tell you all about the many shattered pieces of my abused heart.\"\\n\\n \"How much of it will you be making up?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll have to go out with me to find out.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re just a little too appealing for my own good.\" She let out a sigh, glanced back at the house. \"I can\u0027t tomorrow-shouldn\u0027t. I don\u0027t like to spend too many evenings away.\"\\n\\n \"Pick a night.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you know about playing hard to get?\" He walked around to her. \"I\u0027m not playing.\"\\n\\n Her heart took a hard bump. \"No, you\u0027re not. I... well.\" Flustered, she glanced back at the house again. \"This week is a little difficult. Carly\u0027s school play is Thursday night, and there\u0027s a school holiday on Friday, so-\"\\n\\n \"Can I go?\" He eased a little closer and touched her. Just fingertips sliding down her arms until she wanted to shiver and sigh. \"To the play.\"\\n\\n She managed a laugh. \"Oh, trust me, you don\u0027t want to sacrifice yourself on the altar of an elementary school play.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds like fun.\" Sensing nerves, he smiled. Wasn\u0027t she the most interesting, contradictory woman? \"Cinderella, right? Wicked stepsister.\"\\n\\n \"How do you know that?\"\\n\\n \"Essie told me. Thursday night. What time?\"\\n\\n \"Seven, but-\"\\n\\n \"Seven\u0027s curtain? Should I meet you there, or come by and pick y\u0027all up? Plenty of room for you and Carly, Ava and... Essie can\u0027t go,\" he realized, and his easy humor faded. \"That must be hard, must be hard for her.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, it is. Very hard. We\u0027re getting it videotaped, but it\u0027s not the same. Duncan, if you really want to go-and that\u0027s very sweet-you should just meet us. I have to get Carly there an hour ahead, for costumes and such. I\u0027ll get you a ticket, leave it out front for you. But you don\u0027t have to feel obligated.\"\\n\\n Don\u0027t feel obligated, he thought, intrigued when she backed up a step. He decided on the spot that wild horses wouldn\u0027t keep him from a Thursday night date with Cinderella. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever been to a kiddie school play.\"\\n\\n \"You must\u0027ve been in one.\"\\n\\n \"I was once a belching frog. And I have a vague recollection of being a turnip once, or maybe it was a radish. But it was so traumatic, I\u0027ve blocked it out. Y\u0027all got any plans for the weekend?\"\\n\\n \"Ah, we\u0027re working out a Saturday playdate with Carly\u0027s current best friend. Details are not finalized.\"\\n\\n \"Great. Maybe they can do me a favor. Family fun center. Playworld? Heard of it?\"\\n\\n \"Been there, yes.\"\\n\\n \"Did Carly like it? Hate it? See I\u0027m thinking about investing, but I haven\u0027t decided whether to go into an established place like that or maybe do something new. Fresh. We could go on Saturday. Kid-test it.\" She stared at him as if he\u0027d sprouted a second head. \"You want to spend your Saturday in an amusement center with a couple of little girls?\"\\n\\n \"You make that sound just a little perverted. Actually, more than a couple of little girls would be better. I\u0027ve been tugging on Phin to bring Livvy into it, and maybe some of the others. You up for that?\"\\n\\n \"I imagine Carly would be delighted. Why an amusement center?\" she asked as she turned toward the house.\\n\\n \"Ah, well, fun would be the primary factor. If you\u0027re going toHold it.\" He grabbed her arm, pulled her back.\\n\\n Over the top step in the wash of the house light, the carcass of a dead rabbit drooped. The ruff around its neck was matted with dried blood that shone black against the brown fur.\\n\\n \"Oh, God, not again. I need to- Don\u0027t just touch it,\" Phoebe snapped out, \"with your hands.\"\\n\\n \"I use my hands instead of my feet for touching. Just a quirk.\" He lifted it by its hind legs. \"What do you mean, not again?\" Because her stomach pitched, Phoebe gave herself permission to look away. \"Let me get something. A bag, a box. Jesus. Take it around to the courtyard, would you? I\u0027ll be right there.\"\\n\\n She dashed into the house while Duncan frowned at the rabbit.\\n\\n Wasn\u0027t mauled, he mused as he studied it. It sure as hell didn\u0027t strike him as roadkill. He\u0027d given up hunting after his first and only foray into that area on a trip with a couple of friends as a teenager.\\n\\n He\u0027d liked the gun-the feel, the sound, even the jolt-but he hadn\u0027t much cared for what it could do when the target was flesh and blood.\\n\\n If he had to guess, the rabbit had been shot, small caliber. But why anyone would shoot a rabbit and toss it on Phoebe\u0027s steps was a mystery. He carried it through the courtyard gate just as she rushed out with a plastic grocery bag. \"We need to put it in here.\"\\n\\n \"You want to tell me why Bugs ended up dead on your steps?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, but I\u0027m going to have to build a damn graveyard if this keeps up. This is joining the rat I found out here a couple weeks ago, and the snake on the steps a few days ago.\"\\n\\n \"You had any altercations with any of the neighborhood boys?\"\\n\\n \"No. I ran that one down already. I don\u0027t think the local hellions are responsible. Put that thing down, will you?\"\\n\\n As he heard distress as well as disgust, Duncan eased the corpse into the bag. \"I think you\u0027re going to want to take this one in-to forensics or whatever. I\u0027m pretty sure it\u0027s got a bullet in it.\"\\n\\n She let out a long breath. \"I\u0027ll deal with it in the morning. Come inside, wash your hands.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d go inside, Duncan thought, but washing a little dead rabbit off his fingers wasn\u0027t primary.\\n\\n He followed her in, stepped to the kitchen sink. \"Got any beer?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"No. Yes. I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n After drying his hands, he simply walked to the refrigerator, opened it. Mostly girl food, as he thought of it. Lots of fruit, fresh vegetables, cartons of yogurt, skim milk. Why did anyone want to skim milk? A question for another time.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t find any beer, but pulled out an open bottle of California chardonnay. \"Glasses?\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" She pushed at her hair as she turned to a cabinet. It was manners that had her reaching for glasses, he thought. She\u0027d have been happier if he\u0027d dried his hands and said good night. So she could think, and so she could handle whatever was going on herself. Tough for her, he decided. He wasn\u0027t built that way.\\n\\n He poured the wine himself, sat at the little table. Which, he knew, left her trapped by those manners into sitting down with him.\\n\\n \"I appreciate you dealing with that,\" she began. \"I hate knowing I\u0027m squeamish enough to balk at doing it myself.\"\\n\\n \"Who dealt with the rat?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I did-with a lot of embarrassing squealing and shuddering.\\n\\n I called Carter about the snake. That, apparently, went over my level.\"\\n\\n \"Have you reported this?\"\\n\\n She puffed out her cheeks. \"I assumed that some cat dumped the rodent out in the courtyard. I didn\u0027t think about it. I initially thought the same about the snake, until Carter said its head was crushed, which is when I had a talk with the mother of the leader of the neighborhood hellions. But it wasn\u0027t him. Neither was this. So, yes, I\u0027ll take that thing in tomorrow, and I\u0027ll report it and have it checked out.\"\\n\\n \"Anyone got any reason to hassle you other than Meeks?\"\\n\\n She took a sip of wine. \"You\u0027re quick.\"\\n\\n \"Not a big leap, Phoebe. Sounds like this Arnie needs a talking-to.\" Not just quick, she realized. Furious. Quietly, coldly and absolutely furious. \"A talking-to isn\u0027t what you mean, and it isn\u0027t for you. It isn\u0027t.\" she said firmly. \"I find the sentiment... Well, to be honest, I don\u0027t quite know how I find the sentiment, but we\u0027ll come back to that sometime. The point is, if indeed Arnie Meeks needs a talking-to, it\u0027s best done in an unofficially official way. If you go getting in his face as my...\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to have to come up with a term,\" Duncan said dryly, \"as you object to \u0027boyfriend.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Anyway, it\u0027d put his back up and it makes me look weak. If he\u0027s doing this, I can\u0027t afford to look weak, I can\u0027t give him the satisfaction of believing it\u0027s given me any particular bad moments.\"\\n\\n \"But it has.\"\\n\\n \"I wish I could say otherwise. I think...\"\\n\\n \"Think what?\"\\n\\n She drank again. She wasn\u0027t used to talking to anyone about her own business. Not difficult business. The priority was to keep the house a safe zone. \"I think there might\u0027ve been someone watching the house. I caught a glimpse a couple of times, or more heard. He whistles.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry? He whistles?\"\\n\\n \"I know, it sounds odd and off. But I think someone\u0027s been around the neighborhood a few times, walking by the house, whistling this same tune. If it\u0027s Meeks-and I didn\u0027t get a close enough look to say, either way-he\u0027s taking a huge chance for more payback. He might\u0027ve put a friend up to it, or paid someone. But it\u0027s a big and foolish risk.\"\\n\\n \"He got a big kick in the ass. Could be worth it to him. These things can escalate, can\u0027t they?\"\\n\\n \"They can, of course.\" She glanced up, seeing in her mind\u0027s eye her family tucked safe away for the night. \"I\u0027m not discounting the possibility. I\u0027ll talk to the people I need to, first thing in the morning.\"\\n\\n \"I can bunk here. Spare room, spare couch.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a nice offer. But if you do, I\u0027d have to explain it in the morning. At this point, I don\u0027t want to give anyone, especially my mother, something more to worry about. She\u0027s holding. My getting hurt, and then the shooting, those were hard knocks for her. I don\u0027t think she\u0027s been out in the courtyard for the last few days. I can\u0027t stand to think she\u0027ll lose that, too.\"\\n\\n Duncan studied his glass, had another long sip of wine. \"I believe\\n\\n I\u0027ve had too much to drink. I don\u0027t think I should drive. As a duly authorized officer of the law, and as my current hostess, you should discourage me from doing so.\"\\n\\n Those soft blue eyes, those clear and sober eyes, met hers. \"It\u0027s as simple as that, Phoebe, if you let it be.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know why men think women can\u0027t defend themselves or their home.\"\\n\\n He only smiled. \"Do I need to explain the power of the penis to you-so soon after you\u0027ve experienced its wonder?\"\\n\\n She tapped her fingers on the table. \"You can have Steve\u0027s-Ava\u0027s son\u0027s-room for the night. But if it\u0027s all the same to you, we won\u0027t use your drunken behavior as the reason. It just got late, and seemed easier for you to stay than to drive all the way back to the island.\"\\n\\n \"Fine. We\u0027ll save my drunken behavior for another occasion. Can I ask something that\u0027s none of my business?\"\\n\\n \"As long as the answer can be that\u0027s none of your business, sure you can.\"\\n\\n \"Is Essie getting any therapy?\"\\n\\n \"She was,\" Phoebe said on a long sigh. \"As it\u0027s difficult, even with agoraphobia, to get a therapist who\u0027ll make house calls, most of it was by phone. There were regular weekly phone sessions for a while, and she tried medications. We thought she was making progress.\"\\n\\n \"But?\"\\n\\n \"Her therapist encouraged her to go out. Just ten minutes, outside the house, to somewhere familiar. They picked Forsythe Park. She\u0027d just walk over to the fountain and back home. She made it over, she got over, and then had a major panic attack. One of the fears is being caught in public, or embarrassed in public, or trapped. She couldn\u0027t get her breath, couldn\u0027t find her way back. I\u0027d gone after her. I watched her walk over, and went out behind her when she was nearly out of sight. So it took me a while to get to her once she panicked.\"\\n\\n She could see it, still see it perfectly. Her mother terrified and disoriented, and her own heart banging in her chest as she sprinted over pavement and grass, pushed aside stunned tourists to reach her. \"She was gasping for air, and running. She fell. It was terrible for her. People were trying to help her, but it scared her so much, humiliated her so much.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n \"I got her back. Held on tight, had her close her eyes, and I walked her back. She hasn\u0027t been beyond the courtyard since. That was four years ago. She wouldn\u0027t go back into therapy afterward. Gets testy about it,\" Phoebe added with a little smile. \"She\u0027s fine in the house. She\u0027s happy in the house. Why can\u0027t we leave her alone? So we do. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s the right thing, but we do.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s right enough. Sometimes the right thing changes, so you have to do what\u0027s right for now.\"\\n\\n She thought about that after she showed him where he could sleep, after digging up a spare toothbrush and making sure the towels were fresh and plentiful.\\n\\n The right thing changed, that was true. And sometimes what you thought was right ended up being a wrong turn but a necessary one. She wasn\u0027t sure if Duncan was the right thing or a wrong turn, but she\u0027d fallen in love with him.\\n\\n Had probably stubbed her toe on that the first time she\u0027d seen him, then tripped a little when she\u0027d sat in the pub, laughing with him and enjoying the music. Another little stumble here, a loss of balance there, and the fall was inevitable.\\n\\n Now, she supposed, she had to figure out what the right thing was, and how to do it. For now.\\n\\n A big perk to waking up the lone guy in a household of women, Duncan decided, was the big, home-cooked breakfast. It didn\u0027t suck to be fussed over, either, like the newly crowned prince of Femaleland while he enjoyed coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice.\\n\\n Ava managed the morning stove, and by his gauge that was the general routine. But due to manly company, Essie set out what he figured were the good dishes, with coordinating linen napkins.\\n\\n Essie fussed, filling a fancy sugar bowl and creamer, pouring freshly squeezed juice into a sparkling pitcher, rounding up a little squat bottle of zinnias. He could only assume, as the tasks had her all but bouncing around the kitchen, she was having as good a time as he was.\\n\\n \"Now don\u0027t pester Duncan, Carly. He hasn\u0027t even finished his first cup of coffee yet.\"\\n\\n \"Great coffee,\" Duncan said.\\n\\n \"How come I\u0027m not having cereal?\" Carly wanted to know. \"Because Ava\u0027s making omelets. But you can have cereal if that\u0027s what you want.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care.\"\\n\\n Duncan gave Carly a poke in the ribs. Despite the pout, she looked pretty as a picture in a ruffly yellow shirt and blue pants. \"Hard day at the office coming up?\"\\n\\n She rolled her eyes in his direction. \"I go to school. And we have to take an arithmetic test today. I don\u0027t see why we have to multiply and divide all the time. It\u0027s just numbers. They don\u0027t do anything.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t like numbers? I love numbers. Numbers are a thing of beauty.\"\\n\\n Carly sniffed. \"I don\u0027t need numbers. I\u0027m going to be an actress. Or a personal shopper.\"\\n\\n \"Well, if you\u0027re an actress how are you going to count your lines?\" Duncan considered earning a second eye roll a badge of honor. \"Anybody can count.\"\\n\\n \"Only with the beauty of numbers. Then you have to figure out how much you\u0027re going to make-so you can buy that house in Malibuafter you pay your agent her percentage, and pay your bodyguards so the paparazzi don\u0027t hound you. You got to have yourself an entourage, kid, and do the math so you can call up that personal shopper when it\u0027s time for the Oscars.\"\\n\\n Carly considered. \"Maybe I\u0027ll just be the personal shopper. Then I only have to know about clothes. I know about clothes already.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s your commission?\"\\n\\n This time he got a frown instead of an eye roll. \"I don\u0027t know what that is.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s how much you make when you sell Jennifer Aniston that vin tage Chanel gown. You get a cut of what it costs. So say it costs five thousand, and you get ten percent. Plus, she needs shoes, and a purse thing. So what\u0027s your commission? Gotta do the math.\"\\n\\n Her eyes narrowed now. \"I get something every time they buy something? I get money, every time?\"\\n\\n \"Pretty sure that\u0027s how it works.\"\\n\\n Interest lit her face and banished the pout. \"I don\u0027t know how to do percent.\"\\n\\n \"I do. Got paper?\"\\n\\n When Phoebe walked in, her family was circled around the table. Creamy omelets, fancy strips of Ava\u0027s masterful French toast, crisp bacon invited healthy appetites to tuck right in.\\n\\n Duncan ate with his left hand while Carly, her chair scooted up beside his, leaned over his rapidly scribbling right.\\n\\n \"She needs earrings! She has to have earrings, too.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. How much for the ear dangles?\"\\n\\n \"A million dollars!\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the Satan of personal shoppers.\" He flicked a glance up, smiled. \"Morning.\"\\n\\n \"Mama! We\u0027re doing percent, so I can figure out how much I\u0027ll make when I\u0027m a personal shopper. I already made six thousand dollars on commission.\"\\n\\n \"Jennifer Aniston\u0027s up for an Oscar,\" Ava explained. \"She needs to be outfitted, of course.\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"And needs ensembles for various appearances.\"\\n\\n Phoebe walked around to read the list Duncan had going. \"Jen\u0027s on quite the spree.\"\\n\\n \"Numbers are fun.\"\\n\\n Phoebe gaped at her daughter. \"I think I\u0027ve walked into a parallel universe, one where numbers are fun and there\u0027s omelets on Tuesday mornings.\"\\n\\n \"Sit right down,\" Essie told her. \"We\u0027ve kept yours warm in the oven.\"\\n\\n Phoebe checked her watch. \"I guess I\u0027ve got time to force down a few bites. Numbers are fun,\" she repeated as she sat on the other side of her daughter. \"How come they weren\u0027t fun when I made little bunnies and kittens out of them to show you how they multiplied?\"\\n\\n \"Numbers are more fun when they\u0027re money.\"\\n\\n Phoebe picked up her coffee, shook her head. \"Mind yourself with this one, Duncan. She\u0027s a gold digger.\"\\n\\n \"She picks up a couple more clients like Jen here, she\u0027s going to be supporting me. Look how pretty you are in the morning. Even prettier than Ava\u0027s omelets-which is going some. I expect there isn\u0027t a man in Savannah with a better view than I\u0027ve got here in this kitchen.\" Phoebe\u0027s brows winged up. \"What did you put in his omelet, Ava?\"\\n\\n \"Whatever it was, I\u0027ll make sure it goes in every time.\"\\n\\n He ate cold cereal straight out of the box and washed it down with bitter black coffee. He hadn\u0027t shaved that morning. He hadn\u0027t showered.\\n\\n He knew he was standing on the slippery edge of a bout of depression. He wanted the anger back. The anger and the purpose. They could get lost in that blue pit of depression, he knew. He\u0027d lost them before. There was medication, duly prescribed. But he preferred the speed he\u0027d bought from a friend of a friend. Still, he knew the uppers were a bad choice. He could do the rash and the reckless with that heady juice rushing through him.\\n\\n He\u0027d already done the reckless, hadn\u0027t he? Plugging that idiot rabbit was one thing. But he should\u0027ve saved it-a few days in the freezer, then he could\u0027ve dumped it on Phoebe anytime in the dead of night. He\u0027d nearly gotten caught by rushing it. But he\u0027d been so pissed off! She wasn\u0027t taking the heat for Johnson. Not from the department, not from the press, not from the public. The stupid fucker\u0027s mother had made Phoebe her new best friend. And that maudlin, that pitiful statement outside the funeral home played over and over on the news, on the talk shows.\\n\\n Made that fumbling bitch look like Mother fucking Teresa instead of the ambitious, grasping, stumbling cunt she was.\\n\\n He\u0027d let the anger take over-always a mistake. He\u0027d let it rule so he\u0027d driven straight to her house, tossed the corpse up. He\u0027d meant it to land on the veranda but his hand had been shaking with rage, and his aim was short.\\n\\n He\u0027d nearly gone after it, had started to, when light spilled out of the house next door.\\n\\n He could see himself-humiliated even now-hiding in the bushes while that crazy bitch walked out with her ugly excuse for a dog. And he knew, he knew she walked that dog right at dusk, every single night. He knew, but he hadn\u0027t used the knowledge. He\u0027d only used the anger.\\n\\n And what if that crazy woman or her ugly excuse for a dog had seen him? It wasn\u0027t time for that yet.\\n\\n He\u0027d actually imagined killing them both. Snapping necks like celery stalks and leaving them on Phoebe\u0027s front steps.\\n\\n But it wasn\u0027t the time.\\n\\n He had a plan. A plan and a purpose. An agenda.\\n\\n Now the rage was gone, and the purpose was blurred with a damning sense of failure. He\u0027d wasted his time on that Posse asshole. Taken a stupid risk and wasted bullets.\\n\\n It meant nothing.\\n\\n He looked around his workshop and nearly wept with despair. None of it meant anything. He\u0027d lost what mattered, and she\u0027d lost nothing. Now he was reduced to leaving dead animals on her doorstep.\\n\\n He should\u0027ve killed the crazy old woman and her dog, he decided. Coulda, shoulda. That would\u0027ve made a statement.\\n\\n He took out one of the little black pills, studied it. Just one, he thought. Just one to give him back some juice.\\n\\n Because it was time to make a statement. Time to stop screwing around and kick it all up a notch.\\n\\n Johnson hadn\u0027t put a hitch in her step. Something else-or somebody else-would.\\n\\n \"Twenty-two caliber.\" The criminalist, a skinny guy named Ottis, held the slug up with gloved fingers. \"You gonna kill da wabbit, this is plenty hot enough.\"\\n\\n \"Single shot?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" Ottis frowned at Phoebe. \"Do you want me to run it through ballistics? Ah, do any trace on the... vie?\"\\n\\n \"Actually, I would. If someone\u0027s playing a prank, I\u0027m not laughing. And I think it\u0027s more than that. So anything you can tell me about the bunny or the bullet would be helpful.\"\\n\\n \"Sure, no problem. I\u0027ll get back to you.\"\\n\\n She went back to her office and wrote up an official incident report. Then she took a copy out to Sykes\u0027s desk, filled him in.\\n\\n \"Do you want me to go have a conversation with Arnie?\"\\n\\n \"No, at least not yet. I\u0027d like you to pull a few lines, if you can. Find out how he\u0027s handling the security job, get a sense of his routine. See if you can find out if he\u0027s been spending any time in my neighborhood. He\u0027s got a mouth,\" Phoebe added. \"If he\u0027s messing with me, he\u0027s probably bragged about it to someone. Someone he drinks with or works with.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll poke around.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks. Thank you, Bull.\"\\n\\n Best she could do, Phoebe decided. But not all she could do. Back in her office, she wrote up a log, listing the times and dates, the incidents she believed were connected. To these she added her own speculations.\\n\\n Rat-symbol-snitch, turncoat, deserting sinking ship. Snake-symbol-evil, sneaky, bringer of ruin to Paradise. Rabbit-symbol-cowardly, running away.\\n\\n Might be taking it all too far, psychologically, she mused, but it was better to err on the side of caution than to just err.\\n\\n Whistling keeps the voice disguised, anonymous. What does the song mean? Do not forsake me. Who was forsaken? Who did or might do the forsaking?\\n\\n . One man standing up against corruption and cowardice\\n\\n (rabbit as cowardice?). Rat as desertion of townspeople. Snake as corruption. Cooper as sheriff (wasn\u0027t he? Rent the damn movie), standing alone in the final showdown.\\n\\n Was it about the movie or just the song? she wondered.

After observing her coax one of his employees down from a roof ledge, he is committed to keeping this intriguing, take-charge woman in his life. She\u0027s used to working solo, but Phoebe\u0027s discovering that no amount of negotiation can keep Duncan at arm\u0027s length. \\n And when she\u0027s grabbed by a man who throws a hood over her head and brutally assaults her-in her own precinct house-Phoebe can\u0027t help but be deeply shaken. Then threatening messages show up on her doorstep, and she\u0027s not just alarmed but frustrated.
