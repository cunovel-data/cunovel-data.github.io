{"id":75272,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"She\u0027d told him to go home. It pissed him off What the hell did she take him for?\\n\\n Duncan paced the area outside her squad room. He couldn\u0027t sit; he couldn\u0027t settle, and he wished to God he couldn\u0027t think. Unfortunately, he could, and his mind kept sneaking back to that moment, that ohmyjesusgod moment when what had been a man had become... nothing.\\n\\n Bits and pieces of meat and bone, and something like a horrible red fog.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t remember, not exactly, moving. He remembered feeling something-like a quick punch of air, and the sounds, whizzing and shouting, thunks-thunks of statuary and earth and God knew hitting trees and ground, other stones and statuary.\\n\\n He knew he\u0027d seen a piece of what had been Roy hanging in the lacy webs of Spanish moss. He thought he\u0027d seen the stone angel\u0027s disembodied head fly, her face splattered with red, her smile peaceful and serene. But he might\u0027ve imagined it.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t remember running, walking, jumping toward Phoebe.\\n\\n Just being there, he remembered just being there on top of her while the chaos boomed around them. He remembered hearing her say: What have I done? She said it over and over until someone-Dave, he thought, the captain-had pushed at him, pulled at them.\\n\\n Are you hurt? Are you hit? That\u0027s what he\u0027d asked first, Duncan was nearly sure of that. His face had been as white as the flying angel\u0027s. It blurred some after that. Lots of movement, lots of sound, more sirens.\\n\\n And she\u0027d told him to go. She\u0027d stood in the middle of that nightmare and told him to go. Fuck that.\\n\\n She was in with the captain, that\u0027s what they\u0027d told him. In with Captain McVee and some others. So he\u0027d wait. He\u0027d goddamn wait. He wanted a drink. He wanted to be sick. He wanted to touch her just to assure himself one more time they\u0027d both come through it whole. But all he could do was wait.\\n\\n \"Dune.\"\\n\\n He turned, and his stomach did one hard shudder when he saw Phin striding from the elevator. For reasons he couldn\u0027t explain, seeing his friend had his legs going weak enough to have him sinking down onto a bench.\\n\\n \"Jesus. Oh Christ.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re okay?\" Phin took a hard grip on Duncan\u0027s arm as he sat beside him. \"You\u0027re bleeding. Are you okay?\"\\n\\n Dully, Duncan looked down at his shirt. \"It\u0027s not my blood.\" Just a little souvenir from Bonaventure, a little memento of Roy. \"But I think I\u0027ve got a ways to go before I get within shouting distance of okay. Jesus, Phin. Fucking Christ Jesus.\"\\n\\n \"What the hell happened? Do they know what the hell happened?\"\\n\\n \"He blew up. He just... It\u0027s not like the movies. Man, it\u0027s not like that.\" He pushed a hand through his hair. \"Loo? The kids?\"\\n\\n \"Fine. Kids are sleeping. We got cops around the house. This was Carly\u0027s father?\"\\n\\n \"Roy. Roy Squire. Had him chained to the ground on a grave, strapped with explosives. Poor son of a bitch. Something about being grabbed out of his own garage, beaten up some, maybe drugged. Phoebe was talking to the guy who did it through Roy-the ex. He had, ah...\" Duncan made a helpless gesture at his ear.\\n\\n \"Okay, I get it.\" Studying his friend\u0027s face, Phin pulled a flask out of his hip pocket. \"Take a slug, brother.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d kiss you for this, but I\u0027m not feeling romantic.\" Grateful,\\n\\n Duncan took the flask and swallowed straight whiskey. \"He wasRoy-he was crying, begging. The guy... Cooper,\" Duncan remembered. \"He told Phoebe to call him Cooper. He wouldn\u0027t say what he wanted, he wouldn\u0027t say why. Then he must\u0027ve told Roy to say goodbye. And he pushed the button, he set off the bomb. He blew apart, Phin. Fuck, he just blew apart.\"\\n\\n \"Duncan, did you set the security before you left your house?\"\\n\\n \"What? No.\" Had he? No. \"We were out of there too fast.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, here\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do. I\u0027m going to make some calls, get some people over there to do a sweep and to secure the place.\" Duncan let his head fall back. \"Because he went after Phoebe\u0027s ex, he may come after me.\"\\n\\n \"No point in being sloppy, is there?\"\\n\\n \"No, no point.\"\\n\\n In the office, Phoebe sat ramrod straight. Her family was safe, and their homes under guard. She could put that worry out of her mind. Roy was dead; she couldn\u0027t change that. She had to block that guilt out of her mind, her heart, her belly.\\n\\n \"Hilton Head PD is investigating. They\u0027ve got a crime-scene unit going over the house and garage. We\u0027re looking for the victim\u0027s car.\"\\n\\n \"The grave has to be symbolic of something or someone.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re getting the information.\"\\n\\n \"I need my family protected, not just for tonight-\"\\n\\n \"Phoebe.\" Dave spoke quietly. \"They will be.\"\\n\\n \"All right. He was engaged. I only know her first name-Mizzy. I don\u0027t know if they were living together or-\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll be taken care of.\"\\n\\n Of course, yes, of course it would. \"A personal attack of this na ture has to stem from a personal grudge. Who have I pissed off, hurt, threatened?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll need to speak to Arnold Meeks.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\" She drew a deep breath. \"He needs to be interviewed and his whereabouts confirmed. But this wasn\u0027t his doing. He was a bad cop, he\u0027s no doubt a violent man, and a complete asshole. But he\u0027s not a killer. If what this Cooper told me tonight is fact, he\u0027s killed at least twice now. In cold blood. Meeks acts in rage, short-term planning, without factoring in the consequences.\"\\n\\n \"Someone acting on his behest. With or without his knowledge.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe. But I think it\u0027s more personal yet. You hurt me, I\u0027ll hurt you, and a whole lot worse. Something I did or didn\u0027t do. Someone I didn\u0027t save.\"\\n\\n When she closed her eyes, pressed her fingers against her lids, all she could see was Roy. She dropped her hands into her lap. \"A failure, a professional failure that was personal to him. Who did I lose, Dave? When?\\n\\n How? I need to go back over my case files, all the way back. Any hostage or hostage-takers, any cop or bystander, anyone who was injured or killed during an incident where I was negotiator.\\n\\n \"I think it\u0027s going to be a woman,\" she added. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because he\u0027s Gary Cooper. Because Roy was chained to a woman\u0027s grave. We can\u0027t discount anyone, but I think it\u0027s going to be a woman. He knows, or he\u0027s learned how to handle, weapons and explosives. Maybe he was trained in the military or law enforcement. Or maybe he trained himself. Because he planned this. Roy wasn\u0027t impulse, not spur of the moment.\"\\n\\n She pounded her fisted hand on her thigh. \"I couldn\u0027t hear. How could I listen and know how to respond, know how to bring him down when I couldn\u0027t hear his voice, the inflection, the emotion?\"\\n\\n \"Phoebe, you\u0027re not responsible for this.\"\\n\\n \"Then why did he set it off? Did I ask the wrong question, choose the wrong tack? All the time, trouble, the risk he took to get Roy where he wanted him, to get me there, then he ends it? I have to listen to the tape, I have to figure out what I said-or didn\u0027t say-what pushed him to end it.\"\\n\\n He swiveled his chair until they were knee-to-knee, face-to-face. \"You know better than that.\"\\n\\n \"Under normal circumstances, we all try to know better than that. But this wasn\u0027t normal circumstances. It was about me this time.\"\\n\\n \"What you said or didn\u0027t may not be the answer.\"\\n\\n \"No. He\u0027s killed two people, because of their connection to me. I have to know why. We have to find the answer, Dave, because he has no reason to stop at two. He\u0027s been outside my house.\" She closed her eyes again. \"He may try for someone I love next.\"\\n\\n \"He won\u0027t get near them.\"\\n\\n \"He can\u0027t once we identify him, find him, stop him. I... I need to contact Roy\u0027s fiancee. And I have to tell Carly. I have to find a way to tell Carly.\"\\n\\n \"What you have to do right now is go home, get some sleep. Take a little time, Phoebe. It might be a good idea for you to talk to the counselor about this.\"\\n\\n \"The best cure for guilt and misplaced responsibility in the negotiator is work, study and training.\" She managed a ghost of a smile. \"Someone wise has been known to say that, often.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I have, but in this case, you need sleep first. We\u0027ll talk about the rest of it later.\"\\n\\n When she walked out of Dave\u0027s office, she went straight into the women\u0027s room and finally let herself be sick. Viciously, violently sick. Emptied out, skin clammy, eyes running, she sat back against the stall door until she got her breath back. She didn\u0027t weep. This had gone far beyond anything as simple and cleansing as tears. She simply sat on the floor, back braced, until she was sure she wouldn\u0027t be sick again. Then, after rising, she walked to the sink to wash her face, to rinse out her mouth with cupped handfuls of cold water. He\u0027d been looking into her eyes, she thought as she lifted her head to look into her own now. He\u0027d been looking straight into her eyes, his full of fear and pleas, this man she\u0027d once loved. This man she\u0027d made a child with.\\n\\n Then he was gone. Gone, she thought, because she once loved him and made a child with him. Not for his own sins, but because she met him one night at a party, and let herself love.\\n\\n So she\u0027d find the answers. She\u0027d search until she found them.\\n\\n After drying her face, shoving her dampened hair away from it, she started toward her office. She\u0027d go home-Dave was right about that. But she\u0027d take some files with her. The odds of getting any real sleep were slim, so she could work off the hours, and maybe find some answers. She didn\u0027t see Duncan until he was pushing to his feet and walking toward her.\\n\\n \"You should\u0027ve gone home.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t even start that crap with me, okay?\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Goddamn it, Phoebe.\" He took her arms. Then he just jerked her against him. \"Okay, fight later. Let\u0027s just do this for a minute.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m sorry you had to go through that.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, me, too, and back at you.\" He eased her back to take a good study of her face. Her eyes were reddened, shadowed, exhausted. \"I\u0027ll take you on home now.\"\\n\\n No car, she remembered. She didn\u0027t have her car. \"I have to get a few things out of my office first.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll wait.\"\\n\\n \"Duncan-\" She broke off when she saw Phin coming toward them, clicking his cell phone closed. \"Carly.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s fine. She\u0027s fine.\" Phin kept walking, opened his arms and took Phoebe in. \"She\u0027s sound asleep. Got a patrol car out in front of the house, another couple cops out the back, and my fierce wife and lovely dog inside.\"\\n\\n It surprised a muffled laugh out of her. \"Thank you. I should go by and get her, bring her home.\"\\n\\n \"Honey, it\u0027s four in the morning. Since it was damn near midnight before the giggling stopped, I bet those girls are going to be sleeping a few hours yet. Why don\u0027t Loo and I bring her home after she\u0027s up and around? We\u0027ll call you first, then bring her home. How\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"Good. That\u0027s good. No point in waking her up to... No point.\\n\\n I\u0027m grateful, Phin, grateful to you and Loo, and I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n \"No need to be either about this.\"\\n\\n \"I need to get a few things. I\u0027ll only be a minute.\" Phin watched her go. \"She holds up pretty good.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s got that strong spine. Something that appealed to me right off. Everything okay on the home front?\"\\n\\n \"Taken care of. I\u0027m going to go on. You get some sleep, you hear. We\u0027ll talk about all this later.\"\\n\\n Duncan gave him a bump on the shoulder. \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n When Phoebe came back, Duncan stepped over to take her overloaded briefcase. \"Good idea. You\u0027re going to work from home for a while.\"\\n\\n \"Not instead of, in addition to.\"\\n\\n \"Only so many hours in the day, Phoebe.\"\\n\\n \"So I need to make good use of as many as I can. This is police business, Duncan.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, don\u0027t pull that crap on me either.\"\\n\\n She remained silent a moment, ordered herself not to respond. But her willpower snapped when they stepped off the elevator. \"I seem to be pulling quite a bit of crap on you tonight.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, and I can\u0027t say I care for it.\"\\n\\n \"Then you ought to just go on. I can get my own way home.\"\\n\\n \"In about one more minute, I\u0027m going to take this shovel I\u0027m using to pitch away this crap and hit you over the head with it. I\u0027ve had a bad night, too, Phoebe, so watch where you push.\"\\n\\n \"I told you to go home, didn\u0027t I? I said-\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t say a thing more as the breath whooshed right out of her when he whipped her around and pushed her back against his car. She\u0027d seen him irked a time or two, even seen him on the edge of nasty temper. But this was the first time she saw the full-blown affair.\\n\\n His eyes had the hard, hot look of a man who could and would kick any number of asses, then gesture for more to come on.\\n\\n \"We found out I like aggressive women-thanks for that. I like strong women, and smart women. I like women who can handle themselves. I like, apparently, a woman who knows where the hell she\u0027s going and how she wants to get there. You getting this?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re hurting my arms, Duncan.\"\\n\\n He eased his hold a fraction. \"What I don\u0027t like is being told what to do, or how I should feel or what I should think. I don\u0027t like being fucking dismissed when-\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t mean-\"\\n\\n \"Shut up, Phoebe. I\u0027m not finished. I don\u0027t like being dismissed when a smart, strong, knows-how-to-handle-herself woman figures she doesn\u0027t need me anymore. I don\u0027t like, and I won\u0027t tolerate, being told it\u0027s none of my non-police ass\u0027s business when I stood out there tonight and saw that poor bastard blown to pieces. So go ahead, Phoebe, tell me one more time to go on home.\"\\n\\n Her breath shuddered out once before she controlled it. \"I didn\u0027t think I could face you again tonight.\"\\n\\n \"What? Why?\"\\n\\n \"I wasn\u0027t sure... I thought I might break down if I did, or worse, that you\u0027d look at me differently. I don\u0027t know. It\u0027s not rational, it\u0027s emotional, all right? I\u0027ve got plenty of goddamn emotions.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll say. Phoebe, first, if you\u0027d broken down-\"\\n\\n \"I said it wasn\u0027t logical.\" The shove she gave him to push him back had a little heat along with it. \"Don\u0027t stand there trying to make it logical.\"\\n\\n \"Good point.\" He considered a minute, then reached into his back pocket for the flask Phin had given him.\\n\\n \"Oh God. Thank you.\" She took a short sip, then a long drink. \"Oh Jesus.\" She leaned back against the car. \"Oh Jesus, Duncan.\"\\n\\n \"I never...\" He took back the flask for another quick pull. \"It\u0027s not like I ever imagined. What happens to a person.\"\\n\\n \"The bomb guys call it pink mist.\"\\n\\n He capped the flask, opened the car door for her. \"You\u0027ve been through it before?\"\\n\\n \"Not like this.\" She waited until he was behind the wheel. \"I\u0027ve been on teams, a few times, when we weren\u0027t there soon enough, or something went wrong. I\u0027ve never seen... nothing like this. I was so mad at him, I was so angry. About him getting married again and moving to Europe without giving Carly a thought.\" She rubbed the heels of her hands on her eyes. \"I think it\u0027s worse, it\u0027s worse having those feelings in me for him than if we\u0027d managed to be friends, or at least friendly. But that\u0027s what I had in me for him.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not what I saw out there at Bonaventure. You weren\u0027t thinking about how mad you were. You were thinking about saving his life.\"\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t think hard enough. And that\u0027s destructive,\" she said before he could speak. \"I know it. It\u0027s indulgent and egotistical. Duncan, are you going to consider it more crap if I tell you it\u0027s best if we don\u0027t see each other for a while? If I tell you because the man who killed Roy may decide it\u0027s more fun to go after someone current in my life, it\u0027s best if there\u0027s some distance between us.\"\\n\\n \"Plenty of distance between you and Roy.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but-\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d consider it crap. And if I give you the respect of admiring the fact you can handle yourself, I\u0027d appreciate the quid pro quo.\" She said nothing, just pulled out her badge as they approached her house. \"Let me ID us to the radio car first.\" She stepped out, crossed over.\\n\\n He waited by the car while she had a brief conversation. She\u0027d have noticed, he assumed, that there were lights on inside the house. No one, it seemed, was getting a good night\u0027s sleep.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not telling you to go home,\" she began, \"because I don\u0027t want to get beaned with that shovel. I\u0027m just going to tell you that you don\u0027t have to stay.\"\\n\\n In answer he simply took her hand. Ava opened the door as they stepped onto the veranda. \"I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re home!\" She dashed out barefoot to wrap her arms around Phoebe. \"They said you weren\u0027t hurt.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not. Mama?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m here.\" Her face gray, Essie stood a foot back from the open door. \"Phoebe. Phoebe.\"\\n\\n So the veranda was lost to her, for now, Phoebe thought, and moved into the house quickly to take her mother into her arms. \"I\u0027m fine. I promise.\"\\n\\n \"They said there was trouble, something bad. Carly-\"\\n\\n \"Is fine. You know she\u0027s fine. She\u0027s sleeping.\"\\n\\n \"And... and Carter and-\"\\n\\n \"Mama. Mama. You need to breathe. You need to keep breathing. Look at me now, and you listen. Everyone is fine. Carter and Josie and\\n\\n Carly. You and Ava. I\u0027m right here, too. Duncan\u0027s here. He brought me home.\"\\n\\n Even as she spoke, Phoebe could see her mother was falling into a panic attack. Her breath was short and choppy-quick, strained indrawn gasps. The shakes had started. Sweat beaded on Essie\u0027s face.\\n\\n \"Ava.\"\\n\\n Together, Phoebe and Ava eased Essie down to the floor before her legs buckled.\\n\\n \"Mama. I\u0027m right here, Mama. Feel my hand?\" She glanced up as Duncan draped the throw from the back of the parlor sofa over Essie\u0027s shaking shoulders. \"Feel my hands, Mama? Rubbing your arms? Hear my voice? Take a nice breath now.\"\\n\\n It eased, bit by stingy bit, minute by endless minute.\\n\\n \"All right now, all right.\" Phoebe drew Essie close, stroking her hair. \"Nice deep breaths now. There you are.\"\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t stop it. I\u0027m so sorry, Phoebe.\"\\n\\n \"Ssh. Ssh. It\u0027s all over now.\"\\n\\n \"Here, Essie, why don\u0027t you drink a little water?\"\\n\\n Essie looked over as Duncan crouched to offer a glass. \"Oh, Duncan. I\u0027m so embarrassed.\"\\n\\n \"Sip a little water. I\u0027m going to go make y\u0027all some tea.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, but-\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not going to make me feel like company, are you, Essie?\" A tear dripped down her cheek as she shook her head. \"Phoebe, I\u0027m so sorry. I\u0027m so sorry. You shouldn\u0027t have to come home and worry like this about me. You look so tired.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re all tired. Come on now, Ava and I are going to get you up and get you to the sofa.\"\\n\\n \"Ava, you should go in and make that tea. That poor man. What must he think of this household?\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry about Duncan.\" Ava helped Essie to the sofa. \"Are you cold?\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m fine now. I-\" She passed a hand over her face and grimaced at the sweat. \"Look at me! Like I had the mother of all hot flashes.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to get you a cool cloth.\"\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t stop it,\" Essie told Phoebe when they were alone. \"I know.\"\\n\\n \"You wish I\u0027d take the medicine, but most of the time I\u0027m fine the way things are. I was just so worried. We were both so worried. Then wouldn\u0027t you know when you\u0027re home and I know you\u0027re safe, I have a spell like that.\"\\n\\n She reached out, touched Phoebe\u0027s face. \"Something very bad happened.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, something very bad. Mama, I\u0027ve got some of the pills. You could take one. I don\u0027t want you upset.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m all right now. You said Carly and Carter and Josie weren\u0027t hurt. Or Dave?\"\\n\\n \"Dave\u0027s fine.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. Okay. I\u0027ll be all right with anything else.\"\\n\\n Ava came back with a small white basin and a damp cloth. \"You better sit down, Ava.\"\\n\\n She told them about Roy. Though Essie\u0027s face went sheet white again, she didn\u0027t have another attack. She and Ava sat together on the couch, gripping hands. Duncan said nothing when he came in, just passed around the tea, then sat while Phoebe finished.\\n\\n It was Essie who rose to sit on the arm of Phoebe\u0027s chair. She put her arm around her daughter\u0027s shoulders, eased Phoebe\u0027s head against her and stroked.\\n\\n \"Oh, Mama.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, baby. I\u0027m so sorry. What a terrible thing. Poor Roy. Poor Roy. The man was useless as tits on a bull, but he didn\u0027t deserve to die like that.\"\\n\\n \"Mama!\"\\n\\n \"People who say not to speak ill of the dead are hypocrites, because you can take it to the bank they\u0027re thinking ill.\"\\n\\n Essie looked over, saw Duncan struggling against a grin. \"And look at you, just worn out, too, aren\u0027t you? But the house is all locked up. Locked up tight and we\u0027re safe inside it. You need to rest awhile.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, we all need to rest.\" Phoebe took Essie\u0027s hand. \"I\u0027d never let anyone hurt you.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll all go rest. Duncan, you\u0027re going to stay. It\u0027s safe in the house, so you\u0027ll stay. Come on, baby girl. Duncan\u0027s going to stay in with you so you\u0027re not alone. You\u0027ll sleep better.\"\\n\\n When Phoebe lifted her eyebrows, Essie just shook her head and continued to walk her out of the parlor. \"As if I had no idea the two of you haven\u0027t found your way into bed together already. Sun\u0027s going to be up before long. We\u0027ll all get some rest. We\u0027ll have a late breakfast.\" Ava nodded at Phoebe over Essie\u0027s head, then slid an arm around Essie\u0027s waist. \"Eggs Benedict? Won\u0027t that be fine, Essie? And fresh berries.\" Phoebe sighed as Ava walked her mother down the hall to Essie\u0027s bedroom. \"She\u0027s closed the worst of it out of her mind for a while. It\u0027s too big right off, so she keeps it out.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds like a healthy idea to me.\"\\n\\n Phoebe turned into her bedroom. \"If she can keep her mind on something else like eggs Benedict, she won\u0027t panic. But eventually, it\u0027ll claw its way in.\"\\n\\n \"Phoebe.\"\\n\\n She sat on the edge of the bed, looking up wearily as she pulled off her shoes.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d say what happened tonight, and the overall threat of what could happen? That earns a good dose of panic.\"\\n\\n \"Hard to argue. God. I\u0027m too tired to get undressed.\" She simply lay down on top of the spread, curled on her side.\\n\\n Duncan slid in behind her, spooned her. \"Didn\u0027t expect our first overnight would end up with us both fully dressed.\"\\n\\n \"Duncan? I want to say that I appreciate the fact that you shovel away the crap when I get into one of those get-away-and-let-me-dothisall-by-myself spells.\"\\n\\n He smiled into her hair. \"I\u0027m going to buy a couple of spare shovels tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"That sounds like a good idea.\" She took his hand in hers, pressed it between her breasts.\\n\\n And within moments, Essie proved right. Phoebe did sleep better with him there. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/high-noon/page-22.html","bookId":2412,"book":{"id":2412,"title":"High Noon","description":"Storyline: Police Lieutenant Phoebe MacNamara found her calling at an early age when an unstable man broke into her family\u0027s home, trapping and terrorizing them for hours.

She\u0027s used to working solo, but Phoebe\u0027s discovering that no amount of negotiation can keep Duncan at arm\u0027s length. \\n And when she\u0027s grabbed by a man who throws a hood over her head and brutally assaults her-in her own precinct house-Phoebe can\u0027t help but be deeply shaken. Then threatening messages show up on her doorstep, and she\u0027s not just alarmed but frustrated. How do you go face-to-face with an opponent who refuses to look you in the eye? \\n Now, with Duncan backing her up every step of the way, she must establish contact with the faceless tormentor who is determined to make her a hostage to fear . . . before she becomes the final showdown.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/high-noon.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/high-noon.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:34:15 AM"}}
