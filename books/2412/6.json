{"id":75256,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Still, flowers and an evening of girl movies smoothed out a lot of edges. At the end of the marathon, Phoebe carried her sleeping daughter to bed. Any-o\u0027clock made it to just past midnight this time.\n Twenty minutes later, Phoebe was as deeply asleep as her daughter. The sound of the doorbell had her bolting straight up in bed. She rolled out, glancing at the bedside clock-three-fifteen-before snatching up her robe. She was already at the steps and starting down when\n Essie and Ava came out of their rooms.\n \"Was that the doorbell?\" Essie clutched her robe closed at the neck, and her knuckles were white. \"At this hour?\"\n \"Probably just kids fooling around. You stay up here with Carly, okay? In case it woke her.\"\n \"Don\u0027t open the door. Don\u0027t-\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry, Mama.\"\n That twenty-year-old fear, Phoebe knew, was always waiting to push off from the bottom of the dark pool toward the surface.\n \"I\u0027ll go with you. Probably just a couple half-drunk teenagers playing pranks,\" Ava said before Phoebe could object.\n No point in making it bigger than it was, Phoebe decided, and let\n Ava walk down with her. \"She\u0027ll be upset the rest of the night,\" Phoebe murmured.\n \"I\u0027ll see she takes a sleeping pill if she needs it. Stupid kids.\" Phoebe peered through the pattern of textured glass on the panel of the front door and saw nothing. They\u0027d run off, she thought, likely laughing hysterically as kids would over waking up a household. But when she rose to her toes to study the veranda more carefully, she saw it.\n \"Go on up, Ava, tell Mama it was nothing. Just kids being a nuisance.\"\n \"What is it?\" Ava clutched at Phoebe\u0027s arm. \"Is there something out there?\"\n \"Go on up and tell Mama. I don\u0027t want her scared. Tell her I\u0027m just getting a glass of water while I\u0027m down here.\"\n \"What is it? I\u0027ll go up and get Steven\u0027s baseball bat. Don\u0027t you open that door until-\"\n \"Ava, nobody\u0027s out there, but I need to open this door, and I can\u0027t until you go up and tell Mama everything\u0027s fine. She\u0027s working herself up into a state by now. You know she is.\"\n \"Damn it.\" Loyalty to Essie overrode the rest. \"I\u0027m coming right back.\"\n Phoebe waited until Ava was up the stairs before she unlocked the door. She scanned the street-right, left, across-but her gut told her whoever had rung the bell was gone. She had only to crouch down to pick up what lay on the doorstep. Then she shut the door and relocked it before carrying it into the kitchen to set it on the table.\n The doll had bright red hair. It had probably been long hair once but had been crudely hacked off. Whoever had done it had stripped it, bound its hands with clothesline, affixed a square of duct tape across its mouth. Red paint was splattered and smeared over the doll to simulate blood.\n \"Oh my God, Phoebe!\"\n Phoebe held up a hand, continued to study the doll. \"Carly? Mama?\"\n \"Carly slept through it. I told Essie it was nothing, and you were staying down just a little while in case those kids came back so you could give them a scare and a piece of your mind.\"\n \"Good.\"\n \"That horrible thing.\" Ava laid the ball bat she\u0027d snatched out of her son\u0027s closet on the table beside it.\n \"Honey, why don\u0027t you get me the camera from the server drawer? I want to take some pictures for my files.\"\n \"But shouldn\u0027t you call the police?\"\n \"Ava, you\u0027re always forgetting I am the police.\"\n \"But-\"\n \"I\u0027ll be taking it in, but I want my own pictures. Don\u0027t worry, whoever did this isn\u0027t coming back tonight. He delivered the message. And don\u0027t tell Mama about this,\" Phoebe added as she went into the tool drawer for a measuring tape. \"Not yet.\"\n \"Of course I won\u0027t tell her. Phoebe, I wish you\u0027d call Dave. I wish you\u0027d call Dave right now and tell him someone put this thing that\u0027s meant to be you right on the doorstep.\"\n \"I\u0027m not going to wake Dave at this hour. There\u0027s nothing he can do.\" Phoebe rubbed a hand on Ava\u0027s arm as she walked back to the table. \"But I\u0027ll talk to him about it, I promise. Get me that camera now, all right?\"\n She measured, took pictures, then double bagged the doll in plastic, tucked it into a shopping bag and stowed it in the foyer closet.\n Essie called out softly as Phoebe passed her bedroom door. \"Honey? Everything all right?\"\n \"It\u0027s fine.\" Phoebe stopped in Essie\u0027s doorway. Her mother looked so young and vulnerable in the big old bed. \"Excitement\u0027s over for the night. You going to be able to get back to sleep?\"\n \"I think so. Kids pulling pranks. What are you going to do?\"\n \"Don\u0027t let them know it bothered you. \u0027Night, Mama.\"\n In her bedroom, Phoebe set the alarm for six. She\u0027d take the doll into the precinct, file a report, be home again before anyone knew she\u0027d gone out. She\u0027d ask Sykes to look into it. He was solid and smart. If the doll could be traced, he\u0027d trace it.\n Nobody, nobody was going to upset her family.\n As she lay sleepless in the dark, already knowing she wouldn\u0027t need the alarm, she wondered where Arnie Meeks had been at three-fifteen. It had been enough to see the lights come on in her fancy house. Flash, flash, flash. Enough to see that before he\u0027d bolted into the park, into the trees. Into the dark.\n But it had been even better-a nice bonus-to see her open the door and pick up her little present. Worth the time, worth the trouble, yeah, to see her come out for his gift.\n Just some foreplay, bitch, he thought as he drove home. Just a little tickle before the main event.\n He wasn\u0027t nearly finished with Phoebe MacNamara.\n She\u0027d have canceled the date if it wouldn\u0027t have made the incident the night before too important. And if canceling wouldn\u0027t have meant answering a dozen questions from her mother, and even from Carly.\n She\u0027d already answered her share that morning as it had taken her longer than she\u0027d hoped to deliver the evidence, make a report, get home again on the damn CAT. At least she\u0027d had the foresight to wear sweats so she could use the excuse-simply lie, Phoebe admitted-and say she\u0027d gone for an early run in the park.\n Then, of course, Carly had walked her feet off during the afternoon. The battle of wills over the purchase of the \"cutest\" outfit had tried her patience so that she and her daughter were not on the best of terms when they\u0027d returned home-Carly to sulk in her room and Phoebe to escape to the courtyard chaise with a broad-brimmed hat on her head.\n Now she had to go out to dinner, she thought, as, after refusing all opinions, she pulled out her all-purpose black dress. If it was good enough for weddings, funerals and the occasional cocktail party, it was good enough for a dinner date.\n The fashionista gene had skipped a generation, she decided with some irritation, along with the curls and dimples.\n She started to put her hair up, but fiddling with it made her think of the rudely shorn hair on the doll. She left it down. And while she knew her family would have preferred a little time to grill her dateand for Phoebe to make an entrance down the stairs-she made sure she was in the parlor well before seven.\n And at the door first when the bell rang. \"Hello, Duncan.\"\n \"First let me say: Wow. Then, hello, Phoebe.\"\n She stepped back, raised her eyebrows at the nosegay of pink rosebuds he carried. \"You already sent me flowers, which are gorgeous, by the way.\"\n \"Glad you liked them. This isn\u0027t for you.\" He glanced around the foyer. \"I like your house.\"\n \"We do, too.\"\n \"Phoebe, aren\u0027t you going to invite the man past the foyer, introduce him?\" Essie stepped out of the parlor, aimed a smile at Duncan. \"I\u0027m Essie MacNamara, Phoebe\u0027s mother.\"\n \"Ma\u0027am.\" He took the hand she offered. \"It sounds like a line, but has to be said anyway. I can see where Phoebe gets her impressive looks.\"\n \"Thank you. I\u0027m pleased it had to be said. Come on into the parlor.\n My son and his wife aren\u0027t here, but I\u0027ll introduce you to the rest of the family. Ava, this is Phoebe\u0027s friend Duncan.\"\n \"I\u0027m so pleased to meet you.\"\n \"Phoebe didn\u0027t mention so many beauties in the family. She did mention you.\" He smiled over at Carly. \"I went for pink.\" He held out the flowers.\n \"Isn\u0027t that sweet!\" Essie had already melted. \"Carly, this is Mr.\n Swift. And I believe those are your first roses from a gentleman caller.\" The sulky child tumbled into a coy female. \"They\u0027re mine?\"\n \"Unless you hate pink.\"\n \"I like pink.\" She flushed nearly the color of the buds she took from him. \"Thank you. Gran, can I pick a vase for them myself? Can I?\"\n \"Of course you can. Mr. Swift, can I offer you something to drink?\"\n \"Duncan. I-\"\n \"We should go,\" Phoebe interrupted. \"The dazzle in here\u0027s getting blinding.\" She picked up a jacket from the back of a chair. \"I won\u0027t be late.\"\n \"Ouch,\" Duncan said. 84 I\n Ignoring him, Phoebe bent to kiss Carly\u0027s cheek. \"Behave.\"\n \"You enjoy yourselves,\" Essie said. \"And Duncan, you be sure to come back.\"\n \"Thanks. Next time I\u0027ll have to bring a meadow. Nice to meet you all.\"\n Phoebe knew very well there were three faces plastered to the parlor window when Duncan opened the car door for her. She sent him a thoughtful look, then slipped inside.\n She sent him the same look when he got behind the wheel. \"Are you trying to clear the path by charming my daughter?\"\n \"Absolutely. Now that I know about your mother and Ava, I\u0027ll work on them.\"\n \"Now I have to decide whether to appreciate your honesty or be insulted by it.\"\n \"Let me know when you make up your mind. Meanwhile, do you hate boats?\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Because if you hate boats I need to make an adjustment. So, do you?\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t hate boats.\"\n \"Good.\" He nipped out a cell phone, punched a number. \"Duncan. We\u0027re on the way. Good. Great. Thanks.\" He clicked it closed. \"Your daughter looks like your mother. The dimples missed you.\"\n \"To my great sadness.\"\n \"How\u0027s Ava related?\"\n \"Not by blood, but she\u0027s still family.\"\n He nodded in a way that told her he understood completely. \"And you have an older brother.\"\n \"Younger. Carter\u0027s younger.\"\n \"Okay. Do he and his wife live in that great house with you, too?\"\n \"No, they have their own place. What made you think to bring Carly roses?\"\n \"Ah... Well, I don\u0027t know much about seven-year-old girls, and didn\u0027t know if this specific one went for dolls or footballs. There was also the possibility you\u0027re one of those sugar Nazis, so that eliminared the candy route. Figured I sent you flowers, and she\u0027d probably get a kick out of getting some, too. Is there a problem?\"\n \"No. No. I\u0027m complicating it, and it was a sweet gesture. She\u0027ll never forget it. A girl doesn\u0027t forget the first time a man gives her flowers.\"\n \"I don\u0027t have to marry her or anything, do I?\"\n \"Not for another twenty years.\"\n After he\u0027d parked, Phoebe assumed they were going to one of the restaurants along River Street. Something with a view, she supposed, even alfresco dining, which made her glad for the jacket.\n Instead he led her to the pier, past a few boats, and to a graceful, gleaming white sailboat. There was a table on deck under a white cloth. Tea lights under a little dome in the center.\n \"This would be yours.\"\n \"If you hated boats, we were going for pizza, and this relationship would probably have ended with the last pepperoni.\"\n \"Fortunately for me I like boats. I had pizza last night.\"\n She let him help her on board, adjusted to the sway. As first dates went, though she supposed technically this was their second, it had a lot of potential.\n \"Do you do a lot of sailing?\"\n \"I live over on Whitfield Island.\"\n \"Ah.\" That answered that. She walked to the rail, looked across the river. \"Did you always live on Whitfield?\"\n \"No. Didn\u0027t plan to.\" He took a bottle of champagne from the ice bucket, began to work out the cork. \"It just sort of happened and I got to like it.\"\n \"Like winning the lottery.\"\n \"More or less.\"\n She turned at the sound of the cork popping.\n \"So this part?\" he began. \"It\u0027s the showing-off part. The boat, champagne, fancy food-which is under the table in a warming bin. But it\u0027s also because I thought it would be nice to eat out on the water, just you and me.\"\n \"The showing-off part\u0027s a bull\u0027s-eye. The just-you-and-me part is problematic. Not for dinner, but as a concept.\"\n He poured the wine. \"Because?\"\n She leaned back against the rail, wallowing in the breeze and the sway. \"I have layers of complications.\"\n \"Single parent, complex career.\"\n \"Yes.\" She took the wine. \"And more.\"\n \"Such as?\"\n \"Long stories.\"\n \"So you said before. I\u0027m not in any hurry.\"\n \"All right, let\u0027s just start this way. I loved my ex-husband when I married him.\"\n He leaned back with her. \"Always a good plan.\"\n \"I thought so. I loved him very much, even though I knew, I understood going in, we weren\u0027t on equal terms.\"\n \"I don\u0027t get it.\"\n \"He didn\u0027t love me very much. He couldn\u0027t. He just isn\u0027t built for it.\"\n \"Sounds like excuses.\"\n \"No. No. Easier if they were. He was never abusive, never-to my knowledge-unfaithful. But he couldn\u0027t put his whole self into the marriage. I was sure I could fix that, I could work with that. Then I got pregnant. He wasn\u0027t upset or angry. After Carly was born... There was just nothing,\" she said after a moment. \"No connection, no bond, no curiosity. He coasted, we coasted for nearly a year that way. Then he told me he wanted out. He was sorry, but it just wasn\u0027t what he was looking for. He decided he wanted to travel. Roy\u0027s like that. Impulsive. He married me on impulse, agreed to start a family on one. Neither really satisfied him, so, on to the next.\"\n He tucked her hair behind her ear again, just that casual swirl of finger around the curve. \"Does Carly ever see him?\"\n \"No. Really no. And actually handles the situation better than I do. That\u0027s only one complication.\"\n \"Okay, give me another.\"\n \"My mother\u0027s agoraphobic. She hasn\u0027t been out of that house in ten years. She can\u0027t.\"\n \"She didn\u0027t seem-\"\n \"Crazy?\" Phoebe interrupted. \"She\u0027s not.\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t going to say crazy, hair-trigger. I was going to say nervous around strangers. Such as me.\"\n \"It\u0027s not the same thing. In the house, she\u0027s fine. She understands and feels safe inside the house.\"\n \"It must be rough on her.\" He ran the back of his hand down Phoebe\u0027s arm. \"And you.\"\n \"We deal with it. She fought it a long time, about as long as she hasn\u0027t been able to fight it. She fought it for me and my brother. So now Carter and I-and Ava and Carly-deal with it.\"\n \"You\u0027ve got some rough stuff.\" He turned, shifted so he was facing her, so his free hand rested on the rail by her elbow.\n So she could feel him, the pull of him as their eyes met and held.\n \"But I don\u0027t understand what it has to do with you and me as a concept.\" Right that minute, she was trying to understand it herself. \"My family and my work take nearly all my time, all my energy.\"\n \"You may be laboring under the mistaken impression I\u0027m highmaintenance.\" He took her glass, moved back to the bottle. He topped hers off, then his own. When he went back to her, he leaned in first, laid his lips on hers. \"Got a zing going there.\"\n Oh, God, yeah. \"Zings are easy.\"\n \"Have to start somewhere. I like here. Sexy redhead, beautiful night, bubbles in the wine. Hungry?\"\n \"More than I like.\"\n He smiled. \"Why don\u0027t you sit down? There\u0027s supposed to be some sort of cold lobster deal in the cold box inside. I\u0027ll go get it. You can tell me some more long stories while we eat.\"\n She wasn\u0027t going to tell him anything else about her life, her family. Keep it light, she decided. All on the surface. But he had a way, and somehow between the lobster salad and the medallions of beef, she let him in.\n \"I wonder how a girl from Savannah aims for the FBI and trains to talk people off ledges, for instance, then circles back to the local police. Did you play cops with your Barbies?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t much like Barbies, really. All that blond hair, those big breasts.\"\n \"Which is why I loved them.\" He laughed when she only blinked at him. \"What? You figure Malibu Barbie isn\u0027t going to start a ten-yearold boy thinking?\"\n \"I do now. Unfortunately.\"\n \"So if it wasn\u0027t Barbies, what started you on the road? G.I. Joe?\"\n \"Joe\u0027s a soldier. It was Dave McVee.\"\n \"Dave McVee? I must\u0027ve missed him during my action-figure stage.\"\n \"He\u0027s a person and, though he\u0027s a hero, has never been a toy-that I\u0027m aware of.\"\n \"Ah.\" He refilled their glasses and enjoyed the way the lights played over that porcelain skin, those clever cat\u0027s eyes. \"High-school crush? First love?\"\n \"Neither. Hero, first and last. He saved us.\"\n When she said nothing more, Duncan shook his head. \"You know you can\u0027t leave it there.\"\n \"No, I suppose I can\u0027t. My father was killed when my mother was pregnant with Carter. My younger brother.\"\n \"That\u0027s rough.\" He laid his hand over hers. \"Seriously rough. How old were you?\"\n \"Four, nearly five. I remember him, a little. But I remember more it broke something in Mama that took a long time to heal, and it never healed all the way. I know now, being a trained observer who\u0027s educated in psychology, that his death likely laid the groundwork for her agoraphobia. She had to go out to work, had to haul us around. No choice at all. But for years she kept mostly to herself.\"\n \"She had a choice,\" Duncan disagreed. \"She chose to do what needed to be done to take care of her family.\"\n \"Yes, you\u0027re right. And she did take care. Then she met this man.\n She met Reuben. He\u0027d come by, fix things for her. Little household things. I could see, being a girl of almost twelve, the flirt was on between them. It was odd, but my father\u0027d been gone a long time, and it was nice, too, to see her get all flushed and foolish.\"\n \"You wanted her to be happy.\"\n \"I did. He was nice to us, at first Reuben was awful nice to us. Playing catch with Carter out in the yard, bringing us candy, taking Mama out to the movies and such.\"\n \"But he didn\u0027t stay nice. I can hear it,\" Duncan said when she looked at him. \"I can hear it in your voice.\"\n \"No, he didn\u0027t stay nice. They\u0027d slept together. I\u0027m not sure how I knew it, even then. But she opened herself up enough, after all those years, to be with him that way.\"\n \"And that\u0027s when it changed?\"\n \"Yeah. He got possessive, proprietary, critical. He\u0027d pick on us, all three of us really, but make it like a joke. Carter, especially Carter got the digs. Boy couldn\u0027t find his ass with both hands, ha ha ha. A man never grew balls reading books. And so on. He started coming over every night, expecting Mama to have dinner hot on the table, shoo us off so he could grope her. She wouldn\u0027t, and he\u0027d get pissy. Started drinking a lot. I expect he always did, but he drank more at the house than he had at first.\n \"And this is terrible dinner conversation.\"\n \"I\u0027d like to hear the rest. My father drank more than his share, so I know what it\u0027s like. Finish it off.\"\n \"All right. One day he came by when Mama was still at work. It was just Carter and me. He\u0027d been drinking, and he popped open another beer, then a second one and pushed it at Carter. Told him it was time he learned to drink like a man. Carter didn\u0027t want it. God, he was only seven. Carter told him to go away, leave him alone, and Reuben smacked him, right in the face, for sass. Well, I sassed him then, you can believe it.\"\n The old rage bubbled straight up. \"I told him to get the hell out of our house, to keep his fat hands off my brother. Well, he smacked me, too. And that\u0027s when Mama came in. I\u0027ll tell you something, Duncan, up to that point I loved her. She worked so hard, she did her best. But\n I never thought she had any backbone. Not until she walked in and saw me and Carter on the floor and that son of a bitch standing over us taking off his belt.\"\n She paused a moment, took a sip of wine. \"He was going to use it on us, going to teach us a lesson. Mama lit into him like ball lightning. Of course, he was twice her size, and drunk, so he knocked her clear across the room. She was screaming at him to get out, to stay away from her babies, and I told Carter to run, to run to the neighbor\u0027s, call the police.\n When I was sure he\u0027d gotten far enough away, I started screaming, too, saying the police were coming. Reuben called me and Mama names I wasn\u0027t yet acquainted with, but he went.\"\n \"You kept your head.\" His hand gripped hers on the table now, a solid link. \"You were smart.\"\n \"I was scared. I wanted the police because the police are supposed to help. They came, and they talked to my mother. I don\u0027t want to say they talked her out of filing charges, but they didn\u0027t encourage it. They took his name, said they\u0027d go talk to him. They probably did. I don\u0027t know all that happened, just some. I know he went by her work, apologized to her. I know he came by the house with flowers, but she wouldn\u0027t let him in. I\u0027d see him sitting outside in his car, just sitting there watching the house. And once, at least once that I saw, he grabbed her when she was outside, tried to pull her into his car. I called the police again then, and some of the neighbors came out, so he took off again. And Mama, she took out a restraining order. That\u0027s what they told her she should do.\"\n \"They didn\u0027t arrest him.\"\n \"I think they may have put him in holding for a few hours, and they gave him a stern talking-to. So a few nights later, he got liquored up, got his gun, and he broke into the house. He hit Mama so hard she still has a little scar here.\" Phoebe traced her fingers over her cheek. \"He held the gun to her head, and he told me and Carter to go around, lock all the doors, the windows, close the curtains. We were all going to sit ourselves down, have a long talk.\n \"He kept us in there almost twelve hours. The police came, after a couple hours, I think. Reuben shot a few holes in the wall for sport, and the neighbors called the police. He yelled out he\u0027d kill us all if they tried coming in. The brats first. Pretty soon, the police shut off the power. It was August, it was hot. Then Dave got him on the phone and kept him talking.\"\n \"He talked him into letting you go?\"\n \"He kept him talking. That\u0027s the first rule. As long as Reuben was talking to Dave, he wasn\u0027t killing us. He would have; I could see it. Carter and me. Maybe not Mama because he\u0027d gotten it into his head she belonged to him. But Dave got him talking about fishing. A long conversation about fishing, and kept us alive. But after a while, Reuben got himself worked up again. He was going to hurt Carter, I could feel it. So I distracted him, the way Dave had with the fishing. Between one thing and another, I got into the bathroom, unlocked the window in there, and I told Carter-bullied Carter-into going in first chance, getting out that way.\"\n \"You got your brother out,\" Duncan murmured.\n \"Reuben had a serious hard-on for Carter. He was going to hurt him.\" She told him then about fixing the meal, the sleeping pills. And of sitting in the hospital while they stitched up her mother\u0027s face, talking to Dave.\n \"He kept my family alive.\"\n \"And you got them out. Twelve years old.\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t have had a family to get out if it hadn\u0027t been for Dave.\n We moved into Cousin Bess\u0027s house after that, the house on Jones Street. Dave kept in touch. Lots of longer stories in all of that, but Dave talked to me about hostage and crisis negotiation. He thought I\u0027d have a knack for it, and the perspective of what it\u0027s like on the other side. I wanted to please him, and it sounded exciting. So I trained, and I found out he was right. I have a knack for it.\"\n She lifted her glass, half toast. \"It\u0027s no lottery ticket, but it put me where I am.\"\n \"What happened to Reuben?\"\n \"He died in prison. Pissed someone off enough for that someone to shove a shiv into him multiple times. As a moral woman, as an officer of the law, I\u0027m obliged to deplore that sort of thing. I went out and bought a bottle of champagne, not quite up to these standards, but a very decent bottle. I enjoyed every drop of it.\"\n \"Glad to hear it.\" He gave her hand a quick squeeze. \"You\u0027ve had an interesting life, Phoebe.\"\n \"Interesting?\"\n \"Well, you can\u0027t claim to have lived in the rut of routine.\" She laughed. \"No, I don\u0027t suppose I can.\"\n \"I\u0027ve got some insight now on why I saw that purpose in you when you walked into Suicide Joe\u0027s apartment. And you have the sexiest green eyes.\"\n She watched him with them as she sipped her champagne. \"If you think because I\u0027ve bared my soul, more or less, and have had several glasses of this lovely champagne, I\u0027m going to slide down into the cabin and have wild sex with you, you\u0027re mistaken.\"\n \"Can we negotiate? Any other kind of sex a possibility?\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so, but thanks all the same.\"\n \"How about a walk along the river where I can kiss you in the moonlight?\"\n \"We can start with the walk.\"\n He rose, took her hand. And as she came to her feet, he simply cupped the back of her neck to draw her mouth to his.\n Warm lips and cool air, a hard body and a gentle touch. She gave in, gave up to the moment. Her fingers twined with his and curled tight as she leaned in for more.\n He could feel the strength of her under the soft, soft skin. It was that, he knew, that had pulled at him from the first moment. Those contrasts, those complexities. There was nothing simple, nothing ordinary about her.\n Yet he thought this could be simple-this one thing-this slowly building heat between them.\n So the long, long kiss spun out, hinting of a spark that might flash at any moment, while the deck swayed gently under their feet, and the air blew soft over the water.\n She brought her hand to his chest, kept it there a moment as his heart thumped beneath her palm. Then she used it to ease him back. \"Someone else has quite a knack,\" she commented.\n \"I\u0027ve been practicing religiously since I was twelve.\" He brought the hand on his chest up, to rub his lips over the knuckles. \"I\u0027ve developed a few variations, if you\u0027d like me to demonstrate.\"\n \"I think that was enough of a demonstration for right now. We discussed a walk.\"\n \"Probably best to save the variations. I\u0027m not sure you\u0027re ready.\"\n \"Oh really? Don\u0027t think you can use that kind of maneuver on me. I\u0027m a cop.\"\n He stepped off, onto the pier, held out a hand for hers. \"Variation Seven\u0027s been known to cause temporary unconsciousness.\"\n \"That\u0027s a straight dare.\" She stepped from boat to dock. \"And I haven\u0027t taken a dare since I was seven. We\u0027re walking, Mr. Swift.\"\n \"Can\u0027t blame a guy for trying.\"\n As they walked, she angled her head to study his face. \"Variation Seven?\"\n \"I\u0027m required by law to give the previous warning before use. Now that you\u0027ve been warned, I\u0027m in the clear.\"\n \"I\u0027ll keep that in mind.\"\n Her laugh floated over the water. And her face, bright with it, filled the field glasses.\n He dug into the takeout bag for his fries as he watched her, watched them. And he considered how quick and easy it would be if he had that face of hers in the crosshairs of a rifle scope.\n Bang!\n Too quick, too easy.\n But before much longer, she wouldn\u0027t be laughing. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/high-noon/page-6.html","bookId":2412,"book":{"id":2412,"title":"High Noon","description":"Storyline: \n Police Lieutenant Phoebe MacNamara found her calling at an early age when an unstable man broke into her family\u0027s home, trapping and terrorizing them for hours.
