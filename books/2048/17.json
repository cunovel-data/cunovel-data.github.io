{"id":109922,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"49 The Bedside Manner of Cannibals Tuck slept through most of the day, then woke up with a pot of coffee over a spy novel. He looked at the words and his eyes moved down the pages for half an hour, but when he put it down he had no idea what he had read. His mind was torn by the thought of Beth Curtis showing up at his door. Whenever a guard crunched across the gravel compound, Tuck would go to the window to see if it was her. She wouldn\u0027t come here during the day, would she? He had promised Kimi that he would check on Sepie and meet him at the drinking circle, but now he was already a day late on the promise. What would happen if Beth Curtis came to his bungalow while he was out? She couldn\u0027t tell the doc, could she? What would her excuse be for coming here? Still, Tuck was beginning to think that the doc wasn\u0027t really the one running the show. He was merely skilled labor, and so, probably, was Tucker himself. Tuck looked at the pages of the spy novel, watched a little Malaysian television (today they were throwing spears at coconuts on top of a pole while the Asian stock market\u0027s tickers scrolled at the bottom of the screen in thin-colored bands), and waited for nightfall. When he could no longer see the guard\u0027s face across the compound, he made a great show of yawning and stretching in front of the window, then turned out the lights, built the dummy in his bed, and slipped out through the bottom of the shower. He took his usual path behind the clinic, then inched his way up on the far side and peeked around the front. Not ten feet away a guard stood by the door. He ducked quickly around the corner. There was no way into the clinic tonight. He could wait or even try to intimidate the guard, now that he knew they were afraid to shoot him. Of course, he wasn\u0027t sure they knew they were afraid to shoot him. What if Mato was the only one? He slid back down the side of the building and through the coconut grove to the beach. The swim had become like walking to the mailbox, and he was past the minefield in less than five minutes. As he rounded the curve of the beach, he saw a light and figures moving around it. The Shark men had brought a kerosene lamp to the drinking circle. How civilized. Some of the men acknowledged his presence as he moved into the circle, but the old chief only stared into the sand between his feet. There was a stack of magazines at his side. \"What\u0027s going on, guys?\" A panic made its way around the circle to land on Abo, who looked up and said, \"Your friend is shot by the guards.\" Tuck waited, but Abo looked away. Tuck jumped in front of Malink. \"Chief, is he telling the truth? Did they shoot Kimi? Is he dead?\" \"Not dead,\" Malink said, shaking his head. \"Hurt very bad.\" \"Take me to him.\" \"He is at Sarapul\u0027s house.\" \"Right. I\u0027ll look it up in the guidebook later. Now take me to him.\" Old Malink shook his head. \"He going to die.\" \"Where is he shot?\" \"In the water by the minefield.\" \"No, numbnuts. Where on his body?\" Malink held his hand to his side. \"I say, \u0027Take him to the Sorcerer,\u0027 but Sarapul say, \u0027The Sorcerer shoot him.\u0027\" Malink then looked Tuck in the eye for the first time. His big brown face was a study in trouble. \"Vincent send you. What do I do?\" Tuck could sense a profound embarrassment in the old man. He had just admitted in front of the men in his tribe that he didn\u0027t have a clue. The loss of face was gnawing at him like a hungry sand crab. Tuck said, \"Vincent is pleased with your decision, Malink. Now I must see Kimi.\" One of the young Vincents stood up. Feeling very brave, he said, \"I will take you.\" Tuck grabbed his shoulder. \"You\u0027re a good man. Lead on.\" The young Vincent seemed to forget to breathe for a moment, as if Tuck had touched him on the shoulders with a sword and welcomed him to a seat at the Round Table, then he came to his senses and took off into the jungle. Tuck followed close behind, nearly clotheslining himself a couple of times on branches that the young Vincent ran right under. The coral gravel on the path tore at Tuck\u0027s feet as he ran. When they emerged from the jungle, Tuck could see a light coming out of Sarapul\u0027s hut, which Tuck recognized from his day in the cannibal tree. He turned to young Vincent, who was terrified. He had charged the dragon, but had made the mistake of stopping to think about it. \"Kimi\u0027s with the cannibal?\" Young Vincent nodded rapidly while bouncing from foot to foot, looking like he would wet himself any second. \"Go on,\" Tuck said. \"Go tell Malink to come here. And have a drink. You\u0027re wigging out.\" Vincent nodded and ran off. Tuck approached the door slowly, creeping up until he could see the old man crouched over Kimi, trying to pour something into his mouth from a coconut cup. \"Hey,\" Tuck said, \"how\u0027s he doing?\" Sarapul looked around and gestured for Tuck to enter the house. Tuck had to bend to get through the low door, but once inside the ceiling opened to a fifteen-foot peak. Tuck knelt by Kimi. The navigator\u0027s eyes were closed, and even in the orange light of Sarapul\u0027s oil lamp, he looked pale. He was uncovered and a bandage was wrapped around his middle. \"Did you do this?\" Tuck asked Sarapul. The old cannibal nodded. \"They shoot him in water. I pull him in.\" \"How many times?\" Sarapu held up a long bent finger. \"Both sides? Did it go through?\" Tuck gestured with his fingers on either side of his hip. \"Yes,\" Sarapul said. \"Let me see.\" The old cannibal nodded and unwrapped Kimi\u0027s bandage. Tuck rolled the navigator gently on his side. Kimi groaned, but didn\u0027t wake. The bullet had hit him about two inches above the hip and about an inch in. It had passed right though, going in the size of a pencil and exiting the size of a quarter. Tuck was amazed that he hadn\u0027t bled to death. The old cannibal had done a good job. \"Don\u0027t take him to the Sorcerer,\" Sarapul said. \"The Sorcerer will kill him. He is the only navigator.\" The old cannibal was pleading while trying to remain fierce. A sob betrayed him. \"He is my friend.\" Tuck studied the wound to give the old cannibal a chance to gather himself. He couldn\u0027t remember any vital organs being in that area. But the wounds would have to be stiched shut. Tuck wasn\u0027t sure he had the stomach for it, but Sarapul was right. He couldn\u0027t take Kimi to Curtis. \"Do you guys have anything you use to kill pain?\" The cannibal looked at him quizzically. Tuck pinched him and he yelped. \"Pain. Do you have anything to stop pain?\" \"Yes. Don\u0027t do that anymore.\" \"No, for Kimi.\" Sarapul nodded and went out into the dark. He returned a few seconds later with a glass jug half-full of milky liquid. He handed it to Tuck. \"Kava,\" he said. \"It make you no ouch.\" Tuck uncapped the bottle and a smell like cooking cabbage assaulted his nostrils. He held his breath and took a big slug of the stuff, suppressed a gag, and swallowed. His mouth was immediately numb. \"Wow, this ought to do it. I need a needle and some thread and some hot water. And some alcohol or peroxide if you have it.\" Sarapul nodded. \"I put Neosporin on him.\" \"You know about that? Why am I doing this?\" Sarapul shrugged and left the house. Evidently, he didn\u0027t keep anything inside but his skinny old ass. Kimi moaned and Tuck rolled him over. The navigator\u0027s eyes fluttered open. \"Boss, that dog fucker shot me.\" \"Curtis? The older white guy?\" \"No. Japanese dog fucker.\" Kimi drew his finger across his scalp in a line and Tuck knew exactly who he meant. \"What were you doing, Kimi? I told you that I\u0027d check on Sepie and meet you.\" Tuck felt a pleasant numbness moving into his limbs. This kava stuff would definitely do the trick. \"You didn\u0027t come. I worry for her.\" \"I had to fly.\" \"Sarapul say those people very bad. You should come live here, boss.\" \"Be quiet. Drink this.\" He held the jug to Kimi\u0027s lips and tipped it up. The navigator took a sip and Tuck let him rest before administering another dose. \"That stuff nasty,\" Kimi said. \"I\u0027m going to stitch you up.\" The navigator\u0027s eyes went wide. He took the jug from Tuck and gulped from it until Tuck ripped it out of his hands. \"It won\u0027t be that bad.\" \"Not for you.\" Tuck grinned. \"Haven\u0027t you heard? I\u0027ve been sent here by Vincent.\" \"That what Sarapul say. He say he don\u0027t believe in Vincent until we come, but now he do.\" \"Really?\" Sarapul came through the door with an armload of supplies. \"I don\u0027t say that. This dog fucker lies.\" Tuck shook his head. \"You guys were made for each other.\" Sarapul set down a sewing kit and a bottle of peroxide, then crouched over the navigator and looked up at Tuck. \"Can you fix him?\" Tuck grinned and grabbed the old cannibal by the cheek. \"Yum,\" Tuck said. \"Sorry,\" Sarapul said. \"I\u0027ll fix him,\" Tuck said. Silently he asked for help from Vincent. \"I can\u0027t feel my arms,\" Kimi said. \"My legs, where are my legs? I\u0027m dying.\" Sarapul looked at Tuck. \"Good,\" he said. \"More kava.\" Tuck picked up the jug, now only a quarter full. \"This is great stuff.\" \"I\u0027m dying,\" Kimi said. Tuck rolled the navigator over on his side. \"Kimi, did I tell you I saw Roberto?\" \"See, I didn\u0027t eat him,\" Sarapul said. \"Where?\" Kimi asked. \"He came to my house. He talked to me.\" \"You lie. He only speak Filipino.\" \"He learned English. Can you feel that?\" \"Feel what? I am dying?\" \"Good,\" Tuck said and he laid his first stitch. \"What Roberto say? He mad at me?\" \"No, he said you\u0027re dying.\" \"I\u0027m dying, I\u0027m dying,\" Kimi wailed. \"Just kidding. He didn\u0027t say that. He said you\u0027re probably dying.\" Tuck kept Kimi talking, and before long the navigator was so convinced of his approaching death he didn\u0027t notice that Tucker Case, self-taught incompetent, had completely stitched and dressed his wounds. 50 Don Quixote at the Miniature Golf Course He was sleeping, dreaming of flying, but not in a plane. He was soaring over the warm Pacific above a pod of hump-back whales. He swooped in close to the waves and one of the whales breached, winked at him with a football-sized eye, and said, \"You da man.\" Then the whale smiled and blew the dream all to hell, for while Tuck knew himself to indeed \"be da man\" and while he didn\u0027t mind being told so, he also knew that whales couldn\u0027t smile and that bit of illogic above all the others broke the dream\u0027s back. He woke up. There was music playing in his bungalow. \"Dance with me, Tucker,\" she said. \"Dance with me in the moonlight.\" The smooth muted horns of \"Moonlight Serenade\" filled the room from a portable boom box on his coffee table. Beth Curtis, wearing a sequined evening gown and high-heeled sandals, danced an imaginary partner around the room. \"Oh, dance with me, Tucker. Please.\" She glided over to the bed and held her hand out to him. He gave her the coconut man\u0027s head, rolled over, and ducked under the sheet. \"Go away. I\u0027m tired and you\u0027re insane.\" She sat on the bed with a bounce. \"You old stick in the mud.\" A pouty voice now. \"You never want to have any romance.\" Tuck feigned sleep. Pretty well, he thought. \"I brought champagne and candles. And I made cookies.\" This is me sleeping, Tuck thought. This is exactly how I behave when I sleep. \"I twisted up a joint of skunky green bud the size of your dick.\" \"I hope you got help carrying it,\" he said, still under the covers. \"I rolled it on the inside of my thigh the way the women in Cuba roll cigars.\" \"Don\u0027t tell me how you licked the paper.\" She slapped him on the bottom. \"Come on, dance with me.\" He rolled over and pulled the sheet off his face. \"You\u0027re not going to go away, are you?\" \"Not until you dance with me and have some champagne.\" Tuck looked at his watch. \"It\u0027s five in the morning.\" \"Haven\u0027t you ever danced till dawn?\" \"Not vertically.\" \"Oh, you nasty boy.\" Coy now, as if anything short of being caught at genocide could make her blush. The song changed to something slow and oily that Tuck didn\u0027t recognize. \"This is such a good song. Let\u0027s dance.\" She swooned. She actually swooned. Swooning, Tuck noticed, looked very much like an asthma attack wheezed in slow motion. A rooster crowed, and seven thousand six hundred and fifty-two roosters responded in turn. \"Beth, it\u0027s morning. Please go home.\" \"Then you\u0027re not going to dance with me?\" \"No.\" \"All right, I guess we\u0027ll skip the dancing, but I want you to know that I\u0027m very disappointed.\" She stood up, pulled the evening gown over her head, and dropped it to the floor. The sequins sizzled against the floor like a dying rattlesnake. She wore only stockings underneath. Tuck said, \"I don\u0027t think this is such a good idea,\" but there was no conviction in his voice and she pushed him back on the bed. Tuck was staring up at the ceiling, his arm pinned under her neck, silently mouthing his mantra, \"After this, I will not bone the crazy woman. After this, I will not bone the crazy woman. After...\" Boy, how many times had he said that? Maybe things were getting better, though. In the past it had always been \"I will not get drunk and bone the crazy woman.\" He had been only sleepy this time. He tried to worm his arm out from under her, then used the \"old snuggle method.\" He rolled into her for a hug and when she responded with a sleepy moan and tried to kiss him, the space under her neck opened up and he was free. It worked as well on murdering bitch goddesses as it did on Mary Jean ladies. Better even, Beth didn\u0027t wear near as much hair spray, which can slow a guy down. God, I\u0027m good. He rolled out of bed and crept into the bathroom. While he peed, he softly chanted, \"Yo, after this, I will not bone the crazy woman.\" It had taken on a rap cadence and he was feeling very hip along with the usual self-loathing. His scars made him think of Kimi\u0027s wound, and suddenly he was angry. He padded naked back to the bed and jostled the sleeping icon. \"Get up, Beth. Go home.\" And someone pounded on the door. \"Mr. Case, tee time in five.\" Tuck clamped his hand over Beth\u0027s mouth, lifted her by her head in a single sweeping move from the bed to the bathroom, where he released her and shut the door. Fred Astaire, had he been a terrorist, would have been proud of the move. Tuck grabbed his pants off the floor, which is where he kept them, pulled them on, and answered the door. Sebastian Curtis had a driver slung over his shoulder. \"You might want to put on a shirt, Mr. Case. You can get burned, even this early.\" \"Right,\" Tuck said. He was looking at the caddie. Today Stripe carried the clubs. The guard sneered at him. Tuck smiled back. Stripe, like Mato before him, was doing caddie duty unarmed. Time to play a little round for the navigator, he thought. He winked at Stripe. \"I\u0027ll be right there.\" Tuck closed the door and went to the bathroom to tell Beth to wait until he\u0027d gone before coming out, but when he opened the door, she was gone. \"Did you know that over ninety percent of all the endangered species are on islands?\" the doctor said. \"Nope,\" Tuck said. He picked his ball up and put it on the rubberized mat, then turned to Stripe. \"Dopey, give me a five iron.\" They were on the fourth hole and had crisscrossed the compound pretending to play golf for an hour. Tuck swung and skidded the ball fifty yards across the gravel. \"Heads up, Bashful,\" Tuck said as he threw the club back to Stripe. \"Islands are like evolutionary pressure cookers. New species pop up faster and go extinct more quickly. It works the same way with religions.\" \"No kidding, Doc?\" They still had fifty yards to get to where Sebastian\u0027s first shot lay. Tuck had hit three times. \"The cargo cults have all the same events associated with the great reli-gions: a period of oppression, the rise of a Messiah, a new order, the promise of an endless time of peace and prosperity. But instead of devel-oping over centuries like Christianity or Buddhism, it happens in just a few years. It\u0027s fascinating, like being able to see the hands of the clock move right before your eyes and be a part of it.\" \"So you must totally get off when daylight savings time comes around.\" \"It was just a metaphor, Mr. Case.\" \"Call me Tuck.\" They had reached Tuck\u0027s ball and he placed it on the Astro Turf mat. \"Sneezy, give me the driver.\" Sebastian cleared his throat. \"That looks more like a nine iron to me. You\u0027ve only got fifty yards to the pin.\" \"Trust me, Doc. I need a driver for this one.\" Stripe snickered and handed him the driver. Tuck examined it, one of the large-headed alloy models that had become so popular in the States - all metal. Tuck grinned at Stripe. \"So, Doc, I guess you shitcanned the Meth-odist thing to watch the clock spin.\" Tuck lined up the shot and took a practice swing. The club whooshed through the air. \"Have you ever had faith in anything, Mr. Case?\" Tuck took another practice swing. \"Me? Faith? Nope.\" \"Not even your own abilities?\" \"Nope.\" Tuck made a show of lining up the shot again and making sure his hips were loose. \"Then you shouldn\u0027t make jokes about it.\" \"Right,\" Tuck said. He tensed and put his entire weight behind the club, but instead of hitting the ball, he swung it around like a baseball bat, slamming the head into Stripe\u0027s cheek, shattering the bone with a sickening thwack. The guard\u0027s feet went out from under him and he landed with a crunch in the coral. \"Christ!\" Sebastian yelled. He grabbed the club and wrenched it from Tuck\u0027s grasp. \"What in the hell are you doing?\" Tuck didn\u0027t answer. He bent over the guard until he was only inches from his face and whispered, \"Fore, motherfucker.\" A second later Tuck heard a mechanical click and the guard who had been tending the pin had an Uzi pressed to his ear. Sebastian Curtis was bent over Stripe, pulling his eyes open to see if his pupils would contract. \"Take Mr. Case to his bungalow and stay with him. Send two men with a stretcher and find Beth. Tell her to - \" Curtis suddenly realized that the guard was only getting about a third of what he said. \"Bring my wife.\" \"I\u0027ll get back to you on that faith thing, Doc,\" Tuck said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/island-of-the-sequined-love-nun/page-17.html","bookId":2048,"book":{"id":2048,"title":"Island of the Sequined Love Nun","description":"Storyline: Pilot Tucker Case has a weakness--well, Tuck really has two--and the combination of drinking and sex in the cockpit of the pink Mary Jean Cosmetics Learjet puts him on the front page of papers all over the planet.
