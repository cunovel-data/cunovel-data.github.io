The jet and job are on Alualu, a speck in the Pacific Ocean, and Tucker has nowhere else to go. But first he has to get to Alualu, and once there, he faces a hurricane, Shark People, atypical missionaries, and boredom ... and the responsibilities assigned to him by Capt. Vincent Bennidetti, U.S. Air Force, deceased bomber pilot and present-day deity of the Shark People. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/island-of-the-sequined-love-nun.jpg","author":"Christopher Moore","type":"Humorous","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":22,"category":{"id":13,"name":"Humorous","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
