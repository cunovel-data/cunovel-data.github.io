{"id":109913,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"4\\n\\n Pinnacle of the Pink Pyramid\\n\\n A low buzz of anticipation ran through the halls of the hospital. Reporters checked the batteries in their microrecorders and cell phones. Orderlies and nurses lingered in the hallways in hope of getting a glimpse of the celebrity. The FAA men straightened their ties and shot their cuffs. One receptionist in administration, who was only two distributorships away from earning her own pink Oldsmobile, ducked into an examining room and sucked lungfuls of oxygen to chase the dizziness that comes from meeting one\u0027s Messiah. Mary Jean was coming.\\n\\n Mary Jean Dobbins did not travel with an entourage, bodyguards, or any other of the decorative leeches commonly attached to the power-wielding rich.\\n\\n \"God is my bodyguard,\" Mary Jean would say.\\n\\n She carried a .38-caliber gold-plated Lady Smith automatic in her bag: the Clara Barton Commemorative Model, presented to her by the Daughters of the Confederacy at their annual \"Let\u0027s Lynch Leroy\" pecan pie bake-off, held every Martin Luther King Jr. Day. (She didn\u0027t agree with their politics, but the belles could sure sell some makeup. If the South did not rise again, it wouldn\u0027t be for lack of foundation.)\\n\\n Today, as Mary Jean came through the doors of the main lobby, she was flanked by a tall predatory woman in a black business suit - a severe con-trast to Mary Jean\u0027s soft pastel blue ensemble with matching bag and pumps. \"Strength and femininity are not exclusive, ladies.\" She was sixty-five; matronly but elegant. Her makeup was perfect, but not overdone. She wore a sapphire-and-diamond pin whose value approximated the gross national product of Zaire.\\n\\n She greeted every orderly and nurse with a smile, asked after their families, thanked them for their compassionate work, flirted when appropriate, and tossed compliments over her shoulder as she passed, without ever missing a step. She left a wake of acutely charmed fans, even among the cynical and stubborn.\\n\\n Outside Tucker\u0027s room the predatory woman - a lawyer - broke formation and confronted the maggotry of reporters, allowing Mary Jean to slip past.\\n\\n She poked her head inside. \"You awake, slugger?\"\\n\\n Tuck was startled by her voice, yanked out of his redundant reverie of unemployment, imprisonment, and impotence. He wanted to pull the sheets over his head and quietly die.\\n\\n \"Mary Jean.\"\\n\\n The makeup magnate moved to his bedside and took his hand, all compassion and caring. \"How are you feeling?\"\\n\\n Tucker looked away from her. \"I\u0027m okay.\"\\n\\n \"Do you need anything? I\u0027ll have it here in a Texas jiffy.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine,\" Tucker said. She always made him feel like he\u0027d just struck out in his first Little League game and she was consoling him with milk and cookies. The fact that he\u0027d once tried to seduce her doubled the humi-liation. \"Jake told me that you\u0027re having me moved to Houston. Thank you.\"\\n\\n \"I have to keep an eye on you, don\u0027t I?\" She patted his hand. \"You sure you\u0027re feeling well enough for a talk?\"\\n\\n Tucker nodded. He wasn\u0027t buying the outpouring of warm fuzzies she was selling. He\u0027d seen her doing business on the plane.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good, honey,\" Mary Jean said, rising and looking around the room for the first time. \"I\u0027ll have some flowers sent up. A touch of color will brighten things up, won\u0027t it? Something fragrant too. The constant smell of disinfectant must be disturbing.\"\\n\\n \"A little,\" Tuck said.\\n\\n She wheeled on her heel and looked at him. Her smile went hard. Tuck saw wrinkles around her mouth for the first time. \"Probably reminds you of what a total fuckup you are, doesn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n Tucker gulped. She\u0027d faked him out of his shoes. \"I\u0027m sorry, Mary Jean. I\u0027m...\"\\n\\n She raised a hand and he shut up. \"You know I don\u0027t like to use profanity or firearms, so please don\u0027t push me, Tucker. A lady controls her anger.\"\\n\\n \"Firearms?\"\\n\\n Mary Jean pulled the Lady Smith automatic out of her purse and leveled it at Tucker\u0027s bandaged crotch. Strangely, he noticed that Mary Jean had chipped a nail drawing the gun and for that, he realized, she really might kill him.\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t listen to me when I told you to stop drinking. You didn\u0027t listen when I told you to stay away from my representatives. You didn\u0027t listen when I told you that if you were going to amount to anything, you had to give your life to God. You\u0027d better damn well listen now.\" She racked the slide on the automatic. \"Are you listening?\"\\n\\n Tuck nodded. He didn\u0027t breathe, but he nodded.\\n\\n \"Good. I have run this company for forty years without a hint of scandal until now. I woke up yesterday to see my face next to yours on all the morning news shows. Today it\u0027s on the cover of every newspaper and tabloid in the country. A bad picture, Tucker. My suit was out of season. And every article uses the words \u0027penis\u0027 and \u0027prostitute\u0027 over and over. I can\u0027t have that. I\u0027ve worked too hard for that.\"\\n\\n She reached out and tugged on his catheter. Pain shot though his body and he reached for the ringer for the nurse.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t even think about it, pretty boy. I just wanted to make sure I had your attention.\"\\n\\n \"The gun pretty much did it, Mary Jean,\" Tucker groaned. Fuck it, he was a dead man anyway.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you speak to me. Just listen. This is going to disappear. You are going to disappear. You\u0027re getting out of here tomorrow and then you\u0027re going to a cabin I have up in the Rockies. You won\u0027t go home, you won\u0027t speak to any reporters, you won\u0027t say doodly squat. My lawyers will handle the legal aspects and keep you out of jail, but you will never surface again. When this blows over, you can go on with your pathetic life. But with a new name. And if you ever set foot in the state of Texas or come within a hundred yards of anyone involved in my company, I will personally shoot you dead. Do you understand?\"\\n\\n \"Can I still fly?\"\\n\\n Mary Jean laughed and lowered the gun. \"Sweetie, to a Texas way a thinkin\u0027 the only way you coulda screwed up worse is if you\u0027d throwed a kid down a well after fessing up to being on the grassy knoll stompin\u0027 yellow roses in between shootin\u0027 the President. You ain\u0027t gonna fly, drive, walk, crawl, or spit if I have anything to say about it.\" She put the gun in her purse and went into the tiny bathroom to check her makeup. A quick primping and she headed for\\n\\n the door. \"I\u0027ll send up some flowers. Y\u0027all heal up now, honey.\"\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t going to kill him after all. Maybe he could win her back. \"Mary Jean, I think I had a spiritual experience.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to hear about any of your degenerate activities.\"\\n\\n \"No, a real spiritual experience. Like a - what do you call it? - an epiphany?\"\\n\\n \"Son, you don\u0027t know it, but you\u0027re as close to seeing the Lord as you\u0027ve ever been in your life. Now you hush before I send you to perdition.\"\\n\\n She put on her best beatific smile and left the room radiating the power of positive thinking.\\n\\n Tucker pulled the covers over his head and reached for the flask Jake had left. Perdition, huh? She made it sound bad. Must be in Oklahoma.\\n\\n 5\\n\\n Our Lady of the Fishnet Stockings\\n\\n The High Priestess of the Shark People ate Chee-tos and watched afternoon talk shows over the satellite feed. She sat in a wicker emperor\u0027s chair. A red patent leather pump dangled from one toe. Red lipstick, red nails, a big red bow in her hair. But for a pair of silk seamed stockings, she was naked.\\n\\n On the screen: Meadow Malackovitch, in a neck brace, sobbed on her lawyer\u0027s shoulder - a snapshot of the pilot who had traumatized her was inset in the upper-right-hand corner. The host, a failed weatherman who now made seven figures mining trailer parks for atrocities, was reading the dubious r��sum�� of Tucker Case. Shots of the pink jet, before and after. Stock footage of Mary Jean on an airfield tarmac, followed by Case in a leather jacket.\\n\\n The High Priestess touched herself lightly, leaving a faint orange stripe of Chee-to spoor on her pubes (she was a natural blonde), then keyed the intercom that connected her to the Sorcerer.\\n\\n \"What?\" came the man\u0027s voice, weary but awake. It was 2:00 A.M. The Sorcerer had been working all night.\\n\\n \"I think we\u0027ve found our pilot,\" she said.\\n\\n 6\\n\\n Who\u0027s Flying This Life?\\n\\n At the last minute Mary Jean changed her mind about sending Tucker Case to her cabin in the mountains. \"Put him in a motel room outside of town and don\u0027t let him out until I say so.\"\\n\\n In two weeks Tucker had seen only the nurse who came in to change his bandages and the guard. Actually, the guard was a tackle, second-string defense from SMU, six-foot-six, two hundred and seventy pounds of earnest Christian na\u0026iuml;vet�� named Dusty Lemon.\\n\\n Tucker was lying on the bed watching television. Dusty sat hunched over the wood-grain Formica table reading Scripture.\\n\\n Tucker said, \"Dusty, why don\u0027t you go get us a six-pack and a pizza?\"\\n\\n Dusty didn\u0027t look up. Tuck could see the shine of his scalp through his crew cut. A thick Texas drawl: \"No, sir. I don\u0027t drink and Mrs. Jean said that you wasn\u0027t to have no alcohol.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not Mrs. Jean, you doofus. It\u0027s Mrs. Dobbins.\" After two weeks, Dusty was beginning to get on Tuck\u0027s nerves.\\n\\n \"Just the same,\" Dusty said. \"I can call for a pizza for you, but no beer.\"\\n\\n Tuck detected a blush though the crew cut. \"Dusty?\"\\n\\n \"Yes sir.\" The tackle looked up from his Bible, waited.\\n\\n \"Get a real name.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir,\" Dusty said, a giant grin bisecting his moon face, \"Tuck.\"\\n\\n Tucker wanted to leap off the bed and cuff Dusty with his Bible, but he was a long way from being able to leap anywhere. Instead, he looked at the ceiling for a second (it was highway safety orange, like the walls, the doors, the tile in the bathroom), then propped\\n\\n himself up on one elbow and considered Dusty\u0027s Bible. \"The red type. That\\n\\n the hot parts?\"\\n\\n \"The words of Jesus,\" Dusty said, not looking up.\\n\\n \"Really?\"\\n\\n Dusty nodded, looked up. \"Would you like me to read to you? When my grandma was in the hospital, she liked me to read Scriptures to her.\"\\n\\n Tucker fell back with an exasperated sigh. He didn\u0027t understand religion. It was like heroin or golf: He knew a lot of people did it, but he didn\u0027t un-derstand why. His father watched sports every Sunday, and his mother had worked in real estate. He grew up thinking that church was something that simply interfered with games and weekend open houses. His first ex-posure to religion, other than the skin mag layouts of the women who had brought down television evangelists, had been his job with Mary Jean. For her it just seemed like good business. Sometimes he would stand in the back of the auditorium and listen to her talk to a thousand women about having God on their sales team, and they would cheer and \"Hallelujah!\" and he would feel as if he\u0027d been left out of something - something beyond the apparent goofiness of it all. Maybe Dusty had something on him besides a hundred pounds.\\n\\n \"Dusty, why don\u0027t you go out tonight? You haven\u0027t been out in two weeks. I have to be here, but you - you must have a whole line of babes crying to get you back, huh? Big football player like you, huh?\"\\n\\n Dusty blushed again, going deep red from the collar of his practice jersey to the top of his head. He folded his hands and looked at them in his lap. \"Well, I\u0027m sorta waitin\u0027 for the right girl to come along. A lot of the girls that go after us football players, you know, they\u0027re kinda loose.\"\\n\\n Tuck raised an eyebrow. \"And?\"\\n\\n Dusty squirmed, his chair creaked under the strain. \"Well, you know, it\u0027s kinda...\"\\n\\n And suddenly, amid the stammering, Tucker got it. The kid was a virgin. He raised his hand to quiet the boy. \"Never mind, Dusty.\" The big tackle slumped in his chair, exhausted and embarrassed.\\n\\n Tuck considered it. He, who understood so much the importance of a healthy sex life, who knew what women needed and how to give it to them, might never be able to do it again, and Dusty Lemon, who probably could produce a woody that women could chin themselves on, wasn\u0027t using it at all. He pondered it. He worked it over\\n\\n from several angles and came very close to having a religious experience, for who but a vicious and vengeful God would allow such injustice in the world? He thought about it. Poor Tucker. Poor Dusty. Poor, poor Tucker.\\n\\n He felt a lump forming in his throat. He wanted to say something that would make the kid feel better. \"How old are you, Dusty?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be twenty-two next March, sir?\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s not so bad. I mean, you might be a late bloomer, you know. Or gay maybe,\" Tuck said cheerfully.\\n\\n Dusty started to contract into the fetal position. \"Sir, I\u0027d rather not talk about it, if you don\u0027t mind,\" he whimpered. There was a knock on the door and he uncurled, alert and ready to move. He looked to Tucker for instructions.\\n\\n \"Well, answer it.\"\\n\\n Dusty lumbered to the door and pulled it open a crack. \"Yes?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m here to see Tucker Case. It\u0027s okay, I work for Mary Jean.\" Tuck recognized Jake Skye\u0027s voice.\\n\\n \"Just a second.\" Dusty turned and looked to Tucker, confused.\\n\\n \"Who knows we\u0027re here, Dusty?\"\\n\\n \"Just us and Mrs. Jean.\"\\n\\n \"Then why don\u0027t you let him in?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\" He opened the door and Jake Skye strode through carrying a grocery bag and a pizza box.\\n\\n \"Greetings.\" He threw the pizza on the bed. \"Pepperoni and mushroom.\" He glanced at Dusty and paused, taking a moment to look the tackle up and down. \"How\u0027d you get this job? Eat your family?\"\\n\\n \"No, sir,\" Dusty said.\\n\\n Jake patted the tackle\u0027s mammoth shoulder. \"Good to be careful, I guess. Momma always said, \u0027Beware of geeks bearing gifts.\u0027 Who are you?\"\\n\\n \"Jake Skye,\" Tuck said, \"meet Dusty Lemon. Dusty, Jake Skye, Mary Jean\u0027s jet mechanic. Be nice to Dusty, Jake, He\u0027s a virgin.\"\\n\\n Dusty shot a vicious glare at Tuck and extended a boxing glove size mitt. Jake shook his hand. \"Virgin, huh?\"\\n\\n Jake dropped his hand. \"Not including farm animals, though, right?\"\\n\\n Dusty winced and moved to close the door. \"You-all can\u0027t stay long. Mr. Case isn\u0027t supposed to see no one.\"\\n\\n Jake put the grocery bag down on the table, pulled out a fourinch-thick bundle of mail, and tossed it on the bed next to Tucker. \"Your\\n\\n fan mail.\"\\n\\n Tucker picked it up. \"It\u0027s all been opened.\"\\n\\n \"I was bored,\" Jake said, opening the pizza box and extracting a slice. \"A lot of death threats, a few marriage proposals, a couple really interesting ones had both. Oh, and an airline ticket to someplace I\u0027ve never heard of with a check for expenses.\"\\n\\n \"From Mary Jean?\"\\n\\n \"Nope. Some missionary doctor in the Pacific. He wants you to fly for him. Medical supplies or something. Came FedEx yesterday. Almost took the job myself, seeing as I still have my pilot\u0027s license and you don\u0027t, but then, I can get a job here.\"\\n\\n Tucker shuffled through the stack of mail until he found the check and the airline ticket. He unfolded the attached letter.\\n\\n Jake held the pizza box out to the bodyguard. \"Dopey, you want some pizza?\"\\n\\n \"Dusty,\" Dusty corrected.\\n\\n \"Whatever.\" To Tuck: \"He wants you to leave ASAP.\"\\n\\n \"He can\u0027t go anywhere,\" said Dusty.\\n\\n Jake retracted the box. \"I can see that, Dingy. He\u0027s still wired for sound.\" Jake gestured toward the catheter that snaked out of Tucker\u0027s pajama bottoms. \"How long before you can travel?\"\\n\\n Tucker was studying the letter. It certainly seemed legitimate. The doctor was on a remote island north of New Guinea, and he needed someone to fly jet loads of medical supplies to the natives. He specifically mentioned that \"he was not concerned\" about Tucker\u0027s lack of a pilot\u0027s license. The \"need was dire\" and the need was for an experienced jet pilot who could fly a Lear 45.\\n\\n \"Well,\" Jake said, \"when can you roll?\"\\n\\n \"Doctor says not for a week or so,\" Tucker said. \"I don\u0027t get it. This guy is offering more money than I make for Mary Jean. Why me?\"\\n\\n Jake pulled a Lone Star from the grocery bag and twisted off the cap. Tuck zeroed in on the beer. Dusty snatched it out of Jake\u0027s hand.\\n\\n \"The question is,\" Jake said, glaring at Dusty, \"what the fuck is a missionary doctor in Bongo Bongo land doing with a Lear 45?\"\\n\\n \"God\u0027s work?\" Dusty said innocently.\\n\\n Jake snatched back his beer. \"Oh blow me, Huey.\"\\n\\n \"Dusty,\" Dusty corrected.\\n\\n Tucker said, \"I\u0027m not sure this is a good idea. Maybe I should stay here and see how things pan out with the FAA. This guy wants me right away. I need more time.\"\\n\\n \"Like more time will make a difference. Damn, Tucker, you don\u0027t have to sink eyeball deep in shit to know it\u0027s a good idea to pull yourself out. Sometimes you have to make a decision.\"\\n\\n Tucker looked at the letter again. \"But I...\"\\n\\n Before Tucker could finish his protest, Jake brought the Lone Star in a screaming arc across Dusty Lemon\u0027s temple. The bodyguard fell like a dead tree and did a dead-cat bounce on the orange carpet.\\n\\n \"Jesus!\" Tucker said. \"What the fuck was that?\"\\n\\n \"A decision,\" Jake said. He looked up from the fallen tackle and took a pull on the foaming Lone Star. \"Sometimes this high-tech world calls for low-tech solutions. Let\u0027s go.\"\\n\\n 7\\n\\n Travel Tips\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t believe you hit him,\" Tucker said. He was in the passenger seat of Jake Skye\u0027s camouflaged Land Rover. It was much more car than was re-quired for the Houston expressway, but Jake was into equipment overkill. Everything he owned was Kevlar, GorTex, Polarfleece, titanium alloy, graphite-polymer composite, or of \"expedition quality.\" He liked machines, understood how they worked, and could fix them if they didn\u0027t. Sometimes he spoke in an incomprehensible alphabet soup of SRAM, DRAM, FOR-TRAN, LORAN, SIMMS, SAMS, and ROM. Tuck, on the other hand, knew most of the words to \"Mommas, Don\u0027t Let Your Babies Grow Up to Be Cowboys\" and could restore burned toast to new by scraping off the black stuff.\\n\\n Of the two, Jake was the cool one. Tucker had always found being cool a little elusive. As Jake put it, \"You\u0027ve got the look, but you can\u0027t walk the walk or talk the talk. Tucker, you are a hopeless geek trapped in a cool guy\u0027s body, but out of the goodness of my heart, I will take you on as my student.\" They\u0027d been friends for four years. Jake had taught Tuck to fly.\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be fine. He\u0027s a jock,\" Jake shouted over the buffeting wind. He hadn\u0027t bought a top for the Land Rover, opting instead for the Outback package with the \"patented rhinoceros poking platform.\"\\n\\n \"He was just a kid. He was reading the Bible.\"\\n\\n \"He would have ripped my arms off if I\u0027d let him.\"\\n\\n Tuck nodded. That was probably true. \"Where are we going?\"\\n\\n \"The airport. Everything you need is in that pack in the back.\"\\n\\n Tucker looked into the back of the Rover. There was a large backpack. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because if I don\u0027t get you out of the country right now, you\u0027re going to jail.\"\\n\\n \"Mary Jean said she had that handled. Said her lawyers were on it.\"\\n\\n \"Right, and I go around smacking kids with beer bottles for recreation. The hooker filed a civil suit this morning. Twenty million. Mary Jean has to throw you to the wolves to save her own ass. She has to let the court prove that you fucked up all on your own. I grabbed your passport and some clothes when I got your mail.\"\\n\\n \"Jake, I can\u0027t just take off like this. I\u0027m supposed to see a doctor tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"For what?\"\\n\\n Tuck pointed to the lump of bandages in his lap. \"What do you think? He\u0027s supposed to take this damn tube out of me.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll do it in the bathroom at the airport. There\u0027s some antibiotics in the first-aid kit in the pack. I confirmed you for a flight to Honolulu that leaves in an hour. From there you go to Guam, then to someplace called Truk. That\u0027s where this doctor is supposed to meet you. I\u0027ve got it all written down. There was an e-mail address at the bottom of the letter. I sent him a message to expect you tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"But my car, my apartment, my stuff.\"\\n\\n \"Your apartment is a pit and I put your stuff worth keeping in a ministorage. I\u0027ve got the pink slip for your Camaro. Sign it over to me. I\u0027ll sell it and send you the money.\"\\n\\n \"You were pretty fucking sure I\u0027d want to do this.\"\\n\\n \"What choice do you have?\"\\n\\n Jake parked the Land Rover in short-term parking, shouldered the pack, and led Tucker into the international terminal. They checked the pack and found a rest room near Tucker\u0027s departure gate.\\n\\n \"I can do this myself,\" Tucker said.\\n\\n Jake Skye was peering over the door into the stall where Tucker was preparing to remove his bandages and, finally, the catheter. A line of businessmen washed their hands at a line of lavatories while trying not to notice what was going on behind them in the stall.\\n\\n \"Just yank it,\" Jake Skye said.\\n\\n \"Give me a minute. I think they tied a knot inside it.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be a wuss, Tucker. Yank it.\"\\n\\n The businessmen at the sinks exchanged raised eyebrows and one by one broke for the rest room door.\\n\\n Jake said, \"I\u0027m going to give you to five, then I\u0027m coming over the stall and yanking it for you. One, two...\"\\n\\n A rodeo cowboy at the urinals hitched up his Wranglers, pulled his hat down, and made a bowlegged beeline for the door to get on a plane to someplace where this sort of thing didn\u0027t happen.\\n\\n \"Five!\"\\n\\n Security guards rushed through the terminal toward the screaming. Someone was being murdered in the men\u0027s room and they were responsible. They burst into the rest room with guns drawn. Jake Skye was coiling up some tubing by the sinks. There was whimpering coming from one of the stalls. \"Everything\u0027s fine, officers,\" Jake said. \"My friend\u0027s a little upset. He just found out that his mother died.\"\\n\\n \"My mother\u0027s not dead!\" Tucker said from the stall.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s in denial,\" Jake whispered to the guards. \"Here, you better takes this.\" He handed the tubing to one of the guards. \"We don\u0027t want him hanging himself in grief.\"\\n\\n Ten minutes later, after condolences from the security staff, they sat in the departure lounge drinking gin and tonics, waiting for Tuck\u0027s boarding call. Around them, a score of men and women in suits fired out phone calls on cell phones while twenty more performed an impromptu dog pile at the bar, trying to occupy the minuscule smoking area. Jake Skye was cataloging the contents of the pack he\u0027d given to Tuck. Tucker wasn\u0027t listening. He was overwhelmed with the speed with which his life had gone to shit, and he was desperately trying to sort it out. Jake\u0027s voice was lost like kazoo sounds in a wind tunnel.\\n\\n Jake droned, \"The stove will run on anything: diesel, jet fuel, gasoline, even vodka. There\u0027s a mask, fins, and snorkel, and a couple of waterproof flashlights.\"\\n\\n The job with Mary Jean had been perfect. A different city every few days, nice hotels, an expense account, and literally thousands of earnest Mary Jean ladies to indulge him. And they did, one or two at each convention. Inspired by Mary Jean\u0027s speeches on self-determination, motivation, and how they too could be a winner, they sought Tucker out to have their one adventurous affair with a jet pilot. And because no matter how many times it happened, he was always somewhat surprised by their advances, Tucker played a part.\\n\\n He behaved like a man torn from the cover of some steamy romance novel: the charming rogue, the passionate pirate who would, come morning, take his ship to sea for God, Queen, and Country. Of course, usually, sometime before morning, the women would realize that under the smooth, gin-painted exterior was a guy who sniffed his shorts to check their wearability. But for a moment, for them and for him, he had been cool. Sleazy, but cool.\\n\\n When the sleaze got to him, he needed only to suck a few hits of oxygen from the cabin cylinder to chase the hangover, then pull the pink jet into the sky to convince himself he was a professional, competent and in control. At altitude he turned it all over to the autopilot.\\n\\n But now he couldn\u0027t seduce anyone or allow himself to be seduced, and he wasn\u0027t sure he could fly. The crash had juiced him of his confidence. It wasn\u0027t the impact or even the injuries. It was that last moment, when the guy, or the angel, or whatever it was appeared in the copilot\u0027s seat.\\n\\n \"You ever think about God?\" Tucker asked Jake.\\n\\n Jake Skye\u0027s face went dead with incomprehension. \"You\u0027re going to need to know about this stuff if you get into trouble. Kinda like checking the fuel gauges - if you know what I mean.\"\\n\\n Tucker winced. \"Look, I heard every word you said. This seemed important all of a sudden, you know?\"\\n\\n \"Well, in that case, Tuck, yes, I do think about God sometimes. When I\u0027m with a really hot babe, and we\u0027re going at it like sweaty monkeys, I think about it then. I think about a big old pissed-off Sistine Chapel finger-pointin\u0027 motherfucker. And you know what? It works. You don\u0027t come when you\u0027re thinking about shit like that. You should try it sometime. Oh, sorry.\"\\n\\n \"Never mind,\" Tucker said.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t let that kid with the Bible get to you. He\u0027s too young to have given up on religion...doesn\u0027t have enough sin under his belt. Guys like us, best bet is that it\u0027s all bullshit and we go directly to worm food. Try not to think about it.\"\\n\\n \"Right,\" Tucker said, totally unsatisfied. If you had a question about any piece of gadgetry on the planet, Jake Skye was your man. But spiritually, he was a hamster. Which, actually, was one of the things Tucker used to like about him. He tried not to think about it and changed the subject.\\n\\n \"So what do I need to know about flying a Lear 45?\"\\n\\n Jake seemed relieved to be back into the realm of technology. \"I haven\u0027t seen one yet, but they say it flies just like Mary Jean\u0027s old Lear 25, only faster and a longer range. Better avionics. Read the manuals when you get there.\"\\n\\n \"What about navigation equipment?\" Tucker\u0027s navigation was weak. Since he\u0027d gotten his jet license, he\u0027d depended completely on automatic systems.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be fine. You don\u0027t buy a four-million-dollar plane and cheap out on the navigation and radios. This doctor\u0027s got an e-mail address, which means he\u0027s got a computer. You\u0027ll be able to access charts and weather, and file flight plans with that. Check the facilities at your destinations, so you\u0027ll know what to expect. Some of these Third World airstrips just have a native with a candle for night landings. And check your fuel availability. They\u0027ll sell you sewer water instead of jet fuel if you don\u0027t check. You ever deal with Third World airport cops?\"\\n\\n Tucker shrugged. Jake knew damn well he hadn\u0027t. He\u0027d gotten his hours flying copilot in the Mary Jean jet, and they\u0027d never taken that outside of the continental United States except for one trip to Hawaii.\\n\\n \"Well,\" Jake continued, \"the catchword is \u0027bribe, bribe, and bribe.\u0027 Offer the highest amount you can at the lowest level of authority. Always have a thick roll of American dollars with you, and don\u0027t bring it to the table if you\u0027re not willing to lose it. Keep something stashed in your shoe if they tap you out.\"\\n\\n \"You think this doctor is going to have me hauling drugs?\"\\n\\n \"Good chance of it, don\u0027t you think? Besides, it doesn\u0027t matter. These people are brutal. Half the time the government guys have the same last name, so if you move up the ladder, you\u0027re just talking to the uncle of the last one that hit you. He has to charge you more out of pride.\"\\n\\n Tucker cradled his head in his hands and stared into his gin and tonic. \"I\u0027m fucked.\"\\n\\n Jake patted him on the arm, then drew back at the intimacy of the act. \"They\u0027re calling your flight. You\u0027ll be fine.\"\\n\\n They rose and Jake threw some cash on the table. At the gate Tucker turned to his friend. \"Man, I don\u0027t know what to say.\"\\n\\n Jake extended his hand. \"No sweat, man. You\u0027d have done it for me.\"\\n\\n \"I really hate flying in the back. Check on that kid from the motel, okay.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m on it. Look, everything you need is in the pack. Don\u0027t leave it behind.\"\\n\\n \"Right,\" Tucker said. \"Well...\" He turned and walked down the ramp to the plane.\\n\\n Jake Skye watched him go, then turned, walked to a pay phone, dialed some numbers, and waited. \"Yeah, it\u0027s Jake. He\u0027s on his way. Yeah, gone for good. When can I pick up my check?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/island-of-the-sequined-love-nun/page-2.html","bookId":2048,"book":{"id":2048,"title":"Island of the Sequined Love Nun","description":"Storyline: Pilot Tucker Case has a weakness--well, Tuck really has two--and the combination of drinking and sex in the cockpit of the pink Mary Jean Cosmetics Learjet puts him on the front page of papers all over the planet.
