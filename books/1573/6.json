{"id":110171,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Pretty Boring \"I think you\u0027re ready.\" Tally cruised to a stop - right foot down, left foot up, bend the knees. \"Ready for what?\" Shay drifted slowly past, letting the breeze tug her along. They were as high up and far out as hoverboards would go, just above treetop level, at the edge of town. It was amazing how quickly Tally had gotten used to being up high, with nothing but a board and bracelets between her and a long fall. The view from up here was fantastic. Behind them the spires of New Pretty Town rose from the center of town, and around them was the greenbelt, a swath of forest that separated the middle and the late pretties from the youngsters. Older generations of pretties lived out in the suburbs, hidden by the hills, in rows of big houses separated by strips of private garden for their littlies to play in. Shay smiled. \"Ready for a night ride.\" \"Oh. Look, I don\u0027t know if I want to cross the river again,\" Tally said, remembering her promise to Peris. She and Shay had shown each other a lot of tricks over the last three weeks, but they hadn\u0027t been back into New Pretty Town since the night they\u0027d met. \"Until we get turned, of course. After last time, the wardens are probably all - \" \"I wasn\u0027t talking about New Pretty Town,\" Shay interrupted. \"That place is boring, anyway. We\u0027d have to sneak around all night.\" \"Okay. You mean just board around Uglyville.\" Shay shook her head, still coasting gradually away on the breeze. Tally shifted her weight on the board uncomfortably. \"Where else is there?\" Shay put her hands in her pockets and spread her arms, turning her dorm\u0027s team jacket into a sail. The breeze pulled her farther away from Tally. By reflex, Tally tipped her toes forward so that her board would keep up. \"Well, there\u0027s out there.\" Shay nodded at the open land before them. \"The suburbs? That\u0027s dullsville.\" \"Not the burbs. Past them.\" Shay slid her feet in opposite directions, to the very edges of the board. Her skirt caught the cool evening wind, which tugged her away even faster. She was drifting toward the outer edge of the greenbelt. Off-limits. Tally planted her feet and dipped the board, and pulled up next to her friend. \"What do you mean? Outside the city completely?\" \"Yeah.\" \"That\u0027s crazy. There\u0027s nothing out there.\" \"There\u0027s plenty out there. Real trees, hundreds of years old. Mountains. And the ruins. Ever been there?\" Tally blinked. \"Of course.\" \"I don\u0027t mean on a school trip, Tally. You ever been there at night?\" Tally brought her board to a sharp halt. The Rusty Ruins were the remains of an old city, a hulking reminder of back when there\u0027d been way too many people, and everyone was incredibly stupid. And ugly. \"No way. Don\u0027t tell me you have.\" Shay nodded. Tally\u0027s mouth dropped open. \"That\u0027s impossible.\" \"You think you\u0027re the only one who knows good tricks?\" \"Well, maybe I believe you,\" Tally said. Shay had that look on her face, the one Tally had learned to watch out for. \"But what if we get busted?\" Shay laughed. \"Tally, there\u0027s nothing out there, like you just said. Nothing and no one to bust us.\" \"Do hoverboards even work out there? Does anything?\" \"Special ones do, if you know how to trick them, and where to ride. And getting past the burbs is easy. You take the river the whole way. Farther upstream it\u0027s white water, too rough for skimmers.\" Tally\u0027s mouth dropped open again. \"You really have done this before.\" A gust of wind billowed in Shay\u0027s jacket, and she slid farther away, still smiling. Tally had to lean her board into motion again to stay within earshot. A treetop brushed her ankles as the ground below them started to rise. \"It\u0027ll be really fun,\" Shay called. \"Sounds too risky.\" \"Come on. I\u0027ve been wanting to show you this since we met. Since you told me you crashed a pretty party - and pulled a fire alarm!\" Tally swallowed, wishing she\u0027d told the whole truth about that night - about how it had all just sort of happened . Shay seemed to think she was the world\u0027s biggest daredevil now. \"Well, I mean, that alarm thing was partly an accident. Kind of.\" \"Yeah, sure.\" \"I mean, maybe we should wait. It\u0027s only a couple of months now.\" \"Oh, that\u0027s right,\" Shay said. \"A couple of months and we\u0027ll be stuck inside the river. Pretty and boring.\" Tally snorted. \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s exactly boring, Shay.\" \"Doing what you\u0027re supposed to do isalways boring. I can\u0027t imagine anything worse than being required to have fun.\" \"I can,\" Tally said quietly. \"Never having any.\" \"Listen, Tally, these two months are our last chance to do anything really cool. To be ourselves. Once we turn, it\u0027s new pretty, middle pretty, late pretty.\" Shay dropped her arms, and her board stopped drifting. \"Then dead pretty.\" \"Better than dead ugly,\" Tally said. Shay shrugged and opened her jacket into a sail again. They weren\u0027t far from the edge of the greenbelt now. Soon Shay would get a warning. Then her board would tattle. \"Besides,\" Tally argued, \"just because we get the operation doesn\u0027t mean we can\u0027t do stuff like this.\" \"But pretties never do, Tally. Never.\" Tally sighed, tipping her feet again to follow. \"Maybe that\u0027s because they have better stuff to do than kid tricks. Maybe partying in town is better than hanging out in a bunch of old ruins.\" Shay\u0027s eyes flashed. \"Or maybe when they do the operation - when they grind and stretch your bones to the right shape, peel off your face and rub all your skin away, and stick in plastic cheekbones so you look like everybody else - maybe after going through all that you just aren\u0027t very interesting anymore.\" Tally flinched. She\u0027d never heard the operation described that way. Even in bio class, where they went into the details, it didn\u0027t sound that bad. \"Come on, we won\u0027t even know it\u0027s happening. You just have pretty dreams the whole time.\" \"Yeah, sure.\" A voice came into Tally\u0027s head:\"Warning, restricted area.\" The wind was turning cold as the sun dropped. \"Come on, Shay, let\u0027s go back down. It\u0027s almost dinner.\" Shay smiled and shook her head, and pulled off her interface ring. Now she wouldn\u0027t hear the warnings. \"Let\u0027s go tonight. You can ride almost as well as me now.\" \"Shay.\" \"Do this with me. I\u0027ll show you a roller coaster.\" \"What\u0027s a - \" \"Second warning. Restricted area.\" Tally stopped her board. \"If you keep going, Shay, you\u0027ll get busted and we won\u0027t be doing anything tonight.\" Shay shrugged as the wind tugged her farther away. \"I just want to show you something that\u0027s my idea of fun, Tally. Before we go all pretty and only get to have everybody else\u0027s idea of fun.\" Tally shook her head, wanting to say that Shay had already taught her how to hoverboard, the coolest thing she\u0027d ever learned. In less than a month she\u0027d come to feel like they were best friends. Almost like when she\u0027d met Peris as a littlie, and they\u0027d known instantly they\u0027d be together forever. \"Shay...\" \"Please?\" Tally sighed. \"Okay.\" Shay dropped her arms and dipped her toes to bring the board to a halt. \"Really? Tonight?\" \"Sure. Rusty Ruins it is.\" Tally told herself to relax. It wasn\u0027t that big a deal, really. She broke rules all the time, and everyone went to the ruins once a year on school trips. It couldn\u0027t be dangerous or anything. Shay zoomed back from the edge of the belt, swooping up beside Tally to put her arm around her. \"Wait until you see the river.\" \"You said it\u0027s got white water?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Which is what?\" Shay smiled. \"It\u0027s water. But much, much better.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/uglies-uglies-1/page-6.html","bookId":1573,"book":{"id":1573,"title":"Uglies (Uglies #1)","description":"Storyline: Uglies (Uglies #1) Tally Youngblood is about to turn sixteen, and she can\u0027t wait for the operation that turns everyone from a repellent ugly into a stunningly attractive pretty and catapults you into a high-tech paradise where your only job is to party.
