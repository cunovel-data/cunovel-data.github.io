But just because we were dorks doesn\u0027t mean they\u0027re not.\"\n Tally nodded, trying to remember what being twelve was like, what the dorm had looked like on her first day there. She remembered how intimidating the building had seemed. Much bigger than Sol and Ellie\u0027s house, of course, and bigger than the huts that littlies went to school in, one teacher and ten students to each one.\n Now the dorm seemed so small and claustrophobic. Painfully childish, with its bright colors and padded stairs. So boring during the day and easy to escape at night.\n The new uglies all stuck together in a tight group, afraid to stray too far from their guide. Their ugly little faces peered up at the dorm\u0027s four-story height, their eyes full of wonder and terror.\n Shay pulled her head back in through the window. \"This is going to be so fun.\"\n \"It\u0027ll be one orientation they won\u0027t forget.\"\n Summer was over in two weeks. The population of Tally\u0027s dorm had been steadily dropping for the last year as seniors turned sixteen. It was almost time for a new batch to take their place. Tally watched the last few uglies make their way inside, gawky and nervous, unkempt and uncoordinated. Twelve was definitely the turning point, when you changed from a cute littlie into an oversize, under-educated ugly.\n It was a stage of life she was glad to be leaving behind.\n \"You sure this thing is going to work?\" Shay asked.\n Tally smiled. It wasn\u0027t often that Shay was the cautious one. She pointed at the collar of the bungee jacket. \"You see that little green light? That means it\u0027s working. It\u0027s for emergencies, so it\u0027s always ready to go.\"\n Shay\u0027s hand slipped under the jacket to pull at her belly sensor, which meant she was nervous. \"What if it knows there\u0027s no real emergency?\"\n \"It\u0027s not that smart. You fall, it catches you. No tricks necessary.\"\n Shay shrugged and put it on.\n They\u0027d borrowed the jacket from the art school, the tallest building in Uglyville. It was a spare from the basement, and they hadn\u0027t even had to trick the rack to get it free. Tally definitely didn\u0027t want to get caught messing around with fire alarms, in case the wardens connected her to a certain incident in New Pretty Town back at the beginning of summer.\n Shay pulled an oversize basketball jersey over the bungee jacket. It was in her dorm\u0027s colors, and none of the teachers here knew her face very well. \"How\u0027s that look?\"\n \"Like you\u0027ve gained weight. It suits you.\"\n Shay scowled. She hated being called Stick Insect, or Pig-Eyes, or any of the other things uglies called one another. Shay sometimes claimed that she didn\u0027t care if she ever got the operation. It was crazy talk, of course. Shay wasn\u0027t exactly afreak, but she was hardly a natural-born pretty. There\u0027d only been about ten of those in all of history, after all. \"Doyou want to do the jump, Squint?\"\n \"I have both been there and done that, Shay, before I even met you. And you\u0027re the one who had this brilliant idea.\"\n Shay\u0027s scowl faded into a smile. \"It is brilliant, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"They\u0027ll never know what hit them.\"\n They waited until the new uglies were in the library, scattered around the worktables to watch some orientation video. Shay and Tally lay on their stomachs on the top floor of the stacks, where the dusty old paper books were stored, peering through the guardrails down at the group. They waited for the tour leader to quiet the chattering uglies.\n \"This is almost too easy,\" Shay said, penciling a pair of fat, black eyebrows over her own.\n \"Easy for you. You\u0027ll be out the door before anyone knows what\u0027s happened. I\u0027ve got to make it all the way down the stairs.\"\n \"So what, Tally? What are they going to do if we get caught?\"\n Tally shrugged. \"True.\" But she pulled on her mousy brown wig anyway.\n Over the summer, as the last few seniors turned sixteen and pretty, the tricks had grown worse and worse. But nobody ever seemed to get punished, and Tally\u0027s promise to Peris seemed ages ago. Once she was pretty, nothing she\u0027d done in this last month would matter. She was anxious to leave it all behind, but not without a big finish.\n Thinking of Peris, Tally stuck on a big plastic nose. They\u0027d raided the drama room at Shay\u0027s dorm the night before and were loaded with disguises. \"Ready?\" she asked. Then she giggled at the nasal twang the fake nose gave her voice.\n \"Hang on.\" Shay grabbed a big, fat book from the shelf. \"Okay, showtime.\"\n They stood up.\n \"Give me that book!\" Tally shouted at Shay. \"It\u0027s mine!\"\n She heard the uglies below fall silent, and had to resist looking down to see their upturned faces.\n \"No way, Pignose! I checked it out first.\"\n \"Are you kidding, Fattie? You can\u0027t even read!\"\n \"Oh, yeah? Well, readthis !\"\n Shay swung the book at Tally, who ducked. She snatched it away and swung back, catching Shay solidly on her upraised forearms. Shay rolled back at the impact, spinning over the railing.\n Tally leaned forward, watching wide-eyed as Shay tumbled down toward the library\u0027s main floor, three stories below. The new uglies screamed in unison, scattering away from the flailing body plummeting toward them.\n A second later the bungee jacket activated, and Shay bobbed back up in midair, laughing maniacally at the top of her lungs. Tally waited another moment, watching the uglies\u0027 horror dissolve into confusion as Shay bounced again, then righted herself on one of the tables and headed for the door.\n Tally dropped the book and dashed for the stairs, leaping a flight at a time until she reached the back exit of the dorm.\n \"Oh, that was perfect!\"\n \"Did you see their faces?\"\n \"Not actually,\" Shay said. \"I was kind of busy watching the floor coming at me.\"\n \"Yeah, I remember that from jumping off the roof. It does catch your attention.\"\n \"Speaking of faces, love the nose.\"\n Tally giggled, pulling it off. \"Yeah, no point in being uglier than usual.\"\n Shay\u0027s face clouded. She wiped off an eyebrow, then looked up sharply. \"You\u0027re not ugly.\"\n \"Oh, come on, Shay.\"\n \"No, I mean it.\" She reached out and touched Tally\u0027s real nose. \"Your profile is great.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be weird, Shay. I\u0027m an ugly, you\u0027re an ugly. We will be for two more weeks. It\u0027s no big deal or anything.\" She laughed. \"You, for example, have one giant eyebrow and one tiny one.\"\n Shay looked away, stripping off the rest of her disguise in silence.\n They were hidden in the changing rooms beside the sandy beach, where they\u0027d left their interface rings and a spare set of clothes. If anyone asked, they\u0027d say they were swimming the whole time. Swimming was a great trick. It hid your body-heat signature, involved changing clothes, and was a perfect excuse for not wearing your interface ring. The river washed away all crimes.\n A minute later they splashed out into the water, sinking the disguises. The bungee jacket would go back to the art school basement that night.\n \"I\u0027m serious, Tally,\" Shay said once they were out in the water. \"Your nose isn\u0027t ugly. I like your eyes, too.\"\n \"My eyes? Now you\u0027re totally crazy. They\u0027re way too close together.\"\n \"Who says?\"\n \"Biology says.\"\n Shay splashed a handful of water at her. \"You don\u0027t believe all that crap, do you - that there\u0027s only one way to look, and everyone\u0027s programmed to agree on it?\"\n \"It\u0027s not about believing, Shay. You justknow it. You\u0027ve seen pretties. They look...wonderful.\"\n \"They all look the same.\"\n \"I used to think that too. But when Peris and I would go into town, we\u0027d see a lot of them, and we realized that pretties do look different. They look like themselves. It\u0027s just a lot more subtle, because they\u0027re not all freaks.\"\n \"We\u0027re not freaks, Tally.We\u0027re normal. We may not be gorgeous, but at least we\u0027re not hyped-up Barbie dolls.\"\n \"What kind of dolls?\"\n She looked away. \"It\u0027s something David told me about.\"\n \"Oh, great. David again.\" Tally pushed away and floated on her back, looking up at the sky and wishing this conversation would end. They\u0027d been out to the ruins a few more times, and Shay always insisted on setting off a sparkler, but David had never showed. The whole thing gave Tally the creeps, waiting around in the dead city for some guy who didn\u0027t seem to exist. It was great exploring out there, but Shay\u0027s obsession with David had started to sour it for Tally.\n \"He\u0027s real. I\u0027ve met him more than once.\"\n \"Okay, Shay, David\u0027s real. But so is being ugly. You can\u0027t change it just by wishing, or by telling yourself that you\u0027re pretty. That\u0027s why they invented the operation.\"\n \"But it\u0027s a trick, Tally. You\u0027ve only seen pretty faces your whole life. Your parents, your teachers, everyone over sixteen. But you weren\u0027tborn expecting that kind of beauty in everyone, all the time. You just got programmed into thinking anything else is ugly.\"\n \"It\u0027s not programming, it\u0027s just a natural reaction. And more important than that, it\u0027s fair. In the old days it was all random - some peoplekind of pretty, most people ugly all their lives. Now everyone\u0027s ugly...until they\u0027re pretty. No losers.\"\n Shay was silent for a while, then said, \"There are losers, Tally.\"\n Tally shivered. Everyone knew about uglies-for-life, the few people for whom the operation wouldn\u0027t work. You didn\u0027t see them around much. They were allowed in public, but most of them preferred to hide. Who wouldn\u0027t? Uglies might look goofy, but at least they were young.Old uglies were really unbelievable.\n \"Is that it? Are you worried about the operation not working? That\u0027s silly, Shay. You\u0027re no freak. In two weeks you\u0027ll be as pretty as anyone else.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to be pretty.\"\n Tally sighed. This again.\n \"I\u0027m sick of this city,\" Shay continued. \"I\u0027m sick of the rules and boundaries. The last thing I want is to become some empty-headed new pretty, having one big party all day.\"\n \"Come on, Shay. They do all the same stuff we do: bungee jump, fly, play with fireworks. Only they don\u0027t have to sneak around.\"\n \"They don\u0027t have the imagination to sneak around.\"\n \"Look, Skinny, I\u0027m with you,\" Tally said sharply. \"Doing tricks is great! Okay? Breaking the rules is fun!\n But eventually you\u0027ve got to do something besides being a clever little ugly.\"\n \"Like being a vapid, boring pretty?\"\n \"No, like being an adult. Did you ever think that when you\u0027re pretty you might notneed to play tricks and mess things up? Maybe just being ugly is why uglies always fight and pick on one another, because they aren\u0027t happy with who they are. Well, I want to be happy, and looking like a real person is the first step.\"\n \"I\u0027m not afraid of looking the way I do, Tally.\"\n \"Maybe not, but you are afraid of growing up!\"\n Shay didn\u0027t say anything. Tally floated in silence, looking up at the sky, barely able to see the clouds through her anger. She wanted to be pretty, wanted to see Peris again. It seemed like forever since she\u0027d talked to him, or to anyone else except Shay. She was sick of this whole ugly business, and just wanted it to end.\n A minute later, she heard Shay swimming for shore. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/uglies-uglies-1/page-10.html","bookId":1573,"book":{"id":1573,"title":"Uglies (Uglies #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Uglies (Uglies #1) \n Tally Youngblood is about to turn sixteen, and she can\u0027t wait for the operation that turns everyone from a repellent ugly into a stunningly attractive pretty and catapults you into a high-tech paradise where your only job is to party.
