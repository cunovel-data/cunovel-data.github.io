{"id":110200,"no":50,"title":"Page 50","content":"Down the River\\n\\n Before leaving, Tally wrote a letter to herself.\\n\\n It was Maddy\u0027s idea, to put her consent in writing. That way, even as a pretty, unable to comprehend why she would ever want her brain fixed, Tally could at least read her own words and know what was about to happen.\\n\\n \"Whatever makes you feel better,\" Tally said. \"As long as you cure me, no matter what I say. Don\u0027t leave me like Shay.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll cure you, Tally. I promise. I just need written consent.\" Maddy handed her a pen and a small, precious piece of paper.\\n\\n \"I never learned penmanship,\" Tally said. \"They don\u0027t require it anymore.\"\\n\\n Maddy shook her head sadly and said, \"Okay. You dictate, and I\u0027ll write it.\"\\n\\n \"Not you. Shay can write it for me. She took a class, back when she was trying to get to the Smoke.\"\\n\\n Tally remembered the scrawl of Shay\u0027s directions to the Smoke, clumsy but readable.\\n\\n The letter didn\u0027t take long. Shay giggled at Tally\u0027s heartfelt words, but she wrote them down as directed.\\n\\n There was something earnest in the way she put stylus to paper, like a littlie learning how to read.\\n\\n When they were finished, David still hadn\u0027t come back. He\u0027d taken one of the hoverboards in the direction of the ruins. As she put away her things, Tally kept glancing at the window, hoping he would return.\\n\\n But Maddy was probably right. If Tally saw him again, she would just talk herself out of this. Or maybe David would stop her.\\n\\n Or worse, maybe he wouldn\u0027t.\\n\\n But no matter what David said now, he would always remember what she had done, the lives she had cost with her secrets. This was the only way Tally could be certain that he had forgiven her. If he came to rescue her, she would know.\\n\\n \"So, let\u0027s get moving,\" Shay said when they were done.\\n\\n \"Shay, I\u0027m not going to be gone forever. I\u0027d rather you...\"\\n\\n \"Come on. I\u0027m sick of this place.\"\\n\\n Tally bit her lip. What was the point of giving herself up if Shay was coming too? Of course, they could always snatch her away again as well. Once the cure was proven to work, they could give it to anyone.\\n\\n Or everyone.\\n\\n \"The only reason I\u0027ve been hanging around this dump is to try to get you to come back,\" Shay said, then lowered her voice. \"You know, it\u0027s my fault you\u0027re not already pretty. I messed up everything by running away. I owe you.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Shay.\" Tally\u0027s head began to spin. She closed her eyes.\\n\\n \"Maddy always says I can go anytime. You don\u0027t want me to go back all alone, do you?\"\\n\\n Tally tried to imagine Shay hiking to the river alone. \"No, I guess not.\" She looked at her friend\u0027s face and saw a spark in her eyes, something real ignited by the idea of going on a trip with Tally.\\n\\n \"Please! We\u0027ll have a blast in New Pretty Town.\"\\n\\n Tally spread her hands. \"Okay. I guess I can\u0027t stop you.\"\\n\\n They rode together on one hoverboard. Croy came along on another, to take the boards back when they reached the city\u0027s edge.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t talk the whole way down. The other New Smokies had all heard the fight outside, and finally knew what Tally had done. It must have been worse for Croy. He had suspected, and she\u0027d lied to him face-to-face. He was probably wishing he\u0027d stopped Tally himself before she\u0027d had a chance to betray them all.\\n\\n When they reached the greenbelt, though, he forced himself to look at her. \"What did they do to you, anyway? To make you do something like that?\"\\n\\n \"They said I couldn\u0027t turn, until I\u0027d found Shay.\"\\n\\n He looked away, staring at the lights of New Pretty Town, bright in the clear cold of a November night.\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re finally getting your wish.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. I guess.\"\\n\\n \"Tally\u0027s going to be pretty!\" Shay said.\\n\\n Croy ignored her and looked at Tally again. \"Thanks for rescuing me, though. That was some trick you guys pulled off. I hope that...\" He shrugged, and shook his head. \"See you later.\"\\n\\n \"I hope so.\"\\n\\n Croy stuck the boards together and headed back up the river.\\n\\n \"This is going to be the best!\" Shay said. \"I can\u0027t wait for you to meet all my new friends. And you can finally introduce me to Peris.\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n They walked down toward Uglyville until they found themselves in Cleopatra Park. The earth was hard underneath their feet in the late autumn chill, and they huddled close against the cold. Tally wore her Smoke-made sweater. She\u0027d wanted Maddy to keep it for her, but she\u0027d left her microfiber jacket behind instead. City-made clothes were too valuable to waste on someone going back to civilization.\\n\\n \"You see, I was already getting popular,\" Shay was saying. \"Having a criminal past is the only way into the really good parties. I mean, no one wants to hear about what classes you took in ugly school.\" She giggled.\\n\\n \"We should be a hit, then.\"\\n\\n \"Duh. When we tell everyone about your kidnapping me right out of Special Circumstances headquarters? And how I talked you into escaping from that band of freaks? But we\u0027re going to have to tone it down, Squint. No one\u0027s ever going to believe the truth!\"\\n\\n \"No, you\u0027re right about that.\"\\n\\n Tally thought of the letter she\u0027d left with Maddy. Wouldshe even believe the truth in a few weeks\u0027 time?\\n\\n How would the words of a fugitive, desperate, tragic ugly look through pretty eyes?\\n\\n For that matter, what was David going to look like after she\u0027d been surrounded by new pretty faces twenty-four hours a day? Would she really believe all that stuff about ugliness again, or would she remember how someone could be beautiful even without surgery? Tally tried to picture David\u0027s face, but it hurt to think of how long it would be before she saw him again.\\n\\n She wondered how long it would take after the operation, before she would stop missing David. It might be a few days before the lesions completely took hold of her, Maddy had warned. But that didn\u0027t mean it was her own mind, changing itself.\\n\\n Maybe if she decided to go on missing him, no matter what, Tally could keep her mind from changing.\\n\\n Unlike most people, sheknew about the lesions. Maybe she could beat them.\\n\\n A dark shape passed overhead, a warden\u0027s hovercar, and Tally instinctively froze. The city uglies had said there were more patrols out these days. The regular authorities had finally noticed that things were changing.\\n\\n The hovercar halted, then settled softly onto the earth next to them. A door slid open, and a blinding light popped on. \"All right, you kids...oh, sorry, miss.\"\\n\\n The light was on Shay\u0027s face. Then it flicked across to Tally.\\n\\n \"What are you two...?\" The warden\u0027s voice stumbled. Didn\u0027t this beat everything? A pretty and an ugly taking a stroll together. The warden came closer, confusion all over his middle-pretty face.\\n\\n Tally smiled. At least she was causing trouble to the end.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Tally Youngblood,\" she said. \"Make me pretty.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/uglies-uglies-1/page-50.html","bookId":1573,"book":{"id":1573,"title":"Uglies (Uglies #1)","description":"Storyline: Uglies (Uglies #1) \\n Tally Youngblood is about to turn sixteen, and she can\u0027t wait for the operation that turns everyone from a repellent ugly into a stunningly attractive pretty and catapults you into a high-tech paradise where your only job is to party.
