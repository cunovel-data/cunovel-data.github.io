{"id":110189,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"Heartthrob\n Around the fire at dinner that night, Tally told the story of how she\u0027d hidden in the river when the rangers\u0027 helicopter first appeared. She had everyone wide-eyed again. Apparently, she\u0027d had one of the more exciting journeys to the Smoke.\n \"Can you imagine? I\u0027m naked and crouching down in the water, and this Rusty machine is destroying my camp!\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t they land?\" Astrix asked. \"Didn\u0027t they see your stuff?\"\n \"I thought they did.\"\n \"The rangers only pick up uglies in the white flowers,\" David explained. \"That\u0027s the rendezvous spot we tell runaways to use. They can\u0027t just pick up anyone, or they might accidentally bring a spy here.\"\n \"I guess you wouldn\u0027t want that,\" Tally said softly.\n \"Still, they should be more careful with those helicopters,\" Shay said. \"Someone\u0027s going to get chopped to pieces one day.\"\n \"Tell me about it. The wind almost took my hoverboard away,\" Tally said. \"It lifted my sleeping bag right off the ground and up into the blades. It was totally shredded.\" She was pleased by the amazement on the faces of her audience.\n \"So where\u0027d you sleep?\" Croy asked.\n \"It wasn\u0027t that bad. It was only for - \" Tally stopped herself just in time. She\u0027d spent one night without the sleeping bag, but in her cover story she\u0027d spent four days in the orchids. \"It was warm enough.\"\n \"You\u0027d better get a new one before bedtime,\" David said. \"It\u0027s a lot colder up here than down in the weeds.\"\n \"I\u0027ll take her over to the trading post,\" Shay said. \"It\u0027s like a requisition center, Tally. Only when you get something, you have to leave something else behind as payment.\"\n Tally shifted uncomfortably in her seat. She still hadn\u0027t gotten used to the idea that you had topay for things here. \"All I\u0027ve got is SpagBol.\"\n Shay smiled. \"That\u0027s perfect to trade with. We can\u0027t make dehydrated food here, except fruit, and traveling with regular food is a total pain. SpagBol\u0027s good as gold.\"\n After dinner, Shay took her to a large hut near the center of town. The shelves were full of things made in the Smoke, along with a few objects that had come from the cities. The city-made stuff was mostly shabby and worn, repaired again and again, but the handmade things fascinated Tally. She ran her still-raw fingers across the clay pots and wooden tools, amazed at how each had its own texture and weight. Everything seemed so heavy and...serious.\n An older ugly was running the place, but he wasn\u0027t as scary as the Boss. He brought out woolen gear and a few silvery sleeping bags. The blankets, scarves, and gloves were beautiful, in subdued colors and simple patterns, but Shay insisted that Tally get a city-made sleeping bag. \"Much lighter, and it squishes up small. Much better for when we go exploring.\"\n \"Of course,\" Tally said, trying to smile. \"That\u0027ll be great.\"\n She wound up trading twelve packets of SpagBol for another sleeping bag, and six for a handmade sweater, which left her with eight. She couldn\u0027t believe that the sweater, brown with bands of pale red and green highlights, cost half as much as the sleeping bag, which was threadbare and patched.\n \"You\u0027re just lucky you didn\u0027t lose your water purifier,\" Shay said as they walked home. \"Those things are impossible to trade for.\"\n Tally\u0027s eyes widened. \"What happens if they break?\"\n \"Well, they say you can drink water from the streams without purifying it.\"\n \"You\u0027re kidding.\"\n \"Nope. A lot of the older Smokies do,\" Shay said. \"Even if they\u0027ve got a purifier, they don\u0027t bother.\"\n \"Yuck.\"\n Shay giggled. \"Yeah, no kidding. But hey, you can always use mine.\"\n Tally put a hand on Shay\u0027s shoulder. \"Same goes for mine.\"\n Shay\u0027s pace slowed. \"Tally?\"\n \"Yeah?\"\n \"You were going to say something to me, back in the library, before the Boss started yelling at you.\"\n Tally\u0027s stomach sank. She pulled away, her fingers automatically going to the pendant at her neck.\n \"Yeah,\" Shay said. \"About that necklace.\"\n Tally nodded, but didn\u0027t know how to start. She still hadn\u0027t activated the pendant, and since her conversation with David, she wasn\u0027t sure she could. Maybe if she returned to the city in a month, starving and empty-handed, Dr. Cable would take mercy on her.\n But what if the woman kept her promise, and Tally never got the operation? In twenty-something years, she would be lined and wrinkled, as ugly as the Boss, an outcast. And if she stayed here in the Smoke, she\u0027d be sleeping in an old sleeping bag and dreading the day her water purifier broke down.\n She was so tired of lying to everyone. \"I haven\u0027t told you everything,\" she started.\n \"I know. But I think I\u0027ve got it figured out.\"\n Tally looked at her friend, afraid to speak.\n \"I mean, it\u0027s pretty obvious, right? You\u0027re all upset because you broke your promise to me. You didn\u0027t keep the Smoke a secret.\"\n Tally\u0027s mouth fell open.\n Shay smiled, taking her hand. \"As you got closer to your birthday, you decided you wanted to run away.\n But in the meantime, you met someone. Someone important. The same someone who gave you that heart necklace. So you broke your promise to me. You told that someone where you were going.\"\n \"Um, kind of,\" Tally managed.\n Shay giggled. \"Iknew it. That\u0027s why you\u0027ve been all nervous. You want to be here, but you also wish you were somewhere else. With someone else. And before you ran away, you left directions, a copy of my note, in case your new heartthrob wants to join us. Am I right or am I right?\"\n Tally bit her lip. Shay\u0027s face glowed in the moonlight, obviously thrilled with herself for figuring out Tally\u0027s big secret. \"Uh, you\u0027re partly right.\"\n \"Oh, Tally.\" Shay grabbed both her shoulders. \"Don\u0027t you see that it\u0027s okay? I mean, I did the same thing.\"\n Tally frowned. \"What do you mean?\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t supposed to tell anyone I was coming here. David made me promise I wouldn\u0027t even tell you.\"\n \"Why?\"\n Shay nodded. \"He hadn\u0027t met you, and wasn\u0027t sure if he could trust you. Normally, runaways only recruit old friends, people they\u0027ve tricked with for years. But I\u0027d only known you since the beginning of summer. And I never once mentioned the Smoke to you until the day before I left. I was never brave enough, in case you said no.\"\n \"So you weren\u0027t supposed to tell me?\"\n \"No way. So when you actually showed up, it made everyone nervous. They don\u0027t know whether they can trust you. Even David\u0027s been acting weird around me.\"\n \"Shay, I\u0027m so sorry.\"\n \"It\u0027s not your fault!\" Shay shook her head vigorously. \"It\u0027s mine. I screwed everything up. But so what?\n Once they get to know you, they\u0027ll think you\u0027re really cool.\"\n \"Yeah,\" Tally said softly. \"Everyone\u0027s been really nice.\" She wished she had activated the pendant the moment she\u0027d gotten there. In only one day she\u0027d begun to realize that it wasn\u0027t just Shay\u0027s dream she\u0027d be betraying. Hundreds of people had made a life in the Smoke.\n \"And I\u0027m sure your someone will be cool too,\" Shay said. \"I can\u0027t wait till we\u0027re all together.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know if...that\u0027s going to happen.\" There had to be some other way out of this situation. Maybe if she went to another city...or found the rangers again and told them that she wanted to volunteer, they\u0027d make her pretty. But she hardly knew anything about their city, except that she didn\u0027t know anyone there....\n Shay shrugged. \"Maybe not. But I wasn\u0027t sure you\u0027d come either.\" She squeezed Tally\u0027s hand. \"I\u0027m really glad you did, though.\"\n Tally tried to smile. \"Even though I got you into trouble?\"\n \"It\u0027s not such a big deal. I think everyone\u0027s way too paranoid around here. They spend all this time disguising the place so satellites can\u0027t see it, and they mask the handphone transmissions so they won\u0027t be intercepted. And all the secrecy about runaways is way overdone. And dangerous. Just think - if you hadn\u0027t been smart enough to figure out my directions, you could be halfway to Alaska by now!\"\n \"I don\u0027t know, Shay. Maybe they know what they\u0027re doing. The city authorities can be pretty tough.\"\n Shay laughed. \"Don\u0027t tell me you believe in Special Circumstances.\"\n \"I...\" Tally closed her eyes. \"I just think that the Smokies have to be careful.\"\n \"Okay, sure. I\u0027m not saying we should advertise. But if people like you and me want to come out here and live differently, why shouldn\u0027t we? I mean, no one has the right to tell us we have to be pretty, right?\"\n \"Maybe they\u0027re just worried because we\u0027re kids. You know?\"\n \"That\u0027s the problem with the cities, Tally. Everyone\u0027s a kid, pampered and dependent and pretty. Just like they say in school: Big-eyed means vulnerable. Well, like you once told me, you have to grow up sometime.\"\n Tally nodded. \"I know what you mean, how the uglies here are more grown up. You can see it in their faces.\"\n Shay pulled Tally to a stop and looked at her closely for a second. \"You feel guilty, don\u0027t you?\"\n Tally looked back into Shay\u0027s eyes, speechless for a moment. She suddenly felt naked in the cold night air, as if Shay could see straight through her lies.\n \"What?\" she managed.\n \"Guilty. Not just that you told your someone about the Smoke, but that they might actually come. Now that you\u0027ve seen the Smoke, you\u0027re not sure if that was such a good idea.\" Shay sighed. \"I know it seems weird at first, and it\u0027s a lot of hard work. But I think you\u0027ll eventually like it.\"\n Tally looked down, feeling tears welling into her eyes. \"It\u0027s not that. Well, maybe it is. I just don\u0027t know if I can...\" Her throat felt too full to speak. If she said another word, she\u0027d have to tell Shay the truth: that she was a spy, a traitor sent there to destroy everything around them.\n And that Shay was the fool who had led her there.\n \"Hey, it\u0027s okay.\" Shay gathered Tally in her arms, rocking her gently as Tally began to cry. \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to unload everything on you at once. But I\u0027ve felt kind of distant from you since you got here. It feels like you\u0027re not sure you want to look at me.\"\n \"I should tell you everything.\"\n \"Shhh.\" Tally felt Shay\u0027s fingers stroking her hair. \"I\u0027m just glad you\u0027re here.\"\n Tally let herself cry, burying her face in the scratchy wool sleeve of her new sweater, feeling Shay\u0027s warmth against her, and feeling awful about every gesture of kindness from her friend.\n With half her mind, Tally was actually glad she\u0027d come and seen all this. She could have lived her whole life in the city and never seen this much of the world. With the other half, Tally still wished she had activated the pendant the moment she\u0027d arrived in the Smoke. It would have been so much easier that way.\n But there was no way back in time now. She had to decide whether to betray the Smoke or not, completely understanding what it would do to Shay, to David, to everyone here.\n \"It\u0027s okay, Tally,\" Shay murmured. \"You\u0027ll be okay.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/uglies-uglies-1/page-27.html","bookId":1573,"book":{"id":1573,"title":"Uglies (Uglies #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Uglies (Uglies #1) \n Tally Youngblood is about to turn sixteen, and she can\u0027t wait for the operation that turns everyone from a repellent ugly into a stunningly attractive pretty and catapults you into a high-tech paradise where your only job is to party.
