He had no intention of stopping anyplace in that claustrophobic tunnel, not after that first unnerving break. The other boys weren’t likely to give him his seat back, and besides—who knew? What if the cart broke, or they couldn’t get it moving again? What if the track was uneven, or imperfectly maintained, and the wheels refused to run against it without their hard-earned momentum?\\n\\n The rail line split, just as Houjin said it would. It veered to the right, and soon after, to the left. The grade steepened, the pump handles stiffened, and the way became harder. Sweating and grunting, the trio forced the cart forward, shoving it up the incline.\\n\\n Just when Rector was dead certain he’d have to stop cranking or his arms would fall off, the darkness shifted up ahead and he could see the end reflected in the other boys’ visors.\\n\\n Before too long they drew up to an open area with lights bolted onto the walls. Some of these lights were lit, but most were out. Even so, it gave the space enough illumination for Rector to find it encouraging.\\n\\n Houjin squeezed the brake and the wheels squealed outrageously, sparks spit from the metal-on-metal connection, and the cart came to a halt. All three of its occupants leaned, jerked, and sat up straight with their bones still rattling. They crawled out and gathered their belongings.\\n\\n Zeke went behind the cart and kicked a triangle-shaped block, which dropped down against the wheel. “Keeps it from rolling when it’s parked,” he explained when he saw that he was being watched. “’Cause I don’t feel like chasing it down later on. Come on. Let’s hit the bridges.”\\n\\n They came up through the basement of an old livery stable that still had decomposing leather tack hanging on the walls. The bones of horses or dogs or maybe even men and women lay scattered about like a child’s game of sticks; the boys avoided them as best they were able, but every so often the room rang out with the loud, cracking pop of something that once was alive.\\n\\n The livery was only a story and a half tall, and above street level the windows had been left unboarded, allowing a watery wash of that feeble gray sun to spill inside. Rector turned his lantern down, then off. “Won’t be needing it, will I?” he asked too late, but Houjin shook his head.\\n\\n “No, we’ll be on the roof soon.”\\n\\n “Will that be high enough? I only see the loft, and the ladder. Everything else we climbed the other day … all of them buildings were taller than this one.”\\n\\n “Different part of town,” Zeke said. “Trust me, though. Any roof that’ll hold us will keep us out of reach. And we’ll be right up against the main wall, most of the way.”\\n\\n Rector frowned and scratched at the straps that held his mask in place. He didn’t get a lot of traction, since he was wearing Fang’s gloves, but it’d only been an idle gesture anyway. “So the wall went up smack in the middle of some buildings, right?”\\n\\n Houjin replied, “Right. Cut some of them in two.”\\n\\n “But not all the way around, I wouldn’t think.”\\n\\n Zeke shook his head. “No, not all the way around. Why? What are you getting at?”\\n\\n “Once we get out to the wall’s edge, how do we investigate without getting down within … you know … grabbing reach?”\\n\\n “We don’t,” Houjin said simply.\\n\\n “Then how do we avoid the rotters? The ones we’re technically looking for, I mean.”\\n\\n “We avoid them the same way we find them,” he said offhandedly. “By listening.”\\n\\n “What do we do if we find some, and we can’t climb up out of their reach?”\\n\\n Zeke said, “We run like hell, that’s what we do. Unless you’re packing a pistol somewhere in that satchel, and I bet you’re not.”\\n\\n “I’m not,” Rector admitted, mentally adding it to his wish list. A gun of some sort seemed to be the obvious means of survival inside the walled city. “And neither of you two have one either, do you?”\\n\\n “Naw. Guns are so loud, it just attracts more of them. Once we get up to the roof, you’ll see what we use to take care of them.” Zeke led the way up a long flight of stairs that led to a trapdoor. He flipped it open and a puff of swirling Blight gas billowed down into the livery, dousing Rector and Houjin. They wiped at their visors out of habit or reflex. It didn’t help.\\n\\n Houjin ran up the steps behind Zeke, and Rector came after.\\n\\n On the roof, a row of storage trunks were lined up along the western edge. These trunks did not match and had never been part of a single person’s luggage set, but they were large and sturdy, and Rector thought he saw Union army markings on one of them. Footlockers, then—that’s what they were. Well, footlockers and a couple of steamers.\\n\\n “What’s all this?” he asked.\\n\\n Zeke went to the farthest left one and popped the latch. Houjin did the same to the one beside him.\\n\\n As Zeke rummaged through the contents, he explained, “The Doornails keep the far corners stocked in case somebody gets stranded. You never know when you’ll meet rotters, or when you’ll fall through something that ain’t as solid as it looks,” he added, and Houjin jabbed him with an elbow. “It’s easy to get hurt out here, or stuck.”\\n\\n “That’s smart,” Rector said approvingly. “So what do we have here—food? Filters? Lanterns and such? If you knew this was here, why’d we bring so much fuel?”\\n\\n Houjin answered that one. “In case we didn’t make it this far. The whole underground works that way—everyone survives by preparing for just in case.”\\n\\n “Sounds like a lot of trouble.”\\n\\n “It is a lot of trouble,” Zeke agreed. “But look at this, would you?” He hoisted aloft a long ax that was once painted red, now more rusty than scarlet. It looked solid and dangerous. It also looked almost too heavy for Zeke to hold, much less wield.\\n\\n “What’s that, an old fireman’s piece?”\\n\\n Zeke nodded. “Probably. And it’ll take a rotter’s head in two, just like that—” He swung for demonstration, and Houjin deftly stepped out of the way as if he’d been part of this particular charade before. “There’s more in here, axes and even some cavalry swords, but I’m not sure I’d recommend one of those.”\\n\\n “Why not?”\\n\\n “The metal’s too thin; it’s getting brittle. We need to seal these trunks better,” Houjin complained. “Blight gets into everything.”\\n\\n “So what do you recommend?” Rector asked. He stood between Zeke and Houjin and stared down into the trunks they’d opened. He saw another couple of axes; some big saws that had been refitted with longer handles (Must be awkward, he thought); a few clubs, some metal and some wood; an assortment of mining tools such as picks and hammers; and a handful of things that might’ve been smithing tools.\\n\\n The boys indulged in a brief discussion of the pros and cons of each, and Rector selected an oversized miner’s pick. He tossed it from palm to palm and spun it around his elbow.\\n\\n “This’ll work, I think.”\\n\\n Zeke closed his trunk. “All you need to know is, if you see a rotter, you run. Only start swinging if you can’t outrun ’em. You don’t want them to bite you, that’s for damn sure.”\\n\\n “Of course I don’t want them to bite me.”\\n\\n Houjin shut his trunk, too, and slung a sharpened metal bar over his shoulder. “No, you don’t understand: Their bites fester. Whatever they bite, you have to cut off.”\\n\\n Rector was glad for the gas mask—he didn’t want the other boys to see him go green around the edges. He gulped, sniffed, and coolly said, “I’ve heard that before, and I’ll take it into consideration. Say, what’s that you’re carrying, Huey?”\\n\\n Huey turned the bar in his hand, twirling it like a baton, but more slowly. It was over three feet long, and appeared to be cast iron. “It was for wagon wheels, I think. To pry them on and off. I like it. It’s a good size and a good weight, and I can stab with it”—which he demonstrated—“or hack with it,” he showed, by jerking it from side to side.\\n\\n “Or just beat somebody to death,” Rector observed.\\n\\n “True.” Again he rested it on his shoulder. “But you have better luck stopping rotters if you can smash their brains or knock their heads off. Go in through an eye socket, if you’ve got the aim to hit it. Or hack at their necks, if that’s an easier target.”\\n\\n “Jesus.”\\n\\n “It sounds harder than it really is. Most of the rotters inside the city have been here for years, and they’re starting to get mushy.”\\n\\n Zeke chimed in. “And most of them don’t run very fast.”\\n\\n Rector held the pickax and looked over the side of the roof. “This is a god-awful way to get around your own neighborhood. And you two talk like it’s just an everyday thing, hacking people up and putting bars through their eyeballs.”\\n\\n Houjin muttered, “Don’t like it, don’t have to stay here.”\\n\\n “I’ll get used to it,” Rector countered.\\n\\n He hefted the pickax and followed him over to the roof’s eastern edge, where a drawbridge was laid out flat and ready. It groaned beneath their feet, and small splinters of old paint and decaying wood went dusting down to the dangerous, deserted streets below as they crossed.\\n\\n Fourteen\\n\\n They walked single file through more windows turned into doors, navigating along balconies and over storefronts for eight blocks until they were forced to drop to the ground and sprint across one street and down into a storm cellar. Then they went up through an empty grocer’s, scaled more stairs, and emerged on another roof, only to trip lightly down another long bridge made of doors.\\n\\n These makeshift devices swayed under their feet enough that more than once the boys agreed to cross one at a time, so as to not strain the walkway.\\n\\n Finally they ran out of structures; there were no more roofs or bridges to hold them aloft. Without a word, they scooted down an old iron ladder that had once been part of a fire escape. Its rusted bolts creaked, and as they descended foot by foot, hand by hand, brick dust rained down onto the dead grass and cracked streets below. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-inexplicables-the-clockwork-century-4/page-26.html","bookId":1670,"book":{"id":1670,"title":"The Inexplicables (The Clockwork Century #4)","description":"Storyline: The Inexplicables (The Clockwork Century #4) \\n Rector “Wreck ’em” Sherman was orphaned as a toddler in the Blight of 1863, but that was years ago. Wreck has grown up, and on his eighteenth birthday, he’ll be cast out out of the orphanage. \\n And Wreck’s problems aren’t merely about finding a home. He’s been quietly breaking the cardinal rule of any good drug dealer and dipping into his own supply of the sap he sells. He’s also pretty sure he’s being haunted by the ghost of a kid he used to know—Zeke Wilkes, who almost certainly died six months ago. Zeke would have every reason to pester Wreck, since Wreck got him inside the walled city of Seattle in the first place, and that was probably what killed him. Maybe it’s only a guilty conscience, but Wreck can’t take it anymore, so he sneaks over the wall. \\n The walled-off wasteland of Seattle is every bit as bad as he’d heard, chock-full of the hungry undead and utterly choked by the poisonous, inescapable yellow gas. And then there\u0027s the monster. Rector\u0027s pretty certain that whatever attacked him was not at all human—and not a rotter, either. Arms far too long. Posture all strange. Eyes all wild and faintly glowing gold and known to the locals as simply “The Inexplicables.” \\n In the process of tracking down these creatures, Rector comes across another incursion through the wall -- just as bizarre but entirely attributable to human greed. It seems some outsiders have decided there’s gold to be found in the city and they’re willing to do whatever it takes to get a piece of the pie unless Rector and his posse have anything to do with it.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-inexplicables-the-clockwork-century-4.jpg","author":"Cherie Priest","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-inexplicables-the-clockwork-century-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:51 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:16:10 PM"}}
