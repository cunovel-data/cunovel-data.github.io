No man on earth had a right to look this good. Refusing him would have required more effort than she could possibly muster. Oh, yes, she wanted to dance with him. Wanted to slide into his arms, be held by him… Rather than attempt to respond verbally—at the rate she was going she hadn’t a clue what might actually come out of her mouth—she nodded and put her wineglass on a nearby table. Seth led her onto the dance floor and turned her into his embrace. Naturally—fittingly—the band was playing a slow dance and she lifted her arms as he held her loosely. Justine was amazed at how well-suited they were physically. At five-ten and in heels, she was taller than most of the men, but Seth still had several inches on her. She rested her head against his shoulder and breathed in his clean, outdoor scent. This was the first time she’d ever danced with him. “You came alone?” he whispered. “Yes.” The music was mesmerizing and it was all she could do not to close her eyes and give herself completely over to it. That couldn’t happen, especially with Seth. She couldn’t allow herself to be trapped in the magic of the moment. She refused to let her guard down, certain that as soon as she did, Seth would ask her about Warren, or the engagement. “I did, too,” he said after a minute. “Came here alone, I mean.” He wrapped his hand around hers and brought it to his chest. Justine felt the solid, steady beat of his heart. It seemed to travel through her hand and the pulse in her wrist, directly to her own heart. His eyes held her, and with their steps in unison, this was the most sensual, seductive moment of her life. When the love song ended, Seth released her. She moved away from him and clapped politely. “Do you have a table yet?” Seth asked. “Lana asked me to sit with her and Jay.” “Well, Jay invited me to sit with him and Lana,” Seth told her, eyes twinkling. So the Rothchilds were involved in a little matchmaking. Just now, it was very easy to forgive them. “The buffet isn’t until nine.” “I know,” she said, wondering if he was inviting her to dance again. If so, he didn’t need to ask. When the music started, they moved toward each other as though magnetically drawn. Other than the few times they stopped to talk to friends, Justine and Seth danced every dance. Soon the buffet table was ready and a line of revelers straggled around the gym floor. Seth bought them each a glass of wine and sat next to her at the table for eight. It wasn’t long before Justine fell into conversation with the others. Soon pictures of her classmates’ children were passed around and she found herself looking at the cherubic faces and listening to stories full of love and pride. Justine carried a small photograph of her newborn niece and showed it to Seth. “James is married? When did this happen?” “Earlier in the year. Isn’t Isabella beautiful?” Justine had made a firm decision not to be a mother, but as she studied the photographs she was handed, she felt an intense and unexpected longing. It would eventually pass; she recognized that, even as she struggled to deal with a slew of unwelcome emotions. “Excuse me,” she said, getting to her feet. Instead of heading for the ladies’ room, Justine walked outside, out the front door, letting the cool air revive her. She leaned against the flagpole and closed her eyes, breathing in the night air and with it the return of her rational self. She wasn’t like those people back inside the school. She never had been. She was separate, different. Not above them, just not one of them. She’d known it in high school and felt it even more profoundly ten years out. “Justine?” Seth joined her. “Is something wrong?” “No.” She was quick to assure him that everything was fine, but he wasn’t fooled. “What is it?” She shook her head. She couldn’t explain to Seth, of all people, that she’d come outside in order to clear her head and put her life back in perspective. “You look like you’re about to cry,” Seth commented. “That’s ridiculous.” She turned away, but Seth caught her hand and drew her gently into his arms. She could have resisted at any time—but didn’t. She knew he intended to kiss her even before his lips claimed hers. This wasn’t their first kiss, but Justine had conveniently forgotten what this man was capable of doing to her resolve. The effect of his kisses was like putting a match to lighter fluid, each one hotter and more explosive. “This isn’t a good idea,” Justine cried, tearing her mouth from his, her breathing labored. “It’s a terrible idea,” Seth agreed, but it was clear he was teasing her as he brought his mouth to hers. He held her head between his hands, but Justine wasn’t struggling. She submitted fully to the kiss, starved for his touch. “We have to stop,” she whimpered. “The reunion…” he murmured. “Yes…yes, we should get back.” Justine broke away and hid her face against his collarbone as her shoulders heaved. Seth held still, arms around her waist, until his ragged breathing slowed. “This really isn’t a good idea,” Justine finally said, and broke free from Seth entirely. “Why isn’t it?” “You aren’t going to like the answer,” she told him. “What?” he asked. “I suppose you’re going to say you’ve decided to accept Warren’s proposal, after all?” She attempted a smile, one that would show him she was confident in her decision. “Actually, I have.” “You’re going to marry Warren Saget?” The question sounded incredulous. She lowered her eyes and nodded. Seth didn’t say anything for several seconds, then exhaled slowly. “If that’s your choice, I’m obliged to honor it. I only want the best for you, and if that’s Warren as your husband…I won’t try to change your mind.” He spun on his heel and returned to the reunion alone. Dan had been missing for over three months now, and as the weeks drifted by, Grace had become almost accustomed to living alone. She’d adopted a routine of sorts, which helped her forget that the man she’d been married to all those years had abandoned her and their two daughters. She couldn’t understand why he hadn’t stayed long enough to see their first grandchild. Kelly had convinced herself that her father would be back before the baby was born, but Grace held out no such hope. Roy McAfee continued to give her biweekly updates on his progress, but so far he had nothing of significance to report. There’d been no more sightings of Dan in town after that one time. Grace suspected there wouldn’t be. Her husband had come to deliver a message and Grace had received it loud and clear. He hadn’t been to the house again, either. Thursday evening after she’d closed the library for the night, Grace walked toward her car, which she’d left near Waterfront Park. Concert on the Cove—a summertime music series sponsored by the downtown merchants—was on tonight. This was exactly the kind of social gathering Dan hated; in all the years the performances had been offered, Grace hadn’t attended a single one. Families came with their children, senior citizens brought their own chairs, teenagers hung out in groups. Most people brought a take-out dinner. The blend of young and old drew the community together. As she reached her car, Grace heard sixties rock-and-roll and sang along with an old Diana Ross hit. All at once it dawned on her that there was nothing to keep her away. There hadn’t really been a good reason in the past, and there wasn’t now. Dan would never have told her she couldn’t attend, but she hadn’t wanted to go alone. She was alone now, with no reason to hurry home. She could stay or leave as she wished; it was entirely up to her. How odd that this insight should give her such a profound sense of freedom. It felt as if shackles had been unlocked and the weight she’d carried had fallen from her shoulders. She was free—free to attend the concert. Free to enjoy life without catering to Dan’s likes and dislikes. Free to do what she wanted. Walking over to the park, Grace stopped long enough to pick up an order of chicken teriyaki from the Japanese restaurant across the street. Most of the seating had already been taken. Grace stood and watched, delighting in the fact that so many people were enjoying the concert. A trio of women cavorted on the bandstand. Dressed in miniskirts, pageboy haircuts and pink feather boas, The Blondells performed the old Supremes hits from the ‘60s, and Grace found herself smiling at their energy and high-spirited fun. “Grace!” Charlotte Jefferson raised her arm in order to attract Grace’s attention. Her best friend’s mother sat on the outer edge of a semi-circle of lawn chairs, with a blanket spread in front of her. Grace made her way over to Charlotte, maneuvering slowly through the crowd. “Sit here with me,” Charlotte invited. “I have something I want to discuss with you later, all right?” “Sure.” Grateful for the invitation, Grace sat down on the blanket and leaned against one leg of Charlotte’s chair. Her back would start to ache soon, but she would enjoy this as long as she could. “This is such good music,” Charlotte announced when the intermission was announced. “It’s fabulous,” Grace agreed. “You know, I was just thinking of you the other day,” Charlotte said. “I have something for you.” “Me?” “I talked it over with Olivia, and she thinks it’s a good idea. Exactly what you needed, she said.” Grace was intrigued. “A friend of mine, a good friend, has a wonderful companion, and well, she’s moving to a retirement complex and needs to find a home for Buttercup.” “Buttercup?” “Harry’s been such a loyal friend, and seeing that you’re alone, I thought…” Charlotte looked uncertain. “I did plan to ask you first, but as I recall you’ve had dogs in the past.” Dan had loved his dogs, and throughout their marriage they’d had a number of family pets. Two years ago, their small cocker mix had died peacefully in his sleep and Dan had decided they wouldn’t have any more animals. “What kind of dog is Buttercup?” she asked. “A golden retriever.” “I’d love a dog,” Grace said decisively. “I really would.” Charlotte rubbed her hands together. “I’m so pleased. Olga’s been terribly worried about finding a good home for her dog. I knew you were the right person.” “I’d be happy to take Buttercup over to visit Olga now and then, if that would put her mind at ease.” “Oh, Grace, what a thoughtful gesture. Olga would be so appreciative.” That weekend, the golden retriever became part of Grace’s life. She wasn’t sure how well the dog would adapt to a new environment, but the moment Grace brought her into the house, it was as if Buttercup recognized it as her home and prepared to settle in.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/16-lighthouse-road-cedar-cove-1/page-44.html","bookId":1941,"book":{"id":1941,"title":"16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove #1)","description":"Storyline: 16 Lighthouse Road (Cedar Cove #1) Olivia Lockhart 16 Lighthouse Road Cedar Cove, Washington Dear Reader, You don\u0027t know me yet, but in a few hours that\u0027s going to change.
