You see, I\u0027m inviting you to my home and my town of Cedar Cove because I want ou to meet my family, friends, and neighbors. Come and hear their stories - maybe even their secrets! I have to admit that my own secrets are pretty open. My marriage failed some years ago, and I have a rather ... difficult relationship with my daughter, Justine. Then there\u0027s my mother, Charlotte, who has plenty of opinions and is always willing to share them. Here\u0027s an example: I\u0027m a family court judge and she likes to drop in on my courtroom. Recently I was hearing a divorce petition. In Charlotte\u0027s view, young Cecilia and Ian Randall hadn\u0027t tried hard enough to make their marriage work - and I agreed. So I rendered my judgement: Divorce Denied. Well, you wouldn\u0027t believe the reaction! Thanks to an article by Jack Griffin, the editor of our local paper (and a man I wouldn\u0027t mind seeing more of!), everyone\u0027s talking. Cedar Cove - people love it and sometimes they leave it, but they never forget it! See you soon ...
