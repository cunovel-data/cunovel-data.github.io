You see, I\u0027m inviting you to my home and my town of Cedar Cove because I want ou to meet my family, friends, and neighbors. Come and hear their stories - maybe even their secrets! \n I have to admit that my own secrets are pretty open. My marriage failed some years ago, and I have a rather ... difficult relationship with my daughter, Justine. Then there\u0027s my mother, Charlotte, who has plenty of opinions and is always willing to share them. \n Here\u0027s an example: I\u0027m a family court judge and she likes to drop in on my courtroom. Recently I was hearing a divorce petition. In Charlotte\u0027s view, young Cecilia and Ian Randall hadn\u0027t tried hard enough to make their marriage work - and I agreed. So I rendered my judgement: Divorce Denied. \n Well, you wouldn\u0027t believe the reaction! Thanks to an article by Jack Griffin, the editor of our local paper (and a man I wouldn\u0027t mind seeing more of!), everyone\u0027s talking. \n Cedar Cove - people love it and sometimes they leave it, but they never forget it! \n See you soon ... \n Olivia\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/16-lighthouse-road-cedar-cove-1.jpg","author":"Debbie Macomber","type":"Romance","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":49,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Romance","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
