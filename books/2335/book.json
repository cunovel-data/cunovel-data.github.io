When Scudder\u0027s childhood friend Jack Ellery is murdered, presumably while attempting to atone for past sins, Scudder reluctantly begins his own investigation, with just one lead: Ellery\u0027s Alcoholics Anonymous list of people he wronged. One of them may be a killer, but that\u0027s not necessarily Scudder\u0027s greatest danger. Immersing himself in Ellery\u0027s world may lead him right back to the bar stool. \n In a novel widely celebrated by critics and readers, Lawrence Block circle back to how it all began, reestablishing the Matthew Scudder series as one of the pinnacles of American detective fiction.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-drop-of-the-hard-stuff-matthew-scudder-17.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":48,"category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
