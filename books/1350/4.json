{"id":20889,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV.","content":"NINE TIMES NINE IS EIGHTY-ONE. SHOWING HOW BROWN, JONES, AND ROBINSON SELECTED THEIR HOUSE OF BUSINESS. And haberdashery it was. But there was much yet to be done before any terms for a partnership could be settled. Mr. Jones at first insisted that he and his father-in-law should begin business on equal terms. He considered that any questions as to the actual right in the property would be mean after their mutual agreement to start in the world as friends. But to this Mr. Brown, not unnaturally, objected. \"Then I shall go back to my lawyer,\" said Jones. Whereupon he did leave the room, taking his hat with him; but he remained below in the old shop. \"If I am to go into partnership with that man alone,\" said Mr. Brown, turning to his young friend almost in despair, \"I may prepare for the Gazette at once.—And for my grave!\" he added, solemnly. \"I\u0027ll join you,\" said Robinson. \"I haven\u0027t got any money. You know that. But then neither has he.\" \"I wish you had a little,\" said Mr. Brown. \"Capital is capital, you know.\" \"But I\u0027ve got that which is better than capital,\" said Robinson, touching his forehead with his forefinger. \"And if you\u0027ll trust me, Mr. Brown, I won\u0027t see you put upon.\" The promise which Mr. Robinson then gave he kept ever afterwards with a marked fidelity. \"I will trust you,\" said Mr. Brown. \"It shall be Brown, Jones, and Robinson.\" \"And Brown, Jones, and Robinson shall carry their heads high among the greatest commercial firms of this wealthy metropolis,\" said Robinson, with an enthusiasm which was surely pardonable at such a moment. Mr. Jones soon returned with another compromise; but it was of a low, peddling nature. It had reference to sevenths and eighths, and went into the payments of the household bills. \"I, as one of the partners, must object to any such arrangements,\" said Robinson. \"You!—you one of the partners!\" said Jones. \"If you have no objection—certainly!\" said Robinson. \"And if you should have any objection,—equally so.\" \"You!—a bill-sticker!\" said Jones. In the presence of William Brisket, George Robinson had been forced to acknowledge that matter must still occasionally prevail over mind; but he felt no such necessity in the presence of Jones. \"I\u0027ll tell you what it is,\" said Robinson; \"I\u0027ve never denied my former calling. Among friends I often talk about it. But mind you, Mr. Jones, I won\u0027t bear it from you! I\u0027m not very big myself, but I think I could stand up before you!\" But in this quarrel they were stopped by Mr. Brown. \"Let dogs delight,\" he said or sung, \"to bark and bite;—\" and then he raised his two fat hands feebly, as though deprecating any further wrath. As usual on such occasions Mr. Robinson yielded, and then explained in very concise language the terms on which it was proposed that the partnership should be opened. Mr. Brown should put his \"capital\" into the business, and be entitled to half the profits. Mr. Jones and Mr. Robinson should give the firm the advantage of their youth, energies, and genius, and should each be held as the possessor of a quarter. That Mr. Jones made long and fierce objections to this, need hardly be stated. It is believed that he did, more than once, go back to his lawyer. But Mr. Brown, who, for the time, put himself into the hands of his youngest partner, remained firm, and at last the preliminaries were settled. The name of the house, the nature of the business, and the shares of the partners were now settled, and the site of the future labours of the firm became the next question. Mr. Brown was in favour of a small tenement in Little Britain, near to the entrance into Smithfield. \"There would not be scope there,\" said Robinson. \"And no fashion,\" said Jones. \"It\u0027s safe and respectable,\" pleaded Mr. Brown. \"There have been shops in Little Britain these sixty years in the same families.\" But Robinson was of opinion that the fortunes of the firm might not improbably be made in six, if only they would commence with sufficient distinction. He had ascertained that large and commanding premises might be had in St. Paul\u0027s Churchyard, in the frontage of which the square feet of plate glass could be counted by the hundred. It was true that the shop was nearly all window; but then, as Mr. Robinson said, an extended front of glass was the one thing necessary. And it was true also that the future tenants must pay down a thousand pounds before they entered;—but then, as he explained, how could they better expend the trifle of money which they possessed? \"Trifle of money!\" said Mr. Brown, thinking of the mountains of butter and years of economy which had been required to put together those four thousand pounds;—thinking also, perhaps, of the absolute impecuniosity of his young partner who thus spoke. Jones was for the West End and Regent Street. There was a shop only two doors off Regent Street, which could be made to look as if it was almost in Regent Street. The extension of a side piece of plate glass would show quite into Regent Street. He even prepared a card, describing the house as \"2 doors from Regent Street,\" printing the figure and the words \"Regent Street\" very large, and the intermediate description very small. It was ever by such stale, inefficient artifices as these that he sought success. \"Who\u0027ll care for your card?\" said Robinson. \"When a man\u0027s card comes to be of use to him, the thing\u0027s done. He\u0027s living in his villa by that time, and has his five thousand a-year out of the profits.\" \"I hope you\u0027ll both have your willas before long,\" said Brown, trying to keep his partners in good humour. \"But a cottage horney will be enough for me. I\u0027d like to be able to give my children their bit of dinner on Sunday hot and comfortable. I want no more than that.\" That was a hard battle, and it resulted in no victory. The dingy shop in Little Britain was, of course, out of the question; and Mr. Brown assisted Robinson in preventing that insane attempt at aping the unprofitable glories of Regent Street. The matter ended in another compromise, and a house was taken in Bishopsgate Street, of which the frontage was extensive and commanding, but as to which it must certainly be confessed that the back part of the premises was inconveniently confined. \"It isn\u0027t exactly all I could wish,\" said Robinson, standing on the pavement as he surveyed it. \"But it will do. With a little originality and some dash, we\u0027ll make it do. We must give it a name.\" \"A name?\" said Mr. Brown; \"it\u0027s 81, Bishopsgate Street; ain\u0027t it? They don\u0027t call houses names in London.\" \"That\u0027s just why we\u0027ll have a name for ours, Mr. Brown.\" \"The \u0027Albert Emporium,\u0027\" suggested Jones; \"or \u0027Victoria Mart.\u0027\" Mr. Jones, as will be seen, was given to tuft-hunting to the backbone. His great ambition was to have a lion and unicorn, and to call himself haberdasher to a royal prince. He had never realized the fact that profit, like power, comes from the people, and not from the court. \"I wouldn\u0027t put up the Queen\u0027s arms if the Queen came and asked me,\" Robinson once said in answer to him. \"That game has been played out, and it isn\u0027t worth the cost of the two wooden figures.\" \"\u0027The Temple of Fashion\u0027 would do very well,\" said Jones. \"The Temple of Fiddlestick!\" said Robinson. \"Of course you say so,\" said Jones. \"Let dogs delight—\" began Mr. Brown, standing as we were in the middle of the street. \"I\u0027ll tell you what,\" said Robinson; \"there\u0027s nothing like colour. We\u0027ll call it Magenta House, and we\u0027ll paint it magenta from the roof to the window tops.\" This beautiful tint had only then been invented, and it was necessary to explain the word to Mr. Brown. He merely remarked that the oil and paint would come to a deal of money, and then gave way. Jones was struck dumb by the brilliancy of the idea, and for once forgot to object. \"And, I\u0027ll tell you what,\" said Robinson—\"nine times nine is eighty-one.\" \"Certainly, certainly,\" said Mr. Brown, who delighted to agree with his younger partner when circumstances admitted it. \"You are right there, certainly.\" Jones was observed to go through the multiplication table mentally, but he could detect no error. \"Nine times nine is eighty-one,\" repeated Robinson with confidence, \"and we\u0027ll put that fact up over the first-floor windows.\" And so they did. The house was painted magenta colour from top to bottom. And on the front in very large figures and letters, was stated the undoubted fact that nine times nine is 81. \"If they will only call us \u0027The nine times nine,\u0027 the thing is done,\" said Robinson. Nevertheless, the house was christened Magenta House. \"And now about glass,\" said Robinson, when the three had retired to the little back room within. Mr. Robinson, however, admitted afterwards that he was wrong about the colour and the number. Such methods of obtaining attention were, he said, too easy of imitation, and devoid of any inherent attraction of their own. People would not care for nine times nine in Bishopsgate Street, if there were nine times nines in other streets as well. \"No,\" said he; \"I was but beginning, and made errors as beginners do. Outside there should be glass, gas, gold, and glare. Inside there should be the same, with plenty of brass, and if possible a little wit. If those won\u0027t do it, nothing will.\" All the same the magenta colour and the nine times nine did have their effect. \"Nine times nine is eighty-one,\" was printed on the top of all the flying advertisements issued by the firm, and the printing was all done in magenta. Mr. Brown groaned sorely over the expenditure that was necessary in preparation of the premises. His wish was that this should be paid for in ready money; and indeed it was necessary that this should be done to a certain extent. But the great object should have been to retain every available shilling for advertisements. In the way of absolute capital,—money to be paid for stock,—4,000l. was nothing. But 4,000l. scattered broadcast through the metropolis on walls, omnibuses, railway stations, little books, pavement chalkings, illuminated notices, porters\u0027 backs, gilded cars, and men in armour, would have driven nine times nine into the memory of half the inhabitants of London. The men in armour were tried. Four suits were obtained in Poland Street, and four strong men were hired who rode about town all day on four brewers\u0027 horses. They carried poles with large banners, and on the banners were inscribed the words which formed the shibboleth of the firm;— MAGENTA HOUSE, 9 TIMES 9 IS 81, BISHOPSGATE STREET. And four times a day these four men in armour met each other in front of the windows of the house, and stood there on horseback for fifteen minutes, with their backs to the curbstone. The forage, however, of the horses became so terribly large an item of expenditure that Mr. Brown\u0027s heart failed him. His heart failed him, and he himself went off late one evening to the livery stable-keeper who supplied the horses, and in Mr. Robinson\u0027s absence, the armour was sent back to Poland Street. \"We should have had the police down upon us, George,\" said Mr. Brown, deprecating the anger of his younger partner. \"And what better advertisement could you have wished?\" said Robinson. \"It would have been in all the papers, and have cost nothing.\" \"But you don\u0027t know, George, what them beastesses was eating! It was frightful to hear of! Four-and-twenty pounds of corn a day each of \u0027em, because the armour was so uncommon heavy.\" The men in armour were then given up, but they certainly were beginning to be effective. At 6 p.m., when the men were there, it had become impossible to pass the shop without going into the middle of the street, and on one or two occasions the policemen had spoken to Mr. Brown. Then there was a slight accident with a child, and the newspapers had interfered. But we are anticipating the story, for the men in armour did not begin their operations till the shop had been opened. \"And now about glass,\" said Robinson, as soon as the three partners had retired from the outside flags into the interior of the house. \"It must be plate, of course,\" said Jones. Plate! He might as well have said when wanting a house, that it must have walls. \"I rather think so,\" said Robinson; \"and a good deal of it.\" \"I don\u0027t mind a good-sized common window,\" said Brown. \"A deal better have them uncommon,\" said Robinson, interrupting him. \"And remember, sir, there\u0027s nothing like glass in these days. It has superseded leather altogether in that respect.\" \"Leather!\" said Mr. Brown, who was hardly quick enough for his junior partner. \"Of all our materials now in general use,\" said Robinson, \"glass is the most brilliant, and yet the cheapest; the most graceful and yet the strongest. Though transparent it is impervious to wet. The eye travels through it, but not the hailstorm. To the power of gas it affords no obstacle, but is as efficient a barrier against the casualties of the street as an iron shutter. To that which is ordinary it lends a grace; and to that which is graceful it gives a double lustre. Like a good advertisement, it multiplies your stock tenfold, and like a good servant, it is always eloquent in praise of its owner. I look upon plate glass, sir, as the most glorious product of the age; and I regard the tradesman who can surround himself with the greatest quantity of it, as the most in advance of the tradesmen of his day. Oh, sir, whatever we do, let us have glass.\" \"It\u0027s beautiful to hear him talk,\" said Mr. Brown; \"but it\u0027s the bill I\u0027m a thinking of.\" \"If you will only go enough ahead, Mr. Brown, you\u0027ll find that nobody will trouble you with such bills.\" \"But they must be paid some day, George.\" \"Of course they must; but it will never do to think of that now. In twelve months or so, when we have set the house well going, the payment of such bills as that will be a mere nothing,—a thing that will be passed as an item not worth notice. Faint heart never won fair lady, you know, Mr. Brown.\" And then a cloud came across George Robinson\u0027s brow as he thought of the words he had spoken; for his heart had once been faint, and his fair lady was by no means won. \"That\u0027s quite true,\" said Jones; \"it never does. Ha! ha! ha!\" Then the cloud went away from George Robinson\u0027s brow, and a stern frown of settled resolution took its place. At that moment he made up his mind, that when he might again meet that giant butcher he would forget the difference in their size, and accost him as though they two were equal. What though some fell blow, levelled as at an ox, should lay him low for ever. Better that, than endure from day to day the unanswered taunts of such a one as Jones! Mr. Brown, though he was not quick-witted, was not deficient when the feelings of man and man were concerned. He understood it all, and taking advantage of a moment when Jones had stepped up the shop, he pressed Robinson\u0027s hand and said,—\"You shall have her, George. If a father\u0027s word is worth anything, you shall have her.\" But in this case,—as in so many others,—a father\u0027s word was not worth anything. \"But to business!\" said Robinson, shaking off from him all thoughts of love. After that Mr. Brown had not the heart to oppose him respecting the glass, and in that matter he had everything nearly his own way. The premises stood advantageously at the comer of a little alley, so that the window was made to jut out sideways in that direction, and a full foot and a half was gained. On the other side the house did not stand flush with its neighbour,—as is not unfrequently the case in Bishopsgate Street,—and here also a few inches were made available. The next neighbour, a quiet old man who sold sticks, threatened a lawsuit; but that, had it been instituted, would have got into the newspapers and been an advertisement. There was considerable trouble about the entrance. A wide, commanding centre doorway was essential; but this, if made in the desirable proportions, would have terribly crippled the side windows. To obviate this difficulty, the exterior space allotted for the entrance between the frontage of the two windows was broad and noble, but the glass splayed inwards towards the shop, so that the absolute door was decidedly narrow. \"When we come to have a crowd, they won\u0027t get in and out,\" said Jones. \"If we could only crush a few to death in the doorway our fortune would be made,\" said Robinson. \"God forbid!\" said Mr. Brown; \"God forbid! Let us have no bloodshed, whatever we do.\" In about a month the house was completed, and much to the regret of both the junior partners, a considerable sum of ready money was paid to the tradesmen who performed the work. Mr. Jones was of opinion that by sufficient cunning such payments might be altogether evaded. No such thought rested for a moment in the bosom of Mr. Robinson. All tradesmen should be paid, and paid well. But the great firm of Brown, Jones, and Robinson would be much less likely to scrutinize the price at which plate glass was charged to them per square foot, when they were taking their hundreds a day over the counter, than they would be now when every shilling was of importance to them. \"For their own sake you shouldn\u0027t do it,\" said he to Mr. Brown. \"You may be quite sure they don\u0027t like it.\" \"I always liked it myself,\" said Mr. Brown. And thus he would make little dribbling payments, by which an unfortunate idea was generated in the neighbourhood that money was not plentiful with the firm.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2752/75844.html","bookId":1350,"book":{"id":1350,"title":"The Struggles of Brown, Jones, and Robinson","description":"简介： It will be observed by the literary and commercial world that, in this transaction, the name of the really responsible party does not show on the title-page.
