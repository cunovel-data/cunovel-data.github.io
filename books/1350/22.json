{"id":20907,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXI. MR. BROWN IS TAKEN ILL.","content":"Brisket kept his word, and never entered Magenta House again, nor, as far as George Robinson is aware, has he seen any of the Brown family from that day on which he gave up his intended marriage to this present. For awhile Maryanne Brown protested that she was well satisfied that this should be so. She declared to Mrs. Poppins that the man was mercenary, senseless, uninteresting, heavy, and brutal;—and though in the bosom of her own family she did not speak out with equal freedom, yet from time to time she dropped words to show that she was not breaking her heart for William Brisket. But this mood did not last long. Before winter had come round the bitterness of gall had risen within her heart, and when Christmas was there her frame of mind was comfortable neither to herself nor to her unfortunate father. During this time the house still went on. Set a business going, and it is astonishing how long it will continue to move by the force of mere daily routine. People flocked in for shirts and stockings, and young women came there to seek their gloves and ribbons, although but little was done to attract them, either in the way of advertisement or of excellence of supply. Throughout this wretched month or two Robinson knew that failure was inevitable, and with this knowledge it was almost impossible that he should actively engage himself in his own peculiar branch of business. There was no confidence between the partners. Jones was conscious of what was coming and was more eager than ever to feather his own nest. But in these days Mr. Brown displayed a terrible activity. He was constantly in the shop, and though it was evident to all eyes that care and sorrow were heaping upon his shoulders a burden which he could hardly bear, he watched his son-in-law with the eyes of an Argus. It was terrible to see him, and terrible, alas, to hear him;—for at this time he had no reserve before the men and women engaged behind the counters. At first there had been a pretence of great love and confidence, but this was now all over. It was known to all the staff that Mr. Brown watched his son-in-law, and known also that the youngest partner had been treated with injustice by them both. They in the shop, and even Jones himself, knew little of what in these days was going on upstairs. But Robinson knew, for his room was close to that in which Mr. Brown and his daughter lived; and, moreover, in spite of the ill-feeling which could not but exist between him and Miss Brown, he passed many hours in that room with her father. The bitterness of gall had now risen within her breast, and she had begun to realize that truth which must be so terrible for a woman, that she had fallen to the ground between two stools. It is a truth terrible to a woman. There is no position in a man\u0027s life of the same aspect. A man may fail in business, and feel that no further chance of any real success can ever come in his way; or he may fail in love, and in the soreness of his heart may know that the pleasant rippling waters of that fountain are for him dried for ever. But with a woman the two things are joined together. Her battle must be fought all in one. Her success in life and her romance must go together, hand in hand. She is called upon to marry for love, and if she marry not for love, she disobeys the ordinance of nature and must pay the penalty. But at the same time all her material fortune depends upon the nature of that love. An industrious man may marry a silly fretful woman, and may be triumphant in his counting-house though he be bankrupt in his drawing-room. But a woman has but the one chance. She must choose her life\u0027s companion because she loves him; but she knows how great is the ruin of loving one who cannot win for her that worldly success which all in the world desire to win. With Maryanne Brown these considerations had become frightfully momentous. She had in her way felt the desire for some romance in life, but she had felt more strongly still how needful it was that she should attain by her feminine charms a position which would put her above want. \"As long as I have a morsel, you shall have half of it,\" her father had said to her more than once. And she had answered him with terrible harshness, \"But what am I to do when you have no longer a morsel to share with me? When you are ruined, or dead, where must I then look for support and shelter?\" The words were harsh, and she was a very Regan to utter them. But, nevertheless, they were natural. It was manifest enough that her father would not provide for her, and for her there was nothing but Eve\u0027s lot of finding an Adam who would dig for her support. She was hard, coarse,—almost heartless; but it may perhaps be urged in her favour, that she was not wilfully dishonest. She had been promised to one man, and though she did not love him she would have married him, intending to do her duty. But to this he would not consent, except under certain money circumstances which she could not command. Then she learned to love another man, and him she would have married; but prudence told her that she should not do so until he had a home in which to place her. And thus she fell to the ground between two stools, and, falling, perceived that there was nothing before her on which her eye could rest with satisfaction. There are women, very many women, who could bear this, if with sadness, still without bitterness. It is a lot which many women have to bear; but Maryanne Brown was one within whose bosom all feelings were turned to gall by the prospect of such a destiny. What had she done to deserve such degradation and misfortune? She would have been an honest wife to either husband! That it could be her own fault in any degree she did not for a moment admit. It was the fault of those around her, and she was not the woman to allow such a fault to pass unavenged. \"Father,\" she would say, \"you will be in the workhouse before this new year is ended.\" \"I hope not, my child.\" \"Hope! What\u0027s the good of hoping? You will. And where am I to go then? Mother left a handsome fortune behind her, and this is what you\u0027ve brought us to.\" \"I\u0027ve done everything for the best, Maryanne.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you give that man the money when you had it? You\u0027d have had a home then when you\u0027d ruined yourself. Now you\u0027ll have no home; neither shall I.\" All this was very hard to be borne. \"She nags at me that dreadful, George,\" he once said, as he sat in his old arm-chair, with his head hanging wearily on his chest, \"that I don\u0027t know where I am or what I\u0027m doing. As for the workhouse, I almost wish I was there.\" She would go also to Poppins\u0027 lodgings, and there quarrel with her old friend Polly. It may be that at this time she did not receive all the respect that had been paid to her some months back, and this reverse was, to her proud spirit, unendurable. \"Polly,\" she said, \"if you wish to turn your back upon me, you can do so. But I won\u0027t put up with your airs.\" \"There\u0027s nobody turning their back upon you, only yourself,\" Polly replied; \"but it\u0027s frightful to hear the way you\u0027re always a-grumbling;—as if other people hadn\u0027t had their ups and downs besides you.\" Robinson also was taught by the manner of his friend Poppins that he could not now expect to receive that high deference which was paid to him about the time that Johnson of Manchester had been in the ascendant. Those had been the halcyon days of the firm, and Robinson had then been happy. Men at that time would point him out as he passed, as one worthy of notice; his companions felt proud when he would join them; and they would hint to him, with a mysterious reverence that was very gratifying, their assurance that he was so deeply occupied as to make it impossible that he should give his time to the ordinary slow courtesies of life. All this was over now, and he felt that he was pulled down with rough hands from the high place which he had occupied. \"It\u0027s all very well,\" Poppins would say to him, \"but the fact is, you\u0027re a-doing of nothing.\" \"If fourteen hours a day—\" began Robinson. But Poppins instantly stopped him. \"Fourteen hours\u0027 work a day is nothing, if you don\u0027t do anything. A man may sweat hard digging holes and filling them up again. But what I say is, he does not do any good. You\u0027ve been making out all these long stories about things that never existed, but what\u0027s the world the better for it;—that\u0027s what I want to know. When a man makes a pair of shoes—.\" And so he went on. Coming from such a man as Poppins, this was hard to be borne. But nevertheless Robinson did bear it. Men at the \"Goose and Gridiron\" also would shoulder him now-a-days, rather than make way for him. Geese whose names had never been heard beyond the walls of that room would presume to occupy his place. And on one occasion, when he rose to address the chamber, the Grand omitted the courtesy that had ever been paid to him, and forgot to lay down his pipe. This also he bore without flinching. It was about the middle of February when a catastrophe happened which was the immediate forerunner of the fall of the house. Robinson had been at his desk early in the morning,—for, though his efforts were now useless, he was always there; and had been struck with dismay by the loudness of Maryanne\u0027s tone as she rebuked her father. Then Mrs. Jones had joined them, and the battle had raged still more furiously. The voice of the old man, too, was heard from time to time. When roused by suffering to anger he would forget to speak in his usual falsetto treble, and break out in a few natural words of rough impassioned wrath. At about ten, Mr. Brown came down into Robinson\u0027s room, and, seating himself on a low chair, remained there for awhile without moving, and almost without speaking. \"Is she gone, George?\" he asked at last. \"Which of them?\" said Robinson. \"Sarah Jane. I\u0027m not so used to her, and it\u0027s very bad.\" Then Robinson looked out and said that Mrs. Jones was gone. Whereupon Mr. Brown returned to his own room. Again and again throughout the day Robinson heard the voices; but he did not go up to the room. He never did go there now, unless specially called upon to do so by business. At about noon, however, there came a sudden silence,—a silence so sudden that he noticed it. And then he heard a quick step across the floor. It was nothing to him, and he did not move from his seat; but still he kept his ears open, and sat thoughtless of other matters, as though he expected that something was about to happen. The room above was perfectly still, and for a minute or two nothing was done. But then there came the fall of a quicker step across the room, and the door was opened, and Maryanne, descending the four stairs which led to his own closet, was with him in an instant. \"George,\" she said, forgetting all propriety of demeanour, \"father\u0027s in a fit!\" It is not necessary that the scene which followed should be described with minuteness in these pages. Robinson, of course, went up to Mr. Brown\u0027s room, and a doctor was soon there in attendance upon the sick man. He had been struck by paralysis, and thus for a time had been put beyond the reach of his daughters\u0027 anger. Sarah Jane was very soon there, but the wretched state in which the old man was lying quieted even her tongue. She did not dare to carry on the combat as she looked on the contorted features and motionless limbs of the poor wretch as he lay on his bed. On her mind came the conviction that this was partly her work, and that if she now spoke above her breath, those around her would accuse her of her cruelty. So she slunk about into corners, whispering now and again with her husband, and quickly took herself off, leaving the task of nursing the old man to the higher courage of her sister. And Maryanne\u0027s courage sufficed for the work. Now that she had a task before her she did it;—as she would have done her household tasks had she become the wife of Brisket or of Robinson. To the former she would have been a good wife, for he would have required no softness. She would have been true to him, tending him and his children;—scolding them from morning to night, and laying not unfrequently a rough hand upon them. But for this Brisket would not have cared. He would have been satisfied, and all would have been well. It is a thousand pities that, in that matter, Brisket could not have seen his way. And now that her woman\u0027s services were really needed, she gave them to her father readily. It cannot be said that she was a cheerful nurse. Had he been in a state in which cheerfulness would have relieved him, her words would have again been sharp and pointed. She was silent and sullen, thinking always of the bad days that were coming to her. But, nevertheless, she was attentive to him,—and during the time of his terrible necessity even good to him. It is so natural to women to be so, that I think even Regan would have nursed Lear had Lear\u0027s body become impotent instead of his mind. There she sat close to his bed, and there from time to time Robinson would visit her. In those days they always called each other George and Maryanne, and were courteous to each other, speaking solely of the poor old sick man, who was so near to them both. Of their former joint hopes, no word was spoken then; nor, at any rate as regards the lady, was there even a thought of love. As to Jones, he very rarely came there. He remained in the shop below; where the presence of some member of the firm was very necessary, for, in these days, the number of hands employed had become low. \"I suppose it\u0027s all up down there,\" she said one day, and as she spoke she pointed towards the shop. At this time her father had regained his consciousness, and had recovered partially the use of his limbs. But even yet he could not speak so as to be understood, and was absolutely helpless. The door of his bedroom was open, and Robinson was sitting in the front room, to which it opened. \"I\u0027m afraid so,\" said he. \"There are creditors who are pressing us; and now that they have been frightened about Mr. Brown, we shall be sold up.\" \"You mean the advertising people?\" \"Yes; the stationer and printer, and one or two of the agents. The fact is, that the money, which should have satisfied them, has been frittered away uselessly.\" \"It\u0027s gone at any rate,\" said she. \"He hasn\u0027t got it,\" and she pointed to her father. \"Nor have I,\" said Robinson. \"I came into it empty-handed, and I shall go out as empty. No one shall say that I cared more for myself than for the firm. I\u0027ve done my best, and we have failed. That\u0027s all.\" \"I am not going to blame you, George. My look-out is bad enough, but I will not say that you did it. It is worse for a woman than for a man. And what am I to do with him?\" And again she pointed towards the inner room. In answer to this Robinson said something as to the wind being tempered for the shorn lamb. \"As far as I can see,\" she continued, \"the sheep is best off that knows how to keep its own wool. It\u0027s always such cold comfort as that one gets, when the world means to thrust one to the wall. It\u0027s only the sheep that lets themselves be shorn. The lions and the tigers know how to keep their own coats on their own backs. I believe the wind blows colder on poor naked wretches than it does on those as have their carriages to ride in. Providence is very good to them that know how to provide for themselves.\" \"You are young,\" said he, \"and beautiful—\" \"Psha!\" \"You will always find a home if you require one.\" \"Yes; and sell myself! I\u0027ll tell you what it is, George Robinson; I wish to enter no man\u0027s home unless I can earn my meat there by my work. No man shall tell me that I am eating his bread for nothing. As for love, I don\u0027t believe in it. It\u0027s all very well for them as have nothing to do and nothing to think of,—for young ladies who get up at ten in the morning, and ride about with young gentlemen, and spend half their time before their looking-glasses. It\u0027s like those poetry books you\u0027re so fond of. But it\u0027s not meant for them as must earn their bread by their own sweat. You talk about love, but it\u0027s only madness for the like of you.\" \"I shall talk about it no more.\" \"You can\u0027t afford it, George; nor yet can\u0027t I. What a man wants in a wife is some one to see to his cooking and his clothes; and what a woman wants is a man who can put a house over her head. Of course, if she have something of her own, she\u0027ll have so much the better house. As for me, I\u0027ve got nothing now.\" \"That would have made no difference with me.\" Robinson knew that he was wrong to say this, but he could not help it. He knew that he would be a madman if he again gave way to any feeling of tenderness for this girl, who could be so hard in her manner, so harsh in her speech, and whose temperament was so utterly unsuited to his own. But as she was hard and harsh, so was he in all respects the reverse. As she had told him over and over again, he was tender-hearted even to softness. \"No; it wouldn\u0027t,\" she replied. \"And, therefore, with all your cleverness, you are little better than a fool. You have been working hard and living poor these two years back, and what better are you? When that old man was weak enough to give you the last of his money, you didn\u0027t keep a penny.\" \"Not a penny,\" said Robinson, with some feeling of pride at his heart. \"And what the better are you for that? Look at them Joneses; they have got money. When the crash comes, they won\u0027t have to walk out into the street. They\u0027ll start somewhere in a little way, and will do very well.\" \"And would you have had me become a thief?\" \"A thief! You needn\u0027t have been a thief. You needn\u0027t have taken it out of the drawers as some of them did. I couldn\u0027t do that myself. I\u0027ve been sore tempted, but I could never bring myself to that.\" Then she got up, and went to her father, and Robinson returned again to the figures that were before him. \"What am I to do with him?\" she again said, when she returned. \"When he is able to move, and the house is taken away from us, what am I to do with him? He\u0027s been bad to me, but I won\u0027t leave him.\" \"Neither will I leave him, Maryanne.\" \"That\u0027s nonsense. You\u0027ve got nothing, no more than he has; and he\u0027s not your flesh and blood. Where would you have been now, if we\u0027d been married on that day.\" \"I should have been nearer to him in blood, but not truer to him as a partner.\" \"It\u0027s lucky for you that your sort of partnership needn\u0027t last for ever. You\u0027ve got your hands and your brain, and at any rate you can work. But who can say what must become of us? Looking at it all through, George, I have been treated hard;—haven\u0027t I, now?\" He could only say that of such hard treatment none of it rested on his conscience. At such a moment as this he could not explain to her that had she herself been more willing to trust in others, more prone to believe in Providence, less hard and worldly, things would have been better with her. Even now, could she have relaxed into tenderness for half-an-hour, there was one at her elbow who would have taken her at once, with all that burden of a worn-out pauper parent, and have poured into her lap all the earnings of his life. But Maryanne Brown could not relax into tenderness, nor would she ever deign to pretend that she could do so. The first day on which Mr. Brown was able to come out into the sitting-room was the very day on which Brown, Jones, and Robinson were declared bankrupts. Craddock and Giles, the stationers of St. Mary Axe, held bills of theirs, as to which they would not,—or probably could not,—wait; and the City and West End Commercial and Agricultural Joint-Stock Bank refused to make any further advances. It was a sad day; but one, at least, of the partners felt relieved when the blow had absolutely fallen, and the management of the affairs of the shop was taken out of the hands of the firm. \"And will we be took to prison?\" asked Mr. Brown. They were almost the first articulate words which he had been heard to utter since the fit had fallen on him; and Robinson was quick to assure him that no such misfortune would befall him. \"They are not at all bitter against us,\" said Robinson. \"They know we have done our best.\" \"And what will they do with us?\" again asked Mr. Brown. \"We shall have a sale, and clear out everything, and pay a dividend;—and then the world will be open to us for further efforts.\" \"The world will never be open to me again,\" said Mr. Brown. \"And if I had only have kept the money when I had it—\" \"Mr. Brown,\" said Robinson, taking him by the hand, \"you are ill now, and seen through the sickly hue of weakness and infirmity, affairs look bad and distressing; but ere long you will regain your strength.\" \"No, George, I shall never do that.\" On this day the business of the shop still went on, but the proceeds of such sales as were made were carried to the credit of the assignees. Mr. Jones was there throughout the day, doing nothing, and hardly speaking to any one. He would walk slowly from the front of the shop to the back, and then returning would stand in the doorway, rubbing his hands one over the other. When any female of specially smart appearance entered the shop, he would hand to her a chair, and whisper a few words of oily courtesy; but to those behind the counter he did not speak a word. In the afternoon Mrs. Jones made her appearance, and when she had been there a few minutes, was about to raise the counter door and go behind; but her husband took her almost roughly by the arm, and muttering something to her, caused her to leave the shop. \"Ah, I knew what such dishonest doings must come to,\" she said, as she went her way. \"And, what\u0027s more, I know who\u0027s to blame.\" And yet it was she and her husband who had brought this ruin on the firm. \"George,\" said Mr. Brown, that evening, \"I have intended for the best,—I have indeed.\" \"Nobody blames you, sir.\" \"You blame me about Maryanne.\" \"No, by heaven; not now.\" \"And she blames me about the money; but I\u0027ve meant it for the best;—I have indeed.\" All this occurred on a Saturday, and on that same evening Robinson attended at his debating club, for the express purpose of explaining to the members the state of his own firm. \"It shall never be thrown in my teeth,\" said he, \"that I became a bankrupt and was ashamed to own it.\" So he got up and made a speech, in which he stated that Brown, Jones, and Robinson had failed, but that he could not lay it to his own charge that he had been guilty of any omission or commission of which he had reason to be ashamed as a British merchant. This is mentioned here, in order that a fitting record may be made of the very high compliment which was paid to him on the occasion by old Pancabinet. \"Most worthy Grand,\" said old Pan, and as he spoke he looked first at the chairman and then down the long table of the room, \"I am sure I may truly say that we have all of us heard the statement made by the enterprising and worthy Goose with sentiments of regret and pain; but I am equally sure that we have none of us heard it with any idea that either dishonour or disgrace can attach itself in the matter to the name of—\" (Order, order, order.) \"Worthy Geese are a little too quick,\" continued the veteran debater with a smile—\"to the name of—one whom we all so highly value.\" (Hear, hear, hear.) And then old Pancabinet moved that the enterprising and worthy Goose was entitled to the full confidence of the chamber. Crowdy magnanimously seconded the motion, and the resolution, when carried, was communicated to Robinson by the worthy Grand. Having thanked them in a few words, which were almost inaudible from his emotion, he left the chamber, and immediately afterwards the meeting was adjourned.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2752/75862.html","bookId":1350,"book":{"id":1350,"title":"The Struggles of Brown, Jones, and Robinson","description":"简介： It will be observed by the literary and commercial world that, in this transaction, the name of the really responsible party does not show on the title-page.
