{"id":20892,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII.","content":"MISS BROWN PLEADS HER OWN CASE, \\n\\n AND MR. ROBINSON WALKS ON BLACKFRIARS BRIDGE. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n At the time of Mrs. McCockerell\u0027s death Robinson and Maryanne Brown were not on comfortable terms with each other. She had twitted him with being remiss in asserting his own rights in the presence of his rival, and he had accused her of being fickle, if not actually false. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall be just as fickle as I please,\" she said. \"If it suits me I\u0027ll have nine to follow me; but there shan\u0027t be one of the nine who won\u0027t hold up his head and look after his own.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your conduct, Maryanne—.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"George, I won\u0027t be scolded, and that you ought to know. If you don\u0027t like me, you are quite welcome to do the other thing.\" And then they parted. This took place after Mr. Brown\u0027s adherence to the Robinson interest, and while Brisket was waiting passively to see if that five hundred pounds would be forthcoming. \\n\\n \\n\\n Their next meeting was in the presence of Mr. Brown; and on that occasion all the three spoke out their intentions on the subject of their future family arrangements, certainly with much plain language, if not on every side with positive truth. Mr. Robinson was at the house in Smithfield, giving counsel to old Mr. Brown as to the contest which was then being urged between him and his son-in-law. At that period the two sisters conceived that their joint pecuniary interests required that they should act together; and it must be acknowledged that they led poor Mr. Brown a sad life of it. He and Robinson were sitting upstairs in the little back room looking out into Spavinhorse Yard, when Maryanne abruptly broke in upon them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Father,\" she said, standing upright in the middle of the room before them, \"I have come to know what it is that you mean to do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To do, my dear?\" said old Mr. Brown. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; to do. I suppose something is to be done some day. We ain\u0027t always to go on shilly-shallying, spending the money, and ruining the business, and living from hand to mouth, as though there was no end to anything. I\u0027ve got myself to look to, and I don\u0027t mean to go into the workhouse if I can help it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The workhouse, Maryanne!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I said the workhouse, father, and I meant it. If everybody had what was justly their own, I shouldn\u0027t have to talk in that way. But as far as I can see, them sharks, the lawyers, will have it all. Now, I\u0027ll tell you what it is—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Hitherto Robinson had not said a word; but at this moment he thought it right to interfere. \"Maryanne!\" he said,—and, in pronouncing the well-loved name, he threw into it all the affection of which his voice was capable,—\"Maryanne!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Miss Brown\u0027 would be a deal properer, and also much more pleasing, if it\u0027s all the same to you, sir!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n How often had he whispered \"Maryanne\" into her ears, and the dear girl had smiled upon him to hear herself so called! But he could not remind her of this at the present moment. \"I have your father\u0027s sanction,\" said he— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My father is nothing to me,—not with reference to what young man I let myself be called \u0027Maryanne\u0027 by. And going on as he is going on, I don\u0027t suppose that he\u0027ll long be much to me in any way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Maryanne!\" sobbed the unhappy parent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s all very well, sir, but it won\u0027t keep the kettle a-boiling!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As long as I have a bit to eat of, Maryanne, and a cup to drink of, you shall have the half.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what am I to do when you won\u0027t have neither a bit nor a cup? That\u0027s what you\u0027re coming to, father. We can all see that. What\u0027s the use of all them lawyers?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s Jones\u0027s doing,\" said Robinson. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; it isn\u0027t Jones\u0027s doing. And of course Jones must look after himself. I\u0027m not partial to Jones. Everybody knows that. When Sarah Jane disgraced herself, and went off with him, I never said a word in her favour. It wasn\u0027t I who brought a viper into the house and warmed it in my bosom.\" It was at this moment that Jones was behaving with the most barefaced effrontery, as well as the utmost cruelty, towards the old man, and Maryanne\u0027s words cut her father to the very soul. \"Jones might have been anywhere for me,\" she continued; \"but there he is downstairs, and Sarah Jane is with him. Of course they are looking for their own.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what is it you want, Maryanne?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well; I\u0027ll tell you what I want. My dear sainted mother\u0027s last wish was that—I should become Mrs. Brisket!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And do you mean to say,\" said Robinson—\"do you mean to say that that is now your wish?\" And he looked at her till the audacity even of her eyes sank beneath the earnestness of his own. But though for the moment he quelled her eye, nothing could quell her voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I mean to say,\" said she, speaking loudly, and with her arms akimbo, \"that William Brisket is a very respectable young man, with a trade,—that he\u0027s got a decent house for a young woman to live in, and a decent table for her to sit at. And he\u0027s always been brought up decent, having been a regular \u0027prentice to his uncle, and all that sort of thing. He\u0027s never been wandering about like a vagrant, getting his money nobody knows how. William Brisket\u0027s as well known in Aldersgate Street as the Post Office. And moreover,\" she added, after a pause, speaking these last words in a somewhat milder breath—\"And moreover, it was my sainted mother\u0027s wish!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then go to him!\" said Robinson, rising suddenly, and stretching out his arm against her. \"Go to him, and perform your—sainted mother\u0027s wish! Go to the—butcher! Revel in his shambles, and grow fat and sleek in his slaughter-house! From this moment George Robinson will fight the world alone. Brisket, indeed! If it be accounted manliness to have killed hecatombs of oxen, let him be called manly!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He would have pretty nigh killed you, young man, on one occasion, if you hadn\u0027t made yourself scarce.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By heavens!\" exclaimed Robinson, \"if he\u0027ll come forth, I\u0027ll fight him to-morrow;—with cleavers, if he will!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"George, George, don\u0027t say that,\" exclaimed Mr. Brown. \"\u0027Let dogs delight to bark and bite.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You needn\u0027t be afraid,\" said Maryanne. \"He doesn\u0027t mean fighting,\" and she pointed to Robinson. \"William would about eat him, you know, if they were to come together.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Heaven forbid!\" said Mr. Brown. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But what I want to know is this,\" continued the maiden; \"how is it to be about that five hundred pounds which my mother left me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, my dear, your mother had not five hundred pounds to leave.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nor did she make any will if she had,\" said Robinson. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now don\u0027t put in your oar, for I won\u0027t have it,\" said the lady. \"And you\u0027d show a deal more correct feeling if you wasn\u0027t so much about the house just at present. My darling mamma,\"—and then she put her handkerchief up to her eyes—\"always told William that when he and I became one, there should be five hundred pounds down;—and of course he expects it. Now, sir, you often talk about your love for your children.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do love them; so I do. What else have I?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now\u0027s the time to prove it. Let me have that sum of five hundred pounds, and I will always take your part against the Joneses. Five hundred pounds isn\u0027t so much,—and surely I have a right to some share. And you may be sure of this; when we\u0027re settled, Brisket is not the man to come back to you for more, as some would do.\" And then she gave another look at Robinson. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t got the money; have I, George?\" said the father. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That question I cannot answer,\" replied Robinson. \"Nor can I say how far it might be prudent in you to debar yourself from all further progress in commerce if you have got it. But this I can say; do not let any consideration for me prevent you from giving a dowry with your daughter to Mr. Brisket; if she loves him—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, it\u0027s all bother about love,\" said she; \"men and women must eat, and they must have something to give their children, when they come.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But if I haven\u0027t got it, my dear?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s nonsense, father. Where has the money gone to? Whatever you do, speak the truth. If you choose to say you won\u0027t—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, then, I won\u0027t,\" said he, roused suddenly to anger. \"I never made Brisket any promise!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But mother did; she as is now gone, and far away; and it was her money,—so it was.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t her money;—it was mine!\" said Mr. Brown. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And that\u0027s all the answer I\u0027m to get? Very well. Then I shall know where to look for my rights. And as for that fellow there, I didn\u0027t think it of him, that he\u0027d be so mean. I knew he was a coward always.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am neither mean nor a coward,\" said Robinson, jumping up, and speaking with a voice that was audible right across Spavinhorse Yard, and into the tap of the \"Man of Mischief\" public-house opposite. \"As for meanness, if I had the money, I would pour it out into your lap, though I knew that it was to be converted into beef and mutton for the benefit of a hated rival. And as for cowardice, I repel the charge, and drive it back into the teeth of him who, doubtless, made it. I am no coward.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You ran away when he bid you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; because he is big and strong, and had I remained, he would have knocked me about, and made me ridiculous in the eyes of the spectators. But I am no coward. If you wish it, I am ready to fight him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, dear, no. It can be nothing to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He will make me one mash of gore,\" said Robinson, still holding out his hand. \"But if you wish it, I care nothing for that. His brute strength will, of course, prevail; but I am indifferent as to that, if it would do you a pleasure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pleasure to me! Nothing of the kind, I can assure you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maryanne, if I might have my wish, it should be this. Let us both sit down, with our cigars lighted,—ay, and with tapers in our hands,—on an open barrel of gunpowder. Then let him who will sit there longest receive this fair hand as his prize.\" And as he finished, he leaned over her, and took up her hand in his. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Laws, Robinson!\" she said; but she did not on the moment withdraw her hand. \"And if you were both blew up, what\u0027d I do then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I won\u0027t hear of such an arrangement,\" said Mr. Brown. \"It would be very wicked. If there\u0027s another word spoke about it, I\u0027ll go to the police at once!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n On that occasion Mr. Brown was quite determined about the money; and, as we heard afterwards, Mr. Brisket expressed himself as equally resolute. \"Of course, I expect to see my way,\" said he; \"I can\u0027t do anything of that sort without seeing my way.\" When that overture about the gunpowder was repeated to him, he is reported to have become very red. \"Either with gloves or without, or with the sticks, I\u0027m ready for him,\" said he; \"but as for sitting on a barrel of gunpowder, it\u0027s a thing as nobody wouldn\u0027t do unless they was in Bedlam.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When that interview was over, Robinson walked forth by himself into the evening air, along Giltspur Street, down the Old Bailey, and so on by Bridge Street, to the middle of Blackfriars Bridge; and as he walked, he strove manfully to get the better of the passion which was devouring the strength of his blood, and the marrow of his bones. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If she be not fair for me,\" he sang to himself, \"what care I how fair she be?\" But he did care; he could not master that passion. She had been vile to him, unfeminine, untrue, coarsely abusive; she had shown herself to be mercenary, incapable of true love, a scold, fickle, and cruel. But yet he loved her. There was a gallant feeling at his heart that no misfortune could conquer him,—but one; that misfortune had fallen upon him,—and he was conquered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why is it,\" he said as he looked down into the turbid stream—\"why is it that bloodshed, physical strife, and brute power are dear to them all? Any fool can have personal bravery; \u0027tis but a sign of folly to know no fear. Grant that a man has no imagination, and he cannot fear; but when a man does fear, and yet is brave—\" Then for awhile he stopped himself. \"Would that I had gone at his throat like a dog!\" he continued, still in his soliloquy. \"Would that I had! Could I have torn out his tongue, and laid it as a trophy at her feet, then she would have loved me.\" After that he wandered slowly home, and went to bed. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2752/75847.html","bookId":1350,"book":{"id":1350,"title":"The Struggles of Brown, Jones, and Robinson","description":"简介： It will be observed by the literary and commercial world that, in this transaction, the name of the really responsible party does not show on the title-page.
