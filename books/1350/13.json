{"id":20898,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XII. SAMSON AND DELILAH.","content":"In the commercial world of London there was one man who was really anxious to know what were the actual facts of the case with reference to Johnson of Manchester. This was Mr. William Brisket, whose mind at this time was perplexed by grievous doubts. He was called upon to act in a case of great emergency, and was by no means sure that he saw his way. It had been hinted to him by Miss Brown, on the one side, that it behoved her to look to herself, and take her pigs to market without any more shilly-shallying,—by which expression the fair girl had intended to signify that it would suit her now to name her wedding-day. And he had been informed by Mr. Brown, on the other side, that that sum of five hundred pounds should be now forthcoming;—or, if not actually the money, Mr. Brown\u0027s promissory note at six months should be handed to him, dated from the day of his marriage with Maryanne. \\n\\n \\n\\n Under these circumstances, he did not see his way. That the house in Bishopsgate Street was doing a large business he did not doubt. He visited the place often, and usually found the shop crowded. But he did doubt whether that business was very lucrative. It might be that the whole thing was a bubble, and that it would be burst before that bill should have been honoured. In such case, he would have saddled himself with an empty-handed wife, and would decidedly not have seen his way. In this emergency he went to Jones and asked his advice. Jones told him confidentially that, though the bill of the firm for five thousand pounds would be as good as paper from the Bank of England, the bill of Mr. Brown himself as an individual would be worth nothing. \\n\\n \\n\\n Although Mr. Brisket had gone to Jones as a friend, there had been some very sharp words between them before they separated. Brisket knew well enough that all the ready money at the command of the firm had belonged to Mr. Brown, and he now took upon himself to say that Maryanne had a right to her share. Jones replied that there was no longer anything to share, and that Maryanne\u0027s future husband must wait for her fortune till her father could pay it out of his income. \"I couldn\u0027t see my way like that; not at all,\" said Brisket. And then there had been high words between them. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was at this time that the first act of Johnson of Manchester\u0027s little comedy was being played, and people in Mr. Brisket\u0027s world were beginning to talk about the matter. \"They must be doing a deal of trade,\" said one. \"Believe me, it is all flash and sham,\" said another. \"I happen to know that old Brown did go down to Manchester and see Johnson there,\" said the first. \"There is no such person at all,\" said the second. So this went on till Mr. Brisket resolved that his immediate matrimony should depend on the reality of Johnson\u0027s existence. If it should appear that Johnson, with all his paper, was a false meteor; that no one had deceived the metropolitan public; that no one had been taken and had then escaped, he would tell Miss Brown that he did not see his way. The light of his intelligence told him that promissory notes from such a source, even though signed by all the firm, would be illusory. If, on the other hand, Johnson of Manchester had been taken, then, he thought, he might accept the bill—and wife. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maryanne,\" he said to the young lady early on that day on which she had afterwards had her interview with Robinson, \"what\u0027s all this about Johnson of Manchester?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know nothing about your Johnsons, nor yet about your Manchester,\" said Miss Brown, standing with her back to her lover. At this time she was waxing wroth with him, and had learned to hate his voice, when he would tell her that he had not yet seen his way. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s all very well, Maryanne; but I must know something before I go on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who wants you to go on? Not I, I\u0027m sure; nor anybody belonging to me. If I do hate anything, it\u0027s them mercenary ways. There\u0027s one who really loves me, who\u0027d be above asking for a shilling, if I\u0027d only put out my hand to him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you say that again, Maryanne, I\u0027ll punch his head.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re always talking of punching people\u0027s heads; but I don\u0027t see you do so much. I shouldn\u0027t wonder if you don\u0027t want to punch my head some of these days.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maryanne, I never riz a hand to a woman yet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you\u0027d better not, as far as I\u0027m concerned,—not as long as the pokers and tongs are about.\" And then there was silence between them for awhile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Maryanne,\" he began again, \"can\u0027t you find out about this Johnson?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; I can\u0027t,\" said she. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027d better.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then I won\u0027t,\" said she. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what it is, then, Maryanne. I don\u0027t see my way the least in life about this money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Drat your way! Who cares about your way?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s all very fine, Maryanne; but I care. I\u0027m a man as is as good as my word, and always was. I defy Brown, Jones, and Robinson to say that I\u0027m off, carrying anybody\u0027s paper. And as for paper, it\u0027s a thing as I knows nothing about, and never wish. When a man comes to paper, it seems to me there\u0027s a very thin wall betwixt him and the gutter. When I buys a score of sheep or so, I pays for them down; and when I sells a leg of mutton, I expects no less myself. I don\u0027t owe a shilling to no one, and don\u0027t mean; and the less that any one owes me, the better I like it. But Maryanne, when a man trades in that way, a man must see his way. If he goes about in the dark, or with his eyes shut, he\u0027s safe to get a fall. Now about this five hundred pound; if I could only see my way—.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As to the good sense of Mr. Brisket\u0027s remarks, there was no difference of opinion between him and his intended wife. Miss Brown would at that time have been quite contented to enter into partnership for life on those terms. And though these memoirs are written with the express view of advocating a theory of trade founded on quite a different basis, nevertheless, it may be admitted that Mr. Brisket\u0027s view of commerce has its charms, presuming that a man has the wherewithal. But such a view is apt to lose its charms in female eyes if it be insisted on too often, or too violently. Maryanne had long since given in her adhesion to Mr. Brisket\u0027s theory; but now, weary with repetition of the lesson, she was disposed to rebel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, William Brisket,\" she said, \"just listen to me. If you talk to me again about seeing your way, you may go and see it by yourself. I\u0027m not so badly off that I\u0027m going to have myself twitted at in that way. If you don\u0027t like me, you can do the other thing. And this I will say, when a gentleman has spoken his mind free to a lady, and a lady has given her answer free back to him, it\u0027s a very mean thing for a gentleman to be saying so much about money after that. Of course, a girl has got herself to look to; and if I take up with you, why, of course, I have to say, \u0027Stand off,\u0027 to any other young man as may wish to keep me company. Now, there\u0027s one as shall be nameless that wouldn\u0027t demean himself to say a word about money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because he ain\u0027t got none himself, as I take it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s a partner in a first-rate commercial firm. And I\u0027ll tell you what, William Brisket, I\u0027ll not hear a word said against him, and I\u0027ll not be put upon myself. So now I wishes you good morning.\" And so she left him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Brisket, when he was alone, scratched his head, and thought wistfully of his love. \"I should like to see my way,\" said he. \"I always did like to see my way. And as for that old man\u0027s bit of paper—\" Then he relapsed once again into silence. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was within an hour of all this that Maryanne had followed her father to George Robinson\u0027s room. She had declared her utter indifference as to Johnson of Manchester; but yet it might, perhaps, be as well that she should learn the truth. From her father she had tried to get it, but he had succeeded in keeping her in the dark. To Jones it would be impossible that she should apply; but from Robinson she might succeed in obtaining his secret. She had heard, no doubt, of Samson and Delilah, and thought she knew the way to the strong man\u0027s locks. And might it not be well for her to forget that other Samson, and once more to trust herself to her father\u0027s partner? When she weighed the two young tradesmen one against the other, balancing their claims with such judgment as she possessed, she doubted much as to her choice. She thought that she might be happy with either;—but then it was necessary that the other dear charmer should be away. As to Robinson, he would marry her, she knew, at once, without any stipulations. As to Brisket,—if Brisket should be her ultimate choice,—it would be necessary that she should either worry her father out of the money, or else cheat her lover into the belief that the money would be forthcoming. Having taken all these circumstances into consideration, she invited Mr. Robinson to tea. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Brown was there, of course, and so also were Mr. and Mrs. Poppins. When Robinson entered, they were already at the tea-table, and the great demerits of Johnson of Manchester were under discussion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now Mr. Robinson will tell us everything,\" said Mrs. Poppins. \"It\u0027s about Johnson, you know. Where has he gone to, Mr. Robinson?\" But Robinson professed that he did not know. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He knows well enough,\" said Maryanne, \"only he\u0027s so close. Now do tell us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027ll tell you anything you choose to ask him,\" said Mrs. Poppins. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell me anything! Not him, indeed. What does he care for me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure he would if he only knew what you were saying before he came into the room.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now don\u0027t, Polly!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, but I shall! because it\u0027s better he should know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, Polly, if you don\u0027t hold your tongue, I\u0027ll be angry! Mr. Robinson is nothing to me, and never will be, I\u0027m sure. Only if he\u0027d do me the favour, as a friend, to tell us about Mr. Johnson, I\u0027d take it kind of him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In the meantime Mr. Brown and his young married guest were discussing things commercial on their own side of the room, and Poppins, also, was not without a hope that he might learn the secret. Poppins had rather despised the firm at first, as not a few others had done, distrusting all their earlier assurances as to trade bargains, and having been even unmoved by the men in armour. But the great affair of Johnson of Manchester had overcome even his doubts, and he began to feel that it was a privilege to be noticed by the senior partner in a house which could play such a game as that. It was not that Poppins believed in Johnson, or that he thought that 15,000l. of paper had at any time been missing. But, nevertheless, the proceeding had affected his mind favourably with reference to Brown, Jones, and Robinson, and brought it about that he now respected them,—and, perhaps, feared them a little, though he had not respected or feared them heretofore. Had he been the possessor of a wholesale house of business, he would not now have dared to refuse them goods on credit, though he would have done so before Johnson of Manchester had become known to the world. It may therefore be surmised that George Robinson had been right, and that he had understood the ways of British trade when he composed the Johnsonian drama. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed, I\u0027d rather not, Mr. Poppins,\" said Mr. Brown. \"Secrets in trade should be secrets. And though Mr. Johnson has done us a deal of mischief, we don\u0027t want to expose him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you\u0027ve been exposing him ever so long,\" pleaded Poppins. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now Poppins,\" said that gentleman\u0027s wife, \"don\u0027t you be troubling Mr. Brown. He\u0027s got other things to think of than answering your questions. I should like to know myself, I own, because all the town\u0027s talking about it. And it does seem odd to me that Maryanne shouldn\u0027t know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t, then,\" said Maryanne. \"And I do think when a lady asks a gentleman, the least thing a gentleman can do is to tell. But I shan\u0027t ask no more,—not of Mr. Robinson. I was thinking—. But never mind, Polly. Perhaps it\u0027s best as it is.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Would you have me betray my trust?\" said Robinson. \"Would you esteem me the more because I had deceived my partners? If you think that I am to earn your love in that way, you know but little of George Robinson.\" Then he got up, preparing to leave the room, for his feelings were too many for him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stop, George, stop,\" said Mr. Brown. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let him go,\" said Maryanne. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If he goes away now I shall think him as hard as Adam,\" said Mrs. Poppins. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s three to one again him,\" said Mr. Poppins to himself. \"What chance can he have?\" Mr. Poppins may probably have gone through some such phase of life himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let him go,\" said Maryanne again. \"I wish he would. And then let him never show himself here again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"George Robinson, my son, my son!\" exclaimed the old man. \\n\\n \\n\\n It must be understood that Robinson had heard all this, though he had left the room. Indeed, it may be surmised that had he been out of hearing the words would not have been spoken. He heard them, for he was still standing immediately beyond the door, and was irresolute whether he would depart or whether he would return. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"George Robinson, my son, my son!\" exclaimed the old man again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He shall come back!\" said Mrs. Poppins, following him out of the door. \"He shall come back, though I have to carry him myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Polly,\" said Maryanne, \"if you so much as whisper a word to ask him, I\u0027ll never speak to you the longest day you have to live.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But the threat was thrown away upon Mrs. Poppins, and, under her auspices, Robinson was brought back into the room. \"Maryanne,\" said he, \"will you renounce William Brisket?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Laws, George!\" said she. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course she will,\" said Mrs. Poppins, \"and all the pomps and vanities besides.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My son, my son!\" said old Brown, lifting up both his hands. \"My daughter, my daughter! My children, my children!\" And then he joined their hands together and blessed them. \\n\\n \\n\\n He blessed them, and then went down into the shop. But before the evening was over, Delilah had shorn Samson of his locks. \"And so there wasn\u0027t any Johnson after all,\" said she. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Robinson, as he returned home, walked again upon roses. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2752/75853.html","bookId":1350,"book":{"id":1350,"title":"The Struggles of Brown, Jones, and Robinson","description":"简介： It will be observed by the literary and commercial world that, in this transaction, the name of the really responsible party does not show on the title-page.
