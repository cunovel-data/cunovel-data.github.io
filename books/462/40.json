{"id":18943,"no":40,"title":"CHAPTER XL. THE BRACKETTS ARE CHECKMATED.","content":"Mr. and Mrs. Brackett got home about four o’clock. They had been talking over the proposal to pay White a hundred dollars cash,{238} but had not been able to make up their minds to do it. In fact, paying out ready money seemed as bad to Mrs. Brackett—whose mean, parsimonious disposition has already been referred to—as having a tooth drawn. Indeed, I may say, confidentially, that she would have preferred to lose half a dozen teeth rather than part with a hundred dollars. “We’ll put George off,” she said to her husband, as they were riding home. “We’ll pretend that we are trying to raise the money, but can’t do it. Perhaps he will get impatient and agree to take less. A hundred dollars is an outrageous price for such a small job.” “So I think, Lucindy,” chimed in her husband. “Really your brother seems to me very grasping.” “So he is, and very extravagant besides. He could squander more money in a week than we could lay by in six months.” Of course they would not have dared to discuss the subject in presence of the children; but they had been left behind, with the exception of the youngest, two years of age, to spend the afternoon with some juvenile companions. “It’s lucky George doesn’t know about our account in the savings bank, Lucindy.” “If he knew of that, it would be impossible to get rid of paying the money.” “Suppose he won’t give up the will without the whole amount down?” “He will. It will do him no good, and if he keeps it or destroys it he won’t get a cent. I{239} know he needs money, for he told me the other day that he was reduced to his last five dollars. If we remain firm, he’ll come to our terms.” Mrs. Brackett spoke confidently, and felt so, but it was not long before she found occasion to reverse her opinion of her brother. They found him smoking a pipe on the lawn, or grass plat, near the back door. “Had a pleasant ride?” he asked, lazily. “Yes, George,” said his sister. “What have you been doing?” “Oh, killing time!” he answered, indifferently. “I have been thinking, Lucinda, that I should have to leave you very soon.” “You mustn’t hurry,” said Mrs. Brackett; but she felt glad to hear that her brother was likely to leave her soon. She did not relish having a free boarder, even if he were her own brother, and, besides, judged that they could drive a better bargain with him in that case. “Oh, I didn’t expect to stay here very long,” said White. “But I can’t go without that hundred dollars.” “Really, George, you can’t be aware how hard it is to raise money,” said his brother-in-law. “Oh, yes, I can!” said George, smiling. “I find it deuced uphill work myself,” and he glanced knowingly at Mr. Brackett. “I mean that I find it hard to raise it for you. You see, a hundred dollars is a large sum. If you’d be willing now to take twenty-five and the balance in installments—or, better{240} still, when we come into our money—I think I could arrange it.” “My dear brother-in-law,” said White, with a smile, “you do it well—very well, indeed. If I hadn’t been round the world a little, I dare say I should be taken in, and accept your statement for gospel.” “I hope you don’t think my husband would deceive you, George,” said his sister, with dignity. “Oh, of course not! Still, I find it is the general custom to look out for number one.” “You always looked out for number one, George,” said his sister, bluntly. “Yes I flatter myself I did; but to return to business. You seem to be at a loss to know where you can raise the hundred dollars, to which I am entitled for my services.” “You are right there.” “Then I will tell you where you can find it.” “I wish you would,” said Brackett, by no means prepared for the reply that awaited him. “It was simple enough, Jeremiah. Draw it out of the savings bank. You will have four hundred dollars left.” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2952/81184.html","bookId":462,"book":{"id":462,"title":"Andy Gordon The Fortunes of A Young Janitor","description":"简介： The Hamilton Academy, under the charge of Rev.
