She liked what she’d seen of Carrie—but what about Natalie? Well, that was Vaughn’s business, she reminded herself again.\n Hassie led her into the living room. “I hope you don’t mind, but I’ve already poured the tea.”\n “Not at all.”\n The silver service was set up on the coffee table and two delicate china cups were neatly positioned, steam rising from the recently poured tea. A plate of cookies had been placed nearby.\n “I don’t often get an excuse to use my good tea service and china these days,” Hassie murmured.\n The two women sat side by side on the dark-blue sofa and sipped their tea. Neither really knew where to start, Barbara reflected. She took a deep breath.\n “I’ve thought of you often,” she said. “Especially since you were so generous with our son.”\n “He must have thought me a silly old woman, writing him little tidbits of advice.”\n “Hassie,” Barbara said, and touched Hassie’s forearm. “No one could think that.” She shook her head. “He saved every birthday card you ever sent him. And he remembered what you wrote. He grew up honorable and generous, and I can’t help thinking you played a part in that.”\n Hassie smiled her appreciation. “Nonsense, but it’s very kind of you to say so.”\n Barbara glanced around the room. “Being here brings back so many memories,” she said. The house, this room, was exactly as she remembered. She suspected that even after all these years, Vaughn’s bedroom was virtually untouched. She remembered the high-school banner he had pinned to the wall and the bedroom set, old-fashioned even then. Valerie’s old room was probably the same as it had been, as well, just like the rest of this house.\n Hassie didn’t comment, and Barbara sensed that the older woman had hung on to the past as much as she could and found comfort in what was familiar. Hassie’s strength was considerable, but her loss had been too great. Losses, Barbara recalled. Jerry had died not long afterward, and Valerie had moved to Hawaii.\n “Do you like living in Grand Forks?” Hassie asked, turning away from reminders of grief.\n “Very much. My parents leased out the house when they moved to Arizona. Rick and I always intended to move here one day, and I’m really happy we did. This will be our first Christmas in North Dakota since Vaughn was five or six.”\n “With family again.”\n “Actually, there’ll only be Rick, Vaughn and me. All my family has moved away, and Gloria, our daughter, lives in Dallas.”\n “Have Christmas here with me,” Hassie urged, and then as if she regretted the impulse, she shook her head. “No, please forget I asked. I’m sorry to impose. It’s just the rambling of an old woman.”\n “Hassie, if you’re serious, we’d love nothing better than to spend the day with you.”\n Hassie’s eyes shone. “You mean you’d actually consider coming?”\n “We’d be honored. I know Rick would love to see you again. He wanted to join me today, but he was already committed to something else—some volunteer work he’s doing.”\n “You’re sure about Christmas?”\n “Very sure,” Barbara insisted. “But I can’t allow you to do all the cooking.”\n “Oh,” Hassie said, “it’s no problem. I’d enjoy preparing my favorite recipes.”\n “We’ll share the meal preparation, then,” Barbara compromised, and Hassie aggreed.\n “We’ll be having Christmas dinner,” Barbara murmured, “with a dear, dear friend.”\n “I can’t think of anything I’d enjoy more.”\n Barbara couldn’t, either.\n Chapter 5\n Carrie found Leta tending Knight’s Pharmacy when she arrived after saying goodbye to Vaughn and his mother.\n “Thanks for filling in for me,” she said, hurrying to the back of the store. She stored her coat and purse and pulled on her white jacket.\n “I don’t mind staying,” Leta told her. “In fact, Hassie asked me if I would. She thought you and Vaughn might like a few hours together.” Leta wiped down the counter, and Carrie noticed how the other woman’s eyes managed to evade hers.\n “Aren’t you two being just a little obvious?” she teased.\n “Perhaps,” Leta said, “but we both think it’s high time you got into circulation again.”\n “Like a library book?” Carrie said with a grin. “I’ve been on the shelf too long?”\n “Laugh if you want, but it’s true. You’ve been avoiding a social life. That’s not good for a woman of your age.”\n Carrie was about to explain that, while she appreciated their efforts, she’d already spent time with Vaughn. Before she could, though, the bell above the door chimed, and Lindsay Sinclair and her two daughters stepped into the warmth of the pharmacy.\n “Grandma.” Four-year-old Joy ran toward Leta, who scooped the girl up in her arms for an enthusiastic hug.\n “I’ve had the most incredible morning,” Lindsay announced.\n “Value-X?” Carrie asked.\n Lindsay nodded. “The spokeswoman actually phoned me back.”\n “She called you?” Leta asked, voice incredulous, as she set Joy back on the floor.\n “Yes, and for some reason, she seemed to view me as a contact who represented the community. That’s fine, since everyone in town shares my opinion.” Lindsay removed her hat and shook out her hair. “She wanted me to understand that Value-X intends to be a good neighbor, quote, unquote.”\n “Yeah, right!” Carrie muttered sarcastically.\n “I’ll just bet,” Leta added. “They assume we’re nothing but a bunch of dumb hicks.”\n “To be fair,” Lindsay said, glancing between the other two women, “we don’t know what they think of us—not that we have any interest in their opinion. But we are fully capable of mounting a campaign to keep them out.”\n “I was thinking the same thing,” Carrie said.\n “Organization is the key,” Leta put in.\n “You’ll be at the Cookie Exchange tonight, won’t you?” Lindsay asked Carrie. “I know Leta will.” She smiled at her mother-in-law. “I thought that would be the best time to get all the women together. We can talk then.”\n “Good idea. Mom and I will be there for sure.” The women’s group at the church held the cookie exchange every Christmas. Joyce Dawson, the pastor’s wife, had been instrumental in organizing the event, and every woman in town and the surrounding community could be counted on to attend.\n “Value-X won’t know what hit them,” Leta said happily.\n The bell chimed a second time, and Vaughn entered the store. For a moment, he seemed startled to see the three women, but then his gaze sought out Carrie’s. “Should I come back later?”\n “Not at all,” Leta said. “There’s no need for Carrie to work today. I’ve got everything covered.”\n Carrie was grateful for what her friends were trying to do, but she did have responsibilities. Leta seemed to read her thoughts. “If any prescriptions get phoned in, I’ll find you,” she promised. “I’ll leave a message with your mom.”\n “Ever hear the expression about not looking a gift horse in the mouth?” Lindsay whispered.\n “Well, it appears I’m not wanted or needed around here,” Carrie said before Leta and Hassie’s intentions became any plainer than they already were. She walked past Lindsay, who winked at her. After collecting her coat and purse, Carrie left with Vaughn.\n “Where would you like to go?” he asked as soon as they were outside.\n She hadn’t had lunch yet and suspected Vaughn hadn’t, either. “I know we had Italian yesterday, but I love pizza.”\n “Me, too.”\n “Buffalo Valley has some of the best homemade pizza you’ll ever eat.”\n He lifted his eyebrows. “Sounds good to me.”\n They started down the street, their pace relaxed. Snow had just begun to fall, drifting earthward in large, soft flakes. Christmas-card snow, Carrie thought. As they walked, she told him the story about Rachel’s pizza, and how it had led to her restaurant and subsequent success.\n “You mean she makes the sauce herself?”\n Carrie nodded. “I worked for Rachel one summer and I watched her make a batch. She starts with fresh tomatoes straight from her garden. It’s amazingly good. I think she could sell her recipe, but of course, she doesn’t want to.”\n A pickup approached and slowed as it came alongside Vaughn and Carrie. Glancing over her shoulder, Carrie saw her two older brothers, Tom and Pete. She tried to ignore them, but that was impossible.\n “Hey, Carrie,” Tom called, leaning his elbow out the open passenger window.\n She acknowledged his greeting with a short wave, hoping he’d simply move on. Not that this was likely. Apparently Chuck and Ken had mentioned Vaughn, and now they, too, were looking for an introduction.\n “Don’t you want us to meet your friend?”\n “Not right now,” she called back, and sent Vaughn an apologetic glance. Because she was the only girl, all four of her brothers were protective of her, even more so after her divorce.\n “You ashamed of your family?” This came from Pete, who was driving.\n Carrie sighed, praying that her brothers wouldn’t say or do anything to further embarrass her. Pete parked the truck and both men climbed out, slamming their doors extra hard. Both wore thick winter coats and wool caps with the earflaps dangling. They were large men and did their best to appear intimidating.\n She made the introductions, gesturing weakly toward her brothers. Vaughn stepped forward and shook hands with both of them.\n “Nice to finally meet you,” Tom said, resting his foot on the truck’s bumper. “Now I’d like to know what your intentions are toward my sister.”\n “Tom!” Furious, Carrie clenched her fists. “This is none of your business.”\n “The day you stop being my sister is the day I stop caring who you date.”\n “Well…” Vaughn clearly had no idea what to say.\n Her brothers putting him on the spot like this was outrageous. Picking up a handful of snow, Carrie immediately formed a ball and threw it at her oldest brother, hitting him square in the chest. Not waiting for his reaction, Carrie grabbed Vaughn’s arm and shouted, “Run!”\n “You asked for this, Carrie Ann,” Tom shouted as Carrie and Vaughn raced across the street. They had just entered the park when Carrie felt her backside pelted by two snowballs.\n “This is war,” Vaughn yelled when he saw that she’d been hit. He leaned down and packed his own snow, then hurled two balls in quick succession, hitting both Pete and Tom. Her brothers reacted with stunned surprise.\n Laughing and dodging around the play equipment with her brothers in hot pursuit, Carrie had trouble keeping pace with Vaughn. He yelled instructions and pointed toward the back of Hamburger Heaven. The stand was closed for the winter and offered ample protection, but a few moments later, her brothers found them and began to bombard them with a flurry of snowballs. Although most of them hit the side of the building, it was obvious that Vaughn and Carrie couldn’t stay there long. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/buffalo-valley/page-12.html","bookId":1965,"book":{"id":1965,"title":"Buffalo Valley","description":"Storyline: \n Buffalo Valley (Dakota #4) \n In this charming volume, Buffalo Valley faces a new challenge.
