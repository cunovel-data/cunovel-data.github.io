{"id":23140,"no":32,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII. MR. DENTON OF CHICAGO.","content":"I N due time, Nicholas Bundy and Oliver arrived at Chicago. They took up their residence at a small hotel, and Mr. Bundy prepared to search for some trace of Rupert Jones. He couldn\u0027t find the name in the directory, but after diligent search ascertained that such a man had been in business in Chicago ten years before. Where he went or what became of him could not immediately be learned. Time was required, and it became necessary to prolong their stay in the city. Mr. Bundy did not care to make acquaintances. With Oliver he was not lonely. But one evening, while sitting in the public room, a stranger entered into conversation with him. \"My dear sir,\" he said to Mr. Bundy, \"I perceive that you smoke. Won\u0027t you oblige me by accepting one of my cigars? I flatter myself that you will find it superior to the one you are smoking.\" If there was one thing that Nicholas Bundy enjoyed it was a good cigar. \"Thank you, sir,\" he said. \"You are very obliging.\" \"Oh, don\u0027t mention it,\" said the other. \"The fact is I am rather an enthusiast on the subject of cigars. I would like your opinion of this one.\" Nicholas took the proffered cigar and lighted it. He was sufficient of a judge to see that it was really superior, and his manner became almost genial toward the stranger who had procured him this pleasure. \"It is capital,\" he said. \"Where can I get more like it?\" \"Oh, I\u0027ll undertake that,\" said the other. \"How many would you like?\" \"A hundred to begin with.\" \"You shall have them. By the way, do you remain long in the city?\" \"I can\u0027t tell. It depends upon my business.\" \"Why do you stay at a hotel? You would find a boarding-house more comfortable and cheaper.\" \"Do you know of a good one?\" \"I can recommend the one where I am myself living. There is a chamber next to my own that is vacant, if you would like to look at it.\" The proposal struck Nicholas favorably and he agreed to accompany his new acquaintance the next morning to look at it. The house was one of fair appearance, with a tolerably good location. The chamber referred to by Denton (this was the stranger\u0027s name) was superior to the room in the hotel, while the terms were more reasonable. \"What do you say, Oliver?\" asked Mr. Bundy. \"Shall we remove here?\" \"Just as you like, sir. It seems a very pleasant room.\" The landlady was seen, and the arrangement was made for an immediate removal. She was a woman of middle age, bland in her manners, but there was something shifty and evasive in her eyes not calculated to inspire confidence. Neither Nicholas nor Oliver thought much of this at the time, though it occurred to them afterward. \"You\u0027ll find her a good landlady,\" said Denton, who seemed pleased at the success of the negotiations. \"I have been here over a year, and I have never had anything to complain of. The table is excellent.\" \"I am not likely to find fault with it,\" said Nicholas. \"I\u0027ve roughed it a good deal in my time, and I aint much used to luxury. If I get a comfortable bed, and good plain victuals, it\u0027s enough for me.\" \"So you\u0027ve been a rolling stone, Mr. Bundy,\" said the stranger enquiringly. \"Yes, I have wandered about the world more or less.\" \"They say \u0027a rolling stone gathers no moss,\u0027\" continued Mr. Denton. \"I hope you have gathered enough to retire upon.\" \"I have got enough to see me through,\" said Nicholas quietly. \"So have I,\" said Denton. \"Queer coincidence, isn\u0027t it? When I was fifteen years old I hadn\u0027t a cent, and being without shoes I had to go barefoot. Now I\u0027ve got enough to see me through. Do you see that ring?\" displaying at the same time a ring with an immense colorless stone. \"It\u0027s worth a cool thousand,—genuine diamond, in fact,—and I am able to wear it. Whenever I get hard up—though there\u0027s no fear of that—I have that to fall back upon.\" Nicholas examined the ring briefly. \"I never took a fancy to such things,\" he said quietly. \"I\u0027d as soon have a piece of glass, as far as looks go.\" \"You\u0027re right,\" said Denton. \"But I have a weakness for diamonds. They are a good investment, too. This ring is worth two hundred dollars more than I gave for it.\" \"Is it?\" asked Nicholas. \"Well, all have their tastes. I\u0027d rather have what the ring cost in gold or Government bonds.\" Denton laughed. \"I see you are a plain man with plain tastes,\" he said. \"Well, it takes all sorts of men to make a world, and I don\u0027t mind confessing that I like show.\" The same day they moved into the boarding-house. It was arranged that Oliver, as before, should occupy the same room with his new guardian, and for his use a small extra bed was put in. \"We are next-door neighbors,\" said Denton, \"I hope you won\u0027t find me an unpleasant neighbor. The fact is, I sleep like a top all night. Never know anything from the minute I lie down till it\u0027s time to get up. Are you gentlemen good sleepers?\" \"I sleep well,\" said Nicholas. \"It\u0027s with me very much as it is with you.\" \"Of course you sleep well, my young friend,\" said the new acquaintance to Oliver. \"Boys of your age ought not to wake up during the night.\" \"I believe I am a pretty good sleeper,\" said Oliver. \"Why is he so particular about enquiring whether we sleep well?\" thought our hero. He was not particularly inclined to suspicion, but somehow he had never liked Mr. Denton. The man\u0027s manner was hearty and cordial, but there was a sly, searching, crafty look which Oliver had occasionally detected, which set him to thinking. Not so with Nicholas. He had seen much of men\u0027s treachery, he had suffered much from it also, but at heart he was disposed to judge favorably of his fellow-men, except where he had special reason to know that they were unreliable. \"Our neighbor seems very obliging,\" he said to Oliver, after Denton had left the room. \"Yes, sir,\" answered Oliver. \"I wonder why I don\u0027t like him.\" \"Don\u0027t like him!\" repeated. Nicholas in surprise. \"No. I can\u0027t seem to trust him.\" \"He appears pleasant enough,\" said Mr. Bundy. \"A little vain, perhaps, or he wouldn\u0027t wear a thousand dollars on his finger. There wouldn\u0027t be many diamonds sold if all were like me.\" \"I wonder what his business is?\" \"He has never told me. From what he says he probably lives upon his means.\" Oliver did not continue the conversation. Very likely his distrust was undeserved by the man who inspired it, and he did not feel justified in trying to prejudice Mr. Bundy against him. Finding Nicholas was tired in the evening, Oliver went out after supper by himself. He was naturally drawn to the more brilliantly lighted streets, which, even at ten o\u0027clock in the evening, were gay with foot passengers. Sauntering along, he found himself walking behind two gentlemen, and could not avoid hearing their conversation. \"Do you see that man in front of us?\" asked one. \"The one with the diamond ring?\" for the stone sparkled in the light. \"Yes; he is the one I mean.\" \"What of him?\" \"He is one of the most notorious gamblers and confidence men in Chicago.\" \"Indeed! What is his name?\" \"He has several—Denton, Forbes, Cranmer, and half a dozen others.\" Naturally Oliver\u0027s curiosity was excited by what he heard. Passing the speakers, he scanned the man of whom they had been conversing. It was Denton—the man who had been so friendly to Nicholas Bundy and himself. \"I was right in distrusting him,\" he thought. \"He is a dangerous man. Now, what shall I do?\" Oliver decided not to tell Mr. Bundy immediately of what he had heard; but, for his own part, he decided to watch carefully, lest Denton might attempt in any way to injure them.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2088/59239.html","bookId":527,"book":{"id":527,"title":"Adrift in The City or Oliver Conrad\u0027s Plucky Fight","description":"简介： The speaker, a boy of sixteen, stood on the lawn before a handsome country mansion.
