{"id":23132,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. ANOTHER CLUE.","content":"N ICHOLAS BUNDY was disappointed by his first failure, but by no means discouraged. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There are many Joneses in the world,\" he said, \"but Rupert is an uncommon name. I didn\u0027t think there\u0027d be more than one with that handle to his name. If he\u0027s alive I\u0027ll find him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you enquire of somebody that knew him?\" asked Oliver. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The thing is to find such a one,\" said Bundy. \"There\u0027s been many changes in twenty years.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you know of some tradesman that he used to patronize, Mr. Bundy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The very thing!\" exclaimed the miner, for so I shall sometimes designate Mr. Bundy. \"There\u0027s one man that may tell me about him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who is that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He kept a drinking-place down near Fulton Ferry. He may be living yet. I\u0027ll go and see him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So one morning Nicholas Bundy, accompanied by Oliver, took the Third Avenue cars and went downtown. They got out near the Astor House, and made their way to the old place, which Bundy remembered well. To his great joy he found it—a little shabbier, a little dirtier, but in other respects the same. \\n\\n \\n\\n They entered. Behind the bar stood a man of nearly sixty, whose bloated figure and dull red face indicated that he appreciated what he sold to others. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What will you have, gentlemen?\" he asked briskly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Nicholas Bundy surveyed his countenance attentively. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you Jacob Spratt?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" answered the bartender. \"Do you know me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I knew you twenty years ago,\" answered the miner. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t remember you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You once knew me well.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have seen many faces in my time. I can\u0027t remember so many years back.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you recall the name of Nicholas Bundy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ay, that I do. You used to come here with a man named Jones.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes—Rupert Jones. Can you tell me where he is now?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jacob shook his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He left New York not long after you did,\" he answered. \"He went to Chicago.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are you sure of that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, and I\u0027ll tell you why. He came here one evening and says: \u0027Jacob, I\u0027m going away. You won\u0027t see me for a long time—I\u0027m going to Chicago.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did he tell you why he was going there?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He said he was going there as an agent for a New York house—that he had a good chance.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You have never seen him since?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said Jacob. Then he added meditatively: \"Once I thought I saw him. There was a man I met in the street looking as like him as two peas, makin\u0027 allowance for the years he was older. I went up to him and called him by name, but he colored up and looked annoyed, and told me I was quite mistaken; that his name wasn\u0027t Jones, but something else—I don\u0027t remember what now. Of course I axed his pardon and walked on, but he was the very picture of Rupert Jones.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you feel sure that he went to Chicago?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, he told me so, and that was the last time I saw him. If he had stayed in the city he would have kept on comin\u0027 to my place, or I should have met him somewhere.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Nicholas Bundy thanked the old man for his information, and ordered glasses of lemonade for himself and Oliver. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Won\u0027t you have something stronger, Mr. Bundy?\" asked the barkeeper insinuatingly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bundy shook his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve given up liquor,\" he said. \"I\u0027m better off without it, and so will the boy be. What do you say, Oliver?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I agree with you, sir,\" said Oliver promptly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lucky for me all don\u0027t think so,\" said Spratt. \"It \u0027ould ruin my business.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When they left the bar-room Nicholas Bundy turned to his young companion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oliver,\" he said, \"will you go with me to Chicago?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall be glad to go,\" said Oliver promptly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then we will start in two or three days, as soon as I have made some business arrangements.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Bundy,\" said Oliver honestly, \"it will cost you considerable to pay my expenses. I should like very much to go, but do you think it will pay you to take me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re considerate, boy, but don\u0027t trouble yourself about that. You are company to me, and I\u0027m willing to pay your expenses for that, let alone the help you may give me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, Mr. Bundy. Then I will say no more. What day do you think you will start?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To-day is Tuesday. We will start on Saturday. Can you be ready?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Oliver laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There won\u0027t be much getting ready for me,\" he said. \"All my business arrangements can be made in half an hour.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bundy smiled. Our hero\u0027s good spirits seemed to enliven his own. He was not only getting used to Oliver\u0027s company, but sincerely attached to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2088/59231.html","bookId":527,"book":{"id":527,"title":"Adrift in The City or Oliver Conrad\u0027s Plucky Fight","description":"简介： The speaker, a boy of sixteen, stood on the lawn before a handsome country mansion.
