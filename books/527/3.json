{"id":23111,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III. THE YOUNG RIVALS.","content":"W HEN Oliver left the house he was uncertain whither to bend his steps. The supper hour was near at hand, but it would hardly be pleasant under the circumstances to meet his step-father and Roland at the tea-table. He preferred to go without his evening meal. \\n\\n \\n\\n As he walked slowly along the main street on which his step-father\u0027s house was situated, plunged in thought, he was called to himself by a slap on his shoulder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are you thinking about, Oliver?\" was asked, in a cheery voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Frank Dudley!\" said our hero, \"you\u0027re just the boy I want to see.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do I owe you any money?\" asked Frank, in mock alarm. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not that I know of.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then it\u0027s all right. I am glad to meet you, too. Where are you going?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have you had supper?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then come home with me. You haven\u0027t taken supper at our house for a long time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So I will,\" responded Oliver with alacrity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see how it is,\" said Frank. \"They were going to send you to bed without your supper, and my invitation brings you unexpected relief.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are partly right. But for your invitation I should have had no supper.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is it all about, Oliver? What\u0027s the matter?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you, Frank. Mr. Kenyon and I have had a quarrel.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am not surprised at that. I don\u0027t admire the man, even if he is your step-father.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, you needn\u0027t check your feelings on my account. I never could like him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did the trouble begin?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It began with Roland. I\u0027ll tell you about it,\" and Oliver told what had occurred. \\n\\n \\n\\n Frank listened in silence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think you did right,\" he said. \"I wouldn\u0027t submit to be ordered round by such a popinjay. He\u0027s the most disagreeable boy I know, and my sister thinks so, too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He seems to admire your sister.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She doesn\u0027t appreciate his attentions. He\u0027s always coming up and wanting to walk with her, though she is cool enough with him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Oliver was glad to hear this. To tell the truth, he had a boyish fancy for Carrie Dudley himself, which was not surprising, for she was the prettiest girl in the village. Though he had not supposed she looked favorably upon Roland, it was pleasant to be assured of this by the young lady\u0027s brother. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Poor Roland!\" he said, smiling. \"Your sister may give him the heartache.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I guess his heart\u0027s pretty tough. But here we are.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Frank Dudley\u0027s father was a successful physician. His mother was dead, and her place in the household was supplied by his father\u0027s sister, Miss Pauline Dudley, who, though an old maid, had a sunny temperament and kindly disposition. The doctor\u0027s house, though not as pretentious as Mr. Kenyon\u0027s, was unusually pleasant and attractive. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aunt Pauline,\" said Frank to his aunt, who was sitting on a rocking chair on the front piazza, \"I have brought Oliver home to supper.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am very glad to see you, Oliver,\" said Miss Dudley. \"I wish you would come oftener.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, Miss Dudley; I am always glad to come here. It is so pleasant and social compared with――\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He paused, thinking it not in good taste to refer unfavorably to his own home. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I understand,\" said Miss Dudley. \"You must be lonely at home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am,\" said Oliver briefly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not much company, and that poor,\" whispered Frank. \\n\\n \\n\\n Oliver nodded assent. \\n\\n \\n\\n Here Carrie Dudley appeared and cordially welcomed Oliver. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Carrie seems glad to see you, Oliver,\" said Frank; \"but you must not feel too much elated. It\u0027s only on account of your relationship to Roland. She\u0027s perfectly infatuated with that boy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Like most brothers, Frank liked to tease his sister. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Roland!\" repeated Carrie, tossing her head. \"I hope I have better taste than to like him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s all put on, Oliver. You mustn\u0027t believe what she says.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t I see Roland walking with you yesterday?\" asked Oliver, willing to join in the teasing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because I couldn\u0027t get rid of him,\" retorted Carrie. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He thinks you are over head and ears in love with him,\" said Frank. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t believe he thinks anything of the kind. If he does, he is very much mistaken; that is all I can say.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tease your sister any more, Frank,\" said Oliver. \"I don\u0027t believe she admires Roland any more than I do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, Oliver. I am glad to have you on my side,\" said the young lady graciously. \"I shouldn\u0027t mind if I never saw Roland Kenyon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stop your quarrelling, young people, and walk in to supper,\" said Miss Pauline. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where is your father to-night, Frank?\" asked Oliver, as they ranged themselves round the neat supper table. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He has been sent for to Claremont. He won\u0027t be back till late, probably. You will please look upon me as the head of the household while he is away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will, most learned doctor.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The evening meal passed pleasantly. Oliver could not help contrasting it with the dull and formal supper he was accustomed to take at home, and his thoughts found utterance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wish I had as pleasant a home as you, Frank.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You had better come and live with us, Oliver.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should like to.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Suppose you propose it to Mr. Kenyon. I don\u0027t believe he prizes your society very much.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nor I. He wouldn\u0027t mind being rid of me, but Roland would probably object to my coming here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t think of that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should like to have you with us, Oliver,\" said Miss Pauline. \"You would be company for Frank, and could help keep him straight.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As if I needed it, Aunt Pauline! All the same, I should enjoy having Oliver here, and so would Carrie.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I should,\" said the young lady unhesitatingly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Oliver was well pleased, and expressed his satisfaction. \\n\\n \\n\\n After supper they adjourned to the parlor, and presently Carrie sat down to the piano and played and sang some popular songs, Frank and Oliver joining in the singing. \\n\\n \\n\\n While they were thus engaged a ring was heard at the door-bell. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s Roland, I\u0027ll bet a hat,\" said Frank. \"It\u0027s one of his courting evenings.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It proved to be Roland. \\n\\n \\n\\n He entered with a stiff bow. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good-evening, Miss Carrie,\" he said, a little awkwardly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good-evening, Mr. Kenyon,\" said the young lady distantly. \"Will you be seated?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you. Good-evening, Frank.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good-evening. May I introduce you to Mr. Oliver Conrad?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You here?\" said Roland, surprised. \\n\\n \\n\\n Being near-sighted, he had not before noticed our hero\u0027s presence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am here,\" said Oliver briefly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We were singing as you entered, Roland,\" said Frank mischievously. \"Won\u0027t you favor us with a melody?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t sing,\" said Roland stiffly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed! Oliver is quite a singer.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was not aware he was so accomplished,\" said Roland, unable to suppress a sneer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose he doesn\u0027t often sing to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shouldn\u0027t like to trouble him. I should be very glad to hear you sing, Miss Carrie.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If Frank and Oliver will join in. I don\u0027t like to sing alone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A song was selected, and the three sang it through. Sitting at the other end of the room, Roland, who greatly admired Carrie, was tormented with jealousy as he saw Oliver at her side, winning smiles and attention which he had never been able to win. He could not help wishing that he, too, were able to sing. If Oliver had made himself ridiculous, it would have comforted him, but our hero had a strong and musical voice, and acquitted himself very creditably. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a pity you don\u0027t sing, Roland,\" said Frank. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t try to sing unless I could sing well,\" said Roland. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is he hitting you or me, Oliver?\" asked Frank. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You sing well,\" said Roland. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then it\u0027s you, Oliver!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Oliver smiled, but took no notice of the remark. \\n\\n \\n\\n Roland rose to go a little after nine. He had not enjoyed the evening. It was very unsatisfactory to see the favor with which his enemy was regarded by Carrie Dudley. He had not the art to conceal his dislike of our hero. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027d better come home,\" he said, turning to Oliver. \"Father objects to our being out late.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know when to come home,\" said Oliver briefly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027d better ask leave before you go out to supper again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you have no more to say I will bid you good-evening,\" said Oliver quietly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You see what a pleasant brother I have,\" said Oliver after Roland\u0027s departure. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a good thing to have somebody to look after you,\" said Carrie. \"I wish Frank had such a guardian and guide.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall have, when Roland is my brother-in-law,\" retorted Frank. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you\u0027ll have to go without one forever.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Girls never say what they mean, Oliver.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sometimes they do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile Roland was trudging home in no very good humor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027d give fifty dollars to see Oliver well thrashed,\" he muttered. \"He is interfering with me in everything.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2088/59210.html","bookId":527,"book":{"id":527,"title":"Adrift in The City or Oliver Conrad\u0027s Plucky Fight","description":"简介： The speaker, a boy of sixteen, stood on the lawn before a handsome country mansion.
