{"id":23126,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. OLIVER, THE OUTCAST.","content":"W ITHOUT much hope of obtaining sympathy or credence, Oliver wrote to his step-father an account of the charge which Mr. Bond had brought against him, and denied in the most positive terms its truth. \"There,\" he said to himself as he posted the letter, \"that is all I can do. Mr. Kenyon must now decide which he will believe.\" Until he should hear from his step-father he decided not to form any plans for the future. One thing he was decided upon, not to return home. Since his mother\u0027s death (for he supposed her dead) it was no home for him. He had been in the city long enough to become fond of city life, and he meant to remain there. If Mr. Kenyon chose to assist him to procure another situation, he would accept his proffered aid, otherwise he would try to earn his own living. Two days later he received a letter, which he at once perceived to be in his step-father\u0027s handwriting. He tore it open eagerly and began to read. His lip curled with scorn before he had read far. These were the material portions of the letter: The same mail brought me letters from you and Mr. Bond. I need not say how grieved I am to hear that you have subjected yourself to a criminal charge. The circumstances leave no doubt of your guilt. Unhappy boy! how, with the liberal allowance you received, could you stoop to so mean, so dishonorable a theft? My nephew writes me that with brazen effrontery you denied your guilt, though it was self-evident, and treated his remonstrances with the most outrageous insolence. It is well, indeed, that your poor mother did not live to see this day. \"How dare he refer to my mother!\" exclaimed Oliver indignantly, when he came to this passage. He went on with the letter: I didn\u0027t expect that my well-meant and earnest effort to start you on a business career would terminate in this way. I confess I am puzzled to know what to do with you. I cannot take you home, for I do not wish Roland corrupted by your example. Here Oliver\u0027s lip curled again with scorn. Nor can I recommend you to another place. Knowing you to be dishonest, I should feel that I was doing wrong to give you a good character. I will not tell your old acquaintances here of your sad wickedness. I have too much consideration for you. I have only told Roland, hoping that it may be a warning to him, though I am thankful that he at least is incapable of theft. After anxious consideration, I have decided that you have forfeited all claim to any further help from me. I cast you off, and shall leave you henceforth to shift for yourself. You cannot justly complain, for you must be sensible that you have brought this upon yourself. I intended, sooner or later, to buy an interest for you in my nephew\u0027s business,—that is, if you behaved properly,—but all this is at an end now. I enclose twenty dollars to help you along until you can get something to do. I advise you to enlist on some ship as cabin-boy. There you will be out of reach of temptation, and may, in time, lead a useful, though humble career. I need not say with how much grief I write these words. It pains me to cast you off, but I cannot own any connection with a thief. Roland is also grieved by the news. Hoping that you may live to see the error of your ways, I subscribe myself, Benjamin Kenyon. Oliver read this letter with indignation and amazement. Was it possible that Mr. Kenyon, while in the possession of a large property left him by his mother, could thus coolly cast him off, and leave him to support himself? He wrote the following reply: Mr. Kenyon: I have received your harsh and unjust letter. I am innocent, and you know it. Of the large property which my mother left, you send me twenty dollars, and keep the remainder. I shall keep and use the money, for it is justly mine. Sometime you will repent defrauding an orphan. I don\u0027t think I shall starve, but I shall not soon forget your treachery. Some day—I don\u0027t know when—I will punish you for it. Oliver Conrad.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2088/59225.html","bookId":527,"book":{"id":527,"title":"Adrift in The City or Oliver Conrad\u0027s Plucky Fight","description":"简介： The speaker, a boy of sixteen, stood on the lawn before a handsome country mansion.
