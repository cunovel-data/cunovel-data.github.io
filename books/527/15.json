Our hero took up his quarters at a cheap hotel until, with the help of John Meadows, he obtained a room in St. Mark\u0027s Place. The room was a large square one, tolerably well furnished. The price asked was four dollars a week. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is rather more than I ought to pay just for a room,\" said Oliver. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you how you can get it cheaper,\" said John Meadows. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Take me for your room-mate. I\u0027ll pay a dollar and a half toward the rent.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Oliver hesitated, but finally decided to accept John\u0027s offer. Though his fellow-clerk was not altogether to his taste, it would prevent his feeling lonely, and he had no other acquaintances to select from. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it a bargain?\" said John, delighted. \"I\u0027ll give my Bleecker Street landlady notice right off. Why, I shall feel like a prince here!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then this is better than your room?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You bet! That\u0027s only big enough for a middling sized cat, while this――\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is big enough for two large ones,\" said Oliver, smiling. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, and a whole litter of kittens into the bargain. We\u0027ll have a jolly time together.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course,\" said John seriously, \"when I get married that\u0027ll terminate the contract.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you think of getting married soon?\" asked Oliver, surprised and amused. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you about it,\" said John, with the utmost gravity. \"Last month I had my fortune told.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was told by Mme. Catalina, the seventh daughter of a seventh daughter; so, of course, she wasn\u0027t a humbug.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does that make any difference—being the seventh daughter?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course it does. Well, she told me that I should marry a rich widow, and ever after live in luxury,\" said John, evidently elated by his prospects. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you believe her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course I did. She told things that I knew to be true about the past, and that convinced me she could foretell the future.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Such as what?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She told me I had lately had a letter from a person who was interested in me. So I had. I got a letter from Charlie Cameron only a week before. Me and Charlie went to school together, so, of course, he feels interested in me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What else?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She said a girl with black eyes was in love with me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is that true?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n John nodded complacently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who is it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know her name, but I\u0027ve met her two or three times on the street, and she always looked at me and smiled.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Struck with your looks, I suppose,\" suggested Oliver. \\n\\n \\n\\n John stroked an incipient mustache and stole a look into the glass. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Looks like it,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If she were only a rich widow you wouldn\u0027t mind cultivating her acquaintance?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wish she were,\" said John thoughtfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You haven\u0027t any widow in view, have you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I have,\" said John, rather to Oliver\u0027s surprise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who is it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Her husband used to keep a lager-beer saloon on Bleecker Street, and now the widow carries it on. I\u0027ve enquired about, and I hear she\u0027s worth ten thousand dollars. Would you like to see her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very much,\" answered Oliver, whose curiosity was excited. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come along, then. We\u0027ll drop in and get a couple of glasses of something.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Following his guide, or rather side by side, Oliver walked round to the saloon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does she know you admire her?\" enquired Oliver. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t,\" said John. \"I admire her money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Would you be willing to sell yourself?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"For ten thousand dollars? I guess I would. That\u0027s the easiest way of getting rich. It would take me two hundred years, at eight dollars a week, to make such a fortune.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They entered the saloon. Behind the counter stood a woman of thirty-five, weighing upward of two hundred pounds. She looked good-natured, but the idea of a marriage between her and John Meadows, a youth of nineteen, seemed too ridiculous. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What will you have?\" she asked, in a Teutonic accent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sarsaparilla and lager!\" answered John. \\n\\n \\n\\n Frau Winterhammer filled two mugs in the most business-like manner. She evidently had no idea that John was an admirer. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the same business-like manner she received the money he laid on the counter. \\n\\n \\n\\n John smacked his lips in affected delight. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is very good,\" he said. \"Your lager is always good, Mrs. Winterhammer.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So!\" replied the good woman. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s so!\" repeated John. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then perhaps you comes again,\" said the frau, with an eye to business. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes; I\u0027ll be sure to come again,\" said John, with a tender significance which was quite lost upon the matter-of-fact lady. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you bring your friends, too,\" she suggested. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; I will bring my friends.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dat is good,\" said Mrs. Winterhammer, in a satisfied tone. \\n\\n \\n\\n Having no excuse for stopping longer the two friends went out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you think of her, Oliver?\" asked John. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s a good deal of her,\" answered Oliver, using a non-committal phrase. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, she\u0027s rather plump,\" said John. \"I don\u0027t like a skeleton, for my part.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She doesn\u0027t look much like one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She\u0027s good-looking; don\u0027t you think so?\" enquired John, looking anxiously in his companion\u0027s face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She looks pleasant; but, John, she\u0027s a good deal older than you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She\u0027s about thirty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nearer forty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, no, she isn\u0027t. And she\u0027s worth ten thousand dollars! Think, Oliver, how nice it would be to be worth ten thousand dollars! I wouldn\u0027t clerk it for old Bond any more, I can tell you that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Would you keep the saloon?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I\u0027d let her keep that and I\u0027d set up in something else. We\u0027d double the money in a short time and then I\u0027d retire and go to Europe.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s all very well, John; but suppose she won\u0027t have you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n John smiled—a self-satisfied smile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She wouldn\u0027t reject a stylish young fellow like me—do you think she would? She\u0027d feel flattered to get such a young husband.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps she would,\" said Oliver, who thought John under a strange hallucination. \"You must invite me to the wedding whenever it comes off, John.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You shall be my groomsman,\" answered John confidently. \\n\\n \\n\\n A week later John said to Oliver after supper: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oliver, I\u0027m goin\u0027 to do it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To do what?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to propose to the widder to-night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So soon!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; I\u0027m tired of workin\u0027 for old Bond; I want to go in for myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, John, I wish you good luck, but I shall be sorry to lose you for a room-mate.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lend me a necktie, won\u0027t you, Oliver? I want to take her eye, you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So Oliver lent his most showy necktie to his room-mate, and John departed on his important mission. \\n\\n \\n\\n About half an hour later John rushed into the room in a violent state of excitement, his collar and bosom looking as if they had been soaked in dirty water, and sank into a chair. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked Oliver. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve cast her off!\" answered John in a hollow voice. \"She is a faithless deceiver.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell me all about it, Jack.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n John told his story. He went to the saloon, ordered a glass of lager, and after drinking it asked the momentous question. Frau Winterhammer seemed surprised, said \"So!\" and then called \"Fritz!\" A stout fellow in shirt-sleeves came out of a rear room, and the widow said something to him in German. Then he seized John\u0027s arms, and the widow deliberately threw the contents of a pitcher of lager in his face and bosom. Then both laughed rudely, and John was released. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What shall you do about it, John?\" asked Oliver, with difficulty refraining from laughing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have cast her off!\" he said gloomily, \"I will never enter the saloon again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t,\" said Oliver. \\n\\n \\n\\n Oliver would have felt less like laughing had he known that at that very moment Ezekiel Bond, prompted by Mr. Kenyon, was conspiring to get him into trouble. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2088/59222.html","bookId":527,"book":{"id":527,"title":"Adrift in The City or Oliver Conrad\u0027s Plucky Fight","description":"简介： The speaker, a boy of sixteen, stood on the lawn before a handsome country mansion.
