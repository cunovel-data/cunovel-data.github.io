{"id":23137,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX. DR. FOX IN PURSUIT.","content":"O PENING the outer door, old Nancy counterfeited great surprise at seeing Dr. Fox mounted on horseback, waiting impatiently to have his summons answered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lor\u0027 bress us!\" she exclaimed, holding up both hands, \"what bring you on here so airly, Massa Fox?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nancy, have you seen anything of Mrs. Kenyon and Cleopatra?\" asked the doctor abruptly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How should I see them?\" asked Nancy. \"I haven\u0027t been to the \u0027sylum sence las\u0027 week.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They have run away,\" explained Dr. Fox. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Run away! Good Lor\u0027! What they gone and run away for?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Out of pure cussedness, I expect,\" returned the doctor in a tone of disgust. \"Then you haven\u0027t seen them?—they haven\u0027t passed this way?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not as I knows on. They wouldn\u0027t come to old Nancy. She couldn\u0027t help \u0027em.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was hoping you might have seen them,\" said Dr. Fox, disappointed. \"I don\u0027t know where to look for them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did they get away?\" asked Nancy, fixing her round, bead-like eyes on the doctor, with an appearance of curiosity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t stop to talk,\" said Dr. Fox impatiently. \"I must search for them, though I don\u0027t know where.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope you\u0027ll find \u0027em, Massa Fox,\" said Nancy, rolling her eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n A sudden idea struck Dr. Fox. For a small sum he could enlist Nancy on his side, he thought. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look here, Nancy,\" he said, \"these foolish woman may yet come this way. If they do, let me know in some way, so that I can catch them, and I\u0027ll give you—let me see—I\u0027ll give you five silver dollars.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will you really, Massa Fox?\" exclaimed Nancy, in affected delight. \"Oh, golly, how rich I\u0027ll be!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course you don\u0027t get it unless you earn it, Nancy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027ll work for it; I will, sure, Massa Fox.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If they come here, manage to lock them up in your cabin, and then come to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You may \u0027pend on me, Massa Doctor. Oh, yes, you may \u0027pend on me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That secures her co-operation,\" thought the deluded doctor. \"Five dollars is a fortune to her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He would not have felt quite so confident if he had heard Nancy\u0027s soliloquy after his departure. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mean old hunks!\" she exclaimed. \"So he thinks he\u0027s gwine to buy old Nancy for five dollars! He\u0027s mighty mistaken, I reckon, I won\u0027t give up the poor darlings for no such money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n No doubt the ten dollars she had received from Mrs. Kenyon had its effect; but, to do old Nancy justice, she had a good heart, and, fond as she was of money, would not have sold the secret of those who put confidence in her, even if there had been no money paid her for keeping it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Kenyon, hidden in the loft, heard the conversation with anxiety, lest Nancy should yield to the temptation and betray her place of concealment. When the colloquy was over, and Dr. Fox had ridden away, she felt relieved. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, Nancy,\" she said gratefully, peering over the edge. \"You are indeed a good friend to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I sent Massa Fox off with a flea in his ear,\" said Nancy, her portly form shaken by a broad laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall not forget your kindness, Nancy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is Clopatry awake?\" asked Nancy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said a smothered voice from the straw. \"Is Antony come?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aint seen no gemman of that name, Miss Clopatry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope he hasn\u0027t forgotten his appointment,\" said the queen anxiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What does he look like, in case I see him, Miss Clopatry?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He looks like a prince,\" said Cleopatra. \"He has an air of command. He\u0027s a general, you know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You couldn\u0027t tell me what color hair he\u0027s got!\" said the practical Nancy. \"I don\u0027t know much about princes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Cleopatra looked perplexed. She had never thought particularly about the personal appearance of her hero. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I expect it\u0027s black,\" she said; \"but he\u0027ll ask for me. You\u0027ll know him by that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right, Miss Clopatry. If I see him, I\u0027ll send him right along. Now, what\u0027ll you have for breakfast?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Anything you have, Nancy. We don\u0027t want to put you to too much trouble.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Lor\u0027, Mis\u0027 Kenyon, you needn\u0027t be afeared. What do you say, now, to some eggs and hoe-cake?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I would like some,\" said Cleopatra, brightening up. \"Can I come down, Nancy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just as you please, Miss Clopatry.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think we may venture,\" said Mrs. Kenyon. \"Dr. Fox will not be likely to come back at present.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The two ladies went down the ladder rather awkwardly, not being used to such a staircase. In fact, Cleopatra lost her footing, and fell in a very unqueenly attitude on the earthen floor. She was picked up, however, without having sustained any serious injury. \\n\\n \\n\\n After breakfast Mrs. Kenyon held a consultation with Nancy as to the course she had better pursue. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Better stay here till night, Mis\u0027 Kenyon,\" advised the old woman, \"and then I\u0027ll take you through the woods to Scranton, where the railroad is. Ef you go now, the doctor\u0027ll come cross you and take you back.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where do the cars go, Nancy? To Charleston?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, Miss Kenyon. They go down souf to Georgia.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Until then Mrs. Kenyon had had no fixed plan, except it had occurred to her that it would be best to go to Charleston. But a moment\u0027s reflection satisfied her that she would be more likely to be sought after there than farther south. Dr. Fox would hardly think of following her to Georgia. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That plan will suit me, Nancy,\" she said, after a short pause. \"I don\u0027t much care where I go, as long as I increase the distance between me and that horrible mad-house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will Clopatry go with you?\" asked Nancy, indicating the queen with a jerk of her finger. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will ask her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The plan was broached to Cleopatra, but it met with unexpected opposition. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t go away from Antony,\" she said. \"He is to meet me here. You said he was.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This was true, and it was found impossible to remove the impression from her mind. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Kenyon looked at Nancy in perplexity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What shall we do?\" she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let her stay,\" said Nancy. \"You can go with me. You aint goin\u0027 to be caught so easy if you are alone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Kenyon realized the force of this consideration. Cleopatra was really insane, and her insanity could hardly be concealed from those whom they might encounter in their flight. Dr. Fox would, of course, post notices of their escape, and Cleopatra\u0027s appearance and remarks would, in all probability, make the success of their plans very dubious. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are right, Nancy,\" said Mrs. Kenyon; \"but it seems selfish to go away and leave Cleopatra here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The doctor didn\u0027t treat her bad, did he?\" asked Nancy in a whisper. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then it won\u0027t do her any harm if she does get took back. It\u0027s different with you. Jest let her stay here as long as she wants to. When she finds her man don\u0027t come, she\u0027ll go back likely herself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This was finally agreed to. \\n\\n \\n\\n During the day there were no more visitors, much to the relief of Mrs. Kenyon. \\n\\n \\n\\n At nightfall old Nancy and Mrs. Kenyon set out on their journey. The latter was disguised in an old gown belonging to her hostess, her gown stuffed out to like ample proportions, while a huge bonnet, also belonging to Nancy, effectually concealed her face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You look like my sister, Mis\u0027 Kenyon,\" she said. \"Lor\u0027, I\u0027d never know you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll pass for your sister, Nancy, if any enquiry is made.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Nancy nodded acquiescence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027ll do,\" she said, in a satisfied tone. \"Now, bid good-by to Miss Clopatry, and we\u0027ll go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Cleopatra was quite willing to be left. She was quite persuaded that Antony would come for her during the evening, and urged Mrs. Kenyon to hurry him in case they met him. \\n\\n \\n\\n For two miles Nancy and her companion travelled through the woods, until they came to the bank of a river. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We must go \u0027cross here, Mis\u0027 Kenyon,\" she said. \"There is a boat just here. Get in and I\u0027ll row you across.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Kenyon got into the boat, and Nancy was about to put off, when a horseman rode up rapidly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Halt, there!\" he shouted. \"Who have you got with you, Nancy?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Kenyon\u0027s heart stood still with sickening fear, for the voice was that of Dr. Fox. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2088/59236.html","bookId":527,"book":{"id":527,"title":"Adrift in The City or Oliver Conrad\u0027s Plucky Fight","description":"简介： The speaker, a boy of sixteen, stood on the lawn before a handsome country mansion.
