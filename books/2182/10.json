{"id":99854,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"We manage to squeeze into the Farrier Harrier, even though it isn\u0027t meant to hold more than twelve. We fly all day, Shark and James taking turns to pilot. We set down a couple of times to refuel, eat and stretch our legs. Stop at dusk for dinner at an army base, then continue through the night. I catch a few hours of sleep, using a sleeping spell to drop off.\\n\\n We make our final stop shortly after nine in the morning. Breakfast, a walk, exercise. Then Shark talks us through our plans. We scour maps of the compound, Shark highlighting our route and alternatives in case we run into problems. It\u0027s pretty simple-break in, grab Prae Athim, secure the area around her office and interrogate her there, or else abduct her and make a quick getaway.\\n\\n Meera doesn\u0027t suggest a polite approach this time. Prae Athim is way out of control. Subtlety won\u0027t work on Wolf Island.\\n\\n Shark finishes by asking for any last-minute comments or enquiries. Antoine sheepishly raises a hand. \"Will you try not to cause unnecessary damage? Some of the equipment is very expensive. If we can recycle it later, we can recoup some of the costs of this debacle.\"\\n\\n Shark glares at Antoine. \"If we come through this and I receive an invoice for wreckages, I\u0027ll find you, string you upside down and make you eat your own brains before I kill you. Understand?\"\\n\\n Antoine flushes. \"I was only-\"\\n\\n \"Be quiet,\" Meera snaps.\\n\\n Antoine pouts, but shuts up. Shark casts an eye around. \"Last chance to back out. Anyone?\" Seven of the nine soldiers promptly raise their hands. \"You should be in a sitcom,\" Shark jeers, then claps his hands together loudly and stands. \"Let\u0027s go!\"\\n\\n Back on the helicopter. Within minutes we\u0027re over open water. No retreating now. We\u0027re in this to the bitter, bloody end.\\n\\n The island is one of many in the area, all deserted, most uninhabitable. This is one of the largest. A lot of grass, wild flowers, trees. We spot the werewolves as we skim the treetops. Spread across the island in small groups, most relaxing, some eating (I don\u0027t think much of the natural wildlife exists there anymore), a few fighting. Mutated, vicious, hairy monstrosities, all fangs, claws and muscles. Some howl at us as we pass overhead, though we can\u0027t hear them over the roar of the blades.\\n\\n The wolf within me tries to force its way to the surface, howling silently in reply to its warped brethren. I\u0027m one of the cursed Gradys. I should have turned into a werewolf. I only survived because I\u0027m a magician. My magic self wrestled with my wolfen side and triumphed. But I\u0027ve never rid myself of the wolf, only driven it down deep inside.\\n\\n I don\u0027t have any difficulty keeping my wolfish instincts in check, but I\u0027m surprised to find that a part of me doesn\u0027t want to remain in control. I\u0027m excited by the creatures running free beneath us. Life would be much simpler if I abandoned my humanity and ran wild with them, gave myself over to animalistic pleasures, free of the burdens of duty and responsibility.\\n\\n I\u0027m envious of my twisted relatives, but sad for them too. Because I know their freedom is temporary. If it all goes wrong and Prae Athim turns the tables on us, she\u0027ll use these specimens for her own sick ends. But life won\u0027t be much better for them if we succeed. Antoine Horwitzer will take over, pick the werewolves off one by one, slice them open and carry out all manner of unpleasant experiments.\\n\\n I\u0027m so glad Gret and Bill-E aren\u0027t down there. In a weird way I\u0027m glad they\u0027re dead, rather than captive on this island. Better to be out of life entirely than struggle through it as a tormented, hopeless, inhuman victim.\\n\\n The others are studying the werewolves with a mixture of curiosity and loathing. They have no ties to these unfortunate mutants. They view them simply as enemies. If our plan works, we should have no dealings with the werewolves. But if complications set in, the soldiers might find themselves up against the killer beasts, and in that case they\u0027ll have to be ruthless.\\n\\n Antoine is the only one not awed by the spectacle. He stole a quick glance at the werewolves when we hit the island\u0027s edge, then closed his eyes, dug rosary beads out of a pocket and began to pray. I hadn\u0027t pegged him as a religious type, but when I think about it, it makes sense. After all, the Lambs named themselves after a biblical quote.\\n\\n My stomach clenches and I almost throw up. It\u0027s the werewolf, fighting to free itself. I stop staring at Antoine and focus on driving the wolf back inside. It retreats reluctantly and I feel sorry for it. If I could let it loose for a while, somewhere it couldn\u0027t cause damage, I would, just to give it a taste of freedom.\\n\\n The compound walls come into sight. I was expecting a fence, but there isn\u0027t one, only a long wall of high, thick, metal panels. Lots of werewolves are gathered by the wall, hurling themselves at it, clawing its smooth grey surface, howling at those inside, the stench of human flesh thick in their nostrils. (The stench is also thick in mine. My lips tremble and I am careful not to drool.)\\n\\n As we approach the wall I catch my first glimpse of the compound. It\u0027s built on the extended tip of the island, surrounded on three sides by cliffs and water. The werewolves have only one route of attack. Even if they could swim (Antoine told us they can\u0027t), they\u0027d struggle to climb the sheer cliffs, despite their claws.\\n\\n The compound\u0027s nothing special. A series of grey, drab buildings with flat, aluminium roofs. There are lots of grooves in the ground, which Timas points out, speaking through the microphone on his headset.\\n\\n \"They use the grooves to slot the walls into place,\" he explains. \"An ingenious system. Just lay the grooves, then slide the panels around and click them together. Makes it easy to shuffle the rooms and alter the layout.\"\\n\\n \"Those walls can\u0027t be sturdy,\" Shark grunts.\\n\\n \"They are,\" Timas insists. \"Designed to withstand anything nature can throw at them. The architects couldn\u0027t take chances, not with hundreds of werewolves lying in wait on the other side.\"\\n\\n There\u0027s a landing pad inside the main wall, to the left. A single helicopter stands idle. There are several motorboats stored under tarpaulins at either side of the crag, rope ladders stacked beside them. In the event of an evacuation, that\u0027s how the staff would leave, lowering the boats and climbing down into them.\\n\\n Guards spill out of the nearest building as we touch down, cocking rifles and pistols. One roars through a megaphone, commanding us to come out unarmed.\\n\\n \"This is it!\" Shark yells, brandishing his handguns. \"Don\u0027t kill if you can help it, but don\u0027t show too much mercy either. These guys knew what they were signing up for. They\u0027ve already murdered seventeen people. They\u0027ll rip us to shreds if we give them the chance.\"\\n\\n He rolls out and across the ground, leaps to his feet and opens fire, supported instantly by his team, even Timas, wielding a high-tech weapon that provides him with all sorts of fascinating feedback.\\n\\n Meera and I share a worried glance, then slide out after the others on to the bullet-riddled tarmac, leaving James and Marian to guard the helicopter. Antoine stumbles out after us, still praying, crouched low, sweat staining the collar of his otherwise spotless shirt.\\n\\n The air is ablaze with gunfire. A number of guards are already lying wounded or dead. Others are firing wildly. It\u0027s a simple matter for the well-trained members of Shark\u0027s squad to pick them off.\\n\\n The last few, realising the futility of their position, discard their weapons and thrust their hands into the air. The gunfire ceases. Leo darts forward and makes them lie down, then handcuffs their wrists and ankles. While he\u0027s doing that, the other soldiers advance to the open door and surround it. When Leo joins them, Shark holds up three fingers and counts down. Liam and Terry burst through, laying down a spray of advance fire. In pairs, the rest of the team follow them in. Meera and I bring up the rear, Antoine and Pip ahead of us. The bloodshed sickens me. I don\u0027t mind slaughtering demons, but these are people. It\u0027s not right. I know we have no choice, that these guys are murderers, but still...\\n\\n Cool inside. Air-conditioned. Brightly lit. Liam and Terry are already at the end of the room and halfway through the door to the next room or corridor. No sign of anybody else. These are living quarters. Bunks, cabinets, racks for clothes, photos of models and relatives pinned to the walls. Those we hit outside must have been relaxing. They wouldn\u0027t have been expecting an attack. I wish they hadn\u0027t reacted so swiftly. If we\u0027d caught them in here, we wouldn\u0027t have had to kill so many.\\n\\n \"You OK?\" Meera asks as we wait for the call to advance.\\n\\n \"Not really,\" I groan.\\n\\n \"I know it\u0027s hard,\" she says quietly. \"Try not to think of them as humans but as demonic assistants.\"\\n\\n \"But they probably know nothing about the Demonata,\" I protest.\\n\\n \"They knew about the seventeen Lambs they killed,\" Meera snaps. \"These aren\u0027t innocents.\"\\n\\n \"But they\u0027re still people. I don\u0027t feel comfortable killing like this.\"\\n\\n Meera smiles wanly. \"That\u0027s a good thing. Try and hold on to that attitude. The world\u0027s packed with too many trigger-happy goons.\"\\n\\n \"Like Shark?\" I grin shakily.\\n\\n Meera\u0027s face puckers into something between a scowl and a smirk. Before she can answer, one of the soldiers-I think it\u0027s Spenser-shouts affirmatively and we\u0027re moving forward again, further into the heart of the compound.\\n\\n We don\u0027t encounter much resistance. The occasional guard or two. We\u0027re able to overpower most of them and leave them handcuffed, alive. We only face one real obstacle, when several guards block a long corridor and fill it with furniture. They have a great vantage point. If we try to rush them, we\u0027ll be cut down before we get halfway. But Shark isn\u0027t fazed. He calls Pip forward. She studies the piled-up furniture, makes a few calculations, then takes off her rucksack and roots through it. Produces a small round object. It looks like a thick CD.\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s good with Frisbees?\" Pip asks.\\n\\n \"Here,\" Liam says. He takes the disc, aims, then glances at Pip. \"Do I need to press anything?\"\\n\\n \"No. But if you don\u0027t throw it quickly, you\u0027ll lose an arm.\\n\\n Liam yelps, then sends the disc skimming down the corridor. It hits the mound of furniture near the base and explodes on contact. The desks, chairs and cabinets fly backwards, obliterating the guards behind them. We\u0027re on the scene seconds later, Shark\u0027s troops handcuffing any survivors. Stephen bends over a seriously wounded man. Starts to cuff him, then pauses, studies his injuries, sets him down and presses the barrel of his gun to the man\u0027s head. I look away but I can\u0027t drown out the retort of the muffled shot.\\n\\n We push on, the air thick with the stench of scorched wood, blood and whatever was in Pip\u0027s bomb. Antoine\u0027s still praying. I almost feel like joining in.\\n\\n The corridors and rooms all look the same to me, but the soldiers know exactly where they\u0027re going. A couple of minutes later, we\u0027re at the door of Prae Athim\u0027s office. There are no markings to confirm that, but Timas is certain. He steps ahead of us and raps softly. \"Knock, knock,\" he calls. \"Anybody home?\"\\n\\n He pushes the door open and we spill in.\\n\\n A large room. Grey walls. Harsh fluorescent lights. A single bed. A black, high-backed leather chair in the centre of the floor. Someone\u0027s sitting in it, facing away from us. I can only see the person\u0027s lower legs, but I\u0027m sure it\u0027s Prae Athim.\\n\\n \"Hey!\" Shark barks. No answer. He looks at us. Nods at Pip to advance and check for explosives. She creeps forward, skirting the chair, pistol trained on the person in it. As she angles to the front, she pauses, face crinkling. Shaking her head, she stoops, checks the chair for wires and devices, then puts her hand on one of the arms and swivels it around.\\n\\n I was right. It\u0027s Prae Athim. But, to my bewilderment, she\u0027s strapped down, a strip of tape across her mouth, incapable of movement or sound.\\n\\n We gawp at the sight. Prae Athim glares at us. Shark gulps, then strides forward and grabs hold of one end of the tape over her mouth. Before he can tear it free, somebody shouts a weird word. Whipping round, I spot Antoine Horwitzer, arms wide, grinning crazily. He yells a couple more words and the air shimmers behind him. Too late, I realise the nature of the trap we\u0027ve walked into. I start to roar a warning, but the window opens before I can.\\n\\n It\u0027s an enormous dark window. As I stare at it, horrified, a deformed, miserable-looking creature slithers through. It has the general shape of a woman, but her flesh is bubbling with sores and boils. Pus and blood seep from wounds all over her body. There\u0027s a rancid stink. The eyes are swimming bowls of madness in a ruined face. The mouth is a jagged gash. I know who this abomination is from Dervish\u0027s description, but I would have recognised her anyway.\\n\\n \"Hello, Grubbs,\" the thing that was once Juni Swan gurgles. \"Have you missed me?\"\\n\\n There\u0027s no time to answer. Right behind Juni, dozens of guards file in three abreast, weapons cradled to their chests. Spreading out, they take aim. Before a stunned Shark and his team can react, an officer bellows a command and the air around us is ripped apart by a lethal hail of bullets. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wolf-island-the-demonata-8/page-10.html","bookId":2182,"book":{"id":2182,"title":"Wolf Island (The Demonata #8)","description":"Storyline: Wolf Island (The Demonata #8) \\n As the mysterious Shadow builds an army of demons, Grubbs Grady and his team search desperately for answers.
