{"id":99861,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Dozens are slaughtered within seconds, torn to ragged, fleshy shreds by the frenzied fire of Juni Swan\u0027s soldiers. But the stench of blood only drives the rest of us wilder. We push on without pause, leaping over the jerking bodies of the dead and dying, ignoring the peril, the bullets, the fallen. Not a single beast turns and runs.\\n\\n I\u0027m among the pack, unable to restrain myself, risking all just to be one of the first to claim a human heart. It\u0027s crazy. I should hold back and let them do my dirty work. But for a few mad moments I lose control. I press forward with the others, howling and bellowing, as much of a target as any other werewolf.\\n\\n Then we\u0027re on the terrified soldiers, hacking at them, tearing guns from their hands, chowing down on their sweet, soft flesh and oh-so-chewable bones. Human screams are added to the cacophony of gunfire and howls. The line disintegrates beneath us. I\u0027m past it before I know what\u0027s happening, staring at an empty corridor. I have to stop, swivel and dive back into the fray to claim my victims and be part of the barbaric, bloody feast.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know how much time passes. It could be seconds or minutes. All I\u0027m aware of is the killing and feasting. My world becomes an endless pool of thick, salty blood, springy flesh, brittle bones, juicy inner organs. I butcher heartlessly, wolfishly. I don\u0027t know how many. Bodies are tossed around and pulled apart like chicken wings at a party.\\n\\n When the bloodlust finally passes-when I\u0027ve had my fill-my senses return. I spit out a mouthful of soggy flesh. I\u0027m drenched in blood, my ears and head ringing with noise. I stare at my red, twisted hands and wait to feel disgust and shame. But nothing hits me. I\u0027m neither appalled nor shocked. In this new form I have no delusions. I\u0027m a killer. Whether a killer of demons, werewolves or humans... no matter. I\u0027ve butchered with magic in the Demonata universe. Now I\u0027ve murdered with my hands and teeth here. I feel no more for the people I\u0027ve slaughtered than the demons I fried. To a beast like me, there\u0027s no real difference.\\n\\n I look around for Meera, Timas and Prae. I find them standing in a doorway, transfixed, faces pale, eyes awash with horror. Even the usually unflappable Timas Brauss looks disturbed. I sneer at their expressions, wipe a hand across my lips, then lick them clean.\\n\\n \"Sorry I didn\u0027t offer you anything to eat,\" I chuckle hoarsely.\\n\\n \"Grubbs... you... this...\" Meera can\u0027t find words to express what she feels.\\n\\n \"I did what I had to,\" I grunt. \"It was a fair fight.\"\\n\\n \"But you enjoyed it!\" Meera gasps. \"You laughed as you killed. The way you drank...\"\\n\\n \"I was thirsty,\" I shrug.\\n\\n Before Meera can say anything else, I call my private retinue of advanced werewolves to my side. Not all of the chosen come-some are dead. But most assemble, grinning ghoulishly, blood dripping from their chins.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go and find Juni,\" I tell them, and over the mounds of dead bodies we climb.\\n\\n Not all of the soldiers perished at the perimeter. Some dropped back when they realised their cause was lost. They\u0027re fleeing through the compound, pursued by ravenous werewolves. I don\u0027t know where they think they can hide. It\u0027s over. They\u0027ll be tracked down and slit from groin to skull.\\n\\n Running only adds sport to the slaughter. It\u0027s hard not to give in to temptation and hunt with the pack. Juni\u0027s just one person (or whatever the hell it is that she\u0027s become). There are so many others to chase and murder. I have to focus to keep my feral nature in check. I tell myself Juni will be worth it, that the joy of killing her will be greater than a dozen human deaths.\\n\\n But I\u0027m not convinced. I think I might be happier if I surrendered to my desires and ran wild. I\u0027d like to butcher freely while the butchering\u0027s good.\\n\\n I\u0027m aware of Meera, Timas and Prae arming themselves, picking guns from the corpses. I don\u0027t bother with weapons. I relied on magic and my wits before. Now I have something even better- claws and fangs.\\n\\n Some of the werewolves sniff longingly at the humans, but the members of my personal guard warn them off with soft growls. Give it a few days and they might not be so obedient. But there\u0027s plenty for all to eat now, so they\u0027re willing to let these three snack-boxes on legs pass unmolested.\\n\\n We press further into the building. The stench of Juni\u0027s sickly sweet sweat fills my nostrils. I hope she\u0027s sweating with fear, that she\u0027s trapped, nowhere to run, dreading our confrontation. If she\u0027s not afraid now, I\u0027ll show her fear before I kill her. I don\u0027t want her to die without knowing what it\u0027s like to tremble in the clutches of one more twisted and vicious than yourself.\\n\\n As I\u0027m closing on her location, I feel a sweep of something like air gushing through the compound. It\u0027s warm and tingling. It seeps into my pores, filling me with power.\\n\\n Magic.\\n\\n I should be grateful for the extra strength, but I\u0027m not. The wash of magic through the building can only mean one thing-a window has been opened. I\u0027m not afraid of what might come through-I\u0027d fight any number of demons-but I don\u0027t want Juni skipping ahead of me to safety in the foul universe she\u0027s chosen to call home.\\n\\n \"Quick!\" I roar, darting ahead of the others, shouldering a door aside, rushing down a corridor, homing in on the scent of Juni Swan.\\n\\n \"Grubbs!\" shouts Meera. \"Wait. Don\u0027t go in there alone.\"\\n\\n But nothing can stop me. A couple of seconds later, wild at the thought that I might miss my chance for revenge, I break through another doorway and into the room where we discovered Prae Athim bound and gagged.\\n\\n The window hovers near the back of the room, a jagged red panel of light. I dart towards it, meaning to follow Juni, even though I know it\u0027s suicide. Then a bolt of energy knocks me sideways. Searing pain eats into my flesh, forcing a scream from my lips.\\n\\n I stagger and realise I\u0027ve been tricked. Juni\u0027s still here. She was standing to the left of the door. Easy to spot if I\u0027d been paying attention, but I lost my wits for a few vital seconds. Now she has the upper hand.\\n\\n As I lurch towards her, she mutters a spell and the floor at my feet explodes. Splinters shoot into my stomach, chest and face. I instinctively jerk my head back.\\n\\n Roaring, I raise a hand to protect my eyes. Ignoring the stinging pain of the splinters buried in my flesh, I set my sights on the pustulant, bloodstained, flesh-dripping Juni Swan. She\u0027s smiling insanely. Beyond her, in the doorway, I see Meera and the others, separated from us by an invisible barrier. The werewolves of my retinue are digging at the barrier with their claws, but it will take more than brute force to penetrate Juni\u0027s magic shield.\\n\\n \"Did you think I\u0027d leave without saying goodbye?\" Juni giggles.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll kill you!\" I roar. \"I\u0027ll rip your head from your neck and-\"\\n\\n \"Please don\u0027t finish,\" Juni interrupts. \"I detest vulgarity.\" She waves a hand at me and the splinters expand and burrow deeper into my skin. I gasp and collapse to my knees. Another couple of seconds and they\u0027ll pierce my heart and brain.\\n\\n If you\u0027ll allow me some leeway... the voice of the Kah-Gash murmurs. The splinters shoot out of my body and rain down on Juni. That catches her by surprise. With a shriek, she covers her eyes, protecting them as I did. For a moment she\u0027s defenceless.\\n\\n Using the newly developed muscles in my legs, I spring across the room and bowl Juni over. I slam her to the floor and drive a claw into the putrid, oozing flesh of her stomach. She moans, eyes shooting wide, baring her teeth, trembling with agony. I make a fist, grab some of her inner organs and jerk hard. My hand shlups out, trailing guts. Blood splatters the floor. I gurgle with delight.\\n\\n Juni screams, then covers the hole in her stomach with a hand. Magic flares and the flesh around the hole heals. I don\u0027t care. While she\u0027s repairing herself, I latch on to her head, jam my fangs into the bone behind her right ear, and start chewing my way through to her brain.\\n\\n Juni\u0027s fresh screams fill me with delight. I almost pull away to enjoy her expression. But I know how dangerous she is. I can\u0027t give her any freedom. Best to chew quickly and disable her.\\n\\n Heat flares in my fangs. I try desperately to bite down. I\u0027m almost through the hard covering of the skull. So close to her brain. But the heat\u0027s too much to bear. With a cry of pain and rage, I break free.\\n\\n Juni\u0027s at my throat with incredible speed. Newly grown fingernails dig into the flesh beneath my chin, while the fingers of her other hand tighten around my neck. I sense the fingers stretching, looping, meeting at the back and melting into each other, tightening into a noose. I try to roar but my vocal cords are squeezed shut.\\n\\n I slam an elbow into Juni\u0027s ribs. Several crack. She grunts, but doesn\u0027t release me. She\u0027s cackling. Pokes her face up close to mine. Her left eye was punctured, but it grows back as she taunts me.\\n\\n \"Thought you could kill sweet Juni?\" she screeches. \"Thought a pup like you could overcome a full-grown mistress of dark magic?\" Her fingers tighten another notch. \"What do you think now, Grubitsch?\"\\n\\n I wheeze at her, then manage to get hold of the hand around my throat. Filling my fingers with magic, I sever through the flesh and bones of the noose, then yank myself clear. Panting, I make a fist and smash it into her face. Her nose shatters, splattering me with blood, pus and slimy snot.\\n\\n \"You look like hell,\" I snarl.\\n\\n \"You can talk,\" she sneers, running a scornful eye over my deformed features.\\n\\n For a moment we grin at each other and get our breath back.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not too late,\" Juni purrs. \"Join us. I sensed you killing those pitiful humans. You\u0027ve found your true self. Come with me. Put the last vestiges of your useless human morals behind you. With us, you can kill forever. There\u0027s a whole world of humans to torment and butcher. You can be a glorious, wolfen god.\"\\n\\n \"I bet I could have you too,\" I chuckle darkly.\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" she smiles. \"Lord Loss is my master, but you could be my mate. I can change out of this grotesque form, be any woman you wish. In the new world, anything will be possible.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s just one problem,\" I sigh.\\n\\n \"What?\" Juni frowns.\\n\\n \"I hate your guts,\" I hiss and spring on her.\\n\\n I drive my fist towards the hole where Juni\u0027s nose used to be. My plan is to jam a few fingers in the gap, widen it, then claw out her brain, scoop by gloopy scoop. But Juni\u0027s faster. She ducks, then lashes at my stomach with a leg. I wasn\u0027t expecting a bloody kung fu move! I\u0027m sent hurtling backwards and slam hard into the wall. My head cracks and my neck almost snaps.\\n\\n She\u0027s on me before I hit the floor, hands a blur, jabbing incessantly. I try to roar, but all that comes out is a startled croak. I get a glimpse of her throat and lunge for it. Juni shimmies and rams a forearm into my mouth, gagging me. As I choke, she sends what feels like a million volts of magic sizzling through my body. I scream mutedly and go limp. Juni hits me with another burst of energy. Another.\\n\\n Blood\u0027s pumping from my nose, mouth and ears. Even from my eyes. I\u0027m seeing events through a red mist. I reach deep within myself, looking for the power to strike back, but I\u0027m in disarray.\\n\\n Forgetting about magic, I lash out at Juni. She laughs, removes the arm from my mouth and wraps it around me. Squeezes tight, like a boa constrictor.\\n\\n \"Poor Grubbs,\" she coos, wiping blood from my eyes. \"You don\u0027t have the hang of magic, do you? You\u0027re strong, but experience is everything. My master told me to be wary, but I knew I had the beating of you. When the soldiers and werewolves failed, I decided to finish you off myself.\"\\n\\n I spit blood at her. She stops it mid-air, letting the pearly drops float in front of my eyes. Then she leans forward, extends her tongue and delicately slurps the red pearls from the air, as though tasting an exquisite wine.\\n\\n \"Now it\u0027s time to die,\" she says. Her face is blank. The madness and hatred in her eyes have been replaced by a cold business-like look.\\n\\n I struggle feebly. This can\u0027t be happening. I\u0027m the pack leader, a magician, part of the Kah-Gash. I\u0027ve fought and defeated stronger demons than this servant of Lord Loss. I should be dancing on her corpse, not fighting for breath, locked within her suffocating embrace.\\n\\n \"A kiss,\" Juni hums, pressing her face to mine. \"I\u0027ll suck your last breath from your body along with your part of the Kah-Gash. I\u0027ll take everything and own you completely. You might think it\u0027s the end, but your agonies are just beginning. I have the power of death. I\u0027ll pluck at the strings of your soul until the end of time, and every strum will draw a thousand screams.\"\\n\\n She covers my mouth and inhales, drawing the last of my oxygen from my lungs. I go limp, senses crumpling. It\u0027s like she\u0027s sucking me down a tunnel into herself. I can\u0027t fight. I\u0027m helpless. I\u0027m doomed.\\n\\n Then, for no apparent reason, she breaks the contact and blinks, staring at me as if stabbed in the back. My heart leaps hopefully. Someone must have found a way past the barrier, snuck up behind her and struck while she was gloating over me. I glance over her shoulder in search of my saviour but I can\u0027t see anyone.\\n\\n Juni releases me and takes a step back. Her expression clears and she smiles. Then she laughs, and the laughter strikes me harder than any of her blows. She screams with crazy delight, jumping up and down on the spot, bits of her diseased flesh dropping off like bloated ticks.\\n\\n \"Oh, Grubbs!\" she cries. \"You absolute darling. How delicious. How ironic. The saviour of the world... protector of mankind... Hah!\"\\n\\n I slump to the floor, take a painful, rasping breath and stare at Juni. Has she lost herself entirely to madness? Have I been saved by a mental breakdown?\\n\\n \"I just had a vision, darling Grubbs,\" Juni says, backing up to the window. \"I had them all the time when I was Beranabus\u0027s assistant. I catch glimpses of the future. That\u0027s why he valued my services so highly. I served Lord Loss in the same way when I joined him. That\u0027s how we knew the cave in Carcery Vale was going to be reopened, why we acted when we did.\\n\\n \"But this vision was the most vivid ever. You were in it, the star of the show. It was the near future... very near. You were at your most powerful, tapping into the sort of power that would allow you to crush me like a bug.\"\\n\\n Juni sticks a hand through the window. It\u0027s pulsing at the edges. It will close soon, but not before she fires off her parting shot.\\n\\n \"I saw the world destroyed,\" she whispers. \"It was blown to pieces. The seas bubbled away, lava erupted, the land split and crumbled. Everyone died, young and old, good and bad. Then a ball of fire burst from the heart of the planet, incinerated the globe and blasted the ashes off into space, before spreading to consume the universe-worlds, suns, galaxies, all.\\n\\n \"You were there,\" she sobs, crying with happiness. \"But you weren\u0027t trying to stop it. You made no attempt to save the world. You couldn\u0027t... you didn\u0027t want to... because you were controlling the mayhem. The Demonata won\u0027t destroy your universe, Grubbs Grady-you will!\"\\n\\n With that she skips through the window, giggling girlishly. Moaning wildly, I drag myself after her, but before I\u0027m even halfway the window disintegrates, and all I can do is lower my face to the cold, hard, blood-drenched floor and weep. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wolf-island-the-demonata-8/page-17.html","bookId":2182,"book":{"id":2182,"title":"Wolf Island (The Demonata #8)","description":"Storyline: Wolf Island (The Demonata #8) \\n As the mysterious Shadow builds an army of demons, Grubbs Grady and his team search desperately for answers.
