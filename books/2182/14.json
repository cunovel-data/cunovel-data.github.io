{"id":99858,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"We wait for them to dig through to us. It\u0027s horrible, sitting here helplessly, the sounds of the tunnelling werewolves growing louder, coming closer. We can hear them snuffling and whining softly, hungrily. The only positive thing is that there don\u0027t seem to be many of them. It looks like I was right about the smarter few opting to keep us for themselves. The downside is that the smarter beasts are also the stronger, faster, deadlier creatures. But we\u0027ll happily take the fiercer few over the weaker masses. Shark did an ammunition tally earlier. They\u0027re all down to one rifle each, none of them full, no spare clips. They have handguns which won\u0027t last long. They won\u0027t be able to keep the werewolves back with sustained fire like before. If we have more than a few dozen beasts to deal with between here and the sea, we\u0027ll run dry in no time and it\u0027ll be hand-to-hand combat after that. While we\u0027re waiting, the glow from Timas\u0027 gun fades, then dies, leaving us in complete darkness. Luckily Timas has already set his explosives, so it doesn\u0027t affect our plans, just our nerves. The werewolf within me is excited by the closeness of its twisted kin. It wants to dig from this side of the hole and link up with its soulmates. I\u0027m tempted, in a sick way, to unleash it and let it loose on Shark, Meera and the others. It\u0027s a bit like the feeling I get when I\u0027m standing on a cliff or high building, looking down at a suicidal drop. I start thinking about what would happen if I stepped off, the rush of the fall, the shattering collision, the quiet emptiness of death. Part of me wants to experience the thrill of complete surrender... But I\u0027ve always ignored that niggling voice and I ignore it now. Hold tight. Stay focused. Wait. We can smell them now and hear their laboured panting. We\u0027ve moved down the cave, as close to the lowest point as we can crawl. I thought it would have made more sense to stay back from the blast, but Timas insists he knows what he\u0027s doing. \"Time is of the essence,\" he says. \"We have to risk getting singed.\" The werewolves sound like they\u0027re no more than a metre away. Maybe the first one is already sticking its head through, sliding into our cave. Impossible to tell in the darkness. I want Timas to detonate the bombs immediately, before it\u0027s too late, but he only hums and whistles, waiting... waiting... Finally, when I think my nerves are going to snap, Timas whispers, \"Shut your eyes, cover your ears and keep your fingers crossed.\" A second or two later the rocks explode outwards. I\u0027m struck by a few chips and stony splinters, but they\u0027re only scratches. Light floods the cave. I open my eyes, but can\u0027t see very far through the dust cloud. \"Go!\" Timas coughs and we crawl on our knees until we can stand and run crouched over. Scraps of flesh, bones, guts and hair line the floor. Blood\u0027s everywhere, making it slippery underfoot. My stomach rumbles. It\u0027s been a long time since breakfast. The wolfen part of me would happily tuck in and make short work of the offal. We stumble out of the tunnel, Stephen and Shark in the lead, Meera and me in the middle, Timas and Prae bringing up the rear. The sunlight is glorious after the darkness of the cave, but there\u0027s no time to lap it up. A couple of werewolves are staggering around, bloodstained, shaking their heads, dazed. No sign of any others. We\u0027ve come through on the far side of the rocky outcrop, out of sight of the multitudes. \"Come on,\" Shark hisses. \"Let\u0027s-\" A growling sound from my left. I whirl and catch sight of a werewolf leaping through the air. It was hiding behind a rock. Three others emerge from behind similarly sized rocks. The cunning beasts have set an ambush! The first werewolf lands on Shark and knocks away his rifle. Shark snarls as the werewolf growls. He grabs its head and jerks it left then right, trying to snap the beast\u0027s neck before it chews his face off. Stephen makes the crucial mistake of aiming at the werewolf attacking Shark instead of the other three behind it. Two of them tackle him as he squeezes off his first shot. He yelps, then he\u0027s gone, covered by the werewolves, their claws and fangs glinting in the sunlight as they tear into him. He doesn\u0027t even have time to scream. The final werewolf bounds towards Meera, Prae and me. Meera raises her rifle and the beast stops and glares at us-it clearly knows what a gun is, the damage it can cause. It looks around. Stephen\u0027s bullet struck the first werewolf just above its heart, wounding but not killing. It\u0027s still struggling with Shark and has driven him back into the tunnel. He\u0027s managed to free his knife and is slicing at the beast\u0027s throat. The werewolf who was coming after us chooses the easier option. It changes direction and dives after Shark, driving him further back. Meera fires at it. Misses. Starts after it, to help Shark. \"Get the hell out of here!\" Shark bellows, smashing the first werewolf\u0027s face with an elbow, ducking to grab the second by its waist. He whirls it round and hurls it away. \"Go!\" he screams at us furiously as the werewolf regains its feet and leaps at him again. \"Come on,\" Timas says, tapping my shoulder. \"But-\" Meera and I start to protest at the same time. \"Stay and die,\" Timas says calmly, \"or run and live. Your choice.\" He sets off, Prae Athim just behind him. Two of the werewolves are still snacking on Stephen. The other two are forcing Shark further back. There are no more in sight, apart from the befuddled few we first spotted. But it\u0027s surely a matter of seconds rather than minutes before others come running to investigate the explosion and howls. I find myself moving before I consciously make the decision, my feet one step ahead of my brain. Shark\u0027s our leader. He gave us an order to run. We\u0027d be fools if we ignored him, and Shark never tolerated fools gladly. My last glimpse of the burly ex-soldier is of him wrestling with one werewolf, while keeping the other at bay with his knife, backing up into the shadows of the tunnel, conceding ground reluctantly, stubbornly. Then the dust from the explosion enfolds and obscures him and the werewolves, swallowing them whole. With a cry of hate and fear, I turn, grab Meera and flee after Timas and Prae. It seems hopeless without Shark. I was sure he\u0027d be the last of us to fall. Without him all is surely lost. But he went down fighting and the rest of us owe it to him to give it our best shot. If we fail, we should at least die valiantly-like Shark. The scent of the sea thickens in my nostrils as we run, drawing me towards it. There are howls behind us. The werewolves have found our trail again. But we\u0027ve worked up a solid lead. We have half a chance. \"This is it,\" Timas pants as we struggle up a steep rise. \"When we get to the top... it\u0027s a sixty metre run... to the edge... give or take a few... metres.\" He sneaks a quick look back. His brow creases and his large eyes narrow. \"We won\u0027t make it. They\u0027ll catch us.\" \"We have to... try,\" I cry, lungs bursting, legs aching. \"Someone has to lay down... covering fire,\" he says. \"I\u0027ll stop at the... top and make my last... stand.\" \"No!\" Meera shouts. \"We\u0027ve lost too many already.\" \"We\u0027ll all die if I don\u0027t,\" Timas says simply. \"I\u0027ll do it,\" Prae gasps. She\u0027s lagging a few paces behind the rest of us. \"I\u0027m the slowest. Besides, they\u0027re my werewolves.\" \"I\u0027m a better shot,\" Timas says. \"This is my job. It makes more sense... for me... to stay.\" \"What the hell,\" Prae wheezes. \"Let\u0027s both do it... and die together.\" \"As you wish.\" We\u0027re almost at the top. Timas slaps my back. \"One last push and... you\u0027re there. Don\u0027t slow or look back. Run, jump, swim. Meera...\" She looks around. \"I\u0027m sorry I won\u0027t... be able to claim... that kiss you promised.\" \"Don\u0027t worry,\" Meera says. \"I lied. I wouldn\u0027t have kissed you anyway.\" The tall man\u0027s face drops and Meera groans. \"I\u0027m joking!\" Timas\u0027 smile lights up his face again. With a cheerful wave he stops, turns, swings his rifle round and opens fire. Glancing over my shoulder, I see Prae halt, drop to her knees, take aim. The werewolves are damn close, dozens of them, the larger, enhanced members to the front, leading the pack. I mount the crest of the rise after Meera. The clifftop lies enticingly ahead of us, the sixty-odd metres away that Timas calculated. My heart leaps in my chest. I catch up with Meera. We\u0027re going to make it! I don\u0027t care if we perish when we dive, if the tide\u0027s out, or if we\u0027re driven under by vicious currents. At least we won\u0027t die here on this cursed, savage island of... Werewolves. Streaming towards the edge of the cliff from our left and right. They\u0027ve split into two groups and flanked us. The smarter beasts must have guessed our plan. Rather than waste themselves on Timas and Prae, they branched around. As we watch in horror, they dart ahead of us and form a barrier across the top of the cliff, two or three bodies deep. Some remain to the sides, to ensure we don\u0027t veer off. We come to a stop. Meera points her gun at the creatures ahead of us, then does a quick headcount and lets it drop. She looks at me and shrugs. We share a bitter smile. I\u0027d like to hug her, but I haven\u0027t the energy. With incredible weariness we half-crouch and cross our arms on our knees. We\u0027re panting like thirsty dogs, surrounded, trapped, waiting for the werewolves to close in and brutally finish us off.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wolf-island-the-demonata-8/page-14.html","bookId":2182,"book":{"id":2182,"title":"Wolf Island (The Demonata #8)","description":"Storyline: Wolf Island (The Demonata #8) As the mysterious Shadow builds an army of demons, Grubbs Grady and his team search desperately for answers.
