{"id":99853,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Six or seven hundred werewolves on the loose, in the hands of a maniac most likely in league with Lord Loss. Nice! Demons rarely have time to kill many people because they can only stay on this world for a few minutes, while the window they crossed through remains open. But hundreds of werewolves, divided into groups of ten or twelve, set free in dozens of cities around the globe... If each only killed five people, I make that three and a half thousand fatalities. But it\u0027s more likely they\u0027d kill ten times that number, maybe more. We\u0027re in Antoine\u0027s office on the eleventh floor. It used to be Prae Athim\u0027s. It\u0027s a large room, but with twelve of us it\u0027s a tight fit. Nobody\u0027s said anything since we came in. We\u0027ve been looking through photos of the specimens which Antoine gave us, studying the data that he has on file. I know from my own brush with lycanthropy that werewolves are strong and fast. I felt like an Olympic athlete when it was my time of turning. But I\u0027m still seriously freaked by what I\u0027m reading. I never knew they were this advanced. I shouldn\u0027t let it matter. The Shadow must remain the priority. If it succeeds in uniting the demon masses and breaking through, the world will fall. The damage a pack of escaped werewolves might cause is nothing in comparison. But how can I ignore the possibility of tens of thousands of deaths? Beranabus could. He\u0027s half-demon and has spent hundreds of years subduing his human impulses. We\u0027re statistics to him. He\u0027d take the line that a few thousand lives don\u0027t make much difference in the grand scheme of things, that we have to focus on the millions and billions-real numbers. I can\u0027t do that. Even if we find out that the attack in Carcery Vale has nothing to do with the demon assault at the hospital, that Prae Athim isn\u0027t working with Lord Loss, I have to try and stop her. I won\u0027t let thousands of people die if I can prevent it. Especially not when the killers are relatives of mine. Perhaps crazily, I still think of the werewolves as kin, even those bred in cages. They\u0027re part of the Grady clan. That makes it personal. \"We have to find them,\" I blurt out, without meaning to. All heads in the office bob up and everybody stares at me. I\u0027m sitting by one of the large windows, the city spread out behind me. Any of the people on the streets, eleven floors down, could fall victim to the werewolves if Prae Athim unleashes them. \"We have to stop this.\" I get to my feet, discarding the photos I\u0027d been mutely studying. \"Maybe there\u0027s nothing to stop,\" Meera says unconvincingly. \"Maybe Prae was telling the truth about a new disease and took them to dispose of safely. Perhaps the few who were sent to attack Dervish were simply being used to settle an old score, and were then executed along with the rest.\" \"Bull!\" Shark snorts. \"If she\u0027d wanted to kill them, she\u0027d have slaughtered them in their cages. It would have been a lot simpler than smuggling them out.\" \"Probably,\" Meera sighs. \"I was just saying maybe...\" \"What will she do with them?\" Marian asks. \"I guess she\u0027ll drop them off in a city somewhere,\" Shark replies. \"Let them run wild. Maybe collect them at the end and take them on somewhere else.\" \"But why?\" Marian frowns. \"Why not build bombs, poison a city\u0027s water supply or develop chemical weapons? Hijacking hundreds of werewolves to use as crazed assassins... it\u0027s like something out of a Batman comic!\" \"Crazy people don\u0027t think the way we do,\" Meera says glumly. \"They have all sorts of warped ideas and plans, and if they gain enough power, they get to inflict their mad schemes on others.\" \"Like Davida Haym in Slawter,\" I note. \"There\u0027s another possibility,\" Terry says. \"She might have done this for humane reasons. Maybe she suffered a moral crisis. Decided they\u0027d been mistreating these creatures. Took them somewhere isolated, to set them free.\" \"Unlikely,\" Antoine says with a cynical smile. \"Her people killed seventeen of our staff during the breakouts. Many more were seriously injured. Hardly the work of a good Samaritan.\" \"I\u0027ve seen fanatics who think animals are nobler than humans,\" Terry says. \"They\u0027d happily kill a human to save a dog or cat from abuse.\" \"Prae Athim isn\u0027t an animal rights activist,\" Antoine says firmly. \"I refuse to entertain the notion that she did this to free the specimens, that she stood waving them off as they returned to the wilds, happy tears in her eyes.\" \"He\u0027s right,\" Shark says. \"We have to assume this was done with the intent of creating maximum havoc.\" \"So let\u0027s track her down and stop her,\" I snarl. \"We can\u0027t just sit here and talk about it. We have to... to...\" I throw my hands up, frustrated. \"We all know how you feel,\" Meera says sympathetically. \"But until she makes a move, there\u0027s nothing we can do. The world\u0027s a big place. You could hide seven hundred werewolves just about anywhere. We can\u0027t-\" \"I could find them,\" Timas interrupts. \"If I had access to your mainframe,\" he adds, smiling at Antoine. \"I told you-the records have been wiped,\" Antoine scowls. \"It\u0027s virtually impossible to wipe a mainframe completely clean,\" Timas says. \"That\u0027s one of the reasons I was surprised you still used one. I can perform at the very least a partial restore.\" \"We\u0027ve had experts working on it for the last six weeks,\" Antoine says sharply. \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve employed some of the best people in the business,\" Timas says earnestly. \"But I\u0027m the very best.\" \"Even assuming you could restore it,\" Shark rumbles, \"how would that help us? She\u0027s unlikely to have outlined her secret plans on a work computer.\" \"You can\u0027t move that many bodies around without leaving a trail,\" Timas says. \"If I find out more about the creatures, I can use that information to fish for clues on the web.\" \"What do you mean?\" Shark asks. \"They didn\u0027t take the cages,\" Timas notes. \"That means they transported them in cages of their own. Once I know what the cages are made from, I can search for companies who specialise in this type of construction and find out if they\u0027ve filled any large orders recently. If they have, I\u0027ll learn where they delivered the cages to. \"If I can determine how the werewolves were tranquilised, I can track the drugs back to where they were manufactured, then trace them through delivery records. \"How did they transport the creatures-aeroplanes, articulated trucks, trains, boats? I\u0027m assuming they moved at least some of them across international borders. There will be a trail of red tape, no matter how surreptitiously they went about it. I\u0027ve followed such trails before and enjoyed a large measure of success. \"Do you want me to continue explaining or shall I get started?\" Timas addresses this question to Antoine Horwitzer. Antoine\u0027s torn. \"Is he really that good?\" he asks Shark. \"Yes.\" \"If he can do what he says... he will have access to confidential information. He\u0027ll have to sign a privacy clause. We need absolute affirmation that he\u0027d never reveal-\" \"You present the forms, he\u0027ll sign them,\" Shark cuts in. Antoine struggles with the idea for a couple of seconds, then sighs. \"Very well. I\u0027ll log you in and provide you with the relevant security codes.\" \"No need,\" Timas says, sliding on to Antoine\u0027s plush leather chair. \"I can crack them. The exercise will serve as a useful warm-up.\" \"How long will it take?\" Shark asks as Timas\u0027 fingers dance across the keyboard. \"A few days, I imagine,\" Timas replies absently. \"Quicker if we get a lucky break. Longer if she\u0027s hidden her trail artfully. I\u0027ll need complete privacy. And my equipment from the helicopter.\" \"I\u0027ll have it sent down,\" Shark says and ushers us out. \"Perhaps I should stay and keep an eye on him,\" Antoine says nervously. \"No chance,\" Shark responds firmly and pushes out the suave chief executive, ignoring his spluttering protests. Some of the rooms on the uppermost floor have beds, or couches which pull out into sleeping cots. Members of the higher echelon move around a lot between buildings owned by the Lambs. Given the secretive nature of their business, they often prefer to stay onsite rather than check into hotels. I\u0027m sharing a room with Spenser and James. They don\u0027t speak to me much. They know I\u0027m part of Beranabus\u0027s world of magic and demons, but they\u0027ve had little first-hand experience of that. They find it hard to think of me as anything other than an especially large but otherwise unremarkable teenager. I\u0027m not too bothered. I find most of their conversation pretty boring-weapons, planes, helicopters, war, battle tactics. I\u0027m happy to be excluded. I spend my spare time experimenting, testing my powers. I don\u0027t know how much I\u0027m capable of doing on this world, in the absence of magical energy. I want to find out what my limits are, so as not to exceed them and leave myself exposed. I\u0027m pretty good at moving objects. Size doesn\u0027t seem to matter-I can slide a heavy oak wardrobe across the floor as easily as a telephone. I spend a couple of hours moving things around. I\u0027m pretty beat by the end, and not back to full fitness until the next morning. It\u0027s reassuring that I can recharge, but worrying that it takes so long once I\u0027ve been drained. Other manoeuvres are more demanding. I can heighten my senses-to eavesdrop on a conversation, or view a scene from a few kilometres away-but that takes a lot of effort and quickly eats into my resources. I can\u0027t change shape, but I can make myself partially invisible for a very short time. I can create fire and freeze objects, but again those demand a lot of me. I can shoot off several bolts of magical energy, but I\u0027m good for nothing for hours afterwards. There are all sorts of compensating spells which I could make use of if I knew them. But I refused to dabble in magic when I lived with Dervish and I didn\u0027t need spells in the Demonata universe-if a spell was required there, Beranabus took care of it. He wasn\u0027t interested in training Kernel or me, just in using us to bully and kill demons. I wish I\u0027d demanded more of Beranabus and Dervish. Mages can do a lot with a few subtle spells. As a magician I could do even more. I get Meera to teach me some simple incantations, but we don\u0027t have time to cover much ground. I worry about my uncle constantly. What\u0027s he doing? Where is he? Time moves differently in the other universe, usually faster or slower than here. Years might have passed for him, or only minutes. Is he alive or dead? I\u0027ve no way of knowing. Beranabus taught me how to open windows, so I could go and find them. But I couldn\u0027t guarantee how long that would take. I have to remain here until our mission\u0027s over. I\u0027m the reason the others are involved, the one who vowed to track down Prae Athim and uncover the truth. I can\u0027t cut out early. That would be the selfish act of a child, which I\u0027m not. I\u0027m a Disciple. We see things through to the end. No matter how scared and alone we feel. Four days pass. Everyone\u0027s impatient for news, but Timas refuses to provide us with partial updates. On the few occasions that Shark barges into Antoine\u0027s office and demands answers, the reply is always the same. \"I\u0027ll summon you promptly when I\u0027ve concluded my investigations.\" Timas finally reaches that conclusion shortly before dawn of the fifth day. Shark hammers on our door, waking us all, then sticks his head in and shouts, \"The office! Now!\" Five minutes later we\u0027re all huddled around Timas and his computers. We\u0027re bleary-eyed, hair all over the place, typical early morning messes. Except Timas. As far as I know, he\u0027s worked almost non-stop since I last saw him, sleeping only two or three hours a night. But he looks as perky as an actor in a TV advert. \"I\u0027ve found them,\" he says without any preliminaries. \"They\u0027re on an island. It has no official name, but the Lambs nicknamed it Wolf Island. Prae Athim purchased it through a fifth-generation contact several years ago.\" \"What\u0027s a fifth-generation contact?\" I ask. \"A contact of a contact of a contact of a contact of a contact,\" Timas intones. \"She conducts most of her business that way, making it almost impossible to trace anything back to her personally. Almost,\" he repeats with a justifiably smug smile. \"Where\u0027s the island?\" Shark grunts. Timas passes him a stapled printout of about twenty pages, then hands copies around to the rest of us. The small sheaf is crammed with all sorts of info about the island, its history, dimensions, wildlife, plant life, natural formations. There are several maps, most of the island, but also of the surrounding waters, noting currents, depth, temperatures, sea life. \"They\u0027ve built a base,\" Timas points out. \"Page nine. They constructed it on the island\u0027s largest crag, so they need only face an assault from one direction if the werewolves get out of control. That extra measure wasn\u0027t a necessity-the fortifications are sound, with more than six separate security systems in place, powered by a variety of independent generators. The werewolves might have the run of the island, but the people inside the compound are quite-\" \"The beasts are running free?\" Shark interrupts. \"Yes. That\u0027s on page four. They were set loose once delivered to the island, though they can be recaptured, singly or in small groups, using a variety of equipment provided for such a purpose.\" \"Maybe Terry was right,\" Meera says dubiously. \"Perhaps Prae took them there to let them live naturally.\" \"I think not,\" Timas purrs, \"and would refer you to page fourteen, appendix Bii, in support of my opinion.\" Antoine and a few of the others flick forward. Shark tosses his copy of the report aside and snaps, \"Don\u0027t play games. Just tell us.\" \"No games,\" Timas says mildly. \"The appendix outlines everything concisely. But if you would prefer an oral report...\" \"I would,\" Shark snarls. \"No!\"Antoine gasps, turning a shade paler beneath his tan. He must be a speed-reader because he\u0027s already flicking from page fourteen to fifteen, eyes scanning the lines super-fast. \"This can\u0027t be right. I would have known.\" \"The figures are accurate,\" Timas says. \"Nothing is speculative.\" He faces Shark. \"A third have been genetically, surgically and electronically modified by Prae Athim and her team. She found a way to corrupt their metabolisms. This allowed her to do two things. First, using steroids, implants and a variety of drugs, she created faster, stronger animals. Second, by operating on their brains and using other implants, she was able to train them.\" \"They can\u0027t survive at those levels,\" Antoine says, glancing up from his report. \"Their bodies can\u0027t hold, not subjected to such degrees of abuse.\" \"Their long-term prospects are grim,\" Timas agrees. \"But they can last a few years, or so the scientists believe.\" \"What have they been trained to do?\" Shark asks. \"Nothing too complex,\" Timas says. \"They can hunt in small groups, in pursuit of predefined targets-like hounds, they can be given a person\u0027s scent. They\u0027re not as reliable as hounds. In a crowded environment they might be distracted and chase others instead. And they\u0027ll turn on their handlers afterwards unless subdued. But that\u0027s a huge step forward.\" \"I\u0027d no idea she\u0027d advanced to such a stage,\" Antoine whispers. \"We\u0027ve been trying to install control mechanisms for decades. We could have done so much good if we\u0027d known about this. We still could.\" \"The Lambs are finished,\" Shark says, \"at least as far as werewolves are concerned. Do you really think people will trust you with their young once word of this gets out? And it will-have no doubt about that.\" \"You\u0027re right,\" Antoine sighs. \"But those on the island are still alive. If we can bring them back under our authority and follow up on these incredible breakthroughs...\" \"You\u0027re assuming we\u0027ll leave any of them alive,\" Shark laughs brutally. Before Antoine can react to that, he says to Timas, \"What\u0027s the best way to hit them? Do we need more troops?\" Timas purses his lips. \"If the original implants had been left intact, we could have electronically disabled them from the air. But they were all secretly removed or rendered inactive prior to the abduction. The safest way would be to blanket-bomb the island.\" \"No!\" I cry. \"You can\u0027t just kill them. They were human once.\" \"They\u0027re not anymore,\" Shark shrugs. \"I won\u0027t let you,\" I growl. \"You can\u0027t stop me,\" he says blankly. \"Actually, I can.\" I raise a hand and let little forks of blue lightning crackle between my fingertips. Shark squints at me, taking my measure. \"He\u0027d whup you,\" Meera says to Shark. \"He\u0027s a magician. You wouldn\u0027t stand a chance.\" \"Probably not.\" Shark grimaces. \"Besides, I don\u0027t trust fly-boys and their damn guided missiles. They could level the compound by accident, and we need Prae alive. Options, Timas?\" \"Go as we are.\" He holds up his copy of the report, flicks to near the end and taps the page. \"There are very few guards. It\u0027s mostly scientists and medics. If we just hit the compound, we can drop in and make a neat job of it.\" \"You\u0027re sure?\" Shark asks. \"Absolutely,\" Timas says. \"I can provide you with a complete breakdown of the odds if you wish.\" \"No need,\" Shark smiles. \"Twelve it is.\" \"Thirteen,\" Antoine corrects him. Shark laughs. \"You\u0027re not serious.\" \"Never more so. I\u0027m coming.\" \"You\u0027re not,\" Shark says, his smile disappearing. \"This is a job for soldiers and Disciples.\" \"I won\u0027t pretend to be an action hero,\" Antoine says with quiet dignity. \"I\u0027m not your equal in matters such as these. But I\u0027m coming regardless. I run this operation now. I\u0027m not sure what you want with Prae, but if you don\u0027t kill her, I plan to bring her to justice. And there\u0027s the matter of the specimens. They have to be returned. Or perhaps we can continue our work on the island. I need to undertake a study before I make a proposal to the board.\" \"You can do that later,\" Meera says. \"Let us go in, shut down Prae\u0027s operation and take control of the situation. You can fly in after we\u0027re finished and-\" \"You don\u0027t understand!\" Antoine shouts, losing his temper for the first time. His jaw trembles as he glares at us. \"This happened on my watch. I was supposed to control her. There have already been calls for my head. I\u0027m hanging on to this job by my fingernails. If the board of governors finds out about this island and that I let you waltz in unrestricted and unmonitored...\" Antoine looks appealingly at Shark. \"I need to come with you. And it won\u0027t be a one-way favour. I can help. I know Prae, her people, the specimens. I can advise and caution if necessary.\" \"It\u0027d be dangerous,\" Shark says. \"If you come, you\u0027re on your own. Nobody will risk their life to save yours.\" \"In this business, you never expect anyone to be helpful,\" Antoine smirks, in command of his temper again. \"Do I have time to pack a few things?\" \"No,\" Shark snorts and marches out of the office. The rest of us follow him up the stairs to where the helicopter is waiting and off we set for Wolf Island.
