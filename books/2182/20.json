{"id":99864,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"I keep humming a tune to myself, one Dervish used to sing when he\u0027d had a bit too much wine. \"Speed, bonny boat, like a bird on the wing.\" But in my head I change it to, \"Speed, bonny wolf.\"\n I don\u0027t like boats. Too slow. We could have taken the helicopter that was on the island when we arrived-we\u0027d have found the missing parts if we\u0027d searched-but we couldn\u0027t have squeezed in all my werewolf buddies. Besides, I don\u0027t think Shark is in any fit state to play pilot. Timas and Meera patched up the worst of his wounds, but he looks dozy and keeps drifting in and out of consciousness, slumping over, then snapping awake when a wave hits the side of the boat.\n Shark\u0027s with me and thirteen werewolves. He\u0027s covered in blood and smells like the juiciest steak in the world. I need to stay beside him to keep the werewolves in line or they\u0027d fall on him and finish the job their brethren started.\n Timas and Meera are in separate boats, a dozen werewolves to each. Meera\u0027s big-time edgy. Keeps checking over her shoulder to make sure the creatures aren\u0027t sneaking up. Timas, on the other hand, looks as content as any seafaring captain. He sings jaunty songs to his hairy, bemused passengers, and calls for them to join in the choruses. Apart from a few coincidental howls, he\u0027s not having much luck with that. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s going to be a choir of werewolves any time soon.\n \"I don\u0027t like the way they\u0027re looking... at me,\" Shark mutters, a minute or so after regaining consciousness from his latest blackout. \"Like I\u0027m lunch.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" I tell him. \"They\u0027ve already had lunch. Dinner too. You\u0027ll be fine until supper.\"\n \"Funny guy,\" Shark pants, then passes out again.\n I check that Shark\u0027s OK, then focus on Timas in the boat ahead of me. He said he knows where he\u0027s going, that he\u0027s read lots of books about navigation. A while ago I might have been worried, but I trust the oddball now. If we were adrift in a snow storm in Alaska, I\u0027d follow Timas Brauss before I followed an Eskimo.\n Timas guides us safely to dry land, and though we bump about a lot while docking, we come through unscathed. Unloading the werewolves, Timas looks pleased with himself, as he has every right to. An ambulance is waiting. We buckle Shark on to a trolley and roll him into the back of the vehicle. His eyelids flutter open as we\u0027re settling him in place. He looks around, scowls and tries to get up.\n \"Easy,\" I say, pushing him down and tightening the straps around his chest.\n \"I\u0027m not going anywhere,\" he barks. \"I\u0027m coming with you to... help Dervish.\"\n \"You\u0027re in no condition to fight,\" I chuckle.\n \"I don\u0027t care. I\u0027m coming whether you... like it or not.\"\n \"I thought you said you were going to retire when we got off Wolf Island,\" Meera reminds him.\n \"I said I was going to think about it,\" he growls.\n \"Well, think some more on the way to the hospital,\" she snaps and slams the door shut. His curses turn the air blue until the driver switches the siren on and hits the accelerator.\n \"I\u0027m glad I won\u0027t be there when they finish operating on him,\" I note.\n \"Me too,\" Meera says, smiling at me. \"How do you feel?\"\n \"Hungry,\" I reply, then wink at her alarmed expression.\n \"You really believe you can control them?\" Meera asks as we herd the werewolves into the waiting trucks, which will take us to the nearest airport and a specially chartered plane.\n \"Child\u0027s play,\" I smirk.\n Timas is waiting for us at the trucks. He says nothing as I usher in the werewolves, standing by in case I need him. When the last door has been locked, he clears his throat. \"I should keep watch over Shark. He\u0027ll want to return to action as soon as he\u0027s fit-probably before-and he\u0027s going to need help. I can do more for him than you.\"\n \"That\u0027s fine.\" I smile warmly and shake his hand, but lightly, aware that I could crack his fingers like twigs if I squeezed too hard. \"Thanks, Timas. We wouldn\u0027t have made it off the island without you.\"\n \"I know,\" he says, then turns to Meera. \"Time to make good on that promise.\"\n \"What promise?\" Meera squints.\n Timas grabs her and bends her backwards, supporting her with one arm. \"A kiss for your sweet prince,\" he murmurs, smooching up to her.\n Meera pretends to struggle, but then grins and treats him to a kiss that\u0027s even hotter than Shark\u0027s curses. It\u0027s an old-style movie kiss, except with more slurping and tongue action.\n \"Break it up,\" I growl.\n The pair come up for air, their faces red.\n \"That was nice,\" Timas gasps.\n \"Very,\" Meera agrees, and pecks his nose. \"To be continued,\" she purrs, then turns from him with the natural grace of a model and sashays away.\n \"See you soon,\" I mutter.\n \"Extremely soon,\" Timas nods and hits the road, clicking his fingers like a hepcat.\n Meera\u0027s on her mobile for most of the trip to the airport, deep in conversation with some of her fellow Disciples. Her face is creased with worry when she cuts the connection.\n \"Bad news?\" I ask.\n \"There are reports of three potential crossings,\" she says. \"All in major cities. The windows are due to open within the next forty-eight hours unless we can find the mages responsible and stop them.\"\n \"Three at the same time,\" I mutter. \"Hardly coincidence.\"\n \"No,\" Meera snorts. \"One\u0027s in the city where Dervish and Bec are.\"\n \"So Juni must already know that Antoine\u0027s troops failed.\"\n \"I hoped we\u0027d have more time, but apparently not.\" Meera sighs. \"I\u0027ll arrange to have them moved as soon as possible.\"\n \"No.\" My face is stone. \"Let the demons come. I\u0027ll deal with them. It\u0027ll be a good opportunity to test my pack.\"\n \"Are you sure?\" Meera frowns. \"Juni and her masters want the pieces of the Kah-Gash. If you and Bec are in the same spot, they\u0027ll have a double shot at it. Maybe you should stay away from her until-\"\n \"No,\" I growl. \"No more running. They want a fight? I\u0027ll give them one they won\u0027t forget in a hurry.\"\n \"Juni beat you once,\" Meera reminds me.\n \"She won\u0027t again,\" I whisper. Not because I believe I can turn the tables on her, but because she doesn\u0027t want to. She needs me to destroy the universe.\n \"Grubbs?\" Meera says softly. \"Why didn\u0027t Juni finish you off?\"\n I don\u0027t answer. Thinking about what the mutant monster predicted. Wondering, not if it might be true, but rather how it will happen and when.\n \"Grubbs?\" Meera says again.\n I shake myself. \"It doesn\u0027t matter. Are you coming?\"\n Meera sighs. \"No. I want to, but I\u0027m needed elsewhere. I can be of more use in the other cities, either help find the mages and kill them, or try to drive back the demons if they cross. I think we\u0027re all going to have to work very hard over the next few days to prevent a massacre that makes the losses on Wolf Island look like a drop in the ocean.\"\n \"I\u0027ll come when I can,\" I promise. \"Tell the other Disciples that if they fail-if demons break through-I\u0027ll mop up. Once I\u0027ve dealt with those coming to attack Dervish and Bec, I\u0027ll go wherever I\u0027m needed and I\u0027ll bring my werewolves. We can fight them now. We don\u0027t need to be afraid.\"\n \"You idiot,\" Meera chuckles. \"Of course we do.\" She hugs me tight, then stands on her toes, hauls my head down and kisses my coarse, hairy cheek, ignoring the bits of human flesh caught between my fangs and the stench of blood on my breath.\n She releases me and I draw back to my full height. Part of me wants to plead with her to come with me. We can pick up Dervish and Bec, then fly to a deserted island like the one we just left. An apocalypse is coming. It would be easier to sit it out, enjoy what time we have left and face the end with a resigned laugh.\n But I\u0027m Grubbs Grady. Magician. Werewolf. Kah-Gash. I don\u0027t do retreat.\n \"Give my love to Dervish,\" Meera sniffs, then leaves me to make my own way to the plane. The last I see of her, she\u0027s climbing into the front of an army jeep, talking on her mobile, looking lovelier than ever as she prepares to go to war.\n With a self-mocking smile, I offer up a quick prayer to whatever gods might be listening. \"If reincarnation is real, and I die soon, let me come back as Timas Brauss\u0027s lips!\"\n Then I head off in search of my half-dead uncle, hoping he doesn\u0027t croak before I have a chance to bid him goodbye. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wolf-island-the-demonata-8/page-20.html","bookId":2182,"book":{"id":2182,"title":"Wolf Island (The Demonata #8)","description":"Storyline: \n Wolf Island (The Demonata #8) \n As the mysterious Shadow builds an army of demons, Grubbs Grady and his team search desperately for answers.
