{"id":99849,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"It\u0027s chaos downstairs. Juni Swan forced down a helicopter during the duel on the roof. The flames are still flickering, though the teams of firefighters who were quick on the scene have the worst of the blaze under control. Shattered glass from the hospital windows lines the surrounding streets like crystal confetti. The dead and wounded are everywhere, covered in blankets or being nursed by bloodied, shaken medics. Police buzz around like angry bees.\n Shark has no problem talking his way through. A few words with the commanding officer and we\u0027re being escorted past the teams of baying news reporters to a spot in the city where we\u0027re free to go our own way. The Disciples have contacts in some pretty high places.\n First things first-we\u0027re exhausted and need to sleep. We find the nearest hotel and book three connecting rooms. The receptionist regards us warily and almost refuses us entry, but when Shark produces a platinum credit card and says he\u0027ll pay up front, and that he wants their best rooms, the man behind the desk undergoes a swift transformation.\n I\u0027d like to talk through events with Shark and Meera, but both disappear to their beds as soon as we\u0027ve tipped the bellboy and shut the doors, so I\u0027ve no choice but to follow their lead.\n The room\u0027s large, but it feels cramped after a year spent sleeping wild-if not often-beneath vast demonic skies. I open the windows and stick my head out, breathing in fresh air as I replay the scenes from the hospital. Why the hell did I volunteer to stay behind? I could be with Dervish now, catching up, taking care of him. Instead I\u0027ve promised to track down Prae Athim and put a stop to whatever\u0027s going on between Lord Loss and the Lambs. Just how I\u0027m going to do that is a mystery. I spoke before I thought, like an over-eager hero. I\u0027ve been hanging around Beranabus too long!\n Withdrawing, I decide the plans can wait. I go to the toilet, then undress and slide beneath the soft bedcovers. I\u0027m worried I won\u0027t be able to sleep, that I\u0027ll lie awake all night. But within a minute my eyelids go heavy and seconds later it\u0027s lights out.\n Breakfast in bed is heavenly. I eat like a ravenous savage, bolting down sausages, bacon, eggs, mushrooms. And toast! How can a few burnt bits of bread smeared with churned-up cow\u0027s milk taste so delicious?\n There\u0027s a knock on one of the connecting doors while I\u0027m mopping up the juice from my baked beans. \"C\u0027m\u0027 in,\" I grunt.\n Meera appears like an angel, in an ivory-white nightdress. Washed, manicured, the works. You\u0027d never guess that twelve hours earlier she\u0027d been elbow-deep in demon blood.\n \"Wow!\" I exclaim, dropping the toast and clapping.\n She beams and gives me a twirl, then perches on the edge of my bed and picks up the toast. \"Do you mind?\"\n \"Not at all,\" I grin, though I\u0027d have bitten the hand off anybody else who tried to take my last piece.\n \"I\u0027ve been up for hours,\" she says.\n \"You should have woken me.\"\n \"Why? Did you want a manicure too?\"\n \"Very funny. But I could have done with a haircut.\"\n \"That\u0027s for sure,\" she sniffs. \"I ordered some clothes for you. I can\u0027t wait to see you in them. I love dressing up boys, especially fashion-challenged teens.\"\n \"Me? Fashion-challenged? I never used to be.\"\n \"Well, you are now.\" She takes my tray and tugs at the bedsheets. \"Come on. Chop-chop!\"\n \"Whoah!\" I yelp, only just managing to grab on to the sheets in time. \"I\u0027m naked under here!\"\n \"That\u0027s OK,\" she says. \"You sleepwalked into my room last night and did a dance on my rug. I saw it all then.\"\n I stare at her, more horrified than I\u0027ve been in the face of any demon. Then she winks wickedly and races out of the room before I batter her to death with a pillow.\n Shark\u0027s the last to rise. We hold a conference in his room while he tucks into lunch, wearing a robe which just about covers his privates.\n \"So,\" he mumbles through a half full mouth. \"What\u0027s the plan?\"\n I scratch my head and smile sheepishly. \"I kind of hoped you guys would have one...\"\n Shark and Meera share a wry glance.\n \"I thought you were our leader,\" Meera says.\n \"You set the ball rolling,\" Shark agrees. \"We just came along for the ride.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know what to do,\" I grumble. \"It was easy in the demon universe. We cornered demons, beat them up and sometimes killed them. It\u0027s different here. I don\u0027t know where to start. How will we find Prae Athim? It seemed like the simplest thing in the world last night, but now...\"\n \"Not such a big shot in the cold light of day, is he?\" Shark jeers.\n \"Don\u0027t tease him,\" Meera tuts. \"It was brave of him to volunteer.\"\n \"But stupid.\" Shark points a thick finger at me. \"What use are you to us? Why shouldn\u0027t we leave you here and pick you up when it\u0027s all over?\"\n Stung, I focus on the bed. The mattress quivers and comes alive. It throws off the startled Shark, then bucks from the bed and lands on his back, driving him down. He lashes out, bellowing with alarm, but the mattress smashes him flat and pounds at him relentlessly.\n \"Enough,\" Meera says softly, laying a hand on my shoulder.\n I scowl at her, then ease up. I\u0027m sweating slightly.\n A bruised Shark gets to his feet, smoothes his robe and studies me calmly. \"OK, I\u0027m impressed. You\u0027re a magician?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"How powerful are you?\"\n I shrug. \"I never really tested myself on this world. That trick with the mattress tired me, but I could do a lot more.\"\n \"How much more?\" Shark presses.\n \"No idea,\" I answer honestly. \"But in the absence of any windows between universes, I\u0027m stronger than any mage we\u0027ll face.\"\n \"I suppose we might as well bring him along,\" Shark says grudgingly to Meera.\n \"Where do we start?\" Meera asks. \"Do you know where Prae Athim\u0027s based?\"\n \"I never even heard of her before last night,\" Shark says. \"I knew about the Grady werewolves and the Lambs, but they were never my problem. Still, this won\u0027t be the first time I\u0027ve gone looking for someone. We\u0027ll find her.\"\n \"We could do with some help,\" Meera notes. \"They have armed troops, as we saw in Carcery Vale.\"\n \"The Disciples?\" Shark asks.\n \"The Disciples,\" Meera agrees.\n The pair produce mobile phones and start dialling.\n The mages aren\u0027t interested in our mission. This is a bad time for humanity. Demons are attempting to cross faster, and in greater numbers, than ever before. The Disciples are rushed off their feet, dashing from one crisis to another. There have been six successful crossings this year and more than a dozen foiled attempts. And those are only the recorded attacks-more probably went unnoticed. Over five hundred people that we know of have died, not including those at the hospital last night. That\u0027s an average decade\u0027s worth of action.\n The Disciples that Shark and Meera chat with over the course of the day don\u0027t care about werewolves or the Lambs. They don\u0027t even respond when told that Beranabus is involved. Most times, the mere mention of his name is enough to whip them into action. But not now. We can fight our own battles as far as they\u0027re concerned.\n Shark and Meera turn to their other allies when the Disciples fall through. They have a network of contacts-soldiers, politicians, police officers, doctors, etc. They call on them for support when demons cross and create merry hell. The operatives move in to clear up the mess, bury the dead, comfort the survivors, kill the story before it spreads.\n Meera\u0027s contacts are mostly media types and corporate directors. She rings around, asking about the Lambs, but the Grady executioners keep a low profile. She learns that they have several worldwide bases, but Prae Athim could be at any of them.\n Shark takes a different approach. He phones a guy called Timas Brauss and tells him to come as swiftly as possible. He then contacts people in armies or who were once soldiers. He sets about assembling a small unit of men and women with a variety of skills-explosives experts, mechanics, pilots, scuba divers and more. He won\u0027t need them all, but he puts in place a large force to draw from. They\u0027re more cooperative than the Disciples. Shark seems to command a lot of respect in military circles.\n The calls continue into the night. It\u0027s the most frustrating day I\u0027ve spent in a long time. There\u0027s nothing I can do except sit, listen and run errands for Shark or Meera, fetching them food and drink.\n I try to watch TV, but I can\u0027t get comfortable. I\u0027m worried that Shark and Meera will think I\u0027m slacking. Eventually I crawl into bed, tired and grumpy, thinking I should have stayed in the demon universe. At least I served some bloody good over there! \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/wolf-island-the-demonata-8/page-5.html","bookId":2182,"book":{"id":2182,"title":"Wolf Island (The Demonata #8)","description":"Storyline: \n Wolf Island (The Demonata #8) \n As the mysterious Shadow builds an army of demons, Grubbs Grady and his team search desperately for answers.
