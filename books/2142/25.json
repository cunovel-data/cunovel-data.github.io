{"id":95807,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"Drizzt led Sunrise out of Shining White the next morning, well aware that Gerti\u0027s giants were watching his every step. The air was calm and warmer, the sun shining brilliantly against the new-fallen snow.\n The drow stretched and adjusted his clothing and cloak, and the belt that held both his scimitars once more. Not twenty steps from the front, he turned and looked back at Shining White, still amazed that Gerti had stayed true to her word, and that she had cut the deal with him in the first place. He took that as a hopeful sign regarding the future of the region, for Gerti Orelsdottr and her frost giant army apparently held no heart for continuing the war, and perhaps equally important, apparently held no bond of friendship with Obould Many-Arrows. Gerti wanted the orc king dead almost as much as Drizzt did, it seemed, and if that was true of the giantess, might it also be true of some of Obould\u0027s rival orc chieftains? Would attrition play on the massive army, defeating it where the dwarves could not?\n That hopeful thought was quickly replaced by another, for Drizzt realized that if Gerti really could arrange for him to meet Obould, he could accelerate that disintegration of the invading force. Without the orc king as figurehead, the chaotic creatures would turn on each other, day after day and tenday after tenday.\n Drizzt clenched his hands and rolled his fingers, flexing the muscles in his forearms, chasing the last vestiges of the river\u0027s cold bite from his bones. As Innovindil had killed Obould\u0027s son, so he would strike an even greater blow.\n The thought of his elf companion had him shielding his eyes with one hand and scanning the sky, hoping to spot a flying horse. He wanted to spring upon Sunrise\u0027s back and put the pegasus up high to gain a wider view of the region, but Gerti had strictly forbidden that. In fact, Sunrise was wearing a harness that would prevent the pegasus from spreading wide his wings.\n Gerti was offering a bargain, but she was doing it on her terms and with her guarantees.\n Drizzt accepted that with a nod, and continued to scan the skies. He had the pegasus with him. He had his scimitar back from the cold waters, and he had his life. After the disaster of his foray into Shining White, those things were more than he had imagined possible.\n And he might get a fight with the hated Obould. Yes, Drizzt realized, things had worked out quite well.\n So far.\n Gerti sat on her great throne eyeing the giants milling around in the audience chamber. She had surprised them all, she knew, and the looks that came her way reflected suspicion as much as curiosity. Gerti knew that she was gambling. Her father, the great Jarl Orel who had united the many families of giants in the Spine of the World under his iron-fisted rule, lingered near death, leaving Gerti as the heir apparent. But it would be the first transfer of power since the unification, and that, Gerti knew, was no small thing.\n She had followed the advice of Ad\u0027non Kareese and Donnia Soldou and had joined with Obould\u0027s grand ambitions, leading her people out of their mountain homes in forays that were initially intended to be low-risk and short-lived, quick strikes using orc fodder to bear the losses, and frost giants to collect the gains. Ironically, Obould\u0027s successes had upped the ante for Gerti, and dangerously so, she had come to understand as Obould had gained more and more power in their relationship. Obould was making her look small and insignificant to her minions, and that was something Gerti knew she could ill afford. And so she had orchestrated her abandonment of Obould. But even that, she knew, had been a risk. For if the orc king had continued his conquering ways, or even if he could simply solidify and hold onto his already considerable gains, Gerti\u0027s people would have paid an exaggerated price - more than thirty frost giants had died in the campaign - for relatively minor gains in loot. The price Gerti herself would also pay in terms of stature could not be ignored.\n A lone drow had given her an opening to change the equation, and she considered her bargain with Drizzt to be less of a gamble than those around her understood. The price had been nothing more than relinquishing the pegasus - true, the winged horse seemed a shiny bauble, but it was hardly of practical use to her. The gain?\n That was the one variable, and the only part of any of it that seemed a gamble to Gerti. For if Drizzt killed Obould, then Gerti\u0027s abandonment of the orc\u0027s cause would seem prudent and wise, and even more so if Drizzt then followed through with his promise to relay the giantess\u0027s desire for a truce to the formidable enemies that would no doubt rush in to expel the leaderless orcs from their conquered lands. Might Gerti then salvage some practical gains from that ill-advised campaign, perhaps even the opening of trading routes with the dwarves of Mithral Hall?\n The danger lay in the very real possibility that Obould would slay Drizzt, and thus gain even more stature among his subjects, if that was possible. Of course, in that eventuality, Gerti could claim to the orc king that she had delivered Drizzt to him for just that purpose. Perhaps she could even spin it to make it seem as if she, and not Obould, was truly the puppet-master.\n \"The winged horse was more trouble than it was worth,\" Gerti said to a nearby giantess who flashed her one of those suspicious and curious looks.\n \"It was beautiful,\" the giantess replied.\n \"And its beauty would bring an unending string of elves to Shining White, seeking to free it.\"\n More curious looks came at her, for when had Gerti ever been afraid of the lesser races entering Shining White?\n \"Do you really wish to have the elves with their stinging bows sneaking into our home? Or the cunning dwarves digging new tunnels to connect to our lesser-used ways, insinuating themselves among us, popping up by surprise and smashing their ugly little hammers into our kneecaps?\"\n She saw a few nods among the giants as she explained, and Gerti weighed the various looks carefully. She had to play it just right, to make her maneuvering seem clever without reminding them all that her initial blunder had brought all of the risk and trouble to them in the first place. It was all about the message, Gerti Orelsdottr had learned well from her wise old father, and that was a message she meant to tightly control over the next few tendays, until the pain of losses faded.\n If Drizzt Do\u0027Urden managed to kill Obould, that message would be easier to shape to her advantage.\n The same storm that had dumped heavy snows on the mountains near Shining White swirled to the southeast, bringing high winds and driving, cold rain, and whipping the waters of the Surbrin so forcefully that the Felbarran dwarves tied the ferry up on the eastern bank and retreated into sheltering caves. As anxious as they were to be on their way to Silverymoon, the human refugees did not dare to try their luck in the terrible weather, and so they, too, put up in those caves.\n Cottie Cooperson made herself as inconspicuous as possible, staying in the back and at the very edges of the firelight, with Colson fully wrapped in a blanket. The others soon learned of the child, of course, and questioned Cottie.\n \"What\u0027d ye do to its mother?\" one man asked, and he bent low and forced Cottie to look at him squarely, demanding an honest answer.\n \"I seen Delly handing the child to Cottie of her own accord,\" another woman answered for the poor and lost Cooperson lass. \"Right at the dock, and she run off.\"\n \"Run off? Or just missed the ferry?\" the suspicious man demanded.\n \"Run off,\" the woman insisted. \"Of her own choosing.\"\n \"She wanted the child out of Mithral Hall while they\u0027re fighting,\" Cottie lied.\n \"Then the dwarves should know they\u0027ve got an adopted granddaughter of King Bruenor among their passengers,\" the man reasoned.\n \"No!\" shouted Cottie.\n \"No,\" added the supportive woman. \"Delly\u0027s not wanting that stubborn fool Wulfgar to know of it, as he\u0027d be wanting the child back.\"\n It made no sense, of course, and the man stood and turned his glare over the other woman.\n \"Bah! What business is it o\u0027 yer own, anyway?\" she asked.\n \"None,\" another man answered. \"And no one\u0027s a better mother than Cottie Cooperson.\"\n Others seconded that remark.\n \"Then it\u0027s our own secret, and no business to them grumpy dwarves,\" the woman declared.\n \"Ye think Wulfgar\u0027s to be seeing it that way?\" the doubting man argued. \"Ye want the likes o\u0027 that one and his fierce father chasing us across all the lands?\"\n \"Chasing us to what end?\" the woman beside Cottie replied. \"To get his child back? Well then we\u0027ll give him the little girl back, and no one\u0027s to argue.\"\n \"He\u0027ll come with rage in his eyes,\" the man argued.\n \"And it\u0027ll be rage he\u0027ll have to put on his wife, from where I\u0027m sitting,\" said another man. \"She give the child to Cottie to care for, and so Cottie\u0027s to care for the girl. Wulfgar and Bruenor got no right to anything but appreciation in that!\"\n \"Aye!\" several others loudly agreed.\n The doubting man stared at Cottie\u0027s allies long and hard, then turned back to Cottie herself, who was hugging Colson as warmly as any mother ever could hold her own child.\n He could not deny that the sight of Cottie with the child warmed his heart. Cottie, who had been through so very much pain, seemed content for perhaps the first time in all their trials. Even with his fears for the vengeance of Wulfgar, the man could not argue against that simple truth. He gave an accepting smile and a nod.\n All construction of defenses along the mountain spur slowed during those hours of the storm, and the rain and sleet pelted the elves and dwarves who walked their patrols. They even dared to lessen those watches, for no enemies would come against them in the gale - or so they believed.\n Similarly, Ivan and Pikel Bouldershoulder found their progress slowed to a crawl. Pikel\u0027s animal friends, who had guided them far north of the dwarves\u0027 position in pursuit of Delly Curtie, were still hunting at the behest of the doodad, but with lower and shorter flights and with very limited visibility.\n \"Durned fool woman,\" Ivan grumbled over and over again. \"What\u0027s she thinking in running out o\u0027 Mithral Hall?\"\n Pikel squeaked to show his own confusion.\n Ivan kicked at a stone, silently questioning his own decision to chase her out. They were more than a day\u0027s march from the mountain spur, and likely well behind the orc lines, though they hadn\u0027t seen any of the wretches in their march.\n The dwarf truly hoped that they would not have to resort to Pikel\u0027s \"root-walking\" tricks to get back to Bruenor\u0027s boys.\n \"Durned fool woman,\" he grumbled and kicked another stone.\n Compelled by the ever-hungry Khazid\u0027hea, Delly Curtie was among the very few creatures wandering around outside in the cold storm. Exhausted, soaking wet, cold and miserable, the woman never entertained a single thought of finding shelter and stopping her march, because the sword would not let such a notion filter through her mind.\n Khazid\u0027hea held her, fully so. Delly Curtie had become an extension of the sword. Her entire existence was focused upon pleasing Khazid\u0027hea.\n The sword was not appreciative.\n For though Delly was a willing slave, she was not what Khazid\u0027hea coveted most of all: a worthy wielder. And so as darkness fell over the land and Delly\u0027s eyes conveyed to the sword the image of a distant campfire, the weapon compelled her to move toward it with all speed.\n For hours she walked, often falling and skinning her legs, one time slipping on an icy rock so that she slammed her head and nearly knocked herself unconscious.\n What am I doing out here, anyway? I meant to go to Silverymoon, or\n Sundabar, and yet here I am, walking wild lands!\n That flicker of cogent thought only made Khazid\u0027hea reinforce its compulsion over her, dominating her and making her trudge along, one foot in front of the other.\n Khazid\u0027hea felt her fear some time later, when they heard the guttural voices of the encamped creatures, the language of orcs. But the vicious sword took that fear and transformed it, bombarding poor Delly with images of her child being massacred by those same orcs, turning her terror into red rage so completely that she was soon running headlong for the camp. Khazid\u0027hea in hand she burst into the firelight, killing the nearest surprised orc with a single thrust of the fabulous blade, that drove its tip right through a blocking forearm and deep into the orc\u0027s chest.\n Delly yanked the blade free and swiped wildly at the next orc in line, slashing a deep cut through the trunk of a hardwood tree as the creature ducked aside. She pursued wildly, stabbing and slashing, and the orc managed one block, which took the end off its simple spear, before falling back in fear.\n Something hit Delly in the side, but she hardly felt it, so consumed was she, and she pressed forward and stuck the retreating creature in its ugly face again and again, slashing and beating it, sending lines of bright blood flying into the air. She tasted that blood and was too outraged and too consumed to be revolted.\n Again something hit her in the side, and she whirled that way, thinking that an orc was punching at her. A moment of clarity led to a moment of confusion as the woman regarded her attacker, standing across the campfire from her, bow in hand.\n Delly glanced down to her side, to see two arrows deeply embedded, then looked back in time to watch the orc pull back its bowstring once more.\n Khazid\u0027hea overwhelmed her with an image of that very orc biting out Colson\u0027s throat, and the woman shrieked and charged.\n And staggered back from the weight of an arrow driving into her chest.\n With a growl, Delly held her feet, glaring at the archer, stubbornly taking a step toward the orc. She never heard its companion creeping up behind her, never heard the sword rushing for her back.\n She arched, eyes going to the night sky, and a moment of peace came over her.\n She noticed Selune then, gliding overhead, trailed by her glittering tears, through a patch of broken clouds, and she thought it a beautiful thing.\n Khazid\u0027hea fell from her grasp, its sharp tip digging into the ground so that it stayed upright, waiting for a more worthy wielder to take it in its grasp.\n The sword felt its connection with Delly Curtie break completely and knew itself to be an orphan.\n But not for long. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-two-swords-hunter-s-blades-3/page-25.html","bookId":2142,"book":{"id":2142,"title":"The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3) \n In The Two Swords, Obould\u0027s horde has pressed the Companions to the very gates of Mithral Hall, where Bruenor and his clan launch a desperate, last-ditch effort to push the orcs back.
