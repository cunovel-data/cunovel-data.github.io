On your word.\"\n \"Innovindil will understand...\" Drizzt started to argue, but his voice trailed off under Catti-brie\u0027s wilting stare. They had been over it several times already.\n \"You need to close that chapter of your life,\" Catti-brie said to him quietly, taking his hands in her own and lifting them up to her lips to kiss them. \"Your scimitar cut into your own heart as deeply as it cut into Ellifain. You do not return to her for Innovindil. You owe Innovindil and her people nothing, so yes, they will understand. It\u0027s yourself that you owe. You need to return. To put Ellifain to rest and to put Drizzt at peace.\"\n \"How can I leave you now?\"\n \"How can you not?\" Catti-brie grinned at him. \"I do not doubt that you\u0027ll return to me, even if your companion on your journey is a beautiful elf.\n \"Besides,\" the woman went on, \"I\u0027ll not be here in any case. I have promised Wulfgar that I will journey with him to Silverymoon and beyond, if necessary.\"\n Drizzt nodded his agreement with that last part. According to the dwarf ferry pilot, Delly Curtie did come near his craft before it set off for the eastern bank with the refugees from the north, and he did recall seeing the woman hand something, perhaps a baby, over to one of the other human women. He couldn\u0027t be certain who - they all looked alike to him, so he declared.\n Wulfgar wasn\u0027t about to wait until spring to set off in pursuit of Colson, and Catti-brie wasn\u0027t about to let him go alone.\n \"You cannot go with us,\" Catti-brie said. \"Your presence will cause too much a stir in those gossiping towns, and will tell whoever has the child that we\u0027re in pursuit. So you\u0027ve your task to perform, and I\u0027ve mine.\"\n Drizzt didn\u0027t argue any longer.\n \"Regis is staying with Bruenor?\" Drizzt asked.\n \"Someone\u0027s got to. He\u0027s all out of sorts since word that Obould, or an orc acting in Obould\u0027s stead, continues to hold our enemies in cohesion. Bruenor thought they would have begun their retreat by now, but all reports from the north show them continuing their work unabated.\"\n \"The Kingdom of Dark Arrows....\" Drizzt mouthed, shaking his head. \"And Alustriel and all the others will not go against it.\"\n Catti-brie squeezed his hand tighter. \"We\u0027ll find a way.\"\n Sitting so close to her, Drizzt couldn\u0027t believe anything else, couldn\u0027t believe that every problem could not be solved.\n Drizzt found Bruenor in his audience hall a short while later, Regis sitting beside him and the Bouldershoulder brothers, packed for the road, standing before him.\n \"Well met again, ye dark one,\" Ivan greeted the drow. \"Me and me brother ...\" Ivan paused.\n \"Me brudder!\" said Pikel.\n \"Yeah, we\u0027re off for home to see if Cadderly can do something about me ... about Pikel\u0027s arm. Won\u0027t be much fighting to be found up here for a few tendays, at least. We\u0027re thinking to come back and kill a few more orcs.\" Ivan turned to Bruenor. \"If ye\u0027ll have us, King Bruenor.\"\n \"Would any ruler be so foolish as to refuse the help of the Bouldershoulders?\" Bruenor asked graciously, though Drizzt could hear the simmering anger behind Bruenor\u0027s every sound.\n \"Boom!\" shouted Pikel.\n \"Yeah, boom,\" said Ivan. \"Come on, ye green-bearded cousin o\u0027 Cadderly\u0027s pet squirrel. Get me home - and no small roots, ye hear?\"\n \"Hee hee hee.\"\n Drizzt watched the pair depart the hall, then turned to Bruenor and asked, \"Will your kingdom ever be the same?\"\n \"Good enough folk, them two,\" said Bruenor. \"Green-bearded one scares me, though.\"\n \"Boom!\" said Regis.\n Bruenor eyed him threateningly. \"First time ye say \u0027hee hee hee,\u0027 I\u0027m pulling yer eyebrows out.\"\n \"The folk o\u0027 the towns\u0027re going to let them stay, elf,\" the dwarf said, turning back to Drizzt. \"Durned fools\u0027re to let the stinking orcs have what they took.\"\n \"They see no way around it, and no reason to find one.\"\n \"And that\u0027s their folly. Obould, or whatever smelly pig-face that\u0027s taking his place, ain\u0027t to sit there and argue trade routes.\"\n \"I do not disagree.\"\n \"Can\u0027t let them stay.\"\n \"Nor can we hope to dislodge them without allies,\" Drizzt reminded the dwarf.\n \"And so we\u0027re to find them!\" Bruenor declared. \"Ye heading off with Invo ... Inno . .. that durned elf?\"\n \"I promised to take her to Ellifain\u0027s body, that Ellifain might be properly returned to the Moonwood.\"\n \"Good enough then.\"\n \"You know that I will return to you.\"\n Bruenor nodded. \"Gauntlgrym,\" he said, and both Drizzt and Regis were caught off guard.\n \"Gauntlgrym,\" Bruenor said again. \"We three. Me girl if she\u0027s ready and me boy if he\u0027s back from finding his little girl. We\u0027re to find our answers at Gauntlgrym.\"\n \"How do you know that?\" Regis asked.\n \"I know that Moradin didn\u0027t let me come back to sign a treaty with any stinking, smelly, pig-faced orc,\" Bruenor replied. \"I know that I can\u0027t fight him alone and that I ain\u0027t yet convinced enough to fight beside me.\"\n \"And you believe that you will find answers to your dilemma in a long-buried dwarven kingdom?\" asked Drizzt.\n \"I know it\u0027s as good a place to start looking as any. Banak\u0027s ready to take control o\u0027 the hall in me absence. Already put it in place. Gauntlgrym in the spring, elf.\"\n Drizzt eyed him curiously, not certain whether Bruenor was on to something, or if the dwarf was just typically responding to sitting still by finding a way to get back on the road to adventure. As he considered that, however, Drizzt realized that it didn\u0027t much matter which it might be. For he was no less determined than Bruenor to find again the wind on his face.\n \"Gauntlgrym in the spring,\" he agreed.\n \"We\u0027ll show them orcs what\u0027s what,\" Bruenor promised.\n Beside him, Regis just sighed.\n Tos\u0027un Armgo had not been so alone and out of sorts since he had abandoned the Menzoberranzan army after their retreat from Mithral Hall. His three companions were all dead and he knew that if he stayed anywhere in the North, Obould would send him to join them soon enough.\n He had found Kaer\u0027lic\u0027s body earlier that morning, but it was stripped of anything that might be of use to him. Where was he to go?\n He thought of the Underdark\u0027s winding ways, and realized that he couldn\u0027t likely go back to Menzoberranzan, even if that had been his choice. But neither could he stay on the surface among the orcs.\n \"Gerti,\" he decided after considering his course for much of that day, sitting on the same stone where Obould and Drizzt had battled. If he could get to Shining White, he might find allies, and perhaps a refuge.\n But that was only if he could get there. He slipped down from the rock and started moving down the trail to lower ground, sheltered from the wind and from the eyes of any of Obould\u0027s many spies. He found a lower trail and moved along, making his way generally north.\n Do not abandon me! he heard, and he stopped.\n No, he hadn\u0027t actually heard the call, Tos\u0027un realized, but rather he had felt it, deep in his thoughts. Curious, the drow moved around, attuning his senses to his surroundings.\n Here! Left of you. Near the stone.\n Following the instructions, Tos\u0027un soon came upon the source, and he was grinning for the first time in many days when he lifted a fabulous sword in his hands.\n Well met, imparted Khazid\u0027hea.\n \"Indeed,\" said Tos\u0027un, as he felt the weapon\u0027s extraordinary balance and noted its incredibly sharp blade.\n He looked back to where he had found the sword and noted that he had just pulled it from a seam in Obould\u0027s supposedly impenetrable armor.\n \"Indeed. ...\" he said again, thinking that perhaps not all of his adventure had been in vain.\n Nor was Khazid\u0027hea complaining, for it didn\u0027t take the sentient sword long to understand that it had at last found a wielder not only worthy, but of like mind.\n On a clear and crisp winter\u0027s morning, Drizzt and Innovindil set out from Mithral Hall, moving southwest. They planned to pass near to Nesme to see how progress was going on fortifying the city, and cross north of the Trollmoors to the town of Longsaddle, home of the famed wizard family the Harpells. Long allies of King Bruenor, the Harpells would join in the fight, no doubt, when battle finally resumed. And so desperate was Bruenor to find allies - any allies - that he would gladly accept even the help of eccentric wizards who blew each other up nearly as often as they dispatched their enemies.\n Drizzt and Innovindil planned to stay along a generally southwesterly route all the way to the sea, hoping for days when they could put their winged mounts up into the sky. Then they\u0027d turn north, hopefully just as winter was loosening its icy grip, and travel back to the ravine and harbor where Ellifain had been laid to rest.\n That same morning, the ferry made the difficult journey across the icy Surbrin, bearing Wulfgar and Catti-brie, two friends determined to find Wulfgar\u0027s lost girl.\n Bruenor and Regis had seen both pairs off, then had returned to the dwarf king\u0027s private quarters to begin drawing up plans for their springtime journey.\n \"Gauntlgrym, Rumblebelly,\" Bruenor kept reciting, and Regis came to know that as the dwarf\u0027s litany against the awful truth of the orc invasion. The mere thought of the Kingdom of Dark Arrows covering the land to his very doorstep had Bruenor in a terrible tizzy.\n It was his way of escaping that reality, Regis knew, his way of doing something, anything, to try to fight back.\n Regis hadn\u0027t seen Bruenor so animated and eager for the road since the journey that had taken them out of Icewind Dale to find Mithral Hall, those many years ago.\n They\u0027d all be there, all five - six, counting Guenhwyvar. Perhaps Ivan and Pikel would return before the spring and adventure with them.\n Bruenor was too busy with his maps and his lists of supplies to be paying any attention, and so he missed the sound completely when Regis mumbled, \"Hee hee hee.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-two-swords-hunter-s-blades-3/page-33.html","bookId":2142,"book":{"id":2142,"title":"The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3) \n In The Two Swords, Obould\u0027s horde has pressed the Companions to the very gates of Mithral Hall, where Bruenor and his clan launch a desperate, last-ditch effort to push the orcs back.
