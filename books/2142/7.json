{"id":95789,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"\"All the anger of the day,\" Tsinka Shinriil said as she ran her fingers over Obould\u0027s massive shoulder. \"Let it lead you now.\" Then she bit the orc on the back of his neck and began to wrap her sinewy arms and legs around him.\\n\\n Feeling the tautness of her muscles against him, Obould was again reminded of the wild pegasus. Amusing images floated through his mind, but he pushed them away as he easily moved the amorous shaman aside, stepping out into the center of his tent.\\n\\n \"It is much more than a stupid creature,\" he remarked, as much to himself as to Tsinka. He turned to see the shaman staring at him, her bewildered expression so much in contrast to her trembling and naked form.\\n\\n \"The winged horse,\" Obould explained. Tsinka slumped down on a pile of furs. \"More than a horse ... more than the wings ...\" He turned away, nodding, and began to pace. \"Yes... that was my mistake.\"\\n\\n \"Mistake? You are Gruumsh. You are perfect.\"\\n\\n Obould\u0027s grin became an open snicker as he turned back to her and said, \"I underestimated the creature. A pegasus, so it would seem, is much more than a horse with wings.\"\\n\\n Tsinka\u0027s jaw drooped. Obould laughed at her.\\n\\n \"A horse might be clever, but this creature is more,\" said Obould. \"It is wise. Yes! And if I know that...\"\\n\\n \"Come to me,\" Tsinka bade him, and she extended her arm and struck a pose so exaggerated, so intentionally alluring, that Obould found it simply amusing.\\n\\n He went to her anyway, but remained quite distracted as he thought through the implications of his insight. He knew the disposition of the pegasus; he knew that the creature was much more than a stupid horse with wings, for he had come to recognize its stubbornness as loyalty. If he knew that, then the pegasus\u0027s former masters surely knew it, and if they knew it, then there was certainly no way that they would let the imprisonment stand.\\n\\n That thought reverberated through Obould, overshadowing every movement of Tsinka, every bite, every caress, every purr. Rather than diminish in the fog of lust, the images of elves sweeping down to rescue the pegasus only gained momentum and clarity. Obould understood the true value of the creature his minions had captured.\\n\\n The orc king gave a great shout, startling Tsinka. She froze and stared at him, her eyes at first wild and showing confusion.\\n\\n Obould tossed her off to the side and leaped up, grabbing a simple fur to wrap around himself as he pushed through the tent flap and out into the encampment.\\n\\n \"Where are you going?\" Tsinka shrieked at him. \"You cannot go!\"\\n\\n Obould disappeared behind the tent flap as it fell back in place.\\n\\n \"You must not go out without your armor!\" cried Tsinka. \"You are Gruumsh! You are the god! You must be protected.\"\\n\\n Obould\u0027s head poked back in, his eyes and toothy grin wide.\\n\\n \"If I am a god ...\" he started to say, but he left the question there, letting Tsinka reason it out for herself. If he was a god, after all, then why would he need armor?\\n\\n \"Sunrise,\" Innovindil said breathlessly when at long last she saw the marvelous winged horse.\\n\\n Behind her, over the rocky bluff and down the back slope of the mountain spur, Sunset pawed the ground and snorted, obviously aware that her brother and companion was down there in the grassy vale.\\n\\n Innovindil hardly heard the pegasus behind her, and hardly noticed her dark elf companion stirring at her side. Her eyes remained locked on the pegasus below, legs bound as it grazed in the tall brown grass. The elf couldn\u0027t block out recollections of the last time she had seen Sunrise, caught under a net, nor those images that had accompanied that troubling scene. The death of her lover Tarathiel played out so clearly in her mind again. She saw his desperate war dance against Obould and that sudden and stunning end.\\n\\n She stared at Sunrise and blinked back tears.\\n\\n Drizzt Do\u0027Urden put a hand on her shoulder, and when Innovindil finally managed to glance over at him, she recognized that he understood very clearly the tumult within her.\\n\\n \"I know,\" the drow confirmed. \"I see him, too.\"\\n\\n Innovindil silently nodded.\\n\\n \"Let us find a way to take a giant stride toward avenging Tarathiel,\" Drizzt said. \"Above all else, he would demand that we free Sunrise from the orcs. Let us give his spirit some rest.\"\\n\\n Another silent nod, and Innovindil looked back down at the grassy vale. She didn\u0027t focus on the pegasus, but rather on the approach routes that would bring them near to the poor creature. She considered the orc guards milling about, counting half a dozen.\\n\\n \"We could swoop in fast and hard upon Sunset,\" she offered. \"I drop you down right behind Sunrise and cover your movements as you free our captured friend.\"\\n\\n Drizzt was shaking his head before she ever finished. He knew that the large enemy encampment was just over the low ridge on the other side of the vale.\\n\\n \"Our time will be too short,\" he replied. \"If we alert them before we even arrive on the scene, our time to free Sunrise and be away will be shorter still. Frost giants can throw boulders a long, long way, and their aim is usually true.\"\\n\\n Innovindil didn\u0027t argue the point. Her own thinking, in fact, had been moving along those same lines even as she was offering her suggestion. When she looked back at Drizzt, she rested more easily, for she could see the dark elf\u0027s eyes searching out every approach and weighing every movement. Innovindil had already gained tremendous respect for the dark elf. If anyone could pull off the rescue, it was Drizzt Do\u0027Urden.\\n\\n \"Tell Sunset to be ready to come to your whistle,\" the drow said a few moments later. \"Just as when we ... when you, killed Obould\u0027s murderous son.\"\\n\\n Innovindil slid back from the ridge, belly-crawling over the far side to Sunset. When she returned a few moments later, she was greeted by a smiling Drizzt, who was waving his hand for her to follow. He slithered over the stones as easily as a snake, Innovindil close behind.\\n\\n It took the pair nearly half an hour to traverse the mostly open ground of the mountain\u0027s eastern slope. They moved from shadow to shadow, from nook to jag to cranny. Drizzt\u0027s path got them to the valley floor just north of the field where Sunrise grazed, but still with fifty yards of open ground between them and the pegasus. From that better vantage point, they noted two more orc guards, bringing the number to eight.\\n\\n Drizzt pointed to himself, to Innovindil, then to the tall grass, and moved his hand in a slithering, snakelike fashion. When the elf nodded her understanding and began to crouch, the drow held up his hand to stop her. He started to work his fingers in the silent drow code, but stopped short in frustration, wishing that she could understand it.\\n\\n Instead, Drizzt twisted his face and pushed his nose up, trying to look very orclike. Then he indicated the tall grass again and gave an uncertain shrug.\\n\\n Innovindil winked in reply, to show that she had taken his meaning, and as she went back into her crouch, she produced a dagger from her boot and brought it up to her mouth. Holding it between clenched teeth, the elf went down to her belly and moved out of the trees and to the edge of the grass. She glanced back at Drizzt, indicating with her hand that she\u0027d go out to the right, moving west of Sunrise\u0027s position.\\n\\n The drow went into the grass to her left, similarly on his belly, and the two moved along.\\n\\n Drizzt took his movements in bursts of ten elbow-steps, slowly and methodically creeping through the grass, then pausing and daring to lift his head enough to take note of the closest orc guard. He wanted to veer off and go right to that one, to leave it dead in the grass, but that was not the point of their mission. Drizzt fought aside his instinctive rage, against the Hunter within him that demanded continual retribution for the death of Bruenor and the others. He controlled those angry instincts and reminded himself silently that Sunrise was depending on him, that the ghost of Tarathiel, another fallen friend, demanded it of him.\\n\\n He veered away from the orc guard, swerving wide enough to avoid detection and putting himself back in line to approach Sunrise from the east. Soon he was inside the orc guard perimeter. He could hear them all around, chattering in their guttural language, or kicking at the dirt. He heard Sunrise paw the ground and was able to guess that he was still about twenty-five feet from the steed. That distance would likely take him longer than the hundred-plus feet he had come from the trees, he knew, for every movement had to be silent and carefully made so as to not disturb the grass.\\n\\n Many minutes passed Drizzt by as he lay perfectly still, then he dared to place one elbow out in front of him and propel himself a foot forward. He moved slightly back to the west as he made his way, closing the ground, he hoped, between himself and Innovindil.\\n\\n A footstep right before him froze him in place. A moment later, through the grass, he saw a strong, thick orc leg, wrapped in leather and furs.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t dare draw breath.\\n\\n The brutish creature called to its friends - something in its native language spoken too quickly for Drizzt to decipher. The drow did relax just a bit, though, when he heard other orcs respond with a laugh.\\n\\n The orc walked along to the west, moving out of Drizzt\u0027s way.\\n\\n The dark elf paused a bit longer, giving the creature time to completely clear and also making sure that it did not take note of Innovindil.\\n\\n Satisfied, he started to move along once more, but then stopped in surprise at a sudden whinny from Sunrise. The pegasus reared and snorted, front hooves thumping the ground hard. The winged horse neighed again, loudly and wildly, and bucked, kicking the air so forcefully that Drizzt clearly heard the crack of hooves cutting the air.\\n\\n The drow dared lift his head - and quickly realized his mistake.\\n\\n Behind him, up in the trees from which he and Innovindil had just come, he heard the shout of an orc lookout. Before him, the eight guards began to close ranks, and one called out.\\n\\n A noise to the side turned the drow that way - to see more orcs charging over the distant ridgeline.\\n\\n \"A trap,\" he whispered under his breath, hardly believing it possible.\\n\\n To his other side, he caught a burst of movement as Innovindil came up fast behind an orc guard. Her hand, so deceptively delicate, flashed around the surprised creature\u0027s face and pulled its head back, while her other hand came around the other way, the knife\u0027s edge drawing a red line on the creature\u0027s exposed neck.\\n\\n The next nearest orc gave a shout and charged as its companion tumbled down, clutching its mortal wound.\\n\\n Innovindil\u0027s hand snapped forward, launching the already bloody dagger at the incoming orc. With wild gyrations, hands flailing, the orc managed to avoid the missile, but the clever elf was really just looking for a distraction. In a fluid movement, she drew forth her sword and dived into a forward roll, closing the ground between herself and the dodging orc. She came up to her feet gracefully, still moving forward, sword leading and scoring a solid strike into the orc\u0027s chest.\\n\\n But three others charged in at her.\\n\\n Drizzt called upon his innate drow abilities and put a globe of magical darkness in their path, then leaped up and raced to intercept. One of the orcs managed to stop short of the enchanted area, while another simply roared and charged in headlong, and the third veered off to the side.\\n\\n \"Coming through!\" the drow warned his companion, and even as he finished, the charging orc burst out the other side of the darkness globe, barely two strides from the elf.\\n\\n But Drizzt\u0027s warning was enough for Innovindil, and she had her sword angled up before her. As the orc came in hard, spear leading, she parried the tip aside.\\n\\n The orc barreled on, trying to bury her beneath its larger frame, but at the last moment, Innovindil fell to all fours, turning sidelong to the brute. Despite all its efforts, the orc couldn\u0027t slow and couldn\u0027t turn, and it tripped against her and tumbled into a somersault over her.\\n\\n Innovindil couldn\u0027t get back to her feet in time, though, and had to block the sword strike from the next incoming brute from one knee. The orc pressed in harder, chopping viciously at her from varying angles with the sword. The elf had to work her blade frantically to deflect each strike.\\n\\n She gave a shout as another form rushed past her, and it took her a long moment to even realize that it was Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, and another moment to take a measure of the orc that had been pressing her. It was back a few steps suddenly, holding its sword in trembling fingers. As Innovindil watched, red lines of blood thickened on its face and neck.\\n\\n \"They were in wait for us!\" Drizzt called to her, rushing past her again, moving behind her to meet the orc she had tripped up as it stood straight.\\n\\n The orc thrust its spear at his new foe, and hit nothing but air. The perfectly-balanced, quick-moving drow easily slid back and to the side. Then Drizzt came ahead behind that stab, faster than the orc could begin to expect. The orc had never battled the likes of Drizzt Do\u0027Urden before, nor had it ever seen a drow move in battle, let alone a drow wearing enchanted anklets that magically enhanced his foot-speed.\\n\\n Rolling scimitars descended over the helpless creature, slashing line after line across its face and chest. It dropped its spear and tucked its arms in tight, trying somehow to fend off the attacks, but the drow\u0027s fine blades methodically continued their deadly work.\\n\\n Drizzt had hit the retreating orc perhaps two dozen times, then he jumped up and kicked the creature in the chest for good measure, and also to use that movement to reverse his momentum and direction.\\n\\n All thoughts of that orc flew from his mind as he turned around to see Innovindil backing from the remaining four guards. Many, many more orcs were closing ground left, right, and center across the field. Shouts from the trees told Drizzt that the humanoids were behind him as well, and there were louder shouts from not so far away.\\n\\n \"Get to Sunrise!\" Innovindil shouted at Drizzt as he rushed up beside her, contacting her right arm with his left. He offered her an assuring look. He had seen Innovindil and Tarathiel fighting like that, and he and the elf had practiced the technique over the past few days.\\n\\n Innovindil\u0027s doubting expression betrayed her.\\n\\n \"We have no choice,\" Drizzt pointed out.\\n\\n He rolled ahead of the elf to meet the charge of the nearest orc. His scimitars worked furiously, batting at the creature\u0027s weapon, then cutting below its attempted parry, but at a shortened angle that could not reach the orc. The orc didn\u0027t realize that, however, as the drow spun past. In fact, the orc never began to understand the drow\u0027s intent, never began to recognize that the drow had worked his routine and sidelong retreat for no better reason that to set the orc up for the elf who was rolling in behind.\\n\\n All the orc ever figured out was that an elven sword through the ribs hurt.\\n\\n Already engaged with another orc, Drizzt hardly noted the grunt and fall of the first. He held complete confidence in Innovindil, though, and understood that if there was a weak link in the fighting chain that he and the elf had become, it was he. And so Drizzt fought with even more ferocity, scimitars working in a blur, batting away weapons and forcing awkward dodges, setting up the victims for Innovindil as she came in fast and hard behind him just as he was fast in behind her, going with all speed at those orcs Innovindil had left vulnerable for him.\\n\\n Across the field the dancing duo went, moving in tight circles, rolling one upon the other and inexorably toward the trapped pegasus. But with every turn, every different angle coming clearly into his view, Drizzt understood that they would not rescue Sunrise that day. They had underestimated their enemy, had taken the scene of the pegasus grazing beside its handlers at face value.\\n\\n Three more orcs were down. A fourth fell to Drizzt\u0027s double slash, a fifth to Innovindil\u0027s fast turn and stab at a creature that was still watching Drizzt turning aside.\\n\\n When he came around the next time, Drizzt went down to his knees, avoiding an awkward cut from an orc sword. Rather than seizing the opportunity to strike at that overbalanced orc, the drow used the moment of respite to bring forth his onyx figurine. Guenhwyvar had not been gone from his side for long enough, he knew, but he had no choice and so he summoned the panther from her Astral home.\\n\\n He went back to his feet immediately, blades working furiously to regain the edge against increasingly organized attacks. Behind him and Innovindil as they turned on their way, a gray mist began to take shape and solidify.\\n\\n One orc noted that distinctive feline shape and slashed at the mist, its sword crossing through without finding a hold. The frustrated orc growled and reversed its cut, but the mist became more corporeal and a powerful cat\u0027s paw batted the sword aside before it could gain any momentum. Back legs twitching easily, the panther flew into the orc\u0027s face, laying it low, and a quick rake left the brute howling and squirming on the field while mighty Guenhwyvar sprang away to find her next victim.\\n\\n Even the panther would not be nearly enough, though, Drizzt knew, as many more orcs came into view, swarming the field from ...\\n\\n \"Every angle,\" he said to his companion. \"No clear route.\"\\n\\n \"Every angle but one,\" Innovindil corrected, and gave a shrill whistle.\\n\\n Drizzt nodded his understanding at once, and as Innovindil went for the thin rope she kept hooked on her belt, the drow increased his tempo, fighting furiously beside her, forcing the orcs to fall back. He called for his panther to coordinate with him, to keep one flank clear while he assaulted the other.\\n\\n Innovindil had a lasso up spinning hard a moment later, building momentum. Then Sunset appeared in a powerful stoop, coming over the rocky ridge from which Innovindil and Drizzt had first observed the captive Sunrise. The pegasus came down in a rush - a giant-thrown boulder hummed in the air, narrowly missing the equine beast - and leveled out fifteen feet above the grass, soaring past the surprised orcs too quickly for their clumsily thrown spears to catch up.\\n\\n The well-trained pegasus lowered her head as she crossed above Innovindil, who launched her lasso perfectly, then held on, hooking her foot into a loop at the bottom of the twenty-foot length of rope. The pegasus immediately turned upward as she soared along, dragging the elf.\\n\\n Innovindil took a stinging hit as she barreled through the nearest orcs, for one spear was angled just right to slice her hip. Fortunately for the elf, though, that was the only weapon that came to bear as she crashed among the scrambling brutes. Then she was up above them, spinning along as Sunset\u0027s mighty wings beat furiously to gain speed and height.\\n\\n Dazed from slamming against so many, and with her hip bleeding, Innovindil kept the presence of mind to hold fast and begin her climb.\\n\\n Drizzt was too engaged to follow her movements, and he winced more than once as more boulders cut the air above him. Rage propelling him, the drow went into a sudden charge, bursting through the orc ranks and finally getting beside Sunrise.\\n\\n The pegasus\u0027s front hooves were firmly staked. There was no way Drizzt was going to easily free him. And no way for him to get away, it seemed, for the orcs had him fully ringed, shoulder to shoulder in an unbroken line. From somewhere behind those ranks, the drow heard Guenhwyvar cry out in pain, a call so plaintive that he quickly dismissed the panther.\\n\\n He scrambled across the area around Sunrise, charging for the orc ranks, then reversing direction to come back to the pegasus. It all seemed too eerily familiar to him, even more so when the orcs began to chant, \"Obould! Obould! Obould!\"\\n\\n The drow remembered Tarathiel\u0027s last fight, remembered the brutish warrior who had slain his elf friend. He had vowed to avenge that death. But he knew beyond all doubt that it was not the time nor the place. He saw the orcs parting at one point and caught a glimpse of the bone-white helm of his adversary.\\n\\n Drizzt\u0027s knuckles whitened with eagerness as he clenched his scimitars. How he longed to put those fine blades to use on the skull of King Obould Many-Arrows!\\n\\n But there were shamans among the orc ranks, he noted - if he gained advantage on Obould, could he hope to inflict a mortal wound that would not be quickly healed? If he drove the orc king back to disadvantage, would not the orc horde fall over him?\\n\\n He didn\u0027t want to look up and tip his hand for his one hope, but his lavender eyes did glance upward more than once. He noted Innovindil, like a kite string as she and Sunset disappeared behind some trees, and knew beyond doubt that when he saw her again, she would be astride the pegasus.\\n\\n The bone white helmet bobbed behind the front ranks, closer, and the volume and tempo of the chanting steadily increased.\\n\\n Drizzt snapped his head around, as if nervously, but really so that he could cover another quick glance upward.\\n\\n He caught the movement, the shadow. Again he tightened his hands on his scimitars, wanting nothing more than to sink one of those fine blades deep into Obould\u0027s chest.\\n\\n He turned suddenly and leaped upon Sunrise\u0027s strong back, and the pegasus bristled and tried to stamp and turn.\\n\\n \"Will you kill me, Obould?\" the drow cried as he stood tall upon the pegasus\u0027s back, and from that vantage point, he could see the orc king\u0027s head and upper body clearly, the bone helmet with its elongated eyes, the last vestiges of daylight glinting off the translucent lenses. He saw the orc\u0027s magnificent black armor, all ridged, and that amazing greatsword, which Drizzt knew the orc king could cause to burst into flame with but a thought.\\n\\n He saw the foe and Drizzt had to wonder if he could hope to beat Obould even in a different circumstance, even if he and the brute faced each other on neutral ground and without allies to be found.\\n\\n \"Are you mighty enough to defeat me, Obould?\" he called in defiance anyway, for he knew that he had to make himself the focus, had to keep all eyes upon him and had to convince the orc king not to order its orcs to simply swarm him. \"Come along, then,\" the drow boasted, and he flipped one of his scimitars in the air, deftly catching it by the hilt as it came around. \"Long have I desired to see my blades stained red with your flowing blood!\"\\n\\n The last ranks of orcs parted then, leaving the line between Drizzt and Obould clear, and the drow had to consciously force himself to draw breath and to hold steady on his high perch. For the sheer presence of Obould assaulted him, the weight and balance of the creature, the solidity of form and the easy manner with which the king slowly moved his heavy sword with only one hand as if it was as light as an elven walking stick.\\n\\n \"I need you, Sunrise,\" the drow muttered quietly. \"Lift me high, I beg, that I might find my way back to you.\"\\n\\n A quick glance skyward showed Drizzt the return and dive of Innovindil and Sunset, but coming in much higher, the fine rope flowing below.\\n\\n \"Not now, Obould!\" Drizzt screamed, startling many orcs, and he quick-stepped back to Sunrise\u0027s broad rump and kicked the pegasus.\\n\\n Sunrise bucked on cue and Drizzt sprang away, using the lift to launch him high into the air. He snapped his scimitars away as he rose, twisting and turning to line himself up with the approaching rope.\\n\\n \"Another time, Obould!\" he cried as he caught the rope with one hand some twenty feet from the ground. \"You and I, another time!\"\\n\\n The orc king roared and his minions launched spears, stones, and axes up into the air.\\n\\n But again they could not properly lead the swift-moving target, and Drizzt secured his hold, the wind snapping in his ears.\\n\\n From his high vantage point he saw the giants, as did Innovindil and Sunset, obviously, for the pegasus veered as the boulders came sailing out.\\n\\n They climbed higher into the fast-darkening sky, and avoided the barrage enough to get up over the ridge and to safety, both Drizzt and his elf companion having gained new respect for their cunning adversary.\\n\\n Down on the field, Obould watched them disappear with as much amusement as disappointment.\\n\\n Another time, indeed, he knew, and he was not the least bit afraid.\\n\\n Around him, the orcs cheered and hooted.\\n\\n Before him, Sunrise continued to buck and to whinny, and the pegasus\u0027s handlers moved in fast, whips in hand to control the beast.\\n\\n Obould roared at them to steal their momentum.\\n\\n \"With ease and soft hands!\" he demanded.\\n\\n The next day, barely after the sun had cleared the eastern horizon, those handlers came to Obould.\\n\\n \"The beast was not hurt, god-king,\" the lead handler assured him. \"The beast is ready to be ridden.\"\\n\\n With Tsinka Shinriil on his arm, nibbling at his ear, Obould grinned widely at the handler.\\n\\n \"And if the beast throws me again, I will cut off your head,\" he promised, and Tsinka snickered.\\n\\n The handler paled and shrank back.\\n\\n Obould let him squirm uncomfortably for a few moments. The orc king had no intention of going to the captured pegasus that day, or ever again. He knew that he could never ride the beast safely, and knew, too, that he would never again be able to use the pegasus to lure his enemies in close. In short, the winged horse had outlived its usefulness to him - almost.\\n\\n It occurred to the orc king that there might be one last service the captured pegasus could perform. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-two-swords-hunter-s-blades-3/page-7.html","bookId":2142,"book":{"id":2142,"title":"The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3)","description":"Storyline: The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3) \\n In The Two Swords, Obould\u0027s horde has pressed the Companions to the very gates of Mithral Hall, where Bruenor and his clan launch a desperate, last-ditch effort to push the orcs back.
