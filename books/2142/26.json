{"id":95808,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"Drizzt watched the approach of two of Gerti\u0027s messengers from a sheltered dell a mile to the east of Shining White\u0027s entrance. The drow had quickly learned the limits of Gerti\u0027s trust, for he had been told explicitly that he could not remove Sunrise\u0027s harness, and he knew well that his every move was being carefully monitored. If he tried to run away, the giants would rain boulders upon him and the pegasus.\n The drow believed that Gerti trusted him, though, for why would she not? Certainly his desire to do battle with Obould was honestly placed and stated! No, all the \"precautions\" Gerti was taking were more a show for her own people, he understood - or at least, he had to believe. He had been around a wise leader all his life, a dwarf who knew what to do and how to present it - two very different things - and he understood the politics of his current situation.\n Of course, Gerti might just be using him to get a chance at killing Obould, with no intention of ever letting Drizzt and Sunrise go after the battle, whatever the outcome. So be it, Drizzt had to accept, for he had really found no options in that chamber in Shining White. All had been lost, then she\u0027d offered at least a glimmer of hope.\n The two giants entered Drizzt\u0027s dell and tossed a bag of food and a waterskin at his feet.\n \"A substantial force of orcs is moving east of here, along the border of the mountains to a high pass,\" said one, a giantess of no small beauty.\n \"Sent by King Obould to aid in the construction of a large city he plans in that defensible place,\" the other added. Muscular and wide-shouldered even by the standards of his huge race, the male\u0027s face was no less handsome than that of his female companion, with light blue skin and silvery eyebrows that turned into a V whenever he furrowed his brow.\n \"Dark Arrow Keep,\" said the giantess. \"You would do well to remember that name and relay it to your allies should you escape all of this.\"\n The implications of the report were not really surprising to Drizzt. On his journey north to Shining White, he had seen clear signs that the orc king intended to dig in and hold his conquered ground. The construction of a major city, and one in the defensible high ground of the Spine of the World - from which more and more orcs continued to rally to his cause - seemed a logical course to that end.\n \"Obould is not with the caravan, though,\" the giantess explained. \"He is moving from mountain to mountain, overseeing the work on many lesser keeps, and reminding the orcs who they serve.\"\n \"With his shamans,\" added the other. \"And likely a pair of dark elves serve as his wider eyes - are they known to you?\"\n Drizzt\u0027s expression was all the answer the giants needed.\n \"You killed a pair of those drow, we know,\" the giant went on. \"These two are, or were, their companions. They were sent to the south with the troll army, but they will return. They will hold a grievance toward Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, no doubt.\"\n \"Murder and warfare are so common among my people that they just as likely won\u0027t,\" Drizzt replied, and he shrugged as if it didn\u0027t matter, for of course it did not. If the two drow were with Obould, then they were already his enemies.\n \"We will move in the morning,\" the giantess said. \"Gerti hopes to meet up with Obould within three days.\"\n She wants him dead before his grand designs can take real shape, Drizzt thought, but did not reply.\n Every added bit of information about Obould\u0027s movements reinforced Gerti\u0027s deal with him. The giantess saw a war coming beyond anything in her power to influence. Or, in the absence of that war, she saw her own position greatly diminishing before the rise of King Obould Many-Arrows.\n Delivering Drizzt to Obould might prove a gamble to Gerti, Drizzt understood, for it was likely that Obould\u0027s stature would only climb if he proved victorious. The fact that Gerti was willing to take that chance showed Drizzt just how desperate she was becoming.\n Obould was taking full control, so Gerti believed that she had nothing to lose.\n The drow thought it odd that his victory over Obould would so greatly benefit Gerti Orelsdottr, a giantess he would hardly claim as an ally in any cause. He remembered the bombardment of Shallows, the callous disregard Gerti\u0027s warriors had shown for the poor besieged people of the village as they had launched boulder after boulder their way.\n Yet, if he proved victorious and killed Obould, and the orc forces began to scatter and turn on themselves in the absence of a strong leader, Drizzt was then bound to parlay on behalf of those same giants for a truce.\n The drow nodded grimly and accepted the notion then in his heart, as he had previously accepted it in his thoughts when his very life had been at stake. Better for everyone if the war could simply end, if the dark swarm of orcs could be pushed back into their holes and the land reclaimed for the goodly folk. What gain would there be in then pursuing an attack upon Shining White, in which hundreds of dwarves and their allies would be slain?\n \"Are you ready to fight him?\" the giantess asked, and when Drizzt looked at her, he realized he\u0027d been so wrapped up in his thoughts that he\u0027d missed the question the first few times she\u0027d asked it.\n \"Three days,\" he agreed. \"Obould will die in three days.\"\n The giant and giantess looked to each other and grinned, then walked off.\n Drizzt replayed his pledge many times, letting it permeate his bones and his heart, letting it become a litany against all the pain and loss.\n \"Obould will die in three days,\" he repeated aloud, and his lips curled hungrily.\n The two giants down the trail to his right kept Sunrise under close guard, but they were not holding Drizzt\u0027s attention that cold and clear morning. Up to his left, on a barren and rocky hilltop, Gerti Orelsdottr and King Obould stood in the sunlight, talking and arguing.\n She had orchestrated all of it, had set Drizzt in place within an easy and swift climb to the appointed spot, then had brought Obould out here alone for a parlay.\n The orc didn\u0027t seem suspicious at all to Drizzt, he appeared at ease and supremely confident. Obould had been a bit on his guard when he and Gerti first arrived at the hilltop, but after a few minutes of pointing and talking, the orc visibly relaxed.\n They were discussing the construction of defenses, Drizzt knew. All the way out there, a full four days of marching south from Shining White, Drizzt had witnessed the unveiling of King Obould\u0027s grand designs. Many hilltops and mountainsides were under construction in the north, with rock walls taking shape and the bases of large keeps already set in place. On an adjoining mound to the one where the two principals stood, a hundred orcs toiled at the stone, preparing strong defenses.\n Those sights only heightened Drizzt\u0027s sense of urgency. He wanted to kill Obould for what the orc had done to his friends and to the innocents of the North; he needed to kill Obould for the sake of those remaining. It was not the behavior that Drizzt had come to expect from an orc. Many times, even back in Menzoberranzan, he had heard others remark that the only thing truly subjugating goblinkind to the other races was the lack of cohesion on their part. Even the superior minded matron mothers of Menzoberranzan had remained leery of their goblin and orc slaves, knowing that a unified force of the monsters, weak as they might be individually, could prove to be an overwhelming catastrophe.\n If Obould truly was that unifying force, at least in the Spine of the World, he had to die.\n Many minutes passed, and Drizzt subconsciously grasped at his scimitar hilts. He glanced nervously at the adjoining hilltop, where several other orcs - shamans, they appeared - kept a watch on their leader, often moving to the closest edge and peering across at the two figures. Their interest had faltered over the past few minutes, but Drizzt knew that would likely be a temporary thing.\n \"Hurry up, Gerti,\" he whispered.\n The drow stepped back into the shadows, startled, for almost as if she had heard his plea, Gerti turned away from Obould and stormed off, moving down the mountainside with swift, long strides.\n So surprised was he that Drizzt nearly missed the moment. Obould, apparently caught off his guard by Gerti\u0027s sudden retreat, stood there gaping at her, hands on his hips, eyes staring out from behind that curious skull-like helm with its oversized, glassy goggles.\n The drow shook himself from his hesitation and bounded up the slope, moving fast and silently. He came atop the hillock just a few strides from the orc, and thought for a moment to rush in and stab his enemy before Obould even knew he was there.\n But the orc king spun on him, and Drizzt had skidded to a stop anyway.\n \"I had thought you would never dare to stand without an ally,\" the drow said, and his scimitars appeared in his hands - almost magically, it seemed, so fast and fluid was his movement.\n A low growl escaped Obould\u0027s lips as he regarded the drow.\n \"Drizzt Do\u0027Urden?\" he asked, the growling rumble continuing through every syllable.\n \"It is good that you know my name,\" Drizzt answered, and he began to stalk to the side, Obould turning to keep him squarely in line. \"I want you to know. I want you to understand why you die this morning.\"\n So sinister was Obould\u0027s chuckle that it hardly deviated from the continuing growl. He reached his right hand up slowly and deliberately over his left shoulder, grasped the large hilt of his greatsword, and slowly drew it up. The top edge of his scabbard was cut halfway up its length, so as soon as the sword tip broke free of the sheath, Obould snapped the sword straight up then down and across before him.\n Drizzt heard a shout from the other hillock, but it didn\u0027t matter. Not to him, and not to Obould. Drizzt heard a larger commotion, and glanced to see several orcs running his way, and several others lifting bows, but Obould raised his hand out toward them and they skidded to a stop and lowered their weapons. The orc king wanted the fight as much as he did.\n \"For Bruenor, then,\" Drizzt said, and he didn\u0027t piece together the implications of the scowl that showed in Obould\u0027s bloodshot yellow eyes.\n \"For Shallows and all who died there.\"\n He kept circling and Obould kept turning.\n \"For the Kingdom of Dark Arrows,\" Obould countered. \"For the rise of the orcs and the glory of Gruumsh. For our turn in the sunlight that the dwarves, elves, and humans have too long claimed as their own!\"\n The words sent an instinctual shiver down Drizzt\u0027s spine, but the drow was too wrapped up in his anger to fully appreciate the orc\u0027s sentiment.\n Drizzt was trying to take a complete measure of his enemy, trying to look over the orc\u0027s fabulous armor to find some weakness. But the drow found himself locked by the almost hypnotic stare of Obould, by the sheer intensity of the great leader\u0027s gaze. So held was he, that he was hardly aware that Obould had started to move. So frozen was Drizzt by those bloodshot eyes, that he only moved at the very last second, throwing his hips back to avoid being cut in half by the sidelong swipe of the monstrous sword.\n Obould pressed forward, whipping a backhand slash, then pulling up short and stabbing once, twice, thrice, at the retreating drow.\n Drizzt turned and dodged, his feet quick-stepping, keeping him in balance as he backed. He resisted the urge to intercept the stabbing and slashing sword with one of his own blades, realizing that Obould\u0027s strokes were too powerful to be parried with one hand. The drow was using the moments as Obould pressed his attack to fall into his own rhythm. As he sorted out his methods, he realized it would be better to hold complete separation. So he kept his scimitars out to the side, his arms out wide, his agility and feet alone keeping Obould\u0027s strikes from hitting home.\n The orc king roared and pressed on even more furiously, almost recklessly. He stabbed and stepped ahead, whipped his sword out one way then rushed ahead in a short burst as he slashed across. But Drizzt was quicker moving backward than Obould was in coming forward, and the orc got nowhere close to connecting. And the seasoned drow warrior, his balance perfect as always, let the blade go by and reversed his momentum in the blink of a bloodshot eye.\n He ran right past Obould, veering slightly as the orc tried to shoulder-block him. A double-stab drove both his scimitars against Obould\u0027s side, and when the armor stopped them, Drizzt went into a sudden half-turn, then back again, slashing higher, one blade after the other, both raking across the orc king\u0027s eye plate.\n Obould came around with a howl, his greatsword cutting the air - but only the air, for Drizzt was well out of range.\n The drow\u0027s smile was short-lived, however, when he saw that his strikes, four solid hits, had done nothing, had not even scratched the translucent eye plate of the skull-like helm.\n And Obould was on him in a flash, forcing him to dive and dodge, and even to parry once. The sheer force of Obould\u0027s strike sent a numbing vibration humming through the drow\u0027s arm. Another opening presented itself and Drizzt charged in, Twinkle cutting hard at the grayish wrap Obould wore around his throat.\n And Drizzt, scoring nothing substantial at all, nearly lost some of his hair as he dived forward, just under the tremendous cut of the heavy greatsword. It occurred to Drizzt as he came around to face yet another brutal assault that his openings had been purposefully offered, that Obould was baiting him in.\n It made no sense to him, and as he threw his hips left and right and back, and even launched himself into a sidelong somersault at one point, he kept studying the brute and his armor, searching desperately for some opening. But even Obould\u0027s legs seemed fully entombed in the magnificent armor.\n Drizzt leaped up high as the greatsword cut across below him. He landed lightly and charged forward at his foe, and Obould instinctively reacted by throwing his sword across in front of him.\n The greatsword burst into flame, but the startled Drizzt reacted perfectly, slapping Icingdeath across it.\n The magic of the scimitar overruled the fires of the greatsword, extinguishing them in a puff of angry gray smoke, and it was Obould, suddenly, who was caught by surprise, just as he had started forward to overwhelm the drow. His hesitation gave Drizzt yet another opening, and the drow took a different tact, diving low and wedging himself between the orc\u0027s legs, thinking to spin and twist and send Obould tumbling away.\n How might the armored turtle fight while lying on its back?\n That clever thought met with the treelike solidity of King Obould\u0027s legs, for though Drizzt hit the orc full force, Obould\u0027s foot did not slip back a single inch.\n Though dazed, the drow knew he had to move at once, before Obould could bring the sword around and skewer him where he crouched. He started to go, and realized he was quick enough to escape that blade.\n But so did Obould, and so the orc did not focus on his sword, but rather kicked out hard. His armored foot crunched into the drow\u0027s chest and sent Drizzt flying back ten feet to land hard on his back. Gasping for breath that would not come, Drizzt rolled aside just as Obould\u0027s sword came down, smashing the stone where he\u0027d just been lying.\n The drow moved with all speed, twisting and turning, putting his feet under him, and throwing himself aside to barely avoid another great slash.\n He couldn\u0027t fully avoid a second kick as the orc went completely on the offensive. The clip, glancing at it was, sent him tumbling once more. The drow finally straightened out enough to throw himself into a backward roll that put him on his feet once more, squarely facing the charging orc.\n Drizzt yelled and charged, but only a single step before he burst out to the side.\n He couldn\u0027t win, so he ran.\n Down the side of the stony hill he went, the shouts of the orcs form the other hill and the taunts of Obould chasing him every step. He cut a fast turn around a jag in the stone, wanting to get out of sight of the archers, then cut again onto a straight descending path. His heart leaped when he saw Sunrise waiting for him, pawing the ground. As he neared, he realized that the pegasus was no longer wearing the harness.\n Sunrise started running even as Drizzt leaped astride, and only a few steps off, the horse leaped into the air and spread his great wings, taking flight.\n Gerti led the barrage, launching a stone that soared high into the air, not far behind the flying horse and drow rider. Her dozen escorting giants let fly as well, filling the air with boulders.\n Not one scored a hit on the drow, though, for Gerti\u0027s instructions had been quite clear. As the pegasus banked, the giantess managed to catch the drow\u0027s attention, and his slight nod confirmed everything between them.\n \"He failed us, so why not kill him?\" the giant beside Gerti asked.\n \"His hatred for Obould will only grow,\" the giantess explained. \"He will try again. His role in this drama is not yet done.\"\n She looked back to the hillock as she spoke, to see Obould standing imperiously, his greatsword raised in defiance, and behind him, the shamans and other orcs howled for him, and for Gruumsh.\n Gerti looked back to Drizzt and hoped her prediction would prove correct.\n \"Find a way to kill him, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden,\" she whispered, and she recognized the desperation in her own voice and was not pleased.\n PART FOUR\n THE BALANCE OF POWER\n There is a balance to be found in life between the self and the community, between the present and the future. The world has seen too much of tyrants interested in the former, selfish men and women who revel in the present at the expense of the future. In theoretical terms, we applaud the one who places community first, and looks to the betterment of the future.\n After my experiences in the Underdark, alone and so involved in simple survival that the future meant nothing more than the next day, I have tried to move myself toward that latter, seemingly desirable goal. As I gained friends and learned what friendship truly was, I came to view and appreciate the strength of community over the needs of the self. And as I came to learn of cultures that have progressed in strength, character, and community, I came to try to view all of my choices as an historian might centuries from now. The long-term goal was placed above the short-term gain, and that goal was based always on the needs of the community over the needs of the self.\n After my experiences with Innovindil, after seeing the truth of friends lost and love never realized, I understand that I have only been half right.\n \"To be an elf is to find your distances of time. To be an elf is to live several shorter life spans.\" I have learned this to be true, but there is something more. To be an elf is to be alive, to experience the joy of the moment within the context of long-term desires. There must be more than distant hopes to sustain the joy of life.\n Seize the moment and seize the day. Revel in the joy and fight all the harder against despair.\n I had something so wonderful for the last years of my life. I had with me a woman whom I loved, and who was my best of friends. Someone who understood my every mood, and who accepted the bad with the good. Someone who did not judge, except in encouraging me to find my own answers. I found a safe place for my face in her thick hair. I found a reflection of my own soul in the light in her blue eyes. I found the last piece of this puzzle that is Drizzt Do\u0027Urden in the fit of our bodies.\n Then I lost her, lost it all.\n And only in losing Catti-brie did I come to see the foolishness of my hesitance. I feared rejection. I feared disrupting that which we had. I feared the reactions of Bruenor and later, when he returned from the Abyss, of Wulfgar.\n I feared and I feared and I feared, and that fear held back my actions, time and again.\n How often do we all do this? How often do we allow often irrational fears to paralyze us in our movements. Not in battle, for me, for never have I shied from locking swords with a foe. But in love and in friendship, where, I know, the wounds can cut deeper than any blade.\n Innovindil escaped the frost giant lair, and now I, too, am free. I will find her. I will find her and I will hold onto this new friendship we have forged, and if it becomes something more, I will not be paralyzed by fear.\n Because when it is gone, when I lay at death\u0027s door or when she is taken from me by circumstance or by a monster, I will have no regrets.\n That is the lesson of Shallows.\n When first I saw Bruenor fall, when first I learned of the loss of my friends, I retreated into the shell of the Hunter, into the instinctual fury that denied pain. Innovindil and Tarathiel moved me past that destructive, self-destructive state, and now I understand that for me, the greatest tragedy of Shallows lies in the lost years that came before the fall.\n I will not make that mistake again. The community remains above the self; the good of the future outweighs the immediate desires. But not so much, perhaps. There is a balance to be found, I know now, for utter selflessness can be as great a fault as utter selfishness, and a life of complete sacrifice, without joy, is, at the end, a lonely and empty existence. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-two-swords-hunter-s-blades-3/page-26.html","bookId":2142,"book":{"id":2142,"title":"The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3) \n In The Two Swords, Obould\u0027s horde has pressed the Companions to the very gates of Mithral Hall, where Bruenor and his clan launch a desperate, last-ditch effort to push the orcs back.
