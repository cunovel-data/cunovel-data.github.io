{"id":95787,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"To all in the chamber, the torchlight did not seem so bright, its flickering flames did not dance so joyously. Perhaps it was the realization that the doors were closed and that the meager light was all that separated the whole of the great dwarven complex of Mithral Hall from absolute darkness. The dwarves and others could get out, of course. They had tunnels that led to the south and the edge of the Trollmoors, though there had reportedly been some fighting down there already. They had tunnels that would take them as far west as Mirabar, and right under the River Surbrin to the east, to places like Citadel Felbarr. None of those were easy routes, though, and all involved breaking into that vast labyrinth known as the Underdark, the place of dark denizens and untold horrors. So Mithral Hall seemed a darker place, and the torches less inviting, and less frequent. King Bruenor had already ordered conservation, preparing himself for what surely seemed to be a long, long siege. Bruenor sat on a throne of stone, thickly padded with rich green and purple cloth. His great and wild beard seemed more orange than red under the artificial lighting, perhaps because those long hairs had become noticeably more infested with strands of gray since the dwarf king\u0027s ordeal. For many days, Bruenor had lain close to death. Even the greatest clerics of Mithral Hall had only thought him alive through their nearly continual healing spells, cast upon a body, they believed, whose host had forsaken it. Bruenor, the essence of the dwarf, his very soul, had gone to his just reward in the Halls of Moradin, by the reckoning of the priests. And there, so it was supposed, Regis the halfling steward had found him, using the magic of his enchanted ruby pendant. Regis had caught what little flicker of life remaining in Bruenor\u0027s eyes and somehow used the magic to send his thoughts and his pleas for Bruenor to return to the land of the living. For no king would lie so still if he knew that his people were in such dire need. Thus had Bruenor returned, and the dwarves had found their way home, albeit over the bodies of many fallen comrades. Those gray hairs seemed to all who knew him well to be the only overt sign of Bruenor\u0027s ordeal. His dark eyes still sparkled with energy and his square shoulders promised to carry the whole of Mithral Hall upon them, if need be. He was bandaged in a dozen places, for in the last retreat into the hall, he had suffered terrible wounds - injuries that would have felled a lesser dwarf - but if any of those wounds caused him the slightest discomfort, he did not show it. He was dressed in his battle-worn armor, creased and torn and scratched, and had his prized shield, emblazoned with the foaming mug standard of his clan, resting against the side of his throne, his battle-axe leaning atop it and showing the notches of its seasons, chips from stone, armor, and ogre skulls alike. \"All who seen yer blast just shake their heads when they try to describe it,\" Bruenor said to Nanfoodle Buswilligan, the gnome alchemist from Mirabar. Nanfoodle stepped nervously from foot to foot, and that only made the stout dwarf lean closer to him. \"Come on now, little one,\" Bruenor coaxed. \"We got no time for humility nor nervousness. Ye done great, by all accounts, and all in the hall\u0027re bowing to ye in respect. Ye stand tall among us, don\u0027t ye know?\" Nanfoodle did seem to straighten a bit at that, tilting his head back slightly so that he looked up at the imposing dwarf upon the dais. Nanfoodle twitched again as his long, crooked, pointy nose actually brushed Bruenor\u0027s similarly imposing proboscis. \"What\u0027d ye do?\" Bruenor asked him again. \"They\u0027re saying ye brought hot air up from under Keeper\u0027s Dale.\" \"I... we ...\" Nanfoodle corrected, and he turned to regard some of the others, including Pikel Bouldershoulder, the most unusual dwarf who had come from Carradoon on the shores of faraway Impresk Lake. Nanfoodle nodded as Pikel smiled widely and punched his one fist up into the air, mouthing a silent, \"Oo oi!\" The gnome cleared his throat and turned back squarely upon Bruenor, who settled back in his chair. \"We used metal tubing to bring the hot air up from below, yes,\" the gnome confirmed. \"Torgar Hammerstriker and his boys cleared the tunnels under the ridge of orcs and painted it tight with pitch. We just directed the hot air into those tunnels, and when Catti-brie\u0027s arrow ignited it all...\" \"Boom!\" shouted Pikel Bouldershoulder, and all eyes turned to him in surprise. \"Hee hee hee,\" the green-bearded Pikel said with a shy shrug, and all the grim folk in the room joined in on the much-needed laugh. It proved a short respite, though, the weight of their situation quickly pressing back upon them. \"Well, ye done good, gnome,\" Bruenor said. \"Ye saved many o\u0027 me kin, and that\u0027s from the mouth o\u0027 Banak Brawnanvil himself. And he\u0027s not one to throw praise undeserved.\" \"We - Shoudra and I - felt the need to prove ourselves, King Bruenor,\" said Nanfoodle. \"And we wanted to help, any way we could. Your people have shown such generosity to Torgar and Shingles, and all the other Mirabarran - \" \"Mirabarran, no more,\" came a voice, Torgar\u0027s voice, from the side. \"We are Battlehammer now, one and all. We name not Marchion Elastul as our enemy, unless an enemy he makes of us, but neither are we loyal to the throne of Mirabar. Nay, our hearts, our souls, our fists, our hammers, for King Bruenor!\" A great cheer went up in the hall, started by the dozen or so formerly Mirabarran dwarves in attendance, and taken up by all standing around the room. Bruenor basked in that communal glow for a bit, welcoming it as a needed ray of light on that dark day. And indeed, the day was dark in Mithral Hall, as dark as the corridors of the Underdark, as dark as a drow priestess\u0027s heart. Despite the efforts, the sacrifice, the gallantry of all the dwarves, of Catti-brie and Wulfgar, despite the wise choices of Regis in his time as steward, they had been put in their hole, sealed in their tunnels, by a foe that Mithral Hall could not hope to overcome on an open field of battle. Hundreds of Bruenor\u0027s kin were dead, and more than a third of the Mirabarran refugees had fallen. Bruenor had entertained a line of important figures that day, from Tred McKnuckles of Felbarr, stung by the loss of his dear friend Nikwillig, to the Bouldershoulder brothers, Ivan and the indomitable Pikel, giggling always and full of cheer despite the loss of his arm. Bruenor had gone to see Banak Brawnanvil, the warcommander who had so brilliantly held the high ground north of Keeper\u0027s Dale for days on end against impossible odds. For Banak could not come to him. Sorely wounded in the final escape, insisting on being the last off the cliff, Banak no longer had any use of his legs. An orc spear had severed his backbone, so said the priests, and there was nothing their healing spells could do to fix it. He was in his bed that day, awaiting the completion of a comfortable chair on wheels that would allow him a bit of mobility. Bruenor had found Banak in a dour mood, but with his fighting spirit intact. He had been more concerned about those who had fallen than with his own wounds, as Bruenor expected. Banak was a Brawnanvil, after all, of a line as sturdy as Battlehammer\u0027s own, strong of arm and of spirit, and with loyalty unmatched. Banak had been physically crippled, no doubt, but Bruenor knew that the warcommander was hardly out of the fight, wherever that fight may be. Nanfoodle\u0027s audience marked the end of the announced procession that day, and so Bruenor dismissed the gnome and excused himself. He had one more meeting in mind, one, he knew, that was better made in private. Leaving his escort - Thibbledorf Pwent had insisted that a pair of Gut-busters accompany the dwarf king wherever he went - at the end of one dimly lit corridor, Bruenor moved to a door, gently knocked, then pushed it open. He found Regis sitting at his desk, chin in one hand the other holding a quill above an open parchment that was trying to curl against the press of mug-shaped paperweights. Bruenor nodded and entered, taking a seat on the edge of the halfling\u0027s soft bed. \"Ye don\u0027t seem to be eatin\u0027 much, Rumblebelly,\" he remarked with a grin. Bruenor reached under his tunic and pulled forth a thick piece of cake. He casually tossed it to Regis, who caught it and set it down without taking a bite. \"Bah, but ye keep that up and I\u0027m to call ye Rumblebones!\" Bruenor blustered. \"Go on, then!\" he demanded, motioning to the cake. \"I\u0027m writing it all down,\" Regis assured him, and he brushed aside one of the paperweights and lifted the edge of the parchment, which caused a bit of the recently placed ink to streak. Noting this, Regis quickly flattened the parchment and began to frantically blow upon it. \"Ain\u0027t nothing there that ye can\u0027t be telling me yerself,\" Bruenor said. Finally, the halfling turned back to him. \"What\u0027s yer grief then, Rumblebelly?\" asked the dwarf. \"Ye done good - damn good, by what me generals been telling me.\" \"So many died,\" Regis replied, his voice barely a whisper. \"Aye, that\u0027s the pain o\u0027 war.\" \"But I kept them out there,\" the halfling explained, leaping up from his chair, his short, stocky arms waving all around. He began to pace back and forth, muttering with every step as if trying to find some way to blurt out all of his pain in one burst. \"Up on the cliff. I could have ordered Banak back in, long before the final fight. How many would still be alive?\" \"Bah, ye\u0027re asking questions that ain\u0027t got no answers!\" Bruenor roared at him. \"Anyone can lead the fight the day after it\u0027s done. It\u0027s leading the fight during the fight that\u0027s marking yer worth.\" \"I could have brought them in,\" the halfling stated. \"I should have brought them in.\" \"Ah, but ye knew the truth of the orc force, did ye? Ye knew that ten thousand would add to their ranks and sweep into the dale from the west, did ye?\" Regis blinked repeatedly, but did not answer. \"Ye knew nothing more than anyone else, Banak included,\" Bruenor insisted. \"And Banak wasn\u0027t keen on coming down that cliff. In the end, when we learned the truth of our enemy, we salvaged what we could, and that\u0027s plenty, but not as much as we wanted to hold. We gived them the whole of the northland don\u0027t ye see? And that\u0027s nothing any Battlehammer\u0027s proud to admit.\" \"There were too many ...\" Regis started, eliciting another loud \"Bah!\" from Bruenor. \"We ran away, Rumblebelly! Clan Battlehammer retreated from orcs!\" \"There were too many!\" Bruenor smiled and nodded, showing Regis that he had just been played like a dwarven fiddle. \"Course there were, and so we took what we could get, but don\u0027t ye ever think that running from orcs was something meself\u0027d order unless no other choice was afore me. No other choice! I\u0027d\u0027ve kept Banak out there, Rumblebelly. I\u0027d\u0027ve been out there with him, don\u0027t ye doubt!\" Regis looked up at Bruenor and gave a nod of appreciation. \"Questions for us now are, what next?\" said Bruenor. \"Do we go back out and fight them again? Out to the east, mayhaps, to open a line across the Surbrin? Out to the south, so we can sweep back around?\" \"The south,\" Regis muttered. \"I sent fifty to the south, accompanying Galen Firth of Nesme.\" \"Catti-brie telled me all about it, and in that, too, ye did well, by me own reckoning. I got no love for them Nesme boys after the way they treated us them years ago and after the way they ignored Settlestone. Bunch o\u0027 stone-heads, if e\u0027er I seen a bunch o\u0027 stoneheads! But a neighbor\u0027s a neighbor, and ye got to help do what ye can do, and from where I\u0027m seeing it, ye did all that ye could do.\" \"But we can do more now,\" Regis offered. Bruenor scratched his red beard and thought on that a moment. \"Might that we can,\" he agreed. \"A few hundred more moving south might open new possibilities, too. Good thinking.\" He looked to Regis as he finished, and noted happily that the halfling seemed to have shaken off his burden then, an eager gleam coming back into his soft brown eyes. \"Send Torgar and the boys from Mirabar,\" Regis suggested. \"They\u0027re a fine bunch, and they know how to fight aboveground as well as below.\" Bruenor wasn\u0027t sure if he agreed with that assessment. Perhaps Torgar, Shingles, and all the dwarves of Mirabar had seen enough fighting and had taken on enough special and difficult assignments already. Maybe it was time for them to take some rest inside Mithral Hall proper, mingling with the dwarves who had lived in those corridors and chambers since the complex had been reclaimed from Shimmergloom the shadow dragon and his duergar minions years before. Bruenor gave no indication to Regis that he was doubting the wisdom of the suggestion, though. The halfling had proven himself many times over in the last tendays, by all accounts, and his insight and understanding was a resource Bruenor had no intention of squashing. \"Come along, Rumblebelly,\" he said with a toothy grin. \"Let\u0027s go see how Ivan and Pikel are getting on. Might be that they know allies we haven\u0027t yet considered.\" \"Cadderly?\" \"Was thinking more of the elves of the Moonwood,\" Bruenor explained. \"Seems them two came through there on their way to Mithral Hall. I\u0027m thinking it\u0027d be a good thing to get them elves putting arrows and magic across the Surbrin to soften our enemy\u0027s entrenchment.\" \"How would we get word to them?\" Regis asked. \"The elves, I mean. Do we have tunnels that go that far east and north?\" \"How\u0027d Pikel get him and Ivan there in the first place?\" Bruenor replied with an exaggerated wink. \"By Ivan\u0027s telling, it\u0027s got something to do with trees and roots. We ain\u0027t got no trees, but we got plenty o\u0027 roots, I\u0027m thinking.\" Regis put on his best Pikel voice when he replied, \"Hee hee hee.\" Tred McKnuckles emphatically raised a finger to his pursed lips, reminding the dwarven catapult team that silence was essential. Bellan Brawnanvil mimicked the movement back to Tred in agreement and tapped his sideslinger pull crew to ease up on their movements as they worked to set the basket. Mounted on the side of the jamb of a hallway door, the sideslinger catapult served as the staple war engine of the outer defenses of Mithral Hall. Its adjustable arm length made it the perfect war engine to fit any situation, and in the east, so close to the great flowing river that the stones continually hummed with the reverberations of its currents, the catapults were front-line and primary. For just beyond the group\u0027s present position in the eastern reaches of the complex, the tunnels dived down into the wilds of the Underdark. Even in times of peace, the eastern sideslingers were often put to use, chasing back umber hulks or displacer beasts, or any of the other dark denizens of those lightless corridors. By his own request, Tred had come down for duty right after the door to Keeper\u0027s Dale had been sealed, for the position oversaw those tunnels that connected Mithral Hall, through the upper Underdark, to Citadel Felbarr, Tred\u0027s home. From that very spot, a location where an ironbound door that could be quickly and tightly sealed, emissaries from Steward Regis had gone out to gain audience with King Emerus Warcrown of Citadel Felbarr, to tell Emerus the tale of Tred and Nikwillig, and his missing caravan. Tred had remained there for many hours, taking double shifts, and staying even when he was not on watch. The only time he\u0027d gone back to the main halls of Clan Battlehammer\u0027s complex had been that very day, for he had been summoned to meet with King Bruenor. He had just returned from that meeting, to find his companions all astir at reports of movement in the east. Tred stood with them anxiously and thought, Is this the front end of yet another attack by Obould\u0027s masses? Some monstrous Underdark creature coming forth in search of a meal? The return of the emissaries, perhaps? Beyond the door, the tunnel sloped down into a roughly circular natural chamber that branched off in several directions. Ready to turn that chamber into a killing ground, the dwarves opposite the sideslinger readied several kegs of highly flammable oil. At the first sign of trouble, the dwarves would lead, rolling the barrels down into the lower room, contents spilling on the floor, then the sideslinger would let fly a wad of burning pitch. Bellan Brawnanvil signaled Tred and the barrel-rollers that the catapult was ready, and all the dwarves hushed, more than one falling to the floor and putting an ear to the stone. They heard a sound below, from one of the tunnels off the circular chamber. A barrel was silently brought into place at the top of the ramp and an eager young dwarf put his shoulder behind it, ready to send it bouncing down. Tred peered anxiously around the door jamb above that barrel, straining his eyes in the darkness. He caught the flicker of torchlight. So did the dwarf behind the barrel, and he gave a little yelp and started to shove. But Tred stopped him before he ever began, waggling a finger at him and fixing him with a scowl. A moment later, all were glad that he did, for they heard, \"Bah, ye great snorter of pig-sweat, ye turned us all about again!\" \"Did not, yer mother\u0027s worst mistake! This ain\u0027t no chamber we been through.\" \"Been through and been out four times, ye dolt!\" \"Ain\u0027t not!\" Tred and the dwarves around him grinned widely. \"Well, if ye been through four times, then ye been through with a lot less racket than ye\u0027re making now, ye fat-bellied bearded bunch o\u0027 archery targets!\" Tred hollered. Below him, the chamber went silent, and the light quickly flickered out. \"Oh, so now ye\u0027re the sneaky things?\" Tred asked. \"Step up and be recognized, be ye Warcrown or Battlehammer!\" \"Warcrown!\" came a shout from below, a voice that sparked some recognition in Tred. \"Battlehammer!\" said another, and the dwarves in the room recognized it as Sindel Muffinhead, one of the emissaries sent out by Steward Regis, a young acolyte, and expert pie baker, who named the now famous Cordio as his older brother. Torches flared to life below and several figures moved into sight, then began stomping up the ramp. As they neared, Tred noted an old friend. \"Jackonray Broadbelt!\" he called. \"Been a halfling\u0027s meal and more since I last seen ye!\" \"Tred, me friend!\" replied Jackonray, leading the way into the room for his seven companions, including Sindel, but not the other emissary. Jackonray wore heavy armor with dark gray metal plates set on thick leather. His helm was bowl-shaped and ridged, and topped a shock of gray hair that reached out wildly from beneath its metal hem. Jackonray\u0027s beard was not so unkempt, though, and was streaked with hair the color of gold and lines the color of silver, braided together to give the dwarf a very distinctive and distinguished appearance. In accord with his surname, his girdle was wide and decorated with sparkling jewels. He rested the elbow of his weapon arm on it as he continued, \"Sorry I am to hear o\u0027 yer brother.\" He patted Tred hard on the shoulder with a hand that seemed as hard as stone. \"Aye, Duggan was a good friend.\" \"And a loyal companion. A tribute to yer family.\" Tred reached up and solemnly squeezed Jackonray\u0027s thick and strong arm. \"Ye come from King Emerus, then, and with good news, I\u0027m thinking,\" Tred remarked a moment later. \"Let\u0027s get ye to King Bruenor.\" \"Aye, straightaways.\" The pair and Sindel moved off at a swift pace, the other Felbarran dwarves falling in line behind them. As they wound through the more populated reaches of Mithral Hall, more than a few Battlehammer dwarves took up the march, as well, so that by the time they crossed through the great Undercity and climbed along the main tunnels leading to Bruenor\u0027s chamber, nearly fifty dwarves formed the procession, many of them chatting amongst themselves, exchanging information about their respective strongholds. Other runners went far ahead to announce them to Bruenor long before they arrived. \"Where\u0027s Nikwillig, then?\" asked Jackonray, rolling along at Tred\u0027s side. \"Still out there in the North,\" Tred explained, and there was no mistaking the sudden graveness to his tone. \"Nikwillig went out to the mountains in the east to send back a signal, and he knew in doing it that he\u0027d not easily get back into Mithral Hall. Felt he - we, owed it to Bruenor, since he done so much to help us avenge our lost kin.\" \"Seems proper,\" said Jackonray. \"But if he\u0027s not in now, he\u0027s likely dead.\" \"Aye, but he died a hero,\" said Tred. \"And no dwarf\u0027s ever asking more than that.\" \"What more than that might ye ask?\" asked Jackonray. \"Here, here,\" added Sindel. When the troupe arrived at Bruenor\u0027s audience chamber door, they found it wide open, with the dwarf king inside on his throne, awaiting their arrival. \"King Bruenor, I give ye Jackonray Broadbelt,\" Tred said with a bow. \"Of the Hornriver Broadbelts, first cousins to King Emerus Warcrown himself. Jackonray here\u0027s King Warcrown\u0027s own nephew, and a favored one at that. Sixth in line for the throne, by last count, behind King Emerus\u0027s five sons.\" \"Sixth or twenty-fifth, depending upon King Warcrown\u0027s disposition,\" Jackonray said with a wink. \"He\u0027s one for keeping us guessing.\" \"Aye, and a smart choice that\u0027s always been,\" said Bruenor. \"Yer ambassadors\u0027re telling me King Emerus that ye\u0027ve come against Obould Many-Arrows,\" Jackonray said. \"One and the same, by all I\u0027m hearing.\" \"Well, King Bruenor, know that Obould\u0027s a smart one, as orcs go. Ye take great care in handling this snortsnout.\" \"He sealed me and me kin inside the hall,\" Bruenor explained. \"Shut the east door by the Surbrin.\" \"Felbarr scouts have seen as much,\" Jackonray said. \"And them giants and orcs\u0027re building defenses all along the river\u0027s western bank.\" \"And they drove me kin in from the western door, in Keeper\u0027s Dale,\" Bruenor admitted. \"I\u0027d not thinked that Clan Battlehammer could be put underground by a bunch o\u0027 stinkin\u0027 orcs, but what a bunch it is. Thousands and thousands.\" \"And led by one that knows how to fight,\" said Jackonray. \"Know in yer heart, King Bruenor, that if Obould\u0027s got ye in here, then Obould\u0027s thinking to come in after ye.\" \"That\u0027ll cost him.\" \"Dearly, I\u0027m sure, good King Bruenor.\" \"They been fighting in the south tunnels a bit already,\" Bruenor reported. \"With smelly trolls and not orcs, but the battling\u0027s not so heavy.\" Jackonray stroked his silver and gold beard. \"Lady Alustriel of Silvery-moon\u0027s been sending out the word of a wide push from the Trollmoors. One that\u0027s threatened all the lands south of here. It\u0027s as big a fight as we thinked we\u0027d ever be seeing, don\u0027t ye doubt. But know that Obould\u0027s not to let it sit, and not to let you sit. By all me experience in fighting that dog, and I\u0027ve had more than ye know, if there\u0027s fighting in the south, then prepare for something bigger from the north, east, or west. Obould\u0027s got you in a hole, but he\u0027s not to let you stay, even if it costs him every orc, goblin, and giant he can find.\" \"Stupid orcs,\" Tred muttered. \"Aye, and that\u0027s just why they\u0027re so dangerous,\" Bruenor said. He looked from the two dwarves to his own advisors, then back at Jackonray directly. \"Well, then, what\u0027s coming from Felbarr?\" \"I appreciate yer bluntness,\" Jackonray said with another low bow. \"And I\u0027m here to tell ye not to doubt us. Felbarr\u0027s behind ye to the last, King Bruenor. All our gold and all our dwarves. Right now we got hundreds working the tunnels under the Surbrin, securing the line all the way from Mithral Hall to Felbarr. We\u0027ll have them open and secure, don\u0027t ye doubt.\" Bruenor nodded his gratitude, but at the same time motioned with his hand that he wanted to hear more. \"We\u0027ll set it as a trade and supply route,\" Jackonray went on. \"King Emerus telled me to tell yerself that we\u0027ll work as agents for Mithral Hall in yer time o\u0027 need, no commission taken.\" That brought a concerned look to Bruenor\u0027s face, and it was a look mirrored on all the Battlehammers in attendance. \"Ye\u0027re to need to get yer goods to market, and so we\u0027ll be yer market,\" Jackonray stated. \"Ye\u0027re sounding like we\u0027re to give Obould all that he\u0027s got and let him keep it,\" Bruenor voiced. For the first time since the meeting commenced, Jackonray seemed a bit less than sure of himself. \"No, we\u0027re not for that, but King Emerus is thinking that it\u0027s to take some time to push the orcs back,\" Jackonray explained. \"And when time\u0027s come to do the pushing?\" \"If it comes to fighting, then we\u0027ll shore up yer ranks, shoulder to shoulder,\" Jackonray insisted. \"Know in yer Delzoun heart, King Bruenor, that Felbarr\u0027s with ye, dwarf to dwarf. When the fighting\u0027s starting, we\u0027ll be with ye. And not just Felbarr, don\u0027t ye doubt, though it\u0027ll take Citadel Adbar longer to mobilize her thousands.\" The show of solidarity touched Bruenor deeply, to be sure, but he didn\u0027t miss the equivocation to Jackonray\u0027s remark. The other leaders of the region had taken note of the orc march, indeed, but there was apparently some discussion going on about what they should, or even could, do about it. \"In the meanwhile, we\u0027ll get those tunnels opened and safe for ye to move yer goods through to Felbarr and out to market,\" Jackonray offered, and Bruenor, who hadn\u0027t even entertained such a thought, who hadn\u0027t even begun to resign himself to that grim possibility, merely nodded. \"That orc was something ... beyond any orc,\" Wulfgar remarked. With a frame closer to seven feet than six, and hardened in the wilderness of the tundra of Icewind Dale, the barbarian was as strong as any man, and so he thought, stronger than any orc. But the brutish creature who had cut Shoudra Stargleam in half had taught Wulfgar better, tossing the barbarian aside with a shrug. \"It was as if I was pushing against a falling mountainside.\" Catti-brie understood his shock and distress. It wasn\u0027t often that Wulfgar, son of Beornegar, had been bested in a test of sheer strength. Even giants had not thrown him aside with such seeming ease. \"They\u0027re saying it was Obould Many-Arrows, himself,\" she replied. \"He and I will meet again,\" Wulfgar vowed, his crystalline blue eyes sparkling at the thought. Catti-brie limped up beside him and gently brushed his long blond hair from the side of his face, forcing him to turn and look at her directly. \"You don\u0027t be doing anything foolhardy,\" she said softly. \"We\u0027ll get Obould, don\u0027t you doubt, but we\u0027ll get him in the proper order of business. We\u0027ll get him as we\u0027ll get all of them, and there\u0027s no room for personal vengeance here. Bigger stakes than pride.\" Wulfgar snickered and smiled. \"True enough,\" he replied, \"and yet, you\u0027re not believing the words any more than you\u0027re expecting me to believe them. You want that ugly one in your bow-sight again, as much as I want him now that I understand what to expect from him.\" Catti-brie tried hard not to smile back at the barbarian, but she knew that her rich blue eyes were shining as brightly as Wulfgar\u0027s. \"Oh, I\u0027m wanting him,\" she admitted. \"But not so much with me bow.\" She led his gaze with her own down to the fabulous sword sheathed on her left hip. Khazid\u0027hea, \"Cutter,\" as it was called, a name that surely fit. Catti-brie had put that blade through solid stone. Could any armor, even the wondrous suit encasing Obould Many-Arrows, turn its keen edge? Both of them seemed to realize then that they were but inches apart, close enough to feel the warmth of each other\u0027s breath. Catti-brie broke the tension first, reaching up and playfully tousling Wulfgar\u0027s wild shock of hair, then hopping up to her tip-toes and giving him a kiss on the cheek - the kiss of a friend, and nothing more. In its own way, that was a defining moment for her. Wulfgar\u0027s reciprocating grin, though, seemed a bit less than certain. \"So we\u0027re thinking we should be getting scouts out through the chimneys,\" came a voice from behind Catti-brie, and she turned around to see her adoptive father Bruenor entering the room, Regis in tow. \"We got to know what our enemies are thinking if we\u0027re to counter them properly.\" \"They\u0027re orcs,\" Wulfgar said. \"Betting would say that they\u0027re not thinking much.\" His attempt at humor would have been more successful if that last maneuver of the orc army had not been so fresh in all their minds, the deceptive swing behind the mountain spurs to the west that brought the bulk of their force in behind Banak\u0027s charges, nearly spelling disaster for the dwarves. \"We can\u0027t be knowing a thing about them orcs unless we\u0027re seeing it ourselfs,\" Bruenor remarked. \"I\u0027m not for underestimating this one again.\" Regis shifted uncomfortably. \"I\u0027m thinking that we scored a bigger victory than we realized,\" Catti-brie was quick to remark. \"We won the day out there, though our losses surely hurt.\" \"Seems to me like we\u0027re the ones in our hole,\" Bruenor replied. \"But it\u0027s seeming to me that we could not\u0027ve done better,\" reasoned the woman, and she looked directly at the halfling, her expression showing her approval. \"If we\u0027d\u0027ve come right in, then we\u0027d not now know what\u0027s come against us. What straights might we soon find ourselves in if you had acted otherwise, if we had run from the ridge straightaway? Would we truly understand the size and ferocity of the force that\u0027s arrayed against us? Would we have delivered so powerful a blow against our enemy? They\u0027ve come to fight us, and so we\u0027ll be fighting, don\u0027t you doubt, and better that we understand what we\u0027re fighting, and better that we\u0027ve laid so many low already. Thanks to Nanfoodle and the others, we\u0027ve killed them as overwhelmingly as we could ever have hoped thus far, even if all the fighting had been in our own defended tunnels.\" \"Ye got the right way o\u0027 seeing things, girl,\" Bruenor agreed after a pause to digest the reasoning. \"If they\u0027re thinking to come in against us, at least now we\u0027re knowing what they got to throw our way.\" \"So hold our heads high and hold our weapons all the tighter,\" Wulfgar chimed in. \"Oo oi!\" said Regis, and everyone looked at him curiously. \"What\u0027s that meaning, anyway?\" asked Catti-brie. Regis shrugged. \"Just sounded right,\" he explained, and no one disagreed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-two-swords-hunter-s-blades-3/page-5.html","bookId":2142,"book":{"id":2142,"title":"The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3)","description":"Storyline: The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3) In The Two Swords, Obould\u0027s horde has pressed the Companions to the very gates of Mithral Hall, where Bruenor and his clan launch a desperate, last-ditch effort to push the orcs back.
