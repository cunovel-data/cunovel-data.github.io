Kaer\u0027lic\u0027s spell had broken most of the bones in Tsinka\u0027s face, the shaman knew, and Tsinka was glad indeed when she had awakened to find the two drow long gone. Everyone was long gone, it seemed, for the orcs had run away from that terrible earthquake.\n For many minutes, Tsinka Shinriil sat and stared at the broken rock across the way, plumes of dust still hanging in the air from the weight of the avalanche. What had Kaer\u0027lic done? Why had Lady Lolth gone against He-Who-Was-Gruumsh? It made no sense to the poor, broken shaman.\n Moving against hope, Tsinka pulled herself to her feet and staggered toward the area of disaster. She followed the same path Obould had taken on his approach to the renegade drow. She could still see some of her god\u0027s footprints in the snow and dirt before her. Half-blinded by drying blood and streams of tears, Tsinka stumbled along, falling more than once, crying out to her god.\n \"How did you let this happen?\"\n She nearly tripped over a form half-buried in the snow and rubble, then recoiled and kicked out at it when she saw it was that ugly little dwarf. He grunted, so she kicked him again and moved along. She pulled herself up on the remains of the flat rock that had served as the battleground. The earthquake had split it in half, and the far half, where both Obould and Drizzt had been standing, had fallen away.\n Tsinka wiped her arm across her face and forced herself to stagger forward. She fell to her knees and peered into the area of ruin, into the dust.\n And there, only a dozen feet below her, she saw the form of a battered but very much alive dark elf.\n \"You!\" she howled, and she spat at him.\n Drizzt looked up at her. Filthy and bruised, bloody on one side and holding one arm in close, the drow had not escaped unharmed. But he had escaped, landing on a small ledge, perched on the very edge of oblivion.\n \"Where will you run now?\" Tsinka shouted at him.\n She glanced all around then scrambled to the side, returning a moment later with a rock in each hand. She pegged one down at him and missed, then took more careful aim with the second and whipped it off his upraised, blocking arm.\n \"Your flying horse is nowhere about, drow!\" she shouted, and she hopped around in search of more ammo.\n Again she pelted Drizzt with rocks, and there was nothing he could do but lift his arm to block and accept the stinging hits. He had no room to maneuver, and try as he may, he could not find any handholds that would propel him back up to the flat rock.\n Every time she threw a stone, Tsinka scanned the skies. The pegasus wouldn\u0027t catch her by surprise, she vowed. The drow had played a role in destroying He-Who-Was-Gruumsh, and so the drow would have to die.\n He was out of options. There was nothing Drizzt could do against the assault. He still had his scimitars and Ivan\u0027s crossbow, but the remaining darts he\u0027d left on Sunrise, who was nowhere to be seen. Sitting on the tiny ledge, Drizzt had hoped that the pegasus would find him before the inevitable return of his enemies.\n No such luck, and so all he could do was deflect the stinging stones with his upraised arms.\n The orc shaman disappeared for a longer period of time, then, and Drizzt desperately looked around. No pegasus came into view - and in his rational thoughts, he knew that it would be some time before Sunrise would come back to the unstable, devastated area.\n \"At least Obould is gone,\" he whispered, and he glanced out over the ledge, where the shifting stones continued to rumble. \"Bruenor will win the day.\"\n Whatever hope that notion inspired disappeared in the realization of his mortality, as Drizzt looked back up to see the orc hoist a huge rock over her head in both hands. He glanced to the sides quickly, looking for some place he might leap.\n But there was nothing.\n The orc snarled at him and moved to throw.\n And she lurched and went flying, both her and the rock tumbling out too far, past the surprised drow and down the broken mountainside. On the rock above, hanging over the edge, loomed a hairy and battered face.\n \"Well met, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden,\" said Fender. \"Think ye might be taking me home?\"\n \"We will go to Gerti and determine what she is about,\" said Kaer\u0027lic.\n \"The dwarf is gone and Tsinka is likely plotting our demise,\" Tos\u0027un replied.\n \"If the pig-faced shaman even lives,\" Kaer\u0027lic retorted. \"I hope she does, that I might make her death even more unpleasant. Too much have I seen of these wretched and foul-smelling orcs. Too many tendays have we spent in their filthy company, listening to their foolish gibbering, and pretending that anything they might have to say would be of the least bit of interest to us. Gruumsh take Obould, and Lady Lolth take Drizzt, and may they both be tortured until eternity\u0027s end!\"\n So caught up was she in her ranting, that Kaer\u0027lic didn\u0027t even notice Tos\u0027un\u0027s eyes go so wide that they seemed as if they might just roll out of his face. So full of spit and anger was she that it took her some time to even realize that Tos\u0027un wasn\u0027t looking at her, but rather past her.\n Kaer\u0027lic froze in place.\n Tos\u0027un squealed, turned, and ran away.\n Kaer\u0027lic realized she should just follow, without question, but before her mind could command her feet to run, a powerful hand grabbed her by the back of her hair and jerked her head back so violently and forcefully that she felt as if her entire body had been suddenly compacted.\n \"Do you recognize the foul smell?\" Obould Many-Arrows whispered into her ear. He tugged harder with that one hand pulling her down and back, but not letting her fall. \"Does my gibbering offend you now?\"\n Kaer\u0027lic could hardly move, so forceful was that grasp. She saw Obould\u0027s greatsword sticking past her, off to the side. She felt his breath, hot against her neck, and stinking as only an orc\u0027s breath could. She had to tug back and stretch her jaw muscles so that they could even move against that incredible pull, and she tried futilely to form some words, any words.\n \"Casting a spell, witch?\" Obould asked her. \"Sorry, but that I cannot allow.\"\n His face came forward suddenly, his jaw clamping on Kaer\u0027lic\u0027s exposed throat. She reached up and grabbed at him and squirmed and thrashed desperately, with all her might.\n Obould tore his face away, taking her throat with it. He yanked Kaer\u0027lic back and put his bloody and battered face right before her, then spat her own flesh into her face.\n \"I am imbued with the blessing of Gruumsh,\" he said. \"Did you truly believe that you could kill me?\"\n Kaer\u0027lic gasped, her arms flailing wildly and uncontrollably, blood pouring from her torn throat, and bubbling from the air escaping her lungs.\n Obould threw her to the ground and let her die slowly.\n He scanned the region, and noted some movement on a distant ridge. It wasn\u0027t Tsinka, he knew, for he had seen her broken body on the stones as he climbed back up the mountainside.\n He\u0027d need to find a new shaman, a new consort who treated him as a god. He\u0027d need to move quickly to reconsolidate his power, to cut short the rumors of his demise. The orcs would be fast to flee, he knew, and only he, imbued with the power of Gruumsh, could stop the retreat.\n \"Dark Arrows,\" he said with determination. \"My home.\"\n The weather broke, leaving the air fresh and clean, and with a warm south wind blowing. Bruenor and his friends would not stay inside, spending their days along the northern mountain spur, staring off into the north.\n Pikel Bouldershoulder\u0027s bird scouts were the first to report a pair of winged horses, making all speed for Mithral Hall, and so it was not a surprise, but such a tremendous relief nonetheless, when the distinctive forms finally came into view.\n Bruenor and Wulfgar moved a couple of paces out in front of the others, Regis, the Bouldershoulders, Cordio, Stumpet, and Pwent behind them, and Catti-brie in back, leaning heavily on a wooden cane and on the side of the tower.\n Sunset set down on the stone before the dwarf king, Innovindil lifted her leg over before her and dropping quickly, turning as she went to support poor Fender through the move. Without that support, the dwarf would surely have tumbled off.\n Wulfgar stepped forward and gently hoisted the dwarf from the pegasus, then handed him to Cordio and Stumpet, who hustled him away.\n \"Obould is gone,\" Innovindil reported. \"The orcs will not hold, and all the northland will be free again.\"\n As she finished, Sunrise landed on the stone.\n \"A sight for an old dwarf\u0027s sore eyes,\" Bruenor said.\n Drizzt slipped down to the ground. He glanced at Bruenor, but his stare remained straight ahead, cutting through the ranks, which parted as surely as if he had shouldered his way through, leaving the line of sight open between the drow and Catti-brie.\n \"Welcome home,\" Regis said.\n \"We never doubted your return,\" offered Wulfgar.\n Drizzt nodded at each, though he never stopped staring ahead. He patted Bruenor as he walked past. He tousled Regis\u0027s hair and he grabbed and squeezed Wulfgar\u0027s strong forearm.\n But he never stopped moving and never stopped staring.\n He hit Catti-brie with a great hug, pressing up against her, kissing her and crushing her, lifting her right from the ground.\n And he kept walking, carrying her along.\n \"That is what it is to be an elf, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden,\" Innovindil whispered as the two moved to, and through, Mithral Hall\u0027s new eastern door.\n \"Well I\u0027ll be a bearded gnome,\" said Bruenor.\n \"Hee hee hee,\" said Pikel, and Regis giggled, embarrassed.\n They all were fairly amused, it seemed, but Bruenor\u0027s mirth disappeared when he glanced across at Wulfgar.\n The big man stared at the path Drizzt and Catti-brie had taken, and there was a wince of profound pain to be found behind his mask of stoicism. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-two-swords-hunter-s-blades-3/page-32.html","bookId":2142,"book":{"id":2142,"title":"The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3) \n In The Two Swords, Obould\u0027s horde has pressed the Companions to the very gates of Mithral Hall, where Bruenor and his clan launch a desperate, last-ditch effort to push the orcs back.
