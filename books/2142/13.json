{"id":95795,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"You cannot even think of continuing back toward Nesme,\" Rannek scolded after he had taken Galen Firth off to the side of the main encampment.\\n\\n They had run for many hours after the heroic intervention of General Dagna and his dwarves, going back to the foothills in the north near where the dwarves had found the tunnels that would take them to Mithral Hall.\\n\\n \"Would you make the sacrifice of those fifty dwarves irrelevant for the sake of your pride?\" Rannek pressed.\\n\\n \"You are one to be speaking of pride,\" Galen Firth replied, and his adversary did back down at that.\\n\\n But only for a moment, then Rannek squared his shoulders and puffed out his broad chest. \"I will never forget my error, Galen Firth,\" he admitted. \"But I will not complicate that error now by throwing our entire force into the jaws of the trolls and bog blokes.\"\\n\\n \"They were routed!\" Galen yelled, and both he and Rannek glanced back to the main group to note several curious expressions coming back at them. \"They were routed,\" he said again, more quietly. \"Between the dwarves\u0027 valiant stand and Alustriel\u0027s firestorm, the enemy forces were sliced apart. Did they even offer any pursuit? No? Then is it not also possible that the monsters have gone home to their dung-filled moor? Are you so ready to run away?\"\\n\\n \"And are you truly stupid enough to walk back into them? Care you not for those who cannot fight? Should our children die on your gamble, Galen Firth?\"\\n\\n \"We do not even know where the caves are,\" Galen argued. \"We cannot simply wander the countryside blindly and hope we find the right hole in the ground.\"\\n\\n \"Then let us march to Silverymoon,\" offered Rannek.\\n\\n \"Silverymoon will march to us,\" Galen insisted. \"Did you not see Alustriel?\\n\\n Rannek chewed his lip and it took all of his control not to just spit on the man. \"Are you that much the fool?\" he asked. \"The ungrateful fool?\"\\n\\n \"I am not the fool who put us out here, far from our homes,\" Galen answered without hesitation, and in the same calm tone that Rannek had just used on him. \"That man stands before me now, errantly thinking he has the credibility to question me.\"\\n\\n Rannek didn\u0027t blink and didn\u0027t back down, but in truth, he knew that he had no practical answer to that. He was not in command. The beleaguered folk of Nesme would not listen to him over the assurances and orders of the proven Galen Firth.\\n\\n He stared at the man a while longer, then just shook his head and turned away. He didn\u0027t allow his grimace to stop the smooth flow of his departure when he heard Galen Firth\u0027s derisive snort behind him.\\n\\n The next dawn made the argument to Galen Firth that Rannek had been unable to make, for the scouts from the refugee band returned with news that a host of trolls was fast closing from the south.\\n\\n Watching Galen Firth as he heard that grim report, Rannek almost expected the man to order the warriors to close ranks and launch an attack, but even the stern and stubborn Galen was not that foolhardy.\\n\\n \"Gather up and prepare to march, and quickly,\" he called to those around him. He turned to the scouts. \"Some of you monitor the approach of our enemies. Others take swift flight to the northeast. Find our scouts who are searching for the tunnels to Mithral Hall and secure our escape route.\"\\n\\n As he finished, the man turned a glare over Rannek, who nodded in silent approval. Galen Firth\u0027s face grew very tight at that, as if he took the expression as a smarmy insult.\\n\\n \"We will lure our enemies into a long run, and circumvent them so that we might reclaim our home,\" Galen stubbornly told his soldiers, and Rannek\u0027s jaw dropped open.\\n\\n Having grown adept at running, the Nesme band was on the move in minutes, and in proper formation so that the weakest were well supported near the center of the march. Few said anything. They knew that trolls were in close pursuit, and that that day could mark the end of all their lives.\\n\\n They came to higher and more broken ground by mid-morning, and from an open vantage point, Galen, Rannek, and some others got their first look at the pursuing force. It seemed to be trolls exclusively, for nowhere among the approaching mob did they see the treelike appendages of bog blokes. Still, there were more than a few trolls down there, including several very large specimens and some of those sporting more than one head.\\n\\n Rannek knew that they had done right in retreating, as he had suggested many hours before. Any satisfaction he took from that was lost, though, in his fears that they would not be able to outrun that monstrous force.\\n\\n \"Keep them moving as fast as possible,\" Galen Firth ordered, his voice grave and full of similar fears, Rannek knew, whether Galen would admit them or not - even to himself. \"Have we found those tunnels yet?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve found some tunnels,\" one of the other men explained. \"We do not know how deep they run.\"\\n\\n Galen Firth pinched his lip between his thumb and index finger.\\n\\n \"And if we run in before we know for certain, and run into a dead end....\" the man went on.\\n\\n \"Hurry, then,\" Galen ordered. \"Stretch lines of scouts into the tunnel. We seek one that will loop around and bring us out behind our pursuing enemies. We will have to either run by or run in - there will be no time to dally!\"\\n\\n The man nodded and rushed away.\\n\\n Galen turned to regard Rannek.\\n\\n \"And so you believe that you were right,\" he said.\\n\\n \"For what that\u0027s worth,\" Rannek replied. \"It does not matter.\" He looked back at the pursuing force, drawing Galen\u0027s eyes with his own. \"Never could we have anticipated such dogged pursuit from an enemy as chaotic and undisciplined as trolls! In all my years...\"\\n\\n \"Your years are not all that long,\" Galen reminded him. \"Thus were you fooled that night you headed the watch.\"\\n\\n \"As you were fooled now into thinking the pursuit would not come,\" Rannek shot back, but the words sounded feeble even to him, and certainly Galen\u0027s smug expression did little to give him any thought that he had stung the man.\\n\\n \"I welcome their pursuit,\" Galen said. \"If I\u0027m surprised, it is pleasantly so. We run them off, farther from Nesme. When we get behind our walls once more, we will find the time we need to fortify our defenses.\"\\n\\n \"Unless there are more trolls waiting for us there.\"\\n\\n \"Your failure has led you to a place where you overestimate our enemy, Rannek. They are trolls. Stupid and vicious, and little more. They have shown perseverance beyond expectation, but it will not hold.\"\\n\\n Galen gave a snort and started away, but Rannek grabbed him by the arm. The Rider turned on him angrily.\\n\\n \"You would gamble the lives of all these people on that proposition?\" Rannek asked.\\n\\n \"Our entire existence in Nesme has been a gamble - for centuries,\" Galen replied. \"It is what we do. It is the way we live.\"\\n\\n \"Or the way we die?\"\\n\\n \"So be it.\"\\n\\n Galen yanked himself free of Rannek\u0027s grasp. He stared at the man a while longer, then turned around and started shouting orders to those around him. He was cut short, though, almost immediately, for somewhere among the lines of refugees, a man shouted, \"The Axe! The Axe of Mirabar is come!\"\\n\\n \"All praise Mirabar!\" another shouted, and the cheer was taken up across the gathering.\\n\\n Rannek and Galen Firth charged through the throng, crossing the crowd to get a view of the source of the commotion.\\n\\n Dwarves, dozens and dozens of dwarves, marched toward them, many of them bearing the black axe of Mirabar on their shields. They moved in tight and disciplined formation, their ranks holding steady as they crossed the broken ground in their determined advance.\\n\\n \"Not of Mirabar,\" one scout explained to Galen, huffing and puffing with every word, for he had run all the way back to precede the newcomers. \"More of Clan Battlehammer, they claim to be.\"\\n\\n \"They wear the emblem of Mirabar\u0027s famed Axe,\" said Galen.\\n\\n \"And so they once were,\" the scout explained. He stopped and stepped aside, watching with the others as the dwarves closed.\\n\\n A pair of battle-worn dwarves approached, one with a thick black beard and the other ancient and one of the ugliest dwarves either man had ever seen. He was shorter and wider than his companion, with half his black beard torn away and one eye missing. His ruddy, weathered face had seen the birth and death of centuries, the humans easily surmised. The pair approached Galen\u0027s position, guided by yet another of the scouts the Nesmians had sent forth. They walked up before the man and the younger dwarf dropped the head of his heavy warhammer on the stone before him, then leaned on it heavily.\\n\\n \"Torgar Delzoun Hammerstriker of Clan Battlehammer at yer service,\" he said. \"And me friend Shingles.\"\\n\\n \"You wear the symbol of Mirabar, good Torgar,\" said Galen. \"And glad we are to have your service.\"\\n\\n \"We were of Mirabar,\" Shingles offered. \"We left to serve a king of more generous heart. And so ye see the end of that, for here we are, to support ye and support General Dagna, who came out here with ye.\"\\n\\n Several of the nearby humans looked to each other with concern, expressions that were not lost on the dwarves.\\n\\n \"I will tell you of Dagna\u0027s fall when the time permits a tale that would do him justice,\" Galen Firth said, straightening his shoulders. \"For now, our enemies close fast from behind. Trolls - many trolls.\"\\n\\n Most of the dwarves mumbled to each other about \"Dagna\u0027s fall,\" but Torgar and Shingles kept their expressions stoic.\\n\\n \"Then let\u0027s get to the tunnels,\" Torgar decided. \"Me and me boys\u0027ll do better against the gangly brutes when they\u0027re bending low so as not to bump their ugly heads on the ceiling.\"\\n\\n \"We fight them there and push them back,\" Galen agreed. \"Perhaps we can break them and gain a path through their lines.\"\\n\\n \"Through?\" asked Torgar. \"Mithral Hall\u0027s at the other end of them tunnels, and that\u0027s where we\u0027re for.\"\\n\\n \"We have word that Silverymoon will soon join in the fight,\" Galen explained, and no one around him dared point out that he was stretching the truth quite a bit. \"Now is the day of our victory, when Nesme will be restored and the region secured!\"\\n\\n The dwarves both looked at him curiously for a moment, then looked to each other and just shrugged.\\n\\n \"Not to matter,\" Shingles said to Torgar. \"Either choice we\u0027re to make, we\u0027re to make it from the tunnels.\"\\n\\n \"So to the tunnels we go,\" the other dwarf agreed.\\n\\n \"Side run\u0027s open!\" came a relayed shout along the dwarven line.\\n\\n \"Torch \u0027em!\" Shingles cried.\\n\\n Twenty dwarves from the second rank rushed forward, flaming torches in hand, and as one they threw the fiery brands over Shingles and the first line of fighters, who were engaged heavily with the leading lines of troll pursuit.\\n\\n They had run down a long tunnel that spread into a wider chamber, and had made their stand at the funnel-like opening, allowing a score of dwarves to stand abreast, where only a few trolls could come through to battle them. The torchbearers aimed their flaming missiles at the narrower tunnel entrance, where several pieces of seasoned kindling, soaked with lamp oil, had been strategically placed.\\n\\n The fires roared to life.\\n\\n Trolls weren\u0027t afraid of much, but fire, which defeated their incredible regenerative powers, ranked foremost among that short list.\\n\\n The torches loosened the pursuit considerably, and Shingles put his line, and those who had come behind, into a sudden, devastating charge, driving back those few trolls that had been caught on the near side of the conflagration. A couple were forced back into the flames, while others were chopped down and stabbed where they stood.\\n\\n The dwarves broke and ran in perfect formation. The side passage had been declared open, and the refugees were already well on their way.\\n\\n Yet again, for the third time that afternoon, Torgar\u0027s boys had fended off the stubborn troll pursuit.\\n\\n The monsters would come on again, though, they all knew, and so those dwarves leading the line of retreat were busy inspecting every intersection and every chamber to see if they could find a suitable location for their next inevitable stand.\\n\\n From the rear defensive ranks of the human contingent, Rannek watched it all with admiration and gratitude. He knew that Galen Firth was stewing about it all, for they had already eschewed a route that likely would have put them back outside ahead of the trolls, possibly with open ground to Nesme.\\n\\n But it was Torgar, not Galen, who was in control. Rannek and all the folk of Nesme understood that much. For after hearing the details of Dagna\u0027s fall, Torgar had explained in no uncertain terms that the humans could run away from the dwarven escort if they so chose, but they would do so at their own risk.\\n\\n \"All glory to Dagna and Mithral Hall,\" Torgar had said to Galen and the others after hearing the sad story. \"He goes to join his son in the Halls of Moradin, where a place of honor awaits.\"\\n\\n \"He tried to help us reclaim our home,\" Galen put in, and those words had drawn a look from Torgar that dwarves often reserved for orcs alone.\\n\\n \"He saved yer foolish arse,\" Torgar retorted. \"And if ye\u0027re choosing to try to make that run again, then \u0027twas his mistake. But know ye this, Galen Firth o\u0027 Nesme, Torgar and his boys ain\u0027t about to make that same mistake. Any ground we\u0027re holding, we\u0027re holding with tunnels to Mithral Hall at our back, don\u0027t ye doubt.\"\\n\\n And that had been the end of it, and even overly proud Galen hadn\u0027t argued beyond that, and hadn\u0027t said a word of rebuttal to the other Nesmian warriors, either. Thus, Torgar had taken complete control, and had led them on their desperate chase. They ran until pursuit forced a stand then they shaped every encounter to be a quick-hitting deflection rather than a head on battle.\\n\\n Rannek was glad of that. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-two-swords-hunter-s-blades-3/page-13.html","bookId":2142,"book":{"id":2142,"title":"The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3)","description":"Storyline: The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3) \\n In The Two Swords, Obould\u0027s horde has pressed the Companions to the very gates of Mithral Hall, where Bruenor and his clan launch a desperate, last-ditch effort to push the orcs back.
