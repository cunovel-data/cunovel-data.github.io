{"id":95806,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"The storm had greatly abated, but the day seemed all the darker to Innovindil as she sat on Sunset staring back at the cave entrance to Shining White. From what she could tell the giants had pursued her as far as the inner door, and the sentry out in the corridor was still contentedly snoring when she and Sunset had galloped past.\n The elf knew that she should be on her way and should not linger out there. She knew that giants could be creeping out of secret passageways onto ledges along the mountain wall, perhaps very near to her and up above. She feared that if she glanced right or left at any time, she might see a boulder soaring down at her.\n But Innovindil didn\u0027t look to the sides, and did not prompt Sunset to move off at all. She just sat and stared, hoping against all logic that Drizzt Do\u0027Urden would soon come running out of that cavern.\n She chewed her lip as the minutes passed. She knew it could not be so. She had seen him go into the rushing river, swept away below a sheet of ice through which he could not escape. The river didn\u0027t flow out aboveground anywhere in the area, from what she could see and hear, so there was nothing she could do.\n Nothing at all.\n Drizzt was lost to her.\n \"Watch over him, Tarathiel,\" the elf whispered into the wind. \"Greet him in fair Arvandor, for his heart was more for the Seldarine than ever for his dark demon queen.\" Innovindil nodded as she spoke those words, believing them in her heart. Despite the black hue of his skin, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden was no drow, she knew, and had not lived his life as one. Perhaps he was not an elf in manner and thought, either, though Innovindil believed that she could have led him in that direction. But her gods would not reject him, she was certain, and if they did, then what use might she have for them?\n \"Farewell my friend,\" she said. \"I will not forget your sacrifice, nor that you entered that lair for the sake of Sunrise, and for no gain of your own.\"\n She straightened and started to twist, moving to tug the reins to the right so she could be on her way, but again she paused. She had to get back to the Moonwood - she should have done that all along, even before Tarathiel had fallen to Obould\u0027s mighty sword. If she could rally her people, perhaps they could get back to Shining White and properly rescue Sunrise.\n Yes, that was the course before her, the only course, and the sooner Innovindil began that journey, the better off they would all be.\n Still, a long, long time passed before Innovindil found the strength to turn Sunset aside and take that first step away.\n He scrambled and clawed, kicked wildly, and flailed his arms as he tried desperately to keep his face in the narrow pocket of air between the ice and the cold, cold water. Instinct alone kept Drizzt moving as the current rushed him along, for if he paused to consider the pain and the futility, he likely would have simply surrendered.\n It didn\u0027t really seem to matter, anyway, for his movements gradually slowed as the icy cold radiated into his limbs, dulling his muscles and weakening his push. With every passing foot and every passing second, Drizzt slowed and lowered, and he found himself gasping water almost constantly.\n He slammed into something hard, and the current drove him atop it so that he was granted a reprieve for a few moments, at least. Holding his perch on the rock, the drow could keep his mouth in an air pocket. He tried to punch up and break through the ice, but his hand slammed against an unyielding barrier. He thought of his scimitars and reached down with one hand to draw out Twinkle. Surely that blade could cut through -\n But his numb fingers couldn\u0027t grasp the hilt tightly enough and as soon as he pulled the scimitar free of its sheath, the current took it from his grasp. And as he lurched instinctively for the drifting and falling blade, Drizzt was swept away once more, turning as he went so that his head dipped far under the icy water.\n He fought and he scrambled, but it was all for naught, he knew. The cold was taking him, permeating his bones and inviting him to a place of a deeper darkness than Drizzt had ever known. He wasn\u0027t seeing anything anymore in the black swirl of water, and even if there had been light, Drizzt would not have seen, for his eyes were closed, his thoughts turning inward, his limbs and sensibilities dying.\n Distantly, the drow felt himself jostled about as the underground river turned and dipped. He crashed though a rocky area, but hardly felt anything as he bounced from one stone to the next.\n Then the river dropped again, more steeply, as if plunging over a waterfall. Drizzt fell hard and landed harder and felt as if he had wedged up against the ice, his neck bent at an awkward angle. The cold sting knifed at his cheek and pressed inward.\n Innovindil moved east from Shining White, keeping the higher mountains on her left and staying within the shadow of those peaks. For she knew she would need them to shelter her from the icy wind when night fell, and to shield the light of the campfire she would have to make.\n She didn\u0027t dare bid Sunset to take to the air, for the gusts of wind could bring catastrophe. It occurred to her that perhaps she should turn south, running to the better weather and to the dwarves of Clan Battlehammer. Would they help her? Would they march beside her all the way to Shining White to rescue a pegasus?\n Probably not, Innovindil knew. But she understood, though it surely pained her to admit it, that she would not likely get back to Shining White before the spring thaw.\n She could only hope that Sunrise would last that long.\n Drizzt\u0027s misperception surprised him when he realized he was not pressed up against the underside of the ice sheet, but was, rather, lying atop it. With a groan that came right from his aching bones, the drow opened his eyes and propped himself up on his elbows. He heard the rush of the waterfall behind him and glanced back that way.\n The river had thrown him free when he\u0027d come over that drop, and he had gone out far enough, just barely, to land upon the ice sheet where it resumed beyond the thrashing water.\n The drow coughed out some water, his lungs cold and aching. He rolled over and sat on the ice, but spread right back out again when he heard it crackling beneath him. Slowly and gingerly, he crept toward the stone wall at the side of the river, and there he found a jag where he could sit and consider his predicament.\n He really hadn\u0027t gone that far in his watery journey, he realized - probably not more than fifty feet or so from where he\u0027d fallen through, not counting the two large steps downward.\n Drizzt snapped his hands to his belt to feel Icingdeath, but not Twinkle, and he grimaced as he recalled losing the scimitar. He glanced back up at the waterfall wistfully, wondering how in the world he might retrieve the blade.\n Then he realized almost immediately that it didn\u0027t really matter. He was soaking wet and the cold was going to kill him before any giants ever could. With that thought in mind, the drow forced himself up on unsteady feet and began inching along the wall, keeping as much of his weight as possible against the stone, and stepping from rock to rock wherever he found the opportunity. He traveled only a few hundred feet, the sound of the waterfall still echoing behind him, when he noted a side passage across the way, fronted by a landing that included a rack of huge fishing poles.\n He didn\u0027t really want to move back into Shining White, but he saw no choice. He lay down on his belly on the ice, maneuvering himself so that he was clear of all the rocks poking up through it. Then he pushed off, sliding out across the frozen river. He scraped and crawled and managed to get across then he went up to the landing and beyond, moving along an upward-sloping tunnel.\n A short while later, he went back on his guard, for the tunnels became wider and more worked, with ornate columns supporting their ceilings, many of which were frescoed with various designs and artwork. At one point, he ducked back just in time as a pair of giants ambled across an intersection not far ahead.\n He waited for them to clear the way, and ...\n What? he wondered. Where was he to go?\n The giants had crossed left to right, so Drizzt went to the left, moving as swiftly as his still numb and sorely aching legs would allow, knowing that he needed to get to a fire soon. He fought to keep his teeth from chattering, and his eyelids felt so very heavy.\n A series of turns and corridors had him moving into the more populated reaches of the complex, but if the giants were at all bothered by the continuing cold, they certainly didn\u0027t show it, for Drizzt saw no sign of any fires anywhere. He kept going - what choice did he have? - though he knew not where, and knew not why.\n A cry from behind alerted him that he had been seen, and the chase was on once more.\n Drizzt darted around a corner, sprinted some thirty feet, then ducked fast around another turn. He ran on, down a corridor lined with statues, and one that he recognized! On the floor lay a broken statue, along with the drow\u0027s own traveling cloak. He scooped it as he passed, wrapped it tight around him, and sprinted on as more and more giants took up the chase. He had his bearings, and he looked to make every turn one that would take him closer to the exit.\n But every turn was blocked to him, as giants paralleled him along tunnels running closer to the exit. He found every route of escape purposefully blocked. He was being herded. Drizzt couldn\u0027t stop, though, unless he planned to fight, for a pair of giants chased him every stride, closing whenever he slowed. He had to turn left instead of right, and so he did, cutting a tight angle around the next corner and running on for all his life. He turned the next left, thinking that perhaps he could double back on the pair chasing him.\n That way, too, was blocked.\n Drizzt turned right and rushed through some open doors. He crossed a large chamber, and the two giants within howled and joined in the chase. Through another set of doors, he came to the end of the hallway, though it turned both left and right. Thinking one way as good as the other, the drow banked left and ran on - right into another large room, one sporting a huge round table where a group of frost giants sat and played, rolling bones for piles of silver coins.\n The table went over, coins and bones flying everywhere, as the behemoths jumped up to leap after the drow.\n \"Not good,\" Drizzt whispered through his blue lips and chattering teeth.\n The next door in line was closed, and the drow hardly slowed, leaping hard against it, shouldering it in. He stumbled and squinted, for he had come into the brightest-lit room in the complex. He tried to reorient himself quickly, to put his feet under him and continue on his way.\n Whichever way that might be.\n For he had come into a large oval chamber, decorated with statues and tapestries. Heads of various monsters - umber hulks, displacer beasts, and even a small dragon among them - lined the walls as trophies. Drizzt knew he wasn\u0027t alone, but it wasn\u0027t until he noted the dais at the far end of the room that he truly appreciated his predicament. For there sat a giantess of extraordinary beauty, decorated with fabulous clothing and many bracelets, necklaces and rings of great value, and wearing a white gown of fabulous texture and fabric. She leaned back in her seat and crossed her bare and shapely legs.\n \"I do so love it when the prey delivers itself,\" she said in the common tongue, her command of it as perfect as Drizzt\u0027s own.\n The drow heard the doors bang closed behind him, and one of the pursuing giants graced him with an announcement. \"Here is the drow you wanted, Dame Orelsdottr,\" the giant said. \"Drizzt Do\u0027Urden is his name, I believe.\"\n Drizzt shook his head and brought a hand up to rub his freezing face. He reached low with the other one, pulling forth Icingdeath - and as he did, he heard giant sentries to either side of him bristle and draw weapons. He looked left and right, noting a line of spears and swords all pointing his way.\n With a shrug, the drow dropped his scimitar to the floor, put his foot atop it and slid it out toward Gerti.\n \"Not even a fight from the famed Drizzt Do\u0027Urden?\" the giantess asked.\n Drizzt didn\u0027t answer.\n \"I would have expected more of you,\" Gerti went on. \"To surrender before dazzling us with your blade work? Or do you believe that you spare your life by giving yourself up to me? Indeed you are a fool if you do, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden. Gather your scimitar if you will. Take up arms and at least try to fight before my soldiers crush the life out of you.\"\n Drizzt eyed her hatefully, and thought to do as she asked. Before he could begin to calculate his chances of getting the blade and quick-stepping ahead to at least score a hit or two upon Gerti\u0027s pretty face, however, a low and feral growl from the side of the giantess caught his, and her attention.\n Gerti turned and Drizzt leveled his gaze, and every giant in the chamber followed suit, to see Guenhwyvar perched on a ledge barely fifteen feet from Gerti, level with her pretty face.\n The giantess didn\u0027t blink and didn\u0027t move. Drizzt could see her tightening her grip on the white stone arms of her great throne. She knew the panther could get to her before she could even raise her hands in defense. She knew Guenhwyvar\u0027s claws would tear at her blue and tender skin.\n Gerti swallowed hard.\n \"Perhaps now you are more in the mood for a bargain,\" Drizzt dared to say.\n Gerti flicked a hateful glance his way then her gaze snapped back to the threatening cat.\n \"She probably won\u0027t be able to kill you,\" Drizzt said, his freezing jaw hurting with every word. \"But oh, will anyone ever look upon Dame Gerti Orelsdottr again and marvel at her beauty? Take out her pretty eye, too, Guenhwyvar,\" Drizzt added. \"But only one, for she must see the expressions on the faces of those who look upon her scarred visage.\"\n \"Silence!\" Gerti growled at him. \"Your cat might wound me, but I can have you killed in an instant.\"\n \"And so we must bargain,\" Drizzt said without the slightest hesitation. \"For we both have much to lose.\"\n \"You wish to leave.\"\n \"I wish to sit by a fire first, that I might dry and warm myself. Drow are not so comfortable in the cold, particularly when we are wet.\"\n Gerti snorted derisively. \"My people bathe in that river, winter and summer,\" she boasted.\n \"Good! Then one of your warriors can retrieve my other scimitar. I seem to have dropped it under the ice.\"\n \"Your blade, your fire, your life, and your freedom,\" Gerti said. \"You ask for four concessions in your bargain.\"\n \"And I offer back your eye, your ear, your lips, and your beauty,\" Drizzt countered.\n Guenhwyvar growled, showing Gerti that the mighty panther understood every word, and was ready to strike at any time.\n \"Four to four,\" Drizzt went on. \"Come now, Gerti, what have you to gain by killing me?\"\n \"You invaded my home, drow.\"\n \"After you led the charge against mine.\"\n \"So I free you and you find your elf companion, and again you invade my home?\" Gerti asked.\n Drizzt nearly fell over with relief upon learning that Innovindil had indeed gotten away.\n \"We will come back at you only if you continue to hold that which belongs to us,\" said the drow.\n \"The winged horse.\"\n \"Does not belong as a pet in the caves of frost giants.\"\n Gerti snorted at him again, and Guenhwyvar roared and tamped down her hind legs.\n \"Surrender the pegasus to me and I will be on my way,\" said Drizzt. \"And Guenhwyvar will disappear and none of us will ever bother you again. But keep the pegasus, kill me if you will, and Guenhwyvar will have your face. And I warn you, Gerti Orelsdottr, that the elves of the Moonwood will come back for the winged horse, and the dwarves of Mithral Hall will join them. You will find no rest with your stolen pet.\"\n \"Enough!\" Gerti shouted at him, and to Drizzt\u0027s surprise, the giantess started to laugh.\n \"Enough, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden,\" she bade him in quieter tones. \"But you have asked me for something more; you have upped my end of the bargain.\"\n \"In return - \" Drizzt started to reply, but Gerti stopped him with an upraised hand.\n \"Tell me not of any more body parts your cat will allow me to keep,\" she said. \"No, I have a better bargain in mind. I will get your blade for you and let you warm before a great fire, all the while feasting on as much food as you could possibly eat. And I will allow you to walk out of Shining White - nay, to ride out on your precious winged horse, though it pains me to allow so beautiful a creature to wander away from me. I will do all this for you, and I will do more, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden.\"\n The drow could hardly believe what he was hearing, and that sentiment seemed common in that chamber, where many giants stood with their mouths drooping open in amazement.\n \"I am not your enemy,\" said Gerti. \"I never was.\"\n \"I watched your people bombard a tower with great boulders. My friends were in that tower.\"\n Gerti shrugged as if it did not matter and said, \"I, we, did not begin this war. We followed an orc of great stature.\"\n \"Obould Many-Arrows.\"\n \"Yes, curse his name.\"\n That raised Drizzt\u0027s eyebrows.\n \"You wish to kill him?\" Gerti asked.\n Drizzt didn\u0027t answer. He knew he didn\u0027t have to.\n \"I wish to witness such a battle,\" Gerti said with a vicious little grin. \"Perhaps I can deliver King Obould to you, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden. Would that interest you?\"\n Drizzt swallowed hard. \"Now it would seem that you have upped your own end of the bargain even more,\" he reasoned.\n \"Indeed I have, so accept it with two promises. First, you will kill Obould. Then you will broker a truce between Shining White and the surrounding kingdoms. King Bruenor\u0027s dwarves will not seek retribution upon my people, nor will Lady Alustriel, nor any other allies of Clan Battlehammer. It will be as if the giants of Shining White never partook in Obould\u0027s war.\"\n It took Drizzt a long time to digest the startling words. Why was Gerti doing this? To save her beauty, perhaps, but there was so much more going on than Drizzt could begin to understand. Gerti hated Obould, that much was obvious - could it be that she had come to fear him, as well? Or did she believe that the orc king would falter in the end, with or without her treason, and the result would prove disastrous for her people? Yes, if the dwarves of the three kingdoms joined with the folk of the three human kingdoms, would they stop with the orcs, or would they press on to exact revenge upon the giants as well?\n Drizzt glanced around and noted that many of the giants were nodding and grinning, and those whispering amongst themselves all seemed in complete accord with Gerti\u0027s proposal. He heard naysayers, but they were not loud and dominant.\n It began to make sense to Drizzt as he stood there shivering. If he won, then Gerti would be rid of a rival she surely despised, and if he lost, then Gerti would be no worse off.\n \"Orchestrate it,\" Drizzt said to her.\n \"Pick up your fallen scimitar, then, and dismiss your panther.\"\n Alarms went off in Drizzt\u0027s head, suspicion twisting his black face. But Gerti seemed even more relaxed.\n \"Before all my people, I give you my word, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden. Among the giants of the Spine of the World, our word is the most precious thing we own. If I deceive you now, would any of my people ever believe that I would not do the same to them?\"\n \"I am no frost giant, so I am inferior in your eyes,\" Drizzt argued.\n \"Of course you are,\" Gerti said with a chuckle. \"But that changes nothing. Besides, it will amuse me greatly to watch you battle King Obould. Speed against strength, a fighter\u0027s tactics against a savage fury. Yes, I will enjoy that. Greatly so.\" She finished and motioned toward the scimitar again.\n Drizzt stared her in the eye for a long moment.\n \"Be gone, Guenhwyvar,\" he instructed.\n The panther\u0027s ears flicked up and she turned to regard Drizzt curiously.\n \"If she betrays me, the next time you come to the material plane, seek her out and steal her beauty,\" Drizzt said.\n \"My word is not to be broken,\" said Gerti.\n \"Be gone, Guenhwyvar,\" Drizzt said again, and he stepped forward and retrieved Icingdeath. \"Go home and find your rest, and rest assured that I will call upon you again.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-two-swords-hunter-s-blades-3/page-24.html","bookId":2142,"book":{"id":2142,"title":"The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3) \n In The Two Swords, Obould\u0027s horde has pressed the Companions to the very gates of Mithral Hall, where Bruenor and his clan launch a desperate, last-ditch effort to push the orcs back.
