{"id":95794,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Dizzy and weak with hunger, his extremities numb, his fingers scraped and twisted from a dozen falls as he tried to make his way down the difficult mountain terrain, Nikwillig stubbornly put one foot in front of the other and staggered forward. He wasn\u0027t even sure where he was going anymore - just forward. A part of him wanted to simply lie down and expire, to be rid of the pain and the emptiness, both in his belly and in his thoughts.\\n\\n The past few days had not been kind to the poor dwarf from Citadel Felbarr. His food was gone, though there was plenty of water to be found. His clothing was torn in many places from various falls, including one that had him bouncing thirty feet down a rocky slope. That fall had left him senseless for nearly an hour, and had also left him weaponless. Somewhere in the descent, Nikwillig had dropped his short sword, and as luck would have it, the weapon had bounced into a narrow ravine, a deep crack really, between two huge slabs of solid stone. After he\u0027d gathered his sensibilities, the dwarf retraced his steps and had actually found the weapon, but alas, it lay beyond his short reach.\\n\\n He had fetched a small branch and tried again, using the stick to try to maneuver the sword at a better angle for grabbing. But the sword slipped from its unexpectedly precarious perch, clanking down to the deeper recesses of the cavity.\\n\\n With a helpless shrug, Nikwillig, who had never been much of a fighter anyway, had let it go at that. He didn\u0027t much care for the idea of being unarmed in hostile territory, with ugly orcs all around him, but he knew there was nothing more he could do.\\n\\n So as he had done after watching Nanfoodle\u0027s explosion and the dwarves\u0027 retreat, Nikwillig of Felbarr just shrugged with resignation. He continued on his way, moving generally east, though the trails were taking him more north than he had hoped.\\n\\n A few days later, the dwarf just stumbled along almost blindly. He kept repeating \"Surbrin\" over and over as a reminder, but most of the time, he didn\u0027t even know what the word meant. A dwarf\u0027s stubbornness alone kept him in motion.\\n\\n One foot in front of the other.\\n\\n He was on flatter ground, though he hardly knew it, and his progress was steady if not swift. Early in his journey, he had moved mostly at night, hiding in shallow caves during the daylight hours, but eventually it all seemed the same.\\n\\n It didn\u0027t matter. Nothing mattered, except putting one foot in front of the other and repeating the word, \"Surbrin.\"\\n\\n Suddenly, though, something else did matter.\\n\\n It came to Nikwillig on the breeze. Not a sight, nor a sound, but a smell. Something was cooking.\\n\\n The dwarf\u0027s stomach growled in response and he stopped his march, a moment of clarity falling over him. In mere seconds, his feet were moving again, of their own accord, it seemed. He veered to the side - he knew not whether it was left or right, or what direction. The aroma of cooking meat pulled him inexorably forward, and he leaned as he walked, and began licking his cracked, dirty lips.\\n\\n His sensibilities clarified further when he came in sight of the cooking fire, and of the chef, with its sickly dull orange skin, shock of wild black hair, and protruding lower jaw.\\n\\n Nothing could sober a dwarf like the sight of a goblin.\\n\\n The creature seemed oblivious to him. It hunched over the spit, pouring some gravy from a stone bowl.\\n\\n Nikwillig licked his lips again as he watched the thick liquid splatter over the juicy dark meat.\\n\\n Leg of lamb, Nikwillig thought and it took every ounce of control the battered dwarf could muster to not groan aloud, and not rush ahead blindly.\\n\\n He held his ground long enough to glance left and right. Seeing no other monsters about, the dwarf launched into a charge, lowering his head and running straight for the unwitting goblin chef.\\n\\n The goblin straightened, then turned around curiously just in time to catch a flying dwarf in the shoulder. Over the pair flew, upsetting the spit and scattering bits of the fire. They crashed down hard, the hot gravy flying wildly, most of it splashing the goblin in the face. The creature howled from the burns and tried to cover up, but Nikwillig grabbed it by its skinny throat with both hands. He lifted up and slammed down several times, then scrambled away, leaving the goblin whimpering and curling in the dirt.\\n\\n The leg of lamb, too, had landed on the ground and rolled in the dirt, but the dwarf didn\u0027t even stop to brush it clean. He grabbed it up in both hands and tore at it eagerly, ripping off large chunks of juicy meat and swallowing them with hardly a chew.\\n\\n A few bites in, Nikwillig paused long enough to catch his breath and to savor the taste.\\n\\n Shouts erupted all around him.\\n\\n The dwarf staggered up from his knees and began to run. A spear clipped his shoulder, but it skipped past without digging in. Good sense would have told Nikwillig to throw aside the meat and run full out, but in his famishment, the dwarf was far from good sense. Clutching the leg of lamb to his chest as dearly as if it was his only child, he charged along, weaving in and out of boulders and trees, trying to keep as much cover between him and the pursuing monsters as possible.\\n\\n He came out the side of a small copse and skidded to a stop, for he found himself on the edge of a low but steep descent. Below him, barely fifty feet away, the broad, shining River Surbrin rolled along its unstoppable way.\\n\\n \"The river...\" Nikwillig muttered, and he remembered then his goal when he had left his perch high on the mountain ridge north of Mithral Hall. If only he could get across the river!\\n\\n A shout behind him sent him running again, stumbling down the slope - one step, two. Then he went down hard, face first, and tucked himself just enough to launch himself in a roll. He gathered momentum, but did not let go of his precious cargo, rolling and bouncing all the way down until he splashed into the cold water.\\n\\n He pulled himself to his feet and staggered to the bank and tried to run along.\\n\\n Something punched him hard in the back, but he only yelled and continued his run.\\n\\n If only he could find a log. He\u0027d drag it into the river, and freezing water be damned, he\u0027d grab onto it and push himself out from the bank.\\n\\n Some trees ahead looked promising, but the shouts were sounding closer and Nikwillig feared he would not make it.\\n\\n And for some reason he did not immediately comprehend, his legs were moving more slowly, and were tingling as if they were going numb.\\n\\n The dwarf stopped and looked down, and saw blood - his own blood - dripping down to the ground between his widespread feet. He reached around and only then did he understand that the punch he\u0027d felt had been no punch at all, for his hand closed over the shaft of a goblin spear.\\n\\n \"O Moradin, ye\u0027re teasing me,\" Nikwillig said as he dropped to his knees.\\n\\n Behind him, he heard the hoots and shouts of charging goblins.\\n\\n He looked down at his hands, to the leg of lamb he still held, and with a shrug, he brought it up and tore off another chunk of meat.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t swallow as fast, though, but chewed that bite and rolled it around in his mouth, savoring its sweetness, its texture, and the warmth of it. It occurred to him that if he had a mug of mead in his other hand that would be a good way for a dwarf to die.\\n\\n He knew the goblins were close, but was surprised when a club smacked him off the back of the head, launching him face down in the dirt.\\n\\n Nikwillig of Citadel Felbarr tried to concentrate on the taste of the lamb, tried to block out the pain.\\n\\n He hoped that death would take him quickly.\\n\\n Then he knew no more. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-two-swords-hunter-s-blades-3/page-12.html","bookId":2142,"book":{"id":2142,"title":"The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3)","description":"Storyline: The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3) \\n In The Two Swords, Obould\u0027s horde has pressed the Companions to the very gates of Mithral Hall, where Bruenor and his clan launch a desperate, last-ditch effort to push the orcs back.
