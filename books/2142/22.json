{"id":95804,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Snow whipped all around them, forcing both Drizzt and Innovindil to bend low and lean into the wind to stop from being blown right over. The drow led the way, moving as swiftly as he could manage, for the trail of the giants remained clear to see, but would not last for long, he knew. Drizzt continually worked his fingers in his sleeve, clenching and unclenching his fist in a futile attempt to hold off the freezing. Innovindil had assured him that Shining White, the home of Gerti, was not far away. The drow hoped that was true, for he wasn\u0027t sure how long he and Innovindil could continue in such a blizzard.\n By mid-morning the trail was all but overblown and Drizzt kept moving as much on instinct as through his tracking abilities. He soldiered along as straight as he could manage, and veered from the course only when he came upon boulder tumbles or ravines that would have likely forced the giants\u0027 caravan aside.\n Around one such boulder tumble, the drow saw that he was guessing right, for there in the middle of a shallow dell was a pile of manure, half-covered and still steaming in the new-fallen snow. Drizzt made for it and bent low over it. He brought a gloved hand down and separated the pieces, inspecting each.\n \"No blood in the stool,\" he told Innovindil when she crouched near him.\n \"Sunrise is eating well, despite the onset of deep winter,\" the elf agreed.\n \"Gerti is treating him as she would a valued pet,\" said the drow. \"It bodes well.\"\n \"Except that we can be certain now that she will not easily give up the pegasus.\"\n \"Never was there any doubt of that,\" said Drizzt. \"We came here to fight for our friend, and so we shall.\" He looked up at Innovindil\u0027s fair face as he spoke the pledge, and saw that she appreciated his words. \"Come along,\" he bade her, and started on his way.\n Innovindil gave a tug on Sunset\u0027s reins to prompt the pegasus along, and followed with a renewed spring in her step.\n It didn\u0027t last long, though. The storm intensified, snow blowing across so fiercely that Innovindil and Drizzt could hardly see each other if they moved more than a few feet apart.\n They got a bit of a reprieve when they passed around an eastern spur, for the wind was from the northwest and suddenly both of those directions were blocked by mountain walls. Drizzt put his back against the bare stone and exhaled.\n \"If we can find a suitable overhang, perhaps we should put up for the day until the storm blows over,\" he offered, and he was glad that he was able to lower his voice without the wind to intercept and dissipate it.\n He took another deep breath and pulled the frozen cowl back from his face. He wiped the snow from his brow, chuckling helplessly when he realized that his eyebrows were iced over, and he looked at his companion to see that she was paying him no heed.\n \"Innovindil?\" he asked.\n \"No need,\" the elf answered. \"To camp, I mean.\"\n She met Drizzt\u0027s gaze then motioned for him to look across the way.\n The rock wall ran north for some distance, then bent back to the east. Along that facing, a few hundred yards from them, Drizzt saw a gaping darkness, a cave face in the stone.\n \"Shining White?\"\n \"Yes,\" Innovindil answered. \"An unremarkable entrance to a place rumored to be anything but.\"\n The two stood there a while, catching their breath.\n \"A plan?\" Innovindil finally asked.\n \"Sunrise is in there,\" Drizzt answered. \"So we go in.\"\n \"Just walk in?\"\n \"Swords drawn, of course.\" He turned to his companion and offered a grin.\n He made it sound so simple, which of course it was. They had come for Sunrise, and Sunrise was inside Shining White, and so they collected themselves and moved along, staying close to the mountain wall where the snow had not piled.\n A dozen feet or so before the closest edge of the cave entrance, Drizzt motioned for Innovindil to stay back and crept ahead. He came up straight at the edge of the cave, then slowly bent and turned and peeked in.\n He slipped around the edge, inching into a tunnel that widened almost immediately to nearly twenty feet across. The drow froze, hearing deep and steady breathing from across the way. He quick-stepped across the tunnel to the other wall, then crept along to an alcove.\n Inside, a seated giant leaned back against the wall, its hands tucked behind its head, lips flapping with every snore. A massive maul lay across its outstretched legs, the business end worked brilliantly into the design of an eagle\u0027s head, with the sharp, hooked beak comprising the back side of the head.\n Drizzt crept in. He could tell that the behemoth was sleeping soundly, and recognized that he could move right up and open wide its throat before it ever knew he was there. To his surprise, though, he found himself sliding his scimitars away. Gently, but with great effort, he lifted the maul from the giant\u0027s lap, and the beast snorted and grumbled, bringing one hand down and turning sideways.\n Drizzt moved out of the alcove and back to the cave entrance, where Innovindil and Sunset stood waiting.\n \"Fine weapon,\" he whispered, though it seemed as if he could hardly hold the maul.\n \"You killed its wielder?\" asked the elf.\n \"Fast asleep, and no threat to us.\"\n Innovindil\u0027s curious expression reminded Drizzt of his strange choice.\n Why hadn\u0027t he simply killed the giant; would that not be one less enemy to battle?\n His answer was just a shrug, though, and he put a finger to pursed lips and bade the elf to quietly follow.\n The three moved past the alcove on the opposite side of the corridor. Many feet farther along, the tunnel turned sharply to the right, and there the roof climbed much higher as well. A short way from the trio beamed a natural skylight, some fifty feet or more from the floor, the gray light of the stormy day streaming in. The floor became slick and some areas lay covered in snow. Farther down, a pair of large doors loomed before them.\n \"Let us hope that they are not locked, and that they are well greased,\" Innovindil quietly remarked.\n The three inched along, Sunset clip-clopping with every stride, the sharp echoes making the other two more than a little nervous. Both the drow and the elf entertained thoughts of leaving the pegasus outside, and would have had it not been for the brutal storm.\n Drizzt put his ear to the door and listened carefully for a long while before daring the handle - or almost daring the handle. For as he reached up, the ring being more than two feet above his head, he noted that its inner edge was not smooth, with one particularly sharp lip to it. He retracted his hand quickly.\n \"Trapped?\" Innovindil asked.\n Drizzt motioned that he did not know. He pulled off his cloak, then loosened his enchanted, armored shirt so that he could pull one sleeve down over his hand. He reached up again and slowly grasped the handle. He could feel the sharp edge through the shirt, and he gingerly altered the angle of his grasp so that the trap, if that\u0027s what it was, would not press on his palm.\n \"Ready to fight?\" he mouthed to his companion, and he drew out Icing-death in his left hand. When Innovindil nodded, Drizzt took a deep breath and pulled the door ajar, immediately snapping his hand down across his body to Twinkle, sheathed on his left hip.\n But the sight that greeted the two had their hands relaxing almost immediately. A warm glow washed out of the open door. Beyond the portal, that light reflected brilliantly off of a myriad of walls and partitions, all made of shining ice - not opaque and snowy, but clear and highly reflective. Images of a drow, an elf, and a pegasus came back at the companions from every conceivable angle.\n Drizzt stepped in and found himself lost in a sea of reflected Drizzts. The partitions were barely wide enough to admit a giant and sorted in a mazelike manner that set off alarm bells in the wary drow\u0027s mind as soon as he recovered from the initial shock of it all. He motioned to Innovindil to quickly follow and rushed ahead.\n \"What is it?\" the elf finally asked when she caught up to Drizzt as he paused at a four-way intersection of shiny ice walls.\n \"This is a defense,\" Drizzt replied.\n He looked around, soaking it in, confirming his fears. He noted the bare stone floor, in such a sharp contrast to the walls, which seemed to have no stone in them. He looked up to the many holes in the high ceiling, set strategically from east to west along the southern reaches of the chamber, designed, he realized, to catch the sunlight from dawn to twilight. Then he sorted through his images, following the line across the breadth of the huge chamber. A single sentry at any point along the wall would easily know of the intruders.\n Magic had created that hall of mirrors, Drizzt knew, and for a specific purpose.\n \"Move quickly,\" the drow said even as he started off.\n He dipped and darted his way through the maze, trying to find side aisles that would reflect him in a confusing manner to any sentries. He had to hope that any guards who might be posted to watch over the hall were, like the one in the previous tunnel, less than alert.\n No alarm horns had blown and no roars had come at him from afar. That was a good sign at least, he had to believe.\n Around one sharp bend, the drow pulled up short, and Innovindil, leading Sunset right behind him, nearly knocked him forward onto his face.\n Still Drizzt managed to hold back, absorbing the energy of the bump and skittering to the side instead of forward, for he did not want to take another step, did not want to step out onto the open, twenty-foot border of the eastern end of the cavern. That border was a river, and though it was iced over, Drizzt could clearly see the water rushing below the frozen surface.\n Across the way and down to his left, the drow spotted another tunnel.\n He motioned for Innovindil to carefully follow, then inched down the bank, stopping directly across from the exit tunnel. Up above him, he saw a large rope dangling - high enough for a giant to reach, perhaps, so that it might swing across.\n He heard Sunset clip-clopping back away from him and turned to see Innovindil astride the pegasus, angling to line him up for a straight run to the exit tunnel. With a grin, Drizzt sprinted back to her and clambered up behind her, and the elf wasted no time in putting Sunset into a quick run and a short leap, wings going out and beating hard. With grace more akin to a deer than a horse, Sunset alighted across the frozen river in the tunnel and Innovindil quickly pulled him up to a stop.\n Drizzt was down in a flash, Innovindil following.\n \"Do you think they know we\u0027re here?\" the moon elf asked.\n \"Does it matter?\"\n Now the corridors became more conventional, wide, high, and winding, maze-like, with many turns and side passages. The enormity of Shining White surprised Drizzt, and the enormity of their task became more than a little daunting.\n \"Guenhwyvar will smell Sunrise out,\" he said as he pulled out the figurine.\n \"More likely to smell your blood, I suspect,\" came an answer from a voice that was not Innovindil\u0027s, that was far too deep and resonant to belong to an elf.\n Drizzt turned slowly, as did his companion, and Sunset pawed the stone.\n A pair of frost giants stood calmly some twenty feet or so behind them, one with hands on her hips, the other holding a massive hammer in his right hand patting it onto his left.\n \"You bring a second pegasus for Dame Gerti,\" the female remarked. \"She will be pleased - perhaps enough so to allow you a quick death.\"\n Drizzt nodded and said, \"Aye, we have come to please Gerti, of course. That is our greatest desire.\"\n He slapped Sunset on the rump as he finished, and Innovindil went up astride the pegasus even as it leaped away.\n Drizzt turned to follow, took a few steps, then, hearing the giants charging in behind, he cut a quick turn and charged at them, howling with fury.\n \"Drizzt!\" Innovindil shouted, and he knew by her tone that she had concluded that he meant to engage the behemoths.\n Nothing could have been farther from his thoughts.\n He rushed at the one holding the hammer, and as it started to swing at him he cut to the right, toward the second giant.\n The first was too clever to continue its attack - an attack that likely would have struck its companion. But as the female behemoth reached for Drizzt he turned anyway again, back toward the first, his feet, their speed enhanced by magical anklets, moving in a blur. He dived into a roll, turning sidelong as he went so that he came up short and cut back to his right, which sent him rushing right between the giants. Both of them lurched in to grab at him, and the female might have had him, except that the pair knocked heads halfway down.\n Both grunted and straightened, and Drizzt ran free.\n Barely ten strides down the next corridor, though, the drow heard the shouts of more giants, and he had to turn into yet another perpendicular corridor so that he didn\u0027t run headlong into a behemoth.\n \"No dead ends,\" the drow whispered - a prayer if he ever heard one - with every blind turn.\n He soon came into a wider corridor lined on both sides with statues of various shapes and size. Most were of ice, though a few of stone. Some were giant-sized, but most reflected the stature of a human or an elf. The detailing and craftsmanship was as finely worked as dwarven stone, and the elegance of the artwork was not lost on the drow - the statues would not have seemed out of place in Menzoberranzan or in an elven village. He had little time to pause and admire the pieces, though, for he heard the giants behind him and in front, and horns blowing from deeper in the seemingly endless complex.\n He pulled his cloak from his shoulders and cut to the side, toward a cluster of several elf-sized statues.\n Innovindil could only hope that the floor stayed stone and was not glazed over with ice, for she could ill afford to allow Sunset to slow the run with giants scrambling all around her. She came upon corridor after corridor, turning sometimes and running straight at others, meaning to turn at some others and yet finding a group of enemies coming at her from that direction.... A blind run was the best the elf could manage. Or a blind flight, for every now and then she put the pegasus up into the air to gain speed. She had to take care, though, for airborne, Sunset could not navigate the sharp, right-angled turns. Innovindil watched ahead and behind, and looked up repeatedly. She kept hoping that the ceiling would open up before her so that she could lift Sunset into a short flight, perhaps one that would get them both out through a natural chimney or a worked skylight.\n At one corner, the elf and her pegasus nearly slammed into the stone wall, for the angle of the turn proved to be more than ninety degrees. Sunset skidded to a rough stop, brushing the stone as Innovindil brought the pegasus about.\n Innovindil sucked in her breath as they realigned and she prompted the pegasus to run again, for that moment of stillness left her vulnerable, she knew.\n And so she was only a little surprised when she saw a gigantic spear of ice - a long, shaped icicle - soaring at her from down the previous corridor. She ducked instinctively, and if she had not, she would have been skewered. Even with the near miss, the elf was almost dislodged, for the spear shattered on the stone above her and a barrage of ice chips showered over her.\n Stubbornly holding her seat, Innovindil kicked her heels into Sunset\u0027s flank and bade him to run on. She heard a shout behind her and to the side, from whence the spear had come, and she understood enough of the frost giant language, which was somewhat akin to Elvish, to understand that a giantess was berating the spear thrower.\n \"Do you want to hurt Gerti\u0027s new pet?\"\n \"The pegasus or the elf?\" the giant answered, his booming voice echoing off the stone behind Innovindil.\n \"Both, then!\" the giantess laughed.\n For some reason, their tone made Innovindil think that catching the spear in her chest would have been preferable.\n Two giants charged down the corridor, only occasionally glancing to either side until one suddenly lurched to the left and gave a victorious shout.\n The other yelled, \"Clever!\" when it, too, noticed the cloak on the statue - a cloak not carved of stone, but flowing as only fabric could.\n With a single stride to the side, the first giant brought a heavy club to bear, crushing down on the cloak. The ice statue beneath it exploded into a shower of shards and splinters.\n \"Oh, you broke Mardalade\u0027s work!\" the other shouted.\n \"T-the drow?\" the first stammered and dropped its club.\n \"Finds you quite amusing,\" came an answer from behind, and both giants spun around.\n Drizzt, skipping down the other way, paused long enough to offer a salute, then a smile as he pointed back behind the behemoths.\n Neither turned - until they heard the low growl of a giant panther.\n The two giants spun and ducked as six hundred pounds of black-furred muscle leaped over them, cutting close enough so that both threw up their hands and ducked even lower, one falling to the stone.\n Drizzt sprinted away. He used the moment of reprieve to try to sort out the maze of crisscrossing corridors. He listened carefully to the sounds all around him, too, trying to make some sense of them. Shouts from unrelated areas told him that Innovindil was still running, and gave him a fairly good idea of her general direction.\n He sprinted away, back to the west, then north, then west again. He heard the clip-clop of the running pegasus as he approached the next four-way intersection, and ran harder, thinking to catch hold of his friend as she passed through, and leap up behind her.\n But he slowed, quickly abandoning that notion. Better that the giants had two targets, he realized.\n Innovindil and Sunset crossed in front of him, head down and flying fast, with the pegasus a few feet off the ground. Though he could not help but pause and admire the elf\u0027s handling of the winged horse, Drizzt clearly heard the approach of giants not far behind. He picked up his pace again, and as a pair of giants ran through the intersection in fast pursuit of the elf, Drizzt rushed out right behind them, and managed to slash one in the back of the leg as he passed, drawing a howl of pain.\n That one stopped and the other slowed, both turning to regard the running dark elf.\n The wounded one then fell flat to his face, as a great panther sprang against the back of his neck, then leaped away. Three more giants poured into the intersection, and all five shouted wildly.\n \"Left!\"\n \"Right!\"\n \"Straight ahead!\"\n \"The elf, you fools!\"\n \"The drow!\"\n And all of that, of course, only gave Drizzt and Innovindil a bit more breathing room.\n Around and around they went, and Drizzt crossed corridors he recognized. At another intersection, he heard the clip-clop of Sunset\u0027s hooves again, and he got there first. Again he thought of jumping up astride the pegasus, and again he abandoned the notion, for still more giants bobbed along behind his fleeing companion.\n Drizzt stood at the corner, leaning out enough so that Innovindil noticed him. He pointed across the way, to the tunnel on the approaching Innovindil\u0027s left. She responded by bringing Sunset over to the right, near Drizzt, in a wider banking turn.\n \"Right, left, second right, and straight to the river!\" the drow shouted as she thundered past.\n Drizzt ducked back behind the corner. He heard giants approaching from behind him, as well as the ones coming in pursuit of Innovindil; he glanced both ways repeatedly and nervously, hoping that Innovindil\u0027s pursuit would arrive first.\n His relief was sincere and deep when he saw that they would. Still focusing on the pegasus-riding elf, the giants came on at full speed, and were caught by complete surprise when Drizzt leaped around the corner beside them and shouted at them.\n They stopped and fell all over themselves trying to get at him, and he ran off back the way they had come, and the confusion of all the giants increased many times over when the group previously chasing Drizzt also scrambled into the intersection in a wild tangle.\n Drizzt\u0027s smile widened; he couldn\u0027t deny that he was enjoying himself!\n But then he was in a storm of pelting sleet, a small black cloud roiling at the ceiling high overhead and stinging him with hailstones as big around as his feet. The stone below him grew almost instantly slick and he went into a controlled slide, holding his precarious balance.\n Of course, as soon as he hit a drier spot, his foot kicked out behind him and he had to fall into a roll. He looked back as he did, and noted one of the giantesses in the tumult of the intersection staring down his way and waggling her huge fingers once more.\n \"Oh, lovely,\" the drow said. He put his feet under him and ran off as fast as he could manage on the slippery floor.\n He sensed the lightning bolt an instant before it flashed, and he dived down and to the side. His fall sped along as the bolt clipped him. He had to ignore the burning and numbness in his arm, though, for the giants - both groups - came on in fast pursuit.\n Drizzt ran for his life, with all speed, hoping his guess of the layout was correct. He had sent Innovindil on a roundabout course that he hoped would get him to a specific intersection at the same time as the swifter pegasus. With the ice storm and the lightning bolt, that wouldn\u0027t happen even if his quick calculations had been correct.\n He saw her cross the intersection before him, in a straight run for the frozen river and the escape tunnels. She looked back as he came out right behind her, following her course.\n \"Run on!\" he cried, for he knew that she had no time to pause and wait. Giants were on his heels, including that nasty spellcaster - and wouldn\u0027t she love to have all the intruders in a line before her in a long, straight tunnel.\n \"Leap it! Fly across!\" Drizzt implored Innovindil as she neared the frozen river, and she did, bringing Sunset into a quick flight that carried her to solid ground on the other side. No fool, she, the elf pulled up on the reins, then turned the pegasus aside and moved down the bank, just a few feet out of the tunnel\u0027s line of sight.\n Drizzt came up on the river right behind her, the giants closing fast. Not even slowing in the least, the drow dived headlong, thinking to slide across and begin his run once more. He saw Innovindil as he hit the ice on his belly, the elf calling to him.\n He heard a loud grunt from the other side, to his right and up above, and rolled onto his side just in time to see a huge rock soaring down at him, thrown by a giant who was perched upon a ledge.\n \"Drizzt!\" Innovindil yelled.\n The drow tucked and turned, and caught a handhold, for he could see that the rock\u0027s aim had been true. Slowing his progress, he avoided being crushed, but the rock hit the ice right in front of him and crashed through. The drow, helpless in his slide, went into the icy waters.\n \"Drizzt!\" Innovindil yelled again.\n Hanging by a finger, the cold current pulling at him relentlessly, Drizzt managed to offer her a single shrug.\n Then he was gone. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-two-swords-hunter-s-blades-3/page-22.html","bookId":2142,"book":{"id":2142,"title":"The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Two Swords (Hunter\u0027s Blades #3) \n In The Two Swords, Obould\u0027s horde has pressed the Companions to the very gates of Mithral Hall, where Bruenor and his clan launch a desperate, last-ditch effort to push the orcs back.
