{"id":70203,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Police Sergeant Mankiewicz was on the telephone and he wasn\u0027t enjoying it. His conversation was sounding like a one-sided view of a firecracker. He was saying, \"That\u0027s right! He came in here and said, \u0027Put me in jail, because I want to kill myself.\u0027 \"... I can\u0027t help that. Those were his exact words. It sounds crazy to me, too. \"... Look, mister, the guy answers the description. You asked me for information and I\u0027m giving it to you. \"... He has exactly that scar on his right cheek and he said his name was John Smith. He didn\u0027t say it was Doctor anything-at-all. \"... Well, sure it\u0027s a phony. Nobody is named John Smith. Not in a police station, anyway. \"... He\u0027s in jail now. \"... Yes, I mean it. \"... Resisting an officer; assault and battery; malicious mischief. That\u0027s three counts. \"... I don\u0027t care who he is. \"... All right. I\u0027ll hold on.\" He looked up at Officer Brown and put his hand over the mouthpiece of the phone. It was a ham of a hand that nearly swallowed up the phone altogether. His blunt-featured face was ruddy and steaming under a thatch of pale-yellow hair. He said, \"Trouble! Nothing but trouble at a precinct station. I\u0027d rather be pounding a beat any day.\" \"Who\u0027s on the phone?\" asked Brown. He had just come in and didn\u0027t really care. He thought Mankiewicz would look better on a suburban beat, too. \"Oak Ridge. Long Distance. A guy called Grant. Head of somethingological division, and now he\u0027s getting somebody else at seventy-five cents a min... Hello!\" Mankiewicz got a new grip on the phone and held himself down. \"Look,\" he said, \"let me go through this from the beginning. I want you to get it straight and then if you don\u0027t like it, you can send someone down here. The guy doesn\u0027t want a lawyer. He claims he just wants to stay in jail and, brother, that\u0027s all right with me. \"Well, will you listen? He came in yesterday, walked right up to me, and said, \u0027Officer, I want you to put me in jail because I want to kill myself.\u0027 So I said, \u0027Mister, I\u0027m sorry you want to kill yourself. Don\u0027t do it, because if you do, you\u0027ll regret it the rest of your life.\u0027 \"... I am serious. I\u0027m just telling you what I said. I\u0027m not saying it was a funny joke, but I\u0027ve got my own troubles here, if you know what I mean. Do you think all I\u0027ve got to do here is to listen to cranks who walk in and - \"... Give me a chance, will you?\" I said, \u0027I can\u0027t put you in jail for wanting to kill yourself. That\u0027s no crime.\u0027 And he said, \u0027But I don\u0027t want to die.\u0027 So I said, \u0027Look, bud, get out of here.\u0027 I mean if a guy wants to commit suicide, all right, and if he doesn\u0027t want to, all right, but I don\u0027t want him weeping on my shoulder. \"... I\u0027m getting on with it. So he said to me. \u0027If I commit a crime, will you put me in jail?\" I said, \u0027If you\u0027re caught and if someone files a charge and you can\u0027t put up bail, we will. Now beat it.\u0027 So he picked up the inkwell on my desk and, before I could stop him, he turned it upside down on the open police blotter. \"... That\u0027s right! Why do you think we have \u0027malicious mischief tabbed on him? The ink ran down all over my pants. \"... Yes, assault and battery, too! I came hopping down to shake a little sense into him, and he kicked me in the shins and handed me one in the eye. \"... I\u0027m not making this up. You want to come down here and look at my face? \"... He\u0027ll be up in court one of these days. About Thursday, maybe. \"... Ninety days is the least he\u0027ll get, unless the psychos say otherwise. I think he belongs in the loony-bin myself. \"... Officially, he\u0027s John Smith. That\u0027s the only name he\u0027ll give. \"... No, sir, he doesn\u0027t get released without the proper legal steps. \"... O.K., you do that, if you want to, bud! I just do my job here.\" He banged the phone into its cradle, glowered at it, then picked it up and began dialing. He said \"Gianetti?\" got the proper answer and began talking. \"What\u0027s the A.E.C.? I\u0027ve been talking to some Joe on the phone and he says - \"... No, I\u0027m not kidding, lunk-head. If I were kidding, I\u0027d put up a sign. What\u0027s the alphabet soup?\" He listened, said, \"Thanks\" in a small voice and hung up again. He had lost some of his color. \"That second guy was the head of the Atomic Energy Commission,\" he said to Brown. \"They must have switched me from Oak Ridge to Washington.\" Brown lounged to his feet, \"Maybe the F.B.I, is after this John Smith guy. Maybe he\u0027s one of these here scientists.\" He felt moved to philosophy. \"They ought to keep atomic secrets away from those guys. Things were O.K. as long as General Groves was the only fella who knew about the atom bomb. Once they cut in these here scientists on it, though - \" \"Ah, shut up,\" snarled Mankiewicz. Dr. Oswald Grant kept his eyes fixed on the white line that marked the highway and handled the car as though it were an enemy of his. He always did. He was tall and knobby with a withdrawn expression stamped on his face. His knees crowded the wheel, and his knuckles whitened whenever he made a turn. Inspector Darrity sat beside him with his legs crossed so that the sole of his left shoe came up hard against the door. It would leave a sandy mark when he took it away. He tossed a nut-brown penknife from hand to hand. Earlier, he had unsheathed its wicked, gleaming blade and scraped casually at his nails as they drove, but a sudden swerve had nearly cost him a finger and he desisted. He said, \"What do you know about this Ralson?\" Dr. Grant took his eyes from the road momentarily, then returned them. He said, uneasily, \"I\u0027ve known him since he took his doctorate at Princeton. He\u0027s a very brilliant man.\" \"Yes? Brilliant, huh? Why is it that all you scientific men describe one another as \u0027brilliant\u0027? Aren\u0027t there any mediocre ones?\" \"Many. I\u0027m one of them. But Ralson isn\u0027t. You ask anyone. Ask Oppenheimer. Ask Bush. He was the youngest observer at Alamogordo.\" \"O.K. He was brilliant. What about his private life?\" Grant waited. \"I wouldn\u0027t know.\" \"You know him since Princeton. How many years is that?\" They had been scouring north along the highway from Washington for two hours with scarcely a word between them. Now Grant felt the atmosphere change and the grip of the law on his coat collar. \"He got his degree in \u002743.\" \"You\u0027ve known him eight years then.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"And you don\u0027t know about his private life?\" \"A man\u0027s life is his own, Inspector. He wasn\u0027t very sociable. A great many of the men are like that. They work under pressure and when they\u0027re off the job, they\u0027re not interested in continuing the lab acquaintanceships.\" \"Did he belong to any organizations that you know of?\" \"No.\" The inspector said, \"Did he ever say anything to you that might indicate he was disloyal?\" Grant shouted \"No!\" and there was silence for a while. Then Darrity said, \"How important is Ralson in atomic research?\" Grant hunched over the wheel and said, \"As important as any one man can be. I grant you that no one is indispensable, but Ralson has always seemed to be rather unique. He has the engineering mentality.\" \"What does that mean?\" \"He isn\u0027t much of a mathematician himself, but he can work out the gadgets that put someone else\u0027s math into life. There\u0027s no one like him when it comes to that. Time and again, Inspector, we\u0027ve had a problem to lick and no time to lick it in. There were nothing but blank minds all around until he put some thought into it and said, \u0027Why don\u0027t you try so-and-so?\u0027 Then he\u0027d go away. He wouldn\u0027t even be interested enough to see if it worked. But it always did. Always! Maybe we would have got it ourselves eventually, but it might have taken months of additional time. I don\u0027t know how he does it. It\u0027s no use asking him either. He just looks at you and says \u0027It was obvious\u0027, and walks away. Of course, once he\u0027s shown us how to do it, it is obvious.\" The inspector let him have his say out. When no more came, he said, \"Would you say he was queer, mentally? Erratic, you know.\" \"When a person is a genius, you wouldn\u0027t expect him to be normal, would you?\" \"Maybe not. But just how abnormal was this particular genius?\" \"He never talked, particularly. Sometimes, he wouldn\u0027t work.\" \"Stayed at home and went fishing instead?\" \"No. He came to the labs all right; but he would just sit at his desk. Sometimes that would go on for weeks. Wouldn\u0027t answer you, or even look at you, when you spoke to him.\" \"Did he ever actually leave work altogether?\" \"Before now, you mean? Never!\" \"Did he ever claim he wanted to commit suicide? Ever say he wouldn\u0027t feel safe except in jail?\" \"No.\" \"You\u0027re sure this John Smith is Ralson?\" \"I\u0027m almost positive. He has a chemical bum on his right cheek that can\u0027t be mistaken.\" \"O.K. That\u0027s that, then I\u0027ll speak to him and see what he sounds like.\" The silence fell for good this time. Dr. Grant followed the snaking line as Inspector Darrity tossed the penknife in low arcs from hand to hand. The warden listened to the call-box and looked up at his visitors. \"We can have him brought up here, Inspector, regardless.\" \"No,\" Dr. Grant shook his head. \"Let\u0027s go to him.\" Darrity said, \"Is that normal for Ralson, Dr. Grant? Would you expect him to attack a guard trying to take him out of a prison cell?\" Grant said, \"I can\u0027t say.\" The warden spread a calloused palm. His thick nose twitched a little. \"We haven\u0027t tried to do anything about him so far because of the telegram from Washington, but, frankly, he doesn\u0027t belong here. I\u0027ll be glad to have him taken off my hands.\" \"We\u0027ll see him in his cell,\" said Darrity. They went down the hard, barlined corridor. Empty, incurious eyes watched their passing. Dr. Grant felt his flesh crawl. \"Has he been kept here all the time?\" Darrity did not answer. The guard, pacing before them, stopped. \"This is the cell.\" Darrity said, \"Is that Dr. Ralson?\" Dr. Grant looked silently at the figure upon the cot. The man had been lying down when they first reached the cell, but now he had risen to one elbow and seemed to be trying to shrink into the wall. His hair was sandy and thin, his figure slight, his eyes blank and china-blue. On his right cheek there was a raised pink patch that tailed off like a tadpole. Dr. Grant said, \"That\u0027s Ralson.\" The guard opened the door and stepped inside, but Inspector Darrity sent him out again with a gesture. Ralson watched them mutely. He had drawn both feet up to the cot and was pushing backwards. His Adam\u0027s apple bobbled as he swallowed. Darrity said quietly, \"Dr. Elwood Ralson?\" \"What do you want?\" The voice was a surprising baritone. \"Would you come with us, please? We have some questions we would like to ask you.\" \"No! Leave me alone!\" \"Dr. Ralson,\" said Grant, \"I\u0027ve been sent here to ask you to come back to work.\" Ralson looked at the scientist and there was a momentary glint of something other than fear in his eyes. He said, \"Hello, Grant.\" He got off his cot. \"Listen, I\u0027ve been trying to have them put me into a padded cell. Can\u0027t you make them do that for me? You know me, Grant, I wouldn\u0027t ask for something I didn\u0027t feel was necessary. Help me. I can\u0027t stand the hard walls. It makes me want to... bash - \" He brought the flat of his palm thudding down against the hard, dull-gray concrete behind his cot. Darrity looked thoughtful. He brought out his penknife and unbent the Reaming blade. Carefully, he scraped at his thumbnail, and said, \"Would you like to see a doctor?\" But Ralson didn\u0027t answer that. He followed the gleam of metal and his lips parted and grew wet. His breath became ragged and harsh. He said, \"Put that away!\" Darrity paused. \"Put what away?\" \"The knife. Don\u0027t hold it in front of me. I can\u0027t stand looking at it.\" Darrity said, \"Why not?\" He held it out. \"Anything wrong with it? It\u0027s a good knife.\" Ralson lunged. Darrity stepped back and his left hand came down on the other\u0027s wrist. He lifted the knife high in the air. \"What\u0027s the matter, Ralson? What are you after?\" Grant cried a protest but Darrity waved him away. Darrity said, \"What do you want, Ralson?\" Ralson tried to reach upward, and bent under the other\u0027s appalling grip. He gasped, \"Give me the knife.\" \"Why, Ralson? What do you want to do with it?\" \"Please. I\u0027ve got to - \" He was pleading. \"I\u0027ve got to stop living.\" \"You want to die?\" \"No. But I must.\" Darrity shoved. Ralson flailed backward and tumbled into his cot, so that it squeaked noisily. Slowly, Darrity bent the blade of his penknife into its sheath and put it away. Ralson covered his face. His shoulders were shaking but otherwise he did not move. There was the sound of shouting from the corridor, as the other prisoners reacted to the noise issuing from Ralson\u0027s cell. The guard came hurrying down, yelling, \"Quiet!\" as he went. Darrity looked up. \"It\u0027s all right, guard.\" He was wiping his hands upon a large white handkerchief. \"I think we\u0027ll get a doctor for him.\" Dr. Gottfried Blaustein was small and dark and spoke with a trace of an Austrian accent. He needed only a small goatee to be the layman\u0027s caricature of a psychiatrist. But he was clean-shaven, and very carefully dressed. He watched Grant closely, assessing him, blocking in certain observations and deductions. He did this automatically, now, with everyone he met. He said, \"You give me a sort of picture. You describe a man of great talent, perhaps even genius. You tell me he has always been uncomfortable with people; that he has never fitted in with his laboratory environment, even though it was there that he met the greatest of success. Is there another environment to which he has fitted himself?\" \"I don\u0027t understand.\" \"It is not given to all of us to be so fortunate as to find a congenial type of company at the place or in the field where we find it necessary to make a living. Often, one compensates by playing an instrument, or going hiking, or joining some club. In other words, one creates a new type of society, when not working, in which one can feel more at home. It need not have the slightest connection with what one\u0027s ordinary occupation is. It is an escape, and not necessarily an unhealthy one.\" He smiled and added, \"Myself, I collect stamps. I am an active member of the American Society of Philatelists.\" Grant shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know what he did outside working hours. I doubt that he did anything like what you\u0027ve mentioned.\" \"Um-m-m. Well, that would be sad. Relaxation and enjoyment are wherever you find them; but you must find them somewhere, no?\" \"Have you spoken to Dr. Ralson, yet?\" \"About his problems? No.\" \"Aren\u0027t you going to?\" \"Oh, yes. But he has been here only a week. One must give him a chance to recover. He was in a highly excited state when he first came here. It was almost a delirium. Let him rest and become accustomed to the new environment. I will question him, then.\" \"Will you be able to get him back to work?\" Blaustein smiled. \"How should I know? I don\u0027t even know what his sickness is.\" \"Couldn\u0027t you at least get rid of the worst of it; this suicidal obsession of his, and take care of the rest of the cure while he\u0027s at work?\" \"Perhaps. I couldn\u0027t even venture an opinion so far without several interviews.\" \"How long do you suppose it will all take?\" \"In these matters, Dr. Grant, nobody can say.\" Grant brought his hands together in a sharp slap. \"Do what seems best then. But this is more important than you know.\" \"Perhaps. But you may be able to help me, Dr. Grant.\" \"How?\" \"Can you get me certain information which may be classified as top secret?\" \"What kind of information?\" \"I would like to know the suicide rate, since 1945, among nuclear scientists. Also, how many have left their jobs to go into other types of scientific work, or to leave science altogether.\" \"Is this in connection with Ralson?\" \"Don\u0027t you think it might be an occupational disease, this terrible unhappiness of his?\" \"Well - a good many have left their jobs, naturally.\" \"Why naturally, Dr. Grant?\" \"You must know how it is, Dr. Blaustein, The atmosphere in modern atomic research is one of great pressure and red tape. You work with the government; you work with military men. You can\u0027t talk about your work; you have to be careful what you say. Naturally, if you get a chance at a job in a university, where you can fix your own hours, do your own work, write papers that don\u0027t have to be submitted to the A.E.C., attend conventions that aren\u0027t held behind locked doors, you take it.\" \"And abandon your field of specialty forever.\" \"There are always non-military applications. Of course, there was one man who did leave for another reason. He told me once he couldn\u0027t sleep nights. He said he\u0027d hear one hundred thousand screams coming from Hiroshima, when he put the lights out. The last I heard of him he was a clerk in a haberdashery.\" \"And do you ever hear a few screams yourself?\" Grant nodded. \"It isn\u0027t a nice feeling to know that even a little of the responsibility of atomic destruction might be your own.\" \"How did Ralson feel?\" \"He never spoke of anything like that.\" \"In other words, if he felt it, he never even had the safety-valve effect of letting off steam to the rest of you.\" \"I guess he hadn\u0027t.\" \"Yet nuclear research must be done, no?\" \"I\u0027ll say.\" \"What would you do, Dr. Grant, if you felt you had to do something that you couldn\u0027t do.\" Grant shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Some people kill themselves.\" \"You mean that\u0027s what has Ralson down.\" \"I don\u0027t know. I do not know. I will speak to Dr. Ralson this evening. I can promise nothing, of course, but I will let you know whatever I can.\" Grant rose. \"Thanks, Doctor. I\u0027ll try to get the information you want.\" Elwood Ralson\u0027s appearance had improved in the week he had been at Dr. Blaustein\u0027s sanatorium. His face had filled out and some of the restlessness had gone out of him. He was tieless and beltless. His shoes were without laces. Blaustein said, \"How do you feel, Dr. Ralson?\" \"Rested.\" \"You have been treated well?\" \"No complaints, Doctor.\" Blaustein\u0027s hand fumbled for the letter-opener with which it was his habit to play during moments of abstraction, but his fingers met nothing. It had been put away, of course, with anything else possessing a sharp edge. There was nothing on his desk, now, but papers. He said, \"Sit down, Dr. Ralson. How do your symptoms progress?\" \"You mean, do I have what you would call a suicidal impulse? Yes. It gets worse or better, depending on my thoughts, I think. But it\u0027s always with me. There is nothing you can do to help.\" \"Perhaps you are right. There are often things I cannot help. But I would like to know as much as I can about you. You are an important man - \" Ralson snorted. \"You do not consider that to be so?\" asked Blaustein. \"No, I don\u0027t. There are no important men, any more than there are important individual bacteria.\" \"I don\u0027t understand.\" \"I don\u0027t expect you to.\" \"And yet it seems to me that behind your statement there must have been much thought. It would certainly be of the greatest interest to have you tell me some of this thought.\" For the first time, Ralson smiled. It was not a pleasant smile. His nostrils were white. He said, \"It is amusing to watch you, Doctor. You go about your business so conscientiously. You must listen to me, mustn\u0027t you, with just that air of phony interest and unctuous sympathy. I can tell you the most ridiculous things and still be sure of an audience, can\u0027t I?\" \"Don\u0027t you think my interest can be real, even granted that it is professional, too?\" \"No, I don\u0027t.\" \"Why not?\" \"I\u0027m not interested in discussing it.\" \"Would you rather return to your room?\" \"If you don\u0027t mind. No!\" His voice had suddenly suffused with fury as he stood up, then almost immediately sat down again. \"Why shouldn\u0027t I use you? I don\u0027t like to talk to people. They\u0027re stupid. They don\u0027t see things. They stare at the obvious for hours and it means nothing to them. If I spoke to them, they wouldn\u0027t understand; they\u0027d lose patience; they\u0027d laugh. Whereas you must listen. It\u0027s your job. You can\u0027t interrupt to tell me I\u0027m mad, even though you may think so.\" \"I\u0027d be glad to listen to whatever you would like to tell me.\" Ralson drew a deep breath. \"I\u0027ve known something for a year now, that very few people know. Maybe it\u0027s something no live person knows. Do you know that human cultural advances come in spurts? Over a space of two generations in a city containing thirty thousand free men, enough literary and artistic genius of the first rank arose to supply a nation of millions for a century under ordinary circumstances. I\u0027m referring to the Athens of Pericles. \"There are other examples. There is the Florence of the Medicis, the England of Elizabeth, the Spain of the Cordovan Emirs. There was the spasm of social reformers among the Israelites of the Eighth and Seventh centuries before Christ. Do you know what I mean?\" Blaustein nodded. \"I see that history is a subject that interests you.\" \"Why not? I suppose there\u0027s nothing that says I must restrict myself to nuclear cross-sections and wave mechanics.\" \"Nothing at all. Please proceed.\" \"At first, I thought I could learn more of the true inwardness of historical cycles by consulting a specialist. I had some conferences with a professional historian. A waste of time!\" \"What was his name; this professional historian?\" \"Does it matter?\" \"Perhaps not, if you would rather consider it confidential. What did he tell you?\" \"He said I was wrong; that history only appeared to go in spasms. He said that after closer studies the great civilizations of Egypt and Sumeria did not arise suddenly or out of nothing, but upon the basis of a long-developing sub-civilization that was already sophisticated in its arts. He said that Periclean Athens built upon a pre-Periclean Athens of lower accomplishments, without which the age of Pericles could not have been. \"I asked why was there not a post-Periclean Athens of higher accomplishments still, and he told me that Athens was ruined by a plague and by a long war with Sparta. I asked about other cultural spurts and each time it was a war that ended it, or, in some cases, even accompanied it. He was like all the rest. The truth was there; he had only to bend and pick it up; but he didn\u0027t.\" Ralson stared at the floor, and said in a tired voice, \"They come to me in the laboratory sometimes, Doctor. They say, \u0027How the devil are we going to get rid of the such-and-such effect that is ruining all our measurements, Ralson?\u0027 They show me the instruments and the wiring diagrams and I say, \u0027It\u0027s staring at you. Why don\u0027t you do so-and-so? A child could tell you that.\u0027 Then I walk away because I can\u0027t endure the slow puzzling of their stupid faces. Later, they come to me and say, \u0027It worked, Ralson. How did you figure it out?\u0027 I can\u0027t explain to them, Doctor; it would be like explaining that water is wet. And I couldn\u0027t explain to the historian. And I can\u0027t explain to you. It\u0027s a waste of time.\" \"Would you like to go back to your room?\" \"Yes.\" Blaustein sat and wondered for many minutes after Ralson had been escorted out of his office. His fingers found their way automatically into the upper right drawer of his desk and lifted out the letter-opener. He twiddled it in his fingers. Finally, he lifted the telephone and dialed the unlisted number he had been given. He said, \"This is Blaustein. There is a professional historian who was consulted by Dr. Ralson some time in the past, probably a bit over a year ago. I don\u0027t know his name. I don\u0027t even know if he was connected with a university. If you could find him, I would like to see him.\" Thaddeus Milton, Ph.D., blinked thoughtfully at Blaustein and brushed his hand through his iron-gray hair. He said, \"They came to me and I said that I had indeed met this man. However, I have had very little connection with him. None, in fact, beyond a few conversations of a professional nature.\" \"How did he come to you?\" \"He wrote me a letter; why me, rather than someone else, I do not know. A series of articles written by myself had appeared in one of the semi-learned journals of semi-popular appeal about that time. It may have attracted his attention.\" \"I see. With what general topic were the articles concerned?\" \"They were a consideration of the validity of the cyclic approach to history. That is, whether one can really say that a particular civilization must follow laws of growth and decline in any matter analogous to those involving individuals.\" \"I have read Toynbee, Dr. Milton.\" \"Well, then, you know what I mean.\" Blaustein said, \"And when Dr. Ralson consulted you, was it with reference to this cyclic approach to history?\" \"U-m-m-m. In a way, I suppose. Of course, the man is not an historian and some of his notions about cultural trends are rather dramatic and... what shall I say... tabloidish. Pardon me, Doctor, if I ask a question which may be improper. Is Dr. Ralson one of your patients?\" \"Dr. Ralson is not well and is in my care. This, and all else we say here, is confidential, of course.\" \"Quite. I understand that. However, your answer explains something to me. Some of his ideas almost verged on the irrational. He was always worried, it seemed to me, about the connection between what he called \u0027cultural spurts\u0027 and calamities of one sort or another. Now such connections have been noted frequently. The time of a nation\u0027s greatest vitality may come at a time of great national insecurity. The Netherlands is a good case in point. Her great artists, statesmen, and explorers belong to the early Seventeenth Century at the time when she was locked in a death struggle with the greatest European power of the time, Spain. When at the point of destruction at home, she was building an empire in the Far East and had secured footholds on the northern coast of South America, the southern tip of Africa, and the Hudson Valley of North America. Her fleets fought England to a standstill. And then, once her political safety was assured, she declined. \"Well, as I say, that is not unusual. Groups, like individuals, will rise to strange heights in answer to a challenge, and vegetate in the absence of a challenge. Where Dr. Ralson left the paths of sanity, however, was in insisting that such a view amounted to confusing cause and effect. He declared that it was not times of war and danger that stimulated \u0027cultural spurts\u0027, but rather vice versa. He claimed that each time a group of men snowed too much vitality and ability, a war became necessary to destroy the possibility of their further development.\" \"I see,\" said Blaustein. \"I rather laughed at him, I am afraid. It may be that that was why he did not keep the last appointment we made. Just toward the end of that last conference he asked me, in the most intense fashion imaginable, whether I did not think it queer that such an improbable species as man was dominant on earth, when all he had in his favor was intelligence. There I laughed aloud. Perhaps I should not have, poor fellow.\" \"It was a natural reaction,\" said Blaustein, \"but I must take no more of your time. You have been most helpful.\" They shook hands, and Thaddeus Milton took his leave. \"Well,\" said Darrity, \"there are your figures on the recent suicides among scientific personnel. Get any deductions out of it?\" \"I should be asking you that,\" said Blaustein, gently. \"The F.B.I, must have investigated thoroughly.\" \"You can bet the national debt on that. They are suicides. There\u0027s no mistake about it. There have been people checking on it in another department. The rate is about four times above normal, taking age, social status, economic class into consideration.\" \"What about British scientists?\" \"Just about the same.\" \"And the Soviet Union?\" \"Who can tell?\" The investigator leaned forward. \"Doc, you don\u0027t think the Soviets have some sort of ray that can make people want to commit suicide, do you? It\u0027s sort of suspicious that men in atomic research are the only ones affected.\" \"Is it? Perhaps not. Nuclear physicists may have peculiar strains imposed upon them. It is difficult to tell without thorough study.\" \"You mean complexes might be coming through?\" asked Darrity, warily. Blaustein made a face. \"Psychiatry is becoming too popular. Everybody talks of complexes and neuroses and psychoses and compulsions and whatnot. One man\u0027s guilt complex is another man\u0027s good night\u0027s sleep. If I could talk to each one of the men who committed suicide, maybe I could know something.\" \"You\u0027re talking to Ralson.\" \"Yes, I\u0027m talking to Ralson.\" \"Has he got a guilt complex?\" \"Not particularly. He has a background out of which it would not surprise me if he obtained a morbid concern with death. When he was twelve he saw his mother die under the wheels of an automobile. His father died slowly of cancer. Yet the effect of those experiences on his present troubles is not clear.\" Darrity picked up his hat. \"Well, I wish you\u0027d get a move on, Doc. There\u0027s something big on, bigger than the H-Bomb. I don\u0027t know how anything can be bigger than that, but it is.\" Ralson insisted on standing. \"I had a bad night last night, Doctor.\" \"I hope,\" said Blaustein, \"these conferences are not disturbing you.\" \"Well, maybe they are. They have me thinking on the subject again. It makes things bad, when I do that. How do you imagine it feels being part of a bacterial culture, Doctor?\" \"I had never thought of that. To a bacterium, it probably feels quite normal.\" Ralson did not hear. He said, slowly, \"A culture in which intelligence is being studied. We study all sorts of things as far as their genetic relationships are concerned. We take fruit flies and cross red eyes and white eyes to see what happens. We don\u0027t care anything about red eyes and white eyes, but we try to gather from them certain basic genetic principles. You see what I mean?\" \"Certainly.\" \"Even in humans, we can follow various physical characteristics. There are the Hapsburg lips, and the hemophilia that started with Queen Victoria and cropped up in her descendants among the Spanish and Russian royal families. We can even follow feeble-mindedness in the Jukeses and Kallikakas. You learn about it in high-school biology. But you can\u0027t breed human beings the way you do fruit flies. Humans live too long. It would take centuries to draw conclusions. It\u0027s a pity we don\u0027t have a special race of men that reproduce at weekly intervals, eh?\" He waited for an answer, but Blaustein only smiled. Ralson said, \"Only that\u0027s exactly what we would be for another group of beings whose life span might be thousands of years. To them, we would reproduce rapidly enough. We would be short-lived creatures and they could study the genetics of such things as musical aptitude, scientific intelligence, and so on. Not that those things would interest them as such, any more than the white eyes of the fruit fly interest us as white eyes.\" \"This is a very interesting notion,\" said Blaustein. \"It is not simply a notion. It is true. To me, it is obvious, and I don\u0027t care how it seems to you. Look around you. Look at the planet, Earth. What kind of a ridiculous animal are we to be lords of the world after the dinosaurs had failed? Sure, we\u0027re intelligent, but what\u0027s intelligence? We think it is important because we have it. If the Tyrannosaurus could have picked out the one quality that he thought would ensure species domination, it would be size and strength. And he would make a better case for it. He lasted longer than we\u0027re likely to. \"Intelligence in itself isn\u0027t much as far as survival values are concerned. The elephant makes out very poorly indeed when compared to the sparrow even though he is much more intelligent. The dog does well, under man\u0027s protection, but not as well as the housefly against whom every human hand is raised. Or take the primates as a group. The small ones cower before their enemies; the large ones have always been remarkably unsuccessful in doing more than barely holding their own. The baboons do the best and that is because of their canines, not their brains.\" A light film of perspiration covered Ralson\u0027s forehead. \"And one can see that man has been tailored, made to careful specifications for those things that study us. Generally, the primate is short-lived. Naturally, the larger ones live longer, which is a fairly general rule in animal life. Yet the human being has a life span twice as long as any of the other great apes; considerably longer even than the gorilla that outweighs him. We mature later. It\u0027s as though we\u0027ve been carefully bred to live a little longer so that our life cycle might be of a more convenient length.\" He jumped to his feet, shaking his fists above his head. \"A thousand years are but as yesterday - \" Blaustein punched a button hastily. For a moment, Ralson struggled against the white-coated orderly who entered, and then he allowed himself to be led away. Blaustein looked after him, shook his head, and picked up the telephone. He got Darrity. \"Inspector, you may as well know that this may take a long time.\" He listened and shook his head. \"I know. I don\u0027t minimize the urgency.\" The voice in the receiver was tinny and harsh. \"Doctor, you are minimizing it. I\u0027ll send Dr. Grant to you. He\u0027ll explain the situation to you.\" Dr. Grant asked how Ralson was, then asked somewhat wistfully if he could see him. Blaustein shook his head gently. Grant said, \"I\u0027ve been directed to explain the current situation in atomic research to you.\" \"So that I will understand, no?\" \"I hope so. It\u0027s a measure of desperation. I\u0027ll have to remind you - \" \"Not to breathe a word of it. Yes, I know. This insecurity on the part of you people is a very bad symptom. You must know these things cannot be hidden.\" \"You live with secrecy. It\u0027s contagious.\" \"Exactly. What is the current secret?\" \"There is... or, at least, there might be a defense against the atomic bomb.\" \"And that is a secret? It would be better if it were shouted to all the people of the world instantly.\" \"For heaven\u0027s sake, no. Listen to me, Dr. Blaustein. It\u0027s only on paper so far. It\u0027s at the E equal me square stage, almost. It may not be practical. It would be bad to raise hopes we would have to disappoint. On the other hand, if it were known that we almost had a defense, there might be a desire to start and win a war before the defense were completely developed.\" \"That I don\u0027t believe. But, nevertheless, I distract you. What is the nature of this defense, or have you told me as much as you dare?\" \"No, I can go as far as I like; as far as is necessary to convince you we have to have Ralson - and fast!\" \"Well, then tell me, and I too, will know secrets. I\u0027ll feel like a member of the Cabinet.\" \"You\u0027ll know more than most. Look, Dr. Blaustein, let me explain it in lay language. So far, military advances have been made fairly equally in both offensive and defensive weapons. Once before there seemed to be a definite and permanent tipping of all warfare in the direction of the offense, and that was with the invention of gunpowder. But the defense caught up. The medieval man-in-armor-on-horse became the modern man-in-tank-on-treads, and the stone castle became the concrete pillbox. The same thing, you see, except that everything has been boosted several orders of magnitude.\" \"Very good. You make it clear. But with the atomic bomb comes more orders of magnitude, no? You must go past concrete and steel for protection.\" \"Right. Only we can\u0027t just make thicker and thicker walls. We\u0027ve run out of materials that are strong enough. So we must abandon materials altogether. If the atom attacks, we must let the atom defend. We will use energy itself; a force field.\" \"And what,\" asked Blaustein, gently, \"is a force field?\" \"I wish I could tell you. Right now, it\u0027s an equation on paper. Energy can be so channeled as to create a wall of matterless inertia, theoretically. In practice, we don\u0027t know how to do it.\" \"It would be a wall you could not go through, is that it? Even for atoms?\" \"Even for atom bombs. The only limit on its strength would be the amount of energy we could pour into it. It could even theoretically be made to be impermeable to radiation. The gamma rays would bounce off it. What we\u0027re dreaming of is a screen that would be in permanent place about cities; at minimum strength, using practically no energy. It could then be triggered to maximum intensity in a fraction of a millisecond at the impingement of short-wave radiation; say the amount radiating from the mass of plutonium large enough to be an atomic war head. All this is theoretically possible.\" \"And why must you have Ralson?\" \"Because he is the only one who can reduce it to practice, if it can be made practical at all, quickly enough. Every minute counts these days. You know what the international situation is. Atomic defense must arrive before atomic war.\" \"You are so sure of Ralson?\" \"I am as sure of him as I can be of anything. The man is amazing, Dr. Blaustein. He is always right. Nobody in the field knows how he does it.\" \"A sort of intuition, no?\" the psychiatrist looked disturbed. \"A kind of reasoning that goes beyond ordinary human capacities. Is that it?\" \"I make no pretense of knowing what it is.\" \"Let me speak to him once more then. I will let you know.\" \"Good.\" Grant rose to leave; then, as if in afterthought, he said, \"I might say, Doctor, that if you don\u0027t do something, the Commission plans to take Dr. Ralson out of your hands.\" \"And try another psychiatrist? If they wish to do that, of course, I will not stand in their way. It is my opinion, however, that no reputable practitioner will pretend there is a rapid cure.\" \"We may not intend further mental treatment. He may simply be returned to work.\" \"That, Dr. Grant, I will fight. You will get nothing out of him. It will be his death.\" \"We get nothing out of him anyway.\" \"This way there is at least a chance, no?\" \"I hope so. And by the way, please don\u0027t mention the fact that I said anything about taking Ralson away.\" \"I will not, and I thank you for the warning. Good-bye, Dr. Grant.\" \"I made a fool of myself last time, didn\u0027t I, Doctor?\" said Ralson. He was frowning. \"You mean you don\u0027t believe what you said then?\" \"I do!\" Ralson\u0027s slight form trembled with the intensity of his affirmation. He rushed to the window, and Blaustein swiveled in his chair to keep him in view. There were bars in the window. He couldn\u0027t jump. The glass was unbreakable. Twilight was ending, and the stars were beginning to come out. Ralson stared at them in fascination, then he turned to Blaustein and flung a finger outward. \"Every single one of them is an incubator. They maintain temperatures at the desired point. Different experiments; different temperatures. And the planets that circle them are just huge cultures, containing different nutrient mixtures and different life forms. The experimenters are economical, too - whatever and whoever they are. They\u0027ve cultured many types of life forms in this particular test-tube. Dinosaurs in a moist, tropical age and ourselves among the glaciers. They turn the sun up and down and we try to work out the physics of it. Physics!\" He drew his lips back in a snarl. \"Surely,\" said Dr. Blaustein, \"it is not possible that the sun can be turned up and down at will.\" \"Why not? It\u0027s just like a heating element in an oven. You think bacteria know what it is that works the heat that reaches them? Who knows? Maybe they evolve theories, too. Maybe they have their cosmogonies about cosmic catastrophes, in which clashing light-bulbs create strings of Petri dishes. Maybe they think there must be some beneficent creator that supplies them with food and warmth and says to them, \u0027Be fruitful and multiply!\u0027 \"We breed like them, not knowing why. We obey the so-called laws of nature which are only our interpretation of the not-understood forces imposed upon us. \"And now they\u0027ve got the biggest experiment of any yet on their hands. It\u0027s been going on for two hundred years. They decided to develop a strain for mechanical aptitude in England in the seventeen hundreds, I imagine. We call it the Industrial Revolution. It began with steam, went on to electricity, then atoms. It was an interesting experiment, but they took their chances on letting it spread. Which is why they\u0027ll have to be very drastic indeed in ending it.\" Blaustein said, \"And how would they plan to end it? Do you have an idea about that?\" \"You ask me how they plan to end it. You can look about the world today and still ask what is likely to bring our technological age to an end. All the earth fears an atomic war and would do anything to avoid it; yet all the earth fears that an atomic war is inevitable.\" \"In other words, the experimenters will arrange an atom war whether we want it or not, to kill off the technological era we are in, and to start fresh. That is it, no?\" \"Yes. It\u0027s logical. When we sterilize an instrument, do the germs know where the killing heat comes from? Or what has brought it about? There is some way the experimenters can raise the heat of our emotions; some way they can handle us that passes our understanding.\" \"Tell me,\" said Blaustein, \"is that why you want to die? Because you think the destruction of civilization is coming and can\u0027t be stopped?\" Ralson said, \"I don\u0027t want to die. It\u0027s just that I must.\" His eyes were tortured. \"Doctor, if you had a culture of germs that were highly dangerous and that you had to keep under absolute control, might you not have an agar medium impregnated with, say, penicillin, in a circle at a certain distance from the center of inoculation? Any germs spreading out too far from the center would die. You would have nothing against the particular germs who were killed; you might not even know that any germs had spread that far in the first place. It would be purely automatic. \"Doctor, there is a penicillin ring about our intellects. When we stray too far; when we penetrate the true meaning of our own existence, we have reached into the penicillin and we must die. It works slowly - but it\u0027s hard to stay alive.\" He smiled briefly and sadly. Then he said, \"May I go back to my room now, Doctor?\" Dr. Blaustein went to Ralson\u0027s room about noon the next day. It was a small room and featureless. The walls were gray with padding. Two small windows were high up and could not be reached. The mattress lay directly on the padded floor. There was nothing of metal in the room; nothing that could be utilized in tearing life from body. Even Ralson\u0027s nails were clipped short., Ralson sat up. \"Hello!\" \"Hello, Dr. Ralson. May I speak to you?\" \"Here? There isn\u0027t any seat I can offer you.\" \"It is all right. I\u0027ll stand. I have a sitting job and it is good for my sitting-down place that I should stand sometimes. Dr. Ralson, I have thought all night of what you told me yesterday and in the days before.\" \"And now you are going to apply treatment to rid me of what you think are delusions.\" \"No. It is just that I wish to ask questions and perhaps to point out some consequences of your theories which... you will forgive me?... you may not have thought of.\" \"Oh?\" \"You see, Dr. Ralson, since you have explained your theories, I, too, know what you know. Yet I have no feeling about suicide.\" \"Belief is more than something intellectual, Doctor. You\u0027d have to believe this with all your insides, which you don\u0027t.\" \"Do you not think perhaps it is rather a phenomenon of adaptation?\" \"How do you mean?\" \"You are not really a biologist, Dr. Ralson. And although you are very brilliant indeed in physics, you do not think of everything with respect to these bacterial cultures you use as analogies. You know that it is possible to breed bacterial strains that are resistant to penicillin or to almost any bacterial poison.\" \"Well?\" \"The experimenters who breed us have been working with humanity for many generations, no? And this particular strain which they have been culturing for two centuries shows no sign of dying out spontaneously. Rather, it is a vigorous strain and a very infective one. Older high-culture strains were confined to single cities or to small areas and lasted only a generation or two. This one is spreading throughout the world. It is a very infective strain. Do you not think it may have developed penicillin immunity? In other words, the methods the experimenters use to wipe out the culture may not work too well any more, no?\" Ralson shook his head. \"It\u0027s working on me.\" \"You are perhaps non-resistant. Or you have stumbled into a very high concentration of penicillin indeed. Consider all the people who have been trying to outlaw atomic warfare and to establish some form of world government and lasting peace. The effort has risen in recent years, without too awful results.\" \"It isn\u0027t stopping the atomic war that\u0027s coming.\" \"No, but maybe only a little more effort is all that is required. The peace advocates do not kill themselves. More and more humans are immune to the experimenters. Do you know what they are doing in the laboratory?\" \"I don\u0027t want to know.\" \"You must know. They are trying to invent a force field that will stop the atom bomb. Dr. Ralson, if I am culturing a virulent and pathological bacterium; then, even with all precautions, it may sometimes happen that I will start a plague. We may be bacteria to them, but we are dangerous to them, also, or they wouldn\u0027t wipe us out so carefully after each experiment. \"They are not quick, no? To them a thousand years is as a day, no? By the time they realize we are out of the culture, past the penicillin, it will be too late for them to stop us. They have brought us to the atom, and if we can only prevent ourselves from using it upon one another, we may turn out to be too much even for the experimenters.\" Ralson rose to his feet. Small though he was, he was an inch and a half taller than Blaustein. \"They are really working on a force field?\" \"They are trying to. But they need you.\" \"No. I can\u0027t.\" \"They must have you in order that you might see what is so obvious to you. It is not obvious to them. Remember, it is your help, or else - defeat of man by the experimenters.\" Ralson took a few rapid steps away, staring into the blank, padded wall. He muttered, \"But there must be that defeat. If they build a force field, it will mean death for all of them before it can be completed.\" \"Some or all of them may be immune, no? And in any case, it will be death for them anyhow. They are trying.\" Ralson said, \"I\u0027ll try to help them.\" \"Do you still want to kill yourself?\" \"Yes.\" \"But you\u0027ll try not to, no?\" \"I\u0027ll try not to, Doctor.\" His lip quivered. \"I\u0027ll have to be watched.\" Blaustein climbed the stairs and presented his pass to the guard in the lobby. He had already been inspected at the outer gate, but he, his pass, and its signature were now scrutinized once again. After a moment, the guard retired to his little booth and made a phone call. The answer satisfied him. Blaustein took a seat and, in half a minute, was up again, shaking hands with Dr. Grant. \"The President of the United States would have trouble getting in here, no?\" said Blaustein. The lanky physicist smiled. \"You\u0027re right, if he came without warning.\" They took an elevator which traveled twelve floors. The office to which Grant led the way had windows in three directions. It was sound-proofed and air-conditioned. Its walnut furniture was in a state of high polish. Blaustein said, \"My goodness. It is like the office of the chairman of a board of directors. Science is becoming big business.\" Grant looked embarrassed. \"Yes, I know, but government money flows easily and it is difficult to persuade a congressman that your work is important unless he can see, smell, and touch the surface shine.\" Blaustein sat down and felt the upholstered seat give way slowly. He said, \"Dr. Elwood Ralson has agreed to return to work.\" \"Wonderful. I was hoping you would say that. I was hoping that was why you wanted to see me.\" As though inspired by the news, Grant offered the psychiatrist a cigar, which was refused. \"However,\" said Blaustein, \"he remains a very sick man. He will have to be treated carefully and with insight.\" \"Of course. Naturally.\" \"It\u0027s not quite as simple as you may think. I want to tell you something of Ralson\u0027s problems, so that you will really understand how delicate the situation is.\" He went on talking and Grant listened first in concern, and then in astonishment. \"But then the man is out of his head, Dr. Blaustein. He\u0027ll be of no use to us. He\u0027s crazy.\" Blaustein shrugged. \"It depends on how you define \u0027crazy.\u0027 It\u0027s a bad word; don\u0027t use it. He had delusions, certainly. Whether they will affect his peculiar talents one cannot know.\" \"But surely no sane man could possibly - \" \"Please. Please. Let us not launch into long discussions on psychiatric definitions of sanity and so on. The man has delusions and, ordinarily, I would dismiss them from all consideration. It is just that I have been given to understand that the man\u0027s particular ability lies in his manner of proceeding to the solution of a problem by what seems to be outside ordinary reason. That is so, no?\" \"Yes. That must be admitted.\" \"How can you and I judge then as to the worth of one of his conclusions. Let me ask you, do you have suicidal impulses lately?\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" \"And other scientists here?\" \"No, of course not.\" \"I would suggest, however, that while research on the force field proceeds, the scientists concerned be watched here and at home. It might even be a good enough idea that they should not go home. Offices like these could be arranged to be a small dormitory - \" \"Sleep at work. You would never get them to agree.\" \"Oh, yes. If you do not tell them the real reason but say it is for security purposes, they will agree. \u0027Security purposes\u0027 is a wonderful phrase these days, no? Ralson must be watched more than anyone.\" \"Of course.\" \"But all this is minor. It is something to be done to satisfy my conscience in case Ralson\u0027s theories are correct. Actually, I don\u0027t believe them. They are delusions, but once that is granted, it is necessary to ask what the causes of those delusions are. What is it in Ralson\u0027s mind, in his background, in his life that makes it so necessary for him to have these particular delusions? One cannot answer that simply. It may well take years of constant psychoanalysis to discover the answer. And until the answer is discovered, he will not be cured. \"But, meanwhile, we can perhaps make intelligent guesses. He has had an unhappy childhood, which, in one way or another, has brought him face to face with death in very unpleasant fashion. In addition, he has never been able to form associations with other children, or, as he grew older, with other men. He was always impatient with their slower forms of reasoning. Whatever difference there is between his mind and that of others, it has built a wall between him and society as strong as the force field you are trying to design. For similar reasons, he has been unable to enjoy a normal sex life. He has never married; he has had no sweethearts. \"It is easy to see that he could easily compensate to himself for this failure to be accepted by his social milieu by taking refuge in the thought that other human beings are inferior to himself. Which is, of course, true, as far as mentality is concerned. There are, of course, many, many facets to the human personality and in not all of them is he superior. No one is. Others, then, who are more prone to see merely what is inferior, just as he himself is, would not accept his affected preeminence of position. They would think him queer, even laughable, which would make it even more important to Ralson to prove how miserable and inferior the human species was. How could he better do that than to show that mankind was simply a form of bacteria to other superior creatures which experiment upon them. And then his impulses to suicide would be a wild desire to break away completely from being a man at all; to stop this identification with the miserable species he has created in his mind. You see?\" Grant nodded. \"Poor guy.\" \"Yes, it is a pity. Had he been properly taken care of in childhood - Well, it is best for Dr. Ralson that he have no contact with any of the other men here. He is too sick to be trusted with them. You, yourself, must arrange to be the only man who will see him or speak to him. Dr. Ralson has agreed to that. He apparently thinks you are not as stupid as some of the others.\" Grant smiled faintly. \"That is agreeable to me.\" \"You will, of course, be careful. I would not discuss anything with him but his work. If he should volunteer information about his theories, which I doubt, confine yourself to something noncommittal, and leave. And at all times, keep away anything that is sharp and pointed. Do not let him reach a window. Try to have his hands kept in view. You understand. I leave my patient in your care, Dr. Grant.\" \"I will do my best, Dr. Blaustein.\" For two months, Ralson lived in a comer of Grant\u0027s office, and Grant lived with him. Gridwork had been built up before the windows, wooden furniture was removed and upholstered sofas brought in. Ralson did his thinking on the couch and his calculating on a desk pad atop a hassock. The \"Do Not Enter\" was a permanent fixture outside the office. Meals were left outside. The adjoining men\u0027s room was marked off for private use and the door between it and the office removed. Grant switched to an electric razor. He made certain that Ralson took sleeping pills each night and waited till the other slept before sleeping himself. And always reports were brought to Ralson. He read them while Grant watched and tried to seem not to watch. Then Ralson would let them drop and stare at the ceiling, with one hand shading his eyes. \"Anything?\" asked Grant. Ralson shook his head from side to side. Grant said, \"Look, I\u0027ll clear the building during the swing shift. It\u0027s important that you see some of the experimental jigs we\u0027ve been setting up.\" They did so, wandering through the lighted, empty buildings like drifting ghosts, hand in hand. Always hand in hand. Grant\u0027s grip was tight. But after each trip, Ralson would still shake his head from side to side. Half a dozen times he would begin writing; each time there would be a few scrawls and then he would kick the hassock over on its side. Until, finally, he began writing once again and covered half a page rapidly. Automatically, Grant approached. Ralson looked up, covering the sheet of paper with a trembling hand. He said, \"Call Blaustein.\" \"What?\" \"I said, \u0027Call Blaustein.\u0027 Get him here. Now!\" Grant moved to the telephone. Ralson was writing rapidly now, stopping only to brush wildly at his forehead with the back of a hand. It came away wet. He looked up and his voice was cracked, \"Is he coming?\" Grant looked worried. \"He isn\u0027t at his office.\" \"Get him at his home. Get him wherever he is. Use that telephone. Don\u0027t play with it.\" Grant used it; and Ralson pulled another sheet toward himself. Five minutes later, Grant said, \"He\u0027s coming. What\u0027s wrong? You\u0027re looking sick.\" Ralson could speak only thickly, \"No time - Can\u0027t talk - \" He was writing, scribbling, scrawling, shakily diagramming. It was as though he were driving his hands, fighting it. \"Dictate!\" urged Grant. \"I\u0027ll write.\" Ralson shook him off. His words were unintelligible. He held his wrist with his other hand, shoving it as though it were a piece of wood, and then he collapsed over the papers. Grant edged them out from under and laid Ralson down on the couch. He hovered over him restlessly and hopelessly until Blaustein arrived. Blaustein took one look. \"What happened?\" Grant said, \"I think he\u0027s alive,\" but by that time Blaustein had verified that for himself, and Grant told him what had happened. Blaustein used a hypodermic and they waited. Ralson\u0027s eyes were blank when they opened. He moaned. Blaustein leaned close. \"Ralson.\" Ralson\u0027s hands reached out blindly and clutched at the psychiatrist. \"Doc. Take me back.\" \"I will. Now. It is that you have the force field worked out, no?\" \"It\u0027s on the papers. Grant, it\u0027s on the papers.\" Grant had them and was leafing through them dubiously. Ralson said, weakly, \"It\u0027s not all there. It\u0027s all I can write. You\u0027ll have to make it out of that. Take me back, Doc!\" \"Wait,\" said Grant. He whispered urgently to Blaustein. \"Can\u0027t you leave him here till we test this thing? I can\u0027t make out what most of this is. The writing is illegible. Ask him what makes him think this will work.\" \"Ask him?\" said Blaustein, gentry. \"Isn\u0027t he the one who always knows?\" \"Ask me, anyway,\" said Ralson, overhearing from where he lay on the couch. His eyes were suddenly wide and blazing. They turned to him. He said, \"They don\u0027t want a force field. They! The experimenters! As long as I had no true grasp, things remained as they were. But I hadn\u0027t followed up that thought - that thought which is there in the papers - I hadn\u0027t followed it up for thirty seconds before I felt... I felt - Doctor - \" Blaustein said, \"What is it?\" Ralson was whispering again, \"I\u0027m deeper in the penicillin. I could feel myself plunging in and in, the further I went with that. I\u0027ve never been in... so deep. That\u0027s how I knew I was right. Take me away.\" Blaustein straightened. \"I\u0027ll have to take him away, Grant. There\u0027s no alternative. If you can make out what he\u0027s written, that\u0027s it. If you can\u0027t make it out, I can\u0027t help you. That man can do no more work in his field without dying, do you understand?\" \"But,\" said Grant, \"he\u0027s dying of something imaginary.\" \"All right. Say that he is. But he will be really dead just the same, no?\" Ralson was unconscious again and heard nothing of this. Grant looked at him somberly, then said, \"Well, take him away, then.\" Ten of the top men at the Institute watched glumly as slide after slide filled the illuminated screen. Grant faced them, expression hard and frowning. He said, \"I think the idea is simple enough. You\u0027re mathematicians and you\u0027re engineers. The scrawl may seem illegible, but it was done with meaning behind it. That meaning must somehow remain in the writing, distorted though it is. The first page is clear enough. It should be a good lead. Each one of you will look at every page over and over again. You\u0027re going to put down every possible version of each page as it seems it might be. You will work independently. I want no consultations.\" One of them said, \"How do you know it means anything, Grant?\" \"Because those are Ralson\u0027s notes.\" \"Ralson! I thought he was - \" \"You thought he was sick,\" said Grant. He had to shout over the rising hum of conversation. \"I know. He is. That\u0027s the writing of a man who was nearly dead. It\u0027s all we\u0027ll ever get from Ralson, any more. Somewhere in that scrawl is the answer to the force field problem. If we can\u0027t find it, we may have to spend ten years looking for it elsewhere.\" They bent to their work. The night passed. Two nights passed. Three nights - Grant looked at the results. He shook his head. \"I\u0027ll take your word for it that it is all self-consistent. I can\u0027t say I understand it.\" Lowe, who, in the absence of Ralson, would readily have been rated the best nuclear engineer at the Institute, shrugged. \"It\u0027s not exactly clear to me. If it works, he hasn\u0027t explained why.\" \"He had no time to explain. Can you build the generator as he describes it?\" \"I could try.\" \"Would you look at all the other versions of the pages?\" \"The others are definitely not self-consistent.\" \"Would you double-check?\" \"Sure.\" \"And could you start construction anyway?\" \"I\u0027ll get the shop started. But I tell you frankly that I\u0027m pessimistic.\" \"I know. So am I.\" The thing grew. Hal Ross, Senior Mechanic, was put in charge of the actual construction, and he stopped sleeping. At any hour of the day or night, he could be found at it, scratching his bald head. He asked questions only once, \"What is it, Dr. Lowe? Never saw anything like it? What\u0027s it supposed to do?\" Lowe said, \"You know where you are, Ross. You know we don\u0027t ask questions here. Don\u0027t ask again.\" Ross did not ask again. He was known to dislike the structure that was being built. He called it ugly and unnatural. But he stayed at it. Blaustein called one day. Grant said, \"How\u0027s Ralson?\" \"Not good. He wants to attend the testing of the Field Projector he designed.\" Grant hesitated, \"I suppose we should. It\u0027s his after all.\" \"I would have to come with him.\" Grant looked unhappier. \"It might be dangerous, you know. Even in a pilot test, we\u0027d be playing with tremendous energies.\" Blaustein said, \"No more dangerous for us than for you.\" \"Very well. The list of observers will have to be cleared through the Commission and the F.B.I., but I\u0027ll put you in.\" Blaustein looked about him. The field projector squatted in the very center of the huge testing laboratory, but all else had been cleared. There was no visible connection with the plutonium pile which served as energy-source, but from what the psychiatrist heard in scraps about him - he knew better than to ask Ralson - the connection was from beneath. At first, the observers had circled the machine, talking in incomprehensibles, but they were drifting away now. The gallery was filling up. There were at least three men in generals\u0027 uniforms on the other side, and a real coterie of lower-scale military. Blaustein chose an unoccupied portion of the railing; for Ralson\u0027s sake, most of all. He said, \"Do you still think you would like to stay?\" It was warm enough within the laboratory, but Ralson was in his coat, with his collar turned up. It made little difference, Blaustein felt. He doubted that any of Ralson\u0027s former acquaintances would now recognize him. Ralson said, \"I\u0027ll stay.\" Blaustein was pleased. He wanted to see the test. He turned again at a new voice. \"Hello, Dr. Blaustein.\" For a minute, Blaustein did not place him, then he said, \"Ah, Inspector Darrity. What are you doing here?\" \"Just what you would suppose.\" He indicated the watchers. \"There isn\u0027t any way you can weed them out so that you can be sure there won\u0027t be any mistakes. I once stood as near to Klaus Fuchs as I am standing to you.\" He tossed his pocketknife into the air and retrieved it with a dexterous motion. \"Ah, yes. Where shall one find perfect security? What man can trust even his own unconscious? And you will now stand near to me, no?\" \"Might as well.\" Darrity smiled. \"You were very anxious to get in here, weren\u0027t you?\" \"Not for myself, Inspector. And would you put away the knife, please.\" Darrity turned in surprise in the direction of Blaustein\u0027s gentle hand gesture. He put his knife away and looked at Blaustein\u0027s companion for the second time. He whistled softly. He said, \"Hello, Dr. Ralson.\" Ralson croaked, \"Hello.\" Blaustein was not surprised at Darrity\u0027s reaction. Ralson had lost twenty pounds since returning to the sanatorium. His face was yellow and wrinkled; the face of a man who had suddenly become sixty. Blaustein said, \"Will the test be starting soon?\" Darrity said, \"It looks as if they\u0027re starting now.\" He turned and leaned on the rail. Blaustein took Ralson\u0027s elbow and began leading him away, but Darrity said, softly, \"Stay here, Doc. I don\u0027t want you wandering about.\" Blaustein looked across the laboratory. Men were standing about with the uncomfortable air of having turned half to stone. He could recognize Grant, tall and gaunt, moving his hand slowly to light a cigarette, then changing his mind and putting lighter and cigarette in his pocket. The young men at the control panels waited tensely. Then there was a low humming and the faint smell of ozone filled the air. Ralson said harshly, \"Look!\" Blaustein and Darrity looked along the pointing finger. The projector seemed to flicker. It was as though there were heated air rising between it and them. An iron ball came swinging down pendulum fashion and passed through the flickering area. \"It slowed up, no?\" said Blaustein, excitedly. Ralson nodded. \"They\u0027re measuring the height of rise on the other side to calculate the loss of momentum. Fools! I said it would work.\" He was speaking with obvious difficulty. Blaustein said, \"Just watch, Dr. Ralson. I would not allow myself to grow needlessly excited.\" The pendulum was stopped in its swinging, drawn up. The flickering about the projector became a little more intense and the iron sphere arced down once again. Over and over again, and each time the sphere\u0027s motion was slowed with more of a jerk. It made a clearly audible sound as it struck the flicker. And eventually, it bounced. First, soggily, as though it hit putty, and then ringingly, as though it hit steel, so that the noise filled the place. They drew back the pendulum bob and used it no longer. The projector could hardly be seen behind the haze that surrounded it. Grant gave an order and the odor of ozone was suddenly sharp and pungent. There was a cry from the assembled observers; each one exclaiming to his neighbor. A dozen fingers were pointing. Blaustein leaned over the railing, as excited as the rest. Where the projector had been, there was now only a huge semi-globular mirror. It was perfectly and beautifully clear. He could see himself in it, a small man standing on a small balcony that curved up on each side. He could see the fluorescent lights reflected in spots of glowing illumination. It was wonderfully sharp. He was shouting, \"Look, Ralson. It is reflecting energy. It is reflecting light waves like a mirror. Ralson - \" He turned, \"Ralson! Inspector, where is Ralson?\" \"What?\" Darrity whirled. \"I haven\u0027t seen him.\" He looked about, wildly. \"Well, he won\u0027t get away. No way of getting out of here now. You take the other side.\" And then he clapped hand to thigh, fumbled for a moment in his pocket, and said, \"My knife is gone.\" Blaustein found him. He was inside the small office belonging to Hal Ross. It led off the balcony, but under the circumstances, of course, it had been deserted. Ross himself was not even an observer. A senior mechanic need not observe. But his office would do very well for the final end of the long fight against suicide. Blaustein stood in the doorway for a sick moment, then turned. He caught Darrity\u0027s eye as the latter emerged from a similar office a hundred feet down the balcony. He beckoned, and Darrity came at a run. Dr. Grant was trembling with excitement. He had taken two puffs at each of two cigarettes and trodden each underfoot thereafter. He was fumbling with the third now. He was saying, \"This is better than any of us could possibly have hoped. We\u0027ll have the gunfire test tomorrow. I\u0027m sure of the result now, but we\u0027ve planned it; we\u0027ll go through with it. We\u0027ll skip the small arms and start with the bazooka levels. Or maybe not. It might be necessary to construct a special testing structure to take care of the ricochet problem.\" He discarded his third cigarette. A general said, \"We\u0027d have to try a literal atom-bombing, of course.\" \"Naturally. Arrangements have already been made to build a mock-city at Eniwetok. We could build a generator on the spot and drop the bomb. There\u0027d be animals inside.\" \"And you really think if we set up a field in full power it would hold the bomb?\" \"It\u0027s not just that, general. There\u0027d be no noticeable field at all until the bomb is dropped. The radiation of the plutonium would have to energize the field before explosion. As we did here in the last step. That\u0027s the essence of it all.\" \"You know,\" said a Princeton professor, \"I see disadvantages, too. When the field is on full, anything it protects is in total darkness, as far as the sun is concerned. Besides that, it strikes me that the enemy can adopt the practice of dropping harmless radioactive missiles to set off the field at frequent intervals. It would have nuisance value and be a considerable drain on our pile as well.\" \"Nuisances,\" said Grant, \"can be survived. These difficulties will be met eventually, I\u0027m sure, now that the main problem has been solved.\" The British observer had worked his way toward Grant and was shaking hands. He said, \"I feel better about London already. I cannot help but wish your government would allow me to see the complete plans. What I have seen strikes me as completely ingenious. It seems obvious now, of course, but how did anyone ever come to think of it?\" Grant smiled. \"That question has been asked before with reference to Dr. Ralson\u0027s devices - \" He turned at the touch of a hand upon his shoulder. \"Dr. Blaustein! I had nearly forgotten. Here, I want to talk to you.\" He dragged the small psychiatrist to one side and hissed in his ear, \"Listen, can you persuade Ralson to be introduced to these people? This is his triumph.\" Blaustein said, \"Ralson is dead.\" \"What!\" \"Can you leave these people for a time?\" \"Yes... yes - Gentlemen, you will excuse me for a few minutes?\" He hurried off with Blaustein. The Federal men had already taken over. Unobtrusively, they barred the doorway to Ross\u0027s office. Outside there were the milling crowd discussing the answer to Alamogordo that they had just witnessed. Inside, unknown to them, was the death of the answerer. The G-man barrier divided to allow Grant and Blaustein to enter. It closed behind them again. For a moment, Grant raised the sheet. He said, \"He looks peaceful.\" \"I would say - happy,\" said Blaustein. Darrity said, colorlessly, \"The suicide weapon was my own knife. It was my negligence; it will be reported as such.\" \"No, no,\" said Blaustein, \"that would be useless. He was my patient and I am responsible. In any case, he would not have lived another week. Since he invented the projector, he was a dying man.\" Grant said, \"How much of this has to be placed in the Federal files? Can\u0027t we forget all about his madness?\" \"I\u0027m afraid not, Dr. Grant,\" said Darrity. \"I have told him the whole story,\" said Blaustein, sadly. Grant looked from one to the other. \"I\u0027ll speak to the Director. I\u0027ll go to the President, if necessary. I don\u0027t see that there need be any mention of suicide or of madness. He\u0027ll get full publicity as inventor of the field projector. It\u0027s the least we can do for him.\" His teeth were gritting. Blaustein said, \"He left a note.\" \"A note?\" Darrity handed him a sheet of paper and said, \"Suicides almost always do. This is one reason the doctor told me about what really killed Ralson.\" The note was addressed to Blaustein and it went: \"The projector works; I knew it would. The bargain is done. You\u0027ve got it and you don\u0027t need me any more. So I\u0027ll go. You needn\u0027t worry about the human race, Doc. You were right. They\u0027ve bred us too long; they\u0027ve taken too many chances. We\u0027re out of the culture now and they won\u0027t be able to stop us. I know. That\u0027s all I can say. I know.\" He had signed his name quickly and then underneath there was one scrawled line, and it said: \"Provided enough men are penicillin-resistant.\" Grant made a motion to crumple the paper, but Darrity held out a quick hand. \"For the record, Doctor,\" he said. Grant gave it to him and said, \"Poor Ralson! He died believing all that trash.\" Blaustein nodded. \"So he did. Ralson will be given a great funeral, I suppose, and the fact of his invention will be publicized without the madness and the suicide. But the government men will remain interested in his mad theories. They may not be so mad, no, Mr. Darrity?\" \"That\u0027s ridiculous, Doctor,\" said Grant. \"There isn\u0027t a scientist on the job who has shown the least uneasiness about it at all.\" \"Tell him, Mr. Darrity,\" said Blaustein. Darrity said, \"There has been another suicide. No, no, none of the scientists. No one with a degree. It happened this morning, and we investigated because we thought it might have some connection with today\u0027s test. There didn\u0027t seem any, and we were going to keep it quiet till the test was over. Only now there seems to be a connection. \"The man who died was just a guy with a wife and three kids. No reason to die. No history of mental illness. He threw himself under a car. We have witnesses, and it\u0027s certain he did it on purpose. He didn\u0027t die right away and they got a doctor to him. He was horribly mangled, but his last words were \u0027I feel much better now\u0027 and he died.\" \"But who was he?\" cried Grant. \"Hal Ross. The guy who actually built the projector. The guy whose office this is.\" Blaustein walked to the window. The evening sky was darkening into starriness. He said, \"The man knew nothing about Ralson\u0027s views. He had never spoken to Ralson, Mr. Darrity tells me. Scientists are probably resistant as a whole. They must be or they are quickly driven out of the profession. Ralson was an exception, a penicillin-sensitive who insisted on remaining. You see what happened to him. But what about the others; those who have remained in walks of life where there is no constant weeding out of the sensitive ones. How much of humanity is penicillin-resistant?\" \"You believe Ralson?\" asked Grant in horror. \"I don\u0027t really know.\" Blaustein looked at the stars.
