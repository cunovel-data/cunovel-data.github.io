{"id":109932,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"PRAYER\\n\\n CHAPTER ELEVEN\\n\\n Are you all right?\" Marlene knelt beside Shabazz and waited for him to answer, both second-sight and eyes scanning him for any additional injuries that might have been overlooked. She quickly glanced at the spot on the floor where Damali and Carlos had been, hoping that the Neteru Council would be able to help them. But right now, Shabazz was her primary concern.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I\u0027m all right,\" he said after a long pause and then looked up at Big Mike, who was standing near with Ayana up high in his arms. \"Lost my pants in the hall, bro. The shape-shift thing ain\u0027t gotno modesty.\" He forced a laugh and began to cover himself before trying to stand.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m on it, bro. Don\u0027t nobody care about all that, so long as you cool and ain\u0027t nicked.\" Mike hustled out into the hall with the baby as female Guardians lowered their gazes. He handed Ayana off to Krissy and then tossed Shabazz his jeans, and Shabazz caught them with one hand.\\n\\n Marlene monitored Shabazz as he unfurled his exquisite ebony body and deftly pulled on his pants. His aura was intact. The blue-white current of tactical energy still crackled through his magnificent dark locks. His eyes were clear and he was completely lucid. He spoke with his back to the group, zipping his pants, but hadn\u0027t missed a beat as the senior Guardian team leader.\\n\\n \"All right.We just saw some deep shit,\" Shabazz said in a matter-of-fact tone, then turned around, folding his arms over his chiseled chest. Intermittent tension still ran through his body and made his biceps twitch. \"We\u0027ve got newbies in the house, and you all just saw live action on probably one of the worst days to join this team. Regardless, it is what it is. But you\u0027re going to have to come up to speed real quick, to avoid an incident like the one we just saw in here tonight.\"\\n\\n Everybody looked down uncomfortably, especially Inez.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll talk to her, \u0027Bazz,\" Inez said quietly.\\n\\n \"Talk to me, talk to me?\" Inez\u0027s mother shrieked. \"Did you just see what happened? Have you all been-\"\\n\\n \"Stop,\" Shabazz said low in his throat.\\n\\n The sound that came out of Shabazz was so close to a jaguar\u0027s growl that Mrs. Filgueiras drew back. Even Big Mike looked unsure. Shabazz unfolded his arms and rubbed the nape of his neck, locks crackling hard with static.\\n\\n \"No, Inez. Tonight, I\u0027m going to break it down for young and old, new and senior-because we don\u0027t have time to tap-dance around so-called niceties. Mrs. Filgueiras, you are going to have to pull it together.Pure and simple. You ain\u0027t visiting your daughter, moving into a summer guest house with her and her new husband and kid. You are in the equivalent of a damned wartime military facility!\"\\n\\n Shabazz walked back and forth like a caged feline, his grace and swiftness unnerving to the uninitiated. When Delores Filgueiras started to cry, he spun on her. \"Suck it up,\" Shabazz commanded in an even, deadly tone, bearing upper and lower canines.\\n\\n \" \u0027Bazz-\"\\n\\n \"No, Marlene,\" Shabazz argued, squaring off with Marlene. \"Delores came in here, freaked, screamed, drew Damali\u0027s attention at a critical strike point, and our girl got the snot kicked out of her by a demon serpent. The baby took it better than Delores did. Ayana just did what you\u0027re supposed to do, instinctively, and she scrambled to a safe spot, hunkered down, and got out of gunfire range.\" He closed his eyes and counted to twenty, regaining his Zen and composure after a moment. Once his canines receded, he addressed the group, rubbing his palms down his face.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have to stay and deal with this insanity, and I don\u0027t have to listen to whatever he says,\" Mrs. Filgueiras said, her voice shaking. \"He\u0027s got the teeth of a demon, oh, my God-and electric, what is he? I am leaving here, getting away from you people, this life, this . . . this abomination! You can\u0027t keep me here against my will. I\u0027ll go to the police! My granddaughter-\"\\n\\n \"Stays,\" Inez said coolly, unexpectedly rounding on her mother. \"You saw with your own eyes what\u0027s out there. Ayana stays.\"\\n\\n \"In here, amid this? Are you insane?\" her mother challenged, getting up in Inez\u0027s face. \"I\u0027ll call child protective services on you. I\u0027ll get my grandbaby.\"\\n\\n \"And as much as it will break my heart, Momma,\" Inez said, lifting her chin, \"I will make sure they believe you are insane, getting early-onset Alzheimer\u0027s, and you won\u0027t stand a chance. Don\u0027t make me go there . . . I love you.\"\\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t . . .\"\\n\\n \"Yes. I would,\" Inez said, folding her arms over her chest.\"Because, here, Ayana has a fighting chance. Out there, with what\u0027s happening in the world, without me and my family around her to protect her, she\u0027s dog meat. If you can\u0027t see that, then I don\u0027t know what to tell you. But I refuse to bury my child because you don\u0027t want your feelings hurt. You\u0027d better listen to Shabazz and suck it up.\"\\n\\n \"How can you disrespect me in front of these people? If you went to church more you\u0027d know that you\u0027re supposed to honor your mother and father! I amyour mother and I say we go! You call yourself surrounded by people of faith-what faith? You want to raise a child in this house of horrors? You have serpents in your house, naked people who turn into animals . . . have all sorts of-\"\\n\\n \"Listen, let\u0027s get it out once and for all,\" Inez shouted, making her mother back up.\"Honor? Honor!Don\u0027t you dare throwstones. I had the same gift as my daughter. I told you things were happening to me at the hands of your husband, but you didn\u0027t want to see it. You wanted to be blind because at that time, blind was convenient. It\u0027s only because Damali saved me from it happening even more by almost killing that rat bastard and running away that you had to finally see for yourself.\" Inez walked back and forth and slapped a wall. \"That said, I have and still do respect you-but I\u0027m not taking no unnecessary guilt trips and drama along the way, Momma. I\u0027m a soldier and good and grown . . . yeah, Momma, I grewa lot while away from you. I came into my own and I like who I am now. Plus, I came with serious squad to pull you and my child out of harm\u0027s way. But since you wanna talk about faith, let\u0027s go there!\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t go there, baby,\" Mike said softly, trying to calm Inez down. \"Some things you say can\u0027t betook back.\"\\n\\n She snatched away from his touch and whirled on her mother. \"This,right here, that I\u0027m about to say-I don\u0027t wanna take back!\"\\n\\n Inez circled her mother, her voice dropping low and lethal. \"You went to church day and night and lived there to avoid seeing the truth and to avoid living your life. But you were hiding! So-called in the world and not of it, but talking about people, who\u0027s wearing what, who ain\u0027t tithing like they should, whose kids are bad . . . not helping a soul, not advancing any cause other than the social. That\u0027s how the Devil gets up in a church in the end of days, ain\u0027t you figured that out by now?\"\\n\\n Her mother turned away, but Inez followed her, circling her as Delores Filgueiras tried to shut out her daughter\u0027s words by closing her eyes as the team silently watched.\\n\\n \"You claim you have faith, Momma . . . and every time something kicks off on the news, you holler, \u0027Girl, just look at how these folks act-it must assuredly be like pastorsays, the end of days.\u0027 But now, when Scripture comes to life, when it is as real and tangible and up in your face as a live demon, a true spiritual battle between good and evil that\u0027s not some theoretical future-tense possibility, when it boils down to what are you gonna do and what are you willing to sacrifice-you want out.\" Inez stepped back. \"It don\u0027t work like that, Momma.\"\\n\\n Mrs. Filgueiras wrapped her arms around herself and swallowed hard, seeming too stricken to even cry.\\n\\n \"You always talking about how you living in the world but not of it . . . how you believe in angels and the power of the Word. Yeah, okay. Well, it\u0027s show time. Here\u0027s how it works, Mom. If youtruly believe and you have on whatever is the symbol of your faith-in a firefight, you might be able to hold that up and back the demon up. But if you\u0027ve got what we call up in here, \u0027Sunday morning faith,\u0027\" Inez said, making little quote signs in the air with her fingers, \"that demon will laugh at you and snatch your lungs out. It\u0027s a lotta differentfaiths on this team, a lot of different races and cultures, but we\u0027re allone family and the glue is, we all believe in good winning over evil.Period.\"\\n\\n Inez walked away and lifted her braids off her neck, perspiring. \"Make a choice now and tonight, Momma. We have to reinforce these busted-out windows, get you and Ayana in a safe room down the hall in a guest suite, and, because Carlos is injured, we can\u0027t just whisk things in here. We have to do it the old-fashioned way . . . lean on the Covenant to have construction crews in here, drop off groceries and ammo, along with clothes for you and the baby.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t choose this,\" her mother whispered.\\n\\n \"You think any of these people here did? Look around. You think anybody in here is having fun tonight? Poor Dan\u0027s got a mom and dad outside of here. My brother-that\u0027s right, I saidbrother, because he is . . . white, Jewish, and all, he\u0027s my brother, my team tight-he\u0027s worried about his people, this I know. It\u0027s a privilege to be here, Momma. Everybody\u0027s parents ain\u0027t so lucky.\" Inez glanced at Dan. \"I\u0027m sorry I rubbed a sore spot, but she gotta know the truth.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m good, Inez. Thanks,\" Dan said, his eyes holding hers with a private bond. \"When we took Father Pat in, I told Rabbi Zeitloff how worried we all were . . . they sent a team to scoop them, to bring them in till this blows over.\"\\n\\n \"They coming in, Danny boy?\" Berkfield asked. \"We can make room. You\u0027re the only other kid on this team that\u0027s got parents alive, and I\u0027d hate to see anybody have to go through a funeral caused by the darkside.\"\\n\\n Dan shook his head. \"They think that they\u0027re being put in temporary protective custody because of my supposed job in White House security.\" He smiled a sad smile. \"GeneralRivera saying that I worked high up will give Mom bragging rights. They have her and Dad secured and prayer-barriered in the equivalent of the Ritz-Carlton, so they\u0027ll be fine.\"\\n\\n \"Well as long as they\u0027re cool with it, and you\u0027re cool with it, man,\" Jose said. \"But if you need to bring \u0027em home, let us know. We allfam , and I\u0027ve lost my moms . . . so I know.\"\\n\\n \"This is my point,\" Inez said in a gentler tone, staring at her mother. \"No one here chose for this to be their life. Every person you see here came in here, just like you, Mom. They were chased into this family . . . scared, alone, seeing things that made them think they were crazy. Leaving the life they knew. Leaving normalcy, whatever that is. Leaving dreams, sometimes, and having to come up with new ones here because the old ones just didn\u0027t fit anymore. Lord knows, my best friend and team sister, Damali, did . . . you wanna hear a tale of woe, talk toher . Then you go sit with Carlos, and if that brother\u0027s stories don\u0027t turn your hair white, I don\u0027t know what will. He lostall his people.All of \u0027em, Mom.\"\\n\\n \"Damn sure did,\" Marlene muttered. \"When you come to sit with me, I got some for you, too . . . and can bring them with images and sound effects. Huh . . . don\u0027t get me started.\"\\n\\n Inez nodded. \"So you\u0027re gonna have to learn to fit into a new reality, gonna have to learn to fight, pray from that real place down in your soul-not just for show-carry a weapon, and learn protocols to keep you and the baby safe from demon attacks. . . .\" Inez let out a weary breath. \"There\u0027s so much that I can\u0027t evenbegin to go over it all in one night.\"\\n\\n \"Demon what?\" her mother whispered in a squeak.\\n\\n \"Yeah, ma\u0027am, like not opening the window for vampires, and such. I\u0027m with Shabazz,\" Rider said, rubbing his palms down his face. \"Starting tomorrow, you go through basics because we cannot have you mess around and accidentally get a team member hurt or killed. That cannot happen again.\" He looked atTara . \"Maybe you seers can help speed up her and Val\u0027s process. Justdo a mind dump and then we can run \u0027em through ammo skills. My patience is real short right now, but the knowledge needs to get embedded stat.\"\\n\\n Taranodded her chin toward Valkyrie who had remained silent, just watching the fray. \"Val, welcome, too. You don\u0027t need formal combat training, as you fight like a true seasoned warrior. I\u0027d be proud to have you on my flank.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" Val said, crossing her forearm over her chest.\\n\\n \"But we\u0027re gonna have to get you up to speed on new weapon technology, how this house is wired, and do some heavy cultural immersion so you don\u0027t sound so much like a foreigner.\"\\n\\n \"I stand at the ready,\" Val said. \"I stand with great pride.\"\\n\\n \"Cool. Then I\u0027ll get her phony docs,\" Dan said, \"everything from birth certificate to passport, so she can travel with us.New identity.\"\\n\\n \"You da man,\" Shabazz said, giving Dan a nod.\\n\\n \"Me, J.L., and Dan, with some wizard help from Bobby, can get the windows blue-energy wired hot till the Covenant crews get here to replace them in the morning.\" Shabazz looked around. \"Better tell them that this room got jacked up, too, J.L.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m on it,\" J.L. said. \"I\u0027m also up with Phat G-he told me about some new photo technology they had up in the Big Apple, so I can add that to our security cameras.\"\\n\\n \"Like \u0027Bazz said,\" Juanita threw in, \"you da man.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" Marlene finally interjected in a weary tone. \"Everybody needs a hot white bath, needs some rest. \u0027Nez, just tell your mom how to bathe herself and the baby for security, and I\u0027ll explain why to her later. One of you ladiesget Val square and in a room with bath stuff. We\u0027ll just have to pray they don\u0027t come at us again tonight. But you can rest assured they won\u0027t, because the house is tight.\"\\n\\n \"Val, I\u0027ll help you,\" Jasmine offered with a smile. \"You might also want to tag your weapons on your dresser, so you can find them in the morning.\"\\n\\n \"Bless you,\" Val said, and bowed.\\n\\n \"But that thing just came in, plus the panther,\" Mrs. Filgueiras gasped. She looked around clutching her heart.\\n\\n \"Jaguar,\" Shabazz muttered. \"And I was on your side. Don\u0027t forget that.\"\\n\\n Inez\u0027s mother looked at Shabazz and then her daughter. \"Then, then, the snake . . .\"\\n\\n \"It came in with Berkfield, because it was embedded down deep in Carlos\u0027s system, and Berkfield unknowingly pulled it up and out into him, ma\u0027am,\" J.L. said. \"Otherwise, the way we\u0027ve got security systems locked andloaded, a hostile fly can\u0027t come through here undetected without getting fried. If our alarms sound, you head for your daughter and Mike, and they\u0027ll tell you where to hunker down with the baby-until we can get you acclimated to defense protocols.\"\\n\\n Delores shook her head. \"Meand Ayana aren\u0027t sleeping in some room alone. We\u0027re all gonna be together.\"\\n\\n Mike looked down at his boots. \"That\u0027s no problem, ma\u0027am . . . until you all feel safe.All right?\"\\n\\n Inez simply nodded and looked away.\\n\\n \"Nope,\" Marlene said, placing her hands on her hips. \"Not all right.\"\\n\\n All eyes went to Marlene, especially Mrs. Filgueiras\u0027s.\\n\\n \"Here\u0027s my problem with this on many, many levels, Delores,\" Marlene said flatly. \"While this looks like something out ofMTV Cribs, this is a barracks. Number one, you are eventually going to have to pull your own weight in here. Crying, running around wringing your hands, and otherwise being hysterical won\u0027t cut it. Two, the baby is going to have to learn her limits real quick-even at her age, because we\u0027ve got ammo in here and all sorts of child-unfriendly hazmats. Third, you have to learn the basics, because God forbid, one day your daughter and Mike aren\u0027t around, just like that morning when a vamp crashed in on Ayana, you\u0027re going to have to know what to do. Then there\u0027s the not-so-small issue of rest for two soldiers. Mike and Inez are beyond exhausted. They are critical members of this Guardian team. If my big audio is off, or one of my seers can\u0027t see because she\u0027s fried, then that puts the team at risk.\"\\n\\n Marlene strode away from where she\u0027d been standing to come closer to Delores. She looked her dead in the eyes and didn\u0027t blink and didn\u0027t stutter.\\n\\n \"Woman to woman, mother of a grown daughter to mother of a grown daughter, last but not least is this-your daughter ismarried . If we go by biblical law, since you\u0027re an aficionado of Scripture, herhusband comes first, just like your daughter, hiswife comes first . . . yeah, beforeall others, it says. So hell no, I\u0027m not allowing you to be in their room after they just came out of a harrowing, traumatic battle, keeping them up all night, bitching, crying, and feeling sorry for yourself. Not having it. Mike and Inez need a married couple\u0027s space. End of story.\"\\n\\n Marlene walked away,then stopped as though someone had slapped her, and she cocked her head to the side.\\n\\n \"And, no,\" Marlene said, fury in her expression as she turned to stare at Delores. \"Don\u0027t even beginthat guilt trip. This ain\u0027t about the baby; it\u0027s about what your stubborn ass wants. The baby is not suddenly going to start sleeping with them, either, giving you a reason to be running into their room or their business at will. Before you showed up, we had peace in this house. It\u0027s gonna stay that way, trust me. I have second-sight like you wouldn\u0027t believe, sis-plus a whole lotta hard-earned wisdom to go along with it . . . therefore, I can and will say stuff to you that your daughter just can\u0027t bring herself to say and that Mike is too much of a sweetheart and a gentleman to say. But see, I gave up being a lady a long time ago-and I will ride your ass like a cowboy if you start some shit up in here.\"\\n\\n Marlene folded her arms. Delores angrily looked away.\\n\\n \"The baby is going to bed at regular hours-starting at eightP.M. so the child is on a schedule and isn\u0027t cranky. At three years old, yes shewill take a nap during the day, too. In addition to your basic boot-camp information drills, you and Val will be added to the house chore schedule. Everybody in here pulls their weight. You\u0027re also going to get a rude wake-up call in the kitchen. We only do the heavy meal, heavy fat thing forreal special occasions, because we\u0027re not trying to have warriors in the streets coping with diabetes, heart disease, cancer, you name it. So we do healthy. And we don\u0027t do subversive. Everybody here works in harmony-we\u0027ve already had our trials with that, and I\u0027ll turn your ass out into the street and let the werewolves feed on you before we go through that again . . . this way, it won\u0027t be on your daughter\u0027s conscience-and I can live with it.\"\\n\\n Shabazz landed a hand on Marlene\u0027s shoulder and then kissed her cheek, chuckling. \"Retract the canines and the claws, baby. Damn, if I was bad cop, you\u0027re RoboCop.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t care what anyone on the Neteru Councils of Kings andQueens said,she wasn\u0027t moving any more than an inch or two from Carlos\u0027s body. Damali leaned down and kissed his forehead again and held his hand tightly while Eve and Aset laid hands on the sites of his wounds.\\n\\n As Aset and Eve carefully stripped away his ragged T-shirt and cut away Carlos\u0027s bloodied jeans, she could see how thoroughly angry, bloodied, blue-black welts covered the entire front of his torso. Places that weren\u0027t the dark-stained hue of bruised blood trapped beneath skin had a yellowish-greenish tinge. She hurt for him; what he must have endured brought fresh tears to her eyes. When Aset gently lifted another strip of fabric away, that\u0027s when she saw a rib move in an unnatural way beneath his skin. Yet they worked without ceasing, cleaning him off as they laid strips of delicate linen across his groin.\\n\\n Surrounded by opalescent alabaster walls that throbbed with pulsing white-light energy, they had brought him to what could only be described as a Kemetian ER. Hieroglyphics of Ausar\u0027s conquering death with the help of his wife, Aset, frescoed the ceiling. Damali tried to steady her breathing. The Neteru energy was so all-pervasive that she felt disoriented by it, almost woozy.\\n\\n Silver and alabaster canopic jars delicately decorated with colored faience and carnelian made her nervous, though. She knew what those were for. In the days of mummification . . . Damali briefly closed her eyes and disallowed herself to even think it.\\n\\n Light was everywhere. Adam and Ausar stood at the ready to lend an infusion of necessary, balancing male energy. One carried the ceremonial Pharaoh\u0027s crook made of gold, while the other grasped the traditional flail-their stance symbolic of the joining of upper and lower Kemet, the Smai Tawi, the Great that could not be divided, just as Carlos\u0027s spirit could not be divided, from his mind, nor his body.\\n\\n The male Neteru Kings had spoken through theBook of Coming Forth by Day , Ausar\u0027s original copy of thePert M Heru M Gher, and had renounced Set, then placed the all-seeing eye on the long white marble table above Carlos\u0027s crown chakra and the feather of Ma\u0027at at his feet. But this delicate work of healing the spirit remained in the province of women. The Caduceus had rendered futile results, and that terrified her.\\n\\n \"Neith, Selkis, Nephthys, Isis,\"Eve murmured. \"From the sacredAmduat I call theshabti of life and Light, those who labor for the Pharaoh in the Light in the afterlife to bring forth healing, to convert pain into knowledge, heartbreak into joy, destruction into creation . . . where life is ebbing, let it flow. Where the moon of his breath is waning, let it wax.\"\\n\\n Aset breathed out a slow breath, opening her hands to form a glistening amethyst ray of light between them. She stood on one side of Carlos, left palm up, right palm down. Eve mirrored Aset, standing across from her with left palm down, right palm up, pulling the light across him in a wide band that they slowly brought down the length of his body as though giving him an MRI.\\n\\n Perspiration beaded on Aset\u0027s regal forehead, her golden robes beginning to cling to her flawless, cinnamon-hued body. Eve\u0027s moss-green robe darkened with moisture against her ebony skin as they worked in tandem.\\n\\n \"Damali,\" Aset finally murmured. \"Your mother\u0027s line is that of Powers angels-this we now know. Your father carried the Neteru gene. You must join us . . . you are Carlos\u0027s wife. From here, your prayers and energy will be heard throughout the realms.\"\\n\\n Damali stood where Adam indicated, at Carlos\u0027s head. As soon as she joined hands with Aset and Eve, creating a physical pyramid around him, a gentle, healing green glow spilled from her heart into the center of their outstretched arms. Slowly and carefully, Aset led the movement down Carlos\u0027s body, forcing Damali to step around the table and walk with her and Eve.\\n\\n Aset finally released Damali\u0027s hands and then looked at Ausar. He simply nodded with Adam, and both male Neteru Kings stepped forward and placeda silver Eye of Heru on Carlos\u0027s forehead and the feather of Ma\u0027at over his heart. They took up his hands and gently placed the crook and staff within his grip, folding his arms over his chest.\\n\\n \"The judgment is up to the All,\" Aset said quietly, drawing Damali away from Carlos\u0027s side. \"Whatever is decided for your Pharaoh, you must accept it, and rule on in dignity and honor.\"\\n\\n Damali clutched Aset\u0027s hand and stared at her, blinking back tears. \"I don\u0027t understand what happened to him . . . why this time . . .\"\\n\\n \"The attack stripped away the Neteru fortificationinside his body,\" Eve said quietly, touching Damali\u0027s cheek. \"Outwardly, he was still Neteru . . . but inwardly, he was becoming more and more human . . . more normal mortal, the more the hate festered. And he sustained mortal injuries, beloved daughter. His Guardian brother took some of the brunt, and the healing serpents of the Caduceus tried to chase out the poison, but the healing of his body took so long. We just do not know the outcome, and have called upon the Divine Creator, Neter, and all the angels, even by their ancient Kemetian names.\"\\n\\n Tears filled Aset\u0027s eyes. \"This was not supposed to be that young king\u0027s path,\" she said in a harsh whisper, suddenly hugging Damali.\\n\\n Damali pulled away. \"You\u0027ve given up, haven\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n Eve shook her head. \"We have called theSunnutu . . . the divine physicians, and Imhotep, the physician-healer to whom the Caduceus first belonged. Even as his breath expires, we will labor in spirit to fight this tragedy.\"\\n\\n \"We continue to pray forSeneb -his health, soundness, and wellness, from theMetu Neter, \" Aset said quietly. \"But he may experienceKhepera . . . ultimate transformation, daughter.\"\\n\\n \"No . . .\" Damali whispered. \"He already died and came back to me from the darkness into the Light. That is not hisshai .\"\\n\\n \"None of us believe it is his destiny,\" Ausar said, his regal Pharaoh robes billowing as he came to Damali\u0027s side with Adam. \"I, of all Neterus, believe in resurrection, even after battling Set-the wicked one.\"\\n\\n \"But we have prepared Carlos\u0027s body,\" Adam murmured, touching Damali\u0027s shoulder. \"Just in case . . . if what is in his heart is not the weight of the feather of Ma\u0027at or lighter, her scales will not balance and his Ka-his soul-and his Ba-his heart soul, which dwells in the Ka and has the power of transformation-cannot reunite with his Khu-his spiritual soul. He has been scattered within. Before, when Set, also known by many other names, attacked Ausar, he\u0027d scattered his body. This is why Aset could find those pieces and heal the physical. But in time Set learned that the body matters not; to kill a man forever, scatter his spirit. Thus the body dies, energy imploding as the soul flees its shell. At this moment, Carlos\u0027s organs are healed . . . but there is much more involved.\"\\n\\n \"If I had gotten to him sooner,\" Damali whispered, hugging herself. \"I should have never left him, even for a moment to secure the teams.\"\\n\\n \"You could not properly heal his body while on the earth plane,\" Aset said sadly. \"Until we purged you of the taint Carlos had, you could only minimally reverse the damage. This was the one time when the one-flesh marital rule worked against you. Even as a Power, your Guardian brother, the healer Berkfield, could do more than you could. The taint from the Unnamed is truly unfathomable.\"\\n\\n Damali looked over at Carlos\u0027s body, which had been prepared for the possibility of burial. Tightness filled her chest, a dread so profound that it stole her breath. She moved to him in mechanical, jerky steps, unbelieving. They had given him the all-seeing eye, so that he would not be blinded to the truth or his enemies on the other side. They had put the regal staff and crook in his grip, that he might walk into the Neteru Kings\u0027 Council already bearing the symbols of office . . . and they had left Ma\u0027at\u0027s feather so his heart could judge him. But that was the place that the Darkness had attacked.\\n\\n More fine linen was waiting to wrap him. Damali shook her head and gently cradled Carlos\u0027s head between her palms. Drawing on all the love within her, she murmured into his ear, \"Say it in your mind, baby . . .Rex a em Ab a sekhem a em hati a . . . I know my heart, I have gained power over my heart.Ba ar pet sat ar ta . . . soul is of heaven, body belongs to the earth. Carlos, are you ready to depart this earth? Are you ready to leave me? Say it!Un na uat neb am pet am ta . . . tell Ma\u0027at as she weighs your heart that the power is within you to open all doors to heaven and earth-because youare a millennium Neteru and you\u0027ve got work to do,\" Damali urged, beginning to sob.\\n\\n \"Tell her you were already baptized by the fire, and came back in the water-Father Pat took you to the water and opened your heart to a second chance that can never be taken back . . .Sekhem a em mu ma aua Set -I have gained power in the water as I conquered Set. Put this man in the spiritual water, Ma\u0027at, put his heart there so that it\u0027s weightless! He was even born a water sign . . . give him a spiritual bath that he may gain power in the water and conquer this thing that has a stranglehold on his heart,\"\\n\\n She rested her head on his forehead, trembling, her voice becoming a fragile whisper. \"Please, baby, do it for me, Carlos. Cast that demon out of your heart and come back to me tonight.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-darkness-vampire-huntress-legend-10/page-12.html","bookId":2534,"book":{"id":2534,"title":"The Darkness (Vampire Huntress Legend #10)","description":"Storyline: The Darkness (Vampire Huntress Legend #10) \\n After the battle at Masada, the Neteru team returns to San Diego believing forty-thousand demons had been eradicated and that Lilith\u0027s spawn has been killed.
