You were moments away from seeing me the victor.”\\n\\n Alistair elbowed him in the ribs. “If Tarley had not spared you, you would be pleading for mercy now.”\\n\\n “Ho! Shall we determine the winner with a race to the—”\\n\\n Alistair was running before the last word was out.\\n\\n Within hours, she would be wed.\\n\\n As the dark of night lightened into the gray of predawn, Jessica hugged her shawl tighter about her shoulders and walked Temperance deeper into the forest surrounding the Pennington manse. The pug’s rapid steps crunched atop the loose gravel trail in a staccato that was soothing in its familiarity.\\n\\n “Why must you be so picky?” Jess chastised. Her breath puffed visibly in the chill air, making her long for the warmth of the bed she had yet to crawl into. “Any spot should suffice.”\\n\\n Temperance glanced up with an expression Jess swore was akin to exasperation.\\n\\n “Very well,” she said reluctantly, unable to refuse that look. “We’ll go a bit farther.”\\n\\n They rounded a corner and Temperance paused, sniffing. Apparently satisfied with the location, the pug presented her back to Jess and squatted in front of a tree.\\n\\n Smiling at the bid for privacy, Jess turned away and took in her surroundings, deciding to explore the trail more thoroughly in the light of day. Unlike so many estates where the gardens and woodlands were invaded by obelisks, reproductions of Grecian statues and temples, and the occasional pagoda, the Pennington estate displayed a welcome appreciation of the natural landscape. There were places along the pathway where it felt as if civilization and all its inhabitants were miles away. She had not expected to enjoy the feeling so much but found she did, especially after hours of meaningless interactions with people who cared only for the title she was marrying into.\\n\\n “I shall enjoy walking you through here,” she said over her shoulder, “when the sun is up and I am properly attired for the activity.”\\n\\n Temperance finished her business and moved into view. The pug started back toward the house, tugging on the leash with notable impatience after taking so long to find a proper piddle spot. Jess was following when a rustling noise to the left put Temperance on alert. The dog’s dark ears and tail perked up, while her tan muscular body tensed with expectation.\\n\\n Jess’s heart beat faster. If it was a wild boar or feral fox, the situation would be disastrous. She would be devastated if something untoward happened to Temperance, who was the only creature on earth who did not judge Jess by standards she struggled greatly to meet.\\n\\n A squirrel darted across the path. Jess melted with relief and gave a breathless laugh. But Temperance did not stand down. The pug lunged, ripping her leash from Jess’s slackened grip.\\n\\n “Bloody hell. Temperance!”\\n\\n In a flash of tiny limbs and fur, the two creatures were gone. The sounds of the chase—the rustling of leaves and the pug’s low growling—quickly faded.\\n\\n Tossing up her hands, Jess left the walkway and followed the path of trampled foliage. She was so focused on tracking, she failed to realize she’d come upon a large gazebo until she very nearly ran into it. She veered to the right …\\n\\n A female’s throaty laugh broke the quiet. Jess stumbled to a startled halt.\\n\\n “Hurry, Lucius,” the woman urged breathlessly. “Trent will note my absence.”\\n\\n Wilhelmina, Lady Trent. Jess stood unmoving, barely breathing.\\n\\n There was a slow, drawn-out creaking of wood.\\n\\n “Patience, darling.” A recognizable masculine voice rejoined in a lazy, practiced drawl. “Let me give you what you paid for.”\\n\\n The gazebo creaked again, louder this time. Quicker and harder. Lady Trent gave a thready moan.\\n\\n Alistair Lucius Caulfield. Inflagrente delicto with the Countess of Trent. Dear God. The woman was nearly a score of years his senior. Beautiful, yes, but of an age with his mother.\\n\\n The use of his middle name was startling. And, perhaps, telling … ? Aside from the obvious, perhaps they were intimate in a deeper sense. Was it possible the roguish Caulfield had a tendre for the lovely countess, enough that she would have reason to call him by a name not used by others?\\n\\n “You,” the countess purred, “are worth every shilling I pay for you.”\\n\\n Dear God. Perhaps not an intimacy at all, but a … transaction. An arrangement. With a man providing the services …\\n\\n Hoping to move on without giving herself away, Jess took a tentative step forward. A slight movement in the gazebo prompted her to still again. Her eyes narrowed, struggling to overcome the insufficient light. It was her misfortune to be bathed in the faint glow of the waning moon while the interior of the gazebo remained deeply shadowed by its roof and overhanging trees.\\n\\n She saw a hand wrapped around one of the domed roof’s supporting poles and another set a short ways above it. A man’s hands, gripping for purchase. From their height on the beam, she knew he was standing.\\n\\n “Lucius … For God’s sake, don’t stop now.”\\n\\n Lady Trent was pinned between Caulfield and the wood. Which meant he was facing Jess.\\n\\n Twin glimmers in the darkness betrayed a blink.\\n\\n He saw her. Was in fact staring at her.\\n\\n Jess wished the ground would open and swallow her whole. What was she to say? How was one supposed to act when caught in such a situation?\\n\\n “Lucius! Damn you.” The weathered wood whined in response to its pressures. “The feel of your big cock in me is delicious, but far more so when it’s moving.”\\n\\n Jess’s hand went to her throat. Despite the cold, perspiration misted her forehead. The horror she should have felt at finding a man engaged in sexual congress was markedly absent. Because it was Caulfield, and he fascinated her. It was a terrible sort of captivation with which she viewed him—a mixture of envy for his freedom and horror at the ease with which he disregarded public opinion.\\n\\n She had to get away before she was forced to acknowledge her presence to Lady Trent. She took a careful step forward …\\n\\n “Wait.” Caulfield’s voice was gruffer than before.\\n\\n She froze.\\n\\n “I cannot!” Lady Trent protested breathlessly.\\n\\n But it was not the countess Caulfield spoke to.\\n\\n One of his hands was outstretched, extended toward Jess. The request stunned her into immobility.\\n\\n A long moment passed in which her gaze remained fixed on the twin sparkles of his eyes. His breathing became harsh and audible.\\n\\n Then, he gripped the pole again and began to move.\\n\\n His thrusts began slowly at first, then became more fervent with a building tempo. The rhythmic protests of the wood battered Jess from all sides. She could see no detail beyond those two hands and glistening gaze that smoldered with a tangible heat, but the sounds she heard filled her mind with images. Caulfield never took his eyes from her, even as he rutted so furiously she wondered how the countess could take pleasure in such violence of movement. Lady Trent was nearly incoherent, coarse words of praise spilling from her lips between high-pitched squeals.\\n\\n Jess was riveted by this exposure to a side of sexual congress she’d been mostly ignorant of. She knew the mechanics; her stepmother had been most thorough. Do not cringe or cry when he enters you. Try to relax; it will decrease the discomfort. Make no sound of any kind. Never voice a complaint. And yet Jess had seen the knowing looks of other women and heard whispers behind fans that hinted at more. Now she had the proof. Every pleasured sound Lady Trent made echoed through her, tripping over her senses like a stone skipping over water. Her body responded instinctively—her skin became sensitive and her breathing came in quick pants.\\n\\n She began to quiver under the weight of Caulfield’s gaze. Although she longed to run from the purloined intimacy, she was unable to move. It was impossible, but it seemed as if he looked right through her, past the façade forged by her father’s hand.\\n\\n The bonds holding her in place broke only when Caulfield did. His serrated groan at the moment of crisis acted like a spur to her flank. She ran then, clinging to her shawl with both arms crossed over full and aching breasts. When Temperance dashed out of a bush to greet her, Jess sobbed with relief. Scooping up the pug, she rushed toward the trail leading back to the manse.\\n\\n “Lady Jessica!”\\n\\n The calling of her name as Jess returned to the relative safety of the rear garden caused her to stumble. Her heart raced anew at being caught. She spun in a flurry of pale blue satin skirts, searching for the caller and mortified at the thought it might be Alistair Caulfield with a plea for discretion. Or worse, her father.\\n\\n “Jessica. By God, I’ve been searching all over for you.”\\n\\n She was relieved to see Benedict approaching from the direction of the house, but relief bled into wariness. He maneuvered through the yew-lined garden paths with such a brisk, determined stride. A shiver moved through her. Was he angry?\\n\\n “Is something amiss?” she queried carefully as he neared, knowing it must be to cause him to seek her out at this hour.\\n\\n “You have been gone at length. Half an hour ago, your abigail said you’d left to walk Temperance, and you had already been absent for a quarter hour when I inquired.”\\n\\n Her gaze lowered to avoid any appearance of challenge. “I apologize for causing you concern.”\\n\\n “No need for apologies,” he said in a clipped tone. “I simply wished to have a word with you. We are to be wed today, and I wanted to allay any nerves that might plague you before the event.”\\n\\n Jess blinked and looked up, startled by his consideration. “My lord—”\\n\\n “Benedict,” he corrected, catching up her hand. “You are chilled to the bone. Where have you been?”\\n\\n The concern in his tone was unmistakable. She wasn’t certain at first how to respond. His reaction was so different from the one her father would have had.\\n\\n Thrown off guard by her own confusion, she began to reply almost without thinking. As she relayed the tale of Temperance leading her on a merry chase after a squirrel, Jess studied her future spouse with more care than she’d invested in a very long time. He had become a staple in her life, an obligation she accepted without need for deep contemplation. Inasmuch as she was able, she had grown comfortable with the inevitability of sharing a life with him. But she did not feel comfortable now. She remained flushed and agitated by the way Caulfield had used her to further his own pleasure.\\n\\n “I would have walked with you, if you had asked,” Benedict said when she finished. He gave her hand a squeeze. “In the future, I pray you do so.”\\n\\n Emboldened by his gentle manner and the lingering effects of the wine she’d drunk too liberally of at supper, Jess pressed on recklessly. “Temperance and I found something else in the woods.”\\n\\n “Oh?”\\n\\n She told him about the couple in the gazebo, her voice low and faltering, her words tumbling over themselves because she lacked the vocabulary and confidence. She did not speak of the coin exchanged between the countess and Caulfield, nor did she divulge their identities.\\n\\n Benedict didn’t move the entirety of the short time she spoke. When she finished, he cleared his throat and said, “Damnation, I am horrified that you were exposed to such unpleasantness on the eve of our wedding.”\\n\\n “They did not seem to find the encounter unpleasant at all.”\\n\\n He flushed. “Jessica—”\\n\\n “You spoke of allaying my nerves,” she said quickly, before losing her courage. “I should like to be honest with you, but I fear overstepping the limits of your forbearance.”\\n\\n “I will advise you if that limit is reached.”\\n\\n “In what manner?”\\n\\n “Beg your pardon?” Benedict frowned.\\n\\n Jess swallowed. “In what manner will you advise me? With a word? A loss of privilege? S-something more … definitive?”\\n\\n He stiffened. “I would never lay a hand to you or any woman; I would certainly never fault you for honesty. I expect I will be far more lenient with you than with anyone else of my acquaintance. You are a great prize to me, Jessica. I have waited impatiently for the day when you would be mine.”\\n\\n “Why?”\\n\\n “You are a beautiful woman,” he said gruffly. Astonishment swept through her, followed by a rush of unexpected hope. “My lord, would you be displeased to know that I find myself praying for the physical aspect of our marriage to be … pleasurable? For both of us.”\\n\\n God knew she would not be able to dally as Lady Trent did. Such behavior was not in her nature.\\n\\n He displayed his unease with the topic by pulling at the elegant knot of his cravat. “I have always intended to make it so. I will make it so, if you trust me.”\\n\\n “Benedict.” She inhaled the scent clinging to him—spice, tobacco, and a fine port. Despite wading through a discussion he would certainly never expect to have with his lady wife, his responses were as direct as his gaze. She liked him more each moment that passed. “You are taking this conversation so well. I cannot help wondering how far I can press you.”\\n\\n “Please, speak freely,” he urged. “I want you to come to the altar with no doubts or reservations.”\\n\\n Jess spoke in a rush. “I should like to retire with you to the summerhouse by the lake. This moment.”\\n\\n His exhale was harsh, as were his features. His grip on her hand tightened almost painfully. “Why?”\\n\\n “I have angered you.” Averting her gaze, she backed away. “Forgive me. And pray, do not doubt my innocence. The hour is late and I am not myself.”\\n\\n Benedict pulled her hand to his chest, bringing her close again. “Look at me, Jessica.”\\n\\n She did as he asked and was made dizzy by his regard. He no longer looked at her with discomfort or concern.\\n\\n “We are mere hours away from the marriage bed,” he reminded her in a voice hoarser than she’d ever heard it. “I collect that the events you witnessed in the woods stirred reactions you do not yet understand, and I cannot tell you how it affects me to learn you are fascinated by your response and not repulsed, as some women might be. But you are to be my wife and you deserve the respect of that station.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/seven-years-to-sin-historical-1/page-2.html","bookId":2663,"book":{"id":2663,"title":"Seven Years to Sin (Historical #1)","description":"Storyline: Seven Years to Sin (Historical #1) \\n The longer the resistance… \\n Seven years ago, on the eve of her wedding, proper Lady Jessica Sheffield witnessed a licentious scene no innocent young miss could imagine.
