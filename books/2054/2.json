Around here, however, that amount of light could have indicated anything from sunrise to high noon. After four rings, I finally deigned to answer, accidentally knocking Aubrey out of the bed. She landed with an indignant mhew and stalked off to clean herself.\n \"Hello?\"\n \" Yo, Kincaid?\"\n \"No.\" My response came swift and certain. \"I\u0027m not coming in.\"\n \"You don\u0027t even know I\u0027m going to ask that.\"\n \"Of course I know. There\u0027s no other reason you\u0027d be calling me this early, and I\u0027m not going to do it. It\u0027s my day off, Doug.\"\n Doug, the other assistant manager at my day job, was a pretty nice guy, but he couldn\u0027t keep a poker face - or voice - to save his life. His cool demeanor immediately gave way to desperation. \"Everyone called in sick today, and now we\u0027re strapped. You have to do it.\"\n \"Well, I\u0027m sick too. Believe me, you don\u0027t want me there.\"\n Okay, I wasn\u0027t exactly sick, but I was still sporting a residual afterglow from being with Martin. Mortals would not \"see\" it as Duane had per se, but they would sense it and be drawn to it - men and women alike - without even knowing why. My confinement today would prevent any foolish, lovesick behavior. It was very kind of me, really.\n \"Liar. You\u0027re never sick.\"\n \"Doug, I was already planning on coming back tonight for the signing. If I work a shift today too, I\u0027ll be there all day. That\u0027s sick and twisted.\"\n \"Welcome to my world, babe. We have no alternative, not if you really care about the fate of the store, not if you truly care about our customers and their happiness...\"\n \"You\u0027re losing me, cowboy.\"\n \"So,\" he continued, \"the question is, are you going to come here willingly, or do I have to walk over there and drag you out of bed myself? Frankly, I wouldn\u0027t mind the latter.\"\n I did a mental eye roll, chiding myself for the billionth time about living two blocks from work. His rambling about the bookstore\u0027s suffering had been effective, as he\u0027d known it would. I operated under the mistaken belief that the place couldn\u0027t survive without me.\n \"Well, rather than risk any more of your attempts at witty, sexual banter, I suppose I\u0027ll have to come over there. But Doug...\" My voice turned hard.\n \"Yeah?\"\n \"Don\u0027t put me on the registers or anything.\"\n I heard hesitation on his end.\n \"Doug? I\u0027m serious. Not the main registers. I don\u0027t want to be around a lot of customers.\"\n \"All right,\" he said at last. \"Not the main registers.\"\n \"Promise?\"\n \"I promise.\"\n A half hour later, I stepped outside my door to walk the two blocks to the bookstore. Long clouds hung low, darkening the sky, and a faint chill touched the air, forcing some of my fellow pedestrians to don a coat. I had opted for none, finding my khaki slacks and brown chenille sweater more than sufficient. The clothing, just like the lip gloss and eyeliner I\u0027d carefully applied this morning, were real; I had not shape-shifted into them. I enjoyed the routine nature of applying cosmetics and matching articles of clothing, though Hugh would have claimed I was just being weird again.\n Emerald City Books \u0026 Caf¨¦ was a sprawling establishment, occupying almost a full block in Seattle\u0027s Queen Anne neighborhood. It sat two stories high, with the cafe portion dominating a second-floor corner viewing the Space Needle. A cheerful green awning hung over the main door, protecting those customers waiting for the store to open. I walked around them and entered through a side door, using my staff key.\n Doug assaulted me before I\u0027d taken two steps inside. \"It\u0027s about time. We...\" He paused and did a double-take, reexamining me. \"Wow. You look... really nice today. Did you do something different?\"\n Only a thirty-four-year-old virgin, I thought.\n \"You\u0027re just imagining things because you\u0027re so happy I\u0027m here to fix your staffing problem. What am I doing? Stock?\"\n \"I, er, no.\" Doug struggled to snap out of his haze, still looking me up and down in a way I found disconcerting. His interest in dating me was no secret, nor was my continual rejection. \"Come on, I\u0027ll show you.\"\n \"I told you - \"\n \"It\u0027s not the main registers,\" he promised me.\n What \"it\" turned out to be was the espresso counter in our upstairs cafe. Bookstore staff hardly ever subbed up here, but it wasn\u0027t unheard of.\n Bruce, the cafe manager, popped up from where he\u0027d been kneeling behind the counter. I often thought Doug and Bruce could be twins in a mixed-race, alternate-reality sort of way. Both had long, scraggly ponytails, and both wore a good deal of flannel in tribute to the grunge era neither had fully recovered from. They differed mainly in their coloring. Doug was Japanese-American, black-haired with flawless skin; Bruce was Mr. Aryan Nation, all blond hair and blue eyes.\n \"Hey Doug, Georgina,\" heralded Bruce. His eyes widened at me. \"Whoa, you look great today.\"\n \"Doug! This is just as bad. I told you I didn\u0027t want any customers.\"\n \"You told me not the main registers. You didn\u0027t say anything about this one.\"\n I opened my mouth to protest, but Bruce interrupted. \"Come on, Georgina, I had Alex call in sick today, and Cindy actually quit.\" Seeing my stony expression, he quickly added, \"Our registers are almost identical to yours. It\u0027ll be easy.\"\n \"Besides\" - Doug raised his voice to a fair imitation of our manager\u0027s - \" \u0027assistant managers are supposed to be able to fill in for anybody around here.\u0027 \"\n \"Yeah, but the cafe - \"\n \" - is still part of the store. Look, I\u0027ve got to go open. Bruce\u0027ll show you what you need to know. Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027ll be fine.\" He hastily darted off before I could refuse again.\n \"Coward!\" I yelled after him.\n \"It really won\u0027t be that bad,\" Bruce reiterated, not understanding my dismay. \"You just take the money, and I\u0027ll make the espresso. Let\u0027s practice on you. You want a white chocolate mocha?\"\n \"Yeah,\" I conceded. Everyone I worked with knew about that particular vice. I usually managed to take down three of them a day. Mochas that was, not coworkers.\n Bruce walked me through the necessary steps, showing me how to mark up the cups and find what I needed to push on the register\u0027s touch-screen interface. He was right. It wasn\u0027t so bad.\n \"You\u0027re a natural,\" he assured me later, handing over my mocha.\n I grunted in response and consumed my caffeine, thinking I could handle anything so long as the mochas kept coming.\n Besides, this really couldn\u0027t be as bad as the main registers. The cafe probably did no business this time of day.\n I was wrong. Minutes after opening, we had a line of five people.\n \"Large latte,\" I repeated back to my first customer, carefully punching in the information.\n \"Already got it,\" Bruce told me, starting the beverage before I even had a chance to label the cup. I happily took the woman\u0027s money and moved on to my next order.\n \"A large skinny mocha.\"\n \" Skinny\u0027s just another word for nonfat, Georgina.\"\n I scrawled NF on the cup. No worries. We could do this.\n The next customer wandered up and stared at me, momentarily bedazzled. Coming to her senses, she shook her head and blurted out a torrent of orders.\n \"I need one small drip coffee, one large nonfat vanilla latte, one small double cappuccino, and one large decaf latte.\"\n Now I felt bedazzled. How had she remembered all those? And honestly, who ordered drip anymore?\n On and on the morning went, and despite my misgivings, I soon felt myself perking up and enjoying the experience. I couldn\u0027t help it. It was how I worked, how I carried myself through life. I liked trying new things - even something as banal as ringing up espresso. People could be silly, certainly, but I enjoyed working with the public most of the time. It was how I had ended up in customer service.\n And once I overcame my sleepiness, my inborn succubus charisma kicked in. I became the star of my own personal stage show, bantering and flirting with ease. When combined with the Martin-induced glamour, I became downright irresistible. While this did result in a number of proffered dates and pickup lines, it also saved me from the repercussions of any mistakes. My customers found no wrong with me.\n \"That\u0027s all right, dear,\" one older woman assured me upon discovering I\u0027d accidentally ordered her a large cinnamon mocha instead of a nonfat, decaf latte. \"I really need to branch out into new drinks anyway.\"\n I smiled back winningly, hoping she wasn\u0027t diabetic.\n Later on, a guy came up carrying a copy of Seth Mortensen\u0027s The Glasgow Pact. It was the first sign I\u0027d seen of tonight\u0027s momentous event.\n \"Are you going to the signing?\" I asked as I rang up his tea. Bleh. Caffeine-free.\n He studied me for a pregnant moment, and I braced myself for a pass.\n Instead the guy said mildly, \"Yeah, I\u0027ll be there.\"\n \"Well, make sure you think up good questions for him. Don\u0027t ask the same ones everyone else does.\"\n \"What do you mean?\"\n \"Oh, you know, the usual. \u0027Where do you get your ideas from?\u0027 and \u0027Are Cady and O\u0027Neill ever going to get together?\u0027 \"\n The guy considered this as I made change. He was cute, in a disheveled sort of way. He had brown hair with a reddish-gold gleam to it, said gleam being more noticeable in the shadow of facial hair crossing his lower face. I couldn\u0027t quite decide if he\u0027d intentionally grown a beard or just forgotten to shave. Whatever it was, it had grown in more or less evenly and, when combined with the Pink Floyd T-shirt he wore, presented the image of a sort of hippie-lumberjack.\n \"I don\u0027t think the \u0027usual questions\u0027 make them any less meaningful to the one doing the asking,\" he decided at last, seeming shy about contradicting me. \"To a fan, each question is new and unique.\"\n He stepped aside so I could wait on another customer. I continued the conversation as I took the next order, unwilling to pass up the opportunity to discuss Seth Mortensen intelligently.\n \"Forget the fans. What about poor Seth Mortensen? He probably wants to impale himself each time he gets one of those.\"\n \" \u0027Impale\u0027 is kind of a strong word, don\u0027t you think?\"\n \"Absolutely not. The guy\u0027s brilliant. Hearing idiotic questions must bore him to tears.\"\n A bemused smile played across the man\u0027s mouth, and his steady brown eyes weighed me carefully. When he realized he was staring so openly, he glanced away, embarrassed. \"No. If he\u0027s out touring, he cares about his fans. He doesn\u0027t mind the repetitive questions.\"\n \"He\u0027s not out touring for altruism. He\u0027s out touring because the publicists at his publishing house are making him tour,\" I countered. \"Which is also a waste of time, by the way.\"\n He dared a look back at me. \"Touring is? You don\u0027t want to meet him?\"\n \"I - well, yes, of course I do. It\u0027s just, that... okay. Look, don\u0027t get me wrong. I worship the ground this guy walks on. I\u0027m excited to meet him tonight. I\u0027m dying to meet him tonight. If he wanted to carry me off and make me his love slave, I\u0027d do it, so long as I got advance copies of his books. But this touring thing... it takes time. Time that would be better spent writing the next book. I mean, haven\u0027t you seen how long his books take to come out?\"\n \"Yeah. I\u0027ve noticed.\"\n Just then, a previous customer returned, complaining he\u0027d gotten caramel syrup instead of caramel sauce. Whatever that meant. I offered a few smiles and sweet apologies, and he soon didn\u0027t care about the caramel sauce or anything else. By the time he left my register, the Mortensen fan guy was gone too.\n When I finally finished my shift around five, Doug came to meet me.\n \"I heard some interesting things about your performance up here.\"\n \"I hear interesting things about your \u0027performance\u0027 all the time, Doug, but you don\u0027t hear me making jokes about it.\"\n He bandied with me a bit more and finally released me to get ready for the signing, but not before I\u0027d made him humbly acknowledge how much he owed me for my kindness today. Between him and Hugh, I was accruing favors all over the place.\n I practically ran the two blocks home, anxious to grab some dinner and figure out what I wanted to wear. My exhilaration was growing. In an hour or so, I\u0027d be meeting my all-time favorite author. Could life get any better? Humming to myself, I took the stairs two at a time and produced my keys with a flourish that only I noticed or appreciated.\n As I opened the door, a hand suddenly grabbed me and pulled me roughly inside, into the darkness of my apartment. I yelped in surprise and fear as I was shoved up against the door, slamming it shut. The lights burst on suddenly and unexpectedly, and the faint smell of sulfur wafted through the air. Although the brightness made me wince, I could see well enough to recognize what was going on.\n Hell hath no fury like a pissed-off demon. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/succubus-blues-georgina-kincaid-1/page-2.html","bookId":2054,"book":{"id":2054,"title":"Succubus Blues (Georgina Kincaid #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Georgina Kincaid Book 1: Succubus Blues \n We first meet Georgina Kincaid when she is asked by her friend Hugh the imp to sleep with a virgin who has bargained to give up his soul in exchange for a hot and heavy fantasy encounter with a demoness.
