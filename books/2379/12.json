I just wanted to apologize, all right? I’ve been trying to chase you down in school, but you keep running away from me.” “Well, it’s complicated, Hanna,” Sean said. Hanna was about to ask what was so complicated when Candace put her hands on both their shoulders. “I see you two know each other!” “That’s right,” Hanna chirped, momentarily burying her irritation. “We’re so happy to have you, Hanna.” Candace beamed. “You’d be a very positive role model for us.” “Thanks.” Hanna felt a little thrill. Even if it was V Club, she wasn’t often embraced like this. Not by her third-grade tennis coach, not by her friends, not by her teachers, certainly not by her parents. Perhaps V Club was her calling. She pictured herself as the spokeswoman of V Club. Maybe it was like being Miss America, except instead of a crown, she’d get a fabulous V Club ring. Or maybe a V Club bag. A cherry-monogrammed Louis Vuitton clutch with a hand-painted V. “So, do you think you’ll join us next week?” Candace asked. Hanna looked at Sean. “Probably.” “Wonderful!” Candace cried. She left Hanna and Sean alone again. Hanna sucked in her stomach, wishing she hadn’t hogged down a Good Humor chocolate éclair bar she’d impetuously bought from the Y’s ice cream truck before the meeting. “So, you talked about me here, huh?” Sean shut his eyes. “I’m sorry she mentioned that.” “No, it’s all right,” Hanna interrupted. “I didn’t realize how much all this…meant to you. And I really like some of the stuff they were saying. About, um, the person being someone you love. I’m all for that. And everyone seems really sweet.” She felt surprised the words were coming out of her mouth. She actually kind of meant them. Sean shrugged. “Yeah, it’s okay.” Hanna frowned, surprised by his apathy. Then she sighed and raised her eyes. “Sean, I’m really sorry about what happened. About…about the car. I just…I don’t really know how to apologize. I just feel so stupid. But I can’t deal with you hating me.” Sean was quiet. “I don’t hate you. Things came out kind of harsh on Friday. I think we were both in weird places. I mean, I don’t think you should’ve done what you did, but…” He shrugged. “You’re volunteering at the clinic, right?” “Uh-huh.” She hoped her nose didn’t wrinkle up in disgust. He nodded a few times. “I think that’s really good. I’m sure you’ll brighten the patients’ day.” Hanna felt her cheeks flush with gratitude, but his sweetness didn’t surprise her. Sean was a textbook good, compassionate guy—he gave money to homeless people in Philly, recycled his old cell phones, and never badmouthed anyone, even celebrities who existed to be made fun of. It had been one of the reasons she’d first come to love Sean back in sixth grade when she still was a chubby loser. But just last week, Sean had been hers. She’d come a long way from being a loserish girl who did Ali’s gossipy dirty work, and she couldn’t let a little drunken error in judgment at a field party ruin their relationship. Although…there was something—or someone—else that might ruin their relationship. I can RUIN you. “Sean?” Hanna’s heart pounded. “Have you gotten any weird texts about me?” “Texts?” Sean repeated. He cocked his head. “No…” Hanna bit her fingernail. “If you do,” she said, “don’t believe them.” “All right.” Sean smiled at her. Hanna felt electric. “So,” she said after a pause. “Are you still going to Foxy?” Sean looked away. “I guess. Probably with a bunch of guys or whatever.” “Save me a dance,” she purred, and squeezed his hand. She loved the way his hands felt—solid, warm, and masculine. It made her so happy to touch him that maybe she could give up sex until marriage. She and Sean would stay constantly vertical, cover their eyes at sex scenes, and avoid Victoria’s Secret in the mall. If that was what it took to be with the only boy she’d ever kind of, well, loved, then maybe Hanna could make that sacrifice. Or maybe, if the way Sean was eyeing her midriff again was any indication, she could talk him out of it. 11 DIDN’T EMILY’S MOTHER EVER TEACH HER NOT TO GET IN STRANGERS’ CARS? Emily twisted the dial on the Fresh Fields’ gumball machine. It was Wednesday after swim practice, and she was picking up stuff for dinner for her mom. She hit the gumball machine every time she came into Fresh Fields, and had made a game out of it: if she got a yellow gumball, something good would happen to her. She looked at the gumball in her palm. It was green. “Hey.” Someone stood over her. Emily looked up. “Aria. Hey.” As usual, Aria clearly wasn’t afraid to stand out with her outfit. She wore a neon blue puffy vest that accentuated her arresting, ice-blue eyes. And although she wore the school’s standard-issue uniform skirt, she’d hiked it up well above her knees and paired it with black leggings and funky royal blue ballet flats. Her black hair was up in a high, cheerleader-style ponytail. It completely worked, and most of the guys in the Fresh Fields parking lot under seventy-five were staring at her. Aria leaned closer. “You holding up okay?” “Yeah. You?” Aria shrugged. She gave a surreptitious glance around the parking lot, which was full of eager cart boys pushing stray carts into the corral. “You haven’t gotten any—” “Nope.” Emily avoided Aria’s eyes. She’d deleted Monday’s text from A—the one about her new love—so it was almost as if it hadn’t happened. “You?” “Nada.” Aria shrugged. “Maybe we’re in the clear.” We’re not, Emily wanted to say. She chewed on the inside of her cheek. “Well, you can call me anytime.” Aria took a step toward the soda cases. Emily left the store, a cold sweat covering her body. Why was she the only one who’d heard from A, anyway? Was A singling her out? She put the grocery bag into her backpack, unlocked her bike, and pedaled out of the parking lot. As she turned onto a side street that was nothing but miles of white-picket farm fencing, she felt the teensiest hint of fall in the air. Fall in Rosewood always reminded Emily that it was the start of swimming season. That was usually a good thing, but this year, Emily felt uneasy. Coach Lauren had made the captain announcement yesterday after the Rosewood Tank ended. All the girls had mobbed Emily to congratulate her, and when she’d told her parents, her mom had gotten teary-eyed. Emily knew she should feel happy—things were back to normal. Except she felt like she’d already irrevocably changed. “Emily!” someone called behind her. She twisted around to see who was calling her, and her bike’s front wheel skidded on a wet patch of leaves. All of a sudden, she found herself on the ground. “Oh my God, are you okay?” a voice called. Emily opened her eyes. Standing over her was Toby Cavanaugh. He had the hood of his parka up, so his face looked shadowed and hollow. She yelped. Yesterday’s incident in the locker room hallway kept coming back to her. Toby’s face, his frustrated expression. How he’d just looked at Ben, and Ben had backed off. And was it a coincidence that he’d been coming through the hall at that moment, or had he been following her? She thought of A’s note. Although most of us have totally changed…Well, Toby certainly had. Toby crouched down. “Let me help you.” Emily pushed the bike off herself, cautiously moved her legs, then pulled up her pant leg to inspect the long, harsh scrape on her shin. “I’m fine.” “You dropped this back there.” Toby handed Emily her lucky change purse. It was made of pink patent leather and had a monogrammed E on the front; Ali had given it to Emily a month before she went missing. “Um, thanks.” Emily took it from him, feeling uneasy. Toby frowned at the scrape. “That looks kind of bad. You want to get into my car? I think I have some Band-Aids….” Emily’s heart pounded. First she’d gotten that note from A, then Toby had rescued her in the locker room, now this. Why was he at Tate, anyway? Wasn’t he supposed to be in Maine? And she’d always wondered if Toby knew about The Jenna Thing and why he’d confessed. “Really. I’m okay,” she said, her voice rising. “Can I at least drive you somewhere?” “No!” Emily yelped. Then she noticed how much blood was gushing out of her leg. She despised seeing blood. Her arms started to feel limp. “Emily?” Toby asked her. “Are you…?” Emily’s vision warped. She couldn’t faint right now. She had to get away from Toby. Although most of us have totally changed…And then everything went black. When she woke up, she was lying in the backseat of a small car. A bunch of mini Band-Aids crisscrossed the scrape on her leg. She looked around woozily, trying to get her bearings, when she noticed who was driving. Toby twisted around. “Boo.” Emily screamed. “Whoa!” Toby paused at a stoplight and held his hands in the air, a gesture that said, Don’t shoot! “Sorry. I was just playing.” Emily sat up. The backseat was filled with stuff: empty Gatorade bottles, spiral-bound notebooks, textbooks, beat-up sneakers, and a pair of gray sweats. Toby’s seat cushion had worn off in places, revealing a core of ratty blue foam. A Grateful Dead dancing bear air freshener hung from the rearview mirror. The car didn’t smell fresh, though. It smelled sharp and acrid. “What are you doing?” Emily screeched. “Where are we going?” “You passed out,” Toby said calmly. “From the blood, maybe. I didn’t know what to do, so I lifted you up and put you in my car. I stuck your bike in my trunk.” Emily glanced at her feet; there was her backpack. Toby picked her up? Like, in his arms? She felt so freaked, she felt like she was going to faint again. Looking around, she didn’t recognize the woodsy road they were on. They could be anywhere. “Let me out,” Emily cried. “I can bike from here.” “But there isn’t a shoulder….” “Seriously. Pull over.” Toby pulled over to the grassy hump and faced her. The corners of his mouth drooped down and his eyes widened in concern. “I didn’t mean…” He ran his hand over his chin. “What was I supposed to do? Leave you there?” “Yes,” Emily said. “Well, um, I’m sorry then.” Toby got out of the car, walked to her side, and opened her door. A lock of dark hair fell over his eyes. “At school, I volunteered for the EMS unit. I kind of want to rescue everything now. Even, like, roadkill.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/flawless-pretty-little-liars-2/page-12.html","bookId":2379,"book":{"id":2379,"title":"Flawless (Pretty Little Liars #2)","description":"Storyline: Flawless (Pretty Little Liars #2) In the exclusive town of Rosewood, Pennsylvania, where the sweetest smiles hide the darkest secrets, four pretty little liars--Spencer, Aria, Emily, and Hanna--have been very bad girls. . . .
