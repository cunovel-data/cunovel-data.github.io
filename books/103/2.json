[bbe] Now it came about in those days that an order went out from Caesar Augustus that there was to be a numbering of all the world. 2:2 [hgb] 这 是 居 里 扭 作 叙 利 亚 巡 抚 的 时 候 ， 头 一 次 行 报 名 上 册 的 事 。 [kjv] (And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.) [bbe] This was the first numbering, which was made when Quirinius was ruler of Syria. 2:3 [hgb] 众 人 各 归 各 城 ， 报 名 上 册 。 [kjv] And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. [bbe] And all men went to be numbered, everyone to his town. 2:4 [hgb] 约 瑟 也 从 加 利 利 的 拿 撒 勒 城 上 犹 太 去 ， 到 了 大 卫 的 城 ， 名 叫 伯 利 恒 ， 因 他 本 是 大 卫 一 族 一 家 的 人 。 [kjv] And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:) [bbe] And Joseph went up from Galilee, out of the town of Nazareth, into Judaea, to Beth-lehem, the town of David, because he was of the house and family of David, 2:5 [hgb] 要 和 他 所 聘 之 妻 马 利 亚 ， 一 同 报 名 上 册 。 那 时 马 利 亚 的 身 孕 已 经 重 了 。 [kjv] To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. [bbe] To be put on the list with Mary, his future wife, who was about to become a mother. 2:6 [hgb] 他 们 在 那 里 的 时 候 ， 马 利 亚 的 产 期 到 了 。 [kjv] And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. [bbe] And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. 2:7 [hgb] 就 生 了 头 胎 的 儿 子 ， 用 布 包 起 来 ， 放 在 马 槽 里 ， 因 为 客 店 里 没 有 地 方 。 [kjv] And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn. [bbe] And she had her first son; and folding him in linen, she put him to rest in the place where the cattle had their food, because there was no room for them in the house. 2:8 [hgb] 在 伯 利 恒 之 野 地 里 有 牧 羊 的 人 ， 夜 间 按 着 更 次 看 守 羊 群 。 [kjv] And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. [bbe] And in the same country there were keepers of sheep in the fields, watching over their flock by night. 2:9 [hgb] 有 主 的 使 者 站 在 他 们 旁 边 ， 主 的 荣 光 四 面 照 着 他 们 。 牧 羊 的 人 就 甚 惧 怕 。 [kjv] And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. [bbe] And an angel of the Lord came to them, and the glory of the Lord was shining round about them: and fear came on them. 2:10 [hgb] 那 天 使 对 他 们 说 ， 不 要 惧 怕 ， 我 报 给 你 们 大 喜 的 信 息 ， 是 关 乎 万 民 的 。 [kjv] And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. [bbe] And the angel said, Have no fear; for truly, I give you good news of great joy which will be for all the people: 2:11 [hgb] 因 今 天 在 大 卫 的 城 里 ， 为 你 们 生 了 救 主 ， 就 是 主 基 督 。 [kjv] For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord. [bbe] For on this day, in the town of David, a Saviour has come to birth, who is Christ the Lord. 2:12 [hgb] 你 们 要 看 见 一 个 婴 孩 ， 包 着 布 ， 卧 在 马 槽 里 ， 那 就 是 记 号 了 。 [kjv] And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger. [bbe] And this is the sign to you: you will see a young child folded in linen, in the place where the cattle have their food. 2:13 [hgb] 忽 然 有 一 大 队 天 兵 ， 同 那 天 使 赞 美 神 说 ， [kjv] And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, [bbe] And suddenly there was with the angel a great band of spirits from heaven, giving praise to God, and saying, 2:14 [hgb] 在 至 高 之 处 荣 耀 归 与 神 ， 在 地 上 平 安 归 与 他 所 喜 悦 的 人 。 （ 有 古 卷 作 喜 悦 归 与 人 ） 。 [kjv] Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men. [bbe] Glory to God in the highest, and on the earth peace among men with whom he is well pleased. 2:15 [hgb] 众 天 使 离 开 他 们 升 天 去 了 ， 牧 羊 的 人 彼 此 说 ， 我 们 往 伯 利 恒 去 ， 看 看 所 成 的 事 ， 就 是 主 所 指 示 我 们 的 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us. [bbe] And when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the keepers of the sheep said to one another, Let us go now to Beth-lehem, and see this thing which has come about, which the Lord has made clear to us. 2:16 [hgb] 他 们 急 忙 去 了 ， 就 寻 见 马 利 亚 和 约 瑟 ， 又 有 那 婴 孩 卧 在 马 槽 里 。 [kjv] And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger. [bbe] And they came quickly, and saw Mary and Joseph, and the child in the place where the cattle had their food. 2:17 [hgb] 既 然 看 见 ， 就 把 天 使 论 这 孩 子 的 话 传 开 了 。 [kjv] And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child. [bbe] And when they saw it, they gave them an account of the things which had been said to them about the child. 2:18 [hgb] 凡 听 见 的 ， 就 诧 异 牧 羊 之 人 对 他 们 所 说 的 话 。 [kjv] And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds. [bbe] And all those to whose ears it came were full of wonder at the things said by the keepers of the sheep. 2:19 [hgb] 马 利 亚 却 把 这 一 切 的 事 存 在 心 里 ， 反 复 思 想 。 [kjv] But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart. [bbe] But Mary kept all these words in her heart, and gave much thought to them. 2:20 [hgb] 牧 羊 的 人 回 去 了 ， 因 所 听 见 所 看 见 的 一 切 事 ， 正 如 天 使 向 他 们 所 说 的 ， 就 归 荣 耀 与 神 ， 赞 美 他 。 [kjv] And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them. [bbe] Then the keepers of the sheep went back, giving glory and praise to God for all the things which had come to their ears and which they had seen, as it had been said to them. 2:21 [hgb] 满 了 八 天 ， 就 给 孩 子 行 割 礼 ， 与 他 起 名 叫 耶 稣 ， 这 就 是 没 有 成 胎 以 前 ， 天 使 所 起 的 名 。 [kjv] And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb. [bbe] And when, after eight days, the time came for his circumcision, he was named Jesus, the name which the angel had given to him before his birth. 2:22 [hgb] 按 摩 西 律 法 满 了 洁 净 的 日 子 ， 他 们 带 着 孩 子 上 耶 路 撒 冷 去 ， 要 把 他 献 与 主 。 [kjv] And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord; [bbe] And when the necessary days for making them clean by the law of Moses had come to an end, they took him to Jerusalem to give him to the Lord 2:23 [hgb] （ 正 如 主 的 律 法 上 所 记 ， 凡 头 生 的 男 子 ， 必 称 圣 归 主 。 ） [kjv] (As it is written in the law of the LORD, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;) [bbe] (As it says in the law of the Lord, Every mother\u0027s first male child is to be holy to the Lord), 2:24 [hgb] 又 要 照 主 的 律 法 上 所 说 ， 或 用 一 对 班 鸠 ， 或 用 两 只 雏 鸽 献 祭 。 [kjv] And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons. [bbe] And to make an offering, as it is ordered in the law of the Lord, of two doves or other young birds. 2:25 [hgb] 在 耶 路 撒 冷 有 一 个 人 名 叫 西 面 ， 这 人 又 公 义 又 虔 诚 ， 素 常 盼 望 以 色 列 的 安 慰 者 来 到 ， 又 有 圣 灵 在 他 身 上 。 [kjv] And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was upon him. [bbe] And there was then in Jerusalem a man whose name was Simeon; and he was an upright man, fearing God and waiting for the comfort of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was on him. 2:26 [hgb] 他 得 了 圣 灵 的 启 示 ， 知 道 自 己 未 死 以 前 ， 必 看 见 主 所 立 的 基 督 。 [kjv] And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord\u0027s Christ. [bbe] And he had knowledge, through the Holy Spirit, that he would not see death till he had seen the Lord\u0027s Christ. 2:27 [hgb] 他 受 了 圣 灵 的 感 动 ， 进 入 圣 殿 。 正 遇 见 耶 稣 的 父 母 抱 着 孩 子 进 来 ， 要 照 律 法 的 规 矩 办 理 。 [kjv] And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law, [bbe] And full of the Spirit he came into the Temple; and when the father and mother came in with the child Jesus, to do with him what was ordered by the law, 2:28 [hgb] 西 面 就 用 手 接 过 他 来 ， 称 颂 神 说 ， [kjv] Then took he him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said, [bbe] Then he took him in his arms and gave praise to God and said, 2:29 [hgb] 主 阿 ， 如 今 可 以 照 你 的 话 ， 释 放 仆 人 安 然 去 世 。 [kjv] Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: [bbe] Now you are letting your servant go in peace, O Lord, as you have said; 2:30 [hgb] 因 为 我 的 眼 睛 已 经 看 见 你 的 救 恩 。 [kjv] For mine eyes have seen thy salvation, [bbe] For my eyes have seen your salvation, 2:31 [hgb] 就 是 你 在 万 民 面 前 所 预 备 的 。 [kjv] Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people; [bbe] Which you have made ready before the face of all nations; 2:32 [hgb] 是 照 亮 外 邦 人 的 光 ， 又 是 你 民 以 色 列 的 荣 耀 。 [kjv] A light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel. [bbe] A light of revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of your people Israel. 2:33 [hgb] 孩 子 的 父 母 ， 因 这 论 耶 稣 的 话 就 希 奇 。 [kjv] And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him. [bbe] And his father and mother were full of wonder at the things which were said about him. 2:34 [hgb] 西 面 给 他 们 祝 福 ， 又 对 孩 子 的 母 亲 马 利 亚 说 ， 这 孩 子 被 立 ， 是 要 叫 以 色 列 中 许 多 人 跌 倒 ， 许 多 人 兴 起 。 又 要 作 毁 谤 的 话 柄 。 叫 许 多 人 心 里 的 意 念 显 露 出 来 。 你 自 己 的 心 也 要 被 刀 刺 透 。 [kjv] And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against; [bbe] And Simeon gave them his blessing and said to Mary, his mother, See, this child will be the cause of the downfall and the lifting up of great numbers of people in Israel, and he will be a sign against which hard words will be said; 2:35 [hgb] [kjv] (Yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. [bbe] (And a sword will go through your heart;) so that the secret thoughts of men may come to light. 2:36 [hgb] 又 有 女 先 知 名 叫 亚 拿 ， 是 亚 设 支 派 法 内 力 的 女 儿 ， 年 纪 已 经 老 迈 ， 从 作 童 女 出 嫁 的 时 候 ， 同 丈 夫 住 了 七 年 ， 就 寡 居 了 。 [kjv] And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity; [bbe] And there was one, Anna, a woman prophet, the daughter of Phanuel, of the family of Asher (she was very old, and after seven years of married life 2:37 [hgb] 现 在 已 经 八 十 四 岁 ， （ 或 作 就 寡 居 了 八 十 四 年 ） 并 不 离 开 圣 殿 ， 禁 食 祈 求 ， 昼 夜 事 奉 神 。 [kjv] And she was a widow of about fourscore and four years, which departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day. [bbe] She had been a widow for eighty-four years); she was in the Temple at all times, worshipping with prayers and going without food, night and day. 2:38 [hgb] 正 当 那 时 ， 她 进 前 来 称 谢 神 ， 将 孩 子 的 事 ， 对 一 切 盼 望 耶 路 撒 冷 得 救 赎 的 人 讲 说 。 [kjv] And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord, and spake of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem. [bbe] And coming up at that time, she gave praise to God, talking of him to all those who were waiting for the freeing of Jerusalem. 2:39 [hgb] 约 瑟 和 马 利 亚 ， 照 主 的 律 法 ， 办 完 了 一 切 的 事 ， 就 回 加 利 利 ， 到 自 己 的 城 拿 撒 勒 去 了 。 [kjv] And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth. [bbe] And when they had done all the things which were ordered by the law of the Lord, they went back to Galilee, to Nazareth, the town where they were living. 2:40 [hgb] 孩 子 渐 渐 长 大 ， 强 健 起 来 ， 充 满 智 慧 。 又 有 神 的 恩 在 他 身 上 。 [kjv] And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him. [bbe] And the child became tall and strong and full of wisdom, and the grace of God was on him. 2:41 [hgb] 每 年 到 逾 越 节 ， 他 父 母 就 上 耶 路 撒 冷 去 。 [kjv] Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover. [bbe] And every year his father and mother went to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover. 2:42 [hgb] 当 他 十 二 岁 的 时 候 ， 他 们 按 着 节 期 的 规 矩 上 去 。 [kjv] And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. [bbe] And when he was twelve years old, they went up, as their way was, to the feast; 2:43 [hgb] 守 满 了 节 期 ， 他 们 回 去 ， 孩 童 耶 稣 仍 旧 在 耶 路 撒 冷 。 他 的 父 母 并 不 知 道 。 [kjv] And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it. [bbe] And when the days of the feast came to an end and they were going back, the boy Jesus was still in Jerusalem, but they had no knowledge of it: 2:44 [hgb] 以 为 他 在 同 行 的 人 中 间 ， 走 了 一 天 的 路 程 ， 就 在 亲 族 和 熟 识 的 人 中 找 他 。 [kjv] But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day\u0027s journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance. [bbe] And in the belief that he was with some of their number, they went a day\u0027s journey; and after looking for him among their relations and friends, 2:45 [hgb] 既 找 不 着 ， 就 回 耶 路 撒 冷 去 找 他 。 [kjv] And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him. [bbe] And seeing that he was not there, they went back to Jerusalem, to make search for him. 2:46 [hgb] 过 了 三 天 ， 就 遇 见 他 在 殿 里 ， 坐 在 教 师 中 间 ， 一 面 听 ， 一 面 问 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions. [bbe] And after three days they came across him in the Temple, seated among the wise men, giving ear to their words and putting questions to them. 2:47 [hgb] 凡 听 见 他 的 ， 都 希 奇 他 的 聪 明 ， 和 他 的 应 对 。 [kjv] And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers. [bbe] And all to whose ears it came were full of wonder at his knowledge and the answers which he gave. 2:48 [hgb] 他 父 母 看 见 就 很 希 奇 。 他 母 亲 对 他 说 ， 我 儿 ， 为 什 么 向 我 们 这 样 行 呢 ？ 看 哪 ， 你 父 亲 和 我 伤 心 来 找 你 。 [kjv] And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. [bbe] And when they saw him they were surprised, and his mother said to him, Son, why have you done this to us? see, your father and I have been looking for you with sorrow. 2:49 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 为 什 么 找 我 呢 ？ 岂 不 知 我 应 当 以 我 父 的 事 为 念 吗 ？ （ 或 作 岂 不 知 我 应 当 在 我 父 的 家 里 吗 ） [kjv] And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? wist ye not that I must be about my Father\u0027s business? [bbe] And he said to them, Why were you looking for me? was it not clear to you that my right place was in my Father\u0027s house? 2:50 [hgb] 他 所 说 的 这 话 ， 他 们 不 明 白 。 [kjv] And they understood not the saying which he spake unto them. [bbe] And his words seemed strange to them. 2:51 [hgb] 他 就 同 他 们 下 去 ， 回 到 拿 撒 勒 。 并 且 顺 从 他 们 。 他 母 亲 把 这 一 切 的 事 都 存 在 心 里 。 [kjv] And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart. [bbe] And he went down with them and came to Nazareth; and did as he was ordered: and his mother kept all these words in her heart. 2:52 [hgb] 耶 稣 的 智 慧 和 身 量 ， （ 身 量 或 作 年 纪 ） 并 神 和 人 喜 爱 他 的 心 ， 都 一 齐 增 长 。 [kjv] And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man. [bbe] And Jesus was increasing in wisdom and in years, and in grace before God and men.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155/2125.html","bookId":103,"book":{"id":103,"title":"路加福音 Luke","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 大 人 哪 ， 有 好 些 人 提 笔 作 书 ， 述 说 在 我 们 中 间 所 成 就 的 事 ， 是 照 传 道 的 人 ， 从 起 初 亲 眼 看 见 ， 又 传 给 我 们 的 。 [kjv] Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a decla...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
