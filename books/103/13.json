\n [bbe] And he, in answer, said to them, Are you of the opinion that these Galilaeans were worse than all other Galilaeans, because these things were done to them? \n 13:3 [hgb] 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 不 是 的 。 你 们 若 不 悔 改 ， 都 要 如 此 灭 亡 。 \n [kjv] I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. \n [bbe] I say to you, It is not so: but if your hearts are not changed, you will all come to the same end. \n 13:4 [hgb] 从 前 西 罗 亚 楼 倒 塌 了 ， 压 死 十 八 个 人 ， 你 们 以 为 那 些 人 比 一 切 住 在 耶 路 撒 冷 的 人 更 有 罪 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Or those eighteen, upon whom the tower in Siloam fell, and slew them, think ye that they were sinners above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem? \n [bbe] Or those eighteen men who were crushed by the fall of the tower of Siloam, were they worse than all the other men living in Jerusalem? \n 13:5 [hgb] 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 不 是 的 。 你 们 若 不 悔 改 ， 都 要 如 此 灭 亡 。 \n [kjv] I tell you, Nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish. \n [bbe] I say to you, It is not so: but if your hearts are not changed, you will all come to an end in the same way. \n 13:6 [hgb] 于 是 用 比 喻 说 ， 一 个 人 有 一 棵 无 花 果 树 ， 栽 在 葡 萄 园 里 。 他 来 到 树 前 找 果 子 ， 却 找 不 着 。 \n [kjv] He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. \n [bbe] And he made up this story for them: A certain man had a fig-tree in his garden, and he came to get fruit from it, and there was no fruit. \n 13:7 [hgb] 就 对 管 园 的 说 ， 看 哪 ， 我 这 三 年 ， 来 到 这 无 花 果 树 前 找 果 子 ， 竟 找 不 着 ， 把 它 砍 了 吧 。 何 必 白 占 地 土 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? \n [bbe] And he said to the gardener, See, for three years I have been looking for fruit from this tree, and I have not had any: let it be cut down; why is it taking up space? \n 13:8 [hgb] 管 园 的 说 ， 主 阿 ， 今 年 且 留 着 ， 等 我 周 围 掘 开 土 ， 加 上 粪 。 \n [kjv] And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: \n [bbe] And he said, Lord, let it be for this year, and I will have the earth turned up round it, and put animal waste on it, to make it fertile: \n 13:9 [hgb] 以 后 若 结 果 子 便 罢 。 不 然 再 把 它 砍 了 。 \n [kjv] And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. \n [bbe] And if, after that, it has fruit, it is well; if not, let it be cut down. \n 13:10 [hgb] 安 息 日 ， 耶 稣 在 会 堂 里 教 训 人 。 \n [kjv] And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath. \n [bbe] And he was teaching in one of the Synagogues on the Sabbath. \n 13:11 [hgb] 有 一 个 女 人 ， 被 鬼 附 着 病 了 十 八 年 。 腰 弯 得 一 点 直 不 起 来 。 \n [kjv] And, behold, there was a woman which had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up herself. \n [bbe] And there was a woman who had had a disease for eighteen years; she was bent, and was not able to make herself straight. \n 13:12 [hgb] 耶 稣 看 见 ， 便 叫 过 她 来 ， 对 她 说 ， 女 人 ， 你 脱 离 这 病 了 。 \n [kjv] And when Jesus saw her, he called her to him, and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity. \n [bbe] And when Jesus saw her, he said to her, Woman, you are made free from your disease. \n 13:13 [hgb] 于 是 用 两 只 手 按 着 她 。 她 立 刻 直 起 腰 来 ， 就 归 荣 耀 与 神 。 \n [kjv] And he laid his hands on her: and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. \n [bbe] And he put his hands on her, and she was made straight, and gave praise to God. \n 13:14 [hgb] 管 会 堂 的 ， 因 为 耶 稣 在 安 息 日 治 病 ， 就 气 忿 忿 地 对 众 人 说 ， 有 六 日 应 当 作 工 。 那 六 日 之 内 ， 可 以 来 求 医 ， 在 安 息 日 却 不 可 。 \n [kjv] And the ruler of the synagogue answered with indignation, because that Jesus had healed on the sabbath day, and said unto the people, There are six days in which men ought to work: in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day. \n [bbe] And the ruler of the Synagogue was angry because Jesus had made her well on the Sabbath, and he said to the people, There are six days in which men may do work: so come on those days to be made well, and not on the Sabbath. \n 13:15 [hgb] 主 说 ， 假 冒 为 善 的 人 哪 ， 难 道 你 们 各 人 在 安 息 日 不 解 开 槽 上 的 牛 驴 ， 牵 去 饮 吗 ？ \n [kjv] The Lord then answered him, and said, Thou hypocrite, doth not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall, and lead him away to watering? \n [bbe] But the Lord gave him an answer and said, O you false men! do you not, every one of you, on the Sabbath, let loose his ox and his ass and take it to the water? \n 13:16 [hgb] 况 且 这 女 人 本 是 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 后 裔 ， 被 撒 但 捆 绑 了 这 十 八 年 ， 不 当 在 安 息 日 解 开 她 的 绑 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day? \n [bbe] And is it not right for this daughter of Abraham, who has been in the power of Satan for eighteen years, to be made free on the Sabbath? \n 13:17 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 这 话 ， 他 的 敌 人 都 惭 愧 了 。 众 人 因 他 所 行 一 切 荣 耀 的 事 ， 就 都 欢 喜 了 。 \n [kjv] And when he had said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him. \n [bbe] And when he said these things, those who were against him were shamed, and all the people were full of joy because of the great things which were done by him. \n 13:18 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 神 的 国 ， 好 像 什 么 ？ 我 拿 什 么 来 比 较 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and whereunto shall I resemble it? \n [bbe] Then he said, What is the kingdom of God like? what comparison may I make of it? \n 13:19 [hgb] 好 像 一 粒 芥 菜 种 ， 有 人 拿 去 种 在 园 子 里 。 长 大 成 树 ， 天 上 的 飞 鸟 ， 宿 在 它 的 枝 上 。 \n [kjv] It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and cast into his garden; and it grew, and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the air lodged in the branches of it. \n [bbe] It is like a grain of mustard seed which a man took and put in his garden, and it became a tree, and the birds of heaven made their resting-places in its branches. \n 13:20 [hgb] 又 说 ， 我 拿 什 么 来 比 神 的 国 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And again he said, Whereunto shall I liken the kingdom of God? \n [bbe] And again he said, What is the kingdom of God like? \n 13:21 [hgb] 好 比 面 酵 ， 有 妇 人 拿 来 藏 在 三 斗 面 里 ， 直 等 全 团 都 发 起 来 。 \n [kjv] It is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. \n [bbe] It is like leaven, which a woman put into three measures of meal, and it was all leavened. \n 13:22 [hgb] 耶 稣 往 耶 路 撒 冷 去 ， 在 所 经 过 的 各 城 各 乡 教 训 人 。 \n [kjv] And he went through the cities and villages, teaching, and journeying toward Jerusalem. \n [bbe] And he went on his way, through towns and country places, teaching and journeying to Jerusalem. \n 13:23 [hgb] 有 一 个 人 问 他 说 ， 主 阿 ， 得 救 的 人 少 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Then said one unto him, Lord, are there few that be saved? And he said unto them, \n [bbe] And someone said to him, Lord, will only a small number have salvation? And he said to them, \n 13:24 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 众 人 说 ， 你 们 要 努 力 进 窄 门 。 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 将 来 有 许 多 人 想 要 进 去 ， 却 是 不 能 。 \n [kjv] Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in, and shall not be able. \n [bbe] Do your best to go in by the narrow door, for I say to you, A number will make the attempt to go in, but will not be able to do so. \n 13:25 [hgb] 及 至 家 主 起 来 关 了 门 ， 你 们 站 在 外 面 叩 门 ， 说 ， 主 阿 ， 给 我 们 开 门 ， 他 就 回 答 说 ， 我 不 认 识 你 们 ， 不 晓 得 你 们 是 哪 里 来 的 。 \n [kjv] When once the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, and ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not whence ye are: \n [bbe] When the master of the house has got up, and the door has been shut, and you, still outside, give blows on the door, saying, Lord, let us in; he will make answer and say, I have no knowledge of where you come from. \n 13:26 [hgb] 那 时 ， 你 们 要 说 ， 我 们 在 你 面 前 吃 过 喝 过 ， 你 也 在 我 们 的 街 上 教 训 过 人 。 \n [kjv] Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets. \n [bbe] Then you will say, We have taken food and drink with you, and you were teaching in our streets. \n 13:27 [hgb] 他 要 说 ， 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 我 不 晓 得 你 们 是 哪 里 来 的 。 你 们 这 一 切 作 恶 的 人 ， 离 开 我 去 吧 。 \n [kjv] But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. \n [bbe] But he will say, Truly, I have no knowledge of you or where you come from; go away from me, you workers of evil. \n 13:28 [hgb] 你 们 要 看 见 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 以 撒 ， 雅 各 ， 和 众 先 知 ， 都 在 神 的 国 里 ， 你 们 却 被 赶 到 外 面 。 在 那 里 必 要 哀 哭 切 齿 了 。 \n [kjv] There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when ye shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out. \n [bbe] There will be weeping and cries of sorrow when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves are shut outside. \n 13:29 [hgb] 从 东 ， 从 西 ， 从 南 ， 从 北 ， 将 有 人 来 ， 在 神 的 国 里 坐 席 。 \n [kjv] And they shall come from the east, and from the west, and from the north, and from the south, and shall sit down in the kingdom of God. \n [bbe] And they will come from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south, and take their places in the kingdom of God. \n 13:30 [hgb] 只 是 有 在 后 的 将 要 在 前 ， 有 在 前 的 将 要 在 后 。 \n [kjv] And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last. \n [bbe] And the last will be first, and the first will be last. \n 13:31 [hgb] 正 当 那 时 ， 有 几 个 法 利 赛 人 来 对 耶 稣 说 ， 离 开 这 里 去 吧 。 因 为 希 律 想 要 杀 你 。 \n [kjv] The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Get thee out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill thee. \n [bbe] At that time, certain Pharisees came to him and said, Go away from this place, because Herod\u0027s purpose is to put you to death. \n 13:32 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 你 们 去 告 诉 那 个 狐 狸 说 ， 今 天 明 天 我 赶 鬼 治 病 ， 第 三 天 我 的 事 就 成 全 了 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto them, Go ye, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected. \n [bbe] And he said, Go and say to that fox, I send out evil spirits and do works of mercy today and tomorrow, and on the third day my work will be complete. \n 13:33 [hgb] 虽 然 这 样 ， 今 天 明 天 后 天 我 必 须 前 行 。 因 为 先 知 在 耶 路 撒 冷 之 外 丧 命 是 不 能 的 。 \n [kjv] Nevertheless I must walk to day, and to morrow, and the day following: for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem. \n [bbe] But I have to go on my way today and tomorrow and the third day, for it is not right for a prophet to come to his death outside Jerusalem. \n 13:34 [hgb] 耶 路 撒 冷 阿 ， 耶 路 撒 冷 阿 ， 你 常 杀 害 先 知 ， 又 用 石 头 打 死 那 奉 差 遣 到 你 这 里 来 的 人 。 我 多 次 愿 意 聚 集 你 的 儿 女 ， 好 像 母 鸡 把 小 鸡 聚 集 在 翅 膀 底 下 ， 只 是 你 们 不 愿 意 。 \n [kjv] O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which killest the prophets, and stonest them that are sent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen doth gather her brood under her wings, and ye would not! \n [bbe] O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, putting to death the prophets, and stoning those who were sent to her! again and again would I have taken your children to myself, as a bird takes her young ones under her wings, but you would not! \n 13:35 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 你 们 的 家 成 为 荒 场 留 给 你 们 。 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 从 今 以 后 你 们 不 得 再 见 我 ， 直 等 到 你 们 说 ， 奉 主 名 来 的 是 应 当 称 颂 的 。 \n [kjv] Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord. \n [bbe] Now see, your house is waste, and I say to you, You will not see me again till you say, A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155/2136.html","bookId":103,"book":{"id":103,"title":"路加福音 Luke","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 大 人 哪 ， 有 好 些 人 提 笔 作 书 ， 述 说 在 我 们 中 间 所 成 就 的 事 ， 是 照 传 道 的 人 ， 从 起 初 亲 眼 看 见 ， 又 传 给 我 们 的 。 [kjv] Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a decla...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
