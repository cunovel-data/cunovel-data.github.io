[bbe] And he went into Jericho, and when he was going through it, 19:2 [hgb] 有 一 个 人 名 叫 撒 该 ， 作 税 吏 长 ， 是 个 财 主 。 [kjv] And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich. [bbe] A man, named Zacchaeus, who was the chief tax-farmer, and a man of wealth, 19:3 [hgb] 他 要 看 看 耶 稣 是 怎 样 的 人 。 只 因 人 多 ， 他 的 身 量 又 矮 ， 所 以 不 得 看 见 。 [kjv] And he sought to see Jesus who he was; and could not for the press, because he was little of stature. [bbe] Made an attempt to get a view of Jesus, and was not able to do so, because of the people, for he was a small man. 19:4 [hgb] 就 跑 到 前 头 ， 爬 上 桑 树 ， 要 看 耶 稣 ， 因 为 耶 稣 必 从 那 里 经 过 。 [kjv] And he ran before, and climbed up into a sycomore tree to see him: for he was to pass that way. [bbe] And he went quickly in front of them and got up into a tree to see him, for he was going that way. 19:5 [hgb] 耶 稣 到 了 那 里 ， 抬 头 一 看 ， 对 他 说 ， 撒 该 ， 快 下 来 ， 今 天 我 必 住 在 你 家 里 。 [kjv] And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and saw him, and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down; for to day I must abide at thy house. [bbe] And when Jesus came to the place, looking up, he said to him, Zacchaeus, be quick and come down, for I am coming to your house today. 19:6 [hgb] 他 就 急 忙 下 来 ， 欢 欢 喜 喜 地 接 待 耶 稣 。 [kjv] And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully. [bbe] And he came down quickly, and took him into his house with joy. 19:7 [hgb] 众 人 看 见 ， 都 私 下 议 论 说 ， 他 竟 到 罪 人 家 里 去 住 宿 。 [kjv] And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner. [bbe] And when they saw it, they were all angry, saying, He has gone into the house of a sinner. 19:8 [hgb] 撒 该 站 着 ， 对 主 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 把 所 有 的 一 半 给 穷 人 。 我 若 讹 诈 了 谁 ， 就 还 他 四 倍 。 [kjv] And Zacchaeus stood, and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold. [bbe] And Zacchaeus, waiting before him, said to the Lord, See, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone wrongly, I give him back four times as much. 19:9 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 今 天 救 恩 到 了 这 家 ， 因 为 他 也 是 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 子 孙 。 [kjv] And Jesus said unto him, This day is salvation come to this house, forsomuch as he also is a son of Abraham. [bbe] And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house, for even he is a son of Abraham. 19:10 [hgb] 人 子 来 ， 为 要 寻 找 拯 救 失 丧 的 人 。 [kjv] For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. [bbe] For the Son of man came to make search for those who are wandering from the way, and to be their Saviour. 19:11 [hgb] 众 人 正 在 听 见 这 些 话 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 因 为 将 近 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 又 因 他 们 以 为 神 的 国 快 要 显 出 来 ， 就 另 设 一 个 比 喻 说 ， [kjv] And as they heard these things, he added and spake a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear. [bbe] And while they were giving ear to these words, he made another story for them, because he was near Jerusalem, and because they were of the opinion that the kingdom of God was coming straight away. 19:12 [hgb] 有 一 个 贵 胄 往 远 方 去 ， 要 得 国 回 来 。 [kjv] He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. [bbe] So he said, A certain man of high birth went into a far-away country to get a kingdom for himself, and to come back. 19:13 [hgb] 便 叫 了 他 的 十 个 仆 人 来 ， 交 给 他 们 十 锭 银 子 （ 锭 原 文 作 弥 拿 ， 一 弥 拿 约 银 十 两 ） ， 说 ， 你 们 去 作 生 意 ， 直 等 我 回 来 。 [kjv] And he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come. [bbe] And he sent for ten of his servants and gave them ten pounds and said to them, Do business with this till I come. 19:14 [hgb] 他 本 国 的 人 却 恨 他 ， 打 发 使 者 随 后 去 说 ， 我 们 不 愿 意 这 个 人 作 我 们 的 王 。 [kjv] But his citizens hated him, and sent a message after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us. [bbe] But his people had no love for him, and sent representatives after him, saying, We will not have this man for our ruler. 19:15 [hgb] 他 既 得 国 回 来 ， 就 吩 咐 叫 那 领 银 子 的 仆 人 来 ， 要 知 道 他 们 作 生 意 赚 了 多 少 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these servants to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. [bbe] And when he came back again, having got his kingdom, he gave orders for those servants to whom he had given the money to come to him, so that he might have an account of what business they had done. 19:16 [hgb] 头 一 个 上 来 说 ， 主 阿 ， 你 的 一 锭 银 子 ， 已 经 赚 了 十 锭 。 [kjv] Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. [bbe] And the first came before him, saying, Lord, your pound has made ten pounds. 19:17 [hgb] 主 人 说 ， 好 良 善 的 仆 人 。 你 既 在 最 小 的 事 上 有 忠 心 ， 可 以 有 权 柄 管 十 座 城 。 [kjv] And he said unto him, Well, thou good servant: because thou hast been faithful in a very little, have thou authority over ten cities. [bbe] And he said to him, You have done well, O good servant: because you have done well in a small thing you will have authority over ten towns. 19:18 [hgb] 第 二 个 来 说 ， 主 阿 ， 你 的 一 锭 银 子 ， 已 经 赚 了 五 锭 。 [kjv] And the second came, saying, Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds. [bbe] And another came, saying, Your pound has made five pounds. 19:19 [hgb] 主 人 说 ， 你 也 可 以 管 五 座 城 。 [kjv] And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities. [bbe] And he said, You will be ruler over five towns. 19:20 [hgb] 又 有 一 个 来 说 ， 主 阿 ， 看 哪 ， 你 的 一 锭 银 子 在 这 里 ， 我 把 他 包 在 手 巾 里 存 着 。 [kjv] And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin: [bbe] And another came, saying, Lord, here is your pound, which I put away in a cloth; 19:21 [hgb] 我 原 是 怕 你 ， 因 为 你 是 严 厉 的 人 。 没 有 放 下 的 还 要 去 拿 ， 没 有 种 下 的 还 要 去 收 。 [kjv] For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that thou layedst not down, and reapest that thou didst not sow. [bbe] Because I was in fear of you, for you are a hard man: you take up what you have not put down, and get in grain where you have not put seed. 19:22 [hgb] 主 人 对 他 说 ， 你 这 恶 仆 ， 我 要 凭 你 的 口 ， 定 你 的 罪 。 你 既 知 道 我 是 严 厉 的 人 ， 没 有 放 下 的 还 要 去 拿 ， 没 有 种 下 的 还 要 去 收 。 [kjv] And he saith unto him, Out of thine own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that I laid not down, and reaping that I did not sow: [bbe] He said to him, By the words of your mouth you will be judged, you bad servant. You had knowledge that I am a hard man, taking up what I have not put down and getting in grain where I have not put seed; 19:23 [hgb] 为 什 么 不 把 我 的 银 子 交 给 银 行 ， 等 我 来 的 时 候 ， 连 本 带 利 都 可 以 要 回 来 呢 ？ [kjv] Wherefore then gavest not thou my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required mine own with usury? [bbe] Why then did you not put my money in a bank, so that when I came I would get it back with interest? 19:24 [hgb] 就 对 旁 边 站 着 的 人 说 ， 夺 过 他 这 一 锭 来 ， 给 那 有 十 锭 的 。 [kjv] And he said unto them that stood by, Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath ten pounds. [bbe] And he said to the others who were near, Take the pound away from him, and give it to the man who has ten. 19:25 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 主 阿 ， 他 已 经 有 十 锭 了 。 [kjv] (And they said unto him, Lord, he hath ten pounds.) [bbe] And they say to him, Lord, he has ten pounds. 19:26 [hgb] 主 人 说 ， 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 凡 有 的 ， 还 要 加 给 他 。 没 有 的 ， 连 他 所 有 的 ， 也 要 夺 过 来 。 [kjv] For I say unto you, That unto every one which hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away from him. [bbe] And I say to you that to everyone who has, more will be given, but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away. 19:27 [hgb] 至 于 我 那 些 仇 敌 不 要 我 作 他 们 王 的 ， 把 他 们 拉 来 ， 在 我 面 前 杀 了 吧 。 [kjv] But those mine enemies, which would not that I should reign over them, bring hither, and slay them before me. [bbe] And as for those who were against me, who would not have me for their ruler, let them come here, and be put to death before me. 19:28 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 完 了 这 话 ， 就 在 前 面 走 ， 上 耶 路 撒 冷 去 。 [kjv] And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem. [bbe] And when he had said this, he went on in front of them, going up to Jerusalem. 19:29 [hgb] 将 近 伯 法 其 和 伯 大 尼 ， 在 一 座 山 名 叫 橄 榄 山 那 里 。 就 打 发 两 个 门 徒 ， 说 ， [kjv] And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples, [bbe] And it came about that when he got near Beth-phage and Bethany by the mountain which is named the Mountain of Olives, he sent two of the disciples, 19:30 [hgb] 你 们 往 对 面 村 子 里 去 。 进 去 的 时 候 ， 必 看 见 一 匹 驴 驹 拴 在 那 里 ， 是 从 来 没 有 人 骑 过 的 。 可 以 解 开 牵 来 。 [kjv] Saying, Go ye into the village over against you; in the which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, whereon yet never man sat: loose him, and bring him hither. [bbe] Saying, Go into the little town in front of you, and on going in you will see a young ass fixed with a cord, on which no man has ever been seated; let him loose and take him. 19:31 [hgb] 若 有 人 问 为 什 么 解 它 ， 你 们 就 说 ， 主 要 用 它 。 [kjv] And if any man ask you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord hath need of him. [bbe] And if anyone says to you, Why are you taking him? say, The Lord has need of him. 19:32 [hgb] 打 发 的 人 去 了 ， 所 遇 见 的 ， 正 如 耶 稣 所 说 的 。 [kjv] And they that were sent went their way, and found even as he had said unto them. [bbe] And those whom he sent went away, and it was as he said. 19:33 [hgb] 他 们 解 驴 驹 的 时 候 ， 主 人 问 他 们 说 ， 解 驴 驹 作 什 么 ？ [kjv] And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said unto them, Why loose ye the colt? [bbe] And when they were getting the young ass, the owners of it said to them, Why are you taking the young ass? 19:34 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 主 要 用 它 。 [kjv] And they said, The Lord hath need of him. [bbe] And they said, The Lord has need of him. 19:35 [hgb] 他 们 牵 到 耶 稣 那 里 ， 把 自 己 的 衣 服 搭 在 上 面 ， 扶 着 耶 稣 骑 上 。 [kjv] And they brought him to Jesus: and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus thereon. [bbe] And they took him to Jesus, and they put their clothing on the ass, and Jesus got on to him. 19:36 [hgb] 走 的 时 候 ， 众 人 把 衣 服 铺 在 路 上 。 [kjv] And as he went, they spread their clothes in the way. [bbe] And while he went on his way they put their clothing down on the road in front of him. 19:37 [hgb] 将 近 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 正 下 橄 榄 山 的 时 候 ， 众 门 徒 因 所 见 过 的 一 切 异 能 ， 都 欢 乐 起 来 ， 大 声 赞 美 神 ， [kjv] And when he was come nigh, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen; [bbe] And when he came near the foot of the Mountain of Olives, all the disciples with loud voices gave praise to God with joy, because of all the great works which they had seen; 19:38 [hgb] 说 ， 奉 主 名 来 的 王 ， 是 应 当 称 颂 的 。 在 天 上 有 和 平 ， 在 至 高 之 处 有 荣 光 。 [kjv] Saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord: peace in heaven, and glory in the highest. [bbe] Saying, A blessing on the King who comes in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven and glory in the highest. 19:39 [hgb] 众 人 中 有 几 个 法 利 赛 人 对 耶 稣 说 ， 夫 子 ， 责 备 你 的 门 徒 吧 。 [kjv] And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples. [bbe] And some of the Pharisees among the people said to him, Master, make your disciples be quiet. 19:40 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 若 是 他 们 闭 口 不 说 ， 这 些 石 头 必 要 呼 叫 起 来 。 [kjv] And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out. [bbe] And he said in answer, I say to you, if these men keep quiet, the very stones will be crying out. 19:41 [hgb] 耶 稣 快 到 耶 路 撒 冷 看 见 城 ， 就 为 他 哀 哭 ， [kjv] And when he was come near, he beheld the city, and wept over it, [bbe] And when he got near and saw the town, he was overcome with weeping for it, 19:42 [hgb] 说 ， 巴 不 得 你 在 这 日 子 ， 知 道 关 系 你 平 安 的 事 。 无 奈 这 事 现 在 是 隐 藏 的 ， 叫 你 的 眼 看 不 出 来 。 [kjv] Saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes. [bbe] Saying, If you, even you, had knowledge today, of the things which give peace! but you are not able to see them. 19:43 [hgb] 因 为 日 子 将 到 ， 你 的 仇 敌 必 筑 起 土 垒 ， 周 围 环 绕 你 ， 四 面 困 住 你 ， [kjv] For the days shall come upon thee, that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and keep thee in on every side, [bbe] For the time will come when your attackers will put a wall round you, and come all round you and keep you in on every side, 19:44 [hgb] 并 要 扫 灭 你 ， 和 你 里 头 的 儿 女 ， 连 一 块 石 头 也 不 留 在 石 头 上 。 因 你 不 知 道 眷 顾 你 的 时 候 。 [kjv] And shall lay thee even with the ground, and thy children within thee; and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another; because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation. [bbe] And will make you level with the earth, and your children with you; and there will not be one stone resting on another in you, because you did not see that it was your day of mercy. 19:45 [hgb] 耶 稣 进 了 殿 ， 赶 出 里 头 作 买 卖 的 人 ， [kjv] And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought; [bbe] And he went into the Temple and put out those who were trading there, 19:46 [hgb] 对 他 们 说 ， 经 上 说 ， 我 的 殿 ， 必 作 祷 告 的 殿 。 你 们 倒 使 它 成 为 贼 窝 了 。 [kjv] Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves. [bbe] Saying to them, It has been said, My house is to be a house of prayer, but you have made it a hole of thieves. 19:47 [hgb] 耶 稣 天 天 在 殿 里 教 训 人 。 祭 司 长 ， 和 文 士 ， 与 百 姓 的 尊 长 ， 都 想 要 杀 他 。 [kjv] And he taught daily in the temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the chief of the people sought to destroy him, [bbe] And every day he was teaching in the Temple. But the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people were attempting to put him to death; 19:48 [hgb] 但 寻 不 出 法 子 来 ， 因 为 百 姓 都 侧 耳 听 他 。 [kjv] And could not find what they might do: for all the people were very attentive to hear him. [bbe] But they were not able to do anything, because the people all kept near him, being greatly interested in his words.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155/2142.html","bookId":103,"book":{"id":103,"title":"路加福音 Luke","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 大 人 哪 ， 有 好 些 人 提 笔 作 书 ， 述 说 在 我 们 中 间 所 成 就 的 事 ， 是 照 传 道 的 人 ， 从 起 初 亲 眼 看 见 ， 又 传 给 我 们 的 。 [kjv] Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a decla...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
