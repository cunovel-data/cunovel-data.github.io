{"id":2566,"no":16,"title":"Chapter 16","content":"16:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 又 对 门 徒 说 ， 有 一 个 财 主 的 管 家 。 别 人 向 他 主 人 告 他 浪 费 主 人 的 财 物 。 [kjv] And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods. [bbe] And another time he said to the disciples, There was a certain man of great wealth who had a servant; and it was said to him that this servant was wasting his goods. 16:2 [hgb] 主 人 叫 他 来 ， 对 他 说 ， 我 听 见 你 这 事 怎 么 样 呢 ？ 把 你 所 经 管 的 交 代 明 白 。 因 你 不 能 再 作 我 的 管 家 。 [kjv] And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward. [bbe] And he sent for him and said, What is this which is said about you? give me an account of all you have done, for you will no longer be the manager of my property. 16:3 [hgb] 那 管 家 心 里 说 ， 主 人 辞 我 ， 不 用 我 再 作 管 家 ， 我 将 来 作 什 么 ？ 锄 地 呢 ？ 无 力 。 讨 饭 呢 ？ 怕 羞 。 [kjv] Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed. [bbe] And the servant said to himself, What am I to do now that my lord takes away my position? I have not enough strength for working in the fields, and I would be shamed if I made requests for money from people in the streets. 16:4 [hgb] 我 知 道 怎 么 行 ， 好 叫 人 在 我 不 作 管 家 之 后 ， 接 我 到 他 们 家 里 去 。 [kjv] I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. [bbe] I have come to a decision what to do, so that when I am put out of my position they will take me into their houses. 16:5 [hgb] 于 是 把 欠 他 主 人 债 的 ， 一 个 一 个 地 叫 了 来 ， 问 头 一 个 说 ， 你 欠 我 主 人 多 少 。 [kjv] So he called every one of his lord\u0027s debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord? [bbe] And sending for every one who was in debt to his lord he said to the first, What is the amount of your debt to my lord? 16:6 [hgb] 他 说 ， 一 百 篓 油 。 每 篓 约 五 十 斤 管 家 说 ， 拿 你 的 账 快 坐 下 写 五 十 。 [kjv] And he said, An hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty. [bbe] And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said, Take your account straight away and put down fifty. 16:7 [hgb] 又 问 一 个 说 ， 你 欠 多 少 。 他 说 ， 一 百 石 麦 子 。 管 家 说 ， 拿 你 的 账 写 八 十 。 [kjv] Then said he to another, And how much owest thou? And he said, An hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore. [bbe] Then he said to another, What is the amount of your debt? And he said, A hundred measures of grain. And he said to him, Take your account and put down eighty. 16:8 [hgb] 主 人 就 夸 奖 这 不 义 的 管 家 作 事 聪 明 。 因 为 今 世 之 子 ， 在 世 事 之 上 ， 较 比 光 明 之 子 ， 更 加 聪 明 。 [kjv] And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. [bbe] And his lord was pleased with the false servant, because he had been wise; for the sons of this world are wiser in relation to their generation than the sons of light. 16:9 [hgb] 我 又 告 诉 你 们 ， 要 借 着 那 不 义 的 钱 财 ， 结 交 朋 友 。 到 了 钱 财 无 用 的 时 候 ， 他 们 可 以 接 你 们 到 永 存 的 帐 幕 里 去 。 [kjv] And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations. [bbe] And I say to you, Make friends for yourselves through the wealth of this life, so that when it comes to an end, you may be taken into the eternal resting-places. 16:10 [hgb] 人 在 最 小 的 事 上 忠 心 ， 在 大 事 上 也 忠 心 。 在 最 小 的 事 上 不 义 ， 在 大 事 上 也 不 义 。 [kjv] He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. [bbe] He who is true in a little, is true in much; he who is false in small things, is false in great. 16:11 [hgb] 倘 若 你 们 在 不 义 的 钱 财 上 不 忠 心 ， 谁 还 把 那 真 实 的 钱 财 托 付 你 们 呢 ？ [kjv] If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? [bbe] If, then, you have not been true in your use of the wealth of this life, who will give into your care the true wealth? 16:12 [hgb] 倘 若 你 们 在 别 人 的 东 西 上 不 忠 心 ， 谁 还 把 你 们 自 己 的 东 西 给 你 们 呢 ？ [kjv] And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man\u0027s, who shall give you that which is your own? [bbe] And if you have not been true in your care of the property of other people, who will give you that which is yours? 16:13 [hgb] 一 个 仆 人 不 能 事 奉 两 个 主 。 不 是 恶 这 个 爱 那 个 ， 就 是 重 这 个 轻 那 个 。 你 们 不 能 又 事 奉 神 ， 又 事 奉 玛 门 。 [kjv] No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. [bbe] No man may be a servant to two masters: for he will have hate for the one and love for the other; or he will keep to the one and have no respect for the other. You may not be servants of God and of wealth. 16:14 [hgb] 法 利 赛 人 是 贪 爱 钱 财 的 ， 他 们 听 见 这 一 切 话 ， 就 嗤 笑 耶 稣 。 [kjv] And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him. [bbe] And the Pharisees, who had a great love of money, hearing these things, were making sport of him. 16:15 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 是 在 人 面 前 自 称 为 义 的 。 你 们 的 心 ， 神 却 知 道 。 因 为 人 所 尊 贵 的 是 神 看 为 可 憎 恶 的 。 [kjv] And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God. [bbe] And he said, You take care to seem right in the eyes of men, but God sees your hearts: and those things which are important in the opinion of men, are evil in the eyes of God. 16:16 [hgb] 律 法 和 先 知 ， 到 约 翰 为 止 。 从 此 神 国 的 福 音 传 开 了 ， 人 人 努 力 要 进 去 。 [kjv] The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it. [bbe] The law and the prophets were till John: but then came the preaching of the kingdom of God, and everyone makes his way into it by force. 16:17 [hgb] 天 地 废 去 ， 较 比 律 法 的 一 点 一 画 落 空 还 容 易 。 [kjv] And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail. [bbe] But heaven and earth will come to an end before the smallest letter of the law may be dropped out. 16:18 [hgb] 凡 休 妻 另 娶 的 ， 就 是 犯 奸 淫 。 娶 被 休 之 妻 的 ， 也 是 犯 奸 淫 。 [kjv] Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery. [bbe] Everyone who puts away his wife and takes another, is a false husband: and he who is married to a woman whose husband has put her away, is no true husband to her. 16:19 [hgb] 有 一 个 财 主 ， 穿 着 紫 色 袍 和 细 麻 布 衣 服 ， 天 天 奢 华 宴 乐 。 [kjv] There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day: [bbe] Now there was a certain man of great wealth, who was dressed in fair clothing of purple and delicate linen, and was shining and glad every day. 16:20 [hgb] 又 有 一 个 讨 饭 的 ， 名 叫 拉 撒 路 ， 浑 身 生 疮 ， 被 人 放 在 财 主 门 口 ， [kjv] And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores, [bbe] And a certain poor man, named Lazarus, was stretched out at his door, full of wounds, 16:21 [hgb] 要 得 财 主 桌 子 上 掉 下 来 的 零 碎 充 饥 。 并 且 狗 来 舔 他 的 疮 。 [kjv] And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man\u0027s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores. [bbe] Desiring the broken bits of food which came from the table of the man of wealth; and even the dogs came and put their tongues on his wounds. 16:22 [hgb] 后 来 那 讨 饭 的 死 了 ， 被 天 使 带 去 放 在 亚 伯 拉 罕 的 怀 里 。 财 主 也 死 了 ， 并 且 埋 葬 了 。 [kjv] And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham\u0027s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried; [bbe] And in time the poor man came to his end, and angels took him to Abraham\u0027s breast. And the man of wealth came to his end, and was put in the earth. 16:23 [hgb] 他 在 阴 间 受 痛 苦 ， 举 目 远 远 地 望 见 亚 伯 拉 罕 ， 又 望 见 拉 撒 路 在 他 怀 里 。 [kjv] And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom. [bbe] And in hell, being in great pain, lifting up his eyes he saw Abraham, far away, and Lazarus on his breast. 16:24 [hgb] 就 喊 着 说 ， 我 祖 亚 伯 拉 罕 哪 ， 可 怜 我 吧 ， 打 发 拉 撒 路 来 ， 用 指 头 尖 蘸 点 水 ， 凉 凉 我 的 舌 头 。 因 为 我 在 这 火 焰 里 ， 极 其 痛 苦 。 [kjv] And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame. [bbe] And he gave a cry and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus, so that he may put the end of his finger in water and put it on my tongue, for I am cruelly burning in this flame. 16:25 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 儿 阿 ， 你 该 回 想 你 生 前 享 过 福 ， 拉 撒 路 也 受 过 苦 。 如 今 他 在 这 里 得 安 慰 ， 你 倒 受 痛 苦 。 [kjv] But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. [bbe] But Abraham said, Keep in mind, my son, that when you were living, you had your good things, while Lazarus had evil things: but now, he is comforted and you are in pain. 16:26 [hgb] 不 但 这 样 ， 并 且 在 你 我 之 间 ， 有 深 渊 限 定 ， 以 致 人 要 从 这 边 过 到 你 们 那 边 ， 是 不 能 的 ， 要 从 那 边 过 到 我 们 这 边 ， 也 是 不 能 的 。 [kjv] And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence. [bbe] And in addition, there is a deep division fixed between us and you, so that those who might go from here to you are not able to do so, and no one may come from you to us. 16:27 [hgb] 财 主 说 ， 我 祖 阿 ， 既 是 这 样 ， 求 你 打 发 拉 撒 路 到 我 父 家 去 。 [kjv] Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father\u0027s house: [bbe] And he said, Father, it is my request that you will send him to my father\u0027s house; 16:28 [hgb] 因 为 我 还 有 五 个 弟 兄 。 他 可 以 对 他 们 作 见 证 ， 免 得 他 们 也 来 到 这 痛 苦 的 地 方 。 [kjv] For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment. [bbe] For I have five brothers; and let him give them an account of these things, so that they may not come to this place of pain. 16:29 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 他 们 有 摩 西 和 先 知 的 话 ， 可 以 听 从 。 [kjv] Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them. [bbe] But Abraham said, They have Moses and the prophets; let them give ear to what they say. 16:30 [hgb] 他 说 ， 我 祖 亚 伯 拉 罕 哪 ， 不 是 的 。 若 有 一 个 从 死 里 复 活 的 ， 到 他 们 那 里 去 的 ， 他 们 必 要 悔 改 。 [kjv] And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent. [bbe] And he said, No, father Abraham, but if someone went to them from the dead, their hearts would be changed. 16:31 [hgb] 亚 伯 拉 罕 说 ， 若 不 听 从 摩 西 和 先 知 的 话 ， 就 是 有 一 个 从 死 里 复 活 的 ， 他 们 也 是 不 听 劝 。 [kjv] And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead. [bbe] And he said to him, If they will not give attention to Moses and the prophets, they will not be moved even if someone comes back from the dead.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155/2139.html","bookId":103,"book":{"id":103,"title":"路加福音 Luke","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 大 人 哪 ， 有 好 些 人 提 笔 作 书 ， 述 说 在 我 们 中 间 所 成 就 的 事 ， 是 照 传 道 的 人 ， 从 起 初 亲 眼 看 见 ， 又 传 给 我 们 的 。 [kjv] Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a decla...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
