And he divided unto them his living. \\n\\n [bbe] And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me that part of your property which will be mine. And he made division of his goods between them. \\n\\n 15:13 [hgb] 过 了 不 多 几 日 ， 小 儿 子 就 把 他 一 切 所 有 的 ， 都 收 拾 起 来 ， 往 远 方 去 了 。 在 那 里 任 意 放 荡 ， 浪 费 赀 财 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and took his journey into a far country, and there wasted his substance with riotous living. \\n\\n [bbe] And not long after, the younger son got together everything which was his and took a journey into a far-away country, and there all his money went in foolish living. \\n\\n 15:14 [hgb] 既 耗 尽 了 一 切 所 有 的 ， 又 遇 着 那 地 方 大 遭 饥 荒 ， 就 穷 苦 起 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want. \\n\\n [bbe] And when everything was gone, there was no food to be had in that country, and he was in need. \\n\\n 15:15 [hgb] 于 是 去 投 靠 那 地 方 的 一 个 人 ， 那 人 打 发 他 到 田 里 去 放 猪 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. \\n\\n [bbe] And he went and put himself into the hands of one of the people of that country, and he sent him into his fields to give the pigs their food. \\n\\n 15:16 [hgb] 他 恨 不 得 拿 猪 所 吃 的 豆 荚 充 饥 。 也 没 有 人 给 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave unto him. \\n\\n [bbe] And so great was his need that he would have been glad to take the pigs\u0027 food, and no one gave him anything. \\n\\n 15:17 [hgb] 他 醒 悟 过 来 ， 就 说 ， 我 父 亲 有 多 少 的 雇 工 ， 口 粮 有 余 ， 我 倒 在 这 里 饿 死 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father\u0027s have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! \\n\\n [bbe] But when he came to his senses, he said, What numbers of my father\u0027s servants have bread enough, and more, while I am near to death here through need of food! \\n\\n 15:18 [hgb] 我 要 起 来 ， 到 我 父 亲 那 里 去 ， 向 他 说 ， 父 亲 ， 我 得 罪 了 天 ， 又 得 罪 了 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I will arise and go to my father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, \\n\\n [bbe] I will get up and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have done wrong, against heaven and in your eyes: \\n\\n 15:19 [hgb] 从 今 以 后 ， 我 不 配 称 为 你 的 儿 子 ， 把 我 当 作 一 个 雇 工 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And am no more worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants. \\n\\n [bbe] I am no longer good enough to be named your son: make me like one of your servants. \\n\\n 15:20 [hgb] 于 是 起 来 往 他 父 亲 那 里 去 。 相 离 还 远 ， 他 父 亲 看 见 ， 就 动 了 慈 心 ， 跑 去 抱 着 他 的 颈 项 ， 连 连 与 他 亲 嘴 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him. \\n\\n [bbe] And he got up and went to his father. But while he was still far away, his father saw him and was moved with pity for him and went quickly and took him in his arms and gave him a kiss. \\n\\n 15:21 [hgb] 儿 子 说 ， 父 亲 ， 我 得 罪 了 天 ， 又 得 罪 了 你 ， 从 今 以 后 ， 我 不 配 称 为 你 的 儿 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy son. \\n\\n [bbe] And his son said to him, Father, I have done wrong, against heaven and in your eyes: I am no longer good enough to be named your son. \\n\\n 15:22 [hgb] 父 亲 却 吩 咐 仆 人 说 ， 把 那 上 好 的 袍 子 快 拿 出 来 给 他 穿 。 把 戒 指 戴 在 他 指 头 上 。 把 鞋 穿 在 他 脚 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet: \\n\\n [bbe] But the father said to his servants, Get out the first robe quickly, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet: \\n\\n 15:23 [hgb] 把 那 肥 牛 犊 牵 来 宰 了 ， 我 们 可 以 吃 喝 快 乐 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: \\n\\n [bbe] And get the fat young ox and put it to death, and let us have a feast, and be glad. \\n\\n 15:24 [hgb] 因 为 我 这 个 儿 子 ， 是 死 而 复 活 ， 失 而 又 得 的 。 他 们 就 快 乐 起 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry. \\n\\n [bbe] For this, my son, who was dead, is living again; he had gone away from me, and has come back. And they were full of joy. \\n\\n 15:25 [hgb] 那 时 ， 大 儿 子 正 在 田 里 。 他 回 来 离 家 不 远 ， 听 见 作 乐 跳 舞 的 声 音 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard musick and dancing. \\n\\n [bbe] Now the older son was in the field: and when he came near the house, the sounds of music and dancing came to his ears. \\n\\n 15:26 [hgb] 便 叫 过 一 个 仆 人 来 ， 问 是 什 么 事 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant. \\n\\n [bbe] And he sent for one of the servants, questioning him about what it might be. \\n\\n 15:27 [hgb] 仆 人 说 ， 你 兄 弟 来 了 。 你 父 亲 ， 因 为 得 他 无 灾 无 病 地 回 来 ， 把 肥 牛 犊 宰 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe and sound. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to him, Your brother has come; and your father has had the young ox put to death because he has come back safely. \\n\\n 15:28 [hgb] 大 儿 子 却 生 气 ， 不 肯 进 去 。 他 父 亲 就 出 来 劝 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out, and intreated him. \\n\\n [bbe] But he was angry and would not go in; and his father came out and made a request to him to come in. \\n\\n 15:29 [hgb] 他 对 父 亲 说 ， 我 服 事 你 这 多 年 ， 从 来 没 有 违 背 过 你 的 命 。 你 并 没 有 给 我 一 只 山 羊 羔 ， 叫 我 和 朋 友 ， 一 同 快 乐 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he answering said to his father, Lo, these many years do I serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment: and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends: \\n\\n [bbe] But he made answer and said to his father, See, all these years I have been your servant, doing your orders in everything: and you never gave me even a young goat so that I might have a feast with my friends: \\n\\n 15:30 [hgb] 但 你 这 个 儿 子 ， 和 娼 妓 吞 尽 了 你 的 产 业 ， 他 一 来 了 ， 你 倒 为 他 宰 了 肥 牛 犊 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But as soon as this thy son was come, which hath devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf. \\n\\n [bbe] But when this your son came, who has been wasting your property with bad women, you put to death the fat young ox for him. \\n\\n 15:31 [hgb] 父 亲 对 他 说 ， 儿 阿 ， 你 常 和 我 同 在 ， 我 一 切 所 有 的 ， 都 是 你 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to him, Son, you are with me at all times, and all I have is yours. \\n\\n 15:32 [hgb] 只 是 你 这 个 兄 弟 是 死 而 复 活 ， 失 而 又 得 的 ， 所 以 我 们 理 当 欢 喜 快 乐 。 \\n\\n [kjv] It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found. \\n\\n [bbe] But it was right to be glad and to have a feast; for this your brother, who was dead, is living again; he had gone away and has come back. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155/2138.html","bookId":103,"book":{"id":103,"title":"路加福音 Luke","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 大 人 哪 ， 有 好 些 人 提 笔 作 书 ， 述 说 在 我 们 中 间 所 成 就 的 事 ， 是 照 传 道 的 人 ， 从 起 初 亲 眼 看 见 ， 又 传 给 我 们 的 。 [kjv] Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a decla...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
