And he sat down, and taught the people out of the ship. \\n\\n [bbe] And he got into one of the boats, the property of Simon, and made a request to him to go a little way out from the land. And being seated he gave the people teaching from the boat. \\n\\n 5:4 [hgb] 讲 完 了 ， 对 西 门 说 ， 把 船 开 到 水 深 之 处 ， 下 网 打 鱼 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught. \\n\\n [bbe] And when his talk was ended, he said to Simon, Go out into deep water, and let down your nets for fish. \\n\\n 5:5 [hgb] 西 门 说 ， 夫 子 ， 我 们 整 夜 劳 力 ， 并 没 有 打 着 什 么 。 但 依 从 你 的 话 ， 我 就 下 网 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night, and have taken nothing: nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net. \\n\\n [bbe] And Simon, answering, said, Master, we were working all night and we took nothing: but at your word I will let down the nets. \\n\\n 5:6 [hgb] 他 们 下 了 网 ， 就 圈 住 许 多 鱼 ， 网 险 些 裂 开 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes: and their net brake. \\n\\n [bbe] And when they had done this, they got such a great number of fish that it seemed as if their nets would be broken; \\n\\n 5:7 [hgb] 便 招 呼 那 只 船 上 的 同 伴 来 帮 助 。 他 们 就 来 把 鱼 装 满 了 两 只 船 ， 甚 至 船 要 沉 下 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they beckoned unto their partners, which were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came, and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink. \\n\\n [bbe] And they made signs to their friends in the other boat to come to their help. And they came, and the two boats were so full that they were going down. \\n\\n 5:8 [hgb] 西 门 彼 得 看 见 ， 就 俯 伏 在 耶 稣 膝 前 ， 说 ， 主 阿 ， 离 开 我 ， 我 是 个 罪 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus\u0027 knees, saying, Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord. \\n\\n [bbe] But Simon, when he saw it, went down at the knees of Jesus and said, Go away from me, O Lord, for I am a sinner. \\n\\n 5:9 [hgb] 他 和 一 切 同 在 的 人 ， 都 惊 讶 这 一 网 所 打 的 鱼 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For he was astonished, and all that were with him, at the draught of the fishes which they had taken: \\n\\n [bbe] For he was full of wonder and so were all those who were with him, at the number of fish which they had taken; \\n\\n 5:10 [hgb] 他 的 伙 伴 西 庇 太 的 儿 子 ， 雅 各 ， 约 翰 ， 也 是 这 样 。 耶 稣 对 西 门 说 ， 不 要 怕 ， 从 今 以 后 ， 你 要 得 人 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from henceforth thou shalt catch men. \\n\\n [bbe] And so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were working with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Have no fear; from this time forward you will be a fisher of men. \\n\\n 5:11 [hgb] 他 们 把 两 只 船 拢 了 岸 ， 就 撇 下 所 有 的 跟 从 了 耶 稣 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all, and followed him. \\n\\n [bbe] And when they had got their boats to the land, they gave up everything and went after him. \\n\\n 5:12 [hgb] 有 一 回 耶 稣 在 一 个 城 里 ， 有 人 满 身 长 了 大 麻 疯 ， 看 见 他 就 俯 伏 在 地 ， 求 他 说 ， 主 若 肯 ， 必 能 叫 我 洁 净 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy: who seeing Jesus fell on his face, and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. \\n\\n [bbe] And it came about that while he was in one of the towns, there was a leper there: and when he saw Jesus he went down on his face in prayer to him, saying, Lord, if it is your pleasure, you have power to make me clean. \\n\\n 5:13 [hgb] 耶 稣 伸 手 摸 他 说 ， 我 肯 ， 你 洁 净 了 吧 。 大 麻 疯 立 刻 就 离 了 他 的 身 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will: be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him. \\n\\n [bbe] And he put out his hand to him and said, It is my pleasure; be clean. And straight away his disease went from him. \\n\\n 5:14 [hgb] 耶 稣 嘱 咐 他 ， 你 切 不 可 告 诉 人 。 只 要 去 把 身 体 给 祭 司 察 看 ， 又 要 为 你 得 了 洁 净 ， 照 摩 西 所 吩 咐 的 ， 献 上 礼 物 对 众 人 作 证 据 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and shew thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. \\n\\n [bbe] And he gave him orders: Say nothing to any man, but let the priest see you and give an offering so that you may be made clean, as the law of Moses says, and for a witness to them. \\n\\n 5:15 [hgb] 但 耶 稣 的 名 声 越 发 传 扬 出 去 。 有 极 多 的 人 聚 集 来 听 道 ， 也 指 望 医 治 他 们 的 病 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But so much the more went there a fame abroad of him: and great multitudes came together to hear, and to be healed by him of their infirmities. \\n\\n [bbe] But news of him went out all the more, in every direction, and great numbers of people came together to give hearing to his words and to be made well from their diseases. \\n\\n 5:16 [hgb] 耶 稣 却 退 到 旷 野 去 祷 告 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he withdrew himself into the wilderness, and prayed. \\n\\n [bbe] But he went away by himself to a waste place for prayer. \\n\\n 5:17 [hgb] 有 一 天 耶 稣 教 训 人 ， 有 法 利 赛 人 和 教 法 师 在 旁 边 坐 着 ， 他 们 是 从 加 利 利 各 乡 村 和 犹 太 并 耶 路 撒 冷 来 的 。 主 的 能 力 与 耶 稣 同 在 ， 使 他 能 医 治 病 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, which were come out of every town of Galilee, and Judaea, and Jerusalem: and the power of the Lord was present to heal them. \\n\\n [bbe] And it came about that on one of these days he was teaching; and some Pharisees and teachers of the law were seated there, who had come from every town of Galilee and Judaea and from Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was with him, to make those who were ill free from their diseases. \\n\\n 5:18 [hgb] 有 人 用 褥 子 抬 着 一 个 瘫 子 ， 要 抬 进 去 放 在 耶 稣 面 前 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him. \\n\\n [bbe] And some men had with them, on a bed, a man who was ill, without power of moving; and they made attempts to get him in and put him before Jesus. \\n\\n 5:19 [hgb] 却 因 人 多 ， 寻 不 出 法 子 抬 进 去 ， 就 上 了 房 顶 ， 从 瓦 间 把 他 连 褥 子 缒 到 当 中 ， 正 在 耶 稣 面 前 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when they could not find by what way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop, and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus. \\n\\n [bbe] And because of the mass of people, there was no way to get him in; so they went up on the top of the house and let him down through the roof, on his bed, into the middle in front of Jesus. \\n\\n 5:20 [hgb] 耶 稣 见 他 们 的 信 心 ， 就 对 瘫 子 说 ， 你 的 罪 赦 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee. \\n\\n [bbe] And seeing their faith he said, Man, you have forgiveness for your sins. \\n\\n 5:21 [hgb] 文 士 和 法 利 赛 人 就 议 论 说 ， 这 说 僭 妄 话 的 是 谁 ？ 除 了 神 以 外 ， 谁 能 赦 罪 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this which speaketh blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone? \\n\\n [bbe] And the scribes and Pharisees were having an argument, saying, Who is this, who has no respect for God? who is able to give forgiveness for sins, but God only? \\n\\n 5:22 [hgb] 耶 稣 知 道 他 们 所 议 论 的 ， 就 说 ， 你 们 心 里 议 论 的 是 什 么 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said unto them, What reason ye in your hearts? \\n\\n [bbe] But Jesus, who had knowledge of their thoughts, said to them, Why are you reasoning in your hearts? \\n\\n 5:23 [hgb] 或 说 ， 你 的 罪 赦 了 ， 或 说 ， 你 起 来 行 走 ， 哪 一 样 容 易 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or to say, Rise up and walk? \\n\\n [bbe] Which is the simpler: to say, You have forgiveness for your sins; or to say, Get up and go? \\n\\n 5:24 [hgb] 但 要 叫 你 们 知 道 人 子 在 地 上 有 赦 罪 的 权 柄 ， 就 对 瘫 子 说 ， 我 吩 咐 你 起 来 ， 拿 你 的 褥 子 回 家 去 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power upon earth to forgive sins, (he said unto the sick of the palsy,) I say unto thee, Arise, and take up thy couch, and go into thine house. \\n\\n [bbe] But so that you may see that on earth the Son of man has authority for the forgiveness of sins, (he said to the man who was ill,) I say to you, Get up, and take up your bed, and go into your house. \\n\\n 5:25 [hgb] 那 人 当 众 人 面 前 ， 立 刻 起 来 ， 拿 着 他 所 躺 卧 的 褥 子 回 家 去 ， 归 荣 耀 与 神 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And immediately he rose up before them, and took up that whereon he lay, and departed to his own house, glorifying God. \\n\\n [bbe] And straight away he got up before them, and took up his bed and went away to his house giving praise to God. \\n\\n 5:26 [hgb] 众 人 都 惊 奇 ， 也 归 荣 耀 与 神 ， 并 且 满 心 惧 怕 ， 说 ， 我 们 今 日 看 见 非 常 的 事 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they were all amazed, and they glorified God, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen strange things to day. \\n\\n [bbe] And wonder overcame them all, and they gave glory to God; and they were full of fear, saying, We have seen strange things today. \\n\\n 5:27 [hgb] 这 事 以 后 ， 耶 稣 出 去 ， 看 见 一 个 税 吏 ， 名 叫 利 未 ， 坐 在 税 关 上 ， 就 对 他 说 ， 你 跟 从 我 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And after these things he went forth, and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he said unto him, Follow me. \\n\\n [bbe] And after these things he went out, and saw Levi, a tax-farmer, seated at the place where taxes were taken, and said to him, Come after me. \\n\\n 5:28 [hgb] 他 就 撇 下 所 有 的 ， 起 来 ， 跟 从 了 耶 稣 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he left all, rose up, and followed him. \\n\\n [bbe] And giving up his business, he got up and went after him. \\n\\n 5:29 [hgb] 利 未 在 自 己 家 里 ， 为 耶 稣 大 摆 筵 席 。 有 许 多 税 吏 和 别 人 ， 与 他 们 一 同 坐 席 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Levi made him a great feast in his own house: and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down with them. \\n\\n [bbe] And Levi made a great feast for him in his house: and a great number of tax-farmers and others were seated at table with them. \\n\\n 5:30 [hgb] 法 利 赛 人 和 文 士 ， 就 向 耶 稣 的 门 徒 发 怨 言 ， 说 ， 你 们 为 什 么 和 税 吏 ， 并 罪 人 ， 一 同 吃 喝 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners? \\n\\n [bbe] And the Pharisees and their scribes made protests against his disciples, saying, Why do you take food and drink with tax-farmers and sinners? \\n\\n 5:31 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 无 病 的 人 用 不 着 医 生 。 有 病 的 人 才 用 得 着 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus answering said unto them, They that are whole need not a physician; but they that are sick. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus, answering, said to them, Those who are well have no need of a medical man, but those who are ill. \\n\\n 5:32 [hgb] 我 来 本 不 是 召 义 人 悔 改 。 乃 是 召 罪 人 悔 改 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. \\n\\n [bbe] I have come, not to get the upright, but sinners, so that they may be turned from their sins. \\n\\n 5:33 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 约 翰 的 门 徒 屡 次 禁 食 祈 祷 ， 法 利 赛 人 的 门 徒 也 是 这 样 。 惟 独 你 的 门 徒 又 吃 又 喝 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often, and make prayers, and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees; but thine eat and drink? \\n\\n [bbe] And they said to him, The disciples of John frequently go without food, and make prayers, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees; but your disciples take food and drink. \\n\\n 5:34 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 新 郎 和 陪 伴 之 人 同 在 的 时 候 ， 岂 能 叫 陪 伴 之 人 禁 食 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And he said unto them, Can ye make the children of the bridechamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus said, Are you able to make the friends of the newly-married man go without food when he is with them? \\n\\n 5:35 [hgb] 但 日 子 将 到 ， 新 郎 要 离 开 他 们 ， 那 日 他 们 就 要 禁 食 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days. \\n\\n [bbe] But the days will come when he will be taken away from them, and then they will go without food. \\n\\n 5:36 [hgb] 耶 稣 又 设 一 个 比 喻 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 没 有 人 把 新 衣 服 撕 下 一 块 来 ， 补 在 旧 衣 服 上 。 若 是 这 样 ， 就 把 新 的 撕 破 了 ， 并 且 所 撕 下 来 的 那 块 新 的 ， 和 旧 的 也 不 相 称 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he spake also a parable unto them; No man putteth a piece of a new garment upon an old; if otherwise, then both the new maketh a rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to them, in a story, No man takes a bit of cloth from a new coat and puts it on to an old coat, for so the new coat would be damaged and the bit from the new would not go well with the old. \\n\\n 5:37 [hgb] 也 没 有 人 把 新 酒 装 在 旧 皮 袋 里 。 若 是 这 样 ， 新 酒 必 将 皮 袋 裂 开 ， 酒 便 漏 出 来 ， 皮 袋 也 就 坏 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; else the new wine will burst the bottles, and be spilled, and the bottles shall perish. \\n\\n [bbe] And no man puts new wine into old wine-skins, for fear that the skins will be burst by the new wine, and the wine be let out, and the skins come to destruction. \\n\\n 5:38 [hgb] 但 新 酒 必 须 装 在 新 皮 袋 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But new wine must be put into new bottles; and both are preserved. \\n\\n [bbe] But new wine has to be put into new wine-skins. \\n\\n 5:39 [hgb] 没 有 人 喝 了 陈 酒 又 想 喝 新 的 ， 他 总 说 陈 的 好 。 \\n\\n [kjv] No man also having drunk old wine straightway desireth new: for he saith, The old is better. \\n\\n [bbe] And no man, having had old wine, has any desire for new, for he says, The old is better. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155/2128.html","bookId":103,"book":{"id":103,"title":"路加福音 Luke","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 大 人 哪 ， 有 好 些 人 提 笔 作 书 ， 述 说 在 我 们 中 间 所 成 就 的 事 ， 是 照 传 道 的 人 ， 从 起 初 亲 眼 看 见 ， 又 传 给 我 们 的 。 [kjv] Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a decla...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
