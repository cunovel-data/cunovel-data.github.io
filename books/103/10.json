Go not from house to house. \n [bbe] And keep in that same house, taking what food and drink they give you: for the worker has a right to his reward. Do not go from house to house. \n 10:8 [hgb] 无 论 进 那 一 城 ， 人 若 接 待 你 们 ， 给 你 们 摆 上 什 么 ， 你 们 就 吃 什 么 。 \n [kjv] And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you: \n [bbe] And into whatever town you go, if they take you in, take whatever food is given to you: \n 10:9 [hgb] 要 医 治 那 城 里 的 病 人 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 神 的 国 临 近 你 们 了 。 \n [kjv] And heal the sick that are therein, and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. \n [bbe] And make well those in it who are ill and say to them, The kingdom of God is near to you. \n 10:10 [hgb] 无 论 进 那 一 城 ， 人 若 不 接 待 你 们 ， 你 们 就 到 街 上 去 ， \n [kjv] But into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you not, go your ways out into the streets of the same, and say, \n [bbe] But if you go into a town where they will not have you, go out into the streets of it and say, \n 10:11 [hgb] 说 ， 就 是 你 们 城 里 的 尘 土 ， 粘 在 我 们 的 脚 上 ， 我 们 也 当 着 你 们 擦 去 。 虽 然 如 此 ， 你 们 该 知 道 神 的 国 临 近 了 。 \n [kjv] Even the very dust of your city, which cleaveth on us, we do wipe off against you: notwithstanding be ye sure of this, that the kingdom of God is come nigh unto you. \n [bbe] Even the dust of your town, which is on our feet, we put off as a witness against you; but be certain of this, that the kingdom of God is near. \n 10:12 [hgb] 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 当 审 判 的 日 子 ， 所 多 玛 所 受 的 ， 比 那 城 还 容 易 受 呢 。 \n [kjv] But I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom, than for that city. \n [bbe] I say to you, It will be better in that day for Sodom than for that town. \n 10:13 [hgb] 哥 拉 汛 哪 ， 你 有 祸 了 。 伯 赛 大 阿 ， 你 有 祸 了 。 因 为 在 你 们 中 间 所 行 的 异 能 ， 若 行 在 推 罗 西 顿 ， 他 们 早 已 披 麻 蒙 灰 坐 在 地 上 悔 改 了 。 \n [kjv] Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon, which have been done in you, they had a great while ago repented, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. \n [bbe] A curse is on you, Chorazin! A curse is on you, Beth-saida! For if such works of power had been done in Tyre and Sidon as have been done in you, they would have been turned from their sins, in days gone by, seated in the dust. \n 10:14 [hgb] 当 审 判 的 日 子 ， 推 罗 西 顿 所 受 的 ， 比 你 们 还 容 易 受 呢 。 \n [kjv] But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment, than for you. \n [bbe] But it will be better for Tyre and Sidon, in the day of judging, than for you. \n 10:15 [hgb] 迦 百 农 阿 ， 你 已 经 升 到 天 上 。 （ 或 作 你 将 要 升 到 天 上 吗 ？ ） 将 来 必 推 下 阴 间 。 \n [kjv] And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell. \n [bbe] And you, Capernaum, were you not lifted up to heaven? you will go down to hell. \n 10:16 [hgb] 又 对 门 徒 说 ， 听 从 你 们 的 ， 就 是 听 从 我 ， 弃 绝 你 们 的 ， 就 是 弃 绝 我 ， 弃 绝 我 的 ， 就 是 弃 绝 那 差 我 来 的 。 \n [kjv] He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me. \n [bbe] Whoever gives ear to you, gives ear to me; and whoever is against you, is against me; and whoever is against me, is against him who sent me. \n 10:17 [hgb] 那 七 十 个 人 欢 欢 喜 喜 地 回 来 说 ， 主 阿 ， 因 你 的 名 ， 就 是 鬼 也 服 了 我 们 。 \n [kjv] And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the devils are subject unto us through thy name. \n [bbe] And the seventy came back with joy, saying, Lord, even the evil spirits are under our power in your name. \n 10:18 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 我 曾 看 见 撒 但 从 天 上 坠 落 ， 像 闪 电 一 样 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven. \n [bbe] And he said, I was watching for Satan, falling from heaven like a star. \n 10:19 [hgb] 我 已 经 给 你 们 权 柄 ， 可 以 践 踏 蛇 和 蝎 子 ， 又 胜 过 仇 敌 一 切 的 能 力 ， 断 没 有 什 么 能 害 你 们 。 \n [kjv] Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you. \n [bbe] See, I have given you power to put your feet on snakes and evil beasts, and over all the strength of him who is against you: and nothing will do you damage. \n 10:20 [hgb] 然 而 不 要 因 鬼 服 了 你 们 就 欢 喜 ， 要 因 你 们 的 名 记 录 在 天 上 欢 喜 。 \n [kjv] Notwithstanding in this rejoice not, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rather rejoice, because your names are written in heaven. \n [bbe] Do not be glad, however, because you have power over spirits, but because your names are recorded in heaven. \n 10:21 [hgb] 正 当 那 时 ， 耶 稣 被 圣 灵 感 动 就 欢 乐 ， 说 ， 父 阿 ， 天 地 的 主 ， 我 感 谢 你 ， 因 为 你 将 这 些 事 ， 向 聪 明 通 达 人 就 藏 起 来 ， 向 婴 孩 就 显 出 来 。 父 阿 ， 是 的 ， 因 为 你 的 美 意 本 是 如 此 。 \n [kjv] In that hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight. \n [bbe] In that same hour he was full of joy in the Holy Spirit and said, I give praise to you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have kept these things secret from the wise and the men of learning, and have made them clear to little children: for so, O Father, it was pleasing in your eyes. \n 10:22 [hgb] 一 切 所 有 的 ， 都 是 我 父 交 付 我 的 。 除 了 父 ， 没 有 人 知 道 子 是 谁 。 除 了 子 和 子 所 愿 意 指 示 的 ， 没 有 人 知 道 父 是 谁 。 \n [kjv] All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knoweth who the Son is, but the Father; and who the Father is, but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him. \n [bbe] All things have been given to me by my Father: and no one has knowledge of the Son, but only the Father: and of the Father, but only the Son, and he to whom the Son will make it clear. \n 10:23 [hgb] 耶 稣 转 身 暗 暗 地 对 门 徒 说 。 看 见 你 们 所 看 见 的 ， 那 眼 睛 就 有 福 了 。 \n [kjv] And he turned him unto his disciples, and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see: \n [bbe] And, turning to the disciples, he said privately, Happy are the eyes which see the things you see: \n 10:24 [hgb] 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 从 前 有 许 多 先 知 和 君 王 ， 要 看 你 们 所 看 的 ， 却 没 有 看 见 。 要 听 你 们 所 听 的 ， 却 没 有 听 见 。 \n [kjv] For I tell you, that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them. \n [bbe] For I say to you that numbers of prophets and kings have had a desire to see the things which you see, and have not seen them, and to have knowledge of the things which have come to your ears, and they had it not. \n 10:25 [hgb] 有 一 个 律 法 师 ， 起 来 试 探 耶 稣 说 ， 夫 子 ， 我 该 作 什 么 才 可 以 承 受 永 生 。 \n [kjv] And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? \n [bbe] And a certain teacher of the law got up and put him to the test, saying, Master, what have I to do so that I may have eternal life? \n 10:26 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 律 法 上 写 的 是 什 么 ？ 你 念 的 是 怎 样 呢 ？ \n [kjv] He said unto him, What is written in the law? how readest thou? \n [bbe] And he said to him, What does the law say, in your reading of it? \n 10:27 [hgb] 他 回 答 说 ， 你 要 尽 心 ， 尽 性 ， 尽 力 ， 尽 意 ， 爱 主 你 的 神 。 又 要 爱 邻 舍 如 同 自 己 。 \n [kjv] And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself. \n [bbe] And he, answering, said, Have love for the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind; and for your neighbour as for yourself. \n 10:28 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 你 回 答 的 是 。 你 这 样 行 ， 就 必 得 永 生 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live. \n [bbe] And he said, You have given the right answer: do this and you will have life. \n 10:29 [hgb] 那 人 要 显 明 自 己 有 理 ， 就 对 耶 稣 说 ， 谁 是 我 的 邻 舍 呢 ？ \n [kjv] But he, willing to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour? \n [bbe] But he, desiring to put himself in the right, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbour? \n 10:30 [hgb] 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 有 一 个 人 从 耶 路 撒 冷 下 耶 利 哥 去 ， 落 在 强 盗 手 中 ， 他 们 剥 去 他 的 衣 裳 ， 把 他 打 个 半 死 ， 就 丢 下 他 走 了 。 \n [kjv] And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead. \n [bbe] And Jesus, answering him, said, A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he got into the hands of thieves, who took his clothing and gave him cruel blows, and when they went away, he was half dead. \n 10:31 [hgb] 偶 然 有 一 个 祭 司 ， 从 这 条 路 下 来 。 看 见 他 就 从 那 边 过 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And by chance there came down a certain priest that way: and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. \n [bbe] And by chance a certain priest was going down that way: and when he saw him, he went by on the other side. \n 10:32 [hgb] 又 有 一 个 利 未 人 ， 来 到 这 地 方 ， 看 见 他 ， 也 照 样 从 那 边 过 去 了 。 \n [kjv] And likewise a Levite, when he was at the place, came and looked on him, and passed by on the other side. \n [bbe] And in the same way, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, went by on the other side. \n 10:33 [hgb] 惟 有 一 个 撒 玛 利 亚 人 ， 行 路 来 到 那 里 。 看 见 他 就 动 了 慈 心 ， \n [kjv] But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him, \n [bbe] But a certain man of Samaria, journeying that way, came where he was, and when he saw him, he was moved with pity for him, \n 10:34 [hgb] 上 前 用 油 和 酒 倒 在 他 的 伤 处 ， 包 裹 好 了 ， 扶 他 骑 上 自 己 的 牲 口 ， 带 到 店 里 去 照 应 他 。 \n [kjv] And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him. \n [bbe] And came to him and put clean linen round his wounds, with oil and wine; and he put him on his beast and took him to a house and took care of him. \n 10:35 [hgb] 第 二 天 拿 出 二 钱 银 子 来 ， 交 给 店 主 说 ， 你 且 照 应 他 。 此 外 所 费 用 的 ， 我 回 来 必 还 你 。 \n [kjv] And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two pence, and gave them to the host, and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatsoever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee. \n [bbe] And the day after he took two pennies and gave them to the owner of the house and said, Take care of him; and if this money is not enough, when I come again I will give you whatever more is needed. \n 10:36 [hgb] 你 想 这 三 个 人 ， 那 一 个 是 落 在 强 盗 手 中 的 邻 舍 呢 ？ \n [kjv] Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? \n [bbe] Which of these three men, in your opinion, was neighbour to the man who came into the hands of thieves? \n 10:37 [hgb] 他 说 ， 是 怜 悯 他 的 。 耶 稣 说 ， 你 去 照 样 行 吧 。 \n [kjv] And he said, He that shewed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise. \n [bbe] And he said, The one who had mercy on him. And Jesus said, Go and do the same. \n 10:38 [hgb] 他 们 走 路 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 进 了 一 个 村 庄 。 有 一 个 女 人 名 叫 马 大 ， 接 他 到 自 己 家 里 。 \n [kjv] Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village: and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house. \n [bbe] Now, while they were on their way, he came to a certain town; and a woman named Martha took him into her house. \n 10:39 [hgb] 她 有 一 个 妹 子 名 叫 马 利 亚 ， 在 耶 稣 脚 前 坐 着 听 他 的 道 。 \n [kjv] And she had a sister called Mary, which also sat at Jesus\u0027 feet, and heard his word. \n [bbe] And she had a sister, by name Mary, who took her seat at the Lord\u0027s feet and gave attention to his words. \n 10:40 [hgb] 马 大 伺 候 的 事 多 ， 心 里 忙 乱 ， 就 进 前 来 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 的 妹 子 留 下 我 一 个 人 伺 候 ， 你 不 在 意 吗 ？ 请 吩 咐 她 来 帮 助 我 。 \n [kjv] But Martha was cumbered about much serving, and came to him, and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. \n [bbe] But Martha had her hands full of the work of the house, and she came to him and said, Lord, is it nothing to you that my sister has let me do all the work? Say to her that she is to give me some help. \n 10:41 [hgb] 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 马 大 ， 马 大 ， 你 为 许 多 的 事 ， 思 虑 烦 扰 。 \n [kjv] And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things: \n [bbe] But the Lord, answering, said to her, Martha, Martha, you are full of care and troubled about such a number of things: \n 10:42 [hgb] 但 是 不 可 少 的 只 有 一 件 。 马 利 亚 已 经 选 择 那 上 好 的 福 分 ， 是 不 能 夺 去 的 。 \n [kjv] But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her. \n [bbe] Little is needed, or even one thing only: for Mary has taken that good part, which will not be taken away from her. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155/2133.html","bookId":103,"book":{"id":103,"title":"路加福音 Luke","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 大 人 哪 ， 有 好 些 人 提 笔 作 书 ， 述 说 在 我 们 中 间 所 成 就 的 事 ， 是 照 传 道 的 人 ， 从 起 初 亲 眼 看 见 ， 又 传 给 我 们 的 。 [kjv] Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a decla...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
