I trow not. \\n\\n [bbe] Does he give praise to the servant because he did what was ordered? \\n\\n 17:10 [hgb] 这 样 ， 你 们 作 完 了 一 切 所 吩 咐 的 ， 只 当 说 ， 我 们 是 无 用 的 仆 人 。 所 作 的 本 是 我 们 应 分 作 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do. \\n\\n [bbe] In the same way, when you have done all the things which are given you to do, say, There is no profit in us, for we have only done what we were ordered to do. \\n\\n 17:11 [hgb] 耶 稣 往 耶 路 撒 冷 去 ， 经 过 撒 玛 利 亚 和 加 利 利 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee. \\n\\n [bbe] And it came about that when they were on the way to Jerusalem he went through Samaria and Galilee. \\n\\n 17:12 [hgb] 进 入 一 个 村 子 ， 有 十 个 长 大 麻 疯 的 迎 面 而 来 ， 远 远 地 站 着 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, which stood afar off: \\n\\n [bbe] And when he went into a certain small town he came across ten men who were lepers, and they, keeping themselves at a distance, \\n\\n 17:13 [hgb] 高 声 说 ， 耶 稣 ， 夫 子 ， 可 怜 我 们 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. \\n\\n [bbe] Said, in loud voices, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us. \\n\\n 17:14 [hgb] 耶 稣 看 见 ， 就 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 去 把 身 体 给 祭 司 察 看 。 他 们 去 的 时 候 就 洁 净 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he saw them, he said unto them, Go shew yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they went, they were cleansed. \\n\\n [bbe] And when he saw them he said, Go, and let the priests see you. And, while they were going, they were made clean. \\n\\n 17:15 [hgb] 内 中 有 一 个 见 自 己 已 经 好 了 ， 就 回 来 大 声 归 荣 耀 与 神 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God, \\n\\n [bbe] And one of them, when he saw that he was clean, turning back, gave praise to God in a loud voice; \\n\\n 17:16 [hgb] 又 俯 伏 在 耶 稣 脚 前 感 谢 他 。 这 人 是 撒 玛 利 亚 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan. \\n\\n [bbe] And, falling down on his face at the feet of Jesus, he gave the credit to him; and he was a man of Samaria. \\n\\n 17:17 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 洁 净 了 的 不 是 十 个 人 吗 ？ 那 九 个 在 哪 里 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine? \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus said, Were there not ten men who were made clean? where are the nine? \\n\\n 17:18 [hgb] 除 了 这 外 族 人 ， 再 没 有 别 人 回 来 归 荣 耀 与 神 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] There are not found that returned to give glory to God, save this stranger. \\n\\n [bbe] Have not any of them come back to give glory to God, but only this one from a strange land? \\n\\n 17:19 [hgb] 就 对 那 人 说 ， 起 来 走 吧 。 你 的 信 救 了 你 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said unto him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee whole. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to him, Get up, and go on your way; your faith has made you well. \\n\\n 17:20 [hgb] 法 利 赛 人 问 神 的 国 几 时 来 到 。 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 神 的 国 来 到 ， 不 是 眼 所 能 见 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation: \\n\\n [bbe] And when the Pharisees put questions to him about when the kingdom of God would come, he gave them an answer and said, The kingdom of God will not come through observation: \\n\\n 17:21 [hgb] 人 也 不 得 说 ， 看 哪 ， 在 这 里 。 看 哪 ， 在 那 里 。 因 为 神 的 国 就 在 你 们 心 里 。 心 里 或 作 中 间 \\n\\n [kjv] Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you. \\n\\n [bbe] And men will not say, See, it is here! or, There! for the kingdom of God is among you. \\n\\n 17:22 [hgb] 他 又 对 门 徒 说 ， 日 子 将 到 ， 你 们 巴 不 得 看 见 人 子 的 一 个 日 子 ， 却 不 得 看 见 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said unto the disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to his disciples, The time will come when you will have a great desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, but you will not see it. \\n\\n 17:23 [hgb] 人 将 要 对 你 们 说 ， 看 哪 ， 在 那 里 ， 看 哪 ， 在 这 里 。 你 们 不 要 出 去 ， 也 不 要 跟 随 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them. \\n\\n [bbe] And if they say to you, See, it is there! or, It is here! do not go away, or go after them. \\n\\n 17:24 [hgb] 因 为 人 子 在 他 降 临 的 日 子 ， 好 像 闪 电 ， 从 天 这 边 一 闪 ， 直 照 到 天 那 边 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For as the lightning, that lighteneth out of the one part under heaven, shineth unto the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day. \\n\\n [bbe] For as in a thunderstorm the bright light is seen from one end of the sky to the other, so will the Son of man be when his time comes. \\n\\n 17:25 [hgb] 只 是 他 必 须 先 受 许 多 苦 ， 又 被 这 世 代 弃 绝 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But first must he suffer many things, and be rejected of this generation. \\n\\n [bbe] But first, he will have to undergo much and be put on one side by this generation. \\n\\n 17:26 [hgb] 挪 亚 的 日 子 怎 样 ， 人 子 的 日 子 也 要 怎 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And as it was in the days of Noe, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man. \\n\\n [bbe] And as it was in the days of Noah, so will it be in the day of the Son of man. \\n\\n 17:27 [hgb] 那 时 候 的 人 又 吃 又 喝 ， 又 娶 又 嫁 ， 到 挪 亚 进 方 舟 的 那 日 ， 洪 水 就 来 ， 把 他 们 全 都 灭 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They did eat, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noe entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all. \\n\\n [bbe] They were feasting and taking wives and getting married, till the day of the overflowing of the waters, when Noah went into the ark, and they all came to destruction. \\n\\n 17:28 [hgb] 又 好 像 罗 得 的 日 子 。 人 又 吃 又 喝 ， 又 买 又 卖 ， 又 耕 种 ， 又 盖 造 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded; \\n\\n [bbe] In the same way, in the days of Lot; they were feasting and trading, they were planting and building; \\n\\n 17:29 [hgb] 到 罗 得 出 所 多 玛 的 那 日 ， 就 有 火 与 硫 磺 从 天 上 降 下 来 ， 把 他 们 全 都 灭 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all. \\n\\n [bbe] But on the day when Lot went out of Sodom, fire came down from heaven and destruction came on them all. \\n\\n 17:30 [hgb] 人 子 显 现 的 日 子 ， 也 要 这 样 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed. \\n\\n [bbe] So will it be in the day of the revelation of the Son of man. \\n\\n 17:31 [hgb] 当 那 日 ， 人 在 房 上 ， 器 具 在 屋 里 ， 不 要 下 来 拿 。 人 在 田 里 ， 也 不 要 回 家 。 \\n\\n [kjv] In that day, he which shall be upon the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back. \\n\\n [bbe] On that day, if anyone is on the roof of the house, and his goods are in the house, let him not go down to take them away; and let him who is in the field not go back to his house. \\n\\n 17:32 [hgb] 你 们 要 回 想 罗 得 的 妻 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Remember Lot\u0027s wife. \\n\\n [bbe] Keep in mind Lot\u0027s wife. \\n\\n 17:33 [hgb] 凡 想 要 保 全 生 命 的 ， 必 丧 掉 生 命 。 凡 丧 掉 生 命 的 ， 必 救 活 生 命 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it. \\n\\n [bbe] If anyone makes an attempt to keep his life, it will be taken from him, but if anyone gives up his life, he will keep it. \\n\\n 17:34 [hgb] 我 对 你 们 说 ， 当 那 一 夜 ， 两 个 人 在 一 个 床 上 。 要 取 去 一 个 ， 撇 下 一 个 。 \\n\\n [kjv] I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left. \\n\\n [bbe] I say to you, In that night there will be two men sleeping in one bed, and one will be taken away and the other let go. \\n\\n 17:35 [hgb] 两 个 女 人 一 同 推 磨 。 要 取 去 一 个 ， 撇 下 一 个 。 有 古 卷 在 此 有 \\n\\n [kjv] Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left. \\n\\n [bbe] Two women will be crushing grain together; one will be taken away and the other let go. \\n\\n 17:36 [hgb] 两 个 人 在 田 里 要 取 去 一 个 撇 下 一 个 \\n\\n [kjv] Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left. \\n\\n [bbe] [] \\n\\n 17:37 [hgb] 门 徒 说 ， 主 阿 ， 在 哪 里 有 这 事 呢 ？ 耶 稣 说 ， 尸 首 在 哪 里 ， 鹰 也 必 聚 在 哪 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Wheresoever the body is, thither will the eagles be gathered together. \\n\\n [bbe] And they, answering him, said, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Where the body is, there will the eagles come together. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155/2140.html","bookId":103,"book":{"id":103,"title":"路加福音 Luke","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 大 人 哪 ， 有 好 些 人 提 笔 作 书 ， 述 说 在 我 们 中 间 所 成 就 的 事 ， 是 照 传 道 的 人 ， 从 起 初 亲 眼 看 见 ， 又 传 给 我 们 的 。 [kjv] Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a decla...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
