And in those days he did eat nothing: and when they were ended, he afterward hungered. \\n\\n [bbe] For forty days, being tested by the Evil One. And he had no food in those days; and when they came to an end, he was in need of food. \\n\\n 4:3 [hgb] 魔 鬼 对 他 说 ， 你 若 是 神 的 儿 子 ， 可 以 吩 咐 这 块 石 头 变 成 食 物 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the devil said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Evil One said to him, If you are the Son of God, give orders to this stone to become bread. \\n\\n 4:4 [hgb] 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 经 上 记 着 说 ， 人 活 着 不 是 单 靠 食 物 ， 乃 是 靠 神 口 里 所 出 的 一 切 话 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus made answer to him, It has been said in the Writings, Bread is not man\u0027s only need. \\n\\n 4:5 [hgb] 魔 鬼 又 领 他 上 了 高 山 ， 霎 时 间 把 天 下 的 万 国 都 指 给 他 看 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. \\n\\n [bbe] And he took him up and let him see all the kingdoms of the earth in a minute of time. \\n\\n 4:6 [hgb] 对 他 说 ， 这 一 切 权 柄 荣 华 ， 我 都 要 给 你 。 因 为 这 原 是 交 付 我 的 ， 我 愿 意 给 谁 就 给 谁 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Evil One said, I will give you authority over all these, and the glory of them, for it has been given to me, and I give it to anyone at my pleasure. \\n\\n 4:7 [hgb] 你 若 在 我 面 前 下 拜 ， 这 都 要 归 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine. \\n\\n [bbe] If then you will give worship to me, it will all be yours. \\n\\n 4:8 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 经 上 记 着 说 ， 当 拜 主 你 的 神 ， 单 要 事 奉 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus in answer said to him, It has been said in the Writings, Give worship to the Lord your God, and be his servant only. \\n\\n 4:9 [hgb] 魔 鬼 又 领 他 到 耶 路 撒 冷 去 ， 叫 他 站 在 殿 顶 上 ， （ 顶 原 文 作 翅 ） 对 他 说 ， 你 若 是 神 的 儿 子 ， 可 以 从 这 里 跳 下 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence: \\n\\n [bbe] And he took him to Jerusalem and put him on the highest point of the Temple and said to him, If you are the Son of God, let yourself go down from here; for it is said in the Writings, \\n\\n 4:10 [hgb] 因 为 经 上 记 着 说 ， 主 要 为 你 吩 咐 他 的 使 者 保 护 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee: \\n\\n [bbe] He will give his angels orders to take care of you: \\n\\n 4:11 [hgb] 他 们 要 用 手 托 着 你 ， 免 得 你 的 脚 碰 在 石 头 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone. \\n\\n [bbe] And, In their hands they will keep you up, so that your foot may not be crushed against a stone. \\n\\n 4:12 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 经 上 说 ， 不 可 试 探 主 你 的 神 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus made answer and said to him, It is said in the Writings, You may not put the Lord your God to the test. \\n\\n 4:13 [hgb] 魔 鬼 用 完 了 各 样 的 试 探 ， 就 暂 时 离 开 耶 稣 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a season. \\n\\n [bbe] And when all these tests were ended the Evil One went away from him for a time. \\n\\n 4:14 [hgb] 耶 稣 满 有 圣 灵 的 能 力 回 到 加 利 利 ， 他 的 名 声 就 传 遍 了 四 方 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee: and there went out a fame of him through all the region round about. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus came back to Galilee in the power of the Spirit, and the news of him went through all the country round about. \\n\\n 4:15 [hgb] 他 在 各 会 堂 里 教 训 人 ， 众 人 都 称 赞 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all. \\n\\n [bbe] And he was teaching in their Synagogues and all men gave him praise. \\n\\n 4:16 [hgb] 耶 稣 来 到 拿 撒 勒 ， 就 是 他 长 大 的 地 方 。 在 安 息 日 ， 照 他 平 常 的 规 矩 ， 进 了 会 堂 ， 站 起 来 要 念 圣 经 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read. \\n\\n [bbe] And he came to Nazareth, where he had been as a child, and he went, as his way was, into the Synagogue on the Sabbath, and got up to give a reading. \\n\\n 4:17 [hgb] 有 人 把 先 知 以 赛 亚 的 书 交 给 他 ， 他 就 打 开 ， 找 到 一 处 写 着 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, \\n\\n [bbe] And the book of the prophet Isaiah was given to him and, opening the book, he came on the place where it is said, \\n\\n 4:18 [hgb] 主 的 灵 在 我 身 上 ， 因 为 他 用 膏 膏 我 ， 叫 我 传 福 音 给 贫 穷 的 人 。 差 遣 我 报 告 被 掳 的 得 释 放 ， 瞎 眼 的 得 看 见 ， 叫 那 受 压 制 的 得 自 由 ， \\n\\n [kjv] The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, \\n\\n [bbe] The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because I am marked out by him to give good news to the poor; he has sent me to make well those who are broken-hearted; to say that the prisoners will be let go, and the blind will see, and to make the wounded free from their chains, \\n\\n 4:19 [hgb] 报 告 神 悦 纳 人 的 禧 年 。 \\n\\n [kjv] To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. \\n\\n [bbe] To give knowledge that the year of the Lord\u0027s good pleasure is come. \\n\\n 4:20 [hgb] 于 是 把 书 卷 起 来 ， 交 还 执 事 ， 就 坐 下 。 会 堂 里 的 人 都 定 睛 看 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him. \\n\\n [bbe] And shutting the book he gave it back to the servant and took his seat: and the eyes of all in the Synagogue were fixed on him. \\n\\n 4:21 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 今 天 这 经 应 验 在 你 们 耳 中 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he began to say unto them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears. \\n\\n [bbe] Then he said to them, Today this word has come true in your hearing. \\n\\n 4:22 [hgb] 众 人 都 称 赞 他 ， 并 希 奇 他 口 中 所 出 的 恩 言 。 又 说 ， 这 不 是 约 瑟 的 儿 子 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph\u0027s son? \\n\\n [bbe] And they were all giving witness, with wonder, to the words of grace which came from his mouth: and they said, Is not this the son of Joseph? \\n\\n 4:23 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 必 引 这 俗 语 向 我 说 ， 医 生 ， 你 医 治 自 己 吧 。 我 们 听 见 你 在 迦 百 农 所 行 的 事 ， 也 当 行 在 你 自 己 家 乡 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to them, Without doubt you will say to me, Let the medical man make himself well: the things which to our knowledge were done at Capernaum, do them here in your country. \\n\\n 4:24 [hgb] 又 说 ， 我 实 在 告 诉 你 们 ， 没 有 先 知 在 自 己 家 乡 被 人 悦 纳 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to them, Truly I say to you, No prophet is honoured in his country. \\n\\n 4:25 [hgb] 我 对 你 们 说 实 话 ， 当 以 利 亚 的 时 候 ， 天 闭 塞 了 三 年 零 六 个 月 ， 遍 地 有 大 饥 荒 ， 那 时 ， 以 色 列 中 有 许 多 寡 妇 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land; \\n\\n [bbe] Truly I say to you, There were a number of widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up for three years and six months and there was no food in the land; \\n\\n 4:26 [hgb] 以 利 亚 并 没 有 奉 差 往 他 们 一 个 人 那 里 去 ， 只 奉 差 往 西 顿 的 撒 勒 法 ， 一 个 寡 妇 那 里 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. \\n\\n [bbe] But Elijah was not sent to one of them, but only to Zarephath, in the land of Sidon, to a woman who was a widow. \\n\\n 4:27 [hgb] 先 知 以 利 沙 的 时 候 ， 以 色 列 中 有 许 多 长 大 麻 疯 的 。 但 内 中 除 了 叙 利 亚 国 的 乃 缦 ， 没 有 一 个 得 洁 净 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and none of them was cleansed, saving Naaman the Syrian. \\n\\n [bbe] And there were a number of lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and not one of them was made clean, but only Naaman the Syrian. \\n\\n 4:28 [hgb] 会 堂 里 的 人 听 见 这 话 ， 都 怒 气 满 胸 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath, \\n\\n [bbe] And all who were in the Synagogue were very angry when these things were said to them. \\n\\n 4:29 [hgb] 就 起 来 撵 他 出 城 ， 他 们 的 城 造 在 山 上 ， 他 们 带 他 到 山 崖 ， 要 把 他 推 下 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down headlong. \\n\\n [bbe] And they got up and took him out of the town to the edge of the mountain on which their town was, so that they might send him down to his death. \\n\\n 4:30 [hgb] 他 却 从 他 们 中 间 直 行 ， 过 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But he passing through the midst of them went his way, \\n\\n [bbe] But he came through them and went on his way. \\n\\n 4:31 [hgb] 耶 稣 下 到 迦 百 农 ， 就 是 加 利 利 的 一 座 城 ， 在 安 息 日 教 训 众 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days. \\n\\n [bbe] And he came down to Capernaum, a town of Galilee; and he was giving them teaching on the Sabbath. \\n\\n 4:32 [hgb] 他 们 很 希 奇 他 的 教 训 ， 因 为 他 的 话 里 有 权 柄 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power. \\n\\n [bbe] And they were surprised at his teaching, for his word was with authority. \\n\\n 4:33 [hgb] 在 会 堂 里 有 一 个 人 ， 被 污 鬼 的 精 气 附 着 ， 大 声 喊 叫 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice, \\n\\n [bbe] And there was a man in the Synagogue who had an unclean spirit; and he gave a loud cry and said, \\n\\n 4:34 [hgb] 唉 ， 拿 撒 勒 的 耶 稣 ， 我 们 与 你 有 什 么 相 干 ， 你 来 灭 我 们 吗 ？ 我 知 道 你 是 谁 ， 乃 是 神 的 圣 者 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art; the Holy One of God. \\n\\n [bbe] Let us be! what have we to do with you, Jesus of Nazareth? have you come to put an end to us? I have knowledge who you are, the Holy One of God. \\n\\n 4:35 [hgb] 耶 稣 责 备 他 说 ， 不 要 作 声 ， 从 这 人 身 上 出 来 吧 。 鬼 把 那 人 摔 倒 在 众 人 中 间 ， 就 出 来 了 ， 却 也 没 有 害 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. And when the devil had thrown him in the midst, he came out of him, and hurt him not. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus said to him, Be quiet, and come out of him. And when the evil spirit had put him down on the earth in the middle of them, he came out of him, having done him no damage. \\n\\n 4:36 [hgb] 众 人 都 惊 讶 ， 彼 此 对 问 说 ， 这 是 什 么 道 理 呢 ？ 因 为 他 用 权 柄 能 力 吩 咐 污 鬼 ， 污 鬼 就 出 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they were all amazed, and spake among themselves, saying, What a word is this! for with authority and power he commandeth the unclean spirits, and they come out. \\n\\n [bbe] And wonder came on them all and they said to one another, What are these words? for with authority and power he gives orders to the evil spirits and they come out. \\n\\n 4:37 [hgb] 于 是 耶 稣 的 名 声 传 遍 了 周 围 地 方 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the fame of him went out into every place of the country round about. \\n\\n [bbe] And there was much talk about him in all the places round about. \\n\\n 4:38 [hgb] 耶 稣 出 了 会 堂 ， 进 了 西 门 的 家 。 西 门 的 岳 母 害 热 病 甚 重 。 有 人 为 她 求 耶 稣 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon\u0027s house. And Simon\u0027s wife\u0027s mother was taken with a great fever; and they besought him for her. \\n\\n [bbe] And he got up and went out of the Synagogue and went into the house of Simon. And Simon\u0027s wife\u0027s mother was very ill with a burning heat; and in answer to their prayers for her \\n\\n 4:39 [hgb] 耶 稣 站 在 她 旁 边 ， 斥 责 那 热 病 ， 热 就 退 了 。 她 立 刻 起 来 服 事 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he stood over her, and rebuked the fever; and it left her: and immediately she arose and ministered unto them. \\n\\n [bbe] He went near her, and with a sharp word he gave orders to the disease and it went away from her; and straight away she got up and took care of their needs. \\n\\n 4:40 [hgb] 日 落 的 时 候 ， 凡 有 病 人 的 ， 不 论 害 什 么 病 ， 都 带 到 耶 稣 那 里 。 耶 稣 按 手 在 他 们 各 人 身 上 ， 医 好 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them unto him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them. \\n\\n [bbe] And at sundown all those who had anyone ill with any sort of disease, took them to him, and he put his hands on every one of them and made them well. \\n\\n 4:41 [hgb] 又 有 鬼 从 好 些 人 身 上 出 来 ， 喊 着 说 ， 你 是 神 的 儿 子 。 耶 稣 斥 责 他 们 ， 不 许 他 们 说 话 ， 因 为 他 们 知 道 他 是 基 督 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And devils also came out of many, crying out, and saying, Thou art Christ the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak: for they knew that he was Christ. \\n\\n [bbe] And evil spirits came out of a number of them, crying out and saying, You are the Son of God. But he gave them sharp orders not to say a word, because they had knowledge that he was the Christ. \\n\\n 4:42 [hgb] 天 亮 的 时 候 ， 耶 稣 出 来 ， 走 到 旷 野 地 方 。 众 人 去 找 他 ， 到 了 他 那 里 ， 要 留 住 他 ， 不 要 他 离 开 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place: and the people sought him, and came unto him, and stayed him, that he should not depart from them. \\n\\n [bbe] And when it was day, he came out and went to a waste place; and great numbers of people came looking for him, and they came to him and would have kept him from going away. \\n\\n 4:43 [hgb] 但 耶 稣 对 他 们 说 ， 我 也 必 须 在 别 城 传 神 国 的 福 音 。 因 我 奉 差 原 是 为 此 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also: for therefore am I sent. \\n\\n [bbe] But he said to them, I have to give the good news of the kingdom of God in other towns, because that is why I was sent. \\n\\n 4:44 [hgb] 于 是 耶 稣 在 加 利 利 的 各 会 堂 传 道 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee. \\n\\n [bbe] And he was teaching in the Synagogues of Galilee. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155/2127.html","bookId":103,"book":{"id":103,"title":"路加福音 Luke","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 大 人 哪 ， 有 好 些 人 提 笔 作 书 ， 述 说 在 我 们 中 间 所 成 就 的 事 ， 是 照 传 道 的 人 ， 从 起 初 亲 眼 看 见 ， 又 传 给 我 们 的 。 [kjv] Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a decla...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
