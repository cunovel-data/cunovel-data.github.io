And he took him, and healed him, and let him go; \\n\\n [bbe] But they said nothing. And he made him well and sent him away. \\n\\n 14:5 [hgb] 便 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 中 间 谁 有 驴 或 有 牛 ， 在 安 息 日 掉 在 井 里 ， 不 立 时 拉 他 上 来 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day? \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to them, Which of you, whose ox or ass has got into a water-hole, will not straight away get him out on the Sabbath? \\n\\n 14:6 [hgb] 他 们 不 能 对 答 这 话 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they could not answer him again to these things. \\n\\n [bbe] And they had no answer to that question. \\n\\n 14:7 [hgb] 耶 稣 见 所 请 的 客 拣 择 首 位 ， 就 用 比 喻 对 他 们 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And he put forth a parable to those which were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the chief rooms; saying unto them, \\n\\n [bbe] And he gave teaching in the form of a story to the guests who came to the feast, when he saw how they took the best seats; saying to them, \\n\\n 14:8 [hgb] 你 被 人 请 去 赴 婚 姻 的 筵 席 ， 不 要 坐 在 首 位 上 。 恐 怕 有 比 你 尊 贵 的 客 ， 被 他 请 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When thou art bidden of any man to a wedding, sit not down in the highest room; lest a more honourable man than thou be bidden of him; \\n\\n [bbe] When you get a request to come to a feast, do not take the best seat, for a more important man than you may be coming, \\n\\n 14:9 [hgb] 那 请 你 们 的 人 前 来 对 你 说 ， 让 座 给 这 一 位 吧 。 你 就 羞 羞 惭 惭 地 退 到 末 位 上 去 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he that bade thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place; and thou begin with shame to take the lowest room. \\n\\n [bbe] And then the giver of the feast will come to you and say, Give your place to this man; and you, with shame, will have to take the lowest seat. \\n\\n 14:10 [hgb] 你 被 请 的 时 候 ， 就 去 坐 在 末 位 上 ， 好 叫 那 请 你 的 人 来 ， 对 你 说 ， 朋 友 ， 请 上 坐 ， 那 时 你 在 同 席 的 人 面 前 ， 就 有 光 彩 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room; that when he that bade thee cometh, he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher: then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them that sit at meat with thee. \\n\\n [bbe] But when you come, go and take the lowest seat, so that when the giver of the feast comes, he may say to you, Friend, come up higher; and then you will have honour in the eyes of all the others who are there. \\n\\n 14:11 [hgb] 因 为 凡 自 高 的 必 降 为 卑 。 自 卑 的 必 升 为 高 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. \\n\\n [bbe] For every man who gives himself a high place will be put down, but he who takes a low place will be lifted up. \\n\\n 14:12 [hgb] 耶 稣 又 对 请 他 的 人 说 ， 你 摆 设 午 饭 ， 或 晚 饭 ， 不 要 请 你 的 朋 友 ， 弟 兄 ， 亲 属 ， 和 富 足 的 邻 舍 。 恐 怕 他 们 也 请 你 ， 你 就 得 了 报 答 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then said he also to him that bade him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends, nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen, nor thy rich neighbours; lest they also bid thee again, and a recompence be made thee. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to the master of the house, When you give a feast, do not send for your friends and your brothers and your family or your neighbours who have wealth, for they may give a feast for you, and so you will get a reward. \\n\\n 14:13 [hgb] 你 摆 设 筵 席 ， 倒 要 请 那 贫 穷 的 ， 残 废 的 ， 瘸 腿 的 ， 瞎 眼 的 ， 你 就 有 福 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But when thou makest a feast, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind: \\n\\n [bbe] But when you give a feast, send for the poor and the blind and those who are broken in body: \\n\\n 14:14 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 没 有 什 么 可 报 答 你 。 到 义 人 复 活 的 时 候 ， 你 要 得 着 报 答 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And thou shalt be blessed; for they cannot recompense thee: for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just. \\n\\n [bbe] And you will have a blessing, because they will not be able to give you any payment, and you will get your reward when the upright come back from the dead. \\n\\n 14:15 [hgb] 同 席 的 有 一 人 听 见 这 话 ， 就 对 耶 稣 说 ， 在 神 国 里 吃 饭 的 有 福 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when one of them that sat at meat with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God. \\n\\n [bbe] And, hearing these words, one of those who were at table with him said to him, Happy is the man who will be a guest in the kingdom of God. \\n\\n 14:16 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 有 一 人 摆 设 大 筵 席 ， 请 了 许 多 客 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many: \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to them, A certain man gave a great feast, and sent word of it to a number of people. \\n\\n 14:17 [hgb] 到 了 坐 席 的 时 候 ， 打 发 仆 人 去 对 所 请 的 人 说 ， 请 来 吧 。 样 样 都 齐 备 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden, Come; for all things are now ready. \\n\\n [bbe] And when the time had come, he sent his servants to say to them, Come, for all things are now ready. \\n\\n 14:18 [hgb] 众 人 一 口 同 音 地 推 辞 。 头 一 个 说 ， 我 买 了 一 块 地 ， 必 须 去 看 看 。 请 你 准 我 辞 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a piece of ground, and I must needs go and see it: I pray thee have me excused. \\n\\n [bbe] And they all gave reasons why they were not able to come. The first said to him, I have got a new field, and it is necessary for me to go and see it: I am full of regret that I am unable to come. \\n\\n 14:19 [hgb] 又 有 一 个 说 ， 我 买 了 五 对 牛 ， 要 去 试 一 试 。 请 你 准 我 辞 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them: I pray thee have me excused. \\n\\n [bbe] And another said, I have got some cattle, and I am going to make a test of them: I am full of regret that I am unable to come. \\n\\n 14:20 [hgb] 又 有 一 个 说 ， 我 才 娶 了 妻 ， 所 以 不 能 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. \\n\\n [bbe] And another said, I have been married, and so I am not able to come. \\n\\n 14:21 [hgb] 那 仆 人 回 来 ， 把 这 事 都 告 诉 了 主 人 。 家 主 就 动 怒 ， 对 仆 人 说 ， 快 出 去 到 城 里 大 街 小 巷 ， 领 那 贫 穷 的 ， 残 废 的 ， 瞎 眼 的 ， 瘸 腿 的 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So that servant came, and shewed his lord these things. Then the master of the house being angry said to his servant, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind. \\n\\n [bbe] And the servant came back and gave his master an account of these things. Then the master of the house was angry and said to the servant, Go out quickly into the streets of the town and get the poor, the blind, and those who are broken in body. \\n\\n 14:22 [hgb] 仆 人 说 ， 主 阿 ， 你 所 吩 咐 的 已 经 办 了 ， 还 有 空 座 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the servant said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room. \\n\\n [bbe] And the servant said, Lord, your orders have been done, and still there is room. \\n\\n 14:23 [hgb] 主 人 对 仆 人 说 ， 你 出 去 到 路 上 和 篱 笆 那 里 ， 勉 强 人 进 来 ， 坐 满 我 的 屋 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the lord said unto the servant, Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled. \\n\\n [bbe] And the lord said to the servant, Go out into the roads and the fields, and make them come in, so that my house may be full. \\n\\n 14:24 [hgb] 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 先 前 所 请 的 人 ， 没 有 一 个 得 尝 我 的 筵 席 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For I say unto you, That none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper. \\n\\n [bbe] For I say to you that not one of those who were requested to come will have a taste of my feast. \\n\\n 14:25 [hgb] 有 极 多 的 人 和 耶 稣 同 行 。 他 转 过 来 对 他 们 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And there went great multitudes with him: and he turned, and said unto them, \\n\\n [bbe] Now a great number of people went with him. \\n\\n 14:26 [hgb] 人 到 我 这 里 来 ， 若 不 爱 我 胜 过 爱 自 己 的 父 母 ， 妻 子 ， 儿 女 ， 弟 兄 ， 姐 妹 ， 和 自 己 的 性 命 ， 就 不 能 作 我 的 门 徒 。 爱 我 胜 过 爱 原 文 作 恨 \\n\\n [kjv] If any man come to me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disciple. \\n\\n [bbe] And turning round, he said to them, If any man comes to me, and has not hate for his father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and even for his life, he may not be my disciple. \\n\\n 14:27 [hgb] 凡 不 背 着 自 己 十 字 架 跟 从 我 的 ， 也 不 能 作 我 的 门 徒 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, cannot be my disciple. \\n\\n [bbe] Whoever does not take up his cross and come after me may not be my disciple. \\n\\n 14:28 [hgb] 你 们 哪 一 个 要 盖 一 座 楼 ， 不 先 坐 下 算 计 花 费 ， 能 盖 成 不 能 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] For which of you, intending to build a tower, sitteth not down first, and counteth the cost, whether he have sufficient to finish it? \\n\\n [bbe] For which of you, desiring to put up a tower, does not first give much thought to the price, if he will have enough to make it complete? \\n\\n 14:29 [hgb] 恐 怕 安 了 地 基 ， 不 能 成 功 ， 看 见 的 人 都 笑 话 他 ， \\n\\n [kjv] Lest haply, after he hath laid the foundation, and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him, \\n\\n [bbe] For fear that if he makes a start and is not able to go on with it to the end, all who see it will be laughing at him, \\n\\n 14:30 [hgb] 说 ， 这 个 人 开 了 工 ， 却 不 能 完 工 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish. \\n\\n [bbe] And saying, This man made a start at building and is not able to make it complete. \\n\\n 14:31 [hgb] 或 是 一 个 王 ， 出 去 和 别 的 王 打 仗 ， 岂 不 先 坐 下 酌 量 ， 能 用 一 万 兵 ， 去 敌 那 领 二 万 兵 来 攻 打 他 的 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Or what king, going to make war against another king, sitteth not down first, and consulteth whether he be able with ten thousand to meet him that cometh against him with twenty thousand? \\n\\n [bbe] Or what king, going to war with another king, will not first take thought if he will be strong enough, with ten thousand men, to keep off him who comes against him with twenty thousand? \\n\\n 14:32 [hgb] 若 是 不 能 ， 就 趁 敌 人 还 远 的 时 候 ， 派 使 者 去 求 和 息 的 条 款 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sendeth an ambassage, and desireth conditions of peace. \\n\\n [bbe] Or while the other is still a great distance away, he sends representatives requesting conditions of peace. \\n\\n 14:33 [hgb] 这 样 ， 你 们 无 论 什 么 人 ， 若 不 撇 下 一 切 所 有 的 ， 就 不 能 作 我 的 门 徒 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So likewise, whosoever he be of you that forsaketh not all that he hath, he cannot be my disciple. \\n\\n [bbe] And so whoever is not ready to give up all he has may not be my disciple. \\n\\n 14:34 [hgb] 盐 本 是 好 的 ， 盐 若 失 了 味 ， 可 用 什 么 叫 它 再 咸 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] Salt is good: but if the salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be seasoned? \\n\\n [bbe] For salt is good, but if the taste goes from it, of what use is it? \\n\\n 14:35 [hgb] 或 用 在 田 里 ， 或 堆 在 粪 里 ， 都 不 合 式 。 只 好 丢 在 外 面 。 有 耳 可 听 的 ， 就 应 当 听 。 \\n\\n [kjv] It is neither fit for the land, nor yet for the dunghill; but men cast it out. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. \\n\\n [bbe] It is no good for the land or for the place of waste; no one has a use for it. He who has ears, let him give ear. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155/2137.html","bookId":103,"book":{"id":103,"title":"路加福音 Luke","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 大 人 哪 ， 有 好 些 人 提 笔 作 书 ， 述 说 在 我 们 中 间 所 成 就 的 事 ， 是 照 传 道 的 人 ， 从 起 初 亲 眼 看 见 ， 又 传 给 我 们 的 。 [kjv] Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a decla...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
