{"id":2557,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"7:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 百 姓 讲 完 了 这 一 切 的 话 ， 就 进 了 迦 百 农 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now when he had ended all his sayings in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum. \\n\\n [bbe] After he had come to the end of all his words in the hearing of the people, he went into Capernaum. \\n\\n 7:2 [hgb] 有 一 个 百 夫 长 所 宝 贵 的 仆 人 ， 害 病 快 要 死 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And a certain centurion\u0027s servant, who was dear unto him, was sick, and ready to die. \\n\\n [bbe] And a certain captain had a servant who was very dear to him; this servant was ill and near to death. \\n\\n 7:3 [hgb] 百 夫 长 风 闻 耶 稣 的 事 ， 就 托 犹 太 人 的 几 个 长 老 ， 去 求 耶 稣 来 救 他 的 仆 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant. \\n\\n [bbe] And when news of Jesus came to his ears, he sent to him rulers of the Jews, requesting that he would come and make his servant well. \\n\\n 7:4 [hgb] 他 们 到 了 耶 稣 那 里 ， 就 切 切 地 求 他 说 ， 你 给 他 行 这 事 ， 是 他 所 配 得 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he was worthy for whom he should do this: \\n\\n [bbe] And they, when they came to Jesus, made their request warmly, saying, \\n\\n 7:5 [hgb] 因 为 他 爱 我 们 的 百 姓 ， 给 我 们 建 造 会 堂 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For he loveth our nation, and he hath built us a synagogue. \\n\\n [bbe] It is right for you to do this for him, because he is a friend to our nation, and himself has put up a Synagogue for us. \\n\\n 7:6 [hgb] 耶 稣 就 和 他 们 同 去 。 离 那 家 不 远 ， 百 夫 长 托 几 个 朋 友 去 见 耶 稣 ， 对 他 说 ， 主 阿 ， 不 要 劳 动 。 因 你 到 我 舍 下 ， 我 不 敢 当 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof: \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus went with them. And when he was not far from the house, the man sent friends to him, saying, Lord, do not give yourself trouble: for I am not important enough for you to come into my house: \\n\\n 7:7 [hgb] 我 也 自 以 为 不 配 去 见 你 ， 只 要 你 说 一 句 话 ， 我 的 仆 人 就 必 好 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Wherefore neither thought I myself worthy to come unto thee: but say in a word, and my servant shall be healed. \\n\\n [bbe] And I had the feeling that I was not even good enough to come to you: but say the word only, and my servant will be well. \\n\\n 7:8 [hgb] 因 为 我 在 人 的 权 下 ， 也 有 兵 在 我 以 下 ， 对 这 个 说 去 ， 他 就 去 。 对 那 个 说 来 ， 他 就 来 。 对 我 的 仆 人 说 ， 你 作 这 事 ， 他 就 去 作 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For I also am a man set under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. \\n\\n [bbe] For I, myself, am a man under authority, having men under me; and I say to this one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it. \\n\\n 7:9 [hgb] 耶 稣 听 见 这 话 ， 就 希 奇 他 ， 转 身 对 跟 随 的 众 人 说 ， 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 这 么 大 的 信 心 ， 就 是 在 以 色 列 中 我 也 没 有 遇 见 过 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him, and turned him about, and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no, not in Israel. \\n\\n [bbe] And when these things were said to Jesus, he was surprised, and, turning to the mass of people coming after him, said, I have not seen such great faith, no, not in Israel. \\n\\n 7:10 [hgb] 那 托 来 的 人 回 到 百 夫 长 家 里 ， 看 见 仆 人 已 经 好 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they that were sent, returning to the house, found the servant whole that had been sick. \\n\\n [bbe] And when those who were sent came back to the house they saw that the servant was well. \\n\\n 7:11 [hgb] 过 了 不 多 时 ， 有 古 卷 作 次 日 耶 稣 往 一 座 城 去 ， 这 城 名 叫 拿 因 ， 他 的 门 徒 和 极 多 的 人 与 他 同 行 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass the day after, that he went into a city called Nain; and many of his disciples went with him, and much people. \\n\\n [bbe] And it came about, after a little time, that he went to a town named Nain; and his disciples went with him, and a great number of people. \\n\\n 7:12 [hgb] 将 近 城 门 ， 有 一 个 死 人 被 抬 出 来 。 这 人 是 他 母 亲 独 生 的 儿 子 ， 他 母 亲 又 是 寡 妇 。 有 城 里 的 许 多 人 同 着 寡 妇 送 殡 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now when he came nigh to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow: and much people of the city was with her. \\n\\n [bbe] Now when he came near the door of the town, a dead man was being taken out, the only son of his mother, who was a widow: and a great number of people from the town were with her. \\n\\n 7:13 [hgb] 主 看 见 那 寡 妇 就 怜 悯 她 ， 对 她 说 ， 不 要 哭 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her, and said unto her, Weep not. \\n\\n [bbe] And when the Lord saw her, he had pity on her and said to her, Be not sad. \\n\\n 7:14 [hgb] 于 是 进 前 按 着 杠 ， 抬 的 人 就 站 住 了 。 耶 稣 说 ， 少 年 人 ， 我 吩 咐 你 起 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he came and touched the bier: and they that bare him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. \\n\\n [bbe] And he came near, and put his hand on the stretcher where the dead man was: and those who were moving it came to a stop. And he said, Young man, I say to you, Get up. \\n\\n 7:15 [hgb] 那 死 人 就 坐 起 ， 并 且 说 话 。 耶 稣 便 把 他 交 给 他 母 亲 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he that was dead sat up, and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother. \\n\\n [bbe] And the dead man got up, and words came from his lips. And he gave him to his mother. \\n\\n 7:16 [hgb] 众 人 都 惊 奇 ， 归 荣 耀 与 神 说 ， 有 大 先 知 在 我 们 中 间 兴 起 来 了 。 又 说 ， 神 眷 顾 了 他 的 百 姓 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God hath visited his people. \\n\\n [bbe] And fear came on all, and they gave praise to God, saying, A great prophet is among us: and, God has given thought to his people. \\n\\n 7:17 [hgb] 他 这 事 的 风 声 就 传 遍 了 犹 太 ， 和 周 围 地 方 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And this rumour of him went forth throughout all Judaea, and throughout all the region round about. \\n\\n [bbe] And this story about him went through all Judaea and the places round about. \\n\\n 7:18 [hgb] 约 翰 的 门 徒 把 这 些 事 都 告 诉 约 翰 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the disciples of John shewed him of all these things. \\n\\n [bbe] And the disciples of John gave him an account of all these things. \\n\\n 7:19 [hgb] 他 便 叫 了 两 个 门 徒 来 ， 打 发 他 们 到 主 那 里 去 ， 说 ， 那 将 要 来 的 是 你 吗 ？ 还 是 我 们 等 候 别 人 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? \\n\\n [bbe] Then John sent two of his disciples to the Lord, saying, Are you he who is to come, or are we waiting for another? \\n\\n 7:20 [hgb] 那 两 个 人 来 到 耶 稣 那 里 ， 说 ， 施 洗 的 约 翰 打 发 我 们 来 问 你 ， 那 将 要 来 的 是 你 吗 ？ 还 是 我 们 等 候 别 人 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] When the men were come unto him, they said, John Baptist hath sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another? \\n\\n [bbe] And when the men came to him they said, John the Baptist has sent us to you, saying, Are you he who is to come, or are we waiting for another? \\n\\n 7:21 [hgb] 正 当 那 时 候 ， 耶 稣 治 好 了 许 多 有 疾 病 的 ， 受 灾 患 的 ， 被 恶 鬼 附 着 的 。 又 开 恩 叫 好 些 瞎 子 能 看 见 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto many that were blind he gave sight. \\n\\n [bbe] At that time, he made a number of people free from their diseases and their pains, and from evil spirits; and to others who were blind he gave back the use of their eyes. \\n\\n 7:22 [hgb] 耶 稣 回 答 说 ， 你 们 去 把 所 看 见 所 听 见 的 事 告 诉 约 翰 。 就 是 瞎 子 看 见 ， 瘸 子 行 走 ， 长 大 麻 疯 的 洁 净 ， 聋 子 听 见 ， 死 人 复 活 ， 穷 人 有 福 音 传 给 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go your way, and tell John what things ye have seen and heard; how that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached. \\n\\n [bbe] And answering them he said, Go back and give news to John of what you have seen, and the things which have come to your ears; the blind now see, those who had no power in their legs are walking, lepers are made clean, those who had no hearing now have their ears open, dead men come to life again, and the poor have the good news given to them. \\n\\n 7:23 [hgb] 凡 不 因 我 跌 倒 的 ， 就 有 福 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me. \\n\\n [bbe] And a blessing will be on him who has no doubts about me. \\n\\n 7:24 [hgb] 约 翰 所 差 来 的 人 既 走 了 ， 耶 稣 就 对 众 人 讲 论 约 翰 说 ， 你 们 从 前 出 去 到 旷 野 ， 是 要 看 什 么 呢 ？ 要 看 风 吹 动 的 芦 苇 吗 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness for to see? A reed shaken with the wind? \\n\\n [bbe] And when the men who were sent by John had gone away, he said to the people, about John, What did you go out into the waste land to see? a tall stem moving in the wind? \\n\\n 7:25 [hgb] 你 们 出 去 到 底 是 要 看 什 么 ？ 要 看 穿 细 软 衣 服 的 人 吗 ？ 那 穿 华 丽 衣 服 宴 乐 度 日 的 人 ， 是 在 王 宫 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, they which are gorgeously apparelled, and live delicately, are in kings\u0027 courts. \\n\\n [bbe] But what did you go out to see? a man in soft clothing? See now, those who have beautiful clothing and delicate food are in kings\u0027 houses. \\n\\n 7:26 [hgb] 你 们 出 去 究 竟 是 要 看 什 么 ？ 要 看 先 知 吗 ？ 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 是 的 ， 他 比 先 知 大 多 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet. \\n\\n [bbe] But what did you go out to see? a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet. \\n\\n 7:27 [hgb] 经 上 记 着 说 ， 我 要 差 遣 我 的 使 者 在 你 前 面 ， 预 备 道 路 。 所 说 的 就 是 这 个 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee. \\n\\n [bbe] This is he of whom it has been said, See, I send my servant before your face, who will make ready your way before you. \\n\\n 7:28 [hgb] 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 凡 妇 人 所 生 的 ， 没 有 一 个 大 过 约 翰 的 。 然 而 神 国 里 最 小 的 比 他 还 大 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist: but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. \\n\\n [bbe] I say to you, Among all the sons of women, not one is greater than John: but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he. \\n\\n 7:29 [hgb] 众 百 姓 和 税 吏 ， 既 受 过 约 翰 的 洗 ， 听 见 这 话 ， 就 以 神 为 义 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John. \\n\\n [bbe] (And all the people, and the tax-farmers, to whom John had given baptism, when they had knowledge of these things, gave glory to God. \\n\\n 7:30 [hgb] 但 法 利 赛 人 和 律 法 师 ， 没 有 受 过 约 翰 的 洗 ， 竟 为 自 己 废 弃 了 神 的 旨 意 。 （ 二 十 九 三 十 两 节 或 作 众 百 姓 和 税 吏 听 见 了 约 翰 的 话 就 受 了 他 的 洗 便 以 神 为 义 但 法 利 赛 人 和 律 法 师 不 受 约 翰 的 洗 ， 竟 为 自 己 废 弃 了 神 的 旨 意 。 ） \\n\\n [kjv] But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him. \\n\\n [bbe] But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were against the purpose of God for themselves, not having had his baptism.) \\n\\n 7:31 [hgb] 主 又 说 ， 这 样 ， 我 可 用 什 么 比 这 世 代 的 人 呢 ？ 他 们 好 像 什 么 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And the Lord said, Whereunto then shall I liken the men of this generation? and to what are they like? \\n\\n [bbe] What comparison am I to make of the men of this generation? what are they like? \\n\\n 7:32 [hgb] 好 像 孩 童 坐 在 街 市 上 ， 彼 此 呼 叫 说 ， 我 们 向 你 们 吹 笛 ， 你 们 不 跳 舞 ， 我 们 向 你 们 举 哀 ， 你 们 不 啼 哭 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace, and calling one to another, and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept. \\n\\n [bbe] They are like children who are seated in the market-place, crying out to one another, and saying, We made music for you, but you did not take part in the dance; we gave cries of sorrow, but you were not sad. \\n\\n 7:33 [hgb] 施 洗 的 约 翰 来 ， 不 吃 饼 ， 不 喝 酒 。 你 们 说 他 是 被 鬼 附 着 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine; and ye say, He hath a devil. \\n\\n [bbe] For John the Baptist came, taking no food or drink, and you say, He has an evil spirit. \\n\\n 7:34 [hgb] 人 子 来 ， 也 吃 也 喝 。 你 们 说 他 是 贪 食 好 酒 的 人 ， 是 税 吏 和 罪 人 的 朋 友 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The Son of man is come eating and drinking; and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners! \\n\\n [bbe] The Son of man came feasting, and you say, Here is a lover of food and wine, a friend of tax-farmers and sinners. \\n\\n 7:35 [hgb] 但 智 慧 之 子 ， 都 以 智 慧 为 是 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But wisdom is justified of all her children. \\n\\n [bbe] But wisdom is judged to be right by all her children. \\n\\n 7:36 [hgb] 有 一 个 法 利 赛 人 ， 请 耶 稣 和 他 吃 饭 。 耶 稣 就 到 法 利 赛 人 家 里 去 坐 席 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee\u0027s house, and sat down to meat. \\n\\n [bbe] And one of the Pharisees made a request that he would take a meal with him. And he went into the Pharisee\u0027s house and took his seat at the table. \\n\\n 7:37 [hgb] 那 城 里 有 一 个 女 人 ， 是 个 罪 人 。 知 道 耶 稣 在 法 利 赛 人 家 里 坐 席 ， 就 拿 着 盛 香 膏 的 玉 瓶 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee\u0027s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment, \\n\\n [bbe] And there was a woman in the town who was a sinner; and when she had news that he was a guest in the Pharisee\u0027s house, she took a bottle of perfume, \\n\\n 7:38 [hgb] 站 在 耶 稣 背 后 ， 挨 着 他 的 脚 哭 ， 眼 泪 湿 了 耶 稣 的 脚 ， 就 用 自 己 的 头 发 擦 干 ， 又 用 嘴 连 连 亲 他 的 脚 ， 把 香 膏 抹 上 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment. \\n\\n [bbe] And went in and took her place at the back of him, near his feet, weeping, so that his feet were washed with the drops from her eyes, and with her hair she made them dry, and kissing his feet she put the perfume on them. \\n\\n 7:39 [hgb] 请 耶 稣 的 法 利 赛 人 看 见 这 事 ， 心 里 说 ， 这 人 若 是 先 知 ， 必 知 道 摸 他 的 是 谁 ， 是 个 怎 样 的 女 人 ， 乃 是 个 罪 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner. \\n\\n [bbe] Now when the Pharisee in whose house he was saw it, he said to himself, This man, if he was a prophet, would be conscious what sort of woman this is who has put her hands on him, that she is a sinner. \\n\\n 7:40 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 他 说 ， 西 门 ， 我 有 句 话 要 对 你 说 。 西 门 说 ， 夫 子 ， 请 说 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on. \\n\\n [bbe] And Jesus, answering, said, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he said, Master, say on. \\n\\n 7:41 [hgb] 耶 稣 说 ， 一 个 债 主 ， 有 两 个 人 欠 他 的 债 。 一 个 欠 五 十 两 银 子 ， 一 个 欠 五 两 银 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said, Two men were in debt to a certain man of business: one had a debt of five hundred pence, and the other of fifty. \\n\\n 7:42 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 无 力 偿 还 ， 债 主 就 开 恩 免 了 他 们 两 个 人 的 债 。 这 两 个 人 哪 一 个 更 爱 他 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most? \\n\\n [bbe] When they were unable to make payment, he made the two of them free of their debts. Which of them, now, will have the greater love for him? \\n\\n 7:43 [hgb] 西 门 回 答 说 ， 我 想 是 那 多 得 恩 免 的 人 。 耶 稣 说 ， 你 断 的 不 错 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged. \\n\\n [bbe] Simon, in answer, said, It seems he whose debt was greater. And he said, Your decision is right. \\n\\n 7:44 [hgb] 于 是 转 过 来 向 着 那 女 人 ， 便 对 西 门 说 ， 你 看 见 这 女 人 吗 ？ 我 进 了 你 的 家 ， 你 没 有 给 我 水 洗 脚 。 但 这 女 人 用 眼 泪 湿 了 我 的 脚 ， 用 头 发 擦 干 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head. \\n\\n [bbe] And turning to the woman he said to Simon, You see this woman? I came into your house; you did not give me water for my feet: but she has been washing my feet with the drops from her eyes, and drying them with her hair. \\n\\n 7:45 [hgb] 你 没 有 与 我 亲 嘴 ， 但 这 女 人 从 我 进 来 的 时 候 ， 就 不 住 地 用 嘴 亲 我 的 脚 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet. \\n\\n [bbe] You did not give me a kiss: but she, from the time when I came in, has gone on kissing my feet. \\n\\n 7:46 [hgb] 你 没 有 用 油 抹 我 的 头 ， 但 这 女 人 用 香 膏 抹 我 的 脚 。 \\n\\n [kjv] My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment. \\n\\n [bbe] You put no oil on my head: but she has put perfume on my feet. \\n\\n 7:47 [hgb] 所 以 我 告 诉 你 ， 他 许 多 的 罪 都 赦 免 了 。 因 为 他 的 爱 多 。 但 那 赦 免 少 的 ， 他 的 爱 就 少 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little. \\n\\n [bbe] And so I say to you, She will have forgiveness for her sins which are great in number, because of her great love: but he who has small need of forgiveness gives little love. \\n\\n 7:48 [hgb] 于 是 对 那 女 人 说 ， 你 的 罪 赦 免 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to her, You have forgiveness for your sins. \\n\\n 7:49 [hgb] 同 席 的 人 心 里 说 ， 这 是 什 么 人 ， 竟 赦 免 人 的 罪 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also? \\n\\n [bbe] And those who were seated at table with him said to themselves, Who is this who even gives forgiveness of sins? \\n\\n 7:50 [hgb] 耶 稣 对 那 女 人 说 ， 你 的 信 救 了 你 ， 平 平 安 安 地 回 去 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to the woman, By your faith you have salvation; go in peace. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155/2130.html","bookId":103,"book":{"id":103,"title":"路加福音 Luke","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 提 阿 非 罗 大 人 哪 ， 有 好 些 人 提 笔 作 书 ， 述 说 在 我 们 中 间 所 成 就 的 事 ， 是 照 传 道 的 人 ， 从 起 初 亲 眼 看 见 ， 又 传 给 我 们 的 。 [kjv] Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a decla...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/155","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:16 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:33 AM"}}
