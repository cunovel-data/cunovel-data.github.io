{"id":95258,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"I couldn\u0027t tell my mother about my mysterious invitation to the Mansion. She\u0027d say no, I couldn\u0027t go. I\u0027d say yes, I could. She\u0027d ground me; I\u0027d run away. It would all be very dramatic. I was certain nothing could stop me from going, until my dad dropped a bomb on the morning of December 1. \"I\u0027m taking Mom to Vegas tonight!\" he said, pulling me aside. \"It\u0027s all very spur-of-the-moment. We\u0027re flying out this afternoon.\" \"Isn\u0027t that romantic?\" My mom beamed, grabbing a suitcase from the hall closet. \"Your father\u0027s never done anything like this for our anniversary!\" \"So you\u0027ll be in charge of the house and watching Billy,\" my dad ordered. \"Watch Billy? He\u0027s eleven!\" I yelled, following them into their bedroom. \"Here\u0027s where we can be reached if you have any problems,\" he said, handing me a slip of paper with a phone number. \"Your employment at Janice\u0027s proved to me you can be responsible. We\u0027ll be back tomorrow after dinner.\" \"But I have plans!\" \"So invite Becky over here tonight.\" He tossed a hairbrush into his travel bag. \"You\u0027re always going to her house. But pick out a movie you all can enjoy.\" \"Becky? That\u0027s the only friend you think I have? Like all I do with my life is watch TV?\" \"Paul, should I take this?\" my mom interrupted, holding a red strapless dress. \"I\u0027m sixteen, Dad. I want to go out on a Saturday night!\" \"I know,\" my mom said, placing a pair of red stilettos in her bag. \"But not tonight. Your father\u0027s just surprised me! He hasn\u0027t done that since college. Just this once, Raven, then you can have all the Saturdays you want.\" She kissed me on the head, not waiting for a response. \"I\u0027ll be calling in at midnight sharp,\" my father warned, \"just to make sure you and Billy are getting along and that my tennis racket is still in the closet.\" \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027m not going to throw a wild party,\" I said angrily. \"Good, I might have to use the house as collateral at the blackjack table.\" He went into his closet and pulled a jacket out. I went into my room and pulled my hair out. In all the seventeen years my parents had been married, my dad had to pick tonight to surprise my mom? It was seven-thirty that night when I broke the news to Nerd Boy--rather, Billy Boy. I was wearing my Saturday-night best: a black spandex sleeveless mini-dress with a black lacy undertop that peeked through, black tights, unscuffed combat boots, black lipstick, and silver-and-onyx earrings. \"I\u0027m going out tonight.\" \"But you\u0027re supposed to stay here.\" He ogled my outfit like a protective father. \"You have a date!\" \"I do not. I just have to go.\" \"You can\u0027t! I won\u0027t let you. I\u0027ll tell.\" Billy Boy would have loved to stay by himself, but he loved his sudden power over me more. \"Becky\u0027s coming over to hang with you. You like Becky.\" \"Yeah, but does she like me?\" \"She loves you!\" \"Really?\" he asked, with crush-boy eyes. \"I\u0027ll ask her when she gets here. Becky, do you love my little eleven-year-old brother?\" \"Don\u0027t! You better not!\" \"Then promise to behave.\" \"I\u0027m going to tell. You\u0027re leaving me! Anything can happen. I could be on the internet and meet some crazy psycho woman that wants to marry me.\" \"You could only be so lucky,\" I said, looking out the window for Becky. \"You\u0027ll get in so much trouble!\" \"Quit being a baby! Show Becky your computer games. She\u0027ll go mad over that alien spaceship stuff.\" \"If you leave, I\u0027ll call them in Vegas.\" \"Not if you value your life. I\u0027ll tie you to that chair if I have to!\" \"Then do it, \u0027cause I\u0027m going to call!\" He ran for the cordless phone. \"Billy, please,\" I begged. \"I really need to go. Someday you\u0027ll understand. Please, Billy.\" He paused with the phone in his hand. He had never heard me beg him for anything, only threaten. \"Well, okay, just make sure you\u0027ll be here by midnight. I\u0027m not going to pretend you\u0027re in the bathroom.\" For the first time I can remember, I gave my brother a hug. And I gave him a real hug, a Ruby squeeze-hug, the kind that lets you really feel the other person\u0027s warmth. \"Where\u0027s Becky already!\" he yelled, now playing for my team. \"You need to leave!\" Suddenly the doorbell rang and we both flew down the steps. \"Where were you?\" I asked. Becky sauntered in with a box of microwave popcorn. \"I thought you said eight.\" \"I have to be there at eight!\" \"Shoot, and I thought I was early. Take the truck,\" she said, handing me her keys. \"Thanks. How do I look?\" I asked, modeling my outfit. \"Wicked!\" \"Really? Thanks!\" \"You look like an angel of the night,\" my baby brother added. I glanced in the hallway mirror and smiled. It might be the last time I would actually be able to see my reflection. \"Have fun, you two, and take good care of Billy, okay?\" \"Who?\" she asked, puzzled. \"Billy. My brother.\" They both laughed. I grabbed my jacket and flew out of there like a bat. Some hideous Dullsvillians had spray-painted GO HOME FREAKS! on the crumbling brick wall by the Mansion gate. It could have been Trevor. It could have been anyone. I felt an emptiness in my stomach. I guess the Sterlings didn\u0027t get many visitors--there was no buzzer on the gate. Was I supposed to wait there, or climb over? But then I realized the gate was open. For me. I walked up the long driveway, looking at the curtained attic window, hoping I would be able to finally see it from the inside. Anything could happen tonight. I really didn\u0027t know what to expect. What would we be eating for dinner? What do vampires eat anyway? I gently rapped the serpent knocker. The huge door slowly opened and Creepy Man greeted me with his crackly smile. \"So glad you could come,\" he said in his thick European accent, straight out of a black-and-white horror flick. \"May I take your coat?\" He took my leather jacket somewhere. I stood in the hallway, peering for signs of anything that seemed threatening. Where was my dinner partner anyway? \"Alexander will be joining you in a few minutes,\" Creepy said, returning. \"Would you like to sit in the drawing room until he comes down?\" \"Sure,\" I agreed, and was led to a huge room next to the living room. It was decorated simply with two scarlet Victorian chairs and a chaise longue. The only thing that didn\u0027t look dusty and old was the baby grand piano in the corner. Creepy Man left again and I took the opportunity to snoop around. There were leather-bound books in some foreign language, dusty music scores, and old crinkly maps, and this wasn\u0027t even their library. I caressed the smooth oak desk. What secrets lay inside its drawers? Then I felt that same unseen presence I had felt the last time I visited the Mansion. Alexander had come into the room. He stood, mysteriously handsome. His hair was sleek and he wore a silk black shirt hanging over black jeans. I was anxious to see if he was wearing the spider ring, but he held his hands behind his back. \"I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m late. I was waiting for the baby-sitter,\" I confessed. \"You have a baby?\" \"No, a brother!\" \"Right,\" he said with an awkward laugh, his pale face coming to life. He was even more handsome than Trevor but didn\u0027t come off as self-assured, more like a wounded bird that needed to be held. As if he\u0027d been living in a dungeon all his life and this was the first time he\u0027d seen another human. He seemed uncomfortable with conversation and chose his words carefully, as if once spoken he might never get them back. \"I\u0027m sorry I kept you waiting,\" he began. \"I was getting you these.\" And he timidly held out five wildflowers. Flowers? No way! \"Those are for me?\" I was completely overwhelmed. It was like everything moved in slow motion. I took the flowers from him, softly touching his hands in the process. The spider ring caught my eye. \"I\u0027ve never gotten flowers before. They\u0027re the most beautiful flowers I\u0027ve ever seen.\" \"You must have a hundred boyfriends,\" he said, glancing down at his boots. \"I can\u0027t believe they\u0027ve never given you flowers.\" \"When I turned thirteen my grandmother sent me a bouquet of tulips in a plastic yellow pot.\" As dumb as it sounded, it was better than saying, \"I\u0027ve never gotten flowers from my hundred boyfriends, because I\u0027ve never had one boyfriend!\" \"Flowers from grandmothers are very special,\" he replied strangely. \"But why five?\" \"One for every time I saw you.\" \"I had nothing to do with the spray paint--\" Creepy Man appeared. \"Dinner is ready. Shall I put those in some water, miss?\" \"Please,\" I said, though I didn\u0027t want to part with them. \"Thank you, Jameson,\" Alexander said. Alexander waited for me to exit the room first, straight out of a Cary Grant movie, but I was unsure which way to go. \"I thought you\u0027d know the way,\" he teased. \"Would you like something to drink?\" \"Sure, anything.\" Wait a minute--anything? So I said, \"Actually, water will be great!\" He returned a moment later with two crystal goblets. \"I hope you\u0027re hungry.\" \"I\u0027m always hungry,\" I flirted. \"And you?\" \"Rarely hungry,\" he said. \"But always thirsty!\" He led me into the candlelit dining room, dominated by a long uncovered oak table set with ceramic plates and silver utensils. He pulled out my chair, then sat a million miles away at the other end of the table. The five wildflowers stood in a crystal vase blocking my view. Creepy Man--I mean, Jameson--wheeled in a creaky cart and presented me with a basket of steamy rolls. He returned with crystal bowls filled with a greenish soup. Considering the number of courses, the slowness of Jameson\u0027s service and the length of the table, we were guaranteed to be here for months. But I didn\u0027t care, I didn\u0027t want to be anywhere else in the world. \"It\u0027s Hungarian goulash,\" Alexander stated as I nervously stirred the pasty soup. I had no idea what--or who--was in it, and as Alexander and Jameson waited for my reaction, I realized I\u0027d have to taste it. \"Yum!\" I exclaimed, slurping down half a spoonful. It was way more delicious than any soup I\u0027d ever eaten from a can, but one hundred times as spicy! My tongue was on fire and I immediately chugged down my water. \"I hope it\u0027s not too spicy,\" Alexander said. \"Spicy?\" I gasped, my eyes bursting. \"You\u0027ve got to be joking!\" Alexander motioned for Jameson to bring more water. It seemed like an eternity, but he returned with a pitcher. Eventually I got my breath back. I didn\u0027t know what to ask Alexander, but I wanted to know everything about him. I could tell Alexander had fewer friends than I. He seemed uncomfortable in his own skin. \"What do you do all day?\" I inquired like a TV reporter breaking the ice. \"I wanted to know the same thing about you,\" he offered. \"I go to school. What do you do?\" \"Sleep.\" \"You sleep?\" This was major news! \"Really?\" I asked skeptically. \"Is there something wrong with that?\" he said, awkwardly brushing his hair from his eyes. \"Well, most people sleep at night.\" \"I\u0027m not most people.\" \"True...\" \"And you\u0027re not either,\" he said, staring at me with his soulful eyes. \"I could tell when I saw you on Halloween dressed as a tennis player. You seemed a little too old to trick-or-treat. And you had to be different to think that was a costume.\" \"How did you get my info?\" \"Jameson was supposed to return the tennis racket to you but gave it to a blond soccer player who said he was your boyfriend. I might have bought the story if I hadn\u0027t seen you smack his hand and drive off without him.\" \"Well, you\u0027re right, he\u0027s not my boyfriend. He\u0027s a totally lamoid jerk at school.\" \"But fortunately he also told Jameson your name and address to back up his story. That\u0027s how I knew how to find you. I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d find you exploring the house again.\" His dreamy eyes stared right through me. \"Well...I...\" Our laughter echoed in the Mansion. \"Where are your parents?\" I asked. \"Romania.\" \"Romania? Isn\u0027t Romania where Dracula lived?\" I inquired, hinting. \"Yes.\" My eyes lit up. \"Are you related to Dracula?\" I asked. \"He never came to a family reunion,\" he teased in an anxious voice. \"You\u0027re a wacky girl. You certainly give life to Dullsville.\" \"Dullsville? No way! That\u0027s what I call this town!\" \"Well, what else could we call it? There isn\u0027t any nightlife here, is there? Not for people like me and you.\" Nightlife. People like me and you. You mean vampires, I wanted to say. \"I preferred living in New York and London,\" he went on. \"I bet there\u0027s a lot to do there at night. And a lot of night people.\" Just then Jameson came to take the goulash away and served us steak. \"I hope you\u0027re not a vegetarian,\" he said. I peered down at my dinner. The steak was medium rare, more on the rare side, as the juice spilled onto the plate and into the mashed potatoes. He was so mysterious, and funnier than I could have imagined. I was under his spell as I peered at him through the flowers. \"I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll be delicious,\" I said. He watched as I took a bite. \"Yum, once again.\" Suddenly he looked at me with sad eyes. \"Listen, do you mind--\" He picked up his plate and walked over to me. \"All I can see are the wildflowers, and after all, you\u0027re much prettier.\" He set his plate next to mine and dragged his oak chair over. I thought I would faint. He sat smiling as we ate, his leg softly touching mine. My body was electrified. Alexander was funny, gorgeous, and awkward in a sexy way. I wanted to know his whole life story. No matter how many years he had lived, seventeen or seventeen hundred. \"What do you do at night? Where else have you lived? Why don\u0027t you go to school?\" I rattled on suddenly. \"Slow down.\" \"Um...where were you born?\" \"Romania.\" \"Then where\u0027s your Romanian accent?\" \"In Romania. We traveled constantly.\" \"Have you ever gone to school?\" \"No, I\u0027ve always had a private tutor.\" \"What\u0027s your favorite color?\" \"Black.\" I remembered Mrs. Peevish. I paused and asked, \"What do you want to be when you grow up?\" \"You mean I\u0027m not grown up?\" \"That\u0027s a question, not an answer,\" I said coyly. \"What do you want to be?\" he asked. I stared into his deep, dark mysterious eyes and whispered, \"A vampire.\" He stared at me curiously and seemed disturbed. And then he laughed. \"You are a riot!\" Then he looked at me sharply. \"Raven, why did you sneak into the house?\" I looked away, embarrassed. Jameson wheeled over some pastry on a cart. He lit a match and flames rose around the dessert. \"Flamb\u0026#65533;!\" he announced. And just in time. Alexander extinguished our desserts and told Jameson we would finish our dinner outside. \"I hope you aren\u0027t afraid of the dark,\" he said, leading me into the dilapidated gazebo. \"Afraid? I live for it!\" \"Me, too,\" he said, smiling. \"It\u0027s really the only way to see the stars properly.\" He lit a half-melted candle on the ledge. \"Do you bring all your girlfriends here?\" I asked, fingering the used candle. \"Yes.\" He laughed. \"And I read to them by candlelight. What would you like?\" he asked, pointing to a stack of textbooks on the floor. \"Functions and Logarithms or Minority Group Cultures?\" I laughed. \"The moon is so beautiful tonight,\" he said, staring out the gazebo. \"Makes me think of werewolves. Do you think a man can change into an animal?\" \"If he\u0027s with the right girl,\" he said with a laugh. I moved closer to him. The moonlight softly lit his face. He was beautiful. Kiss me, Alexander. Kiss me now! I thought, closing my eyes. \"But we have all of eternity,\" he suddenly said. \"For now let\u0027s enjoy the stars.\" He placed his dessert bowl on the ledge and blew out the candle, and I quickly grabbed his hand. It wasn\u0027t a Trevor hand or a skinny Billy Boy hand. He had the best hand in the whole world! We lay down on the cold grass and gazed up at the stars, holding hands. We relaxed in silence, our hands warming together. I could feel the prickly legs of the spider ring. I wanted to kiss. But he just stared up at the stars. \"Who are your friends?\" I asked, turning to him. \"I keep to myself.\" \"I bet you met tons of cool girls before you moved here.\" \"Cool is one thing. The kind of girls who accept you for who you really are is another. I\u0027d like something...lasting.\" Lasting? For eternity? But I couldn\u0027t ask that. \"I want a relationship I can finally sink my teeth into.\" Really? Well, I\u0027m your girl! I thought. But he didn\u0027t turn toward me; instead, Alexander gazed at the sky. \"So you don\u0027t have any friends here?\" I asked, trying to pump him for more info. \"Just one.\" \"Jameson?\" \"Someone who wears black lipstick.\" We both stared up at the moon in silence. I beamed from his compliment. \"Who do you hang out with?\" he finally asked. \"Becky is the only one who accepts me, and it\u0027s because I\u0027m the only one who doesn\u0027t beat her up.\" We both laughed. \"Everyone else thinks I\u0027m weird.\" \"I don\u0027t.\" \"Really?\" No one had ever said that to me in my whole life. No one. \"You seem a lot like me,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t gawk at me like I\u0027m a freak.\" \"I\u0027ll kick anyone who does.\" \"I think you already did. Or at least smacked him with a racket.\" We laughed in the moonlight, and I placed my free arm on his chest and hugged him, as my Gothic Mate softly stroked my arm. \"Could those be ravens?\" I asked, pointing to a flurry of dark wings circling high above the Mansion. \"Those aren\u0027t birds--they\u0027re bats.\" \"Bats! I\u0027ve never seen bats around here, until you moved in.\" \"Yeah, we found some hanging in the attic. Jameson set them free. I hope they don\u0027t frighten you. They\u0027re wonderful creatures.\" \"It takes one to know one, right?\" I hinted. \"But don\u0027t worry. They never swoop down and get tangled in jet-black hair like yours. Only in mall hair.\" \"They like hairspray?\" \"They hate it. They know mall hair looks terrible!\" I laughed, and he began softly stroking my hair. His touch calmed me. I thought I was going to melt into the earth. He was certainly taking much more time than Trevor had. I began stroking his hair, which was silky from his gel. \"Do bats like gel?\" I asked. \"They love the way it looks with a silk Armani,\" he teased back. I wriggled over him and pinned his arms down. He looked up at me with surprise and smiled. I waited for him to kiss me. But he didn\u0027t move. Of course, he didn\u0027t move--I was pinning him down! What was I thinking? \"Tell me your favorite thing about bats, Bat Girl,\" he asked, as I anxiously stared down at him. \"They can fly.\" \"You want to fly?\" I nodded. He wrestled me over and pinned my arms down. Again I waited for him to kiss me, but he didn\u0027t. He just stared into my eyes. \"So what\u0027s your favorite thing about bats, Bat Boy?\" I asked. \"I\u0027d have to say,\" he began, thinking, \"their vampire teeth.\" I gasped, but it wasn\u0027t because of Alexander\u0027s comment. A mosquito had bitten my neck. \"Don\u0027t be afraid,\" he said, squeezing my hand. \"I won\u0027t bite...yet.\" He laughed at his joke. \"I\u0027m not afraid. A mosquito bit me!\" I explained, scratching like mad. He examined the mark like a doctor. \"It\u0027s starting to swell. We\u0027d better get you ice.\" \"It\u0027ll be okay. I get these all the time.\" \"I don\u0027t want you to tell your parents you came over to my house and got bitten!\" I wanted to tell the whole world I was bitten, but that mosquito had ruined everything. He took me into the kitchen and put ice on my tiny wound. I listened to the grandfather clock chime away. Nine...Chime...Ten...Chime. No! Eleven...Chime. Frig! Twelve. It couldn\u0027t be! \"I\u0027ve got to go!\" I exclaimed. \"So soon?\" he asked, disappointed. \"Any second my dad will be calling from Vegas, and if I\u0027m not there to answer, I\u0027ll be grounded for eternity!\" If only I could stay and live with Alexander in his attic room and have Creepy Man serve me Count Chocula cereal every morning... \"Thanks for the flowers and the dinner and the stars,\" I said hurriedly by Becky\u0027s truck, scrambling in my purse for the keys. \"Thank you for coming.\" He looked dreamy and gorgeous, and somehow lonely. I wanted my Gothic Vampire Mate to kiss me now. I wanted his mouth on my neck and his soul within mine. \"Raven?\" he said cautiously. \"Yes?\" \"Would you like me to...\" \"Yes? Yes?\" \"Would you like me to...invite you again, or would you rather sneak back in?\" \"I\u0027d love to be invited,\" I answered, waiting. If he kissed me now, we\u0027d be bonded for all eternity. \"Wonderful then. I\u0027ll call you.\" He kissed me softly on the cheek. The cheek? Still, it was softer and more romantic than the time Jack Patterson had kissed me outside the Mansion, and much more romantic than Trevor pushing me against a tree. And as much as I wanted a real kiss--a vampire kiss--he was changing me. I was transforming into a swooning noodle-legged, goopy, googly-eyed, drippy marshmallow girl. I could still feel his lovely, full lips against my face as I drove home. My body tingled all over with excitement, longing, passion-- feelings I had never felt about a guy before. And as I scratched the bite that wasn\u0027t his, I could only hope I wouldn\u0027t turn into a blood- sucking mosquito. \"Dad\u0027s explaining to Becky the rules of blackjack,\" Billy whispered anxiously, as I ran through the door. \"He\u0027s already told her about every casino and the history of Siegfried and Roy. He\u0027s running out of hotels on the strip!\" I whispered, \"Thanks,\" to Becky and quickly grabbed the phone. \"Becky loves to talk,\" my dad began. \"I had no idea she was so fascinated with Las Vegas. Next time I\u0027ll bring her. She tells me you guys have been watching vampire movies all evening.\" \"Yeah...\" \"Revenge of Dracula for the fiftieth time?\" \"No. It\u0027s a new one. It\u0027s called Vampire Kisses.\" \"Is it good?\" \"I give it two thumbs up!\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-kisses-vampire-kisses-1/page-15.html","bookId":2137,"book":{"id":2137,"title":"Vampire Kisses (Vampire Kisses #1)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Kisses (Vampire Kisses #1) A new guy in town.Rumors of vampires.
