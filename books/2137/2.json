{"id":95245,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"The official welcome sign to my town should read, \"Welcome to Dullsville--bigger than a cave, but small enough to feel claustrophobic!\"\\n\\n A population of 8,000 look-a-likes, a weather forecast that\u0027s perfectly miserable all year round--sunny--fenced in cookie-cutter houses, and sprawling farmland--that\u0027s Dullsville. The 8:10 freight train that runs through town separates the wrong side of the tracks from the right side, the cornfields from the golf course, the tractors from the golf carts. I think the town has it backward. How can land that grows corn and wheat be worth less than land filled with sand traps?\\n\\n The hundred-year-old courthouse sits on the town square. I haven\u0027t gotten into enough trouble to be dragged there--yet. Boutiques, a travel agent, a computer store, a florist, and a second-run movie theater all sit happily around the square.\\n\\n I wish our house could lie on the railroad tracks, on wheels, and carry us out of town, but we\u0027re on the right side near the country club. Dullsville. The only exciting place is an abandoned mansion an exiled baroness built on top of Benson Hill, where she died in isolation.\\n\\n I have only one friend in Dullsville--a farm girl, Becky Miller, who is more unpopular than I am. I was in third grade when I officially met her. Sitting on the school steps waiting for my mom to pick me up (late as usual) now that she was trying to be a Corporate Cathy, I noticed an impish girl cowering at the bottom of the steps, crying like a baby. She didn\u0027t have any friends, since she was shy and lived on the east side of the tracks. She was one of the few farm girls in our school and sat two rows behind me in class.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked, feeling sorry for her.\\n\\n \"My mom forgot me!\" she hollered, her hands covering her pathetic, wet face.\\n\\n \"No, she didn\u0027t,\" I consoled.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s never this late!\" she cried.\\n\\n \"Maybe she\u0027s stuck in traffic.\"\\n\\n \"You think so?\"\\n\\n \"Sure! Or maybe she got a call from one of those nosey sales people that always asks, \u0027Is your mother home?\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" \"Happens all the time. Or maybe she had to stop for snacks, and there was a long line at 7-Eleven.\"\\n\\n \"Would she do that?\"\\n\\n \"Why not, you have to eat, don\u0027t you? So never fear. She\u0027ll be here.\"\\n\\n And sure enough, a blue pickup drove up with one apologetic mother and a friendly, fluffy sheepdog.\\n\\n \"My mom says you can come over Saturday if it\u0027s okay with your parents,\" Becky said, running back to me.\\n\\n No one had ever invited me to their house before. I wasn\u0027t shy like Becky but I was just as unpopular. I was always late for school because I overslept, I wore sunglasses in class, and I had opinions, all atypical in Dullsville.\\n\\n Becky had a backyard as big as Transylvania--a great place to hide and play monsters and eat all the fresh apples a growling third- grade stomach could hold. I was the only kid in our class who didn\u0027t beat her up, exclude her, or call her names, and I even kicked anyone who tried. She was my three-dimensional shadow. I was her best friend and her bodyguard. And still am.\\n\\n When I wasn\u0027t playing with Becky, I spent my time applying black lipstick and nail polish, scuffing my already-worn combat boots, and burying my head behind Anne Rice novels. I was eleven when our family went to New Orleans for vacation. Mom and Dad wanted to play blackjack on the Flamingo riverboat casino. Nerd Boy wanted to go to the aquarium. But I knew where I was going: I wanted to visit the house of Anne Rice\u0027s birth, the historical homes she had restored, and the mansion she now called home.\\n\\n I stood mesmerized outside its iron gate, a Gothic mega- mansion, my mom (my uninvited chaperone) by my side. I could sense ravens flying overhead, even though there probably weren\u0027t any. It was a shame I hadn\u0027t come at night--it would have been that much more beautiful. Several girls who looked just like me stood across the street, taking pictures. I wanted to rush over and say, \"Be my friends. We can tour the cemeteries together!\" It was the first time in my life I felt like I belonged. I was in the city where they stack coffins on top of one another so you can see them, instead of burying them deep within the earth. There were college guys with two-toned spiky blond hair. Funky people were everywhere, except on Bourbon Street, where the tourists looked like they\u0027d flown in from Dullsville. Suddenly a limousine pulled around the corner. The blackest limo I had ever seen. The driver, complete with black chauffeur\u0027s hat, opened the door, and she stepped out!\\n\\n I freaked and watched motionless, like time was standing still. Right before my eyes was my idol of all living idols, Anne Rice!\\n\\n She glowed like a movie star, a Gothic angel, a heavenly creature. Her long black hair flowed over her shoulders and glistened; she wore a golden headband, a long, flowing silky skirt, and a fabulous vampirish, dark cloak. I was speechless. I thought I might go into shock.\\n\\n Fortunately my mom\u0027s never speechless.\\n\\n \"Could my daughter please have your autograph?\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" the queen of nocturnal adventures sweetly replied.\\n\\n I walked toward her, as if my marshmallow legs would melt under the sun at any moment. After she signed a yellow Post-it note my mom found in her purse, the Gothic starlet and I were standing beside each other, smiling, her arm around my waist.\\n\\n Anne Rice had agreed to take a picture with me!\\n\\n I had never smiled like that in my life. She probably smiled like she\u0027d smiled a million times before. A moment she\u0027ll never remember, a moment I\u0027ll never forget.\\n\\n Why didn\u0027t I tell her I loved her books? Why didn\u0027t I tell her how much she meant to me? That I thought she had a handle on things like no one else did?\\n\\n I screamed with excitement for the rest of the day, reenacting the scene over and over for my dad and Nerd Boy at our antique- filled, pastel pink bed-and-breakfast. It was our first day in New Orleans, and I was ready to go home. Who cared about a stupid aquarium, the French Quarter, blues bands, and Mardi Gras beads when I\u0027d just seen a vampire angel?\\n\\n I waited all day to get the film developed, only to find that the picture of me and Anne Rice didn\u0027t come out. Sullen, I retreated back to the hotel with my mother. Despite the fact she and I had appeared in photographs separately, could it be possible that the combination of the two vampire-lovers couldn\u0027t be captured on film? Or rather it was just a reminder that she was a brilliant bestselling writer, and I was a screamy, dreamy child going through a dark phase. Or maybe it was that my mom was a lousy photographer. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-kisses-vampire-kisses-1/page-2.html","bookId":2137,"book":{"id":2137,"title":"Vampire Kisses (Vampire Kisses #1)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Kisses (Vampire Kisses #1) \\n A new guy in town.Rumors of vampires.
