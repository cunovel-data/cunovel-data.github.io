{"id":95252,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\"You what?\" my father yelled during dinner after I told him I lost his racket.\n \"Well, it\u0027s not exactly lost. I just don\u0027t have it.\"\n \"Then get it back if you know where it is.\"\n \"That would be impossible right now.\"\n \"But I have a game tomorrow!\"\n \"I know, Dad, but you have other rackets.\" I tried to deflate the power of that one particular racket. Big mistake!\n \"Others? It\u0027s that easy for you? just go buy another Prince Precision OS racket?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t mean that--\"\n \"It\u0027s bad enough you deface property at school!\"\n \"I\u0027m sorry, but--\"\n \"Sorry\u0027s not good enough this time. Sorry\u0027s not going to win me my game tomorrow. My racket is. I can\u0027t believe I let you take it out of here in the first place!\" \"But, Dad, I\u0027m sure you made mistakes when you were a hippie teenager!\"\n \"And I paid for them! Like you\u0027re going to pay for my racket.\"\n My bank account had about five dollars in it, the remains of my Sweet Sixteenth birthday money. And I still owed Premiere Video twenty-five dollars in late fees. I quickly did the math in my head. Dad was going to have to keep my allowance until I was thirty.\n Then he said the three words that reverberated in my head and made me go dizzy with fury. As he said them I thought I was going to explode into a million unhappy pieces.\n \"Get a job!\" he proclaimed. \"It\u0027s about time, too. Maybe that\u0027ll teach you some responsibility!\"\n \"Can\u0027t you just spank me? Or ground me? Or not speak to me for years like parents do on those talk shows? Please, Dad!\"\n \"It\u0027s final! End of story! I\u0027ll help you find a job if you can\u0027t on your own. But you\u0027ll have to do the work yourself.\"\n I ran to my room, wailing like baby Nerd Boy, screaming at the top of my lungs, \"You people just don\u0027t understand the pressure of being a teenager in my generation!\"\n As I cried on my bed, I fantasized about sneaking into the Mansion like I did with Jack Patterson when I was twelve and retrieving the racket.\n But I also knew I was a little bigger in the hips now and that the window we\u0027d used had been replaced. I\u0027m sure the new owners also had a security system and, in any case, where would I look for the racket with so many rooms and closets? And while I was searching frantically, I was sure to be caught by Creepy Man wielding a gun or some medieval torture device. A part-time job was a less menacing scenario, but not by much. At this point I really wished I were a vampire--I\u0027d never heard of Dracula\u0027s having a job.\n Connections. They\u0027d be wonderful if my dad knew Steven Spielberg or the Queen of England, but Janice Armstrong of Armstrong Travel just doesn\u0027t cut it for me.\n Far worse than having to show up there after school three days a week, answering phones in a perky voice, photocopying tickets with that hideous blinding flash in my eyes, and talking to yuppies going to Europe for the fourth time was the totally conservative dress code.\n \"I\u0027m sorry, but you won\u0027t be able to wear those...\" Janice began, staring at my shoes. \"What do you kids call them?\"\n \"Combat boots.\"\n \"We aren\u0027t the army. And it\u0027s okay to wear lipstick, but it should be red.\"\n \"Red?\"\n \"But you can pick any shade.\"\n Very generous, Janice! \"How about pink?\"\n \"Pink would be great. And you\u0027ll need to wear skirts. But not too short.\"\n \"Red skirts?\" I asked.\n \"No, they don\u0027t have to be red. They can be green or blue.\"\n \"I can pick any shade?\" If she was going to make me feel like an idiot, I was going to act like one.\n \"Certainly. And hose--\" \"Not black?\"\n \"Not ripped.\"\n \"And the nail polish,\" she began, staring at my fingertips.\n \"Not black, but any shade of red. Or pink would be great,\" I recited.\n \"Very good,\" she said with a big smile. \"You\u0027re fitting in already!\"\n \"Thanks, I guess,\" I said as I got up to leave. I checked my watch. The interview had taken fifteen minutes, but it felt like an hour. This job was going to be complete torture.\n \"I\u0027ll see you tomorrow, at four o\u0027clock then, Raven. Any questions?\"\n \"Do I get paid for the interview?\"\n \"You\u0027re father said you were bright, but he didn\u0027t mention your wonderful sense of humor. We\u0027ll get along great. Who knows, you may want to be a travel agent when you get older.\"\n Mrs. Peevish, my infamous kindergarten teacher, would have been proud.\n \"I already know what I want to be,\" I replied. I wanted to say a vampire, just for old time\u0027s sake. But I knew she wouldn\u0027t get it.\n \"What do you want to be?\"\n \"A professional tennis player. They get free rackets!\"\n My mother bought me some horrible brightly colored Corporate Cathy gear so I could fit neatly into the package of Dullsville\u0027s business world. I pulled them out of the shopping bags and freaked when I saw the price tags.\n \"Yikes! These outfits cost more than the tennis racket. Just keep them and we\u0027ll be even.\"\n \"That\u0027s not the point!\"\n \"This doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\n I reluctantly modeled a white blouse and blue knee-length skirt. My mother looked at me like I was the daughter she always wanted.\n \"Don\u0027t you remember wearing halter tops, braids, and bell- bottoms?\" I asked. \"What I wear isn\u0027t that much different for my generation.\"\n \"I\u0027m not that little girl anymore, Raven. And besides, I never wore lipstick. I went au naturel.\"\n \"Ugh,\" I said, and rolled my eyes.\n \"Being a teenager is hard, I know. But you\u0027ll eventually find out who you really are.\"\n \"I know who I am! And working at a travel agency and wearing a white blouse and hose isn\u0027t going to make me find the \u0027inner me.\u0027\"\n \"Oh, sweetie.\" She tried to hug me. \"When you\u0027re a teenager, you think that no one understands you and the whole world is against you.\"\n \"No, it\u0027s just this town that\u0027s against me. I\u0027d go crazy, Mom, if I thought the whole world was against me!\"\n She hugged me hard and this time I let her. \"I love you, Raven,\" she said, like only a smooshy mom can. \"You\u0027re beautiful in black, but you\u0027re smashing in red!\"\n \"Quit it, Mom, you\u0027re wrinkling my new blouse.\" \"I thought you\u0027d never say that!\" she said and squeezed me even tighter.\n The part-time after-school gig had to go. How could I get the scoop on the Mansion family if I was going to be at work all afternoon? I had to drag all those dry-clean only clothes with me to school and keep them neatly in my locker until school was over. My new afternoon punishment tore me up inside.\n \"Why doesn\u0027t that guy go to school?\" I asked Becky as I was getting dressed.\n \"Maybe he isn\u0027t registered yet.\"\n \"If I didn\u0027t have this stupid job, we could go investigate right now. Ugh!\"\n I was envious of Becky because she got to go home to the land of cable TV and microwave popcorn, while I went from a school desk to a reception desk.\n After parting ways with Becky, I snuck into the restroom and wiped off my black lipstick with a wet paper towel and replaced it with some ultra-flashy shade of red. I truly looked like a ghost with my pale complexion. I reluctantly put on my bright red rayon-and- cotton blends. \"I\u0027ll miss you, but we\u0027ll be back together in a few hours,\" I said to my black dress and combat boots, placing them in my backpack.\n I gave myself a once over--this was one time I really thought being a vampire would come in handy. Maybe I\u0027d look in the mirror and see nothing. Instead I saw a miserable girl standing awkwardly in her red rayon outfit. I slithered out of the restroom looking right and left like I was crossing the street and made my escape safely out the front door. Or so I thought.\n Trevor was standing on the front steps.\n I freaked when I saw him but tried to ignore his presence and move on. I wanted to run, but I wasn\u0027t used to skinny heels.\n \"Hey, Halloween\u0027s over!\" he shouted, following me. \"Where\u0027s your tennis skirt? Going to some costume party as Suzie Secretary?\"\n I continued to ignore him, but he grabbed my arm.\n I couldn\u0027t let him know that I was working, or where I was working, and, most of all, that I was working because I had to pay my father back for the tennis racket Trevor had made me lose. It would have brought him too much joy.\n He looked me over, that same look he had given me when he first saw me in my tennis outfit. This time I was his corporate dream girl.\n \"So, where are you going?\"\n \"None of your business!\"\n \"Really? I didn\u0027t think we kept secrets from each other.\"\n \"Get lost already.\"\n \"I\u0027ll just walk with you then.\"\n I stopped. \"You will not walk with me! You will not go anywhere with me! You will leave me alone! For good. Forever!\"\n \"You don\u0027t seem your usual loving self,\" he said, laughing. \"Having a bad hair day? You should be used to that by now.\" \"Trevor, it\u0027s over. Your games and mine! You don\u0027t have to harass me anymore. We\u0027re even. We\u0027re even for all of eternity. Okay? So just get out of my face!\"\n He ran after me when I stormed off.\n \"Are we breaking up? I didn\u0027t know we were going together, baby. Please don\u0027t leave me,\" he begged, jokingly.\n I walked quickly past the school fence and scurried down the sidewalk. I had five minutes to get to Armstrong Travel.\n \"I can\u0027t live without you!\" he said sarcastically, catching up. \"Are you mad because I never gave you black roses? I\u0027ll make it up to you. I\u0027ll get you new clothes--from the graveyard.\" He howled with laughter. \"Just don\u0027t leave me, babe!\"\n \"Cut it out!\" I was fuming. He probably had two hundred dollars in his back pocket and I\u0027d have to work for eons in a place I hated because of his stupid antics.\n \"Just tell me where you\u0027re going!\"\n \"Trevor, quit it! Get out of here! I\u0027ll get a restraining order if I have to!\"\n \"Do you have a date?\" He wasn\u0027t going to give up.\n \"Go away!\"\n \"You\u0027re meeting someone?\"\n \"Buzz off!\"\n \"Do you have an interview? An interview...with the vampire?\"\n \"Get out of my face!\"\n \"Are you going to...work?\"\n I stopped. \"No! Are you totally crazy? That\u0027s so lame!\" \"You are! You\u0027ve got a job!\" He danced around. \"I\u0027m so proud of you, my little gothic baby has found herself a job!\"\n I was fuming inside.\n \"Trying to better your life? Or are you paying Daddy back for that fancy little tennis racket?\"\n I was ready to hit him and this time send his head flying off into the distance instead of a can of spray paint.\n Just then Matt pulled up. \"Trevor, dude. You said you\u0027d be on the steps. I don\u0027t have time to drive all over town trying to find you. We have to go\"\n \"Good, your baby-sitter found you,\" I said.\n \"I\u0027d offer you a ride to work, but we have places to be,\" Trevor teased.\n As the Camaro whizzed off I looked at my watch. Great! My first day of work and I was late. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-kisses-vampire-kisses-1/page-9.html","bookId":2137,"book":{"id":2137,"title":"Vampire Kisses (Vampire Kisses #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Kisses (Vampire Kisses #1) \n A new guy in town.Rumors of vampires.
