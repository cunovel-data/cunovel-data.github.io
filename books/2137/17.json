{"id":95260,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"My first date! Becky said my first date was dinner at the Mansion, but I didn\u0027t agree. Tonight we would be going out: to watch a movie, to play miniature golf, to share a soda at Shirley\u0027s. I spent all afternoon talking with Becky, speculating about where he\u0027d take me, what he\u0027d be wearing, and when he would kiss me.\n I was so excited, I ran the whole way there. I had to meet Alexander at his iron gate. My mom would have freaked if she had known I had a date with the guy who lived in a haunted house. I couldn\u0027t bear the thought of his showing up at my door and my dad\u0027s asking him questions about tennis players and his plans for college. So I had to meet my Romeo on his balcony.\n And there he was, leaning against the iron gate, sexy in his black jeans and black leather jacket, holding a backpack.\n \"Are we going on a hike?\" I asked.\n \"No, a picnic.\"\n \"At this hour?\"\n \"Is there a better time?\"\n I shook my head, with a smile. I had no idea where Alexander would take me, but I could imagine the response from our fellow Dullsvillians.\n \"Doesn\u0027t this bother you?\" I asked, pointing to the graffiti.\n Alexander shrugged. \"Jameson wanted to paint over it, but I wouldn\u0027t let him. One man\u0027s graffiti is another man\u0027s masterpiece.\" He took my hand and led me down the street without any hints of our plans for the night. And I didn\u0027t care where we were going, just as long as it was a million miles away and he never let go.\n We stopped at Dullsville\u0027s cemetery.\n \"Here we are,\" he said.\n I had never been taken out on a date, much less a date to a cemetery. Dullsville\u0027s cemetery dated from the early 1800s. I\u0027m sure Dullsville was much more exciting as a pioneer town--tiny dress shops, saloons, traders, gamblers, and those Victorian lace-up boots that were totally in.\n \"Do you bring all your dates here?\" I asked.\n \"Are you afraid?\" he asked.\n \"I used to play here as a child. But during the day.\"\n \"This cemetery is probably the most lively place in town.\"\n The rumors were true. Alexander did come to the cemetery in the dark.\n The creepy gate was locked to ensure uneasy access for Dullsville\u0027s vandals.\n \"We\u0027ll have to climb,\" he said. \"But I know how you like climbing gates.\"\n \"We can get in trouble for this,\" I pointed out. \"But it\u0027s okay to sneak into houses, right?\" he asked. \"Don\u0027t worry. I know one of the people.\"\n Dead? Alive? A corpse? Maybe a cousin of Jameson\u0027s worked the graveyard shift--literally.\n Alexander turned away as I struggled to get over in my tight spandex dress.\n After we both dusted off, he took my hand and led me down the middle path, where gravestones were lined up for miles. Some of the grave markers signified a plague that devastated in the 1800s. Alexander walked briskly like he knew exactly where he was going.\n Where was he leading me? Who did he know here? Did he sleep here? Had he brought me here to kiss me? And would I become a vampire?\n I slowed down. Did I really want to be a vampire? And call this my home? For all eternity?\n I tripped over the handle of a shovel, which sent me tumbling forward. I started to fall into an empty grave. Alexander grabbed my arm in the nick of time.\n I hung over the empty grave, staring down into the darkness.\n \"Don\u0027t be afraid. It doesn\u0027t have your name on it,\" Alexander joked.\n \"I think I\u0027m supposed to be home,\" I said nervously, brushing graveyard dirt off my dress.\n But he led me further into the cemetery with his strong hand.\n Suddenly we were standing atop a small hill beneath a giant marble monument.\n He picked up some fresh daffodils that had blown away and replaced them tenderly at the foot of Baroness Sterling\u0027s monument. \"I\u0027d like you to meet someone,\" he said, looking at me gently and then at the grave. \"Grandma, this is Raven.\"\n I didn\u0027t know what to say as I stared at the marker. I had never met a dead person before. What was I supposed to say--\"She looks just like you\"?\n But of course, he didn\u0027t expect me to say anything as he sat down on the grass and drew me next to him.\n \"Grandma used to live here--I mean in town. She left us the house and we finally got it after years of probate. I always loved the Mansion.\"\n \"Wow. The baroness was your grandmother?\"\n \"I visit her when I feel lonely. She understood what it felt like to be alone. She didn\u0027t fit in with the Sterling side of the family. Grandpa died in the war. She said I always reminded her of him.\" He took a deep breath and looked up at the stars. \"It\u0027s beautiful here, don\u0027t you think?\" he went on. \"There aren\u0027t many lights to block out the stars. It\u0027s like the universe is a huge canvas, with sprinkles of light that twinkle and glisten, like a painting that is always there, just waiting to be looked at. But people don\u0027t notice it because they\u0027re too busy. And it\u0027s the most beautiful work of all. Well, almost--\"\n We were silent for a few minutes, gazing at the heavens. I heard only his soft breath and the sound of crickets. All first dates should be as wonderful as this. It totally beat a first-run movie.\n \"So your grandma\u0027s the lady that stared out the wind--uh, I mean she, well...\"\n \"She was a wonderful artist. She taught me how to paint superheroes and monsters. Lots of monsters!\"\n \"I know.\"\n \"You know?\" \"I mean, I know it must be hard for you. But I like vampires, too!\" I hinted.\n He seemed to be thinking of something else. \"I traveled so much, and since I was homeschooled, I never had the chance to fit in anywhere.\"\n He looked so lost, so soulful, so lonely. I wanted him to kiss me now. I wanted to let him know I was his for all eternity.\n \"Let\u0027s eat,\" he suddenly said, climbing to his feet.\n He placed five black candles in ornate votive holders and lit them with an antique lighter. He unpacked a bottle of sparkling juice and crackers and cheese and spread a black lace tablecloth over the cold grass.\n \"Have you ever been in love?\" I asked as he filled my crystal goblet.\n Suddenly we heard a howl and the candles blew out.\n \"What was that?\" I asked.\n \"I think it\u0027s a dog.\"\n \"It sounds more like a wolf!\"\n \"Either way, we\u0027d better go!\" he said urgently.\n I started to shove everything into his backpack.\n \"We don\u0027t have time for that!\" he said, grabbing my hand.\n The wind continued to howl. The noise was getting closer.\n We hid behind the monument.\n \"If it\u0027s a ghost you\u0027ve come to see,\" a familiar voice called to us, \"I can assure you that the only ghost you\u0027ll be seeing tonight is your own.\" A man followed with a flashlight. It was Old Jim, the caretaker, with Luke, his Great Dane.\n If he recognized me here at this hour I\u0027d have to bribe him with a year\u0027s supply of dog biscuits to keep him from telling my parents.\n We peeked out and could see the dog licking juice off the grass.\n \"Give me that, Luke,\" Old Jim said and picked up the bottle. He took a long swig.\n \"Now!\" Alexander whispered. He tightened his grip on my hand and we ran, scampering over the fence.\n I don\u0027t think a real ghost and a phantom wolf could have scared me more than Old Jim and his rusty Luke.\n \"I guess I should have taken you to a movie after all,\" Alexander said with a smile after we caught our breath. \"I\u0027ll walk you home.\"\n \"Can we go to your house?\" I pleaded. \"I want to see your room!\"\n \"You can\u0027t see my room.\"\n \"We have time.\"\n \"No way.\"\n There was an edginess in his voice I hadn\u0027t heard before.\n \"What\u0027s in your room, Alexander?\"\n \"What\u0027s in your room, Raven?\" he asked, glaring at me. \"Let\u0027s go back to your place.\"\n \"Uh...well...\" He was right. I couldn\u0027t bring him into my house and subject him to Billy Boy and my white-bread parents. Not on our first date. \"My room\u0027s a mess.\"\n \"Well, mine is, too,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t have to go home, really.\"\n \"I don\u0027t want to get you in trouble.\"\n \"I always get in trouble. My mom wouldn\u0027t recognize me if I wasn\u0027t in trouble.\"\n But the streets we walked, hand-in-hand, led back to my house, and no matter how slowly I walked, before I knew it we were standing on my doorstep, saying good-bye.\n \"Well...until...next time...\" he said, his face shining beneath the porch light.\n \"Next time the mortuary?\"\n \"I thought we could watch a movie at my house.\"\n \"You have a TV?\" I said. \"It\u0027s powered by electricity, you know.\"\n \"Sassy girl, I have Bela Lugosi\u0027s Dracula on DVD, since you like vampires so much.\"\n \"Dracula? Awesome!\"\n \"Then it\u0027s a date. Seven o\u0027clock tomorrow, okay?\"\n \"Sensational!\"\n We had made another date and there was nothing to do now but say good-bye. Primo moment for a luscious kiss. He put his hand on my shoulder and leaned in, his eyes closed and his lips full.\n Suddenly the door locks rattled. Alexander stepped out of the light and into the bushes.\n \"I thought I heard voices,\" my mom said, opening the door. \"Where\u0027s Becky?\"\n \"She\u0027s at home.\" It was actually the truth. \"I don\u0027t like you running off without telling me,\" she scolded, holding the door open for me.\n Longing to have that moment back and one moment more, I looked over at Alexander.\n \"Did you guys go to the movies?\" she asked as I reluctantly stepped inside.\n \"No, Mom, we went to the cemetery.\"\n \"For once, I wish you would give me a straight answer!\"\n For once, I was giving her a straight answer.\n And as I looked over my shoulder for a final glimpse of my Gothic Dream Mate, she closed the door on my heavenly first date. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-kisses-vampire-kisses-1/page-17.html","bookId":2137,"book":{"id":2137,"title":"Vampire Kisses (Vampire Kisses #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Kisses (Vampire Kisses #1) \n A new guy in town.Rumors of vampires.
