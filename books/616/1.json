{"id":40810,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I","content":"Young Lyon, lounging in the Court House to make up his daily tale of items for the Waynscott News, was perhaps the only man who knew exactly how the quarrel between Lawrence and Fullerton began, though, when later events had made that quarrel take on an unexpected significance, he was exactly the one man who did not talk about it. \n \n Through the glass side-panel of the door he had seen Lawrence coming up the stone walk from the street, and he had watched him with eagerness, meaning to get a nod as he passed, for Lawrence was not only a rising young lawyer, but, what was more important to the cub reporter, he had just won the championship in the curling contest of the city clubs. Slight as was Lyon\u0027s acquaintance with him, it had the touch of hero-worship which a youth is always ready to pour out as an offering before a man who is at once an athlete, a social success, a man eminent in professional life, and withal magnetic and charming in his personal relations, as Lawrence was. So he counted it luck just to have the chance to say \"Good morning.\" It seems that Fullerton must have approached from the side street, for the two men met at the foot of the Court House steps and came up together. Lyon noticed that though they nodded to each other they did not speak. At the top Fullerton pushed ahead so as to come first through the revolving pepperbox of a storm-door which made the entrance of fresh air to the Court House as difficult as was the exit of foul air within. Lawrence swung through in the next compartment, pushing the door around much more rapidly than suited Fullerton\u0027s dignified gait. The knowledge that he had thumped his distinguished predecessor\u0027s heels probably cheered Lawrence\u0027s heart, for he cried gayly as he emerged, \n \n \"You see I follow in your footsteps.\" \n \n \"Not for the first time,\" said Fullerton in level tones, with a slow lifting of his lowered eyelids. \n \n The effect of those quiet words on Lawrence\u0027s temper was surprising. Instantly his hand flashed out and he slapped Fullerton\u0027s face. \n \n In a moment half a dozen men were between them. Some one restored Fullerton\u0027s hat, which had fallen off at his sudden start, while others officiously laid restraining hands on Lawrence, who was trembling like a nervous horse. \n \n \"You may think a trick will win, but, by my soul, I\u0027ll take the trick,\" he cried hotly. \n \n Fullerton, who was quite white except where the marks of Lawrence\u0027s fingers burned like a new brand on his cheek, stood perfectly still for an instant, with his eyes on the floor, as though waiting for anything further that his opposing counsel might have to say. Then he replaced his hat, bowed slightly to the group, and walked away to the elevator. \n \n \"Jove, if I had the grip on my temper that Fullerton has, I\u0027d be Attorney General by now,\" said Lawrence lightly. \"Guess I\u0027ll take the other elevator, all the same.\" And he walked jauntily down the hall. \n \n The collected group of men burst into excited cross-currents of talk. \n \n \"What was it all about?\" \n \n \"What will Fullerton do?\" \n \n \"Gee, but Lawrence might be disbarred for that.\" \n \n \"Fullerton, of all men! He must be getting old, if he lets that pass.\" \n \n \"Oh, this isn\u0027t the end of it, you can bet on that all right.\" \n \n \"But what was it all about?\" \n \n \"Why, Fullerton got a decision in the Symes case yesterday,--beat Lawrence on a technicality. It was rather sharp practice, but Fullerton goes into a case to win, and he knows all the tricks of the trade. You heard what Lawrence said about taking the trick?\" \n \n Yes, they had all heard what Lawrence had said. Lyon listened to the gossip, but contributed nothing. He was perfectly certain that Lawrence\u0027s hot speech about a trick had been expressly intended for the by-standers. The champion was too good a sport to take a professional defeat like a baby. And the quick speeches that had preceded the blow no one had heard but himself. He walked down the steps thoughtfully. It was his business to understand things. \n \n But the quarrel did not appear among the news items he turned into the city editor. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2034/57893.html","bookId":616,"book":{"id":616,"title":"The Hemlock Avenue Mystery","description":"简介： Young Lyon, lounging in the Court House to make up his daily tale of items for the Waynscott News, was perhaps the only man who knew exactly how the quarrel between Lawrence and Fullerton began, though, when later events had made that quarrel take on...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2034","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:02 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:02 AM"}}
