Then she hovered above me and tucked her thighs warm and tight around my waist. I listened to her fumble and find a condom on my nightstand.\n The sound of her ripping it open made my stomach muscles tense in anticipation. Then she gripped me with her free hand and felt her way into slipping on the latex. Once she had me sheathed and she’d positioned herself in place above me, I lifted as soon as her warm wetness settled against the head of my cock. But Midnight Visitor caught my hip, keeping me from plunging into her.\n I arched an eyebrow in the dark. “I guess you want to be totally in charge this round, huh?”\n She answered me by grasping both my wrists and pinning them to the bed on either side of my head. With a roll of her hips, she guided me inside her. I could’ve broken free; she wasn’t holding me all that tight. But she seemed to like what she was doing, and I sure as hell didn’t mind it.\n She began to ride me, and I groaned, arching my back. “Fuck...me.” This was awesome.\n Above me, she let out a husky chuckle. Fingernails lightly scraped up my chest to play with my nipples. “What’re the odds that I can make you cry out that other woman’s name when you come?”\n “Wha...?” She about made me go cross-eyed by how tight and fast she moved. I couldn’t think about anything else at the moment.\n “Are you imagining I’m her right now?”\n The woman was killing me. I was getting carried away with how good she felt, and here she had to go and remind me of Caroline? “Shh,” I hissed, reaching up to grip her breasts. “Don’t be weird.”\n “It’s okay,” she murmured, as if coaxing a frightened animal. “You can say it. Say her name.”\n I gritted my teeth. “I’m not going to fucking say her name.”\n “But I don’t mind if you—”\n “That’s fucked up. You have to mind. Why wouldn’t you mind?” Hell, I wanted her to mind. If she didn’t care, then this couldn’t mean as much to her as it did to me. And I couldn’t accept the idea that she wasn’t as into me as I was into her.\n She slid her hand down my chest, over my belly and below my navel to where, oh Holy God, I think she touched herself. “Because what if...what if it’s my name you say?”\n “It’s not...it can’t be.” I shook my head, denying it, even as I reached for her hand, because I had to know what she was—fuck me, she was rubbing her clit.\n “But what if it is?” she pressed, drawing me back to that damn annoying conversation. Her voice grew breathier. She had to be getting closer to her release, an idea which made me closer to mine.\n “You better not fucking be her,” I gritted out, arching up into her.\n “Why not?”\n “Because I can’t...shit, fuck, that feels good. I can’t feel this with her. I can’t do this with her.”\n “And yet that’s exactly what you might be doing.”\n Just the idea that she could be Caroline had me so close, I bucked my hips again, harder this time, driving into her as deep as I could go. She cried out and dug her fingers into my shoulders. “Oren.”\n “Damn,” I panted. “I want to see you so bad right now.”\n She leaned down so I could feel her legs shift with each plunge that she wrought down on me. Something that had been hanging around her neck thumped against my chest right before she whispered into my ear. “Sorry, but you’ll just have to use your imagination. Because you’ll never see me during these visits.”\n “Oh, yeah?” I was tempted to just put her in her place. “I could reach over and flip on my nightlight...right now.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-44.html","bookId":2714,"book":{"id":2714,"title":"A Perfect Ten (Forbidden Men #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Let your hair down, Caroline, they said. It\u0027ll be fun, they said. \n I know I\u0027ve closed myself off in a major way over the past year, ever since “the incident” where I messed up my life completely. It\u0027s past time I try to live again or just give up altogether. But this is quite possibly the craziest thing I\u0027ve ever done. In a last ditch effort to invigorate myself, I\u0027m standing outside Oren Tenning\u0027s bedroom, I just peeled off the sexiest pair of underwear I own, and my hand is already raised to knock. My brother would disown me for doing anything with his best friend, and he\u0027d probably kill Oren. But if I play my cards right, no one will ever know about this. Not even Ten. \n Maybe after tonight, I’ll finally get over this stupid, irrational crush I hate having on the biggest jerk I’ve ever met. Or maybe I’ll just end up falling for him even harder. Maybe I’ll discover there’s so much more to my crude, carefree hunk than meets the eye. \n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:49 AM"}}
