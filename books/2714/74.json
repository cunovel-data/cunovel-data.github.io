{"id":75030,"no":74,"title":"Page 74","content":"Wanting to show him just how much he meant to me, I paid his birthmark a little extra attention and licked my way up the side of it before taking the head of his cock into my mouth.\\n\\n He grasped my hair tight, just the way I liked, and I groaned as I sucked him to the back of my throat.\\n\\n “Okay, you’re right,” he rasped. “I like waking up this way better.”\\n\\n I chuckled around a mouthful and proceeded to give him the best head of my life, except he tugged me off him just before he came. Then he rolled me onto my back and gazed in awe at me before picking up one of my legs. Starting at my ankle, he kissed and licked and nibbled his way down until his mouth was on my pussy and his tongue was inside me.\\n\\n “Oh my God, Oren.” I panted and squeezed handfuls of the sheets under me. “You feel so good. That feels so good.”\\n\\n He glanced up to ask, “You gonna come?”\\n\\n “Yes!” I snapped, wishing he’d return his mouth to me, but instead he reared up into a sitting position.\\n\\n Gazing down at me where I was still lying on my back with my legs, splayed open, he smiled slowly. “You are so fucking gorgeous.”\\n\\n He grasped one of my legs and then the other. “The first moment I saw you, in nothing but a T-shirt, I looked at these beautiful toned thighs right here,” he lifted them as he spoke, “and I wanted to know what they’d feel like wrapped around me.”\\n\\n I helped him curl my legs around him. He pushed up onto his knees and then hovered himself above me, aligning us until I felt his heat and hardness against me, ready to enter.\\n\\n “I saw this mouth,” he went on, “chapped and pale. And I wanted to taste it.” Leaning down, he pressed his lips gently to mine. We breathed each other in until he murmured, “then I looked into your eyes, and...Jesus.”\\n\\n He pressed his forehead to mine and gazed into my eyes. “What the fuck have you done to me, Caroline?”\\n\\n He thrust into me, and I gasped out my shock from the initial stretch, so full, so big. Always so big.\\n\\n “Why couldn’t I stay away from you?” he demanded with another long, slow thrust. “Why can’t I get enough of you?” Thrust. “Why do I want to own every fucking piece of you?” Thrust.\\n\\n “B-because turnabout’s fair play, I guess.” I grasped his hair to help me absorb the delicious impact of each plunge, but that only seemed to make him pump harder and faster.\\n\\n With a disbelievingly little laugh, he shook his head. “What’re you saying? That I deserve this because you want me as much as I want you? Impossible. No one could want someone else this much. No one could fucking crave another this much.”\\n\\n Leaning up, I whispered into his ear. “I do.”\\n\\n With a tortured groan, he went crazy, fucking me to the mattress with a fervor I loved. I tightened my legs around him, tightened my grip in his hair and kissed him hard.\\n\\n We attacked each other so savagely that when I came, I bit his tongue. And I think he liked that too.\\n\\n “Damn.” He panted against my throat as sweat dripped off his temple and onto my shoulder. “That was...that was...”\\n\\n “Fucking awesome,” I breathed.\\n\\n He lifted his face and grinned down at me. “Yeah.” Then he blinked, and his brow furrowed. “Do I have to take you home today?”\\n\\n I shook my head, gladly willing to let him keep me forever. But then I frowned and nodded, realizing reality still awaited us, no matter how long we stayed holed up in his room.\\n\\n He groaned. “That’s what I was afraid of.” Then he rolled off me and sat up. I wasn’t ready for the absence of his warmth yet, but I hugged myself and sat up too.\\n\\n We dressed quietly. Oren glanced at me with a wrinkle of concern between his eyes as I slid on my shoes and he grabbed his wallet off his dresser. “You okay?”\\n\\n I knew he was asking about last night and what I’d learned at the doctor’s office, but I rolled my eyes. “After what just happened, I’m fabulous.”\\n\\n He chuckled, but not for long. “I’m serious, baby.” Slipping his arms around my waist when I straightened, he pressed his forehead to mine. “I know what the doctor told you wasn’t what you wanted to hear, but...” He sighed. I don’t think he knew what to say next, so he just shrugged. “Fuck, you got me, and I’m probably more to handle than any kid you could have.”\\n\\n His attempt to cheer me up made me smile. I was so tempted to tell him I loved him, that I’d loved him for months, before I’d ever snuck into his bedroom posing as someone else. But I settled for setting my mouth against his and murmuring, “I’ll take it. Thank you.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-74.html","bookId":2714,"book":{"id":2714,"title":"A Perfect Ten (Forbidden Men #5)","description":"Storyline: Let your hair down, Caroline, they said. It\u0027ll be fun, they said. \\n I know I\u0027ve closed myself off in a major way over the past year, ever since “the incident” where I messed up my life completely. It\u0027s past time I try to live again or just give up altogether. But this is quite possibly the craziest thing I\u0027ve ever done. In a last ditch effort to invigorate myself, I\u0027m standing outside Oren Tenning\u0027s bedroom, I just peeled off the sexiest pair of underwear I own, and my hand is already raised to knock. My brother would disown me for doing anything with his best friend, and he\u0027d probably kill Oren. But if I play my cards right, no one will ever know about this. Not even Ten. \\n Maybe after tonight, I’ll finally get over this stupid, irrational crush I hate having on the biggest jerk I’ve ever met. Or maybe I’ll just end up falling for him even harder. Maybe I’ll discover there’s so much more to my crude, carefree hunk than meets the eye. \\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:49 AM"}}
