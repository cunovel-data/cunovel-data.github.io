{"id":75010,"no":54,"title":"Page 54","content":"But really, how could I have done this to him? I’d put him in the worst situation ever. He loved and respected Noel; he’d never want to betray my brother this way. But I’d ignored all that for my own selfish needs. I couldn’t believe what a bitch I was. Biting my lip, I fought off tears and tried to think up a good enough apology when I noticed the banana sticker he’d put on my hand earlier. I blinked, staring hard. He’d known who I was when he’d put that there, hadn’t he? He’d known who I was when he’d called Midnight Visitor and arranged tonight’s rendezvous. He’d known who I was when I’d walked into his room tonight, and he’d grabbed me around the waist from behind and carried me to his bed where he’d tossed me onto the mattress. He’d known the entire time he’d ripped off my clothes and put his mouth and hands on me. That bastard had known, and he was sitting there casting judgment on me? I clenched my teeth. “If you’re so mad at me for tricking you, then why did you wait until you were inside me to tell me you knew?” The question threw him off his game. His hands fell away from his head as he blinked up at me. “Because I’m a guy?” He phrased it more as a question than an answer. I snorted. “Bullshit. Bull freaking shit. You’ve wanted me just as much as I’ve wanted you, and for just as long as I’ve wanted you, too, I bet.” Growling as he sat upright, he scowled back at me. “Well, obviously I have more impulse control than you do, because I was planning on never acting on those urges. Gamble is one of the best friends I ever had. And the only thing he ever asked me not to do was you. I fully planned on respecting his wishes, damn it. I do not want to betray my best friend.” I lost my grip on the sheet I was holding up to cover my chest when I set my hands on my hips. “Oh, don’t even pretend to act all holier than thou to me. I will take culpability for the first two nights, but not tonight. And no, you obviously don’t have any more impulse control than I do, because you still slept with me again after finding out who I was.” When I realized his attention had dropped to my bare chest, I lifted the sheet again. He grabbed them as well, and used the cloth between us to yank me close until we were only inches apart. His eyes flared with anger and heat and his teeth gritted in outrage, right before he said, “Only because two nights with you is not fucking enough.” Then his mouth attacked mine. I opened for him and kissed him back, hard and hot. He kneaded my breasts, his grip slightly rough, reminding me of the times he’d pulled my hair. I liked it when he wasn’t so gentle. When he was consumed with a mindless, ravenous passion. I started to wind my legs around his waist when he jumped back, cursing and wiping the back of his hand across his mouth. “Damn it,” he muttered. His face was flushed and eyes were wild and glassy. “Damn it, we can’t do this again.” The metaphorical slap of cold water did not feel good. “Oh my God, will you stop going from hot to cold and just make up your damn mind already? Do you want me or not?” His eyes flared as he looked into my face. “You know I want you. That’s the problem. I want you but I can’t have you.” I set my hands on my hips. “Well, you already have had me. Repeatedly. And you’ve had me when you knew good and well who I was. We’ve already established how thoroughly you can have me. The question is...are you going to keep me?” His Adam’s apple bobbed nervously as he swallowed. His eyes grew haunted and tempted as he gazed over my body. Then he squeezed his eyes closed and gritted out, “No.” My eyes filled with tears. I gulped in air, trying to dry them before he opened his lashes, when they flashed up as if he could hear my agony. Immediate regret clouded his face. “Caroline.” He started to reach for me, but I held up a hand. “No. Just stop right now. I’m done. I’m out. You and your stupid spotted dick can just go to hell.” He froze. “My spotted...what? Shit.” He glanced wildly around the room before hissing, “I’m going to kill her.” When his face drained of color, I frowned. “Huh?” He didn’t even hear my question as he ranted on to himself. “I cannot believe Blondie told you about that.” His gaze seared into mine, suddenly intense and desperate. “And it’s not spotted like there’s a bunch of dots. It’s one fucking birthmark. That’s it.” I shook my head. “What the hell are you talking about?”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-54.html","bookId":2714,"book":{"id":2714,"title":"A Perfect Ten (Forbidden Men #5)","description":"Storyline: Let your hair down, Caroline, they said. It\u0027ll be fun, they said. I know I\u0027ve closed myself off in a major way over the past year, ever since “the incident” where I messed up my life completely. It\u0027s past time I try to live again or just give up altogether. But this is quite possibly the craziest thing I\u0027ve ever done. In a last ditch effort to invigorate myself, I\u0027m standing outside Oren Tenning\u0027s bedroom, I just peeled off the sexiest pair of underwear I own, and my hand is already raised to knock. My brother would disown me for doing anything with his best friend, and he\u0027d probably kill Oren. But if I play my cards right, no one will ever know about this. Not even Ten. Maybe after tonight, I’ll finally get over this stupid, irrational crush I hate having on the biggest jerk I’ve ever met. Or maybe I’ll just end up falling for him even harder. Maybe I’ll discover there’s so much more to my crude, carefree hunk than meets the eye.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:49 AM"}}
