He watched Hart and his band pack away their equipment before shaking his head. “I swear that one guy in Asher’s band, the one with the Mohawk, drops even more f-bombs than you do, Ten.” I snorted, tipping my head to the side as I considered the bottle of tequila from a different angle. “Not even fucking possible,” I said before I shrugged and flipped over a shot glass to pour myself a drink. Then I downed the shot with a single swallow. “I think he’s more crude than you are, too.” “Good for him.” I poured myself another. Lowe finally looked at me, frowning. “You doing okay tonight?” Shot three, down the hatch. “Just fucking dandy. How’re you?” He lifted his eyebrows. “Uh…Asher,” he called. Hart looked our way and then jogged over. “What’s up?” Lowe hooked his thumb in my direction. “What is wrong with him?” Hart studied me for a second, and then returned his attention to Lowe. “Women trouble. What else?” Then he grinned and patted the bar. “Why don’t you take care of this one?” Lowe snorted. “As if I know what to do with a depressed Ten. That’s outside my scope of reality.” With a chuckle, Hart seated himself on a stool. I started in on my fifth shot…or was it my sixth? Shit, I’d already lost count how many I’d downed while these two were talking about me right fucking in front of my face. “So last time I saw you, you were asking Noel if you could date his sister,” Hart murmured, thoughtfully. “I wasn’t asking for permission,” I bit out. “Whatever.” He didn’t seem to care. “Noel said no, you argued back, and then he threatened to tell Caroline about all your past…women, if you tried anything with her, so…I’m guessing he told her anyway.” “No.” I swallowed more and hissed through my teeth as that one burned on the way down. “I told her.” “You did what?” both guys shouted in unison. “Oh, you stupid idiot.” Lowe sat his hand on my shoulder in commiseration. “Please don’t tell me you told her about all the women you’d ever been with.” “No.” I gave a harsh laugh. “She walked out before I could get through the entire list.” Lowe winced. Hart snickered. I shot them both a glare. “It was either I tell her or Gamble tell her. I thought it’d be better coming from me.” “How long ago did this happen?” Hart asked. “Last Saturday,” I uttered, feeling the pain of missing every little part of her: her voice, one of her cute little sexy texts, her arms around me, her smile. “Shit.” Lowe shook his head. “Give her at least a week.” I looked up at him. “What happens if she hasn’t talked to me within a week?” He shrugged. “Then give her two weeks.” “Then what happens if—” “Just give her some time, man.” I buried my face in my hands, abso-fucking-lutely miserable. Time was going to tear me apart if I had to spend too much of it away from her. “I’m such an idiot,” I ranted. “The last words my sister ever said to me before she died were not to turn into a man-whore, and what’s the first thing I did? I turned into a fucking man-whore to fight back the bad memories, and now it’s coming back to bite me in the ass.” Cupping the sides of my face in my hands, I looked up at Hart and Lowe, who gaped back at me as if I’d grown horns. Somewhere in my head, I realized I’d just spilled a bunch of shit about my sister, but at the moment, I couldn’t even care. There was more important shit going on. “What if I lose her?” Unable to take the weight of this pain, I sank to the floor and rested my elbows on my knees as I concentrated on not falling apart. “That’s it.” Hart tugged on my arm, trying to get me to stand. “I’m driving you home.” I shook my head. “No. Can’t go home,” I mumbled. “My sheets still fucking smell like her.” I hadn’t been able to sleep at all most of the week because of that. I probably should’ve washed them, but then they wouldn’t smell like her anymore, and that would’ve broken me even more. “Then you can crash on my couch. Let’s just get you out of here.” The next time he tried to pull me up, I let him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-144.html","bookId":2714,"book":{"id":2714,"title":"A Perfect Ten (Forbidden Men #5)","description":"Storyline: Let your hair down, Caroline, they said. It\u0027ll be fun, they said. I know I\u0027ve closed myself off in a major way over the past year, ever since “the incident” where I messed up my life completely. It\u0027s past time I try to live again or just give up altogether. But this is quite possibly the craziest thing I\u0027ve ever done. In a last ditch effort to invigorate myself, I\u0027m standing outside Oren Tenning\u0027s bedroom, I just peeled off the sexiest pair of underwear I own, and my hand is already raised to knock. My brother would disown me for doing anything with his best friend, and he\u0027d probably kill Oren. But if I play my cards right, no one will ever know about this. Not even Ten. Maybe after tonight, I’ll finally get over this stupid, irrational crush I hate having on the biggest jerk I’ve ever met. Or maybe I’ll just end up falling for him even harder. Maybe I’ll discover there’s so much more to my crude, carefree hunk than meets the eye.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:49 AM"}}
