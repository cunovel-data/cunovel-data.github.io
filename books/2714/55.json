She didn’t tell you, did she?”\n “Tell me what?” I let out a strange laugh. “You don’t really have a spotted dick, do you? I mean, I thought up that scenario because you’ll only do it in the dark and that’s really the only part of your body you haven’t shown off in public to, like, everyone. It was just a...theory.” My eyes began to grow wide as I realized how strangely he was watching me. “But, wow...” I blew out a long breath. “It’s true, isn’t it? You honestly have a spotted—”\n “Birthmark,” he growled. “One fucking birthmark.” When he glanced away, I noticed how pale he was. “One...really big birthmark.”\n “So I was right?” I laughed out loud. “That’s incredible. I am so awesome.”\n His scowl totally disagreed with me.\n I cleared my throat and calmed down because the topic clearly unsettled him. “Sorry. I just...I knew there had to be a reason you’d only do it in the dark, and...” I shook my head. “Does that actually work? I mean, none of the girls I overheard gossiping about you in the bathroom mentioned it, and they mentioned everything else, so I’m sure they would’ve. I can’t believe no one you’ve been with before has ever seen it.”\n He shrugged one of those uncomfortable, I-don’t-want-to-talk-about-it shrugs and wouldn’t meet my gaze. “Two other girls have seen it…besides Blondie.”\n My back straightened. “And why has Zoey seen your penis?”\n He opened his mouth to answer but paused when he saw my face. His lips quirked into a smirk. “Are you jealous? Of Blondie?”\n I sniffed and sent him a glower. “No.”\n Yes, totally.\n His grin only grew. “She walked in on me in the shower once; thought I was Hamilton.” Smile suddenly dimming, he glanced away. “To say the least, she totally flipped out. So did the other two.”\n I don’t know why it bothered me that three women had seen his penis, but it really, really did. I pulled back, my chest tight with pain, even as I forced casualness into my voice. “Oh, yeah? How’d they freak out?”\n “How do you think?” His gaze was hard and penetrating. Then he gave a hard, sniff-like, self-derisive laugh and shrugged. “The first time was...well, my first time. I didn’t even think about hiding it or being ashamed. I didn’t know it was a fucking abnormality. Everyone in my family knew about it and had seen me run around naked when I was younger. No one ever told me, ‘Hey, this could totally freak out some girl later on in your life.’”\n “So, she didn’t see it until after you two had...?” I motioned with my hands, wondering why I was talking about this with him while we were naked and in bed together, arguing about completely unrelated, more-important things…like our possible future together.\n “Right,” he said.\n “What’d she do?” I think the only reason I could ask was because I knew it had ended badly for him. If I had known he’d had a good time with her, I wouldn’t have been able to ask at all.\n “She screamed. Then she demanded to know what the hell was wrong with me and if it was contagious and...you know.” He glanced away, pale and serious. “All that shit.”\n I snorted. “What a bitch.”\n His gaze zipped back to me. “She was only sixteen.”\n That still didn’t excuse her in my book. She’d traumatized my Oren. The bitch must die...in my head anyway. I pictured myself pushing her off the side of a bridge and listening to her scream all the way down until...oops, she wasn’t screaming anymore.\n And yikes, I really did have issues, didn’t I?\n “And the next girl?”\n “Tianna,” he said.\n I seized up inside, not liking that I knew one of his past sluts’ names.\n Tianna, Tianna. The big, fat bitch-anna, I sang in my head.\n “She gave good head,” he went on, and yep, I really didn’t like knowing that. But he didn’t seem to know I was in the room anymore; he was trapped in a memory. “And she seemed okay with doing it in the dark until one night she pulled her cell phone out and turned on the light so she could see what she was doing.”\n “And she flipped out, too,” I guessed.\n Oren nodded. “Oh, yeah. Big time. Called me a freak and threatened to cut off my pecker if I’d given her an STD. All kinds of lovely shit. I actually had to blackmail that one to keep her trap shut about it.” He let out a small, depressed sigh. “She still really hates me.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-55.html","bookId":2714,"book":{"id":2714,"title":"A Perfect Ten (Forbidden Men #5)","description":"Storyline: \n Let your hair down, Caroline, they said. It\u0027ll be fun, they said. \n I know I\u0027ve closed myself off in a major way over the past year, ever since “the incident” where I messed up my life completely. It\u0027s past time I try to live again or just give up altogether. But this is quite possibly the craziest thing I\u0027ve ever done. In a last ditch effort to invigorate myself, I\u0027m standing outside Oren Tenning\u0027s bedroom, I just peeled off the sexiest pair of underwear I own, and my hand is already raised to knock. My brother would disown me for doing anything with his best friend, and he\u0027d probably kill Oren. But if I play my cards right, no one will ever know about this. Not even Ten. \n Maybe after tonight, I’ll finally get over this stupid, irrational crush I hate having on the biggest jerk I’ve ever met. Or maybe I’ll just end up falling for him even harder. Maybe I’ll discover there’s so much more to my crude, carefree hunk than meets the eye. \n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:49 AM"}}
