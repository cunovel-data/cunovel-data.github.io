I wanted to sob from the loss of her mouth, but yeah...I was a little too dazed by that smile. “Just call me Caroline Gamble, renowned cock whisperer.”\\n\\n I laughed. “You got that right. My cock definitely knows how to obey your every command.”\\n\\n Her amazing smile only grew. “And what would your cock do if I gave this command?” Letting go of my hips, she lay back onto her spine and spread her legs open until her little skirt fell up to her waist to remind me I’d taken off her panties already. When she touched herself, separating her pussy lips to show me how wet she was, I shook so hard I almost couldn’t tear open my condom package fast enough.\\n\\n “Fuck, woman. You’re going to kill me.”\\n\\n “And here I was only aiming to please you.”\\n\\n I paused between her legs and glanced up into her eyes. When she smiled again, I felt sucker punched hard in the chest. “You please me,” I said, meaning it more than I’d ever meant anything I’d said in my life. “You please me so fucking much.”\\n\\n I grabbed a handful of her hair at the base of her neck and kept her head captive so she was forced to look into my eyes. As her gaze widened with a knowing kind of shock, I pushed inside her. She pulled in a surprised gasp.\\n\\n I thrust slow and steady, making sure she felt every fucking centimeter of how much she satisfied me.\\n\\n “No one’s ever pleased me the way you please me. Every time with you is better than the last. I can’t even...God, Caroline. You own me.”\\n\\n “Oren.” She sobbed my name and threw her head back. When her inner muscles began to milk me, I ground my teeth.\\n\\n “Damn it. Not yet.”\\n\\n “I can’t...help it. Can’t stop.” She tried to restrain her orgasm, but it took her anyway, and I was unable to hold back either. Kissing her hard and running my hands over her face and hair, I emptied myself inside her.\\n\\n We clung to each other, riding the chaos until the room settled again. Then I panted out a breath and slumped on top of her, burying my face in her neck, right where she smelled the best.\\n\\n I have no clue how long we stayed like that. I was nearly unconscious and probably growing heavy on her, though, when she nudged my shoulder and giggled under me. “Oren. Baby, don’t fall asleep on me.”\\n\\n “Why not?” I slurred, burrowing into her a little more and making her giggle again.\\n\\n “You’re working, remember?”\\n\\n I lifted my head from her shoulder to look around Pick’s office. “Fuck.” I’d completely forgotten where we were. And I’d never locked the door, either.\\n\\n I jumped up off her, giving myself a head rush in my hurry. Then I tossed the condom and tucked myself back into my pants. As I was zipping up, I turned to Caroline in time to watch her fetch her panties off the floor. There was no way she’d be able to slip the shredded cloth back on, and I couldn’t help it; I grinned smugly.\\n\\n She scowled at me and waved them in my face. “Thanks a lot, asshole. You ruined them. What the hell am I supposed to do now?”\\n\\n I snatched them from her, glad to have the memento, and stuffed them into my pocket. “Looks like someone’s going commando for the rest of the night. Just make sure you don’t flirt with Hart again while you’re not wearing panties, or I’m really going to lose my shit and go all cave-man on you. I’ll probably toss you over my shoulder and drag you back to my lair, chain you to my bed and spank you daily.”\\n\\n She grinned and cupped my face in her hands. “I love it when you get jealous.”\\n\\n I snorted because I didn’t love it at all. I pretty much hated it. Jealousy was only hot when she wanted to cut a bitch for touching me, not the other way around. “You don’t know how douchebag Hart fucked with me earlier tonight, so I have a good reason to be pissed at him.”\\n\\n Her brow puckered in confusion. “Asher fucked with you? How?”\\n\\n Feeling like a petulant child who was tattling on a bully, I rested my face on her shoulder and slipped my hand around her waist, only to let my palm wander down until I had it under her skirt and smoothing across her bare bottom. “He figured us out when you enlisted him to help break into my phone. So to give me a hard time tonight, he tried to start a contest with me to see who could get the most chicks’ phone numbers by the end of the night, knowing I couldn’t say no in front of your brother.”\\n\\n When she tensed against me, I caught her elbow to keep her from going anywhere. “Don’t worry. I didn’t get a single number. I didn’t even try. The fucker just pissed me off for making the challenge in the first place.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5/page-98.html","bookId":2714,"book":{"id":2714,"title":"A Perfect Ten (Forbidden Men #5)","description":"Storyline: Let your hair down, Caroline, they said. It\u0027ll be fun, they said. \\n I know I\u0027ve closed myself off in a major way over the past year, ever since “the incident” where I messed up my life completely. It\u0027s past time I try to live again or just give up altogether. But this is quite possibly the craziest thing I\u0027ve ever done. In a last ditch effort to invigorate myself, I\u0027m standing outside Oren Tenning\u0027s bedroom, I just peeled off the sexiest pair of underwear I own, and my hand is already raised to knock. My brother would disown me for doing anything with his best friend, and he\u0027d probably kill Oren. But if I play my cards right, no one will ever know about this. Not even Ten. \\n Maybe after tonight, I’ll finally get over this stupid, irrational crush I hate having on the biggest jerk I’ve ever met. Or maybe I’ll just end up falling for him even harder. Maybe I’ll discover there’s so much more to my crude, carefree hunk than meets the eye. \\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5.jpg","author":"Linda Kage","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/a-perfect-ten-forbidden-men-5.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:59:12 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:49 AM"}}
