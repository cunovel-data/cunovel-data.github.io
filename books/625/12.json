This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection. \n \"What are you doing there?\" he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles. \n \"I am drinking,\" replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air. \n \"Why are you drinking?\" demanded the little prince. \n \"So that I may forget,\" replied the tippler. \n \"Forget what?\" inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him. \n \"Forget that I am ashamed,\" the tippler confessed, hanging his head. \n \"Ashamed of what?\" insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him. \n \"Ashamed of drinking!\" The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence. \n And the little prince went away, puzzled. \n \"The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd,\" he said to himself, as he continued on his journey. \n \n 小王子所访问的下一个星球上住着一个酒鬼。访问时间非常短，可是它却使小王子非常忧伤。 \n “你在干什么？”小王子问酒鬼，这个酒鬼默默地坐在那里，面前有一堆酒瓶子，有的装着酒，有的是空的。 \n “我喝酒。”他阴沉忧郁地回答道。 \n “你为什么喝酒？”小王子问道。 \n “为了忘却。”酒鬼回答。 \n 小王子已经有些可怜酒鬼。他问道：“忘却什么呢？” \n 酒鬼垂下脑袋坦白道：“为了忘却我的羞愧。” \n “你羞愧什么呢？”小王子很想救助他。 \n “我羞愧我喝酒。”酒鬼说完以后就再也不开口了。 \n 小王子迷惑不解地离开了。 \n 在旅途中，他自言自语地说道：“这些大人确实真叫怪。” \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2/153.html","bookId":625,"book":{"id":625,"title":"Little Prince小王子","description":"简介： 我请孩子们原谅我把这本书献给了一个大人。我有一个很重要的理由：这个大人是我在世界上最好的朋友。我还有另一个理由：这个大人他什么都能懂，甚至给孩子 们写的书他也能懂。我的第三个理由是：这个大人住在法国，他在那里挨饿、受冻。他很需要安慰。如果这些理由还不...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12854013765c48c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:56 AM"}}
