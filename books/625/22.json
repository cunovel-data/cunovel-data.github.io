Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes.\" \n \"Only the children know what they are looking for,\" said the little prince. \"They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody takes it away from them, they cry...\" \n \"They are lucky,\" the switchman said. \n \n “你好。”小王子说道。 \n “你好。”扳道工说道。 \n “你在这里做什么？”小王子问。 \n “我一包包地分选旅客，按每千人一包。”扳道工说，“我打发这些运载旅客的列车，一会儿发往右方，一会儿发往左方。” \n 这时，一列灯火明亮的快车，雷鸣般地响着，把扳道房震得颤颤悠悠。 \n “他们真匆忙呀，”小王子说，“他们要寻找什么？” \n “开机车的人自己也不知道。”扳道工说道。 \n 于是，第二列灯火通明的快车又朝着相反的方向轰隆轰隆地开过去。 \n “他们怎么又回来了呢？”小王子问道。 \n “他们不是原来那些人了。”扳道工说，“这是一次对开列车。” \n “他们不满意他们原来所住的地方吗？” \n “人们是从来也不会满意自己所在的地方的。”扳道工说。 \n 此时，第三趟灯火明亮的快车又隆隆而过。 \n “他们是在追随第一批旅客吗？”小王子问道。 \n “他们什么也不追随。”扳道工说，“他们在里面睡觉，或是在打哈欠。只有孩子们把鼻子贴在玻璃窗上往外看。” \n “只有孩子知道他们自己在寻找什么。”小王子说，“他们为一个布娃娃花费不少时间，这个布娃娃就成了很重要的东西，如果有人夺走的他们的布娃娃，他们就哭泣…” \n “他们真幸运。”扳道工说。 \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2/163.html","bookId":625,"book":{"id":625,"title":"Little Prince小王子","description":"简介： 我请孩子们原谅我把这本书献给了一个大人。我有一个很重要的理由：这个大人是我在世界上最好的朋友。我还有另一个理由：这个大人他什么都能懂，甚至给孩子 们写的书他也能懂。我的第三个理由是：这个大人住在法国，他在那里挨饿、受冻。他很需要安慰。如果这些理由还不...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/12854013765c48c.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:03 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:56 AM"}}
