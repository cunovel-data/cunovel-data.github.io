{"id":75459,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"With a great deal of pleasure, Cilla hung her first kitchen cabinet. \"Looking good.\" Thumbs hooked in his front pockets, Matt nodded approval. \"The natural cherry\u0027s going to work with the walnut trim.\" \"Wait until we get the doors on. Things of beauty. So worth the wait. Guy\u0027s an artist.\" She laid her level on the top, adjusted. \"It\u0027s beautiful work, and a lot of it.\" He scanned the space. \"But we\u0027ll get them in today. How long before the appliances are back?\" \"Three weeks, maybe four. Maybe six. You know how it goes.\" \"The old-timey stuff\u0027s going to be great in here.\" He winked at her as she stepped down off the ladder. \"Don\u0027t let Buddy tell you different.\" \"It\u0027ll give him something to complain about instead of my pot filler.\" She ran her hand, lovingly, over the next cabinet. \"Let\u0027s get her up.\" \"One second,\" Matt said as his phone rang. He glanced at the display. \"Hey, baby. What? When?\" The tone, the merging of the two words into one stream had Cilla looking over. \"Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I\u0027m on my way. Josie\u0027s water broke,\" he said, snappinghis phone off. \"I gotta go.\" He lifted Cilla off her feet, a happy boost into the air. \"So this is what goes on around here all day,\" Angie said as she came into the room. Matt just grinned like an idiot. \"Josie\u0027s having the baby.\" \"Oh! Oh! What\u0027re you doing here?\" \"Leaving.\" He dropped Cilla back on her feet. \"Call Ford, okay? He\u0027ll pass the word. I\u0027m sorry about-\" He gestured toward the cabinets. \"Don\u0027t worry about it.\" Cilla gave him a two-handed shove. \"Go! Go have a baby.\" \"We\u0027re having a girl. I\u0027m getting me a daughter today.\" He grabbed Angie on the way out, dipped her, kissed her, then swung her back up as he ran out of the room. \"Boy, talk about excellent timing.\" With a laugh, Angie tapped her lips. \"He gives good kiss. Wow, big, huge day. I need to call Suzanna, Josie\u0027s younger sister. We\u0027re friends. And another wow, look at all this!\" \"Coming along. Look around if you want. I need to call Ford.\" While Cilla made the call, Angie poked around the kitchen, in the utility room and back out. \"Men are odd,\" Cilla stated, hooking her phone back on her belt. \"He said, \u0027Cool. Got it. See ya.\u0027\" \"A man of few words.\" \"Not usually.\" \"Well, I\u0027ll use some to say, Cilla, this all looks amazing.\" Angie spread her arms. \"Totally amazing. And how the hell do you know where to put all these cabinets?\" \"Diagram.\" \"Yeah, but you had to make the diagram. I have a hard time figuring out if I can move my bed from one place to the other in my room, and where the dresser could go if I did.\" \"I had a hard time getting through a class, much less imagining teaching one the way you\u0027re going to do. We all know what we know.\" \"I guess we do. Well.\" Angie gave a snappy salute. \"Private McGowan reporting for duty.\" \"Sorry?\" \"I\u0027m here to paint. I could try to help you put these up now that Matt\u0027s otherwise occupied. But I think you\u0027ll be a lot happier with my painting skills than my cabinet-hanging ones. How do you hang them, anyway?\" she wondered. \"I mean, what holds them up? And never mind, I\u0027d rather use a paintbrush.\" \"Angie, you don\u0027t have to-\" \"I want to. Dad said they\u0027ve finished scraping the old paint on the front and one of the sides, and they\u0027ll be working on the back today. And if there was more help, we could get some of the primer on what\u0027s been done. It\u0027s my day off. I\u0027m the more help.\" She tugged at the leg of her baggy white painter\u0027s pants. \"Look. I have the outfit.\" \"As fetching as it is, I don\u0027t want you to feel obligated.\" Angie\u0027s face turned from teasing to solemn. \"Are you ever going to think of me as a sister?\" \"I do.\" Fumbling, Cilla picked up her level. \"Of course I do. I mean... we are sisters.\" \"If that\u0027s true, then let me say: Shut up, and show me the paint.\" Her smile went sly. \"Or I\u0027ll tell Dad you\u0027re being mean to me.\" Amusement came and went, but the quiet glow remained. \"You\u0027re a lot like him. The, ah, one who made us sisters.\" \"I have only his good qualities. You, on the other hand-\" \"The paint\u0027s out in the barn. We can go out this way.\" Cilla opened the back door. \"Maybe I don\u0027t like having a sister who\u0027s younger than I am and has a cute little cheerleader body.\" \"Maybe I don\u0027t like having a sister who has a yard of leg and miles of perfect hair. But I\u0027ve got a better ass.\" \"You do not. My ass is famous.\" \"Yeah, you showed enough of it in Terror at Deep Lake.\" \"I did no ass work in that picture. I wore a bikini.\" Holding back laughter, she stopped to pull out her keys, glanced over at the house. \"Oh, damn it!\" Turning to look, Angie gaped at the sight of her father, three stories up, standing on scaffolding, scraping away. \"Dad! Get down from there!\" They shouted it in unison. Gavin looked around, and down, then sent them a cheerful wave. \"I told him not to go up there. No scaffolding, no extension ladders.\" \"He doesn\u0027t listen, not when he\u0027s decided to do something. He pretends to listen, then does what he was going to do anyway. Is it safe?\" Angie asked, gripping Cilla\u0027s arm. \"I mean, it\u0027s not going to fall over or collapse, is it?\" \"No. But...\" \"Then we\u0027re not going to look. We\u0027re going to get the paint. I\u0027m going around to the front of the house, you\u0027re going inside. Where we can\u0027t see him up there. And we\u0027re never, never going to tell my mother.\" \"Okay.\" Cilla deliberately turned away, then stuck the key in the padlock on the barn. OLIVIA ROSE BREWSTER came into the world at 2:25 P.M. \"Matt\u0027s floating,\" Ford told Cilla as they drove to the hospital. \"Passing out bubble-gum cigars with this dopey smile on his face. The kid\u0027s pretty cute, got all this black hair. Ethan was bald as my uncle Edgar, but the girl, she\u0027s already got a headful.\" \"Uncle Ford seems pretty pleased, too.\" \"It\u0027s a kick. It\u0027s a pretty big kick. Josie looked pretty whipped when I saw her, right after.\" \"There\u0027s a surprise. She should have looked camera ready after pushing eight pounds, five ounces out of her-\" \"Okay, okay. No need for details.\" He hunted up a parking space in the hospital\u0027s lot. \"I talked with Matt while you were cleaning up. He said they\u0027re both doing great.\" \"It\u0027s nice to come back here for something happy.\" She skimmed her gaze up to the Intensive Care floor. \"Have you talked to Shanna since she got back?\" \"No, I haven\u0027t.\" \"She had a great time.\" Ford took Cilla\u0027s hand as they crossed the lot. \"She said Steve\u0027s looking good. Put some of the weight back on he lost, got what she called a Roman gladiator \u0027do going on. He\u0027s only using the cane when he gets tired.\" Ford pulled open the heavy glass door. \"I\u0027ve been e-mailing him pictures of the house. I need to take some of the kitchen cabinets. Gift shop. Presents for Mommy and baby.\" \"I took her flowers already,\" Ford objected, \"and a big pink teddy bear.\" \"Eight pounds, five ounces out of her-\" \"Gift shop.\" Loaded down with flowers, Mylar balloons, a plush musical lamb and a stack of coloring books for the new big brother, they walked into the birthing suite. Josie sat up in bed, in her arms the swaddled baby, a bright pink cap over her dark hair. Josie\u0027s younger sister stood nearby, cooing over a tiny, frothy white dress, while Brian unwrapped a bubble-gum cigar and Matt snapped a picture of his wife and daughter. \"More visitors!\" Josie beamed. \"Cilla, you just missed your dad and Patty.\" \"I came to see someone else.\" She leaned over the bed. \"Hello, Olivia. She\u0027s beautiful, Josie. You do wonderful work.\" \"Hey, she\u0027s got my chin, and nose,\" Matt claimed. \"And your big mouth. Do you want to hold her, Cilla?\" \"I thought you\u0027d never ask. Trade.\" She put the lamb on the bed, took the baby. \"Look at you. Look how pretty you are. How are you feeling, Josie?\" \"Good. Really good. Only seven and a half hours of blood, sweat and tears with this one. Ethan took twice that.\" \"Got some stuff here for big bro.\" Ford set the coloring books on the foot of the bed. \"Oh, that\u0027s so sweet! My parents just took him home for dinner. He looks so big, so sturdy. I can hardly... Oh, hormones still working,\" she managed when her eyes filled. \"It\u0027s a full house!\" Cathy announced as she and Tom came in with a bouquet of pink roses and baby\u0027s breath. \"Let me see that beautiful baby.\" Cilla turned obligingly. \"Oh, look at all that hair. Tom, just look at this sweet thing.\" \"Pretty as a picture.\" Tom set the flowers down among the garden of others, then poked Brian in the shoulder. \"When are you going to get busy making us one? Matt\u0027s got two up on you now. You, too, Ford.\" \"Slackers,\" Josie agreed, and held out her arms for Olivia. \"I have such high standards,\" Brian said. \"I can\u0027t settle for any woman who isn\u0027t as perfect as Mom.\" \"That\u0027s a clever way out of it,\" Cathy commented, but she beamed with pleasure as she stepped over to kiss Brian\u0027s cheek. She turned and kissed Matt. \"Congratulations.\" \"Thanks. We figured we had another week. When Josie called this morning, I figured it was to remind me to bring her home a caramel coconut sundae. She\u0027s been eating mountains of them.\" \"I have, too!\" Josie said with a laugh. \"It was peanut brittle for me. Acres of peanut brittle. I\u0027m lucky I have a tooth left in my head.\" \"Never touched it again after Brian was born,\" Tom commented. \"It\u0027ll probably be a good long while before I can look at coconut.\" Josie stroked Olivia\u0027s cheek. \"Thank God I didn\u0027t go another week.\" \"And now you\u0027ll be able to show off the baby at Cilla\u0027s party. We\u0027re all looking forward to that,\" Cathy added. \"I guess you could say the house is your baby.\" \"Without the pink teddy bear and pretty white dresses,\" Cilla agreed. Matt passed out more cigars. \"I had to bail out today. We\u0027d just started installing the kitchen cabinets. How\u0027s it going?\" \"We just have to set the island, put on the doors, the hardware. We\u0027ll be ready for the counters, on schedule.\" \"I\u0027m going to have a powwow with Patty and Ford\u0027s mother. And if you sweet-talk him,\" Cathy told Cilla, \"Tom might make his special ribs.\" Cilla smiled. \"What makes them special?\" \"It\u0027s all in the rub,\" Tom claimed. \"Family secret.\" \"He won\u0027t even give me the recipe.\" \"It passes down only through the bloodline. Many have tried to unlock the secret. None have succeeded. We\u0027ve got to be on our way, Cathy.\" \"Meeting friends for dinner. You get some rest, Josie. I\u0027ll pop in to see you and that precious baby tomorrow when I\u0027m here.\" It took several more minutes for the leave-taking, especially when other people came in. By the time Cilla and Ford walked out, she had a bubble-gum cigar in her pocket. \"It\u0027s nice that your parents-yours, Brian\u0027s, Matt\u0027s-take such an interest in all of you. It\u0027s almost tribal.\" \"We grew up practically joined at the hip, along with Shanna. Her parents split about ten years ago. They both remarried and moved out of the area.\" \"Still, three out of four sticking with it. Well above national average. They looked so happy. Matt and Josie. Little beams of happiness shooting out of their eyes. How long have they been married?\" \"About six years, I guess. But they\u0027ve had a thing a lot longer. Listen, if you want to stop and have dinner, that\u0027s okay.\" His fingers tapped on the steering wheel. \"But I\u0027d kind of like to get home.\" \"No, I\u0027m fine. Is something wrong?\" \"No. Nothing\u0027s wrong.\" Except a rampant case of nerves, he realized. And the sudden and inescapable understanding that he needed to take the next step, make the next move. Ready or not, he thought. Here it comes. HE POURED two glasses of wine, brought them out to the veranda where she sat rubbing Spock with her foot and studying the house across the road. \"The coat of primer on the front of the first story, on the veranda, doesn\u0027t add style. But it\u0027s clean. And it shows care and intent. It was the oddest thing, Ford, the oddest thing. To be working with one of Matt\u0027s crew on the cabinets, knowing my father was out back scraping old paint, and Angie was out front priming for new. Then Patty shows up at lunchtime with a bunch of subs and sides. Before they were fully devoured, she has a paintbrush in her hand. \"I didn\u0027t know what to think of it, what to make of it.\" \"Family pitches in.\" \"That\u0027s just it. For basically the first half of my life, family was an illusion. A stage set. I used to dream about my mother when I was a kid. Those lucid, conversational dreams I get. But she was on that set, part of that illusion, a combination of her and Lydia-the actress who played Katie\u0027s mother.\" \"Seems pretty much normal to me, given the circumstances.\" \"My therapist said my subconscious merged them because I was unhappy with the reality. Big duh, and it was more complicated than that. I wanted pieces of both those worlds. But I was me in them, not Katie. I was Cilla. Katie had her family, for eight seasons anyway.\" \"And Cilla didn\u0027t.\" \"It was a different kind of structure.\" A shaky one, she thought now. \"Later, I stepped away from it. I had to. And coming here, I stepped out again. It\u0027s strange trying to figure out how to blend in, or catch up, or sign on with family at this stage.\" \"Be mine.\" \"What?\" \"Be my family.\" He set the ring box on the table between them. \"Marry me.\" For an instant she wasn\u0027t capable of thought or speech, as if she\u0027d taken a sudden, shocking blow to the head. \"Oh my God, Ford.\" \"It\u0027s not a poisonous insect,\" he said when she snatched her hands away. \"Open it.\" \"Ford.\" \"Open it, Cilla. You\u0027re not supposed to piss a guy off when he\u0027s proposing. Thrill or crush, but not piss off.\" When she hesitated, Spock grumbled at her, and bumped his head into her shin. \"Just open it.\" She did, and in the soft dusk the ring gleamed like dreams. Lucid, lovely dreams. \"You don\u0027t wear jewelry much, and when you do, you don\u0027t go for the flash. You go more subtle, more classy.\" He felt that thing in his chest again, the hot rock of pressure he\u0027d experienced with her father in the kitchen. \"So I figure, you\u0027re not going to impress the girl with a big, fat rock. Plus you work with your hands, and that has to be considered. So having the diamonds set in instead of sticking up made sense. My mother helped me pick it out a few days ago.\" Yet another layer of panic coated her throat. \"Your mother.\" \"She\u0027s a woman. It\u0027s the first ring I\u0027ve bought for a woman, so I wanted some input. I liked the idea of the three stones. The past, the right now, the future. We\u0027ve got our yesterdays, we\u0027ve got our right now. I want a future with you. I love you.\" \"It\u0027s beautiful, Ford. It\u0027s absolutely beautiful. And the thought behind it makes it more so. I\u0027m such a bad bet.\" She reached over, took his hands. \"Even the idea of marriage freezes me up. I don\u0027t have the foundation for it. Look at what we were just talking about. You have two parents, with one marriage between them. You believe. I have two parents, with seven. Seven marriages between them. How can I believe?\" Strange, he thought, that her nerves, her fears and doubts dissolved the thing in his chest. \"That\u0027s bogus, Cilla. That\u0027s not you and me. Do you love me?\" \"Ford-\" \"It\u0027s not that hard a question. It\u0027s pretty much yes or no.\" \"It\u0027s simple for you. You can say yes, and it\u0027s simple. I can say yes. Yes, I love you, and it\u0027s incredibly scary. People love, and it falls apart.\" \"Yeah. And people love and it stays whole. It\u0027s just another step, Cilla. The next step.\" \"And this is meandering? Isn\u0027t that what you called it?\" \"I picked up the pace. That doesn\u0027t mean I can\u0027t wait.\" Ford closed the box, nudged it toward her. \"Take it. Keep it. Think about it.\" She stared at the box. \"You think I won\u0027t be able to resist opening it, looking at it. That I\u0027ll fall under its spell.\" He smiled. No wonder he loved her. \"Dare you.\" She closed her hands over the box and, breathing slowly, pushed it into her pocket. \"I\u0027m a has-been actress with a history of alcohol, drug abuse and suicide in my family. I don\u0027t know why in hell you\u0027d want me.\" \"I must be crazy.\" He lifted her hand, kissed it. In the spirit of the moment, Spock kissed her ankle. \"Every few days, I\u0027m going to just say, \u0027Well?\u0027 When I do, you can give me your current position on my proposal.\" \"The key word is \u0027well\u0027?\" \"That\u0027s right. Otherwise, I won\u0027t bring it up. You just carry the ring around, and you think about it. Deal?\" \"All right,\" she said after a moment. \"All right.\" He picked up his glass, tapped it to hers. \"Why don\u0027t we call out for Chinese?\" At their feet Spock did a happy dance. SHE DIDN\u0027T KNOW how he did it, she honestly didn\u0027t know. The man had proposed to her. He\u0027d presented her with a ring so utterly perfect for her, so completely right, because he\u0027d thought of her. Of who and what she was when he\u0027d chosen it. Her reaction, her reluctance- be honest, Cilla, she added, while screwing the copper knobs on her cabinets-her stuttering horror at his proposal had to have hurt him. And yet, after he\u0027d said his piece, after he\u0027d made his deal, he\u0027d ordered butterfly shrimp and kung pao chicken. He\u0027d eaten as if his stomach hadn\u0027t been in knots-as hers had been-then had suggested unwinding with the first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer (short season, summer replacement). And sometime during episode three, just as she\u0027d begun to relax enough to think about something other than the ring in her pocket, he\u0027d taken her under with slow, shimmering kisses, with lazy, lingering caresses. By the time she\u0027d come out of the sexual haze, the ring was all she could think about. Nearly twelve hours later, and she still couldn\u0027t get the damn thing off her mind. She didn\u0027t believe in marriage. Simple as that. Even living together was fraught with pitfalls. For God\u0027s sake, she\u0027d barely gotten used to him telling her he loved her, to believing it. She hadn\u0027t finished her house, or opened her business. She\u0027d gotten as far as she had while being harassed for months. Didn\u0027t she have enough on her mind? Didn\u0027t she have enough to do without having an engagement ring weighing down her pocket, and the worry of not knowing when Ford might say, \"Well?\" preying on her mind? \"Hello?\" \"Cilla?\" At the voices, Cilla simply banged her head repeatedly on the cabinet door. Perfect, she thought, just perfect. Patty and Ford\u0027s mother. Icing on her crumbling cake. \"Here you are,\" Patty said. \"Hard at work.\" Cilla watched as two pairs of eyes zoomed straight in on the third finger of her left hand. And watched two pairs of eyes cloud with disappointment. Great, now she was responsible for bringing sorrow into the lives of two middle-aged women. \"We were hoping you\u0027d have a few minutes to talk about the menu for the party,\" Patty began. \"We thought we could do at least some of the shopping for you, store the supplies since you don\u0027t have a place for them yet.\" You were hoping for more than that, Cilla thought. \"Let\u0027s get this out of the way. Yes, he asked me. Yes, the ring is absolutely beautiful. No, I\u0027m not wearing it. I can\u0027t.\" \"It doesn\u0027t fit?\" Penny asked. \"I don\u0027t know. I can\u0027t think about it. I can\u0027t not think about it. It was damn sneaky of him,\" she added with some heat. \"I appreciate- No, I don\u0027t just appreciate the two of you coming here like this, but I\u0027m trying to understand why you would. I\u0027ve got enough on my mind already, enough on my head, and he adds this. I don\u0027t even know if he listened to what I said, if he\u0027s getting the reasons why...\" She trailed off. He doesn\u0027t listen, Angie had said of their father, not when he\u0027s decided to do something. He pretends to listen, then does what he was going to do anyway. \"Oh, God. God, isn\u0027t that perfect? He\u0027s Dad. He\u0027s Dad with a layer of nerd. Solid, steady, chipping away so patiently, you don\u0027t even know you\u0027ve had your shields hacked down until you\u0027re defenseless. It\u0027s the type.\" \"You\u0027re not in love with a type, you\u0027re in love with a man,\" Penny corrected. \"Or you\u0027re not.\" Ford\u0027s mother, Cilla reminded herself. Be careful there. \"I love him enough to give him time to consider all the reasons this won\u0027t work. I don\u0027t want to hurt him.\" \"Of course you\u0027ll hurt him. He\u0027ll hurt you. It\u0027s all part of being connected to someone. I wouldn\u0027t want a man I couldn\u0027t hurt. I sure as hell wouldn\u0027t marry one who couldn\u0027t hurt me.\" Baffled, Cilla stared at Penny. \"That makes absolutely no sense to me.\" \"If and when it does, I think you\u0027ll be ready to see if the ring fits. I think your cabinets are beautiful, and they\u0027re giving me cabinet lust. Why don\u0027t we find somewhere to sit down, go over this menu for a few minutes. Then we\u0027ll get out of your way.\" Cilla sighed. \"Maybe he\u0027s not so much my father\u0027s type. Maybe he\u0027s you.\" \"No, indeed. I\u0027ve always been so much meaner than Ford. Let\u0027s sit out there.\" Penny pointed out the window. \"Under that blue umbrella.\" When Penny sailed out, Patty stepped closer to slip an arm around Cilla\u0027s waist. \"She loves her boy. She wants him happy.\" \"I know. So do I.\" MAYBE SHE SHOULD make a list, Cilla considered. Reasons for and reasons against taking the ring out of the box. She depended on lists, diagrams, drawings in every other area of her life. Surely it made sense to utilize one before making such a huge decision. The against list would be the easy part, she thought as she scooped up some post-workout, pre-workday Special K. She could probably fill pages with those items. She could, in fact, write a freaking book, as many others had, on the Hardy women. To be fair, there were a number for the pro side. But weren\u0027t they primarily, even exclusively, emotion-driven? And weren\u0027t her emotions twisted up with nerves because she was waiting-as he damn well knew- for him to stroll up to her at any point in any day and say, \"Well?\" Which he hadn\u0027t, not once, in days. So she jumped, nearly bobbled her bowl of cereal, when he strolled in. \"Too much coffee?\" he suggested, and poured himself a bowl of Frosted Flakes. Spock dashed straight in to attack his dog feeder. \"How do you eat that stuff? It looks like little twigs.\" \"As opposed to your choice, the vehicle for sugar?\" \"Exactly.\" Not only up at six in the morning, she thought, but cheerful and bright-eyed. And she knew he\u0027d worked late. But he was up, dressed and eating Frosted Flakes because he insisted on walking her across the road, hanging out until some of the crew arrived. Would that sort of thing go on the for or against list? \"You know I\u0027m not going to be attacked crossing the road at six-thirty in the morning.\" \"Odds are against it.\" He smiled, ate. \"And I know you worked late last night, and find it unnatural to be up at this hour of the morning.\" \"Had a good run, too. You know, I\u0027m finding that I can get a lot done by round-about noon most days with this routine. A habit which I intend to shed like a bad suit in what I hope is the near future. But right now?\" He paused to shovel in more Tony the Tiger. \"It\u0027s working. I should have ten chapters fully inked by the end of today and have time to put a couple of new teaser panels up on my website.\" \"Happy to help, but-\" \"You\u0027re looking for the negative. I like that about you because it pushes me to look on the brighter side of things-sides I might\u0027ve missed or taken for granted otherwise. You remind me I love what I do. And loving what I do, it\u0027s interesting to do more of it than usual for a space of time. And to pay us both back for all this industry, I\u0027ll be taking us to the Caymans-a favorite place of mine-right about the middle of January, where we\u0027ll soak up sea and sand while our neighbors are shoveling snow.\" \"I\u0027ll be finishing up two flips. I-\" \"You\u0027ll have to make time in your schedule. We can always bump sun and sea to February. I\u0027m easy.\" \"Not nearly as much as you pretend to be.\" She opened the dishwasher to load in her bowl, spoon, mug. \"You\u0027re a slow leak, Ford.\" His eyes continued to smile as he scooped up cereal. \"Is that what I am?\" \"A slow leak, unchecked, eventually eats through just about anything. Stone, metal, wood. It doesn\u0027t make much noise, and it\u0027s a long way from the big gushing flood. But it gets the job done.\" He shook his spoon at her. \"I\u0027m going to take that as a compliment. Kitchen counter\u0027s coming in today, right?\" \"This morning. Then Buddy\u0027s on for the finish plumbing this afternoon. \" He tucked his breakfast dishes in with hers. \"Big day. Let\u0027s get started. Walk!\" he said, lifting his voice, and Spock raced in to run in circles. She walked out with them, then stopped just to look at the Little Farm. Summer thrived over the grounds, lushly green. The big red barn stood, its practical lines softened by the curve of the stone wall, the textures of the plantings. She could see a hint of the pond, with the last vapors of dawn still rising, with the graceful bow of a young willow dipping. Back to the fields, wild with thistle and goldenrod, back to the mountains stretched across the morning sky. And the house, the centerpiece, rambling and sturdy, with its white veranda, and its front wall half painted in warm and dignified blue. \"I\u0027m glad my father talked me into painting the exterior ahead of schedule. I had no idea how much satisfaction it would give me to see it. When the painting\u0027s finished, it\u0027ll be like a strong old character actress after a really good face-lift.\" She laughed, the mood lightened, and she took his hand as they walked. \"One that allows her to maintain her dignity and personal style.\" \"I guess that\u0027s apt enough, considering all the cutting and stitching that went into it so far. But I don\u0027t get the whole face-lift thing.\" \"It\u0027s just another kind of maintenance.\" Alarm literally vibrated out of him. \"You wouldn\u0027t ever...\" \"Who knows?\" She shrugged. \"I\u0027m vain enough to want things to stay put, or have them shored up when they sag. My mother\u0027s had two already, in addition to other work.\" Amused by the stunned horror in his eyes, she gave him a nudge. \"A lot of men have work done, too.\" \"You can put that one away. Deeply buried in a remote location. Are you mailing something out?\" He nodded toward her mailbox and the raised red flag. \"No. That\u0027s funny. I didn\u0027t stick anything in there after yesterday\u0027s delivery. Maybe one of the guys did.\" \"Or someone put something in it for you. Not supposed to. Mail carrier doesn\u0027t like it.\" He veered over, reached for the lid. \"Wait! Don\u0027t!\" She grabbed his hand while her heart leaped up to pound in her throat. Beside them, Spock quivered and growled at the alarm in her tone. \"Rattlesnake in the mailbox. It\u0027s shorthand for the unexpected-an unpleasant, dangerous surprise.\" \"I know what it is. Code name for the season-three finale of Lost. Well... keep back some.\" \"Wait until I-\" But he didn\u0027t wait. Instead, he shifted his body, putting it between Cilla and the box, then yanked the lid down. No snake coiled and hissed inside. None struck out and slithered down the pole. The doll sat, her arms lifted as if in defense. The bright blue eyes were open, and the smile frozen on Cilla\u0027s young face. The bullet left a small, scorched hole in the center of the forehead.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tribute/page-27.html","bookId":2414,"book":{"id":2414,"title":"Tribute","description":"Storyline: Cilla McGowan, a former child star, has found a more satisfying life restoring homes. So she comes to Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley to save the dilapidated farmhouse that once belonged to her grandmother—a legendary actress who died of an overdose more than thirty years ago. Plunging into the project with gusto, Cilla’s almost too busy and exhausted to notice her neighbor, graphic novelist Ford Sawyer. Determined not to carry on the family tradition of ill-fated romances, Cilla steels herself against Ford’s quirky charm, though she can’t help indulging in a little fantasy. But it’s reality that holds its share of dangers for Cilla. A cache of unsigned letters found in the attic points to a mysterious romance in her grandmother’s life—and may be the catalyst for a frightening, violent assault. And if Cilla and Ford are unable to sort out who is targeting her and why, she may, like her world-famous grandmother, be cut down in the prime of her life.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/tribute.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/tribute.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:03 AM"}}
