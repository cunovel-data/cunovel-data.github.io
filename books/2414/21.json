{"id":75453,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"And though home is a name, a word, it is a strong one; stronger than magician ever spoke, or spirit ever answered to, in the strongest conjuration. - CHARLES DICKENS TWENTY-ONE How are you feeling?\" Wilson asked when she sat on the sofa with Ford, with the dog between them. \"Oddly enough, lucky.\" \"Have you been checked out by a doctor?\" \"No, it\u0027s bumps and bruises.\" \"It would be helpful to have a doctor\u0027s report, and photographs of your injuries.\" \"I don\u0027t have a local doctor yet. And I\u0027m not-\" \"I\u0027ve got one,\" Ford interrupted. \"I\u0027ll make a call.\" \"We interviewed Hennessy,\" Urick told them. \"Took a first pass at him. He doesn\u0027t deny ramming your truck or forcing you off the road. He claims you were harassing his wife.\" \"I went to see her this morning. I forgot,\" she said to Ford. \"It wasn\u0027t top of my mind after all this. I went to see him, actually, but she said he wasn\u0027t home. We had a conversation, out on her porch. Then I left. I didn\u0027t harass her, or anyone. And if he thinks having a conversation with his wife justifies running me into a ditch, he really is crazy.\" \"What time did you speak with Mrs. Hennessy?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Around nine. I left and did a number of errands. Four or five stops, I guess, between Front Royal and Morrow Village. I saw his van coming from the direction of my farm as I was heading toward it. He saw me, and a minute later he was behind me, coming up fast. He rammed me. I don\u0027t know how many times now. Three or four, at least. I know I was all over the road. I went into a skid, thought I was going to flip. I went into the ditch. I guess the seat belt and air bag kept it from being any worse.\" \"You got out of the truck,\" Wilson prompted. \"That\u0027s right. Supremely pissed. I started yelling at him, he yelled at me. And he shoved me. He shoved me again, and knocked me back into the gate of the truck. He said, \u0027I see you in there.\u0027 And he raised his fist. That\u0027s when I kicked him.\" \"What do you think he meant by that? \u0027I see you in there\u0027?\" \"My grandmother. He meant he saw my grandmother. And I\u0027d say if he had to hurt me to get to her, that\u0027s what he\u0027d do. He attacked my friend, vandalized my property, and now he\u0027s attacked me.\" \"He hasn\u0027t copped to any of the incidents before this afternoon,\" Wilson told her. \"He denies the rest.\" \"Do you believe him?\" \"No, but it\u0027s hard to understand why a man who confesses to vehicular assault, reckless endangerment, assault with intent refuses to admit to trespass and vandalism. The fact is, Ms. McGowan, he seemed righteous about what happened today. Not remorseful or afraid of the consequences. If his wife hadn\u0027t gotten a lawyer in there when she did, we might\u0027ve gotten more.\" \"What happens now?\" \"Arraignment, bail hearing. Given his age, his length of time in the community, I\u0027d expect his lawyer to request he be released on his own recognizance. And given the nature of the offense, his proximity to you, I expect the DA will ask for him to be held without bail. I can\u0027t say which way it\u0027ll go, or if it\u0027ll land somewhere between.\" \"His wife swears he didn\u0027t leave the house last night.\" Urick picked up the notebook in his lap. \"That they left the park right after they saw you, and he stayed in all night. We did, however, pull out of her that he often spends time in their son\u0027s room, locks himself in, sleeps in there. So he could\u0027ve left the house without her knowing about it. We\u0027ll push there, I promise you.\" Cilla had barely settled herself down after the police left when her father arrived, with Patty and Angie. Even as the anger and emotion level rose toward what she thought might be the unbearable, Ford\u0027s mother sailed in carrying a large Tupperware container and a bouquet of flowers. \"Don\u0027t you get up, you poor thing. I brought you some of my chicken soup.\" \"Oh, Penny, that\u0027s so thoughtful!\" Patty sprang up to take the flowers. \"I never thought of food, or flowers. I never thought-\" \"Of course you didn\u0027t. How could you, with so much on your mind? Cilla, I\u0027m going to heat you up a bowl right now. My chicken soup\u0027s good for anything. Colds, flu, bumps, bruises, lovers\u0027 spats and rainy days. Ford, find Patty a vase for the flowers. Nothing cheers you up like a bunch of sunflowers.\" Clutching them, Patty burst into tears. \"Oh now, now.\" Penny cradled the Tupperware in one arm, Patty in the other. \"Come on with me, sweetie. You come on with me. We\u0027ll make ourselves useful, and you\u0027ll feel better.\" \"Did you see her poor face?\" Patty sobbed as Penny led her away. \"She\u0027s just so upset.\" Angie sat beside Cilla, took her hand. \"I know. It\u0027s okay.\" \"It\u0027s not.\" Gavin turned from staring out the front windows. \"None of it is. I should have confronted Hennessy years ago, had this out with him. Instead, I just stayed out of his way. I looked away from it because it was uncomfortable. It was unpleasant. And because he left Patty and Angie alone. He didn\u0027t leave you alone, and still, I stayed out of his way.\" \"Confronting him wouldn\u0027t have changed anything.\" \"It would make me feel like less of a failure as your father.\" \"You\u0027re not-\" \"Angie,\" Gavin said, interrupting Cilla, \"would you go help your mother and Mrs. Sawyer?\" \"All right.\" \"Ford? Would you mind?\" With a nod, Ford slipped out behind Angie. Cilla sat, her stomach twisting with a new kind of tension. \"I know you\u0027re upset. We\u0027re all upset,\" she began. \"I let her have you. I let Dilly have you, and I walked away.\" Cilla looked into his face and asked the single question she\u0027d never dared ask him. \"Why?\" \"I told myself you were better off. I even believed it. I told myself you were where you belonged, and being there, being with your mother, allowed you to do what made you happy. Gave you advantages. I wasn\u0027t happy there, and whatever turned between your mother and me brought out the very worst in both of us when we dealt with each other. When we dealt with each other about you. I felt... free when I came back here.\" \"I was only about a year old when you moved out, and not even three when you went away.\" \"We couldn\u0027t speak two sentences to each other without it devolving. It was better, a little better, when we had a few thousand miles between us. I came out every month or two to see you for the first few... then less. You were already a working actor. It was easy to tell myself you had such a full life, to agree that it wasn\u0027t in your best interest to come here for part of your summer break when you could be making appearances.\" \"And you were building a life here.\" \"Yes, starting over, falling in love with Patty.\" He looked down at his hands, then dropped them to his sides. \"You were barely real to me, this beautiful little girl I\u0027d visit a few times a year. I could tell myself I did my duty-never failed to send the support check, or call on your birthday, Christmas, send gifts. Even if I knew it for a lie, I could tell myself. I had Angie. Right here, every step. She needed me, and you didn\u0027t.\" \"But I did.\" Cilla\u0027s eyes swam. \"I did.\" \"I know. And I\u0027ll never be able to make it up to you, or to myself.\" His voice went thick. \"I wanted a quiet life, Cilla. And I sacrificed you to get it. By the time I understood that, you were grown.\" \"Did you ever love me?\" He pressed his fingers to his eyes as if they burned, then, dropping his hands, walked over to sit beside her. \"I was in the delivery room when you were born. They put you in my arms, and I loved you. But it was almost a kind of awe. Amazement and terror and thrill. I remember most, a few weeks after we brought you home. I had an early call, and I heard you crying. The nurse had fed you, but you were fussy. I took you, and sat with you in the rocking chair. You spit up all over my shirt. And then you looked at me. Looked right into my eyes. And I loved you. I shouldn\u0027t have let you go.\" She took a breath as something opened in her chest. \"You helped me pick out rosebushes, and a red maple. You painted my living room. And you\u0027re here now.\" He put an arm around her, drew her against him. \"I saw you,\" he whispered, \"standing on a veranda you\u0027d built with your own hands. And I loved you.\" For the first time in her memory, for perhaps the first time in her life, she turned her face into his chest, and wept. LATER, SHE ATE CHICKEN SOUP. It surprised her just how much better it made her feel. A tall green vase full of bright yellow sunflowers didn\u0027t hurt, either. Cilla decided she looked a great deal better when Ford didn\u0027t argue with the idea of her walking over to check on what work had been done that day. \"Walking around some\u0027ll help you not stiffen up too much, I imagine.\" \"It\u0027s cooled off some. It feels good to be outside. Smells like rain\u0027s coming.\" \"Aren\u0027t you turning into the country girl.\" Smiling, she lifted her face to the sky. \"That, and like any contractor, I checked the weather channel this morning. Evening thunderstorms, sixty percent chance. And speaking of weather, you weathered the emotional storm earlier very well.\" \"Barely, if you want to know the truth. My mother\u0027s giving Patty the there-theres, and Angie gets going, and that gets my mother started. So I\u0027ve got three women crying in the kitchen while they\u0027re heating up soup and arranging flowers.\" Looking pained, he dragged a hand through his mass of disordered hair. \"I nearly bolted. Spock slunk out through his dog door like a coward. I thought about doing the same.\" \"Sterner stuff is Ford made of.\" \"Maybe, but it was touch and go when I looked in the living room to see if that coast was clear and you\u0027re mopping at your eyes.\" \"Thanks for sticking it out.\" \"It\u0027s what we men in love do.\" He unlocked the door, pushed it open. She paused in the doorway, as Spock made himself at home and walked straight in. \"Were you ever, before?\" \"Ever what?\" \"In love?\" \"I was in love with Ivy Lattimer when I was eight, but she treated me with derision and mockery. I was in love with Stephanie Provost at thirteen, who returned my affection for six glorious days before tossing me for Don Erbe and his in-ground swimming pool.\" She pressed her finger into his chest. \"I\u0027m serious.\" \"Those were very serious love affairs to me, at the time. There were others, too. But if you mean has it ever been real, have I ever looked at a woman and known and felt and wanted and needed all at the same time? No. You\u0027re the first.\" He lifted her hand, brushed his lips lightly over her knuckles and made her think of her father making the same gesture with Patty. \"Looks the same in here to me. What do these guys do all day?\" She wandered into the living room. \"Because you don\u0027t know where to look. Switch plates and outlet covers I special-ordered-hammered antique bronze-installed. That was a nice, unnecessary thing to do. Matt left the trim in here because he knows I have an emotional attachment to it and want to hang it myself.\" She moved off, let out a happy sound at the doorway to the powder room. \"Tile\u0027s laid.\" She crouched, studied. \"Nice, very nice, the warm pallet in this mosaic ties in well with the color of the entrance foyer, the living area. I wonder if they got to the bathroom on the third floor, or finished the drywall?\" And she\u0027s up and running, Ford thought, following her through the house. By the time she\u0027d checked everything to her satisfaction, the first rumble of thunder sounded. Spock let out a pip of distress and clung to Ford\u0027s side like a burr. She set the alarm, locked up. \"Wind\u0027s starting to kick. I love that. I really love when it waits to rain until night, and doesn\u0027t screw up time on the job. Brian\u0027s crew is scheduled for tomorrow, and we\u0027re finally going to work on the pond. Plus, we\u0027re... Oh damn, I completely forgot. I put an offer in on the house this morning. Just had the impulse hit, and hit strong enough, it said do it now. I should hear if they\u0027re going to counter tomorrow. Which is when I made an appointment for us to go through the other house. I figured if that didn\u0027t work for you, I\u0027d just reschedule. And I forgot about it.\" \"Gee, wonder why? What time tomorrow?\" \"Five. I\u0027ve got a full slate, so five worked out.\" \"It\u0027s fine. We\u0027ll go right after your doctor\u0027s appointment. That\u0027s at four.\" \"But-\" \"Four,\" he said in that tone she heard rarely. Which, she imagined, spoke to its success. \"Okay. All right.\" \"Now, what do you say we sit outside with some wine, and watch this storm roll in.\" \"I say that sounds like a nice way to end a seriously crappy day.\" CILLA THOUGHT SHE was pulling it together pretty well. She\u0027d gotten a decent night\u0027s sleep-maybe aided by two glasses of wine, two Motrin and another bowl of Penny\u0027s famous chicken soup. She\u0027d managed to creak her way out of bed at seven without waking Ford. Another spin in the whirlpool, some very light and gentle yoga stretches followed by more Motrin and a breathlessly hot shower had her feeling almost normal. Over a quiet cup of coffee she wondered why she needed a doctor\u0027s appointment. It didn\u0027t require a doctor to tell her she\u0027d been banged around and would be a little stiff and sore, a little achy for a couple of days. But she doubted Ford would see it that way. And wasn\u0027t that nice, when you got right down to it? There was someone who cared enough to get pushy and bossy about her welfare. It didn\u0027t hurt to be flexible, to bend enough to accommodate. Besides, the worst was over. Hennessy was in jail, and couldn\u0027t touch her or her property. She\u0027d be able to live, and finish her rehab in peace. And move on to the next. She\u0027d be able to sit down and really think about what it meant to have a man like Ford in love with her. And, yes, to worry and obsess about what it meant for her to be in love-if she really understood the state of being-with a man like Ford. They could take some time, couldn\u0027t they, to build on that? To restructure, to decide on tones and trim? They could take a good look at the foundation, evaluate. Because hers was so uneven. Lots of cracks there, she mused, but maybe they could be shored up, supported and repaired. Since his were so solid, so sturdy, there had to be a chance to make the whole thing stand. To make it last. She so badly wanted to make things last. She wrote him a note to prop against the coffeemaker. Feeling good. Gone to work. Cilla The truth would be closer to \"less crappy,\" but \"good\" worked well enough. She filled her insulated mug with coffee and headed for the door only two hours later than her usual start time. She jolted back a step. Mrs. Hennessy stood on the other side of the door, her hand lifted as if to knock. \"Mrs. Hennessy.\" \"Miss McGowan, I hoped you\u0027d be here. I need to talk to you.\" \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea, under the circumstances.\" \"Please. Please.\" Mrs. Hennessy opened the screen door herself, crowded in so that Cilla was forced to step back. \"I know you must be upset. I know you have every reason to be, but-\" \"Upset? Yeah, I\u0027d say I have every reason. Your husband tried to kill me.\" \"No. No. He lost his temper, and that\u0027s partly my fault. He was wrong. He was wrong to do what he did, but you have to understand, he wasn\u0027t thinking straight.\" \"When wasn\u0027t he thinking? When he drove out here in the first place, or when he rammed into my truck, repeatedly, until he ran me off the road? Or would it be when he shoved me? Or when he raised his fist to me?\" Mrs. Hennessy\u0027s eyes shone-fear, distress, apology. \"There\u0027s no excuse for what he did. I know that. I\u0027ve come here to beg you to have some pity, some compassion. To open your heart and understand his pain.\" \"You suffered a tragedy, over thirty years ago. And he blames me. How can I understand?\" \"Thirty years ago, thirty minutes ago. For him, there\u0027s no difference. Our son, our only child, lost his future that night. We could only have the one child. I had problems, and Jim, he said to me, it doesn\u0027t matter, Edie. We have everything. We have our Jimmy. He loved that boy more than anything in this world. Maybe he loved too much. Is that a sin? Is that wrong? Look, look.\" She pulled a framed photo out of her handbag, pushed it at Cilla. \"That\u0027s Jimmy. That\u0027s our boy. Look at him.\" \"Mrs. Hennessy-\" \"The spitting image of his daddy,\" she said quickly, urgently. \"Every-onesaid so, from the time he was born. He was such a good boy. So bright, so sweet, so funny. He was going to college, he was going on to college and to medical school. He was going to be a doctor. Jim and me, neither of us went to college. But we saved, we put money by so Jimmy could go. We were so proud.\" \"He was a handsome young man,\" Cilla managed, and handed the photo back. \"I\u0027m sorry about what happened. I\u0027m sincerely sorry. But I\u0027m not to blame.\" \"Of course you\u0027re not. Of course you\u0027re not.\" Tears trembling on the brink, she pressed the photo to her heart. \"I grieved, Miss McGowan, every day of my life, for what happened to my boy. Jimmy was never the same after that night. It was more than never walking again, or using his arms. He lost his light, his spark. He just never found himself again. I lost him, and I lost my husband that same night. He spent years tending to Jimmy. Most of the time he wouldn\u0027t let me do. It was for him to do. To feed him, to change him, to lift him. It took his heart. It just took his heart.\" She drew herself back up. \"When Jimmy died, I\u0027m not ashamed to tell you I felt some relief. As if my boy was finally free again, to be again, and walk and laugh. But what was left in my Jim just shriveled. Jimmy was his reason for being, even if the being was bitter. He snapped, that\u0027s all. The weight of it all, it just broke him. I\u0027m begging you, don\u0027t send him away to prison. He needs help. And time to heal. Don\u0027t take him, too. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027ll do.\" She covered her face, her shoulders shaking with sobs. Out of the corner of her eye, Cilla saw a movement. As Ford came down the stairs, Cilla held up a hand to stop him. \"Mrs. Hennessy, do you know what he did yesterday? Do you understand what he\u0027s done?\" \"I know what they\u0027re saying, and I know he hurt you yesterday. I shouldn\u0027t have told him you came. I was upset, and I started on him, how he had to let it go, leave it, and you. How I couldn\u0027t take you coming to the house that way. And he went storming off. If I hadn\u0027t riled him up-\" \"What about the other times?\" She shook her head. \"I don\u0027t know about other times. Can\u0027t you see he needs help? Can\u0027t you see he\u0027s sick in his heart, his mind, in his soul? I love my husband. I want him back. If he goes to prison, he\u0027ll die. He\u0027ll die there. You\u0027re young. You have everything ahead of you. We\u0027ve already lost the most important thing in our lives. Can\u0027t you find enough pity to let us try to find our peace?\" \"What do you think I can do?\" \"You could tell them you don\u0027t want him to go to jail.\" She reached out to grip Cilla\u0027s hands. \"The lawyer says he could ask for a psychiatric evaluation and time in a hospital. That they could send Jim to a place where they\u0027d help him. He\u0027d have to go, isn\u0027t that punishment? He\u0027d have to, but they\u0027d help him.\" \"I don\u0027t-\" \"And I\u0027d sell the house.\" Her hands squeezed Cilla\u0027s harder, and her desperation passed from skin to skin. \"I\u0027d swear it to you, on the Bible. I\u0027d sell the house and we\u0027d move away from here. When he\u0027s well enough, we\u0027d move to Florida. My sister and her husband, they\u0027re moving to Florida next fall. I\u0027ll find a place down there, and we\u0027ll move away. He\u0027ll never bother you again. You could tell them you want him to go to the psychiatric hospital until he\u0027s better. You\u0027re the one he hurt, so they\u0027d listen to you. \"I knew your grandmother. I know she loved her boy, too. I know she grieved for him. I know that in my heart. It\u0027s that Jim never believed it, and he blamed her, blamed her every time he looked at our boy in that wheelchair. He couldn\u0027t forgive, and it made him sick. Can\u0027t you forgive? Can\u0027t you?\" How could she hold against such need? Cilla thought. Such terrible need. \"I\u0027ll talk to the police. I can\u0027t promise anything. I\u0027ll talk to them. That\u0027s all I can do.\" \"God bless you. God bless you for that. I won\u0027t trouble you again. Jim won\u0027t, either. I swear it to you.\" Cilla closed her eyes, then closed the door. With a tired sigh, she walked over to sit on Ford\u0027s steps. She leaned her head on his shoulder when he stepped down to sit beside her. \"There are all kinds of assaults,\" he said quietly. \"On the body, the mind, and on the heart.\" She only nodded. He understood she felt battered by the visit, by the pleas, by the tears. \"It\u0027s about redemption, isn\u0027t it?\" she said. \"Or some part of it. Me coming here, bringing her house back. Myself back. Looking for her in it, for the answers, the reasons. She never recovered from Johnnie\u0027s death. Was never the same. And most people say she took her life because of it. Couldn\u0027t you say Hennessy didn\u0027t have that luxury? His child was still alive, but so damaged, so broken, so needy. He couldn\u0027t turn away from it, and had to live with it every day. And that broke him.\" \"I\u0027m not saying he doesn\u0027t need help,\" Ford said slowly. \"That mandatory time in a psychiatric facility isn\u0027t the answer. But, Cilla, it\u0027s not him who\u0027s asking for pity or forgiveness. It\u0027s not Hennessy who\u0027s looking for redemption.\" \"No, it\u0027s not.\" And there, too, she knew he was right. \"I\u0027m not doing it for him. For whatever good it does, I\u0027m doing it for that desperate and terrified woman. And more, I\u0027m doing it for Janet.\" IN CILLA\u0027S EXPERIENCE working with a good crew in construction meant no coddling because you happened to be female. She got questions, concern, anger and disgust on her behalf, but no more than she\u0027d have been afforded as a man. And she got plenty of jokes and comments about being a ballbuster. It helped put her back on track so she could spend the morning hanging trim. \"Hey, Cill.\" One of the laborers stuck his head in the living room as she stood on the stepladder nailing crown molding. \"There\u0027s a lady out here, says she knows you. Name\u0027s Lori. Want me to send her in or what?\" \"Yeah, tell her to come in.\" Cilla shot in the last nails, started down the ladder. \"If I\u0027d been through what you went through yesterday, I\u0027d be lying in bed, not climbing up ladders.\" \"It\u0027s just another kind of therapy.\" Cilla set the gun aside and turned to her Good Samaritan. \"I was going to come by later today or tomorrow, thank you again.\" \"You thanked me yesterday.\" \"Not to diminish what you did, but I\u0027m always going to have this image of you running down the road with a portable phone in one hand, and a garden stake in the other.\" With a laugh, Lori shook her head. \"My husband and I took this week off, short holiday week, to putter around the house and yard. He was off with our two boys buying peat moss and deer repellant while I restaked the tomatoes. I can tell you, if he\u0027d been home, he\u0027d likely\u0027ve beat that idiot over the head with the stake, even as he went down.\" With a sympathetic smile, she studied the bruise on Cilla\u0027s temple. \"That looks painful yet. How are you doing?\" \"Not too bad. I think it looks worse than it feels now.\" \"I hope so.\" She looked around the room. \"I confess, while I did want to see you, I\u0027ve always wanted a look inside this place.\" \"It\u0027s in major transition, but I\u0027ll give you a tour if you want.\" \"I\u0027d love a rain check on that. This room\u0027s very nice. I love the color. Well, let me just wind my way around to the point. Of course I know who you are, and who your grandmother was. We moved here about twelve years ago, but Janet Hardy\u0027s legend looms large, so we knew this had been hers. It\u0027s good to see somebody finally tending to it, which is not the point I\u0027m winding to.\" \"Is something wrong?\" \"I don\u0027t know, because while I know who you are, and feel a particular interest in you now, I don\u0027t know you. I\u0027ve had two reporters call me this morning, wanting quotes and information and my account of what happened yesterday.\" \"Oh. Of course.\" \"I told them I gave my account to the police. In both cases, they got pretty insistent, and that put my back up.\" \"I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re being bothered by this.\" Lori tossed up a hand, waved that aside. \"I stopped by to let you know that someone\u0027s been talking to reporters. For all I know you might\u0027ve talked to them yourself, though I can see now that\u0027s not the case.\" \"No, but I\u0027ll have to. I appreciate you letting me know.\" \"We\u0027re neighbors. I\u0027m going to let you get back to work.\" She glanced around. \"I think it\u0027s time to go nag my husband about painting the living room.\" Cilla walked Lori to the door, then went back and sat on the stepladder. She considered the cleanest, most direct way to get out a statement. She still had contacts, and even if tapping any of them was dicey, the Hardy name would ring the bell. She needed something brief and concise, carefully written. She\u0027d been taught not to duck a story but to confront it, spin it and ride it out with class. She pulled her phone off her belt when it rang, then closed her eyes as she answered. \"Hello, Mom.\" \"Cilla, for God\u0027s sake, what\u0027s going on out there?\" \"I had some trouble. I\u0027m handling it. Listen, could you contact your publicist? You\u0027re still using Kim Cohen?\" \"Yes, but-\" \"Please, contact her and give her this number. Ask her to call me as soon as she can.\" \"I don\u0027t see why I should do you any favors after the way you treated-\" \"Mom. Please. I could use some help.\" There was a beat of silence. \"All right. I\u0027ll call her right now. Were you in an accident? Are you in the hospital? Are you hurt? I heard some crazy man thought you were Mama\u0027s ghost and tried to run you over with his car. I heard-\" \"No, it\u0027s not like that. I\u0027m not hurt. I need Kim to help me straighten it out, get out a statement.\" \"I don\u0027t want you to be hurt. I\u0027m still mad at you,\" Dilly said with a sniff that made Cilla smile. \"But I don\u0027t want you to be hurt.\" \"I know, and I\u0027m not. Thanks for calling Kim.\" \"At least I know how to do a favor,\" Dilly said, and hung up. Cilla couldn\u0027t deny it as the publicist called within twenty minutes. In another twenty, they\u0027d refined a statement between them. By the time Cilla hung up, she knew she\u0027d done the best she could. \"I\u0027M NOT MAJOR JUICE,\" Cilla said to Ford as they drove from the doctor\u0027s office to the appointment with the realtor. \"But there\u0027s always some ripples when there\u0027s any sort of violence or scandal. And the Hardy connection may give it a little more play. But the statement should cover most of it. There won\u0027t be much interest.\" \"There will be locally. It\u0027ll be big news around here, at least for a few days. And if it goes to trial. Did you get in touch with the cops?\" \"Let\u0027s hope it doesn\u0027t-and yes. I know Wilson thought I was the crazy one for asking if they\u0027d consider Hennessy\u0027s emotional and mental state.\" \"What did he say?\" \"Psych evals are already in the works. One from the defense, one from the prosecution.\" \"Dueling shrinks.\" \"It sounds like it.\" \"I\u0027d say it\u0027s going to be pretty clear to both that Hennessy downed a big bowl of crazy.\" \"Yeah. I guess the upshot depends on what the prosecution\u0027s guy has to say as to whether or not the DA holds on the charges, makes a deal or recommends a psychiatric facility and treatment. The house is coming up on the left. The little Cape Cod there.\" \"Huh?\" \"Red compact out front. She\u0027s already here. Vicky Fowley. It\u0027s a rental-empty-the owner wants to unload. And Vicky\u0027s anxious to get it off her list.\" Ford looked at the overgrown, weedy front yard and the small brown box of a house sitting on it. \"I can\u0027t imagine why. Could it be the extreme uglies?\" \"Perfect attitude. Keep that up, seriously.\" She gave his hand a bolstering pat. \"And let me do the talking.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tribute/page-21.html","bookId":2414,"book":{"id":2414,"title":"Tribute","description":"Storyline: Cilla McGowan, a former child star, has found a more satisfying life restoring homes. So she comes to Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley to save the dilapidated farmhouse that once belonged to her grandmother—a legendary actress who died of an overdose more than thirty years ago. Plunging into the project with gusto, Cilla’s almost too busy and exhausted to notice her neighbor, graphic novelist Ford Sawyer. Determined not to carry on the family tradition of ill-fated romances, Cilla steels herself against Ford’s quirky charm, though she can’t help indulging in a little fantasy. But it’s reality that holds its share of dangers for Cilla. A cache of unsigned letters found in the attic points to a mysterious romance in her grandmother’s life—and may be the catalyst for a frightening, violent assault. And if Cilla and Ford are unable to sort out who is targeting her and why, she may, like her world-famous grandmother, be cut down in the prime of her life.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/tribute.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/tribute.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:03 AM"}}
