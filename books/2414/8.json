{"id":75440,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Cilla grew so accustomed to the cars that slowed or stopped at the end of her driveway she barely registered them. The lookie-loos, gawkers, even the ones she imagined took photos, didn\u0027t have to be a problem. Sooner or later, she thought, they\u0027d grow accustomed to her, so the best solution to her way of thinking was to ignore them, or to toss out the occasional and casual wave.\n To become part of the community, she determined, she had to demonstrate her intent and desire. So she shopped at the local supermarket, hired local labor, bought the majority of her materials from local sources. And chatted up the salesclerks, the subcontractors, and signed autographs for those who still thought of her as TV Katie.\n She considered it symbolic, a statement of that intent, when she took Ford\u0027s advice and followed her first instincts and had the gates removed. To follow up, she planted weeping cherry trees to flank the drive. A statement, Cilla thought, as she stood on the shoulder of the road and studied the results. New life. And next spring, when they burst into bloom again, she\u0027d be here to see it. From her vantage point, she looked down at the house. There would be gardens and young trees as well as the grand old magnolia. Her grand old magnolia, she thought, with its waxy white blooms sweetening the air. The paint on the house would be fresh and clean instead of dingy and peeling. Chairs on the veranda, and pots of mixed flowers. And when she could squeeze a little more out of the budget, pavers in earthy tones on the drive cutting through lush green lawns.\n Eventually, when people slowed down to look, it would be because they admired a pretty house in a pretty setting, and not because they wondered what the hell the Hollywood woman was doing with the house where Janet Hardy had swallowed too many pills and chased them with vodka.\n She stepped back toward the wall at the sound of an approaching car, then turned at the quick beep-beep as the little red Honda pulled to the shoulder.\n It took her a moment-and brought on a twist of guilt-to recognize the pretty blonde in cropped pants and a crocheted cami who hopped out of the car.\n \"Hi!\" On a bubble of laughter, Angela McGowan, Cilla\u0027s half sister, rushed forward to catch Cilla in a squeeze.\n \"Angie.\" The fresh, sassy scent enveloped her as completely as the arms. \"You cut your hair. Let me look at you. No! Don\u0027t hug me again. I\u0027m filthy.\"\n \"You really are.\" On another bubble of laughter, Angie pulled back, met Cilla\u0027s eyes with her own enormous hazel ones. Their father\u0027s eyes, Cilla thought. Their father\u0027s daughter. \"And you smell a little, too.\" Beaming, just beaming, Angie gripped Cilla\u0027s hands. \"You shouldn\u0027t still be so beautiful, considering.\"\n \"You look amazing.\" Cilla brushed her fingertips over the very abbreviated ends of Angie\u0027s hair. \"It\u0027s so short.\"\n \"Takes two seconds to deal with in the morning.\"Angie gave her head a quick shake so the sunny cap lifted, ruffled, settled. \"I had to practically have a blindfold and a cigarette to get it done.\"\n \"It\u0027s fabulous. What are you doing here? I thought you were at college?\"\n \"Semester\u0027s done for me, so I\u0027m home for a while. I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re here. And this.\" She gestured toward the house. \"You\u0027re actually living here, and fixing it up and... all.\"\n \"There\u0027s a lot of all.\"\n \"These are so pretty. So much prettier than that old gate.\" Angie touched one of the curved branches with its blossoms of soft, spring pink. \"Everyone\u0027s talking about what\u0027s going on here. I\u0027ve only been home for a day, and already I\u0027ve had my ears burned by all the talk.\"\n \"Good talk or bad talk?\"\n \"Why wouldn\u0027t it be good?\" Angie cocked her head. \"This place was an eyesore. So yeah, it\u0027s not so pretty right now, either, but you\u0027re doing something. Nobody else has. Is it hard? I don\u0027t mean the work, because obviously... I mean is it hard being here, living here?\"\n \"No.\" But Angie would ask, Cilla knew. Angie would care. \"In fact, it\u0027s easy. It feels right, more than anything or anywhere else. It\u0027s strange.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think so. I think everyone\u0027s supposed to be somewhere, and the lucky ones find out where it is. So you\u0027re lucky.\"\n \"I guess I am.\" The bright side of optimism, Cilla remembered, was where Angie lived. Her father\u0027s daughter. Their father\u0027s daughter, Cilla corrected. \"Do you want to come in, take a look? It\u0027s in serious flux right now, but we\u0027re making progress.\"\n \"I would, and I will another time. I\u0027m on my way to meet some friends, but I detoured, hoping to see you for a minute. Didn\u0027t expect to see you on the side of the road, so I guess I\u0027m lucky, too. So if... uh-oh.\"\n Cilla followed the direction of Angie\u0027s glance, noted the white van that slowed and pulled to the shoulder across the road.\n \"Do you know who that is?\" Cilla asked. \"I\u0027ve seen that van pull up out here before, several times before.\"\n \"Yeah, that\u0027s Mr. Hennessy\u0027s van. His son was-\"\n \"I know. One of the boys with Janet\u0027s son, in the accident. Okay. Stay here.\"\n \"Oh God, Cilla, don\u0027t go over there.\" Angie grabbed at Cilla\u0027s arm. \"He\u0027s just awful. Mean son of a bitch. I mean, sure, what happened was terrible, but he hates us.\"\n \"Us?\"\n \"All of us. It\u0027s a by-association kind of thing, Dad says. You should stay out of his way.\"\n \"He\u0027s in mine, Angie.\"\n Cilla crossed over, met the bitter eyes in the thin, pinched-mouth face through the windshield as she crossed to the driver\u0027s-side door. A lift van, she saw now. One designed to handle his son\u0027s wheelchair.\n The slope of the shoulder put her at a disadvantage-slightly off-balance and several inches lower than the man who glared out at her.\n \"Mr. Hennessy, I\u0027m Cilla McGowan.\"\n \"I know who you are. Look just like her, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"I was sorry to hear you lost your son last year.\"\n \"Lost him in 1972 when your worthless kin crushed his spine. Drunk and high and not giving a damn about anything but himself, because that\u0027s how he was raised. Not to give a damn.\"\n \"That may be. I know those three boys paid a terrible price that night. I can\u0027t-\"\n \"You\u0027re no better than she was, thinking you\u0027re better\u0027n anybody else \u0027cause you\u0027ve got money to spend, and expecting people to kowtow.\"\n The well of Cilla\u0027s sympathy began to dry up. \"You don\u0027t know me.\"\n \"Hell I don\u0027t. I know you, your kind, your blood. You think you can come here where that woman whored around, let her kids run like wolves, where she cost my boy his arms and legs, his life?\" His anger slapped out, bony fingers, in short, brittle blows. \"You think you can buy some wood, some paint and use it to cover up the stink of that place? Shoulda burned it down years back. Burned it to the godforsaken ground.\"\n \"It\u0027s a house, Mr. Hennessy. It\u0027s wood and glass.\"And you, she thought with no sympathy at all, are a lunatic.\n \"It\u0027s as cursed as she was. As you are.\" He spat out the window, barely missed the toe of Cilla\u0027s boot. \"Go back where you came from. We don\u0027t want you or your kind here.\"\n He pulled out so fast, fishtailing, that Cilla had to scramble back. She slid on the slope, lost her balance and went down on her knees as Angie ran across the road.\n \"Are you okay? Jesus, Jesus, he didn\u0027t hit you, did he?\"\n \"No. No.\" But her eyes were narrowed, iced blue, on the speeding van. \"I\u0027m fine.\"\n \"I\u0027m calling the police.\" Quivering with indignation, Angie pulled a hot pink cell phone out of her pocket. \"He spat at you! I saw him, and he nearly ran you over, and-\"\n \"Don\u0027t.\" Cilla put a hand to the phone as Angie flipped it open. \"Let it go.\" She sighed, rubbed at her knee. \"Just let it go.\"\n \"Are you hurt? You went down hard. We need to look at your knee.\"\n \"It\u0027s okay, Mom.\"\n \"Seriously. I\u0027ll drive you down to the house, and we\u0027ll see if you need to have it checked out. That old bastard.\"\n \"The knee\u0027s fine. I\u0027m not hurt, I\u0027m pissed off.\"\n As if to stabilize, Angie took a couple of whooshing breaths while she studied Cilla. \"You don\u0027t look pissed off.\"\n \"Believe me. Whoring around, wolves, cursed, your kin. Asshole.\"\n Angie laughed. \"That\u0027s more like it. I\u0027m driving you down to the house, now don\u0027t argue.\"\n \"Fine. Thanks. Does he act that way to you?\" Cilla asked as they crossed to Angie\u0027s Honda.\n \"He snarls and sends what you could call burning stares, mutters. No spitting. I know he\u0027s gone off on Dad. And I mean, God, do you know anybody with more compassion than Dad? Just because he was friends with Mr. Hennessy\u0027s son, and the rest of them, doesn\u0027t make him responsible for what happened. He wasn\u0027t even there that night. And clue in, you weren\u0027t even born.\"\n \"He\u0027s got the sins-of-the-father thing going, I\u0027d say. If he wants to drive by, stop and glower and think bad thoughts, let him.\"\n At the end of the drive, Cilla opened the car door. She took a breath herself now, and realized she felt better, more level, she supposed, with Angie there. \"Thanks, Angie.\"\n \"I want to look at your knee before I go.\"\n \"The knee\u0027s fine.\" To prove it, and to change the mood, Cilla swung into a quick tap routine on the patchy lawn, and ended with a flourish while Angie giggled.\n \"Wow. I guess it is fine.\"\n \"Nice stems, doll.\" Steve stepped onto the veranda, tattoos and tool belt. \"And who\u0027s your friend?\"\n \"We\u0027re not friends,\" Angie said, \"we\u0027re sisters.\"\n \"Angela McGowan, Steve Chensky. Steve\u0027s a friend from L.A. He\u0027s giving me a hand for a few days.\"\n \"Maybe longer.\" Steve smiled, big and bold.\n \"Angie\u0027s just home from college, and heading out to meet some friends.\"\n \"I am. I\u0027m late. You tell him about Mr. Hennessy,\" Angie ordered, climbing back into her car.\n \"Mr. who?\"\n \"I will. Have fun.\"\n \"That\u0027s the plan. I\u0027ll be back. Nice meeting you, Steve.\" With a wave out the window, she did a neat three-quarter turn and drove out.\n \"Your sister\u0027s hot.\"\n \"And barely legal, so hands off.\"\n \"\u0027Barely\u0027 would be the key word. You gotta love that McGowan DNA.\"\n \"No. No, you don\u0027t. How\u0027s it coming in the attic?\"\n \"It\u0027s fucking hot. They need to finish getting the AC up and running. But it\u0027s coming along. Get your tools, doll. Daylight\u0027s wasting.\"\n \"I\u0027m right behind you.\"\n HE\u0027D BEEN RIGHT about the heat. Cilla calculated she\u0027d dropped a couple of pounds in sweat alone by the time she unhooked her tool belt for the day. She treated herself to a long, cool shower in her one nearly completed bathroom. Paint and light fixtures yet to go. And thought about fixing herself an enormous sandwich.\n She ate it in solitary, pig-out splendor on her back veranda, and imagined the blooming shrubs, ornamental trees, the colorful plants in place of the hacked overgrowth. She imagined a rugged stone bench under the spread of the big sycamore and pictured the new slates and bricks on the patios and paths. The drip of willows at the pond, the shade of red maples, the glossy beauty of magnolias.\n Not cursed, she thought, rubbing lightly at the knee that was a little stiff and sore. Ignored, neglected for too long, but not cursed, despite the accusations of a bitter old man.\n She\u0027d put up a martin house, and hummingbird feeders. And the birds would come. She\u0027d plant a cutting garden with her own hands-after she researched what should be planted-and draw more birds and butterflies that would wing about as she harvested blooms for vases.\n She\u0027d buy a dog, one who\u0027d chase sticks and squirrels and rabbits, and she\u0027d have to chase him when he dug in the gardens. Maybe she\u0027d even see if she could hunt up an appealingly ugly one, like Spock.\n She\u0027d have parties with colored lights and music with people wandering through the house, over the lawn, filling it, filling it with sound and movement. Pulses and heartbeats and voices.\n And she\u0027d wake up every morning inside a home. Her home.\n She looked down at the paper plate in her lap, watched the tear plop. \"Oh God, what\u0027s this?\" She rubbed her hands over her wet cheeks, pressed them to the tightness in her chest. \"What\u0027s this, what\u0027s this?\"\n On the sagging veranda facing the ruined gardens, she sat alone while the sun slid toward the mountains. And gave in to the sobs. Meltdown, part of her brain thought. Had to happen.\n Dogs, people, colored lights? Failure was a lot more likely. No, the house wasn\u0027t cursed. It had good bones, good muscle. But wasn\u0027t she cursed? What had she ever done that mattered? What had she ever finished? She\u0027d fail here, too. Failure was what she did best.\n \"Stop it. Stop this crap.\"\n She choked back the next sob as she pushed to her feet. Grabbing the plate and the half-eaten sandwich, she marched inside, tossed them away. Breathing slowly, she splashed cold water on her face until it was drown or suck it up. Steadier, she went upstairs, deliberately applied makeup to conceal her pity bout, then picked up the copy of Gatsby.\n She carried it across the road and knocked on Ford\u0027s door.\n \"This is handy,\" he said when he came to the door. Spock stopped his aliens-at-the-door trembling and raced forward to press his body to Cilla\u0027s legs. \"I was just going over a short list of excuses, deciding which one to pick that covered going over to your place. I was sitting out back so I wouldn\u0027t appear to be obviously casing your house.\"\n She stepped in, handed him the book. \"You said I could keep this here.\"\n \"Sure. The letters?\"\n \"Yeah.\" Because the dog looked up at her with love shining in his protruding eyes, she crouched for a moment to scratch and rub him into ecstasy. \"I\u0027m in a mood. I don\u0027t want them in the house right now.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n \"Would you read them sometime, when you get a chance? I think I\u0027d like someone else\u0027s take.\"\n \"That\u0027s a relief. Now I don\u0027t have to fight a daily war between curiosity and integrity. I\u0027ll put them in my office. Do you want to come up a minute? I\u0027ve got some sketches I think you\u0027ll like.\"\n \"Yeah.\" Restless, she thought. She felt restless, itchy, a little headachy. Better to keep moving, keep doing. \"Yeah, why not?\"\n \"Want a beer, some wine?\"\n \"No, no. Nothing.\" Alcohol wasn\u0027t the best idea after a meltdown.\n \"Where\u0027s Steve? I thought I heard his bike a while back.\"\n \"He went out. He said he wanted some action, maybe he\u0027d play a little pool with some of the guys on the crew. I think he\u0027s hoping to get lucky with one of the landscapers. Her name\u0027s Shanna.\"\n \"Shanna and I go back. Not that way,\" he said quickly. \"Been friends since we were kids. Me, her, Bri, Matt.\"\n \"Nice. Nice to have friends you go back with. Oh. Wow.\"\n He had two boards loaded with sketches. Action poses, she thought. Mid-leap, mid-stride, mid-spin. In all she looked-there was no mistaking her face-she looked strong, fierce, bold and brilliant.\n Everything, she realized, everything she didn\u0027t feel at that moment.\n \"I\u0027m thinking tattoo. I got hung up on that. Now I\u0027m figuring out what and where.\" He tucked his hands in his back pockets as he gave the sketches a critical study. \"Small of the back, shoulder blade, biceps. I\u0027m thinking small and symbolic, and somewhere people wouldn\u0027t notice it on Cass. Or better, it\u0027s not on Cass, but forms when she changes to Brid. That way, it\u0027s not just a symbol but part of the power source.\"\n He narrowed his eyes as he scanned the sketches. \"I need to figure it out before I start on the panels. The story\u0027s outlined, and I like it. It holds up, but...\"\n Because Spock had begun to whine, Ford glanced over. And his trend of thought snapped into tiny pieces. Tears streamed down Cilla\u0027s face.\n \"Oh man. Crap. What? Why?\"\n \"Sorry. Sorry. I thought it was finished. I thought I was done.\" Backing up, she swiped at her cheeks. \"I have to go.\"\n \"No. Uh-uh.\" There might have been a hole spreading in the pit of his stomach, but he took her arm, and his grip was firm. \"What\u0027s the matter? What did I do?\"\n \"Everything. Nothing.\"\n \"Which?\"\n \"Everything\u0027s the matter. You did nothing. It\u0027s not you. It\u0027s me. It\u0027s me, me, me. That\u0027s not me.\" She gestured wildly toward the sketches. The tone, the gesture had Spock slinking over to his bed. \"I\u0027m nothing like that. I can\u0027t even gear myself up to have sex with you. Do you want to know why?\"\n \"I\u0027m pretty interested.\"\n \"Because I\u0027ll end up messing it up, ruining it, then I won\u0027t have anyone to talk to. I don\u0027t make things work. I screw up everything, fail at everything.\"\n \"Not from where I\u0027m standing.\" Baffled, he shook his head. \"Where\u0027s this coming from?\"\n \"From reality. From history. You don\u0027t know anything about it.\"\n \"So tell me.\"\n \"For God\u0027s sake, I was washed up at twelve. I had the tools, I had the platform, and I screwed it up. I failed.\"\n \"That\u0027s bullshit.\" His tone was matter-of-fact, and so much more comforting than soft sympathy. \"You\u0027re too smart to believe that.\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter that I know it\u0027s not true-exactly. But when you\u0027re told you\u0027re a failure over and over, you start believing it. That goddamn show was my family, then bam! Gone. I couldn\u0027t get it back, not the family, not the work. Then it\u0027s do concerts, live shows, and I can\u0027t. Stage fright, panic attacks. I wasn\u0027t going to take pills.\"\n \"What pills?\"\n \"God.\" She pressed her fingers to her eyes, grateful the tears had stopped. Spock slunk back over, dropped a half-chewed stuffed bear at her feet. \"My manager, my mother, people. You just need something to smooth the edges, to get you out there. So you can keep bringing in the money, keep your name in the public consciousness. But I wouldn\u0027t, I didn\u0027t, and that was that. So there\u0027s bad movies, horrible press-then worse from some viewpoints, no press. And Steve.\"\n Wound up, she tossed out her arms, paced the room. \"I jumped into marriage two seconds after I turned eighteen because finally, finally, here was someone who loved me, who cared, who understood. But I couldn\u0027t make that work.\n \"I tried college, and I hated it. I was miserable and I felt stupid. I wasn\u0027t prepared, and I didn\u0027t expect so many people to actually want me to fail. So I did. I matched their low expectations of me. One semester and I was out. Then there were voice-overs and humiliating bit parts. I\u0027d write a screenplay, no, couldn\u0027t do that, either. Photography, maybe? No, I sucked. I had income, thanks to Katie-and the fact, which I found out years later, that my father went to the wall to make sure my income was legally protected until I was of age.\n \"I was in therapy when I was fourteen. I thought about suicide at sixteen. Hot bath, pink candles, music, razor blade. Except after I got in the tub, I thought, this is just stupid. I don\u0027t want to die. So I just took a bath. I tried things. Maybe I could manage someone else, or do choreography. Name it. Tried it. Bombed. I don\u0027t get things done. I don\u0027t stick.\"\n \"Take a breather,\" Ford ordered, in such stern, authoritative tones she could only blink at him. \"You were a cute kid, a cute, talented kid on TV.\"\n \"Oh hell.\"\n \"Just shut up a minute. I don\u0027t know how these things work, exactly, but I\u0027d have to guess the show had run its course.\"\n \"And then some.\"\n \"But nobody took into account there was a kid involved, one who\u0027d grown up on that show and who had to feel as if she\u0027d been ripped away from her family. Orphaned. Who might feel it was her fault.\"\n \"I did. I really did. I know better, but-\"\n \"Anybody who offers much less pushes tranquilizers on a fourteen-year-old girl to get her to perform ought to be shot. There\u0027s no gray area there, not to me. You\u0027re not going to be able to claim those events as your failure. Sorry, they\u0027re off the list. Actually, it\u0027s a clean sweep,\" he continued as she stared at him. \"College didn\u0027t work, writing, photography, whatever. It\u0027s not failing, Cilla, it\u0027s trying. It\u0027s exploring. You had a marriage that didn\u0027t work, and you\u0027ve managed to remain friends-real friends-with the ex? That\u0027s a failure? See, that comes up strong in the plus column for me. And how about the houses back in California that you fixed up and sold? If you\u0027ve hit a snag across the road, you\u0027ll just have to unsnag it.\"\n \"I haven\u0027t.\" She pushed at her hair, managed to take a clear, easy breath. \"Things are actually going really well. I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m sorry. I can\u0027t believe I dumped all this on you. I had a meltdown earlier, and I thought I\u0027d finished it off. For some reason the sketches opened the floodgates again.\"\n She bent down, stroked Spock as he continued to look at her with great concern. She picked up the tattered little bear. \"This is disgusting.\"\n \"Yeah. He\u0027s had it awhile. He only gives it to people he loves.\"\n \"Well.\" She leaned forward, kissed Spock on the nose. \"Thanks, baby. Here, you better have it back.\"\n His tail wagged as if to say, Crisis over, and he took the bear back to his bed.\n \"What brought on the meltdown in the first place?\"\n \"Oh boy.\"\n She walked away from Ford, from the sketches, to the window. The sun had dipped down behind the mountains so its light haloed their dignified peaks. The sight of them-distant, a bit aloof-was comforting.\n \"My half sister stopped by today. Angie, who I often think of internally as my father\u0027s daughter. I don\u0027t often think of myself that way, or didn\u0027t. It was easier not to. She\u0027s so there. Happy, smart, pretty. A nice girl, but not so nice you can\u0027t stand being around her. I haven\u0027t made any particular effort there, or with my stepmother. Cards and an appropriate gift at Christmas and on birthdays. I didn\u0027t recognize her for a minute, she\u0027s cut her hair, but that wasn\u0027t why. Not really. I just blanked at first. I felt stiff and awkward, and she didn\u0027t. So I have to feel guilty about that, which makes me feel more stiff, more awkward, and she\u0027s just bubbling over, happy to see me. No pretense, no agenda.\"\n She sighed now, irritated with herself. Big whiny baby, she thought. Just can\u0027t stand that everything\u0027s going well. \"I\u0027d been congratulating myself on having the gates taken down-the symbol of it-and planting trees. Opening things up, putting in roots, looking to the future, and she made me realize I keep skimming over people and relationships, like a stone skipped over a river. Don\u0027t want to sink in.\"\n \"Maybe you\u0027re more treading water awhile now.\"\n She glanced back. He looked so damn good, she thought, in the ancient sweatshirt, torn jeans, ragged hair. \"Maybe I am. Anyway, while we\u0027re standing there talking, and I\u0027m trying to figure it out, Mr. Hennessy pulls up across the road. I\u0027ve seen his van out there before, just sitting there. Angie recognized it.\"\n She turned around. \"Did you know he\u0027s slapped out at my father and his family?\"\n \"No. Maybe. He\u0027s a hard man, Cilla.\"\n \"So I found out when I went over to talk to him. He pretty much blames me and all my kin, as he put it, for what happened to his son. The house is cursed, I\u0027m a whore like my grandmother, and so on. He actually spat at me.\"\n \"Bastard.\"\n \"I\u0027ll say. Then he pulls out so fast, I lost my balance, and Angie\u0027s all mother hen.\"\n \"You should call the cops. They\u0027ll talk to him.\"\n \"And tell him not to spit on my shoes? Better if I just make sure he doesn\u0027t have the chance to do it again. I\u0027m done feeling sorry for what happened to him before I was born. I thought I was just pissed off, went back to work and sweated it out. But later, I guess it just all hit, resulting in the massive pity event I\u0027ve just shared with you.\"\n \"I\u0027d call it a more medium-sized event, and that it illustrates you\u0027re way too hard on yourself. I don\u0027t know anything about building houses, but I do know the person in charge of what\u0027s going on across the road. She\u0027s no screwup. She\u0027s smart and bold and she works for what she wants. She may not have the mystical powers of the goddess but...\" He tapped one of the sketches. \"That\u0027s her. That\u0027s you, Cilla. Just the way I see you.\" He took down one of Brid, gripping a two-headed hammer in both hands, her face alive with power and purpose.\n \"Take this one, put it up somewhere. You feel one of the events coming on again, take a look at it. It\u0027s who you are.\"\n \"I have to say, you\u0027re the first person to see me as a warrior goddess.\"\n \"That\u0027s not all she is.\"\n Cilla looked from the sketch up into his eyes. There was tightness in her chest again, but not the sort that presaged tears. It was the flexing, she thought, of something starting to open again. \"Thanks for this, and for the rest. As payback...\"\n She turned, had his pulse bounding when she lifted the back of her shirt, bent just a little at the waist so her jeans gapped at the spine. And there, at the base, in deep blue, the three lines of the triple spiral curved.\n He felt the punch in his libido even as it hit the intellect. \"Celtic symbol of female power. Maid, mother, crone.\"\n She glanced over her shoulder, eyebrows cocked. \"Aren\u0027t you smart?\"\n \"I\u0027ve been researching.\" He stepped closer to study the tattoo. \"And that particular symbol was top of my list for Brid.

And if Cilla and Ford are unable to sort out who is targeting her and why, she may, like her world-famous grandmother, be cut down in the prime of her life.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/tribute.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/tribute.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:03 AM"}}
