{"id":75446,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"When Cilla showed Dobby the design she wanted for the medallions, he scratched his chin. And she saw his lips twitching at the corners.\\n\\n \"Shamrocks,\" she said.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve had me a few beers on Saint Patrick\u0027s Day in my time. I know they\u0027re shamrocks.\"\\n\\n \"I played around with other symbols. More formal, or more subtle, more elaborate. But I thought, screw that, I like shamrocks. They\u0027re simple and they\u0027re lucky. I think Janet would\u0027ve gotten a kick out of them.\"\\n\\n \"I expect she would. She seemed to like the simple when she was around here.\"\\n\\n \"Can you do it?\"\\n\\n \"I expect I can.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll want three.\" The idea made her giddy as a girl. \"Three\u0027s lucky, too. One for the dining room, one for the master bedroom, and one in here, in the living room. Three circles of shamrocks for each. I\u0027m not looking for uniformity but more symmetry. I\u0027ll leave it to you,\" she said when he nodded.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s good working on this place. Takes me back.\"\\n\\n They sat at a makeshift table, plywood over a pair of sawhorses. She\u0027d brought him a glass of tea, and they drank together while Jack finished up the last of the plaster repairs.\\n\\n \"You\u0027d see her around, when she came out to stay here?\"\\n\\n \"Now and again. She always had a word. Give you that smile and a hello, how are you.\"\\n\\n \"Dobby, in that last couple of years, when she came out, was there any talk about her being... friendly with a local man?\"\\n\\n \"You mean being sweet on one?\"\\n\\n Sweet on, Cilla thought. What a pretty way to put it. \"Yes, that\u0027s what I mean.\"\\n\\n The lines and folds on his face deepened with thought. \"Can\u0027t say so. After she died, and all those reporters came around, some of them liked to say so. But they said all kinds of things, and most weren\u0027t in the same neighborhood as the truth.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I have some information that makes me think she was sweet on someone. Very sweet. Can you think of anyone she spent time with in that last year, year and a half? She came out fairly often during that period.\"\\n\\n \"She did,\" he agreed. \"Talk was, after her boy died, the talk was she was going to sell the place. Didn\u0027t want to come here no more. But she didn\u0027t sell. Didn\u0027t have the parties or the people, either. Never brought the girl out again-that\u0027d be your mother-that I saw or heard about. The best I can recall, she came alone. If anybody had wind of her seeing a man from around here, their jaws would\u0027ve been working.\"\\n\\n \"Weren\u0027t so many people around to jaw back then,\" Jack commented as he set his trowel. \"I mean to say there weren\u0027t so many houses around the farm here. Isn\u0027t that right, Grandpa?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027d be true. Weren\u0027t houses on the fields across the road back then. Started planting them back twenty-five years on to thirty years back, I guess it was, when the Buckners sold their farm off.\"\\n\\n \"So there weren\u0027t any close neighbors.\"\\n\\n \"Buckners would\u0027ve been closest, I expect. About a quarter mile down.\"\\n\\n And that was interesting, Cilla decided. How hard could it be to have a secret affair when there were no nosy neighbors peeking out the window? The media would have been an extra challenge, but reporters hadn\u0027t been camped on the shoulder of the road seven days a week when Janet had traveled to the farm.\\n\\n According to what she\u0027d read or been told, Janet had been an expert at keeping certain areas of her private life private. After her death, facts, fallacies, rumors, secrets and innuendos abounded.\\n\\n And still, Cilla mused, the identity of Janet\u0027s last lover remained blank. Just how badly, she wondered, did she want to fill in that blank in her grandmother\u0027s life?\\n\\n Badly enough, she admitted. The answer to that single question could finally give clarity to the bigger question.\\n\\n Why did Janet Hardy die at thirty-nine?\\n\\n CILLA FOUND BRINGING Steve home both thrilling and terrifying. He was alive, and considered well enough to leave the hospital. Two weeks before, she\u0027d sat beside his bed, trying to will him out of a coma. Now she stood with him as he studied the farmhouse. He leaned on a cane, a ball cap on his head, dark glasses over his eyes, and his clothes bagging a bit from the weight he\u0027d lost in the hospital.\\n\\n She wanted to bundle him inside, into bed. And feed him soup.\\n\\n The terror came from wondering if she was competent enough to tend to him.\\n\\n \"Stop staring at me, Cill.\"\\n\\n \"You should probably get inside, out of the sun.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been inside, out of the sun. Feels good out here. I like the barn. Barns should always be red. Where the hell is everybody? Middle of the day, no trucks, no noise.\"\\n\\n \"I told all the subs to take me off today\u0027s schedule. I thought you\u0027d need a little peace and quiet.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, Cilla, when did I ever want peace and quiet? You\u0027re the one.\"\\n\\n \"Fine, I wanted peace and quiet. We\u0027re going in. You look shaky.\"\\n\\n \"Goes with the territory these days. I\u0027ve got it,\" he snapped at her when she started to take his free arm. He managed the stairs, crossed the veranda.\\n\\n The scowl smoothed away when he stepped inside the house, took his first look around.\\n\\n \"The plastering looks good. Getting rid of that door over there, widening the opening, that works for you. Better flow.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m thinking of using that area as a kind of morning room. It gets nice light. Then later on, if I\u0027m still inclined, I could add on a sunroom, put in a hot tub, a couple of machines, some nice plants. Down the road.\"\\n\\n \"Be sweet.\"\\n\\n And because she heard the strain in his voice, she nearly fussed about taking him up to bed. Instead she tried a different tack. The first step would be to get him upstairs.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve done a lot on the second floor. The master suite\u0027s really coming along. You\u0027ve got to see it.\"\\n\\n These steps were longer. She all but felt his weaker left side begin to tremble on the journey up. \"We should\u0027ve taken Ford up on his offer. You\u0027d be more comfortable at his place.\"\\n\\n \"I can walk up a damn flight of steps. Got a headache, that\u0027s all. Goes with the territory now, too.\"\\n\\n \"If you want to lie down... I\u0027ve got your pills right here.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to lie down. Yet.\" He pushed her offered hand aside. Again, some of the strain eased on his face when he studied the new bedroom space. \"You always had an eye. Good lines, good light. Nice closet, doll.\"\\n\\n \"A girl\u0027s best friend. I built the organizer yesterday.\" She opened the door, gave a Vanna White flourish.\\n\\n \"Cedar paneling. Good work.\"\\n\\n \"I learned from the best.\"\\n\\n He turned away to limp toward the bath, but she\u0027d seen the look in his eyes. \"What is it? What\u0027s wrong?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing. Sexy, classy,\" he said of the bathroom. \"Deco deal. Glass block for the shower wall? When did you decide on that?\"\\n\\n \"Last-minute change. I liked the effect, and the way it looks with the black-and-white tiles.\" She gave up, just leaned her forehead on his shoulder. \"Please tell me what\u0027s wrong.\"\\n\\n \"What if I can\u0027t do this anymore? If I can\u0027t handle the tools? It takes me longer to think, and these headaches about drop me.\"\\n\\n She wanted to hold him, hug him, nuzzle him into comfort. And instead flicked at him with mild annoyance. \"Steve, it\u0027s your first day out of the hospital. What did you think, you\u0027d walk out swinging a hammer?\"\\n\\n \"Something like that.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re on your feet. You\u0027re talking to me. The doctor said it\u0027s going to take time. Just as he said you\u0027ve already made an amazing recovery, and there\u0027s every reason to believe you\u0027ll get it all back.\"\\n\\n \"Could take months. Even years. And I can\u0027t remember.\" A trace of fear eked through frustration. \"Goddamn it, I can\u0027t remember anything that happened that night after I left here. Can\u0027t remember going to the bar, or hanging out, trailing Shanna home like she says I did. It\u0027s blank. I can remember getting on the bike. I can remember thinking I might just score with Shanna of the big brown eyes and amazing rack. Next thing I remember is you yelling at me, and your face leaning down over mine. Everything between is gone. Just gone.\"\\n\\n She shrugged, as if it was no big deal. \"If you\u0027re going to forget something, that would be the night.\"\\n\\n He smiled a little. \"Fricking ray of sunshine, aren\u0027t you? I\u0027m going to crash awhile, take some drugs and crash.\"\\n\\n \"Good idea.\"\\n\\n He let her take his weight to lead him to the guest room. Then stopped at the doorway. The walls were painted a soft and restful blue, as was the beadboard wainscoting. The original walnut trim, stripped and restored by her own hands, framed the windows. The floor gleamed, deep, rich and glossy. The iron headboard and footboard in dignified pewter suited the simple white and blue quilt, the star-patterned rug with its blue border. White daisies sprang up out of a cobalt vase on a table in front of the window.\\n\\n \"What the hell\u0027s this?\"\\n\\n \"Surprise. I think it\u0027s marginally more appealing than a hospital room.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a great room.\" Even as he jabbed a finger at her, pleasure shone on his face. \"What are you thinking, getting the floors refinished in one room?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m thinking it\u0027s nice to see one room finished-or nearly. Need some art for the walls, and I have to finish the rest of the trim, but otherwise. And check it out.\" She opened an old wardrobe, revealed a flat-screen TV. \"Got cable.\" She grinned at him. \"Digital, at Ford\u0027s insistence. The bath\u0027s finished, too. And looks great if I say so myself.\"\\n\\n Steve sat on the side of the bed. \"Going at rehab this way screws up the schedule.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not in a hurry.\" She poured a glass from the pitcher she\u0027d placed on the nightstand, then got out the pill bottle. \"Bottoms up, then we\u0027ll get you undressed and into bed.\"\\n\\n The faintest twinkle winked in his eyes. \"Time was you\u0027d\u0027ve gotten in with me, doll.\"\\n\\n \"Time was.\" She crouched down to take off his shoes.\\n\\n \"I want those subs back here tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Who made you job manager?\" Rising, she gestured so he lifted his arms. But she smiled as she drew off his shirt. \"They\u0027ll be back. They wanted to have a welcome-back party. Beer and subs. I scotched that. I guess I shouldn\u0027t have.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m ready to party.\" He lay back so she could take off his jeans. \"The day I can have a woman strip me down and not want to return the favor\u0027s not a day for partying.\"\\n\\n \"I give you a week.\" Now, no longer able to resist, she stroked his cheek. \"I heard how you hit on all the nurses.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s expected. I skipped Mike.\" He gave her a wan smile. \"Not that there\u0027s anything wrong with that.\"\\n\\n She turned down the bed, eased him into it, slipped off his shades, took the cap off his shaved head. The smooth dome marred by the line of stitches hurt her in every cell of her body. \"I\u0027m going to be downstairs doing some paperwork. You need anything, just call. If you want the TV, there\u0027s the remote. If you want anything, Steve, I\u0027m right here.\"\\n\\n \"Just a few z\u0027s for right now.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\" She kissed his forehead, then slipped out.\\n\\n Alone, he stared up at the ceiling. And, sighing, closed his eyes.\\n\\n Cilla took her laptop outside to work. Though she snuck up to check on Steve twice in the first hour, she made headway with bills and cost projections. When she heard the crunch of feet on gravel, she glanced up to see Ford and Spock.\\n\\n \"Hi, neighbor,\" he called out. \"I figured if you were out here, the returning hero\u0027s doing all right.\"\\n\\n \"Sleeping.\" She looked at her watch. \"God, how did it get to be five o\u0027clock?\"\\n\\n \"The earth orbits around the sun as it turns on its axis, thereby-\"\\n\\n \"Smart-ass.\"\\n\\n \"Present. And speaking of.\" He shook the bag in his hand. \"I\u0027ve got something for Steve. Some DVDs, since you\u0027ve got the set up in his room.\"\\n\\n Cilla cocked her head. \"DVDs? Porn?\"\\n\\n Ford\u0027s eyebrows drew together. \"Porn\u0027s such a hard word. Just hear how it comes out of the mouth. That short, hard syllable. Spider-Man, the three-movie box set. It seemed appropriate. And a couple of others that involve naked women and motorcycles, which I\u0027d call adult entertainment. Spock picked those out.\"\\n\\n She slid her glance down to the dog, who cocked his head and looked innocent. \"I\u0027m sure Steve will appreciate them.\"\\n\\n \"Spock believes Sleazy Rider was very underrated.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take his word.\" She heard the footsteps first, sprang to her feet. She pulled open the screen door as Steve reached for it from the inside. \"You\u0027re up. Why didn\u0027t you call me? You shouldn\u0027t take the steps by yourself.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m good. Ford.\"\\n\\n \"Good to see you out.\"\\n\\n \"Good to be. Hey, Spock. Hey, boy.\" He sat on one of the white plastic chairs, stroking the dog, who laid his front legs on Steve\u0027s knee.\\n\\n \"You look better,\" Cilla decided.\\n\\n \"Magic pills and sleep. I nap like a three-year-old these days, but it does the job.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re probably hungry. Why don\u0027t I fix you some food? Something to drink? Get you-\"\\n\\n \"Cill.\" He started to tell her not to bother, changed his mind. \"Yeah, I could use a sandwich or something. Not hospital food or smuggled-in goods. Maybe you could throw something together for all of us.\"\\n\\n \"Sure. Give me a few minutes.\"\\n\\n When she dashed inside, Steve shook his head. \"She\u0027s hovering, man.\"\\n\\n \"I talked her out of the little bedside john.\"\\n\\n \"I owe you. What\u0027s in the bag?\"\\n\\n Ford passed it over, and after a quick look, Steve broke out in a grin. \"Now we\u0027re talking. Thanks. Listen, I need to get the exercise in. You spot me on a walk around?\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n Ford waited until Steve handled the stairs, then walked with him away from the house. \"Something on your mind?\"\\n\\n \"Lots of shit, man. It still gets a little bogged coming through the channels. Cops don\u0027t have dick, right?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027d be about it.\"\\n\\n \"It looks like a one-time thing. Just bad luck. I mean, nothing\u0027s happened since.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n Steve stared at Ford\u0027s profile. \"You\u0027d tell me straight?\"\\n\\n Ford thought of Cilla\u0027s car door, but set it aside. \"Nobody\u0027s broken into the barn, bothered the house.\"\\n\\n \"You were bunking here while I was in the hospital. I got word on that.\"\\n\\n \"Hey. My sleeping bag.\"\\n\\n \"So you and Cilla aren\u0027t in the sack?\"\\n\\n \"Not quite yet.\"\\n\\n \"But you\u0027re into her. Look, that\u0027s your business, her business and all that bullcrap, but I\u0027m asking because I need to know if you\u0027re going to look out for her when I\u0027m gone.\"\\n\\n Ford paused as Steve did. \"Going somewhere?\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t said anything to her yet. I was going to when we got back, but Jesus, she fixed up the room for me. Down to flowers, you know. Oh, and thanks for the push on the cable.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s only right.\"\\n\\n With a nod, Steve began to walk again. \"The thing is, I should\u0027ve headed back last week, latest. Plans changed on account of brain surgery. I\u0027d stay if I thought she needed me to watch out for her, or I could help out. She can take care of herself, that\u0027s Christ\u0027s truth, but... Hell, maybe it\u0027s the near-death experience. Whatever. I want to get home. I want to sit on the beach, soak up the rays. But I need to know somebody\u0027s got her back.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got her back, Steve.\"\\n\\n Steve stopped to stare at the barn. \"She said you bought the paint. While I was still out of it.\" He nodded, as if satisfied. \"You\u0027re all right, Ford. Totally not the type she usually lets get a taste. It\u0027s about time. She digs on candles. When you\u0027re making it,\" Steve added. \"She digs on lots of candles around. Doesn\u0027t mind music, either. Doesn\u0027t need it, like some do, but she\u0027s good with it. Lights on, lights off; she\u0027s okay either way. But she does dig on the candle thing.\"\\n\\n Ford cleared his throat. \"Appreciate the tips. How are you getting back to L.A.?\"\\n\\n \"The doc wants to see me Friday, so I\u0027m going to stick till Saturday. I\u0027ve got a friend in New Jersey who\u0027s coming down in an RV. We\u0027ll load me and the bike up, head west. Don\u0027t say anything to her, okay? I want to tell her myself.\"\\n\\n Cilla whistled from the veranda. \"You guys want to eat?\"\\n\\n Spock\u0027s answer was to run toward her as if hellhounds were on his heels.\\n\\n \"The mountains are cool,\" Steve commented as they turned back.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s part of what pulled her out east. She told me how the mountains seem like home. Me? I miss the ocean.\" He nudged Ford with his elbow. \"And the women in very small bikinis.\"\\n\\n SHE SLEPT POORLY, with one ear cocked for Steve, and her mind niggling over the fact he planned on leaving in a matter of days.\\n\\n How could she take care of him if he was three thousand miles away?\\n\\n One day out of the hospital, and he was planning cross-country trips. In an RV? It was so like him, she thought as she tossed over onto her back. Always had to move, never stay in one place too long. That\u0027s where the whole flipping houses came from, she reminded herself. You didn\u0027t have to settle on one if you kept turning them.\\n\\n But he wouldn\u0027t listen to reason on this. And the fact that he was just out of the damn hospital made it impossible to kick his ass. Who\u0027d check on him two or three times a night as she\u0027d done? So he\u0027d been fine when she had. What if he hadn\u0027t been?\\n\\n She rolled over again, punched her pillow. And gave up.\\n\\n Dawn was about to break anyway. She\u0027d go check on him again, then go down and make some coffee. She\u0027d have her quiet time outside before the crew started piling in.\\n\\n As she heard Steve snoring before she reached his doorway, she headed straight for coffee. In another few months, she thought, she\u0027d have an actual kitchen. Refitted antique appliances, countertops, cabinets. Actual dishes. And damn if she wasn\u0027t treating herself to a fancy espresso maker.\\n\\n Maybe she\u0027d actually learn how to cook. She\u0027d bet Patty could teach her some good basics. Nothing fancy and gourmet. She\u0027d tried that route and failed spectacularly. But your basic red sauce, or meat and potatoes. Surely she could learn how to cook a chicken breast.\\n\\n Once the house was finished, she promised herself. Once she had her license, geared up for business, found a routine. She\u0027d learn how to cook for herself instead of living on sandwiches, canned soup and takeout.\\n\\n She carried the coffee outside, drawing in its scent as the first sleepy light played over her new gardens, over earth still turned and waiting. She sipped while the mists rose off the pond she still had to clean.\\n\\n Every day, she thought. She wanted to do this every day. To step out of her home in the soft, sleepy light and see what she could do, what she had done. What had been given to her.\\n\\n Whatever she\u0027d paid her mother for this place, this life, didn\u0027t count. In that soft and sleepy light, she knew everything she could see and smell and touch had been a gift from the grandmother she\u0027d never met.\\n\\n She would\u0027ve taken coffee on a morning walk, Cilla thought as she stepped off the veranda to wander. Accounts spoke of her as an early riser, used to the demands of filming. Often up at dawn.\\n\\n Often up till dawn, too, Cilla admitted. But that was another side of the woman. The party girl, the Hollywood queen, the star who drank too much and leaned too heavily on pills.\\n\\n In the quiet morning, Cilla wanted the company of the Janet Hardy who fell in love with this little slice of Virginia. Who brought home a mongrel pup and had roses planted under the window.\\n\\n The big red barn made her smile as she strolled around the house. The police tape was gone, the padlock firmly in place. And Steve, she thought, was snoring in the pretty iron bed in the pretty room upstairs.\\n\\n That nightmare was done. A scavenger looking for scraps who\u0027d panicked. The police believed that to be the case, so who was she to argue? If she wanted to solve a personal mystery, it would be the author of the letters inside Gatsby. And in that way, she\u0027d put another piece of Janet\u0027s together, for her own knowledge. Her own history.\\n\\n The light grew as she neared the front of the house. Birdsong sweetened the air as did the scent of roses and turned earth. Dew tickled coolly on her bare feet. It pleased her more than she could say to know she walked on her own land, over dewed grass, wearing a tank and cotton pajama pants.\\n\\n And no one cared.\\n\\n She finished the coffee on the front veranda, gazing out over the lawn.\\n\\n Her smile faded slowly, changing into a puzzled frown as her eyes scanned the front wall.\\n\\n Where were her trees? She should be able to see the bowing tops of her weeping cherries from the veranda. As the frown deepened, she set her mug on the rail, stepped down to walk along the lawn beside the gravel drive.\\n\\n Then she began to run.\\n\\n \"No. Goddamn it, no!\"\\n\\n Her young weepers lay on the narrow swatch of green between her wall and the shoulder of the road. Their slender trunks bore the hack marks of an ax. It wouldn\u0027t have taken much, she thought as she crouched down to brush her fingers over the leaves. Three or four swings at most.\\n\\n Not to steal. Digging them up would have taken a bit more time, a bit more trouble. To destroy. To kill.\\n\\n The sheer meanness of the act twisted in her belly in a combination of sorrow and fury. Not a scavenger, she thought. Not kids. Kids bashed mailboxes along the road, so she\u0027d been warned. Kids didn\u0027t take the time to hack down a couple of ornamental trees.\\n\\n She straightened to take a steadying breath, and looked over at the broken stump of one of her dying trees. That breath caught. Her body trembled, that same combination of sorrow and fury. Black paint defiled the old stone wall with its ugly message.\\n\\n GO BACK TO HOLLYWOOD BITCH!\\n\\n LIVE LIKE A WHORE DIE LIKE A WHORE\\n\\n \"Fuck you,\" she said under her breath. \"Goddamn it, Hennessy, fuck you.\"\\n\\n Riding on pure fury now, she stormed back to the house to call the police.\\n\\n WITH BLOOD IN HER EYE, Cilla warned every one of the crew that anyone who mentioned the trees or the wall to Steve would be fired on the spot. No exceptions, no excuses.\\n\\n She ordered Brian back to the nursery. She wanted two new trees planted, and she wanted them planted that very day.\\n\\n By ten, when the cops had come and gone, secure that her threat would hold and that the crew would keep Steve busy inside, she went out to work with the mason on cleaning the stone.\\n\\n Ford saw her, scrubbing at the stone, when he stepped out with his first cup of coffee. And he saw the message sprayed over the wall. As she had done earlier, he left his coffee on the rail and jogged down to her in bare feet.\\n\\n \"Cilla.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tell Steve. That\u0027s the first thing. I don\u0027t want you to say a word about this to Steve.\"\\n\\n \"Did you call the cops?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027ve been here. For whatever good it does. It has to be Hennessy, it has to be that son of a bitch. But unless he\u0027s got black paint and wood chips under his goddamn fingernails, what are they going to do about it?\"\\n\\n \"Wood...\" He saw the stumps then, swore. \"Wait a minute. Let me think.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have time. I have to get this off. Can\u0027t risk sandblasting this stone. It\u0027s too harsh. It\u0027d damage the stone, the mortar, do as much harm, potentially, as the stupid paint. This chemical\u0027s the best alternative. Probably have to have the wall repointed, but it\u0027s all I can do.\"\\n\\n \"Scrub at the stone with a brush?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right.\" She attacked the C in BITCH like she would a sworn enemy. \"He\u0027s not going to get away with this. He\u0027s not going to soil or damage what\u0027s mine. I wasn\u0027t driving the goddamn car. I wasn\u0027t even born, for Christ\u0027s sake.\"\\n\\n \"And he\u0027s eighty if he\u0027s a day. I have a hard time seeing him chopping down a couple of trees and tagging a stone wall in the middle of the night.\"\\n\\n \"Who else?\" She rounded on Ford. \"Who else hates me or this place the way he does?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. But we\u0027d better work on finding out.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s my problem.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be an ass.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s my problem, my wall, my trees. I\u0027m the bitch.\"\\n\\n He met her hot glare with a cool stare. \"I wouldn\u0027t argue with the last part right at the moment, but as for the rest? Bullshit. You don\u0027t want to tell Steve, fine. I get it. But I\u0027m not leaving. I\u0027m not heading back to L.A. or anywhere else.\"\\n\\n He grabbed her arm, pulled her back around to face him. \"I\u0027m staying right here. Deal with it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying to deal with this, and with having my best friend leave when he can hardly walk more than five yards at a time. I\u0027m trying to deal with making a life I didn\u0027t even realize I wanted until a few months ago.

So she comes to Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley to save the dilapidated farmhouse that once belonged to her grandmother—a legendary actress who died of an overdose more than thirty years ago. \\n Plunging into the project with gusto, Cilla’s almost too busy and exhausted to notice her neighbor, graphic novelist Ford Sawyer. Determined not to carry on the family tradition of ill-fated romances, Cilla steels herself against Ford’s quirky charm, though she can’t help indulging in a little fantasy. \\n But it’s reality that holds its share of dangers for Cilla. A cache of unsigned letters found in the attic points to a mysterious romance in her grandmother’s life—and may be the catalyst for a frightening, violent assault. And if Cilla and Ford are unable to sort out who is targeting her and why, she may, like her world-famous grandmother, be cut down in the prime of her life.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/tribute.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/tribute.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:03 AM"}}
