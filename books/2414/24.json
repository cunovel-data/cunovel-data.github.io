{"id":75456,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"Every day brought visitors. Some she welcomed, and some she ignored. There was little she could do but ignore those who parked or stood on the shoulder of the road taking pictures of the house, the grounds, of her. She shrugged off the members of the crew who entertained themselves by posing. She couldn\u0027t blame them for getting a kick out of it, for grabbing a portion of that fifteen minutes of fame.\\n\\n Sooner or later, she told herself, the interest would die down. When she caught sight of paparazzi stalking her while she shopped for hardware or lumber, she didn\u0027t acknowledge them. When she saw pictures of her home, of herself in the tabloids or gossip magazines, she turned her mind to other things. And when her mother\u0027s publicist called with requests for interviews and photo layouts, Cilla firmly hung up.\\n\\n She went about her business, and prayed that one of the current Hollywood crop of bad girls would do something outrageous enough to shift the attention. As July sweated its way toward August, she concentrated on the house. She had plenty to do.\\n\\n \"Why do you want a sink over here,\" Buddy demanded, \"when you\u0027re putting a sink over there?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a prep sink, Buddy, and I don\u0027t honestly know why I want one.\\n\\n I just do. Sink here.\" She laid a fingertip on the revised, and absolutely final, drawing of her kitchen. \"Dishwasher here. Refrigerator. And over here, the prep sink in the work island.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s your business.\" He said it in the way, as he often did, that told her she didn\u0027t know squat. \"But I\u0027m just saying, if you\u0027re putting this here island in, you\u0027re cutting into your counter space by putting a sink into it.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll have a cutting-board top. On when I want to chop something, off when I want to wash something.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, Buddy. Um, vegetables.\"\\n\\n He gave her his bulldog frown. \"Then what\u0027re you going to wash in the other sink?\"\\n\\n \"The blood off my hands after I stab you to death with my screwdriver. \"\\n\\n His lips twitched. \"You got some weird-ass ideas.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah? Wait for this one. I want a pot-filler faucet.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to have two damn sinks, and you want one of them gadgets that swings out on an arm from the wall over the stove to fill pans with water?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I do. Maybe I want to fill really big pots with water for pasta, or for washing my damn feet. Or for boiling the heads of cranky plumbers who argue with me. Maybe I\u0027ve developed a faucet fetish. But I want it.\"\\n\\n She walked over, tapped her fist on the wall where she\u0027d drawn a circle with an X in it with a carpenter\u0027s pencil. \"And I want it right here.\"\\n\\n He cast his eyes to the ceiling, as if asking God what possessed her. \"Gonna have to run pipes, so we\u0027re gonna have to cut that plaster to run \u0027em down, tie \u0027em in.\"\\n\\n \"I know that.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s your house.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. It is.\"\\n\\n \"I heard you bought another one, that old place out on Bing.\"\\n\\n \"It looks that way.\" The little flutter in the belly signaled excitement and nerves. \"We don\u0027t settle until October, but it looks that way.\"\\n\\n \"I guess you\u0027ll be wanting your fancy doodads in that one, too.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be pleased to know I plan to go more basic there.\" She had to fold her lips when she caught the disappointment on his face.\\n\\n \"You say that now. Well, I can start the rough-in on Thursday.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027d be great.\"\\n\\n She left him to his scowling and calculations.\\n\\n The kitchen cabinets should be done in a couple weeks, she estimated, and could be stored, if necessary, while the plumbing, the wiring were roughed, inspected, finished, inspected. The plaster repaired, the painting done, the floors laid. If her countertops came in on schedule, she might have a finished kitchen, excepting the refitted appliances, by Labor Day.\\n\\n Maybe she\u0027d have a party after all. And even thinking about planning a party probably jinxed the entire thing.\\n\\n \"Knock, knock!\" Cathy Morrow poked her head in the front door. \"Brian said you wouldn\u0027t mind if I came right in.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t. How are you?\"\\n\\n \"Just fine, except for dying of curiosity. Brian\u0027s been telling us how wonderful everything looks, so Tom and I just had to come by and see for ourselves. Tom\u0027s out there in the back where you\u0027re having the stone wall built up. For shrubs, Brian said.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll add height and depth to the yard and cut back on the mowing.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think Brian\u0027s ever done so much work for a private client-noncommercial, I mean. He\u0027s just... Oh, Cilla! This is just beautiful.\"\\n\\n With a flush of pride, Cilla watched Cathy walk around the living room. \"It\u0027s finished except for refinishing the floor, and we\u0027ll do all of them at the same time. And for furniture, and accessories, art, window treatments and a few minor details such as...\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s so open and warm. I love the light. Are those shamrocks on the collar, or whatever you call it?\"\\n\\n \"Medallion, and yes. Dobby did an amazing job. And the fixture\u0027s true to the architecture of the house. I don\u0027t know what was there originally. I couldn\u0027t find any pictures showing it, and my father couldn\u0027t remember. But I think the straightforward Arts and Crafts lines and the design, with the diamond shapes of amber and deep blue, work.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just lovely. But, oh my God, the fireplace.\"\\n\\n \"Focal point.\" Walking over, Cilla stroked her hand down the deep blue of the granite. \"I wanted it to pop against the walls, the way the sky pops against the mountains. And a strong color like this needed a strong mantel.\"\\n\\n \"Wasn\u0027t it... Yes, it was brick before.\"\\n\\n \"Smoke-stained and pocked, and the hearth didn\u0027t meet code, which you can see by the burn marks from stray embers in the floor.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s funny, all I remember about this room, or the house, really, was so up-to-the-minute. The long sofa in lipstick pink with white satin pillows. I was so impressed. And the way Janet looked sitting on it in a blue dress. She was so beautiful. Well, everyone was,\" Cathy added with a laugh. \"The celebrities, the rich and famous and important. I couldn\u0027t believe I was here. We were only invited because Tom\u0027s father was a very important local figure, but I didn\u0027t care why. We were invited here three times, and every time was almost painfully exciting.\\n\\n \"Lord, I was younger than you the last time I was here-in that era, I mean. So much time between,\" she said with a wistful sigh. \"The last time was a Christmas party. All the decorations, the lights. Champagne, endless glasses of champagne, music. That amazing couch. People begged her to sing until she gave in. There was a white baby grand over by the window, and... Oh! Who was it, who was it everyone thought she was having a blistering affair with... the composer? And it turned out he was gay. He died of AIDS.\"\\n\\n \"Lenny Eisner.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, yes. God, gorgeous man. Anyway, he played, and she sang. Magic. It would\u0027ve been the Christmas before your uncle was killed.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Cathy said suddenly. \"I\u0027m daydreaming out loud.\"\\n\\n \"No, I like hearing about the way it was. The way she was.\"\\n\\n Cathy tucked back her swing of glossy hair. \"I can tell you no one shone brighter than Janet. I think, yes, Marianna was just a few weeks old, and it was the first time we\u0027d gotten a sitter. I was so nervous about leaving her, and so self-conscious because I still had all that baby weight on me. But Janet asked me about the baby, and told me how pretty I looked. It was kind of her, as I\u0027d blown up like a whale with Marianna, and was barely down to hippo. And I remember because my mother-in-law nagged me about eating so many canapes. How would I lose the weight if I ate so much? Irritating woman. Oh, but Tom\u0027s father, I remember, too, how handsome he looked that night. So robust and dashing, and how Janet flirted with him, which irritated my mother-in-law and pleased me to no end.\"\\n\\n She let out a laugh now, tickled by the memory. \"We never did take, Tom\u0027s mother and I. Yes, he did look handsome that night. You\u0027d never have believed cancer would take him so horribly just twelve years later. They stood right in here, Janet and Drew-Andrew, Tom\u0027s daddy. And then they were both gone.\\n\\n \"Now, I am sorry. How did I take such a morbid turn?\"\\n\\n \"Old houses. They\u0027re full of life and death.\"\\n\\n \"I suppose you\u0027re right. It\u0027s about life now, isn\u0027t it, and what you\u0027re doing here. Oh, I completely forgot. I brought you two mimosas.\"\\n\\n \"You brought me drinks?\"\\n\\n Cathy laughed until she had to hold her stomach. \"No. Trees. Well, they will be trees in a few years, if you want them. I started a couple dozen of them from seed, to give as gifts. I have a pair of lovely old mimosas. You may not want to bother with them, and I won\u0027t be offended if you don\u0027t. They\u0027re barely ten inches high at this point, and you won\u0027t see blooms for several years.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d love to have them.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re out on your veranda in some old plastic pots. Why don\u0027t we take them around to Brian, see where he thinks they\u0027d do best for you?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re my first housewarming gift.\" Cilla led the way out, and picked up one of the black plastic pots holding the delicate, fanning seedling. \"I love the idea of planting them so young, and being able to watch them grow, year after year. It\u0027s funny, you coming by, talking about the parties. I was thinking about having one, maybe for Labor Day.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, you should! What fun.\"\\n\\n \"Problem being, the house won\u0027t be completely finished, and I won\u0027t have it furnished or decorated, or-\"\\n\\n \"Who cares about that!\" Obviously already in the swing, Cathy gave Cilla an elbow bump. \"You can have another when you\u0027re all done. It\u0027d be like... a prelude. I\u0027d be happy to help, and you know Patty would. Ford\u0027s mother, too. In fact, we\u0027d take over if you didn\u0027t whip us back.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe. Maybe. I\u0027ll think about it.\"\\n\\n AFTER THE CREWS HAD GONE, and the house fell silent, after two fragile seedlings with their pink, powder-puff blossoms still years from bloom had been planted in a sunny spot bordering the yard and fallow field, Cilla sat on an overturned bucket in the living room of the house that had once been her grandmother\u0027s. The house now hers.\\n\\n She imagined it crowded with people, beautifully dressed, beautifully coiffed. The colored lights of Christmas, the elegance of candle and firelight glowing, glittering, glimmering.\\n\\n A lipstick-pink couch with white satin pillows.\\n\\n And Janet, a light brighter than all the rest, gliding from guest to guest in elegant blue, a crystal glass bubbling with champagne in her hand.\\n\\n The granddaughter sat on the overturned bucket, hearing the dream voices and drawing in the ghost scents of Christmas pine.\\n\\n Ford found her, alone in the center of the room, in light going dim with the late summer evening.\\n\\n Too alone, he thought. Not just solitary, not this time. Not quietly contemplative, and not basking, but absolutely alone, and very, very away.\\n\\n Because he wanted her back, he walked over, crouched in front of her. Those spectacular eyes stared for another instant, two more, at what was away, then came back, came back to him.\\n\\n \"There was a Christmas party,\" she said. \"It must have been the last Christmas party she gave, because it was the Christmas before Johnnie was killed. There were lights and music, crowds of people. Beautiful people. Canapes and champagne. She sang for them, with Lenny Eisner on the piano. She had a pink couch. A long, bright pink couch with white satin pillows. Cathy told me about it. It sounds so Doris Day, doesn\u0027t it? Bright pink, lipstick pink. It would never go in here now, that bright pink with these foggy green walls.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just paint, Cilla; it\u0027s just fabric.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s statements. Fashions change, go in and out, but there are statements. I\u0027d never be a pink couch with white satin pillows. I changed it, and I\u0027m not sorry about that. It\u0027ll never be as elegant or bold and bright as it was, with her. I\u0027m okay with that, too. But sometimes, when it\u0027s me in here, I need-and I know this sounds completely insane-but I need to ask her if she\u0027s okay with it, too.\"\\n\\n \"Is she?\"\\n\\n She smiled, laid her brow against his. \"She\u0027s thinking about it.\" She sat back, sighed. \"Well, since I\u0027m making crazy statements, I might as well lead up to asking you a crazy question.\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s sit outside on the crazy-question section of the veranda. There\u0027s too damn much of me to squat down this way for long.\" He pulled her to her feet.\\n\\n They sat on the veranda steps, legs stretched out, with Spock wandering the front yard. \"You\u0027re sure this is the crazy-question section?\"\\n\\n \"I have season tickets.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. Did you know Brian\u0027s grandfather? His father\u0027s father?\"\\n\\n \"Barely. He died when we were just kids. I have more of an impression of him. Big, strapping guy. Powerful.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027d have been about, what, sixty that Christmas? That last Christmas party.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. About, I guess. Why?\"\\n\\n \"Not too old,\" Cilla considered. \"Janet liked older men, and younger, and just about any age, race or creed.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re thinking Bri\u0027s grandfather and Janet Hardy?\" His laugh was surprise and wonder. \"That\u0027s just... weird.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Okay, imagining grandparents having affairs, which means imagining grandparents having sex, is weird to begin with.\"\\n\\n \"Not so much when your grandmother is forever thirty-nine.\"\\n\\n \"Point.\"\\n\\n \"Besides, grandparents have sex. They\u0027re entitled to have sex.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but I don\u0027t want to fix the image in my head, or the next thing I\u0027ll be imagining my grandparents doing it, and see? See?\" He gave her a mock punch on the arm. \"There it is, in HDTV, in my head. Now I\u0027m scarred for life. Thanks very much.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, definitely the crazy section of the veranda. Ford, he could\u0027ve written the letters.\"\\n\\n \"My grandfather?\"\\n\\n \"No. Well, yes, actually, now that you mention it. He had a crush on her, by his own admission. He took all those photographs of her.\"\\n\\n Ford simply dropped his head in his hands. \"It\u0027s a terrible, terrible series of images you\u0027re putting in my brain.\"\\n\\n \"Would he tell you if you asked?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, and I\u0027m not going to ask. Not in any lifetime. And I\u0027m moving out of the crazy section of the veranda.\"\\n\\n \"Wait, wait. We\u0027ll switch grandfathers. Brian\u0027s. It\u0027s hard to see yours holding so fondly on to all those photos if their affair ended so badly. But Brian\u0027s was the type, wasn\u0027t he? Powerful, important. Married. Married with a family, a successful-and public-career. He could\u0027ve written those letters.\"\\n\\n \"Seeing as he\u0027s been dead for about a quarter century, it\u0027d be hard to prove either way.\"\\n\\n It was an obstacle, she thought, but didn\u0027t have to be insurmountable. \"There are probably samples of his handwriting somewhere.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" Ford let out a sigh. \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"If I could get a sample, and compare it to the letters, then I\u0027d know. They\u0027re both gone, and it could end there. There wouldn\u0027t be any point in letting it get out. But...\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d know.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d know, and I could put away that part of her life that I never expected to find.\"\\n\\n \"If they don\u0027t match?\"\\n\\n \"I guess I\u0027ll keep hoping I\u0027ll ask the right question of the right person one day.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see what I can do.\"\\n\\n IT TOOK FORD a couple of days to figure out an approach. He couldn\u0027t lie. Not that he was incapable of it; he was just so freaking bad at it. The only way he\u0027d ever gotten away with a lie had been when the person being lied to felt pity for him and let it slide. He\u0027d learned to sink or swim in the truth.\\n\\n He watched Brian and Shanna turning a load of peat moss into the soil behind the completed stone wall.\\n\\n \"You could get a shovel,\" Brian told him.\\n\\n \"I could, but there is also value in the watching and admiring. Especially in the watching and admiring of Shanna\u0027s ass.\"\\n\\n She wiggled it obligingly.\\n\\n \"We all know you\u0027re watching my ass,\" Brian shot back.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s true. Shanna is only the beard. To be more convincing, maybe she could bend over just a little more and... I\u0027m sold,\" he said when she did so and laughed.\\n\\n It came, Ford supposed, from being friends all their lives. Only one more reason a lie wasn\u0027t an option. But stalling was.\\n\\n \"What are y\u0027all putting up there?\"\\n\\n Brian straightened, swiped a forearm over his sweaty forehead, then pointed to a group of shrubs in nursery pots. \"Make yourself useful, since you don\u0027t seem to have anything better to do. Haul them up here so we can start setting them, see how they look.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s just bitchy because I\u0027m taking ten days off. Going out to L.A. to visit Steve.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah?\" Ford hefted an azalea. \"So...?\"\\n\\n \"\u0027The future has not been written.\u0027\"\\n\\n You had to love a woman who quoted from The Terminator. \"Tell him hey, and all that.\"\\n\\n He waited while they arranged the plants he handed up, rearranged them, argued about the arrangement, and eventually jumped down to study and critique the arrangement.\\n\\n \"Okay, you\u0027re right,\" Shanna admitted. \"We\u0027ll switch that rhodo and that andromeda.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m always right.\" Smugly, Brian poked himself in the chest with his thumb. \"That\u0027s why I\u0027m the boss.\"\\n\\n \"As boss, can you take a minute?\" Ford asked. \"There\u0027s this thing.\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" Brian replied as they walked away.\\n\\n \"Okay, this has to stay between you and me,\" Ford began. \"Cilla found some letters written by a guy her grandmother had an affair with.\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n \"Big, secret affair, married guy, went sour right before she died.\"\\n\\n \"I repeat: So?\"\\n\\n \"Well, they weren\u0027t signed, and Janet kept them and hid them away, so they became Mysterious Letters. In fact, we thought maybe, until Hennessy melted down, that the break-ins were an attempt by the mystery man to get the letters back.\"\\n\\n \"Wouldn\u0027t he be, like, a hundred years old?\"\\n\\n \"Maybe, but not necessarily. And plenty of guys in their seventies once banged women not their wives.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s shocking,\" Brian said drily. \"Hey, maybe it was Hennessy, and he had this wild fling with the beautiful, sexy movie star. Except I think he was born a dried-up asshole.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not beyond the realm. But, ah, a little closer into the circle of logical possibility... See, she knew your grandfather, and he was an important man around here, and came to her parties.\"\\n\\n Ford stood, scratching his head while Brian bent over double and laughed. \"Jesus. Jesus!\" Brian managed. \"The late, great Andrew Morrow doing the nasty with Janet Hardy?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s close to the circle of logical possibility,\" Ford insisted.\\n\\n \"Not in my world, Saw. I don\u0027t remember him all that well, but I remember he was a hard-ass, and self-righteous.\"\\n\\n \"In my world, the self-righteous are often the ones sneaking around getting blow jobs before they go home to the wives and kiddies.\"\\n\\n Brian sobered, considered. \"Yeah, you got a point. And God knows my grandmother must\u0027ve been hard to live with. Water was never quite wet enough for her. God, she ragged on my mom all the damn time. Right up till she died. It\u0027d be kind of cool,\" he decided, \"if Big Drew Morrow had a few rounds with Janet Hardy.\"\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t lying not to mention the claims of pregnancy, and the ugly tenor of the last letters. It was just... not mentioning. \"Do you have anything he wrote? Birthday card, letter, anything?\"\\n\\n \"No. My mother would, I guess. She keeps family papers and that kind of stuff.\"\\n\\n \"Can you get a sample of his handwriting without letting her know what it\u0027s for?\"\\n\\n \"Probably. She\u0027s got a box of my stuff out in the garage. School papers, cards, that kind of shit. There might be something in there. She\u0027s been after me to take it to my place for years. I could get it out of her way, take a look through.\"\\n\\n \"Cool. Thanks.\"\\n\\n \"Hey!\" Shanna shouted over. \"Are you guys about finished or do I have to plant this whole terrace myself?\"\\n\\n \"Nag, nag,\" Brian shouted back.\\n\\n Ford studied her. Built, bawdy, beautiful. \"How come you never went there?\"\\n\\n \"Window of opportunity passed, and she became my sister.\" He shrugged. \"But we\u0027ve got a deal. If we\u0027re both single when we hit forty, we\u0027re going to Jamaica for a week and spend the whole time engaged in mad, jungle sex.\"\\n\\n \"Well. Good luck with that.\"\\n\\n \"Only nine years to go,\" Brian called out as he strode back toward Shanna.\\n\\n For a moment, Ford was simply struck dumb. Nine years? Was that it? He didn\u0027t think about being forty. Forty was another decade. The grown-up decade.\\n\\n How did it get to be only nine years off?\\n\\n Jamming his hands in his pockets, he veered toward the house to find Cilla.\\n\\n In the kitchen, where even the slices and chunks of counter had been torn out and hauled away, and odd-looking pipes poked out of a floor that might have been snacked on by drunken rodents, Buddy worked at a wide slice in the plaster wall.\\n\\n He turned with some sort of large tool in his hand that made Ford think of a metal parrot head mated with a giraffe\u0027s neck.\\n\\n \"Who the hell puts a goddamn faucet over the goddamn stove?\" Buddy demanded.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Ah, in case of fire?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a load of crap.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the best I\u0027ve got. Is Cilla around?\"\\n\\n \"Woman\u0027s always around. Check up in the attic. Toilets in the attic,\" Buddy muttered as he went back to work. \"Faucets over the stove. Want a tub in the bedroom next.\"\\n\\n \"Actually, I\u0027ve seen... Nothing,\" Ford said when Buddy turned slitted eyes on him. \"I see nothing.\"\\n\\n He trooped his way through the house, noted that the trim was nearly finished in the hall, the entryway. On the second floor, he poked into rooms. He could still smell the paint in a room with walls of a subtle, smoky brown. In the master, he studied the three colors brushed on the wall. Apparently, she hadn\u0027t yet decided between a silvery gray, a gray-blue and a muted gold.\\n\\n He wandered down the hall, then up the widened, finished stairs. She stood with Matt, each holding a sample of wood up to the light streaming through the window.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I like the contrast of the oak against the walnut.\" Matt nodded. \"You know what we could do? We could trim it out in the walnut. You\u0027ve got your... Hey, Ford.\"\\n\\n \"Hey.\"\\n\\n \"Summit meeting,\" Cilla told him. \"Built-ins.\"\\n\\n \"Go right ahead.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, like this.\" With his pencil, Matt began to draw on the drywall, and Ford\u0027s attention shifted to the swaths of paint brushed on the opposite wall. She had the same silvery gray here, and a warm cheery yellow competing with what he\u0027d call apricot.\\n\\n He took a look in the bathroom, at the tiles and tones.\\n\\n He tuned back in to hear Matt and Cilla come to an agreement on material and design.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get started on this in my shop,\" Matt told her.\\n\\n \"How\u0027s Josie feeling?\"\\n\\n \"Hot and impatient, and wondering why the hell she didn\u0027t do the math last winter and realize she\u0027d be going through the summer pregnant.\"\\n\\n \"Flowers,\" Ford suggested. \"Buy her flowers on the way home. She\u0027ll still be hot, but she\u0027ll be happy.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I\u0027ll do that. I\u0027ll check, make sure the flooring\u0027s coming in on Tuesday. Barring another screwup, we\u0027ll start hammering it out up here. Roses always work, right?\" he asked Ford.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re a classic for a reason.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. I\u0027ll let you know about the flooring, Cilla.\"\\n\\n As Matt went down, Ford stepped over, tapped Cilla\u0027s chin up, kissed her. \"The pale silver up here, the dull gold in the master.\"\\n\\n She cocked her head. \"Maybe. Why?\"\\n\\n \"Streams better with the bathrooms than your other choices. And while they\u0027re both warm tones, the gray gives a sense of coolness. It\u0027s an attic, however jazzed up you make it. And in the bedroom, that color\u0027s restful but still strong. Now tell me why Buddy\u0027s putting a faucet over your stove.\"\\n\\n \"To fill pots.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. I talked to Brian.\"\\n\\n \"You often do.\"\\n\\n \"About the letters. His grandfather.\"\\n\\n \"You... you told him?\" Her mouth dropped open. \"You just told him I think his grandfather might have broken commandments with my grandmother?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think commandments were mentioned. You wanted a handwriting sample. Brian can probably get one.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but... Couldn\u0027t you have been covert, a little sneaky? Couldn\u0027t you have lied?\"\\n\\n \"I suck at sneak. And even if I gold-medaled in the sneak competition, I can\u0027t lie to a friend. He understands I told him in confidence, and he won\u0027t break a confidence to a friend.\"\\n\\n She blew out a breath. \"You people certainly grew up on a different planet than I did. Are you sure he won\u0027t say anything to his father? It\u0027s a stew pot of embarrassment.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure. He did have an interesting comment though. What if Hennessy wrote the letters?\"\\n\\n Cilla went back to gape. \"Kill-you-with-my-truck Hennessy?\"\\n\\n \"Well, think about it. How crazy would you get if you\u0027d been having an affair with a woman, then the son of that woman is responsible-in your eyes-for putting your son in a wheelchair? It\u0027s way-fetched, I agree.

So she comes to Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley to save the dilapidated farmhouse that once belonged to her grandmother—a legendary actress who died of an overdose more than thirty years ago. \\n Plunging into the project with gusto, Cilla’s almost too busy and exhausted to notice her neighbor, graphic novelist Ford Sawyer. Determined not to carry on the family tradition of ill-fated romances, Cilla steels herself against Ford’s quirky charm, though she can’t help indulging in a little fantasy. \\n But it’s reality that holds its share of dangers for Cilla. A cache of unsigned letters found in the attic points to a mysterious romance in her grandmother’s life—and may be the catalyst for a frightening, violent assault. And if Cilla and Ford are unable to sort out who is targeting her and why, she may, like her world-famous grandmother, be cut down in the prime of her life.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/tribute.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/tribute.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:03 AM"}}
