{"id":75449,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"She didn\u0027t think about the vandalism. Or when thoughts of what waited for her across the road crept into her mind, Cilla firmly slammed the door. No point in it, she told herself. There was nothing she could do because she didn\u0027t know what she wanted to do.\\n\\n There was no harm in a day out of time. A fantasy day, really, filled with sex and sleep inside the bubble of rain-slicked windows. She couldn\u0027t remember the last time she\u0027d been content to spend the day in a man\u0027s company, unless it had been work-related.\\n\\n Even the idea of wine and video games held an appeal. Until Ford severely trounced her for the third time in a row.\\n\\n \"She-what\u0027s her name?-Halle Berry.\"\\n\\n \"Storm,\" Ford provided. \"Halle Berry\u0027s the actress, and really hot. Storm is a key member of the X-Men. Also really hot.\"\\n\\n \"Well, she just stood there.\" Cilla scowled down at the controls. \"How am I supposed to know what to push and what to toggle, and whatever?\"\\n\\n \"Practice. And like I said, you need to form your team more strategically. You formed your all-girl alliance. You should\u0027ve mixed it up.\"\\n\\n \"My strategy was gender solidarity.\" Under the coffee table, Spock snorted. \"That\u0027s enough out of you,\" she muttered. \"Besides, I think this controller\u0027s defective because I have excellent hand-eye coordination.\"\\n\\n \"Want to switch and go another round?\"\\n\\n She eyed him narrowly. \"How often do you play this?\"\\n\\n \"Off and on. Throughout my entire life,\" he added with a grin. \"I\u0027m currently undefeated on this version of Ultimate Alliance.\"\\n\\n \"Geek.\"\\n\\n \"Loser.\"\\n\\n She handed him her controller. \"Put your toys away.\"\\n\\n Look at that, she thought when he rose to do just that. Tidy hot guy. Tidy straight hot guy. How many of them were there in the world?\\n\\n \"Saving the world worked up my appetite. How about you?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t save the world,\" she pointed out.\\n\\n \"You tried.\"\\n\\n \"That was smug. I see the smug all over you.\"\\n\\n \"Then I\u0027d better wash up. I got leftover spaghetti and meatballs, courtesy of Penny Sawyer.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got a nice setup here, Ford. Work you love, and a great house to do it in. Your ridiculously appealing dog. The tight circle of friends going back to childhood. Family you get along with, close enough you can cop leftovers. It\u0027s a great platform.\"\\n\\n \"No complaints. Cilla-\"\\n\\n \"No, not yet.\" She could see in his eyes the offer of sympathy and support. \"I\u0027m not ready to think about it yet. Spaghetti and meatballs sounds like just the thing.\"\\n\\n \"Cold or warmed up?\"\\n\\n \"It has to be exceptional spaghetti and meatballs to warrant cold.\"\\n\\n He crossed back, took her hand. \"Come with me,\" he said and led her around to the kitchen. \"Have a seat.\" He took the bowl out of the fridge, peeled off the lid, got a fork. \"You\u0027ll get yours,\" he told Spock as the dog danced and gurgled. Turning back, he set the bowl on the bar, then wound some pasta on a fork. \"Sample.\"\\n\\n She opened her mouth, let him feed her. \"Oh. Okay, that\u0027s really good. Really. Give me the fork.\"\\n\\n With a laugh, he passed it to her. After adding some to Spock\u0027s dish, he topped off both glasses of wine. They sat at the counter, eating cold pasta straight from the bowl.\\n\\n \"We had this cook when I was a kid. Annamaria from Sicily. I swear her pasta wasn\u0027t as good as this. What?\" she said when he shook his head.\\n\\n \"Just strikes me weird that I know somebody who can say, \u0027We had a cook when I was a kid.\u0027\"\\n\\n She grinned around more pasta. \"We had a butler.\"\\n\\n \"Get out.\"\\n\\n She raised her brows, inclined her head and stabbed at a meatball. \"Two maids, chauffeur, gardener, under-gardener, my mother\u0027s personal assistant, pool boy. And once, when my mother discovered the pool boy, whom she was banging, was also banging one of the maids, she fired them both. With much drama. She had to go to Palm Springs for a week to recover, where she met Number Three-ironically, by the pool. I\u0027m pretty sure, at some point, he also banged the pool boy. The new pool boy, whose name was Raoul.\"\\n\\n He gestured at her with his fork until he swallowed. \"You grew up in an eighties soap opera.\"\\n\\n She thought it over. \"Close enough. But, in any case, Annamaria had nothing on your mother.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027ll get a kick out of hearing that. What was it like, seriously? Growing up with maids and butlers?\"\\n\\n \"Crowded. And not all it\u0027s cracked up to be. That sounds snotty,\" she decided. \"And I imagine some woman with a house and family to run, a full-time job and the need to get dinner on the table would be tempted to bitch-slap me for it. But.\" She shrugged. \"There\u0027s always somebody there, so genuine privacy is an illusion. No sneaking a cookie out of the jar before dinnertime. Actually no cookies for the most part as the camera adds pounds. If you have a fight with your mother, the entire household knows the details. More, the odds are that those details will be recounted sometime down the road in a tabloid interview or a disgruntled former employee\u0027s tell-all book.\\n\\n \"All in all,\" she concluded, \"I\u0027d rather eat leftover spaghetti.\"\\n\\n \"But, if I remember right, you don\u0027t cook.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, that\u0027s a problem.\" She reached for her wine. \"I\u0027ve thought about maybe asking Patty for pointers in that area. I like to chop.\" She hacked down a few times with the flat of her hand to demonstrate. \"You know, vegetables, salads. I\u0027m a hell of a chopper.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a start.\"\\n\\n \"Self-sufficiency, that\u0027s the key. You manage.\"\\n\\n \"True, but I\u0027ve been butler-free all my life. I do have a biweekly cleaning service, and am well acquainted with the primary and alternate routes to all takeout facilities. Plus, I have a direct line to Brian and Matt and Shanna, who will handle small household emergencies for beer.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a system.\"\\n\\n \"Well oiled.\" He tucked her hair behind her ear.\\n\\n \"If and when I learn to cook something other than a grilled cheese sandwich and canned soup, I\u0027ll have reached another lofty personal goal.\"\\n\\n \"What are some of the others?\"\\n\\n \"Lofty personal goals? Rehabbing a house and selling it at a profit. I hit that one. Having my own business and having said business generate an actual income. Which first requires reaching the goal of getting my contractor\u0027s license, which in turn requires passing the test for same. In a couple weeks, actually, if I-\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got to take a test? I love tests.\" His eyes actually lit up. \"Do you need a study buddy? And yes, I capitalize the N in nerd.\"\\n\\n She paused with what she swore would be her last bite of pasta halfway to her mouth. \"You love tests?\"\\n\\n \"Well, yeah. There are questions and answers. True or false, multiple choice, essay. What\u0027s not to love? I kill on tests. It\u0027s a gift. Do you want any help?\"\\n\\n \"Actually, I think I\u0027m good. I\u0027ve been prepping for it for a while now. I think I met your kind during my brief and unfortunate college experience. You\u0027re the one who screwed the curve for me, every time. You are, therefore, one of the primary reasons I\u0027m a one-semester college dropout.\"\\n\\n \"You should\u0027ve asked my kind to be your study buddy. Besides, you should thank my kind for putting you exactly where you want to be right now.\"\\n\\n \"Hmm.\" She deliberately nudged the bowl toward him and away from herself. \"That\u0027s very slick and clever. Previous humiliation and failure lead to current spaghetti-and-meatball-induced contentment.\"\\n\\n \"Or, condensing, sometimes shit happens for the best.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a bumper sticker. I have to move.\" She pressed a hand on her stomach, slid off the stool. \"And I\u0027ll demonstrate my self-sufficiency and gratitude for current contentment by doing the dishes, which includes everything back to breakfast, apparently.\"\\n\\n \"We were busy with other things.\"\\n\\n \"I guess we were.\"\\n\\n For a moment, he indulged himself with wine and watching her. But watching wasn\u0027t enough. He stood and crossed to her, turned her to face him. She had a wooden spoon in her hand and an easy smile curving her lips. He wrapped her hair around his hand-and saw her eyes widen in surprise, heard the spoon clatter to the floor-as he used it like a rope to tug her head back.\\n\\n And ravished her mouth.\\n\\n A new and rampant hunger surged through him, a whip of need and now. He released her hair to drag off her shirt. Even as his mouth crushed back down to hers, he yanked her pants down her hips.\\n\\n It was a tornado of demand and speed. It seemed she was naked before she could catch the first breath. Plucked up off the ground while her head spun and her heart lurched. He dropped her down on the counter, shoved her legs apart.\\n\\n And ravished her.\\n\\n Her hand flailed out for purchase. Something shattered; she wondered if it was her mind. His fingers dug into her hips as he pounded into her, pounded greed and scorching pleasure. Mad for more, she locked her legs around his waist.\\n\\n His blood pounded under his skin, a thousand brutal drumbeats. The hunger that had leaped into him seemed to snap its teeth and bite even as he drove himself into her to slake it. Its dark excitement pushed him to take, to fill her with the same wild desperation that burned in him.\\n\\n When it broke, it was like shooting out of the black, into the blind.\\n\\n Her head dropped limply onto his shoulder while her breath came in short, raw gasps. She felt him tremble, found herself pleased she wasn\u0027t the only one.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" she managed, \"God.\"\\n\\n \"Give me a minute. I\u0027ll help you down.\"\\n\\n \"Take your time. I\u0027m fine where I am. Where am I?\"\\n\\n His laugh muffled against the side of her neck. \"Maybe it was something in the spaghetti sauce.\"\\n\\n \"Then we need the recipe.\"\\n\\n Steadier, he leaned back, took a good look at her.\"Now I really want my camera. You\u0027re the first naked woman to sit on my kitchen counter, which I now plan to have sealed in Lucite. I\u0027d like to document the moment.\"\\n\\n \"Not a chance. My contract specifies no nude scenes.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a damn shame.\" He stroked her hair back. \"I guess the least I can do after playing Viking and maiden is help you with the dishes.\"\\n\\n \"The least. Hand me my shirt, will you?\"\\n\\n \"See, I\u0027ve confiscated your clothes. You\u0027ll have to do the dishes naked.\"\\n\\n Her head cocked, her eyebrows lifted. On a sigh, Ford scooped up her shirt. \"It was worth a shot.\"\\n\\n HE WOKE in the dark to a quiet house and an empty bed. Groggy and baffled, he rose to look for her. One part of his brain reserved the right to be pissed if she\u0027d gone back across the road without waking him.\\n\\n He found his front door open, and saw the silhouette of her sitting in one of the chairs on his veranda with Spock stretched at her feet. He smelled coffee as he pushed open the screen.\\n\\n She glanced over. \"Morning.\"\\n\\n \"As long as it\u0027s still dark, it\u0027s not morning.\" He sat beside her. \"Give me a hit of that.\"\\n\\n \"You should go back to bed.\"\\n\\n \"Are you going to give me a hit of that coffee or make me go get my own?\"\\n\\n She passed him the cup. \"I have to decide what to do.\"\\n\\n \"At...\" He took her wrist, turned it up and squinted at her watch. \"Five-oh-six in the morning?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t deal with it yesterday, didn\u0027t think about it. Or not much. I even left my phone over there so the police couldn\u0027t contact me. So no one could. I ducked and covered.\"\\n\\n \"You took a break. There\u0027s no reason you can\u0027t take a couple more days before you try to figure it all out.\"\\n\\n \"Actually, there are real and practical reasons I can\u0027t take more time. I have subs coming in about two hours, unless I call them off. If I take them off for a couple of days, it\u0027s more than screwing up my schedule, which is, of course, already screwed. It messes up theirs, and their employees\u0027. And subs are always juggling jobs, so I could lose key people for more than a couple of days if I hold them off. If that decision is to walk away, I have to tell them that.\"\\n\\n \"The circumstances aren\u0027t of your making, and no one\u0027s going to blame you.\"\\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t think anyone would. But it still creates a domino effect. I also have to consider my budget, which is also screwed. I have insurance, but insurance has a deductible that has to be factored into the whole. I\u0027m already over the high end of my projections, but that was my choice, with the changes and additions I made.\"\\n\\n \"If you need-\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t,\" she said, anticipating him. \"I\u0027m okay financially, and if I can\u0027t make it on my own, I can\u0027t make it. If I really needed extra, I could make a few calls, grab a couple voice-over jobs. Bottom line is I can\u0027t leave the place the way it is, half done. I\u0027ve got custom cabinets I ordered back in March, and the balance due when I take delivery. The kitchen appliances will be back in another couple months. Other details, small and large. It has to be finished, that\u0027s not really a question. The questions are do I want to finish it, and do I want to stay? Can I? Should I?\"\\n\\n He took another hit of her coffee. Serious conversations, he thought, required serious attention. \"Tell me what you\u0027d do if you decided to turn it over to someone else to finish. If you left.\"\\n\\n \"There are a lot of places I could slip into without the baggage I have here. Stick a pin in a map, I guess, and pick one. Take some of those voice-overs to thicken the bankroll, if I need to. Find a place with potential to flip. I can get a mortgage. Regular and very nice residuals from Our Family look good on an application. Or if I don\u0027t want the stress of that, I could get a job with a crew. Hell, I could work for Steve\u0027s new New York branch.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d be giving up your lofty personal goals.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe I\u0027d just postpone reaching them. The problem is...\" She paused, sipped the coffee he\u0027d handed back to her. \"The problem is,\" she repeated, \"I love that house. I love what it was, what I know I can make it. I love this place, and how I feel here. I love what I see when I look out my windows or step out my door. And I\u0027m pissed off that someone\u0027s meanness makes me consider giving that up.\"\\n\\n Something that had tightened inside him relaxed. \"I like it better when you\u0027re pissed off.\"\\n\\n \"I do, too, but it\u0027s hard to hold up the level. The part of me that isn\u0027t pissed off or discouraged is scared.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s because you\u0027re not stupid. Someone\u0027s set out to deliberately hurt you. You\u0027re going to be scared, Cilla, until you know who and why, and make it stop.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know where to start.\"\\n\\n \"Do you still think it\u0027s old man Hennessy?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s the only one I\u0027ve met or had contact with around here who\u0027s made it clear he hates me. Which, if this were a screenplay, means he couldn\u0027t be behind all this because he\u0027s the only one who hates me. But-\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll go talk to him, face-to-face.\"\\n\\n \"And say what?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll come to us, but basically you\u0027re sticking, you\u0027re making your home here, and neither you nor a house is responsible for something that happened over thirty years ago. And words to that effect. I\u0027m also going to make copies of those letters you found. I\u0027m going to read them more carefully and so are you. You need to think about passing them to the cops. Because if it\u0027s not Hennessy, the next best possibility is it\u0027s someone connected to those letters who got wind they still exist and you have them. Janet Hardy\u0027s married secret lover revealed? That\u0027d be news. Big, juicy, scandalous news.\"\\n\\n She\u0027d thought of that. Of course she\u0027d thought of that. But... \"They aren\u0027t signed.\"\\n\\n \"Might be clues in there about the identity. Might not be, but we\u0027re talking thirty-five years ago. Do you remember everything you wrote thirty-five years ago?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m twenty-eight, but I get what you\u0027re saying.\" In the still, softening dark, she stared at him. \"You\u0027ve given this a lot of thought.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. The first, the prowler in your barn. That could\u0027ve been somebody hoping to pick up a few Janet Hardy souvenirs. I\u0027ve got to weigh in the place has been empty for years now, and sure I\u0027ve seen some people poking around now and then. Against that, I\u0027ve got to factor most people didn\u0027t know there was anything left inside, and any who did probably thought it was worthless junk left by tenants, not the woman herself. But then you come along.\"\\n\\n \"I clear it out, store it in the barn, and it\u0027s clear and obvious that I\u0027m sorting through it, culling out anything that belonged to my grandmother. \"\\n\\n \"Somebody gets curious, a little greedy. Possibility. The second, the attack on Steve, could come from the same root. Poking around, somebody\u0027s coming. Panic. But that takes it way over harmless if annoying trespass. Also above, if the letters are the goal, trespass to preserve reputation. It\u0027s up to assault, arguably attempted murder.\"\\n\\n She shivered. \"Of discouraged, pissed and scared, scared just leaped way into the lead.\"\\n\\n \"Good, because then you\u0027ll be more careful. Next, your truck door.\\n\\n That one\u0027s personal and direct to you. So was the message on the stone wall. Maybe there are two separate people involved.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, that really helps. Two people who hate me.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s another possible. Last, the destruction inside the house. It\u0027s more personal, more direct, and it\u0027s ballsier. So today, you\u0027re going shopping for a security system.\"\\n\\n \"Is that what I\u0027m going to do?\"\\n\\n The cold bite in her tone didn\u0027t break his skin. \"One of us is. Since it\u0027s your place, I assume you\u0027d rather do it yourself. But if you don\u0027t, today, I will. I\u0027m now authorized as I\u0027ve had you naked on my kitchen counter. No point in whining to me if you didn\u0027t bother to read the fine print.\"\\n\\n She said nothing for a moment, struggling against the urge to stew. \"I intended to arrange that anyway-stay or go.\"\\n\\n \"Good. And you don\u0027t care for ultimatums. Neither do I, but in this particular case, I\u0027m making an exception. I can sleep over there with you. Happy to. But sleep is a foregone conclusion at some point, just as the house being empty at some time or other for some period of time is inevitable. You need to be safe, and to feel safe. You need to protect your property.\\n\\n \"And Cilla, there\u0027s no \u0027go.\u0027 You\u0027ve already decided to stay.\"\\n\\n She really did want to stew, she thought, and he was making it damn hard to indulge. \"How come you\u0027re all macho and pushy with your ultimatum, but you\u0027re not all macho and pushy telling me to flee to safety while you slay the dragon?\"\\n\\n \"My shining armor\u0027s in the shop. And maybe I just like the sex, which would be hard to come by with all the fleeing. Or it could be I don\u0027t want to see you give up something you love.\"\\n\\n Yeah, he made it damn hard. \"When I came out here to sit, I told myself it was just a house. I\u0027ve put a lot of myself into other houses-it\u0027s what makes the rehab worthwhile-and I\u0027ve let them go. It\u0027s just a house, wood and glass and pipes and wire, on a piece of ground.\"\\n\\n She looked down when he laid his hand over hers, when the gesture told her he understood. \"Of course it\u0027s not just a house, not to me. I don\u0027t want to let it go, Ford. I\u0027d never get it back, never get back what I\u0027ve found if I let it go.\"\\n\\n She turned her hand over, laced her fingers with his. \"Plus, I like the sex.\"\\n\\n \"It can\u0027t be overstated.\"\\n\\n \"Okay then.\" She took a deep breath. \"I\u0027ve got to get back. Get ready. Get started.\"\\n\\n \"Let me get some shoes on. I\u0027ll walk you home.\"\\n\\n MATT STOOD in the center of the master bath, hands on his hips, face grim. \"I\u0027m awful damn sorry about this, Cilla. I don\u0027t know what gets into people, I swear I don\u0027t. We\u0027re going to fix that wall for you, don\u0027t worry. And Stan\u0027ll come back and do the tile. I can get one of my men to chip out what\u0027s damaged in place, but it\u0027d be better to leave the glass block for Stan. I\u0027ll give him a call for you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d appreciate that. I need to go pick up the replacement tile and block, some supplies. Arrange for a security system.\"\\n\\n \"I hear that. People didn\u0027t lock their doors half the time around here when I was a kid. Times change. Another damn shame when it comes to things like this. You said they busted out a pane in the back door? I\u0027ll get somebody to replace that for you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to order a new door, and a lock set for that and the front. The plywood\u0027s okay for now. You\u0027ll need to take down that drywall rather than try to repair it. There\u0027s enough on site.\"\\n\\n \"Sure there is. Anything else I can do, Cilla, you just let me know. Got the other bathroom up here, too?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Got it good.\"\\n\\n \"I guess we\u0027d better take a look.\"\\n\\n They assessed damage, talked repairs. As she gathered her lists and checked on other areas of the project, crew offered sympathy, asked questions, expressed outrage and disgust. By the time she left, her ears were ringing from it, and with the more comforting sound of whirling drills and buzzing saws.\\n\\n INEVITABLY, SHE HAD to explain to her usual consultant at the flooring center why she needed to buy considerable square footage of tile she\u0027d already bought, as well as grout. It slowed the process, but Cilla supposed that, too, was inevitable. Even in L.A. she\u0027d formed relationships with specific tile guys, lumber guys, appliance guys. It went with the trade, and good relationships paid off the time spent.\\n\\n She ran into the same situation at the home supply store when she stopped in to buy the replacement sink and other items on her list. While she waited for the clerk to check stock, she cruised the faucets. Chrome, nickel, brass, copper. Brushed, satin, antiqued. Single handles, vessel style. Matching towel bars, robe hooks.\\n\\n All the shapes, the textures, the tones, gave her the same rush of pleasure others might find browsing the glittery offerings in Tiffany\u0027s.\\n\\n Copper. Maybe she\u0027d go with copper on her office bath. With a stone vessel-style sink and-\\n\\n \"Cilla?\"\\n\\n She broke off from her visualization to see Tom Morrow and Buddy coming down the aisle. \"I thought that was you,\" Tom said. \"Buying or deciding?\"\\n\\n \"Both, actually.\"\\n\\n \"Same for me. I\u0027m outfitting a spec out. Usually my bath and kitchen designer takes care of this, but she\u0027s out on maternity leave. Plus, I like to get my hand in occasionally. You know how it is.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I do.\"\\n\\n \"Got my consultant here,\" he said with a wink. \"Buddy\u0027ll make sure I don\u0027t go buying a center set when I need a wide, or vice versa.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve done it before,\" Buddy pointed out.\\n\\n \"And you never let me forget. I heard you ladies had a fine time on Saturday.\"\\n\\n \"We did.\"\\n\\n \"Cathy always says shopping\u0027s her hobby. I\u0027ve got golf, she\u0027s got the mall and the outlets.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t see the point in either.\" Buddy shook his head. \"Fishing\u0027s got a point.\"\\n\\n \"Excuse me.\" The clerk strode up. \"Everything\u0027s in stock, Ms. McGowan. You got the last we have of the wall-hung sink.\"\\n\\n \"What wall-hung?\" Buddy wanted to know. \"I\u0027m plumbing for a pedestal in the third bath.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a replacement. The sink you installed in the second-floor guest bath was damaged.\"\\n\\n If he\u0027d been a rooster, Cilla thought, Buddy\u0027s cockscomb would have quivered.\\n\\n \"How the hell did that happen? Nothing wrong with it when I put it in.\"\\n\\n Okay, Cilla thought, one more time. \"I had a break-in Saturday. Some vandalism.\"\\n\\n \"My God! Were you hurt?\" Tom demanded.\\n\\n \"No, I wasn\u0027t home. I was out with your wife and Patty and Angie.\"\\n\\n \"They busted up a sink?\" Buddy pulled off his cap to scratch his head. \"What the hell for?\"\\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t say. But both second-floor baths we\u0027d finished took a hit. They used my sledge and pickax from the look of it, smashed a lot of tile, one of the walls, the sink, some glass block.\"\\n\\n \"This is terrible. It\u0027s not the sort of thing that happens around here. The police-\"\\n\\n \"Are doing what they can,\" she said to Tom. \"So they tell me, anyway.\" Since she wanted the word spread, she kept going. \"I\u0027ll be installing a security system.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t blame you. I\u0027m so sorry to hear this, Cilla.\"\\n\\n \"Wouldn\u0027t want my daughter living out that far on her own.\" Buddy shrugged. \"Just saying. Especially after what happened to Steve.\"\\n\\n \"Bad things happen everywhere. I\u0027ve got to get my supplies and finish my run. Good luck with the spec.\"\\n\\n \"Cilla, if there\u0027s anything we can do, Cathy or I, you just give a call. We\u0027re a growing area, but that doesn\u0027t mean we don\u0027t take care of our own.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n It warmed her, and stayed warm inside her, even as her supplies were loaded, even as she drove away.\\n\\n Our own. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tribute/page-17.html","bookId":2414,"book":{"id":2414,"title":"Tribute","description":"Storyline: Cilla McGowan, a former child star, has found a more satisfying life restoring homes. So she comes to Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley to save the dilapidated farmhouse that once belonged to her grandmother—a legendary actress who died of an overdose more than thirty years ago. \\n Plunging into the project with gusto, Cilla’s almost too busy and exhausted to notice her neighbor, graphic novelist Ford Sawyer. Determined not to carry on the family tradition of ill-fated romances, Cilla steels herself against Ford’s quirky charm, though she can’t help indulging in a little fantasy. \\n But it’s reality that holds its share of dangers for Cilla. A cache of unsigned letters found in the attic points to a mysterious romance in her grandmother’s life—and may be the catalyst for a frightening, violent assault. And if Cilla and Ford are unable to sort out who is targeting her and why, she may, like her world-famous grandmother, be cut down in the prime of her life.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/tribute.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/tribute.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:03 AM"}}
