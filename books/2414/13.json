{"id":75445,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Ford watched Cilla take digitals of the pickup\u0027s door. His rage wanted to bubble up, but he couldn\u0027t figure out what he\u0027d do with it if he spewed.\n Kick the tires? Punch a couple of trees? Stalk around and froth at the mouth? None of the options seemed particularly helpful or satisfying. Instead he stood with his hands jammed in his pockets, and the rage at a low, simmering boil.\n \"The cops\u0027ll take pictures,\" he pointed out.\n \"I want my own. Besides, I don\u0027t think Wilson and Urick are going to make this a priority.\"\n \"It could be connected. They\u0027ll be here in the morning.\"\n She shrugged, then turned the camera off, stuck it in her pocket. \"That\u0027s not coming off. The sun baked that marker on so it might as well be paint. I\u0027ll have to have the whole damn door done. I haven\u0027t had this truck three months.\"\n While he watched, she kicked a tire. He decided he\u0027d been right. She didn\u0027t look satisfied. \"You can use my car until it\u0027s fixed.\"\n \"I\u0027ll drive this.\" Both the defiance and the temper glared out of her eyes. \"I know I\u0027m not a whore. I saw Hennessy\u0027s van in the parking lot before I went in to visit Steve. He could\u0027ve done this. He could\u0027ve hurt Steve. He\u0027s capable.\"\n \"Did Steve say anything about it?\"\n \"We didn\u0027t ask him. He was still so weak and disoriented. Probably tomorrow, the doctor said. He\u0027d be up to talking to the police tomorrow. Damn it!\"\n She stalked for a few minutes but, he noted, didn\u0027t froth at the mouth or punch a tree. Then she stopped, heaved out a breath. \"Okay. Okay. I\u0027m not going to let some asshole spoil this really excellent day. Does the liquor store in town have any champagne in stock?\"\n \"Couldn\u0027t say. But I do.\"\n \"How come you have everything?\"\n \"I was a Boy Scout. Seriously,\" he said when she laughed. \"I have the merit badges to prove it.\" She was right, he decided, no asshole should be allowed to spoil an excellent day. \"How about we heat up a frozen pizza and pop the cork?\"\n From his perch on the veranda, Spock leaped up and danced.\n \"Sounds good to me, too.\"As she moved in to kiss him, a horn beeped cheerfully.\n \"Well,\" Ford said when a Mustang convertible in fire-engine red pulled in behind Cilla\u0027s car, and Spock tore down the steps to spin in delirious circles, \"it had to happen sometime.\"\n The vivid color of the car had nothing on the windswept red mop of the woman who waved from the passenger seat, who tipped down her big, Jackie O sunglasses to peer at Cilla over the top as she stepped out onto peep-toe wedges to greet the bouncing, spinning dog.\n The driver unfolded himself. It was the height and the build that alerted Cilla, even before she got a good look at the shape of the jaw.\n Her palms automatically went damp. This was definitely meet-the-parents. An audition she invariably failed.\n \"Hello, my cutie-pie!\" Penny Sawyer clamped her hands on Ford\u0027s cheeks once he\u0027d walked down the slope to her. She kissed him noisily. Her laugh was like gravel soaked in whiskey.\n \"Hey, Mama. Daddy.\" He got a one-armed bear hug from the man with hair of Cary Grant silver. \"What are y\u0027all doing?\"\n \"Heading out to Susie and Bill\u0027s. Texas Hold \u0027 Em tournament.\" Penny poked Ford in the chest while Ford\u0027s father squatted to shake hands with Spock. \"We had to drive right by, so we stopped in case you wanted in.\"\n \"I always lose at poker.\"\n \"You don\u0027t have gambling blood.\" Penny turned her avid eyes on Cilla. \"But you do have company. You don\u0027t have to tell me who this is. You look just like your grandmama.\" Penny moved forward, hands outstretched. \"The most beautiful woman I ever saw.\"\n \"Thank you.\" Left with no choice, Cilla wiped her hands hurriedly on her pants before taking Penny\u0027s. \"It\u0027s nice to meet you.\"\n \"Cilla McGowan, my parents, Penny and Rod Sawyer.\"\n \"I know your daddy very well.\" Penny shot a sly glance at her husband.\n \"Now you cut that out,\" Rod told her. \"Always trying to make me jealous. Heard a lot of good things about you,\" he said to Cilla.\n \"Heard hardly a syllable out of this one.\" Penny poked Ford again.\n \"I am the soul of discretion.\"\n Penny let out her quick, rumbling laugh again, then dug into her purse. She pulled out an enormous Milk Bone that sent Spock into a medley of happy growls, grunts and groans while his body quivered and his bulging eyes shone.\n \"Be a man,\" she said to the dog, and Spock rose up on his hind legs to dance in place. \"That\u0027s my sweetheart,\" she crooned and held the biscuit out. Spock nipped it and, with a full-body wag, ran off to chomp and chew. \"I have to spoil him,\" she said to Cilla. \"He\u0027s the closest thing resembling a grandchild I\u0027ve gotten out of this one.\"\n \"You have two of the human variety from Alice,\" Ford reminded her.\n \"And they get cookies when they visit.\" She gestured to the house across the road. \"It\u0027s a good thing you\u0027re doing, bringing that place back to life. It deserves it. Your grandfather\u0027s going to be at the game tonight, Ford. My daddy was madly in love with your grandmother.\"\n Cilla blinked. \"Is that so?\"\n \"Head over. He has scores of pictures she let him take over the years. He wouldn\u0027t sell them for any price, even when I had a notion to frame a few and display them at the bookstore.\"\n \"Mama owns Book Ends in the Village,\" Ford told Cilla.\n \"Really? I\u0027ve been there. I bought some landscaping and design books from you. It\u0027s a nice store.\"\n \"Our little hole in the wall,\" Penny said. \"Oh now, look, we\u0027re going to be late. Why do you let me talk so much, Rod?\"\n \"I have no idea.\" \"Y\u0027all change your mind about the game, we\u0027ll make sure you get a seat at a table. Cilla, they\u0027d just love to have you, too,\" Penny called out as Rod pulled her down to the car. \"I\u0027m going to have Daddy bring those pictures over for you to look at.\"\n \"Thank you. Nice to meet you.\"\n \"Ford! You bring Cilla over for dinner sometime.\"\n \"In the car, Penny.\"\n \"I\u0027m getting, I\u0027m getting. You hear?\"\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" Ford called back. \"Win a bundle.\"\n \"I\u0027m feeling lucky!\" Penny shouted as Rod zipped into reverse, then zoomed on down the road.\n Cilla said, \"Wow.\"\n \"I know. It\u0027s like being lightly brushed by the edge of a hurricane. Leaves you a little surprised and dazed, and sure that much more and you\u0027d be flat on your ass.\"\n \"You look a lot like your father, who is very handsome, by the way. But your mother? She\u0027s dazzling.\"\n \"She is, as her own father likes to say, a corker.\"\n \"Corker.\" Cilla laughed as they walked into the house. With a polite burp, Spock trotted in with them. \"Well, I like her, and I tend to eye mothers suspiciously. Speaking of corks. Where\u0027s the champagne?\"\n \"Spare fridge, mudroom.\"\n \"I\u0027ll get that, you get the pizza.\"\n Moments later, she came back into the kitchen with a bottle of Veuve Clicquot and a puzzled frown. \"Ford, what are you doing with all that paint?\"\n \"The what?\" He looked over from setting the oven. \"Oh that. There\u0027s a zillion gallons of primer, a zillion of exterior red, and a slightly lesser amount of exterior white, for trim.\"\n As her heart did a slow somersault, she set the bottle on the counter. \"You bought the barn paint.\"\n \"I don\u0027t believe in jinxes. I do believe in positive thinking, which is just really hope anyway.\"\n Everything inside her shifted, settled. Opened. She stepped to him, laid a hand on his cheek, laid her lips on his. Warm as velvet, tender as a wish, the kiss flowed. Even when he shifted so she pressed back against the counter, it stayed slow and silky, deep and dreamy.\n When their lips parted, she sighed, then rested her cheek against his in a gesture of simple affection she gave to very few. \"Ford.\" She drew back, sighed again. \"My head\u0027s too full of Steve to meet your requirements for sex tonight.\"\n \"Ah. Well.\" He trailed a fingertip up her arm. \"Realistically, they\u0027re more loose guidelines than strict requirements.\"\n She laughed, caressed his cheek once more. \"They\u0027re good requirements. I\u0027d like to stick to them.\"\n \"Got no one to blame but myself.\" He stepped around her to slide the pizza into the oven.\n \"So we\u0027ll eat bad pizza, get a little buzzed on champagne and not have sex.\"\n Ford shook his head as he removed the foil and the cage on the bottle. \"Almost my favorite thing to do with a beautiful woman.\"\n \"I don\u0027t fall for guys. It\u0027s a policy,\" she said when he paused and glanced over at her. \"Considering the influence of inherited traits-and the track record of my grandmother and mother in that area-I\u0027ve taken a pass. Steve was an exception, and that just showed how it can go. So I don\u0027t fall for guys. But I seem to be falling for you.\"\n The cork exploded out of the bottle as he stared at her. \"Does that scare you?\"\n \"No.\" He cleared his throat. \"A little. A moderate amount.\"\n \"I thought it might because it\u0027s got me jumpy. So I figured heads-up.\"\n \"I appreciate it. Do you have, like, a definition for the term \u0027fall for\u0027?\" God, she thought as she looked at him. Oh my God, she was a goner. \"Why don\u0027t you get the glasses? I think we could both use a drink.\"\n SHE HIRED PAINTERS, and had some of the crew haul the paint to the barn. She talked to the cops, and made a deal with a local body shop to paint the door of her truck. Whenever she caught sight of the white van, she had no qualms about shooting up her middle finger.\n No evidence, the cops said. Nothing to place Hennessy at the scene on the night Steve was attacked. No way to prove he decorated her truck with hate.\n So she\u0027d wait him out, Cilla decided. And if he made another move, she\u0027d be ready.\n Meanwhile, Steve had been bumped down to a regular room, and his mother had hopped back on her broomstick to head west.\n Dripping sweat from working in the attic, Cilla stood studying the skeleton of the master bath. \"It\u0027s looking good, Buddy. It\u0027s looking good for tomorrow\u0027s inspection.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know why in God\u0027s world anybody needs all these shower-heads. \"\n \"Body jets. It\u0027s not just a shower, it\u0027s an experience. Did you see the fixtures? They came in this morning.\"\n \"I saw. They\u0027re good-looking,\" he said, grudgingly enough to make her smile.\n \"How are you coming with Mister Steam?\"\n \"I\u0027ll get it, I\u0027ll get it. Don\u0027t breathe down my neck.\"\n She made faces at his back. \"Well, speaking of showers, I need one before I go in to see Steve.\"\n \"Water\u0027s turned off. You want this done, water\u0027s got to stay off.\"\n \"Right. Shit. I\u0027ll grab one over at Ford\u0027s.\"\n She didn\u0027t miss the smirk he shot her, but opted to ignore it. She grabbed clean clothes, stuffed them in her purse. Downstairs, she had a few words with Dobby, answered a hail from the kitchen area, then spent another ten minutes outside discussing foundation plantings.\n She dashed across the road before someone could catch her again, and decided to slip into the shower off the gym rather than disturb Ford.\n It wasn\u0027t until she was clean, dry and wrapped in a big white towel that she realized she\u0027d left her purse-and the clothes in it-sitting on her front veranda.\n \"Oh, crap.\"\n She looked down at the sweaty, grungy clothes she\u0027d stripped off and dragged a hand through her clean hair. \"No, I am not crawling back into them.\"\n She\u0027d have to disturb Ford after all. Bundling her underwear and baggy work shorts in her T-shirt, she tied it off and carried the bundle with her.\n She opened the door to the kitchen, to a very surprised Ford.\n \"Oh, hi. Listen-\"\n \"Ford, you didn\u0027t tell us you had company.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t know I did. Hey, Cilla.\"\n Her expression went from slightly harried to mildly ill as she looked over and saw Ford\u0027s mother sitting at the kitchen bar with an older man.\n While she stood frozen, Spock dashed over to rub against her bare legs. \"Oh God. Oh God. Just... God. I\u0027m sorry. Excuse me.\"\n Ford grabbed her arm. \"Back up like that, you\u0027ll pitch right down the steps. You\u0027ve met my mother. This is my grandfather, Charlie Quint.\"\n \"Oh, well, hello. I apologize. I\u0027m, well, what can I say? Ford, I didn\u0027t want to interrupt you. I thought you\u0027d be working. They had to turn the water off at my place for a while, so I ran over to use your shower downstairs-thanks for that. And then realized that when I was being distracted by varieties of spirea, I left my bag and my clothes sitting on the veranda. I came up to ask if you wouldn\u0027t mind running over there and, you know, getting them. My clothes.\"\n \"Sure.\" He sniffed at her. \"My soap smells better on you than on me.\"\n \"Hah.\"\n \"Cilla, I bet you\u0027d like a nice glass of iced tea.\" Penny rose to get a glass.\n \"Oh, don\u0027t bother, I-\"\n \"No bother. Ford, go on now, get this girl her clothes.\"\n \"All right. But it\u0027s kind of a shame. Isn\u0027t it, Granddad?\"\n \"Pretty legs on a pretty woman are easy on the eyes. Even old eyes. You look more like her in person than you do in pictures I\u0027ve seen of you.\"\n How much more awkward could it be? Cilla wondered when Ford winked and slipped out. \"You knew my grandmother.\"\n \"I did. I fell in love with her the first time I saw her on the movie screen. She was just a little girl, and I was just a boy, and that was the sweetest kind of puppy love. You never forget your first.\"\n \"No, I guess you don\u0027t.\"\n \"Here you go, honey. Why don\u0027t you sit down?\"\n \"I\u0027m fine. Thanks.\" She stared at the glass Penny offered and wondered how to take it as she had one hand holding the bundle of filthy clothes, and the other clutched on the towel.\n \"Oh, are those your dirty clothes? Just give those to me. I\u0027ll toss them in Ford\u0027s machine for you.\"\n \"Oh, no, don\u0027t-\"\n \"It\u0027s no trouble.\" Penny pulled them away, pushed the cold glass into Cilla\u0027s hand. \"Daddy, why don\u0027t you show Cilla the pictures? We were going to drop by to do just that,\" Penny continued from the mudroom. \"Just stopped to say hi to Ford first. My goodness! You must\u0027ve worked up a storm today.\"\n Casting her eyes to the ceiling, Cilla moved closer to the counter as Charlie opened the photo album.\n \"These are wonderful!\"\n At the first look, she forgot she was wearing only a towel and edged closer. \"I haven\u0027t seen these before.\"\n \"My personal collection,\" he told her with a wistful smile. \"This one here?\" He tapped a finger under a picture. \"That\u0027s the first one I ever took of her.\"\n Janet sat on the steps of the veranda, leaning back, relaxed and smiling in rolled-up dungarees and a plaid shirt.\n \"She looks so happy. At home.\"\n \"She\u0027d been working with the gardeners-walking around with them, showing them where she wanted her roses and such. She got word I took pictures and asked if I\u0027d come over, take some of the house and grounds as things were going on. And she let me take some of her. Here she is with the kids. That\u0027d be your mother.\"\n \"Yes.\" Looking bright and happy, Cilla thought, alongside her doomed brother. \"They\u0027re all so beautiful, aren\u0027t they? It almost hurts the eyes.\"\n \"She shone. Yes, she did.\"\n Cilla paged through. Janet, looking golden and glorious astride a palomino, tumbling on the ground with her children, laughing and kicking her feet in the pond. Janet alone, Janet with others. At parties at the farm. With the famous, and the everyday.\n \"You never sold any of these?\"\n \"That\u0027s just money.\" Charlie shrugged. \"If I sold them, they wouldn\u0027t be mine anymore. I gave her copies of ones she wanted, especially.\"\n \"I think I might have seen a couple of these. My mother has boxes and boxes of photos. I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ve seen all of them. The camera loved her. Oh, this! It\u0027s my favorite so far.\"\n Janet leaned in the open doorway of the farmhouse, head cocked, arms folded. She wore simple dark trousers and a white shirt. Her feet were bare, her hair loose. Flowers spilled out of pots on the veranda, and a puppy curled sleeping at the top of the steps.\n \"She bought the puppy from the Clintons.\" Penny stepped beside her father, rested a hand on his shoulder. \"Your stepmama\u0027s people.\"\n \"Yes, she told me.\"\n \"Janet loved that dog,\" Charlie murmured.\n \"You need to make copies for Cilla, Daddy. Family pictures are important.\"\n \"I guess I could.\"\n \"Granddad\u0027s going to make copies for Cilla,\" Penny announced as Ford walked in with Cilla\u0027s bag. \"He has the negatives.\"\n \"I could scan them. If you\u0027d trust me with them. Here you go.\" Ford passed the bag to Cilla.\n \"Thanks.\" Sensing Charlie\u0027s hesitation, Cilla eased back. \"They\u0027re wonderful photographs. I\u0027d love to look through the rest, but I have to get to the hospital. I\u0027m just going to...\" She held up the bag. \"Downstairs.\"\n \"You look more like her than your mother,\" Charlie said when Cilla reached the door. \"It\u0027s in the eyes.\"\n And in his lived such sadness. Cilla said nothing, only slipped quickly downstairs.\n CILLA DID a mental happy dance as the first tiles were laid in the new master bath. She glugged down water and executed imaginary high kicks through the first run of subway tiles in what would be her most fabulous steam shower.\n The black-and-white design, retro cool Deco, added just the right zing. Stan, the tile guy, glanced over his shoulder. \"Cilla, you gotta get the AC up.\"\n \"We\u0027re working on it. By the end of the week, I promise.\"\n It had to be running by week\u0027s end, she thought. Just as the bed she\u0027d ordered had to be delivered. Steve couldn\u0027t recuperate in a steamy house, in a sleeping bag.\n She went back to framing in the closet in the master bedroom. In a couple of weeks, she thought, if everything stayed on schedule, she\u0027d have two completed baths, the third, fourth and the powder room on the way. She\u0027d be ready for Sheetrock up in her attic office suite, the replastering should be about wrapped. Then Dobby could start work on the ceiling medallions. Well, he could start once she\u0027d settled on a design.\n She ran through projections while she checked her level, adjusted, shot in nails.\n And in a few weeks, she\u0027d take the contractor\u0027s exam. But she didn\u0027t want to think about it. Didn\u0027t want to think if she didn\u0027t make it, she\u0027d have to ask one of her own subs for a job by the end of the year. If she didn\u0027t make it, she couldn\u0027t afford to buy that sweet little property down the road in the Village that she knew would make an excellent and profitable flip.\n If she didn\u0027t make it, it would be another failure. She really thought she was at her quota already.\n Positive thinking, she reminded herself. That\u0027s what Ford would say. No harm in trying.\n \"Gonna make it,\" she stated aloud and stepped back from the framing with a nod of approval. \"Gonna kick exam ass. Cilla McGowan, Licensed Contractor.\"\n Gathering her tools, she started out to check on the progress of her exterior office stairs with a quick peek at the tile work on the way. She joined the carpenter crew as the painters, working on her new scaffolding, added the first strokes of red to the barn.\n The air smelled of the mulch freshly laid around new plantings, and salvaged ones. Roses, hydrangeas, spirea and old-fashioned weigela, and beds of hopeful new perennials, eager annuals already blooming insanely.\n More to come, she thought, more to do. But here was progress. Tear-out time was done. Renewal time was here.\n She thought of Charlie\u0027s photo album. And breaking off from the work, ran in to get her camera to document.\n Shirtless men slick with sweat and sunscreen high on scaffolding. Shanna in shorts and a bright pink T-shirt and ball cap working with Brian on a low, dry stone garden wall. The bones of her stairs, the half-finished back veranda. And around front, the completed one.\n For a moment, in her mind\u0027s eye, she saw Janet, leaning on the jamb of the open front door, smiling out.\n \"It\u0027s coming back,\" Cilla said softly.\n Turning, she saw Ford and Spock walking down the drive.\n The dog trotted up to her, leaned on her legs, then sat back to look up at her, all love and cheer. She rubbed, petted, kissed his nose.\n \"Brought you a present.\" Ford handed her one of the two Cokes he carried. \"I swung in to see Steve. He tells me they\u0027re going to spring him in a couple days.\"\n \"He\u0027s coming back strong.\" Like the farm, she thought. \"I\u0027m pushing to get the AC up, and I\u0027ve got a bed coming.\"\n \"You want him to recoup from having his skull fractured in a construction zone. Do you hear that?\" Ford asked, tapping his ear.\n Cilla shrugged off the buzzing, the banging, the whirl of drills. \"To people like me and Steve, that\u0027s chamber music.\"\n \"I\u0027ll have to take your word for it. But he could bunk at my place. I\u0027ve got the bed, the AC. And digital cable.\"\n She took a long drink, watching him. \"You really mean that.\"\n \"Damn right. I pity anyone without digital cable.\"\n \"I bet. But you\u0027re not going to take on my ex-husband. He\u0027ll need to be... Who\u0027s this?\" she wondered as a black Lexus turned cautiously into her drive.\n \"City car,\" Ford commented. \"Big city.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know who... Crap.\"\n Ford lifted his brows as men exited from both sides of the car. \"Friends of yours?\"\n \"No. But the driver\u0027s my mother\u0027s Number Five.\"\n \"Cilla!\" Mario, handsome as sin, Italian style, in Prada loafers and Armani jeans, threw out his arms and a wide, wide smile. His graceful forward motion was spoiled when he stopped, then sidestepped around the sniffing Spock.\n The sunglasses hid his eyes, but she suspected they were dark and sparkling. Tanned, panther lean, dark hair flowing, he crossed to her, caught her in an enthusiastic embrace and kissed her cheeks. \"Look at you! So fit, so competent.\"\n \"I am. What are you doing here, Mario?\"\n \"A little surprise. Cilla, this is Ken Corbert, one of our producers. Ken, Cilla McGowan, my stepdaughter.\"\n \"It\u0027s a real pleasure.\" Ken, small and wiry, silver-winged black hair, pumped Cilla\u0027s hand. \"Big fan. So...\" He scanned the farm. \"This is the place.\"\n \"It\u0027s my place,\" she said coolly. \"Ford, Mario and Ken. I\u0027m sorry, I can\u0027t ask you in. We\u0027re a work in progress.\"\n \"So I see.\" Mario\u0027s smile never dimmed. \"And hear.\"\n \"Spock, say hello,\" Ford ordered-after his dog had finished with the tires. \"He wants to shake,\" Ford explained, \"to make sure you\u0027re friendly.\"\n \"Ah.\" Mario studied the dog dubiously as he put the tips of his thumb and forefinger on the offered paw.\n Spock didn\u0027t appear to be impressed.\n Ken gave Spock\u0027s paw the same salesman pump he\u0027d given Cilla\u0027s.\n \"Lovely country,\" Mario continued. \"Just lovely. We drove down from New York. We had some meetings. Such scenery! Your mother sends her love,\" he added. \"She would have come, but you know how difficult it is for her. The memories here.\"\n \"She\u0027s in New York?\"\n \"A quick trip. We barely have time to catch our breath. Fittings, rehearsals, meetings, media. But Ken and I must steal you away, a late lunch, an early drink. Where can we take you?\"\n \"Nowhere, but thanks. I\u0027m working.\"\n \"Didn\u0027t I tell you?\" Mario let out a hearty laugh while Spock squatted on his haunches and stared at him with suspicious eyes. \"Cilla is the most amazing woman. So many talents. You can spare an hour, cara.\"\n \"I really can\u0027t. Especially if this is about performing in Mom\u0027s show. I told her I wasn\u0027t interested.\"\n \"We\u0027re here to persuade you that you are. Perhaps you\u0027d excuse us,\" Mario said to Ford.\n \"No, he won\u0027t.\" Cilla pointed at Ford. \"You won\u0027t.\"\n \"I guess I won\u0027t.\"\n Irritation tightened Mario\u0027s mouth briefly. The grumbling growl from Spock had him eyeing the dog with some trepidation. \"You have a chance to make history, Cilla. Three generations performing together. You saw Celine perform with Elvis? We have that technology. We can bring Janet onstage with you and Bedelia. One extraordinary performance, live.\"\n \"Mario-\"\n \"I understand you\u0027re reluctant to commit to doing the full set of duets with your mother, though I can tell you-as will Ken-what that would mean to the show, and to you. Your career.\"\n \"The advertising and promotion we\u0027ve got lined up,\" Ken began. \"We can all but guarantee sellouts in every venue. Then the cable special, the CD, the DVD. The foreign markets are already buzzing. We may be able to work a deal to attach a second CD, a special package, for you, solo. In fact, Mario and I were kicking around ideas for videos there. And you\u0027re right, Mario, shooting here would add punch.\"\n \"You\u0027ve been busy, haven\u0027t you?\" Cilla\u0027s voice was as soft, and as meaningful, as Spock\u0027s growl. \"And you\u0027ve been wasting your time. No. I\u0027m sorry, Ken, I don\u0027t believe Mario made it clear. I\u0027m not looking to be persuaded or revived or promoted. You have no business talking to producers, promoters, advertisers about me,\" she said to Mario. \"You\u0027re not my agent or my manager. I don\u0027t have an agent or a manager. I run the show now. And this is what I do. Houses. I do houses. Enjoy the scenery on the way back.\"\n She knew Mario would come after her. Even as she turned on her heel to stride away, she heard him call her name. And she heard Ford speak to Ken, caught the extra yokel he put in his voice.\n \"Spock, stay. So y\u0027all drove down from New York City?\"\n \"Cilla. Cara. Let me-\"\n \"Touch me, Mario, and I swear I\u0027ll deck you.\"\n \"Why are you angry?\" There was puzzled sorrow in his voice. \"This is an insanely rich opportunity. I\u0027m only looking out for your interests.\"\n She stopped, struggled with temper ripe to bursting. \"You may actually believe that on some level. I can look after my own interests, and have been for a long time.\"\n \"Darling, you were mismanaged. Otherwise you\u0027d be a major star today.\"\n \"I might be a major star today if I\u0027d had the talent and the aptitude. Listen to what I\u0027m saying to you: I don\u0027t want to be a major star. I don\u0027t want to perform. I don\u0027t want that kind of work. I don\u0027t want that kind of life. I\u0027m happy here, Mario, if that matters to you. I\u0027m happy with what I have, and I\u0027m getting happy with who I am.\"\n \"Cilla, your mother needs you.\"\n \"And here it comes.\" She turned away in disgust.\n \"She has her heart set. And the backers will do so much more with this addition. She\u0027s so-\"\n \"I can\u0027t do it, Mario. And I won\u0027t. I\u0027m not just being a hard-ass. I can\u0027t. It\u0027s not in me. You should have talked to me before you came here, and brought him. And you should listen to me when I say no. I\u0027m not Dilly. I don\u0027t bullshit, I don\u0027t play. And she\u0027s already used up all her guilt points with me. I\u0027m not doing this for her.\"\n His face, his voice, held nothing but sadness now. \"You\u0027re very hard, Cilla.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n \"She\u0027s your mother.\"\n \"That\u0027s right. Which makes me, let\u0027s see. Her daughter. Maybe, this time-this one time-she could think about what I need, about what I want.\" She held up a hand. \"Believe me, if you say anything else, you\u0027ll only make it worse. Cut your losses here. You\u0027re smart enough. Tell her I said knock them dead, break a leg. And I mean it. But that\u0027s all I\u0027ve got.\"\n He shook his head as a man might over a sulking child. He walked away in his excellent shoes, and got into the big city car with Ken to drive away.\n Ford wandered over, stared off at the barn while Spock rubbed himself against Cilla\u0027s legs. \"That red\u0027s going to look good.\"\n \"Yeah. You\u0027re not going to ask what that was about?\"\n \"I got the gist. They want, you don\u0027t. They pushed, you didn\u0027t budge. They pissed you off, which is fine. But in the end it made you sad. And that\u0027s not. So I don\u0027t care about them or what they want. I say fuck \u0027em, and that red looks good going on that barn.\"\n It made her smile. \"You\u0027re good to have around, Ford.\" She leaned down, ruffled Spock. \"Both of you. Back in L.A., I\u0027d have paid several hundred dollars for this kind of therapy.\"\n \"We\u0027ll bill you. Meanwhile, why don\u0027t you show me what\u0027s going on around here today?\"\n \"Let\u0027s go bug the tile guy. It\u0027s my favorite so far.\" She took Ford\u0027s hand and walked into the house. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tribute/page-13.html","bookId":2414,"book":{"id":2414,"title":"Tribute","description":"Storyline: \n Cilla McGowan, a former child star, has found a more satisfying life restoring homes. So she comes to Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley to save the dilapidated farmhouse that once belonged to her grandmother—a legendary actress who died of an overdose more than thirty years ago. \n Plunging into the project with gusto, Cilla’s almost too busy and exhausted to notice her neighbor, graphic novelist Ford Sawyer. Determined not to carry on the family tradition of ill-fated romances, Cilla steels herself against Ford’s quirky charm, though she can’t help indulging in a little fantasy. \n But it’s reality that holds its share of dangers for Cilla. A cache of unsigned letters found in the attic points to a mysterious romance in her grandmother’s life—and may be the catalyst for a frightening, violent assault. And if Cilla and Ford are unable to sort out who is targeting her and why, she may, like her world-famous grandmother, be cut down in the prime of her life.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/tribute.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/tribute.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:03 AM"}}
