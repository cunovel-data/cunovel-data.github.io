{"id":75454,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"Ford knew he had a strong imagination. He considered himself to be a man of some vision. As far as Cilla\u0027s \"little Cape Cod\" went, he couldn\u0027t imagine how anyone could define it, however loosely, as a house, and could only visualize it being mercifully razed.\n Stains of a suspicious and undoubtedly unpleasant nature stamped and streaked the carpet in the pint-sized living room. He could only be grateful he\u0027d let Spock play job dog again, otherwise Spock would\u0027ve been honor bound to re-mark all the previously marked areas.\n Either an animal or an army of rodents had gnawed on the baseboard. The ceiling, also unpleasantly stained in one corner, was bumpy with what Cilla called popcorn.\n The kitchen was a truly ugly hodgepodge of mismatched appliances, torn linoleum and a rusted sink. The stingy counters carried the round burn marks of pans carelessly set on blue-speckled white Formica. Grime, and God knew what else, lived in the corners.\n In his mind\u0027s eye he imagined cockroaches flooding out of that rusted sink, armed with automatic weapons, driving tanks and armored vehicles to wage war against spiders in combat gear firing bazookas.\n He found it easy to let Cilla do the talking. He was speechless.\n The second floor consisted of two bedrooms scattered with the debris of former tenants and a bathroom he wouldn\u0027t have entered while wearing a hazmat suit.\n \"As you can see, there\u0027s work to be done!\" Vicky showed white, white teeth in what could only be a pained, somewhat desperate smile. \"But with some elbow grease and sweat equity, it could be a little dollhouse! Such a cute starter home for a young couple like yourselves.\"\n \"A couple of what?\" Ford said and got the fish eye from Cilla.\n \"Vicky, would you mind if we just looked around on our own for a few minutes? Talked about it?\"\n \"Of course not! Take all the time you want. I\u0027ll just step outside and make some calls. Don\u0027t rush on my account!\"\n \"Why does she say everything in exclamation points?\" Ford asked when Vicky was out of earshot. \"Is it fear? Excitement? Does she have multiple, spontaneous orgasms?\"\n \"Cute.\"\n \"Cilla, I think that pile of what may have once been clothing in that corner just moved. There may be a body in there. Possibly an army of cockroaches waiting to ambush. We should leave. And never come back.\"\n \"If there was a body, it would smell a lot worse than it does in here.\"\n \"How much worse?\" he muttered. \"And have you ever actually smelled a body?\"\n She gave him the fish eye again. \"Cockroaches may be a factor, however. If the seller had any brains, he\u0027d have cleaned this place out, ripped up this incredibly smelly carpet. But his loss could be our gain.\"\n \"You\u0027ve got to be kidding. The only thing we could gain from this place is a rampant case of typhoid. Or bubonic plague.\" He kept a wary eye on the pile of rags. He wasn\u0027t entirely sure it hadn\u0027t moved. \"Cilla, this place has no possible redeeming value.\"\n \"Because you don\u0027t know where to look. Deal was, you don\u0027t want to risk it, you don\u0027t. But let me give you the idea first. There\u0027s hardwood under this carpet. I checked when I went through before.\"\n She walked over, crouched to pull up a loose corner. \"Random-length oak, and in surprisingly good shape.\"\n \"Okay, it\u0027s got a floor.\"\n \"And a good foundation, a nice-sized lot.\"\n \"That looks like a minefield. Probably booby-trapped by the atomic spiders.\"\n \"New sod,\" she continued, undaunted, \"some plantings, a pretty little deck on the back. Gut the bathroom.\"\n \"Wouldn\u0027t it be more humane to bomb it?\"\n \"New tub, new sink, a nice ceramic tile. For a room that size, I could probably find enough of a discontinued style, neutral color. All the carpet goes. Replace the closet doors, add shelves. Redo the ceilings, paint. You\u0027ve got a couple of nice kids\u0027 rooms.\"\n \"And where would the parents sleep?\" He slid his hands into his pockets rather than risk accidentally touching something. \"In a hotel if they have any sense.\"\n She crooked her finger. \"This wall moves out fifteen feet.\"\n \"It does?\"\n \"It will and, running the width of the house, will hold the master suite, overlooking the backyard. Walk-in closet, attached bath with soaking tub and separate shower. Double sinks, granite countertop. Maybe slate tile. Have to price that out.\"\n \"What holds it up? Hopes and dreams?\"\n \"The new kitchen/great room.\"\n \"Oh, that.\" But oddly enough, he began to see it as she did. Or as he thought she did.\n \"Horrible carpet treads out, oak treads in,\" she said as she started down the steps. \"Replace skinny banister. Carpet goes, ceilings redone, new trim, some crown molding. New windows throughout. Gut kitchen.\"\n \"Thank the Lord.\"\n \"Half bath and laundry room here. Kitchen, dining area and family room, open floor plan, breakfast bar for the casual, family meal, all leading out through atrium doors to the nice little deck. Exterior paint in a cheerful color, replace the cracked concrete walkway with pavers, plug in some plants, a little dogwood tree. And that\u0027s about it.\"\n \"Oh, well, that\u0027s hardly anything.\"\n She laughed. \"It\u0027s a lot, but it\u0027ll be a lot. Poor, sad thing. Sixteen weeks. It could be done in twelve, but not with juggling, so I\u0027d say sixteen. With the top offer I\u0027d make and materials and labor, mortgage payments for, we\u0027ll say, five months, and the market value after improvements in this neighborhood, you could see between forty and forty-five K in profit.\"\n \"Seriously?\"\n \"Oh yeah. Depending on the market when it\u0027s done, that could be closer to sixty thousand. The neighborhood\u0027s on an upswing.\" She began ticking items off on her fingers. \"Younger couples, small families moving in, prettying things up. It\u0027s in a good school district, only about ten minutes from a shopping center. Master suites, kitchens and baths- that\u0027s where the sales are made and you get your biggest return on your investment.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n \"No, you have to be sure. Take a little time to think about it. I\u0027ll draw up some floor plans.\"\n \"No, I\u0027m sold. Let\u0027s go make Vicky\u0027s day.\" And get the hell out while the cockroaches and spiders have their moratorium.\n \"Wait, wait. We need to let her suffer more. You\u0027re going to steal this place, Ford.\" He found the sly delight on her face infectious. \"It deserves to be stolen because the seller couldn\u0027t even be bothered to make an attempt. We\u0027re going to tell her, very unconvincingly, that we\u0027ll think about it. Then we\u0027re going to walk away. In a week, ten days, I\u0027ll call her back.\"\n \"If somebody buys it in the meantime?\"\n \"When it\u0027s been sitting here for over four months, even with two price reductions? I don\u0027t think so. We\u0027re going to go give Vicky the disappointment she\u0027s expecting. Then I want to go home, soak in your hot tub and relax.\"\n RELAXING PROVED PROBLEMATIC because of the half-dozen reporters camped at her wall.\n \"Not much interest, you said?\"\n \"This is nothing.\" And hardly more than she\u0027d expected. \"Just a spillover from the statement. They\u0027ll mostly be local, or out of D.C., maybe. We\u0027re close enough for that. You go inside. I\u0027ll handle it.\"\n \"You\u0027re going to give them interviews?\"\n \"Not exactly. A few crumbs. They\u0027ll take the crumbs and fly away. There\u0027s no reason for you to be involved in this. And you\u0027ll just give them another angle.\"\n But the minute they stepped out of the car, cameras lifted. Like one entity, reporters surged across the road, shouting Cilla\u0027s name, calling out questions. As it struck Ford as a kind of attack, he moved instinctively to Cilla\u0027s side.\n \"Georgia Vassar, WMWA-TV. Can you tell us your thoughts on the altercation yesterday with James Robert Hennessy?\"\n \"How serious are your injuries?\"\n \"Is it true Hennessy believes you\u0027re the reincarnation of Janet Hardy?\"\n \"I\u0027ve already issued a statement about the incident,\" Cilla said coolly. \"I don\u0027t have any more to say.\"\n \"Isn\u0027t it true that Hennessy threatened you previously? And, in fact, assaulted Steve Chensky, your ex-husband, while Chensky lived with you? Was that assault the reason for your failed reconciliation?\"\n \"To my knowledge, Mr. Hennessy hasn\u0027t been charged with the assault on Steve, who was visiting me for a short time this spring. We\u0027ve been friends before, during and after our marriage. There was no reconciliation. \"\n \"Is that due to your relationship with Ford Sawyer? Mr. Sawyer, how do you feel about the attack on Ms. McGowan?\"\n \"There\u0027s speculation that you and Steve fought over Cilla, and he was injured. How do you answer that?\"\n \"No comment. Gosh, you guys seem to be on my property. We\u0027re pretty friendly around here, but you\u0027re going to want to step off.\"\n \"I won\u0027t be as friendly if any of you trespass on mine,\" Cilla warned.\n \"Is it true that you came here in an attempt to commune with the spirit of your grandmother?\" someone shouted as she turned with Ford toward the house.\n \"Tabloid crap,\" Cilla stated. \"I\u0027m sorry. Most of that was tabloid crap.\"\n \"No problem.\" Ford shut the door behind them, locked it. \"I\u0027ve always wanted the opportunity to say \u0027No comment\u0027 in a stern voice.\"\n \"They\u0027ll give up. It won\u0027t play more than a day or two, and most of that\u0027ll be in the supermarket sheets alongside stories of alien babies being homeschooled in Utah.\"\n \"I knew it!\" He shot a finger in the air. \"I knew that was the reason for Utah. How about a glass of wine with that soak, while I figure out how to get my dog back?\"\n \"Not a good idea. The wine, yeah, and Spock, but you\u0027ve got a lot of glass in your gym.\" She offered an apologetic look, the best she could give him. \"Glass, telephoto lenses. No point in handing it to them. They\u0027ve got your name. You\u0027re going to find yourself alongside the alien babies, too.\"\n \"Finally, a lifelong dream fulfilled.\" He reached for glasses, glanced down at his answering machine. \"Aren\u0027t I the popular guy today? Forty-eight messages.\" Even as he spoke, the phone rang.\n \"You should screen, Ford. I really thought by issuing a short, clear statement I\u0027d head this off. Kim, the publicist, agreed with me. But for whatever reason, some of the media wants to run with it, and turn down cockeyed angles.\"\n \"Let\u0027s do this.\" He lifted the phone, switched off the ringer. \"I\u0027ll do the same with the others. My family, my friends have my cell number if they need to reach me. I\u0027ll call Brian, see if he\u0027ll take Spock home with him tonight. We\u0027ll take some wine, cook up a frozen pizza and camp upstairs in the bedroom behind the curtains. At last, the opportunity to expose you to a marathon running of Battlestar Galactica.\"\n She leaned back on the counter as the tension in her shoulders dissolved. Not angry, she realized. Not upset. Not even especially irked. How had she ever managed to connect with someone so blessedly stable?\n \"You really know how to keep it simple.\"\n \"Unless the Cylons are bent on destroying your entire species, it usually is simple. You get the pizza, I\u0027ll get the wine.\"\n CILLA WOKE at five A.M. to the beep of the internal clock she\u0027d set in the middle of the night after the alarms had sounded at the Little Farm. Something else she should have expected, she thought as she went to shower. There were some members of some media who routinely ignored the law in pursuit of a story. So she\u0027d spent an hour with the police and Ford across the road.\n And she had a lock set on her back door bearing the scratches of a botched jimmy attempt.\n She dressed, left a note for Ford. The radio car remained in her drive, where it had been posted after the attempted break-in. Birds chirped, and she caught sight of a trio of deer at her pond. But no reporters camped outside her walls.\n Maybe she\u0027d gotten lucky, she thought, and that was that. Using Ford\u0027s car, she drove into town. She was back by six-thirty, and carried a box of doughnuts and two large coffees down her drive.\n The cop behind the wheel rolled down his window.\n \"I know it\u0027s a cliche,\" she said, \"but.\"\n \"Hey. That was nice of you, Miss McGowan. It\u0027s been quiet.\"\n \"And a long night for both of you. It looks like the invaders have retired the field. I\u0027m going to start work. Some of the crew will be coming along by seven.\"\n \"It\u0027s a nice spot you\u0027ve got here.\" The second cop pulled a glazed with sprinkles out of the box. \"Heck of a bathroom up there on the second floor. My wife\u0027s been wanting to update ours.\"\n \"If you decide to, give me a call. Free consult.\"\n \"Might do that. We\u0027ll be going off shift pretty soon. Do you want us to call in and request another car?\"\n \"I think we\u0027ll be fine now. Thanks for looking out for me.\"\n Inside, she set up to finish her run of baseboard. By eight, the hive of activity buzzed. Grouting, drywall mudding, consults on driveway pavers and pond work. Turning her attention to the third bedroom, Cilla checked her closet measurements. As she removed the door, Matt stepped in.\n \"Cilla, I think you\u0027d better take a look outside.\"\n \"What? Is there a problem?\"\n \"I guess you need to look, decide that for yourself.\"\n She propped the door against the wall, hustled after him. One look out the front window of the master bedroom had her gasping.\n Six reporters had been a nuisance, and not unexpected. Sixty was a disaster.\n \"They just started showing up, kind of all at once,\" Matt told her. \"Kinda like there was a signal. Brian called me out, said some of them are yelling questions at his crew. Jesus, there\u0027s TV cameras and everything.\"\n \"Okay, okay, I need to think.\" She had at least a dozen crew working between the house and the grounds. A dozen people she couldn\u0027t possibly censor or control.\n \"There shouldn\u0027t be this kind of interest in me being in a wreck, even with the circumstances. A few blips on the entertainment news maybe, reports locally. I need to make a call. Matt, if you could try to keep the men from talking to them, at least for now. I need a few minutes to...\" She trailed off as the gleaming black limo streamed through her entrance.\n \"Man, look at that.\"\n \"Yes, look at that,\" Cilla echoed. She didn\u0027t have to see Mario climb out of the back to know who\u0027d arrived. Or why.\n By the time Cilla reached the veranda, Bedelia Hardy stood under the supportive protection of her husband\u0027s arm. She tilted her face out at the perfect angle, Cilla thought with burning resentment, so those long lenses could capture her poignant expression. She wore her hair loose so it shone in the sun over the linen jacket the same color as her eyes.\n As Cilla let the screen door slam behind her, Dilly threw open her arms, keeping her body angled for the profile shots. \"Baby!\"\n She came forward in rather spectacular Jimmy Choo sandals with three-inch heels. Trapped, Cilla walked down the steps in her work boots and into the maternal arms and clouds of Soir de Paris. Janet\u0027s signature scent that had become her daughter\u0027s.\n \"My baby, my baby.\"\n \"You did this,\" Cilla whispered in Dilly\u0027s ear. \"You leaked to the press you were coming.\"\n \"Of course I did. All press is good press.\" She leaned back, and through the amber lenses of Dilly\u0027s sunglasses, Cilla saw the calculatedly misted eyes widen in genuine concern. \"Oh, Cilla, your face. You said you weren\u0027t hurt. Oh, Cilla.\"\n It was that, that moment of sincere shock and worry, Cilla supposed, that dulled the sharpest edge of resentment. \"I got some bumps, that\u0027s all.\"\n \"What did the doctor say? Oh, that horrible man, that Hennessy. I remember him. Pinched-faced bastard. My God, Cilla, you\u0027re hurt.\"\n \"I\u0027m fine.\"\n \"Well, why don\u0027t you at least put on some makeup? No time for that now, and it\u0027s probably better this way. Let\u0027s go. I\u0027ve worked it all out. You\u0027ll just follow my lead.\"\n \"You sicced them on me, Mom. You know this is exactly what I didn\u0027t want.\"\n \"It\u0027s not all about you, and what you want.\" Dilly looked past Cilla to the house, then turned away. And again, Cilla saw genuine feeling. Pain. \"It never has been. I need the column inches, the airtime. I need the exposure, and I\u0027m going to take it. What happened, happened. Now you can let them keep pushing on that, on you, or you can help spin some of it, maybe most of it, around to me.\n \"Jesus! What is that?\"\n Cilla glanced down and saw Spock sitting patiently, paw out, big, bulbous eyes latched onto Dilly.\n \"That\u0027s my neighbor\u0027s dog. He wants you to shake.\"\n \"He wants... Does it bite?\"\n \"No. Just shake his paw, Mom. He\u0027s decided you\u0027re friendly because you hugged me.\"\n \"All right.\" She leaned over carefully and, to her credit, in Cilla\u0027s mind, gave Spock\u0027s paw a firm shake. Then smiled a little. \"He\u0027s so ugly, but in a weirdly sweet way. Shoo now.\"\n Dilly turned, her arm firm around Cilla\u0027s waist, and flung out a hand to her husband. \"Mario!\"\n He trotted up, took her hand, kissed it.\n \"We\u0027re ready,\" she told him.\n \"You look beautiful. Only a few minutes this time, darling. You shouldn\u0027t be out in the sun too long.\"\n \"Stay close.\"\n \"Always.\"\n Clutching Cilla, Dilly began to move toward the entrance, toward the cameras.\n \"Great shoes,\" Cilla complimented. \"Poor choice for grass and gravel.\"\n \"I know what- Who\u0027s this? We can\u0027t have reporters breaking ranks.\"\n \"He\u0027s not a reporter.\" Cilla watched Ford shove through the lines. \"Keep going,\" she told him when he reached them. \"You don\u0027t want any part of this.\"\n \"This would be your mother? It\u0027s unexpected to meet you here, Miss Hardy.\"\n \"Where else would I be when my daughter\u0027s been hurt? The new love interest?\" She scoped him head to toe. \"I\u0027ve heard a little about you. Not from you,\" she said with a glance at Cilla. \"We\u0027ll have to talk. But now, just wait with Mario.\"\n \"No. He\u0027s no Mario, and he won\u0027t be hanging back at heel like a trained lapdog. Don\u0027t give them that, Ford.\"\n \"I\u0027m going to go in and get some coffee,\" he decided. \"Want me to call the cops while I\u0027m at it?\"\n \"No. But thanks.\"\n \"Isn\u0027t he all southern-fried and yummy,\" Dilly commented as Ford continued toward the house. \"Your taste\u0027s improved.\"\n \"I\u0027m so angry with you now.\" Indeed, the anger vibrated and pulsed inside her chest. \"Be careful, very careful, what buttons you push.\"\n \"You think this is easy for me, coming to this place? I\u0027m doing what I need to do.\" Dilly lifted her chin, the brave mother, supporting her injured child. Questions hurled out, but Dilly walked through them, a soldier stoically braving the front line.\n \"Please. Please.\" She held up a hand, lifting her voice. \"I understand your interest, and even on some level appreciate it. I know your viewers and your readers care, and that touches me. But you must understand that our family is, once again, going through a difficult time. And this is... painful. My daughter has been through a terrible experience. I\u0027m here for her, as any mother would be.\"\n \"Dilly! Dilly! When did you hear about Cilla\u0027s accident?\"\n \"She called me as soon as she was able. No matter how grown up, a child still wants her mother when she\u0027s hurt. Even though she told me not to come, not to break off rehearsals for my cabaret act, not to expose myself to the grief and the memories this place holds for me, of course I came to her.\"\n \"You haven\u0027t been back, by your own statements, to this house since shortly after Janet Hardy\u0027s suicide. How does it feel, being here now?\"\n \"I can\u0027t think of it. Not yet. My daughter is my only concern. Later, when we\u0027ve had time to be together, in private, I\u0027ll explore those feelings. My mother...\" Her voice cracked, on cue. \"My mother would want me to give my daughter, her granddaughter, all my energies.\"\n \"Cilla, what are your plans? Will you open the house to the public? There\u0027s speculation you hope to house memorabilia here.\"\n \"No. I plan to live here. I am living here,\" she corrected, cold, clear-voiced, while the temper beat and beat. \"The property has been in my family, on both the Hardy and the McGowan sides, for generations. I\u0027m restoring and remodeling it, and it will be, as it\u0027s always been, a private home.\"\n \"Is it true that you\u0027ve been plagued by break-ins, by vandalism during your restoration?\"\n \"There have been incidents. I don\u0027t consider them a plague.\"\n \"What do you say to the claims that Janet Hardy\u0027s spirit haunts the house?\"\n \"My mother\u0027s spirit is here,\" Dilly said before Cilla could answer. \"She loved her little farm, and I believe her spirit, her voice, her beauty and her grace remain. We\u0027re proof of that.\" Dilly drew Cilla closer. \"Her spirit\u0027s in us. In me, in my daughter. And now, in some way, three generations of Hardy women are here. Now please, I need to get my daughter inside, where she can rest. I ask you, as a mother, to respect our privacy. If you have any more questions, my husband will try to answer them.\"\n Tipping her head close to Cilla\u0027s, Dilly turned and walked with her toward the house.\n \"A little heavy on the mother card,\" Cilla told her.\n \"I don\u0027t think so. What happened to the tree?\"\n \"What tree?\"\n \"That one, with the red leaves. It was bigger. A lot bigger.\"\n \"It was damaged, dead and dying. I replaced it.\"\n \"It looks different. There were more flowers.\" Dilly\u0027s voice shook, but Cilla knew it was uncalculated this time. \"Mama loved flowers.\"\n \"There will be more when it\u0027s done.\" Cilla felt the dynamic shift with every step until she supported Dilly. \"You\u0027ve trapped yourself. You have to go inside now.\"\n \"I know it. The porch was white. Why isn\u0027t it white?\"\n \"I had to replace most of it. It\u0027s not painted yet.\"\n \"The door\u0027s not right.\" Her breath quickened, as if they were running instead of walking. \"That\u0027s not her door. Why is everything changed?\"\n \"There was damage, there was mold and dry rot. My God, Mom, there\u0027s only been the very minimum of maintenance in the last decade, and not much more than that for twenty years before. You can\u0027t neglect without incurring damage.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t neglect it. I wanted to forget it. Now I can\u0027t, can I?\"\n Cilla felt her mother quiver, and would have soothed, but Dilly nudged her away as they walked inside.\n \"This is wrong. It\u0027s all wrong. Where are the walls? The little parlor? The paint\u0027s the wrong color.\"\n \"I made changes.\"\n Eyes hot and gleaming, she whirled toward Cilla on her fabulous shoes. \"You said you were restoring it.\"\n \"I said I was rehabbing it, and I am. I\u0027m making it mine, and respecting what it was.\"\n \"I\u0027d never have sold it to you if I\u0027d known you\u0027d tear it apart.\"\n \"Yes, you would,\" Cilla said coolly. \"You wanted the money, and I want to live here. If you\u0027d wanted it caught in amber, Mom, you had decades to do it. You don\u0027t love this house, it\u0027s a jagged edge for you. But I do love it.\"\n \"You don\u0027t know what I feel! I had more of her here than anywhere else. Second to Johnnie, of course, always second to her beloved son.\" Tears ripped through the words. \"But I had more of her when we were here than anywhere. And now it\u0027s all changed.\"\n \"No, not all. I had the plaster repaired, and the floor will be refinished. The floors she walked on. I\u0027m having the stove and refrigerator she used retrofitted, and I\u0027ll use them.\"\n \"That big old stove?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n Dilly pressed her fingers to her lips. \"She\u0027d try to bake cookies sometimes. She was terrible at it. She\u0027d always burn them, and laugh. We\u0027d eat them anyway. Damn it, Cilla. Damn it. I loved her so much.\"\n \"I know you did.\"\n \"She was going to take me to Paris. Just the two of us. It was all planned. Then Johnnie died. He always did spoil everything for me.\"\n \"God, Mom.\"\n \"That\u0027s how I felt then. After the shock, and that first awful grief because I did love him. I did love him even when I wanted to hate him.\n But after that, and when she wouldn\u0027t go to Paris, I thought, he\u0027s spoiled that for me.\" Dilly took a slow, hitching breath. \"She loved him more dead than she did me alive. No matter how hard I ran, I could never catch up.\"\n I know how you feel, Cilla thought. Just exactly. In her way, Dilly loved her mother dead more than she could love her daughter alive.\n Maybe this was about redemption, too. So Cilla took another step. \"I think she loved you very, very much. I think things got horribly twisted and broken the summer he died. And she never fully mended. If she\u0027d had more time-\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t she take it, then? She took the pills instead. She left me. She left me. Accident or not-and I\u0027ll always, always believe it was an accident-she took the pills, when she could\u0027ve taken me.\"\n \"Mom.\" Moving to her, Cilla touched Dilly\u0027s cheek. \"Why didn\u0027t you ever tell me that before? How you felt?\"\n \"It\u0027s this house. It upsets me. It dredges everything up. I don\u0027t want it. I just don\u0027t want it.\" She opened her purse, took out a silver pill case. \"Get me some water, Cilla. Bottled.\"\n The irony, Cilla thought, would forever be lost on Dilly. The daughter who grieved because her mother chose pills over her, perpetuated the same behavior.\n \"All right.\"\n In the kitchen, Cilla pulled a bottle of water out of her mini fridge. She got a glass, added ice. Dilly would have to live without her usual slice of lemon, she mused. Pouring the water, she glanced out.\n Ford stood with Brian and her pond expert by the choked waters. He held a mug of coffee, and the thumb of his other hand was hooked through one of the belt loops of his jeans.\n Long and lean, she thought, with just that hint of gawky. Messy brown hair with sun-kissed tips. So wonderfully, blessedly normal. It steadied her just to look at him, to know he\u0027d stay-this man who created super-villains and heroes, who had every season of Battlestar Galactica-both series-on DVD. A man who, she was fairly certain, didn\u0027t know an Allen wrench from a Crescent, and trusted her to handle herself.

So she comes to Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley to save the dilapidated farmhouse that once belonged to her grandmother—a legendary actress who died of an overdose more than thirty years ago. \n Plunging into the project with gusto, Cilla’s almost too busy and exhausted to notice her neighbor, graphic novelist Ford Sawyer. Determined not to carry on the family tradition of ill-fated romances, Cilla steels herself against Ford’s quirky charm, though she can’t help indulging in a little fantasy. \n But it’s reality that holds its share of dangers for Cilla. A cache of unsigned letters found in the attic points to a mysterious romance in her grandmother’s life—and may be the catalyst for a frightening, violent assault. And if Cilla and Ford are unable to sort out who is targeting her and why, she may, like her world-famous grandmother, be cut down in the prime of her life.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/tribute.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/tribute.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:03 AM"}}
