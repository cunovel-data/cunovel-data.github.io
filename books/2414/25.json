{"id":75457,"no":25,"title":"Page 25","content":"Cilla used Sunday morning to pore through home and design magazines, scout the Internet for ideas and vendors and tear out or bookmark possibilities and potentials. She could hardly believe she\u0027d reached the stage where she could begin considering furniture. Weeks away, of course, and she needed to add in trolling antique stores, even flea markets-and possibly yard sales-but she was approaching the time when ordering sofas and chairs, tables and lamps, wouldn\u0027t be out of line. Then there was bedding, she mused, a kitchen to outfit, an office, window treatments, rugs. All those fun, picky little details to fill in a house. To make a house a home. Her home. Her first real home. The closer it came to reality, the more she realized just how much she wanted home. All she had to do was step outside, look across the road and see it. Sitting here now, at Ford\u0027s counter, with her laptop, her magazines, her notebooks, she thought of just how far she\u0027d come since March. No, well before March, she corrected. She\u0027d started this journey on that long-ago trek through the Blue Ridge, one she\u0027d taken specifically, deliberately to see, firsthand, her grandmother\u0027s Little Farm, to see where her own father sprang from, and maybe to understand, a little, why he\u0027d come back, and left her. And she\u0027d fallen in love, Cilla thought now, with the hills that bumped their way back to the mountains, the thick spread of trees, the little towns and the big ones, the houses and gardens, the winding roads and streams. Most of all, she\u0027d fallen in love with the old farmhouse sagging behind a stone wall, closed in by its desolate, overgrown gardens. Sleeping Beauty\u0027s castle, maybe, she mused, but she\u0027d seen home, even then. Now, what she\u0027d dreamed of, yearned for, was very nearly hers. She sat at the counter, sipping coffee, and imagined waking in a room with walls the color of a glowing and hopeful dawn, and of living a life she\u0027d chosen rather than one chosen for her. Ford gave a sleepy grunt as he walked in. Look at him, she thought. Barely awake, that long, long, lean, edging-toward-gawky body dressed in navy boxers and a tattered Yoda T-shirt. All that sun-streaked brown hair rumpled and messy, and those green eyes groggy and just a little cranky. Wasn\u0027t he just unbelievably adorable? He dumped coffee into a mug, added sugar, milk. Said, \"God, mornings suck through a straw,\" and drank as if his life balanced within the contents of the mug. Then he turned, to prop his elbow on the counter. \"How come you look so lucid?\" \"Maybe because I\u0027ve been up for three hours. It\u0027s after ten, Ford.\" \"You have no respect for the Sunday.\" \"It\u0027s true. I\u0027m ashamed.\" \"No, you\u0027re not. But real estate agents also have no respect for the Sunday. Vicky just called my cell and woke me from a very hot dream involving you, me and finger paints. It was really getting interesting when I was so rudely and annoyingly interrupted. Anyway, the sellers came down another five thousand.\" \"Finger paints?\" \"And as an artist I can say it was the beginning of a masterpiece. We\u0027re only ten thousand apart now, as Vicky the dream killer pointed out. So...\" \"No.\" \"Damn it.\" He looked like a kid who\u0027d just been told there were no cookies in the jar. \"I knew you were going to say no, which you did not say when I was swirling cobalt blue around your belly button. Couldn\u0027t we just-\" \"No. You\u0027ll thank me later when you have that ten k to put into improvements and repairs.\" \"But I really want that ugly dump now. I want it for my own. I love it, Cilla, like a fat kid loves cake.\" He tried a hopeful smile. \"We could split the difference.\" \"No. We hold firm. No one else has made an offer on the property. The seller isn\u0027t interested in making any of those repairs and improvements. He\u0027ll cave.\" \"Maybe he won\u0027t.\" Those groggy eyes narrowed into a scowl. \"Maybe he\u0027s just as pigheaded as you are.\" \"Okay, here\u0027s this.\" She leaned back, an expert at the negotiation table. \"If he doesn\u0027t cave, if he doesn\u0027t accept your offer within two weeks, you can counter with the split. But you hold tight for fourteen more days.\" \"Okay. Two weeks.\" He tried the hopeful smile again. \"Do you ever think about scrambling eggs?\" \"Hardly ever. But I am thinking about something else. I\u0027m thinking, looking at that big, soft sofa over there-as I\u0027ve been in the sofa-hunting mode. And wondering, as I\u0027m thinking, what would happen if I stretched out on that big, soft sofa.\" She slid off the stool, aiming a smile over her shoulder as she strolled to the sofa. \"And I\u0027m wondering will I have to lie here all by myself, all alone with my unquenched desires and lascivious thoughts.\" \"Okay, lascivious did it.\" He skirted the counter, crossed, then pounced. \"Hi.\" With a low laugh, she scissored her legs, reared and rolled until their positions reversed. \"I think I\u0027ll be high this time.\" Dipping down, she caught his bottom lip between her teeth, chewed lightly. \"This is how I respect the Sunday.\" \"I was so wrong about you.\" He ran his hands down her, over the loose, white tank. \"Cilla.\" \"You\u0027re all rumpled and sexy and...\" She peeled Yoda off, tossed him away. \"Mostly naked.\" \"All we\u0027re missing are the finger paints.\" He pushed up, locking his arms around her, fixing his mouth to hers. \"I miss you. As soon as I\u0027m awake and you\u0027re not there.\" \"I\u0027m not far.\" She wrapped around him, only separating to let him strip the white tank away. And, oh, those hands, those slow, steady hands. \"Here. Here.\" She cupped his head, guided it down until his mouth closed over her breast. Everything coiled and curled inside her, and opened again. She wanted, wanted, with those hands pressing, that mouth feasting. Wanted him inside her, hot and hard. She wiggled out of her shorts, gasping as he touched and teased, moaning as she rose up, eased down, and filled herself with him. \"This is what I want, on Sunday morning.\" She took him, riding up, riding down, her hands braced on the arm of the couch. Slim, hard muscles, burnt honey hair, iced blue eyes so clear they were a mirror into his heart. No dream, no fantasy came close to the truth of her. No wish, no wonder compared. \"I love you, Cilla. I love you.\" Her breath caught; her heart skipped beats. Her body bowed, and the arrow it shot struck home. She slid down to him, snuggled right in. He loved the way they fit, line to line, the way her hair felt against his skin. \"So... where exactly do you buy finger paints?\" He grinned, lazily walked his fingers up and down her spine. \"I\u0027ll find out, lay in a supply.\" \"I\u0027ll provide the drop cloth. Where did you get this couch?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Somewhere where they sell furniture.\" \"It\u0027s a good size, shape, nice fabric. Comfortable. I need to start thinkingfurniture, and I have that great big living room to deal with. Conversation areas and lighting and art. I\u0027ve never done all that before. It\u0027s a little intimidating.\" He glanced over when Spock wandered in, took one look at them twined together naked on the couch and walked away. Just jealous, Ford thought. \"Never bought furniture before?\" \"Sure, you\u0027ve got to sit on something. But I\u0027ve never chosen things with the idea of keeping them any length of time. It\u0027s always been temporary. \" She brushed her lips over his collarbone, nuzzled at his shoulder. \"And I\u0027ve worked with stagers on flips. Staging a property can help it sell. So I know, or have opinions, about what works in a space. But this is different. Staging\u0027s like a set. Load it in, break it down.\" \"Didn\u0027t you have a house, an apartment, something in L.A.?\" \"Steve had a place. After our five-minute marriage I lived at the BHH awhile.\" \"The BHH?\" \"Beverly Hills Hotel. Then I traveled some, or stayed at Steve\u0027s when I picked up some work. There was my very brief college stint, and I had an apartment off campus. When Steve bought the property in Brentwood to flip, I camped there. I got in the habit of staying in the flip houses. It gave me a sense of them.\" Place, house, property. Never home, he thought. She\u0027d never had what he and everyone he knew took for granted. She\u0027d never had home. He thought of how she\u0027d sat in the big, empty living room with its beautiful walls and gorgeous trim, and imagined a long-ago holiday party. She was reaching back to find her future. \"We can move the couch over there,\" he said, suddenly desperate to give her something. \"You could see how it looks in place and have something to sit on besides the ever-versatile bucket.\" \"That\u0027s a very nice offer.\" She gave him an absent kiss before sitting up to hunt for her clothes. \"But it\u0027s more practical to wait for furniture until after the floors are done. Of course, now that I\u0027ve gotten trapped into giving a party, I\u0027d better find some suitable outdoor furniture.\" \"Party?\" \"Didn\u0027t I tell you?\" She pulled on her tank. \"I made the mistake of mentioning to Cathy Morrow that I\u0027d like-maybe-to give a party around Labor Day, but the house wouldn\u0027t be finished or furnished. She jumped right on the first part, completely ignored the second. Now I\u0027ve got Patty calling me with menu ideas, and your mother offering to make her pork barbecue.\" \"It\u0027s great stuff.\" \"No doubt. The problem remains how I find time to squeeze in party planning while I\u0027m installing kitchen cabinets, running trim, hanging doors, refinishing floors and hitting a very long punch-out list, not to mention exploring the world of sofas, couches, divans and settees.\" \"You buy a grill, a bunch of meat and a whole lot of alcoholic beverages. \" She shook her head at him. \"You\u0027re a man.\" \"I am. A fact which I\u0027ve just proven beyond any reasonable doubt.\" And being Sunday, he should get a shot at proving it again. \"A party\u0027s a good thing, Cilla. People come, people you know and like, enjoy being with. You show off what you\u0027ve done. You share it. That\u0027s why you took down the gate.\" \"I...\" He was right. \"What kind of grill?\" He smiled at her. \"We\u0027ll shop.\" In an exaggerated gesture, she crossed her hands over her heart. \"Words most women only dream about hearing from a man. I need to go get dressed. I could pick up paint while we\u0027re out, and hardware, take another look at kitchen lighting.\" \"What have I wrought?\" She tossed a smile at him as she walked out of the room. \"We\u0027ll take my truck.\" He dragged on his boxers, but stayed where he was, thinking about her. She didn\u0027t realize how much she\u0027d told him. She\u0027d never once mentioned the house, or houses, where she\u0027d grown up. He, on the other hand, could describe in perfect detail the house of his childhood, the way the sun slanted or burst through the windows of his room at any given time of the day, the green sink in the bathroom, the chip in the kitchen tile where he\u0027d dropped a gallon jug of apple juice. He remembered the pang when his parents had sold it, even though he\u0027d been in New York, even though he\u0027d moved out. Even though they\u0027d only moved a couple miles away. Years later, he could still drive by that old brick house and feel that pang. Lovingly restored trim, letters hidden in a book, an old barn painted red again. All of that, every step and detail, were links she forged herself to make a chain of connection. He\u0027d do whatever he could do to help her forge it, even if it came down to shopping for a grill. \"Hey, Ford.\" \"Back here,\" Ford called out when he heard Brian\u0027s voice, and unfolded himself off the sofa as Brian walked in. \"Weber or Viking?\" \"Tough choice,\" Brian said without any need for explanation. \"I went with the Weber, as you know, but a man can\u0027t go wrong with the Viking.\" \"How about a woman?\" \"Women have no place behind a grill. That\u0027s my stand on it.\" He bent down, picked up Ford\u0027s discarded T-shirt. \"This is a clue. It tells me that I\u0027ve come too late to interrupt morning sex. Damn that second cup of coffee.\" He tossed the shirt at Ford\u0027s face, then leaned down to greet Spock. \"You\u0027re just jealous because you didn\u0027t have any morning sex.\" \"How do you know?\" \"Because you\u0027re here. Why are you here?\" Brian gestured to the counter and Cilla\u0027s research pile as he crossed over to open Ford\u0027s refrigerator. \"Where\u0027s Cilla?\" \"Upstairs, getting dressed so we can go out and debate between Weber and Viking.\" \"You\u0027ve got Diet Cokes in here,\" Brian observed as he pulled out a can of the real thing. \"A sure sign a guy is hooked. I went by my mom\u0027s yesterday.\" Brian popped the top, took a swig. \"Hauled off, to her surprised joy, not one but two boxes of junk she\u0027s saved for me. What am I supposed to do with a crayon drawing of a house, a big yellow sun and stick people?\" \"I don\u0027t know, but you can\u0027t throw it out. According to my mother, dumping any childhood memorabilia they saved dares the gods.\" Ford got his own Coke. \"I have three boxes.\" \"I won\u0027t forget it\u0027s your fault I took possession of that stuff.\" He pulled an envelope out of his pocket, tossed it on the counter. \"However, as I didn\u0027t score female companionship last night, I went through some of it, came up with this. It\u0027s a card my grandfather gave my mother on the occasion of my birth. He wrote some stuff in it.\" \"Thanks. I owe you one.\" \"Damn right. I am now housing every report card I got from first grade through high school. You\u0027ll let me know if it matches. I\u0027m kind of into it now.\" \"One way or the other.\" Ford picked up the card, studied the strong, bold lettering of Cathy\u0027s name. \"I gotta go, pick up Shanna. I\u0027m driving her to the airport.\" He squatted down, rubbing Spock\u0027s head, the wiggling body. \"Tell Cilla I\u0027ll have a couple guys there tomorrow to finish that mulching, and I should be able to swing by the new place she\u0027s buying, take a look at the yard.\" \"Okay. I\u0027ll get this back to you.\" Brian smirked at the card. \"Yeah, I\u0027m worried about that.\" Ford went upstairs, into the bedroom where Cilla was pulling her hair back into a tail. \"I\u0027m set,\" she told him. \"I\u0027m going to go over while you\u0027re getting dressed, take another look at a couple things before we go.\" \"Brian just came by.\" \"Oh, did he look at the new property already?\" \"No, next week, he said. He brought this.\" Ford held up the card. \"Is that... Of course it is. I didn\u0027t expect him to find something so fast. Wow.\" She pressed a hand to her belly. \"Big mystery could be solved. It makes me a little nervous.\" \"Do you want me to go check it out, then just tell you?\" She dropped her hand. \"What am I? A weenie?\" \"No, you\u0027re not.\" \"Then let\u0027s do it.\" \"They\u0027re in my office.\" She went in with him, watched him take the book off the shelf, then set it on the counter for her to open. \"I keep thinking how she chose Gatsby. The rich, shining life, the glitter and then ennui, romance, betrayal, ultimate tragedy. She was so unhappy. I dreamed of her again not long ago. I didn\u0027t tell you. One of my Janet and Cilla dreams. Forest Lawn. They\u0027re both buried there. Her and Johnnie. I only went there once. Her grave was literally covered with flowers. It made me sad to look at it. All those flowers, brought by strangers, fading in the sun.\" \"You planted them for her here instead. And even when they fade, they come back new. Year after year.\" \"I like to think that would matter to her. My personal tribute.\" She opened the book, took the stack of letters out. \"I\u0027ll open this,\" she said, choosing one. \"You open that.\" Ford took out the card. He\u0027d expected a happy picture of a baby, or a sentimental one of a mother and child. Instead he found Andrew Morrow\u0027s initials on heavy, cream-colored stock. \"Pretty formal,\" he commented, and opened the card. Congratulations to my lovely daughter-in-law on the birth of her son. I hope these roses bring you pleasure. They\u0027re only a small token of my great pride. Another generation of Morrows is born with Brian Andrew. Affectionately, Drew Cilla laid the letter beside the card. My Dear. My Darling. There are no words to express my sorrow, my sympathy, my grief for you. I wish I could hold you, could comfort you now with more than words on a page. Know that I\u0027m with you in my heart, that my thoughts are full of you. No mother should have to suffer the loss of her child, and then be forced to grieve in so public a manner. I know you loved your Johnnie beyond measure. If there can be comfort now, take it in knowing he felt that love every day of his short life. Only Yours \"Is that fitting, is that fate?\" Cilla said quietly. \"That I\u0027d choose the loss of a son to compare to the birth of another? It\u0027s a kind letter,\" she continued. \"They\u0027re both kind notes, and both strangely distant, so carefully worded, I think. When each occasion should have filled the page with emotions and intimacies. The tone, the structure. They could be from the same person.\" \"The writing\u0027s similar. Not... well, not exactly exact. See the S\u0027s in the card? When he starts a word-son, small-with an S, it\u0027s in curvy print. In the letter-sorry, sympathy-traditional lowercase cursive.\" \"But the uppercase T\u0027s are written the same way, and the Y\u0027s. The slant of the writing. It\u0027s very close. And they were written years apart.\" \"My and my in both really look like the same hand, and the uppercase I\u0027s, but the uppercase D\u0027s, not so much.\" Ford knew he looked with an artist\u0027s eye, and wasn\u0027t sure if that was a plus or a minus. \"Then again, in the card, that\u0027s a signature. Some people write the first letter of their signature differently than they might a word. I don\u0027t know, Cilla.\" \"Results, inconclusive. I don\u0027t suppose you know any handwriting experts.\" \"We could find one.\" He looked up, into her eyes. \"Do you want to go that route?\" \"No. Maybe. I don\u0027t know. Damn it. No easy answers.\" \"Maybe we could get our hands on a sample closer to when the letters were written. I can ask Brian to try for that.\" \"Let\u0027s just put it away for now.\" She folded the letter, slipped it back into the envelope. \"We know one thing after this. It wasn\u0027t Hennessy. I\u0027d forgotten about the letter after Johnnie\u0027s death. No way, even if he was crazy in love, would he have written that after the accident. Not when he was with his own son in the hospital.\" \"You\u0027re right.\" \"So, if I had a list, I\u0027d be able to cross a name off. That\u0027s something. I guess it\u0027s going to have to be enough for now. At least for now.\" Ford closed the book, put it back on the shelf. He turned to her, took her hand. \"What do you say we go buy a grill?\" \"I\u0027d say that\u0027s exactly what I want to do.\" But he left the monogrammed note on his desk when he went to dress. He could find a graphologist. Someone outside Virginia to whom the name Andrew Morrow meant nothing. And he could see where that led. CILLA\u0027S PLEASURE WHEN her walnut flooring finally arrived Tuesday morning hit a major roadblock before noon when her tile layer stormed over to her work area beside the barn. \"Hi, Stan. You\u0027re not scheduled until Thursday. Are...\" She found herself backpedaling quickly as she caught the murderous look in his eye. \"Hey, hey, what\u0027s the problem?\" \"You think you can treat people that way? You think you can talk to people that way?\" \"What? What?\" He backed her right up into the side of the barn. Too shocked at seeing the usually affable Stan with a vein throbbing in the center of his forehead, Cilla held up her hands as much in defense as a gesture of peace. \"You think \u0027cause you come from money and got yourself on TV you\u0027re better than the rest of us?\" \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about. Where-\" \"You got some nerve, goddamn it, calling my wife, talking to her like that.\" \"I never-\" \"You got a problem with my work, you talk to me. You got that? Don\u0027t you go calling my house and yelling at my wife.\" \"Stan, I\u0027ve never spoken to your wife.\" \"You calling her a liar now?\" He shoved his face into hers, so close she could taste his rage. \"I\u0027m not calling her anything.\" Alarm lumped at the base of Cilla\u0027s throat, so she spaced her words carefully. \"I don\u0027t know her, and I don\u0027t know what the hell you\u0027re talking about.\" \"I come home and she\u0027s so upset she can barely talk. Started crying. The only reason I didn\u0027t come straight over here last night is she begged me not to, and I didn\u0027t want to leave her when she was in that state. She\u0027s got hypertension, and you go setting her off \u0027cause you decide you don\u0027t like my work.\" \"And I\u0027m telling you, I never called your house, I never spoke to your wife, and I\u0027m not dissatisfied with your work. In fact, the opposite. Or why in God\u0027s name did I contract you to lay the floor in my kitchen?\" \"You tell me, goddamn it.\" \"Well, I can\u0027t!\" she shouted back at him. \"What time was I supposed to have made this call?\" \"About ten o\u0027clock last night, you know damn well. I get home about ten-thirty, and she\u0027s lying down, flushed and shaking because you screamed at her like a crazy woman.\" \"Have you ever heard me scream like a crazy woman? I was at Ford\u0027s last night at ten o\u0027clock. I nodded off in front of the TV. Ask him. Jesus, Stan, you\u0027ve been working here off and on for months now. You should know I don\u0027t handle things that way.\" \"Said it was you. Cilla McGowan.\" But puzzlement began to show through the temper. \"You told Kay she was a stupid hick, just like most of the people around here. How I couldn\u0027t lay tile for shit, and you were going to make sure word got out. When I lost work, I\u0027d have nobody to blame but my own lazy ass. How maybe you\u0027d sue me over the crap job I did for you.\" \"If your wife\u0027s a hick, I am, too. I live here now. I don\u0027t contract with subs who do crap work. In fact, I recommended you to my stepmother just last week, if she ever talks my father into updating their master bath.\" She realized she was breathless from reaction, but the alarm had dissolved. \"Why the hell would I do that, Stan, if I thought your work was crap?\" \"She didn\u0027t just make it up.\" \"Okay.\" She had to draw in air. \"Okay. Is she sure whoever called gave my name?\" \"Cilla McGowan, and then Kay said you... they,\" he corrected, obviously ready to give Cilla the benefit of the doubt, \"said, \u0027Do you know who I am?\u0027 in that bitchy way people do when they think they\u0027re important. Then just laid into her. It took me almost an hour to calm her down when I got home from the summer league. I had to make her take a Tylenol P.M. to help her sleep. She was that upset.\" \"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m sorry somebody used my name to upset her. I don\u0027t know why...\" Pressure lowered onto her chest, pushed and pushed. \"The flooring supplier said I called in and changed my order. Walnut to oak. But I didn\u0027t. I thought there\u0027d just been a mix-up. Maybe it wasn\u0027t. Maybe somebody\u0027s screwing with me.\" Stan stood a moment, stuck his hands in his pockets, pulled them out again. \"You never made that call.\" \"No, I didn\u0027t. Stan, I\u0027m trying to build a reputation, and a business here. I\u0027m trying to build relationships with subs and service people. When someone broke in and went at the bathrooms, you juggled me in for the repair and re-lay, and I know you cut me a break on the labor.\" \"You had a problem. And the fact is, I was proud of that work and wanted to make it right.\" \"I don\u0027t know how to make this right with your wife. I could talk to her, try to explain.\" \"Better let me do that.\" He blew out a breath. \"Sorry I came at you.\" \"I\u0027d have done the same in your place.\" \"Who\u0027d do something like this? Mess with you, get Kay all upset?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" Cilla thought of Mrs. Hennessy. Her husband was doing two years in a psych facility. \"But I hope I can head it off before it happens again.\" \"I guess I\u0027d better swing by home, straighten this out with Kay.\" \"Okay. You still on for Thursday?\" His smile was a little sheepish. \"Yeah. Ah, you got any reason to call me at home, maybe you should come up with a code word or something. \" \"Maybe I should.\" She stood in the shadow of her barn, with trim propped against the wall and laid out to dry, stretched across her sawhorses. And wondered how many times she\u0027d have to pay for the crimes, sins, mistakes of others.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tribute/page-25.html","bookId":2414,"book":{"id":2414,"title":"Tribute","description":"Storyline: Cilla McGowan, a former child star, has found a more satisfying life restoring homes.
