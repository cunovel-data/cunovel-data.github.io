{"id":75435,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"Ford spent two full hours watching Cilla through his binoculars, sketching her from various angles. After all, the way she moved jump-started the concept every bit as much as the way she looked. The lines, the curves, the shape, the coloring-all part of it. But movement, that was key. Grace and athleticism. Not balletic, no, not that. More... the sort of grace of a sprinter. Strength and purpose rather than art and flow.\\n\\n A warrior\u0027s grace, he thought. Economical and deadly.\\n\\n He wished he could get a look at her with her hair down and loose instead of pulled back in a tail. A good look at her arms would help and her legs. And hell, any other parts of her that might pop into view wouldn\u0027t hurt his feelings any.\\n\\n He\u0027d Googled her, and studied several photographs, and he\u0027d NetFlixed her movies, so he\u0027d have those to study. But the last movie she\u0027d done-I\u0027m Watching,Too!-was about eight years old.\\n\\n He wanted the woman, not the girl.\\n\\n He already had the story line in his head, crammed in there and shoving to get out. He\u0027d cheated the night before, taking a couple hours away from his latest Seeker novel to draft the outline. And maybe he was cheating just a little bit more today, but he wanted to do a couple of pencils, and he didn\u0027t want to do those until he had more detailed sketches.\\n\\n The trouble was, his model had too many damn clothes on.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d really like to see her naked,\" he said, and Spock gave a kind of smart-assed snort. \"Not that way. Well, yeah, that way, too. Who wouldn\u0027t? But I\u0027m speaking professionally.\"\\n\\n There came growlings and groanings now, with Spock rolling to his side. \"I am a professional. They pay me and everything, which is why I can buy your food.\"\\n\\n Spock snagged the small, mangled bear he carted around, rolled again and dropped it on Ford\u0027s foot. Then began to dance hopefully in place. \"We\u0027ve been through this before. You\u0027re responsible for feeding him.\"\\n\\n Ignoring the dog, Ford thought of Cilla again. He\u0027d pay another \"Hi, neighbor\" call. See if he could talk her into posing for him.\\n\\n Inside, he loaded up his sketch pad, his pencils, tucked in a copy of The Seeker: Vanished, then considered what he might have around the house to serve as a bribe.\\n\\n He settled on a nice bottle of cabernet, shoved that into the bag, then started the hike across the road. Spock deserted the bear and scrambled up to follow.\\n\\n SHE SAW HIM COMING as she hauled another load of trash and debris out to the Dumpster she\u0027d rented. Inside the house she\u0027d started piles of wood and trim she hoped to salvage. The rest? It had to go. Sentiment didn\u0027t magically restore rotted wood.\\n\\n Cilla tossed the pile, then set her gloved hands on her hips. What did her hot-looking neighbor and appealingly ugly dog want now?\\n\\n He\u0027d shaved, she noted. So the scruffy look might\u0027ve been laziness rather than design. She preferred laziness. Over one shoulder he carried a large leather satchel, and as he came down her drive, he lifted a hand in a friendly greeting.\\n\\n Spock sniffed around the Dumpster and seemed happy to lift his leg.\\n\\n \"Hey. You\u0027ve had a lot going on here the last couple of days.\"\\n\\n \"No point wasting time.\"\\n\\n His grin spread slow and easy. \"Wasting time can be the point.\" He glanced at the Dumpster. \"Are you gutting the place?\"\\n\\n \"Not entirely, but more than I\u0027d hoped. Neglect takes longer to damage than deliberation, but it does the job just as well. Hello, Spock.\" At the greeting the dog walked over, offered a paw. Okay, Cilla thought as they shook. Ugly but charming. \"What can I do for you, Ford?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m working up to that. But first, I brought you this.\" He dug into the satchel, came out with the bottle of red.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s nice. Thanks.\"\\n\\n \"And this.\" He drew out the graphic novel. \"A little reading material with your wine at the end of the day. It\u0027s what I do.\"\\n\\n \"Drink wine and read comic books?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, actually, but I meant I write them.\"\\n\\n \"So my father told me, and I was being sarcastic.\"\\n\\n \"I got that. I speak sarcasm, as well as many other languages. Do you ever read them?\"\\n\\n Funny guy, she thought, with his funny dog. \"I crammed in a lot of Batman when they were casting Batgirl for the Clooney version. I lost out to Alicia Silverstone.\"\\n\\n \"Probably just as well, the way that one turned out.\"\\n\\n Cilla cocked an eyebrow. \"Let me repeat. George Clooney.\"\\n\\n Ford could only shake his head. \"Michael Keaton was Batman. It\u0027s all about the I\u0027m-a-little-bit-crazy eyes. Plus they lost the operatic sense after the Keaton movies. And don\u0027t get me started on Val Kilmer.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. Anyway, I prepped for the audition by studying the previous movies-and yes, Keaton was fabulous-reading some of the comics, boning up on the mythology. I probably overprepped.\"\\n\\n She shrugged off what had been a major blow to her at sixteen. \"You do your own art?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" He studied her as she studied the cover. Look at that mouth, he thought, and the angle of her chin. His fingers itched for his pad and pencil. \"I\u0027m territorial and egotistical. Nobody can do it the way I do it, so nobody gets the chance.\"\\n\\n She flipped through as he spoke. \"It\u0027s a lot. I always think of comics as about twenty pages of bright colors and characters going BAM! ZAP! Your art\u0027s strong and vivid, with a lot of dark edges.\"\\n\\n \"The Seeker has a lot of dark edges. I\u0027m finishing up a new one. It should be done in a few days. It would\u0027ve been done today, probably, if you hadn\u0027t distracted me.\"\\n\\n The wine tucked in the curve of her arm took on another level of weight. \"How did I do that?\"\\n\\n \"The way you look, the way you move. I\u0027m not hitting on you on a personal level.\" He slid his gaze down. \"Yet,\" he qualified. \"It\u0027s a professional tap. I\u0027ve been trying to come up with a new character, the central for another series, apart from the Seeker. A woman-female power, vulnerabilities, viewpoints, problems. And the duality... Not important for today\u0027s purposes,\" he said. \"You\u0027re my woman.\"\\n\\n \"I beg your pardon?\"\\n\\n \"Dr. Cass Murphy, archaeologist, professor of same. Cool, quiet, solitary woman whose heart really lies in the field work. The discovery. Prodigy. Nobody gets too close to Cass. She\u0027s all business. That\u0027s the way she was raised. She\u0027s emotionally repressed.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m emotionally repressed?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know yet, but she is. See.\" He pulled out his sketchbook, flipped to a page. Angling her head, Cilla studied the drawing, studied herself if she wore conservative suits, sensible pumps and glasses.\\n\\n \"She looks boring.\"\\n\\n \"She wants to look boring. She doesn\u0027t want to be noticed. If people notice her, they might get in the way, and they might make her feel things she doesn\u0027t want to feel. Even on a dig, she... See?\"\\n\\n \"Hmm. Not boring but efficient and practical. Maybe subtly sexy, given the mannish cut of the shirt and pants. She\u0027s more comfortable this way.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly. You\u0027ve got a knack for this.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve read my share of storyboards. I don\u0027t know your field, but I can\u0027t see much of a story with this character.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Cass has layers,\" he assured her. \"We just have to uncover them the way she uncovers artifacts at a dig. The way she\u0027ll uncover an ancient weapon and symbol of power when she\u0027s trapped in a cave on a mythical island I have to create, after she discovers the dastardly plans of the billionaire backer of the project, who\u0027s also an evil sorcerer.\"\\n\\n \"Naturally.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got some work to do there, but here she is. Brid, Warrior Goddess.\"\\n\\n \"Wow.\" It was really all she could think of. She was all leather and legs, breastplate and boobs. The boring and practical had become the bold, dangerous and sexy. She stood, legs planted in knee-high boots, masses of hair swirling and a short-handled, double-headed hammer lofted skyward.\\n\\n \"You might\u0027ve exaggerated the cup size,\" she commented.\\n\\n \"The... Oh, well, it\u0027s hard to tell. Besides, the architecture of the breastplate\u0027s bound to give them a boost. But you hit on what you can do for me. Pose. I can get what I need from candid sketches, but I\u0027d get better with-\"\\n\\n \"Whoa.\" She slapped her hand over his as he flipped to a page covered with small drawings of her. \"Those aren\u0027t character sketches. That\u0027s me.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, same thing, essentially.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve been over there, watching me over here, making drawings of me without my consent? You don\u0027t see that as rude and intrusive?\"\\n\\n \"No, I see it as work. If I snuck over here and peeked in your windows, that would be rude and intrusive. You move like an athlete with just a hint of dancer. Even when you\u0027re standing still there\u0027s a punch to it. That\u0027s what I need. I don\u0027t need your permission to base a character on your physicality, but I\u0027d do a better job with your cooperation.\"\\n\\n She shoved his hand away to flip back to the warrior goddess. \"That\u0027s my face.\"\\n\\n \"And a great face it is, too.\"\\n\\n \"If I said I\u0027m calling my lawyer?\"\\n\\n At Ford\u0027s feet, Spock grumbled. \"That would be shortsighted and hard-assed. And your choice. I don\u0027t think you\u0027d get anywhere, but to save myself the hassle, I can make a few alterations. Wider mouth, longer nose. Make her a redhead-a redhead\u0027s not a bad idea. Sharper cheekbones. Let\u0027s see.\"\\n\\n He dug out a pencil, flipped to a fresh page. While Cilla watched, he drew a quick freehand sketch.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m keeping the eyes,\" he muttered as he worked. \"You\u0027ve got killer eyes. Widen the mouth, exaggerate the bottom lip just a hair more, diamond-edge those cheekbones, lengthen the nose. It\u0027s rough, but it\u0027s a great face, too.\"\\n\\n \"If you think you can goad me into-\"\\n\\n \"But I like yours better. Come on, Cilla. Who doesn\u0027t want to be a superhero? I promise you, Brid\u0027s going to kick a lot more ass than Batgirl.\"\\n\\n She hated feeling stupid, and feeling her temper shove at her. \"Go away. I\u0027ve got work to do.\"\\n\\n \"I take that as a no on posing for me.\"\\n\\n \"You can take that as, if you don\u0027t go away, I\u0027m going to get my own magic hammer and beat you over the head with it.\"\\n\\n Her hands curled into fists when he smiled at her. \"That\u0027s the spirit. Just let me know if you change your mind,\" he said as he slid the sketchbook back into his bag. \"See you later,\" he added and, tucking his pencil behind his ear, headed back down her driveway with his ugly little dog.\\n\\n SHE STEWED ABOUT IT. The physical labor helped work off the mad, but the stewing part had to run its course. It was just her luck, just her freaking luck, that she could move out to what was almost the middle of nowhere and end up with a nosy, pushy, intrusive neighbor who had no respect for boundaries or privacy.\\n\\n Her boundaries. Her privacy.\\n\\n All she wanted was to do what she wanted to do, in her own time, in her own way-and largely by herself. She wanted to build something here, make a life, make a living. On her own terms.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t mind the aches and pains of hard physical labor. In fact she considered them a badge of honor, along with every blister and callus.\\n\\n Damned if she wanted her steps, her movements documented by some pen-and-ink artist.\\n\\n \"Warrior goddess,\" she muttered under her breath as she cleaned out clogged and sagging gutters. \"Make her a redhead and give her collagen lips and D cups. Typical.\"\\n\\n She climbed down the extension ladder and, since the gutters completed her last chore of the day, stretched right out on the ground.\\n\\n She hurt every damn where.\\n\\n She wanted to soak herself limp in a Jacuzzi, and follow it up with an hour\u0027s massage. And top that off with a couple glasses of wine, and possibly sex with Orlando Bloom. After that, she might just feel human.\\n\\n Since the only thing on that wish list at hand was the wine, she\u0027d settle for that. When she could move again.\\n\\n With a sigh, she realized the stewing portion of the program was complete, and with her mind clear and her body exhausted, she knew the core reason for her reaction to Ford\u0027s sketches.\\n\\n A decade of therapy hadn\u0027t been wasted.\\n\\n So she groaned, pushed herself up. And went inside for the wine.\\n\\n WITH SPOCK and his bear snoring majestically, Ford inked the last panel. Though the final work would be in color, his technique was to approach the inking as a near completion of the final art.\\n\\n He\u0027d already inked the panel borders, and the outlines of the background objects with his 108 Hunt. After completing the light side of his foregrounds, he stepped back, squinted, studied, approved. Once again, the Seeker, shoulders slumped, eyes downcast, face half turned away, slipped back toward the shadows that haunted his existence.\\n\\n Poor sap.\\n\\n Ford cleaned the nib he\u0027d used, replaced it in its section of his worktable. He chose his brush, dipped it in India ink, then began to lay in the areas of shadow on his penciling with bold lines. Every few dips he rinsed the brush. The process took time, it took patience and a steady hand. As he envisioned large areas of black for this final, somber panel, he filled them in partially, knowing too much ink too fast would buckle his page.\\n\\n When the banging on the door downstairs-and Spock\u0027s answering barks of terror-interrupted him, he did what he always did with interruptions. He cursed at them. Once the cursing was done, he grunted a series of words-his little ritual incantation. He swirled the brush in water again and took it with him as he went down to answer.\\n\\n Irritation switched to curiosity when he saw Cilla standing on his veranda holding the bottle of cab.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re cool, Spock,\" he said, to shut up the madly barking dog trembling at the top of the stairs.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t like red?\" he asked Cilla when he opened the door.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t have a corkscrew.\"\\n\\n This time the dog greeted her with a couple of happy leaps, and an enthusiastic rub of his body against her legs. \"Nice to see you, too.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s relieved you\u0027re not invading forces from his home planet.\"\\n\\n \"So am I.\"\\n\\n The response had Ford grinning. \"Okay, come on in. I\u0027ll dig up a corkscrew.\" He took a couple steps down the foyer, stopped, turned back. \"Do you want to borrow a corkscrew, or do you want me to open the bottle so you can share?\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you open it?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d better come on back then. I have to clean my brush first.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re working. I\u0027ll just take the corkscrew.\"\\n\\n \"Indian giver. The work can wait. What time is it anyway?\"\\n\\n She noticed he wasn\u0027t wearing a watch, then checked her own. \"About seven-thirty.\"\\n\\n \"It can definitely wait, but the brush can\u0027t. Soap, water, corkscrew and glasses all conveniently located in the kitchen.\" He took her arm in a casual grip that was firm enough to get her where he wanted her.\\n\\n \"I like your house.\"\\n\\n \"Me too.\" He led the way down a wide hallway with lofty ceilings framed in creamy crown molding. \"I bought it pretty much as it stands. Previous owners did a good job fixing it up, so all I had to do was dump furniture in it.\"\\n\\n \"What sold you on it? There\u0027s usually one or two main hooks for a buyer. This,\" she added as she walked into the generous kitchen with its wide granite serving bar opening into a casual family room, \"would be one for me.\"\\n\\n \"Actually, it was the view, and the light from upstairs. I work upstairs, so that was key.\"\\n\\n He opened a drawer, located a corkscrew in a way that told her his spaces were organized. He set the tool aside, then stepped to the sink to wash the brush.\\n\\n Spock executed what looked like a bouncing, nail-tapping dance, then darted through a doorway. \"Where\u0027s he going?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m in the kitchen, which sends the food signal to his brain. That was his happy dance.\"\\n\\n \"Is that what it was?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, he\u0027s a pretty basic guy. Food makes him happy. He\u0027s got an autofeeder in the laundry room and a dog door. Anyway, the kitchen\u0027s pretty much wasted on me, and so was the dining area they set up over there since I don\u0027t actually dine so much as eat. I\u0027d be a pretty basic guy, too. But I like having space.\"\\n\\n He set up the cleaned brush bristles in a glass. \"Have a seat,\" he invited as he picked up the corkscrew.\\n\\n She sat at the bar, admired the stainless steel double ovens, the cherry cabinets, the six-burner range and grill combo under the shining stainless hood. And, since she wasn\u0027t blinded by end-of-the-day fatigue, his ass.\\n\\n He took two red wineglasses from one of the cabinets with textured glass doors, poured the wine. He stepped over, offered her one, then, lifting his own, leaned on the bar toward her and said, \"So.\"\\n\\n \"So. We\u0027re going to be across the road from each other for quite a while, most likely. It\u0027s better to smooth things out.\"\\n\\n \"Smooth is good.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s flattering to be seen as some mythical warrior goddess,\" she began. \"Odd but flattering. I might even get a kick out of it-the Xena-meets-Wonder-Woman, twenty-first-century style.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good, and not entirely off the mark.\"\\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t like the fact that you\u0027ve been watching me, or drawing me when I wasn\u0027t aware of it. It\u0027s a problem for me.\"\\n\\n \"Because you see it as an invasion of privacy. And I see it as natural observation.\"\\n\\n She took a drink. \"All my life, people watched me, took pictures. Observed me. Take a walk, shop for shoes, go for ice cream, it\u0027s a photo op. Maybe it was usually set up for that precise purpose, but I didn\u0027t have any control over that. Even though I\u0027m not in the business, I\u0027m still Janet Hardy\u0027s granddaughter, so it still happens from time to time.\"\\n\\n \"And you don\u0027t like it.\"\\n\\n \"Not only don\u0027t like it, I\u0027m done with it. I don\u0027t want to bring that by-product of Hollywood here.\"\\n\\n \"I can go with the second face, but I\u0027ve got to have the eyes.\"\\n\\n She took another drink. \"Here\u0027s the sticky part, for me. I don\u0027t want you to use the second face. I feel stupid about it, but I like the idea of being the inspiration for a comic book hero. And that is something I never thought I\u0027d hear myself say.\"\\n\\n Inside, Ford did a little happy dance of his own. \"So it\u0027s not the results, it\u0027s the process. You want something to eat? I want something to eat.\" He turned, opened another cupboard and pulled out a bag of Doritos.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not actual food.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what makes it good. All of my life,\" he continued as he dug into the bag, \"I\u0027ve watched people. Drawn pictures-well, I drew pictures as soon as I could hold a crayon. I\u0027ve observed-the way they move, gesture, the way their faces and bodies are put together. How they carry themselves. It\u0027s like breathing. Something I have to do. I could promise not to watch you, but I\u0027d be lying. I can promise to show you any sketching I do, and try to keep that promise.\"\\n\\n Because they were there, she ate a Dorito. \"What if I hate them?\"\\n\\n \"You won\u0027t, if you have any taste, but if you do, that would be too bad.\"\\n\\n Contemplating, she ate another chip. His voice had stayed easy, she noted-over the rigid steel underlying it. \"That\u0027s a hard line.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not what you\u0027d call flexible about my work. I can pretzel about most anything else.\"\\n\\n \"I know the type. What comes after the sketching?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got to have a story. Graphics is only half of a graphic novel. But you need to... Bring your wine. Come on upstairs.\"\\n\\n He retrieved his brush. \"I was inking the last panel on Payback when you knocked,\" he told her as he led her out of the kitchen and to the stairs.\\n\\n \"Are these stairs original?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\" His forehead creased as he looked down at them. \"Maybe. Why?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s beautiful work. The pickets, the banister, the finish. Someone took care of this place. It\u0027s a major contrast with mine.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you\u0027re taking care now. And you hired Matt-pal of mine-to do some of the carpentry. I know he worked on this place before I bought it. And did some stuff for me after.\" He turned into his studio.\\n\\n Cilla saw the gorgeous wide-planked chestnut floor, the beautiful tall windows and the wide, glossy trim. \"What a wonderful room.\"\\n\\n \"Big. It was designed as the master bedroom, but I don\u0027t need this much space to sleep.\"\\n\\n Cilla tuned into him again, and into the various workstations set up in the room. Five large, and very ugly, filing cabinets lined one wall. Shelves lined another with what seemed to be a ruthless organization of art supplies and tools. He\u0027d devoted another section to action figures and accessories. She recognized a handful of the collection, and wondered why Darth Vader and Superman appeared so chummy.\\n\\n A huge drawing board stood in the center of the room, currently holding what she assumed to be the panels he\u0027d talked about. Spreading out from it on either side, counters and cubbies held a variety of tools, pencils, brushes, reams of paper. Photographs, sketches, pictures torn or cut out of magazines of people, places, buildings. Still another leg of the counter held a computer, printer, scanner-a Buffy the Vampire Slayer action figure.\\n\\n Opposite that, to form a wide U, stood a full-length mirror.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a lot of stuff.\"\\n\\n \"It takes a lot of stuff. But for the art, which is what you want to know, I\u0027ll do a few million sketches, casting my people, costuming them, playing with background, foreground, settings-and somewhere in there I\u0027ll write the script, breaking that into panels. Then I\u0027ll do thumbnails- small, quick sketches to help me decide how I\u0027m going to divide my space, how I want to compose them. Then I pencil the panels. Then I ink the art, which is exactly what it sounds like.\"\\n\\n She stepped over to the drawing board. \"Black and white, light and shadow. But the book you gave me was done in color.\"\\n\\n \"So will this be. I used to do the coloring and the lettering by hand. It\u0027s fun,\" he told her, leaning a hip on one leg of the U, \"and really time-consuming. And if you go foreign, and I did, it\u0027s problematic to change hand-drawn balloons to fit the translations. So I digitized there. I scan the inked panels into the computer and work with Photoshop for coloring.\"\\n\\n \"The art\u0027s awfully good,\" Cilla stated. \"It almost tells the story without the captions. That\u0027s strong imaging.\"\\n\\n Ford waited a beat, then another. \"I\u0027m waiting for it.\"\\n\\n She glanced over her shoulder at him. \"For what?\"\\n\\n \"For you to ask why I\u0027m wasting my talent with comic books instead of pursuing a legitimate career in art.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll be waiting a long time. I don\u0027t see waste when someone\u0027s doing what they want to do, and something they excel at.\"\\n\\n \"I knew I was going to like you.\"\\n\\n \"Plus, you\u0027re talking to someone who starred for eight seasons on a half-hour sitcom. It wasn\u0027t Ibsen, but it sure as hell was legitimate. People will recognize me from your art. I\u0027m not on the radar so much anymore, but I look enough like my grandmother, and she is. She always will be. People will make the connection.\"\\n\\n \"Is that a problem for you?\"\\n\\n \"I wish I knew.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got a couple days to think about it. Or...\" He shifted, opened a drawer, drew out papers.\\n\\n \"You wrote up a release,\" Cilla said after a glance at the papers.\\n\\n \"I figured you\u0027d either come around or you wouldn\u0027t. If you did, we\u0027d get this out of the way.\"\\n\\n She stepped away, walked to the windows. The lights sparkled again, she thought. Little diamond glints in the dark. She watched them, and the dog currently chasing shadows in Ford\u0027s backyard. She sipped her wine. Then she turned her head to look at him over her shoulder. \"I\u0027m not posing in a breastplate.\"\\n\\n Humor hit his eyes an instant before he grinned. \"I can work around that.\"\\n\\n \"No nudity.\"\\n\\n \"Only for my personal collection.\"\\n\\n She let out a short laugh. \"Got a pen?\"\\n\\n \"A few hundred of them.\" He chose a standard roller ball as she crossed the room.\\n\\n \"Here\u0027s another condition. A personal, and petty, requirement. I want her to kick a lot more ass than Batgirl.\"\\n\\n \"Guaranteed.\"\\n\\n After she\u0027d signed the three copies, he handed her one. \"For your files. How about we pour another glass of this wine, order a pizza and celebrate the deal?\"\\n\\n She eased back. He hadn\u0027t stepped into her space; she\u0027d stepped into his. But the tingle in her blood warned her to mark the distance. \"No, thanks. You\u0027ve got work and so do I.\"\\n\\n \"Night\u0027s young.\" He walked out of the room with her. \"Tomorrow\u0027s long.\"\\n\\n \"Not as young as it was, and tomorrow\u0027s never long enough. Plus I need extra time to fantasize about putting in a Jacuzzi.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got one.\"\\n\\n She slid her eyes toward him as they came down the stairs. \"I don\u0027t suppose you have a massage therapist on tap, too.\"\\n\\n \"No, but I\u0027ve got really good hands.\"\\n\\n \"I bet you do. Well, if you were Orlando Bloom, I\u0027d consider this a sign from God and be sleeping with you in about ninety minutes. But since you\u0027re not\"-she opened the front door herself-\"I\u0027ll say good night.\"\\n\\n He stood, frowning after her, then stepped onto the veranda as she hiked toward the road. \"Orlando Bloom?\"\\n\\n She simply lifted a hand in a kind of brushing-off wave, and kept walking. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tribute/page-3.html","bookId":2414,"book":{"id":2414,"title":"Tribute","description":"Storyline: Cilla McGowan, a former child star, has found a more satisfying life restoring homes. So she comes to Virginia’s Shenandoah Valley to save the dilapidated farmhouse that once belonged to her grandmother—a legendary actress who died of an overdose more than thirty years ago. \\n Plunging into the project with gusto, Cilla’s almost too busy and exhausted to notice her neighbor, graphic novelist Ford Sawyer. Determined not to carry on the family tradition of ill-fated romances, Cilla steels herself against Ford’s quirky charm, though she can’t help indulging in a little fantasy. \\n But it’s reality that holds its share of dangers for Cilla. A cache of unsigned letters found in the attic points to a mysterious romance in her grandmother’s life—and may be the catalyst for a frightening, violent assault. And if Cilla and Ford are unable to sort out who is targeting her and why, she may, like her world-famous grandmother, be cut down in the prime of her life.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/tribute.jpg","author":"Nora Roberts","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/tribute.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:42 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:35:03 AM"}}
