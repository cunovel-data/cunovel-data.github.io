{"id":7254,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 17","content":"17:1 [hgb] 以 法 莲 山 地 有 一 个 人 名 叫 米 迦 。 \n [kjv] And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah. \n [bbe] Now there was a man of the hill-country of Ephraim named Micah. \n 17:2 [hgb] 他 对 母 亲 说 ， 你 那 一 千 一 百 舍 客 勒 银 子 被 人 拿 去 ， 你 因 此 咒 诅 ， 并 且 告 诉 了 我 。 看 哪 。 这 银 子 在 我 这 里 ， 是 我 拿 去 了 。 他 母 亲 说 ， 我 儿 阿 ， 愿 耶 和 华 赐 福 与 你 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son. \n [bbe] And he said to his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver which were taken from you, about which you took an oath and said in my hearing, I have given this silver to the Lord from my hand for myself, to make a pictured image and a metal image: see, I have the silver, for I took it: so now I will give it back to you. And his mother said, May the blessing of the Lord be on my son. \n 17:3 [hgb] 米 迦 就 把 这 一 千 一 百 舍 客 勒 银 子 还 他 母 亲 。 他 母 亲 说 ， 我 分 出 这 银 子 来 为 你 献 给 耶 和 华 ， 好 雕 刻 一 个 像 ， 铸 成 一 个 像 。 现 在 我 还 是 交 给 你 。 \n [kjv] And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee. \n [bbe] And he gave back the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, and his mother said, I have made the silver holy to the Lord from me for my son, to make a pictured image and a metal image. \n 17:4 [hgb] 米 迦 将 银 子 还 他 母 亲 ， 他 母 亲 将 二 百 舍 客 勒 银 子 交 给 银 匠 ， 雕 刻 一 个 像 ， 铸 成 一 个 像 ， 安 置 在 米 迦 的 屋 内 。 \n [kjv] Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house of Micah. \n [bbe] So he gave the silver back to his mother. Then his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a metal-worker who made a pictured image and a metal image from them: and it was in the house of Micah. \n 17:5 [hgb] 这 米 迦 有 了 神 堂 ， 又 制 造 以 弗 得 和 家 中 的 神 像 ， 分 派 他 一 个 儿 子 作 祭 司 。 \n [kjv] And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest. \n [bbe] And the man Micah had a house of gods; and he made an ephod and family gods and put one of his sons in the position of priest. \n 17:6 [hgb] 那 时 以 色 列 中 没 有 王 ， 各 人 任 意 而 行 。 \n [kjv] In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes. \n [bbe] In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did as seemed right to him. \n 17:7 [hgb] 犹 大 伯 利 恒 有 一 个 少 年 人 ， 是 犹 大 族 的 利 未 人 ， 他 在 那 里 寄 居 。 \n [kjv] And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. \n [bbe] Now there was a young man living in Beth-lehem-judah, of the family of Judah and a Levite, who was not a townsman of the place. \n 17:8 [hgb] 这 人 离 开 犹 大 伯 利 恒 城 ， 要 找 一 个 可 住 的 地 方 。 行 路 的 时 候 ， 到 了 以 法 莲 山 地 ， 走 到 米 迦 的 家 。 \n [kjv] And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed. \n [bbe] And he went away from the town of Beth-lehem-judah, looking for somewhere to make his living-place; and on his journey he came to the hill-country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah. \n 17:9 [hgb] 米 迦 问 他 说 ， 你 从 哪 里 来 。 他 回 答 说 ， 从 犹 大 伯 利 恒 来 。 我 是 利 未 人 ， 要 找 一 个 可 住 的 地 方 。 \n [kjv] And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place. \n [bbe] And Micah said to him, Where do you come from? And he said to him, I am a Levite from Beth-lehem-judah, and I am looking for a living-place. \n 17:10 [hgb] 米 迦 说 ， 你 可 以 住 在 我 这 里 ， 我 以 你 为 父 ， 为 祭 司 。 我 每 年 给 你 十 舍 客 勒 银 子 ， 一 套 衣 服 和 度 日 的 食 物 。 利 未 人 就 进 了 他 的 家 。 \n [kjv] And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in. \n [bbe] Then Micah said to him, Make your living-place with me, and be a father and a priest to me, and I will give you ten shekels of silver a year and your clothing and food. \n 17:11 [hgb] 利 未 人 情 愿 与 那 人 同 住 。 那 人 看 这 少 年 人 如 自 己 的 儿 子 一 样 。 \n [kjv] And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young man was unto him as one of his sons. \n [bbe] And the Levite said he would make his living-place with the man, and he became to him as one of his sons. \n 17:12 [hgb] 米 迦 分 派 这 少 年 的 利 未 人 作 祭 司 ， 他 就 住 在 米 迦 的 家 里 。 \n [kjv] And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. \n [bbe] And Micah gave the position to the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. \n 17:13 [hgb] 米 迦 说 ， 现 在 我 知 道 耶 和 华 必 赐 福 与 我 ， 因 我 有 一 个 利 未 人 作 祭 司 。 \n [kjv] Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good, seeing I have a Levite to my priest. \n [bbe] Then Micah said, Now I am certain that the Lord will do me good, seeing that the Levite has become my priest. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/23/552.html","bookId":237,"book":{"id":237,"title":"Judes士师记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
