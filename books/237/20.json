Then said the children of Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness? \n [bbe] (Now the children of Benjamin had word that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the children of Israel said, Make clear how this evil thing took place. \n 20:4 [hgb] 那 利 未 人 ， 就 是 被 害 之 妇 人 的 丈 夫 ， 回 答 说 ， 我 和 我 的 妾 到 了 便 雅 悯 的 基 比 亚 住 宿 。 \n [kjv] And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge. \n [bbe] Then the Levite, the husband of the dead woman, said in answer, I came to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin, I and my servant-wife, for the purpose of stopping there for the night. \n 20:5 [hgb] 基 比 亚 人 夜 间 起 来 ， 围 了 我 住 的 房 子 ， 想 要 杀 我 ， 又 将 我 的 妾 强 奸 致 死 。 \n [kjv] And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead. \n [bbe] And the townsmen of Gibeah came together against me, going round the house on all sides by night; it was their purpose to put me to death, and my servant-wife was violently used by them and is dead. \n 20:6 [hgb] 我 就 把 我 妾 的 尸 身 切 成 块 子 ， 使 人 拿 着 传 送 以 色 列 得 为 业 的 全 地 ， 因 为 基 比 亚 人 在 以 色 列 中 行 了 凶 淫 丑 恶 的 事 。 \n [kjv] And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel. \n [bbe] So I took her, cutting her into parts which I sent through all the country of the heritage of Israel: for they have done an act of shame in Israel. \n 20:7 [hgb] 你 们 以 色 列 人 都 当 筹 划 商 议 。 \n [kjv] Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and counsel. \n [bbe] Here you all are, you children of Israel; give now your suggestions about what is to be done. \n 20:8 [hgb] 众 民 都 起 来 如 同 一 人 ， 说 ， 我 们 连 一 人 都 不 回 自 己 帐 棚 ， 自 己 房 屋 去 。 \n [kjv] And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house. \n [bbe] Then all the people got up as one man and said, Not one of us will go to his tent or go back to his house: \n 20:9 [hgb] 我 们 向 基 比 亚 人 必 这 样 行 ， 照 所 掣 的 签 去 攻 击 他 们 。 \n [kjv] But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it; \n [bbe] But this is what we will do to Gibeah: we will go up against it by the decision of the Lord; \n 20:10 [hgb] 我 们 要 在 以 色 列 各 支 派 中 ， 一 百 人 挑 取 十 人 ， 一 千 人 挑 取 百 人 ， 一 万 人 挑 取 千 人 ， 为 民 运 粮 ， 等 大 众 到 了 便 雅 悯 的 基 比 亚 ， 就 照 基 比 亚 人 在 以 色 列 中 所 行 的 丑 事 征 伐 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel. \n [bbe] And we will take ten men out of every hundred, through all the tribes of Israel, a hundred out of every thousand, a thousand out of every ten thousand, to get food for the people, so that they may give to Gibeah of Benjamin the right punishment for the act of shame they have done in Israel. \n 20:11 [hgb] 于 是 以 色 列 众 人 彼 此 连 合 如 同 一 人 ， 聚 集 攻 击 那 城 。 \n [kjv] So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man. \n [bbe] So all the men of Israel were banded together against the town, united like one man. \n 20:12 [hgb] 以 色 列 众 支 派 打 发 人 去 ， 问 便 雅 悯 支 派 的 各 家 说 ， 你 们 中 间 怎 么 作 了 这 样 的 恶 事 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you? \n [bbe] And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin saying, What is this evil which has been done among you? \n 20:13 [hgb] 现 在 你 们 要 将 基 比 亚 的 那 些 匪 徒 交 出 来 ， 我 们 好 治 死 他 们 ， 从 以 色 列 中 除 掉 这 恶 。 便 雅 悯 人 却 不 肯 听 从 他 们 弟 兄 以 色 列 人 的 话 。 \n [kjv] Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel: \n [bbe] Now give up those good-for-nothing persons in Gibeah so that we may put them to death, clearing away the evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not give ear to the voice of their brothers, the children of Israel. \n 20:14 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 人 从 他 们 的 各 城 里 出 来 ， 聚 集 到 了 基 比 亚 ， 要 与 以 色 列 人 打 仗 。 \n [kjv] But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of Israel. \n [bbe] And the children of Benjamin came together from all their towns to Gibeah, to go to war with the children of Israel. \n 20:15 [hgb] 那 时 便 雅 悯 人 从 各 城 里 点 出 拿 刀 的 ， 共 有 二 万 六 千 。 另 外 还 有 基 比 亚 人 点 出 七 百 精 兵 。 \n [kjv] And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men. \n [bbe] And the children of Benjamin who came that day from the towns were twenty-six thousand men armed with swords, in addition to the people of Gibeah, numbering seven hundred of the best fighting-men, \n 20:16 [hgb] 在 众 军 之 中 有 拣 选 的 七 百 精 兵 ， 都 是 左 手 便 利 的 ， 能 用 机 弦 甩 石 打 人 ， 毫 发 不 差 。 \n [kjv] Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not miss. \n [bbe] Who were left-handed, able to send a stone at a hair without error. \n 20:17 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 人 之 外 ， 点 出 以 色 列 人 拿 刀 的 ， 共 有 四 十 万 ， 都 是 战 士 。 \n [kjv] And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war. \n [bbe] And the men of Israel, other than Benjamin, were four hundred thousand in number, all armed with swords; they were all men of war. \n 20:18 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 就 起 来 ， 到 伯 特 利 去 求 问 神 说 ， 我 们 中 间 谁 当 首 先 上 去 与 便 雅 悯 人 争 战 呢 ？ 耶 和 华 说 ， 犹 大 当 先 上 去 。 \n [kjv] And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said, Judah shall go up first. \n [bbe] And they got up and went up to Beth-el to get directions from God, and the children of Israel said, Who is to be the first to go up to the fight against the children of Benjamin? And the Lord said, Judah is to go up first. \n 20:19 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 早 晨 起 来 ， 对 着 基 比 亚 安 营 。 \n [kjv] And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped against Gibeah. \n [bbe] So the children of Israel got up in the morning and put themselves in position against Gibeah. \n 20:20 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 出 来 ， 要 与 便 雅 悯 人 打 仗 ， 就 在 基 比 亚 前 摆 阵 。 \n [kjv] And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at Gibeah. \n [bbe] And the men of Israel went out to war against Benjamin (and the men of Israel put their forces in fighting order against them at Gibeah). \n 20:21 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 人 就 从 基 比 亚 出 来 ， 当 日 杀 死 以 色 列 人 二 万 二 千 。 \n [kjv] And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two thousand men. \n [bbe] Then the children of Benjamin came out from Gibeah, cutting down twenty-two thousand of the Israelites that day. \n 20:22 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 彼 此 奋 勇 ， 仍 在 头 一 日 摆 阵 的 地 方 又 摆 阵 。 \n [kjv] And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in array the first day. \n [bbe] But the people, the men of Israel, taking heart again, put their forces in order and took up the same position as on the first day. \n 20:23 [hgb] 未 摆 阵 之 先 ， 以 色 列 人 上 去 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 哭 号 ， 直 到 晚 上 ， 求 问 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 们 再 去 与 我 们 弟 兄 便 雅 悯 人 打 仗 可 以 不 可 以 。 耶 和 华 说 ， 可 以 上 去 攻 击 他 们 。 \n [kjv] (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.) \n [bbe] Now the children of Israel went up, weeping before the Lord till evening, requesting the Lord and saying, Am I to go forward again to the fight against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the Lord said, Go up against him. \n 20:24 [hgb] 第 二 日 ， 以 色 列 人 就 上 前 攻 击 便 雅 悯 人 。 \n [kjv] And the children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin the second day. \n [bbe] So the children of Israel went forward against the children of Benjamin the second day. \n 20:25 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 人 也 在 这 日 从 基 比 亚 出 来 ， 与 以 色 列 人 接 战 ， 又 杀 死 他 们 一 万 八 千 ， 都 是 拿 刀 的 。 \n [kjv] And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword. \n [bbe] And the second day Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah, cutting down eighteen thousand men of the children of Israel, all swordsmen. \n 20:26 [hgb] 以 色 列 众 人 就 上 到 伯 特 利 ， 坐 在 耶 和 华 面 前 哭 号 ， 当 日 禁 食 直 到 晚 上 。 又 在 耶 和 华 面 前 献 燔 祭 和 平 安 祭 。 \n [kjv] Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. \n [bbe] Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up to Beth-el, weeping and waiting there before the Lord, going without food all day till evening, and offering burned offerings and peace-offerings before the Lord. \n 20:27 [hgb] 那 时 ， 神 的 约 柜 在 那 里 。 亚 伦 的 孙 子 ， 以 利 亚 撒 的 儿 子 非 尼 哈 侍 立 在 约 柜 前 。 以 色 列 人 问 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 们 当 再 出 去 与 我 们 弟 兄 便 雅 悯 人 打 仗 呢 ？ 还 是 罢 兵 呢 ？ 耶 和 华 说 ， 你 们 当 上 去 ， 因 为 明 日 我 必 将 他 们 交 在 你 们 手 中 。 \n [kjv] And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days, \n [bbe] And the children of Israel made request to the Lord, (for the ark of the agreement of the Lord was there in those days, \n 20:28 [hgb] \n [kjv] And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand. \n [bbe] And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, was in his place before it,) and said, Am I still to go on with the fight against the children of Benjamin my brother, or am I to give it up? And the Lord said, Go on; for tomorrow I will give him into your hands. \n 20:29 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 在 基 比 亚 的 四 围 设 下 伏 兵 。 \n [kjv] And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah. \n [bbe] So Israel put men secretly all round Gibeah to make a surprise attack on it. \n 20:30 [hgb] 第 三 日 ， 以 色 列 人 又 上 去 攻 击 便 雅 悯 人 ， 在 基 比 亚 前 摆 阵 ， 与 前 两 次 一 样 。 \n [kjv] And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times. \n [bbe] And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in fighting order against Gibeah as before. \n 20:31 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 人 也 出 来 迎 敌 ， 就 被 引 诱 离 城 。 在 田 间 两 条 路 上 ， 一 通 伯 特 利 ， 一 通 基 比 亚 ， 像 前 两 次 ， 动 手 杀 死 以 色 列 人 约 有 三 十 个 。 \n [kjv] And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty men of Israel. \n [bbe] And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, moving away from the town; and as before, at their first attack, they put to death about thirty men of Israel on the highways, of which one goes up to Beth-el and the other to Gibeah, and in the open country. \n 20:32 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 人 说 ， 他 们 仍 旧 败 在 我 们 面 前 。 但 以 色 列 人 说 ， 我 们 不 如 逃 跑 ， 引 诱 他 们 离 开 城 到 路 上 来 。 \n [kjv] And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways. \n [bbe] And the children of Benjamin said, They are giving way before us as at first. But the children of Israel said, Let us go in flight and get them away from the town, into the highways. \n 20:33 [hgb] 以 色 列 众 人 都 起 来 ， 在 巴 力 他 玛 摆 阵 ， 以 色 列 的 伏 兵 从 马 利 迦 巴 埋 伏 的 地 方 冲 上 前 去 。 \n [kjv] And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah. \n [bbe] So all the men of Israel got up and put themselves in fighting order at Baal-tamar: and those who had been waiting secretly to make a surprise attack came rushing out of their place on the west of Geba. \n 20:34 [hgb] 有 以 色 列 人 中 的 一 万 精 兵 ， 来 到 基 比 亚 前 接 战 ， 势 派 甚 是 凶 猛 。 便 雅 悯 人 却 不 知 道 灾 祸 临 近 了 。 \n [kjv] And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near them. \n [bbe] And they came in front of Gibeah, ten thousand of the best men in all Israel, and the fighting became more violent; but the children of Benjamin were not conscious that evil was coming on them. \n 20:35 [hgb] 耶 和 华 使 以 色 列 人 杀 败 便 雅 悯 人 。 那 日 ， 以 色 列 人 杀 死 便 雅 悯 人 二 万 五 千 一 百 ， 都 是 拿 刀 的 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword. \n [bbe] Then the Lord sent sudden fear on Benjamin before Israel; and that day the children of Israel put to death twenty-five thousand, one hundred men of Benjamin, all of them swordsmen. \n 20:36 [hgb] 于 是 便 雅 悯 人 知 道 自 己 败 了 。 先 是 以 色 列 人 。 因 为 靠 着 在 基 比 亚 前 所 设 的 伏 兵 ， 就 在 便 雅 悯 人 面 前 诈 败 。 \n [kjv] So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah. \n [bbe] So the children of Benjamin saw that they were overcome: and the men of Israel had given way before Benjamin, putting their faith in the watchers who were to make the surprise attack on Gibeah. \n 20:37 [hgb] 伏 兵 急 忙 闯 进 基 比 亚 ， 用 刀 杀 死 全 城 的 人 。 \n [kjv] And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the edge of the sword. \n [bbe] And the watchers, rushing on Gibeah and overrunning it, put all the town to the sword without mercy. \n 20:38 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 预 先 同 伏 兵 约 定 在 城 内 放 火 ， 以 烟 气 上 腾 为 号 。 \n [kjv] Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise up out of the city. \n [bbe] Now the sign fixed between the men of Israel and those making the surprise attack was that when they made a pillar of smoke go up from the town, \n 20:39 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 临 退 阵 的 时 候 ， 便 雅 悯 人 动 手 杀 死 以 色 列 人 ， 约 有 三 十 个 ， 就 说 ， 他 们 仍 像 前 次 被 我 们 杀 败 了 。 \n [kjv] And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle. \n [bbe] The men of Israel were to make a turn about in the fight. And Benjamin had overcome and put to death about thirty of the men of Israel, and were saying, Certainly they are falling back before us as in the first fight. \n 20:40 [hgb] 当 烟 气 如 柱 从 城 中 上 腾 的 时 候 ， 便 雅 悯 人 回 头 观 看 ， 见 全 城 的 烟 气 冲 天 。 \n [kjv] But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven. \n [bbe] Then the sign went up out of the town in the pillar of smoke, and the Benjamites, turning back, saw all the town going up in smoke to heaven. \n 20:41 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 又 转 身 回 来 ， 便 雅 悯 人 就 甚 惊 惶 ， 因 为 看 见 灾 祸 临 到 自 己 了 。 \n [kjv] And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them. \n [bbe] And the men of Israel had made a turn about, and the men of Benjamin were overcome with fear, for they saw that evil had overtaken them. \n 20:42 [hgb] 他 们 在 以 色 列 人 面 前 转 身 往 旷 野 逃 跑 。 以 色 列 人 在 后 面 追 杀 。 那 从 各 城 里 出 来 的 ， 也 都 夹 攻 杀 灭 他 们 。 \n [kjv] Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them. \n [bbe] So turning their backs on the men of Israel, they went in the direction of the waste land; but the fight overtook them; and those who came out of the town were heading them off and putting them to the sword. \n 20:43 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 围 绕 便 雅 悯 人 ， 追 赶 他 们 ， 在 他 们 歇 脚 之 处 ， 对 着 日 出 之 地 的 基 比 亚 践 踏 他 们 。 \n [kjv] Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising. \n [bbe] And crushing Benjamin down, they went after them, driving them from Nohah as far as the east side of Gibeah. \n 20:44 [hgb] 便 雅 悯 人 死 了 的 有 一 万 八 千 ， 都 是 勇 士 。 \n [kjv] And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour. \n [bbe] Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin came to their death, all strong men of war. \n 20:45 [hgb] 其 余 的 人 转 身 向 旷 野 逃 跑 ， 往 临 门 磐 去 。 以 色 列 人 在 道 路 上 杀 了 他 们 五 千 人 ， 如 拾 取 遗 穗 一 样 ， 追 到 基 顿 又 杀 了 他 们 二 千 人 。 \n [kjv] And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them. \n [bbe] And turning, they went in flight to the rock of Rimmon in the waste land: and on the highways five thousand of them were cut off by the men of Israel, who, pushing on hard after them to Geba, put to death two thousand more. \n 20:46 [hgb] 那 日 便 雅 悯 死 了 的 共 有 二 万 五 千 人 ， 都 是 拿 刀 的 勇 士 。 \n [kjv] So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour. \n [bbe] So twenty-five thousand of the swordsmen of Benjamin came to their end that day, all strong men of war. \n 20:47 [hgb] 只 剩 下 六 百 人 ， 转 身 向 旷 野 逃 跑 ， 到 了 临 门 磐 ， 就 在 那 里 住 了 四 个 月 。 \n [kjv] But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months. \n [bbe] But six hundred men, turning back, went in flight to the rock of Rimmon in the waste land, and were living on the rock of Rimmon for four months. \n 20:48 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 又 转 到 便 雅 悯 地 ， 将 各 城 的 人 和 牲 畜 ， 并 一 切 所 遇 见 的 ， 都 用 刀 杀 尽 ， 又 放 火 烧 了 一 切 城 邑 。 \n [kjv] And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to. \n [bbe] And the men of Israel, turning again against the children of Benjamin, put to the sword without mercy all the towns and the cattle and everything there was, burning every town which came into their hands. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/23/555.html","bookId":237,"book":{"id":237,"title":"Judes士师记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
