Now we will put your house on fire over you. \n 12:2 [hgb] 耶 弗 他 对 他 们 说 ， 我 和 我 的 民 与 亚 扪 人 大 大 争 战 。 我 招 你 们 来 ， 你 们 竟 没 有 来 救 我 脱 离 他 们 的 手 。 \n [kjv] And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not out of their hands. \n [bbe] And Jephthah said to them, I and my people were in danger, and the children of Ammon were very cruel to us, and when I sent for you, you gave me no help against them. \n 12:3 [hgb] 我 见 你 们 不 来 救 我 ， 我 就 拚 命 前 去 攻 击 亚 扪 人 ， 耶 和 华 将 他 们 交 在 我 手 中 。 你 们 今 日 为 什 么 上 我 这 里 来 攻 打 我 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me this day, to fight against me? \n [bbe] So when I saw that there was no help to be had from you, I put my life in my hand and went over against the children of Ammon, and the Lord gave them into my hands: why then have you come up to me this day to make war on me? \n 12:4 [hgb] 于 是 耶 弗 他 招 聚 基 列 人 ， 与 以 法 莲 人 争 战 。 基 列 人 击 杀 以 法 莲 人 ， 是 因 他 们 说 ， 你 们 基 列 人 在 以 法 莲 ， 玛 拿 西 中 间 ， 不 过 是 以 法 莲 逃 亡 的 人 。 \n [kjv] Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites. \n [bbe] Then Jephthah got together all the men of Gilead and made war on Ephraim; and the men of Gilead overcame Ephraim. \n 12:5 [hgb] 基 列 人 把 守 约 旦 河 的 渡 口 ， 不 容 以 法 莲 人 过 去 。 以 法 莲 逃 走 的 人 若 说 ， 容 我 过 去 。 基 列 人 就 问 他 说 ， 你 是 以 法 莲 人 不 是 。 他 若 说 ， 不 是 ， \n [kjv] And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay; \n [bbe] And the Gileadites took the crossing-places of Jordan against the Ephraimites; and when any of the men of Ephraim who had gone in flight said, let me go over; the men of Gilead said to him, Are you an Ephraimite? And if he said, No; \n 12:6 [hgb] 就 对 他 说 ， 你 说 示 播 列 。 。 以 法 莲 人 因 为 咬 不 真 字 音 ， 便 说 西 播 列 。 基 列 人 就 将 他 拿 住 ， 杀 在 约 旦 河 的 渡 口 。 那 时 以 法 莲 人 被 杀 的 有 四 万 二 千 人 。 \n [kjv] Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two thousand. \n [bbe] Then they said to him, Now say Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth, and was not able to say it in the right way; then they took him and put him to death at the crossing-places of Jordan; and at that time forty-two thousand Ephraimites were put to death. \n 12:7 [hgb] 耶 弗 他 作 以 色 列 的 士 师 六 年 。 基 列 人 耶 弗 他 死 了 ， 葬 在 基 列 的 一 座 城 里 。 \n [kjv] And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead. \n [bbe] Now Jephthah was judge of Israel for six years. And Jephthah the Gileadite came to his death, and his body was put to rest in his town, Mizpeh of Gilead. \n 12:8 [hgb] 耶 弗 他 以 后 ， 有 伯 利 恒 人 以 比 赞 作 以 色 列 的 士 师 。 \n [kjv] And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. \n [bbe] And after him, Ibzan of Beth-lehem was judge of Israel. \n 12:9 [hgb] 他 有 三 十 个 儿 子 ， 三 十 个 女 儿 。 女 儿 都 嫁 出 去 了 。 他 给 众 子 从 外 乡 娶 了 三 十 个 媳 妇 。 他 作 以 色 列 的 士 师 七 年 。 \n [kjv] And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. \n [bbe] He had thirty sons, and thirty daughters whom he sent to other places, and he got thirty wives from other places for his sons. And he was judge of Israel for seven years. \n 12:10 [hgb] 以 比 赞 死 了 ， 葬 在 伯 利 恒 。 \n [kjv] Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem. \n [bbe] And Ibzan came to his death and his body was put to rest at Beth-lehem. \n 12:11 [hgb] 以 比 赞 之 后 ， 有 西 布 伦 人 以 伦 ， 作 以 色 列 的 士 师 十 年 。 \n [kjv] And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged Israel ten years. \n [bbe] And after him, Elon the Zebulonite was judge of Israel; and he was judge of Israel for ten years. \n 12:12 [hgb] 西 布 伦 人 以 伦 死 了 ， 葬 在 西 布 伦 地 的 亚 雅 仑 。 \n [kjv] And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun. \n [bbe] And Elon the Zebulonite came to his death, and his body was put to rest in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. \n 12:13 [hgb] 以 伦 之 后 ， 有 比 拉 顿 人 希 列 的 儿 子 押 顿 作 以 色 列 的 士 师 。 \n [kjv] And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel. \n [bbe] And after him, Abdon, the son of Hillel, the Pirathonite, was judge of Israel. \n 12:14 [hgb] 他 有 四 十 个 儿 子 ， 三 十 个 孙 子 ， 骑 着 七 十 匹 驴 驹 。 押 顿 作 以 色 列 的 士 师 八 年 。 \n [kjv] And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years. \n [bbe] He had forty sons and thirty sons\u0027 sons who went on seventy young asses; and he was judge of Israel for eight years. \n 12:15 [hgb] 比 拉 顿 人 希 列 的 儿 子 押 顿 死 了 ， 葬 在 以 法 莲 地 的 比 拉 顿 ， 在 亚 玛 力 人 的 山 地 。 \n [kjv] And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites. \n [bbe] And Abdon, the son of Hillel, came to his death, and his body was put to rest in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill-country of the Amalekites. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/23/547.html","bookId":237,"book":{"id":237,"title":"Judes士师记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
