and the Lord gave them up into the hand of Midian for seven years. \n 6:2 [hgb] 米 甸 人 压 制 以 色 列 人 。 以 色 列 人 因 为 米 甸 人 ， 就 在 山 中 挖 穴 ， 挖 洞 ， 建 造 营 寨 。 \n [kjv] And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds. \n [bbe] And Midian was stronger than Israel; and because of the Midianites, the children of Israel made holes for themselves in the mountains, and hollows in the rocks, and strong places. \n 6:3 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 每 逢 撒 种 之 后 ， 米 甸 人 ， 亚 玛 力 人 ， 和 东 方 人 都 上 来 攻 打 他 们 ， \n [kjv] And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them; \n [bbe] And whenever Israel\u0027s grain was planted, the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the east came up against them; \n 6:4 [hgb] 对 着 他 们 安 营 ， 毁 坏 土 产 ， 直 到 迦 萨 ， 没 有 给 以 色 列 人 留 下 食 物 ， 牛 ， 羊 ， 驴 也 没 有 留 下 。 \n [kjv] And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass. \n [bbe] And put their army in position against them; and they took all the produce of the earth as far as Gaza, till there was no food in Israel, or any sheep or oxen or asses. \n 6:5 [hgb] 因 为 那 些 人 带 着 牲 畜 帐 棚 来 ， 像 蝗 虫 那 样 多 ， 人 和 骆 驼 无 数 ， 都 进 入 国 内 ， 毁 坏 全 地 。 \n [kjv] For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it. \n [bbe] For they came up regularly with their oxen and their tents; they came like the locusts in number; they and their camels were without number; and they came into the land for its destruction. \n 6:6 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 因 米 甸 人 的 缘 故 ， 极 其 穷 乏 ， 就 呼 求 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD. \n [bbe] And Israel was in great need because of Midian; and the cry of the children of Israel went up to the Lord. \n 6:7 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 因 米 甸 人 的 缘 故 ， 呼 求 耶 和 华 ， \n [kjv] And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD because of the Midianites, \n [bbe] And when the cry of the children of Israel, because of Midian, came before the Lord, \n 6:8 [hgb] 耶 和 华 就 差 遣 先 知 到 以 色 列 人 那 里 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 耶 和 华 以 色 列 的 神 如 此 说 ， 我 曾 领 你 们 从 埃 及 上 来 ， 出 了 为 奴 之 家 ， \n [kjv] That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of bondage; \n [bbe] The Lord sent a prophet to the children of Israel, who said to them, The Lord the God of Israel, has said, I took you up from Egypt, out of the prison-house; \n 6:9 [hgb] 救 你 们 脱 离 埃 及 人 的 手 ， 并 脱 离 一 切 欺 压 你 们 之 人 的 手 ， 把 他 们 从 你 们 面 前 赶 出 ， 将 他 们 的 地 赐 给 你 们 。 \n [kjv] And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from before you, and gave you their land; \n [bbe] And I took you out of the hands of the Egyptians and out of the hands of all who were cruel to you, and I sent them out by force from before you and gave you their land; \n 6:10 [hgb] 又 对 你 们 说 ， 我 是 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 。 你 们 住 在 亚 摩 利 人 的 地 ， 不 可 敬 畏 他 们 的 神 。 你 们 竟 不 听 从 我 的 话 。 \n [kjv] And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice. \n [bbe] And I said to you, I am the Lord your God; you are not to give worship to the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living, but you did not give ear to my voice. \n 6:11 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 使 者 到 了 俄 弗 拉 ， 坐 在 亚 比 以 谢 族 人 约 阿 施 的 橡 树 下 。 约 阿 施 的 儿 子 基 甸 正 在 酒 榨 那 里 打 麦 子 ， 为 要 防 备 米 甸 人 。 \n [kjv] And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the Midianites. \n [bbe] Now the angel of the Lord came and took his seat under the oak-tree in Ophrah, in the field of Joash the Abiezrite; and his son Gideon was crushing grain in the place where the grapes were crushed, so that the Midianites might not see it. \n 6:12 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 使 者 向 基 甸 显 现 ， 对 他 说 ， 大 能 的 勇 士 阿 ， 耶 和 华 与 你 同 在 。 \n [kjv] And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour. \n [bbe] And the angel of the Lord came before his eyes, and said to him, The Lord is with you, O man of war. \n 6:13 [hgb] 基 甸 说 ， 主 阿 ， 耶 和 华 若 与 我 们 同 在 ， 我 们 何 至 遭 遇 这 一 切 事 呢 ？ 我 们 的 列 祖 不 是 向 我 们 说 耶 和 华 领 我 们 从 埃 及 上 来 吗 ？ 他 那 样 奇 妙 的 作 为 在 哪 里 呢 ？ 现 在 他 却 丢 弃 我 们 ， 将 我 们 交 在 米 甸 人 手 里 。 \n [kjv] And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites. \n [bbe] Then Gideon said to him, O my lord, if the Lord is with us why has all this come on us? And where are all his works of power, of which our fathers have given us word, saying, Did not the Lord take us out of Egypt? But now he has given us up, handing us over to the power of Midian. \n 6:14 [hgb] 耶 和 华 观 看 基 甸 ， 说 ， 你 靠 着 你 这 能 力 去 从 米 甸 人 手 里 拯 救 以 色 列 人 ， 不 是 我 差 遣 你 去 的 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I sent thee? \n [bbe] And the Lord, turning to him, said, Go in the strength you have and be Israel\u0027s saviour from Midian: have I not sent you? \n 6:15 [hgb] 基 甸 说 ， 主 阿 ， 我 有 何 能 拯 救 以 色 列 人 呢 ？ 我 家 在 玛 拿 西 支 派 中 是 至 贫 穷 的 。 我 在 我 父 家 是 至 微 小 的 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father\u0027s house. \n [bbe] And he said to him, O Lord, how may I be the saviour of Israel? See, my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father\u0027s house. \n 6:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 他 说 ， 我 与 你 同 在 ， 你 就 必 击 打 米 甸 人 ， 如 击 打 一 人 一 样 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man. \n [bbe] Then the Lord said to him, Truly, I will be with you, and you will overcome the Midianites as if they were one man. \n 6:17 [hgb] 基 甸 说 ， 我 若 在 你 眼 前 蒙 恩 ， 求 你 给 我 一 个 证 据 ， 使 我 知 道 与 我 说 话 的 就 是 主 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me. \n [bbe] So he said to him, If now I have grace in your eyes, then give me a sign that it is you who are talking to me. \n 6:18 [hgb] 求 你 不 要 离 开 这 里 ， 等 我 归 回 将 礼 物 带 来 供 在 你 面 前 。 主 说 ， 我 必 等 你 回 来 。 \n [kjv] Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again. \n [bbe] Do not go away till I come with my offering and put it before you. And he said, I will not go away before you come back. \n 6:19 [hgb] 基 甸 去 预 备 了 一 只 山 羊 羔 ， 用 一 伊 法 细 面 作 了 无 酵 饼 ， 将 肉 放 在 筐 内 ， 把 汤 盛 在 壶 中 ， 带 到 橡 树 下 ， 献 在 使 者 面 前 。 \n [kjv] And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it. \n [bbe] Then Gideon went in and made ready a young goat, and with an ephah of meal he made unleavened cakes: he put the meat in a basket and the soup in which it had been cooked he put in a pot, and he took it out to him under the oak-tree and gave it to him there. \n 6:20 [hgb] 神 的 使 者 吩 咐 基 甸 说 ， 将 肉 和 无 酵 饼 放 在 这 磐 石 上 ， 把 汤 倒 出 来 。 他 就 这 样 行 了 。 \n [kjv] And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth. And he did so. \n [bbe] And the angel of God said to him, Take the meat and the unleavened cakes and put them down on the rock over there, draining out the soup over them. And he did so. \n 6:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 使 者 伸 出 手 内 的 杖 ， 杖 头 挨 了 肉 和 无 酵 饼 ， 就 有 火 从 磐 石 中 出 来 ， 烧 尽 了 肉 和 无 酵 饼 。 耶 和 华 的 使 者 也 就 不 见 了 。 \n [kjv] Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his sight. \n [bbe] Then the angel of the Lord put out the stick which was in his hand, touching the meat and the cakes with the end of it; and a flame came up out of the rock, burning up the meat and the cakes: and the angel of the Lord was seen no longer. \n 6:22 [hgb] 基 甸 见 他 是 耶 和 华 的 使 者 ， 就 说 ， 哀 哉 。 主 耶 和 华 阿 ， 我 不 好 了 ， 因 为 我 觌 面 看 见 耶 和 华 的 使 者 。 \n [kjv] And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD, Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the LORD face to face. \n [bbe] Then Gideon was certain that he was the angel of the Lord; and Gideon said, I am in fear, O Lord God! for I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face. \n 6:23 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 他 说 ， 你 放 心 ， 不 要 惧 怕 ， 你 必 不 至 死 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou shalt not die. \n [bbe] But the Lord said to him, Peace be with you; have no fear: you are in no danger of death. \n 6:24 [hgb] 于 是 基 甸 在 那 里 为 耶 和 华 筑 了 一 座 坛 ， 起 名 叫 耶 和 华 沙 龙 （ 就 是 耶 和 华 赐 平 安 的 意 思 ） 。 这 坛 在 亚 比 以 谢 族 的 俄 弗 拉 直 到 如 今 。 \n [kjv] Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. \n [bbe] Then Gideon made an altar there to the Lord, and gave it the name Yahweh-shalom; to this day it is in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. \n 6:25 [hgb] 当 那 夜 ， 耶 和 华 吩 咐 基 甸 说 ， 你 取 你 父 亲 的 牛 来 ， 就 是 （ 或 作 和 ） 那 七 岁 的 第 二 只 牛 ， 并 拆 毁 你 父 亲 为 巴 力 所 筑 的 坛 ， 砍 下 坛 旁 的 木 偶 ， \n [kjv] And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Take thy father\u0027s young bullock, even the second bullock of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it: \n [bbe] The same night the Lord said to him, Take ten men of your servants and an ox seven years old, and after pulling down the altar of Baal which is your father\u0027s, and cutting down the holy tree by its side, \n 6:26 [hgb] 在 这 磐 石 （ 原 文 作 保 障 ） 上 整 整 齐 齐 地 为 耶 和 华 你 的 神 筑 一 座 坛 ， 将 第 二 只 牛 献 为 燔 祭 ， 用 你 所 砍 下 的 木 偶 作 柴 。 \n [kjv] And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou shalt cut down. \n [bbe] Make an altar to the Lord your God on the top of this rock, in the ordered way and take the ox and make a burned offering with the wood of the holy tree which has been cut down. \n 6:27 [hgb] 基 甸 就 从 他 仆 人 中 挑 了 十 个 人 ， 照 着 耶 和 华 吩 咐 他 的 行 了 。 他 因 怕 父 家 和 本 城 的 人 ， 不 敢 在 白 昼 行 这 事 ， 就 在 夜 间 行 了 。 \n [kjv] Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father\u0027s household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day, that he did it by night. \n [bbe] Then Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the Lord had said to him; but fearing to do it by day, because of his father\u0027s people and the men of the town, he did it by night. \n 6:28 [hgb] 城 里 的 人 清 早 起 来 ， 见 巴 力 的 坛 拆 毁 ， 坛 旁 的 木 偶 砍 下 ， 第 二 只 牛 献 在 新 筑 的 坛 上 ， \n [kjv] And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built. \n [bbe] And the men of the town got up early in the morning, and they saw the altar of Baal broken down, and the holy tree which was by it cut down, and the ox offered on the altar which had been put up there. \n 6:29 [hgb] 就 彼 此 说 ， 这 事 是 谁 作 的 呢 ？ 他 们 访 查 之 后 ， 就 说 ， 这 是 约 阿 施 的 儿 子 基 甸 作 的 。 \n [kjv] And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done this thing. \n [bbe] And they said to one another, Who has done this thing? And after searching with care, they said, Gideon, the son of Joash, has done this thing. \n 6:30 [hgb] 城 里 的 人 对 约 阿 施 说 ， 将 你 儿 子 交 出 来 ， 好 治 死 他 。 因 为 他 拆 毁 了 巴 力 的 坛 ， 砍 下 坛 旁 的 木 偶 。 \n [kjv] Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it. \n [bbe] Then the men of the town said to Joash, Make your son come out to be put to death, for pulling down the altar of Baal and cutting down the holy tree which was by it. \n 6:31 [hgb] 约 阿 施 回 答 站 着 攻 击 他 的 众 人 说 ， 你 们 是 为 巴 力 争 论 吗 ？ 你 们 要 救 他 吗 ？ 谁 为 他 争 论 ， 趁 早 将 谁 治 死 。 巴 力 若 果 是 神 ， 有 人 拆 毁 他 的 坛 ， 让 他 为 自 己 争 论 吧 。 \n [kjv] And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his altar. \n [bbe] But Joash said to all those who were attacking him, Will you take up the cause of Baal? will you be his saviour? Let anyone who will take up his cause be put to death while it is still morning: if he is a god, let him take up his cause himself because of the pulling down of his altar. \n 6:32 [hgb] 所 以 当 日 人 称 基 甸 为 耶 路 巴 力 ， 意 思 说 ， 他 拆 毁 巴 力 的 坛 ， 让 巴 力 与 他 争 论 。 \n [kjv] Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar. \n [bbe] So that day he gave him the name of Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal take up his cause against him because his altar has been broken down. \n 6:33 [hgb] 那 时 ， 米 甸 人 ， 亚 玛 力 人 ， 和 东 方 人 都 聚 集 过 河 ， 在 耶 斯 列 平 原 安 营 。 \n [kjv] Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the valley of Jezreel. \n [bbe] Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the east, banding themselves together, went over and put up their tents in the valley of Jezreel. \n 6:34 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 灵 降 在 基 甸 身 上 ， 他 就 吹 角 。 亚 比 以 谢 族 都 聚 集 跟 随 他 。 \n [kjv] But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him. \n [bbe] But the spirit of the Lord came on Gideon; and at the sound of his horn all Abiezer came together after him. \n 6:35 [hgb] 他 打 发 人 走 遍 玛 拿 西 地 ， 玛 拿 西 人 也 聚 集 跟 随 他 。 又 打 发 人 去 见 亚 设 人 ， 西 布 伦 人 ， 拿 弗 他 利 人 ， 他 们 也 都 出 来 与 他 们 会 合 。 \n [kjv] And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them. \n [bbe] And he sent through all Manasseh, and they came after him; and he sent to Asher and Zebulun and Naphtali, and they came up and were joined to the others. \n 6:36 [hgb] 基 甸 对 神 说 ， 你 若 果 照 着 所 说 的 话 ， 借 我 手 拯 救 以 色 列 人 ， \n [kjv] And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said, \n [bbe] Then Gideon said to God, If you are going to give Israel salvation by my hand, as you have said, \n 6:37 [hgb] 我 就 把 一 团 羊 毛 放 在 禾 场 上 ， 若 单 是 羊 毛 上 有 露 水 ， 别 的 地 方 都 是 干 的 ， 我 就 知 道 你 必 照 着 所 说 的 话 ， 借 我 手 拯 救 以 色 列 人 。 \n [kjv] Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast said. \n [bbe] See, I will put the wool of a sheep on the grain-floor; if there is dew on the wool only, while all the earth is dry, then I will be certain that it is your purpose to give Israel salvation by my hand as you have said. \n 6:38 [hgb] 次 日 早 晨 基 甸 起 来 ， 见 果 然 是 这 样 。 将 羊 毛 挤 一 挤 ， 从 羊 毛 中 拧 出 满 盆 的 露 水 来 。 \n [kjv] And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of water. \n [bbe] And it was so: for he got up early on the morning after, and twisting the wool in his hands, he got a basin full of water from the dew on the wool. \n 6:39 [hgb] 基 甸 又 对 神 说 ， 求 你 不 要 向 我 发 怒 ， 我 再 说 这 一 次 ， 让 我 将 羊 毛 再 试 一 次 。 但 愿 羊 毛 是 干 的 ， 别 的 地 方 都 有 露 水 。 \n [kjv] And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew. \n [bbe] Then Gideon said to God, Do not be moved to wrath against me if I say only this: let me make one more test with the wool; let the wool now be dry, while the earth is covered with dew. \n 6:40 [hgb] 这 夜 神 也 如 此 行 ， 独 羊 毛 上 是 干 的 ， 别 的 地 方 都 有 露 水 。 \n [kjv] And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground. \n [bbe] And that night God did so; for the wool was dry, and there was dew on all the earth round it. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/23/330.html","bookId":237,"book":{"id":237,"title":"Judes士师记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
