And there returned of the people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten thousand. \\n\\n [bbe] So now, let it be given out to the people that anyone who is shaking with fear is to go back from Mount Galud. So twenty-two thousand of the people went back, but there were still ten thousand. \\n\\n 7:4 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 基 甸 说 ， 人 还 是 过 多 。 你 要 带 他 们 下 到 水 旁 ， 我 好 在 那 里 为 你 试 试 他 们 。 我 指 点 谁 说 ， 这 人 可 以 同 你 去 ， 他 就 可 以 同 你 去 。 我 指 点 谁 说 ， 这 人 不 可 同 你 去 ， 他 就 不 可 同 你 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the same shall not go. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the Lord said to Gideon, There are still more people than is necessary; take them down to the water so that I may put them to the test for you there; then whoever I say is to go with you will go, and whoever I say is not to go will not go. \\n\\n 7:5 [hgb] 基 甸 就 带 他 们 下 到 水 旁 。 耶 和 华 对 基 甸 说 ， 凡 用 舌 头 舔 水 ， 像 狗 舔 的 ， 要 使 他 单 站 在 一 处 。 凡 跪 下 喝 水 的 ， 也 要 使 他 单 站 在 一 处 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink. \\n\\n [bbe] So he took the people down to the water; and the Lord said to Gideon, Put on one side by themselves all those drinking up the water with their tongues like a dog; and in the same way, all those who go down on their knees to the water while drinking. \\n\\n 7:6 [hgb] 于 是 用 手 捧 着 舔 水 的 有 三 百 人 ， 其 余 的 都 跪 下 喝 水 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink water. \\n\\n [bbe] Now the number of those who took up the water with their tongues was three hundred; all the rest of the people went down on their knees to the water. \\n\\n 7:7 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 基 甸 说 ， 我 要 用 这 舔 水 的 三 百 人 拯 救 你 们 ， 将 米 甸 人 交 在 你 手 中 。 其 余 的 人 都 可 以 各 归 各 处 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his place. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord said to Gideon, By those three hundred who were drinking with their tongues I will give you salvation and give the Midianites into your hands; let the rest of the people go away, every man to his place. \\n\\n 7:8 [hgb] 这 三 百 人 就 带 着 食 物 和 角 。 其 余 的 以 色 列 人 ， 基 甸 都 打 发 他 们 各 归 各 的 帐 棚 ， 只 留 下 这 三 百 人 。 米 甸 营 在 他 下 边 的 平 原 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the valley. \\n\\n [bbe] So they took the vessels of the people, and their horns from their hands, and he sent them away, every man to his tent, keeping only the three hundred; and the tents of Midian were lower down in the valley. \\n\\n 7:9 [hgb] 当 那 夜 ， 耶 和 华 吩 咐 基 甸 说 ， 起 来 ， 下 到 米 甸 营 里 去 ， 因 我 已 将 他 们 交 在 你 手 中 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine hand. \\n\\n [bbe] The same night the Lord said to him, Up! go down now against their army, for I have given them into your hands. \\n\\n 7:10 [hgb] 倘 若 你 怕 下 去 ， 就 带 你 的 仆 人 普 拉 下 到 那 营 里 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down to the host: \\n\\n [bbe] But if you have fear of going down, take your servant Purah with you and go down to the tents; \\n\\n 7:11 [hgb] 你 必 听 见 他 们 所 说 的 ， 然 后 你 就 有 胆 量 下 去 攻 营 。 于 是 基 甸 带 着 仆 人 普 拉 下 到 营 旁 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the host. \\n\\n [bbe] And after hearing what they are saying, you will get strength to go down against the army. So he went down with his servant Purah to the outer line of the tents of the armed men. \\n\\n 7:12 [hgb] 米 甸 人 ， 亚 玛 力 人 ， 和 一 切 东 方 人 都 布 散 在 平 原 ， 如 同 蝗 虫 那 样 多 。 他 们 的 骆 驼 无 数 ， 多 如 海 边 的 沙 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude. \\n\\n [bbe] Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the people of the east were covering the valley like locusts; and their camels were like the sand by the seaside, without number. \\n\\n 7:13 [hgb] 基 甸 到 了 ， 就 听 见 一 人 将 梦 告 诉 同 伴 说 ， 我 作 了 一 梦 ， 梦 见 一 个 大 麦 饼 滚 入 米 甸 营 中 ， 到 了 帐 幕 ， 将 帐 幕 撞 倒 ， 帐 幕 就 翻 转 倾 覆 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along. \\n\\n [bbe] When Gideon came there, a man was giving his friend an account of his dream, saying, See, I had a dream about a cake of barley bread which, falling into the tents of Midian, came on to the tent, overturning it so that it was stretched out flat on the earth. \\n\\n 7:14 [hgb] 那 同 伴 说 ， 这 不 是 别 的 ， 乃 是 以 色 列 人 约 阿 施 的 儿 子 基 甸 的 刀 。 神 已 将 米 甸 和 全 军 都 交 在 他 的 手 中 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host. \\n\\n [bbe] And his friend in answer said, This is certainly the sword of Gideon, the son of Joash, the men of Israel: into their hands God has given up all the army of Midian. \\n\\n 7:15 [hgb] 基 甸 听 见 这 梦 和 梦 的 讲 解 ， 就 敬 拜 神 ， 回 到 以 色 列 营 中 ， 说 ， 起 来 吧 。 耶 和 华 已 将 米 甸 的 军 队 交 在 你 们 手 中 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Gideon, hearing the story of the dream and the sense in which they took it, gave worship; then he went back to the tents of Israel, and said, Up! for the Lord has given the army of Midian into your hands. \\n\\n 7:16 [hgb] 于 是 基 甸 将 三 百 人 分 作 三 队 ， 把 角 和 空 瓶 交 在 各 人 手 里 ， 瓶 内 都 藏 着 火 把 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet in every man\u0027s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers. \\n\\n [bbe] Then separating the three hundred men into three bands, he gave every man a horn, and a vessel in which was a flaming branch. \\n\\n 7:17 [hgb] 吩 咐 他 们 说 ， 你 们 要 看 我 行 事 ， 我 到 了 营 的 旁 边 怎 样 行 ， 你 们 也 要 怎 样 行 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall ye do. \\n\\n [bbe] And he said to them, Keep your eyes on me, and do what I do; when I come to the outer line of tents, whatever I do, you are to do the same. \\n\\n 7:18 [hgb] 我 和 一 切 跟 随 我 的 人 吹 角 的 时 候 ， 你 们 也 要 在 营 的 四 围 吹 角 ， 喊 叫 说 ， 耶 和 华 和 基 甸 的 刀 。 \\n\\n [kjv] When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon. \\n\\n [bbe] At the sound of my horn, and the horns of those who are with me, let your horns be sounded all round the tents, and say, For the Lord and for Gideon. \\n\\n 7:19 [hgb] 基 甸 和 跟 随 他 的 一 百 人 ， 在 三 更 之 初 才 换 更 的 时 候 ， 来 到 营 旁 ， 就 吹 角 ， 打 破 手 中 的 瓶 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands. \\n\\n [bbe] So Gideon and the three hundred men who were with him came to the outer line of tents, at the start of the middle watch, when the watchmen had only then taken their stations; and the horns were sounded and the vessels broken. \\n\\n 7:20 [hgb] 三 队 的 人 就 都 吹 角 ， 打 破 瓶 子 ， 左 手 拿 着 火 把 ， 右 手 拿 着 角 ， 喊 叫 说 ， 耶 和 华 和 基 甸 的 刀 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon. \\n\\n [bbe] So the three bands all gave a loud note on their horns, and when the vessels had been broken, they took the flaming branches in their left hands, and the horns in their right hands ready for blowing, crying out, For the Lord and for Gideon. \\n\\n 7:21 [hgb] 他 们 在 营 的 四 围 各 站 各 的 地 方 。 全 营 的 人 都 乱 窜 。 三 百 人 呐 喊 ， 使 他 们 逃 跑 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran, and cried, and fled. \\n\\n [bbe] Then they made a line round the tents, every man in his place; and all the army, awaking from sleep, came running out, and with loud cries went in flight. \\n\\n 7:22 [hgb] 三 百 人 就 吹 角 ， 耶 和 华 使 全 营 的 人 用 刀 互 相 击 杀 ， 逃 到 西 利 拉 的 伯 哈 示 他 ， 直 逃 到 靠 近 他 巴 的 亚 伯 米 何 拉 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every man\u0027s sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath. \\n\\n [bbe] And the three hundred gave a loud note on their horns, and every man\u0027s sword was turned by the Lord against his brother all through the army; and the army went in flight as far as Beth-shittah in the direction of Zeredah, to the edge of Abel-meholah by Tabbath. \\n\\n 7:23 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 就 从 拿 弗 他 利 ， 亚 设 ， 和 玛 拿 西 全 地 聚 集 来 追 赶 米 甸 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after the Midianites. \\n\\n [bbe] And the men of Israel came together from Naphtali and from Asher and all Manasseh, and went after Midian. \\n\\n 7:24 [hgb] 基 甸 打 发 人 走 遍 以 法 莲 山 地 ， 说 ， 你 们 下 来 攻 击 米 甸 人 ， 争 先 把 守 约 旦 河 的 渡 口 ， 直 到 伯 巴 拉 。 于 是 以 法 莲 的 众 人 聚 集 ， 把 守 约 旦 河 的 渡 口 ， 直 到 伯 巴 拉 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Gideon sent through all the hill-country of Ephraim saying, Come down against Midian, and keep the ways across Jordan before they come. So all the men of Ephraim, massing themselves together, kept the ways across Jordan. \\n\\n 7:25 [hgb] 捉 住 了 米 甸 人 的 两 个 首 领 ， 一 名 俄 立 ， 一 名 西 伊 伯 。 将 俄 立 杀 在 俄 立 磐 石 上 ， 将 西 伊 伯 杀 在 西 伊 伯 酒 榨 那 里 。 又 追 赶 米 甸 人 ， 将 俄 立 和 西 伊 伯 的 首 级 带 过 约 旦 河 ， 到 基 甸 那 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan. \\n\\n [bbe] And they took the two chiefs of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they put Oreb to death at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they put to death at the place of the grape-crushing in Zeeb, and they went after Midian; but the heads of Oreb and Zeeb they took across Jordan to Gideon. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/23/542.html","bookId":237,"book":{"id":237,"title":"Judes士师记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
