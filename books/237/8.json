{"id":7245,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"8:1 [hgb] 以 法 莲 人 对 基 甸 说 ， 你 去 与 米 甸 人 争 战 ， 没 有 招 我 们 同 去 ， 为 什 么 这 样 待 我 们 呢 ？ 他 们 就 与 基 甸 大 大 地 争 吵 。 \n [kjv] And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply. \n [bbe] And the men of Ephraim came and said to him, Why did you not send for us when you went to war against Midian? And they said sharp and angry words to him. \n 8:2 [hgb] 基 甸 对 他 们 说 ， 我 所 行 的 岂 能 比 你 们 所 行 的 呢 ？ 以 法 莲 拾 取 剩 下 的 葡 萄 不 强 过 亚 比 以 谢 所 摘 的 葡 萄 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer? \n [bbe] And he said to them, What have I done in comparison with you? Is not that which Ephraim took up after the grape-cutting better than all the grapes which Abiezer got in from the grape-cutting? \n 8:3 [hgb] 神 已 将 米 甸 人 的 两 个 首 领 俄 立 和 西 伊 伯 交 在 你 们 手 中 。 我 所 行 的 岂 能 比 你 们 所 行 的 呢 ？ 基 甸 说 了 这 话 ， 以 法 莲 人 的 怒 气 就 消 了 。 \n [kjv] God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that. \n [bbe] God has given into your hands the chiefs of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; what have I been able to do in comparison with you? And when he said this, their feeling about him became kinder. \n 8:4 [hgb] 基 甸 和 跟 随 他 的 三 百 人 到 约 旦 河 过 渡 ， 虽 然 疲 乏 ， 还 是 追 赶 。 \n [kjv] And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them. \n [bbe] Then Gideon came to Jordan and went over it with his three hundred, overcome with weariness and in need of food. \n 8:5 [hgb] 基 甸 对 疏 割 人 说 ， 求 你 们 拿 饼 来 给 跟 随 我 的 人 吃 ， 因 为 他 们 疲 乏 了 。 我 们 追 赶 米 甸 人 的 两 个 王 西 巴 和 撒 慕 拿 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian. \n [bbe] And he said to the men of Succoth, Give bread cakes to my people, for they are overcome with weariness, and I am going on after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian. \n 8:6 [hgb] 疏 割 人 的 首 领 回 答 说 ， 西 巴 和 撒 慕 拿 已 经 在 你 手 里 ， 你 使 我 们 将 饼 给 你 的 军 兵 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army? \n [bbe] But the chiefs of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna even now in your hand that we are to give bread to your army? \n 8:7 [hgb] 基 甸 说 ， 耶 和 华 将 西 巴 和 撒 慕 拿 交 在 我 手 之 后 ， 我 就 用 野 地 的 荆 条 和 枳 棘 打 伤 你 们 。 \n [kjv] And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers. \n [bbe] Then Gideon said, Because of this, when the Lord has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hands, I will have you stretched on a bed of thorns of the waste land and on sharp stems, and have you crushed as grain is crushed on a grain-floor. \n 8:8 [hgb] 基 甸 从 那 里 上 到 毗 努 伊 勒 ， 对 那 里 的 人 也 是 这 样 说 。 毗 努 伊 勒 人 也 与 疏 割 人 回 答 他 的 话 一 样 。 \n [kjv] And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him. \n [bbe] So he went up from there to Penuel and made the same request to the men of Penuel; but they gave him the same answer as the men of Succoth had given. \n 8:9 [hgb] 他 向 毗 努 伊 勒 人 说 ， 我 平 平 安 安 回 来 的 时 候 ， 我 必 拆 毁 这 楼 。 \n [kjv] And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower. \n [bbe] So he said to the men of Penuel, When I come back in peace, I will have this tower broken down. \n 8:10 [hgb] 那 时 西 巴 和 撒 慕 拿 ， 并 跟 随 他 们 的 军 队 都 在 加 各 ， 约 有 一 万 五 千 人 ， 就 是 东 方 人 全 军 所 剩 下 的 。 已 经 被 杀 约 有 十 二 万 拿 刀 的 。 \n [kjv] Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword. \n [bbe] Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor and their armies with them, about fifteen thousand men, those of all the army of the children of the east who were still living; for a hundred and twenty thousand of their swordsmen had been put to death. \n 8:11 [hgb] 基 甸 就 由 挪 巴 和 约 比 哈 东 边 ， 从 住 帐 棚 人 的 路 上 去 ， 杀 败 了 米 甸 人 的 军 兵 ， 因 为 他 们 坦 然 无 惧 。 \n [kjv] And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host: for the host was secure. \n [bbe] And Gideon went up by the way used by the people living in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and made an attack on the army when they had no thought of danger. \n 8:12 [hgb] 西 巴 和 撒 慕 拿 逃 跑 。 基 甸 追 赶 他 们 ， 捉 住 米 甸 的 二 王 西 巴 和 撒 慕 拿 ， 惊 散 全 军 。 \n [kjv] And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the host. \n [bbe] And Zebah and Zalmunna went in flight; and he went after them, and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and put all the army to the curse. \n 8:13 [hgb] 约 阿 施 的 儿 子 基 甸 由 希 列 斯 坡 从 阵 上 回 来 ， \n [kjv] And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun was up, \n [bbe] Then Gideon, the son of Joash, went back from the fight: \n 8:14 [hgb] 捉 住 疏 割 的 一 个 少 年 人 ， 问 他 ， 疏 割 的 首 领 长 老 是 谁 。 他 就 将 首 领 长 老 七 十 七 个 人 的 名 字 写 出 来 。 \n [kjv] And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men. \n [bbe] And taking prisoner a young man of the people of Succoth, he got from him, in answer to his questions, a list of the chiefs of Succoth and the responsible men, seventy-seven men. \n 8:15 [hgb] 基 甸 到 了 疏 割 ， 对 那 里 的 人 说 ， 你 们 从 前 讥 诮 我 说 ， 西 巴 和 撒 慕 拿 已 经 在 你 手 里 ， 你 使 我 们 将 饼 给 跟 随 你 的 疲 乏 人 吗 ？ 现 在 西 巴 和 撒 慕 拿 在 这 里 。 \n [kjv] And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary? \n [bbe] So he came to the men of Succoth and said, Here are Zebah and Zalmunna, on account of whom you made sport of me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna even now in your hand, that we are to give bread to your army who are overcome with weariness? \n 8:16 [hgb] 于 是 捉 住 那 城 内 的 长 老 ， 用 野 地 的 荆 条 和 枳 棘 责 打 （ 原 文 作 指 教 ） 疏 割 人 。 \n [kjv] And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth. \n [bbe] Then he took the responsible men of the town and had them crushed on a bed of thorns and sharp stems. \n 8:17 [hgb] 又 拆 了 毗 努 伊 勒 的 楼 ， 杀 了 那 城 里 的 人 。 \n [kjv] And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the city. \n [bbe] And he had the tower of Penuel broken down and the men of the town put to death. \n 8:18 [hgb] 基 甸 问 西 巴 和 撒 慕 拿 说 ， 你 们 在 他 泊 山 所 杀 的 人 是 什 么 样 式 。 回 答 说 ， 他 们 好 象 你 ， 各 人 都 有 王 子 的 样 式 。 \n [kjv] Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the children of a king. \n [bbe] Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, Where are the men whom you put to death at Tabor? And they gave answer, As you are, so were they; every one of them was like a king\u0027s son. \n 8:19 [hgb] 基 甸 说 ， 他 们 是 我 同 母 的 弟 兄 ， 我 指 着 永 生 的 耶 和 华 起 誓 ， 你 们 从 前 若 存 留 他 们 的 性 命 ， 我 如 今 就 不 杀 你 们 了 。 \n [kjv] And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you. \n [bbe] And he said, They were my brothers, my mother\u0027s sons: by the life of the Lord, if you had kept them safe, I would not put you to death. \n 8:20 [hgb] 于 是 对 他 的 长 子 益 帖 说 ， 你 起 来 杀 他 们 。 但 益 帖 因 为 是 童 子 ， 害 怕 ， 不 敢 拔 刀 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth. \n [bbe] Then he said to Jether, his oldest son, Up! Put them to death. But the boy did not take out his sword, fearing because he was still a boy. \n 8:21 [hgb] 西 巴 和 撒 慕 拿 说 ， 你 自 己 起 来 杀 我 们 吧 。 因 为 人 如 何 ， 力 量 也 是 如 何 。 基 甸 就 起 来 ， 杀 了 西 巴 和 撒 慕 拿 ， 夺 获 他 们 骆 驼 项 上 戴 的 月 牙 圈 。 \n [kjv] Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels\u0027 necks. \n [bbe] Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Up! Put an end to us yourself: for you have a man\u0027s strength. Then Gideon got up and put Zebah and Zalmunna to death and took the ornaments which were on their camels\u0027 necks. \n 8:22 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 对 基 甸 说 ， 你 既 救 我 们 脱 离 米 甸 人 的 手 ， 愿 你 和 你 的 儿 孙 管 理 我 们 。 \n [kjv] Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son\u0027s son also: for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian. \n [bbe] Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Be our ruler, you and your son and your son\u0027s son after him; for you have been our saviour from the hands of Midian. \n 8:23 [hgb] 基 甸 说 ， 我 不 管 理 你 们 ， 我 的 儿 子 也 不 管 理 你 们 ， 惟 有 耶 和 华 管 理 你 们 。 \n [kjv] And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you. \n [bbe] But Gideon said to them, I will not be a ruler over you, and my son will not be a ruler over you: it is the Lord who will be ruler over you. \n 8:24 [hgb] 基 甸 又 对 他 们 说 ， 我 有 一 件 事 求 你 们 ， 请 你 们 各 人 将 所 夺 的 耳 环 给 我 。 （ 原 来 仇 敌 是 以 实 玛 利 人 ， 都 是 戴 金 耳 环 的 。 ） \n [kjv] And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.) \n [bbe] Then Gideon said to them, I have a request to make to you; let every man give me the ear-rings he has taken. (For they had gold ear-rings, because they were Ishmaelites.) \n 8:25 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 我 们 情 愿 给 你 。 就 铺 开 一 件 外 衣 ， 各 人 将 所 夺 的 耳 环 丢 在 其 上 。 \n [kjv] And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey. \n [bbe] And they gave answer, We will gladly give them. So they put down a robe, every man dropping into it the ear-rings he had taken. \n 8:26 [hgb] 基 甸 所 要 出 来 的 金 耳 环 重 一 千 七 百 舍 客 勒 金 子 。 此 外 还 有 米 甸 王 所 戴 的 月 环 ， 耳 坠 ， 和 所 穿 的 紫 色 衣 服 ， 并 骆 驼 项 上 的 金 链 子 。 \n [kjv] And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels\u0027 necks. \n [bbe] The weight of the gold ear-rings which he got from them was one thousand, seven hundred shekels of gold; in addition to the moon-ornaments and jewels and the purple robes which were on the kings of Midian, and the chains on their camels\u0027 necks. \n 8:27 [hgb] 基 甸 以 此 制 造 了 一 个 以 弗 得 ， 设 立 在 本 城 俄 弗 拉 。 后 来 以 色 列 人 拜 那 以 弗 得 行 了 邪 淫 。 这 就 作 了 基 甸 和 他 全 家 的 网 罗 。 \n [kjv] And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house. \n [bbe] And Gideon made an ephod from them and put it up in his town Ophrah; and all Israel went after it there and were false to the Lord; and it became a cause of sin to Gideon and his house. \n 8:28 [hgb] 这 样 ， 米 甸 人 被 以 色 列 人 制 伏 了 ， 不 敢 再 抬 头 。 基 甸 还 在 的 日 子 ， 国 中 太 平 四 十 年 。 \n [kjv] Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness forty years in the days of Gideon. \n [bbe] So Midian was broken before the children of Israel and the Midianites never got back their strength. And the land had peace for forty years, in the days of Gideon. \n 8:29 [hgb] 约 阿 施 的 儿 子 耶 路 巴 力 回 去 ， 住 在 自 己 家 里 。 \n [kjv] And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house. \n [bbe] And Jerubbaal, the son of Joash, went back to his house and was living there. \n 8:30 [hgb] 基 甸 有 七 十 个 亲 生 的 儿 子 ， 因 为 他 有 许 多 的 妻 。 \n [kjv] And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for he had many wives. \n [bbe] Gideon had seventy sons, the offspring of his body; for he had a number of wives. \n 8:31 [hgb] 他 的 妾 住 在 示 剑 ， 也 给 他 生 了 一 个 儿 子 。 基 甸 与 他 起 名 叫 亚 比 米 勒 。 \n [kjv] And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son, whose name he called Abimelech. \n [bbe] And the servant-wife he had in Shechem had a son by him, to whom he gave the name Abimelech. \n 8:32 [hgb] 约 阿 施 的 儿 子 基 甸 ， 年 纪 老 迈 而 死 ， 葬 在 亚 比 以 谢 族 的 俄 弗 拉 ， 在 他 父 亲 约 阿 施 的 坟 墓 里 。 \n [kjv] And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. \n [bbe] And Gideon, the son of Joash, came to his end when he was very old, and his body was put in the resting-place of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites. \n 8:33 [hgb] 基 甸 死 后 ， 以 色 列 人 又 去 随 从 诸 巴 力 行 邪 淫 ， 以 巴 力 比 利 土 为 他 们 的 神 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and made Baalberith their god. \n [bbe] And after the death of Gideon, the children of Israel again went after the gods of Canaan and were false to the Lord, and made Baal-berith their god. \n 8:34 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 不 记 念 耶 和 华 他 们 的 神 ， 就 是 拯 救 他 们 脱 离 四 围 仇 敌 之 手 的 ， \n [kjv] And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side: \n [bbe] And the children of Israel did not keep in their minds the Lord their God, who had been their saviour from all their haters on every side; \n 8:35 [hgb] 也 不 照 着 耶 路 巴 力 ， 就 是 基 甸 向 他 们 所 施 的 恩 惠 厚 待 他 的 家 。 \n [kjv] Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto Israel. \n [bbe] And they were not kind to the house of Jerubbaal, that is, Gideon, in reward for all the good he had done to Israel. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/23/543.html","bookId":237,"book":{"id":237,"title":"Judes士师记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
