And he said, I am. \\n\\n [bbe] And Manoah got up and went after his wife, and came up to the man and said to him, Are you the man who was talking to this woman? And he said, I am. \\n\\n 13:12 [hgb] 玛 挪 亚 说 ， 愿 你 的 话 应 验 。 我 们 当 怎 样 待 这 孩 子 ， 他 后 来 当 怎 样 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we order the child, and how shall we do unto him? \\n\\n [bbe] And Manoah said, Now when your words come true, what is to be the rule for the child and what will be his work? \\n\\n 13:13 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 使 者 对 玛 挪 亚 说 ， 我 告 诉 妇 人 的 一 切 事 ， 她 都 当 谨 慎 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her beware. \\n\\n [bbe] And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah, Let the woman take note of what I have said to her. \\n\\n 13:14 [hgb] 葡 萄 树 所 结 的 都 不 可 吃 ， 清 酒 浓 酒 都 不 可 喝 ， 一 切 不 洁 之 物 也 不 可 吃 。 凡 我 所 吩 咐 的 ， 她 都 当 遵 守 。 \\n\\n [kjv] She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe. \\n\\n [bbe] She is to have nothing which comes from the vine for her food, and let her take no wine or strong drink or anything which is unclean; let her take care to do all I have given her orders to do. \\n\\n 13:15 [hgb] 玛 挪 亚 对 耶 和 华 的 使 者 说 ， 求 你 容 我 们 款 留 你 ， 好 为 你 预 备 一 只 山 羊 羔 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee. \\n\\n [bbe] And Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, Now let us keep you while we make ready a young goat for you. \\n\\n 13:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 使 者 对 玛 挪 亚 说 ， 你 虽 然 款 留 我 ， 我 却 不 吃 你 的 食 物 ， 你 若 预 备 燔 祭 就 当 献 与 耶 和 华 。 原 来 玛 挪 亚 不 知 道 他 是 耶 和 华 的 使 者 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that he was an angel of the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah, Though you keep me I will not take of your food; but if you will make a burned offering, let it be offered to the Lord. For it had not come into Manoah\u0027s mind that he was the angel of the Lord. \\n\\n 13:17 [hgb] 玛 挪 亚 对 耶 和 华 的 使 者 说 ， 请 将 你 的 名 告 诉 我 ， 到 你 话 应 验 的 时 候 ， 我 们 好 尊 敬 你 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name, that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour? \\n\\n [bbe] Then Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, What is your name, so that when your words come true we may give you honour? \\n\\n 13:18 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 使 者 对 他 说 ， 你 何 必 问 我 的 名 ， 我 名 是 奇 妙 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my name, seeing it is secret? \\n\\n [bbe] But the angel of the Lord said to him, Why are you questioning me about my name, seeing that it is a wonder? \\n\\n 13:19 [hgb] 玛 挪 亚 将 一 只 山 羊 羔 和 素 祭 在 磐 石 上 献 与 耶 和 华 ， 使 者 行 奇 妙 的 事 。 玛 挪 亚 和 他 的 妻 观 看 ， \\n\\n [kjv] So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and Manoah and his wife looked on. \\n\\n [bbe] So Manoah took the young goat with its meal offering, offering it on the rock to the Lord, who did strange things. \\n\\n 13:20 [hgb] 见 火 焰 从 坛 上 往 上 升 ， 耶 和 华 的 使 者 在 坛 上 的 火 焰 中 也 升 上 去 了 。 玛 挪 亚 和 他 的 妻 看 见 ， 就 俯 伏 于 地 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces to the ground. \\n\\n [bbe] And when the flame went up to heaven from the altar, the angel of the Lord went up in the flame of the altar, while Manoah and his wife were looking on; and they went down on their faces to the earth. \\n\\n 13:21 [hgb] 耶 和 华 的 使 者 不 再 向 玛 挪 亚 和 他 的 妻 显 现 ， 玛 挪 亚 才 知 道 他 是 耶 和 华 的 使 者 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] But the angel of the Lord was seen no more by Manoah and his wife. Then it was clear to Manoah that he was the angel of the Lord. \\n\\n 13:22 [hgb] 玛 挪 亚 对 他 的 妻 说 ， 我 们 必 要 死 ， 因 为 看 见 了 神 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God. \\n\\n [bbe] And Manoah said to his wife, Death will certainly be our fate, for it is a god whom we have seen. \\n\\n 13:23 [hgb] 他 的 妻 却 对 他 说 ， 耶 和 华 若 要 杀 我 们 ， 必 不 从 我 们 手 里 收 纳 燔 祭 和 素 祭 ， 并 不 将 这 一 切 事 指 示 我 们 ， 今 日 也 不 将 这 些 话 告 诉 我 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these. \\n\\n [bbe] But his wife said to him, If the Lord was purposing our death, he would not have taken our burned offering and our meal offering, or have given us such orders about the child. \\n\\n 13:24 [hgb] 后 来 妇 人 生 了 一 个 儿 子 ， 给 他 起 名 叫 参 孙 。 孩 子 长 大 ， 耶 和 华 赐 福 与 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the child grew, and the LORD blessed him. \\n\\n [bbe] So the woman gave birth to a son, and gave him the name Samson; and he became a man and the blessing of the Lord was on him. \\n\\n 13:25 [hgb] 在 玛 哈 尼 但 ， 就 是 琐 拉 和 以 实 陶 中 间 ， 耶 和 华 的 灵 才 感 动 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol. \\n\\n [bbe] And the spirit of the Lord first came on him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/23/548.html","bookId":237,"book":{"id":237,"title":"Judes士师记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
