\\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord said to the children of Israel, Were not the Egyptians and the Amorites and the children of Ammon and the Philistines \\n\\n 10:12 [hgb] 西 顿 人 ， 亚 玛 力 人 ， 马 云 人 也 都 欺 压 你 们 。 你 们 哀 求 我 ， 我 也 拯 救 你 们 脱 离 他 们 的 手 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Zidonians and Amalek and Midian crushing you down, and in answer to your cry did I not give you salvation from their hands? \\n\\n 10:13 [hgb] 你 们 竟 离 弃 我 ， 事 奉 别 神 。 所 以 我 不 再 救 你 们 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will deliver you no more. \\n\\n [bbe] But, for all this, you have given me up and have been servants to other gods: so I will be your saviour no longer. \\n\\n 10:14 [hgb] 你 们 去 哀 求 所 选 择 的 神 。 你 们 遭 遇 急 难 的 时 候 ， 让 他 救 你 们 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your tribulation. \\n\\n [bbe] Go, send up your cry for help to the gods of your selection; let them be your saviours in the time of your trouble. \\n\\n 10:15 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 对 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 们 犯 罪 了 ， 任 凭 你 随 意 待 我 们 吧 。 只 求 你 今 日 拯 救 我 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we pray thee, this day. \\n\\n [bbe] And the children of Israel said to the Lord, We are sinners; do to us whatever seems good to you: only give us salvation this day. \\n\\n 10:16 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 就 除 掉 他 们 中 间 的 外 邦 神 ， 事 奉 耶 和 华 。 耶 和 华 因 以 色 列 人 受 的 苦 难 ， 就 心 中 担 忧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel. \\n\\n [bbe] So they put away the strange gods from among them, and became the Lord\u0027s servants; and his soul was angry because of the sorrows of Israel. \\n\\n 10:17 [hgb] 当 时 亚 扪 人 聚 集 ， 安 营 在 基 列 。 以 色 列 人 也 聚 集 ， 安 营 在 米 斯 巴 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the children of Ammon came together and put their army in position in Gilead. And the children of Israel came together and put their army in position in Mizpah. \\n\\n 10:18 [hgb] 基 列 的 民 和 众 首 领 彼 此 商 议 说 ， 谁 能 先 去 攻 打 亚 扪 人 ， 谁 必 作 基 列 一 切 居 民 的 领 袖 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead. \\n\\n [bbe] And the people of Israel said to one another, Who will be the first to make an attack on the children of Ammon? We will make him head over all Gilead. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/23/545.html","bookId":237,"book":{"id":237,"title":"Judes士师记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
