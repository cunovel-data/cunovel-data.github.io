{"id":7252,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"15:1 [hgb] 过 了 些 日 子 ， 到 割 麦 子 的 时 候 ， 参 孙 带 着 一 只 山 羊 羔 去 看 他 的 妻 ， 说 ， 我 要 进 内 室 见 我 的 妻 。 他 岳 父 不 容 他 进 去 ， \\n\\n [kjv] But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him to go in. \\n\\n [bbe] Now a short time after, at the time of the grain-cutting, Samson, taking with him a young goat, went to see his wife; and he said, I will go in to my wife into the bride\u0027s room. But her father would not let him go in. \\n\\n 15:2 [hgb] 说 ， 我 估 定 你 是 极 其 恨 她 ， 因 此 我 将 她 给 了 你 的 陪 伴 。 她 的 妹 子 不 是 比 她 还 美 丽 吗 ？ 你 可 以 娶 来 代 替 她 吧 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her. \\n\\n [bbe] And her father said, It seemed to me that you had only hate for her; so I gave her to your friend: but is not her younger sister fairer than she? so please take her in place of the other. \\n\\n 15:3 [hgb] 参 孙 说 ， 这 回 我 加 害 于 非 利 士 人 不 算 有 罪 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure. \\n\\n [bbe] Then Samson said to them, This time I will give payment in full to the Philistines, for I am going to do them great evil. \\n\\n 15:4 [hgb] 于 是 参 孙 去 捉 了 三 百 只 狐 狸 （ 或 作 野 狗 ） ， 将 狐 狸 尾 巴 一 对 一 对 地 捆 上 ， 将 火 把 捆 在 两 条 尾 巴 中 间 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst between two tails. \\n\\n [bbe] So Samson went and got three hundred foxes and some sticks of fire-wood; and he put the foxes tail to tail with a stick between every two tails; \\n\\n 15:5 [hgb] 点 着 火 把 ， 就 放 狐 狸 进 入 非 利 士 人 站 着 的 禾 稼 ， 将 堆 集 的 禾 捆 和 未 割 的 禾 稼 ， 并 橄 榄 园 尽 都 烧 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives. \\n\\n [bbe] Then firing the sticks, he let the foxes loose among the uncut grain of the Philistines, and all the corded stems as well as the living grain and the vine-gardens and the olives went up in flames. \\n\\n 15:6 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 说 ， 这 事 是 谁 作 的 呢 ？ 有 人 说 ， 是 亭 拿 人 的 女 婿 参 孙 ， 因 为 他 岳 父 将 他 的 妻 给 了 他 的 陪 伴 。 于 是 非 利 士 人 上 去 ， 用 火 烧 了 妇 人 和 她 的 父 亲 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they said, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took his wife and gave her to his friend. So the Philistines came up and had her and her father\u0027s house burned. \\n\\n 15:7 [hgb] 参 孙 对 非 利 士 人 说 ， 你 们 既 然 这 样 行 ， 我 必 向 你 们 报 仇 才 肯 罢 休 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease. \\n\\n [bbe] And Samson said to them, If you go on like this, truly I will take my full payment from you; and that will be the end of it. \\n\\n 15:8 [hgb] 参 孙 就 大 大 击 杀 他 们 ， 连 腿 带 腰 都 砍 断 了 。 他 便 下 去 ， 住 在 以 坦 磐 的 穴 内 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam. \\n\\n [bbe] And he made an attack on them, driving them in uncontrolled flight, and causing great destruction; then he went away to his safe place in the crack of the rock at Etam. \\n\\n 15:9 [hgb] 非 利 士 人 上 去 安 营 在 犹 大 ， 布 散 在 利 希 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread themselves in Lehi. \\n\\n [bbe] Then the Philistines went and put up their tents in Judah, all round Lehi. \\n\\n 15:10 [hgb] 犹 大 人 说 ， 你 们 为 何 上 来 攻 击 我 们 呢 ？ 他 们 说 ， 我 们 上 来 是 要 捆 绑 参 孙 。 他 向 我 们 怎 样 行 ， 我 们 也 要 向 他 怎 样 行 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath done to us. \\n\\n [bbe] And the men of Judah said, Why have you come up against us? And they said, We have come up to take Samson, and to do to him as he has done to us. \\n\\n 15:11 [hgb] 于 是 有 三 千 犹 大 人 下 到 以 坦 磐 的 穴 内 ， 对 参 孙 说 ， 非 利 士 人 辖 制 我 们 ， 你 不 知 道 吗 ？ 你 向 我 们 行 的 是 什 么 事 呢 ？ 他 回 答 说 ， 他 们 向 我 怎 样 行 ， 我 也 要 向 他 们 怎 样 行 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them. \\n\\n [bbe] Then three thousand of the men of Judah went down to the crack of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Is it not clear to you that the Philistines are our rulers? What is this you have done to us? And he said to them, I only did to them as they did to me. \\n\\n 15:12 [hgb] 犹 大 人 对 他 说 ， 我 们 下 来 是 要 捆 绑 你 ， 将 你 交 在 非 利 士 人 手 中 。 参 孙 说 ， 你 们 要 向 我 起 誓 ， 应 承 你 们 自 己 不 害 死 我 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves. \\n\\n [bbe] Then they said to him, We have come down to take you and give you up into the hands of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Give me your oath that you will not make an attack on me yourselves. \\n\\n 15:13 [hgb] 他 们 说 ， 我 们 断 不 杀 你 ， 只 要 将 你 捆 绑 交 在 非 利 士 人 手 中 。 于 是 用 两 条 新 绳 捆 绑 参 孙 ， 将 他 从 以 坦 磐 带 上 去 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the rock. \\n\\n [bbe] And they said, No; we will take you and give you up into their hands, but truly we will not put you to death. So knotting two new cords round him they took him up from the rock. \\n\\n 15:14 [hgb] 参 孙 到 了 利 希 ， 非 利 士 人 都 迎 着 喧 嚷 。 耶 和 华 的 灵 大 大 感 动 参 孙 ， 他 臂 上 的 绳 就 像 火 烧 的 麻 一 样 ， 他 的 绑 绳 都 从 他 手 上 脱 落 下 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands. \\n\\n [bbe] And when he came to Lehi, the Philistines came out, meeting him with loud cries; then the spirit of the Lord came rushing on him, and the cords on his arms became like grass which has been burned with fire, and the bands came falling off his hands. \\n\\n 15:15 [hgb] 他 见 一 块 未 干 的 驴 腮 骨 ， 就 伸 手 拾 起 来 ， 用 以 击 杀 一 千 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand, and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith. \\n\\n [bbe] And taking up the mouth-bone of an ass newly dead, which he saw by chance on the earth, he put to death a thousand men with it. \\n\\n 15:16 [hgb] 参 孙 说 ， 我 用 驴 腮 骨 杀 人 成 堆 ， 用 驴 腮 骨 杀 了 一 千 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps, with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men. \\n\\n [bbe] And Samson said, With a red ass\u0027s mouth-bone I have made them red with blood, with a red ass\u0027s mouth-bone I have sent destruction on a thousand men. \\n\\n 15:17 [hgb] 说 完 这 话 ， 就 把 那 腮 骨 从 手 里 抛 出 去 了 。 那 地 便 叫 拉 末 利 希 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place Ramathlehi. \\n\\n [bbe] And having said these words, he let the mouth-bone go out of his hand; so that place was named Ramath-lehi. \\n\\n 15:18 [hgb] 参 孙 甚 觉 口 渴 ， 就 求 告 耶 和 华 说 ， 你 既 借 仆 人 的 手 施 行 这 么 大 的 拯 救 ， 岂 可 任 我 渴 死 ， 落 在 未 受 割 礼 的 人 手 中 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised? \\n\\n [bbe] After this, he was in great need of water, and crying out to the Lord, he said, You have given this great salvation by the hand of your servant, and now need of water will be my death; and I will be given into the hands of this people who are without circumcision. \\n\\n 15:19 [hgb] 神 就 使 利 希 的 洼 处 裂 开 ， 有 水 从 其 中 涌 出 来 。 参 孙 喝 了 精 神 复 原 。 因 此 那 泉 名 叫 隐 哈 歌 利 ， 那 泉 直 到 今 日 还 在 利 希 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day. \\n\\n [bbe] Then God made a crack in the hollow rock in Lehi and water came out of it; and after drinking, his spirit came back to him and he was strong again; so that place was named En-hakkore; it is in Lehi to this day. \\n\\n 15:20 [hgb] 当 非 利 士 人 辖 制 以 色 列 人 的 时 候 ， 参 孙 作 以 色 列 的 士 师 二 十 年 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years. \\n\\n [bbe] And he was judge of Israel in the days of the Philistines for twenty years. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/23/550.html","bookId":237,"book":{"id":237,"title":"Judes士师记（双语小说）","description":"简介： Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?
