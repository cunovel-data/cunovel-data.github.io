{"id":744,"no":39,"title":"CHAPTER IX. SLAVES AS THEY ARE, ON TESTIMONY OF OWNERS.","content":"The investigation into the actual condition of the slave population at the South is beset with many difficulties. So many things are said pro and con,—so many said in one connection and denied in another,—that the effect is very confusing. \n \n Thus, we are told that the state of the slaves is one of blissful contentment; that they would not take freedom as a gift; that their family relations are only now and then invaded; that they are a stupid race, almost sunk to the condition of animals; that generally they are kindly treated, \u0026c. \u0026c. \u0026c. \n \n In reading over some two hundred Southern newspapers this fall, the author has been struck with the very graphic and circumstantial pictures, which occur in all of them, 176describing fugitive slaves. From these descriptions one may learn a vast many things. The author will here give an assortment of them, taken at random. It is a commentary on the contented state of the slave population that the writer finds two or three always, and often many more, in every one of the hundreds of Southern papers examined. \n \n In reading the following little sketches of “slaves as they are,” let the reader notice: \n \n 1. The color and complexion of the majority of them. \n \n 2. That it is customary either to describe slaves by some scar, or to say “No scars recollected.” \n \n 3. The intelligence of the parties advertised. \n \n 4. The number that say they are free that are to be sold to pay jail-fees. \n \n Every one of these slaves has a history,—a history of woe and crime, degradation, endurance, and wrong. Let us open the chapter: \n \n South-side Democrat, Oct. 28, 1852. Petersburgh, Virginia: \n REWARD. \n \n Twenty-five dollars, with the payment of all necessary expenses, will be given for the apprehension and delivery of my man CHARLES, if taken on the Appomattox river, or within the precincts of Petersburgh. He ran off about a week ago, and, if he leaves the neighborhood, will no doubt make for Farmville and Petersburgh. He is a mulatto, rather below the medium height and size, but well proportioned, and very active and sensible. He is aged about 27 years, has a mild, submissive look, and will, no doubt, show the marks of a recent whipping, if taken. He must be delivered to the care of Peebles, White, Davis \u0026 Co. \n R. H. DeJarnett, \n Lunenburgh. \n Oct. 25—3t. \n \n Poor Charles!—mulatto!—has a mild, submissive look, and will probably show marks of a recent whipping! \n \n Kosciusko Chronicle, Nov. 24, 1852: \n COMMITTED \n \n To the Jail of Attila County, on the 8th instant, a negro boy, who calls his name GREEN, and says he belongs to James Gray, of Winston County.

Had on when taken up a cotton cheek shirt, Linsey pants, new cloth cap, and was riding a large roan horse about 12 or 14 years old and thin in order.

This boy is 19 years old, a light mulatto with dirty sunburnt hair, inclined to be straight; he is just 5 feet 7 inches high, and slightly made. He had on when he left a black cloth cap, black cloth pantaloons, a plaided sack coat, a fine shirt, and brogan shoes. One hundred dollars will be paid for the recovery of the above-described boy, if taken out of the State, or fifty dollars if taken in the State. \n Mrs. S. P.

E. on the breast, and having both small toes cut off. He is of a very dark complexion, with eyes small but bright, and a look quite insolent. He dresses good, and was arrested as a runaway at Donaldsonville, some three years ago. The above reward will be paid for his arrest, by addressing Messrs. Armant Brothers, St. James parish, or A. Miltenberger \u0026 Co., 30 Carondelet-street.” \n \n Here is a preacher who is branded on the breast and has both toes cut off,—and will look insolent yet! There’s depravity for you! \n \n Jefferson Inquirer, Nov. 27, 1852: \n $100 DOLLARS REWARD. \n \n RANAWAY from my plantation, in Bolivar County, Miss., a negro man named MAY, aged 40 years, 5 feet 10 or 11 inches high, copper colored, and very straight; his front teeth are good and stand a little open; stout through the shoulders, and has some scars on his back that show above the skin plain, caused by the whip; he frequently hiccups when eating, if he has not got water handy; he was pursued into Ozark County, Mo., and there left.

Said woman is about five feet five inches high, has prominent cheek-bones, large mouth and good front teeth, tolerably spare built, about 26 years old. We think it probable she is harbored by some negroes not far from John Mynatt’s, in Knox County, where she and they are likely making some arrangements to get to a free state; or she may be concealed by some negroes (her connections) in Anderson County, near Clinton. I will give the above reward for her apprehension and confinement in any prison in this state, or I will give fifty dollars for her confinement in any jail out of this state, so that I get her. \n H.

Bob is about 5 feet high, will weigh 130 pounds, is about 22 years old, and has some beard on his upper lip. His left leg is somewhat shorter than his right, causing him to hobble in his walk; has a very broad face, and will show color like a white man. It is probable he has gone off with some wagoner or trader, or he may have free papers and be passing as a free man. He has straight hair. \n \n I will give a reward of TWENTY-FIVE DOLLARS for the apprehension and delivery to me of said boy, or for his confinement in any jail, so that I get him again. \n Clara Lockhart, \n By Adam Lockhart \n June 30, 1852. 698: 5 \n \n Southern Standard, Oct. 16, 1852: \n $50 REWARD!!! \n \n RANAWAY, or stolen, from the subscriber, living near Aberdeen, Miss., a light mulatto woman, of small size, and about 23 years old.

Jennings has got a raffle under way now, which eclipses all his previous undertakings in that line. The prizes are the celebrated trotting horse “Star,” buggy and harness, and a valuable negro servant,—the latter valued at nine hundred dollars. See his advertisement in another column. \n \n The advertisement is as follows: \n RAFFLE. \n MR. JOSEPH JENNINGS \n \n Respectfully informs his friends and the public, that, at the request of many of acquaintances, he has been induced to purchase from Mr. Osborn, of Missouri, the celebrated dark bay horse “Star,” age five years, square trotter, and warranted sound, with a new light trotting Buggy and Harness; also the stout mulatto girl “Sarah,” aged about twenty years, general house servant, valued at nine hundred dollars, and guaranteed; will be raffled for at 4 o’clock, P. M., February 1st, at any hotel selected by the subscribers. \n \n The above is as represented, and those persons who may wish to engage in the usual practice of raffling will, I assure them, be perfectly satisfied with their destiny in this affair. \n \n Fifteen hundred chances, at $1 each. \n \n The whole is valued at its just worth, fifteen hundred dollars. \n \n The raffle will be conducted by gentleman selected by the interested subscribers present. Five nights allowed to complete the raffle. Both of above can be seen at my store, No. 78 Commonstreet, second door from Camp, at from 9 o’clock A. M., till half-past 2 P.

Hardy is a remarkably likely negro, entirely free from all marks, scars or blemishes, when he left home; about six feet high, of black complexion (though quite light), fine countenance, unusually smooth skin, good head of hair, fine eyes and teeth. \n \n Address the subscriber at Rifle Point, Concordia Parish, La. \n Robert Y. Jones. \n Oct. 30.—1m. \n \n What an unfortunate master—lost an article entirely free from “marks, scars or blemishes”! Such a rarity ought to be choice! \n \n Savannah Daily Georgian, 6th Sept., 1852: \n ARRESTED. \n \n ABOUT three weeks ago, under suspicious circumstances, a negro woman, who calls herself PHEBE, or PHILLIS. Says she is free, and lately from Beaufort District, South Carolina. Said woman is about 50 years of age, stout in stature, mild-spoken, 5 feet 4 inches high, and weighs about 140 pounds. Having made diligent inquiry by letter, and from what I can learn, said woman is a runaway. Any person owning said slave can get her by making application to me, properly authenticated. \n Waring Russell, \n County Constable. \n Savannah, Oct. 25, 1852. 6 Oct. 26. \n 250 DOLLARS REWARD. \n \n RANAWAY from Sparta, Ga., about the first of last year my boy GEORGE. He is a good carpenter, about 35 years; a bright mulatto, tall and quite likely. He was brought about three years ago from St. Mary’s, and had, when he ran away, a wife there, or near there, belonging to a Mr. Holzendorff. I think he has told me he has been about Macon also. He had, and perhaps still has, a brother in Savannah. He is very intelligent. I will give the above reward for his confinement in some jail in the State, so that I can get him. Refer, for any further information, to Rabun \u0026 Whitehead, Savannah, Ga. \n W. J. Sassnett. \n Oxford, Ga., Aug. 13th, 1852. tuths3m. a17. \n \n From these advertisements, and hundreds of similar ones, one may learn the following things: \n \n 1831. That the arguments for the enslaving of the negro do not apply to a large part of the actual slaves. \n \n 2. That they are not, in the estimation of their masters, very stupid. \n \n 3. That they are not remarkably contented. \n \n 4. That they have no particular reason to be so. \n \n 5. That multitudes of men claiming to be free are constantly being sold into slavery. \n \n In respect to the complexion of these slaves, there are some points worthy of consideration. The writer adds the following advertisements, published by Wm. I. Bowditch, Esq., in his pamphlet “Slavery and the Constitution.” \n \n From the Richmond (Va.) Whig: \n 100 DOLLARS REWARD \n \n WILL be given for the apprehension of my negro (!) Edmund Kenney. He has straight hair, and complexion so nearly white that it is believed a stranger would suppose there was no African blood in him. He was with my boy Dick a short time since in Norfolk, and offered him for sale, and was apprehended, but escaped under pretence of being a white man! \n Anderson Bowles. \n January 6, 1836. \n \n From the Republican Banner and Nashville Whig of July 14, 1849: \n 200 DOLLARS REWARD. \n \n RANAWAY from the subscriber, on the 23d of June last, a bright mulatto woman, named Julia, about 25 years of age. She is of common size, nearly white, and very likely. She is a good seamstress, and can read a little. She may attempt to pass for white,—dresses fine. She took with her Anna, her child, 8 or 9 years old, and considerably darker than her mother.... She once belonged to a Mr. Helm, of Columbia, Tennessee. \n \n I will give a reward of $50 for said negro and child, if delivered to me, or confined in any jail in this state, so I can get them; $100, if caught in any other Slave state, and confined in a jail so that I can get them; and $200, if caught in any Free state, and put in any good jail in Kentucky or Tennessee, so I can get them. \n A. W. Johnson. \n Nashville, July 9, 1849. \n \n The following three advertisements are taken from Alabama papers: \n RANAWAY \n \n From the Subscriber, working on the plantation of Col. H. Tinker, a bright mulatto boy, named Alfred. Alfred is about 18 years old, pretty well grown, has blue eyes, light flaxen hair, skin disposed to freckle. He will try to pass as free-born. \n Green County, Ala. \n S. G. Stewart. \n 100 DOLLARS REWARD. \n \n Ran away from the subscriber, a bright mulatto man-slave, named Sam. Light, sandy hair, blue eyes, ruddy complexion,—is so white as very easily to pass for a free white man. \n Edwin Peck. \n Mobile, April 22, 1837. \n RANAWAY. \n \n On the 15th of May, from me, a negro woman, named Fanny. Said woman is 20 years old; is rather tall; can read and write, and so forge passes for herself. Carried away with her a pair of ear-rings,—a Bible with a red cover; is very pious. She prays a great deal, and was, as supposed, contented and happy. She is as white as most white women, with straight, light hair, and blue eyes, and can pass herself for a white woman. I will give $500 for her apprehension and delivery to me. She is very intelligent. \n Tuscaloosa, May 29, 1845. \n John Balch. \n \n From the Newbern (N. C.) Spectator: \n 50 DOLLARS REWARD \n \n Will be given for the apprehension and delivery to me of the following slaves:—Samuel, and Judy his wife, with their four children, belonging to the estate of Sacker Dubberly, deceased. \n \n I will give $10 for the apprehension of William Dubberly, a slave belonging to the estate. William is about 19 years old, quite white, and would not readily be taken for a slave. \n John J. Lane. \n March 13, 1837. \n \n The next two advertisements we cut from the New Orleans Picayune of Sept. 2, 1846: \n 25 DOLLARS REWARD. \n \n Ranaway from the plantation of Madame Fergus Duplantier, on or about the 27th of June, 1846, a bright mulatto, named Ned, very stout built, about 5 feet 11 inches high, speaks English and French, about 35 years old, waddles in his walk. He may try to pass himself for a white man, as he is of a very clear color, and has sandy hair. The above reward will be paid to whoever will bring him to Madame Duplantier’s plantation, Manchac, or lodge him in some jail where he can be conveniently obtained. \n 200 DOLLARS REWARD. \n \n Ran away from the subscriber, last November, a white negro man, about 35 years old, height about 5 feet 8 or 10 inches, blue eyes, has a yellow woolly head, very fair skin. \n \n These are the characteristics of three races. The copper-colored complexion shows the Indian blood. The others are the mixed races of negroes and whites. It is known that the poor remains of Indian races have been in many cases forced into slavery. It is no less certain that white children have sometimes been kidnapped and sold into slavery. Rev. George Bourne, of Virginia, Presbyterian minister, who wrote against slavery there as early as 1816, gives an account of a boy who was stolen from his parents at seven years of age, immersed in a tan-vat to change his complexion, tattooed and sold, and, after a captivity of fourteen years, succeeded in escaping. The tanning process is not necessary now, as a fair skin is no presumption against slavery. There is reason to think that the grandmother of poor Emily Russell was a white child, stolen by kidnappers. That kidnappers may steal and sell white children at the South now, is evident from these advertisements. \n \n The writer, within a week, has seen a fugitive quadroon mother, who had with her two children,—a boy of ten months, and a girl of three years. Both were surpassingly fair, and uncommonly beautiful. The girl had blue eyes and golden hair. The mother and those children were about to be sold for the division of an estate, which was the reason why she fled. When the mind once becomes familiarized with the process of slavery,—of enslaving first black, then Indian, then mulatto, then quadroon, and when blue eyes and golden hair are advertised as properties of negroes,—what protection will there be for poor white people, especially as under the present fugitive law they can be carried away without a jury trial? \n \n A Governor of South Carolina openly declared, in 1835, that the laboring population of any country, bleached or unbleached, were a dangerous element, unless reduced to slavery. Will not this be the result, then? \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1809/52601.html","bookId":26,"book":{"id":26,"title":"Harriet Beecher Stowe","description":"简介： At different times, doubt has been expressed whether the representations of Uncle Toms Cabin are a fair representation of slavery as it at present exists.
