{"id":739,"no":34,"title":"CHAPTER IV. THE SLAVE-TRADE.","content":"What is it that constitutes the vital force of the institution of slavery in this country? Slavery, being an unnatural and unhealthful condition of society, being a most wasteful and impoverishing mode of cultivating the soil, would speedily run itself out in a community, and become so unprofitable as to fall into disuse, were it not kept alive by some unnatural process. \\n\\n \\n\\n What has that process been in America? Why has that healing course of nature which cured this awful wound in all the northern states stopped short on Mason \u0026 Dixon’s line? In Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and Kentucky, slave labor long ago impoverished the soil almost beyond recovery, and became entirely unprofitable. In all these states it is well known that the question of emancipation has been urgently presented. It has been discussed in legislatures, and Southern men have poured forth on the institution of slavery such anathemas as only Southern men can pour forth. All that has ever been said of it at the North has been said in four-fold thunders in these Southern discussions. The State of Kentucky once came within one vote, in her legislature, of taking measures for gradual emancipation. The State of Virginia has come almost equally near, and Maryland has long been waiting at the door. There was a time when no one doubted that all these states would soon be free states; and what is now the reason that they are not? Why are these discussions now silenced, and why does this noble determination now retrograde? The answer is in a word. It is the extension of slave territory, the opening of a great southern slave-market, and the organization of a great internal slave-trade, that has arrested the progress of emancipation. \\n\\n \\n\\n While these states were beginning to look upon the slave as one who might possibly yet become a man, while they meditated giving to him and his wife and children the inestimable blessings of liberty, this great southern slave-mart was opened. It began by the addition of Missouri as slave territory, and the votes of two Northern men were those which decided this great question. Then, by the assent and concurrence of Northern men, came in all the immense acquisition of slave territory which now opens so boundless a market to tempt the avarice and cupidity of the northern slave-raising states. \\n\\n \\n\\n This acquisition of territory has deferred perhaps for indefinite ages the emancipation of a race. It has condemned to sorrow and 144heart-breaking separation, to groans and wailings, hundreds of thousands of slave families; it has built, through all the Southern States, slave-warehouses, with all their ghastly furnishings of gags, and thumb-screws, and cowhides; it has organized unnumbered slave-coffles, clanking their chains and filing in mournful march through this land of liberty. \\n\\n \\n\\n This accession of slave territory hardened the heart of the master. It changed what was before, in comparison, a kindly relation, into the most horrible and inhuman of trades. \\n\\n \\n\\n The planter whose slaves had grown up around him, and whom he had learned to look upon almost as men and women, saw on every sable forehead now nothing but its market value. This man was a thousand dollars, and this eight hundred. The black baby in its mother’s arms was a hundred-dollar bill, and nothing more. All those nobler traits of mind and heart which should have made the slave a brother became only so many stamps on his merchandise. Is the slave intelligent?—Good! that raises his price two hundred dollars. Is he conscientious and faithful?—Good! stamp it down in his certificate; it’s worth two hundred dollars more. Is he religious? Does that Holy Spirit of God, whose name we mention with reverence and fear, make that despised form His temple?—Let that also be put down in the estimate of his market value, and the gift of the Holy Ghost shall be sold for money. Is he a minister of God?—Nevertheless, he has his price in the market. From the church and from the communion-table the Christian brother and sister are taken to make up the slave-coffle. And woman, with her tenderness, her gentleness, her beauty,—woman, to whom mixed blood of the black and the white have given graces perilous for a slave,—what is her accursed lot, in this dreadful commerce?—The next few chapters will disclose facts on this subject which ought to wring the heart of every Christian mother, if, indeed, she be worthy of that holiest name. \\n\\n \\n\\n But we will not deal in assertions merely. We have stated the thing to be proved; let us show the facts which prove it. \\n\\n \\n\\n The existence of this fearful traffic is known to many,—the particulars and dreadful extent of it realized but by few. \\n\\n \\n\\n Let us enter a little more particularly on them. The slave-exporting states are Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee and Missouri. These are slave-raising states, and the others are slave-consuming states. We have shown, in the preceding chapters, the kind of advertisements which are usual in those states; but, as we wish to produce on the minds of our readers something of the impression which has been produced on our own mind by their multiplicity and abundance, we shall add a few more here.

James. \\n\\n \\n\\n The slave-raising business of the northern states has been variously alluded to and recognized, both in the business statistics of the states, and occasionally in the speeches of patriotic men, who have justly mourned over it as a degradation to their country. In 1841, the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society addressed to the executive committee of the American Anti-Slavery Society some inquiries on the internal American slave-trade. \\n\\n \\n\\n A labored investigation was made at that time, the results of which were published in London; and from that volume are made the following extracts: \\n\\n \\n\\n The Virginia Times (a weekly newspaper, published at Wheeling, Virginia) estimates, in 1836, the number of slaves exported for sale from that state alone, during “the twelve months preceding,” at forty thousand, the aggregate value of whom is computed at twenty-four millions of dollars. \\n\\n \\n\\n Allowing for Virginia one-half of the whole exportation during the period in question, and we have the appalling sum total of eighty thousand slaves exported in a single year from the breeding states. We cannot decide with certainty what proportion of the above number was furnished by each of the breeding states, but Maryland ranks next to Virginia in point of numbers, North Carolina follows Maryland, Kentucky, North Carolina, then Tennessee and Delaware. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Natchez (Mississippi) Courier says “that the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas, imported two hundred and fifty thousand slaves from the more northern states in the year 1836.” \\n\\n \\n\\n This seems absolutely incredible, but it probably includes all the slaves introduced by the immigration of their masters. The following, from the Virginia Times, confirms this supposition. In the same paragraph which is referred to under the second query, it is said: \\n\\n \\n\\n “We have heard intelligent men estimate the number of slaves exported from Virginia, within the last twelve months, at a hundred and twenty thousand, each slave averaging at least six hundred dollars, making an aggregate of seventy-two million dollars. Of the number of slaves exported, not more than one-third have been sold; the others having been carried by their masters, who have removed.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Assuming one-third to be the proportion of the 148sold, there are more than eighty thousand imported for sale into the four States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas. Supposing one-half of eighty thousand to be sold into the other buying states,—S. Carolina, Georgia, and the territory of Florida,—and we are brought to the conclusion that more than a hundred and twenty thousand slaves were, for some years previous to the great pecuniary pressure in 1837, exported from the breeding to the consuming states. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Baltimore American gives the following from a Mississippi paper of 1837: \\n\\n \\n\\n “The report made by the committee of the citizens of Mobile, appointed at their meeting held on the 1st instant; on the subject of the existing pecuniary pressure, states that so large has been the return of slave labor, that purchases by Alabama of that species of property from other states, since 1833, have amounted to about ten million dollars annually.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Dealing in slaves,” says the Baltimore (Maryland) Register of 1829, “has become a large business; establishments are made in several places in Maryland and Virginia, at which they are sold like cattle. These places of deposit are strongly built, and well supplied with iron thumb-screws and gags, and ornamented with cowskins and other whips, oftentimes bloody.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Professor Dew, now President of the University of William and Mary, in Virginia, in his review of the debate in the Virginia legislature in 1831–2, says (p. 120): \\n\\n \\n\\n “A full equivalent being left in the place of the slave (the purchase-money), this emigration becomes an advantage to the state, and does not check the black population as much as at first view we might imagine; because it furnishes every inducement to the master to attend to the negroes, to encourage breeding, and to cause the greatest number possible to be raised.” Again: “Virginia is, in fact, a negro-raising state for the other states.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Goode, of Virginia, in his speech before the Virginia legislature, in January, 1832, said: \\n\\n \\n\\n “The superior usefulness of the slaves in the South will constitute an effectual demand, which will remove them from our limits. We shall send them from our state, because it will be our interest to do so. But gentlemen are alarmed lest the markets of other states be closed against the introduction of our slaves. Sir, the demand for slave labor must increase,” \u0026c. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the debates of the Virginia Convention, in 1829, Judge Upshur said: \\n\\n \\n\\n “The value of slaves as an article of property depends much on the state of the market abroad. In this view, it is the value of land abroad, and not of land here, which furnishes the ratio. Nothing is more fluctuating than the value of slaves. A late law of Louisiana reduced their value twenty-five per cent. in two hours after its passage was known. If it should be our lot, as I trust it will be, to acquire the country of Texas, their price will rise again.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Hon. Philip Doddridge, of Virginia, in his speech in the Virginia Convention, in 1829 (Debates p. 89), said: \\n\\n \\n\\n “The acquisition of Texas will greatly enhance the value of the property in question (Virginia slaves).” \\n\\n \\n\\n Rev. Dr. Graham, of Fayetteville, North Carolina, at a Colonization meeting held at that place in the fall of 1837, said: \\n\\n \\n\\n “There were nearly seven thousand slaves offered in New Orleans market, last winter. From Virginia alone six thousand were annually sent to the South, and from Virginia and North Carolina there had gone to the South, in the last twenty years, THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND SLAVES.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Hon. Henry Clay, of Kentucky, in his speech before the Colonization Society, in 1829, says: \\n\\n \\n\\n “It is believed that nowhere in the farming portion of the United States would slave labor be generally employed, if the proprietor were not tempted to raise slaves by the high price of the southern markets, which keeps it up in his own.” \\n\\n \\n\\n The New York Journal of Commerce of October 12th, 1835, contains a letter from a Virginian, whom the editor calls “a very good and sensible man,” asserting that twenty thousand slaves had been driven to the South from Virginia that year, but little more than three-fourths of which had then elapsed. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Gholson, of Virginia, in his speech in the legislature of that state, January 18, 1831 (see Richmond Whig), says: \\n\\n \\n\\n “It has always (perhaps erroneously) been considered, by steady and old-fashioned people, that the owner of land had a reasonable right to its annual profits; the owner of orchards to their annual fruits; the owner of brood mares to their product; and the owner of female slaves to their increase. We have not the fine-spun intelligence nor legal acumen to discover the technical distinctions drawn by gentlemen (that is, the distinction between female slaves and brood mares). The legal maxim of partus sequitur ventrem is co?val with the existence of the right of property itself, and is founded in wisdom and justice. It is on the justice and inviolability of this maxim that the master foregoes the service of the female slave, has her nursed and attended during the period of her gestation, and raises the helpless infant offspring. The value of the property justifies the expense, and I do not hesitate to say that in its increase consists much of our wealth.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Can any comment on the state of public sentiment produced by slavery equal the simple reading of this extract, if we remember that it was spoken in the Virginia legislature? One would think the cold cheek of Washington would redden in its grave for shame, that his native state had sunk so low. That there were Virginian hearts to feel this disgrace is evident from the following reply of Mr. Faulkner to Mr. Gholson, in the Virginia House of Delegates, 1832. See Richmond Whig: \\n\\n \\n\\n “But he (Mr. Gholson) has labored to show that the abolition of slavery would be impolitic, because your slaves constitute the entire wealth of the state, all the productive capacity Virginia possesses; and, sir, as things are, I believe he is correct. He says that the slaves constitute the entire available wealth of Eastern Virginia. Is it true that for two hundred years the only increase in the wealth and resources of Virginia has been a remnant of the natural increase of this miserable race? Can it be that on this increase she places her sole dependence? Until I heard these declarations, I had not fully conceived the horrible extent of this evil. These gentlemen 149state the fact, which the history and present aspect of the commonwealth but too well sustain. What, sir! have you lived for two hundred years without personal effort or productive industry, in extravagance and indolence, sustained alone by the return from the sales of the increase of slaves, and retaining merely such a number as your now impoverished lands can sustain as STOCK?” \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Thomas Jefferson Randolph in the Virginia legislature used the following language (Liberty Bell, p. 20): \\n\\n \\n\\n “I agree with gentlemen in the necessity of arming the state for internal defence. I will unite with them in any effort to restore confidence to the public mind, and to conduce to the sense of the safety of our wives and our children. Yet, sir, I must ask upon whom is to fall the burden of this defence? Not upon the lordly masters of their hundred slaves, who will never turn out except to retire with their families when danger threatens. No, sir; it is to fall upon the less wealthy class of our citizens, chiefly upon the non-slaveholder. I have known patrols turned out where there was not a slave-holder among them; and this is the practice of the country. I have slept in times of alarm quiet in bed, without having a thought of care, while these individuals, owning none of this property themselves, were patrolling under a compulsory process, for a pittance of seventy-five cents per twelve hours, the very curtilage of my house, and guarding that property which was alike dangerous to them and myself. After all, this is but an expedient. As this population becomes more numerous, it becomes less productive. Your guard must be increased, until finally its profits will not pay for the expense of its subjection. Slavery has the effect of lessening the free population of a country. \\n\\n \\n\\n “The gentleman has spoken of the increase of the female slaves being a part of the profit. It is admitted; but no great evil can be averted, no good attained, without some inconvenience. It may be questioned how far it is desirable to foster and encourage this branch of profit. It is a practice, and an increasing practice, in parts of Virginia, to rear slaves for market. How can an honorable mind, a patriot, and a lover of his country, bear to see this Ancient Dominion, rendered illustrious by the noble devotion and patriotism of her sons in the cause of liberty, converted into one grand menagerie, where men are to be reared for the market, like oxen for the shambles? Is it better, is it not worse, than the slave-trade;—that trade which enlisted the labor of the good and wise of every creed, and every clime, to abolish it? The trader receives the slave, a stranger in language, aspect and manners, from the merchant who has brought him from the interior. The ties of father, mother, husband and child, have all been rent in twain; before he receives him, his soul has become callous. But here, sir, individuals whom the master has known from infancy, whom he has seen sporting in the innocent gambols of childhood, who have been accustomed to look to him for protection, he tears from the mother’s arms, and sells into a strange country, among strange people, subject to cruel taskmasters. \\n\\n \\n\\n “He has attempted to justify slavery here because it exists in Africa, and has stated that it exists all over the world. Upon the same principle, he could justify Mahometanism, with its plurality of wives, petty wars for plunder, robbery and murder, or any other of the abominations and enormities of savage tribes. Does slavery exist in any part of civilized Europe?—No sir, in no part of it.” \\n\\n \\n\\n The calculations in the volume from which we have been quoting were made in the year 1841. Since that time, the area of the southern slave-market has been doubled, and the trade has undergone a proportional increase. Southern papers are full of its advertisements. It is, in fact, the great trade of the country. From the single port of Baltimore, in the last two years, a thousand and thirty-three slaves have been shipped to the southern market, as is apparent from the following report of the custom-house officer: \\n\\n ABSTRACT OF THE NUMBER OF VESSELS CLEARED IN THE DISTRICT OF BALTIMORE FOR SOUTHERN PORTS, HAVING SLAVES ON BOARD, FROM JAN. 1, 1851, TO NOVEMBER 20, 1852. \\n\\n \\n\\n Date.

But this is only one port, and only one mode of exporting; for multitudes of them are sent in coffles over land; and yet Mr. J. Thornton Randolph represents the negroes of Virginia as living in pastoral security, smoking their pipes under their own vines and fig-trees, the venerable patriarch of the flock declaring that “he nebber hab hear such a ting as a nigger sold to Georgia all his life, unless dat nigger did someting very bad.” \\n\\n \\n\\n An affecting picture of the consequences of this traffic upon both master and slave is drawn by the committee of the volume from which we have quoted. \\n\\n \\n\\n The writer cannot conclude this chapter better than by the language which they have used. \\n\\n \\n\\n This system bears with extreme severity upon the slave. It subjects him to a perpetual fear of being sold to the “soul-driver,” which to the slave is the realization of all conceivable woes and horrors, more dreaded than death. An awful apprehension of this fate haunts the poor sufferer by day and by night, from his cradle to his grave. Suspense hangs like a thunder-cloud over his head. He knows that there is not a passing hour, whether he wakes or sleeps, which may not be THE LAST that he shall spend with his wife and children. Every day or week some acquaintance is snatched from his side, and thus the consciousness of his own danger is kept continually awake. “Surely my turn will come next,” is his harrowing conviction; for he knows that he was reared for this, as the ox for the yoke, or the sheep for the slaughter. In this aspect, the slave’s condition is truly indescribable. Suspense, even when it relates to an event of no great moment, and “endureth but for a night,” is hard to bear. But when it broods over all, absolutely all that is dear, chilling the present with its deep shade, and casting its awful gloom over the future, it must break the heart! Such is the suspense under which every slave in the breeding states lives. It poisons all his little lot of bliss. If a father, he cannot go forth to his toil without bidding a mental farewell to his wife and children. He cannot return, weary and worn, from the field, with any certainty that he shall not find his home robbed and desolate. Nor can he seek his bed of straw and rags without the frightful misgiving that his wife may be torn from his arms before morning. Should a white stranger approach his master’s mansion, he fears that the soul-driver has come, and awaits in terror the overseer’s mandate, “You are sold; follow that man.” There is no being on earth whom the slaves of the breeding states regard with so much horror as the trader. He is to them what the prowling kidnapper is to their less wretched brethren in the wilds of Africa. The master knows this, and that there is no punishment so effectual to secure labor, or deter from misconduct, as the threat of being delivered to the soul-driver.[20] Another consequence of this system is the prevalence of licentiousness. This is indeed one of the foul features of slavery everywhere; but it is especially prevalent and indiscriminate where slave-breeding is conducted as a business. It grows directly out of the system, and is inseparable from it. * * * The pecuniary inducement to general pollution must be very strong, since the larger the slave increase the greater the master’s gains, and especially since the mixed blood demands a considerably higher price than the pure black. \\n\\n \\n\\n The remainder of the extract contains specifications too dreadful to be quoted. We can only refer the reader to the volume, p. 13. \\n\\n \\n\\n The poets of America, true to the holy soul of their divine art, have shed over some of the horrid realities of this trade the pathetic light of poetry. Longfellow and Whittier have told us, in verses beautiful as strung pearls, yet sorrowful as a mother’s tears, some of the incidents of this unnatural and ghastly traffic. For the sake of a common humanity, let us hope that the first extract describes no common event. \\n\\n THE QUADROON GIRL. \\n\\n The Slaver in the broad lagoon \\n\\n Lay moored with idle sail; \\n\\n He waited for the rising moon, \\n\\n And for the evening gale. \\n\\n Under the shore his boat was tied \\n\\n And all her listless crew \\n\\n Watched the gray alligator slide \\n\\n Into the still bayou. \\n\\n Odors of orange-flowers and spice \\n\\n Reached them, from time to time, \\n\\n Like airs that breathe from Paradise \\n\\n Upon a world of crime. \\n\\n The Planter, under his roof of thatch, \\n\\n Smoked thoughtfully and slow; \\n\\n The Slaver’s thumb was on the latch, \\n\\n He scorned in haste to go. \\n\\n He said, “My ship at anchor rides \\n\\n In yonder broad lagoon; \\n\\n I only wait the evening tides, \\n\\n And the rising of the moon.” \\n\\n Before them, with her face upraised, \\n\\n In timid attitude, \\n\\n Like one half curious, half amazed, \\n\\n A Quadroon maiden stood. \\n\\n Her eyes were large, and full of light, \\n\\n Her arms and neck were bare; \\n\\n No garment she wore, save a kirtle bright, \\n\\n And her own long raven hair. \\n\\n And on her lips there played a smile \\n\\n As holy, meek, and faint, \\n\\n As lights in some cathedral aisle \\n\\n The features of a saint. \\n\\n “The soil is barren, the farm is old,” \\n\\n The thoughtful Planter said; \\n\\n Then looked upon the Slaver’s gold, \\n\\n And then upon the maid. \\n\\n His heart within him was at strife \\n\\n With such accursed gains; \\n\\n For he knew whose passions gave her life, \\n\\n Whose blood ran in her veins. \\n\\n 150But the voice of nature was too weak; \\n\\n He took the glittering gold! \\n\\n Then pale as death grew the maiden’s cheek, \\n\\n Her hands as icy cold. \\n\\n The Slaver led her from the door, \\n\\n He led her by the hand, \\n\\n To be his slave and paramour \\n\\n In a strange and distant land! \\n\\n THE FAREWELL \\n\\n OF A VIRGINIA SLAVE MOTHER TO HER DAUGHTERS, SOLD INTO SOUTHERN BONDAGE. \\n\\n Gone, gone,—sold and gone, \\n\\n To the rice-swamp dank and lone. \\n\\n Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings, \\n\\n Where the noisome insect stings, \\n\\n Where the fever demon strews \\n\\n Poison with the falling dews, \\n\\n Where the sickly sunbeams glare \\n\\n Through the hot and misty air,— \\n\\n Gone, gone,—sold and gone, \\n\\n To the rice-swamp dank and lone, \\n\\n From Virginia’s hills and waters,— \\n\\n Woe is me, my stolen daughters! \\n\\n Gone, gone,—sold and gone, \\n\\n To the rice-swamp dank and lone. \\n\\n There no mother’s eye is near them, \\n\\n There no mother’s ear can hear them; \\n\\n Never, when the torturing lash \\n\\n Seams their back with many a gash, \\n\\n Shall a mother’s kindness bless them, \\n\\n Or a mother’s arms caress them. \\n\\n Gone, gone, \u0026c. \\n\\n Gone, gone,—sold and gone, \\n\\n To the rice-swamp dank and lone. \\n\\n O, when weary, sad, and slow, \\n\\n From the fields at night they go, \\n\\n Faint with toil, and racked with pain, \\n\\n To their cheerless homes again,— \\n\\n There no brother’s voice shall greet them, \\n\\n There no father’s welcome meet them. \\n\\n Gone, gone, \u0026c. \\n\\n Gone, gone,—sold and gone, \\n\\n To the rice-swamp dank and lone. \\n\\n From the tree whose shadow lay \\n\\n On their childhood’s place of play; \\n\\n From the cool spring where they drank; \\n\\n Rock, and hill, and rivulet bank; \\n\\n From the solemn house of prayer, \\n\\n And the holy counsels there,— \\n\\n Gone, gone, \u0026c. \\n\\n Gone, gone,—sold and gone, \\n\\n To the rice-swamp dank and lone; \\n\\n Toiling through the weary day, \\n\\n And at night the spoiler’s prey. \\n\\n O, that they had earlier died, \\n\\n Sleeping calmly, side by side, \\n\\n Where the tyrant’s power is o’er, \\n\\n And the fetter galls no more! \\n\\n Gone, gone, \u0026c. \\n\\n Gone, gone,—sold and gone, \\n\\n To the rice-swamp dank and lone. \\n\\n By the holy love He beareth, \\n\\n By the bruised reed He spareth, \\n\\n O, may He, to whom alone \\n\\n All their cruel wrongs are known, \\n\\n Still their hope and refuge prove, \\n\\n With a more than mother’s love! \\n\\n Gone, gone, \u0026c. \\n\\n John G. Whittier. \\n\\n \\n\\n The following extract from a letter of Dr. Bailey, in the Era, 1847, presents a view of this subject more creditable to some Virginia families. May the number that refuse to part with slaves except by emancipation increase! \\n\\n \\n\\n The sale of slaves to the south is carried to a great extent. The slave-holders do not, so far as I can learn, raise them for that special purpose. But, here is a man with a score of slaves, located on an exhausted plantation. It must furnish support for all; but, while they increase, its capacity of supply decreases. The result is, he must emancipate or sell. But he has fallen into debt, and he sells to relieve himself from debt, and also from an excess of mouths. Or, he requires money to educate his children; or, his negroes are sold under execution. From these and other causes, large numbers of slaves are continually disappearing from the state, so that the next census will undoubtedly show a marked diminution of the slave population. \\n\\n \\n\\n The season for this trade is generally from November to April; and some estimate that the average number of slaves passing by the southern railroad weekly, during that period of six months, is at least two hundred. A slave-trader told me that he had known one hundred pass in a single night. But this is only one route. Large numbers are sent off westwardly, and also by sea, coastwise. The Davises, in Petersburg, are the great slave-dealers. They are Jews, who came to that place many years ago as poor peddlers; and, I am informed, are members of a family which has its representatives in Philadelphia, New York, \u0026c.! These men are always in the market, giving the highest price for slaves. During the summer and fall they buy them up at low prices, trim, shave, wash them, fatten them so that they may look sleek, and sell them to great profit. It might not be unprofitable to inquire how much Northern capital, and what firms in some of the Northern cities, are connected with this detestable business. \\n\\n \\n\\n There are many planters here who cannot be persuaded to sell their slaves. They have far more than they can find work for, and could at any time obtain a high price for them. The temptation is strong, for they want more money and fewer dependants. But they resist it, and nothing can induce them to part with a single slave, though they know that they would be greatly the gainers in a pecuniary sense, were they to sell one-half of them. Such men are too good to be slave-holders. Would that they might see it their duty to go one step further, and become emancipators! The majority of this class of planters are religious men, and this is the class to which generally are to be referred the various cases of emancipation by will, of which from time to time we hear accounts. \\n\\n \\n\\n 20. This horribly expressive appellation is in common use among the slaves of the breeding states. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/1809/52596.html","bookId":26,"book":{"id":26,"title":"Harriet Beecher Stowe","description":"简介： At different times, doubt has been expressed whether the representations of Uncle Toms Cabin are a fair representation of slavery as it at present exists.
