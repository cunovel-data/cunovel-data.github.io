{"id":34387,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION","content":"You know, the longer I live, the more clearly I see that half the trouble in this bally world is caused by the light-hearted and thoughtless way in which chappies dash off letters of introduction and hand them to other chappies to deliver to chappies of the third part. It\u0027s one of those things that make you wish you were living in the Stone Age. What I mean to say is, if a fellow in those days wanted to give anyone a letter of introduction, he had to spend a month or so carving it on a large-sized boulder, and the chances were that the other chappie got so sick of lugging the thing round in the hot sun that he dropped it after the first mile. But nowadays it\u0027s so easy to write letters of introduction that everybody does it without a second thought, with the result that some perfectly harmless cove like myself gets in the soup. Mark you, all the above is what you might call the result of my riper experience. I don\u0027t mind admitting that in the first flush of the thing, so, to speak, when Jeeves told me—this would be about three weeks after I\u0027d landed in America—that a blighter called Cyril Bassington-Bassington had arrived and I found that he had brought a letter of introduction to me from Aunt Agatha ... where was I? Oh, yes ... I don\u0027t mind admitting, I was saying, that just at first I was rather[Pg 89] bucked. You see, after the painful events which had resulted in my leaving England I hadn\u0027t expected to get any sort of letter from Aunt Agatha which would pass the censor, so to speak. And it was a pleasant surprise to open this one and find it almost civil. Chilly, perhaps, in parts, but on the whole quite tolerably polite. I looked on the thing as a hopeful sign. Sort of olive-branch, you know. Or do I mean orange blossom? What I\u0027m getting at is that the fact that Aunt Agatha was writing to me without calling me names seemed, more or less, like a step in the direction of peace. And I was all for peace, and that right speedily. I\u0027m not saying a word against New York, mind you. I liked the place, and was having quite a ripe time there. But the fact remains that a fellow who\u0027s been used to London all his life does get a trifle homesick on a foreign strand, and I wanted to pop back to the cosy old flat in Berkeley Street—which could only be done when Aunt Agatha had simmered down and got over the Glossop episode. I know that London is a biggish city, but, believe me, it isn\u0027t half big enough for any fellow to live in with Aunt Agatha when she\u0027s after him with the old hatchet. And so I\u0027m bound to say I looked on this chump Bassington-Bassington, when he arrived, more or less as a Dove of Peace, and was all for him. He would seem from contemporary accounts to have blown in one morning at seven-forty-five, that being the ghastly sort of hour they shoot you off the liner in New York. He was given the respectful raspberry by Jeeves, and told to try again about three hours later, when there would be a sporting chance of my having sprung from my bed with a glad cry to welcome another day and all that sort of thing. Which was rather decent of Jeeves, by the way, for it so happened that there was a slight[Pg 90] estrangement, a touch of coldness, a bit of a row in other words, between us at the moment because of some rather priceless purple socks which I was wearing against his wishes: and a lesser man might easily have snatched at the chance of getting back at me a bit by loosing Cyril into my bedchamber at a moment when I couldn\u0027t have stood a two-minutes\u0027 conversation with my dearest pal. For until I have had my early cup of tea and have brooded on life for a bit absolutely undisturbed, I\u0027m not much of a lad for the merry chit-chat. So Jeeves very sportingly shot Cyril out into the crisp morning air, and didn\u0027t let me know of his existence till he brought his card in with the Bohea. \"And what might all this be, Jeeves?\" I said, giving the thing the glassy gaze. \"The gentleman has arrived from England, I understand, sir. He called to see you earlier in the day.\" \"Good Lord, Jeeves! You don\u0027t mean to say the day starts earlier than this?\" \"He desired me to say he would return later, sir.\" \"I\u0027ve never heard of him. Have you ever heard of him, Jeeves?\" \"I am familiar with the name Bassington-Bassington, sir. There are three branches of the Bassington-Bassington family—the Shropshire Bassington-Bassingtons, the Hampshire Bassington-Bassingtons, and the Kent Bassington-Bassingtons.\" \"England seems pretty well stocked up with Bassington-Bassingtons.\" \"Tolerably so, sir.\" \"No chance of a sudden shortage, I mean, what?\" \"Presumably not, sir.\" \"And what sort of a specimen is this one?\" [Pg 91] \"I could not say, sir, on such short acquaintance.\" \"Will you give me a sporting two to one, Jeeves, judging from what you have seen of him, that this chappie is not a blighter or an excrescence?\" \"No, sir. I should not care to venture such liberal odds.\" \"I knew it. Well, the only thing that remains to be discovered is what kind of a blighter he is.\" \"Time will tell, sir. The gentleman brought a letter for you, sir.\" \"Oh, he did, did he?\" I said, and grasped the communication. And then I recognised the handwriting. \"I say, Jeeves, this is from my Aunt Agatha!\" \"Indeed, sir?\" \"Don\u0027t dismiss it in that light way. Don\u0027t you see what this means? She says she wants me to look after this excrescence while he\u0027s in New York. By Jove, Jeeves, if I only fawn on him a bit, so that he sends back a favourable report to head-quarters, I may yet be able to get back to England in time for Goodwood. Now is certainly the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party, Jeeves. We must rally round and cosset this cove in no uncertain manner.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"He isn\u0027t going to stay in New York long,\" I said, taking another look at the letter. \"He\u0027s headed for Washington. Going to give the nibs there the once-over, apparently, before taking a whirl at the Diplomatic Service. I should say that we can win this lad\u0027s esteem and affection with a lunch and a couple of dinners, what?\" \"I fancy that should be entirely adequate, sir.\" \"This is the jolliest thing that\u0027s happened since we left England. It looks to me as if the sun were breaking through the clouds.\" [Pg 92] \"Very possibly, sir.\" He started to put out my things, and there was an awkward sort of silence. \"Not those socks, Jeeves,\" I said, gulping a bit but having a dash at the careless, off-hand tone. \"Give me the purple ones.\" \"I beg your pardon, sir?\" \"Those jolly purple ones.\" \"Very good, sir.\" He lugged them out of the drawer as if he were a vegetarian fishing a caterpillar out of the salad. You could see he was feeling deeply. Deuced painful and all that, this sort of thing, but a chappie has got to assert himself every now and then. Absolutely. * * * * * I was looking for Cyril to show up again any time after breakfast, but he didn\u0027t appear: so towards one o\u0027clock I trickled out to the Lambs Club, where I had an appointment to feed the Wooster face with a cove of the name of Caffyn I\u0027d got pally with since my arrival—George Caffyn, a fellow who wrote plays and what not. I\u0027d made a lot of friends during my stay in New York, the city being crammed with bonhomous lads who one and all extended a welcoming hand to the stranger in their midst. Caffyn was a bit late, but bobbed up finally, saying that he had been kept at a rehearsal of his new musical comedy, \"Ask Dad\"; and we started in. We had just reached the coffee, when the waiter came up and said that Jeeves wanted to see me. Jeeves was in the waiting-room. He gave the socks one pained look as I came in, then averted his eyes. [Pg 93] \"Mr. Bassington-Bassington has just telephoned, sir.\" \"Oh?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Where is he?\" \"In prison, sir.\" I reeled against the wallpaper. A nice thing to happen to Aunt Agatha\u0027s nominee on his first morning under my wing, I did not think! \"In prison!\" \"Yes, sir. He said on the telephone that he had been arrested and would be glad if you could step round and bail him out.\" \"Arrested! What for?\" \"He did not favour me with his confidence in that respect, sir.\" \"This is a bit thick, Jeeves.\" \"Precisely, sir.\" I collected old George, who very decently volunteered to stagger along with me, and we hopped into a taxi. We sat around at the police-station for a bit on a wooden bench in a sort of ante-room, and presently a policeman appeared, leading in Cyril. \"Halloa! Halloa! Halloa!\" I said. \"What?\" My experience is that a fellow never really looks his best just after he\u0027s come out of a cell. When I was up at Oxford, I used to have a regular job bailing out a pal of mine who never failed to get pinched every Boat-Race night, and he always looked like something that had been dug up by the roots. Cyril was in pretty much the same sort of shape. He had a black eye and a torn collar, and altogether was nothing to write home about—especially if one was writing to Aunt Agatha. He was a thin, tall chappie with a lot of light hair and pale-blue goggly eyes which made him look like one of the rarer kinds of fish. [Pg 94] \"I got your message,\" I said. \"Oh, are you Bertie Wooster?\" \"Absolutely. And this is my pal George Caffyn. Writes plays and what not, don\u0027t you know.\" We all shook hands, and the policeman, having retrieved a piece of chewing-gum from the underside of a chair, where he had parked it against a rainy day, went off into a corner and began to contemplate the infinite. \"This is a rotten country,\" said Cyril. \"Oh, I don\u0027t know, you know, don\u0027t you know!\" I said. \"We do our best,\" said George. \"Old George is an American,\" I explained. \"Writes plays, don\u0027t you know, and what not.\" \"Of course, I didn\u0027t invent the country,\" said George. \"That was Columbus. But I shall be delighted to consider any improvements you may suggest and lay them before the proper authorities.\" \"Well, why don\u0027t the policemen in New York dress properly?\" George took a look at the chewing officer across the room. \"I don\u0027t see anything missing,\" he said. \"I mean to say, why don\u0027t they wear helmets like they do in London? Why do they look like postmen? It isn\u0027t fair on a fellow. Makes it dashed confusing. I was simply standing on the pavement, looking at things, when a fellow who looked like a postman prodded me in the ribs with a club. I didn\u0027t see why I should have postmen prodding me. Why the dickens should a fellow come three thousand miles to be prodded by postmen?\" \"The point is well taken,\" said George. \"What did you do?\" \"I gave him a shove, you know. I\u0027ve got a[Pg 95] frightfully hasty temper, you know. All the Bassington-Bassingtons have got frightfully hasty tempers, don\u0027t you know! And then he biffed me in the eye and lugged me off to this beastly place.\" \"I\u0027ll fix it, old son,\" I said. And I hauled out the bank-roll and went off to open negotiations, leaving Cyril to talk to George. I don\u0027t mind admitting that I was a bit perturbed. There were furrows in the old brow, and I had a kind of foreboding feeling. As long as this chump stayed in New York, I was responsible for him: and he didn\u0027t give me the impression of being the species of cove a reasonable chappie would care to be responsible for for more than about three minutes. I mused with a considerable amount of tensity over Cyril that night, when I had got home and Jeeves had brought me the final whisky. I couldn\u0027t help feeling that this visit of his to America was going to be one of those times that try men\u0027s souls and what not. I hauled out Aunt Agatha\u0027s letter of introduction and re-read it, and there was no getting away from the fact that she undoubtedly appeared to be somewhat wrapped up in this blighter and to consider it my mission in life to shield him from harm while on the premises. I was deuced thankful that he had taken such a liking for George Caffyn, old George being a steady sort of cove. After I had got him out of his dungeon-cell, he and old George had gone off together, as chummy as brothers, to watch the afternoon rehearsal of \"Ask Dad.\" There was some talk, I gathered, of their dining together. I felt pretty easy in my mind while George had his eye on him. I had got about as far as this in my meditations, when Jeeves came in with a telegram. At least, it wasn\u0027t a telegram: it was a cable—from Aunt Agatha, and this is what it said:— [Pg 96] Has Cyril Bassington-Bassington called yet? On no account introduce him into theatrical circles. Vitally important. Letter follows. I read it a couple of times. \"This is rummy, Jeeves!\" \"Yes, sir?\" \"Very rummy and dashed disturbing!\" \"Will there be anything further to-night, sir?\" Of course, if he was going to be as bally unsympathetic as that there was nothing to be done My idea had been to show him the cable and ask his advice. But if he was letting those purple socks rankle to that extent, the good old noblesse oblige of the Woosters couldn\u0027t lower itself to the extent of pleading with the man. Absolutely not. So I gave it a miss. \"Nothing more, thanks.\" \"Good night, sir.\" \"Good night.\" He floated away, and I sat down to think the thing over. I had been directing the best efforts of the old bean to the problem for a matter of half an hour, when there was a ring at the bell. I went to the door, and there was Cyril, looking pretty festive. \"I\u0027ll come in for a bit if I may,\" he said. \"Got something rather priceless to tell you.\" He curveted past me into the sitting-room, and when I got there after shutting the front door I found him reading Aunt Agatha\u0027s cable and giggling in a rummy sort of manner. \"Oughtn\u0027t to have looked at this, I suppose. Caught sight of my name and read it without thinking. I say, Wooster, old friend of my youth, this is rather funny. Do you mind if I have a drink? Thanks awfully and all that sort of rot. Yes, it\u0027s rather funny, considering what I came[Pg 97] to tell you. Jolly old Caffyn has given me a small part in that musical comedy of his, \u0027Ask Dad.\u0027 Only a bit, you know, but quite tolerably ripe. I\u0027m feeling frightfully braced, don\u0027t you know!\" He drank his drink, and went on. He didn\u0027t seem to notice that I wasn\u0027t jumping about the room, yapping with joy. \"You know, I\u0027ve always wanted to go on the stage, you know,\" he said. \"But my jolly old guv\u0027nor wouldn\u0027t stick it at any price. Put the old Waukeesi down with a bang, and turned bright purple whenever the subject was mentioned. That\u0027s the real reason why I came over here, if you want to know. I knew there wasn\u0027t a chance of my being able to work this stage wheeze in London without somebody getting on to it and tipping off the guv\u0027nor, so I rather brainily sprang the scheme of popping over to Washington to broaden my mind. There\u0027s nobody to interfere on this side, you see, so I can go right ahead!\" I tried to reason with the poor chump. \"But your guv\u0027nor will have to know some time.\" \"That\u0027ll be all right. I shall be the jolly old star by then, and he won\u0027t have a leg to stand on.\" \"It seems to me he\u0027ll have one leg to stand on while he kicks me with the other.\" \"Why, where do you come in? What have you got to do with it?\" \"I introduced you to George Caffyn.\" \"So you did, old top, so you did. I\u0027d quite forgotten. I ought to have thanked you before. Well, so long. There\u0027s an early rehearsal of \u0027Ask Dad\u0027 to-morrow morning, and I must be toddling. Rummy the thing should be called \u0027Ask Dad,\u0027 when that\u0027s just what I\u0027m not going to do. See what I mean, what, what? Well, pip-pip!\" [Pg 98] \"Toodle-oo!\" I said sadly, and the blighter scudded off. I dived for the phone and called up George Caffyn. \"I say, George, what\u0027s all this about Cyril Bassington-Bassington?\" \"What about him?\" \"He tells me you\u0027ve given him a part in your show.\" \"Oh, yes. Just a few lines.\" \"But I\u0027ve just had fifty-seven cables from home telling me on no account to let him go on the stage.\" \"I\u0027m sorry. But Cyril is just the type I need for that part. He\u0027s simply got to be himself.\" \"It\u0027s pretty tough on me, George, old man. My Aunt Agatha sent this blighter over with a letter of introduction to me, and she will hold me responsible.\" \"She\u0027ll cut you out of her will?\" \"It isn\u0027t a question of money. But—of course, you\u0027ve never met my Aunt Agatha, so it\u0027s rather hard to explain. But she\u0027s a sort of human vampire-bat, and she\u0027ll make things most fearfully unpleasant for me when I go back to England. She\u0027s the kind of woman who comes and rags you before breakfast, don\u0027t you know.\" \"Well, don\u0027t go back to England, then. Stick here and become President.\" \"But, George, old top——!\" \"Good night!\" \"But, I say, George, old man!\" \"You didn\u0027t get my last remark. It was \u0027Good night!\u0027 You Idle Rich may not need any sleep, but I\u0027ve got to be bright and fresh in the morning. God bless you!\" I felt as if I hadn\u0027t a friend in the world. I was so jolly well worked up that I went and banged on Jeeves\u0027s door. It wasn\u0027t a thing I\u0027d have cared to do as a rule, but it seemed to me that now was[Pg 99] the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party, so to speak, and that it was up to Jeeves to rally round the young master, even if it broke up his beauty-sleep. Jeeves emerged in a brown dressing-gown. \"Sir?\" \"Deuced sorry to wake you up, Jeeves, and what not, but all sorts of dashed disturbing things have been happening.\" \"I was not asleep. It is my practice, on retiring, to read a few pages of some instructive book.\" \"That\u0027s good! What I mean to say is, if you\u0027ve just finished exercising the old bean, it\u0027s probably in mid-season form for tackling problems. Jeeves, Mr. Bassington-Bassington is going on the stage!\" \"Indeed, sir?\" \"Ah! The thing doesn\u0027t hit you! You don\u0027t get it properly! Here\u0027s the point. All his family are most fearfully dead against his going on the stage. There\u0027s going to be no end of trouble if he isn\u0027t headed off. And, what\u0027s worse, my Aunt Agatha will blame me, you see.\" \"I see, sir.\" \"Well, can\u0027t you think of some way of stopping him?\" \"Not, I confess, at the moment, sir.\" \"Well, have a stab at it.\" \"I will give the matter my best consideration, sir. Will there be anything further to-night?\" \"I hope not! I\u0027ve had all I can stand already.\" \"Very good, sir.\" He popped off.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3042/84048.html","bookId":1032,"book":{"id":1032,"title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","description":"简介： Good morning, sir, said Jeeves.
