{"id":34395,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII BINGO AND THE LITTLE WOMAN","content":"It must have been a week or so after the departure of Claude and Eustace that I ran into young Bingo Little in the smoking-room of the Senior Liberal Club. He was lying back in an arm-chair with his mouth open and a sort of goofy expression in his eyes, while a grey-bearded cove in the middle distance watched him with so much dislike that I concluded that Bingo had pinched his favourite seat. That\u0027s the worst of being in a strange club—absolutely without intending it, you find yourself constantly trampling upon the vested interests of the Oldest Inhabitants. \"Hallo, face,\" I said. \"Cheerio, ugly,\" said young Bingo, and we settled down to have a small one before lunch. Once a year the committee of the Drones decides that the old club could do with a wash and brush-up, so they shoo us out and dump us down for a few weeks at some other institution. This time we were roosting at the Senior Liberal, and personally I had found the strain pretty fearful. I mean, when you\u0027ve got used to a club where everything\u0027s nice and cheery, and where, if you want to attract a chappie\u0027s attention, you heave a bit of bread at him, it kind of damps you to come to a place where the youngest member is about eighty-seven and it isn\u0027t considered good form to talk to anyone unless you and he were through the Peninsular War[Pg 233] together. It was a relief to come across Bingo. We started to talk in hushed voices. \"This club,\" I said, \"is the limit.\" \"It is the eel\u0027s eyebrows,\" agreed young Bingo. \"I believe that old boy over by the window has been dead three days, but I don\u0027t like to mention it to anyone.\" \"Have you lunched here yet?\" \"No. Why?\" \"They have waitresses instead of waiters.\" \"Good Lord! I thought that went out with the armistice.\" Bingo mused a moment, straightening his tie absently. \"Er—pretty girls?\" he said. \"No.\" He seemed disappointed, but pulled round. \"Well, I\u0027ve heard that the cooking\u0027s the best in London.\" \"So they say. Shall we be going in?\" \"All right. I expect,\" said young Bingo, \"that at the end of the meal—or possibly at the beginning—the waitress will say, \u0027Both together, sir?\u0027 Reply in the affirmative. I haven\u0027t a bean.\" \"Hasn\u0027t your uncle forgiven you yet?\" \"Not yet, confound him!\" I was sorry to hear the row was still on. I resolved to do the poor old thing well at the festive board, and I scanned the menu with some intentness when the girl rolled up with it. \"How would this do you, Bingo?\" I said at length. \"A few plovers\u0027 eggs to weigh in with, a cup of soup, a touch of cold salmon, some cold curry, and a splash of gooseberry tart and cream with a bite of cheese to finish?\" I don\u0027t know that I had expected the man actually to scream with delight, though I had picked the items from my knowledge of his pet dishes, but I had expected him to say something.[Pg 234] I looked up, and found that his attention was elsewhere. He was gazing at the waitress with the look of a dog that\u0027s just remembered where its bone was buried. She was a tallish girl with sort of soft, soulful brown eyes. Nice figure and all that. Rather decent hands, too. I didn\u0027t remember having seen her about before, and I must say she raised the standard of the place quite a bit. \"How about it, laddie?\" I said, being all for getting the order booked and going on to the serious knife-and-fork work. \"Eh?\" said young Bingo absently. I recited the programme once more. \"Oh, yes, fine!\" said Bingo. \"Anything, anything.\" The girl pushed off, and he turned to me with protruding eyes. \"I thought you said they weren\u0027t pretty, Bertie!\" he said reproachfully. \"Oh, my heavens!\" I said. \"You surely haven\u0027t fallen in love again—and with a girl you\u0027ve only just seen?\" \"There are times, Bertie,\" said young Bingo, \"when a look is enough—when, passing through a crowd, we meet somebody\u0027s eye and something seems to whisper....\" At this point the plovers\u0027 eggs arrived, and he suspended his remarks in order to swoop on them with some vigour. \"Jeeves,\" I said that night when I got home, \"stand by.\" \"Sir?\" \"Burnish the old brain and be alert and vigilant. I suspect that Mr. Little will be calling round shortly for sympathy and assistance.\" \"Is Mr. Little in trouble, sir?\" \"Well, you might call it that. He\u0027s in love.[Pg 235] For about the fifty-third time. I ask you, Jeeves, as man to man, did you ever see such a chap?\" \"Mr. Little is certainly warm-hearted, sir.\" \"Warm-hearted! I should think he has to wear asbestos vests. Well, stand by, Jeeves.\" \"Very good, sir.\" And sure enough, it wasn\u0027t ten days before in rolled the old ass, bleating for volunteers to step one pace forward and come to the aid of the party. \"Bertie,\" he said, \"if you are a pal of mine, now is the time to show it.\" \"Proceed, old gargoyle,\" I replied. \"You have our ear.\" \"You remember giving me lunch at the Senior Liberal some days ago. We were waited on by a——\" \"I remember. Tall, lissom female.\" He shuddered somewhat. \"I wish you wouldn\u0027t talk of her like that, dash it all. She\u0027s an angel.\" \"All right. Carry on.\" \"I love her.\" \"Right-o! Push along.\" \"For goodness sake don\u0027t bustle me. Let me tell the story in my own way. I love her, as I was saying, and I want you, Bertie, old boy, to pop round to my uncle and do a bit of diplomatic work. That allowance of mine must be restored, and dashed quick, too. What\u0027s more, it must be increased.\" \"But look here,\" I said, being far from keen on the bally business, \"why not wait awhile?\" \"Wait? What\u0027s the good of waiting?\" \"Well, you know what generally happens when you fall in love. Something goes wrong with the works and you get left. Much better tackle your uncle after the whole thing\u0027s fixed and settled.\" [Pg 236] \"It is fixed and settled. She accepted me this morning.\" \"Good Lord! That\u0027s quick work. You haven\u0027t known her two weeks.\" \"Not in this life, no,\" said young Bingo. \"But she has a sort of idea that we must have met in some previous existence. She thinks I must have been a king in Babylon when she was a Christian slave. I can\u0027t say I remember it myself, but there may be something in it.\" \"Great Scott!\" I said. \"Do waitresses really talk like that?\" \"How should I know how waitresses talk?\" \"Well, you ought to by now. The first time I ever met your uncle was when you hounded me on to ask him if he would rally round to help you marry that girl Mabel in the Piccadilly bun-shop.\" Bingo started violently. A wild gleam came into his eyes. And before I knew what he was up to he had brought down his hand with a most frightful whack on my summer trousering, causing me to leap like a young ram. \"Here!\" I said. \"Sorry,\" said Bingo. \"Excited. Carried away. You\u0027ve given me an idea, Bertie.\" He waited till I had finished massaging the limb, and resumed his remarks. \"Can you throw your mind back to that occasion, Bertie? Do you remember the frightfully subtle scheme I worked? Telling him you were what\u0027s-her-name, the woman who wrote those books, I mean?\" It wasn\u0027t likely I\u0027d forget. The ghastly thing was absolutely seared into my memory. \"That is the line of attack,\" said Bingo. \"That is the scheme. Rosie M. Banks forward once more.\" \"It can\u0027t be done, old thing. Sorry, but it\u0027s out[Pg 237] of the question. I couldn\u0027t go through all that again.\" \"Not for me?\" \"Not for a dozen more like you.\" \"I never thought,\" said Bingo sorrowfully, \"to hear those words from Bertie Wooster!\" \"Well, you\u0027ve heard them now,\" I said. \"Paste them in your hat.\" \"Bertie, we were at school together.\" \"It wasn\u0027t my fault.\" \"We\u0027ve been pals for fifteen years.\" \"I know. It\u0027s going to take me the rest of my life to live it down.\" \"Bertie, old man,\" said Bingo, drawing up his chair closer and starting to knead my shoulder-blade, \"listen! Be reasonable!\" And of course, dash it, at the end of ten minutes I\u0027d allowed the blighter to talk me round. It\u0027s always the way. Anyone can talk me round. If I were in a Trappist monastery, the first thing that would happen would be that some smooth performer would lure me into some frightful idiocy against my better judgment by means of the deaf-and-dumb language. \"Well, what do you want me to do?\" I said, realising that it was hopeless to struggle. \"Start off by sending the old boy an autographed copy of your latest effort with a flattering inscription. That will tickle him to death. Then you pop round and put it across.\" \"What is my latest?\" \"\u0027The Woman Who Braved All,\u0027\" said young Bingo. \"I\u0027ve seen it all over the place. The shop windows and bookstalls are full of nothing but it. It looks to me from the picture on the jacket the sort of book any chappie would be proud to have written. Of course, he will want to discuss it with you.\" [Pg 238] \"Ah!\" I said, cheering up. \"That dishes the scheme, doesn\u0027t it? I don\u0027t know what the bally thing is about.\" \"You will have to read it, naturally.\" \"Read it! No, I say....\" \"Bertie, we were at school together.\" \"Oh, right-o! Right-o!\" I said. \"I knew I could rely on you. You have a heart of gold. Jeeves,\" said young Bingo, as the faithful servitor rolled in, \"Mr. Wooster has a heart of gold.\" \"Very good, sir,\" said Jeeves. Bar a weekly wrestle with the Pink \u0027Un and an occasional dip into the form book I\u0027m not much of a lad for reading, and my sufferings as I tackled \"The Woman\" (curse her!) \"Who Braved All\" were pretty fearful. But I managed to get through it, and only just in time, as it happened, for I\u0027d hardly reached the bit where their lips met in one long, slow kiss and everything was still but for the gentle sighing of the breeze in the laburnum, when a messenger boy brought a note from old Bittlesham asking me to trickle round to lunch. I found the old boy in a mood you could only describe as melting. He had a copy of the book on the table beside him and kept turning the pages in the intervals of dealing with things in aspic and what not. \"Mr. Wooster,\" he said, swallowing a chunk of trout, \"I wish to congratulate you. I wish to thank you. You go from strength to strength. I have read \u0027All For Love\u0027; I have read \u0027Only a Factory Girl\u0027; I know \u0027Madcap Myrtle\u0027 by heart. But this—this is your bravest and best. It tears the heartstrings.\" \"Yes?\" \"Indeed yes! I have read it three times since[Pg 239] you most kindly sent me the volume—I wish to thank you once more for the charming inscription—and I think I may say that I am a better, sweeter, deeper man. I am full of human charity and kindliness toward my species.\" \"No, really?\" \"Indeed, indeed I am.\" \"Towards the whole species?\" \"Towards the whole species.\" \"Even young Bingo?\" I said, trying him pretty high. \"My nephew? Richard?\" He looked a bit thoughtful, but stuck it like a man and refused to hedge. \"Yes, even towards Richard. Well ... that is to say ... perhaps ... yes, even towards Richard.\" \"That\u0027s good, because I wanted to talk about him. He\u0027s pretty hard up, you know.\" \"In straitened circumstances?\" \"Stoney. And he could use a bit of the right stuff paid every quarter, if you felt like unbelting.\" He mused awhile and got through a slab of cold guinea hen before replying. He toyed with the book, and it fell open at page two hundred and fifteen. I couldn\u0027t remember what was on page two hundred and fifteen, but it must have been something tolerably zippy, for his expression changed and he gazed up at me with misty eyes, as if he\u0027d taken a shade too much mustard with his last bite of ham. \"Very well, Mr. Wooster,\" he said. \"Fresh from a perusal of this noble work of yours, I cannot harden my heart. Richard shall have his allowance.\" \"Stout fellow!\" I said. Then it occurred to me that the expression might strike a chappie who weighed seventeen stone as a bit personal. \"Good egg, I mean. That\u0027ll take a weight off his mind. He wants to get married, you know.\" [Pg 240] \"I did not know. And I am not sure that I altogether approve. Who is the lady?\" \"Well, as a matter of fact, she\u0027s a waitress.\" He leaped in his seat. \"You don\u0027t say so, Mr. Wooster! This is remarkable. This is most cheering. I had not given the boy credit for such tenacity of purpose. An excellent trait in him which I had not hitherto suspected. I recollect clearly that, on the occasion when I first had the pleasure of making your acquaintance, nearly eighteen months ago, Richard was desirous of marrying this same waitress.\" I had to break it to him. \"Well, not absolutely this same waitress. In fact, quite a different waitress. Still, a waitress, you know.\" The light of avuncular affection died out of the old boy\u0027s eyes. \"H\u0027m!\" he said a bit dubiously. \"I had supposed that Richard was displaying the quality of constancy which is so rare in the modern young man. I—I must think it over.\" So we left it at that, and I came away and told Bingo the position of affairs. \"Allowance O.K.,\" I said. \"Uncle blessing a trifle wobbly.\" \"Doesn\u0027t he seem to want the wedding bells to ring out?\" \"I left him thinking it over. If I were a bookie, I should feel justified in offering a hundred to eight against.\" \"You can\u0027t have approached him properly. I might have known you would muck it up,\" said young Bingo. Which, considering what I had been through for his sake, struck me as a good bit sharper than a serpent\u0027s tooth. \"It\u0027s awkward,\" said young Bingo. \"It\u0027s[Pg 241] infernally awkward. I can\u0027t tell you all the details at the moment, but ... yes, it\u0027s awkward.\" He helped himself absently to a handful of my cigars and pushed off. I didn\u0027t see him again for three days. Early in the afternoon of the third day he blew in with a flower in his buttonhole and a look on his face as if someone had hit him behind the ear with a stuffed eel skin. \"Hallo, Bertie.\" \"Hallo, old turnip. Where have you been all this while?\" \"Oh, here and there! Ripping weather we\u0027re having, Bertie.\" \"Not bad.\" \"I see the Bank Rate is down again.\" \"No, really?\" \"Disturbing news from Lower Silesia, what?\" \"Oh, dashed!\" He pottered about the room for a bit, babbling at intervals. The boy seemed cuckoo. \"Oh, I say, Bertie!\" he said suddenly, dropping a vase which he had picked off the mantelpiece and was fiddling with. \"I know what it was I wanted to tell you. I\u0027m married.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3042/84056.html","bookId":1032,"book":{"id":1032,"title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","description":"简介： Good morning, sir, said Jeeves.
