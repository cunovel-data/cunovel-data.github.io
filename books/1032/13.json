{"id":34391,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII THE GREAT SERMON HANDICAP","content":"After Goodwood\u0027s over, I generally find that I get a bit restless. I\u0027m not much of a lad for the birds and the trees and the great open spaces as a rule, but there\u0027s no doubt that London\u0027s not at its best in August, and rather tends to give me the pip and make me think of popping down into the country till things have bucked up a trifle. London, about a couple of weeks after that spectacular finish of young Bingo\u0027s which I\u0027ve just been telling you about, was empty and smelled of burning asphalt. All my pals were away, most of the theatres were shut, and they were taking up Piccadilly in large spadefuls. It was most infernally hot. As I sat in the old flat one night trying to muster up energy enough to go to bed, I felt I couldn\u0027t stand it much longer: and when Jeeves came in with the tissue-restorers on a tray I put the thing to him squarely. \"Jeeves,\" I said, wiping the brow and gasping like a stranded goldfish, \"it\u0027s beastly hot.\" \"The weather is oppressive, sir.\" \"Not all the soda, Jeeves.\" \"No, sir.\" \"I think we\u0027ve had about enough of the metrop. for the time being, and require a change. Shift-ho, I think, Jeeves, what?\" \"Just as you say, sir. There is a letter on the tray, sir.\" [Pg 138] \"By Jove, Jeeves, that was practically poetry. Rhymed, did you notice?\" I opened the letter. \"I say, this is rather extraordinary.\" \"Sir?\" \"You know Twing Hall?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Well, Mr. Little is there.\" \"Indeed, sir?\" \"Absolutely in the flesh. He\u0027s had to take another of those tutoring jobs.\" After that fearful mix-up at Goodwood, when young Bingo Little, a broken man, had touched me for a tenner and whizzed silently off into the unknown, I had been all over the place, asking mutual friends if they had heard anything of him, but nobody had. And all the time he had been at Twing Hall. Rummy. And I\u0027ll tell you why it was rummy. Twing Hall belongs to old Lord Wickhammersley, a great pal of my guv\u0027nor\u0027s when he was alive, and I have a standing invitation to pop down there when I like. I generally put in a week or two some time in the summer, and I was thinking of going there before I read the letter. \"And, what\u0027s more, Jeeves, my cousin Claude, and my cousin Eustace—you remember them?\" \"Very vividly, sir.\" \"Well, they\u0027re down there, too, reading for some exam, or other with the vicar. I used to read with him myself at one time. He\u0027s known far and wide as a pretty hot coach for those of fairly feeble intellect. Well, when I tell you he got me through Smalls, you\u0027ll gather that he\u0027s a bit of a hummer. I call this most extraordinary.\" I read the letter again. It was from Eustace. Claude and Eustace are twins, and more or less[Pg 139] generally admitted to be the curse of the human race. The Vicarage, Twing, Glos. Dear Bertie—Do you want to make a bit of money? I hear you had a bad Goodwood, so you probably do. Well, come down here quick and get in on the biggest sporting event of the season. I\u0027ll explain when I see you, but you can take it from me it\u0027s all right. Claude and I are with a reading-party at old Heppenstall\u0027s. There are nine of us, not counting your pal Bingo Little, who is tutoring the kid up at the Hall. Don\u0027t miss this golden opportunity, which may never occur again. Come and join us. Yours, Eustace. I handed this to Jeeves. He studied it thoughtfully. \"What do you make of it? A rummy communication, what?\" \"Very high-spirited young gentlemen, sir, Mr. Claude and Mr. Eustace. Up to some game, I should be disposed to imagine.\" \"Yes. But what game, do you think?\" \"It is impossible to say, sir. Did you observe that the letter continues over the page?\" \"Eh, what?\" I grabbed the thing. This was what was on the other side of the last page: SERMON HANDICAP RUNNERS AND BETTING PROBABLE STARTERS. Rev. Joseph Tucker (Badgwick), scratch. Rev. Leonard Starkie (Stapleton), scratch. [Pg 140] Rev. Alexander Jones (Upper Bingley), receives three minutes. Rev. W. Dix (Little Clickton-in-the-Wold), receives five minutes. Rev. Francis Heppenstall (Twing), receives eight minutes. Rev. Cuthbert Dibble (Boustead Parva), receives nine minutes. Rev. Orlo Hough (Boustead Magna), receives nine minutes. Rev. J. J. Roberts (Fale-by-the-Water), receives ten minutes. Rev. G. Hayward (Lower Bingley), receives twelve minutes. Rev. James Bates (Gandle-by-the-Hill), receives fifteen minutes. (The above have arrived.) Prices.—5-2, Tucker, Starkie; 3-1, Jones; 9-2, Dix; 6-1, Heppenstall, Dibble, Hough; 100-8 any other. It baffled me. \"Do you understand it, Jeeves?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Well, I think we ought to have a look into it, anyway, what?\" \"Undoubtedly, sir.\" \"Right-o, then. Pack our spare dickey and a toothbrush in a neat brown-paper parcel, send a wire to Lord Wickhammersley to say we\u0027re coming, and buy two tickets on the five-ten at Paddington to-morrow.\" * * * * * The five-ten was late as usual, and everybody was dressing for dinner when I arrived at the Hall. It was only by getting into my evening things in record time and taking the stairs to the dining-room in a couple of bounds that I managed to dead-heat with[Pg 141] the soup. I slid into the vacant chair, and found that I was sitting next to old Wickhammersley\u0027s youngest daughter, Cynthia. \"Oh, hallo, old thing,\" I said. Great pals we\u0027ve always been. In fact, there was a time when I had an idea I was in love with Cynthia. However, it blew over. A dashed pretty and lively and attractive girl, mind you, but full of ideals and all that. I may be wronging her, but I have an idea that she\u0027s the sort of girl who would want a fellow to carve out a career and what not. I know I\u0027ve heard her speak favourably of Napoleon. So what with one thing and another the jolly old frenzy sort of petered out, and now we\u0027re just pals. I think she\u0027s a topper, and she thinks me next door to a looney, so everything\u0027s nice and matey. \"Well, Bertie, so you\u0027ve arrived?\" \"Oh, yes, I\u0027ve arrived. Yes, here I am. I say, I seem to have plunged into the middle of quite a young dinner-party. Who are all these coves?\" \"Oh, just people from round about. You know most of them. You remember Colonel Willis, and the Spencers——\" \"Of course, yes. And there\u0027s old Heppenstall. Who\u0027s the other clergyman next to Mrs. Spencer?\" \"Mr. Hayward, from Lower Bingley.\" \"What an amazing lot of clergymen there are round here. Why, there\u0027s another, next to Mrs. Willis.\" \"That\u0027s Mr. Bates, Mr. Heppenstall\u0027s nephew. He\u0027s an assistant-master at Eton. He\u0027s down here during the summer holidays, acting as locum tenens for Mr. Spettigue, the rector of Gandle-by-the-Hill.\" \"I thought I knew his face. He was in his fourth year at Oxford when I was a fresher. Rather a blood. Got his rowing-blue and all that.\" I took another look round the table, and spotted young[Pg 142] Bingo. \"Ah, there he is,\" I said. \"There\u0027s the old egg.\" \"There\u0027s who?\" \"Young Bingo Little. Great pal of mine. He\u0027s tutoring your brother, you know.\" \"Good gracious! Is he a friend of yours?\" \"Rather! Known him all my life.\" \"Then tell me, Bertie, is he at all weak in the head?\" \"Weak in the head?\" \"I don\u0027t mean simply because he\u0027s a friend of yours. But he\u0027s so strange in his manner.\" \"How do you mean?\" \"Well, he keeps looking at me so oddly.\" \"Oddly? How? Give an imitation.\" \"I can\u0027t in front of all these people.\" \"Yes, you can. I\u0027ll hold my napkin up.\" \"All right, then. Quick. There!\" Considering that she had only about a second and a half to do it in, I must say it was a jolly fine exhibition. She opened her mouth and eyes pretty wide and let her jaw drop sideways, and managed to look so like a dyspeptic calf that I recognised the symptoms immediately. \"Oh, that\u0027s all right,\" I said. \"No need to be alarmed. He\u0027s simply in love with you.\" \"In love with me. Don\u0027t be absurd.\" \"My dear old thing, you don\u0027t know young Bingo. He can fall in love with anybody.\" \"Thank you!\" \"Oh, I didn\u0027t mean it that way, you know. I don\u0027t wonder at his taking to you. Why, I was in love with you myself once.\" \"Once? Ah! And all that remains now are the cold ashes? This isn\u0027t one of your tactful evenings, Bertie.\" \"Well, my dear sweet thing, dash it all,[Pg 143] considering that you gave me the bird and nearly laughed yourself into a permanent state of hiccoughs when I asked you——\" \"Oh, I\u0027m not reproaching you. No doubt there were faults on both sides. He\u0027s very good-looking, isn\u0027t he?\" \"Good-looking? Bingo? Bingo good-looking? No, I say, come now, really!\" \"I mean, compared with some people,\" said Cynthia. Some time after this, Lady Wickhammersley gave the signal for the females of the species to leg it, and they duly stampeded. I didn\u0027t get a chance of talking to young Bingo when they\u0027d gone, and later, in the drawing-room, he didn\u0027t show up. I found him eventually in his room, lying on the bed with his feet on the rail, smoking a toofah. There was a notebook on the counterpane beside him. \"Hallo, old scream,\" I said. \"Hallo, Bertie,\" he replied, in what seemed to me rather a moody, distrait sort of manner. \"Rummy finding you down here. I take it your uncle cut off your allowance after that Goodwood binge and you had to take this tutoring job to keep the wolf from the door?\" \"Correct,\" said young Bingo tersely. \"Well, you might have let your pals know where you were.\" He frowned darkly. \"I didn\u0027t want them to know where I was. I wanted to creep away and hide myself. I\u0027ve been through a bad time, Bertie, these last weeks. The sun ceased to shine——\" \"That\u0027s curious. We\u0027ve had gorgeous weather in London.\" \"The birds ceased to sing——\" \"What birds?\" [Pg 144] \"What the devil does it matter what birds?\" said young Bingo, with some asperity. \"Any birds. The birds round about here. You don\u0027t expect me to specify them by their pet names, do you? I tell you, Bertie, it hit me hard at first, very hard.\" \"What hit you?\" I simply couldn\u0027t follow the blighter. \"Charlotte\u0027s calculated callousness.\" \"Oh, ah!\" I\u0027ve seen poor old Bingo through so many unsuccessful love-affairs that I\u0027d almost forgotten there was a girl mixed up with that Goodwood business. Of course! Charlotte Corday Rowbotham. And she had given him the raspberry, I remembered, and gone off with Comrade Butt. \"I went through torments. Recently, however, I\u0027ve—er—bucked up a bit. Tell me, Bertie, what are you doing down here? I didn\u0027t know you knew these people.\" \"Me? Why, I\u0027ve known them since I was a kid.\" Young Bingo put his feet down with a thud. \"Do you mean to say you\u0027ve known Lady Cynthia all that time?\" \"Rather! She can\u0027t have been seven when I met her first.\" \"Good Lord!\" said young Bingo. He looked at me for the first time as though I amounted to something, and swallowed a mouthful of smoke the wrong way. \"I love that girl, Bertie,\" he went on, when he\u0027d finished coughing. \"Yes. Nice girl, of course.\" He eyed me with pretty deep loathing. \"Don\u0027t speak of her in that horrible casual way. She\u0027s an angel. An angel! Was she talking about me at all at dinner, Bertie?\" \"Oh, yes.\" [Pg 145] \"What did she say?\" \"I remember one thing. She said she thought you good-looking.\" Young Bingo closed his eyes in a sort of ecstasy. Then he picked up the notebook. \"Pop off now, old man, there\u0027s a good chap,\" he said, in a hushed, far-away voice. \"I\u0027ve got a bit of writing to do.\" \"Writing?\" \"Poetry, if you must know. I wish the dickens,\" said young Bingo, not without some bitterness, \"she had been christened something except Cynthia. There isn\u0027t a dam\u0027 word in the language it rhymes with. Ye gods, how I could have spread myself if she had only been called Jane!\" * * * * * Bright and early next morning, as I lay in bed blinking at the sunlight on the dressing-table and wondering when Jeeves was going to show up with a cup of tea, a heavy weight descended on my toes, and the voice of young Bingo polluted the air. The blighter had apparently risen with the lark. \"Leave me,\" I said, \"I would be alone. I can\u0027t see anybody till I\u0027ve had my tea.\" \"When Cynthia smiles,\" said young Bingo, \"the skies are blue; the world takes on a roseate hue: birds in the garden trill and sing, and Joy is king of everything, when Cynthia smiles.\" He coughed, changing gears. \"When Cynthia frowns——\" \"What the devil are you talking about?\" \"I\u0027m reading you my poem. The one I wrote to Cynthia last night. I\u0027ll go on, shall I?\" \"No!\" \"No?\" \"No. I haven\u0027t had my tea.\" At this moment Jeeves came in with the good old[Pg 146] beverage, and I sprang on it with a glad cry. After a couple of sips things looked a bit brighter. Even young Bingo didn\u0027t offend the eye to quite such an extent. By the time I\u0027d finished the first cup I was a new man, so much so that I not only permitted but encouraged the poor fish to read the rest of the bally thing, and even went so far as to criticise the scansion of the fourth line of the fifth verse. We were still arguing the point when the door burst open and in blew Claude and Eustace. One of the things which discourage me about rural life is the frightful earliness with which events begin to break loose. I\u0027ve stayed at places in the country where they\u0027ve jerked me out of the dreamless at about six-thirty to go for a jolly swim in the lake. At Twing, thank heaven, they know me, and let me breakfast in bed. The twins seemed pleased to see me. \"Good old Bertie!\" said Claude. \"Stout fellow!\" said Eustace. \"The Rev. told us you had arrived. I thought that letter of mine would fetch you.\" \"You can always bank on Bertie,\" said Claude. \"A sportsman to the finger-tips. Well, has Bingo told you about it?\" \"Not a word. He\u0027s been——\" \"We\u0027ve been talking,\" said Bingo hastily, \"of other matters.\" Claude pinched the last slice of thin bread-and-butter, and Eustace poured himself out a cup of tea. \"It\u0027s like this, Bertie,\" said Eustace, settling down cosily. \"As I told you in my letter, there are nine of us marooned in this desert spot, reading with old Heppenstall. Well, of course, nothing is jollier than sweating up the Classics when it\u0027s a hundred in the shade, but there does come a time[Pg 147] when you begin to feel the need of a little relaxation; and, by Jove, there are absolutely no facilities for relaxation in this place whatever. And then Steggles got this idea. Steggles is one of our reading-party, and, between ourselves, rather a worm as a general thing. Still, you have to give him credit for getting this idea.\" \"What idea?\" \"Well, you know how many parsons there are round about here. There are about a dozen hamlets within a radius of six miles, and each hamlet has a church and each church has a parson and each parson preaches a sermon every Sunday. To-morrow week—Sunday the twenty-third—we\u0027re running off the great Sermon Handicap. Steggles is making the book. Each parson is to be clocked by a reliable steward of the course, and the one that preaches the longest sermon wins. Did you study the race-card I sent you?\" \"I couldn\u0027t understand what it was all about.\" \"Why, you chump, it gives the handicaps and the current odds on each starter. I\u0027ve got another one here, in case you\u0027ve lost yours. Take a careful look at it. It gives you the thing in a nutshell. Jeeves, old son, do you want a sporting flutter?\" \"Sir?\" said Jeeves, who had just meandered in with my breakfast. Claude explained the scheme. Amazing the way Jeeves grasped it right off. But he merely smiled in a paternal sort of way. \"Thank you, sir, I think not.\" \"Well, you\u0027re with us, Bertie, aren\u0027t you?\" said Claude, sneaking a roll and a slice of bacon. \"Have you studied that card? Well, tell me, does anything strike you about it?\" Of course it did. It had struck me the moment I looked at it. [Pg 148] \"Why, it\u0027s a sitter for old Heppenstall,\" I said. \"He\u0027s got the event sewed up in a parcel. There isn\u0027t a parson in the land who could give him eight minutes. Your pal Steggles must be an ass, giving him a handicap like that. Why, in the days when I was with him, old Heppenstall never used to preach under half an hour, and there was one sermon of his on Brotherly Love which lasted forty-five minutes if it lasted a second. Has he lost his vim lately, or what is it?\" \"Not a bit of it,\" said Eustace. \"Tell him what happened, Claude.\" \"Why,\" said Claude, \"the first Sunday we were here, we all went to Twing church, and old Heppenstall preached a sermon that was well under twenty minutes. This is what happened. Steggles didn\u0027t notice it, and the Rev. didn\u0027t notice it himself, but Eustace and I both spotted that he had dropped a chunk of at least half a dozen pages out of his sermon-case as he was walking up to the pulpit. He sort of flickered when he got to the gap in the manuscript, but carried on all right, and Steggles went away with the impression that twenty minutes or a bit under was his usual form. The next Sunday we heard Tucker and Starkie, and they both went well over the thirty-five minutes, so Steggles arranged the handicapping as you see on the card. You must come into this, Bertie. You see, the trouble is that I haven\u0027t a bean, and Eustace hasn\u0027t a bean, and Bingo Little hasn\u0027t a bean, so you\u0027ll have to finance the syndicate. Don\u0027t weaken! It\u0027s just putting money in all our pockets. Well, we\u0027ll have to be getting back now. Think the thing over, and phone me later in the day. And, if you let us down, Bertie, may a cousin\u0027s curse—— Come on, Claude, old thing.\" The more I studied the scheme, the better it looked. [Pg 149] \"How about it, Jeeves?\" I said. Jeeves smiled gently, and drifted out. \"Jeeves has no sporting blood,\" said Bingo. \"Well, I have. I\u0027m coming into this. Claude\u0027s quite right. It\u0027s like finding money by the wayside.\" \"Good man!\" said Bingo. \"Now I can see daylight. Say I have a tenner on Heppenstall, and cop; that\u0027ll give me a bit in hand to back Pink Pill with in the two o\u0027clock at Gatwick the week after next: cop on that, put the pile on Musk-Rat for the one-thirty at Lewes, and there I am with a nice little sum to take to Alexandra Park on September the tenth, when I\u0027ve got a tip straight from the stable.\" It sounded like a bit out of \"Smiles\u0027s Self-Help.\" \"And then,\" said young Bingo, \"I\u0027ll be in a position to go to my uncle and beard him in his lair somewhat. He\u0027s quite a bit of a snob, you know, and when he hears that I\u0027m going to marry the daughter of an earl——\" \"I say, old man,\" I couldn\u0027t help saying, \"aren\u0027t you looking ahead rather far?\" \"Oh, that\u0027s all right. It\u0027s true nothing\u0027s actually settled yet, but she practically told me the other day she was fond of me.\" \"What!\" \"Well, she said that the sort of man she liked was the self-reliant, manly man with strength, good looks, character, ambition, and initiative.\" \"Leave me, laddie,\" I said. \"Leave me to my fried egg.\" * * * * * Directly I\u0027d got up I went to the phone, snatched Eustace away from his morning\u0027s work, and instructed him to put a tenner on the Twing flier at current odds for each of the syndicate; and after[Pg 150] lunch Eustace rang me up to say that he had done business at a snappy seven-to-one, the odds having lengthened owing to a rumour in knowledgeable circles that the Rev. was subject to hay-fever, and was taking big chances strolling in the paddock behind the Vicarage in the early mornings. And it was dashed lucky, I thought next day, that we had managed to get the money on in time, for on the Sunday morning old Heppenstall fairly took the bit between his teeth, and gave us thirty-six solid minutes on Certain Popular Superstitions. I was sitting next to Steggles in the pew, and I saw him blench visibly. He was a little, rat-faced fellow, with shifty eyes and a suspicious nature. The first thing he did when we emerged into the open air was to announce, formally, that anyone who fancied the Rev. could now be accommodated at fifteen-to-eight on, and he added, in a rather nasty manner, that if he had his way, this sort of in-and-out running would be brought to the attention of the Jockey Club, but that he supposed that there was nothing to be done about it. This ruinous price checked the punters at once, and there was little money in sight. And so matters stood till just after lunch on Tuesday afternoon, when, as I was strolling up and down in front of the house with a cigarette, Claude and Eustace came bursting up the drive on bicycles, dripping with momentous news. \"Bertie,\" said Claude, deeply agitated, \"unless we take immediate action and do a bit of quick thinking, we\u0027re in the cart.\" \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"G. Hayward\u0027s the matter,\" said Eustace morosely. \"The Lower Bingley starter.\" \"We never even considered him,\" said Claude. \"Somehow or other, he got overlooked. It\u0027s[Pg 151] always the way. Steggles overlooked him. We all overlooked him. But Eustace and I happened by the merest fluke to be riding through Lower Bingley this morning, and there was a wedding on at the church, and it suddenly struck us that it wouldn\u0027t be a bad move to get a line on G. Hayward\u0027s form, in case he might be a dark horse.\" \"And it was jolly lucky we did,\" said Eustace. \"He delivered an address of twenty-six minutes by Claude\u0027s stop-watch. At a village wedding, mark you! What\u0027ll he do when he really extends himself!\" \"There\u0027s only one thing to be done, Bertie,\" said Claude. \"You must spring some more funds, so that we can hedge on Hayward and save ourselves.\" \"But——\" \"Well, it\u0027s the only way out.\" \"But I say, you know, I hate the idea of all that money we put on Heppenstall being chucked away.\" \"What else can you suggest? You don\u0027t suppose the Rev. can give this absolute marvel a handicap and win, do you?\" \"I\u0027ve got it!\" I said. \"What?\" \"I see a way by which we can make it safe for our nominee. I\u0027ll pop over this afternoon, and ask him as a personal favour to preach that sermon of his on Brotherly Love on Sunday.\" Claude and Eustace looked at each other, like those chappies in the poem, with a wild surmise. \"It\u0027s a scheme,\" said Claude. \"A jolly brainy scheme,\" said Eustace. \"I didn\u0027t think you had it in you, Bertie.\" \"But even so,\" said Claude, \"fizzer as that sermon no doubt is, will it be good enough in the face of a four-minute handicap?\" [Pg 152] \"Rather!\" I said. \"When I told you it lasted forty-five minutes, I was probably understating it. I should call it—from my recollection of the thing—nearer fifty.\" \"Then carry on,\" said Claude. I toddled over in the evening and fixed the thing up. Old Heppenstall was most decent about the whole affair. He seemed pleased and touched that I should have remembered the sermon all these years, and said he had once or twice had an idea of preaching it again, only it had seemed to him, on reflection, that it was perhaps a trifle long for a rustic congregation. \"And in these restless times, my dear Wooster,\" he said, \"I fear that brevity in the pulpit is becoming more and more desiderated by even the bucolic churchgoer, who one might have supposed would be less afflicted with the spirit of hurry and impatience than his metropolitan brother. I have had many arguments on the subject with my nephew, young Bates, who is taking my old friend Spettigue\u0027s cure over at Gandle-by-the-Hill. His view is that a sermon nowadays should be a bright, brisk, straight-from-the-shoulder address, never lasting more than ten or twelve minutes.\" \"Long?\" I said. \"Why, my goodness! you don\u0027t call that Brotherly Love sermon of yours long, do you?\" \"It takes fully fifty minutes to deliver.\" \"Surely not?\" \"Your incredulity, my dear Wooster, is extremely flattering—far more flattering, of course, than I deserve. Nevertheless, the facts are as I have stated. You are sure that I would not be well advised to make certain excisions and eliminations? You do not think it would be a good thing to cut, to prune? I might, for example, delete the rather[Pg 153] exhaustive excursus into the family life of the early Assyrians?\" \"Don\u0027t touch a word of it, or you\u0027ll spoil the whole thing,\" I said earnestly. \"I am delighted to hear you say so, and I shall preach the sermon without fail next Sunday morning.\" * * * * * What I have always said, and what I always shall say, is, that this ante-post betting is a mistake, an error, and a mug\u0027s game. You never can tell what\u0027s going to happen. If fellows would only stick to the good old S.P. there would be fewer young men go wrong. I\u0027d hardly finished my breakfast on the Saturday morning, when Jeeves came to my bedside to say that Eustace wanted me on the telephone. \"Good Lord, Jeeves, what\u0027s the matter, do you think?\" I\u0027m bound to say I was beginning to get a bit jumpy by this time. \"Mr. Eustace did not confide in me, sir.\" \"Has he got the wind up?\" \"Somewhat vertically, sir, to judge by his voice.\" \"Do you know what I think, Jeeves? Something\u0027s gone wrong with the favourite.\" \"Which is the favourite, sir?\" \"Mr. Heppenstall. He\u0027s gone to odds on. He was intending to preach a sermon on Brotherly Love which would have brought him home by lengths. I wonder if anything\u0027s happened to him.\" \"You could ascertain, sir, by speaking to Mr. Eustace on the telephone. He is holding the wire.\" \"By Jove, yes!\" I shoved on a dressing-gown, and flew downstairs like a mighty, rushing wind. The moment I[Pg 154] heard Eustace\u0027s voice I knew we were for it. It had a croak of agony in it. \"Bertie?\" \"Here I am.\" \"Deuce of a time you\u0027ve been. Bertie, we\u0027re sunk. The favourite\u0027s blown up.\" \"No!\" \"Yes. Coughing in his stable all last night.\" \"What!\" \"Absolutely! Hay-fever.\" \"Oh, my sainted aunt!\" \"The doctor is with him now, and it\u0027s only a question of minutes before he\u0027s officially scratched. That means the curate will show up at the post instead, and he\u0027s no good at all. He is being offered at a hundred-to-six, but no takers. What shall we do?\" I had to grapple with the thing for a moment in silence. \"Eustace.\" \"Hallo?\" \"What can you get on G. Hayward?\" \"Only four-to-one now. I think there\u0027s been a leak, and Steggles has heard something. The odds shortened late last night in a significant manner.\" \"Well, four-to-one will clear us. Put another fiver all round on G. Hayward for the syndicate. That\u0027ll bring us out on the right side of the ledger.\" \"If he wins.\" \"What do you mean? I thought you considered him a cert. bar Heppenstall.\" \"I\u0027m beginning to wonder,\" said Eustace gloomily, \"if there\u0027s such a thing as a cert. in this world. I\u0027m told the Rev. Joseph Tucker did an extraordinarily fine trial gallop at a mothers\u0027 meeting over at Badgwick yesterday. However, it seems our only chance. So-long.\" [Pg 155] Not being one of the official stewards, I had my choice of churches next morning, and naturally I didn\u0027t hesitate. The only drawback to going to Lower Bingley was that it was ten miles away, which meant an early start, but I borrowed a bicycle from one of the grooms and tooled off. I had only Eustace\u0027s word for it that G. Hayward was such a stayer, and it might have been that he had showed too flattering form at that wedding where the twins had heard him preach; but any misgivings I may have had disappeared the moment he got into the pulpit. Eustace had been right. The man was a trier. He was a tall, rangy-looking greybeard, and he went off from the start with a nice, easy action, pausing and clearing his throat at the end of each sentence, and it wasn\u0027t five minutes before I realised that here was the winner. His habit of stopping dead and looking round the church at intervals was worth minutes to us, and in the home stretch we gained no little advantage owing to his dropping his pince-nez and having to grope for them. At the twenty-minute mark he had merely settled down. Twenty-five minutes saw him going strong. And when he finally finished with a good burst, the clock showed thirty-five minutes fourteen seconds. With the handicap which he had been given, this seemed to me to make the event easy for him, and it was with much bonhomie and goodwill to all men that I hopped on to the old bike and started back to the Hall for lunch. Bingo was talking on the phone when I arrived. \"Fine! Splendid! Topping!\" he was saying. \"Eh? Oh, we needn\u0027t worry about him. Right-o, I\u0027ll tell Bertie.\" He hung up the receiver and caught sight of me. \"Oh, hallo, Bertie; I was just talking to Eustace. It\u0027s all right, old man.[Pg 156] The report from Lower Bingley has just got in. G. Hayward romps home.\" \"I knew he would. I\u0027ve just come from there.\" \"Oh, were you there? I went to Badgwick. Tucker ran a splendid race, but the handicap was too much for him. Starkie had a sore throat and was nowhere. Roberts, of Fale-by-the-Water, ran third. Good old G. Hayward!\" said Bingo affectionately, and we strolled out on to the terrace. \"Are all the returns in, then?\" I asked. \"All except Gandle-by-the-Hill. But we needn\u0027t worry about Bates. He never had a chance. By the way, poor old Jeeves loses his tenner. Silly ass!\" \"Jeeves? How do you mean?\" \"He came to me this morning, just after you had left, and asked me to put a tenner on Bates for him. I told him he was a chump and begged him not to throw his money away, but he would do it.\" \"I beg your pardon, sir. This note arrived for you just after you had left the house this morning.\" Jeeves had materialised from nowhere, and was standing at my elbow. \"Eh? What? Note?\" \"The Reverend Mr. Heppenstall\u0027s butler brought it over from the Vicarage, sir. It came too late to be delivered to you at the moment.\" Young Bingo was talking to Jeeves like a father on the subject of betting against the form-book. The yell I gave made him bite his tongue in the middle of a sentence. \"What the dickens is the matter?\" he asked, not a little peeved. \"We\u0027re dished! Listen to this!\" I read him the note: [Pg 157] The Vicarage, Twing, Glos. My Dear Wooster,—As you may have heard, circumstances over which I have no control will prevent my preaching the sermon on Brotherly Love for which you made such a flattering request. I am unwilling, however, that you shall be disappointed, so, if you will attend divine service at Gandle-by-the-Hill this morning, you will hear my sermon preached by young Bates, my nephew. I have lent him the manuscript at his urgent desire, for, between ourselves, there are wheels within wheels. My nephew is one of the candidates for the headmastership of a well-known public school, and the choice has narrowed down between him and one rival. Late yesterday evening James received private information that the head of the Board of Governors of the school proposed to sit under him this Sunday in order to judge of the merits of his preaching, a most important item in swaying the Board\u0027s choice. I acceded to his plea that I lend him my sermon on Brotherly Love, of which, like you, he apparently retains a vivid recollection. It would have been too late for him to compose a sermon of suitable length in place of the brief address which—mistakenly, in my opinion—he had designed to deliver to his rustic flock, and I wished to help the boy. Trusting that his preaching of the sermon will supply you with as pleasant memories as you say you have of mine, I remain, Cordially yours, F. Heppenstall. P.S.—The hay-fever has rendered my eyes unpleasantly weak for the time being, so I am dictating this letter to my butler, Brookfield, who will convey it to you. [Pg 158] I don\u0027t know when I\u0027ve experienced a more massive silence than the one that followed my reading of this cheery epistle. Young Bingo gulped once or twice, and practically every known emotion came and went on his face. Jeeves coughed one soft, low, gentle cough like a sheep with a blade of grass stuck in its throat, and then stood gazing serenely at the landscape. Finally young Bingo spoke. \"Great Scott!\" he whispered hoarsely. \"An S.P. job!\" \"I believe that is the technical term, sir,\" said Jeeves. \"So you had inside information, dash it!\" said young Bingo. \"Why, yes, sir,\" said Jeeves. \"Brookfield happened to mention the contents of the note to me when he brought it. We are old friends.\" Bingo registered grief, anguish, rage, despair and resentment. \"Well, all I can say,\" he cried, \"is that it\u0027s a bit thick! Preaching another man\u0027s sermon! Do you call that honest? Do you call that playing the game?\" \"Well, my dear old thing,\" I said, \"be fair. It\u0027s quite within the rules. Clergymen do it all the time. They aren\u0027t expected always to make up the sermons they preach.\" Jeeves coughed again, and fixed me with an expressionless eye. \"And in the present case, sir, if I may be permitted to take the liberty of making the observation, I think we should make allowances. We should remember that the securing of this headmastership meant everything to the young couple.\" \"Young couple! What young couple?\" \"The Reverend James Bates, sir, and Lady[Pg 159] Cynthia. I am informed by her ladyship\u0027s maid that they have been engaged to be married for some weeks—provisionally, so to speak; and his lordship made his consent conditional on Mr. Bates securing a really important and remunerative position.\" Young Bingo turned a light green. \"Engaged to be married!\" \"Yes, sir.\" There was a silence. \"I think I\u0027ll go for a walk,\" said Bingo. \"But, my dear old thing,\" I said, \"it\u0027s just lunch-time. The gong will be going any minute now.\" \"I don\u0027t want any lunch!\" said Bingo. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3042/84052.html","bookId":1032,"book":{"id":1032,"title":"The Inimitable Jeeves","description":"简介： Good morning, sir, said Jeeves.
