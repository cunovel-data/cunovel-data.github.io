Breathless and laughing, she stopped and braced her hand along the back of the sofa. \"Oh, come on, Rush, you’ve got to be home!\"\\n\\n A quick check of the rooms told her he wasn’t. The minute she’d been free, Lindy had hurried out of the Boeing offices, dying to tell Rush that the job was hers. The money was great. More than great. Wonderful. Health insurance, paid vacations, sick leave. And ten days off at Christmas. The whole nine yards – or was that ten? She didn’t know. What she did know was that this wonderful, fabulous job was hers.\\n\\n She couldn’t have asked for a better position. The woman who would be her supervisor had taken Lindy around to meet her co-workers and everyone had been so nice, so friendly. Lindy had known almost immediately that she was going to fit right in.\\n\\n \"Rush,\" she called out again, in case she’d missed him somehow.\\n\\n His name fell emptily into the silence. Oh well, he’d hear her good news soon enough. She went into her bedroom and changed into jeans and a soft pink ten-button Henley shirt, pushing the three-quarter length sleeves up past her elbows. She reached for her purse and as an afterthought scribbled Rush a note that said she was going out to buy thick T-bones, and when she got back they would celebrate.\\n\\n By the time Lindy returned from the Pike Place Market, Rush was on the lanai and the barbecue was smoking.\\n\\n \"Hi,\" she called out, and set the grocery bag on the counter. \"I got the job.\"\\n\\n \"I didn’t doubt for a minute that you would.\"\\n\\n Rush looked wonderfully relaxed in casual slacks and a light blue sweater that set off the color of his eyes to a clear cornflower blue. The sun glinted through his dark hair, and when he turned to smile at her, his face fairly danced with happy mischief, as if he’d known all along she’d do well and was as pleased as she that she had gotten the job. And exceedingly proud.\\n\\n \"Well, you might have shared some of that confidence with me,\" Lindy told him with mock disgust. \"In case you didn’t notice, I was a wreck this morning. Imagine leaving two hours before an interview.\" She could chide herself about it now, but she’d felt as if an army of red ants had decided to use her stomach as a place to dig their farm.\\n\\n \"I was confident enough to buy a bottle of champagne to celebrate,\" he informed her, moving into the kitchen and opening the fridge. He brought out the bottle and set it on the counter with all the ceremony and flair of a wine steward.\\n\\n \"Oh Rush, we can’t drink this,\" she whispered, reverently examining the bottle. This wasn’t the normal cheap champagne Lindy was used to drinking at Christmastime, but an expensive French variety, decorated with a gold seal and a fancy blue ribbon.\\n\\n \"Why not?\" His brows shot up.\\n\\n \"It’s too good---I mean, I can’t even pronounce the name of it.\" She tried, her tongue stumbling over the French vowels. In high school she’d taken a couple of years of the language, but she could never be considered fluent.\\n\\n \"You can’t say champagne?\" His voice dipped with sarcasm while tiny pinpricks of light shimmered in the depths of his eyes.\\n\\n \"Oh stop. You’re being deliberately obtuse.\"\\n\\n Already he’d peeled away the decorative top foil. \"If anyone has reason to celebrate, it’s you.\"\\n\\n Lindy sighed and nodded, utterly content. \"I can’t tell you how pleased I am.\"\\n\\n \"You don’t need to,\" he teased. \"Anyone within a five-block radius could feel your happiness.\" His gaze held hers briefly before he dragged it away and started working to remove the cork.\\n\\n Lindy felt strangely breathless and dizzy with joy. She was truly happy, when only a few weeks before she’d doubted that she’d ever experience elation or excitement again. Now she felt as though destiny had finally caught up with her again, and she was riding the crest of a wave, surging ahead, grabbing at every good thing that came her way. And lately, since she’d met Rush, there seemed to be so much to feel good about.\\n\\n The sound of the cork popping and the bubbly liquid spraying into the sink caused Lindy to gasp, then giggle.\\n\\n \"Here, here,\" she cried, handing Rush one of the tall narrow glasses he’d set out. She didn’t want any of this precious liquid to be wasted. God only knew how much Rush had paid for the bottle.\\n\\n \"A toast,\" Rush said, handing her a glass and taking his own. Tiny golden bubbles popped to the surface as if to add their own congratulations. \"To Lindy Kyle, computer expert,\" Rush murmured, completely serious.\\n\\n \"I’m not really an expert.\"\\n\\n \"Are you always this argumentative, woman?\"\\n\\n \"All right, all right,\" she laughed and licked the moisture from her fingertips. \"IBM owes everything to me. Mr. Wang himself calls me his friend.\" Her eyes were laughing, her joy and enthusiasm exuding with every breath, because it was impossible to contain them.\\n\\n \"Mr. Wang?\" Rush asked her. \"What about Mr. Callaghan? Is he your friend?\"\\n\\n \"Oh most assuredly. The very best kind there is.\"\\n\\n \"Good.\"\\n\\n Lindy thought his voice sounded slightly husky, pleased, but before she had time to analyze it or study him further, Rush poised his glass next to hers. Gently they tapped the delicate rims together and Lindy tasted a sample. The smooth liquid was wonderfully light and mellow and so delicious that she closed her eyes to properly savor it.\\n\\n \"This is marvelous stuff,\" she said, taking another sip.\\n\\n \"I thought you’d like it.\"\\n\\n \"I bought us steaks,\" she said, suddenly remembering the sack. \"And enough vegetables to open our own fifty-item salad bar.\"\\n\\n Rush chuckled. \"You get the salad together and I’ll manage the steaks.\"\\n\\n \"That sounds like a workable plan.\"\\n\\n \"Good grief,\" he chided, unwrapping the thick T-bones from the white butcher paper. \"You’re already using office lingo.\"\\n\\n Lindy resisted the urge to swat his backside as he returned to the lanai, and turned her attention to the variety of fresh vegetables for the salad.\\n\\n She finished before Rush did, and taking her champagne glass with her, joined him outside. It had rained for part of the week, but the sun was out this afternoon and the breeze was fresh and clean.\\n\\n \"The coals aren’t quite hot enough yet,\" he told her, leaning against the wrought-iron railing, looking at ease with himself and his world.\\n\\n Perhaps it was the champagne or the fact she’d stood too long in the sun. Lindy wasn’t sure which to blame. But standing beside Rush she suddenly felt the overwhelming need to have him kiss her, the overpowering desire to glide her moist lips back and forth over his and taste the champagne on his tongue.\\n\\n \"Lindy?\" He was frowning at her, and for a moment she was sure he’d read her thoughts. \"What is it?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing.\" She shook her head for emphasis, pushing down the impulse. It was insane, stupid, wrong. And yet something kept driving her. Something primitive and completely unmanageable. Before she could change her mind, she took both their wineglasses and set them aside, her hands shaking.\\n\\n Rush watched her like a man in a trance.\\n\\n She leaned forward and planted her hands on his shoulders, her intense gaze holding his.\\n\\n At her touch, she felt a quiver work its way through his lean, hard body. He stiffened, his shoulders at attention as though a visiting admiral were passing by for inspection. But still he didn’t try to stop her, didn’t gently push her away as she thought he might. His hands bunched into tight fists at his sides.\\n\\n Filled with purpose, and more determined than she had been about anything in a long time, Lindy stood on tiptoe and briefly touched her lips to his.\\n\\n It was better than she’d thought, better than she’d dreamed. She cocked her head so their noses wouldn’t present a barrier and kissed him again. Lightly. Tentatively. Shyly.\\n\\n Rush stood stiff and motionless, but a low moan slipped from deep within his throat. His dark eyebrows cramped his piercing blue eyes, and he glared at her. If he hoped to intimidate her with a look, he failed. Lindy felt incredibly brave, ready to take on a fully armed armada if need be. Surely managing one weary sailor wouldn’t be so difficult.\\n\\n Rush closed his eyes then opened them, searching her face, his look tormented. He seemed to be telling Lindy to stop. Begging her to move away from him because he hadn’t the will to move himself. But Lindy had no intention of following his silent demand.\\n\\n None. Instead she smiled boldly up at him, her heart in her eyes.\\n\\n Rush claimed her lips then, and groaned anew as if holding her were the last thing in the world he wanted to do. His mouth clung to hers, warm and demanding as his tongue plundered the dark, sweet secret of her mouth, taking all that she offered.\\n\\n His hands pulled her tight against him and he continued to kiss her again and again until she was flushed and trembling and her blood felt as if it could boil.\\n\\n \"Oh God, Lindy. No. No. This isn’t right.\" His voice was tortured and barely audible. But still he didn’t release her.\\n\\n Chapter Five\\n\\n Rush’s face was hard. Harder than at any time Lindy could remember. His eyebrows were pulled down over his eyes, which were busily searching her face, seeking answers she couldn’t give him.\\n\\n Gently, his hands at her waist, he broke her hold on him and turned away, but not too far, because she was able to view his profile in the afternoon sunlight. He sucked in a giant breath and savagely jerked his fingers through his hair, his face dark and ravaged with what looked like guilt and regret.\\n\\n \"Rush,\" she whispered. \"Listen – \"\\n\\n \"No, you listen---\"\\n\\n The same mindless force that had driven her to kiss him led her now, and she moved behind him, wrapping her arms around his torso and fiercely hugging his back. She could feel the coiled resistance in him, but refused to release him.\\n\\n \"Lindy, damn it, you’re not making this easy.\" His hands moved to break her hold and release himself from the trap of her arms.\\n\\n At least Lindy thought that was his intent. But instead his fingers closed over her knuckles, squeezing her hands together with such force she nearly gasped with pain. But when his hand touched hers something seemed to snap inside him and he relaxed, causing her to melt all the more intimately against him.\\n\\n She was shocked by how good Rush’s body felt. He was tall and lean and hard and he stirred some inherent need in her.\\n\\n An eternity passed before either moved. They hardly seemed to breathe. Lindy would have held onto Rush until the Second Coming if he hadn’t broken free of her clasp and moved away from her. His breath was choppy then, as though it had cost him a great deal to leave her arms. His intense blue eyes stubbornly avoided hers.\\n\\n \"I think it would be best if we forget that ever happened,\" he said gruffly, and seemed to be engrossed in placing the steaks on the barbecue.\\n\\n \"I’m not going to forget it.\" Lindy didn’t know why she felt she had to argue with him, but she did. \"I thought you were the one who was so keen on us being honest with each other.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/navy-wife-navy-1/page-9.html","bookId":1956,"book":{"id":1956,"title":"Navy Wife (Navy #1)","description":"Storyline: Navy Wife (Navy Series #1) \\n Impulsive, wounded, vulnerable, Lindy Kyle was unprepared for a roommate like Rush Callaghan.
