{"id":68958,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"Lindy had already downed two thick mugs of ale and was feeling the dizzying, warm effects of the alcohol. Rarely had she tasted better pizza, and she’d pigged down three enormous slices, astonishing them both. Now she felt content and happy, two states of mind that had been sadly lacking in her life recently. \"If there was a big enough floor space, I’d want to dance,\" she told Rush, who instantly looked relieved – no doubt because he’d chosen a restaurant without one. Lindy giggled. \"What’s so funny?\" \"You!\" \"I’m glad you find me so amusing.\" \"Don’t take it personally. It’s just that it feels so good to sit back and relax like this.\" \"That amuses you?\" \"Yes, because you look like you’ve just been granted a pardon from the governor because you don’t have to dance. And something else.\" His dark brows shot up. \"There’s more?\" \"Oh yes. For the first time since we met, I don’t feel I have to keep my wits sharpened around you.\" She said it with a smile, hoping her good mood would cut any sting from her words. \"In case you didn’t know it, Rush Callaghan, you can be one hell of an arrogant jerk. Imagine posting a schedule to use the bathroom!\" His eyes narrowed, his jaw clenched in mock consternation, and still he looked every inch the sturdy, capable naval officer she knew him to be. \"There are a few truths about yourself I could enlighten you with as well, Lindy Kyle.\" \"Perhaps,\" she conceded. He was teasing her and Lindy found herself warming to him. When he chose to, Rush could freeze out an Eskimo with one piercing glare. She hated to think of the men on the Mitchell facing his wrath because, although she hadn’t seen it in full force, she’d witnessed enough to know his anger would be formidable. Discovering this gentler, fun-loving side of his nature had been an unexpected surprise. Still smiling, Rush stood and threw a couple of dollars onto the table. \"Come on, let’s get out of here before someone pushes aside a few tables and starts up a band.\" Lindy laughed and reached for her sweater and purse. Rush’s hand lightly touched the small of her back as he guided her out of the restaurant. \"So you really aren’t going to take me dancing?\" she asked, once they were outside in the cool June air. \"Not on your life.\" Lindy released a slow, expressive sigh and glanced up into the dark, warmth of his gaze. A small taste of excitement filled her, and some of the heavy feeling that had weighted her heart for so many interminable weeks lifted. \"Would the lady consider a walk instead?\" Rush said, his voice oddly tender, indulgent. He lifted his hand and rested it against her shoulder, his touch amazingly light. Lindy had the impression that he’d rather not have his hand where it was, but that he couldn’t help himself, and she waded through a surge of elation. It was marvelous to feel like a woman again, and she was highly aware of her power, however fleeting. They strolled toward the busy Seattle waterfront, weaving in and out of the crowds that lingered on the sidewalk. The air was clean and fresh, smelling of tangy salt and seaweed, and although the sun had set, the gentle breeze carried with it a pleasing warmth. Rush bought them coffee from a seafood bar and they silently walked along the pier, staring at the lights from the ferryboat as it glided across the murky green waters of Puget Sound. \"Can I see the Mitchell from here?\" Lindy asked. \"No. It’s in the shipyard in Bremerton, which is all the way across the Sound.\" \"You really love the sea, don’t you?\" Rush’s fingers momentarily tightened their grip on her shoulder. \"Yes, I do. Did Steve ever tell you I was born on a ferryboat?\" \"No.\" \"I think my destiny was cast then. My mother named me Rush because they were hurrying to get her to the hospital in time. Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how one chooses to look at it, I was born on the water.\" \"And have been at home there ever since,\" she added in a soft whisper. He nodded and their eyes met in a brief exchange of rare understanding. Rush continued talking, telling her a little of his youth and his early days at Annapolis. He made a striking figure, leaning against the edge of the pier, Lindy noted. He paused and smiled down at her. His eyes narrowed briefly with appreciation and it was as if they had become two different people for this one special night. Rush looked younger, Lindy mused, more open. For the first time since she’d arrived in Seattle, she felt that she was beginning to appreciate this complex man. Maybe because he was really talking to her, sharing a small part of himself with her. There was no pretense between them tonight. Somehow Lindy realized how rare it was for Rush to expose this amiable, sensitive part of himself, to let down his guard and throw caution to the wind. She felt as though she’d been granted a rare gift, one that she would look back on years from now and treasure. They left the pier a few minutes later, discarded their Styrofoam cups and continued strolling down the busy sidewalk until they reached Waterfront Park. Lindy braced her foot against the bottom stair, which led to an observation deck and a museum on the second level. \"It’s a beautiful night,\" Rush commented, staring into the sky. Lindy had the feeling he was about to suggest they head back to the apartment. She didn’t want the evening to end. Everything was too perfect for them to leave so soon. \"Come on. I’ll race you up the stairs,\" she called, letting the breeze carry her challenge. Not waiting to see if he was going to follow her, she grabbed for the railing and hurled herself up the concrete steps, taking two at a time. The wind, which had recently picked up, whipped her hair from her face as she made a mad dash up the stairway, doing her best to swallow her laughter. \"Lindy.\" Rush’s exasperated voice was directly behind her, and not wishing to be outdistanced, she lurched forward. He beat her easily and was waiting for her, blocking her way when she breathlessly reached the top. \"You little fool.\" Still panting and laughing, she tried to leap around him but almost lost her balance. A look of horror crowded his face as he reached out to grab her, but Lindy quickly darted in the opposite direction. Rush tried to block her there, as well, and she shrieked with the sheer joy of the moment and scooted sideways from him. \"Lindy, stop.\" She dodged to her left and when he followed her, she darted to her right, then triumphantly stumbled past him, running to the railing, her eyes wild with joy. \"I won,\" she declared triumphantly, swinging around to face him. Rush collapsed on the park bench, barely winded. \"You cheated.\" \"Oh, honestly. Can’t you admit it when a woman outsmarts you?\" \"I’d admit it if it was true.\" \"My foot, you would.\" Lindy slumped down on the bench beside him, her breath coming in uneven, shallow gasps. Good Lord, she was out of shape. She let her head fall back so her hair rushed away from her face, granting her a feeling of complete freedom. Lindy exhaled, dragging the oxygen through her lungs. \"Oh, Paul, I can’t remember a night when I’ve had more fun.\" The instant the name slipped through her lips, Lindy tensed. \"I meant… Rush.\" The excitement that had galloped through her blood just seconds before felt like a deadweight pressing against her chest. For one crazy moment she was paralyzed. She had trouble breathing, trouble moving, trouble thinking. Scalding tears burned in her eyes, and the huge lump in her throat felt as if it were monumental. Moisture rolled down the side of her face, burning her skin like acid, and she sucked in a trembling sob. \"Lindy, are you all right?\" Rush brushed away a tear and his finger felt incredibly warm against her icy cold cheek. \"Something must have gotten into my eye,\" she lied, turning away so he wouldn’t be able to see the extent of her emotion. \"Here.\" He pressed a white handkerchief into her numb fingers, and she made a quick job of wiping her face dry. \"I think we should be heading back. Don’t you?\" \"Anything you say.\" He sounded so concerned when it was the last thing she wanted. Suddenly Rush was the last person in the world she yearned to be with. Escape seemed of paramount importance. Somehow she found her way to her feet, although the cement seemed to buckle beneath her shoes. With some effort she managed to keep her balance and rush away from the bench. It would have been too much to hope that Rush would let her go. But oddly enough he seemed to appreciate her mood, remaining silent as he matched his quick steps to hers. Side by side they started up the hill toward First Avenue. The climb was steep and Lindy was winded by the time they’d gone only a few blocks. \"1*11 get a taxi,\" Rush said. \"No. Don’t, please.\" She wanted to walk – needed to wear herself out physically so she could collapse in her bed exhausted. It was the only way she could guarantee she would sleep. The simple act of putting one foot in front of the other, climbing up one street and then the next one, seemed to help her contain her emotions. By the time they reached the apartment building, Lindy’s lungs ached and her calf muscles violently protested the strenuous exercise. She waited impatiently while Rush unlocked the front door. He held it open for her, and in that moment she detested him for the small display of manners. Paul had impeccable manners and look what he’d done to her. Look what he’d reduced her to. Without even glancing in Rush’s direction she paused just inside the living room and said, her voice weak and faltering, \"Thank you for dinner.\" He didn’t answer her for what seemed an eternity, and she had the impression he was willing her to turn around and face him. But she knew she couldn’t without dissolving into wretched emotion. \"Anytime, Lindy.\" His words were low and as smooth as velvet. \"Good night.\" The sooner she got away from Rush the better. \"‘Night.\" Again his voice was so gentle, so tender. She made it all the way to the bathroom door before her gaze blurred so badly with tears that she had to stop and wipe the moisture from her eyes. Drawing in several steadying breaths between clenched teeth gave her some relief. She’d be damned before she’d cry over Paul Abrams. Damned. Damned. Damned. Without being aware of how it happened, Lindy found that she had stopped and braced a shoulder against the wall, using it to keep her upright, needing its support. She pinched her nose with her thumb and index fingers, willing back the release of torrential tears. \"Lindy, you need to cry.\" The words seemed to come from a far distance, echoing around her in a canyon of despair. She dropped her hand and looked up to find Rush standing beside her. \"No,\" she said forcefully. \"I won’t.\" \"Don’t let him do this to you.\" She tried to push Rush away, but her effort was puny and weak. \"You don’t know anything,\" she cried. \"How could you?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/navy-wife-navy-1/page-6.html","bookId":1956,"book":{"id":1956,"title":"Navy Wife (Navy #1)","description":"Storyline: Navy Wife (Navy Series #1) Impulsive, wounded, vulnerable, Lindy Kyle was unprepared for a roommate like Rush Callaghan.
