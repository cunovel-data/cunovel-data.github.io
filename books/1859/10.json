{"id":81628,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"When I finally look at the clock, I notice it\u0027s been seven hours since I ran out on Emily and my feelings. As I look out in front of me, the gray asphalt blurring with yellow and white lines, I make the decision to keep going. I don\u0027t want to be the one to ruin her.\n No matter how far I drive, I come to the same conclusion over and over again. I must have given Emily some sign of my feelings for her. It was never my intention. I\u0027m a stock boy at a grocery store. She needs someone to take care of her...buy her all the things she\u0027s never had. She doesn\u0027t need an orphaned schmuck with less money than common sense.\n Usually, forty-eight hours doesn\u0027t seem like a whole lot. However, it\u0027s the longest I\u0027ve been away from Emily in the time I\u0027ve known her. It\u0027s hard for me to believe I\u0027ve only known her such a short time because she\u0027s my whole life. How can your whole life be consumed by one person you haven\u0027t known your entire life?\n Since I don\u0027t know the answer to that, I keep driving.\n It\u0027s Friday the 13th. I hadn\u0027t actually realized it until I stopped for gas, and the lady in front of me was writing a check. She asked what the date was. The attendant answered her in a gleeful, yet macabre tone. Can one celebrate Friday the 13th? If today is the thirteenth though, that means I\u0027ve been sleeping in my car for six days.\n Six days without her beautiful eyes.\n Six days without hearing the slight lilt in her voice.\n Six days since she told me she loved me, and I left her - like a thief in the night. Six days of thinking about kissing, touching and holding Emily. It\u0027s the only thing I\u0027ve thought about.\n Suddenly, it hits me: I know exactly what the raccoon from yesterday felt like as the wheels of the truck ahead of me rolled over him crushing him from the outside in.\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vacant/page-10.html","bookId":1859,"book":{"id":1859,"title":"Vacant","description":"Storyline: \n Ethan Parker gets up every day, surviving the only way he knows how - alone.

When a young woman moves in next door, Ethan is forced to reevaluate his beliefs. He tries to keep his distance, but his new neighbor\u0027s infectious smile and outlook on life leave him struggling with the decision of living the life he knows, or taking a chance on the unexpected.
