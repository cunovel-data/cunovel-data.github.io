{"id":81620,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"I\u0027m staring, which is something I don\u0027t make a habit of. Eye contact typically invites people into conversations, and I\u0027m not a fan of chit-chat. I stand in the doorway with an awkward pause, like I\u0027m unfamiliar with waving as an appropriate means to say hello. My pause before I answer her is a pace too long, and the situation is somewhat uncomfortable as I stand there waiting for her to offer up more information. More importantly, I want to know why she\u0027s knocking on my door, and I hope it\u0027s not so we can get to know each other.\n Since several more seconds pass without further exchange, I finally cave in and offer myself up. \"Hey, I\u0027m Ethan,\" I say wanting to keep it simple. I don\u0027t want to get sucked into a conversation with her, but I don\u0027t want to be rude, either. She can tell I\u0027m a little put out with her presence, so she gets right to the point. The last thing I need is an overly perky neighbor who thinks we\u0027re \"pals.\"\n \"Sorry, I was just having trouble getting a window open. It\u0027s going to be a hot one, you know, and I don\u0027t have the electricity turned on yet. They want some freaking deposit since I don\u0027t have a credit history. It\u0027s like, \u0027Hello, I\u0027m living in a crappy house, in a crappy neighborhood. If I had good credit, I wouldn\u0027t be living here.\u0027 Anyway, I want to get the window open to get air moving through, and I think it\u0027s painted shut. I don\u0027t want to be all \u0027damsel in distress,\u0027 but I can\u0027t pry the darn thing open...\"\n My thoughts trail off and I realize this is the most anyone has said to me in years. Perky girl is still talking, but I\u0027m continuously distracted by her mere presence and the fact that her chest spills over the top of her tank. She\u0027s pretty cute, but I try not to dwell on her appearance as lustful thoughts won\u0027t lead anywhere good.\n \"So you think you could come help me?\" I know I missed some information in there, but I\u0027m not going to ask for clarification or for her to repeat it.\n \"Sure, no problem.\"\n I follow behind her, but at a safe distance. I don\u0027t want the offer of my help and me being polite to some girl mistaken for flirting. It sounds conceited, but it\u0027s happened before. It\u0027s better not to give them any sense of false hope. I mind my own business and live my life; today will be no exception. She shows me the window in question, and sure enough, it\u0027s painted shut. I roll my eyes at the incredibly inept and lazy maintenance people for doing a half-assed paint job.\n \"Um, I\u0027ll be right back. I\u0027ll have to get something to cut this open.\" I turn to head out her front door, but she stops me.\n \"Oh, wait. Like a box cutter? I have one of those. I think the maintenance people left it here by mistake.\" She rummages in a kitchen drawer then presents me with a paint covered box knife. As I work the window, she asks me several questions related to the area. My answers are succinct since I\u0027m not really receptive to the Getting-to-Know-You game. The \"Twenty Questions\" moderator doesn\u0027t get the hint though, and keeps on with the game. \"So, how long have you lived here?\"\n \"A few years.\"\n \"Do you know many of the neighbors?\"\n \"I don\u0027t talk to the neighbors much, so I don\u0027t know anything about them.\" I\u0027m hopeful my continued shortness helps her get the hint that I\u0027m not interested in a conversation.\n \"Wow, you\u0027re pretty quiet, huh?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"So, what do you do for fun?\"\n I\u0027m caught off guard by her question. I can\u0027t recall when I\u0027ve had fun, so I\u0027m not sure how to respond. I stand up straight, rolling my shoulders back and craning my neck in a stretch, attempting to buy a little time for my answer. While I don\u0027t particularly care what this girl thinks of me, I don\u0027t want to come off like a total loser, either.\n \"Look, I\u0027m sorry,\" she says. \"I didn\u0027t mean to pry. I\u0027ve bothered you enough this morning. You\u0027ve been so nice, helping me out and all. I\u0027m gonna...\" she trails off and I go back to working the window, popping it open a few seconds later.\n \"I\u0027ll see you around,\" I tell her, raising the window to its fully open state. She quickly dismisses me with another small wave, and I leave to go back to my own little corner of the earth. Despite the fact that I\u0027ve been in her unit for less than five minutes, it doesn\u0027t escape my notice that there\u0027s no furniture or a TV, just a mattress on the floor of her bedroom. Maybe the moving truck with her stuff hasn\u0027t arrived yet, I think to myself. In the back of my mind, I know there isn\u0027t more stuff coming. People like us don\u0027t have stuff or the need for moving trucks.\n I\u0027m lying in bed, thinking about the stupid question she asked me. \"What do you do for fun?\" How could such a simple question send me into a tailspin?\n That\u0027s when I hear a whimper. It\u0027s been a while since anyone\u0027s lived next door, and the last guy who lived there was never home, so I\u0027m used to quiet. The walls are thin in apartments like this, cheaply built and economically priced rental units. Much expense was spared in their construction. I\u0027m certain we share no more than a few two-by-fours and two slabs of sheetrock as the wall. It doesn\u0027t provide any more privacy than that found between bedrooms in the same home instead of two separate residences. I turn my head, thinking it will improve my ability to discern what I think I\u0027m hearing. It doesn\u0027t, but then I hear muted sobbing. That can only mean one thing - new neighbor girl is crying. I turn away, wanting the sound to stop; I don\u0027t want to be involved.\n The next morning shows no signs of life from my neighbor, but that\u0027s no surprise. The noise coming from her side of the duplex kept me up well into the night, so I\u0027m sure she\u0027s sleeping in. I, on the other hand, take part in my free exercise routine - running. I do this early in the morning for two reasons: one, I avoid those who may feel the need to hassle me for money. They are not early risers, as hassling is a mid-morning and post-lunch activity. Two, it gets hot as fuck here in the summer, and running in 105 degree temperatures is just stupid.\n I crest the hill on my street, nearly completing my three miles, and see her setting out the trash. New girl is looking around nervously, probably in hopes of going undetected since she\u0027s barely dressed in her tiny shorts and tank top. It\u0027s not leaving a whole hell of a lot to the imagination, and my mind wanders as I catch a glimpse at her ass. I see her throw a couple of empty boxes to the curb then turn and rush inside. I\u0027m close enough that I can see the blackened bottoms of her feet as she scurries inside, then wonder how often she goes without shoes.\n A few days pass before I see her again as I return from my run. This time she\u0027s leaving a few plastic grocery sacks out for the trash. Once again, she\u0027s dressed in the same tank and shorts she wore on Sunday. After my cool down stretch, I make my way inside and gather my things to shower. Only then does it occur to me that I haven\u0027t heard the water turn on in neighbor girl\u0027s unit at any point since she moved in, not even a toilet flush. The only sound I hear from her side of the wall is the crying each night. I recall her statement about not having electricity. I\u0027m guessing she doesn\u0027t have the water turned on yet, either.\n A knot forms in my stomach.\n Don\u0027t get involved. Keep things simple. Take care of yourself!\n I can\u0027t help it and walk out my door, knocking on hers seconds later. It takes a moment before I realize I\u0027m only wearing my shorts, but it\u0027s too late. She opens the door a crack and eyes me.\n \"Ethan,\" she greets, and then opens the door a little wider, looking around cautiously.\n \"Emily, right?\"\n \"Yeah. What\u0027s up?\" She\u0027s smiling again, just like when we met.\n \"I noticed that you, um...don\u0027t have electricity yet, and you don\u0027t have water either, huh?\" She bites the inside of her cheek nervously.\n \"No.\" Her reply is so small, just like she is, and I can tell she\u0027s embarrassed.\n \"Come on,\" I say, motioning for her to follow me. \"You can shower and wash your clothes at my place. I pay a flat fee for the water, so you using it won\u0027t cost me any more money.\"\n Don\u0027t get involved. Keep things simple. Take care of yourself!\n It\u0027s too late, though. I\u0027m already involved. It\u0027s no longer simple, and for the first time ever, I\u0027m offering to care for someone other than myself. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vacant/page-2.html","bookId":1859,"book":{"id":1859,"title":"Vacant","description":"Storyline: \n Ethan Parker gets up every day, surviving the only way he knows how - alone.
