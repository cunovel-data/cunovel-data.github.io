{"id":81627,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"The words are ringing in my ears: \"I love you.\"\\n\\n It occurs to me I may have misheard. It\u0027s the only possible explanation.\\n\\n \"So, you\u0027re okay? Don\u0027t listen to those girls, Emily.\" I\u0027ll just pretend those three little words aren\u0027t hanging in the air - regardless of whether they were actually said.\\n\\n \"Ethan, did you hear what I just said?\"\\n\\n What do I say? I have no idea how to approach this, so I just stare at her wide-eyed.\\n\\n After a few moments, I feel warmth creeping up my thigh and realize its Emily\u0027s hand. At first, it\u0027s an attempt to get my attention, but as her hand ascends, I realize the intent is not so innocent.\\n\\n \"We have to go. It\u0027s time to go,\" I say, stilted, like Rain Man talking about his Kmart underwear.\\n\\n I grip the steering wheel for dear life because if I don\u0027t, the car and my life will go careening into the abyss. I\u0027ve spent all this time convincing myself that Emily and I could never be anything but friends. Knowing that she may feel the same about me as I feel about her will complicate things, and I suddenly feel trapped.\\n\\n It\u0027s so quiet as we drive, that I hear a small plinking that would go unnoticed otherwise, but as I near the duplex, the sound the car is making increases. I briefly wonder if it\u0027s because the plink is getting worse or the quiet is just so intense. I make a mental note to find the origin of the plinking before putting too many more miles on the car.\\n\\n I should be thinking about the woman sitting next to me and her recent declaration instead of small pings, but I\u0027m not... I can\u0027t.\\n\\n If I do... no.\\n\\n I can\u0027t think.\\n\\n I\u0027m not even sure how I get here, but I\u0027m sitting in the middle of my bed, having an argument with myself.\\n\\n It\u0027s no surprise that I\u0027m winning.\\n\\n \"She told you she loves you.\"\\n\\n \"She says she loves to cook. She loves lots of things.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s in there and you\u0027re in here.\"\\n\\n \"You really need to clean the ceiling fan blades.\"\\n\\n I can\u0027t help but roll my eyes at myself.\\n\\n When I finally exit my room, the apartment is dark and quiet. Emily is asleep on the couch with a tight grip on the blankets. Little does she know she\u0027s gripping at my heart the same way.\\n\\n The notebook on the side table catches my eye, and I can\u0027t help but snoop. As I near it, I see there are several wads of paper strewn across the floor - discarded because they weren\u0027t perfect. The top piece, still clinging to life in its spiral bindings, is flawless.\\n\\n Dear Ethan -\\n\\n Sitting down to write this, I\u0027ve never felt more like a young girl than I do right now. For the past two years, I\u0027ve looked at you every day in hopes that someday - you\u0027d feel for me, what I feel for you. But now I see that we perceive different things regarding our relationship. Maybe it could be classified on my part as hero worship, but I\u0027d like to think I\u0027m smarter than that. I think I know the difference between infatuation and love.\\n\\n I know there is a difference in our ages, but who cares? My heart has no idea how old your heart is. I just know that if I don\u0027t tell you, it will fester inside me, and I\u0027ll die a slow painful death. I\u0027ve only ever loved my mom and never really knew what it was like to care for another person until I met you.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t fall in love with you that first day, but after many months of learning to appreciate your care and concern, I could see how kind your soul - your whole being is. That\u0027s when I knew another kind of love existed. It isn\u0027t the type of love between family members, or a crush, but a true love that is unconditional and lasting, a love that I can no longer hide.\\n\\n I know you probably don\u0027t return these feelings, but I couldn\u0027t go another second without you knowing. I understand if it makes you uncomfortable, and I\u0027ll find another place to live if you feel like we can no longer be friends.\\n\\n Love always,\\n\\n Emily\\n\\n I tightly clutch the notebook page in my hand.\\n\\n How can she do this to me?\\n\\n Doesn\u0027t she know what she\u0027s done?\\n\\n No... it\u0027s not right.\\n\\n Not now, and without any further thoughts, I\u0027m out the door. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vacant/page-9.html","bookId":1859,"book":{"id":1859,"title":"Vacant","description":"Storyline: Ethan Parker gets up every day, surviving the only way he knows how - alone.
