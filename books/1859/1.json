{"id":81619,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"I grew up in a small house in a lower-class neighborhood, just my dad and me. My old man worked a blue-collar job with shit benefits. I can\u0027t complain too much though, because I never went hungry and always had a roof over my head.\\n\\n No, my dad didn\u0027t hug me every night or read bedtime stories by the glow of a nightlight, but he fed me, clothed me, and didn\u0027t knock me around. That\u0027s more than some of my friends had, so I was grateful. I hadn\u0027t known then, growing up, that there was anything more in life to want.\\n\\n I was fifteen when my father left just after dinner to buy a pack of cigarettes. He never came home.\\n\\n My dad was shot in a convenience store parking lot after he gave the wrong guy the wrong look. He walked down to get some smokes and didn\u0027t take his wallet, just five bucks for the cheapest pack he could get. He was shot at point-blank range, no cigarettes or money found on his person.\\n\\n He was listed as a John Doe at the morgue. There was no burial and no identity when he moved from this life to the next.\\n\\n I was on my own for a week before anyone realized I was alone. I was smart enough to keep my mouth shut, to get up and go to school every day. I figured I had at least three or four months before a bill collector came knocking, but the nosy bitch across the street hadn\u0027t seen the old man in a week and was \"worried.\"\\n\\n That\u0027s when I began my life in the system. It\u0027s not like on TV; when you\u0027re an orphan in an after school special, they ship your ass off to a relative and everyone lives happily ever after. In real life, though, if you don\u0027t have family that wants you - or family at all, you become a ward of the state. Sure, they have foster homes and pretend families that some kids get to live with, but there are a shit-ton of homeless kids and few foster families available. Many foster parents are in it for the money, so they aren\u0027t exactly the best option, either. Typically, you\u0027re stuck in a group home with other kids in the same messed up situation as you and a revolving door of caregivers. However, I had a bed to sleep in, clothes on my back, and I was not a victim of abuse. It wasn\u0027t all that different from living with my dad.\\n\\n At eighteen, Children\u0027s Services kicked my ass out. There were lots of kids to take care of and not a lot of money. Luckily, I\u0027d gotten a job at a grocery store as a bag boy at sixteen and began saving. I wasn\u0027t stupid or naive enough to think the state was going to take care of me forever. I was fortunate enough to have graduated from high school before I got the boot; some kids had to worry about finishing school in addition to being homeless.\\n\\n My father told me many times I couldn\u0027t depend on anyone but myself, and I never realized how right he was before the day I was truly on my own.\\n\\n With my savings in hand and a promotion to stock-boy, I got my first place. It was the cheapest place I could find in a neighborhood without bars on the windows. It was small and dirty, but it was mine. There weren\u0027t gunshots whizzing by my windows or the sounds of screaming every night, so I wasn\u0027t about to look a gift horse in the mouth.\\n\\n My life hasn\u0027t changed much in the past three years. I get up every morning, walk to the grocery store, clock in, work a ten hour shift, clock out, come home, mind my own business, and do it again the next day.\\n\\n I don\u0027t have friends because they create lots of complications and drama. I spend my time at work smiling at the customers and doing my job. Co-workers ask me out from time to time, but the truth is I don\u0027t have extra money to have a few beers with the guys or take a girl on a date. I\u0027m always careful with my rejection. There\u0027s no sense in hurting anyone\u0027s feelings when it\u0027s not necessary. Plus, it would lead to questions I\u0027m not willing to answer.\\n\\n I\u0027m sitting alone at my thrift store kitchen table, staring down at a day-old cookie. It\u0027s my twenty-first birthday today. I don\u0027t have any plans, and there are no cards in my mailbox. I\u0027m having dessert for breakfast, a treat to myself, and I\u0027m thankful for what little I have.\\n\\n It\u0027s sad as hell, but I don\u0027t have any candles so I light a match and jam it in the middle of the damn cookie. I don\u0027t even make a wish before I blow out the tiny flame so it doesn\u0027t burn down and ruin my treat.\\n\\n No sooner than the flame\u0027s gone out, there\u0027s a knock at my door. I look at my dollar store wall clock and see it\u0027s only nine. I can\u0027t imagine who would be at my door this early on a Saturday morning. Most of my neighbors sleep in after a late Friday night.\\n\\n Even though I\u0027m twenty-one, I tend to think of myself as more mature than most people my age, so when I open the door and see a girl, petite and fragile in appearance, I automatically think she\u0027s young. She may even be my age, maybe younger, but my experience makes me feel like I\u0027m over thirty, so she seems like a girl to me.\\n\\n She\u0027s standing there smiling as if she doesn\u0027t have a care in the world, obviously not knowing people around here don\u0027t smile. I peer at her through the ripped screen of my front door as the heat and humidity of the day filters in.\\n\\n \"Hey, what\u0027s up? I\u0027m Emily. I just moved in next door.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vacant/page-1.html","bookId":1859,"book":{"id":1859,"title":"Vacant","description":"Storyline: Ethan Parker gets up every day, surviving the only way he knows how - alone.
