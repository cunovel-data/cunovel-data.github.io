{"id":81630,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"I knock, but there\u0027s no answer. I let myself in and I\u0027m immediately relieved to see Emily\u0027s things still around the house, including her bedding on the couch. Remorse creeps back into my chest as I think about the numerous times I\u0027ve tried to convince Emily to take my room - my bed - but she never has. I kneel down on the floor in front of the sofa to worship the scent lingering in the sheets. She always smells like baby powder, the cheap off brand they sell at the Dollar Tree, but regardless of the price, it smells like heaven to me. I close my eyes and enjoy her essence while also promising myself to buy her name-brand lotion. No more generic. The shouting startles me awake. \"I don\u0027t care! Get the mother-fucking money. I don\u0027t pay you to lose my shit!\" Then I hear the unmistakable sound of a fist meeting flesh. My blood runs cold as I wonder if it\u0027s Emily next door. The thought hits me like the fist from next door: What has she done to get money for herself? I\u0027ve had many neighbors while I\u0027ve lived here. It\u0027s to be expected, as the downtrodden are a transient population. That unit was empty when....when I left, so I hadn\u0027t thought about a new tenant. I also hadn\u0027t figured on undesirables moving in. I\u0027d never worried about my safety, but now I have to think of Emily\u0027s safety and protection. This is no place for her. I hear a feminine scream amid the sounds of skin being struck and I know it\u0027s not my girl. I know what her scream sounds like after a spider infestation and that\u0027s not it. It\u0027s not Emily. \"Get up, Punta!\" I hear more ramblings and shouts in Spanish; the female cries in response. All I can think is, Thank God it\u0027s not Emily. But it is someone - someone\u0027s daughter, sister, or friend. I do the only thing I can. I call the police and let them handle it. While I\u0027ve read heroic tales of men saving the day, it\u0027s not safe or practical in this case. It\u0027s very likely that the monster next door has a weapon, and I\u0027m no good to protect Emily if I\u0027m dead. The cops come and go quickly. The woman refuses to press charges, but the man is escorted off the property with a warning not to return. He\u0027ll be back, though. They always are. My thoughts drift to moving to a better neighborhood, but then I realize I may not have a job because I\u0027m a complete coward who left for a week without calling his boss; it\u0027ll be a miracle if I\u0027m not fired. How will I take care of Emily without a job? I\u0027m an idiot. God, how did I fuck this up so badly? I dial Margie\u0027s number and her cheerful greeting relaxes me a bit. \"Hey, Marge, it\u0027s Ethan.\" \"Well hey, Sugarplum. How was your vacation?\" She knows I wasn\u0027t on vacation, and I try to discern if there is sarcasm in her voice, but I can\u0027t seem to detect any. \"Margie, I wasn\u0027t on vacation.\" \"Sure you were, kid. It\u0027s on the schedule; I approved it myself. There\u0027s paperwork and everything. The owners are glad you finally took some time off. You had more than three weeks coming to you. It makes them nervous that you\u0027ve never taken a day off in five years.\" I\u0027m confused and my silence must confirm this to my manager. \"So, are you coming in tomorrow? I\u0027m down a cashier and could use ya.\" Cashier? I\u0027m a \"back of the house\" guy. The \"make sure there\u0027s always chips on the display\" guy; low man on the grocery store food chain. \"Uhhhh...\" is my incoherent reply. \"It\u0027s time you take on more responsibility, kiddo. You have that pretty girl to take care of.\" She knows. She knows about Emily. How does she know? \"I\u0027ll see you tomorrow, Ethan.\" I\u0027m left holding the phone wondering what the hell is going on.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vacant/page-12.html","bookId":1859,"book":{"id":1859,"title":"Vacant","description":"Storyline: Ethan Parker gets up every day, surviving the only way he knows how - alone.
