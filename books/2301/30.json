I ate a quick bowl of cereal for breakfast, brushed my teeth, then grabbed my handbag and my keys and drove to the store.\n It was ten after ten when I arrived. Almost on time.\n I was surprised to see Cagin come into the shop later that day. He wore a pair of tight jeans and a black T-shirt that emphasized his muscular torso. Amazingly, he looked none the worse from last night\u0027s brawl. It really was remarkable, the way the Supernatural creatures healed. I imagined there must be doctors in hidden labs all over the world trying to discover the secret ingredient to the recuperative powers of the Werewolves and the Vampires. Anyone who could bottle it would soon be rich beyond their wildest dreams.\n “What are you doing in here?” I glanced out the front window, praying that someone else would come into the shop. After last night, Cagin was the last person in the world I wanted to be alone with.\n “I came for a book, what else?”\n “I don\u0027t know.” I shrugged, grateful for the counter between us, even though I was pretty sure he could leap across it with no trouble at all. “I guess I just didn\u0027t expect to see you.”\n “Hey, I\u0027m sorry about last night. Things got a little out of hand, that\u0027s all.”\n “A little out of hand? Right.”\n “We\u0027re all on edge these days, what with that new hunter in town, although I don\u0027t imagine he\u0027ll last long. Or the other one, either. Mara or Clive will see to that.”\n “Two hunters,” I repeated. “Right.” Travis Jackson had mentioned there was another hunter in town, but he\u0027d refused to divulge the man\u0027s name. Cagin had no such qualms.\n “Jackson and McGee—damn their eyes.”\n “Rick McGee?” I shook my head. “You must be mistaken.”\n “We can\u0027t afford to be mistaken about things like that.”\n It couldn\u0027t be true. If Rick was a hunter…the possibility of what that might mean to Susie\u0027s future was frightening. But surely Rick wouldn\u0027t kill his own wife! Even as I tried to reassure myself, I knew Rick wouldn\u0027t have to. Travis Jackson would destroy her without a moment\u0027s hesitation.\n I had to call Susie, I thought desperately. I had to warn her before it was too late, but what could I say? How could I convince her that her life might be in danger from her own husband?\n I didn\u0027t think Cagin was ever going to leave but, finally, he picked out a couple of sci-fi books and left the store. As soon as he was gone, I grabbed the phone and punched in Susie\u0027s number. After four rings, her answering machine picked up.\n “Hi, this is the McGees\u0027 home. We can\u0027t get to the phone right now, but you know what to do. Ta-ta for now.”\n I broke the connection. Just because she didn\u0027t answer the phone didn\u0027t mean she was in danger. She could have gone to visit her kids again or run to the market. Maybe she\u0027d gone for a walk…and maybe she was lying dead in a ditch somewhere.\n As the day went on, I tried her number half a dozen times, until I wanted to scream in frustration.\n I was thinking of closing up at five when I was suddenly inundated with customers all clamoring for the latest installment of the young adult series titled Ghost Wind. Written by a nineteen-year-old boy, bookstores all over the country were touting it as the next Harry Potter.\n For the first time since I\u0027d opened the store, I was praying for customers to leave. Instead, they seemed determined to hang around, exchanging stories of how Ghost Wind had turned their nonreaders into fanatics. I listened, I rang up sales, I bagged books, and all the time I was silently screaming at them all to go home so I could lock up.\n It was almost six when I ushered the last customer out the door and turned out the lights. I was locking up when Rafe appeared. I\u0027d never been so glad to see any body in my life.\n “What\u0027s wrong?” he asked.\n “Susie doesn\u0027t answer her phone.”\n He lifted one brow. “That\u0027s what has you so upset?”\n “Is that why you\u0027re here? You knew I was upset?”\n He nodded, sniffed the air, and then frowned. “Cagin was here.”\n “He came in to buy a book. He told me there are two hunters in town, and that Susie\u0027s husband is one of them! I\u0027ve been calling her house all day, and she doesn\u0027t answer. You don\u0027t think he\u0027d…” I couldn\u0027t say the words aloud.\n Rafe rubbed a hand over his jaw. “It\u0027s possible.”\n “You know something. What? Tell me?”\n “My grandfather and I followed McGee the other night. He met up with Jackson.”\n I stared at him, my heart pounding with dread. “And?”\n “Jackson asked McGee if he could take her out, or if he wanted Jackson to do it.”\n “I don\u0027t believe it! How can they expect Rick to kill her! How can Rick even associate with someone crazy enough to expect him to kill his own wife! It\u0027s…it\u0027s insane!”\n “All the hunters I\u0027ve known are dedicated to destroying the Supernatural. They take a blood oath to do their duty or die trying.”\n “I can\u0027t believe you didn\u0027t tell me this before!”\n “I don\u0027t want you involved in this.”\n “I\u0027m already involved. Susie\u0027s my friend.” I grabbed Rafe\u0027s arm. “We\u0027ve got to stop them before it\u0027s too late.”\n “I\u0027ll see if I can find her. You stay here.”\n “No! I\u0027m going with you.”\n He shook his head. “Not a chance. These guys are killers. If you get in their way, they won\u0027t hesitate to kill you, too. You got that?” He slipped his arm around my shoulders and gave me a squeeze. “For all you know, she could be at the movies.” He kissed my cheek. “Stay here,” he said again. “I\u0027ll be back as soon as I can.”\n I grabbed his arm. “I need to go. If you won\u0027t take me with you, then I\u0027ll…I\u0027ll…”\n “You\u0027ll what?”\n “I\u0027ll find someone who will. Someone like…Cagin.”\n Rafe glared at me. I knew he was trying to intimidate me, but I refused to back down.\n “Dammit, Kathy…”\n “We\u0027re wasting time.”\n With a shake of his head, he stalked out of the building.\n I turned off the lights, locked the door, and followed him outside, half expecting that he would be gone. But he was leaning against the front fender of his car, waiting for me.\n I told myself not to worry, that if anyone could find Susie, it was Rafe. After all, he\u0027d done it before.\n But I couldn\u0027t shake the feeling that something terrible was about to happen.\n Chapter Twenty\n I gazed out the window as Rafe drove up and down the streets of Oak Hollow. I was counting on him to find Susie, but as it turned out, I was the one who found her, in a roundabout sort of way.\n We had been searching for over an hour and were about to give up and go back to my place when I sensed the presence of a Were.\n “Slow down.” I glanced up and down the street. “Over there.”\n Rafe pulled up in front of the house I indicated. A large FOR SALE sign hung from a post in a corner of the yard. A smaller sign read VACANT. I thought I recognized Susie\u0027s car in the driveway.\n I glanced at Rafe. If it was Susie\u0027s car, what would she be doing here, in the dark, in an empty house? I was surprised at the number of ghastly possibilities that quickly flitted through my mind, each one worse than the last.\n “I\u0027m going inside to have a look around,” Rafe said. “Any point in my telling you to wait here?”\n “Probably not.”\n “Stay behind me.”\n I didn\u0027t have any problem with that. I followed him up the walkway to the front porch, waited while he listened a moment, then tried the doorknob.\n It opened at his touch.\n Apparently, he didn\u0027t need an invitation to enter a vacant house. He crossed the threshold on silent feet, and I tiptoed in behind him, my heart pounding as I glanced around. I couldn\u0027t see much, but even in the darkness, I could see that the room was empty.\n Rafe stood just inside the doorway for a moment, then moved unerringly through the living room and down a narrow hallway, with me close on his heels.\n There was the sound of a scuffle followed by a sharp cry that was quickly cut off, but not before it lifted the short hairs along my nape. The scent of blood brought the taste of bile to the back of my throat.\n Rafe stepped through a doorway to the left, then glanced at me over his shoulder. “Stay there.”\n His tone left no room for argument, so I waited until he moved farther into the room before I peeked around the door frame.\n And wished I hadn\u0027t.\n There were no curtains on the windows. In the faint light cast by a streetlamp, I saw Susie sitting on the floor, her back against the wall, her expression stricken. A thin ribbon of red marred her throat. It took me a minute to realize it was blood.\n Her husband lay sprawled on his back at her feet, a gaping hole where his throat had been. A large knife with a wicked-looking silver blade lay on the floor beside him.\n Cagin, wearing only a pair of jeans, stood beside the body. His yellow eyes were glowing. Blood was splattered across his chest and stained the corners of his mouth.\n “What happened here?” Rafe asked.\n It was Cagin who answered. “He brought her here to kill her. I couldn\u0027t let that happen.”\n Cagin had saved Susie\u0027s life…. I frowned, remembering the night outside Susie\u0027s house. Maybe the look on his face hadn\u0027t been anger, as I had supposed, but worry. Or affection.\n I stepped into the doorway. “You were protecting her the other night, too, weren\u0027t you?”\n “Maybe.”\n “And you were going to shift and go after her, weren\u0027t you? Only Rafe\u0027s grandfather beat you to it, and then Rafe showed up…. You didn\u0027t want to fight him, did you? You were just angry because we interfered.”\n Rafe glared at me. “What the hell are you talking about?” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-master-children-of-the-night-3/page-30.html","bookId":2301,"book":{"id":2301,"title":"Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3) \n Passion Has a Darker Side... \n Kathy McKenna was sure that the little Midwestern town of Oak Hollow would be isolated enough for safety, but the moment the black-clad stranger walked into her bookstore, she knew she was wrong.
