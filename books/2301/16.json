My good sense tells me that I shouldn\u0027t have anything to do with you, but…” “But?” I took a deep breath and let it out in a long, slow sigh. “I can\u0027t stand the thought of never seeing you again.” “It could be dangerous for you.” “I know.” “It doesn\u0027t scare you?” “Of course it does.” “You\u0027ve nothing to fear from me, you know that, don\u0027t you?” “It\u0027s not you I\u0027m afraid of. It\u0027s what\u0027s happening in Oak Hollow. It\u0027s knowing, really knowing, that Vampires and Were-creatures and…and witches…actually exist. I mean, I knew it before I moved here, but I had never met any Supernatural folk. I told myself they didn\u0027t really exist. But now…” “Now you can\u0027t pretend anymore.” I nodded. “I\u0027m afraid for you, afraid of how all this trouble between the Vampires and Werewolves will end.” “Come here.” Rising from my chair, I went into his arms. “You don\u0027t have to worry about me,” he said, his fingertips stroking my arm. “I can take care of myself. And you, too.” I hoped he was right, but only time would tell. Resting my head on his shoulder, I closed my eyes. The future would take care of itself. Right now, I was where I most wanted to be. “This won\u0027t be easy,” Raphael murmured, his breath warm against my neck. “I know.” “For your sake, we\u0027d better take it slow.” I kissed his cheek. “Slow.” He turned his head, his lips seeking mine, his tongue like a flame as it dueled with my own. For a moment, I lost myself in his touch, thinking how amazing it was that he was here, that I was in his arms. “Rafe…” He drew back a little, his gaze seeking mine. “You want me to stop?” “No, I…”Might as well just say it, I thought, then blurted, “I think I love you.” “I think I love you, too.” “This complicates things even more, doesn\u0027t it?” I asked. Lust and love were two different animals. Lust was a selfish beast. It had no responsibilities, implied no lasting commitment, no concern for the other\u0027s happiness or welfare. But love, ah, love required caring and commitment, it meant putting another\u0027s wants and needs before one\u0027s own. Lust was fleeting; true love lasted forever. “In a way,” Raphael agreed, kissing the tip of my nose. “On the other hand, it\u0027s nice to know where we stand.” Drawing me into his arms once more, he lowered his head and kissed me again and yet again, each kiss deeper and more intimate than the last. His hands moved lightly over my body, as if he wanted to memorize every curve. Had I been a cat, I would have arched my back and purred with pleasure. As it was, I couldn\u0027t restrain the soft moans that rose in my throat as he caressed me, nor could I resist an exploration of my own. I loved the feel of his skin beneath my hands, the way his muscles bunched and quivered at my touch. I lay back on the sofa and drew him down on top of me, basking in the feel of his body lying atop mine, the heat of his arousal pressing against my thigh. I was lost in the taste of him, the touch of him, until I felt his fangs at my throat. It cooled my desire as quickly as cold water doused a fire. “Raphael?” Muttering an oath, he rolled off me and gained his feet. I sat up, staring at his back, watching as he raked a hand through his hair, then curled his hands into tight fists at his sides. He was breathing heavily. A leftover remnant of his desire, I wondered, or a sign of his hunger? “Rafe…?” He lifted one hand. “Give me a minute.” I grew increasingly nervous as I sat there watching him. Was he subduing his hunger or getting ready to pounce? Only moments ago, he had warned me that our relationship could be dangerous for me. I glanced around the room, seeking a way out, seeking a weapon. I found neither. Raphael stood between me and the front door, blocking my only exit. My chance of finding a weapon seemed equally slim since I didn\u0027t keep a ready supply of holy water or hawthorn stakes on hand. And even if I did, there was no way I could have used either one on Rafe. That fact alone told me I was in far deeper than I\u0027d thought. A shudder ran through his entire body and then, slowly, he turned to face me, his expression a little sheepish as his gaze met mine. “I\u0027m sorry,” he said. “I should have warned you.” “Warned me? About what?” “With us, the urge to make love and the urge to feed are strongly connected. For us, the taking of blood enhances our emotions and our pleasure.” “Oh.” Once again, I had learned more than I really wanted to know. “The idea repulses you?” “I don\u0027t know about that, but it doesn\u0027t thrill me.” I wondered how his mother had handled it before she was turned. Had she let Rafe\u0027s father drink from her? Dared I ask? Did I really want to know? “Kathy…I don\u0027t want to lose you….” My heart squeezed painfully in my chest as I waited for him to go on. I had a feeling I wasn\u0027t going to like what he was about to say. “I thought we could make this work, but…” He shook his head. “I\u0027d never intentionally hurt you, but…dammit, what if I can\u0027t help myself? Just now I wanted to taste you, and I was close to taking what I wanted, so close…” “But you didn\u0027t.” “What if I can\u0027t stop myself next time?” “I don\u0027t know.” Maybe he was right. Maybe we shouldn\u0027t see each other anymore, yet even as the thought crossed my mind, I knew it wasn\u0027t what I wanted. Right or wrong, for better or worse, I was head over heels in love with a Vampire. Chapter Thirteen “How did your mother handle it?” I asked. “You know, when your father wanted to, uh, taste her?” Though we were sitting side by side on the sofa, Rafe was careful not to touch me. I appreciated his caution even as I longed for his touch. I was acutely aware of his nearness. His right shoulder and thigh were only inches from mine. The scent of his cologne tickled my nostrils. “From what I gather, she wasn\u0027t aware of it the first time.” “Really? What did he do,” I asked, “drink from her while she was asleep?” “No, while they were making love.” “Oh. Oh!” He smiled faintly. “They were making love the second time, too.” “Did she know it that time?” And even as I asked the question, I wondered how he knew the intimate details of his parents\u0027 love life. “Yes, and many times thereafter.” “I don\u0027t believe you. How could anyone enjoy being bitten, or having someone drink their blood while they were making love? It\u0027s…it\u0027s…” I searched for a word that would describe how I felt without offending him. They were his parents, after all. He supplied some adjectives for me. “Gross? Disgusting? Barbaric? Repulsive? Nauseating? Horrific?” He lifted one brow. “Should I go on?” “No, I think you\u0027ve covered it pretty well.” Ever so slowly and provocatively, he ran the tip of one finger down the side of my neck. It was the lightest of sensations, like a downy feather brushing over my skin. “Why don\u0027t you try it and see for yourself?” I jerked away as if his finger had turned into a venomous snake. “No way! I like my blood right where it is, thank you very much.” “Where\u0027s your spirit of adventure?” His fingertips slowly stroked my throat. “Aren\u0027t you the least bit curious?” I was curious, but I wasn\u0027t about to admit it, especially to a hungry Vampire! Instead, I said, “Just seeing you is all the adventure I need. As for being curious, you know what happened to the cat.” Raphael looked into my eyes, his gaze smoldering with desire, his voice low and husky as he murmured, “They say satisfaction brought him back.” The man was incorrigible! Those bedroom eyes, that sexy voice…how long would I be able to resist? How long until I surrendered to the yearning in his voice, the hunger in his eyes? “So,” I said, “tell me more about your parents.” With a sigh, he settled back against the sofa. “My grandparents are both Vampires. Late one night, they found a young girl giving birth in an alley. The girl abandoned the baby, and my grandparents adopted her….” “How did two Vampires raise a human baby?” “They hired a nanny and, later, a live-in housekeeper and a bodyguard.” “A bodyguard? Whatever for?” “My grandfather is a wealthy man, plus he\u0027s made a few enemies in his time. He couldn\u0027t protect my mother during the day, so they hired someone who could.” “Where did they find people willing to work for Vampires?” “No one knew they were Vampires, except for the bodyguard. Even my mother didn\u0027t know. They told her and everyone else that they had a rare disease that made it impossible for them to go out during the day. My mother was a grown woman before she found out the truth. Ironically, my mother fell in love with a Vampire, although she didn\u0027t know he was a Vampire at the time.” I shook my head, thinking it was the most far-fetched story I had ever heard. “It\u0027s true,” he said. “Every word.” He stroked my cheek. “Falling in love with mortal women seems to run in my family.” “I\u0027m glad.” “Kathy,” he murmured huskily, “I\u0027m dying for want of you.” His fingertips drifted up and down my neck again, ever so lightly. “Just one taste, please?” “And if I say no?” “I\u0027ll expire here at your feet.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-master-children-of-the-night-3/page-16.html","bookId":2301,"book":{"id":2301,"title":"Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3)","description":"Storyline: Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3) Passion Has a Darker Side...
