There was no mistaking the resemblance between them. They both had the same thick black hair, the same straight brows, fine straight nose, and full, sensuous lips. The only apparent difference was the color of their eyes—Rafe\u0027s were black while his father\u0027s were dark brown. I assumed one of the women was his mother, Cara, but which one? The lovely blonde with the beautiful blue eyes and flawless skin who sat at his right, or the stunningly gorgeous creature on his left? I couldn\u0027t help staring at her. Her skin was like smooth porcelain, her hair was thick and black and fell over her shoulders in rippling waves. She wore an elegant emerald green dress that exactly matched the color of her extraordinary eyes. Her only adornment was a heart-shaped ruby pendant. She, too, was a Vampire.\n It was amazing. All the Vampires looked to be in the prime of life. If I hadn\u0027t known that Roshan and Brenna were Rafe\u0027s grandparents, I would have thought that everyone in the room was the same age, for none of them looked older than thirty, and yet I knew Roshan had been a Vampire for hundreds of years.\n My nervousness ratcheted up another notch. What if his parents didn\u0027t like me? What if they hated mortals? That seemed unlikely, since his grandfather and his father had married mortal women. Still, I couldn\u0027t help feeling out of place.\n All my worrisome thoughts vanished when Rafe took my hand in his. His voice whispered through my mind. I love you now, forever and for always. For a single crystal moment in time, I saw only Rafe, his eyes dark with love and desire, his lips curved in a smile that was for me alone. His hand held mine, warm and firm and reassuring. He loved me and nothing else mattered.\n “Shall we begin?” Father Lanzoni asked. His gaze moved over those sitting in the pews and then rested briefly on my face and then Rafe\u0027s. “My children,” he said, his voice low and yet filled with authority. “You have come here this night seeking a blessing on your marriage, and I commend you for it. The secret of a long and happy marriage rests with the two of you. Always remember to put your loved one first and your own wants second. Treat your spouse as you would be treated. Remember how you feel this night, and I promise you that the love you have for one another will grow stronger with each passing day.\n “I will pronounce the words that bind you together legally, but the true joining must take place in your own hearts, your own souls.\n “Katherine McKenna, do you promise to love and cherish Raphael Cordova, here present, for as long as you shall live?”\n For as long as you live. A few short years, I thought, when he might live for thousands. With a sigh, I murmured, “I do.”\n “Raphael Cordova, do you promise to love and cherish Katherine McKenna, here present, for as long as you shall live?”\n Rafe gazed deep into my eyes, and I saw forever waiting for me there. “I do.”\n “Then, by the power vested in me, I pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss your bride.”\n Slowly, deliberately, Rafe drew me into his arms. My heart raced with anticipation as he lowered his head and claimed my lips with his. Sensual pleasure washed through me as he deepened the kiss, his tongue dueling with mine in a heady foretaste of what was to come when we were alone.\n I was breathless when we parted, and a little embarrassed when we turned to face his parents and grandparents, all of whom were beaming at us. Susie was grinning. Cagin gave Rafe a thumbs-up.\n Father Lanzoni cleared his throat. “May I present Mr. and Mrs. Raphael Cordova,” he said, a smile in his voice. “I suggest congratulations be swift so that the newlyweds can find a room.”\n My cheeks grew hot as laughter erupted through the chapel, and then we were surrounded by Rafe\u0027s family.\n The blond woman drew me into her arms and kissed me on both cheeks. “Welcome, daughter. I\u0027m sorry we didn\u0027t get to meet earlier.”\n “Yes, me, too.”\n “My turn,” said a deep male voice, and the next thing I knew, Rafe\u0027s father was giving me a bear hug that threatened to crack my ribs. “If he doesn\u0027t treat you right, darlin\u0027, you come and see me.”\n Roshan and Brenna hugged me in turn, and then Rafe\u0027s mother took me aside. “Don\u0027t be intimidated by us,” she said with a kindly smile. “And don\u0027t let Rafe force you into anything you aren\u0027t ready for, if you know what I mean.”\n “He already knows I don\u0027t want to be a Vampire.”\n Cara nodded. “It should be your decision, of course.”\n “Are you ever sorry that you asked Mr. Cordova to bring you across?”\n “No. Oh, there were times, in the beginning, when I missed being able to enjoy a summer day or a good meal, but they were small sacrifices to make when compared to what I gained.” She took both of my hands in hers and gave them a squeeze. “I wish you every happiness. If you ever have any questions you don\u0027t want to ask Rafe, please call me. I hope we can be good friends.”\n “Thank you, Mrs. Cordova, I\u0027d like that.”\n “Please, call me Cara.”\n “Thank you, Cara.”\n “Okay, that\u0027s enough,” Rafe said, coming up behind us. Slipping his arm around my waist, he kissed me soundly. “From now on, she\u0027s all mine.”\n “Raphael, aren\u0027t you going to introduce me?”\n The question came from the black-haired woman who had been sitting beside Rafe\u0027s father.\n “Of course,” Rafe said, smiling. “Mara, this is Kathy. Kathy, this is Mara. You\u0027ve heard me speak of her.”\n I could only stare at the creature before me. This, then, was the queen of the Vampires, the woman who had bestowed the Dark Gift on Rafe\u0027s father.\n “I\u0027m pleased to meet you at last,” Mara said.\n I nodded, still too stunned to speak. She hardly looked a day over twenty-five, yet she had lived for thousands of years. It was mind-boggling to think of all she must have seen in her lifetime. What had it been like for her to watch the whole world change, to see everyone she had ever known pass away while she remained forever the same? I had a million questions I would have liked to ask her, but of course, this wasn\u0027t the time or the place.\n A faint smile curved her lips, and then I heard her voice in my mind, soft and low, like a welcome breeze on a summer day. When you tire of being a mortal, call me and I will bring you across. It will be quick and painless.\n Startled, I blurted, “Why would you want to do that?”\n Rafe frowned at me. “Do what?”\n Mara turned her gaze on Rafe. “I was merely telling her that if she decided to join us, I would bring her across.” Looking at me again, she answered my question. “As for why I would do it, you might say I have a certain fondness for my godson and his father. As my fledgling, you will not be bound by the Dark Sleep.” Her gaze burned into mine. “Think about it.”\n She bid Rafe\u0027s family good night, kissed Father Lanzoni on the cheek, squeezed my hand, and vanished from our sight. The priest wished us well, and then he, too, simply disappeared.\n Cagin swore softly, then muttered, “I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll ever get used to that.”\n Susie laughed, and after giving me a hug and promising to call soon, she and Cagin left to pick up Susie\u0027s kids.\n With their parting, I was the only human left in the group. Of course, technically, Cagin wasn\u0027t human, either. I wondered if Rafe\u0027s family looked at me and, subconsciously, thought of me as prey. Were they all as happy to be creatures of the night as they appeared to be? Except for the blood thing, their lives didn\u0027t seem much different than anyone else\u0027s.\n “Are you ready to go?” Rafe asked.\n I nodded, and after another round of hugs and kisses, we left the chapel. There were more good-byes as his family followed us outside, and then Rafe and I were alone in his car.\n “You\u0027re very quiet,” he said after a time.\n “I\u0027m sorry, I\u0027m just a bit overwhelmed by it all, I guess.”\n “You were uncomfortable with my family.”\n “No,” I said quickly, though in truth, I had felt like a newborn lamb among ravenous wolves.\n “No?” He glanced at me, one brow lifted.\n “Well, maybe a little,” I conceded. “Can you blame me?”\n “No, love.”\n “What will our life be like, Rafe? Will we celebrate Christmas and Easter and birthdays?”\n “Of course.”\n “I\u0027ll have to call my parents and let them know about the wedding,” I said, thinking aloud. “Maybe we can go and visit them in a month or so.”\n “If you wish.”\n “Don\u0027t you want to?”\n “Of course.”\n I wondered if he would feel as awkward with my parents as I had felt with his. My parents would expect us to stay with them, to have breakfast and lunch and dinner with them. How would I explain it when Rafe didn\u0027t eat? One wall in the family dining room was mirrored. What would they think when Rafe sat at the table and cast no reflection in the glass?\n “I think the easiest thing to do would be to tell them the truth, don\u0027t you?” Rafe remarked.\n I shook my head in exasperation. There was no point in telling him to stay out of my head. One day I was going to have to learn how to build that wall!\n “I guess you\u0027re right,” I said. “I can\u0027t imagine what they\u0027ll think, though.” With a sigh, I rested my head on Rafe\u0027s shoulder. I\u0027d worry about it later, I thought. Now, all I wanted was to be alone with my husband.\n Rafe pulled into his driveway, then came around to open my door. Lifting me into his arms, he carried me into the house. When we crossed the threshold, dozens of candles sprang to life.\n “Oh, Rafe,” I murmured, “it\u0027s beautiful.”\n There were bouquets of roses and daisies everywhere. Dark red rose petals covered the floor of the entryway, releasing their fragrance as Rafe stepped on them.\n He carried me into the bedroom. There were more flowers there. The covers on the bed were turned down, the sheets were covered with hundreds of white rose petals. Candles lit the room with a warm golden glow. Soft romantic music played in the background. A bottle of red wine and two crystal glasses waited in a white wicker basket on the nightstand. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-master-children-of-the-night-3/page-50.html","bookId":2301,"book":{"id":2301,"title":"Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3) \n Passion Has a Darker Side... \n Kathy McKenna was sure that the little Midwestern town of Oak Hollow would be isolated enough for safety, but the moment the black-clad stranger walked into her bookstore, she knew she was wrong.
