Some said a Vampire\u0027s craving for blood was like a terrible drug addiction for which there was no cure. Vampires suffered intense agony if they were forced to go for long periods of time without feeding. It was a relentless pain, one that grew steadily worse. The only antidote was blood. In days past, Vampires had been locked up for years at a time. Some went mad with the pain, but none of them had died from it. The need just grew more and more excruciating, a hellishly endless torment that only blood or obliteration could bring to an end. I didn\u0027t want Rafe to suffer even a moment because of me, and yet…how could I let him drink my blood? He had told me once that it didn\u0027t hurt, but I wasn\u0027t sure I believed that. How could someone sinking their fangs into your neck not hurt? What if he took too much? I remembered the woman he had tried to bring across. Though he hadn\u0027t said as much, I was sure she had died because he had taken too much, or perhaps he had taken it all. “What do they look like?” I asked. “Your fangs?” “Like this,” he said, and bared his teeth. I guess I had been expecting huge canines, like a lion\u0027s, although I knew that was impossible. Rafe\u0027s fangs were neither as big or as long as I had imagined, but they were very white and looked needle sharp. Curious, I touched one with the tip of my finger and quickly drew back as it pierced my flesh. I stared at the drop of bright red blood. Sharp indeed! I\u0027d hardly touched the darn thing. I lifted my hand to my mouth, intending to lick the blood away. “Let me,” Rafe said, and taking my hand in his, he put my finger to his lips and sucked lightly. The heat of his mouth was unexpectedly erotic. A soft “ohhh” of sensual pleasure rose in my throat. If being bitten felt anything like this, I was surprised women weren\u0027t lined up for miles on end waiting their turn. I could see by the look in his eyes that he knew the exact effect his touch was having on my senses. He kissed my palm, his tongue stroking the sensitive skin, and then he let go of my hand. I looked at my finger, amazed to see that the tiny wound had already disappeared. “Sweet,” he murmured. “Even sweeter than I imagined.” “Blood isn\u0027t sweet.” “Not to you, perhaps, but to me it\u0027s like the finest wine.” “Well, at least you got your taste,” I muttered. “I hope you\u0027re satisfied.” “Indeed, but it only whet my appetite for more.” “If I let you drink from me this once, will you promise never to ask me again?” “Do you think that\u0027s fair?” “I don\u0027t care. Is it a deal?” “Yes, it\u0027s a deal,” he agreed, “but with one stipulation.” “What kind of stipulation?” I asked suspiciously. “I will not ask you again, so long as you do not ask me.” “You don\u0027t have to worry about that!” I said, completely confident that such a thing would never happen. “So, now what?” “Now this.” He slipped his arm around my shoulders, tilted my head up ever so slightly, and kissed me, a long, lingering kiss that made me forget everything but the taste of his mouth, the heat of his body intimately pressing against mine, and a growing desire that threatened to spiral out of control. I clung to him, lost in a world of sensual pleasure as he kissed me again, his hands skimming lightly over my back, my thigh, the curve of my breast. His touch was oddly familiar, as if we had made love a hundred times before. My whole being vibrated with need and with the excitement of discovery as my own hands moved over him, measuring the width of his shoulders, the hard wall of his chest, the silky texture of his hair. His lips were warm as they kissed their way to my throat, his tongue like a living flame as it laved the skin beneath my ear. Moments later, pleasure such as I had never known flowed into me and through me. In a distant part of my mind, I knew that he had bitten me, that he was sipping my life\u0027s blood, but I didn\u0027t care. He could take as much as he wanted, he could take it all, if it would make this incredible feeling last forever. I felt bereft when he lifted his head. “Don\u0027t stop,” I begged softly. “Please don\u0027t stop.” “I told you I only wanted a taste.” His knuckles stroked my cheek. “Are you all right?” “I\u0027m better than all right,” I said, and then, remembering how I had begged him not to stop, I glared at him. “You knew, didn\u0027t you?” I stabbed my finger against his chest. “You knew that once I let you do it, I\u0027d want it again. Didn\u0027t you? That\u0027s why you made me agree to that stipulation of yours.” He tried to look guilty but failed miserably. “It certainly explains a lot. I used to wonder why some women were so obsessed with Vampires. I couldn\u0027t understand why your mother married your father. Well, now I know.” “Is that right?” Laughing softly, he sat up, drawing me with him. “Kathy, love, you were ‘obsessed\u0027 with me before I ever tasted you.” “I was not!” I declared hotly. I straightened my clothes, embarrassed by my reaction to what had happened. I\u0027d been so sure it would be disgusting when it was quite the opposite. “Weren\u0027t you?” “You\u0027re mighty full of yourself all of a sudden,” I muttered sullenly. “I\u0027m probably no different from the hundreds of other women you\u0027ve had.” “There\u0027s one difference,” he said, cupping my cheek in his palm. “I love you. That makes all the difference in the world. When I drink from a woman, I make it as pleasant for her as I can. After all, she\u0027s giving me her life\u0027s essence, but it\u0027s nothing like what you felt. Love makes all the difference.” “And was it different for you, as well?” “Yes. Drinking from prey eases my thirst, but drinking from you…how can I explain it?” He considered a moment, then said, “Drinking from a stranger is like drinking water, but drinking from you is like savoring a rare and exotic wine. Do you see the difference?” It was impossible to stay angry with such a man. “Stop talking so much,” I said, “and kiss me again.” “With pleasure,” he murmured, and claimed my lips with his. He had tasted my blood and found pleasure in it. Even as my body responded to his kisses, I found myself wondering what it would be like to taste a Vampire\u0027s blood, Rafe\u0027s blood. The thought had no sooner crossed my mind than Rafe drew back. Wordlessly, he ran the pad of his thumb across the tip of one of his fangs, and then held out his hand. “Go on, satisfy your curiosity.” I don\u0027t know which was more disconcerting—having him read my mind, or the thought of actually tasting his blood. “What will it do to me?” He shook his head. “Nothing. It might heighten your senses for a few days, but nothing more.” “It won\u0027t make me a Vampire, will it?” He laughed softly. “No, love.” I stared at that single drop of dark red blood in morbid fascination. It was thicker, darker, than my own blood. Before I could change my mind, I quickly licked it from his finger. It was like putting my tongue to an electrical wire, and yet strangely pleasurable. Smiling, he drew me into his embrace again. I wasn\u0027t sure what the term was for it these days, but whether you called it necking, petting, or making out, that\u0027s how we spent the rest of the evening. I had never in my life been kissed so thoroughly, never been closer to losing my virginity, than I was that night in Rafe Cordova\u0027s arms. I experienced each gentle touch, each tender caress, with an intensity I had never known before. Was it love, or was it that tiny taste of forbidden blood that made the difference? I didn\u0027t know, and I didn\u0027t care. One taste of Rafe\u0027s blood had intoxicated me. If I could bottle the sensations erupting inside of me, I could probably make a fortune. I don\u0027t know how far we might have gone if he hadn\u0027t stopped when he did. Caught up in a sensual haze of passion, I stared at him as he gained his feet and straightened his clothing. “What are you doing?” Taking my hand, he pulled me to my feet and into his arms. “I need to go.” “Why?” “Because it\u0027s very late and you need your rest.” “What\u0027s the real reason?” “I haven\u0027t fed yet, and it will be dawn soon.” “Oh.” The reality of what he was hit me like a splash of cold water. He was going out to hunt for prey. He was going to drink someone else\u0027s blood, and he would be taking more than just a taste. “I\u0027ll see you tomorrow night.” Nodding, I lifted my face for his kiss. No doubt my lips would be swollen and sore tomorrow, I thought drily, but what the heck. He kissed me lightly and gave me a quick hug. “Good night, love.” “Good night.” I walked him to the door, watched him get into his sleek black car and drive away, and went to bed with a song in my heart and a smile on my face. I was still smiling when I woke the next morning, partly from my memory of Rafe\u0027s kisses, and partly from the dreams I\u0027d had the night before. Never in all my life had I had such erotic dreams. Had Rafe\u0027s blood been responsible? Just thinking of my wayward fantasies made my cheeks burn. If Raphael was half the lover he had been in my dreams…oh, my! I made my bed, ate breakfast, dressed, and went to the bookstore. I had no sooner opened for business when a delivery man brought me two dozen long-stemmed red roses. The only time I had ever received flowers before had been from my father. He had sent me an enormous bouquet of yellow daisies on my twenty-first birthday. I was pretty sure these weren\u0027t from my father. Filled with giddy anticipation, I read the card aloud. “For Kathy, lovelier than the fairest flower. Love, Rafe.” Half an hour later, another delivery man arrived. He handed me a heart-shaped box of candy. Smiling, I read the card. “For Kathy, sweeter than chocolate. Eternally, Rafe.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-master-children-of-the-night-3/page-17.html","bookId":2301,"book":{"id":2301,"title":"Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3)","description":"Storyline: Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3) Passion Has a Darker Side...
