I backed up another step and realized I wasn\u0027t alone. Glancing over my shoulder, I saw Rafe\u0027s grandmother standing behind me, her eyes glowing red as she watched the battle.\\n\\n “Do something!” I cried. “Can\u0027t you do something?”\\n\\n “I could,” she replied, “but Rafe would never forgive me for interfering.”\\n\\n I wondered how she could be so calm when her grandson\u0027s life was in danger.\\n\\n The creatures parted for a moment. Panting heavily, they stared at each other. Blood smeared their mouths and dripped from the numerous bites and scratches that appeared on both of them. Cagin seemed to be favoring his right foreleg.\\n\\n I held my breath, hoping the fight was over. Both were injured. Both were bleeding.\\n\\n Rafe took a step toward Cagin, his lips peeled back in a silent snarl.\\n\\n He froze, as did Cagin, at the sound of voices coming toward us.\\n\\n Between one heartbeat and the next, Cagin and Rafe resumed their own forms. Cagin turned and disappeared into the darkness between the two houses. Rafe vanished in a swirl of silver mist, as did his grandmother. If Cagin\u0027s clothing hadn\u0027t been scattered on the ground, I might have thought I imagined the whole thing.\\n\\n Tossing Cagin\u0027s clothing under a bush, I quickly made my way up to Susie\u0027s front porch and knocked on the door as if nothing untoward had happened and I was merely stopping by for a visit.\\n\\n On the sidewalk, a man and a woman strolled by, completely unaware of the life-and-death struggle their presence had interrupted. I wished I could thank them.\\n\\n As soon as they were out of sight, I ran down the street and didn\u0027t stop running until I was at home behind a locked door.\\n\\n With a sigh, I closed my eyes and rested my forehead against the wood.\\n\\n “Kathy.”\\n\\n Rafe\u0027s voice, so soft I thought I had imagined it. And then I heard it again, louder. Opening my eyes, I turned around, and he was there, his clothing stained with blood, his face, neck, arms, and no doubt the rest of him, covered with nasty-looking bites and deep scratches. Even as I watched, the smaller wounds were healing, fading, until only a deep laceration across his left forearm remained.\\n\\n I stared at him, at the faint red glow that lingered in his eyes, and knew what he wanted. I waited for him to ask, and as the seconds ticked by, I realized he wasn\u0027t going to. I was going to have to offer.\\n\\n My legs were shaky as I walked to the sofa and sat down. I was acutely aware of his gaze on my face. Leaning my head back against the sofa, I closed my eyes.\\n\\n “Just don\u0027t take too much,” I said, and my voice was every bit as shaky as my legs had been. He had bitten me before, but his desire then had been fueled by passion, not physical need. I wondered if there would be a difference. Would his bite still bring me pleasure? Did he see me now not as a lover, but as prey?\\n\\n My hands clenched as he sat beside me. His knuckles stroked my cheek, the length of my neck. Kisses followed in the wake of his touch, and then I felt the prick of his fangs at my throat. Pleasure flowed through me. I felt lighter than air, felt as though I could soar through the heavens. I wondered what he was feeling, and no sooner had I done so, then it was as if I was walking in his mind. There was pleasure there, too, mingled with an easing of physical pain. I felt his strength returning, and with it, his desire.\\n\\n I opened my eyes to find him staring down at me. His eyes were no longer red; the wounds that I had seen had healed, leaving no trace of a scar. Amazing, I thought. He looked strong and fit while I felt light-headed and a little disoriented.\\n\\n Muttering “stay here,” he went into the kitchen.\\n\\n I closed my eyes, wanting nothing more than to go to sleep, though I was certain to have nightmares after what I had seen.\\n\\n I must have dozed off, because the next thing I knew, Rafe was shaking my shoulder, pressing a glass of orange juice to my lips, insisting I drink. When I emptied the glass, he filled it again and coaxed me to drink that, too.\\n\\n “I\u0027m all right,” I said. “Don\u0027t look so worried.”\\n\\n He stroked my cheek. “What am I to do with you?”\\n\\n “Anything you want,” I murmured.\\n\\n I closed my eyes. Had I imagined it, or had I heard Rafe whisper, “No bad dreams tonight” before I slid into welcome oblivion?\\n\\n That night, I dreamed a wonderful dream. In it, Rafe and I were holding hands as we walked along a sandy beach. A full moon cast silver highlights on the surface of the water. The sand was warm beneath my bare feet, the air tangy with the scent of salt and surf, but it wasn\u0027t the ocean or the night that held me in its spell, it was the man beside me. He wore nothing but a pair of black trunks, and I couldn\u0027t stop looking at him, couldn\u0027t stop admiring his well-muscled physique. I was jealous of the moonlight that danced in his midnight black hair and caressed his tawny skin.\\n\\n A wave washed up on the shore, and I gasped as the icy water splashed over my legs. In an instant, Rafe had me in his arms, cradled against his chest.\\n\\n “Better?” he asked.\\n\\n Locking my arms around his neck, I murmured, “Oh, yes,” thinking that nothing could be better than being held in his embrace.\\n\\n He proved me wrong by showering me with kisses, one deeply erotic kiss after another, until I was on fire for him. “Rafe.”\\n\\n Just his name, but he knew what I wanted. He carried me across the sand to a sheltered cove. Miraculously, a blanket sprinkled with bloodred rose petals awaited us there. The light from a dozen candles cast flickering shadows on the rocks and sand.\\n\\n He lowered me onto the blanket; then, stretching out beside me, he drew me into his arms and kissed me again. Whether it was one kiss or many, I didn\u0027t know. His hands played lightly over my oh-so-willing flesh, making my body sing a new song. He was the master and I his eager student, anxious to discover the secrets behind his fathomless black eyes, willing to follow wherever he led. His body was taut beneath my questing fingertips, his skin smooth, cool to my eager touch, exhilarating to my senses. He let me explore to my heart\u0027s content, let me touch and taste whatsoever I desired.\\n\\n Ah, desire…it hummed through my veins, sizzled over my skin. The prick of his fangs only heightened each sensation, carrying me to dizzying heights, yet I climbed them unafraid because I knew Rafe was waiting for me there, just as I knew that he would never let me fall….\\n\\n I woke to the sound of my alarm, amazed that I had slept so late. I set the alarm clock every night as a precaution, but I always woke before it went off.\\n\\n Sitting up, I realized I was wearing a pair of pink bikini briefs and a T-shirt and nothing else. Funny, I didn\u0027t remember undressing or getting into bed.\\n\\n Rafe, I thought, he must have undressed me and put me to bed. I glanced at the other side of the mattress, frowned when I saw a faint indentation in the other pillow, as though someone had been there only moments ago. I ran my fingertips over the pillowcase, smiling as I realized that Rafe had spent the night beside me.\\n\\n The dream I\u0027d had flashed through my mind. Had it been a dream? It had seemed so real, the smell of the ocean, the feel of the sand and the sea beneath my feet, the taste of salt water on my tongue…the taste of Rafe on my lips, the heat of his body intimately pressed to mine.\\n\\n I shook my head. Of course it had been a dream. What else could it have been? We were nowhere near the ocean.\\n\\n Brushing away my confusion, I went into the bathroom and turned on the shower, only then remembering my visit to Susie\u0027s house and the fight that had ensued between Rafe and Cagin. Thinking of it now made me shiver. I had never seen such a bloody battle before, nor realized the extent of Rafe\u0027s ability to heal. And my blood had helped. It pleased me that he had come to me instead of going to a stranger. Everything about him pleased me, I thought, smiling.\\n\\n Ten minutes later, wrapped in a towel, I went to the phone and dialed Susie\u0027s number, felt a surge of relief when she answered on the second ring.\\n\\n “Susie! How are you?”\\n\\n “Hi, Kathy, I\u0027m fine, why?”\\n\\n “Nothing. I mean, I called you last night and you didn\u0027t answer and…and I was worried.” I decided not to mention that I had gone by her house, or that a Were-tiger and a pair of Vampires had been lurking in the dark.\\n\\n “Oh, I\u0027m sorry, I heard the phone, but Rick and I were on our way out. I\u0027m surprised the machine didn\u0027t pick up.”\\n\\n “That\u0027s all right. I was just, you know, worried. Where\u0027s your mother?”\\n\\n “Oh, she had to go home. My dad was in a car accident. He\u0027s got a broken leg and a few bruised ribs. The doctor said he\u0027ll be okay in six or eight weeks, but right now, he can\u0027t get around on his own.”\\n\\n “Are you staying by yourself?”\\n\\n “For now.”\\n\\n “Do you want me to come and stay with you?”\\n\\n “No, I don\u0027t think that\u0027s necessary. I\u0027m fine, really.”\\n\\n “Well, I\u0027m glad you\u0027re all right. You sound a lot better.”\\n\\n She laughed softly. “You know what they say, anything that doesn\u0027t kill you only makes you stronger. I\u0027m not crazy about what\u0027s happened to me, but I think I can live with it, although I guess I won\u0027t know for sure until the next full moon. The head Werewolf said he\u0027d send someone to talk to me before then, sort of help me adjust, you know?”\\n\\n “That\u0027s great. How\u0027s Rick these days?”\\n\\n “I think he\u0027s getting used to the idea. He took me to see the kids last night. We haven\u0027t told them yet…Rick wants to wait a little longer. He\u0027s probably right. There\u0027s plenty of time. Anyway, I\u0027m not sure they\u0027re old enough to understand what\u0027s happened.”\\n\\n “I\u0027m sure it will all work out. Speaking of work, I\u0027ve got to go; I just wanted to make sure you were okay.”\\n\\n “Thanks, Kathy. You\u0027re a good friend. Let\u0027s get together for lunch soon.”\\n\\n “Sounds good to me. I\u0027ll talk to you later.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-master-children-of-the-night-3/page-29.html","bookId":2301,"book":{"id":2301,"title":"Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3)","description":"Storyline: Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3) \\n Passion Has a Darker Side... \\n Kathy McKenna was sure that the little Midwestern town of Oak Hollow would be isolated enough for safety, but the moment the black-clad stranger walked into her bookstore, she knew she was wrong.
