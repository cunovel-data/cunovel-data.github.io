We were so different, how could we ever hope to make a life together? I shook my head. Today had its own problems. Tomorrow would take care of itself. I was wondering if I had enough time to run over and visit Susie and still open the store on time when Pearl and Edna breezed into the café. They spotted me immediately and came over to say hello. This morning, they wore long-sleeved, frilly white blouses, broomstick skirts, white sneakers, and ribbons in their hair. I wondered if they called each other to confer about their wardrobe choices. “Good morning, ladies,” I said. “What brings you out so early?” Pearl held up a sheaf of papers. “We\u0027re posting flyers for the Halloween Haunt, dear,” she said. “Is it okay if we drop one off at your store later?” “Sure. Or you can give it to me now and I\u0027ll put it in the window.” Pearl beamed at me. “Thank you, dear. You\u0027re going to come, aren\u0027t you?” “I don\u0027t know. I guess so.” “You must come,” Edna said. “And you must wear a costume.” “It\u0027s the day before Halloween, dear,” Pearl said. “You don\u0027t want to miss it. It\u0027s the highlight of the year.” “I\u0027ll do my best to be there.” Halloween had never been my favorite holiday. One Halloween, when I was about five, the son of our next-door neighbor had come over wearing a hideous mask and a fright wig and scared the living daylights out of me. I could still remember how terrified I\u0027d been. Even after John took off the mask, I had refused to go near him. I\u0027d had nightmares about him and that horrid mask for weeks after that. Even now, when I knew, rationally, that it had just been a rubber mask, the memory of that night still gave me chills. “Well, enjoy your breakfast, dear,” Pearl said as the waitress arrived with my order. “We have a lot of stops to make.” I watched Pearl and Edna as they moved toward the door. They stopped to chat with several of the diners before leaving the café. They were a strange pair. On the outside, they looked pretty much like any other women their age, although their clothing was sometimes a bit on the flamboyant side. But there was something just the slightest bit off about them, something I could never quite put my finger on. I was drinking the last of my juice when Travis Jackson slid into the chair across from mine. “Morning,” he said, smiling affably. “Mind if I join you?” “Not at all. I was just leaving.” “Aw, come on, sit with me while I have something to eat.” I didn\u0027t want to sit with him, but then, what the heck, maybe I\u0027d learn something that could be useful to Rafe. “Maybe just for a minute. I have to open the store.” “You\u0027re the boss, aren\u0027t you?” “Yes. So?” “So, who\u0027s to complain if you open at ten-thirty instead of ten?” As much as I hated to admit it, he had a point. Still, it gave me a good excuse to leave if I was of a mind to. Besides, I was hoping to squeeze in a visit with Susie. Travis ordered a stack of hotcakes, bacon, and coffee. I asked the waitress to bring me a cup of tea. “So,” I said, “why aren\u0027t you out doing whatever it is Vampire hunters do?” “Plenty of time for that,” he said, sitting back in his chair. “It\u0027s hours until dark.” “How do you find them?” “Hey, I can\u0027t divulge the tricks of the trade.” “Took a blood oath, did you?” I was kidding, but the sudden wary look in his eyes told me I had touched a nerve. “You didn\u0027t really? Tell me you didn\u0027t.” “I can\u0027t tell you anything, so don\u0027t ask.” For someone who\u0027d been so eager to talk the other day, he\u0027d become suddenly taciturn. My imagination immediately kicked into overdrive as I pictured Travis Jackson and his cronies huddling around a fire, swearing an oath of allegiance that they would never reveal their secrets or their meeting place, and sealing it with blood. I was glad when the waitress arrived with Jackson\u0027s order. I drank my tea as quickly as I could, burning my tongue in the process, said a quick good-bye to Travis, and grabbed my check. After paying the bill and giving Carrie a couple of dollars to give to the waitress, I hurried out of the café. Outside, I took a deep breath of the cool, crisp air, and then frowned. Something was different. Not wrong, exactly, just different. I glanced up and down the street and then, not knowing why, I walked toward the end of the block. The whole atmosphere of the town had changed. At the corner, I turned around and headed back toward my car. Why did everything feel so different? And then it hit me. On Mara\u0027s orders, most of the Vampires had left Oak Hollow. I was certain that most of the Werewolves had also moved on. The latent weight of preternatural power no longer hung over the town. The very air felt lighter, less oppressive. I wondered if Travis Jackson had also noticed the difference. I got into my car and drove down Main Street. Funny, I hadn\u0027t noticed how oppressive all that Supernatural power had been until it was gone. I glanced at my watch. It was almost ten. I tapped my fingertips on the steering wheel, debating whether to open the store or look in on Susie, and then I decided that Travis was right. I was the boss. If I decided to open the store late, or not at all, it was nobody\u0027s business but mine. Of course, with that cavalier attitude, I would soon lose the few customers I had. But today Susie had to come first. A few minutes later, I pulled up in front of her house. It was a nice place, with a wide front porch. A couple of pink hydrangeas grew on either side of the porch steps, a hummingbird feeder hung from a tree in the side yard. Bicycles and baseball bats littered the front yard. A late-model silver Caddy was parked in the driveway. When I rang the bell, a taller, older version of Susie opened the door. “Yes?” she asked in a cultured voice. “May I help you?” “I\u0027m here to see Susie.” The woman smoothed a hand over her ice-blue, tailored silk skirt. It had probably cost more than my whole outfit, including my shoes. “I\u0027m afraid she\u0027s not having visitors just now.” “I think she\u0027ll want to see me. If you could just tell her that Kathy is here.” “Kathy!” The woman\u0027s cool demeanor evaporated like morning dew. “Please, do come in. I\u0027m so glad to meet you! I\u0027m Myrna Lancaster, Susie\u0027s mother.” She ushered me into the living room, then took my hand in hers. “I can\u0027t thank you enough for what you\u0027ve done.” Tears filled her eyes. “Susie\u0027s my only child…I…her father and I…how can we ever repay you?” “That\u0027s not necessary. Susie\u0027s a friend of mine. Is she all right?” The woman\u0027s face sort of crumpled. Her shoulders slumped, and she sank down on the sofa. The tears she had been holding back trickled down her cheeks. “All right? How can she ever be all right again? Her life\u0027s ruined. And Rick…I told her not to marry him.” Myrna Lancaster shook her head and squared her shoulders. “I\u0027m sorry, forgive me. Of course she\u0027ll be all right.” “Of course,” I said. “Her father is, at this minute, discussing her case with our family doctor. We\u0027ll do whatever has to be done, no matter what it costs.” I didn\u0027t like the sound of that. If Susie\u0027s parents thought they could buy a cure for their daughter, they were sadly mistaken. As far as I knew, there was no cure for being a Werewolf. I hoped I was wrong. “Can I see her now?” Myrna Lancaster led me down a narrow hallway lined with pictures of Susie and her family. We passed a couple of small bedrooms. A peek inside one of them showed neatly made twin beds and a Spiderman toy box overflowing with cars, trucks, and dinosaurs. Susie\u0027s room was at the end of the hall. Myrna knocked on the door. “Susie, are you awake? You have company.” “I don\u0027t want to see anyone.” “It\u0027s your friend, Kathy. She\u0027s anxious to see you.” “Oh, come in.” Myrna Lancaster opened the door, and I followed her into the room. She smiled at Susie, who was sitting up in bed. “Can I get you anything, sweetie?” “No, thanks, Mom.” Myrna Lancaster nodded and then looked over at me. “Well, I\u0027ll just leave you two alone to visit,” she said, and closed the door behind her. Susie didn\u0027t look much better than she had the last time I had seen her. There were hollows in her cheeks, dark shadows under her eyes. She was still unusually pale and seemed thinner than I remembered. But it was the expression in her eyes that tore at my soul. She looked forlorn, haunted, but worse than that, she looked like she had lost the will to live. I sat in the rocking chair beside the bed and conjured a smile. “So,” I asked with forced cheerfulness, “how are you feeling this morning?” “How do you think I feel? Rick\u0027s taken my boys to his mother\u0027s house. My mother is afraid of me, and next month, when the moon is full, I\u0027ll turn into some kind of furry monster.” She waved her hand in the air, then let it fall back into her lap. “Other than that, everything\u0027s just fine.” “Do you want me to leave?” “No, please.” She reached for my hand and gave it a squeeze. “I\u0027m sorry. This is just so hard for me. I don\u0027t even know who I am anymore.” “I wish I knew what to say, some magic words that would make it all better, but…but maybe it won\u0027t be so bad. I\u0027ve met a couple of Werewolves, and they don\u0027t seem any different from anyone else, at least most of the time. I don\u0027t know what they\u0027re like when the moon is full, but maybe you could just think of this as another kind of monthly curse,” I said, remembering my conversation with Rafe. “You know, like your period and cramps, and maybe you could, I don\u0027t know, just make the best of it.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/night-s-master-children-of-the-night-3/page-26.html","bookId":2301,"book":{"id":2301,"title":"Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3)","description":"Storyline: Night\u0027s Master (Children of The Night #3) Passion Has a Darker Side...
